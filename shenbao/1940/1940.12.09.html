<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國與希臘</h3>
<p>當二十世紀初年，正是資本帝國主義勢力膨脹到項點，而若干文化古國則萎靡不堪的時候，曾經有人以各個民族的歷史演進比擬於個人生命的由少壯而衰老；因而斷定若干文化古國，有如埃及希臘印度波斯及中國，都已走上無可避免的衰老過程而無可救藥。此後的世界只有讓給若干新興國家去爭霸。這種說法，與當時實况不甚相左，以是在方式上甚爲動聽，而各個文化古國的命運也就好像早被造物所排定而無從擺脫。及至第一决世界大戰終結而後，民族主義的思潮彌漫全球，若干古老的民族也並不安於被註定的命運而力求所以自存之道；若干淪於半殖民地與殖民地的弱小民族，都在力事挣扎，與新興帝國主義國家爭一日的短長；因此，證明了所謂少壯衰老之分未必可靠。然而那種學說之全被推翻。却是由於中國與希臘這歐亞兩洲最古老的文化民族此决在力抗强禦中所提供的例證。</p>
<p>諦視目前的國際形勢，首先小能不承認中希兩民族在戰爭中的偉大貢獻。一九三一而後，前此大戰後所建立的世界秩序已被根本推翻：世人習於偸惰與苟安，亦復坐觀侵略荼毒之蔓延，於是野火瞬而在滿洲爆發，更復延及萊茵地帶，傾圯了阿比西尼亞王國，毀壞了西班牙的共和政體；號稱一等强國且負有維護國際正義與安寗之責的當時列強當局，竟瞠目袖手而無可誰何；以致征服亞洲征服世界的在想乃亦公然騰之文告報章，標榜其爲基本國策，使全世界的安全與秩序都重受威脅。假如當時不是中國起而應戰，以慘重犧牲換取遏阻侵略的效果，當不難想像此際遠東成何景象。世界蒙何影響。又如今夏納粹德國之發動閃電攻勢，不匝月而挪比崩圯，法國納欵，雖英國仍孤軍苦戰，誓小少屈，然對於軸心勢力的囊括中東歐洲並與日本深相結納以資呼應，亦復不免深感應付支絀，力不從心；設非希臘堅拒義方企圖，竭力抗拒。月餘以來，力挫强敵，幾使義軍在亞德利亞海東岸的據點全告動搖，則小惟東地中海與近東形勢益形艱危，南太平洋方面亦不免發生劇變，使侵略自慶莫可予毒。是以雖未來國際局面前途之如何演變，於今尚難逆睹，滔滔在瀾之匡挽，除中希兩民族之繼續振奮撑持而外，猶有待於有關列强的加以緊支援與積極應付，而已往一節段中，中希苦戰的偉大貢獻，確已在現代史上樹立了不可磨滅的偉績。</p>
<p>以中日之戰與希義之戰來比較　前者歷時久而大量消耗了對方的實力，後者獲勝速而嚴重挫折了軸心攻勢的銳氣；雖形式逈殊，以言貢獻則初無二致。中希兩邦一向都號稱積弱，在歷史上曾遭受異族的長期統治。已往政治也都經過混亂內戰的節段，而一旦起而抵禦强暴侵凌，輙能全國敵愾同讐，發揮潛力，使彼視弱小民族爲可欺而以爲侵略可以迅速獲逞者，轉不能不領受嚴重敎訓，飽受創痍之餘，且陷於進退維谷的窘境。這種奇蹟，並不見於丹麥荷蘭以至號稱一等强國的法蘭西，而獨有中國與希臘能在現代史中放一異彩，適足證明此二民族不惟小衰老。且正經歷着蓬勃鬱盛的新生，此其原因，還是需要從其悠久的歷史當中去尋求。大凡一個文化古國，允其是當其已往歷史進化　程中有過長期竚滯現象的塲合，自不免積累下若干腐惡渣滓，妨礙其正當演進，並在外觀上顯出衰頹萎靡的現象。而另一方面，其民族優良文化傳統，亦必具有深厚根源與堅實基礎；即使僅僅在社會機構的裏層潛隱的存在着，却絕不因多遭挫逆而消亡。並且一日遇有適當時機與運會。輒能爲之光大發揚，正有如草木之逢陽春，衰病者之得輸血。在對外戰爭中的今日之中國和希臘，都恰是這種情形。這以其認爲出乎意外，到不如說是必然的因果。就中希兩民族歷史而言，亦復多有在强敵壓境之際以苦鬥而絕處逢生的往事；古希臘的馬拉松與普拉提阿之戰，南晋南宋的淝水采石之役，都是以少禦衆，以弱勝强的顯例，正足以見其天賦之厚與潛力之强。今日的事實，正可以說竟是古代光榮戰史的重演，而壯烈偉大允過之，這並非民族的誇大在，也絕不是對於任何新興的國家民族心存菲薄，而只是根據現實以證明古老的文化民族並不一定衰老。而那些缺乏深切自我認識而一意冥行的國家，即使其國勢的隆盛僅止是不久以前的事，然曇花一現的强盛，在歷史上更多例證，將難免立即躬蹈衰頹的末運。</p>

<p>倫敦　路透社軍事評論家稱、義軍參謀總長巴陀格里奧上將之辭職或免職、乃極關重要之事、非俟吾人確知其爲辭職抑爲免職後、此　完全意義、難以估定、惟無論如何、此乃墨索里尼政治生涯中最大難關之徵兆、如巴氏因墨所迫而辭職、則情勢混亂信任缺乏、已可從此知之、墨氏殆知事態嚴重已極、不得不作特殊措施以期拯阿境義軍於滅亡、而恢復被希軍擊碎之法西斯威望乎、墨氏或希望易以新人挽回危局、但此果爲巴氏辭職之眞正原因乎、余認爲不然、蓋義軍局勢固甚危殆、更換軍事領袖徒使義國人民發生恐慌耳、今代替巴氏者爲軍界素不知名之人物、其人對於行欽經騐絞富、乃政治家而非軍事家、由此觀之、巴氏解職似非出於墨氏之逼迫、然則巴氏自動辭職歟、果雨則意義允爲重要、巴氏軍人也、品格名譽素聞於時、決不致於軍情吃緊時棄軍求去、但若不滿意於法西斯政權而反對法西斯政策、則非可同日語矣、法西斯所造成之危局、巴氏與有賓乎、巴氏自覺目前潮流、漸不利於義國、而知反對法西斯者、應及時崛起以應國人之呼訴、復使國家入於憲政正規而予義人以其正自由乎、此為巴氏之眞義未可知也、惟此種變更必求對於力弱精疲的義國加以不斷的打擊始可促成之，英國此時不當僅以穩健的軍事理由爲其行動之唯一指導、亦當統籌政治理　與戰地兵士及義國人民之心理而決定及時猛擊之策略、自古以來、凡大戰爭輒有以勇氣與冒險精神爲最可恃致勝方法之一、今此日殆已蒞臨矣、英希軍隊業已有小規模之聯合行動、今若英希艦隊會攻伐洛那而與陸地希軍相呼應、則阿境義軍將受致命之打擊、至於里比亞方面英軍祇須擊潰錫迪巴拉尼之義軍而驅之出埃及境、不必沿無水供給之唯一道路深入里比亞、卽足使德義日受軍事上與政治上極大影饗矣、（八日路透電）</p>

<h3>法政府籌劃　職團制度</h3>
<p>維希　勞工及工業生產部長裴林、昨日出席國務會議時、曾就其所擬「產業與職業新組織」一項計劃、提出報告、其內容係模仿中古時代之工團制度、所有職業、槪由國家統制、勞資之間倘若發生糾粉、亦由國家居間仲裁、據渠談稱、此項計劃、僅爲法國產業及職業之未來組織、奠定基礎、目前未必卽能解決、蓋以非俟法國社會機構完全改組之後、無法實施故也、抑　任國家、倘欲採用職業團體制度、非經過若干年之準備、不能見功、因此吾國苟欲樹立完善的職團制度、必須首先建樹新的道德標準、並制定新的憲法、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>維希　此間政界觀察家頃談稱、政府依照「合作主義」之原則、改組全國工業、勢將遭遇若干困難、因此有待今後數年之調整固矣、但在改組農業機構時、則較易着手、因此政府對於改組農業機構所制定之法律、預料當不難獲致具體結果、査全國人民之從事農業者、共有三千萬名之譜、今後將悉受現政府所頒「全國農村職業團體組織法」之節制、此項法律、實爲現政府之一大成就、其主旨乃在將合作主義之原則、灌輸於各農村、同時起草此法者、又參考外國之經騐、俾採其所長、以適應法國民族之個性與氣質、並規定依據各階級之共同利益、組織合作社性質的職業團體、以消除階級鬭爭、加之法國農村、素以自耕之小農居多、雇工入數反較地主爲少、是以組織此項職團、允屬較易辦理、惟是此項法律、在目前尚不能立卽付諸實施、政府擬先仟命委員三十人、組織一特別委員會、負責處理全國農業改組事宜、以爲實施此法之準備云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>歐戰痛史（五）</p>
<h3>華沙末日追記</h3>
<p>波蘭京城華沙的陷落，實爲這决歐戰史上最慘痛的一頁。這篇譯文是取材於美國著名攝影記者白里安Julien　Oryan所作「被圍記」＂Siege＂一書，祇因爲共他譯稿擁擠，不得已擱置到現在始行發表如下：</p>
<p>一九三九年九月七日晨一時，余等乘末决列車駛入華沙，在一片漆黑中行抵車站。旣離車，欲覓出租汽車不得，蓋已令被徵發充軍用矣。幸得馬車輛，遂偕數友乘之直駛歐羅巴旅館。</p>
<p>余初料該旅館中必有新聞記者雲集，乃竟十室九空，遂擇定附有浴室之大房間一，叩以租金幾何，招待員聳肩言明房租，然似不以金錢爲意。實則，此筆租金，余迄未付給也</p>
<p>翌晨得悉，波蘭政府業已遷出華沙，而新聞記者攝影記者暨新聞影片攝影師，亦均已全體離去。時余臨其地，似已無法　出矣，顧攝影家之理想，亦於此時實現，緣余身在遭受近代史上最慘烈的危城之中，乃可將華沙被圍之種種經過，收入鏡頭，不虞其他攝影帥之競爭也。</p>
<p>未幾又悉市長史達秦斯基已決定統率平貝死守華沙，眞危城中之英雄也。波蘭人一日存在於世，提及史達秦斯基之名，必足自豪，愛國之情，亦必油然而起。余向史氏申請攝影許可證，史氏藹然接見，並以沉着語調答曰，「我等必須留此，君則終須携照相出城，庶世人可知此間經歷如何。」（按史達秦斯基現已被槍決）</p>
<p>厥後，余留華沙之可怖時期內，絕未見史氏舉止失措。某决，余在其辦公室時，三十碼外落下炸彈兩枚，屋字搖撼如地震，隨後萬籟無聲，寂然如死，史氏處此境地，僅囑余不應憑窗，以免危險。顧彼本人留守迭遭轟炸之屋宇凡兩星期之久，寸步不離。史氏逐日播音，以勇敢之措辭激勵人民，謂政府雖已遷往他處，人民仍有主持者負責指揮。</p>
<p>史氏撥汽車一輛，及嚮導與舌人各一，供余應用，先往適被轟炸之天主敎大醫院。該院中彈五枚，彈穴直徑長皆達三十至三十五呎，時院中紊雜異常。其西端　屋已被炸毀，幸而未毀者，玻璃窗亦多被震碎，病榻上藥膏佈滿，外科室內上懸之反光鏡，搖搖欲墮，手術檯上亦藥膏零亂。</p>
<p>决日，新建六樓大厦亦中一彈。余抵其地，見婦孺屍體十四具，血肉狼籍，僵臥於地。靑年婦女被炸，首足不全，觀之允覺傷心怵目，厥狀可怖</p>
<p>華沙之死守不降，令人頗為感動。余曾視察產利醫院地窟，內有靑年婦女五十人，遭受轟炸砲擊之痛苦，或產生未久之嬰孩，被流彈或玻璃碎片擊中。然此輩靑年婦女，不問痛苦如何劇烈，皆具忍受之力</p>
<p>一日，余等驅車過市郊田野，稍遲一步，未及目擊一慘事，唯知有婦女七人，在田野掘山薯充飢，突有德機兩架飛到，向二百碼外小屋一橡投彈，屋內兩婦罹難。掘山薯之婦女皆撲臥於地，希望德　飛過，不予注意。孰科德飛行員意猶未足，俄頃飛返，向田野開放機關槍掃射，七婦中二人飲彈畢命。</p>
<p>余方對屍骸攝影，一小女孩飛奔而來，至一婦屍旁，婦其姊也。女孩呆立移時，失聲慟哭曰，一姊乎，姊果如何耶，曷語我，無姊余將何依。」</p>
<p>女孩旋以惶惑神情仰視余等，余張臂緊摟之，欲加慰勸，女孩復痛哭失聲，余及同行兩波蘭軍官亦不禁熱淚盈眶，尚能以何言安慰女孩耶。厥後，余與許多農民難民以至遭德機低飛不滿百呎開槍掃射之美僑交談，乃信德方實故意荼害平民。</p>
<p>余於攝取照相時，見一老嫗竚立瓦礫堆前，其已毀之寓所在焉。瓦礫中一爐尚存，爐火已熄，然爐十茶壺，煮水猶沸，仍嗞嗞作聲，蓋瓦礫中餘燼未滅，猶熊熊自焚也。數呎外有鐵床一具，僅剩骨架。老嫗惘然用杖挑撥瓦礫作搜尋狀，然所尋何物，恐老嫗本人亦不知也。又一老嫗，年逾七旬，木然而立，其寓所已全毀，携出銀匙二與剪刀一，此外卽一物無遺。近處則有一童，年約七齡，方蹴球為戲。另一處天井被火所灼，仍有餘勢，平民數家，集於天井，檢點剩餘之少許什物，僅聖母瑪利亞像，蔬菜一盆及被褥而已（未完）</p>

<h3>當局召集會議謀澈底穩定米價　今日下午在工部局開會對限價及利潤重新釐訂　米號業請將棧存囤米勒令出樣發售</h3>
<p>零市米業公會、前以米價飛漲、影響匪淺、曾於本月四日頒發緊急通告、限止米價不得超過本月二日之價格、又近日　價已見好轉、定購洋米、成本已可减輕、米價本可逐漸回跌、無如出於居奇操縱、市價竟反常飛漲、國米每石高至一百零八元、　米亦被抬至八十九元、升斗小民、幾難以爲生、若不迅卽獲得澈底解決辦法、前途不堪設想、兩租界當局有　於此、乃定於今日下午二時、在工部局會議室邀衆各幫米業領袖、共高穩定辦法、</p>
<p>重行釐訂限價利潤</p>
<p>今日會議甚爲重要、除决定調查集中上　存底外、並重定每包限價及應得利潤、将雷厲風行、嚴竣　行、務使達到抑平米價之目的、同時復將商討集款一千五百萬、長存洋米二十萬包、儲囤公倉、備作公　之建議、至限價究將規定每包二百甘二斤爲若干元、聞有人主張、以仰光米價每包合法啟八十元、米業公會前定跟價爲九十六元、聞今日會議中、有定爲九十．元之說、若果屬實，則每石價格、爲七十　元、此則甚望到會諸人、能以民食爲重、而須鄭重考慮者、至一號貢米之出口、據稱二月、日可以解禁、在此一時期中、滬上存米、綽綽有餘、似無須乎恐慌、且至新米上市時、公倉公賣之辩法、届時亦可實行矣、</p>
<p>米號業要求售棧米</p>
<p>當局云、敬啟者、　會各同業米號設鋪零售米糧、與其他务業之商店性質相同、絕非經營投機者一也、逐日進貨銷售、無時不在歡迎主顧之購買、絕非囤積不售者二也、貴進貴出、賤來賤去、售價公開、絕非居奇圖得非分之利潤者三也、成本加　、週轉困難、絕無龐大之資力而壟斷者也、我同業散遍全市、家數衆多、營業競爭、絕非三五家少數而可操縱把持者五也、同業進貨時、一如主顧之向店家買米、希有　價、而賤進</p>
<p>決無意圖</p>
<p>抬價者六也、　上六點、爲盡人皆知之事實、一般人士、雖明知而不察底蘊、往往誤會指摘、以致怨　隨之、　遭不白、如此代人受過、對齡一己著者尚小、關於社會安甯及　　　紀者實大、此則不得不切實聲明者也、當此非常時期、百物昂貴、而米價尤漲無止境、民生困苦、達於極點、市塲紊亂、險象環生、有貨者尚</p>

<p>儲糧問題一般意見</p>
<p>前虞洽卿氏提議訂購洋米二十萬包、儲存本市、作抑平米價之用、米業團體應擔任十萵包、除六萬包業已由雜糧業豆米業認購外、其餘四萬包、亦可分別認購、此外十萬包、除銀錢業允訂購儲糧五萬包外、不足之數、将由其他有力團體擔任、惟據一般人之意見、是項米糧、旣作平抑本市米價之用故　張　成本公　、遇必要時、可平價出售、對於米業耍求自由買賣、更須審慎研究、</p>
<p>電請放行一號貢米</p>
<p>法越當局禁止一號西貢米出口事、使本市米商業已訂購之八萬五千包定貨、運滬受阻、竟能影響本埠米市、荳米公會除業巳函呈本埠法總領事轉電法越當局放　外、並擬電請越南中華商會交涉、據米業某君談、此項業巳訂購之米糧卽使目前不致放運来滬、但至明春西貢新穀上陳之時、當可如　　滬、且一號貢需要不旺，無關大市也、</p>
<p>米市制度亟須改革</p>
<p>昨據熟悉米市之某君稱、目下米市、已失正常交易、非澈底改革、無法使之穩定、但決非一紙文告及議決案所能衆效、對於入塲營業之米商、須嚴格限制、除非效法雜　業之辦法、准許經售商米行　米　得入塲營業外、餘則一概禁止、方能　到客售舆行、行　舆號之正常營業、而致米市於穩定之途、</p>

<h3>經濟戰爭　中國已獲勝利　三國貸款計美金四萬萬武器充實後戰局卽改觀</h3>
<p>據本埠金融界某君語人中社記者、自中國對日抗戰以　、英美蘇對華備用放款、總數不下美金四萬萬元、中國政府發行之外幣債券、尚不在內、以前美國對華放款、每批不過二千五百萬元、英國每次亦僅二百五十萬鎊、但此次美國一次借款、卽達一萬萬元、英國亦將一次貸華一千萬鎊、合美金四千萬萬元左右、足證英美援華之積極、中國獲此鉅款、財政益形充　、戰事前途、異常樂觀、</p>
<p>勝敗之數已極明顯</p>
<p>蓋中日兩國經　狀况、一長一消、勝敗之數、巳極明顯、此次英國借款、舆前二次不同、蓋以前借款側重於匯市之平準工作、過去會爲日人利用不少、此次則　要用途爲購買英貨、範圍擴達於英國各屬地、尤爲　　　際、蓋此時英德戰事方酣、德國之飛機潜艇、甚爲猖獗、英島四週沉船每週恒在十萬噸左右、而英國本身、對戰爭材料、需耍方殷、勢難同時供給外國、</p>
<p>外國物質充分利用</p>
<p>故中國所有英國貸款、尚未　　、完全因運輸關係、英國本部物資不易運來遠東、此番物品採購地點擴大爲英鎊集團國家、卽爲補救以前之缺點起見、以後緬甸印度澳洲一帶物資、中國均有利用之機會、最近自由中國因與緬甸接壤之關係、內地民衆、日用所需、多取給於緬甸·印度·如棉紗·棉布·米轂、近來均有大量運入西南、故此後不但政府所需物资得取給之便　、卽後方民衆日用品、亦多一供給來源、絕無　資被利用之危險、較以往不分區域之無限制供給所獲多矣、</p>

<h3>今日上海之民食問題</h3>
<p>— 劉錫章</p>
<p>要討論今日上海的民食問題，我們應分抗戰前後兩點來看。抗戰前有一種看法，抗戰後又有一種看法。抗戰以前，固然要袪除米慌，但在方法上第一還要顧到整個經濟，例如洋米與國米，以及穀賤傷農等等問題；而在抗戰以後的今日，我們雖仍以袪除米慌為主，但是為了上海環境的特殊，只得採取比較可行的辦法。卽不能純粹從理論上出發，應惟顧到事實為第一。</p>
<p>形成今日上海的民食問題，第一是因爲國米的來源一天天减少，而且受了「統制」，最初是採用限價政策，原定限價十四元突破了，不久而打破到十六元，又不久而打破十七元，此後便是倍數的高漲，一直到最近的一百元以外。限價政策所以不能維持，投機之外，國米來源受了「統制」是一點，洋米底盤受了產地滙價的限制又是一點。此後上海的所謂米巿，便是洋米為主體的米巿，國米的巿價是受洋米支配的。這時候，洋米的巿價雖是在不斷高漲，但是來源，還是相當暢通，所以投機者的壟斷，是有限度的。但到了今天，則越南洋米的來源因了局勢緊張的關係，已經有限度地受了阻隔，（但是到船還是每天有）投機家可能抬高的限度，就遠比從前為大。因此，為了上海的民食，第一最好是疏通國米來源，但這是辦不到的，就事實上論，只好退一步來疏通洋米來源。這所謂疏通，可以有兩種解釋，第一個解釋是直接向外洋定米，第二個解釋是把本埠存米暫時間調整一下，以救濟目前的恐慌。</p>
<p>此次食糧恐慌問題的起源，最大的原因就是爲了上述洋米產地發生了政治問題，妨害了運輸的　通。因此其價格的上漲，絕非產地價格的上漲，而是本市獨特的上漲，今日漲五元，明日漲十元，這決不是運費保險費或各種成本的上漲，而是投機家「人爲」的上漲。</p>
<p>抗戰前後的食糧</p>
<p>因此，我們就先來看上海有無米慌可能。形成上海米慌有兩個主要條件，第一是存底有限，第二是來源斷絕，現在先來看存貨。</p>
<p>關於糧食的存底，各家發表的數字不同，有人說只有數十萬包，也有人說有幾百萬包。究竟若干，自然沒有人知道。然而從各方核計，則是數十萬包的存底，顯然是太少了；說這句話的人，如果不是淺薄，那末，一定很容易疑心他受米蛀蟲的朦蔽了！我們根據事實，可以先行決定上海食糧存底不缺，其理由如下。</p>
<p>前幾天各報發表某經濟統計機關的統計，（載本月七日各報）用三種方法證實上海洋米存底的豐富，第一是根據關冊，以進口减去出口，再除去消費，結論上海應存洋米四百萬石。第二是根據倉庫報告，一年來增加二倍。第三是根據到貨統計，最近四日每日到洋米都在數千包以上。這三點，第三點完全是事實；第二點告訴，米是有加無增；第一點比較不甚可靠，一因私運進口者不在內，二因洋米之往虹口者或亦未計及；至於隔年存底，國米的來源，則更未計及。據此數端，我們可以知道近年來本埠存米量，必經常的在一二百萬包以上。</p>
<p>爲什麽大家都愁米慌的光臨，而我們偏激賞於存底的豐厚呢？我們最應該注意的，便是今日民衆的備糧，已大非戰前可比。戰前中人之家，備一包二包的米的甚少，今日則中人以上之家，不購米則已，一購便是十包五包！消耗了二包，再購買五包，如此陳陳相因，米底自然愈積愈厚。每人當然知道上海今日的環境，也當然知道未雨綢繆，所以「多備米，這是一般家庭的原則。還有集團購米，使大家對糧荒問題格外驚心怵目，也無形中有提高囤米的傾向。這並不是反對集團購米，也可以說是指出集團購米給予我們的效果。過去上海的囤米，是寡頭的，是米蛀蟲，是投機家組合的財團，而在今日，則存底除了上述二者之外，還分配於一般中人以上之家，前者是寡頭的，而後者則是普及於大衆，這兩者堆存的數目，孰多孰少，是非常明顯的。</p>
<p>再說到來源，洋米來源相本並不斷絕過，西貢只禁止一號洋米出口，並未禁止二號洋米出口，不過到船沒有過去的有秩序。卽使來源有問題，鬧成上海米慌，也還是將來，而不是一年半載的現在！</p>
<p>然則上海的民食問題的癥結在什麼地方呢？主要的地方，是在辦理民食問題的人，技巧有問題。在越南多事的時候，本來惴惴然的上海民衆，深恐食糧斷絕，已有大量囤積之意；但其時，又有人發起大量集團購米。這時辦集團購米是隊的，喊集團購米眞是要不得。何况還在高喊設倉儲米等不能實行的　足高調，更令人有居心叵測之感了。因爲明知越南多事，進辦不比平時容易。却偏勸人大量買米；若非見識淺薄，便是抬高米價嗎？所謂集團購米，原希望價格獲得一些便宜不受米蛀蟲的剝削，試問在這時候購米，米的來源旣非指日可　，豈不是只有向本市搜羅在存米？一方面慫恿人家買米，一方面又事實上不向外洋買米，豈不是等於把市塲上的有限制洋米，加以無限制的抬高？米價漲高，中人以上之家有　無息，還不成問題；而靠每天工資收入的勞苦大衆，則不能不忍痛出高價以果腹。提倡購米者本來是一種善意，可是實際上則爲米蛀蟲與投機家製造發不義之財的機會，事實的痛心無過於此，舉動的不聰明也無過於此了！</p>
<p>補救的辦法</p>
<p>我們旣認爲統盤計算，眼前上海全部的存貨，足以應全部人民相當長期的消費；所以第一步是應該舉行界內食米的登記，包括私人與機關，限制其過額囤積，並且由工部局，或商團，於必要時，得以公平價格收買過額堆存的米，而以平價出售。同時，由工部局領導商團備米若干萬石，作爲太平米，爲整個上海民食問題留準備。此項米款，不必由銀錢業墊款，可發行公債，力避當事人的挪栘與取巧。</p>
<p>對於集團購米，應由工部局領導各商業團體組一機關，辦理其事，每日公布產地價格，專受委託代購。</p>
<p>總而言之，今日的上海民食問題，不息寡而患不均；這時期只有用調整的辦法，來鎭壓投機家故作的恐慌。</p>
<p>末了，我們還得提出兩點事實：第一，食糧騰貴對平民的影響遠較富人爲重，所以一切壟斷行爲是最殘忍的。第二，民食壟斷的結果，必　影響到整個社會秩序，這一點允其不能不注意！最後（一）我們希望全市倉庫及米業的從業員，檢查檢査自己的薪給收入與家庭開支的情形。要知幫兇也是自殺！要知檢舉米奸，你們比任何人方便。（二）奉勸中上之家，不可冉一味自掃門前雪，助我投機者的奸計。（三）奉勸倉庫堆棧業普遍的限期出倉；又奉勸銀錢業普遍的禁做米押款，已做者即催贖。</p>
<h3>我國中央銀行制度之發展</h3>
<p>— 李葆江</p>
<p>近代銀行之發展，顯有一種趨勢，卽大都有一强有力之中央銀行控制市塲信用，其他各種銀行無不視中央銀行爲後盾；故論銀行制度者，莫不以中央銀行爲焦點。</p>
<p>所謂中央銀行，實爲銀行之銀行；負有控制金融之使命，言其性質，亦與普通銀行不同。蓋其業務不當與普通銀行相競爭；任務至少有四：一曰統一發行，視社會經濟需要，通盤籌劃以伸縮通貨之數量，穩定市塲之金融；二曰集中準備，接受商業銀行之存款準備金，對於各商業銀行隨時負有週轉調劑之責任；三曰代理國庫，掌司政府財政一切之收支；四曰規定利率，施行票據之再貼現政策或施行公開市塲運用以管理市塲之信用。有此四端，中央銀行始得成爲一國金融制度之首腦，而爲穩定市塲金融之中堅。</p>
<p>戰前之進展</p>
<p>我國於民十七以前無所謂中央銀行；中交二行實際上具有中央銀行之性質。當時中交二行分支行處，遍佈國內；所發鈔券，通行全國。鹽關稅款亦由該二行代理，深得中外人士信仰。十七年十月，國民政府始頒布條例，設中央銀行於上海，惟以國內金融情形複雜，直至八一　抗戰時爲止，我國中央銀行對於上述各條件，似猶未能一一具備；故在民國二十六年戰事未起之前，政府曾頒布中央儲備銀行法，　改組現存之中央銀行，以澈底完成中央銀行之任務。惜因戰事爆發，乃得暫告停頓。</p>
<p>我國中央銀行因歷史關係，在種種方面，不得不求中交二行之合作；於是隱然形成三位一體之銀行機構。民國二十三年七月，財部爲維持金融安定，公布儲蓄銀行法；凡儲蓄銀行吸收存款後，至少應將儲蓄存款總額之四分之一購買政府證券及其他擔保確實之資產，交存中央銀行保管庫；實爲準備之初步集中。二十四年春，金融市塲極度恐慌，由中中交三行共同放款，始克安渡難關；此種救濟市面之法，實爲向所未有。及民國二十四年十一月，財部公布新貨幣法，實施法幣政策，集中發行準備，統一鈔票發行；商業銀行運用現金，惟政府銀行之法幣是賴；政府銀行無形中多一控制信用之工具。民國二十五年，中央銀行復正式參加票據交換所，票據淸算基金由中中交三行共同保存，實爲我國金融制度重大之進展。</p>
<p>唯就集中準備言，儲蓄銀行雖應將其存款總數之四分之一購買證券，存交於中央銀行，但係證券而非現金，　僅限於儲蓄存款部份，商業存款不在內，而票據交換所之淸算基金又按四四二比例分存於中中交三行，故準備亦不能謂爲澈底集中。就利率言，我國商業票據根本不發達，復無票榔貼現市塲，商業銀行票據貼現業務極少承做，中央銀行更無再貼現業務可言，何遑談及貼現政策。就鈔票發行言，雖已統一，然發行權猶分散於四個國家銀行；代理國庫，乃爲中央銀行特賦權利，自易辦到。</p>
<p>戰後之建設</p>
<p>然自抗戰以來，政府爲穩定戰時金融計，已有各種富有建設性之措施，我國銀行制度，乃加速其健全性之發展。</p>
<p>甲，叫行貼放委員會　八一三戰事旣起，當局卽頒布安定金融辦法，限制提存，同時於上海成立貼放委員會，復令中中交農叫行就各該行所在地設立聯合辦事處及聯合貼放委員會，專司辦理農工鑛之貼放及轉抵押等事宜；俾各業生產，得以進行；商品流通，　以暢建。惟四行行政，若仍各自獨立，則　收集中事　，指揮裕如之效；故進而有四行聯合辦事處之設；此項機構，實已具備中央銀行之雛形。</p>
<p>乙，四行聯合辦事總處　欲明瞭四聯總處之性質，吾人祗須觀察其業務與組織：査四聯總處之最高行政機關乃爲理事會，由中央銀行總裁，副總裁，中交農三行董事長，總經理，以及財政部經濟部所派之代表數人組成之；理事會主席及常務理事三人，照規定均由國民政府特派之；而理事會之主席，更直接受財部所賦予之特權，可爲便宜之措施，幷得代行四行之職權。至於四聯總處之職權與業務，擇其要點，當有以下諸項目：（一）四行劵料之調劑，（二）四行之聯合貼放事項及戰時特種生產事之聯合投資，（三）全國金融網之設計分布，（四）資金之集中與運用，（五）受託小額幣券之發行與領用，（六）內地及口岸滙款之審核，（七）外匯申請之審核，（八）戰時物資之調劑，（九）收兌生金銀之管理，（十）特種儲蓄之推行，（十）（一）四行發行準備之審核與四行預算決算之覆核，（十）（二）派員對於四行業務之視察及四行工作之考核。可知四聯總處實爲一戰時余融集權之機構，負有一種直接指揮，管理，監督之責。</p>
<p>此種組織，類似美國之聯邦準備制，使中中交農四行可成爲整個有機體之運用。唯其對於市塲信用控制之能力以及中央銀行應具之特質，則仍有澈底改進。</p>
<p>丙，存款準備金　我國中央金融機構旣已確立，進一步則當硏究如何逐漸完成其集中準備與規定利率之任務。故在本年八月財行所頒布之非常時期暫行管理銀行辦法中卽曾明白規定：「銀行經收存款，除儲蓄存款應照儲蓄銀行法辦理外，其普通存款，應以所收存款總額百分之二十爲準備金，轉存當地中中交農四行任何一行，並由收存行給以適當之存息。」查此制亦與美國各會員銀行之情形相類似。蓋因應付提存之發生，美國各會員銀行必須向當地聯邦準備銀行交存存款準備金，特其存款準備率與我國略有不同：如中央準備城市爲百分之十九·五，普通準備城市爲百分之十五，鄕村準備城市爲百分之十•五；蓋愈繁華之區，銀行款項之進出亦愈巨，則存款準備率亦應愈高。美國當局復視金融狀况而升降，此項準備率，藉以控制各會員銀行之拆款。至於我國規定存款準備者，除具有一般義意外，復含有特殊之用意：卽（一）應埶提存，保障存戶之安全；（二）按制各銀行信用之挪張；（三）制止投機囤貨等。</p>
<p>我國向無存款準備之規定；就各種統計觀察，民國二十四年上海十二家銀行（存款總額皆在三千萬元以上）平均之現金準備，最高有在百分之三十五左右者。然究其實除，我國銀行之所謂現金準備，實包括庫存，運送途中，及存放同業三項目。例如收入存款三千萬，除存放同業者，則手頭現金實僅存一千萬元，若存款準備僅以庫存現金爲限，則按上統計，十二家銀行現金準備平均在百分之八與百分之十二之間；大體上則多在百分之十左右，此與倫敦相較，實相一致。以此比率應付平時提存，當無困難之理；但應注意者：我國情形與英國不同，英國爲信用制度發達之國家，故百分之十之比率足以應付普通之需耍；至於我國，對於票據流通尚未養成使用之習慣，故在平時維持百分之十之比率，卽已不能謂爲穩健之比率；更遑論戰事發生之後？故此决非常時期暫行管理銀行辦法中將習慣的百分之十改爲法定的百分之二十，實爲良佳之舉措；亦爲我國國家銀行控制市塲信用之叉一種進步。</p>
<p>丁，推進銀行承兌貼現業務暫行辦法　尚有一點値得吾人欣慰者，卽最近財部頒布推進銀行承兌貼現業務暫行辦法，令飭四行提早實施票據承兌以及貼現重貼現等業務。是項辦法與中央銀行之再貼現政策關係甚巨。</p>
<p>在承平時期，中央銀行利用貼現率之升降，可以控制市塲信用；當市面信用過度膨脹時，中央銀行卽可提高再貼現率使各普通銀行有所警戒而不致濫事放款，市塲籌碼自可隨而减少；反之，當市面信用過度緊縮時，中央銀行卽可降低再貼率，使各普通銀行有備無息，從容貼放，市塲籌碼自可遂漸增多；利用此項辦法，金融市塲遂得賴以穩定。</p>
<p>我國信用制度，尚不發達；商業習慣，債權債務，多以記賬爲憑，鮮有利用商業票據。債務人固有坐受倒賬之累，又因記賬賒欠償期呆定，資金亦有凍結之虞。然商業票據，原可充信用工具；因其發生，又必以實際交易爲背景；其本身有其流動功能，向銀行貼現後，除貼現人外，尚有承兌人連同負擔淸償責任。而在貼現與再貼之中，則又可發揮其糾正商業交易不芷當之活動矣。</p>

<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—十二月七日—　中美金融全作（續）</p>
<p>這一回的空前大借款，意義非常的重大，遠非美國對中國在戰時其他的經濟援助所能企及。美國每於日本對中國國民政府作有損害的舉動時，卽採取若干種有利中國抗戰的措施，如漢口陷落後的二千五百萬美元借款，滇緬公路封鎖時的對日禁運若干種必需的材料，以及前此日本加入軸心國時的二千五百萬美元借款。此决的援助，不但力圖抵銷日本承認所謂「南京政府後的任何嚴重影響，實在是對日本成立一種不合法制度，使日本獨佔優勢，而剝削美國所久享的平等的公允的待遇底一種打擊。國務卿赫爾氏說：美國在遠東的基本政策是擴展可能的物資與金融以幫助中國，因爲中國正抵抗侵略的力量而繼續與日本大規模作戰，以阻止日本建設所謂「大東亞新秩序」。財長糜根索說：如欲維持遠東的現狀，必需援助中國。中國若能獲得充份的經濟援助，卽能成立一堅固的防禦，如此，間接上卽能阻止日本再進一步公開損害美國的利益。兩氏之語，眞所謂「慨乎言之」，則此决借款的意義底重大，與夫對遠東大局的影響，母待贅言了！</p>
<p>拋開政治意味不談，就前文的分析，專就金融上加以論述。關於信用借款部份，則在互利的條件下，中國以自已的資源來襄助自己的金融，足見中國作戰潛能力之强，不必多所解說。關於五千萬元平準法幣之事，按九月二十八日金融述評中對第三决的二千五百萬元借款說：「折合英鎊其數的爲六百餘萬鎊，較之二十八年中英平準基金數額計佔五分之三强，其對於中國法幣滙價的維持，自勝過當時英國五百萬鎊所援助的力量」。又說：「中美間是不是會因此而發展到合作穩定法幣的途徑上去，正難預料，但是美國巢眞希望中國抗戰以牽掣日本在南太平洋上的行動，則在金融上的合作我們正未可說是因供給外滙上需要的二千五百萬美元而起的幻想」所謂在金融上的合作底幻想也者，果然是因美國藉中國抗戰以牽掣日本的一點上實現，它所給予中國的援助，並不是像英國的五百萬鎊，而爲的合英金一千二百餘萬鎊的巨款。目前中國正遭遇有利的局勢，如美國陸軍力量在太平洋的增强，英美澳關於新加坡暨其他太平洋地帶的防守談話，今美國復在五千萬信用借款外益以同數用以平準法幣，對於中國戰時幣制的穩定，抗戰經濟力量的加强，自屬顯而易見。　（未完）</p>

<p>（一）膏方採取國藥有効成份：國藥種類之繁，功効之大，已爲世界所公認。惟提煉精華，未臻普遍，是以病家欲求服食之便利者，恒多捨此而就彼。惟膏方則不然：膏方於脩合者，處處已提煉精華，採取有効成份。其於植物質者，煎時宜先浸一二宿，俟浸胖，多汁者搗絞取汁棄渣，少汗者武火煎取汁，堅靭者文火煎取汁，有揮發性者俟　煎畢時煮一二沸取汁脩膏，庶其氣味皆全，不致失散。涌經活血者，先以酒水同煎，再合於膏，庶收入血流通之力。其於礦物質者，煎時先搥細，再用密絹包煎，庶質地純細，人腹卽生作用，而無沉滯之息。燒成炭質之物亦然。至於有加入動物質者，如羊腦羊腰牛骨髓猪脊髓羊肉鹿肉之類，皆各有其脩治之法，使達完美之作用。是以膏方之提精，爲最合科學方法者，使其方而配合得當，數十味中無相反相惡而悉具君臣佐使之善者，則其收効之速，逈非他藥所可比擬。</p>
<p>（二）膏方調理各部面面俱到：吾人身體所需耍者曰蛋白質曰含淡物質，曰炭水化合物質，曰脂肪質，尚有存在於各種物質之維他命，以爲營養及生長，以及使身體各部細胞皆呈活潑之用。偶有偏缺，則病態發生，若損失過多，則精神頹廢。膏方所含植物質，不但能推陳致新，使各部健全，且常有維他命補助人生之需要。一般中藥所用礦物質及炭質，常有整理腸胃及淸潔血液之功，而所用之動物質，多屬近人所謂臟器療法有强肚之作用，有補損之効力，視其何部需要而配何物，故面面俱到，實有不可思議者在也。</p>
<p>（一）膏方用膠脩合處處咸宜：膏方之俯合，用龜板膠或　皮膠鹿角膠等，旣用以滋陰補血或扶陽，各有所宜，且一經台膏，久藏不壞。他如用鹿茸麋茸等責軍藥品者，收入膏內，可以毫無損失，耐心服用，決無流弊，此用爲常期補品之最合理者。最好每晨關水冲化服一匙，質少而効大，可佐晨點，可解燥渴，婦孺能服，百病可用，（風寒外感除外）數百年來相傳不衰，良有以也。</p>
<h3>氣喘及其治法</h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>一入冬季，患氣喘病者獨多，而允以老年人爲甚，氣喘之症，俗稱哮吼，醫書上名之曰痰飲氣喘。</p>
<p>高年之輩，氣血較爲衰弱，本力不濟，猶之機器上之動力部份力量較少，推運能力薄弱，肺內積聚痰液，亦無力溫運。此種痰水，其性屬寒，吐出爲蟹沫狀，白色有泡，吐出不久，下沉者皆爲水液。不吐時則聚於肺胃，黏連不化。久而久之，愈積愈多，痰質愈積愈堅，竟成塊壘，在醫舉上卽名之爲痰飲，伏於肺胃，經年不消。肺部吐納，失其健全，終日痰聲漉漉，吐之綿綿不絕。待至冬令，北風一起，外界寒冷感受，水分愈無溫運之能力，生痰更多。略受風寒，卽起咳嗽，更以痰飲中阻，氣機阻逆，故而作喘作哮，喉開漉　如拉鋸聲。然日間痰塊猶在肺之下部，如於夜間臥下，則痰飲平舖肺部上口，氣喘更見逼塞，哮吼令人不能合目，竟致不能平臥，只得高疊被枕，以求喘息。若其人腎部素虧，則丹田之氣，全無攝納能力，其痛苦更不堪言。凡年在四十以上，一至冬日，多有是症，其病病情，皆類上述，其病病源，皆陽氣衰微，溫運無能，身中無大故耳。</p>
<p>治此症全在壯火溫陽之法，止喘潤肺化痰，皆非此症根本治法，如其病者爲自己减輕痛苦起見，可在秋季或初冬常服　子炒米粉。以附子二兩炒米粉（卽平常炒米研粉）八兩和勻。病輕者分三十天服完，重者分十四日服完，均每日服一决，或乾服，或開水調服，皆收非常效騐，（如少年痰火喘咳向有吐血者以外，老年痰飲服此效騐如神）一至冬季宜進服壯大溫　之藥劑，可服　子肉桂泡薑麻　葶　之屬，始能根本治此，吾則逐年病根深種，愈發愈重，甚非所宜。故當冬令方屆之際，卽爲調治時機，一待蜷縮牀頭，藥力亦較遲矣。</p>
<h3>冬季之外症</h3>
<p>— 張贊臣</p>
<p>—凍瘡—時屆冬令，天氣嚴寒，北風凜冽，人身凍瘡，應時而起，其原因多由於溫度之劇變，如從高溫暖室中，突至寒冷之處，或由寒冷工作後，卽用火爐取暖，或從大風雨雪中歸來，卽用熱水洗滌等等，每致發生。叉如童幼高年，營養不給，抵抗力弱者，或愛好時髦，少穿衣服者，均易發生局部之凍瘡。此則因血液感受寒冷之激刺，持續不散，血行因之障碍，內外膜及肌膚亦因之損傷，於是凍瘡遂形成突。</p>
<p>凍瘡起於局部者，先爲潮熱微滙，膚熱徵痛，瘋癢等等是也。大的可分爲初中末三期：第一期　之紅斑形，皮膚先呈蒼白，後變　虹紫浮腫，　癢灼煞等。第二期爲水泡形性，膚色褐赤，內含汚血之液，若水泡破裂，則表皮剝離，變爲潰瘍，陷於壞症　第三期名爲壤症，患處色靑，週圍色紅，遇冷則痛，遇熱則癢，瘡口深淺不一，滋水淋漓，而爲壞症，如是者，急宜就外科醫生診治，防其綿延而至惡化也。</p>
<p>凍瘡之治法，在初起惟有保持其局部溫度，不使太暖，亦不宜太冷，而防患於未形。若經輕度凍傷，日以溫湯洗滌數决，或以溫和軟布摩擦患處，使血液運行，而無停流，則可消散於無形。若已破潰，則其治法，與未潰者不同，蓋一則宜溫散，一則宜提毒收口，故潰後治法，須分二期。初潰用煆石膏五錢，烏賊骨錢半，靑黛八分，大梅片五分，共研細末，麻油調敷。若潰瘍期已過，改用煆石膏五錢，炒東丹錢半，冰片四分，（研末）以黃凡士林少許，調成軟膏，用紗布一方，塗膏其上，貼之自愈，或用藥粉乾摻亦可，惟均須每日更換，至結痂爲度，世之息凍瘡者，幸注意及之。</p>
<h3>冬季靑年　應注意之一端</h3>
<p>— 允聖從</p>
<p>靑年有患遺精者，至冬令而遺泄史甚於平時。攷　原因，厥有數端：其一，冬夜長於夏夜，諺云。『夜夜夢多』，夢多由睡眠不熱，或因時間過多而不欲眠，或因氣候嚴塞而成眠，强而入夢，因夢致息。其二，冬季用被褥，每求溫暖，溫暖覆壓，易多接觸，因之幻成夢境。遂以致病。其三，冬令少汗小便轉多，腎氣不足者，夜中之小便允多，而寒氣侵入，不願　床如厠，多方按捺，膀胱滿　，迫壓精系，因內部之刺激而成之，其四，冬季因寒冷之關係，早晨醒後，不卽起身，留戀　衾，又　朦朧睡去，此時　易成患，故此息發生於早晨者爲多。</p>
<p>根據上述原因，故遺精者，於冬令應注意下列數點。（一）臨睡前少飲茶水，以免小便增多。而刺戟精系。（二）睡時上覆之被不宜過重，足部不可過暖，或謂兩足宜露於　外，亦可不必：（三）睡時，切忌仰臥，下足彎曲而直伸其上足。（四）醒後如有尿意，速卽小便，不可按捺。（五）晨間醒後，不論遲早，卽行起身，不可戀留被中。靑年如爲此息所困者，望注意之。</p>
<h3>冬季流行病</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>傷風感冒，受寒發熱，鼻　流涕，此爲平時最多之恙，値此冬令，天氣　寒，如其衣服寒暖不能適度，更易息之，凡傷風者，常須七八日，流涕欬嗽，則達半月之久，雖屬小恙，往往爲一切發熱病（如傷寒，溫病，濕溫，）之起初病象，若錯失治療之時期，或治之不愈；易　纏綿之病，傷寒溫病，因是而成，故不能以小恙而忽略之。</p>
<p>惟所謂感冒，約有三端，一爲傷風，爲患甚輕，僅僅傷感風邪而已，一爲受寒，爲息較重，發熱較劇，並有骨節　楚之象，一爲單單發熱；無惡寒之象，分述如决：</p>
<p>（一）傷風：此係感冒風邪，鼻塞時流淸涕，微有欬嗽，身熱頭褒，頭部畏風，肌膚亦微有漸漸畏風者，投以疏散風邪，淸凈肺部之藥劑，必須待其咳嗽停止爲標準，服藥不可半途而廢，因有少許咳嗽餘留，易致遷延時日，傷及肺部。</p>
<p>（二）受寒：此係感冒寒邪，較前者爲重，發熱蒸蒸然，畏寒較甚，無汗頭痛，週身或骨節痠疼非常，或頸項週轉不甚　便，須服疏散風寒藥方，服藥後再飲熱水一碗，裹被而睡，求得汗液，卽愈。</p>
<p>（三）發熱：起初單單　熱：絕不畏冷，身熱頭暈且痛，口乾作苦，苔黃乏味，大便不甚通暢，小便色赤此爲傷寒初起，如其不畏冷，不必重用出汗法，須解表與淸理腸胃並用，初時可用通大便之法。</p>
<p>一切感冒發熱初起，大別之多爲上列三類，按症投藥，皆能收效，初入冬季，因皮膚尚未收縮確定，最易感冒，允以職業界中人士，辦公室與家庭間之溫度高下相差過鉅，或備高熱度水汀，或則不備暖具深寒澈骨，最易招致發熱之病，允有好作夜遊之輩，時而困坐暖室，時而出征寒風，中寒愈探，發病愈甚，傷寒，冒感遲早難免矣。</p>

<h3>封鎖綫內</h3>
<p>— 固榕</p>
<p>上星期六的下午三點鐘，照例乘了一路公共汽車回家去，可是到了靜安寺，愚園路口擠滿了人，「什麽事？」特「別戒嚴！……」「走不通了，怎麽辦？」很多人這樣嚷着。於是公共汽車祇能右轉灣，我也祗能不自主地下了車。一時被扣留的人慢慢增多了，因此形勢更趨緊張，人聲更爲嘈雜。「上决人還能走，這决連人都不能走了！」「不知要幾時才能開放？」「等到牠幾時！不如外面去吃晚飯，住到親友家裏去或是開旅館。」差不多受了同樣影響的人都這樣吵着。我雖然很鎭靜的站在那裹，可是心裹也不免在着急，在想方法，終於在朋友家吃完晚飯，已經八點鐘了，打了十幾决的電話到家裹去，方才打通，知道已開放可以通行了，這是一個可喜的消息，於是飛也似的趕到了家，弄堂裏家家戶戶，大大小小都把這個嚴重的問題作爲談話的中心，大家猜測一定還有被封鎖的可能；果眞，九點鐘後又不准通行了。於是形勢叉緊張起來，但也無法可想呀，祇能靜待明天也許可以開放。</p>
<p>一夜沒安睡，一早就起身，出外探聽消息，可是結果失望得很，除了外邦人外一概不得通行。因此報紙信件全斷絕了。到了九十點鐘，弄堂內擠滿了人，因爲鐵門兩面都關閉着呢。行動旣不能自由，言語總算還可隨意談論，於是聽到有些學生們囔着：「今天幸而是星期，吾則怎樣到學校呢！」商店裏的人在發怨言：「生意也攪光了！」當家的大人都在担心着吃的問題，以致意料之外的弄堂裏幾家南貨店雜貨店，煤炭店，食品公司等，反而生意特別興隆，不多時存貨已賣去了大半。到了午後，每個人見面差不多問的總是「今天吃什麽菜？」回答的總是說：「吃素呢！」還有許多少奶奶們，很會適應環境，利用時光，她們的主張是旣不能出外，不如打牠三十二圈冉說。我們天天在外的，現在一旦被軟禁，更是難受，祗能家裏走到弄堂裏，再　弄內的店穿到馬路上，人很多很多的站在那裏，好像看然鬧一樣，他們都離開鐵絲網的有丈外的光景，看那些行人呀，車輛呀，走到那邊總是「打同票，連外邦人也是一樣。</p>
<p>今天該到學校了，可是路不通，祗能不去呀。後來知道有許多人乘一淸早出來打「交涉」，靠着「維他命M」的力量，給于通行了。不久又得到一個消息，知道由漁光村對面的</p>
<h3>尼姑庵的故事</h3>
<p>— 仟炯</p>
<p>近來，尼姑庵裹「生意淸淡」，眞可謂「門可羅雀」了！就是有幾個香客，也不過是「求夢」打「花會」的，或是幾位老主顧的白髮婆婆，尼姑們心理實在有點提不起勁兒來。</p>
<p>突然，今天來了個白面書生，鼻樑架起「托力克」的無邊眼鏡，穿着西裝，尼姑於是覺得有點「異樣」——因爲男人不大涉足庵堂，師太們也就認爲「奇貨可居」了，不過，想想總覺得道樣的書生來做「香客」，似乎不大妥當，耍不是走錯了「院子」？這眞弄得尼姑們「丈二和尚」摸不着頭腦！</p>
<p>我們的來客在一杯香茗以後，開明他來庵的「宗旨」了，說是爲了近來貴庵「生意淸淡」，特帶「喜訊前來，超脫各位師太，早離佛門苦境。原由是爲了上海有個「機關」不招「已結婚的女人」，，至於已經錄用而未結婚的，慢慢地也在走上「結婚」的道路，弄得「機關」裏的一些老爺們氣死了，「剛剛訓練好」批，又得換一批，他媽的，用女人眞討厭！」但是，他們想，不用女人，外面說話不好聽，用了女人，又得生他媽的孩子，「做事不專心」，因此，乾脆的僱用大批「永不會」生孩子的女人，那祇有師太們最適當了。我們的來客說完了，得意地摸了一摸下巴，趁手呷了一口香茶，等着尼姑們的回答。</p>
<p>尼姑們自然是得意忘形的了，可惜的是尼姑們不够資格，怕攷不取，因此，尼姑也得上學讀書，要繳騐高中「文憑」。</p>
<p>果然，不出所料，錄取的全是尼姑，而且卽使尼姑「勿規矩」肚子裏有了小尼姑，但是「尼姑　胎」是「名正言順」的；因爲她們沒有「結」過「婚」啊！</p>
<p>於是，全中國原有的尼姑，全被搜羅得乾乾凈凈，但爲了尼姑庵是好去處——「機關」女職員的「準備機關」，所以大批新式的摩登尼姑—女學生，都開起庵堂來了！</p>
<p>因此，中國到處是尼姑庵，尼姑事業也特別發達起來！錢家巷可通到極司非而路，於是很多人像哥倫布發現了新航路一樣地前去試探了。我們當然也不會例外，到了靜安寺，似乎呼吸到了不同的空氣，可是要到學校已來不及，因此買了些東西就回來，晚上很早就睡覺，準備明天一早走那條路上學去。</p>
<p>到了學校，同學們都帶着驚奇的目光問我怎樣出來的，我就說了些大概，上課時人在敎室裹，可是心裏却在着急假如冉不准走又將如何呢？</p>
<h3>「起碼」</h3>
<p>— 余壁</p>
<p>早餐無菜，想買些「果肉」下下口。當我從袋裏摸出一張五分的分幣來，店夥輕蔑地斜睨了我一眼，冷冷地說：「起碼一角。」</p>
<p>往事歷歷如在目前，當前年故鄉淪陷逃難來滬的時候，兩個銅子三個銅千還可以買一包，但下半年就「起碼二分」了；去年上半年，一改而爲「起碼三分」；下半年，分幣發生恐慌，代價券，郵票濫觴一時，馬上叉是「起碼五分」；現在又一躍而成「起碼一角」，昇騰的程度眞是可驚呵！「果肉如此，其他呢，還用得到我來喋喋嘵嘵嗎？</p>
<p>「起碼」，「起碼」，這幾個字令人看見了就頭疼。（現在孤島上似乎到處充塞着有形無形的「起碼「啊）這樣「起碼」，「起碼」下去，眞苦了我們靠薪水生活的「起碼入」了。</p>
<h3>老鼠的哀告</h3>
<p>— 蘇農</p>
<p>「我是隻老鼠！</p>
<p>「但你們別以爲我祇是一隻老鼠，我却寄居在一間華貴的屋子裏（雖然屋子差不多耍坍塌了，但陳設總是華貴的）：又何况，這兒的主人還是有名的「闊老」呢！</p>
<p>「可是你們也別羨慕，這是一點兒沒有理由可以羨慕的；因爲，主人闊是闊的自己，「倒霉」的是我啊！你們想：一點點剩飯怎麼能夥飽肚子。</p>
<p>「有幾次我實在餓極了，就去咬主人的桌子，衣服……可惜得很：主人非但不「了解」我，反而勃然大怒，竟連剩下的飯粒也統統給哈吧狗吃了！吃了！</p>
<p>「哈吧狗在「受寵」之後，就「驚」得在吠起來。我恨極了，就偷偷地去咬了一口狗尾巴……</p>
<p>『這一來可眞惱了主人，不知道從那兒弄來三隻野貓，整天價守在我的洞口！</p>
<p>「於是我連僅有的「目由」也被剝奪了，不得動彈；肚子又餓……</p>
<p>「主人終日笑着；哈吧狗跳着；野貓叫着。</p>

<h3>章臺柳</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>儒生聽着，臉上不由變色，剛纔的笑容頓時收斂，　手頻搓，嘆口氣說道：「如是，我不能說你的話太激烈，太有鋒銳，使我聽了如芒刺在背，心頭難過起來。你確乎是個奇女子，烏得以　臺　人看待？魯國漆室女便是你的一流。哈哈，你也有紅拂那般慧眼，能在濁世中識得李藥帥這般英雄嗎？至於我也並非祇知肥遯鳴高，不顧國事。當初我在復社中，自問愛國之心，不後於人。徒以魏　竊政，忠良絕跡，鈎黨之捕，遍於天下，被害的，遷徙的，幾被一網打盡。所謂君子道消，小人道長，這是大意，也是明朝的氣運。因此我們大都抱哀郢之痛，不得不作江湖之思，沒奈何而如此，心中也何嘗不作杞人之憂呢？你是深知我的，也必能諒我。今日何出此言？實傷我心。」說罷，又是跌足太息。麗人道：「小女子怎敢傷我恩師的心？這幾天多讀了些謝臯的詩，心頭棖觸，不能目己，所以斗胆在恩師面前胡說八道。凡救亡圖存之計，最好能做得早，做得先，事後補救，必定格外困難了。范仲淹先憂後樂之志，這正楚士大夫的好榜樣。我深惜今日一般有學問的人，還楚不能眞切地去救國。也恨我做了女子，出身微賤，有心無力。倘得化身爲男子，必要烈烈轟轟地去幹他一番呢。儒生拍案大聲說道：「如楚，你說得好不爽快！可以愧煞鬚眉了！我本賞識你多才多聞，不比尋常裙釵，今日一席話，有幾個女子能够說得出？佩服佩服，你眞是奇女子了。我要賀你一杯。」說罷，連忙提起酒壼，斟滿了一杯，舉起來一口喝完。父在麗人面前傾滿了一杯，說道：「你要乾杯的。」麗人謝了一聲，帶笑帶喝，也把一杯酒喝下肚去。儒生父什絳子斟了一些，說道：「你也喝半杯，賀你姊姊。」綘子笑了一笑，拿起杯子，喝了數口。（四）</p>

<h3>Completion of Far East Red Army Reform, Prepared to Deal with Any Contingency. The U.S. Also Plans to Send the Navy to Cruise the Pacific to Ensure that Officers and Soldiers Will Not Be Isolated in the Event of War</h3>
<p>Moscow – Military officials here stated yesterday that the Soviet Union's Far East troops are now prepared to deal with any contingency. It is reported that since the recent abolition of the political commissar system, military and political reforms have been completed after consultation between the Communist Party and major units. At the meeting, General Pupkov, commander-in-chief of the First Far Eastern Army, praised the army's strong combat power. He said, "Our army has a terrible strength, and we are very proud of it. We are especially proud of the tradition of Khasan (note: Khasan was the site of contact between Soviet and Japanese forces in the Nomonhan Incident from 1933 to 1939). We are now strongly united, obeying the orders of our beloved leader Stalin, and ready to fight at any time. We are prepared to deal with any most difficult situation and eliminate the enemy." General Stein, the current supreme commander, said that the Soviet Far East Army "should be familiar with the experience gained from modern warfare." (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Moscow – At a meeting of the Far East Front Military District yesterday, General Pupkov, commander of the First Red Banner Army stationed on the Far East Front, declared, "We are prepared to start fighting temporarily and are prepared to defeat any enemy under any circumstances." General Stein, commander of the Far East Front, analyzed the Red Army's preparations, explained the shortcomings, and asked commanders and political workers to study the experience of modern warfare, saying, "The current situation urges us to work harder to complete the Soviet military power." Another military conference was held in Moscow, where the head of the political department stated that given the international situation, the Red Army must be prepared to follow the orders of the Party and the government at any time to protect the interests of the socialist motherland. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington – According to unconfirmed reports here yesterday, following the U.S.-Australian Pacific defense talks, officials have begun to study the possibility of sending the navy on a goodwill cruise to the Pacific. If this cruise is implemented, the Philippines, Singapore, and Australia will be essential stops. The broad meaning of the cruise is to reassure the Pacific region and disappoint aggressive countries. In a narrow sense, there are countless reasons: (1) to demonstrate the power of the United States Navy; (2) U.S. visits to British territories are sufficient to show friendship with Britain; (3) to familiarize U.S. naval officers and soldiers with all military ports and other facilities, so that they will not be isolated in the event of war. Sources in communication channels said that the matter has not yet been definitively decided. Whether this matter is implemented depends on the environment in the near future. In other words, it depends on the policies of Japan and the Dutch East Indies, and the status of Britain in the Atlantic. Since acquiring 47 new training ships, the United States has been able to operate in Hawaii. Naval personnel recalled that Captain Knox once said that a goodwill visit to Australia is a very good method. Other officials have repeatedly advocated holding such a cruise and should include the Pacific region. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London – The Daily Mail predicted today that the U.S. neutrality law will not last long. The newspaper suggested that the U.S. Navy could send ships to protect U.S. ships carrying military supplies to Britain. The newspaper also pointed out that after the neutrality law is further revised, President Roosevelt can dispatch a fleet for protection. (International News Service dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>U.S. Government Officials Are Discussing Plans for Economic Aid to Britain</p>
<p>Washington – A dispatch from a U.S. news agency in Washington stated that it is now known that government officials are discussing plans to provide financial assistance to Britain. The plan is divided into two points: (1) Britain must use its funds invested in the United States to purchase military supplies; (2) The United States may agree to grant Britain a loan when Britain's investment in the United States is exhausted. Those in power believe that Britain has sufficient financial resources to purchase military supplies in the United States for one year or more. However, they want to know where funds can be obtained after one year. It is said that the British side believes that Britain needs to be promised future loans for the following three reasons: (1) to support British morale; (2) to plan the purchase of military supplies in the long term; (3) U.S. manufacturers can rest assured that they will be able to expand factory equipment and accept British orders if they know that future payments are guaranteed. Discussions in Congress and elsewhere have focused on asking Britain to designate gold bonds and West Indian assets as loan guarantees. According to local sources, Britain's assets in the Americas and the Far East can be included in the loan conditions. Because Britain must have a kind of additional guarantee product, so that the American people who have not forgotten Britain's last war debt welcome loans to Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts – Harvard University Professor of Political Science, Iliot, yesterday advocated expelling the German and Italian consuls stationed in the United States and limiting the number of Japanese and Soviet consuls to a minimum. He also stated that the most superior strategy for the United States at present exceeds: (1) clearly issuing a warning that if Japan attacks Singapore or the Dutch East Indies, the United States will definitely respond; (2) expanding the Monroe Doctrine to include neutral Ireland and escorting convoys to Ireland by navy; (3) periodically paying for the profits of British asset mobilization at market prices and accepting the position of shareholder in the resources of the British Empire; (4) repealing the neutrality law. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>U.S. Warships Are Modified to Defend Against Air Raids</p>
<p>Washington – Naval Secretary Knox yesterday requested Congress to allocate $3,000,000,000 to modify warships so that they can more effectively deal with air raids. Captain Knox said that the defensive engineering on the ships is confidential and cannot be disclosed. However, he also said that war equipment and combat experience are part of the defensive needs. It is generally known that unofficial sources say that the Navy Department had previously planned to install multiple anti-aircraft guns on the ships, believing that this is a more effective method of air defense.

<h3>Weekly War Situation, December 1st to 7th</h3>
<p>In Hubei, the Japanese army, on the eastern front, launched an offensive from Maping, Xihe, and other places in Suixian County towards Lishan. Another force advanced from Zhongxiang towards Changshoudian and other places in the western foothills of Dahong Mountain. The Japanese army on the western front joined forces with the Japanese army that crossed the river near Zhongxiang on the eastern front, and advanced northward from the line of Dangyang, Yuxi River, and Jingmen, coordinating land and air, with a very fierce momentum. The Chinese army inflicted heavy blows on them. By the 29th, all routes had collapsed. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue, successively taking Weishidian, Jingmingguan, Kuaihuo Ridge, Li Ba, Jinji Ridge, Anju, Junchuan, Hejiadian, Tangjiachong, Jiuli Mountain, Ta'erwan, Huantan, Zhangjiaji, Majiaji, Changshoudian and other places on the eastern front, directly approaching Zhongxiang and Suixian County. On the western front, they successively captured Kuaihuoguan, Lijia, Xianju, Zengjiawan, Lixi, Yanchi Temple, and other places, advancing to the outskirts of Jingmen. All remaining Japanese troops in various places were eliminated. In total, this battle annihilated more than 20,000 Japanese soldiers below the rank of regiment commander of the Kawahara Brigade, creating the recent great victory in that area. The so-called winter offensive of the Japanese army has been completely crushed by the Chinese army. On the northern bank of the Xinqiang River in Hunan Province, there were fierce battles between the Chinese and Japanese armies from time to time. The traffic on the Yue Duan Railway of the Japanese army was frequently destroyed by the Chinese army, making transportation extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Anhui and Jiangxi</p>
<p>The Japanese army in northern Anhui, advancing from Shouxian and Suxian, in central Anhui from Wuwei, and in southern Anhui from Dongliu, suffered heavy losses after being severely attacked by the Chinese army last week. The Japanese army that advanced from Dongliu to Zhide was annihilated by more than 20 troops, and the city of Zhide was completely recovered by the Chinese army. On the 30th, the Japanese army again transferred thousands of troops from Jiujiang, northern Jiangxi, to Pengze. At noon on the 1st, they advanced towards China in four routes from Pengze, southeast and two sides, Malukou, Huangtuling, and nearby areas. After three days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese momentum was thwarted. Until the day of the call, the Chinese army launched a full-scale counter-offensive. The Chinese army surrounded the Japanese army on three sides in the Malukou area, and the Chinese army launched a large-scale Huai attack in the Huangtuling area, recovering Huangtuling at 3:00 AM that morning. The defeated Japanese troops fled in droves, and part of them advanced to Taipingguan, where they were ambushed by the Chinese army. They retreated again to Fenghuang Mountain. The Chinese army's offensive was fierce, and they recaptured Fenghuang Mountain and Taipingguan. A spokesman for the Military Commission of Chongqing said that the important battle situation on each front this week is as follows:</p>
<p>Hubei and Hunan</p>
<p>The Japanese army trapped on both sides of the river had been heavily besieged by the Japanese army since the 23rd of last month, and there was a possibility of being completely annihilated by the Chinese. The Chinese army, which attacked Anyi, northwest of Nanchang, once attacked into the city and burned the Japanese army's warehouse, causing heavy losses to the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Shanxi and Henan</p>
<p>In the Qinyuan area of ​​Shanxi Province, the fighting has been fierce for days. Since last week, thousands of Japanese troops have advanced in separate routes. One route, with more than 2,000 people gathered from Linfen, Hongdong, and Zhaocheng, attacked east via Anze. Another route, with more than 2,000 people, attacked north from Changzi and Tunliu. One route attacked southwest from Qin County, aiming to meet in Qinyuan. The Chinese army relied on the superior terrain, and fought back separately. After several days of fierce fighting, the Japanese were defeated. Another 2,000 Japanese troops who attacked east from Chencun, Jiang County, were intercepted by China in the Ren Village Zhang Shang Village area. The Japanese army, unable to support themselves, were defeated and returned to their original location. In addition, there have been fierce battles in Linfen, Hejin, Jiexian, Xiaxian, and other places recently. The Chinese army once approached the vicinity of Nanguan in Xiaxian County. Most of the Japanese highways and electric wires have been destroyed by China. The Japanese army that advanced towards Loba in southern Henan was severely attacked by China, with numerous casualties. The corpses transported to Wulidian totaled more than 700. On the night of the 30th of last month, the Chinese army in northern Henan launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army north of Qinyang, killing many Japanese soldiers. At noon on the 1st, the Japanese army in Qinyang launched a large-scale counterattack and was defeated again by China.</p>
<p>Guangdong and Guangxi</p>
<p>The Chinese army in southern Guangdong has continued to attack the Japanese army along the Guangzhou-Sanshui and Jiangmen-Foshan lines in recent days, inflicting heavy losses on them. A part of them also sneaked into Guangzhou City and attacked the Japanese Military Police Headquarters. The Japanese army in Guangzhou, Jiangmen, Foshan, and other places is now stepping up its guard. The Chinese army in eastern Guangdong once attacked Fengxi, Chao'an Prefecture, and recovered the Japanese-occupied strongholds of Changmei and Fengxi. The security captain took the opportunity to lead his troops to revolt and jointly kill the Japanese. The remaining Japanese troops besieged in Guinan and Zhenpuguan were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army on the 29th of last month, successively capturing Langanzha, Guanqian'ai, Molisha, and other places. The Japanese army in Zhennanguan could not support themselves and hurriedly fled to the Liangshan and Dongdeng areas across the border on the morning of the 30th. The pass was completely captured by the Chinese army. There are no traces of Japanese troops in Guangxi Province.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Huaian, Baoying, and other places advanced in separate routes on the 29th of last month. One route attacked south along the Yun River embankment from Huai to Wuhandong, and one route joined forces with the Japanese army in Baxianbu in Baoying to attack Panpa in the north. The Chinese army fought back separately, killing more than 300 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers were defeated and returned to their respective locations. The Japanese army under Dongsanwuxia in Gaoyou rode multiple motorboats and dragged wooden boats through Xiazhuang to disturb Ergou, but they were intercepted by the Chinese army, sinking three Japanese boats and several wooden boats, killing more than a hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese were unable to support themselves and fled back to Gaoyou. At the same time, a part of the Japanese army near Gaoyou attacked Dianwuduo and was also repelled by the Chinese army.

<h3>The Chinese Government Authorities Ordered the Closure of the Vietnamese Border. The Safety of Travelers Cannot Be Guaranteed. Malignant Malaria Is Now Epidemic in Hekou</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to official notices received by the foreign consulates today, the Chinese government authorities have ordered the closure of the Vietnamese border, prohibiting the passage of Chinese and foreign travelers. The stated reason is that the Chinese authorities cannot guarantee the safety of travelers on the 90-kilometer journey between the end of the current Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Vietnamese border. Two Frenchmen arrived in Kunming today and have returned due to this new order. Some travelers recently attempted to walk through the above-mentioned area where the railway was cut off, saying that the area has dense forests and many miasmas. Malignant malaria is now epidemic in Hekou, and many people have died, most of them within eight hours of onset. Recently, a foreign missionary died of malignant malaria while handling transportation matters for the Chengdu West China Union University in the area. His successor, Dr. Crawford, also suffered from the same disease and is quite serious. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>The Sino-British Military Alliance Theory Cannot Be Readily Believed</h3>
<p>London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that reports from the Japanese side that British Ambassador to China Kerr and Chairman Chiang are currently conducting negotiations in order to conclude a secret military alliance between China and Britain have not yet been confirmed here last night. However, London officials issued a warning, urging people not to easily believe the speculations and rumors currently circulating regarding the British ambassador's trip to Chongqing. The news from the Japanese side allegedly came from a reliable Chinese source in Shanghai. The alliance planned by China and Britain includes the UK actively rushing to transport munitions from India, Burma, and Singapore to Chongqing, and aircraft factories being established in India, Burma, and Singapore so that the latest aircraft can be transported to Chongqing. If war breaks out between Britain and Japan, Chiang Kai-shek's troops must be subject to the control of the commander-in-chief of the British forces in the Far East, etc. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities in Chongqing Have Not Fallen in Price</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The rice price in Chongqing has been falling continuously these days, which is very comforting to the people. However, the prices of other daily necessities have not fallen due to hoarding by merchants. The local newspapers have all commented on this. For example, the Central Daily News published an editorial, advocating that the government should control it to stabilize prices. The Saodang Daily stated that the people should organize groups to investigate the hoarding of merchants, and when necessary, they should also audit the accounts of financial institutions. If any fraudulent behavior is found, they should be reported to the government for severe punishment. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Comment on the Vietnam-Thailand Dispute, The Territorial Demands Should Be Strictly Rejected, France Should Take a Calm and Firm Attitude</h3>
<p>Lyon – Regarding the frequent disputes between French Vietnam and Thailand, "Le Temps" recently commented, advocating that France should adopt a calm and firm attitude and resolutely reject any territorial demands made by Thailand. The article stated, "If our country accepts any territorial demands made by Thailand, Thailand will definitely become insatiable and continue to make new demands, because Thailand's attempt is obviously to gradually establish a "Greater Thailand", thereby placing land that does not belong to the country and other races other than the Thai race within the country's territory. Moreover, judging from the demands made by Thailand, it can be seen that Thailand's intention is to take advantage of the current international situation to systematically sacrifice Vietnam for its own benefit. If foreign forces seem to be encouraging Thailand in secret, these foreign forces will invariably exhaust all methods to prevent the various colonies of the French Empire from being at peace and thereby undermine their unity. In addition, judging from the comments of Japanese newspapers, it can be seen that although Thailand is eager to seek support, it seems that it may not be able to achieve much in Japan and other countries in the Far East. In short, our country has always treated Thailand with a generous and friendly attitude. Now Thailand is actively carrying out anti-French propaganda. The reason for this is probably because the government is controlled by the 'Greater Thailand Movement'. However, our country has already taken a firm stand in both law and fact and should adopt a calm and firm attitude in the future." (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Thai Planes Bomb the Capital of Laos</p>
<p>Savannakhet – Four Thai planes dropped bombs on Vientiane, the capital of Laos, this afternoon. Earlier, a French aviator from a French air force base in Laos told a United Press reporter that they had encountered eight Thai planes in a recent incident on the Mekong River. The planes flew very well and were made abroad. Some experienced French aviators said that Thai aviators seemed to have sufficient flying experience. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Report of the American Reporter's Inspection</p>
<p>Although Thai planes scouted over Tachek this morning, the reporter felt that it was quite quiet here. The French army is still continuing to gradually turn this town on the Mekong River into a defensive position against aggression. Thai machine guns still occasionally fire at this place, and Thai searchlights also shone on the Mekong River between the Thai city of Nakhon Phanom and this town last night. A French officer showed the reporter the locations where Tachek was bombed, saying that Thailand is now using the latest American-made planes to bomb. Thai aviators also fired machine guns at villagers and threw bombs by hand. The reporter had previously visited the French military headquarters in Laos and learned that the only Thai-Vietnamese war news that the French officers there had heard was the border incident transmitted by radio. However, French officers said that the Thai army has excellent foreign equipment. The problem on the French side is how to make good use of their weapons. It was also heard that there were a large number of Thai troops stationed behind Nakhon Phanom. The French said that they believed they would be able to deal with the Thai invasion. They are now under orders not to fire a shot unless the situation is urgent. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Detain "Greek Merchant" Ship</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – The Japanese recently detained the ship "Greek Merchant", chartered by Panama, in Haikou, refusing to issue a permit to Hong Kong on the pretext of unproven nationality. The ship once encountered a disaster in Chinese waters and requested assistance. Finally, it was able to sail to Haikou with the assistance of another ship. The ship was previously owned by the Greek consul in Shanghai and is now chartered by a Hong Kong company to transport coal. The ship flies the Panamanian flag. The Panamanian consul in Hong Kong is currently negotiating to secure the release of the ship. (United Press dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>China and Greece</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the twentieth century, when the power of capitalist imperialism was expanding to its peak and some ancient civilizations were withering, some people compared the historical evolution of various nations to the life of an individual, from youth to old age. They concluded that some ancient civilizations, such as Egypt, Greece, India, Persia, and China, had embarked on an inevitable process of aging and were beyond remedy. The world thereafter would only be left to emerging nations to compete for hegemony. This view was not very different from the reality at the time, so it was very appealing in form, and the fate of these ancient civilizations seemed to have been predetermined by the Creator and impossible to escape. It wasn't until after the end of the First World War that the tide of nationalism swept the globe, and some ancient nations were no longer content with their destined fate and strived for ways to survive. Some small and weak nations that had fallen into semi-colonial and colonial status were struggling to compete with the emerging imperialist nations. This proved that the distinction between youth and old age was not necessarily reliable. However, the complete overturning of that theory was due to the examples provided by China and Greece, the oldest cultural nations in Asia and Europe, in their resistance to powerful enemies.</p>
<p>Looking closely at the current international situation, one must first acknowledge the great contributions of the Chinese and Greek nations in the war. Since 1931, the world order established after the previous World War has been fundamentally overturned: people are accustomed to laziness and complacency, and they sit idly by and watch the spread of invasion and poisoning. Thus, the wildfire broke out in Manchuria in an instant, and then spread to the Rhineland, collapsing the Kingdom of Abyssinia and destroying the Spanish Republic. The then powers, claiming to be first-class powers and responsible for maintaining international justice and security, were stunned and stood idly by without knowing what to do, so that the idea of conquering Asia and conquering the world was openly published in documents and newspapers, touting it as a basic national policy, making the safety and order of the whole world threatened again. If it were not for China's rise to fight and exchange heavy sacrifices for the effect of curbing aggression, it would not be difficult to imagine what the Far East would be like at this moment, and what impact it would have on the world. Furthermore, this summer, Nazi Germany launched a blitzkrieg, and in less than a month, Norway collapsed and France surrendered. Although Britain is still fighting alone and vows not to yield, it still feels overwhelmed and powerless to cope with the Axis powers' encirclement of the Middle East and Europe and their close collusion with Japan. If it were not for Greece's firm rejection of Italy's attempt to resist with all its strength, and defeating the powerful enemy for more than a month, almost shaking the Axis foothold on the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea, then not only would the situation in the eastern Mediterranean and the Near East become more dangerous, but also drastic changes would inevitably occur in the South Pacific, making the aggressors feel that they could do whatever they wanted without fear of punishment. Therefore, although it is still difficult to predict how the future of the international situation will evolve, in addition to the continued efforts and support of the Chinese and Greek nations, there is still a need for relevant powers to provide close support and actively respond. In the past, the great contributions of China and Greece's hard fighting have indeed established an indelible feat in modern history.</p>
<p>Comparing the Sino-Japanese War with the Greco-Italian War, the former has lasted for a long time and has consumed a large amount of the opponent's strength, while the latter has won quickly and has seriously frustrated the Axis offensive; although the forms are very different, in terms of contribution, they are the same. China and Greece have always been known as weak countries and have been subjected to long-term rule by foreign races in history. Their past politics have also gone through periods of chaos and civil war, but once they rise up to resist violent aggression, they can always unite the whole country against the enemy and unleash their potential, so that those who regard small and weak nations as easy to bully and think that aggression can be quickly successful, cannot but receive serious lessons, suffer heavy blows, and fall into a dilemma of advancing and retreating. This miracle is not seen in Denmark, the Netherlands, or even France, which is known as a first-class power, but only China and Greece can shine in modern history, which is enough to prove that these two nations are not only not aging, but are experiencing a vigorous and prosperous rebirth. The reason for this still needs to be sought in their long history. In general, a country with an ancient culture, especially when its past historical evolution has experienced a long period of stagnation, will inevitably accumulate some corrupt and evil dregs, hindering its proper evolution, and showing signs of decline and decay in appearance. On the other hand, the excellent cultural traditions of its nation must also have deep roots and a solid foundation; even if they exist only latently in the inner layers of the social structure, they will never die out due to multiple setbacks. And once there is a suitable opportunity and chance, it can be carried forward, just like plants and trees meet the spring sunshine, and the sick and weak get a blood transfusion. Today's China and Greece in the war against foreign aggression are exactly this kind of situation. Rather than thinking that this is unexpected, it is better to say that it is an inevitable cause and effect. In terms of the history of the Chinese and Greek nations, there have been many past events in which they fought hard and survived in the face of powerful enemies; the battles of Marathon and Plataea in ancient Greece, and the battles of Feishui and Cailishi in the Southern Jin and Southern Song dynasties were all examples of using the few to defeat the many and the weak to defeat the strong, which is enough to show their great talent and strong potential. Today's facts can be said to be a re-enactment of the glorious war history of ancient times, and they are even more magnificent and great. This is not national exaggeration, nor is it belittling any emerging countries and nations, but just based on reality to prove that ancient cultural nations are not necessarily aging. And those countries that lack a deep self-awareness and blindly act according to their own will, even if their national strength has only been prosperous not long ago, the fleeting prosperity has more examples in history, and it will be difficult to avoid the fate of immediate decline.</p>

<h3>Saturday Night; London Sky Is Calm; Many German Aircraft Bases Destroyed</h3>
<p>London - Britain has been subjected to air raids from 9 p.m. onwards, but yesterday at this time there was no report of German aircraft arriving in British airspace. This may be due to the weather in the occupied areas and the fact that the German aircraft bases were fiercely attacked by central aircraft on Friday night. At the same time, reports were received here on Friday of the strikes carried out by British bombers. That night, a large number of British bombers soared over the Orleans Plain to Holland, raiding various airfields, where explosions and fires occurred everywhere. Two British aircraft did not return, which shows the intensity of the bombing. The docks in Calais, Dunkirk, and Boulogne were all hit by bombs and exploded. One of the British aircraft that bombed an airfield in the Netherlands and Belgium was chased by an enemy aircraft, but it evaded skillfully and escaped after an hour. When the Royal Air Force carried out the above-mentioned attacks, the German aircraft's bombing activities were greatly reduced. No bombs fell on London on Friday night. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London - After the Royal Air Force carried out the largest attack on German bases since the start of the war, the skies over Britain were very calm last night.

It also bombed and destroyed the runways of 14 German airfields on the border between France and the Netherlands. It is generally believed that the reason for the sudden tranquility over the entire British Isles is partly due to this. Officials said that the British aircraft's air raid lasted from Friday night to Saturday, and large fires broke out everywhere that was bombed. (International News Service dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London - From dusk yesterday to 2:30 a.m. today, no German aircraft were seen flying over the British Isles. Many people speculated that the Royal Air Force had inflicted a fatal blow on the German Air Force, so that Hitler could not immediately launch a new offensive. On the other hand, according to sources here, British aircraft had successfully raided German territory and the seaports in the occupied areas. (International News Service dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London - There was no German aircraft activity over Britain last night, and the residents were able to sleep peacefully. This is really the first time since the start of the German air blitzkrieg.

<h3>Wounded British Ship Arrives in Uruguay; Has Entered Dock for Repairs</h3>
<p>Montevideo - The British merchant ship converted cruiser, the Carnarvon Castle, arrived here yesterday afternoon. The captain requested that the authorities allow the ship to remain in port for 48 hours for repairs. When the ship arrived, crowds gathered on the shore and cheered. The sailors on the ship also leaned on the railings and waved their hats in response. According to a brief communiqué, the ship engaged in battle with a German raider for ten minutes. The German ship tried to escape and refused to engage. The damage suffered by the Carnarvon Castle is visible on the surface and is easy to repair. However, the German ship must have suffered heavy damage and was overtaken and destroyed by the British battleship Warspite (31,100 tons). The Carnarvon Castle entered the dock at 5:00 p.m. and transported seven dead and ten injured ashore. According to Uruguayan officials who boarded the ship, they saw several holes in the hull, and several places were hit above the waterline, but the remaining reporters, including Ren Le, were not allowed to approach the ship's berth and stood on a pier 500 yards away to watch the ship's arrival. According to them, they could not see the signs of heavy damage on the ship. All the injured were flown to a British hospital for treatment. According to rumors, the British battleship Warspite is now sailing north, looking for the German ship. The intention of the Uruguayan naval authorities is that the German ship escaped safely, which is proven by the fact that the British cargo ships Argentine and Duchess, which were hiding in this port, sailed out in the afternoon.

<h3>American Newspapers Agree with Loans to China</h3>
<p>London - The American newspapers received here regarding the criticism of expanding loans to China expressed unanimous support. At the same time, comments from Swedish newspapers on the "treaty" signed by Japan and Wang were also received, proving that even the Swedish people, who are isolated in a remote corner of Europe, are not deceived by the "treaty" signed by Japan and Wang. The Stockholm Times explained the "treaty" signed by Japan and Wang, saying that this means that the Sino-Japanese War does not have the hope of ending earlier due to the signing of this treaty. This treaty is only a gesture of Japan imitating the Axis powers. The Chinese government feels that it is sufficient to continue the war to the end since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road and the increased aid to China from the United States and the Soviet Union. All the information obtained here says that the Sino-Japanese War is not easy to end. The Gothenburg Times also said that after the "treaty" was signed in Japan, the hope of peace is even more slim. A paper treaty can never end the war, and the Soviet Union does not like this treaty. For the sake of the Soviet Union's interests, it must not allow Japan to dominate China. The authoritative weekly "The Economist", which studies finance and finance in London, published a commentary saying that the preliminary negotiations for the treaty took almost a year, and there was a delay of five months after the "treaty" was signed, which is incomprehensible. In order to reduce the harshness of the conditions, a year of negotiations was really necessary, but even after a year of negotiations, the conditions are still rare and outrageous. The conclusion is that if Japan obtains the fact of free trade in any region of China, the special rights of the concessions are no longer necessary, because (the entire China has become Japan's vast concession). The Chinese government believes that this treaty is Japan's attempt to ridicule itself in a state of boredom when the war of aggression has entered the fourth year and the war situation has not progressed. Moreover, the fact that all countries in the world do not attach importance to this "treaty" can further inspire the morale of the Chinese people. The timely lending of the United States is an expression of trust in the Chinese government. All countries that pay attention to the situation in the Far East have a very deep impression of China's invincibility, and not only the Soviet Union. The London News Chronicle in its newspaper on the 6th specifically stated that the Soviet Union will treat Japan coldly and aid China. The headline of the Communist Party's Daily Worker also stated (the Soviet Union told Japan that its policy towards China will not change), and published the statement of the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Smetanin, to the Japanese Foreign Minister, saying that although Japan signed a treaty with Wang Jingwei, the Soviet Union's policy towards China will not change, and the Soviet government does not regard the anti-communist item in Article of the Japanese-Wang Treaty as its target, and it does not affect Japan's desire to adjust its relations with the Soviet Union. The newspaper also reprinted detailed statistics on the military victories achieved by China from the Soviet Red Star newspaper. The Moscow radio news received in London is also particularly rich in news of Chinese victories and the Chinese government's efforts to improve the people's living conditions. (Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Aviation Memorial Donation is Considerable</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Chen Qingyun, a veteran of the Air Force, went to the United States to raise aviation memorial donations, and has now returned to Hong Kong on the 5th. According to his report, overseas Chinese in various parts of the Americas contributed more than 6.3 million US dollars, and overseas Chinese in the Philippines also donated 1 million pesos.

<h3>Hunan Province Promotes Upland Cotton Planting</h3>
<p>Leiyang - The cotton-producing areas of Hunan Province were originally limited to the counties along the lake. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the yarn mills have expanded, and the cotton source is insufficient. In order to increase cotton production, the authorities have specially promoted upland cotton planting and worked hard to promote cotton planting in the southwestern counties of Hunan Province. A large number of technicians have been sent to lend high-quality seeds. (Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Estimated Direct Tax Revenue for Next Year</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The government hopes that direct tax revenues such as income tax, profit tax, stamp tax, and inheritance tax can reach 135 million yuan next year, and land tax can reach at least 200 million yuan. From the beginning of this year to November 18, income tax revenue was 43.9 million yuan, profit tax revenue was 37 million yuan, stamp tax revenue was 4.7 million yuan, and inheritance tax was levied on July 1, with a revenue of 2,700 yuan. Part of the land tax this year can be paid in agricultural products for the government to set up military and civilian granaries. An order has now been issued to all provinces to levy land tax from January 1 next year. (Reuters dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>Hellenic Army Continues Northward Advance: Occupies Key Town of Telvino; Italian Army Fights Rearguard Action to Cover Retreat</h3>
<p>Athens, News was released here last night in an official Greek communique, stating that Telvino town, on the highway south of Albania leading from Argyrokastro to Santi Quaranta harbor, has been occupied by Greek forces. A Reuters correspondent, filing from the Greek-Albanian border, reports that Italian forces are currently engaged in rearguard actions, covering their retreat. Yesterday, Italian forces desperately attempted to prevent the Greek army from advancing along the Skumbi River towards Këlcyrë, as the Greek army's capture of Këlcyrë would sever the only road connecting Italian forces to Elbasan. Heavy fighting is ongoing in multiple locations along this northern front. The village of Gotkocë, southwest of Pogradec, saw relentless combat throughout yesterday, with Italian forces exerting all their strength to halt the Greek advance. Greek forces northeast of Pogradec have advanced along the shore of Lake Ohrid towards the village of Udënisht, intending to flank the Italian army and protect the defensive line leading to Elbasan. On Friday in this area, elite Greek infantry engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with Italian forces in the mountains, resulting in the capture of over six hundred Italian soldiers, including an infantry colonel. Fierce fighting has also erupted in the region of Moscopole, with the Greek army seizing a mountain southwest of the town in a decisive victory, and advancing directly towards Orshuvë. They also captured a height near the village of Drenovë, previously held by an Italian artillery battery. It is reported that a total of three hundred Italian soldiers were captured along various fronts yesterday. The British Royal Air Force headquarters in Greece announced last night that British aircraft attacked Valona on Friday, with one bomb striking an ammunition depot, causing a large plume of black smoke. Vehicle parks and military buildings were also hit and exploded. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Athens, The Greek High Command announced today that Greek forces, having crossed Santi Quaranta, have pushed forward and occupied Telvino, a key road junction in Albania, last night. It is reported that since the capture of Santi Quaranta on Friday, the Greek army has advanced northward with irresistible momentum in two directions, and occupied Telvino last night. The distance to Argyrokastro, abandoned by Italian forces, is now less than half. Further west, another column of Greek troops has advanced along the coastal road to Chimara, complementing the overall advance of the Greek forces in Lower Albania. The rapid advance of the Greek forces in Lower Albania aims to prevent the retreating Italian army from establishing a new line of defense stretching from the Adriatic Sea to the Vjosë River. At the same time, it is reported that victorious Greek forces in the snow-covered mountains west of Logara, chanting "Christmas in Tirana", charged with bayonets and hand grenades yesterday in fierce hand-to-hand combat, capturing several villages. These villages all control fortified high ground. One Greek column advanced from the side to the shores of Lake Ohrid, while another column advanced to the south bank of the Shkumbin River, threatening the town of Kukës, a crucial point on the main road to Elbasan. British and Greek aircraft are intensifying their pursuit of the retreating Italian forces relentlessly, chasing them directly to their base. The Greek side stated today that British bombers destroyed a large Italian ammunition depot in Valona, and that several hundred more Italian soldiers were captured, including many officers. It is also reported that a major fire has engulfed the entire city of Argyrokastro, its fate entirely in the hands of the Greek army. Moments later, a Greek report confirmed that reports of bloody unrest in Milan, Trieste, and Florence have been fully verified. (International Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Athens, A dispatch from a former Reuters correspondent states that Italian forces along the southern front, from Santi Quaranta to Premeti, are continuing to retreat, abandoning large quantities of military supplies. It is reported that the town of Telvino, located on the road from Argyrokastro to Santi Quaranta, has also been captured by Greek forces. On the front slightly further north, Greek forces, after encountering fierce resistance, captured several important high grounds with bayonet charges. Italian forces are currently attempting to reinforce their troops in order to halt the Greek advance along the Skumbi River towards Këlcyrë, as the Greek army's capture of Këlcyrë would sever the only road connecting Italian forces to Elbasan. The Jewish community of Athens has sent a letter to Greek Prime Minister General Metaxas, expressing their gratitude for his determination to fight for the freedom of Greece and its religious principles, and appealing to the world, especially the United States, for aid to Greece. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Rome, The Italian High Command announced that an enemy attack on the left flank of the Italian Ninth Army on the Greek front has been repelled. Only reconnaissance activities have occurred in other sectors. Italian aircraft bombed military targets in Preveza and Ithaca. Enemy aircraft attacked Valona, but were intercepted by anti-aircraft fire and fighter planes. Naval anti-aircraft batteries shot down one enemy aircraft, and fighter planes also shot down one enemy aircraft. Two other enemy aircraft were also hit by Italian aircraft and were seen to catch fire, escaping into the clouds. In North Africa, Italian aircraft carried out low-level strafing runs against enemy transport vehicles east of Bir Hakeim, destroying several. One Italian aircraft bombed military targets near Mersa Matruh at Raml. In East Africa, Italian air groups attacked transport vehicles, highway stations, and airfields. All Italian aircraft returned safely. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Greek Forces Continue Offensive: Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat with Italian Army</p>
<p>Albanian Greek Army Headquarters: In the past twenty-four hours, Greek forces in the Pogradec sector have continued their offensive, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Italian forces. They have secured a foothold in the area of the Dajti Mountain to the west, from which they can advance towards the Elbasan oil fields. A reporter witnessed the fighting between the two armies from a mountain peak. Both sides employed intense artillery fire. The shells fired by the Italian forces were clearly visible in the air, and the massive explosions reverberated throughout the Lake Ohrid region. The area is littered with Italian supplies abandoned by the retreating forces. The weather was clear yesterday, ideal for air operations, but the reporter did not see a single Italian aircraft during a five-hour inspection of the front lines. Five Greek reserve units and supply columns, like a long snake, fearlessly charged towards the shores of Lake Ohrid, undeterred by the rain of machine gun, mortar, and artillery fire from the Italian forces.

<p>Greek Army Pursues on Three Fronts: Aims to Cut Off Italian Retreat Route</p>
<p>Southern Capital: According to news received here from the Italian-Greek front, heavy fog shrouded the northern battlefield yesterday, halting all combat operations. However, according to reports from Greece, the Greek army continues to make progress. The Greek army is advancing along three fronts: one to the north of Pogradec, advancing along the shores of Lake Ohrid; the second to the southwest of Pogradec, along the Skumbi River valley; and the third to the southwest of Moscopole, along the banks of the Devoll River. The Greek army intends to cut off the Italian army's retreat route to Elbasan. Italian forces are putting up fierce resistance. Due to the adverse weather conditions, few air battles occurred. It is reported that large numbers of Italian reinforcements have arrived at the battlefield, gradually halting the rapid advance of the Greek army. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Italian Army Launches Five Counterattacks: Blocks Greek Offensive</p>
<p>Southern Capital: Today's report from Lake Ohrid states that Italian artillery fire has halted the Greek advance. Italian forces are firmly holding positions on Mount Kamja and Mount Mallke, cutting off the Greek advance towards Elbasan. Near Moscopole, Italian forces launched five counterattacks yesterday, attacking Greek forces in the Devoll valley. After fierce fighting, they were finally repelled. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Greek Army in Albania Obtains: Important Italian Documents</p>
<p>Athens, Documents obtained by the Greek army upon entering Albanian territory have proven Italy's premeditated intention to invade Greece. Today, a Greek government spokesperson presented photographs of these documents to newspaper reporters. These include orders to annihilate Greek border guards by surprise, and a notification issued to the Ferrara Division on October 26, stating: "Our current objective is Epirus. The time has come, and we must prevail." (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Italian Government Replaces: Chief of Naval Staff; Establishes Deputy Chief of Staff; Rumors of Revolts in Three Italian Cities</h3>
<p>Rome, Italian Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Cavagnari resigned today. Admiral Riccardi has been appointed as the new Chief of Naval Staff, Admiral Campioni as the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, and Admiral Iachino as the Commander-in-Chief of the Fleet. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>New York, It is heard here that the British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast that riots have broken out in Fiume and Trieste, but did not provide further details. (United Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington, The U.S. government has received confidential reports from Italy stating that public sentiment within Mussolini's regime is uneasy and the situation is quite serious, particularly in the northern heartland. The International News Service learned yesterday that members of the U.S. Embassy in Italy have sent unredacted, comprehensive reports in recent days, detailing Italian citizens' reactions to strict rationing, excessive taxation, and military setbacks. A senior government official told reporters that these reports should be taken seriously. People sympathetic to the United States hope that a revolution against the Fascist regime will occur soon, or that the Italian-German axis will break apart at the southern end. Although the available reports do not allow for a definitive prediction of this outcome, new information suggests that "the internal situation in Italy has reached an extremely serious stage, and it is possible that events will unfold." (International Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Rome, Italy newly established a Deputy Chief of Staff yesterday, whose candidate is also undetermined. This person's role is to assist the Chief of Staff and act as his replacement when he is absent. Hereafter, the General Staff will have a general from each of the army, navy, and air force. (Haitong Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Athens, Yesterday the Greek forces made rapid advances in both the northwest and the west, seeking to prevent the Italian army from building new defensive lines. While the Greek army was advancing, there was news from the Greek side that bloody rebellions broke out in at least three major Italian cities. It is rumored that Milan, Florence, and Trieste have experienced serious rebellions verging on large-scale riots. It is reported that on Friday, Blackshirts fired upon civilians in Trieste, resulting in the deaths of several and injuries to many more. (International Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London, A Reuters military commentator says that the resignation or dismissal of Italian Chief of the General Staff, General Badoglio, is an extremely important matter. The full significance of this event cannot be assessed until we know for certain whether it was a resignation or a dismissal. In any case, it is a sign of the greatest difficulty in Mussolini's political career. If Badoglio was forced to resign by Mussolini, the resulting chaos and lack of trust are readily apparent. Is Mussolini perhaps aware that the situation is so serious that he has to take special measures in the hope of saving the Italian forces in Albania from destruction and restoring the fascist prestige shattered by the Greek army? Does Mussolini perhaps hope that replacing people can reverse the dangerous situation? But is this the real reason for Badoglio's resignation? I do not think so. Because the situation for the Italian army is certainly precarious, replacing military leaders will only cause panic among the Italian people. Now, the person replacing Badoglio is an unknown person in the military, one with rich experience in commanding the army, a politician rather than a military man. From this perspective, Badoglio's dismissal does not seem to have come from Mussolini's coercion. Then did Badoglio resign voluntarily? If this is the case, then the meaning is important. Badoglio is a soldier, with a reputation for integrity and honor. He would never abandon his troops in a military emergency. But if he is dissatisfied with the Fascist regime and opposes Fascist policies, then this is a different matter altogether. Is Badoglio involved in the crisis caused by Fascism? Badoglio is aware that the current trend is increasingly unfavorable to Italy, and knows that those who oppose Fascism should rise up in a timely manner to respond to the appeals of the people and restore the country to constitutional order and give the Italians their freedom? This is not known for certain as Badoglio's true intentions. Only a sustained attack on a weak and exhausted Italy can bring about this change. At this time, Britain should not only be guided by sound military considerations in its actions, but also comprehensively consider political theories and the psychology of battlefield soldiers and the Italian people to determine a timely and vigorous strategy. Since ancient times, all major wars have relied on courage and a spirit of adventure as one of the most reliable methods of victory. Now this day has arrived. British and Greek forces have already engaged in small-scale joint operations. If the British and Greek fleets were to jointly attack Valona in coordination with the Greek army on land, the Italian forces in Albania would suffer a fatal blow. As for Libya, the British army only needs to defeat the Italian forces at Sidi Barrani and drive them out of Egyptian territory, without having to penetrate deep into Libya along the only water-supplied road. This is enough to have a major military and political impact on Germany, Italy, and Japan. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Gasoline: Exported to Italy; State Control of Foreign Oil Companies</h3>
<p>Rome, The Italian official news agency recently received a dispatch from Bucharest stating that the Romanian government has approved the export of a certain amount of aviation gasoline to Italy in exchange for Italian lead production. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Bucharest, The Romanian government issued an order on December 4 to seize the assets of all foreign oil companies in the country. It is now estimated that the Romanian government will pay a sum of US$7.5 million for all pipelines, pumping stations, oil storage tanks, and other equipment that should be received by the government.

<h3>French Government Plans: Occupational Guild System</h3>
<p>Vichy, Labor and Industrial Production Minister Pétain reported to the Council of State yesterday on his proposed "New Organization of Industry and Professions" plan. Its content imitates the occupational guild system of the Middle Ages. All occupations are generally controlled by the state. In the event of disputes between labor and capital, the state will also mediate. According to him, this plan only lays the foundation for the future organization of French industry and occupations, and may not be able to solve it at present, because it cannot be implemented until the French social organization is completely reorganized. Even if the country wants to adopt a professional group system, it will not be successful without several years of preparation. Therefore, if our country wants to establish a perfect occupational guild system, it must first establish new moral standards and formulate a new constitution. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Vichy, Political observers here recently stated that the government's reorganization of the national industry in accordance with the principles of "cooperation" will encounter some difficulties, and therefore will require adjustments in the next few years. However, it is easier to start when reorganizing agricultural institutions. Therefore, the government's laws on reorganizing agricultural institutions are expected to achieve concrete results. It is estimated that there are 30 million people in the country engaged in agriculture, and in the future they will all be subject to the current government's "National Rural Professional Group Organization Law." This law is a major achievement of the current government, and its main purpose is to instill the principles of cooperation into various rural areas. At the same time, those who drafted this law also referred to foreign experience, so as to adopt its strengths to adapt to the personality and temperament of the French nation, and stipulate that occupational groups of a cooperative nature should be organized based on the common interests of all classes, in order to eliminate class struggle. In addition, French rural areas are dominated by small self-cultivating farmers, and the number of hired workers is less than that of landlords, so organizing this occupational group is relatively easy. However, this law cannot be implemented immediately at present. The government plans to first appoint 30 commissioners to form a special committee to be responsible for handling the reorganization of national agriculture in preparation for the implementation of this law. (Havas Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister: To Visit Greece</h3>
<p>London, According to news reported by the Southern Slavic capital newspaper, Turkish Foreign Minister Dr. Saracoglu will visit Greece soon, meeting Greek Prime Minister Metaxas in Thessaloniki to discuss the issue of an Italian-Greek armistice. Although this statement has not been officially confirmed, it is widely rumored that the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, has already made this suggestion to the Turkish Foreign Minister. The suggestion is that Greece can achieve peace after rejecting British protection, and then Greece should join Hitler's New Order, with Germany guaranteeing its security, with the nature being similar to the recent example of Romania. However, there are currently no signs as to whether the Greek Prime Minister, Metaxas, will accept this suggestion. The motivation behind von Papen's peace initiative is largely due to Italy's defeat and Germany's urgent need for various Greek products, such as chromium, fruit, and raisins. Turkish people in London believe that Greece will continue to resist, and that Britain is providing Greece with the greatest possible military assistance. The scale and scope of this assistance are extremely impressive to the Turkish people. (United Press, 8th)</p>

<h3>Hitler Demands of France: Price for Permanent Peace: Annexation of Alsace-Lorraine: Use of the Remaining French Fleet</h3>
<p>Southern Capital: According to reliable information obtained here, Hitler will propose to Vichy Foreign Minister Laval that Germany annex Alsace-Lorraine and use the French fleet as the price for France to make peace. When Laval visits Berlin in the future, it is believed that the German side will ask him to approve an agreement stipulating that the territory France is to cede is limited to Alsace-Lorraine. As for the Italian side, it will make no demands, and French colonies, including Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia, which were the clear reasons for Italy's participation in the war, will remain intact. Hitler will also promise Laval to withdraw German troops from French territory, except for the Channel ports, as Germany will continue to attack England. Although German troops will not withdraw from the Channel ports, local administrative power will belong to the French side. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Basel, A Berlin dispatch in a local newspaper said that the development of the German diplomatic offensive must be sought in Southeast Europe. Vichy Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval's visit to Berlin will not materialize, so there may not be any developments on the French side. According to sources in Berlin responsible, the purpose of the visit of the Hungarian Foreign Minister Czaky to the south is to improve relations between Germany and Yugoslavia and between Hungary and Yugoslavia. If Hungary and Yugoslavia both agree to abide by the "European New Order," then the last opposing elements can be expected to be eliminated, and Yugoslavia can be recruited into the Tripartite Pact. It is understood that the German Foreign Office has contacted Switzerland and Sweden to discuss the possibility of joining the Tripartite Pact or recognizing Germany's leading position in the "European New Order."

<h3>Bulgarian-Turkish Relations: Have Not Yet Been Clarified</h3>
<p>Sofia, Regarding the Bulgarian envoy to Turkey, Kiroff, returning home to report on the current situation, British newspapers have claimed that Bulgaria and Turkey will jointly seek improvement in politics and economics, which well-informed sources here believe to be an exaggeration. People in Sofia also believe that the understanding between Bulgaria and Turkey can stop defensive measures and pacify the Balkan situation, but so far Turkey has not taken the steps indicated by the Bulgarian newspapers, so it is not yet possible to talk about Bulgarian-Turkish collaboration. It is expected that the intention of spreading this news is to make the Axis countries suspect Bulgaria's attitude. Regarding the relationship between Bulgaria and Turkey, Turkey previously proposed expanding commercial affairs to Sofia, and Turkey sent a commercial delegation to Sofia and added a commercial office to the Turkish embassy in Bulgaria, but this plan, due to the inability of the commercial staff to expand it, has not yet been clarified, so it has not yet been implemented.

<p>A Painful History of the European War (V)</p>
<h3>A Memoir of the Last Days of Warsaw</h3>
<p>The fall of Warsaw, the capital of Poland, is truly the most tragic page in the history of this decisive European war. This translated article is taken from the book "Siege" by Julien Oryan, a well-known American photojournalist. It was delayed and is only now being published due to the backlog of other translated manuscripts:</p>
<p>At 1:00 AM on September 7, 1939, I and others boarded the last train into Warsaw and arrived at the station in complete darkness. After leaving the train, we tried to find a taxi but couldn't, as they had all been requisitioned for military use. Fortunately, we found a horse-drawn carriage and rode with several friends directly to the Europa Hotel.</p>
<p>I initially thought the hotel would be crowded with journalists, but it was mostly empty. I chose a large room with a bathroom and asked about the rent. The receptionist shrugged and stated the price, but seemed not to care about the money. In fact, I never paid that rent.</p>
<p>The next morning, I learned that the Polish government had already moved out of Warsaw, and all journalists, photojournalists, and newsreel cameramen had also left. It seemed I had no way to get out. However, the ideal of a photographer was realized at this time. I was in the most tragically besieged city in modern history, and I could capture the various stages of the siege of Warsaw on film without worrying about competition from other photographers.</p>
<p>Soon after, I also learned that Mayor Starzyński had decided to lead the civilians in a desperate defense of Warsaw, truly a hero in a besieged city. As long as the Polish people exist, the name of Starzyński will surely be a source of pride, and patriotic feelings will surely arise spontaneously. I applied to Mr. Starzyński for a photography permit. He received me kindly and replied in a calm tone, "We must stay here, but you must eventually take the photos out of the city, so the world can know what happened here." (Note: Starzyński has since been executed.)</p>
<p>Thereafter, during my terrifying time in Warsaw, I never saw Mr. Starzyński lose his composure. On one occasion, while I was in his office, two bombs fell thirty yards away, shaking the building like an earthquake. Afterwards, all was silent, as if dead. Mr. Starzyński, in this situation, only told me not to stand by the window to avoid danger. However, he himself stayed in the bombed building for two weeks, never leaving. Mr. Starzyński broadcast daily, encouraging the people with brave words, saying that although the government had moved elsewhere, the people still had leaders to command them.</p>
<p>Mr. Starzyński provided a car and a guide and interpreter for my use. First, we went to a large Catholic hospital that had been bombed. The hospital had been hit by five bombs, each creating craters 30 to 35 feet in diameter. The hospital was in extreme disarray. The western end of the building had been destroyed. Fortunately, the parts that were not destroyed still had many windows shattered, and the beds were covered with ointment. In the surgery room, the overhead reflector was teetering, and the operating table was also covered in scattered ointment.</p>
<p>On another day, a newly built six-story building was also hit by a bomb. When I arrived, I saw the bodies of fourteen women and children, their flesh and blood a mess, lying stiffly on the ground. A young woman had been bombed, her head and feet incomplete. It was truly heartbreaking and shocking to see, and the sight was terrifying.</p>
<p>The desperate defense of Warsaw was quite moving. I inspected the cellar of a maternity hospital, where there were fifty young women suffering the pain of bombing and shelling. Some had just given birth, and their infants had been hit by stray bullets or shards of glass. However, these young women, no matter how severe the pain, all had the strength to endure it.</p>
<p>One day, we drove through the fields outside the city. We were slightly delayed and did not witness a tragedy, but we learned that seven women were digging potatoes in a field to fill their stomachs when two German planes suddenly flew over and dropped a bomb on a small hut two hundred yards away, killing two women inside. The women digging potatoes all lay prone on the ground, hoping the German planes would fly over and not notice them. But the German pilots were not satisfied. They flew back a moment later and opened fire on the field with machine guns, killing two of the seven women.</p>
<p>As I was photographing the corpses, a little girl ran over and stood beside the body of a woman, her sister. The girl stood there for a moment, then burst into tears, crying, "Sister! What happened to you? Tell me! Who will I rely on without you?"</p>
<p>The girl then looked up at us with a bewildered expression. I embraced her tightly, wanting to comfort her. The girl burst into tears again. I and the two Polish military officers with me couldn't help but have tears welling up in our eyes. What words could we use to comfort the girl? Later, I spoke with many farmers, refugees, and even American expatriates who had been shot at by German planes flying less than a hundred feet above. I became convinced that the Germans were deliberately harming civilians.</p>
<p>While taking photographs, I saw an old woman standing in front of a pile of rubble, where her destroyed apartment building had been. In the rubble, a stove remained, the fire extinguished, but a teapot on the stove, still boiling, was hissing. The embers in the rubble had not been extinguished and were still smoldering. A few feet away was an iron bed, only the frame remaining. The old woman aimlessly poked at the rubble with her cane, searching, but what she was looking for, I fear even she herself did not know. Another old woman, over seventy years old, stood woodenly, her apartment completely destroyed, carrying out two silver spoons and a pair of scissors, and nothing else. Nearby, a child, about seven years old, was playing kickball. In another courtyard, scorched by fire, still smoldering, several families gathered, checking the few remaining belongings, only a statue of the Virgin Mary, a pot of vegetables, and bedding.

<h3>Authorities Convene Meeting to Thoroughly Stabilize Rice Prices: Meeting to be Held This Afternoon at the Municipal Council to Re-Determine Price Limits and Profits; Rice Merchants Requested to Release Stored Rice for Sale</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchants Guild, in response to the soaring rice prices which have had a significant impact, issued an emergency notice on the 4th of this month, limiting rice prices to no more than the prices of the 2nd of this month. Recently, rice prices have shown improvement, and the cost of ordering foreign rice has decreased. Rice prices could have gradually fallen, but due to speculation and manipulation, market prices have soared abnormally. Domestic rice has reached as high as 108 yuan per picul, and Siamese rice has also been raised to 89 yuan. It is becoming increasingly difficult for ordinary people to make a living. If a thorough solution is not quickly found, the future is unimaginable. Both concession authorities are concerned about this and have decided to invite leaders of various rice merchant guilds to the Municipal Council meeting room at 2:00 PM this afternoon to discuss stabilization measures.</p>
<p>Re-Determining Price Limits and Profits</p>
<p>Today's meeting is very important. In addition to deciding to investigate centralized storage levels, price limits per bag and allowable profits will be re-determined, and measures will be implemented swiftly and strictly to achieve the goal of suppressing rice prices. At the same time, the suggestion of raising 15 million yuan to store 200,000 bags of foreign rice in public warehouses for public sale will also be discussed. As for what the price limit per bag of 222 catties will be set at, it is said that some are advocating for 80 yuan for each bag of Yangon rice, with the Rice Merchants Guild previously setting the follow price at 96 yuan. It is rumored that today's meeting may set it at 90+ yuan. If that is the case, then the price per picul would be 70+ yuan. It is greatly hoped that everyone attending can put the people's food first and consider this carefully. As for the export of No. 1 tribute rice, it is said that the ban may be lifted in February. During this period, the rice stored in Shanghai is more than sufficient, so there is no need to panic. Furthermore, the method of public warehousing and public sale can be implemented when the new rice comes on the market.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Request Sale of Warehouse Rice</p>
<p>The authorities say: "To whom it may concern, the rice shops of our guild are engaged in the retail sale of rice and grain, and are similar in nature to other businesses. We are definitely not speculators. We purchase and sell daily, and we always welcome customers. We definitely do not hoard and refuse to sell. We buy high, sell high, buy low, sell low, and our prices are transparent. We definitely do not engage in speculation to seek illicit profits. Our costs are high, and turnover is difficult. We definitely do not have the huge capital to monopolize the market. Our members are scattered throughout the city, with a large number of businesses and intense competition. We are definitely not a small number of three or five companies that can manipulate the market. When our members purchase goods, it is like customers buying rice from a store. It is rare to buy high, and we definitely have no intention of raising prices.</p>
<p>No Intention of Raising Prices</p>
<p>The above six points are all well-known facts. The general public, although aware of this, often does not understand the underlying reasons and often misunderstands and criticizes us, leading to resentment. We suffer unwarranted blame. Although this is a small matter for individuals, it is a major matter for social stability and public order. Therefore, we must make a clear statement. In this extraordinary period, prices are high for everything, and rice prices in particular are rising without end. The people's livelihood is extremely difficult. The market is chaotic, and dangerous signs are emerging. Those who have goods are still hoarding them and refusing to sell, seeking huge profits. What else is this but hoarding and speculation? If strict measures are not taken to deal with this, the food supply for the citizens will be unimaginable. The situation is urgent, so we are submitting this truthful report to your office, hoping that you will consider rice and grain to be important for the people's livelihood and security. Please immediately investigate the exact amount of rice and grain currently stored in each warehouse, order each storer to produce samples, and sell them immediately at cost plus a legal profit in order to stabilize market prices and maintain the food supply for the people."</p>
<p>General Opinions on Grain Storage Issues</p>
<p>Previously, Mr. Yu Qiaqing proposed ordering 200,000 bags of foreign rice to be stored in this city to suppress rice prices. Rice industry groups should be responsible for 100,000 bags. In addition to the 60,000 bags already subscribed for by the miscellaneous grain and bean rice industries, the remaining 40,000 bags can also be subscribed for separately. In addition to the 100,000 bags, the silver money industry has agreed to order and store 50,000 bags of grain, and the shortfall will be borne by other powerful groups. However, according to the general opinion of the people, since this rice and grain is intended to stabilize the rice price in this city, we should publicize the cost and sale price fairly and sell it at a fair price when necessary. Furthermore, the rice industry's request for free trade should be carefully studied.</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting the Release of No. 1 Tribute Rice</p>
<p>The French Vietnamese authorities' prohibition on the export of No. 1 Saigon rice has obstructed the delivery of 85,000 bags of orders placed by rice merchants in this city, affecting the local rice market. In addition to submitting a letter to the French Consul General in this city to forward a telegram to the French Vietnamese authorities requesting release, the Bean Rice Guild also plans to telegram the Vietnamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce for negotiation. According to a certain rice industry figure, even if the ordered grain is not released and shipped to Shanghai at present, it should be possible to ship to Shanghai as usual when the new Saigon grain comes to market next spring. Furthermore, the demand for No. 1 tribute rice is not strong and does not affect the overall market.</p>
<p>Rice Market System Urgently Needs Reform</p>
<p>According to a person familiar with the rice market yesterday, the current rice market has lost its normal trading functions. It cannot be stabilized without thorough reform, but this cannot be achieved with a single document or resolution. Strict restrictions must be placed on rice merchants entering the market. Unless the methods of the miscellaneous grain industry are followed, allowing only licensed dealers and rice merchants to enter the market, all others should be prohibited. This will normalize the operations of dealers, brokerages, and exchanges, and stabilize the rice market.</p>
<h3>Seeking Permanent Solutions to the Hardships of Chinese Constables: Yu Qiaqing Urges All Industries to Contribute to a Fund to Enthusiastically Assist with the Welfare of Chinese Constables</h3>
<p>Due to high prices and difficult living conditions, Chinese constables in the Public Concession have made requests to the authorities to improve their treatment and have at one point expressed their attitude. After Mr. Yu Qiaqing's efforts, a temporary solution was reached, and the authorities, understanding the suffering of the Chinese constables, announced an increase in living allowances the night before last, bringing the matter to a close. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Mr. Yu Qiaqing yesterday to inquire about the process and was given the following statement:</p>
<p>The Attitude of the Chinese Constables is Commendable</p>
<p>The request of the Chinese constables in the Public Concession to improve their treatment this time was due to the difficulty of their living conditions. I believe that it is reasonable in principle, so I took the initiative to mediate. However, the responsibility of the police officers to maintain law and order is that of public servants of society and is of course different from other jobs. The attitude of the Chinese constables this time is commendable, and the Municipal Council is very understanding of their suffering. After multiple studies and discussions, and under the difficult economic circumstances of the Municipal Council, the living allowances for Chinese constables and other staff have been increased. The fairness and consideration shown to all staff is admirable.</p>
<p>Permanent Assistance Measures Should Be Considered</p>
<p>However, during this period of high living costs, although the increased allowances will allow the Chinese constables to barely maintain their daily lives and avoid freezing and starvation, they will still have no recourse in the event of unforeseen circumstances such as funeral expenses and other special expenses. Furthermore, if they could obtain rice and flour at affordable prices, they could serve the society with greater peace of mind. Therefore, I express my sympathy for the fundraising effort to find a way to help the Chinese constables solve their problems. The Municipal Council's finances depend on various taxes, and are already insufficient to meet the budget. If other expenses were to be added, the burden on the citizens would be increased, which is clear to all.</p>
<p>Sympathy, Cooperation, and Joint Subscription to a Fund</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that all Chinese constables will always keep in mind the importance of their responsibilities, work diligently, and be more cautious. At the same time, I urge all sectors of society to show sympathy and mutual assistance and to enthusiastically subscribe to a fund to support the welfare of the Chinese constables, reduce the burden on the Municipal Council, and reduce the burden on the general public. Guaranteeing that the Chinese constables can serve with peace of mind is also guaranteeing that all sectors can develop together.</p>
<p>Affordable Supply of Rice and Flour</p>
<p>As for the affordable supply of rice and flour, this will also be considered within the realm of possibility. We will work with the Price Stabilization Committee and the flour mill trade association to find ways to implement this. Finally, Mr. Yu stated that he was very pleased that the directors and staff of the Municipal Council, both Chinese and foreign, had strongly supported this mediation effort, and that Chief Inspector Bao and Deputy Chief Inspector Yao had managed it well, and that the Chinese constables had maintained a proper attitude.</p>

<h3>House Tax Revenue Doubles After Implementation of Increased Surtax: Revenue Increases by More Than Double for Both Western and Chinese Style Houses: Municipal Council Announces Autumn House Tax Statistics</h3>

According to the Municipal Council's published statistics for the autumn house tax (the first quarter after the increase): A. Western-style houses: Central District: 1,489,624 yuan, compared to 787,929 yuan in the same quarter last year. Northern District: 290,851 yuan, compared to 138,612 yuan in the same quarter last year. Eastern District: 532,128 yuan, compared to 287,477 yuan in the same quarter last year. Western District: 945,107 yuan, compared to 480,298 yuan in the same quarter last year. Outer Road Area: 417,343 yuan, compared to 25,155 yuan in the same quarter last year. Total: 3,675,143 yuan, compared to 1,909,471 yuan in the same quarter last year. B. Chinese-style houses: Central District: 613,91+ yuan, compared to 152,609 yuan in the same quarter last year.

Total: 2,244,064 yuan, compared to 1,109,898 yuan in the same quarter last year.</p>
<h3>British Church to Create a Fundraising Christmas for Disaster Relief: Performance and Fundraising for Hangzhou Refugees: American Church Members Donate Clothing to Shanghai for Distribution to Jews</h3>
<p>The British Church on Jiujiang Road in this city will begin a historic fundraising campaign, scheduled to begin on the 12th of this month during the Christmas season. At that time, there will be wonderful performances and skits, and all donations will be handed over to Bishop Curtis of Hangzhou to help local Chinese refugees. The performances will be organized by the church's youth fellowship. All the scenery and other aspects have been carefully designed. The performances will begin with readings of biblical passages, accompanied by music and hymns. Admission will be free. This type of performance was very popular in the Middle Ages. In recent times, it has been felt that ancient religious dramas have great aesthetic value, so churches throughout England have resumed their use, from rural churches to the world-famous Canterbury Cathedral in London. Every Christmas, these dramas are performed, but the form and dialogue are different from ancient times. The content, however, remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Apply Quickly to Receive Donated Clothing</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Office of the China Child Welfare Association began collecting winter clothing for poor children in the city, it has received more than 12,000 yuan in donations and more than 800 pieces of new and old cotton clothing. The association, recognizing that the weather is getting colder and that poor children urgently need clothing, is currently planning to rush the production of 2,000 sets of cotton clothing to meet the urgent need. It is understood that the association has already printed "Request for Winter Clothing" forms. Any impoverished families who want to request clothing for their children can obtain them from the association's office (No. 208, Middle Duoya Road). The applicant's name, address, family situation, and the children's ages and names must be provided, as well as proof from reputable professionals, or schools, social organizations, etc. After verification, the clothing will be issued.</p>
<p>American Church Members Send Winter Clothing to Shanghai</p>
<p>The American Church in this city, after consulting with the Salvation Army and the American Red Cross, telegraphed its New York headquarters to reroute two large packages of winter clothing, which had been stranded in the United States and could not be shipped to Europe, to Shanghai to help Jewish refugees in this city who had been displaced from Europe. It has been learned that this winter clothing has arrived in port on the American mail ship President Coolidge. The American Church has sent people to the docks to take care of the unloading and transportation to the church's hall in Hongkou, and then will distribute the clothing to the refugees to keep them warm through the winter. If there is any surplus, it will be discussed with other charitable organizations to determine how to distribute it. There are more than 14,000 Jewish refugees in this city, living in various shelters in the Huishan district. Previously, due to a lack of relief funds, the daily meals had been reduced from three to one. In light of this, Jewish relief organizations appealed for relief from all sectors on the +th of this month. Furthermore, Russian immigrants in this city, scattered throughout the Hongkou area, recently requested relief from the Kaiyuan Coal Mining Company. The company generously agreed to donate several tons of coal and will also sell other coal at a reduced price to the White Russian immigrants.</p>
<h3>Huihua Money Shops to Change to Limited Organizations: Join the Guild and List on the Market Next Spring</h3>
<p>In addition to the Xinzheng Money Shop, which has completed its fundraising and set up a preparatory office managed by Xu Shanchang and Fu Tingxu, Baochang Money Shop, with a capital of 500,000 yuan and managed by Chen Lishan, and Yonglong Money Shop, with a capital of 500,000 yuan and managed by Luo Shaodong, are also raising funds. Once the preparations are complete, they will be listed on the market. It is said that the listing date for each shop will be in the spring of next year. In the future, they will definitely join the Money Shop Guild and become limited organization money shops.</p>
<h3>A Fire at the Japanese Army Depot: Fires Shine Across the Sky, Munitions Explode, Burning for Hours, All Ships Inbound and Outbound Are Blocked</h3>
<p>The Japanese Army Depot in Wusong suddenly caught fire at around 11:20 AM yesterday. Because the interior was filled with military supplies such as fuel, which are easily flammable, once it caught fire, it quickly spread. Although the local fire department and the customs fireboat, together with the Japanese army and navy, worked hard to put out the fire, the munitions stored inside exploded violently and were not easily extinguished for a while. As a result, the fire shined across the sky, and the flames soared. All ships inbound and outbound were stopped. As of 3:00 PM, the fire had not been completely extinguished. The cause of the fire is not easy to determine for the time being.</p>
<h3>Economic Warfare: China Has Achieved Victory: Three-Nation Loans Totaling US$400 Million: The Battlefield Will Change After Weapons are Replenished</h3>
<p>According to a certain financial figure in this city, since China's war of resistance against Japan began, the total amount of standby loans from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to China has not been less than US$400 million. Foreign currency bonds issued by the Chinese government are not included in this figure. In the past, US loans to China were only 25 million yuan per batch, and British loans were only 2.5 million pounds each time. But this time, the US loan alone reached 100 million yuan, and the UK will also lend China 10 million pounds at a time, totaling about US$40 million, which proves the active support of Britain and the United States for China. China has obtained this huge amount of money, and its finances have become more abundant. The future of the war is unusually optimistic.</p>
<p>The Numbers of Victory and Defeat are Already Very Clear</p>
<p>The economic situation of China and Japan, one growing and the other declining, the numbers of victory and defeat are already very clear. This British loan is different from the previous two. The previous loans focused on stabilizing the exchange rate, which was used by the Japanese to a considerable extent. This time, the main purpose is to purchase British goods, and the scope extends to the British colonies, which is even more important. At this time, the Anglo-German war is in full swing, and German planes and submarines are very rampant. Ships around the British Isles are sinking at a rate of about 100,000 tons per week, and Britain itself has a huge demand for war materials, making it difficult to supply foreign countries at the same time.</p>
<p>Full Utilization of Foreign Materials</p>
<p>Therefore, all of China's British loans have not yet been fully utilized due to transportation reasons. Goods from the UK itself are not easy to transport to the Far East. The expansion of the purchase location to the British pound group of countries is intended to remedy previous shortcomings. In the future, China will have the opportunity to utilize materials from Burma, India, and Australia. Recently, due to China's proximity to Burma, the daily necessities of the people in the interior are mostly obtained from Burma and India, such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and rice. A large amount has been transported to the southwest in recent times. Therefore, not only will the government's needed materials be easily obtained in the future, but also the daily necessities of the people in the rear will have more sources of supply, and there will be no danger of funds being used by the enemy. This is far better than the previous unrestricted supply without regard to region.</p>
<h3>French Consul-General M. Magre Reviews the Police Yesterday, Approximately One Thousand Chinese and Foreign Police Officers Participate, Those with Meritorious Service Are Awarded Medals</h3>
<p>The police force of the French Concession held its annual grand review ceremony at 10:30 AM yesterday, and medals were awarded to Chinese and foreign police officers with outstanding meritorious service. The event was presided over by French Consul-General M. Magre and French Police Commissioner-General Favier, serving as chief and deputy inspectors, respectively. It took place on the square in the Gujiazhai Garden on Rue Luban. Military officers from various countries stationed in Shanghai, including two officers each from the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the police force, were invited to attend the review ceremony.</p>
<p>Participating Troops</p>
<p>The troops participating yesterday, commanded by Deputy Commissioner-General and Chief Inspector Poulain of the French Concession Police, included a military band led by D'Erneville, the police flag held by Deputy Inspector Gaodong, four companies of Annamese police, each equipped with four heavy machine guns and two machine gun vehicles, led by Chief Inspector Megham, Inspector Buchaguan, and Deputy Inspector Bonce, a squad of elite troops, a squad of Russian police led by Russian Major Yadabvique, ten machine gun vehicles, six armored vehicles, and ten armed motorcycles. In total, there were over one thousand Chinese and foreign police officers.</p>
<p>Awarding Medals</p>
<p>When French Consul-General M. Magre arrived at the Gujiazhai Garden, he was received by Police Commissioner-General Favier. The military band struck up a tune and played the French national anthem. After M. Magre's inspection, medals were awarded to Public Works Bureau officials and various police officers: a gold medal to Detective Brock, a silver medal to Detective Jackson, a bronze medal to Detective Fals, Detective Demit, Russian Police Slavov, Squad Member No. 2855, No. 393, Chinese Police No. 283, No. 103, No. 302, No. 154, No. 790, Probationary Chinese Detectives No. 62, No. 392, and No. 404; an unrewarded silver medal from the Public Works Bureau was awarded to Inspectors Ulis, Secretary Bowman, Chinese Sergeant No. 17, and No. 100, Chinese Deputy Inspectors Wang Rusong and Tang Yunqing, Detective Jiang Shangwen; an unrewarded bronze medal was awarded to Russian Police Tanimaski, Annamese Police No. 2 and No. 24, Chinese Secretary Xi Yongfa, Chinese Deputy Sergeant No. 207, Chinese Police No. 209, No. 40, No. 361, No. 360, and No. 407, Chinese Deputy Inspector Xie Guangming, Detectives Guo Shaodong and Tian Shiqing, Squad Members No. 36 and No. 43, and Tailors No. 24 and No. 11.</p>
<h3>The French Concession's Housing Regulations Seem Unlikely to Be Implemented; the Consular Authorities Cannot Amend the Civil Code, But the Rent Investigation Committee Remains Optimistic</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the draft decree proposed by the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee regarding housing issues within the concession (which stipulates various housing regulations) has been submitted to French Consul-General M. Magre in Shanghai. However, committee members stated that they are still closely studying the entire set of regulations and will not submit a definitive draft to the French Consul in the next few days. It is understood that the draft decree aims to abolish illegal rent increases, the collection of sub-rent, and disputes over forced evictions. The chairman of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee visited various esteemed judges and consular representatives in the city, showed them the draft decree for consideration, and expressed their view of whether the housing regulations were purely police regulations or attached to the national civil law concerning expatriates. If the various consulates recognize these regulations as police regulations, then the French Consul-General has the authority to implement them. However, if they are considered attached to the civil law, it is feared that the various consulates will take an unfavorable attitude towards these regulations. If the civil law of the consular courts includes these housing regulations, then the civil law must be amended, and the consular authorities in Shanghai cannot arbitrarily amend the civil law. It is heard that the chairman of the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee remains optimistic about the success of the decree. However, according to various opinions, no matter how appropriate the decree may be, from a legal perspective, its implementation is unlikely.</p>
<h3>Residents of Western Shanghai Eagerly Seek to Relocate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were still no signs of lifting the blockade in the western Shanghai area. Wangjia Lane and nearby alleys were still being searched continuously. The "Shanghai Municipal Public Bus" still operated to and from Yuyuan Road and Daxi Road. However, the "Route 1" bus to and from Daxi Road and Dunxin Road suspended operations at 5 PM due to engine failure, leading to severe overcrowding on Routes 1 and 2 to and from Yuyuan Road. Residents within the blockade area complained incessantly, calling the two-cent bus fare "toll money." Some Chinese and foreign residents have begun searching for housing in the concessions, and the unauthorized operation of public buses indicates their intentions. Therefore, it is generally believed that the area west of Haig Road, where roads have been built beyond the concession boundaries, has lost the guarantee of peaceful living and working. It is hoped that the concession authorities will issue a formal statement and take action to stop this behavior.</p>
<h3>First Special Court Staff Request Rice Subsidies</h3>
<p>The judges, prosecutors, clerks, and recorders of the Higher First Branch Court and the First Special Court all received salary increases approved by the Ministry of Judicial Administration in September of this year. Judges and prosecutors received a 20% increase, clerks received a 40% increase, and recorders and bailiffs received a uniform 19% increase, all retroactive to January of this year. Guards and security personnel received the same treatment. With the price of rice already exceeding 100 yuan, the staff of the two courts felt that their cost of living had further increased and was difficult to sustain. Therefore, they jointly submitted a petition to the court authorities yesterday, requesting a monthly rice subsidy equivalent to five dou of rice, regardless of future rice price fluctuations. The court authorities have not yet provided a concrete response to the staff's request, but it is expected to be resolved satisfactorily soon.</p>

<h3>President Coolidge Arrives in Port This Morning, Carrying American Nationals Returning Home, Only the Coolidge Scheduled to Evacuate Nationals This Year</h3>
<p>The American President liner "President Coolidge" of the American Mail Line arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 AM this morning from the United States via the Philippines and Hong Kong, and berthed at the 12th and 13th pontoons in the Huangpu River. All luggage and passengers were transported by customs launches to the New Customs Wharf for landing. This is the first time this ship has come to China. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 8:00 PM on the 10th, sailing via Kobe and Yokohama in Japan and Honolulu, Hawaii, to return to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Evacuation This Year</p>
<p>When the ship leaves Shanghai, it will carry a large number of American nationals returning home. Passengers who have booked tickets on the ship will be transported in three batches by launches at 5:00 PM, 7:00 PM, and 9:00 PM today for boarding. According to information, the only other ship scheduled to return to the United States this year is the "President Coolidge", scheduled to depart on the 31st of this month. Since the US government advised American nationals in the Far East to evacuate and return home, the number of people scheduled to return to the United States this year is quite large. Therefore, the cabin space on the "President Coolidge" has long been fully booked. All American nationals who have not been able to book seats will have to wait until next year to take a ship back to the United States.</p>
<p>American Nationals in Kuling</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that there is currently only one American national (female) in Kuling. It is understood that she will also be leaving soon. Afterwards, the number of foreign nationals in Kuling will be less than forty. The fuel problem for wintering there this year has become difficult. Fortunately, the wood and charcoal available nearby are still sufficient, but the price is almost twice as high as last year. The prices of all other commodities have also increased. Although the rice harvest at the foot of the mountain is abundant, the price of rice is five times higher than last year. Most of the lower-middle class Chinese, unable to make a living, have left Kuling and returned home. However, there are still more than one hundred extremely poor Chinese families who have nowhere to go. The relief committee is considering measures to provide assistance to them when the truly severe cold weather arrives. The general situation in Kuling is still considered peaceful, but due to the poverty of some people, there are occasional incidents of breaking into houses and stealing.</p>
<p>Large Volume of Mail</p>
<p>The post office originally planned to send a large volume of mail to the United States and then to Europe on the Russian Empress of the Shan Chang Hing Steamship Company. However, because the Russian Empress was requisitioned by the British military commander in the Far East for military use and stopped coming to Shanghai, it had to be replaced by the "President Coolidge". It is expected to arrive in San Francisco in half a month, and then be transported by rail to New York before being transferred by ship to London. It is expected to arrive there around mid-January of next year, a week later than if it had been carried by the Russian Empress.</p>
<h3>Child Disappears, Neighbors Collude in Kidnapping, Resulting in All Three Criminals Being Captured</h3>
<p>Zhou Mujin, a Suzhou native who works as a servant for a foreigner, lives in a flat in Jianzhong Lane, Caojia Lane, Avenue Joffre. He is 35 years old and has a five-year-old son named A'gan. On the morning of the 26th of last month, A'gan suddenly disappeared from the front of his house. At around 6:00 PM that day, Zhou found a letter in front of his door, which was an anonymous communication. Upon reading it, the contents roughly stated that the child A'gan had been kidnapped by "us" and was currently hidden at the end of Daxi Road, demanding a ransom of 1,500 yuan. Neighbors Wu Abing (28 years old) and Chen Fugen (30 years old), both from Suzhou, volunteered to negotiate with the kidnappers. The next day, Zhou gave them 800 yuan. The two men took the money and went, and indeed brought the child A'gan back. At the time, Zhou expressed deep gratitude to Wu and Chen for reuniting him with his flesh and blood, and did not report it to the police. After some time, detectives Dai Rongji, Zhang Dongcheng, and Tao Ronglin of the French Concession Police learned that Wu and Chen were highly suspicious. They were arrested, and yesterday evening around 6:00 PM, a conspirator, Li A'gen, was also apprehended. According to their confession, the three had participated in the premeditated kidnapping, earning a ransom of 800 yuan. Wu and Li each received 200 yuan, and Wu Abing used the remaining 400 yuan. They directly admitted to kidnapping the child.</p>
<h3>Thieves Rampant in Hongkou District, Averaging More Than Ten Cases Daily</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, since the beginning of this year, thieves have been rampant in the Hongkou district, with theft cases occurring one after another. The Japanese authorities are deeply concerned about this. Therefore, recently, various road commercial associations and other organizations have formed "self-defense groups" to pay attention day and night. However, theft cases still occur every day. It is said that from January 1st to December 1st of this year, the Japanese consulate has compiled statistics, totaling 4,514 theft cases, averaging 410 cases per month and 13 cases per day. The astonishing number of theft cases has far exceeded that of last year.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Arrested for Colluding with Robbers</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 1st of this month, Chinese Chief Detective and others from the Putuo Road Police Station arrested four robbers, Jiangbei natives Wang Renlong, Xu Gonglian, Yin Buyan, and Tian Xiufeng, in Hengye Lane, Rue Robertson. It was discovered that these men had robbed a resident at 672 Zhejiang Road of more than 5,000 yuan in property between October 20th and 21st. They were escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention pending trial. They confessed that their fellow villager Wu Shaoshan, who works as a gatekeeper at the Farmers Bank at 1182 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, was the one who provided them with information. Chinese and Western detectives went to the address, together with detectives from the French Concession Police Station, and arrested Wu the gatekeeper and brought him back to the police station. He was escorted to the Criminal Third Tribunal of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested detention, stating that he had also served as a patrolman in the Public Concession. When questioned, the defendant did not confess.

<h3>The Case of the Female Guide's Marital Discord: Ordered to Cohabit and Bear the Costs of Litigation</h3>
<p>Mei Fei, a member of the Yang Guifei Singer Troupe, also known as Xu Huifen (also known as Xiang Jinxian, 19 years old, residing at 159 Shanhai Pass Road), was originally a country girl from Wuxi. Because of her attractive appearance, she was lured to Shanghai by Zhang Nianxian in January of last year. On May 11th of last year, she married Wang Baolian, with lawyers Sun Jie and Hu Xujing as witnesses, and the wedding was officially held at the Sanhe Building. Not long after the marriage, she engaged in the profession of a dance girl, working as a dance partner in nightclubs such as the Cathay, earning a considerable income. In February of this year, she began working for the Yang Guifei Singer Troupe. In May of this year, she separated from her husband due to a quarrel. Wang Baolian accused Mei Fei of improper behavior with Yi Lu during the separation and sued her. Mei Fei denied in court that Wang was her formal husband, and therefore, the couple's feelings became increasingly broken. Recently, Wang Baolian, citing the civil law that stipulates that spouses have an obligation to cohabit, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Tribunal of the First Special Court, requesting that Mei Fei be ordered to return home to cohabit and that the defendant bear the costs of litigation. It is heard that Mei Fei is dissatisfied with the judgment and will hire a lawyer to appeal to the Higher Second Branch Court.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Director Xu of the Department of Education Summarizes Education in Zhejiang Province Over the Past Year (3)</h3>
<p>(3) Regarding the reasons for the laxity in inspection work, in addition to various reasons such as few personnel, many subordinate agencies, heavy internal affairs, and many part-time jobs, there are also those who cannot depart for inspection due to insufficient travel expenses. It is found that some counties have a monthly allowance of three yuan (such as Pan'an), four yuan (such as Chun'an), and five yuan (such as Xiangshan, Ninghai, Suichang, Rui'an, and Sui'an). The most is fifteen yuan (such as Zhenhai and Yongkang), and others are six yuan, eight yuan, and ten yuan per month. Only six counties have actual reimbursement (such as Xinchang, Kaihua, Jiande, Pingyang, Songyang, and Jingning). The department previously stipulated that the monthly travel allowance for national education inspectors was thirty yuan, which all counties considered too much. However, they do not know that active supervision is an important task for improving education. The following should be noted by all counties in the future: (1) The travel allowance for inspectors should be increased as much as possible, with actual reimbursement; (2) The travel allowance for supervisors should be paid from administrative expenses; (3) The travel allowance for education instructors can be paid from the national education fund; (4) There should be more than four months of outside inspection each semester.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding the procedures for correspondence between counties and education agencies, they can be carried out in accordance with the regulations in the "Matters to be Noted When County Education Administrative Agencies Implement National Education" promulgated by the Ministry. Upward correspondence should use concise reports, and downward correspondence should use local newspapers or county government publications to create special columns for announcements, in order to save correspondence procedures and simplify matters. In the past, schools that did not subscribe to newspapers should now make them universally read.</p>
<p>(5) Regarding the distribution of education funds, various conveniences should be provided to the receiving agencies. The education section and the accounting office should clearly define the procedures to avoid separation.</p>
<p>(6) Regarding the appointment of education section personnel, it should be handled in accordance with the recently promulgated "Precautions for Handling County-Level Education Administration" by the Ministry. The difficulties currently recognized by the counties are: (1) It is not easy to find three people to recommend, so it can be changed to one or two people; (2) The prescribed qualifications are too strict, making it difficult to recruit, except for section chiefs, a commutation is requested; (3) It is requested that all current personnel be commissioned without any changes, and new appointments will be handled in accordance with the regulations; (4) Handling in accordance with the regulations may cause work to be interrupted halfway through. The answers to these suggestions are as follows: 1. Current personnel with equivalent qualifications can be submitted for commissioning; 2. If it is not possible to select two people to recommend for the position of section chief in accordance with the regulations, the reasons can be stated and two people can be recommended. Other supervisors and district education instructors can also do the same; 3. Before the section chief is commissioned, a deputy can be assigned first, or a supervisor can temporarily act as the head of the section, so as to avoid work interruption; 4. In the future, the province will register a number of qualified county education administrators for the counties to choose from; 5. Personnel who have been commissioned must abide by the regulations in the precautions and must not be arbitrarily replaced. The Department must approve the change before the education cause is not interrupted due to frequent personnel transfers.</p>
<p>2. Regarding the implementation of national education: (1) The decision to implement national education is due to the hurried preparation time and the three changes in the plan. The difficulties felt by the counties must be many. The Department was constrained by the orders of the Ministry and the number of central government subsidies changed from time to time, so the plan had to be changed accordingly. Recently, the number of schools to be established in each county and the amount of subsidies have been determined within the possible scope of provincial funds. If there are any discrepancies, the counties should seek ways to remedy them. The approved number refers to the number of subsidies. If the local government can raise funds on its own, it is better to run more schools than the approved number. The funding for the implementation of national education is based on the principle that each county raises its own funds. Therefore, the "Measures for Raising Funds for Township Central Schools and Bao National Schools" promulgated by the Ministry has been announced. The measures are quite detailed. If they can be implemented effectively, it will not be without any solutions. It depends on human effort. I hope everyone will work hard. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Food Problem in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>— Liu Xizhang</p>
<p>To discuss Shanghai's food problem today, we should look at it from two perspectives: before and after the war. Before the war, there was one way of looking at it, and after the war, there is another. Before the war, the aim was certainly to eliminate the rice panic, but the primary method was to consider the overall economy, such as the issues of foreign rice versus domestic rice, and the impact of low grain prices on farmers, etc. Today, after the war, while we still aim to eliminate the rice panic, we must adopt more feasible methods due to the unique environment of Shanghai. That is, we cannot start purely from theory, but should prioritize the facts.</p>
<p>The first factor forming today's food problem in Shanghai is the daily decrease in the source of domestic rice, which is also subject to "control." Initially, a price limit policy was adopted, originally set at 14 yuan, which was breached, soon breaking 16 yuan, then 17 yuan, and after that, prices rose exponentially, reaching over 100 yuan recently. The price limit policy could not be maintained because, in addition to speculation, one reason was the "control" of domestic rice sources, and another was the limitation on the base price of foreign rice due to exchange rates in the producing areas. Subsequently, the so-called rice market in Shanghai became a market dominated by foreign rice, with the market price of domestic rice being controlled by foreign rice. At this time, although the market price of foreign rice was constantly rising, the source was still relatively smooth, so the monopoly of speculators was limited. However, today, the source of Vietnamese foreign rice has been restricted to a limited extent due to the tense situation (but ships still arrive every day). The extent to which speculators can raise prices is much greater than before. Therefore, for the sake of Shanghai's food supply, the best first step would be to clear the source of domestic rice, but this is impossible. In fact, we have to take a step back and clear the source of foreign rice. This so-called clearing can be interpreted in two ways: the first is to directly order rice from abroad, and the second is to temporarily adjust the rice stored in this port to alleviate the current panic.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the current food panic is the aforementioned political problems in the foreign rice producing areas, which hinder transportation. Therefore, the price increase is by no means due to the increase in production area prices, but a unique increase in this city, rising five yuan today and ten yuan tomorrow. This is definitely not an increase in freight, insurance, or various costs, but a "man-made" increase by speculators.</p>
<p>Food Before and After the War</p>
<p>Therefore, let's first look at whether a rice panic is possible in Shanghai. There are two main conditions for the formation of a rice panic in Shanghai: the first is limited reserves, and the second is the cutoff of sources. Let's first look at the inventory.</p>
<p>Regarding the reserves of grain, the figures released by various parties differ. Some say there are only hundreds of thousands of bags, while others say there are millions of bags. Naturally, no one knows for sure. However, from various calculations, a reserve of hundreds of thousands of bags is clearly too little; if the person who said this is not shallow, then it is easy to suspect that they have been deceived by rice weevils! Based on the facts, we can first determine that Shanghai has no shortage of food reserves for the following reasons.</p>
<p>A few days ago, various newspapers published statistics from a certain economic statistical agency (published in the newspapers of the 7th of this month), using three methods to confirm the abundance of foreign rice reserves in Shanghai. The first is based on customs records, subtracting exports from imports and then deducting consumption, concluding that Shanghai should have 4 million piculs of foreign rice. The second is based on warehouse reports, which have doubled in the past year. The third is based on arrival statistics, with several thousand bags of foreign rice arriving every day for the past four days. Of these three points, the third point is entirely factual; the second point tells us that rice is increasing without decreasing; the first point is relatively unreliable, firstly because imports through smuggling are not included, and secondly because the foreign rice going to Hongkou may not have been counted; as for the reserves from previous years, the source of domestic rice is even less accounted for. Based on these points, we can know that the amount of rice stored in this port in recent years must often be over one or two million bags.</p>
<p>Why is everyone worried about the arrival of a rice panic, while we appreciate the abundance of reserves? What we should pay the most attention to is that the public's grain reserves today are very different from before the war. Before the war, it was rare for a middle-class family to reserve one or two bags of rice, but today, families above the middle class will not buy rice unless they buy ten or five bags at a time! After consuming two bags, they buy another five bags. In this way, the rice reserves naturally become thicker and thicker. Everyone of course knows the environment of Shanghai today, and naturally knows to prepare for a rainy day, so "stocking up on rice" is the principle of general families. There is also group purchasing of rice, which makes everyone particularly alarmed about the food shortage problem, and also has the tendency to increase hoarding of rice. This is not to oppose group purchasing of rice, but to point out the effects that group purchasing of rice gives us. In the past, the hoarding of rice in Shanghai was oligopolistic, by rice weevils, by financial groups organized by speculators, but today, in addition to the above two, the reserves are also distributed to general families above the middle class. The former is oligopolistic, while the latter is widespread among the public. Which of these two has a larger amount of reserves is very obvious.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the source of foreign rice has never been cut off. Saigon only banned the export of No. 1 foreign rice, and did not ban the export of No. 2 foreign rice, but the arrival of ships is not as orderly as in the past. Even if there is a problem with the source, causing a rice panic in Shanghai, it will still be in the future, not the present of a year and a half!</p>
<p>So where is the crux of Shanghai's food problem? The main problem is the skill of the people handling the food problem. When Vietnam was in turmoil, the already worried Shanghai public was deeply afraid of the food supply being cut off and had the intention to stockpile a large amount of rice. But at that time, someone initiated a large-scale group purchase of rice. It was right to have group purchase of rice at that time, but it was really unacceptable to shout about group purchase of rice. What's more, they were still shouting high-sounding slogans such as setting up warehouses to store rice, which could not be implemented, making people feel that they had ulterior motives. Because it is clear that Vietnam is in turmoil, and doing business is not as easy as usual. But they insist on persuading people to buy a large amount of rice; if they are not short-sighted, are they raising the price of rice? The original hope of the so-called group purchase of rice was to obtain some cheap prices and not be exploited by rice weevils. May I ask, when buying rice at this time, when the source of rice is not expected in the near future, isn't it only to collect the stored rice in this city? On the one hand, they encourage people to buy rice, and on the other hand, they do not actually buy rice from abroad. Isn't this equivalent to raising the limited foreign rice on the market indefinitely? If the price of rice rises, families above the middle class have sufficient savings and it is not a problem; but the working masses who rely on daily wage income have to reluctantly pay high prices to fill their stomachs. The promotion of rice purchase was originally a kind intention, but in fact, it created opportunities for rice weevils and speculators to make unjust fortunes. There is no greater pain than this fact, and no more unwise action than this!</p>
<p>Remedial Measures</p>
<p>Since we believe that, on the whole, the total inventory in Shanghai is sufficient to meet the consumption of all the people for a fairly long period, the first step should be to conduct a registration of rice consumption within the boundary, including private individuals and institutions, restrict their excessive stockpiling, and allow the Municipal Council or commercial organizations to purchase the excessively stored rice at fair prices when necessary, and sell it at a fair price. At the same time, the Municipal Council should lead the commercial organizations to prepare several million piculs of rice as peace rice, to prepare for the entire Shanghai food problem. It is not necessary for the money industry to advance the money for this rice, but public bonds can be issued to avoid the parties concerned from misappropriating and cheating.</p>
<p>For group rice purchases, the Municipal Council should lead various commercial organizations to form a agency to handle the matter, publish the production area prices daily, and accept commissions to purchase on behalf of others.</p>
<p>In short, today's Shanghai food problem is not a matter of scarcity, but of uneven distribution; at this time, only adjustment methods can be used to suppress the panic deliberately created by speculators.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also put forward two facts: First, the impact of expensive food on ordinary people is far greater than on the rich, so all monopolistic behaviors are the most cruel. Second, the result of food monopoly will inevitably affect the entire social order, which should not be ignored! Finally, (1) we hope that all warehouse and rice industry employees will check their own salary income and family expenses. You must know that accomplices are also committing suicide! You must know that it is more convenient for you than anyone else to report rice profiteers. (2) We advise middle and upper-class families not to only sweep the snow in front of their own doors, and help the speculators' schemes. (3) We advise warehouses and storage industries to universally set a deadline for leaving the warehouse; we also advise the money industry to universally prohibit rice mortgages, and urge those who have already done so to redeem them.</p>
<h3>The Development of China's Central Banking System</h3>
<p>— Li Baojiang</p>
<p>The development of modern banking shows a trend, that is, most have a strong central bank to control market credit, and various other banks regard the central bank as their backing; therefore, when discussing the banking system, the central bank is the focus.</p>
<p>The so-called central bank is actually a bank of banks; it bears the mission of controlling finance, and its nature is different from that of ordinary banks. Its business should not compete with ordinary banks; its tasks are at least four: First, to unify issuance, comprehensively plan to expand and contract the amount of currency according to the needs of the social economy, and stabilize the market's finance; Second, to centralize reserves, accept the deposit reserves of commercial banks, and be responsible for the transfer and adjustment of each commercial bank at any time; Third, to act as the national treasury, managing all government fiscal revenues and expenditures; Fourth, to set interest rates, implement a rediscount policy for bills, or implement open market operations to manage market credit. With these four points, the central bank can become the head of a country's financial system and the backbone of stabilizing market finance.</p>
<p>Progress Before the War</p>
<p>China had no so-called central bank before 1928; the China and Communications Banks actually had the nature of a central bank. At that time, the branches of the China and Communications Banks were all over the country; the banknotes issued by them circulated throughout the country. Salt customs taxes were also handled by these two banks, which were deeply trusted by Chinese and foreigners. In October 1928, the National Government promulgated regulations to establish a central bank in Shanghai. However, due to the complexity of the domestic financial situation, by the time of the August 13th War of Resistance Against Japan, it seemed that China's central bank had not yet fully possessed all of the above conditions; therefore, before the outbreak of the war in 1937, the government had promulgated the Central Reserve Bank Law to reorganize the existing central bank in order to thoroughly complete the mission of the central bank. Unfortunately, due to the outbreak of the war, it had to be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>Due to historical relations, China's central bank had to seek the cooperation of the China and Communications Banks in various aspects; thus, a three-in-one banking organization was implicitly formed. In July 1934, in order to maintain financial stability, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the Savings Bank Law; all savings banks, after absorbing deposits, should deposit at least one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits to the central bank's treasury to purchase government securities and other assets with certain guarantees; this was the initial centralization of reserves. In the spring of 1935, the financial market was extremely panicked. The three banks of China, Central and Communications jointly released loans, and were able to safely overcome the difficulties; this method of rescuing the market was unprecedented. In November 1935, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the new currency law, implemented the legal tender policy, centralized issuance reserves, and unified banknote issuance; commercial banks' use of cash relied on the legal tender of government banks; government banks had an invisible tool to control credit. In 1936, the Central Bank formally participated in the clearing house, and the clearing fund for bills was jointly preserved by the three banks of China, Central and Communications, which was a major progress in China's financial system.</p>
<p>However, in terms of centralized reserves, although savings banks should purchase securities with one-quarter of their total deposits and deposit them with the central bank, they were securities rather than cash, and were only limited to the savings deposit portion, not including commercial deposits. The clearing fund of the clearing house was divided among the three banks of China, Central and Communications according to the ratio of 442, so the reserves cannot be said to be thoroughly centralized. In terms of interest rates, commercial bills in China are not developed at all, there is no bill discount market, commercial banks rarely undertake bill discount business, and the central bank has no rediscount business to speak of, let alone a discount policy. In terms of banknote issuance, although it has been unified, the issuance right is still distributed among the four national banks; acting as the national treasury is a right specially granted to the central bank, and it is easy to do.</p>
<p>Post-War Construction</p>
<p>However, since the War of Resistance Against Japan, the government has taken various constructive measures to stabilize wartime finance, and China's banking system has accelerated its sound development.</p>
<p>A. Four-Bank Lending Committee After the August 13th War broke out, the authorities promulgated measures to stabilize finance, restricting withdrawals, and at the same time established a lending committee in Shanghai, and ordered the China, Central, Communications and Agricultural Banks to establish joint offices and joint lending committees in the locations of their respective banks, specializing in handling the lending and transfer mortgages of agriculture, industry and mining; so that the production of various industries could proceed; and the circulation of commodities could be smoothly established. However, if the administration of the four banks is still independent, it will be difficult to collect and concentrate affairs and command them freely; therefore, there is the establishment of a joint office of the four banks; this institution already has the prototype of a central bank.</p>
<p>B. General Office of the Joint Office of the Four Banks To understand the nature of the General Office of the Four Banks, we only need to observe its business and organization: The highest administrative body of the General Office of the Four Banks is the Board of Directors, composed of the Governor and Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, the Chairmen and General Managers of the China, Communications and Agricultural Banks, and several representatives sent by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs; the Chairman of the Board of Directors and three Executive Directors are specially appointed by the National Government according to regulations; and the Chairman of the Board of Directors is directly granted special powers by the Ministry of Finance, and can take convenient measures and exercise the powers of the four banks on their behalf. As for the powers and business of the General Office of the Four Banks, the main points are as follows: (1) Adjustment of the four banks' securities; (2) Joint lending matters of the four banks and joint investment in special wartime production; (3) Design and distribution of the national financial network; (4) Centralization and use of funds; (5) Entrusted issuance and application of small denomination banknotes; (6) Review of remittances in inland and ports; (7) Review of foreign exchange applications; (8) Adjustment of wartime materials; (9) Management of the collection of raw gold and silver; (10) Promotion of special savings; (11) Review of the four banks' issuance reserves and review of the four banks' budget and final accounts; (12) Sending personnel to inspect the business of the four banks and assess the work of the four banks. It can be seen that the General Office of the Four Banks is actually a wartime mechanism for concentrating financial power, bearing a direct command, management, and supervision responsibility.</p>
<p>This organization is similar to the Federal Reserve System in the United States, making the China, Central, Communications and Agricultural Banks an organic whole. However, there is still a need for thorough improvement in its ability to control market credit and the characteristics that a central bank should possess.</p>
<p>C. Deposit Reserve In addition to the established central financial institutions in China, further research should be conducted on how to gradually complete the tasks of concentrating reserves and setting interest rates. Therefore, in the Provisional Measures for Managing Banks in Extraordinary Times promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and Banking this August, it was clearly stipulated that "In addition to savings deposits that should be handled in accordance with the Savings Bank Law, banks should use 20% of the total amount of ordinary deposits received as reserve funds, transfer them to any of the China, Central, Communications and Agricultural Banks in the local area, and the receiving bank will give appropriate deposit interest." This system is also similar to the situation of member banks in the United States. Because member banks in the United States must deposit deposit reserves with the local Federal Reserve Bank to cope with the occurrence of withdrawals, the deposit reserve rate is slightly different from that in China: for example, the central reserve city is 19.5%, the ordinary reserve city is 15%, and the rural reserve city is 10.5%; the more prosperous the area, the larger the inflow and outflow of bank funds, and the higher the deposit reserve rate should be. The US authorities also raise and lower this reserve rate according to the financial situation to control the interbank lending of various member banks. As for China's regulations on deposit reserves, in addition to having the general meaning, they also contain special intentions: that is, (1) to cope with withdrawals and protect the safety of depositors; (2) to regulate the credit expansion of each bank; (3) to prevent speculation and hoarding, etc.</p>
<p>China has never had regulations on deposit reserves; according to various statistics, the average cash reserve of twelve banks in Shanghai in 1935 (with total deposits of more than 30 million yuan) was at most around 35%. However, in fact, the so-called cash reserve of Chinese banks includes treasury, in transit, and interbank deposits. For example, if 30 million yuan is received in deposits, excluding interbank deposits, the cash on hand is only 10 million yuan. If the deposit reserve is limited to cash in the treasury, according to the above statistics, the average cash reserve of the twelve banks is between 8% and 12%; in general, it is mostly around 10%, which is consistent with London. There should be no difficulty in coping with ordinary withdrawals with this ratio; but it should be noted that China's situation is different from that of the UK. The UK is a country with a developed credit system, so a ratio of 10% is enough to meet ordinary needs; as for China, the habit of using bill circulation has not yet been formed, so maintaining a ratio of 10% in peacetime cannot be said to be a stable ratio; let alone after the outbreak of the war? Therefore, it is a good measure to change the habitual 10% to a legal 20% in the Provisional Measures for Managing Banks in Extraordinary Times; it is also another progress in China's national banks' control of market credit.</p>
<p>D. Interim Measures for Promoting Bank Acceptance and Discount Business There is one more thing that is worthy of our comfort, that is, the Ministry of Finance recently promulgated the Interim Measures for Promoting Bank Acceptance and Discount Business, ordering the four banks to implement bill acceptance and discount rediscount and other businesses as soon as possible. This measure is closely related to the central bank's rediscount policy.</p>
<p>In peacetime, the central bank can control market credit by raising and lowering the discount rate; when market credit is excessively inflated, the central bank can raise the rediscount rate to warn ordinary banks not to abuse lending, and the market's chips can be reduced accordingly; conversely, when market credit is excessively tightened, the central bank can lower the rediscount rate to allow ordinary banks to prepare interest-free funds and calmly lend, and the market's chips can gradually increase; with this method, the financial market can be stabilized.</p>
<p>China's credit system is not yet developed; commercial habits, creditors and debtors, mostly rely on bookkeeping, and rarely use commercial bills. Debtors are inherently subject to the burden of bad debts, and because the repayment period for bookkeeping debts is fixed, funds are also at risk of being frozen. However, commercial bills can be used as credit instruments; because their occurrence must be based on actual transactions; they themselves have their own flow function, and after being discounted to the bank, in addition to the discounter, the acceptor also bears joint and several liability for repayment. And in the discount and rediscount, it can also play its role in correcting improper commercial transactions.</p>

<h3>Financial Review</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>—December 7— Sino-American Financial Cooperation (Continued)</p>
<p>This unprecedented large loan is of great significance, far exceeding any other wartime economic assistance provided by the United States to China. Whenever Japan took detrimental actions against the Chinese National Government, the United States adopted various measures beneficial to China's resistance against Japan, such as the US$25 million loan after the fall of Hankou, the embargo on certain essential materials to Japan during the blockade of the Burma Road, and the previous US$25 million loan when Japan joined the Axis powers. This resolute assistance not only sought to offset any serious impact of Japan's recognition of the so-called "Nanjing government," but also constituted a blow against Japan's establishment of an illegitimate system, allowing Japan to monopolize advantages and exploit the equal and fair treatment long enjoyed by the United States. Secretary of State Hull said: "The fundamental policy of the United States in the Far East is to expand possible material and financial assistance to China, because China is resisting aggressive forces and continuing large-scale warfare with Japan to prevent Japan from building the so-called 'Greater East Asia New Order'." Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said: "To maintain the status quo in the Far East, it is necessary to assist China. If China can obtain sufficient economic assistance, it can establish a solid defense, thus indirectly preventing Japan from further openly damaging the interests of the United States." The words of the two gentlemen are truly "eloquent," so the significance of this loan and its impact on the overall situation in the Far East need not be reiterated!</p>
<p>Leaving aside the political implications, let us focus on the financial aspects based on the previous analysis. Regarding the credit loan portion, under mutually beneficial conditions, China is using its own resources to assist its own finances, demonstrating the strength of China's war potential, which needs no further explanation. Regarding the 50 million yuan stabilization fund, according to the financial review on September 28 concerning the third US$25 million loan: "The amount converted into British pounds is more than 6 million pounds, accounting for more than three-fifths of the amount of the Sino-British Stabilization Fund in the 28th year, and its effect on maintaining the exchange rate of Chinese legal tender will certainly surpass the strength of the 5 million pounds of assistance provided by Britain at that time." It also said: "Whether Sino-American cooperation will develop into a way to stabilize legal tender as a result of this is difficult to predict, but the United States truly hopes that China's resistance against Japan will restrain Japan's actions in the South Pacific, so we cannot say that financial cooperation is just a fantasy arising from the US$25 million provided to meet the need for foreign exchange." The so-called fantasy of financial cooperation has indeed been realized due to the United States' use of China's resistance against Japan to restrain Japan, and the assistance it has given to China is not like Britain's 5 million pounds, but a huge sum equivalent to more than 12 million pounds in British gold. Currently, China is encountering a favorable situation, such as the strengthening of the US Army's power in the Pacific, the defense talks between Britain, the United States, and Australia regarding Singapore and other Pacific areas, and now the United States is adding an equal amount of funds for stabilizing legal tender on top of the 50 million credit loan, which will obviously strengthen the stability of China's wartime monetary system and the economic power of resistance against Japan.

<h3>North-South Goods Tangerine Peel Arrives After Long Absence</h3>
<p>Tangerine peel has been out of stock for a long time, and market inventories are scarce, lasting for several months. Yesterday, it was heard that Taikoo Company's Jiangsu ship imported some. Because foreign fees have increased several times compared to before, transactions are expensive. Large ones need to increase by thirty to forty yuan to complete a transaction, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hainan Longan Persists in Not Opening</h3>
<p>Hainan longan, due to excessive arrivals, the market price had dropped by twenty to thirty yuan. However, buyers believe that the capital is not light, and mostly insist on not selling cheaply, and asking prices are higher than the original price, so the market retreats and there are no transactions. The situation still needs to persist, and it is not easy to approach, it is said.</p>
<h3>Seafood Raw Starch Rises Sharply by Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Raw starch has been rising recently due to the lack of supply. The previous market had repeatedly increased prices. The bottom inventory is gradually thinning, and high-end products are even more scarce. For example, Renqiang, SanX, and KG have already sold out. There are currently a few similar products in stock, which have risen sharply by ten yuan. Secondary flour has also increased by three to five yuan, but the increase for tertiary flour is lower, only increasing by two to three yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal Hongji No. 1 Small Size Price Falls Back After Rising</h3>
<p>Hongji No. 1 small size, previously due to the lack of goods in various industries and a certain foreign firm on Sichuan Road closing and not issuing warehouse receipts, resulting in a shortage of spot goods, the market was high. Brokers shouted a price of 270 yuan in the black market, but there were still no wholesale transactions. Recently, after the arrival of new goods, the price has fallen back slightly. Depei goods are 255 yuan, and some have been released. Haifeng small size is 210 yuan, from the warehouse by truck, with an additional handling fee.</p>

<h3>Discussion on Winter Tonic Prescriptions</h3>
<p>— Wu Keqian</p>
<p>In our country, for patients who require long-term conditioning and those who need tonics in winter, two types of prescriptions are generally adopted: tonic pastes and pills. Pills are inconvenient for women and children to swallow, and the medicinal residue is more, which hinders digestion, so tonic pastes are often preferred over pills. The combination of tonic pastes not only refines the essence and is easy to digest, but also has a sweet taste and is easy to take. In addition, there are important advantages that are not easily understood by the general public, so they are specifically highlighted for the reference of those who pay attention to winter health.</p>
<p>(1) Tonic pastes extract the effective ingredients of Chinese medicine: The variety and efficacy of Chinese medicine have been recognized worldwide. However, refining the essence has not yet become widespread, so patients who want convenience often abandon this and choose other options. However, tonic pastes are different: tonic pastes refine the essence everywhere and extract the effective ingredients. For plant-based ingredients, it is advisable to soak them for one or two nights before decocting. For those that become plump and juicy after soaking, mash and squeeze the juice and discard the residue. For those with less juice, decoct with strong heat to extract the juice. For those that are tough and resilient, decoct with gentle heat to extract the juice. For those with volatile components, boil one or two times to extract the juice and prepare the paste after decocting is complete, so that their aroma is fully retained and not lost. For those that promote menstruation and invigorate blood, decoct with wine and water first, then combine with the paste, so that it has the power to enter the blood circulation. For mineral-based ingredients, crush them finely before decocting, and then wrap them in fine silk, so that the texture is pure and fine, and they take effect immediately after entering the abdomen without causing stagnation. The same is true for substances burned into charcoal. As for those that contain animal-based ingredients, such as sheep brain, sheep kidney, beef bone marrow, pig spinal cord, mutton, and venison, each has its own method of preparation to achieve perfect effect. Therefore, the refinement of tonic pastes is the most scientific method, so that if the prescription is properly formulated, none of the dozens of ingredients are contradictory or mutually antagonistic, and all have the virtues of chief, assistant, adjuvant, and guide, then the speed of its effectiveness is far from comparable to other medicines.</p>
<p>(2) Tonic pastes condition all parts in all aspects: What our body needs are proteins, nitrogenous substances, carbohydrates, and fats, as well as vitamins present in various substances, for nutrition and growth, and to keep the cells of all parts of the body active. Even a slight deficiency can lead to illness, and excessive loss can lead to mental decline. The plant-based ingredients contained in tonic pastes not only promote metabolism and keep all parts healthy, but also often contain vitamins to supplement human needs. The minerals and carbonaceous materials commonly used in Chinese medicine often have the function of regulating the stomach and intestines and purifying the blood, and the animal-based ingredients used are mostly what modern people call organ therapy, which has the effect of strengthening the stomach and replenishing deficiencies. Whatever part needs it, it is paired with whatever substance, so it takes care of everything in all aspects and has an indescribable effect.</p>
<p>(3) Tonic pastes are combined with gelatin and are suitable for all: The combination of tonic pastes uses turtle plastron gelatin or donkey-hide gelatin and deer antler gelatin, etc., which are used to nourish yin and nourish blood or support yang, each according to its suitability, and once combined into a paste, it can be stored for a long time without spoilage. For expensive military medicinal materials such as deer velvet and deer antlers, incorporating them into the paste can be done without any loss. With patient consumption, there will be no ill effects. This is the most reasonable way to use it as a long-term tonic. It is best to dissolve a spoonful in warm water every morning, which has a small amount and a great effect. It can be taken with morning snacks, can relieve dryness and thirst, women and children can take it, and it can be used for all diseases (except for external wind-cold). It has been passed down for hundreds of years and has not declined, which is well-founded.</p>
<h3>Asthma and Its Treatment</h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>Upon entering winter, there are many more people suffering from asthma, especially the elderly. The symptom of asthma is commonly known as wheezing, and in medical books it is called phlegm-fluid asthma.</p>
<p>The elderly are weaker in qi and blood, and their physical strength is insufficient, like the power part of a machine has less power and weak propulsion. Phlegm accumulates in the lungs, and they are also unable to warm and transport it. This phlegm is cold in nature, and when spit out, it is crab-foam-like, white and foamy. When it is spit out, those that sink are all liquids. When not spit out, it gathers in the lungs and stomach, sticking together and not transforming. Over time, it accumulates more and more, and the phlegm becomes firmer and firmer, eventually forming masses. In medical terms, this is called phlegm-fluid, which lies dormant in the lungs and stomach and does not disappear year after year. The lungs lose their ability to breathe properly, and there is a constant gurgling sound of phlegm all day long, spitting out continuously. By winter, when the north wind rises, the external cold is felt, and the water has even less ability to warm and transport, and more phlegm is produced. A slight exposure to wind and cold causes coughing, and with the obstruction of phlegm-fluid, the qi mechanism is reversed, causing wheezing and gasping, and a sawing sound in the throat. During the day, the phlegm mass is still in the lower part of the lungs, but when lying down at night, the phlegm-fluid spreads flatly over the upper part of the lungs, making the gasping even more suffocating. Wheezing makes it impossible to close the eyes, and one cannot lie flat, but must pile up pillows to seek relief. If the person's kidneys are deficient, then the qi in the dantian has no ability to absorb, and the suffering is even more unbearable. All those over the age of forty often have this symptom in winter, and their illnesses are all similar to the above. The source of the illness is the decline of yang qi, the inability to warm and transport, and there is no major problem in the body.</p>
<p>The treatment for this symptom lies entirely in the method of strengthening the fire and warming the yang. Stopping wheezing, moistening the lungs, and resolving phlegm are not the fundamental treatments for this symptom. If the patient wants to alleviate their suffering, they can often take aconite and fried rice flour in autumn or early winter. Mix two ounces of aconite and eight ounces of fried rice flour (that is, ordinary fried rice ground into powder) evenly. Those with mild symptoms should finish it in thirty days, and those with severe symptoms should finish it in fourteen days. Take one portion each day, either dry or mixed with boiled water, and it will have a very good effect. (Except for young people with phlegm-fire coughs who have a history of spitting blood, this is a miraculous cure for phlegm-fluid in the elderly.) In winter, it is advisable to take medicines that strengthen and warm the yang, such as aconite, cinnamon, ginger, ephedra, and lepidium seeds, to fundamentally cure this. Otherwise, the root of the disease will deepen year by year, becoming more and more severe, which is not advisable. Therefore, the time to regulate and treat is when winter is approaching. Once curled up in bed, the power of the medicine will be slower.</p>
<h3>External Diseases in Winter</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zanchen</p>
<p>—Frostbite—When winter arrives, the weather is severely cold and the north wind is biting. Frostbite occurs on the human body in due season. The reason for this is mostly due to drastic changes in temperature, such as suddenly going from a warm room to a cold place, or using a stove to warm up immediately after cold work, or washing with hot water immediately after returning from heavy wind, rain, or snow, etc., which often leads to its occurrence. Also, like children and the elderly, those with insufficient nutrition and weak resistance, or those who like to be fashionable and wear less clothing, are prone to localized frostbite. This is because the blood feels the stimulation of cold, which continues to dissipate. Blood circulation is hindered by this, and the inner and outer membranes and skin are also damaged by this. Thus, frostbite forms abruptly.</p>
<p>Frostbite that starts in a localized area is first characterized by hot flashes, slight flushing, skin heat, subtle pain, and itching. Large ones can be divided into three stages: early, middle, and late. The first stage is the erythematous form, where the skin first appears pale, then turns cyanotic, purple, and swollen, with itching and burning. The second stage is the blister form, where the skin color is brownish-red and contains a liquid of dirty blood. If the blister ruptures, the epidermis peels off, becoming an ulcer and falling into a bad condition. The third stage is called necrosis, where the affected area is blue in color and the surrounding area is red. It hurts when cold and itches when hot. The wound is of varying depths, oozing water, and is a bad condition. In such cases, one should immediately consult a surgeon to prevent it from spreading and worsening.</p>
<p>The treatment for frostbite is to maintain the local temperature at the beginning, not making it too warm or too cold, and preventing it before it forms. If it has been lightly frostbitten, wash it with warm water several times a day, or rub the affected area with a gentle soft cloth to allow the blood to circulate and not stagnate, then it can dissipate without a trace. If it has already ruptured, then the treatment method is different from that of those that have not ruptured, because one should be warm and dispersive, and the other should be used to extract toxins and close the wound. Therefore, the treatment method after rupture must be divided into two stages. For initial rupture, use five cents of calcined gypsum, one and a half cents of cuttlebone, eight parts of indigo naturalis, and five parts of borneol, grind them together into a fine powder, and apply them with sesame oil. If the ulceration period has passed, change to using five cents of calcined gypsum, one and a half cents of stir-fried east dan, and four parts of borneol (ground into powder), mix with a little yellow petroleum jelly to form a soft paste, apply the paste on a piece of gauze, and stick it on to heal naturally, or use medicinal powder to sprinkle on dry, but all must be changed daily until it scabs over. Those in the world who are recuperating from frostbite should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>One Aspect That Young People Should Pay Attention to in Winter</h3>
<p>— Yun Shengcong</p>
<p>Young people who suffer from spermatorrhea experience more frequent nocturnal emissions in winter than usual. Upon investigating the reasons, there are several points: First, winter nights are longer than summer nights. As the saying goes, "There are many dreams every night." Many dreams are caused by not sleeping warmly, or because there is too much time and one does not want to sleep, or because the climate is severe and one falls asleep, forcing oneself into dreams, causing emissions. Second, bedding is used in winter, and warmth is always sought. Warmth covers and presses, making it easy to have more contact, which leads to hallucinations and dreams, resulting in illness. Third, there is less sweat and more urination in winter. Those with insufficient kidney qi urinate more at night, and cold air invades, unwilling to leave the bed to go to the toilet, suppressing in many ways. The bladder is full, pressing on the seminal system, causing it from internal stimulation. Fourth, due to the cold in winter, one does not get up immediately after waking up in the morning, lingering in bed and falling back asleep hazily. At this time, it is easy to develop this condition, so this condition occurs more often in the morning.</p>
<p>Based on the above reasons, those with spermatorrhea should pay attention to the following points in winter: (1) Drink less tea and water before going to bed to avoid increased urination and stimulating the seminal system. (2) The quilt covering the body should not be too heavy, and the feet should not be too warm. Some say that the feet should be exposed outside the bed, but this is not necessary. (3) When sleeping, avoid lying on your back, bend your lower foot and straighten your upper foot. (4) If you have the urge to urinate after waking up, urinate immediately and do not suppress it. (5) Whether early or late, get up immediately after waking up in the morning and do not linger in bed. Young people who are troubled by this condition should pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Common Winter Diseases</h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>Colds, chills, fever, nasal congestion, and runny nose are the most common ailments at ordinary times. During this winter season, the weather is severely cold. If clothing is not properly adjusted to the temperature, it is more likely to be affected. Generally, colds last seven or eight days, and runny noses and coughs last for half a month. Although they are minor ailments, they are often the initial symptoms of all feverish diseases (such as typhoid fever, febrile diseases, and damp-heat diseases). If the time for treatment is missed, or if it is not cured, it can easily become a chronic disease, and typhoid fever and febrile diseases can result from this. Therefore, one cannot neglect it as a minor ailment.</p>
<p>However, there are approximately three types of colds: one is a cold, which is very mild, merely a feeling of cold and wind. One is a chill, which is more severe, with a higher fever and symptoms of bone and joint pain. One is simply a fever, with no symptoms of aversion to cold. They are described in detail below:</p>
<p>(1) Cold: This is a feeling of cold and wind. When the nose is congested, there is a clear runny nose, a slight cough, body heat, a headache, and aversion to wind. The skin also has a slight gradual aversion to wind. Administer medicines that dispel wind and clear the lungs. One must wait until the cough stops as the standard. Taking medicine should not be abandoned halfway, because a slight cough remaining can easily lead to prolonged illness and damage the lungs.</p>
<p>(2) Chill: This is a feeling of cold, which is more severe than the former. The fever is steaming, there is a greater aversion to cold, no sweat, headaches, and very severe pain throughout the body or in the bones and joints. Or the neck is not very easy to turn. One must take medicines that dispel wind and cold, drink a bowl of hot water after taking the medicine, wrap oneself in a quilt, and sleep to induce sweating to heal.</p>
<p>(3) Fever: Initially, there is simply a fever, with absolutely no aversion to cold, body heat, dizziness, and pain, dry and bitter mouth, yellow tongue coating, lack of taste, and bowel movements are not very smooth. The color of the urine is red. This is the beginning of typhoid fever. If there is no aversion to cold, it is not necessary to heavily use the sweating method. One must use both dispelling and clearing the stomach and intestines. In the beginning, one can use the method of promoting bowel movements.</p>
<p>In general, most of the initial stages of all colds and fevers are of the above three types. Prescribing medicine according to the symptoms can be effective. At the beginning of winter, because the skin has not yet contracted and stabilized, it is easiest to catch a cold. Among those in the workforce, the temperature difference between the office and the home is too great, either with high-heat radiators or without heating equipment and deeply chilled to the bone, it is easiest to contract a feverish disease. It is also common for those who like to go out at night, sometimes sitting in warm rooms and sometimes venturing out into the cold wind, becoming more and more exposed to the cold, and sooner or later catching a cold or feeling ill.</p>

<h3>Inside the Blockade</h3>
<p>— Gu Rong</p>
<p>Last Saturday at three in the afternoon, as usual, I took the No. 1 public bus home, but when I arrived at Jing'an Temple, the intersection of Yuyuan Road was crowded with people. "What's going on?" "Special curfew!..." "We can't get through, what should we do?" Many people were clamoring like this. So the bus could only turn right, and I could only get off the bus involuntarily. The number of people detained at one point slowly increased, so the situation became more tense, and the noise became even more chaotic. "The last time only the cars were blocked, this time even people can't get through!" "I don't know when it will be open?" "Waiting for when! Better to go outside to have dinner, stay with relatives and friends or open a hotel." Almost everyone who was similarly affected was arguing like this. Although I was standing there calmly, I couldn't help but feel anxious and try to find a way. Finally, after having dinner at a friend's house, it was already eight o'clock, and after making more than ten phone calls to my home, I finally got through, and learned that it was open and passable. This was a welcome news, so I rushed home as fast as I could. In the alley, every household, big and small, was taking this serious issue as the center of their conversation, and everyone guessed that there might be another blockade. Sure enough, after nine o'clock, traffic was not allowed again. So the situation became tense again, but there was nothing to do, just wait quietly for tomorrow, maybe it will be open.</p>
<p>I didn't sleep well all night, and got up early in the morning to inquire about news, but the result was very disappointing. Except for foreigners, no one was allowed to pass. As a result, newspapers and letters were completely cut off. By nine or ten o'clock, the alley was crowded with people, because the iron gates on both sides were closed. Since movement was not free, at least speech was free to talk about, so I heard some students muttering: "Today is fortunately Sunday, how can I go to school!" People in the stores were complaining: "Business is ruined!" The adults of the families were worried about the issue of food, so that a few South goods stores, grocery stores, coal stores, food companies, etc., in the alley, which were unexpected, had particularly booming business. Before long, most of the stock had been sold. By the afternoon, almost everyone's greeting was "What are we eating today?" The answer was always: "Vegetarian!" There were also many young mistresses who were very good at adapting to the environment and using their time. Their idea was that since they can't go out, they might as well play mahjong for thirty-two rounds. We who are out every day, are now even more uncomfortable once we are under house arrest, we can only walk from home to the alley, and then go from the stores in the alley to the road. There are many, many people standing there, as if watching the fun. They all stay ten feet away from the barbed wire, watching the pedestrians and vehicles. When they get to the other side, they always have to "get a ticket", even foreigners.</p>
<p>Today I should go to school, but the road is blocked, so I can't go. Later, I learned that many people came out early in the morning to "negotiate", relying on the power of "Vitamin M", they were allowed to pass. Soon I got another news, knowing that from the opposite of Yuguang Village</p>
<h3>The Story of the Nunnery</h3>
<p>— Qian Jiong</p>
<p>Recently, the "business is slack" in the nunnery, which can really be described as "deserted"! Even if there are a few pilgrims, they are only "seeking dreams" and playing "flower clubs", or a few old customers with white-haired old women. The nuns are really a little unmotivated.</p>
<p>Suddenly, today a white-faced scholar came, with "Tolick" rimless glasses on his nose, wearing a suit. The nuns felt a little "different" - because men rarely set foot in the nunnery, the abbesses also considered it "a rare commodity", but, thinking about it, they always felt that such a scholar coming to be a "pilgrim" seemed inappropriate. Otherwise, did he go to the wrong "yard"? This really confused the nuns!</p>
<p>After a cup of fragrant tea, our visitor made clear his "purpose" for coming to the temple, saying that it was because of the recent "slack business" in your temple, he specially brought "good news", to transcend all the abbesses, and leave the bitter realm of Buddhism early. The reason is that there is a "organization" in Shanghai that does not recruit "married women", and as for those who have already been hired and are not married, they are slowly embarking on the "marriage" road, which makes some old men in the "organization" angry, "just trained a batch", and then have to change another batch, damn it, it's really annoying to use women!" But, they think, if they don't use women, it doesn't sound good outside, if they use women, they have to give birth to children, "not focusing on work", so they simply hire a large number of women who will "never" have children, and only the abbesses are the most suitable. Our visitor finished speaking, and touched his chin with satisfaction, took a sip of fragrant tea, and waited for the nuns' reply.</p>
<p>The nuns are naturally ecstatic, but the pity is that the nuns are not qualified enough, and they are afraid that they will not pass the exam, so the nuns also have to go to school to study, and have to submit a high school "diploma".</p>
<p>Sure enough, as expected, all those admitted were nuns, and even if the nuns were "unruly" and had a little nun in their belly, the "nun's fetus" was "legitimate"; because they had never been "married"!</p>
<p>So, all the original nuns in China were searched clean, but because the nunnery is a good place - the "preparation organization" for female employees of the "organization", so a large number of new-style modern nuns - female students, all started to open temples!</p>
<p>Therefore, there are nunneries everywhere in China, and the nun business is particularly developed! Qianjia Lane can lead to Jessfield Road, so many people went to explore like Columbus discovered a new route. Of course, we are no exception. When we arrived at Jing'an Temple, we seemed to breathe different air, but it was too late to go to school, so we bought some things and came back, and went to bed early at night, preparing to go to that road to school early tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>When I arrived at school, my classmates all asked me with surprised eyes how I got out. I told them some general things. When I was in class, I was in the classroom, but I was worried about what would happen if I was not allowed to go.</p>
<h3>"At Least"</h3>
<p>— Yu Bi</p>
<p>There was no dish for breakfast, so I wanted to buy some "candied fruit" to eat. When I took out a five-cent coin from my pocket, the clerk glanced at me contemptuously and said coldly, "At least ten cents."</p>
<p>The past is vividly in my mind. When my hometown fell and I fled to Shanghai the year before last, two or three coppers could still buy a package, but in the second half of the year it was "at least two cents"; in the first half of last year, it was changed to "at least three cents"; in the second half of the year, there was a panic of cents, and substitute coupons and stamps were rampant for a while, and it was immediately "at least five cents"; now it has jumped to "at least ten cents", the degree of rising is really amazing! "Candied fruit" is like this, what about other things, do I need to nag about it?</p>
<p>"At least", "at least", these words make people's heads ache when they see them. (Now the isolated island seems to be filled with tangible and intangible "at leasts") If we continue to "at least" like this, it will really be hard for us "at least people" who live on salaries.</p>
<h3>The Rat's Plea</h3>
<p>— Su Nong</p>
<p>"I am a rat!</p>
<p>"But don't think that I am just a rat, I live in a luxurious house (although the house is almost collapsing, the furnishings are always luxurious): what's more, the owner here is still a famous "rich old man"!</p>
<p>"But don't envy me either, there is no reason to envy me; because, the owner is rich for himself, and I am the one who is "unlucky"! You think: how can a little bit of leftover food fill my stomach.</p>
<p>"Several times I was so hungry that I went to bite the owner's table, clothes... Unfortunately: not only did the owner not "understand" me, but he was furious, and even gave all the remaining rice grains to the pug! Ate it!</p>
<p>"After being "favored", the pug "frightened" and barked. I hated it so much that I secretly bit the dog's tail...</p>
<p>"This really annoyed the owner, who didn't know where to get three stray cats, guarding my hole all day long!</p>
<p>"So even my only "freedom" was taken away, I couldn't move; my stomach was hungry again...</p>
<p>"The owner smiled all day long; the pug jumped; the stray cat barked.</p>
<p>"Help! I can't live on..."</p>
<h3>Willow of Changtai</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>The Confucian scholar listened, and his face couldn't help but change color. The smile just now disappeared immediately, and he rubbed his hands frequently, and sighed: "If so, I can't say that your words are too fierce, too sharp, making me feel like I have thorns on my back, and my heart is sad. You are indeed a strange woman, how can you be regarded as a person from Changtai? The lacquer room woman of Lu is one of your kind. Haha, do you also have the insight of Hong Fu, and can you recognize a hero like Li Yaoshuai in this turbid world? As for me, I don't just know how to escape and be famous, and ignore national affairs. In the beginning, I was in the Fushe, and I asked myself that my love for the country was no less than anyone else. Only because Wei Zhongxian stole power, loyal and good people disappeared, and the hunt for conspirators spread all over the world, the victims and those who were exiled were almost all caught in one fell swoop. The so-called gentleman's way is declining, and the villain's way is growing, this is the general trend, and also the fate of the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, we mostly hold the pain of Ai Ying, and have to think about the Jianghu, and there is no other way but to do so, and how can we not worry about the state in our hearts? You know me well, and you must be able to understand me. Why do you say this today? It really hurts my heart." After saying that, he stomped his feet and sighed again. The beautiful woman said: "How dare this little girl hurt my teacher's heart? These days, I have read some of Xie Gao's poems, and I can't control my heart, so I boldly talked nonsense in front of my teacher. All plans for saving the country and survival are best done early and first. Subsequent remedies will definitely be more difficult. Fan Zhongyan's ambition to worry before pleasure is a good example for the scholar-officials of Chu. I deeply regret that today's scholars still can't earnestly save the country. I also hate that I am a woman, and my origin is humble, and I have the will but not the power. If I could transform into a man, I would definitely do something fiercely." The Confucian scholar slammed the table and said loudly: "If so, what you said is so straightforward! You can put the men to shame! I originally admired you for your talent and knowledge, which is not like ordinary women. Today's words, how many women can say? Admire, admire, you are really a strange woman. I want to congratulate you with a glass." After saying that, he quickly picked up the wine pot, filled a glass, raised it and drank it all in one gulp. The father filled a glass in front of the beautiful woman and said: "You have to drink this glass." The beautiful woman thanked him, smiled and drank, and also drank the glass of wine. The Confucian scholar's father poured some for Jiangzi and said: "You also drink half a glass to congratulate your sister." Jiangzi smiled, picked up the glass, and drank a few sips. (4)</p>
