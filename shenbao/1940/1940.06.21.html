<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐戰變局與東方道德觀點</h3>
<p>德法兩國已經開始談判了，雖結果不可知，吾們亦很希望他們獲得接近理想的成就；在此尚無成議的時候，亦可謂延續了八個半月的西綫戰事，從此告一段落。一向象徵着自由平等博愛的法蘭西民主共和國亦將暫時收斂她的光輝，轉而與納粹與法西斯相周旋。這是現代歷史中間極關重要的轉變，世人對於力戰而屈的法國及其國民，當不吝寄與最大的同情。</p>
<p>法國經過月餘苦戰，首都淪陷，精銳盡喪，一向視若金湯的馬奇諾防綫，於主力潰敗之餘，竟失掉抵抗能力；戰而不勝，非戰之罪，法國將卒和人民，對於保衛國家是盡了最大的努力的。其最後之棄戰言和，在內在外實都有其不得已的苦衷，以是雖一面發出休戰呼聲，却仍在表示其所能接受的是光榮而非屈辱，世人當不難想像此際法國軍政當局處境的艱苦與內心的痛楚。但是法國雖陸軍主力盡喪，富鹿之區亦大部淪亡，究竟是否除却棄戰言和而外就絕無其他途徑可循，法國的光榮是否只有從事休戰纔能保持？衡以東方社會觀點的尺度，實不能不於悲憤同情之中，感覺幾許之遺憾。</p>
<p>關於戰敗降敵一點，在東方實有與西方不同的看法；西方注重現實，所以戰敗而降，是合乎邏輯的結論；東方祟尚理想，所以有寗為玉碎，矢死不屈的教條。在雙方歷史當中，也可以找到無數不同的作風。用公平的眼光來判斷，固不容驟為軒輊，但無疑東方這種作風更壯烈，更能激勵軍心民心，有時反能收轉危為安的效果。考其根源，這一方面由於東方與西方道德標準的不同，另一方面則因為封建社會與資本主義社會觀點兩相歧異。好像是William　Hazlitt說過：一從容赴死的精神以野蠻民族最為充實，文明愈高，則此種精神愈消蝕」（大意如此）。而「知其不可而為之」的精神，又是東方的特產，各大宗教的創立者都出自東方，該不是一件偶然的事。此種精神曾隨着基督教的傳播而影響到歐洲，而在古希臘所謂異教徒（Heathen）的哲人先覺和中世紀的某一些科學家當中，也間或可以看到此種氣質的存在。然而自從資本主義興起，所謂現代文化籠罩着一切以後，人們的意識不能擺脫生產關係的影響；在那種斤斤計得失，講效率，尚現實，一切都只知聽受庸俗規律支配的社會當中。理想主義者往往遭受嗤笑，崇高遠大的理想也小免被目為迂闊；因之，超人的奇蹟也就罕能見於今日的時代。這固然是在物質文明發達之後，人類力量已比較的極端縮小的結果，主要的却仍舊是社會關係使然。上决歐戰以後，共產主義與極權主義興起，稍微表現了一些精神感召的效果；即如德國此次作戰力之強銳，一部分實原於此；但其根基及其影響，比起東方國家，却尚不能等量齊觀。至於在舊資本主義較佔優勢的民治國當中，則此種類似殉道精神之更感缺乏，自屬無可諱言。</p>
<p>嚴格來說，上述種種，都應該歸納到封建道德的範疇，但這却是封建社會中光明的一面。資本主義之淘汰此種美德，曾被人當做其應受譴責的理由之一。中國正因為在歷史上封建時代所佔期間比任何國家都長，因之其浸潤於此種道德傳統也較深。成仁取義的教條，臨難母苟的垂訓，從很早已經發揮着宗教般的力量。及至宋儒，把義理之說發揚到極致，道義和節操都被推祟為人類道德的最高典型。遠如田橫五百人，張巡，許遠，文天祥，史可法一類的節烈偉績，獨在中國歷史中佔據一個極重要的地位；這些偉績，却不能求之於今日的資本主義社會。到近年，中國古老的社會體系雖已在現代文明面前逐漸崩圯，而國家多難的刺激，到使舊日的社會道德轉而與新的國家民族觀念相結合而重新興起，蔚為蓬勃深厚的偉力。在將近三年的抗戰過程中，曾有無數節烈男婦可歌可泣的故事穿揷其間，尤其是軍人，更屬壯烈可風；絕少玷辱國族的行徑，遠如吳佩孚，近如張自忠，雖其報國之道不一，却同是代表着中華民族一股正氣。昨報刊載日方某發言人推崇華軍最近在襄西作戰的氣魄，尤可明證。而中國抗戰之所以不屈不撓，堅持至今者，一部分固屬理智所形成的力量，另一部分則應富從中國歷史上的道德傳統中覓其根源。</p>
<p>這並不是強調精神可勝物質的信念，也不是一味提倡消極的道德；所謂知其不可而為之的殉道精神，有時固然僅止樹立一個可貴的模楷，未必有實際的裨益，有時却能憑着偉大決心與毅力，打破大家都視為不可抗逆的噩運。亦中國歷史上如有謝支謝石之破苻秦，虞尤文之破金主亮；西洋歷史上有如古希臘之抗波斯，羅馬之敗汗尼拔，以至近代拿破崙之驅軍渡過一向視為不可通過的阿爾卑斯山，都不是把握了勝算纔成功的。而若干科學偉人的成就，在最初往往都經過遭受腹誹譏彈甚至目為在易的階段，亦是賴其個人不屈不撓的毅力和環境苦鬥，最後纔得成功。不過在國家和政治軍事範圍之內，所關涉者既極複雜，參與的分子意志也未必齊一，在順境當中尚易保持堅定一貫的立塲，到危殆之秋則往往非單一意志所能控制；，馴至功虧一簣，為德不卒。這是最令人痛心的一件事。中國在抗戰初期也曾經歷非常艱危的關頭，結果却能以最高當局非常堅強的意志而化險為夷，步入坦途，這是中國人所最應引為光榮的一點。同時，經過此度歐陸大小國家相繼屈服之後，無疑更將令人體會中國傳統精神的偉大和可貴。</p>

<h3>蔣總裁　演辭全文</h3>
<p>重慶　（續昨）講到最近日軍</p>
<p>轟炸重慶　的情形、可以說、日人已經使盡他最大最後的力量、來向我們進攻、日人的企圖、以為我們重慶受到他這樣的威脅、即令我們政府不會動搖、人民必感受威脅、社會秩序亦將被他擾亂、從而促使我們抗戰心裡動搖、乃至於向他屈服、其目的就在此、所以他每次天盡其所有、派來重慶轟炸的飛機、少則一百十架、多則一百六十架、每一架飛機、平均至少有五個至七個人、就是他每天傾其空軍全力來侵犯重慶的人數、多到一千餘人、至少亦有七八百人、　眞是已經用到他最大而最後的力量了、而我們用來抵抗日人的空軍是如何、老實說我們每天只要用空軍中極少數的飛機、就沒有一次不是將日機　　大批擊落　或受傷、絕不使他們又一次能全隊而回的、就這幾大擊落的日機來說、每天少則兩架、多則五架、即據日人自己的廣播稱、除被擊落的以外、每次被我空軍機上的飛機、至少亦有十餘架、照空軍普通作戰學理來說、一架轟炸機至少要用三架驅逐機、方能與之作戰、而現在我們只用一架驅逐機、就要與敵軍五架以上轟炸機來鬥爭、而且我們每架驅逐機、每日要與日軍五倍以上兵力繼續到三個至六個小時的苦鬥、這就是我們空軍每次升空以後、要與日軍做五次以上的激烈戰爭、而且每次作戰以後、每一隊飛機至少有三分之二以上的飛機、皆被日機槍炮彈擊中的、甚至有一次問至開同志所駕駛的飛機、有被擊中至九十九顆槍彈、又加上一個炮彈的、此外一架飛機被中到四十顆以上子彈就不計其數了、然而我們空軍損傷程度是如何呢、說起來真是誰也不能相信、這樣奇跡、我今日可負責報告、我們空軍這兩個月作戰以來、除掉上一個月稍有幾架損失以外、自從本月以來、最近這兩周間、我們的空軍戰士沒有一個人受到有知名的重傷、也沒有一架飛機不是於忠勇的達成任務之後、安然飛返的、即如昨天日人又以一百二十餘架飛機來犯我們重慶、我們僅以極小的部隊、就打下他六架、這還是截至此刻為止已經察覺發現的來講、其他被我軍擊落在遠處的、還沒有查明和受傷的數目?尚不計算在內、所以就這幾天的戰況看起來、我們只要用很少數的空軍、就可以抵抗連日大批進犯的日機、而且每次都能夠獲得很大的戰果、我想世界上除了我們中國以外、再沒有這樣以一當十、以少勝多的空軍了、現在就這樣幾次的空襲、</p>
<p>日我死亡　的人數來計算。即過去一周中間、平均每天日機要被我擊落四架、他們費時費力所訓練出來寶貴難得的空軍人員、每天就至少要戰死二十至三十人、而我們重慶市因為防空設置的一天一天安全強固、空襲時一般防護與救護人員的努力盡職、無辜同胞之慘被炸死的、據最近一周的統計、每天自八人至四十八人、平均每天亦不過二十人、以我們普通軍民的生命與日人空軍人員之死傷數量相比較、我們所受生命的損失、比日人還少德多、而</p>
<p>物質耗損、就日人飛機汽油炸彈的耗損與我們市區房屋器具等之被炸毀、而證日人的損失、或比我們更多了、總合計之、這幾次空襲以來、我們所受的損失、絕對可以與日人的損失相抵消、而且日人空軍所蒙的損害死傷、實在超過我們在三十　以上、所以日人以空軍進犯、不僅不能撼動我們的毫未、而且是得不到償失、徒然自速敗亡、即此一端、就可以使日人知道、要用他空軍的力量來威脅制服我們的政府和人民、是無異於舉挺擊空、徒　夢想而已、而我們一般同志和全國軍民、如果都能拿這幾天我空軍以少勝多的精神來抗戰、來建國、來辦理政治、發展經濟、從事各種社會事業、人人都能如我們空軍戰士一樣、能用一個人的力量來對抗三十個乃至一百個以上的日人、那末無論日人如何用盡他最後所有的力量、以圖一逞、也沒有不被我們消滅的、我們決沒有不能獲得最後勝利的、其次在此次空襲期間、除空軍人員能忠勇奮發、確實　成他任務之外其他黨政軍警、以及青年圖和社會各方面組織之空襲服務隊、防護團、救護隊、消防隊、交通隊、　兵警察、以至僧俗但　隊、大都皆能發揮</p>
<p>忠勇犧牲　的精神、盡到本身的職責和義務、這是本席覺得非常安慰的一點、可以說是我們抗戰史上最光榮的一頁、在今天、我們的勝利、愈益接近、快刀成功的時候、我們黨政軍警會各方面的同胞、都能如此愈戰愈強、牡蠣奮勇、我們是在可以自信不僅日人必掃潰敗、就是世界上任何國家、亦必瞭然於中國之政府和任林決非任何力量所能威脅、我們現在所有力量是在還沒有全部發揮出來、尤其是各院部廳處高級幹部、更要格外</p>
<p>勉努力、　來盡到各位自己的責任、要知道我們個人能力之長短、國家力量之強弱、就是要在這種危險時期和非常情況下、體驗出來、所以時機愈危急、黃精愈險惡、我們的精神要愈　奮、工作要愈緊張、但是現在尚有少數機關、似乎可以鬆懈一點、而對於低級人員的工作、更不去檢點督查、這就完全錯誤了、我們空軍和救護人員、冒死不顧、用血肉來保障我們的安全、來救濟我們民衆的苦難、如果我們各機關負責同志、尤其是各院部會高級官史、還不能盡忠竭力、利用時間、加緊工作切實指揮督促下屬員、在這個危險時期來發揮他們的才力、那就是有　職守、不配作現代機關的主官了、要知道從前亡清、一般公務人員之所以成爲亡國官僚、就是因爲他們不能臨危鎮定、一遇危急、就心裡動搖、秩序紛亂、甚至棄職先逃、所以成爲亡國的政府、我們革命政府的官史、是要能淬勵精神、努力奮鬥、希望各位負責同志、千萬不要錯過這個磨練智識、創造功業的時機、雖在日機狂炸之下、更要能運用時機、發揮能力、以身作則、　率部屬提高我們的工作效能、增強我們國家的力量、各院部主官、以後在抗戰期間一切事業、只要與我們的職務有關、不待下級機關、衛戌總部、市政府或公安局的請求、我們各位主管、都要自動的來盡心計劃、盡力協助諸如救濟、交通、市塲等、都要我們主管官自動的研究、盡力的處理解決、來把握住這　實行三民主義、救國救民的好機會、尤其是行政院、軍委會、各部會主官、更要辨別　　、加倍振作來推進我們的業務、不好使我們的革命精神、因日機的兇熖、面稱有鬆弛、日人以爲經此轟炸、我們必感受恐慌動搖、但他嫩炸毀我們的房屋薄瓦、決不能動搖我們抗戰的精神、現在即令我們辦公約房舍有被日機炸毀的、但藉此更可振奮我們的生命精神、加緊我們抗戰的工作、我們國民政府廳舍、雖被日機炸毀、但我們今日仍是　在國民政府哇碟之中、來舉行我們總理擴大紀念週、即令將來全市區、都被日機完全粉碎、變成灰　、我們國民政府亦在此地、舉行一切會議、我們正要用鲜血和烈火來鍛煉我們民族的智能、滋長我們多見民族的生力、這樣我們的革命繼能完成、我們中華民族繼能永遠立於堅忍不拔獨立自強的地位、（未完待續）</p>
<h3>日機襲渝　得不償失</h3>
<p>重慶　華方官員今日聲稱、日本飛機每次空襲渝城、須耗費日金四千萬元、而今夏空襲！所予中國政府及軍事設備之損失極微、今年日機襲渝規模較中日戰事爆發後任何時爲大、但日機所炸毀者、大半爲華西土著之古舊及建築惡劣之民房　已、此種損失、使日本得不償失、中國政府機關及工廠、均散處重慶郊外、並未受日機轟炸之損失、工廠已由行都　往深洞、非日本飛機炸彈所能擲到、除民房及商店損失外、今年日機擲彈炸毀渝城外國財產、渝城郊外之法國聖保羅天主教堂及教堂所辦女學、星期日完全被機炸毀、，美國人所辦之基督復臨安息日即美以美會被震毀、　未修復、，美國人所辦之冰廠因星期日被炸損毀、本星期被迫停工、加拿大教會之事　所被震毀、德人財產、包括　通社及德國沃　孚鋼鐵廠、蘇聯渝大使館及塔斯社、均被毀、中國政府獲得云　日、　襲渝教訓後、故得　　　準備今夏之空襲、在日機　襲時、仍侵　續辦公、不全　斷、渝民十氣、並不因日機轟炸稍受　響、大部人民、頁已撤離、剩留者　　嚴洞中避難、渝城人民已過慣「轟炸生活、」本年人民死傷減少、　證明防空之有效、華方官員估計、日機每次空襲渝城、耗廢日金四千萬元、該項數字係就飛機損失、駕駛員死亡汽油及炸彈消耗估計之、該項數字係根據一百架飛機計算之、但本年日機襲渝時、辄逾一百架、華方軍官估計日機每次襲渝、需汽油七萬加倫、計日金廿一萬元、日機所擲炸彈、值美金廿萬元。每次空襲、日機平均損失五架、沒架值美金卅萬元、除上述損失美金三千萬元外、日本駕駛員死亡之練員其他費用、合計美金一千萬元、本年四月起、日機襲渝平均一百六十架、較去年多三架、（廿日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　華空軍頃宣稱、自五月廿日至六月十六日止、日機共襲重慶十二次、空襲之日機、被華方擊落者共有二十九架、此外尚有四十架、聞亦被擊落、惟該項飛機擲殘骸已不能覓得、日方之航空員、襲命者有二百零三人、受傷機中載有日航空員七人、　此十二次空襲、日人損失美金一百十萬零三百元、而中國則損失美金四十萬零八千元、中國之驅逐機、僅四架被擊落、九架受損、（廿日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>各國駐軍決不撤退　滬租界保持現狀　自由市建議遭各方抨擊　外傳謠琢均無置信價值</h3>
<p>本埠因受歐戰擴大影響、一部份僅圖私利、不顧大局者、舊調重彈、竟有所調「自由市」之建讓、此項計劃、已由領事團討論之說、實則此種想入非非之私人計劃、領事團根本無加以討論或考慮之理、公共租界當局方面之消息、領事團及工部局、並未獲知有此事、又據接近法租界方面表示、亦謂法租界當局從未知悉上海租界有改設「自由市」之醖釀、此外與上海有權益關係之各駐滬外交當局、亦認此為一種私人擬議、上海外交界方面並無有此關於所謂「自由市」任何涉或接觸、且信項計劃、決難成為事實、蓋以有關變更中國領土主權，非中國政府所能承認。</p>
<p>各國防軍照常留駐</p>
<p>僞市長傅筱庵、在某方　動之下、前日兌分函炎法義駐滬各國領事、要求撤退駐滬防軍、昨據本埠外籍外交當局談、英法兩國駐滬防軍、均照當留駐、決不撤退、蓋本埠英法義二國防軍　經出美國亞洲艦隊司令赫德大將之斡旋努力、決定共維現狀、凡足以引　摩擦之事端、均已規定、盡其方法、力事避免、故事實上殊無撤退之理由、</p>
<p>英領表示無權研究</p>
<p>本埠英國總領事喬治、昨日表示、關於「市長」傅筱庵分致英法義三國領事要求撤退駐軍之公函、渠迄术過目、傅氏之函、係用華文繕成、渠尙未囑令譯員譯成英文、渠所知者、係得自報紙、但無論如何、對於撤軍一事、渠實無任何權力可言、喬氏謂任何國籍之軍隊、由兩租界撤退、此一問題、須由各該國政府當局決定之、而非領事所能越組代庖也、</p>
<p>華方駁斥設自由市</p>
<p>關於設立「上海自由市」之建議、於報端揭露後、各方已就其絕無可能之點、加以指斥、其重要者、此舉足以妨害中國領土主權之完整、中國政府絕難同意、權之完整、中國政府絕難同意、蓋租界之法律地位、與「借地」迴乎不同、正確言之、實僅為各國外　之「居留區」、主權固仍屬中國、此其一、次之、即就租界現狀而論、中立性既經確定自不必多此一舉、事實尤少可能、領事　方面、昨日又復指出此項計劃、毫無價值、現在領袖領事之義大利總領尼隆氏、對於此事、則以環境關係、不願發表意見、</p>
<p>法租界內安靜如常</p>
<p>自日方對安南方面之野心暴露以後，華南海面之形勢、突趨緊張、而在本埠方面對於法租界上亦頗多搖諑、實則毫無根據、而僞方之虛張聲勢、確為造成此種謠言之重要因素、至於法租界境風情形、據平明社記者向接近當局方面探詢結果據稱、「法租界內一切如常、外間流言、不足置信」、更有傳僞軍集結近郊一帶、據向來自西郊之華人方面、探詢所知、租界以外、早有僞軍、其在南市謹記橋以南之日軍坦克車十餘輛、在華軍撤離以來所常見、外傳種種、實屬神經過敏、無異庸人自擾、</p>
<p>徐家匯區誤會事件</p>

<p>交還卷宗無此可能</p>
<p>據工部局高級職員發表意見稱、局方對於傳筱庵要求交還土地局卷宗之事、將感覺若干困難、因此等宗卷、由中國政府交託保管、而今之所謂「市政」、則未得任何國家之正式承認也、一般所注意者、則以為日本對於此案、必不甘置身事外、而足為妨礙上海和平與秩序之可能原因、該「市長」最近在接見西報記者時所發表之意見、謂工部局之所以不肯交出土地局宗卷、乃因保護若干外籍商人之故、蓋此輩外協、在滬戰期間、曾代華人產業出面探悉、此案現正由本埠各外國領事加以討論、其中多人不贊成目下即將土地宗卷交出、</p>

<p>本市英商怡和洋行裕生輪、原定昨晨駛往香港海防、業經售出之海防客票、並裝往海防貨物、詎前晨突接海防分行電告封銷消息、故即辦理退票手續、運往海防貨物亦經退關、準備停駛海防、將俟抵港後、再行決定云、又該公司之明生輪定二十六日離滬、亦將暫時駛港、至太古洋行濟南輪、於十九日出口、能否抵達海防、亦須全港至港後始可決定、又訊、昨據香港方面消息、港越航線、因海防封銷撤消、已於前晚（十九日）起復航、但本市航業界、昨日尙未接到上項消息、確否待證、</p>
<p>西南郵遞無虞中斷</p>
<p>至滬越間郵遞、前昨曾因輪船停駛、而告中斷、查海防原為上海與滇川等地往返郵件之重要轉遞口岸、目前普通信　則仍照常封發、惟該局於必要時可將運往內地郵件改取道浙東、裝浙贛鐵路運往至贛·湘·鄂·滇·黔·川等省寄遞、亦極便捷、需時與經海防者相若、故上海與西南各地之郵遞、絕無中斷之虞、</p>
<p>海防經轉包裹暫停</p>
<p>上海郵政管理局包裹股通知單第二〇八號云、查停收雲南及其上各地大宗包裹及大宗小包郵件、業經第二〇二號包裹通知單通知在案、茲因運輸困難、所有寄往海防國轉之雲南及其以上各地之各項包裹及各項小包郵件統應暫停收寄、</p>

<p>公共租界及法租界日用品物價平準委員會、現決定設立聯絡機關、俾採取合作辦法、平抑物價、已由皮德遞博士開始籌備、擬具組織章程、呈請工部局核准實行、</p>
<p>通力合作平抑物價</p>
<p>工部局副總辦葛勃氏、前日對西報記者稱、工部局現已組設一國際性之機關、專事調查市場中之物價、及調查租界內之米價、據工部局公告稱、該機關將與法租界物價平準會合作、以取締商人投機謀利等情事、出衛生處皮德遜氏主持、</p>
<p>添用人員開始辦公</p>
<p>但該機關對物價所調查之結果、是否將被作為統制物價之標準、　前則尙未決定、其責職乃在將現有物價之情形、調查清楚、作一明顯之圖表、而為工部局抑平物價之參考、該機關內並有日籍職員一人、為專負與日方交涉關於食糧進口問題、另有華籍職員一人、專負與華方交涉此種問題、該新機構現已在工部局大廈內開始辦公矣、</p>
<p>法平價會視察米棧</p>
<p>本月十九日、法租界平價委員會及法捕房、各派有代表、前往法租界內多家米店及米棧視察、各代表封於米糧成本價值、及購進價值各文件、經加考查、而尤注重於投機情事、凡過有米糧賣價、不適合於成本價值　及購進價值時、經即進行核查、現並由米糧小組委員會覓求改良米市之辦法、</p>
<p>米價狂漲應鄧澈究</p>
<p>據金融界消息、上週訂購洋米在八千頓、六月份內共購洋米約二萬頓、（每頓十公擔）、而一月至五月進口之洋米共一·六七四·六一〇公擔、米源向甚湧旺、即一時發生運輸困難、決不致影響市價、況泰國緬甸來源暢通、而外匯又放長、內地粳米、亦有運到、更無狂漲之理、尙望當局對連日米市一漲冉漲消形、嚴予澈究、以維民食、</p>

<p>在商討中</p>
<p>並非已核定正式宣佈、所有各難民食糧決維持至本月底終止、一俟善後委員會通過該項發給各難民恩糧多寡後、即當通知總辦事處照辦、至難區之將來、各界對之至為關懷、茲據探悉、該區雖收容之難胞迅即遺散、但難區地位決不變更現狀、因饒神父創立該區之意、乃係設立安全區、難區之名、不地滬埠人士習慣上之稱呼、當時中日兩方、均係同意、故該區將來地位如何、可不致更變也、</p>

<p>昨晨、米行茶會市場循例於七時半開做、一般投機米蠢、竟藉口香港禁止米糧出口、洋米來源、行將中斷、　將現貨不肯輕易脫手、並入心堅定、以訛傳訛、流言繁多、結果粳秈米價空前暴漲、較諸前市竟漲起五六元之鉅、市場管理委員會除嚴密注意市況外、一面即遣派人員監視在場同業買賣、制止非法交易、然一時人心終難安定、不得已將市場提早停市、</p>
<p>洋米來源無虞中斷</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、關於香港之禁止米糧出口、僅係一部分、凡領有執照米商、仍可運米出口、並據外傳、滬防航行、業已恢復、故國外洋米來源、決無中斷這虞、況滬市各堆棧存米、亦甚充實、按日市場買賣各貨、與每日國外市價、顯無關係、昨晨米價之暴騰、顯係投機米蠢所致、昨據米業界消息、即使海防正式封銷、　　等地來源仍可　抵、僅時間上稍行延長而　、</p>

<h3>糧食眞要餓死人　米一漲六七元　結果雖回小……然仍然見上漲四五元　海防仍可運……新定况以暹米為多　若照昨日價……三升米要兩元</h3>
<p>米市一味放任、不加管制、遂使大衆生活所需、成為投機利器、昨日漲風之盛、竟打破歷來紀錄、發現意外之高價、無論明黑市、悉猛飛六七元之巨、各色洋米價、除碎米米茶外、均已穿出六十元大關、若一號陳西貢曾至六十六元、且聞各色厚薄粳塲外暗盤、亦皆超越七十元大關、常帮特清粳達七十五元、此種不幸之局面、完全由投機壟斷米商借海防封鎖之傳說、及香港限制出境之風聞、左進右出、欲縱先收、鬧得市塲人心惶惶、天翻地覆、嚇得一般內地浙紹等帮及鄉莊客戶驚惶不定、晨間初開、即已紛紛出手、羣相爭辦、竟不問價格之貴賤、貨品之優劣、祇求拉得手中、似已喜出望外、於是造成懷貨者信口開河之良機、一喊數元、況兼投機家冉從中施操縱之故技、大打出手、盲目者不辨皂白、跟踪附和、遂一路在跳、迄中市混亂更難　喻、而售價飛騰、開出未有之高價、一號陳四貢達六十六元、二號六十三元七角、六十三元半、火絞六十四元半、六十四元、　號暹羅六十五六元、二號六　三元半、小紋銀行棧六十二元半、浦東棧六十二元、東京砶尖六十二元、而混合碎及米菉並駕齊驅　高碎自五十五元次至五十三元、菉五十匕八元、際此一般實銷方始停手、而浮囤即亦乘高出籠、乃市面急轉直下、當時反響　烈、倐忽瀉落二元有奇、若小絞銀棧已祇開六十元零五角、浦棧六十元、詎意售價方低、突又引起客囤之吸收、頃刻形勢復活、各價冉度回昂一元、結果牧盤行情、小絞又至六十一元半、六十一元、較之前日上午收價計暴漲六元之砠、比之前日午後提增四元左右、中因慎記拋出今日到埠七百五十噸二號西貢價七十三元、故有一度回落、午後及晚父經過數度升降、給果二號西貢及暹米均自六十四元小至六十三元二三角收市、小絞自六十三元小至六十二元四角、比之前晚仍有較大四五元、回籠原包小絞六十四元、西　號六十八元、　　上午開六　　元至六十五元九角半、下午開十八裝六十七八元、二十六日裝六十六元、各漲四五元不一，封鎖中斷各謠均已證實不　、近晚西貢來電該地照常卸裝、惟船隻確已減少、然暹羅來源、並未受有影響、且本市所　暹羅巳不在少云、</p>
<p>洋米昨日又到一萬　千六百五十包、係怡和洋行利生輪自香港運來、停靠法租界羅斯福碼頭、昨晚已開始起卸、聞今日有三千包運往福建、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、際此環境、旣受同樣之激盪、傳聞粳米塲外暗盤、遂亦相互牽引、奔騰異常、且形勢尤較他貨為俏、常帮特清粳、最高自七十五元低至七十四元、蘇崑常州白粳七十三四無、次至宿熱者七十元、靑泗特薄稻七十二三元、中關七十一元、南港早晚稻七十元六十九元、糯米以價廉物美大受垂靑、若金溧特元、市上已開至六十元大關、即如常丹貨亦須五十八九元、江北元五十七元左右、統計粳糯兩者一律銳增五六元、而到貨共有一千三四百包抵埠、店莊門售一號西貢五十九元、糯米之貴半由於近來洋米之中、多攙糯米、聞浙西某地早已糯米與冬霜米對搭出售突、</p>
<h3>粉與米巿亦步亦趨　昨又堅守望不出</h3>
<p>粉市依然暗堅、查二號粉廠盤、仍為十三元八角、各廠為維持本街起見、祇限零星實銷、未能儘量供給、南北客銷亦然、統市成交的有一萬餘包、聞南洋帮以越南形勢突吿緊張、香港運輸問題、恐發生阻礙、反而不敢進取、但昨日因有香港禁米出口消息、米價暴騰、粉價地位、又加一層堅強、是以老車棧單及內地粉早已堅守不出、市面前途、自屬易漲而跌難、二十日有粉五千包、二十一日又有一萬五千包、同運福建、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市慘瀉百餘元　雙馬新低價見九百五十元</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、跌風在熾、此因南海不靖、香港至海防航運綫發生阻碍、對於貨物暫將止裝所以廣帮束手觀望、棉紗隻包未辦、人心由此大受打擊、一般浮多心虛斬結、所以外滙雖縮、市面毫無影響、紗價乃直綫下瀉、二十支雙馬再現新低價、為九百五十元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因報海防封鎖、人氣惶恐、賣者尤踴、二十支雙馬價為一千〇五十元、旋漲至一千〇六十元、一霎間賣戶接踵而來、市盤越做越小、直破千元關口、收盤價為九百七十二元、查半日問成交統計一千七百三十包、行情二十支雙馬跌一百三十五元、今日有紗四百二十件運香港、二百二十五件運威海衛、四十五件運天津、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、四六〇　寗波　二七〇　統計　一、七三〇</p>
<h3>紗即不穩棉市愈殭</h3>
<p>本棉交易杜絕、此因紗市不移、且一落千丈、二十支雙馬紗又發現半年以來之新低峰、於是廠家需要更清、至於同業中大家肚皮吃得飽滿、處於目前環境之下、更無心意營業、所以事實上遂呈殭持之局也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、細紗棉市、晨初開盤即因投機者之購買而漲、後又因華爾街之在市購買結果收盤價格、較之上日漲十餘磅音、印度連力預測跌五羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、市盛傳怡和輪已中止開往海防、故紗價慘落、但匯兌殊緊原棉價格反見增責、然交易殊為清淡、竟成死市、海外棉市、步漲終未能刺激人心也、</p>
<h3>證券　內債風平浪靜　外股略形軟化</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市仍極安定、惟仍係跌多漲少、市塲亳無興奮、亦乏頹喪氣象、查自八一三以後上海各銀行所有之各種公債、大多數已運向內地備藏、所以市塲籌碼祇有此數、比從前减少數額甚鉅、河面窄狹、波浪自微、更自　三年來經過種種謠言及危險、均巳化險為夷、安然渡過、故做多者胆氣較壯、祇以吃息過高、倘市價即使不跌、常此盤旋、做多者巳吃虧不少、放空者即利用此點、更使市價受到壓迫、現在第九期利息行將到期、祇需無意外謠言、市價小久當仍上翔、但為數亦必有限、昨日久豐全日補進、而大通父全日賣出、四號十二號及三十八號均　出脫、鴻康鴻　聯益等雖有買進、市價仍未能提高、盤旋結果、除　種已四日未能做開外、餘則小一角左右獨戊種回好五分、成交總數約六十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交浙江與業股十二股、價為七十七元五魚、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨日股市、略形軟化、蓋浮多之了結者綦衆、價格無甚　化、祇怡和股內紗價下瀉、較開盤時跌落兩元、橡皮股仍被忽視、略有補空活動、</p>
<p>倫　十九日（週三）電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛脾行市、銀行股續吿疲落、麥加利銀行股跌二先令六便士、價為七鎊七先令六便士、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股跌四鎊、價為七十鎊、香港註冊股跌三鎊、價為七十五鎊、其餘不動、</p>

<p>投機商主要賣戶</p>
<p>午後為狀趨鬆、乃投機家有出無進、扒戶較少、初投機商賣出、由華外行吸入、本月份美滙五元七五至七八一二五、後某華行亦曾吐出七月份美滙五九六二五、投機家續有售出　迨至晚收、仍吿硬化、結果英金三辦士九三七五、美滙五元七八一二五、本月份與現貨同價、七月份英金三辦士八七五、美滙五元五九三七五、較之上日晚收、現貨英微鬆〇三一二五、美則仍平、七月份英美各緊〇六二五、</p>

<h3>外幣始漲繼跌</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤漲而復跌、英美金鎊因亦漲後轉跌、英金票忽有供給、市價突跌、美金票始則買氣甚旺、一度高至十七元七角三分、但未幾即吿步落、午間退為十七元四角、午後賣氣益盛、晚市退為十七元一角半、比上日軋跌二角、香港票仍不乏供給、市價續跌一分、日金票及朝鮮票均稍有需要、市價一致微漲、前者為一元零八分半、後者為九角五分半、</p>
<h3>多頭乘高出籠　金價大漲大落　午前最高見五千九百元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、虎頭蛇尾、高價立足不穩、步步回落、疲風不振、蓋一般乘貴拋空者、本日最夥、雖各帮居間力吸、終以賣方聲勢較大、籌碼相當寬裕、而午後又傳利空消息、人心愈弱、至晨初因匯市報緊、而錢兌業銀號開後力搶、兩度達五千九百元、嗣某金號一再拋空、且浮多俱來賣出、價壓住小起、午收僅五千七百七十五元、午後初況尚定、奈多戶出籠未竟、雖某金號乘機獲利補空、但仍感懸絕、一度又退至五千六百五十元、惟結果為五千六百八十元收盤、較上日軋落穴十元、全天交易的四千兩有餘、銀樓飾金先漲後跌、終則反小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤回跌六十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以外滙報軟、人心堅奮、開時買者競扒、遂橫跳一百四十元、錢兌業進金號二十兩、為五千八百八十元、繼因錢兌業仍買、而斯時銀號亦吸、再高二十元、錢兌業進某金號五十兩、為五千九百元、嗣某金號突見高拋空、力塞數百雨、加之證券幫亦售、遂回落七十元、錢兌業出銀號二十兩、為五千八百三十元、旋因滙市依然吿緊、銀號帮多頭猛烈加碼、且一時售者轉少、復又飛躍七十元、重見五千九百元高價、奈外匯忽吿回硬、金號重來猛塞、兼現金號亦來沽出、而一般多戶見景跟賣、迨午刻竟回降至五千八百元關內、銀號出金號二十兩、為五千七百五十元、收盤前銀號稍撈、略抬二十五元、銀號進證券帮三十兩、為五千七百七十五元、作午牧價、午後首由錢兌業進銀號三十兩、為五千七百八十元、不意此後賣者接踵、因外滙報鬆、銀號帮多頭先後出籠、現金號及錢兌業亦互相吐售、雖其間金號絡續補空、但頭寸仍感充斥、不久暴落一百三十元、銀號出金號十兩、為五干六百五十元、入後賣風稍息、某銀號重來做多、遂吿回升三十元、銀號互做三十兩、為五千六百八十元作晚收價、結果比上日回跌六十元、全天二百五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十攻元、收進減低二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>

<p>耳為黑木耳中之最大朵、通來原貨絕無運到、行方惟由四川耳中篩出之面張、以供市需、故售價高昂、昨市售五百元、與統貨相差二百元云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　浮囤傾向賣出　期貨全無做開</h3>

<h3>拔齒笑談</h3>
<p>英國派駐埃及國開魯之領事，一日，以事見埃及大王，時王方病齒，腮腫如瓜，滿口皆塞藥棉，哼聲不絕。領事安慰畢，即曰：「大王何不將牙拔去，以為斬草除根之計。」王舉首問曰：「不痛乎？」領事曰：「醫士先用迷藥，故拔時雖痛，毫不知覺。」王躊躇少頃，見牙科，隨命入見，王略壯膽，問答片刻，忽有驚懼之色！即曰：「君等言拔牙不痛，事有可疑，必先命他人試之，然後可。」即召一兵入，賞以銀錢，為述其事，兵從之，王乃留心察看，命取兵口中同王疼處之牙。牙科遂將兵按椅上，王立其旁觀看，見醫將迷藥用畢，取鉗拔其大牙而出，毫不知覺，王喜動顏色曰：「妙妙！」命左右賞兵以酒使去，遂坐椅上使拔。醫生方欲用藥，王忽又大驚，面色灰敗，急躍起連聲曰：「不妙！不妙！兵年輕而力壯，我年邁身弱，恐不能勝。」又從宮中喚出一弱女，今試拔之，果亦無所苦楚，王始又放膽坐下，令拔出其牙云。</p>

<p>謠言是怎樣發生的？第一，一個謠言的由來，都跟隨着一種目的，不是有利於己，便是有損於人，但是要獲得效力，在製造謠言之外，先要認清對方，所謂攻之以弱點，謠言之計始能得售。譬如一個孩子啼哭的時候，做媽媽喊着老虎來了，媽媽所以不喊小咪而喊老虎，是因為孩子怕老虎。孩子怕老虎，這就是孩子的弱點。可是這弱點還不足病，因為媽媽雖喊着老虎，來的還是小咪。然而老虎的謠言終究能夠騙過孩子者，是為了孩子太「輕信」謠言，他聽見了老虎，既沒有看清楚纏繞在脚跟前的小咪。於是謠言源源發生，製造謠言者也源源得計。</p>
<p>那末怎樣攻擊謠言？我們往往「以事實來證明」。其實是謠言，何必「等」事實來證明呢？在等事實來證明之先，製造謠言者已經在這剎那間的機會中獲得利益了。投機市塲中的瞬息萬變，就利用不斷的「謠言」，使「事實一始終追隨不上。</p>
<p>所以，當一個謠言來到你面前的時候，應該憑銳利的目光，理智的斷判，及敏捷的行動去撲滅它。譬如突然有人喊着隔鄰失火了，先要辨清楚喊失火的是誰，不要是街頭的頑童？隔鄰是什麽建築，鋼骨水泥與茅草棚有很大的區別。再立即跳上曬台看看是左鄰或右鄰，風勢與火災也有聯帶關係。如此，假使眞是失火，再收拾細軟不遲。吾則，大哭小喊，手忙脚亂，搶了枕頭逃到街上去，豈不笑死了街頭的頑童？</p>
<h3>「有死無生」　—錄一個財徒的警世語</h3>
<p>— 盲博士</p>
<p>自歹土」的所謂「俱樂部」與什麽園開設以來，各報的本埠新聞欄里頻添不少侵佔，捲逃，與自殺的案件，就是各種副刊上，也常常有「賭的懺悔」，「賭徒的臨死哀嗚」等一類文字。照理，報上旣有這許多觸目驚心文字看見，睹徒應該減少了，因賭而發生的小幸事件，應該沒有了。然而說也傷心，賭徒還是那麼多，最近我的老及忻君，也幾乎因此而毀滅了一切。幸而他覺悟尚早，雖輸去二千七百元，未釀成他種不幸。不過他經此一番挫折，發奮要將一般人所以陷身賭窟的「動機」囑我寫出來，以為後之炯戒！</p>
<p>他說：賭徒並不是不知道睹窟就是魔窟，但所以常常有人會去葬送者：（一）是好奇，想去見識見識。（二）是貧小，想跟着去揩些油。（三）　於交友不慎，日久便與同化。（四）出於平日不知節儉，一旦虧空，無法彌補，遂去作孤注一擲。今欲避免此等不幸，祇有實行不好奇，不食小，慎交游，尚節儉。總而言之，他們的設備無論怎樣精美，享用無論怎樣舒適，侍應無論怎樣周到，你總不要去想它，不想吃他的白食。再說得透澈點，他那麼大的開銷，如果不靠賭徒送錢進去，它們怎樣「立足」的？還有一點，你即使不想吃白食，不想贏錢，而僅是偶一　遊戲參觀，那也是很危險的　因為一到里自，眞是奇怪，你原來的主意沒有了，我使是因參觀而陷入賭窟的一個。</p>
<p>此外，交朋友亦須生眼睛，愛賭朋友絕對不可交，如舊及中巳有嗜賭者，你除了盡友誼規勸之外，絕不可輕動情感。一動情感，自然也要亦步亦趨了。</p>
<p>節儉，本為吾人立身處世之堡壘，如果平時省吃儉用，不浪費，那雖不必說「有餘」，但至少亦可衣食無虞，衣食既無虞，則一切冒險的僥倖心，便不會產生。曾見許　因賭而致自殺的朋及，除上述數種原因陷入賭的陷阱外，往往因貪吃濫用，狎邪遊蕩，弄得入不敷出，債臺高築，無法彌補，遂打花會，上俱樂部」，入什麼園，以冀僥悻成功。結果財神（？）不幫你的忙，負債益鉅，無顏見人，祇好自戕生命了。</p>
<p>螻蟻尚且惜生，我們何必為了賭而自殺呢？！所以我要奉勸一般不賭的人，始終站定脚跟，信守上述四點，免蹈前人的覆轍。已賭的人，雖輸去很參的錢，亦譬如生了一塲大病，不必再想去翻本，因為不想翻本，雖大病之後，元氣斷傷，然而還能夠漸漸復元。要是死小「領盆」，再沉迷下去，我可以肯定說一句：「有死無生」</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第二章　「一頁往史！」</p>
<p>他說時他的眼光瞧着書桌邊上的那枚廉價烟嘴。「我的臥室在三層樓，就在金梅的隔室。我睡到床上不久，便睡着了，直到被槍聲驚醒，才知巳過半夜。」</p>
<p>「你怎樣知道這個時間？」</p>
<p>一我聽得了槍聲，還是迷迷糊糊，以為是什麽黃包車胎的爆裂，因為我巳聽得過幾次了。可是不多一回，金梅已念促地來敲我的房門。我才爬起來，看看妝檯上的小鐘，已是十二點二十分。我就跟着伊下來，一走進　裹，便瞧見麗蘭這個樣子。那時眞幾乎把我嚇死！」他說到這裏，語聲有些顫慄，那雙有神的黑眼睛裹也漏出驚異的光彩。</p>
<p>霍桑問道：「你可知道你的內姪女昨夜什麼時候回來的？」</p>
<p>那老頭兒搖搖頭，，「不知道。伊每夜回家，最早總在半夜，有時甚至全夜不歸。」</p>
<p>「往日裏伊回來的時間，你是知道的嗎？」</p>
<p>「也並不。有時候我偶然醒着，聽得伊開門進來的聲響。如果我在睡熟的當兒，那就聽不見。我巳說過，我住在三層樓上。」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭又問道：「那末，除你以外，那兩個僕人可知道伊昨夜回來的時間？」</p>
<p>李芝範躊躇了一下，答道：一我也不知道。我不曾問過他們。不過據金梅說，伊也沒有聽得麗蘭回來。我們下樓時，大門却沒有鎖。」</p>
<p>倪金壽忽揷口說：「我想那看門的老毛總知道的。要不要叫他馬上進來！」</p>
<p>霍桑搖搖頭。「等一等，我還有幾句話要問季先生。」他摸出紙烟盒來，敬了一支給那老頭兒，自己也燒着了。「李先生，我們為偵查這件案子的眞相起見，不能不注意到各方面。現在有一句關於你內姪女的私生活的話，希望你能夠據實答覆。」（二一）</p>
<h3>寄信</h3>
<p>— 龔光照</p>
<p>我為了寄一對航空信，親自到郵局裏買郵票，剛走到郵局，我看見買郵票的人非常多，我想等買郵票人少一點才過去買，我就靠在掛號　看他們發信。忽然，一個人拍拍我底背脊，「先生，你寄航空信嗎？」他顯然看到了我手裏捏着上面貼了航空籤條的信。我點點頭。「先生，買好的郵票不能退，眞討厭！我本來買兩張三角郵票預備寄航空信的，一封寄天津，一對寄　港。」那人滔滔不絕地說。「香港沒有航空綫的。」我吿訴他。「是的，就為着這，現在有三角郵票用不着，退又退不了，先生，你寄航空信，帮帮忙替我用了吧。」他求助似地看着我。我看着他非常的可憐，就答應了他底請求。但當我打算搽了漿糊把郵票貼到信上去，那知郵票翻過以後一個大的秘密給我發現了。在郵票的背面有紅的水漬，正面呢，有細微的黑影，兩個明顯的證據給我發現，那是一張用過的郵票。那個人呢，早已逃跑了，我自認晦氣再買了一張郵票。在怱忙及刺用人家的同情心，這種騙案或許是每天在搬演，因此記了下來，備後來者的提防。</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>我所見的亂世佳人</h3>
<p>— 薇君</p>
<p>我們知道「亂世佳人」影片是根據隨風而去」一部小說改編的，這部小說是女作家瑪格蘭米翠兒的成名創作，行銷二百萬本，譯成十六國文字，因為這部小說是以美國南北戰爭作經，兒女愛情作緯，所以美國人特別愛讀，光在美國銷去一百七十五萬本，一旦拍成影片，而且是忠於原書的長片，電影王國的孑民，自然是如瘋如在了。</p>
<p>這部亂世佳人既然是忠於原書的文藝片，我們在觀看此片以前，對於原書不能不先有認識，吾則人云亦云般擠熱鬧，對於片中的精彩難免要打個折扣。如果沒有時閒讀那一千另三十七頁的原著，最低的限度應該一讀「亂世佳人」的本事。</p>
<p>這張片子與其說偉大，不如說細膩。牠把一個剛愎目私的女孩兒的心緒曲曲地描出，與紅樓夢有異曲同工之妙，就我所看到的有三點是值得一提的。</p>
<p>技巧的卓越</p>
<p>這張片子內有不少新的技巧的運用。有好幾個反光鏡頭在攝影藝術方面已　到了化境。彩色亦有卓越的成就，艷而不俗，幽而不晦，柔和而不刺目，這些都是在亂世佳人以　的彩色片中所不曾見到的。導演的手法亦堪稱頌。譬如說黑奴捉鷄的一幕，黑奴　　地　　着鮮紅雄冠的鷄，色彩的艷麗與穿插的雋冷，眞令人有觀止之嘆。又如史迦蘭手刃散兵的一幕，槍聲響處，那散兵滿臉血污，滾下樓梯，情景的偪眞，令人心悸。</p>
<p>演技的精湛</p>
<p>克拉克蓋博，李思廉霍華，奧麗薇哈佛蘭等都是久享盛名的斷輪老手，演技的精到，當然不在話下。只是那扮演史迦蘭的費雯莉，雖亦上過銀幕，却是一向沒沒無聞，這一次在亂世佳人裹自始至終最吃重亦最努力。她的表情，潑辣，幽怨，堅毅把一個千古薄命的女子的心情和盤托出，不能不說是她的大成功。</p>
<p>佈景的雄偉</p>
<p>阿脫倫泰　城的仿古建築，特砌的街道，沖天的大火，呻吟的傷兵等幾幕，感動得觀影人幾乎同銀幕化成一片。其他一地一景一衣一物都不背時代，忠於原書。這種一絲不苟的態度，雖說是好萊塢的一貫作風，也非他們資力雄厚不惜耗費不行。</p>
<h3>上漲劇藝社今後的趨向</h3>
<p>— 沈琪</p>
<p>話劇趨向前進</p>
<p>話劇在上海，觀衆的數量似乎不廣，其實在　識的啟示和情緒的把握十話劇是優過於一般的皮黃劇和電影。近來，抗建的空氣高漲，而皮黃劇仍舊故步自對，電影更是反鑽在攝製民簡故事的牛角尖里，於是進步的觀衆都傾向於話劇，觀於職業劇團或業餘劇團的受人擁護，即是一種證明。其中職業劇團，目下祇有中國旅行　團和上海劇藝社二個，不多幾夫前，他們都為了地盤問題動搖起來，但如今中放已經續訂合同半年，同時劇藝社，今後趨向的方針也吿決定了。</p>
<p>劇藝社決續約</p>
<p>劇藝社原是靑島劇社的蛻化，後受中法聯誼會的贊助，於是更易今名，首先在璇宮劇院演出，「明末遺恨」一劇，奠定今日極高的地位。待裴宮五個月租期滿後，就移到辣斐劇塲，所演「祖國」「李秀成殉國」「梁紅玉」各劇，都很　到輿論贊美，他們與辣斐的租期是到本月二十三日滿期，這是他們的　期過程。本來，第三期計劃預備統領全社長征南洋羣島，近則因為歐　關係，所以取消前議，仍定與辣斐重訂新合同，自本月二十八日起，繼續半年，不過從前是前後台拆賬性質，現在是劇藝社單獨負責，每日付與塲主房租若干。</p>
<p>每週調易一劇</p>
<p>關於他們第三期的計劃，除了全社協力合作，加緊本位工作外，並且訓練新社員，以便增強陣容。同時演出各劇也將有所變動，就是在二十四日起，休息四天，待到一十八日開始，以後每逢一個禮拜。調易　劇，其中決定者，第一個禮拜是夏霞柏李徐立主演的「這不過是春天一，第二個禮拜是陸露明主演的「少奶奶的扇子」。</p>
<h3>兩劇壇之新陣容</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>專邀北方名伶演劇之黃金和更新兩家戲院，下月初均有新角應聘來滬出演：黃金方面之新角為花衫毛世來，更新為鬚生譚富英。聽說這次和他們同來的名伶為數甚多，記者巳向兩家戲院採得陣容之究竟，下面作一個總揭曉：</p>
<p>毛世來一隊</p>
<p>毛世來一隊人馬，現在靑島光陸戲院出演，演罷後即將來滬，大約下月初旬在黃金登台，陣容如左：</p>
<p>主角　毛世來</p>
<p>鬚生　陳少霖</p>
<p>小生　陳盛泰</p>
<p>丑角　艾世菊　詹世輔　羅盛公</p>
<p>花臉　袁世海　許盛奎</p>
<p>裹子老生許喜星</p>
<p>武生　張雲溪</p>
<p>武旦　王世祥</p>
<p>武行　張少傑</p>
<p>上面之陣容，與世來前次來滬稍有更易，鬚生沙世鑫己易為陳少霖，（原定此次隨毛來滬之鬆生本為遲世恭，世恭以出科未久，復以沙世鑫前次貿然南來之失意，乃謝絕黃金之邀，因改邀少霖）。小生江世玉亦易為陳盛泰。（據云因世玉索價過高之故）盛泰今春曾隨奚嘯伯來，頗獲好評，且亦為富連成之畢業生，與世來配戲，預料必能勝任愉快也。丑角艾世菊羅盛公，皆前决之舊人馬，此次復加入詹世輔，益覺錦上添花，按世輔之丑，在科時紅極一時，遠在世菊之上，為世來坐科時之老搭擋，世來初次南來時，世輔　隨之同來，旋以嗓音失潤世來乃邀世菊為配，者番重與世來合作，眞觀衆之佳音。花臉內定為袁世海，因世海方隨連良在滬出演，惟法風社目前對淨角極為重視，連良是否肯讓世海留滬猶一問題。裹子老生陳喜星，為富連成之天師兄，與毛師苟慧生配戲甚久，亦此中之能手。室於武生一角，黃金在接洽張雲溪，惟雲溪現在關外出演，紅極一時，屆時能否趕到，目前尚難斷定，設雲溪來，則武旦一王世祥及雲溪之下手張少傑皆將同來，否則黃金方面，擬的吳彥衡蟬聯一期云。</p>
<h3>梁小鸞投拜梅蘭芒</h3>
<p>— 谷</p>
<p>坤伶梁小鸞，這次在更新演出，給予顧曲界的印象甚佳，今日起，開始貼臨別紀念了，昨日，記者在中國飯店會見梁琦（即小鸞之別名），問她在更新演畢下來後，打算有什麽新的發展她笑笑地回答記者說</p>
<p>「雖然我道决在上海演出的成績，還能使人滿意，但我覺得自己的藝術，非常不夠，所以在更新下來後，不想謀什麼新的發展，而想好好的冉去苦學一下，拜一個先生」。</p>
<p>接着她又說：「最近有位沈太太曾對我說過，有意為我介紹，師事於一代藝人梅蘭芳博士，要是沒有意外阻礙的話，那麼在滬休息數天後，就赴港投拜梅博士去」。</p>
<p>據說，這位沈太太表示，由她來介紹是有十二分把握的，我們但願沒有意外阻礙才好，那麽繼「小鳥」王熙春之後，梅博士又將多增一位高徒了。</p>
<h3>影壇近事錄</h3>
<p>— 鄭白永</p>
<p>近來傳說新華將大量製作「民間故事」影片，同時開拍「珍珠塔」，「描金鳳」，「玉蜻蜓」　片；聞其中略有出入，上列　片並非新華之計劃，乃新近尚在組織中某影業公司所預定之處女製作，該公司同屬於中國聯合影業公司管轄下，故目前該某公司登記手續尚未通過，或許暫時委託新華廠代製。</p>
<p>某公司以浩大之資本，假諸新華，華新，華成之技術人員，及廣闊之攝影廠，準備以最敏捷之手法，預定製作八九都出品，如徐欣未導演上官雲珠，顧也魯，姜明，韓蘭根主演之「王老虎搶親；湯傑導演，李紅，張婉主演之「描金鳳」；卜萬蒼導演，陳燕燕李清顧也魯主演之「碧玉簣」等。</p>
<p>「杜十娘」一劇，也是某公司預定九部傑作之一，現聞有轉讓與國華攝製之說。</p>

<h3>好萊塢女明星競保健美險　宋雅海妮一雙溜冰腿　竟保險二百六十萬元</h3>
<p>六月十八日新聞報藝海登載一條極有趣的新聞，說是好萊塢的影星，為了保障她們身體健美，不惜以鉅款保險，以防意外，因為她們體格的健美，輿她們的聲譽是有極密切的關係的，如「玉趾流芳」中的足尖舞女星左玲娜，她的一雙玉趾，每隻保險二十五萬元，女星愛麗絲費，她的膚色經彩色片專家認為是不需脂紛，最適宜於拍攝彩色片的，因之她的膚色也保有二萬五千元的險，另一個女星安妮泰露意絲，她的體重是好萊塢最適中的，因之她的「標準體重」，也保險七萬五千元，宋雅海妮的各項保險總額，共計三百萬元，其中二百六十萬元，便是保她的兩條「溜冰腿」的這種駭人聽開的保險，足證影星們是如何的重視與賣貴她們的健美了，返觀我國的婦女，雖然在古代受人稱頌的病態美如西施的捧心，黛玉的多病，已被時代洶汰而成為歷史的遺跡了，但是仍存留着少數的婦女，雖有着天生的美顏，但因身體瘦弱的緣故，往往胸部是平坦的，肌膚是無光彩的，雖然濃施脂粉，滿身錦　，總脫不了一身的病態，看到人家的聳乳高臀，昂視闊步，眞是何等的羨幕，何等的愧憾。</p>

<h3>法代表首途北上 與德方進行和平談判 法政府接受德義所提條件 德軍長驅南下佔領里昂城</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German government received this morning at 1:00 AM, a formal document from the Spanish side, concerning the French government's delegation of full-power representatives to negotiate armistice terms. German Führer Adolf Hitler received this report at 4:00 AM this morning. The German High Command has issued all necessary instructions, preparing to receive the French armistice delegation, which includes General Huntziger, Ambassador Noel, General Lelu, and General Bergeret. (Reuter, June 20th)</p>
<p>Geneva: French Radio reported this morning that the French peace delegation departed yesterday from a French airfield by plane, with the aircraft painted white. (Reuter, June 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid: According to local newspapers, before deciding on the armistice, France held a cabinet meeting that continued from the afternoon of the 15th to the late night of the 16th. Reynaud and others hoped the government would move to North Africa, but President Lebrun insisted on staying in the country. Finally, Pétain and Weygand threatened to resign, which ended the discussion and led to the decision to seek an armistice. (Reuter, June 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry told reporters that the current armistice negotiations cannot be compared to those of 1918. At that time, Marshal Foch told the German representatives that Germany must accept all terms. (Reuter, June 20th)</p>
<p>Madrid: An unidentified radio station recently broadcast news stating that after appointing full-power representatives to negotiate peace with Germany, French Prime Minister Marshal Pétain had resigned and been succeeded by Laval as Prime Minister. (United Press, June 20th)</p>
<p>London: According to unofficial sources, French Prime Minister Marshal Pétain has left French territory and will organize a French government in a foreign location. Also, according to unofficial sources, former French Prime Minister Reynaud, National Republican Party leader Marin, and other French officials have been arrested by the government. (United Press, June 20th)</p>
<p>Report: Peace Negotiations Concluded; Fighting in France Soon to Cease</p>
<p>Rome: According to a special correspondent of the semi-official Stefani News Agency in Berlin, peace between Germany and France has been concluded, and fighting will cease on Friday or Saturday. The French representatives have also returned to Bordeaux. (United Press, June 20th)</p>
<p>Italian Newspaper Comments on Armistice Terms: Strict Yet Fair</p>
<p>Berlin: The German official news agency reports from Rome that the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia commented on the Munich Conference between the two dictators, saying that while the terms proposed by Germany and Italy to France are strict, they will be fairer than the terms imposed at the end of the last war. One thing must not be forgotten: that the Treaty of Versailles deprived Germany and Austria of nearly ten million people of Germanic descent, and that all of Germany's colonies were seized. Although Italy lacks air space, its colonies were also seized, which must not be forgotten. The new European order will restore the equitable distribution of overseas territories and political balance, which are conditions for lasting peace in Europe and the world. (Reuters, June 20th)</p>
<p>Sourek: Reports from Rome and Berlin suggest that the Axis powers will not allow a ceasefire unless it is equivalent to France's complete surrender. According to an article by Mussolini's spokesman, Gaida, published in the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia, Germany and Italy will now double their efforts to attack Britain. Germany will attack northern Britain, and Italy will attack British positions in the Mediterranean, Africa, and the Near East. Whether or not the United States enters the war, Italy's attack on these areas will be successful. (Reuters, June 20th)</p>
<p>German Vanguard Enters Lyon; French Officials Continue to Serve</p>
<p>Lyon, France: The vanguard of the German army, advancing along the Rhine River, entered Lyon today. French authorities declared the city an undefended city and did not defend it. Regarding the German army's entry into Lyon, a newspaper reporter telegraphed Bordeaux to report to the government, saying that after the first German troops entered the city, only a few German trucks and tanks were seen on Rue de la République. The whole city was calm as usual. The Prefect of the Rhône, Paulaire, the Archbishop of Lyon, Cardinal Charlier, and city officials continued to serve. Public utilities were not interrupted, but the streets were quite quiet. All police officers continued to patrol as usual, but their weapons had been disarmed by the German army. Soon, a large number of German troops arrived, and German troops guarded all bridges. Local authorities issued a public notice to reassure the people, the full text of which is as follows: "The events we expected have occurred. Lyon was originally an undefended city and has now been occupied by the vanguard of the German army. Their main force will continue to arrive. In this situation, our duty is to maintain dignity and remain calm. The authorities issued this notice for the safety of the city and the glory of the country. It is hoped that all citizens will be aware of this intention and will abide by the law and maintain order." This notice was jointly signed by the Prefect of the Rhône, Paulaire, the Vice-Prefect, Cohenthé, the Archbishop, Charlier, and the Secretary-General of the Association of Veterans of the Last European War, Vigal. (Havas, June 20th)</p>
<p>Marshal Pétain's Broadcast Address: States Reasons for Military Failure</p>
<p>Bordeaux: French Prime Minister Marshal Pétain said in a radio broadcast today: "The reason for our army's defeat is that our weapons and equipment were insufficient and we had too few allied troops. People of France, I have asked the enemy to end hostilities. The government yesterday appointed full-power representatives to accept their terms. This decision was made with the steadfastness of soldiers, because we were forced to do so by the war situation. We originally hoped to resist on the Somme-Aisne line. General Weygand had reorganized our army, and his reputation alone could predict victory, but the line eventually shifted backward under enemy pressure. Since June 13, it has been inevitable to request a ceasefire." Marshal Pétain continued to state the reasons for this, saying: "Previously, on May 1, 1917, after three years of hard fighting, we still had 3.28 million soldiers in arms. But on the eve of this war, we had 500,000 fewer soldiers than that. In May 1918, we had 85 British divisions to assist us; in May of this year, we only had ten divisions. In May 1918, there were still 58 Italian divisions and 42 American divisions. Our war materials were inferior to those of the enemy, even more so than our strength. French aircraft in combat were in a ratio of one to six with enemy aircraft. The French people do not deny the blows they have suffered. All people know honor and disgrace. They can react and express their own dignity. We will learn from the great defeat. After the victory of 1918, the desire for pleasure exceeded the spirit of sacrifice. The people needed more than they gave. Everyone wanted to conserve their own labor, and today disaster has befallen us. On the day of glory, I was with you. Now, on the day of darkness, I am still with you as the leader of the government. You are all standing by the roadside. The war is still going on. This is a struggle for France, that is, for the land of its children and grandchildren." (Reuters, June 20th)</p>
<p>French Government Leaves Bordeaux; Rumors of Relocation to Tunis, North Africa</p>
<p>London: According to reliable sources, the French government has left Bordeaux and it is not known where it has moved to. (United Press, June 20th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to authoritative sources here, the Army Intelligence Agency received a report last night stating that the French government has now moved to Tunis. (United Press, June 20th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux: German air fleets launched two air raids on Bordeaux and the banks of the Gironde River this morning, and it is reported that many civilians were killed and injured. The first air raid was at 1:00 AM. This was the most brutal air raid since the bombing of Paris. There were as many as 100 German planes flying over Bordeaux, dropping more than 100 bombs and incendiary bombs, and dropping the same amount of explosives on airfields, docks, and shipyards near the banks of the Gironde River. The first air raid was at 6:00 AM, but French fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns immediately resisted, and the German planes fled without being able to carry out damage work. (United Press, June 20th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux: The German government's reply received by the cabinet this morning did not contain armistice terms. Fighting on the front lines must be suspended only after an agreement is reached on the terms of the peace, that is, after a meeting of the full-power representatives of both sides. Therefore, the cabinet can now ignore the German terms or whether the fighting has stopped and directly appoint full-power representatives to negotiate with the Germans. A true armistice must wait a few days. Therefore, before the ceasefire order is issued, the German army may continue to advance, and the troops advancing in the southeast are likely to contact the Italian army before the ceasefire. (Havas, June 19th)</p>
<p>If Toulon Harbor is Attacked, the French Navy Will Defend It with All Its Might</p>
<p>Toulon Harbor, France: Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, issued a public statement today, saying that although the government has declared all cities and towns with a population of more than 20,000 to be undefended cities, Toulon Harbor is not one of them. Therefore, if the enemy attacks, our navy will defend it with all its might. (Havas, June 20th)</p>
<h3>German Military Report</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command announced this morning that Strasbourg, the capital of the French Bas-Rhin department, has been occupied by our army. (Reuter, June 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German officials announced yesterday the occupation of Strasbourg. The city has a population of 180,000 and was the earliest city established by the Germanic people. In 1250, it became a German free city. In 1681, it was incorporated into France under Louis XIV. At the end of the Franco-Prussian War, it was again incorporated into Germany as the capital of Alsace-Lorraine. Until the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles, the city was returned to France. The city's greatest feature is its magnificent cathedral, one of whose spires is 142 meters high, one of the tallest buildings in Europe. (Reuter, June 20th)</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters: This afternoon's German military report stated that the German army has occupied the key French naval port of Brest. The German army has reached the lower reaches of the Loire River. German planes continue to bomb enemy troops south of the river. Wherever the enemy troops try their best to resist, German planes are dispatched to assist the advance of the infantry. In northern Lorraine, the remaining French troops are trapped in the Moselle area, mostly between Épinal and Toul. Both places, as well as Lunéville, are in German hands. There is still fighting on both sides of Diedenhofen. Fast-bombing bombers and fighters destroyed most of the Maginot Line's projects. The German army entered Strasbourg from the southeast and captured more than 200,000 prisoners yesterday. General Altmayer, commander of the French 10th Army, and his chief of staff were captured. (Reuter, June 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German military experts recently declared in a supplementary communique that the remnants of the French army, chased by the German army, are now advancing further into southern France. According to the communique's comments, there are two noteworthy points about the German advance: Cherbourg, a key port with naval and commercial importance on the Norman peninsula, has been occupied. The remaining German troops have arrived at Le Mans, a key railway junction on the Brittany peninsula. Therefore, although threatened by the British army, both the Norman and Brittany peninsulas are safe. Cherbourg is an important naval base and occupies an important position in commerce, because the import of British coal must pass through this port, and this port is the terminus of several overseas routes. Le Mans is the former capital of Brittany and a railway junction, important for western France. Various equipment on the railways there was heavily bombed by the German air force a few days ago, so it is impossible for the French army to escape along this line. The battle report also stated that the German army has crossed the small town of Limoges and is advancing south. Between Le Mans and Limoges, the German army is now advancing downstream on the Loire River towards Tours and Nancy. In the Poitou region, the German army is advancing towards Lyon. German mechanized troops have crossed the Saône River and are heading south. These German troops will soon arrive on the banks of the Rhône River in Lyon. The Rhône River is a key transportation route in central and southern France. On the upper reaches of the Rhine, west of the Maginot Line's bag-shaped position and the Swiss border, the fighting is extremely fierce. The German encirclement of the French army is intensifying. The German cars advancing in Zifod in eastern France will soon make contact with the German army advancing on the upper Rhine. The Vosges Mountains are attacked from both sides, and the operation is successful. The occupation of Mösst is a clear example. French troops are now resisting on the Maginot Line north of Metz, but there is no hope of assistance. The Nancy battery south of Metz has been captured. The Saar River, which leads east to the Marne and Rhine rivers, has also been seized. Although the French army has repeatedly tried to break through, the result has been heavy losses. The fiercest fighting is now in the Voses area. A bag-shaped position seems to have formed in the [Vosges] theater. The French army along the Maginot Line and the French army on the upper Rhine are still trapped and will be annihilated. On June 18, the German Air Force cooperated with the Army, launched fierce attacks in the Maginot Line area, and fiercely bombed British airfields and oil depots on the Thames River. These two points are particularly noteworthy. The sound of explosions after the bombing was thunderous, and the raging fire can prove the success of the German Air Force. The bombing of British oil tanks is enough to make the British anxious, because since Italy entered the war, Mediterranean freight has been blockaded, and the supply of British oil has become difficult.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Changing European War and the Eastern Moral Viewpoint</h3>
<p>Germany and France have begun negotiations. Although the outcome is unknown, we very much hope that they will achieve near-ideal results. At this time, when no agreement has been reached, it can be said that the eight-and-a-half-month Western Front war has come to an end. France, which has always symbolized freedom, equality, and fraternity, will temporarily restrain its glory and turn to deal with the Nazis and Fascists. This is an extremely important turning point in modern history, and the world should not hesitate to extend the greatest sympathy to France and its people, who fought bravely but were defeated.</p>
<p>After more than a month of hard fighting, France's capital fell, its elite forces were wiped out, and the Maginot Line, which had always been regarded as impregnable, lost its ability to resist after the main force was defeated. Losing despite fighting is not a crime. The French soldiers and people made their best efforts to defend their country. Their final abandonment of war and reconciliation has inevitable difficulties, both internally and externally. Therefore, while issuing a call for a truce, they are still expressing that what they can accept is glory and not humiliation. The world should not find it difficult to imagine the difficult situation and internal pain of the French military and political authorities at this time. However, although France's main army was wiped out and most of its rich area was lost, is there really no other way to go except to abandon war and reconcile? Is it only by engaging in a truce that France's glory can be maintained? Judged by the standards of Eastern social values, one cannot help but feel a sense of regret amidst grief and sympathy.</p>
<p>Regarding the point of being defeated and surrendering to the enemy, the East has a different view from the West. The West focuses on reality, so defeat and surrender is a logical conclusion. The East admires ideals, so there is the doctrine of "better to be a shattered jade than an unbroken tile" and "resolutely die without yielding." Countless different styles can be found in the history of both sides. Judging with a fair eye, it is certainly impossible to rush to a conclusion, but there is no doubt that this style of the East is more magnificent and can better inspire the military and the people, and sometimes it can have the effect of turning danger into safety. The root cause of this is, on the one hand, the difference in moral standards between the East and the West, and on the other hand, the difference in views between feudal society and capitalist society. As William Hazlitt seemed to say: "The spirit of dying with composure is most abundant in barbaric nations; the higher the civilization, the more this spirit erodes" (roughly). And the spirit of "knowing that it cannot be done and doing it anyway" is a specialty of the East. It is no accident that the founders of major religions all came from the East. This spirit once influenced Europe with the spread of Christianity, and among the ancient Greek so-called "heathen" philosophers and certain scientists in the Middle Ages, one can occasionally see the existence of this temperament. However, since the rise of capitalism and the so-called modern culture has enveloped everything, people's consciousness cannot get rid of the influence of production relations. In that society where people calculate every gain and loss, emphasize efficiency, value reality, and only know how to obey vulgar laws, idealists are often ridiculed, and lofty ideals are often regarded as unrealistic. Therefore, superhuman miracles are rarely seen in today's era. This is certainly the result of the fact that human power has been relatively extremely reduced after the development of material civilization, but the main reason is still social relations. After the last European war, communism and totalitarianism arose, slightly showing some effect of spiritual inspiration. The strength and sharpness of Germany's combat power this time is partly due to this, but its foundation and influence cannot be compared to Eastern countries. As for the democratic countries where old capitalism is more dominant, the lack of this kind of martyr-like spirit is undeniable.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, all of the above should be classified into the category of feudal morality, but this is the bright side of feudal society. Capitalism's elimination of this kind of virtue has been regarded as one of the reasons why it should be condemned. China has a longer period occupied by the feudal era in history than any other country, so its immersion in this moral tradition is also deeper. The doctrine of "achieving benevolence and taking righteousness" and the admonition of "never being complacent in the face of difficulties" have long exerted a religious-like power. By the time of the Song Confucianists, the theory of justice and reason was carried to the extreme, and morality and integrity were regarded as the highest model of human morality. Great feats of integrity and martyrdom, such as Tian Heng and his five hundred men, Zhang Xun, Xu Yuan, Wen Tianxiang, and Shi Kefa, occupy an extremely important position in Chinese history alone. These great feats cannot be found in today's capitalist society. In recent years, although China's ancient social system has gradually collapsed in the face of modern civilization, the stimulation of national difficulties has caused the old social morality to be combined with new national and ethnic concepts and re-emerge, becoming a vigorous and profound force. In the nearly three years of the War of Resistance, countless touching stories of men and women of integrity and martyrdom have been interspersed, especially soldiers, who are more heroic and commendable. There are very few acts that tarnish the country and the nation. Wu Peifu in the distant past and Zhang Zizhong in the recent past, although their ways of serving the country are different, both represent the righteousness of the Chinese nation. Yesterday's newspaper published a commendation by a certain Japanese spokesman praising the spirit of the Chinese army in the recent battle in western Hubei, which can further prove this. The reason why China's War of Resistance has been unyielding and has persisted to this day is partly due to the power formed by reason, and another part should be sought from the moral tradition in Chinese history.</p>
<p>This is not to emphasize the belief that spirit can overcome matter, nor is it to promote passive morality. The so-called spirit of martyrdom of "knowing that it cannot be done and doing it anyway" can sometimes only establish a valuable model and may not have practical benefits. At other times, it can break through the misfortune that everyone regards as irresistible with great determination and perseverance. In Chinese history, for example, Xie An and Xie Shi defeated Fu Qin, and Yu Yunwen defeated the Jin Emperor Liang; in Western history, such as the ancient Greeks resisting Persia, Rome defeating Hannibal, and in modern times Napoleon driving his army across the Alps, which had always been regarded as impassable, none of them succeeded by grasping the odds of victory. The achievements of several great scientists often went through the stage of being slandered, ridiculed, and even regarded as insane, and they finally succeeded by relying on their personal unyielding perseverance and struggling with the environment. However, within the scope of the country and politics and military affairs, what is involved is extremely complicated, and the will of the participating members may not be the same. It is easy to maintain a firm and consistent stance in a smooth environment, but in a time of crisis, it is often not controlled by a single will. It is most heartbreaking when success falls short. China also experienced extremely difficult times in the early days of the War of Resistance, but as a result, it was able to turn danger into safety and enter a smooth path with the extremely strong will of the highest authorities, which is what the Chinese people should be most proud of. At the same time, after the successive surrenders of large and small countries in Europe, it will undoubtedly make people realize the greatness and preciousness of the traditional Chinese spirit.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army on West Bank of Xiang River Achieves Victory: Recaptures Shashi and Enters Jiangling; Japanese Forces Completely Cleared from City; Fierce Fighting Near Shilipu; Another Chinese Army Approaches Jingmen</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Regarding the recent situation of the battle on the west bank of the Xiang River, a certain military spokesman told a Central News Agency reporter that concerning Yichang, after Chinese forces abandoned Yichang on the 15th, they launched a fierce counterattack the following morning, and by 3:00 AM on the 17th, they had recaptured Yichang. On that day, Japanese reinforcements came to attack again, and on the 18th, the Chinese forces made a strategic advance, immediately deploying the strongest encirclement lines in the suburbs and continuing their counterattack. The Japanese retreated into the city, and after two days and nights of attacks, the Chinese forces made steady progress, approaching within one Chinese mile of the city. They are currently continuing their fierce attack, and it is expected that the remaining Japanese forces in the city will soon be annihilated. Regarding Shashi, starting on the 12th, large Chinese forces besieged Shashi, and the Japanese forces retreated steadily. Until yesterday, fierce fighting occurred in the suburbs, and by midnight, the remaining Japanese forces in the city were completely annihilated by the Chinese, who then recaptured Shashi. On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese forces seized the momentum and stormed into the city of Jiangling, wiping out the remaining Japanese forces. Regarding Jingmen, starting on the 16th, Chinese forces attacked the Japanese in Jingmen from the northeast and southwest directions. By the 17th, the Chinese forces in the northeast had recaptured two strongholds located eight kilometers from Jingmen. That afternoon, the Japanese launched a fierce counterattack, but were defeated by the Chinese forces, who then attacked in triumph, forcing their way to the outskirts of Jingmen. The Chinese forces attacking from the southwest also recaptured a stronghold located eight kilometers from Jingmen on the 18th. The Japanese forces collapsed and retreated into the city. The Chinese forces have advanced to the city walls and have established strong contact with another friendly army, jointly attacking Jingmen. It is judged that they will be able to capture it within a few days. Regarding Dangyang, the main force of the Japanese army is located near Dangyang, and they have taken a defensive posture within a thirty-kilometer area, attempting to resist stubbornly. The Chinese forces are bravely besieging from all directions. Although there has been no significant development in the past few days, they have successively entered areas five and ten kilometers from Dangyang. The Japanese are resisting stubbornly, and the battle is raging. Regarding Shilipu, Shilipu is the intersection of the Hanyi and Xiangsha highways. The Japanese are stubbornly defending this location, accumulating military supplies. Last night, the Chinese forces launched an all-out attack with the strongest forces, besieging from multiple directions. The Japanese army is already showing signs of collapse. Regarding the east bank of the Xiang River, the Chinese forces have successively recaptured key points such as Changshou Town and Fengle River, and are continuing to attack the Japanese river-crossing points, making great progress. At the same time, the Chinese forces attacking Hanyang have achieved initial victories. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Shashi – The Chinese army has been fiercely attacking Jing (Jiangling) and Sha (Shashi) for days, making rapid progress. After the brave and loyal Chinese soldiers captured Fahua Temple and Fuhetai (both on the east side of Shashi) yesterday, they continued their advance. In the afternoon of the same day, they forced their way into the city streets and engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese. The Chinese army finally stormed into the city all at once after dusk on the 19th, wiping out the remaining Japanese forces, and completely recaptured Shashi, seizing a large number of weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies abandoned by the Japanese army. At this moment the Chinese army is fiercely attacking a certain important point. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Shashi – After the Chinese army recaptured Shashi last night, they took advantage of the victory to advance towards Jiangling. They encountered the Japanese forces reinforcing Shashi from Jiangling in the area north of Jinlong Temple (north of Shashi), resulting in an engagement. Another Chinese army took the opportunity to circle behind the Japanese forces and launched a fierce assault directly towards Jiangling. The Japanese forces in the city responded hastily and were caught off guard. On the morning of the 20th, the Chinese forces broke through the defenses and stormed into the city, occupying key points within the city. A portion of the Japanese infantry retreated out of the city in disarray, while the majority were unable to retreat in time and gathered in the city, resisting stubbornly against the Chinese forces, who are currently conducting a fierce mop-up operation. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>A Certain Location in Western Hubei – The Chinese armies in western Hubei have gradually completed the encirclement of the Japanese forces. Tens of thousands of Japanese soldiers who have broken into the Chinese encirclement between Yichang and Dangyang are now trapped in a desperate situation. In the suburbs of Yichang, Chinese and Japanese forces are still engaged in bloody battles, and the Japanese morale has been shaken. On the 19th, heavy rain fell again on the front line, rendering the Japanese aircraft ineffective. The Chinese forces are fiercely attacking on both lines, making rapid progress. The battle situation is about to undergo a rapid shift, entering a stage of absolute victory for China. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Yichang Battlefield – The bloody battles in the suburbs of Yichang are becoming increasingly fierce today. The Chinese army is besieging the Japanese from all directions, fighting bravely and advancing without retreating. Surrounded on all sides, the Japanese are being attacked from all directions and have no way to escape. They are currently still holding on to the highlands south of Dongshan Temple and various street corners, putting up a desperate struggle. The Chinese forces are giving them a heavy blow and will soon complete the anticipated annihilation. The Chinese army besieging Jingmen has continued to make progress. The highlands surrounding the city on all sides, such as Xishan (west of the city), Dongshan (east of the city), Wulidun (north of the city), and Wangbingshi (south of the city), have all been captured by the Chinese. The Japanese have launched repeated counterattacks, but have been defeated each time, and are lying dormant in the city, showing signs of disintegration. The Chinese forces are still attacking fiercely. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese military spokesman recently stated that Yichang has been lost and regained four times in the past four days. Although the city was occupied by the Japanese army again on June 18th, the fighting on the west bank of the Han River and the outskirts of Yichang has not ceased to this day. The main location of the current fighting is Dangyang, thirty miles northeast of Yichang, where the Chinese army is currently engaged in a fierce counterattack. The Chinese army initially decided to withdraw from Yichang on June 15th. Two days later, the city was recaptured by the Chinese army, and on June 18th, it was occupied by the Japanese army again. The main force of the Japanese army on the west bank of the Han River has now been surrounded by the Chinese army and will be completely annihilated by the Chinese army. Chinese troops have now occupied various ports along the Han River and a stretch of the Yangtze River ten miles northwest and southwest of Hanyang. In addition, the Chinese army recaptured Shashi on June 19th. (United Press Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Yichang Battlefield – The Japanese army gathered near Dangyang is attempting to hold on and resist stubbornly. The fighting has been extremely fierce in the past two days. The Chinese army, carrying out a brave encirclement, has a majestic momentum and invincible force. On the southwest side of Dangyang, the Chinese army recaptured Yuquan Mountain on the 19th and continued to capture the highlands around Caoanzi and Langzishan today. South of Changyang, the Chinese army captured Wandianzi on the 19th and is advancing fiercely northward today, successively capturing the line of Mujiajiang, Xijiajiang, Lijiajiang, and Zhoujiabang. On the southeast side of Dangyang, the Chinese army is continuously attacking the Japanese strongholds on the Hanyi Road between Dangyang and Herong, and the Japanese transportation has been cut off. In the northeast and northwest regions of Dangyang, the Chinese army has now recaptured the highlands around Xuyoushan, Tongshuya, Jiuzishan, and Dagutai. The Chinese armies of all routes have compressed the encirclement to an area less than ten kilometers in length and width. (Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<h3>Advancing Japanese Troops in Southern Shandong Have Been Repelled</h3>
<p>A Certain Location in Shandong – Since late last month, the Japanese, dividing into three routes, advanced towards the mountainous area east of Linyi in southern Shandong. The total number of Japanese troops was more than 2,000. One route advanced north from Qushan Town, one route advanced east from Linyi and Feixian, and one route advanced south from Juxian and Yishui. In recent days, the Chinese army has used clever deployments to inflict heavy blows on them along the way, capturing a large number of enemy soldiers. Now, after suffering this heavy blow, the majority of the Japanese on each route have retreated, and the Chinese are taking advantage of the victory to mop up the remaining Japanese forces.

<h3>After the Establishment of the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Agreement: Lifting of the Blockade of the Tianjin Concessions; Everything Inside the Concessions Has Returned to Normal; Details of the Agreement Were Released in London the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tianjin – The commander of the Japanese garrison issued a notice this morning, declaring that the traffic control regulations imposed on the British and French concessions would be lifted at 6:00 PM today. A Japanese military spokesman claimed that the curfew would also be lifted, and the inspection sheds in front of the barriers would be gradually dismantled. The sentries in front of the barriers would be withdrawn after 6:00 PM, but soldiers at the boundary would remain stationed for a week to observe the amount of traffic but not control it, it was said. The British Consul-General, White, met with members of the press today and read to them the official British statement regarding the resolution of the Tianjin dispute. Mr. Donner, the Chairman of the British Municipal Council, told a guest that the British Municipal Council intends to hire a Japanese advisor to assist in matters relating to the Japanese. Further details could not be provided. (Reuters Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – The blockade of the Tianjin concessions, which lasted 372 days, was lifted at 6:00 PM tonight. Free traffic between the British and French concessions and the surrounding areas has been restored. Before the official opening, a simple ceremony was held, during which a military officer inspected the Japanese guards lined up and addressed them, after which they withdrew. The spectators at the ceremony, mostly Chinese, with a small number of Japanese and foreigners mixed in, applauded to show their joy. Minutes before the opening, vehicles were blocked by barriers across the street, and long lines of pedestrians, bicycles, cars, and trucks piled up on both sides. Chinese police officers worked hard to direct pedestrians and vehicles to the side of the road before the official opening. At precisely 6:00 PM, the barriers across the street were removed, allowing all traffic to pass through smoothly in an orderly manner. Traffic was managed by Chinese police officers. Several Japanese soldiers stood on the sidewalk with fixed bayonets, watching everything. Yingzhong Street, which had been deserted for a long time, suddenly became active again. Cars and trucks full of Japanese people traveled back and forth like shuttles, as the restrictions on Japanese people passing through the barriers during the blockade were stricter than those on ordinary foreigners. Most of the Japanese people carried cameras and took many photos in front of the barriers and inside the concessions. It is expected that Japanese banks, companies, and shops will gradually move back to their old locations in the British and French concessions to operate, but there is currently no definitive news about this. (Reuters Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – After the Japanese authorities here removed the blockade lines of the British and French concessions in Tianjin at 6:00 PM this afternoon, various vehicles loaded with food and other goods drove into the concessions like a tide. Everything inside the concessions instantly returned to normal. The Japanese blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin has lasted for more than a year. (Havas Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The twelve-month-long blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin was officially lifted tonight. According to the semi-official Japanese news agency, the British concession authorities and the Japanese authorities in Dagu have reached a detailed agreement on close cooperation in suppressing all terrorist activities that impede peace, order, and the safety of the Japanese army. Both sides have agreed that the Japanese military police will provide information, and when the British Municipal Council police take action against suspected criminals noticed by the Japanese authorities, the Japanese military police will be present. This action will include the supervision of arms and explosives trading, the monitoring of printed materials, cinemas, and political gatherings, and the arrest and disposal of undesirable elements. The silver coins and silver bars currently in the Bank of Communications will be jointly sealed by the British and Japanese consuls-general and will remain stored in the bank. (Reuters Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – The Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese garrison here issued a proclamation this morning, stating that the Tianjin blockade of over a year would be lifted at 6:00 PM this afternoon. The proclamation also stated that all kinds of restrictions would be lifted because the Japanese authorities had reached a final agreement with the British authorities on the disposal of Chinese silver deposits in the concessions, and the purpose of the restrictions had been achieved. However, the proclamation also warned that the Japanese army would continue to monitor the situation within the concessions and would determine its policies based on the development of the situation. If necessary, it would restore all kinds of restrictions. According to a Japanese spokesman here, the curfew will also be lifted tonight. Japanese soldiers must still be stationed on the roads connecting the concessions at the entrances and exits to examine the amount of traffic, but not to manage the traffic. (United Press Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>London – The Times editorial stated that the negotiations on the Tianjin dispute have been going on for a year, and the current resolution should not be used to draw any general conclusions, but it can eliminate the various causes of friction in the local area. Anglo-Japanese relations will therefore be improved, and the interests of the Chinese government have not been sacrificed, as the British consulted with the Chinese government at all times during the negotiations. The Chinese government will undoubtedly issue a statement on the issue in the near future. (Reuters Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>Tianjin – According to the semi-official Japanese news agency, Japanese Consul-General Takeo has formally approved Japanese residents who wish to reside and operate in the British and French concessions, but they must register with the Japanese authorities. (Reuters Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>London – The details of the Anglo-Japanese agreement were released here yesterday, and the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin is expected to be lifted today. The agreement stipulates detailed measures for the British concession authorities and local Japanese officials to strengthen cooperation to ban all terrorist activities that disrupt peace and the safety of the Japanese army. According to the measures, the Japanese authorities can notify British police officers to request the arrest of terrorists, and Japanese representatives can participate in the arrest operations. The transport of contraband and military supplies is also controlled by the Japanese. All publications and films must be censored according to the will of the Japanese. Anti-Japanese gatherings are also prohibited. Of the silver stored by the Chinese government in Tianjin, £100,000 will be used for disaster relief work, and the remainder will be stored in the Bank of Communications, sealed by the British and Japanese consuls-general. The above agreement also stipulates that the British authorities must not prevent the circulation of "Lianhe" banknotes in the British concession. The British Municipal Council will revoke the licenses of exchange shops established after 1938. The council will no longer issue new licenses to exchange shops without sufficient reserves. As for the difficulties arising from the agreement, they can be discussed and resolved by the British and Japanese consuls. (United Press Dispatch of the 20th)</p>
<p>London – In the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Agreement, regarding police and military affairs, it is stipulated that there will be closer cooperation between the British Municipal Council authorities and the Tianjin Japanese authorities to punish people whose criminal activities are related to Japan. Undersecretary Butler made a written statement on the agreement in the House of Commons yesterday, saying, "However, I wish to clearly state that in such cases, the necessary actions will be taken by the police department of the Municipal Council, and the administrative integrity of the British concession has been fully maintained in the agreement." The Japanese government claims that the silver stored in the Tianjin concession belongs to the people of North China and should be returned for events beneficial to them. The Chinese government claims that this silver belongs to the government and is part of the legal currency reserve. The current temporary agreement between the United Kingdom and Japan does not presume on this point of contention. Butler announced this agreement, saying, "The British government welcomes the conclusion of the agreement and firmly believes that it will facilitate the elimination of some of the suffering suffered by British and other third-party nationals and their business and maritime circles in China, and can show that the country and Japan can resolve their various disputes with patient negotiations." As a result of the conclusion of this agreement, the barriers around the British and French concessions in Tianjin are now being removed. One-tenth of the total amount of silver stored in various Chinese banks will be used for humanitarian affairs to relieve the disaster victims in North China, and the remainder will be sealed in various banks pending a decision on the final disposal method. Butler also said that the solution to this problem has been approved by the Chinese government. Chinese legal tender may still be used in the area under the jurisdiction of the British Municipal Council. However, "Lianhe paper money" has been used interchangeably with Chinese legal tender for some time in the past. The agreement recognizes this existing situation. You should know that the barriers built by the Japanese around the concessions have never been removed since the beginning of last year, and countless control regulations have been enforced on the residents. This barrier and the control regulations are now being eliminated. The Japanese authorities in North China also undertake to make efforts to curb anti-British actions or anti-British instigation in certain areas under their jurisdiction.

<h3>Full Text of the Anglo-Japanese Tianjin Agreement</h3>
<p>As a result of the negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities on various issues in the British concession in Tianjin since July 1939, an agreement on the following points has been reached: (1) The issue of maintaining order in the British concession: The British and Japanese authorities have detailed cooperation measures for suppressing terrorists and actions that hinder order and security, that is, the Japanese military police may report to the British concession authorities, and the Japanese military police may participate when the British concession police arrest people with such criminal behavior.

<h3>French Tunisia Declares Loyalty to Italy; Governor-General Peyrouton Speaks</h3>
<p>French Tunisia, North Africa – Governor-General Peyrouton of French Tunisia recently delivered a radio address, saying, "Since my last address, serious accidents have occurred one after another, and the situation has changed dramatically. The new French government is led by the highly respected Marshal Pétain, who, due to the urgency of the situation, has had to consider under what conditions to stop the current slaughter of women and children in a glorious manner. Tomorrow France may even cease fighting, but this will not diminish its glory, and the French Empire will still be unharmed. Our empire's sixty million people will surely restore harmony, justice, and light, and will never shrink back. No one will believe or spread the rumors spread by the enemy. Anyone who dares to spread rumors, use them for enemy purposes, will be punished as a traitor, without leniency. All civil servants should also set an example, remain calm, and not leave their posts without authorization. We have believed in empty words for too long. Today, the country's affairs have been entrusted to the hands of loyal, brave, and patriotic people, who will act with the country as a prerequisite and will surely lead Tunisia out of the suffering of the motherland."

The members of parliament cheered loudly upon hearing this. (Reuters Dispatch of the 20th)</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Air Raid on British Mainland the Night Before Last; Fires in Three Towns in the Northeast; Billingham, a Center of Military Industry, Also Bombed</h3>
<p>London According to responsible sources, the scale of the German aircraft raid on Britain last night, involving over a hundred planes, was unprecedented. Bombs were dropped across the country, and the enemy aircraft apparently changed their attack routes, increasing their attacks on industrial areas compared to the night before last. Several factories suffered damage, but given the large number of bombs dropped by the German aircraft, the extent of the damage was relatively light. Visibility was worse last night than on Tuesday, which was quite advantageous for the German bombers, as it made interception by the British side even more difficult. Furthermore, according to today's news, the British Air Force's attack on the French airfields used by the German forces was very effective. (June 20th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>London The Air Ministry and the Home Office Air Defence Command will jointly issue a public statement stating that enemy aircraft attacked the British mainland again last night, dropping many bombs along the northeast coast, causing considerable damage. Fires broke out in three towns, but the authorities were able to control everything.

<h3>Britain Establishes Defensive Positions Along the Coastline, Heavily Guarded to Prevent Enemy Invasion; Naval Vessels Patrol, Undertaking Outpost Duties</h3>
<p>London Britain completed a 20-mile-deep war zone along the coast last night. Countless defense forces are ready to repel a German invasion of Britain. The British public is not alarmed by the German air raids of the past two nights and has requested the government to issue firearms today in preparation for hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Information Minister Cooper told the nation in a radio broadcast last night, "We will fight with our backs to the wall, but this wall is extremely strong." Last night, coastal troops gathered to prepare to resist the enemy, some of whom had fought with the German forces before. Coastal heavy artillery has been installed, with powerful anti-aircraft guns every mile. Areas suitable for German transport landings have been mined. The British Navy in the English Channel has concentrated a number of destroyers and reconnaissance ships as outposts for the army. The Royal Air Force has also greatly increased its defenses and patrols along the coast to monitor the movements of the enemy's navy. Civilians in the new war zone have been evacuated. The self-defense forces in the copper and iron walls of the war zone continue to train in preparation for attacks by German paratroopers. Private firearms have mostly been handed over to the government for use by the self-defense forces. Britain has conscripted new troops this week, approximately 1.5 million soldiers, to resist a German invasion. Munitions factories across Britain continue to operate day and night to produce large quantities of munitions. Large quantities of supplies shipped from the United States and British colonies are also stockpiled at British docks. (June 20th, Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>U.S. Notifies Germany and Italy; Resolves to Uphold the Monroe Doctrine; Will Not Recognize the Transfer of Territories in the Western Hemisphere; Will Convene a Pan-American Conference in Cuba</h3>
<p>Washington On Monday, when the United States warned Germany and Italy that it would maintain its Monroe Doctrine, Italian diplomats to Latin America issued a notice advocating the convening of an emergency meeting of the twenty-one republics of the Americas. Undersecretary of State Welles declared that the conference of the American republics will discuss the military and economic measures that countries in the Western Hemisphere should take to deal with the situation in Europe. In the notes delivered to Germany and Italy by the U.S. Ambassadors in Berlin and Rome on Monday, it was stated that the United States will not stand idly by if any non-American colony in the Western Hemisphere is transferred to another non-American country. Political observers explained that this statement meant that the United States will take action to prevent Germany or Italy from controlling any French or Dutch territories in the Western Hemisphere. The Secretary of State declared last night that on June 16, Secretary of State Hull instructed the Chargé d'Affaires in Berlin and the Ambassador in Rome to deliver the following note from the U.S. government in writing to the Foreign Ministers of Rome, Germany, and Italy: [The U.S. government is aware that France has requested Germany to offer conditions for a ceasefire. To avoid possible misunderstandings, the U.S. government deems it necessary to state the following.] Based on the U.S. policy on the Western Hemisphere, the United States will not recognize, nor will it permit, any Western Hemisphere territory to be transferred from a non-American people to another, including Greenland. Recall that President Roosevelt expanded the Monroe Doctrine to Canada in a speech he gave two years ago. Currently, Britain, France, and the Netherlands all have many colonies in the Western Hemisphere, and only France has made peace with Germany alone. The United States is most concerned about French territories, including important islands off the coast of Newfoundland, French Guiana, and several islands in the Windward Islands. A State Department spokesperson indicated last night that the United States expects Germany and Italy to reply to the note. However, some officials believe that the totalitarian countries, or one of them, will make a formal official statement. (June 20th, Associated Press Telegram)</p>

Although the United States does not intend to send an expeditionary force to Europe, it has confidence in defending the Western Hemisphere. In other words, when necessary, U.S. troops can go north to Alaska and south to Chile and southern Argentina. (June 19th, Haitong Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Advocates Intensifying Threats Against Vietnam; Repeatedly Makes Four Demands to France; France Has Agreed to Allow Japanese Inspectors</h3>
<p>Tokyo Newspapers here continue to report news about Japan's attention to Vietnam. It is said that yesterday, Minister of Colonial Affairs Koizumi, when meeting with Prime Minister Yonai, suggested that in order to strike at the China aid route, the military is now urging Japan to take appropriate and effective measures. If necessary, force should be used. Asahi Shimbun reported that the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs met with French Ambassador Henry yesterday morning and requested France to prohibit [goods] from passing through Vietnam to Chiang Kai-shek's army. According to the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, French Ambassador Henry informed the Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs that although the shipment of gasoline and motor trucks from the United States to Chongqing is, in fact, a common trade, the French government has taken steps to tighten the prohibition since June 17. It is heard that the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, in order to establish concrete measures to achieve genuine results, hopes that: (1) the Vietnamese authorities will prepare a form listing the gasoline, motor trucks, railway materials, etc. currently in stock for submission to the Japanese authorities at any time; (2) Japanese military officials should cooperate with the Vietnamese authorities to investigate the stored goods and transportation situation; (3) Japanese border patrols will cooperate with officials in Hanoi, Lao Cai, and [an unknown name] to monitor the transport of goods across the border; and (4) if the above measures fail to achieve their purpose, the Vietnamese authorities should close the border.

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang's Speech - Full Text</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Speaking of the recent Japanese</p>
<p>bombing of Chongqing, it can be said that the Japanese have exhausted their greatest and final strength to attack us. The Japanese aim is to believe that Chongqing, threatened by them, will cause our government to waver, our people to feel threatened, and social order to be disrupted, thereby shaking our will to resist and even surrendering to them. That is their goal. Therefore, every time they exhaust their resources, they send at least one hundred and ten aircraft, and as many as one hundred and sixty, to bomb Chongqing. Each aircraft has an average of at least five to seven people. That means the number of people who invade Chongqing with the full force of their air force every day is as high as over one thousand, and at least seven or eight hundred. It really is using their greatest and final strength. And what is our air force doing to resist the Japanese? To be honest, we only need to use a very small number of aircraft from our air force every day, and every time we shoot down or wound a large number of Japanese planes, never letting them return as a complete team. As for these Japanese planes that have been shot down, at least two and as many as five are shot down every day. According to the Japanese own broadcast, in addition to those shot down, each time at least a dozen aircraft are damaged by our air force planes. According to ordinary air force combat theory, at least three fighter planes are needed to fight one bomber plane. But now we only use one fighter plane to fight against five or more enemy bomber planes, and each of our fighter planes has to fight continuously with five times or more of the enemy's strength for three to six hours. This means that our air force engages in five or more fierce battles with the Japanese army every time it takes off. Moreover, after each battle, at least two-thirds of the planes in each team are hit by Japanese gunfire. There was even one time when Comrade Wen Zhi’s plane was hit by ninety-nine bullets plus one shell. In addition, countless planes were hit by more than forty bullets. However, what is the extent of the damage to our air force? It's truly unbelievable. I can report responsibly today that in the two months of combat of our air force, except for a few losses last month, since this month, in the past two weeks, not a single one of our air force soldiers has suffered any significant serious injuries, and not a single plane has failed to return safely after loyally and courageously completing its mission. Just like yesterday, when the Japanese again sent more than one hundred and twenty aircraft to invade Chongqing, we shot down six with only a very small force. This is only based on what has been detected and discovered so far. The number of other planes that were shot down by our army in the distance and have not been identified, and the number of wounded, are not included in the calculation. Therefore, judging from the battle situation in the past few days, we only need to use a very small number of air forces to resist the large number of Japanese planes that invade every day, and we can achieve great results every time. I think that apart from China, there is no other air force in the world that can fight ten against one, and achieve more with less. Now, let's calculate the number of Japanese and our deaths in these air raids. In the past week, on average, four Japanese planes have been shot down by us every day. The valuable and rare air force personnel they have trained at great time and effort die in battle at a rate of at least twenty to thirty people per day. And because Chongqing’s air defense facilities are becoming safer and stronger day by day, and due to the efforts and dedication of general protection and rescue personnel during air raids, the innocent compatriots who are tragically bombed to death, according to the statistics of the past week, range from eight to forty-eight people per day, with an average of no more than twenty people per day. Comparing the loss of life of our ordinary soldiers and civilians with the number of casualties of the Japanese air force personnel, we suffer fewer losses of life than the Japanese. And in terms of material consumption, considering the consumption of Japanese aircraft fuel and bombs, and the destruction of our urban houses and equipment, the Japanese losses are even greater than ours. To sum up, since these air raids, the losses we have suffered can definitely offset the losses of the Japanese. Moreover, the damage and casualties suffered by the Japanese air force actually exceed ours by more than thirty percent. Therefore, the Japanese invasion by air force not only fails to shake us in the slightest, but also results in them not getting what they paid for, and only hastens their own defeat. From this alone, the Japanese should know that using their air force to threaten and subdue our government and people is like shooting at the sky, just wishful thinking. And if our comrades and the military and civilians across the country can all take the spirit of our air force's victory with few over many in these few days to resist the war, build the nation, handle politics, develop the economy, and engage in various social undertakings, and if everyone can be like our air force soldiers, able to use the strength of one person to fight against thirty or even more than one hundred Japanese people, then no matter how the Japanese use all their final strength to try to succeed, they will inevitably be eliminated by us. There is no way we cannot achieve final victory. Secondly, during this air raid, in addition to the air force personnel being able to loyally and courageously exert themselves and truly complete their mission, other party, government, military, and police personnel, as well as youth groups and air raid service teams organized by various sectors of society, protection groups, rescue teams, fire brigades, traffic teams, soldiers, police, and even monk and Taoist teams, can mostly demonstrate the spirit of loyalty, courage, and sacrifice, and fulfill their duties and obligations. This is something that I find very comforting. It can be said to be the most glorious page in our history of resistance. Today, as our victory is getting closer and closer, and as we are about to succeed, if our party, government, military, police, and compatriots from all walks of life can become stronger and more courageous as we fight, we can be confident that not only will the Japanese be defeated, but any country in the world will also understand that the Chinese government and the Chinese people cannot be threatened by any force. All our strength has not yet been fully exerted, especially the senior cadres of various departments, ministries, and offices, who must work harder to fulfill their responsibilities. You must know that the length of our individual abilities and the strength of the nation are to be experienced in such dangerous times and extraordinary circumstances. Therefore, the more critical the moment and the more dangerous the situation, the more we must strive for our spirit and the more intensely we must work. But now there are still a few agencies that seem to be able to relax a little, and they do not even inspect and supervise the work of lower-level personnel, which is completely wrong. Our air force and rescue personnel risk their lives to protect our safety and relieve the suffering of our people. If the responsible comrades in our various agencies, especially the senior officials in various departments and ministries, still cannot do their best, use their time, step up their work, and effectively direct and supervise their subordinates, and fail to exert their talents during this dangerous period, then they have neglected their duties and are not worthy of being the chief officials of modern agencies. You must know that the reason why ordinary civil servants became bureaucrats of a fallen country during the fall of the Qing Dynasty was because they could not remain calm in the face of danger. When they encountered danger, they wavered in their hearts, the order became chaotic, and they even abandoned their posts and fled first. Therefore, they became the government of a fallen country. The officials of our revolutionary government must be able to cultivate their spirit and strive to fight. I hope that all responsible comrades will not miss this opportunity to hone their knowledge and create achievements. Even under the mad bombing of Japanese aircraft, they must be able to use the opportunity, exert their abilities, lead by example, lead their subordinates, improve our work efficiency, and enhance our national strength. In the future, during the Anti-Japanese War, as long as it is related to our duties, the chief officials of various departments and ministries should automatically plan and assist, without waiting for requests from lower-level agencies, the Garrison Headquarters, the Municipal Government, or the Public Security Bureau, in matters such as relief, transportation, and markets. Our主管 officials should automatically study, try their best to deal with the solutions, and seize this opportunity to implement the Three Principles of the People and save the country and the people. In particular, the President of the Executive Yuan, the Military Commission, and the chief officials of various ministries and commissions must distinguish between the situations, double their efforts to promote our business, and do not allow our revolutionary spirit to be relaxed in the face of the Japanese aircraft's fierce flames. The Japanese think that after this bombing, we will feel panic and waver, but they can only destroy our houses and thin tiles, and they will never be able to shake our spirit of resistance. Now, even if our office buildings are bombed by Japanese aircraft, we can use this to inspire our life spirit and step up our work of resistance. Even though the buildings of our National Government are destroyed by Japanese aircraft, we are still holding our weekly memorial service for the Premier within the walls of the National Government. Even if the entire city is completely shattered by Japanese aircraft and turned into ashes, our National Government will still hold all meetings here. We are going to use blood and fire to temper our national intelligence and nourish the vitality of our great nation. In this way, our revolution can be completed and our Chinese nation can forever stand in a steadfast, independent, self-reliant position. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane Raids on Chongqing - More Harm Than Good</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Chinese officials today claimed that each Japanese air raid on Chongqing costs the Japanese 40 million yen, while the losses to the Chinese government and military facilities this summer are minimal. The scale of Japanese air raids on Chongqing this year is greater than any time since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, but most of what the Japanese planes have bombed are old and poorly constructed civilian houses of the local people in western China. This kind of loss makes the Japanese lose more than they gain. Chinese government agencies and factories are scattered in the suburbs of Chongqing and have not suffered losses from Japanese bombing. The factories have moved from the capital to deep caves, beyond the reach of Japanese aircraft bombs. In addition to the loss of civilian houses and shops, this year Japanese planes have bombed and destroyed foreign property in Chongqing. The French St. Paul's Catholic Church and the girls' school run by the church in the suburbs of Chongqing were completely bombed on Sunday. The Christ Adventist Sabbath Church and the Methodist Church run by Americans were destroyed and have not been repaired. An ice factory run by Americans was damaged by bombing on Sunday and was forced to suspend operations this week. The Canadian church was destroyed. German property, including Tongxun News Agency and the German Wohrf Steel Factory, the Soviet Embassy in Chongqing, and TASS were all destroyed. The Chinese government said that after learning from the lessons of the Japanese air raids on Chongqing, it made adequate preparations for the air raids this summer. Even during the Japanese air raids, it continued to work and did not completely shut down. The morale of the people of Chongqing was not affected by the Japanese bombing. Most of the people have already evacuated, and those who remain seek refuge in caves. The people of Chongqing have become accustomed to "bombing life." The reduction in casualties this year proves the effectiveness of air defense. Chinese officials estimate that each Japanese air raid on Chongqing costs the Japanese 40 million yen. This figure is estimated based on the loss of aircraft, the death of pilots, and the consumption of gasoline and bombs. This figure is based on 100 aircraft. However, this year, the Japanese planes that attacked Chongqing often exceeded 100. Chinese military officers estimate that each Japanese air raid on Chongqing requires 70,000 gallons of gasoline, worth 210,000 yen. The bombs dropped by Japanese planes are worth 200,000 US dollars. Each air raid, the Japanese planes lost an average of five aircraft, each worth 300,000 US dollars. In addition to the above-mentioned losses of 30 million US dollars, the Japanese pilot training costs and other expenses totaled 10 million US dollars. Since April this year, Japanese planes have attacked Chongqing an average of 160 aircraft, which is three more than last year. (United Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Chinese Air Force recently announced that from May 20 to June 16, Japanese planes attacked Chongqing a total of 12 times. A total of 29 Japanese planes were shot down by the Chinese side during the air raids. In addition, it was reported that 40 other planes were also shot down, but the wreckage of these planes could not be found. A total of 203 Japanese airmen were killed, and seven Japanese airmen were on board the damaged planes. During these 12 air raids, the Japanese lost 1.1 million and 300 US dollars, while China lost 400,000 and 8,000 US dollars. Only four Chinese fighter planes were shot down, and nine were damaged.

<h3>Foreign Troops Stationed Here Will Not Withdraw; Shanghai Concessions to Maintain Status Quo; Idea of Free City Criticized by All Parties; Rumors Should Not Be Believed</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the European war expansion, some people in this city, who only seek their own interests and disregard the overall situation, are repeating old tunes and even suggesting the establishment of a "free city." The saying that this plan has been discussed by the consular corps is actually a private plan of wishful thinking. The consular corps has not discussed or considered it at all. According to sources from the Public Concession Authority, the consular corps and the Municipal Council are not aware of this matter. According to sources close to the French Concession, the French Concession Authority has never heard of any brewing of the Shanghai Concessions to be converted into a "free city." In addition, various diplomatic authorities stationed in Shanghai that have interests in Shanghai also believe that this is a private proposal. There has been no involvement or contact regarding the so-called "free city" in the Shanghai diplomatic community, and it is believed that the plan will never become a reality, because any changes involving Chinese territorial sovereignty cannot be recognized by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Foreign Defense Forces Will Remain Stationed As Usual</p>
<p>Under the instigation of a certain party, the puppet mayor Fu Xiao'an sent letters to the consuls of various countries stationed in Shanghai, requesting the withdrawal of the defense forces stationed in Shanghai. According to foreign diplomatic authorities in this city yesterday, the British and French defense forces stationed in Shanghai will remain stationed as usual and will not withdraw. The British, French, and Italian defense forces in this city, through the mediation of Admiral Heard, commander of the US Asian Fleet, have decided to jointly maintain the status quo. All incidents that could cause friction have been stipulated and every effort is made to avoid them. Therefore, there is no reason to withdraw.</p>
<p>British Consul Says He Has No Right to Investigate</p>
<p>Mr. George, the British Consul General in this city, said yesterday that he has not yet seen the official letter sent by "Mayor" Fu Xiao'an to the consuls of Britain, France, and Italy requesting the withdrawal of troops. Mr. Fu's letter was written in Chinese, and he has not yet instructed the translators to translate it into English. All he knows comes from the newspapers. In any case, he has no power to speak about the withdrawal of troops. Mr. George said that the question of the withdrawal of troops of any nationality from the two concessions must be decided by the government authorities of those countries, and not by the consul acting on their behalf.</p>
<p>Chinese Side Refutes the Establishment of a Free City</p>
<p>After the suggestion of establishing a "Shanghai Free City" was revealed in the newspapers, all parties have pointed out that it is impossible and would harm the integrity of Chinese territorial sovereignty, which the Chinese government would never agree to. The legal status of the concessions is different from "leased land." To be precise, they are only "residential areas" for foreigners, and sovereignty still belongs to China. This is the first point. Secondly, in terms of the current situation of the concessions, neutrality has already been established, so there is no need to do so. It is even less possible in reality. The consular corps pointed out again yesterday that this plan has no value. Mr. Nirone, the Italian Consul General who is currently the leader of the consular corps, is unwilling to express his views on this matter due to environmental reasons.</p>
<p>Normal Quiet Within the French Concession</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side's ambitions towards Annam were exposed, the situation in the South China Sea has suddenly become tense. In this city, there are also many rumors about the French Concession, which are unfounded. The puppet side's bluffing is definitely an important factor in creating these rumors. As for the situation in the French Concession, according to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency who inquired from sources close to the authorities, "Everything in the French Concession is as usual. The rumors outside are not to be believed." There are even rumors that puppet troops are gathering in the suburbs. According to information from the Chinese in the western suburbs, there have long been puppet troops outside the concessions. More than a dozen Japanese tanks are south of the Jinji Bridge in the South City, which have been common since the Chinese army withdrew. The various rumors are the result of paranoia and nothing more than self-disturbance.</p>
<p>Misunderstanding in the Xujiahui District</p>
<p>The English Great American Evening Post said that today (20th) there was a misunderstanding in the Xujiahui district between three Japanese military policemen and the French Concession police. The incident occurred when the Japanese military police left Jiaotong University (now occupied by the Japanese army) and attempted to cross the border to a refugee shelter on Haige Road nearby. They were stopped by the French Concession police. However, they soon realized that the Japanese military police were within the Japanese military area and allowed them to proceed. When the Japanese military police were stopped, 80 Japanese soldiers arrived at Jiaotong University. It is believed that these Japanese soldiers were sent to strengthen the garrison there. There are rumors circulating today that the Japanese authorities near Xujiahui are planning to block access to the French Concession. However, the French police authorities said that this morning's incident was due to a misunderstanding and has now been resolved amicably. There are many rumors in the city now, and the citizens should ignore them. The Zilin West News reported that the spokesman for the Japanese army in this city replied to reporters yesterday (19th) afternoon that he did not know about the rumors that the Wang's troops were gathering in the South City. He believed that this was a fabrication. The spokesman for the Japanese Embassy also said that he had heard rumors that Japanese vehicles were active near the border of the French Concession and that Wang's troops had appeared in the suburbs of this city, and that the number of these troops had been exaggerated. In fact, these rumors were baseless, and the Japanese authorities had no intention of taking over the French Concession.</p>
<p>No Possibility of Returning Archives</p>
<p>According to the opinion of senior officials of the Municipal Council, the Bureau will feel some difficulties regarding Fu Xiao'an's request to return the Land Bureau archives, because these archives were entrusted to it by the Chinese government, and the so-called "municipality" has not been formally recognized by any country. In general, it is believed that Japan will not be willing to stand aside in this case, and that it is a possible cause of obstructing peace and order in Shanghai. The "Mayor" recently expressed his opinion in an interview with Western reporters that the reason why the Municipal Council refused to hand over the Land Bureau archives was to protect certain foreign businessmen, because these foreigners had come forward on behalf of Chinese properties during the Shanghai War to find out the truth. This case is currently being discussed by various foreign consuls in this city, and many of them do not agree to handing over the land archives immediately.</p>
<h3>Yunfei Fires Drivers</h3>
<p>The labor representatives of the four major taxi companies in this city, Yunfei, Xiangsheng, Yinse, and Tailai, negotiated again with the Yunfei capital representatives regarding the dismissal of 17 people, including driver Xu Binggao, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, but with no results. It was decided that the two sides would negotiate again on the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Cancellation of Haiphong Blockade; Shipping Industry Unable to Confirm; Yisheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson Sailed for Hong Kong Yesterday; Whether to Sail to Haiphong Will Be Decided Upon Arrival in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Japan's southward ambitions, due to France's declaration of armistice, have turned into a more active accumulation. The French authorities, in order to be cautious and defensive, have temporarily blockaded Haiphong in Vietnam, and all ships are prohibited from entering and leaving. There are rumors that the Haiphong blockade has been lifted as of yesterday, but the shipping industry has not confirmed this. Although the Yisheng Wheel of Jardine Matheson departed as usual yesterday, it was limited to sailing to Hong Kong. Whether it can sail to Haiphong will be decided depending on the situation. As for the Southwest postal route, there is no worry about interruption. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rumor That Haiphong Blockade Has Been Lifted</p>
<p>After the sudden changes in Europe, the impact has also caused unrest in the Far East. The fall of Paris and the peace talks in France have made the southward ambitions of ambitious people even more active. Japanese foreign telegrams reported that more than 60 Japanese ships were gathering in the sea off Hainan Island. Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita also issued a final warning to French Ambassador Henri, so the situation in Vietnam is clearly tense. The French authorities, in order to take cautious precautions, announced the blockade of Haiphong from the day before yesterday, prohibiting ships from entering and leaving. Yesterday, it was rumored in this city that the Haiphong blockade had been lifted by the French authorities, but according to inquiries from the Daguan News Agency to the shipping industry, no official telegram has been received, so it cannot be confirmed.</p>
<p>Yisheng Set Sail and Temporarily Sailed to Hong Kong</p>
<p>The British Jardine Matheson Yisheng Wheel in this city was originally scheduled to sail to Hong Kong and Haiphong yesterday morning. The Haiphong passenger tickets that had been sold and the goods that had been loaded for Haiphong were suddenly notified of the closure of Haiphong by the Haiphong branch the day before yesterday, so they immediately processed the refund procedures and the goods destined for Haiphong were also cleared for refund, preparing to suspend sailing to Haiphong. It will be decided after arriving in Hong Kong, it was said. In addition, the Mingsheng Wheel of the company is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 26th and will also temporarily sail to Hong Kong. As for the Taikoo Ocean Wheel Jinan Wheel's export on the 19th, whether it can reach Haiphong must also be decided after the whole port arrives in port. Also, according to news from Hong Kong yesterday, the Hong Kong-Vietnam route was reopened the night before last (19th) due to the cancellation of the Haiphong blockade, but the shipping industry in this city had not received the above news yesterday, and confirmation is awaited.</p>
<p>Southwest Postal Delivery Not Interrupted</p>
<p>As for the postal delivery between Shanghai and Vietnam, it was interrupted the day before yesterday due to the suspension of the ship. Haiphong was originally an important transshipment port for mail between Shanghai and Yunnan, Sichuan and other places. At present, ordinary letters are still sealed and issued as usual, but the Bureau can change the route of mail to the mainland to Zhejiang East when necessary, and load the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to transport to Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan and other provinces for delivery, which is also very convenient, and the time required is similar to that of those via Haiphong, so there is no worry about the interruption of postal delivery between Shanghai and Southwest.</p>
<p>Parcels Via Haiphong for Transshipment Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Parcel Stock Notification No. 208: It has been notified in the Parcel Notification No. 202 that the collection of bulk parcels and bulk small parcel mail to Yunnan and its upper reaches has been suspended. Due to transportation difficulties, all parcels and small parcels of all kinds sent to Yunnan and its upper reaches via Haiphong for transshipment should be temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Establishment of New Organization by the Public Works Department to Manage Special Prices and Suppress Merchant Speculation in Cooperation with the French Concession</h3>
<p>The Price Stabilization Committee for Daily Necessities in the Public and French Concessions has decided to establish a liaison mechanism to adopt cooperative measures to stabilize prices. Dr. P.H.B. Petersen has begun preparations to draft organizational regulations to be submitted to the Public Works Department for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>Cooperate to Stabilize Prices</p>
<p>Mr. Gerber, Deputy General Manager of the Public Works Department, told reporters from the Western press the other day that the Public Works Department has now established an international organization dedicated to investigating market prices and rice prices within the concessions. According to a notice from the Public Works Department, the organization will cooperate with the French Concession Price Stabilization Committee to suppress merchant speculation and profiteering. Mr. Petersen of the Health Department is in charge.</p>
<p>Additional Staff Begin Work</p>
<p>However, whether the results of the organization's price investigations will be used as a standard for price control has not yet been decided. Its responsibility is to clearly investigate the current price situation and create a clear chart as a reference for the Public Works Department to stabilize prices. The organization also has one Japanese staff member responsible for negotiating with the Japanese side on food imports and one Chinese staff member responsible for negotiating with the Chinese side on such issues. The new agency has now begun operations in the Public Works Department building.</p>
<p>French Price Stabilization Committee Inspects Rice Warehouses</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month, the French Concession Price Stabilization Committee and the French Police sent representatives to inspect several rice shops and rice warehouses in the French Concession. The representatives examined documents related to the cost and purchase value of rice and focused particularly on speculation. If the selling price of rice was inconsistent with the cost and purchase value, an investigation was immediately conducted. Currently, a rice subcommittee is seeking ways to improve the rice market.</p>
<p>Blame Deng Che for Soaring Rice Prices</p>
<p>According to financial sources, 8,000 tons of foreign rice were ordered last week, and approximately 20,000 tons (10 quintals per ton) were purchased in June. The total amount of foreign rice imported from January to May was 1,674,610 quintals. Rice sources have been abundant. Even if temporary transportation difficulties arise, they should not affect market prices. Furthermore, supplies from Thailand and Burma are smooth, and foreign exchange has been relaxed. Inland japonica rice has also been transported, so there is no reason for prices to soar. It is hoped that the authorities will thoroughly investigate the continuous rise in rice prices in recent days to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Refugee Area Will Remain Unchanged</h3>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly reported in detail on the Nan Shi refugee area and the plan to disband the refugees by the end of the month. It is now known that the measures for disbanding the refugees, in addition to issuing half a month's worth of food rations as reported in yesterday's newspaper,</p>
<p>Additional Relief Grain</p>
<p>Will be for twenty days, slightly different from what was reported. According to Mr. Xie Shibo, French Deputy Consul, Mr. Tang Na, Director of the Public Works Department, and Mr. Fan'erdi, three persons in charge of the refugee area's aftermath committee, spoke to a visiting reporter from the News Agency yesterday. The aforementioned food rations, totaling thirty-five days, are a proposal from the General Affairs Office, and the Aftermath Committee is still</p>
<p>Under Discussion</p>
<p>It has not yet been officially approved and announced. The supply of food to all refugees will continue until the end of this month. Once the Aftermath Committee approves the amount of relief grain to be distributed to each refugee, the General Affairs Office will be notified to proceed accordingly. The future of the refugee area is of great concern to all sectors. According to inquiries, although the refugees housed in the area will be quickly disbanded, the status of the refugee area will not be changed. Father Jacquinot established the area as a safe zone. The name "refugee area" is merely a customary term used by the people of Shanghai. At the time, both China and Japan agreed. Therefore, the future status of the area will not be changed.</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Surge in Rice Prices, Treacherous Merchants Manipulate, Public Security Prospects Worrying, Price Stabilization Committee to Discuss Price Stabilization Today</h3>
<p>The entire food supply in Shanghai is being manipulated and monopolized by speculators, causing japonica and indica rice prices to rise sharply in recent days. The highest price has broken the new record of seventy-four yuan. Small citizens have suffered severely. The Public Works Department has decided to select staff to work with the French Concession Price Control Committee to handle the matter in order to crack down on illegal profiteering in rice. It is now learned that the Shanghai Bean and Rice Trade Association has scheduled a joint meeting of the interim executive and supervisory committees for 3:00 p.m. today as a precautionary measure. At that time, the entire food issue will be addressed in detail to stabilize prices and suppress illegal transactions.</p>
<p>Price Stabilization Committee to Meet Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has repeatedly handled the stabilization of tribute rice, with remarkable results, greatly benefiting the common people. In view of the continuous rise in rice prices in recent days, which not only affects the overall security within the concession, but also makes it impossible for ordinary citizens to make a living, forcing them to take risks. However, due to financial constraints, it is impossible to continue the main undertaking. In order to expand operations and discuss solutions, it has been decided to hold a full committee meeting at 3:00 p.m. today at the Shipping Club, 93 Guangdong Road. It is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate funds to ensure that the stabilization of tribute rice can be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Unprecedentedly High Prices, Early Market Closure</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the rice shop tea market opened as usual at 7:30 a.m. A group of rice speculators, citing Hong Kong's ban on rice exports and the impending interruption of foreign rice supplies, were unwilling to easily sell their inventories and were determined to spread rumors. As a result, japonica and indica rice prices soared to unprecedented levels, rising by as much as five or six yuan compared to the previous market. In addition to closely monitoring market conditions, the Market Management Committee immediately sent personnel to monitor buying and selling by colleagues in the market and to prevent illegal transactions. However, it was difficult to stabilize public sentiment for a while, and the market had to be closed early.</p>
<p>No Fear of Interruption of Foreign Rice Supply</p>
<p>A reporter from New Voice News learned from relevant sources yesterday that Hong Kong's ban on rice exports only applies to a portion of the trade. Licensed rice merchants can still export rice. According to rumors, Shanghai's sea defense navigation has been restored, so there is no fear of interruption of foreign rice supplies. Furthermore, the rice inventories in Shanghai's warehouses are also very substantial. The market transactions of various goods on a daily basis have no obvious connection with daily international market prices. Yesterday morning's surge in rice prices was clearly caused by rice speculators. According to rice industry sources, even if the sea defense is officially sealed off, sources from [illegible] and other places can still [illegible] offset the effects, only slightly extending the time required [illegible].</p>
<p>French Public Works Department Inspects Rice Warehouses</p>
<p>It is learned that the French Concession Public Works Department's Price Stabilization Committee and the French Police dispatched representatives to several rice shops and rice warehouses within the concession the day before yesterday to prevent rice shops from raising rice prices without authorization. The representatives examined documents related to the cost and purchase value of rice and paid particular attention to speculation. Whenever the selling price of rice was inconsistent with the cost and purchase value, an inspection was immediately conducted. Currently, a rice subcommittee is seeking ways to improve the rice market.</p>
<h3>Tongfeng Bank Organizes Shangyu Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>Tongfeng Bank on Tianjin Road in this city was founded by Zhang Quankang and others from Shangyu County, Shaoxing, and is particularly enthusiastic in supporting charitable causes. It is now learned that Zhang Quankang, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the bank, considering the severe famine in his hometown, with people starving in the wild and infants being abandoned, is particularly pitiful. He has specially joined with enthusiastic fellow villagers to initiate the organization of the Shangyu Disaster Relief Association. It is hoped that those from Shangyu residing in Shanghai will generously donate funds.</p>
<h3>Erratum</h3>
<p>In the news item "British, Italian and German Merchants in Shanghai Mutually Prohibit Commercial Exchanges" published in this newspaper on June 15, "Tianxiang Foreign Firm" was a mistake for "Tianli Foreign Firm." This is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>British Residents' Association Holds General Meeting, Actively Urging British Residents to Serve Their Motherland, French Children Sell Old Newspapers to Donate Money</h3>
<p>On Tuesday of this week, the British Residents' Association held a general meeting. All members attended and enthusiastically discussed various issues concerning wartime measures and resolved to do their utmost to cooperate with the recently established Wartime Thrift Association to serve the country. The Association also hopes to cooperate with the British Council to raise donations from British residents in China and will soon publish a statement to actively awaken overseas residents to do their utmost for their motherland. In addition, it was decided to organize a special group to study various wartime measures and to encourage members to work hard to expand the scope and increase the number of people in the group in order to generate significant results. Finally, it was decided to establish a wartime committee and nominate Mr. Haynes Wilson, Jones Dunn, Parass, Arnold, and Mrs. Jones as members.</p>
<p>French Residents Mourn Fallen Soldiers</p>
<p>Today (Friday), French residents in this city will hold a memorial service for fallen soldiers at the Luban Road Church. In addition, French children in this city, considering the high price of old newspapers in Shanghai, collect old newspapers and sell them, donating the proceeds to their motherland. In January, they only obtained 14 yuan and 71 cents. In February, this increased to 100 yuan. In March, it increased to 180 yuan. In April, it was 400 yuan. In May, it was 982 yuan. To date, a total of 9,056 catties of old paper have been collected, worth 1,727 yuan and 51 cents. Recently, a Westerner came to Shanghai and described the economic situation in Germany, stating that the majority of skilled workers at the German Siemens-Halske electrical manufacturing plant are less than half of what they were before the war. Therefore, the production of various manufactures has also [illegible] decreased. In order to attract workers, the Junkers aircraft factory only requires twelve weeks of training in various trades before workers can enter the factory to work. Heavy industry also employs a large number of women. Recently, shipbuilding factories have advertised to recruit female workers. Another proof of the shortage of workers is that people who were previously considered unsuitable for work are now serving in various industries. There is an organization called the "Labor Front" in the country, which no citizen can oppose, but since 1934, work has gradually shown signs of fatigue. The Ruhr armaments factory previously needed 2,000 workers, but now it needs to hire 3,000 to maintain its original production. Although working hours have increased to 60 hours per week, authoritative estimates suggest that in the summer, women in the fields work 16 to 17 hours a day, accounting for 70 percent. As for German currency, in 1933, the average amount of paper money and currency circulating in the country was 80 marks per person. In May 1939, the amount of paper money issued was 11.5 billion marks. In just one month, it increased to 16 billion marks.</p>

<h3>Tram Increases Burden on Passengers, Why Not Crack Down on "Grease," Draining the Blood and Sweat of Many Taxpayers, Why is the Authorities So Generous to Public Utilities?</h3>
<p>The Chinese-language edition of the North China Daily News yesterday carried a letter from a reader stating that with the value of legal tender having risen sharply, the Shanghai Tram Company announced that it would increase fares again from the 17th of this month. This is the second time the company has "revised" its fares in less than six months. The fare from Hartung Road to Henan Road, formerly eight cents, is now twelve cents.</p>
<p>An Increase of Fifteen, the high percentage increase, is the same as the repeated "revisions" of prices charged by other public utilities in the city, coupled with the hoarding and price gouging by unscrupulous merchants, has drained the blood and sweat of many taxpayers. Whenever any public utility company decides to request</p>
<p>An increase in charges, the authorities invariably allow it. This seems inconsistent with the Public Works Department's recent policy of cracking down on hoarding and profiteering. Tram ticket sellers are notorious for "greasing" their palms. This [illegible] habit is a disgrace to the tram company's management. The company must suffer considerable losses every year as a result of this, but has not taken effective action to eliminate it. Therefore, whatever excuse the tram company's management uses to increase fares again, it should first put an end to the "greasing" of its ticket sellers' palms.</p>
<h3>Xu Chengxu's Coffin Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Chengxu, a reporter for this newspaper, passed away at his residence the day before yesterday due to illness. Heaven has taken away a talented young man, and his ambition has died with him. Friends and colleagues are deeply shocked and saddened by the news. Mr. Xu's remains were placed in a coffin yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Extreme Mourning Yesterday, in the morning and afternoon, Mr. Xu's friends, acquaintances, and colleagues visited the Hai Funeral Parlor to pay their respects, numbering several hundred people. Wreaths and elegiac couplets were sent from all sides, covering the surroundings, in extreme mourning. Mr. Xu's remains were placed in a coffin at 4:00 p.m. His wife and two sons cried loudly, the scene was extremely desolate. The coffin was then moved to the Yangzhou Guild Hall on Daxilu Dunxinlu.</p>
<p>Filial Piety Xu Chengxu was naturally filial. Several years ago, his elderly mother was very ill. In addition to hiring doctors to treat her, Xu saw that his mother's condition was worsening. He often personally served her medicine, unable to sleep at night, and once secretly cut flesh from his thigh to treat her. Fortunately, his mother's condition turned from danger to safety, and he was relieved. His filial piety is particularly admirable and worthy of emulation in these declining times.</p>
<h3>Being Sued for Unpaid Tuition Fees, A Strange Phenomenon in Education</h3>
<p>Liu Shusheng, a native of Ningbo living at No. 267, Jinyu Lane, Mintini Road, is currently a medicine peddler. He has two daughters, the eldest named Fengying (15 years old) and the younger named Yunying (12 years old), both studying at Zhendong Elementary School at the intersection of Glock Road and Pi Shao Nai Road. Fengying is a fifth-grade student and Yunying is a third-grade student. Both students are extremely intelligent and always rank first in examinations. However, due to the impact of the war, Liu's circumstances are extremely miserable, resulting in both students' tuition fees for this semester, totaling 21 yuan, being unpaid. He repeatedly wrote to the school requesting an extension. As a result, the school did not understand, and the principal, Fan Shenxiong from Wuxi, provided a guarantee to the Second Special Court requesting a provisional attachment, and Liu's household furniture was sealed. At the same time, a lawsuit was filed in the civil court to demand payment of tuition fees totaling 21 yuan in national currency. The case was heard yesterday in the Fourth Court by Judge Shen Youqi. The plaintiff, Fan Shenxiong, testified about the incident. The defendant, Liu Shusheng, admitted that the tuition fees were indeed owed and that he had borrowed money from relatives and friends and planned to pay half first, but the plaintiff insisted on paying in full at once. After deliberation in court, the judge ordered both parties to go out and settle the matter amicably and adjourned the hearing to another date.</p>
<h3>Two Suspects in the Dissected Female Corpse Case Released, Shen Weihui Still Detained</h3>
<p>Huang Jinxiu, a female worker from Pudong who worked at the Shanghai Japanese Cotton Mill on Yangshupu Road, was murdered and dissected on the 10th of this month [illegible]. After the relevant police station arrested the suspects Sheng Hongsheng, Ding Xiufa, and the already released Wu Cheng and Gu Licai from Changzhou, and subsequently arrested Shen Weihui from Chongming, who hated the task force and sent a letter falsely accusing Gu Yansheng, the principal of Fenzhou Elementary School on Fenzhou Road from Haimen, of instigating the murder of Huang, they were successively escorted to the First Special Court. During the postponement, the police found that the murderer of Huang was someone else. The two suspects arrested, Sheng and Ding, were unrelated. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the third criminal court trial. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated the previous situation and requested a postponement for Shen Weihui. Judge Jiang briefly questioned the defendants and ordered Sheng Hongsheng and Ding Xiufa to be released. Shen was detained and the case was adjourned for further review.</p>
<h3>Gun Murder of Wu Qilun, Suspects Retract Previous Confessions, Shooting and Killing After Robbery Attempt Fails, Adjourned for Further Hearing on the 29th</h3>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan and his apprentices Qiao Yaoshan and Zheng Changchun, etc., were accused by Xia Guifu and others, the murderers of lawyer Wu Qilun, of being the instigators and were arrested by the Central Police Station on charges of instigating murder. The case has been repeatedly investigated and tried by Judge Feng Shide of the First Special Court. The murderers firmly stated that Gu, Qiao, and Zheng resented Wu Qilun for damaging their reputation and offered a reward of 2,000 yuan to have Wu killed. The public sentiment has been reported in the news. The case was heard again by Judge Feng in a special court at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Unexpectedly, the defendants Xia Guifu, Wei Shoulin, Wang Xingfang, and Xia Shoufeng completely retracted their</p>
<p>Confessions</p>
<p>Stating that they had originally formed a gang and carried weapons to rob lawyer Wu Qilun of the diamond ring on his hand. Because he (Wu Qilun) refused to hand it over and instead locked them in the room, preparing to report them to the police, they were anxious and ordered Xia Guifu to shoot him to death. Judge Feng checked the confession and sternly questioned the main culprit Xia Guifu: "You have been repeatedly questioned in this court, and you have been repeatedly advised in advance that this is a murder case, not child's play. You yourselves have violated the criminal law and should be punished by the national law. You must not falsely accuse others out of spite. You firmly stated that Wu Qilun was Gu Zhuxuan's enemy and that Gu paid 2,000 yuan in reward to his apprentices Qiao and Zheng to find you to kill Wu and vent his anger. Why are you suddenly completely retracting your confessions today?" Defendant Xia confessed:</p>
<p>Requesting the Presiding Judge's Forgiveness</p>
<p>"We were initially imprisoned in the police station, and because of all kinds of unspeakable pain, we had to lie. Now we are detained in prison, and we are very free and have no pain at all. Since there is no physical pain, why should we harm others?" The court checked the confession and questioned the defendant Zheng Changchun, who remained silent. Zheng's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, immediately stood up and requested that Zheng be transferred to the Western Prison. Judge Feng checked the circumstances and ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody and adjourned the hearing to the 29th of this month.</p>
<h3>Zhongshan Native Place Association in Shanghai Handles the Reburial of Deceased Fellow Villagers</h3>
<p>The Zhongshan Native Place Association in Shanghai's Reburial of Deceased Fellow Villagers Council recently reported that there are still more than a thousand coffins and bone towers of deceased fellow villagers from Zhongshan stored at the Guangzhao Old Cemetery in Chedaijiao. It is reported that the reburial of these coffins and bone towers is also limited to before the end of this month, otherwise they will be cremated. All coffin owners are hereby notified that if they wish to rebury the remains themselves, they must contact the association's temporary office at the Xiangmao Foreign Firm Accounting Room, 4th Floor, 20 Guangdong Road, before June 28 to discuss the matter of collecting bones and moving coffins. Otherwise, the association will hire workers to transport them to the new cemetery for a mass burial.</p>
<h3>Old Man Camping Out in Alleyway, Thugs Attempt to Rob and Murder, Throat Cut, Life in Danger</h3>
<p>Jiang Yunhong, an elderly man from Jiangxi, 62 years old this year, came to Shanghai alone from Jiangxi a month ago to visit friends and stayed in a hotel. His travel expenses are now almost exhausted. Because the weather has been hot recently, in order to save money, he changed to camping out in the alleyway the night before yesterday. At about 5:00 a.m. yesterday, Jiang, wearing a gray cloth gown, was camping out at the entrance of Lane 785, Julada Road, when thugs cut his throat with a knife, causing him to bleed profusely and his life to be in danger. After being discovered, someone reported the incident to the police station, who sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. An investigation was launched to determine the cause of the attack. It is said that Jiang had 25 yuan in cash on him, which caught the eye of the thugs, leading to this tragedy.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stated that the weather around Shandong is sunny and hot, with southeasterly to southwesterly winds. Here and the coastal areas south of Ma'an Island are cloudy, hot, foggy, and have southeasterly to southwesterly winds. There is thunder in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River.

<h3>Ministry of Education Issues Order to All Provinces to Support Education for Muslims, Must Eliminate Prejudices and Provide Substantial Subsidies</h3>
<p>(Guilin Airmail) The Guizhou Provincial Government received a telegram from the Ministry of Education, stating that according to Bai Chongxi, Chairman of the China Islamic National Salvation Association, in the past ten years or so, Muslims in various places have made efforts to either contribute public assets or private wealth to establish Muslim elementary schools as much as possible and strive to promote them in order to make them widespread. Due to limited financial resources, progress has been very slow. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, this association has undertaken the important mission entrusted by the central government to assist the government and lead Muslims across the country to participate in the national construction work. It is increasingly felt that developing Muslim education is the most urgent need at present. A plan for the development of Muslim education has been drafted and submitted to the ministry, which has been adopted separately, and it has been approved that the establishment of elementary schools should be prioritized. The provincial education departments should urge each county's mosques to establish elementary schools attached to them, and the necessary funding should be subsidized by compulsory education. However, officials in the provincial and county governments and education bureaus may have failed to understand the ministry's intention [illegible] and are bound by past Han-Muslim prejudices. When Muslim schools apply for subsidies in accordance with regulations, the ministry makes excuses to refuse them, and even imposes registration conditions, thereby suppressing them. Now that the Muslims across the country all know that the ministry is vigorously promoting Muslim education, if the stipulated subsidy measures cannot be implemented, it will be impossible to console the hopes of the Muslims across the country. If they are suppressed because the registration conditions are not fully met, it is tantamount to destroying the existing budding Muslim education. It is now proposed to request the issuance of an order to all provincial education departments to instruct the county governments and education bureaus to (1) comply with the regulations and provide actual subsidies to Muslim elementary schools; (2) grant special flexibility for the registration of Muslim elementary schools or temporarily postpone registration and refrain from suppressing them; and (3) local education officials must understand the meaning of sincere unity and eliminate Muslim prejudices, etc. Apart from the second item, which may be considered later regarding temporary postponement of registration and refraining from suppression, the rest are essential and should be approved for implementation. The provincial government received the telegram [illegible] and has already instructed its subordinates to comply.</p>

<h3>Taixian Raises 100,000 Yuan to Support Elementary School Teachers</h3>
<p>(Taixian Dispatch) Since Mr. Han Wenqing took over as the director of the Taixian Education Bureau, he has spared no effort in planning educational administration and promoting educational undertakings. Recently, with the soaring prices and the increase in the cost of living, Mr. Han, feeling sorry for the low salaries and difficult lives of elementary school teachers, has made efforts to appeal for relief. He has gained the sympathy of Mr. Li Mingyang, Commander-in-Chief of the Guerrilla Forces in the Tri-Provincial Border Area, Mr. Qiu Liqi, Magistrate of Taixian County, and people from all walks of life. Last year, Mr. Li, Commander-in-Chief, donated 10,000 yuan on his own. Recently, Mr. Li and Mr. Qiu, the County Magistrate, launched a fundraising campaign of 100,000 yuan. Three million yuan had already been allocated before the end of the lunar calendar's Dragon Boat Festival. Currently, in addition to continuing to urge the raising of the remaining seven million yuan, Mr. Han is also working hard to request an increase in the education land tax from the higher authorities as a long-term plan. According to the fundraising relief, the President had originally stated in the secret telegram from Chongqing on January 16 of this year. As for the request to increase the land tax to maintain permanence, on May 1 of this year, the entire county's 600 teachers and 20,000 students specially made silver shields and silk banners to present to Mr. Han in commemoration of his second anniversary in office, as an expression of cherishing virtue and admiring merit.</p>

<h3>Grain Prices Are Truly Starving People: Rice Prices Rise by Six or Seven Yuan, Although There Was a Slight Reversal… Prices Still Rose by Four or Five Yuan. Maritime Transport Is Still Possible… Mostly Siamese Rice Is Being Shipped. At Yesterday's Prices… Three Sheng of Rice Would Cost Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The laissez-faire attitude towards the rice market, without any regulation, has allowed a basic necessity for the public to become a tool for speculation. Yesterday's price surge broke all previous records, reaching unexpectedly high levels. Whether in the open or black market, prices soared by a massive six or seven yuan. All types of imported rice, except for broken rice and rice tea, have crossed the sixty-yuan mark. No. 1 aged Saigon reached sixty-six yuan, and it is rumored that the off-market prices for various thick and thin Japonica rice exceeded seventy yuan. Changbang special clear Japonica rice reached seventy-five yuan. This unfortunate situation is entirely due to speculative rice merchants using rumors of a naval blockade and Hong Kong's exit restrictions, moving in and out, trying to manipulate prices by first hoarding and then releasing, causing widespread panic in the market. Clients from inland Zhejiang, Shaoxing, and other regions, as well as rural customers, were caught off guard. They rushed to sell at the beginning of the day, frantically trying to get rid of their rice regardless of the price or quality, as if overjoyed to be rid of it. This created an opportunity for those with goods to quote exorbitant prices, shouting out prices of several yuan at a time. Speculators also used their manipulative tactics, blindly following the trend, leading to a continuous jump in prices. The chaos in the market was beyond description, and selling prices reached unprecedented highs. No. 1 aged Saigon reached sixty-six yuan, No. 2 sixty-three yuan seven jiao, sixty-three yuan five fen, Fire-milled sixty-four yuan five jiao, sixty-four yuan, No. 1 Siamese sixty-five yuan six yuan, No. 2 sixty-three yuan five fen, Xiaowen Bank sixty-two yuan five fen, Pudong Bank sixty-two yuan, Tokyo polished top sixty-two yuan, while mixed broken rice and rice glutinous rice rose together. High-quality broken rice started at fifty-five yuan and then fell to fifty-three yuan, glutinous rice fifty-eight yuan. At this point, general retail sales stopped, and floating hoards were also released at high prices, causing the market to suddenly turn downwards. The reaction at the time was strong, and prices plummeted by more than two yuan. Xiaojiao Silver Bank only quoted sixty yuan five jiao, Pudong Bank sixty yuan. Unexpectedly, the lower prices suddenly attracted buying from hoarding clients, and the situation quickly recovered, with prices rising by one yuan again. The result of the close was that Xiaojiao rose to sixty-one yuan five jiao, sixty-one yuan, a sharp increase of six yuan compared to the morning's opening price, and about four yuan higher than the afternoon's increase the day before. Shen Ji threw out 750 tons of No. 2 Saigon arriving today at a price of seventy-three yuan, causing a temporary decline. After several rises and falls in the afternoon and evening, No. 2 Saigon and Siamese rice closed at sixty-four yuan to sixty-three yuan two or three jiao, Xiaojiao from sixty-three yuan to sixty-two yuan four jiao, still a significant four or five yuan higher than the night before. Original packaged Xiaojiao rice was retrieved at sixty-four yuan, Saigon No. 1 at sixty-eight yuan. Morning opening six yuan to sixty-five yuan nine jiao five fen, afternoon opening 18 packaged sixty-seven yuan eight yuan, 26 packaged sixty-six yuan, each up four to five yuan, blockade interruption rumors have all been proven false. Saigon telegraphed in the evening that unloading was continuing as normal, but the number of ships had indeed decreased, but the source of Siamese rice had not been affected, and the Siamese rice stored in the city was not a small amount.</p>
<p>Another ten thousand six hundred and fifty bags of imported rice arrived yesterday, transported from Hong Kong by Jardine Matheson's Lishun wheel, docked at the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession, and unloading began last night. It is said that three thousand bags will be shipped to Fujian today.</p>
<p>Japonica and glutinous domestic rice, in this environment, were also similarly stimulated. Rumors of off-market trading in Japonica rice also mutually influenced each other, causing abnormal surges. The situation was even more favorable for these goods than for others. Changbang special clear Japonica rice dropped from a high of seventy-five yuan to seventy-four yuan, Suzhou Kunshan Changzhou white Japonica rice seventy-three four yuan, next to Susu Re rice seventy yuan, Qing Si special thin rice seventy-two three yuan, Zhongguan seventy-one yuan, Nangang early and late rice seventy yuan sixty-nine yuan. Glutinous rice, due to its low price and good quality, was highly sought after. Jinyi special Yuan, the market has opened to the sixty-yuan mark, and even Chang Dan goods require fifty-eight nine yuan, Jiangbei Yuan about fifty-seven yuan. Statistics show that both Japonica and glutinous rice increased sharply by five or six yuan, and a total of one thousand three four hundred bags arrived at the port. Storefront sales of No. 1 Saigon were fifty-nine yuan. The high price of glutinous rice is partly due to the recent mixing of glutinous rice in imported rice. It is said that in a certain place in western Zhejiang, glutinous rice and Dongshuang rice were already being sold together.</p>
<h3>Flour and Rice Markets Follow Suit, Yesterday Holding Steady, Expecting Further Increases</h3>
<p>The flour market remains quietly firm. The No. 2 flour mill's price is still thirteen yuan eight jiao. In order to maintain the business in this street, various factories are only limiting sales to small, retail quantities, unable to fully supply. The same is true for sales to northern and southern clients. Total market transactions amount to over ten thousand bags. It is said that the Nanyang group, seeing the sudden tension in Vietnam and fearing disruptions to Hong Kong shipping, dared not to take further action. However, yesterday's news of Hong Kong's ban on rice exports and the surge in rice prices added another layer of strength to flour prices. As a result, old Che stations and inland flour have been holding steady, expecting further increases. The market outlook is therefore likely to rise rather than fall. Five thousand bags of flour are scheduled for shipment to Fujian on the 20th, and another fifteen thousand bags on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<h3>Yarn Market Plunges by Over One Hundred Yuan, Double Horse Reaches a New Low of Nine Hundred and Fifty Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the price decline is intensifying. This is because unrest in the South China Sea has disrupted shipping lines from Hong Kong to Haiphong, leading to a temporary halt in loading, causing concern among Guangbang merchants. No packages of cotton yarn have been processed, greatly impacting confidence. Generally, those with floating long positions are nervous and liquidate, so even though foreign exchange rates have fallen, there is no impact on the market. Yarn prices are therefore declining in a straight line. Twenty count Double Horse yarn has reached a new low of nine hundred and fifty yuan.</p>
<p>The yarn market opened this morning. Due to the report of a naval blockade of Haiphong, people panicked, and sellers were even more eager to sell. The price of twenty count Double Horse yarn was one thousand and fifty yuan, then rose to one thousand and sixty yuan. In an instant, sellers came one after another, and the market became smaller and smaller, breaking the one thousand yuan mark. The closing price was nine hundred and seventy-two yuan. It is estimated that a total of 1,730 bales were traded during the half-day. The price of twenty count Double Horse yarn fell by one hundred and thirty-five yuan. Four hundred and twenty pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong today, two hundred and twenty-five pieces to Weihaiwei, and forty-five pieces to Tianjin. The amount purchased by each trade group is listed below:</p>
<p>Counterparts 1,460 Ningbo 270 Total 1,730</p>
<h3>If Yarn is Unstable, the Cotton Market is Even More Stagnant</h3>
<p>Cotton trading has ceased because the yarn market is unstable and has plummeted. Twenty count Double Horse yarn has hit a new low for the last half year. As a result, factory demand is even clearer. As for those in the trade, everyone has plenty to eat and is unwilling to do business in the current environment, so the situation is effectively deadlocked.</p>
<p>Another report states that the price of imported cotton and fine yarn cotton rose at the start of the morning session due to speculative buying, then closed higher than the previous day by more than ten pounds due to Wall Street's purchasing. Indian lint is predicted to fall by five rupees.</p>
<p>Shanghai imported cotton trading, it is rumored that Jardine Matheson has ceased shipments to Haiphong, so yarn prices have plummeted, but exchange rates are tight, and raw cotton prices have increased in value. However, trading is very thin, becoming a dead market. Overseas cotton markets are rising, but they have failed to stimulate confidence.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Calm and Stable, Foreign Stocks Slightly Weakened</h3>
<p>The securities gray market was very stable yesterday, but there were more declines than increases. The market lacked excitement and was not depressed. Since August 13th, most of the various public bonds held by Shanghai banks have been transported to the mainland for storage, so the number of securities in the market is limited, significantly reduced from before. The river surface is narrow, and the waves are naturally small. Furthermore, various rumors and dangers since the third year have been turned into safety, and they have safely passed through. Therefore, those who take long positions are bolder. However, with excessively high interest rates, even if the market price does not fall, those who take long positions lose a lot of money, and those who short sell use this to further put pressure on the market price. Now that the ninth installment of interest is about to expire, as long as there are no unexpected rumors, the market price should still rise, but the amount will definitely be limited. Yesterday, Jiufeng bought in throughout the day, while Datong sold out throughout the day. Numbers 4, 12, and 38 all sold out. Although Hongkang and Lianyi bought in, the market price still failed to increase. The result of the fluctuation was that, except for which has not been traded for four days, the rest fell by about a jiao, while improved by five fen. The total volume traded was about 600,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 12 shares of Zhejiang industry shares were traded at a price of 77 yuan five fen.</p>
<p>The stock market at the Public Chamber of Commerce was slightly weakened yesterday, as many holders of floating long positions liquidated. There was not much change in prices. Jardine Matheson shares fell by two yuan compared to the opening price due to the decline in yarn prices. Rubber shares were still ignored, with only slight short covering activity.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Wednesday) report: Today's stock market for British Far East companies showed continued weakness in bank shares. Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China shares fell two shillings six pence to seven pounds seven shillings six pence, Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation London registered shares fell four pounds to seventy pounds, Hong Kong registered shares fell three pounds to seventy-five pounds. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Wednesday) report: Today's Chinese foreign debt market remained stable, with no changes in any debt. Trading in the Sino-French US dollar 5% bonds will be suspended from today, and prices will not be quoted for the time being.</p>

<h3>Profiteers Cash Out at High Prices: Gold Prices Fluctuate Wildly, Reaching a High of 5,900 Yuan Before Noon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash "Haxia" (arbitrage) market was a case of starting strong but ending weakly. High prices were unsustainable, leading to a gradual decline and a general lack of momentum. It was mainly due to a large number of people taking advantage of the high prices to sell short. Although intermediaries from various guilds tried to absorb the selling pressure, the sellers' power was overwhelming, and the supply of gold was quite ample. Furthermore, negative news spread in the afternoon, weakening market sentiment. Initially, the morning saw tight exchange rates, and Qian Dui Ye (money exchange shops) and banks aggressively buying, pushing the price to 5,900 yuan twice. Subsequently, a certain gold firm repeatedly sold short, and even long-term holders came out to sell, suppressing the price slightly. The noon closing was only 5,775 yuan. The situation was relatively stable in the early afternoon, but many large holders had not finished cashing out. Although a certain gold firm took the opportunity to profit by covering their short positions, they still felt apprehensive. The price once retreated to 5,650 yuan, but ultimately closed at 5,680 yuan, down 60 yuan from the previous day. The total trading volume for the day was over 4,000 taels. Jewelry gold in silver shops initially rose and then fell, ultimately declining slightly by ten yuan. Gold held by customs remained unchanged.</p>
<p>"Haxia" Falls Back 60 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially saw strong buying due to soft exchange rates, jumping 140 yuan. Qian Dui Ye bought 20 taels from a gold firm at 5,880 yuan. Subsequently, as Qian Dui Ye continued buying and banks also absorbed, the price rose another 20 yuan, with Qian Dui Ye buying 50 taels from a certain gold firm at 5,900 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm suddenly sold short heavily, putting pressure on the market with several hundred taels. Adding to the pressure, securities firms also sold, causing the price to fall back 70 yuan. Qian Dui Ye sold 20 taels to a bank at 5,830 yuan. Subsequently, as exchange rates remained tight, banks aggressively increased their long positions, and sellers temporarily decreased, causing another jump of 70 yuan, returning to the high price of 5,900 yuan. However, exchange rates suddenly strengthened, and gold firms resumed heavy selling, with cash firms also selling. General long holders, seeing the situation, followed suit. By noon, the price had fallen back to below 5,800 yuan. A bank sold 20 taels to a gold firm at 5,750 yuan. Before the close, a bank slightly bought, raising the price by 25 yuan, with the bank buying 30 taels from a securities firm at 5,775 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, Qian Dui Ye initially bought 30 taels from a bank at 5,780 yuan. Unexpectedly, sellers followed in quick succession, as the exchange rate softened. Banks successively cashed out their long positions, and cash firms and Qian Dui Ye also sold to each other. Although gold firms continuously covered their short positions in between, they still felt heavily positioned. Soon, the price plummeted 130 yuan, with a bank selling 10 taels to a gold firm at 5,650 yuan. After this, selling pressure eased slightly, and a certain bank resumed buying, causing a rise of 30 yuan, with banks trading 30 taels with each other at 5,680 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell back 60 yuan compared to the previous day, with a total fluctuation of 250 yuan. The selling price of cash firms' own-brand gold was 10 yuan higher than "Haxia," and the buying price was reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current marked gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. There was little activity in both.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Initially Rises, Then Falls Back</p>
<p>For jewelry gold in silver shops, the initial selling price of each tael at Da Tong Hang (a silver shop) was still listed at 590 yuan. At 9:40 am, it was raised by 20 yuan. At 10:20 am, it fell back 10 yuan. At 11:50 am, it fell back slightly by 10 yuan. At 3:00 pm, it was lowered by 10 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 10 yuan, with Da Tong Hang revising the price to 580 yuan. The new price at Xin Tong Hang (another silver shop) was the same as the above price. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Banks Closed Accounts Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 20th) was the period for banks to settle interest for the first half of the year on current savings and current deposits. Internal procedures at various banks were quite busy. Staff at some banks with large numbers of savings and current account holders had to work until late at night to complete the process. Regarding the closure for account reconciliation, since Mr. Ying Yongyu submitted the matter to the Bankers' Association for discussion, colleagues at Gu Hang (a bank) responded enthusiastically, with over 1,800 people jointly signing letters to the Bankers' Association. The Bankers' Association was reportedly studying the matter after the Silver and Money Industry Amateur Association forwarded it with an official letter for discussion by the Association.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Japanese Merchants Search for Soybeans</h3>
<p>The market for new broad beans was tight due to soaring rice prices and the presence of Japanese merchants searching for supplies. Yesterday, Jiading white-skinned broad beans opened at 20.07 to 20.05 yuan, with 1,340 bags traded. Wuhu small-grain white-skinned broad beans also reached 19 yuan, with 200 bags traded. Beigang green-skinned broad beans also traded at 20.05 to 20 yuan, with over 400 bags traded. The purchases were mainly made by Japanese merchants, with Xinghua local merchants assisting.</p>
<p>In addition, today there were 450 bags of soybeans, 570 tins of raw oil, and 7,000 soybean cakes, all transported to Hong Kong. Another batch of 1,000 soybean cakes was shipped to Fujian yesterday.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Premium Fungus Expensive</h3>
<p>Premium fungus refers to the largest type of black fungus. As there have been no original shipments arriving, merchants are supplying the market with the top layers selected from Sichuan fungus. Therefore, the selling price is high, with the market price yesterday at 500 yuan, a difference of 200 yuan compared to mixed-grade fungus.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Floating Stocks Tend to Be Sold, No Futures Trading</h3>
<p>Fabric Market: Due to the tense situation in Vietnam, Sichuan and Yunnan merchants have stopped procuring goods. Floating stocks tend to be sold, putting pressure on the market, which is trending downward. The price of some white goods has plummeted by 1 to 2 yuan per bolt, and dyed fabrics have fallen by more than 1 yuan. There is no futures trading. Local wholesale shops are handling over 5,000 bolts of grey cloth, bleached cloth, and blue cloth. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants are handling over 100 pieces of fine twill, coarse cloth, and colored cloth. Guangdong merchants are handling over 80 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, and colored cloth. Anhui merchants are handling several thousand bolts of poplin, fine cloth, and colored cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth prices are experiencing panic among industry members and wild fluctuations. The opening price for Longtou fine cloth in the morning market was 30.05 yuan, and Four Gentlemen serge was 8.3 fen per yard. The selling pressure intensified in the afternoon market, and Longtou plummeted to 18.89 yuan. Subsequently, Tianjin merchants searched for supplies, causing a rebound to 29.5 yuan. However, compared to the previous day, it had fallen sharply by about 4 yuan per bolt. Most mid-grade fine cloth and fine twill were not traded, with a price drop of 1 to 2.5 yuan per bolt.</p>
<p>Piece goods exports on the 21st include 110 pieces shipped to Weihaiwei, 40 pieces shipped to Tianjin, and 285 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse Refined White Slightly Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market trend was slightly tighter. The guild set the price for spot goods. The morning price for 24 coarse white sugar from the outer warehouses was 70.08 and 70.09 to 70.085 yuan. The afternoon price was 70.4 yuan, and re-export sugar was 56.3 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. Sugar for delivery on July 2nd was 56.8 yuan. Taikoo refined white B grade from Western warehouses (new goods) was 82.5 to 82 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. Dutch red sugar also rose by the same amount, to 59.7 yuan. For domestic sugar, Jian Bang (a sugar merchant) offered over 100 bags of Taikoo imported "Diao Qing," at 63.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Ball Factory Prices Continue to Rise, 8 Yuan Per Dan</h3>
<p>The price of coal balls yesterday increased by 8 yuan due to rumors in the market related to coastal defense and concerns about the shortage of raw coal dust. The quoted price from the factory is 148 yuan per ton, plus transportation costs for delivery. Retail price at local stores is 8 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>New Arrivals of Sea Products: Sea Cucumber Quickly Sold Out</h3>
<p>Most Western sea cucumbers, such as bare sea cucumbers, are shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. However, the quality varies, resulting in price differences. It is reported that over 100 pieces of Red Sea goods arrived the day before yesterday, with excellent quality and already sold out. The prices are as follows: Premium bare sea cucumber 570 yuan, top-grade bare sea cucumber 520 yuan, large top-grade bare sea cucumber 485 yuan, upper large bare sea cucumber 440 yuan, large bare sea cucumber 396 yuan, large-medium bare sea cucumber 320 yuan, medium bare sea cucumber 295 yuan, small-medium bare sea cucumber 275 yuan, small bare sea cucumber 240 yuan, glossy top-grade bare sea cucumber 405 yuan, black bare sea cucumber 330 yuan.</p>

<h3>A Humorous Tale of Tooth Extraction</h3>
<p>The British consul stationed in Cairo, Egypt, went to see the King of Egypt one day on business. The King was suffering from a toothache, his cheek swollen like a melon, his mouth full of medicated cotton, and he kept groaning. After offering his condolences, the consul said, "Why doesn't Your Majesty have the tooth extracted as a way to cut the weeds and eliminate the roots?" The King raised his head and asked, "Doesn't it hurt?" The consul said, "The doctor uses anesthesia first, so although it hurts during the extraction, you won't feel anything." The King hesitated for a moment, then summoned a dentist. After some conversation to build courage, the King suddenly showed a look of fear! He said, "You say that tooth extraction doesn't hurt, but there is something suspicious. You must first have someone else try it before it can be done." He then summoned a soldier, rewarded him with silver, and explained the situation. The soldier agreed, and the King carefully observed, ordering the dentist to extract the tooth in the soldier's mouth that was causing the same pain as the King's. The dentist restrained the soldier in a chair, and the King stood beside him watching. He saw the doctor apply the anesthesia and extract the large tooth with pliers, without the soldier feeling anything. The King was overjoyed and said, "Wonderful, wonderful!" He ordered his attendants to reward the soldier with wine and dismiss him. Then he sat in the chair to have his tooth extracted. Just as the doctor was about to apply the anesthesia, the King suddenly became greatly alarmed, his face pale, and he jumped up, repeatedly saying, "Not good! Not good! The soldier is young and strong, but I am old and weak, and I fear I cannot bear it." He then summoned a weak woman from the palace to try the extraction. Indeed, she also suffered no pain. Only then did the King dare to sit down again and order his tooth to be extracted.</p>

<h3>Rumor</h3>
<p>—The Front Car</p>
<p>How do rumors arise? First, a rumor originates with a purpose, whether to benefit oneself or harm others. However, to be effective, in addition to creating the rumor, one must first understand the target, attacking their weaknesses so that the rumor can gain traction. For example, when a child cries, the mother shouts that a tiger is coming. The reason the mother doesn't shout "Little Meow" but "tiger" is because the child fears tigers. The child's fear of tigers is their weakness. But this weakness is not enough, because even though the mother shouts "tiger," it is still Little Meow that comes. However, the rumor of the tiger can ultimately deceive the child because the child "trusts" the rumor too easily. He hears "tiger" but doesn't see Little Meow tangled at his feet. Thus, rumors arise continuously, and those who create them succeed continuously.</p>
<p>So, how do we attack rumors? We often use "facts to prove it." But if it's a rumor, why "wait" for facts to prove it? Before the facts prove it, the rumor-monger has already gained benefits in that instant. The constant changes in the speculative market use constant "rumors" to make the "facts" unable to keep up.</p>
<p>Therefore, when a rumor comes before you, you should use sharp eyes, rational judgment, and agile action to extinguish it. For example, if someone suddenly shouts that the neighbor's house is on fire, first identify who is shouting "fire," lest it be a street urchin. What is the neighbor's building made of? There is a big difference between steel-reinforced concrete and a thatched shed. Then immediately jump onto the drying platform to see if it's the left or right neighbor. Wind direction and fire are also related. In this way, if there really is a fire, it's not too late to pack up your valuables. Otherwise, wouldn't it be laughable to cry and shout, panic and rush, grab a pillow and run into the street, only to be laughed at by the street urchins?</p>
<h3>"Only Death, No Life"—Excerpts from a Money-Grubber's Warning to the World</h3>
<p>—Blind Doctor</p>
<p>Since the opening of the so-called "clubs" and "gardens" of the "Bad Earth," the local news columns of various newspapers have frequently added cases of encroachment, running away, and suicide. Even the various supplements often contain texts such as "Confessions of a Gambler" and "The Dying Wails of a Gambler." In theory, seeing so many alarming words in the newspapers should reduce the number of gamblers, and there should be no more unfortunate incidents caused by gambling. However, sadly, there are still so many gamblers. Recently, my old friend, Xin Jun, almost destroyed everything because of this. Fortunately, he woke up early. Although he lost 2,700 yuan, it did not lead to other misfortunes. However, after this setback, he was determined to have me write out the "motives" that cause people to fall into gambling dens as a warning to future generations!</p>
<p>He said: Gamblers are not unaware that gambling dens are devil dens, but the reasons why people often go to their doom are: (1) Curiosity: wanting to see what it's like. (2) Poverty: wanting to skim some cream. (3) Unwise friendships: becoming assimilated over time. (4) A lack of frugality: being unable to make up for a deficit and resorting to a desperate gamble. To avoid such misfortune, one must practice being uninterested, not greedy for small gains, choosing friends carefully, and being frugal. In short, no matter how beautiful their facilities are, how comfortable their services are, and how attentive their attendants are, you should never even think about it, let alone want to eat their free food. To put it more bluntly, how can they "stand" such large expenses if they don't rely on gamblers to send them money? One more thing: even if you don't want to eat free food and don't want to win money, but just want to occasionally play and visit, that is also very dangerous! Because once you get inside, it's really strange: your original idea disappears. I myself am one who fell into the gambling den because of a visit.</p>
<p>In addition, you must keep your eyes open when making friends. Gambling friends must never be made. If an old friend already has a gambling habit, you must not be emotionally moved beyond offering friendly advice. Once you are emotionally moved, you will naturally follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>Frugality is the fortress for our life. If you save and are frugal, and don't waste, then even if you don't "have surplus," you can at least have no worries about food and clothing. If you have no worries about food and clothing, then all adventurous and opportunistic thoughts will not arise. I have seen many friends who committed suicide because of gambling. In addition to the reasons mentioned above for falling into the trap of gambling, they often indulged in gluttony, licentiousness, and roaming, which led to their spending more than they earned, accumulating debt that could not be repaid, and then resorting to gambling, "joining clubs," and entering "gardens" in hopes of a lucky success. As a result, the god of wealth (?) did not help you, the debt increased even more, and you had no face to meet people, so you had to take your own life.</p>
<p>Even ants cherish their lives. Why should we commit suicide for gambling?! So, I want to advise those who don't gamble to always stand firm and adhere to the four points above to avoid repeating the mistakes of those who came before. Those who have gambled, even if they have lost a lot of money, it is like having a serious illness. Don't think about trying to win back the money, because if you don't think about winning it back, then even after a serious illness, although your vital energy is severely damaged, you can still gradually recover. If you are obsessed with "returning the basin" and sink further, I can say with certainty: "Only death, no life."</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Case</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Destination</h3>
<p>—By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Two: "A Page of History!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, his eyes looked at the cheap cigarette holder on the desk. "My bedroom is on the third floor, right next to Jinmei's room. I fell asleep soon after I got into bed and didn't wake up until I was startled by the gunshot. Only then did I realize it was past midnight."</p>
<p>"How did you know the time?"</p>
<p>"When I heard the gunshot, I was still groggy and thought it was the bursting of a rickshaw tire, because I had heard it several times before. But soon after, Jinmei came and knocked on my door anxiously. I got up and looked at the small clock on the dressing table. It was already 12:20. I followed her downstairs, and as soon as I walked in, I saw Lilan in that state. It almost scared me to death!" As he said this, his voice trembled slightly, and a look of surprise leaked out of his bright black eyes.</p>
<p>Hawthorne asked, "Do you know what time your niece came home last night?"</p>
<p>The old man shook his head. "I don't know. She always comes home late at night, sometimes not even coming home at all."</p>
<p>"Did you know the time she came back in the past?"</p>
<p>"Not really. Sometimes I would be awake and hear her open the door and come in. If I was sound asleep, then I wouldn't hear it. As I said, I live on the third floor."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and asked, "Then, besides you, do the two servants know what time she came back last night?"</p>
<p>Li Zhifan hesitated for a moment and replied, "I don't know either. I haven't asked them. But according to Jinmei, she didn't hear Lilan come back either. When we went downstairs, the front door wasn't locked."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly interjected, "I think the old gatekeeper always knows. Should we call him in right away!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne shook his head. "Wait a minute, I have a few more questions to ask Mr. Ji." He took out a cigarette case, offered one to the old man, and lit one himself. "Mr. Li, for the sake of finding out the truth of this case, we can't help but pay attention to all aspects. Now, there is something about your niece's private life that I hope you can answer truthfully." (21)</p>
<h3>Mailing a Letter</h3>
<p>—Gong Guangzhao</p>
<p>I went to the post office to buy stamps to mail a pair of airmail letters. As soon as I got to the post office, I saw that there were a lot of people buying stamps. I thought I would wait until there were fewer people buying stamps before I went to buy them. I leaned against the registered mail counter and watched them send letters. Suddenly, someone patted me on the back. "Sir, are you mailing airmail letters?" He had obviously seen me holding the letters with the airmail stickers on them. I nodded. "Sir, it's so annoying that you can't return the stamps you bought! I originally bought two 3-cent stamps to mail airmail letters, one to Tianjin and one to Hong Kong," the man said incessantly. "There are no airmail routes to Hong Kong," I told him. "Yes, that's why. Now I don't need the 3-cent stamps, and I can't return them. Sir, you're mailing airmail letters, please help me use them." He looked at me pleadingly. I felt very sorry for him and agreed to his request. But when I was about to smear the glue and stick the stamps on the letters, a big secret was revealed to me when I turned the stamps over. On the back of the stamp was a red stain of water, and on the front, there was a subtle black shadow. Two obvious pieces of evidence revealed to me that it was a used stamp. The man, on the other hand, had already run away. I resigned myself to bad luck and bought another stamp. In haste and taking advantage of other people's sympathy, this kind of fraud may be staged every day, so I recorded it to warn those who come after.</p>
<h3>Picture: Dog: What! Always going in and out of my door?</h3>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Entertainment Circle</p>
<h3>What I Saw in "Gone With the Wind"</h3>
<p>—Wei Jun</p>
<p>We know that the movie "Gone With the Wind" is based on the novel "Gone With the Wind." This novel is the famous work of female writer Margaret Mitchell, selling 2 million copies and translated into 16 languages. Because this novel uses the American Civil War as the longitude and the love of sons and daughters as the latitude, Americans especially love to read it. It sold 1.75 million copies in the United States alone. Once it was made into a movie, and it was a long film faithful to the original book, the people of the movie kingdom naturally went crazy.</p>
<p>Since "Gone With the Wind" is a literary film faithful to the original book, we must first have an understanding of the original book before watching the film, or else we will be just following the crowd and the excitement, and we will inevitably miss out on the highlights of the film. If you don't have time to read the original book of 1,037 pages, the minimum you should do is read the story of "Gone With the Wind."</p>
<p>This film is more delicate than great. It vividly depicts the moods of a stubborn and selfish girl, and has the same ingenuity as "Dream of the Red Chamber." There are three points that I see as worth mentioning.</p>
<p>The Excellence of Technique</p>
<p>There are many new techniques used in this film. Several reflective shots have reached the realm of transformation in terms of photographic art. The color is also an excellent achievement, bright but not vulgar, quiet but not obscure, soft but not glaring. These are all things that have not been seen in color films before "Gone With the Wind." The director's technique is also commendable. For example, in the scene where the black slave catches chickens, the black slave greedily grabs the chicken with a bright red comb. The brilliance of the color and the coldness of the interspersion are truly amazing. Another example is the scene where Scarlett kills the straggler. When the gunshot rings out, the straggler's face is covered with blood as he rolls down the stairs. The realism of the scene is heart-stopping.</p>
<p>The Exquisite Acting</p>
<p>Clark Gable, Leslie Howard, Olivia de Havilland, and others are all veterans who have enjoyed fame for a long time, and their acting skills are of course beyond doubt. It's just that Vivien Leigh, who plays Scarlett, has also been on the screen, but has always been unknown. This time, in "Gone With the Wind," she is the most important and hardest worker from beginning to end. Her expressions, shrewishness, resentment, and perseverance bring out the feelings of a tragic woman from ancient times, which cannot be said to be her great success.</p>
<p>The Grandeur of the Sets</p>
<p>The imitation of ancient architecture in Atlanta City, the specially built streets, the towering fire, and the groaning wounded soldiers are scenes that move the audience to almost merge with the screen. Other scenes, clothes, and objects are all true to the era and faithful to the original book. This meticulous attitude, although said to be a consistent style of Hollywood, also requires their strong financial resources and willingness to spend money.</p>
<h3>The Future Trend of the Rising Dramatic Arts Society</h3>
<p>— Shen Qi</p>
<p>The Trend of Spoken Drama is Advancing</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the audience for spoken drama may not seem extensive, but in terms of intellectual enlightenment and emotional grasp, spoken drama is superior to general Peking opera and movies. Recently, the atmosphere of resisting and building the nation has surged, while Peking opera remains stagnant, and movies are stuck in the rut of filming simple folk stories. Consequently, progressive audiences are turning to spoken drama. The popularity of both professional and amateur theater groups is proof of this. Among the professional theater groups, currently, there are only the China Traveling Theater Troupe and the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Society. Not long ago, they were both wavering due to location issues. However, China Traveling Theater Troupe has now renewed its contract for another six months, and the Shanghai Dramatic Arts Society has also decided on its future direction.</p>
<p>The Dramatic Arts Society Decides to Renew the Contract</p>
<p>The Dramatic Arts Society was originally a transformation of the Qingdao Dramatic Arts Society. Later, with the sponsorship of the Sino-French Friendship Association, it changed its name to its current one. Its first performance at the Swatow Theater, the play "Regret of the Late Ming Dynasty," established its high status today. After the five-month lease at Swatow Theater expired, it moved to the Lafayette Theater. The plays "Motherland," "Li Xiucheng's Martyrdom," and "Liang Hongyu" all received praise from public opinion. Their lease with Lafayette Theater is set to expire on the twenty-third of this month, marking the end of their second phase. Originally, the third phase plan was to lead the entire society on a tour to the South Seas Islands. However, due to the European situation, the previous plan was canceled, and it was decided to renew the contract with Lafayette Theater for another six months, starting from the twenty-eighth of this month. However, unlike before, where revenue was split between the front and backstage, the Dramatic Arts Society will now be solely responsible, paying a fixed daily rent to the theater owner.</p>
<p>Changing One Play Per Week</p>
<p>Regarding their third phase plan, in addition to the entire society working together to intensify their core work, they will also train new members to strengthen their lineup. At the same time, there will be changes in the plays performed. They will take a four-day break starting on the twenty-fourth and resume on the twenty-eighth. Afterwards, they will change the play every week. Among the decided plays, the first week will feature "This is Only Spring," starring Xia Xiabai, Li Xuli, and the second week will feature "The Young Mistress's Fan," starring Lu Luming.</p>
<h3>New Lineups in Two Theatrical Circles</h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>The Gold and Renewal Theaters have both specially invited famous northern opera stars to perform in Shanghai at the beginning of next month. The new star at the Gold Theater is female performer Mao Shilai, and at the Renewal Theater is male performer Tan Fuying. It is said that many famous actors are coming with them this time. The reporter has obtained the details of the lineups from the two theaters, and a comprehensive announcement is made below:</p>
<p>Mao Shilai's Team</p>
<p>Mao Shilai's team is currently performing at the Guanglu Theater in Qingdao. After the performances, they will come to Shanghai and debut at the Gold Theater around the beginning of next month. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Lead Actor: Mao Shilai</p>
<p>Male Role: Chen Shaolin</p>
<p>Young Male Role: Chen Shengtai</p>
<p>Clown: Ai Shiju, Zhan Shifu, Luo Shengong</p>
<p>Painted Face: Yuan Shihai, Xu Shengkui</p>
<p>Old Male Role with Wrapped Head: Xu Xixing</p>
<p>Martial Male Role: Zhang Yunxi</p>
<p>Martial Female Role: Wang Shixiang</p>
<p>Martial Arts: Zhang Shaojie</p>
<p>The above lineup is slightly different from Shilai's previous visit to Shanghai. The male role Sha Shixin has been replaced by Chen Shaolin. (Originally, the young male role accompanying Mao to Shanghai this time was supposed to be Chi Shigong. Shigong declined the invitation from the Gold Theater because he had not graduated for long and because of Sha Shixin's previous disappointment in coming south rashly, so Shaolin was invited instead). The young male role Jiang Shiyu has also been replaced by Chen Shengtai. (It is said that this is because Shiyu's asking price was too high). Shengtai came with Xi Xiaobo this spring and received favorable reviews. He is also a graduate of Fu Liancheng, and it is expected that he will be able to cooperate happily with Shilai. The clowns Ai Shiju and Luo Shengong are both veterans from the previous team. This time, Zhan Shifu has been added, making it even better. According to reports, Shifu's clown skills were extremely popular during his time at the academy, far above Shiju's. He was Shilai's old partner during Shilai's academy days. Shifu accompanied Shilai when he first came south, but Shilai then invited Shiju to partner with him because Shifu's voice had deteriorated. This time, he is working with Shilai again, which is good news for the audience. Yuan Shihai is slated for the painted face role. However, because Shihai is currently performing with Lian Liang in Shanghai, it is still a question of whether Lian Liang will be willing to let Shihai stay in Shanghai, as the French Customs is currently very focused on painted face roles. Chen Xixing, the old male role with a wrapped head, is the senior student of Fu Liancheng and has worked with Mao Shilai's partner Gou Huisheng for a long time. He is also an expert in this field. Regarding the martial male role, the Gold Theater is in contact with Zhang Yunxi. However, Yunxi is currently performing in the Northeast and is extremely popular. It is currently difficult to determine whether he can arrive in time. If Yunxi comes, then the martial female role Wang Shixiang and Yunxi's assistant Zhang Shaojie will also come. Otherwise, the Gold Theater plans to have Wu Yanheng continue for another term.</p>
<h3>Liang Xiaoluan Enters and Pays Respects to Mei Lanfang</h3>
<p>— Gu</p>
<p>Female performer Liang Xiaoluan has given a very good impression to the opera lovers during her performance at the Renewal Theater this time. Starting today, she began to post farewell souvenirs. Yesterday, the reporter met Liang Qi (also known as Xiaoluan) at the China Hotel and asked her what new developments she planned after her performance at the Renewal Theater ended. She smiled and replied to the reporter:</p>
<p>"Although I feel that my performance in Shanghai has been satisfactory, I feel that my art is very lacking. Therefore, after leaving the Renewal Theater, I don't want to seek any new developments, but want to study hard and learn from a teacher."</p>
<p>She then said: "Recently, a Mrs. Shen told me that she intended to introduce me to Dr. Mei Lanfang, a master of the arts. If there are no unexpected obstacles, I will go to Hong Kong to pay respects to Dr. Mei after resting in Shanghai for a few days."</p>
<p>It is said that this Mrs. Shen said that she had a 120% certainty of introducing her. We only hope that there are no unexpected obstacles, so that after "Little Bird" Wang Xichun, Dr. Mei will have another outstanding disciple.</p>
<h3>Recent Records of the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Zheng Baiyong</p>
<p>Recently, it has been rumored that Xinhua will produce a large number of "folk tale" films, and at the same time start filming "Pearl Tower", "Describing Golden Phoenix", and "Jade Dragonfly". It is heard that there are some discrepancies. The above films are not Xinhua's plans, but the planned debut productions of a certain film company that is still being organized. The company is under the jurisdiction of the China United Film Company, so the registration procedures for the company have not yet been completed, and it may be temporarily commissioned by Xinhua to produce them.</p>
<p>The company, with a large amount of capital, relies on the technical personnel of Xinhua, Huaxin, and Huacheng, and a wide photography factory, preparing to produce eight or nine outstanding productions in the most agile way, such as "Wang Laohu Robbing His Bride" directed by Xu Xinwei and starring Shangguan Yunzhu, Gu Yelu, Jiang Ming, and Han Langen; "Describing Golden Phoenix" directed by Tang Jie and starring Li Hong and Zhang Wan; "Jasper Basket" directed by Bu Wancang and starring Chen Yanyan, Li Qing, and Gu Yelu, etc.</p>
<p>"Du Shiniang" is also one of the nine masterpieces planned by the company. It is now heard that there are rumors of transferring the production to Guohua.</p>
<h3>Universal Film – The Bone Cave is Filled with Terrifying Scenes, Premiering at the Grand Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Hollywood Actresses Compete to Insure Their Beauty and Health – Sonja Henie's Pair of Skating Legs are Insured for 2.6 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The June 18th Xinwen Bao Yihai published a very interesting news item, saying that Hollywood movie stars are willing to spend huge sums of money on insurance to protect their health and beauty in order to prevent accidents, because the health and beauty of their bodies are very closely related to their reputation. For example, the toe dancer Zolena in "Toes Up," her pair of jade toes, are insured for 250,000 yuan each. Actress Alice Faye's complexion is considered by color film experts to be the most suitable for filming color films without the need for powder, so her complexion is also insured for 25,000 yuan. Another actress, Annie Louise, her weight is the most moderate in Hollywood, so her "standard weight" is also insured for 75,000 yuan. Sonja Henie's total insurance coverage is 3 million yuan, of which 2.6 million yuan is for her two "skating legs". This shocking insurance fully proves how much the movie stars value and sell their health and beauty. Looking back at Chinese women, although the morbid beauty praised in ancient times, such as Xi Shi holding her heart and Daiyu's frailty, has been eliminated by the times and become a historical relic, there are still a few women who, although possessing innate beauty, often have flat chests and dull skin due to their weak bodies. Although they apply thick makeup and wear fine clothes, they cannot get rid of their sickly appearance. Seeing other people's towering breasts and high hips, looking up and striding forward, it is truly envious and ashamed.</p>
<p>The Minyi "Xin Bao Feng," produced by Minyi Pharmaceutical Factory, is the latest multiple hormone preparation specially created to suit the physique of Chinese women. It contains mammary gland hormone, which is the most potent chemical substance for promoting breast development, and is supplemented by Minyi's synthetic ovarian hormone and precious endocrine preparations such as Minyi "Placenta Zhen". It mainly treats sexual dysfunction, irregular menstruation, breast atrophy, dull skin, palpitations, insomnia, etc. It is remarkably effective and can transform leanness into health and beauty. The most obvious effect is that the flat breasts gradually become rounded. If you look in the mirror, you will definitely feel that you are no longer the same as before and smile with delight.</p>
<p>The general branches of Chinese and Western pharmacies in the city, the western medicine departments of Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, and New World department stores, Dashijie Pharmacy, Baxianqiao Guotai Xingji Pharmacy, French-Chinese Pharmacy, Huayang Pharmacy, Dalu Pharmacy, Nanyang Pharmacy, Zhengwei Pharmacy, Jicheng Pharmacy, Huaying Pharmacy, Huamei Pharmacy, British-Chinese Pharmacy, and Jihuatang Tai Pharmacy all sell it.</p>
