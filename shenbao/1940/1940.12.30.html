<h3>日本來年度的預算</h3>
<p>日本第七十六屆議會，於廿六日召集開慕之後，旋即循例宣告休會，將於一個月之後再行召開，自一八九〇年日本第一屆帝國議會成立以來，整整五十年間，怕要以本年這一屆最爲黯淡無色。但是這除却用以點綴政治季節而外，也還具有唯一重大任務，那便是來年度預算案的通過</p>
<p>本年度日本預算的普通會計部分，編製特別遲，直到本月九日才告編成，於十日提出閣議討論，只用了一小時就草草通過；計總數六十八萬六千三百餘萬元，比較今年度的五十八萬二千二百萬，多出十餘萬萬，這一數字在日本財政史上自然是空前的龐大。據日藏相河田烈的聲明。「新預算是爲了謀重點主義與節用主義之徹底，以國際情勢之推移與完全處理「中國事變」爲目標，俾充實軍備擴充生產能力，建設高度國防」，是以各省經費普遍都有增加。照這道理講，自然陸海農商及外務各省應該增加的最多，而和去年預算數字比較起來，增加最多的却是大藏省，共達三萬一千八百萬元，其次纔是海軍省的二萬一千四百萬元，而陸軍省所增的一萬萬元不過僅和遞信等省相若，這與美國龐大的擴軍預算案比較眞是貧弱得可憐！而大藏商工兩省經費雖有增加，不生產的消耗亦隨之激漲，有如大藏省主管的公債利息一項，今年支出已達九萬萬餘，明年所加恐怕比預算所增數額更大；遞信省所增加的一萬萬元據說是爲了擴充航空的需要，但由該省轉發的死亡將士年金數額年有增加，爲數較前此何止倍蓰。何况日本貨幣的購買力較前益低，軍事器材價格則逐日高漲，是以來年日本普通軍政費數　，縱較前增加，實質上限於財力而無異减少，誰相信其眞能達到充實軍備完成高度國防的目標？</p>
<p>但這僅屬日本全部預算中的普通會計部分，至於一向數額與之相埒的臨時特別軍費預算則至今未見公布，據說要等到來春纔能確定；這一情形，也是和往屆不同的地方。現在雖無從懸揣其數額，若以目前日本對華作戰形勢而論，總不會比今年的四十四萬五千元更少；雖然日閥正在佔領地區竭力搜括，所得終屬有限。此外如再益以準備南進的必要支出，為數當更不止此。其遲遲未見釐定，大概因為南進一舉目前尚在舉棋不定之際，既不願外間從特別軍費的預算窺測其此後動向，又不願以過分龐大的數字刺激內外視聽。據一般揣測，無論如何，此項數額必較本年度更高。此地姑且退一步，假定其仍以今年水準爲度，那與普通預算部分合計已達一百十三萬萬元以上；這數目較之並世列强，如在戰爭中的英德，守中立的蘇美，固均遠有未逮，比之二十年前的日本，却增加到十倍—那時正是日本帝國主義繁榮的項點，現在却正臨到貧困的極度。以是這一預算之如何實施便成爲日當局未來的絕大難題。</p>
<p>根據日方統計，去年日本國民總收入不過二百六十萬萬元，即使來年不再减少，那一預算總額已達其百分之四十五，這是任何國家所罕見的現象。何况日本生產事業與對外貿易都在急劇萎縮中，此後日本擴展之念愈亟，國際形勢必愈惡劣，國民收入必形銳减，負擔能力亦當愈爲削弱。再就預算表上所列政府歲收項下來看，也不過僅有四十二萬萬元，比較普通預算部分已不敷二十萬萬餘元，那已規定以增發公債來抵補；而臨時軍費部分的四十四萬五千萬元（假定其仍僅此數），却完全沒有着落。據日方報紙推測：恐怕不得不增加捐稅。事實上，到十一月底爲止，日本國債已累積到二百六十九萬萬餘元，而今昨兩年所增發的七十餘萬萬之中，還有十幾萬萬不曾消化，所謂「公債亡國」的預言，今已略見朕兆。明年度已規定再增發二十萬萬，如果特別軍費項下要全靠公債抵補，自然絕少可能，而增稅一途也未可樂觀。今年銳意增加稅收，所得不過二十五萬萬餘，平均每一日人要分配到三十五元之巨，際此不景氣現象日益增進，再加重人民負擔已不可能。除去公債增稅以外，所餘出路只有增發紙幣和吸收民間存款。但日本紙幣發行總額在今年九月以前總在三十三萬萬元左右，到十一月底已激增到三十七萬五千萬元，通貨膨脹現象的表面化已無可避免，如再增發，勢必再刺激物價上昇，使人民生活愈益困苦。至於存款問題，日政府所最仰仗的郵政儲金，已隨着經濟一般衰落而日見萎縮，銀行存款亦形减低，像去年年尾日政府所標榜的百萬萬儲金募集計畫，到來年也絕難適用。以是近衛內閣近雖積極向着法西斯化方面推進藉以加强政府統制，但是民力耗竭，即使竭澤而漁也未必能應付那一空前預算的需要。</p>
<p>日本預算照例必須交由國會通過，但議會却沒有否決預算的能力，何况際此憲政體制名存實亡，即有照例的質問以資點綴，也斷無效果可言。是以到明年議會重開之後，預算案之全盤通過是沒有問題的；但無論日當局採用何等方法去實施此一預算，其唯一結果却只有更加深日本內外的困難以至於崩潰。</p>

<h3>中日貨幣戰之今後　原題：關於「第三種紙」</h3>
<p>— 古聊齋</p>
<p>聖誕之夜，伯和翁親友爲翁稱觴祝嘏；下賤驅車走賀，晤西疁，健翔，慶石，紹裘，包容，秋葦，安倫諸君子。故朋新交，歡然一席。觥籌交錯之間，不乏亂世佳話，談古說今，語及江寗「儲備銀行券」，各方談鋒集中。西疁詼諧，稱之爲「第三種紙」。歸而憶所聞，猶歷歷在耳際；亟爲追紀，已不及半；雖不足與本刊前所舉行之各次座談會媲美，然亦足饒茶餘飯後之談助者。</p>
<p>新娘與女嬪相</p>
<p>西疁……「聯鈔」是「第一種紙」，「華與」是「第二種紙」，所以現在發賞預約的江寗新出品，該是「第三種紙」，……（衆笑）。可是一代不如一代！……（衆笑）</p>
<p>秋葦　可把軍用票忘了。</p>
<p>西疁　性質上雖是一樣，形式上可不同。</p>
<p>包容　日本一向反對，因為他將影響軍用票。軍用票是日本發軍餉，收買中國土產的唯一財源。現在怎麽攪起來了？</p>
<p>紹裘　四種都不中用，誰都不够資格影響誰！日本軍人的否可，不過以此的束江寗；華北則以此排擠江寗而維繫「聯銀」；「華興」部隊旣得新組織裏的權位，則無所謂。眞正反對新計劃的那是日本的商人和較有目光的知識份子，霞關的外交界人物，也不表同情。日本財閥更不贊成。其實不論誰反對，誰贊成；誰都沒有一個確實辦法。事情糟就糟在法幣的力量太大了，日本却窮得一籌莫展。要取得中國土產，攫取華人富力，便有利用法幣的必要。他們搜集法幣的機會與可能雖不小，畢竟有限度；有限的收入不够無窮的需要，所以又常想製造一種可以給他無限榨取的工具。「聯鈔」「華興券」軍用票，已屢試屢敗。雖在淪陷區裏的市塲上也不能通用。如脅於淫威而收用時，則都把物價抬高；，故其價値，實際尙在法幣之下。而且非有暴力背景的人，那就非用法幣支付不可。日本商人爲了要保證其收買到的原料，比較標準些，方便些，也寗使先籌一筆法幣，再去交易，很可笑的，他們急於收買原料時，輒以法幣支付當廣吿，去誘惑掮客，拉攏賣方。戲法變得越多，淪陷區裏的物價越貴。於是日商的困難也越大。日商成本大，影響波及日本國內的物價。日本物價政策一籌莫展，商工省常遭各方斥爲庸碌無能。商工省明知軍部所行非是，但軍部以「開拓物資來源」自尊。然而中國土產搬到日本去，都經過日商之手。因之商工省以至大藏省均不得不稍稍顧全在華日商的利益。要保證在華日商的利益，沒有別法，就是承認用日元作價的物價，不能與軍用票或法幣等計價的相差太遠。吾則，在華日商太吃虧，運貨回日的興趣也要大减。日本商工省無法割斷中國淪陷區與日本國內的物價的因果關係。近幾個月來，他們想盡方法提高軍用票的價格，使在華日商得以軍票去收貨，略略减輕他們的成本，並使他們運貨回日時不致太吃虧。但提高軍票價格的效果，只能在被控制的幾條鐵路和公路的售票窗口裏的櫃臺罷了，一到商品市塲，依然黯澹無色。所以他們現在異想天開，一反阻撓新「中央銀行」的計劃，而予以許可。然而他們的目的，適和×××相反。有意把「第三種紙」當做一種「犧牲品」。</p>
<p>秋葦　日本想抬高軍用票的價格，想盡了許多方法。甚至考慮到如何减少發行，而使軍用票專爲發軍餉，專供在華日軍購買物資，而减少其他方面的用途。所以在今年九月裏，曾經揭示過七種辦法。即（一）在華新設企業的不核准；（二）在華建築土木工程時，必先經過申請。（三）限制日人來華；（四）限制匯款來華。（五）加强淪陷區與後方的貿易控制；（六）各種營利事業，一律實施許可制度。（七）抬高運貨回日的貨價等等。但結果只能表現出在華日商和在日日商利害對立的尖銳化。這些辦法的眞正作用，只在維持在華日商優先來華的利益，防止繼續來華活動者的競爭。今年九月後軍用票價値一時高漲，據說是日軍授意某日商銀行實行大規模投機活動的結果。他在七十七元左右時大量買進，一般投機商便大量拋空；到期便發生軋空局面，才發覺受了哄論，從此洗手不做。故當該日商銀行想乘高傾吐時，已無買手，乃造成今日有行無市的局面。因爲這種投機，比別種投機更危險。買進容易，賣出却就沒有對手。至於禍國殃民，更不消說起！</p>
<p>健翔　兪敎授，你說日本有意把「第三種紙」當做「犧牲品」火車汽車等賣票窗口裏的櫃臺上才能抬高，一離開窗口就不能和法幣競爭。因此他要製造一個命定失敗的「競爭者」，使軍票的價格在淪陷區的市塲上，也能對另一種「貨幣」硬幾張豆腐皮，於是×××的計劃，便是理想中的「犧牲品」了。而且依照他們的如意算盤，「第三種紙」和法幣等價聯繫的，那末「第三種紙」的犧牲，也該把法幣同時犧牲了。但幽靈一般的「華興券」，發行之初也是和法幣作爲「等價聯繫」的；法幣還是法幣，「華興劵」終逃不出幽靈的命運而夭折。「第三種紙」的命運，也不外乎此。</p>
<p>西疁　女嬪相應該找個不及新娘的才行，吾則相形見拙，豈不丢臉？新娘其貌不揚時，更非用此政策不可！……（衆笑）</p>
<p>「第三種紙」的難產與前途</p>
<p>慶石　江寗組織每個月的經費，已由一千萬增到一千六百萬，這是物價高漲的必然結果。可是所謂收入，每月不過五六百萬至一千萬，每個月要短少七八百萬。幾决要求日方把發行貨物搬出證等財源，分些給他們；但分到的實在太小。綁架之類的收入，進私囊者多；發搬出證也只便宜少數人，而且非親不眷者莫想買到。不生果子的果園裏猴子不想去的。發不兌換紙幣畢竟比製造臘像菓品來得容易。但臘像菓品還可充裝飾品；當然他對於淪陷區的人民，可以强迫行使。然而發不兌換紙幣是十足的畫餅充飢。所以在所謂「整理貨幣暫行辦法」裏雖規定了「政府機關」的各項經費支付，都用「第三種紙」，却又補一句「在特定區域內暫不適用」。這就是他們自己都不要的明證。所以我敢斷言：將來流出的必等於流進的全部。正像今日的軍用票一樣，發行額的全部，幾盡在日商銀行的賬面上。日人正自鳴得意，認爲這是軍票政策的成功，以爲變成「儲藏通貨」了。豈知這正是他們數倍於此的日本貨，銷在中國淪陷區裹所得的代價。母怪日商和華人，同樣在叫苦連天。</p>
<p>秋葦　別說商叫苦，就是日木政府也叫苦連天。在華日軍以軍用票發軍餉，强購淪陷區裏的貨物。淪陷區裏商人一接到軍用票，就盡量想方法變成貨物。淪陷區裹的市塲，旣已變成日本貨市塲。於是傾銷日本貨的結果，便收進了軍部所發的這筆軍用票。假使日貨不源源銷華，軍用票便沒有出路；軍用票價格必一蹶不振。然而日本國內正苦物資恐慌，正苦外匯恐慌；為了要獲得外匯，才到中國來傾銷。結果反吃了自己的倒賬，眞是啼笑皆非。所以日本商人目擊「聯鈔」「華興券」等等失收，同時又發現法幣價値的偉大，所以一向就主張利用法幣，維持法幣，發行軍用票時，他們就反對。「第三種」「第叫種」，他們實在更討厭。×××爲「第三種行」已不知絞了多少腦汗，奔上不少次腿，老是以熱氣去換冷氣；這也是主因之一。</p>
<p>紹裘　是的！是的！日本國內的物資恐慌，現已達於頂點。一面感到對華輸出的不實惠，一面又碰到海外各國的市塲拒絕日貨；所以他始終做着一個夢，夢到終有一天會想出一條計策，用很少物資，甚至無需要物資，而得充分攫取中國的土產。提高軍用票價格，也許就是他們目前計劃的一種手段。但是閘北火車站的賣票窗口上的市塲實在太少了；今年九十月裏奉命進行多頭投機的那爿日商銀行，至今還在有行無市的市塲上團團轉，無法脫手。想另製一種犧牲品來替代軍用票的命運，結果必使軍用票的流通地域更狹隘，因爲軍用票可以流去的地方，第三種紙大槪也能流去。軍用票不能流去的地方，第三種紙當然更無希望流去。所以雖則誰都不够資格影響誰，但是自相擠總免不了的。這也是熱氣換冷氣的另一個因。現在，×××非特對軍用票讓步，甚至對「聯鈔」也讓步，不復妄圖獨佔淪陷區裏的發行權，才換到一聲「是」。然而華北早指定爲「聯鈔區域」，華中華南早指定爲軍用票區域。「聯鈔」在華北，至今仍不能和法幣競爭；只因華北日軍自己並不另發一種紙幣，所以凡日軍駐在的點綫，才得强制流通。至於華中華南，日本軍用票旣不肯放棄其旣得地盤，而且牠的地盤，實在也小得可憐；換句話說：除了鐵道和公路的沿綫幾個主要站頭的賣買房裏，才能活動活動；此外就不能插足。「華興券」的失敗，就因爲沒有地盤。這「第二種紙」的命運，實更逃不出這個命運。過去，「華興」方面也數度要求軍部給牠一些地盤，日本軍部以極大慷慨，允許海關裏可以收取「華興券」。然而華人仍法幣繳納，而「維新」方面則正恐商人以「華與券」完稅而影響他們的「財政」，故亦歡迎法幣。不過納稅時先依「華興券」市價折成關金單位，目的在實行變相加稅。「第三種紙」的命運，充其極，至多只能繼承「華興券」的這筆遺產罷了！</p>
<p>外匯前途及其對策</p>
<p>西疁　劉敎授，你獨個兒吃菜，可不行，我要請敎你，外匯將怎樣？</p>
<p>安倫　給投機朋友製造一個機會而已。</p>
<p>健翔　聖誕前兩大，影響可不小。烚赤很快的從五千六七百元，激漲到六千六七百元；美匯從五元八角多，一下子就縮到五元三角模樣。各物均開始漲價，大家都很慌張。</p>
<p>安倫　大家慌張的，不在「第三種紙」會作出什麽大怪；擔心的倒是國府的反攻戰略。匯豐掛低牌價，人心所以更吃驚。其實國府的反攻，不論其所採何種戰略，加强法幣的地位爲目的。市塲中人原都曉得。法幣決無問題，他們也知道。眞是矛盾！</p>
<p>健翔</p>
<p>他們都是混水裏撈魚，毫不矛盾。</p>
<p>安倫　放走了魚，再去捉，還不矛盾嗎？放時容易捉時難；最近幾個月外匯節節放長；美僑撤退，太平洋戰機日促，外匯多頭誰不魂飛魄散？爲什麽投機商人會這樣健忘？目前國際形勢比前更緊張，外匯用途比前更狹隘，而美英蘇三國的新借款成立後，法幣的基礎更來得結實。他們似乎都把這些鐵一般的事實都遺忘了！</p>
<p>西疁　不錯，誰敢擔保太平洋的太平還能維持幾天？到那時外匯只能好像郵票一樣供人欣賞欣賞罷了。上海的命運也朝不保夕，囤了貨，可沒有一間保險公司會承保不被沒收的險。</p>
<p>健翔　那怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>紹裘　你着急什麼？（衆笑）這種東西，値不得理睬；就是要理睬，我相信國家早已有所準備。而且美英蘇決不是呆漢，借款給中國時，決不會不想到被人套買。</p>
<p>健翔　大家擔心的，就是政府再度放棄維持上海的外匯市塲。如果供給一停止，匯價勢必再縮</p>
<p>西疁　於是外匯縮了，物價漲了，豈不是庸人自擾？</p>
<p>健翔　不停止供給外匯，就無法防止別人套買。如果要减少別人套買外匯的可能，便只有放任匯價再下降。投機家本無所謂心肝不心肝。只要有錢可賺，犧牲國家利益也在所不問。就是做生意人，預測匯價將縮，物價將漲，也要未雨綢繆；這也不能說他是庸人自擾。</p>
<p>西疁　套買外匯，須要準備大量法幣；他根本無法流通，能得多少法幣？</p>
<p>健翔　如果他來套買，有會麼辦法？</p>
<p>安倫　倒底怎麽辦？我們果然不得而知；而且也未便妄加推測。不過事實上，儘有種種辦法可以應付。姑不談其他，只舉一個例來說：那就是紐的市塲上的英鎊黑市塲，爲什麼可以消滅？只要取得國際匯兌市塲上有力量者問的合作，那末儘可以一面防止外匯資源的消耗，另一面仍使匯市穩定不動。</p>
<p>上海的外匯黑市塲，木產生於中國實施匯兌統制政策之後。因爲當時不獲英美銀行等的合作，非特得不到他們的合作，他們還公開宣佈停止過去所締結的紳士協定。假使當時英美等銀行和中國的匯兌政策合作，那末黑市塲決不會產生；就是有，也決不會縮成今日這般地步。</p>
<p>健翔　現在能不能合作？</p>
<p>安倫　國家怎樣對付「第三種紙」誰都不能預料。這不過是我個人的猜想。以今昔的國際情形比較一下，我覺得要取得這種合作，很有可能。</p>
<p>在中國實施法幣制度時，誰都知道，和英鎊聯繫的。所以美元和法幣，只是匯兌上的對手，不是匯兌上的同伴。當中國實施匯兌統制時，英國在張伯倫的綏靖政策之下，不願以對葉的貨幣同盟去束縛他外交上的自由；就是成立中英平準基余後，也僅以穩定公開匯市爲原期，對於統制政策並未作積極的援助。不積極强化匯兌統制，不積極取締匯兌投機，僅僅從穩定公開匯市上着手，結果當然無法防制套匯一，如要减少套匯，便只有苦肉計，放任匯價下降。如果加强匯兌統制，那末毋需維持匯市，匯市也不會稍動。無區別的穩定匯市，實在是一個不很健全的辦法。但中國的匯兌統制，如不獲友邦的合作，那末在國際關係複雜的上海，尤其在準淪陷區域一般的上海，可以說是不可能的。</p>
<p>現在國際上的情勢，比不得過去英美對遠東的態度，較前已進步多多。他們已充分明瞭中國的勝利和英美在遠東的權益，有不可分割性。英美過去對於中國的貨幣政策，不免有所競爭。道也是中國實施匯兌時未能取得國際合一你的理由之一。中美間各方面都合作，在遠東的利害關係更其一致。比較不合作的在過去祇是貨幣政策方面。因爲中國的法幣政策，與美國實施白銀運動的目的並不一致。美國雖未予法幣政策以積極的合作，但仍予以友誼上的援助，如簽訂中美白銀協定等等便是明證。然中美間的貨幣關係，截止此决美國以一萬萬元貸款中國之前，仍未進入同盟時期，而僅逗留於友誼上的援助而已。可是此决借款，却空前的宣稱用以援助中國的法幣。這是前所未有的事。可見中美間唯一沒有走上合作階段的貨幣關係，現在亦已奠下了同盟的基礎。那末中國需要强化匯兌統制時，問題就簡單得多。</p>
<p>外匯供給加以管理之後，正當商業需要充分供給，投機活動與套買企圖，即無所施其伎倆。那時，法幣在上海的黑市場，便像英鎊在紐約的黑市塲，一樣可以很迅速的消滅；而匯價必然的從此更穩定於適當的水準。</p>
<p>「第三種紙」有何攻勢</p>
<p>健翔　不過在上海總有些危險。江寗方面會不會抄襲「聯鈔」的强制收換政策，來一步步的奪取各人手裏的法幣？</p>
<p>安倫　當然有這可能，但有這可能時，豈僅各人手裏的法幣，就是你們囤着的貨物，黄金，外匯，乃至生命等等，無一沒有被沒收的可能。但這是隨上海的命運而定。可是他有什麽力量決定上海的命運呢？</p>
<p>紹裘　上海的富源在於商業。破壞上海的安全，道是殺鷄求卵的笨勁。</p>
<p>秋葦　第三種紙，和其他一樣，果以破壞法幣爲最後目的。但法幣不會感受絲毫損害。江寗的人也明知其然；所以牠的發行，仍抄襲失敗的「華興券」之與法幣「等價聯繫」的老辦法。中國如要對付，將有今昔之分。過去以苦肉計打敗「華興」，因爲那時外匯水準尙高；現在呢，則不必如此。劉敎授的觀察，我想很有可能。</p>
<p>健翔　「第三種紙」會不會鑽進上海租界區裏？</p>
<p>紹裘　「華興券」和軍用票，都鑽進來過嗎？在市塲上你看見過嗎？牠的用途只有去買火車票。此外連一包火柴都買不動；有國家觀念的自然不會收受；沒有國家觀念的，因爲特愛財如命，所以同樣不會收受。假使你身畔有這種票紙，你有臉出以示人嗎？總之，他旣不能破壞法幣，反阻碍他榨取社會富力的可能；至於救濟他們自己的財荒，也不過是畫餅充餓。如攷慮到實惠時，那末他也許叉會發現一動不如一靜罷？</p>

<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>——十二月二十八日——</p>
<p>中國的契稅</p>
<p>本月十八日國民政府公佈契稅暫行條例十七條，卽於公佈日施行，規定在未來土地法舉辦土地稅區域，凡屬不動產的典或賣，受讓人應行領用契紙完納契稅。牠的內容如下：</p>
<p>契紙內容：分存根繳查本契三聊號，騎縫處各編字號；內載明土地種類，四至地落·面積，房屋間數·賣典價·訂的日期·契的當事人·中證人姓名·其他必要事項。</p>
<p>契紙式樣：由財政部製定。</p>
<p>契紙　費：每張國幣五角。</p>
<p>契稅稅率：（一）賣契爲賣價的五％，（二）且契爲典價的三％。先典後賣的賣契得以原納契稅額劃抵賣契稅，但以典權人買主同屬一人且同一姓名爲限。</p>
<p>納稅期間：受讓人應於契約成立後四個月內完納契稅。</p>
<p>各項罰則：（一）逾期納稅的罰則：契的成立後四個月尙不稅的，除責令補稅外，並科以應納稅額白分之十的罰金，每再逾期二個月遞加百分之十，至達應納稅額的全數爲止。但在規定納稅期間，因不可抗力致不能如期完納契稅的，得聲明事由，經查明屬實，免予處罰。</p>
<p>（二）匿報契價的罰則：匿報賣價或典價的，除責令另換契紙，據實改正補繳應納稅額外，凡匿報二〇％以下的賣出價，罰短納稅額的半數，在二〇％以上至五〇％以下的，罰短納稅額的全數，在〇%以上的，罰短納稅額的二倍。</p>
<p>（三）不用契紙的罰則：不　依法領用契紙的，除責令繳　價補領外，科以一元以上五元以下的罰金。</p>
<p>契稅是土地房屋等不動產產權有買賣侈轉時，所立憑證，須呈騐登記，所有權方得以確定保陣，因以繳納的一種賦稅。契稅在不動產移轉時始有收入，故是臨時的機會稅收，在財政學上的稱類是流通稅中登記稅的一種。</p>
<p>中國契稅發達得很早，在淸順治叫年（西一六四七）即規定凡買賣田地房屋照價銀每兩徵稅三分。　熙十六年（西一六七七）至二十一年間先後增定江·浙·魯·贛等省契稅。雍正七年（西下七二九）准契稅每兩三分之外，加微一分作爲科塲經費。以後演變情形待考。至民國三年財政部曾頒布契稅條例，及契稅條例施行細則，又有柿訂契稅條例施行細則。民國四年，財政部核准發行契紙細則。五年公布特別區契稅規則。這些法規出今爲各省所沿用。雖然各省中有自訂契稅規程的，原則上大體相同。據條例的規定，凡不動產的買主或承典人，須於契的成立後六倘月以內，持赴該管徵稅官署，呈騐註冊。契紙川各縣政府發行，或將契約文字寫於官賣契紙上，或貼於官契之上。契紙取費則自每張數至或一二兀。在呈騐時，須納契稅，賣契稅是契價的白分之九，典契稅是契價的白分之六。先典後賣的契稅得以原納　契稅額劃抵買契稅，但以承典人與買主同屬於一人時爲限。</p>
<p>此决所公布的契稅暫行條例內容和過去的雖無大異，但就前述的一加比較則在稅率方面契紙方面納稅方面略有不同。就稅率說賣契稅由百分之九减爲白分之五，典契稅由百分之六减爲百分之三。就契紙說，則取費規定爲五角。就納稅期間說則山六個月內减爲四個月。徵收的稅率雖然减低，徵收的技術則已加嚴。蓋稅率過重易使逃稅及匿報由賣價以减少納稅額，現在稅率旣輕，並對逃稅及匿報加以重罰，自易使受讓人樂於納稅，以早日確定所有權得以保障。</p>
<p>契稅的收入，原由各縣徵收彙解中央。但在北京政府時代各省常有截留。所以民國二年財政部曾訂有「國家稅與地方稅草案」，將契稅劃歸中央，以事實困難，從未實行。國民政府成立之後，對於租稅制度銳意整頓，在十匕年十一月頒布劃分國地收入標準」，本中央地方均權的精神，及因契稅與田賦有關，改歸各省政府，爲省政府的主要收入。以後於民國二十年十一月公布「辦理預算收支分類標準」對於契稅仍歸定爲地方稅。二十四年年七月公布的「財政收支系統法」中規定爲縣或隸屬於省之市的稅，惟不稱之爲契稅，而名之爲房產稅，規定在土地法施行後倂入土地改良物稅。目今財政收支系統法雖經國府明令在非常時期暫緩實施，但此决公佈的契稅暫行條例，仍貫澈這種辦法，規定契稅山縣市政府徵收之。</p>

<h3>明日國歷年終結帳　金融狀態安定投機范圍狹隘銀根寬裕　銀錢各業準四日開紅盤</h3>
<p>明日爲民國二十九年年終、銀錢兩業辦理總結賬、各銀行對儲蓄商業各部結息、均已辦竣、各錢莊已趕辦年度結算、準元旦起一律休假三天、四日起開市營業、上海整個金融、依然穩定如恒、錢業拆息低落、足證銀根寬裕、各業均安謐渡過、並於本屆余融狀態、與上屆比、似較安定、其顯著者如下、</p>
<p>游資流回</p>
<p>自戰事延長之後、資金外流、勢所難免、然自今年五月歐戰擴大後、歐洲交戰國家貨幣之狀態一變、三國軸心公的公佈、美國積極整軍、太平洋局勢漸呈動盪不安之象、昔日流往香港及南洋之資金、大量流入本埠、銀根大鬆、匯劃帖水降低至二元以下、幾將消滅、</p>
<p>利率降低</p>
<p>銀根鬆弛、利率自然低减、本屆中各商業銀行相率減去活存利率一厘、上海銀錢業之聯合準備會庫、對各會員行莊一致减低利息、自各商業銀行相繼减息之後、而存戶並無大宗提存之舉、市面呈鬆中帶穩之象、中中交農四國家銀行、則並未减低利息、</p>
<p>公債上漲</p>
<p>財政部聲明決心維持債信之後、民國二十五年統一各債陸續上漲、疊見八一三後之新高價、不獨內債高漲、而外債亦然、倫敦行市、中國各種外債、每决均上升一鎊半至五鎊之譜、例如善後公債、十月內曾低至十八鎊、今升至三十四鎊、至於內債之本息、按期撥出、專款償付、從未愆期、</p>
<p>外匯基金</p>
<p>自美貸華一萬萬美元吿成、其中五千萬美元、作為中美金融合作穩定法幣之用、繼之又有英國一千萬鎊之借款、憶自五二風潮後、英政府即稱須美國合作、以維持中國法幣、今則可實現、外匯基礎已奠、法幣信仰益堅、惟運用方式之規定、尙待兩國間之商訂耳、</p>
<p>投機戒懼</p>
<p>上海金融商品市場、因中國政府一時權利不及、以致投機活動無從禁止、然今與昔較、其範圍已見狹隘、由於國際關係之變遷、外幣外商股票、自五二風潮後、經營者亦具戒心、外匯黑市、經外匯平準基金管理委員會維持、已告穩定、各市塲之投機者、比較上屆爲安靜、</p>
<h3>三國合作紡織套匯　應付極為充裕宋子文氏與英美當局　商討支持匯市順利進行</h3>
<p>關於穩定法幣匯價、防止套匯、中英美三方在技術上將採取合作辦法、此項消息、曾由本埠英僑經濟界透露、與日昨倫敦電訊、所傳中國銀行董事長宋子文、英外决費利溥斯、及美國當局、在華盛頓討論共同支持匯率辦法、極爲順利、相互印證、中英美三國在金融技術上合作、維持共同利益、已無疑義、據向銀行界探悉、上海方面英美系銀行勢力根深蒂固、而上海又爲華中經濟之中心、中國在上海得英美當局之協力、更有大量之匯兌基金、對未經核准鈔劵之發行而引起之局勢、必能應付裕如、最近黑市匯率已逐漸回鬆、新正以後、不難維持原狀、</p>
<h3>合作協會竭力推行　小額購米昨日成立推定職員　明春將到大量洋米</h3>
<p>上海食糧合作協會、推行小額集團購米、經一月餘之籌備、業已全部就緒、並於日前正式成立、開始採購、該會於日於日昨日舉行成立大會、推定監事十人、計奚玉書·蕢延芳·胡銘山·陳璉璋·孫瑞璜·楊伯庚·袁鶴松·李祖萊·王煥章·丁雪農·崔福莊·理事十五人、計裴雲卿·陳泮君·嚴諤聲·殷子白·徐致一·張文魁·陳已生·金芝軒·錢齊靈·張菊生·陸修淵·呂鐵英·艾中全·胡宣同·董國淸、負責綜理其事、所有各項已修正之代購米糧章程、日内即可正式發表、</p>
<p>發起動機</p>
<p>該會某負責人稱、民食長此以往、前途將愈趨嚴重、吾人等不忍坐視、爰不辭艱勞、發起籌組本會、決將全力推行小額集團購米、對於購米一包至五包之小額定戶、可加以優待、本會擬向社會熱心人士籌集巨額現款、將該項現款代爲墊付、故在定購時、可减半收款、俟米糧抵埠、則須全數付足、今已委託銀錢業聯誼會、及益友社等、代爲辦理、總之、本會發起動機、全係義務服務社會、及穩定民食爲宗旨、</p>
<p>明春到米</p>
<p>昨據本市米業界消息、挪威「商人號」延期至今日上午八時抵埠、船泊浦東鴻興碼頭、該輪裝有西貢洋米五萬包、該項貢米、大都爲二號米糧、聞係合義等洋行所訂購、故米市塲現貨籌碼勢必增多、市况將愈趨安定、又據另一方面透露消息、開年一月十五日左右、可有十五萬包貢米抵埠、並有大批仰光洋米、業於日昨山仰光產地裝輪、约達二十萬包、可於一月底或二月初運抵上海、故開年米價、勢必猛烈下降、</p>
<p>韓政平談</p>
<p>本市米價日益高漲限價全被衛越、當局難以戢止、平民生活愈艱、據韓政平氏談、滬市原係工商區域、全市糧食、向賴外埠輸入、遝轉原極便利、四郊受制、外匯日縮、致被囤積者壟斷、幸當局急起直追、搶米之風、得米滋蔓、詎因外匯猛縮、與金價在漲、米市竟發生暗中貼價秘密成交舉動、而衝越限價、殊堪遺恨、查本市存米、實際並未缺乏、據江海關報吿、本年進口洋米已達三百六十萬担、除過去十一個月已消耗者外、現尙有存米的一百三十萬包、尙僅就洋米一宗本年已逾入之數額而言、故本市米商、若咸能安分母貪、則暗盤漲風、不戢自平矣、</p>

<h3>日積極競選工董　英美未可漠視根據地皮章程英美不落人後　日圖改革選舉制度爭取勝利</h3>
<p>工部局下屆局董選舉、爲期雖尙有三月有奇、但日方鑒於本屆競選之失敗、處心積慮、積極爲下屆競選之準備、以日本屆留民團體爲主體、對於兢選有利之計劃、莫不着着進行、及時向英美聯會陣棧作反攻性質之競選、平明社記者特以此問題、分向工部局各關係方面探詢時、對於下屆局董競選、均未作樂觀表示、並有稱下屆競選結果、究竟誰勝誰負、一時殊難逆料、</p>
<p>日方企圖　變更選制</p>
<p>工部局所組之局董選舉委員會、係由英·美·德·俄·日等各國外籍納稅人委員所組成、其主旨完全爲謀局董選舉之手續問題、係工部局小組委員會之一、先後已舉行會議六决、最近一决、爲上星期二、日籍委員於此會中、竞提出一重要議案、企圖推翻現行選舉制、而作澈底改革、以人數多少爲局董之增减、委員會以無權變更洋涇洪地皮章程、以致無法解決、陷於僵持狀態中、該會原定於第六决會議後實行結束者、現不得不再延長其日期矣、</p>
<p>英美資產　為數鉅大</p>
<p>至於英美陣線興日方下屆選舉票數、雙方現均開始作爭取選票之步驟與方法、日方爲謀票額之增多、正將其某一納稅日僑之擁有鉅款房地產者、或負有過多納稅義務者、分給於共他無納稅義務之非眞實納稅日僑、並正竭其全力、增多日僑選票、至於英美僑民、在公共租界所擁有房地產、固遠過於日方、而其所納於工部局之捐稅、亦較多於日僑、根據地皮章程、英美下屆選舉、似不致失望、但自歐戰以來、大批美僑、已奉召離滬返國、兼之美僑以微退關係、殊使英美僑民之選票、不得不略受影響，</p>

<h3>小菜場上</h3>
<p>— 林火</p>
<p>早晨——在你們或許是很早的，當老爺們的房裏娘姨小心地推開了臥室的房門，輕輕的走了進來　　索索的把一塊塊的煤加到火爐裹去，在紅木桌上的「五更鷄」裹，瀉出一壺參湯，端近了老爺的床邊老爺半倚了身，姨太太替你把衣服披上，喝完了參湯再伴着姨太太睡上那末一小時或是二小時的覺。或者是年靑的少奶奶們，在被窩裏囑咐着恭立在房門外的老娘姨，買些什麼美味給睡在你們旁邊的少爺吃吃。那當兒，也就是我們弄堂小學的小學生子們上完了第一課興高采烈地在天井裹玩着捉迷藏，工三廠裏的工人們已做了二個多鐘頭的工作的時候，我想請求老爺小姐，少奶奶姨太太們賞一個臉，且慢睡下去，而穿起絲棉的衣服，披起長毛的大衣來，由我領你們，在那樣早的淸晨那樣寒冷的淸晨走上短短的一段路。這一條路上，我保證沒有綁票，因爲綁票決不會想到老爺們會到這一條路上來。不過地上很濕，所以不要忘記穿了皮鞋，再帶一方洒了香水精的手帕。</p>
<p>從你們生着火爐的房間裏出來，外面的確是很冷的。走完了冷靜的大弄，再轉幾個灣，巳是不十分整齊的「里坊」住宅區了。你們的汽車或許曾在這兒馳過，但那飛快的速率有時間讓你們細細地觀察那些房子裏的凌亂的佈置。照着我手指着的方向看，那家二層樓的窗口掛着一隻「小菜橱」，像要掉下來碰着行人的頭。那面有一輛糞車停着，洗馬桶的聲音不大好聽，臭味也難當，快快拿出醮過香水的手帕來。轉灣角上是一個油炸粉糰的攤頭，隔壁是粢飯攤，再隔壁是油豆腐綫粉攤，以後下去，全是緊接着的攤頭。到這裏十字路口，站着幾個像替你們看房子一樣的巡捕，拿着很粗的籐鞭。</p>
<p>這裏已經是小菜塲了，聲音很大罷！老爺們聽慣了戲院裏的鑼鼓聲，舞塲裏的「蓬折」聲，對於這，雖然一樣是大的聲音，大概不大舒服。那面陸稿薦門口，掛着雪白的肉，老爺們一定要奇怪那些一隻手拿着小菜籃的人們，爲什麽祗在門口望望而不能跑進去買肉。</p>
<p>攤頭是各式各樣全有的，擺攤的有七八十歲的老頭子和五六歲的小姑娘。許多人擁在一起，連一個蘿葡或是一小把荳芽也在爭奪。</p>
<p>買亮晶晶的帶魚的人張高了嗓子互喊，喊攏，大堆人，大家都羨慕地在翻帶魚，可是很少有幾個會講定了價錢買的僱客，多數人是眼睛睜睜在人羣中退出來了。</p>
<p>老爺們說那些東西真不衛生生，全用手撈的，不像家裹的大菜師你那樣清潔，一切全用刀叉。我告訴你們，假使彼此吃不下東西且莫怪我，老爺們一吃的東西就是這樣買去的。</p>
<p>對於那些十歲左右的擺攤者，老爺們表示很同情，可是，且慢那邊一個擺大菜攤的小姑娘被巡捕在毒打呢！大槪總是沒有捐照會。本來他們除了替老爺們必要時盡盡保護之職，及向各里弄抄抄號頭之外，最最出色的傑作還是在小菜塲上。看見了一個沒有照會的攤頭，就拉起皮鞋脚，一脚將籃筐中的菜或豆芽踢翻，踢翻之後還要狠狠地踏上幾脚，再把那空籃空籮連同那跪在旁邊連連叩頭的擺攤者一同送上了車子，罰上三元五元的錢。</p>
<p>老爺們總算肯賞臉，其實小菜塲還沒有走完。不過也罷了，外面風大得很呢！</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>不妨試試</h3>
<p>— 荊樹森</p>
<p>讀了秋郎先生的「兩粥一飯的商榷」後，覺得這一個辦法，倒是一般掙扎在孤島上的薪水階級們的福音。因為這種辦法，很容易實行。對於營養方面，旣沒有影饗；對於支出方面，又可以節省不少的消費。一舉兩得，何樂而不爲呢？</p>
<p>並不是作者故甚其詞的聳人聽聞，因爲作者自己家裏向來行的「兩粥一飯」制度；並且行了好多年代，也可以說它是「祖傳」的吧？</p>
<p>當然，在太平時候，無所謂；但是落在像現在這種年頭，可沾了它的光啦！不光是節省了食米和菜饌，而且還節省了薪炭與人工。現在就把作者的經騐寫在下面：</p>
<p>先從早餐吃粥說起，這裏所說的粥，並不是「米燒粥」，而是「飯泡粥」。所以，不是一定需要的話，早上的煤爐，照例是不生的。只把隔夜的餘飯加些開水一泡，放在火油爐上稍微燉上幾分鐘就可充飢。</p>
<p>中午這一餐，是三餐中最重要的一餐；下飯的菜饌，自然要好一些。雞魚肉，當然難得進門；靑菜豆腐，却是我們唯一的恩物。但是，「節省」的關鍵並不在這一點，而在做飯和做菜的辰光，預先把晚上和明天早上吃粥的質量增加在內。</p>
<p>講到晚餐這一頓粥的做法，當然和做早餐的做法相同；不同的地方，在於不用火油爐而改用煤球爐。因爲可以利用最後的餘火，燒些開水，貯藏在熱水瓶中，留待明天早上的使用。</p>
<p>末了，還得補充幾句，照上面的說法，不過寫個大概而已；如何運用之處，全在做主婦的隨時變化。粗看看，這「兩粥一飯」與「一粥兩飯」之間，好像相差無幾；但是細算算，單單薪炭一項，一年三百六十五天，就可省下不少哩！謂予不信，不妨試試。</p>
<h3>化妝瑣話</h3>
<p>— 菲</p>
<p>膚如凝脂，的確，這是充分的表現着肌膚的柔嫩潔滑而和脂膏凝聚般的可愛，不用說，也就是形容出你的美若天仙，而醉人心魂，可見柔嫩潔滑的肌膚，才是你美麗的基點，這個基點在科學美容的立塲上說來很簡單，就是不要忽視了你平日的肌膚宮養問題。</p>
<p>在你刷頭髮的時候，可以增加一倍的效力，方法如下：坐在一隻矮凳上，脚伸直，把頭向後仰，然後用髮刷刷，頭髮，這一種姿勢，可以使你的頭皮紅潤，達到康健的狀態。</p>
<p>潘麗茜拉蘭，在敷用面粉以後，用棉布蘸着古龍香水，把前額上多餘的粉質除去，然後把棉布絞得很乾，在面部各處拍去，這樣，面粉就牢在皮膚上了。</p>
<p>當你把眉毛刷淸之後，用顏色適當的眉筆，把眉毛引長，但不耍向下畫，因為向下以後，就容易顯出愁苦的樣子。</p>
<p>如果你有一點點多餘的香水，可以把牠放在電話筒的外面，可以免除臭味，實在是一個很實用的方法。</p>
<p>在晚上搽用面部霜膏的時候，可以用同一霜膏，搽在手部，再用粉敷上去，這可以使指甲油的顏色和皮膚的顏色，非常和諧。</p>
<p>剃鬚的肥皂，並不是男子的專用品，女子們也可以使用的，因爲牠的質料很柔油，要以使皮膚毛孔淸潔，並且在皮膚上面留了十分鐘以後，非常舒適。</p>
<h3>「家庭日記」</h3>

<h3>患肺癆者冬令應注意之各點</h3>
<p>— 虹</p>
<p>冬令因氣候塞冷，吾人最易患氣管炎症，氣管炎以咳嗽咯痰爲主要症狀，肺癆患者如再倂發氣管炎，則將益感痛苦，故應注意避免。其法爲多穿衣服，不可着冷，在溫熱之處，不可僅着原有衣服而驟至寒冷之地。</p>
<p>在併發有氣管炎及肺氣腫之肺癆患者，每屆冬令而發作益厲，頗足以影響身體之健康。此種患者，至冬令最須小心，應於其寓所中保持溫暖，出外時多着衣服。</p>
<p>肺癆病之開始，每呈發熱，咳嗽，咯痰等症狀，頗易與普通之傷風咳嗽相　，故如遇此等症象發生，如逾三星期以上而不愈者，最好應就醫者妥爲診查，不可一概認爲此乃冬令之普通傷風咳嗽以自誤也。</p>
<p>寒天吾人常於窒中生火以禦寒，惟此時每因火爐之烟囱裝接不妥，或用關閉小全之火爐，遂有煤烟積留室中，足以刺激患者發生咳嗆，殊屬不宜，故肺癆患者，以不用火爐而設水汀之暖氣爲佳。</p>
<p>冬令進補，此爲通俗之習慣。肺癆患者，在冬令可服魚肝油及注射各種維他命製劑，如維他命乙及內，以增進身體之抵抗，此外如牛乳鷄蛋等，亦復適宜。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>黄豆這樣東西，大家都知道是很常於維他命的；所以黄豆磨成的豆腐漿，要算是一樣最普遍的補品。黄豆的代價，雖比從前貴得多了，然而一碗豆腐漿，究竟比，一元多一鎊的牛奶要便宜不少。講到在菜肴中，這黄豆也天可利用，吃素的，可以來一碗黄豆炒甜醬，愛吃辣的，可以加些辣油在內，並且再加上金針木耳小油豆腐等，味兒很不惡。吃葷的，不但味美，也是滋補得很。你倘要經濟一些，那麽把肉片切片了絲，來一碗肉絲黄豆湯，也未爲不可。</p>
<p>星期一</p>
<p>黃豆燜肉片　蛤蜊　魚湯　清炒場窠菜　乾絲蒃豆芽</p>
<p>星期二</p>
<p>芹菜牛肉絲　紅燒花鰱頭　紅燒蘿葡絲　京冬菜粉皮</p>

<h3>化學閒話</h3>
<p>— 嫣虹</p>
<p>釀酒是人類最古最早的化學工藝之一。</p>
<p>氟氫酸的蒸汽，可使玻璃製成粗糙的表面（即砂玻璃）。</p>
<p>有人說，服了砒霜（氣化砷）可能負重物攀登高山，不會覺得艱難困苦，同時並能耐寒。</p>
<p>煤氣製造的副產品—煤膏在從前是一種廢物，但是在今日却當它是寳貝，因爲製造染料藥物，調味品，化妝香品，均需要煤膏來作原料。</p>
<p>醫生所用之蒙藥如：三氯化　（迷蒙精）乙醚（以脫）等在人道上講，實在是受到無上的利益。</p>
<p>氯氣或氯水，能漂白尋常的墨水（如鞣酸亞鐵等）但是不能漂白印刷用的油墨。（碳）</p>
<p>現代化學進步，把一切液體油用氫化方法處理，便能製成固體脂肪，來供製肥皂或當人造奶油出售。</p>
<p>用白堊粉和少量之硫化鈉用水來調成獎狀，塗擦年深日久失亮的銀器，可以立刻煥然一新。</p>
<p>食物腐敗的原因，大約有下列六種，水，光綫，空氣，金屬，酵素及微生物等。</p>
<p>髹塗油漆，切勿塗刷太厚，因爲一時不能乾燥，必致延長時日，故以薄塗數次，最爲相宜。</p>

<h3>棉花行前</h3>
<p>— 平堂</p>
<p>…表現上海之一…</p>
<p>嘟…嘟…嘟…</p>
<p>一大花行又裝滿了三卡車棉花飛馳着去了，坐在頂端的搬夫手執着長鞭向四周虎視，等待着驅散搶棉花的乞丐。</p>
<p>鄉下人挑的棉花，一袋袋在門前歇下，再開始漸漸地堆起，當秤的伙計掙得額角上滲着亮晶的汗珠，拼命提高着嘶啞的喉嚨叫喊。</p>
<p>他，謹愼地担着雪白的棉花，換着過去，蒼老而多皺紋的黑臉上，充滿着希望，衰弱無力的眼睛閃着微光，哎！怪討厭的，鼻尖的淸水鼻涕叉在掛了；於是，他提起袖子來一擦，順手往短襟上一揩。「咳！咳！』</p>
<p>輪着他了。他恭恭敬敬地呈上，顫抖底手按住了凸出的棉花，—別掉了一片珍貴的棉花哪！</p>
<p>『手放開！猪玀！』當秤的么喝着。</p>
<p>『唔——是！是！』他骨溜溜的眼睛吝嗇地盯住秤上底星子。「還得打出去一些，先生！」</p>
<p>「中下……四十六斤。』他的棉花放下去棄在一旁。</p>
<p>「先生！實在不止這份量喲！先生！請你重秤一下，不止的·」他的臉頓時變成哭喪着了，更顯得異樣的醜相，敎人見着挺不舒服底。</p>
<p>『滾！這兒不是搗蛋的地方。』當秤的怒吼着。『阿林！過來拉開他，賣不賣隨他。』</p>
<p>『來啦！』豎眉毛，凸眼珠，横肉臉，黑長杉捲起白衣袖的『白相人型』底阿林應着走近</p>
<p>『走走走！老朋友！識相點兒！』</p>
<p>『可是，先生！我秤好了五十斤的喲！天平秤一兩都不缺的。先生！能不能再秤一下哪！先生！……』他不怕煩的繼續地說。</p>
<p>『明明是四十六斤，秤一百遍，一千遍可還是四十六斤，到外頭去打聽打聽，我們這兒行裏從不待虧過誰，不瞞小，不欺老，好好地到裏頭去領錢，停會兒弄錯了可沒人會賠你。』那叫阿林的把他推到了帳房那兒，他乾癟的嘴却仍在翕翕地動。</p>
<p>『你是四十六斤的嗎，中下，四十九塊錢，拿去！』帳房先生數了一疊鈔粟給他，他可不拿，便放在檯角上。</p>
<p>『哎喲！先生！五十塊都不到嗎？唉！爲賣我的棉花，在過那「關」的時候，兩决給沒收，皮鞋向我踢，這是第三次了，還是「孝敬」了一塊大洋錢的。唉！唉！我們忙了一整年的心血喲！先生！五十塊總得湊個整數哪！先生！我化了錢下種，軋棉，過「關」，……先生！可憐可憐我吧！』沒有誰理他，只是他的獨語，眼淚，無顧忌地沿皺紋流下｛</p>
<p>『好走了，中下貨色四十九塊錢，並不少半個邊，要不然，你帶回去！』阿林話剛說已把他推出了門。</p>
<p>「唉天老爺！」他掮着扁担緩綏地走了，再留戀地向那人羣睃了一眼。</p>
<h3>你餓餓看！</h3>
<p>— 知之</p>
<p>這是一齣普遍的活劇，地點就在街市中。你別以爲這是街中小事，假使你深深的思索一下，也許爲駭怕起來，因爲這地點或者會改在你的家裏（？）</p>
<p>在偷雞橋，一個傢伙躡手躡脚的跟着一個臃腫的婦人。那婦人腋下挾着二個紙包，雙手提着幾隻紙匣，正招呼着一輛人力車。突然，那傢伙迅速的奔前一步，攫取了婦人腋下的二個紙包，似飛的跑着，一面已經撕開一個紙包，大嚼起來，一忽兒轉了個灣，已不見了。雖然那婦人極力嘶喊，可是人們都以爲這是小事（？）祇注目觀看，有的見了該婦的極狀，甚至哈哈的笑了。</p>
<p>我也順着轉了灣，當走過一條汚穢的弄堂時，那像伙正在把第二個紙包裏的雞蛋糕分派給他幼小的兒子，有一條辮子的女兒，還有他妻子懷中的幼兒。我的驀然出現，他抬了頭朝我一看。我苦笑着說：別怕我，我不…」「我並不怕你！」那傢伙搶着說。這個回答使我呆住了。「搶了東西還不怕？」我想着。「你不怕嗎？巡捕呢？」他爽快的回答。。「巡捕，我不怕，我怕肚子餓？」他說着，傴了腰輕輕的吻着他的幼兒。「你不明白嗎？那末你去餓餓看！」因爲我仍呆呆的凝視他，他惱了！「你不怕羞嗎？」我無意的又問了一句，他却對我笑笑，搖搖頭。當然，我太幼稚了，「衣食足而知榮辱」。</p>
<p>今天，一個媽的親戚，把被搶剩的東西給我們看，同時大家嘻嘻哈哈的笑了起來，隔壁的小孩哭着吿訴他的媽：「二個大餅搶脫勒！」他的嗎也笑了起來。</p>
<p>這是眞的可笑嗎？你想想看，要是這地點改在你的家裏（？）</p>
<h3>章臺柳</h3>
<p>— 頋明道</p>
<p>牧齋道：「夫人不要見資，我當然要死的，但想何必急急，一則金陵雖陷，敵兵尙未殺至虞山，其間儘有從容之餘地。二則江南忠義之士甚多，安知不有人勤王起義，別立魯王，效少康之中興，南宋之半壁？留着道個身體，也許將來自有用處。務要請你鑒諒我的苦心」。柳如是蛾眉一豎道：「卒！有什麼苦心？你無非怕死罷了。吾則何必這樣遲遲作態？我知道你暮氣已深，心志動搖，怎能及得文文山史閣部於萬一呢？枉恐你是一代尙書，騷壇祭酒，却是個偷生怕死的傖夫！明禮義者尙且如此，其他則又何說？哼！你眞是母狗了。往日的話都不足信。旣然你怕死，那麼又何必哄人呢。」柳如是從來沒有對牧齋發過怒的。今日可謂盛怒之下了。牧齋聽伊侃侃而道，理直氣壯，斷非自己遁辭所可對付，只好讓伊責備，耐着性子忍受。此時的牧齋大有唾面待乾的風度了。如是又接着說道：「我也並非狠心腸，逼你一同去死，祇因養有所不得不死，所以不欲苟活。忍辱含垢而生，何如揚烈激忠而死？古人所以有『寗爲袁粲死，不作褚淵生』的謠。今日你倘一死，自能名垂竹帛。假若偷生人間，那麼將來的事，波譎雲詭，不可說，也不忍說了。我要你死，就是愛你。你該明白春秋大義的，爲何今日這樣畏葸如庸人？怎不使我失望至於極點呢？」如是說到這裏，却把羅巾去拭着眼淚，伊此時眞的忍不住要哭了。牧齋露出一副尷尬面孔，立起身來，走至柳如是面前，連連作揖道：「如是如是，你切莫傷心。我很慚愧，辜負你一片好心。但我終欲得當以報國家，萬一不成，以死繼之。你千萬要鋻諒我的。徒死無益，並非是我怕死。」柳如是恨恨地說道：「明明是怕死，還要說什么不怕死？現在尚不能死，將來更豈能死？從今以後，我終不相信你的話了。唉！柳如是無負於你，而你却大大有負於我了。」牧齋只是作揖。且說道：「卿且稍緩，我決不負你的，我也感謝你的好意。」柳如是把螓首背轉了。一聲兒也不饗，並不理睬。牧察好生沒趣，自去將朝衣脫下，換却濕履。於是他不想死了。（二五）</p>

<p>自紹興七縣同鄉會發起籌建「浙紹醫院」以來，社會人士，極表關心，而對於是項事業之前途，因亦有不同之輿論，有謂本市木·煤·綢·酒·及銀錢各業，均有紹屬人士居其領袖，區區之款，不難立集，或謂紹人在本市商界之實力，固屬雄厚，然奈其吝嗇成性何，或謂紹人之熱心慈善者，大半係無產之人，富有者恒抱觀望態度。其實最近數十年來，旅滬紹人，已非昔比，深知閉關自守，難期發展，實行團結，足資互助，而對於桑梓福利，亦能盡其心力，今年紹屬災荒，急籌平糶，慕款近二百萬元，即爲明證。惟尙有不能自己於言者，即如上述所謂資產階級，終未能踴躍輸將，自以爲萬一生病，金錢萬能，不虞無完備醫院為之收容，自有中西名醫爲之診治，竟不顧自身之外，尙有親戚傭工，與夫貧苦之鄰里故舊，彼單掙扎於生活桎梏之下，惋轉於床辱呻吟之中，尚有餘力從事醫藥否乎？故「浙紹醫院」之建設，非僅職工階級，勞苦大衆，直受其惠，而身任經理老闆之中上級資產者亦未嘗不間接蒙其利，焉可袖手旁觀，固守門羅政策耶？</p>
<p>吾人試一思之，自吾同鄕會成立三十年來，因無醫院之設備，鄕人患病，如欲住一四朋醫院」，則須冒充甬人，始允入院，此種恥辱，應由富有同鄕負其全責，故在「浙紹醫院」未曾完成之前，凡屬紹人，不問富貴貧賤均應竭力勸募則巍巍大厦，不難實現矣。</p>

<h3>Germany Attempts to Expand the War Zone, Encourages Japan to Launch Southern Invasion, Japan Receives German Raider Ships in Various Ports, Pacific Situation Increasingly Tense, U.S. Extremely Concerned</h3>
<p>Manila – Sources within U.S. defense circles here believe that Germany is preparing to spread the war to the Pacific within a few weeks in order to oppose the British Empire and British shipping, and hopes that Japan will immediately engage in war with the United States. U.S. naval authorities here are paying close attention to reports that at least twelve German ships are being armed and are anchored in various ports within Japan and Japanese-occupied areas of China. It is said that some German ships operating from ports within Japanese-controlled areas have been replenishing fuel for German raider ships operating in Australian and Indian waters. It is also rumored that these fuel supply German ships are meeting the German raider ships in certain locations within the Japanese-mandated islands in the Pacific and supplying them with fuel. It is widely believed that the Germans have a plan to launch attacks against British shipping in the Pacific under the guise of assisting Japan's southward advance, and it is believed that Germany will use this as encouragement for Japan to counter the United States by attacking the Dutch East Indies, Singapore, or Thailand. Observers here believe that Germany's ultimate goal is to cause war between the U.S. and Japan in the Pacific within the next few months. Germany hopes that the United States will fight in the Pacific, so that once the United States declares war on Germany, it can prevent the United States from sending its navy to the Mediterranean to help Britain. Defense officials here also recall the recent incident in Kobe port, where the Norwegian oil tanker "Jacob" entered Kobe under the command of personnel from a captured German ship, refueled in the port, and left. Even a protest from the Norwegian Minister to the Japanese Foreign Ministry was ineffective. Reliable sources also said that the German ships "Ragenburg" and "Kembelan" left Japan in October and have not returned to this day. Reliable sources continued, that in addition to the German ships "Elsa Essberger," "Bergenland," "Scharnhorst," and "Ennerich Essberger" anchored in Kobe, "Saarland" anchored in Dalian, and "Elbe Altenwall" anchored in Yokohama, they are constantly supplied with fuel and other necessities. It is also reported that three German ships are anchored in Qingdao, and three more are anchored in other Chinese seaports, all of which can obtain fuel at any time and are being armed. U.S. defense authorities here also said that all German ships in the East could be fully armed by mid-January to form a force for Hitler to assist Japan's southern invasion, acting simultaneously with the German-initiated war in Southeast Europe. This plan is to prevent the U.S. fleet from leaving the Pacific and to cause war between the U.S. and Japan in the event that Britain urgently needs U.S. assistance in the Mediterranean. Reliable sources also say that foreign intelligence indicates that countless Germans arrived in Japan several months ago and that Hitler is pressing Japan to clash with the U.S. when Germany launches in Europe. Naval circles here are also aware that German ships are not only being used to attack British shipping in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but will also be used as the vanguard for Japan's attack on the Dutch East Indies. The authoritative sources here have also received various reports on the movement of Japanese troops from central and southern China to Taiwan and Hainan Island, and the completion of various preparations for Japan's southern advance. However, authoritative sources pointed out that there is no movement of Japanese troops in Guangdong Province, indicating that the Japanese fear of the Soviet Union has not been dispelled. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington - Reliable sources from Manila report that Japan is currently allowing twelve German ships in Japanese ports and Chinese ports under Japanese control to equip themselves with armaments and load food in order to carry out their raiding operations in the Pacific. It is also reported that German ships sailing from Japanese ports are now supplying German ships engaged in raiding in the Pacific. The ports involved in this activity are said to be Kobe, Dalian, and Qingdao. It is rumored that the U.S. Naval Department is closely monitoring this situation and is discussing what impact this would have on Japan's neutral status if the reports are true. Since receiving news of Axis naval activity in the Pacific, people here have been paying close attention to the Pacific and are frequently asking what Japan will do. The fact that the raiding ship that shelled Nauru Island obtained Japan's consent to fly the Japanese flag and use Japanese names, need not be mentioned. However, democratic countries often make loud complaints about any infringement of Japanese rights. It is strange that Tokyo remains silent about the abuse of its flag. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington - Authoritative sources here claim they have no knowledge of any German ship activity in Japanese ports, but added that Friday's attack on Nauru Island has become the first part of an overall Japanese-German collaboration problem. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Authoritative sources here refused to comment on reports that German ships are being supplied in Japanese ports. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<h3>Situation of the Shelling of Nauru Island by a German Warship</h3>
<p>Manila - Australian Navy Minister Hughes disclosed details of the German warship's bombing of Pleasant Island (i.e., Nauru Island), which is administered by Australia in the Pacific. Initially, the island's residents did not know that the ship was a warship, but they received a warning from the ship that the radio station on Pleasant Island must immediately stop broadcasting, or the ship would take military action. The ship then raised the German flag and opened fire on the oil tanks, but never fired on the people's homes. (Haitong Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>The Temporary Soviet-Japanese Fishing Agreement Will Expire Tomorrow, Both Sides Prepare to Reopen Negotiations</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Reports Oppose Further Concessions to the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Moscow - The validity period of the temporary Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement will expire on the 31st of this month. It is rumored that the two sides are about to reopen negotiations on this issue. This news was confirmed by a public announcement from the Soviet government. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Regarding Soviet-Japanese relations, the Japanese military's official newspaper, "Kokumin Shimbun," recently published an editorial commenting on the matter, stating, "Soviet-Japanese relations are unpredictable. For example, in the second half of last year, the Soviet Union adopted a tough diplomatic policy toward Japan. Unfortunately, the Abe Cabinet was too weak to cope with the situation at the time. As a result, only the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, and the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, signed a temporary fishing agreement, which, in Japan's view, is the most humiliating diplomacy since the establishment of the Treaty of Portsmouth between Japan and Russia. It is now learned that the terms of this year's fishing agreement will not necessarily be better than last year's temporary agreement. On this basis, it is almost impossible to sign a fundamental treaty with the Soviet Union under favorable conditions. However, we still hope that the future relations between Japan and the Soviet Union can have good development. Some people in the country believe that the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan may promote friendly relations between Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is expected that relations between Japan and the Soviet Union will improve. This theory has now proven to be inaccurate. On the contrary, at this time, Japan should abandon its policy of appeasing the Soviet Union. In other words, its approach to the Soviet Union should be no different from its approach to Britain and the United States. It is hoped that Foreign Minister Matsuoka will follow the Empire's diplomatic path and move forward bravely. It must be known that free fishing is Japan's last resort." "Hochi Shimbun" strongly advocated adjusting relations with the Soviet Union, stating, "If Japan wants to develop its national defense to the highest level and build a 'Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere,' it must adjust its relations with the Soviet Union on a friendly basis, and then concentrate its efforts on adjusting its internal structure to resolve the 'China Incident' and implement the southward advance. However, diplomatic negotiations with the Soviet Union should not be bound by procedures, but should integrate politics, economics, and military affairs into one furnace to conduct so-called 'total war' diplomacy. In short, the Japanese-Soviet fishing problem is extremely important to Japan, because the total value of fishing in the Northern Sea amounts to 150 million yen per year. Before the Sino-Japanese War, Japan exported 30 million yen worth of canned red salmon to the United Kingdom annually in exchange for a large amount of foreign exchange. The importance of this to the Japanese economy is evident here." (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" recently wrote an article saying that this is the golden opportunity to adjust Japanese-Soviet relations, hoping that the Soviet Union will quickly establish a fishing agreement with Japan. The newspaper pointed out that the current temporary treaty will expire on December 31, and stated that although the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union tried hard to approach the Soviet Union last year, there has been no progress in Japanese-Soviet negotiations.

<h3>The U.S. Next Year's Budget Is Enormous, Reaching 18 Billion Dollars</h3>
<p>Washington - The U.S. government is scheduled to submit a "triple budget" to Congress on January 7, which is divided into a special national defense expenditure of 10 billion U.S. dollars and regular expenses of 7 to 8 billion U.S. dollars. Therefore, the total expenditure for the 1941-42 fiscal year will reach 18 billion U.S. dollars, which is equivalent to the amount used by Britain during the war in 1918. According to the new budget, next year's revenue is expected to be between 7 and 8 billion U.S. dollars, which is sufficient to cover regular expenditures. The 10 billion U.S. dollars in military expenditures will be largely sufficient to implement President Roosevelt's new plan (i.e., to mass-produce military equipment and supplies for Britain to use and collect a small rent).

<h3>Japanese Residents in India Withdraw to Their Home Country</h3>
<p>Tokyo - 154 Japanese residents in India boarded the Japanese ship "Kasuga Maru" to withdraw to their home country and arrived here yesterday. Mr. Takamatsu, the director of Mitsui &amp; Co.'s branch office in Karachi, Bombay Province, India, was also among them. According to him, since the Indian authorities have strictly implemented the import permit system, Japan's exports to India have decreased sharply, with the cotton goods sector being the most affected.

<h3>President Roosevelt Delivers a Radio Address, Saying that the U.S. Would Rather Risk Aiding Britain than Avoid War</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver a "fireside chat" tonight. Regarding its nature, the President has given the public a full indication that it will attract national attention. However, the general news reporters have been unable to find out the exact content of the talk from the White House. When entertaining news reporters yesterday, the President avoided answering questions about the content of the talk. What is known to the public is that this talk must be related to the issue of aiding Britain. Isolationists recently criticized the President greatly for publishing a letter from 170 educators and others demanding active measures to defeat the Axis powers, which shows the panic of the isolationists. Therefore, the isolationists' clamor in Congress has made the President's broadcast tonight the key to a major dispute in foreign policy. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>New York - The Karl and Qing Investigation Association recently released voting statistics, showing that 60% of Americans today believe that the U.S. would rather risk getting involved in the war to help Britain than avoid war. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Department of the Army Plans to Strengthen the Air Force in Honolulu, Decides to Send "Flying Fortresses" to Fill the Defense, Another Bomber Squadron Will Fly to the Philippines, Yarnell Ordered to Take on Active Duty</h3>
<p>Washington - U.S. Army officials announced yesterday that the Department of the Army has already revised the plan for the 18th Army Bomber Squadron at Wheeler Field in Hawaii. The Department of the Army will soon send giant Army aircraft to fill the defense to replace the existing medium-sized B-18 bombers. It is said that the B-18 bombers may be sent to the Philippines, but Army officials could not know when they could send "Flying Fortresses" to Hawaii, because they will be given to the UK first. He said, "However, we will send these aircraft to Hawaii as soon as possible within the scope of possibility." The Department of the Army also announced that the authorities will establish three new squadrons of the Air Force in Hawaii, namely the 59th Bomber Squadron, the 44th Fighter Squadron, and the 19th Transport Squadron. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Newport - It is said that before his retirement, Admiral Yarnell, former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, received an order yesterday to go to Washington on Friday to take on active duty. Yarnell said that the nature of his appointment is currently unknown. He has been suffering from a serious cold and has only recently recovered. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The "Ta Kung Pao" recently wrote an editorial suggesting that the U.S. Navy should move to Singapore to implement a blockade of Japan, stating, "If the U.S. Navy takes the offensive, there will be three obstacles. First, if the U.S. Navy takes the offensive, the decisive battle must take place in the Japanese Sea. Japanese aircraft can be dispatched from their land bases to cooperate with the Japanese fleet. The U.S. Navy can only rely on aircraft dispatched from warships or aircraft carriers. Second, if the U.S. fleet moves from Honolulu to Japan, submarines near Japan and various islands between Honolulu and Japan may cause serious damage. Third, if the U.S. fleet uses Honolulu as its base of attack, destroyers and submarines may not be able to be fully utilized due to the distance from the base. Therefore, if the U.S. fleet wants to win, it must proceed to Singapore via the South Pacific, use that place as the main base, and use Manila and Hong Kong as forward bases. Aircraft dispatched from Manila and Hong Kong can provide the U.S. fleet with valuable assistance, and destroyers and submarines will each have a base closer to the battlefield, so that there will no longer be a danger of being intercepted by the Japanese fleet. If the Japanese fleet stays near its domestic bases and adopts a defensive posture, the U.S. fleet can block it and cut off its communication with the outside world. If possible, it can also cut off the connection between Japan and China, isolating its troops in China. This year's poor harvest in Japan means that its home must rely on food imported from China, Vietnam, and Thailand. The U.S. naval blockade will soon force Japan to submit. The U.S. Air Force stationed in Honolulu and the West Coast can prevent the Japanese navy from attacking those two regions. The U.S. fleet can leave Honolulu without hindering it." The newspaper concluded, "Once the U.S. fleet moves to Singapore, Japan's fate will be decided." (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Next Year's Budget</h3>
<p>Japan's 76th Diet convened on the 26th, and then adjourned as usual, to reconvene a month later. Since the establishment of Japan's first Imperial Diet in 1890, for a full fifty years, this year's session may be the most bleak and colorless. But this, in addition to being used to decorate the political season, also has a single important task, which is the passage of next year's budget.</p>
<p>The ordinary accounting section of Japan's budget for this year was prepared particularly late, and was not completed until the 9th of this month, and was submitted to the cabinet for discussion on the 10th, and was hastily passed in just one hour. The total is more than 6.863 billion yuan, which is more than 1.041 billion yuan more than this year's 5.822 billion yuan. This figure is naturally unprecedented in Japanese financial history. According to a statement by Japanese Finance Minister Kawada, "The new budget aims to thoroughly implement the principle of focusing on key points and saving, with the aim of dealing with changes in the international situation and completely resolving the 'China Incident,' so as to enrich military preparations, expand production capacity, and build a highly national defense." Therefore, the expenses of various provinces have generally increased. According to this principle, the provinces of Army, Navy, Agriculture, Commerce, and Foreign Affairs should naturally increase the most, but compared with last year's budget figures, the province that increased the most was the Ministry of Finance, with a total of 31.8 million yuan, followed by the Ministry of Navy with 21.4 million yuan, and the 10 million yuan increased by the Ministry of the Army was only similar to the provinces such as Communication, which is really pitifully weak compared to the U.S.'s huge military expansion budget! Although the expenses of the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry have increased, the unproductive consumption has also risen sharply. For example, the public debt interest under the Ministry of Finance has already reached more than 900 million yuan this year, and the increase next year may be even greater than the amount increased by the budget. The 10 million yuan increase in the Ministry of Communications is said to be for the expansion of aviation needs, but the amount of death pensions for soldiers transferred by the province has increased year by year, more than doubled compared to the past. What's more, the purchasing power of Japanese currency is lower than before, and the price of military equipment is rising day by day, so the number of ordinary military and administrative expenses in Japan next year, even if it increases compared to the past, is limited by financial resources and is virtually reduced. Who believes that it can really achieve the goal of enriching military preparations and completing a high level of national defense?</p>
<p>But this is only the ordinary accounting part of Japan's entire budget. As for the temporary special military expenditure budget, which has always been equal in amount to it, it has not yet been announced, and it is said that it will not be determined until next spring. This situation is also different from previous sessions. Although there is no way to speculate on its amount now, judging from the current situation of Japan's war against China, it will not be less than this year's 445 million yuan. Although the Japanese zaibatsu are doing their best to plunder the occupied areas, the income is ultimately limited. In addition, if we add the necessary expenses for preparing for the southward advance, the amount will be even more than this. The reason why it has not been determined for a long time is probably because the southward advance is still in the midst of indecision. It does not want the outside world to see its future direction from the special military expenditure budget, and it does not want to stimulate domestic and foreign listeners with an excessively large number. According to general speculation, in any case, this amount must be higher than this year. Let's take a step back here and assume that it is still at this year's level, then the total of the ordinary budget part has reached more than 11.31 billion yuan. This number is far from being reached by the world's major powers, such as Britain and Germany in the war, and the Soviet Union and the United States, which are neutral. Compared with Japan twenty years ago, it has increased tenfold—that was the peak of the prosperity of Japanese imperialism, but now it is approaching the extreme of poverty. Therefore, how to implement this budget has become a major problem for the Japanese authorities in the future.</p>
<p>According to Japanese statistics, last year Japan's total national income was only 26 billion yuan. Even if it does not decrease next year, the total budget amount has reached 45% of it. This is a rare phenomenon in any country. What's more, Japan's production and foreign trade are shrinking rapidly. The more urgent Japan's desire to expand in the future, the worse the international situation will be, the sharper the national income will be, and the more weakened the ability to bear the burden will be. Looking at the government's revenue items listed on the budget table, there are only 4.2 billion yuan, which is more than 2 billion yuan less than the ordinary budget part, which has been stipulated to be offset by issuing more government bonds. And the 445 million yuan of the temporary military expenditure part (assuming it is still only this number) is completely unsettled. According to Japanese newspapers, it is feared that taxes will have to be increased. In fact, by the end of November, Japan's national debt had accumulated to more than 26.9 billion yuan, and of the more than 7 billion yuan newly issued in the past two years, more than 1 billion yuan has not been digested. The prediction of "national bankruptcy due to public debt" has now begun to show signs. Next year, it has been stipulated to issue another 2 billion yuan. If the special military expenditure item is to be completely offset by government bonds, it is naturally impossible, and the path of increasing taxes is also not optimistic. This year, it has been determined to increase tax revenue, and the income is only more than 2.5 billion yuan, averaging 35 yuan for each Japanese person, which is huge. At this time, the phenomenon of depression is increasing day by day, and it is impossible to increase the burden on the people. In addition to government bonds and tax increases, the remaining outlets are only increasing the issuance of banknotes and absorbing private deposits. However, the total amount of Japanese banknotes issued before September this year was always around 3.3 billion yuan, and by the end of November, it had soared to 3.75 billion yuan. The surface of the phenomenon of inflation has become inevitable. If it is reissued, it will inevitably stimulate price increases and make people's lives more and more difficult. As for the deposit problem, the postal savings that the Japanese government relies on most have been shrinking day by day with the general economic decline, and bank deposits have also decreased. Like the 1 billion yuan savings fundraising plan that the Japanese government touted at the end of last year, it will be difficult to apply it next year. Therefore, although the Konoe Cabinet has been actively promoting fascism to strengthen government control, the people's strength is exhausted, and even if it drains the pond to catch all the fish, it may not be able to cope with the needs of that unprecedented budget.</p>
<p>Japan's budget must be submitted to the Diet for approval as usual, but the parliament does not have the power to veto the budget. What's more, at this time, the constitutional system exists in name only. Even if there are customary questions for embellishment, they will have no effect. Therefore, after the parliament reconvenes next year, there is no problem with the full passage of the budget. But no matter what methods the Japanese authorities adopt to implement this budget, the only result is to deepen Japan's internal and external difficulties to the point of collapse.</p>
<h3>Commander-in-Chief Chiang's Order to All Agencies: Strictly Suppress Stores and Businesses Hoarding and Speculating, Goods Accumulated Must Be Sold Within a Time Limit, Those Who Violate the Order Will Have Their Goods Confiscated and Be Punished by Military Law, Earnestly Protect the Legitimate Business Operations of Law-Abiding Merchants</h3>
<p>Chongqing – In order to thoroughly stabilize grain and commodity prices, suppress hoarding, and protect the legitimate business operations of law-abiding merchants, Commander-in-Chief Chiang issued a personal order two days ago, instructing the Ministry of Social Affairs, the National Grain Administration, the Price Stabilization Purchasing and Sales Office, and the Chongqing Municipal Government, among other agencies, to strictly implement certain instructions. The key contents, as gleaned from relevant sources, are as follows: (1) All stores, businesses, and private individuals who are hoarding various grains and essential daily necessities must sell them as much as possible before January 26th of the 30th year of the Republic (i.e., Lunar New Year's Eve) to supply the market and the needs of the people. If it is anticipated that they cannot be completely sold by this deadline and there are still surplus grains and goods accumulated, they should register the remaining quantities separately with the grain management agencies and the Price Stabilization Purchasing and Sales Office or the local competent authorities, accurately reporting the true amount for continued supply and sales. (2) All hoarded grains and goods that are not voluntarily sold within this deadline or are not reported and registered in accordance with the order will be treated as hoarding and speculation. In addition to confiscating the grains and goods, they will be severely punished according to military law without leniency. (3) All those who sell and register in accordance with the order will have their legitimate profits guaranteed by the government. (4) The Ministry of Social Affairs and the Municipal Government should supervise the trade associations of various industries to complete their organization. All law-abiding merchants originally in operation should continue to operate as usual and are not allowed to suspend business, and the government will earnestly protect their legitimate profits in business. (5) Hereafter, anyone, regardless of who they are, who has not joined a trade association will not be allowed to privately purchase and hoard grains and goods exceeding the quantity for personal use, in order to protect legitimate business operations. Those who are hoarding should be handled in accordance with the provisions of item (1) above until the sales are completed. (6) For all grains and goods purchased by central and local party, government, and military agencies, factories, etc., except for public grains and goods that are required for official duties as stipulated by laws and regulations (such as the Military Grain Administration, the Price Stabilization Purchasing and Sales Office, and other agencies), the rest, such as grains and goods purchased for the consumption of employees, must be approved by the grain and goods management agencies or purchased on their behalf, and the appropriate quantity to be purchased and the verification methods should be stipulated. The grains and goods that have already been purchased and stored should also be registered and verified in accordance with regulations to prevent fraud. The types of grains and goods to be regulated in the above items, the temporary profit standards, and other relevant implementation measures should be earnestly discussed and formulated by the relevant agencies, and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation for implementation before the 31st of this month. After this strict rectification and maintenance of legitimate business operations by Commander-in-Chief Chiang, it is expected that the prices of grains and goods in our city and Sichuan Province will gradually return to normal.

<p>Chongqing – A certain company in this city hoarded 10,000 bolts of cloth. After being investigated and verified by the Bureau of Standards, its assistant manager was arrested yesterday, and the manager is at large and currently being pursued. The Bureau of Standards has decided to continue to severely punish this kind of unscrupulous merchant, but will still protect legitimate merchants. Mayor Wu Guozhen yesterday summoned the heads of various trade associations to a meeting, clarifying this intention. The heads of various industries expressed unanimous support and were willing to report those who hoard and speculate, but hoped that a definition of hoarding could be established, namely: (1) those who do not sell within a certain period of time, (2) those who seek illegal profits, and (3) those whose hoarded quantities exceed a certain limit. In addition, it is hoped that this matter can be handled by a centralized agency. (28th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The National Government is resolutely implementing policies to curb hoarding and speculation. Many more people have been arrested in recent days. It is reported that there are 19 cotton yarn merchants who have been accused of speculation and hoarding, and many butchers and meat merchants have also been arrested and released on bail. In addition, a certain county magistrate was also arrested for hoarding goods. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly War Situation: From the 22nd to the 28th</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the war situation in various places this week (from the 22nd to the 28th) has developed to a stage where the Chinese army's attrition strategy has been successful. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>In the Jin-Sui area, the Chinese army in Shanxi Province has been extremely active. They surrounded and attacked the Japanese army invading Pingshun, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers. The Chinese army then launched separate attacks, depleting the Japanese army's strength. The transportation between Luwei, Huping, Pingwen, and the area between Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Qinshui has mostly been destroyed. Many of the outer strongholds in these areas have been seized by the Chinese army. The war situation in the southwestern Shanxi, Henan and Hebei area is particularly tense. On the south side of Zhongtiao Mountain, on the evening of the 21st, the Japanese army was ambushed in Bazheng Village. The Japanese army, which had been reinforcing from An(yi) and Yun(cheng) for several days, was also routed by the Chinese army. Jie County, Xia County, Wenxi, Ronghe, Linjin, Yongji and other places were simultaneously attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese army, which had invaded from Hong(tong) and Zhao(cheng), has been routed. When the Japanese army invaded Lin County from the west of Lifu, the Chinese army cut off their rear and is currently concentrating on annihilating them. The Japanese army in Suiyuan and northwest of Anbei, after being routed, invaded 24 Fenzi, Yu Taichuan, Ma Yuantugou and other places. After the Chinese army attacked their flanks with surprise troops, they retreated to An(bei) Gu(yang).</p>
<p>In the Lu-Yu area, the Japanese army invaded Dingtao from Juye and was routed by the Chinese army in Ji Lou, Yuan Cao and other places. The Japanese army, which invaded from Pingyin, Wei County, Jinan and other places, was killed by the Chinese army, with more than 700 casualties. The Japanese army in Wande was besieged by the Chinese army. When the Japanese army in Jinan rushed to support them, they were intercepted and attacked by the Chinese army, killing more than 400 Japanese soldiers. The Japanese trains on the Jiaoji Railway struck mines a total of three times, destroying two locomotives, more than ten carriages, and destroying military supplies such as alcohol and gasoline. The Japanese suffered heavy losses. The Japanese army invading north of Changtaiguan in Henan Province was routed by the Chinese army in Wangchang. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to attack Liulin, Lijiazhai, Xinyang, and the south, burning more than 100 Japanese barracks, destroying more than ten kilometers of the Pinghan Railway, and recovering more than 1,000 catties of electric wires. On the 23rd, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese headquarters in Kangdian near Luoshan. The Japanese army was caught off guard and retreated. The Japanese army that invaded Han Tai from Qincheng was annihilated by the Chinese army, and the Chinese army pursued them, approaching the suburbs and destroying their fortifications. The bridges near Xiaoji on the Jixin Road were destroyed by the Chinese army. The Japanese army, which invaded eastward from Huaiyang, was attacked by the Chinese army near Yanlou, with more than 300 casualties, and retreated.</p>
<p>In the E-Xiang area, the Chinese army in eastern Hubei routed the Japanese army invading the area south of Huang(mei) and Guang(ji), capturing Zheng Gong Ta and other places. The Japanese army fled to Baitu Lake. The Chinese army in southern Hubei destroyed more than 30 places on the highway between Jieshou and Mushi Port and destroyed more than ten bridges. The Chinese army attacking Daye and Echeng achieved many victories. The Chinese army near Bai Niqiao annihilated the Japanese army three times. The remaining Japanese army retreated to Chongyang and other places. Fierce battles between the Chinese and Japanese armies occurred in Shishan, Xin Dianzhen and other places. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. The Japanese army near Jingmen in western Hubei fought with the Chinese army in Guanyin Temple South and Xing Muling and other places. Nearly a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Yichang shelled Meizixi and Baozigang on the opposite bank, firing poisonous gas shells.

<h3>Nazi Forces Extend to the Black Sea; The Soviet Union is on Strict Alert, Military Control of the Odessa Region; Germany Re-Offers Security Guarantees to Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Budapest – According to reports received here today, all foreign ships have been prohibited from entering Romanian ports on the Black Sea under Nazi occupation. This ban coincides with the Soviet Union's declaration of martial law in Odessa. According to this measure, Romania not only prohibits foreign ships from entering all coastal areas of the Black Sea today, but also ordered a reduction in railway passenger transport to expand military transport. At the same time, it also said that the Soviet Red Army's reinforcements are concentrating in large numbers on the Black Sea coast and its vicinity, including the Romanian districts. At the same time, the Odessa region was declared under emergency military control. It is reported that after Germany and Italy opposed the Soviet Union's request to control the mouths of the Danube River and the Bucharest conference broke down, Shabolev, the leader of the Soviet delegation to the Danube International Commission, suddenly rushed to Berlin from Bucharest. This news made the situation in the Balkans even more tense. Neutral diplomatic circles believe that Germany may launch an attack on Britain and Salonika simultaneously in February next year.

<h3>Turkey's Foreign Policy is Willing to Cooperate with Neighboring Countries to Maintain Peace in the Balkans</h3>
<p>Ankara – Turkey's foreign policy shows an absolute state of peace at the end of this year. The negotiations between Turkey and Bulgaria are still proceeding diplomatically, and the situation has eased, and the result of repairing old friendships may be obtained. Turkish newspapers are promoting close cooperation between the Balkan countries. Although Turkey's attitude has not changed due to British pressure, the British ambassador's talks with the Turkish president were about commercial matters and did not involve political issues. What was discussed was the shortage of British goods transported to Turkey. Britain's attempt to drag Turkey into adventures in Syria also failed. Turkey's unwillingness to participate in foreign political events is that the war against Britain has reached a decisive period. Turkey's domestic policy is to pay attention to the government's power and the laws to protect the country's economic life, so that the government can implement its policies to command the country's economy and finances.

<h3>Italian Prisoners March Through the Streets of Athens: Where is Caesar's Mighty Spirit Now?</h3>
<p>Athens: An international news agency reporter stood on the sidewalks of Athens with the Greek people for over an hour to watch Mussolini's fascist legions parade through the streets of Athens. They traveled ten miles from Baeniaus to Athens, but this procession was not to boast of their victory; they had no glory to speak of. No one dared to hold their heads high; they were merely seen as ragged, dejected, and disillusioned troops, a defeated and broken army with unkempt hair and dirty faces. Most of them were young men, between the ages of 22 and 26, all belonging to the Italian elite forces. The reporter gave several cigarettes to two of them and spoke to them. One, named Falini, was from Florence, and the other, named Masca, was from Trieste. Both were members of a suicide squad. Falini told the reporter, "We never expected such an outcome. But the past is past, and the Greeks are treating us well, which is somewhat comforting. Our soldiers, even the officers, believe that the war is over and that continuing to fight is pointless. In reality, almost no one wants to fight; we are just following orders." Mussolini's army marched through Athens like a flock of domesticated sheep, not like the fierce wolves and tigers of Caesar's legions. (International News dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>"Guangyuan" Ship Sold to Australian</h3>
<p>Chinese Crew's Successful Struggle; Three-Year-Old Case Resolved</p>
<p>San Francisco: The case of the Chinese two-masted ship "Guangyuan," which has been stalled here for a long time, has now been resolved. The ship has now been sold to Sir Carpenter of Australia and will serve in the South Pacific. The three-year-old case has finally been resolved. The patriotic struggle of the ship's two Chinese crew members, Wang Qifu and Zhu Jizhou, has also been successful. In 1937, the ship was sold to a Japanese businessman to transport US$64,000 worth of scrap iron from the United States to Japan. However, war suddenly broke out, and the Chinese sailors on board unanimously refused to work, and the Chinese Consulate General also refused to issue the ship a license, resulting in a lawsuit between the two parties. Finally, the US Supreme Court ruled that the ship should be judged by the Chinese Consul. To date, the "Guangyuan" has been sold to a third party, and it is now reported that it will change its flag to Panama and sail in the South China Sea. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>

General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French, issued a broadcast last night, urging French leaders to draw their swords and fight again, saying that there is nothing to do but fight. Since the armistice, nearly a thousand French naval and air officers and soldiers have died for the country. If French Africa, Syria, and the French fleet now fight for the country again, the war in the Mediterranean can be ended and France can achieve a great victory. All French people, no matter where they are, what their position is, or what their thoughts are, if they all rise up and fight, we are willing to follow them without any conditions. Any French leader, no matter what mistakes they have made in the past, if they draw their swords and rise up again, they will see all of us following without any ambition. General de Gaulle asked all French people to close their doors and stay inside for one hour to silently show the world that France's future lies in freedom, France's greatness lies in independence, and France's liberation lies in victory.

<h3>Qin Bi Gao Injured on the Field, Tung Wah Suffers Unprecedented Defeat Yesterday; First Division League: French Business Wins 4-1; Li Yichen Scores Penalty to Salvage One Goal</h3>
<p>The ever-victorious Tung Wah football team suffered its first Waterloo in the First Division League yesterday morning, losing 4-1 to French Business, an unprecedented defeat. The score was 1-1 at halftime, with Li Yichen scoring a penalty for Tung Wah. Otherwise, the entire army was defeated. Yesterday's game was the second round of the First Division. There were over two thousand spectators at Yiyuan. In the first round, Tung Wah won 2-1. Yesterday, Tung Wah performed abnormally. New player Chen Yutian was out of sync, and the forward line was like a pile of loose sand. Qin Bi Gao was injured early in the game, so his performance was not as good as before. Qin cannot escape blame for the first two goals conceded. French Business, on the other hand, took advantage of their victory over St. Francis, and played skillfully. Forwards Bouthiaux, Djimwater, and Piaut were fierce and good at fighting, and the defense was impenetrable, leaving Tung Wah at a loss and creating an upset. The lineups of both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>French Business Association</p>
<p>Pain Remy</p>
<p>Rossel, Collet Bel, Pan Kou Lai, Schreger</p>
<p>Smith, Djimwater, Bouthiaux, Milov, Appleyard Goff</p>
<p>Tung Wah Association</p>
<p>Qin Bi Gao</p>
<p>Li Ning, Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Liang Shutang, Huang Kehou, Han Longhai</p>
<p>Wu Binghao, Li Yichen, Chen Yutian, Fei Chunhua, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Penalty Kick Ties the Score</p>
<p>Tung Wah kicked off. Collet blocked it and took the opportunity to attack. Appleyard Goff got the ball and hooked it in. Smith headed it off target. Before long, Appleyard regrouped. At an opportune spot, he raised his foot and shot. Qin jumped up and hit it, but collided violently with Bouthiaux and fell injured. Qin, severely injured by this, tried his best to fight, but his performance was abnormal. Twenty-five minutes in, Appleyard shot from outside the box. Qin Bi Gao blocked it but was not steady, and Bouthiaux rushed up and poked it in. Tung Wah conceded the first goal. After that, Tung Wah tried to attack many times, but failed to score. At thirty minutes, Wu Binghao had an excellent opportunity, dribbling straight into the penalty area. The French Business defender was outside and could not catch up. Binghao intercepted the ball and shot at close range, a few yards in front of the goal. Because he was too hasty, he shot over the crossbar. The spectators all regretted it. Five minutes before the end of the first half, Pan Kou Lai fouled Li Yichen in the penalty area and was called for a penalty. Li Yichen kicked the ball and it fell into the net, tying the score (1-1). Soon after, the first half ended, with the teams evenly matched.</p>
<p>The Second Half Sees Three More Goals Conceded</p>
<p>After changing ends, Tung Wah got two corner kick opportunities, but failed to capitalize on them. Djimwater came forward and kicked the ball, and the Tung Wah goal was breached again (1-2). After ten minutes of melee, Tung Wah's attack was strong, but they all missed by a hair. At twenty-five minutes, Bouthiaux got the ball and passed to Smith, who pulled the trigger, Qin Bi Gao dived but could not save it (1-3). In the last minute, Bouthiaux repeated the trick, getting the ball from Appleyard Goff and passing it to Smith, who scored easily (1-4). Tung Wah lost two goals in two minutes, and their morale plummeted, making them play even more slackly. Although there were one or two shooting opportunities, they were all easily saved by the opponent. When the whistle blew, Tung Wah suffered a crushing defeat of 1-4.</p>

<h3>The Future of the Sino-Japanese Currency War – Original Title: Regarding "Third Type of Paper"</h3>
<p>— Gu Liaozhai</p>
<p>On Christmas night, Bohe Ong's relatives and friends celebrated Ong's birthday with toasts. I, a humble one, drove to offer congratulations and met with gentlemen such as Xi Qiao, Jian Xiang, Qing Shi, Shao Qiu, Bao Rong, Qiu Wei, and An Lun. Old friends and new acquaintances, happily gathered at a feast. Amidst the clinking of glasses, there was no shortage of stories of heroic deeds in troubled times. Discussions ranged from ancient times to the present, focusing on the "Reserve Bank Notes" of Jiangning, with opinions converging from various angles. Xi Qiao, in a humorous manner, referred to it as the "Third Type of Paper." Returning home, the memories of what I heard were still vivid in my mind. I hastily tried to record them, but I only managed to capture less than half. Although it cannot compare with the previous symposiums held by this publication, it is still sufficient to provide fodder for conversation after tea and meals.</p>
<p>The Bride and the Concubine</p>
<p>Xi Qiao… "Federal Reserve Notes" are the "First Type of Paper," "Hua Yu" is the "Second Type of Paper," so the new product from Jiangning, being launched with much fanfare, should be the "Third Type of Paper,"... (Laughter). But each generation is worse than the last!... (Laughter)</p>
<p>Qiu Wei　Don't forget the military scrip.</p>
<p>Xi Qiao　Although they are similar in nature, they are different in form.</p>
<p>Bao Rong　Japan has always opposed it because it will affect military scrip. Military scrip is Japan's only source of funds for paying soldiers and buying Chinese local products. Why is it being stirred up now?</p>
<p>Shao Qiu　None of the four types is useful; none is qualified to affect the other! The Japanese military's objection is just to restrain Jiangning; North China is using this to squeeze out Jiangning and maintain the "Federal Reserve Bank"; the "Hua Xing" troops already have power and position in the new organization, so it doesn't matter. The real opponents of the new plan are Japanese businessmen and more insightful intellectuals. Figures in the Kasumigaseki diplomatic circles also do not express sympathy. Japanese zaibatsu are even more against it. Actually, regardless of who opposes it or who supports it; no one has a definite solution. The problem is that the power of the legal tender is too great, but Japan is desperately poor. To obtain Chinese local products and seize the wealth of the Chinese people, it is necessary to use legal tender. Although their opportunities and possibilities for collecting legal tender are not small, they are ultimately limited. The limited income is not enough for the endless needs, so they often want to create a tool that can be endlessly exploited. "Federal Reserve Notes," "Hua Xing Coupons," and military scrip have been tried repeatedly and have failed repeatedly. They cannot even be used generally in the markets of the occupied areas. When they are forced to be accepted under duress, prices are raised; therefore, their value is actually lower than that of legal tender. Moreover, those without a violent background must pay with legal tender. To ensure that the raw materials they buy are more standardized and convenient, Japanese merchants would rather raise a sum of legal tender first before trading, which is quite ridiculous. When they are eager to buy raw materials, they often use legal tender payment as an advertisement to lure brokers and win over sellers. The more tricks they play, the more expensive the prices in the occupied areas become. As a result, Japanese merchants face even greater difficulties. High costs for Japanese merchants affect domestic prices in Japan. Japanese price policy is at a loss, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is often criticized by all sides as mediocre and incompetent. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry knows that what the military is doing is wrong, but the military prides itself on "exploiting material resources." However, Chinese local products are transported to Japan through the hands of Japanese merchants. Therefore, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and even the Ministry of Finance, must take some consideration of the interests of Japanese merchants in China. To guarantee the interests of Japanese merchants in China, there is no other way but to admit that the prices quoted in Japanese yen cannot be too far from those quoted in military scrip or legal tender. Otherwise, Japanese merchants in China will suffer too much, and their interest in shipping goods back to Japan will also be greatly reduced. The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry cannot sever the causal relationship between prices in the Chinese occupied areas and those in Japan. In recent months, they have tried every possible way to raise the price of military scrip so that Japanese merchants in China can use military scrip to buy goods, slightly reducing their costs, and ensuring that they do not suffer too much when shipping goods back to Japan. However, the effect of raising the price of military scrip can only be seen at the ticket windows of a few controlled railways and highways. Once it reaches the commodity market, it is still bleak and colorless. Therefore, they are now fantasizing and reversing their obstruction of the new "Central Bank" plan and permitting it. However, their purpose is exactly the opposite of ×××. They intend to use the "Third Type of Paper" as a "sacrificial lamb."</p>
<p>Qiu Wei　Japan has tried many ways to raise the price of military scrip. They even considered how to reduce the issuance so that military scrip would be used exclusively for paying soldiers and for the Japanese military in China to purchase materials, reducing other uses. Therefore, in September of this year, they revealed seven measures: (1) Not approving the establishment of new enterprises in China; (2) Requiring prior application for the construction of civil engineering projects in China; (3) Restricting Japanese people from coming to China; (4) Restricting remittances to China; (5) Strengthening trade control between the occupied areas and the rear; (6) Implementing a licensing system for all profit-making businesses; (7) Raising the price of goods shipped back to Japan, etc. But the result only showed the intensification of the conflict of interest between Japanese merchants in China and Japanese merchants in Japan. The real purpose of these measures is only to maintain the preferential interests of Japanese merchants already in China and prevent competition from those who continue to come to China. After September of this year, the value of military scrip rose sharply for a time, which was said to be the result of a large-scale speculative activity authorized by the Japanese military to a certain Japanese commercial bank. It bought heavily around seventy-seven yuan, and general speculators dumped heavily; when the time came, a short squeeze occurred, and they realized they had been tricked and washed their hands of it. Therefore, when the Japanese commercial bank wanted to unload at a high price, there were no buyers, resulting in today's situation of "there is a market but no transactions." Because this kind of speculation is more dangerous than other kinds of speculation. It is easy to buy, but there are no counterparts to sell to. As for harming the country and the people, it goes without saying!</p>
<p>Jian Xiang　Professor Yu, you said that Japan intends to use the "Third Type of Paper" as a "sacrificial lamb," and that its price can only be raised at the ticket windows of trains and buses. Once it leaves the window, it cannot compete with legal tender. Therefore, it wants to create a "competitor" that is destined to fail, so that the price of military scrip can be a little bit stronger than another "currency" in the market of the occupied areas. Therefore, ×××'s plan is the ideal "sacrificial lamb." Moreover, according to their wishful thinking, the "Third Type of Paper" is linked to legal tender at par, so the sacrifice of the "Third Type of Paper" should also sacrifice legal tender at the same time. But the ghostly "Hua Xing Coupons" were also "linked at par" with legal tender when they were first issued; legal tender is still legal tender, and "Hua Xing Coupons" ultimately could not escape the fate of a ghost and died young. The fate of the "Third Type of Paper" will be no different.</p>
<p>Xi Qiao　The concubine must be inferior to the bride, otherwise it would be embarrassing to appear inferior! This policy must be used even more when the bride is ugly!... (Laughter)</p>
<p>The Difficult Birth and Future of the "Third Type of Paper"</p>
<p>Qing Shi　The monthly expenses of the Jiangning organization have increased from ten million to sixteen million, which is the inevitable result of rising prices. However, the so-called income is only five or six million to ten million per month, with a monthly shortfall of seven or eight million. They repeatedly asked the Japanese to allocate some of the financial resources, such as permits to move goods out, to them; but what they received was too little. Most of the income from kidnapping and other activities goes into private pockets; issuing permits to move goods out also only benefits a few people, and those who are not relatives or friends cannot buy them. Monkeys don't want to go to orchards that don't bear fruit. Issuing non-convertible banknotes is easier than making wax fruit products after all. But wax fruit products can still be used as decorations; of course, they can be forced upon the people in the occupied areas. However, issuing non-convertible banknotes is a complete waste of time. Therefore, although the so-called "Provisional Measures for Reorganizing Currency" stipulate that all expenses of "government agencies" should be paid in the "Third Type of Paper," it also adds a sentence "not applicable in specific areas for the time being." This is clear proof that they themselves do not want it. Therefore, I dare to assert that the outflow will inevitably equal the entire inflow in the future. Just like today's military scrip, the entire amount issued is almost entirely on the books of Japanese commercial banks. The Japanese are patting themselves on the back, thinking that this is the success of the military scrip policy, thinking that it has become a "reserve currency." Little do they know that this is precisely the price they have obtained for selling Japanese goods several times that amount in the Chinese occupied areas. No wonder Japanese merchants and Chinese people are both complaining bitterly.</p>
<p>Qiu Wei　Don't say that merchants are complaining, even the Japanese government is complaining bitterly. The Japanese military in China uses military scrip to pay soldiers and forcibly purchases goods in the occupied areas. As soon as merchants in the occupied areas receive military scrip, they try their best to turn it into goods. The markets in the occupied areas have become markets for Japanese goods. Therefore, as a result of dumping Japanese goods, they have received the military scrip issued by the military. If Japanese goods were not continuously sold to China, military scrip would have no way out; the price of military scrip would inevitably plummet. However, Japan is suffering from a shortage of materials and a shortage of foreign exchange; in order to obtain foreign exchange, it comes to China to dump goods. As a result, it has backfired on itself, which is truly laughable. Therefore, Japanese merchants have witnessed the failure of "Federal Reserve Notes," "Hua Xing Coupons," etc., and at the same time discovered the greatness of the value of legal tender, so they have always advocated using legal tender, maintaining legal tender, and opposed the issuance of military scrip. They really hate "Third Type" and "Fourth Type" even more. ××× has racked his brains and run his legs many times for the "Third Type Bank," always exchanging enthusiasm for cold air; this is also one of the main reasons.</p>
<p>Shao Qiu　Yes! Yes! The material shortage in Japan has now reached its peak. On the one hand, it feels that exports to China are not profitable, and on the other hand, it encounters overseas markets rejecting Japanese goods; therefore, it is always dreaming of one day thinking of a plan to fully seize Chinese local products with very few materials, or even without the need for materials. Raising the price of military scrip may be one of the means of their current plan. But the market at the ticket window of the Zhabei Railway Station is too small; the Japanese commercial bank that was ordered to conduct multi-head speculation in September and October of this year is still spinning around in a market with transactions but without trade, unable to get rid of it. Wanting to create another sacrificial lamb to replace the fate of military scrip will inevitably make the circulation area of military scrip narrower, because the places where military scrip can flow can probably also flow to the third type of paper. The places where military scrip cannot flow, the third type of paper certainly has no hope of flowing to. Therefore, although no one is qualified to affect anyone, mutual squeezing is inevitable. This is another reason for exchanging enthusiasm for cold air. Now, ××× is not only making concessions to military scrip, but even making concessions to "Federal Reserve Notes," no longer trying to monopolize the right to issue currency in the occupied areas, only to exchange for a "yes." However, North China was designated as a "Federal Reserve Note area" long ago, and Central China and South China were designated as military scrip areas long ago. "Federal Reserve Notes" in North China still cannot compete with legal tender to this day; it is only because the Japanese military in North China does not issue another type of banknote itself that it can be forcibly circulated at the points and lines where the Japanese military is stationed. As for Central China and South China, the Japanese military is unwilling to give up its existing territory for military scrip, and its territory is really pitifully small; in other words, it can only be active in the ticket offices of a few major stations along the railways and highways; it cannot intervene beyond that. The failure of "Hua Xing Coupons" was because it had no territory. The fate of this "Second Type of Paper" cannot escape this fate. In the past, the "Hua Xing" side also repeatedly asked the military to give it some territory. The Japanese military, with great generosity, allowed the customs to collect "Hua Xing Coupons." However, the Chinese still pay in legal tender, and the "Renovation" side is afraid that merchants will pay taxes in "Hua Yu Coupons" and affect their "finances," so they also welcome legal tender. However, when paying taxes, they first convert it into customs gold units according to the market price of "Hua Xing Coupons," with the purpose of implementing a disguised tax increase. The fate of the "Third Type of Paper," at best, can only inherit this legacy of "Hua Xing Coupons"!</p>
<p>The Future of Foreign Exchange and Countermeasures</p>
<p>Xi Qiao　Professor Liu, you are eating vegetables alone, that won't do. I want to ask you, what will happen to foreign exchange?</p>
<p>An Lun　It's just creating an opportunity for speculative friends.</p>
<p>Jian Xiang　Two major events before Christmas had a significant impact. Sterling quickly soared from five thousand six or seven hundred yuan to six thousand six or seven hundred yuan; the US dollar shrank from more than five yuan eight corners to around five yuan three corners at once. Prices of all goods have started to rise, and everyone is very panicked.</p>
<p>An Lun　What everyone is panicking about is not what great tricks the "Third Type of Paper" will play; what they are worried about is the National Government's counter-offensive strategy. HSBC's low quotations have made people even more frightened. In fact, the purpose of the National Government's counter-offensive, regardless of the strategy it adopts, is to strengthen the position of legal tender. People in the market originally knew this. They also know that there is no problem with legal tender. It's really contradictory!</p>
<p>Jian Xiang</p>
<p>They are all fishing in troubled waters; there is no contradiction at all.</p>
<p>An Lun　Isn't it contradictory to let the fish go and then catch it? It's easy to let go but difficult to catch; foreign exchange has been increasing in recent months; the withdrawal of American expatriates and the imminent Pacific War have made foreign exchange bulls panic. Why are speculators so forgetful? The current international situation is more tense than before, the uses of foreign exchange are narrower than before, and the foundation of legal tender is even more solid after the establishment of new loans from the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. They seem to have forgotten all these ironclad facts!</p>
<p>Xi Qiao　That's right, who can guarantee that the peace of the Pacific can last a few more days? By then, foreign exchange can only be admired like a stamp. The fate of Shanghai is also uncertain, and no insurance company will insure goods against being confiscated.</p>
<p>Jian Xiang　What should we do then?</p>
<p>Shao Qiu　What are you worried about? (Laughter) This kind of thing is not worth paying attention to; even if we have to pay attention to it, I believe the country has already made preparations. Moreover, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are by no means fools; when lending money to China, they will definitely think about being speculated on.</p>
<p>Jian Xiang　What everyone is worried about is that the government will abandon maintaining the Shanghai foreign exchange market again. If the supply stops, the exchange rate will inevitably shrink again</p>
<p>Xi Qiao　So foreign exchange shrinks and prices rise. Isn't that just making trouble for yourself?</p>
<p>Jian Xiang　If you don't stop supplying foreign exchange, you can't prevent others from speculating. If you want to reduce the possibility of others speculating on foreign exchange, you can only let the exchange rate fall further. Speculators have no conscience to speak of. As long as there is money to be made, sacrificing national interests is nothing to them. Even businessmen, predicting that the exchange rate will shrink and prices will rise, must prepare in advance; you can't say that they are making trouble for themselves.</p>
<p>Xi Qiao　Speculating on foreign exchange requires preparing a large amount of legal tender; it has no way to circulate, how much legal tender can it get?</p>
<p>Jian Xiang　If he comes to speculate, what can we do?</p>
<p>An Lun　We really don't know what to do; and it is not appropriate to speculate. However, in fact, there are all kinds of ways to deal with it. Leaving aside other things, let me just give one example: why can the black market for sterling in the New York market be eliminated? As long as we obtain the cooperation of those with power in the international exchange market, we can prevent the depletion of foreign exchange resources on the one hand, and still keep the exchange market stable on the other.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange black market arose after China implemented exchange control policies. Because at that time, the cooperation of British and American banks was not obtained, not only did they not cooperate, but they also publicly announced the termination of the gentleman's agreement they had concluded in the past. If British and American banks had cooperated with China's exchange policy at that time, the black market would never have arisen; even if it did, it would never have shrunk to this point today.</p>
<p>Jian Xiang　Can we cooperate now?</p>
<p>An Lun　No one can predict how the country will deal with the "Third Type of Paper." This is just my personal guess. Comparing the international situation now with the past, I think it is very possible to obtain this kind of cooperation.</p>
<p>When China implemented the legal tender system, everyone knew that it was linked to sterling. Therefore, the US dollar and legal tender were only opponents in exchange, not companions in exchange. When China implemented exchange control, Britain, under Chamberlain's appeasement policy, was unwilling to bind its diplomatic freedom with a monetary alliance against Japan; even after the establishment of the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund, it only aimed at stabilizing the open exchange market and did not actively assist the control policy. Failure to actively strengthen exchange control and actively crack down on exchange speculation, only starting from stabilizing the open exchange market, naturally could not prevent exchange speculation. If we want to reduce exchange speculation, we can only use a bitter trick and let the exchange rate fall. If we strengthen exchange control, there is no need to maintain the exchange market, and the exchange market will not move slightly. Stabilizing the exchange market without distinction is really not a very sound method. However, China's exchange control, if it does not obtain the cooperation of friendly countries, then it can be said to be impossible in Shanghai, where international relations are complex, especially in Shanghai, which is generally a quasi-occupied area.</p>
<p>The international situation is now much better than the past attitude of Britain and the United States towards the Far East. They have fully understood that China's victory and the interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East are inseparable. Britain and the United States inevitably had some competition over China's monetary policy in the past. This is also one of the reasons why China's exchange control failed to obtain international unity. China and the United States are cooperating in all aspects, and their interests in the Far East are even more consistent. The only area that was less cooperative in the past was monetary policy. Because China's legal tender policy was not consistent with the purpose of the United States' implementation of the silver movement. Although the United States did not give the legal tender policy active cooperation, it still gave friendly assistance, such as the signing of the Sino-US Silver Agreement and so on. However, the monetary relationship between China and the United States did not enter an alliance period until the United States lent China one hundred million yuan, and only lingered on friendly assistance. However, this loan unprecedentedly declared that it would be used to assist China's legal tender. This is unprecedented. It can be seen that the monetary relationship between China and the United States, which was the only one that did not enter the stage of cooperation, has now laid the foundation for an alliance. Then the problem is much simpler when China needs to strengthen exchange control.</p>
<p>After the supply of foreign exchange is managed, the legitimate commercial needs are fully supplied, and speculative activities and speculative attempts have nowhere to use their tricks. At that time, the black market for legal tender in Shanghai will be like the black market for sterling in New York, which can be eliminated very quickly; and the exchange rate will inevitably stabilize at an appropriate level from then on.</p>
<p>What Offensive Does the "Third Type of Paper" Have?</p>
<p>Jian Xiang　But there are always some dangers in Shanghai. Will the Jiangning side copy the "Federal Reserve Note" policy of forced exchange to gradually seize the legal tender in everyone's hands?</p>
<p>An Lun　Of course, there is this possibility, but when there is this possibility, it is not just the legal tender in everyone's hands, but also the goods, gold, foreign exchange, and even lives that you hoard, none of which may be confiscated. But this depends on the fate of Shanghai. But what power does it have to determine the fate of Shanghai?</p>
<p>Shao Qiu　Shanghai's wealth lies in commerce. Destroying Shanghai's security is a foolish act of killing the goose to get the eggs.</p>
<p>Qiu Wei　The third type of paper, like others, ultimately aims to destroy legal tender. But legal tender will not suffer the slightest damage. The people of Jiangning also know this; therefore, its issuance still copies the old method of the failed "Hua Xing Coupons" being "linked at par" with legal tender. If China wants to deal with it, there will be a difference between the past and the present. In the past, we defeated "Hua Xing" with a bitter trick because the foreign exchange level was still high at that time; now, there is no need to do so. I think Professor Liu's observations are very likely.</p>
<p>Jian Xiang　Will the "Third Type of Paper" sneak into the Shanghai Concession?</p>
<p>Shao Qiu　Have "Hua Xing Coupons" and military scrip ever sneaked in? Have you ever seen them in the market? Its only use is to buy train tickets. In addition, it can't even buy a pack of matches; those with a national concept will naturally not accept it; those without a national concept will not accept it for the same reason because they especially love money. If you have this kind of paper money by your side, do you have the face to show it to others? In short, it cannot destroy legal tender, but it hinders its ability to extract social wealth; as for relieving its own financial difficulties, it is nothing more than a pie in the sky. When considering practical benefits, it may also find that a single move is worse than remaining still?</p>

<h3>Financial Commentary</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>——December 28th——</p>
<p>China's Deed Tax</p>
<p>On the 18th of this month, the National Government promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Deed Tax," consisting of seventeen articles, which came into effect on the date of promulgation. It stipulates that in areas where the future Land Law and Land Tax are implemented, the transferee of real estate, whether through mortgage or sale, must obtain a deed and pay the deed tax. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Deed Content: Divided into three copies: a stub, a copy for verification, and the deed itself, each with a unique number on the perforation. It should clearly state the type of land, the boundaries, location, and area, the number of rooms in the house, the sale or mortgage price, the date of agreement, the parties to the deed, the names of the witnesses, and other necessary information.</p>
<p>Deed Format: To be determined by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Deed Fee: Fifty cents in national currency per deed.</p>
<p>Deed Tax Rate: (1) 5% of the sale price for a sale deed; (2) 3% of the mortgage price for a mortgage deed. If a property is first mortgaged and then sold, the original deed tax paid for the mortgage can be used to offset the sale deed tax, but only if the mortgagee and the buyer are the same person with the same name.</p>
<p>Tax Payment Period: The transferee must pay the deed tax within four months of the contract's establishment.</p>
<p>Various Penalties: (1) Penalty for late payment: If the tax is not paid within four months of the deed's establishment, in addition to being ordered to pay the tax, a fine of 10% of the tax payable will be imposed. For every two months of further delay, an additional 10% will be added until the total fine reaches the full amount of the tax payable. However, if the deed tax cannot be paid on time due to force majeure within the prescribed tax payment period, a statement of reasons can be made, and if verified to be true, the penalty will be waived.</p>
<p>(2) Penalty for concealing the deed price: If the sale price or mortgage price is concealed, in addition to being ordered to replace the deed, truthfully correct the information, and pay the tax due, if the understated sale price is below 20%, a penalty of half the amount of the underpaid tax will be imposed; if it is between 20% and 50%, a penalty of the full amount of the underpaid tax will be imposed; if it is above 50%, a penalty of twice the amount of the underpaid tax will be imposed.</p>
<p>(3) Penalty for not using a deed: If a deed is not obtained and used in accordance with the law, in addition to being ordered to pay the deed fee and obtain a deed, a fine of one to five yuan will be imposed.</p>
<p>Deed tax is a type of tax levied on the certificate established when the ownership of real estate such as land and houses is transferred through sale or purchase. The certificate must be submitted for inspection and registration in order to determine and guarantee the ownership, hence the tax payment. Deed tax is only collected when real estate is transferred, so it is a temporary opportunity tax. In financial terms, it is a type of registration tax within circulation taxes.</p>
<p>China's deed tax developed very early. In the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty (1647), it was stipulated that for every tael of silver paid for land and house transactions, a tax of three fen was levied. From the 16th year of Kangxi (1677) to the 21st year, deed taxes were successively established in provinces such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Jiangxi. In the 7th year of Yongzheng (1729), it was approved to add one li to the three fen per tael of deed tax to be used as funding for the examination halls. The subsequent development is yet to be examined. In the third year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Deed Tax Regulations" and the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Deed Tax Regulations," and there were also revised "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Deed Tax Regulations." In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance approved the issuance of detailed rules for deed forms. In the fifth year, special zone deed tax regulations were announced. These regulations have been adopted by various provinces to this day. Although some provinces have their own deed tax regulations, they are generally the same in principle. According to the regulations, the buyer or mortgagee of real estate must, within six months of the establishment of the deed, bring it to the relevant tax authority for inspection and registration. Deed forms are issued by the county governments, or the contract text is written on officially sold deed forms, or affixed to official deeds. The fee for deed forms ranges from several cents to one or two yuan per form. At the time of inspection, a deed tax must be paid: the sale deed tax is nine percent of the deed price, and the mortgage deed tax is six percent of the deed price. If the property is first mortgaged and then sold, the original deed tax paid for the mortgage can be used to offset the sale deed tax, but only if the mortgagee and the buyer are the same person.</p>
<p>Although the content of the "Provisional Regulations on Deed Tax" promulgated this time is not significantly different from the past, there are slight differences in terms of tax rates, deed forms, and tax payment when compared with the aforementioned regulations. In terms of tax rates, the sale deed tax is reduced from nine percent to five percent, and the mortgage deed tax is reduced from six percent to three percent. In terms of deed forms, the fee is set at fifty cents. In terms of the tax payment period, it is reduced from six months to four months. Although the tax rates are reduced, the tax collection techniques have been tightened. This is because excessively high tax rates easily lead to tax evasion and underreporting of sale prices to reduce the tax payable. Now that the tax rates are lower and heavy penalties are imposed on tax evasion and underreporting, transferees are more likely to be willing to pay taxes to quickly establish ownership and gain protection.</p>
<p>The income from deed tax was originally collected by the various counties and remitted to the central government. However, during the Beijing government era, the provinces often retained it. Therefore, in the second year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance drafted a "Draft Law on National Taxes and Local Taxes," which classified deed tax as a central government tax. However, due to practical difficulties, it was never implemented. After the establishment of the National Government, it was determined to reorganize the tax system. In November of the 11th year, the "Standards for the Division of National and Local Revenue" were promulgated, based on the spirit of balanced power between the central and local governments. Because deed tax was related to land tax, it was reassigned to the provincial governments as a major source of revenue for the provincial governments. Later, in November of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the "Standards for Handling Budget Revenue and Expenditure Classification" were promulgated, which still classified deed tax as a local tax. In the "Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law" promulgated in July of the 24th year, it was stipulated as a tax of the county or city subordinate to the province, but it was not called deed tax, but rather property tax, and it was stipulated that it would be merged into the land improvement tax after the Land Law was implemented. Although the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law has been expressly ordered by the National Government to be temporarily suspended during the extraordinary period, the "Provisional Regulations on Deed Tax" promulgated this time still carry out this approach, stipulating that the deed tax is collected by the county and municipal governments.</p>
<h3>Bank Closing Tomorrow</h3>
<p>An additional exchange has been added. The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee has decided to add an exchange for year-end closing. A circular has been sent to each exchange bank stipulating that in addition to the existing exchange at 3:15 PM, a second exchange will be held at 4:45 PM. The handling of collection receipts will remain the same.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight rebound in tightness. The guild quoted prices as follows: Spot No. 24 coarse white foreign warehouse old goods arriving in September were 78.5 yuan, July were 78.1 yuan, and mid-January orders were 79.5 yuan, all with a good recovery. Spot Dutch red sugar was 64.1 to 64.2 yuan, up 0.2 yuan, and mid-January delivery was 64.5 yuan. Taikoo car white B mark West Warehouse was 78.5 to 78.1 yuan, opening day orders were 78 yuan, DY mark West Warehouse new goods were 76.5 yuan, old goods were 75.8 yuan, and HY mark West Warehouse new goods were 76.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Codonopsis pilosula Suddenly Surges 20 Yuan Due to Depletion</h3>
<p>Recently, due to frequent purchases by various gangs, the market for Codonopsis pilosula has been feeling increasingly depleted. For example, the price of Zhoushan goods, which was previously sold for 145 yuan, now requires 165 yuan. Ningbo goods have also risen to 125 yuan, a 20 yuan increase compared to the previous period. If the source is not replenished, further increases should be prevented.</p>

<h3>Exciting News at Year-End: American Air Force Volunteers Arrive in China, Coolidge Ship Has Already Carried Some People to the Philippines, Several More Batches Will Arrive in the Far East in Succession</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the United States, in order to cope with the international situation, has ordered and encouraged overseas Chinese in the Far East to evacuate. Special postal ships, such as the Monterey, have been dispatched to carry overseas Chinese back to the country, as reported in previous newspapers. Now, the evacuation of overseas Chinese is considered to have come to an end.</p>
<p>Sympathizing with China, Voluntarily Joining</p>
<p>However, there are still quite a few Americans residing in the Far East. In the future, when necessary, the US government will continue to send ships to evacuate them. It is reported that the Coolidge President, a US presidential liner, is coming from the US to the Far East. Because 500 American volunteer air force pilots sympathize with China and are willing to serve in China, part of them have already arrived at the Philippines on the ship. Therefore, the ship sailed directly to Little Luzon. It is reported that this is the first batch, and there are four more batches waiting for the opportunity to come to China.</p>
<p>Original Ship to Shanghai, Returns to US on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Now that the ship's mission is complete, it has departed from Little Luzon and come to Shanghai via Hong Kong. It is scheduled to arrive at Wharf Nos. 11 and 12 at 2:30 PM today. Passengers will transfer to small launches at 3:30 PM and dock at the Customs Pier. The postal ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 2:00 AM on the first day of the month to return to the US. The last launch for passengers will depart from the Customs Pier at 1:00 AM on the first day of the month. At that time, the curfew will be in effect, making movement on the road inconvenient. Therefore, there will be a launch departing from the Customs Pier at 9:00 PM on the 31st (evening). The passenger cabins on the ship returning to the US have already been fully booked.</p>
<p>Two Hundred Missionaries Ordered to Return Home</p>
<p>More than two hundred American missionaries and their wives in China have decided to return to the country on the Coolidge ship. Most of them are members of the Presbyterian Church. When the State Department ordered the evacuation of overseas Chinese, the missionaries in China expressed a firm attitude to strictly adhere to their positions. Even if the situation was extremely urgent, they would rather go to the Chinese interior than return to the US. Later, the General Assembly of the American Church specially sent Bishop Roberts to Shanghai to preside over and supervise the evacuation of the missionaries. He explained the importance of the overall situation and urged the missionaries that if there was no need to stay in China, it would be better to support the national policy and return to the country as soon as possible. The evacuation of more than two hundred people this time is due to this reason.</p>
<p>Reissuing Evacuation Orders Next Spring</p>
<p>In addition to the Coolidge President, there will be two other ships, the President Pierce and the President Taft, departing from Shanghai for the US around the 6th and 20th of next month. All second and third-class cabins have been almost fully booked, but there are quite a few remaining first-class cabins. Another batch of more than one hundred missionaries will leave China on these two ships. However, ordinary overseas Chinese are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. It is generally believed that the US State Department may issue another order in March next year urging overseas Chinese in the Far East to return to the country. At that time, the situation may be very different from now.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchant Murdered a Year Ago, Still Framing People</h3>
<p>Arresting Zhang Wengda, Insisting He Was the Murderer</p>
<p>Nagata Toraji, a Japanese merchant selling goods at No. 6 Dekang Lane, Qiujiang Road, is fifty years old. He travels between Suzhou and Changzhou from time to time. On October 15th last year, he took a car with a Korean, Jiang Biwen, thirty years old, to Changzhou. They then took a rickshaw to Shiru Field outside the West Gate of Changzhou, where they were shot by guerrillas with a handgun. Nagata was shot in the head, chest, and abdomen in three vital areas and died on the spot. Jiang was only shot in the neck, but was seriously injured. Unexpectedly, a year later, the Japanese military police arrested a person in Changzhou and accused him of being the murderer. According to the Japanese newspaper, he was originally a special operations team member of the Changbei Brigade in Wujin County, named Zhang Xinda, twenty-four years old. He had recruited soldiers or collected information for the guerrillas.</p>
<h3>Three People Allegedly Arrested After Miyazaki's Assassination</h3>
<p>After Miyazaki Satoshi, a police officer at the Japanese Consulate, was stabbed to death with a sharp knife on Zhonghua Road, Wenmiao Road in the Nanshi district late at night on the 20th of this month, according to Japanese newspaper reports, three Chinese people have been arrested. One is He Guoyao, twenty-five years old, who was arrested at the Lvbao gambling den on Luxiangyuan Road. The others are Xu Atang, twenty-five years old, and Cai Qingyuan, thirty years old, who were arrested while loitering in front of the Tongqing Hotel on Tongqing Street.</p>
<h3>Two Men of a Certain Nationality Attempted Kidnapping, Each Found with a Handgun, to Be Transferred After Investigation</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the Central Police Station of the French Concession dispatched a Chinese, Western, and Vietnamese patrol team. At around 7:00 AM, while patrolling on Avenue Joffre, they saw two men of a certain nationality who looked suspicious. They immediately searched them and found a handgun on each of the two men. They were all taken back to the police station for interrogation. It is said that the two men were planning to kidnap a certain Chinese person. After a thorough investigation, they will be handed over to the relevant consulate for review.</p>
<h3>Dr. Baker Departing for Hong Kong, Expected to Arrive in Shanghai in Mid-January</h3>
<p>Dr. Baker, General Secretary of the American Red Cross, departed from Hong Kong for Guilin on the 12th of this month, and then went to Chongqing, Guiyang, and other places to inspect the lives of the people in Free China and distribute medicines. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, Dr. Baker has scheduled to depart for Hong Kong via Shaoguan today after completing his official duties. After spending the New Year in Hong Kong, he is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-January. In addition, the export procedures for rice and wheat from the American Red Cross to aid refugees in the occupied areas of Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, etc. have been completed and are already being shipped. They are expected to arrive and be distributed soon.</p>
<h3>Gaussmuth to Arrive in Shanghai on New Year's Day, Plans to Transfer to Tianjin and Then to Beiping</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China Gaussmuth, after arriving in Chongqing, immediately paid visits to the central authorities. Now that he has completed his official duties, he left Chongqing on the 28th with his entourage Dairel. He will take a plane to Shanghai via Hong Kong. According to the itinerary, he is expected to arrive in Shanghai on New Year's Day. He will stay in Shanghai for a short time and then plan to take a ship to Tianjin and then to Beiping to visit his wife and children who are currently living in Beiping. British Ambassador Kerr was originally planning to return to Shanghai before Christmas to visit his wife, but this was cancelled due to the increasingly close diplomatic relations between China and Britain. In addition, American Ambassador Johnson and Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin also decided to stay in the capital to celebrate the New Year and maintain close contact with the Chinese government, as various countries' aid to China has become more active.</p>
<h3>Guangci Hospital Employees Request Salary Increase</h3>
<p>Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road is established by the French Municipal Council. All employees in the hospital, totaling more than 150 people, have requested the hospital to improve their treatment due to the soaring prices and the increasing difficulty of life. Therefore, yesterday, they publicly elected seventeen representatives, including Jin Kuansheng, to petition the hospital director and put forward eight conditions as follows: 1.

<h3>Private Parcels from the Occupied Areas Allowed to Be Exempted from Import Licenses</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance telegraphed the following: "It has been verified that for prohibited import items sent by parcel post from the occupied areas to private individuals, if the value is less than five customs gold units and there is no suspicion of commercial activity, import will be allowed. The customs shall verify the tax payment and inspect the goods, and no import permit is required."</p>
<h3>After the British Merchant Yongfeng Ship Imported, It Was Detained for Inspection</h3>
<p>The British merchant Yongfeng ship of the Moller Company was sailing from Fuzhou, Minhai Port, back to Shanghai on the 24th of this month. When it was outside the port, it encountered a Japanese warship that attempted to board the ship for inspection. However, because the ship was sailing very fast, it was unable to stop it. The Japanese warship then telegraphed the Shanghai-based navy to report. When the ship sailed into the Wusongkou on the 27th, it was detained by the Japanese navy at the Astronomical Observatory Wharf, and personnel were sent to board the ship for inspection. However, the ship was only carrying fruits and had no other prohibited items. The ship was released yesterday morning, but it had been detained for two days.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow is the End of the National Calendar Year, the Financial Situation is Stable, the Scope of Speculation is Narrow, the Money Market is Ample, Silver and Money Industries will Open on the Fourth</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China, and the silver and money industries are handling the final accounts. The banks have completed the interest settlement for savings, commerce, and other departments. The money houses have rushed to handle the annual settlement and will all be closed for three days from New Year's Day, opening for business on the fourth. Shanghai's overall finances remain as stable as ever. The low interest rates on money houses prove that the money market is ample, and all industries have passed through peacefully. Compared with the last period, the current financial state seems more stable. The notable aspects are as follows:</p>
<p>Return of Floating Capital</p>
<p>Since the extension of the war, the outflow of funds has been inevitable. However, since the expansion of the European war in May of this year, the state of currencies in the European belligerent countries has changed. The Axis powers announced the pact, the United States actively reorganized its army, and the situation in the Pacific gradually presented a turbulent and uneasy image. Funds that used to flow to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia have poured into this port in large quantities, and the money market has become very loose. Exchange remittance fees have dropped to below two yuan, almost disappearing.</p>
<p>Lower Interest Rates</p>
<p>With the easing of the money market, interest rates naturally decrease. During this period, commercial banks generally reduced the interest rate on demand deposits by one li. The Joint Reserve Treasury of Shanghai's silver and money industry uniformly reduced interest rates for its member banks and money houses. After the commercial banks successively reduced interest rates, depositors did not make large withdrawals, and the market showed a stable but loose appearance. The four national banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank, and the Communications Bank, did not reduce interest rates.</p>
<p>Rising Public Bonds</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance declared its determination to maintain creditworthiness, the national consolidated bonds of the 25th year of the Republic of China successively rose to new highs not seen since the August 13th Incident. Not only did domestic bonds rise, but foreign bonds also rose. In the London market, various Chinese foreign bonds rose by one and a half to five pounds each. For example, the Rehabilitation Public Bonds once fell to 18 pounds in October, but now have risen to 34 pounds. As for the principal and interest of domestic bonds, they are allocated and paid on time in designated funds and have never been delinquent.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Fund</p>
<p>Since the completion of the US loan to China of 100 million US dollars, of which 50 million US dollars were used to stabilize the legal tender for Sino-US financial cooperation, followed by a British loan of 10 million pounds. Remembering that since the "May 2nd Incident," the British government stated that it needed US cooperation to maintain Chinese legal tender, this can now be realized. The foundation for foreign exchange has been laid, and confidence in the legal tender has been strengthened. However, the regulations for the method of use are still awaiting agreement between the two countries.</p>
<p>Speculative Fear</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial commodity market has not been prohibited from speculative activities due to the temporary lack of authority of the Chinese government. However, compared to the past, its scope has narrowed. Due to changes in international relations, operators of foreign currency and foreign stocks have become wary after the "May 2nd Incident." The black market for foreign exchange has been stabilized under the maintenance of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee. Speculators in various markets are quieter compared to the last period.</p>
<h3>The Three Countries Cooperate in Textile Exchange to Cope With Abundant Resources, Song Ziwen Discusses With British and American Authorities to Support the Smooth Operation of the Exchange Market</h3>
<p>Regarding stabilizing the exchange rate of legal tender and preventing exchange arbitrage, China, Britain, and the United States will take cooperative measures on a technical level. This news was revealed by British economic circles in this port. The London telecommunication news yesterday reported that Song Ziwen, chairman of the Bank of China, British Minister of Finance Phillips, and the American authorities are discussing in Washington ways to jointly support exchange rates and are progressing very smoothly. This mutually confirms that there is no doubt that China, Britain, and the United States are cooperating on financial technology to maintain common interests. According to inquiries from banking circles, British and American banks in Shanghai have deeply rooted influence, and Shanghai is the center of the Chinese economy. China has the cooperation of British and American authorities in Shanghai and more exchange funds. The situation caused by the issuance of unapproved banknotes can be adequately dealt with. Recently, the black market exchange rate has gradually eased. After the new year, it will not be difficult to maintain the original state.</p>
<h3>The Cooperative Association Strives to Promote the Establishment of Small Amount Rice Purchases Yesterday, Elected Staff, a Large Amount of Foreign Rice Will Arrive Next Spring</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Food Cooperative Association has been preparing for more than a month to promote the purchase of small amounts of rice by groups, and it has been fully prepared and formally established a few days ago, and began purchasing. The association held an inaugural meeting yesterday and elected ten supervisors, including Xi Yushu, Gui Yanfang, Hu Mingshan, Chen Lianzhang, Sun Ruihuang, Yang Bogeng, Yuan Hesong, Li Zulai, Wang Huanzhang, Ding Xuenong, and Cui Fuzhuang. Fifteen directors were elected, including Pei Yunqing, Chen Panjun, Yan Esheng, Yin Zibai, Xu Zhiyi, Zhang Wenkui, Chen Yisheng, Jin Zhixuan, Qian Qiling, Zhang Jusheng, Lu Xiuyuan, Lv Tieying, Ai Zhongquan, Hu Xuantong, and Dong Guoqing, to be responsible for overall management. All the revised regulations for purchasing rice on behalf of others will be officially announced within days.</p>
<p>Motives for Launching</p>
<p>An official of the association stated that the people's food situation will become more and more serious if this continues. We cannot bear to sit idly by and therefore, without fear of hardship, initiated the organization of this association and decided to fully promote the purchase of small amounts of rice by groups. Small-amount regular households purchasing one to five bags of rice can be given preferential treatment. The association plans to raise a huge amount of cash from enthusiastic people in the community and will prepay the funds on their behalf. Therefore, at the time of ordering, only half of the payment needs to be collected, and the full amount must be paid when the rice arrives. The Federation of Silver and Money Industries and the Yiyou Society have been entrusted to handle the matters on our behalf. In short, the association's motives are all for serving the community and stabilizing the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Rice Arriving Next Spring</p>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai rice industry yesterday, the Norwegian "Merchant" ship was delayed until 8:00 AM this morning, berthing at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong. The ship is loaded with 50,000 bags of Saigon foreign rice. Most of the rice is No. 2 rice. It is said that it was ordered by foreign firms such as Heyi, so the number of spot codes in the rice market will inevitably increase, and the market situation will become more stable. According to another source, around January 15th of the new year, 150,000 bags of foreign rice may arrive in port, and a large batch of Yangon foreign rice, about 200,000 bags, was loaded onto ships at the Yangon production area a few days ago. It can be transported to Shanghai at the end of January or early February. Therefore, rice prices will inevitably fall sharply at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Han Zhengping Talks</p>
<p>Rice prices in the city are rising day by day, and price limits have been violated. The authorities have difficulty suppressing this, and the lives of ordinary people are becoming more difficult. According to Han Zhengping, Shanghai is originally an industrial and commercial area, and the city's food has always relied on imports from other ports. The transit was extremely convenient. The suburbs are under control, and foreign exchange is shrinking day by day, resulting in the monopoly of hoarders. Fortunately, the authorities caught up quickly, and the trend of grabbing rice spread. However, due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange and rising gold prices, the rice market secretly offered price cuts and secret transactions, which violated the price limits, which is very regrettable. It is verified that there is actually no lack of rice in the city. According to the Jianghai Customs Report, the import of foreign rice this year has reached 3.6 million dan. In addition to what has been consumed in the past eleven months, there are still 1.3 million bags of rice. This is only in terms of the amount of foreign rice that has been imported this year. Therefore, if the rice merchants in the city can all abide by the law and not be greedy, the secret price increase trend will naturally be suppressed.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Fellow Townsmen's Fundraising Conference Raised 130,000 on the Spot</h3>
<p>The Zhenhai Shanghai Fellow Townsmen's Association convened a disaster relief fundraising conference on the afternoon of the 28th (previous day) at 2:00 PM. More than 100 people attended and discussed fundraising methods. The following was decided: (1) widely hire fundraising committee members; (2) widely publicize to encourage universal fundraising; (3) this donation is not limited to fellow townsmen and can be solicited from enthusiastic people from all walks of life; (4) cable the Zhenhai County Governor to do their best to earnestly comfort the famine situation and not allow it to expand; (5) set January 15th as the first donation period. Please ask all fundraising committee members to raise 500,000 yuan before the deadline and remit it to Zhenhai in advance, and decide to hold another conference on that day. Then, donations were made on the spot, and the donations were very enthusiastic, totaling 131,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Association for the Relief of Women and Children Broadcasts a Promotional Campaign</h3>
<p>The China Association for the Relief of Women and Children has been experiencing increasing difficulties in maintaining its operations due to the reduction in donations from the authorities of the two concessions and from all walks of life in recent years, coupled with high prices. Now, the association is taking advantage of the 30th anniversary of its establishment to hold a fundraising and promotional campaign. It has been decided to broadcast fundraising for three days starting the day after tomorrow (New Year's Day), to appeal to all walks of life. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Key Officials: The key officials for the association's 30th anniversary fundraising campaign are: Honorary Chairman Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lantao, Yuan Lvdeng, Xu Jilong, Zhao Jinqing, and Zhu Zikui; Chairman Xu Qianlin; Chairman of the Committee Qiu Kanghou; Vice-Chairman of the Committee Xu Xiaochu and Xu Guanqun; General Manager Ge Futian and Zhu Yutao; Secretary Zhu Yan Kuasheng; Finance Director Li Wenjie and Huang Yuzhai; General Affairs Director Huang Yantang and Zhang Yizhai.</p>
<p>Promotional Work: In order to encourage people from all walks of life to donate enthusiastically, the association has printed many kinds of slogans. The wooden city public bus and tram companies and major hotels, restaurants, companies, and merchants have all agreed to post them. A poster was also produced, depicting the tragic scenes of abducted and lost women and children, with the words "Separation of Flesh and Blood, Heart is Like a Knife, Quickly Donate Money, Merit is Immeasurable" at the bottom, which is a warning and eye-catching. The association has asked major cinemas in the city to insert this promotional item before the screening of the main film and will publish a special issue commemorating the 30th anniversary of its establishment on New Year's Day to promote widely.</p>
<p>Broadcast Programs: The association's broadcast programs are scheduled as follows: (New Year's Day) Dahua Shaoxing Opera, new standard famous tickets, famous actors, Huaying storytelling, (2nd day) Xinxin Minghua, Huatai acrobatics, Yakai vaudeville (3rd day) Xinxin Women's Yue Opera, Sino-American Shen Opera, Tianchan Siming Speaking Volumes, Daxin Rebroadcast,</p>
<h3>Tushanwan Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tushanwan in Xujiahui, west of Shanghai, is an important route to Songqing and Shanghai-Hangzhou. Hundreds of pedicabs and vendors transporting cigarettes, cloth, and kerosene pass through daily. Previously, the area was closed by the Japanese, who used barbed wire to seal off the front of the former Catholic Church Defense Corps site, prohibiting vehicles from passing and conducting thorough searches, causing difficulties for nearby factories transporting goods. After the 19th, work was suspended, but it is now known that it suddenly reopened yesterday.</p>

<h3>Japanese Actively Competing for Seats on the Board of Directors; British and Americans Cannot Ignore Their Base. According to the Land Regulations, the British and Americans Are Not Falling Behind. The Japanese Are Attempting to Reform the Electoral System to Secure Victory.</h3>
<p>Although the election for the next term of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Board of Directors is still more than three months away, the Japanese, learning from their defeat in the previous election, are carefully and actively preparing for the next election. Taking the Japanese Residents' Association as its mainstay, it is implementing all plans that are conducive to the election. It is also launching a counter-offensive campaign against the British and American League. When the reporter from the Pingming News Agency inquired with various relevant parties in the Shanghai Municipal Council about this issue, no one expressed optimism about the next election. Some even stated that it was difficult to predict who would win or lose in the next election.</p>
<p>Japanese Attempt to Change the Electoral System</p>
<p>The Board of Directors Election Committee organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council is composed of foreign taxpayer representatives from various countries, including Britain, America, Germany, Russia, and Japan. Its main purpose is to handle the procedures for the Board of Directors election. It is one of the subcommittees of the Shanghai Municipal Council and has already held six meetings. In the most recent decision, last Tuesday, the Japanese representatives proposed an important motion, attempting to overturn the current electoral system and make a thorough reform, with the number of seats on the Board of Directors being determined by the population size. The committee believes that it does not have the authority to change the Land Regulations of the Foreign Concessions, leading to a deadlock. The meeting was originally scheduled to end after the sixth decision, but now its date must be extended again.</p>
<p>British and American Assets Are of Significant Value</p>
<p>As for the British and American fronts and the number of votes for the Japanese in the next election, both sides have now begun taking steps and methods to win votes. To increase the number of votes, the Japanese are dividing their taxpayers who own large amounts of real estate or have excessive tax obligations among non-real Japanese residents without tax obligations, and are doing everything possible to increase the number of Japanese votes. As for the British and American residents, their real estate in the Public Concession is far greater than that of the Japanese, and the taxes they pay to the Shanghai Municipal Council are also more than those paid by the Japanese. According to the Land Regulations, the British and Americans should not be disappointed in the next election. However, since the European War, a large number of American residents have been summoned to leave Shanghai and return home. In addition, the American residents are gradually withdrawing, which has inevitably slightly affected the votes of the British and American residents.</p>
<h3>Savings Association Holds New Year Savings Promotion; Concession Residents Who Want to Purchase Savings Certificates Can Entrust Banks to Purchase on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>Since the launch of the National Savings for National Construction movement, it has been extremely smooth, and the results in various places have exceeded the predetermined savings amount. Now, the General Association has launched a New Year savings promotion movement, stipulating that from New Year's Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China, all parts of the country have been ordered to comply. The Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, as well as banks in various provinces and cities, have recently issued National Savings for National Construction Certificates. Due to the special environment in the Shanghai Concession area, the banks have not issued savings certificates, but residents who want to purchase savings certificates can entrust banks to purchase them on their behalf from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Ordinary Alert for Three Days Starting on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions in this city have recently intensified security in the territory in order to maintain good public order as the end of the year approaches. The enforcement of the curfew in the Public Concession has been stricter than before in recent days. The police and patrol officers inspected and repaired the barbed wire and other roadblocks set up on various roads and non-essential lanes. In addition, the two concessions will take ordinary alert for three days on New Year's Day (Wednesday) in the 30th year of the Republic of China. In addition to increasing the number of police officers and patrol cars, the roads on the borders will remain open as usual and will not be closed.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Undelivered Parcels in Haiphong to Be Shipped This Year</h3>
<p>Regarding the large and small parcels sent from Shanghai to various provinces and cities in the Southwest, due to the impact of the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the parcels that had been received could not be delivered and were mostly stored in the warehouse of the Haiphong Post Office, totaling 20,000 to 30,000 items. Most of these parcels were sent to Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Kunming, and other places, and two-thirds were daily necessities. Although the Haiphong Post Office had taken good care of them, the items were stored for too long and in large quantities, inevitably being exposed to moisture, resulting in a small number of parcels being damaged by moisture. Since the Burma Road was officially opened, the Post Office immediately negotiated with the authorities to send special postal vehicles to transport the large number of undelivered parcels from Haiphong. The Parcel Business Section of the Shanghai Postal Administration learned that these parcels would be shipped in full this year. Fortunately, due to the careful storage, there were only a small number of items that were rotten or damaged. Once all of these parcels have been shipped, the Shanghai Post Office will be able to resume receiving large and small parcels from various provinces and cities in the Southwest. It is expected that there will be a crowd of people delivering these parcels at that time. In order to avoid any impact at that time, the procedures for delivering these parcels will be changed, or registration will be done first, so that the procedures can be avoided when receiving and sending them.</p>
<h3>Gunshots Fired at Huasheng Gambling Den</h3>
<p>At 9:45 p.m. the night before last, someone suddenly fired three gunshots in the open space behind the Huasheng Gambling Den on Haig Road in Xujiahui, west of Shanghai. The employees of the gambling den, hearing this, mistook it for a robbery and turned on the alarm light. The alarm bell rang loudly, and the iron gates outside were immediately closed. The male and female gamblers were panicked. Later, a large number of armed police officers were dispatched from the Jiaotong University Xujiahui "Police Station" to the scene to suppress the situation and investigate where the gunshots came from, but the shooter had already fled.</p>
<h3>Flower Vendor Chen Maojian Abducted a Fellow Vendor and Extorted a Huge Sum of 1,000 Yuan. The Incident Was Exposed, and He Was Arrested by the Police and Prosecuted.</h3>
<p>Chen Maojian, a local resident residing at No. 3 Touba Road, has been selling flowers in the Hongkou Small Vegetable Market without a permit. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council Engineering Department discovered this and arrested him on the 24th of this month, ordering him to obtain a license. Unexpectedly, Chen vented his anger on Yao Hongsheng, a flower vendor from Pudong in the same market, believing that he had informed the Shanghai Municipal Council License Department. That afternoon, he invited four people, including the rogue Xiao Shaoxing, to beat him up. Not content with this, at 10:45 a.m. on the 27th, these people hired a car from Yitai Car Company and went to the Small Vegetable Market. Without asking any questions, they handcuffed Yao Hongsheng and dragged him into the car, speeding to a teahouse near the iron gate of Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, extorting 1,000 yuan to settle the matter. As a result, Yao wrote a note promising to pay 100 yuan to compensate Chen for the license fee and the confiscated flowers. At that time, Yao's wife had reported the information to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Chen Maojian and bring him to the police station. Xiao Shaoxing and others, upon learning that Chen had been arrested, released Yao and fled in different directions. The criminal Chen was sent to the First Special Court yesterday. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested a postponement. Then, the victim Yao Hongsheng testified about what had happened. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Leather Bag Containing Eight Pounds of Opium Valued at 5,000 Yuan; Transporting Opium and Robbing Opium Both Prosecuted</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 27th, at 1:20 p.m., Jiang Derong and Liu Amao, opium traffickers from Yangzhou, were carrying eight pounds of opium valued at 5,000 yuan in a leather bag, walking near Yuan Chang Road on Broadway, when they were surrounded by four rogues, Zhou Lichun, Song Ziming, Deng Yonglin, and Chen Guangjing, who robbed the opium. At that time, Chinese detectives Wang Shubei and Song Jiabao happened to pass by and arrested both sides, along with the opium, and took them to the Hongkou Police Station for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the police were prosecuting them for transporting opium and robbing opium, according to the criminal law. The defendant Jiang Derong said that the opium was given to them by Diao Chunzi, a chief steward on the Lushan Maru ship, and that they were transporting it from Tianjin to Shanghai to be temporarily stored at No. 7 Zhiyu Lane on Jiujiang Road, intending to transport it to Hankou, etc. The truth is unknown. He requested a postponement of the case to investigate the truth and arrest the principal offender. When questioned, Jiang Derong confessed that Liu Amao had asked him to temporarily send the leather bag to a certain place on Jiujiang Road, and that he did not know the details, begging for leniency. Liu Amao said that the opium belonged to Diao Chunzi, a friend of the chief steward on the Lushan Maru ship, and the rest of his testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation.</p>
<h3>On the Small Vegetable Market</h3>
<p>— Lin Huo</p>
<p>Early morning——Perhaps it's very early for you, when the maids in the gentlemen's rooms carefully push open the bedroom door and walk in gently. They add pieces of coal to the stove with a rustling sound, pour a pot of ginseng soup from the "Five Watches Chicken" clock on the mahogany table, and bring it to the gentleman's bedside. The gentleman leans half-way up, and the concubine helps you put on your clothes, drink the ginseng soup, and then sleep with the concubine for an hour or two. Or perhaps the young mistresses, lying in bed, instruct the old maids standing respectfully outside the door to buy some delicacies for the young master sleeping next to you. At that moment, when the students of our alley's primary school have finished their first class and are happily playing hide-and-seek in the courtyard, and the workers in the Gongsan Factory have already worked for more than two hours, I would like to ask the gentlemen, ladies, young mistresses, and concubines to grant me a favor, and instead of going back to sleep, put on your silk-cotton clothes and long-haired coats, and let me lead you on a short walk in such an early, cold morning. On this road, I guarantee there will be no kidnappings, because kidnappers would never think that gentlemen would come to this road. However, the ground is very wet, so don't forget to wear leather shoes and bring a handkerchief sprinkled with perfume.</p>
<p>Coming out of your room with the stove burning, it is indeed very cold outside. After walking through the quiet alley and turning a few corners, you are already in a not-so-orderly "lane" residential area. Your cars may have sped through here before, but the rapid speed didn't give you time to carefully observe the messy arrangements inside those houses. Look in the direction I'm pointing, the window of that two-story building is hanging a "small vegetable cupboard," as if it's about to fall down and hit pedestrians on the head. Over there, a manure cart is parked, the sound of washing the toilet is not very pleasant, and the smell is also hard to bear, quickly take out your perfume-soaked handkerchief. At the corner of the turn is a fried dough stick stall, next to it is a glutinous rice ball stall, next to it is a fried tofu vermicelli stall, and then down the line are all tightly packed stalls. At this intersection, there are several patrol officers standing, like they are watching your houses, holding very thick rattan whips.</p>
<p>This is already the small vegetable market, it's very noisy, isn't it! Gentlemen are used to the sounds of gongs and drums in theaters and the "pong chak" sounds in dance halls. Although this is also a loud sound, it is probably not very comfortable. Over there at the entrance of Lu Gaojian, snow-white meat is hanging. Gentlemen must be wondering why those people holding small vegetable baskets in one hand only look at the entrance and don't run in to buy meat.</p>
<p>The stalls are all kinds, with vendors ranging from seventy or eighty-year-old men to five or six-year-old girls. Many people are crowded together, even fighting over a radish or a small handful of bean sprouts.</p>
<p>People buying shiny hairtail are shouting loudly to each other, gathering a large crowd. Everyone is enviously flipping through the hairtail, but very few will agree on a price and buy it. Most people retreat from the crowd with their eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Gentlemen say that those things are really unhygienic, all scooped up by hand, unlike your chefs at home who are so clean, using knives and forks for everything. I tell you, if you can't eat anything, don't blame me, the things gentlemen eat are bought like this.</p>
<p>Gentlemen express sympathy for those ten-year-old vendors, but wait, a little girl selling vegetables at a large stall is being beaten by a patrol officer over there! Probably because she doesn't have a permit. Originally, in addition to fulfilling their protective duties for gentlemen when necessary and copying numbers in various alleys, their most outstanding masterpiece is still on the small vegetable market. Seeing a stall without a permit, they lift their leather shoes and kick over the vegetables or bean sprouts in the basket with one foot, and after kicking it over, they will step on it hard a few times, and then send the empty basket and the vendor kneeling next to it and kowtowing repeatedly onto the truck, fining them three or five yuan.</p>
<p>Gentlemen have finally deigned to give me face, but the small vegetable market is not finished yet. But never mind, it's very windy outside!</p>

<h3>Fourteen Kinds of Goods Allowed Free Import to Increase Raw Materials for Inland Flour Mills, Yarn Mills, and Cloth Factories</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan has issued a circular to the provincial and municipal governments and chambers of commerce, stating that fourteen kinds of goods, regardless of their origin from any country or any place in the country, shall be allowed free import: (1) Rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, wheat flour, biscuits, miscellaneous grain flour; (2) Cotton, cotton yarn (not exceeding 23 counts), cotton cloth (the cotton yarn used for warp and weft is not exceeding 23 counts); (3) Steel and hardware materials; (4) Machinery and tools; (5) Transportation equipment and accessories; (6) Communication equipment and accessories; (7) Cement; (8) Gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil; (9) Medical supplies and treatment equipment; (10) Chemical raw materials; (11) Agricultural insecticides; (12) Salt; (13) Alcohol; (14) Gunny bags. For the fourteen kinds of commodities that have been opened, no proof is required, and all are allowed free import. Exported goods from the occupied areas, if they are the above-mentioned opened goods, shall be allowed to be released. In terms of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, cotton yarn not exceeding 23 counts and cotton cloth using yarn with warp and weft not exceeding 23 counts shall also be allowed to be released. However, other products will still be prohibited. It is reported that the National Government's opening of fourteen kinds of goods is to take into account practical needs and facilitate consumption. For example, the opening of wheat, cotton, and cotton yarn is to avoid the lack of raw materials for inland flour mills, yarn mills, and cloth factories.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in the United States and the Philippines Are Eager to Show Their Patriotism and Compete to Purchase Aviation Bonds, Reaching More Than 7 Million</h3>
<p>According to people from the United States, since the government promoted the sale of aviation national salvation bonds overseas, overseas Chinese have enthusiastically subscribed, and the results have exceeded expectations. At present, the Americas have subscribed for more than 6.3 million US dollars, and the Philippines has also reached 1 million Philippine pesos, which shows the patriotism of overseas Chinese and their concern for the construction of the motherland. A vegetable farmer in Vancouver poured out his life savings of 1,100 yuan to purchase 11 aviation bonds worth 100 yuan each. In addition, on a small island in the West Indies, two overseas Chinese brothers who run a small business spent all their savings of 2,400 yuan to purchase one bond. Even ten-year-old children understood the great righteousness of patriotism and used their lucky money to buy bonds. Their noble spirit is a model for the world.</p>
<p>The Americas</p>
<p>Currently, the number of subscriptions reported in the Americas, in addition to 500,000 US dollars in Chicago, includes 1 million US dollars subscribed by overseas Chinese in San Francisco, 200,000 in Boston, 300,000 in Western Canada, 300,000 in Eastern Canada, 250,000 in Cuba, 100,000 in Honolulu, and other departments are also competing to be the first, with a total amount of more than 6.3 million US dollars, which has been successively remitted by various departments directly to the Jiu Yu Shan Guangdong Bank for the construction of the air force for the motherland government. This bond sale campaign is scheduled to end at the end of January next year, and all responsible persons will return home after the end.</p>
<p>The Philippines</p>
<p>In the Philippines, after Dai Jitao was sent to Nanyang, the overseas Chinese in various ports were also extremely enthusiastic, and the total amount of subscriptions has reached more than one million yuan. According to the total number of overseas Chinese in North and South America, which is only 300,000, such results have already been achieved. In Nanyang, there are millions of overseas Chinese, so the fundraising results will inevitably be better in the future.

<h3>Tongfu Road Opium Den Convicted; Defendants Refuse to Accept the Sentence and Appeal, Claiming They Were Deceived by Ding Guohua and Requesting Reversal; The Court Adjourned the Hearing and Awaits Judgment</h3>
<p>A man named Ding Guohua previously opened a large-scale opium den on Tongfu Road in the Public Concession. Its business was no less than that of other opium dens. On October 14th of this year, Ding ordered his opium den employees Qian Yangyuan and Liu Mingsheng to carry 128 taels of opium and take a car from the opium den, with Cao Musheng, a local, as the driver, to send the large quantity of opium to an opium customer at a paint shop on Shandong Road. They were intercepted by the Public Concession police at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Shandong Road and arrested, along with 128 taels of opium, and sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court for prosecution according to law. The case has been tried by Judge Xiao Xiefen, who sentenced Qian Yangyuan and Liu Mingsheng to five years' imprisonment each for transporting opium together, and fined them 1,000 yuan each, and deprived them of their civil rights for five years. If the fine is commuted to labor, each 1,000 yuan will be converted into six months of labor. Cao Musheng was sentenced to two years and six months' imprisonment. Qian Yangyuan and others refused to accept the sentence. Qian Yan hired lawyer Wu Chuliang, and Liu Mingsheng and Cao Musheng jointly hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court, requesting a reversal. The High Court granted the request, and the Presiding Judge and the Prosecutor held a collegial panel hearing to re-examine the case. The appellant Qian Yangyuan stated that he was 31 years old and from Zhenjiang, and insisted that he did not know anything about the joint transportation of opium beforehand. According to the appellant Liu Mingsheng, Boss Ding gave him a package on the day of the incident and asked him to take it by car to the paint shop on Shandong Road, but he did not know that the package contained opium. According to the appellant Cao Musheng, he was a driver at Li's residence, and on the day of the incident, he was ordered by his master to drive Qian Yangyuan, Liu Mingsheng, and others to Shandong Road, and did not know that they were carrying a large quantity of opium. The court also questioned the detectives who handled the case and ordered the debate to begin. The police lawyer and the defense lawyers for each appellant debated for a long time. Each appellant unanimously requested a reversal. The court considered that the facts were clear, declared the hearing closed, and scheduled a date for judgment. Each appellant was returned to custody.</p>

The debt has been outstanding for more than ten years, and the principal and interest are about 6,000 yuan. He requested that the defendant and the guarantor be jointly ordered to pay off the debt.

<h3>Why Not Give It a Try?</h3>
<p>— Jing Shusen</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Qiulang's "Deliberations on Two Porridges and One Meal," I feel that this method is good news for the salary class struggling on the isolated island. Because this method is easy to implement. It has no impact on nutrition; and it can save a lot of expenses. A win-win situation, why not do it?</p>
<p>It is not the author exaggerating to sensationalize, because the author's family has always implemented the "two porridges and one meal" system; and it has been implemented for many years, so it can be said to be "inherited from ancestors," right?</p>
<p>Of course, in peaceful times, it doesn't matter; but in years like these, it's a blessing! It not only saves rice and dishes, but also saves fuel and labor. Now I will write down the author's experience below:</p>
<p>Let's start with eating porridge for breakfast. The porridge mentioned here is not "rice congee," but "rice soaked in porridge." Therefore, the coal stove in the morning is usually not lit unless it is absolutely necessary. Just soak the leftover rice from the night before in some boiling water and simmer it on a kerosene stove for a few minutes to satisfy your hunger.</p>
<p>The midday meal is the most important of the three meals; the dishes to go with the rice will naturally be better. Chicken, fish, and meat are certainly rare; but green vegetables and tofu are our only gifts. However, the key to "saving" is not this, but to increase the amount of food that will be used for the evening meal and for making porridge the next morning when cooking the rice and dishes.</p>
<p>Speaking of making porridge for dinner, it is certainly the same as making it for breakfast; the difference is that instead of a kerosene stove, a coal briquette stove is used. Because you can use the remaining heat to boil some water and store it in a thermos for use the next morning.</p>
<p>Finally, I have to add a few words. The above is just a general description; how to use it depends entirely on the housewife's constant changes. At first glance, there seems to be little difference between "two porridges and one meal" and "one porridge and two meals"; but if you calculate carefully, you can save a lot of money on fuel alone for three hundred and sixty-five days a year! If you don't believe me, why not give it a try?</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Makeup</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Skin as smooth as cream, indeed, this fully expresses the tenderness and smoothness of the skin, as lovely as condensed fat. Needless to say, it describes your beauty as celestial, intoxicating the soul. It can be seen that tender and smooth skin is the basis of your beauty. From the standpoint of scientific beauty, this basis is very simple, that is, do not ignore the problem of daily skin care.</p>
<p>When you brush your hair, you can increase the effect by double. The method is as follows: sit on a low stool, stretch your legs straight, lean your head back, and then brush your hair with a hairbrush. This posture can make your scalp ruddy and healthy.</p>
<p>After applying face powder, Pan Lixi Lalan uses a cotton cloth dipped in cologne to remove excess powder from the forehead, and then wrings the cotton cloth very dry and pats it on various parts of the face, so that the face powder sticks firmly to the skin.</p>
<p>After you brush your eyebrows clean, use an eyebrow pencil of the appropriate color to lengthen your eyebrows, but do not draw them downwards, because if you draw them downwards, it will easily show a look of sorrow.</p>
<p>If you have a little extra perfume, you can put it on the outside of the telephone receiver to avoid odors. This is a very practical method.</p>
<p>When applying facial cream at night, you can use the same cream to apply to your hands, and then apply powder. This can make the color of the nail polish and the color of the skin very harmonious.</p>
<p>Shaving soap is not only for men, but women can also use it, because its material is very soft and oily. It can make the skin pores clean, and it is very comfortable to leave it on the skin for ten minutes.</p>
<h3>"Family Diary"</h3>
<p>— Huai Mei</p>
<p>In a family, affairs are numerous and complicated. Unless all matters, large and small, are properly handled, it is impossible to see order and organization; however, a person's energy is limited. For certain major events, one can cope with ease, but only for trivial matters may one be able to attend to one thing and lose sight of another. A slight oversight will immediately reveal shortcomings, which is absolutely unbearable for those who are enthusiastic about family affairs, and which those who love their families cannot ignore. Therefore, wise heads of households and housewives often use notebooks to record all relevant matters for future reference and discussion. Moreover, some heads of households and housewives are negligent in simplifying family affairs and are therefore hasty and casual. Not only are they negligent in trivial matters, but they are also careless in major matters such as economic budgets and records of income and expenditure, eventually leading to a high platform being built and being trapped in sorrow without realizing it. The depth of suffering is truly beyond description. If they could pay attention to the allocation of income and expenditure, budgeting, and statistics beforehand, there would be no regrets afterwards. Drawing inferences from one instance, using this as a metaphor for that, it is not difficult to imagine how important it is to be prepared for a rainy day.</p>
<p>Up to now, among the practical and generous record books, the diary books sold on the market are the first to be recommended. This is because these diaries are all-encompassing and economical and convenient. All daily needs, including correspondence, income and expenditure records, meetings with relatives and friends, etc., are included in great detail; however, although there are many types, it seems that there is still a lack of a diary that is purely designed for families, which is inevitably regrettable. However, yesterday I obtained a type of family diary published by the Health Family Society on the market. In addition to the diary paper commonly seen in general diaries, name and address lists, letter receipt and publication tables, book purchase tables, income and expenditure summary tables, and communication registration tables, it also has economic budget tables, family birthday tables, ancestral name commemoration tables, sixty-year birthday calculation tables, newly revised etiquette, communication etiquette, writing style for gift seals, a collection of congratulatory inscriptions, standards of health, knowledge of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, first aid knowledge and other practical materials indispensable to families. It can be said that the content is rich and meets the needs. Those who care about family affairs should have one copy per person. This diary is finely bound in cloth, with additional illustrations and quotations from world celebrities attached to the diary paper. You can be friends with famous sayings every day, and it goes without saying that it is enough to cultivate integrity and thoughtfulness.</p>
<h3>Points to Note for Tuberculosis Patients in Winter</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>In winter, due to the cold weather, we are most prone to bronchitis. Bronchitis is mainly characterized by coughing and phlegm. If tuberculosis patients also develop bronchitis, they will feel even more pain, so they should pay attention to avoiding it. The method is to wear more clothes, do not catch cold, and do not go to cold places from warm places wearing only the original clothes.</p>
<p>In tuberculosis patients with bronchitis and emphysema, the onset is more severe in winter, which is enough to affect their health. These patients must be careful in winter and should keep their homes warm and wear more clothes when going out.</p>
<p>The onset of tuberculosis often presents with symptoms such as fever, cough, and phlegm, which are easily confused with common colds and coughs. Therefore, if these symptoms occur and do not improve after more than three weeks, it is best to seek medical treatment for a proper diagnosis, and do not mistakenly believe that this is just a common winter cold and cough to mislead yourself.</p>
<p>In cold weather, we often make a fire in a confined space to keep warm. However, at this time, the flue of the stove may not be properly connected, or a stove with a small closure may be used, so that coal smoke accumulates in the room, which is enough to stimulate the patient to cough and choke, which is not appropriate. Therefore, it is best for tuberculosis patients to use hydronic heating instead of a stove.</p>
<p>Taking tonics in winter is a common habit. Tuberculosis patients can take cod liver oil and inject various vitamin preparations in winter, such as vitamin B and E, to increase the body's resistance. In addition, milk, eggs, etc. are also suitable.</p>

<h3>One Week's Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Everyone knows that soybeans are very high in vitamins; therefore, soymilk made from soybeans is one of the most common tonics. Although the price of soybeans is much more expensive than before, a bowl of soymilk is still much cheaper than a pound of milk that costs more than one yuan. When it comes to cooking, soybeans can also be used in various ways. Vegetarians can have a bowl of stir-fried soybeans with sweet sauce, and those who like spicy food can add some chili oil. Adding golden needles, wood ear, and small fried tofu is also very tasty. For meat eaters, it is not only delicious, but also very nutritious. If you want to be more economical, then slice the meat into shreds and have a bowl of shredded pork and soybean soup, which is also not impossible.</p>

<h3>Chemical Small Talk</h3>
<p>— Yan Hong</p>
<p>Winemaking is one of mankind's oldest and earliest chemical crafts.</p>
<p>The vapor of hydrofluoric acid can make the surface of glass rough (i.e., frosted glass).</p>
<p>Some say that taking arsenic (arsine) may allow one to carry heavy objects and climb high mountains without feeling difficult or painful, and at the same time be resistant to cold.</p>
<p>The by-product of gas production - coal tar - used to be a waste, but today it is considered a treasure because coal tar is needed as a raw material for the manufacture of dyes, drugs, seasonings, and cosmetics.</p>
<p>The narcotic drugs used by doctors, such as trichloroethane (sleeping medicine) and ether (yi tu), are really a great benefit to humanity.</p>
<p>Chlorine gas or chlorine water can bleach ordinary ink (such as ferrous tannate), but cannot bleach the ink used for printing (carbon).</p>
<p>Modern chemical advances have made it possible to treat all liquid oils by hydrogenation to make solid fats for the manufacture of soaps or for sale as artificial butter.</p>
<p>Mixing chalk powder and a small amount of sodium sulfide with water to make an award, and applying it to silverware that has lost its luster over the years, can immediately restore it to its original state.</p>
<p>The reasons for food spoilage are roughly the following six: water, light, air, metals, enzymes, and microorganisms.</p>
<p>When applying paint, do not apply it too thickly, because it cannot dry in a short time, which will inevitably prolong the time. Therefore, it is most suitable to apply it thinly several times.</p>

<h3>Cotton Trade Front</h3>
<p>— Ping Tang</p>
<p>...A portrayal of Shanghai...</p>
<p>Doo... Doo... Doo...</p>
<p>Another large cotton business has filled three trucks with cotton and is speeding away. The porters sitting on the top are holding long whips and looking around vigilantly, waiting to disperse the beggars who are robbing cotton.</p>
<p>The cotton picked by the villagers is placed in bags in front of the door to rest, and then gradually piled up. The clerk who is weighing is sweating brightly on his forehead, and is desperately raising his hoarse throat to shout.</p>
<p>He carefully carries the snow-white cotton, and in the past, the old and wrinkled black face is full of hope, and the weak and weak eyes are flashing with light. Alas! How annoying, the clear snot on the tip of the nose is hanging again; so he raises his sleeve to wipe it, and wipes it casually on his short jacket. "Cough! Cough!"</p>
<p>It's his turn. He respectfully presents it, trembling hands holding down the protruding cotton - don't drop a piece of precious cotton!</p>
<p>"Let go of your hand! Swine!" The weighing clerk yells.</p>
<p>"Um - yes! Yes!" His shrewd eyes are stingily staring at the stars on the scale. "It has to be knocked out a little bit, sir!"</p>
<p>"Medium to low... forty-six pounds." His cotton is put down and discarded aside.</p>
<p>"Sir! It's really more than this amount! Sir! Please weigh it again, it's more." His face suddenly turns mournful, and it looks even more strangely ugly, which makes people feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"Get out! This is not a place to make trouble." The weighing clerk roars. "Ah Lin! Come over and pull him away, it's up to him whether he sells it or not."</p>
<p>"Here I come!" Raised eyebrows, bulging eyes, fleshy face, Ah Lin in a "white-faced" outfit with black long shirt rolled up white sleeves responds and approaches.</p>
<p>"Go, go, go! Old friend! Be sensible!"</p>
<p>"But, sir! I weighed fifty pounds! The balance is not short of even an ounce. Sir! Can you weigh it again! Sir!..." He keeps saying tirelessly.</p>
<p>"It's obviously forty-six pounds. Weighing it a hundred times, a thousand times, it's still forty-six pounds. Go out and ask around, we never treat anyone unfairly here. We don't deceive the young, we don't cheat the old. Go inside and get the money, and no one will compensate you if you make a mistake later." The man called Ah Lin pushes him to the accounting office, but his withered mouth is still moving slightly.</p>
<p>"Are you forty-six pounds? Medium to low, forty-nine yuan, take it!" The accountant counts a stack of banknotes for him, but he doesn't take it, and puts it on the corner of the table.</p>
<p>"Oh! Sir! It's not even fifty yuan? Alas! To sell my cotton, when passing that "checkpoint", two were confiscated. They kicked me with their leather shoes. This is the third time, and I still "offered" a dollar. Alas! It's the blood and sweat of our whole year! Sir! Please make it up to an even fifty! Sir! I spent money on planting, ginning, passing the "checkpoint",... Sir! Have pity on me!" No one pays attention to him, it's just his monologue, and tears flow down the wrinkles uninhibitedly.</p>
<p>"Okay, go away, medium to low quality, forty-nine yuan, not even half a cent less, or you can take it back!" Ah Lin pushes him out of the door as soon as he finishes speaking.</p>
<p>"Alas, God!" He carries the carrying pole slowly and looks back at the crowd longingly.</p>
<h3>You Try Being Hungry!</h3>
<p>— Zhi Zhi</p>
<p>This is a common living drama, and the location is in the market. Don't think that this is a small matter in the street. If you think about it deeply, you may be frightened, because this location may be changed to your home (?)</p>
<p>In Stealing Chicken Bridge, a guy is tiptoeing behind a plump woman. The woman is carrying two paper bags under her arm and a few paper boxes in her hands, and is hailing a rickshaw. Suddenly, the guy quickly runs forward, grabs the two paper bags under the woman's arm, and runs away as if flying. He has already torn open one of the paper bags and is chewing it. In a moment, he turns a corner and disappears. Although the woman is screaming loudly, people think this is a small matter (?) They just watch. Some people even laugh when they see the woman's extreme appearance.</p>
<p>I also followed and turned a corner. When I walked through a dirty alley, the guy was distributing the chicken cakes from the second paper bag to his young son, a daughter with a braid, and the baby in his wife's arms. My sudden appearance made him raise his head and look at me. I said with a wry smile: Don't be afraid of me, I don't..." "I'm not afraid of you!" The guy snatched the words. This answer stunned me. "You're not afraid even after robbing something?" I thought. "Aren't you afraid? What about the police?" He answered bluntly. "Police, I'm not afraid, I'm afraid of being hungry?" He said, bending down and gently kissing his baby. "Don't you understand? Then you try being hungry!" Because I was still staring at him blankly, he got annoyed! "Aren't you ashamed?" I asked unintentionally, but he smiled and shook his head at me. Of course, I'm too naive, "When clothing and food are sufficient, people know honor and disgrace."</p>
<p>Today, a mother's relative showed us the things that were left after being robbed, and everyone laughed. The child next door cried and told his mother: "Two big cakes have been robbed!" His mother also laughed.</p>
<p>Is this really laughable? Think about it, what if this location is changed to your home (?)</p>
<h3>Willow of Zhangtai</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Mu Zhai said: "Madam, don't see capital. I will certainly die, but I wonder why the hurry. Firstly, although Jinling has fallen, the enemy troops have not yet killed to Yushan, and there is plenty of room in between. Secondly, there are many loyal and righteous men in Jiangnan. Who knows if someone will raise an army to serve the king and establish another King Lu, imitating Shao Kang's revival and the Southern Song Dynasty's half-country? Keep this body, and maybe it will be useful in the future. I must ask you to understand my painstaking efforts." Liu Rushi raised her moth eyebrows and said: "Pah! What painstaking efforts? You're just afraid of death. Why do I have to pretend like this? I know that you are old and your heart is shaken. How can you compare with Wen Wenshan and Shi Gabu? You are just a coward who steals his life and is afraid of death! Those who know etiquette and righteousness are like this, so what about the others? Hmph! You are really a bitch. What you said in the past is not enough to be believed. Since you are afraid of death, then why bother to coax people?" Liu Rushi had never been angry with Mu Zhai before. Today can be said to be at the height of her anger. Mu Zhai listened to her speaking eloquently, justly and forcefully, and it was impossible for him to deal with it with his evasive words, so he had to let her scold him and endure it patiently. At this time, Mu Zhai had the demeanor of letting people spit on his face and waiting for it to dry. Rushi continued: "I am not a cruel-hearted person either, forcing you to die together, just because I have something that I have to die for, so I don't want to live in vain. Living in humiliation and bearing grievances is not as good as dying with glory and integrity? That's why the ancients had a rumor that "I would rather die for Yuan Can than live as Chu Yuan". Today, if you die, you will be famous in history. If you steal your life in the world, then the things in the future will be unpredictable, I can't say it, and I can't bear to say it. I want you to die because I love you. You should understand the great meaning of Spring and Autumn, why are you so timid like an ordinary person today? How can you not disappoint me to the extreme?" When Rushi said this, she took a handkerchief to wipe her tears, and she really couldn't help crying at this time. Mu Zhai showed an embarrassed face, stood up, walked to Liu Rushi, and repeatedly bowed and said: "Rushi, Rushi, don't be sad. I am very ashamed, I have failed your good intentions. But I still want to be proper to repay the country, and if I fail, I will continue with death. You must understand me. Dying in vain is not because I am afraid of death." Liu Rushi said hatefully: "Obviously you are afraid of death, why do you still say that you are not afraid of death? If you can't die now, how can you die in the future? From now on, I will never believe your words. Alas! Liu Rushi has not failed you, but you have greatly failed me." Mu Zhai just bowed. And said: "Please slow down, I will never fail you, and I also thank you for your good intentions." Liu Rushi turned her head away. She didn't say a word, and didn't pay attention. Mu Zhai was very bored, and went to take off his court clothes and changed his wet shoes. So he didn't want to die. (25)</p>
<h3>The Future of "Zhe Shao Hospital"</h3>
<p>— Huang Yuzhai</p>
<p>Since the Shaoxing Seven Counties Association initiated the establishment of "Zhe Shao Hospital," people from all walks of life have shown great concern. However, regarding the future of this undertaking, there are varying opinions. Some say that in the city's timber, coal, silk, liquor, and money industries, people from Shaoxing hold leading positions, so raising a small amount of money should not be difficult. Others say that while the strength of Shaoxing natives in the city's business circles is indeed strong, what can be done about their inherent stinginess? Some say that most Shaoxing people who are enthusiastic about charity are those without property, while the wealthy constantly maintain a wait-and-see attitude. In reality, in recent decades, Shaoxing natives in Shanghai are no longer what they once were. They deeply understand that closing oneself off makes it difficult to develop, while unity is sufficient for mutual assistance. They are also able to dedicate their efforts to the welfare of their hometown. The urgent fundraising of nearly two million yuan for disaster relief in Shaoxing this year is clear evidence of this. However, there are still those who cannot restrain themselves from speaking out, namely, the so-called bourgeoisie mentioned above, who ultimately fail to enthusiastically contribute. They believe that if they fall ill, money is omnipotent and that they need not worry about not being admitted to a well-equipped hospital. They believe that there will be famous Chinese and Western doctors to treat them, completely disregarding the fact that besides themselves, there are also relatives, servants, and poor neighbors and old friends. These people are struggling under the shackles of life, writhing in pain on their sickbeds. Do they still have the means to seek medical treatment? Therefore, the construction of "Zhe Shao Hospital" not only directly benefits the working class and the laboring masses but also indirectly benefits the middle and upper-class asset owners who hold positions as managers and bosses. How can they stand idly by and adhere to a "Monroe Doctrine" of indifference?</p>
<p>Let us consider this: since the establishment of our hometown association thirty years ago, due to the lack of hospital facilities, when hometown people fall ill, if they wish to be admitted to the "Si Ming Hospital," they must pretend to be Ningbo natives to be allowed entry. This kind of humiliation should be the full responsibility of wealthy hometown people. Therefore, before the "Zhe Shao Hospital" is completed, all Shaoxing natives, regardless of wealth or poverty, should do their utmost to solicit donations so that the magnificent building can be realized without difficulty.</p>
