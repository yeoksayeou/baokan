<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國將如何</h3>
<p>美國國務卿赫爾氏以及其他方面，在日本任命了前外相野村海將爲駐美大使後所作表示，如謂人人皆知美國地位，在主張國際關係應以法律爲根據；又謂野村卯何能使日本在華政策與渠所發東方各國必須對於其他各國繼續自由，而無限制的往來一語，不相矛盾：又謂日本行爲較其言論尤聲音洪亮，觸人耳鼓；又謂日本如欲改善對美關係必須將日本之政策加以根本上的改變，若僅更調駐美大使實無所補益；這些見解皆足證明美國對於中日問題的認識澈底、所待遠東政策的堅決穩定。同時，中國駐美大使胡適與中國銀行總裁宋子文二氏於隔昨會晤赫爾氏之後，其所談內容雖雙方秘而不宣，但據美國財政徬興委員會主席瓊斯氏所稱：美國頃方考慮予中國以更多之援助，中國之處境一日艱難，則吾人一日冀望盡吾人之所能，予以幫助；又謂中國期待獲得更多援助之意願，正在美國博得有利之反響，因中美兩國以前之交易極爲滿意云。試將美國對中日兩國的意態作一比較，當可窺見太平洋的前途雖風雲險恶，但亦正在光明與黑暗彼此搏擊之中；更證以東京方面舆論所勗勉野村者。皆稱美日關係備極惡劣，野村使命備極艱難，可見日人色厲內荏，並不怎樣的自信。</p>
<p>上述這些之中，我們雖感覺得包孕着　可欣慰的成分，有補於大局，但對於遏制侵略與安定遠東則還不夠加速其功效。遠在十四個月之前，日本當局亟圖調整日美邦交，乃因野村「曾經留學美國海軍學校，曾任駐美使館海軍武官，華盛頓會議中之日本代表之一，熟識美國朝野甚衆」而物色之爲外相。以爲對美國當有辦法；當時我們嘗指陳「美召現狀，癥結在於國策之根本矛盾；即美國致力於維持人類之文明原則，維持國際之公道原則，維持中國領土主權之完整，而日本方以武力破壞美國之所欲維持。矛盾超於外交而在政治之領域，此豈外相之才調所得而消弭；謂將以外相才調而變更外國之傳統國策，此絕不可能之事，然則野村何得調整之？調整美日現狀，要在日本放棄侵略，否則皆屬徒勞；觀於日本首腦不糾正其本身行動而惟責望於外相，可知日本首腦未能理解癥結，」野村終於一無成就，鎩羽下野。時隔年餘，再不能想像日本朝野還未觑破美日癥結所在；故當初日本期望於野村擔任外相者極殷切，而現在勗勉以使美者却已不是這一套。可見日本對美，一面是不計成敗的聊盡人事，而並無着望：一面維持對美外交關係的形式上之常態，不使使節遠懸，却在欺飾耳目，掩護其他活動，以爭取有利於自己的時間與空間。現在美國對於野村使美所表示的，完全與我們在十四個月以前所論相符：足徵個中癥結依然如故，亦見得美國態度雖極堅定，且已使日本知道了美國的鑒定，然仍未能有效的稍稍枓正年餘以來的現象。這是任何人所不得不感覺其不夠的。至於美國的對華援助，瓊斯氏所說，蓄意極深遠；而中國胡宋二氏與赫爾氏晤談，當然並非虛相酬對；接洽內容自非局外所得了然，然僅就跡象而言，美國對華而如瓊斯氏所謂兩國以前之交易，極爲滿意：乃至如美國對英而如昨日路透社華盛頓電稱參議院外交委員會主席喬治氏所謂擴大財政上援助之舉動，先須有對於英國資源之調查；原來任何援助必有其相當之價值，然以當前的國際情况與其紛亂性質，則美國援華援英而祇以交易滿意與資源調查爲攷盧援助的根據，如此範圍的攷慮亦必爲任何人所感覺爲不夠的。日本並不因美國主張維持越南現狀而中輟其壓迫，終於與法人簽訂越南協定，取得河內海防爲根據地，往事不遠，可資警惕，而昨晚消息，法人更深一步的屈辱妥協，已由維希直接允許日本，在西貢開闢日本空軍根據地了。一躍再躍，南進又南進，西貢在河內與海防之南者又是一千里，究竟這是爲了對付中國而離滇緬路更近嗎？正相背道而馳，地理上絕不如此，日人蓋已利用了國際最弱的一環，沿法屬越南海岸而猛進，現在已經紆迴環繞而至菲列賓的西南，自西貢離英國所經營，美國所得借用的新加坡軍港祇剩六百五十里了！美國人士應如何針對這些嚴重現象，根據坚定的政策。重新攷慮其行動，急作有效的措施？</p>
<h3>日在西貢　設空軍根據地　已獲維希政府准許　日機不斷飛過河內</h3>

<h3>歐戰業談廿四　倫敦人的地下生活</h3>
<p>三個月以來，德空軍在英國所投下的炸彈小下五千萬磅，除了物質損失不計外，生命喪失，就平民而論約爲三千五百人。其中受害　大的當然要推倫敦了。但是央國人的堅毅苦鬬精神頗可佩服。倫敦在表面上看起來，似已瘡痍滿目，但據估計，建築物的遭轟炸而毀損的不過達總數白分之一；至於生命的喪失，就三個月以來的總數而論，尙不及美國一個月中因車輛肇禍而死者的數目。不過老百姓終因爲受德機的不斷轟炸，精神上大爲掃興，一夜不睡，三天沒有精神，何况連續着三個月之久呢，這當然也難怪了。</p>
<p>當局爲鼓勵民氣，再接再勵起見，文字宣傳無所不用其極。倫敦快報曾對大衆道：「你如能繼續着工作，那沒我們便能擊敗德國。要是你不能的話，那沒我們就要被他們擊敗了。」短短兩句，倒也字簡意賅，頗爲動。當局又在各觸目之處，張貼佈吿，叫老百姓不要氣餒，鼓勵他們的持久作戰精神。最近有一張佈吿爲上次大戰時前綫央軍據點的個戰壕裏所掘出來的。那一隊兵奉令堅守陣地，不得擅離，以待援軍開到，結果全隊殉難。這個命令由一個澳洲軍官簽字，上面寫着道：（一）此據點務要堅守，非待援軍開到，不得擅離。（二）無論如何不能使敵軍得逞。（三）如不能活着守此似點，也須死着堅守。（四）凡因受砲彈震驚而意欲投降者，這人仍須死在此地。（五）一據點堅守住，全陣綫可保全。</p>
<p>倫敦人常以「走」向防空室，而非「跑」向防空壕的精神，傲示世人。當局警吿人民，隨時預備些飲水帶入防空室，以便總水管爆炸時，不致無水可飲。又叫他們每次離開住宅時，總耍把煤氣管閉上。在空襲進行之時，除銀行之外，多數商行都照常營業。珠寳店被轟炸後，店主人常領職員在瓦礫堆中找尋寳石金鋼鑽。有許多人死於飛掠而來的玻璃碎片，它們的力量好似一棵子彈。</p>
<p>最感煩悶的爲倫敦全市的待產孕婦，其總數約在五萬人左右。還有十萬嬰孩的母親，也覺在燈火管制之下，哺乳及整　襁褓，十分麻煩。有一個倫敦婦人福斯德夫人，在臨盆期中，德機不斷的轟炸。有一天正在空襲進行時，她要生產了。這時候他丈夫已出去服務，也找不到醫生。只有一位空襲救護員在側。八十碼之外卽有炸彈爆發，把她臥房的屋頂及窗戶都震了去，那位救護員卽在黑暗的瓦礫堆中爲她接生，居然一個肥大嬰孩很順利的產下來了。</p>
<p>德機在倫敦所新投的燃燒彈，內含鋁質及鐵養氣，燃燒力高至四千度，掉下地面之後，很難熄滅。空襲過去之後，那些碎片還是在地上燒着。竟有些過路人把它燃起香烟來吃，或藉以烘手取暖，眞可謂大才小用了。</p>
<p>下面所記的說白，是美國生活雜誌及紐約泰晤士報駐倫敦訪員，葛萊納及米奇，於九月十八日夜德機空襲倫教時，所獲得的經騐。語語都是身歷其境的實話，讀之令人不寒而慄：</p>
<p>葛萊納：「晚七時三刻，我在每日快報館圖書參考部，搜集關於邱吉爾的材料之後，僱了街車回家，車夫開着快車，穿過黑暗的街道。他想在空襲警報還未發出前，驅車駛出倫敦市中心區。我們的住所在倫敦市僻靜處一幢十七世紀式的赭石房子中。在戰爭發生之前，此屋原係電影明星却爾斯勞頓所居，我正在進餐，自倫敦開始　空襲，煤氣斷絕後，我一直就用電灶煮東西。忽聽得德機在空中翁翁作聲，高射砲轟轟不已。炸彈的飛噓聲和爆炸聲，相繼並作。聲響越弄越響，我就決計跑下底層的酒窖中，暫時躱避。」</p>
<p>米奇：一下午傍晚之前，我到電影院去觀新聞片，並決計在四區進餐，不返家就食了。當我正在吃軟煎蛋和飲着半瓶法國葡萄酒的時候，侍者宣佈夜間的「魔衲」Mona，一這是倫敦人稱空襲警報的別名，解除警戰呼之爲」克拉臘」Clara。）我吃完飯，開始返家，空中充滿了烟硝氣味，高射砲火光熾明，我是可以在馬路中間閱讀報紙。在空襲進行時是沒有方法可以喚得車輛的，所以我也不去向費時間了，只顧朝着回家的方白，半走半跑，遇到頸頂上有爆炸物時。便跳到人家門口暫爲躱避。倫敦人叫這裹走路方法爲「望門跳」！當我正走近進宅時，右面忽然紅光亮，繼之以劇列的爆炸聲音。因爲正路中間沒有可暫躱避的門戶，我只得站立着小動。沒有東西在我身旁掉下來，我拔腳直奔住宅而去。一到家中看見葛萊納躲在地下室中，管家婆正要跑出來迎候她的丈夫。1等到高射砲聲音停止，我飛奔上樓去換舊衣服，預備臥在地下室，管家婆也跟了上樓，打電話給她的丈夫。」（未完）</p>

<h3>傍晚利買　金市劇漲</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、由平疲突趨劇漲、五千七百元大關曾數度回入、終見昂近五千八百元關、各方人心甚堅、乃傳日向華求和未允、有將承認某方之傳說、投機家竟爲利多空氣、外匯報緊、致將買風引起也、自晨開尙乎、仍五千七百〇五元、金號錢莊吐售、曾壓小至五千六百九十元、銀號滙票商收吸、價盤於五千七百元左右、午刻一度堅漲、不久卽平、下午利買消息傳來、雖見某金號之傾出、而證券幫銀號滙票商之一再傾進、外匯父報緊、漲勢加厲、竟步上至五千七百九十三元高價、終爲五千七百九十元、軋升八十五元、全日交易共五千餘兩、掉期買方貼出予賣方爲四五元、少成交、現金小錢莊出金號數十爾、價比期交低五元、飾金關余等均平、</p>
<h3>烚赤跳八十五元</h3>
<p>初以　　頗形冷落、交易少、價亦平、計金號對做二十兩、爲五千七百〇五元、作晨開價、不久錢兌業沽予銀號三十兩、撳入五千七百元關內、計五千六百九十元、後　銀號幫略加搜購、止跌回升、惟上落有限也、銀號入金號二十兩、五千七百〇八元、而錢兌業又賣予銀號二十兩、又低達五千六百九十五元、嗣因外滙由鬆平轉軟化，散戶均思買進、銀號幫續撈、計余號出銀號三十兩、五千七白二十．∼元，午收於錢兌業賣出壓力下、仍降十兌、金號進十兩五千七百十二元、午後開盤已形堅好、錢兌業進證券幫二十兩、爲五千七百四十元、稍隔片刻、銀號沽予證券幫三十兩、爲五千七百二十二元、不意將近傍晚、市面忽轉、某方有承認之舉、人心受驚、滙市扒風下愈緊、故金價隨起、證券幫銀號大購、最高爲證券幫入金號二十兩五千七百九十三元、一時買賣極盛、晚收銀號人錢兌業三十兩、爲五千七百九十元、比上日軋漲八十五元、全日計一百〇三元上落、現金號之、　金售價、較烚赤高十餘元、收十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均無做開、</p>
<h3>首飾金昨未更動</h3>
<p>銀樓飾金未史、每兩兌出價、大同行仍懸五百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣亦各猛升</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價大漲，英美金鎊因亦各升二元、英金票忽又趨呆、市價站平、美金票突出十七元關、緣因市上叉傳關於新「中央銀行」之消息、以致黑市外滙扒風又熾、美金票乃步漲至十七元一角八分、比上日猛升四角、香港票趨勢堅挺、晚市爲四兀零三分、坎拿大票及菲列濱票均趨挺俏、日金蔡及朝鮮票需要均殷、前者高至一元五角四分、後者升爲一元一角六分半、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗徘徊不定　二百元關進而復出</h3>
<p>紗市復入迴旋之境、但形劣較爲安靜、此因上日之謠風、不足信任、所以一般拋空者、心思難看小、然老多頭尙未動搖、因之一度破進一千二百元關內、有一度反來扒空、市盤乃反動回升矣、不過目前現銷依然淡泊、做多之威、未曾十分發展也、就目前狀態論之、不致於趨落耳、昨有棉紗一千六百六十件、今日父有五百十件運香港、又四十件運小呂宋、十件運暹雜、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開市狀尙安定、首盤價爲一千二百十一元、於上日價不相上下、此盤一開、放空者異常踴躍、一時賣氣濃密、直跌至一千二百元內、最低價爲一千一百九十八元、旋聞外匯寗靜、價格旣落、拋賣勿願加碼、反見補進、於是籌碼轉緊、回風突現、復漲出關、升至一千二百十元、後有獲利者吐出，同時實銷不旺、再見回小、但多頭借不放棄、收盤價爲一千二白十四元、查半日　成交統計六千三百十包、行情二十支雙馬價漲叫元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>棉商觀望</h3>
<p>現棉交易、益形蕭條、良緣紗市乏勁、廠力多取觀望態度、至於商號鑒於以上情况、出路不爽、舉動亦不若昔日之盛、不過大衆心理、仍看堅定耳、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因利物浦之來電告漲、後又因華爾街股票市價之軟弱、及一部份南方套買結果收盤價格、較之上日降三四磅音、印度連同預測漲一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來頗爲靜寂、各方購　殊爲淡薄、尤以廠方爲最、同業亦因夕暫抱觀望態度、但一般預料、棉市將於F月中旬、方有轉機也、</p>
<h3>疋頭棉布逢廉　仍有收進</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市過程平穩、起伏僅一二角、實　續而不斷、出廠統稅聞有暫緩增加說、人心頗堅、同業及客戶逢廉、仍有吸納、各貨售盤堅定、粗細布小額手貨、嚴市跌每疋五分至一角半、午後卽台回升、結果平平、漂染布晨市平平、午後每疋漲二角半、本街成交各貨近千件、烟台幫辦粗布等一百餘件、粵港幫辦斜紋·色布·漂布·府綢等三百餘件、浙閩幫辦色布·色斜等二百數十件、</p>
<p>東布　晨跌午回、市氣轉堅、白貨龍頭細布上午市盤一度降至三十四元八角、後市因標金升騰、本街心思看好、續來吸納、步趨高昂、故收盤時龍頭細布售開三十五元三角、每疋較漲一角半、嗶嘰一元零八分、</p>
<p>出口　二十八日疋頭二千六百八十件運香港、又二十九日運小呂宋十三件、運暹遜四十二件、運香港一千六百九十五件、</p>
<h3>馬海絨盛行一時</h3>
<p>馬海賊日來頗爲暢銷、因其毛腳整密而齊、光彩　亮、顏色亦多、本埠仕女大半均趨之若鶩、海白龍又覺過時矣、故新近女大衣、多用馬海羢、目還購配手袋、按單購手袋一隻，至少須法幣二十五六元、於是其馬海羢大衣一襲、至少須法幣一百五六十元、其顏色盛行者、爲極淺之賣藍藏青、躉批每碼沽售八十七八元、三駝牌海白龍羢售六十四五元、</p>
<h3>糖市　赤白糖午後上升</h3>
<p>昨糖市初疲後緊、上落仍屬不多，公會劃盤上午現貨二四粗白本棧七十二元二角、小四角、外棧七十一元七角、小二角、荷赤現貨五十五元五角至三角、小二角至四角、太古車白B嘜西棧七十五元、HX嘜六十八元、無甚上落、午後赤白糖均叫升一元、未有成交、本一號冰九十二元、晶明冰九十三元半、小元許、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蘭竹枝來源缺</h3>
<p>蘭竹枝近以金山枝降價、至爲疲滯、但同時產價未能見鬆、且有特費等意外支出、成本愈高、致成倒懸之局、來源遂極稀少，並聞號方一致騷守未兌、首銷路如能發展、當有回振之望、</p>
<h3>藥材　參茸銀耳　昂貴非凡</h3>
<p>時屆冬令、正是進補氣節、參茸銀耳、市面無不活躍、四川銀耳、今因到貨奇缺、價近週又高漲不已、上檔者每斤二百六十餘元、中檔每斤一百六十餘元、F檔每斤亦要百元左右、吉林大山人參、今年因受統制關係、以致到貨全無、今年所出售者、皆是往年陳貨、且其價奇昂、每支重一兩者、每兩一千五百元、每支車一錢餘者、亦須四百元一兩、鹿茸因納稅苛重、雄壯者每架三千元、普通者二千左右、鋸茸每兩九十元、八十元、別直參、地三十支、存貨缺乏、實銷旺盛、照盤二百九十元一斤、尙難辦到、須加盤十元、每斤三百元方能買進一二因同業心思甚高看漲三百二十元、好在此皆是富貴之品、雖貴尙不影響到民生、</p>
<h3>五金　水泥鋼骨復原狀</h3>
<p>日前步趨下游之水泥鋼骨市况、昨日已見起色、因本街建築幫有採納、津幫亦見點綴、同業心思復原、市象漸見轉機、昨市成交四五十噸、行情因有納　關係、又見增高、如三四分一千一百五十元、五分至一寸一千八九十元不一、均比前升三四十元不等云、</p>
<h3>新盤元出六十元關</h3>
<p>昨日盤元交易雖並不如何熱鬧、然業中人心思却異常高昂、蓋是貨現時海外雖仍有貨裝埠、惟成本十分昂貴、水脚又見倍增、行盤乃日見步升、昨市成交三四十噸、喊價已出六十元大關、</p>
<h3>煤炭　印煤暗盤稍高</h3>
<p>印度烟煤、本市存底、雖甚充足、但近月來、到源則頗缺少、蓋水脚騰貴、成本猛高所致也、昨崗業拆價、稍形開高、計做印度烟煤棧單、暗盤已開兩百零八元、較月初漲起五六元行情、惟明市仍喊兩百十元云、</p>

<h3>提高待遇即将實現　華捕均忠勸服務　照常上差並無罷崗情事　生活困難局方早經考慮</h3>
<p>工部局警務處包文少校、對於昨日外傳華捕因要求加薪而以罷崗爲要挾之消息、加以否認、渠對記者稱、華捕均已上差、並無罷崗要挾事、包氏稱、各捕房華捕在上差之前、僅表明其有獲得增加薪水與米貼之願望、然後卽照常上差、工部局對於華捕薪額與米貼之增加、早已加以考慮、不久或卽有實行之可能、包氏否認在其所領導之警務處中、有仟何有組織之不滿表示、渠稱增加薪金及米貼之要求、雖各捕房華捕於星期三（廿七日）下午同時提出、但此事並無任何重要之意義、包氏解釋稱、或因各捕房華捕聞知靜安寺捕房華捕將提出此項要求之消息、故彼等亦決同時提出、</p>
<p>華捕要求提高待遇</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、公共租界五捕房華捕、爲求提高月薪、頃以罷崗相威脅、致上海現有發生本市有史以來罕遇的極嚴重工潮之可能、惟據工部局警務處長包文聲稱、華捕月薪、迅將增高若干、此事必可無所困難、卽吿解決無疑云、此事起於昨日（二十七日）午後、四捕房之夜班華捕計靜安寺捕房八十八人、戈登路捕房二十五人、普度路與新閘兩捕房各二十人、拒不出差、</p>
<p>警官保證必加考慮</p>
<p>至今日（二＋八日）午刻甫過、成都路捕房亦有華捕五十人報到後、拒不値崗、其代表旋與負責西籍警官密談、而內中若干華捕、亦已照常工作、罷崗華捕皆謂現有月薪、不敷應用、故要求基本月薪與米貼等立卽增加、經西籍警官保證負責者必加老慮崁、始相率出差，至今日仍工作如常、一方面正位警務處答覆、</p>
<p>如何增加正在研究</p>
<p>據包文吿記者、過去二三星期內、渠已與華捕首腦進行討論、且已作增加華捕月薪之準備、惟如何增加一節、尙未決定、大約不致以提高米貼之方式出之、今事件未完全解決、故尙無決定辦法、通知華捕、但一俟華捕得悉決定辦法、此事當可解決、</p>
<p>米貼數目根據市價</p>
<p>查公共租界華捕目下最低月薪爲十八元、另加生活津貼百分之八十五、米貼九元與戾貼若干、華捕方面謂昨日米價雖達空前高度、但彼等之米貼、近已减低一元半、工部局官員則謂津貼視市價而定、不無變動、</p>
<p>當局體諒生活困難</p>
<p>工部局助理總辦納許聲稱、當局對於華捕之困難正加考慮中、今各事似皆寗靜、華捕已吿復差、卽表不可獲妥洽、至於爭端能否於今明兩日內解決、仍未能斷言、因解決辦法、須　局方各委員會通過、</p>
<h3>日第三艦隊　集中舟山</h3>
<p>內有航空母艦兩艘據航業界確息、日駐華第三艦隊軍艦、現紛粉集於舟山羣島海面、該地岱山東沙角·沈家鬥·馬騎門·及定海衜頭港、東起東港浦、西迄竺山門海面、集結日艦大小共達十五六艘之多、對被扣外輪謀福·飛康·大生·等亦予監視、此中並有航空母艦兩艘、停泊附近、且往返調動甚繁、似有企圖、現沿海華軍、已予嚴密戒備、</p>
<h3>兩租界當局會商　廢除小租陋習</h3>
<p>雙方正加平行研究　數度舉行聯席會議</p>
<p>昨悉公共租界與法租界當局、已數度舉行聯席會議、以謀廢止兩租界內之小租陋習、據工部局發言人聲稱、法租界特殊委員會近提出報吿、建議在界內採取廢止小租等步驟後、工部局方面已與法當局數度會談、日後或將賡續此項談話、蓋兩租界對於廢止小租問題、正加平行之研究也、惟工部局目下僅從事研究、並未有所決定、同時、法租界居民現正繼續耍求法總領事馬傑禮接受委員會之建議、以取締小租等弊、但馬傑禮將於何時加以決定、尙無表示、</p>
<p>按期付租不得迫遷</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、駐滬法總領事馬傑禮、近接法租界租屋管理委員會擬就之領署命令（卽租屋章程）後、並已聽取各方報吿與批評、俾補領署命令之不足、本市某法僑名律師、曾對租屋問題撰文評論者、昨日（二十七日）午後訪晤馬傑禮、建議領署命令中應列入章程一條、規定凡房客按期付租不誤、而租金須作合理之增加時、亦加同意者、房東不得强迫其遷出、而不問租約是否滿期、此項章程、付諸實施後、卽可防杜房東强迫租約期屆之房客遷出、而另招能付較高租金與若干小租之房客、如果此項章程、不予實施、則整個領署命令、將失效用、蓋唯利是圖之房東、皆將利用此缺點也、一般人相信法總領事將從詳討論各報近已公布之領署命令草章、不久必將採取充份步驟、以廢止濫漲房租與收取小租等巧取豪奪方法、</p>
<h3>滬市「市警」　擅扣卡車　圖索照會費經交涉放回</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、謀得利琴行卡車一輛、昨日（廿七日）午前十一時許、循西區陸家宅路前駛、忽有「市警」一名勒令停駛、車夫不從、卽有另一「市警」躍上卡車踏板、强迫車夫停駛、然後將車扣留、午刻、謀德利琴行接得「市警局電話、謂該卡車未懸「市方照會、須繳款一百二十元、否則車不放行、琴行經理處答稱、非至說明理由、不繳此款、至午後該卡車小工一人持函返行、函由「公安局徐家滙分局出面、內有須繳四十一元九角三分、領取照會等言、謀德利琴行接函後、報吿靜安寺捕房前往交涉、至午後四時三十分許、車始釋出、但未繳任何費用、</p>
<h3>赴港手續　尚無變更　移民局滬辦事處現亦無成立之期</h3>
<p>自香港政府頒佈入境統制新條例、定下月十八日起實行、本市各大輪船公司如昌興·渣華·怡和·太古等、均已先後致電香港公司、詢問移民局關於本埠赴港旅客應另辦何種手續、但迄至昨日爲止、尚未接到香港方面覆電、據聞本埠英國領事署方面現亦未接港方電吿、故對於旅客之前去詢問、竟無從答覆、至於旅行手續是否變更、須待回電到達上海後、再能決定、據航業界稱、關於本市旅客今後赴港手續如何、將待移民局設立上海辦事處、再依照所頒入境新條例擬定上海旅客之赴港手續辦理、</p>
<h3>電話加價公表後　各方紛起責難　添新機與減少次數矛盾　市民切盼華董據理力爭</h3>
<p>上海電話公司、藉需要激增、無法應付爲由、提出增加附加費請求、經兩租界當局通過、並宜佈於下月七日正式實行後、本市各界聞訊之餘、議論紛紛、羣表不滿、據華人方面一般意見、以爲該公司藉作增加之主要理由者、爲須添置新機、擴充設備、在目下需要增加情况下、公司此舉、自無可非議、</p>
<p>新機費用應予攤算</p>
<p>但增加新機費用雖大、應用時期、亦甚久長、如以新機價格依應用年代計算、則每年平均所費、其數甚微、今該公司竟增加二倍以上、姑無論其已盡失公共事業之意義、卽與該公司所稱增加之理由、亦殊難吻合、蓋公司增價後、收入增加百分之七十、但購置新機、在其應用時期內、每年平均所費、實遠低此數也、</p>
<p>減少次數殊欠理由</p>
<p>再則減少基本通話次數與超出次數之增價理由、謂在使通話次數减少與增加速率、但在此畸形繁榮一日存在之時、則通話次數、卽決難减少、况公司旣欲增添新機、滿足顧客需要、則與此限制顧客之舉似屬矛盾現本市一般居民、咸盼各華董據理力爭設法挽回、以减低增加成數否則本市商業經此打擊、勢將獲不良結果、居民生活、亦將更感痛苦、</p>
<p>特種電話亦將加價</p>
<p>上海電話公司特種電話、如接通南市閘北市中心之「短程通話」、以前每次爲法幣一角、現聞因該公司增價之故、日方「華中電氣通信公司」已推派代表與上海電話公司進行談判、擬增加短程通話之價格、其成數尙在協議中、此外由該公司轉接外埠長途通話、原收手續費一角、但是否亦將增價、聞亦在考慮中，</p>

<h3>洋粉定貨　十分之一平售　工部局主張各定戶　盼望對囤米處同樣</h3>
<p>工部局前經商同阜豐福新兩麵粉廠、自十月十一日起、每日供給平價麵粉八·〇六五包、每包廠盤原爲十七元、嗣因洋麥來價較增、自本月二十五日起、改爲每包十八元、外加零售粉號手續費三角、茲悉工部局爲進一步</p>
<p>調劑起見</p>
<p>昨日特由該局糧食委員會主席馬歇爾氏分函本市各大洋粉進口洋行、請其轉商各定戶提出定貨分之一、轉發各重要粉號、平價發售、售價定每包十八元（與本街粉廠盤相同）、外加手續費三角、上項洋粉到埠、貨款每包重要粉號負責出貨、貨款每世十八元、則於事前付給、各該洋行已贊同局方建議、而</p>
<p>洋粉定戶</p>
<p>亦慨予合作、查麵粉零售每包十八元三角、價格固屬高昂、但爲阻止再漲起見、定貨提成乎售、頗屬正當、現在米價逐步高漲、民不聊生、各界聞訊、均盼工部局對棧存囤米、有同樣性質之舉措也、</p>

<p>坐禪儀又云、「放舍諸緣、休息　事、身心一如、　靜無間、正身端坐、舌柱上齶脣齒相着、目須微開、身相旣定、氣息旣調、寬放臍腹、一切善惡、都莫思量，念起卽覺、覺之卽無、久久忘緣、自成一片，四大輕爽、所謂安樂法門也、一切時中、護持定力、如護嬰兒、定水澄淸、心珠自現、此定能生慧之法敎·宋儒靜坐法門、程朱派曰「主敬」、原於書訓敬勝怠者吉」、易象乾三之日乾夕惕、坤二之敬以直內也、陸王派曰、「主靜」、原於易象艮彖「艮其背」、傳艮其止」、卽禪宗之「絕相心空、善惡吿無」是也周邵派曰、「主觀」、原於老子之觀妙」、「觀竅」、「觀復」、亦出易象觀爻之「觀生」、感卦之、觀感、卽天台宗之一心三觀·假　盡中、慧也、李延年每默坐澄心、騐未發時氣象、朱子稱爲龜山門下相傳指訣、</p>
<p>靜坐之益</p>
<p>月燈三味經云、「佛言若有菩薩住於宴坐、有十種利益」、乃至「－證四無礙智」、又佛言若有菩薩愛樂空閑、有十種利益」、乃至二十少施功而得三昧」、中庸曰、「至誠之道、可以前知、故」至誠如神」、易繫傳曰、「無思也、無爲也、寂然不動、感而遂通天下之故、非天下之至誠、其孰能與於此」、智者大師之　身·調息·調心、義詳「天台止觀」、其除障洽病之效、說見「佛祖統紀」、至楞嚴經云、「道胎已成」、華嚴經云、「如來出現」、則功成胎結」、靜坐之能事畢矣、</p>
<p>不靜之害</p>
<p>佛遣教經有「放逸入於五欲」之戒、圓覺經有「妄身當在何處」之警、皆言不知禪定之害、蓋道不可須臾離、「存乎人者而旦晝之所爲牿亡之」、則誘於物欲、而、人化爲物」、「陷溺其心」、非放不知求、流而忘返、卽揠苗助長、「而又害之」、故孟子「求放心一、「致良知」、「存夜氣」、「養浩然」、而至於不動心」、</p>

<h3>老鼠在民間</h3>
<p>— 乃流</p>
<p>誠　，一個初小二年級的孩子，他也會憎恨老鼠，知道老鼠對人類沒有半絲利益。那末，一個成牛的人，他們對老鼠給人們的損害一定更知道得多一些吧！鼠，不但要噬壞衣服　物，它還有造成火災，帶給人類疫病的可能。假使只以老鼠給人們的損失，在金錢方面來算，那末全國的損失少不得要以萬計，性命的傷害，疾病的痛苦還是除外的呢！</p>
<p>可是，就民間的一般人來說，他們對老鼠幾乎只有盲目的尊敬。譬如，一件物事被老鼠齒毀了，他們只是自認倒霉，決不想說些什麼的；有時例外地說了，對「老鼠」兩個字也總是諱着的；因爲據他們的意思，假使把損壞物件的罪名加在「鼠伯伯」的頭上，那末「鼠伯伯」殺起火來會給他們更大的損失呢。這種對老鼠敬而遠之的態度簡直使人摸不着頭腦。</p>
<p>分析所以對老鼠這種「敬」的態　，我想無非是爲了「奈何它不得」。因爲夜間正是人們淸夢的時候，誰高興整夜不眠來干涉老鼠的行動呢？一到日裏，它躱進了洞，要干涉也無從干涉起了。在這種情形下，於是一般人就只是讓老鼠採取自由行動，在心裏只是祈禱着老鼠不要給他們太多的損害而巳！其實，老鼠那裹懂得你的誠意呵！</p>
<p>生物始終是在競爭着的，失敗的就得減絕。大家對老鼠應有根本的認識，鼓起勇氣來和它們作戰。讀、擴大滅鼠運動」後</p>
<h3>路有凍死骨</h3>
<p>— 寒儒</p>
<p>初冬底一個晚上，北風刮得很利害，冰冷死寂的星加坡路上，一大堆人　集在　　典當門口。</p>
<p>「好啦！死屍末扛掉，拿出二十塊錢來，否則末仍舊拖進來！」一個穿了黑色制服的「警士」向典當裏的夥計們開條斧。（原來一班流氓串通了幾個「警察」，從馬路裹拖了一個死屍來橫在典當門檻上，預備敲一筆竹槓。）</p>
<p>「老鄉，幫幫忙，我們老　不在這裏，我們不能作主。」其中一個店夥向那「警士」求情。</p>
<p>「赫！你眞勿識相！弄脫二十塊錢末，馬馬虎虎，你媽媽！」個帽子歪戴身上披着馬褲呢大衣的說着一口江北話，眼睛向着那夥計瞪了幾瞪，店堂裹幾個人祇是呆呆地望着</p>
<p>『去！去！有什麼好看？」一個尖銳底聲音衝進了一大堆人羣，大家稍些讓開些，那個人後面跟着兩個小癟三，顯然的，這個人是想來拖死屍的。</p>
<p>「死屍呢？」那人問着衆人</p>
<p>「你預備怎麽樣？」一個「警士」向那人問着。「拖掉末算啦。」</p>
<p>「那是不興！你跟我來。」那「警士」拉他到無人之處。</p>
<p>「怎麼啦？敲竹槓嗎？』「王八蛋敲竹摃，這二十塊錢，日「崗位」上的主意，我兄弟不拿你一個錢。」</p>
<p>「二十塊錢就乾凈了嗎？」</p>
<p>「是啊！快－些噢。」</p>
<p>那個人隨卽給了「警士」二十塊錢。霎時間幾個「警士」忙了一回，五六個流氓拿繩子的拿繩子，拿爐灰的爐灰，把死屍捲好，於是大家一哄而散。誰知事情卻還沒有完啦，那個「警士」又開始向典當裏伸手了</p>
<p>「好啦！沒有事咧，崗位上幾個人…。」</p>
<p>「你不是說二十元統統在內，還有什崗位不崗位，我問你，他們是站崗的還是敲詐的？」</p>
<p>「老朋友不是這樣說的，他們每個人賺幾塊錢，吃飯也不够，你想好啦。」</p>
<p>「呵！這眞是……。」</p>
<p>於是又是五元，這樣，事情才算完了。典當裏化去了一十五塊錢，石頭門檻上給長錠燒得黑黝黝地，其他似乎找勿出什痕跡，他們就打烊了。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十二章　報告和解釋</p>
<p>霍桑照著我說道：「包朗，你總還記得　蘭臥室中壁廚裹的那變黑紋皮皮鞋，曾經抹試過的嗎？原來這塊手巾有過兩種功用：一種是抹刀，一種是抹皮鞋，」他把這刀照樣包好，放在倪金壽的書桌面上。「松泉，你說下去。」</p>
<p>那探夥點了點頭，繼續說道：「我從那小弄裹回出來時，老人已去過了好幾個門面，那兩個可疑人却已接近老人，我倒反而落在那兩個人的後面。但我爲着小心起見，又不便搶到他們的前面去。可是老人走到了一個郵局的鬥前，走了進去，那兩個人也就在門外徘徊。我虽然也不能跟進去。這樣躭擱了二十分鐘的光景，老人從郵局裏出來，那兩個人仍緊緊跟着。我沒有辦法，依舊落在後面。老人繼續步行，一直向大同路進行。進了大同路以後，我們四個人仍舊維持着先前的次序。我知道這兩個人不懷好意。我打算到了靑蒲路，讓老人進了屋子，我再解決這兩個人。不料將近到靑蒲路轉角，那兩個人忽上前動手，目的分明要行刦。那時我離開他們還有三四丈路，我正想上前去干涉，那三個人扭了一回，忽兒兩聲槍響，老人就倒在轉角上。那兩個人也回身奔逃。這兩個人和我擦身而過。我如果阻攔，至少可以擒住一個人。但這兩個人旣不曾注意我，我就定意索性尾隨他們去，也許可以得到更好的成績。他們在大同路北面的轉角上，僱着了兩輛黃包車。我當然也坐了車子追踪。直到西區文廟路附近，他們才下車，走進一宅沒有門牌的草屋中去。</p>
<p>「我認明了地點，便到附近西區警署裏去報告。楊區長馬上派了四個弟兄，帶了手槍，跟我到那草屋中去，我們進了茅屋，那兩個人還在裏面，那穿西裝的一個，拔出手槍來要想抵抗。但我們的手快，他已來不及。所以我們小曾費多大氣力，一共捉住了四個人，一個女人，三個男人。</p>
<p>「我們把這四個人帶回到西區警署，楊區長馬上向這四個人問供。起先他們當然還不肯說，後來經過了一次小小的麻煩，那個西裝的才說出實話。他們的目的很簡單。他們瞧見那老頭兒在珠寳店裹換得了許多鈔票，便想刧取。不過結果却沒有成功，費了兩粒子彈，讓那老人吃些苦罷了。」</p>
<p>霍桑聽到這裏，點r幾點頭，表示他對於這報告非常滿意。（一八〇）</p>
<h3>夢和夢</h3>
<p>— 蘇農</p>
<p>李大嫂昨夜又做了夢，所以一淸早起來就興冲冲地去「報告」給隔壁的張師母聽：「張師母！告訴你一件喜事，我昨天晚上做了同樣地兩個夢：看見屋子裏充滿了火光，並且有許許多多老鼠從火光裹跳出來，曖，你看打「伏桑」怎麼樣？J</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？怪不得看見你臉上滿是紅光，你不是夢見火光嗎？火是紅的，紅是發財的「兆頭」啊！老鼠，對，對，打）伏桑」！一定著！一定！」張師母竭力從恿著說。因爲她知道，參加了意見總能够揩得點「油」的。</p>
<p>「那末，就一準打它一塊錢，著了請你客！」</p>
<p>張師母一聽說「請客」，先就眉飛色舞起來，「我說是包著的，李大嫂，請我什麽啊？」</p>
<p>「請你吃蟹怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>「好，好！但眞不好意思，又：」她像是已經吃到了蟹似地，想像著怎樣用蟹的小腿的尖端去剔出一塊蟹黃，然後向酷裏浸一浸，然後……她嚥了一口涎沫。</p>
<p>於是在李大嫂袋袋裏僅有的一塊錢就立刻「飛」到了「小麻子」手裹。因爲遲了就怕趕不上「早筒」。</p>
<p>「小麻子」是這條弄堂裹誰都知道的「花會跑街」。他司以從贏的那兒拿到一些「紅利」；輸了呢，那自然是不管他事！</p>
<p>張師母索性挨在李大嫂房裹等蟹吃了。李大嫂却在「計劃」著除了一半請客以外怎樣去受用另一半的錢，他想買幾方手帕，買一件衣料：又想買兩斤肉，好好兒燒上一大鍋子飯吃個飽；又想買……</p>
<p>李大嫂笑了。張師母也笑了。</p>
<p>幾分鐘以後，似乎有一種熟習的脚步聲在挨近來，進屋子了！</p>
<p>她們的心立刻就緊張起來：是渴望，是恐懼。</p>
<p>但是，「小麻子」的頭總於探了進來，說：「李太太，開「合同」」又很快地縮出去了。</p>
<p>李大嫂斗地站起來罵著，「死老鼠，瘟老鼠！倒來作弄我！下次看見了非殺盡它不可！』於是。•剛剛的什麽手帕，衣料，肉，大鍋的飯……都化作了夢。</p>
<p>她頹喪地翻開箱子，從裹面拿出一件衣服來，當然，停一會兒是會安躺在「保險庫」裏的。</p>
<p>張師母呢？也像是做了個「吃蟹夢」。她沒精打彩地唏噓著：『早知道，一塊錢也够買兩隻蟹！」她小禁叉嚥了口涎沫。李大嫂息著。張師母也嘆息著……</p>
<p>『下次做了夢不可以對我說：…」最後張師母向李大嫂這樣「警告」。</p>

<h3>Ongoing Talks in Washington: US Determined to Vigorously Aid China; Jones Declares China Needs New Loans; US Labor Unions Reaffirm Determination to Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Washington - Jones, Chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, stated yesterday that the United States should consider providing more assistance to China, but no definite decision has been made yet. Jones stated, "The more difficult China's situation becomes, the more we hope to do everything in our power to help." He added that the amount of the loan has not yet been discussed. Jones's remarks were made amid rumors of new loans to China. These rumors gained momentum on Tuesday when Ambassador Hu and Song Ziwen met with Secretary of State Hull. However, after the meeting, officials stated that no new loans to China were discussed. Treasury officials also said they had not heard of the rumored new loan. However, Jones acknowledged that Chinese officials here "need more loans." Jones stated that the United States would be willing to purchase as many goods as possible from China to facilitate the repayment of Chinese loans to the United States. Chairman Jones stated that talks with the Chinese side are ongoing, and the Chinese side has expressed its desire to obtain "more loans." Jones indicated that China's wishes are receiving a favorable response because of the very satisfactory previous transactions between China and the United States. China is currently continuing to fulfill its obligations to transport tung oil, tin, and other goods. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Northern Chinese Troops in Sui County Triumphantly Return; Recover Lishan and Jingmingpu; Japanese Troops at Jinji Ridge Retreat Southward; Chinese Corps Surround Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Fancheng - The Japanese on the Xianghua Road front in northern Hubei again circled around to Jingmingpu, where they were annihilated by the Chinese army. On the 26th, the Chinese army captured Jingmingpu, and then took advantage of the victory to continue to capture Kuaihuoling. At dawn on the 27th, the Chinese attacked the vicinity of Lishan, and the Japanese were again defeated by the Chinese. At 3:00 PM, Lishan was recovered, and the Japanese at Jinji Ridge also retreated southward. Currently, the Chinese armies are encircling the defeated Japanese for a painful strike. The Japanese, under attack from both the front and rear, were unable to withstand the retreat. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Zaoyang - The Japanese who invaded the western foot of Dabong Mountain from the vicinity of Zhongxiang were severely damaged by the Chinese army near Changshou Store. The Japanese repeatedly reinforced and attacked fiercely but were bravely repelled by the Chinese army. As of the morning of the 27th, the fighting was still ongoing. (Dispatch of the 28th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Chinese army recently told the press that the extensive offensive of the Japanese army in Hubei Province is merely to drive its air force to attack the locations of a small number of Chinese troops, in order to reduce China's military strength and equipment, and to occupy places from time to time. The spokesperson said that the Japanese army does not currently want to launch a major general offensive in an attempt to occupy new land, as this tactic requires a large amount of manpower and financial resources, which the Japanese army may not have at this time. In the recent battles in Hubei Province, the Japanese army cannot hope to gain anything, because at this time the Japanese army only has one or two divisions to deal with a 150-kilometer front line. The spokesperson pointed out that the Japanese army is currently acting in the same way as they previously occupied Shaoxing and Zhuji, and the result will definitely not be beneficial. The current attack by the Japanese army is the third attempt by the Japanese army in Hubei Province since the start of the war, but the previous two attacks used no less than five divisions of troops, and their momentum was far more terrifying than the current attack. Since the first two have failed, this one will undoubtedly fail as well. The spokesperson also said that the Japanese army launched a fierce attack from Sui County in northern Hubei towards Lishan on Monday, but was driven back to Kuihe Ridge (transliteration) west of Sui County the next day. Another Japanese team attacked north from the area between Yichang and Dangyang but was blocked at Lexiangguan near Dangyang. The Japanese troops who invaded the east bank of the Hanshui River from Zhongxiang were also repelled. The Chinese army had a good harvest in the previous week, recovering Mengcheng in northern Anhui on November 19th, and recovering Zhizhi at the junction of Anhui and Jiangxi last night. In North China, there have also been fierce battles in Jin Province since November 10th. The Japanese army concentrated its attack on Yushe, 100 kilometers southeast of Taiyuan, but the city is still in the hands of the Chinese army. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Military Celebration - Reports from the front line in Hubei confirm the news of the renewed battle between the Chinese and Japanese armies on the east bank of the Hanshui River, saying that on the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, the Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery units on the east bank of the Hanshui River attacked the Chinese army's positions near Changshou Store, north of Zhongxiang.

More than 2,000 Japanese troops on the east side of the Xiang River launched a fierce attack northward from Zhongxiang and engaged in mixed combat with the Chinese army. About 4,000 Japanese troops on the west side of the Xiang River attacked from Jingmen and engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the area near Lexiangguan. The Japanese offensive was frustrated. (Dispatch of the 27th)</p>
<p>Pingjiang - The Japanese troops in Chongyang and Baini Bridge advanced towards Qingshankou, Dashi, and Xianshiyan in the area south of the highway on the morning of the 27th.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>What Will America Do?</h3>
<p>The remarks made by US Secretary of State Hull and others after Japan appointed former Foreign Minister Admiral Nomura Kichisaburo as ambassador to the United States, such as saying that everyone knows the US position in advocating that international relations should be based on law; and that Nomura must be able to ensure that Japan's policy in China does not contradict his statement that all countries in the East must continue to have free and unrestricted exchanges with other countries; and that Japan's actions speak louder than its words, hitting people's eardrums; and that if Japan wants to improve its relationship with the United States, it must fundamentally change its policies, and merely changing the ambassador to the United States will not help; these views are sufficient to prove that the United States has a thorough understanding of the Sino-Japanese problem and a firm and stable Far East policy. At the same time, although Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shi and President of the Bank of China Song Ziwen kept the contents of their meeting with Hull yesterday secret, according to Jones, Chairman of the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the United States is considering providing more assistance to China. The more difficult China's situation becomes, the more we hope to do everything in our power to help. He also said that China's desire to obtain more assistance is gaining a favorable response in the United States because the previous transactions between China and the United States were extremely satisfactory. Comparing the attitudes of the United States towards China and Japan, we can see that although the future of the Pacific is cloudy, it is also in the midst of a battle between light and darkness. This is further evidenced by the opinions in Tokyo that Nomura should be encouraged, all of which say that US-Japan relations are extremely bad and Nomura's mission is extremely difficult, indicating that the Japanese are outwardly strong but inwardly weak and not very confident.</p>
<p>Among the above, although we feel that there are reassuring elements that are helpful to the overall situation, it is not enough to accelerate its effectiveness in curbing aggression and stabilizing the Far East. As early as fourteen months ago, the Japanese authorities were eager to adjust Japanese-American relations, so they scouted for Nomura, who "had studied at the US Naval Academy, served as a naval attache at the US Embassy in the United States, and was one of the Japanese representatives at the Washington Conference, and knew many people in the US government and public," to be the Foreign Minister. They thought that he would be able to deal with the United States. At that time, we once pointed out that "the crux of the US is the fundamental contradiction of national policy; that is, the United States is committed to maintaining the civilized principles of mankind, maintaining the principles of international justice, and maintaining the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, while Japan is destroying what the United States wants to maintain by force. The contradiction goes beyond diplomacy and lies in the realm of politics, which cannot be eliminated by the talents of the Foreign Minister; to say that the traditional national policy of a foreign country will be changed by the talents of the Foreign Minister is absolutely impossible, so how can Nomura adjust it? To adjust the US-Japan situation, Japan must give up its aggression, otherwise all efforts will be in vain; observing that the Japanese leaders do not correct their own actions but only blame the Foreign Minister, it can be seen that the Japanese leaders have failed to understand the crux of the matter." Nomura ultimately achieved nothing and resigned in frustration. More than a year has passed, and one can no longer imagine that the Japanese government and public have not seen through the crux of the US-Japan situation; therefore, Japan initially had high expectations for Nomura's tenure as Foreign Minister, but now the encouragement for him to be the US envoy is no longer the same. It can be seen that Japan's attitude towards the United States is, on the one hand, to do its best regardless of success or failure, without expecting anything; on the other hand, to maintain the formal normality of diplomatic relations with the United States, not to keep the envoys away, but to deceive the eyes and ears and cover up other activities, in order to gain time and space that are beneficial to itself. What the United States has expressed about Nomura's mission to the United States is completely consistent with what we discussed fourteen months ago: it is sufficient to show that the crux of the matter remains the same, and it also shows that although the US attitude is extremely firm and has made Japan aware of US assessment, it has still failed to effectively correct the phenomenon of the past year. This is something that anyone cannot help but feel is not enough. As for US aid to China, Jones's words are extremely far-reaching; and the meeting between the Chinese Hu and Song and Hull was certainly not just empty talk. The contents of the contact are naturally not clear to outsiders, but judging from the signs alone, the United States is extremely satisfied with its dealings with China, as Jones said. As for the United States' aid to Britain, as George, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in yesterday's Reuters Washington dispatch, any move to expand financial assistance must first have an investigation into British resources; originally, any assistance must have its corresponding value, but given the current international situation and its chaotic nature, the United States' aid to China and Britain is based only on the satisfaction of transactions and the investigation of resources as the basis for consideration, and such a scope of consideration must also be felt by anyone to be insufficient. Japan did not interrupt its oppression because the United States advocated maintaining the status quo in Vietnam, and finally signed the Vietnam Agreement with the French, acquiring Hanoi and Haiphong as bases. The past is not far away and can serve as a warning, and according to last night's news, the French made a deeper step of humiliating compromise, and Vichy directly allowed Japan to open a Japanese air base in Saigon. One leap after another, advancing south and then south, Saigon is another thousand miles south of Hanoi and Haiphong. Is this ultimately to deal with China and get closer to the Yunnan-Burma Road? It goes against the grain, geographically not at all. The Japanese have already taken advantage of the weakest link in the international community, advancing fiercely along the French Vietnamese coast, and now they have detoured and circled to the southwest of the Philippines. From Saigon, only 650 miles remain from the Singapore naval base operated by Britain and borrowed by the United States! How should American officials address these serious phenomena, based on a firm policy? Reconsider its actions and take effective measures as soon as possible?</p>
<h3>Japan Establishes Air Base in Saigon; Has Obtained Permission from Vichy Government; Japanese Aircraft Constantly Fly Over Hanoi</h3>
<p>London - Officials learned yesterday that Japan has repeatedly established an air base in Saigon. This move will not only bring Japan's air power closer to the Yunnan-Burma Road, but also closer to the territories of the United Kingdom and the United States between Vietnam and the Philippines.

<p>Tokyo - The Finance Director of Vietnam told the Hanoi correspondent of Yomiuri Shimbun yesterday that Vietnam's inventory can last until July next year, but at that time, chemical supplies and national defense needs must be imported. At the same time, the export of rubber, grains, and tin ore must be increased. Since economic relations with France have been severed, Vietnam will break away from France's trade restrictions and increase exports. Therefore, economic cooperation with Japan is necessary.

<p>Vichy - The Vichy government announced that the war between Vietnam and Thailand began on the 23rd. French troops repelled Thai troops who were crossing a pontoon bridge on the Gostang River (transliteration) three times on the Cambodian border. The Vichy government reiterated its determination to protect the integrity of the colony. If the other side uses a peaceful negotiation method, Vichy is also happy to discuss Thailand's demands with Thailand. It is said that the number of reserve troops in French Vietnam is quite large, enough to defend the integrity of the territory, but the Thai air force has a significant advantage because it recently received many American aircraft. The French government still hopes that Thailand will ratify the mutual non-aggression treaty agreed upon by France and Thailand on June 12. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Jiang Jieshi Attends to Sichuan Province Rice Shortage; Orders County Magistrates to Quickly Devise Solutions</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Local newspapers recently reported that Chairman Jiang has instructed the twenty county magistrates of Sichuan Province to quickly assist in resolving the rice panic. He instructed the county magistrates to inform local landlords and wealthy families that it is their natural duty to supply rice to the people and the military at fair prices. If landlords and others object, the county magistrates should directly report the names of five or ten hoarders within ten days, and then take appropriate measures to deal with them. Reports state that areas in the western region with abundant rice production, such as Chengdu, are also reluctant to supply rice to the military. According to the Ta Kung Pao, the price of rice in Chengdu has fallen below 100 yuan per dan (unit of weight), and further declines are expected. The price of rice in Chongqing has fallen from 180 yuan per dan to 135 yuan per dan during this period. Authoritative sources also stated that there is no shortage of production at present, and the rise in rice prices is purely due to speculation. As the cost of living increases, so will labor costs. Last winter, the price of rice consumed by each person per day was only five jiao (unit of currency), but now it costs two yuan per person per day. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Japan Purchases Military Supplies and Raw Materials in Hong Kong; Tungsten and Gallnuts Purchased in Large Quantities; Hong Kong Government Does Not Prohibit Shipment to Japan</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Since the United States embargoed scrap iron and other war materials, Japan has been purchasing large quantities of tungsten sand, scrap iron, and gallnuts in Hong Kong. Gallnuts are an essential raw material for the manufacture of incendiary bombs, and their prices are also lower than in other parts of the world. Japanese merchants are now eagerly stockpiling tungsten sand, preparing to use it to manufacture heavy military equipment in Japan. The export of tungsten is currently controlled by the Hong Kong government, fearing that it will be shipped to Germany, but does not prohibit its shipment to Japan, and then re-shipped to Germany, because Japan needs all of Hong Kong's tungsten and cannot transfer it to Germany. Although the Chongqing authorities prohibit the export of tungsten, a large amount of tungsten sand is still smuggled from Guangdong Province, which is occupied by Japan, to Hong Kong. Smugglers pay considerable protection fees in the occupied areas and can transport it to Hong Kong Island. The Beijiang, Dongjiang, Xijiang, and southern Jiangxi Province on the border of Guangdong Province are all tungsten-producing areas. All tungsten sand must be transported to Hong Kong Island and then shipped to various parts of the world. The United States often purchases tungsten sand from the Chinese government, paying for it to repay credit loans. Another major customer for tungsten is the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union exchanges military equipment and warplanes for China's tungsten sand. Now Japan is sharing a portion of the tungsten from Guangdong, which is due to the smugglers. Trade between Japan and Hong Kong is booming because Japanese goods are cheap and suitable for use in the interior. Theoretically, Japan does not sell its goods to Free China, but this is only a paper prohibition. Japanese goods are first stripped of their labels in Shanghai and Hong Kong and then transported from Shandong. A portion of the Japanese goods is routed through Shau Kei Wan, and most are routed through Lubao to Shaoguan. Another portion of Japanese goods is transported to Shantou and smuggled to the Dongjiang area, north to northern Guangdong and southern Jiangxi. Although general business in Hong Kong is currently declining, Japanese exporters and importers of Japanese goods are making ten times their profits. (International News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Southern Ohrid Lake Bank, Struga: Yesterday, the perilous situation of the Italian army in Albania increased every hour. The Greek army advanced on all sides. The Italian army's resistance seemed more organized than before, leading to widespread rumors that the Italian commander General Badoglio had established a general headquarters in Tirana, the capital of Albania. This is sufficient to indicate the desperate position of the Italian army. In the town of Moscopole, the Italian army launched two strong counter-offensives, but after an hour of fierce fighting, they were both repelled by the Greek army. From Pogradec to the Kavala Sein road, British planes dropped bombs all day yesterday, killing and wounding many Italian soldiers. The Greek army has occupied the village of Delaftika, but 72 were killed and 50 wounded. As a result, the Greek army advanced ten kilometers in this area yesterday. Nine British and Greek aircraft bombed the extremely important Durazzo port in three batches. Gasoline warehouses and houses there caught fire. The battle of Argyrokastro seems to be concentrated in the mountains to the northwest. It is rumored that the Greek army has advanced within two miles of the city, while another account claims that the Greek army has captured it. However, all parties say that the Italian army has begun to withdraw from the city and is building strong positions in the mountains. General Soto, the Italian Undersecretary of the Army, has reportedly ordered that Argyrokastro be defended to the last man. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>

It was recently learned from reliable sources that a unit of the Italian army was detained in Yugoslavia after crossing the border between Lake Maligrad and Lake Ohrid. The Ministry of War's intelligence stated that the Greek Air Force bombed Italian concentration points in Albania yesterday, while Italian aircraft bombed villages in Epirus, Corfu, Cephalonia, and Crete, as well as the Greek port of Patras. The Royal Air Force Command stated that British and Greek aircraft made a "highly successful raid" on Valona on Tuesday. (Taiwan Public Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Greek Army Continues to Advance Along the Entire Front, Breaking Through the New Italian Front Line</p>
<p>London: Athens Radio stated that the Greek army, which is continuing to advance along the entire front, has broken through the new Italian front line at various points. At the same time, serious turmoil has occurred near Elbasan, making it difficult for the Italian army to cope. The Greek army has now penetrated deep into Albanian territory, and its right wing has advanced north beyond Pogradec. The position of its artillery is ingenious and its firepower is accurate, preventing the Italian army from retreating, transporting supplies and war equipment. Among the recent spoils captured by the Greek army are six Italian trains abandoned by the Italian army. The Italian army is now digging trenches on both banks of the Chairo River near Pogradec to defend it. A major battle is expected in the area soon. Italian reinforcements, including many dive bombers, are rushing to the front. At the same time, Italian aircraft are bombing villages in the Epirus region and non-military targets on the islands of Corfu and Cephalonia.

The town of Lephri on the island of Cephalonia was bombed, causing some civilian casualties. The battle of Argyrokastro now seems to be concentrated in the mountains to the northwest.

<p>Athens: Today's front-line war report stated that the Italian army, under Mussolini's order to "defend to the death," strengthened its bridal procession last night and fought fiercely along the entire three front lines in Albania, its tenacity being unprecedented in the month since the start of the Italo-Greek War. Although the Italian army launched this death-defying battle, which was too late, the latest news said that the Greek army was still advancing bravely and deeply into Albania. According to intelligence arriving in Athens, after General Badoglio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, came to Albania to supervise the war, the Italian front lines in the areas of Argyrokastro, Moscopole, and Lake Ohrid have been corrected. According to reports, General Badoglio will go to Tirana to command the Italian counter-offensive on Monday. More than two weeks ago, when the Italian offensive began to falter, General Soto was appointed as the commander-in-chief of the Italian army invading Greece, but now Badoglio has clearly taken over Soto's position. At the same time, it is learned that British aircraft recently bombed the vital port of Durazzo, turning it into ruins and forcing General Badoglio to lead his two divisions of reinforcements into Albania through a port further north of Durazzo. According to Greek sources, the Greek army occupied the strategically important village of Tsiraicho in the Pogradec area during a terrible artillery battle. It also said that the Greek army had made progress in the central region, repelling a fierce Italian counter-offensive north of Moscopole. (International Dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Fierce Air Battles Between British and Italian Air Forces in Italian-Controlled Africa; British Aircraft Attack Benghazi with Considerable Success</h3>

The British aircraft stationed there had launched more than 100 attacks without losing a single aircraft or person. Every night when the full moon rose, the bombers took off one after another to fly to Ethiopia, returning together at dawn. One of the aircraft was unable to release one of the two wheels on its belly when it returned to the airfield, so the pilot landed safely using only one wheel, with only minor damage to the fuselage. The airfield had been bombed by Italian aircraft, but the British aircraft and the airfield were undamaged. The airfield's air defenses are now very strong, and recently, whirlwind-type British fighters arrived in the Western Desert, which were very popular. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Dutch Food Depleted by Looting</h3>
<p>London: The Nazis are systematically seizing Dutch food and labor, resulting in a higher standard of living for the Germans than in other occupied areas, and there are fears that this will continue to increase. Three-quarters of Dutch railway vehicles have been transported to Germany. Coupled with the British Air Force's disruption of transportation, Dutch transportation is extremely difficult. Of the at least 8,000 tons of butter stored in the Netherlands, ninety percent had been transported away within the first week of the German occupation. The number of poultry has decreased from 28 million to 6 million, and all pigs have been slaughtered. Even a quarter of the Dutch dairy cows have been slaughtered. Now, the Dutch radio station controlled by the Germans even says that eating eggs for breakfast is an unnecessary luxury, and that abolishing tea and coffee will definitely be beneficial to health. Dutch housewives are currently lacking oil, as they can only receive half a liter of oil every six months. (November 28th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>French and Swiss Newspapers Reveal Inside Story of Soviet-German Talks: Maintain the Status Quo of Black Sea Coastal States</h3>
<p>Lyon, France: The City Times recently published a telegram from its correspondent in the capital of Yugoslavia, revealing the results of the recent visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Berlin. The main points are as follows: (1) The Soviet Union is considering signing a non-aggression pact with Japan. (2) The new European organization proposed by Germany can be approved by the Soviet Union. (3) Germany will avoid and not support any actions that may harm the interests of the Soviet Union in the Dardanelles and Bosporus Straits. (4) Germany recognizes the current borders between the Soviet Union and Finland as immutable. (5) The Soviet Union and Germany will continue negotiations in Moscow. Apart from this, all actions of the Axis powers in the Balkan Peninsula can be considered as expressing Soviet consent. (November 27th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Zurich: The New Chatelais Gazette's correspondent in Stamboul telegraphed further revelations about the inside story of the recent Soviet-German talks in Berlin. It is claimed that if Germany had a plan to invade Palestine and Egypt through Asia Minor and the Dardanelles, it must have been abandoned due to Soviet opposition. Moscow does not recognize the existence of the Axis group. Molotov only discussed issues related to the Soviet Union and Germany with Germany. Although the issues of the Near East and Central Asia were not mentioned, Molotov made it clear that the status quo of the Dardanelles and the Black Sea coastal states must be maintained. Moscow will have nothing to do with the Tripartite Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan. The Soviet government, shortly after the conclusion of the pact, declared its attitude towards the pact and told the Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union that it had decided to continue assisting General Chiang Kai-shek. The first thing Molotov did after returning to Moscow from Berlin was to deny the rumor circulated by a British newspaper that the Soviet Union and Japan would conclude an agreement that included the condition that the Soviet Union would stop aiding China. Although Soviet-British relations are quite cold at present, the Soviet Union has decided to maintain its existing neutrality and will not unite with anyone to deal with Britain under any circumstances.

<p>London: According to absolutely reliable news from Vichy obtained by a special correspondent of the Free French News Agency, opinions differed within the Vichy cabinet when it met to discuss Hitler's peace terms for France, with Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval and French armistice representative General Huntsinger nearly coming to blows. Finally, it was decided to reject Hitler's terms. The terms brought by Laval from Paris were: (1) Cession of Alsace-Lorraine; (2) Monthly release of 100,000 French prisoners of war, with the last batch to be released within two years; (3) No territory to be ceded to Italy except for Djibouti, but French domestic and colonial ports would be available for German ships to dock and procure supplies. General Huntsinger, an Alsatian, strongly opposed the last term, pointing out that this was a trap to drag France into the war against Britain, and that Germany's real goal was to prove that Germany was not as powerful as it claimed to be. Laval, who secretly plotted to help Germany attack Britain and had obtained the support of Naval Minister Darlan, strongly refuted General Huntsinger's views. The two sides engaged in a verbal battle that nearly turned into a fistfight, but after three cabinet meetings, Laval finally failed. As a result, General Petain did not mention the terms of the peace treaty in his broadcast at the end of October. After this, Hitler forcibly expelled the French from Lorraine Province. Hearing that Hitler was preparing to sacrifice Italian demands in exchange for the use of French ports, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini prematurely launched an attack on Greece.

<h3>Internal Unrest in Romania After Massacre; Army Generals Resign; Romanian Government Investigates Perpetrators</h3>
<p>Bucharest: After the gruesome massacre of 64 political enemies of the pro-German Iron Guard in Romania, revolutionary actions seem imminent. Romanian dictator Prime Minister Antonescu has taken stern measures yesterday to crush this impending action. In an effort to prevent internal strife, the Romanian government has persuaded the army and the Iron Guard to abandon their past resentments. The hatred between the two sides, which is nearing the breaking point, is well known. When the 64 Romanian government leaders who were shot were lined up and executed at the graves of three deceased Iron Guard members, the crowd watched in breathless silence. In this scene of "Balkan Vendetta," the corpses of the 64 people were still lying on the graves this morning. These 13 people were allegedly involved in a plot to overthrow the government of the deposed King Carol two years ago and were killed. Iron Guard leader Codreanu was also among them. At the same time, it was also heard that the Iron Guard yesterday again demanded the extradition of Carol's mistress, Lupescu. They believed that the mistress was responsible for the killing of the 13 Iron Guard members. This red-haired mistress, for whom King Carol once abandoned the throne because he was in love with her, is now rumored to be living with him in Spain. It is claimed that the Iron Guard wants the mistress to return to Romania to "stand trial." After yesterday's massacre, the Fascist Party issued a warning that the killings had not stopped. Therefore, General Antonescu quickly took drastic measures to prevent the outbreak of chaos. Although Antonescu will convene an emergency cabinet meeting to discuss "how to deal with the Iron Guard's anarchic actions," the murderers may still escape justice, as the method of punishing the murderers has not yet been decided. It is rumored that Antonescu is quite afraid that this move will cause internal unrest. (November 28th, International News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Bucharest: The curtain has fallen on one of the greatest tragedies of revenge in Romanian history. The remains of Colonel Codreanu, the leader of the Romanian Iron Guard who was killed two years ago, and 13 Iron Guard members, were moved last night to the altar of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral. These remains of the Iron Guard members were transported to the church after 64 political leaders from the former King's era were murdered by Iron Guard members in the courtyard of the Gilaeva military prison, the same place where Codreanu and his followers were executed in 1938. After the officials of the former King's era were killed, the Iron Guard leader issued a public statement calling on Iron Guard members across the country to maintain party discipline. Members of the Romanian Cabinet also declared that severe punishment would be imposed on those who carried out the massacre. Romanian newspapers and radio stations did not publish news of this mass execution. Only the official newspapers this morning published a public statement from the cabinet meeting. The Iron Guard has now taken over the church where the remains of the Iron Guard members are placed. In addition to calling on Iron Guard members across Romania to maintain order and discipline, the Iron Guard and political public statements also stated that "anyone who violates discipline is a traitor and should be severely punished." In addition, there was a public statement guaranteeing that the Romanian Iron Guard would be loyal to Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu. News about the arrest of former Prime Minister Aquitonian Geik was denied by senior officials. Some people said that there must still be killings in various parts of Romania. As for the news of the killing of other people, there is no official confirmation. Because when Codreanu was killed, hundreds of Iron Guard members in various parts of Romania were also killed. (November 28th, United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Bucharest: The Romanian government issued the following official gazette last night, stating that according to Prime Minister Antonescu's declaration, when the government ordered the excavation of the bodies of the assassinated members of the Legion in Gilaeva on the night of November 26, the Legion members in the area suddenly mutinied, broke into the prison, and arbitrarily opened fire on political prisoners involved in the case. Such actions are deeply disapproved of by the Prime Minister and the Romanian Legion. The Legion is prepared to hand over the perpetrators to the government for prosecution. Any such illegal actions in the future will be severely punished. At the same time, State Councillor and Legion Leader Siama also issued a circular, ordering all members to abide by the law and discipline, and those who violate it will be severely punished. (November 28th, Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu issued a long article last night, expressing dissatisfaction with the unexpected incident in Gilaeva. Iron Guard Leader Siama also issued a declaration, calling on the Legionnaires to support General Antonescu. According to well-informed sources, the Gilaeva incident did not affect the government's position. (November 28th, Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Bucharest: 64 political prisoners in the Gilaeva military prison in Romania have been killed. The State Council met at 11:00 a.m., with Antonescu presiding. Siama also went to the police station in the morning to investigate the truth. Antonescu and Siama were not informed of the Iron Guard's killing of political prisoners. The Iron Guard members were probably worried that the political prisoners who sentenced the former Iron Guard leader Kadlianu to death might be released, so they took direct action. Former Prime Minister Yuga was released in the afternoon after being arrested. (November 28th, Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Bucharest: After the Romanian Iron Guard shot 64 political enemies in the early morning yesterday, the government took repressive measures to prevent the outbreak of internal unrest. However, yesterday evening, self-appointed gunmen from the Iron Guard continued their mad actions, killing more of their enemies in addition to the 64 people. Because Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu wanted to make an effort to prevent conflict between the army and the rebels, the Romanian regular army was ready for emergency action yesterday evening. After 64 former Romanian politicians were killed in the Gilaeva military prison, the Romanian army generals immediately submitted their resignations, but the army generals obeyed General Antonescu's orders to stop the possible rebellion. (November 28th, International Telegram)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Prominent Romanian officials who were arrested the night before, such as former Prime Minister Tatalescu, former cabinet members Aquitonian, Gairmeceanu, Gigudulic, and General Yasiovich, were released yesterday. The number of political prisoners shot yesterday is unknown, but according to reliable sources, former National Peasant Party Secretary-General Machianu has been shot. Machianu has been a cabinet member several times and is usually leftist. (November 28th, Haitong Telegram)</p>
<h3>Papen Assures Turkish Government That Germany Has No Intention of Attacking Turkey; Turkish President to Meet with Papen Today</h3>
<p>Angora: German Ambassador to Turkey Papen, after returning to his post, has assured the Turkish government that Germany has no intention of fighting in the Balkan Peninsula, let alone attacking Turkey. However, Turkish political circles believe that the Italian army's defeat in Greece has prompted this tone from Germany, otherwise the tone would be very different. The news received by Angora also said that the Soviet Union opposed continued disruptions to the peace in the Balkans. Germany's decision not to invade Turkey now was also prompted by the Soviet Union's attitude. (November 28th, Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>500 Paris Students Enter Concentration Camps; Paris University Closed</h3>
<p>London: According to news received by the Free French, 500 Paris students have been sent to concentration camps in Germany, and the rest have been driven to the unoccupied zone of France, because of recent incidents. Paris University has been closed. It is heard that the demonstration started on Armistice Day, November 11. The students formed a line, led by young people holding two wooden sticks. The French for "two wooden sticks" is "Deux Gaulese," which is pronounced the same as "de Gaulle," the leader of the Free French. The demonstrators tried to drive some Germans out of a famous cafe in Montparnasse, but German troops intervened and restored order. (November 28th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Croats in Yugoslavia Hold Demonstration</h3>
<p>Yugoslavian Capital: The Croatian Nationalist Party, which has been on good terms with the government authorities for several months, held a demonstration last night in Zagreb, with many party members marching through the streets, shouting "Down with Machek!"

They also threw explosives at several public telephone locations and fought with several Peasant Party members, resulting in multiple injuries. (November 27th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Relaxes Air Raids on Britain Due to Bad Weather; Suburbs of London Suffer Minor Damage; Plymouth Harbor Bombed</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command admitted today that after German aircraft inflicted incalculable damage on Coventry, Birmingham, Southampton, and Bristol, yesterday's Blitzkrieg on Britain was inevitably slowed down due to bad weather, with only reconnaissance flights and sporadic attacks. However, Avonmouth was still heavily bombed by German aircraft and caught fire. (November 28th, International Telegram)</p>
<p>London: A joint communique from the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security stated that the southwest of England and the suburbs of London were the focus of enemy aircraft activity last night. The town in the southwest was attacked after dusk and did not end until 1:30 a.m. The London air raid was intermittent throughout the night, but there was no large-scale attack. Houses and shops in the above-mentioned two places were damaged by bombs and incendiary bombs, but according to reports up to 5:00 a.m., the extent of the damage was not large, and there were few casualties. Bombs also fell elsewhere in the country, but the loss of materials and lives was very small. One enemy bomber was destroyed. (November 28th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin: The military construction in Plymouth Harbor was wildly bombed by German aircraft, with no less than 100 tons of bombs and no less than several thousand incendiary bombs dropped. Fires broke out in many places, lighting up the sky. Plymouth is one of the most important military ports in Britain, located in the English Channel, and the largest ships can navigate unimpeded. Near the port is the Mountbatten airfield, and there are coastal batteries with large cannons, heavily guarded. It is a major military town in the United Kingdom. The British suffered heavy losses in last night's attack. (November 28th, Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>London: Well-informed sources in London claimed that although the German Air Force's new strategy of night attacks on British industrial cities has damaged the British arms industry, it has not brought it to a standstill. The true extent of the damage suffered by the industrial zone is known only to a few officials. The general impression is that although the situation is not good, it is not critical.

<h3>Hungarian Foreign Minister Explains Diplomatic Stance; Willing to Strengthen Cooperation with Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Budapest: Hungarian Foreign Minister Csaky explained Hungary's diplomatic relations to the Hungarian National Assembly Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday, especially regarding Hungary's accession to the Tripartite Pact. Csaky pointed out that when the Tripartite Pact was announced, the government unanimously decided to begin negotiations on Hungary's accession to the pact without delay. Regarding this matter, the German Foreign Minister provided assurances to Hungary that if Hungary were invaded, the three signatory countries would definitely assist Hungary. However, on the other hand, if the three signatory countries were attacked by any country that has not yet participated in the war after Hungary's accession, Hungary must declare that it stands on the side of the three countries. After careful consideration, the Hungarian government decided that, given the expected benefits, Hungary decided to take the risk of joining the pact. Csaky then pointed out the various benefits of joining the pact and mentioned the purpose of the Tripartite Pact stated by the German Foreign Minister at the Belvedere Fortress on November 10, which does not include actions outside of Hungary's foreign policy. Csaky continued that although Hungary deeply believes that it will be better off united with Germany after it collapsed in 1918 for future hope, it would be better than associating with England and France. Looking at the fate of the six governments that fled to London can serve as a warning. Some people are satisfied that Greece has not been occupied by Italy, but it is still too early. Italy's military strength is enough to make some countries lower their heads and think carefully, and countries that are unwilling or unable to back down will ultimately suffer the consequences. Hungary is willing to maintain closer relations with Yugoslavia. Political and economic weakness in Yugoslavia is harmful to Hungary and not beneficial. Csaky firmly believes that if the strengths of all parties can be united, peace can be restored in the Balkans, or at least dangerous disturbances cannot invade Hungary's borders.

<h3>More European War Talks 24: Underground Life of Londoners</h3>
<p>For three months, the German air force has dropped no less than 50 million pounds of bombs on Britain. Aside from material losses, approximately 3,500 civilians have lost their lives. Naturally, London has suffered the most. However, the British people’s perseverance and fighting spirit are admirable. On the surface, London appears scarred and battered, but it is estimated that only one percent of the buildings have been damaged by bombing. As for the loss of life, the total number in three months is less than the number of people killed in traffic accidents in the United States in one month. Nevertheless, the constant bombing by German aircraft has greatly demoralized the public. One sleepless night can ruin three days of energy, let alone three consecutive months. It is understandable that people are weary.</p>
<p>The authorities are using every means of written propaganda to encourage morale and boost morale. The "London Express" once told the public, "If you can continue to work, then we can defeat Germany. If you cannot, then we will be defeated by them." These short sentences are concise and inspiring. The authorities also posted notices in prominent places, urging the people not to be discouraged and encouraging their spirit of sustained warfare. Recently, a notice was unearthed from a trench on the front line of the British army during the last war. That team of soldiers was ordered to hold their ground, not to leave without authorization, and wait for reinforcements. As a result, the entire team died. The order was signed by an Australian officer, and it read: (1) This stronghold must be held. Do not leave without authorization until reinforcements arrive. (2) Under no circumstances should the enemy succeed. (3) If you cannot hold this point alive, you must hold it in death. (4) Anyone who intends to surrender because of shell shock must still die here. (5) If one stronghold is held, the entire front line can be preserved.</p>
<p>Londoners often proudly show the world their spirit of "walking" to air raid shelters rather than "running" to air raid trenches. The authorities warned the people to prepare some drinking water to bring into the air raid shelters in case the main water pipes explode and they have no water to drink. They also told them to always turn off the gas pipes when leaving their homes. During air raids, most commercial firms, except for banks, continue to operate as usual. After jewelry stores are bombed, the owners often lead their staff to search for gems and diamonds in the rubble. Many people die from flying glass shards, which have the power of bullets.</p>
<p>The most frustrated people are the pregnant women in London, whose total number is around 50,000. There are also 100,000 mothers with infants who find it very troublesome to breastfeed and change diapers under the blackout. A London woman, Mrs. Foster, was in labor during the constant bombing by German aircraft. One day, she went into labor during an air raid. Her husband was out serving, and she could not find a doctor. Only an air raid warden was by her side. A bomb exploded 80 yards away, blowing away the roof and windows of her bedroom. The warden delivered her baby in the dark rubble, and a healthy baby was successfully born.</p>
<p>The new incendiary bombs dropped by German aircraft in London contain aluminum and iron oxide, and have a burning power of up to 4,000 degrees. After falling to the ground, they are difficult to extinguish. After the air raid is over, the debris is still burning on the ground. Some passers-by even light their cigarettes with it, or use it to warm their hands. It can be said that it is a waste of talent.</p>
<p>The following narrative is the experience of "Life" magazine and "New York Times" correspondents in London, [blank] Gliner and [blank] Mickey, on the night of September 18, when German aircraft raided London. Every word is a true account of being there, and it makes people shudder to read it:</p>
<p>Gliner: "At 7:45 PM, after collecting information about Churchill in the library reference department of the "Daily Express" building, I hired a streetcar to go home. The driver drove quickly, passing through the dark streets. He wanted to drive out of central London before the air raid alarm sounded. Our residence is in a quiet part of London, in a 17th-century ochre house. Before the war, this house was occupied by the movie star Charles Laughton. I was having dinner. Since the air raids started in London, the gas has been cut off, so I have been cooking with an electric stove. Suddenly, I heard German aircraft buzzing in the air, and anti-aircraft guns roaring. The whistling sound of bombs and the sound of explosions followed one another. The sound became louder and louder, and I decided to run down to the basement cellar to hide temporarily."</p>
<p>Mickey: "Before evening, I went to the cinema to watch the newsreel, and decided to have dinner in the fourth district, without returning home to eat. When I was eating scrambled eggs and drinking half a bottle of French wine, the waiter announced the night's 'Mona' (this is Londoners' nickname for air raid alarms. The lifting of the alarm is called 'Clara'). After I finished eating, I started to go home. The air was filled with the smell of gunpowder, and the anti-aircraft fire was so bright that I could read a newspaper in the middle of the road. During an air raid, there is no way to hail a cab, so I didn't bother wasting time, and just walked and ran toward home. When I encountered an explosive overhead, I jumped into someone's doorway to hide temporarily. Londoners call this way of walking 'doorway hopping'! As I was approaching the house, a red light suddenly appeared to the right, followed by a violent explosion. Because there was no doorway in the middle of the road to hide temporarily, I had to stand still. Nothing fell beside me, and I ran straight to the house. When I got home, I saw Gliner hiding in the basement, and the housekeeper was about to run out to greet her husband. When the sound of anti-aircraft guns stopped, I rushed upstairs to change into old clothes, preparing to lie in the basement. The housekeeper also followed upstairs to call her husband."

<h3>Food: Foreign Rice Still Arriving, Rice Prices Still Rising, Speculators Swarming the Rice Market, Manipulating People's Food Supply, Placing Conscience Outside Their Bellies, Those With Responsibilities Fail to Fulfill Their Duties</h3>
<p>Foreign rice arrived in Shanghai again yesterday, brought by Taikoo Company ships. The Jiangsu ship brought 1,450 bags from Hong Kong, the Taiyuan ship also brought 4,699 bags from Hong Kong, and the Guangdong ship brought 6,032 bags from Hong Kong. In addition, 3,635 bags were transported from [blank] Luo. Yesterday, the three ships brought a total of 15,820 bags. ([blank])</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was again misled by rumors, and the buying mood in the market became stronger. Although there was no formal increase in actual sales, the market transaction was surrounded by speculation. Yesterday, not only rice merchants were engaged in absorption, but also outside industries such as finance, yarn and cotton were active in the rice market, especially the cotton yarn groups, who were most greedy. Not only did they absorb spot and futures, but they were also quite greedy for spot rice. Because new transactions of Yinghua Sika have been rare recently, those who hold inventory are hoarding and not selling, and the market chips are suddenly depleted. Therefore, the whole-day Yinghua Sika only closed 500 to 600 tons, while the spot was absorbed by large outside households, and the transaction reached 14,000 to 5,000 bags. The market price saw an increase in the early market, followed by a progressive increase. By the evening closing, it rose by one yuan to [blank] one and a half yuan. No. 1 Saigon Yinghua Sika spot opened at 90 yuan in the afternoon, and the price has been shouted up to 91 yuan, but it is still lacking a complete exit. No. 2 spot is 86 yuan and 3 jiao, December is 84 yuan to 84 yuan and 4 and a half jiao, Xiao Jiao is 80 yuan and 3 jiao to 82 yuan and 8 jiao. At such a rice price, I don't know what will happen, and it is no longer affordable for the average citizen. Many have changed from three meals a day to two meals, and for those who live from hand to mouth, with slightly more family members, it is impossible to get even a porridge and a meal, resulting in beggars on the road and starvation everywhere, and theft cases occur from time to time, all of which are the result of oppression and exploitation by speculators and powerful people. As the saying goes, "If you want to eat sheep brains, you are not afraid of sheep's life," manipulating the people's food supply and placing conscience outside their bellies. Although the facts are so, those who have the duty of guarding and governing cannot shirk their responsibility.</p>
<p>Slightly more new japonica tip and tea seeds arrived, totaling more than 1,000 shi. The local stores were also quite deserted in the sales market, so the selling price also increased by half a yuan. The opening price of new japonica special original package was 94 yuan and a half, the market was 92 yuan and a half, 92 yuan, the hopper saw 88 yuan, 86 yuan, tea [blank] the hopper saw 81 yuan and a half, 81 yuan, Du Jianzhong was 76 yuan and a half, Yang Jianzhong was 71 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice also went smoothly, and there were large households absorbing it, so the price also increased by one yuan [blank]. Kai Yili Bai Yuan was 86 yuan, 84 yuan, Hong Kong Bai Yuan was 78 yuan, 75 yuan and a half.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Orders</h3>
<p>Flour is scheduled from the current period. According to the investigation, since the No. 2 Flour Mill raised its price, it will not be changed for the time being. However, the supply of each factory is decreasing day by day, and the current flour is gradually becoming scarce. For example, the old car brand and Fuxin brand have long been unable to buy goods. Therefore, customers are paying attention to foreign flour. The goods that have been ordered before and have not arrived are being pre-sold in the market. Yesterday, 4,500 white bags of flower and bird and clock tower brands were absorbed by this street and customer hoarding, and the price rose from 18 yuan, 5 jiao and 6 jiao to 18 yuan and 8 jiao. The old car stack has only a few transactions. It is said that the resold Tianzhu brand factory flour is sold at a price of 19 yuan and 6 jiao, and 200 bags have been received from this street.</p>
<p>The wheat market is tight. According to the investigation, the amount of Changxi Du wheat transported by car has increased slightly compared to before, but it must be specified and sent directly to the Japanese factory for unpacking. As for the [blank] factory, it is still difficult to receive goods and it is unwilling to release prices to collect them. It is said that foreign wheat orders are still being negotiated, but due to the lack of ship positions, they cannot arrive on time. Therefore, both buyers and sellers are still hesitating. The factory is also unwilling to publicly order a large amount of foreign wheat.</p>
<h3>Oilseed and Oil, Market Manipulation, No Opportunity</h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market, due to the lack of new stimulus, manipulators had no opportunity. The market was calm, and the market price was slightly different. Tongshi opened 40 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, the price was 72 yuan and 5 jiao, 30 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, 74 yuan and 5 jiao, 200 dan of Dayouyu factory soybean oil, 80 yuan, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, 75 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, 103 yuan and 5 jiao. 800 barrels were ordered for delivery in December, and the price was from 104 yuan to 5 jiao, and the closing price was 103 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. The trend is slightly smaller, which is also possible.</p>
<p>On the 28th, there were 425 bags of soybeans, and on the 29th, there were another 125 bags of soybeans, 23,200 pieces of soybean cakes, 1,140 bags of sesame seeds, and 200 cans of sesame oil, all of which were transported to Hong Kong. On the 28th, 310 bags of soybeans were imported from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Securities: London Foreign Debt Soars, All Debts Rise by One or Two Pounds, Domestic Debt Falls, Buyers Still Not Weak</h3>
<p>In the off-market securities market yesterday, rumors of Nanjing suddenly became popular, and people's hearts became tired. Many floats came out, but short sellers hedged and buyers were still not weak. The opening price was still firm, but the selling was strong and slowly declined. After struggling several times, it was suppressed to 64 yuan and temporarily became crowded. It may be reduced again. The transaction was flat yesterday morning. Type C initially rushed out of 64 yuan, and then declined because Sheng Chang Hengfu Lianyi sold a lot. Lianhe Hongda Jiufeng Dade and others bought in, but failed to raise it. The afternoon closing was slightly reduced by one or two jiao. In the afternoon, although Dade Jiufeng still bought in, Yitai Dingkang also absorbed it, and Shuntai Shunchang also hedged, but Xinfu came out, and Yuxing also had spot goods flowing out. The market felt unsustainable and continued to decline. As a result, all of them fell by two and a half to five jiao, except for Type A, which only fell by five points. The total number of transactions was about 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, the transaction was Huashang Electric</p>
<p>300 shares, the price was 7 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<p>In the public industry stock market, the trend was quiet in the morning. In the afternoon, guided by rubber stocks, the market suddenly turned firm. [blank] The Taiwanese Chinese stock rose directly from the low price of 41 yuan and 75 jiao to 44 yuan at the close. Most of the remaining rubber stocks also had the same proportional progress.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Suddenly Tightens</h3>

<h3>Evening Profit Buying, Gold Market Sharp Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market, the cooked red off-market, suddenly tended to rise sharply from the flat and tired. The 5,700 yuan mark had returned several times, and finally it was close to the 5,800 yuan mark. All parties were very determined. It was rumored that Japan had asked China for peace, but it was not allowed. There was a rumor that they would recognize a certain party. Speculators were actually creating a multi-profit atmosphere, and the foreign exchange rate was tight, which led to a buying trend. Since the morning opening was still flat, still 5,705 yuan, the gold shop Qianzhuang sold out, and it was suppressed to 5,690 yuan. The silver shop bill merchants absorbed it, and the price fluctuated around 5,700 yuan. It once rose sharply at noon, but it was flat soon. In the afternoon, news of profit buying came, although a certain gold shop sold it, the securities bank silver shop bill merchants repeatedly sold in, and the foreign exchange rate was tight, and the rising momentum intensified, rising to a high price of 5,793 yuan. Finally it was 5,790 yuan, a rise of 85 yuan. The total transaction volume for the day was more than 5,000 taels. The swap buyer posted 45 yuan to the seller, with few transactions. The cash was sold by dozens of small Qianzhuangs, and the price was 5 yuan lower than the term transaction. The ornaments and other items were all flat.</p>
<h3>Cooked Red Jumped 85 Yuan</h3>
<p>Initially, it seemed quite deserted, with few transactions and flat prices. According to the 20 taels of the gold shop, it was 5,705 yuan, as the morning opening price. Soon, the Qiandui industry sold 30 taels to the silver shop, and suppressed it to within 5,700 yuan, at 5,690 yuan. Later, the silver shop gang slightly increased the purchase, and the decline stopped and rebounded, but the rise and fall were limited. The silver shop entered the gold shop with 20 taels, 5,708 yuan, and the Qiandui industry sold another 20 taels to the silver shop, which was as low as 5,695 yuan. Afterwards, due to the shift from loose and flat to soft in foreign exchange, retail investors all thought about buying, and the silver shop gang continued to dredge, and Yuhao sold 30 taels to the silver shop for 5,720 yuan. Under the pressure of sales from the Qiandui industry at noon, it still fell by 10, and the gold shop entered 10 taels for 5,712 yuan. The opening in the afternoon had become firm. The Qiandui industry entered the securities bank with 20 taels for 5,740 yuan. After a while, the silver shop sold 30 taels to the securities bank for 5,722 yuan. Unexpectedly, near the evening, the market suddenly turned, and some parties had acknowledged it, and people were shocked. The exchange market was getting tighter and tighter, so the gold price rose. The securities bank silver shop bought a lot, and the highest was the securities bank entering the gold shop with 20 taels for 5,793 yuan. The buying and selling was extremely prosperous for a while. The evening closing, the silver shop sold 30 taels to the Qiandui industry for 5,790 yuan, which was 85 yuan higher than the previous day. The daily fluctuation was a total of 103 yuan. The selling price of the cash store was more than 10 yuan higher than the cooked red, and the closing was 10 yuan. The current standard gold was 560 yuan lower than the listed gold.

<h3>Gold Jewelry Unchanged Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Foreign Currencies Also Rose Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, the cooked red market price rose sharply, the British and American gold pounds also rose by 2 yuan each, the British gold ticket suddenly became dull again, and the market price stood flat. The US gold ticket stood out at the 17 yuan mark, because there was a new message about the "Central Bank" in the market, which caused the black market foreign exchange to rise again, and the US gold ticket rose to 17 yuan, 1 jiao and 8 points, a sharp rise of 4 jiao compared to the previous day. Hong Kong ticket trend was firm, the evening market was 4 yuan and 3 points. Canadian tickets and Philippine tickets were also firm.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton, Cotton Yarn Hesitating, 200 Yuan Mark Entering and Exiting</h3>
<p>The yarn market has entered a revolving state again, but the inferior form is relatively quiet, because the rumors of the previous day are not credible, so it is difficult for general shorts to see small, but old bulls have not shaken, so it once broke into the 1,200 yuan mark, and once came back to pull short, and the market rebound and rise, but the current spot sales are still weak, and the power of doing more has not been fully developed. Judging from the current situation, it will not tend to fall. Yesterday, there were 1,660 pieces of cotton yarn, today there were 510 pieces transported to Hong Kong, and another 40 pieces transported to Xiao Luzon, and 10 pieces transported to Siam.</p>
<p>Shuangma opened stably in the morning, and the first round price was 1,211 yuan, which was not much different from the previous day's price. As soon as this round opened, short sellers were extremely active, and the selling was dense for a time, falling directly to within 1,200 yuan, and the lowest price was 1,198 yuan. Later, I heard that the foreign exchange was calm, and the price had fallen, so the selling was unwilling to add more, and instead saw a replenishment. So the chips turned tight, and the tailwind suddenly appeared, and it rose out of the pass again, rising to 1,210 yuan. Later, there were those who took profits and sold out, and at the same time, actual sales were weak, and the decline was seen again, but the bulls did not give up, and the closing price was 1,214 yuan. According to the half-day [blank] transaction statistics of 6,310 bales, the price of 20 Shuangma yarns rose by 1 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed on the left,</p>
<h3>Cotton Merchants Watch</h3>
<p>Spot cotton transactions are even more sluggish, and the market is weak, and factory forces are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. As for the merchants, in view of the above situation, the way out is not good, and their actions are not as prosperous as in the past, but the general psychology is still optimistic.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, in the early morning, first because the telegram from Liverpool reported a rise, and then because of the weakness of the Wall Street stock market, and the closing price as a result of some southern set buying, was 34 pounds lower than the previous day, and India rose by more than 1 rupee along with the forecast.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton transactions have been quite quiet recently, and the purchase from all parties is very weak, especially from the factory. The industry is also temporarily holding a wait-and-see attitude, but it is generally expected that the cotton market will turn around in mid-F month.</p>
<h3>Reduced Prices for Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth Still Draw Buyers</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday, with price fluctuations of only a few cents. Sales continued steadily, and there were rumors that the factory unified tax would be temporarily suspended from increasing, which greatly boosted confidence. Jobbers and customers bought when prices were low, and sellers held firm on prices. Small amounts of coarse and fine cloth sold at street markets fell by five cents to one and a half cents per piece, but rebounded in the afternoon, ending flat. Dyed cloth was flat in the morning but rose by two and a half cents per piece in the afternoon. Transactions on this street totaled nearly a thousand pieces, including over a hundred pieces of coarse cloth from the Yantai merchants, over three hundred pieces of twill, colored cloth, bleached cloth, and poplin from the Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants, and two hundred and several dozen pieces of colored cloth and colored twill from the Zhejiang and Fujian merchants.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Prices fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, and the market strengthened. White cloth, particularly the best fine cloth, once dropped to 34.80 yuan in the morning. However, the market improved due to rising bid prices, and merchants here were optimistic, continuing to buy. Prices rose accordingly, and the best fine cloth sold at 35.30 yuan at closing, up one and a half cents per piece. Serge sold for 1.08 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: On the 28th, 2,680 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong, and on the 29th, 13 pieces were shipped to Luzon, 42 pieces to Siam, and 1,695 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Mohair Gains Popularity</h3>
<p>Mohair has been selling well recently because its pile is neat and even, its luster is bright, and it comes in many colors. Most of the local ladies are flocking to it, and "sea white dragon" wool is now considered outdated. Therefore, most new women's overcoats are made of mohair. They are also buying matching handbags, which cost at least 25 or 26 yuan in legal tender per bag. Thus, a mohair overcoat costs at least 150 or 160 yuan in legal tender. The most popular colors are very light sky blue and navy blue. Wholesale prices are 87 or 88 yuan per yard, while "Three Camel" brand "sea white dragon" wool sells for 64 or 65 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Red and White Sugar Rise in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was initially weak but then tightened, with only slight fluctuations. The guild's opening price in the morning for spot goods was 72.20 yuan for No. 24 coarse white sugar at local warehouses (slightly higher) and 71.70 yuan (slightly lower) for sugar from outside warehouses. Spot Dutch red sugar was 55.50 to 55.30 yuan (slightly lower to slightly higher), Taikoo granulated white sugar B mark from Western warehouses was 75 yuan, HX mark was 68 yuan, with little fluctuation. In the afternoon, prices for both red and white sugar were raised by one yuan, but there were no transactions. This store's No. 1 rock sugar was 92 yuan, and Jingming rock sugar was 93.50 yuan (slightly more).</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Shortage of Orchid Bamboo Branches</h3>
<p>Recently, Jinshan orchid bamboo branches have been sluggish due to price cuts. However, production costs have not decreased and there have been unexpected expenses such as special fees, which have increased costs and created a difficult situation. Consequently, the supply is extremely scarce, and it is said that the brokers are collectively holding onto unsold goods. If sales can improve, there is hope for a recovery.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Ginseng, Deer Velvet, and White Fungus Exceedingly Expensive</h3>
<p>With the arrival of winter, it is the season for tonics, and the market for ginseng, deer velvet, and white fungus is active. Sichuan white fungus is in extremely short supply, and prices have been rising again this week, with top-grade selling for over 260 yuan per catty, mid-grade for over 160 yuan per catty, and even F-grade requiring about 100 yuan per catty. Jilin Changbai Mountain ginseng is not available this year due to government control, and the ginseng being sold is old stock from previous years. Prices are extraordinarily high, with ginseng weighing one tael selling for 1,500 yuan per tael and ginseng weighing over one qian selling for 400 yuan per tael. Deer velvet is heavily taxed, with strong antlers costing 3,000 yuan per pair and ordinary ones costing around 2,000 yuan. Cut velvet sells for 90 or 80 yuan per tael. Other direct ginseng, with 30 pieces per catty, is scarce, and sales are strong. The listed price is 290 yuan per catty, but it is difficult to obtain, and a premium of 10 yuan must be added to buy one or two pieces at 300 yuan per catty, as merchants are very optimistic and expect prices to rise to 320 yuan. Fortunately, these are luxury items, and although expensive, they do not affect people's livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Cement and Steel Bars Return to Normal</h3>
<p>The previously declining market for cement and steel bars saw improvement yesterday. Because construction companies and Tianjin merchants were purchasing, merchants regained confidence, and the market began to turn around. Sales yesterday totaled 40 to 50 tons, and prices increased due to demand, with three- to four-point sizes at 1,150 yuan and five-point to one-inch sizes at 1,890 yuan, all up 30 to 40 yuan from before.</p>
<h3>New Dollar Exceeds the 60 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Although trading in new dollars was not very lively yesterday, merchants were unusually optimistic. Although goods are still being shipped from overseas, costs are very high, and freight rates have doubled, so market prices have been rising daily. Sales yesterday totaled 30 to 40 tons, and asking prices exceeded the 60 yuan mark.</p>
<h3>Coal: Indian Coal Slightly Higher in Unofficial Trading</h3>
<p>Although the city has ample reserves of Indian bituminous coal, imports have been scarce in recent months due to high freight rates and soaring costs. Yesterday, stockyard prices rose slightly, with Indian bituminous coal warehouse receipts trading at 208 yuan unofficially, up 5 or 6 yuan from the beginning of the month, though the listed price remained at 210 yuan.</p>

<h3>Improved Treatment Soon to Be Realized, Chinese Constables Faithfully Serve, Report to Duty as Usual, No Strike Occurrences, Bureau Long Considered Difficult Living Conditions</h3>
<p>Major Bowen of the Public Works Department Police Division denied the rumors circulating yesterday that Chinese constables were threatening to strike over demands for a pay raise. He told reporters that the Chinese constables had all reported to duty and there had been no strike threats. Bowen said that before reporting to duty, the Chinese constables at each police station only expressed their desire to receive increased wages and rice subsidies, and then reported to duty as usual. The Public Works Department had already considered increasing the salaries and rice subsidies of Chinese constables and it may be implemented soon. Bowen denied that there was any organized expression of dissatisfaction in the police division he leads. He said that although the demands for increased salaries and rice subsidies were made simultaneously by Chinese constables at each police station on Wednesday (the 27th), this matter did not have any significant importance. Bowen explained that it was possible that the Chinese constables at each police station had heard that the Chinese constables at the Jing'an Temple police station would make this request, so they also decided to make the request at the same time.</p>
<p>Chinese Constables Demand Improved Treatment</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that Chinese constables at the five police stations in the Public Concession had threatened to strike in order to obtain higher monthly salaries, which could lead to the most serious labor unrest in the city's history. However, according to Bowen, head of the Public Works Department Police Division, Chinese constables' monthly salaries would soon be increased somewhat, and the matter could be resolved without difficulty. The matter began yesterday (the 27th) in the afternoon, when the night shift Chinese constables at four police stations, including 88 at the Jing'an Temple police station, 25 at the Gordon Road police station, and 20 each at the Prude Road and New Zhabei police stations, refused to report to duty.</p>
<p>Police Officers Guarantee Consideration</p>
<p>Just after noon today (the 28th), 50 Chinese constables at the Chengdu Road police station also refused to report to duty after signing in. Their representatives then held secret talks with the Western police officers in charge, and some of the Chinese constables had already returned to work as usual. The striking Chinese constables said that their current monthly salaries were insufficient to live on, so they demanded an immediate increase in basic monthly salaries and rice subsidies. After the Western police officers guaranteed that those in charge would consider the matter carefully, they returned to duty together. As of today, they are still working as usual, and a response is being awaited from the Police Division.</p>
<p>How to Increase Is Being Studied</p>
<p>Bowen told reporters that he had been discussing the matter with the leaders of the Chinese constables for the past two or three weeks and had already prepared to increase the monthly salaries of the Chinese constables, but the details of how to increase the salaries had not yet been determined. It was unlikely that the increase would be in the form of increased rice subsidies. As the matter has not been completely resolved, a decision has not yet been made to notify the Chinese constables, but once the Chinese constables learn of the decision, the matter should be resolved.</p>
<p>Amount of Rice Subsidy Based on Market Price</p>
<p>The current minimum monthly salary for Chinese constables in the Public Concession is 18 yuan, plus a cost-of-living allowance of 85%, a rice subsidy of 9 yuan, and a clothing allowance of some amount. The Chinese constables said that although rice prices reached an unprecedented high yesterday, their rice subsidy had recently been reduced by 1.5 yuan. Public Works Department officials said that the subsidy is determined by market prices and is subject to change.</p>
<p>Authorities Appreciate Difficult Living Conditions</p>
<p>Nash, Assistant Director of the Public Works Department, said that the authorities are considering the difficulties faced by the Chinese constables. Now that everything seems to be calm and the Chinese constables have reported back to duty, it seems likely that an agreement can be reached. As for whether the dispute can be resolved within the next two days, it is still impossible to say, because the solution must be approved by the various committees of the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Japanese Third Fleet Concentrated in Zhoushan</h3>
<p>Including Two Aircraft Carriers According to Reliable Information from the Shipping Industry The Ships of the Japanese Third Fleet Stationed in China are Now Massing in the Waters of the Zhoushan Islands. At Daishan Dongshajiao, Shenjiadou, Maqimen, and Dinghai Toutougang, from Donggangpu in the east to Zhushanmen in the west, a total of fifteen or sixteen Japanese warships of various sizes have gathered. The seized foreign ships Moufu, Feikang, and Dasheng are also being monitored. Among them are two aircraft carriers, anchored nearby, and there is frequent movement back and forth, suggesting possible intentions. The Chinese military along the coast has been placed on high alert.</p>
<h3>Joint Consultation by Authorities of the Two Concessions: Abolishing Malpractices of "Small Rents"</h3>
<p>Both Parties Engaging in Parallel Research, Several Joint Meetings Held</p>
<p>Information received yesterday indicates that the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession have held several joint meetings to discuss abolishing the malpractice of "small rents" within the two concessions. According to a spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), the French Concession's special committee recently submitted a report suggesting steps to abolish "small rents" within the concession. The SMC has since held several talks with the French authorities and will likely continue these discussions. Both concessions are currently engaged in parallel research on the issue of abolishing "small rents." However, the SMC is currently only conducting research and has not made any decisions. Meanwhile, residents of the French Concession are continuing to urge French Consul-General M. Mazerat to accept the committee's recommendation to eliminate malpractices such as "small rents," but there is no indication of when M. Mazerat will make a decision.</p>
<p>No Forced Eviction for Timely Rent Payment</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, French Consul-General in Shanghai, M. Mazerat, recently received the draft of the consular order (i.e., housing regulations) prepared by the French Concession Housing Management Committee and has listened to reports and criticisms from various parties to address any shortcomings in the consular order. A well-known French lawyer in the city, who has written commentaries on housing issues, visited M. Mazerat yesterday (the 27th) afternoon and suggested including a clause in the consular order stipulating that landlords cannot force tenants to move out if they pay their rent on time, and if they agree to a reasonable rent increase, regardless of whether the lease has expired. Implementing this clause would prevent landlords from forcing tenants whose leases have expired to move out in order to lease the premises to tenants who can pay higher rents and "small rents." If this clause is not implemented, the entire consular order will be ineffective, as landlords seeking profit will exploit this loophole. It is generally believed that the French Consul-General will discuss in detail the draft consular order that has been published in various newspapers recently and will soon take full steps to eliminate methods of extortion such as exorbitant rent increases and the collection of "small rents."</p>
<h3>Shanghai "City Police" Arbitrarily Detains Truck, Attempts to Extort Fees, Released After Negotiation</h3>
<p>According to the English-language China Press, a truck belonging to Moutrie &amp; Co. was traveling along the Xijiao (Western District) Lujiatai Road at around 11:00 AM yesterday (the 27th) when a "city policeman" ordered it to stop. When the driver refused, another "city policeman" jumped onto the truck's running board and forced the driver to stop. The truck was then detained. At noon, Moutrie &amp; Co. received a phone call from the "City Police Bureau," stating that the truck did not have a "city permit" and required a payment of 120 yuan, or the truck would not be released. The management of Moutrie &amp; Co. replied that they would not pay the fee until a reason was given. In the afternoon, a worker from the truck brought back a letter from the "Public Security Bureau, Xujiahui Branch," stating that a payment of 41 yuan and 93 cents was required to obtain a permit. After receiving the letter, Moutrie &amp; Co. reported the matter to the Jing'an Temple Police Station for negotiation. The truck was finally released at around 4:30 PM without any payment.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Going to Hong Kong Remain Unchanged, No Immediate Plans to Establish Immigration Bureau Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Hong Kong government promulgated new immigration control regulations, scheduled to take effect on the 18th of next month, major shipping companies in Shanghai, such as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, the Java-China-Japan Lijn, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., and Butterfield &amp; Swire, have successively telegraphed their Hong Kong offices to inquire about what additional procedures Shanghai passengers going to Hong Kong would need to complete. However, as of yesterday, no replies had been received from Hong Kong. It is reported that the British Consulate in Shanghai has also not received any telegrams from Hong Kong, so they are unable to answer inquiries from passengers. Whether travel procedures will change will be determined after a reply arrives in Shanghai. According to the shipping industry, the procedures for Shanghai passengers going to Hong Kong will be determined after the establishment of an immigration bureau office in Shanghai, based on the new immigration regulations.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Criticize Telephone Price Increase After Public Announcement, Contradiction Between Adding New Lines and Reducing Usage, Citizens Eagerly Awaiting Chinese Directors to Argue on Sound Grounds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company, citing increased demand and inability to cope, proposed a request to increase surcharges. After being approved by the authorities of the two concessions and announced to take effect on the 7th of next month, various circles in Shanghai were in uproar upon hearing the news, expressing dissatisfaction. According to general opinions from the Chinese side, the company's main reason for the increase is the need to add new lines and expand equipment. Under the current situation of increased demand, this move by the company is certainly justifiable.</p>
<p>New Line Costs Should Be Amortized</p>
<p>However, although the cost of adding new lines is high, the period of use is also very long. If the price of new lines is calculated based on the years of use, the average annual cost is very small. Now the company is increasing prices by more than double. Not to mention that it has completely lost the meaning of a public utility, it is also difficult to reconcile with the company's stated reason for the increase. After the company increases prices, revenue will increase by 70%, but the average annual cost of purchasing new lines during their period of use is actually far lower than this figure.</p>
<p>Reduction of Calls Lacks Justification</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reason for reducing the number of basic calls and increasing the price of exceeding the number of calls is to reduce the number of calls and increase the rate. However, as long as this abnormal prosperity exists, it will be difficult to reduce the number of calls. Moreover, since the company wants to add new lines to meet customer needs, it seems contradictory to restrict customer usage. Currently, the general residents of Shanghai are eagerly awaiting the Chinese directors to argue on sound grounds and try to reverse the situation to reduce the increase, otherwise Shanghai's commerce will suffer an adverse impact, and residents' lives will become more painful.</p>
<p>Special Telephones Will Also Increase in Price</p>
<p>Special telephones of the Shanghai Telephone Company, such as "short-distance calls" connecting to the Nanshi (Chinese City) and Zhabei (Chapei) city centers, previously cost 10 cents in legal tender each time. It is now reported that due to the company's price increase, the Japanese "Central China Electric Communication Company" has dispatched representatives to negotiate with the Shanghai Telephone Company to increase the price of short-distance calls. The percentage of the increase is still under negotiation. In addition, the company originally charged a handling fee of 10 cents for transferring long-distance calls to other cities, but whether this will also increase in price is reportedly under consideration.</p>
<h3>US Warships Return to Shanghai, Japanese "Izumo" Sails to Nanjing</h3>
<p>The U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, the Shanghai-based river gunboats USS Luzon and USS Guam, left port together early Tuesday morning (the 26th) to patrol the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, still berthed at the British and French naval pontoons off Yangjingbang. The flagship of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, the "Izumo," also left Shanghai at 1:50 PM on Tuesday and is reportedly heading to Nanjing, expected to stay in Nanjing for about a week before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Orders Sold at 10% Discount, Shanghai Municipal Council Hopes for Same Treatment for Stockpiled Rice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), after consultation with the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills, has been supplying subsidized flour daily since October 11, at 8,065 bags per day. The original price per bag from the factory was 17 yuan, but due to the increased cost of imported wheat, it was changed to 18 yuan per bag on the 25th of this month, plus a handling fee of 3 jiao for retail flour shops. It is now learned that the SMC, for further</p>
<p>Coordination Purposes</p>
<p>Specially sent letters yesterday through Mr. Marshall, Chairman of the Food Committee of the Bureau, to major foreign flour import firms in the city, requesting them to negotiate with their respective regular customers to offer one-tenth of their orders to major flour shops for subsidized sale at a price of 18 yuan per bag (the same as the price of flour factories in this street), plus a handling fee of 3 jiao. For the foreign flour that arrives, the major flour shops will be responsible for paying the price of 18 yuan per bag in advance. The foreign firms have agreed to the Bureau's proposal, and</p>
<p>Regular Customers of Foreign Flour</p>
<p>Have also generously cooperated. Retail flour is priced at 18 yuan and 3 jiao per bag, which is indeed high, but in order to prevent further price increases, offering a percentage of the orders for subsidized sale is quite proper. Now that rice prices are gradually rising, and people are struggling to make ends meet, various circles have heard the news and hope that the SMC will take similar measures for stockpiled rice.</p>
<h3>New French Consul General Inspects Police Station</h3>
<p>At 9:50 AM yesterday, the new French Consul General in Shanghai, M. Mazerat, accompanied by French Police Commissioner Lieutenant Colonel Fabreton, inspected the Lokawei Central Police Station and the General Administration, Political Department, Detective Department, and Vehicle Affairs Department. When Consul General Mazerat arrived at the entrance of the Central Police Station, the Russian Police Team, Vietnamese Police Team, and Reserve Team under the Police Department were all lined up to play music in welcome.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents of Wuchang Road Plot Self-Defense</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Japanese-language "Continental Daily News" reported yesterday (the 27th) that the Shanghai Japanese Road Associations had recently organized self-defense groups. Only the Japanese residents of Wuchang Road, because they had not organized a road association, could not participate in the self-defense groups. However, the alleys and lanes around Wuchang Road are complex and crisscrossed, often used by terrorists and thieves to escape. Therefore, the Japanese residents of Wuchang Road will establish the Wuchang Road Japanese Association tonight (the 28th) and organize a self-defense committee, planning to send ten members every night to strictly guard and patrol the road.</p>
<h3>Conditions in Shaoxing After the Robbery</h3>
<p>Residents of Shaoxing and Ningbo who detoured through Shipu to reach Shanghai reported that the Japanese army occupied Shaoxing this time, occupying the Yide pawnshop on Putijie (Bodhi Street) as its headquarters. The Japanese army entered the city on the 25th and was surrounded on the 28th, broke through the siege and fled to Keqiao. The Chinese army pursued and recovered Keqiao on the 29th. The Japanese retreated to Xiaoshan. The stores set on fire in the city were all in the busy areas of the main street, from Taoyuanchang west of the county bridge to Shuicheng Bridge, with more than 600 stores burned down, resulting in huge losses. Currently, in Shaoxing after the robbery, rice prices have soared, selling for 103 yuan per picul, and Erliu flour sells for 6 jiao and 8 fen per jin. Residents are eating Erliu flour to fill their stomachs, and rice is rarely seen. Only wealthy families can afford to taste it. The situation is too miserable to describe. It is hoped that Zhejiang organizations in Shanghai will raise funds to provide relief and assist the government in handling winter relief.</p>
<p>Ningbo Plague Eradicated</p>
<p>The Ningbo city area has discovered plague. Since the efforts of various epidemic prevention personnel, the epidemic has been eradicated. The relocation of various items in the area has now begun. It is learned that after registration by the registration section, many items have been relocated. The relocation sites are divided into three areas: (1) Kaiming Street, (2) Zhongshan East Road, (3) Donghou Street. In addition, the disinfection office organized by the epidemic prevention department is working day and night, which is quite intense.</p>
<h3>Civet Cats on the Road, Police Allowed to Shoot, For Fear of Spreading Rabies</h3>
<p>At a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Health Committee on the 20th of this month, the problem of rabies in the city was discussed. It was unanimously resolved to advise dog owners to voluntarily vaccinate their dogs against rabies to prevent transmission. However, the Bureau does not forcibly implement this measure. On the one hand, the Police Department is requested to step up the capture of stray dogs. In addition, civet cats often transmit rabies to dogs. In the future, civet cats will be allowed to be shot by police on the road to prevent this. Those who value hygiene and raise cats must pay attention to this. The case was approved by the SMC Board of Directors at its regular meeting on the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3>Fake "Citizen Certificates" Discovered, Public Suffers Greatly</h3>
<p>In recent days, many forged "Citizen Certificates" have been discovered entering and leaving Nanshi (Chinese City), causing the public to suffer greatly.</p>

<h3>US Relief Supplies to China Shipped Monthly by Special Vessels, Donated Winter Clothing in Shanghai Not Accepted by Pawnshops</h3>
<p>The American Red Cross officially announced on the 5th of this month that its Washington headquarters has decided to allocate several million US dollars to relieve refugees in the Chinese war zone. Relief supplies to Shanghai will be shipped monthly by a vessel, carrying various relief items, including 6,000 boxes of toys, which are expected to be shipped to Shanghai before this year's Christmas to be distributed to children. Medical supplies for free China, worth approximately 350,000 US dollars, were shipped from New York to Rangoon on the 6th of this month, expected to arrive in Rangoon in early December, and then transported to China via the Burma Road, to be distributed by Dr. Baker. As for the relief efforts in Shanghai, regarding the distribution of clothing,</p>
<p>Buddhist Association Presents to</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council states, "Now that various philanthropists have entrusted us to make a large number of cotton clothes to distribute to the poor to help them get through the cold winter, most of the poor are unscrupulous, and after receiving the winter clothes, they either pawn or sell them to get money to use drugs, so they still feel cold, which is quite a letdown to the hard work of the donors. We will make the clothes in two colors (the body of the cotton-padded jacket and the sleeves will be gray and black, and the legs and crotch of the cotton-padded pants will be gray and black) to distinguish them, and we will add a stamp on the clothes to prohibit pawning or selling, so that the poor can truly benefit. Therefore, we prepare this document and respectfully ask you to examine it and order the Pawnbrokers Association to notify all pawnshops that the above-mentioned donated clothes shall not be accepted for pawning, and we also ask you to notify your affiliated police stations to pass the word to the police to check and prohibit pawning at any time to benefit the poor. This is truly a public convenience." Here is a transcript of the reply from Mr. Nash of the SMC Secretariat: "To the Shanghai Buddhist Association, greetings. We have received your letter of November 13 regarding the winter relief and the distribution of cotton clothes. Your work in relieving the poor is commendable. We have now notified the Police Department to pay special attention." The YMCA is also raising donations for winter clothes and has purchased cloth and cotton raw materials to start sewing. However, because labor costs are high this year, it is greatly affected. The Association is now soliciting charitable women from all walks of life to sew on a voluntary basis, and has established three methods: (1) sewing at the Association; (2) taking it home to sew; (3) donating wages of 5 jiao per set. The Association has detailed methods available for reference. Also, the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association</p>
<p>Sells White Rice at a Reduced Price</p>
<p>It has now selected the Qianye Guild Hall on Wenjian Shi Road as the first subsidized sales point, and Mr. Gu Yuanchang has been publicly elected as the director. The Second Subsidized Sales point will be at the Zhiyuan Dharma Assembly on Father Du Road, and Mr. Jin Baokun has been publicly elected as the director. Subsidized sales will begin on the 1st of next month, with a price of 1 jiao per market jin. Each person is limited to purchasing 3 market jin. This is truly good news for the poor in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Currency Exchange Industry Reserve Bank Signed a Contract, Total Capital of 250,000 National Currency Fully Subscribed, Opening Soon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Currency Exchange Industry Association, in order to seek the development of the currency exchange business and improve the happiness and convenience of the industry, has decided to establish a joint reserve bank with a total capital of 250,000 national currency. The member money shops have fully subscribed to the capital and signed the reserve bank contract. The contract has eight conditions that must be strictly adhered to. The contract does not allow the stock to be mortgaged for loans and stipulates the distribution method of shareholder dividends. The bank is being prepared by Manager Liu Xichen and will open as soon as the new building is completed.</p>
<h3>Silver Car Not Sold, Yunfei Company Denies Purchase</h3>
<p>Mr. Boroght, manager of the American Yunfei Motor Company in this port, yesterday denied rumors that his company will buy the Silver Car Company. He said that the two companies are completely independent of each other. The Silver cars seen in Yunfei's garage are there for repair, as Yunfei has a repair contract with Silver Car.</p>
<h3>Spitting Prohibited in the Bazi Bridge Market</h3>
<p>The authorities of the Bazi Bridge Vegetable Market and the Health Department previously launched a week-long campaign to prohibit spitting, in the hope that those who come to the market will not spit everywhere. For this reason, 10,000 Chinese leaflets were distributed the previous week, explaining the dangers of not complying with the regulations and asking those who understand the cooperative benefits of this campaign to advise their relatives and friends to run the case. After this move, there has been some improvement, but further perfection is still needed. Therefore, the market authorities have decided to implement the final measure, that is, to strictly enforce the French concession's orders on this matter and impose a fine of 2 jiao on the spot for each instance of spitting.</p>
<h3>French Concession Tramway Machine Office Workers Provide Normal Service</h3>
<p>According to the English-language China Press, the French Concession Tramway Company continued to work today (the 28th), and everything was as usual. The workers in the machine office recently raised 17 demands due to dissatisfaction with their allowances, and their representatives are prepared to meet with the company again to discuss the various demands. According to Mr. Flay, the manager of the tramway company, the situation today is quite calm, and there is no danger of another work slowdown. Labor and management representatives will discuss the entire relationship between the two sides. It is learned that the demands put forward by the workers include reducing working hours, providing allowances, and free schooling for workers' children. It is reported that none of these demands have been agreed upon, but the workers' demands have not specified a deadline for a response, so the company feels that a compromise can be negotiated and reached in the short term, and there will be no further disturbances.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Another US Loan to Aid China Highly Valued by US Citizens in Shanghai, Telephoned US State Department Yesterday to Inquire About Truth, Shanghai Financial Circles Quietly Awaiting Definite News</h3>
<p>Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Hu Shih and financial and economic expert Song Ziwen jointly visited US Secretary of State Hull on the 26th to discuss the general situation in the Far East for 30 minutes. After this news reached Shanghai, Chinese and foreign people paid close attention. The nature of the progress of the issues discussed by Song Ziwen and Ambassador Hu in their meeting with Hull has not been revealed, but general observers believe that a large amount of assistance in</p>
<p>Aiding China</p>
<p>Must be one of the hearts of the discussion. Although the two Chinese officials did not express an opinion on the matter of another loan to China, another rumor said that China is expected to borrow at least $50 million in US loans. The financial community is paying close attention because some people believe that since the United States strengthened its policy toward the Far East, there is no problem in actively aiding China. The State Department's active withdrawal of expatriates in the Far East can prove this point. Yesterday, the commercial and financial circles in Shanghai aroused</p>
<p>Intense Excitement</p>
<p>Among them, they have been quietly awaiting news from the State Department in Washington regarding this aid-to-China message since yesterday. Some US expat New Voice News reporters have already telegraphed the State Department yesterday to inquire whether the United States has agreed to continue lending 20 million US dollars to the Chongqing Chinese government. Other US expat public organizations have also successively telegraphed the State Department to inquire about official aid-to-China loans. US expatriates in Shanghai are waiting quietly for the State Department's reply.</p>

<h3>The Fifth Lecture of the Rongwu Society: Elucidating the True Meaning of Meditation. Pastor Anderson Explains the Merits of Christianity. Buddhist Meditation (Dhyana) is Divided into Four Points.</h3>
<p>In the fifth lecture of the Rongwu Lecture Society, Mr. Shen Daling first introduced American Pastor Anderson, who spoke about the similarities between Christianity and Confucianism. Mr. Lu Zhuoqiao then elaborated on Pastor Anderson's 26 years in China and his enthusiasm. Pastor Anderson then took the stage and delivered his speech in fluent Chinese, first humbly stating that he had little knowledge of Confucianism. He then spoke about his experiences with Christianity, highlighting three advantages. The first point is having a central belief, without disappointment even amidst various difficulties and hardships, allowing one to maintain their principles. The second point is having a definite direction, with an implicit guide leading to the goal. The third point is that regardless of the size of the position or the amount of salary, one must do their best. The audience applauded. In fact, the first point is Confucius's "not being perplexed and knowing destiny," the second point is Confucius's "stopping at perfect goodness," and the third point is Confucius's "revering affairs and eating afterward, being respectful in service, and being loyal to others." Then, Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke about the fifth similarity between Confucianism and Buddhism, which is the fifth of the Six Paramitas, namely Dhyana Paramita. Dhyana in Chinese means "mindfulness cultivation," newly translated as "quiet contemplation," meaning that the mind is concentrated on one state without distractions. This is what the book Liezi refers to as "using the will without confusion, thereby concentrating on the spirit," which is focused attention. Buddhists call it "Dhyana," and Song Confucians call it "meditation." According to Buddhist scriptures and treatises, it is further divided into four items.</p>
<p>The Principle of Meditation</p>
<p>The Yuanjue Sutra says, "Undoubted pure wisdom is born from meditation." This is the meaning of the Great Learning's teaching that "knowing where to stop leads to stability, which leads to tranquility, which leads to peace, which leads to contemplation, and ultimately to attainment." The Zazen Yiqi (Principles of Zazen) says, "Transcending the ordinary and surpassing the saintly necessarily relies on quiet conditions. Sitting and escaping, standing and dying, must depend on the power of concentration." It also says, "To learn the Prajna Bodhisattva, one should diligently cultivate Samadhi. Samadhi is the stillness of the mind-essence, away from evil and chaos. The Great Learning speaks of cultivating the self by rectifying the mind, and the Doctrine of the Mean speaks of following one's nature by being cautious in solitude. The Analects speaks of the benevolent being tranquil, the Book of Odes speaks of having no impure thoughts, the Yi Jing speaks of 'Gen' (Keeping Still) as stopping the back, and even Meng Shishe's guarding of qi is not as good as Zeng Zi's guarding of simplicity, and Mencius's unmoved mind is different from Gaozi's unmoved mind."</p>
<p>The Method of Meditation</p>
<p>The Zazen Yiqi also says, "Release all connections, rest all affairs, body and mind as one, silence without gap, sit upright with the body straight, tongue touching the upper palate, lips and teeth touching, eyes slightly open. Once the body posture is fixed, the breath is regulated, relax the navel and abdomen, and do not think about anything, good or evil. When a thought arises, immediately be aware of it, and as soon as you are aware of it, it disappears. After a long time of forgetting connections, it naturally becomes one piece, and the four elements are light and comfortable, which is called the Dharma of Anle (peace and joy). At all times, protect the power of concentration as if protecting an infant. When the water of concentration is clear, the pearl of the mind will naturally appear. This fixed mind can produce the Dharma of wisdom." The meditation methods of the Song Confucians: the Cheng-Zhu school said, "Maintain reverence," which originated from the Book of Documents, "Those who are respectful win, those who are lazy lose." The Yi Jing's Qian trigram says, "The superior man is cautiously watchful all day." The Kun trigram says, "Reverence rectifies the inner." The Lu-Wang school said, "Maintain stillness," which originated from the Yi Jing's Gen trigram, "Keeping Still keeps his back," and the commentary says, "Keeping Still means stopping." This is the Chan school's "cutting off all appearances, emptying the mind, and having no good or evil." The Zhou-Shao school said, "Maintain observation," which originated from Laozi's "observing the subtleties," "observing the orifices," and "observing the return," also from the Yi Jing's Guan trigram, "observing life," and the Gan trigram, "observing sensation," which is the Tiantai school's "one mind, three observations – emptiness, falsehood, and the middle." Li Yannian would often sit silently, purifying his mind to experience the state before emotions arose, which Zhu Xi called the "secret transmission of the Guishan school."</p>
<p>The Benefits of Meditation</p>
<p>The Yue Deng Sanwei Sutra says, "The Buddha said, if a Bodhisattva abides in secluded sitting, there are ten kinds of benefits," and ultimately "attaining the Four Unimpeded Wisdoms." Also, the Buddha said, "If a Bodhisattva loves solitude, there are ten kinds of benefits," and ultimately "less effort is needed to attain Samadhi." The Doctrine of the Mean says, "The way of utmost sincerity can foreknow; therefore, utmost sincerity is like a god." The Yi Jing's Xici commentary says, "Without thought, without action, still and unmoving, it responds and penetrates all the affairs of the world. Who can participate in this if not one who possesses the utmost sincerity in the world?" The Zhizhe Great Master's "adjusting the body, adjusting the breath, and adjusting the mind" are explained in detail in the "Tiantai Zhi Guan." Its effect of removing obstacles and curing diseases is described in the "Buddhist Patriarchs' Chronicle." As for the Shurangama Sutra's saying "the Dao embryo has been formed" and the Avatamsaka Sutra's saying "the Tathagata appears," then "the work is accomplished and the embryo is formed." The function of meditation is complete.</p>
<p>The Harm of Non-Meditation</p>
<p>The Buddha's Testament Sutra contains the precept against "indulgence in the five desires," and the Yuanjue Sutra contains the warning "where will the deluded body be?" Both speak of the harm of not knowing Dhyana. The Dao cannot be separated from one for even a moment. "What is preserved in man, if day and night it is shackled and lost," then one is tempted by material desires, and "man is transformed into an object," "sinking and drowning the mind." If one does not know to seek release, drifts and forgets to return, then it is like "pulling up seedlings to help them grow, and harming them instead." Therefore, Mencius "seeks to release the lost mind, attains innate knowledge, preserves the night qi, cultivates the vast righteousness, and reaches the unmoved mind."</p>
<h3>Abandoning Wife After Contracting a Terrible Disease, Cohabitating with a Dancer</h3>
<p>Xu Yilei, the owner of the Xie Xing Lumber Company in Ningbo, has a son named Meikun, who is currently 26 years old. In 1934, he married Qian Lianqi (currently 24 years old), a local woman, through a matchmaker. They had a son after marriage, who is now six years old. However, Xu Meikun enjoyed promiscuity and did not engage in proper work. As a result of seeking pleasure, he contracted a terrible disease. Qian also became infected, leading to a deterioration in their marital relationship. Through the mediation of lawyer Wu Linkun, they signed a separation agreement on October 1, 1936, stipulating that the separation period would be one year. Xu Meikun would pay Qian a monthly living allowance of 150 yuan and bear the medical expenses for treating her disease. Cohabitation would only resume if Xu Meikun's disease was completely cured and he had a normal job. However, after the couple separated, Xu Meikun became an unbridled horse. He met a dancer from the Weigong Dance Hall named Li (currently 25 years old), who was from Ningbo. In October 1938, he began cohabitating with her, first building a "golden house" in Taoyuanfang, North Henan Road, and then moving to No. 30, Fulu Lane, No. 814, Haining Road. Xu, having found new love, stopped paying Qian the agreed-upon monthly allowance, leaving her alone in her mother's home at No. 103 Zhangjiazhai, Aiwunyi Road. Recently, Qian discovered Xu's secret and reported it to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Station. Chinese Detective Liang Yuliang requested a search warrant from the Special First Court. On the morning of the 13th, at 5:45 AM, he went and arrested the pair of "wild mandarin ducks." Because they had a fixed residence, they were not detained. In the morning, the Special First Court, based on the police station's request, summoned both parties. Police lawyer Fang Fushu prosecuted them for adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law, stating that the plaintiff had said at the police station that she had heard rumors for over a year and had only recently discovered their exact address. However, Xu Qian denied ever saying at the police station that she had heard rumors a year ago, saying that she had only learned the truth less than a month ago.</p>
<p>Requesting Severe Punishment</p>
<p>When questioned, both defendants did not deny the adultery. They also stated that Li had given birth to a daughter this year and that they had been cohabitating for so long that the plaintiff must have heard about it. Fang, based on the plaintiff's statement at the police station that she had heard rumors a year ago, believed that there was a degree of condoning and ruled that the plaintiff's case was not accepted. It is said that Qian was dissatisfied with the ruling and will appeal to the police station to file a high suit.</p>
<p>Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association Decides to Collectively Purchase Rice at a Fixed Price</p>
<p>The Group Rice Purchasing Committee of the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai held a meeting yesterday afternoon at the association's meeting room to discuss the first round of rice prices.

<h3>Racecourse Road Kidnapping Case: Inside-Job Leads to Kidnapping. Luo Ahai and One Kidnapper Detained.</h3>
<p>Chuan Qilun, owner of the Lao Yongsen Leather Shop at No. 54 Singapore Road, lived at No. 18, Lane 69, Racecourse Road. At 7:10 AM the other morning, four kidnappers suddenly broke in, carrying weapons, and snatched Chuan's two-year-old son, Yiping. However, as soon as they left the lane entrance, the child's crying attracted the attention of passersby. A pedestrian named Xu Shourong, who lived on Laguna Road in the French Concession and worked at the Wu Jinchang Tailor Shop on Tongfu Road every morning, witnessed the scene and assisted in the pursuit. The Chengdu Road Police Station, upon receiving the alarm, immediately dispatched Chinese Detective Shao Jingfan, Chen Yonggui, and Detective Tian Changchun to the scene. They apprehended one of the kidnappers, Yu Gendi, from Shaoxing, on the spot and rescued the child. The remaining kidnappers fled. He was taken to the police station. Under questioning, Yu admitted that he and the fugitives, surnamed Pan, Chen, and Mao A'mei, were accomplices. It was discovered that Mao A'mei worked as a "hug platform" at the Hexi Peace Gambling House. Luo Ahai, the old clerk of the Lao Yongsen Leather Shop, originally leaked information, revealing the family situation of Chuan Qilun, the owner, and all the equipment in the house. Mao, Pan, Chen, Yu, and others then discussed the kidnapping procedures. It was agreed that if the kidnapping was successful, the ransom would be 50,000 yuan, of which Luo would get 5,000 yuan, and the remaining funds would be divided equally among them. Based on the confession, the detectives arrested Luo Ahai. Yesterday, they were both brought before the criminal court of the Special First Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the above situation and requested approval for detention. Witness Xu Shourong also complained about his situation in helping to pursue and capture the kidnapper Yu Gendi. After Judge Liu briefly questioned the two defendants, he ordered them to be detained for seven days for further verification.</p>
<h3>Two Groups of Robbers Sentenced</h3>
<p>Bao and Qian reported that at approximately 9 AM on the 20th of this month, while transporting 5,000 yuan, they were robbed at the entrance of No. 29 Beijing Road. Yu Yingguang and Zhang Jinglu were arrested at the time. A pistol was found on them. Later, another pistol, which Yu and others had discarded, was found in the China Garden. They were interrogated and detained by the Special First Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefei held another hearing. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that one of the two guns held by the defendants was found to have been stolen from the French Police Department in March and requested permission to return it to the French Police Department. When questioned, the two defendants confessed to the robbery without denying it. The court sentenced Yu to seven years in prison and Zhang to six years in prison. One gun was confiscated, and the other was returned to the French Police Department.</p>
<h3>Guohua Invents Mechanical Shoe Eyelets</h3>
<p>The shoe eyelets on ordinary leather and canvas shoes, though small, have a wide range of uses. All the shoe stores in our country use imported products. The annual consumption is quite astonishing. Because the manufacturing process of this type of shoe eyelet is very complicated, no Chinese has yet established a factory to manufacture them. Mr. Hu Xianghua has accumulated more than ten years of experience and research, and he has repeatedly tested and obtained satisfactory results. Mr. Hu has now opened the Guohua Hardware Industrial Factory in Jintang Village, Xujiahui Road, specializing in manufacturing shoe eyelets to promote domestic products and recover lost profits.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Zou Chengding's Memorial Service</h3>
<p>Mrs. Lu Xiongzhen, the first wife of Mr. Zou Chengding, secretary of the Political Department of the French Police Station, died of illness at the Shanghai Maternity Hospital at Yinshi (3-5 AM) on September 28th of this year. Mr. Zou has chosen December 1st of the Gregorian calendar to hold a memorial service for his wife at the Shanghai Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. Mr. Zou has a wide circle of friends, and Mr. Zou's relatives and friends will all go to express their condolences at that time.</p>

<h3>The General Situation of the Five Major Cultural Undertakings of the Catholic Church in China (2)</h3>
<p>The cataloging of the Xuhui Library is still based on the Siku Quanshu method, divided into Classics, History, Philosophy, and Belles-Lettres, with Collection as its supplement. The detailed entries are also classified according to the Siku Quanshu classification. The catalog has books, with the number of strokes in the last character of each book as an index. There is also a card catalog, divided into three types: book name, author name, and category. According to statistics, there are about 200,000 volumes each of Chinese and Western books. Western books are mostly in Latin and French. The cataloging of Western books is roughly the same as that of Chinese books, with books and cards, and the cataloging method is based on the following categories, with Latin letters as an index: Bible, Saints, Church Law, Theology, Church Ritual, Catechism, Church Resolutions, Church History, Biography, Literature, Science, History and Geography, Sinology, Newspapers and Magazines, Series, and Jesuit Books. Each category is further divided into detailed items for easy searching.</p>
<p>The goal of the Xuhui Library's collection is only to facilitate the research of clergymen, so the facilities are simple and the staff is lacking, making it difficult to open to the public. Initially, there was no intention to form a library, but over time, the collection became magnificent. Since the purpose is to promote cultural exchange, Western books are rich in history and Chinese books are rich in geography, so the Xuhui Library has become a general library. However, scholars are welcome to visit the library for reference with a letter of introduction from a friend. In recent years, the library's storage space has become insufficient, and many people have advocated opening it to the public. However, due to a lack of funds, the new building has not been completed, which is a great pity. During this war, 50-60% of Chinese books were destroyed, and the number of books burned and looted is even harder to count. Although the Xuhui Library is located on an isolated island and has been preserved, this can be a great comfort to those throughout the country who love the library. However, how to expand and develop this library, open it to the public, and fulfill the responsibility of revitalizing national culture remains to be guided and supported by people throughout the country.</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing the Xuhui Library's collection was to research academics. The Hanxue Series is a major expression of research achievements. To date, a total of 66 types of series have been published. The fifth type was originally "Chinese Literature and Examination Records," but is now changed to "Chinese Inland River Fisheries." All series are written in Latin and French, but Latin only accounts for a small number. The research content of the series can be divided into (1) Geography, such as Chongming Island, the Grand Canal in Anhui Province, the Nanjing Map, the Nanjing Commercial Port, the History and Geography of Nanjing, the Map of China, the Map of Western Sichuan, and the Map of Jiangsu Province; (2) History, such as the Cross and the Swastika in China, the Jingjiao Tablet, the History of the State of Wu, the Kaifeng Jewish Stele, the History of the Zhou Dynasty, the History of the Qin Dynasty, the History of the Qing Dynasty, the History of the Han, Wei, Zhao, Chinese Superstitions, the Liang Tomb, Chinese Earthquakes, the Biography of Wu Yushan, the Catholic Patriarchal Genealogy of China, Japan, and Korea, and Biographies of Jesuit Missionaries in China; (3) Philosophy, such as the Philosophy of Zhu Xi and the Philosophy of Wang Yangming; (4) Others, such as Chinese Pawnbroking, Chinese Salt Industry, Chinese Marriage, and Mongolian Written Language, all of which are extremely valuable works. There are a total of 22 authors, including six Chinese, one each from Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, and Belgium, and the rest are French. Among the authors, there is one secular priest, one priest from the Paris Foreign Missions Society, two priests from the Congregation of the Immaculate Heart of Mary, one Catholic, and the rest are Jesuit priests. Unpublished manuscripts include the Collection of Ancient and Modern Surnames, the Chinese-Latin Dictionary, the Ming Dynasty Gazetteer and Map, and the Four Treasuries of National Geographic City Walls, Mountains, Rivers, and Place Names, Qing Yu Di Indexes translations, which are not detailed here.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Education Department Announces the Current Situation of Education in the Province (1) Education in All Provinces Has Made Progress</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondent) Yunnan Education in the past year, due to the establishment of administrative policies, the increase in funding sources, the enrichment of material facilities, the closeness of facility programs, and the concentration of practitioners, has made positive progress in higher education, secondary education, primary education, and social education. The Education Department has specially announced various statistics, and the outline is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Higher Education</p>
<p>The Private Donglu University has added colleges and departments, enriched the content of equipment, and suggested changing it to a national university with increased annual funding to lay a solid foundation for higher education. This year, it also revised the scholarship system for outstanding students in university and specialized courses, expanding the number from 200 to 1,000, and increasing the amount from more than 60,000 yuan to 300,000 yuan in new currency. There are 709 students going to universities and specialized courses in China, most of whom tend to value practical subjects, and the ratio with liberal arts is no longer too different. In the future, in order to make the development of various talents balanced, and to strengthen the cultivation, from this year onwards, in addition to ordinary scholarships, there will also be special department scholarships, specifically used to encourage the study of disciplines that are needed in the province or are lacking. In terms of the number of students in higher education, compared with previous years, it is slightly less, but compared with advanced provinces and regions, it is still much inferior. In the future, it is planned to find ways to encourage students from Yunnan who hope to go to university and specialized courses to reach one-fifteenth of the total number of middle school students in the province (that is, about 1,000).</p>
<p>Secondary Education</p>
<p>Secondary education is one of the main facilities of local education in the province. In the past year, there were a total of 146 public and private secondary schools in the province, with 524 classes and 25,691 students, including 22,668 boys and 3,023 girls (accounting for one-eighth of the total). This year, the number of graduates was 5,308, the number of faculty and staff was 2,139, and the funding was 2,841,165 yuan in new currency. The types of settings are divided into three items: ordinary middle schools set up for college preparatory, normal schools for training primary school teachers, and secondary vocational schools for training agriculture, industry, commerce, and home affairs. Among them, the important statistics of ordinary middle schools this year are 91 schools, including 19 middle schools jointly established with high and junior high schools, and 72 junior high schools, with 18,456 students, including 2,249 high school students and 16,207 junior high school students (2,197 girls, accounting for a little over one-eighth of the total). The number of graduates this year was 3,976, and the number of faculty and staff was 1,382 (including 118 female teachers). The funding was 1,699,291 yuan in new currency. There are 41 normal schools, including 11 regular normal schools, 29 simple normal schools, and 116 classes, including 40 regular normal classes, with 5,366 students, including 1,750 regular normal students and 3,616 simple normal students (141 girls). There were 967 graduates, 500 faculty and staff (21 female). The funding was 712,438 yuan. There are 14 vocational schools, including 1 senior agricultural school, 4 junior agricultural schools, a total of 5 schools, 1 senior industrial school, 2 junior industrial schools, a total of 3 schools, 2 commercial schools, 3 nursing and midwifery schools, and 1 home affairs school, with 53 classes and 1,869 students (29 girls). There were 365 graduates, 257 faculty and staff (32 female). The funding was 424,366 yuan. Judging from the above statistics, the number of normal schools is relatively considerable, but the vocational item is too small. The provincial education department plans to expand it next year. The number of girls attending school only accounts for one-eighth of the total, and efforts should be made to promote and encourage girls to attend school. In the future, the main points of setting up schools should focus on senior high schools, female education, vocational education, teacher education, the balanced development of various regions, mutual adjustment with other public and private secondary schools, the selection of teacher candidates, and the content of equipment.</p>

The organizing committee's full staff has also been decided upon at a meeting the other day. The association, in order to commemorate this unprecedented event in the ping pong world, has arranged not only individual matches but also invited famous female players, including Lin Jinkuan (Hualian), Cai Xiuyu (Qibu), Madame Diffei (Jewish), Feng Mingyin, and Gui Rongzheng (Peicheng), and the five top female players of the Shanghai Women's Youth Team, Zhang Yongru, Hu Jiahe, Wang Guangmei, and Fang Xiuwen, to perform singles and doubles exhibition matches. It has also invited four Westerners from the Jewish Community, including Diffei, Klinmsigai, Fuliutuo, and Madame Diffei, to perform against Qibu's elite players Hu Yiping, Yang Kaiyun, Cheng Shuming, and veteran Chen Linsheng in a series of matches. All performances are extremely exciting. The association is using hardball in this competition in order to attract the attention of all circles. No tickets will be sold, but due to limited space, 400 complimentary tickets with a full program list have been printed. 100 tickets have already been taken by Western groups, and the remaining 300 were given away yesterday within two hours. Admission will be by ticket only, and those without tickets will not be admitted. Yesterday, Mr. Zhang Shunting, the general manager of Shunxing Hydraulic Engineering, sent a letter offering to donate a standard ping pong table. The association is grateful for Mr. Zhang's enthusiasm and has sent a letter of thanks. The order of events for the day after tomorrow is as follows:</p>

<h3>Rats Among the People</h3>
<p>— Nai Liu</p>
<p>Cheng, a child in the second grade of elementary school, hates rats and knows that rats bring no benefit to mankind. Then, a grown person must know even more about the harm rats cause! Rats not only gnaw and destroy clothes and food, but they can also cause fires and bring disease to humans. If we calculate the losses caused by rats to people in monetary terms alone, then the national loss must be in the tens of thousands, not including the loss of lives and the pain of illness!</p>
<p>However, generally speaking, common people have an almost blind respect for rats. For example, if something is gnawed by rats, they simply admit their bad luck and never think of saying anything; sometimes, when they do speak, they always avoid the word "rat" because, according to them, if they blame "Uncle Rat" for damaging their things, then "Uncle Rat" will cause them even greater losses when he starts fires. This attitude of respecting rats while keeping them at a distance is simply baffling.</p>
<p>Analyzing the reason for this "respect" for rats, I think it is simply because people feel they "can't do anything about it." Because nighttime is when people are dreaming peacefully, who wants to stay up all night interfering with the rats' actions? Once it's daytime, they hide in their holes, and it's impossible to interfere. Under these circumstances, ordinary people simply let the rats take free rein, praying in their hearts that the rats won't cause them too much damage! But in reality, how would rats understand your sincerity!</p>
<p>Living beings are always in competition, and those who fail will be eliminated. Everyone should have a fundamental understanding of rats and muster the courage to fight them. (After reading, "Expanding the Rat Extermination Campaign")</p>
<h3>Frozen Corpses on the Road</h3>
<p>— Han Ru</p>
<p>One evening in early winter, the north wind was blowing fiercely, and on the cold and desolate Singapore Road, a large crowd gathered in front of the pawnshop.</p>
<p>"Alright! The corpse hasn't been carried away yet, give us twenty dollars, or we'll drag it back in!" A "police officer" in a black uniform demanded from the pawnshop clerks. (It turned out that a group of gangsters, in collusion with several "police officers," dragged a corpse from the street and laid it across the pawnshop threshold, planning to extort money.)</p>
<p>"Fellow countrymen, please help us, our boss isn't here, we can't make decisions," one of the shop clerks pleaded with the "police officer."</p>
<p>"Hey! You're really ignorant! Just cough up twenty dollars, easy peasy, you mama!" The man, wearing his hat askew and draped in a serge overcoat, spoke in a Jiangbei accent, glaring at the clerk, while the others in the shop just stared blankly.</p>
<p>"Go! Go! What's there to see?" A sharp voice cut through the crowd, and people parted slightly to make way for a man followed by two scruffy fellows. Clearly, this man wanted to remove the corpse.</p>
<p>"Where's the corpse?" the man asked the crowd.</p>
<p>"What are you planning to do with it?" a "police officer" asked the man.</p>
<p>"Just take it away, that's all."</p>
<p>"That's not allowed! Come with me." The "police officer" pulled him aside.</p>
<p>"What's up? Extortion?"</p>
<p>"You bastard trying to extort money, this twenty dollars is for the guys on duty, my brother won't take a penny from you."</p>
<p>"Is twenty dollars enough to make it clean?"</p>
<p>"Yes! Hurry up, now."</p>
<p>The man immediately gave the "police officer" twenty dollars. In an instant, several "police officers" were busy, some gangsters brought ropes and others brought ashes, and they wrapped up the corpse. Then everyone scattered. But the matter wasn't over yet, the "police officer" started reaching out to the pawnshop again.</p>
<p>"Alright! Nothing more to see here, for the guys on duty..."</p>
<p>"Didn't you say twenty dollars covered everything? What's this about duty? I ask you, are they on duty or are they extortionists?"</p>
<p>"Old friend, don't say that, they each make a few dollars, not even enough to eat, you think about it."</p>
<p>"Ah! This is really..."</p>
<p>So another five dollars was given, and only then was the matter settled. The pawnshop spent fifteen dollars, the stone threshold was blackened by the long bar of silver, and there seemed to be no other traces. They closed up shop.</p>
<p>Huo Sang Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Report and Explanation</p>
<p>Huo Sang said to me, "Bao Lang, do you remember the pair of darkened leather shoes in the closet in Miss Lan's bedroom that you tried to wipe clean? Originally, that towel had two uses: one was for wiping knives, and the other was for wiping leather shoes." He wrapped the knife up again in the same way and placed it on Ni Jinshou's desk. "Songquan, continue."</p>
<p>The detective nodded and continued, "When I came back from that alley, the old man had already passed several shops, and the two suspicious men had approached him, so I was actually behind them. But to be careful, I didn't want to rush ahead of them. But the old man walked to a post office entrance and went inside, and the two men lingered outside. Although I couldn't follow him in, this delayed me for about twenty minutes. The old man came out of the post office, and the two men were still following him closely. I had no choice but to stay behind. The old man continued walking, heading towards Datong Road. After entering Datong Road, the four of us maintained the same order as before. I knew these two men had bad intentions. I planned to wait until the old man entered his house on Qingpu Road before dealing with these two men. Unexpectedly, as we approached the corner of Qingpu Road, the two men suddenly attacked, clearly intending to rob him. At that time, I was still three or four yards away from them, and I was about to step forward to intervene when suddenly two shots rang out, and the old man fell on the corner. The two men also turned and fled. These two men brushed past me. If I had stopped them, I could have at least captured one person. But since these two men hadn't noticed me, I decided to simply follow them, thinking I might get better results. They hired two rickshaws at the corner of the north side of Datong Road. Of course, I also took a rickshaw to follow them. They only got out near the Wenmiao Road in the Western District and walked into a thatched house without a door number.</p>
<p>"I identified the location and went to report to the nearby Western District Police Station. District Chief Yang immediately sent four officers with pistols to the thatched house with me. We entered the hut, and the two men were still inside. The one in the Western suit pulled out his pistol, wanting to resist. But we were quicker, and he didn't have time. So we didn't spend much effort and captured a total of four people: one woman and three men.</p>
<p>"We brought these four people back to the Western District Police Station, and District Chief Yang immediately interrogated them. At first, of course, they refused to talk, but after a little trouble, the man in the Western suit told the truth. Their purpose was very simple. They saw the old man exchange a lot of cash in the jewelry store and wanted to rob him. But in the end, they were unsuccessful. They wasted two bullets and just made the old man suffer."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Huo Sang nodded a few times, indicating that he was very satisfied with the report. (180)</p>
<h3>Dreams and Dreams</h3>
<p>— Su Nong</p>
<p>Mrs. Li had a dream again last night, so early in the morning, she excitedly went to "report" it to Mrs. Zhang next door: "Mrs. Zhang! I have good news for you. Last night, I had the same two dreams: I saw the house full of light, and a lot of mice jumping out of the light. Oh, what do you think of betting on 'Fu Sang'?"</p>
<p>"Really? No wonder I see your face full of red light. Didn't you dream of fire? Fire is red, and red is a 'sign' of wealth! Rats, yes, yes, bet on 'Fu Sang'! It's sure to hit! Definitely!" Mrs. Zhang said encouragingly. Because she knew that if she participated in the decision, she would always be able to get some "oil."</p>
<p>"Then, I'll definitely bet a dollar on it. If it hits, I'll treat you!"</p>
<p>As soon as Mrs. Zhang heard "treat," her eyebrows danced with joy. "I'm saying it's a sure thing, Mrs. Li, what will you treat me to?"</p>
<p>"How about treating you to crabs?"</p>
<p>"Good, good! But I'm really embarrassed, again..." She imagined eating the crab, imagining how to use the tip of the crab's small leg to pick out a piece of crab roe, then dipping it in vinegar, and then... she swallowed a mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>So Mrs. Li's only dollar in her pocket immediately "flew" into the hands of "Little Pockface." Because if she was late, she was afraid she wouldn't catch up with the "early post."</p>
<p>"Little Pockface" was the "Hui runner" that everyone in this alley knew. He could get some "dividends" from the winner; as for losing, that was naturally none of his business!</p>
<p>Mrs. Zhang simply stayed in Mrs. Li's room waiting to eat crabs. Mrs. Li was "planning" how to spend the other half of the money besides treating her guest. She thought of buying a few handkerchiefs, buying a piece of clothing material; she also thought of buying two pounds of meat and cooking a big pot of rice to eat her fill; she also wanted to buy...</p>
<p>Mrs. Li smiled. Mrs. Zhang also smiled.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, a familiar sound of footsteps seemed to be approaching, and entered the room!</p>
<p>Their hearts immediately became tense: it was longing, it was fear.</p>
<p>But "Little Pockface" finally poked his head in and said, "Mrs. Li, the 'result' is out!" and quickly withdrew.</p>
<p>Mrs. Li suddenly stood up and cursed, "Dead rat, plague rat! Coming to make fun of me! Next time I see it, I'll kill it all!" And so, just now, the handkerchiefs, clothing material, meat, big pot of rice... all turned into dreams.</p>
<p>She slumped and opened the box, and took out a piece of clothing from inside. Of course, after a while, it would be lying comfortably in the "safe."</p>
<p>What about Mrs. Zhang? She also seemed to have had a "crab eating dream." She sighed listlessly, "If I had known, one dollar would have been enough to buy two crabs!" She couldn't help swallowing a mouthful of saliva. Mrs. Li sighed. Mrs. Zhang also sighed...</p>
<p>"Next time, don't tell me about your dreams..." Mrs. Zhang "warned" Mrs. Li like this.</p>

<h3>Recent Events in the Foreign Arts Scene</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>American movie star Van Johnson, in late October, broadcast a speech in London, saying that the friendship between the British and American people is growing stronger every day. He said: "The entire staff of Hollywood, whether actors or technicians, all love to listen to Churchill's speeches, and also express great respect for the British King."</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>It is heard that there will no longer be any traces of American films in Germany and its occupied territories, including the Czech Republic, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. In particular, the productions of MGM, Paramount, and 20th Century Fox are absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>The German military authorities issued the following statement: "This ban does not apply to the entire American film industry, but only to target film merchants who harbor hostility towards Germany."</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>A cinema in Milan, Italy, recently showed a German newsreel. When it reached the middle, someone suddenly shouted in the darkness, "Long live Belgium!" At that time, the lights were turned on, but they could not find the person who shouted; later, the lights went out, and after continuing to screen for a few minutes, someone shouted again. As a result, they had to stop the screening. It is said that what was being shown was a newsreel depicting the German army's occupation of Belgium.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>Since Japan's war against China has fallen into a quagmire, the people are eager to end the war, and even their emotions are negative and unbearable! In order to inspire the people, the government has recently instructed domestic radio stations to broadcast the first program at 5:30 AM, which is the blowing of the reveille. This is the first time this has happened in Japanese history.</p>
<h3>Trends in the Old Capital's Performing Arts Scene</h3>
<p>— Xique</p>
<p>Zhang Junqiu, one of the four famous young Dan actors, was married on the 23rd at Fushoutang. The bride, Zhao Yurong, is very beautiful and can be called a perfect couple with Zhang. Mao Shilai is performing at the Tianjin Chinese Grand Theater, and specially sent a letter to Zhang Junqiu to congratulate him and apologize for not being able to attend the wedding in person. According to Mao Shilai, his wedding date is on the third of the month, at which time Zhang Junqiu happened to be performing in Tianjin, and could not attend Mao's wedding.</p>
<p>After the "Chinese Advanced Opera School" closed down, the theater affairs director Shen Sanyu tried to raise funds to take over, but after running around, everyone said that the opera school's budget required a monthly loss, so no one was willing to invest, and the landlord would take back the property. It was also very difficult to find another school site for a while, so it was unsuccessful. Currently, the students of the Jade class have been issued graduation certificates by the school. Among them, the only outstanding talent, Li Yuru, has decided to form a troupe to perform, inviting Zhao Jinnian, He Yuqin, Chu Jinpeng, etc. to cooperate (that is, those who often played supporting roles at school). They will go to Shanghai next spring to fulfill the golden agreement.</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng's daughter, Huizhu, has been invited by Zhang Baoru, the resident representative of the Shanghai Xin Xin Stage. It has been decided that she will go to Shanghai at the beginning of next month to perform after Li Wanchun.</p>
<p>Wu Sheng Zhang Yunxi, who performed in Shanghai last winter at the same time as Zhang Yun, was engaged to the younger sister of Chi Shigong (who was recently hired by Shanghai Xin Xin at the same time as Wu Suoqiu). It is heard that they will get married this winter. (Sent from Beijing on the 14th)</p>
<p>(15) Sending the Phoenix Crown</p>
<p>This is a scene from "A Section in the Jasper Kui." The scholar Wang Yulin, using his ears as eyes, suspected that his wife—Li Xiuying—had an affair with someone. On the night of their wedding, he humiliated her in every way! Miss Li suffered mental pain because of this.</p>
<p>Later, the truth came to light, and Wang Yulin returned home in glory. Miss Li, believing that a heartless man could not share wealth, refused the imperial honor! Later, after Yulin expressed remorse and personally sent the phoenix crown; and with Wang's mother repeatedly begging for mercy for her son, the situation finally eased. She asked to take a maid as a concubine, and she herself would only be the nominal wife.</p>
<p>I have seen Cheng Yanqiu perform this in Peking opera, but the surnames of the characters in the play are different: Wang Yulin is Zhao Qixian, and Li Xiuying is Zhang Yuzhen. Unofficial history is not official history after all, and we don't need to examine which is true. (See picture)</p>
<p>(16) Crying at the Coffin</p>
<p>There is a scene in Yue opera called "Crying at the Coffin," which is Pan Jinlian crying for Wu Dalang.</p>
<p>Wu Dalang's death was caused by Pan Jinlian's poison. Then it seems irrational for Pan Jinlian to cry for Wu Dalang. I think the cat crying for the mouse must not have real tears; in fact, Pan Jinlian's crying is real crying. She is using the occasion of "crying at the coffin" to also cry for her own life.</p>
<p>Chats About the Calligraphy World</p>
<h3>Casual Talk on "Jiang Zhu"</h3>
<p>— Ye Jiale</p>
<p>Radio shows dedicated to storytelling always feature "Jiang Zhu," which shows that they have a strong appeal. "Jiang Zhu" is the abbreviation of Jiang Ruting and Zhu Jiesheng, who are now standard storytelling partners. Their reputation is on par with "Shen Xue," Zhu Zhao, and other double acts, but in terms of storytelling skills, they are unsurpassed. Let me talk about their storytelling skills:</p>
<p>Jiang Ruting Because of his ugly appearance, his voice is surprisingly good, so he has won the elegant nickname "West Shi Behind the Wall." His storytelling style is concise and clear, without any scattered or messy flaws. The narrative is in a grand style and is full of scholarly atmosphere. His voice is very sweet, and singing a few sentences is charming, like the famous Peking opera singer Ma Lianliang. His jokes are elegant and not vulgar, definitely not comparable to the blind head-scratching of ordinary "comedians." His character portrayals in the stories are all meticulously portrayed, with vivid expressions. He can tell stories such as "Luo Jin Shan," "Yu Ding," and "San Xiao," especially "Luo Ling Shan" is his best, and the most appealing. Looking at the above, his popularity can last for a long time, which is definitely not without reason.</p>
<p>Zhu Jiesheng is the son of the veteran Tan Ci performer Zhu Yaoting. His appearance is handsome and elegant, with the demeanor of a noble young master. His storytelling skills are completely derived from his family education, so of course they are extraordinary. His signature story is "Shuang Zhu Feng," which is quite unique, but since partnering with Jiang Ruting, this story is not often sung in the storytelling world. His Yu tune is second to none in the current Guangyu Society. The opening songs such as "Gong Yuan" and "Ye Shen Xiao Xiang Guan" resound through the clouds, melodious and pleasant. His expressions and character portrayals are best at Sheng and Dan, while Jing and Chou are not his strengths. Jiang Ruting is a good match for him, truly a green leaf to the peony, complementing each other. Their future is optimistic.</p>
