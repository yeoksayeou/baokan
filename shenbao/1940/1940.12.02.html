<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統昨日薄暮時官稱、美國已以信用款項五千萬美元貸華、總統並稱、政府正思繼續對華貸款、俾達一萬萬美元之總數云、此間接得日汪「協定」已在南京簽字之消息後、立卽將此項貸款消息加以宣佈、羅斯福總統於正式發表關於借款之文吿時稱、「中美當局進行之經濟合作談話已有進展、美政府正考慮以美金一萬萬元之信用放款貸與中國、其中五千萬美元用以購買普通物品者、已經美國政府予以決定矣、」總統復稱、﹁美政府現正設法、俾其餘之五千萬借款得以早日成就、此另一五千萬元係用以保護中國法幣、藉以維繫中美間貨幣之平衡、此種款項刻正由國會之預算委員會予以討論、」羅斯福總統發表正式文吿、謂政府正設法使另一五千萬美元之貸款早日實行、以穩定中國法幣、此次借款使美國自一九三二年起貸華款項之總數包括已借及將借者、達美金二萬四千五百萬元、饅近兩年中、美國貸給中國之款僅一千六百萬元、在昨日宣佈之新借款之前、美國對華之貸款共有八千五白萬元、其中中國已還者達九百萬元、昨日之借款連同此後可借之款、共有美金一萬六千萬元、</p>
<p>羅期福總統報吿、美財畏摩根韜將於星期一日出席參院銀行事業委員會及衆院度量衡委員會之聯席會議、報吿目下建議之擴充信用借款五千萬元一案、外交界及國際界均認此時此際之借款、意義甚爲重大、衆意以爲美國力圖抵消日本承認注精衛組織後之任何嚴重影響觀察家回憶美國每於日本作有損重慶中國國民政府之動作時、採取若干有利重慶之步驟、漢口陷落時、美國首次大量予華以貸款、縝緬公路封鎖時、美國則對日本禁運若干其所必需之村料、最近日本將行加入軸心國時、美國卽宣佈將予華以新借款、目前中國方遭遇有利之局勢、美國復作此項援助、中國之有利因素包括（一）美國陸軍力量在太平洋之加强、（二）英美澳關於新加坡曁其他太平洋地帶之防守談話、（三）英國海軍地位在地中海之增强、英首相　吉　謂此舉足以影響英國在地球其他遼遠部分之權力、查中美間此項新貸款、係由駐華盛頓中國大使胡適氏曁宋子文氏會商者、宋子文爲中國銀行董事長前任中國財政部長、又聞該項新援助之大部份、其中六千萬美金聞並非借款性質、而爲由華輸美伺値之貨品之一種貿易辦法、觀此足見美國願意與中國維持商業之接觸、而且可依賴中國之主要原料、以增進美國之防禦地位、（一日合衆電）</p>

<p>紐約　級約「泰晤士報」今日載稱、美國將貸款中國一事、乃羅斯福總統當選第三任總統後第一次之重要外交行動、美國此舉不但希望能藉以鞏固中國抵抗日本之力量、且亦鼓勵蘇聯繼續援華云、（一日路透電）</p>

<p>重慶　此間官方　聞貸華美余五千萬元之訊、均極爲歡迎、稱美國此舉足以爲昨日南京所締東京南京經濟軍事條約之對抗、官方稱、此新借款係美國對中國抗戰所予政治及道德之贊助、而不可認為應中國急需之接濟、因尖國之第二次之貸款尙未完全用罄、而第三次之貸款且未動用分毫云、（一日合衆電）</p>

<p>國務赫爾院昨在新聞記者招待席上評論日汪條約、謂美國當然繼續承認重慶政府、其言曰、三月卅一日余曾發表廣泛之基本言論、凡中日事件之仟何階段皆可適用之、余以爲最好請諸君覆查之云查赫爾前言係汪政權成立時所發表者、內稱、此爲一國以武力加諸鄰國、並阻塞其對於世界他國尋常政治輿經濟關係之程序中又步一驟、日本希圖成立一種制度、使日本獨佔優勢、而剝削美國與其他第三國所久享平等公允待遇之權利、汪政權成立之情形、與日本所稱渠將尊重中國政治獨立之言論不相符合、重慶政府獲有中國人民大多數之擁護與贊成、美國政策始終不變云云、</p>
<p>以一般言、此間人士皆謂汪精衛致重慶之感電、僅爲一種手續、未有答覆之價値、昨日簽字之日汪條約由中國境內通信社傳來者、明白表示日本未有在任何時撤回在華日軍之意、因汪精衛與日人皆不能戰勝重慶政府也、故所謂中國各處完全和平恢復後兩年撤兵云云、渺茫無期、目遠在適合情理的預期之外、此間人士並謂H本今方積極設法欲與共產總樞紐所在之莫斯科握手言歡、如果所謀成功、則日本對於中國境內之共產軍、卽日本听謂其利益與思想與莫斯科共產彼此相同者、勢必亦與之同樣握手、然則日本何以欲得一防共區域、俾駐兵華北乎、（一日路透社電）</p>

<h3 id="c7">遠東危局的新節段 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>近幾日來、關心遠東機運的人們，大都以緊張的心情，佇視着可能發生的演化；一若暗幕中導演的一切，或將有驚人的姿態與割期的影響；乃及至暗幕揭開後，所呈顯到眼前的，絕沒有娓娓動聽的新聲。到只是耳熟能詳的濫調。更觀形態所表現，竟令人無從理解個中人具何心理，如何自解。</p>
<p>中日間的問題，有其內在的因果，亦有其必然的歸趨。由於天然的與人爲的種種條件，中國的獨立解放與日本的大陸政策，適形成針鋒相對，不能並存；亦即在日本大陸政策之中，中日戰事的爆發成爲無可避免；這是歷史的悲劇、也是歷史的必然。誠非待侵略與奴役企圖絕跡於遠東，則其間絕無和平可言。是以在中日戰爭事實久已存在的過程之中，縱屢有形形色色的別調揷曲點綴其間，結果旣不能撼動戰事的主流，亦無以改變兩國相互關係的本質，其勞而無功能，徒成笑柄，原屬必然的事。</p>
<p>然而在這總的必然中間，也未嘗不包孕着奇詭的矛盾。據前日日外務省的聲言：其所簽訂的「協定」並非「和平條件」，僅在原則上規定「中」日關係：則日方對於此一協定的估價，顯然並小太高，而且即在協定本身之中，亦復肯定了戰爭行爲繼續的必要：然則又何爲以御前決定，樞密審查，並以前任閣揆之尊。涉洋往返，徒以促成無改於現實的這一文件？這究竟是足裨侵華戰事，抑或有補日本時艱？以言和平，則尙在不可知之未來，以言實效，並不能超出日軍控制地區之外。僅於廿一條之外爲日本外交史留F更深更大的汚點，且令人感到日本當局並未因無數經騐敎訓而變得聰明。至於其所表現於現實者之與前此所屢見諸約言者之大相逕庭，則更沒有細加指摘的必要。</p>
<p>當不久以前，日方的和平攻勢一度萌芽的時候，一般人雖根本置疑於日方的本意，但却也未嘗小期望其幸能更淮而出於覺悟與悔禍：良以日方處境，際今已無往而不屆於窮途；毀滅超昇之間，僅系一念之差，如其稍具健全理性與常識，當必能憬然於此輕賭國運之有類狂易。乃松岡計劃暴露之際，秣陵所進行之不愉快的一慕即已同時在導演中，前後不足二十日間，而召開御前會議樞密會以迄於阿部挾其密策以再度來華，步驟均密相踵接，絕無猶豫餘裕以表示其對於和平攻勢之效果尙復有所期待，則適足證明松岡所表示之一切，僅類烟慕，初非由衷、而目前所實現的一切，纔是日方本意之所在。像這種恍恍惚惚而又慌慌張張的和平攻勢以至與之相輔的外交攻勢，自今當即永絕葛籐，再不能用以眩惑內外視綫，也更沒有與軍事行動相互配合以謀一逞的可能了。</p>
<p>四部十九條的文字，雖在事實上不能有新的意義與作用，但却證實了十個月前另一相類文告的眞實性，同時亦可見日本滅亡中國企圖之前後一貫，絕未因時間與環境而有所變更，而隱藏在含蓄且富有伸縮性條文之下的嚴重性質，也並不能因別有幾個堂皇術語的存在而獲得遮掩。這一事實，不但將遠東問題更在中國人民心理上投擲重大暗影，確認抗建成功纔是唯一出路，同時亦復刺激國際聽聞，並激激起嚴重的反響。昨日一日之內，除却英美兩政府的正式聲明之外，美國更宣布對華一萬萬美金巨額貸款之成立。此皮借款性質顯已由商業借款漸進於政治借款的範圍，這無疑是日本對華新行動所引起。在日本也許早已準備孤注一擲，對此種種，不復介意，但若爲其自身實際利害打算，怕也未必就認爲心安理得吧！其另一方面，却又斤斤於所謂一共向防共與蒙疆駐兵，又可見其聯蘇政策至今毫無進展，因此小能放鬆反蘇的配備。但是今日之日本雖支絀萬分，其最近之種種佈置，郤適證明其南進行動已如箭在弦；如果說其積極導演最近對華一幕也有其積極用意，那便是要確立其對中國淪陷區統治與榨取的「合法」地位與具體力策，以便利用中國經濟潛力，騰挪在華軍力，以別向發動新的冒險；試看其特別着重於經濟資源以及財政企業貿易交通等項，不厭詳予厘定。可知其大慾所在，而此等掠奪之確保，自然只有在日方鞏固其控制之下纔有可</p>
<p>最近的事實證明了日本新的冒險已在實際開始進行，其實際所能加於中國的損害雖並不能超越其軍事活動範圍與業已實現的程度以外，但對於遠東，甚至對於全世界，郤發出了一個共見共聞的警號。</p>

<p>德軍擊敗法國後，何以坐失兩個月的寳貴光陰，未能乘勝直搗英倫三島？各國軍事專家對此問題，尙在硏究中。本文是美國「星期六晚報」駐歐訪員貝斯Demaree　Bess的觀察。他在德軍開入巴黎前後，始終留駐該處，對於德軍後方情形，看得很淸楚，茲將他對該報的無綫電吿報譯錄於後：</p>
<p>從本年六月中旬到八月中旬，前後兩個月，德軍攻英之戰，事實上趨於停頓。若論天時，這兩個月是用轟炸機作戰最適宜的時期，在此生死存亡的鬭爭中，或可決定勝敗，亦未可知。然而德軍一任時光消逝，並未乘機對英國施行閃電戰，却是何故？</p>
<p>軍事家對於德軍的暫時靜伏，曾舉出許多戰術上的說明，但據目睹德軍佔領下法國一切演變的人看來，這種戰術上的說明尙嫌不足。德軍最高司令部甘心犧牲這寳貴的八個星期，實際上尙有兩大原因。第一是他們把央國估計錯了。第二是德國正在歐陸h採用「馬戲團訓練野獸」的辦法　凡是有經騐的人都知道捕捉野獸並不甚難，但要使牠們馴伏，使牠們能供人驅使，倒不是件容易的事！</p>
<p>六月中，在法國請求停戰後不久，德國一張新聞片映着希特勒在前綫接受法國的請求。兩旁將士環列，那位獨裁者輕鬆的走着跳舞步子，得意忘形地喊道「大局定了！」</p>
<p>這句出自希特勒口中的內心話，命意何在，我們或許永遠不會知道。他自詡有先見之明，可以觀察到千年後的歷史，總不見得說他的帝國已經從此創建完成了吧！何况他喜讀古代帝國歷史，定會知道建立帝國的大事，乃是椿永無盡期的呢。</p>
<p>可是說希特勒相信法國的崩潰，卽是西綫戰事的終了，倒也近似些，至少法國佔領區內德軍將士有此感想。他們已定於七月十四法國民主紀念日，舉行一個慶祝勝利的大遊行，當時巴黎便成r籌備的中心。</p>
<p>巴黎市民，人人都聽到這遊行的消息的。佔領軍的第一道命令，便是沿遊行的路綫撤除沙袋障礙物，恢復沿街噴水池，以壯觀瞻。軍樂隊練習奏演，飛機在巴黎h空演習陣勢。所有放館都被徵用，旅館經理並聽說德國人來法觀光的有五萬之多。</p>
<p>我們F榻的小旅館，這時候也由德軍一隊佔用，司令官還算客氣，允許我們暫時留住在內。</p>
<p>他的副官講英語很流利，却說摩根小姐和她救濟團體中的工作人員必須遷出，他請內子在他們遷入以前，先把室中視察一過。</p>
<p>他說「我們要你去察看室中的物件，更希望你不憚煩勞，在我們離去時再檢點一下，吿訴摩根小姐並沒有短少一件東西。」</p>
<p>我們問他「你們多久纔能離去呢？」</p>
<p>他吿訴我們「那是不會久的，戰事差不多已完了。」</p>
<p>可是到了法國民主紀念那天，並無慶祝勝利的遊行，在此後數星期中也一無舉動。軍樂隊和表現的飛機已很少見，德國人來法觀光的消息已小再提起了。徵用的旅館有許多已經發還。巴黎的德軍人數也漸漸減少了。</p>
<p>到底發生了什麽事呢？聽說德國曾向英國提出和議條件，過了不久，卽被英國拒絕了。關於德方的建議，後來有一位德軍參謀曾約略相吿。他說，德國須在歐洲大陸有絕對統治權，英國不再過問歐事。至於歐洲以外，德國除要求歸還以前德屬的菲洲領土和一條橫跨菲洲中部的狹長地帶，此外別無所求。</p>
<p>在德國人心目中，這些條件顯然很是寬大合理，英國竟加以拒絕，不能不使他們表示驚異在他們對於英國人，所謀輒左，這是父一次了。他們對於他人的估計，常能十分準確，但是英國人總使他們莫測高深。一九一四年時，他們不曾料到英國會參戰。一九三九年侵略波蘭時，他們又未曾料到英國會對德宜戰。今夏建議和平，更未曾料到英國居然會不瞅不睬。</p>
<p>法國屈服後一個月，德國方始了然於英國的繼續作戰，具有決心。他們這時巳不得不同時應付兩重困難：一方面必須賡續進攻央倫三島，一方面又須鞏固歐洲大陸佔領地。有一忽略，便會全功盡棄。</p>
<p>若說德軍要在同時應付十幾處戰事，這並不是故甚其辭。在每一個被佔領的國內——特別是法國——德國人都遭到複雜的內鬨，實際上已是釀成內亂，僅未表面化而已。德國人很明白他們非特不應令私鬭成爲明爭，且要使親德派處處居於上風。這是一件難事，所以德國人不得不在寳貴的六七八三個月之中，殫精竭慮，以固後方。</p>
<p>在法國等處的內鬨，並非是德軍侵略所造成，他們不過使內亂加劇罷了。階級和階級，團體和團體，個人和個人之間，種種衝突，醞釀已非一朝一夕。法國的慘罹浩刧；就因大敵當前，而無法消除閱牆之爭，以致不可收拾，法國軍隊和政府的混亂不堪，大部份由此造成。固然，在戰爭期內，這種內亂可以幫助德軍不小，但是法國旣降，便成爲德國肘腋之患，不能漠然視之了。</p>
<p>六月以來，因爲撿查嚴密，交通梗阻，法國內亂的事，外間便少有傳聞。就是法國人，也多數不知其重要發展，必須把各方消息，參照推敲，並和局中主要人物談話，方能得其梗概。</p>
<p>法國的內亂，界限並不分明。有人以爲這是保守派與進步派之爭，民治主義與極權主義之爭，共產主義與法四斯主義之爭，第五縱隊與愛國志士之爭。其貫紛爭的中心，並不是愛國不愛國的問題，而是見解的問題。（未完）</p>

<p>— 康沙</p>
<p>近來爲了種穆原因，上海銀根日呈鬆濫，滙　貼水漸趨消滅，錢業公會所開市拆，每日只有七八分，各銀行紛紛减低存息。這在一方面看，也許說是好現象。但在另一方面看來，危機暗伏，隱憂未已，市面前途，正佈滿着荊棘，悲觀的成分遠過於樂觀成分。而在眼前，正因許多游資，游夾游去，漫無歸束，於是到處有人佈下了天羅地網，來守候你落人陷阱。只　你一個不小心，一交跌了進去，使你萬刧不得復身。</p>
<p>一年以來，賣買洋股，已成爲最時髦的一種投機或投資事業。衆業公所的經紀人，個個笑逐顏開，門庭如市。經紀人一個位置，買到英金一千鎊，尚且求之不得。每日成交少則二三十萬股，多則七八十萬股；每週成交額常在四五千萬元左右。巨額佣金，滾滾落入他們錢囊，而市價的在漲暴跌，極盡波譎雲詭的　事，使盲目從事的中國人士以及太太小姐們，弄得傾家蕩產的比比皆是。</p>
<p>銀根緊，投機者多所顧忌；當此際銀根鬆濫之時，父是投機家及操縱者最好的活躍機會來了。同時聰明的猶太人，便一而再，再而三的利用這個時機，招募新股，以吸收華人的資金，如繼信和紗廠等之後，接連怡和紗廠也宣佈添募新股三十三萬七千五百股，每股價格　十六元，（照票面五兩溢出十九元）每四老股得認一新股。繼之上海毛絨廠，也將於十二月五日上午十時至十時半的三十分鐘內，公開招募新股四十餘萬股，每股票面五元，售價五元五角。此項增資的用途，據說是向沙遜購一方二十三畝的地皮，計英金一萬一千五百鎊，以及興建廠屋等等之用。購上海的地皮，一定要用英金，而且只有沙遜的地皮合用，這興外入無涉，不在話下。不過同時根據它們廣告所載，這决招募新股給付承募人的佣金，爲十三萬一千元，又一次給付發起人酬勞十五萬元，無非令未來的新股東又憑空加重一筆負擔罷了。</p>
<p>喜歡購買外股的人，往往基於公司派息優厚，業務發達，管理穩妥，或主持得人等等原因。不差，我們撤開國民經濟的立塲不說，單就純粹的投資觀點而論，有幾種公司股票，在相當價格之下，確是値得購置。但此只堪與投資者言，不足為投機者道。許多盲目經營的人，在在受人播弄，在價格不合理狂漲時候，他却跟着買進；在價格不合理暴跌時候，他也搶着脫手，結果無不上人圈套，弄得焦頭爛額。</p>
<p>如今我們試把上海外商股要的分佈情形，加以一述。</p>
<p>在上海衆業公所掛牌的股票，種類雖多，但若以系統歸納起來，實在不過數家。茲將較大的幾家系統，分列如左。</p>
<p>沙遜系（安利系屬之）　國際信託　揚子信託中和　英聯　上海啤酒、華懋　公共汽車　祥泰等等屬之</p>
<p>會德豐系　會德豐　鋼業　企業等屬之</p>
<p>麥邊系　上海銀公司　中國墾殖　藍格志　蘇門答臘等等屬之史帶系　恒業　四海　友邦美亞　保太等等屬之</p>
<p>怡和系　怡和紗廠　怡和啤酒　公和祥等等屬之</p>
<p>祥茂系　英法地產　及橡皮種植公司　標地康沙立特　刀米仁　可太把路　怕丁　開達　伯亨　生架笛利　太拿馬拉九家屬之</p>
<p>惠通系　橡皮種植公司　阿爾嗎　英達區　英楂華　伯土安南　志摩陳氏　楂華康沙　卡派揚　克羅華　里派　橡皮信旗　撤嗎格格　西門布　薛納王　馬來　薛蘭班　蕭曼奇士　地傍</p>
<p>橡皮等十九家</p>
<p>系統旣明，吾人再進而一論人的問題。本來一家公司的發達與吾，穩妥與否，全在主持的得人與不得人。所謂得人者昌，失人者亡。上海的一般外商公司，主持人物，儘多精明幹練，信譽卓著的。但是一人的精力有限，應付二三家公司，或許綽有餘裕。若以一人而須過問許多公司的事務，多少總有些勉强。若爲敷衍應酬，處處自居於「也司人Yesman」之列，非所以重股東的屬部，甚或轉啟外人的顧慮。許多人每以中國的闊人，一身兼數十職，資爲談助，誰知上海外籟的紅企業家，也正不讓中國闊老專美於前，不信，試看下列幾位。</p>
<p>台物Dawey（沙遜系）担任下列各公司董事·華懋·中和·國際·揚子·會德豐·利　·正廣和·祥泰·鋼業·上海啤酒·公共汽車·茂泰·上海拖駁等等。</p>
<p>安諾德Arnhold，H．E．（沙遜系）担任下列各公司董事·中和·四海·國際·揚子·祥泰。公共汽車·茂泰等等。</p>
<p>米格Meager（沙　系）担任下列各公司　事·華懋·中和·揚子·國際·祥泰·上海啤酒·公共汽車等等。</p>
<p>阿凡達Ovadia（沙遜系）担任下列各公司董事·華懋·中和·業廣·祥泰·上海啤酒等等。</p>
<p>馬登Mardon（會得豐系）担任下列各公司董事·會德豐·茂春·上海拖駁·企業·鋼業　個際·揚子·　殖·　格志·信和·四海·上海毛絨·恒業·利　等等。</p>
<p>麥邊McBain（麥邊系　担任下列各公司董事·上海銀公司·國際·揚子·藍格志·　殖·蘇門答臘·利　·公共汽車等等。</p>
<p>此外像嘉道理Kadocrie父子及惠而趣Welch之於惠　系　橡皮　權公司，白籣Brand及米勒Meller之於祥茂系　橡皮　植公司分別担任董事，當然不在話下。總之，上海之大，外股種類之多，大多數總逃不出這幾位外國企業家的手掌。</p>
<p>外國公司的經營，因爲方針不同，結果便予股東以不同的影饗。例如上海自來水公司，先命發有英金債劵。在八一三之前，公司當局顧慮滙率或起變化，毅然收回，改發銀元債券。至今股東　惠不淺：否則不但股利無着，連消費者的負祖，至少比現在還要增加許多。這是一個好榜樣。反之，有一家華懋地產公司，在一九三六年將所欠沙遜銀行的國幣九百餘萬元債務，轉合英金五九八，六〇〇鎊，據說轉換的目的，是可以把利息由六厘减至五厘，以輕公司的負担。但在去年年底，這年英金借款，在它的報告表上，已列作華幣三〇，八五四，〇一三元。爲了節省一厘的利息，憑空增加了二千多萬元的債務，照現下情形，不但股東血本無着，連債券持有人的担保也落了空。這種意外的損失，恐怕也非往年投資的人，所能料想得到吧。</p>
<p>股東持有股份，照理應該得有預問公司業務的機會，但在洋商公司是例外的。他們的董事，是事先推定，不由股東推舉的；公司重要事務的興革，也是如此。每年一次的股東會，不過奉行公事，而且時間往往在營業時間如上午十一時三十分舉行之類，許多股東，大都沒有參加的可能。</p>
<p>總之，投資外股非不可能，但必須對該種股東內容有眞切的認識，公司營業有十分的把握，然後方可過問。而利息合算與否，尤與投資値得與否有密切的關係。譬如公用股，如電話之類，固然穩妥可靠，但必欲把價格抬到四五十元之高，以購十元票面的股份，無論　話加價幾成，而合法收益至多不得超過票　八厘，則其爲得爲失，也就不言可知了。</p>
<p>最後一句話，中國正需要廣大的資本，內地許多厚利的企業，正期待着上海的資金去啟發。此外中國自己許多成績良好的公司股份，政府公債，建國儲金券等，均是良好的投資尾閭。深願麻醉着外股的朋友，快些覺悟吧！</p>
<h3 id="c78">論中國農村經濟建設 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 湯嘯雲</p>
<p>中日戰爭已經三年半了，在這長期抗戰的過程中，中國雖喪失了廣大的土地，十數個重要都市，以及無法估計的生命財產。然而，中國不但沒有崩潰反而愈戰愈强，這種被外人嘆爲「奇績」的偉大抗戰，若要探尋其因果，那除了政治·軍事等原因之外，中國國民經濟，——更確切的說，富有彈性的中國農村經濟，無疑的，是中國能够長期抗戰的一個最有力的因素。</p>
<p>中國抗戰之能够歷久不敗，旣是由於農村經濟自足自給的韌性，那末，爲加强抗戰的經濟力量，爲解決抗戰期中的民生問題，爲擴大和改進農業生產，積極推進農村經濟建設在現階段中，自是刻不容緩的要務。</p>
<p>在未論及中國農村經濟建設的主題之前，且簡單地考察一下因戰爭的影響，中國農村經濟究竟起了怎樣的變化。</p>
<p>戰後中國農村經濟之變化</p>
<p>一般的說來，戰後中國農村經濟所發生的變化是很大的。現在且從優佔區農村經濟與自由區農村經濟兩方面加以論述。</p>
<p>A侵佔區農村經濟　在華北華中等侵佔區內，由於戰爭的關係，農村經濟遭受了極大的破壞和摧殘，無數的農村人民逃散和遷移了，農村房舍被砲火焚燬了，農田作物被踐踏與糜爛了，特別是黃河堤岸的被炸　，洶湧奔流的黃水，更淹沒了千百萬個農村田禾，毀滅了無數的生命與財產。</p>
<p>以華中來說，據大陸報的估計；單京滬路一錢，卽有一千餘萬的飢寒交迫瀕於餓死綫上的農民。而華北區內，據本年三月二十七日合衆社電訊；河北省中部，瀕於絕境的農民，計有六百萬人，而河北省東境，行將飢餓而死的農民，至少有四百萬人，此輩農民皆以樹皮草根充飢，所有之貓犬皆已食盡，若千區域內麥苗方長，毫無食物之農民已取其苗充飢。此外農民以水草·木屑·枯梗·棉絮　糠等充飢者，幾遍處皆是，因乏食物而全家自殺者，更日漸增多。由此項農民悲慘的生活看來，已是確證侵佔區農村經濟破產是何等嚴重了！</p>
<p>自然，侵佔區現時並非整個地如此，隨着游擊戰的開展和游擊根據地的建立，特別是由於某些區域之積極進行農村經濟建設實行軍民合作，如士兵在農忙時協助農民佈植·牧牛·除草·收割，士兵空閒時，幫助農民養豬·牧牛·畜羊·種菜等，已使新的農村經濟，迅速在這些地區內逐漸成長和繁榮了。</p>
<p>B自由區農村經濟　在未被日本侵佔的自由區域內，當戰爭的初期，由於沿江沿海的被封鎖，許多大城市之被侵佔農村經濟因農產物的普遍滯銷和農村金融的流通中斷，雖曾一度顯示呆滯狀態，然不久也就恢復過來，並且日益轉入興盛與繁榮之途了，自由區農村經濟的日趨繁榮，可經海關所作的統計數字中獲得證明。如廣西龍州，在一九三八年全年，進口爲二百七十三萬元，出口為四百二十五萬元；一九三九年全年的進口爲三萬萬六千四百三十九萬元，出口則爲五萬萬七千六百零二萬元，出超達二萬一千一百六十三萬元之多，幾乎出超比輸入大一倍。在雲南蒙自，海關的情形亦復相同。蒙自一九三八年，入口爲一萬萬一千四百六十五萬元，出口則爲四萬萬零七百一十八萬元，出超達二萬萬九千二百五十三萬元，輸出幾據輸入的四倍。除龍州蒙自外，如溫州·寗波·柳州等自由區各關的貿易亦均屬出超，而且輸出的差不多都爲農產品。</p>
<p>侵佔區游擊根據地農村經濟與自由區農村經濟，爲什麼會日趨發展和繁榮？在我們看來，這並非偶然的，而是有着很多客觀的因素。</p>
<p>第一，因沿江沿海的交通綫被日本封鎖，許多大城巿的相繼淪陷，外國資本伸入中國廣大農村的吸血管是被割斷了。英美貨流入中國農村的道路是被阻塞了。第二，由於中國民族工業之慘遭破壞，日貨又因中國施行經濟反封鎖不能大量毫無阻礙的傾入，而自由區與游擊根據地農村的廣大人民對工業品的需耍仍舊，在此種情形之下，自然便造成農村手工業重行勃與和農村經濟繁榮的極有利條件。</p>
<p>推進農村經濟建設的前題</p>
<p>戰後中國農村經濟的變化已如上述，但目前應如何利用此種有利條件，來推推農村經濟建設，充實長期抗戰的經濟力量呢？這是個最重要最當前的問題。固然，我們不能否認，抗戰三年來，農村經濟　設由於政府之積極調　和督導，金融界與廣大人民的努力，自由區長村經濟已有相當可觀的成績，但爲使農村趕濟建設　够更迅速而有效的解決不可。則必需：</p>
<p>一，土地問座土地問題，可說是中國進行農村經濟建設，一個最中心而複雜的問題，中國所領有的土地雖異常廣大，但由於中國人口分佈的不均衡，（如有些地方，地小人多，有些地方的土地，却又荒蕪得無人耕種。）和土地所有權大部集中於地主之手，致中國農業牛產力不能强大的發展。戰後政府方面雖已注意及此，但實際上，仍無多大變革，我們認爲目前要推進農村經濟建設，必先解決土地問題，這不但應將戰區難民和人口稠密地區的人民，有計劃的移至邊區，以擴大墾荒運動，即對於各省所有的荒地，亦應盡量設法墾植，以增加食糧和其他物品的生產。此外，政府允應依照總理的「平均地權」主張，更進一步限制土地集中於地主之手。如將農民超過一定面積的土　槪行沒收，而將此項土地與無主之荒地，分配於無地或地少之貧農佃農使用。</p>
<p>二，農村金融問題　農村生產之能否增加，與農民金融之寬裕與吾頗有關係。中國一般農　因耕地有限，田畝的收入很微薄，每個農家只靠幾畝地生活，即使沒有水旱災荒，其收入想維持「五口之家」的生活，已極感不易，由於農民平時的貧乏，有很多無法存儲隔年的種籽，當新糧收穫後，即立刻賣出以償還宿債，而以後的生活，就非恃高利貸維持不可。於是背負更重，而農民的經濟亦愈益困迫。</p>
<p>抗戰後自由區農民負担，不能否認已相當的增加，而侵佔區農民負担，是更加繁重了，雖則財部方面，爲减輕戰時人民負担，曾宣佈廢除一切苛捐雜稅，如淪陷區捐稅完全廢除，戰區各種捐稅予以緩徵或减免。但實際上，此項命令除在一二個省區內已經遵辦而外，却未能普遍地執行。很多優佔區的農民，不但受某方苛捐雜稅的慘酷剝削，而且有某些游擊隊，竟非法的擅自向農民苛徵。允其是一般地主對農民之種種超經濟的剝削與高利貸敲骨吸髓的壓榨，更使無數農民陷於悲慘的困境！雖則戰後銀行相繼內遷，各地銀行亦競作農村放款，但因辦法不善，致低利所放之款，大多被鄉村中地主高利貸吸收，以高利轉貸農民，致農民無法受惠。所以目前要推進農村經濟建設，必須先謀農村金融之發展，澈　而普遍地厲行廢除苛捐雜稅，減租減息，由政府規定貸款之最高利率，嚴行取締高利貸之重利盤剝，關於農民所欠之舊債本息，抗戰期中亦應暫准停付，</p>
<p>三，農業生產技術的改良問題中國農業經營的方法，耕種的技術與器具等，數千年來大多沿襲舊法，而很少有所改進。中國一般農民，對於種籽，肥料，固不知選擇改進，對於害虫亦不知防除。允其是水利，中國不但沒有積極興築水利工程，以利農田，反聽其泛　成災。中國連年不斷的水早災荒，對農村經濟的破壞程度，事實上，並不亞於列强資本的侵略。也正因爲有以上的種種原因，所以中國農業生產力，始終不能有所發展。今後要推進農村經濟建設，發展農業生產力，自必須積極改良農業生產技術，如防制害虫以增加農產量，改良肥料，變更土壤，使瘠地成爲沃田，興築水利工程，植林，使農田不受旱澇之災，獎勵春耕，提倡生產競賽等，使各省縣，各村鎭，均湧起生產運動的犴潮，以增加食糧和其他物品的產量，而鞏面抗戰之經濟基礎，否則農業生產力，是決不能發展和擴大的。</p>
<p>四，農村機構改革問題戰後中國農村經濟建設，直到目前仍不能有令人滿意的成績，鄉村政治機構不健全，亦爲主要原因。現時鄉村中所行的「保甲制度」，多爲土劣地痞等所把持，不但不能用作團結民衆，推動農村經濟建設的基礎，反而成爲這些份子壓迫剝削農民的最好土具，而近年來鄉村中所推行的農業合作運動，亦大多爲這些份子所控制，使大多數的貧農村農沒有辦法參加合作社而努力生產。因此今後要推進農村經濟建設，便須積極改革鄉村政策治機構。假若能將縣以下的行政機構澈底改革，使黨政軍與人民打成一片，密切合作，則阻碍農村經濟建設的惡勢力，不難一掃而淸，農村經濟建設亦必能迅速推進。</p>
<p>農村經濟建設，是整個國民經濟建設運動中最主要的一環，中國農村經濟建設的發展，也即是民生主義最高理想的逐步實現。</p>

<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>九月二十七日美國第三次貸與中國美金二千五百萬兀之後，十片中卽傳美國將積極予華以經濟援助，正與宋子文氏在進行談判中，合衆社並電傳美國瓊斯氏之言，謂中國能接受美國之信用貸款，同時美國正考慮由中國購買新原料，包括若干重要鑛產及某種物品在貸款條件中所未嘗購自中國的，此後貸款的消息雖不絕如縷，但迄無確切的發展。近兩日來華盛頓所傳來的消息，美國的行將再貸鉅款與中國，已有較爲確實的決定。如瓊斯氏聲稱：「中國之處境一日艱難，則吾人一日冀望盡吾人之所能予以帮助」。而二十九日合衆社電稱：對華的新貸軟或將於明日成立，如果展遲，則美國或將採取其他措置，可能的涉及對日作進一步底禁運，以作反對日本承認「南京政府」的表示。</p>
<p>由於日本侵略野心的不死，美日間已成了尖銳的對立狀態，而近來由於日本南進的積極，使得日美在南太平洋上隨時有發生戰爭的可能。美國在利害上爲維持遠東的權益，自然祗有在日美戰爭未發生前，盡力在經濟上援助中國，以牽掣日本在南太平洋上的侵略，則對於美國行將貸華以新借款，當然是毫無疑問的結果。</p>
<p>中國的償債能力，自十月十八日，滇緬公路重行開放後，極爲增强。四川桐油自重慶輸往仰光的每日平均達一百噸之多。據經濟部商品檢騐局的統計九月份桐油自車慶或經由重慶出口的是五，五五三·七五公担，十月份是九，〇九八·四三公担，計增加三，五四〇公担。又據財政部復興貿易公司的收購機構四川桐油貿易公司報告本年六月至十月收購桐油的一萬二千噸，至今年底可望一萬五千噸之數。另據瓊斯氏指稱：中美兩國以前的交易極爲滿意，中國現賡續履行輸出桐油·錫·以及其他物品的義務。夫以中國償債信用之佳，能力之强，何以此次新借款的遲遲而未成立呢？問題的焦點，是在（一）美國考慮若干新原料如重要礦產，向未購取的貨物：（二）美國如何設法於一兩年內向中國將購大量貨品底可能。筆者深信這兩點圓滿解決之後，新借款決會在最適當的時機出於宜布。（完）</p>

<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>鼻烟（一）</p>
<p>烟之中，不用火燃，不用，口吸，只有鼻烟，顧名思義，已知其爲用鼻吸了。</p>
<p>鼻烟之爲烟，係一種帶黃褐色粉末，相傳明萬麕聞（十六世紀）意大利敎士利瑪竇等來華，用以作貢品，而始流行。這的確有其可能性。蓋聞鼻烟之製作，多半爲修道院中神父的業餘工作，其法秘不以示人，所以各個修道院的所出鼻烟，亦各有其不同。鼻烟，當然不外用菸葉作原料，可是他的作料，有的擭以葡萄露酒，有的攙以蓄薇露，用各種的花露果酒，製成各色香味小同的鼻烟。聞其製法，先將菸葉浸以花露，置於甕中，埋於地下，經若干時取出，方始製烟。於是互相品評，爲優爲劣，佳者不易多覯，而名貴一時。</p>
<p>鼻烟不但在中國為十大夫所愛尚，卽在古代　法諸國，一進了大學，就要講究吸鼻烟，足見是上流社會中交際所必需。鼻烟爲是菸葉和花露等成品，所以不脫酸辣的氣味，　卽以一酸頭足爲上品。吸鼻烟的方式，雖同是用鼻，而中西人手法亦不同。西人吸鼻烟，係用　撮鼻烟，搐之於鼻；中國人吸鼻烟，用指輕蘇烟，按捺於鼻孔，而微微吸入之，卽此微微吸入之際，閉目凝思，屛息細辨烟之酸頭辣味之如何，而其優劣以判。</p>
<p>鼻烟因爲縉紳士夫所尚，蔚成風氣，馴致販夫走卒，尤而傚之。朱君嘗語余：觀其用指之手式，可知其吸烟之程度。內行多用無名指；不慣吸烟的，常有用小指去蘸烟。此外用大拇指的，一望而知其爲非雅人，必其所吸的鼻烟劣，故其所取之量多。（未完）</p>

<p>— 安貧</p>
<p>窮，不是自己的罪惡，當然因自己墮落而入于貧窮的是例外。救窮，固有發一點仁心，起而振濟，但也有一部分為自己求功德，種福田，用有形之財物，求無形之福報。至於辦即救窮工作的——即能謂善團之類，並不是一定出財出物之人，無非是出力罷了，可是有不少妄作妄為的，好像他是大施主，大善士，而不念「貪大之功，以為已有」，謂之不詳。</p>
<p>施放棉衣褲，原是哀憐窮休凍死，所以給套禦寒，用心是不錯的。可是如何散給棉衣，此在農村社會，並不是一件難事；而在流動性最富之都市中，恰是不易辦；你以為馬路上討飯的窮，而不念蜷縮在草棚中，亦有不少一窮之至少窮，但住居在屋子內的亦有不少的隱貧，呼食無米，號寒無衣，這日不要講他。</p>
<p>如今一般大善士們能恐有失他救寒的宗旨，又恐馬路上吃紅丸白麵的鴉片鬼，討一套拿去付當作烟本，再繼續來討，所以要設法阻上他不當。遂想出，種辦法來，將施衣分製兩色，棉襖止身與袖，棉褲兩管與檔，均分成灰黑二色，以資識別，并於衣上加蓋戳記，不准當賣。加戳不准當賣，本是老辦法，可是印子儘管如此打，當者自當，賣不受當，賣者不肯買，那末，施衣者原要其穿，受施者亦無法變質了。那知道善團先生，大約是管過幾年窯獄的，看慣了囚犯一身兩色的衣服亦分成兩色；這種奇形怪狀的衣裳，要使人一望而知為施衣，這未免有傷厚道。尤其是佛敎，講平等，發茲悲，偏要如婆羅門敎分出等級來，這種差別成性，不知佛善薩有知，是否不曰善哉善哉！</p>
<p>羞惡之心，人皆有之，穿到施衣服，除了不識羞恥的　外，多少總有些不自在。假使者心中不好過，難道施者心中倒好過麼？如其是好過，那就不是仁者之用心了！我很望辦　的人們，要尊重被振的人格；人總是樣的人，弗要見了有錢的施主們，趨奉惟恐不及，見了乞憐的窮人們，任意侮辱，倒比燒香念佛好得多了！</p>

<p>電話加價是別人家的事嗎？是的，沒有錯。提出這問題的人接着說：「交易所」的人是不在乎這幾個一的。</p>
<p>「我祇是接電話，不需要我化錢。卽有私事，也可揩公司里的油。」說了我覺得自己太卑鄙了。</p>
<p>小學敎師打了個哈哈，「大概就是揩油的次數太多了，所以要加價。」</p>
<p>雖然有些難堪，反攻是不能免的，「既納了月費，就不應該限次　，而且生意好得熱昏，要裝也裝不着，這次加價實在不通！」</p>
<p>「呆鳥！」他敎訓我了，「你為什麼不拿出「公用事業一的大帽子來呢？他們是以「美金」來計算的，雷車，公共汽車，自來水，熱力都加價了，電話自然不能獨免！」頓了一頓，「而　他們的職員工人也常鬧着加薪呢！」</p>
<p>有道理，我暗暗佩服。</p>
<p>「其實，現在不賺錢什麼時候賺錢？」他有點興奮，「那些米蛀蟲，奸商被罵得狗血噴頭而依然我行我素，還不是為了錢嗎？歸根結底，是苦了我們窮小子，這樣加價那樣加價，說是定明天又要加租，米漲到一百塊錢一担。」接着是一聲歏氣。</p>
<p>米，房租，像晴天霹靂，我作不出聲，默默地跨上床，責備自己為什麼談談別人家的事又談到自己頭上來呢！……</p>

<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十二章報告和解釋</p>
<p>這嘆息對於我發生了深切的反應。我覺得物質文明，一方面固然可提高人生的享受，另一方面卻做了人類互相爭殺的主因。我國幾千年來的傳統思想，對於物質方面都採用一種壓抑和輕視的態度。孔子所說的：「士志於道而恥惡衣惡食者，未足與誶也。」這一句話，就可以代表一切。因着這種思想的結果，我們在物質方面固然沒有多大成就，但社會聞爭奪殘殺的現象，也未始不是因此而比較地減少。自從我們的大門給人家敲開以后，這物質落伍的國家。可是我們的物質欲望一經此誘，郤不能因為自己不能生產而同時减低，於是都市社會中的般人，目光都集中在現成的享用上：社會旣然因此而更見混亂，國力也一天天地消損了！</p>
<p>倪金壽倒並不覺得怎樣。他仍摧促着霍桑說：「這老頭兒旣然死了，他的行動的經過，再也沒法可以證實，祇有請你說一說。」　　霍桑道：「他的行動也很簡單。我相信我的片面的猜想，不會怎樣遠離事實。他在十七夜裏把兒子勸回房裏去以後，知道事情已鬧成僵局。他為挽回一部計，也許就下了謀殺的決心。昨天早晨他送兒子出來的時候，大概就悄悄地買了這把刀，打算找個機會動手。情勢上他是不能再長久在麗蘭家中住下去了，所以這動手機人不能久擱，必須急謀實現。昨天早晨他回去時，聽到了余甘棠在電話中恫嚇，認為可以嫁禍於小余，是個很好的機會，所以就定意在昨大夜裏實行動手。」</p>
<p>「昨夜裏他讀罷了報上樓時，天下雨了。他一定認為這又是一個最好的湊巧機會。他上樓以後，當然不能睡眠。他的房間在金梅臥室的隔壁。他等金梅熄燈睡着以後，便悄悄地下樓準備。他到層樓去，推進了麗蘭的臥室。你們都知道伊的房門是不鎖的。他一定曾在伊的房裏出進過幾次，瞧見過有一雙皮鞋在壁櫉裏。他拿到了這雙陸健笙的皮鞋，也許帶上樓去，也許就放在樓梯近邊，等到臨時應用。」（一八三）</p>

<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>——大衆應有的認識——</p>
<p>醫學並非慈善事業。醫學愈發達即民旅愈優秀，其建設亦愈進展，此乃一定不易之理也。夫醫學之重要如此，自非廣集人材及專門設備，精研而廣大之，不克有濟。我國向來之觀念，以爲醫學乃屬於消極的慈善事業，此實大誤，觀於我國醫學之退步，民族之衰落，即可作爲殷鑒，際茲科學日進，當知醫學者乃一種高貴積極的建設事業，其進步與吾，關係及於民族之健康，社會事業之發達，國家建設之進展，凡我國人，其應憬然悟矣。</p>
<p>預防勝於治療：語云「上工治未病，」時至今日，藥石並非萬能，故預防勝於治療。近世如預防天花之牛痘接種發明以來，其造福人類，何可限量，故國有專司，如防疫防癆工作之如何推進，公共衛生之普及運動，健康檢查之必須施行，小則關係及於個人之健康幸福，犬則及於整個社會之公衆安全。故明日之醫學，乃屬於預防的醫學，決非一紙藥方，萬病卽可消除之謂，須知天下無此易事，所謂治療云者，僅醫學中一部份之工作而已。我人最大之目的，爲謁制疾病之發生，最少之限度，爲早期之診斷，若　治病於未發覺之期間，則可事半而功倍，如我國蔓延最廣之肺病，苟能早日施行X光檢查，則診斷於初期，治愈可必，不特個人能早獲健康，同時增進社會經濟力量爲何如哉！故預防疾病，爲吾人理想中之最高峯，迨病發而施治，抑亦末矣，此爲我人所應共同努力者又一也。</p>
<p>大衆享受的醫學：現代的醫學，旣爲改進民族之總柩紐，關係及於一國之　衰，其重要也如此，而一切醫療專門設施之高貴，尤非一般大衆所能担負，故欲求醫學之　步，大衆俱有醫藥之保障，非集中極偉大之經濟力量不可，則「醫藥保險」尚矣。於人民政府及醫療機關間，作一極有嚴密合作之組織，俾高貴的醫學設施，大衆俱可享受得到，不僅人民可獲得正富之診斷及治療，卽醫藥的巨輪，亦可不斷前進，藉經濟之力量，發展而光大之，造福人類，改　民族，胥於是決之矣。</p>
<p>際此國際風雲日急，優勝劣敗，難逃天演公例。我皇皇華胃，旣有其四千餘年之文化光榮歷史，及今而不之圖，則國雖不亡，而我稱族亡矣。欲挽在瀾，非改進醫學不可，非明瞭醫學的立塲不可。嗚呼！干戈遍地，風雨晦明，凡我國人，其　勉之。</p>
<h3 id="c94">室內起居上之冬令衛生　室之注及抗寒之習練 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 仲祜</p>
<p>時屆冬令，一般人因畏冷之故，往往在室內藉火爐電爐及水汀設備等以取煖，在今日煤電川費昂貴之際，其耗費之巨，係屬經濟問題，姑置不論，卽以術生而言，亦實不相宜，蓋習於溫暖，必致减弱耐寒力，偶至較寒之處，卽易受感冒，且如室內過暖，亦往往使人頭昏腦脹，幾乎不能爲用腦之工作也。</p>
<p>其實人體自身正如一小火爐，陸續放散溫熱，爲一種發熱體，恰與小火爐同其作用，不過其溫暖，難於自知，須觸他人之身體而後知之，如多人共蓋一被，卽可得相當溫暖，故貧民實不期然受有自然之恩惠，嬰兒之於母，亦互以天然之湯婆子，而爲其愛之連鎖，如有多數人叢集於小室中，卽無火爐，亦覺有相當之溫暖，以此關係，故室內如有多人同起居者，卽無暖室法，亦決不覺寒氣之可畏也。</p>
<p>一般暖室法，雖能使人减弱對於寒氣之抵抗力，而易於感冒，或因室內過暖，而致頭昏腦脹，减少其工作之能率，但此皆尚非最有害於人體，其最有害於人體者，實爲換氣法之不良，卽密閉其室，與戶外新鮮空氣隔絕，而使人於不良之空氣中生活是也。　電爐火爐水汀等，如能增加一種設備，亦不難將室外新鮮空氣，直接溫暖送入室中，卽可成爲理想的換氣式暖室法而補救其缺點，且如電爐水汀等，卽換氣式稍不良，亦尚不致使人中毒，最不堪者，爲室旣密閉，又用無烟囱之白煤爐煤氣火爐或煤油火爐等，此則最易使人中毒危及生命，夫以取煖之故，而或罹中毒之患，是則又何貴乎取煖也。</p>
<p>上述換氣式之暖室法，係爲一般不能省免暖室而補救其在衛生上之缺點者而言，至於普通人家，一切暖室法，竊以爲均可屛除不用，旣免耗費，且於衛生，亦極有益，每屆冬令，在有日光之時，卽將窗戶洞開，仟日光射入，曝於其中，卽覺遍體溫煖，此自然而不費錢之取暖法也。卽在無日光之時，亦不將窗戶關閉，如眞覺寒冷，祇須增加衣服，卽可抵抗寒氣，夜間就寢，亦開窗如故，惟對於風可直接吹至床上之窗，則關閉其一二，如是者數十年皮膚與寒氣相習，每至冬令，不但毫無瑟　之態，且亦絕少感冒，用敢以經騐之所得，爲讀者告，藉作冬令居室衛生之一助也。</p>
<h3 id="c95">冬令流行疾病及其預防 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 階泰</p>
<p>令流行而易患之疾病，以呼吸器病為最多，因冬季氣溫低降，空氣乾燥故也。茲略述冬季各種流行而易患之疾病如下。</p>
<p>鼻那答兒：此因寒冷作用於鼻粘膜，引起局部貧血，再由平時卽附於該處之細菌，乘機發難，而起此症。</p>
<p>喉頭炎　患此症時，喉頭部有乾燥瘙癢燃燒狀疼痛狀等種種異常感覺，有如犬吠之獨特咳嗽，同時聲亦變嗄，輕者祇聲略變，重者聲喑如啞，或無熱，有熱亦不高。</p>
<p>氣管枝加答兒：先息感冒，决起此症者爲多，其主要症狀爲咳嗽，在　病之初，有兼有痰痛之頑固空咳，謂之乾性咳嗽，隨病之經過，此種咳嗽，决第消失，咽喉漸有痰喘，咯痰漸增，此謂之溫性咳嗽，咳嗽爲一種欲將氣管枝加答兒所分泌之痰，咯出體外之動作，故迫醫生以藥止其咳嗽，實屬錯誤之要求。</p>
<p>肺炎：肺炎爲重篤之病症，的有二種，一爲加答兒性肺炎，一爲格魯布性肺炎，皆有高熱，咳嗽，咯痰，呼吸迫　，胸痛等，常人殊難辨別，但若見突然以高熱胸痛呼吸迫促發病，咯出銹色痰者，卽可視爲格魯布性肺炎，此症無論成人小兒皆可患之，爲直接侵犯肺組織之病，反之，加答兒性肺炎，係先患氣管枝加答兒，其炎症次第進至深部，終而侵及肺組織，於是發生肺炎者，此概爲小兒或老人之病，壯年之人，較少患者。</p>
<p>白喉：此係白喉菌粘附於咽喉，漸决蕃殖，生出白斑點，其處所生之毒素，由血流而及全身，因而發熱，此症須注射血淸，以愈早愈有效力。</p>
<p>百日咳：由白日咳菌而起，爲小兒之病，水滿三歲者，允多患之。一度患此，卽得免疫性，但亦有例外，而再度患之者。本症之咳嗽，於連續無數短咳之後，作一有聲之長吸氣，爲其固有之特徵。</p>
<p>流行性感冒：寒冷作用於人體，使其抵抗力减退，而有以前竊踞於呼吸器粘膜之細菌，乘此會，突然爲發病之原，是爲感冒，而流行性感冒者，俗稱重傷風，較普涌感冒爲重，由「因夫爾燕薩菌」而傳染，爲極有傳染力之一種病症。</p>
<p>欲豫防以上各症，當於平時作適當運動，鍛鍊體格，並攝取富於滋養及各種維他命之食　，使身體强壯，而增進其對於疾病之抵抗力，劉於一般衛生法，亦須注意實行，多人麕集之處，宜少涉足，暖寒亦不宜多居，如在病症流行極盛之時，出外可帶口鼻罩以免傳染，倘爲預防傳染白喉，則可施行豫防注射，以策安全。至若已經患病，則宜立卽就醫洽療，愼勿遷延，而自貽伊戚也。</p>
<h3 id="c96">談談冬令食補 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 黃肇平</p>
<p>飲食物中，如牛奶，鷄蛋，魚肝油，動物肝等，在冬令中都可把它當作補品看待。</p>
<p>牛奶含有蛋白質，脂肪，乳糖，卵黃紫，磷，鈣，鐵，以及重要發酵素等，在飲食物中品質堪稱第一，多飲品質佳良的牛奶，可使體重增加得很快。</p>
<p>鷄蛋，每天吃中等大的兩個，每個重的五十瓦，可以充分補充人體內需要的蛋白質——蛋白質是人體內主要的營養品。且卵黃所含的丁種維他命很豐富，兒童日吃一二個，可以防免軌骨病，增進　育，所以鷄蛋更可把他當作兒童冬令進補的恩物。</p>
<p>魚肝油含有甲種維他命和丁種維他命，比目魚肝油所含的丁種維他命最多，比鰲魚肝油要多一百倍至一百二十五倍，服　功效和卵黃差不多，冬令是進服魚肝油最好的時期，每天如服適量的魚肝油，不但可免發生夜肓症，眼乾燥症，角膜，軟化症等，而且可使身體强壯，對於傳染病的抵抗力增强，允以兒童服後，最易發育長大，最見功效。</p>
<p>動物肝中，允以小牛肝是第　級的造血劑，同時父富含維他命，所以在冬天要補血的話，不妨多吃肝類食品。</p>
<p>不過在現時生活高潮中，上述的幾種飲食物，因爲價格比較的昂貴，除了一般資產階級可以有力享受外，其餘薪水階級和無產階級中人，實在有些吃不起，但是窮苦人如果也想在冬天補補身體的話，却也不難，因爲無論怎樣窮苦，飯總不能不吃，那麼請從冬天起，首把白米改吃糙米，糙米不但含有抗脚氣性的乙種維他命，同時還含有促進發育性的維他命，實在是窮人的一服大補品。而且價格多少比白米便宜些，也是一個經濟辦法。</p>
<p>在飲食品方面，窮人雖然吃不起牛奶，却可把豆腐漿和豆類食物來代替，德國人正把大豆當作牛奶看待咧！</p>
<p>至於小菜方面，如現在所有的捲心菜菠菜，以及其他含有綠葉素的菜蔬，都含有豐富的鐵質，鐵質可以補血，所以把上述各種菜蔬用作日常的小菜，不但價格比較低廉，且在自然中也可得到補血的功效。</p>
<p>一般經濟力是薄弱的人，如果能照上述辦法，來做飲食物的準則，那麼從食物中求補，可稱爲惠而不費！</p>
<p>末了，我還要附帶申說一下，我們求補的目的，無非在增進健康，所以祇須多吃健康上所需要的食品，便適合進補的目的，倘若殺鷄打鴨！大魚大肉，吃個不了，以爲非如此不補，那麼祗可算恣意口腹，縱然吃得腦滿腸肥，可是因此而使體內脂肪蓄積過多，非但無益，反而有害，就深背食補的眞諦了！</p>
<p>樂　福麥乳精暢銷　本埠白克路九福製藥公司發行之樂口福麥乳精，係國內首創滋補飲料，服後能於短期內發揮滋補能力，奏其補身補血補腦補　之功效，本埠各療養院多有採爲住院療養者之日常調養飲料，聲譽之隆，可見一斑，該公司爲發行樂口福麥乳精三週紀念，已定於十二月八日在本報發行特刋　以　各界讀者，此外尚有新出品樂口福滋養餅干，內含各種維生素，滋養豐富，有輔助消化，促進食慾之功，美味鬆脆，凡小兒發育不全及病後產後失調等等，食之最爲相宜。</p>
<h3 id="c97">進補應與運動並行 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 查瑞龍</p>
<p>因爲　表面看來，進補與運動，好像是漠不相關的兩件事，所以注意運動的人，往往誤認進補爲非必要，而進服補品的人，也多以爲藥物萬能，而不措意於運動。</p>
<p>其實人體猶機器，機器不用則銹，所以祇進補而不運動，至多造成肥胖的身體，和蹣跚的步履，而決不能使體格堅强結寳，苟僅從事運動而不知營養培補，結果如同久經使用而未嘗加油或檢騐，修理的機器，必然是易於磨損，終且有不堪使用的一天。</p>
<p>筆者，二十年來，始終保持堅强體格，從未爲疾病所困擾，自問雖由於鍛鍊所致，實亦得力於營養，因爲筆者，初亦勤事運動，但疾病叢生，瘦弱依然，嗣後經國術前輩指導，一面注意營養，一面致力運動，兼籌兼顧，不稍間斷，頑軀始得日臻强健，因知進補與運動二者，實在是相得益彰，不容偏廢。希望愛好運動的人，同時注意於身體營養。並且希望服用補品的人，對於運動，允其是輕而易舉人人可練的簡便運動…新技擊中的前六式…也須加以相當的重視，因爲新技擊，是一種不費時，不費錢的强身術，練習起來，非常簡便而有實效，所以祇要每大有十數分鐘的練習，已經足够的了。</p>

<h3 id="c98">老年之衛生 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 丁福保</p>
<p>吾人身體之健康　壽，得　於重要器官之强健，居多，如各種之內分泌腺，心臟，血管系統，肺臟，胃腸等之强健是也。　精神　憂鬱煩惱亦必折减壽算，故凡事必須樂觀，有相當之娛榮及休養，能　精神快樂，最爲扼要。至於其他之生活習慣，必須事　合乎衛生，方可保持各重要器官之强健。及至一人老年，尤應善加攝養，庶幾克享　顧。茲將衣食住行之衛生，分條論列如下。</p>
<p>衣服：老年人之衣服，宜求輕暖。材料可用呢絨，或用絲棍，衣服之裁裟，宜較寬闊。襯衣宜用棉布，並時時更易洗滌。棉被宜常曬太陽，老年人因動作不活潑，故手足均苦寒冷，宜注意保暖。</p>
<p>飲食：於飲食前當洗洗手。飲食宜數而少，不宜頓而多。每日空腹時，食　米煮淡粥（香稻更佳）一甌，能推陳致新，生津快胃，所益非細。老年人最相宜之食物爲牛乳·豆漿·白脫油·（牛油）鷄蛋·糙米·綠色菜蔬·橘柑·香蕉·蘋果·葡萄·番茄·淸魚肝油等。食時必須緩緩咀嚼，多費時間，不可迅速嚥下。父宜將食品切細，或煮爛，使少需咀嚼。食後有微滓留齒隙，最爲齒累，宜以牙籤剔淨，再煎濃茶候冷，連嗽以蕩滌之。早晚　宜刷牙，最爲有益。飲料以用溫熱者爲佳，不宜用冷者。在進食時，亦宜　羹湯。老年人如嗜烟酒者，吃少許無妨，能不吃　佳。强烈之雪茄，對於心臟有害，尤不宜吸。此條卽少年人亦宜奉行。</p>
<p>起居：老年人最易疲勞，故室中宜備躺椅，以供隨時偃臥。如思睡者，不妨卽睡，可使身體得完全之休息。允其飯後小睡，最爲　益。夜間之安眠熟陲，最爲切要。若少寐者，宜在上牀時，將一切營爲計慮，舉念卽除，漸除漸少，漸少漸無，自然睡得酣暢。老年人之臥房，宜擇　淸靜之處，而冬暖夏凉者爲佳。窗宜常開，開窗之大小，與風力之大小，天氣之熱與寒，爲反比例。又宜保持華氏六十四五度之室溫。</p>
<p>運動：老年人雖然筋肉已衰，仍宜有相當之運動。適於老年人之運動，以緩步爲宜，每日有一定之時刻，出外散步，對於健康上，極有益處，能使精神爽快，增加食慾，幷使大便通暢，夜間亦能安睡。有時不能至較遠處散步，在屋　屋後步行數千步，亦極有益。散步者散而不拘之謂，且行且立，且立且行，有一種問暇自如之態者也。</p>
<p>疾病：五十以上之老年人所易患之疾病，有中屬（腦溢血）慢性腎臟炎及癌，前二種病之發生，大都爲少年時多吃酒肉，致血壓高，血管變硬，其補救之法，宜實行深呼吸，多吃水果蔬菜，戒絕葷腥，血壓自然下降，患腎臟炎者更官减少食鹽，或竟完全食水果蔬菜，苟能持之有恒，則可預防中風及慢性腎炎之症，不難日漸痊可，惟癌症則尚無辦法。</p>
<p>其他：老年人欲使大便通暢，宜多吃水果蔬菜，或每日有一定之運動以調節之。有時若苦便秘，亦可用浣腸方法，使之通利。陽中之積糞如不不日出淸，則患糞中毒，血管更要硬化，故抱朴子曰，欲得長生，腸中當淸，欲得不死，腸中無滓。</p>
<p>老年人於天氣開朗之日，宜有數小時曝於日光之中，可使血循環佳良，新陳代謝機能旺盛。其法先脫去上衣，用濕巾　身體拭凈，然後曬於陽光之中，惟頭部宜用物遮好。此法雖在冬日亦可行之。</p>
<p>老年人精神衰竭，故事事易於憤怒，一憤怒則各種內外分泌腺，皆停止其分泌液，故最爲傷身。所以當以一耐字處之。或人情世態，尚不能看透，稍稍介意便卽生忿，忿則無損於人，徒損乎己。或財產一關，不能打破，終日縈懷，其勞彌甚，不知來日無多，雖堆金積玉，將安用之。總之一切功名富貴，田地房產，法書名畫，恩愛怨仇等皆宜放開，惟勤修布施持戒忍辱精進禪定般若等六度功德，即所謂留得住，帶得去底事也。</p>
<h3 id="c99">痰和涕 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 昌</p>
<p>冬令的肅淸運動</p>
<p>我國人有一個最不好的習慣，便是隨處吐痰和儷鼻涕，允其在公共塲所，我們可以見到牆脚壁根，往往痰涕淋漓，這是一個很鮮明的事　。</p>
<p>痰和涕，都是一種病的分泌物，別的不打緊，在一般開放性的肺病患者，那麼在一口痰液之中，正不知含有多少肺結核菌，如果隨處亂吐，那麼他所散播的傳染肺癆種子，使人防不勝防，在　形中作廣　性的間接殺人工作，其危險性實較有形的炸彈更加利害，更加可怖！</p>
<p>尤其在冬令，因爲氣溫低降空氣乾燥，痰涕一經着地，也瞬卽乾燥，隨塵埃而飛揚，其中含有結核菌的，藉空氣爲侵襲的途徑，他的侵人人體，恐怕現代戰爭中風頭最健，閃電戰術，還沒有他那樣神速，這在公衆健康上，是怎樣一個嚴重的威脅，簡直不能想像，也無法可以形容。</p>
<p>所以一到冬季，我們以十二分的眞誠，要請多痰多涕的朋友，出門常携大手帕一二方，以備有痰吐在手帕之用，有涕　打嚏時也可把手帕掩着鼻子，不但是一種公德，而且藉此在冬令可以實行肅淸痰涕運動，在公衆健康上，也是一件功德　量的　呀！</p>
<p>進補經騐：二三年來，新出補藥，風起雲湧，以筆者經騐所得，在「質」「量」「效」三面確　高人一等的，惟「壽爾康」一種足以當之無愧；余自服該藥以來，身體日益頑健，終日精神振作愉快，過去種種衰老現象，今已一掃而盡，諺云「經騐往往會超過學識一，筆者爰據身歷經騐不避嫌疑，權作一識涂老　，爲文介紹，以爲吾進補諸君告。（華）</p>
<p>爲服魚肝油精者進一言：赫立維他比目角肝油精Halivita，（分膠囊滴劑兩種），其維他命食量，强於魚肝油一百倍，此乃美國魚肝油類出品專家，漢　斯製藥公司所精製，（Health　Prodncts　Corp．，　Newark，N．J．U．S．A．）孩廠規模宏大，在美國亦屬罕見，其生物化騐室，此諸美國仟何醫科大學或醫院所有者為大，魚肝油倉庫常存七萬七千噸之多，關於煉製技術方面，除僱用第一流藥師及技師外，尚聘有政府醫藥專家，及各醫科大學敎授，為常川顧問，並畜賽小鼠二千餘頭，和鷄禽一千五百　　，以作生　實騐之用，其煉製過程　歷二年以上方始出售於巿，可知其出品之精良，成份之準確，赫立維他經美國政府核騐證實，每公分　含維他命甲六萬美國單位，維他命　一千　國單位，而濟劑之維他命　含量，較膠囊史爲豐富，每公分計含維他命甲六萬美國單位，維他命丁六千美國單位，對於孩童孕婦乳婦尤為適宜。</p>

<h3 id="e1">President Roosevelt Announces US Loan of $100 Million to China, Half of Which Will Be Used to Protect Chinese Currency; A Forceful Reply to Japan's Recognition of the Wang Regime <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>WASHINGTON - President Roosevelt officially announced yesterday evening that the United States has extended a credit of $50 million to China. The President also stated that the government is considering continuing loans to China to reach a total of $100 million. This announcement was made immediately after indirectly receiving news that the Japanese-Wang "Agreement" had been signed in Nanjing. President Roosevelt stated in his official announcement regarding the loan, "Economic cooperation talks between the Chinese and American authorities have made progress. The US government is considering extending a credit loan of $100 million US dollars to China, of which $50 million US dollars for the purchase of ordinary goods has been decided by the US government." The President further stated, "The US government is currently seeking to ensure that the remaining $50 million loan can be completed as soon as possible. This other $50 million is to be used to protect Chinese legal tender, thereby maintaining the currency balance between China and the United States. This type of fund is currently being discussed by the Congressional Budget Committee." President Roosevelt issued a formal statement saying the government is working to get another $50 million in loans implemented soon to stabilize Chinese legal tender. This loan brings the total amount the United States has loaned to China since 1932, including loans already made and those to be made, to $245 million US dollars. In the past two years, the United States has only loaned China $16 million. Before the new loan announced yesterday, the United States had loaned China a total of $85 million, of which China has repaid $9 million. Yesterday's loan, together with subsequent loans, totals $160 million US dollars.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt reported that US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau will attend a joint meeting of the Senate Banking Committee and the House Committee on Weights and Measures on Monday to report on the currently proposed $50 million expansion of credit loans. Diplomatic and international circles believe that the loan at this time is of great significance. Many believe that the United States is trying to offset any serious impact from Japan's recognition of the Wang Jingwei regime. Observers recall that the United States has taken several steps to benefit Chongqing whenever Japan has taken actions that harm the Chongqing Chinese National Government. When Hankou fell, the United States provided China with a large amount of loans for the first time. When the Burma Road was blocked, the United States imposed an embargo on Japan on several essential materials. Recently, when Japan was about to join the Axis powers, the United States announced that it would give China a new loan. Now that China is encountering a favorable situation, the United States is once again providing this assistance. China's favorable factors include (1) the strengthening of the US military power in the Pacific, (2) the defense talks between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Australia regarding Singapore and other Pacific regions, and (3) the strengthening of the British naval position in the Mediterranean. British Prime Minister Churchill said that this move is sufficient to affect Britain's power in other remote parts of the world. It is reported that this new loan between China and the United States was negotiated by the Chinese Ambassador to Washington, Hu Shi, and Song Ziwen. Song Ziwen is the Chairman of the Bank of China and the former Minister of Finance of China. It is also reported that the majority of this new aid, of which $60 million US dollars is said to be not in the nature of a loan, but a kind of trade arrangement for goods shipped from China to the United States at market price. This shows that the United States is willing to maintain commercial contact with China and can rely on China's main raw materials to enhance the defense position of the United States. (United Press International)</p>
<p>The White House simultaneously released a letter from Jesse Jones, Administrator of the Federal Loan Agency, to President Roosevelt, regarding the purchase of military raw materials from China, stating, "Regarding the purchase of military raw materials that are extremely important in the US national defense program, the Metals Reserve Company, an affiliate of the Federal Loan Administration, is now continuing to order tungsten, antimony, tin, and other materials worth $60 million from the Chinese Resources Committee. The goods will be delivered at market prices suitable for loan repayments in the coming years. In order to assist China in dealing with its current financial problems, the United States Export-Import Bank has agreed to lend another $50 million to the Chinese government, guaranteed by the Central Bank of China, and the above-mentioned order of metals will be used to offset the loan." This letter stated that the US Treasury Department had granted the same loan, so that China would be provided with a new loan of $100 million. It then stated that China had paid the United States on schedule with tung oil and tin, fulfilling its obligation to sell these necessities to the United States to pay off previous debts, which the President was pleased to hear. (Reuters)</p>
<p>NEW YORK - The New York Times reported today that the United States' loan to China is President Roosevelt's first important diplomatic action after being elected for his third term. This move by the United States not only hopes to consolidate China's strength to resist Japan, but also encourages the Soviet Union to continue to aid China. (Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chongqing Welcomes US Loan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>CHONGQING - Official circles here heard the news of the US loan of $50 million to China and were very welcoming, saying that this move by the United States is sufficient to counter the economic and military treaty signed yesterday in Nanjing. Officials said that this new loan is the United States' political and moral support for China's war of resistance and should not be regarded as a relief for China's urgent needs, because the second loan from the United States has not yet been fully used, and the third loan has not been used at all. (United Press International)</p>
<p>Hull Declares Policy Unchanged, Continues to Recognize Chongqing Government</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hull commented on the Japanese-Wang treaty at a press conference yesterday, saying that the United States will of course continue to recognize the Chongqing government. He said, "On March 30, I made a broad statement of basic principles, which can be applied to any stage of the Sino-Japanese incident. I think it is best for you to review it." Hull's previous remarks were made when the Wang regime was established. They stated, "This is another step in the process of a country imposing itself on its neighbors by force and obstructing its normal political and economic relations with other countries in the world. Japan hopes to establish a system in which Japan has a unique advantage and deprives the United States and other third countries of the right to equal and fair treatment that they have long enjoyed. The circumstances of the establishment of the Wang regime are not consistent with Japan's claim that it will respect China's political independence. The Chongqing government has the support and approval of the majority of the Chinese people. The US policy remains unchanged."</p>
<p>In general, people here say that Wang Jingwei's telegram to Chongqing is just a formality and is not worth answering. The Japanese-Wang treaty signed yesterday, as transmitted by Chinese news agencies, clearly states that Japan has no intention of withdrawing Japanese troops from China at any time. Because neither Wang Jingwei nor the Japanese can defeat the Chongqing government, the so-called withdrawal of troops two years after the complete restoration of peace in all parts of China is a distant prospect, far beyond reasonable expectations. People here also say that Japan is now actively trying to shake hands with Moscow, the center of the Communist Party. If the plan succeeds, Japan will also shake hands with the communist army in China, which Japan calls its interests and ideas are the same as those of Moscow's communism. In that case, why does Japan want an anti-communist zone to station troops in North China? (Reuters)</p>

<p>WASHINGTON - Acting Secretary of the Navy Kenden declared in the Navy's annual report yesterday that President Roosevelt believes that the US policy is to arm itself rapidly to meet the needs of national defense on both oceans. Kenden quoted the President as saying, "The United States should complete its naval defense needs as quickly as possible so that it can resist any joint attack on both oceans." The report stated that the United States should have enough troops to be able to take action freely in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, while at the same time ensuring the safety of defense in another ocean. The report expressed satisfaction with the current US warships and their progress, believing that the fleet still has room for improvement. The report said that there has been a serious shortage of naval personnel recently, but this shortage has been greatly reduced due to the employment of veterans and reservists. As of June 30 this year, the United States' combat power included 15 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 18 heavy cruisers, 19 light cruisers, 197 destroyers, 44 old destroyers not in service, 101 submarines, as well as countless auxiliary ships and minesweepers. There are 10 battleships, 5 aircraft carriers, 17 light cruisers, 61 destroyers, and several shallow-water ships under construction. (United Press International)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Foreign Minister Wang Issues Solemn Statement Regarding Nanjing Treaty Signing <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>CHONGQING - The reaction here to the signing of the treaty between Wang and Japan in Nanjing yesterday was to warn other countries that recognizing this organization would be considered an unfriendly act. This warning appeared in a statement issued by Foreign Minister Wang last night. The full text is as follows: "The signing of the so-called treaty between Japan and the Nanjing puppet organization is a further stage in Japan's aggression, aimed at destroying all laws and order in China and the entire Pacific. Japan has already created a puppet organization to achieve its desires, and now it is signing a treaty with it to help its policy of hegemony and aggression. In fact, this organization is nothing more than a department of the Tokyo government, placed on Chinese territory, and is a tool for Japan to implement its policies. The National Government of the Republic of China has repeatedly declared its attitude, and now solemnly declares again that the Nanjing puppet regime is an illegal organization, and its actions, regardless of their nature, are completely invalid for the entire Chinese people and any foreign country. The treaty it signed is also illegal and has no binding force. If any foreign country recognizes this puppet organization, the Chinese government and people will regard it as the most unfriendly action and will have to sever normal relations with that country. China is determined to fight until the final victory. China is confident that it will definitely win, and that freedom, law, and justice will surely defeat everything." (Reuters)</p>
<p>TOKYO - A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry declared yesterday that the agreement signed between Japan and Wang Jingwei and "Manchukuo" is not a peace treaty. This "agreement" only stipulates Sino-Japanese relations in principle. China's peace depends on Chongqing's cessation of resistance. Therefore, the issue of the immediate withdrawal of Japanese troops from China cannot be considered at present. (Haitong Telegraph)</p>

<h3 id="e7">New Phase of the Far East Crisis <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, those concerned about the fate of the Far East have been watching the possible developments with a tense mood. It is as if everything directed in the shadows will have a surprising posture and influence on the separation period. But until the dark curtain is opened, what is presented to the eyes is nothing but familiar clichés. Looking at the form, it is impossible to understand what the people in it have in mind and how they can explain themselves.</p>
<p>The issue between China and Japan has its internal causes and its inevitable trend. Due to the natural and man-made conditions, China's independence and liberation and Japan's continental policy happen to be directly opposed to each other and cannot coexist. That is, the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese war became inevitable in Japan's continental policy. This is a historical tragedy and a historical necessity. Indeed, unless the attempts of aggression and enslavement disappear in the Far East, there can be no peace between them. Therefore, in the process where the Sino-Japanese war has long existed, even if there are various kinds of interludes to embellish it, the result cannot shake the mainstream of the war, nor can it change the essence of the relationship between the two countries. It is inevitable that it will be labor and no function and become a laughing stock.</p>
<p>However, in this general inevitability, there are also strange contradictions. According to the statement of the Japanese Foreign Ministry the day before yesterday, the "agreement" signed by it is not a "peace condition", but only stipulates the "Chinese" and Japanese relations in principle. Then, the Japanese side's evaluation of this agreement is obviously not too high, and even in the agreement itself, it affirms the necessity of continuing the war. Then, why is it that the Imperial Decision, the Privy Council review, and the respect of the former cabinet premier are involved in traveling back and forth across the ocean to promote this document that does not change the reality? Is this to help the war of aggression against China, or to help Japan's current difficulties? In terms of peace, it is still in an unknowable future, and in terms of practical effect, it cannot exceed the area controlled by the Japanese army. In addition to the Twenty-One Demands, it only leaves a deeper and greater stain on Japan's diplomatic history, and it is also felt that the Japanese authorities have not become smarter due to countless experiences and lessons. As for the great difference between what it shows in reality and what has been seen in the past, there is no need to point it out in detail.</p>
<p>When the Japanese side's peace offensive once sprouted not long ago, although the general public fundamentally questioned the original intention of the Japanese side, they did not expect it to be able to be more accurate and out of awareness and repentance. The Japanese side's situation has now reached the end of its road. There is only a difference in thought between destruction and transcendence. If it has a healthy rationality and common sense, it will be able to be aware of this kind of gambling on the national fortune, which is similar to madness. When the Matsuoka plan was exposed, the unpleasant scene in Moling was already being directed at the same time. In less than 20 days before and after, the steps from the convening of the Imperial Conference and the Privy Council to Abe's arrival in China again with his secret strategy were closely followed, without hesitation to indicate that he was still expecting the effect of the peace offensive. This is enough to prove that everything Matsuoka said is only like smoke, not from the heart, and everything that is currently realized is where the Japanese side's original intention lies. This kind of dazed and flustered peace offensive and the diplomatic offensive that complements it should now be permanently cut off, and can no longer be used to confuse the internal and external vision, and there is no longer the possibility of cooperating with military actions to seek success.</p>
<p>The words of the Four Parts and Nineteen Articles, although they cannot have new meanings and functions in fact, confirm the truth of another similar proclamation ten months ago. At the same time, it can be seen that Japan's attempt to destroy China has been consistent before and after, and has never changed due to time and environment. The serious nature hidden under the implicit and flexible terms cannot be concealed by the existence of a few other grand terms. This fact will not only cast a heavy shadow on the psychology of the Chinese people regarding the Far East issue, confirming that the success of the war of resistance is the only way out, but also stimulate international listening and cause serious repercussions. Within one day yesterday, in addition to the formal statements of the British and American governments, the United States also announced the establishment of a huge loan of 100 million US dollars to China. The nature of this loan has obviously progressed from commercial loans to the scope of political loans, which is undoubtedly caused by Japan's new actions against China. Japan may have been prepared to bet on one thing and no longer care about all this, but if it is for its own actual interests, I am afraid it will not feel at ease! On the other hand, it is fussy about the so-called anti-communist and garrison troops in Mongolia, which shows that its Soviet policy has not made any progress so far, so it cannot relax its anti-Soviet deployment. However, although Japan today is struggling, its recent deployments have proved that its southward movement is already on the string. If it is said that its active direction of the recent scene against China also has its active intention, that is to establish the "legal" status and specific measures for its rule and exploitation of the occupied areas of China, so as to use China's economic potential to transfer military power in China and launch new adventures in other directions. Look at its special emphasis on economic resources, financial enterprises, trade and transportation, and it is not tired of detailed definition. It can be seen where its great desire lies, and the guarantee of this plunder can naturally only be achieved under Japan's consolidation of its control.</p>
<p>Recent events have shown that Japan's new adventure has actually begun. Although the actual damage it can cause to China cannot exceed the scope of its military activities and the extent that has already been achieved, it has issued a common and well-known warning to the Far East, and even to the whole world.</p>

<p>Bangkok: Thai Prime Minister Major General Phibunsongkhram recently declared in a public statement that Thai aircraft are prepared for a large-scale bombing of Eastern Cambodia and Laos in Vietnam. The Thai army is also prepared to attack Vietnam because the French troops in Thakhek still use machine guns and rifles to shoot at Thai civilians on the banks of the Mekong River. This declaration by the Thai Prime Minister is sufficient to indicate that the border war between Thailand and Vietnam has already begun. Furthermore, the Thai military high command has reaffirmed the news of Thailand's victory on Friday, which was published in large-character headlines throughout Bangkok. (United Press International dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Official sources stated that Thai bombers once again raided Thakhek on Friday, flying very low. Two people were killed and two were injured.

<p>Bucharest: Yesterday evening, the Romanian army issued a general mobilization order. War has broken out between the Romanian army loyal to Propescu and the Iron Guard, which may turn into a civil war. Last night, everyone expected that fighting would continue after the state funeral of the late Iron Guard leader Codreanu. It is believed that many people were killed in the battle of Propescu. It is reported that the fighting is still continuing this morning. Similar battles have also occurred elsewhere, and it is reported that the Iron Guard, disregarding the army, has occupied several public buildings. The Iron Guard's actions have been suppressed for many years by previous political leaders, so this time they are eager for revenge. General Antonescu, the Prime Minister, has declared general mobilization and martial law nationwide as a last resort. Although Antonescu's measures are very rapid, general opinion still recognizes that they came too late. Prince Sturdza, the Romanian Foreign Minister, has returned to Bucharest from Berlin. It is rumored that Sturdza brought new instructions from the Nazi leader, stating that the Iron Guard must be brought under control immediately. So far, Deputy Prime Minister Sima, an influential leader of the Iron Guard, has appealed to the Iron Guard to stop assassinations, but to no effect.

Although normalcy has been restored here today, the general situation remains extremely tense.

<p>Lyon: The Times recently commented on the Romanian political situation, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the arrogance of the Iron Guard. The article stated, "In a totalitarian state, where all power is concentrated in the hands of the head of state, it is intolerable if certain unrestrained forces persist in their own way, doing whatever they want, leading to fierce opposition from the people and even undermining the responsible government's work of reconstruction. Therefore, if the country wants to avoid the catastrophe of civil war, it is time to maintain the necessary authority of the state." (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Budapest: It is rumored that elite German troops began guarding the new Romanian King Michael yesterday to prevent any disturbances by the Iron Guard.

<p>Bucharest: The funeral of the late Romanian Iron Guard leader Captain Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and thirteen of his followers was held yesterday. They were buried with other Iron Guard martyrs outside the city. The funeral procession was five miles long, starting from the Greek Orthodox Cathedral in the city center and ending at the cemetery. There were 10,000 spectators along the way. All business in Bucharest was suspended. The cathedral was filled with members of the Iron Guard. Priests held the most solemn Mass.

<p>Bucharest: The funeral of Corneliu Zelea Codreanu, leader of the Iron Guard, and thirteen members who were killed two years ago was held in Bucharest. German and Romanian troops, armed with bayonets, were on guard everywhere to prevent new incidents from erupting after the funeral. While German and Romanian troops were on guard in Bucharest, fierce street fighting broke out again in several cities in the provinces of Romania last night. A major conflict in Bucharest can be prevented because heavy troops are stationed there, but Antonescu's dictatorial new regime is already shaky, so it is expected that other disturbances will occur soon. Young King Michael is still living in the palace, under close protection to prevent assassination. The young king is nominally "under protection" in the palace, but in reality, he is under house arrest. He has been in this situation for four days. Michael's mother recently left Romania. It is rumored that Michael tried to leave the country with his mother, but failed. Foreign news says that the young king has actually escaped, but this has not been confirmed in Bucharest today. It is also learned that Germany no longer trusts Antonescu. The reason for this is that it is rumored that Michael may personally take over the dictatorship. When Codreanu was buried, 100,000 members of the Iron Guard held the ropes to show their grief. (International News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>Vichy: It was rumored that the new French High Commissioner to Syria, Chiappe, had died on the 28th of this month. This was recently confirmed by an official public announcement. Chiappe boarded a plane at a certain French airfield on the morning of the 27th to go to Beirut, the capital of Syria, to take office. He planned to land in Tunis, North Africa, but while flying over the sky between Sardinia and North Africa in the Mediterranean Sea, he was suddenly attacked by military aircraft with machine guns. It has not yet been determined whether this aircraft was British or Italian. The circumstances at the time are also unclear, but according to reliable sources, it is only known that the plane Chiappe was on had flown over two aircraft carriers at the time. It is not known what happened to those on the same plane as Chiappe. Chiappe served as the Director-General of the Paris Police from 1928 until February 1934, when he was dismissed by Prime Minister Daladier due to riots in Paris.

<p>London – Several German bombers, attempting to attack the crippled HMS Javelin destroyer in the English Channel, were shot down by the Royal Air Force. The first engagement occurred off Cornwall at 11:00 AM. A Spitfire fighter escorting the destroyer spotted a suspicious aircraft. Upon identifying it as a Dornier Do 17 bomber, the Spitfire turned to engage, maneuvering through cloud layers between 2,500 and 6,500 feet, firing upon it. The enemy aircraft was riddled with bullets and crashed into the sea. Of the five crew members, one jumped out and died in the water. Shortly after, a Junkers Ju 88 bomber approached the HMS Javelin and was intercepted by another Spitfire, also crashing into the sea. In the afternoon, a Dornier Do 17 bomber arrived and was shot down by British aircraft. Finally, a Junkers Ju 88 attempted a fourth attack, but was met by two Spitfires. The enemy aircraft retreated into the clouds, making it impossible to determine if it sustained damage. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

Long-range artillery also continued to shell Dover on the 29th. On the night of the 20th, British aircraft hit several civilian houses and a small factory. (DNB, 1st)</p>
<p>London – Following the daylight raid on London by 200 German aircraft yesterday, the Luftwaffe heavily attacked the south coast and Wales last night and this morning. Today, the Air Ministry announced that an unnamed city on the south coast was subjected to intense bombing. (This city is believed to be Southampton.) The Luftwaffe appears to be executing a methodical and organized plan to turn the cities around London into scorched earth, isolating the capital, so that the German invasion force can advance unhindered. Yesterday's daylight raid on London was a swift retaliation for the RAF's heavy bombing of Cologne, Bremen, and Berlin. It is believed that Italian aircraft participated in the bombing of London. Meanwhile, the Admiralty today confirmed that the destroyer HMS Javelin has been lost. (International, 1st)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to DNB, German aircraft heavily bombed London on the night of the 28th, causing fires to break out everywhere. A major fire erupted in the Finsbury district. German aircraft also attacked Liverpool, Birmingham, and the docks and stations of Ipswich. (DNB, 1st)</p>

<p>Berlin – After a day of "powerful strikes" on London by the Luftwaffe, Southampton was attacked last night using "Coventry"-style tactics. This major British port of Southampton is well-known to countless world travelers. It is believed that this bombing of the city was the largest in scale to date. At 7:30 PM yesterday, German light and heavy bombers dropped countless bombs of various calibers, causing eight major fires. German aircraft employed night attack tactics, initially dropping incendiary bombs to guide German aircraft carrying high-explosive bombs. Nazi pilots patrolling British airspace reported after inspecting the damage caused by previous raids on Britain that the major fire in Manchester three days ago was still burning last night. (International, 1st)</p>
<p>London – After wreaking havoc on London Friday night and Saturday morning, German aircraft launched another attack last night. But after midnight and into this morning, the German offensive eased, and London reports calm today. The German raiders apparently attempted to destroy all transport links by densely dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs on London. The heavy destruction and carnage last night were concentrated in the nearest districts surrounding the capital. More flares were dropped than previously. Many people were caught in large buildings that were nearly completely destroyed by direct hits. While in previous weeks, Sundays have often been days of respite from air raids, heavy fog in the English Channel and northern France may also have contributed to the reduction in German activity. The eleventh air raid in three days consisted of a heavy bombing of a southwestern town for several hours, with intense anti-aircraft fire finally driving away the German aircraft. The town was also attacked three times during the day yesterday. At 5:50 PM on Saturday afternoon, three bombs landed in a London district, marking the beginning of the night raid. The bombs destroyed several houses but caused no deaths or injuries. Air raids were also reported in a town in East Anglia and western England. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>

<p>Greek Forces’ Lure Works</p>
<p>Washington – American military experts here revealed that, prior to the outbreak of the Greco-Italian war, the Greeks had deliberately feigned timidity to lure the Italian forces, encouraging their arrogance and making them believe that the Greek forces were no match for them. The powerful Italian forces believed they could march straight into Greece upon arrival, with the Greek forces surrendering without a fight, as the Greeks viewed their opposition to the Italian forces as akin to throwing eggs against rocks. Experts here also said that the Greeks used their "sixth column" to cleverly defeat the Italian "fifth column". The Italian forces are now trapped in the mountains of Albania because of the Greek ploy to lure the enemy before the war. Citing reliable overseas information, American military experts stated that the Greeks believe the most effective way to deal with modern Trojan Horse tactics is through counter-espionage. The fifth column was deceived into encouraging Mussolini to launch an attack on Greece. (International, 1st)</p>

<p>Why did the German army, after defeating France, waste two months of precious time, failing to take advantage of the victory to invade the British Isles directly? Military experts from various countries are still studying this question. This article is an observation by Demaree Bess, the European correspondent for the American "Saturday Evening Post." He remained in Paris before and after the German army entered, and had a clear view of the situation behind the German lines. The following is a translation of his wireless report to the newspaper:</p>
<p>From mid-June to mid-August of this year, for two months, the German army's campaign to invade England virtually stalled. In terms of weather, these two months were the most suitable period for bomber operations, and in this life-or-death struggle, the outcome might have been decided. However, the German army let time slip away and did not take the opportunity to carry out a blitzkrieg against England. Why?</p>
<p>Military strategists have offered many tactical explanations for the German army's temporary inactivity, but according to those who have witnessed the evolution of everything in France under German occupation, these tactical explanations are still insufficient. The German High Command was willing to sacrifice these precious eight weeks, actually for two major reasons. First, they misjudged England. Second, Germany is employing a method of "circus training wild animals" on the European continent. Anyone with experience knows that capturing wild animals is not very difficult, but taming them and making them available for human use is not an easy task!</p>
<p>In mid-June, shortly after France requested an armistice, a German newsreel showed Hitler receiving the French request on the front lines. Surrounded by officers, the dictator walked with light, dancing steps, and exclaimed with elation, "The situation is settled!"</p>
<p>What was the meaning of this inner thought from Hitler's mouth, we may never know. He boasted that he had the foresight to observe history a thousand years later, so he wouldn't have said that his empire had been created and completed from now on! Moreover, he loved to read the history of ancient empires and must have known that the great task of building an empire is an endless undertaking.</p>
<p>But it is somewhat close to saying that Hitler believed that the collapse of France meant the end of the Western Front, at least that was the feeling of the German soldiers in the occupied area of France. They had planned to hold a grand victory parade on July 14, the French Democratic Memorial Day, and Paris became the center of preparations at that time.</p>
<p>The citizens of Paris all heard the news of the parade. The first order of the occupying army was to remove sandbag barricades along the parade route and restore the fountains along the streets to enhance the spectacle. Military bands practiced performing, and aircraft practiced formations in the Paris sky. All hotels were requisitioned, and hotel managers were told that as many as 50,000 Germans would come to France for sightseeing.</p>
<p>The small hotel where we were staying was also occupied by a German team at this time, and the commander was quite polite and allowed us to stay in it temporarily.</p>
<p>His adjutant, who spoke English fluently, said that Miss Morgan and the staff of her relief organization had to move out. He asked my wife to inspect the room before they moved in.</p>
<p>He said, "We want you to check the items in the room, and we hope you will not hesitate to check again when we leave, and tell Miss Morgan that nothing is missing."</p>
<p>We asked him, "How long will it take you to leave?"</p>
<p>He told us, "It won't be long, the war is almost over."</p>
<p>But on French Democratic Memorial Day, there was no victory parade, and nothing happened in the weeks that followed. Military bands and performing aircraft were rarely seen, and news of Germans coming to France for sightseeing was no longer mentioned. Many of the requisitioned hotels have been returned. The number of German troops in Paris has also gradually decreased.</p>
<p>What exactly happened? It is said that Germany had proposed peace terms to England, but they were rejected by England shortly after. Regarding the German proposal, a German staff officer later told us roughly. He said that Germany must have absolute control over the European continent, and England should no longer interfere in European affairs. As for outside of Europe, Germany asked for the return of the former German colonies in Africa and a narrow strip across central Africa, and nothing else.</p>
<p>In the minds of Germans, these conditions were obviously very generous and reasonable, and they could not help but be surprised that England rejected them. This was the second time they had been wrong about the British. They can often estimate others very accurately, but the British always make them unpredictable. In 1914, they did not expect Britain to participate in the war. When they invaded Poland in 1939, they did not expect Britain to declare war on Germany. This summer, when they proposed peace, they did not expect Britain to ignore them at all.</p>
<p>A month after France surrendered, Germany finally realized that Britain was determined to continue fighting. At this time, they had to deal with two difficulties at the same time: on the one hand, they had to continue to attack the British Isles, and on the other hand, they had to consolidate the occupied territories on the European continent. If there is any negligence, all efforts will be in vain.</p>
<p>It is not an exaggeration to say that the German army had to deal with more than a dozen battles at the same time. In every occupied country—especially France—the Germans encountered complex internal strife, which was actually brewing into civil unrest, only not yet manifested. The Germans knew very well that they should not only prevent private fighting from becoming open strife, but also ensure that pro-German factions were in the upper hand everywhere. This was a difficult task, so the Germans had to exhaust their efforts in the precious months of June, July, and August to consolidate the rear.</p>
<p>The internal strife in France and other places was not caused by the German invasion, they only intensified the civil unrest. All kinds of conflicts between classes and classes, groups and groups, and individuals and individuals have been brewing for a long time. France suffered a tragic disaster because it could not eliminate the dispute within the wall in the face of a great enemy, which led to the irretrievable situation. The chaos of the French army and government was largely caused by this. Of course, during the war, this kind of civil unrest could help the German army a lot, but after France surrendered, it became a hidden danger for Germany and could not be ignored.</p>
<p>Since June, due to strict inspections and traffic congestion, there have been few rumors about the internal strife in France. Even most French people do not know its important developments. Only by comparing and pondering information from all parties and talking to key figures in the situation can they get a general idea.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the internal strife in France are not clear. Some people think that this is a struggle between conservatives and progressives, a struggle between democracy and totalitarianism, a struggle between communism and fascism, a struggle between the fifth column and patriotic patriots. The core of the dispute is not the question of whether to love the country or not, but the question of opinion. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Chinese Constables Resumed Work Yesterday; Demands to Be Made Today; Bureau to Convene Board Meeting to Discuss, Sympathy Expressed in Principle <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, more than a thousand Chinese constables from the Central and Old Zhabei police stations of the Public Concession went on strike due to dissatisfaction with the Bureau's method of increasing housing allowance subsidies and demanding improved treatment. The security of the central district was temporarily left unattended, and the situation was very tense. When Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing heard the news and rushed to the scene, he earnestly persuaded them with Yao Huimo, the Chinese Deputy Director of the Police Department, and guaranteed a satisfactory solution. The disturbance came to an end, and they all returned to their posts at noon, and order was restored. It is reported that regarding this incident, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, the Commissioner of Police, Mr. Bowen, and Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing had a meeting at the Municipal Council on the afternoon of the previous day. The Bureau expressed that it agreed in principle with the demands of the Chinese constables, but wished that both parties would discuss the matter frankly and sincerely. Before a solution could be reached, they hoped that the Chinese constables would understand the difficult times, be at ease in their duties, and avoid unexpected problems.</p>
<p>Chinese Constables Committee Begins Work</p>
<p>In addition to the patrol constables of the Central and Old Zhabei police stations on the previous day, although the patrol constables of other police stations did not go on strike, they had reached a consensus on the opinion of improving treatment. Currently, the Chinese constables of the eight police stations in the Public Concession have elected sixteen representatives to organize the "Chinese Constables Committee" to carry out all matters. It has been recognized by Mr. Yu Qiaqing and the police authorities, and it was working inside the Central Police Station on Fuzhou Road yesterday. All expenses are provided by the authorities. At 3:00 p.m. yesterday, representatives of the Chinese constables from various police stations gathered there to hold a meeting to discuss the content of the conditions for improving treatment to be submitted to the Municipal Council. It was decided to send the following document to the authorities:</p>
<p>Sincere Document Requesting Improved Treatment</p>
<p>Submitted to earnestly request an increase in salary and allowances. Due to the soaring prices of various goods at present, the original salaries of the constables are very difficult to maintain the current living standards. Forced by circumstances, we hereby request that the original salaries be appropriately increased to compensate for the deficit and avoid starvation. It is a matter of virtue and convenience. The requested items are listed as follows: (Clauses omitted). Respectfully submitted by the Chinese Constables Representatives Committee, December 2, 1940.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Planning and Discussion to Resolve</p>
<p>After formulating the above conditions, all the Chinese constable representatives have decided to send a representative with this document to Yao Huimo, the Chief Inspector of Chinese Constables of the Police Department, at 2:00 p.m. today, and then the Police Department will forward it to the highest authorities for approval. The Chinese constables also request a response no later than the morning of the 5th. It is reported that the Municipal Council has decided to convene a board meeting on the 3rd or 4th to discuss solutions because this matter involves financial revenue and expenditure and requires comprehensive planning.</p>
<p>Maintaining Law and Order is a Heavy Responsibility</p>
<p>The reporter from Da Zhong News Agency met with Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing last night to inquire about the development of this matter. According to him, it is gratifying that the Chinese constables, after being persuaded by him, have taken the overall situation into consideration and will soon resume their loyal duties. He believes that patrol constables are not comparable to factory workers. They are public officials and bear the heavy responsibility of maintaining law and order. Therefore, requesting improved treatment is one thing, and serving is another. They must not abandon their duties in order to achieve the goal of improving treatment, and disregard law and order. Fortunately, they all understand the importance of the situation and have returned to their posts to await a solution. The origin of this disturbance lies in the fact that after adding a twelve yuan housing allowance subsidy, the Bureau reduced the rice subsidy by two yuan, which led to a misunderstanding. Now the Bureau has understood the situation and can give careful consideration to the demands of the Chinese constables. On the part of the Chinese constables, they should also make reasonable and acceptable demands. Changing the demand to improve treatment means that conditions involving political nature do not need to be raised. It is not true that the Municipal Council Board of Directors will hold an emergency meeting today. It is necessary to wait for the Chinese constables to submit their demands before considering and discussing them. As far as he knows, the Municipal Council has not convened a meeting in one or two days.</p>
<p>Silk Industry Association, etc. Solicit</p>
<p>Winter Relief Shelter Expenses</p>
<p>In order to accommodate the poverty-stricken people suffering from hunger and cold, the Disaster Relief Association has specially built a simple shed in Yan's residence to set up a winter relief shelter. Personnel have already been sent to survey the location, which requires 120,000 yuan. The Silk Industry Association and leaders from all walks of life have solicited donations.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Unstable Rice Prices Lead to Social Unrest; Rice Market Must Be Rectified; Yu Qiaqing Discusses Methods to Suppress Rice Prices; Citizens Should Quickly Participate in Group Rice Purchases <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Since the illegal surge in the city's rice market, rumors have been endless. The people's food and social security have been severely affected. Recently, the Chinese constables in the central district also demanded improved treatment due to the difficulty of maintaining their livelihoods. Although it was very brief, it has caused panic and unrest in all circles. The cold winter has arrived, and it is the time when bandits and thieves are rampant.</p>
<p>Three Key Points for Reforming the Market</p>
<p>According to a gentleman who is familiar with the rice market, there are the following points that need to be reformed in the current rice market: (1) Strictly limit entry to the market. Unless they are sellers, merchants, or rice dealers who purchase rice, others should be strictly prohibited. (2) The method of setting a time limit for delivery, although repeatedly discussed and announced by the rice industry groups, has become a dead letter to this day. Most of the transactions in the market are selling short and buying short, which gives speculators an opportunity. (3) Shorten the trading time to reduce the effect of speculators spreading rumors in the market and avoid the sudden rise in market prices. It is especially important to ban afternoon trading at present. If certain people's usual tricks in the morning fail to sell, they will continue to implement them in the afternoon until they achieve their goals. Therefore, stopping afternoon trading is also a way to prevent rumors.</p>
<p>Should Quickly Continue to Hold Price Controls</p>
<p>Handling broken rice at controlled prices can passively relieve the poor who cannot afford to buy expensive rice, and it is even more significant in the active aspect. If the poor can buy rice at controlled prices, they can reduce the actual sales of rice and grain every day, so that speculators have fewer opportunities to raise prices. This can be observed from the situation after previous price controls. Every time after price controls are implemented, the price of rice in the market will fall. After the suspension of price controls, the price rises again. The situation of continuous price increases after the end of the seventh period of this year is the most obvious. It is reported that the Shanghai Price Control Association will postpone the opening of the eighth period, which will last for about one month, until December of the lunar calendar due to funding issues. This is not only something that the civilians of this city cannot wait for, but it also has a great impact on the entire rice market. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities can provide strong assistance as soon as possible so that the eighth phase of price controls can be opened as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Price Evaluation Meeting Postponed</p>
<p>In response to the frequent rise in rice prices, the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Industry Association convened an emergency meeting in the afternoon of the previous day, believing that the rise in rice prices was due to the spread of unfounded rumors in the market. In addition to announcing a strict crackdown on illegal transactions in the market, the rice and grain price evaluation committee meeting scheduled to be held in this city today will be postponed. The original text of its announcement to the market is as follows: "It has been found that the price of rice and grain is becoming more and more expensive today, and the people's livelihood and security are in a worrying state. The key to the problem, although complex, is also a major factor in the spread of rumors and people's nervousness. According to the investigation, the source of foreign rice is still unblocked, and the two production areas in Myanmar can still continue to place orders as much as possible. Various external rumors are unfounded and unbelievable. As for the purpose, it is still to increase the stock of grain, and we hope that colleagues will do their best to continue to order, and we hope that citizens will actively participate in group rice purchases, so that there will be preparations for emergencies and to maintain the people's food. In addition, colleagues must be warned that market transactions must strictly abide by the rules of buying and selling and must not overstep the boundaries. The Market Management Committee is now closely monitoring and strictly cracking down. No matter whether it is within or outside the industry, if there is any hoarding, manipulation, reselling, or raising prices for profit, once discovered, it will be immediately reported to the authorities for severe punishment. If there are large entrustments outside the industry, they should all be rejected, otherwise they will also be punished. This is a special announcement to the market, and it is hoped that everyone will abide by it. This is very important."</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Talks About Price Control Methods</p>
<p>Regarding the food problem, due to the unscrupulous elements in a few rice businesses, there is stirring up trouble and repeatedly raising market prices, resulting in a difficult situation for the people to seek food. Although the media has repeatedly criticized it and requested the authorities to quickly plan and remedy the situation, it has been of little effect. According to Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing's talk to the reporter of Da Zhong News Agency, he has given in-depth consideration to this serious food problem and has prepared the most effective method to suppress rice prices. He will formally send a letter to the Municipal Council within one or two days to negotiate and proceed, and intends to invite the banking industry and the rice industry to raise 15 million yuan to store 200,000 bags of foreign rice for sale at controlled prices.</p>
<h3 id="e49">The Entire Western Shanghai Extra-Settlement Area Is Almost Completely Blockaded; Except for Japanese, All Others Are Prohibited from Passing; The Tense Situation Is Unprecedented; Japanese Troops Search Everywhere with Handguns and Sabers <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>At 6:30 p.m. yesterday, Japanese military police and "municipal police" set up barbed wire fences at the intersections of Yu Yuan Road, Di Feng Road, Da Xi Road, and Yi Ding Pan Road in western Shanghai, cutting off traffic. Except for Japanese, people of any nationality were prohibited from passing.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Residents Suffer Misfortune Again</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Daily" newspaper said that the situation in the western Shanghai Extra-Settlement Area today (the 1st) is very bad for the unfortunate Chinese and foreign residents living within the area around Da Xi Road, Haig Road, Jessfield Road, and Zhaofeng Park. All traffic within the former British defense zone has now been stopped, and entry and exit are prohibited. Although some people have repeatedly requested accommodation, very few have been able to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>No Reason Given for Preventing Entry and Exit</p>
<p>Since the afternoon of yesterday (the 30th), after a Japanese military policeman was sniped on Da Xi Road, the obstacles set up there are now managed by the Japanese army and "municipal police." The Japanese troops carry handguns, sabers, and rifles. Some of the hired police also carry rifles with bayonets. They seem to have orders to continue to prevent the majority of people who want to leave but cannot, without explaining the reasons to them, cutting off all traffic in the area. Since yesterday afternoon, public buses have only been running to Jing'an Temple Station, and cars are not allowed to pass, except for those driven by Japanese government officials and some foreigners.</p>
<p>Roads Closed and Searches Continue</p>
<p>Yesterday's shooting incident caused the planned parade to be suspended. Yesterday morning, a group of fanatics holding paper flags and paste pots were busy pasting these unwelcome decorations on public buses, rickshaws, and other vehicles. Until the afternoon, after one of the three members of the Japanese military police patrol team was shot and wounded by a thug in Lane 52 of Da Xi Road, the situation in the area changed suddenly. In an instant, the streets were deserted due to the search. This search is still ongoing, and there are still no results as of today's deadline.</p>
<p>Wounded Japanese Soldier May Not Survive</p>
<p>At that time, the assassin knocked down the platoon leader of the conscripted military police and fled quickly. According to unofficial sources, the wounded Japanese military policeman may not survive. When the assassin and the Japanese military police exchanged fire, only a tailor standing next to him was injured. Since then, traffic in the alleys of Da Xi Road has been blocked. At the same time, the same steps were taken at Haig Road, Di Feng Road, Jessfield Road, Yi Ding Pan Road, and other key exits in the Extra-Settlement Area, as if to cut off the assassin's escape route.</p>
<p>Settlement Police Nowhere to Be Seen</p>
<p>The Extra-Settlement Area is in the area of ​​the Public Concession's Extra-Settlement Roads and is one of the most densely populated areas, also due to low rents. When foreign residents try to force their way into the area, unpleasant incidents often occur. People are forced to surrender with their spears and bayonets. Therefore, the Extra-Settlement Area has become a huge concentration camp for tens of thousands of worried and helpless residents. Last night, the patrol police of the Public Concession were nowhere to be seen in the area. Investigators and armed patrols from the Jing'an Temple Police Station were blocked in the Extra-Settlement Area by the Japanese army and reserve police. As for the ambulance dispatched by the Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade, it was not allowed to perform its duties.</p>

<p>Since the US President announced another loan of 100 million US dollars to China, the morale of the financial market in Shanghai has been greatly boosted. Yesterday was Sunday, and all financial markets such as securities, gold, and foreign exchange were closed as usual. Therefore, there must be a good performance after the market opens on Monday today. The reporter of Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the financial circles yesterday that half of the 100 million US dollars loaned to China by the United States is used to maintain Chinese currency and stabilize foreign exchange. China is determined to maintain the spirit of the past in its legal tender policy and will do its best to maintain it. Now that it has been blessed by the United States, its momentum is stronger. As for the Stabilization Fund Management Committee, its fund base is sufficient, and there is no problem in maintaining the fixed foreign exchange rate. The government will approve as much foreign exchange as possible for the import of essential necessities. The black market foreign exchange in Shanghai will also be stabilized. The rumors spread by speculators in the market before that China's foreign exchange fund had dried up have now been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>Foreigners' Restrictions Slightly Loosened</p>
<p>Today, a large number of curious Chinese people gathered at the corners bordering the Extra-Settlement Area, and were often rejected by the Japanese military police to open traffic, starving and freezing, and unable to return home. Until late at night, the restrictions began to loosen slightly. Foreigners with their own cars were allowed to pass. Other foreigners traveling by car on business had to get out of the car and walk home, and were repeatedly questioned and occasionally attempted to be searched along the way. As for the unfortunate Chinese people, they were searched one by one and blocked at the intersection concentration points. Most people were released until late at night.</p>

<p>Since the ambassadors of the four countries, Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union, gathered in Chongqing, their contacts with the Chinese government have been very frequent recently because assistance to China from countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is becoming more and more active. According to sources from the embassies of various countries in this city, British Ambassador Kerr originally planned to come to Shanghai at the end of this month to visit his wife and spend the Christmas holidays, but due to the current tense situation in the Far East, he temporarily intends to stay in the provisional capital to maintain close contact. US Ambassador Johnson is also planning to spend the year in Chongqing because US aid to China is becoming more and more active and many matters need to be planned and negotiated by the ambassador. As for French Ambassador Cosme, after returning to Chongqing from Chengdu, there has been no preparation to come to Shanghai. The affairs of the Shanghai Embassy are entrusted to the Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Marcie, for nearby agency. Also, Italian Ambassador Marquis, after returning to Shanghai from the south, is still residing in the Cathay Hotel on the Bund. Recently, in addition to frequent contacts with the overseas Chinese, he stays at home and rarely moves.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Shanghai-Nanjing Train Bombing Case: The Truth Gradually Emerges; Japanese Newspaper Reports Death of Chinese Platoon Leader; Conflicting Reports on Casualties <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>The bombing of the Shanghai-Nanjing train by Chinese mobile units has been a frequent occurrence, but none as severe as this recent incident. Japanese newspapers initially made no mention of it, but yesterday it appeared in the *Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun*. According to the report, "On the 29th of last month, at 8:50 AM, the Shanghai-bound No. 7 train, a third-class train, encountered a landmine explosion at 10:55 AM, five miles east of Suzhou station. The tracks were blown several dozen feet away, and the locomotive and four carriages overturned. Seventy-four passengers were killed (52 men, 5 boys, 12 women, 4 girls), 100 were seriously injured (70 men, 4 boys, 26 women), and 2 were slightly injured."</p>
<p>Wounded and Dead Piled Up, a Horrific Sight</p>
<p>In total, 176 people were killed or injured. Among the dead was one Japanese, Mr. Matsuda, 26 years old, an instructor on the locomotive. Two Japanese, railway guards, were injured. The scene was described as a living hell, a horrific sight. The Suzhou Japanese garrison received the alarm and immediately dispatched a joint force of Japanese military police, special service units, and military doctors to the scene. The dead were moved to a location about four or five miles north of the railway, and the wounded were taken to Suzhou Hospital for treatment. Meanwhile, a thorough search was conducted around the site, and the railway was repaired, reopening to traffic at 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>Three Landmines Detonated as the Train Arrived</p>
<p>After the incident, two people were found loitering in the railway security area.</p>
<p>Japanese security forces suspected them of being responsible for the bombing and opened fire, killing one on the spot and the other escaping without a trace.</p>
<p>A search of the dead man's body revealed him to be Meng Shaoguang, a lieutenant in the Chinese army, captain of the transportation team of the Loyalty and Patriotic Army General Headquarters of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Action Committee. He had departed from near Yixing on November 2nd, leading 17 team members, carrying 10 rifles, 220 rounds of ammunition, 10 handguns, 450 rounds of ammunition, 50 hand grenades, 191 wats of explosives, 6 detonators, 5 rolls of fuse, several storage batteries, and demolition tools, with the intention of infiltrating the area near Suzhou to sabotage the railway. On the 29th of last month, they finally carried out their plan. Meng led three men to bury three landmines the day before. When the No. 7 train was approaching, they ignited the fuse and fled. At that time, they were spotted by Japanese soldier Sukegawa, who gave chase. Meng fought back with two handguns, firing over twenty shots, but was eventually shot and killed.</p>
<p>Another Account of the Casualties</p>
<p>According to a Chinese traveler from Suzhou, speaking to a reporter from the Heiminsha (Common People's Society) yesterday, the incident occurred in Yangqi, outside Guakuatang, east of Suzhou. At around 10:00 AM, a Shanghai-bound train, reportedly a special train, exploded as it entered Yangqi, outside Guakuatang. The blast was powerful, shaking houses in Guakuatang town violently. The electric train, a special train of 13 carriages and one locomotive, was severely damaged. The engine and chimney were twisted and shattered. The driver and stoker, along with five or six others, were killed. Four passenger carriages were completely destroyed. The dead, numbering over two hundred, were laid out in seventeen or eighteen tents set up along the railway tracks. Many were dismembered and difficult to identify. The injured numbered over three hundred, most of whom were seriously wounded.</p>
<p>Eyewitness Account</p>
<p>According to a Mr. Xi, a Chinese traveler from Dongting East Mountain in Suzhou, who personally witnessed the scene at Suzhou Station, the train that was bombed was indeed the "Tianma Express" (formerly the Feikuai Express). The train was scheduled to depart as the third northbound train of the day, and had never had an accident before. Passengers generally considered it to be a relatively safe train. However, on that day, the train was carrying a large number of Chinese and foreign passengers, and it was rumored that the third carriage was occupied by Japanese military police. Therefore, it was targeted by the Chinese guerrilla forces in a well-planned attack. Mr. Xi had traveled from Dongshan to Suzhou that morning, taking a southbound train to Shanghai. Upon arriving at the station, he found it under special security. All passengers were detained and questioned, and anyone suspected was arrested. After about three hours, they were released, and at that time, the dead and wounded from the bombing were being transported from Guakuatang to Suzhou for burial or treatment. The bodies were dismembered, with severed limbs and heads, numbering over two hundred. The injured were covered in blood and gore, with missing limbs, many moaning and awaiting death, numbering three to four hundred. In total, the number of dead and wounded was much higher than reported, a truly horrific sight. Along the way, a severed woman's finger was found, the nail still painted with bright red nail polish. Mr. Xi was released at Suzhou Station, but with no trains available, he could not return to Dongshan. Unable to find accommodation without a local guarantor, he spent the night at a barber shop. In the evening, he saw flames rising from the Guakuatang area, illuminating the scene as if it were daylight. He learned that a large number of Japanese military police had been dispatched to the scene and were conducting house-to-house searches in nearby villages, setting fire to vacant houses with kerosene.</p>

<p>According to the *Dalu Xinbao*, the *Seiryu Maru*, belonging to the Chengcheng Company (承承公司), a Japanese company located at 115 Jiangxi Road, was robbed near Baipu on the left bank of the lower Yangtze River at 11:00 PM on Thursday. The "pirates" numbered over three hundred. Two Chinese were killed, and one Japanese was injured. All the cargo was looted. The Japanese army has dispatched troops to search for the perpetrators.</p>

<p>The Russian Queen, which had been chartered by the British Admiralty in Hong Kong to replace mail services previously provided by ships that were ordered to halt their voyages, and which the Changxing Company (昌興公司) operated on the Europe-Asia route, and which sailed between Shanghai, Japan, the Pacific, Europe, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Singapore, and other destinations, has had its schedule disrupted since the outbreak of war. To prevent maritime accidents, all British and French ships no longer announce their schedules. According to reliable sources from the *Xinsheng She* (New Voice News Agency), the ship, which was originally scheduled to depart</p>
<p>From Hong Kong to Shanghai</p>
<p>On November 30th, and which was scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, heading to London and San Francisco via ports in Canada and Australia, and on which the Shanghai Post Office had loaded a large amount of mail and New Year's cards bound for Europe, was temporarily seized for military use by the British Far East Naval Command upon arriving in Hong Kong. It has been dispatched to await orders in the waters of the Far East. As a result, all mail bound for Europe had to be transferred to the President Coolidge to be transported to America and then to Europe.</p>
<p>The President Coolidge</p>
<p>The *President Coolidge* was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Manila and Hong Kong on the 7th of this month, but was delayed en route and did not arrive until 8:00 AM on the 9th, berthing at buoys 12 and 13. Passengers and baggage were transferred to the connecting ferry *Madong Hao*, disembarking at the New Customs Wharf at 8:45 AM. The ship remained in port for one day, departing at 6:00 PM the following afternoon, heading to San Francisco and Los Angeles via Kobe, Yokohama, and Honolulu. The last ferry was scheduled to depart from the New Customs Wharf at 4:30 PM that afternoon. Tickets for the ship were nearly sold out after the State Council ordered the evacuation of overseas Chinese. However, no American citizens joined the evacuation on that ship.</p>

<p>The Yangzhen Ginseng Shop (養眞參號) at No. 403, West Section of Zhengli, Fada Road, was robbed by bandits at 7:15 PM on the 30th of last month (the day before yesterday). A shop assistant ran out, and a detective mistook him for a robber, shooting him dead. Details were briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been learned that there were</p>
<p>Two People Killed by Mistake</p>
<p>The following are further details of the incident. The Yangzhen Ginseng Shop was originally located on Guazi Street in the Nanshi area. After the August 13th incident, it moved to its branch location and the business flourished. This attracted the attention of robbers. At 7:15 PM on the 30th of last month, the shop had just finished dinner when four robbers suddenly appeared. One robber stood guard at the main entrance with a handgun, while the other two searched the shop. They opened the drawer of the accounting desk and robbed over 600 yuan in cash from the sale of goods.</p>
<p>As they were fleeing with the loot</p>
<p>A patrol officer on the street became aware of the robbery and reported it to the French police station. Detectives were immediately dispatched in patrol cars to intercept the robbers. Sun Bo-xiang (22 years old), a shop assistant from Ningbo, fearing that the detectives would engage in a gunfight with the robbers and cause further harm, ran out of the shop and hid on the ground inside the Yuanshunxiang Porcelain Shop (源順祥磁器店) at No. 391, five doors to the east. Yan Zhong-min (28 years old), a shop assistant from Hubei at the Yuanshunxiang Porcelain Shop, seeing Sun running into his shop and</p>
<p>Hiding on the Ground</p>
<p>Also squatted down with Sun. Unexpectedly, a Western policeman passed by on a motorcycle, heard of the robbery, saw Sun Bo-xiang running into the Yuanshunxiang Porcelain Shop and squatting down, and saw Yan following him and squatting down. Mistaking Sun and Yan for robbers, he stopped his motorcycle, drew his service handgun, ran inside, and fired several shots at Sun and Yan, all hitting vital organs. They were rushed to Guangci Hospital, but died shortly after. The four robbers, seeing the Chinese and Western detectives arriving, fled into the crowd of pedestrians with the loot and</p>
<p>Escaped Without a Trace</p>
<p>Yesterday, the police sent the bodies of Sun and Yan to the mortuary on Terrace Road for examination. The families of the deceased were notified to claim the bodies for burial. Meanwhile, the police department ordered all detectives to rigorously pursue the fleeing robbers and bring them to justice. It is also reported that the families of the deceased are aggrieved that their loved ones were innocently and tragically killed and may file a protest.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA), recognizing the importance of improving children's lives and promoting children's education, has invited experts and enthusiasts in children's affairs to serve as committee members. After months of research, they have determined that daycare centers for working mothers are extremely important, especially for working-class families. They are piloting two daycare centers: (1) at No. 323, Muirhead Road, for children of working mothers, who will be sent to the center in the morning and picked up in the evening. (2) at the Tongren Hospital on Route Ghisi, for children whose parents work and cannot provide them with proper care, or for orphans with no one to care for them. Services will be completely free. Preparations are underway, with the goal of opening in January of next year. However, the initial and operating expenses are substantial. The YWCA welcomes any individual in society who is interested in childcare and willing to provide financial or material assistance (such as cribs, bedding, tents, desk lamps, and all kinds of children's equipment). To raise funds for the daycare center, the YWCA will hold a charity sale on December 8th. Details have been published in previous newspapers. The charity sale will feature a wide variety of items. Those who wish to purchase tickets should do so as soon as possible to avoid missing the opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have read your news report of December 1st, regarding the general strike of the dyeing industry and the authorities' efforts to mediate the situation. This does not conform to the facts. Our Association received a letter from the Shanghai Dyeing Industry Association, stating that the dyeing prices were chaotic and needed to be rectified. In order to unify the charges, they refused to accept dyeing, and asked for cooperation with our Association. The workers' alcohol money was low. It remained at the old price of 30 cents per pack, which was set in the 1927 agreement. This was increased by one fold to 60 cents per pack. Although this increase is less compared to the current environment and prices, our Association complied with the employer's orders and signed an agreement with them. On October 11th, the new price for alcohol money was implemented. The issue of rectifying the unified dyeing price for dyeing factories and silk cloth merchants is a separate matter. The dispute involving Chen Xiqin and others was caused by the factory dyeing without the customer's permission and the general shutdown period. This has nothing to do with our Association's increase in alcohol money. Our association's workers stop and start dyeing according to the will of the dyeing factory owners. It is not a joint strike by dye workers, as they are passively stopping work. I am reporting the facts and hope that you will correct the record and ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Shanghai Silk and Satin Dyeing Industry Friendship Association</p>
<p>December 1st</p>

<p>The Beitang Library does not have a large number of books in terms of quantity. Newly published books are rare. However, the value of the books is very high. The library currently has about 5,400 ancient Western books. Among the rare books are over twenty of the original possessions of the Nantang and the famous works of Father Clavius, Matteo Ricci's mathematics teacher. One of the books contains the original author's autograph given to Matteo Ricci.</p>
<p>There are also hundreds of books with the Society of Jesus emblem printed on the back. These were gifts from Pope Paul V (during the Wanli period) to Yu Nigao (按卽號稱七千部西來圖書之一部份, 按卽號稱七千部西來圖書之一部份 means approximately "part of what's known as the seven thousand books from the West"). There are also books originally possessed by the Xitang and donated by Archbishop Carlo. Carlo was sent by Pope Clement XI in 1715 (Kangxi 55th year) as a special envoy to China to resolve the Chinese Rites Controversy. There are also books originally possessed by the Beitang, stamped with the seal of King Louis XIV of France and the seals of famous French officials and dignitaries. Other books are the original texts of famous scientific and religious works translated by famous scholars among the missionaries and Catholics of the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, such as Tang Ruowang, Nan Huairen, Xu Guangqi, and Li Zhizao. There are also several types of manuscripts, all of which have been preserved to this day. There is a rich collection of theological books published at that time. There is also a considerable collection of books on European science, art, literature, law, history, medicine, and biology from that period. However, the most treasured book is Father Sande's *Study of the Envoys Sent by Japan to the Holy See*, printed by the Jesuits in Macau in 1590. It is also the first European book printed in the Far East. In addition to the Beitang, only the British Royal Library has a copy. The oldest European-printed book is from 1479 (Ming Hongzhi 7th year). There are 80,000 Chinese books. A portion of these are imperial gifts from Qing emperors, and are quite valuable. Among the rare books are Song and Ming editions, old manuscript gazetteers, and works from the Wuyingdian Juchen Edition (武央殿聚珍本業書).</p>
<p>Although the Beitang Library's collection is extremely valuable, it is not managed by experts. Therefore, while the priests in the church can borrow books freely, access is restricted for outsiders. After the founding of the Republic of China, scholars such as Ma Xiangbo, Ying Lianzhi, Chen Yuan'an, and Xu Runnong, as well as French scholars Paul Pelliot and Henri Bernard, were introduced and were able to view the collection. Thus, the original edition of the Mingli Tan Zhi (名理探之), a Japanese catechism book from the 16th century, and Pedrini's famous compositions were discovered. Scholars around the world were amazed and felt the need for reorganization. The church partnered with Dr. John Leighton Stuart, president of Yenching University in Peiping, Dr. Henry Houghton, president of Peking Union Medical College, and William Pettus, principal of the Chinese Language School, in addition to the assistance of Bev F. Goertz, head of the Psychology Department of Fu Jen Catholic University, and C.D. Lyon, secretary of the US Embassy, to obtain a special grant from the Rockefeller Foundation to repair and catalogue the collection. Father Lu of Fu Jen Catholic University and Father Hui, the librarian, are currently leading the work of converting to steel shelving and cataloguing the collection. They plan to photograph the title pages of each rare book and send a complete set, along with catalogue cards and a book inventory, to the Vatican Library, the Library of Congress in the United States, and the Rockefeller Foundation. The catalogue cards will also be distributed to a few libraries.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Office of the Chinese Benevolent Children's Association began soliciting winter clothing for impoverished children in the city on the 20th of last month, it has received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life. It has already received over 6,500 yuan in donations and over 300 pieces of new and used winter clothing. Currently, work is being intensified to actively solicit more. Since the sudden cold snap this winter, the number of homeless street children freezing to death in the city has been increasing daily. If rescue measures are not taken promptly as the cold worsens, this tragic phenomenon will become unimaginable. The association earnestly hopes that all sectors will contribute quickly, so that winter clothing can be manufactured and distributed as soon as possible to benefit impoverished children. Anyone willing to donate new or used winter clothing or a winter clothing allowance (6 yuan per set) can call 82273. The association will dispatch a special messenger with a receipt to collect the donation. Furthermore, the association has formulated regulations for this winter clothing campaign, including solicitation rewards and distribution methods.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Yesterday's North China Daily News Cup Preliminary Round: Yu You Crushes Weituoning, Leaving the Enemy with a Clean Sweep of 5-0; Rising Star Hua Lian Suffers Defeat in First Round <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Following the opening of the North China Daily News Cup football tournament the day before yesterday, three more matches were held yesterday. At the Race Club, Su Ke'er lost to Aosimeng 0-1, a remarkable upset. At Route de Ghisi, Hua Lian, a rising force in Chinese football, also lost to mediocre First-Class Zeng 1-3. In the previous乙组(Second Division), First-Class lost all ten matches, conceding over 130 goals and scoring only one. This year, they were relegated to丙组(Third Division), and their record remains lackluster. Compared to Hua Lian, they are worlds apart. Although First-Class had other star players assisting yesterday, they were merely like a wren nesting in the forest, occupying only a single branch. Liao Hua's vanguard ultimately lacked merit. It is a pity that Hua Lian was too eager to win, resulting in the opposite outcome. Since First-Class had resigned themselves to losing, their actions were uninhibited, and under this reverse psychology, they created a major upset, eliminating Hua Lian with a 3-1 victory and advancing to the second week. In another match at Jiaozhou Park, Yu You faced Weituoning. Because admission was free, there was a large audience. Yu You's strength is inherently formidable. Recently, with the addition of Zheng Tongyu as goalkeeper, Zhang Lin'gen and Jiang Chao as defenders, the former glory of Lido has reappeared today, making their strength even more valiant. After the kickoff, Weituoning had no room to maneuver. The entire 70-minute match was dominated by Yu You, who controlled the situation meticulously. Before long, Yu You's central midfielder Wang Caigao received a brilliant pass from Ge Xizuo and opened the scoring (1-0). Not long after, Wang Caigao struck again (2-0). At halftime, Yu You was already ahead 2-0. After the break, Cao Qinfang scored first (3-0). Xu Jinda followed suit, earning thunderous applause (4-0). Soon after, Wang Caigao completed a hat-trick, scoring three goals in a row (5-0). The enemy was dumbfounded and attempted to come back, but Yu You's defense was impenetrable, and the cooperation between central midfielders Hu Wang and Tao was extremely effective. Although Weituoning harbored ambitions of breaking the cauldron and fighting with their backs to the wall, the situation was completely controlled by Yu You, forcing them to exclaim "Heaven has forsaken us!" Before long, the final whistle blew, and Weituoning's grand ambition of conquering the Central Plains vanished with the sound of the whistle. Yu You advanced to the third week of the North China Daily News Cup with a 5-0 victory. Currently, the teams that have advanced to the second week of the North China Daily News Cup, besides Yu You, First-Class, and Aosimeng from yesterday, also include the French Army, who defeated Rowing Club the day before yesterday, and Mikebie, who eliminated the French Navy, as well as the Russian Overseas Chinese Association, Russian Army, and Yousheng Society, who had a bye in the first week, totaling eight teams. The results and Yu You's lineup from yesterday are as follows:</p>
<p>North China Daily News Cup Preliminary Round Results:</p>
<p>Yu You defeated Weituoning (First Round) 5-0</p>
<p>First-Class defeated Hua Lian (First Round) 3-1</p>

<p>In yesterday's Western Union Football League, there were three matches. In the preliminary round, St. Francis lost to Portuguese Business 2-3. In the two First Division matches, St. Francis' match against the Jewish Association was a close call. The two teams' points in the standings were far apart, with St. Francis only behind Donghua, ranked second, while the Jewish Association was far outside the top five. Logically, the situation should have been one-sided, but yesterday's match saw St. Francis consistently at a disadvantage, almost being taken advantage of by the Jewish Association. Although they ultimately won 5-4, the victory was precarious. In another First Division match, French Business faced North West Child at the Race Club. North West Child led 1-0 in the first half, and the final result was a 3-3 draw.</p>

<h3 id="e78">The Knowledge Those Anesthetized by Foreign Stocks Should Have <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Sha</p>
<p>Recently, for various reasons, Shanghai's money market has become increasingly loose, the exchange discount has gradually disappeared, and the interbank lending rate offered by the Money Trade Association has been only seven or eight percent per day. Banks have been actively lowering deposit interest rates. On the one hand, this may seem like a good phenomenon. But on the other hand, crises are lurking, hidden worries are not yet over, and the future of the market is full of thorns, with pessimistic elements far outweighing optimistic ones. At present, many speculative funds are wandering aimlessly, and everywhere, people have laid down nets to wait for you to fall into the trap. Only a moment of carelessness can cause you to fall in, making it impossible to recover.</p>
<p>For the past year, buying and selling foreign stocks has become the most fashionable form of speculation or investment. Brokers in the stock exchange are all smiles, and their doors are crowded. A broker's seat can be bought for 1,000 pounds sterling, and still be hard to come by. Daily trading volume is at least two or three hundred thousand shares, and often seven or eight hundred thousand shares; weekly trading volume often reaches around forty to fifty million yuan. Huge commissions flow into their pockets, while the market price fluctuates wildly, and countless Chinese people and ladies, blindly following the trend, have been ruined.</p>
<p>When money is tight, speculators are more cautious; but when money is loose, it is the best opportunity for speculators and manipulators to become active. At the same time, clever Jews repeatedly take advantage of this opportunity to raise new capital and absorb Chinese funds. Following Xinhe Spinning Mill and others, Ewo Spinning Mill has also announced the issuance of 337,500 new shares, priced at 24 yuan per share (an premium of 19 yuan on the par value of 5 taels), with every four old shares entitled to subscribe for one new share. Following this, the Shanghai Woolen Mill will also publicly issue over 400,000 new shares between 10:00 and 10:30 AM on December 5th, with a par value of 5 yuan and a selling price of 5.5 yuan per share. The purpose of this capital increase is said to be to purchase a 23-mu piece of land from Sassoon for 11,500 pounds sterling, and to build factory buildings, etc. Buying land in Shanghai must be done in pounds sterling, and only Sassoon's land is suitable. This is irrelevant to foreign involvement and need not be mentioned. However, according to their advertisement, the commission paid to subscribers of the new shares is 131,000 yuan, and another 150,000 yuan is paid as remuneration to the promoters, which is nothing more than adding another burden to the future new shareholders.</p>
<p>People who like to buy foreign stocks often do so because the company pays generous dividends, has a thriving business, is well-managed, or has competent leadership. True, setting aside the standpoint of national economy, purely from an investment point of view, some company stocks are indeed worth buying at a reasonable price. But this is only for investors, not for speculators. Many people operating blindly are manipulated, buying when prices are irrationally high and selling when prices are irrationally low, invariably falling into traps and ending up in a mess.</p>
<p>Now, let's try to describe the distribution of foreign stocks in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Although there are many types of stocks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, they can be broadly classified into just a few groups. The larger groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Sassoon Group (including Allied Group): Includes International Trust, Yangtze Trust, Zhonghe, British &amp; Chinese Corporation, Shanghai Brewery, Cathay Land, Public Omnibus, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, etc.</p>
<p>Wheelock Marden Group: Includes Wheelock, Steel Works, China Estates &amp; Finance, etc.</p>
<p>McBain Group: Includes Shanghai Banking Corporation, China Land &amp; Finance, Lanquitz, Sumatra Consolidated Rubber Estates, etc.</p>
<p>Starr Group: Includes Heng Yeh, Sze Hai, American Asiatic Underwriters, Tai An Insurance, etc.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Group: Includes Ewo Spinning Mill, Jardine Brewery, Kung Ho Hsiang, etc.</p>
<p>祥茂(Cheung Mao) Group: Includes Anglo-French Land Investment Co., and Rubber Plantation Companies, Plantations Consolidated, Tolimein, Kotabahru Rubber Estates, Padang Rubber Estates, Glenshiel Rubber Estates, Bahru Rubber Estates, Senggar Desley, Tenamaram etc.</p>
<p>惠通(Hui Tong) Group: Rubber Plantation Companies, Alma, Indra, Ingcha-wah, Batu Anam, Chiam Chen Shi, Chava Kangsa, Capayang, Krowah, Lipai, Rubber Sing Kee, Semagaga, Siemens-Bruch, Schina Wang, Malay, Schiellanbaum, Shaw Manchus, Tepong Rubber, etc.</p>
<p>Now that the groups are clear, let's move on to discuss the issue of people. The development and stability of a company depend entirely on whether it has competent leadership. Those who have the right people prosper, and those who do not perish. In general, Shanghai's foreign companies have many shrewd and capable leaders with outstanding reputations. However, one person's energy is limited, and handling the affairs of two or three companies may be more than enough. If one person has to oversee the affairs of many companies, it is somewhat forced. If one is just going through the motions and acting as a "Yes man" everywhere, it is not showing respect to the shareholders and may even arouse the concerns of outsiders. Many people often cite the example of wealthy Chinese people holding dozens of positions as a topic of conversation, but who knew that Shanghai's foreign entrepreneurs are not letting wealthy Chinese people have all the glory. If you don't believe me, take a look at the following individuals:</p>
<p>Dawey (Sassoon Group) serves as director of the following companies: Cathay Land, Zhonghe, International, Yangtze, Wheelock, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, Zong Guang Ho, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, Steel Works, Shanghai Brewery, Public Omnibus, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, Shanghai Tug &amp; Lighter, etc.</p>
<p>Arnhold, H.E. (Sassoon Group) serves as director of the following companies: Zhonghe, Sze Hai, International, Yangtze, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, Public Omnibus, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, etc.</p>
<p>Meager (Sassoon Group) serves as director of the following companies: Cathay Land, Zhonghe, Yangtze, International, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, Shanghai Brewery, Public Omnibus, etc.</p>
<p>Ovadia (Sassoon Group) serves as director of the following companies: Cathay Land, Zhonghe, Allied, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, Shanghai Brewery, etc.</p>
<p>Mardon (Wheelock Marden Group) serves as director of the following companies: Wheelock, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, Shanghai Tug &amp; Lighter, China Estates &amp; Finance, Steel Works, International, Yangtze, China Land &amp; Finance, Sumatra Consolidated Rubber Estates, Xinhe, Sze Hai, Shanghai Woolen Mill, Heng Yeh, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, etc.</p>
<p>McBain (McBain Group) serves as director of the following companies: Shanghai Banking Corporation, International, Yangtze, Lanquitz, China Land &amp; Finance, Sumatra Consolidated Rubber Estates, Shanghai &amp; Hongkew Wharf, Public Omnibus, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, the Kadocrie father and son and Welch of the Hui Tong Group and Rubber Plantation companies, Brand and Meller of the Xiang Mao Group and Rubber Plantation companies serve as directors, which is of course not to be excluded. In short, no matter how big Shanghai is and how many types of foreign stocks there are, most cannot escape the grasp of these foreign entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The management of foreign companies affects shareholders differently due to different policies. For example, the Shanghai Waterworks Company first issued sterling bonds. Before August 13th, the company's management, concerned that the exchange rate might change, resolutely redeemed them and reissued silver dollar bonds. To this day, shareholders have benefited greatly; otherwise, not only would dividends be uncertain, but consumers' burdens would have increased even more than they are now. This is a good example. Conversely, Cathay Land, in 1936, converted its debt of over 9 million national currency owed to Sassoon Bank into 598,600 pounds sterling. It is said that the purpose of the conversion was to reduce the interest rate from 6% to 5% to alleviate the company's burden. However, at the end of last year, this sterling loan was listed on its report as 30,854,013 yuan. In order to save 1% interest, a debt of over 20 million yuan was created out of thin air. Given the current situation, not only will shareholders' capital be lost, but even the security of bondholders will be jeopardized. Such unexpected losses were probably not anticipated by those who invested in the past.</p>
<p>Shareholders should, in theory, have the opportunity to inquire about the company's operations, but this is not the case in foreign companies. Their directors are pre-selected and not elected by shareholders, and the same is true for important matters of reform in the company. The annual shareholders' meeting is just a formality, and it is often held during business hours, such as at 11:30 AM, making it impossible for many shareholders to attend.</p>
<p>In short, investing in foreign stocks is not impossible, but you must have a real understanding of the nature of the stock and have a strong grasp of the company's business before you can get involved. Whether the interest rate is worthwhile is closely related to whether the investment is worthwhile. For example, public utility stocks, such as telephone stocks, are certainly stable and reliable, but if you insist on raising the price to 40 or 50 yuan to buy shares with a par value of 10 yuan, no matter how much the telephone charges increase, the legal income will not exceed 8% of the par value, so it is self-evident whether it is worth it or not.</p>
<p>Finally, China needs a large amount of capital, and many high-profit enterprises in the mainland are waiting for Shanghai's funds to develop. In addition, many well-performing Chinese company shares, government bonds, and national construction savings certificates are all good investment destinations. I sincerely hope that those who are anesthetized by foreign stocks will wake up soon!</p>
<h3 id="e79">On China's Rural Economic Construction <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Xiaoyun</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War has lasted for three and a half years. During this long period of resistance, China has lost vast territories, a dozen important cities, and incalculable lives and property. However, China has not only not collapsed but has become stronger as it fights. If we want to explore the cause and effect of this great resistance, which foreigners marvel at as a "miracle," then in addition to political and military reasons, China's national economy—more precisely, the resilient Chinese rural economy—is undoubtedly the most powerful factor that has enabled China to resist for so long.</p>
<p>Since China's ability to sustain the war is due to the resilience of the rural economy's self-sufficiency, then, in order to strengthen the economic power of the resistance, to solve the people's livelihood problems during the war, and to expand and improve agricultural production, actively promoting rural economic construction is, at this stage, an urgent task.</p>
<p>Before discussing the main topic of China's rural economic construction, let's briefly examine how the Chinese rural economy has changed due to the impact of the war.</p>
<p>Changes in China's Rural Economy After the War</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the changes that have occurred in China's rural economy after the war are significant. Now, let's discuss the rural economy in the occupied areas and the rural economy in the free areas.</p>
<p>A. Rural Economy in Occupied Areas In the occupied areas such as North China and Central China, due to the war, the rural economy has suffered enormous damage and destruction. Countless rural people have fled and migrated. Rural houses have been burned down by artillery fire. Farmland crops have been trampled and devastated, especially the bombing of the Yellow River dikes. The surging Yellow River has submerged millions of rural fields and destroyed countless lives and property.</p>
<p>Taking Central China as an example, according to estimates by the Continental Daily, in the area along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway alone, there are more than ten million farmers who are hungry, cold, and on the verge of starvation. In North China, according to a Reuters dispatch on March 27 of this year, in central Hebei Province, there are six million farmers on the verge of desperation, and in eastern Hebei Province, at least four million farmers are about to starve to death. These farmers are using tree bark and grass roots to fill their stomachs. All cats and dogs have been eaten. In some areas where wheat seedlings are just growing, farmers who have no food have taken the seedlings to fill their stomachs. In addition, farmers using aquatic plants, sawdust, dead stalks, cotton wadding, and chaff to fill their stomachs are everywhere. The number of families committing suicide due to lack of food is increasing day by day. Judging from the miserable lives of these farmers, it is confirmed how serious the bankruptcy of the rural economy in the occupied areas is!</p>
<p>Of course, the occupied areas are not entirely like this now. With the development of guerrilla warfare and the establishment of guerrilla base areas, especially due to the active rural economic construction in some areas and the implementation of cooperation between the military and civilians, such as soldiers assisting farmers in planting, herding cattle, weeding, and harvesting during the busy farming season, and soldiers helping farmers raise pigs, herd cattle, raise sheep, and grow vegetables in their spare time, the new rural economy is rapidly growing and prospering in these areas.</p>
<p>B. Rural Economy in Free Areas In the free areas not occupied by Japan, at the beginning of the war, due to the blockade along the Yangtze River and the coast, and the occupation of many large cities, the rural economy once showed a sluggish state due to the widespread stagnation of agricultural products and the interruption of rural financial circulation. However, it soon recovered and gradually turned to prosperity. The increasing prosperity of the rural economy in the free areas can be proven by the statistics made by the customs. For example, in Longzhou, Guangxi, the total import in 1938 was 2.73 million yuan, and the export was 4.25 million yuan. In 1939, the total import was 36.439 million yuan, and the export was 57.602 million yuan, with a trade surplus of 21.163 million yuan, almost twice the import. In Mengzi, Yunnan, the customs situation was similar. In Mengzi in 1938, the import was 11.465 million yuan, and the export was 40.718 million yuan, with a trade surplus of 29.253 million yuan, with exports almost four times the imports. In addition to Longzhou and Mengzi, the trade of various customs in free areas such as Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Liuzhou also had trade surpluses, and almost all of the exports were agricultural products.</p>
<p>Why are the rural economy in the guerrilla base areas in the occupied areas and the rural economy in the free areas becoming increasingly developed and prosperous? In our opinion, this is not accidental, but has many objective factors.</p>
<p>First, because the transportation lines along the Yangtze River and the coast were blockaded by Japan, and many large cities were successively occupied, the suction tubes of foreign capital extending into China's vast rural areas were cut off. The roads for British and American goods to flow into China's rural areas were blocked. Second, due to the severe damage to China's national industry, and the inability of Japanese goods to pour in on a large scale without hindrance due to China's implementation of economic counter-blockade, the vast people in the rural areas of the free areas and guerrilla base areas still had a demand for industrial products. Under such circumstances, it naturally created extremely favorable conditions for the re-emergence of rural handicrafts and the prosperity of the rural economy.</p>
<p>Premises for Promoting Rural Economic Construction</p>
<p>The changes in China's rural economy after the war have been described above. But how should we take advantage of these favorable conditions to promote rural economic construction and enrich the economic power of long-term resistance? This is the most important and most pressing issue. Of course, we cannot deny that in the past three years of the war, due to the government's active coordination and supervision, and the efforts of the financial community and the vast people, the rural economy in the free areas has achieved considerable results. However, in order to make rural economic construction able to solve the problem more quickly and effectively, it is necessary to:</p>
<p>1. Land Issue The land issue can be said to be the most central and complex issue in China's rural economic construction. Although the land owned by China is extremely vast, due to the uneven distribution of China's population (such as in some places, there are too many people and too little land, while in some places, the land is so barren that no one cultivates it) and the fact that most of the land ownership is concentrated in the hands of landlords, China's agricultural productivity cannot be strongly developed. Although the government has paid attention to this after the war, in reality, there has not been much change. We believe that to promote rural economic construction at present, we must first solve the land issue. This not only requires the planned relocation of refugees from the war zones and people from densely populated areas to the border areas to expand the reclamation movement, but also requires all provinces to try their best to reclaim all wasteland to increase the production of food and other goods. In addition, the government should, in accordance with the Prime Minister's advocacy of "equal land rights," further restrict the concentration of land in the hands of landlords, such as confiscating land exceeding a certain area owned by farmers and distributing this land and ownerless wasteland to landless or land-poor farmers and tenant farmers for use.</p>
<p>2. Rural Financial Issues Whether rural production can be increased is closely related to the financial abundance of farmers. The income of Chinese farmers is generally very meager due to the limited cultivated land. Each farm family relies on only a few acres of land to live on. Even without floods or droughts, it is extremely difficult for their income to maintain the lives of a "family of five." Due to the poverty of farmers in normal times, many are unable to store seeds for the following year. When the new grain is harvested, it is immediately sold to repay old debts, and their subsequent lives must be sustained by high-interest loans. As a result, they bear a heavier burden, and the farmers' economy becomes increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>After the war, the burden on farmers in the free areas has undeniably increased considerably, and the burden on farmers in the occupied areas has become even heavier. Although the Ministry of Finance has announced the abolition of all exorbitant taxes and levies in order to reduce the burden on the people during the war, such as the complete abolition of taxes and levies in the occupied areas, and the postponement or reduction of various taxes and levies in the war zones, in reality, this order has not been widely implemented except in one or two provinces. Many farmers in the occupied areas are not only cruelly exploited by exorbitant taxes and levies from a certain party, but some guerrilla forces even illegally impose levies on farmers without authorization. What is even more important is that the various super-economic exploitation of farmers by general landlords and the bone-sucking exploitation of high-interest loans have plunged countless farmers into a miserable situation! Although banks have successively moved inland after the war, and banks in various places are competing to make rural loans, due to poor management, most of the low-interest loans are absorbed by landlords and usurers in the countryside, who lend them to farmers at high interest, so that farmers cannot benefit. Therefore, to promote rural economic construction at present, we must first seek the development of rural finance, thoroughly and universally abolish exorbitant taxes and levies, reduce rents and interest, and the government should stipulate the maximum interest rate for loans and strictly crack down on the heavy exploitation of high-interest loans. The principal and interest of old debts owed by farmers should also be temporarily suspended during the war.</p>
<p>3. Improvement of Agricultural Production Technology The methods of agricultural management, cultivation techniques, and tools in China have mostly followed the old methods for thousands of years, with very little improvement. Chinese farmers in general do not know how to select and improve seeds and fertilizers, nor do they know how to prevent and control pests. What is even more important is water conservancy. China has not only not actively built water conservancy projects to benefit farmland, but has allowed it to overflow and cause disasters. The continuous water and drought disasters in China over the years have damaged the rural economy to an extent that is in fact no less than the aggression of the capital of the great powers. It is precisely because of the above reasons that China's agricultural productivity has never been able to develop. In the future, to promote rural economic construction and develop agricultural productivity, we must actively improve agricultural production technology, such as preventing and controlling pests to increase agricultural output, improving fertilizers, changing the soil, turning barren land into fertile fields, building water conservancy projects, planting forests to protect farmland from drought and floods, encouraging spring plowing, and promoting production competitions, so that production movements surge in all provinces, counties, towns, and villages to increase the production of food and other goods and consolidate the economic foundation of the resistance war. Otherwise, agricultural productivity can never be developed and expanded.</p>
<p>4. Reform of Rural Institutions The main reason why China's rural economic construction after the war has not achieved satisfactory results to date is the unsoundness of rural political institutions. The "Baobabia system" currently implemented in rural areas is mostly controlled by local bullies and rascals. Not only can it not be used as a foundation for uniting the people and promoting rural economic construction, but it has become the best tool for these elements to oppress and exploit farmers. The agricultural cooperative movement promoted in rural areas in recent years is also mostly controlled by these elements, making it impossible for most poor farmers to participate in cooperatives and work hard to produce. Therefore, to promote rural economic construction in the future, we must actively reform rural political institutions. If the administrative institutions below the county level can be thoroughly reformed, so that the party, government, army, and people are united and cooperate closely, it will not be difficult to eliminate the evil forces that hinder rural economic construction, and rural economic construction will surely be rapidly promoted.</p>
<p>Rural economic construction is the most important link in the entire national economic construction movement. The development of China's rural economic construction is also the gradual realization of the highest ideal of the Principle of People's Livelihood.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Financial Review (Continued) <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>After the United States granted China a third loan of US$25 million on September 27, rumors spread that the United States would actively provide China with economic assistance and was conducting negotiations with Mr. Song Ziwen. Reuters also reported that Mr. Jones of the United States said that China could accept credit loans from the United States, and that the United States was considering purchasing new raw materials from China, including some important minerals and certain items that had not been purchased from China in the loan terms. Since then, news of loans has continued, but there has been no definite development. In the past two days, news from Washington has indicated that the United States is about to grant China another large loan, and a relatively definite decision has been made. Mr. Jones stated: "The more difficult China's situation becomes, the more we hope to do our best to help it." Reuters reported on the 29th that the new loan to China may be established tomorrow. If it is delayed, the United States may take other measures, which may involve further embargoes against Japan to protest Japan's recognition of the "Nanjing government."</p>
<p>Due to the undying ambition of Japanese aggression, the United States and Japan have become acutely opposed to each other. Recently, due to Japan's active advance southward, the United States and Japan may have a war in the South Pacific at any time. In terms of interests, in order to maintain its rights and interests in the Far East, the United States naturally has no choice but to do its best to economically aid China before a US-Japan war breaks out in order to contain Japan's aggression in the South Pacific. Therefore, there is no doubt that the United States will grant China a new loan.</p>
<p>China's debt repayment ability has been greatly enhanced since the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Highway on October 18. The average daily amount of tung oil transported from Chongqing to Rangoon is as high as 100 tons. According to the statistics of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the amount of tung oil exported from Cheqing or via Chongqing in September was 5,553.75 quintals, and in October it was 9,098.43 quintals, an increase of 3,540 quintals. According to the report of the Sichuan Tung Oil Trading Company, the purchasing agency of the Reconstruction Trade Company of the Ministry of Finance, 12,000 tons of tung oil were purchased from June to October of this year, and it is expected that the number will reach 15,000 tons by the end of this year. Mr. Jones pointed out that the previous transactions between China and the United States were extremely satisfactory, and China is continuing to fulfill its obligations to export tung oil, tin, and other goods. Given China's good creditworthiness and strong ability to repay debts, why has this new loan been delayed? The focus of the problem is on: (1) the United States is considering some new raw materials, such as important minerals, that have not been purchased; (2) how the United States can find a way to purchase a large amount of goods from China within one or two years. The author firmly believes that after these two points are satisfactorily resolved, the new loan will definitely be announced at the most appropriate time. (The End)</p>

<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Snuff (1)</p>
<p>Among the tobaccos, the only one that is not burned with fire and is not inhaled through the mouth is snuff. As the name suggests, it is known that it is inhaled through the nose.</p>
<p>Snuff is a brownish-yellow powder. According to legend, in the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty (16th century), when Italian priests such as Matteo Ricci came to China, it was used as a tribute and began to become popular. This is indeed possible. It is said that the production of snuff is mostly the amateur work of priests in monasteries, and their methods are kept secret. Therefore, the snuff produced by each monastery has its own differences. Snuff, of course, is made from tobacco leaves, but its ingredients are sometimes mixed with grape wine, and sometimes mixed with rose dew. Various flower dews and fruit wines are used to make snuffs with different colors and fragrances. It is said that the method of making it is to first soak the tobacco leaves in flower dew, place them in a jar, and bury them underground. After a certain period of time, they are taken out to make snuff. Then they are evaluated against each other. The good ones are not easy to find, and they are famous for a while.</p>
<p>Snuff is not only loved by officials and gentry in China, but also in ancient France and other countries, when entering university, one must learn to snuff. This shows that it is necessary for social interaction in the upper class. Snuff is a finished product of tobacco leaves and flower dew, so it does not get rid of the sour and spicy smell. Even a sour taste is considered to be the best. Although the way to snuff is the same using the nose, the techniques of Chinese and Westerners are different. Westerners snuff by taking a pinch of snuff and drawing it into the nose. Chinese people snuff by gently dipping the snuff with their fingers, pressing it against the nostrils, and inhaling it slightly. At the moment of this slight inhalation, they close their eyes and contemplate, holding their breath and carefully distinguishing the sour and spicy taste of the snuff, and judging its quality accordingly.</p>
<p>Because snuff was favored by gentry and officials, it became a trend, which led to peddlers and servants to imitate it. Mr. Zhu once said to me: You can tell the degree of their snuff by looking at the hand gestures they use with their fingers. Experts mostly use the ring finger; those who are not used to snuffing often use the little finger to dip the snuff. In addition, those who use the thumb can tell at a glance that they are not refined people. Their snuff must be inferior, so the amount they take is large. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Anpin</p>
<p>Poverty is not one's own sin, except when it results from one's own depravity. Helping the poor naturally involves a little benevolence, rising up to provide relief. However, some do it to seek merit, plant seeds of good fortune, using tangible wealth to seek intangible blessings. As for those who handle the work of helping the poor—such as charitable organizations—they don't necessarily contribute money or goods; they merely exert effort. Yet, many act presumptuously, as if they were great benefactors and philanthropists, forgetting the saying, "Greedy for great merit, thinking it is already theirs," which is inauspicious.</p>
<p>Distributing cotton-padded clothes is originally to pity the poor who are freezing to death, so providing a set to ward off the cold is well-intentioned. However, how to distribute cotton-padded clothes is not difficult in rural societies, but in the most mobile cities, it's not easy to do well. You may think of the poor begging on the streets, but forget that many, though no less poor, are huddled in shacks. Moreover, there are many hidden poor living in houses, crying out for food without rice, lamenting the cold without clothes. Let's not talk about them today.</p>
<p>Nowadays, most great philanthropists fear losing sight of the purpose of helping against the cold. They also fear that opium addicts on the streets, who consume red pills and white flour, will take a set of clothes, pawn it for opium money, and continue to beg. Therefore, they seek ways to prevent this misuse. They devised a method of making the clothes in two colors. The cotton-padded jackets have the body and sleeves, and the cotton-padded pants have the legs and crotch, all divided into gray and black to distinguish them, with a stamp added to the clothes to prohibit pawning. Adding a stamp to prohibit pawning is an old method, but no matter how the stamp is applied, pawnbrokers will still pawn them. If they won't accept them, sellers won't buy them. Thus, those giving the clothes originally want the recipients to wear them, and the recipients have no way to convert them. Who knew that the gentlemen of the charitable organization, probably having managed prisons for years, are used to seeing prisoners' clothes in two colors, also divided into two colors. This strange and peculiar clothing, meant to be recognized at a glance as donated clothes, is somewhat unkind. Especially Buddhism, which emphasizes equality and compassion, ironically separates people into classes like Brahmanism. With this ingrained discrimination, if the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas knew, would they not say, "Excellent, excellent!"?</p>
<p>A sense of shame and aversion is inherent in everyone. Wearing donated clothes, except for those who know no shame, will always cause some discomfort. If the recipient feels bad, does the giver feel good? If they do feel good, then it's not the intention of a benevolent person! I hope that those who run charities will respect the dignity of those being helped. People are always people. Don't fawn obsequiously over wealthy donors, while arbitrarily insulting the pitiful poor. That would be much better than burning incense and chanting Buddha's name!</p>

<p>— Wang Shui</p>
<p>Whenever there are essay contests, I always participate eagerly, viewing it as an opportunity to practice my writing skills. I feel that the seven or eight compositions assigned each semester in school are not enough to satisfy a young person's "desire to write."</p>
<p>I was delighted to find in the newspaper the</p>
<p>Soap Scholarship essay topic. At the same time, I also felt ashamed, as a senior high school student, I'm not qualified to write this article because I don't even understand [the topic]. For days, I've asked nearly a hundred classmates about this topic, and believe it or not, only a few could answer.</p>
<p>Although essay contests have various purposes, the universal goal is to develop young people's thinking and encourage students' writing. Since there's a common goal, I don't understand why some people always like to quote one or two famous passages from classical texts to mock young people's ideas.</p>

<p>— Dai Niao</p>
<p>After finishing today's last meal, I leisurely began to chat. However, since the speakers were an elementary school teacher and myself, an office worker, entertainment was naturally out of the question. Talking about life? How could that be "comfortable"? It's better to be sensible and talk about other people's affairs. The elementary school teacher mentioned the phone rate increase.</p>
<p>Is the phone rate increase someone else's business? Yes, that's right. The person who raised the question continued, "The people at the stock exchange don't care about these few cents."</p>
<p>"I only answer the phone; I don't need to spend money. Even for personal matters, I can skim off the company's expenses." Saying this, I felt too despicable.</p>
<p>The elementary school teacher chuckled, "Probably because you're skimming too often, that's why the rates are increasing."</p>
<p>Although somewhat embarrassed, a counterattack was unavoidable. "Since we pay a monthly fee, there shouldn't be limits. Besides, business is so booming that they're overwhelmed. It's impossible to even get a phone installed. This rate increase is really unreasonable!"</p>
<p>"Idiot!" he lectured me. "Why don't you bring out the big hat of 'public utilities'? They calculate in 'US dollars'. Streetcars, buses, tap water, and heating have all increased in price; phones naturally can't be exempt!" After a pause, "Besides, their staff and workers are constantly clamoring for pay raises!"</p>
<p>Reasonable, I admired him secretly.</p>
<p>"Actually, when else are they going to make money if not now?" he said excitedly. "Those rice weevils and profiteers are scolded incessantly, yet they still do whatever they want. Isn't it all for money? Ultimately, it's the poor guys like us who suffer. With this rate increase and that rate increase, they say the rent will increase again tomorrow, and rice will rise to one hundred dollars a dan." This was followed by a sigh.</p>
<p>Rice, rent, like a bolt from the blue, I couldn't say a word. I silently climbed into bed, blaming myself for why talking about other people's affairs led to talking about my own! ...</p>
<p>The Detective Stories of Hawthorne</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 12: Report and Explanation</p>
<p>That sigh deeply affected me. I felt that while material civilization can certainly improve the enjoyment of life, it also serves as the primary cause of humans fighting and killing each other. For thousands of years, traditional Chinese thought has adopted an attitude of suppression and disdain towards material aspects. Confucius said, "A scholar who is devoted to the Way and ashamed of bad clothes and bad food is not worth discussing with." This statement can represent everything. As a result of this thinking, while we may not have achieved much in the material sphere, the phenomenon of social disputes and killings has perhaps been relatively reduced. Since our door was knocked open, this country has been lagging behind materially. However, once our material desires are ignited by this temptation, they cannot be simultaneously reduced because we cannot produce them ourselves. Therefore, the eyes of ordinary people in urban society are focused on readily available enjoyments. As a result, society has become more chaotic, and national strength has been eroded day by day!</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou didn't feel anything. He continued to urge Hawthorne, "Now that the old man is dead, his actions can no longer be confirmed. I can only ask you to explain." Hawthorne said, "His actions are also very simple. I believe my one-sided guess is not far from the truth. On the seventeenth night, after persuading his son to return to his room, he knew the situation had reached a deadlock. In order to salvage the situation, he may have made the decision to murder. When he sent his son out yesterday morning, he probably quietly bought this knife, planning to find an opportunity to strike. Situationally, he couldn't stay in the Li Lan's home for much longer, so the opportunity to strike couldn't be delayed; it had to be implemented quickly. When he returned yesterday morning, he heard Yu Gantang threatening over the phone, and he thought he could frame little Yu, a great opportunity, so he decided to take action last night."</p>
<p>"Last night, after he read the newspaper and went upstairs, it rained. He must have thought this was another best coincidence. After going upstairs, he certainly couldn't sleep. His room was next to Jin Mei's bedroom. After Jin Mei turned off the lights and fell asleep, he quietly went downstairs to prepare. He went to the first floor and pushed open Li Lan's bedroom. You all know her door isn't locked. He must have entered and exited her room several times, seeing a pair of leather shoes in the closet. He took Lu Jiansheng's leather shoes, perhaps bringing them upstairs, or perhaps leaving them near the stairs, waiting for temporary use." (183)</p>

<h3 id="e94">The Medicine of Tomorrow <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>——Public Understanding Required——</p>
<p>Medicine is not a charitable enterprise. The more advanced medicine is, the more excellent the nation and the more advanced its construction. This is an immutable truth. Since medicine is so important, it cannot be effective without gathering talent and specialized equipment, and studying and expanding it meticulously. Our country has always mistakenly believed that medicine belongs to a passive charitable enterprise. Looking at the backwardness of medicine and the decline of the nation in our country, we can take this as a warning. Now that science is advancing rapidly, we must know that medicine is a noble and active construction enterprise, whose progress is related to the health of the nation, the development of social undertakings, and the advancement of national construction. All Chinese people should be aware of this.</p>
<p>Prevention is better than cure: As the saying goes, "The best doctor treats the disease before it appears." Today, medicine is not omnipotent, so prevention is better than cure. Since the invention of smallpox vaccination in modern times, its benefits to mankind have been immeasurable. Therefore, there are special departments in the country, such as how to promote epidemic prevention and tuberculosis prevention work, popularize public health movements, and implement mandatory health examinations. On a small scale, this relates to the health and happiness of individuals; on a large scale, it relates to the public safety of the entire society. Therefore, the medicine of tomorrow belongs to preventive medicine. It is not a matter of eliminating all diseases with a single prescription. It must be understood that there is no such easy task in the world. The so-called treatment is only a part of the work in medicine. Our greatest goal is to suppress the occurrence of diseases, and the minimum limit is early diagnosis. If diseases are treated before they are discovered, then it can be done with half the effort and twice the result. For example, in the case of lung disease, which is most prevalent in our country, if X-ray examinations can be carried out early, then diagnosis can be made in the early stages, and a cure is certain. Not only can individuals obtain health early, but also how much social and economic strength can be increased! Therefore, preventing diseases is the highest peak in our ideal. Treating diseases after they have occurred is the last resort. This is another thing that we should all work together on.</p>
<p>Medicine for public enjoyment: Modern medicine, being the general link to improve the nation, relates to the rise and fall of a country, and its importance is so great. However, the nobility of all specialized medical facilities is beyond the ability of the general public to bear. Therefore, if we want to seek the progress of medicine and ensure that the public has medical security, we must concentrate great economic power. Then "medical insurance" is the only option. An extremely close cooperative organization is established between the People's Government and medical institutions, so that the public can enjoy noble medical facilities. Not only can the people obtain accurate diagnosis and treatment, but the giant wheel of medicine can also move forward continuously, developing and expanding it with economic strength, benefiting mankind, and changing the nation. Everything depends on this.</p>
<p>Now that international winds and clouds are becoming increasingly urgent, and the public rules of natural selection cannot be escaped, our glorious Chinese nation has a cultural and glorious history of more than four thousand years. If we do not make plans for it now, then even if the country does not perish, our ethnic group will perish. If we want to reverse the situation, we must improve medicine and understand the position of medicine. Alas! War is everywhere, and the situation is unpredictable. All Chinese people must encourage each other.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Winter Health in Indoor Living: Paying Attention to Rooms and Practicing Cold Resistance <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Hu</p>
<p>As winter approaches, people often use stoves, electric heaters, and radiator equipment indoors for warmth because they are afraid of the cold. In today's time of expensive coal, electricity, and firewood, the huge cost is an economic problem, which will be set aside for the moment. Even in terms of hygiene, it is not really suitable. Those who are accustomed to warmth will inevitably weaken their ability to withstand cold. If they go to a colder place, they are easily susceptible to colds. Moreover, if the room is too warm, it often makes people feel dizzy and unable to concentrate on brain work.</p>
<p>In fact, the human body itself is like a small stove, continuously emitting warmth, acting as a heat source, just like a small stove. However, its warmth is difficult to perceive by oneself and must be felt by touching another person's body. For example, if many people share a quilt, they can obtain considerable warmth. Therefore, the poor inadvertently receive natural blessings. Babies and their mothers also act as natural hot water bottles for each other, forming a chain of love. If many people gather in a small room, even without a stove, it will feel considerably warmer. Because of this relationship, if many people live together in a room, even without a warm room method, they will never feel that the cold is frightening.</p>
<p>Although the general warm room method can weaken people's resistance to cold, making them susceptible to colds, or cause dizziness and reduce work efficiency due to the room being too warm, these are not the most harmful to the human body. The most harmful to the human body is the poor ventilation method, that is, sealing the room tightly, isolating it from fresh air from outdoors, and making people live in poor air. If electric heaters, stoves, and radiators can add a device to directly warm and send fresh outdoor air into the room, it can become an ideal ventilation warm room method and make up for its shortcomings. Moreover, even if the ventilation of electric heaters and radiators is slightly poor, it will not cause people to be poisoned. The worst thing is to use smokeless white coal stoves, gas stoves, or kerosene stoves without chimneys in a tightly sealed room, which is most likely to cause people to be poisoned and endanger their lives. If you suffer from poisoning for the sake of warmth, then what is the point of seeking warmth?</p>
<p>The above-mentioned ventilation warm room method is for those who cannot avoid warm rooms and need to make up for their hygienic shortcomings. As for ordinary families, I believe that all warm room methods can be avoided. This not only saves money but is also very beneficial to hygiene. Every winter, when there is sunlight, open the windows wide and let the sunlight enter, exposing oneself to it, and one will feel warmth throughout the body. This is a natural and free method of heating. Even when there is no sunlight, the windows should not be closed. If you really feel cold, just add clothes to resist the cold. At night, keep the windows open as usual. However, close one or two of the windows where the wind can blow directly onto the bed. By doing this for decades, the skin will become accustomed to the cold. Every winter, not only will there be no sign of shivering, but there will also be very few colds. I dare to share what I have learned from experience with readers, hoping to contribute to winter indoor hygiene.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Winter Epidemic Diseases and Their Prevention <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Tai</p>
<p>Among the epidemic diseases that are easy to contract in winter, respiratory diseases are the most common, because the temperature is low and the air is dry in winter. The following is a brief description of various epidemic diseases that are easy to contract in winter.</p>
<p>Nasal Catarrh: This is caused by the cold acting on the nasal mucosa, causing local anemia, and then the bacteria that are usually attached to that area take the opportunity to cause the disease.</p>
<p>Laryngitis: When suffering from this disease, the throat has various abnormal sensations such as dryness, itching, burning pain, etc. There is a unique cough like a dog's bark, and the voice also becomes hoarse. In mild cases, the voice only changes slightly, while in severe cases, the voice is hoarse like a mute, or there is no fever, or the fever is not high.</p>
<p>Tracheobronchitis Catarrh: Most cases start with a cold, and then develop this disease. The main symptom is coughing. At the beginning of the illness, there is a stubborn dry cough, sometimes with chest pain, which is called a dry cough. As the disease progresses, this cough gradually disappears, and the throat gradually has phlegm and wheezing, and the sputum gradually increases, which is called a warm cough. Coughing is an action to cough out the sputum secreted by tracheobronchitis catarrh, so forcing the doctor to stop the cough with medicine is actually a wrong request.</p>
<p>Pneumonia: Pneumonia is a serious disease, and there are two types: catarrhal pneumonia and croupous pneumonia. Both have high fever, cough, sputum, shortness of breath, chest pain, etc., which are difficult for ordinary people to distinguish. However, if you see a sudden onset with high fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath, and cough up rusty sputum, you can consider it croupous pneumonia. This disease can affect both adults and children and is a disease that directly invades the lung tissue. On the other hand, catarrhal pneumonia is caused by tracheobronchitis catarrh, and its inflammation gradually progresses to the deeper parts and eventually invades the lung tissue, thus causing pneumonia. This is generally a disease of children or the elderly, and it is less common in adults.</p>
<p>Diphtheria: This is caused by diphtheria bacteria adhering to the throat, gradually multiplying, and producing white spots. The toxins produced in that area spread throughout the body through the bloodstream, causing fever. This disease requires injection of serum, and the earlier the injection, the more effective it is.</p>
<p>Whooping Cough: Caused by whooping cough bacteria, it is a disease of children, and many children under three years of age suffer from it. Once you have it, you get immunity, but there are exceptions, and some people get it again. The cough of this disease has its own unique characteristic: after a series of countless short coughs, there is a long, audible inhalation.</p>
<p>Influenza: The cold acts on the human body, reducing its resistance, and the bacteria that previously occupied the respiratory mucosa take this opportunity to suddenly cause the disease, which is a cold. Influenza, commonly known as a severe cold, is more serious than a common cold. It is transmitted by "influenza bacteria" and is a highly contagious disease.</p>
<p>To prevent the above diseases, you should do appropriate exercises at ordinary times, strengthen your physique, and take foods rich in nutrition and various vitamins to strengthen your body and increase its resistance to diseases. You should also pay attention to implementing general hygiene methods. You should avoid going to places where many people are crowded, and it is not advisable to stay in places that are too warm or too cold for too long. If the disease is at its peak, you can wear a mask when going out to avoid infection. If you want to prevent diphtheria, you can perform preventive injections to ensure safety. As for those who are already sick, they should seek medical treatment immediately and avoid procrastination, so as not to bring trouble upon themselves.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Talking About Winter Food Supplements <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Zhaoping</p>
<p>Among foods and drinks, such as milk, eggs, cod liver oil, animal liver, etc., they can all be regarded as supplements in winter.</p>
<p>Milk contains protein, fat, lactose, lecithin, phosphorus, calcium, iron, and important enzymes. Its quality can be called the best among foods and drinks. Drinking more high-quality milk can make weight gain very quickly.</p>
<p>Eggs, eating two medium-sized ones every day, each weighing fifty grams, can fully supplement the protein needed by the human body—protein is the main nutrient in the human body. Moreover, the yolk is rich in Vitamin D. Children eating one or two a day can prevent rickets and promote development, so eggs can be regarded as a special gift for children's winter supplementation.</p>
<p>Cod liver oil contains Vitamin A and Vitamin D. Halibut liver oil contains the most Vitamin D, one hundred to one hundred and twenty-five times more than cod liver oil. Its efficacy is similar to that of yolk. Winter is the best time to take cod liver oil. Taking an appropriate amount of cod liver oil every day can not only prevent night blindness, dry eye, and corneal softening, but also strengthen the body and enhance its resistance to infectious diseases. It is most effective for children to take it, as they easily develop and grow up.</p>
<p>Among animal livers, calf liver is the top-grade hematopoietic agent, and it is also rich in vitamins, so if you want to replenish blood in winter, you may wish to eat more liver foods.</p>
<p>However, in the current high-cost living environment, the above-mentioned foods and drinks are relatively expensive. Except for the general bourgeoisie who can afford to enjoy them, the remaining salary earners and the proletariat cannot afford them. However, it is not difficult for poor people to supplement their bodies in winter. No matter how poor they are, they cannot do without eating. So, starting from winter, first change from eating white rice to brown rice. Brown rice not only contains anti-beriberi vitamin B, but also contains development-promoting vitamins. It is truly a great supplement for the poor. Moreover, the price is somewhat cheaper than white rice, which is also an economical method.</p>
<p>In terms of drinks and foods, although poor people cannot afford milk, they can replace it with soy milk and soy foods. Germans are regarding soybeans as milk!</p>
<p>As for side dishes, such as the existing cabbage, spinach, and other vegetables containing chlorophyll, they all contain rich iron, which can replenish blood. Therefore, using the above-mentioned vegetables as daily side dishes is not only cheaper but also provides the effect of replenishing blood naturally.</p>
<p>If people with weak economic strength can follow the above methods as a guide for drinks and foods, then seeking supplements from food can be called economical and beneficial!</p>
<p>Finally, I would also like to add that the purpose of seeking supplements is to improve health, so just eat foods that are needed for health to meet the purpose of supplementing. If you kill chickens and ducks! Eat large amounts of fish and meat, thinking that you cannot supplement without doing so, then it can only be regarded as indulging in sensual pleasures. Even if you eat until your brain is full and your intestines are fat, it will cause too much fat to accumulate in the body, which is not only useless but also harmful, and deeply violates the true meaning of food supplements!</p>
<p>Happy Food Malt Extract Sells Well The Happy Food Malt Extract issued by the Jiufu Pharmaceutical Company on Baker Road in this city is a nourishing beverage created domestically. After taking it, it can exert its nourishing ability in a short period of time, exerting its effects of nourishing the body, replenishing blood, nourishing the brain, and strengthening the marrow. Many sanatoriums in this city have adopted it as a daily tonic beverage for hospitalized patients. Its reputation is evident. The company has decided to issue a special issue in this newspaper on December 8 to commemorate the third anniversary of the issuance of Happy Food Malt Extract, so as to inform readers from all walks of life. In addition, there are also newly produced Happy Food Nourishing Biscuits, which contain various vitamins and are rich in nutrition. They have the functions of assisting digestion and promoting appetite, and are delicious and crispy. They are most suitable for children with incomplete development and those who are out of balance after illness or childbirth.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Supplementation Should Go Hand-in-Hand with Exercise <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Zha Rui Long</p>
<p>Because, on the surface, supplementation and exercise seem like two unrelated matters, people who pay attention to exercise often mistakenly believe that supplementation is unnecessary, while those who take supplements often believe that medicine is all-powerful and do not pay attention to exercise.</p>
<p>In fact, the human body is like a machine. If a machine is not used, it will rust. Therefore, only taking supplements without exercise will at most create a fat body and a waddling gait, and will never make the physique strong and robust. If one only engages in exercise without knowing about nutritional replenishment, the result will be like a machine that has been used for a long time without being oiled or inspected and repaired. It will inevitably be easily worn out and eventually become unusable.</p>
<p>The author has maintained a strong physique for the past twenty years and has never been troubled by illness. I believe this is due to exercise, but also to nutrition. Initially, I also worked hard at exercise, but diseases grew rampantly and I remained weak. Later, under the guidance of martial arts seniors, I paid attention to nutrition on the one hand and devoted myself to exercise on the other, taking both into account and never interrupting either. My stubborn body gradually became stronger. Therefore, I know that supplementation and exercise are mutually reinforcing and should not be neglected. I hope that people who love exercise will also pay attention to body nutrition. And I hope that people who take supplements will pay attention to exercise, especially simple exercises that are easy and accessible to everyone... the first six forms of New Combat... should also be given considerable importance, because New Combat is a body-strengthening technique that does not cost time or money. It is very simple and effective to practice, so just a dozen minutes of practice each day is enough.</p>

<p>The health and longevity of our bodies largely depend on the strength of important organs, such as the various endocrine glands, heart, vascular system, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Mental depression and anxiety will also reduce lifespan, so it is essential to be optimistic in all things and to have adequate entertainment and rest, which can bring mental happiness. As for other lifestyle habits, they must be in line with hygiene in order to maintain the strength of various important organs. When a person is old, they should pay even more attention to self-care in order to enjoy longevity. Now, the hygiene of clothing, food, housing, and transportation will be discussed separately below.</p>
<p>Clothing: The clothing of the elderly should be light and warm. The material can be wool or silk. The cut of the clothes should be wider. Underwear should be made of cotton and should be changed and washed frequently. Cotton quilts should be sunned often. Because the elderly are not very active, their hands and feet are often cold, so they should pay attention to keeping warm.</p>
<p>Diet: Hands should be washed before eating. Meals should be frequent and small, not infrequent and large. Every day when the stomach is empty, eat a bowl of thin rice porridge (fragrant rice is even better), which can promote metabolism, generate fluids, and quickly soothe the stomach. The benefits are not small. The most suitable foods for the elderly are milk, soy milk, butter, eggs, brown rice, green vegetables, oranges, bananas, apples, grapes, tomatoes, and pure cod liver oil. When eating, one must chew slowly and take more time, and not swallow quickly. It is best to cut the food into small pieces or cook it until it is soft so that it requires less chewing. If there is a little residue left between the teeth after eating, which is most tiring for the teeth, it should be picked out with a toothpick, and then strong tea should be brewed, cooled, and used as a mouthwash to rinse it out. Brushing teeth in the morning and evening is most beneficial. It is best to drink warm liquids, not cold ones. It is also good to drink soup during meals. If the elderly like to smoke and drink alcohol, a little is fine, but it is best not to consume them. Strong cigars are harmful to the heart and should not be smoked. This also applies to young people.</p>
<p>Daily life: The elderly are most prone to fatigue, so there should be a recliner in the room for them to lie down at any time. If one feels sleepy, one might as well sleep right away, which can allow the body to get complete rest. It is most beneficial to take a nap after meals. A good night's sleep is most essential. If one has trouble sleeping, one should eliminate all worries and plans when going to bed. Gradually eliminate them, less and less, until there are none. Then one will naturally sleep soundly. The elderly's bedroom should be in a quiet place and should be warm in winter and cool in summer. The windows should be opened frequently. The size of the open window should be inversely proportional to the strength of the wind, the heat and cold of the weather. It is also best to maintain a room temperature of 64-65 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<p>Exercise: Although the muscles of the elderly have weakened, they should still have adequate exercise. Brisk walking is the most suitable exercise for the elderly. Going out for a walk at a set time every day is extremely beneficial to health. It can make one feel refreshed, increase appetite, promote bowel movements, and allow one to sleep soundly at night. Sometimes, if one cannot go for a walk to a farther place, walking several thousand steps in the house or behind the house is also very beneficial. Walking should be relaxed and unconstrained, walking and standing, standing and walking, with an attitude of leisure and ease.</p>
<p>Diseases: Common diseases for the elderly over the age of fifty include stroke (cerebral hemorrhage), chronic nephritis, and cancer. The first two diseases are mostly caused by eating too much meat and alcohol when young, leading to high blood pressure and hardening of the blood vessels. The remedy is to practice deep breathing, eat more fruits and vegetables, and abstain from meat. Blood pressure will naturally decrease, and the incidence of nephritis will also decrease. Those suffering from nephritis should further reduce salt intake, or even eat only fruits and vegetables. If one can persevere, one can prevent stroke and chronic nephritis, and it will not be difficult to gradually recover. However, there is still no cure for cancer.</p>
<p>Other: The elderly should eat more fruits and vegetables to keep their bowels moving, or have a set amount of exercise each day to regulate them. Sometimes, if suffering from constipation, an enema can also be used to relieve it. If accumulated feces in the intestines are not eliminated daily, one will suffer from fecal intoxication, and the blood vessels will harden even more. Therefore, Baopuzi said, "To achieve longevity, the intestines should be clear; to achieve immortality, the intestines should be without residue."</p>
<p>On bright sunny days, the elderly should spend several hours in the sun, which can improve blood circulation and promote metabolism. The method is to first take off the upper clothing, wipe the body clean with a wet towel, and then bask in the sun, but the head should be covered. This method can also be done in winter.</p>
<p>The elderly are prone to spiritual exhaustion, so they are easily angered by everything. When one becomes angry, all kinds of internal and external secretory glands stop secreting fluids, so it is most harmful to the body. Therefore, one should deal with things with patience. If one cannot see through human affairs and the ways of the world, and one cares too much about things, one will become angry. Anger does no harm to others, but only harms oneself. Or, if one cannot let go of wealth and property, one will worry about it all day long, which is extremely tiring. One does not know that there are few days left, and although one accumulates gold and jade, what use will they be? In short, all fame, wealth, fields, real estate, calligraphy, famous paintings, love, resentment, and hatred should be let go. One should only diligently cultivate the six perfections: generosity, morality, patience, effort, meditation, and wisdom. This is what is meant by "what can be kept and what can be taken away."</p>
<h3 id="e100">Phlegm and Nasal Discharge <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Chang</p>
<p>Winter Cleaning Campaign</p>
<p>One of the worst habits of the Chinese people is spitting phlegm and blowing their noses everywhere, especially in public places. We can often see walls and corners covered in phlegm and nasal discharge, which is a very conspicuous thing.</p>
<p>Phlegm and nasal discharge are both secretions of a disease. This is not a big deal, but in general open-type lung disease patients, one does not know how many tubercle bacilli are contained in a single mouthful of phlegm. If one spits everywhere, then the seeds of tuberculosis that they spread, making it difficult for people to defend against, are in effect engaging in widespread indirect killing. Its danger is actually more dangerous and terrifying than a tangible bomb!</p>
<p>Especially in winter, because the temperature is low and the air is dry, phlegm and nasal discharge dry instantly after landing on the ground and are carried by dust. The tubercle bacilli contained within take the air as a means of invasion. Its invasion of the human body is probably faster than the modern war's most powerful blitzkrieg tactics. This is how serious a threat it is to public health, it is simply unimaginable and indescribable.</p>
<p>Therefore, when winter comes, we sincerely ask friends who have a lot of phlegm and nasal discharge to always carry one or two large handkerchiefs when going out, so that phlegm can be spat into the handkerchief, and when there is nasal discharge or sneezing, the handkerchief can be used to cover the nose. This is not only a public virtue, but also a way to carry out a campaign to clean up phlegm and nasal discharge in winter, which is also a great deed for public health!</p>
<p>Supplementation Experiences: In the past two or three years, new supplements have emerged like a whirlwind. Based on the author's experience, the only one that truly deserves to be called outstanding in terms of "quality," "quantity," and "effectiveness" is "Shou Er Kang." Since I started taking this medicine, my body has become stronger and stronger, and I feel energetic and happy all day long. All kinds of aging phenomena in the past have now been swept away. As the saying goes, "experience often exceeds knowledge." Based on my personal experience, I will introduce it without avoiding suspicion, acting as an experienced guide for those who are taking supplements. (Hua)</p>
<p>A word for those taking cod liver oil essence: Halivita cod liver oil essence (available in capsule and drop form) contains one hundred times more Vitamin D than cod liver oil. It is carefully manufactured by Hans Pharmaceutical Company, a specialist in cod liver oil products in the United States (Health Products Corp., Newark, N.J. U.S.A.). The scale of the factory is huge and is rare even in the United States. Its biochemical laboratory is larger than any American medical university or hospital. The cod liver oil warehouse often stores more than 77,000 tons. In terms of refining technology, in addition to hiring first-class pharmacists and technicians, it also employs government medical experts and professors from various medical universities as permanent consultants, and raises more than 2,000 mice and 1,500 chickens for biological experiments. The refining process takes more than two years before it is sold in the market, which shows the excellence of its products and the accuracy of its ingredients. Halivita has been verified by the US government to contain 60,000 US units of Vitamin A and 1,000 US units of Vitamin D per cubic centimeter. The Vitamin D content of the drops is richer than that of the capsules, containing 60,000 US units of Vitamin A and 6,000 US units of Vitamin D per cubic centimeter, which is especially suitable for children, pregnant women, and lactating women.</p>
