<h3 id="c14">桂南大勝在軍事上的意義 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>今日中日戰局的重心，仍在桂南，日本以全力赴之者爲桂南，中國以重兵防守者，亦爲桂南。其他如日本的偷渡錢塘江，進窺蕭山，如日軍的自五原進攻臨河，再等而下之，如自福建沿海利用匪偽進窺東山，及在山東半島登陸，進窺文登，放棄了中心而窺伺邊陲，其作用無他，不過希望掩飾其軍事上的失利轉換其國內的視綫而已，牽制中國的兵力，以便用集中的力量進擊牠的主要目的地而已。以上數路勝則無關全局的得失，敗則多所損折。以少數的兵力，冒險前進，徼倖圖逞，其失敗之局，不待蓍卜而早可預料。果然，進窺浙束的日軍，膠着於蕭山一綫而無所進展，進窺臨河的日軍，現已敗退至五原，且有續退包頭之勢，其他匪偽零星小股的蠢動，也易爲華軍擊潰，自屬意中事。此在全盤戰局上不起決定作用而不爲雙方所集中兵力以爭者。</p>
<p>自日軍得逞桂南，中國軍隊。反攻南寗，雙方大軍遂開始主力戰。日軍於去年十一月中旬自欽防登陸，越過十萬大山，侵入桂境，攻下了南寗，日軍獲得了一個重要的據點，如何鞏固南寗外圍，以爲久據之備，自然成爲日軍那時期的重要任務，所以日軍一攻下了南寗，就分兵兩路，沿邕賓邕武兩路進窺，雖日軍的目的，不但要攻佔崑崙關，據險而守，並且圖由賓陽趨柳州桂林，遙與粵北的日軍呼應，更由南寗趨永淳貴縣鬱林，俾打通西江路綫，與西江的巳軍會合，這樣一來，粵束粵西可以貫通，運輸軍火給養，乃得暢行無阻，不致專賴一條時受華方游擊隊威脅的邕欽公路，作爲主要交通運輸路綫。而日軍也可以源源開入桂南，以與華軍主力對壘，以逸待勞，擊潰華軍，而收速戰速決的效果。可是力不從心，邕欽公路，因爲遭受了華方的澈底破壞，日軍雖加緊趕修，武裝通車，並沒有能迅速達到鞏固南寗外圍外的目的，一度佔領的崑崙關要隘，也爲華方克復。經過崑崙關慘敗後，在二月初，日軍大事增援，自稱有四萬人，實際恐不止　數，（據華方估計的有十萬之衆）一路迂迴永淳平原地帶，直撲賓陽，並一度竄至賓陽西北的上林，另一路迫近武鳴近郊，華方以大軍挺進至日本後方，將日軍聯絡寸寸切斷，日軍遂全部崩潰，倉皇退走，在這一戰中，日軍被華軍殲滅者，達兩萬人以上，華軍今已進抵南寗城下，該城日軍雖作困獸之鬥，勢難久持。</p>
<p>當然日軍佔領下的南寗，旣作爲它進攻西南的根據地，在軍事上，甚關重要，它必然要死守，決不會輕易放棄的，而在中國全面反攻的時期還沒有到來的時期，不惜犧牲，攻下了一個死城，並沒有什麼重要的意義。不過由於日軍在賓武兩地輕進的失敗，第一至少使人可以感覺日軍打通湘桂而趨昆明重慶的計劃，完全是一個夢想。第二日人的進攻桂南，我們應該知道不純粹是軍事作用，而政治外交作用，猶居軍事作用之上。日本明知道以四個師團的兵力，作軍事上的仰攻，而通過桂滇等多山地帶，以達到殲滅華軍主力的目的，那無異緣木求魚，不能償願的，但日軍仍圖在桂南冒險一逞者，乃是妄想促「中國考慮和平」，這在蔣委員長重申抗戰演說中，已有肯定的答覆，證明日本的詭謀又落了空。第三日軍在桂南戰後，妄想以逸待勞，「殲滅」華軍，他們覺得華軍「有殲滅的可能」，於是深覺沒有與華軍作主力戰的機會而抱遺憾，所以這决在桂南戰爭中碰着未有的遭遇戰而深致慶幸，可是這决戰爭日軍死亡達一師團以上，證明日軍理想中的殲滅戰，消滅華軍實力的企圖，也完全是幻想。</p>
<p>現在日軍進窺賓武兩路的企圖，業已失敗，大明山脈（崑崙關一帶）已在華軍的控制中，最便於日軍重武器及機械化部進攻的地帶，自爲西向龍州及東向永淳的兩平原地帶。而打通西江一綫，允爲日人理想中的企圖，這决日軍迂迴永淳進窺賓陽，已露其端倪，如果華方扼住了這一咽喉；則日軍北向不能與華軍爭地利，南向不能與華軍爭交通綫；那末就使守住了南寗，也必坐以待斃了。</p>
<p>湘北的大敗，鄂北的挫衂，和這决桂南的崩潰，其誤都在輕進輕退，犯軍事上的大忌。日軍將領一再甘蹈覆轍，並非完全由於他們的顢預，其主要原因乃在師老於外，民怨於內，議會與政府不和，政府與軍部齟齬，這種局面，實屬非常危險，所以日軍司令遂飢不擇食，渴不擇飲，而不惜冒險，以圖還戰速決，這是可以華南日軍司令部在此决戰敗後以無綫電向桂南華軍前敵將領發出的通告中勸華軍一放棄攻勢，追求和平」證明的。</p>

<p>日人以反英運動、激動中國民衆、旣吿失敗、乃開始反對猶太人、而稱猶太人爲「東亞新秩序」之最大阻礙者、新民報之日人編輯、絕未因中國僅有少數猶太難民一事而更變其主張、但彼明瞭將日本在大陸所遇困難、歸罪於少數旅華猶太人、似難令人置信、故擴展</p>
<p>反猶運動</p>

<p>美國蘇聯</p>
<p>等國談判、俾剷除猶太人勢力、而使英美法三國斷絕與蔣介石往來、於進行談判時、應愼防猶太人之陰謀云、另一社評、題名「新秩序與美國」、其言有曰、「首相米內與外相有田、旣已闡明日本之立塲、今須待美國採取改善對日關係之步驟、惟美國之猶太資本家極有力量、苟非鎭壓猶太人勢力、則將來美日會議不能成功」、上月間、靑島舉行毫無結果之會議時、新民報社評促請與會者特別注意於影響新秩序之猶太人問題、其言曰「經密切研究所悉、</p>
<p>中國事變</p>
<p>之起因、厥爲英美法蘇四國內之猶太人勢力、欲求根本解決中國事變、吾人應擊潰在華之猶太人勢力、靑島會議對此問題「應加嚴重考慮、」本月七日、新民報歡送「華字報紙代表赴日之社評又稱、今日報紙之腐敗與偏袒、乃「猶太人勢力」所造成、向以自由與公正聞名之民治國新聞機關、即路透社·哈瓦斯社·合眾社·與塔斯社、均在</p>

<p>之勢力下、受其統制、而成猶太富翁之喉舌、此等通訊社之期刋與報紙亦然、被英美法蘇利用爲宣傳利器、民治國報紙謀造成戰爭、庶其猶太主人可乘機獲利、舉凡歐戰西班牙內戰、掩克被併、與中國事件、無一非猶太財閥所促成、而世界切紛擾、皆因猶太勢力而發生云、</p>

<p>米商違法處拘役</p>
<p>自租界當局規定國米限價、秈米不得超過三十三元、粳米不得超過四十元後、並派探員駐塲監視交易、嚴禁逾越限價交易、乃十七日有米業掮客海寗人杜洪壽（住薩坡賽路慶和里二一七號）、及福建路四六七號豐盛米號經理浦東人瞿百臻（住新菜市路十號）、因超越限價交易、為工部局政治部華探目張英梅·探員茅國寶·</p>
<p>予以拘捕</p>
<p>茲記經過於下、（一）十七日上午十時卅分、有米業掮客杜洪壽手持粳米樣子一包、前往福州路五一五號青蓮閣茶樓米市塲兜售、當經市塲管理員殷裕章詢其售價、杜開價每石為五十三元五角、事為探所聞、以杜所開價格、違反法令、超越限價、遂予拘捕、（二）工部局政治部探悉福建路四六七號</p>

<p>所出售白米、有超越限價情事、爰於十五日飭職員許忠愼·苦力吳長春·前往購得二號白米三元、量之僅得九市斤五四五、以每石合計、則價須達五十元、遂向特一法院請出拘票、將該號經理瞿百臻拘捕、昨晨一併解送特一法院刑九庭、捕房律師厲志山陳明經過、依違警罰法第三十三條</p>

<p>昨晚七時許、公共租界五馬路中央大旅社二二八號突發生暗殺案、被槍擊者為旅滬多年之河南人陸雨亭、計身中三槍、旋即車送醫院、不及救治身死、兇手當被逸去、各情如次</p>

<p>陸雨亭、河南沈邱縣東北韓莊人、年四十一歲、曾在石路四馬路開設東興樓菜館、後經收歇、平時交游甚眾、曾投已故陸連奎門下、頗受其寵信、近來復常出入滬西一帶、致頗為人所注目、故一般咸以此案發生、或係具有政治性事件耳、</p>
<p>突來三漢出槍轟擊</p>
<p>昨晚六時三刻、陸雨亭循例在其中央旅社二二八號處理事務、同時陸並曾預約另一陸姓者在房間內晚餐、其時突有衣西裝者兩人、中裝者一人、均穿馬褲呢大衣、逕行登樓、在二樓堂口徬徨良久、適該處茶役赴他處泡水、三壯漢乃闖入陸之住處、時陸正徘徊室中、三裝漢見陸、即出槍轟擊、</p>
<p>身中三彈兇手逸去</p>
<p>陸見來者袖出兇器、亟欲躲避、然一彈飛來、已擊中陸之頭部額角上、第二彈復擊中胸部、壯漢嗣後發一槍、中槍之腰部、當塲血流如注、猝然倒臥、兇手見目的已達、即悄然出門、其時附近各號房間住客、突聞槍聲、均頗疑懼、僅聞有人口呼盜刦、遂亦未敢探問、兇手始獲于此一霎那間下樓、雜人叢中逸去、</p>
<p>傷在要害不治殞命</p>
<p>該社茶役當即入二二八號房間探視、瞥見陸已倒臥血泊中、當即報告捕房、嗣經老閘捕房西捕一三七號及華探劉俊卿等多人到塲、當將傷者陸雨亭由救護送車送仁濟醫院救治、卒以傷在要害、無法施救、於七時一刻身死、</p>
<p>死者屍體今日成殮</p>
<p>陸庽店雲南路育仁里十九號宏德醫院樓上、有弟名蘭亭、妻陸許氏、子炳生、年六歲、養女淑英·淑貞、均尙待字未嫁、陸平時為與各方交往便利計、故在中央旅社二二八號開長房間、昨晚遭槍擊後其妻子聞訊、即馳往探問、見陸週身流血、痛哭良久、旋即赴醫院為其料理身後、陸之屍體將于今日移往昌平路大眾殯儀館入殮、</p>

<p>不可終日、全市生活之感受壓迫、殆無如今日之甚者、究其原因、如運費之昂貴、採辦之困難、浮費之增多、外匯之緊縮、皆足以助成物價高漲之原因、固不能專歸責於一方、但一部份人、利用時機、</p>
<p>專營私利</p>

<p>不無戒心</p>
<p>亦祇能悉其所有、躉批預購、以供數月消費之用、供求益失均衡、不知不覺之中、更予此曹以奇貨可居機會、故今日物價奇騰之局、自不能諉為純係時局關係、與滬人無涉、須知雙方互利、乃為有大利、目前局面、如果</p>
<p>長此演進</p>
<p>則全市居民、至少有百分之九十、將失其購買力、商業基礎、究築於多數消費者之上、如果多數民眾、咸化為涸轍待盡之鉜、旣無消費之對象購買之民眾、則囤積之物資、亦將化為凍結之僵石、此少烽人如果以為抓住機會、夢想今年之</p>
<p>黃金時代</p>
<p>尤將遠勝於去年、此種思想、實為錯誤之幻覺、必致人我同盡、墜入深淵、此本會所願發聾警瞶剴切勸告者也、當此政綱失馭、鞭長莫及之時、全賴人人有自覺之認識、庶能挽回此全市大恐慌之洛刧、掬　奉告、幸共鑒之、</p>

<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>據可靠方面的報吿，上海自從八一三以來，兒童犯罪的案件，已經增加了百份之三十（與物價的飛漲成正比例！），而這種罪案的發生，並不是因爲這些小孩生來就有犯罪的傾向，而是因爲飢餓與貧窮的逼迫所致。</p>
<p>不犯罪的習慣。他門不曉得甚麼叫做安全，惟有兩條腿的飛奔與雙眼的機警，可使他們獲得安全。他們對於慈善機關，是覺得沒有甚麼大道理了，因爲慈善家並不會帮助他們去與生活積極奮鬥。</p>
<p>在法院的紀錄裏，你可以看到十六歲的小孩，已經犯過六件案子，對於這種事實，我們這些社會的幸運兒能說甚麼話呢？</p>
<p>把這些小孩判罪，監禁，是沒有甚麼大意義的，是解決不了問題的。我們得學歐美各國，創設一個兒童法庭，由了解兒童心理的審判官，來審理這此案件，我們也得調查這些兒童犯罪的根本原因，由各人的需要而予以實際上的援助。</p>
<p>要比有效地解決兒童犯罪的問題，我們得有一個兒童法庭。</p>

<p>— 曹簽佑</p>
<p>在上海，流浪在街上的兒童，眞是數不勝數。這一羣幼稚天眞活潑的孩提，小小的年紀，就失却父母的照顧，漂泊到街上去，食無良物，衣不暖膚，可算是極慘了。更兼無人去指導敎育，使他們走上正軌，正像迷途的羔羊。他們爲着衣食的問題，常常會做出種種犯罪的行爲，如偷竊等。今日做小偷，明日就做大盜，社會人士，如不想方法去挽救他們，這一羣孩子可說就是明日社會的歹徒。最近美國政府有見於此，於是設立「美國兒童俱樂部」於紐約城。</p>
<p>美國兒童俱樂部是由一位監獄學家名培資者所主持辦理。培資先生年齡已五十五歲，從他長久管理監獄內經騐，他下了一個關於犯罪問題的結論：「監獄是不能治療犯罪的，最良好的監獄，亦不過只能使監獄中人之半數，變成良好的公民。要减小犯罪事件的發生，最良好的方法，就是去拯救一些流浪的兒童。一個孩童將來的好壞，基於他閒暇所做的工作。</p>
<p>爲了上述的原因，就創辦了這個「兒童俱樂部」；一切的設備，都是迎合着兒童們的心理，如體育館，游泳池，美術室及商店。這樣一來，兒童們在閒暇的時候，就有他們最適當的遊息之地了。</p>
<p>我希望不久的將來，在上海，也有一個這樣的「兒童俱樂部」建立起來；收容一羣流浪的兒童，敎導訓練他們，利用他們的力量，做種種對社會有利的事業。這樣一來，社會增加良好的公民，國家增加有用之才。</p>

<p>假使十年前有一個預言家對我說：你的一生是平凡的。或許從童年到現在，我不會做許多瑰麗的夢。</p>
<p>四五年前，坐在教室裏末後的一排，敎師的解講從不使我發生興趣，新的名詞被我視作糞土，終日抬着頭向窗外的天空，神往着許多奇突的故事</p>
<p>生活漸趨單調了，祇有我的遐想如滔滔的流水，我想到這個天地之外，一味在神秘中探求。</p>
<p>我不喜歡人們呼喊我的名字，我不希望他們知道我，我用半閉著的眼看這個世界，祇有孤獨來安慰我，我的歌聲也變為晦澀，生硬了！</p>
<p>於是，我變成了超人，我不多講話，祇愛靜靜地沉思。　見到別人的喜悅，我生了厭憎，我譏笑他們是低級的樂趣，我以爲世界上一切可以歡美的事，都是毫無價值的。</p>
<p>我也不願聽他人訴苦，哀泣，我說這是他們自作自受，是他們深入社會的結果。</p>
<p>將身邊的一切都化作渺小，我毫不停息地在找尋一個不存在的世界。</p>
<p>在幾個年頭中，我孑然獨走，但是人生的波瀾給我意想不到的打擊，將我的妄想，化作輕烟。</p>
<p>也因於嘗到一些苦痛的滋味，我又回到這個世界裏。</p>
<p>如今，我聽了一個詩人人的話，我要走遍流散着汚穢與腐奧的都市和足跡不至的鄉下，再不憂鬱的偏着頸子望着天空或者牆壁做夢，我所要關心的是人間的事情。</p>

<h3 id="c115">好斯上校與初次歐戰 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 李紹忠</p>
<p>美國總統羅斯輻最近派遣副國務卿威爾斯，以總統私人代表資格赴歐訪問，巳引起全世界各國當局之密切注意。各國評論家對於威爾斯此行，多拿來和上次歐戰時美國已故總統威爾遜派遣好斯上校赴歐之行，相提並論。但當年好斯上校聘歐的結果，非特未能恢復和平，反使美國捲入戰禍。這次威爾斯赴歐，有何結果，當然也很值得注意。現在讓我們把好斯上校介紹給讀者。</p>
<p>好斯上校於一八五八年七月二十六日生於美國南部德撤州厚斯敦城。他的父親幼年即自英國　，後來會參加德撒州脫離墨西哥併入北美合衆國的「獨立」革命，頗建功勳。好斯上校自幼即受良好教育，於一八七九年畢業美國著名學府「康乃爾大學」。翌年回返故鄉德撒州。自後在德撒州居住，凡三十餘年之久，以種植為業。但他主要的興趣，還在公共事務上面。在一八九四年和一九〇四年之間，他在德撒州握有很大的政治潛勢力。不過他始終一貫地拒絕自己正式踏上政治舞臺，所以他從不會做過官吏候選人。他寗以在野之身，爲本州當局做一位密切的顧問。</p>
<p>一九一二年時，他在推薦威爾遜做總統候選人的運動中，很盡過力。威爾遜結果常選，他一個人的功勞，着實不小。所以當威氏上臺時，請他自已選擇在內閣中担任任何的官職，但他仍舊保持着一貫的作風，拒絕接受任何官銜。不過無論在政治上或在私情上，他和威爾遜總統關係的密切，遠在任何內閣大員之上。就是總統選擇內閣官員時，一大部份是根據好斯上校的推薦的。並且總統和閣員們，一遇有立法上或行政上的困難，往往都要求敎於好斯，因爲好斯上校非但閱人很多，而且對政治實施的評斷，常有獨到精明的見解。戚爾遜總統說好斯是他的「獨立的我」。（Inoependent　self)</p>
<p>好斯對於外交，更有莫大的興趣。他因爲常和美國駐外大使接近，又時時親近歐洲諸大政治家，再加以威爾遜總統對他的信任，所以他對於美國外交政策決定的方針，無形中有着重大的影響。</p>
<p>一九二四年春天，歐洲第一次大戰爆發之前，他深知歐洲局勢嚴重的危險，特地起程赴歐，向英德兩國提出建議，表示美國願努力使英德關係能加以調整，藉以避免戰爭。他在柏林和德國的高級長官會談，還和德皇舉行過一次會議。後來威廉二世會說道：「好斯上校的聘問柏林和倫敦，幾可使這次世界大戰不致發生。」</p>
<p>自歐洲回美後，好斯上校一直和英德兩國大使保持着密切的接觸，這使美國在歐戰初期中和歐洲交戰國雙方的關係，都很和睦。一九一五年一月，威爾遜總統派他以總統私人代表的資格，前往歐洲，對於在當時局勢下美國有無調解戰爭可能的問題，作一番實地的研究。在訪問倫敦·柏林·和巴黎之後，好斯上校建議以「海洋自由」的原則，來作妥協的初階；但「羅司坦尼亞」號航輪的被沉，使得一切成功的希望都粉碎無餘了。第二年，好斯上校再度被派赴歐，對歐局的和平，作最後的努力。但雖有卓越的政治手腕和强大的國力巷他撑腰，而好斯上校一番「苦蓮心腸」的苦口婆心，，終於不能挽歐局的瀾於旣倒，而且美國自身也無法避免被捲進大戰的漩渦中去。</p>
<h3 id="c116">德國要人的太太 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 陸德綱</p>
<p>據說德國人對待女太太們，較任何國人都尊敬。男先生們對於自己的夫人，莫不愛護備至。這是德國人常引以自傲的一件事。</p>
<p>所以自從歐戰爆發後，航空部長戈林將軍，便請他的夫人託病往瑞士去療養。外長里賓特洛夫的太太，也應他丈夫之請，趁船往巴西去作長途放行。宣傳部長郭倍爾的太太，和牛賴斯夫人，也不約而同地跑到瑞士去作寓公。德國的秘密警察長希墨萊的夫人，在戰前，便已在意大利遊山玩水，聽說她遊興很濃，故一時不擬立即回去。</p>
<p>這些德國的要人太太們，個個都溜在國外逍遙。自然，享受男人給她們的尊敬和愛護特權。只可憐大多數的德國婦女太太們，非但享不得這種淸福，反而飽嘗着元首希特勒一手造成的戰爭，所賜與的無限苦痛！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Troops in Nanning Heavily Defeated by Chinese Army, Most Retreating to the Qin-Fang Area; Japanese Aircraft and Gasoline at Nanning Airfield Burned; Chinese Army in Hubei Recovers Pingba, Encircles Sanyangdian <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Guinan Frontline Telegram: Japanese troops fleeing south from Nanning were intercepted and attacked by the Chinese army along the way, appearing extremely disheveled. Most of the Japanese troops have now retreated to the Qin-Fang area. A strong Chinese force is currently pursuing them south. (19th Telegram)</p>
<p>Binyang: Remnants of the Japanese army in Yong are still holed up in fortifications near Santang, attempting to hold out to the death. However, within Nanning city, the Japanese are still fighting among themselves, with gunfire and explosions incessant. The fires are still raging, causing many casualties. The Japanese troop garrison in Xixiangtang, outside the city, has also been completely burned. On the 15th, the Chinese army burned all the Japanese aircraft and gasoline at the Nanning airfield. (19th Telegram)</p>
<p>Guinan Frontline: The Japanese army in Nanning city has been in a state of extreme chaos since the 15th. The large fire has not been extinguished for three days and nights. The remaining Japanese are fleeing southward in disarray. (19th Telegram)</p>
<p>Guilin: In early February, after fierce fighting in Guinan, more than 2,000 severely wounded Japanese soldiers were transported to the Qinxian reception center, but they all died completely on the 16th, 17th, and 18th, appearing to have been poisoned. Also, after the Fengxi campaign in early January, the Japanese officers and soldiers who were severely wounded and left in Chao-Shan for treatment have all died. (19th Telegram)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from here today, there are considerable differences of opinion among the Japanese commanders in Nanning regarding the withdrawal issue. Ever since the 15th, the Japanese commander in Nanning has been demanding a prior withdrawal, to escape back to Qinzhou, their original landing point. (19th Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Although there are widespread rumors that the Japanese army is currently withdrawing from Nanning, well-informed Chinese sources do not believe this to be the case. In their opinion, the Japanese army may still put up a stubborn resistance before abandoning the city. When the Japanese army retreats towards Nanning, it is expected that major fires will break out in villages northeast of the city. This is because the Japanese army also looted and burned when they invaded Binyang and Wuming earlier this month. Many places in Binyang and the entire city of Wuming have been burned to the ground. During the Japanese occupation of Binyang and Wuming, the Chinese residents who remained in the two cities suffered from a shortage of food and supplies. The Japanese army did not carry much food when they advanced north from Nanning, so when their rear supply lines were cut off by the Chinese army, food became extremely scarce. The large fire in Nanning city may have been caused by looting by the Japanese troops retreating from Binyang and Wuming to obtain food. Regarding the reported complete withdrawal of the Japanese army from Nanning to Qinzhou along the coast, the Japanese originally concentrated a large force to invade Binyang and Wuming, but the offensive failed. The entire army retreated to Nanning. However, Nanning is a small city that cannot accommodate such a large force, nor does it need such a large force for defense. Therefore, the Japanese commander may have ordered the surplus troops to retreat to the coast for rest and reorganization. For example, in a large city like Nanjing, 50,000 Chinese troops were stationed for defense two years ago, and the city already felt overcrowded. Therefore, it is natural for the Japanese commander to withdraw troops from Nanning now. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Shashi: On the morning of the 18th, the Chinese army launched an attack on Pingba, a key stronghold north of Jingba, engaging the Japanese in fierce combat. The Chinese army repeatedly charged and fought hand-to-hand. By noon, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the assault and retreated towards Anlu, abandoning more than 300 bodies. Pingba was recovered on the 9th. Subsequently, the Chinese army pursued the retreating Japanese forces in victory. One unit has already approached Luan, and another unit is attacking Sanyangdian, which has already been surrounded. The attack is ongoing. (19th Telegram)</p>
<p>Yichang: Around 8:00 AM on the 18th, a unit of the Japanese army, supported by numerous artillery pieces, launched an artillery barrage of over 400 rounds from the Shenjiang Station, via Diaojiamiao, to the east bank of the Dongjing River, attempting to cover Japanese infantry crossing the river to wreak havoc. After a fierce barrage from Chinese forces, multiple Japanese boats were sunk, and 200-300 Japanese troops were killed. The Japanese retreated in disarray. (19th Telegram)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Chinese army in Hubei has been attacking Pingba, a key stronghold between Anlu and Sanyangdian, for several consecutive days, inflicting heavy casualties. The Japanese army has been shaken. On the morning of the 18th, our forces launched a pincer attack with a strong unit, and finally recovered Pingba. The remaining Japanese forces retreated towards Anlu, and the Chinese are in pursuit. Also, a unit of the Japanese army in Heijiaji, on the Jingzhong Road, launched a fierce attack north of the village at dawn on the 17th.

Also, the Japanese army at Zaoshi, on the Hanyi Road, passed through Yonglong River to the vicinity of Zhangwan, where they were ambushed by the Chinese, resulting in more than 100 Japanese being killed and the capture of two mountain guns, machine guns, and a large amount of supplies.

<h3 id="e14">The Military Significance of the Great Victory in Guinan <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Today, the center of gravity of the Sino-Japanese war is still in Guinan. Guinan is where Japan is devoting all its efforts, and Guinan is also where China is defending with heavy troops. Other actions, such as Japan's sneak crossing of the Qiantang River to probe Xiaoshan, the Japanese army's advance from Wuyuan to attack Linhe, and even the smaller incursions, such as using bandits and puppets to probe Dongshan from the Fujian coast and landing on the Shandong Peninsula to probe Wendeng, are all abandoning the center to spy on the periphery. Their purpose is nothing more than to conceal their military setbacks, divert attention at home, and constrain Chinese forces, so that they can use concentrated forces to attack their main target. Success in the above-mentioned offensives would not affect the overall situation, while failure would result in many losses. Advancing rashly with a small number of troops, hoping for a fluke victory, is a situation whose failure can be predicted without divination. As expected, the Japanese army probing eastern Zhejiang is stuck on the Xiaoshan line without making any progress, and the Japanese army probing Linhe has now retreated to Wuyuan and is likely to continue retreating to Baotou. Other sporadic small-scale disturbances by bandits and puppets are easily defeated by the Chinese army, which is what was expected. These actions do not play a decisive role in the overall war situation and are not where both sides concentrate their forces to fight.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army succeeded in capturing Guinan, the Chinese army has counterattacked Nanning, and the main forces of both sides have begun to engage in a major battle. In mid-November of last year, the Japanese army landed from Qin-Fang, crossed the Shiwan Mountains, invaded Guangxi, and captured Nanning. The Japanese army gained an important stronghold. How to consolidate the periphery of Nanning for long-term occupation naturally became the important task of the Japanese army at that time. Therefore, after the Japanese army captured Nanning, they divided their troops into two routes, advancing along the Yong-Bin and Yong-Wu routes. Although the Japanese army's goal was not only to occupy Kunlun Pass, relying on its strategic position to defend, but also to try to advance from Binyang to Liuzhou and Guilin, remotely echoing the Japanese army in northern Guangdong, and to advance from Nanning to Yongchun, Guixian, and Yulin, so as to open up the Xijiang route and join forces with the already present army in Xijiang, so that western Guangdong and western Guangxi could be connected, and the transport of military supplies and provisions could proceed smoothly, without relying solely on the Yong-Qin highway, which was often threatened by Chinese guerrilla teams, as the main transportation route. And the Japanese army could also continuously enter Guinan to confront the main force of the Chinese army, waiting for the opportunity to defeat the Chinese army, and achieve a quick victory. However, they could not live up to what was in their hearts. The Yong-Qin highway, because it had been thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese, even though the Japanese army had accelerated repairs and armed convoys, had not been able to quickly achieve the goal of consolidating the periphery of Nanning, and the Kunlun Pass, which they had once occupied, had also been recaptured by the Chinese. After the Kunlun Pass debacle, the Japanese army greatly reinforced their forces in early February, claiming to have 40,000 men, but in reality, it was probably more than that number (the Chinese estimated it to be as many as 100,000). One route detoured through the Yongchun plain area, directly attacking Binyang, and at one point even infiltrated Shanglin, northwest of Binyang. Another route approached the suburbs of Wuming. The Chinese army advanced with a large force to the rear of the Japanese army, cutting off the Japanese communication routes. The Japanese army then collapsed completely and fled in disarray. In this battle, the Japanese army was annihilated by the Chinese army, reaching over 20,000 men. The Chinese army has now advanced to the city of Nanning. Although the Japanese army in the city is putting up a desperate fight, it is difficult to hold out for long.</p>
<p>Of course, Nanning under Japanese occupation, as its base for attacking the southwest, is of great military importance. It will inevitably defend it to the death and will not give up easily. But in the era where the Chinese overall counteroffensive has not yet arrived, at the cost of sacrifice, attacking a dead city does not have any major significance. However, due to the failure of the Japanese army's easy advance into Binyang and Wuming, first of all, at least it makes people feel that the Japanese army's plan to open up Hunan and Guangxi and head for Kunming and Chongqing is completely a dream. Secondly, we should know that the Japanese invasion of Guinan is not purely for military purposes, but the political and diplomatic roles are even more important than the military role. Japan knows very well that using the strength of four divisions for military uphill attacks and passing through the mountainous areas of Guangxi and Yunnan to achieve the purpose of annihilating the main force of the Chinese army is tantamount to seeking fish from a tree, which cannot be fulfilled. However, the Japanese army still dared to take a risk in Guinan in the hope of promoting "China's consideration of peace." This has been affirmatively answered in Chairman Chiang's re-emphasizing of the war of resistance speech, proving that Japan's conspiracy has failed again. Thirdly, after the battle in Guinan, the Japanese army妄想to "annihilate" the Chinese army after resting. They felt that the Chinese army "has the possibility of being annihilated," and then felt that they had no chance to have a main battle with the Chinese army and regretting it. So, this decisive war met an unprecedented encounter battle and were deeply pleased, but the Japanese army's ideal annihilation battle, the attempt to eliminate the strength of the Chinese army, is also completely an illusion, proven by the fact that the Japanese army died more than one division.</p>
<p>Now that the Japanese army's attempt to invade Binyang and Wuming has failed, the Daming Mountains (Kunlun Pass area) are under the control of the Chinese army, and the two plains areas that are most convenient for the Japanese army to advance with heavy weapons and mechanized units are the western Xianglong Prefecture and the eastern Xiangyong Prefecture plains. And opening up the Xijiang line is indeed the Japanese people's ideal plan. The day when the Japanese army detoured Yongchun to invade Binyang had already revealed its clues. If the Chinese side controls this throat, then the Japanese army will not be able to compete with the Chinese army for geographical advantage to the north, nor will they be able to compete with the Chinese army for transportation lines to the south; then, even if they hold Nanning, they will inevitably sit and wait for death.</p>
<p>The great defeat in northern Hunan, the frustration in northern Hubei, and the collapse in this Guinan are all mistakes caused by easy advance and easy retreat, violating major military taboos. The Japanese generals have repeatedly followed the same disastrous path, not entirely due to their 顢預, the main reason is that the teachers are old and outside, the people are resentful inside, the parliament and the government are not in harmony, and the government and the military department are at odds. This situation is very dangerous. So the Japanese commander遂饥不择食, 渴不择饮, and does not hesitate to take risks in order to expedite the return. This can be proven by the notification issued by the South China Japanese Army Headquarters by radio to the generals of the Guinan Chinese Army forward, advising the Chinese army to abandon the offensive and pursue peace after this decisive battle defeat.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Pittman Advocates Taking Retaliatory Measures Against Japan, Saying This Is a Legitimate Move to Protect Rights and Will Not Cause the Other Country to Declare War on the United States <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Washington: At yesterday's meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Chairman Pittman delivered a speech, stating that the United States can take retaliatory measures against any country that does not respect American rights without causing war. For example, regarding the disputes between the Japanese army stationed in China and American expatriates, the United States, in addition to protesting empty-handedly, must take further action. I believe that if the reason for the American protest is legitimate, then the American government's actions to protect national rights by retaliatory measures must also be legitimate and legal. This is beyond doubt. Some say that other countries may declare war on our country because of this. The US government really does not need to be concerned about such far-fetched and distant possibilities. I firmly believe that no rational government will declare war on the United States, because any country that declares war on the United States will become a belligerent in the eyes of the United States and will have to accept various consequences. In short, the United States may have the possibility of taking retaliatory measures, but it is absolutely not necessary to send a single soldier to Europe or Asia, which is what we can rest assured of, he said. Senator Ashurst of Arizona then spoke, also supporting the implementation of an embargo against Japan. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>Washington: Last night, various important senators and congressmen in the United States expressed their opinions on economic sanctions in a radio broadcast here, engaging in a debate. Chairman Pittman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has always been a champion of economic sanctions against Japan. Last night, in a radio broadcast, he stated that the United States has the legal right to take retaliatory measures against Japan in order to safeguard its rights and interests in China. Therefore, when talking about the issue of export embargoes against Japan, Pittman declared, "If the United States really wants to safeguard its rights and interests in China, it must take further action than protests." When talking about the issue of Japan waging war against the United States, Pittman said, "As of now, unless the country has gone mad, it will never declare war on the United States." Democratic Senator Hugh Wilson vigorously supported Pittman's proposal. Wilson stated that Japan would have difficulty carrying out its invasion of China without material assistance from the United States. Unfortunately, since Japan waged war against China, it has always sought its own interests, and therefore the war against China has been protracted. If American assistance were withdrawn, the Japanese war of aggression against China might have collapsed long ago. Congressman Tinkham of the House Foreign Affairs Committee believes that there is a tacit understanding between Britain and the United States to deal with Japan. This tacit understanding is based on the 1938 British-American joint management agreement of Canton Island and Enderbury Island in the South Pacific, because he asked Secretary of State Hull last year to announce the content of this tacit understanding, but Hull declined to do so before obtaining British consent, stating that he could not announce it. It can be seen that there is indeed a tacit understanding. As for the United States' abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, it is nothing more than the first step in introducing war. Republican Senator Gerald Nye said, "Speaking of the export embargo, I think the facts may not be beneficial to China, but it will inevitably arouse Japan's ill will."

<p>Washington: According to news heard here today, the Republican National Convention today approved the government's oppressive policies in the Far East. As for President Roosevelt's other foreign policies, the Republican National Convention also approved them, but some isolationists still warned the government not to allow the United States to be involved in the vortex of war with Japan. According to some government leaders, the House of Representatives' rejection of the bill to fortify Guam has weakened the possibility of the United States reaching an understanding with Japan.

<p>Hong Kong, Tokyo dispatch: A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, in response to questions from foreign reporters, stated that future developments in Japan-U.S. relations depend entirely on the attitude of the United States. Japan has exhausted every possible means to improve the current situation, and we have made the final friendly and concrete gestures. However, it is regrettable that the United States has not responded, resulting in the current state of deadlock between the two countries. When reporters inquired about the increasingly tough tone of Japanese press commentary on the United States, the spokesperson asked them not to overemphasize newspaper reports, but acknowledged that public sentiment in Japan is averse to the United States. The spokesperson stated that the strengthening of this sentiment in the Japanese press stems from the existence of a deadlock between the two countries. Recent U.S. measures such as the embargo against Japan, the fortification of Guam, and the granting of new loans to China have all attracted Japanese attention and increased Japanese animosity. However, the Japanese government still hopes to restore treaty relations with the two countries, and this policy remains unchanged. The goal is to promote friendly and good neighborly relations with the United States, which Japan considers of utmost importance. When reporters asked whether the U.S. Congress delaying discussions on the embargo against Japan could clear up the current deadlock between the two countries, the spokesperson said that even if the U.S. Congress delays discussions, Japan would still feel apprehensive. When reporters inquired about the rumored issue of France not allowing Japanese aircraft to fly over Annam to Thailand, the spokesperson stated that this was indeed the case. However, Japan-Thailand relations are very close and should not be disrupted by France's opposition. Therefore, the Japanese government is currently working with the Thai government to study technical issues so that aircraft can fly directly to Thailand. When reporters asked whether countries had lodged new protests or engaged in negotiations regarding Japanese aircraft bombing the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the spokesperson stated that the Japanese government is still considering the legal issues of the U.S.'s earlier protest and has not yet submitted a response. (Dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry, when meeting with reporters today, stated that the negotiations for a commercial treaty between the Soviet Union and Japan are currently progressing smoothly. When asked whether the treaty would be largely the same as the Soviet-German commercial treaty, the spokesperson replied that trade conditions differ, but the Soviet-Japan commercial treaty may resemble the Soviet-German commercial treaty in some respects. Regarding relations with the United States, the spokesperson said that Japan's attitude towards the United States is gradually becoming stronger due to the lack of commercial treaties and the threat of embargoes. Japan has done everything it could, and these efforts have not been rewarded, which is regrettable. Regarding the incident of the British Navy boarding the German ship Altmark in Norwegian territorial waters, Japan currently has no reaction. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: On December 18th of last year, Foreign Minister Nomura of the Abe Cabinet solemnly declared to the U.S. Ambassador to Japan that the Yangtze River would be opened within a month. The deadline of February has now passed, and the opening of the Yangtze River is still far off. Today, in the House of Representatives Budget Committee, Representative Koyama raised this issue, but the Japanese government has not been able to determine a date. Representative Koyama asked whether the opening of the Yangtze River would cause economic damage to Japan. Army Minister Hata Shunroku replied that the date of the opening of the Yangtze River must be determined by the military based on military considerations, and not based on the economic impact on Japan. However, Hata Shunroku did not specify when the river would be opened. (Associated Press dispatch of the 19th)</p>

<p>Tokyo: The test flight for direct aviation between Japan and Thailand is scheduled to take place on the 26th of this month. This aviation route will not pass over French Annam, but will bypass the peninsula's beaches, and will fly directly to Bangkok from Guangzhou, completing a continuous oversea flight. The regular Japan-Thailand aviation route, which was concluded last December, was originally scheduled to commence at the beginning of this month, but due to the authorities in Annam not allowing landings in Hanoi, this initial oversea flight plan for Japan had to be established. The aircraft to be used will be Mitsubishi's twin-engine transport aircraft, "Tachikaze." The crew will consist of Captain Matsue Katsugo, pilot Migita Kiyoshi, engineers Nagaoka Tsutomu and Ito Magoshichi, communications officer Asada Masakiyo, and Sato Nobusada, six people in total. It is scheduled to depart from Haneda Airport at 6:30 AM on the 26th for the test flight, and is expected to arrive in Bangkok at 5:00 PM on the 28th.

It is said that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Yunnan Army has been fighting on various lines in Central and Southern China. Now, the Yunnan Army continues to leave Yunnan in batches to participate in the war. Furthermore, it is well known that Yunnan has a branch of the Central Aviation School and the Central Military Academy, in addition to other military facilities. Recently, anti-aircraft guns have been transferred to Yunnan to protect the Yunnan Railway. Since these anti-aircraft guns arrived, Japanese aircraft attacking the railway have encountered fierce artillery fire. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)</p>

<p>Moscow: According to a communique from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, on the 18th, our army's offensive in the Karelian sector continued to develop successfully. Under the pressure of our army, the enemy continued to retreat, and our army advanced to the line of the Tairmonkatay River (between Lake Voksijärvi and Lake Juoksemajärvi), and occupied the Mara fortress area and town, the Summa station on the coastal railway (ten kilometers south of Viipuri), the town of Jänhannes, and the Mäkisaaraati station on the coastal railway. Thus, Soviet troops have reached the coastal area west of the Gulf of Finland north of Koivisto Island. In the two days of the 17th and 18th, our army captured 313 fortifications, including 41 artillery positions. From February 11th to the 18th, our army captured a total of 475 fortifications, including 92 fortified artillery positions. As for other aspects, there were no important developments. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets, and shot down 21 enemy aircraft in air combat. (TASS dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: A communique was released here stating that the pressure exerted by the Soviet army in Karelia has gradually weakened between the Gulf of Finland and Voksa. Yesterday there were minor local battles on the front line, and there was considerable activity in the air, but otherwise it was calm. Several Soviet tanks were destroyed. Artillery activity was normal in the Suvanto area and Taipale district. Finnish troops on the northeast coast and Lake Ladoga repelled the attacking Soviet army and captured several strong Soviet positions, capturing eight Soviet cannons, three tanks, and destroying eighty Soviet transport vehicles. 570 Soviet soldiers were left dead. There was a small battle in the Kumo area, with 130 Soviet soldiers killed. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Concerns about the Soviet army capturing Viipuri increased again last night. According to unconfirmed reports, the Soviet army is only eight kilometers away from Viipuri.

<p>Helsinki: Military figures here believe that the situation in Karelia is extremely serious, but not hopeless. The Soviet army has repeatedly attacked Finnish positions, and the Finnish army has resisted stubbornly. According to military figures, the Mannerheim Line has a feature of great military value: at any time, if forced to retreat due to excessive Soviet pressure, it will not allow important positions to fall into the hands of the Russian army. Although the Finnish army has now moved to a new line of defense, it is still making every effort to prevent the concentration of Soviet troops. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 19th)</p>

<p>Paris: News from responsible sources in Paris last night stated that Germany has formally notified Norway and Sweden that if the two countries provide Finland with any direct assistance, Germany will consider the two countries to have violated their neutrality. It is generally believed that this is the reason why Sweden refused Finland's request and would not provide military assistance. This attitude of Germany proves that any country that assists a neighboring country attacked by the Soviet Union must not only deal with the Soviet Union, but must also deal with Germany. However, newspaper opinions believe that Germany may not dare to implement this threat, as it would create another war front, which would be detrimental to Germany. Newspapers generally stated that the issue of saving Finland must be resolved by the countries of the Scandinavian Peninsula. (Reuters dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>Paris: Well-informed sources said that the reason why the Swedish government refused to provide military assistance to Finland was due to Germany's attitude. According to various sources, rumors that Germany intends to mediate between Finland and the Soviet Union are still rampant. Generally, Germany hopes that after Sweden refuses military assistance, the Finnish army's will to fight can be dissipated, so that the Finnish government can more easily accept a compromise solution. But in reality, any compromise solution that does not recognize Finland's political independence is unlikely to be considered by the Finnish government. At the same time, the Soviet government is also unwilling to abandon the puppet government it created in Finland, namely the so-called "Finnish People's Government," at this time. In this situation, Germany's hope of mediating between Finland and the Soviet Union has almost completely disappeared. (Havas dispatch of the 18th)</p>

<p>London: British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax met with the Norwegian envoy last night and resolutely demanded that Norway detain the German merchant ship Altmark. Britain raised the request because Norway had not fulfilled its responsibilities as a neutral party by holding the Altmark in Bergen and not releasing the 300 British prisoners carried by the German ship. (Associated Press dispatch of the 19th)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the case of the German auxiliary ship Altmark, Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Norwegian envoy Kerdy today and lodged a protest with him. The Foreign Office released a communique in the afternoon stating: "In view of the manner in which the Norwegian authorities treated the Altmark when it was staying in Norwegian territorial waters, the British government believes that it has not fulfilled the responsibilities of a neutral country, and therefore submits the following views to the Norwegian government: It is well known that the Altmark was in the position of an auxiliary ship when the German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee was engaged in various illegal activities. The British government has also received reliable reports that the Altmark is holding 300 to 400 British subjects, and is also aware that the ship is equipped with offensive weapons. The Norwegian government should have known about the ship's passage, and therefore should have strictly inspected it when it arrived at the port of Bergen and requested to pass through Norwegian territorial waters. The British government is eager to know the course and results of this inspection procedure. According to reports we have received, the Norwegian authorities' conduct of this procedure appears to be purely perfunctory, and therefore not a single British prisoner held on the ship was discovered. To the best of the British government's knowledge, the Norwegian government's actions have violated the obligations of a neutral country. If the Norwegian authorities had discovered these British prisoners at that time, they would have either released them or detained them pending careful consideration of how to deal with them. If so, these more than 300 British prisoners would at least not have been taken to German detention camps. Therefore, the British government has sufficient rights to express dissatisfaction with the Norwegian government's inaction, as the Norwegian government will be responsible if these prisoners are not discovered in time and are sent to Germany and mistreated. Furthermore, while awaiting a response from the Norwegian government, the British government firmly believes that it has sufficient reason to demand that the Norwegian government detain the German ship Altmark." (Havas dispatch of the 18th)</p>
<p>London: Londoners are surprised by the German claim that the Altmark is an unarmed merchant ship, as the Lloyd's Register of Shipping does not list any merchant ship named Altmark.

<h3 id="e30">Truth Newspaper Commentary: German-Soviet Economic Agreement - Further Development of German-Soviet Friendship Conforms to the Peace and Interests of All Nations <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Moscow - The Truth Newspaper recently published a commentary discussing the German-Soviet economic agreement, titled "The German-Soviet Agreement Benefits Both Countries." The newspaper stated, "On September 28, 1939, when the German-Soviet Friendship and Border Treaty was signed, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov and the German Foreign Minister exchanged documents expressing their willingness to draft a plan for exchanging German and Soviet goods. The German-Soviet economic agreement signed on February 11 this year fully conforms to the aforementioned wishes. The agreement stipulates that the Soviet Union will transport raw materials to Germany in exchange for German industrial products, which is extremely beneficial to both parties. The German-Soviet economic agreement is an important development of the various agreements concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union in 1939. This agreement fully conforms to the spirit of friendship in the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact concluded in August 1939. The trade and credit agreement signed in Berlin on August 19 was indeed an important step in promoting political and economic relations between the two countries. The purpose of signing the trade agreement at that time was to eliminate the tense political atmosphere. The agreement has achieved great success in this regard. However, because the total trade volume stipulated in the agreement failed to fully advance the friendly relations between the two countries, an economic agreement was signed on February 11 to supplement the shortcomings of the agreement. Soviet Premier Molotov said at the Fifth Extraordinary Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, 'Since the Soviet Union and Germany concluded the Non-Aggression Pact on August 23, the abnormal relations between the two countries for many years have ended. Both sides have eliminated old grievances and further established friendly relations. On September 28, the two sides established a friendly border agreement, and the friendly relations between the two sides became even closer. The Soviet people are convinced that the improvement of Soviet-German relations and the development of friendly relations between the two major nations are extremely important and will have a positive impact on the international situation. The facts of the past few months have proved this belief. What is important is that the development of German-Soviet friendship fully conforms to the peace and interests of all countries. Today, Germany has become a highly developed industrial country with great mechanical and chemical industries. However, German industry still has a great need for raw materials. The Soviet Union can indeed supply Germany with a large amount of raw materials. The richness of raw materials that we can export is no less than that of German industrial products. The Soviet Union has become a great industrial country. The strength of our industry and mechanized agriculture is not only recognized by Soviet friends, but also recognized by those who hate the Soviet Union. However, because the scope of socialist construction stipulated in the Soviet Union's Third Five-Year Plan is extremely broad, and because industry will be further developed in the future five-year plan, the Soviet Union still has a great need for industrial products. The implementation of the Soviet economic plan aims to surpass any capitalist country in economic terms. Therefore, the Soviet Union has a large need for industrial products (i.e., those manufactured in Germany). We must further develop Soviet industry and at the same time consolidate our national defense capabilities. The German-Soviet economic agreement will expand the Soviet Union's foreign trade. We should pay attention to the sharp reduction in our trade with Britain and France. Even before the outbreak of the war, Britain and France canceled Soviet orders. This behavior is also extremely detrimental to themselves. It is strange that the Soviet Union ships goods to Britain and France, but the latter refuses to exchange goods. In addition, the Paris police searched the Soviet trade agencies in a manner similar to that of bandits. This behavior is reminiscent of Jensen Hicks' search of the Soviet trade agencies in London in 1927 and eliminates all possibilities for expanding Soviet-French trade. The Soviet Union has highly developed industries and agriculture, and its economic strength is extremely great. It does not need to rely on foreign countries. The development of its trade will not be slightly stalled by the obstruction of Britain and France. The economic agreement signed on February 11 shows the possibility of developing German-Soviet trade. Currently, Germany and the Soviet Union both have a strong desire to develop trade. After the German-Soviet agreement is signed, the total trade volume between the two countries in the first year of implementation will exceed any figure since the World War, and will continue to increase in the future. This agreement is extremely important for the economies of the two major powers, Germany and the Soviet Union. In addition, it will affect international economic life and is also extremely important politically. After the German-Soviet economic agreement was concluded, newspapers in Britain, the United States, and various European countries commented on it. German newspapers of course expressed satisfaction with the agreement. Other newspapers also wrote articles unanimously, believing that this new agreement is extremely important for consolidating Soviet-German economic cooperation. In the past few months, various agreements concluded between Germany and the Soviet Union (including the Non-Aggression Pact, the Friendship and Border Treaty, and the economic agreement) have created a solid foundation for the development of economic and political relations between the two countries. The agreement is extremely in line with the interests of the German and Soviet peoples, the interests of peace, and the interests of the masses worldwide. (Tass dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e31">Japanese Minister of Colonial Affairs Plans to Expand in the South Seas - Ministry of Foreign Affairs Decides to Add a South Seas Bureau <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo - Koiso, the Minister of Colonial Affairs, is known as the most resolute figure in the Yonai Cabinet. Recently, he drafted a plan to concentrate on economically expanding influence in the South Pacific. He is now working diligently to implement it step by step, so that the "South Seas Expansion Plan" will definitely receive an important impetus in the short term. The following matters can serve as evidence: (1) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to add a South Seas Bureau. (2) The Colonial Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs has added a South Seas Section. (3) Last summer, Japan and the Pacific mandated islands (i.e., the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Marshall Islands) decided to open an air route. (4) The convenience of South Seas shipping will be improved. (5) A South Seas Shrine will be built on Palau Island (located southwest of the Philippine Islands) to enshrine the sun god. (6) A Tokyo Municipal Trade Bureau will be established in Batavia, Java, to develop commercial relations with the Dutch East Indies. (7) Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso inspected the Pacific mandated islands last month. (8) Minister of Colonial Affairs Koiso recently published a speech in various newspapers, strongly stating that the East Asian economic group should include the South Seas. (9) When the House of Representatives recently met, the majority of the members advocated expanding economic influence in the South Seas, and Foreign Minister Arita gave a favorable reply. In addition to this, there are various signs that cannot be listed in detail. What is particularly noteworthy is that the expansion of influence only refers to economic influence, not political influence. Japanese officials have repeatedly issued declarations, stating that they have no territorial ambitions and no intention of aggression. What they seek is to find new markets and new sources of raw materials in the South Pacific. As for why Japan is expanding its economic influence in the South Seas, the Pacific Affairs Research Department of the Japan International Association recently issued a statement to explain it. The content roughly stated that the Pacific Islands "should be placed under the shining light of modern culture," and the treasures of these islands should be made public. If the policy now implemented by Japan is only carried out in the Asian continent and its success is sought, it is impossible. The Pacific Ocean has a variety of resources, and its location is quite convenient, enough to assist in the success of Japanese policies. In short, good opportunities are "once in a thousand years." The Japanese people must fully utilize them. This responsibility is extremely important. (Havas dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<p>Washington - The Republican National Executive Committee recently issued a campaign platform for the general election. In terms of foreign policy, it is roughly the same as the current government's policy, that is, it advocates strict neutrality and will never participate in the European war. The government should reiterate that various treaties have a sacred and inviolable nature, as well as the U.S. government's willingness to respect international law and maintain order. In terms of national defense, it advocates implementing a national defense plan that includes the entire Western Hemisphere. In terms of domestic affairs, it declares that the current government's "New Deal" has completely failed economically, opposes government control of private enterprises, and advocates (1) implementing a separation of powers in administration, (2) reducing all federal government expenditures by 20%, (3) restoring budget equilibrium, (4) restoring the gold standard, (5) abolishing the President's powers over the currency system, (6) reducing income tax and business tax, (7) revising current commercial and agricultural policies, and (8) various current laws governing labor-management relations should be revised.

<p>Dublin - After U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced that he would hold talks with the envoys of various neutral countries in Europe to the United States, the government of the Southern Ireland Commonwealth received a note from the U.S. government, proposing this matter. Government officials believe that what U.S. President Roosevelt is working on is to find various foundations to pave the way for future peace negotiations. This is most satisfactory. As for the content of the reply to be submitted by the Republican government, officials have not yet revealed anything. According to well-informed sources, the cabinet of the Republican government has reached a consensus that it can fully agree with President Roosevelt's initiative. Chairman of the Executive Council de Valera often personally telegraphed President Roosevelt to respond. In addition, the U.S. government previously caused displeasure here when it included Ireland in the "European War Zone," but the U.S. government's decision to slightly consult the Southern Ireland Republican government shows that it has indeed recognized Ireland as a neutral country.

<p>The Hague - Regarding the appeal made to the Indian people by Lord Zetland, the British Secretary of State for India and Burma, Indian nationalist leader Gandhi published an article in the London "Times" yesterday to answer it, in which he did not spare any effort to criticize the British government's Indian policy. Gandhi declared that Zetland apparently believes that India can be controlled by Britain for a long time, and at the same time believes that London can decide India's future constitution. I ask to inform Zetland that the Indian nation has long been determined to be independent and will persevere as long as there is breath. As far as the present is concerned, there is no possibility of understanding between Britain and India, because the British government believes that the Indian constitution can be decided by British officials without the need for the Indian people to decide it.

<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Second is to assist in military service construction and respect wounded soldiers. This means that our compatriots should, on the one hand, help with military service and, on the other hand, participate in the Friends of Wounded Soldiers movement. The wounded soldiers have already fulfilled their glorious and struggling responsibilities for defending the nation and the people. Our people should give them spiritual comfort and provide as much material help as possible. The New Life Movement Headquarters has organized many Friends of Wounded Soldiers societies in various places to promote general social service for wounded and sick officers and soldiers. Now, taking the opportunity of the sixth anniversary, it is establishing a general society and launching a movement to solicit friends for wounded soldiers, aiming to attract 100,000 friends of wounded soldiers. Of course, the more, the better. I hope all compatriots will respond and participate enthusiastically, directly repaying the merits of the wounded soldiers and indirectly enhancing the morale of the men fighting on the front lines. As for the thorough completion of the military service system, it is an important matter for our nation-building and army-building. Our compatriots should assist in propaganda and promote it in various ways, so that all able-bodied young men can automatically enlist, and families and society should supervise and encourage them together. Whether it is the consolation of new recruits or the regular consolation and assistance to the families of soldiers fighting in the war, all efforts should be made to implement it universally. Third is to assist in eradicating opium and improving national health. To improve national health, we must eliminate opium passively and promote national sports actively. To achieve this goal, we have established two organizations: the National Anti-Opium Association and the National Physical Education Promotion Association. As everyone knows, this year is the last year of the six-year opium prohibition plan. The government's ban on opium will not be suspended due to the war. It has been announced repeatedly that it will be completed as scheduled, but at the same time, the people of the whole country must unite to help eliminate it, so that it can be done quickly and thoroughly. I hope that compatriots in various places will spontaneously rise up, supervise each other, encourage each other, and mobilize social forces to provide medical and economic assistance to the opium addiction treatment centers, so that opium addicts can escape from their suffering. Furthermore, we must awaken our compatriots in the occupied areas, strive for self-respect, supervise each other, and break the enemy's conspiracy to poison us. As for the popularization of national sports, it is even more urgent during this important period of war and nation-building. I hope that compatriots in various places will recognize that cultivating the national physique and strengthening the national spirit are fundamental to the revival of the nation. Whether it is mountain climbing, swimming, boxing, national martial arts, or various modern exercises to strengthen the body, all should be organized into groups and enthusiastically promoted, depending on local conditions. By encouraging ourselves and others, and strengthening our bodies and our race, we will lay a solid foundation for a strong nation. Fourth is to promote the national economy and increase wartime production. Since the war, our seaports have been harassed and blockaded by the Japanese army, and the supply of materials has been difficult. But in fact, this is an opportunity for our national economy to be reborn. What we need to pay attention to most urgently is, first, to carry out consumer cooperation to regulate our supply and demand and suppress the prices of essential goods. Second, we must thoroughly eliminate Japanese goods and strengthen the anti-blockade movement. We must absolutely not sell raw materials and goods to the Japanese, and we must absolutely not allow Japanese goods to be sold in our territory, in order to break the Japanese economic invasion plan. Third, we must increase agricultural and industrial production. Except for those who are participating in the front lines and serving in labor services, all men and women in the country should choose a production enterprise, whether it is agriculture, horticulture, road construction, transportation, or handicraft manufacturing and simple industry, and actively work to the best of their ability. We must promote various competition methods to make wartime necessities and work can be improved day by day and continuously increased. The government has set up more than 1,000 industrial cooperatives, manufacturing various necessities of food, clothing and other living things. This kind of industry, is cooperative, simple, and has a quick effect, and does not require much capital. I hope people from all walks of life will promote it accordingly, so that the power of production can penetrate into the countryside. Fourth, we must reward and encourage livestock production and enhance transportation capacity. Our rural areas have always supplemented the economy by raising domestic animals. The western provinces of the rear are naturally famous livestock areas. I hope that the provincial governments and compatriots from all over the country can encourage livestock production, not only raising chickens and pigs, but especially working hard to breed horses, cattle, sheep and other animals to greatly increase production. On the one hand, it can enrich the economy, and at the same time, it can set up vehicles to facilitate transport and enhance our wartime transportation capacity. Fifth is to awaken our women compatriots and promote the women's movement. Women compatriots account for half of the country's population, which is where half of the power of our entire nation lies. Since the war, under the promotion of the Women's Guidance Committee, our female compatriots have participated in war zone services and have achieved significant results. For example, in childcare, 48 nurseries have been established, caring for tens of thousands of refugee children. Textile experimental areas and sericulture experimental areas have been established, and new women's handicraft cooperatives of New Life Movement have been organized and wartime family factories have been established, which have made great contributions to increasing production. This is really the most gratifying phenomenon. However, strictly speaking, only a very small number of female compatriots are participating in these works. We need to increase national strength, so that the majority of women compatriots can be mobilized to work together in families and in society, improve the national life, and strengthen the work of resisting the war. Therefore, this year, we especially hope that the women's new movement can be intensified to create greater achievements. The above five tasks are all closely related to the war and nation-building. I hope that all compatriots will act with the purpose of serving the society, and exert the enthusiasm of self-help and saving the country, to practice and strive together. I often say to the people of the country (the purpose of life is to improve the lives of all mankind, and the meaning of life is to create the life that succeeds the universe). Our current life is being oppressed by the Japanese military invasion, and the life of the nation is at a critical juncture of survival. Only by intensifying the spirit of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor can we break through the current turbulent waves. We must also know that we are fully confident in the final victory of our military resistance, but to achieve military victory, overcome the current difficulties, and establish a new foundation for construction, all the people of the country must renew from their lives, strive in their work, be self-reliant and constantly strive for progress. I wish all compatriots in the country will encourage each other, work hard to move forward, and complete the mission of our times. (19th telegram)</p>

<p>A Beijing dispatch from the Continental News of February 7th stated that the New People's Daily, controlled by the Japanese, is currently conducting an anti-Semitic campaign, clearly displaying</p>
<p>Nazi characteristics</p>
<p>The Japanese failed to agitate the Chinese people through an anti-British movement, so they began to oppose Jews, claiming that Jews are the greatest obstacle to the "New Order in East Asia." The Japanese editors of the New People's Daily have not changed their position despite the fact that China has only a small number of Jewish refugees. However, they understand that it is difficult to make people believe that the difficulties Japan has encountered on the mainland are due to a small number of Jews in China, so they expanded the</p>
<p>Anti-Semitic campaign</p>
<p>And used the invisible worldwide "Jewish forces." This campaign is now limited to the editorial page of the New People's Daily. If it is expanded, it will follow the anti-British movement that is dying out. Since the Chinese people have little reason to believe that China's current difficulties are the result of the activities of the British or "Jewish forces," Chinese observers say that the chances of success of the new movement are as slim as the anti-British movement. It is learned that the New People's Daily, the most important official newspaper in North China, began the current anti-Semitic campaign when the Japanese Yonai cabinet was formed. The first editorial of the newspaper on this matter stated briefly that in order to complete the construction of the New Order in East Asia, we hope that the new Japanese Yonai cabinet will put out Jewish forces in order to defeat the "Chiang regime." To achieve this goal, we hope that the Japanese cabinet will begin negotiations with</p>
<p>The United States and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>and other countries, in order to eradicate Jewish forces and cut off the relationship between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France and Chiang Kai-shek. During the negotiations, they should be careful to prevent Jewish conspiracies. Another editorial, entitled "The New Order and the United States," stated, "Prime Minister Yonai and Foreign Minister Arita have already clarified Japan's position. Now it is up to the United States to take steps to improve relations with Japan. However, Jewish capitalists in the United States are very powerful. If Jewish forces are not suppressed, future US-Japan meetings will not succeed." During the unproductive meeting held in Qingdao last month, the New People's Daily editorial urged the participants to pay special attention to the Jewish issue affecting the New Order, stating, "After close research, it is learned that the cause of the</p>
<p>China Incident</p>
<p>is the Jewish forces in the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. To fundamentally solve the China Incident, we should defeat the Jewish forces in China. The Qingdao meeting "should give serious consideration to this issue." On the 7th of this month, the New People's Daily's editorial to send off "representatives of Chinese newspapers to Japan also stated that the corruption and bias of today's newspapers are caused by "Jewish forces." News organizations of civil countries, which have always been known for their freedom and justice, namely Reuters, Havas, Associated Press, and Tass, are all under the influence of</p>
<p>Jewish tycoons</p>
<p>and controlled by them, becoming the mouthpiece of Jewish millionaires. The periodicals and newspapers of these news agencies are also used by the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union as propaganda tools. Civil country newspapers are trying to create war, so that their Jewish masters can take the opportunity to profit. The European War, the Spanish Civil War, the annexation of Czechoslovakia, and the China Incident were all promoted by Jewish tycoons, and all the disturbances in the world are caused by Jewish forces.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Japanese Troops in Xuzhou Search Everywhere, Over a Thousand Households in Liuguzhuang, Tongshan are Burned, Japanese Troops in Peixian are Ambushed and Severely Wounded <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Northern Jiangsu stated that the Japanese army headquarters in Xuzhou believed that various Chinese troops had repeatedly sabotaged railways, highways, and electric wires in the outskirts of Xuzhou, causing continuous blows to the Japanese puppet army, making it difficult for the Japanese puppet army to move. The Japanese puppet army, harboring resentment and revenge, has been looting and burning for the past month, but has not weakened the Chinese people's anti-Japanese sentiment. On the 12th of last month, more than 100 Japanese troops at the Sanbao Station on the Jinpu Railway, took three armored vehicles, first went to Ma, Lan, and burned down the schools and township government buildings, then went to Sujiahu to search, set fire to the village's schools and hospitals, and searched Chen Lingya's home, rummaging through boxes and cabinets, looting all the clothes, books and paintings, and then went to the Lin Guanzhuang temple warehouse, also set it on fire. The Tongshan Seventh District Standing Brigade then formed a bag-shaped formation to lure the Japanese puppet army to Liuguzhuang. Another mountain, Wang Bingyue, led the No. × Brigade, to greet the enemy head-on. Ji Fengru led the No. × Brigade, to attack from the left flank. Wu Huamin led the No. × Brigade, to attack from the right flank. Contact was made from 9:00 AM, and a fierce battle lasted for two hours. Eight Japanese soldiers were killed and six were wounded. The Chinese side also suffered heavy casualties. Later, because more than 100 Japanese troops from Baoguang Temple reinforced them, the Chinese Standing Brigade transferred its troops to avoid major sacrifices. The Chinese army only had one soldier killed and three wounded. The Japanese army, in their shame and anger, pointed out that Liuguzhuang was hiding guerrillas, and burned all the houses of the more than 300 households in the town. The fire was so bright that it lasted for three days and nights. The Japanese army also monitored the village, so the people did not dare to return to save it, causing more than 1,000 houses in the village, as well as the people's food, clothing, and all the property, to be burned into scorched earth. When the Japanese retreated, the people returned. Men, women, old and young, camped by the roadside in the cold wind, crying out in hunger and cold, and weeping together. The miserable scene was unbearable to witness. Li Fengru, the head of the Seventh District, said that because the district had been repeatedly ravaged by the Japanese puppet army, and the Japanese puppet village defense team had been constantly searching and looting, it was already ten rooms and nine empty. If they were to raise funds locally to provide relief again, there would be no surplus. Therefore, after a public decision in the district, representatives Liu Chengrui, Wang Huamin, and others were sent to the province to request relief funds from the authorities to relieve the suffering of the people and comfort the hearts of the people in the war zone.</p>
<p>On the 8th of last month, more than 100 Japanese troops in Peixian City attempted to level the road. After learning that the Chinese side was prepared, they fled back immediately. The Chinese side expected that the Japanese troops would come again the next day, so they ambushed on both sides of the road that night, from Dawangzhuang in the south to Miaodaokou in the north, a distance of more than ten li. Four squadrons of troops were ambushed in the west, and two squadrons of troops were ambushed in the east. They also buried five homemade electric mines on the highway between Weixiaolou and Weiying. County Chief Feng personally commanded. At 7:00 AM on the 9th, five Japanese vehicles, carrying more than 100 Japanese soldiers, one large gun, three hand mortars, and eight light and heavy machine guns, advanced north along the Peilong Highway. When they reached between Weixiaolou and Weiying, they triggered the electric mines, destroying two of the leading Japanese vehicles. More than 30 Japanese soldiers were torn to pieces. The Japanese soldiers in the two wrecked military vehicles hurriedly got out of the vehicles, and the Chinese ambush troops on both sides suddenly rose up and fired fiercely with concentrated firepower. More than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. The remaining soldiers resisted stubbornly in Zhangzhuang Xiaowangzhuang. The last vehicle returned to the city for reinforcements. At about 9:00 AM, the Japanese army sent seven vehicles, carrying 170 or 180 Japanese soldiers, two large guns, five hand mortars, and more than ten light and heavy machine guns, from Longguji in the south to Miaodaokou to reinforce them. At the same time, more than 100 Japanese infantry and cavalry, carrying one large gun and five light and heavy machine guns, reinforced them from Peicheng to Dawangzhuang. All of them were met with a painful blow from the Chinese army. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties. After a fierce battle until 5:00 PM, the Japanese army broke through and fled. In this battle, more than 60 Japanese soldiers were killed, five Japanese war horses were killed, five Japanese bodies were left behind, two Japanese vehicles and many other military supplies were destroyed. Chen Zhaolan, the squadron leader, Hu Dezhen, the squad leader, Cui Fuzhen and other officers and soldiers, 11 in number, made heroic sacrifices. There were also 15 other officers and soldiers wounded. The Deputy Headquarters and the Provincial Government have recorded County Chief Feng's great merits once.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Rice Robbery in Suzhou <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The common people are panicked and take risks</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Due to the lack of rice and soaring prices, the rice stores in the city have closed one after another. The price of white rice per stone has reached 29 yuan, but there are still many who hoard and manipulate prices and Japanese merchants who absorb and transport it back to their country or transport it to Shanghai in an attempt to sell it at a higher price. The other day at a tea party, there was a small amount of rough rice, but it was still traded secretly at a high price. For example, Qianfeng Heng once again absorbed 25 stones of rough rice, and the amount of the secret transaction was 14 yuan and 10 cents. Therefore, it can only be seen that it is absorbing it, but the storefront is closed, and it has not been seen that it has been sold. Because the company has already hoarded more than 700 stones, its intentions can be imagined. The rice shortage for days has caused extreme panic among the common people. On the morning of the 14th, a rice robbery occurred on Zaoshi Street outside Xumen. Forty or fifty poor people, holding hemp bags and other tools, pried open the back door of the Tongfeng Brewery and rushed in to rob fifteen or six stones of rice piled up inside, and then dispersed in a commotion.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Ministry of Education to Improve the Treatment of Primary School Teachers and Calculate Communication Salaries for Twelve Months <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 19th) Since President Chiang Kai-shek issued a telegram to primary school principals, teachers and staff, and people from all walks of life in the country in the middle of last month, people across the country have been extremely concerned about the issue of primary school teachers' treatment. On the 19th, the reporter made a special trip to the Ministry of Education to inquire about what recent measures the Ministry has taken in this regard. It is said that primary school education is related to the foundation of the country, and this year, the central government has paid great attention to primary school education, so it has increased the funds for compulsory education year by year. However, in recent years, various social undertakings have become increasingly developed, and the demand for people has increased many times, and the rewards are also more generous. Therefore, the original treatment of primary school teachers has become increasingly low, and many have changed to other jobs. The Ministry of Education has issued a special order to the education departments of all provinces and cities, requiring that the salaries of primary school teachers must be calculated on a twelve-month basis each year, and paid in full each month, and the salary amount should be appropriately increased. At the same time, it has also drafted a regulation on the treatment of primary school teachers, which includes detailed provisions on the treatment, protection, rewards, vacations, and free primary schools for children of primary school teachers. After the implementation of this method, the spiritual and material lives of primary school teachers will be improved, and it can be hoped that they will be happy in their work and cultivate talents for the country.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association issued an important announcement yesterday, stating that coal balls are a necessary fuel, and the recent surge in market prices affects the lives of ordinary people. Failure to remedy this situation will inevitably lead to panic. The Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association has invited its members to jointly discuss temporary relief measures as follows: (1) Starting from the 20th of this month, the sales price of coal balls ex-factory (delivery from the factory) is 110 yuan per ton (transactions outside the factory must not exceed the factory price). Retail prices at factory outlets and coal shops throughout the city are 5.8 yuan per hundred catties (i.e., per dan), and must not be arbitrarily increased. (2) Those with coal ball warehouse receipts should pay the warehouse rent and pick up the coal within ten days, from the 20th to the 29th of this month. After the deadline, delivery will be suspended, and another method will be devised to recover the goods at the original price to supply the common people. (3) All coal shop operators without warehouse receipts should temporarily endure the hardship. From the 20th to the 29th of this month, do not rush to buy coal balls from the coal factories in the morning so that the factories can clear the warehouse receipts. Sales will resume in the afternoon for cash transactions. (4) Please coal factories produce as much as possible to prevent interruptions in supply. The above four measures are all for the purpose of stabilizing the market and overcoming difficulties together. A special joint notice is issued, and it is hoped that all coal ball manufacturers, coal shop operators, and warehouse receipt holders in the city will comply. It is reported that although the amount of coal balls stored in Shanghai is not as large as the rumored millions of tons, it is still hundreds of thousands of tons. It is unknown whether the fair sales will have unlimited quantities.</p>
<p>Advising the Coal Ball Industry to Produce as Much as Possible</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association yesterday, stating, "In response to your letter and the four resolutions attached regarding the rising price of coal balls, we have learned that the four measures resolved by your association are practical and comprehensive, and are completely based on the standpoint of taking the overall situation into account, emphasizing righteousness over profit, and are deeply admired. We have immediately published your four resolutions in the China News and the Xinmin Daily. We still hope that your association will notify its members to produce as much as possible so that there will be no shortage of supply. If small factories are affected by the lack of coal dust, the major factories should provide timely and uniform assistance to avoid interruptions. We hope that your association will maintain its perseverance and preside over the implementation." The Chamber also sent letters to the Coal Industry and Coal Shop Industry Associations to notify their members to strictly comply with the price limit.</p>
<p>Notice to Citizens Not to Accumulate Spot Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association issued a notice yesterday, stating that the raw materials for coal balls have been fully secured and transported to Shanghai by the coal companies in the city to meet the needs of the city. The public organizations and celebrities are concerned about the people's livelihood and have agreed to request the shipping companies to reduce freight rates and transport raw materials. Therefore, the price drop is inevitable, and there may even be a situation of oversupply. As for the coal ball warehouse receipt issue, the public organizations have come forward to preside over the discussions and have a solution. Therefore, we hereby respectfully inform all users in the city not to listen to rumors and accumulate spot goods or entrust pre-orders. If individual users accumulate spot goods, it will inevitably cause producers to be doubly crowded and unable to cope, which in turn will create opportunities for warehouse receipt holders and coal shops to arbitrarily raise prices. It is rumored that prices have soared to over seven yuan per hundred catties, which is shocking. This is all due to the reaction of hoarders and users accumulating cash. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will correct this, so that the current panic situation can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Crowds Rush to Buy Fair-Priced Flour</p>
<p>To maintain the food supply for the people, the flour industry has designated 27 flour shops, including Ruiji, in the two concessions to implement fair-priced flour sales for one month starting yesterday. With the police maintaining order, fair sales were implemented. Each 49-pound bag was priced at 10.03 yuan, and 7,500 bags were sold at fair prices each day, supplied by Fufeng and Fuxin flour factories. Sales were conducted from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM until sold out. The crowds of ordinary people buying flour were no less than those buying rice. The flour shops sold out on schedule yesterday and immediately went to Fufeng and Fuxin factories to get more flour. Fair sales will continue today. During this fair sales period, flour shops will suspend sales of other brands of flour, benefiting the common people.</p>
<p>Noodle Industry Needs Fair-Priced Flour</p>
<p>The Noodle Industry, represented by Wang Jinwen and Wang Fuxin, yesterday reported to the Public Works Department the circumstances under which they had been forced to temporarily suspend business and submitted a report stating, "We are reporting the matter of skyrocketing flour prices and shortages. Since the shortage of rice and flour, our industry has done its best to maintain the market and has not raised prices. We have exhausted our efforts to purchase from various flour shops, but have been repeatedly rejected at high prices. Member shops have reported to the association that they have no goods to make and have been forced to suspend business. Although the authorities are now selling flour at fair prices, it is difficult to maintain the overall situation in Shanghai. Therefore, we respectfully report the situation and ask for assistance." It is reported that the industry has also requested the authorities to ask the flour shops to supply the industry with 3,000 bags of flour at fair prices each day to maintain business.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Urges Prompt Opening</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce replied to the Noodle Industry Association yesterday, stating, "In response to your letter, we have learned that the skyrocketing price and shortage of flour is of concern to all parties and we are planning to remedy the situation. We have already told you everything yesterday. Your association's suggestion to stabilize prices can be achieved. However, the sale of noodles is as important as the sale of rice by rice shops. If the entire city suspends business, it will only contribute to panic, which must not happen. We urge your association to lead the industry and open for business as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Rice Merchant Punished with Detention for Violating the Law</p>
<p>Since the authorities in the concessions stipulated price limits for domestic rice, with indica rice not exceeding 33 yuan and japonica rice not exceeding 40 yuan, and sent detectives to the trading venues to monitor transactions and strictly prohibit transactions exceeding the price limits, on the 17th, rice broker Du Hongshou (resident of No. 217 Qinghe Lane, Sapo Road), from Haining, and Qu Baizhen (resident of No. 10 Xincai City Road), manager of Fongsheng Rice Shop at No. 467 Fujian Road, were arrested by Zhang Yingmei, a Chinese detective of the Public Works Department's Political Department, and detective Mao Guobao for exceeding the price limits.</p>
<p>The details of the incident are as follows: (1) At 10:30 AM on the 17th, rice broker Du Hongshou went to the rice market at Qinglian Pavilion Teahouse, No. 515 Fuzhou Road, to sell a sample of japonica rice. When market manager Yin Yuzhang asked about the price, Du quoted 53.5 yuan per stone. The detectives heard about this and, believing that Du's quoted price violated the law and exceeded the price limit, arrested him. (2) The detectives of the Public Works Department's Political Department learned that the</p>
<p>Fongsheng Rice Shop</p>
<p>at No. 467 Fujian Road was selling rice exceeding the price limit. On the 15th, they instructed officials Xu Zhongshen and coolie Wu Changchun to purchase three yuan worth of No. 2 white rice, which weighed only 9.545 catties. Calculating the price per stone, it would reach 50 yuan. They then obtained an arrest warrant from the First Special Court and arrested the manager of the shop, Qu Baizhen. Yesterday morning, they were both sent to the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Fang Zhishan, the police lawyer, explained the incident and prosecuted them for</p>
<p>Violating the Law</p>
<p>in violation of Article 33 of the Police Offenses Punishment Law. He also requested that the defendants be severely punished according to the law, as their actions endangered social stability. After questioning by Judge Shen Shanzeng, Du Hongshou and Qu Baizhen were sentenced to 15 days of detention each as a warning.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Drop Again as Fair Sales Approach</p>
<p>After the Fair Sales Committee decided to hold a second round of fair sales starting on the 23rd, it decided to redistribute measuring instruments. The concession authorities also decided to issue a notice. The common people were overjoyed to hear that fair sales were approaching. The closed rice shops have not yet reopened. As for rice prices, due to the approaching fair sales and the closure of rice shops, demand has sharply decreased. Therefore, there was a third price drop yesterday, which benefited the general public. It is estimated that No. 1 Saigon dropped by about one yuan, mixed broken rice dropped by 50 cents, and Danyang white dropped by one yuan. In total, since the closure of rice shops three days ago, each commodity has dropped by an average of two to four yuan. Therefore, fair sales are the only way to suppress rice prices. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will hold them for a long time to benefit the citizens.</p>
<p>Over 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive Again</p>
<p>The price of foreign rice in the city has already exceeded the price limit for domestic rice. The source of domestic rice is blocked, so the black market price has exceeded the 50 yuan mark. If no measures are taken to suppress the price, the future of the people's livelihood is worrying. As for foreign rice, it should not continue to rise continuously. Although it is affected by the shortage of foreign exchange, the capital used to purchase the rice currently on sale in the market is not the current exchange rate. The crux of the matter is self-evident. It is reported that on the 19th, Jardine Matheson's Mingsheng轮 brought 15,638 bags from Hong Kong, and Ding Sheng轮 also brought 7,070 bags from Hong Kong. In addition to 4,944 bags from Hong Kong, Taikoo's Jiangsu轮 also brought 7,694 bags from Haiphong. The three ships brought a total of 35,346 bags on the 19th.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Murder Case at Central Hotel Last Night, Lu Yuting Assassinated, Three Bullets in Vital Areas, Died of Injuries, Gunman Escaped and Was Hunted <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>At around 7 PM last night, a murder case occurred at No. 228 Central Hotel, Wuma Road, Public Concession. The victim was Lu Yuting, from Henan, who had been living in Shanghai for many years. He was shot three times and immediately taken to the hospital, but died of his injuries. The killer escaped and is being hunted. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opened a Teahouse with Many Connections</p>
<p>Lu Yuting, from Hanzhuang, Shenqiu County, northeast of Henan, was 41 years old. He used to run the Dongxinglou Restaurant on Shilu and Wuma Roads, but later closed it down. He usually had many connections and had joined the circle of the late Lu Liankui, who favored him. Recently, he often went in and out of the western part of Shanghai, which attracted attention. Therefore, it is generally believed that the case may be a political event.</p>
<p>Three Men Suddenly Came and Shot Him</p>
<p>At 6:45 PM last night, Lu Yuting was handling affairs in his usual manner at Room 228 of the Central Hotel. At the same time, Lu had made an appointment with another person surnamed Lu to have dinner in the room. Suddenly, two men in Western suits and one man in Chinese clothes, all wearing riding breeches and woolen overcoats, went straight upstairs and lingered for a long time in the lobby on the second floor. Just as the tea boy went to another place to make tea, the three strong men broke into Lu's residence. At that time, Lu was wandering in the room. The three men saw Lu and immediately drew their guns and shot him.</p>
<p>Shot Three Times, the Killer Escaped</p>
<p>Seeing the people coming with weapons, Lu tried to avoid them, but a bullet flew over and hit Lu's forehead. A second bullet hit his chest, and a third bullet hit his waist. He immediately bled profusely and suddenly fell to the ground. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the killers quietly went out the door. At that time, the guests in the rooms nearby suddenly heard gunshots and were quite afraid. They only heard someone calling out "robbery" and did not dare to ask questions. The killers were able to go downstairs and escape into the crowd during that moment.</p>
<p>Died of Vital Injuries</p>
<p>The tea boy of the hotel immediately entered Room 228 to check and saw that Lu had fallen in a pool of blood. He immediately reported to the police. Later, Western police officer No. 137 and Chinese detective Liu Junqing and others from the Old Gate Police Station arrived at the scene. The injured Lu Yuting was sent to Renji Hospital by ambulance, but died of his vital injuries at 7:15 PM.</p>
<p>The Body Will Be Coffin Today</p>
<p>Lu lives at No. 19 Yuren Lane, Yunnan Road, Hongde Hospital upstairs. He has a younger brother named Lanting, a wife named Lu Xu, a son named Bingsheng, who is six years old, and two adopted daughters, Shuying and Shuzhen, who are still unmarried. For the convenience of interacting with all parties, Lu opened a long-term room at No. 228 Central Hotel. Last night, after hearing the news of the shooting, his wife rushed to inquire and cried for a long time when she saw Lu bleeding all over. She then went to the hospital to take care of his funeral. Lu's body will be moved to the Dazhong Funeral Home on Changping Road today for encoffining.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Chamber of Commerce Sincerely Admonishes Merchants and People Not to Hoard or Collect, Hoping Residents Will Not Wholesale or Pre-Purchase, Giving People the Opportunity to Speculate <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a sincere admonition to merchants and people yesterday, stating, "Since the New Year, prices of all goods have soared, even more fiercely than last year. The three items of rice, coal, and flour alone are enough to make it difficult for ordinary salaried people to support a family and have nothing to cook with."</p>
<p>People Are In Panic</p>
<p>They cannot live in peace. The sense of oppression in the lives of the city's residents is greater today than ever before. As for the reasons, the high cost of transportation, the difficulty of procurement, the increase in floating expenses, and the tightening of foreign exchange are all sufficient to contribute to the rise in prices, and cannot be attributed solely to one party. However, a portion of people are taking advantage of the opportunity</p>
<p>To Engage In Private Profits</p>
<p>Taking commodities as a speculative goal and hoarding as a shortcut to wealth, this is also a blatant fact. Moreover, there are those who are not merchants, but are confused by rumors and believe that collecting commodities is more sure than storing funds, pushing the boat along the water and creating this situation. Those residents with foresight</p>
<p>Cannot Help But Be Wary</p>
<p>And can only use all their belongings to wholesale and pre-purchase to supply several months of consumption. Supply and demand are increasingly unbalanced, and unknowingly, this gives these people the opportunity to speculate. Therefore, today's situation of soaring prices cannot be blamed solely on the situation and has nothing to do with the people of Shanghai. It must be known that mutual benefit is the greatest benefit. If the current situation</p>
<p>Continues to Evolve</p>
<p>Then at least 90 percent of the city's residents will lose their purchasing power. The foundation of commerce is ultimately built on the majority of consumers. If the majority of the people turn into exhausted carp waiting for death, with no consumers to buy, then the hoarded materials will also turn into frozen stones. If these few people think they have seized the opportunity and dream of this year's</p>
<p>Golden Age</p>
<p>And think it will be far better than last year, this kind of thinking is a mistaken illusion and will inevitably lead to mutual destruction and falling into the abyss. This is what the Chamber of Commerce sincerely admonishes to awaken the deaf and blind. At this time when the political program is out of control and beyond our reach, we rely on everyone's conscious awareness to reverse the catastrophe of panic in the city. We respectfully offer this advice and hope you will all take it to heart."</p>

<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Wan Pao" reports that, according to travelers arriving in this city yesterday (the 18th), an explosion occurred on the Jinghu Railway east of Benniu on Saturday and Sunday nights, destroying a section of the railway and four freight cars. The Jinghu Railway is still maintaining passenger traffic as usual. Passengers arriving at the damaged area must disembark and walk about half a mile to board another train. It is believed that guerrillas planted the landmines that caused the explosion. Benniu is located west of Changzhou, about 130 kilometers from Nanjing. According to a news agency, aviation industry sources say that three train cars were bombed and overturned near Xinfeng Station between Zhenjiang and Shanghai on the Jinghu Railway on the morning of the 18th, and the tracks were also destroyed. The cause of the bombing is currently unknown here.</p>

<p>Salvation Army Major Morris announced that at yesterday's luncheon, staff of the Dutch Bank's Li Kan Paper Company donated a large sum of 20,000 yuan, suddenly increasing the total donations to 100,000 yuan. In addition to this large donation, miscellaneous donations totaling about 50,000 yuan were received this week. The Army is planning to use this 20,000 yuan to send refugees who can return to their hometowns and to provide urgently needed loans to those seeking a livelihood. Morris expressed his admiration for the enthusiastic donations from the Chinese people, believing that they have greatly benefited the refugees. The Army also received a donation of 500 yuan from the French Ambassador to China yesterday.</p>
<p>Serving the People</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Salvation Army launched its fundraising campaign, it has been widely sympathized with by all sectors of society. The Army's office has been crowded with people making donations. Mr. Ma Ruishan, the Shanghai District Officer of the Army, sent a special letter to all sectors of society yesterday, saying: "To Whom It May Concern, the Army has been engaged in various relief efforts in Shanghai for twelve years, and has been honored by the approval of all sectors of society. As the city's economy declines, the number of poor people is increasing daily. The Army's work over the past ten years has been based on the spirit of love to serve the people and strive hard, but its ability to expand its scope of service depends on the sympathy and assistance of all sectors of society."</p>
<p>Relying on Assistance</p>
<p>Since the August 13th battle, the Army has been serving in refugee relief work. Through its interactions with the refugees, it is deeply aware of their suffering and feels a sense of helplessness. There are countless people in need of assistance. Therefore, a certain Chinese philanthropist recently expressed his willingness to donate [blank] yuan to the Army's expenses anonymously, which shows his sympathy and recognition of the Army's good intentions. We have always admired your concern for the victims of disasters. If you trust the Army's past measures and do not deviate from the original purpose of the grant, we sincerely hope that you will provide strong assistance and advocate for it. The Army's 1940 budget depends on this. Every penny will be used to benefit the poor, regardless of geographical differences or ethnic divisions. The service extends to Chinese and foreign compatriots alike. We enclose a copy of this city's monthly publication for your reference, and we hope you will not hesitate to give us your advice. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Customs Superintendent and Tax Commissioner issued a notice stating that the measures for banning the import of foreign goods during the extraordinary period and the measures for prohibiting the import of goods made from prohibited imported foreign raw materials in guerrilla areas have been announced by the Customs separately. Now, a telegram from the Ministry of Finance states that all foreign nationals in China who purchase and transport prohibited imported goods for their own use shall apply for an import permit in accordance with the regulations to be verified and released by the Customs. In addition to complying with this, a notice is hereby issued to inform the public.</p>

<p>The eastern side of North Jiangxi Road, north of Suzhou Creek, was blocked by the Japanese last autumn with barbed wire and steel frames, stretching for several miles from Bazilu in the north to Tiantonglu in the south. Only gaps were opened at Haininglu and Wenjianshi Road to allow residents to enter the Hongkou area. Two guard posts were set up on both sides of the gaps, manned by Japanese soldiers who inspected residents entering and leaving. Since the Japanese announced the opening of the Hongkou and other areas, the area can now be freely accessed. However, the sentries are still not withdrawn. The Japanese soldiers have now begun to remove the section of barbed wire and steel frame at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Bazilu. It is said that they will continue to clear it later. However, the businesses in the blocked area have suffered greatly due to obstructed traffic, leading to a lack of customers and extremely sluggish business. More than 30 businesses have closed down one after another due to losses and bankruptcy.</p>

<p>The Reuter correspondent in Tokyo reported on the 18th that, regarding the rumor in Shanghai that US Ambassador to China Johnson plans to meet with the British and French ambassadors in Chongqing to request that Japan open the Yangtze River between Nanjing and Hankou, the Japanese Navy spokesman recently told reporters that this may not be realized. As Japan has not yet completed its preparations for opening the Yangtze River below Nanjing, it will not consider opening the Yangtze River between Nanjing and Hankou. As for Johnson's taking the Yunnan Railway, which is still being bombed by the Japanese, the Navy spokesman claimed that he had not heard that the travel plan had been notified to the Japanese side, nor had he heard of any special arrangements to ensure Johnson's safety. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stated that it had not heard of the US Ambassador's travel plan, but said that Johnson may have notified the local Japanese authorities.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhu Shaoping, a senior cadre of the Shanghai YMCA, was recently appointed as the new Deputy Consul at the Consulate General in Manila. According to news from Manila, Mr. Zhu arrived in Manila on the morning of the 29th of last month aboard President Puck's ship. Consul General Yang Guangxing, Consul Mo Jien, Secretary Huang Rongde, and Standing Committee members Wang Quansheng and Xu Youchao all went to the pier to welcome him and escorted him to the Datong Hotel to rest. Mr. Zhu is in his fifties, full of energy, and extremely [blank]. According to him, he boarded the ship in Hong Kong on the evening of the 26th, which was the day the US-Japan commercial treaty expired. Most Americans in Hong Kong expressed their unwillingness to renew the treaty. When asked if he had been to the Philippines before, Mr. Zhu said that this was his fourth time. Consul General Yang specifically hosted a welcome dinner for Mr. Zhu at the Oriental Club that afternoon.</p>
<p>New Plans of the Consulate General</p>
<p>Consul General Yang of the Manila Consulate General recently made a statement to reporters after the arrival of the newly appointed Deputy Consul Zhu Shaoping. He said that Mr. Zhu's coming to Manila to take office is responsible for the management of overseas Chinese education in the Philippines. He hopes that the leaders of the overseas Chinese education community and the students of various schools in the Philippines will cooperate to make overseas Chinese education more rationalized and to promote it further. The Consulate General has new plans for overseas Chinese education this year. The main points are as follows: (A) Regarding faculty and staff, Deputy Consul Zhu Shaoping will contact the Overseas Chinese Education Association in this city to ensure that the schools work hard to implement the following three things: (1) Universal Mandarin instruction, (2) Launching the New Life Movement, starting from the schools and spreading it to all overseas Chinese compatriots in the Philippines, (3) Convening an all-Philippines overseas Chinese education conference, with the Overseas Chinese Education Association as the base camp, convening the education conference in Manila to review the past and plan for the future, and to establish the direction of overseas Chinese education in the Philippines. (B) Regarding students, there is currently an organization called the Overseas Chinese Students' Union in this city, but its work is slightly lax. The Consulate General has begun to investigate and collect statistics on Chinese students in various universities in this bird [typo], and to launch its organization. University students have a greater responsibility than other primary and secondary school students for the tasks of the motherland and leading overseas students in carrying out wartime work. It is hoped that overseas Chinese university students in this island will have an organization like the American Chinese University Students' Union to carry out various national salvation activities, such as publishing publications and contacting student leaders and faculty members from various schools to carry out anti-Japanese propaganda work for the motherland. In addition to the "Overseas Chinese Students' Union" and the "Philippine Chinese Students' National Salvation Association," other student groups that are about to be established include the "Guangdong Students' Union in the Philippines." Mr. Zhu will be responsible for guiding all of these student groups.</p>

<p>Shaoxing is Peaceful and Communications are Still Open</p>
<p>Japanese Attempt to Invade Keqiao</p>
<p>The Battle is Extremely Fierce</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army secretly crossed the Qiantang River and landed in Xiaoshan, China has dispatched a large army to block them. The Japanese army that landed is already unable to withstand the pressure. The Japanese army stationed in Xiaoshan is attempting to invade Keqiao in Shaoxing and Jianshan in Zhuji in two directions. The Chinese army is fiercely resisting. Yesterday, a telegram from Shaoxing to Shanghai reported that the Japanese army attempted to invade Keqiao, and the battle was fierce. Shaoxing is as peaceful as usual. The telegram from Shanghai to Shaoxing and the long-distance telephone from Ningbo to Shaoxing are still open and have not been interrupted. The coastal areas are also peaceful, but the population of each county has been evacuated.</p>

<p>The Hot Water Industry to Hold a General Meeting of Members on Schedule</p>
<p>More than 500 hot water shops have been affected by the rising coal prices. Except for a few that still have coal reserves and can barely maintain their operations, most hot water shops have decided to close down. Residents, institutions, organizations, and schools are deeply inconvenienced. All sectors of society sympathize with the industry's difficulties and will provide assistance. It is hoped that the industry association will clearly identify the issues and handle them step by step in order to quickly resolve the problem. According to a reporter from "New Voice News," the Hot Water Industry Association has scheduled a general meeting of all industry representatives for the afternoon of the 25th of this month to seek solutions to the coal shortage. It is said that the steps to be taken in the future will be decided at that time. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has sent investigators to the association for several days to investigate and summoned Mr. Zhang Deji, the chairman of the association, to inquire about the coal supply and market prices of coal companies in the past, in order to find ways to suppress coal prices.</p>

<p>The Shaoxing Native Place Association in Shanghai is Raising Donations to Relief the Xiaoshao Refugees. Hundreds of Thousands of People are Displaced on the Front Line of Qiantang River. We Hope that Compatriots and Ladies from All Walks of Life Will Contribute Generously.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of war in eastern Zhejiang, news of unrest in Xiaoshao spread. Residents on the front line south of the Qiantang River, supporting the old and leading the young, crying for hunger and cold, and displaced, numbered in the hundreds of thousands. The Shaoxing Native Place Association in Shanghai, with its deep hometown ties, could not sit idly by. It has ordered the design and dispatch of personnel to Shaoxing to handle relief efforts. However, this is a major matter, which requires a huge amount of money and needs to be used urgently. Yesterday, it issued a special notice to the people of Shaoxing in Shanghai, asking them to act according to their conscience, those with money to contribute money, those with strength to contribute strength, and to automatically assist in solving the urgent needs together. It is hoped that ladies from all walks of life will take the heart of saving others as saving themselves, and contribute generously and enthusiastically. The designated collection points have been established: Bank of China (Avenue Joffre), Minfu Bank (Tianjin Road, Jiangxi Road), Zhongyi Trust Company (Beijing Road), Anyu Qianzhuang (Ningbo Road, Xingrenli), Tongrun Qianzhuang (Tianjin Road, Jiyili), Baofeng Qianzhuang (Tianjin Road). Many people have enthusiastically pledged donations in recent days.</p>

<p>The British and Japanese Will Resume Negotiations on the Tianjin Issue. Both Sides are Now Preparing the Groundwork for a Solution, but There are Still Many Disputes Over the Asama Maru Incident.</p>
<p>The Reuter correspondent in Tokyo reported on the 18th that Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, recently suffered a severe cold and went to Hayama for recuperation. He is now recovering. It is observed that after Sir Craigie returns to Tokyo, he will resume negotiations on the Tianjin issue. Regarding this issue,</p>
<p>Meetings Between British and Japanese</p>
<p>Low-level officials have been ongoing for some time, but formal discussions have been hampered by the Asama Maru incident. British authorities today told reporters that they believe there is a good chance of reaching a solution to the Tianjin issue. At this moment, however, it is necessary to prepare the groundwork for a solution. Hachiro Arita's reappointment as Foreign Minister is a favorable factor, as Arita is familiar with this issue and Japan is concerned about the negotiations</p>
<p>Satisfactory Conclusion</p>
<p>As for the Asama Maru incident, the British authorities admitted that the issue of the remaining German prisoners has not been resolved. This point will depend on whether Japanese political leaders intend to strive for an immediate solution or leave it for later discussion. Although various obstacles still exist,</p>
<p>A Sense of Things</p>
<p>Has Improved. What the British authorities believe is, of course, different from Arita's hopeful remarks on the Tianjin issue in the Diet recently. It is worth noting that although the Japanese are now busy dealing with other matters, they are still unremitting in their request for the return of the Germans still detained by the British.</p>

<p>Two Million Yuan Has Been Issued</p>
<p>The Central Bank previously requested the Ministry of Finance to approve the issuance of one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes to alleviate the shortage of subsidiary currency in the Shanghai market. Due to the high demand for fractional currency notes on the market, it telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to request approval for increased issuance, which has been approved. The increased issuance will depend on market needs. It is heard that the bank has commissioned the American company Yongning to print the notes and will issue them at any time as needed by the market. It has already issued one million yuan.</p>

<p>The Women's Community Launches a "No Perm" Movement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Women's Federation received a suggestion from Ms. Qin Shuluan yesterday, requesting the promotion of a "no perm" movement for women, stating that hair is a natural gift. Our women's community originally implemented haircuts for convenience and thrift. Recently, perms have become popular, wasting time, money, and posing unexpected dangers. Not perming has natural beauty. Especially recently, prices in Shanghai have been rising. Our female compatriots should implement the "no perm movement" for the sake of self-help and helping others, and transfer the savings to disaster relief funds. I hope you will promote it.</p>

<p>School Relocation, Dismantling and Repairing of Parts. The Principal of Jianghai Primary School is Accused of Theft. Both Sides Have Different Opinions. The Case is Awaiting Inspection and Review.</p>
<p>Hua An (i.e., Hua Hou) from Zhejiang Province founded Jianghai Primary School at No. 318 Weihaiwei Road, which has been in operation for six or seven years. The landlord has also changed hands several times. In October last year, Wu Yonghua, the owner of Lihua Automobile Hardware Store at No. 367 Weihaiwei Road, bought the property from the owner Li Yangzhi for 20,750 yuan, intending to</p>
<p>Take it Back for His Own Use</p>
<p>Therefore, Wu Yonghua filed a lawsuit against Hua An in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court, requesting relocation. After the trial, the two parties reached a settlement. On December 6th last year, Hua An was ordered to relocate before the end of February of this year, and Wu Yonghua would subsidize the relocation fee of 4,000 yuan. At that time, except for the initial payment of 3,500 yuan, the remaining 500 yuan would be paid after the house was handed over. Recently, Hua is beginning to relocate in succession, but the original flushing toilets, fireplaces, doors and windows in the room are</p>
<p>All Dismantled</p>
<p>Sold to the old goods store opened by Guan Weibin at No. 557 Beijing Road for a price of 240 yuan. Wu Yonghua learned about this and reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station for stealing buildings, and sent Detective Ni Runsheng to detain Hua An and put him in the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyers Jiang Baolian, Peng Qixin, and Chen Shuzhi stated the case and prosecuted according to Article 320 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Hua An confessed that</p>
<p>Six or Seven Years Ago</p>
<p>I invested 2,500 yuan to take over the New Life Primary School and renamed it Jianghai Primary School. All the decorations and parts were included. Now that I have relocated, I will of course dismantle them. Therefore, what I dismantled was not the landlord's property. According to Wu Yonghua's complaint, the dismantled items were iron pipes inside the walls, as well as flushing toilets and fireplaces, which were originally the landlord's property. The defendant should not have dismantled and sold them privately. He also hired a lawyer to appear in court and filed a civil lawsuit requesting compensation for losses of more than 5,000 yuan. Judge Zhan held that</p>
<p>The Items in Dispute</p>
<p>Whose property they belong to is difficult to determine at once because the owner has changed hands several times. It is necessary to conduct an on-site inspection. He ordered the defendant to be detained and reviewed after an inspection at 3 pm today.</p>

It is learned that the pedestrian's name is Zhang Peng, 45 years old, who previously held an important position in the Nanjing government. This kidnapping may have a political background.</p>

<p>The Defendant Loses in the Tongrenhe Paint Store Lawsuit</p>
<p>During the outbreak of the European War last year, Yun Huaogao, a shareholder of Tongrenhe Paint Store at No. 80 Minkuo Road, believed that the supply route would be blocked and intended to hoard goods for speculation, which led to a dispute with Xu Chengxun, the manager of the store from Shaoxing. On December 30, Yun reported to the French Police, accusing Xu of embezzlement, and sent detectives to arrest Xu. Later, a settlement was reached at the police station, and Xu resigned from his position as manager and abandoned the bonus and special reward he was entitled to. Xu felt aggrieved after the incident and immediately hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against Yun Huaogao to confirm that the written statement was invalid. The case has been concluded after a trial by Judge Tan, and the main text states: "The written statement signed by the plaintiff on December 30, 1939, is hereby revoked, and the litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant."</p>

<p>The Manager of Huaxin Embroidery Company Embezzles Large Sums of Money and is Punished</p>
<p>Voluntarily Repays the Full Amount and is Sentenced to a Suspended Sentence</p>
<p>Shi Zhongfu (34 years old, resident of No. 22 Guangdong Road), the deputy manager of Huaxin Embroidery Company at No. 160 Avenue Edward VII, and a native of Pudong, took advantage of his position from September last year to January this year and took advantage of the fact that his owner Zhang Zhengyi was unfamiliar with English to handle the procedures for remittances and transactions for overseas merchant Lido Company and Canadian Youliubing Company, and with American Chase Bank. Shi secretly hid the bills of exchange remitted by the foreign merchants, and induced Zhang to issue Chase Bank checks that had not been filled in with numbers, ostensibly to pay small amounts, but in reality filled in huge amounts. Recently, Zhang detected this and commissioned Lawyer Ma to report to the police and arrest Shi. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court and prosecuted for embezzlement. The plaintiff also commissioned Lawyer Ma to file a civil lawsuit requesting that the defendant be ordered to repay 18,101 yuan in national currency. Judge Yue took the stand for the trial. The defendant admitted the embezzlement and requested leniency, willing to clear the accounts after his release and repay the full amount. After verifying the confession in court, Shi Zhongfu was sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment for continuous embezzlement, with a three-year suspended sentence.</p>

<p>The Pay Raise Issue for Paint Industry Workers is Resolved</p>
<p>The paint industry workers in this city previously felt threatened by life and their original wages were insufficient for expenses. Therefore, they asked the industry union to negotiate with the employers to appropriately increase wages to provide relief. Zhu Yongliang, Yan Guifang, Tao Xiong, Qian Zhicheng, and Fang Tieliang, responsible representatives of the industry union, and Zhang Zhongyuan, Shen Suitang, and Du Gengxin, representatives of the industry association, had sincere discussions on the 17th of this month. As a result, the employers expressed deep sympathy for the workers' difficult lives and promised to increase the wages of the workers by 12 cents per worker and the meal allowance by 25 cents per worker, for a total of one yuan and 49 cents per worker for food and wages. As for the date of implementation, it has been decided to publish a notice in the newspaper immediately. The long-brewing labor unrest in the industry was resolved satisfactorily under mutual understanding.</p>

<p>Many People in the Chicken and Duck Industry are Accused of Selling Public Property. The Trial Opened Yesterday and Witnesses Will Be Summoned for Further Review.</p>
<p>Zhang Yongcai, the general manager of the United Business Office of the Shanghai Chicken and Duck Industry Association, Zhang Wenxiang, the chairman of the board, Zhang Lizhong, the chief accountant, Mao Zhongyu, the business director, and Zhou Zhizhuan, the manager of Fengcheng Heap Company at No. 6 Bund, French Concession, were recently sued in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court by eight shareholders of the office, including Cui Shikui, Shao Yunxuan, and Feng Guifu, through Lawyer Liu Xiang, for forging documents and</p>
<p>Selling Public Property</p>
<p>It is claimed that in 1937, the plaintiffs and others jointly organized the office, referred to as Lianji Public Firm, rented houses in Xinkai River, and built houses at No. 317 Masinan Road as a market. Since then, counting the business, after deducting expenses, there is still a surplus of tens of thousands of yuan. The first defendant seized the money. Although the board of supervisors repeatedly ordered them to return the money and check the accounts, the defendant</p>
<p>Turned a Deaf Ear</p>
<p>Recently, they forged meeting minutes and resolutions, and sold the publicly built market houses to Chen Bingji, that is, Zhou Zhizhuan, the manager of Fengcheng Company. They also changed the number of the office in Xinkai River without authorization and operated privately, obviously violating the criminal law. Therefore, it is requested to detain and interrogate them. According to the complaint, the court summoned the parties to the Criminal Division 2 yesterday for interrogation, and the lawyers of both sides appeared in court. The plaintiffs stated the above-mentioned process, and then the defendants were interrogated separately. It is known that the case will be heard again after the witnesses are summoned.</p>

<p>The Shanghai West Gambling Den Will Close for One Week</p>
<p>The Shanghai West gambling dens have been competing fiercely recently, and new gambling dens are being established every day. The gambling trend in Shanghai West is on the rise. Since the rumor that the Japanese banned the operation of gambling dens spread, the owners of the gambling dens have been trying to take action. At first, it was rumored that only three houses would be allowed to be established, all of which must be named as clubs, and the rest would be closed at the end of the month or moved to Nanshi. Then, it was rumored that the owners of the gambling dens had requested the relevant parties to postpone the deadline for closure. According to a reporter from Huawen News Agency, as a result of the activities of the owners of the gambling dens, they are allowed to continue to open, but they must all close for one week at the end of the month to ease the external atmosphere, and then resume business. However, each gambling den must be equipped with a dance hall or cafe, and neon signs are not allowed to be installed to avoid attracting attention.</p>

He has a daughter named Jinmei, who is nineteen years old and not yet betrothed. She is gentle, virtuous, and quiet, truly a maiden of a humble family. Zhang Jinquan, a rascal residing nearby in Zhangjia Lang, recently became infatuated with her beauty and asked someone named Zhang to act as a matchmaker and propose marriage. Li refused and turned him away. Zhang went away resentfully and informed Jinquan of the situation. Zhang Jinquan became enraged out of shame and gathered more than twenty accomplices the night before, openly carrying weapons and acting like robbers. They went to Li's house, broke down the door, and rushed in. At that time, the entire Li family was already asleep. They woke up with the noise but were unable to resist. The group dragged Jinmei out of her bed, forcibly abducted her, and made her kowtow to Zhang Jinquan to hastily complete the marriage. The girl had no choice but to let them have their way, only able to weep silently. Later, Li Qiushui reported the incident to the pseudo-police station and requested an investigation, but the pseudo-police station refused to accept the case.</p>

<p>In 1929 and 1934, the Commercial Press successively compiled and printed the first and second collections of the Complete Library, contributing a complete library of books to society. Thousands of basic libraries in China and abroad were established using this library. Since the outbreak of the war, cultural facilities have been largely destroyed. The people in the rear and emerging schools are in urgent need of reference books. The press, feeling that it is essential to provide cultural sustenance during this extraordinary period, has selected 500 of the most needed books from the first and second collections of the Complete Library and reorganized them into a complete system, maintaining the spirit of the original library while adapting to current needs even more. The entire compilation consists of 1,200 volumes, printed at the press's Shanghai and Hong Kong factories. 300 volumes have already been published. The Shanghai distribution center of the press is now taking pre-sale reservations. It is said that the price is 260 yuan, only one-fifth of the price of the first and second collections, in order to reduce the burden on purchasers. In addition to the already published portion, those who pre-order can receive them immediately. The remaining books are scheduled to be completed within four months, so that those who subscribe to the abridged edition can establish a concise small library in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Finance: Foreign Exchange News Favors Sellers; British and American Exchange Rates Slightly Ease <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw no change in the HSBC official rate. The black market rates for British and American currencies showed a slight easing trend. However, foreign firms continued to absorb forward contracts, and market rumors were unsubstantiated. Consequently, many who had profited in February were willing to sell during this period of consolidation. Moreover, Hong Kong Electric continued to release funds, and although HSBC absorbed spot currency, it was willing to supply forward contracts. As a result, a squeeze play ultimately emerged. The initial rates were flat, at 4 pence 1/15625 and 6.875 yuan. Shortly after, foreign firms suddenly settled some contracts, but fortunately, foreign banks such as Mercantile Bank were willing to supply currency, causing only a slight softening. The American exchange rate could be settled at 6.84375 yuan. Later, Hong Kong Electric suddenly dumped currency, and Chinese banks and speculators followed suit, coupled with negative rumors in the market, causing a sharp hardening to 4 pence 203125 and 6.9375 yuan. However, Sassoon quickly moved in to absorb currency, and foreign firms continued to purchase, causing a subsequent softening. However, as Chinese merchants had made significant profits, they came back to sell, leading to a slight hardening again. In the afternoon, due to selling by the Tianjin gang and dumping by foreign banks such as Banque Belge pour l'Étranger, the rate briefly hardened to 4 pence 234375 and 7.03125 yuan. Later, a Japanese textile mill wanted to take delivery of forward sterling, and foreign firms continued to settle contracts, so the closing rates were 4 pence 203125 and 6.96875 yuan, with the British pound down 0.0625 and the American dollar up 0.09375 compared to last weekend. The potential trend of futures was no different from spot rates.</p>
<p>Triggering a Selling Spree Among Chinese Merchants</p>
<p>In the morning, due to the London market being closed for Bank Holiday, and the American bank rate and price of pure gold being unavailable, exchange rates for British, American, and French currencies were flat. The rate against Shanghai narrowed by 0.0625. The American rate against the British pound fell by 0.125. The rates against Shanghai and French currencies were flat. The Central Bank's official rates for various currencies remained unchanged. The morning opening spot selling rates for banks were 4 shillings and 25625 pence for British gold and 6.875 yuan for the American dollar, with no change compared to last Saturday. After the opening, although foreign firms were absorbing currency, foreign banks such as Mercantile Bank were willing to supply, so there was not much impact. It was estimated that Mercantile Bank settled American currency for March at 6.75 yuan. At that time, the spot price showed a slightly soft trend, with the American dollar only settling at 6.84375 yuan. Fortunately, Hong Kong Electric immediately released currency, and pharmaceutical companies followed suit to sell. A small number of Chinese merchants also triggered a selling spree, so the market suddenly turned hard. It was estimated that Hong Kong Electric sold spot British gold to foreign banks at 4 shillings 1875 pence, and Chinese banks sold spot American currency to HSBC at 6.90625 yuan. HSBC's official rates were announced as unchanged. The silver balancing tax was also announced with no increase or decrease. After this, a certain rumor occurred in the market regarding a certain country, so the market situation continued to harden. It was estimated that Chinese merchants sold American currency for this month to foreign banks at 6.90625 yuan. At that time, the spot price hardened to 31115 pence and 6.9375 yuan. Unexpectedly, Sassoon suddenly moved in to absorb currency, and foreign firms resumed settling forward American currency, so the market sentiment slightly tightened. It was estimated that Sassoon purchased spot British gold from foreign banks at 4 shillings 1875 pence, and foreign firms absorbed American currency for April from HSBC at 6.65625 yuan. Afterwards, it stabilized for a while. Around 11:00 AM, Chinese merchants continued to release their profits, causing the trend to soften again. It was estimated that Chinese merchants sold American currency for March to foreign banks at 6.875 yuan, and American currency for this month at 6.9375 yuan. By the close, British gold was quoted at 203125 pence, and the American dollar was at 6.9375 yuan, compared to the morning opening, the British pound was down 0.046875, and the American dollar was up 0.065.</p>
<p>Tianjin Gang Liquidates Long Positions</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened slightly harder, at 4 pence 11875 and 6.96825 yuan. Subsequently, the Tianjin gang continued to liquidate long positions, and foreign firms and Chinese firms dumped currency, so it continued to soften and harden. It was estimated that the Tianjin gang dumped spot American currency to foreign banks at 7 yuan and 7.03125 yuan, and Banque Belge pour l'Étranger sold spot American currency to counterparts at 7 yuan. At that time, the spot British gold also hardened to 4 pence 234375. Unexpectedly, at that time, a Japanese textile mill suddenly limited the purchase of British gold for April at 4 pence 125, but due to a lack of willingness to supply from foreign banks, the market situation softened. It was estimated that foreign firms absorbed American currency for March from foreign banks at 6.875 yuan. Around 3:00 PM, the spot price softened to 4 pence 203125 and 6.9375 yuan.

<p>The cash smelted raw gold black market situation yesterday reversed the upward trend of the previous weekend, suddenly turning into a downward wind. Because the exchange market slightly recovered, and there were some negative rumors again in the market, people's hearts suddenly turned. Many profit-taking households came out to sell, and the Hong Kong gang's appetite was weak. Although the Tianjin gang occasionally dragged in, the chips were ultimately filled, and the result fell by more than 100 yuan. The morning opening was a sharp decline of 30 yuan, to 4830 yuan. Soon, some money exchange industries and others competed to sell vigorously, and at that time, the exchange market showed weakness, and there were negative rumors in the market, so it fell by another 50 yuan.

Securities firms released 50 taels to the money exchange industry, for 4750 yuan as the noon closing price.

Then, another securities firm suddenly released on behalf of its own firm, and there was no appetite from customers, so it decreased by another 45 yuan.

<h3 id="e99">Stock Speculation: Still Feverish <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Rubber Stock Trading Quiet</p>
<p>Xin An Jun Strongly Advocates Rising</p>
<p>Since the fever of stock speculation, the newspaper has received a letter from Xin Wei Jun, strongly advocating the advantages and disadvantages, and giving a head-on warning to speculators (see this newspaper on the 13th of this month). This was followed by a contribution from Jian Ying Jun to create resonance (see this newspaper on the 15th of this month). Readers will have a fair opinion on how the two gentlemen's opinions and the reasons and their influence. If there is no opening of Hongkou to increase assistance to speculators, various foreign stocks will be as quiet as rubber stocks. Yesterday, another manuscript was received from Xin An Jun, strongly advocating that the rise of rubber stocks is still the beginning, and the future seems to be unlimited. However, the reason why this newspaper can gain the trust of readers is because it is unbiased and impartial, and the position is fair, and the village materials are selected from an objective aspect to contribute to readers, so that readers can use their intelligence and knowledge to make judgments on both positive and negative aspects. Therefore, since Xin Wei Jun's reason for "Wei" has been disclosed, Xin An Jun's reason for "An" should also be shared with readers, and readers will be able to clearly distinguish between right and wrong. It is said that speculation cannot be compared with investment. The current use of stocks for speculation is not for investment, and the result of crazy price increases and hard support will inevitably show one day.</p>
<p>Xin An Jun's full text is very long, and due to the limitation of the length of the article, only key points can be disclosed. His reasons are that "(1) All commodities are seeing daily price increases. Although stocks themselves are not commodities, their nature represents the assets of a company (including movable and immovable property, products, raw materials, and inventory). There is no reason why all commodities should rise, but stocks alone should not rise. The purchasing power of the legal tender is now three-quarters lower than before August 13, and the value of various stocks and grains has only increased by three or four times. This is not an increase in the stock itself, but only a slight benefit to the value of the exchange of the legal tender. (2) Before the outbreak of the European war in September of last year, the price of raw rubber was only one jiao per pound in Singapore currency. Recently, the selling price per pound has reached 3.8 Singapore dollars. Due to the good market prices, most rubber companies have already thrown out their products at this price for futures, and some have also thrown out to the September period of this year. Their production costs have not increased, and the value of the goods has increased by more than two times. Therefore, some people predict that the dividends issued by various rubber companies in 1940 will be at least twice as much as those issued last year, and the value of the stock should naturally also increase by one time. Furthermore, the exchange rate from Singapore currency to Shanghai, converted into legal tender, was previously 1.5 yuan in legal tender per Singapore dollar, and is now 6.5 yuan in legal tender, an increase of more than four times compared to before. According to this calculation, those who previously issued a dividend of 1 jiao per share can issue a dividend of 2 jiao due to the company's profits of two times, and can get more than four times due to the exchange rate relationship of the legal tender. (3) In the past, Shanghai people used rubber stocks as a speculation object. After the end of the First European War in 1918, rubber stocks once plummeted, and there were many bankruptcies. Because of the serious lessons learned, they were quite cautious about investing in rubber stocks. Now the situation is slightly different. The decline in the rubber stock above was due to the fact that the price of rubber during the war was too high, the production was too much, and the demand was drastically reduced after the war. The British government suddenly ordered restrictions on planting due to overproduction, so the business of various companies was immediately suspended. This time, the war has restarted, and although the demand for rubber has increased sharply again, the British government has only relaxed the rubber production from 65% to 80%, and has not reached the extreme, so there is no excess. And during the First European War, the selling price of rubber was more than 3 shillings per pound. This time, the selling price of rubber has only risen to more than 1 shilling."</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market of Zhongye Company had an unprecedented rise. The industrial stocks mostly found new highs. There were many sellers who continued to sell, but they still closed at the highest peak. The most noteworthy ones were Shanghai Yin Company, British United Shipyard (that is, the new shares issued after the merger of Yesson and Ruiyong companies), Public Bus, Steel Industry, Xiangtai Timber, and Ewo Cotton Mill. Rubber stocks were slightly quiet due to the large-scale activity of industrial stocks, and only turned firm slightly until the closing.</p>

<p>After the rice market grain rebounded, people's hearts were already empty. Regardless of the thickness of the local source of glutinous rice, such as the Kunshan Qingjiao area, those transferred from Hongkou were quite numerous, with 45,000 bags, causing the general passengers to dare not rush in again. The hoarders are even planning to return. For a time, passengers and return goods flooded, and the plan of selling cheap rice will be implemented soon, and the authorities in the settlement have expressed their sanctions, so many floating households are empty-hearted and return, and the market is full of selling air. Xiaojiao opened at 55 yuan and 7 jiao, and then continued to be small 1 jiao, and the market of each goods decreased step by step. If No. 1 Saigon closed at 49 yuan and 8 jiao, No. 2 at 48 yuan, new at 47 yuan and 2 jiao, Huowen around 48 yuan, Tokyo at 434 yuan, broken rice high at 38 yuan, and at 36 yuan, Xiaojiao 46 yuan, Dajiao 45 yuan, next to 423 yuan. Compared with the market yesterday, it also fell 67 jiao or so. Other white yuan sales were sluggish, and it was estimated that it was worth a few yuan. Liyang special yuan was sold for 46 yuan, Danyang goods were 4114 yuan, Hong Kong white yuan was 445 yuan, Tokyo white yuan was 42 yuan and a half, and 42 yuan. As for thin glutinous rice and other national rice, there is no official market price, and they mostly belong to the black market transaction. At this time of fatigue, how can they be unique? Sales are also turning sluggish, and prices have depreciated by about 1 yuan. It is said that Kunxi glutinous rice sells for 54 yuan, and Qingsi thin rice is 512 yuan.</p>
<p>The city's rice prices continue to soar, but the source of foreign rice is unusually surging. The day before yesterday (Sunday), Jardine Matheson's Ming Sheng wheel brought 15,638 bags from Hong Kong. The company's Ding Sheng wheel also arrived in Shanghai on the same day, also bringing 7,070 bags from Hong Kong. Also, Swire Company's Jiangsu wheel also arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (19th), transporting 7,694 bags from Haiphong, and 4,944 bags from Hong Kong. The day before yesterday, a total of 35,346 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. (Ancestor)</p>

<p>Fufeng Supplies Two-Thirds</p>
<p>Fuxin Supplies One-Third</p>
<p>The flour market yesterday showed a slight easing, due to the Fuxin and Fufeng factories accepting the authorities' advice to openly sell at reduced prices. Starting yesterday, 27 flour shops within the two concessions were designated to be responsible for selling at reduced prices for one month. The Fufeng factory provides a larger quantity, supplying 5,000 bags of Lao Che Pai flour daily, and the Fuxin factory supplies 2,500 bags of Fuxin brand flour. All shops uniformly retail at ten dollars and thirty cents. Thus, the factories' commitment to maintaining the people's livelihood has been publicly demonstrated. With a designated allocation of 7,500 bags to this street, other transactions have naturally quieted down. The factories still restrict sales to outside customers, and demand from outside customers is also weak. Recycled goods are expensive, and new囤户 have become less eager. Those holding orders are not hoarding as much as they were in the previous two days. It is said that the current selling price of Che Chuan Pai warehouse receipts is still sixteen to fifteen dollars and fifty cents. Today, 32,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>The wheat market yesterday reverted to a state of stagnation, due to prices increasing daily after opening at twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents at the end of last week. Factories are trying to suppress prices for procurement, resulting in no transactions.</p>

<p>Over Six Thousand Six Hundred Pieces Arrive</p>
<p>Shantou honey oranges were quite expensive at the end of the year, but prices have gradually stabilized since the New Year. It is said that the price at the origin is quite low, but they must be shipped via Hong Kong and then to Shanghai. Moreover, on-the-spot exorbitant taxes and levies are no less than the conditions in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. As a result, the supply is slightly scarce, and orange prices are relatively high. However, yesterday 6,683 pieces of honey oranges arrived, and the people of Shanghai can once again enjoy a feast.</p>

<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the situation has softened again. This is due to the relaxation of foreign exchange, with many bears settling their positions. At the same time, short sellers have returned to increase their positions, leading to a lack of confidence and a weakening of the market. Buyers are scarce. In fact, the previous surge was too violent, and the reaction is naturally strong. However, the recent changes have been rapid, and the future lacks certainty. Nonetheless, large players are still inclined to buy.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning with news of a loosening of foreign exchange, but buyers were scarce. Bulls were actively selling, and there was a loosening of chips in the market. Those who were scalping were again inclined to sell, causing temporary confusion in the market. Twenty-count Double Horse yarn opened at 842 yuan, but immediately fell to 828 yuan. Later, major players in the industry returned to buy, and the price gradually rose back to 834 yuan, closing unchanged. The total trading volume for half a day was 2,025 bales. The price of twenty-count Double Horse yarn fell by 11 yuan. Yesterday, 135 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin, and today 140 pieces were shipped. The breakdown of the quantities bought by various groups is as follows:</p>

<p>The cotton trade is slightly dull, but although the yarn market continues to decline, the price of thick cotton, which is closely related, has not been affected. Tongzhou cotton is still selling for 201 to 203 yuan. According to industry insiders, those holding goods are still reluctant to sell much, due to the low cotton inventory. Therefore, the yarn and cotton markets are moving in opposite directions. There were 817 bales of Tonghua cotton from northern Jiangsu. The current cotton situation is listed below:</p>
<p>American firm Hengyang 行 purchased a large amount of Hua 棉 in Zhejiang, and two batches have already been shipped. Yesterday, a third batch of 8,995 bales also arrived in Shanghai, transported by the Taikoo Shipping Company's Chengdu轮. It arrived at the port yesterday morning and is docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession. Unloading is scheduled to begin today. (Year)</p>
<p>Another report on foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market was relatively quiet at the beginning, but later, due to the strength of Wall Street stock prices and short covering, the market closed stable, up two to four pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell slightly by one or two rupees. The Egyptian market was closed.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton trade was again dull yesterday due to the weakness of yarn prices, and industry sentiment was relatively weak. Therefore, market trading was quite quiet. Factories showed little interest in purchasing. No large transactions by Japanese manufacturers have been heard of. The following are the factory delivery prices converted from the US dollar exchange rate of 6.9375 yuan yesterday:</p>

<p>Yesterday, sentiment in the oil market was affected by the decline in gold prices and sluggish sales. Buyers retreated, and the bullish market created by manipulators collapsed. General囤户 are eager to sell, and are cutting prices to attract buyers. As a result, soybean oil prices plunged by six yuan, and peanut oil also fell by five yuan. A total of 120 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded at 117 yuan, with delivery in two or three days, but were only offered at 115 yuan. There were 200 pieces of Jiaozhou oil at 81 yuan, 300 pieces of Qingqi oil at 83 yuan, 40 barrels of Bengbu oil at 113 yuan, and 30 barrels of Qingdao peanut oil at 120 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was supported by囤户, but there was a lack of actual buyers, and trading volume decreased sharply. Only one transaction of 500 bags of Jia Zhou soybeans was made at 29.7 to 30 yuan, and 600 bags of Chongming 沙黄 soybeans were traded at 28.8 to 29 yuan. Therefore, the market has already declined slightly, and the overall market sentiment may become looser.</p>

<p>The cotton cloth market has been surging recently due to speculative manipulation, but actual sales are sluggish. Yesterday, with the sharp drop in gold prices, cloth market囤户 are eager to sell, and the market has suddenly turned downward. However, buyers are scarce. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth are stagnant, and hidden discounts are common. White goods, fine cloth, twill, and coarse cloth have fallen by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. Around 100 cases of bleached and dyed printed cloth were traded in this street. The Guangdong and Hong Kong帮 are better, trading more than 200 pieces of material patterned, color cloth, and printed cloth. The Zhejiang Dongjian 台帮 traded nearly 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and twill. The Beilu Yan Jin帮 traded more than 2,000 pieces of blue cloth, silk poplin, and printed cloth.

<p>White coal prices are frequently rising due to strong demand from street customers. Buyers, with limited inventory, are hoarding and raising prices, leading to market chaos and inconsistent prices. Yitai Xing Hongji white coal is priced at 160 yuan per ton, and small pieces at 155 yuan, with few transactions. Nanyang disk prices have increased by 20 yuan per ton. Fellow traders limit sales to warehouse receipts and spot cars. Therefore, the shops on this street are all raising prices significantly. Hongji screened lumps are priced at 200 yuan per ton, and small pieces at 190 yuan, delivered to customers' homes, including handling fees.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Juvenile Court <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>According to reliable reports, since August 13th, juvenile crime cases in Shanghai have increased by 30% (in direct proportion to the soaring prices!). These crimes do not occur because these children are born with criminal tendencies, but because of the pressure of hunger and poverty.</p>
<p>They don't have the habit of not committing crimes. They don't know what safety is. Only the speed of their legs and the alertness of their eyes can make them safe. They don't think charity organizations are very reasonable, because philanthropists don't help them actively fight for life.</p>
<p>In the court records, you can see that a sixteen-year-old child has committed six cases. What can we, the lucky ones in this society, say about this fact?</p>
<p>It is meaningless to convict and imprison these children, and it will not solve the problem. We must learn from European and American countries, create a juvenile court, and have judges who understand child psychology to hear these cases. We must also investigate the root causes of these children's crimes and provide practical assistance according to their individual needs.</p>
<p>To effectively solve the problem of juvenile crime, we must have a juvenile court.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Children's Club <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Qianyou</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the number of children wandering on the streets is truly countless. These innocent and lively children have lost the care of their parents at a young age and wandered onto the streets, without good food or warm clothing. They can be considered extremely miserable. Furthermore, without anyone to guide and educate them and put them on the right track, they are like lost lambs. For the sake of food and clothing, they often commit various criminal acts, such as theft. If they are small thieves today, they will be big robbers tomorrow. If people in society do not find a way to save them, these children can be said to be the gangsters of tomorrow's society. Recently, the US government, seeing this situation, established the "American Children's Club" in New York City.</p>
<p>The American Children's Club is run by a criminologist named Peizizhe. Mr. Peizizhe is already fifty-five years old. From his long experience in managing prisons, he came to a conclusion about the problem of crime: "Prisons cannot cure crime. The best prisons can only turn half of the people in prison into good citizens. The best way to reduce the occurrence of crime is to save some homeless children. A child's future good or bad is based on what they do in their spare time.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, this "Children's Club" was founded. All the facilities are designed to cater to the psychology of children, such as gymnasiums, swimming pools, art rooms, and shops. In this way, children have the most suitable place to play and relax in their spare time.</p>
<p>I hope that in the near future, a "Children's Club" like this will also be established in Shanghai to accommodate a group of homeless children, teach and train them, and use their strength to do various things that are beneficial to society. In this way, society will increase good citizens, and the country will increase useful talents.</p>

<p>— Pu Ming</p>
<p>If a prophet had told me ten years ago: Your life will be ordinary. Perhaps from childhood to now, I would not have made so many beautiful dreams.</p>
<p>Four or five years ago, sitting in the last row of the classroom, the teacher's explanations never interested me. New nouns were regarded as dung, and I looked up at the sky outside the window all day long, yearning for many bizarre stories.</p>
<p>Life gradually became monotonous, only my reverie was like a torrent of flowing water. I thought of things beyond this world, and sought only in the mysterious.</p>
<p>I didn't like people calling my name, I didn't want them to know me, I looked at the world with half-closed eyes, only loneliness comforted me, and my singing became obscure and stiff!</p>
<p>So, I became a superman. I didn't talk much, I only loved to meditate quietly. Seeing the joy of others, I felt disgusted. I ridiculed them as low-level pleasures, and I thought that everything beautiful in the world was worthless.</p>
<p>I was also unwilling to listen to others' complaints and cries. I said that this was their own fault, the result of their deep involvement in society.</p>
<p>Turning everything around me into insignificance, I was tirelessly searching for a non-existent world.</p>
<p>In a few years, I walked alone, but the waves of life gave me unexpected blows, turning my delusions into light smoke.</p>
<p>Because I tasted some bitterness, I returned to this world.</p>
<p>Now, I listen to the words of a poet, I want to walk through the cities scattered with filth and corruption and the countryside that no footprints reach, and no longer look at the sky or the walls with a melancholy tilt of my neck to dream. What I want to care about are the affairs of the world.</p>

<p>Carl Laemmle, a pioneer of the American film industry, once met a German exile named Leo Katz in Switzerland. He invented a method of steaming canned food. He put an ordinary can of food in a larger can, and put some chemicals in the interlayer between the two cans. When you want to eat it, make a few small holes in the can, and these chemicals will react and generate heat, steaming the canned food inside.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Colonel House and the First European War <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Li Shaozhong</p>
<p>US President Roosevelt recently sent Under Secretary of State Welles to Europe as the President's personal representative, which has attracted close attention from authorities in all countries around the world. Many commentators in various countries compare Welles's trip to the trip of the late US President Wilson's Colonel House to Europe during the last European War. However, the result of Colonel House's engagement in Europe at that time not only failed to restore peace, but also dragged the United States into the war. What the result of Welles's trip to Europe will be is certainly also worth paying attention to. Now let us introduce Colonel House to the readers.</p>
<p>Colonel House was born on July 26, 1858, in Houston, Texas, in the southern United States. His father had been from England since he was a child, and later participated in the "independence" revolution in which Texas seceded from Mexico and merged into the United States, making considerable contributions. Colonel House received a good education from an early age and graduated from the famous American university "Cornell University" in 1879. He returned to his hometown of Texas the following year. Since then, he lived in Texas for more than 30 years, working in farming. But his main interest was still in public affairs. Between 1894 and 1904, he held great political influence in Texas. However, he consistently refused to formally step onto the political stage himself, so he never ran for office. He preferred to be a close advisor to the state authorities while remaining in the opposition.</p>
<p>In 1912, he worked very hard in the movement to recommend Wilson as a presidential candidate. Wilson was eventually elected, and he deserves a lot of credit for this. Therefore, when Wilson came to power, he asked him to choose any position in the cabinet himself, but he still maintained his consistent style and refused to accept any official title. However, his relationship with President Wilson, whether politically or personally, was far beyond that of any cabinet minister. Even when the President chose cabinet members, a large part of it was based on Colonel House's recommendation. Furthermore, when the President and cabinet members encountered legislative or administrative difficulties, they often sought instruction from House, because Colonel House not only had a lot of experience with people, but also often had unique and insightful opinions on the implementation of politics. President Wilson said that House was his "Independent self."</p>
<p>House had a great interest in diplomacy. Because he was often close to American ambassadors abroad and often close to major European politicians, and because President Wilson trusted him, he had a significant influence on the direction of US foreign policy decisions.</p>
<p>In the spring of 1924, before the outbreak of the First European War, he knew the serious danger of the European situation and specially set off for Europe to make suggestions to Britain and Germany, expressing that the United States was willing to work hard to adjust the relationship between Britain and Germany to avoid war. He held talks with senior German officials in Berlin and also held a meeting with the German Emperor. Later, William II said: "Colonel House's visits to Berlin and London could have prevented this World War from happening."</p>
<p>After returning to the United States from Europe, Colonel House maintained close contact with the ambassadors of Britain and Germany, which made the relationship between the United States and both belligerent countries in Europe very harmonious in the early stages of the European War. In January 1915, President Wilson sent him to Europe as the President's personal representative to conduct on-the-spot research on the question of whether the United States could mediate the war under the current situation. After visiting London, Berlin, and Paris, Colonel House suggested using the principle of "freedom of the seas" as the first step in a compromise; however, the sinking of the "Lusitania" shattered all hopes of success. The following year, Colonel House was sent to Europe again to make a final effort for peace in Europe. However, despite his excellent political skills and the strong national power behind him, Colonel House's "bitter heart" and earnest advice ultimately failed to save the European situation from collapse, and the United States itself could not avoid being dragged into the vortex of the Great War.</p>
<h3 id="e116">The Wives of German Dignitaries <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Degang</p>
<p>It is said that Germans treat their wives with more respect than any other country. Gentlemen invariably protect their wives. This is something that Germans often pride themselves on.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the outbreak of the European War, Air Minister General Göring has asked his wife to go to Switzerland to recuperate from illness. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's wife also went to Brazil for a long voyage at her husband's request. Propaganda Minister Goebbels' wife and Mrs. Neues also ran to Switzerland to become expatriates. The wife of German secret police chief Himmler had been traveling and playing in Italy before the war. It is said that she has a strong interest in traveling, so she does not intend to return immediately.</p>
<p>These wives of German dignitaries are all enjoying themselves abroad. Naturally, they enjoy the special privileges of respect and protection that their husbands give them. It is a pity that most German women not only do not enjoy this blessing, but also suffer the infinite pain caused by the war created by Führer Hitler!</p>

<h3 id="e117">A Generation of 红伶 - Fragrant 消玉殒 - Zhang Weny艷's Various Aspects <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Bingjiu</p>
<p>Zhang Weny艷 was the most famous among the early female actors in the South. More than 20 years ago, she was very famous. Enthusiasts crowned her as Prince Weny艷, as the foremost female lead. After marrying Yuan, she stopped singing, lived in seclusion, and rarely interacted with the outside world. Time flies, 20 years in a blink of an eye. Last winter, she suddenly suffered from kidney disease, lingered in bed for several months, medicine was ineffective, doctors were helpless. She finally passed away on Lunar New Year's Eve, at the age of only 42. A generation of artists passed away, looking back on the past, I feel even more emotional. Therefore, based on what I know, I write this to tell those who care about the opera.</p>
<p>Family Background</p>
<p>Weny艷 was from Zhenjiang. Her father's name was Zhang Xiqing, a tailor. His family was poor and could not support themselves. A friend who was learning to be an actor persuaded his daughter to enter the opera. Zhang was in trouble at that time, and the discussion was successful. Weny艷 had an older sister named Wen Kui, who was four or five years older than Weny艷. She graduated early and became famous in the opera. When Weny艷 first came on stage, her acting skills were immature. People thought she was too simple and natural, cute and interesting, so they loved her with the same heart as they loved Wen Kui. The two singers were like nightingales, and I don't know how many children of noble families were fascinated. Before long, Wen Kui was appreciated by a Mr. Ruan, who rewarded her with a lot of money and hid her in a golden house. Mr. Ruan was a giant in the egg business, with tens of thousands of assets. After marrying Wen Kui, his family fortunes suddenly declined. Wen Kui was calm and worried, and did all the housework herself, just like a good family woman. The following year, Wen Kui died of illness. Weny艷 cried bitterly, which made her even more motivated to work hard on her career. She enjoyed her fame for seven or eight years without declining. Later, she was hired by Mr. Yuan, and then she stopped singing. Her younger brother, Zhang Baiyun, is currently a screenwriter at the Great Theater, and he is also a talented person in the opera world.</p>
<p>Artistic Achievements</p>
<p>Weny艷 was a skilled in the role of 花旦, and her acting was unrestrained and thorough. Although she was not exceptionally beautiful, she was radiant and energetic when she was dressed up on stage, and she was exceptionally charming. She seemed drunk, her voice was soft, but her inner strength was weak. She was good at small movements and eye expressions. Her performances in "Wandering Lake Boat", "Spinning Cotton", "Playing Flowers", and "Checking Touguan" were full of flirtatious sounds and delicate cries. The audience was fascinated by her great magic, and those who supported her gave her the title of prince, as if she was a lover of music.</p>

<p>Large-Scale Production of All Dream of the Red Chamber Films</p>
<p>Will Hold Public Exhibition After Completion</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year before last, Xinhua Company transformed its film studio, Lilac Garden, into a model of West Lake and held a "West Lake Expo": At that time, it caused a sensation among many tourists who came to watch the "West Lake" scenery. Recently, under the planning of Zhang Shankun, there is another large-scale reconstruction of the "Grand View Garden", which will be held soon during the spring season.</p>
<p>The various scenes described in the novel Dream of the Red Chamber are something that most people have "yearned for" for a long time. Xinhua has now decided to invest 100,000 yuan to mobilize all the set designers to build the garden, which covers dozens of acres, on a large scale according to the Dream of the Red Chamber atlas. All kinds of scenery such as pavilions and towers in the Red Mansion are all available here, and everything is complete.</p>
<p>The motive for this plan is to prepare to gather talents and produce a complete series of long-length ancient costume films of Dream of the Red Chamber on a large scale. Therefore, it has been decided to give Xianghua Country a coat of ancient costumes, and all the sets will be built, so that the Red Mansion movie can be held as a "West Lake Expo". Public exhibition of "Grand View Garden".</p>
<p>The characters in Dream of the Red Chamber, from the Twelve Beauties down, are unusually large in number, both male and female, and it is originally a difficult to produce blockbuster. In addition to signing Chen Yun裳, Cheng君, Yuan Meiyun, Chen Yanyan...... and other outstanding talents to participate, Xinhua will also make full details in other aspects; therefore, the garden is gorgeous, different from ordinary, and will release an absolutely great difference under the current prevalence of ancient costume films.</p>
<p>Now, the "Grand View Garden" has been drawn and designed by experts, and construction will begin on a large scale in the shortest possible time; because it is limited to the late spring period, it must be fully completed and a public exhibition will be held.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Thoughts After Seeing a Qi School Opera Performance (Part 1) <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>It's been several years since I last saw Zhou Zhifang, the leader of the Qi school, perform. A few days ago, Mr. Jin invited me to the Carlton to see him perform "The Honest Official's Register." After buying the ticket and settling down, the play "Bumping the Tablet" was already being performed on stage. Gao Baisui played Yang Linggong, his voice was very broad and bright, but his singing style was not very delicate. After a few minutes of intermission, the performance resumed. Zhou Xinfang, playing Kou Zhun, came on stage, speaking in a rough voice. Xinfang wore a gauze hat and an official's robe, his attire was extremely proper. Furthermore, he had skill in his legs; the way he walked casually was pleasing to the eye, truly different from the others. When he was transferred to the capital and lived in the official residence, he sang the "Five Watches" very loudly, with a tune that was not low, reaching the proper key. It was a pity that whenever he reached a high note, he inevitably exerted himself and had the problem of swallowing tones and omitting words. (Singers whose voices are not high enough, stop singing when they encounter a high note, and resume singing when they reach a low note, which is called "eating words.") Because of his old reputation, people forgave him and showed no dissatisfaction at all. Fortunately, the people who came to the Carlton to see the Yifeng Drama Society were focused on watching and not listening, so a few small flaws in the singing were not a problem at all. That aside, Xinfang's acting definitely had its own characteristics. For example, in the scene where the Eight Thousand Year Old Bestows a Horse, except for the line he sang while kneeling on the ground, which was long and slow and did not sound good at all, all the other acting expressions were delicate and subtle. When he laughed triumphantly, he was scolded by the eunuch, and he suddenly showed a look of shock and fear, shrinking his head down and holding the horsewhip behind his back. This one gesture can be described as a stroke of genius.</p>
