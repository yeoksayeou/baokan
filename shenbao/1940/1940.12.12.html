<p>十一月三十日在阿文件簽字之後、世界輿情旣指爲這一慕毫無新意義可言·但在外觀上儼然是日本「結束中國事變」的一種姿態，則由邏輯上推想，接踵而來的節目，當爲南進的發動以至和民治國家衝突。然而事有出人意外的，日外相松岡却於本月九日發布其就職以來的首决談話；雖然並未根本吾認南進意圖及美日間的小安情勢，而其態度的含蓄，語氣的委婉，殊爲邇來日方外交辭令所罕見：其重申日本在東亞無領土野心以及日方對於三國盟的所負義務的新解釋，允足刺激視聽，似乎由松岡所表示的日政府態度，並不如世人懸揣之甚。據十日的美京消息，彼方對此已有不同的反應；據說松岡此一談話並未能和緩美國對於日本所造成的太平洋難題而採的堅決態度；而另一報道則謂松岡所表示日本對於盟的義務的伸縮性、以及對於荷印要求的「和平性質」，已引發若干樂觀。綜合觀之，大槪美當局態度並未因而有所動搖、而一般觀感則多少減輕了一些憂懼。當然，這種氣象不會對於遠東局勢發生決定的影響，但至少也是一個新波動。</p>
<p>欲求瞭解日本政治動向，一定要注意其全部關聯與歷史發展，絕不　憑其片段的表示以爲論斷。是以目前首先需要明瞭松岡談話的性質究竟代表着日本整個政策，抑或僅是他自己與一部政府當局的見解。一年以前，日外相野村曾以準備開放長江的意旨通知美國，也邀取了一部分美人的好感，但在日本國內却大受責難，甚至形成阿部內閣傾圯原因之一；那一經騐，是不應輕易忘却的。松岡個人雖號稱親軍派，但他就任外相之後，允其在三國締盟引起美國責難之後，他的外交路錢，不只不與所謂革新份子相合拍，反而正是循着日本舊日外交傳統的途徑。試以近兩月松岡態度與日方右翼新聞論調相對照，當不難發現其間的重大紛歧；就是在松岡發表此一談話而後，國民新聞的攻擊美國仍舊有加無已，這一事實，不容忽略。當近衛再度登臺之初，確亦相當具有爲軍政各方所一致支持的聲勢，但是隨着客觀局勢的發展，聲勢已日見薄弱，甚至連內閣本身地位都頗見動搖，其一再補充閣僚並援引平沼入閣可資明證。近衛松岡一方旣與極端主張者相結託，其保守色彩又日益加重，這種情勢顯非軍部右翼與所謂革新政客所樂見；因此亦可見松岡此一力求美日諒解的企圖，至多只是保守陣營的一種期望，同時也就是近衛內閣前途所寄託；但另一方面，却隱隱有一個與此相牴牾的重大勢力存在。松岡之指斥美日戰爭爲愚蠢，固頗娓娓動聽，而那種愚蠢論調，在日本目前却正高唱人雲，這現象是特別値得注意的。</p>
<p>其次，如果從近十年來的日本政治演進過程來看，無論執政者是政治家抑或軍人，其面貌究係溫和抑或激烈，都具有萬變不離其宗的立塲，那便是其傳統的拓殖政策，包括着北進的大陸政策與南進的海洋政策。對於這些政策的進行，也再三再四的聲明其並無領土野心，但其實際情勢如何，世人大都耳熟能詳，再無更加絮聒的必要。以美日關係而言，從巴奈號的不幸事件而後，日方幾乎無時不在努力求美日關係的緩和，然而與之平行而實現的却是美國遠東權益的不斷被損傷與日本勢力之逐漸向南太平洋伸張。在松岡談話當中關於南進政策的解釋，曾列舉泰國馬來緬甸各地名，表示願與成立諒解，而單獨不提到菲島與越南，大槪因爲前者過於刺激美人觀感，後者則旣成事實具在，無可再加掩諱，但這兩區域，已往却都是被日本置入「共榮圈」之列前。十月四五兩日近衛松岡都發表過對美不辭一戰的談話，如果不是美國加緊禁運租援助中國，地中海的戰局又向着不利於軸心國的方向發展，恐怕此際日當局態　仍和兩月以前相同，斷不會連盟的義務都想逃避。而且關於遠東問題，邇來英國顯然更與美方立塲相同態度一致，而日本獨斤斤於緩和對美關係，對英幾乎不加理睬。這一點也是値得玩味。</p>
<p>雖然目前日當局已明白表示不願與軸心國共其休戚的態度。那其實只是一種誘惑以至變相的威脅，而且也絕不足以代表今日日方的一切。而遠東局勢的發展。也絕不僅繫於日政府一時的外交姿態，只有各關係列強的態皮以及歐戰前途的演變，纔是決定此一問題的重要因素；而覆按日本歷來所發表冠冕堂皇的外交辭令，則松岡隔昨談話，除了他主觀的希望其發生何種麻醉作用，蔚爲嶄新的一種外交攻勢之外，實際上也沒有任何新竟義可言。</p>

<p>希特勒就把張伯倫領到自己臥室，祇帶着繙譯施密特。這個房間很小，裹面祗有一架鐵床，牆上掛着一張極精緻的圖畫，從慕尼克博物院中送來，隨時更換。希特勒談話時候，眞是口若懸河，滔滔不絕，使人無從揷口，張伯倫祇好張口結舌，對他呆望。</p>
<p>張伯倫又對我說，他到戈特斯堡和希特勒第二次會面的時候，希特勒的說話還是滔滔汨汨，若決江河，他以爲像這樣的談話，卽使繼續下去，也是一無所用。况且每隔幾分鐘，卽有一個軍官進來，送呈電報－這顯是一個預定計劃。希特勒看了，便怒不可遏的大喝道：「日耳曼人所濺的血，總須報復，非把捷克人殲滅不可！」他怒火如焚，總是有增無减。不論他是眞是假，他便對繙譯說：「不如中止談話吧，我要回到旅館去了。」這旅館在萊茵河對岸，必須乘船渡河。他告退的時候，希特勒仍一路咆哮，一路送客，直到河濱，突然停止說話，立刻換上一副面容，看着脚下的河流，用極柔和的聲音對我說道：「我原想以這河上美麗的風景，指示閣下，可是現在已被霧掩沒了…」像他這樣的善於轉變，一會兒怒發如雷，一會兒溫柔風雅，倐忽之間，判若兩人，眞是見所未見。</p>
<p>一個跟隨張伯倫到德國去的外交部人員對我說，首相對於這兩决談話，隱痛在心，像希特勒這種暴跳如雷，在他一生，確是向未見過。所以有人當着他提到希特勒的名字，他就會露出一副尶尬面孔，像小孩子被逼吃蓖蔴油一樣。但是在張伯倫方面，以爲他保全和平，責無旁貸，他總希望能如願以償。</p>
<p>他從英法兩國的士女接到無數書翰，使他愈增信仰。法國成千累萬的鄉間婦女向他致函感謝，使國家得免戰禍，家庭得免轟炸，子女得免死亡。還有許多老婦，用絨綫結了手套送他，信裹邊寫着顚巍巍斗大的字說：「首相戴這手套，坐飛機時候，兩手可以不會受寒了。」凡此種種表示，使張伯倫夫人受到無限感觸。她是一個心地仁慈的女子，便力勸他丈夫堅向息事寗人一路走去</p>
<p>慕尼克會議以後，這一條妥洽路綫，卽不復爲英國人所擁護。原來英國陸空軍，都無準備，因之輿論界迫不得已，對於慕尼克會議的結果，衹好逆來順受。可是大英帝國已嘗到了苦味，也知道這件事未免有玷光榮，於是立下決心，不再俯首受辱，任何犧牲在所不顧了。一九三九年一月，我曾赴英倫迭决出席會議，足跡幾遍三島。我覺察到英國輿論，已較政府前進。英國雖亟需實行徵兵制，但政府方面猶遲疑不決，人民方面却積極有此要求了。全英各地英國人，無分男女，無分階級，都對我說：「我們決不能聽任希特勒統治歐洲，我們也一定要編成龐大的陸軍和强有力的空軍。」</p>
<p>我回到巴黎，就寫了一篇文章，說英國將在三月中實行徵兵，那時許多法國朋友，都說我是痴人說夢。他們說，義務軍役，違反英人歷代的傳統習慣，英國人決不會採取的。但在一九三九年三月，英國果然實行徵兵制了。</p>
<p>德軍侵入捷克城，張伯倫和擁護息事寗人政策的一流人物，都受着當頭一棒。這位英國首相的震駭，並非矯揉造作。他一向深信希特勒決不會併呑非日耳曼人種的，現在却獲得了一個反證。他頓時翻然改圖，一變而爲希特勒的勁敵。他羞忿交併，竟出人意外，對波蘭慨予保證。那時候我在美國，聞訊之下，就自言自語的說，「這就不免一戰了。」一方面，德國將繼續其擴張領土的野心，勢必併呑波蘭；另一方面，英國亦必如已往歷史所表現，對於親筆所簽訂的莊嚴條的，決不中道背棄。各走極端，戰爭就無法挽救了</p>
<p>英國突然置身於歐洲縱橫埤闔的局勢中，其勢不得不與法國有更密切的了解。一九三九年六月，英法同盟在巴黎舉行正式宴會，列席者有英國陸軍大臣倍立夏，法國外交部長龐納，和甘茂林將軍。倍立廈卽席宣言，一旦開戰，英軍概歸法軍統帥指揮，屆時他能够說一句「我們的甘茂林將軍，」眞是幸何如之。一言甫畢，掌聲四起，良久不絕，而甘茂林將軍却始終不動聲色。宴畢倍立廈和我們同赴波蘭大使館，那裹正在舉行跳舞會，倍立廈此行，無非表示英波兩國已有新的結合了。</p>
<p>這一次的見聞，使我每一回憶，卽不免黯然神傷。時當盛夏，夜色醉人。波蘭大使館花園中，白色大理石獅首人身像，閃耀於星光之下，音樂隊奏着華爾茲，燈光燦爛，如火如荼。草地上有許多美貌嬌娃，由波蘭和法國軍官樓抱着作婆娑之舞，德國大使兩位千金時亦在內。我們僉認戰事已迫在眉睫，波蘭將首當其衝，這一决的跳舞會，似乎與（滑鐵盧戰役前夕威　呑）在比京白魯捨爾舉行的跳舞會相彷彿吧！當晚與會士女觥籌交錯，高談闊論，都是不相干的瑣事。他們談巴斯德號的處女航，有幾個準備到南美去的人，更把他們的旅行計劃作爲談話資料</p>
<p>數日後，倍立廈又到巴黎，準備參觀七月十四日法國民主紀念日閱兵典禮，同行者尚有邱吉爾氏。那天塲面偉大，是巴黎歡樂的最後一日。法國陸軍從未有過這樣雄壯的軍容。被檢閱的有輕裝騎兵隊輕裝步兵隊，海軍陸戰隊，客籍軍和正規軍，舉凡法國光榮的事物，莫不在這次大檢閱中顯露出來。邱吉爾微笑道，「感謝上帝，法國竟有這樣的陸軍。」那時候，我們又誰料到那種士氣，軍紀，和最優秀軍隊的口碑，竟會因機械配備不足，而致英雄無用武之地呢！當時戰車蜿蜒而行，觀者莫不動容，可是他們並不明瞭德國的情形，他們又誰知道，德國的戰軍數量更多，裝甲更厚，非法國大砲所能制伏呢！</p>
<p>是日下午，倍立廈同着副官某大佐，到紐伊里見我。他告訴我編練英國陸軍所遇到的種種困難。</p>
<p>他說，「徵兵制果然很好，但現在還祇是空言而無實際。登記的雖然很多，但是一無配備，二無敎練他們的軍官，因此沒法把他們一起召集訓練。」</p>
<p>我問道，「上决大戰中的軍官們那兒去了呢？」</p>
<p>「他們不懂得運用新兵器呀！」</p>
<p>「假使戰爭就在明天爆發，你們能派遣多少師兵援助我們呢？」</p>
<p>「立刻嗎？恐怕不會超過六師吧。」</p>
<p>這個人數把我嚇了一跳。不久我得悉法國參謀部向英國所要求的，在歐戰全期內不過三十二師，更使我大爲震恐。我肥得一九一八年間，法國除有美俄義日同盟國外，英軍參戰的也有八十五師之衆，法國的獲勝，尚且還是間不容髮。這無怪要引起我的驚異了。當時外交部畏龐納的意見，也與我不謀而合。我聰他追述過下面的一件事：　（未完）戰前巴黎總統府大街盛况</p>

<p>紐約　德元首希特勒昨告德國人民、若德人獲勝、則世界卽爲德人所有、希氏在柏林兵工廠鋼台之頂所發長篇之演說、明示其對英空戰若獲勝利後之意向與目的、其淸楚爲以前各决演說所不及、希氏謂黃金將成無用與無價値之物、貴族政洽將在德國一掃而空、代之者乃勞工政治、希氏演辭之大部分、係向德國民衆保證、在戰前困苦艱難此數年中、及在希氏認爲英方轟炸累及德民衆之數月中、德人所經之辛苦與所受之犧牲、決可獲得酬報、但允有重大意義者、希氏之演說由無綫電廣播全歐、播向陷於內爭之羅國、播向曖昧不明之保國、播向恐懼戰禍之南國、並播向德國全境每一家庭、對歐陸之居民希氏告以作戰之目標、對英國則告以末日已近、過去希氏每作演說、除在慕尼黑向其老同志演說外、殆皆率領德民衆向世界各國之議會及政洽巨頭有所表示、但希氏昨日之演說確係對內而發、意欲使納粹黨之大衆知悉轟炸機之下、有名利雙收之豐富酬報、德對英作戰經年未息、其民衆自必須常予以刺激與鼓勵、俾可繼續奮鬥、然希氏允許其人民、對彼等之犧牲與努力必予以補償、則猶爲第一次也、開戰以來希氏發表聲明時、僅作虛聲恫嚇、揚言立將擊敗英國以及德國之所有敵人、但有不應忽視者、傳希氏　擬在今年八月十五日至白金漢宮進午膳、並曾告其心腹謂、渡海之事至合其嗜好之時、必將一嘗其味焉、（十一日國際電）</p>

<p>（續完）</p>
<p>吾人對國家武備之最後成功、均抱有如此堅定之信心、倘余之靜待時機得能减低犧牲、則全國定能對余表示諒解與感謝、吾人幷非爲聲勢威望而進攻、吾人有一定之軍事程序、何者先行則行之、不宜行者則避之、但吾人仍希望能有恢復理智之時、回復和平、德國在軍事及經濟上均不致戰敗、時間在與德國無害、德國必　勝利、在余之字典中無投降一字、余不畏懼鬥爭、余一息尚存誓必持續到底、</p>
<p>希特勒纔追述國社黨革命之經過情形稱、當發動國社黨革命之初、吾人有兩大目標、其一爲統一德國民族、先須達到此目的、始能實現德國生存攸關之要求、一九三二年之時、德國失業工人計八百萬人、衣食不足、死亡甚衆、國社黨爲統一德國民族奮鬥、幾經困難、初有上流社會智識階級之阻力、此非武力所能解決、當時余認淸此非恢復德國民族之社會不可、於是向所定目標邁進、其二爲驅除外國政治之壓迫、此卽凡爾賽和的是也、該項和的阻止德國民族之統一、奪去德國之殖民地、故吾人之第二目標、爲與凡爾賽和的奮鬥、烯特勒言至此、乃提出民主政治稱、英美兩國之民主政治、幾盡爲資本家所包辦、擁有無量數財產之資本家的百餘人、彼等之所謂自由、不但指獲得資本言、且寓有不受國家統制之意、各資本家咸競出報紙、爲其鼓吹政策製造輿論、幷代表各政黨、此之謂民主政治、在此自由與財產豐富之國家、有巨富之人亦有赤貧之人、此爲人所難以置信、英國階級之分極嚴、貢富對照亦極明顯、從未見其採取仟何解決辦法、統制世界財富之國家、工人之生法情形更屬不堪、國雖富盛、但失業問題亦未見其解決、卽如富有之英國、曾有失業者二百五十萬名、且數十年中、時常如此、豪富之美國、失業者常在一千萬與一千三百萬之間、法國失業者亦不下八十萬之衆、事實具在、尚何言哉、英國勞工黨員之入閣者嘗欣然曰、此决戰爭後、將從事對社會有價値之事業、英國之工人將有遊歷閒散之能力、殊不知德國早已解決此種問題矣、往往有少數之統治者內心雖自私自利、但以民治主義爲標幟、彼等深知吾人不致危害彼等之布國、所畏者、德國流行之理想若不設法擯斥、則將流入彼邦、革新人民之觀念、使其不肯帖然就範是也、總之、資本主義之世界、有一最重要之經濟法則、人生世上、務須爲工商業而勞作、至於工商業之經營、乃係爲資本家謀福利、至於國社主義則反是、民爲貴、其他一切、不過達到目的之工具耳、余本人對於厚利、並不感覺興趣、六釐息對仟何人不爲少矣、英人又曰、「吾人爲維持金本位而戰」、殊不知德人亦嘗一度擁有黃金、余掌國鈞後、因德國之內並無黃金、是以與金本位絕緣、並改變觀念、以吾人工作之能力爲黃金、吾人之馬克雖無黃金爲其後盾、而仍始終穩固者、以其勞工爲其後盾故也、</p>
<p>希特勒繼稱、凡具有廢止國社主義國家及摧毀德國民族之人、今彼等本身之開始受到敎訓、如波蘭初欲制服德國、結果在十八日之內被德征服、其决有英國侵入挪威之企圖、其後乃發生西綫大戰、吾軍實施進攻、當時吾國年老之人均疑懼參半、以爲馬奇諾防錢堅不可破、結果在六星期之內、戰事卽告結束，余對於空戰不擬實施夜襲、故在波蘭之戰時、德機未往夜襲、德國空軍作戰之目的、乃在襲擊軍事目標、不在加害平民與婦孺、所以在法國之戰時、亦未實行夜襲、但邱吉爾對德國採取無限制之空軍戰術、但結果德兵工廠未受任何損失、遭其殃者乃不幸之平民而已、世上不乏痴愚之人、以爲德國將禍起蕭牆、分崩離析、殊不知第三帝國殊非第二帝國之比、吾人爲前途而戰、爲人民全體之幸福而戰、吾人已有具體之計畫、德國人民組織之國家將益見鞏固、凡足以阻碍具有才能之人之發展者、任何障碍悉掃除之、吾人決計樹立社會主義之國家、非達到目的、決不認爲成功、彼時吾人將昭示世人、資本與勞工、孰爲眞主、希氏之結語稱、「由一無名之小卒而爲德國之領袖、較具有德國領袖之資格而謀和平、艱難多矣、志竟成、何懼之有、（十日海通社電）</p>

<p>十七世紀時、天全敎傳敎士輪入天文之史實、近人知之已稔、凡會遊故宮博物館者、必能憶及南懷仁輩所製之天文仪器、近世科學益進步、而天主敎之於科學研究、亦不讓人專美、天主敎蓋認研究科學、卽爲求眞、故宗敎與科學、實爲相得益彰、絕無絲毫衝突之可言、</p>
<p>徐家匯大文台之成立、遠在同治十二年、（一八七三）迄今已歷六十七年、其時上海萬國商會因進出船隻、常罹風災、乃請求神父P．Dechevrens設立觀象台、預測颶風、文神父立卽應允、僅要求與各處觀象台免費拍發電報而已、</p>
<p>文神父後、繼任者爲蔡神父P．Chevalliee勞神父P．Froe及現任雁神父P．Lejay目前徐家滙天文台之組織、可略述如下、台長雁神父主持一切、但以常須出外測騐地心吸力、（雁神父曾發明地心吸力測騐擺、會助中國政府作土地航測、成績絕佳、）故在台時間不多、台長之下、則有徐家滙氣象台中仟茅神父P．Dumas龍神父Pherzi及卜神父P．Burgand、分司氣候、地震、電磁、及時計等、佘山天文台衛神父P．do　Lovielemerque則專司天文、電磁部原亦設徐家滙、後上海敷設電車、於磁力發生影響、遂於光緒三年（一八七七年）以數日之力、移於菉葭濱、八一三戰事發生、復移至佘山、故今日通稱之徐家滙天文台、實包括徐家滙與佘山二處、而嚴格言之、則徐家滙爲氣象台、佘山則爲眞正之天文台、</p>
<p>徐家匯天文台之工作最主要者爲氣象報告、其决爲標準時刻及地震、氣象報告、每日公布四决、但每日收到報古、則達二百餘决以上、報告之機關、則可分陸地報告站、（如中國沿海海關報告站、國內政府報告站、國外報告站、）及海洋商船軍艦之活動報告站、陸地報告站的有五十餘處、遇有颶風、則在法租界外灘示警、六七十年來、中國沿海颶風、的共發生一千數百决軍艦商船之得免於難者、不可數計、天文台所收感謝嘉許之函件紀念品等、亦難以枚舉、已故勞神父且有「颶風之父」之稱、滙台並有新式時計儀二具、置藏處之溫度與氣壓、皆經特別設計、不能變更、故時計錯誤每日不能逾百分之一秒、每日正午及晚九時、則以無綫電播送時間、民國十五年十月、國際天文協會、並定非洲亞爾基、美國聖地亞哥、及徐家匯三處、爲標準時計處、徐家匯地震儀設立較晚、惟器極精良、有Wieehert式水平動儀、及Galitzinll二垂直動儀各一架、故徐家滙之地震研究、在全世界亦佔重要位置、已往十餘年中、以華北兩决大地震之預測、爲最重要紀錄、</p>
<p>佘山之天文台、創立於一九〇〇年、備有七米長之赤道具二具、鏡頭直徑爲四十分、一備觀望、一備攝影、佘山天文台年來有成績之工作、爲研究太陽黑點、曾攝照片一萬二千張、並曾決定一萬四千個星體之拉置、研究一千二百個雙星與羣星、而木星擾亂其他行星之軌道、亦曾計算一百餘决佘山天文台所以有此成績、卽在其望達鏡、能將四度光之星、增强全十二度光、徐家滙天文台人員、並曾作數决內地探險旅行、及長江上游之探測、共繪地圖五十四幅、並且定五十處城市之位置、民國二十六年、曾應中國政府之請、由上海携帶滙神父發明之地心吸力測騐器、至貴州測騐、其時公路多未完成、但卒能克服困難、終告成功、而近年中國新設之南通天文台、靑島天文台及中央氣象台等、或由滙台襄助、裝置建造、或由滙台訓練人員、對於中國近代科學上之貢獻、實非淺鮮、謂宗敎錮蔽思想、阻止物質文明淮步者可以悟矣、</p>

<p>俗諺有所謂「小韃子敲潮烟，」早年市上曾有泥塑一淸服，蓄短鬚，持畢烟管，作吸烟狀，以爲小兒玩具者，此可見滿洲人之盛吸烟。其在漢人中，如康熙時，海寗相國陳元龍，溧陽相國史貽直，俱以吸烟著稱，茶至爲淸聖祖所播弄也。因陳史互爲姻親，而二人又喜吸烟，聖祖惡之，卽賜以水晶烟管，二人喜甚，以爲異數，用以吸烟，烟燄直衝喉際，嗆甚，至不敢再吸。聖祖又傳禁吸烟，蔣廷錫有詩紀其事；詩云：</p>
<p>碧椀瓊槳漱灧開，</p>
<p>肆筵先已戒深杯；</p>
<p>瑤池宴罷雲屏敞，</p>
<p>不許人間烟火來。</p>
<p>可是禁者自禁，吸者自吸，但觀雍正四年制錢缺乏情形，便可知當時吸烟之風依然披靡也。</p>
<p>當時制錢每枚重一錢四分，最輕爲一錢，而銀價一兩，只可兌大錢八百四十文，融化爲銅，重的七斤有餘，用以製造銅器，可賣銀二三兩。蓋其時烟袋用者甚多，物雖微小，毀錢十文，卽可製成烟袋一具，値百文有餘，奸民可圖十倍之利，故鎔制錢作烟袋者比比。但此之所謂烟袋，尚非水烟袋，而爲旱烟袋，故只重一兩餘。然足證吸烟之人多，乃至影響及於制錢也。</p>
<p>乾隆時，朝臣中吸烟著名者，莫如紀文達公曉嵐，有紀大烟袋之稱。蓋其烟斗甚大，一斗之烟，自出寓可吸至朝房也。一日當直，正吸烟，忽聞召見，亟將烟袋插入靴筩中，趨入奏對，良久，火熾於襪，痛甚，不覺嗚咽流涕，上驚問之，則對曰：臣靴筩中走水，蓋北人謂失火爲走水也。乃急揮之出，比至門外脫靴，則烟燄班勃，肌膚焦灼矣。</p>
<p>至於當時貴族家中，如紅樓夢書中之賈宅，尚少見吸烟，只有一百零一回，薛寳釵向鳳姐兒遞了一袋烟，此一袋當然爲早烟。惟兒女英雄傳中寫的是旗人家中，故如安太太吸烟不離手，張金鳳褚大娘子亦吸烟。正見旗人最喜吸烟，而民間吸烟之風已盛。甚至有腹寗將而烟不能不吸，如武進劉文定公綸未遇時，貧至絕食，以竹烟袋乞烟草於鄰，鄰人誚之曰：「烟草消食，勿多食也。」公笑受之。蓋笑其無食而吸烟，將更飢也。</p>
<p>烟袋之製，不一其材，有純銅，純銀，象牙，烏木，紫檀，籐條，竹管之屬。但金屬之姻袋易傳熱，木質之烟袋易敲折，籐條雖豎而失之於柔，象牙雖佳而不經使用，以及銀銅等，只可製短小之烟袋，且不易吸收烟油；故早烟袋以竹爲最宜，一則取其細長，二則取其直，三則取其不易折，四則烟油易於爲管壁所吸收。大凡用竹木作烟袋者，上端之烟嘴，用銅，用牙，用料；不一致。惟下端燃烟之斗，必須用銅。蓋吸旱烟，烟嘴啣於口中，金屬固經用，但太硬，易傷齒，故以象牙爲最適宜，爲其硬之中帶有柔性。烟斗盛烟，去其餘燼，必須敲　，故雖用金屬，尚易剝蝕。舊時烟袋之上，懸一荷包；或一漆髹木質之烟鼇，用以貯烟。然最簡單之吸烟方法，用一細竹管，長只尺許，通其節，一端刻挖成一小漏斗狀以納烟。吸烟時一手持烟管，挾於將指與無名指間，撮烟絲於巨指食指間；另一手用其兩指取烟，用紙吹燃烟，（紙吹亦稱煤頭，用熟紙搓捲成條，有煤便於吹，）一吹一吸一敲，悠然自得，見者生羨，此所謂敲潮烟是也（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c63">金市轉挫 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤晤盤、一轉前昨堅穩之勢，疲風略起、因匯市晨開呈硬、引起賣風、一度撳低五千七百四十八元，嗣以外匯　平、低價搜買者遂來、且有空頭抵補，收盤前提升達五千七　七十七元、結果五千七百七十三元、比上日小十三元、現金先山余號出銀號四十兩、價比　分低九元、後銀樓出一大二十兩低十元、午後週三無市、半日交易僅二千兩、銀樓　金不動、關金等平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋跌</p>
<p>晨初最使　頭難堪、開盤竟告撳低三十餘元、計銀號對做二十兩、五千七白五十元、未幾銀號繼續對做二十兩、再跌二元、爲五千七百四十八元、一蹶不振、惟不久因聞外滙轉平、稍動買風、金號亦乘賤補進、錢兌業銀號聯袂購買、會拉高至五千七百七十七元、計銀號入錢兌業三十兩是也、以後交易散漫、午收平平、計銀號對做十兩、爲五千七百七十三元、結果軋降十三元、半日上落有二十九元、現金號之本牌金售出價、較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行仍懸五百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元光景、</p>
<h3 id="c64">外幣升降甚微 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、盤旋略低、英美金鎊因亦各降五角，英金票呆定如故、市價雖平、美金票變動至微、終比上日下落四分、香港票跌後轉　、晚市仍站四元零一分原價、日余票及朝鮮票需要甚殷、市價賡　高漲、前者高至一元五角五分半、後者升爲一元三角、</p>
<p>大通銀得減活存息</p>
<p>一月一日起實行</p>
<p>美商大通銀行、定明年一月一日起减低國幣活期儲蓄存款利息、其致存戶通函有云、「敝行爲應付現行金融情况、對於國幣儲蓄存款、覺有酌减利率之必要、故自一九四一年一月一日起、暫改爲每年週息二釐、一俟時局平穩、仍望恢復原有利率」、</p>
<p>「附註」該行存息原爲三釐半、計减一釐半、又該行自十月九日起、對於美金儲蓄戶、亦概不給息、（源）</p>
<h3 id="c65">雜糧　浮囤謀出籠　期油回跌三元　大批雜糧運港 <a href="#c65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>昨日油市、一因現貨銷塲懈淡、市價見辱、致以一半興趣、已受打擊、二則米價又鬆、黃豆市平庸乏神、人心不免浮動、一般搶帽子式之浮囤、亟謀出籠、因之賣風見盛、行情下游、結果近期比上日跌去近三元、遠期挫落二元、共計做開現貨烟歧豆油三十件、價爲七十八元五角、大有廠豆油百担、價爲八十五元、膠州新生油二百件、價爲八十三元、靑島生油八十桶、價爲一百十二元　角牛至一百十元、計十二月份交路貨大連豆油五十桶、價爲一百零八元、計十二月下靑島生油一千二百餘桶、價爲一百十三元至一百十元、計二月份交九百桶價爲一百十元二角半至一百零九</p>
<p>昨有生油三千八百廳自烟臺來、今日有豆子一千九百四十五包、豆餅一萬五千四百六十塊、花生五百六十包、生仁八百包、生油六千廳、又六百六十五件、芝蔴三白包、蔴油七百廳、均運香港、</p>

<p>證券晤盤、昨市仍未能繼續振作、買進者雖有鉅量吸收、賣戶仍不絕供給、致市價不漲反跌、可見大戶多頭已在覓路出籠、逢有大量匯胃、卽行吐出、故此前途恐一時不易興奮、大借款不斷成功、竟無補於公債之價格、一反從前、每有借款成立、必有一度興奮之常例、昨日上下午生大一家買進七十餘萬、大華易中順康三家亦有二三十萬之吸收、貿大鴻大中一吃進亦不少、尚有一般散戶買進亦絡繹小絕、但賣戶聯益大通聯和早晚不斷供給、餘如通記順泰三開萬春怡泰協興源等供出數量有過之無不及、故市價仍係由高而低、毫無振作、結果復父回小五分一角至二角半、成交總數、共計的一百五六十萬元茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新亞藥廠股二百股、價爲二十九元二角半、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市開盤仍靜、入後人心稍佳、但成交依然稀少，價格方面、無特殊變更足述、祇信和股一度曾漲至八元六角、同時毛絨股在六元八角牛、價亦能站穩、</p>
<p>倫敦十日（週二）電，今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、中國外債前檔市氣堅强、行情冉漲二鎊至五鎊不等、計克利斯浦升五鎊、價爲二十五鎊、英德續借款（英發）漲三鎊半、價爲四十二鎊、英法借款（英發）及善後借款（英發）各漲二鎊、英法爲四十五鎊、善後爲三十三鎊、後檔鐵路債券、祗廣九獨升一鎊、價爲十三鎊、其餘不動、股票銀行股續呈起色、滙豐銀行股冉升一鎊、英倫註冊股爲七十七鎊，香港註冊股爲八十鎊、有行無市、有利銀行升五先令、價爲十鎊十二先令六便士、餘無變化、</p>

<p>連　幾日之紗市、昨則稍形　挫、此因多頭獲利吐出、致檯面一鬆而下落、但實際交易尚稱不惡、三二支單紗售價依然上漲、三二支貓蝶售一千六百八十元至一千七白元、比上日在升四十元、所以有斯情形、同業傾向買方、而三二支港幫仍有需要、苦無現貨供給、就此而論、廠方當然改紡細紗、獲利較厚、二十支紗錠當然减少、出數則稀、因之近日拖進者頗不乏人也、不過目前銷路未見進展、惟目前雜牌紗價、未免太廉也、今日有棉紗六百二十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後人氣熱烈異常、首盤賡續前進、二十支雙馬價爲一千二百九十元、此時買聲振盪、少頃直升至一千二百九十七元、但上决十月二十二日高峯已到一千三百〇二元、有一部份投機者看其尚未穿出、不妨將多頭吐出、又復回下至一千二白化十元、然價格一疲、買風再起、又升至一千二百九十六元、但二次未能漲出關外、於是搶帽子之戶、紛粉賣出、市盤乃續趨下降至一千二百八十一元收盤、但大戶絕無放棄觀念、價格如低、恐有加碼之舉、查生日問成交統計四千七百叫十包、行情二十支雙馬與上日無甚軒輊、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉情况、依然堅挺、而廠方辦意漸勁所以市價不能看小、不過據棉商消息、有一部份洋行已向印度購訂矣、至於華棉來源、依舊不爽不快也、火機草包價爲二百零九元、彭家浦價爲二百五十九元、太倉價二百十四元、巴西棉價爲二百八十四五元、</p>

<p>廠布昨市趨勢續堅、本街客幫交易頻繁、售盤繼續上漲、白貨一部份粗細布斜紋漲每疋一角至二角半、漂染布中平、缺檔各牌漲每疋二角半之譜、申新廠開現打富貴細布價三十五元、富貴細斜價三十二元，計一百餘件、市上手貨提漲每疋二角半、春令貨各種坯布本街成交頗繁、綜計二萬餘疋、此外花布府綢色布漂布羽綢藍布等亦達三百餘件、粗細布斜紋二百餘件、浙閩幫辦漂染布一百數十件、事港幫辦　綢色布漂布等二百餘件、花布府綢等期貨三百餘件、今日有疋頭九百三十五件遝香港、</p>
<p>東布　因紗市回跌、龍頭細布亦挫落每疋六角，收盤三十六元三角半、嗶嘰一元一角零七釐半、而中檔細布則以實需仍旺、僅跌三四角、</p>

<p>昨糖市趨勢因粗砂存底微薄、人心亦佳、故市續升、公會劃盤、二四粗白現貨本棧七十四元、外棧七十三元六角至七角、後討七十四元、計升五角、太古車白仍立原盤、B嘜西棧七十三元五角、東棧七十三元、DY嘜西棧六十九元四角、HX嘜六十九元二角、HM嘜西棧六十五元八角、荷赤現貨五十六元四角至五十六元七角、十月二十日打單者五十六元九角、又昨日由嗬囒運來糖三千五百包、</p>

<h3 id="c73">法租界各捕房華捕　昨要求改善待遇　華捕約千餘人一度怠崗　經會談後旋卽照常服務　所提要求十七項法總監允圓滿答復 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>公共租界華捕要求改善待遇問題、獲圓滿解決後、法租界全體華捕、以收入微薄、難維生活、亦卽向法當局提出口頭要求、增加華捕薪給、盧家灣捕房一百五十人、並於昨日上午八時二十五分首先怠崗、其他如嵩山路、大自鳴鐘各捕房、及預備隊車務處等華捕聞訊、卽紛紛響應、華捕一千四百名、均停止工作、致法租界警務處總監法勃爾及副總監勃朗希、隨卽召盧家灣捕房華捕談話、華捕代表三人、卽呈遞要求條款、法勃爾表示願加研究、於三四日內、必予圓滿答覆、華捕認爲滿意、並以治安爲重、至上午十時、卽全體絡續復崗、交通秩序、亦告恢複、茲誌各情如次、</p>
<p>法捕出勤維持交通</p>
<p>當昨日上午八華捕怠崗後、法租界各馬路交通、因乏人指揮、致車輛行駛、一時頗現混亂狀態、昨晨九時、大批私人汽車經霞飛路自西向東行駛、赴外灘一帶公司商號辦公、此本爲素有現象、但因霞飛路上紅綠燈大部無人操縱之故、致連綿達數百輛之多、同時電車人力車亦連接而行、遲緩非常、嗓聲雜作、大有山陰道山之概、迨後電車公司職員及法國巡捕出動、在各交通口指揮、秩序始稍恢復、但因人手不多、頗現忙碌、霞飛路及福煦路一部份銀樓及大商店聞知華捕怠崗後、卽閉門停業、以防不測、其他各處商店、則未受影響、</p>
<p>法國防軍加入巡邏</p>
<p>華捕怠崗後、法租界當局恐治安發生問題、隨卽緊急命令全體法國防軍。法僑義勇隊。候補巡捕。等立卽動員、分派赴各重要地點駐防、並以五人編爲一組、在霞飛路福煦路等處巡邏、並搜查行人車輛、安南及白俄巡捕、則被派執行華捕所遺工作、法籍捕頭並乘機器脚踏車在各馬路兜馳、鐵甲車亦巡弋各處、殊爲忙碌、但以法越警員人數不多、力量仍極單薄、惟法租界居戶均特別謹慎、故並未聞有何意外事件發生、出動佈防之法越軍警、於復崗後仍在巡邏、至下午始告復員、</p>
<p>當局保證圓滿答復</p>
<p>怠崗事件發生後、法警務處總監法勃爾及副總監勃朗希、卽於八時三刻、召集盧家灣捕房華補談話、到華捕一百二十人、法勃爾宣稱、法租界當局對最近物價高漲後華捕之生活、甚爲留意、且已在考慮改善辦法、望華捕將要求提出、華捕代表一五八•一六四·五九八•三人、當卽將條款遞上、法勃爾稱此項條件、現本人願保證在三四日內、必予圓滿答復、望卽復崗、以保治安等語、華捕認爲滿意、隨卽恢復上崗、昨日淸晨、一華捕宣傳員在薛華立路馬斯南路宣傳怠崗時、爲白俄探員逮捕、但在復崗前、卽行釋放、</p>
<p>提出要求共十七項</p>
<p>全體華捕所提出之要求共十七項，爲（一）要求成立法租界華捕互助會、（二）要求設華捕總巡寫字間於中央捕房、（三）薪金最少六十元、米貼五斗、特別津貼三十元、房貼十八元、年底雙薪照正式工資發給、（四）儲蓄金照舊、每年加年份工資二元、（五）巡捕手槍被刦、其已革職者、不得賠償槍款、（六）預備班依照舊例預備二十四小時、（七）號衣改爲西式、冬夏一律用黑呢綁腿、（八）檢查號衣及操班、規定每年二次、（九）偵探處缺少人員、須由華捕考選、（十）每人發華捕證、遊戲塲電車公園一律免費、（十一）總房間除中國特別紀念日及法國國慶日、不得禁止出外、（十二）上差時間有日差應取消夜差、晚差雙崗、聯絡巡邏、（十三）華捕受重罰或革職、須由華捕總巡簽字、（十四）絨毯內衣蓆子、須由捕房發給、（十五）成立華捕子弟學校、（十六）每年給公事差一月、薪金照發、如巡捕受罰者、不得擅扣公事差假日、（十七）不得追究華捕按月繳納「公事」、</p>
<p>聲明絕無其他目的</p>
<p>據華捕方面表示、昨日發生怠崗、純因生活迫不得已之故、華捕薪金每月僅二十四元半、另有米貼五斗、津貼十七元一角五分、但總數亦祇七十四元、在此物價激漲之時、欲維持一家生活、顯屬不可能、苦哀當可得全體市民之諒解與同情、各華捕等每月須撬車輛照會十五張之命令、尤感苦痛、</p>

<p>據外人方面消息、工部局對於日憲兵毆打警務處華籍警官一案、昨日仍未向日當局提出抗議、據工部局發言人稱、此項抗議、大概將於今日上午由總董凱自威向日方提出、</p>
<p>工董會議決定交涉</p>
<p>關於日商公共汽車、在滬西界外區域、侵害工部局特許交通營業權利、已由該局總董凱自威前日向日本駐滬總領事掘內干城、提出交涉、已誌昨報、茲據大中社記者探悉、昨日下午、工部局董事會舉行例會時、對於此一事件、曾提出報告、據稱、經向日領署調查結果、日領表示、日商公共汽車之在滬西行駛、係私人方面之行動、日本官方、並不知悉、各董事討論結果、議決除由行政當局據理進行交涉外、並委托日董、進行調查此事之眞相、</p>
<p>不力車照尙待報吿</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、頃悉關於工部局警務處華籍警官一員、近遭日憲兵毆辱事、預料工部局總董凱目威、將於今日（十一日）向日領署當局正式提出新交涉、至於西區最近「通告」界外馬路上人力車將從星期一日起被迫捐領「市府」照會事、工部局今晨正候警務處提出正式報告、工部局某昌聲稱、關於後一問題非俟接獲警務處報告、不能發表言論</p>
<p>撤消封鎖並無徵象</p>
<p>滬西封鎖區情勢、今日仍稱平靜、官方昨曾（十日）表示、相信限制諒將於星期六日撤消、但今晨未在該區見限制將撤除之具體徵象、日商公共汽車繼續行駛愚園路上、日憲兵與傭警則仍在該區嚴施搜查、</p>
<p>報販被扣尙未釋放</p>
<p>外傳日方禁止報紙送交封鎖區內及開近居民之說、日官方人士今晨加以吾認、據稱、携包裹之華人固受搜查、報紙則准送入封鎖區云、惟據華方人士消息、報販數人、昨區送報入對鎖區、被拘入極司非而路日憲兵司令部、今日尚未釋出、同時工部局總董凱自威昨因日方公共汽車行駛西區事向駐滬日領署提出抗議、今日正候答覆中、</p>

<p>上海靑年會爲救濟受凍苦兒徵募冬衣、已誌本報、茲悉該會先後收到各界熱心善士所捐新舊衣服數白件、現款八千餘元、進行購置布料棉花、着手縫製、並探得繼續勸募及各項情形如後、</p>
<p>義務縫製</p>
<p>該會對於縫製冬衣、事先曾經嚴密考慮，定有詳細辦法、而當有敎育之意義、前日該會分請會友家屬到會、義務代縫、同時由中國內衣公司捐助電剪及栽衣技師二人、叉勝家公司捐借縫衣機器六架、當時着手用電剪剪裁、至爲迅速、衣料數百件、頃刻裁成、大小尺寸、整齊劃一、此外摺布·踏車·鋪花·行針·釘帶·印字、分工合作、參加士女、均極興奮、每件除面裹外、計裝棉花一市斤、工料成本、的合國幣三元五角、</p>
<p>繼續勸募</p>
<p>該會以目前所收衣服、連所製者、僅有二千餘件、上海苦兒。爲數甚多、瞬屆嚴寒、不敷分配、當由該會所組之冬衣委員會會議決定、繼續進行動募、其辦法係印製一種三元冬衣牧據、分發該會會友攤認、此後復由各委員分頭勸募、並爲鼓勵起見、凡募得成績最多之前五名、分別贈獎、以示推崇、又該會爲求普請捐助計、特製成苦兒捐款箱十餘只、擬在耶穌聖誕節前分別陳列各大商店及影戲院最易注目之所、請求捐助、上海好善樂施士女極多，想不難得有大宗捐款也、</p>
<p>施散辦法</p>
<p>該會委員、鑒於上海每年冬季各慈善團體施散冬衣、常爲受者所典押或分配不均、流弊百出、結果眞貧苦者不能受到實惠、反爲奸滑者一人朦領數件、展轉押賣、致使捐助者一片婆心、付之虛擲，甚可惜也、現該會擬用科學方法、先在貧民區域實地調查每一苦兒之家庭狀况、加以統計、擇赤貧而最苦者、施行散放、每一件冬衣裹子、特印有「冬衣禦寒、典當不收、」紅字、俾使款不虛靡、功歸實際也、</p>

<p>Mammy，don’tget　lost！”媽媽，不要軋散了！」一個外國女孩子的嬌脆呼聲，從黑壓壓地人叢中，衝破了細碎紛雜的笑語氛圍，纔把道一句話送進了她母親的耳朶裹。</p>
<p>大家軋得連氣都喘不過來，好容易伸長了手，拿出一元錢，買過入塲券，纔靠着紥遍了靑松翠柏的扶梯攔杆，自己也不必多所用力，後面自有人把你一步一擁的聳着上樓梯。俯視鬥口放着了幾盆三四尺來高的「象牙紅」，受了「人氣」的薰蒸，格外鮮艷欲滴。售券檯上堆滿了鈔票，越積越多……抬起頭來時，身子巳在跑馬總會二樓「綠窒」門口，裹面就是昨日本埠英僑婦女協會，爲籌款濟助祖國作戰而設的義賣塲。</p>
<p>英大使寇爾爵士夫人，致詞方畢，大家一片掌聲，表示熱烈的歡迎。她站在台上，面帶春風和煦似的笑容·玲瓏，身材，穿着深顏色的服裝，益顯得雍容華貴。頭上戴着翻邊時式帽子，把她豐而不肥，鵝蛋型的小圓臉，襯托得格外靈活動人·鎂光泡的强烈電光，從各方面集中於她，此歇彼繼，直到她下台始已。這時候正是三時有零，義賣就正式開幕了。</p>
<p>‘，Try　your　iuek”——「試試你的運氣」……“ny　thing　else”……「再要買些麼？」……“how　lovely　it　is”——。多麼動人呀！」耳朶裹儘是這種聲昔。要是繼續寫下去話，竟可編成一章英話會語了！滿屋子中，靜止着的是各種吃的，用的，裝飾的義賣……東西；前擁後擠的是許多外國女太太和小孩子。這一間位於跑馬廳大看台上的正廳，可說已擠得水洩不進·要費上九牛二虎之力，饞能身不自主，隨波逐流般的，在這「人潮」中滾過一個圈于</p>
<p>一進門，自左至右，靠壁角是出售糖菓的攤，再進爲「舊貨攤」，書攤，和出售零星聖誕禮物的櫃子。正對大門為「糠中摸彩」處，分男孩與女孩兩部。廳的正中植有大聖誕節樹一棵，上面流蘇瓔珞，采絲銀帶，裝飾得非常美麗，叫週還放了許多玩具。越過聖誕樹，爲出售貝充所製的小玩意所在，售價目二角至數允，相當便宜。靠出口處門的爲拍賣品陳列處，東西不少，都是滬上各商行所捐贈的。如謀得利的唱片，老介福的綢緞，以及私人所助的自來水筆，茶具，中國畫，雪茄，威士忌酒等，花色十分繁多。</p>
<p>靠東沿看台窗子的一排攤基，爲園藝品，女用化裝品，Tombola—一種抽簽對號購物，猜數競賽，及玩具櫃。出售園藝及家製品的一角，用佈景搭成房屋的，一個剖面，頗見匠心。行開幕禮時，寇爾大使夫人就是站在這屋子佈景前致詞的。抽　對號購　係用彩紙捲成細條，出　一　購買一條，拆開來如有號數，　對號領物。女太太們購買的十分踴躍。猜數競賽分五角，一元不等。把一籃硬殼菓，或一只燻火腿，猜它的數目和重量。有一位戴眼鏡，很精明似的老太太，跑過來雙手把那只火腿舉起米，嘴裏說道：「十二磅」，於是女顧員把她的姓名住址記下來，以待　曉時汕知她，如果那只火腿眞是十二磅重的話。貴重東西的猜測比賽，券價有高至五元的。</p>
<p>因爲尾內人數過多，不要說買東西不方便，連看看也都很困難。一位携着女孩子的太太，和她的同伴道：「我帶了一百元的支票來，很想多購些東西，可是擁擠得無法下手呢。」言下有不勝惋惜之意。她的同伴對於會塲的管理沒有秩序，也發揮了幾句。克佐士會計師在二樓設有臨時銀行，凡是携有票據，或須兌換的，儘可向這銀行去辦理。</p>
<p>好容易擠出了朝北的門，走過冰琪淋攤，折入遊戲室·裹面有釣魚，小高爾夫球，用筷子挾玻璃彈，旅行比賽，地圖插旗，擲沙包等玩意兒。</p>

<p>— 木禾</p>
<p>『一夜間我就變了寡婦，這眞是想不到的事……』她說時似乎很茫然。</p>
<p>我看着她那茫然的臉和抱在手裹，戴着一頂級着白球的白布帽子的孩子，也覺得有些茫然。我說不出一句安慰的話，似乎也不想說一句話。是的，對於寡婦和孤兒，除了實際的幫助以外，單是同情有甚麼用呢？</p>
<p>『我眞不知要怎樣來謝你，道是眞的。……你不曉得我多難過，他死了以後，除了你來看我以外，只有一個陌生的老婆子看見我和孩子穿着考服，說了一句同情的話：「年紀這樣靑，孩子這樣小就沒了男人，守了寡眞可憐。」……』她說，眼向我投射着感激的光。</p>
<p>我驚訝，我奇怪：這樣小的同情會引起她的眞誠的激動？</p>
<p>『你奇怪不是？』她似乎懂得我的意思，『這够簡單，有什麼可怪的呢？我成了寡婦，別人都看不起我，甚至有些討厭我；並且連孩子也不能例外。那天我親自聽見房東女人對別人說：「是這孩子命壞，八字凶，你看自從那孩子生了以後，他們夫妻兩個不是他害病就是她睡倒的，藥罐從沒離過門」』。她望了望安靜地陲在她懷裹的孩子。</p>
<p>孩子是無辜的，我想。</p>
<p>『裝棺材那天，我眞難過，但哭不出來，她們可硬要我哭；孩子嗎？她們說這是和他爸爸見最後的一面，要他哭一决，於是她們打孩子，打他的臉，擰他的膀子，孩子大聲的哭了出來。當時我看見眞難過，現在我懊悔爲甚麼當時不阻止她們……』。她又看看孩子，緊緊地抱着他。</p>
<p>孩子是無辜的，我想。</p>
<p>『她們因爲我沒有哭得像「樣」，哭聲旣不大，又不會一邊哭一邊訴說，都說我太沒有個禮數，怨我，恨我，看小起我。』她繼續說，『我抱着孩子回去的時候，房東女人老遠就拿着一條燒着的草條迎着我，叫我抱着孩子在火上跨過，　說是爲了要「燒」去「晦氣」，呵，我眞受不住，呵……』她哭了。</p>
<p>孩子是無辜的，她也是無辜的，我又想。</p>
<p>『我不能想以後怎樣過活的事——我不敢想，眼前別人的仇視已經够把我嚇死了。……』她抽泣着。</p>
<p>回去的時候，我彷彿看見許多含着敵意的臉，在我眼前晃動着，我明白了，人類就是速不値價的同情也不肯輕易給人，要看準了對象才「施與」的。我憤怒地握着拳，讓冷風吹在我的臉上，我凝視着這無情的社會。</p>

<h3 id="c94">妻子的呼籲 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>這是一個可憐的妻子的呼籲，請您指示我一條路途罷！</p>
<p>我們是由愛情而結合的伴侶，三年的小家庭生活，過得相當美滿。我們各有着安定的職業，一筆不小的收入，足够支持一個中等以上的家庭生活；我們沒有嗜好，沒有煩惱，父母俱存，兄弟無故。除了缺少一個孩子之外，我再想不出我們還需要什麼了。</p>
<p>不知怎的一來，厄運會突地臨到了我們的頭上：今年春天，股票價格飛漲，我的丈夫行中幾個熱中利祿的同事，每天瘋在似的向外面打電話，他耳中聽見的，不是老王的會得豐賺進一千，便是阿張的揚子賺進八百。久而久之，他也手慶起來，東拚西湊了一些本錢，加入投機事業。起先倒也很順利，盈餘了一二千元，因而他便不捨得歇手，終於有一天，股票跌價了，像山洪暴發似的一瀉千里！他的本錢和餘利通通塡進了這可怕的窟窿！</p>
<p>在這山窮水盡之時，他仍是不能甘心，每日痴想着翻本，甚至於在辦公處告了假跑到甚麼銀號中去看行市。可是，有甚麼用呢？正像某國軍人的泥足一樣，越陷越深罷了。</p>
<p>請看：我們現在的生活罷！房子頂了，傢具賣了，存款押了，我的一點珍飾，私蓄，也已羅掘一空，外面還欠着上萬的債！</p>
<p>我已曾幾决勸他洗手不幹，拚着幾年吃苦，也可以還債了；無奈他在一羣損友的包圍和誘惑之中，人已是昏迷了，我的話那裹能够生效！前幾日我見他又是書空咄咄，茶飯無心，才發現他暗地又送掉了幾百元！</p>
<p>先生：他是失足了，我將怎麼辦呢？長此以往，我們的前途將要不堪設想！空口白話已不能堅定他的意志，吵鬧呢，也徒然增加氣憫。請您給我個更有效的法子罷！一個人的墮落並不單單影響他家庭的幸福，對於國家社會，也是一樓大損失呢！</p>
<p>一個憂心如焚的女子謹上年靑而賢明的太太：</p>
<p>為了丈夫失足在投機事業之中，而把一個家庭弄得這樣的不安，眞是一件値得惋惜的事。在這種不幸的情形之下，正是一個賢慧的妻子大展身手的好機會。你說得很對，吵鬧是有害無益的，態度溫和的勸告是不妨找些好機會繼續下去的，除了道兩點之外，你對於丈夫的不幸，應該表示同情，可是對於丈夫的行動，仍應堅持反對。目下家庭的環境，雖然不比從前了，可是你更應該抱着樂觀而鎮靜的態度，把家務理得井井有條，使丈夫對家庭不生厭惡之心。</p>
<p>你的丈夫目下是受了他的幾位同事的包團了，因此把你的話，看成耳邊風。可是你千萬不要因此而灰心，他那昏迷的腦經，總有一天會淸醒過來的。我們覺得在這一方面，你有一點是可以試試看，你除了隨時勸告丈夫以外，還可以設法和他的同事們接近，隨時勸勸他們跳出投機的深坑。如果可能的話，最好聯合這些同事的夫人們，一致行動，使他們能够早日覺悟。</p>
<p>你對於投機事業的觀點是正確的，我們覺得你是一位不可多得的有志氣而賢慧的妻子，我們相信在你的堅苦奮鬬之下，你的家庭是可以重新走上康莊大道的。我們在這裹預祝你早日成功。編者</p>

<p>— 顾明道</p>
<p>石達把手向窗外十指道：「靜園已在前面，旣是你們要去遊園，不妨請便。俺蒙你們賜給美酒佳殺，感謝不勝，且容俺任。多喝幾杯。你們若要陪一個乞丐飲酒，俺是媿不敢當，而又萬分不安了。」張天如聽石達說得爽快，遂道：「很好。我們船上少說些也有十數斤酒帶着，我們都是量淺的，請石壯士儘喝便了。」石達道：「多謝盛情，你們要遊靜園的，請便吧。」絳子起初瞧着大漢害怕，此時反驚喜他爽直之中遇有嫵媚，祗是對着他憨笑，於是張天如留大漢石達在艙中飲酒，他自己携帶柳氏姊妹舍舟登陸，到靜園去了。靜園是垂虹亭畔的名園，地方雖小，而緒構非常曲折瑰麗，是詩人倪南雲隱居之地。張天如和倪南雲也是文字之交，時常詩酒唱酬，所以此次他帶着柳氏姊妹去拜訪他，兼遊靜園。柳氏姊妹本爲松陵產，自幼孤苦伶仃，身世可憐，做了徐大娘的養女。徐大娘年輕時候也是盛澤鎮上名校書，後來年華漸老，身軀日胖，自己不能再應接客人了，便領了柳氏姊妹爲養女，撫爲己有。長名楊愛，字影嶙，决名絳子。至於如是兩字的芳名是張天如代伊起的。如是絳子一雙姊妹花，雖然紅顏命薄，幼弱無依，可是一般都生得天仙一般的美貌，才子一般的獲心。徐大娘請了名師敎他們讀書寫字，而柳如是的大小楷允其寫得工正而娟秀，更兼歌喉淸脆，如好鳥枝頭，所以名噪江南。所居歸家院，車水馬龍，門庭若市。徐大娘有了這一對搖錢樹，怎不喜歡。但是如是的性情孤芳自負，十分高傲，每自矜持，少所許可。來遊的都是風雅之輩，大家都知道伊的脾氣，對伊不敢狎視，這也因爲如是內才學和容貌足以壓到羣芳，人家自然情情愿愿讓伊三分。而伊的妹妹絳子也和伊姊姊一樣的聰慧絕人，所以看見他們的人無不稱讚。復社名士張天如退隱家園，一見如是，許爲天人之資，天天到伊妝閣裹來敎他們讀詩詞歌賦。且喜二人舉一反三，聞一知二，非常穎悟，進步甚快。一二年來，如是的詩學大進，而目伊的記憶力尤强，過目不忘，因此經史也很博此。又能深明大義，讀書得間。張天如晚年得此一雙女弟子，寄托有人，胸懷怡然，目覩着如是這般傾團佳人，心非木石，安能無動，所謂情之所鍾，正如我輩，他心裹很想把柳如是納爲小星，無奈自己不是食祿萬鍾之輩，拿不出十斛明珠以聘，且營金屋以藏阿嬌，祗得日造妝閣授書，對此絕頂聰明的女弟子，秀色可以療飢，這也是張天如的一種痴想。其實柳如是旣然自負才貌雙全，一且擇人而事，也決不肯下家一固荒江窮巷的老名士，心目中自然另有其人呢？（七）</p>

<p>— 星谷</p>
<p>湯傑，這一個銀幕上逗人發笑的王先生，在電影圈裹服務的歷史，着實不能算短暫了。起初，他是明星公司裹的一個演員，後來，葉淺予畫的王先生連環圖畫，大受人們歡迎，靈機一動，於是湯傑就以模仿王先生的姿態，在銀慕出現了，那時他在天一公司，出於意料之外，「王先生」影片大受觀衆歡迎，這樣，湯傑就長期以「王先生」自居了。</p>
<p>當戰事發生後，湯傑一度組織了一個「王家班」，在內地各帶演出，很受各方擁護，後來，會合「影人劇團」打成一起，去年，「影人劇團」解散，湯傑乃重回上海，加入新華，仍繼續攝製王先生影片；現在，於「王先生夜探殯儀館」一片完竣後，湯傑已向國聯當局告假若干時日，蓋爲復活其「王家班」另謀發展。</p>
<p>昨日，記者會見湯傑，談話之下，得悉具「王家班」演出事，進行已很有頭緒，因內地目前不能前去，故決定先在上海演出，日期自本月十八日起至二十四日爲止，計演一星期，地點已假定璇宮劇院。</p>
<p>其演出名義，因某種關係，不用「王家班」而改爲「未明劇團」。團員全屬「王家班」原班人馬，演出戲名，爲「王先生拆穿西洋鏡」顧名思義，又楚一部滑稽劇了。</p>
<h3 id="c99">「女兒國」 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>

<p>「女兒國」中的演員，幾乎動員了藝華（的全體新舊演員，允其是新人，都參加了「女兒國」的工作，其中女國王一角，已由新人狄萍小姐担任。狄萍小姐來自新加坡，但是國語却流俐無比，藝華對她抱着很大的希望、以前一度　將她任爲新片「千里送京娘」的主角，後來因爲「女兒國」的需要，才改爲主演女兒國了。</p>

<p>— 唐</p>
<p>（十一）徐雪樓</p>
<p>在書壇上，大家都知道有個盛名藉藉的徐三檔，初期的徐三檔以徐雪行爲領導者，雪行的妹妹雪人，女弟子雪月爲輔，以彈唱「三笑」「描金鳳」著譽於時。去年此時，雪人在蘇州嫁了人，雪月亦因滿師而脫離了徐雪行，目放單檔，（最近雪月在武進奏藝，不日將赴吳江。）於是由徐雪樓徐雪化遞補，抵了雪月雪人的遺缺；雪行彈弦千，雪樓彈月琴，雪花彈琵琶，這就成了現在的徐三檔；每天晚上，他們在南京書塲彈唱着，接受着書迷們的歡迎。</p>
<p>這裹所要介紹的，就是徐三檔中的後起之秀——徐雪樓小姐。</p>
<p>雪樓的原姓是唐，擁有鴛鴦湖烟雨樓等勝蹟的嘉興是她的故鄉，不幸的是她自幼就父母雙亡了，因朴螟蛉於黎里吳姓家，於是她也就姓了吳，名月仙，當擅說「雙珠鳳」的吳韻泉在黎里奏藝的時候，她因性之所好，在簡單的典禮之下拜了吳韻泉爲師，學習彈唱「雙珠鳳」。她禀性旣聰明，平日又揣摹有素，因此進步得很快，在十五歲的時候就「出道」放單檔。戰前，她在蘇州彈唱，這小妮子雖然「出道」未久，可是她生就了一個宜嗔宜喜的臉蛋兒，一笑就是兩個酒渦，又兼口曲十分淸晰，因此頗有一點號召的魔力。其間，她曾一度與徐雪行的帥兄華鈺笙拚雙檔。後來她的與徐雪行合作，就是華鈺笙所介紹。在名義上，她是徐雪行的義女兼女弟子，她的改名徐雪樓也是由此而始。</p>
<p>雪樓目「出道」釗現在，已歷三年；這就是說：她今年已是十八歲的人了！她也很懂得一點文墨，報章雜誌是她的業餘消遣物，她所擅長的是充當「上手」，說，噱，彈，唱，完全仿的是徐雪月。，因此很有些過去崇拜着徐雪月的人，現在是在迷惑着這一位徐雪月的承繼者——徐雪樓。</p>
<p>徐三檔從前所彈唱的僅有「三笑」與「描金鳳」兩部書，自雪樓加入了徐三檔，於是雪行叉從雪樓手裏　得了一個「雙珠鳳」的本子，所以一般徐三檔的老聽客都說：「雪樓是徐雪行的女弟子，同時也可以說是雪行的老師呢！」</p>

<h3 id="e1">Song Ziwen to Swiftly Depart for London to Handle Sino-British Loan Procedures; £5 Million to Purchase Steel and Nickel from British Territories; Dutch East Indies Willing to Supply China with Oil and Rubber <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>London: According to reliable sources, Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, may swiftly depart for London within days to handle the procedures for a Sino-British loan. This action follows Butler's announcement in the House of Commons yesterday that a loan of £10 million would be granted to China. Song's departure comes after negotiations in the United States have reached a significant stage. It is now known that the Chinese government intends to use part of the British loan to purchase pig iron and steel from India, both of which are essential war materials. Furthermore, it plans to purchase nickel from Canada and copper from Rhodesia. In addition, the Dutch side has suggested that the Dutch East Indies can supply China with oil and rubber. The amount of this British loan is roughly equivalent to the recent US loan of US$50 million. When Butler made the announcement in the House of Commons, he specified that Britain intends to use £5 million to stabilize Chinese finances and £5 million to allow China to purchase materials in various countries within the sterling area. Butler stated that, of course, the British government urgently needs to maintain the cash and US dollar assets possessed by countries within the sterling area to meet major wartime needs. Therefore, Britain cannot lend US dollars or British pounds convertible to US dollars to China. It can only adopt appropriate measures to limit the use of all British pounds owned by China to within the sterling area. According to this principle, the British government is willing to contribute £5 million to a fund to stabilize Chinese finances and cooperate with British territories to provide another £5 million in credit for purchasing goods from any part of the sterling area. This decision has been communicated to the Chinese government, and they have been requested to begin discussing the procedures as soon as possible and to first establish a technical plan. It is now understood that Song's trip to London is precisely for the purpose of discussing this technical plan. (Eleventh United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: British Foreign Secretary Butler announced in the House of Commons last night that the British government has decided to lend £10 million in British currency to the Chinese government, half for export credit and half for a stabilization fund. The entire chamber cheered in unison. First, a member of the opposition Liberal Party, Mandel, spoke, asking the government to pay attention to the US loan matter and asking whether Britain would provide the same assistance to China. Butler then informed him that the government, in view of the importance of its financial and economic relations with China, has decided to continue providing financial assistance to China. He also stated that Britain naturally needs to maintain its US dollar assets to provide currency for wartime use within the sterling area and cannot supply China with US dollars or British pounds convertible to US dollars. If appropriate measures can be taken to ensure that the British pounds held by China are used only within the sterling area, the British government is prepared, in principle, to lend £5 million for a Chinese stabilization fund and, with the consent of the British Commonwealth, to provide credit to facilitate the procurement of goods within the sterling area, limited to £5 million. The British government has notified the Chinese government of this intention, saying that efforts should be made to negotiate this new loan as soon as possible to establish a preliminary agreement. (Eleventh Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: After Britain decided to lend £10 million to China, Chinese authorities in London warmly welcomed the move, considering the British loan as a demonstration of British and American cooperation on China and Pacific policy. The shared interests between English-speaking democracies and China, as well as the importance of China's long-term war effort, were emphasized. Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi held preliminary discussions with Keynes, financial advisor to the British Treasury, today on technical agreements. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: After Britain lent £10 million to China, officials here unanimously praised the move, saying that the United States recently lent US$50 million to China, and Britain is now following suit. The joint assistance of Britain and the United States to China has been concretely demonstrated, and its political significance is substantial. (Tenth Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Chinese Government's Position Strengthened; Britain Decides to No Longer Please Japan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>London: The Times stated in an editorial today that the British government's announcement of financial assistance to the Chinese government in principle will be unanimously praised domestically, in the Commonwealth, and in the United States. For obvious reasons, the scope of British assistance to China cannot be as generous as the US loan last week, but this £10 million loan will have great value for the Chongqing government in terms of the goods it can purchase and as a symbol of British goodwill. The position of the government led by General Chiang Kai-shek has been strengthened by the reopening of the Burma Road and further enhanced by the withdrawal of Japanese troops from large areas of southern China. Financial assistance from Britain and the United States will further advance its progress. The Nanjing regime cannot and will never be an enemy of the Chongqing government in terms of loyalty to the great mass of Chinese people, because they all know that if the Japanese want to reduce their losses and withdraw from the Yangtze River basin, the Nanjing regime will not last long after the Japanese withdrawal. This loan to China will undoubtedly arouse the anger of the Japanese, which we may regret, but the responsibility lies with the Japanese government. They should remember that the British government once concluded a highly unpopular agreement with them to close the Burma Road, hoping that China and Japan could reach an understanding within the stipulated three-month period. The Japanese government's contribution to this agreement was limited to concluding a deal with the Nanjing regime, which only angered the Chinese government and failed to impress others. Apart from the above-mentioned events, the response to British goodwill has only been the persecution of British nationals in Japan, a campaign of insults and slanders in Japanese newspapers, and, finally, Japan's accession to the German-Italian axis. Now that Japan, as its Foreign Minister Matsuoka has admitted, has made the Three-Power Pact the guiding principle of its foreign policy, it is difficult to expect the British government to cater to its wishes and try to please it.

<p>US Bans Steel Exports; Japan Severely Affected</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt yesterday placed pig iron, ore sand, sheet iron, iron-steel mixtures, and certain iron and steel manufactures and semi-finished products under export license regulations. President Roosevelt telegraphed this decision to Washington from the cruiser "Tuscaloosa," as the President is currently touring US defenses in the Caribbean Sea. These restrictions on steel exports will take effect on December 30. It is believed here that Japan may be affected by this new control. Officials say that there are currently no plans for a total embargo. They say that these restrictions may be tightened in the future. Official figures on the export of these materials to Japan are currently unavailable, but according to a recent survey by a non-official organization, the "China Economic Research Committee," the United States supplies 32.5% of Japan's total iron and steel and semi-finished product imports, 98% of iron-steel mixture imports, and 91% of scrap iron and steel imports. (Eleventh United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to the "Hochi Shimbun," the Japanese government has been controlling four types of iron products—nails, iron wire, tinplate, and iron cables—since last year. Due to the increasingly severe international situation and the lack of pig iron materials, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry recently extended the control measures for iron products to eight types, including pure steel pipes, iron cans, bottle caps, ship chains, hoes, iron hammers, and window frames, bringing the total to twelve types. The ministry hopes that after the new measures are implemented, these items can be distributed evenly and sold according to officially set prices. (Eleventh Havas Dispatch)</p>

The club includes all Diet members and former members. The club will manage all meeting affairs. According to Japanese political circles, this organization is not a political party.

<p>Chongqing: The Chinese Institute of Engineers is holding its annual meeting in Chengdu. Chairman Chiang sent a telegram of encouragement. The original text is as follows: To President Chen and Members of the Chinese Institute of Engineers in Chengdu, I acknowledge you all. Your association convened in Dian last year, and Zhongzheng offered several words of encouragement. It is with great pleasure that I hear this year's annual meeting is being held in Chengdu, gathering scholars from across the country who specialize in engineering to engage in research on engineering academics and careers, to assist the military and support construction. Our sacred war has reached three years, and the sacrifices and struggles of the military and civilians across the country are aimed at seeking national independence and completing the grand plan of national construction. The primary task must be to first seek the independence and progress of our country's academics and skills in order to join the ranks of modern nations. Looking back over the past year, due to the increasing difficulty of the war and the new needs that have arisen in national economy and people's livelihood, as well as the new problems and new data that have arisen in the military and economy of various countries during the European war, they must have attracted your attention and contributed to practical research. I firmly believe that in this year, our engineering science has indeed made considerable progress. In order to implement the purpose of the war, the government has instructed the responsible authorities to pay special attention to the encouragement of invention and creation. The concrete realization of this will depend more on the mutual refinement and mutual promotion of our engineering scholars themselves, in order to create a new atmosphere of catching up and not falling behind. Then our national science will be able to develop and construction will be able to progress, and the great cause of rejuvenation will be able to be completed. Accelerate the training of technical talents, actively improve business efficiency, and connect economic construction undertakings with administrative agencies, and create the progress of our country's industry by leaps and bounds. I hope you will continue to work hard to achieve all that I have mentioned to expect from your association last year. As I send this telegram, my thoughts cannot help but fly there. I sincerely wish your meeting success. Zhongzheng, True Secret. (Eleventh Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Another Diplomatic Offensive <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>After the signing of the Abe document on November 30, world opinion pointed out that this move had no new significance. However, outwardly, it was a gesture by Japan to "end the China Incident." Logically, the next step should be the launch of a southward advance and even conflict with democratic countries. However, unexpectedly, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka released his first speech since taking office on the 9th of this month. Although he did not fundamentally deny the intention of southward advance and the delicate situation between the United States and Japan, his attitude was implicit and his tone was euphemistic, which is rare in recent Japanese diplomatic rhetoric. His reaffirmation of Japan's lack of territorial ambitions in East Asia and his new interpretation of the obligations Japan bears to the Three-Power Pact were sufficient to stimulate public opinion. It seemed that the attitude of the Japanese government, as expressed by Matsuoka, was not as worrying as the world had feared. According to news from Washington on the 10th, there were different reactions on their side. It is said that Matsuoka's speech failed to ease the firm attitude adopted by the United States toward the Pacific problems caused by Japan. Another report said that Matsuoka's expression of the flexibility of Japan's obligations to the alliance and the "peaceful nature" of its demands on the Dutch East Indies has triggered some optimism. Overall, the attitude of the US authorities has not been shaken as a result, but general sentiment has reduced some fears. Of course, this atmosphere will not have a decisive impact on the Far Eastern situation, but at least it is a new wave.</p>
<p>To understand Japan's political trends, it is necessary to pay attention to its entire context and historical development and never make judgments based on isolated expressions. Therefore, the first thing that needs to be clarified at present is whether Matsuoka's speech represents Japan's entire policy or only the views of himself and some government authorities. A year ago, Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura notified the United States of his intention to prepare to open the Yangtze River, which also won the favor of some Americans, but he was severely criticized in Japan, even forming one of the reasons for the collapse of the Abe cabinet. That experience should not be easily forgotten. Although Matsuoka is known as a pro-military figure, after he took office as foreign minister, especially after the Three-Power Pact aroused American criticism, his diplomatic path was not only incompatible with the so-called reformists, but was precisely following the path of Japan's old diplomatic traditions. Comparing Matsuoka's attitude in the past two months with the rhetoric of the Japanese right-wing press, it is not difficult to find the significant differences between them. Even after Matsuoka made this speech, the National News's attacks on the United States have only increased, and this fact cannot be ignored. When Konoe re-entered the stage, he did have considerable support from all parties in the military and government, but as the objective situation developed, his momentum has weakened day by day. Even the position of the cabinet itself is quite shaken, which is evident from its repeated replenishments of cabinet members and the reference of Hiranuma to join the cabinet. The fact that Konoe and Matsuoka have formed ties with the extremists and their conservative colors have become increasingly heavy is obviously not welcomed by the military right wing and the so-called reformist politicians. Therefore, it can also be seen that Matsuoka's attempt to seek US-Japan understanding is at most a kind of expectation from the conservative camp, and at the same time is what Konoe cabinet's future rests on. On the other hand, there is a significant force that contradicts this. Matsuoka's accusation that a US-Japan war is foolish is quite eloquent, but that foolish argument is currently being sung loudly in Japan. This phenomenon is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Secondly, if we look at the evolution of Japanese politics over the past decade, whether the ruling party is composed of politicians or military men, and whether their demeanor is moderate or radical, they all have a consistent position that never changes, which is their traditional colonial policy, including the northward continental policy and the southward marine policy. Regarding the implementation of these policies, they have repeatedly declared that they have no territorial ambitions, but the actual situation is well known to the world, and there is no need to repeat it. In terms of US-Japan relations, since the unfortunate incident of the Panay, the Japanese side has been working almost all the time to ease US-Japan relations. However, what has been realized in parallel is the continuous damage to American Far Eastern interests and the gradual expansion of Japanese power into the South Pacific. In Matsuoka's speech, the explanation of the southward advance policy listed place names such as Thailand, Malaya, and Burma, expressing willingness to reach an understanding, but did not mention the Philippines and Vietnam separately, probably because the former is too stimulating to the American public, and the latter has become a fact, and there is no way to hide it any further, but these two regions have already been placed by Japan into the "Co-Prosperity Sphere" long ago. On October 4 and 5, both Konoe and Matsuoka gave speeches that were not averse to war with the United States. If it were not for the United States tightening its embargo and aid to China, and the situation in the Mediterranean war developing in a direction unfavorable to the Axis powers, I am afraid that the attitude of the Japanese authorities would still be the same as it was two months ago, and they would definitely not even want to evade the obligations of the alliance. Moreover, with regard to the Far East issue, Britain has clearly taken the same stand and consistent attitude as the United States recently, while Japan is solely concerned with easing relations with the United States and hardly pays any attention to Britain. This point is also worth pondering.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese authorities have now clearly stated that they are unwilling to share the fate of the Axis powers, this is actually just a kind of temptation and even a disguised threat, and it is by no means enough to represent everything on the Japanese side today. The development of the Far Eastern situation is by no means merely tied to the momentary diplomatic posture of the Japanese government. Only the attitudes of the various powers involved and the evolution of the European war are the important factors that determine this issue. In reviewing the high-sounding diplomatic rhetoric that Japan has made throughout its history, Matsuoka's talk yesterday, apart from his subjective hope that it would have a kind of anesthetic effect and become a new kind of diplomatic offensive, actually has no new significance at all.</p>

<p>Savanakhet - Various developments here today indicate that Thailand will soon launch a major offensive against Vietnam. It is widely believed that the date of the offensive may be on the next full moon, as this is considered a very important date by Thai Buddhists. Thailand's recent large-scale troop concentration also indicates that Thailand will soon attack Vietnam. At the same time, Thai artillery across the Mekong River suddenly opened fire on this area for thirty minutes. In addition, several aircraft were dispatched to fly here and drop six bombs. Thai aircraft continued to fly to Ta Khek, hitting one bomb, which disrupted the telegraph lines between that place and Vientiane. (11th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi - Thai land and air forces have again taken aggressive actions against Vietnamese territory in the past two days. The details have been announced in an official communiqué, which states: "(1) On the morning of the 9th of this month, Thai aircraft groups flew to Savannakhet, Laos, and dropped six bombs, only damaging two houses. In the afternoon, six Thai aircraft again dropped seven bombs on the city, one of which landed in the courtyard of a hospital, causing no casualties or injuries and very little material damage. (2) After Thai aircraft bombed Thakhek, Laos, on the 8th of this month, Vietnamese aircraft bombed Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, yesterday in retaliation. Afterwards, Thai aircraft chased the Vietnamese aircraft group directly into Laotian territory, and an air battle ensued. As a result, one Thai aircraft was shot down by our side, and another may have suffered the same fate. Our aircraft all returned safely to their base. (3) On the night of the 9th of this month, the Vietnamese Air Force, in retaliation for Thai aircraft bombing Savannakhet twice, flew to Udon Thani, Thailand, regardless of the adverse weather. After identifying the airfield, they dropped multiple bombs, totaling 3,500 pounds, and distributed a large number of leaflets. At that time, several fires were observed in the field. (4) At 5:00 AM today, Thai artillery again fired thirty shells at Savannakhet, causing no damage. At 7:30 AM, three Thai aircraft again dropped four bombs on Thakhek and strafed the ground with machine guns, killing one sentry and damaging several houses. The local anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire, and one Thai aircraft was seen being hit, burning, and falling into the right bank of the Mekong River (inside Thailand)." Also, well-informed sources here stated that the Vietnamese authorities have not changed their attitude towards Thailand and are still willing to continue negotiations according to past policies, but any hostile actions will be met with the same retaliatory measures. At present, communication between the French Embassy in Thailand and Vietnam is cut off, all due to the Thai authorities' deliberate severance of all communication between Thailand and Vietnam in recent days.

<p>Athens - The Greek government issued an official announcement stating that the Greek army began the second phase of operations against Italy yesterday. Soldiers on the front lines are pursuing Italian troops across the entire 150-mile front without rest. Italian troops are retreating north from the Argyrokastron area and from the coast towards the Himalayan Mountains. Italian rear guard units are resisting Greek troops with fierce fighting to prevent the Greek army from pursuing them, suffering heavy losses. It is believed that the first phase of the war has achieved initial success in a very short period of time. Now, a second phase of the offensive must be launched immediately, without waiting for the 80,000 reinforcements sent by Italian Commander Soddu to join the front lines. It is claimed that the Greek army is currently examining the large amount of equipment abandoned by Italian troops in Delvino. The war zone has a treacherous climate, with heavy snow and hail, but this is not enough to deter the bravery and determination of the Greek army. It is now planned to press forward in one go, without giving the Italian army a chance to reorganize. Foreign reporters also reported that Italian troops attempted to hold their positions north of Delvino, but eventually collapsed. Recent reports indicate that the entire right wing of the Italian army retreated in disarray after losing Argyrokastron. There was fierce fighting north of Pogradec yesterday, and Italian troops along the coast also retreated to the port of Durazzo. (11th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Athens - War reports said that due to the continuous progress of the Greek army, the morale of the Italian army was low. They were building defensive fortifications around Durazzo overnight.

It is also claimed that Greek troops on the northern and southern lines are still advancing through rain and snow. (10th International News Service dispatch)</p>
<p>London - According to a Reuters correspondent on the Yugoslavian-Albanian border, Greek troops north of Argyrokastron have advanced to the village of Kodri in the Tepelene region.

Currently, the advance has had to be slowed down slightly due to the increasingly long transportation lines and extremely adverse weather. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London - A Reuters special correspondent on the Yugoslavian-Albanian border reported that the Greek army continued to fiercely attack the left flank of the Italian army yesterday on the northern part of the 80-mile Albanian front. The Greek army first bombarded with heavy artillery, then advanced north of Mount Mokra under the cover of machine guns and mortars, with the aim of forcing the Italian army to retreat to Librazhd. The Italian army launched several counterattacks, but the Greek army has now assembled strong reinforcements, apparently wanting to force the Italian army to abandon the positions they hold in the Pogradec area. It is reported that the Italian army resisted fiercely, but the outcome of the battle is still unclear. Further south, the Greek army continued to advance slowly, step by step, regardless of the mortar fire of the Italian army, the difficult mountainous terrain, and the adverse weather. The Greek advance in the north is aimed at the Shkumbin River valley and will soon face the extremely strong Italian positions in Librazhd. Fierce fighting is also taking place in the Moscopole area. The Italian army has launched many ineffective counterattacks. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e34">British Launch Offensive on Western Egyptian Frontier; British Forces Advance 75 Miles; Armored Units Assisted by Air Force; Break Through Strong Italian Coastal Positions; Fighting Ongoing Southeast of Barrani <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>London - After British armored units broke through the Italian lines in the western Egyptian desert, it is rumored that they have now cut off the communications of part of two Italian divisions at Sidi Barrani. The attacking British forces are composed of British, Dominion, and Free French troops. At dawn on Sunday, a surprise attack was launched on the Italian army along a 30-mile front. In less than 36 hours, they reached the coast between Sidi Barrani and Buq Buq. During the British advance, British aircraft constantly bombed Italian communication lines to hinder their reinforcement operations. British aircraft tactics varied, either flying low and dropping tons of bombs or using machine guns to strafe the enemy. The clear moonlight lately is what stopped Alexandria from being attacked by Italian aircraft. This must be because the Royal Air Force is assisting the ground forces in their advance. The Italian forces under General Graziani's command in North Africa seem to be stationed in the Solum area bordering Egypt and Libya. This British offensive was carefully prepared behind the lines for several months. Therefore, from the British headquarters in Cairo to the various British forces in the Middle East along a 400-mile front in the desert, adjustments have been made and perfect actions are being taken to quickly advance to the coast, cutting off the communication between the Libyan Italian forces holding Sidi Barrani and the several Italian divisions supporting them from the west. The area occupied by the Italian army is roughly an equilateral triangle, with its three points being Sidi Barrani, Mersa Matruh (15 miles east along the coast), and Nibeiwa (15 miles south of Sidi Barrani). On Monday morning, the British army occupied the barracks at Nibeiwa, capturing 500 people. While the Navy bombarded one side of this triangular area, the British armored vehicles, assisted by infantry, attacked the other two sides. The Royal Air Force also cooperated closely, constantly soaring over the entire area, bombing Italian positions, destroying motorized transport teams, and breaking through enemy formations. It is rumored that the British army has so far captured more than 4,000 Italian troops and seized several medium tanks. British forces in the Qalabat area, with the assistance of artillery fire, are continuing to patrol the desert. The difficulty of this can be imagined. There are no orchards, food storage, livestock, or water plants in the desert, so the troops cannot obtain supplies in the occupied area, and every drop of water and every bite of food must be carried by the combat troops themselves. The difficulty of desert warfare was already demonstrated by the Italian invasion of Egypt this year. The Italian army was well-equipped and was able to quickly advance to Sidi Barrani, but its mobility was soon eroded by a sea of yellow sand. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters military correspondent stated that British forces in the western Egyptian desert have advanced 75 miles in one go, attacking the Italian army. The attacking British forces under General Wavell are mostly cavalry regiments in armored vehicles who go straight in and control the enemy. They have encountered at least two divisions of the Italian army under General Graziani's command and defeated them. These Italian forces held barracks in two areas, with strong defenses, but this British offensive has reached the seaside west of Sidi Barrani, and they are now encountering the main force of the Italian army. This group of Italian troops is well-equipped, with tanks and artillery. It has been building roads and stockpiling food, water, and ammunition for six months. The Libyan Italian army consists of three parts whites and two parts natives. Most of the natives are Libyans. Those in the front lines are mostly dead or captured. Therefore, the Italian white troops will now have to meet the British Empire's first-class troops composed of Australian, New Zealander, British, and Indian troops on the battlefield. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters special correspondent with the British army in Egypt reported that fighting is now taking place near Daqahsaia, fifteen miles southeast of Barrani. The village was subjected to heavy bombardment by the British fleet at the beginning of the battle. If the British army holds the positions in Buq Buq behind Barrani, then the route of retreat for a large number of Italian troops may be cut off. According to a British military spokesperson, the current battle is still in its early stages and has been extremely successful so far. (11th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Cairo - The British Air Force Command issued a communiqué stating that, according to the detailed report of the British Air Force assisting in the offensive, on the first day of the offensive, the British Air Force heavily bombed the enemy's airfields from Tobruk to Sidi Barrani, causing heavy damage. In addition, British aircraft constantly attacked the enemy army and motor transport teams concentrated in the combat area. It is rumored that 22 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, 18 of which have been confirmed, and 4 others have not yet been confirmed. One British aircraft team shot down 11 of them, 4 of which were burned on the ground at the same time. Another British aircraft team carried out a low-altitude strafing, causing heavy damage to enemy communications and casualties. Subsequently, British aircraft reconnaissance reported that large fires had broken out in several places west of Buq Buq, and enemy motor transport vehicles were also burning on the roads, causing the enemy army to become disorganized. British aircraft carried out these extensive aerial activities from dawn to evening. Only three aircraft did not return to base. The pilots of two of them have been rescued in British-held territory.

<p>London – British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated last night in a packed House of Commons that the British and Free French forces had advanced 75 miles in the desert, successfully concluding the initial stage of their military operations in this time of national crisis. The Prime Minister also recalled that months ago, he had explained to Parliament the threats to British positions in the Middle East following the collapse of France. However, when Secretary of State for War Eden visited the Middle East, reinforcements had arrived and were under the command of Middle East Commander-in-Chief General Wavell, sufficient to resume the offensive without worry. When Italy invaded Greece, the British Air Force in Egypt had to send several squadrons to aid the Greek forces. The victory of the Greek forces owes much to the British Air Force. However, the British Air Force in Egypt was temporarily reduced, and the offensive plan was implemented more slowly. On the night of December 7th, the large British and allied forces began to advance towards the Italian positions. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<p>Berlin – German Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels told foreign journalists yesterday that Germany would launch a massive blitz offensive in the near future, the ferocity of which would be unprecedented, bringing the fifteen-month European war to a swift end. This statement seemed to echo Hitler's speech yesterday, which stated, "Strike Britain daily until they sue for peace." The foreign journalists listening to Goebbels came mostly from Paris. Goebbels predicted that Britain's total defeat was imminent. He said, "In reality, we already feel that Germany has achieved victory, so Germany is now only focused on building a new European order. Germany is willing to establish cultural and economic relations with other places in the world, including America, which is what we desire most in our hearts." Goebbels then compared the English Channel to the Maginot Line, saying that Germany, after thorough preparation and detailed planning, could capture it as easily as turning one's hand. He also compared Churchill to former French Prime Minister Reynaud, saying that both knew that France could not resist a strong enemy, yet took a desperate gamble, and even deceived their people with lies of victory before their defeat. Goebbels also called such people similar to boxing match managers who know that their own fighter will be knocked down, but still claim that he will win. Goebbels called Britain "a nation that only knows how to eat butter and doesn't know how to make cannons." Now, even butter is unavailable. The German people have sacrificed butter for seven years to build the world's strongest army. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>London – After two days of quiet, London issued an air raid warning again this morning, but it was very brief. The only place where enemy aircraft were active in the evening was East Anglia. It is reported that the British Air Force attacked German long-range artillery positions at Cap Gris-Nez last night, after which there was an exchange of fire between the British and German artillery positions there yesterday morning. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London – An Air Ministry communique stated that British bombers heavily bombed a factory in La Lys, the Lorient naval base, and the docks of Bollogne on Monday night and Tuesday morning. British aircraft shot down one German aircraft. One British aircraft also did not return. German-occupied ports in France attacked by the British Air Force were on fire and burning fiercely. This morning, the sky over the English Channel was illuminated by the fire, all red. Subsequently, large fires broke out along the French coast, with flames soaring and thick smoke billowing, creating a spectacular sight. The area within and around Calais was ablaze.

<p>London – According to a highly reliable official source in a special report by the International News Service yesterday, the Soviet Union has sent a diplomatic note to Germany warning the Nazi government that if German troops attack Greece or Turkey via Bulgaria, the Soviet Union "cannot but be concerned." Germany seems to have decided not to send German troops through Bulgaria to aid Italy in attacking Greece, and this is widely believed to be the reason. The International News Service reporter also said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's recent visit to Berlin represents the biggest setback in German diplomacy in five years. It is reported that Molotov's visit to Germany was to declare the Soviet Union's will to Germany, rather than a convergence of the wills of the two countries. It is also said that although the Soviet Union seems to condemn Germany, Soviet-British relations may not necessarily improve as a result. The Soviet Union only recognizes that relations between the two countries "have not reached the worst stage." It is said that the Soviet Union holds this view because Britain seized ships in British ports belonging to the three Baltic states after the Soviet Union annexed them.

<p>Budapest – Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky left the capital at 11 o'clock last night on a regular express train for a return visit to the capital of Yugoslavia. Accompanying him were a large number of important officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. German Minister Erdmannsdorff and Italian Minister Barramo were at the station to see him off. Diplomatic circles here believe that the restoration of friendship between Hungary and Yugoslavia will lead to the signing of a treaty of friendship, non-aggression, and mutual consultation.

According to the Treaty of Trianon, the regions of Banat and Bačka in Hungary were ceded to Yugoslavia. Although the majority of the residents in these two regions are Yugoslav Serbs and Croats, they still include 680,000 Hungarian minorities.

<p>London – Sir David Beatty, President of the Chang Hing Shipping Company, recently sent an article to Reuters, detailing the company's contribution to the British Empire's war effort. He said that the company's current policy is to wholeheartedly cooperate with the British and Canadian governments to conduct the war, not only to the extent of its usual activities, but also willing to expand its scope to the production and machinery required for the training and equipping of modern armies. At the beginning of the war, the company was prepared to meet all needs, and the efficiency of transporting troops and materials is improving daily. Recently, the Canadian Minister of National Defence expressed unlimited admiration for the company's handling of troop movements. There are almost no restrictions on the various conveniences and facilities for handling traffic, so there is no congestion. In addition, considerable success has been achieved in the speed of transport. The company's ships occupy an important part in the war activities of the merchant fleet. As one of the representatives of Canadian-British shipping affairs, I know very well the glorious achievements of the merchant fleet, but I cannot disclose them. However, I can say that the company's ships have sailed into enemy territorial waters, transported troops back and forth in various parts of the Empire, and transported enemy prisoners to Canada for detention. All the staff of the company are willing to work, struggle, and sacrifice their lives for their freedom, and sacrifice their money and happiness. The current war is a war of free people, and I firmly believe that free people will achieve the final victory. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3 id="e46">The Truth About Britain and France's Hasty Entry into the War <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Hitler took Chamberlain to his bedroom, accompanied only by the translator Schmidt. The room was very small, with only an iron bed inside. A very exquisite painting, sent from the Munich Museum and changed from time to time, hung on the wall. When Hitler spoke, he was truly eloquent, never stopping, leaving no room for interruption. Chamberlain could only stare blankly at him, speechless.</p>
<p>Chamberlain also told me that when he met Hitler for the second time in Godesberg, Hitler was still speaking non-stop, like a river bursting its banks. He thought that even if such talks continued, they would be useless. Moreover, every few minutes, an officer would come in to deliver a telegram—this was clearly a planned scheme. After reading it, Hitler would roar in uncontrollable anger: "The blood spilled by the Germans must be avenged, the Czechs must be annihilated!" His rage was constantly increasing. Whether he was genuine or not, he said to the translator: "It's better to stop the conversation, I'm going back to the hotel." The hotel was on the other side of the Rhine River, so he had to take a boat. When he said goodbye, Hitler continued to roar and escort the guest until they reached the riverbank. Suddenly, he stopped speaking and immediately changed his expression. Looking at the river under his feet, he said in a very gentle voice: "I originally wanted to show you the beautiful scenery on this river, but now it is covered by fog…" His ability to transform, one moment as angry as thunder, the next moment gentle and refined, changing so quickly that he seemed like a different person, was truly something never seen before.</p>
<p>A member of the Foreign Office who accompanied Chamberlain to Germany told me that the Prime Minister was deeply pained by these two talks. Hitler's rage was something he had never seen in his life. Therefore, if someone mentioned Hitler's name in front of him, he would show an embarrassed face, like a child being forced to drink castor oil. But on Chamberlain's part, he believed that he had an unshirkable responsibility to preserve peace, and he always hoped to fulfill his wish.</p>
<p>He received countless letters from men and women in Britain and France, which increased his faith. Thousands upon thousands of rural women in France sent him letters of thanks, thanking him for saving the country from war, families from bombing, and children from death. There were also many old women who knitted gloves with woolen yarn and sent them to him, with shaky, large letters saying: "Prime Minister, wearing these gloves will keep your hands from getting cold when you are on an airplane." All these expressions touched Mrs. Chamberlain infinitely. She was a kind-hearted woman and strongly urged her husband to continue on the path of appeasement.</p>
<p>After the Munich Conference, this path of compromise was no longer supported by the British people. Originally, the British army and air force were unprepared, so public opinion had no choice but to accept the results of the Munich Conference. But the British Empire had tasted bitterness and knew that this matter was somewhat dishonorable, so it resolved never to submit to humiliation again, regardless of any sacrifice. In January 1939, I went to Britain to attend a series of meetings, traveling almost all over the island. I realized that British public opinion was more advanced than the government. Although Britain urgently needed to implement conscription, the government was still hesitant, but the people were actively demanding it. British people all over Britain, regardless of gender or class, told me: "We can never allow Hitler to rule Europe, and we must build a large army and a strong air force."</p>
<p>When I returned to Paris, I wrote an article saying that Britain would implement conscription in March. At that time, many French friends said that I was a fool talking in my sleep. They said that compulsory military service violated the traditional habits of the British people and that the British would never adopt it. But in March 1939, Britain did indeed implement conscription.</p>
<p>When the German army invaded the Czech city, Chamberlain and the leading figures who supported the policy of appeasement were dealt a heavy blow. The shock of this British Prime Minister was not contrived. He had always firmly believed that Hitler would never annex non-German races, but now he had received evidence to the contrary. He suddenly changed his plans and turned into a strong opponent of Hitler. He was filled with shame and anger and, unexpectedly, gave Poland a guarantee. At that time, I was in the United States, and upon hearing the news, I said to myself, "This will inevitably lead to war." On the one hand, Germany would continue its ambition to expand its territory and would inevitably annex Poland; on the other hand, Britain would never abandon the solemn treaty it had signed, as it had shown throughout its history. With each side going to extremes, the war could not be averted.</p>
<p>Britain suddenly found itself in a situation of complex European entanglements, and it had no choice but to have a closer understanding with France. In June 1939, the Anglo-French alliance held a formal banquet in Paris, attended by British Secretary of State for War Hore-Belisha, French Foreign Minister Bonnet, and General Gamelin. Hore-Belisha declared on the spot that once war broke out, the British army would be under the command of the French commander-in-chief, and that he would be fortunate enough to say, "Our General Gamelin." As soon as he finished speaking, applause erupted and lasted for a long time, but General Gamelin remained silent. After the banquet, Hore-Belisha and we went to the Polish Embassy, where a dance party was being held. Hore-Belisha's trip was nothing more than to show that Britain and Poland had a new bond.</p>
<p>Every time I recall this experience, I cannot help but feel sad. It was midsummer, and the night was intoxicating. In the garden of the Polish Embassy, ​​white marble sphinxes shone under the stars, the orchestra played waltzes, and the lights were brilliant. On the lawn, many beautiful girls were dancing with Polish and French officers. The two daughters of the German ambassador were also among them. We all believed that war was imminent, and Poland would bear the brunt. This dance party seemed similar to the dance party held by Wellington in Brussels on the eve of the Battle of Waterloo! That night, the guests raised their glasses, talked and laughed, and discussed unrelated trivia. They talked about the maiden voyage of the Pasteur, and several people who were preparing to go to South America used their travel plans as conversation material.</p>
<p>A few days later, Hore-Belisha came to Paris again, accompanied by Colonel ——, his adjutant, to prepare to watch the French National Day parade on July 14th. Churchill was also traveling with him. That day was a grand occasion and the last day of joy in Paris. The French army had never had such a magnificent military appearance. Inspected were light cavalry, light infantry, naval infantry, foreign legions, and regular troops. Everything that was glorious in France was revealed in this grand review. Churchill smiled and said, "Thank God, France actually has such an army." At that time, who would have thought that that kind of morale, discipline, and the reputation of the best army would be rendered useless due to insufficient mechanical equipment! At that time, the tanks meandered along, and the viewers were moved, but they did not understand the situation in Germany. Who knew that Germany had more tanks, thicker armor, and could not be subdued by French artillery!</p>
<p>That afternoon, Hore-Belisha and his adjutant, Colonel ——, came to Neuilly to see me. He told me about the various difficulties he had encountered in training the British army.</p>
<p>He said, "Conscription is indeed good, but now it is just empty words and has no practical effect. Although many people are registered, they have neither equipment nor officers to train them, so there is no way to gather them together for training."</p>
<p>I asked, "Where have the officers from the Great War gone?"</p>
<p>"They don't know how to use new weapons!"</p>
<p>"If war breaks out tomorrow, how many divisions can you send to help us?"</p>
<p>"Immediately? I'm afraid it won't exceed six divisions."</p>
<p>This number startled me. Soon I learned that the French General Staff had requested only thirty-two divisions from Britain during the entire European war, which shocked me even more. I recalled that in 1918, in addition to the Allied Powers of the United States, Russia, Italy, and Japan, the British army had 85 divisions participating in the war. France's victory was still a narrow one. It is no wonder that it caused my surprise. At that time, the Foreign Office feared Bonnet's opinion and agreed with me. I retraced the following event to him: (To be continued) The grand occasion on the Champs-Élysées in Paris before the war.</p>

<p>Washington: It is reported here that individuals recognize Hitler's speech near Berlin yesterday as nothing less than an admission of the failure to invade England. Observers here believe that the purpose of Hitler's speech was to reassure German public opinion, fearing that the failure of the blitz against England and the defeats of Italy would discredit him. Observers also believe that Hitler's speech was an open admission that there is no hope for peace negotiations in the near future. The mention of the United States in the speech was aimed at stabilizing domestic morale and preventing panic due to active American aid to England. Commentators also pointed out that Hitler's speech did not mention a single word about Italy's failure in the war of aggression against Greece. (United Press dispatch, November 11)</p>
<p>Washington: It is reported here that Hitler's remarks in Berlin yesterday had a dual nature: one was a provocative speech to munitions workers, and the other was a challenge to all countries around the world, whether belligerent or not, that oppose Nazi economics. Hitler's declaration of war on capitalism anywhere in the world was directed specifically at Britain and the United States, and he acknowledged that although the United States is not a belligerent, it is in fact backing Britain in the war. The need for German workers to hear this lengthy and provocative speech is also considered noteworthy. (Reuters dispatch, November 11)</p>
<p>New York: German leader Hitler told the German people yesterday that if the Germans win, the world will belong to them. Hitler's lengthy speech from the top of the steel platform in a Berlin armaments factory clearly indicated his intentions and goals after a victory in the air war against England, with a clarity unmatched by previous speeches. Hitler said that gold would become useless and worthless, and that aristocratic politics would be swept away in Germany, replaced by labor politics. Most of Hitler's speech was to assure the German people that the hardships and sacrifices they had endured in the difficult years before the war, and in the months when Hitler believed that British bombing had affected the German people, would definitely be rewarded. However, what is significant is that Hitler's speech was broadcast by radio throughout Europe, to strife-torn Romania, to ambiguous Bulgaria, to Southern countries fearing the ravages of war, and to every household throughout Germany. To the residents of continental Europe, Hitler announced the goals of the war; to England, he announced that the end was near. In the past, when Hitler made speeches, except when speaking to his old comrades in Munich, he almost always led the German people in making statements to the parliaments and political giants of various countries. However, Hitler's speech yesterday was definitely directed internally, intended to inform the masses of the Nazi Party that there were rich rewards of fame and fortune under the bombers. Germany's war against England has been ongoing for years, and its people must constantly be stimulated and encouraged so that they can continue to fight. However, Hitler's promise to his people that their sacrifices and efforts would be compensated is still a first. Since the beginning of the war, Hitler has only made empty threats and boasted that he would immediately defeat England and all of Germany's enemies. However, it should not be ignored that Hitler reportedly planned to have lunch at Buckingham Palace between August 15 of this year, and had told his confidants that he would taste the experience when the time came for him to cross the sea to his liking.

<p>(Continued from Previous)</p>
<p>We have such firm confidence in the final success of national armaments. If my waiting for the opportunity can reduce sacrifices, then the whole country will definitely be able to express understanding and gratitude to me. We are not attacking for prestige. We have a certain military procedure. What should be done first is done, and what should not be done is avoided. However, we still hope that there will be a time to restore reason, restore peace, Germany will not be defeated militarily or economically, time is not harmful to Germany, Germany will definitely win. There is no word of surrender in my dictionary. I am not afraid of fighting. As long as I have a breath left, I will swear to continue to the end.</p>
<p>Hitler then recounted the course of the National Socialist Party's revolution, saying that when the National Socialist Party's revolution was launched, we had two major goals: one was to unify the German nation. We must first achieve this goal before we can realize the demands vital to Germany's survival. In 1932, Germany had eight million unemployed workers, insufficient food and clothing, and many deaths. The National Socialist Party struggled to unify the German nation, overcoming many difficulties, initially with the resistance of the intellectual class of the upper class. This could not be resolved by force. At that time, I realized that it was necessary to restore the society of the German nation before this could be done. So I moved towards the set goal. The second was to eliminate the oppression of foreign politics, which is the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty prevented the unification of the German nation and deprived Germany of its colonies. Therefore, our second goal was to fight against the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler said to this point, then put forward democratic politics, saying that the democratic politics of Britain and the United States are almost entirely monopolized by capitalists. Hundreds of capitalists who own countless properties, their so-called freedom, not only refers to obtaining capital, but also implies being free from national control. Each capitalist competes to publish newspapers, creating public opinion to promote its policies, and represents various political parties. This is called democratic politics. In this country of freedom and wealth, there are both the rich and the poor, which is hard to believe. The class division in Britain is extremely strict, and the contrast between the rich and the poor is also very obvious. I have never seen them take any solutions. In countries that control the world's wealth, the living conditions of workers are even more unbearable. Although the country is rich and prosperous, the unemployment problem has not been solved. Even in wealthy Britain, there have been 2.5 million unemployed, and this has often been the case for decades. In the wealthy United States, the number of unemployed often ranges between 10 million and 13 million. France also has no less than 800,000 unemployed. The facts are there, what else can be said? Labor Party members in the British cabinet once said happily, "This will engage in socially valuable undertakings after the decision of the war. British workers will have the ability to travel and be idle." Little did they know that Germany had already solved this problem. Often, a small number of rulers are selfish and self-interested in their hearts, but they use democratic principles as a banner. They know very well that we will not harm their cloth countries. What they fear is that if the ideals popular in Germany are not rejected, they will flow into their country, reforming the people's ideas, making them unwilling to obey. In short, in the capitalist world, there is one most important economic law: people must work for industry and commerce. As for the operation of industry and commerce, it is to seek the welfare of capitalists. As for national socialism, it is the opposite. The people are the most important, and everything else is just a tool to achieve the goal. I myself am not interested in high profits. A 6% interest rate is not too little for anyone. The British also said, "We are fighting to maintain the gold standard." Little did they know that the Germans also once possessed gold. After I took control of the country, because there was no gold in Germany, I became isolated from the gold standard and changed my concept, taking our working ability as gold. Although our mark has no gold as its backing, it is still always stable because its labor is its backing.</p>
<p>Hitler continued, "All those who have the intention to abolish national socialist countries and destroy the German nation are now beginning to be taught a lesson. For example, Poland initially wanted to subdue Germany. As a result, it was conquered by Germany in eighteen days. It was decided that Britain had an attempt to invade Norway, and then the war on the Western Front broke out. Our army launched an offensive. At that time, the old people in our country were half suspicious and fearful, thinking that the Maginot Line was indestructible. As a result, the war ended in six weeks. I do not intend to carry out night raids in the air war. Therefore, during the war in Poland, German aircraft did not go on night raids. The purpose of the German air force's operations was to attack military targets, not to harm civilians, women, and children. Therefore, night raids were not carried out during the war in France. However, Churchill adopted unrestricted air force tactics against Germany, but as a result, German factories did not suffer any losses. Those who suffered were the unfortunate civilians. There is no shortage of idiots in the world who think that Germany will be in turmoil and disintegrate. Little do they know that the Third Reich is far from the Second Reich. We are fighting for the future, for the happiness of all the people. We already have concrete plans. The state organized by the German people will become more consolidated. Any obstacles that hinder the development of talented people will be eliminated. We are determined to establish a socialist country. We will not consider it a success until we achieve our goal. At that time, we will show the world which is the true master: capital or labor." Hitler concluded, "It is more difficult to be the leader of Germany from an unknown soldier and to seek peace than to have the qualifications of the leader of Germany. What is there to fear if the goal is achieved?" (Haitong News Agency dispatch, November 10)</p>

<p>The Fourth Shenbao Cup Sino-US Charity Basketball Tournament, jointly organized by Shenbao, the English-language Great American Evening News, and the YMCA, has been scheduled for the 17th, 19th, and 21st of this month (i.e., next Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) at 8:00 PM in the YMCA gymnasium on Jing'an Temple Road. The selection of the Chinese team has attracted much attention from all parties. In order to take into account the actual difficulties, the organizing authorities decided to invite Chen Xianglong, Li Zhenzhong, and 14 other players by Shenbao to represent the Chinese team, and hired Zhou Jiaqi, Ling Xitao, and Qian Xucang as consultants to the Chinese team, and Lu Zhongen as the manager of the Chinese team. According to Shenbao Cup, the American team won the cup last year. This year's Chinese team is full of talent, concentrating the elite of all Shanghai Chinese teams, and will definitely win glory for the country, make a good start, and win back this glorious cup. The full team roster is listed below:</p>
<p>(Consultants) Zhou Jiaqi, Ling Xitao, Qian Xucang (Manager) Lu Zhongen (Players) Chen Xianglong, Li Zhenzhong, Lu Zhongen, Chen Xuechong, Feng Nianhua, Ren Xiangcheng, Zhang Shaoqing, Bao Songyuan, Sun Huipei, Liang Yunming, Lu Gusui, Wang Nanqun, Wang Nanzhen, Chen Bangzhen.</p>
<h3 id="e51">13th YMCA Basketball; Scheduled to Open Next Monday Evening; Youlian Basketball Team Withdraws, Leaving Only 10 Teams; Opening Game Baillemon vs. Shangxing <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The 13th YMCA Invitational Basketball League has been scheduled to open next Monday (the 16th) evening. The registration results from the previous week showed that 15 teams participated: Baillemon, Huaxing, Huxing, Liangxi, Youlian, Blue Team, Shangxing, Huabu, Zhongyi, Tianxing, Xiaoxiong, Juren, Mailing Military Officer, Mailing White Team, and Mailing Red Team. Later, Huabu, Zhongyi, and Tianxing and other three teams, their strength did not meet the standards. The review results only approved 12 Chinese and Western teams to participate. Now Youlian due to small formalities and incomplete, and the Blue Team due to insufficient players announced their withdrawal one after another. Therefore, the YMCA basketball, originally limited to 12 teams, now has only 10 teams competing. Among these ten strong teams, Chinese and Western teams are evenly divided, and their strengths are also comparable. Therefore, the performance of this year's YMCA League is expected to be more exciting than previous years. This year's Western teams, the strength of Mailing White is still better than Mailing Red. The military officers are also very strong. Xiaoxiong has Carson's assistance and is obviously extraordinary. The giants are just so-so. On the Chinese team side, Huaxing appeared as a dark horse, with both voice and appearance. However, it is still uncertain whether Cai Yanxiong and Zhou Daxiao can come to Shanghai. Wang Nanzhen and Nanqun brothers are still playing for Liangxi. On the Huxing side, the loss of Chen Xuechong will naturally have a great impact. Shangxing's strength is still at the standard. Although Baillemon lost Li Bao, talents can still be deployed and still maintain its status as a giant. This year's YMCA ticket prices are one yuan upstairs and two yuan downstairs. The first four weeks of the order are recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e55">The Catholic Church in China; Overview of Five Major Cultural Undertakings (5); (3) Xujiahui Observatory <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>In the 17th century, the history of Catholic missionaries taking turns entering astronomy is well known to modern people. Anyone who has visited the Forbidden City Museum will definitely remember the astronomical instruments made by Nan Huairen and others. In modern times, science has become more advanced, and the Catholic Church's scientific research has not allowed others to excel. The Catholic Church believes that researching science is to seek truth, so religion and science complement each other and there is absolutely no conflict.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Xujiahui Observatory dates back to the twelfth year of Tongzhi (1873), and it has been 67 years since then. At that time, the Shanghai International Chamber of Commerce requested Father P. Dechevrens to set up an observatory to predict hurricanes because ships entering and leaving often suffered from wind disasters. Father Wen immediately agreed, only asking for free telegrams to be sent to various observatories.</p>
<p>After Father Wen, the successors were Father Cai P. Chevalliee, Father Lao P. Froe, and the current Father Yan P. Lejay. The current organization of the Xujiahui Observatory can be briefly described as follows: Director Father Yan presides over everything, but because he often has to go out to test the earth's gravity (Father Yan invented the earth's gravity testing pendulum, which helped the Chinese government with land surveying and mapping, with excellent results), he does not spend much time at the station. Under the director, there are Father Zhong Qianmao P. Dumas, Father Long Pherzi, and Father Bu P. Burgand of the Xujiahui Meteorological Station, who are responsible for climate, earthquakes, electromagnetism, and timekeeping, respectively. Father Wei P. do Lovielemerque of Sheshan Observatory is dedicated to astronomy. The electromagnetism department was originally also set up in Xujiahui. Later, Shanghai laid trams, which had an impact on the magnetic force, so it was moved to Luxiabin in a few days in the third year of Guangxu (1877). After the August 13th war, it was moved to Sheshan again. Therefore, the Xujiahui Observatory, which is commonly referred to today, actually includes Xujiahui and Sheshan. Strictly speaking, Xujiahui is a meteorological station, and Sheshan is a true astronomical observatory.</p>
<p>The most important work of the Xujiahui Observatory is meteorological reporting, which includes standard time and earthquakes. Meteorological reports are published four times a day, but more than 200 reports are received every day. The reporting agencies can be divided into land reporting stations (such as Chinese coastal customs reporting stations, domestic government reporting stations, and foreign reporting stations) and active reporting stations of marine merchant ships and warships. There are more than 50 land reporting stations. In the event of a hurricane, warnings will be issued on the Bund of the French Concession. In the past six or seventy years, the number of Chinese coastal hurricanes that have occurred has totaled more than 1,000, and the number of warships and merchant ships that have been saved from disaster is countless. The letters of thanks and commendation, souvenirs, etc., received by the observatory are also difficult to enumerate. The late Father Lao also had the title of "Father of Hurricanes." The observatory also has two new-style timekeeping instruments. The temperature and pressure of the storage place are specially designed and cannot be changed. Therefore, the timekeeping error cannot exceed one-hundredth of a second per day. At noon and 9:00 PM every day, the time is broadcast by radio. In October of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, the International Astronomical Association also designated Africa's Yalki, the United States' San Diego, and Xujiahui as standard timekeeping locations. The Xujiahui seismograph was established relatively late, but the equipment is extremely sophisticated. There are one Wieehert horizontal seismograph and one Galitzin vertical seismograph each. Therefore, Xujiahui's earthquake research also occupies an important position in the world. In the past ten years, the prediction of the two major earthquakes in North China has been the most important record.</p>
<p>The Sheshan Observatory was founded in 1900 and is equipped with two equatorial instruments with a length of seven meters and a lens diameter of 40 minutes, one for observation and one for photography. The successful work of the Sheshan Observatory over the years has been the study of sunspots. It has taken 12,000 photos and determined the positions of 14,000 celestial bodies, studied 1,200 binary stars and clusters, and calculated more than 100 instances of Jupiter disrupting the orbits of other planets. The reason why the Sheshan Observatory has achieved this result is that its Wangda telescope can increase the light of the fourth magnitude by a full twelve degrees of light. The personnel of the Xujiahui Observatory have also made several inland exploration trips and explorations of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and have drawn 54 maps and determined the locations of 50 cities. In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, at the request of the Chinese government, Father Hui's invention of the earth's gravity testing instrument was brought from Shanghai to Guizhou for testing. At that time, many highways had not been completed, but they were finally able to overcome the difficulties and finally succeeded. In recent years, the newly established Nantong Observatory, Qingdao Observatory, and Central Meteorological Observatory in China have either been assisted by the Observatory in installing and constructing equipment or trained personnel. The contribution to modern science in China is by no means insignificant. Those who say that religion hinders thinking and prevents the progress of material civilization can realize this.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Foodstuffs A Large Shipment of Foreign Rice Arrives Yesterday, Severely Impacting Speculative Trading, Market Prices Show Slight Decline <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a large quantity of foreign rice arrived. The French company's postal ship "Dat De Nan" was confirmed to have directly loaded 7,000 tons from Saigon, as reported earlier. It is now known that the ship arrived in Shanghai at noon yesterday and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. It carried over 71,500 bags of foreign rice, which are currently being unloaded. Furthermore, Jardine Matheson's "Yusheng" ship brought 2,091 bags from Hong Kong, and the "Fusheng" ship also brought 1,459 bags from Hong Kong. Both ships arrived yesterday morning and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. The "Fusheng" ship had an additional 1,125 bags to be transshipped to Qingdao and another 239 bags to be shipped to Tianjin. Additionally, Taikoo's "Taiyuan" ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and also carried 989 bags from Hong Kong, docking at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. Unloading was completed yesterday. The amount of foreign rice arriving in Shanghai yesterday was substantial.</p>
<p>Since the rice market experienced price limits and subsequent declines, the market sentiment yesterday remained weak. Most people still aimed to sell quickly. Therefore, the market opened weakly. General speculators competed to sell, but buying interest was lacking. Not only were shops hesitant to make actual purchases, but speculative trading was also quiet, resulting in a lack of counter-offers and falling prices. However, it was difficult to attract buyers because the market had been excessively inflated previously, and a sudden decline was bound to be severe. As a result, the market continued to weaken. According to statistics, at the close, foreign rice prices were more than 1.5 yuan lower than the previous session. For example, No. 1 Saigon was sold for 85 yuan but dropped to 83.5 yuan, No. 2 was 78 yuan but dropped to 76 yuan, No. 1 Siam was 80 yuan but dropped to 79.3 yuan, No. 2 was 76 yuan but dropped to 75.8 yuan, Xiaojiao was 75.5 yuan but dropped to 75 yuan, Milu was 72.8 yuan but dropped to 72 yuan, Broken Rice was 70.05 yuan to 68 yuan, and Wuchao Jian was 75 yuan but dropped to 73 yuan.</p>
<p>Thick and thin Jing Guomi (polished rice) saw sluggish sales as most customers refrained from buying due to the continuous decline of foreign rice prices. Selling prices continued to drop by about 1 yuan. Kunshan Jian Baijing opened at 95.5 yuan but dropped to 92 yuan, Jiate Jing was 98 yuan, and Thin Dao Yuanbao was 92-93 yuan, Jian was 88 yuan, 87 yuan.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice followed the trend of other goods, declining by more than 1 yuan. Yi Li Baiyuan was 95 yuan, 93-94 yuan, Hong Kong Baiyuan was 85 yuan, 82 yuan, and Nuolu was 74 yuan to 70 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e60">With the Arrival of Foreign Flour, Flour Prices Gradually Soften <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Wheat flour prices softened yesterday. The No. 2 Flour Mill's price remained at 18 yuan, and over 6,000 bags of regulated-price flour were allocated according to regulations. With the current abundance of foreign flour, local customers mostly shifted to foreign flour. As a result, the local flour market had been sluggish for some time. However, yesterday, rice prices continued to fall, and news of the imminent arrival of the third batch of Australian flour spread widely. The market sentiment was weak and unstable. Returned goods, such as Bell Tower Flower and Bird Brand Australian flour, were sold for only 19.8 yuan, down another 0.1 yuan from the previous day. Road transport transactions also gradually became sluggish. The total market transaction was only over 1,000 bags. It is heard that a total of 300,000 bags of Australian and American flour will arrive this month. At that time, the future of rice flour is expected to be suppressed.</p>
<p>Wheat remained sluggish yesterday. Only 200-300 bags of domestic wheat arrived daily, all designated for delivery to Japanese factories. Although the price of stored goods in the concession reached 30 yuan, there was still a lack of supply. Chinese factories and customers, seeing the declining situation of foreign flour, were reluctant to purchase. Therefore, the market entered a stalemate again.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Finance Foreign Exchange Meanders <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Foreign exchange market conditions: The HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The black market exchange rates for British and American currencies remained unchanged. The trend has consistently meandered between 5.9375 and 5.96875 for US dollars, which has been the case for some time. This is because political and other news are insufficient to stimulate market sentiment. Speculators have disappeared in the past two days. However, the Bank of Japan continued to offer, and Chinese banks also sold. The American banks and foreign banks had relatively strong demand. The market eventually recovered from loose to stable. As a result, the British and American exchange rates remained uniformly unchanged at 5.9375 and 3.765625 respectively. Swap rates also remained flat.</p>
<p>Uniform and Indistinguishable</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London exchange rate for both near-term and long-term was 3.1875. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price remained stable. The exchange rates for British, American, and Shanghai currencies were all flat, and the exchange rates for American to British and Shanghai currencies also did not change. The central bank's listed exchange rates, such as banks, began selling spot goods. The exchange rate for British gold was 3.765625, and the exchange rate for US dollars was 5.9375, which was the same as the closing market price last night. After the opening, the market was stable with a firm undertone. This was because the Bank of Japan began to sell. It is estimated that Anda Holland and Youli absorbed the US dollar for the current month at 5.96875. HSBC's listed price remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was increased by 1.00%. Later, the Chinese Commercial Bank also intended to sell, selling the US dollar for the current month to the American Bank at 5.96875. By noon, the American Bank's demand was not weak, and the potential returned to equilibrium. The noon closing prices for spot British gold were all 3.765625, and the US dollar was 5.9375. Compared to the previous day, the exchange rates for both British and American currencies were indistinguishable. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Rate Stable</p>
<p>Hong Kong, November 11 (Wednesday) Telegraph: The exchange market opened flat today. The exchange rates for British, American, and Japanese currencies did not fluctuate. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai dollars decreased by 0.5 yuan to 396 yuan. At 10:30, it was stable. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai dollars increased by 1.5 yuan to 397.5 yuan. At 11:30, it closed flat. The spot exchange rate for Shanghai dollars decreased by 0.5 yuan to 397 yuan. The rest remained unchanged. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin Market Also Unchanged</p>
<p>Tianjin, November 11 (Wednesday) Telegraph: The exchange market opened sluggish today. The telegraphic transfer rates for London and New York did not fluctuate. The Shanghai exchange rate also remained at the original level. Only the black market exchange rate for "United Currency" was slightly lower by 0.25 yuan, at 88.75 yuan.</p>

<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Dry Tobacco (2)</p>
<p>There is a saying that "Little Tartars knock on damp tobacco." In the early years, there were clay sculptures on the market depicting Qing officials with short beards, holding pipes, and smoking, which were used as toys for children. This shows the popularity of smoking among the Manchus. Among the Han Chinese, during the Kangxi period, Prime Minister Chen Yuanlong of Hai'ning and Prime Minister Shi Yizhi of Liyang were both known for smoking, which was even spread by the Qing Shengzu. Because Chen and Shi were related by marriage and both enjoyed smoking, the Shengzu disliked it and gifted them crystal pipes. They were delighted, considering it a special honor. However, when they used them to smoke, the smoke went straight to their throats, causing them to choke so much that they dared not smoke again. The Shengzu also issued a ban on smoking. Jiang Tingxi wrote a poem about it:</p>
<p>Green bowls and jade ladles wash open,</p>
<p>Feasts have already forbidden deep cups;</p>
<p>After the Yaochi banquet, the cloud screens open,</p>
<p>No human smoke is allowed to come.</p>
<p>However, those who banned banned, and those who smoked smoked. Judging from the shortage of coins during the Yongzheng period, it can be seen that the trend of smoking was still prevalent at that time.</p>
<p>At that time, each coin weighed 1.4 qian, and the lightest was 1 qian. One tael of silver could only be exchanged for 840 cash. Melting it into copper, the heavy ones weighed more than 7 jin and could be sold for 2-3 taels of silver to make bronze ware. At that time, many people used tobacco pouches. Although the item was small, destroying 10 coins could make a tobacco pouch worth over 100 coins. Dishonest people could make a profit of ten times, so melting coins to make tobacco pouches was common. However, these so-called tobacco pouches were not water pipes but dry pipes, so they only weighed a little over one tael. However, it is enough to prove that there were many smokers, even affecting the coins.</p>
<p>During the Qianlong period, the most famous smoker among the court officials was Ji Xiaolan, known as "Big Pipe Ji." His pipe was very large, and one pipe of tobacco could be smoked from home to the court. One day, while on duty and smoking, he suddenly heard that he was summoned. He hurriedly inserted the pipe into his boot, rushed in to report, and after a long time, the fire burned his socks. In great pain, he couldn't help but sob. The emperor was surprised and asked him. He replied: "There is water running in my boot," because Northerners call fire "running water." He was quickly dismissed. By the time he took off his boot outside the door, the smoke was billowing, and his skin was scorched.</p>
<p>As for wealthy families at that time, such as the Jia family in the Dream of the Red Chamber, smoking was rarely seen. Only in chapter 101, Xue Baochai handed Sister Feng a bag of tobacco. This bag was definitely dry tobacco. However, in The Gallant Maidens and Knights, which depicts the families of banner people, Madam An smoked constantly, and Zhang Jinfeng and Aunt Chu also smoked. This shows that banner people liked to smoke the most, and the trend of smoking had become popular among the people. There were even officials who could not do without tobacco. For example, when Liu Wending of Wujin was down on his luck, he was so poor that he was starving. He begged for tobacco from his neighbor with a bamboo pipe. The neighbor mocked him, saying, "Tobacco relieves hunger, don't eat too much." He smiled and accepted it, mocking him for being hungry and smoking, which would only make him hungrier.</p>
<p>Tobacco pouches were made of various materials, including pure copper, pure silver, ivory, ebony, rosewood, rattan, and bamboo. However, metal pouches easily conduct heat, wooden pouches easily break, rattan is upright but too soft, and ivory is good but not durable. Silver and copper can only be used to make small pouches and do not easily absorb tobacco oil. Therefore, bamboo is the most suitable for dry tobacco pouches. First, it is long and thin. Second, it is straight. Third, it does not break easily. Fourth, the pipe wall easily absorbs tobacco oil. Generally, those who use bamboo or wood to make tobacco pouches use copper, ivory, or material for the mouthpiece, which varies. However, the bowl at the bottom for burning tobacco must be made of copper. When smoking dry tobacco, the mouthpiece is held in the mouth. Metal is durable, but it is too hard and easily damages teeth. Therefore, ivory is the most suitable because it is hard but flexible. When holding tobacco in the bowl and removing the remaining ashes, it must be tapped, so even using metal is still easily corroded. In the old days, a sachet or a lacquered wooden tobacco pouch was hung on the pouch to store tobacco. However, the simplest way to smoke is to use a thin bamboo tube, only about a foot long, with the nodes removed. One end is carved into a small funnel shape to hold tobacco. When smoking, one hand holds the pipe between the index and ring fingers, and the other hand picks up tobacco leaves between the thumb and index finger. The other hand uses the two fingers to take tobacco, blow paper to ignite the tobacco (paper blows are also called coal heads, which are made of熟paper rolled into strips, easy to blow with coal), blowing, sucking, and tapping leisurely, making viewers envious. This is what is meant by knocking damp tobacco (to be continued).</p>

Before long, the silver shop continued to match 20 taels, falling another 2 yuan to 5,748 yuan, a complete collapse. However, soon after, hearing that the foreign exchange market had stabilized, the buying sentiment slightly moved, and the gold shop also took advantage of the cheap price to buy in. Qian Duiye Silver Shop jointly purchased, pulling the price up to 5,777 yuan, with the Silver Shop entering Qian Duiye for 30 taels.

<p>Yesterday's oil market, first, because the spot market was sluggish and the market price was humiliated, resulting in half of the interest being hit, and secondly, the rice price was loose again, the soybean market was mediocre and lacked spirit, the people's hearts were inevitably floating, and the general speculation of grabbing hats sought to emerge, so the selling wind was strong, and the market price was downstream, resulting in the near term falling by nearly three yuan from the previous day, and the far term falling by two yuan, a total of 30 pieces of spot Yantai soybean oil were traded, and the price was 78.5 yuan, Dayou factory soybean oil was 100 dan, the price was 85 yuan, Jiaozhou Xinsheng oil was 200 pieces, the price was 83 yuan, Qingdao raw oil was 80 barrels, the price was 112 yuan, 2 jiao to 110 yuan, a total of 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil for delivery in December, the price was 108 yuan, a total of more than 1,200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil for delivery in December, the price was 113 yuan to 110 yuan, a total of 900 barrels for delivery in February, the price was 110 yuan, 2 jiao and 5 fen to 109</p>

<p>The securities market still failed to continue its upswing yesterday. Although there was a large amount of absorption by buyers, sellers continued to supply, causing the market price to fall instead of rise. It can be seen that large bullish holders have been seeking a way to emerge, and they have been selling off whenever there is a large exchange demand. Therefore, the future may not be easily excited for a while. The continuous success of large loans has not helped the price of government bonds. Contrary to the previous usual practice, there must be a period of excitement whenever a loan is established. Yesterday, Shanghai Da Yisheng bought more than 700,000, and Dazhonghua, Yizhong, Shunkang also absorbed 200,000 to 300,000. Maoyi, Dahong, and Dazhong also bought in a lot, and there were still scattered buyers buying in an endless stream. However, sellers Lianyi, Datong, and Lianhe continued to supply in the morning and evening, and the amount supplied by Yu Rutongji, Shuntai, Sankai, Wanchun, Yitai, Xiexing, and Yuanyuan was no more than the same, so the market price was still from high to low, and there was no upswing. As a result, Fuxing fell back to 5 fen, 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half, and the total number of transactions was 1.56 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 200 shares of Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory stock were traded, and the price was 29 yuan, 2 jiao and a half.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market of Zhongye Gongsuo opened still quiet, and the people's hearts were slightly better after entering, but the transaction was still sparse, and there was no special change in price worth mentioning, only the Xinhuo stock once rose to 8 yuan and 6 jiao, and at the same time, the plush stock at 6 yuan and 8 jiao cattle, the price can also stand firm,</p>

<p>The yarn market, which has been continuous for several days, was slightly frustrated yesterday.

<p>Shuangma Chen opened, because the popularity in the afternoon of the previous day was unusually enthusiastic, and the first plate continued to move forward, the price of 20 Shuangma was 1,290 yuan, at this time the buying sound vibrated, and in a short time it rose directly to 1,297 yuan, but on October 22, the peak had reached 1,302 yuan, and some speculators saw that it had not yet broken through, so it might as well spit out the bullish, and then returned to 1,280 yuan, but the price was fatigued, and the buying wind rose again, and it rose to 1,296 yuan, but the second time it failed to rise out of the customs, so the users who grabbed hats sold out one after another, and the market continued to decline to 1,281 yuan at the close, but the big households had absolutely no abandonment concept, and if the price was low, there might be a move to increase the code, the daily transaction statistics were 4,710 bales, and the market 20 Shuangma was not much different from the previous day, and the amount purchased by each gang mouth is listed as left,</p>

<h3 id="e73">Chinese Constables of Various Police Stations in the French Concession Requested Improved Treatment Yesterday - Approximately 1,000 Chinese Constables Briefly Went on Strike - Service Resumed as Normal After Discussions - The French Consul-General Promised to Provide Satisfactory Answers to the 17 Items Requested <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Following the satisfactory resolution of the issue of Chinese constables in the Public Concession requesting improved treatment, all Chinese constables in the French Concession, due to meager income and difficulty in maintaining a living, also made a verbal request to the French authorities to increase the salaries of Chinese constables. 150 people from the Lukiawan Police Station were the first to go on strike at 8:25 AM yesterday. Other Chinese constables from police stations such as Songshan Road and Dazimingzhong, as well as the reserve team vehicle department, responded one after another upon hearing the news. 1,400 Chinese constables stopped working, causing the French Concession Police Commissioner Fabre and Deputy Commissioner Blanczy to immediately summon the Chinese constables from the Lukiawan Police Station for talks. Three representatives of the Chinese constables submitted the terms of the request. Fabre expressed his willingness to study them and promised to give a satisfactory answer within three or four days. The Chinese constables were satisfied and, considering the importance of public security, collectively returned to their posts at 10:00 AM, and traffic order was also restored. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>French Police Deployed to Maintain Traffic</p>
<p>After the Chinese constables went on strike at 8:00 AM yesterday, traffic on the roads of the French Concession was quite chaotic for a time due to the lack of personnel to direct it. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a large number of private cars traveled eastward on Avenue Joffre to offices and shops in the Bund area. This was a common phenomenon, but because most of the traffic lights on Avenue Joffre were unattended, the line of cars stretched for hundreds. At the same time, trams and rickshaws also moved in succession, which was very slow, and the noise was mixed, which was very close to Shanyin Road. Later, employees of the tram company and French patrols were dispatched to direct traffic at various intersections, and order was gradually restored. However, because there were not enough people, they seemed quite busy. Some silver shops and large stores on Avenue Joffre and Avenue Foch closed their doors after hearing that the Chinese constables were on strike to prevent unexpected events, while other stores were not affected.</p>
<p>French Defense Forces Join Patrols</p>
<p>After the Chinese constables went on strike, the French Concession authorities, fearing problems with public security, immediately ordered all French defense forces, French expatriate volunteer corps, and reserve patrols to mobilize immediately, deploy to important locations, and patrol Avenue Joffre, Avenue Foch, and other places in groups of five, searching pedestrians and vehicles. Annamese and White Russian patrols were assigned to perform the work left by the Chinese constables. French police chiefs rode motorcycles around the roads, and armored vehicles patrolled everywhere, which was very busy. However, because the number of French and Vietnamese police officers was small, their strength was still very weak. However, residents of the French Concession were especially careful, so no unexpected events were heard. The French and Vietnamese military police who were deployed were still patrolling after the resumption of work and were demobilized in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Authorities Guarantee a Satisfactory Answer</p>
<p>After the strike occurred, French Police Commissioner Fabre and Deputy Commissioner Blanczy convened the Chinese constables of the Lukiawan Police Station for talks at 8:45 AM. 120 Chinese constables attended. Fabre announced that the French Concession authorities were paying close attention to the lives of Chinese constables after the recent price increases and were considering ways to improve the situation. He hoped that the Chinese constables would submit their requests. The Chinese constables’ representatives 158, 164, and 598, immediately submitted the terms. Fabre said that he was willing to guarantee that he would give a satisfactory answer to these conditions within three or four days and hoped to return to their posts immediately to ensure public security. The Chinese constables were satisfied and immediately resumed their duties. In the early morning yesterday, a Chinese constable propagandist was arrested by White Russian detectives while propagating the strike on Route Ghisié de Viliers and Route Massenet, but was released before the resumption of work.</p>
<p>Seventeen Requests Made in Total</p>
<p>The seventeen requests made by all the Chinese constables are as follows: (1) Request the establishment of a French Concession Chinese Constables Mutual Aid Association; (2) Request to set up a Chinese Constable General Patrol office in the Central Police Station; (3) A minimum salary of 60 yuan, 5 dou of rice subsidy, a special allowance of 30 yuan, a housing allowance of 18 yuan, and double pay at the end of the year according to the official salary; (4) Savings funds remain the same, with an annual seniority wage increase of two yuan; (5) If a constable's gun is stolen, those who have been dismissed should not be required to pay for the gun; (6) The reserve class should prepare for 24 hours according to the old rules; (7) The uniform should be changed to Western style, and black leggings should be used in winter and summer; (8) Inspections of uniforms and drills should be held twice a year; (9) The detective department is short of personnel and should be selected by Chinese constables through examination; (10) Each person should be issued a Chinese constable certificate, and amusement parks, trams, and parks should be free of charge; (11) The chief room should not be prohibited from going out except on special Chinese commemorative days and French National Day; (12) During work hours, if there are day shifts, night shifts should be canceled, and evening shifts should be double-posted for joint patrols; (13) Chinese constables who are heavily fined or dismissed must have the signature of the Chinese Constable General Patrol; (14) Velvet blankets, underwear, and mats must be issued by the police station; (15) Establish a school for the children of Chinese constables; (16) Give one month of official leave each year, with salary paid as usual. If a patrol is punished, the holiday should not be deducted without authorization; (17) Chinese constables should not be pursued for paying "official business" on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Declaring Absolutely No Other Purpose</p>
<p>According to the Chinese constables, the strike yesterday was purely due to the inevitability of life. The salary of Chinese constables is only 24 and a half yuan per month, with another 5 dou of rice subsidy and a subsidy of 17 yuan, 1 dime and 5 cents, but the total is only 74 yuan. At a time of such drastic price increases, it is obviously impossible to maintain a family life. The grief should be understood and sympathized with by all citizens. The order for each Chinese constable to pry open 15 vehicle notices per month is particularly painful.</p>

<p>The Mainland News reported that yesterday (the 10th) at 5:00 PM, a Chinese farmer was suddenly stabbed in the buttocks by a Japanese soldier with a bayonet while walking across the Yichang Road Bridge. The wound was quite deep. Passersby called for a fire department ambulance and sent the farmer to the hospital. On the way, they were stopped by a Japanese sentry for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Municipal Council Police Officer Beaten - Formal Protest Lodged - To Be Delivered to the Japanese Side This Morning - Searches Continued in the Western District of Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council had not yet lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities regarding the case of a Chinese police officer of the Police Department being beaten by Japanese military police yesterday. According to a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council, the protest will likely be lodged with the Japanese side this morning by Chairman Silas Aaron Hardoon.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Meeting Decides to Negotiate</p>
<p>Regarding the infringement by Japanese merchant buses of the Shanghai Municipal Council's licensed traffic business rights in the extraterritorial area of ​​Western Shanghai, Council Chairman Silas Aaron Hardoon had already lodged a protest with Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Horinouchi Kensuke the day before yesterday, as reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to reporters from Da Zhong News Agency, when the Municipal Council Board held its regular meeting yesterday afternoon, the incident was reported. It was stated that after investigation by the Japanese Consulate, the Japanese Consul stated that the operation of Japanese merchant buses in Western Shanghai was a private matter and that the Japanese government was not aware of it. After discussion, the directors decided that in addition to the administrative authorities conducting negotiations based on reason, Japanese directors should also be entrusted to investigate the truth of the matter.</p>
<p>Rickshaw Licenses Still Awaiting Report</p>
<p>The English-language "The China Press" stated, "It is understood that regarding the recent case of a Chinese police officer of the Police Department being beaten and humiliated by Japanese military police, it is expected that Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Silas Aaron Hardoon will formally lodge a new protest with the authorities of the Japanese Consulate today (the 11th)." As for the "notice" recently issued in the Western District that rickshaws on extraterritorial roads will be forced to pay for "Municipal Council" licenses starting on Monday, the Municipal Council is awaiting a formal report from the Police Department this morning. A certain Chang of the Municipal Council stated that he could not comment on the latter issue until he received a report from the Police Department.</p>
<p>No Signs of Lifting the Blockade</p>
<p>The situation in the blocked area of ​​Western Shanghai remains calm today. Officials stated yesterday (the 10th) that they believed the restrictions would be lifted on Saturday and Sunday. However, there were no concrete signs of the restrictions being lifted in the area this morning. Japanese merchant buses continue to run on Yuyuan Road, and Japanese military police and conscripted police are still conducting strict searches in the area.</p>
<p>News Vendors Detained and Not Released</p>
<p>Rumors that the Japanese side prohibits newspapers from being delivered to the blocked area and opened near residents were denied by Japanese officials this morning. It is said that Chinese people carrying parcels are subject to searches, but newspapers are allowed to be sent into the blocked area. However, according to Chinese sources, several news vendors were detained at the Japanese Military Police Headquarters on Route Dufour yesterday for delivering newspapers to the blocked area, and have not yet been released today. At the same time, Shanghai Municipal Council Chairman Silas Aaron Hardoon protested to the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai yesterday regarding the operation of Japanese buses in the Western District, and is awaiting a reply today.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Youth Association Members and Families Gather to Sew Winter Clothing; Participating Men and Women Enthusiastically Collaborate, Hoping the Association Will Continue Fundraising to Achieve Full Success <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Association's fundraising for winter clothing to aid freezing, suffering children has been previously reported in this newspaper. We now learn that the Association has successively received hundreds of pieces of new and used clothing donated by warm-hearted individuals from all walks of life, as well as over eight thousand yuan in cash. They are proceeding to purchase cloth and cotton to begin sewing, and have explored continued fundraising and various related matters, as detailed below:</p>
<p>Volunteer Sewing</p>
<p>The Association meticulously considered and established detailed methods for sewing winter clothing in advance, emphasizing educational significance. On a recent day, the Association invited members' families to the meeting to volunteer sewing. Simultaneously, the China Underwear Company donated an electric cutter and two tailoring technicians, while the Singer Company lent six sewing machines. Electric cutting was immediately put into use, proving to be very efficient. Hundreds of pieces of clothing material were cut in a short time, with uniform sizes. In addition, tasks such as folding cloth, operating the sewing machines, spreading cotton, stitching, attaching straps, and printing were divided and collaborated on. Participating men and women were extremely enthusiastic. Each garment, besides the outer layer, contains one "shi jin" (approximately 1.1 pounds) of cotton, with labor and material costs totaling 3.50 national currency.</p>
<p>Continued Fundraising</p>
<p>The Association believes that the current collection of clothing, including those being sewn, amounts to only over two thousand pieces. The number of suffering children in Shanghai is vast, and with the imminent arrival of severe cold, the supply is insufficient. The Winter Clothing Committee of the Association decided to continue fundraising. The method involves printing a kind of three-yuan winter clothing receipt, distributed to Association members for endorsement. Subsequently, committee members will individually conduct fundraising. To encourage participation, the top five fundraisers will be awarded prizes to show recognition. Furthermore, to seek broad public donations, the Association has specially made over ten donation boxes for suffering children, planning to display them in prominent locations in major stores and cinemas before Christmas, requesting donations. There are many kind-hearted and charitable individuals in Shanghai, and it is hoped that substantial donations will be easily obtained.</p>
<p>Distribution Methods</p>
<p>The Association's committee, noting that in past years, winter clothing distributed by various charitable organizations in Shanghai during winter was often pawned by recipients or distributed unevenly, leading to numerous abuses. As a result, genuinely poor and suffering individuals could not receive practical benefits, while cunning individuals would fraudulently receive several pieces, reselling them repeatedly, wasting the sincere efforts of donors, which is very regrettable. The Association now plans to use scientific methods to conduct on-site investigations in impoverished areas, collecting statistics on the family circumstances of each suffering child. Those who are most impoverished and suffering will be selected for distribution. Each winter clothing item will be specially printed with the red characters "Winter clothing for warmth, not accepted for pawning," so that the funds are not wasted and the effort is truly effective.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Muslim Graves in Zhenru Excavated, Causing Outrage Among Believers <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Muslim representatives in this city stated to reporters yesterday that the Japanese "Central China Railway Company" is currently excavating Muslim graves in the Zhenru area. This matter has caused indignation among all Muslims in this city. It is reported that there were originally hundreds of Muslim graves in that area. After the Japanese excavated them, they merely erected a small tombstone on the original site, stating that it was once a burial ground for Shanghai Muslims. Recently, the Japanese authorities criticized the graves in the Zhenru area for hindering the development of railway branch lines. Therefore, disregarding appeals from Muslim groups around the world, they proceeded to excavate. Muslims had previously proposed changing the route to bypass the burial ground, but to no avail. The Muslims here do not intend to protest this matter, knowing it would be futile.</p>

<p>Passengers on foreign ships such as Moufu, Haifu, Feikang, and American Da Sheng, which were detained off the coast of Dinghai Toutougang Nianmudun, have successively transferred to ships returning to Shanghai. The shipowners have also separately negotiated with the Japanese army in Dinghai, but they all claimed that it must be decided by the Japanese army in Shanghai, so there has been no result. Now, some of the crew members, because they have been detained for a long time, a few have also taken ships to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e79">President Jackson Arrives in Shanghai This Morning on Round-the-World Voyage; No Tours Due to Unusual Circumstances <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The American Mail Steamship Company's newly completed President Jackson, on her maiden voyage from New York via Los Angeles, San Francisco, Honolulu, and various locations in Japan, is scheduled to arrive here this morning at 7:30, docking at buoys 14 and 15. Only sixteen passengers will disembark in Shanghai, while fifty-four will remain on board for the round-the-world voyage. Passengers arriving in Shanghai will transfer to small ferries and disembark at the New Customs Wharf at 9:00 a.m. The ship originally intended to offer tours to the public, but due to the unusual circumstances, the order was temporarily suspended by the head office. After staying here overnight, she is scheduled to set sail eastward tomorrow morning, passing through Hong Kong, various locations in Southeast Asia and India, rounding the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, crossing the Atlantic Ocean, and returning to New York. The last ferry will depart from the New Customs Wharf tomorrow morning at 1:00 a.m. (i.e., midnight tonight). In addition, the company's old round-the-world mail ship, President Van Buren, is also scheduled to arrive in port at noon today, scheduled to dock at buoys 12 and 13. It is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the same day as the new ship President Jackson. It is reported that this ship will transport a large batch of goods from the United States, amounting to 3,000 tons.</p>

<p>The French mail ship, the D'Artagnan, arrived from Saigon via Manila yesterday morning at 10:00, docking at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. Passengers and luggage were transported to the New Customs Wharf by ferry at 11:30. Among the passengers were thirteen members of the Vietnamese mission to Japan economic delegation. In addition to seventy-four passengers, the ship also carried a large quantity of mail, goods, and over 71,500 bags of Vietnamese rice, ordered from Saigon by the relevant parties in this city. It is expected that the inflationary trend in rice prices in this city will be slightly abated as a result. The ship will set sail eastward to Kobe, Japan, on Sunday as soon as the unloading is completed.</p>
<p>No Difficulties Expected in Transporting Vietnamese Rice to Shanghai</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily Mail" reported that rice prices in this city fell today (November 11), and the selling price of some types of rice was even lower than the officially set price limit. According to rice merchants, the drop in rice prices was due to the 70,000 bags of Vietnamese rice brought from Vietnam by the French ship D'Artagnan today. It is generally believed that Vietnam will not impose any difficulties in transporting rice to Shanghai. Furthermore, according to French Consul-General Maziere, he has requested official details from the Vietnamese side regarding the rumors of Vietnam prohibiting the export of tribute rice, and has not yet received a reply. However, he intends to discuss the matter in detail with the Vietnamese trade mission to Japan passing through Shanghai today, so that he can learn what regulations Vietnam will implement regarding the transport of tribute rice to Shanghai.</p>
<p>French Consul-General Says Rice Reserves Sufficient</p>
<p>Maziere also stated that he has studied the statistics and learned that in recent weeks, a large amount of food rice has been transported to Shanghai from the south. He hopes that the rumors that Vietnam will issue an order prohibiting the export of rice are not entirely accurate. He feels that Shanghai's current rice reserves are sufficient for the current needs, and there is no fear of a rice shortage for the time being. Furthermore, according to a spokesman for the Public Works Department, public concession police officers continued to investigate rice merchant operations this morning and did not find any evidence of price gouging. Any rice merchants accused of price gouging will be punished if there is factual evidence.</p>
<p>Opinions of the Rice Grain Trade Association on Transactions</p>
<p>On the 9th of this month, the concession authorities invited representatives of the rice industry to discuss methods to stabilize the people's food supply. The principle of public warehouse grain storage has been adopted and a subcommittee will be established to discuss the details and implement them. It was also decided that starting from the 12th of this month, all rice grains traded in the market must first pay a deposit of five yuan per bag, with a deadline of five days for delivery of the goods, paying the full price. The Bean Rice Industry and Coarse Grain Oilcake Industry Associations held a meeting yesterday to discuss this. All committee members present stood up to express their opinions, and the discussion was lively. Then they began to discuss (1) the case of implementing the method of requiring a deposit and a deadline for the delivery of rice grains. It was decided that the above-mentioned deposit amount and payment date would be followed in all cases. As for the delivery date, according to the resolution of the joint meeting of the two associations on May 8 of this year, payment must be made within five days from the date of the transaction, with 80% for goods with a bill of lading and 50% for goods without a bill of lading, and weighing and delivery must be completed within ten days. Once a rice grain transaction is completed, it is valid. If the buyer cannot deliver the goods on time, the seller should enforce it and sell it as usual on the eleventh day. If there is a profit, it will be settled and returned to the buyer, and if there is a loss, the deposit will be used to offset it. There will be no further settlement, and it will be enforced by the Market Management Committee.</p>

(3) Regarding the case of continuing to raise donations for price stabilization and winter relief, it was decided to set a donation target of 50,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e82">Xinda Xiang Appeals to Tenants, Still Wants to Increase Rent by 80%; High Court Second Branch Observed Both Parties Reaching a Settlement Yesterday <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Xinda Xiang silk and cloth shop at 614 Nanjing Road leases the property from Dehe Foreign Firm for a monthly rent of 1,900 yuan, with monthly expenses, including property taxes, totaling over 2,200 yuan. The shop was originally the site of the former Dahu Bank. There were several offices on the second and third floors for subletting. The place was originally named Dahu Building, later renamed Xinda Xiang Building. In addition to using the entire storefront, the shop occupies nine-tenths of the second floor and two-tenths of the third floor, with the remaining parts sublet to twenty tenants, collecting monthly rent of over 700 yuan. The shop signed leases with the tenants, acting as the landlord, and the leases were all indefinite. However, the shop's lease with Dehe Foreign Firm was a fixed-term lease, expiring on May 16 of this year. Dehe Foreign Firm, due to the shop's particularly prosperous business, notified the shop that starting from May of this year, the rent would be increased by 80%, otherwise the shop must move out. The shop accepted Dehe Foreign Firm's request and at the same time notified all subtenants that the rent would also be increased by 80%. The tenants unanimously opposed this. Subsequently, the shop hired lawyer Wang Zhengshao to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special Court, requesting that the tenants Jinling Typing School, Mu Qing, Meiduo Radio Company, Wang Runtao, Jinjihao Zhou Yinong, etc., pay an 80% rent increase starting from July of this year. Wang Runtao and others immediately hired lawyer Wei Weiqing to defend, stating that the plaintiff, Xinda Xiang silk and cloth shop, is next door to Taichang Ginseng Shop. Dehe Foreign Firm only increased Taichang Ginseng Shop's rent by 10%, while Xinda Xiang's rent was increased by 80%, and Xinda Xiang never voiced any opposition. However, Taichang Ginseng Shop's store area is 750 square feet, with a monthly rent of 627 yuan, which is 8 jiao 3 fen 6 li per square foot. Xinda Xiang's area is 5,250 square feet, so if compared to Taichang Ginseng Shop, the shop's entire storefront would have to pay 4,389 yuan per month, which is more than enough to cover Xinda Xiang's current monthly expenses of only 4,250 yuan. Moreover, nine-tenths of the second floor and two-tenths of the third floor are also used by Xinda Xiang itself. The tenants pay more than 700 yuan in rent per month, which is pure profit for Xinda Xiang. The shop is still not satisfied, and it is unknown what the motive is, and they are trying to increase the rent by 80%, and it is even more unknown what the motive is. After Judge Ni reviewed the case, he ruled that the subtenants' rent should be increased by 10% (following the example of Dehe Foreign Firm increasing Taichang Ginseng Shop's rent). Xinda Xiang silk and cloth shop was dissatisfied with the judgment and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to appeal, hoping to achieve the goal of an 80% rent increase. The tenants Wang Runtao and others entrusted lawyer Wei Weiqing to act as their agent in the defense, requesting that the original judgment be upheld. After Judge Han of the High Court Second Branch heard the case yesterday, he instructed that the date be changed and advised both parties to go outside and reach a settlement.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Great China Factory Labor Dispute, Intensified Mediation <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Police Department Convened Negotiations Yesterday; Yu Qiaqing Agreed to Serve as Mediator</p>
<p>The labor dispute at the Great China Rubber Factory on Xujiahui Road, which began on the 3rd, has not yet been resolved. The management seems to have completely handed over the responsibility of protecting the factory to the labor side. Therefore, the workers now bear a heavier burden than production work, making their duties more difficult. According to a reporter from the Shewen News Agency, the French Concession authorities, because the labor dispute has been prolonged, causing harm to both labor and management, summoned negotiations again yesterday morning by the head of the Political Affairs Department of the French Police Department, Malai. The labor side requested a 10% wage increase, and the management agreed to half a percent, and negotiations must be held after work is resumed first, resulting in no resolution. It is heard that Mr. Yu Qiaqing has agreed to serve as a mediator in the labor dispute at the factory, and has scheduled a meeting with representatives from both sides this afternoon. It will not be difficult to resolve the labor dispute at the factory.</p>

Then, discussion began on (1) the fundraising methods and incentive principles. It was decided that the incentive methods would be approved in principle, with rewards divided into seven levels: 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 yuan. (2) Adding Standing Committee members. It was decided to add Wang Miaoda, Zhu Yaochen, Xie Junshou, Pan Zhigao, Zhou Jiasheng, and Yan Chengde. (3) To facilitate widespread donation collection, in addition to the original eight designated institutions, all banks, money shops, or silver shops managed by compatriots are requested to collect donations. The resolution was passed.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Pledges</p>
<p>The pledges were quite enthusiastic. As of now, more than 100,000 yuan has been pledged, and over 90,000 yuan has been collected. The following is a record of some of those who pledged donations: Pei Yunqing 10,000 yuan, Lu Jilin 5,000 yuan, Huang Yuzhai 5,000 yuan, Tian Tongchun 5,000 yuan, Zhu Dianrong 5,000 yuan, Yuan Ludeng 5,000 yuan, Yan Dayou 5,000 yuan, Pei Zhenyong 5,000 yuan, Liu Zhifang 5,000 yuan, Zhou Jiasheng 5,000 yuan.

This will not only be a blessing for the Shaoxing people residing in Shanghai, but also a fortune for the entire city.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Two Kidnappings Occurred in the Two Concessions Yesterday Morning, One on Qiqi Road and One on Haifang Road, Kidnappers Used Automobiles, Already Found <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Two kidnapping cases occurred successively yesterday morning in the French Concession and the Public Concession. One was the son of the deputy director of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee, Jin Youqin, and the other was the small factory owner of the Xin Ya Iron Factory, Cai Guoliang. The details obtained are recorded below.</p>
<p>Schoolboy Kidnapped at Entrance to Lane</p>
<p>At around 8:00 yesterday morning, at the entrance of Lane 195, Qiqi Road, French Concession, four kidnappers suddenly kidnapped an eight-year-old schoolboy who had just come out of the lane, took his bicycle, and put him in a white-plated automobile with the license plate number 12129, which was parked at the entrance of the lane, and sped away. At that time, there were few pedestrians in the area, and it was in a remote location, so only one rickshaw puller witnessed it. Then, a servant from No. 6 in the lane came out and saw a bicycle left at the entrance of the lane, which belonged to his young master. He hurried back to inform his master, Quan Shaowu, who reported it to the French Concession Police Station, which sent investigators to investigate. It was learned that there were a total of four kidnappers, two of whom were carrying handguns. The car they were riding in was a dispatch car from the Albert Road branch of the Taire Company on Myers Road. One kidnapper had rented the car beforehand, but after driving it to a remote location in western Shanghai, he drove the driver, Gao Gengsheng, away and then went to kidnap. The car was found at around 9:00 a.m. within the jurisdiction of the Jing'an Temple Police Station. According to reports, Quan is from Beiping and is the deputy director of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee. The French Concession Police Station is now fully investigating the case.</p>
<p>Factory Owner Kidnapped on the Way to the Factory</p>
<p>The owner of the Xin Ya Iron Factory at No. 182, Lane 430, Haifang Road, Public Concession, is Cai Genxing from Wuxian. The factory's accountant is Cai's son, Guoliang (22 years old). Cai and his wife and children live at No. 11, Kangle Lane, Kanglote Road. Usually, he has a reserved charter car for transportation. At 8:30 yesterday morning, Cai's son, Guoliang, took the car to the factory to work. Unexpectedly, when the car passed the intersection of Jinghua Road, three kidnappers suddenly appeared, took out guns, and kidnapped Cai into a car on the side of the road, and sped away at full speed. The chauffeur, A, watched the kidnapper's car leave and hurried home to report the incident. After Cai reported it to the police, because the chauffeur was terrified when threatened by the kidnappers, he did not see the license plate number of the kidnapper's car clearly. It was also heard that before Cai was kidnapped, his father had repeatedly received threatening letters from gangsters.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Sketches of the British Women's Association Christmas Charity Bazaar (Part 1) <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>"Mammy, don't get lost!" A foreign girl's delicate voice broke through the subtle, mixed laughter and reached her mother's ears.</p>
<p>Everyone was so crowded they could barely breathe. After finally managing to reach out and buy a ticket for one yuan, they leaned against the handrail of the escalator, which was adorned with green pines and cypresses. Without much effort, they were carried up the stairs, step by step, by the people behind them. Looking down, several pots of three- or four-foot-tall "ivory red" plants were placed at the entrance, looking particularly vibrant and lush under the warm "atmosphere." The ticket booth was piled high with banknotes, accumulating more and more... When they looked up, they were already at the entrance to the "Green Room" on the second floor of the Racecourse, inside which was the charity bazaar organized by the British Women's Association of this city yesterday to raise funds to support their home country's war efforts.</p>
<p>Lady Kerr, the wife of the British Ambassador, had just finished her speech, and everyone applauded, expressing their warm welcome. She stood on the stage with a gentle, spring-like smile. Slender and gracefully dressed in a dark-colored outfit, she looked even more dignified and elegant. A fashionable, brimmed hat accentuated her full but not plump, oval-shaped face, making her look particularly lively and charming. The strong electric light from the magnesium flashbulbs focused on her from all directions, one after another, until she stepped down from the stage. At this time, it was just after three o'clock, and the charity bazaar officially opened.</p>
<p>"Try your luck!"... "Anything else?"... "How lovely it is!" These were the sounds that filled the ears. If I continued to write, I could compile a chapter of English conversation! The room was filled with various foods, daily necessities, and decorative items for the charity bazaar... Crowded with many foreign wives and children. The main hall, located on the grandstand of the Racecourse, was so packed that not even water could seep through. It took a great deal of effort to be able to roll through this "sea of people" in a circle, feeling as if you were being swept along involuntarily.</p>
<p>As soon as you entered, from left to right, along the corner of the wall was a candy stall, followed by a "used goods stall," a book stall, and a counter selling Christmas gifts. Directly opposite the entrance was the "lucky dip," divided into sections for boys and girls. In the center of the hall was a large Christmas tree, adorned with tassels, pendants, ribbons, and silver tinsel, making it very beautiful, with many toys placed around it. Beyond the Christmas tree was an area selling small items made of shells, priced from two dimes to several yuan, which was quite cheap. Near the exit door was a display area for auction items, with many items donated by various businesses in Shanghai, such as Victor records, Lao Jie Fu silks and satins, as well as private donations of fountain pens, tea sets, Chinese paintings, cigars, and whiskey, in a wide variety of styles.</p>
<p>Along the row of stalls along the grandstand windows on the east side were gardening items, women's cosmetics, Tombola (a type of lottery shopping), guessing contests, and a toy counter. The corner selling gardening and homemade goods was decorated with scenery to resemble a house, cut in half, showing great ingenuity. When the opening ceremony was held, Lady Kerr, the wife of the Ambassador, stood in front of this house scenery to deliver her speech. In the lucky draw, thin strips of colored paper were rolled up, each costing one yuan to buy. If you unwrapped it and found a number, you could claim a prize corresponding to that number. The ladies were very enthusiastic in their purchases. The guessing contests cost five dimes or one yuan. You had to guess the number or weight of a basket of shelled nuts or a smoked ham. One old lady wearing glasses, who looked very clever, ran over and lifted the ham with both hands, saying, "Twelve pounds." So, the female employee wrote down her name and address, so that she could be notified at dawn if the ham was indeed twelve pounds. The guessing contests for valuable items had ticket prices as high as five yuan.</p>
<p>Because there were too many people inside, it was not only inconvenient to buy things but also difficult to even look at them. A wife carrying a girl said to her companion, "I brought a check for one hundred yuan and would like to buy a lot of things, but it's too crowded to even get close." Her words expressed a sense of regret. Her companion also complained about the disorganized management of the venue. Mr. Crazors, an accountant, had set up a temporary bank on the second floor, where anyone with checks or needing to make exchanges could go to handle their business.</p>
<p>Finally squeezing out of the north-facing door, walking past the ice cream stand, they turned into the game room, which had games such as fishing, mini golf, using chopsticks to pick up glass balls, travel contests, map pinning, and beanbag toss.</p>

<p>Confiscated Box Cannon and Bullets; Passerby Injured by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>At 7:30 PM last night, detectives Wu Qiming and two others, numbers 383 and 404, from the French Concession police, were walking along the intersection of Route de Macao and Rue Wagner when they noticed four individuals ahead acting suspiciously. They immediately ordered them to stop, intending to search them. Unexpectedly, the four individuals fled eastward, drawing handguns and opening fire to resist arrest. The detectives also drew their guns and returned fire. Both sides exchanged fire for over ten shots, bullets flying everywhere, and pedestrians fled in panic. At that time, two men and two women were injured by stray bullets. The detectives chased the bandits to the intersection of Rue Mityenne and Rue Wagner, arresting Wang Aqiang (32 years old, from Anhui) and Wang Jinbiao (22 years old, from Nanjing). A box cannon and six bullets were found on Wang Jinbiao. The other two bandits escaped without a trace. The two captured bandits, along with the box cannon and bullets, were taken to the police station for interrogation. Simultaneously, an ambulance was called to take the injured pedestrians, Zhang Dejian (20 years old, local, resident of Lane 109, No. 9 Rue Lafayette) with a left foot injury, Wang Arong (18 years old) with a right eye injury, Shen Chen (18 years old, from Zhenjiang, resident of Lane Yinyu, No. 26 Rue Groc) with a left arm injury, and Mao Amei (26 years old, from Guangdong, resident of Pudong) with a left shoulder injury, all four to Guangci Hospital. Fortunately, their injuries were not serious. After being bandaged by the doctors, they were discharged from the hospital. Additionally, Detective No. 383's left shoe was hit by a bullet but his skin was not injured.</p>

<p>Ticket Seller Hides, Driver Injured</p>
<p>At 9:15 PM last night, a Route 7 public bus was driving along Route Haig near Yidingpan Road when it was stopping. Suddenly, several hooligans began throwing stones into the bus, leading to a conflict with the ticket seller. The hooligans completely shattered the bus's glass windows. Seeing that they were outnumbered, the ticket seller fled into the crowd to take cover. Unexpectedly, the hooligans turned their anger towards the driver, Yi Mingyi (37 years old, from Anhui, resident of No. 5, Lane Shengde, Route Brenan), of bus number 374, dragging him out and striking his head several times with iron bars. Yi was injured, fell to the ground, and lost consciousness. The hooligans then dispersed in a chaotic rush. The police sent him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>— Mu He</p>
<p>"I became a widow overnight. It's really something I never expected..." she said, seemingly lost.</p>
<p>Looking at her lost face and the child she held in her arms, wearing a white cloth hat with a white ball on top, I also felt a little lost. I couldn't say a word of comfort, and didn't seem to want to say anything. Yes, what's the use of mere sympathy for widows and orphans, except for practical help?</p>
<p>"I really don't know how to thank you, truly... You don't know how sad I am. Since he died, besides you visiting me, only a strange old woman saw me and the child wearing mourning clothes and said a sympathetic word: 'So young, such a small child, and already without a man, widowed, it's really pitiful.'" she said, her eyes shining with gratitude towards me.</p>
<p>I was surprised, I was amazed: Such a small act of sympathy could evoke such sincere emotion from her?</p>
<p>"You're surprised, aren't you?" she seemed to understand what I meant. "It's simple, what's so strange? I've become a widow, and everyone looks down on me, even dislikes me; and even the child is no exception. That day I personally heard the landlady say to someone: 'It's this child's bad luck, with an unlucky horoscope. Ever since that child was born, either the husband was sick or she was bedridden, medicine pots never left the door.'" She looked at the child sleeping quietly in her arms.</p>
<p>The child is innocent, I thought.</p>
<p>"On the day of the coffin, I was really sad, but I couldn't cry. They insisted that I cry; and the child? They said this was his last time seeing his father, that he had to cry a farewell, so they hit the child, hit his face, twisted his arms, and the child cried loudly. I was really sad when I saw it then, and now I regret why I didn't stop them then..." She looked at the child again, holding him tightly.</p>
<p>The child is innocent, I thought.</p>
<p>"Because I didn't cry 'properly,' because my crying wasn't loud enough and I didn't wail while crying, they all said I was too impolite, resented me, hated me, and looked down on me." she continued, "When I went back carrying the child, the landlady held a burning grass stalk from afar to greet me, telling me to carry the child and step over the fire, saying it was to 'burn' away the 'bad luck,' ah, I really couldn't take it, ah..." she cried.</p>
<p>The child is innocent, and she is innocent, I thought again.</p>
<p>"I can't think about how to live in the future – I dare not think. The hostility of others right now is already scaring me to death..." she sobbed.</p>
<p>On the way back, I seemed to see many hostile faces waving before my eyes. I understood that humanity is unwilling to easily give even cheap sympathy, and only 'bestows' it after carefully assessing the recipient. I clenched my fist angrily, letting the cold wind blow on my face, and I gazed at this ruthless society.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Wife's Appeal <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>This is an appeal from a pitiful wife. Please show me a path!</p>
<p>We are partners united by love. For three years, our small family life has been quite happy. We each have stable jobs and a considerable income, enough to support a family of above-average means. We have no vices, no worries, both parents are alive, and our siblings are well. Except for lacking a child, I can't think of anything else we need.</p>
<p>I don't know how it happened, but misfortune suddenly descended upon our heads: This spring, stock prices soared. Several of my husband's colleagues, who were keen on wealth and status, were frantically making phone calls outside every day. All he heard was how Old Wang had made a thousand in profits and how Ah Zhang had made eight hundred from the Yangtze. Over time, he also became eager and scraped together some capital to join the speculative business. At first, things went smoothly, and he earned a thousand or two, so he was reluctant to stop. Finally, one day, stock prices plummeted, like a mountain torrent bursting its banks! His capital and profits were all poured into this terrible pit!</p>
<p>In this desperate situation, he still couldn't accept it and kept dreaming of recouping his losses every day. He even took leave from the office to go to some silver house to watch the market. But what's the use? It's like a soldier stuck in the mud, sinking deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>Look at our life now! The house is mortgaged, the furniture is sold, the savings are pawned, and even my precious jewelry and personal savings have been completely emptied. We still owe tens of thousands in debt!</p>
<p>I have repeatedly advised him to quit and said that by enduring a few years of hardship, we can repay the debt. But surrounded and tempted by a group of bad friends, he is already dazed. How can my words have any effect! A few days ago, I saw him writing in the air again, without any appetite for food, and realized that he had secretly lost several hundred yuan again!</p>
<p>Sir: He has stumbled. What should I do? If this continues, our future will be unimaginable! Empty words cannot strengthen his will, and quarreling only increases anger. Please give me a more effective method! A person's downfall not only affects the happiness of his family but is also a great loss to the country and society!</p>
<p>A desperately worried woman respectfully writes.</p>
<p>To the Young and Wise Lady:</p>
<p>It is truly regrettable that a husband's stumble in speculative business has brought so much unrest to a family. In this unfortunate situation, it is a good opportunity for a virtuous wife to show her abilities. You are right, quarreling is harmful and useless, and gentle persuasion should continue whenever good opportunities arise. In addition to these two points, you should express sympathy for your husband's misfortune, but you should still insist on opposing his actions. Although the family's situation is not as good as before, you should maintain an optimistic and calm attitude and manage the household affairs well so that your husband does not feel disgusted with the family.</p>
<p>Your husband is currently influenced by his colleagues, so he sees your words as blowing in the wind. But you must not be discouraged because of this. His confused brain will one day clear up. We feel that there is one thing you can try in this regard. In addition to constantly advising your husband, you can also try to approach his colleagues and persuade them to jump out of the deep pit of speculation. If possible, it is best to unite the wives of these colleagues and act together so that they can realize the truth as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Your views on speculative business are correct. We believe that you are a rare, ambitious, and virtuous wife. We believe that with your perseverance and hard work, your family can return to the right path. We wish you success soon. Editor</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Shi Da pointed his hand out the window with all ten fingers and said: "Jingyuan is just ahead. Since you're going to tour the garden, please feel free. I'm immensely grateful for the fine wine and delicacies you've bestowed upon me, so allow me to drink a few more cups. If you want to drink with a beggar, I'm ashamed and undeserving, and also very uneasy." Zhang Tianru, hearing Shi Da speak so frankly, then said: "Very well. We have at least a dozen catties of wine on board, and we all have a low tolerance. Please, strong man Shi, drink as much as you like." Shi Da said: "Thank you for your hospitality. If you want to tour Jingyuan, please go ahead." Jiang Zi was initially afraid of the big man, but now was delighted by his forthrightness mixed with charm, only smiling foolishly at him. So Zhang Tianru left the great man Shi Da in the cabin to drink, while he himself took the Liu sisters ashore to Jingyuan. Jingyuan is a famous garden near the Chuihong Pavilion. Although small, its structure is very winding and magnificent. It is the place where the poet Ni Nanyun lived in seclusion. Zhang Tianru and Ni Nanyun were also literary friends, often exchanging poems and wine, so this time he took the Liu sisters to visit him and tour Jingyuan. The Liu sisters were originally from Songling. They were orphans from a young age, and their circumstances were pitiful. They became adopted daughters of Xu Danniang. Xu Danniang was also a famous courtesan in Shengze Town when she was young. Later, as she got older and her body grew fatter, she could no longer entertain guests herself, so she took the Liu sisters as adopted daughters and treated them as her own. The elder one was named Yang Ai, styled Yinglin, and the younger one was named Jiang Zi. As for the beautiful names of Ru Shi, they were given by Zhang Tianru. Ru Shi and Jiang Zi were a pair of flower sisters. Although they were beautiful and had a thin fate, they were helpless and dependent, they were both born with celestial beauty and a talented heart. Xu Danniang hired famous teachers to teach them reading and writing, and Liu Ru Shi's large and small calligraphy was truly well-written and delicate, and her singing voice was clear and crisp, like a good bird on a branch, so she was famous in Jiangnan. The Guijia Courtyard where they lived was bustling with carriages and horses, and the door was like a market. Xu Danniang had this pair of cash cows, so how could she not be happy? But Ru Shi's temperament was lonely and self-admiring, very proud, always self-possessed, and rarely allowed access. Those who came to visit were all refined people, and everyone knew her temperament, so they dared not treat her lightly. This was also because Ru Shi's talent and appearance were enough to overwhelm the group of beauties, so people naturally willingly gave her a bit of space. And her younger sister Jiang Zi was as intelligent and outstanding as her sister, so those who saw them could not help but praise them. Zhang Tianru, a famous scholar of the Fushe Society, retired to his home and, upon seeing Ru Shi, praised her as a celestial being and came to her boudoir every day to teach them poetry and lyrics. He was delighted that the two of them learned one thing and knew three, heard one thing and knew two, were very intelligent, and made rapid progress. Over the past year or two, Ru Shi's poetry has greatly improved, and her memory is particularly strong, never forgetting what she has seen, so she is also very knowledgeable about the classics. She is also able to deeply understand the meaning of reading and gains insights. Zhang Tianru, in his later years, gained this pair of female disciples, who could be trusted to carry on his legacy, and his heart was content. Seeing Ru Shi, such a beautiful woman, could not help but be moved. The so-called affection is like us. In his heart, he very much wanted to take Liu Ru Shi as a concubine, but he was not someone with a large salary, and could not take out ten bushels of pearls to hire her, and build a golden house to hide A Jiao, so he could only teach books in her boudoir every day. Being with this extremely intelligent female disciple, her beauty could cure hunger. This was also a kind of infatuation for Zhang Tianru. In fact, since Liu Ru Shi prided herself on her talent and beauty, she would never be willing to marry an old scholar in a remote village when choosing someone to serve. In her mind, there was naturally someone else. (7)</p>

<p>— Xing Gu</p>
<p>Tang Jie, this Mr. Wang who makes people laugh on the screen, has a history of serving in the film circle that cannot be considered short. At first, he was an actor in the Star Film Company. Later, Ye Qianyu's Mr. Wang comic strip became very popular. With a flash of inspiration, Tang Jie appeared on the screen imitating Mr. Wang. At that time, he was in Tianyi Film Company. Unexpectedly, the "Mr. Wang" film was very popular with the audience. In this way, Tang Jie became "Mr. Wang" for a long time.</p>
<p>After the war broke out, Tang Jie once organized a "Mr. Wang's Troupe" and performed in various parts of the mainland, which was well-received by all parties. Later, it merged with the "Movie Star Troupe." Last year, the "Movie Star Troupe" disbanded, and Tang Jie returned to Shanghai and joined Xinhua Film Company to continue making Mr. Wang films. Now, after the completion of "Mr. Wang's Night Visit to the Funeral Home," Tang Jie has asked the KMT authorities for leave for a period of time to revive his "Mr. Wang's Troupe" and seek further development.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter met Tang Jie. During the conversation, it was learned that the performance of "Mr. Wang's Troupe" has made great progress. Because the mainland cannot be visited at present, it has been decided to perform in Shanghai first. The date is from the 18th to the 24th of this month, a total of one week. The location has been tentatively set at the Xuan Palace Theater.</p>
<p>For some reasons, the performance name will not be "Mr. Wang's Troupe" but will be changed to "Unnamed Troupe." The troupe members are all from the original cast of "Mr. Wang's Troupe." The name of the performance is "Mr. Wang Exposes the Western Mirror." As the name suggests, it is another comedy.</p>

<p>Yi Hua Film Company New Director Chen Huanwen, since his *Three Smiles* was released, has been highly valued by Yi Hua Film Company. Therefore, his second film was given an even greater opportunity. Chen Huanwen himself has selected and adapted a section of *Romance of the Flowers in the Mirror* about the Kingdom of Women, and named it "Kingdom of Women." This script has been reviewed by production director Yan Youxiang and was put into production last Wednesday.</p>
<p>The actors in "Kingdom of Women" have almost mobilized all the new and old actors of Yi Hua Film Company, especially the newcomers, all of whom have participated in the work of "Kingdom of Women." The role of the Queen of Women has been taken by newcomer Miss Di Ping. Miss Di Ping comes from Singapore, but her Mandarin is extremely fluent. Yi Hua Film Company has great hopes for her. She was once appointed as the lead actress in the new film "Qianli Song Jingniang," but later it was changed to star in "Kingdom of Women" due to the needs of the film.</p>
<p>The more important roles include Yan Hua's Zhi Zhiyang, Zheng Zhong's Tang Ao, and Tan Guangyou's Duo Jiugong.</p>

<p>— Tang</p>
<p>(Eleven) Xu Xuelou</p>
<p>In the storytelling world, everyone knows that there is a well-known Xu Sandang. The early Xu Sandang was led by Xu Xuesheng, with Xuesheng's sister Xueren and female disciple Xueyue as assistants, famous for singing "Three Smiles" and "Painting the Golden Phoenix." At this time last year, Xueren married in Suzhou, and Xueyue also left Xu Xuesheng after completing her apprenticeship and started her own show (recently, Xueyue has been performing in Wujin and will be going to Wujiang soon). Therefore, Xu Xuelou and Xu Xuehua were replaced to fill the vacancies left by Xueyue and Xueren. Xuesheng plays the sanxian, Xuelou plays the yueqin, and Xuehua plays the pipa. This has become the current Xu Sandang. Every night, they sing and play at the Nanjing storytelling venue, receiving the welcome of storytelling fans.</p>
<p>What will be introduced here is the rising star of Xu Sandang - Miss Xu Xuelou.</p>
<p>Xuelou's original surname is Tang. Jiaxing, which has scenic spots such as the Misty Rain Tower on Mandarin Duck Lake, is her hometown. Unfortunately, she lost both of her parents at a young age. She was adopted into the Wu family in Lili, so she also took the surname Wu and was named Yuexian. When Wu Yunquan, who was good at telling "Twin Phoenix Pearls," was performing in Lili, she became Wu Yunquan's apprentice in a simple ceremony because of her interest, and learned to sing "Twin Phoenix Pearls." She was intelligent and usually studied diligently, so she made rapid progress. At the age of fifteen, she "debuted" and started her own show. Before the war, she sang and played in Suzhou. Although this little girl had not "debuted" for long, she was born with a face that was suitable for both anger and joy. A smile would reveal two dimples, and her singing was very clear, so she had a bit of the magic of summoning people. During that time, she once paired up with Hua Yusheng, Xu Xuesheng's senior brother. Later, she collaborated with Xu Xuesheng, which was introduced by Hua Yusheng. In name, she is Xu Xuesheng's adopted daughter and female disciple. Her change of name to Xu Xuelou also started from this.</p>
<p>Xuelou has been "debuted" until now for three years. That is to say: she is already eighteen years old this year! She also understands a little bit of writing, and newspapers and magazines are her amateur pastime. What she is good at is acting as the "primary player," speaking, cracking jokes, playing, and singing, completely imitating Xu Xueyue. Therefore, some people who used to worship Xu Xueyue are now fascinated by this successor of Xu Xueyue - Xu Xuelou.</p>
<p>The Xu Sandang used to only sing "Three Smiles" and "Painting the Golden Phoenix." Since Xuelou joined the Xu Sandang, Xuesheng also got a "Twin Phoenix Pearls" script from Xuelou's hand. Therefore, the old listeners of Xu Sandang all say: "Xuelou is Xu Xuesheng's female disciple, and at the same time, she can be said to be Xuesheng's teacher!"</p>
