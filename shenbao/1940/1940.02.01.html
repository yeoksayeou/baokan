<h3>天津日軍　阻食物運入租界　物價高漲甚於去年大水時祇有白俄能携食物入租界</h3>
<p>天津　據日本軍事發言人今日稱、日方對於食物之運入租界、並未加以何種限制但日方此種宣稱、完全與事實不符、此間英文華北明星報記者美人包溫、今日携帶鸚蛋六打、企圖通過日方哨兵綫、但結果爲日本哨兵所阻、包溫雖將美國之護照與日方所發之通行證出示、亦無效果、包溫以日兵欲其將鸚蛋留下、始得放行、故表示顯意略出罰款、至於鷄蛋則仍望保留、但日本哨兵依然不允所請、因是包溫唯有將所有六打鷄蛋全部放棄矣、此外另有外國新聞記者、因携有蘋果五隻、亦竟爲日哨兵所阻、不令進入英法租界、唯此二外國新聞記者、並非直欲携帶食物至租界、其意無非在測騐日本軍事發言人所稱日方不圖限止食物運入租界之說、是否眞相耳、至此可謂業已證實、又日方限制食物進入租界、祗須一觀租界中之食物價格、卽能了然、食物之在二星期前僅售三角五分一磅者、現已漲至一元一角一磅矣、同時在一星期前則僅售六角、按在二位新聞記者作此試騐之前、日本軍事發言人在招待新聞記者席上、曾堅持日方絕無餓斃租界之意思、記者當謂該發言人之所言、並非眞相、日本哨兵確實不許食物携入租界時、該發言人卽謂此項哨兵、皆係廣田隊、固直接聽命於本間司令者、決無誤會之處唯隨機處置之權、則各哨兵皆有之、又謂日方對於美僑之態度、與對於英僑以及其他各國之僑民態度業已完全相同、（按去年天津租界開始封鎖時、美人皆享特別待遇、今日方所言如是、顯已改變其對美之態度矣）、又謂日本所以希望第三國合作樹立「東亞新秩序」者、卽希望第三國對於日本採取友好之態度、不取敵視之態度也、又在席間、該發言人又稱、若欲求其方便、則無過於取銷租界、蓋至其時、卽無所用其障礙也、又日方對於租界之封鎖、實已加緊不少、在障礙物外等候通入租界中之卡車、不計其數然許其進入租界中者、不過極少數、其中有許多卡車、候於障礙物外至五日之久猶不得通過、因此租界中物價之高、竟較去年大水時爲尤甚、現時能往日方控制區域中携取食物者、僅有反共組織中之白俄、至於英美人士、深恐受日本哨兵之侮辱、皆不願作此嘗試、（三十日合衆社特派員吉爾卜電）</p>
<p>天津　據今日此間消息、英文「華北明星報」記者美人包溫氏、昨日在日方哨兵站處之遭遇、及其不許携帶鸚蛋六打至英租界之事件、已由其本人報吿美國駐津總領事高特威、又美人伊文司、於星期一由上海抵此、在日方哨兵站處、亦遭多方之刁難、因此伊文司亦將其經過情形、報吿美領事、聞美領事已將二人之遭遇、開列於其對華府之例常公事報吿中、同時此間之美僑商會、亦於今晚開會、討論日方加緊封鎖租界、及租界中食物缺乏之問題、並認爲情勢嚴重、按伊文司爲一著名律師、在中國頗具名望、據其對美合衆社記者言、渠於星期一日下午、由上海抵此、卽雇一汽車、向萬國橋前進、在此汽車中、並有華婦二名及中國少女一名、車抵日方哨兵站處、伊氏卽出呈美國護照及其他各證明文件、日本哨兵向染之提箱一瞥之後、卽對彼言、最好向旭街方面走、同時該華婦等亦因携有食物之故、不得放行、因此伊文司卽如命向旭街方面行、但至旭街後、該處之哨兵、又不令通過、且操英語曰、「應走萬國橋、伊氏卽謂渠來自萬國橋　萬國橋之日哨兵曾謂應走此間者、該日哨兵卽謂　誤矣、余將以電話通知該方之日哨兵、此時華婦等業已下車、故僅渠一人、再向萬國橋方面去、孰知至該處後、又吿被阻、直至日哨兵啟閱渠這提箱、見無食物時始吿放行云、又在伊文司對美領署之報吿中、曾將某西人飯店中之女僕西人每日在日方哨兵綫上之遭遇、附帶言之、蓋日方不惜他人之時間、而予以消磨也、（卅一日合衆社特派員吉爾電）</p>

<h3>美國海軍應保有　兩面作戰實力　俾蔑視條約國知所戒懼　海長力為擴軍計畫辯護</h3>
<p>華盛頓　海長愛通遜今日在參院海軍委員會中、力主美國應增强國防至蔑視條的諸國、在以美爲其攻擊鵠的以前將再三思之之程度、愛氏曰、「吾人之力如不充足、則吾人之利益、吾人賣貴之自由、吾人之財富、必將成彼蔑視條的或蔑視吾人所認爲國家完整者之諸國之攻擊鵠的、海軍部鑒於一九四〇年之世界大局、決定美國應趕快開造新軍艦、而儘可能之速度以完成之、美國必須準備應付至惡劣之局勢、假使美國之艦隊實力弱於吾人潛能的敵國聯合之海軍力、則吾人目前之艦隊必須認爲不適於用、惟美國如能作鞏固之準備、則即橫暴之國欲冒與美國衝突之險、亦必再三思之矣、海軍部提出之程序如經通過、足成有力的布吿、使意圖侵略之諸國不敢妄動、美國擬對其本國與所有之利益作有效之保護、以對待此類國家」云、（三十日國際新聞社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　美國海軍部長愛迪遜今日在衆院海務委員會中稱、美國爲達成其國防上之安全計、必須維持原來十三萬萬美金之海軍擴張案、蓋在目前之戰爭中、美國必須能有同時擊敗來自大西洋與來自太平洋敵人之力量也、今日之戰爭、則各友邦之力量即將轉成反對我美之力量、故在理論上、我人可將英法之海軍、列入友軍之陣營內、但實際上我人之海軍須有獨立作戰之力量、因此美國必須維持其在太平洋之力量、同時更須另建大西洋之海軍、」唯衆院海務委員會則多主張一種較原來計劃减半之三年計劃、其中另有一部份人則主張縮成二年計劃、將添造新艦七十七艘之計劃减少二十一艘、據業院海務委員共和黨議員具芝稱、假若採取海部所提之造艦計劃、則今後三年內每年之造艦費皆有八萬萬美金之鉅、（三十一日合衆社電）</p>
<p>僅施經濟壓力不足使日就範</p>
<p>紐約　名記者李浦曼頃在共和黨紐約民聲講壇報、撰文分析遠東局勢、其言有曰、或以為美國倘在經濟上行使壓力、日本即可讓步、此實皮相之談、揆日本之意旨、欲在遠東方面摧毀美國「可能的各與國」之威力、為達到此項目標起見、日本將與歐洲方面各國、現與吾國在遠東方面「可能的各與國」作戰者樹立同盟關係、其對於吾國並不直接進行攻擊、以攻擊吾國各友邦爲事、俾與吾國不致發生戰事、而仍可陷吾國於完全孤立、果爾、吾國他日倘不接受日本之擾勢、即須在極困難之情形下、單獨與之作戰、誠以吾國各與國倘在歐洲戰敗或筋疲力盡、並被逐出遠東、則美國力量無論如何强大、即無法同時在太平洋大西洋兩方面兼籌並顧、使人尊重美國利益、此種情形實日本所諗知也、共和黨參議員范登堡嘗於去年七月間、預料遠東問題倘無歐洲各國出而參加、即無從予以解決、實屬一針見血之談、其鞭辟入裏、或非渠本意之所及」云、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美參院外委會　檢討美日關係　畢德曼氏極力主張　禁運案有實施必要</h3>
<p>華盛頓　參議院外交委員會、定於明日檢討美日兩國關係、幷研究今後所當採取之步驟、必要時當邀請赫爾國務卿出席報告、或就美日兩國一般關係進行調查、該委員會主席畢德曼頃向報界發表談話稱、以目前情勢而論、余深信仍有在商務上對日實施各項限制辦法之必要、俾得促使日本對於各國在華利益、出以較爲妥協之態度云、關於此事、國務院當局見解如何、迄今尚未有所洩露、特政界人士認爲國會倘能通過法案、授權國務院於必要時以經濟制裁手段加諸日本、此在該院當局自所歡迎、至就參院外交委員會各委員態度而論、除畢德曼及其他若干委員一向主張對日制裁外、彼孤立派要人范登堡·奈埃·與華格納三人、則仍反對以强硬手段對付日本、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　赫爾國務卿宣稱、關於對日實施出口禁令一事、現正容愼考慮中、俟對一切可能之反響詳細研究後、始能加以決定、並謂參院外交委員會明日開會討論對日禁運問題時、余不擬出席報吿、則以余所具見解、業已非正式通知該委員會故也云、（三十日海通電）</p>
<p>東京　據外務省發言人須磨今日稱、假若美國實施參院外交委員會主席畢德曼所主張之對日輸出禁運、則日本人民勢將認爲一種對日本之侮辱、據須磨對美國記者言、日本認日美間目前之無條的狀態極爲不妥、假若美國更於此時實施對日之禁運、則勢將給予日本惡劣之印象、蓋日本自美日商的滿期以來、對美態度毫無變史、且力求兩國關係之調整、至於長江與珠江之開放、則無論在東京方面與當地之負責當局方面、皆竭力準備其早日實現、（卅一日合衆社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐戰有向近東推移的可能嗎？</h3>
<p>歐戰自從西錢成膠着狀態以來，一般觀察家或以爲德國將隨春季的到臨，而向馬奇諾防綫作正面的突擊；或以爲德國將侵犯荷比中立，而側擊法國；或以爲德國將採取大迂迴戰略，，而向巴爾幹半島進攻。這幾種觀察，各有其根據，而事實上祗能證明某一種觀察是對的。我們不問究竟那一種觀察恰合事實，但一般見解，都以爲英法的戰略，在實施長期封鎖，預備從經濟上迫使德國屈服；如此見解，當然亦屬大體不謬，但將來戰局是否這樣發展，還待事實證明；祗就雙方經濟和地理環境加以此較，德國確祗是利於攻而不利於守；而在攻的戰略上，又祗有向巴爾幹半島進攻的一條路綫，較有出奇制勝之望，似屬事半功倍之謀。因爲馬奇諾防綫是英法主力集中的所在，荷比兩國的軍力雖不及德國，但因歷史的敎訓，現在至少已經過幾個月的防禦佈置；又和英法相距不遠，極易取得援助，故德國進攻時，勢必犧牲大而成功難。至若向巴爾幹半島方面發展，那就情形兩樣：羅保等國的軍力，固不足以抗德；而英法的援助，却又是鞭長莫及，這一戰略比較上是輕而易舉；何况巴爾幹半島各國，力量小而分，願望大而雜；一朝有事，各先其所私，故最有各個擊破之可能。</p>
<p>從軍事上作平面的觀察，巴爾幹的氣象轉變，勢力消長，並非歐戰勝敗的決定因素；但平面觀察是不夠的。德國既有向巴爾幹半島進攻的最大可能性，因此鄰近巴爾幹半島的近東各國，最近也就充滿了火藥的氣氛。據各地電訉，有傳德國即將擴張軍事行動於高加索·伊拉克·伊朗·及阿拉伯一帶；有傳英法也已囤集大軍於近東各地，準備應付未來事變；甚至有謠傳伊朗·阿富汗·伊拉克和土耳其，擬即訂立軍事同盟，及伊朗軍隊已經實行動員的。總之。最近局勢，可說已達相當緊張的程度。近東和英法的作戰前途，有極密切關係；就經濟方面言，英國所需的煤油，大部分是取給於伊朗和伊拉克；而伊拉克的小麥和棉花，更是供給英國的主要食料和原料。就軍事言，溝通地中海和紅海交通的蘇彝士運河，完全受近東巴勒士坦的控制；而叙利亞和伊拉克，更是近束兩個最重要的軍事據點。若近東方面英法勢力受了頓挫，則英法和亞洲的聯絡就會發生重大困難；軍事活動也將爲之减削；而在菲洲的殖民地，也有遭受威脅攻擊的危險。</p>
<p>因爲近東的地位這樣重要，所以歐戰各國，對於這一個軍事的和經濟的據點，無不重視。不過近東的局勢非常複雜，若望近東遽爾發生何種變化，或望近東因脅誘而產生何種反應，事實上殊有所難能。德國若想攻擊這一個據點，須看德蘇的結合强度怎樣。蘇聯認德國向巴爾幹半島，進攻，直接影響到了蘇聯的勢力西展；若再進向近東，那就要和蘇聯的勢力更相尖銳對立；這在蘇聯整個的策略上，就未便聽任德國這個計割實現。比較具有可能性的，或由德國利用蘇聯勢力向近東的發展，間接來完成他的戰略</p>
<p>蘇聯自革命之後，對近東各國一向採取扶助弱小民族和解放被壓迫民族的外交旗幟；事實上確亦曾幫助土耳其復國，又先後和阿富汗伊朗等國交歡，誘使傾向蘇聯。自歐戰發生以來，蘇聯在近東方面，更多活動。過去的蘇土談判雖未成功，但是兩國的良好友誼依舊存在。最近蘇聯宣佈在伊期邊界建築鐵路，完成裏海和黑海間的聯絡，這更是顯然對近東有所圖謀。原來蘇聯既有强大的軍力，又具地理上的優勢，其所以不急於有所動作的原因，乃在機會的沒有成熟，藉口的不甚高明；英法倘使替他造成一個機會，予以一種藉口，如積極援助芬蘭等，則蘇聯就恐不免要在近東有所動作了。</p>
<p>英法對於近東，雖在軍事上和經濟上有其密切的借重，但是近東的內部，對於英法自來並不心悅誠服；去年巴勒士坦的暴動，即是一個例子。原來近東自第一次大戰結束之後，便以委任統治的方式，爲英法等國所分割；後來雖說已有一小部分宣布獨立，但是實際上仍遭受英法的支配和操縱；尤其是一切經濟利源，大都爲英法所占有。近年來近東各民族頗多希望獲得眞正的自由獨立，倘若有機可乘，他們會有不利於英法的嚴重表示；何况在近東的四周，除虎視眈眈的蘇聯外，義大利既不甘坐視消長，日本亦奢望染指。英法此後是否能保持近東而加以利用，這將要看英法能吾先行解決這些政治問題。吾則，德蘇併力向這個弱點進攻，則誰能保證歐局的重心，不向這方面推移呢？如果近東方面燃起了烽火，則德蘇所求之不得，而日本又必認爲機會，趁火打刧，一面掠取英法在亞洲的各殖民地，一面加緊壓迫英法在華權益。這就更要牽一髮而動全局了！</p>

<p>教育消息</p>
<h3>一九三九年　工部局教育處報告　校舍三所迫於環境業經出售</h3>
<p>滬市公共租界工部局一九三九年教育處報告如下、</p>
<p>當　戰發動之初、本局設立各校校舍均有緊急用途、因此各校不得不另覓臨時房屋、繼續開課、前年除校舍四所已返還本局外、其餘在臨時校舍內上課者、仍有十二校之多、上年並無校舍歸還本局前　改充工部局醫院之校舍三所、既未如願收回、即在蘇州河以北之校舍、欲求重行開放之難關、亦未打破、各校之臨時校舍、大都不甚適用、長此以往、殊為不宜、有校舍三所、（西童公學·漢壁禮宿舍及華童公學）因迫於環境、業經出售、因此各該學校勢須無定期繼續在臨時校舍內授課、尤屬可慮、</p>
<p>各校校務、既在上述環境之下進行、欲在任何方面、維持往昔之標準、勢不可能、各　職員固能任事勤懇、堅忍刻苦、然而因教育系統紊亂而發生之窒礙、未能完全排除、各校除已返歸原校舍者外、其餘因房屋窄狹、設備不全、致使課程之範圍與內容方面、均遭限制、</p>
<p>上年秋季學期、日校十六所之註冊學生、共計七·六〇七人、其中外籍學生占一·二八四人、華籍學生占六·三二三人、華籍學生之受中等教育者凡二·五六八人、受初等教育者凡三·七五五人、各項人數、與前年比較、無甚出入、僅　數相差十四人耳、</p>
<p>公立暨漢璧禮西童男女兩校之宿舍、仍租用極司非而路附近之房屋兩所、寄宿之男生計廿人、女生計廿四人、</p>
<p>上年之新發展、有足以記載者一點、即添闢第四夜校乙所、專收青年工人、若輩未受基本教育、故所授課程、頗為簡易、各夜校附設於工部局小學內、截至年底為止、學生人數、總計一·三二三人、</p>
<p>工部局各校學生人數比較表列后、一九三六年至三九一九年（秋季學期）</p>
<p>（學費及獎學金）上年九月間、本局鑒於以上各校、所需開支大見增加、因此對於增收學費問題、曾　以考量、查上年全年所需教育經費、比預算書所列數額、　　超出國幣三四〇·〇〇〇元、如情形繼續不變、則一九四〇年各西童學校之支出、預計比一九三八年約增百分之四三·七、各華童學校之支出、均增百分之三八·五、西童學校之開支較多、則所擯增加之學費、亦應較多、當經議決各西童學校自上年十一月一日起、加收學費百分之二五、各華童學校自本年春季起、加收學費百分之一五、上項附加費、估計全年可收國幣十萬元、</p>
<p>上年華童中學內優秀學生取得獎學金者凡七人、連同六月間舉行入學考試時成績優良而獲得獎學金之新生十四人、共計廿一人、均邀免繳學費全數及書籍各費、此外尚有舊生卅一名曾於任年獲得獎學金、各經展期一年、至西童學校學生、視其成績與家庭經濟狀況、得免繳全部或一部份學費者、計有四人、</p>
<p>（領受補助金之學校）上年申請發給補助金之華人私立學校、共一七八所、內新校卅五所、舊校一四三所、其申請書均經教育委員會特設之小組委員會分別審核、結果經核准者凡一四七校、惟有一附帶條件、即各該學校之設備、均須合乎本局各處之規定、經核准分配之補助金、共計國幣二二〇·〇〇〇元、有學校十六所、因多種原因、取消其補助金</p>
<p>發給外僑學校之補助金、共計國幣一九〇·〇〇〇元、其中一三九·〇〇〇元係撥給日本居留民會所辦之日僑學校九所者、</p>
<p>各私立學校領取補助金數額比較如下（一九三一年至一九三九年）</p>
<h3>復興中的浙西教育（三）</h3>
<p>浙西目前的中等教育情況、略如上述、至於小學教育、各縣亦都表示蓬勃的現象、安吉縣從二十八年三月到七月止、這短短的四個月中、已經恢復了四十二所小學、學生總數達二千七百四十五人、孝豐現有縣立中心小學五所、鄉鎮和私立小學五九所、短期小學十六所、流動小學三所、合計學生四午餘人、臨安現有完全小學四所、初級小學一百另三所、縣立短期小學九所、流動學校二所、學生總數達五千九百四十五人、以上三縣、均已完全恢復戰前學校數量、</p>
<p>杭縣縣境雖已全部淪陷、但也隨了政治的推進、在淪陷區設立小學十九所、同時塘樓三敦等市鎮的私立小學、都來請求立案、餘杭縣縣境雖然已經大部分淪陷、而且所剩的也祗是些窮僻的山鄉、但本學期都也設立了三十八所小學，而且有半數是設在日人的勢力範圍之下的、該二縣設在已淪陷地區的學校、因為日人時常來騷擾、遂以私塾的外形掩護戰時教育的推行、也確是煞費苦心的事、長興的泗安鎮經過日人二次的竄攫、全部房屋、都遭焚燬、但隨着克復後市面的繁榮和人口的增加、已經在嚴區長領導這下、設立完全小學二所、和初級小學二所、學生數量比戰前並沒有減少、近月來盛傳日人有進犯泗安的企圖、而泗安中心小學、還在安然地建造新年的校舍、斷垣殘壁的瓦礫場中、重新建樹起戰時教育中心、</p>
<p>其他浙西各縣、因為記者進出戰區、時遇搜索、所以沒有詳細的統計、不能向讀者作同樣的報告、但隨着第二期抗戰中浙西軍事的進展、和政治的推進、一定能同樣地、使教育事業迅速地恢復、走上復興的道路、</p>

<p>男女性生活對於健康的影響</p>
<p>男子們讀了本文，保證一生壽考康甯　生殖腺內分泌液，確是男子生命源泉。</p>
<p>關於男女性行為的一回事，在從前封建社會裏，都諱莫如深；尤其一般所謂「道學先生」們對於男女兩性問題的討論，簡直認為大逆不道。以致一般青年男女，要解決兩性問題的時候，好像盲人騎瞎馬一樣，這是多麽的危險呢！</p>
<p>性是人之本能，其重要等於飲食。所以在文明社會裏，對於兩性智識的檢討，早已精益求精，日新月異，其實獻於人類亦至大且巨。世間不知有多少沉淪在苦海中的男女，因此而已獲救了！</p>
<p>人不能做超人，所以禁慾是萬分困難的！並且禁慾的弊害義生。然縱慾亦決非相宜。研究動物學者想誰多知道。在動物界中竟多因不得性交而致死亡者，但也有因性交過分而致死亡者！人們若不能控制其性的衝動，營適當而美滿的性生活，其弊害也是一言難盡。我們只要看男子於早年犯有手淫，遺精，早婚縱慾，荒淫無度，……致虧損了生殖腺內分泌液者，則凡陽痿，發育不全腰酸背痛，神經衰弱，腦弱緊虧等症即不一而足。於是雖有嬌妻美妾，亦不能營美滿的性生活，這怎能不使妻子憎恨呢？由此使夫婦反目，演出忌內，私奔，離婚，自殺等家醜與悲劇者，何可勝數！或竟因此而致健康喪失，人生消極，影響於求學及職業的前途，或竟因此而致未老先衰，短命殀殤者亦所在多見！</p>
<p>上述因生殖腺虧損所致的病態，近因新醫學的進步，已有最對症而　效的療法，此即積極服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」是也。並此療法已為世界名醫所公認，經治癒之男子亦不下數午百萬人。誠以此劑質料名貴，監製精良，性質溫和，補力偉大。為任何類似。為任何類似製劑所不及。服後於一日夜間即生精補腎，健腦活血，連服不斷，更能助長發育，滋養神經，必於短期內治癒各症。中老年人常服延年益壽，返老還童，惟患遺精滑精症者，須兼服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」（中西五洲中英華美等大藥房及永安公司西樂部均售每瓶實價兩元）以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速！</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯萎癟的不幸及挽救</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>感丰富，身材窈窕的健美女郎，不但男子們見了，要心旌搖搖，愛慕不止。即她們女性對女性，因自身的發育不能　乎美滿，　瞧着別人的身　　麽靈活，乳峯那麽高聳，臀部那麽丰腴，也要自慚形穢，嘖嘖稱嘆。不甯惟是，而且乳峯高聳，臀部丰腴的健美女性，因生殖腺卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛之故。性情亦非常溫柔，思想敏捷，肌肉白嫩，面頰更似中酒微醉，泛出媚人的紅　。如果瑞在這個紅暈的俏臉上，　上一對彎彎的娥眉，秋水似的　目，輕盈的酒渦，這是多麽嫵媚而可愛。此等女性，不特到為香噴噴，甜蜜蜜，為人尊敬，為人追求。即於夫婦之間的私生活上，雙方亦無不如膠如漆，情好特濃，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，其幸福必無量！</p>
<p>但話又要說回來了。如過去曾犯束胸自瀆，白帶不感，月經不調，營養不良，多産流産，惡　經年，重症侵害，以致生殖腺卵巢機能遭遇摧殘，影響新陳代謝作用者。則乳峯必無良好之發育，呈萎癟平坦之醜態，健美喪失，曲線毫無，此種女性，不惟交際場中，休想佔得一席地，受人歡迎，即退而至於在家庭里，亦每為男子厭惡，其命運必非常悲慘！惟時至今日，雖有此等不幸，亦不必恢心，蓋科學萬能，現在已有一種生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用「生殖素」可以挽救了。此劑的成分，係採強壯動物之卵巢素，並和以礦植物之燐鈣鐵，及維他命等在科學的管理下，精密配製。故藥性非常和平，功效非常偉大，如在此冬令進補時服之。尤能發揮獨特的效果，久服不但可以調經種子，烏發美顔，同時能使萎癟的乳峯，隆然聳起，增進健美。</p>
<h3>遺精是生命的浪費</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念會</p>
<p>一粥一飯，當思來處不易：半絲半縷，恒念物力維艱；物，尚且不可以浪費，何況是我們最神聖而可貴的生命呢！我們的身體，好像一部機器。機器須用機油來潤澤，然後各部機能才能靈動。我們身體內的各部機能所賴於潤澤者，那就是生殖腺內分泌液（精液）。此種內分泌腺係無管腺，包括着腦下垂體，松果腺，腎腺，睾丸腺等多種，可直接滲入血液，藉血液循環而灌溉全身，滋潤着腦，脊髓，性各部神經，俾發生各咱不同而又相補為用的機巧之功能。所以腦可以思，手可以工作，脚可以行走……遂成有機巧而為萬物之靈的人們。至於皮骨血肉……這不過等於一部機器中的各種機件而已！所以科學可造機器人，而不能造有生命的人，這就是生殖腺內分泌液與各部神經的奧妙作用所在；也由此可知生殖腺內分泌液，實猶如生命源泉的貴重。使之健康而豐足，則其人必聰明而活潑，有遠大的前程。若不知自愛，犯有手淫，縱慾，荒淫，或憂勞　傷，致摧殘了生殖腺內分泌機能，使精關鬆馳者，必爆發可怕的遺精症。遺精之為害，等於浪費生命！若因循失治則凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎痿早洩，發育不全等症象即不一而足。如此，使聰明者將變為愚笨；活潑者將變為呆板，勇敢者將變為怯懦，世間青春因此而誤前途，喪失人生幸福，或竟短命者，何可勝數？！</p>
<p>遺精症並不是不治之症。如能積極服特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」必可收藥到病除之功，此早已為世界名醫所公認。因此藥，確有鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，服後於當夜即可安眠止遺之特效。惟因遺精已有上述症象者，須兼服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，助長發育，連服不斷，必於短期內治癒各症。益發健康。患者能親來本診所診治，更可保證治癒。</p>

<h3>糧食　國米一律售限價　且又過之而無不及　民食恐慌情勢愈緊</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源、因大結束期近，由虹口轉出者寥寥無幾、而本鄉店　活動、亦為數不多、惟售方心思尚堅、晨初喊聲仍高、價格續升、現下米價已無正市、厚薄粳及早晚稻價均售四十元、尚得謂之限價存在、以致各貨暗盤層出、實際上均已高出限價數元不等、米店所售四十元之日起米，大都惡劣異常、白元等行情亦無甚上落、高如溧陽貨開四十元、次之東京白元為三十七元七角、蘆羊尖無市。</p>

<p>小麥昨交易頗為沉寂、蓋目下來源既阻、存底稀薄、年囤心思堅硬、均擬待諸陰曆新年紅盤再售、故市場出售寥寥、已呈結束景象、除少數直接配廠外、僅福新廠辦去蘇州麥三百包、價仍為二十元、其他交易概無所聞、</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>孩子的前途</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>近來希奇古怪的花邊新聞，似乎越來越多了。</p>
<p>譬如那個曾經『以敎書爲生』的王某，利用十二歲的孿生子去告地狀求乞，結果被捕房方面以詐欺罪起訴這一件事，就是一個很好的例子。</p>
<p>王某以敎過書的人，對於自己正在生長發育中的兩個兒子，不但不曾好好地予以敎導，反而叫他們去跪地求乞，這種舉動，是否犯了捕房當局所告的欺詐罪，我們固不敢說；可是王某罪有應得，這一點我們却敢斷言。因爲王某是正在破壞他的兩個兒子的前途，如果不是捕房方面發覺得早，社會上兩個有用的孩子的將來，眞是不堪設想了！</p>
<p>拿王某這種危害社會的舉動，來和僅僅欺騙幾個過路的人慷慨解囊比較，其罪孽的深重，眞是不可以道里計。固然，在現行的法律中，也許還沒有『破壞兒女的前途』或『製造危害社會人物』這種罪名存在着，可是我們對於這更重要的一方面，無論如何是不應該予以忽略的。</p>
<p>我們希望未來的社會上，『兒童的敎育』會成爲每個父母的必修課程，而『貽誤子弟』的罪狀，法律上也有明文規定。這樣一來，將來的無辜的孩子們，也許可以享受一種更合理的敎育與待遇吧。</p>
<p>特稿</p>
<h3>荷蘭印象</h3>
<p>— 仁人</p>
<p>這幾天從國際新聞頻頻傳來關於荷蘭邊境緊張狀况和國內動員等等消息，使我不能不回憶到六個月前在荷所見當時寗靜，和平的景象，並關懷着留在那邊近千的僑胞和無數熱心援華工作的國際友人。</p>
<p>荷蘭天然風景的美麗，在國際間是相當有名的，因此曾有不少人譽之爲北歐的公園；到了郊外，景物更是優美了，那四處縱橫的潑淸河沼，豐盛的田野，再加上那些荷蘭特殊式樣的精緻房屋，矮矮屋頂拖地的廬舍，和偶而可見的風車等等，一切眞使人如進入西洋童話中『仙樹林』的境界。荷蘭人的好潔也的確名不虛傳，像他們的住宅罷，就不論他們房屋是如何簡陋，他們的窗戶總少不了潔白的窗簾點綴着，每家都是如此，像房屋的制服似的。大槪因爲他們房屋多數是採用木料建成，易於洗濯，每隔二三年他們就得把房屋裏作大淸掃一次；在荷短短期間，我就無數次見到那些荷蘭人穿了大木鞋爬在大梯上拚命在洗掃屋頂及圍牆，這的確是荷蘭特有的風光。</p>
<p>荷蘭這國家是比較的富裕，因此國內很少極端的貧窮的人民，但這也並不是說他們已全進入了衣暖食飽的狀况，你在荷京亞姆司達城的巷尾街頭，就常有一些穿陳舊衣服的變相的乞丐奏着小提琴或手風琴等待路人施捨；在大道旁的長凳上，也常坐了不少垂頭喪神等待政府救濟的失業者。他們敎育雖然相當普及，可是大學敎育因爲高昂的學費，却祇限於資產階級的子弟，因此在去年八月中旬我離荷時，聽說一部份大學生正在醞釀要求减低學費運動呢。</p>
<p>誰都聽過荷蘭女皇的名字吧。荷蘭至今仍是君主立憲國家；在國會保守勢力雖然佔優勢，然而其他一些急進黨派依然可以合法存在的，人民是有着信仰集社出版言論上的自由。但在這裏仇得注意，就是這些公民權利只對荷蘭公民而言，至於那些在荷的荷屬東印度殖民地人民或入荷籍的華僑的政治活動，却又被嚴厲地監視和限制着。</p>
<p>去年夏天，在荷各地散居着的僑胞，約近千餘，其中以廣東及浙江靑田籍居多；他們的職業不是作小買賣的經營，便是在海輪中擔任工役，生活當然是相當艱苦，但是雖然如此，對祖國的捐款却非常踴躍，有一次在某援華大會中，我就親眼見過一個中國工人把金戒子從手上脫下來，慷慨地擲入捐盆，把全塲人士都感動得高呼起來。近日報紙上又載着大批華工回國的消息，這正在生長中的新中國該不會使萬里歸來的兒女失望的吧。</p>

<h3>美國總統的生活</h3>
<p>— 子安</p>
<p>全美民　所愛戴的總統羅斯福，在前天正是五十八歲，全國各地均開跳舞會熱烈慶祝，把所得的錢捐助為「小兒麻痺症基金」，因爲羅斯福以前曾患此症。下文把羅斯福的日常生活告訴我們。——編者</p>
<p>美國大總統羅斯福氏，雖然獲得一萬五千鎊的年俸，但他的生活，却實樸儉約，不亞於平民。</p>
<p>他現在已經是個五十人歲的人，但因他起居飲食辦公娛樂有秩序，有規律，所以精神還極健旺。</p>
<p>他每晨八時前即起身，盥洗後便趨至整容室整容，整容後略進早點；蛋花，梅醬麵包爲他最愛吃的晨餐。餐後，便開始讀報，十幾種日報，他一頁一頁翻閱，大約須費一小時的光陰，方能讀畢。趁此二三十分鐘餘暇，散步廊前，十時三十分到十二時接見國務員等，星期日例外；大約他每日所接見人數約二三十人之譜。他的午餐，所吃的不過湯，燒味（鷄，鴨，鴿鳥等類），生菜，咖啡，幾樣簡單的肴饌。午後在辦公室裏批閱公文，有時召見屬員會商政務。五時後，離了辦公室，在白宮游泳池裏游泳，不論寒暑，他每天總費耗三十分鐘時間在游泳池裏，游泳爲羅總統唯一的嗜好。晚膳所吃的比較豐富些，餐後便退居書室，從事著作，或草擬演說稿，大總統衣食方面的享受，是極端質樸而平民化的。</p>
<p>美國總統府——白宮，壯麗巍峨，美奐美輪。白宮經常開支，列入政府預算費之內，每年約需二千八百六十歲鎊。舉凡裝飾，冷暖氣設備，水電消耗，以及花圃開支，房屋修葺等等費用，一統包括在內。白宮有臥室二十一間，健身房一間，游泳池一處，各室案頭架上，陳設着各種各色花瓶，每晨園丁須剪採千枝美花，分挿各瓶，以供淸賞。白宮裏玻璃花圃，建築費價値數百萬鎊之鉅，管理這玻璃花圃的總園丁，年已蒼老，他在白宮花圃裏幹了很多年，頗得羅總統所嘉許。</p>
<p>白宮裏有汽車夫十二名，關於汽油，滑油，車夫工資，車夫制服，每年所耗的經費，爲數亦頗可觀。車夫服裝費每人每年約需六十鎊左右，政府特地　年撥五千鎊的經費，充總統的旅行費用，另外備花車一列，遊船一艘，供總統乘坐。美國大總統關於住行方面的享受，是再痛快沒有了。</p>

<p>那位太太覺得奇怪了，她說：「出世嗎？我的孩子已經五歲了！」</p>
<p>「我的天，太太，」派克喊了起來，「趕快回去，別站在這裏跟我講話；你已經失去最寳貴的五年了。」</p>

<h3>影王酷愛中國</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>最近選出的影王米蓋羅納，隸屬米高梅公司，年十九歲。他在去年和秀蘭鄧波兒，狄安娜寶萍等並列前茅，今年更獨占鱉頭，可算倖運兒了。他出身很苦，父親爲一戲劇家，他自幼有歌唱和幽默天才。米蓋羅納的作風，大體摹仿克拉蓋博兒和李昂巴里摩亞。他的成功作品是「金玉滿堂」。現爲米高梅的基本演員，每星期薪金一千美金，每拍一片拆帳一萬美金。</p>
<p>他的生活是多方面的，喜歡音樂藝術舞蹈運動，家中有一個游泳池。也會彈弄鋼琴和梵啞鈴，這和他的一副歌喉原是相配的。他的情人是「金玉滿堂」及「綠野仙踪」片中的女主角麥蒂加倫，兩人感情很熱。米蓋羅納對於東方的知識，也有相當研究。他在「金玉滿堂」一片中戲唱道：「好朋友，今日樂哉，我決和加羅里的臭虫惡鬥，我也要觀光中日棋局大戰。」他儘可能在學一點東方的作風，甚至學習中國話。今夏他拍完「法官哈台」一片，或將趁假期買棹來華一遊呢。</p>
<h3>談「女兒國」</h3>
<p>— 水沫</p>
<p>說不出是喜歡還是憎恨，每年得渡兩個「新年」。新的新年過去了，舊的新年即將到來。人們又在計畫着怎樣來渡過它。上海劇藝社也在計畫着，以什麼新的東西貢獻給新歲；據一般的猜想總又是歷史戲，其實這　劇目的安排完全出乎人們意料之外的。這是于伶的一個新的劇作，是他寫「女子公寓」「花濺淚」後又一個以女人爲中心的著作，可以稱爲「女人」三部曲之一。但是在作風上完全改變了，那是寫幾個女人的幻想，她們想成仙，想到了發在，作者用幻想的表現方法把它在舞臺上具象出來，於是一切希奇古怪的形態便在舞臺表現出來了。是舞臺上從未用過的技巧都在這裏嘗試着了。船隻的在狂風怒濤中駛行，女人在船上狂歌狂舞，忽而有仙人出現。這裏有女人從舞臺底下鑽出舞臺而來。這裏的服裝，古老的是明朝衣服，新鮮的幾乎是一九五〇年新裝。奇異瑰麗，眞有點跟「綠野仙踪」差不多。可是這是幻想曲，幻想破滅時，給予這些女人的依舊是失望。在演員方面，也採取了All　Starcast，有呂吉，楊帆，夏霞，藍蘭，小鳳，慕蓉婉兒，徐立等。將來用音樂的節奏，誇大的喜劇形式演出時，一定會給人們以新的印象的。</p>
<h3>「苦痛」公演</h3>
<p>— 遊記者</p>
<p>農曆年終，舊戲界向有封箱的習慣，新都劇塲亦於四日起停演三天，七日除夕，則公演「苦痛」一劇，作爲暴露舊社會形形色色的寫實作。申曲界把社會題材加以新思想的改製，而且在重要節日來公演，這不能說不是一個進步的良好現象，「苦痛」的內容是寫廢曆除夕都會中各階層生活的內外面，用客觀的批判的眼光作有力的烘托，雖然，將來演出上的效果如何，不得而知，但這總是申曲藝人漸漸走向覺悟進步的途徑了。</p>

<p>當時演戲三日三夜六工戲，彼共誤了六塲，每塲必誤，名不虛傳。（少山及到後台，數分鐘內，畫臉即成，裝束亦快，若唱探陰山，鎖五龍，一面唱倒板，一面整鈕繫帶，唱畢，上塲矣，匆忙得可笑，）戲屬義務，吾無辦法也；然而誤是誤，紅是紅，聞少山今在北平自己組班，獨挑大樑，不知能改習慣而不誤戲否？少山之誤戲，猶不足爲奇，今聞更有奇者，足資笑談，某小生昔常依名旦，近不常出演，意態潦倒，搭某班時，數誤戲，管事者不之罰，仍給戲份，彼習以爲例，總遲過本人戲碼約半小時，始携一跟包人背行頭珊珊而至，戲旣誤，行頭包裹無庸放下，仍山原人肓背而回，會有人言於管事者，謂其所携包裹中並非當日演戲行頭，可試觀之。一日，又如是遲到誤戲，管事者命其主僕姑少坐休息，乘間開其行頭包，見係破爛衣物，眞非當日演戲行頭也，問共故，初不吐實，旣而苦言曰，行頭皆付典當，每日遲到，亦以此也，從此某小生搭班無所，梨園中傳爲話柄。</p>
<p>戲史氏曰，往昔伶人無敢誤戲，法律嚴也，輓近將驕令弛，誤戲之奇，有如上述，某小生之誤由於窘，不知奮發，亦可哀矣。金少山之誤由於懶，盛時人諒之，一旦若嗓敗而氣衰，則人將厭之矣，使其能改常習，豈不善哉！食焉而怠其事，吾爲之危，凡自愛伶人，敬恭將事可也。</p>

<h3>Japanese Occupy Xiaoshan City, Besieged; Chinese Forces Continue to Recapture Many Strongholds; Northern Hubei Chinese Forces Achieve Complete Victory, Advance Southward, Approaching Suixian County, All Remaining Japanese in the Vicinity of Guojiazhai Eliminated</h3>
<p>Jinhua: After the Chinese recapture of Kanshan Town, sweeping operations continued on the 28th. Currently, no Japanese traces are found in the vicinity and at places like Mojia Port and Youtangtou. Hangwu Mountain and Jiang Bridge have both been recovered. Furthermore, the Japanese who entrenched themselves on Seven Sages Mountain and Maoshanjian, awaiting reinforcements, were completely annihilated by the entire Chinese force on the 29th. At present, the remaining Japanese are trapped inside Xiaoshan City, which is under fierce attack by the Chinese forces. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>Fancheng: After the Japanese army in northern Hubei was annihilated by more than ten thousand by the Chinese forces in northern Sui, morale is extremely low. Taking advantage of the victory, the Chinese army advanced and eliminated the remaining Japanese near Guojiazhai the day before yesterday, killing more than three hundred Japanese soldiers. Following this, they advanced and approached Suixian County. The remaining Japanese are entrenched on the city walls, daring not to engage in battle. The Chinese army is currently fiercely attacking. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>Fancheng: It has been snowing in northern Hubei since the 29th, and the front line has become quiet. The Japanese army in central Hubei, unable to withstand the pressure from the Chinese forces, continues to send reinforcements day and night. Under the cover of intense artillery fire, the Japanese army on the Jing-Zhong Road launched an offensive from Jujialing on the morning of the 30th, but was met with a head-on blow from the Chinese forces and retreated with injuries. The Chinese forces are currently pursuing them. (31st telegram)</p>
<p>Miluo: The Chinese forces, penetrating deep into the rear of the Japanese army in southern Hubei and northern Hunan, have been actively operating recently, achieving many victories. On the 21st, they launched a fierce attack on Cikou Xikengtang, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army. They also completely destroyed the highway bridges near Shuibentou, west of Changtan, and Wudong Bridge. Another unit completely blew up the iron bridge north of Wang Shengmao, south of Hesheng Bridge, on the 22nd. Japanese advances were repeatedly repelled by the Chinese forces, leaving many corpses behind. (31st telegram)</p>
<p>Nanyang: The Japanese army in Xinyang has suffered heavy losses after repeated attacks by the Chinese forces. The day before yesterday, they gathered more than a thousand Japanese soldiers and seven artillery pieces to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese forces from Jigong Mountain. After a head-on blow and a day of bloody battle, the Japanese army was unable to withstand it and fled in defeat, abandoning more than three hundred corpses. The Chinese forces are currently pursuing them. (31st telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Southern Shanxi Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou: The Japanese army in southern Shanxi, numbering about six to seven thousand, has been engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army in areas southeast of Wenxi, northeast of Xiaxian, and southeast of Anyi for the past ten days, repeatedly attacking and seizing positions. The battle situation is extremely fierce. The Japanese army is gradually faltering due to heavy losses. The Chinese forces are currently stepping up their efforts to annihilate them separately. Furthermore, a unit of the Japanese army is still engaged in battle with the Chinese in the area around Wuziguanzhuang Zhongshijian, east of Yicheng. (31st telegram)</p>
<p>Xingji: After suffering another severe blow from the Chinese army this time, the Japanese army in southeastern Shanxi has been in a state of chaos and retreat northward. The Chinese army has been actively advancing towards Changzhi, Changzi, Huguan, Baodian, and other places for days. The officers and soldiers are exceptionally brave, and the Japanese morale is wavering. In the battles to recapture Shidian, Bayi, and other places, the Chinese army seized many spoils of war, especially warhorses and documents. The Chinese forces west of the Qin River are continuing their siege. The fighting is particularly fierce around Fengshen Temple, Shifocun, and Aoxiang Mountain near Yicheng. In southwestern Shanxi, more than a thousand Japanese soldiers from Gudui, Xinjiang, with seven mountain field guns, invaded westward twice on the 24th and 26th, but were repelled by the Chinese forces. On the morning of the 27th, they divided their forces into two groups. One group went from Xinjiang to Qiaogou Village, setting fire to everything in sight, while the other group went from Fencheng to the north of Sucun, attempting to attack Shimenyu. The Chinese defenders met them head-on and fought fiercely all day. By night, the Japanese, having suffered heavy losses, began to retreat towards Fencheng and the north and south of Fanzhuang. The Chinese forces are currently pursuing them separately. (30th telegram)</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops in Southern Henan Defect in Large Numbers</h3>
<p>Luoyang: After the puppet troops in southern Henan defected in large numbers, the Japanese army became extremely panicked and strengthened their defenses. Zhang Qihuang, the commander-in-chief of the puppet troops, is now suspected, and more than two hundred of his guards have been disarmed by the Japanese in a certain location on the Ping-Han Railway. (30th telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Western Sui Suffers Heavy Losses and Retreats; Chinese Guerrillas Active Between Suiyuan and Baotou, Japanese Plane Shot Down Being Transported to the Rear</h3>
<p>Wuyuan: The Japanese army, numbering about a thousand, which invaded westward from Baotou and the south bank of the Yellow River, was ambushed by the Chinese on the afternoon of the 29th at Suhaitan in front of the Wula Mountains and Zhaodage Liang. After fierce fighting until night, the Japanese were unable to withstand it and retreated backward. The Chinese army is currently still pursuing them. (30th telegram)</p>

Another unit attacked a certain village in Sa County, seizing many military supplies such as guns, horses, and telephones. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>Wuyuan: A Japanese plane shot down by the Chinese on the 28th was manufactured in March of Showa 14 (1939). Most of the components are still intact. The Chinese side has sent mechanics to relocate and repair it, preparing to transport it to the rear. The plane dropped three bombs in a certain location, only injuring four cows and destroying three large carts, before being shot down. (30th telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Xintai Fails in Southern Offensive</h3>
<p>A certain location in Shandong: The Japanese army in Xintai launched an offensive towards the Chinese in several directions on the 24th. One group harassed the vicinity of Guli, and another group harassed the area around Liuquan (southwest of Xintai). After fierce attacks along the way, and a day of fierce fighting, many Japanese were killed. The Japanese were unable to withstand it and retreated in defeat, abandoning more than a hundred corpses and a large amount of weapons and ammunition. (31st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Anqiu Suffers Heavy Blow</h3>
<p>A certain location in Shandong: The Japanese army in Anqiu advanced to the vicinity of Daxiaopo through Huajialing on the 23rd. They were met with a counterattack by the Chinese army, and fierce fighting broke out. A fierce assault was launched, and the Japanese momentum was thwarted. Fighting continued until night. (31st telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Jiangmen and Sihui Area Robs Food</h3>
<p>Sihui: The Japanese army in the Jiangmen and Sihui area is extremely short of food and extremely panicked. On the 21st, they went to the vicinity of Hetang Township to rob rice.

Later, they went again, but were again killed more than two hundred by the villagers. Many guns and ammunition were seized in this battle. (31st telegram)</p>
<p>Meixian: On the night of the 26th, the Chinese army launched an attack on the Japanese army in Hailianshan, Guanchao, Hongan, and other places, destroying multiple layers of Japanese barbed wire and breaking into the Japanese阵地.

<h3>Japanese Army in Tianjin Blocks Food from Entering Concessions; Prices Soar Higher Than During Last Year's Flood; Only White Russians Can Carry Food into the Concessions</h3>
<p>Tianjin: According to the Japanese military spokesman today, the Japanese side has not imposed any restrictions on the transport of food into the concessions. However, this claim by the Japanese side is completely inconsistent with the facts. A reporter for the English-language "North China Star" newspaper, an American named Bao Wen, attempted to pass through the Japanese sentry line today with six dozen parrot eggs, but was stopped by a Japanese sentry. Although Bao Wen presented her American passport and the pass issued by the Japanese side, it was of no avail. Bao Wen indicated that she was willing to leave the parrot eggs behind, hoping to keep the chicken eggs, but the Japanese sentry still refused her request. Therefore, Bao Wen had no choice but to abandon all six dozen eggs. In addition, another foreign journalist was also stopped by a Japanese sentry for carrying five apples and was not allowed to enter the British and French concessions. However, these two foreign journalists did not intend to carry food to the concessions, but merely wanted to test whether the Japanese military spokesman's claim that the Japanese side did not restrict the transport of food into the concessions was true. This can be said to have already been confirmed. Furthermore, the Japanese side's restrictions on food entering the concessions can be clearly seen from the food prices in the concessions. Food that sold for only 35 cents a pound two weeks ago has now risen to $1.10 a pound. At the same time, it only sold for 60 cents a week ago. Before the two journalists conducted this test, the Japanese military spokesman insisted at a reception for journalists that the Japanese side had no intention of starving the concessions. The reporter then stated that the spokesman's words were not true, and that Japanese sentries did indeed prohibit food from being carried into the concessions. The spokesman then said that these sentries were all members of the Hirota squad, directly under the command of Commander Honma, and that there was no room for misunderstanding. However, each sentry had the right to handle matters at their own discretion. He also said that the Japanese side's attitude towards American residents was completely the same as its attitude towards British residents and residents of other countries (it is noted that when the Tianjin concessions were first blockaded last year, Americans enjoyed special treatment; the Japanese side's statement today shows that it has changed its attitude towards the United States). He also said that the reason why Japan hopes that third countries will cooperate in establishing a "New Order in East Asia" is that it hopes that third countries will adopt a friendly attitude towards Japan and not take a hostile attitude. Furthermore, at the meeting, the spokesman also said that if one wants convenience, there is nothing better than abolishing the concessions, because at that time, there will be no need for obstacles. Furthermore, the Japanese side has tightened its blockade of the concessions considerably. Countless trucks are waiting outside the barriers to enter the concessions, but only a very small number are allowed to enter the concessions. Many of these trucks have been waiting outside the barriers for as long as five days without being able to pass. As a result, the prices in the concessions are even higher than during last year's flood. At present, only White Russians in anti-communist organizations can carry food into the Japanese-controlled areas. As for British and American people, they are afraid of being insulted by Japanese sentries and are unwilling to make this attempt. (30th dispatch from Gilb, special correspondent of the United Press)</p>
<p>Tianjin: According to news from here today, the English-language "North China Star" reporter, the American woman Bao Wen, reported her experience at the Japanese sentry station yesterday, and the incident of her being prohibited from carrying six dozen parrot eggs to the British concession, to the American Consul General in Tianjin, Gottway. In addition, the American woman Evans, who arrived here from Shanghai on Monday, also encountered various difficulties at the Japanese sentry station. Therefore, Evans also reported her experiences to the American consul. It is reported that the American consul has listed the experiences of the two in his routine official report to Washington. At the same time, the American Chamber of Commerce here will also hold a meeting tonight to discuss the Japanese side's tightening of the blockade of the concessions and the shortage of food in the concessions, and believes that the situation is serious. It is noted that Evans is a well-known lawyer with a good reputation in China. According to her statement to the American United Press reporter, she arrived here from Shanghai on the afternoon of Monday and hired a car to proceed to the Wan'guo Bridge. In this car, there were also two Chinese women and a Chinese girl. When the car reached the Japanese sentry station, Evans presented her American passport and other certifying documents. After a glance at the lady's suitcase, the Japanese sentry said to her, "It is best to go to Asahi Street." At the same time, the Chinese women and others were not allowed to pass because they were carrying food. Therefore, Evans followed orders and went to Asahi Street. However, when she reached Asahi Street, the sentry there did not allow her to pass either, and said in English, "You should go to Wan'guo Bridge." Evans then said that she came from Wan'guo Bridge, and that the Japanese sentry at Wan'guo Bridge had said that she should go here. The Japanese sentry then said, "That's a mistake. I will notify the Japanese sentry on that side by telephone." At this time, the Chinese women and others had already gotten out of the car, so only she went to Wan'guo Bridge again. Who knew that when she reached that place, she was told to stop again, until the Japanese sentry opened her suitcase and saw that there was no food before he let her go. Furthermore, in Evans' report to the American Consulate, she mentioned the experiences of a Western maid from a certain Western hotel who was stopped by Japanese sentries every day, because the Japanese side did not care about wasting other people's time.

<h3>United States Navy Should Maintain Two-Front War Capability; So That Treaty-Scorners Know What to Fear; Navy Secretary Edison Defends Military Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>Washington: Navy Secretary Edison stated in the Senate Naval Committee today that the United States should strengthen its national defense to the point where countries that scorn treaties will think twice before making the United States their target of attack. Edison said, "If our strength is not sufficient, then our interests, our precious freedom, and our wealth will inevitably become the targets of attack by countries that scorn treaties or scorn what we consider to be national integrity. The Navy Department, in view of the world situation in 1940, has decided that the United States should quickly build new warships and complete them as quickly as possible. The United States must be prepared to deal with the worst-case scenario. If the strength of the US fleet is weaker than the combined naval power of our potential enemies, then our current fleet must be considered unsuitable for use. However, if the United States can make solid preparations, even tyrannical countries will have to think twice before risking a conflict with the United States. The procedures proposed by the Navy Department, if passed, will serve as a powerful announcement to prevent countries with aggressive intentions from acting rashly, and that the United States intends to effectively protect its country and all its interests in dealing with such countries," he said. (30th dispatch from International News Service)</p>
<p>Washington: US Secretary of the Navy Edison stated in the House Naval Affairs Committee today that in order to achieve its national defense security, the United States must maintain its original US$1.3 billion naval expansion plan, because in the current war, the United States must be able to simultaneously defeat enemies from the Atlantic and from the Pacific. In today's war, the strength of various friendly countries will soon turn into a force against the United States. Therefore, in theory, we can include the navies of Britain and France in the ranks of friendly forces, but in reality, our navy must have the strength to operate independently. Therefore, the United States must maintain its strength in the Pacific, and at the same time, it must build another Atlantic navy." However, many in the House Naval Affairs Committee advocated a three-year plan that was half of the original plan, and some even advocated shortening it to a two-year plan, reducing the plan to add 77 new ships by 21 ships. According to Republican Representative Chi, a member of the House Naval Affairs Committee, if the shipbuilding plan proposed by the Navy Department is adopted, the shipbuilding cost each year for the next three years will be as high as US$800 million.

<p>Economic Pressure Alone is Not Enough to Make Japan Comply</p>
<p>New York: Famous journalist Lippmann recently wrote an article in the Republican New York Tribune analyzing the situation in the Far East. He said, "Some believe that if the United States exerts economic pressure, Japan will give in. This is a superficial view. According to Japan's intentions, it wants to destroy the power of the United States' 'potential allies' in the Far East. In order to achieve this goal, Japan will establish an alliance with European countries that are currently at war with our country's 'potential allies' in the Far East. It will not directly attack our country, but will attack our allies, so that our country will not go to war, but will still be completely isolated. If so, if our country does not accept Japan's disturbance in the future, it will have to fight it alone in extremely difficult circumstances. Indeed, if our allies are defeated or exhausted in Europe, and are expelled from the Far East, then no matter how strong the United States is, it will not be able to simultaneously plan for both the Pacific and the Atlantic and make people respect American interests. This is what Japan knows. Republican Senator Vandenberg once predicted in July of last year that the Far Eastern problem could not be resolved without the participation of European countries. This is a very insightful statement. Its penetration may not be what he originally intended," he said. (30th dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Reviews US-Japan Relations; Pittman Strongly Advocates That Embargoes are Necessary</h3>
<p>Washington: The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to review US-Japan relations tomorrow, and study the steps to be taken in the future. If necessary, Secretary of State Hull will be invited to attend a report, or to conduct an investigation into the general relations between the United States and Japan. The chairman of the committee, Pittman, recently issued a statement to the press, saying, "In view of the current situation, I firmly believe that it is still necessary to impose various restrictions on Japan in terms of commerce, so as to prompt Japan to adopt a more accommodating attitude towards the interests of various countries in China." As for the views of the State Department on this matter, they have not been revealed so far. However, political figures believe that if Congress can pass a bill authorizing the State Department to impose economic sanctions on Japan when necessary, it will be welcomed by the department. As far as the attitudes of the members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee are concerned, in addition to Pittman and other members who have always advocated sanctions against Japan, isolationists Vandenberg, Nye, and Wagner still oppose dealing with Japan with strong measures. (30th dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull declared that the issue of implementing an export ban against Japan is currently being carefully considered, and a decision will be made only after a detailed study of all possible reactions. He also said that he does not intend to attend the report when the Senate Foreign Relations Committee meets tomorrow to discuss the embargo issue, because he has already informally notified the committee of his views. (30th dispatch from Haitong)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma today, if the United States implements the export embargo against Japan advocated by Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the Japanese people will inevitably regard it as an insult to Japan. Suma told American reporters that Japan believes that the current untreatied state between Japan and the United States is extremely inappropriate. If the United States implements an embargo against Japan at this time, it will inevitably give Japan a bad impression, because Japan's attitude towards the United States has not changed since the expiration of the US-Japan Treaty, and it has strived to adjust relations between the two countries. As for the opening of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers, both the Tokyo side and the local authorities are doing their best to realize it as soon as possible. (31st dispatch from United Press)</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Reopens Today; Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Finance Minister Will Deliver Speeches</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The 75th Japanese Parliament is scheduled to reopen tomorrow to begin its questioning and debate. The Japanese government has already reached a consensus on measures to deal with domestic economic issues, and Prime Minister Yonai's general policy direction, Finance Minister Sakurai's financial policy direction, and Foreign Minister Arita's diplomatic policy speech have all been officially decided and completed preparations for attending the parliament. Therefore, at the temporary cabinet meeting this morning and the government official meeting this afternoon, discussions were held on the government's final parliamentary session. On the other hand, in terms of political parties, starting with the general meetings of the Seiyukai and Minseito factions on the 30th, the Minseito Party, the Social Democratic Party, the Shiokyoku Doshikai, etc. will convene party meetings on the 31st to decide on the basic attitude of the current resolution meeting, which is stacked with important bills, and complete various preparations. Thus, at the reopening of the parliament on the 1st, the House of Peers will hold a formal meeting at 10:00 a.m., with Prime Minister Yonai's policy speech, Foreign Minister Arita's diplomatic speech, and a report on the Asama Maru incident, as well as reports on the decisive battles by the Army and Navy ministers. After that, it will enter a general questioning battle. Ohkouchi Masaru, a member of the Kenkyukai, will take the stage again. Furthermore, the House of Representatives will convene a formal meeting from 1:00 p.m., and after the speeches by the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Finance Minister Sakurai's financial speech and reports on the war situation by the two military ministers will follow, followed by general questioning. The first person to take the stage will be Ogawa Gintaro from the Minseito Party. (31st dispatch from Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Disputes Between Britain and Japan Willing to Seek Friendly Resolution; Legal Principles Can Be Disregarded; Expression of Prime Minister Chamberlain</h3>
<p>London: In a speech by Prime Minister Chamberlain, there was a passage involving Japan that said, "Our country has had a dispute with the neutral and friendly Japanese government (referring to the Asama Maru case). From the perspective of pure international law, the two governments may have different interpretations, but the life of the nation and the psychology of mankind are by no means the most powerful factors in legal issues. If the Japanese people or the Japanese government think that our country deliberately and arbitrarily exercises the rights of a belligerent, disregarding international courtesy and the Japanese nation, then nothing could make us more melancholy. It must be known that our strong enemies have no scruples, and in order to dispel their plans, we have to implement all kinds of things, but we are willing to get along peacefully with friendly countries and will never take any measures to offend the self-esteem of this friendly country," he said. (31st dispatch from Havas)</p>
<h3>Asama Maru Case Continued Talks Between Britain and Japan; Britain Willing to Concede to Japan; Promises a Political Solution</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma today, British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita discussed the "Asama Maru" incident for an hour today, and will meet again tomorrow. He also said that Arita insisted during yesterday's meeting that the British side must return the 21 German sailors who were detained. Japan will issue a note again regarding the British government's reply, which can be issued within two days. After this note is issued, all notes exchanged between Britain and Japan will be published in Tokyo and London. (30th dispatch from United Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo "Asahi Shimbun" said that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie, in a meeting with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday, temporarily shelved the law and adopted a political solution to the "Asama Maru" case. The British ambassador stated to Arita that this unfortunate incident could be resolved through friendly negotiations. If it is found that the arrested Germans are not qualified to be detained, the British government will be willing to reconsider the matter. Although the British government has now adopted a more moderate attitude, the points of contention between the two governments are still clearly different. It is expected that the talks in the next few days will reveal the most important effort to resolve this case. Dagu "Mainichi Shimbun" said that Britain's interpretation of international law regarding the "Asama Maru" case simply ignores Japan's superior position in the Far Eastern seas. According to the correct interpretation of international law, disrespect for the Japanese Navy in the Far Eastern seas should be regarded as illegal. (31st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>London: Japanese Ambassador to Britain Shigemitsu visited the British Foreign Office at 3:00 p.m. on the 30th and held discussions with British Foreign Minister Halifax regarding the Asama Maru incident. The content of the meeting was kept unanimously silent by both Britain and Japan, but it is generally believed that this resolution meeting was held because at a time when news of Japanese warships searching British ships in Hong Kong and Fuzhou or the Japanese side strengthening the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, the relations between Britain and Japan have reversed again, there are concerns that the Asama Maru incident will become more difficult to resolve. Therefore, although Ambassador Shigemitsu did not receive instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, he pointed out the urgency of resolving the incident to Foreign Minister Halifax from the side, arousing the attention of the British side, and the governments of Britain and Japan both agreed not to publish the content, which is enough to show that both sides are earnestly seeking a solution to the incident. The British government also has a full willingness to cooperate, so the resolution is by no means too difficult, and will continue to negotiate in the future.

<h3>Soviet-Japanese-Mongolian "Manchukuo" Boundary Survey Conference Ends Without Results; Progress in Soviet-Japanese Commercial Negotiations</h3>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters this morning that the Joint Boundary Survey Committee of Japan, "Manchukuo", Mongolia and the Soviet Union has been dissolved. Regarding this matter, the official side has received a telegram from Harbin that the reason for the dissolution of the committee is that it was unable to reach a compromise. Before the dissolution, all representatives jointly signed a statement declaring the fact that the above reasons could only stop the progress. It is noted that the Harbin Conference was convened on January 7, following the Chita preparatory meeting, with the aim of clearly demarcating the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border in the Nomonhan area. (31st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters this morning that the Japanese and Soviet delegations met in Moscow on January 26 to discuss the proposed bilateral commercial treaty for five hours. The delegations of the two countries are currently discussing the draft of the treaty item by item. (31st dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<h3>America Builds New Aircraft Carrier, Suffers Another Mishap, Suspect Possible Sabotage, Authorities Conducting Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Boston. The new American aircraft carrier "Wasp" suffered a mishap yesterday in the naval shipyard at Quincy Port, Massachusetts, but the fire was quickly extinguished, resulting in limited losses. The total cost of building the ship is approximately 30 million US dollars. Yesterday's mishap was the first of its kind. Authorities have launched an investigation to determine if it was caused by sabotage. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Japan Reduces Electricity Supply, Industry Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>Tokyo. According to news from here today, Japan is facing a shortage of coal. Simultaneously, due to the inability to reduce the electricity needed for armaments factories, the government will invoke the Mobilization Law to drastically reduce the electricity supply to ordinary factories. In Osaka, the electricity supply to ordinary factories will be reduced by 35% starting from February 10th, and by 20% after February 20th. Further notifications will be issued later. It is reported that the 20% reduction measure is applicable nationwide. (United Press dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Is There a Possibility of the European War Shifting to the Near East?</h3>
<p>Since the European war entered a stalemate on the Western Front, general observers have speculated that Germany will launch a frontal assault on the Maginot Line with the arrival of spring, or that Germany will invade the neutrality of Holland and Belgium and attack France from the flank, or that Germany will adopt a grand strategic detour and attack the Balkans. Each of these observations has its own basis, but in fact, only one observation can prove to be correct. We do not ask which observation coincides with the facts, but the general view is that the strategy of Britain and France is to implement a long-term blockade, preparing to force Germany to submit economically. Such a view is certainly largely correct, but whether the future war situation will develop in this way remains to be proven by facts. Comparing the economic and geographical environments of both sides, Germany is indeed only advantageous in offense and not in defense; and in the offensive strategy, there is only one route of attack towards the Balkans that has a better chance of winning by surprise, which seems to be a cost-effective plan. This is because the Maginot Line is where the main force of Britain and France is concentrated. Although the military strength of Holland and Belgium is not as strong as Germany, due to historical lessons, they have at least undergone several months of defensive deployment. Furthermore, they are not far from Britain and France, making it very easy to obtain assistance. Therefore, when Germany attacks, it will inevitably sacrifice greatly and have difficulty succeeding. As for developing towards the Balkans, the situation is different. The military strength of countries such as Romania and Bulgaria is certainly insufficient to resist Germany; and the assistance of Britain and France is beyond their reach. This strategy is relatively easy; moreover, the countries in the Balkans are small and divided in strength, and their wishes are great and mixed. In the event of a crisis, each will prioritize its own interests, so there is the greatest possibility of being defeated individually.</p>
<p>From a flat military perspective, changes in the Balkan situation, the rise and fall of power, are not the determining factors in the victory or defeat of the European war; but a flat observation is not enough. Since Germany has the greatest possibility of attacking the Balkans, the Near Eastern countries neighboring the Balkans have recently been filled with an atmosphere of gunpowder. According to dispatches from various places, it is rumored that Germany is about to expand its military operations to the Caucasus, Iraq, Iran, and the Arabian region; it is rumored that Britain and France have also amassed large armies in various parts of the Near East, preparing to cope with future incidents; there are even rumors that Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Turkey intend to conclude a military alliance immediately, and that Iranian troops have already begun mobilization. In short, the recent situation can be said to have reached a considerable degree of tension. The Near East is closely related to the future of the war for Britain and France. In economic terms, most of the kerosene needed by Britain is obtained from Iran and Iraq; and the wheat and cotton of Iraq are the main food and raw materials supplied to Britain. In military terms, the Suez Canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, is completely controlled by Palestine in the Near East; and Syria and Iraq are the two most important military strongholds in the Near East. If the British and French forces in the Near East suffer setbacks, there will be major difficulties in the contact between Britain and France and Asia; military activities will also be reduced; and the colonies in Africa will also be in danger of being threatened and attacked.</p>
<p>Because the Near East is so important, all the European warring countries attach great importance to this military and economic stronghold. However, the situation in the Near East is very complex. It is difficult to foresee what changes will occur in the Near East in the near future, or what kind of reaction the Near East will have due to coercion and inducement. If Germany wants to attack this stronghold, it depends on how strong the combination of Germany and the Soviet Union is. The Soviet Union believes that Germany's attack on the Balkans directly affects the westward expansion of Soviet power; if it goes further into the Near East, it will lead to a more acute confrontation with the Soviet Union's power. In the overall strategy of the Soviet Union, it would not be convenient to allow Germany to realize this plan. A more likely possibility is that Germany will use the Soviet Union's power to develop towards the Near East to indirectly complete its strategy.</p>
<p>Since the revolution, the Soviet Union has always adopted the diplomatic banner of supporting small and weak nations and liberating oppressed nations towards the Near Eastern countries; in fact, it did help Turkey to restore its country, and successively made friends with Afghanistan, Iran, and other countries, inducing them to lean towards the Soviet Union. Since the outbreak of the European war, the Soviet Union has been more active in the Near East. Although the past Soviet-Turkish negotiations were not successful, the good friendship between the two countries still exists. Recently, the Soviet Union announced the construction of railways on the Iranian border, completing the connection between the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea, which is obviously a plan for the Near East. Originally, the Soviet Union had strong military power and geographical advantages. The reason why it was not in a hurry to take action was that the opportunity was not ripe and the pretext was not very clever. If Britain and France were to create an opportunity for it and give it a pretext, such as actively assisting Finland, the Soviet Union would be afraid that it would have to take action in the Near East.</p>
<p>Although Britain and France have close military and economic reliance on the Near East, the interior of the Near East has never been sincerely convinced by Britain and France; the riots in Palestine last year are an example. Originally, after the end of the First World War, the Near East was divided by Britain, France, and other countries in the form of mandates; although a small part of it has since declared independence, it is still actually subject to the control and manipulation of Britain and France; especially all economic resources are mostly occupied by Britain and France. In recent years, many ethnic groups in the Near East have hoped to obtain true freedom and independence. If there is an opportunity to take advantage of, they will have serious expressions that are unfavorable to Britain and France; moreover, in the vicinity of the Near East, in addition to the Soviet Union, which is eyeing it covetously, Italy is unwilling to sit idly by and watch the rise and fall of power, and Japan also hopes to get involved. Whether Britain and France can maintain the Near East and utilize it in the future will depend on whether Britain and France can first solve these political problems. Otherwise, if Germany and the Soviet Union jointly attack this weak point, who can guarantee that the center of gravity of the European situation will not shift in this direction? If the flames of war are ignited in the Near East, then what Germany and the Soviet Union seek will not be obtained, and Japan will inevitably see it as an opportunity to take advantage of the fire, looting Britain and France's colonies in Asia on the one hand, and intensifying the oppression of Britain and France's rights and interests in China on the other. This will only aggravate the situation!</p>

<h3>Commemoration of the Nazi Party's Rule, Hitler Reaffirms the German Nation's Right to Exist, Ridicules Britain and France's So-Called War Goals, Expresses Belief in Germany's Final Victory</h3>
<p>Berlin. Yesterday was the seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. A commemorative meeting was held at the Berlin Sports Palace at 8 p.m. The meeting was only announced provisionally yesterday afternoon. Before 8 p.m., the entire venue was crowded, with 15,000 audience members from all walks of life. All cabinet members, generals, and party and government leaders were also present. When the Führer Hitler arrived, the entire venue erupted in thunderous cheers that lasted for several minutes. Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Führer Hitler delivered speeches successively. After the speeches, the entire venue sang anti-British military songs and the meeting adjourned. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The main points of Führer Hitler's speech at the Berlin Sports Palace last night, on the seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, are as follows: (1) Briefly described the failures of the democratic Germany to improve the situation from the Treaty of Versailles to the time when the Nazi Party came to power in 1933. (2) Listed the achievements of the Nazi Party's eight years in power: Germany began large-scale military expansion in 1934, implemented universal conscription in 1935, occupied the Rhineland region in 1936, implemented the four-year plan in 1937, annexed Austria and the Sudetenland region in 1938, and rose up to defend itself in 1939 when the enemy's mask was uncovered. (3) Discussed the war aims of Britain and France, saying that in a nutshell, "they want to restore a fragmented Germany like in 1648." (4) Briefly mentioned German-Italian relations, declaring that the friendship between the two countries remains as before and their interests are the same. (5) Responded to Britain and France, hoping that the opinions within Germany were complex, and especially warned the French Premier, "Mr. Daladier, if you think you are fighting against German tribes, you are either foolish or delusional. I clearly inform you that the tribes in your mind are actually a united Nazi German nation." (6) Finally, Mr. Xi (Hitler) vigorously affirmed the right to exist of the 80 million German nation, stressing that "if there is no clear understanding of rights, then understanding is out of the question. We do not want to fight for another three to five years. The German people have placed their trust in me, and I will strive to repay them and live up to their expectations." (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Danjing. Today is the seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's coming to power in Germany. The commemorative ceremony began at 7 p.m. this afternoon at the Berlin Sports Palace. First, Goebbels delivered a brief opening speech, stating that the Western plutocratic political countries are still spreading rumors, and their goal is to divide the German nation, but this kind of trick "is indeed" worthless. Under the leadership of the Führer, the German nation has already united and will never be confused by the words of London and Paris, but will only follow the teachings of the leader. On this seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, I would like to thank the leader on behalf of the people of the whole country. In the future, the people of the whole country should repay the leader's great achievements with struggle and work. Hitler then took the stage to deliver a speech at 7:03 p.m., which lasted for 63 minutes until 8:06 p.m. Briefly stated that the British war goal is to build a so-called new Europe. The authorities of that country promise to establish justice, implement disarmament, guarantee free trade, cultural prosperity and religious life after the war. It's "pathetic" that they can't come up with new slogans. Because in 1918, they also used the establishment of a new Europe as their war goal, but in practice, apart from disarming and destroying some countries, they themselves re-expanded their military. That's all. All the ills after the last European war were caused by the Treaty of Versailles. Although the League of Nations guaranteed this treaty, the League of Nations was not a free international group, but a tool to guarantee the implementation of this written order (referring to the Treaty of Versailles). At that time, Germany was still in a democratic political system, and no one cared about the pain it suffered. As a result, Nazism emerged. Moreover, the policies promoted by our party are based on our own strength, that is, work knowledge and the productivity of our country's land. We never threaten others. It can be seen that the movement carried out by our party is purely a domestic issue in Germany... As a result of our party's efforts, our country withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934 and reorganized its military, restored compulsory military service in 1935, sent troops to occupy the Rhineland region in 1936, and annexed Austria and the Sudetenland region in 1938. Until last year, we finally uncovered the enemy's mask. This is the achievement of our party's seven years in power. If all countries could have understood the German nation at the beginning, then everything would have been completely different. However, in these years, others have always criticized us for refusing to negotiate. In fact, every time we mentioned the colonial issue, others did not even bother to answer. The purpose of the British Prime Minister Chamberlain was to dismember Germany and eliminate the Germanic nation. I don't know that the 80 million Germans in Central Europe also enjoy the right to exist. These 80 million people are strong when united and weak when divided. This has been deeply understood by compatriots across the country. Britain does not want to see a unified Italy, let alone a unified Germany. The current problem is that several young countries have become great powers after uniting with each other and have officially put forward their demands, but the rich countries still want to be beyond their own power and impose a blockade...?? Remembering when the Nazi Party began to fight for the country, others attempted to dissolve our party, but our party not only stood still, but also established a new order in Germany. Today, others want to dissolve Germany. This is the war goal of Britain and France. However, our answer has always been the same, and we can only smash their delusions with facts. In the past, I was always ready to reach a compromise with other countries, but after the Munich Agreement was signed, Chamberlain decided not to conclude a new agreement with Germany. Until September of last year, the Western European countries actually removed their masks and ignored all our efforts to seek compromise, and brazenly declared war on our country. It can be seen that the enemy deliberately started the war. Today, I can tell Britain and France that since you want to challenge, you can now get your wish. Moreover, Germany and Italy have been implementing a common policy for more than a year, and they still do so today, and they will never be alienated by others. Chamberlain once held the Bible and attempted to form an alliance with Father Stalin. Later, because I had joined hands with the Soviet Union first, the two of them broke up. The fact that the vast space in Europe was able to avoid war was all thanks to this. In the past, Germany and the Soviet Union lived in peace for a long time, and today, the two nations have the same goals and will never fail to live in peace. After Germany reached an understanding with the Soviet Union, it has lifted all the shackles in Eastern Europe. The conquest of Poland last year is proof of this. This country was originally guaranteed by Britain, but in just 18 days, it was completely eliminated from the map of Europe. This is the first stage of Germany's liberation, and the second stage has now begun. British Naval Minister Churchill is almost impatient. As for the method of warfare, Britain's implementation of the blockade policy does not care about fighting against women and children, and the method of establishing concentration camps was originally invented by Britain. In short, we have been prepared for any eventuality. Our actions in the past five months have actually surpassed the achievements of the seven years since we came to power. This can be a consolation for the people of the country. Although the British radio station has falsely accused our party of collapsing, this kind of outdated propaganda can only make my belief stronger. The German army is still the strongest army in the world, and the German nation is still united. The enemy's propaganda will never be able to destroy this unity. As for the French Prime Minister Daladier's broadcast yesterday, he criticized Germany for controlling Austria, the Czech Republic, and Poland in the manner of enslaving the residents of various places. I think this gentleman will one day be able to recognize my Austrians. In other words, this gentleman may one day recognize the elite troops composed of Austrians, and then all his fantasies will be shattered. Mr. Daladier should know that he is no longer fighting against several different nations, but against the entire Germanic nation. The army and the party have become one and there is no possibility of division. Twenty-five years ago, the German military was not very strong. At that time, France's strength was above us, and Imperial Russia was its ally, but in terms of the war situation from 1915 to 1918, Germany, with the help of God, was still able to gradually improve its situation. It is a pity that the people of the country gave up halfway and finally signed a peace treaty. However, this kind of thing will never happen again today. The Nazi Party has been fighting hard for fifteen years. Under good organization, 80 million Germans across the country will definitely fight bravely. Any agreement that does not recognize our rights will not be accepted by us. I have the trust of the people of the whole country and will never fail the expectations of my compatriots. We are fighting for the Germanic nation and will rather die than surrender if necessary. I would like to encourage the people of the country together. Long live Germany!"

<p>Explaining the Entry of the War into its Second Stage</p>
<p>Berlin. In addition to publishing the full text of Führer Hitler's speech, the Berlin newspapers also published editorials, emphasizing that Mr. Xi's speech and the emotions of tens of thousands of audience members all demonstrated Germany's belief in victory. The "People's Observer" pointed out that since the beginning of the war, there has been significant progress in military preparations, which is enough to show that this belief has a basis. The "German General Gazette" stated that the Führer's speech has explained Germany's position to the world without ambiguity and explained that the second stage of the war has begun. (Haitong dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>Effectiveness of the British and French Blockade Policy</p>
<p>Paris. The newspapers here have rarely commented on Führer Hitler's speech yesterday. The "Little Parisian" reported that "Since the implementation of the blockade policy by Britain and France, the effect has been extremely great. The German side is very irritable and deeply knows that the risks ahead are increasing day by day. All of this has been clearly demonstrated by Hitler's speech." The "Business News" reported that Hitler is launching a large-scale blackmail campaign, from the North Sea in the north to the Caspian Sea and the Mediterranean Sea in the southeast, all within his scope of activity, and yesterday's speech was a part of this campaign. In any case, Germany has no intention of launching an offensive in the next few months. This is already known to the governments of Britain and France. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>American Political Circles Do Not Attach Importance to It</p>
<p>Washington. Führer Hitler delivered a speech today, vehemently criticizing Britain and France, but the American newspapers and general opinions did not attach importance to it. The published speech was very brief and had a small headline, like a secondary news item. The political circles said that this speech was still the well-known "rustic words" and had no novelty. Its intention was to make the German nation continue to live in illusion. It has no meaning to the United States, because the German nation has always been anesthetized by official propaganda. American public opinion can always obtain correct information on the development of the international situation and can not be concealed by anyone. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>Germany Attempts to Induce Italy to Participate in the War</p>
<p>Paris. French political figures are all indifferent to Führer Hitler's speech today. Observers say that there is little value in commenting, saying that the Nazi Party's "achievements," the promotion of German military power, and the criticism of Britain and France's "provocation" are all the clichés commonly used by the Nazi Party and have long been familiar. However, one point to note is that Hitler tried his best to explain to Italy that its position with Britain and France was the same as that of Germany, and at the same time wanted to make it believe that Britain and France wanted to dismember Italy. This is actually the first step in attempting to induce Italy to get involved in the war. (Havas dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>Fascist Party Sends Congratulations to Germany</p>
<p>Swiss Capital. The German semi-official agency, Deutsche Nachrichtenagentur, recently issued a message stating that today is the seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule. The Secretary-General of the Italian National Fascist Party, Muti, recently sent a telegram to Führer Hitler and Party Representative Hess, stating that all Italian Blackshirt members and I unanimously pay tribute to our comrade in arms and respectfully extend our congratulations to Hitler. Hess immediately sent a telegram of thanks in return. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>Italy Believes It Is of Great Significance</p>
<p>Rome. Political figures here recently commented on Führer Hitler's speech on the seventh anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, and believed that the section involving Germany's preparation for war and military strength was of great significance. They said that the German authorities have been planning the war plan for several months, and that they will probably launch a large-scale offensive in the future. Therefore, Germany's imposition of a full-scale war on Britain and France is imminent. However, some observers attach importance to the section of the speech that criticizes Britain and France, and say that Hitler did not say a word about the future status of Poland, which shows that "Germany only wants to directly annex its occupied territories." As for Hitler's mentioning of Stalin and the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, the Italian people did not approve of it because they adopted an anti-Soviet stance that remained unchanged. On the other hand, Hitler's criticism of the League of Nations and the Treaty of Versailles was welcomed here. In addition, it is natural that the Fascist Party is satisfied with Führer Hitler's statement that Germany and Italy are friendly and have the same interests. (Havas dispatch from the 30th)</p>

<h3>English Coastal Area: German Planes Attack Vessels of Various Nationalities; Several More British Ships Sunk; Danish, Norwegian, and Other Ships Also Reported Lost</h3>
<p>London: Political circles here recently stated that about twenty German aircraft attacked vessels of various nationalities yesterday in British waters, from the sea off Aberdeen in Scotland in the north to the sea off Kent in the south, a total distance of about 800 kilometers. Enemy aircraft were sighted along the entire line. In addition to dropping bombs on merchant ships, the aircraft strafed them with machine guns. As a result, only one ship was hit and caught fire. British destroyers in various locations immediately took to the air to pursue them, and one German bomber was shot down. The German air force, believing that the British climate was too cold for British destroyers to take to the air to intercept them, attempted to act recklessly. However, the air defense authorities had already taken appropriate measures and prepared for them. Not only were the aircraft belonging to the coastal defense constantly patrolling the coastal area, but also the warships escorting merchant ships, equipped with anti-aircraft guns, assisted domestic aircraft in attacking enemy aircraft, thus achieving some success. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>London: The British ship "Penkerris," with a displacement of 4,450 tons, encountered danger yesterday in the sea north of Scotland and immediately sent out a distress signal. A ship rushed to the rescue, and all the crew members were reported safe. In addition, the Scottish ship "Jillarda," with a displacement of 2,178 tons, also sank in the sea off the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland. The sixteen crew members escaped in a lifeboat, but unfortunately, it capsized a quarter of a mile from the coast, and they tragically perished. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>London: The London company ship "Ashton" (1,487 tons), with a crew of eighteen, is feared lost in the North Sea. The ship was sailing to a port on the northern coast and was expected to arrive three days ago, but there has been no trace of it to date. Two lifeboats with the words "London Ashton" have been washed ashore. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>London: After the London company ship "Jesse Queen" (　　〇 tons) sent out a distress signal yesterday, the British Air Force was very active off the east coast of England. Listeners on the radio heard the "Jesse Queen's" distress signal, stating, "This ship is currently under attack by enemy aircraft; another ship has also been attacked." Several British fighters immediately took off and flew over towns on the east coast. It is reported that several Grimbsy company fishing boats were strafed and bombed by German aircraft yesterday, but the fishing boats were not lost. However, the captain of one fishing boat and a crew member were killed by machine gun fire. A German aircraft descended rapidly outside a town on the east coast and attacked a patrol boat. The boat dodged, so although the German aircraft dropped two bombs, splashing water, the boat was not damaged and continued to advance. After British aircraft chased a large, gray German aircraft out to sea, the German aircraft that had attacked the patrol boat reappeared further south, so they gave chase. The German aircraft then disappeared into the clouds to avoid the British aircraft. Two German bombers flew over a town on the east coast of Scotland yesterday, flying so low that one of them almost collided with the spire of a church. Yesterday, another German aircraft was intercepted by a British fighter. The gunner was hit and unable to return fire, so the aircraft flew into the clouds off the coast of Scotland and escaped. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>The Hague: The "News Report" reported that German aircraft attacked the coast of England yesterday, and the British armed ship "Jillarda" of 2,178 tons was destroyed by bombs and sent out a distress signal. "Umtchenni" sustained minor damage. "Barnclerst" was hit by a bomb near Wick, caught fire on the spot, and many crew members perished. (Haitong dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital: The German General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating that our navy has strengthened its defenses in the waters around Heligoland, increased the number of destroyers on the island of Terschelling, and used various other methods to defend against enemy submarine attacks. Our aircraft were actively operating over the North Sea and the British coast, from the Orkney Islands in northern Scotland to the mouth of the Thames River. In addition to reconnaissance, they sank seven armed merchant ships and damaged several others. Two British picket boats were also sunk. Although British anti-aircraft gunners and fighters were very active at the time, only one of our aircraft was missing. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Danish Capital: The Danish Ministry of Commerce announced that, in view of the frequent accidents in North Sea shipping, Danish sailors must have life jackets before boarding ships to prevent accidents. In addition, the government is currently planning other safety measures. (Haitong dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>The Hague: German aircraft were seen flying over the northeastern and central parts of the Netherlands last night. Dutch air force patrols immediately took to the air to chase them away, and anti-aircraft guns also opened fire. It is reported that the Dutch government is planning to negotiate with Berlin about this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>German Troops Launch Attack on French Positions West of the Saar River, but Fail</h3>
<p>Paris: Regarding the situation on the front lines, semi-official sources recently announced that the snow on the front lines had recently melted, but it froze again yesterday. However, German troops were still dispatched, on a larger scale than normal patrol activities, and used artillery fire to cover their advance on our positions between the Saar River and the Warndt Forest. The scattered villages and numerous houses there are not conducive to patrol activities. Since last October, German troops have repeatedly launched sudden attacks in this area, attempting to seize French outposts, but have not succeeded. The reason for this is that when German troops attacked yesterday, French troops immediately opened fire and repelled them. The two sides' artillery then exchanged fire until nightfall. In addition, the air forces of both sides did not engage due to bad weather. However, one German aircraft flew over northern France and returned to Germany via Belgian airspace. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters recently issued War Report No. 296, stating that the vanguard units of our and enemy armies were quite active on the west bank of the Saar River today. The artillery of both sides also exchanged fire throughout the day. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Continued Progress in British Merchant Shipping</h3>
<p>London: An official article published today indicated that the state of British merchant shipping continues to improve, and there has been an upswing in recent weeks. During a period of twenty weeks, the average number of British ships lost each week due to German naval action was 5.2, totaling 23,600 tons, while the number of ships added was 5.4, totaling 24,000 tons. In the week ending January 25, four British ships and fourteen neutral ships were lost, proving the accuracy of Naval Minister Churchill's statement that Germany was venting its anger specifically on neutral ships. The situation of German merchant shipping is very different from that of Britain. When the war broke out, there were 350 German ships sheltering in neutral ports, but 44 of them have already been lost. The Allies have captured 21 of them, totaling 89,000 tons, and the Germans themselves have scuttled 23, totaling 139,236 tons. It is estimated that the German ships that have been captured and scuttled account for 5% of the total, and those still sheltering in neutral ports account for 30% of the total. German propaganda about the losses of the British Navy is inaccurate. The British Admiralty also issued an article today exposing its falsehood, stating that German broadcasts claimed that the British ships "Jersey," "Viscount," and "Mihawk" had all sunk, but in fact, these three ships have not been lost and are still performing their duties. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>British Army, Navy, and Air Force Growing Stronger Daily; Export Trade Also Gradually Improving; Constant Concern for the Interests of Neutral Countries: Chamberlain Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Chamberlain attended a banquet of the "Public Interest Protection Committee" at noon today and delivered a speech, stating that German submarines had not been active for a long time. One submarine attacked a British convoy again yesterday but was eventually destroyed, and most of the crew members were rescued by our side. Our navy has always stood on the front line of defense of the British Isles. In other words, the oceans of the world account for two-thirds of the global area, and British ships are protected by the navy wherever they sail. From the northern coast of Scotland to the coast of Greenland, the sea area spans 1,000 miles. Our navy fleet is constantly patrolling this sea area, and the results are becoming increasingly apparent. The claim by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels that Germany has gained control of the ocean is laughable. German aircraft have recently repeatedly attacked defenseless ships. Although they flee as soon as our anti-aircraft guns or destroyers open fire on them, ships and lives have suffered as a result. However, the strength of the British Navy is sufficient to protect convoys, and more and more neutral ships are taking advantage of our navy's escort arrangements. Our achievements in the naval field are as described above, and we are making great efforts in other areas and have achieved great results, as evidenced by various facts. In terms of the army, our country has more than 1.25 million troops in the mainland, on the French front, in India, in overseas territories, and guarding important transportation routes. Thousands of trucks have been transported to France, and no less than 500,000 tons of various munitions and military supplies have been transported to the front lines. In terms of the air force, the number of workers employed in aircraft factories has increased sevenfold compared to 1935-36, and 67 aviation schools will be established in Canada in the near future, with a total of 40,000 instructors and pilots. More than 80 new or expanded airfields have been built. In addition, in order to ensure the various raw materials needed for our military equipment, a plan has been drawn up to purchase all the wool produced by the various territories of the Empire during the war and for one year after the end of the war. We have also purchased textile raw materials and leather, totaling millions of pounds. The number of cannons of various calibers manufactured has increased at least twofold compared to the past, and some have increased eightfold. The extent of our war effort can be seen from each of the above figures. Regarding commerce, the value of our country's exports did decline significantly at the beginning of the war, which was inevitable, but it has been increasing continuously since last December, and is now higher than the average amount for the three months before the war. Regarding agriculture, the government authorities are currently planning to increase the area of arable land in the country by 2 million acres." Chamberlain then addressed the issue of neutral countries, saying, "We have not questioned the right of neutral countries to participate in the war or avoid getting caught up in the whirlpool. However, regardless of how these countries use their own chosen neutrality, and regardless of their size, strength, or weakness, there is one thing we ask them to consider: in order to exercise our rights as belligerents, we may take certain actions that may cause inconvenience or even loss to these countries. However, we have never sunk neutral ships or sacrificed the lives of neutral people. The enemy, on the other hand, has issued threats to certain neutral countries, which are too weak or too close to Germany to dare to offend them. As a result, Germany blatantly disregards the interests of these countries and does not even consider the most basic rules of humanity. The difference between them and us is vast. It would be wrong to say that we are indifferent to the losses that neutral countries may suffer." (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Hopes for Solidarity Among Balkan Entente Countries; Departs for Yugoslavia Yesterday; Hungary Unwilling to Raise Territorial Demands</h3>
<p>Istanbul: Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu departed for the capital of Yugoslavia today to attend the Permanent Political Council of the Balkan Entente countries. Government officials, as well as the ambassadors of England, France, Poland, and other Balkan Entente countries, were at the station to see him off. German Ambassador Papen did not attend. Before departing, the Foreign Minister told reporters that he hoped that the representatives of the Balkan Entente countries would be able to reach consensus and reaffirm their ties of solidarity at this important meeting, so as to contribute to the peace of the Balkan Peninsula. (Havas, 31st)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Foreign Minister Csáky gave a speech in the Senate yesterday explaining Hungary's foreign policy. Officials are maintaining absolute silence regarding the content of the speech. Political circles recently explained that, with the Permanent Political Council of the Balkan countries about to open, Hungary has not abandoned its territorial demands, but it is unwilling to raise them in the current situation. Therefore, it prefers to keep the content of the Foreign Minister's speech secret for the time being. Hungary's goal is peace, as can be seen from this action. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>German-Southern Economic Committee to Meet Early</h3>
<p>Paris: According to news from the capital of Yugoslavia, the German-Southern Economic Committee, originally scheduled to convene in April or May, is now scheduled to meet in February. According to official explanations, the reason for holding the meeting early is that, after Germany and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia implemented customs unification, there is a need to adjust the commercial relations between Germany and the southern countries. It is generally believed that the convening of this meeting is at the insistence of Germany, and it will be related to the German offensive that has begun in southeastern Europe. A new German financial delegation has arrived in the capital of Yugoslavia to negotiate matters related to the pre-war Serbian loan. The German goal seems to be to increase the percentage of repayment that the Southern country agreed to in December of last year. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Southern Country Capital: The government of Yugoslavia recently ordered a batch of goods from Italy, especially cotton yarn. It has now dispatched a delegation to Rome tomorrow to discuss the delivery of this order. In addition, Pielkmann, an advisor to the German Ministry of Economy, has been sent here and met with Southern Country Commerce Minister Andres today. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>Hungary and Greece Establish Aviation Agreement</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Regarding the opening of air routes between Hungary and Greece, it was recently announced by officials that the two countries have reached an agreement, stipulating that the airmail planes of both parties may fly over each other's territory.

The ship arrived in Shanghai on the 26th. Captain Baden has reported the details to the company, the British Consulate, and the naval authorities.</p>
<p>Dispatch of an Inquiring Nature</p>
<p>It is understood that the British naval authorities in Shanghai have submitted a dispatch to the Japanese side yesterday regarding the search.

<p>Detention Possibly a Retaliatory Measure</p>
<p>As for the reason why the Yong Sheng was detained, it is generally believed that the Japanese side is implementing retaliatory measures due to the Asama Maru incident. When the Japanese military boarded the Yong Sheng, they asked Captain Baden about the Asama Maru. According to other sources, the dispatch sent by the British Navy to the Japanese side yesterday was purely of a specialized nature. As for how the Japanese side will handle this, nothing was heard as of last night.</p>

<h3>Asama Maru Passenger Talks About the Experience of German Captives; British Naval Officers and Soldiers Are All Well-Mannered; Help Germans Carry Out Personal Items</h3>

All German passengers on board were</p>
<p>Taken into a Room</p>
<p>Inside, the British officer went to meet with the captain of the Asama Maru, and after a while, he returned to address the Germans who were to be taken to the British ship, and allowed them to return to the cabin to carry their luggage.

Among the German sailors who were taken out, there was a captain who had previously told people, "During the World War, he</p>
<p>Had Been Detained</p>
<p>In Chile, I expect to be detained again this time on the Asama Maru." As a result, it came true.

Teef will stay in Shanghai for more than a week, and then set off for Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, and then to New Zealand.</p>

<h3>Fire on Julu Road</h3>
<p>At about 9:00 PM on the 26th of last month, a silversmith's shop on the back building of No. 13, Lane 189, Julu Road, in the French Concession caught fire, endangering the left and right neighbors. At that time, Ms. Yu Ling, the second landlord of the house, and the silversmith Han Zhuqing were unable to escape and died in the fire. After the fire brigade extinguished the fire, the two bodies were dug out and taken to the autopsy station. The police reported to the Public Procurator of the Second Special Court to verify that Yu Ling's husband, Yu Gaosheng, had received the body for burial.

The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is learned that the body of Yu Ling, which was dug out after the incident at that time, was actually an apprentice of the dead Han Zhuqing, whose name is unknown.

The family reported to the police station and sent the body to the autopsy station for verification. After reporting to the Second Special Court to send personnel to inspect it today, the family will coffin it.</p>
<h3>Ningbo is Extremely Peaceful: Telegrams to Shanghai from Ning Shao Yesterday; Market Rumors Are Not Credible</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army crossed the Qiantang River by stealth and invaded Xiaoshao, the Chinese army has dispatched a large army to block it. Now the Japanese army that landed is unsustainable and will soon be wiped out. However, yesterday the market rumored again that the Japanese army had landed in Longshan, eastern Zhejiang, and Ningbo was bombed. A New Voice reporter confirmed with relevant parties that it was not true. Yesterday, foreign ships anchored outside the Zhenhai Estuary telegraphed to Shanghai to report the itinerary of each ship. The landing of the Japanese army in Longshan and the bombing of Ningbo were not mentioned, which proves that the rumors are not true. At the same time, the telegram of a certain Italian ship contained the four words "Ningbo is Peaceful." Telegrams from Shaoxing, Yuyao, Ningbo, Zhenhai, and other places yesterday reported that the situation was peaceful. Very few people in the urban area have moved to the countryside, and because the Lunar New Year is approaching, the commercial market is still very prosperous, but the market is held at night. As for the outside world, there is even a saying that the Japanese army has arrived in Ningbo. According to a report from the Datong News Agency to the relevant parties, it is purely unfounded rumors. The Ningbo Tongxiang Association in Shanghai received a telegram from Ningbo yesterday, which briefly stated, "The Xiaoshan war is getting better and better, and the situation in Ningbo is more peaceful than usual." From this, it is enough to infer that the shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is also very smooth. The Moufu Wheel is scheduled to enter the port this morning and sail to Zhenhai on the second day. The Baoli is scheduled to leave Zhen and sail to Shanghai on the same day. However, in addition to passengers, the cargo has decreased sharply. Deping and Dabu have both safely arrived in Zhenhai.</p>

It is heard that the colleagues of the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company, in view of the suffering of the child refugees, specially saved 300 yuan for New Year's Eve dinner and sent it to the academy in a letter yesterday. The academy also hosted leaders of various industries at the Shipping Club at 6:00 PM yesterday. On the spot, leaders of various industries raised donations, totaling more than 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Steel Bar Old Iron Industry Association issued a notice to members yesterday to initiate the saving of New Year's expenses and transfer them to help the "Refugee Children's Educational Academy" to educate and nurture the expenses of child refugees. Thanks to the support of merchants from the Han口铁商德昌祥申莊 and other industries, they first donated 500 yuan to this association to be forwarded to the educational academy. Then, the merchants donated 551 yuan to repay the food expenses of the child refugees. The merchants are so enthusiastic, and it is thought that the members of this association should be more enthusiastic. If you would like to donate, please send the donation to Hongxing Iron Shop, No. 833 South Suzhou Road, for collection and forwarding.</p>
<h3>Three American Youths Arrested and Repatriated</h3>
<p>Three American residents, Mr. Mai Gen, Mr. Yiwenji, and Mr. Qiong Xun, were detained by the Central Police on the evening of January 30.

<h3>Taking Advantage of the Lunar New Year: Rice Merchants Engage in Under-the-Table Transactions; Market Management Committee Strictly Cracks Down; Rice Prices Should Be Controlled Based on Inventory</h3>
<p>The price of rice in the Shanghai bean and rice market has been subject to price limits stipulated by the concession authorities. Speculation and manipulation are prohibited. At the same time, various industries have formed a People's Food Regulation Association to collectively order foreign rice. A Flat Price Committee has been established to solicit donations and manage flat price sales. As a result, the price of rice in the market has stabilized. However, the current market price of rice, especially medium and lower grades, has reached the limit price, and under-the-table transactions have occurred. The highest price for white rice in the unofficial market has risen to around 44 yuan per day, and sales are restricted to those who are well-acquainted. This is actually a deliberate manipulation for profit by general speculators, taking advantage of the period of limited arrivals during the Lunar New Year. It is reported that the Market Management Committee has strictly cracked down. The Shanghai market has a very abundant stock of rice, and foreign rice is arriving continuously, so there is no reason for panic. Based on the inventory, there is no reason for such a sharp rise in prices. Yesterday, the "Ewo Fook Sang" vessel arrived with 4,049 bags of tribute rice, and the "Taikoo Suiyang" vessel arrived with 10,447 bags of tribute rice, both diverted from Hong Kong. The "Yuezhou" vessel also delivered 6,478 bags the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce: Temporarily Issues Certificates of Origin for National Goods; Scope Limited to Safe Areas within the Special Zone; Certificates Shipped with Goods and Not Used Independently</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has approved the "Measures for the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to Temporarily Issue Certificates of Origin for National Goods," which are announced as follows: Article 1. In order to adapt to the Shanghai situation in extraordinary times, and to investigate whether domestic factories with certificates of origin issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs have circumstances as stipulated in Article 13 of the "Regulations on Certificates of Origin for National Goods Issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs," the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has formulated these "Measures for the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to Temporarily Issue Certificates of Origin for National Goods." Article 2. For industrial products manufactured by domestic factories within the Shanghai city area that hold certificates of origin from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and wish to sell them abroad or to other domestic ports, they may apply to this Chamber for certificates of origin in accordance with these measures. The Shanghai</p>
<p>city area's scope</p>
<p>is temporarily limited to the safe areas within the two special zones and will be determined at any time according to the actual situation. Article 3. Industrial products that do not yet have certificates of origin from the Ministry of Economic Affairs may also apply to this Chamber for certificates of origin in accordance with these measures due to the urgency of shipping and sales. However, from the date of obtaining the certificate, they should apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for certificates of origin in accordance with the prescribed procedures within two months. Article 4. The certificate of origin should be attached to each batch of goods shipped and should not be used independently. A certificate of origin should be applied for for each batch of goods sold, and each certificate can only be used once. After use, it should be returned for cancellation. Article 5. If buyers consider it necessary to obtain certification documents for native products or handicrafts sold at home and abroad, the applicant should specify the place of origin or the place of manufacture. After verification by this Chamber, a certificate of origin may also be issued. The above</p>
<p>certification scope</p>
<p>is not limited to the Shanghai city area, but is limited to areas that do not come from the prohibited areas designated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Goods sold at home and abroad through illegal institutions are not certified. Article 6. Industrial and commercial businesses applying for certificates of origin should fill out an application form, stating the matters to be filled in, and submit all relevant documents or receipts. They should be sent to the relevant trade association for responsible certification and then forwarded to this Chamber for review. Factories and shops that have not yet formed a trade association but have joined this Chamber as members may also directly request this Chamber to fill out and issue a certificate of origin in accordance with the preceding paragraph. Factories and shops that have not yet formed a trade association and have not joined this Chamber as members should have a reputable company write to this Chamber for certification and submit the documents required in the first paragraph to this Chamber for filling out and issuing a certificate of origin, but a handling fee will be charged. If, after review, it is deemed that a certificate of origin cannot be issued, the handling fee paid will be refunded in full. The application form will be formulated separately. The application form will be drafted by this Chamber and issued to each association for self-printing and use. Store members and non-members can directly obtain the form from this Chamber and fill it out. Article 7. The</p>
<p>certificate of origin</p>
<p>should include the name of the goods, the quantity sold, the trademark packaging, the special reporter's name, the manufacturer's name, the factory address, the name of the principal, the month and year of production, the place of departure, the place of arrival, the number and issue date of the certificate of origin, and the grade of the national goods. However, when deemed necessary, the source of raw materials and the source of semi-finished products should be included. If the certified item is a native product or handicraft, the manufacturer's name and factory address should be changed to the place of origin and the place of manufacture. When the certificate of origin is used abroad, a translation may be attached. The format of the certificate of origin will be formulated separately. Article 8. Factories applying for certificates of origin should fill out a ten-day production status report every ten days and send it to the trade association. The trade association should compile the ten-day production status report and send it to this Chamber as a reference for signing the certificate.</p>
<p>Production dynamics</p>
<p>The ten-day and monthly reports should include the factory name, factory address, name of the person in charge, name of the product, production capacity, working hours, actual production quantity, sales situation, and other matters to be investigated. Factories without a trade association may send the ten-day report directly to this Chamber for review. The formats of the ten-day and monthly production status reports will be formulated separately. Article 9. Any factory that obtains a certificate of origin by fraudulent means or fails to submit the ten-day report on time, or fails to return the used certificate for cancellation as required, should immediately stop issuing the certificate. If an application certified by a trade association is found to contain false information, or if the trade association fails to submit the monthly report on time, the certification should be deemed invalid. For industrial products that have obtained a certificate of origin in accordance with Article 3, if the certificate of origin has not been applied for from the Ministry of Economic Affairs after the period stipulated in that article, the certificate will not be reissued. If the Ministry of Economic Affairs deems that it does not meet the standards for national goods after review, the original certificate issued will be revoked. Article 10. The certificates of origin issued by this Chamber should be listed and reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record at the end of each month. Article 12. These measures shall be implemented after being submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and the same shall apply to any amendments.</p>
<h3>Chiang Ching-kuo: Currently Residing in Ji'an</h3>
<p>The English "Great American Evening Post" states: Today (29th), the telecommunication reports that where General Chiang Kai-shek's eldest son, Chiang Ching-kuo, is located is a question mark, but this is inaccurate. Since September 1937, Chiang Ching-kuo has been assigned to work in the security team of the Fourth District (southwestern) of Jiangxi, and until recently, he was appointed as the administrative inspector and security commander of the district. He usually stays in the command headquarters near Ji'an. However, his mother recently died during a Japanese air raid, and a funeral was held five weeks ago. Chiang Ching-kuo left the command headquarters to go to Guling Fenghua to attend the funeral. His Soviet-born wife and young son also went with him. Chiang Ching-kuo once studied in the Soviet Union. When he worked in Jiangxi, he helped train new soldiers and shared meals and accommodation with them, which won him the hearts of the people.</p>

<h3>A Bold Thief Waited in the Victim's Home and Forced Him to Sign a Check for Cash; He Escaped with Stolen Cash and Took the Victim's Photo for Extortion; A Dismissed Apprentice Was Suspected and Arrested</h3>
<p>The Meifeng Paint Store at No. 17, Lane 19, Qinghai Road, is owned by Lin Zhiyuan, and his residence is also in the store. At around 9:00 AM on January 29th, six robbers suddenly entered through the back door. Three of the robbers held pistols and monitored everyone in the room. They searched Lin and found a bunch of keys, then opened the drawers of the writing office and took out two checkbooks, forcing Lin Zhiyuan to sign two checks, one for 2,000 yuan from Jin Cheng Bank and one for 3,000 yuan from Shanghai Bank, and stamp them. One robber went out to cash them. The remaining robbers continued to rob in the room. Before long, the robber who went out suddenly reported by phone that the two checks could not be cashed because the seal did not match. The robbers then forced Lin to issue another check for 2,000 yuan from Jin Cheng Bank, along with 3,000 yuan in legal tender and 350 US dollars that had been stolen. They carried the stolen goods and</p>
<p>left through the door. Before escaping, they also took a photo of Lin for extortion, saying that if he reported it to the police, he would be killed. The robbery lasted for two hours. Lin did not dare to speak out after the robbers left. It was not until the day before yesterday that he reported the incident to the Chengdu Road Police Station. Detective Sun Wenxi went to investigate. Hu Zhiming (18 years old), a Ningbo native who had recently been dismissed as an apprentice from the store, was suspected of having informed the robbers. Hu was arrested at Room 55, Donghua Hotel, No. 30, Xiangfen Lane, Nanjing Road. He was taken to the police station and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested detention. Judge Xiao ordered Hu Zhiming to be detained until February 16th for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhanxiong's Case: Sentence Reduced on Appeal</h3>
<p>Chen Zhanxiong, a native of Fenghua, the owner of Anle Palace Dance Hall Restaurant and the manager of Yiwentai Dance Hall on Yuyuan Road, was previously arrested by the French police for smoking opium. He was sentenced to six months in prison by the Second Special District Court, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan a day. While being held in the detention center to detoxify his opium addiction, Chen spent 150 yuan to bribe guards Jiang Nai, Tu Gang, Luo Zhiyi, and fellow prisoners Tao Yongchang, Qin Jiaqi, and Chen Jusheng, asking them to buy smuggled opium, tea, and food. This was discovered by the prison authorities, and evidence was seized. Chen and the above-mentioned individuals were sent to the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court for investigation and prosecution. The two guards, Jiang and Tu, felt guilty and afraid of punishment and abandoned their posts and escaped. An arrest warrant was issued. After the prosecutor concluded the investigation of Chen Zhanxiong and others, he filed a public prosecution on charges of bribery and dereliction of duty. Judge Zhang Minsheng presided over the trial and sentenced Chen Zhanxiong to eight months in prison for bribery and a fine of 500 yuan. Luo Zhiyi was sentenced to three years in prison. Tao Yongchang and Chen Jusheng were each sentenced to four months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of one yuan a day.

The collegial panel concluded the trial and scheduled a date for the verdict. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Acting Judge Chen Daqi, accompanied by Judges Huang and Gu, opened the court to pronounce the verdict.

Chen Zhanxiong's sentence was changed to three months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan a day. Chen Jusheng was acquitted. Qin Jiaqi's appeal was rejected.</p>
<h3>Adultery: Each Sentenced to Four Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Xu Fulong, a native of Huaian, 38 years old this year, lives at No. 47, Boxiang Village, Avenue du Père Hérode, French Concession. He runs a restaurant for a living. He married Jiang (37 years old, nicknamed Thirteen Points, also known as Three Madmen), a native of Yancheng, for ten and four years. However, Xu likes female beauty and has another lover outside. Ms. Jiang sleeps alone and inevitably enters and exits entertainment venues, leading to her acquaintance with Xu Haishan (42 years old this year, resident of No. 462, Xujiahui Road, owner of a truck company), a fellow villager. She cohabits in the truck company. However, Xu Haishan is also a married man. In order to win Ms. Jiang's favor, he specially sent his original wife, Yang, to the Nan City Nine Mou Di Timber Industry Association refugee shelter, subsidizing her with three yuan a month for food. However, good times do not last long. Recently, Xu Haishan laid off a driver in the truck company. The driver held a grudge and secretly reported the adultery between the two to Ms. Jiang's husband, Xu Fulong, who in turn reported it to the French police. On the 29th of last month, detectives were sent to No. 462, Xujiahui Road, to arrest them both and take them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court for trial. Judge Wu presided over the trial. The police prosecuted them for adultery. The court ruled that Xu Haishan, having a spouse, committed adultery with another person, and Xu Jiang, having a spouse, committed adultery with another person, and sentenced them to four months in prison each. The attached civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial.</p>
<h3>International Relief Lottery: Not Yet Approved for Issuance; Police Confiscate and Destroy All Copies</h3>
<p>After the national government stopped issuing aviation lotteries, a French charity lottery took its place. Recently, someone organized an International Relief Lottery Company on the second floor of Jianghai Bank, No. 109 Ningbo Road, intending to issue an International Relief Lottery in the name of commercial interests. However, this organization has not registered with the Italian Consulate and has not obtained permission from the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, so it is difficult to approve its issuance according to law. After investigation, police detectives went to the International Relief Lottery Company on the second floor of Jianghai Bank, No. 109 Ningbo Road, the Huada Printing Office (located at No. 50, Lane 90, Maigen Road), which printed the lottery, and the Dagong Foreign Firm, No. 731 Nanjing Road, and the Tianfulai Lottery Store on Nanjing Road, etc. to search. They confiscated 71,097 printed International Relief Lottery tickets, 150,000 misprinted lottery tickets, 200 wooden seals, 485 advertising papers, and many other printed materials and advertisements, which were all taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, police lawyer Ru Baoyi applied to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court for an appropriate disposition of the confiscated items and explained the facts. Criminal Judge Qian Hongye approved the request and ordered that all confiscated items be destroyed by the police.</p>
<h3>Since the Beginning of Winter, the Climate Has Been Extremely Cold; The Number of Beggars Who Have Frozen to Death Exceeds 2,000; The Sight of Corpses Lying on the Streets is Unbearable; We Urgently Hope That All Sectors Will Donate Funds for Relief</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter in this city, the weather has been extremely cold. The number of beggars and refugees who have frozen to death on the roads of the British and French concessions is</p>
<p>large. Recently, after two more snowfalls, the temperature has dropped sharply, and the number of frozen bodies on the streets has increased even more. The sight of corpses lying on the roadside is unbearable. Yesterday, a reporter from Daguan News inquired with Pushan Villa and Tongren Fuyuan Hall. It was reported that 30 people froze to death in the British Concession yesterday, 17 more than the day before. There were 27 adults in the French Concession, 8 more than the day before, and 40 children, 10 more than the day before. In December, the British Concession collected 406 exposed corpses, and in January, 461. The French Concession collected about 500 large and small exposed corpses in December and about 600 in January. In total, 906 people froze to death in December and 1,100 in January. Therefore, since the beginning of winter, the number of corpses lying on the streets in this city has reached about 2,000. Although some of them died of illness, the majority died of freezing due to the extremely cold weather. The tragic situation is rare in recent years. At a time when the cold wave has not yet receded and the north wind is strong, we sincerely hope that all enthusiastic people will donate generously or save on New Year's expenses to help the beggars on the streets. This would be a great act of merit.</p>

<p>Regarding the dispute between myself and You Huai concerning a promissory note, when I was detained at the Lukouchiwan Police Station on December 22nd of last year, I am grateful that Attorney Xu Wufang, entrusted by a friend, personally came to the police station to investigate and assist in negotiations. This was all due to Attorney Xu's warm-heartedness and traditional values. However, upon reading today's news column in the Shen Bao, the statement "Xu commissioned Attorney Xu Wufang to be present and forced Xu to sign a settlement" suggests that the coercion to sign the promissory note came from Attorney Xu rather than You Huai. This is unclear and confuses the facts. Therefore, I specifically request that your editor publish a correction in the "Letters" column.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Editor, News Column, Shen Bao Newspaper</p>
<p>January 31st</p>

<h3>He Xitang Rescued from Kidnapping, Three Kidnappers Captured</h3>
<p>According to the English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", citing Japanese newspapers, after Chinese He Xitang was kidnapped from his residence at No. 5 North Szechuen Road on the morning of the 29th, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces immediately joined forces with the police to search the Datong Road area, detaining a Taiwanese suspect. After strict interrogation, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces dispatched troops to search a house in Jinghe Village (transliteration) in the Western District at midnight that day, rescuing Mr. He and capturing three kidnappers. Last night (30th), Mr. He was handed over to the Public Concession Police Department, where detectives questioned him. Therefore, Mr. He has not yet returned home, but the three bandits have not yet been handed over to the police department.</p>

<h3>1939 Public Works Department Education Department Report: Three School Buildings Sold Due to Circumstances</h3>
<p>The 1939 Education Department report of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department is as follows:</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, all school buildings established by the Bureau were for emergency purposes. Therefore, each school had to find temporary housing to continue classes. In the previous year, except for four school buildings that had been returned to the Bureau, there were still as many as twelve schools attending classes in temporary school buildings. Last year, no school buildings were returned to the Bureau. The three school buildings that were previously converted into Public Works Department hospitals were not recovered as hoped. The difficulty of reopening the school buildings north of the Suzhou Creek has not been overcome. Most of the temporary school buildings for each school are not very suitable. If this continues for a long time, it will be inappropriate. Three school buildings (the Public School for Western Children, the Hanbury School, and the Public School for Chinese Children) have been sold due to circumstances. Therefore, it is concerning that these schools must continue to teach in temporary school buildings indefinitely.</p>
<p>Since the school affairs of each school are carried out under the above-mentioned circumstances, it is impossible to maintain the past standards in any aspect. Although the staff of each school can be diligent and persevering, the obstacles caused by the disorder of the education system cannot be completely eliminated. Except for those who have returned to their original school buildings, the rest are restricted in terms of curriculum scope and content due to narrow rooms and incomplete equipment.</p>
<p>In the autumn semester of last year, a total of 7,607 students were registered in 16 day schools, of which 1,284 were foreign students and 6,323 were Chinese students. Among the Chinese students, 2,568 received secondary education and 3,755 received primary education. There is not much difference in the number of people compared with the previous year, with only a difference of fourteen people.</p>
<p>The dormitories of the Public School for Western Boys and Girls and the Hanbury School are still renting two houses near Jessfield Road, accommodating 20 boarding boys and 24 girls.</p>
<p>One new development last year is worth mentioning: a fourth night school was added, specializing in young workers. These people have not received basic education, so the courses taught are quite simple. Each night school is affiliated to the Public Works Department Elementary School. As of the end of the year, the total number of students was 1,323.</p>
<p>A comparison table of the number of students in each school of the Public Works Department is listed below, from 1936 to 1939 (autumn semester).</p>
<p>(Tuition and Scholarships) In September of last year, the Bureau, in view of the large increase in expenses required by the above-mentioned schools, considered the issue of increasing tuition fees. It was found that the total education expenses required for the whole year exceeded the amount listed in the budget by 340,000 yuan. If the situation remains unchanged, the expenditure of each Western school in 1940 is estimated to increase by about 43.7% compared with 1938, and the expenditure of each Chinese school will increase by 38.5%. Western schools spend more, so the increased tuition should also be more. It was resolved that each Western school would increase tuition by 25% from November 1st of last year, and each Chinese school would increase tuition by 15% from the spring of this year. The above surcharges are estimated to generate 100,000 yuan per year.</p>
<p>Last year, seven outstanding students in Chinese middle schools obtained scholarships. Together with the 14 freshmen who obtained scholarships for excellent results in the entrance examination held in June, a total of 21 people were invited to waive all tuition and book fees. In addition, there were 31 old students who had won scholarships in the previous year, each of which was extended for one year. As for students in Western schools, depending on their academic performance and family financial situation, four students were exempted from paying all or part of their tuition.</p>
<p>(Schools Receiving Subsidies) Last year, a total of 178 private Chinese schools applied for subsidies, including 35 new schools and 143 old schools. Their applications were reviewed separately by a special sub-committee of the Education Committee. As a result, 147 schools were approved, but with one condition: the facilities of each school must comply with the regulations of each department of the Bureau. A total of 220,000 yuan was approved for distribution in subsidies. The subsidies of 16 schools were cancelled for various reasons.</p>
<p>A total of 190,000 yuan was issued as subsidies to foreign schools, of which 139,000 yuan was allocated to the nine Japanese schools run by the Japanese Residents Association.</p>
<p>A comparison of the amount of subsidies received by each private school is as follows (1931 to 1939):</p>
<h3>The Revival of Education in Western Zhejiang (3)</h3>
<p>The current situation of secondary education in Western Zhejiang is roughly as described above. As for primary school education, each county has also shown a thriving phenomenon. In Anji County, from March to July of the 28th year, in these short four months, 42 primary schools have been restored, with a total of 2,745 students. Xiaofeng currently has five county-run central primary schools, 59 township and private primary schools, 16 short-term primary schools, and three mobile primary schools, with a total of more than 4,000 students. Lin'an currently has four complete primary schools, 103 junior primary schools, nine county-run short-term primary schools, and two mobile schools, with a total of 5,945 students. The above three counties have completely restored the number of schools before the war.</p>
<p>Although the entire territory of Hang County has fallen, it has also followed the advancement of politics and established 19 primary schools in the occupied areas. At the same time, private primary schools in towns such as Tanglou Sandun have come to request registration. Although most of the territory of Yuhang County has already fallen, and what remains are only some poor and remote mountain villages, 38 primary schools have been established this semester, and half of them are located under the sphere of influence of the Japanese. The schools established in the occupied areas of the two counties, because the Japanese often come to harass them, use the shape of private schools to cover up the promotion of wartime education, which is indeed a painstaking effort. After the town of Si'an in Changxing was seized by the Japanese twice, all the houses were burned down. However, with the prosperity of the market and the increase in population after the recovery, two complete primary schools and two junior primary schools have been established under the leadership of District Chief Yan. The number of students has not decreased compared with before the war. It has been widely rumored in recent months that the Japanese intend to invade Si'an, and the Si'an Central Primary School is still safely building new school buildings for the new year, re-establishing the wartime education center in the rubble of broken walls and ruins.</p>
<p>As for other counties in Western Zhejiang, because reporters encountered searches when entering and leaving the war zone, there are no detailed statistics, and the same report cannot be made to readers. However, with the progress of the military and the advancement of politics in Western Zhejiang during the second phase of the War of Resistance, it will definitely be able to quickly restore the education cause in the same way and embark on the road to revival.</p>

<p>The Impact of Male and Female Sexual Life on Health</p>
<p>Men who read this article are guaranteed a long, healthy and peaceful life. Endocrine fluid in the gonads is indeed the source of life for men.</p>
<p>The matter of male and female sexual behavior was once deeply taboo in feudal society. Especially so-called "moralistic gentlemen" considered discussions of male and female issues simply heretical. As a result, when young men and women had to solve sexual problems, they were like blind men riding blind horses - how dangerous!</p>
<p>Sex is a human instinct, as important as diet. Therefore, in civilized society, the examination of knowledge of sexuality has long been increasingly refined and renewed daily. In fact, it is of great and huge benefit to mankind. The world does not know how many men and women are immersed in the sea of suffering, and have therefore been saved!</p>
<p>Humans cannot be supermen, so abstinence is extremely difficult! And the harms of abstinence are generated by righteousness. However, indulgence is by no means appropriate. Researchers of animal scientists want to know more. In the animal world, many animals actually die due to not being able to have intercourse, but there are also those who die due to excessive intercourse! If people cannot control their sexual impulses and lead an appropriate and happy sexual life, its harms are also beyond description. We only need to see men who committed masturbation, nocturnal emission, early marriage, indulgence, and debauchery in their early years... those who have lost endocrine fluid in their gonads will suffer from impotence, incomplete development, back pain, neurasthenia, and brain weakness. Thus, even if there are charming wives and concubines, they cannot lead a happy sexual life. How can this not make wives hate them? From this, the couple turns against each other, performing jealousy, elopement, divorce, suicide and other domestic scandals and tragedies - how can it be counted! Or, in fact, health is lost as a result, life becomes negative, affecting the future of schooling and careers, or in fact, it leads to premature aging and short life!</p>
<p>The above-mentioned pathological conditions caused by gonad loss, due to the progress of new medicine, have the most correct and effective treatment, which is the active taking of "Gonadotrophic Hormone", a healthy reproductive gland of animals. This therapy has been recognized by world-renowned doctors, and no less than several million men have been cured. It is true that this agent is expensive in materials, finely supervised, mild in nature, and has great replenishment power. It is any similar. What any similar preparations cannot match. After taking it, it will produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood in one day and night. Continuous taking will further promote development and nourish the nerves, and it will definitely cure various diseases in a short period of time. Middle-aged and elderly people often take it to prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea must also take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Schmidt's Semen Consolidating Tablets" (sold at major pharmacies such as Sino-Foreign Five Continents, Sino-English Huamei, etc., and the Western Music Department of Wing On Company, with an actual price of two yuan per bottle) to consolidate the sperm gate and stop the leakage, which will be effective faster!</p>
<p>Fitness and Beauty</p>
<h3>The Misfortune of Atrophied Breasts and How to Save Them</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA</p>
<p>A healthy and beautiful woman with rich feelings and a graceful figure not only makes men's hearts flutter and love her endlessly. Even her women look at her because their own development cannot be perfect. They see that other people's bodies are so flexible, their breasts are so towering, and their hips are so plump, and they will feel ashamed of themselves and sigh in admiration. It is not only that, but also healthy and beautiful women with towering breasts and plump hips. Due to the health of the gonads and ovaries and the vigorous metabolism, their temperament is also very gentle, their thoughts are sharp, their muscles are white and tender, and their cheeks are even like being slightly drunk with wine, revealing a charming red. If Ruis is on this pretty face with a pair of curved eyebrows like autumn water, bright eyes, and light dimples, how charming and lovely it is. These women are not only fragrant, sweet, respected, and pursued, but even in the private life between husband and wife, both parties are as close as glue, with particularly strong feelings, forming a happy family and giving birth to smart children. Their happiness will be immeasurable!</p>
<p>But then again. If you have committed chest binding, self-pleasure, vaginal discharge, irregular menstruation, malnutrition, multiple births, abortions, and evil spirits over the years, serious illnesses and other damages in the past, so that the gonads and ovarian functions have been ravaged, affecting metabolism. Then the breasts will not have good development, showing the ugly appearance of atrophy and flatness. Beauty is lost and there are no curves. This kind of woman not only cannot occupy a place in the social arena and be welcomed, but even in the family, she is often disliked by men. Her fate will be very tragic! However, even with such misfortunes today, there is no need to be discouraged, because science is omnipotent. There is now a gonadotropic ovarian endocrine preparation for women called "Gonadotrophic Hormone" that can save them. The ingredients of this agent are ovary hormones extracted from strong animals, and mixed with minerals and plant phosphorus, calcium, iron, vitamins, etc. under scientific management and precision preparation. Therefore, the medicine is very peaceful and the efficacy is very great. If you take it during this winter tonic, it can exert a unique effect. Long-term use can not only regulate menstruation and seed, blacken hair and beautify the face, but also make the atrophied breasts rise up, increasing health and beauty.</p>
<h3>Spermatorrhea is a Waste of Life</h3>
<p>— Sex Disease Specialist Zhan Nianhui</p>
<p>A bowl of porridge, a grain of rice, one should think of where it comes from with difficulty; half a thread of silk, one should always remember the difficulty of obtaining materials; material things, even, should not be wasted, let alone our most sacred and precious life! Our body is like a machine. The machine must be lubricated with oil, and then the functions of each part can be agile. What the functions of our body depend on for lubrication is the endocrine fluid (semen) in the gonads. This type of endocrine gland is a ductless gland, including the pituitary gland, pineal gland, adrenal gland, testicular gland, and many others, which can directly seep into the blood, irrigate the whole body through blood circulation, and nourish the brain, spinal cord, and nerves of the sexual organs, so as to generate various different and complementary functional skills. Therefore, the brain can think, the hands can work, the feet can walk... thus becoming people who are skillful and the spirit of all things. As for the skin, bones, flesh, and blood... these are just like various parts in a machine! Therefore, science can create robots, but cannot create living people. This is where the subtle effect of the endocrine fluid of the gonads and the nerves lies; from this, it can also be known that the endocrine fluid of the gonads is indeed as precious as the source of life. To make it healthy and abundant, then that person must be smart and lively, and have a promising future. If one does not know how to cherish oneself, commits masturbation, indulges in lust, is licentious, or is worried and overworked, thereby damaging the endocrine function of the gonads and loosening the sperm gate, then a terrible case of spermatorrhea will surely erupt. The harm of spermatorrhea is equivalent to wasting life! If treatment is delayed and neglected, then symptoms such as brain weakness and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney weakness and premature ejaculation, and incomplete development will be endless. In this way, the smart will become stupid; the lively will become rigid; the brave will become cowardly. How countless are those in this world whose youth is thus delayed, lose the happiness of life, or even die young?!</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is not an incurable disease. If one can actively take the special medicine "Ximituo's Sperm-Consolidating Pills", one will surely receive the effect of curing the disease as soon as the medicine is taken. This has long been recognized by world-renowned doctors. This medicine truly has the special effects of consolidating the sperm gate and calming the nerves, and after taking it, one can fall asleep and stop spermatorrhea on the same night. However, for those whose spermatorrhea already has the above-mentioned symptoms, it is necessary to also take the strong animal gonad preparation "Reproduction Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. Continuous use will surely cure all symptoms in a short period of time. One will become even healthier. Patients who can personally come to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment can be even more guaranteed a cure.</p>

<h3>Food Grains and National Rice are All Sold at Limited Prices and Exceed Them, Causing Increasing Panic Among the People</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were few due to the approaching end of the major settlement period. There was very little shipped out of Hongkou, and the activities of local stores were also not numerous. However, the sellers' minds were still firm, and the asking prices in the morning were still high, with prices continuing to rise. Currently, there is no proper market for rice prices. Thick and thin japonica rice and early and late indica rice are all sold at 40 yuan, which can still be called a limited price. As a result, various under-the-table deals have emerged, and in reality, they have all exceeded the limited price by several yuan. The rice sold by rice shops at 40 yuan per day is mostly extremely poor quality. The prices of Baiyuan rice, etc., have not fluctuated much. Liyang goods are as high as 40 yuan, and the next best, Tokyo Baiyuan, is 37 yuan and 7 jiao. There is no market for Lu Yangjian.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market saw customers hoarding two warehouses, and prices rose step by step. The selling prices of various godowns were raised again by 3, 4, or 5 jiao. Hoarders both inside and outside the industry were particularly active. In addition to spot goods, repurchase transactions were particularly lively. However, new transactions continued to be made, and new large batches were also agreed upon. Yesterday's statistics showed that Chinese and foreign merchants such as Jianyuan, Dafo, and Heyi sold a total of 3,000 tons of Siamese No. 2 to grain merchants at a price of 49 yuan, 5 jiao, and 7 fen; 1,500 tons of Mili rice at a price of 44 yuan and 9 jiao; 1,500 tons of Saigon No. 2 at a price of 49 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen; 600 tons of small squeezed rice for repurchase at a price of 48 yuan; 200 tons of broken Saigon rice at a price of 38 yuan; Saigon No. 1 specially opened at 41 yuan and 5 jiao, with a general market price of 41 yuan and 2 jiao; Saigon No. 2 at 40 yuan and 3 jiao, with a general market price of 40 yuan; fire-squeezed rice at 40 yuan and 39 yuan and 8 jiao; large-squeezed rice at 37 yuan and 5 jiao, with a general market price of 37 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen; Tokyo Jianjian rice was high at 38 yuan, and the next best was 36 yuan and 7 jiao; rice husks were at 32 yuan, 2 jiao, and 3 fen.

<h3>Repurchased Flour Continues to be Incredibly Expensive, with Green Cannon Car Prices Reaching 12 Yuan and 5 Fen</h3>
<p>Flour is becoming more and more expensive, without end. Although the No. 2 flour factory's market is holding at the original price of 10 yuan, the supply is limited, and the restrictions are becoming more and more severe. Those in need cannot buy any goods and have no choice but to quench their thirst with poison, resorting to repurchased goods. The minds of general holders of goods are becoming increasingly upward, rising another 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous day. The unit price of Green Cannon Car warehouse receipts reached a peak of 12 yuan and 5 fen. The prices of Red and Blue Car warehouse receipts also rose from 11 yuan and 4 jiao to 11 yuan and 5 jiao. The speed of the price increases is truly astonishing. Currently, the repurchased goods on the market are limited, selling less and less, and many are unwilling to lightly dispose of them as the market changes. Therefore, the market is becoming increasingly firm. The total amount of flour sold on this street was less than 5,000 bags, and the trading volume of repurchased goods was only 2,000 to 3,000 bags. A total of 5,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat trading was quite quiet. Currently, the sources are blocked, and the inventory is thin. The minds of those hoarding for the year are firm, and they all plan to sell again at the red opening of the Lunar New Year. Therefore, there were very few sales on the market, and a closing scene has already emerged. Except for a small number directly allocated to factories, Fuxin Factory handled 300 bags of Suzhou wheat at a price of 20 yuan. There were no other transactions heard of.</p>
<p>Among the miscellaneous grains exports, today there are 2,590 bags of beans, 1,800 bags of raw peanuts, and 1,000 pieces of bean cake, all shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Securities, Domestic Debt Market, No Significant Fluctuations, Afternoon Ex-Dividend Calculation, Foreign Stocks See New High Prices Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities gray market was conducted with interest included in the morning and ex-dividend in the afternoon, so the actual prices in both markets did not fluctuate significantly compared to the previous day. Buyers were more enthusiastic in the morning, while sellers were slightly more numerous in the afternoon, so the strength of the bulls was slightly weaker, but the underlying trend was still bullish. Although it is approaching the Lunar New Year, there is still more cash than goods on the market. There are not many days left in the year, and there are quite a few people who are holding inventory over the New Year. Although there is also a need for funds, it doesn't matter much because the money market is loose. Therefore, there will be no significant impact even if there is a small downturn in the future. The market price was high first and then low in the morning with interest included. The market price was calculated ex-dividend in the afternoon, which is also quite equivalent if the current value of the interest coupon is added. There were still more sellers in Lianhe, followed by Yuanfeng and Yueheng. There were more buyers in Runli, Lianyi, and Xinfu, followed by Wanchun, Yongkang, and No. 16. As a result, the market price was not listed as up or down due to the ex-dividend new trading, only the high and low price table is listed below. The total transaction volume was about 700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of the Great China Match Company were traded at a price of 21 yuan.</p>
<p>The stock market of various industrial companies is still strong, and several stocks have seen new high prices again. Some of the most sought-after stocks are being taken profit from. There are buyers for Yesong shares at 280 yuan, returning to the market price on Monday of last week when it issued a dividend of 20 yuan, which can be said to be a unique dynamic. The shares of various trust companies are trending very steadily. Rubber shares are also firm because foreign spot prices have risen. Inglewood shares advanced to 46 yuan and 75 fen. The trend of Huizhong Bank shares is difficult to grasp. The price surged very quickly at the opening, soaring to 3 yuan and 6 jiao, and then a countertrend suddenly rose, falling back 6 jiao and closing at 3 yuan and 1 jiao.</p>
<p>London, 30th dispatch, the listed market prices of various British Far East company stocks today, the market is calm, and the market prices have generally not changed.</p>
<p>London, 30th, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt today, still reported steady, there was no change in the bonds across the board.</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales are Not Weak, the Yarn Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to sell and continues to rise. This is because actual sales are still stable and not weak. The north still has a healthy appetite for coarse yarn. Although the demand for 20s, 30s, and 42s yarn in the south is not very strong, scattered purchases continue unabated. Therefore, people's minds are firm. At the same time, those with spare funds are also taking in inventory again. The market is supported by this and is slowly advancing, but the overseas cotton market is still not escaping its tired situation.</p>
<p>The opening atmosphere for spot yarn in the morning was still enthusiastic. The opening price for 20s Double Horse was 747 yuan. As soon as this price was opened, scalpers rushed to buy, and the floor suddenly tightened. It slowly rose to 752 yuan. Then, news came that the foreign exchange market was flat, and the Guanggang (Guangdong Gang) only traded specified yarn brands and cotton yarn, and did not buy other yarns. The market atmosphere calmed down slightly and retreated one step. Statistics on transactions in half a day totaled 2,395 bales. The market price of 20s Double Horse rose by 3 yuan, and Tiannu (Goddess) rose by 3 yuan. The factory opened 200 bales of 20s Jinbaoxing (Golden Treasure Star) from the Zhongfang Factory at a price of 725 yuan; 200 bales of 10s Jinbaoxing at a price of 565 yuan; Yong'an Factory opened 50 bales of 10s Special Jincheng (Golden City) at a price of 600 yuan; 10 bales of 20s Special Jincheng at a price of 745 yuan. Today, 110 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Haiphong, 10 pieces to Haikou, 25 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 171 pieces to Hong Kong. The amount of purchases made by various gangs is listed below.</p>
<p>Hong Kong 555, same industry 1,830</p>

<h3>US Cotton Export Subsidy, Yesterday Announced Cancellation Again</h3>
<p>Cotton trading has completely stalled. This is because the end of the year is approaching, and people are preparing to close accounts and are not buying or selling. However, there is still demand from Qingdao, so although foreign cotton is flat and weak, people's minds can still be maintained. Today, only one transaction of straw-wrapped cotton was made, with 200 bales purchased by the same industry at a price of 655 yuan. The source of supply from northern Jiangsu was 327 bales of Tonghua cotton. Today, 130 bales of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, opened firmly in the morning. A telegram from Liverpool indicated a sharp rise, which aroused purchases by the same industry. Spot trading also turned active. Subsequently, the government announced the cancellation of the remaining 20 pounds of export subsidies for encouraging the export of US cotton. As a result, people's minds turned quite well. As a result, the price rose by 10 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton rose by 11 rupees including forecasts, Egyptian cotton fell by more than 40 pounds, and Liverpool cotton rose by more than 20 pence.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, yesterday the same industry was quite interested in inquiring about Indian cotton. However, the asking prices were too low, so the number of transactions was not large, but there were still more than a thousand bales. US cotton trading was very quiet. Factories did not take any action on foreign cotton, and neither did Japanese factories. The factory price converted from the US exchange rate of 7 yuan and 75 fen yesterday is as follows.</p>

<h3>The Future of Children</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>Recently, strange and bizarre gossip news seems to be increasing.</p>
<p>For example, the incident of a certain Wang, who used to "make a living by teaching," using his twelve-year-old twin sons to file a lawsuit and beg for alms, resulting in the arrest department prosecuting him for fraud, is a good example.</p>
<p>As someone who has taught, Mr. Wang not only did not properly educate his two growing sons, but instead asked them to kneel on the ground and beg for alms. We dare not say whether this action constitutes the fraud crime charged by the arresting authorities; however, we dare to assert that Mr. Wang deserves the punishment. Because Mr. Wang is destroying the future of his two sons, if the arresting authorities had not discovered it early, the future of two useful children in society would be unimaginable!</p>
<p>Comparing Mr. Wang's actions that endanger society with merely deceiving a few passersby into generously donating money, the depth of his sins is truly immeasurable. Of course, in the current law, there may not yet be crimes such as "destroying the future of children" or "creating social hazards," but we should not neglect this more important aspect under any circumstances.</p>
<p>We hope that in the future society, "children's education" will become a required course for every parent, and there will be explicit legal provisions for the crime of "misleading children." In this way, the innocent children of the future may be able to enjoy a more reasonable education and treatment.</p>

<h3>Impressions of Holland</h3>
<p>— Renren</p>
<p>These past few days, international news has frequently reported on the tense situation on the Dutch border and domestic mobilization, which cannot help but make me recall the tranquility and peace I witnessed in Holland six months ago. I am also concerned about the nearly one thousand overseas Chinese and countless international friends who are enthusiastically working to aid China who remain there.</p>
<p>The natural beauty of the Dutch landscape is quite famous internationally, so many people have praised it as the "park of Northern Europe." The scenery is even more beautiful in the countryside, with crisscrossing clear rivers and marshes, abundant fields, and the distinctive and exquisite Dutch-style houses, low-roofed cottages, and occasional windmills, all of which truly make one feel as if they have entered the realm of a Western fairy tale's "enchanted forest." The Dutch are indeed known for their cleanliness, and their homes, no matter how simple, always have pristine white curtains adorning their windows. Every house is like this, like a uniform for the buildings. Presumably, because most of their houses are built of wood, which is easy to clean, they have to do a major cleaning of their houses every two or three years. During my short stay in Holland, I saw countless Dutch people wearing wooden shoes and climbing on tall ladders, desperately washing and scrubbing roofs and walls. This is indeed a unique Dutch scene.</p>
<p>The Netherlands is a relatively wealthy country, so there are very few extremely poor people, but that does not mean that everyone is well-fed and clothed. In the alleys and streets of Amsterdam, you often see disguised beggars wearing old clothes, playing the violin or accordion, waiting for passersby to give alms. On the benches along the main roads, there are also many unemployed people sitting with their heads down, waiting for government relief. Although education is quite widespread, university education, due to high tuition fees, is limited to the children of the bourgeoisie. Therefore, when I left Holland in mid-August last year, I heard that some university students were brewing a movement to demand lower tuition fees.</p>
<p>Everyone has heard of the Queen of the Netherlands, right? The Netherlands is still a constitutional monarchy. Although conservative forces dominate in parliament, other radical parties can still legally exist, and people have freedom of belief, association, publication, and speech. But it should be noted here that these civil rights only apply to Dutch citizens. As for the political activities of the people from the Dutch East Indies colonies or naturalized Chinese living in the Netherlands, they are strictly monitored and restricted.</p>
<p>Last summer, there were nearly a thousand overseas Chinese scattered throughout the Netherlands, mostly from Guangdong and Qingtian, Zhejiang. Their occupations were either running small businesses or working as laborers on ocean liners. Their lives were certainly quite difficult, but despite this, their donations to the motherland were very enthusiastic. Once, at a charity event for China, I personally saw a Chinese worker take off his gold ring and generously throw it into the donation box, moving everyone in the audience to cheer. Recently, newspapers have also reported news of large numbers of Chinese workers returning to China. Hopefully, the growing new China will not disappoint these sons and daughters returning from afar.</p>

<h3>The Life of the American President</h3>
<p>— Zi'an</p>
<p>President Roosevelt, beloved by all Americans, celebrated his fifty-eighth birthday the day before yesterday. Dance parties were held enthusiastically throughout the country, and the money raised was donated to the "Polio Fund," because Roosevelt had previously suffered from this disease. The following tells us about Roosevelt's daily life. – Editor</p>
<p>Although the President of the United States, Mr. Roosevelt, receives an annual salary of £15,000, his life is actually simple and frugal, no less than that of ordinary people.</p>
<p>He is now in his fifties, but because his daily life, diet, office work, and entertainment are orderly and regular, he is still in very good spirits.</p>
<p>He gets up before eight o'clock every morning, washes up, and then goes to the grooming room to groom himself. After grooming, he has a light breakfast; scrambled eggs and plum jam bread are his favorite morning meal. After breakfast, he starts reading newspapers. He flips through a dozen daily newspapers page by page, which takes about an hour to read. He takes advantage of the twenty or thirty minutes of free time to stroll in front of the corridor. From 10:30 to 12:00, he meets with cabinet members, etc., except on Sundays; he meets with about twenty or thirty people every day. For lunch, he eats only soup, roasted meats (chicken, duck, pigeon, etc.), salad, and coffee, a few simple dishes. In the afternoon, he reads official documents in his office and sometimes summons subordinates to discuss government affairs. After five o'clock, he leaves the office and swims in the White House swimming pool. Regardless of the weather, he spends thirty minutes in the swimming pool every day. Swimming is President Roosevelt's only hobby. Dinner is more substantial, and after dinner, he retires to his study to write or draft speeches. The President's enjoyment of food and clothing is extremely simple and egalitarian.</p>
<p>The White House, the presidential residence of the United States, is magnificent and beautiful. The White House's regular expenses are included in the government budget, which requires about two thousand eight hundred and sixty pounds per year. All expenses for decoration, heating and cooling equipment, water and electricity consumption, and flower garden expenses, housing repairs, etc., are included. The White House has twenty-one bedrooms, one gym, and one swimming pool. Various vases are displayed on the desks and shelves in each room. Every morning, gardeners must cut thousands of beautiful flowers and arrange them in the vases for viewing. The construction cost of the glass flower garden in the White House is worth millions of pounds. The head gardener who manages this glass flower garden is old and has worked in the White House flower garden for many years and has been praised by President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>There are twelve chauffeurs in the White House. The annual expenses for gasoline, lubricants, chauffeur wages, and chauffeur uniforms are also considerable. Chauffeur clothing costs about sixty pounds per person per year. The government specifically allocates an annual fund of five thousand pounds for the President's travel expenses, as well as a special train and a yacht for the President to ride. The President of the United States has the most enjoyable living and travel arrangements.</p>

<p>Thought is a remarkable thing. In today's world, it is humanity's weapon. If thought is not sound, there is a possibility of being conquered by others. If we want to have pure and era-appropriate thought, we should pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>(1) Recognize the spirit of the times and observe society.</p>
<p>(2) Pay attention to human rights and the welfare of the masses.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to self-cultivation.</p>
<p>(4) Pay attention to one's actions and constantly reflect.</p>
<p>(5) Have self-confidence and a strong will.</p>
<p>(6) Carefully choose those whom you believe in and admire.</p>
<p>(7) Judge with an objective attitude and understand matters with associative methods.</p>
<p>(8) Do not emphasize views formed during fantasy, worry, or joy.</p>
<p>(9) Impartially judge the words of others.</p>
<p>(10) Do not casually accept the advice of others, nor absolutely reject the loyalty of others.</p>
<p>(11) Do not ignore small things, nor overemphasize small things.</p>
<p>(12) Read more beneficial books and newspapers.</p>
<p>If we can faithfully fulfill these, at the very least, our thoughts will not become appendages of the thoughts of others.</p>
<h3>Canned Blood Transfusions</h3>
<p>— Sansan</p>
<p>The Saint-Antoine Hospital in France has invented a "canned blood transfusion" method, which involves putting the blood needed by patients in metal cans, which can last for two weeks without spoiling. After the invention of this method, it has been of great help to wounded soldiers at the front lines.</p>
<h3>Talking Points</h3>
<p>— Zhuangsen</p>
<p>A horse's strength is more than six times, but less than seven times, that of an ordinary man.</p>
<p>A kangaroo's long jump will not exceed twenty meters.</p>
<p>An elephant has a very keen sense of smell and can detect a person walking towards it from a distance of one thousand meters.</p>
<p>A spider has a larger appetite than any other animal. If calculated proportionally, a spider's daily food would be equivalent to a person eating thirteen sheep, eleven pigs, two cows, and four tons of flour.</p>
<p>Beetles are the strongest and most powerful creatures, capable of carrying things that weigh 850 times their own weight. Comparing this to a person, they should be able to carry something weighing sixty tons.</p>
<p>A grapeworm can only travel 0.0000000000002 meters per second.</p>
<p>A golden oriole can travel 300 kilometers per hour at an altitude of 2,000 meters, and its range can last for half a day.</p>
<h3>Children's Education</h3>
<p>— Menggu</p>
<p>After the famous American educator Parker finished his speech in Chicago, a lady asked, "How early should I start educating my child?"</p>
<p>Parker asked back, "When is your child due to be born?"</p>
<p>The lady felt strange and said, "Born? My child is already five years old!"</p>
<p>"My God, madam," Parker exclaimed, "hurry back, don't stand here talking to me; you have already lost the most precious five years."</p>

<h3>Movie King Loves China</h3>
<p>— Huazhi</p>
<p>The recently elected Movie King, Mi Gai Luona, is affiliated with MGM and is nineteen years old. Last year, he was among the top alongside Shirley Temple and Deanna Durbin, and this year he is the sole leader, which can be considered fortunate. He comes from a difficult background; his father is a playwright, and he has had a talent for singing and humor since childhood. Mi Gai Luona's style generally imitates Clara Cable and Lionel Barrymore. His successful work is "Jin Yu Man Tang" [likely a translated movie title]. He is currently a basic actor at MGM, with a weekly salary of one thousand US dollars and ten thousand US dollars per film split.</p>
<p>His life is multifaceted; he likes music, art, dance, and sports. There is a swimming pool in his home. He can also play the piano and violin, which complements his singing voice. His lover is Maddie Gallen, the female lead in "Jin Yu Man Tang" and "The Wizard of Oz," and their relationship is very warm. Mi Gai Luona also has a considerable knowledge of Eastern culture. In "Jin Yu Man Tang," he sings, "Good friends, happy today, I will fight fiercely with the bugs of Garoli, and I will also watch the China-Japan chess game war." He tries as much as possible to learn Eastern styles and even studies Chinese. This summer, after filming "Judge Hattai," he may take advantage of his vacation to buy a boat and visit China.</p>
<h3>Talking About "Daughter Country"</h3>
<p>— Shuimo</p>
<p>I can't tell if I like it or hate it, but I have to spend two "New Years" every year. The new New Year has passed, and the old New Year is coming soon. People are planning how to spend it again. The Shanghai Drama and Art Society is also planning what new things to contribute to the new year. According to general speculation, it will always be a historical drama, but in fact, the arrangement of this drama is completely beyond people's expectations. This is a new play by Yu Ling. It is another work centered on women after he wrote "Women's Apartment" and "Flowers Shed Tears." It can be called one of the three "Women" trilogies. However, the style has completely changed. It is about the fantasies of several women who want to become immortals and think about developing. The author uses fantasy expression methods to visualize it on the stage, so all kinds of strange and grotesque forms are expressed on the stage. Techniques that have never been used on the stage are all being tried here. Ships sail in violent winds and raging waves, women sing and dance wildly on the ship, and suddenly immortals appear. Here, women emerge from under the stage and come to the stage. The costumes here, the old ones are Ming Dynasty clothes, and the new ones are almost new clothes from 1950. Strange and magnificent, it's almost like "The Wizard of Oz." But this is a fantasy, and when the fantasy is shattered, what is given to these women is still disappointment. In terms of actors, All Starcast has also been adopted, including Lü Ji, Yang Fan, Xia Xia, Lan Lan, Xiao Feng, Murong Wan'er, Xu Li, etc. When it is performed in the future with musical rhythms and exaggerated comedy forms, it will definitely give people a new impression.</p>
<h3>"Pain" Premieres</h3>
<p>— Traveling Reporter</p>
<p>At the end of the lunar year, the old opera world has the custom of closing the box. The Xindu Theater will also stop performing for three days from the fourth, and on the seventh, Lunar New Year's Eve, it will premiere the play "Pain" as a realistic work exposing all aspects of the old society. The Shanghai opera world has revised social themes with new ideas and premiered them on important holidays, which cannot be said to be a progressive and good phenomenon. The content of "Pain" is to write about the internal and external lives of all levels of society in the metropolis on the lunar New Year's Eve, using objective and critical eyes to make a powerful rendering. Although it is not known what the effect of the performance will be in the future, this is always the path of Shanghai opera artists gradually moving towards awakening and progress.</p>
<h3>Strange Stories of Misplayed Plays (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>At that time, the play was performed for three days and three nights, six acts, and he missed all six acts, without deserving his reputation. (Shaoshan arrived backstage, and within a few minutes, his face was made up, and his costume was also quick. If he sang "Searching the Underworld Mountain" or "Locking the Five Dragons," he would sing the inverted board while fastening buttons and tying belts. After singing, he went on stage, rushing in a laughable manner.) The play was voluntary, and I had no choice; however, missed plays are missed plays, and popular is popular. I heard that Shao Shan is now in Beiping, forming his own troupe, taking the lead alone. I wonder if he can change his habits and not miss plays? Shao Shan's missed plays are not enough to be strange. Now I hear of even stranger stories that are worthy of laughter. A certain young man used to rely on famous female actors, but recently he has not performed often. He looks dispirited. When he joined a certain troupe, he missed several plays. The manager did not punish him but still gave him roles. He became accustomed to it and always arrived about half an hour late for his own play, carrying a baggage man carrying his costume slowly. Since the play was missed, there was no need to put down the costume package, and the servant would carry it back the way he came. Someone told the manager that the package he was carrying was not the costume for the day's play and could be checked. One day, he was again late and missed the play. The manager ordered his master and servant to sit down and rest temporarily. In the meantime, he opened his costume package and saw that it contained tattered clothes, not the costume for the day's play. He asked him why. At first, he did not tell the truth, but then he said bitterly that all his costumes had been pawned and that he was late every day because of this. From then on, the young man had nowhere to join a troupe, and the Liyuan [opera world] spread the story as a joke.</p>
<p>The play historian said that in the past, actors did not dare to miss plays because the law was strict. Recently, discipline has been relaxed, and the strangeness of missing plays is like the above. The young man's missing plays were due to poverty and not striving to improve, which is also pitiful. Jin Shaoshan's missing plays were due to laziness. People tolerated him when he was at his peak, but once his voice fails and his energy declines, people will get tired of him. If he can change his usual habits, wouldn't that be good? Those who eat and neglect their work are in danger, and all actors who love themselves should be respectful and diligent.</p>
