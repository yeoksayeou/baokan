<p>維希　昨夜法國政界人士宣稱、法屬安南之局勢仍極危急、唯一可滿意之點、為日本方面尙不敢採取軍事行動、但因雙方之談判迄未能覓得使雙方滿意之妥協辦法、故形勢依然可慮、據此間所得消息、日本軍事代表團領袖西原少將已離河內、雖非談判中止之謂、惟法國官方對於將來發展頗為担憂云、（二十二日海通社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>英美會同研討遠東局勢</h3>
<p>適當越南局勢因日方誅求無饜而陷於重大危機，美國當局則正在華盛頓與英澳使節進行關於遠東局勢的談話；據美國務卿赫爾日前的表示，雖謂此一談話『除尋常之交換情報外，並無建議之討論』，而日本各方消息所傳，此一談話範圍相當廣泛！經過許多次的會議，諸如越南與荷印，英美與澳洲的聯防等等問題均為研討所及；而且英國已向美國建議，准其利用英國之新加坡軍港。談話收穫如何，目前固艱確悉，但連日日方報紙對英美的竭力抨擊，已足證明此舉對於遠東危局影響的重大。如果日本對法越的壓迫是近來使南太小洋局勢趨於擾攘的主因，則無疑英美此一合作是表示着一個新的安定遠東運動的發軔。</p>
<p>已往遠東之所以由星星之火而勢成燎原，最主要原因無過於有關列强間之缺乏合作。不承認運動的失敗，北京九國會議的一無成就，暴露了列强之於遠東問題，毫無遠見，且不能在一個重大威脅之前稍稍犧牲自已的私利或偏見。九年以來，問題已由局部的東北直擴大到整個南太平洋，戰禍也從亞洲一隅蔓延到歐陸與英倫；但直到兩月以前的越緬兩鉻交涉中間，列强間還是沒有共同應付的跡象可尋。遂致兩鉻被無理封閉了，侵略的威脅却到了整個南太平徉。如果不是抗戰的中國早已深深消耗了侵略者的實力，如果不是敗衂之餘的法越當局還不肯過分屈服於强權，則列强目前所討議的聯防計畫之類，說不定其功效將要打一個很大的折扣，幸而現在列强當局那種觀望的態度，苟安的根性，已因侵略者貪得無饜的慾求逼得無法繼續存在，轉而講求有效的應付對策。這雖然稍嫌遲緩，但亦惟因其過於遲遲，同時也更顯得難能可貴。</p>
<p>然而今日的遠東局勢，種種侵略的冒險已成欲罷不能之勢，並且在準備方面業已佔有先着，絕不是一種示威的姿態或者枝節的對策所能遏止。據傳關於越南問題，美將於昨日午夜之前再提新的抗議，那對於渴望美國助力的越南當局，容或會增加其勇氣與決心；但在法日之問業已成立初步妥協的今日，其是否會發生實際效果，己頗成疑問。何况現在日方對法越的要求，如果不幸實現，則在戰略上，對於新加坡的要塞地位適為一重大打擊，則美艦利用新加坡之舉，其效果已遠不能與一年以前—甚至一月以前相比擬。據聞美國官方刻正考慮英國關於新加坡軍港的建議，並詳細檢討此舉對日果有何種效果，但願這種考慮過程不致拖延到新加坡軍港的軍事價值逐日縮小以後。</p>
<p>不論歐洲戰爭得失如何，英美兩國都不應因歐洲方面的牽掣而放鬆了遠東；尤其是美國，更應該不負全世界擁護正義的人們所期望，毅然把安定遠東與太平洋引為責無旁貸的任務。前此不久，便正是因為列强都過分關懷歐洲事件而忽略了遠東，遠東方面立即如響斯應的發生了越南的事變。但是現在英美雖已從事於合作的談判，即使談判能迅速有所或就，也未必竟能解決遠東問題的全部；因為英美實力雖極强大，但對於遠東的特殊地位和情勢，終不免有鞭長莫及的缺憾。另一方面，今日的中國業已形成安定亞洲的主要動力，而龐大的蘇聯，其於太平洋西岸之舉足重輕，亦正不亞於多瑙河流域或波羅的海，是以此際而言安定遠東，中蘇都是不容忽略的。已往英蘇問的嫌隙，曾經形成英方縱容日本暴行的主因；即在今日，如果日本不和蘇聯獲得相當諒解，亦必不敢從事於孤注一擲的南進。建川使蘇一舉，已足以覘知目前日本外交政策的動向，英美的合作，如果沒有蘇聯參與，適足予日方以縱橫稗闔運用的餘地。在這一點上，抗戰的中國，却正好形成英美利蘇聯在遠東合作的樞紐，而且除却促進中國抗戰勝利而外、任何其他安定遠東的計劃或措置，可謂絕無單獨獲得成功的可能。</p>
<h3>英美會談遠東問題　中蘇將被邀參加　美考慮利用新加坡港日官方表示嚴重關切</h3>
<p>倫敦　星期時報·外交訪員今日稱、目下英·美在華盛頓進行關於太平洋問題之談話、其他對維持太平洋現狀有關係之國家、如中國·蘇聯及荷屬東印度、或將被請參加云、（二十二日國際社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　據權威界人士昨晚消息、英國已向美國海軍建議、准其利用新加坡軍港、此間昨晚相信、英國甚希望美艦隊能利用新加披軍港作為對日之綏衛地帶、而使英國本身得一心一意致力於本國之生死門、美國官員昨晚表示、渠等正將英方此項建議加以審慎之考慮、並詳細檢討此舉對日果有何種效果、外交界人士評及國務院最近與英大使及澳公使之談判時稱、「討論」與「談判」之分界至為微小、據國務卿赫爾所稱、則此項談話乃屬「討論」、而非「談判」、觀察家指出、美國海軍對新加坡軍港一切情形、甚為熟悉、因數年前、美國軍艦曾在該處參加英國之海軍操演也、觀察家昨晚指出、共和黨總統候選人威爾基昨發表之政策、實可促成英·美兩國合用新加坡軍港之用意、威爾基素主張予中國以堅決之援助、租借其他太平洋上之根據地、以保護美國在該方面之權利、威爾基比次政策之聲明、當使行政當局放擔進行關於新加坡之協商、將來不致於大選時發生政治上的不協調、（二十二日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　據提本官方消息、日官方人士對於英·美在太平洋區域內有合作可能之傳說，表示嚴重關切、上項傳說、係由於美國務卿，英大使及澳公使之談話而起、朝日新聞載稱、新加披英海軍根據地之移交美國、將不但表示美國之實際上參加歐戰、且為對於日本控制西太平洋之絕大威脅、日本必須對於英·美之鄢頗有所準備、英·美兩國之合作、現正採取具體之形式、日本須在軍事及外交方面、作應付任何萬一之準備、二十二日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日報稱、東東官塲抱有一種熊度、以為美國海軍可用新加坡軍港便利事將引起世界嚴重擾亂、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<p>東京　日本報紙、今日猛烈攻擊美國或將利用新加坡海軍根據地、以閉塞日本南進程序之可　、「朝日新聞」稱、「日本不能容忍此種趨勢、因此種趨勢有碍日本稱覇於西太平洋也」、「報知新聞」則指摘美國意圖在整糰太平洋上獨立優勢、該報最後警吿云、「美國對因此事而起之各種情形、應負一切之責任」、（二十二日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>菲島已放棄　自動防禦計劃　鑒於弱小國家遭侵害奎松表示願與美合作</h3>
<p>馬尼刺　消息靈通方面稱、菲列濱人擬於一九四六年美國許其完全獨立時、自行保衛安全、防禦侵略之企圖、現已放棄、蓋德國之制勝歐洲弱小國家、已使菲島各領袖相信、該島之安全、非賴</p>
<p>美國保護</p>
<p>不可、第一步傾向菲島共和國陸軍與駐菲美軍合作之步驟、聞已在最近菲總統奎松、美駐菲高級官員賽爾、駐非美陸軍司令格倫浦特上校之會議中決定、而前美陸軍參謀主任及近五年來曾為奎松總統軍事顧問之麥克阿德爾將軍、則未參加會議、麥克阿德爾主張、使菲島於一九四六年後自行防衛僅略之計劃、業已大為刪削、當一九三六年菲島曾採用麥克阿德爾將軍之計劃、擬於一九四六年宣布獨立時、離開美國援助、自行防衛菲島、現菲島已不採取麥克阿德爾計劃中每年</p>
<p>訓練兵士</p>
<p>四萬人之建議、而決定每年僅訓練兵士二萬人、聞奎松已通吿華盛頓、謂菲島政府願完全與美國之國防程序合作、並歡迎美國派遣新　之陸軍至菲島訓練、其總統並表示、關於獨立問題、雖鮮有意見發表、然彼願見一九四六菲島完全獨立之心、迄未改變、菲總統於宣布刪削麥克阿德爾計劃中、謂渠已不再相信經濟能力有限之菲島、足以自行防禦侵略、在麥克阿德爾之計劃下、菲共和國己每年耗費四百五十萬元於軍事準備矣、麥克阿德爾以為、菲島若採用大量之軍事訓練、使人人均成為有力之戰鬥者、則該島之安全、即可由此種全國皆兵制度以保衛之、麥克阿德爾之防禦程序、即係以此種理論為基礎、然自五月間、</p>
<p>納粹侵略</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談（十）（一）　貝當政府的透視</h3>
<p>下面係Christian　Science　Monitor駐歐訪員之報告：</p>
<p>法國本係獨立民治國，勢力强盛，今乃成為武裝解除，土地被佔之戰敗國，廢止民治，代以仿傚法西斯主義與國社主義之新政體。此種驟然的轉變，旣不易明瞭其所以然，則欲說明其將何所適從，更非易事。</p>
<p>然吾人對於法國此種突變，苟能採取相當保留態度，即可察知法國在此危急存亡之秋，其社會政治思想之大勢與主流，究為何如。所獲結論或可有助世人明瞭該國對英對德義態度劇變之故。</p>
<p>法國觀念及其外交政策之改變，祇能以「革命」兩字槪括之。就表面觀之，此種轉變似無顯明根據，實則自有其根源，一若其他革命然。此種根源即法國在政治與社會方面之自覺是也。</p>
<p>法國今此轉變，對英則化友為敵，對德義則樹立類似之政體，兩者雖互為者雖互為因果，實實上應分別視之。法國之仇英，乃其戰敗及其艦隊為英國毀滅之自然反響。在此種情勢之下，法國對英怨恨，並非出人意料，蓋兩大盟國，有一潰敗，其他一國自必惱羞成怒。</p>
<p>抑法國之敗，英政府亦不能不負其咎。緣英國遲遲實行徵兵，致無大批援軍開到法國，即派出之軍隊，戰車等重要配備，亦不足以敵德軍閃電戰。飛機數量之不足尤關重要。凡此皆開戰最初個半月內，英政府抱「照常辦事」政策所誤。</p>
<p>况英法聯盟之基礎，原不甚穩；法人以理智及個人主義為重，英人則性好合羣，側重直覺，兩者過異，不啻南轅北轍。彼此兩國，除巴黎倫敦少數人外，餘均不瞭解對方民族性及其精神。</p>
<p>法兵數萬，自鄧扣克退往英倫，稍作勾留，然後返法，對於英倫新天地及英人和藹可親，招待熱忱，形同手足，皆甚詫異。某法兵曾語記者曰：「英法人民在性格智能兩方，表面上之差異，被人誇張過甚。苟另有大批法人，赴英久居，俾能深切瞭解彼此兩民族間休戚相關之情感，實一佳事也。」</p>
<p>法國方面對英有惡感，乃無容諱言之事實。記者曾晤最後離法之英國婦女一人，該婦僑居法國已廿五年，與法人愛好逾恒。直至遭受不能以言辭形容之驚惶，始狼狽逃出法境。該婦阜追述區時悲慘情形，不以倉惶出走為苦；第念其愛好已久之法國人民，終因婦乃英人而不相容，乃感眞正痛苦。</p>
<p>至以法國改變政體一事而論，若謂法國廢止民治，僅係法軍敗　及本國土地　半被佔而起之表現擾動，實屬大謬。蓋極權主義在法國歷史上原屬根深蒂固，今日之轉變，卽其國家機構中此種從未完全消滅之專制政治傳統性，再度出現是也。</p>
<p>此一事實，可援引法國權威作家薛格弗利之言以為證。薛氏乃史家兼政治經濟學敎授，且公認為研究法國政治特性與社會機構之最高權威。薛氏曾曰：「法蘭西大革命，於發表人權宣言後一百五十年，絕未由法國人民一致接受。此非共和與帝國制問題，實更有深世意義存乎其間。申言之，此乃法國民族是否容納一七八九年精神之問題，而一七八九年者，法國左右兩派之眞正分野也。法國人擁護右派，為數之衆，遠出始料所及。反之，法國人，除工農階級外，純粹擁護民治，完全接受法國革命精神者，為數之少，殊可驚異。」</p>
<p>薛格弗利復解釋曰，法國革命精神之本質，厥在確認主權屬諸全民，政治應從下而上，並非從上而下。此種民治與獨裁制之基本區別，乃法蘭西第三共和國成立六十餘年來政爭之焦點。</p>
<p>法國為政體問題，曾於一八七五年舉行票決，結果僅以一票之勝，決定樹立共和政體。當時王位承繼人苟未堅持沿　王窒旗，反對紅白藍三色革命旗，兩票決結果或有變化，法國今日仍為君主國，亦未可必。</p>
<p>此言當然非法國正退向帝制之謂，然法國民族，在精神上今極混亂，帝制派非全無發　政變之可能。法國自古迄今，始終保有强烈的專制政治之潛在意識，質言之，法國人相信，民衆為自身利益計，應被統治，而不應自治。法國元首貝當上將及閣員中著名者賴代爾副總理輩，旣已聲明法蘭西第三共和　終正寢，今年七月十日該國國民大會所通過之憲法案三件，亦將第三共和所依據之一八七五年憲法，宣告廢止，換言之，已明白承認法國有此專制思想存在矣。（本篇完）</p>

<h3>各界熱望電車恢復　勞資定今晨談判　勞方條件已予自動修改　罷工秩序甚佳並無事故</h3>
<p>公共租界英商上海電車　可全體工人　二十日實行罷工後、界內各路電車、則完全停駛、所恃以維持交通者僅公共汽車與人力車、而在此罷工期內、適値陰雨連朝、市民更感不便、租界當局雖曾派員、向勞資雙方進行調處、冀界內交通、早日恢復、無奈公司認為工友所提臨時解決條件四項、慾望過奢、非得行修改、不能全部接受、並盼全體工人先行復工、使公共交通事業、不致延長中斷日期、一方再從事磋商解決辦法、而在工人方面、則須公司當局承認所提條件後、始允復工、因此雙方僵持不決、差幸罷工秩序尙佳、故未有不幸發生、昨日雖係星期日、公司方面為便利工人代表前往直接談判起見、故仍照常辦公、惟未見工人代表前往、今日雙方或將正式舉行談判、茲將昨所得詳情、分誌於次、</p>
<p>今晨十時開始談判</p>
<p>英商上海是怬公司全體工友、目前日（二十一日）再度集議後、卽決定推派代表四人、於今日（廿三日）上午十時、赴蘇州河路總公司、謁見該公司秘書長包洛克、從事解决工潮之談判、聞資方因罷工期間雙方損失重大、對勞方之直接談判、頗表歡迎、而租界當局及有關各方、亦企勞資雙方於此談判中、獲得圓滿解決、早日恢復界內交通、</p>
<p>勞方條件已稍讓步</p>
<p>茲據大中社記者探悉、今日電車工友代表向資方要求條件之一部、業巳修改如下、（一）每月增加工資十五元、巳減為十三元五角、（卽每日五角减至四角五分）、每日津貼一角及米貼一角五分之辦法取消、（二）不得藉故開除工友、（三）罷工期內、工資照給、（四）勞資互惠條件二十一條、須在二星期內開始談判、據工友方面聲稱、此四項條件為最低限度之要求、冀資方預以接受、俾得早日復工、</p>
<p>罷工原因一般傳說</p>
<p>又據某工友說、該公司總經理以文於四月間離滬赴港時、曾對工友聲稱、米價每石漲至六十元時、每月津貼十元、每年工友不請假者、可得賞金六十元、但此項條件、自以文交流中心　經理離滬後、米價卽逐步飛漲、每石巳超過七十元、而資方並不履行以前諾言、本月二十日、勞方向資方要求答允前所提出之四項條件時、資方僅允發給津貼費一角、及米貼一角半、其餘三項、則完全拒絕、致釀成此次罷工風潮、對社會各界、殊表遺憾、</p>
<h3>公共汽車勞資　今日談判　勞方提先決條件</h3>
<p>英商中國公共汽車公司全部工友、以前次所提改善待遇廿三條、迄未獲得資方圓滿答復、在此生活程度高漲之秋、又受電車工人罷工之剌激、故再度提出要求、幷定今日下午三時、勞資雙方在康腦脫路公司內直接談判、屆時根據廿三條與資方折衝外、並將提出先決條件如下　增加工資五成　每月由公司發給食米一石、作價卅元、發給煤球二担、作價八元等、</p>
<h3>孤軍營糾紛　責任已漸判明　事因誤會而起可望解決　至具體條件仍在商討中</h3>

<p>何德奎再訪謝晋元</p>
<p>昨日下午一時半、工部局副總辦　德奎偕同萬國商團司令亨培上校暨萬國商團白俄隊司令曼恩上校、再度赴膠州路孤軍營、與謝團長會談、約歷四十分鐘、何氏等始辭出、所談結果如何、雖未獲悉、惟衆信對於解決辦法、當有若干進步、又據可靠方面傳出消息、謝團長將一秉中國軍人之嚴正立塲、根據事實經過、幷要求獲得具體之保證、（嗣後不再發生同樣事件）與租界當局及萬國商團負責方面、從事折衝、</p>
<h3>外輪二艘　扣於瀝港　高登輪退票</h3>

<h3>電力公司下月起再增收附加費　電燈計增百分之一九，二一　其他電力百分之七四，八六、</h3>

<h3>貢米源源抵埠　訂米已到者僅一小部分　茍航運不斷可繼續運來</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、越南方面、情勢雖緊張不安、然運滬洋米、仍源源而來、二十日曾有二萬五千袋運到、二十一日又有一萬八千袋運來、皆係西貢米巳悉數起岸、聞諸可靠方面、巳往二月來本市訂購洋米、為數頗巨、近日運到者、僅定貨之一小部份而已、茍上海與海防間航業、不因越南局勢突變而受阻、則此後將續有大量洋米運抵上海、</p>
<p>提倡集購</p>
<p>集團訂購洋米、事屬必要、如得普通推行、滬市存米、必更見充實、目巨戶不與平民在市塲爭購、價格自易回平、集團購米手續、極為簡單、凡各團體機關公司工廠商店行號欲參加訂購洋米者、可到八仙橋靑年會三樓三一一號調節協會、領取申請書、依式塡寫、由負責代表人簽名蓋章送交該會指定之收款機關江西路金城銀行信託部、隨向該行繳納每包國幣四十元之定洋、掣取印收、該會於接受申請書後、一俟積有相當數量、卽查照洋米市價、採購委員採取認為最適宜之方法、委託本埠洋行或逕電外洋訂購、訂購合同由舍逕與簽訂、並於定約之翌日、以價格通知訂購人、一俟裝運到埠、卽通知付款出貨、</p>
<h3>國內郵資加價　滬局今日實行　六時半以前遞局者不加價</h3>
<p>國內郵資加價、業巳定於今日起實行、惟滬局之提早於二十三日起實行、頗引起各界之注意、（按自交通部擬訂增資辦法後、並已呈准行政院核定、定於二十九年十月一日起實行、）新聲社記者為欲更明悉其內中情事起見、爰於昨日分別往訪滬郵局某負責者、據切實表示、本局行政、自華軍西撤後盛傳有審美觀點接收說、但此種僅屬空穴來風、殊無足憑、本局郵務長處理郵務、悉秉政府意旨辦理、查此次增加國內郵資</p>
<p>、係奉昆明總局命令、其令內有云「今到日、立卽實行」、並無規定任何日期、故本局於奉令卽趕辦手續、提早於二十三日起實行、外傳或係誤會、似亦難怪、</p>
<p>投遞時間</p>
<p>國內增加郵資滬市　日起正式實行、市民投遞各項郵件　按照新章貼郵、否則卽作不足郵資論、由各郵局將原件退回補貼、或促其購郵貼足、昨據滬郵局某高級郵員宣稱、凡市民於二十二日下午十時以前於就近信簡或郵局投遞任何信件、若於二十三日六時半以前郵局收得者、卽作二十二日投遞論、凡於一十三日投遞須於六時半以前、否則、須照新章貼郵、</p>

<h3>美對遠東　不再容忍　知空言之無補　決採實際行動</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報昨載著名觀察家伍德海之評論云、日本在越南之行動、及日軍干涉荷屬東印度羣島之可能、終於使美國政府覺悟於對遠東採取放任政策之危險、美政府對日本在東亞之行動、雖屢提抗議、甚至東京置不答復之牒文、堆積如山、但最足重視之姿態、當推美艦隊之集中於太平洋、在過去數月中、美艦隊巳將夏威夷作為根據地、大西洋中荀無意外之危機、使美艦隊之全部或一部、不得不移駐於該處洋面、則美艦隊之總司令部、或將無限期的設駐於珍珠港、</p>
<p>美國空言無益</p>
<p>美艦隊之集中於太平洋、當時會引起日本官塲之騷亂、甚至一時具有抑制之勢力、但今則司空見慣、就目前之情形觀之、對於最近日本向「大東亞」擴展新秩序之計畫、巳不複產生多大之影響、去年美政府若接受英國之提議、用星加坡海軍根據地、而遣派一部　艦於該地、以壯聲勢、則情勢當不可同日而語矣、美政府雖激烈抗議封鎖滇鐵路及滇緬公路封自由中國之貨物運輸、但當英法向華盛頓試探美國對日本所提要求之反應時、美國之態度、並無切實之表示、</p>
<p>最近方吿覺醒</p>
<p>一部份美國報紙、不顧英法兩國有事於歐洲之苦衷、任　指摘兩國在遠東採取所謂慕尼黑綏靖政策、其實滇越鐵路、與滇緬公路所供給之運輸便利、得益者幾全為美國之貿易、然則美國報紙之意、　乎英法理應冒　日之衝突之險、以保證美國貨物之繼續流入自由中國、而同時癥狀國本身則不負支持英法之任何責任、過去數日之華盛頓電訊、顯示美政府已覺悟其「精神上」態度之危險、</p>
<p>從事實際討論</p>
<p>據稱、國務卿赫爾·英駐美大使洛齊安勛爵·及凱賽·對於保護英美澳在太平洋之利益問題已有久長之討論、並舊事重提、擬將星加坡海軍根據地種種設備、置於美艦隊之支配下、談話之範　圍、似佔及英美澳與有關係之全部問題包括越南之局勢、荷印地位、及滇緬公路禁運三月滿期後之問題</p>
<p>採取聯合行動</p>
<p>就美國方面論之、其中　中　重要者、當然為荷屬東印度之地位、美國商人向由荷印購入大　錫與橡皮、以及其他商品而新近日本所提之建議、謂荷印如欲繼續此項貿易、須無限制對日本輸出煤油、廢鐵鋼棉花與菓肉、意卽日本擬欲全部統制荷印之輸出、自必引起美國之深恨、美國之一般現實主義者、至今似巳覺悟徒托空言之抗議而無實際行動以繼之、於美國無所裨益、由於華盛頓談話之結果、英美澳對於越南被侵與荷印被干涉之企圖、以巳有採取聯合行動之可能矣、</p>

<h3>戰爭時期中　倫敦報紙的透視</h3>
<p>英國人向來尊重言論自由、卽在戰時，除若干消息，因與軍事有關，必須受政府監督之外，其餘還是保持着言論界一貫的精神，這和獨裁的德國，就有些不同。德國政府統制着報紙刊物，然而倫敦很多的日報，牠們雖不儘是私人所有，我牠們中間固然不免有很多擁護着政府的政策，但沒有一家和政府發生業務關係。關於倫敦各日報的情形，簡短產迻述如次：</p>
<p>在倫敦最老最有歷史的報，是泰晤士。說也奇怪，牠却銷路最小的報紙，每日銷二十萬上下，讀者雖少，凡有勢力的人，却都在內，這報紙的力量，不靠在讀者的人數，而靠着讀者的身份。</p>
<p>每日電訊是倫敦第二個大報，三年以前和倫敦晨報合併，創辦人是甘洛斯貴族，也是合組印刷局的股東，在全國出版一百種報紙和雜誌。每日電訊現在每日的銷路，大約是八十萬份。</p>
<p>每日雜記是一種小型的報紙。牠的出版公司的主席，是甘洛斯兄弟肯斯萊貴族，他同時也辦了一種星期泰晤士報，還創辦其他各鄕出版的十十種報紙。每日雜記和另一種小型報紙各叫每日日　的，同被目婁婦女閱讀的報紙。牠們印上許多插圖以及聳人聽聞的消息，每日銷路約在一百萬份以上。</p>
<p>新聞記事報，是每日新聞和每日紀事兩報合併而成的。明星晚報銷數有四十五萬份，算是倫敦第二大晚報，和新聞紀事報有聯合的關係。新聞紀事報銷數達一百五十萬份，因為沒有黨派的色彩，所以肯批評政府。</p>
<p>每日郵報是倫敦最反動的報紙，在阿比西尼亞戰爭的時候，牠擁護意大利的侵略。牠擁護過現受監禁的英國法西斯領袖莫斯萊，並且是第一份刊出「希特勒萬歲」的報紙。但現在已丟掉牠親納粹政策，而加入國家的統一行動了。牠銷數有一百五十萬份上下。倫敦消息晚報是倫敦最大的晚報，也是牠姊妹報。</p>
<p>每日快郵在日報中銷數最大，每日約達二百五十萬份。標準晚報是牠的姊妹報。每日快郵銷路廣大的原因，一半是因牠聳人聽聞的新聞，一半也許是靠着送記者的彩品。可是牠的政治見解，頗為獨立。標準晚報時常刊載對於獨裁者們最尖刻譏諷的漫畫，那漫畫的作者，是天才藝術家大衛羅。當初英國政府小心翼翼不敢得罪希特勒莫索里尼的年頭，他從未間斷將這些獨裁者的侵略野心指示給大衆。對於日本，他也從來不客氣。在一九三四年的時候，他便畫了一張漫畫題為「日本之統治」，表示因為英美海軍合作無結果，日本便想統治太平洋。他能在反對空氣中，極端實行言論自由，實在難能可貴。</p>
<p>每日前驅是勞工黨的報紙，銷數有二百萬，過去七年裏，始終維持着這個紀錄。雖然有許多人批評牠有粉紅色彩，但除了共產黨員以外，大多數的工人都讀過這份報紙。</p>
<p>每日工人是共產黨的報紙，開辦時是一小張印刷很壞的報紙，漸漸發展成為六大版。牠銷數小，廣吿更不多，所以不能維持發行下去，可是牠的讀者和黨員，都自由捐助，每月平均有兩千磅之多。編輯部主席是防空學專家何登敎授，他的太太兩年前曾飛到中國，訪問中國婦女。</p>
<p>從每日工人報的情形看來，就可知道在一個民主國家，言論自由，是不受限制的。牠幾乎每天批評政府的政策。對於中國始終表示同情擁護。歐戰初開時，社會上對牠的編輯人不免因為俄德關係，嘖有煩言。但現在牠的主張，却表白淸楚了。牠攻擊納粹，不過對於英國政府，也不算客氣。</p>
<p>英國政府現在為了公共的安全，雖不能讓有害國家或者影響戰局的言論發表，可是對於報章雜誌，人民享有言論的自由權，決不會加以干涉的。（ZY）</p>

<h3>處理游資與打擊投機</h3>
<p>— 孫禮榆</p>
<p>最近上海游　過　，浮動投機市場問，外滙，黃金，外股及其他主要商品，都成爲投機對象。有時猛外　，　囤貸物，非但使正當的商業　其禍禍患，並且直接影響人民的生活，允‘具在外匯猛縮物價飛　之際，雖稍有資產安分守己的人，也多稍事投機，以博微利。投機本身有吸引投機的作用，投機之風盛行以後，全體人民都被迫捲入漩渦，現在整僩上海宛如一大賭塲，不做投機似乎是不識時務，這是可怕的現象，應該一切實糾正的。</p>
<p>上海投機的勃　與經濟狀態的混亂，大家都　為是游資過剩所造成的，因之對於游資攻　甚烈，實際上游資過剩的現象，未必一定造成投機盛行的結果；反之，在通貨價値比較穩定的時候，往往可以藉此機興產業。因爲游資充斥，利息必隨之下降，各種產業在這種低息的好條件下，計算上較前有利，發展也必容易。所以游資本身並非一定是掀風作浪的怪物，倘使運用得法，反而可以獲致良好的效果，關於這點，關心經濟的人大槪都已明瞭。國軍西撤以後，有識者卽大聲疾呼，要求上海游資投資於西　各省，開發富源，造成內地的繁榮；政府也以此爲要務，努力獎勵，施行各種政策，吸引游資內流；然而事與願違，滯滬游資爲數仍巨；其爲患之烈，且甚於昔。因此，我們必須提出幾個問題，就是游資爲什麼聚滙於上海？在上海的游資又爲什麼不務正業而均人於投機之途？有　打擊投機而引導游資內流的方法？</p>
<p>——　游資構成之內容</p>
<p>先就游資聚滙於上海而論，我們可以找出幾點理　：（一）國軍西撤以後，中國富庶之區大多　爲　區，卽米遭兵燹，也多受轟炸，但是上海因爲租界的存在，第三國利益綜錯複雜，而對方又欲利用此塊俎上肥肉，作爲軍需中繼站及商品傾銷市　，乃得維持現狀；內地富家爲保全其財產起見，多挾資來滬作寓公，這是游資流滬的第一補原因。（二）歐洲發生戰事以後，昔日逃資於默洲各國者，也覺外國非安樂土，又復持資回國；而歐戰擴大，荷比淪亡，法國停戰以後，南洋華僑鑒於局勢的不安，也多滙款來滬，甚至逃避於美國的資本，漸察美國有參戰的可能，不敢復以美元爲信用的對象，因而滙款返國者，也不在少。這是游資滙滬的第二種大原因。（三）上海淪為孤島以后，中國政府權力不及，日本也無法統制，於是上海就成為自由市塲，方今統制經濟盛行的時候，欲求自由市塲如上海者，決非容易，紐的雖可與上海相比擬，但因利息低微，租稅苛重，多爲中小資本所忌避，况上海萬商雲集，極富於國際性，所以近鄰各國中小資本為求其活動自由起見，匯款來滬也不稀見。日本方面甚至不得不頒布法令，嚴格限制日圓資金的流通，也足見上海國際資金流動的頻繁，這是游資來滬的第三種原因。（四）中國政府為建設西南經濟及補充內地物資起見，在滬採購貨物，為數甚鉅，此項確數雖無統計可稽，但觀近數月來，寗波，溫州，福州及西南各口岸進口貨値的增加，略可知其大概，據專家估計，本年上半期的在三萬萬圓左右·此項鉅款流入滬市以後，也多形成游資。這是上海游資增加的第四種原因。由於上列各項原因，上海的資金就日積月累，而造　過剩的現象。</p>
<p>但是資金並非毫無流出的。有志的實業家，投資西南各省者，就把資余滙入內地；進口商向外國購買貨物者，也必須以外滙的形態，把資金滙往國外；更有歐洲交戰國人民應徵回國或捐助戰費者，也以其在滬所得滙送本國。單就貿易一項而論，本年上半年上海貿易入超數額卽達一千五百萬鎊之鉅。然而資金流出之數，不及流入者遠甚，所以各銀行的存款累增不已一，據一般估計，今年上半期各行活期存款的增加，當在十萬萬圓以上，與前存者合計，所謂「游資」者共達三十萬萬圓之鉅。</p>
<p>銀行存款的增加，本屬普通現象，但現在名之爲游資，實因其存款性質的變化。過去中國通貨信用卓著，各銀行的存款中，定期存款必占半數以上；現在資金的增加，均為活期存款，因而活期存款在存款總額的比率，已達百分之八十左右，這種存款比　的變更，就潛伏着投機猖獗的禍根。</p>
<p>游資對投資投機之裁定</p>
<p>講到游資不投放於產業的理由，的有幾點：（一）上海雖有租界，前途未可樂觀，除非利潤特別優厚，在極短時期能够收回資本的產業，吾則不足引起投資的興趣。投資於內地，利潤雖甚可觀，但一方面有被轟炸的危險，另一方面又怕資金沒有自由匯出的機會。因之，資金雖富而對於產業投資，却多裹足不前。這是游資不入正途的正面理由。（二）中國不能在上海統制外匯，外匯就發生黑市，而黑市的匯價因為中日戰事的延長漸漸緊縮，其他物資也隨之上漲，這是戰事進行中的必然現象。上海游資就以無統制為良機，依照外匯緊縮及物價高漲的趨向，進行投機，在歐戰發生以前，無論購買外匯或囤積貨物，均可不加思慮而獲巨利。投機獲利旣巨，而其危險性又爲一般所忽視，於是區區利息或冒險的利潤均不足誘導游資入正途。卽在滬設廠開工，地位比較安全，正當物價飛漲之際，獲利也有可觀；然而依照物價高漲的慣例而言，原料漲價時較製品為速，而在銷售方面，也以原料爲便，所以設廠製造往往不若國積原料爲有利。這不是經常的現象，固然不是完全阻止資本投放於產業，而事實上去年新設的工廠也有三百九十二家之多，不過我們可以斷言，這種現象的發生，足使投機所吸引的資本較投資爲巨。這是游資不入正途的反面理由。</p>
<p>但是投機決不能一帆風順的，牠的木身並且包含着自毀作用。去年九月歐戰發生以後，外滙的多頭投機者已受到嚴重的打擊，今年五月歐戰擴大以後，更令上海墮入空前的不景氣中。當時滙價步鬆，物價猛跌，傾家蕩產者頗不乏人，本來在滙價不斷趨縮的過程中，普遍不景氣的襲來，頗覺奇異，有人以爲這完全是歐戰擴大的結果；但實際上過去一年半中，投機過甚，價格在抬，因而生產過剩，進口過多，物價方面早已潛伏着崩壞的因素，卽以棉紗爲例，五月中旬二十支紗平均價達一千七百元，以當時滙價換算，與印度紗價相較，竟至高出五百元以上，在這種高物價之下，進口與生產雙管齊下，而實銷依然不振，其價格的慘跌，當然是可以預期的事情，默戰擴大，逃資流回，不過適成一個契機而已。這决景氣的衰沈，確實予投機者以極好的敎訓，打破他們坐享巨利的觀念，同時還暗示處置游資的方針。</p>
<p>但是現在游資的數量較前更多了，投機的空氣也沒有完全消失，最近二三個月來，各市　雖無重大的變，但是各種謠言日有數起，　有藉口，卽圖掀　作浪，其　極　動的情形，顯而易見。所以雖在游資過剩的時候，市塲利息却仍維持相當高率。依票據交換所的統計，本年七月份票據交換的每日平均額僅為　千八百三十三萬？，與戰前的一九三七年七月相較，雖批　物價指數已由一二九•一（國定稅則委員會編一九三七年平均）高至四八四·八（此係四月份指數，最近數月未有發表，或較此略低），而交換平均額反而减少八百〇四萬餘元，上海經濟情形的沈滯，頗可窺其一斑，然而本年七月份的銀行公單拆息平均爲二角八分，錢莊拆息爲二角，與一九三七年七月的一角一分與一角相較，均高出二倍或二倍以上。這種現象與銀行活期存款增加悄形相對照，足證上海游資尚在待機狀態中，倘使現在不以適當辦法抑制其活動，則在國際局面變動之際，不免又會掀風作浪！</p>
<p>「導」與「擊」應兼籌並顧</p>
<p>然則究竟以何種方法可使游資不復爲患？中國政府對此已施行各種對策，一方面在內地佈置投資的場所，使游資內流，不致毫無日標，文開辦轟炸保險及實施保息辦法，保證資本的安全；另一方面更許上海資金匯存內地，而在滬收取本息，保留資金流動的自由。各種吸引游資的辦法，已極完備，然而此項政策，尚失之溫和，未易奏效。</p>
<p>現在游資滯滬的最大原因，已如上述，實由一般尚信投機的利益甚於投資；如果不能打擊投機，使其明瞭投機的危險性，則雖在正面努力吸引游資內流，決不能達到目的。方今世界局面混亂，投機風險增大，正謀擇善而處。中國的金融大權，現在已相當的操之於國家銀行之手，若能乘此時機，隨時作突擊性之公開市塲政策。以國家的力量與投機者搏鬥，並予以致命的打擊，使一般持有游資者，懲前毖後，以投機為戒，對於上海無所流連，促成游資自動內流的時代，必可事半倍。</p>

<h3>過份利得稅寬恤救濟辦法之檢討</h3>
<p>— 王文楠</p>
<p>政府自先後開征所得稅及非常時期過份利得稅外，又於本年七月一日起實行征收遣產稅，於是我國直接稅制系統，至此已大體完備；「我國財務行政上，實為劃時代之設施，洵為慶幸也。非常時期過份利得稅開征以來，全國景後；工商各界，踴躍繳納；凡此均足以表示其報國之熱忱。查過份利得稅條例之規定：凡企業利得，超過其資本額百分之二十者，卽須就其超過額納稅；其在資本額百分之二十以內者，則免予征課。此項免稅規定，對於一般工商業，已眞體恤之意。今政府復鑒於小工商業之經營，與家庭生計攸關，當此百物高漲之際，必使其稅餘所得，較為優裕，方足以資積蓄而謀發展；其次，又以一般營利　業，在抗戰時期，遭受戰事空襲之威脅，營業資財之損失，亦不能不預爲之計；茲爲謀寬恤起見，特訂定「征收非常時期過份利得稅寬恤工商救濟戰事損失辦法」，計分七項，茲附錄如下；（一）對於每年利得額在五千元以下之工商，准予扣除六百元之免稅額；營業時間不足一年時，其免稅額，應就一年相當於其營業日數之比例，計算扣除之，（二）對於一般營利事業，准予逐年提存利得額十分之一，作爲抵補空襲被災等。因戰事所受損失之準備，暫不課稅。（三）項提存準備，應俟抗戰結束，或於期內合併，解散，歇業，淸理時，如未發生損失，或於抵補各該年損失外，仍有餘額，再行分別年度，計算補稅。（四）在本辦法施行前，受有戰事損失之營業，依照計征所得稅法令之規定，分年攤提。於本年仍未攤提凈盡時，其應攤之餘額，應以此項準備儘先劃補。（五）抗戰結束之年度，此項準備應卽停止提存，倘屆時因已往損失尚未提補足額，仍准繼續提存，惟應扣該年利得十分之一以內。補址損失之額爲限，仍有不足，應依照計征所得稅之規定，分別攤提之。（六）上項提存準備，納稅義務人，不得作爲分配紅利；於計征所得稅時，並不得作爲公積金，以三分之一併入資本計算。（七）本辦法第一第二兩項規定之寬恤救濟辦法，於計征一時營利事業利得稅時，不適用之，第二項規定之救濟辦法，於計征合併，解散，歇業，消理等營利事業之利得稅，亦不適用之。</p>
<p>統觀上述辦法第一第二兩項之規定，可知六百元之免稅額與十分之一戰事損失準備，均在利得額內扣除之。但計算應納利得稅額時，有令人發生疑問者：卽此項免稅額，從利得額內扣除時，是吾在提存戰事損失準備之前？抑在提存此項準備之後？按條文上雖無明白規定，固有待解釋之必要；然照第二項之規定，對於一般營利事業，准予逐年提存，利得額十分之一，作爲戰事損失準備；似已說明該項準　，係照利得總額提存十分之一；則免稅額之减除，定係在提存準備之後，然後再行計算過份利得稅額。茲爲便檢討起見，將過份利得稅原條例所規定之計算辦法，與寬恤救濟之計算辦法，分別舉例，以資比較兩種辦法下應納稅額之多寡。</p>
<p>（一）設有中華商店，資本一萬元，本年營業結果，獲有凈利四千元，計合資本額百分之四十，照過份利得稅　條例規定，除應納所得稅外，尚須征課利得稅。其計算辦法如下：</p>
<p>（二）今該商店資本仍爲一萬元，凈利額亦爲四千元，照寬恤救濟辦法，准予提存十分之一戰事損失準備，計四百元，又扣除六百元之免稅額，尚餘淨利爲三千元，計合資本額百分之三十，其計算應納利得稅額辦法如下：</p>
<p>「附註中設營業時間不足一年時，則六百元之免稅額，可與營業日數及全年日數比例折算扣除之。</p>
<p>計算　納過份利得稅額部份：</p>
<p>照上例所述，可知中華商店照寬恤救濟辦法，計算過份利得稅額（一二五元），較原條例計算之納稅額（三二五元），可减少十分之六。二，換言之：凡資本額在一萬元之小工商業，其每年利得在五千元以下者，照寬恤救濟辦法，計算過份利得稅額，可减輕達一倍以上，實受惠非淺，至於一般營利事業而論，其每年利得額，如超過五千元以上者，雖不能享受六百元免稅額之待遇，但實際上照寬恤救濟辦法，准予提存利得額十分之一戰事損失準備，暫小課稅。圳此項準備部份，目前至少在免稅之列。故寬恤救濟辦法之施行，嘉惠各業良多。</p>

<h3>「特捐」下的　盛澤絲綢近況</h3>
<p>筆者於前年本報復刊時，曾在本攔寫過二篇關于盛澤絲綢事業的文字，當時我曾剴切指出，盛澤絲綢在畸形發展下會逐漸慘淡下去的，現在這句話很不幸的給我所談言微中了，那絲經綢貨在，「統制」與「特損一之下，已正開始跑向崩潰之途，最近的發展，允其是以證明這竟是無可避免了的。</p>
<p>吾鄉盛澤，雖不是產絲之區，可是因了盛綢機織事業的發展，對於絲經市况，也大有影響，大前年蘇嘉路全錢淪陷後，震澤乾經市塲爲了運輸關係，有一部份移來盛地，同時開設的小型絲廠與經行，接踵而起，竟有數十家之多，於是這幾年來的盛澤，幾可把產綢之區和產絲之區，合而爲一，呈現了空前畸形的熱鬧，但好景不常，今年一開春，絲經爲了可以換取外匯之故，首先遭到統制，綢貨因平津　制進口，接着也推車碰壁，自上月「絲經特捐」成立，現在「直接織成品」綢貨，「特捐」也快將開始「征收」，這樣接二連三的重重打擊，絲廠經行是停工解散，機戶綢商是棄織改業，而今還在掙扎着的，則除了苟延殘喘，費了極大的力量與心思去從事冒險找出路以外，便是屈伏在統制之下聽任宰割而已。</p>
<p>所謂冒險找出路，說來也其實很淒慘，絲經自從貨運不能直接到達租界之後，英美洋行，對於採辦絲經，便有無從染指之概，衹能問接與某方商行成交，於是盛地一般善於經營的絲廠和經行，爲了不甘忍受，便設法偷運，把成担的絲交給包運者零零星星地避過交通綫統制者的耳目，偷偷地運到租界上來出銷，這些包運者大多是失業的生綢掮客，包運的方法，最初是很秘密可是利之所在，不久也便成了公開，一担經是十五小包，每决包運者運出一小包，貨主收包運者保證金一百元，到達目的地後，每一小包付與包運費二十五元至三十元，除了十餘元買通關節和旅費開支以外，一小包經可賺十餘元。路上也絕沒有危險而且迅捷，綢貨自然也照此推算論値，在這樣包運制度之下，盛地小型絲廠與經行，總算在無可奈何之下，勉强度日</p>
<p>綢貨呢，因爲上海銷路很有限，而且自西南內地貨運停頓以後，本來也祗剩下平津二路還有相當的去胃，木年四月間，平津限制進口，盛綢亦在被限之列，當地客家比較活動的，化了錢儘可提貨，沒有門路的，就給多方留難，甚至於把貨件沒收，承辦的盛綢莊家，時而接到客家速發的信，時而叉接到止裝的通知，時而要寄大包時而要改小包，時而北平發生了障碍，時而天津又截止登記，最近又設法改寄山東河北各地轉運，在這一種隉杌不定狀態下，盛綢也終於支撑到如今。</p>
<p>但而今呢，絲綢包運辦法旣經敗露，絲廠經行都因破壞秋制而給勒令停工閉鬥，甚至將主事者捉將「官」裹去，同時綢貨「特捐」成立在卽，平津限制益嚴，郵局且已將山東大宗郵包停寄，前途的悲慘，於此也不難想像而得的！（君美）</p>

<h3>捐助舊衣</h3>
<p>— 梅子</p>
<p>不論「那一個家庭裏，不合身的，過時的，半破的舊衣，必有些擱存着的，因為一個家庭自小孩到大人，陸續所存下來的，決不會沒有些舊衣裳的，尤其是資產階級的家庭裏，所剩的數量必更是可觀。這些舊衣既不要再穿，那任牠放着也太沒意思，有時倒反覺得多佔地位，要感到討厭哩。</p>
<p>現在徵募寒衣委員會中，正有一條徵募舊衣的規定，他們微集後用處很大，像施給難民等等，所以把舊衣捐助上去，是各人最低限度的應有天職。</p>
<p>眞的，秋風起了，難民們瑟瑟抖的情景又將重現在我們的眼前，想起許多高貴的人們在添製新衣之餘，難道竟忍心置之不問嗎？沒有一些人類的同情心嗎？</p>
<p>其實，舊衣在我們本來已用不到它，那麼落得捐送給寒衣委員會，使良心上可以得到一些安慰，何况是「爲善最樂」呢！</p>
<h3>白皮鞋</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>不拘什麼東西價錢愈貴，貨色愈壞，皮鞋也不例外。二十塊錢一雙的皮鞋抵不上戰前七八元一雙的好。今年的五月裹，我耗了十六塊錢買一雙皮鞋，穿到脚上，不到一月，皮面就有裂痕發現，那眞太不經濟了。</p>
<p>暑假前一二星期，偶然走過一家皮鞋店，看見櫉裏陳列着幾雙白帆布皮鞋，標價祇四元半。想到脚上的皮鞋再穿下去快要破了，好在是夏季時節，買一雙白皮鞋來替換，也可經濟一些。</p>
<p>於是我毫不吝惜的以四元半的代價，買了一雙，那知放在櫉窗裏去倒還可以，一拿到手，無論是面子，夾裹，皮底，都很低劣。戰前我們耗三元錢買一雙白皮鞋，怕還耍好多呢！</p>
<p>在一個年頭中，穿白皮鞋的時期很長，自四五月到九十月，至少可以穿半年。如果四元半錢買一雙白皮鞋，能穿牛年，那也還合算，那知我所賣的不到兩個月又穿破了。這年頭穿皮鞋眞使我想不出經濟的方法。</p>
<p>白皮鞋穿在脚上，一碰就黑，時常要塗鞋粉。可是懶於修飾的我，平時連皮鞋油都不大塗，白皮鞋上了脚，就難得上鞋粉。所以我的白皮鞋穿在脚上，就變成黑皮鞋呢！</p>
<p>同樣的白皮鞋，二三十元一雙的也不希罕，祗是白帆布的比較便宜。好出風頭的人，也決不要穿。時髦朋友穿的非白紋皮，就是白麂皮，和我所穿的當然不可同日而語了。</p>
<p>暑假中某天午後，走過虞洽卿路，看見一家女子擦鞋公司。顧客相當熱閙，而進去擦鞋的十九穿着白皮鞋。不是上白粉，就是上膠粉。擦一次正項，小賬，也要耗三五角錢。聽說時髦朋友穿的白皮鞋一天會擦一兩次，祇要被人踏黑了，就去擦。所以盛穿白皮鞋的季節，每一家女子擦鞋公司，生意特別好。但另一面，人們爲了擦白皮鞋，又不知要耗多少錢，我不禁爲之昨舌呢！</p>
<h3>烤囊草笈</h3>
<p>— 一之</p>
<p>西歐愛惜物力之國，有人勵行省煤炭之經濟烹調。乃取舊木箱，緊塞稻草於其中，或塞壓緊不留微隙之舊報紙，以代保暖之棉胎，或向木匠店搜取刨花，以代稻草，可以經月不換而用至一年之久。迨稻草等物，塡滿木箱，假使此箱係作長方形，則使留出足容鍋或罐之兩深穴，如爲正方之箱留一穴，决於穴口四周罩以布，或取便於保暖之絨，張諸穴口而縫合之，務使鍋罐置穴中，能緊貼而深深包住。其物荷語名之曰草笈Hooi-Kist，音譯作篙笈，可用以代微火之燉，如使暫經大火烤過之食物，急卽趁熱，埋置其中，密閉許久而後開食，則所耗火力，比諸尋常爐煮，不過六分之一。而其後永保沸點以下不過高而數不盈百之熱度，旣滿三倍於爐煮之時晷，卽如小火之燉，而由漸透熟矣。查此置草箱中經濟緩燉之法，節省燃料，利一。熱度不過高，維他命Vitamine（卽養生質）不易消失，利二。熱力並非自下而上，乃從各方面平均透入，永無皮焦裹不熟之弊，利三。厥味特美，利四。又草笈在旣閉後，非至透熱，絕不開視，水蒸汽無從化散，是以食物所加之水，應比爐煮爲少。如煮飯在平時，應加三倍於米之水者，今則兩倍已足。其旣燉熟之物</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>上星期的菜單中，星期三那天，本來是配菜的　菜炒肉絲，不料「肉」字排錯了一個「牛」字，變成　菜炒牛絲。牛絲是英文「新聞」News的諧音，菜單中來了一樣「薺菜炒新聞」，豈不是大大的笑話麼？說起薺菜，本來是菜蔬中最低廉的東西，田野裹到處可以找到，但是現在到了都市中，就算是一樣名貴的時鮮菜，時價要買到六七角錢一，要是單獨的炒起來，恐怕還裝不滿一大碗哩。不得已，我們只得買道麼一二角錢，和肉絲一同炒炒，也算湊成了一樣葷菜。要是做素菜，薺菜炒筍片，可以上筵席，但是現在沒有筍，就是有，也未免貴族化；算來只有把它和蠶豆瓣一起炒，比較的還算便宜，味兒，倒也是很可口的。</p>

<h3>最快的行</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>行的問題在近代人類生活上，有着極密切的關係，火車，汽車，輪船飛機這四種「行」的基本器械，對於我們人類的貢獻，誰都不會吾認有不可磨滅的偉大，可是人類的慾望不一定能滿足，目前飛機最高的速率已經不能適合一般人的要求了，幸而科學家有先見之明，它把四種行的基本器械，努力的改進，在速率方面可說已達到超越的地步了，現在就分別的來闡釋一下：</p>
<p>（火車）大家都知道，火車的速度是很高的，可是理論上講，火車本身的速度要超過火車現在的速度，因爲蒸汽機械大部分的「能」空氣的阻力，鐵輪與軌道的摩擦力消耗去不少，科學家本此原理研究的結果，已將火車消耗的能力儘量减至百分之三，最大而最有力的流錢型蒸汽機車，能拖車十四輛，速率每小時達一〇〇英里，可說是目前最快的火車了，這種新式的火車在西歐大陸上早已馳騁一時哩。</p>
<p>（汽車）有人設汽車能每小時走四〇〇英里，就覺希罕的了，有志者事竟成，這句話並不海闊天空，英人的翰柯柏John　Cobb新近在美國駕駛一輛汽車速率達每小時三六八·八五英里，造成世界上新的陸上速率記錄，這可說是目前最快的汽車了。</p>
<p>（輪船）「水中的速度本來就沒有陸上來得高，」這句話太陳腐的了，自從航艦發明後，水中「行」的問題，有驚人的進步，現在英國康白爾爵士Srb　M．Compbell的「藍鳥」號，曾創每小時一四一·七四英里的記錄，他不是勝過陸上的火車嗎？這眞是一隻最快的輪船哪！</p>
<p>（飛機）飛機是「行」的最高權威，速率保持冠軍，以前要行數月一年的路程，現今藉飛機瞬息卽達，最快的飛機，要算寇蒂斯Curtiss　P04號驅逐機，每小時能行四〇〇至四五〇·英里，千里路途二時許卽達，眞神速得很啊！</p>

<h3>人生的三個教訓（三）</h3>
<p>（三）看這二人的生活，可知一是栽培靈魂，一是疏忽靈魂。世界上一切有機動物，皆當使之有生長的機會，不然必定偎死·要想生長，必須培植，正如花木要常常加水和肥料，又如嬰孩要常常喂他奶及共他　嬰食品，吾則必要飢渴而死。</p>
<p>所以我們的心靈，若相信他是活的，也當增植，不然也要餓死。但要培植心靈，應當怎樣培植呢？唯一培植心靈的方法，就是當與上帝交通。有種人的心靈是半死的，還有挽救的可能。有種人的心靈是完全死了，這種人雖然生在世上，也是死的，因為他所活動的是他的身體，他的靈魂却早已死了。幸而上帝有起死回生的能力，如猶太先知以西結說：上帝能使枯骨成軍…』（以西結　卅七10）但看我們願不願復甦罷了。若是不願，那是自殺，不能怨上帝。</p>
<p>這兩人中的一人說：「我沒有空地可以收藏…」（路加十二17）世人盡是這樣充滿了一切物質思想，不切一點餘地，使上帝可以居住，且無一點餘地可以容留別人。耶穌所說一個專心注意物質生活的人，他所打算的完全是他自已，全不想到上帝或他人，這等人的心靈，可以說是失掉了，他的生命是日漸縮小，小得只知有自己，而不知有別人。我們在上兩段和這裏所提的兩個人，一個是念念不忘耶和華，一個是處處想到自己，結果他們兩人，一個是耶和華把他的靈魂要回去，一個是耶和華救了他的性命，使他行活人的路·希望讀者諸君把這三個敎訓記在心裏，不以幻為眞，不以失為得，少注意物質的享受，而多努力於心靈的培養。君子諜道不謀食，旨哉斯言也。</p>

<h3>猶太人在上海</h3>
<p>— 朱鴻</p>
<p>在偶然的巧遇裏，引起我對上海的猶太人底好奇心來。</p>
<p>有一次，在靜安寺路上，被一家小小雜貨店吸引住，原來很小的店面，恰設了幾處的廣吿櫥，在公寓門口仇設了一所，擺設樸實而精巧，價廉而還有高貴贈品，向裏面一探視，原來是猶太人。</p>
<p>又一决，路過一家賣買郵票的店舖，門上注明「中國話，裏面也會講。」友人手指點了一下姑在櫃台後底紅髮店主，似乎明悟似地談：「哦，是猶太人。</p>
<p>猶太人，猶太人——給我的卽象逐漸深刻，每當和友人談起上海的猶太人時，他們總會想起沙士比亞在威尼斯商人裏那借錢要割肉的夏勞克來。</p>
<p>和基督徒講起猶太人，他們會記起出賣耶穌的猶太；和商人講起時，彷佛和放印子錢底印度人，同樣的出奇。</p>
<p>可是，聰明不是罪過，同樣地，不管怎　圓滑的說，以人種分別人類的優劣畢竟是不合理；難道猶太人的脈管裏眞流着不潔的血液麽？難道靈巧做賣買，也成一椿罪惡麽？</p>
<p>猶太人頭腦是敏捷的，上海投機風潮裏，一個平凡的股票經紀人竟以投資外滙成了暴發戶，成了上海金融巨頭之一底喬直甫，可不是猶太人麽？</p>
<p>成十成萬的猶太我，漂泊到上海來，上海原是冒險家的樂園，祗要一過白波橋，就好看見熙熙攘攘的特殊民族了。</p>
<p>就在百老匯路畔，三三兩兩的猶太難民，在賣報紙。在胸口掛了只皮袋，他們新聞紙的價目沒有一定的，聽任人家由於憐憫，多多施捨，把紙幣投向袋裏去，……</p>
<p>在那裏也開設了許多店，店面比一般烟兌店還狹小，原本他們的　色多由德國帶來；但是現在却逐漸賣光，添進的貨物雖然便宜，質地却是很惡劣的了。</p>
<p>那裏的猶太店，多半舊貨店，糖菓店，郵票店，舊書店</p>
<p>一次，在霞飛路畔，我看見了一個流落的猶太人，鬆蓬的頭髮，褐色的面孔，破舊的服裝，拖了一雙有洞的皮鞋，面孔那麽悒鬰，藍色的眼睛，包含了說不出的，無吿的苦楚，胸膛前掛了一塊紙板，上面歪歪寫了以後那麼的中國字。</p>
<p>我是一個猶太難民，幾天沒有吃飽了；請買我的貨色，可憐可憐我呀！</p>
<p>我不禁感到一股凄凉的意味來，無國之民底悲哀呀！</p>
<h3>披上了羊皮的狼羣</h3>
<p>— 而行</p>
<p>前天，我發見了二個小竊手，年齡十二三，衣服容飾，像是普通中小學的學生。</p>
<p>他們是年幼，活潑，說笑着，打鬧着。可是在事破後，禁不起我幾聲　叱，他們灰白了臉，哭泣了，哀求了·指着那遠遠地走着的大漢，急促地抖着聲音拚出個「…他…他…」字來。</p>
<p>根據他們的自訴：他倆是拾荒的窮孩子，為了他們的生存，被大漢以金錢誘來，在誘脅之下，經過了二個月多的訓練，就進行幹這行業。那大漢是在監督他們的！</p>
<p>我沒有把他們送捕，對他們說：「這裏有四毛錢，拿了回到你們父母那裏去吧！」</p>
<p>「孩子是天眞的，是純潔的。」但社會的誘脅，把童孩的天性喪失。不祇是童孩，以及軟弱的人們！</p>
<p>在這充滿了虛偽欺詐，荊棘滿地的「孤島」上，那些狼羣，却披上了羊皮，在羊羣裏生活着呢！</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第七章　「把他押起來」</p>
<p>霍桑揮揮手，似阻止他不必再說。繼續問道：」你在什麼地點瞧見他的？在房間裏，還是外面？一</p>
<p>阿根道：「外面，他剛才從五五六號出來。</p>
<p>「一個人嗎？」</p>
<p>「是的，好像是向雷梯間那邊去的，此刻也許不在房間裹。不過我看見他空着手出來，一定不是搬走。」</p>
<p>霍桑不再說話，向我點點頭。我知道他要付酬報了，我便摸出皮夾，揀出十張十元的法幣交給霍桑。霍桑接過，順手向阿根的手中一塞。那茶房自然有一番假意的推辭。霍桑　止住他說：「別客氣。現在你到面去找你的朋友小李，間他這姓孫的有沒有回來，再吿訴他如果我們要開門，叫他儘放心給我們便利。」</p>
<p>阿根連連點了點頭，回身就走。</p>
<p>霍桑父喚住他道：「且慢，你停一回瞧見了我，不必招呼。他在不在，給我僩暗號好了。」</p>
<p>七十一號父點點頭，不發一言，就向樓梯口那面走去。霍桑又附着我耳朶說話。</p>
<p>「你先跟他下去，小心些，不要太接近。我打一個電話就來。」</p>
<p>霍桑說完，就回身　那甬道的西口裹去我也就跟着阿根所走的方向，從水泥的樓梯下去。阿根走得很快，我走釗第六層時，還不曾追着他；到了第五層，仍不見阿根的影踪。我索性放慢了步子，緩緩　入甬道，找尋那五五六號房間。這房間的地位比較曲折，我轉了兩個灣，方才找到。那房門關着，門外也沒有人。我當然不便就去敲鬥，但把耳朶湊在門上聽了一聽，裏面似乎沒有聲音。我向左右瞧瞧，甬道中並沒有人來往。我就蹲下身子，把眼睛湊到門上的鑰匙孔上，向房間裏張望。（一一五）</p>

<p>在這個時候，我總是暫時把身子縮回，默默地靠牆等候着。或者羨慕地瞅瞅甬道那一邊跑來跑去的，那些男的，女的大學牛們。他們嬉笑着，大聲地說着話。…</p>
<p>我又禁不住望望前面晃動的人頭，暗暗驚奇着：「怎樣</p>

<h3>The Situation in Vietnam is Fluctuating; French Authorities Resolve to Resist Aggression; Rumors Spread that the US is Drafting a New Protest Against Japan's Southward Advance; China Concentrates Large Forces and Closely Monitors Future Developments</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Chinese circles in Chongqing are astonished by the ever-changing nature of the Franco-Japanese negotiations in Hanoi. It is said that one day the talks are progressing smoothly, the next day Japan has issued an ultimatum, and then a few hours later, the ultimatum is withdrawn. The Chinese newspapers are calling these negotiations "Vietnam [Yo-Yo]", because of their fluctuating nature. According to recent news, the negotiations have broken down, and Xiyuan has left Vietnam. However, the Chinese side believes that Vietnam will eventually yield because Vietnam has few troops and lacks the strength to resist the Japanese army's advance. The Chinese are now eagerly awaiting the latest news to know what action Japan will take after the expiration of the ultimatum at midnight today. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Hanoi – French officials have announced that the deadline for the Japanese ultimatum will expire at midnight tonight. If Japan attempts to act on its final demands and invades Annam, the French army will immediately order its troops to resist. Since this announcement, the situation in Annam has become tense again this morning. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – According to reliable foreign sources, the negotiations that resumed yesterday in Hanoi have broken down again. With the deadline for the ultimatum approaching, the situation in Vietnam remains tense. According to unconfirmed reports, Japanese nationals boarded ships yesterday in Haiphong and Saigon. If Vietnam does not surrender unconditionally, the Japanese representative, Xiyuan, will lead his staff out of Hanoi today. Chinese newspapers have prominently published news of a stronger US stance, which they say will have a final impact on Japan. Reuters Guangzhou reports that the Japanese military authorities are not allowed to disclose information about the Vietnam situation. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – It is widely believed that the State Department is preparing a new protest to be delivered to Japan before the Japanese ultimatum to Vietnam expires at noon today. Officials declined to comment on the above-mentioned actions last night. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – According to sources today, the US government is giving clear consideration to handling the oil embargo against Japan. They also hinted to reporters that as Japan makes demands on Vietnam, the government may suspend issuing oil export licenses to prevent US oil products from flowing into Japan. (International News Service, 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to a telegram from Kunming, relevant parties have obtained information from Hanoi that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux's attitude is very tough. Observers generally believe that Vietnam will not yield to Japan. The railway tracks north of Hekou on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway are being actively dismantled by the Chinese side, and the Yunnan Provincial authorities have strengthened border defenses. According to transportation sources, several Japanese warships are concentrated in Tokyo Bay, with landing intentions. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Vichy – A spokesman for the Vichy government announced last night that although Franco-Japanese negotiations are deadlocked, French officials believe there is still a chance for an agreement without resorting to force to resolve the Annam issue. Governor-General Decoux of Annam rejected Japan's military demands on Annam last week, which included 25,000 Japanese troops passing through Annam and building naval and air bases in Annam. According to reports received here indirectly, Japan once changed the number of Japanese troops passing through Tokyo. At the same time, the Japanese government ordered the evacuation of Japanese nationals in Annam. According to Chinese sources here, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has realized that Annam will eventually allow Japanese troops to pass through, so he is making every preparation to deal with new incidents. At present, 200,000 Chinese troops have been concentrated on the Annam border, and all highways and other key transportation routes leading to Annam have been cut off. (United Press, 22nd) Vichy – Authoritative sources admitted last night that the Vietnam negotiations had reached a difficult stage, saying that Tokyo's diplomatic efforts and Hanoi's military authorities were conducting negotiations simultaneously. Hanoi was handling the implementation of all decisions. All sorts of difficulties arise in Hanoi. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>French Army Has Prepared Everything; Enters Wartime Emergency Status</p>
<p>Hanoi – After Xiyuan, the leader of the Japanese military delegation, left here yesterday, there were reports from Saigon that the ships evacuating Japanese nationals had already departed. However, to the best of our knowledge here, the Japanese warships anchored in Haiphong have not yet departed as of last night. Since Japan Airlines recently opened a new route to Hanoi, it has also been suspended since yesterday, and all facilities in Annam related to the new route have been removed. French officials were still optimistic last night, believing that the United States would eventually take action to force Japan to abandon its ultimatum and resume peace talks without infringing on French sovereignty over Annam. According to informed sources, although Franco-Japanese negotiations have been going on for a long time, there is still no result. French officials said that they were prepared to make concessions on certain military facilities that Tokyo and Vichy had promised to Japan, but only in a way that would not lead to Japan's actual occupation of Annam. It is said that the final demands in the Japanese ultimatum exceeded the Tokyo-Vichy agreement. French military leaders here strongly advocate that the government reject the Japanese demands and resist with force if the Japanese army invades Annam. Yesterday, almost all French troops in Annam were mobilized. Several cities conducted air defense exercises last night, and the local air force was ready to deal with air raids. The Annam government officially announced last night that the breakdown of the negotiations was due to Japan's final demands, and that the authorities had to abide by the recent instructions of the Vichy government. After Xiyuan suddenly led his subordinates to Haiphong, the French army entered a state of wartime emergency, ready to fight, causing the general tension here to reach its peak. According to the Vietnamese government, negotiations were progressing smoothly yesterday, but before an agreement could be reached, Japan suddenly made new demands, which ultimately made negotiations impossible and led to a deadlock. As for the nature of the new demands made by Japan, officials seem unwilling to disclose anything, but French people speculate that unacceptable conditions will include the following: (1) 20,000 Japanese troops occupying Hanoi; (2) Jurisdiction over the "Lang Son" and Lao Cai railways; (3) Use of the Gia Lam airfield near Hanoi, etc. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>New Japanese Demands Rejected; Apparently Still Afraid to Use Force Immediately</p>
<p>Vichy – Although officials of the Petain government admit that French officials in Vietnam have rejected "Japan's harsh demands," they still believe today that Japan and Vietnam may soon move towards reconciliation. Officials here say that Japan's request for 25,000 Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam and to establish several naval and air bases in Vietnam has been rejected by Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux. In addition, the French government spokesman confirmed that the British report that the New Hebrides and New Caledonia had returned to General de Gaulle's "Free France." (International News Service, 22nd)</p>
<p>Vichy – Last night, French political figures announced that the situation in French Annam was still extremely critical. The only satisfactory point was that Japan was still afraid to take military action, but because the negotiations between the two sides had failed to find a compromise that would satisfy both sides, the situation remained worrisome. According to sources here, Major General Xiyuan, the leader of the Japanese military delegation, has left Hanoi. Although this does not mean that the negotiations have been suspended, French officials are quite worried about future developments. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Due to Japan's Insatiable Demands, Hanoi Negotiations Deadlocked</p>
<p>Vichy – The French government officially acknowledged last night the seriousness of the Franco-Japanese deadlock over the Annam issue and that the negotiations had entered a "difficult stage." When commenting on the deadlock in the Hanoi negotiations, an official here said, "Anything is possible at the moment." However, officials denied reports of a Japanese ultimatum to the Annam authorities, saying only that the Japanese note was a strong request to quickly end the negotiations. As for the sudden departure of Major General Xiyuan, leader of the Japanese military delegation, officials did not criticize it, but said that the Hanoi negotiations deadlocked due to Japan's insatiable demands, which was a natural development. It is said that the Vichy government cabled Japan yesterday, saying that both sides hoped that the Hanoi negotiations would end soon, but that any Franco-Japanese agreement must not hinder France's interests in Annam or infringe upon French sovereignty. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>China Obtains New International Route; New Highway Built Across Xikang; Connects India to Calcutta</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Professor Zhang Qiyun, an expert on the Supreme National Defense Committee, recently wrote that Free China has a new outlet in the west, from Tachienlu (Kangding) in Xikang to Calcutta. There is now a railway from Calcutta to Sadiya, and it is only 100 miles from Sadiya to Chayu (Kangbian), and only 1,200 miles from Chayu to Tachienlu. This section of the highway is already under construction. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Occurs in Lucun East</h3>
<p>A certain place in Shandong – Japanese troops who counterattacked the Chinese in two routes from Lucun on the afternoon of the 19th were defeated by the Chinese in the area of Yongxing Guanzhuang (east of Lucun). On the morning of the 20th, the Japanese again gathered a large force of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, and under the cover of three Japanese aircraft, advanced from Lucun to Tianzhuang (east of Lucun), Gaozhuang (east of Tianzhuang), and other places. The Chinese army is currently engaged in fierce fighting. (Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Confucius Temple to be Rebuilt; Underground</h3>
<p>Chongqing – If Confucius, the sage of ancient China, were to be reborn today and travel to Chongqing, he would be greatly surprised because the Confucius Temple in Chongqing is about to be built underground. According to Huang Jun, Secretary-General of the New Life Movement Association, the construction of the Confucius Temple was decided after Finance Minister Kong donated 100,000 yuan for the reconstruction and the civilian houses near the Confucius Temple in the city were bombed. It is said that Finance Minister Kong is a descendant of Confucius. (United Press, 22nd)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Jointly Discuss the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Just as the situation in Vietnam has fallen into a major crisis due to Japan's insatiable demands, US authorities are conducting talks in Washington with British and Australian envoys regarding the Far East situation. While US Secretary of State Hull recently stated that these talks "do not include discussions of proposals beyond the usual exchange of information," news from various Japanese sources indicates that the scope of these talks is quite broad! After many meetings, issues such as Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies, and the joint defense of Britain, the United States, and Australia have been discussed. Moreover, Britain has suggested to the United States that it be allowed to use the British naval base in Singapore. It is difficult to know the outcome of the talks at present, but the Japanese newspapers' continuous attacks on Britain and the United States are enough to prove the significance of this move to the Far East crisis. If Japan's oppression of French Vietnam is the main reason for the recent turbulence in the South Pacific, then there is no doubt that this cooperation between Britain and the United States marks the beginning of a new movement to stabilize the Far East.</p>
<p>The main reason why the Far East has gone from a small spark to a prairie fire is the lack of cooperation between the relevant powers. The failure of the Non-Recognition Doctrine and the lack of achievement of the Beijing Nine-Power Treaty exposed the lack of foresight of the powers on the Far East issue and their inability to slightly sacrifice their own private interests or prejudices in the face of a major threat. In the past nine years, the problem has expanded from a local area in Northeast China to the entire South Pacific, and the war has spread from a corner of Asia to the European continent and the British Isles. However, until the Sino-Burmese and Sino-Vietnamese negotiations of two months ago, there were no signs of a common response between the powers. As a result, the two arteries were unreasonably closed, and the threat of aggression reached the entire South Pacific. If it were not for the fact that the war of resistance in China had already deeply depleted the strength of the aggressors, and if it were not for the fact that the defeated French Vietnamese authorities were still unwilling to over-yield to the powerful, then the joint defense plans currently discussed by the powers might be greatly discounted. Fortunately, the wait-and-see attitude and complacency of the powers have been forced to cease to exist due to the insatiable desire of the aggressors, and they have turned to seeking effective countermeasures. Although this is somewhat slow, it is all the more precious because it is so late.</p>
<p>However, in today's Far East situation, all kinds of aggressive adventures have become unstoppable, and preparations have already taken the lead. They cannot be stopped by a show of force or peripheral countermeasures. It is reported that the United States will issue a new protest before noon yesterday regarding the Vietnam issue, which may increase the courage and determination of the Vietnamese authorities who are eager for US assistance. However, it is doubtful whether it will have a real effect today when a preliminary compromise has been reached between France and Japan. Moreover, if Japan's demands on French Vietnam are unfortunately realized, strategically, it would be a major blow to the stronghold position of Singapore. The effect of the US fleet's use of Singapore is far less than it was a year ago--or even a month ago. It is said that US officials are currently considering the British suggestion regarding the Singapore naval base and are carefully reviewing what effect this move would have on Japan. It is hoped that this consideration process will not be delayed until the military value of the Singapore naval base is reduced day by day.</p>
<p>Regardless of the gains and losses of the European war, Britain and the United States should not relax their grip on the Far East because of the constraints of Europe. In particular, the United States should live up to the expectations of all the people in the world who uphold justice and resolutely take the task of stabilizing the Far East and the Pacific as its own. Not long ago, it was precisely because the powers were too concerned about European events and ignored the Far East that the Vietnam incident occurred immediately in response. But now that Britain and the United States have engaged in cooperative negotiations, even if the negotiations can quickly achieve something, they may not be able to solve all the problems in the Far East. Although Britain and the United States are extremely powerful, they inevitably have the drawback of being too far away to have an effect on the special position and situation in the Far East. On the other hand, today's China has become the main driving force for stabilizing Asia, and the vast Soviet Union's weight on the west coast of the Pacific is no less than that of the Danube River Basin or the Baltic Sea. Therefore, China and the Soviet Union cannot be ignored when stabilizing the Far East at this time. The past discord between Britain and the Soviet Union was the main reason for Britain's connivance at Japan's atrocities. Even today, if Japan does not reach a considerable understanding with the Soviet Union, it will certainly not dare to engage in a desperate southward advance. The move of envoy Tatekawa to the Soviet Union is enough to know the current trend of Japan's foreign policy. If British and American cooperation does not involve the Soviet Union, it is enough to give Japan room for horizontal and vertical operation. In this regard, the war of resistance in China happens to form a hub for British, American, and Soviet cooperation in the Far East, and apart from promoting China's victory in the war of resistance, any other plan or measure to stabilize the Far East can be said to have no possibility of success on its own.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Discuss the Far East Issue; China and the Soviet Union Will Be Invited to Participate; US Considers Using Singapore Port, Japanese Officials Express Serious Concern</h3>
<p>London – The Times diplomatic correspondent said today that other countries that have a relationship with maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, such as China, the Soviet Union, and the Dutch East Indies, may be invited to participate in the talks currently being conducted by Britain and the United States in Washington on the Pacific issue. (International News Service, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – According to authoritative sources last night, Britain has suggested to the US Navy that it be allowed to use the Singapore naval base. It is believed here last night that Britain very much hopes that the US fleet can use the Singapore naval base as a deterrence zone against Japan, so that Britain itself can devote itself wholeheartedly to its own life and death. US officials said last night that they were giving careful consideration to the British suggestion and were carefully reviewing what effect this move would have on Japan. When commenting on the State Department's recent negotiations with the British Ambassador and the Australian Minister, diplomatic figures said, "The boundary between 'discussion' and 'negotiation' is very small." According to Secretary of State Hull, the talks were a "discussion" rather than a "negotiation." Observers pointed out that the US Navy is very familiar with all the circumstances of the Singapore naval base because US warships participated in British naval exercises there several years ago. Observers pointed out last night that Republican presidential candidate Wilkie's policy announced yesterday could facilitate the combined use of the Singapore naval base by Britain and the United States. Wilkie has always advocated giving firm assistance to China and leasing other bases in the Pacific to protect US rights in that area. Wilkie's statement of this policy should allow the administration to proceed with negotiations on Singapore without any political discord in the general election in the future. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – According to official reports, Japanese officials expressed serious concern about the possibility of cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Pacific region. The above reports originated from talks between the US Secretary of State, the British Ambassador, and the Australian Minister. Asahi Shimbun reported that the transfer of the Singapore British naval base to the United States would not only mean the United States' actual participation in the European war, but also a great threat to Japan's control of the West Pacific. Japan must be prepared for any possible British and American plot. The cooperation between Britain and the United States is now taking concrete form, and Japan must make preparations in military and diplomatic aspects to cope with any eventuality. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Nippo reported that the Tokyo authorities have a fear that the US Navy's use of the Singapore naval base will cause serious disturbances in the world. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese newspapers today vehemently attacked the possibility of the United States using the Singapore naval base to block Japan's southward advance. The Asahi Shimbun said, "Japan cannot tolerate this trend because this trend hinders Japan's hegemony in the West Pacific." The Hochi Shimbun criticized the United States for attempting to be independently superior in the entire Pacific. The newspaper finally warned, "The United States should bear all responsibility for the various circumstances arising from this matter." (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Philippines Has Abandoned Autonomous Defense Plan; Quezon Expresses Willingness to Cooperate with the United States in View of the Weaknesses of Small Countries Being Violated</h3>
<p>Manila – According to informed sources, the attempt by the Filipinos to defend their own security and defend against aggression when the United States grants them complete independence in 1946 has now been abandoned. The German victory over small European countries has made the leaders of the Philippines believe that the safety of the island cannot be achieved without</p>
<p>US Protection.</p>
<p>The first step towards cooperation between the Philippine Republic Army and the US military stationed in the Philippines is said to have been decided at a recent meeting between Philippine President Quezon, US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre, and US Army Commander in the Philippines Colonel Grunert. General MacArthur, former Chief of Staff of the US Army and military advisor to President Quezon for the past five years, did not attend the meeting. General MacArthur's plan to enable the Philippines to defend itself after 1946 has been greatly reduced. When the Philippines adopted General MacArthur's plan in 1936, it planned to defend itself without US assistance when it declared independence in 1946. The Philippines is no longer adopting General MacArthur's suggestion to</p>
<p>Train Soldiers</p>
<p>40,000 soldiers annually, but has decided to train only 20,000 soldiers annually. It is said that Quezon has notified Washington that the Philippine government is willing to fully cooperate with the US defense program and welcomes the United States to send new forces to the Philippines for training. The President also stated that although he rarely expresses his opinion on the issue of independence, his desire to see the Philippines fully independent in 1946 has not changed. In announcing the deletion of General MacArthur's plan, the Philippine President said that he no longer believed that the Philippines, with its limited economic capabilities, could defend itself against aggression. Under General MacArthur's plan, the Philippine Republic had spent 4.5 million yuan annually on military preparations. MacArthur believed that if the Philippines adopted large-scale military training, making everyone a powerful fighter, the security of the island could be defended by this system of universal conscription. MacArthur's defense program is based on this theory. However, since May, the</p>
<p>Nazi Invasion</p>
<p>Of the Low Countries, the situation has changed significantly. Without modern weapons, even if the Philippines had a huge army, it would be useless. The Philippine army currently has only a "navy" including two 55-foot torpedo boats and an air force including 35 small aircraft, and no huge coastal guns. Therefore, President Quezon is very skeptical about whether his government can provide the huge military expenses necessary for defense. The first step in the new program of cooperation between the Philippine army and the US military is said to be the expansion of the Philippine army's military strength in Mindanao, the large island at the southernmost tip of the Philippine Islands, less than 100 miles from Dutch Borneo, while the US Army will station a small number of</p>
<p>Troops</p>
<p>In Zamboanga. Coincidentally, while the Philippines is revising its military program, the manpower and fighter aircraft of the US Army stationed in the Philippines have been substantially increased. Prior to this year, according to the theory that the US Army would withdraw from the Philippines in 1946, the United States had no new troops stationed here. At present, the United States is quietly increasing the number of technicians and aviation personnel. Nichols Field outside Manila has become a base for US Air Force activities, with 12 new aircraft arriving every month. Although two new barracks have been added to accommodate the increased personnel, many non-active officers still have to live in nearby locations. It is said that all the houses in Fort Stotsenburg, 57 miles north of Manila, are full. At present, the US Army's defense plan here, unlike MacArthur's large-scale infantry system, adopts a small number of well-trained and mobile troops, with the air force as its backing. These troops all travel in fast-moving armored vehicles, with field artillery and other weapons. In recent months, this place has received many</p>
<p>Good Equipment</p>
<p>It has aroused much speculation here how the Philippine government's revision of the military program will affect the position of General MacArthur, the Philippine President's advisor. General MacArthur resigned from his important position as Chief of Staff of the US Army in 1936 to come here. Shortly after setting up the military program for the Philippines, he was appointed as the commander of the Philippine army by President Quezon. (United Press, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American-Soviet Cooperation - Aid to China's Resistance - Newspaper Reports Overseas Goods to Chongqing Have Found a New Route</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Nichinichi Shimbun recently published a news item emphatically stating that a new route has been found for foreign goods transported to China. These goods will be landed in Vladivostok, Soviet Union, and then transported to Chongqing via the Siberian Railway and the Northwest Highway of China. It stated, "The United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union are currently cooperating to assist the Chongqing government of China in continuing its war against Japan. Among these efforts, the United States recently provided China with a new loan of 135 million U.S. dollars. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui has been in talks with Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin in Chongqing since the 8th of this month, hoping that after the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Burma Road are successively blocked, they can switch to this circuitous Vladivostok route. It is reported that the two sides only reached a final decision on the 17th of this month. The method is to allocate a certain amount from the aforementioned U.S. loan of 135 million U.S. dollars specifically for the purpose of purchasing and transporting goods through Vladivostok. During the talks between China and the Soviet Union, all negotiation processes were also notified to British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and U.S. Ambassador to China, Johnson, at any time."

<h3>Willkie's Speech - Advocates Economic Aid to China - Develops Bases in the Pacific and Recognizes Britain as America's Only Friend</h3>
<p>San Francisco: Willkie, the Republican candidate for the U.S. presidency, delivered a speech on foreign policy here yesterday, stating that Britain is our first line of defense and our only current friend. We must give them aid and continue to aid them. We must help Britain to the degree that wise and effective experts in this field determine is appropriate. A free, strong, and progressive China can best assist us in our objectives in the Pacific. Therefore, we should provide China with economic assistance to achieve this goal. He advocated reviewing the acquisition and development of air force bases in the Pacific to protect American interests in the Pacific. Willkie criticized the current government, blaming it for assisting in the overthrow of democracy, saying that the current government should bear direct responsibility for the current war. It is absurd and untenable to view President Roosevelt as a guarantor of democracy. The overseas world is undergoing great changes. If Britain wins, Germany will rebel against Hitler. If Germany wins, the United States will be isolated and resist a hostile and omnipotent world. The isolation of the United States is a direct result of the diplomatic policy of the past eight years. If Britain fails, we will be in a completely disadvantageous and isolated position. No country in the world other than Britain is worthy of American understanding and goodwill. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>San Francisco: Willkie announced his foreign policy here last night, advocating that the United States should not hesitate to decisively aid the Nationalist government of Chongqing, because America greatly needs a free, strong, and democratic Chinese ally. Other foreign policies included: (1) Continuing to expand aid to Britain; (2) Developing and strengthening national defense so that no country dares to invade the United States; (3) Revitalizing American industry and maintaining all American democratic organizations; (4) Making good use of credit loans and other economic agreements to develop domestic industry and commerce abroad.

<p>Chongqing: The spokesman for the Chinese Military Affairs Commission discussed the past week's war, stating that the battles in Jin, Yu, Su, and Anhui provinces have been relatively fierce recently. The Chinese army has repeatedly achieved victories on all fronts. The more important aspects of the battle are described as follows:</p>
<p>Jin-Yu: Since the Japanese army in Jin was repeatedly defeated, they have transferred over 10,000 reinforcements in the past week, launching fierce attacks in various areas along the Zhengtai Railway, including Yangquan, Pinding, Xiyang, and Mengxian. The Chinese army met the enemy on multiple fronts, inflicting heavy casualties. At the same time, on the southern section of the Baijin Highway and both sides of the Jinbo Highway, since the Chinese army launched a full-scale attack, they have successively recovered Li Chuanzhen, attacked Lan Chezhen, and even briefly stormed into Jincheng, forcing attacks on Yangcheng Gaoping Changzi, and annihilating several thousand Japanese soldiers. Currently, Jincheng, Yangcheng, and Gaoping are still tightly surrounded by the Chinese forces. All highways in the Changzi, Gaoping, Jincheng, and Tianjingguan areas have been completely destroyed by the Chinese army. Also, Zhang Mao besieged Taoxian, and the northern section of Guoxian and Xinxian, etc., are extremely important. In eastern Henan, the Japanese army in Kaifeng repeatedly attacked Zhongmu, but all failed. In northern Henan, the Chinese army attacked</p>
<p>Su-Wan: Since the beginning of the month, the Japanese army on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces has launched attacks on three routes: one route attacked Liuhe in Jiangsu northward and Tianchang and Lai'an in Anhui, one route attacked Gaoyou southward from Huaiyin in Jiangsu, and one route advanced southward along the railway from Bengbu. The Chinese army and the Japanese army engaged in fierce battles in the vast area east of the Jinpu Railway and west of Hongze and Gaoyou Lakes on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui. Another brave Chinese army attacked Xuzhou in northern Jiangsu, Gaoxu in southern Jiangsu, and recovered Liwangji in Shouxian County in Anhui, and defeated the Japanese army invading from Wuhu and Anqing, cutting off Japanese communication around Hefei and controlling the county town. In addition, a Japanese giant warship was sunk by the Chinese near Wuhu.</p>
<p>Gui-Yue: More than 2,000 Japanese soldiers along the Yonglong Road in southern Guangxi have launched attacks on Xianglu Ridge and Jiangzhou from Nanning and Suilu in the past week. The Japanese army attacking the Xianglu Ridge area was severely attacked by the Chinese army, resulting in hundreds of Japanese deaths. The Japanese army attacking Jiangzhou suffered extremely heavy casualties. In addition, more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers on the border of Guangdong and Guangxi attacked Naliang eastward, and were ambushed by the Chinese army at Changjiao Ferry. Many Japanese soldiers fell into the water and drowned or were killed. The Japanese army in Chao'an, eastern Guangdong, has repeatedly attacked various places in the west of the city, including Jiali and Guxiang, in recent days. The Chinese army killed many of them. The Japanese army in Longxiang, Xinjie, Fengyong, and other places near Guangzhou in southern Guangdong was annihilated by the Chinese army in the past week, and a large number of weapons and ammunition were seized.</p>
<p>E-Xiang: The Japanese army in the Xiantaozhen area on the border of Zhongtian and Mian counties gathered more than 1,000 troops in the past week and attacked Xiacabou southward. At the same time, a part of the Japanese army in Xiliuhe also moved. The Chinese army intercepted them on separate routes and fought fiercely for several days. Hundreds of Japanese corpses were left behind as they fled towards Nanhedu. The Japanese army near Yichang in western Hubei was also repelled in the past week. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army in eastern Hubei launched fierce attacks on Huanggang, Tuanfeng, and Huangshigang, capturing Laobahe Fang Gaoping in one fell swoop, storming into strongholds such as Huangshi Liang, and breaking through the Japanese defense line on the Shushan River. The Japanese army in Chang'anyi Lengshuipu and other places in northern Hunan has launched attacks on multiple routes in recent days. The Chinese army sent troops to intercept them, but the Japanese army failed. In addition, the railway in the Yueyang Chang'anyi area has been destroyed in multiple sections by the Chinese army and is now out of service.</p>
<p>Other: The battle results on various fronts are as follows: (1) The Chinese army in Shandong stormed into the Japanese stronghold of Juxian County, annihilating most of the defending forces, capturing many Japanese soldiers, and defeating more than 2,000 Japanese soldiers who invaded from Fenshan, Zhangqiu, Laiwu, and Weixian. (2) The Japanese army near Wuning and Hukou in northern Jiangxi has been repeatedly ambushed by the Chinese army and suffered heavy losses. (3) Japanese warships and soldiers harassed various places on the Zhejiang coast, including Ligang, Xiangshan Port, Haimen, and Changjiang Estuary, but were all repelled, and one Japanese warship was heavily damaged. (4) The Chinese army in Sui repeatedly attacked Guisui and Saxian, achieving considerable gains. The Japanese army in Anbei Guyang attacked the Chinese army, but was also defeated. Dong Ruigeng, Xie Shuwang, Wang Dega, Wang Zaichun, and other units in the area, numbering over 10,000 people, revolted at the same time, dealing a major blow to the Japanese army.

<h3>British Air Defense Strengthened - German Air Force Offensive Gradually Subsiding - Fierce Air Battles at the Thames Estuary - Southeastern England Suffers Widespread Bombing</h3>
<p>London: Although the scale of German air raids on London last night was not as large as in previous nights, widespread bombing was carried out on southeastern England. There was a period when no anti-aircraft gun fire or searchlight flashes were heard in London. Fires were caused by incendiary bombs in several areas of the southeast, but they were quickly extinguished. The central districts were undisturbed. A church in the central district was hit by a bomb. There were many people in the air raid shelter beneath, but fortunately, no one was killed or injured. A bomb also landed on a hospital, but no patients or staff were injured. According to a joint communiqué issued this morning by the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security, southeastern England encountered German air raids yesterday evening before it was dark, but the extent was not significant. Several bombs landed in the southwestern suburbs of London. German aircraft also dropped bombs in certain locations in Kent and Sussex, causing minor damage with no casualties. It is now known that a second German bomber was shot down by British fighter planes yesterday afternoon. British aircraft suffered no losses throughout the day. German aircraft activity at night seemed more widespread than in previous nights. Bombs fell in certain parts of the London area, with the eastern and southeastern parts being the worst hit. A city in northwestern England was also air raided, causing minor damage with slight casualties. Several houses were destroyed in southeastern England, and a small number of residents were injured. Elsewhere, there was slight damage with no casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: German officials admitted last night that the intensity of German air raids on London had greatly decreased by the end of the second week of Göring's personally commanded attacks on England. At the same time, German newspapers also voluntarily admitted that British aircraft had continuously attacked German bases in the English Channel area, which Germany used as bases for aggression, in recent weeks. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: A famous residence on Wimpole Street in London, where the great British poet Robert Browning courted Elizabeth Barrett Browning, was partially destroyed by German air raids on London last night. In the history of English literature, the story of the Brownings is also one of the most tragic love stories. A play called "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" refers to this event, and the residence is famous because of this play. Now, the former scene is half in ruins. It is said that several architectural experts are working together to prevent it from collapsing. The destruction of the house on Wimpole Street may be the biggest loss in London last night, because German aircraft were repeatedly repelled, and the entire city passed a relatively peaceful night. The number of German aircraft that penetrated London's strengthened air defense network and leaked in was greatly reduced. Although these German aircraft dropped many bombs and added a ring of fire to London, the time was greatly reduced compared to before. Although German aircraft formed groups and wreaked havoc in the four corners of England, the German aircraft over London were very few. The all-clear was lifted early on Sunday morning, much earlier than the previous night. Anti-aircraft shells formed a terrible wall of fire, coupled with specially trained British Air Force pilots, so when the third week of night air raids began on the capital, the enemy aircraft were eventually driven back and partially destroyed. However, the suburbs of London and the docklands were almost all hit. Bombs exploded at midnight, and the sound was terrifying. Several streets were destroyed, and it is expected that there will be many casualties. As for last night's alerts in London, they were only sounded twice. According to officials, many German aircraft were turned back before reaching London. A large group of German aircraft dropped their bombs on Surrey, and another large group abandoned their bombs at sea and fled. The Germans continue to use their direct bombing tactics on working-class areas. In a certain town on the northwest coast, the homes of the poor were heavily bombed, resulting in extremely high casualties. Officials recently stated that British bombers are stepping up continuous attacks on Calais, Dunkirk, and Boulogne. The British Air Force has also launched the largest offensive against German troop concentrations in France, because the channel is as flat as a mirror, and the German army may invade England. Also, according to officials, seven German industrial centers were bombed. (International dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: At about 8 p.m. on the 21st, German aircraft appeared over London again on time, making it the 109th air raid on London. British fighter planes immediately roared into the sky to meet the enemy. The sound of bombs exploding was faintly heard. In the evening, about 60 to 70 enemy aircraft flew towards the London area from the Thames Estuary. British fighter planes quickly took off to intercept them. Before long, the enemy aircraft fled. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: A communiqué from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security stated that before dusk yesterday, enemy activity was limited to a few aircraft disturbing various places in England. They only caused disturbance in a certain district in eastern London where a few bombs fell, hitting a factory and causing slight casualties. At noon, several enemy bombers flew towards London, but only reached the outskirts of London, and bombs fell in Surrey, causing minimal damage. In the afternoon, a British aircraft shot down an enemy bomber. In the evening, a squadron of enemy aircraft flew over the coast, a few of which reached London. Shortly after, another enemy aircraft attacked. Details of the battle are not yet known. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, an enemy bomber attempted to break through London's anti-aircraft fire net, but was shot down in a square in northeast London. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>The English Channel Weather is Clear, German Aircraft Sortie in Batches</p>
<p>London: Tonight, German aircraft attacked London twice again. This marks the beginning of the third week of the British capital's aerial siege. The weather in the English Channel is clear, which is favorable for the German invasion. Therefore, the atmosphere in London is tense. In this tense atmosphere, German aircraft braved the thunderous fire from underground artillery batteries, rushed to the skies over London, and dropped their bombs, their fierce flames still unabated. At the same time, Wales and southern and northwestern England were also air raided. The first night attack by German aircraft was repelled by British fighter planes specially trained for night combat, but during the second attack, several districts of London were hit by explosions. Shortly after dusk, 60 to 70 German aircraft divided into several squadrons of 12 aircraft each, flew to the skies above the Thames Estuary, but encountered the patrolling squadron of British fighter planes in the eastern suburbs of London. After a tenacious battle, the British aircraft, aided by a hurricane, forced the German aircraft to retreat. Thus, the first German attack was repelled by the British aircraft. The German aircraft also quickly fled, but did not fly back. Shortly after, they finally broke through the air defense and reached London. (International dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Dover: The weather here last night was still favorable for the German army to invade England. The English Channel and the North Sea were very calm. The moon was bright, with no wind or clouds. However, it is not known whether this situation will continue until dawn. Reporters from the United Press International witnessed German torpedo boats on the French coast last night being very active. Looking out from the shelter, the armed torpedo boats could be seen moving along the French coast towards the opposite shore of the English Channel. German aircraft also dropped bombs in southeastern England yesterday afternoon. German aircraft also flew over Dover last night. (United Press International dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>German War Report Claims Eight British Ships Sunk</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon's German war report stated that German submarines sank eight enemy ships, totaling 61,300 tons. Another submarine also sank eight enemy ships, totaling 35,700 tons. In total, 176,000 tons of enemy ships were sunk in two days. Our aircraft continued to bomb various parts of England day and night. Multiple locations in London and along the Thames River caught fire. The Royal Albert Docks and the West India Docks also caught large fires. Enemy aircraft attempted to break through the German air defense line but failed, indiscriminately dropping bombs on non-military targets. Two enemy aircraft were lost, and two of our aircraft are also missing. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to a German military expert, who spoke to a Haitong News Agency reporter in a supplementary war report, the German Air Force continued to attack England. The station west of the Isle of Dogs in London and other military targets were bombed, and large fires broke out in several places. An air battle occurred at the time, and several British aircraft were shot down. In total, German destroyers and anti-aircraft guns shot down 14 British aircraft. On the night of the 20th, German aircraft bombed shipyards, gas plants, and airports in London. British aircraft also raided western Germany at night, causing slight damage, killing 13 civilians, and injuring many others. German submarines attacked British merchant ships, sinking a total of approximately 80,000 tons. It is said that Lieutenant Brichelozte's submarine recently sank nine merchant ships, totaling 51,862 tons. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday afternoon, German aircraft continued to attack London. Many military targets near the Isle of Dogs were hit by giant bombs, causing heavy damage. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>French Channel Ports Suffer Fierce Air Raids - British Aircraft Bombing Becomes More Systematic - Large Numbers of German Ships Catch Fire</h3>
<p>A Certain Seaport in Southeastern England: The air raids carried out by the British Air Force on German invasion bases became more intense last night, which is rarely seen by observers. Over a distance of several miles along the French coast, British aircraft's incendiary bombs hit their targets, causing large fires. British aircraft flew back and forth in groups, so the sound of anti-aircraft guns was constant. Each squadron of aircraft was illuminated by searchlights as it passed. The Royal Air Force seemed to pay special attention to Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne this time. The sound of explosions in these places continued for as long as three hours. The British Air Force's method of bombing seemed more active and systematic. British giant bombers constantly dropped flare signals in the shape of parachutes to show the targets: dockyards, military supply depots, and large numbers of floating vessels concentrated in certain places. The density of British aircraft bombing made people feel that the fire was never interrupted. Only after midnight did it feel slightly quieter. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: According to coastal observers, the British Air Force launched the most intense bombing of French Channel ports last night. Bombing sounds could be heard and fires seen along many miles of the coastline. Flares, shooting stars, incendiary bombs, searchlights, and the flames of burning houses illuminated the sky, shining brightly, and the sound of bombs and shells exploding formed a spectacular scene. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry Information Office stated that the port of Dunkirk had been heavily bombed before, and was attacked three times again on Friday night, each time lasting about an hour. The third attack was before dawn on Saturday. Its targets were a large batch of ships berthed in the two shipyards. British aircraft attacked through the clouds, dropping bombs on the basin and nearby canals, because many ships were also gathered in the canals. Fires broke out in many places along the river. Around midnight, a stretch of wharves between Calais Harbor and the eastern basin burned fiercely. Boulogne was attacked repeatedly from 10 p.m. on Friday night to 3 a.m. on Saturday morning. A large number of flat-bottomed boats in the channel mouth and the basin were hit by bombs and exploded. The Flushing port was attacked for three hours. Multiple places in the shipyard were hit by bombs and caught fire. The oil pools and gasoline storage depots in Ostend caught fire. British aircraft flew low to drop bombs, and a large supply ship must have been hit. The shipyards and ships in Zebrugge, Hingfanville were hit by many bombs. The land artillery there counterattacked with great force. The coastline from Cherbourg to Hamburg, which is 800 miles long, where ports and shipyards are now occupied by the Germans, has been bombed for half a month. And the channel bases that the enemy intends to use to invade England were fiercely bombed last night. According to Reuters Air Force reporters, the enemy's anti-aircraft firepower has not diminished slightly. Since the British Air Force uses shipyards where ships are gathered as its bombing targets, it will continue to attack these invasion bases. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: British aircraft raided western Germany, dropping eight explosive bombs and forty incendiary bombs in a small village near the Moeur River, burning down several houses and many granaries and stables. A church in the Kalon district and many houses were destroyed. British aircraft dropped flares, knowing that what they were bombing was not a military target. British aircraft also dropped incendiary fragments. Because they were discovered early, forests and houses did not suffer significant damage. (Haitong dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Italian Planes Bombard, British Fortress in Egypt. British Planes Attack Italian Airfields</h3>
<p>Rome - According to a report from the Stefani News Agency's North African correspondent yesterday, after Italian troops occupied Barrani, the Italian Air Force targeted Marsa Matruh, the strongest British defense city in Egypt. Within minutes, the Italians dropped no less than fifty tons of bombs, destroying the fortress, station, and railways there. British anti-aircraft fire was sparse, so the Italian planes returned to base safely. (Hai Tong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Cairo - A British Air Force communiqué stated that British planes attacked the Menastir airfield in the western desert, causing heavy damage to enemy planes on the ground. An enemy plane, taking off, was struck by an exploding bomb, and it is believed the plane was destroyed. The motor transport team concentrated in Sidi Barrani was also heavily damaged by British planes. An enemy plane attacked Marsa Matruh, causing slight damage. In East Africa, British planes successfully attacked two locations within enemy territory, bombing enemy airfields twice. An enemy town on the Eritrean coast was also bombed, causing considerable damage. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Rome Talks Conclude: German Foreign Minister Returns to Berlin. Third Meeting Yesterday with Italian Prime Minister. Spanish Interior Minister to Visit Rome</h3>
<p>Rome - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop paid a farewell visit to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at 12:30 PM today. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano then hosted a farewell banquet for him at the golf club. Ribbentrop is scheduled to depart for home tonight. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome - Political sources believe that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will have a third meeting with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today, but official confirmation has not been announced. Ribbentrop will leave Rome later today or this evening, as official reports will state that Ribbentrop's "stay in Rome was brief." He is expected to stay only one or two days. Currently, Ribbentrop's visit to Rome has lasted four days, indicating that the content of the negotiations is exceptionally important, likely discussing the war against Britain and the new order in Europe and Africa. There are reports that Spanish Interior Minister Suñer will travel from Berlin to Rome, but Suñer returned to Berlin from the Western Front today and will only depart after Ribbentrop returns to Berlin, likely not arriving in Rome before the 24th. (Hai Tong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome - Regarding German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's third day in Rome, the official report stated as follows: "Yesterday, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop did not hold formal discussions with Italian dignitaries but only met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Tivoli, near Rome, dining together with a few others."

<p>Germany Plans to Invade North Africa</p>
<p>Berlin - Sources close to the German Foreign Ministry indicate that, based on the idea that Africa belongs to Europeans, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is now planning a new campaign in Africa. The strategy depends on the conquest of Egypt. It is said that, according to German strategists, once Egypt falls, the conquest of other parts of Africa, whether by military or economic means, will be easy. The reporter stated that the fall of Africa will closely follow the fall of Egypt. Semi-official sources claim that, according to the German Foreign Minister's plan, if Egypt does not resist the Axis powers, the country will remain an independent state forever.

<p>Western Newspapers Hint at Major Events</p>
<p>Madrid - Spanish newspapers today published articles discussing the Rome talks and Spanish Interior Minister Suñer's visit to Germany, hinting that major events are about to occur.

<h3>British Lord Privy Seal Optimistic About War Situation. Germany Losing Air War, Britain Confident of Victory</h3>
<p>London - Lord Privy Seal Attlee broadcast last night, stating that the expected invasion of Britain has not materialized. Hitler has failed to start his attack on Britain as he had anticipated, and the delay is only increasing the difficulty of his work. I speak with deep conviction, confident that the British people will win. The enemy's current air raids are not aimed at British factories, docks, or public utilities, but at destroying the spirit of the British people. Hitler has now suffered his greatest failure. I recently inspected several large factories, whose products are of great importance to our war effort. If Hitler could halve this production with all his strength, he could achieve a significant victory, but he has failed to achieve this goal because our workers are not threatened by him. I have also visited people whose homes have been damaged and lives endangered, and their words are consistent, indicating that Hitler has not defeated us. I believe that Britain's declaration of war was the turning point in the war. Germany's failure in the war means the tide has turned. We may face worse things in the future, and we should not be overly optimistic, but there is indeed reason to be confident. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Safety Measures During British Air Raids. New Regulations Enacted</h3>
<p>London - The British Ministry of Home Security and local authorities are devising methods to reduce the inconvenience caused by German bombing. From Monday, post offices will remain open after the first alert and before the second emergency alert. It is generally expected that residents who lose essential clothing due to air raids will now be fully compensated, without being limited to the previous compensation of £20 for clothing and £50 for furniture. One of the main plans is to add sanitary facilities and bedding to air raid shelters during the day for nighttime use. Areas vulnerable to attack with inadequate air raid shelters will have plans to transport residents at night to prevent night raids. Each team will transport residents in segments by private cars and buses to designated locations at set times, and they will return home the next morning. However, this method must be tested before implementation. Many people sleep and eat in underground train stations every night, and it is expected that the authorities will restrict this, allowing only those with nowhere else to go to use underground stations as air raid shelters.

<h3>Turkish Ships Ordered to Leave the Mediterranean. Serious Situation in Syria</h3>
<p>Budapest - According to rumors circulating in diplomatic circles here, Turkey has become the focus of the Balkan crisis. Turkey has now ordered all its ships to leave the Mediterranean. Ten days ago, a Turkish merchant ship, the "Chaikalin," was detained by Italian authorities in the Dodecanese Islands. Italy refused to release the ship, so Turkey took this drastic measure in response. Although the French Ambassador to Turkey assured the Turkish Foreign Minister that France would not cede its air bases in Syria to Italy, rumors strongly insist that Italy intends to seize Syria. Turkish military authorities are alarmed by the situation in Syria. Today, all Turkish newspapers issued warnings, stating that Italy's desire to dominate its southern neighbor is unacceptable to Turkey. It is rumored that the Turkish government considers French rule in Syria to be incompetent and greatly desires an independent Arab government. However, today, official sources indicated that the Turkish people would prefer French rule to Italian control. Today, an official announcement ordered all Turkish women aged 18 to 24 to join air defense units and learn how to use rifles and machine guns. It is generally believed that this measure is intended to conscript all able-bodied Turkish men into military service. (International News Service, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin - Today, German sources here acknowledged that British bombers are conducting systematic night raids on key ports and locations in German-occupied Western Germany. However, the Germans claimed that German aircraft heavily damaged British defenses, more than compensating for the British attacks. (International News, 22nd)</p>
<p>New York - Amk International Corporation Deputy Manager Schalburg stated here yesterday that he had learned that Hitler had abandoned his plans to invade Britain. He claimed that Hitler's strategy would undergo a complete change, and Hitler may launch campaigns in other parts of Europe. This major businessman also stated that Germans have lost thousands of lives while practicing in the Channel, preparing for an invasion of the British Isles, and many barges carrying German troops have been destroyed by British aircraft. (International News Service, 22nd)</p>
<p>Ankara - Sources with extremely well-informed contacts claim that Britain is now trying to turn Syria into a dispute between Iraq and Turkey. According to British sources, the Iraqi government has requested intervention in Syria from the Vichy government, with the aim of preventing the expansion of Italian influence in Syria. However, Iraqi diplomatic sources stated that the Iraqi government does not want to intervene in Syria, and this information is purely intended to cause unrest. At the same time, Italian diplomatic sources solemnly stated that Italy strictly adheres to the terms of the French-Italian armistice agreement and will not exceed its scope. British claims that Italy wants to obtain broader political and economic control in Syria than stipulated in the agreement are completely false. Turkish political circles and public opinion are now paying extraordinary attention to the Syrian issue, declaring that they will not allow it to become "a powder keg against Turkey."

<h3>Large Numbers of Korean Christians Arrested. Accused of Subversive Activities</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Semi-official Japanese sources from Seoul claim that on Friday, large numbers of Christian pastors suspected of rebellion were arrested throughout Korea. They are accused of secretly forming associations, engaging in subversive activities, spreading false propaganda, and showing contempt for the Japanese Emperor. It is said that no foreigners are involved, as official statements indicate that there is no intention to interfere with Christian doctrines and it is hoped that Korean Christians will recognize the needs of the times as members of the Japanese Empire.

<h3>European War Discussions (10)(1) - A Perspective on the Pétain Government</h3>
<p>The following is a report from the Christian Science Monitor's European correspondent:</p>
<p>France, once an independent democratic nation with formidable power, has now become a disarmed, occupied, defeated country, abolishing democracy and replacing it with a new regime imitating Fascism and National Socialism. This sudden transformation is not easy to understand, and it is even more difficult to explain where it is headed.</p>
<p>However, if we adopt a suitably reserved attitude towards this sudden change in France, we can perceive the general trend and mainstream of social and political thought in France during this critical period of survival. The conclusions we reach may help the world understand the dramatic shift in the country's attitude towards Britain, Germany, and Italy.</p>
<p>The changes in French concepts and its foreign policy can only be summarized as a "revolution." Superficially, this transformation seems to have no obvious basis, but in reality, it has its own roots, like other revolutions. These roots are the self-awareness of France in political and social aspects.</p>
<p>France's current transformation, turning from friend to foe with Britain and establishing a similar regime to Germany and Italy, although mutually cause and effect, should be viewed separately in reality. France's animosity towards Britain is a natural reaction to its defeat and the destruction of its fleet by Britain. Under these circumstances, French resentment towards Britain is not unexpected, as when one of the two major allies collapses, the other is bound to be resentful.</p>
<p>Moreover, the British government cannot escape blame for France's defeat. Britain was slow to implement conscription, resulting in no large number of reinforcements arriving in France, and the troops that were sent, along with important equipment such as tanks, were insufficient to counter the German blitzkrieg. The lack of aircraft was particularly crucial. All of this was caused by the British government's "business as usual" policy during the first month and a half of the war.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the foundation of the Anglo-French alliance was not very solid to begin with. The French prioritize reason and individualism, while the British are inclined towards collectivism and intuition. The differences between the two are vast, like driving north and south. Except for a few people in Paris and London, neither country understands the other's national character and spirit.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of French soldiers retreated from Dunkirk to the British Isles, stayed briefly, and then returned to France. They were all surprised by the new world of Britain and the British people's kindness, friendliness, and warm hospitality. One French soldier told a reporter: "The superficial differences in character and intelligence between the British and French people have been exaggerated. It would be a good thing if a large number of French people went to Britain to live for a long time, so that they could deeply understand the emotional connection between our two nations."</p>
<p>The fact that there is animosity towards Britain on the French side is undeniable. A reporter met one of the last British women to leave France, who had lived in France for 25 years and had a deep love for the French people. Only when she suffered indescribable panic did she flee France in a disheveled state. The woman recalled the tragic situation at the time, not distressed by her hasty departure, but truly pained that the French people she had loved for so long were ultimately intolerant of her because she was British.</p>
<p>As for the matter of France changing its political system, it is a great mistake to say that France's abolition of democracy is merely a manifestation of the disturbance caused by the defeat of the French army and the occupation of half of its territory. Authoritarianism has deep roots in French history, and today's transformation is the reappearance of this tradition of autocracy in its national institutions, which has never been completely eliminated.</p>
<p>This fact can be supported by the words of the authoritative French writer André Siegfried. Siegfried is a historian and professor of political economy, and is publicly recognized as the highest authority on the study of French political characteristics and social institutions. Siegfried once said: "The French Revolution, 150 years after the Declaration of the Rights of Man, has never been unanimously accepted by the French people. This is not a question of republic versus empire, but something with even deeper significance. In other words, it is the question of whether the French nation accepts the spirit of 1789, and 1789 is the true dividing line between the left and right wings in France. The number of French people who support the right wing is far greater than expected. Conversely, the number of French people, except for the working class and peasants, who purely support democracy and fully accept the spirit of the French Revolution, is surprisingly small."</p>
<p>Siegfried further explained that the essence of the spirit of the French Revolution lies in the affirmation that sovereignty belongs to the entire people, and that politics should be from the bottom up, not from the top down. This fundamental distinction between democracy and dictatorship has been the focus of political struggle in France for more than 60 years since the establishment of the Third Republic.</p>
<p>France held a vote on the form of government in 1875, and the decision to establish a republic was won by only one vote. If the heir to the throne had not insisted on using the Bourbon flag and opposing the red, white, and blue revolutionary flag, the result of the vote might have been different, and France might still be a monarchy today.</p>
<p>This does not mean that France is retreating towards an imperial system, but the French nation is now in a state of extreme mental confusion, and it is not impossible for the imperial faction to launch a coup. From ancient times to the present, France has always maintained a strong latent consciousness of authoritarian politics. In essence, the French believe that the people should be ruled, not self-governed, for their own benefit. French Head of State Marshal Pétain and prominent members of the cabinet, such as Deputy Prime Minister Laval, have already declared the demise of the French Third Republic, and the three constitutional bills passed by the National Assembly on July 10th this year also declared the abolition of the 1875 constitution on which the Third Republic was based. In other words, they have clearly acknowledged the existence of this authoritarian ideology in France. (End of this article)</p>

<h3>Various Circles Eagerly Hope for Tram Service Restoration. Labor and Management to Negotiate This Morning. Labor's Conditions Have Been Automatically Modified. Strike Order is Good, No Accidents.</h3>
<p>After the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company of the Public Concession's tram workers went on strike on the 20th, all tram lines within the concession were completely shut down. The only means of maintaining transportation were buses and rickshaws, and during this strike period, which coincided with consecutive days of rain, residents felt even more inconvenienced. Although the Concession authorities had sent representatives to mediate between labor and management, hoping for an early restoration of traffic within the Concession, the company believed that the four temporary resolution conditions proposed by the workers were excessively demanding and could not be fully accepted without modification. It also hoped that all workers would resume work first, so that the interruption of public transportation would not be prolonged, and then engage in consultations to resolve the situation. On the workers' side, they would only agree to resume work after the company authorities recognized the proposed conditions. Therefore, the two sides were deadlocked. Fortunately, the strike order was good, so no unfortunate events occurred. Although yesterday was Sunday, the company remained open as usual to facilitate worker representatives going to negotiate directly. However, no worker representatives were seen going. The two sides may formally hold negotiations today. The detailed information obtained yesterday is recorded below.</p>
<p>Negotiations Begin at 10 AM This Morning</p>
<p>After a renewed meeting on the 21st, all tram workers of the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company decided to send four representatives to the Suzhou Creek Road headquarters at 10 AM today (the 23rd) to meet with the company secretary, Bullock, to negotiate a resolution to the labor dispute. It is reported that the management side, due to the significant losses to both sides during the strike, welcomed the direct negotiations with the labor side. The Concession authorities and all relevant parties also hope that the labor and management sides will reach a satisfactory resolution in these negotiations and restore traffic within the Concession as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Labor's Conditions Have Been Slightly Modified</p>
<p>According to the reporter of the Da Zhong News Agency, some of the conditions requested by the tram worker representatives from the management today have been modified as follows: (1) The monthly wage increase of 15 yuan has been reduced to 13.5 yuan (i.e., 5 jiao per day reduced to 4.5 jiao), and the method of a daily allowance of 1 jiao and a rice allowance of 1.5 jiao has been cancelled. (2) Workers may not be dismissed without cause. (3) Wages will be paid as usual during the strike period. (4) The 21 mutual benefit conditions between labor and management must be negotiated within two weeks. According to the workers' side, these four conditions are the minimum requirements, and they hope that the management will accept them in advance so that work can be resumed as soon as possible.</p>
<p>General Rumors About the Cause of the Strike</p>
<p>According to a certain worker, when the company's general manager, Yi Wen, left Shanghai for Hong Kong in April, he told the workers that when the price of rice rose to 60 yuan per shi, a monthly allowance of 10 yuan would be given, and workers who did not take leave throughout the year could receive a bonus of 60 yuan. However, since Yi Wen left Shanghai, the price of rice has gradually soared, exceeding 70 yuan per shi, and the management has not fulfilled its previous promise. On the 20th of this month, when the labor side asked the management to agree to the four conditions it had previously proposed, the management only agreed to issue an allowance of 1 jiao and a rice allowance of 1.5 jiao, completely rejecting the other three conditions, which led to this strike. They expressed their regret to all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Labor and Management to Negotiate Today. Labor Proposes Preconditions</h3>
<p>The workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company have not yet received a satisfactory response from the management regarding the 23 articles on improving treatment that were previously proposed. In this autumn of high living costs, and stimulated by the tram workers' strike, they have once again made demands and scheduled direct negotiations between labor and management at the company on Connaught Road at 3 PM today. At that time, in addition to negotiating with the management based on the 23 articles, the following preconditions will also be proposed: a 50% wage increase, the company issuing one shi of rice per month, valued at 30 yuan, and issuing 2 dan of coal briquettes, valued at 8 yuan, etc.</p>
<h3>Isolated Army Camp Dispute. Responsibility Gradually Becoming Clear. Incident Caused by Misunderstanding, Resolution Expected. Specific Conditions Still Under Discussion.</h3>
<p>The dispute at the Isolated Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road is currently being peacefully resolved by the Public Works Department and Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan. A reporter from the Ping Ming News Agency inquired yesterday with the relevant authorities of the highest authority in the Concession. According to reports, after days of investigation, the truth has gradually become clear. It is said that the matter was entirely caused by a misunderstanding, and now, through the mediation of authoritative Chinese figures, the misunderstanding has gradually been dispelled, and a harmonious situation has been reached. The Public Works Department is now first sending doctors to treat the wounded soldiers of the Isolated Army, and then lifting the blockade of the Isolated Army Camp. However, the specific conditions for a peaceful resolution have not yet been agreed upon and are still under discussion. It is certain that mutual understanding will be obtained.</p>
<p>He De Kui Revisits Xie Jinyuan</p>
<p>Yesterday at 1:30 PM, Public Works Department Deputy Director He De Kui, accompanied by Colonel Hampe, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and Colonel Mann, Commander of the White Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, revisited the Isolated Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road to meet with Regiment Commander Xie. The meeting lasted approximately 40 minutes before He and the others left. Although the results of the discussion are unknown, it is widely believed that some progress has been made in resolving the situation. According to reliable sources, Regiment Commander Xie will uphold the strict position of a Chinese soldier, and based on the facts, and demanding concrete assurances (that similar incidents will not occur in the future), will engage in negotiations with the responsible parties of the Concession authorities and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps.</p>
<h3>Two Foreign Vessels Detained at Lirik Port. Gao Deng Wheel Refunds Tickets</h3>
<p>Shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang has stagnated since Japanese warships continuously shelled Shipu, the Gao Deng Wheel returned to Shanghai, and Moufu suddenly suspended its sailing to Shipu. According to Da Tong News Agency, passengers on the Gao Deng Wheel requested a refund of their tickets after returning to Shanghai. However, since the ship was unable to enter port, its losses were also substantial. A compromise was reached whereby the ship refunded one-third of the ticket price, and the matter was resolved. The Gao Deng Wheel has now unloaded its cargo onto the wharf, moored to a buoy, and is observing the situation before deciding its next move. Also, when the Gao Deng Wheel returned to Shanghai, it discovered that the Ellis Maller, Marie Maller, and Jiangsu Wheels were being monitored by Japanese warships while passing through Lirik Port, making it difficult for them to return to Shanghai and resume sailing in the short term. The owners of the three ships have already telegraphed their Shanghai companies yesterday and requested the British Consulate to make representations to the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association to Hold Second Annual Meeting. 5 PM This Afternoon.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association at No. 41 Chi Bang Road in this port is the only charitable organization in Shanghai that provides relief to tuberculosis patients. It has been established for two years, and its president is former ambassador to the United States, Shi Zhezhi. The people handling various matters are also charitable figures and well-known doctors in Shanghai. The second annual meeting will be held at the American Women's Association on Jing'an Temple Road at 5 PM this afternoon, with refreshments, speeches, music, and other programs. The speakers include Dr. Litt of the Lei's Research Institute in this port. The participants in the music program include students of Professor Zhao Meibo. It is reported that more than 100 people will attend.</p>
<h3>The Power Company to Increase Surcharges Again Next Month: 19.21% Increase for Electric Lights, 74.86% for Other Electricity</h3>
<p>Due to the unpredictable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Shanghai Electric Power Company of the Public Concession previously stated that the original electricity rates were difficult to maintain. Therefore, with the approval of the Public Works Department, it began to levy monthly surcharges on user electricity bills from April. Yesterday, another announcement was made regarding a further price increase. The original text stated: "With the agreement of the Shanghai Municipal Council and this company, for ordinary users whose electricity consumption period ends in October of this year, the following temporary surcharges will be added to their bills: (1) Electric lights: 180.97% (Compared to 170.93% in July, 153.35% in August, and 161.76% in September, the actual increase is 19.12% compared to September, returning to the level of June); (2) Ordinary power, electric heating, cooking, and water heating: 355.87% (Compared to 250.43% in July, 185.15% in August, and 281.01% in September, the increase is 74.86% compared to September)."</p>
<h3>New Japanese Consul Arrives in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>The outgoing Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Yoshiaki Miura, after being transferred as Minister to Mexico, the newly appointed Consul-General Kaneki Horiuchi, departed on the Taiyo Maru on the 21st and will arrive in Shanghai at 12:00 noon today. Also traveling with him is the newly appointed Consul-General to Hong Kong, Ryuji Ito. After arriving, he will proceed to the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai to take over. Miura has already completed the internal handover matters and will take a ship on the 26th to leave Shanghai and go to Mexico to take up his new post.</p>
<h3>Tribute Rice Arriving Steadily: Only a Small Portion of Ordered Rice Has Arrived; If Shipping Continues, More Can Be Transported</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that although the situation in Vietnam is tense and uneasy, rice shipments to Shanghai continue to arrive steadily. 25,000 bags were shipped on the 20th, and another 18,000 bags arrived on the 21st. All of these are Saigon rice and have been unloaded. According to reliable sources, a large amount of foreign rice was ordered in the city in the past two months. Only a small portion of the orders have arrived recently. If the shipping between Shanghai and Haiphong is not hindered by sudden changes in the situation in Vietnam, a large amount of foreign rice will continue to arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Promoting Group Purchases</p>
<p>Group purchases of foreign rice are necessary. If they are widely promoted, the rice reserves in the Shanghai market will become more abundant. This way, large households will not compete with ordinary people in the market, and prices will easily return to normal. The procedures for group rice purchases are very simple. Any organizations, institutions, companies, factories, shops, or firms wishing to participate in ordering foreign rice can go to Room 311, 3rd Floor, YMCA, Eight Immortals Bridge, to obtain an application form. Fill it out according to the instructions, sign and seal it by the responsible representative, and submit it to the designated collecting agency, the Trust Department of the Jin Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road. Pay a deposit of 40 yuan (National Currency) per bag of rice to the bank and obtain a receipt. After the association receives the application, once a considerable quantity has accumulated, it will check the market price of foreign rice, and the purchasing committee will take the most appropriate method and entrust a foreign firm in this city or directly order from abroad. The ordering contract will be signed directly with the firm, and the ordering party will be notified of the price the day after the contract is signed. As soon as the goods are shipped to the port, the payment and delivery will be notified.</p>
<h3>Domestic Postal Rates Increased: Shanghai Bureau Implements Today; No Increase for Items Delivered Before 6:30 AM</h3>
<p>The increase in domestic postal rates has been set to take effect today. However, the Shanghai Bureau's early implementation on the 23rd has attracted attention from all walks of life. (According to the Ministry of Transportation's drafted plan to increase rates, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan, it was scheduled to take effect on October 1, 1940.) A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited a responsible person at the Shanghai Post Office yesterday to clarify the situation. According to reliable sources, the administration of this bureau has been rumored to be taken over by the "Aesthetic Viewpoint" after the withdrawal of the Chinese army to the west, but this is purely a rumor and not credible. The head of postal affairs in this bureau handles postal affairs in accordance with the government's intentions. The increase in domestic postal rates this time</p>
<p>was ordered by the Kunming General Bureau, which stated in its order: "Implement immediately upon arrival," without specifying any date. Therefore, this bureau rushed to complete the procedures upon receiving the order and implemented it early on the 23rd. It seems that external rumors are misunderstandings and are not surprising.</p>
<p>Delivery Time</p>
<p>The increase in domestic postal rates in Shanghai City will officially take effect on the starting date. Citizens submitting various postal items must affix postage according to the new regulations. Otherwise, it will be considered insufficient postage, and the post office will return the original item for additional postage or urge them to purchase sufficient postage. According to a senior postal officer at the Shanghai Post Office yesterday, any letters that citizens deposit in nearby mailboxes or post offices before 10 PM on the 22nd, if received by the post office before 6:30 AM on the 23rd, will be considered as delivered on the 22nd. All deliveries on the 13th must be before 6:30 AM, otherwise, new postage must be affixed.</p>
<p>Additional Fees and Supplements</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency inquired at the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday morning. In addition to the increased fees for various types of mail, there are also (1) insured parcels: an insurance fee of 8/1000 of the insured value (insurance fee starts at 8 cents) will be charged. For Sichuan, an insurance fee of 32/1000 of the insured value will be charged, starting at 16 cents. (2) Notarized letters: in addition to the registered or express postage and return receipt fee, a notarization fee of 1.60 yuan will be charged for every 100 words or fraction thereof. (3) Inquiry or reissue of return receipt: 26 cents per item. (4) Poste restante: 8 cents per item. (5) Withdrawal or change of address: 32 cents per item. (6) Change of COD amount: 21 cents per item. (7) Fee for viewing a copy of a notarized letter held at the post office: 8 cents per item per viewing. (8) Return receipt: 13 cents per item. (9) Inquiry or additional collection of return receipt: 26 cents per item (the above eight and nine items apply to Japan, Korea, Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, etc.). (10) Documents with printed or embossed words or patterns used by senders: 4 cents per kilogram. (11) Return receipt: 24 cents per item. (12) Inquiry or additional collection of return receipt: 48 cents per item (the above only apply to Macau and the leased territories).</p>
<h3>America Will No Longer Tolerate the Far East: Knowing That Empty Words Are Useless, It Decides to Take Practical Action</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" yesterday published a commentary by the well-known observer Woodhead, stating that Japan's actions in Vietnam and the possibility of Japanese military intervention in the Dutch East Indies have finally made the US government realize the dangers of adopting a laissez-faire policy towards the Far East. Although the US government has repeatedly protested against Japan's actions in East Asia, and the notes that Tokyo has not replied to are piled up like mountains, the most important posture is the concentration of the US fleet in the Pacific. In the past few months, the US fleet has been using Hawaii as a base. If there is no unexpected crisis in the Atlantic that forces all or part of the US fleet to be transferred to that ocean, the headquarters of the US fleet will be stationed in Pearl Harbor indefinitely.</p>
<p>Empty Words Are Useless to America</p>
<p>The concentration of the US fleet in the Pacific initially caused turmoil in Japanese official circles and even had a temporary restraining effect. But now it is commonplace. Judging from the current situation, it no longer has much impact on Japan's recent plan to expand the "Greater East Asia" new order. If the US government had accepted the British proposal last year to use the Singapore naval base and send a part of the fleet there to strengthen its presence, the situation would be different. Although the US government vehemently protested against the blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Yunnan-Burma Highway, blocking the transport of goods to Free China, when Britain and France sounded out Washington's reaction to Japan's demands, the US attitude did not show a substantial response.</p>
<p>Recently Awakened</p>
<p>Some American newspapers, disregarding the hardships of Britain and France in Europe, arbitrarily criticized the two countries for adopting the so-called Munich appeasement policy in the Far East. In fact, almost all of the transportation benefits provided by the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Yunnan-Burma Highway were for American trade. Then, do the American newspapers mean that Britain and France should risk a conflict with Japan to ensure the continued flow of American goods into Free China, while the United States itself is not responsible for supporting Britain and France in any way? The Washington dispatches of the past few days have shown that the US government has realized the dangers of its "spiritual" attitude.</p>
<p>Engaging in Practical Discussions</p>
<p>It is said that Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador to the US, Lord Lothian, and Casey have had long discussions on the issue of protecting British, American, and Australian interests in the Pacific, and old issues have been revisited, intending to place the various facilities of the Singapore naval base under the control of the US fleet. The scope of the talks seems to cover all issues related to Britain, America, and Australia, including the situation in Vietnam, the status of the Dutch East Indies, and the issue of the Yunnan-Burma Highway embargo after the three-month period expires.</p>
<p>Taking Joint Action</p>
<p>From the US perspective, the most important of these is naturally the status of the Dutch East Indies. American merchants import large amounts of tin and rubber, as well as other goods, from the Dutch East Indies. The recent proposal made by Japan that if the Dutch East Indies wants to continue this trade, it must export crude oil, scrap iron, cotton, and dried fruit to Japan without restriction, meaning that Japan intends to completely control the exports of the Dutch East Indies, will inevitably arouse deep resentment from the United States. The general realists in the United States seem to have realized that protesting with empty words without practical action to follow does not benefit the United States. As a result of the Washington talks, Britain, America, and Australia may have the possibility of taking joint action against the invasion of Vietnam and the attempted interference in the Dutch East Indies.</p>

<h3>"Slot Machine King" Committed Seventeen Offenses: Claims to Be Chilean But Registers Property With American Consulate</h3>
<p>The "Slot Machine King," American Jew Jack La Eyre, was requested to be arrested by the Public Works Department's Director-General Filipo to the US Consulate in Shanghai for operating a gambling den. He was interrogated by the US Consular Court the day before yesterday (the 21st). Judge Haymick asked La Eyre if he admitted to "committing a crime" or not. According to American law, if a criminal admits to committing a crime, the judge</p>
<p>can immediately determine the sentence without debate, and the fine will be reduced. If the criminal does not admit to committing a crime, he will be given the opportunity to argue, but if the result is determined to be guilty, the punishment will be increased. It is understood that the reason for La Eyre's arrest is that he has committed seventeen crimes. If each charge is calculated as five years of imprisonment, the total is eighty-five years of imprisonment and a fine of US$17,000. La Eyre's defense lawyer told Judge Haymick that the defendant did not want to speak on the issue of admitting or not admitting the crime.</p>
<p>Please Have Judge Decide</p>
<p>The judge then announced that he recognized La Eyre's statement as an admission of guilt and ordered the defendant to present his defense. La Eyre claimed to be of Chilean nationality and not subject to the jurisdiction of the American court. However, La Eyre purchased properties in the area where roads were built across the border and registered them with the American Consulate for protection. Since La Eyre's arrest, the slot machine gambling in the cafes around Zhubao Road has disappeared.</p>
<h3>Demand for Money Not Met, Injury to Grandmother: Shen Qiusheng Sentenced to Three Months</h3>
<p>Shen Qiusheng (24 years old), the eldest son of Shen Xinkui, a wealthy local from Lane 774, Haining Road, demanded 200 yuan from his grandmother, Shen Zhang (66 years old), at 1:15 am on the 8th of this month. When his demand was not met, he brutally beat her to the ground and fled. Shen Zhang reported the incident to the Huijia Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest Shen Qiusheng. Shen Zhang was sent to the Women and Children's Relief Hospital on Xizang Road for treatment. Shen was sent to the First Special District Court. Because Shen Zhang did not appear, the defendant</p>
<p>Firmly Denied</p>
<p>claiming that his grandmother was his grandfather's mistress, which caused a quarrel with his wife. He was released on bail by order of the court and begged his grandmother to withdraw the charges. The day before yesterday, Judge Mitsushige came to court to investigate. Police attorney Zhang Tianyin stated that Shen Zhang was represented by her lawyer, Fan Gang, who testified in court that there was indeed an incident of violence due to an unfulfilled request for money, and that Shen Zhang was not her father's mistress, requesting further investigation. According to Shen Zhang, the defendant is the eldest grandson,</p>
<p>Recently Fond of Gambling, Always Asks Me for Money. Last time I gave him 400 yuan, the second time 300 yuan, all lost in gambling dens. This time he wanted to take 200 yuan again. When I refused, he grabbed a handful of my hair, punched my back several times, and I fell to the ground crying in pain, etc. According to his father, Shen Xinkui, etc., the defendant was downstairs when he beat his grandmother. Later, when he heard about it, he went to his mother's room, but his son was gone, and he saw his mother lying on the floor. The court said, "You are a father, you should teach him, you must not listen to him,</p>
<p>So Savage</p>
<p>Police attorney Zhang stated that Shen Xinkui had previously tried to drag him to the police station for another matter, but was stopped by his grandmother. Now he is assaulting his grandmother, which is extremely unfilial. When questioned, the defendant flatly denied beating his grandmother, claiming that he was being used by others and begged for forgiveness, while Shen Zhang asked for leniency and warned him not to be so barbaric in the future. Judge Jiang admonished him earnestly and sentenced Shen Qiusheng to three months in prison, suspended for three years, and ordered his father to take him back for supervision.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side, Together With the Police, Arrest Two Women</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 11 AM, personnel from the Japanese side, together with police officers from the French Concession police station, rushed to a certain address on Laurel Road, in a certain garden, and arrested two modern women from that address. Due to tight security, their names were unknown. It was only known that the arrested women were wearing white broadcloth coats, silk cheongsams, and high heels, and were completely modern women. The reason for the arrest is also unknown. When the Japanese personnel went to the police station, there were seven people in total, including two armed individuals, traveling in military vehicles No. 206 and No. 1079.</p>

<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Jia Jixian, from Shaoxing, 43 years old, has been working as a laborer at a certain truck company. The day before yesterday, the truck company dispatched a truck (registration number 17175) to Nanxiang to load wheat, and Jia also went with it. Yesterday morning, they returned to Shanghai. While the truck was passing through a certain place, it was suddenly stopped by the local self-defense force for inspection. However, the driver did not stop the truck, and a shot was fired, hitting Jia in the right back, without exiting. He returned to Shanghai at 8 AM yesterday morning and was taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment. His injuries are serious, and his life is in danger.</p>
<p>At 9 AM yesterday morning, the Hongxing Coal Stack at No. 139, Yangjia Sha, Haige Road, hired more than a dozen temporary laborers to move coal. Because the coal pile was too high, it suddenly collapsed, injuring coal laborer Ge Si (30 years old) in the head, Wu Dayuan (41 years old) in the head and face, Ji Sanzi (29 years old) in the north and left leg, and Wang Mao San (18 years old) in the forehead. All four were from Jiangbei and were hired by the Hongxing Coal Stack and sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Shareholder Meeting of the Dafang Hotel</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been disagreements among the directors of the Dafang Hotel in Zhengjia Muqiao, French Concession. Both sides have published advertisements in the newspapers. Pen Sword East also felt that the matter was of vital importance, so they scheduled a shareholder meeting to resolve the issue. Yesterday was the date of the shareholder meeting of the hotel. The location was in the Central Vegetable Society on Sima Road. 72 shareholders attended, representing 211 shares. The police also sent personnel to attend. After the chairman reported on the business situation and the purpose of the meeting, the shareholders re-elected the directors. The elected were Shen Wenqing, Chen Enpu, and seven others. Shen Bojiang and Liu Qiusheng were also re-elected as supervisors. That evening, a meeting of the new directors was held. The disputes among the old directors have now been resolved, so it should be possible to focus on developing the business in the future.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Lin Shenqing's Letter Regarding Hou Yun's Assault Case</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I am writing on behalf of my client, Ms. Ye Qi, who was surprised to see a correction letter from lawyer Yao Fuyuan on behalf of Hou Yunqing in the local news section of Shen Bao. The case of Hou Yunqing being sued for assault was heard by the Shanghai First Special District Local Court on the 14th of this month. The facts were confirmed, and the court sentenced him to a fine of 30 yuan as a warning (Case No. 539, Year 29). The news item published in Shen Bao on the 17th of this month, "Hou Yunqing Sued for Assault, Fined as Warning," was based entirely on facts and was in line with the duties of news reporting. Even if Hou Yunqing wanted to make a correction to the news, it should be limited to the scope and objective of the news. It should not be allowed to use the solemn status of the news to fabricate irrelevant reasons and make malicious attacks at will, in order to confuse the public, which is obviously defamation. If Hou Yunqing is not satisfied with the court's judgment, he can handle it according to the law. It cannot be washed away by unilaterally using the newspaper to confuse the public. I can hardly remain silent about Hou Yunqing's opportunistic and obstructive actions. I am specially requesting the Shen Bao to make a correction in a prominent position in order to maintain the authority of the judiciary, the dignity of public opinion, and the reputation of individuals. Sincerely, Lawyer Lin Shenqing.</p>

<h3>A Perspective on London Newspapers During Wartime</h3>
<p>The British have always respected freedom of speech. Even during wartime, with the exception of certain news items related to military affairs that must be supervised by the government, the spirit of the press remains consistent. This is somewhat different from autocratic Germany, where the government controls newspapers and publications. However, many daily newspapers in London, although not entirely privately owned, and while many inevitably support government policies, none have a business relationship with the government. A brief account of the situation of London's daily newspapers is as follows:</p>
<p>The oldest and most historic newspaper in London is The Times. Strangely, it has the smallest circulation, around 200,000 copies daily. Although it has fewer readers, they are all influential. The power of this newspaper lies not in the number of readers, but in their status.</p>
<p>The Daily Telegraph is the second largest newspaper in London. It merged with the Morning Post three years ago. Its founder was Lord Camrose, who is also a shareholder in a printing company that publishes one hundred newspapers and magazines across the country. The Daily Telegraph now has a daily circulation of approximately 800,000 copies.</p>
<p>The Daily Sketch is a small-format newspaper. The chairman of its publishing company is Lord Kemsley, also of the Camrose family. He also publishes the Sunday Times and founded ten other newspapers published in various rural areas. The Daily Sketch and another small-format newspaper called the Daily Mirror are both considered newspapers read by women. They feature many illustrations and sensational news, with daily circulations exceeding one million copies.</p>
<p>The News Chronicle is the result of a merger between the Daily News and the Daily Chronicle. The Star Evening News, with a circulation of 450,000 copies, is considered the second largest evening newspaper in London and has a collaborative relationship with the News Chronicle. The News Chronicle has a circulation of 1.5 million copies, and because it has no party affiliation, it is willing to criticize the government.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail is the most reactionary newspaper in London. During the Abyssinian War, it supported the Italian invasion. It supported the now-imprisoned British fascist leader Oswald Mosley and was the first newspaper to publish "Heil Hitler." However, it has now abandoned its pro-Nazi policy and joined the national unified action. Its circulation is around 1.5 million copies. The Evening News is the largest evening newspaper in London and is its sister paper.</p>
<p>The Daily Express has the largest circulation among daily newspapers, reaching approximately 2.5 million copies daily. The Evening Standard is its sister paper. The Daily Express's large circulation is partly due to its sensational news and partly perhaps due to the prizes offered to its readers. However, its political views are quite independent. The Evening Standard often publishes the most scathing satirical cartoons of dictators, created by the talented artist David Low. During the years when the British government was carefully avoiding offending Hitler and Mussolini, he never ceased to expose the aggressive ambitions of these dictators to the public. He was also never polite to Japan. In 1934, he drew a cartoon titled "Japan's Domination," indicating that because Anglo-American naval cooperation had failed, Japan intended to dominate the Pacific. It is truly commendable that he could exercise freedom of speech so vigorously in such an adverse environment.</p>
<p>The Daily Herald is the newspaper of the Labour Party, with a circulation of two million, which it has maintained for the past seven years. Although many criticize it for being too pink, most workers, except for communists, read this newspaper.</p>
<p>The Daily Worker is the newspaper of the Communist Party. It started as a small, poorly printed newspaper and gradually developed into a six-page publication. Its circulation is small, and its advertising revenue is even smaller, so it cannot sustain its publication. However, its readers and party members freely donate, averaging over two thousand pounds per month. The chairman of the editorial board is Professor Haldane, an expert in air defense. His wife traveled to China two years ago to visit Chinese women.</p>
<p>The situation of the Daily Worker shows that in a democratic country, freedom of speech is unrestricted. It criticizes government policies almost daily. It has always expressed sympathy and support for China. At the beginning of the European war, some people in society inevitably complained about its editors because of the relationship between Russia and Germany. But now its stance is clear. It attacks the Nazis, but it is not exactly polite to the British government either.</p>
<p>Although the British government now cannot allow speech that is harmful to the country or affects the war situation for the sake of public safety, it will never interfere with the freedom of speech enjoyed by the people in newspapers and magazines. (ZY)</p>
<p>A Bandit Attempts to Rob a Doctor; Gun Discharges and Injures Someone; Six Robbers Flee in Panic at the Sound of the Shot; Victim Zhong Juemin Fortunately Suffers No Loss</p>
<p>At Dr. Zhong Juemin's clinic at 166 Avenue Haig, at around 10:30 AM yesterday, a bandit wearing a Zhongshan suit arrived for treatment. He first asked the registration clerk (Zhong's third daughter, Zhiyu, only fifteen years old) about the consultation fee. The clerk replied that the initial consultation fee was three yuan in legal tender. Upon hearing this, the bandit pretended to take money from his side, but instead pulled out a pistol and threatened the registering Miss Zhong and four or five other patients, preventing them from moving. At that time, five more bandits entered from outside, dressed in various styles. Another bandit also drew a gun and spoke menacingly. The bandit in front, whose gun suddenly discharged, fired a shot. The bullet left the barrel and struck a patient named Chen Zhibiao in the right leg, causing him to bleed profusely and collapse. The bandits, seeing that they had caused an accident, fled through the door, resulting in no losses. Zhong immediately reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. An ambulance was then called to rush the injured man to Baolong Hospital for treatment. It is reported that Chen is from Shaoxing, sixteen years old, residing at 31 Rongren Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession, and is a student at a certain middle school. The bullet had not yet exited the wound and was later surgically removed by a doctor.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Education Department Subsidizes Rice and Grain for Elementary Teachers; Monthly Subsidies Determined by Salary; Calculated for Twelve Months of the Year</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Airmail) The Guangdong Provincial Department of Education, due to the high prices in the province, has found that the salaries of general elementary school teachers are no longer sufficient to maintain their basic living expenses. The department has formulated provisional measures for local subsidies of rice and grain for elementary school teachers in order to solve the livelihood problems of teachers in the province and has issued them to the entire province for compliance. The main points of the measures are as follows: 1. If the salaries of elementary school teachers cannot be accurately distributed and implemented in accordance with Articles 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 of the Implementation Measures for the Distribution of Elementary School Teachers' Salaries, the school may apply to the county or city government for approval to provide elementary school teachers with food and lodging in accordance with Article 7 of the Measures for Food and Lodging for Elementary School Teachers, and negotiate with children's parents to subsidize elementary school teachers with rice and grain. 2. The amount of rice and grain subsidy for each teacher per month shall be determined according to the amount of salary, ranging from one to three shi (斗) of rice and two to six shi of grain. In areas where staple foods and miscellaneous grains are commonly used, this ratio should be used for calculation and may also be adjusted according to local conditions and the actual treatment of elementary school teachers, in accordance with Articles 4 to 7 of the Implementation Measures for the Distribution of Elementary School Teachers' Salaries and increased proportionally. 3. The rice and grain subsidies for teachers shall be calculated from August to January of the following year for the first semester of each academic year and from February to July for the second semester, for a total of twelve months of the year. 4. The amount of rice and grain subsidies and the exact number of households assigned or recognized shall be determined by public discussion between the township chief and parents, and then the list shall be reported to the county or city government for record. 5. The rice and grain subsidies for teachers shall be delivered to the teachers by the 20th to 25th of each month. 6. The accounts and actual conditions of rice and grain subsidies for elementary school teachers in various localities shall be inspected by county supervisors or district education instructors at any time to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>Charity Basketball Challenge Encountered Obstacles; Paramount to No Longer Participate; Intolerable Audience Disruptions; Difficult Childcare Institute's Yuan Lvdeng Will Mediate</h3>
<p>The Charity Basketball Challenge, which aims to raise funds for the Difficult Childcare Institute, has received sponsorship from all walks of life since its launch. The previous match against the Shanghai Stars created an unprecedented spectacle in the past two years. Unfortunately, a small number of ignorant spectators, unfamiliar with basketball techniques, misunderstood Paramount's slow-attack strategy as deliberately delaying the game and added "boos." Once a word was uttered, many blindly followed, creating a huge uproar. It should be known that this kind of slow-attack strategy is one of the most difficult basketball techniques and is sufficient to demoralize a strong and aggressive opponent and achieve victory. An ordinary team would hardly be able to use a slow-attack strategy, as it relies on tacit cooperation to deliver a smooth performance. Those who do not know better regard it as lacking excitement and add boos that border on insult. Such behavior is inappropriate in a championship match and even more so in a charity performance. The teams participating in this Charity Challenge have not only exhausted their physical strength but also spent money, enthusiastically engaging in a righteous act. All parties should be respected, and the order of the stadium should be jointly maintained. Paramount has bravely spoken out for difficult children, regardless of the exhaustion of physical and material resources. To their dismay, they were ridiculed by the audience twice, especially on Thursday night. Paramount could not bear it any longer, and their enthusiasm has turned to disappointment. They deeply regret the actions of a certain player that bordered on violence and were intended to cause harm. Therefore, yesterday, the person in charge of the team stated that they had sent a letter to the Difficult Childcare Institute, declining the subsequent four challenge matches. However, they will compensate for the tickets of these four matches with the highest income record from the previous night's match against the Shanghai Stars, in order to not betray the original intention of fundraising and affect the income of the charity. The person in charge of the team also solemnly declared that Paramount's painful refusal this time actually contains a feeling of helplessness and serves as a spiritual warning to those who act violently and the few ignorant spectators. Paramount's notification letter was sent out last night, but it is reported that Director Yuan Lvdeng of the Difficult Childcare Institute has decided to personally mediate in order to ensure that the charity event does not stop midway.</p>
<h3>Guangshi Basketball Game Hindered by Rain; Shanghai-Chongqing-Sichuan Joint Team Matches Not Played</h3>
<p>The Guangshi Cup basketball tournament originally had many matches and exciting programs, such as the women's group match between Qixiu and Jingwu, and the Group A match between the Shanghai-Chongqing team and the Sichuan joint team, all scheduled for the afternoon. Unexpectedly, they were hindered by relentless autumn rain, so only the four matches in the morning were completed, and all afternoon matches were postponed. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Chansheng vs. Citibank (University): Both sides forfeited</p>
<p>Huabu wins vs. Chenyou (Guang): 32 to 23</p>
<p>Lianyi wins vs. Lianyi (Group B): 49 to 15</p>
<p>Lingyou wins vs. Sichuan Joint Team B (Guang): 34 to 14</p>
<h3>Charity Table Tennis Also Underway</h3>
<p>Recently, enthusiastic people in the sports world, for the purpose of providing food and winter clothing for more than 600 difficult children in the Difficult Childcare Institute, have launched various charity matches. In the field of table tennis, Director Yuan Lvdeng and Director Pu Jiting of the Difficult Childcare Institute, due to the exhaustion of the institute's funds, have appealed for a grand charity table tennis performance, entrusting Chen Linsheng, director of the Shanghai Table Tennis Association, Liang Jintang, director of the sports department of the Xu Duo Jingwu Sports Association, Fu Guiqing, member of the Silver Dollar Cup Committee, and Pan Hongding, Cheng Zhiliang, and Jiang Shilin, the general managers of the institute, to be responsible for the event. Mr. Yuan will personally sign letters of appointment, inviting celebrities from all walks of life, including Mr. Yuan and enthusiasts in the table tennis world, to serve as committee members in order to jointly plan the event. The list of committee members will be announced in the next few days. As for the player lineup, it is planned to invite all of the city's first-class male and female table tennis players to participate in the performance. It is expected that the upcoming event will cause a sensation throughout Shanghai and create an unprecedented spectacle in the table tennis world. Table tennis has become very popular in recent years, and audiences have a deep love for table tennis. There have been no less than seven or eight table tennis charity matches after the war, and each has caused an unprecedented sensation. The preparations for this event, as well as future gains, should be no exception.</p>

<h3>Handling Idle Capital and Combating Speculation</h3>
<p>— Sun Liyu</p>
<p>Recently in Shanghai, idle capital has been excessive, and speculative markets have become prevalent. Foreign exchange, gold, stocks, and other major commodities have all become targets of speculation. Sometimes there are sharp rises and falls, and hoarding of goods, which not only endangers legitimate business, but also directly affects people's lives. It is permissible to say that at a time when foreign exchange is shrinking rapidly and prices are soaring, even those with some assets who are content with their lot often engage in some speculation to earn a small profit. Speculation itself has the effect of attracting speculation. After the wind of speculation prevails, all the people are forced into the vortex. Now the whole of Shanghai resembles a large gambling house. Not speculating seems to be out of touch with the times. This is a terrible phenomenon that should be rectified as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Everyone attributes the rise of speculation in Shanghai and the chaos of the economic situation to the excess of idle capital. Therefore, the attack on idle capital is very fierce. In fact, the phenomenon of excessive idle capital does not necessarily lead to rampant speculation. On the contrary, when the value of currency is relatively stable, it can often be used to promote industry. Because idle capital is abundant, interest rates must fall accordingly. Under such favorable conditions of low interest rates, various industries are more profitable in terms of calculation than before, and development must be easier. Therefore, idle capital itself is not necessarily a monster that stirs up trouble. If used properly, it can achieve good results. On this point, most people who care about the economy are already clear. After the National Army withdrew to the west, informed people loudly appealed, demanding that Shanghai's idle capital be invested in the western provinces to develop resources and create prosperity in the interior. The government also regarded this as a priority, striving to encourage and implement various policies to attract the flow of idle capital inward. However, things did not go as desired, and the amount of idle capital remaining in Shanghai was still huge. Its harm is even greater than in the past. Therefore, we must raise several questions: Why does idle capital gather in Shanghai? Why does the idle capital in Shanghai not engage in legitimate business and instead all go into speculation? Is there a way to combat speculation and guide idle capital to flow inward?</p>
<p>—— The Composition of Idle Capital</p>
<p>First, regarding the gathering of idle capital in Shanghai, we can find several reasons: (1) After the National Army withdrew to the west, most of the rich areas of China became war zones. Even if they did not suffer from war, they were mostly bombed. However, because of the existence of concessions in Shanghai, the interests of third countries were complex and intertwined, and the other party wanted to use this piece of fat on the chopping board as a relay station for military supplies and a dumping market for goods, so the status quo was maintained. For the sake of protecting their property, many wealthy families in the interior came to Shanghai with their assets to live as rentiers. This is the first major reason for the flow of idle capital into Shanghai. (2) After the outbreak of war in Europe, those who had previously escaped to various European countries also felt that foreign countries were not safe havens and returned with their assets. As the European war expanded, Holland and Belgium fell, and France ceased fighting. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, in view of the instability of the situation, also remitted large sums of money to Shanghai. Even capital fleeing to the United States gradually realized that the United States might participate in the war and dared not regard the US dollar as an object of credit, so those who remitted funds back home were also not few. This is the second major reason for the inflow of idle capital into Shanghai. (3) After Shanghai became an isolated island, the power of the Chinese government could not reach it, and Japan could not control it either. Thus, Shanghai became a free market. At a time when controlled economies are prevalent, it is by no means easy to find a free market like Shanghai. New York can be compared with Shanghai, but because of low interest rates and heavy taxes, it is mostly avoided by small and medium-sized capital. Moreover, Shanghai is a gathering place for merchants from all over the world and is extremely international. Therefore, it is not uncommon for small and medium-sized capital from neighboring countries to remit funds to Shanghai in order to seek freedom of activity. The Japanese side even had to promulgate laws to strictly restrict the circulation of Japanese yen funds, which is also sufficient to show the frequency of international capital flows in Shanghai. This is the third reason for idle capital to come to Shanghai. (4) In order to build the economy of the southwest and supplement materials in the interior, the Chinese government purchased a large number of goods in Shanghai. Although there are no statistics to verify the exact amount, the increase in the value of goods imported into Ningbo, Wenzhou, Fuzhou, and various ports in the southwest in recent months can give a rough idea. According to experts, it was about 300 million yuan in the first half of this year. After this huge sum of money flowed into the Shanghai market, it mostly formed idle capital. Due to the above reasons, Shanghai's funds have accumulated day by day, creating a phenomenon of excess.</p>
<p>However, funds are not flowing out without any outflow. Enterprising industrialists who invest in the southwestern provinces remit their surplus funds to the interior; importers who purchase goods from foreign countries must remit funds abroad in the form of foreign exchange; and people from European belligerent countries who are conscripted back home or donate to war expenses also remit their income from Shanghai to their home countries. In terms of trade alone, Shanghai's trade deficit in the first half of this year reached a huge amount of 15 million pounds. However, the amount of funds flowing out is far less than the amount flowing in, so the deposits of various banks have continued to increase. According to general estimates, the increase in current deposits of various banks in the first half of this year should be more than 100 million yuan. Combined with the previous deposits, the so-called "idle capital" totals as much as 300 million yuan.</p>
<p>The increase in bank deposits is a normal phenomenon, but now it is called idle capital because of the change in the nature of the deposits. In the past, Chinese currency had outstanding credit, and time deposits accounted for more than half of the deposits of various banks. Now, the increase in funds is all in the form of current deposits. As a result, the ratio of current deposits to total deposits has reached about 80 percent. This change in the deposit ratio conceals the root of rampant speculation.</p>
<p>Judgment of Idle Capital on Investment and Speculation</p>
<p>Speaking of the reasons why idle capital is not invested in industry, there are several points: (1) Although Shanghai has concessions, the future is not optimistic. Unless the profits are particularly high and the capital can be recovered in a very short period of time, it is not enough to arouse investment interest. Investing in the interior, although the profits are very considerable, on the one hand, there is the danger of being bombed, and on the other hand, there is fear that there will be no opportunity for free remittance of funds. Therefore, although capital is abundant, there is much hesitation about investing in industry. This is the positive reason why idle capital does not enter the right path. (2) China cannot control foreign exchange in Shanghai, so there is a black market for foreign exchange, and the exchange rate on the black market is gradually tightening due to the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese war. Other materials are also rising in price, which is an inevitable phenomenon in the course of the war. Shanghai's idle capital takes advantage of the lack of control as a good opportunity to speculate according to the trend of foreign exchange tightening and rising prices. Before the outbreak of the European war, whether buying foreign exchange or hoarding goods, huge profits could be obtained without thinking. Since the profits from speculation are huge and the risks are generally ignored, the meager interest or risky profits are not enough to induce idle capital into the right path. Even if factories are set up and production starts in Shanghai, the location is relatively safe, and profits are also considerable at a time when prices are soaring. However, according to the usual practice of rising prices, raw material prices rise faster than manufactured products, and it is also easier to sell raw materials. Therefore, setting up a factory to manufacture is often not as profitable as hoarding raw materials. This is not a frequent phenomenon, and of course it does not completely prevent capital from being invested in industry. In fact, 392 new factories were established last year. However, we can assert that the occurrence of this phenomenon is sufficient to make the capital attracted by speculation larger than investment. This is the negative reason why idle capital does not enter the right path.</p>
<p>However, speculation can never be smooth sailing, and it itself contains a self-destructive effect. After the outbreak of the European war last September, foreign exchange bulls had already suffered a severe blow. After the expansion of the European war this May, Shanghai was plunged into an unprecedented depression. At that time, exchange rates eased, and prices plummeted, and many people went bankrupt. Originally, in the process of the continuous contraction of exchange rates, the arrival of a general recession was quite strange. Some people thought that this was entirely the result of the expansion of the European war. However, in fact, excessive speculation in the past year and a half, with prices being raised, resulted in overproduction and excessive imports, and the price of goods had already contained the elements of collapse. Taking cotton yarn as an example, the average price of 20-count yarn in mid-May reached 1,700 yuan. Converted at the exchange rate at that time, it was more than 500 yuan higher than the price of Indian yarn. Under this high price, imports and production went hand in hand, but actual sales were still sluggish. Its price drop, of course, was to be expected. The expansion of the German-Soviet war and the return of escaped capital were just an opportunity. The decline in the economy has indeed given speculators a very good lesson, breaking their idea of enjoying huge profits, and at the same time hinting at the direction of handling idle capital.</p>
<p>However, the amount of idle capital is now even greater than before, and the atmosphere of speculation has not completely disappeared. In the past two or three months, although there have been no major changes in various markets, there have been several rumors every day. They are trying to stir up trouble with any excuse. Their extremely dynamic situation is obvious. Therefore, even when there is an excess of idle capital, market interest rates still maintain a fairly high rate. According to the statistics of the clearing house, the daily average amount of bill clearing in July this year was only 18.33 million yuan. Compared with July 1937 before the war, although the wholesale price index has risen from 129.1 (compiled by the National Tariff Commission, average for 1937) to 484.8 (this is the index for April, which has not been published in recent months, or slightly lower), the average amount of clearing has decreased by more than 8.04 million yuan. The stagnation of Shanghai's economic situation can be seen. However, the average interbank lending rate of banks in July this year was 28 cents, and the interbank lending rate of money shops was 20 cents, which is more than twice or more than twice as high compared with 11 cents and 10 cents in July 1937. This phenomenon, compared with the increase in bank current deposits, proves that Shanghai's idle capital is still waiting for an opportunity. If its activities are not suppressed by appropriate methods now, it will inevitably stir up trouble again when the international situation changes!</p>
<p>"Guidance" and "Attack" Should Be Planned and Considered Simultaneously</p>
<p>Then, what methods can be used to prevent idle capital from causing trouble again? The Chinese government has implemented various countermeasures for this purpose. On the one hand, it has arranged investment places in the interior to make idle capital flow inward so that it will not have no goal. On the other hand, it has opened bombing insurance and implemented interest-bearing measures to ensure the safety of capital. On the other hand, it allows Shanghai funds to be remitted and deposited in the interior, and interest can be collected in Shanghai, retaining the freedom of capital flow. Various methods of attracting idle capital are extremely complete. However, this policy is still too mild and not easy to be effective.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the stagnation of idle capital in Shanghai now is, as mentioned above, that the general public still believes that the benefits of speculation are greater than investment. If speculation cannot be combated to make them understand the risks of speculation, then even if we strive to attract idle capital to flow inward on the front, we will never achieve our goal. The world situation is now chaotic, and the risks of speculation are increasing. We are seeking to choose the best course of action. China's financial power is now largely in the hands of the state banks. If we can take this opportunity to implement surprise open market policies at any time, fight speculators with the power of the state, and give them a fatal blow, so that the general holders of idle capital will learn from the past and take speculation as a warning, and have no attachment to Shanghai, and promote an era in which idle capital automatically flows inward, we will surely achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>

<h3>Regarding German-Soviet Banks</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Chengzhao</p>
<p>Regarding your five questions, I am currently asking trade expert Wu Jingwo to draft a reply regarding the international trade system of the United Kingdom and the United States. The rest will be answered briefly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet Union does not have a purely private-capital bank system, but there are various cooperative banks. These banks are mostly part of a group of factories and farms. From the perspective of the national bank, it is a private bank; from the perspective of the private banks in general capitalist countries, it is a public bank. In fact, it is between a public bank and a private bank. These banks receive substantial assistance from the National Bank, and the State also specially establishes a Central Cooperative Bank to be responsible for supporting the development of these cooperative financial undertakings.</p>
<p>(2) Among the four major banks in Berlin, three are Guaranty Banks, namely Deutsche Bank und Disconto Gesellschaft; Commerz und Privatbank; Berliner Handels-Gesellschaft; The purely private ones with a shareholding structure have all been eliminated. The main relationship with the National Bank is the discount business. In accepting the instructions of the National Bank, its foreign exchange and lending businesses are coordinated with the policies of the State.</p>
<p>(3) For the application of free marks and blocked marks, please refer to the points asked by Mr. Liu Ying in the previous two issues.</p>
<h3>Review of Over-Profit Tax Relief and Relief Measures</h3>
<p>— Wang Wennan</p>
<p>Since the government successively levied income tax and excessive profit tax during the extraordinary period, and then implemented estate tax from July 1 this year, the direct tax system in our country has been largely completed. "This is a landmark facility in our country's financial administration, and it is really gratifying. Since the implementation of the excessive profit tax during the extraordinary period, the whole country has responded; all sectors of industry and commerce have enthusiastically paid taxes; all of this is enough to show their patriotism. According to the provisions of the Excessive Profit Tax Regulations: all enterprise profits that exceed 20% of their capital amount must pay tax on the excess; those within 20% of the capital amount are exempt from taxation. This tax exemption provision is already a true expression of sympathy for general industry and commerce. Now the government, in view of the fact that the operation of small industry and commerce is related to household livelihood, and at a time when prices are soaring, it must make its after-tax income more affluent in order to accumulate savings and seek development; secondly, in view of the fact that general profit-making enterprises are threatened by war and air raids during the War of Resistance, the loss of business assets cannot but be planned for in advance; now, in order to seek relief, the "Measures for Relief of Industry and Commerce and Relief of War Losses in the Collection of Excessive Profit Tax during the Extraordinary Period" are specially formulated, which are divided into seven items, which are attached below; (1) For industry and commerce with an annual profit amount of less than 5,000 yuan, an exemption of 600 yuan is allowed; when the business time is less than one year, the exemption should be calculated and deducted in proportion to the number of business days in one year; (2) For general profit-making enterprises, they are allowed to withdraw one-tenth of the profit amount each year as a reserve for offsetting air raid disasters, etc. The losses suffered due to the war are temporarily not taxed. (3) The prepared items should be waited until the end of the War of Resistance, or when they are merged, dissolved, closed, or liquidated during the period. If no loss has occurred, or after offsetting the losses of each year, there is still a balance, then the tax will be calculated separately for each year. (4) The business that has suffered war losses before the implementation of these measures shall be amortized annually in accordance with the provisions of the income tax laws and regulations. If the remaining balance that should be amortized has not been fully amortized this year, the remaining balance that should be amortized shall be first allocated to this reserve. (5) In the year when the War of Resistance ends, the preparation for this item should be stopped immediately. If the loss has not been fully compensated by the time, continued preparation is still allowed, but it should be deducted within one-tenth of the profit of that year. The amount of compensation for the loss is the limit, and if it is still insufficient, it should be amortized separately in accordance with the provisions of the income tax. (6) The taxpayer shall not use the above-mentioned preparation for profit distribution; when calculating the income tax, it shall not be used as a public reserve, and one-third shall be included in the capital calculation. (7) The relief measures stipulated in the first and second items of these measures shall not apply when calculating the business profit tax of temporary profit-making enterprises, and the relief measures stipulated in the second item shall also not apply to the profit tax of profit-making enterprises such as merger, dissolution, closure, and liquidation.</p>
<p>Looking at the provisions of the first and second items of the above-mentioned measures, it can be known that the tax exemption of 600 yuan and one-tenth of the war loss reserve are both deducted within the profit amount. However, when calculating the payable profit tax amount, there are questions that make people doubt: that is, when this tax exemption is deducted from the profit amount, is it before or after the war loss reserve is withdrawn? Although there is no explicit provision in the article, it is necessary to explain it; however, according to the provisions of the second item, general profit-making enterprises are allowed to withdraw one-tenth of the profit amount each year as a war loss reserve; it seems that the item is to withdraw one-tenth of the total profit amount; then the deduction of the tax exemption must be after the preparation is withdrawn, and then the excessive profit tax amount is calculated. In order to facilitate the review, the calculation methods stipulated in the original regulations of the excessive profit tax and the calculation methods of relief are exemplified separately to compare the amount of tax payable under the two methods.</p>
<p>(1) Suppose there is a China store with a capital of 10,000 yuan, and the business results this year are a net profit of 4,000 yuan, which accounts for 40% of the capital amount. According to the Excessive Profit Tax Regulations, in addition to the income tax that should be paid, the profit tax must also be levied. The calculation method is as follows:</p>
<p>(2) Now, the store's capital is still 10,000 yuan, and the net profit is also 4,000 yuan. According to the relief measures, it is allowed to withdraw one-tenth of the war loss reserve, which is 400 yuan, and deduct the tax exemption of 600 yuan. The remaining net profit is 3,000 yuan, which accounts for 30% of the capital amount. The calculation method of the payable profit tax amount is as follows:</p>
<p>"In the note, if the business time is less than one year, the tax exemption of 600 yuan can be calculated and deducted in proportion to the number of business days and the number of days in the whole year.</p>
<p>Calculation of the part of the excessive profit tax amount payable:</p>
<p>According to the above example, it can be seen that the China store calculates the excessive profit tax amount (125 yuan) according to the relief measures, which can reduce six-tenths of the tax amount (325 yuan) calculated according to the original regulations. In other words: for small industry and commerce with a capital amount of 10,000 yuan, if its annual profit is less than 5,000 yuan, the excessive profit tax amount calculated according to the relief measures can be reduced by more than one time, and the actual benefit is not small. As far as general profit-making enterprises are concerned, if their annual profit amount exceeds 5,000 yuan, although they cannot enjoy the treatment of the 600 yuan tax exemption, in fact, according to the relief measures, they are allowed to withdraw one-tenth of the profit amount as a war loss reserve, which is temporarily not taxed. Therefore, this reserve part is at least exempt from tax at present. Therefore, the implementation of the relief measures has benefited all industries a lot.</p>

<h3>The Recent Situation of Shengze Silk under the "Special Donation"</h3>
<p>When the newspaper was republished two years ago, the author wrote two articles in this column about the silk industry in Shengze. At that time, I pointed out earnestly that the silk industry in Shengze would gradually decline under abnormal development. Now, unfortunately, this sentence has been hit by what I said. The silk warp and weft goods are on the verge of collapse under the "control" and "special loss". The recent developments are to prove that this is inevitable.</p>
<p>Although my hometown Shengze is not a silk-producing area, the development of the Sheng silk weaving industry has a great impact on the silk warp and weft market. After the fall of the Sujia Road the year before last, the Zhenze warp and weft market moved to Shengze due to transportation reasons. At the same time, small silk factories and warp and weft firms were opened one after another, reaching as many as dozens. Therefore, Shengze in recent years can almost combine the silk-producing area and the silk-weaving area into one, presenting an unprecedentedly abnormal excitement. However, the good times did not last long. At the beginning of this year, silk warp and weft were first subjected to control in order to exchange for foreign exchange. The silk goods were also blocked due to the restriction of imports from Pingjin. Since the establishment of the "special donation for silk warp and weft" last month, the "special donation" for "direct woven finished products" of silk goods will also be "collected" soon. With such consecutive heavy blows, silk factories and warp and weft firms are shutting down and disbanding, and weaving households and silk merchants are giving up weaving and changing industries. Those who are still struggling now are either eking out a meager living, spending great efforts and thoughts to engage in adventure to find a way out, or surrendering to control and being slaughtered.</p>
<p>The so-called adventure to find a way out is actually very tragic. Since the cargo transportation cannot directly reach the concession, the British and American foreign firms have no way to intervene in the purchase of silk warp and weft. They can only indirectly trade with a certain merchant. Therefore, the general silk factories and warp and weft firms in Shengze, who are good at management, in order not to endure, try to smuggle the silk in bundles to the carrier, who avoids the eyes and ears of the controller of the transportation line in a fragmented way and secretly transports it to the concession for sale. These carriers are mostly unemployed raw silk brokers. The method of carrying was very secret at first, but soon became public because of the profit. One bundle of warp and weft is fifteen small bags. Each carrier is guaranteed by the cargo owner for 100 yuan for each small bag. After arriving at the destination, each small bag is paid a carrying fee of 25 to 30 yuan. In addition to more than ten yuan to buy off the joints and travel expenses, each small bag of warp and weft can earn more than ten yuan. There is absolutely no danger on the road and it is fast. Silk goods are naturally calculated in the same way. Under such a carrying system, the small silk factories and warp and weft firms in Shengze can barely survive in a helpless situation.</p>
<p>As for silk goods, because the sales in Shanghai are very limited, and since the cargo transportation from the southwest inland stopped, there were originally only two roads in Pingjin that still had considerable consumption. In April of this year, Pingjin restricted imports, and Sheng silk was also restricted. Local Hakka people who were more active could withdraw the goods as long as they spent money. Those who had no connections were given a lot of difficulties, and even the goods were confiscated. The Sheng silk dealers who undertook the business sometimes received letters from the Hakka family urging them to send the goods quickly, and sometimes they received notices to stop packing. Sometimes they had to send large packages, sometimes they had to change to small packages. Sometimes obstacles occurred in Beiping, and sometimes Tianjin stopped registering. Recently, they tried to change to Shandong and Hebei for transit. Under this unstable state, Sheng silk finally survived until now.</p>
<p>But now, the silk carrying method has been revealed, and the silk factories and warp and weft firms have been ordered to stop work and close down for destroying the autumn system, and even the principals have been arrested and sent to the "government". At the same time, the "special donation" for silk goods is about to be established, and the restrictions in Pingjin are becoming more and more strict. The post office has also stopped sending large postal packages to Shandong. The tragedy of the future is not difficult to imagine! (Junmei)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: It is Expected that Sugar Prices Will Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association's disk closing, the spot price of No. 24 coarse white opened at 80 yuan, and then continued to trade at 80.04 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan. The re-export goods opened at 64 yuan, and rose to 64.5 yuan, 65 yuan. Dutch cotton white TML mark 77.3 yuan, Dutch red TJD mark 62.7 yuan, small turtle mark 63.5 yuan, Taikoo B mark 77.5 yuan to 78 yuan, DY mark 74.5 yuan, 75 yuan, HX mark 75 yuan, HM mark 68.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Tapioca Starch Rebounds</h3>
<p>There is no shortage of tapioca starch arrivals, and the bottom accumulation is quite substantial. The previous market once showed weakness, but recently the demand has become active again, and the market has improved. At present, the Fei Qilin brand has been sold for 63 yuan, the KG brand for 60 yuan, the double T brand A and the Peacock brand for 53 yuan, the double T brand for 51 yuan, and the No. 3 powder for 47 yuan. The trend is gradually firming.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Not Many Orchid Bamboo Branches Arrive, Price Rises 5 Yuan Compared to Previous</h3>
<p>The second batch of orchid bamboo branches, 71 boxes, arrived on the Taiyuan wheel the day before yesterday. Because the traffic there has not fully recovered, the source is difficult to find for a while, so the opening price has increased, rising by 5 yuan compared to the previous market. All were sold at the opening price.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Abalone Shells Soar</h3>
<p>Shi Jue Ming, namely abalone shells, has no subsequent arrivals, and the market inventory is also lacking, so the opening price has become tight. The previous market opened at 55 yuan, and has now risen to 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Firewood Shops are Doing Well Due to Demolition</h3>
<p>The source of firewood has been cut off for a long time due to transportation difficulties. Although some merchants hired sailing ships to load, they were also obstructed by a certain party and were not allowed to pass, resulting in a thin market inventory and brisk demolition in the shops. Only the Huzhou gangs on the inside road have opened a little, mostly long chestnut and pine firewood, calculated by the catty. The same industry is dismantling at 4.67 yuan per 100 city catties. Dock queuing cars and carrying outside are extra.</p>
<h3>Textiles: Hailishi Flannel Becomes Popular</h3>
<p>Imported Hailishi flannel is quite expensive, creating an opportunity for domestically produced goods to become popular. This Hailishi flannel originated on Havvis Island in Europe, hence the name. Currently, imported Hailishi fabric costs at least 200 legal tender yuan to tailor a jacket or coat. Genuine single-width fabric costs around 300 yuan. However, using domestically produced fabric, whether for a coat or a suit, generally costs less than 100 yuan. A women's coat can be made for as little as 40 yuan. The "Santa Claus" brand of Meilun goods has seen numerous transactions because its manufacturing uses the traditional methods of Hailishi Island. Yesterday, the top-grade sold for 11.5 yuan, and the second-grade for 10.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals: Cement Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The cement market is experiencing low production and thin inventories, causing holders of goods to remain firm in their pricing. Prices continue to rise. Currently, the market price for "Horse" brand cement is 68 yuan per barrel, and 17 yuan per mother bag. Numerous transactions have been made throughout the city, resulting in a very tight market.</p>
<h3>Steel Ship Plates Slightly Looser</h3>
<p>The shipyards in this port have already taken eight or nine tenths of the 2.5 and 1-cent steel ship plates in the market, making business feel rather desolate. Additionally, the machine factories' outlets are also very sluggish, leading to only a few transactions throughout the day. Therefore, the industry is also in a weak state, causing quoted prices to loosen. For example, 2.5-cent plates are quoted at 75 yuan, and 1-cent plates at 50 yuan.</p>

<h3>Donating Old Clothes</h3>
<p>— Mei Zi</p>
<p>"Regardless of the family, there are bound to be some ill-fitting, outdated, or semi-worn old clothes stored away. From children to adults, families accumulate old clothes, so there will inevitably be some. Especially in bourgeois families, the remaining quantity must be considerable. Since these old clothes are no longer worn, leaving them unused is meaningless and they just take up space and become annoying.</p>
<p>The Cold Weather Clothing Collection Committee has a rule for collecting old clothes. They have great use for them after collecting them, such as distributing them to refugees. Therefore, donating old clothes is the minimum duty that everyone should fulfill.</p>
<p>Indeed, as the autumn wind rises, the sight of refugees shivering will reappear before our eyes. Considering that many noble people are adding new clothes to their wardrobe, can they bear to ignore the plight of refugees? Don't they have any human compassion?</p>
<p>In reality, we no longer need these old clothes, so donating them to the Cold Weather Clothing Collection Committee can bring some comfort to our conscience. Besides, 'doing good is the greatest joy'!</p>
<h3>White Leather Shoes</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The more expensive something is, the worse the quality, and leather shoes are no exception. A pair of leather shoes costing twenty yuan is not as good as a pair costing seven or eight yuan before the war. This May, I spent sixteen yuan on a pair of leather shoes, and after wearing them for less than a month, cracks appeared on the surface. It was truly uneconomical.</p>
<p>One or two weeks before the summer vacation, I happened to pass by a shoe store and saw several pairs of white canvas leather shoes displayed in the window, priced at only four and a half yuan. Thinking that the leather shoes I was wearing were about to fall apart, and since it was summer, I thought buying a pair of white leather shoes to replace them would be more economical.</p>
<p>So, I spent four and a half yuan without hesitation to buy a pair. Who knew that while they looked good in the shop window, once I got them in hand, the surface, lining, and soles were all of very poor quality. Before the war, we could buy a much better pair of white leather shoes for three yuan!</p>
<p>The period for wearing white leather shoes is quite long in a year, from April or May to September or October, at least half a year. If a pair of white leather shoes bought for four and a half yuan could be worn for half a year, it would still be worth it, but who knew that the ones I bought broke in less than two months. This year, I really can't think of an economical way to wear leather shoes.</p>
<p>White leather shoes get dirty easily when worn, so they need to be polished with shoe powder frequently. However, I am too lazy to groom myself, and I rarely even polish my leather shoes. So, my white leather shoes turn into black leather shoes when I wear them!</p>
<p>Similarly, pairs of white leather shoes costing twenty or thirty yuan are not uncommon, but the canvas ones are relatively cheaper. Those who like to show off should definitely not wear them. Fashionable friends wear white-grained leather or white suede shoes, which are naturally incomparable to the ones I wear.</p>
<p>One afternoon during the summer vacation, I passed by Yuchaqing Road and saw a women's shoe-shining company. The customers were quite busy, and most of the people inside getting their shoes shined were wearing white leather shoes. They were applying either white powder or a liquid polish. A proper shine, including tips, costs three to five jiao. I heard that fashionable friends have their white leather shoes shined once or twice a day, and as soon as they get stepped on and become dirty, they go to get them shined. Therefore, during the season for wearing white leather shoes, women's shoe-shining companies do particularly well. But on the other hand, people don't know how much money they spend on shining white leather shoes, which I can't help but find astounding!</p>
<h3>Hay Box Cooking</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>In Western European countries that value resources, some people practice economical cooking to save coal. They take old wooden boxes and tightly stuff them with straw or densely packed old newspapers to replace insulated cotton quilts. Or they collect wood shavings from carpenter shops to replace straw, which can be used for months or even a year without replacement. After the straw or other materials are packed into the wooden box, if the box is rectangular, they leave two deep holes large enough to hold pots or cans. If the box is square, they leave one hole. They then cover the rims of the holes with cloth or warming materials and sew them together, making sure the pots or cans fit snugly and are deeply surrounded. This item is called "Hooi-Kist" in Dutch, which is transliterated as "Hao Ji." It can be used to simulate simmering over low heat. For example, food that has been briefly exposed to high heat can be quickly placed in the box while hot and sealed tightly. After a long time, when it is opened and eaten, the energy consumed is only one-sixth of that of ordinary stove cooking. Afterwards, it will always maintain a temperature slightly below the boiling point, and its warmth will not exceed a hundred degrees. It is three times longer than stove cooking. It is like simmering over low heat, allowing it to gradually cook through. This economical method of slow cooking in a hay box saves fuel, advantage one. Because the temperature is not too high, the vitamins (nutrients) are not easily lost, advantage two. The heat is not from bottom to top but penetrates evenly from all sides, eliminating the problem of the skin burning while the inside remains uncooked, advantage three. The taste is especially good, advantage four. Furthermore, after the hay box is closed, it is never opened until it is thoroughly heated, so water vapor cannot dissipate, meaning less water should be added to the food compared to stove cooking. For example, when cooking rice normally, you should add three times the amount of water as rice, but now twice the amount is sufficient. The cooked food</p>

<h3>(57) Eggplant Stuffed with Meat</h3>
<p>— (Yao Mingjiong)</p>
<p>Ingredients: Eggplant, pork, sugar, edamame, shiitake mushrooms, dried bamboo shoots, MSG, salt, soy sauce, chopped green onions</p>
<p>Instructions: Peel the eggplant, remove the outer skin, and then use a knife to cut it in half lengthwise along the curve, stopping at the end so that it doesn't break. Then, hollow out the inside of the eggplant. Next, mince the pork, mix it with soy sauce and chopped green onions, and stuff it into the eggplant. Tie it with grass to prevent it from falling apart. Then, put it in a pot and boil it in water. When it is halfway cooked, add the edamame, shiitake mushrooms, and dried bamboo shoots. Add an appropriate amount of salt, MSG, and sugar, and continue to cook until it is thoroughly cooked.</p>
<h3>(58) Chili Peppers Stuffed with Meat</h3>
<p>— Bao Qisan</p>
<p>Ingredients: Chili peppers, fresh meat, dried mushrooms, rice wine, cooking wine, salt, cooking oil, onions or bean curd sheets</p>

<h3>One Week's Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>In last week's menu, on Wednesday, the side dish was originally supposed to be Shepherd's Purse Stir-Fried with Shredded Pork, but the character for "meat" was mistakenly printed as "ox," turning it into Shepherd's Purse Stir-Fried with Shredded Beef. "Beef thread" is a homophone for the English word "News," so the menu ended up with "Shepherd's Purse Stir-Fried with News," which is quite a joke! Speaking of shepherd's purse, it was originally the cheapest of vegetables, found everywhere in the fields, but now in the city, it is considered a rare and expensive seasonal vegetable, costing six or seven jiao per pound. If it were fried on its own, it probably wouldn't fill a large bowl. Out of necessity, we had to buy only one or two jiao's worth and stir-fry it with shredded pork, which counts as a meat dish. If we were making a vegetarian dish, shepherd's purse stir-fried with bamboo shoots could be served at a banquet, but now there are no bamboo shoots, and even if there were, they would be too expensive. It seems that the only relatively cheap thing to do is stir-fry it with broad beans, and the taste is quite delicious.</p>

<p>Whether it is vegetables, fruits, meat, or soup, it must be eaten immediately and must not be left in the hay box for too long, as the nutrients may be lost. The hay box should be ventilated and dried from time to time. At the same time, Duijn-tee, a Dutch manufacturer specializing in tea kettle barrels, has taken the inconvenience of carrying the hay box into account. Recently, they have gone a step further, carefully selecting materials that easily isolate cold or heat to produce a foldable cooking bag, Kook-Zak. This bag set comes with three pieces, which are not only useful for stewing but are also as convenient as a glass-lined thermos for preserving cold drinks, making them even more attractive. (Note: Various parts of China have been suffering from coal shortages in recent years. The production of hay boxes and cooking bags in Western Europe is something that people with foresight should carefully learn from. This good method can also cultivate the habit of saving fuel and relieve the great hidden danger of forest logging and Raub-Bau. It can benefit the family budget and people's livelihood, as well as promote forestry and prevent floods. It truly starts from the smallest things and yields the greatest benefits.)</p>
<h3>The Fastest Transportation</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>Transportation issues are closely related to modern human life. Trains, cars, ships, and airplanes, these four basic tools of "transportation," have made indelible and great contributions to humanity. However, human desires are not always satisfied, and the current maximum speed of airplanes cannot meet the needs of most people. Fortunately, scientists have foresight and are working hard to improve these four basic tools of transportation. In terms of speed, it can be said that they have reached a level of transcendence. Now, let's explain them separately:</p>
<p>(Train) Everyone knows that trains have very high speeds. However, in theory, the speed of a train itself should exceed its current speed because most of the "energy" of the steam engine is consumed by air resistance and the friction between the iron wheels and the tracks. Based on this principle, scientists have studied and reduced the energy consumption of trains to only 3%. The largest and most powerful streamlined steam locomotive can pull fourteen carriages and reach a speed of 100 miles per hour, making it the fastest train currently available. This new type of train has been running in Western Europe for some time.</p>
<p>(Car) Some people think it's rare for a car to be able to travel 400 miles per hour. Where there's a will, there's a way. This statement is not just wishful thinking. John Cobb of England recently drove a car in the United States at a speed of 368.85 miles per hour, setting a new world land speed record. This can be said to be the fastest car currently available.</p>
<p>(Ship) "The speed in water is inherently lower than on land." This statement is too outdated. Since the invention of aircraft carriers, there has been amazing progress in the problem of "transportation" in water. Now, Sir M. Campbell's "Bluebird" has set a record of 141.74 miles per hour. Isn't it faster than trains on land? This is truly the fastest ship!</p>
<p>(Airplane) Airplanes are the highest authority on "transportation," holding the championship in speed. Journeys that used to take months or years can now be reached in an instant with airplanes. The fastest airplane is the Curtiss P04 fighter, which can travel 400 to 450 miles per hour. A journey of a thousand miles can be reached in just over two hours. It's truly amazing!</p>
<h3>Bits and Pieces</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>Soy sauce that has been left for a long time is prone to mold, with a layer of white film forming on the surface. If you add a few drops of sesame oil to the soy sauce in advance, you can prevent this problem.</p>
<p>Boiling newly purchased porcelain in saltwater makes it more durable.</p>
<p>When washing dishes, placing a piece of lemon peel in the water can quickly remove odors and make the dishes shiny.</p>
<p>After using a wok, wiping it with rice ash or chaff can prevent it from rusting.</p>
<p>Collect used tea leaves, dry them in the sun, and place them in a pillow for a soft and fragrant experience.</p>
<p>It is not advisable to put flowers in the bedroom at night because flowers also absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide at night.</p>
<p>If rice is burnt, it has an unpleasant smell. You can put a piece of burning charcoal on the rice surface or put a bowl of cold water on the rice to eliminate the burnt smell.</p>
<p>Eggs can be stored in salt or saltwater for a long time without spoiling. Boiling eggs in saltwater makes them easier to peel and taste better.</p>

<h3>Three Lessons of Life (3)</h3>
<p>(3) Looking at the lives of these two people, we can see that one cultivates the soul, while the other neglects the soul. All organic animals in the world should be given the opportunity to grow, otherwise, they will surely wither. To grow, one must cultivate, just as flowers and trees need to be watered and fertilized regularly, and just as babies need to be fed milk and other baby food regularly. Otherwise, they will starve and thirst to death.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we believe that our souls are alive, we should also cultivate them, otherwise, they will also starve to death. But how should we cultivate the soul? The only way to cultivate the soul is to communicate with God. The souls of some people are half-dead and can still be saved. The souls of some people are completely dead. These people, although living in the world, are also dead because what is active is their body, and their souls have already died. Fortunately, God has the power to raise the dead, as the Jewish prophet Ezekiel said: "God can make dry bones become an army..." (Ezekiel 37:10) But it depends on whether we are willing to be revived. If we are not willing, that is suicide, and we cannot blame God.</p>
<p>One of these two people said: "I have no room to store..." (Luke 12:17) The world is filled with such material thoughts, leaving no room for God to dwell, and no room to accommodate others. Jesus spoke of a person who is focused on material life, whose plans are entirely for himself, and who does not think of God or others. The souls of these people can be said to be lost, and their lives are gradually shrinking, so small that they only know themselves and do not know others. The two people we mentioned in the previous two paragraphs and here, one is mindful of Jehovah, and the other thinks of himself everywhere. As a result, Jehovah took back the soul of one, and Jehovah saved the life of the other, allowing him to walk the path of the living. I hope that you, the readers, will keep these three lessons in mind, not to mistake illusion for reality, not to mistake loss for gain, pay less attention to material enjoyment, and work harder to cultivate the soul. The gentleman worries about the Way, not about food. How insightful are these words!</p>

<h3>Jews in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Zhu Hong</p>
<p>A chance encounter sparked my curiosity about the Jews in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Once, on Jing'an Temple Road, I was attracted by a small grocery store. The very small storefront had a few advertising displays, one of which was set up at the entrance of an apartment building. The displays were simple but exquisite, and the prices were low with generous gifts. When I looked inside, I realized it was run by Jews.</p>
<p>Another time, I passed by a store selling stamps, and the door read, "We speak Chinese inside." A friend pointed to the red-haired shopkeeper behind the counter and said, "Oh, he's a Jew."</p>
<p>Jews, Jews—the image became increasingly vivid. Whenever I talked to friends about the Jews in Shanghai, they always thought of Shylock in Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice," who demanded a pound of flesh for a loan.</p>
<p>When talking to Christians about Jews, they would remember the Jew who betrayed Jesus. When talking to merchants, they seemed as strange as the Indian moneylenders who charged exorbitant interest.</p>
<p>However, intelligence is not a crime. Similarly, no matter how eloquently you put it, distinguishing the superiority or inferiority of humans based on race is still unreasonable. Does the blood of Jews really flow with impurities? Does being clever in business become a sin?</p>
<p>Jews are quick-witted. During the speculative frenzy in Shanghai, an ordinary stockbroker became a wealthy upstart by investing in foreign exchange and became one of Shanghai's financial tycoons, Qiao Zhibu. Wasn't he a Jew?</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Jews wandered to Shanghai. Shanghai was originally a paradise for adventurers. As soon as you cross the Baibo Bridge, you can see bustling and unique ethnic groups.</p>
<p>On the side of Broadway Road, groups of two or three Jewish refugees were selling newspapers. With a leather bag hanging around their necks, the prices of their newspapers were not fixed. They allowed people to give generously out of pity and throw banknotes into the bag...</p>
<p>Many shops have also been opened there. The storefronts are even smaller than the average cigarette shops. Their products were mostly brought from Germany, but now they are gradually selling out. The goods they add are cheap but of very poor quality.</p>
<p>Most of the Jewish shops there are second-hand stores, candy stores, stamp stores, and used bookstores.</p>
<p>Once, on Xiafei Road, I saw a wandering Jew, with disheveled hair, a brown face, ragged clothes, and worn shoes with holes. His face was so depressed, and his blue eyes contained unspeakable and untold suffering. A piece of cardboard was hanging in front of his chest, with Chinese characters written crookedly on it:</p>
<p>"I am a Jewish refugee. I haven't eaten my fill for days. Please buy my goods and have pity on me!"</p>
<p>I couldn't help but feel a sense of desolation, the sorrow of a people without a country!</p>
<h3>Wolves in Sheep's Clothing</h3>
<p>— Er Xing</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I discovered two small pickpockets, aged twelve or thirteen, dressed like ordinary primary and secondary school students.</p>
<p>They were young, lively, talking, laughing, and joking. But after being caught, they couldn't withstand my scolding. Their faces turned pale, and they cried and begged. Pointing to the large man walking far away, they stammered, "…He…he…"</p>
<p>According to their confession: They were poor children who scavenged for a living. Lured by money, they were trained by the large man for more than two months under duress before engaging in this profession. The large man was supervising them!</p>
<p>I didn't hand them over to the authorities. I said to them, "Here is four jiao. Take it and go back to your parents!"</p>
<p>"Children are innocent and pure." But the temptations of society rob them of their childhood nature. Not only children, but also weak people!</p>
<p>In this "isolated island" filled with hypocrisy, deceit, and thorns, those wolves are wearing sheep's clothing and living among the sheep!</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Homecoming</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 7: "Arrest Him"</p>
<p>Hawthorne waved his hand, as if to stop him from saying more. He continued asking, "Where did you see him? In the room, or outside?"</p>
<p>Ah Gen replied, "Outside, he just came out of room 556."</p>
<p>"Alone?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it seemed like he was heading towards the staircase. He might not be in the room now. But I saw him come out empty-handed, so he definitely wasn't moving out."</p>
<p>Hawthorne stopped talking and nodded to me. I knew he was going to pay the reward, so I took out my wallet and handed Hawthorne ten ten-yuan banknotes. Hawthorne took them and stuffed them into Ah Gen's hand. The waiter naturally put on a show of refusing. Hawthorne stopped him and said, "Don't be polite. Now, go find your friend Little Li outside and ask him if this man named Sun has returned. Also, tell him that if we need to open the door, tell him to give us every convenience."</p>
<p>Ah Gen nodded repeatedly and turned to leave.</p>
<p>Hawthorne stopped him and said, "Wait, if you see me later, don't greet me. Give me a secret signal whether he's there or not."</p>
<p>Number 71 nodded, didn't say a word, and walked towards the staircase. Hawthorne leaned in and whispered to me.</p>
<p>"You go down with him first, be careful, don't get too close. I'll make a phone call and come."</p>
<p>After Hawthorne finished speaking, he turned and went towards the west end of the corridor. I followed in the direction Ah Gen had gone, down the cement stairs. Ah Gen was walking very fast. When I reached the sixth floor, I still hadn't caught up with him; by the time I got to the fifth floor, I still didn't see any sign of Ah Gen. I decided to slow down and slowly enter the corridor, looking for room 556. The location of this room was quite winding. I turned two corners before I found it. The door was closed, and there was no one outside. Of course, I couldn't just knock, but I put my ear to the door and listened, but there seemed to be no sound inside. I looked to the left and right, there was no one coming or going in the corridor. So I squatted down and put my eye to the keyhole on the door, peering into the room. (115)</p>
<h3>Corridor</h3>
<p>— Yan Zheng</p>
<p>The third floor of that skyscraper standing on the corner of the bustling S Road and N Road, after the war, became a "refuge" for some of the highest institutions of learning.</p>
<p>On the same second floor, separated from those highest institutions of learning only by a corridor, was a privately established circulating library. I paid a one-yuan deposit there and could borrow any books I liked to read at any time. Perhaps that library was too suitable for the needs of the public, and the number of people borrowing and reading was like the swarms of fish crossing a river. In front of each small borrowing window, it was always densely crowded with heads; even in the current season, squeezing and squeezing, sweat would immediately seep out of the body.</p>
<p>At this time, I always temporarily shrunk back, silently waiting against the wall. Or enviously glanced at the running back and forth on the other side of the corridor, those male and female college students. They laughed and talked loudly…</p>
<p>I couldn't help but look at the swaying heads in front of me, secretly amazed: "What</p>
<p>a contrast!"</p>
<p>On one side, there are sufficient resources, time, and learned instructors, who can conduct specialized and systematic research.</p>
<p>On this side, most of them are out-of-school shop assistants and apprentices: without education, without a compass, with limited leisure time and hard work, groping like blind people, wanting to find a correct and bright path.</p>
<p>The road may have shortcuts and difficulties, but every road leads to Rome!</p>
<p>"Let's take this corridor as our race track!" I murmured softly to those college students.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Soaring, Haggling at the Hairpin Shop</h3>
<p>— He Ji Zuo</p>
<h3>Beggars · Begging for Food</h3>
<p>Now, "beggars" should definitely be called "begging for food," because when they beg door to door, if someone gives them one or two cents, they will say directly, "Madam! The money is too little, do you have any leftover rice or soup to give? I'm hungry, madam! What good is one or two cents? Even a big pancake costs three cents!"</p>
