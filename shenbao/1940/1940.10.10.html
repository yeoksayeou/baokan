<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國民族運動與國際現象</h3>
<p>中華民國二十九年雙十節，所際遇的國際局勢乃若此，必然的，誰都體會到其間深長意義。辛亥革命是中國民族運動的發凡，現在是民族運動煆練完成的最後階段，而所處的國際局勢恰是最大的煆練洪鑪。</p>
<p>國際局勢因德義與日本互相勾引，使環繞中日兩國的遠東氛圍，再小能繼續其混沌；使國際全局的陰霾為之廓淸，分野為之明期；使事實證明了中國抗戰的得道多助。由今日回憶當年，遠東糾紛剛剛開始的時候，不過是星星之火，雖其背景未嘗不挾有若干比較嚴重的問題，但其時縱火的何嘗料到竟會發展到如此規模，甚至間接釀成了世界的大戰慘禍。到了現在，中國抗戰的具有世界意義，既因遠東最近演變而大明；國際已往種種固蔽或偏見，以及種種有形無形損害着中國的措施，於今亦得及時而澈底矯正；根本的，中國民族運動之本質與其對於遠東大局安危的關聯，亦應由各方深刻認識，而與中國密切提携，庶幾對於當前日益擴大的太平洋危機作充分有效的措置。</p>
<p>從辛亥年到現在，這將近三十年的悠久歲月，實是中華民國的締造過程；而最近三年中所淮行看的戰爭，也就是建國過程中最艱辛最後的一幕。在戰爭中的一切經過，已足證明新的中國已經開始踏入現代强國之列；這是近幾年中軍民上下犧牲奮鬥的成果，同時也是自辛亥以迄於今長期民族運動所顯示的功效。成效卓著，這在中國人自已固不能冉妄自菲薄；而國際對中國的觀感也應該放到新的水準之上，重加考量；吾則必然對於遠東以至整個世界發生小良影響。耍知遠東局勢之動盪小髯，於今也是幾十年了、其主要原因自然在於有關各國間之不能形成穩定的平衡，而癥結還是在缺乏一個强盛中国的存在，中国民族運動的終極目標，即在彌補這一重大缺陷；而另一方面，這也就是侵略中國者所以要極力加以摧殘。近幾年來，中國臨為山九仞的節段；未來遠東安寗和秩序的恢復，只有在中國以獨立自由的姿態屹立於亞洲大陸之後纔有可能。不但如此，太平洋危機愈嚴重，這一需求便愈迫切。民主列强最近对遠東的特殊關切和種種應急措施的考慮，都證明了即將在太令洋上展開一個新的時代；而其中一個最重大的任務便是如何史進一步，使這些措施與遠東已存在着的有效因素相配合。中國的民族獨立運動亦亟應從這一擴大了的國際危機當中爭取最後任務的完成。試看近年的國際，若干强弱大小的國家都變成附庸甚或消滅，若干地區在地圖上也改變了顏色；只有中國，不問國際環境之為利為害，友邦列强之是否支　，始終艱苦支撑，不屈不撓，以自力保衛國家，向着預定的目標邁進；這除却發揮了中國民族運動的眞實價值而外、也充分盡到了在遠東維護正義和秩序的重任，這是應為今日舉世所共認的事實。</p>
<p>最近侵略者種種行徑之鹵莽滅裂、有類在易、殆已非常情常理所能想像和控制；但這絕不是世界危局愈益趨於黑暗與混亂的朕兆；反之，到正是撥亂反正所必須經過的過程。察之最近種種情勢的演變。光明的因素正租黑暗成正比例增加着：而且無論如何，正義公道都是每一個人天性中所具備着的美德，而侵略刦只是為了遂行少數人的貪慾；在長期的折磨洗鍊當中，一切意氣以至因習的弱點，都會逐　消除，終於留存的，當然只有先天的美德。中國三年來的苦戰已　　此說之不謬，則在世界的戰爭形態中，當然亦必如此趨歸。入夜愈深，破曙愈近，無論中國民族　動　或遠東以及世界的前途，現在都已在沉沉暗夜中透露了一　曉光。</p>
<h3>泰機迭次飛越　泰越關係益惡化　法稱對泰國要求置之不理　泰國大學生舉行示威運動</h3>
<p>河內　此間之法國官員昨晚宣稱、渠等巳接獲維希政府之訓令、對泰國向法所提之恐嚇要求、「置之不理」、同時、此間官方又復否認在泰越　境、雙方父發生衝突、又吾認泰國軍隊巳越過越南前錢之說、法國官員父稱、泰法間之談判目前完全由維希與盤谷負責舉行、同時、法國在越軍官五人之退休、巳使此間略感不安、（九日台衆社電）</p>
<p>盤谷　泰國大學生三千人、昨日麕集國防部門首、要求修改對越南　界、當泰國總理宋格倫將軍向學生發表演說之時、示威學生咸熱烈歡呼、宋氏申明泰國所要求者僅為泰國領土及泰人所居之區域、學生旋於下午又復舉行示威游行、此為泰國歷史上所創見云、（九日海通社電）</p>
<p>盤谷　泰國總理鑒於越南與泰國之關係甚為緊張、又採取預防之措施、內政部開始偵杳法國人在泰國之活動、並廣播報吿、泰國人民今後弗冉收受越南錢幣、以免日後遭遇損失、政府復頒佈文吿、　　空軍志願兵五百名、十七　　以　、二十足歲以下者為合格、此間報章以顯著之地位、　戰法國政府拒絕泰國要求割讓領土之報吿、目有倡議迅速採取行動者、（九日海通社電）</p>
<p>河內　法權威消息項稱、泰國對於法泰組縱聯合委員會以解決兩國間之小事件、而將泰國領土要求聽候維希辦理一節、原則上巳予贊同、（九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>維希　近日泰國飛機、迭次飛人法屬越南領空、因此　方關係、頗是緊張、日昨父有一越南老撾人、名奈香泰（譯音）者、在湄公河上、被越南憲兵所擊斃、泰國政府、堅　死者係該國臣民、於是局勢益　惡化、據此間所獲可靠消　、此人實企圖自湄公河泅水而過、致為法力憲兵所射擊、且事後調查、死者實係越南所屬之老撾土著、泰國政府欲引起國際注意、竟籍口此人為該國臣民、而將經過情形、通吿該國駐外使館，但此間一般人咸認為此案實出泰國政府主動、其用意正與前此該國飛機之侵入越南領空、如出一轍也，（八日哈瓦期社電）</p>
<p>維希　關於法屬越南與泰國間近頃所發生之界務糾紛、此間消息靈通人士頃談稱、法國於本年六月初、會與泰國簽訂互不侵犯條的、惟此項條的未能立卽批准、同時法國駐泰國公使萊比西埃與泰國總理畢勃爾亦曾就解決各項　界問題、交換文件、查泰國與越南之邊界綫、遠在一九〇七年時、卽未劃分淸楚、尤以湄公河流域為然、該河左岸、泰國得享有若干權利、而其右岸、則完全由法國控制之、是以湄公河中無數小島之主權問題、遂時起爭議、迨至本年六月十二日、法國駐泰國公使與泰國總理交換文件、目標卽在解決此項困難、當時泰國政府會鄭重聲明、湄公河邊界問題解決　、泰國政府卽不再提出任何領土要求、詎意該國乘日本與　南進行談判之際、突然通知法國政府、謂法泰兩國互不侵犯條的、非至雙方成立混合委員會進行泰越劃界工作之後、不能予以掛准、迨至九月　、泰國竟又進　步而提出其他領土要求、大意謂越南主權　倘　移轉他國、則法國　以老撾及柬浦寨兩邦割讓泰國、　外　幷要求越南　　湄公河　　屬於法國主權之若十地方、部份在泰　附近、另一部分則　老撾　部、法國政府對於上述各項要求、業已予以拒絕、（八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<h3>德大軍沿多瑙河　源源不絕開入羅境　有進窺伊拉克油田企圖　波蘭境內德軍增至百師</h3>
<p>羅京　第一批德軍現沿多瑙河而下、携有坦克車平射砲高射砲飛機隊、德軍開抵桀爾桀後、將進至泊拉哈與布卡區、及羅京附近之太哥維斯特、德軍將在該處建一空軍根據地、油區及桀爾桀油管終點均將架高射砲、近數星期中德國戰品源源運入羅境、其數之多為前所未有、値價甚巨、故羅國與德國之貿易向為德欠羅方、今巳成羅欠德方矣、（九日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　路透社外方訪員聲稱、開入羅境之德軍人數幾何、用意何在、將駐何地、因宣傳及羅國檢查電訊之故、均無從探悉、德國秘密警察部所派人員已在羅國活動若干時、佈置一切德軍如何開入羅境、此為一令人注意之問題、匈國或巳步瑞典芬蘭兩國之後塵而容德國假道、羅國招律德軍之行動允屬遠背中立、按上年德國用兵波蘭時、會集大軍於由波蘭通入羅國之鐵路一帶後、因蘇聯軍疾進先佔波蘭、蘇聯旣佔領該地、巳重敷闊軌、與蘇聯之鐵路同一尺度、（九日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英國人士昨晚接得消息、謂德國最近會巨量增援在波蘭之德軍、衆信此舉殆係企圖向蘇聯施用壓力之故、攘另一英人認為可靠之消息、德軍在波蘭境內者現已達一百師之兵力、據各方揣測、德國增加在波兵力、乃使將來德國一旦在黑海及撻靼尼爾有所行動時、蘇聯不得不採取「友好」之反應、（九日合衆電）</p>
<p>瑞典京城　「泰登根報　頃發表一未證實之柏林消息、謂德義軍隊卽將衝過羅馬尼亞及土耳共而至伊拉克，以圖攫取英國油田、（九日合衆社）</p>
<p>德國對羅軍事行動由兩項因素所構成</p>
<p>倫敦　據路透社軍事訪員羅威上校聲稱、今日羅馬尼亞之軍事局勢、實為若干因素所構成、地理上之地位農　田及天然資源、允其為油類之豐富、巳使羅國成為東西兩方之軍事目標、故來自西方之侵略實不足為異、德人至少將調用其兩個著名混合軍團以佔領羅國、羅馬尼亞陸軍雖配備稍舊、但其軍官及士兵之數額共計一百六十萬人、軸心國於勃倫納山隘會議後、特派精銳德軍為先頭部隊、無疑卽係因此、德國混合軍團之編組如下、（一）摩托車機關槍隊及輕裝甲車步兵隊所紙成之偵察隊伍、（二）坦克車五四〇輛所組成之放團、在法國北部頗為成功、（三）乘摩托自行車之來復槍兵一旅團、的五個大隊及摩托自行車、與裝有步兵砲高射砲及平射砲之車輛、（四）砲兵一聯隊及五吋口徑榴彈砲一百尊、希特勒即以此項軍隊之力量、致法國於崩潰、自極願使之在英海岸一顯身手、但結果竟未能如願解散之固屬可惜、於是乃有繼續維持及訓練之問題發生、故今之開人羅馬尼亞實係一舉兩得、此外尙有另一因素、卽德國飛機數量或超過英國、但德空軍之大部分力量、係在俯衝轟炸機輔助陸地之混合軍團固佳、惟在英與噴火旋風諸式飛機相遇時、即紛紛下墜、如深秋之落葉、際此軸心國家最後決戰尙屬遙遠之時、此項俯衝轟炸機及機械化師團、自不能任其如目下之閒散、就軸心國全部軍事行動而觀、可見彼等已於發覺對英實力作嚴重之誤算後、業將以前之軍事計書加以改變、德總司令部在此時變更共預定計畫、實巳自承失敗、蓋今日與六月間之局勢已大不相同、英國之陸軍巳日臻强盛、其空軍亦在此期間頗有擴充、强有力之轟炸機及長距離戰鬥機不久即將出動、襲擊任何地方之德義陣地也、（九日路透電）</p>

<h3>邱吉爾在下院　陳述戰事局勢　英海陸空防務大見增强　敵速戰決計畫成幻夢</h3>
<p>倫敦　英相邱吉爾今日在下議院陳述戰局情勢、謂希特勒對我平民與都邑洩其忿毒、今巳逾月、彼自稱將夷英國城邑為平地、吾人所應發問之第一點當然為德國轟炸機之全部實力、究已展開至何種程度乎、德國短距離俯衝轟炸機約數百架、自八月十五日遭遇大打擊後、不復發現、殆將留充後備、以用於侵英之總計書中、或移用於他處戰地、皆不可知、故吾人所應付者僅為長距離重轟炸機、平均計之、每一畫夜似有軍轟炸機四百架飛臨吾人海岸、此數能否大增、是為疑問、所可無疑者、有時德機可傾其全力連續數日之久、然以月計之、其平均數未必大增也、過去十日敵機來襲者數巳漸减、大空襲開始以還之一個月內、英國生命傷亡物質損毀已逐漸低减、德轟炸機之駕駛員泰半僅能濫投炸彈、以整個言、德方襲英之努力巳吸收其所有力量之一部份、余不願謂吾人巳量準敵方力量、惟吾人對於敵力、確較前更有把握、德方自稱開戰以來共向英國擲落炸藥二萬二千噸、並稱前星期四夜、饗倫敦以二百五十一噸炸藥、查是夜倫敦共死一百八十人、依此計算、炸彈一噸尙不能炸死一人、以視一九一四至一九一八年攻擊之凶險、僅及十三分之一耳、吾人在交戰之初、自料每夜將死二三千、傷一萬二千、惟自開戰起至上星期六日止、因轟炸而死者共的八千五百人、傷者一萬三千人、自九月七日大空襲開始以後、死傷數字每週縮减、初為六千、後减至三千、房屋損毀則殊不少、照目前損毀率、欲　毀倫敦房屋之半數、須經十年之久、惟未及十年、希特勒與其納粹政體將巳發生許多事、而墨索里尼將巳飽嘗其在背後刺擊法國時所不及料之經騐矣、</p>
<h3>應付空襲　採新計畫</h3>
<p>何者為報復與何者為非報復之問題、可無庸爭辯、吾人不可希望冬季可减少轟炸、吾人或將有新方法、使敵人感覺夜間或霧中加諸平民之大轟炸、較諸目前更為艱險工作者、余此時未便說明此種新方法、宜使敵人從實際經騐中自覺之、吾人必須於最短時期中、在常遭空襲之處、使人人有可置臥具之避彈室、今巳着手使臥於避彈室者在冬夜中獲有食物與熱水供給之大計畫、而救濟滬舍被毀者之機關刻亦在擴大中、財相巳妥擬全國强制保險以防不動產被毀之議案、政府並擬就各種動產連傢具在內之保險辦法、如是吾人可說明希特勒恐怖英人之行為、悉歸失敗、猶其確性水電等之不足破壞我海上交通、</p>
<h3>危機未云戒備不懈</h3>
<p>至於德方侵英一點、今不可謂危機巳過、吾人仍當積極加强海陸空之防務、德方之所以迄未實行侵英者、其主要理由為英空軍巳迭　勝利、八月十五日九月十五日與九月十七日之三大勝利、巳昭示世界吾人規已獲有天空優勢矣、空軍旣勝、海軍威勢乃愈穩定、不獨美方驅逐艦今漸入隊、而他處後援亦陸績前來、英國在數月空戰後、此時空軍在戰鬥機與轟炸機兩方面皆較本年五月問為强、而飛行員方面亦復迅速改善、英國能於戰爭第一年中追及德國之空軍、此固世人前所夢相不到者、吾人進步絕塵而馳、明年此時、關於此事之言論定可愈使人滿意云、</p>
<h3>增援中東氣象轉佳</h3>
<p>英相言及中東等處英軍增援事、謂敵軍遠越沙漠前來攻犯、他日英澳紐約絲綸印度與埃及軍隊合圍攻之時、勝負如何固不可預定、惟余所可言者、吾人刻正盡力為之、今之氣象巳較若干時前為佳矣、</p>
<h3>西非一役失敗原因</h3>
<p>央相繼言及達加爾一役謂、此役純屬法人事、英方雖準備予以在某種環境下、可決定達加爾局勢之援助、然亦不願使特戈爾將軍與維希方面之法人發生長期之劇烈摩擦、英政府當始終援助特戈爾、至達其目的而後止、絕無中途捨棄之意、達加爾全部局勢、因有法巡艦與驅逐艦各三艘駛到、致生不利變化、此六艦皆載有擁護維希之人物、彼等奉命赴達加爾、以鎮懾居民而指導防務、英政府對於維希法艦素抱如不駛往敵方控制口岸、則不干涉其行動之政策、此次法艦駛近直布羅陀峽、海軍大臣與戰爭內閣初無所聞、迨接報時巳不及阻之、此乃若干錯誤所致、今巳成軍事處分問題、政府會發令在加薩白蘭加阻止法艦、如屬不能則阻其駛入達加爾、此兩種措施皆未成功、但此法艦迄未能進行其攻擊杜亞拉口岸之謀、法艦兩艘卒入達加爾港、倚有兩艘為英巡艦所追及、折回加薩白蘭加、未用武力、達加爾一役維希方而喪失潛艇兩艘、一驅逐艦着火、一巡艦被砲擊中、而法方「里契留」號主力艦亦續受損毀、至於英方則戰艦與大巡艦各一艘受損、然仍當作戰祗須稍事修理耳、</p>

<h3>上海美僑從事準備　將先遣婦孺回國　有利中國抗戰人心興奮　美郵船艙位均預定一空</h3>
<p>自德義日三國軍事經濟同盟後、英國決放棄以前綏靖政策、對於滇緬公路本月八日決意開放、美國亦以該三國之同盟針對自己、知太平洋與大西洋之風雲日益加緊、積極聯絡與國、尤其與英國取得密切聯絡、一面以大量貸款援華、支持中國抗戰、而對日擴大禁運、使資料日益缺乏、益以海軍部長諾克斯上將宣稱接受日本之挑釁、可知英美在遠東方面決不任侵略者之趾高氣揚、而自揖其旣得之樣益、證之最近前　駐華艦隊司令諾貝爾上將突然蒞滬會晤美遠東艦隊司令赫德上將、而美國國務卿勸吿撤退僑居遠東之僑民、以作將來進一步之戒備、此種局勢、顯見英美聯合對抗侵略、以答復德義日之三國同盟、而維護兩大洋之和平陣綫　已漸臻明朗化、平明社記者以美國旣有勸撤遠東僑民一舉、與本埠現狀、不無有重大影響、爰向各方探詢所知、彙誌如後、</p>
<p>接奉訓訟解釋意義</p>
<p>關於華盛頓美當局、決定撤退其遠東僑民一事、本埠代理美總領事、業於昨晚接到國務院訓令據平明社記者於昨午向美領署之負責人員方面探詢、據稱、撤退上海美僑、美領署並非以命令方式行之、而以通吿方式、向不必要留於遠東之僑民、勸其回國而已、所謂不必要留居遠東之美僑、乃指在遠東並無事業及並無任務者爲限、如游歷在遠東指定撤退地區之美僑男子、以及一般婦孺等、凡在遠東有事業或任務者、目前並不在勸吿撤退歸國之內、是以本埠美國各商業機關、以及美商之銀行報館等、仍照常營業、</p>
<p>麥令斯隊亦作考慮</p>
<p>遠東局勢、由於美國定撤退　遠東之非必要僑民而益趨緊張、昨日上午、本埠若干外人之權威方面、更傳出一重要消息稱、本埠美國駐滬防軍麥令斯隊亦將由滬撤退、平明社記者於獲得是項消息後、當於昨午向駐滬美海軍之關係方面探詢、據悉、現駐於本埠之美國防軍、爲美海軍陸戰隊第四團、人數的千名、現已決定作撤退之準備、惟撤退日期、現尙未定、至於撤退步驟、現正由海軍當局在考慮中、</p>
<p>甲蒙運艦下月抵滬</p>

<p>接受挑戰應有戒備</p>
<p>某觀察家首闡述美國撤僑意義稱、院宣稱、此舉純係一種戒備性質、並非由於任何特殊局勢造成、故吾人對此、不必過分重視、良以美國膽大心細、萬一遠東局勢有變、對保護僑民之安全、不致有所忽促、美國所以出此、實由日本方面之挑戰行爲實有以致之、換言之、卽美國有接受日本挑戰之準備而已、至在滬美僑撤退、官方尙未接到正式命令、目前僅有一部分美人自動離滬、允以婦孺爲多、各美人團體商號、亦僅作觀望態度、至實行全部撤退、當非最短期內所能實現、一俟政府正式命令到達、、在滬美領館及有關當局、當開始登記調查手續、目前在滬美僑、的近萬人、該觀察家論美國撤退遠東麥令斯隊事、據謂美國遠東駐軍、除菲律濱外、僅有華北·上海·兩地、且爲數亦不多、此項兵力、若果撤退、亦不過移駐美國遠東根據地、並非减少遠東兵力、實係集中兵力、屆時美國艦隊將流動駐紮、至擴充與吾、將視局勢而定、凡上述種種、吾人尤覺言之過早、至美國是項措施、爲極有程序之行動，決非一般所能預料者也、</p>
<p>美僑機關態度鎭靜</p>
<p>昨日本市對美僑撒退消息、影響頗為劇烈、美人方面、如機關團體、態度均極鎮靜、惟私人方面、略較緊張、而小規模之商號、有作整理準備者、美商銀行提存、亦較往日爲多、凡無正當事業者、已作買棹返國之準備、惟美商各大公司·銀行·商號、營業一如恒狀、且較往日允爲忙碌、據記者向美國郵船公司獲悉、開往美國郵船、本月份爲比亞士總統號、十月二十八日啟椗、該輪上下艙位、已預售一空、下月份爲柯立芝總統號、十一月七日啟椗、該輪僅統艙尙有餘位、兩輪之乘客、以自動離滬之婦孺爲多、至將來作有序之撤退時、當由政府當局派輪遣送、</p>
<p>日報對此隻字不提</p>
<p>此間日本及各國外僑、對美國撒退僑民一舉、極爲重視、日僑略具恐慌、而日方報紙對此項消息、亦隻字不提、並聞若十日商　準備放棄對美交易、至其他外僑力面、雖覺美國此舉、大有維護遠東權益之決心、但無動靜、除抱冷靜態度俟將來之發展外、並無不安動靜、至外報對此項消息、僅以次要地位刋載、惟一般情儲、殊趨興奮、</p>
<p>租界現狀不致改觀</p>
<p>華人方面認為該英消息、對中國抗戰極爲有利、故甚興奮、記者昨以美僑撒退與上海地位是吾有影響、叩詢熟悉市政之某要人、據稱、此後局勢如何轉變、吾人雖未能預料、惟上海情形特殊、爲一國際間共管之都市、卽一國放棄管轄權、則由其他各國出而共同管轄、且租界當局之美籍主持人、仍將留滬、故決不　改觀而兩租界外人財產極鉅、決不容任何人侵犯、無論警權政權、均一仍舊貫、此觀乎目前英駐軍撤退後情形、卽可預知、惟華人方面目前遊資充足、將來對外貿易較有影響、、一般資產階級、當可乘此機會將過剩資金、移往中國內地、以發展有利之工商實業、</p>
<p>金融市塲昨起波動</p>

<p>郵船艙位預定一空</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、昨日（八日）美國務卿訓令本市領事館勸吿美僑民離滬後、此間英國僑民、極爲震動、據美國僑民方面意見、全部撤退、實屬不可能、因船隻不敷也、美國各總統號郵船、至十二月之艙位、皆已預定一空、十二月底來遠東之柯立芝號總統號郵船、尙有少數艙位可定、其他太平洋郵船、除總統綫　、祇有加拿大郵船公司與日本郵船株式會社兩航錢、惟據美國總統郵船公司職員稱、如　態緊急時、美政府必命令美國海運委員會派船至遠東、撤退美僑　或許　于總統綫郵船、將擔任斯職、美總統郵船公司前往問詢之美國僑民、日來幾有二百人、下三班郵船、皆已無艙位可定、祗十二日之柯立芝總統號、尙有若干艙位、又稱、如美國海運委員會接奉政府命令、實行緊急法令、則總統號郵船、須增加臨時床、以便美國僑民撤退、美僑返國、皆須自費、無力購票者、由美政府貸款、惟須　遠、美領事館現又與各敎會圑體領　接洽、勸令先將妻孺撤退、本月廿三日來滬之柯立芝總統號、或有若干敎士被迫返美、又聞本市美領事館於日內發出通吿，勸　僑撤退婦孺、</p>

<h3>中外各銀行一致　停做外匯套利　自中美新借款成功後　黑市外滙已無利可套</h3>
<p>自平準外滙基金委員會竭力維持外滙後、必需品之輸入得申請法定外滙、主要土貨之輸出結售外滙政府、所以中央銀行之法定外匯價始終穩定、對上海黑市之外匯、授權英美商銀行酌予維持、今中外各銀行為防止投機操縱滙市起見、除限制遠期交易及掉期外、已正式通過停做外滙套利、凡華商及洋商銀行公會會員銀行、決一致遵守議決案、</p>
<p>公會正式通過</p>
<p>上海黑市外匯、暗中由平準外匯基金委員會授權匯豐等銀行設法維持、自中美二千五百萬美元借款成功後、黑市外滙放長、法幣價値無形提高、英美各銀行爲防止投機者操縱滙市、會商定拒絕遠期外匯交易、及限制外匯到期、使投機者無法施其技、惟事實上因外匯市塲分子複雜、經營者並未澈底辦理、所以投機之風仍未完全絕跡、今上海銀行業同業公會暨外商銀行公會已正式通過停止外匯套利、凡該兩公會之會員銀行均應遵辦　聞其宗旨爲防止投機者之操縱匯市、及謀上海黑市外滙得以持久穩定、</p>
<p>套利無形絕跡</p>
<p>外滙市塲近期之價値旣賤、足以吸收賣者、遠期之價值旣貴、足以吸收賣者、於是擁有餘資者出而套利、買近賣遠、則近期市價卽應逐漸提高、遠期行市卽應逐漸壓低、俟兩者差數至接近之時、則無利可套、所以套利並非持久性、必須遇到機會時爲之、同時限於有實力者方能做之、故每遇市塲銀根奇緊之際、則套利之機會愈多、套利最好時能得利息七八分之多、惟目前之上海黑市外滙、暫無利可套、如各銀行能一致拒絕遠期外匯交易、則外滙套利能無形杜絕、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、復又在跌、此乃受報載種種不安時局發展之影響、如英國正式通吿日本於十八日重開緬甸公路、兼美國國務院警吿美國人民撤退遠東、遂致發生猛烈賣風、收盤前最低曾創五千四百七十五元、結果收盤亦僅五千五百〇五元、較隔昨在跌二百十元、收後塲外雖曾回升、但午後暗盤已做小至五千四百五六十元、至前途在美日關係未澄淸以前、恐難望高、半天交易约三千兩、銀樓飾金掛小三十元、海關金等仍平、今日爲國慶紀念、循例停市、</p>
<p>烚赤一瀉二百十</p>
<p>晨初市塲一片散漫之象、蓋報載消息利空、及匯市吿鬆、開市卽猛撳一百三十五元、銀號出金號等數十兩、爲五千五百八十元、繼錢兌業忽來在吸補空、立升至五千六百十元、嗣因現金號及證劵帮力賣、復跌至五千五百八十元、後以某證劵帮突反出力扒、同時銀號帮亦跟之搜入、一度遂回漲達五千六百二十五元，奈匯市愈硬、高價難以久站、現金號及錢兌業等猛塞下、驟吿在跌七八十元、退爲五千五百四五十元、後再加銀號帮亦傾向吐賣、且一時買戶更少、立慘入五千五百元大關、創見五千四百七十五元低價、收盤　賣者减少、回升至五千五百〇五元收盤、結果比上日軋跌二百十元、收後塲外會又回高至五千五百三十元、但午後復走軟疲、重退入五千五百元大關、半天一百五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低十三元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金竟連小三檔</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、九時四十分掛小十元、十一時三十分續跌十元、午後三時許再小十元、結果大同行改懸五百六十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣直瀉　美金票到十六元</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、因自美國務院訓令在遠東僑民撤退之消息、見諸報端後、人心惶惶、種種流言卽因此而起、烚赤在落二百餘元、英美金鎊因亦暴落五元半、英金票猛降二元半、美金票於午後曾退至十六元、卒爲十六元二角、比上日猛降一元一角、香港票仍隨港滬匯兌步跌一角半、此外如新加坡及羅比·坎拿大·菲列濱票等亦莫不下趨、日金票供售者亦湧、晚市退爲一元四角一分、朝鮮票趨勢亦軟、晚市退爲一元一角三分、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米一漲即逝</h3>
<p>洋米早市被報載國際間緊張新聞所影響、市塲中謠言蜂起、投機貨囤借此宜傳越米路運危險與今後來源或虞中斷、乃引浮戶與盲從之競相收補、因洋米雖由愼記洋行續有拋售西貢二號一千噸、價祇七十六元二角、且另有七十五元之電報打去、而洋米市價反被抬高一元以上、旋滙水冉長、洋行兜售不絕、曾有七十五六元已經續妥之說、兼因近來定貨二三十萬包、已有半數在途小日可到、獲利與大與頗有趁高售出、因此午市立卽回小近元、下午賣氣甚濃、繼續下跌、結果反比前日較小半元之譜、全日回籠原包未開、現貨成交八千多包、並以今日國慶紀念休業、實銷亦頗多採辦、</p>
<p>破粳祇到早晚稻百餘石、惟銷塲方面備受新粳牽制、致售價平平、與前相仿、開南港特早八十七元、普通八十五元、次至七十七元、</p>
<p>新粳尖及窰種水陸兩運共到二三千包、到貨雖旺、而去路較暢、故呈到銷兩平、市無變化、開閔行新粳七十九元、次至七十六元、西塘容種七十七元、太倉羊尖六十四元至六十二三元、靑角杜尖七十元次至六十六元、</p>
<p>糯米國貨及洋元、因惟零星銷路、故仍平淡無奇、未見軒輊、開價金溧特元猶爲七十二元、常丹七十一元至七十元、洋貨同、</p>
<h3>麪粉欲囤無貨</h3>
<p>麪粉昨續堅挺、本客交易並不鬧熱、實由於華廠供應有限、日粉又禁運租界、其他內地粉與洋粉、亦僅能點綴市塲、惟人心以米價回漲、及美僑撤退消息、大衆認爲利多、一般投機者均思拉吸、苦於籌碼缺乏、無從發展、爲鳳凰期貨交易停頓故也、聞本街略辦下脚粉紅桃花價十五元二三角、及洋粉雙鷹及砲台脾十八元五六角、老車棧單經前日一度暗鬆、昨又昂至十八元半、與廠粉客盤相埒、</p>
<p>小麥昨日交易仍靜、日廠進胃平淡、祇應酬送廠貨每日數百包、價仍爲二十一元二三角、華廠收進亦難寬放、運入租界貨亦少、聞附近太倉新麥案價二十七元、還價二十六元尙未做開、又聞本街辦去浦東運來大麥十包價爲二十三元、做藥材需用、</p>
<h3>證券　內債回小數角</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨市初開甚强、人後賣氣甚湧而轉跌、昨日丙種除中籤計算、開盤鴻天信昌買進曾抬至八元四五角、入後聯益及散戶賣出爲多、復又打破八元小至七元三角、繼以潤利永康同康紛紛買進而回堅、下午辦理卽日交割停市、因今日爲國慶紀念、休假一天、市價結果一致回小三角半至六角不等、成交總數共計约八十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交天廚味精廠一百股　價爲八十七元、</p>
<p>倫敦外債行市等不變動、上海外股行市頗有變動、參閱市價欄、</p>
<h3>油市　生油進出頗旺</h3>
<p>昨由靑島運來生油七千二百十件、豆子三百包、亦有豆子五百包、運往新加坡、今日有豆子七百包運厦門、生油一千三百八十聽運廈門、五百件運香港、</p>
<h3>絲茶　紐約絲市投機</h3>
<p>昨美日絲價上升甚巨、允以紐约爲烈、蓋太平洋風雲日緊、美國當局巳表示或將禁絲進口、故紐约交易所投機蜂起、標凖絲近遠期貨絲價高漲一角許、現貨日絲漲四分至六分，上海絲漲四分、廣東絲漲二分、</p>
<p>横濱現貨漲二十元、遠期漲元、本埠絲價亦向上回漲、白廠七八分絲價售五一〇〇元、惜手貨不多耳、</p>
<h3>日絲產量磊减</h3>
<p>今年日本產絲量遠遜往昔、據日本農林省發表今年本可收繭五一、〇一〇、〇〇〇貫、但事實上僅收三九、九六二、三二〇貫、計少收百分之二十、而爲五年來日本繭收最惡劣之一年、蓋中日戰事開始以琮、影響日本農村勞働力甚巨、且今年會遭天氣不良影響、致使產繭銳减云、（按去年日本產繭量四四、七叫六、五九三貫、一九三八年產繭量四〇、八六三、二八四貫、一九三七年產繭量四五、五〇三、二八四貫、一九三六年產繭量四一、三九二、四七四貫、一九三五年產繭量四四、一七五、五二六貫、本年產繭量爲最少之一年）、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布運港</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市　外滙繼續鬆長、囤戶心思忐忑、各貨隨市又來吐售、惟實需各貨、以買戶陸續吸收不懈、形勢仍殊堅穩、售盤迴旋、頗少軒輊、細紗綫織品、如嗶嘰綫呢等以原料昂貴、售盤漲每疋一角半至三角、本街成交各貨五百餘件、粵港帮辦色布色斜粗布等二百餘件、浙皖帮辦粗布色布等一百數十件、北路烟津帮辦絨布藍布粗布等一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　因紗價回落、交易淡薄、升降範圍亦小、十二磅龍頭細布收盤爲三十六元三角半、四君子嗶嘰每碼一元〇八分半、中檔細布價仍穩定、無甚榮辱、</p>
<p>出口　昨日有疋頭四十件運新加坡、七百二十件運香港、今日又有一千五百五十件運香港、一百十五件運廈門、</p>
<h3>抱別林銷路暢</h3>
<p>抱別林在目今雨衣料中、頗占有相當地位、西裝雨衣風行、因其質輕舒便、顏色灰黃較藏靑為俏活、元色絕無僅有、來路貨每碼批沽二址二元、現在普通人士、大半均乏力購製、以致國產抱別林應運而起、香港粵幫需要頗　、按十之八九、皆將雨衣在申製成後而裝去、昨祥生信昌等戶、開進仁泰人猿泰山拖別林雨在二千餘碼、成交價爲三元二角半凈盤、查國產抱別林幅寬祇有三十英寸、裁製一件需料須五碼半、做工大约每件四元算、上海店舖每件普通均售二十二三元、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價慘跌不已</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外滙迭鬆、跌風更勁、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本　七十五元半、跌去二元、外　七十五元、跌一元半、轉口貨降度相同、為五十八元半至五十九元、荷棉白降元許、BM　為七十二元八角、荷赤又降九許、現貨五十六元至五十五元九角、路貨五十元六角、太古車白B　七址三元四角、DY　七十一元四角、均降六角、HY　七十一元四角、至七十一元、降一元、</p>
<h3>煤炭鴻基屑加四元</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤屑、日前自新貨大批抵埠以後、（己誌前報）人心安定、市氣轉穩、　當此外滙放長聲中、成本自然减輕、不意日昨某行開盤、同業拆價、一律加高四元、計開鴻基二號屑（煤球原料）每噸一百二十四元、棧房自車、行槓外加、反常行動、實出意外、</p>

<h3>紗花　棉紗何為乎暴漲　踢來踢去還是皮球交易為大宗　關進關出依然實際去路仍平淡　將後要想出籠深恐難於登靑天</h3>
<p>此　番棉紗漲出一千二百元關外、情緒異常熱烈、揆其原因、簡述如左、</p>
<p>（一）滬埠金融界鑒於游資充斥、實行减息、</p>
<p>（二）緬甸封鎖綫不久開放、恢復行　、</p>
<p>（三）本歲新棉雖吿豐收、來源被某方所把持、而受阻礙、</p>
<p>（四）傳聞已久之某取引所、自十月一日正式宣吿成立、實行開幕營業、一般投機界閑散已久、無法活動、籍題大爲發揮掀風作浪之伎倆、根本問題還係取引所開始拍板、一般賣方將日紗搜羅、吸收一批、將其以作籌碼之需用、可使市塲進進出出、交易方可流通、於是根子一緊、二十支藍鳳月琴兩牌首先上漲、人心衝動、天津帮及證劵金子帮紛紛蠢動、大家你拖我扯、一致撈進、照此情景、籌碼一時當然不敷分配、星期五六某所宜吿兩度漲停板、由此投機界興高彩烈、「多頭莫不望天坍」、至於實際交易已顯退落之象、每日每市除香港帮辦五六百包、至多一千包、查上週總成交二萬六千八百九十包、其中香港帮買去僅四千四百七十包、所謂同行成交、皮球踢來滾去、交易倒有二萬二千三百九十包、檢討每天成交之數由二千包增至四千包、本日皮球成交竟有五千四百餘包、可想近日投機化之劇烈也、豈料好景不常、昨日漲峯復見一千二百十七元、國際消息不利、外匯大長特長、法幣基礎愈固、黄金大挫、洋商股票慘落、於此多頭陣綫顯著搖動之勢、所以一霎間跌至一千一百六十五元、然大衆心理、吸收之額、仍不願放棄、不過存貨仍在三十萬包外、目前各方之出路、旣狹隘而困難、至於棉布需要愈滯、本埠小規模之布廠、仍乏生路、停頓者依然未能恢復工作、現今一千二百元、比六月二十八日越南問題緊張時二十支雙馬次價爲八百元、已漲高四百元、增至百分之五十、查匯票美票縮至五元〇九三七五、昨日價為五元六五六二五、就以上情形論之棉紗、上檔價格業已可說走至盡頭了、然一般人心尙屬十分興奮、市塲議論一致樂觀、目前籌碼被大家關住、裂痕尙不致實現、所以決不肯懸崖勒馬、且國際局勢變化莫測、將後要想出籠、深恐難於登天也、（山）</p>
<h3>環境日劣　紗價乃跌</h3>
<p>紗　市始漲繼跌、但趨勢已入混亂狀態中，實緣時局緊張、外滙大長特長、故多頭雖堅意看好、然環境所不許、因之人心虛弱、買方陣綫不若前日之穩定、然市塲皮球成交、日見增高、每天終在四五千包之多、可想將後變化範圍擴大矣、昨有紗七百八十件運港、今日有六十件運厦門、一千八百二十五件運港、</p>
<p>現　紗晨開、因上日多頭散播空氣、一致　叫喊拉提、首盤在升至一千二百元、此時買氣依然堅强、一霎間聞消息不利多方、外滙放長允劇、黄金大落、賣氣忽熾跌至一千一百六十三元、但多方某某又來拉提、軍漲至一千一百八十二元、惟吃戶不旺、又吿軟化，迨至收盤價爲一千一百七十九元、收盤以後因消息不良、直下二十元賣不出、查半日間成交統計六千二百〇三包、行情跌二十元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　五·四〇〇　福州　三</p>
<p>香港　八〇〇　統計六、二〇三包</p>
<h3>廠方觀望　棉花祇同行看好</h3>
<p>現　棉交易稍旺、但廠方絕少舉動、同行人心看好、因來源不通、然外滙奇長、金價慘落、允使棉市進退維谷之局面也、今日有棉花三百五十五件運香港、</p>
<p>巴西二八〇·〇〇　大信進　一五〇件</p>
<p>又　二七七·〇〇　慶太進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>奧姆拉二〇二·〇〇　森太進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>米特林二九二·〇〇　源興德　一〇〇件</p>
<p>白洛去二三六·〇〇　長興進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>平果爾一五七·〇〇　陶鼎記　一〇〇件</p>
<p>大中集二五七·〇〇　仁昌進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>以下補上日</p>
<p>白洛去三二·〇〇　申九進四〇〇件</p>
<p>平果爾一六　·〇〇　裕大進一〇〇件</p>
<p>另　訊外棉市價、紐约棉市市况靜寂，因華商街之軟弱、及一部份之反動者賣出、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌三五磅音印度連同預測、昨日降落五羅比、</p>
<p>滬　埠外棉交易、昨日較形靜寂、因遠東之形勢轉爲嚴重、各方俱抱觀望態度、雖昨日交易不多、乃因滬上存底不豐、故售價仍未能轉鬆也、一一般意見、俱認市况稍有轉機後、棉市將見漲也、</p>
<h3>五金　船鋼板步緊</h3>
<p>尤以厚花色爲俏</p>
<p>船鋼板自船廠家遷散後、遂吿零星、最近北幫時有搜辦、兼之本街對於厚花色需胃允切、市氣一振、人心遂吿活潑、標準較之前市有漲無落、（允以厚花色爲甚）刻市售盤爲二厘半喊八十元、半分售七十元、七厘半沽六十七元、而一分亦須六十五元云、</p>
<p>又日前所刋「一分花色售五十元」實每担沽六十元、乃當時所報之誤也、特此更正、</p>
<h3>海味　西海參到銷不寂</h3>
<p>西洋海參、邇來到銷不寂、昨日又售開一抵、計望加錫揀條玉參六百二十一元、一號玉五百七十八元、二號玉五百二十八元、三號玉四百六十八元、四號四百〇五元、五號三百五十五元、小玉二百五十一元、又揀條赤參二百五十六元、一號赤二百二十二元、二號赤一百九十三元、三號一百七十三元、四號一百五十六元、小赤參一百四十八元、成價俱比前稍堅、</p>
<h3>暹淡張六七元</h3>
<p>暹暹淡菜、近日到有一批、花色俱備、而去化亦頗不惡、刻市大中淡售二百〇七元、大淡二百十二元、出辦二百二十八元、比前須漲起六七元、</p>
<h3>麟菜市存稀少</h3>
<p>麒菜市存虛薄、似有求過於供之勢、市價遂挺進十分之一、刻龍牙菜售五十五元、西蘭菜五十八元、武敦菜五十二元、貨允缺少、獅毛六十四元、</p>
<h3>戰後的中國蠶絲業　（續四日）</h3>
<p>— 施翔</p>
<p>尙有冒險賒欠之小廠，其資金本屬有限，以六萬元爲流動者照市價最多僅可收鮮繭一百五六十担，合之乾繭约五十餘担，而有冒險收貨，逾其原資本一倍者，所收鮮繭雖爲三百担而負債則已平添六萬元矣，鄉民待收繭結束，卽索舊欠，廠商無法週轉，致貨物被扣，不准出境，於是糾紛事件，層出不窮，廠商走頭無路，一面以高利貸款應敷，（錫地絲繭借款利率最高者曾至按月五分利息）一面以賤價拋貨，接收定洋，携鄕彌補，並立刻籌備開車，如是方有小批乾繭運廠，以所出生絲易款後，復赴鄕贖繭經營之困難，於此可見。</p>

<h3>騰衝水力測勘記</h3>
<p>— 大學組第一各　粟翼寰</p>
<p>本文目次</p>
<p>（甲）　留下關一月　測洱河水力</p>
<p>（乙）　保山十日游　拜謁武侯祠</p>
<p>（丙）遵騰保古道　乘滑竿長征</p>
<p>訪徐霞客游踪　是夜宿蒲縹邑</p>
<p>窺河床之構造　攀登高黎貢山</p>
<p>盆地梯田環布　橄欖寨　角聲</p>
<p>大雨排山倒海　到目的地騰衝</p>
<p>勘疊水河瀑布　完成測量工作</p>
<p>今年春，騰衝士紳欲利用該縣疊水河瀑布建設水力發電廠建議於雲南全省經濟委員會，經委會嘉其請，遂敦聘國立西南聯合大學工學院長兼資源委員會雲南省水力發電勘測隊指導工程師施嘉煬先生主持其事。及七月，學校放暑假，施先生乃遺余與同學陳其亨廖仲周二君，先往該縣調查疊水河水力情况，並測量兩岸詳細情形，以便爲設計廠渠之根據，余等因有騰衝之行。</p>
<p>留下關一月　測洱河水力</p>
<p>余等於六月二十八日由昆明乘滇緬公路局客車啟行，以車輛時生障碍，路上躭擱一日，三十日晚始抵下關。卽宿滇緬路局招待所，因順便勘測洱河一帶水力情形，留下關工作過一月之久。</p>
<p>洱河（圖一）爲洱　之出口，經下關至漾濞（圖二）與漾濞江滙流而歸於瀾滄江。下關黑龍橋河面寬八十公尺，水深平均一公尺左右，由本年七月十五日所測之結果，知高水時期流量的爲40　O．M．S．（每秒鐘立方公尺數）；自黑龍橋而下西行的五百公尺，水流始急，河床亦漸狹窄，僅及三十公尺，坡降在0．7％上下；再行二公里至天半橋，河在兩山深谷閒穿過，形勢極爲險要，相傳漢諸葛武侯征蠻時，四擒蠻王孟獲於此，爲點蒼山之最低缺口處，西南氣流多由此吹入大理平原，造成下關多風原因。谷中最狹處僅三公尺，兩岸有巨石突出相接，形如一橋，人可跨越而過，故名曰天生橋。（圖三）河水由橋底深谷間流過，初以爲如此狹谷，水流必極湍急，孰知其流反較上下游爲緩，的爲1．5m＼sec想見其河底必有深淵，吾則卽兩岸石崖下必有較大空隙。再前三百公尺，水中巨石突起，使水翻騰奔躍，水沫噴起如雪花，石前河水下跌深至八九公尺，遙視頗爲壯觀，土人呼爲不謝梅，以其終年有白花也。人以其爲跌水，水力必偉，前會由地方人士延西門子公司人員勘察，計劃發電，以經費缺乏，未獲結果。近資源委員會擬於該處建立一小型發電廠，以供大理下關鳳儀漾濞四處電流，擬建電廠區域附近之詳細地形圖，已由余等測得，當地人士望眼欲穿之水電廠，不久卽可動工修築矣。</p>
<p>由天生橋下溯三公里，水流盡在谷底石牀間傾瀉，下行水中亂石磷殉，激水成浪，滾翻映耀，平順處則又一泓碧水，異常豁目；河身彎曲，蜿蜒趨西南流水面寬自二十至四十公尺不等，坡降的在2％以上，河兩岸壁多峻急，但傾度均勻，平地絕少。　巒起伏，樹木鬱葱，間有縣泉瀑布，飛嗽　間，風景殊爲幽美。右岸高出水面的三十公尺，滇緬公路在焉。左岸則有舊日驛道，不時仍聞鸞鈴響亮其間。沿河地質，左岸多紫色泥崖，右岸多花崗石，石塊巨大，紋理細密，質亦堅固，現在公路所用之拱橋·涵洞·及附近村舍建築石料，均係就地採取，至爲方便，後溯河下行十公里，至鐵索橋，俗稱四十里橋，西距漾濞四十華里；又稱鍊子橋，係用鐵索八根繫兩岸間，上覆木板，以渡人馬；橋長十八公尺，寬3．6公尺。橋下水面高度為一五七〇公尺低於下關水面400公尺、再前六公里，至平坡，洱河　漾濞江滙流而入於瀾滄江；（圖四）滙流處寬的二十公尺，平均水深1公尺，水面高程一三八〇公尺，計低於下關水面六百公尺，兩地水平距離爲21．5公里，故總平均水面坡降達3．0％，水力蘊藏之富，殊屬駭人。</p>
<p>保山十日游　拜謁武候祠</p>
<p>迄七月十八日，余等在下關工作，已全部完畢，適服務於紅十字會醫藥運輸隊之同學張君來招待所，謂有運輸車多輛將空放保山，余等遂携儀器行李繼續西進，當晚過永平，三十日下午抵保山城，仍下榻公路局招待所，該所係滇緬路局委託中國旅行社所辦，設城北太保山上，（圖五）爲玉皇閣舊址，風景幽美，樹木暢茂，有翠微樓，憑軒可鳥瞰保山平原，爲保山十八景之一；故昔人飲宴，多假該處，現招待所仍用爲餐廳。綜計滇緬路招待所，應以此處風景爲佳矣。</p>
<p>余等留保山凡十日，得因於閑暇時週遊覽各　名勝學校，登太保山，謁武侯祠，渦龍泉橋，臨易雜池，嚐湧珠泉，履梨花隔，遊石華洞，游騰銜會館（圖六），父承當地人士慇勤招待，得參觀國立華僑中學，省立保山師　，與縣立中小學各學校，睹邊陲敎育之日趨進步，實令人與奮無已，而美景怡人，賞心悅目，胸襟一曠</p>
<p>遵騰保古道　乘滑竿長征</p>
<p>由保山西至騰衝，尙無汽車可通；當滇緬公路修築時，保山以西，原有南綫北綫兩計劃：南綫，卽由保山折西南行，經龍陵，芒市，遮放，畹町以入緬境而通腊戌。北綫，卽由保山西行，循騰保古道以達騰衝，經蓮山以通緬屬八莫。以氣候及商務論，此綫較優，唯當時南綫所屬芒市遮放一帶，因當地土司已築有一段車路，當局爲節省經費起見，利用該路，遂決採用南綫計劃，騰衝人士，曾因此力爭，終無效果。近聞騰衝士紳，以便利交通，爲發展百業要圖，而溝通邊陲，允爲增强國防先著，業已商得保山人士同意，決由兩縣民衆，自動籌款，修築騰保公路，該項工程，聞已開始數月，成續頓佳，近因時値農忙，又逢雨季，故已暫停一作，預計八月中秋左右，又可繼續開工，若無特殊困難發生，則一年後，孔道可通，不獨騰保間之商務將因此益　繁盛，卽外地人士之來遊騰衝者，亦可無復連日跋涉之古矣。</p>
<p>基於上述，故余等此次由保入騰，以乘滑竿循騰保古道西行，騰保兩地咸爲我國邊陲絕徼之區，其問橫亘怒山及高黎貢兩大山脈，分爲潞江及龍川江之分水嶺，地勢險峻，小道盤旋上下於高山深谷茂林曠地間，跋涉極爲艱苦；余由地圖量得兩縣間之直綫距離僅一五〇里，而實際所行旅程達三百餘里之多，其曲折情形，可以想見。由保山乘滑竿啟程赴騰衝，需時四日，第一日行七十里，午飯冷水菁，夜宿淸縹邑。第二日行九　里，越怒山，過潞江，晚宿高黎貢山之老寨，全路行程以此日爲最長最苦。第三日晨發老寨，午飯於高黎貢山巔之平河村，下越龍川江，再坡行十里抵橄欖寒而宿焉，行程八址里，跋涉之苦，僅稍亞於第二日。第四日由橄欖寨繼續爬坡上行，午飯于芹菜塘，由此下行，路途乃較平坦，再越一小坡，騰衝平原卽在目矣。午後三時卽達縣城；艱苦旅途，至此乃吿結束。此係行程大概情形，至若沿途見聞及宿膳狀况，於下文述之</p>

<p>余等於八月八日離保山，所乘滑竿，係先一日於城中僱來者，因行李儀器過多，另僱挑夫四人，轎夫六入，共爲十人；每人力資議定爲新滇票五十元，合國幣二十五元。彼等悉爲川人，初持滑竿來招待所時，形容枯槁，滿面黧黑，余頗憂其不克勝此跋涉，旣見渠等綁紥行李，又互相推諉，輕至一鞋一帽，亦以擲他人担上爲快，舉止卑鄙，令人生厭。嗣後彼等吿余曰，我等均係川軍郭汝梀部屬，二十五年隨軍人滇剿匪，被遣散於水昌之北，渠等流落異鄕，欲歸不得，遂不得不出賣勞力以資生活。</p>
<p>渠等又酷嗜鴉片，每人各私具一小布囊，內藏烟槍烟燈各物，行路時每至一處，輒覓處橫陳，享其呑雲吐霧之樂，竟置旅客行稈於不顧，非屢加催促，決不啟行；余前曾讀英伯克夫人所著中縛之交一書，內言中國轎夫，每行二三小時，卽需大吸鴉片，以爲係外人描寫，不免誇大其詞；不料今日竟親目覩此情景，始知伯克夫人之語，盡係學實，現雖經當局限期禁絕，嚴厲執行，而若輩能吾覺悟，脫離黑籍，尙未可知也。</p>
<p>訪徐霞客游踪　是夜宿蒲縹邑</p>
<p>余等於八月八日淸晨六時起身，所僱滑竿夫役，原應七時卽來，但遲至八時後，始姗姗而至，綑紥行李，又復費時，故至九時半，始克啓行。余等由鎭南門出城後，沿滇緬公路西行叫公里，卽上騰保古道，時値陰露密佈，細雨冥濛，十時過諸葛堰，堰在道右，草堤十里，以石塊堆砌而成，相傳係諸葛征南蠻時所築，用以屯紥軍隊者。再右爲九隆崗，以山勢起伏成九巒故名。峯巒迤邐，樹木淸秀，風景至佳。堰山之間，平疇一片，雨水多時，貯此成湖，土人呼爲大海子。至山坡之上，房屋櫛比，炊烟起處，則打漁村也。半時過二十五里鋪，轎夫請歇哨，遂下轎，歇半小時再行，十分鐘過西遊山石華洞；華僑中學敎職員邀余等在此遊玩洞在道右山下，一名芭蕉洞；洞口有木柵門，內奉觀音大士，有齋公守之。是日余等分秉火把，松明，電筒入內，入口右折處，洞頂有蝙蝠窠，蝙蝠見火光起，爭相飛遁，吱喳亂嗚，不計其數，勢頗可畏；洞內岐道甚多，益以路滑難行，雖僱土人嚮導，仍未敢深入，的行里許折回，終未能窮其究竟也。洞中多石鐘乳，奇形異狀，若傘若牛，若虎若豹，彷彿雕塑；石壁磷　，閃爍發光，以手捫之，淸沁入骨；至一處，嚮導以大石重擊其地，則聲起如雷，轟然震耳，土人稱爲石鼓，霞客滇遊日記稱洞下有洞，當卽指此。</p>
<p>路過洞而西，險峻難行，蓋以雨後土滑，轎夫掙扎其間，殊費氣力，及達山頂時，已正午，乃停道旁休息，余出氣壓高度計視之，則已上登二百餘公尺，蓋保山平原海拔的一七〇〇公尺，而斯時指針談數爲一九五〇公尺也。歇半小時繼續前行，時天上霧氣盡散，已有晴意，又以道路稍平，余等乃下橋步行，一路盡係黃土地層，雨後濕潤，益縣其美，行半小時，以路漸泥濘，始復上轎，坡最高處海拔的爲二一三〇公尺，由此轉向下行，二時半抵達冷水等，高度計談數爲二〇五〇公尺，該處四面環山，峯高林茂，路側有茅屋數橡，兼買飯菜，因卽飯焉。白飯每碗索資新滇幣四毛，合國幣二角；飯菜僅火腿醃肉兩樣，每小碟售新滇幣一元五角，味道尙佳。飯時遇二客，一姓革，一姓何，皆騰衝縣人，新自保山經商歸者，詢知余等係往騰衝籌設水電廠，卽深表歡迎之意，並的同時啓行，迄三時許，再行；由此山勢復向上走，半小時後，卽見怒山，高黎貢山，重疊橫在於前，高山靑淡，怒山蔚藍，晴嵐疊疊，山外有山，無異一幅天然圖畫。山下有小平原，轎夫謂余曰，蒲縹在望矣！余取望遠鏡視之。果見前有小鎮，飛　簇聚，隱的於綠樹叢林間。轎夫遂循山坡小路蜿蜒下降，健步如飛，已不復似登山時之緩步徐行矣，未幾，卽達平地，視手錶才五時也。</p>
<p>鎭口有照壁門，白墻黑字，額曰「蒲縹古邑」左書「龍吟虎嘯」右書鶴舞鴛飛門雖小而不失其威嚴，墻雖薄而整潔可愛；旣入鎮門，便見長街一道，房屋櫛比，轎夫舁余等至德興公寓而下榻焉。</p>
<p>蒲縹本爲荒地，英時蒲人漂人來此聚居，故名蒲縹；迄明太祖定鼎，始入中國版圖，隸永昌郡。鎮爲長方形，北平寳街爲其主幹，街南有小巷，大抵民居，市中房屋原極整齊，今春失愼，被火焚燬者甚夥，以是碎瓦頽垣，所在皆是；邊陲小鎭，缺乏消防設備，災難一至，不可收拾。鎭西端有南津河，流水一灣，頗爲淸澈，河上架木橋如走廊形，余等傍晚往遊，同立橋上，北瞰北斗小熊，南　羯千人馬，橋下河水低流，悠然遠云，偶爾微風吹來，便聞遠處水碓　舉之聲，靜中有動，極饒幽趣；美景良宵，衆皆忘返，至更深，露濕始折歸旅舍。蒲縹以產蒜頭著名，允以鎭中春和齋所製甜蒜頭風行各處。</p>
<p>是晚余等十時許始就寢；正酣睡間，忽爲鸞鈴震醒，便聞牛馬的達經過樓下，雜以御夫叱斥之聲，余等咸訝犬明何速，而隔室旅客目高呼茶房打水洗臉，少頃聞茶房懶懶回話，曰「此老牛過街也，牛畏熱，白日不能趕路，故夜間起行，時方夜半，客母躁耶？」余以電筒照錶視之，果方　時，遂復人睡。</p>
<p>窺河床之構造　攀登高黎貢山</p>
<p>翌日晨五時半興，盥洗畢，卽進早餐，在該店一宿兩餐，每人收費國幣三元五角。七時半首途，過南津河，步行爬一坡，路側常見保騰公路測量隊所定水準高程點（Bench　Mark），行一小時，</p>

<p>達山頂，該處海拔爲一五〇〇公尺，遂上轎，由轎夫舁而下行，是時山中曉霧茶濃，樹影模糊，雲山縹渺，四野恬靜，萬嶺無聲，閑坐轎中，唯聞轎夫脚踏泥沙，喳喳作嚮，步武整齊，耐人尋味。九時廿分抵馬廠，叫聞香稻，三五人家，儼然成一小村，轎夫請歇哨，遂下轎，時値有人舉辦喪事，村中人咸集一處，喪家沿路設席款待客人；余等方歇茶舖吃茶，孝子亦來邀請入席，幾經婉辭始罷。十時再行，山此漸入草莽地帶，人在樹叢中行，藤蔓蜿蜒，雜草無序，十一時歇一峽谷旁，石壁如削，水流激嚮；下望千似，駭目驚心。已而啓行，卽沿谷岸下降，路因坡度太大，築成梯階形，下行永半，谷底視界遂漸寬敞，余更取望遠鏡視之，河牀之構造，水流之緩急，莫不纖維畢露，河牀亦如山道，自然成階梯下降，每一階下，水冲積成一池塘。河水循階下流，色凡三變，當其流經石階上時，因水淸石黃，故呈黃色；及山石階下墜，飛湍急激白如瀑布；嗣貯塘底，以水積較深，父呈碧玉色矣！出此復行階上，重顯黃色，如此　色循環，益以水紋多變，釀成奇景，顧而樂之。復行半小時，谷勢開展，遙見高黎貢山蔚然在望，十二時十五分過亦惠橋，溯谷右下行，左側山勢已漸平坦，峯巒靑萃，淺草如茵，十一時半以氣候漸熱，歇路側黃槲樹下，樹大十抱，枝葉濃茂，幹上果實纍纍，形狀如花紅。倚樹下望，潞江一泓如帶。一時冉行，循路急降，一時卽達江邊，江寬二白公尺，江心築大橋礅，以鐵索橋二連通兩岸；東　曰惠人橋，河岸石壁上刻其名，西岸曰潞江橋，有前國務總理李根源先生題「滬水」匾。二橋　騰　商會改修，橫跨大江，勢　雄偉，江水灰色，流速湍急，開附近有諸葛丞相碑，余等以倉促經過，不克訪求其遺跡。殊爲憾事。</p>
<p>過橋有小鎭，卽瀘江鎭屬瀘江土司管領。余等至時，適逢街子，附近土人咸集於此，互爲貿易；內多擺夷黎索。擺夷，酷似越人，長衣黑齒，婦人以靑布盤頭頂成高帽，形狀怪異：余昔嘗聞人言，擺夷少女顏色極佳（圖七），明眸皓齒，楚楚可人，白衣靑裙，益增妍美，故土人有　夷好看眞好看，漢人好看粉裝扮　之語，然擺夷風俗，少女經出嫁，卽開始仟意咀嚼草烟檳榔，使齒染黑，不復再保護其天然美；故土入又有「少時像觀昔，老來如猴子」之語。是日余等所遇者大抵婦人，所謂擺夷之　女美，終未得見。黎索亦爲夷人之一種，包頭赤足，裝飾滿身，多爲銀圈蛤壳之屬，喜着靑衣，褲脚極小；見余等過，咸注目相視，嘖嘖耳語，余等原以異族視渠等，豈知渠等亦以余儕爲其欣賞之目的物耶！</p>
<p>瀘江海拔僅七〇〇公尺，較之蒲縹已低下七白餘公尺，故氣候極熱，同行諸人，莫不汗下如雨，商旅過此，咸以少食爲戒，故余等　啖餅乾數枚以充午點。土人又會吿余，謂由保山至騰衝三百里中，時有瘴氣，考其原因，或係日夜溫度變遷太大，外人不知，易受感冒，非眞有所謂瘴癘在也。</p>
<p>余等於三時離瀘江，乃開始爬高黎貢山，山路蜿蜒於藤蔓中，兩側草木屛立，高逾人頂，叢中時聞泉水潺潺之聲，四時許見巒勒河，峽谷千仭，自山谷迤邐南下，河中灘多水急，水激石嗚如萬馬奔騰；駭人心目。沿河左側行，五時過濟義橋，卽登山數白尺，達一峯頂，蠻勒河己在脚下，濟義橋且小至不可復見矣。時銀月一鈎，已懸天際，長空如洗，凈無片雲，長嘯聲，山嗚谷應。</p>
<p>山此下一小谷，復向上行，山中林木益茂，盤根錯節，糾葛相連，雖樹大如碗，亦互相盤紥，成絞絲形。山路面峽背山，勢殊險峻，峽谷千似，石壁如削，紹巘多生怪　，懸泉瀑布，飛漱其間，時聞猿猴長嘯，秋蟄低嗚，聲倍凄切。谷中多竹，由谷底成叢上生，幹纖且長，多爲枝葉垂負成弓形，兩兩相對，形如拱橋，靑翠可愛，山中人卽編竹爲廬，以作居室；又有破竹爲管，綿延里許罷，以引山泉於家內者。行行重行，余等於六時半，始　宿站老寨，寨在山腰，海拔公一四九〇尺；山潞江至此，總計共登七百餘公尺，攀援之苦，可以想見。余等所歇逆旅主人姓寸，自言其先人寸大進，曾傾其家產，改修高黎貢山路，經—年之辛苦，親自督導工人，一面開路，一而施茶，坡峻者使之平，路狹者使之闊，卒如其忐，便利後人；此種急公好義舍己爲人之精神，誠足令後人敬佩。余見其門首粘有春聯云「數白年崎嶇道途，修成平坦：幾千里跋涉商旅，到此平安，」實可謂之無愧。是日共山行九十里，因勞頓過甚，就寢較早。</p>
<p>盆地梯田環布　橄欖寨號角聲</p>
<p>十日晨六時起身，早餐後，每人付餐宿費國幣一元五角，八時啟　，繼續登山，視山石多水成岩，年久風化，質極鬆脆，試以手杖叩之，卽剝落如雪片下；路上多沙，雲母閃爍，意卽山石風化成者。十時達海拔二二〇〇公尺處，遇小雨，片刻卽止，樹木經微雨沐後，柔潤益甚，翠濃將滴；登高望西北諸山，咸深藏濃霧中，不復可睹。已而陽光自雲叩出，回望谷中，水汽悠然自下上升，余光照處，映成白雲，瀰漫百里，羣峯隱的其間，懸浮如海上小島；余曾聞峨嵋雲海，心饗已久，惜無緣得見，不圖於高黎貢山之巔得睹斯景，亦足以稍飽眼福而饜旅懷矣！</p>
<p>—一時達平河寨，是爲高黎貢山之巔，拔海凡二三一斤公尺，午飯於路側小舖，菜四碟，悉爲馬鈴薯，唯製法各殊，色味相異，淸脆可口，莫不讀嘆主人手藝之奇巧。飯後下山，坡峻溝多，益以雨後泥濘，極難行走，不幸途中又遭陣雨襲擊，一時雨水瀰漫，山樹盡藏，寒冷殊甚，余枯坐轎中，手且麻木。三時山勢漸開，雲霧盡掃，見前有盆地窩，山坡小村棋佈，四圍梯田，環佈靑翠齊整，風景至佳，遙望龍江，時隱時現。旣下山，經石板大道，平坦整潔，行走其上，步履輕快，未及五時，卽抵江邊籠江，一名龍川江，自北蜿蜒南來，河幅狹小，流量僅的潞江三分之一，惟海拔高潞江六〇〇公尺，以是水流甚急，波濤洶湧，江水直下，大有一瀉千里之勢，余等歇稅局半小時，始過橋，上坡再行十里，達橄欖寨而歇焉，時方五時四十分。</p>
<p>橄欖寨屬騰衝縣，倚山築鎭，房屋頗多，形式稍類蒲縹，然不如蒲縹　潔。余等方坐旅店休息，忽聞村外角聲大鳴，悠揚震耳，出戶視之，則見一隊農夫，簑衣雨笠，排隊自田間來，一人持三角形大紅旗前導，上書「橄欖寨耘幟」諸字，店主人吿余，謂渠等係自田問耕耘歸者；蓋其地高出海面一五三〇公尺，地勢高峻，又復背山面河，氣候寒冷，以是秧期較遲，時　農歷七月，視其禾苗，方及尺許耳！</p>
<p>大雨排山倒海　到目的地騰衝</p>
<p>十一日晨八時出發，仍循石徑登山，時値曉霧重重，萬峯皆隱，空中水汽允斥，汗不得出，爬山半時，遍身煩熱，九時小雨，傷遇泥路，濘滑難行，行數里歇哨海拔二〇〇〇公尺處，半時再行，復衝　三〇公尺，於十時半上騰越人十新修公路，路傍山腰西行，寬可容四東道，地質多沙，疑係岩石風化　成，殊利築路，然余等過時，適値農忙，父逢雨季，故已暫時停工，沿途十里，不見一人。十一時半，重登小路，自此路益滑，泥益深，觀滑竿夫蹌踉其間，倍爲艱苦；天公復不作美，未及正午，大雨突下，倒海排山，勢如雷電，轎夫無奈，不得不</p>

<p>冒險急行，幸祇數分鐘，卽趕至芹菜塘，然衣履已經透濕矣。隨就路側小舖避雨。候店中凡兩小時，雨勢始稍衰弱，然路中泥水已貯集盈尺，泛濫爲小河，俟水退盡，又半小時，力再啟程。由此傍山下行，因雨後泥濘，轎夫顚仆泥淖中者再，行路之苦，殊難訴述。但不久山勢卽漸平坦，天亦漸有霽色，四時又越一坡，遂遙見騰越牛原在谷底矣！轎夫示余縣城方向，余取望遠鏡視之，果於雲樹之間，隱見雉堞。及行較近，里　市屋，亦皆逐漸入目，轎夫更遙指城郊白色建築，某吿余爲海關，某爲鎭署，至爲詳盡。四時半過倪家舖，折右行百餘步，復折左過一長堤，卽見牌樓一座，金碧輝煌，巍然相向。轎夫吿余，是爲接官亭，離城五里，爲昔日官員迎送之所；余等方欣賞間，忽有紳士趨滑竿前，自言係縣商會秘書，奉謝會長命，來迎接余等者。余等聞言，慌忙下轎，卽隨其步行入城，達五保街縣商會而歇焉。總計由昆明赴騰衝，旅程凡一千五百餘里，至是始吿結束。</p>
<p>是晚，承謝式南會長設宴招待，並邀各界人十相陪，余等皆在學齡，少歷世事，偶然受此熱烈歡迎，至爲侷促。席間談及水力發電廠興辦事宜，在座諸人，莫不盼望水電廠能早成立，以奠定邊城工業基礎，余以興辦地方公益事業，能得「人和」如此，前途殊屬業觀，</p>
<p>勘疊水河瀑布　完成測量工作</p>
<p>翌日，下午二時，卽由商會李事務長領導余等往疊水河瀑布附近踏勘；疊水河在縣城西南一里，其水目赤土羅生諸山來流爲大盈江，下經南甸，南過千崖，出關合蠻莫河，入於南大金沙江，終循阿瓦城以入於海，跌水處石壁巉削，斷懸百餘丈，崖頭巨石蹲立若門，江流至此，衝激奔馳，乃懸空而墜，如散雪花，擘棉絮，垂珠簾，走玉飛花，噴雲吐沫，灑人衣面，土人稱爲「久雨不晴」。倚崖有老樹一株，千歲物也，根無纖土，色若靑銅古鐵，被以落衣，斑駁鱗次，結屈盤錯，由石罅中蟠旋而出，老幹偃伏，若虬龍驤首奮起，高七尺餘，大至十餘圍。有巨石一，畏的八尺，高三尺，中闊五尺，狀若巨龜，某顱嵌入老樹尺許，僅露頸領，身與樹凡合成一體，老幹分聳四出，椏枝凌空，細葉奇姿，亭亭崖上，下俯深潭，奔流怒吼，時徇震撼，而挺立千載不隨波流以俱逝者，當以有此龜石與之盤錯故也。稍上有太極橋，橫跨瀑頭，山川水鎭，勢殊雄偉，右岸山脈逶迤，突起奇峯，峯頂建有飛閣，臨流揖瀑，是爲龍光台，蒼崖翠巘，環抱拱立，秀木倚攢，芳草褥織，左岸靑壁陡抱，駢立下注，有峯翼然，白衣閣廢址在焉，與毘盧寺浮圖相對峙，塔景山光，流霞漂霰，交互輝映，風景極佳。水自瀑底下流，坡降仍極陡峻，河中亂石縱橫，激水生浪，澎湃奔騰，迄下流的七〇〇公尺處，水面始稍平靜。是河瀑布附近一帶，蘊藏水力，至爲雄偉，足見山川鍾秀，無地無之，特此瀑僻處天末，未爲世人所注音耳。此次雲南全省經濟委員會特撥大宗款項，在此建設水力發電廠，實具遠大目光，邊陲工業將因此廠之成立，漸趨發達，而浩浩江水，大施展布，亦不致再日夜喧嘩叫屈至！</p>
<p>余等測量工作，自十三日開始，前後共費時二十餘日，計地形測量六日，河面縱剖面測量一日，河上下游壩址水深測量二日，立水標尺及流量測量日，四鄕”縣城輸電綫路測量七日，曲道定綫測量一日，計算及繪圖七日，迄目前止，應作工作，大抵已經完成，而學校開學日期，亦已迫於眉切，故爲小使功課躭誤計，余等卽趕歸昆明。綜計此次暑假三月以來，余等或跋涉山野之巔，或工作流水之側，時與大自然相接近，自覺見識增進殊多，髒魄亦更强健，較之昔年假期，閑處家中，無所事事者，有益筆矣！茲值假期將終，閒學期近，爰說記憶所及，挑燈命筆，聊復書此，欲以留紀念於日後也。　（完）</p>

<p>桌子上放着兩隻磁碗，裏面滿盛着暗黑色的流質，在光綫不足的辦公室中閃爍地發出一縷縷的金光，本善和我就站在桌前寫招生廣吿，每人手裏拿了一管筆，分別蘸在自己面前的那碗流質裏。看上去兩碗好像是屬於同一種色調，但當飽含着液體的筆毛落到那四開的白報紙上時，顏色就顯然地分別出來：我所寫的是紅色，而本善所寫的則是藍色，我在每張白紙上寫了：</p>
<p>請識字的　去勸吿　不識字的　快來讀書</p>
<p>以及「資格」，「學費」，「報名日期」，「校址」等字後，交給本善，經他的藍筆加上了「麥倫民衆學校招生」和「八歲以上十四歲以下」等字樣，一張廣吿就變了下面的樣子而完成了。</p>
<p>每當寫了十來張時，大家就放下筆來，拭拭額角上的汗珠，交換了一下微笑，這也是一種相互的慰藉，在那光綫不足的小房子裏，我可以看見他底大眼在黑暗中放射出一種帶着愉快而堅毅的光芒，這更給予我一個鼓勵。</p>
<p>白紙堆的高度一點點的减低，而寫成的廣吿一張張的增加成厚厚的一疊，的摸五小時的功夫，我們已完成的一百張同樣的廣吿，這時我們放了筆，揉了揉手，振奮的心情，早已把手腕的酸痛都忘掉了。</p>
<p>第二天的淸早，大家帶起草帽，背着漿糊桶和掃帚，挾了一疊廣吿，我們就權當招貼員了。</p>
<p>我們的對象是—民衆特別是工人和窮苦人家的小孩，所以我們的招生廣吿並不需要在寬大平坦的柏油馬路旁的電桿，樹木，或牆壁上被發現，我們所到的是「高尙」人士所不屑走，也從不走的區域。這裏只有破舊的草棚，低矮的平房，所見的只有短衣赤足或赤膊的勞苦大衆，以及渾身不掛一絲的小孩。當我們開始工作時，他們都帶了奇異的眼光，對我們這班不常光臨的貴客行注目禮，有的竟直接詢問我們廣告的內容，這種機會自然不能錯過，當下我們就立卽加以解釋，說明我們是爲民衆學校招生而來的，我們那邊不收學費，不限年齡，同時我們並個別的詢問他們有多少小孩，願吾到我們那邊來，有的馬上就答應送他的小孩來念書，有的說因為路途太速，有的說他底小孩因爲要做工（如工廠裹的童工，拾荒及小販）的關係，不能前來，但我們都加以番的勸導，成績倒也不十分使人失望。</p>
<p>與招生廣吿同時進行的另一方面的招生工作，是召集了民校上學期的學生，給予他們種職責，那就是叫他們去勸吿他們的隣居及親友來唸書，同時並酌量給他們些招生廣吿，叫他們在居什的區域周圍張貼，對於這一個使命，他們是很高興熱烈地接受了。結果也是很美滿的。</p>
<p>隔了一天，在規定的報名時間之前，校門外已等候着一羣有點熟識的面孔，和衣衫襤褸的小孩了。他們的談話的喧鬧聲，使坐在辦公室內的我們感到一陣快慰。</p>
<p>對於繳納五毛錢的保證金，他們有的是遲疑地吝惜着，但經過了一番詳盡的解釋，使他們知道這不過是用來鼓　學生勤學，限制他們隨意缺課而收的，學生只要不缺課到一星期以上的話，到學期結束時，都可以發還，於是他們就釋然地在腰包內掏出五毛錢來，然而在特種情形之下，如家境實在太貧寒時，我們也可以應允給予免收的優待。</p>
<p>六大的報名期限內，我們統計了一下，報名的一共有一百六十多個，但一直到開學一星期後，還有人來報名，不過再來遲的，我們却因功課和學額的關係無法通融。</p>
<p>（二）入學試驗</p>
<p>開學前天的下午二時前，校門外又擠滿了人，這是我們舉行入學試騐的日子。</p>
<p>當我們把報名手續辦理完畢後，就履歷表來了一個比較詳細的統計，結果，不識字的的佔二分之一弱，其他的則程度極不齊，有的僅會寫自已的姓名，有的則有高小程度，至於就年齡而論，十歲以下，的佔全體的百分之七十五，十四歲以下的佔百分之二十四左右，十五歲以上的簡直鳳毛麟角，因之我們須來一個入學試騐以決定班次。</p>
<p>試騐分爲二部分：不識字的只須經過口試，我們的目的是要察看那小孩的年齡是吾適合我們章程上所規定的年齡，言語是吾能領悟，及說得消，因爲據我們過去的經騐，許多精明的學生家長們想要把他底八歲以下的小孩也送到學校裏來榻一點「便宜貨」，他們最大的目的並不在使他的子弟受一點敎育，而只是想把小孩關到學校裹來，要我們替他保管，省得在家裏吵鬧，麻煩，但是我們卻非幼稚園，對於道種小孩，過去因爲他們年齡不足，言語不通，啼哭號叫　，會給予我們不少的困離，所以我們實在不能收容他，家長們經過「求情」不准之後，只有用虛報年齡的方法來「混」進來，到開學後等我們發覺了而請他退學時，家長們也會用「木已成舟」的「旣成事實」來說項，使我們感到有點麻煩和棘手，雖然，終於是請他們退學的，但精明的家長們依舊不放棄他們那「得混　且混過」的宗旨來施其「故技」，因此我們必須用口試這X光來揭破它，不過凡是來報名的學生，除了年齡不足這個條件之外，其餘的都無條件地錄取。</p>
<p>至於識字的就給他們一個筆試，試題只有種，各級都是一律的，但是採取漸進式的問題，塡充法或是選擇法，內容是把國語和常識混合起來的，題目是由淺而深，藉以測騐出學生的程度而編人相當的珊次。</p>
<p>根據考試的成績，我們將這一百多個學生分爲初級，中級，高級三班，初級因人數太多，故更分爲甲乙二組，雖然照這樣初，中，高三級來分時，各級之中的程度難免還有差別，但是我們因爲敎員人數以及暑期中敎室需要修理，粉刷的關係，我們不能　開更多的班次，好在這只不過是短短的六個星期，我們的目的也是給他們一點應有的常識，使新學生能經此六星期的補習而進人下學期的民衆學校，舊學生則能在這暑假中得以補習，及增加一點活的知識，所以這樣的分班，也並沒有多大的關係。</p>
<p>（三）準備工作</p>
<p>關於聘請敎職員方面，在放假前我們已預先接洽好，雖然那只是口頭上的，而且他們也並不十分肯定的答覆。現在，我們需要行正式的發聘書的手續了。我們這民校的組織，是在戰前早已經市敎育局立案的，所以組織方面也依法不能由我們隨意更動。校長則仍是我們的校長，下面是有一位主任，也是由我們的敎師擔任。再下面才是出同學自已擔仟的敎務和訓導之職。因爲我們的組織是如此，所以聘書是由校長蓋章簽發，這樣的確給予我們不少的利便。（一）因爲有些同學的家長恐怕會出什麽亂子，不放心他們的子弟假期內在外面跑。他們結果就因家庭的關係，不能來校授課而謝絕了我們的聘請，但是有了我們這張正式的聘書之後。家長們也就信任他們的子弟了：第二是因爲這張聘書是由校長簽發的，較爲鄭重，所以受聘的同學除了有特別的理由外，多沒有什麽推却，就慨然接受了。吾則我們不知要費多少脣舌，賣多少情面才能得到一個俯諾呢。有了這點理由，聘敎員的工作，很快地就完成了。</p>
<p>今年，有一點値得記叙的，那就是我們六位民衆學校的畢業同學和校友，在我們的勸導和鼓勵之下也來擔任授課。她們都是在工廠裏工作的女工，但竟然能抽出空閒來擔任低級（不識字的一級）的全部課程。這種精神可以證明了我們所推行「卽知即傳人」的小先生制度的成績。</p>
<p>敎職昌的職務和敎務擬定妥善之後，就召集了第一次全體敎職員會議，討論通過所擬定的職務的分配。但在大體上是沒有什麼變動。除此而外，各級的課程及課本，分級諸問題也是在我們的討論程序之內。經過了這次會議後，關於敎師，分級，課本等上課前的問題，大槪都完全辦妥了。</p>
<p>爲要養成學生自治的精神，我們決定仍辦理「糾察隊」和「淸潔隊」，每隊各山隊長一人領導，都是由學生自已所選出，糾察隊的任務是佈岡在各路要衝，在下課時維持秩序。淸潔隊則負責糾正同學的淸潔習慣，扶助小同學淸潔工作。如抹鼻涕，整頓衣襟等。同時我們決定設置淸潔錦標及秩序錦標各一，並在敎室日記中附設課室淸潔悄况和秩序二欄，由各値踝敎師分別加以判定塡寫。每到週末就結算一次，結果則在下週的紀念週時發表。最優良的一級得將該項錦標懸掛在該級敎室之內，若下星期優勝仍屬該級，那末錦標仍可以保留在較室內，吾則須轉移到優勝的另一級，以示獎勵之意</p>
<p>請識字的　去勸吿　不識字的　快來讀書</p>
<p>年齡：八歲以上十四歲以下</p>
<p>資格：識字的及不識字的</p>
<p>學費：不收　保證金：五角（結束時發還）</p>
<p>報名：卽日起七月六日止</p>
<p>校址：膠州路武定路九四〇號</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>暑期中的課程表較平時的容易安排，因爲平時，敎員爲着學校裏的功課及課外作業的關係而致不能抽身，所以使排課程時，限制的條件甚多，每不易得到一張完滿的課程表。在暑假裏　則敎員空閒的時間較多，限制的條件就少，故排起來，自然是省事而討好得多</p>
<p>課程方面，高，中，低三級都以國語，常識，算術三科爲主。此外高級及中低級都有兩小時的唱歌。高級更有一小時的應用文，低，中各級各有遊戲和體育一小時。</p>
<p>校歷規定是七月十日開學上課，但在九日之前，我們就已把一切開學前的準備手續辦妥；將各級學生名單，課程表都公佈；敎員的通知和課程表也都發出，一切就只是等明天開學的來臨。</p>
<p>（四）新生活開始</p>
<p>七月十日下午，時針正指在三點鐘時，門房就把大鐘敲起來。那洪亮的鍊聲便一大羣散在操塲上的學生停止了喧鬧，在校門外的都趕忙走進來，由我們導入了禮堂，舉行這學期第一次聚會的始業式。</p>
<p>坐在禮堂中的雖然有一大部是新來的小朋友，但在唱國歌的時候却是挺整齊的。一百多張小口同時喊出了雄壯的音節，浸浴在這莊嚴的歌聲中，我心裏感到一陣說不出的愉快。恭讀總理遺囑和靜默時，大家都整齊肅穆地立正，鴉雀無聲，這種情形，也是以前所不易見到的。</p>
<p>儀式的開始就是主任的演講。本來在這前面還有校長的演講，但可惜他因事覊絆，臨時不能來參加，吾則我們也可以聆聽別了十多日的校長的訓詞了。主任所講的大概是說明求學的目的，並鼓勵學生用功上進，以及闡述本校推行「卽知卽傳人」的小先生制。繼之是敎務主任及訓導主任報告校務並上下課應汪意的規的後，儀式就完畢。接着分級由導師領入敎室，進行導師訓話及發給新書等事項。第一天的工作就到這裏爲止。</p>
<p>那天晚上，我興奮得失眠起來，腦子裏儘是盤旋着校舍的影子，小朋友的喧鬧聲，以及明天，後天，大後天……的工作……</p>
<p>（五）課外活動</p>
<p>剛開學的幾天，下課後的秩序是難免有點紊亂，三天後，我們已可以在校內各處發現我們的「小警察」了。他們雄糾糾地站在自己的崗位上，臂間纏着「糾察員」三字的白布。精神抖擻，活潑潑地執行職務，那糾察長則到處巡邏視察。</p>
<p>糾察員是各級選出的，而且只有十二個名額，於是許，未被選的學生，一下課就大家蜂擁到辦公室裹來，要求參加糾察員服務，爲了名額有限，我們雖已儘景擴充，改變辦法，使每天都有一批新的糾察員輪流服務；但結果仍不能使共他十分之八的小朋友滿足他們的慾望，所以辦公室每天都有他們來麻煩，直到一星期過後方才稍息。這些固然是使我們麻煩的事，但這種熱烈的精神却給我們內心莫大的欣慰。</p>
<p>經過一星期的考察，道批「小警察」都極忠實地執行他們的職務。扶梯上，沙濾水缸旁已經沒有紛擾，搶先，喧鬧等悄形。同時表現得最有精神的是在三點鐘前，校門未開的十分鐘間，糾察員早已把同學的隊伍依班次高矮，整齊地排列好。一排排鴉雀無聲地等候着預備鐘一敲，他們就魚貫走人校門。這種動作私毫沒有敎員亦旁指導或監　，這在門外的行人看來，也許首先就給他一個深刻的印象罷。</p>
<p>每週除了紀念週及低中級的游戲外，有一個鐘頭是學生們自己的時問，那就是週會。在這一點鐘裏是他們練習演講的機會，每一個人當輪値到他演講時，都熱烈地把握住這機會，絕不輕易放過。雖然因爲程度的關係，他們只能講些故事。但有好些故事曾使我深深的感動，從他們的言論中，我可以看出他們有着蓬勃的朝氣，以及堅定正確的信念。這使我堅信着我們一定能够漸漸接進光明的前途呢。</p>
<p>爲了要更加提高他們的演講的興趣，校方更舉行了一次全校演講比賽，各級推選代表參加，成績當然是比平時的週會來得精彩，除此之外，還有淸潔及秩序比賽，習字比賽，這些優勝者都得到了應得的獎勵，因此在本校內，大家都養成一種前進的，競爭向上的精神　無論在學業上及課外活動方面都是。</p>
<p>（六）敎職員會議</p>
<p>這一個下午的確是令人懐戀，回味的，那就是八月四日的下午的敎職員會議，我們感覺到上學期敎職員間太沒有聯絡，上課時大家准辦公室裏拿了根粉筆去上課，下課了，大家丢下點名簿，拍一拍粉筆灰就回身走了，敎員見面的機會少，自然談不到感情，所以有時有的敎員因受了學生的刺激或是別種原因而灰心，因而辭職等，爲了彌補這個缺憾，全體敎職員會議的召集確是刻不容緩了。</p>
<p>這個下午始終是在緊張熱烈與融和欣悅交織中渡過，三時一敲，大家就圍了那八張實騐棹排成的長棹坐下，主席起立說明今天開會的目的，十分鐘之後，我們就開始照着預定的順序討論，第一件就是敎員缺課的問題，在暑期內這種現象雖然很少，但上學期牠郤給我們極大的困難，或在下學期仍將會繼續來麻煩我們呢！所以它就成了討論的問題之一，根據大家的意見，認爲可以分爲二個原因，一是敎員未認淸「義務」與「責任」的分別，許多人以爲敎民衆學校是種「不受報酬」的義務，所以隨便缺上了幾課是毫無關係的，反正學校又沒有權來干涉，否則就索性以辭職來對校方作要挾，因此我們目前第一要務是辦理敎職員進修會，以討論民衆敎育問題，敎學經騐與心得的交換爲目的，使有個敎員對民衆敎育均有正確的認識，第二個原因是像前面所提的敎員間沒有聯絡，沒有　厚的感情，或則敎員有時受學生刺激及其他原因如上課則搭起先生架子，下課不屑與學生接近，使師生間沒有情感可言，因此而灰心，而感到對民敎沒有興趣，補救方法是經常召開針職員會議，一方面聯絡感情，藉以互相勉勵和督促，另方面是共同硏討敎務，使整個學校的校務分担到每一個人的肩上，學校的成績好壊都由全體敎職員來負責。</p>
<p>第　件是學生的缺課問題：在開學時學生往往是濟濟一堂，然而到放假時課室內就寥寥無幾，這也是上學期所感覺到的一件嚴重的問題，我們的結論是這樣：由於學校本身的原因是：（一）敎員缺課，給予學生以不良印象，這在前面已提過，（二）是上課時間與工廠工作時間衝突，改進辦法是籌備恢復工人夜班。至於學生方面的原因是：（一）學生沒有恒心，（二）是家長的留難，其中有許多是由於封建觀念作怪，以爲讓「小姑娘」拋頭露面地到處奔跑，和男孩子厮混在一起是不妥當而加以橈阻，（三）是經濟問題，學生因家庭經濟困灘，物價日益高漲，自不能不放棄讀書而去工作來幫助家用，同時上述的本校上課時間也有極大關係，改淮的辦法是加緊家庭　問以帮助他們解決困難，鼓動沒有恒心的學生。</p>
<p>第三件是討論下學期本校校務的進行，並選舉負責人員，結果選舉五人組織招生委員會，辦理開學前的切手續，以移交至下學期的負責人。</p>
<p>討論時大家爭先恐後地發言，情况之熱烈是以前所有的討論會中所僅見，到討論順序上的一項快完畢時，大家摸摸肚皮，對着棹上的大瓶羅宋汽水眼睜睜地疑心着是吾能喝得下，但這時忽有人提議到操塲上舉行次籃球混戰之後方才再趁渴來解決這些碩大的汽水，無疑地，大家就一呼百和，馬上丢掉了外衣，四人一組的組成三組，實行車輪戰，連那幾位平素從不參加運動的同學這時都喜孜孜地去追逐那籃球，駝背凸肚，長短肥瘦，互相輝映，「美妙」的姿勢層出不窮，笑括自不免相繼而生，但大家都忘其所以，英勇堅決地沉着作戰，目到大家筋疲力竭，週身浴在汗水之中才停下來，這時時針已指在六時上，吃了汽水之後，大家拖了疲乏的身子和興奮愉快的心情踏上歸途</p>
<p>（七）休業式</p>
<p>個學期之中，往往是學期開始和學期結束時比較忙一點，而且忙的是手而不是口，反之，在學期進行中則較空閒，那時忙的是口而不是手，因爲開學時須辦理報名手續，批閱人學試騐卷子等。而學期結束時則忙着改學期考試卷及塡發成績報吿單，發還保證金，新舊生報名等工作，現在學期父將結束，—八月十九日—報吿單，發還保證余，舊生報名，學期考試這神種都馬上等待着我們進行，不過今年因我們對於導師的權限與責任加重，以符合「敎職員全體共同負祖校務」的原則，所以各級各科學生學業及品行放績都歸由導師負責向各敎員收集，結算妥當後方才交到敎務處來，敎務處只負塡發報吿單的責任，工作比較是輕鬆得多了。</p>
<p>我們預定在十九日下午舉行一個休業式來結束道個暑期，那天是星期一，因此有星期日的一整天充分時間來給我們辦理各種準備工作辦理獎品，預備發保證金，塡報吿單。</p>
<p>六星期前始業式的一切情景到現在仍在我腦海中極淸晰地顯現着，而今天休業式正跟牠極相似，我們仍在那狹小的實騐室，膳堂兼的禮堂內舉行，只不過講台上堆滿了一大堆的獎品，百多個小朋友眼睜睜，興高采烈地張望着，然而他們所急切需要知道的謎—到底誰能獲得—一直要挨到最後的十五分鐘，等陳主任演講完畢，敎務處和訓導處的校務報吿後方才褐曉，這些獎品計共分爲：「學字獎」，「工字獎」，「勤字獎」以及品學兼優的「行字獎」等四種，凡是服務糾察隊及淸潔隊成績優良的都得「工字獎」；學期學業成績中均名列全級第三名以上的得「學字獎」；一學期從不缺課遲到的得「勤字獎」；品行學業成績都在甲等以上的則給予「行字獎」，當他們懐了興奮喜悅的心情接受了獎品之後，休業式就完畢，接着是各級回到本敎室發給成績報單及保證金，但如各學級生下學期繼續來校的只需換取一張新的收據，保證金發還的手續就可以省掉，其中有百分之七十以上是不願收回保證金，也就是說有百分之七十以上的學生下學期仍將來校求學，這眞够使我們與奮。</p>
<p>最後，我們並率領全體小朋友趕到工部局女中，參加四時半開始的「麥倫，修德小學，聖瑪利亞，工部局女中，昌平路小學五校義校聯合演講比賽大會」作爲本學期的一個最有意義的結束。</p>
<p>（八）一個有意義的結束</p>
<p>「二十世紀是兒童的世紀！」</p>
<p>「我們要做新中國的兒童！」</p>
<p>「我們要使義務寧校永存！」</p>
<p>一走進了工部局女中的　門口，我們就可以看見那莊嚴的大禮堂內貼滿了這些標語，　然地有許多是出於小朋友的手筆，其他期出於小先生的手。再進入了拱形的禮堂門，更可以發現到台上也張貼了標語。但主要的郤是兩張圖畫，一張寫着：「小朋友！靜聽！」下面書了許多小孩靜聽的姿勢；另一張是寫「小朋及！坐看！」下面書的是坐的姿勢。更有興味的是貼在左面牆壁上的「民衆敎育的功用」：圖中最左上角是一個被布蒙了眼睛的文盲，由一個箭號導入了民衆學校，再淮大了敎室聽講後，就由末一個箭號導入最右下角，那文盲已成了有兩撇小鬍子的小先生，在像煞有介事地敎導別人了。這幅圖書相當吸引人注意。總之這會塲裹充滿着一種活潑，愉快，淸新的空氣。</p>
<p>規定是在叫時半就開始的，但因有二校路途較遠而學半年齡又太小，故等他們趕到後方召集所有參加大會的來賓，小先生，小朋友拍了一個團體照之後，時間已是五時半了。主席是一位女同學，他一上台，簡單快捷地報吿了今天演講的題材—高級注重思想理論方面，中級注重道德方面，低級注重公民常識方面，以及參加的學校，各組與賽者姓名人數之後，就先請×女士演講。她對本會的感想是：在本地的小朋友能在這樣安定，莊嚴的環境中舉行演講比賽，這在內地常遭空襲的小朋友看來，那簡直是一件非常幸福的事，因此希望各位小朋友能利用這優越的環境多多學習，結束了這演講的是一陣熟烈的鼓掌聲。</p>
<p>接着就開始了低級的比賽，最先登台的是一位八九歲的女孩，口齒極爲伶俐，講的是一個小孩因他誠心正意堅定不移的結果，使她母親兇險的病獲醫而愈的故事，她那雍容老練，從容不迫的姿態，眞使人不信是一個　校最低級生。</p>
<p>低級及中高各級各組都是每校推派代表一人參加，故每組計共有五人，每組講畢，卽由四位評判馬上報吿結果，在評判員每次結算分數時，就由各校小朋友擔仟輪流表演，他們所演出的都是合唱他們最擅長熟練的歌曲，當這幾百張小嘴同聲地爆發出宏亮整齊的歌曲時，席間的來賓都深深地受着這雄壯的歌聲所感動了。</p>
<p>趁着休息的時間，我得了一個對各校小朋友作較爲仔細的觀察和比較的機會，在五校之中，學生人數以修德及麥倫爲最多，都在一百二十人以上，其中以昌平路小學的小朋友最爲有趣，他們都是淸一色的江北拾荒的小朋友，身上穿着一律的藍布衫褲，赤足，禿頭，在演講時也脫離不了本鄉的士音，他們的舉動也較之別校的小朋友爲活潑。</p>
<p>高級的幾位講員的題材都是關於理論及時　方央的。從他們簡單的確演詞中，我們可以得到一個鼓勵，使們們感覺到光明的前途是決在不遠。尤其是最後一位所講的「民眾敎育的意義」眞使們們佩服。</p>
<p>當評判員報吿了最後一組—高級組—講員的名次，並發給了獎品之後，主席高興地摸摸出淸了的檯子宣布散會時，四週工廠的汽笛聲已吿訴我們是七點鐘了。</p>
<p>帶了留戀，惆悵而又興奮的心情踏出大門後，我却依依不捨地望着那一班活潑，跳躍着的背影，暗暗地祝福他們。</p>
<p>（九）尾聲</p>
<p>學期是已經結束了，我們正在辦理招新生的工作，以及整理校具，預備移交。然而那羣活躍活跳的背影仍在我腦海中盤旋着，耳邊還好像聽見他們在喊：「郭先生！明朝會！」，「……」。我覺得這暑期中，不論我對他們或他們與我的感情都極為熱烈融洽。我已經不記得及去注意什麼時候開始，也不知道誰去敎他們，當他們在暮色蒼茫中挾着小書包回家時，假如看見我，總會喊：「明朝會。」在下課有空時，他們也常拖着我底衣襟，要求跟他們一起遊玩，甚至有許多不曾上过我的课，而我也不知道他们底名字，但他们卻也这样親爭地對付我，不過這也並不限於對某一位敎員，只要他是一們平時不茍且，不常缺課，而常跟他們接觸的敎員，總能得到同樣的待遇，有時，我感覺到有些話在我們嘴裹跟他們說時，他們都極樂於聽從，反之，有時同樣的話在他們父母嘴裹說出時，却當作耳邊風。這大概是由於尊重他們的自由，有賞有罰的集團生活的結果罷。總之，我想他們所以如此，是因家庭未能滿足他們的緣故。他們底父母或因日夜工作，和他們缺少接觸機會，或因沒有智識。酗酒，賭博，仟意毆打咒駡；以　骨肉間沒有感情可言。小朋友們就只有將他們的愛寄託在敎師身上了，所以我感覺到在這樣結成的一個集團中生活學習和指導他們，總不會使一個敎員感到什麼極大的灰心，失望而說：「我決不願再敎民眾學校，我再不願看見他們了！」罷。</p>
<p>我只願永遠在這充滿着天眞坦白和愛的融和的集團中生活，我要跟他們學習，同時指導他們，這是我唯一的願望。</p>

<h3>迎國慶</h3>
<p>— 若霖</p>
<p>一齊揮戈，劃個十字，再劃個十字，我們神聖地踏着先烈們底熱血邁進！</p>
<p>歷史課與我們的眞太偉大了啊。「光祖宗之玄靈，振大漢之先聲」，當第廿九個國慶紀念節到來的時候，應該如何緬思追懐，激昂奮發喲。</p>
<p>且回憶過去罷：一八四〇年後，我們陷入於半殖民地的地位；封建的滿洲政府也曾一度想發憤圖强，草草地要把軍用工業建立起來，然而因爲沒有一般的工業經濟基礎，終於很慘淡地失敗了，同様，爲了封建政治機構的不善，民衆不僅受到外來的壓迫，抑目遭着內在的苦榨，幾度起來反抗着，滿洲政府恐懼他們偉大的勢力，不惜用最殘忍的手段來高壓，在「寗贈友邦，母與家奴」的口號下，倒行逆施着；對外是屈服，而本身更荒淫與無恥</p>
<p>大衆再也不能忍耐了。同時，革命領袖孫中山先生們敏感地覺到非推翻滿淸皇室，以改變政治機構，不足以挽救垂亡的中國，他們便武裝了民衆，受着極大的犧牲，發動辛亥革命，終於把對建政府打倒了，造成了新中華。</p>
<p>這給予外來者一個新的認識。另外，他們需要改變方式，剛柔兼顧。辛亥革命因爲先天的關係，部份封建殘餘還未肅淸，後來袁世凱叛變了，作爲鎭壓革命的工具，道樣就阻礙了二次革命的成功。但袁氏稱帝後就翹了辮子。接着張大辮子蛆虫之復活也不過是迥光返照，莫不薰歇燼滅。但不久軍閥的混戰—皖直奉直蘇浙等戰爭終使中國不統一，糾纏於內戰，大盡「被」宰割之能事。由「五四」到「五卅」的歷程是痛苦艱難的，然而北伐的大革命結果奠定了中華民族統一的基礎。不論如何用大砲轟炸，用經濟束縛，或巧篡豪奪，或挑撥離間，中華民族終一逕地向民族解放的大道邁進。</p>
<p>目前正在更大的民族革命過程中。在歷史上是太偉大了。</p>
<p>中華民族在世界的黑暗中，透出極度的光亮，她耍充實歷史的一頁。現在決不是歐洲中古世紀的重現，（雖然有些人在過份担心着。）歷史決不倒退。中國要無愧地領導着世界作正義的奮鬥。得道者必多助，但也爲了目助，大家起來罷。重開滇緬路正爲了挽救世界的滅亡。</p>
<p>在此時此地，當茲偉大的節日來臨，大家請切身檢討一下。一部份立直了做夢的荒淫無恥者就要被巨槌打下了。齗齗於一己的私利，置整個民族於不顧，無論大蛆虫和小黴菌（例如團米及其他投機者）一律在光明的到來前消滅。</p>

<h3>怎樣治療「煩悶病」</h3>
<p>— 乃敏</p>
<p>時至今日，「煩悶」已成了孤島上的「流行症」。它把陰影普遍地投射在每個人的心頭。它是人們精神上的枷鎖，緊緊地把人們的心靈束縛在狹小的思想圈裏，使活潑的人們變成了遲鈍，使胸懐壯志的英雄减緩了前進的步伐，使樂觀者變成「憂天主義」的俘虜。</p>
<p>於是惡果就產生了，輕則形成了一般人公有的「萎靡氣」，重則造成了孤島上盛行着的「自殺在」，同樣是消極地向着墳墓走，只是前者較爲慢性，後者較爲急性而已。</p>
<p>然而「兵來將擋，水來土掩。」任伺暴疾急症，只要處置得宜，未始沒有救藥。古今中外有識之士治療「煩悶病」的方法雖各有巧妙不同，而其根本則如出一軌，那就是工作。由工作得來的煩悶，固然不難用工作去治療，就是從「事業上」或「情塲上」得來的痛苦，赤未始不可以工作來解除，因爲那時你已找到了一條更高尙更神聖的路徑，過去的微細的得失當然是無關痛癢的了。</p>
<p>名聞全球的大發明家愛迪生曾設：「講到治療煩悶的方法，工作比威士忌酒更有效。」</p>
<p>托爾斯泰曾說：「人們的幸福包藏在生活中而生活就是工作。」</p>
<p>加里爾（Calyle），英國名小說家，也曾說過「工作是最好的治療法，它能翳治人們頭上的任何痛苦和不幸。」</p>
<p>陷在苦悶中的朋友們，不要再徘徊在煩惱的氛圍中吧！趕快振作精神，担起工作來吧！只有工作才能把你從煩悶！救出，只有工作才能使你變成一個更堅實更高尙的自己。</p>

<p>余甘棠彷彿觸了電，突然抬起頭來，把驚異的目光瞧着霍桑。「什麼？他借給我的是空手槍？沒有子彈的空手槍？——霍先生，當眞嗎？你怎麽知道？」他的語聲中滿含着懐疑的調子。霍桑緩緩地點着頭，答道：……是的。眞的，不過你還不知道。你的朋友宋兆麒已完全吿訴我。他眞有急智，說的話也實在。那枝手槍，剛才我在警廳裏已經瞧過，那槍膛的確完全是空的。不過你當時一心要想去找趙伯雄爲難，你整個的身體，已被瘋在的感情所支配，拿着槍就走，目然想不到把槍膛察看一下。」余甘棠作醒悟狀道：「原來如此！我眞想不到兆麒會弄這個乖巧。他眞是個——」</p>

<h3>Australia and India Express Support for Reopening the Burma Road, Believing That Britain Is Beginning to Strengthen Its Far Eastern Policy and Abandoning Its Policy of Appeasement Toward Japan</h3>
<p>Melbourne. Today, Australian Foreign Minister McEwen declared that Australia fully supports the decision to reopen the Burma Road. Australia had previously expressed its views to Britain. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Calcutta. The Chairman of the All-India Congress Committee, Acharya, said here today that all Indians welcome the news that the Burma Road will be reopened. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. According to news reports, the British government had requested the Chinese government to send a task force to protect Burma if Burma felt threatened by Japan as a result of the reopening of the road. When this matter was inquired about by officials here, the response was that they were unaware of such a request. Officials welcomed the British Prime Minister's statement on reopening the Burma Road, not only because of the material benefits that would result from using the road, which would undoubtedly contribute to China's war of resistance, but also because this matter could symbolize Britain's determination to end its appeasement of Japan and join a common front with the United States in the Far East. It is generally believed here that the dangerous phase of the European and Chinese wars has passed. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Chinese National Movement and International Phenomena</h3>
<p>The international situation encountered on the Double Tenth Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China is such that everyone inevitably understands the profound significance within it. The Xinhai Revolution was the beginning of the Chinese national movement, and now is the final stage of the completion of the tempering of the national movement. The international situation it faces is precisely the largest tempering furnace.</p>
<p>Because of the collusion between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the international situation has made the Far Eastern atmosphere surrounding China and Japan unable to continue its chaos. It has made the haze of the international situation clear, the boundaries clear, and the facts have proven that China's war of resistance has won widespread support. Looking back from today to those years when the Far Eastern dispute had just begun, it was just a spark. Although its background was not without some more serious problems, those who started the fire at that time never expected it to develop to such a scale, even indirectly leading to the tragic disaster of a world war. Now, the world significance of China's war of resistance is clear due to the recent developments in the Far East. The various prejudices or biases of the international community in the past, as well as the various tangible and intangible measures that harmed China, can now be corrected in a timely and thorough manner. Fundamentally, the essence of the Chinese national movement and its relationship to the safety and security of the Far Eastern situation should also be deeply understood by all parties, and close cooperation with China should be carried out in order to take full and effective measures against the growing crisis in the Pacific.</p>
<p>From the Xinhai year to the present, these nearly thirty years are the process of building the Republic of China. The war that has been going on for the past three years is the most difficult and final scene in the nation-building process. Everything that has happened in the war has been enough to prove that the new China has begun to step into the ranks of modern powers. This is the result of the sacrifices and struggles of the military and civilians in recent years, and also the effectiveness shown by the long-term national movement from the Xinhai Revolution to the present. The remarkable results have been achieved, and the Chinese themselves must not be self-deprecating. The international perception of China should also be placed on a new level and reconsidered. We must inevitably have a positive influence on the Far East and even the entire world. It should be known that the turmoil of the Far Eastern situation has been going on for decades. The main reason is naturally that a stable balance cannot be formed between the countries involved, and the crux of the problem is the lack of a strong China. The ultimate goal of the Chinese national movement is to make up for this major deficiency. On the other hand, this is why those who invade China want to destroy it so much. In recent years, China has been at the final stage of its efforts. The restoration of future Far Eastern peace and order is only possible after China stands tall in the Asian continent in an independent and free posture. Not only that, the more serious the Pacific crisis, the more urgent this need becomes. The recent special concerns of the democratic powers about the Far East and their consideration of various emergency measures prove that a new era is about to unfold in the Pacific. One of the most important tasks is how to further integrate these measures with the existing effective factors in the Far East. China's national independence movement should also strive to complete the final task in this expanded international crisis. Looking at the international situation in recent years, some countries, large and small, strong and weak, have become vassals or even disappeared, and the colors of some regions have changed on the map. Only China, regardless of whether the international environment is beneficial or harmful, and whether friendly countries support it, has always persevered arduously, unyieldingly, and defended the country with its own strength, moving towards its predetermined goal. In addition to demonstrating the true value of the Chinese national movement, it has also fully fulfilled its important responsibility of maintaining justice and order in the Far East. This is a fact that should be recognized by the world today.</p>
<p>Recently, the reckless actions of the aggressors have been so extreme that they can hardly be imagined or controlled by normal reason. But this is by no means a sign that the world crisis is becoming darker and more chaotic. On the contrary, it is precisely the process that must be gone through in order to set things right. Observing the recent developments, the factors of light are increasing in direct proportion to the darkness. In any case, justice and fairness are virtues inherent in everyone's nature, while aggression is only for the sake of fulfilling the greed of a few. In the long-term torment and tempering, all the weaknesses of will and even habits will be gradually eliminated. In the end, of course, only the innate virtues will remain. China's three years of arduous war have already proven that this statement is not false. In the war pattern of the world, it will inevitably tend in this direction. The deeper the night, the closer the dawn. Whether it is the future of the Chinese national movement, the Far East, or the world, a glimmer of dawn has already been revealed in the deep dark night.</p>
<h3>Thai Aircraft Repeatedly Fly Over Vietnamese Territory: Thai-Vietnamese Relations Worsen: France States That It Will Ignore Thailand's Demands: Thai University Students Hold Demonstrations</h3>
<p>Hanoi. French officials here announced last night that they had received instructions from the Vichy government to "ignore" the threatening demands made by Thailand to France. At the same time, officials here again denied that conflicts had occurred between the two sides on the Thai-Vietnamese border, and denied reports that Thai troops had crossed the Vietnamese border. French officials also stated that the negotiations between Thailand and France are currently being handled entirely by Vichy and Bangkok. At the same time, the retirement of five French military officers in Vietnam has caused some unease here. (Associated Press dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Bangkok. Three thousand Thai university students gathered yesterday in front of the Ministry of National Defense to demand a revision of the border with Vietnam. When Thai Prime Minister Songgram General delivered a speech to the students, the demonstrators cheered enthusiastically. Songgram declared that Thailand's demands were only for Thai territory and areas inhabited by Thai people. The students then held another demonstration march in the afternoon, which was unprecedented in Thai history. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Bangkok. In view of the tense relations between Vietnam and Thailand, the Thai Prime Minister has taken precautionary measures. The Ministry of the Interior has begun to investigate the activities of the French in Thailand and has broadcast reports that the Thai people should no longer accept Vietnamese currency in order to avoid future losses. The government has also issued a proclamation recruiting 500 volunteer air force soldiers, aged seventeen to twenty. Newspapers here prominently reported that the French government had rejected Thailand's demands for the cession of territory, and some advocated taking swift action. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Hanoi. Authoritative French sources claim that Thailand has agreed in principle to the establishment of a joint commission by France and Thailand to resolve minor incidents between the two countries and to leave Thailand's territorial demands to Vichy for resolution. (Associated Press dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Vichy. Recently, Thai aircraft have repeatedly flown over the airspace of French Indochina, causing considerable tension in relations. Yesterday, a Vietnamese Laotian named Nai Xiangtai (transliteration) was shot and killed by Vietnamese military police on the Mekong River. The Thai government insisted that the deceased was a Thai citizen, further worsening the situation. According to reliable sources here, the man was actually trying to swim across the Mekong River and was shot by the French military police. Furthermore, an investigation revealed that the deceased was actually a Laotian native belonging to Vietnam. The Thai government, wanting to attract international attention, claimed that the man was a Thai citizen and notified its embassies abroad of the incident. However, it is generally believed here that the incident was actually initiated by the Thai government, its intention being the same as the previous intrusion of Thai aircraft into Vietnamese airspace. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Vichy. Regarding the recent border disputes between French Indochina and Thailand, well-informed sources here recently stated that France signed a non-aggression pact with Thailand in early June of this year. However, this pact has not yet been ratified. At the same time, the French Minister to Thailand, Lepissier, and Thai Prime Minister Pibul also exchanged documents on resolving various border issues. The border line between Thailand and Vietnam, dating back to 1907, has not been clearly demarcated, especially in the Mekong River basin. Thailand has certain rights on the left bank of the river, while the right bank is entirely controlled by France. Therefore, disputes often arise over the sovereignty of countless small islands in the Mekong River. On June 12 of this year, the French Minister to Thailand and the Thai Prime Minister exchanged documents with the aim of resolving this difficulty. At that time, the Thai government solemnly declared that once the Mekong River border issue was resolved, the Thai government would no longer make any territorial claims. Unexpectedly, while Japan and Vietnam were conducting negotiations, Thailand suddenly notified the French government that the French-Thai non-aggression pact could not be approved until a mixed commission was established to carry out Thai-Vietnamese border demarcation. In September, Thailand took a further step and made other territorial demands, stating in essence that if the sovereignty of Vietnam was transferred to another country, France would cede Laos and Cambodia to Thailand. In addition, it demanded that Vietnam cede several places belonging to French sovereignty on the Mekong River, some near the Thai border and others in Laos. The French government has rejected all of the above demands. (Havas News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<h3>Large Numbers of German Troops Continuously Enter Romanian Territory Along the Danube River, with Intentions to Invade Iraqi Oil Fields; German Troops in Poland Increased to 100 Divisions</h3>
<p>Bucharest. The first batch of German troops is currently moving down the Danube River, carrying tanks, flat-trajectory guns, anti-aircraft guns, and air squadrons. After arriving at Giurgiu, the German troops will advance to Ploiesti and Bucharest, as well as Targoviste near Bucharest. German troops will build an air force base there. Anti-aircraft guns will be erected at the oil fields and the Giurgiu oil pipeline terminal. In recent weeks, German war materiel has been continuously transported into Romanian territory in unprecedented quantities and of enormous value. As a result, the trade between Romania and Germany, which was previously in Romania's favor, has now become in Germany's favor. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>London. Reuters foreign correspondents claim that it is impossible to ascertain the number of German troops entering Romanian territory, their intentions, or where they will be stationed due to propaganda and Romanian censorship of communications. Personnel dispatched by the German Secret Police have been operating in Romania for some time, arranging how German troops will enter the territory. This is a noteworthy issue. Hungary may have followed in the footsteps of Sweden and Finland by allowing Germany to pass through. Romania's actions in inviting German troops are certainly contrary to neutrality. According to reports, when Germany used troops in Poland last year, it assembled a large army in the area of the railway leading from Poland to Romania. However, because the Soviet army advanced rapidly and occupied Poland first, the Soviet Union occupied the area and re-laid the tracks to the same gauge as the Soviet railways. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>London. British sources received news last night that Germany had recently greatly reinforced its troops in Poland. It is generally believed that this move is an attempt to exert pressure on the Soviet Union. Another British source believes that the number of German troops in Poland has now reached 100 divisions. It is speculated that Germany's increase in troops in Poland is intended to force the Soviet Union to take a "friendly" reaction if Germany takes action in the Black Sea and the Tartar Strait in the future. (Associated Press dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Stockholm. The "Tidningen" recently published an unconfirmed Berlin report stating that German and Italian troops would soon break through Romania and Turkey to reach Iraq in order to seize British oil fields. (Associated Press dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>German Military Action Against Romania Is Composed of Two Factors</p>
<p>London. According to Reuters military correspondent Colonel Lowe, the military situation in Romania today is composed of several factors. Its geographical location, agricultural fields, and natural resources, allowing it to be rich in oil, have made Romania a military target for both East and West. Therefore, aggression from the West is not surprising. The Germans will mobilize at least two of their famous mixed corps to occupy Romania. Although the Romanian army is equipped with slightly older equipment, its officers and soldiers number a total of 1.6 million. The Axis powers dispatched elite German troops as the vanguard after the Brenner Pass meeting, undoubtedly for this reason. The German mixed corps is organized as follows: (1) Reconnaissance troops composed of motorcycle machine gun squads and light armored vehicle infantry squads. (2) A tank group composed of 540 tanks, which was quite successful in northern France. (3) A brigade of riflemen riding motorcycles, consisting of five battalions and motorcycles, and vehicles equipped with infantry guns, anti-aircraft guns, and flat-trajectory guns. (4) An artillery regiment and 100 five-inch howitzers. Hitler used the strength of this army to cause France to collapse and greatly wished to display it on the British coast. However, it was a pity that it did not achieve its wish and was disbanded. Therefore, the problem of continuing to maintain and train it arose. Thus, entering Romania now is killing two birds with one stone. In addition, there is another factor, namely, the number of German aircraft may exceed that of Britain. However, most of the strength of the German air force lies in the mixed corps of ground troops aided by dive bombers. However, when it encounters Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft in Britain, it falls one after another, like falling leaves in late autumn. At this time, when the final battle of the Axis powers is still far away, these dive bombers and mechanized divisions cannot be allowed to be idle. Judging from the entire military action of the Axis powers, it can be seen that they have changed their previous military plans after discovering a serious miscalculation of their strength against Britain. The German General Command's change of its scheduled plan at this time is tantamount to admitting failure, because the situation today is very different from that in June. The British army is becoming stronger and stronger, and its air force has also expanded considerably during this period. Powerful bombers and long-range fighters will soon be dispatched to attack German and Italian positions anywhere. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>The Axis Powers Exert New Pressure: Romanian Leaders to Visit Berlin</p>
<p>Budapest. Although the Bucharest side has strongly denied the entry of German troops into Romania, well-informed sources revealed today that the summons of King Michael of Romania and General Antonescu to the German and Italian capitals will be followed by new pressure from the Axis powers. According to reports, King Michael and General Antonescu will travel to Berlin and then to Rome at the end of this month to meet with Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss the details of resolving the new order in the Balkans. At the same time, diplomatic circles here have learned that Germany has assured the Soviet government that the entry of German troops into Romania will not change the status quo in the Balkans. According to diplomatic sources, the German government's only wish is to prevent the possibility of Britain landing in Romania's Black Sea ports and seizing Romania's oil wells, which are of great importance to Germany's war machine. (International News Agency dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>The Situation in Romania Deteriorates Daily: British Nationals in Romania Ordered to Evacuate</p>
<p>Bucharest. The British Ambassador to Romania, Hoare, has advised all British nationals involved in the Romanian oil industry to leave the country immediately. All those who have been advised have now moved out of the oil area. Six of the twelve British nationals residing in Bucharest left the country today, and the rest will leave Romania on Monday next week. Ambassador Hoare requested Romania to explain the situation arising from the entry of German troops into Romanian territory. Subsequently, after receiving a reply from the Romanian side, he issued the advice for British nationals to leave the country. It is reported that the Romanian side is currently making rapid preparations to accommodate German troops entering the country by rail and sailing down the Danube River by ship. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Bucharest. Sir Reginald Hoare, the British Minister to Romania, has requested the Romanian government to immediately explain the situation arising from Germany's clear intention to station regular troops in important locations in Romanian territory. The earliest date for the arrival of German troops in Romanian territory is expected to be Thursday. British officials here are well aware that if German troops are stationed in Romanian territory, the British may not be able to maintain their mission in Bucharest. Therefore, Britain's position in Romania depends on the response of Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<h3>Britain and Turkey in Close Contact; Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Resigns</h3>
<p>London. Undersecretary Butler declared in the House of Commons today that the British government is in close contact with the Turkish government to discuss matters of mutual concern. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Istanbul. The Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union departed for Moscow yesterday to resume his duties. He returned to Ankara at the beginning of September to report on his work. At the same time, German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen has returned here after a three-week vacation. (Reuters dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<h3>New Group Formed in the Balkans: Rome Denies Statement</h3>
<p>Rome. Regarding the report in the London "News Chronicle" that Germany and Italy intend to organize a new Balkan consultation including Bulgaria, Albania, Yugoslavia, and Greece, but excluding Turkey, authoritative sources here solemnly denied it yesterday, stating that it was inaccurate.

<h3>Spanish Cabinet Reportedly to Be Reorganized: German and Italian Special Envoys Welcomed by Spanish Newspapers</h3>
<p>Madrid. Political figures here stated that after Spanish Interior Minister Suner's visit to Berlin and Rome, there will inevitably be significant results in Spain's domestic politics. A five-person meeting is scheduled to be held this week to review the general political situation and the contents of Suner's meetings with Hitler and Mussolini. It is generally believed that the Spanish cabinet may soon be reorganized. (Haitong dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid. Regarding the report that Italian special envoy General Bono and German Nazi Party special envoy Himmler will soon visit Madrid, the government newspaper "Arriba" commented that Spain's politics are now once again in contact with the European continent, and Spain will occupy its due position in the new European order. The newspaper also called the two special envoys the most senior and reputable liaison officers of Mussolini and Hitler, and political leaders for the construction of the "New European Order."

<h3>Churchill Addresses the House of Commons on the War Situation: British Naval, Land, and Air Defenses Greatly Strengthened; Enemy's Blitzkrieg Plan Becomes a Mirage</h3>
<p>London - British Prime Minister Churchill addressed the House of Commons today on the war situation, stating that Hitler had unleashed his poisonous wrath upon our civilians and cities for over a month. He claimed he would raze British cities to the ground. The first question we should ask is, to what extent has the full strength of the German bombers been deployed? The German short-range dive bombers, numbering several hundred, have not been seen since suffering a major blow on August 15th. They are likely being kept in reserve for the overall plan to invade England, or have been moved to other battlefields; this is unknown. Therefore, we only have to deal with long-range heavy bombers. On average, about 400 military bombers seem to fly to our coast every night. Whether this number can be greatly increased is doubtful. What is certain is that German aircraft can sometimes exert their full force for several consecutive days. However, on a monthly basis, the average number may not increase significantly. The number of enemy aircraft attacks has gradually decreased in the past ten days. In the month since the major air raids began, British casualties and material damage have gradually decreased. Most of the German bomber pilots can only drop bombs indiscriminately. Generally speaking, the German effort to attack England has absorbed a portion of its total strength. I do not wish to say that we have fully measured the enemy's strength, but we are certainly more confident of the enemy's strength than before. The Germans claim to have dropped a total of 22,000 tons of explosives on England since the start of the war and claim to have treated London with 251 tons of explosives on Thursday night. Upon investigation, 180 people died in London that night. According to this calculation, one ton of bombs cannot kill one person. Compared to the dangers of the attacks from 1914 to 1918, it is only one-thirteenth as dangerous. At the beginning of the engagement, we expected to die two or three thousand people and injure twelve thousand every night. However, from the start of the war to last Saturday, a total of 8,500 people died from bombing and 13,000 were injured. Since the major air raid began on September 7th, the number of casualties has decreased every week, initially to 6,000, then to 3,000. However, the damage to houses is still significant. At the current rate of destruction, it would take ten years to destroy half of London's houses. However, before ten years pass, many things will have happened to Hitler and his Nazi regime, and Mussolini will have fully experienced what he did not expect when he stabbed France in the back.</p>
<h3>Adopting New Plans to Deal with Air Raids</h3>
<p>The question of what constitutes retaliation and what does not is not worth debating. We should not hope that winter will reduce the bombing. We may have new methods to make the large-scale bombing of civilians at night or in the fog more difficult work for the enemy than it is currently. I am not at liberty to explain these new methods at this time. It is better for the enemy to become aware of them from practical experience. We must, in the shortest possible time, provide everyone in areas that are frequently bombed with bomb shelters where they can place their bedding. We have now started a major plan to provide those sleeping in bomb shelters with food and hot water during winter nights, and the agency for assisting those whose homes have been destroyed is also expanding. The Financial Secretary has prepared a national mandatory insurance bill to protect against the destruction of real estate. The government also intends to implement insurance measures for various movable properties, including furniture. In this way, we can say that Hitler's attempt to terrorize the British people has completely failed. Even more certain is that the lack of water, electricity, etc., will not disrupt our maritime traffic.</p>
<h3>The Crisis is Not Over, Maintain Vigilance</h3>
<p>As for the German invasion of England, it cannot be said that the crisis is over. We must continue to actively strengthen naval, land, and air defenses. The main reason why the Germans have not yet carried out the invasion of England is that the British Air Force has won successive victories. The three major victories on August 15th, September 15th, and September 17th have shown the world that we have gained air superiority. With the Air Force victorious, the Navy's power is even more stable. Not only are American destroyers gradually joining the fleet, but reinforcements from other places are also arriving one after another. After months of air combat, the British Air Force is now stronger in both fighter and bomber aircraft than it was in May of this year, and the number of pilots is also rapidly improving. That Britain can catch up with the German Air Force in the first year of the war is something that the world never dreamed of before. Our progress is rapid, and next year at this time, comments on this matter will be even more satisfying.</p>
<h3>Reinforcements to the Middle East, Weather Improves</h3>
<p>The British Prime Minister spoke of reinforcements to the British forces in the Middle East and elsewhere, saying that it is impossible to predict the outcome when enemy forces travel far across the desert to attack, and British, Australian, New Zealand, Ceylon, Indian, and Egyptian troops surround them. However, I can say that we are currently doing our best. The weather is better now than it was some time ago.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Failure in West Africa</h3>
<p>The Prime Minister continued to speak of the Dakar campaign, saying that this was purely a French affair. Although the British side was prepared to provide assistance that could determine the situation in Dakar under certain circumstances, it did not wish to cause a long-term, violent conflict between General de Gaulle and the Vichy French. The British government will always assist de Gaulle until he achieves his goals and will never abandon him halfway. The overall situation in Dakar was adversely changed when three French cruisers and three destroyers arrived. All six ships carried supporters of Vichy, who were ordered to go to Dakar to intimidate the residents and guide the defenses. The British government's policy has always been not to interfere with the actions of Vichy French ships as long as they do not sail to enemy-controlled ports. On this occasion, the French ships approached the Strait of Gibraltar, and the First Lord of the Admiralty and the War Cabinet were initially unaware of it. By the time they received the report, it was too late to stop them. This was due to some mistakes, and is now a matter of military discipline. The government issued orders to stop the French ships at Casablanca, or, if that was not possible, to prevent them from entering Dakar. Neither of these measures was successful. However, the French ships were unable to carry out their plan to attack the port of Douala. Two of the French ships eventually entered the port of Dakar, while the other two were intercepted by British cruisers and turned back to Casablanca without using force. In the Dakar campaign, the Vichy side lost two submarines, one destroyer caught fire, and one cruiser was hit by artillery fire. The French battleship "Richelieu" also continued to suffer damage. As for the British side, one battleship and one large cruiser were damaged, but they are still capable of fighting with only minor repairs.</p>
<h3>Hope for Spain to Make Prudent Decisions</h3>
<p>Finally, the British Prime Minister spoke of Spain, saying that no country in the world needs peace, food, and prosperous trade more than Spain. Britain hopes that Spain will follow the right path and not lose its status as a major Mediterranean power. (Reuters)</p>
<h3>German Air Force Employs "Hammering Tactics"; Unprecedented Catastrophe for the British Isles; Bombed Area Spreads Across Eighty Districts; Aircraft Noise Never Ceased for a Minute from Last Night to This Morning</h3>
<p>London - Air Marshal Göring's pilots, last night and this morning, placed the British Isles on the anvil, hammering its vital organs everywhere. Black smoke billowed, intertwined, rose upwards, and obscured the sky, not dispersing for several hours until this morning. The German Air Force deployed a deadly enveloping maneuver in the British skies, launching its largest offensive since the start of the war, dropping explosive bombs and incendiary bombs, landing in eighty areas of this beleaguered country. Almost no part of England, Scotland, or Wales escaped the suppression of the German bombs. From dusk yesterday to this morning, several hundred German aircraft flew over London without a minute's rest. Countless fires broke out, and the fires had not been extinguished at the time of this reporter's dispatch. The extent of the destruction increased every hour, and the deaths continued. This air raid by German aircraft is likely to set a new record. London has suffered an unprecedented catastrophe, and the nearby towns and villages with dense populations have also suffered greatly. (International News Agency)</p>
<p>London - Last night and this morning, Nazi aircraft, operating over an unprecedentedly wide area of northern England, bombed over eighty towns, villages, and cities, including the London area. The night raid on the London area last night lasted only ten minutes less than the previous night. Before midnight, most of the German aircraft activity was concentrated in London. The British capital and its surrounding areas and suburbs suffered an unprecedentedly severe attack. Fierce anti-aircraft fire valiantly resisted the enemy. As the night deepened, the number of attackers gradually decreased, and by dawn, there was no sound in the air, and the anti-aircraft guns also ceased firing. Within minutes after the air raid siren sounded last night, a single German aircraft was spotted over London and dropped incendiary bombs. After that, large numbers of Messerschmitt fighters and bombers arrived, dropping incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs like rain, causing damage in many places. This morning's newspapers are full of news of the German "hammering tactics" threat, saying that this mad air raid by the Germans is the result of the heavy losses inflicted on Berlin by British aircraft on Sunday night. Most Londoners did not pay much attention to the air raids of the past two nights, as they have long become accustomed to spending long nights underground and only come out briefly to eat breakfast. Towns outside the London area, the southeastern coastal area, and inland counties suffered the most severe encounters, and bombs also fell in the southwest of England. A famous school was bombed.

<p>Germans Claim to Have Dropped Over 300 Tons of Bombs</p>
<p>The losses were severe, with a large train station and railway also being destroyed. Large fires broke out in northeastern and northern London, and there were four small fires in the city of London.</p>
<p>Berlin - Last night, German bombers dropped over 100 tons of bombs on London. Military targets were repeatedly hit by bombs, causing fires. (Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin - This afternoon, the German military bulletin stated that a German auxiliary cruiser sent a report from overseas stating that the ship had sunk 50,000 tons of enemy cargo. Yesterday and last night, the German Air Force continued to bomb London, as well as port facilities, arms factories, barracks, and supply depots in southern England. German aircraft also flew low to strafe aircraft parked on airfields with machine guns, and bombs fell within the airfields. German reconnaissance aircraft dropped several bombs on British merchant ships near the coast of Scotland, and the ships caught fire. A German aircraft bombed five troop transports escorted by British warships 200 kilometers from the coast of Scotland. One was severely damaged and stopped. A total of sixteen enemy aircraft were lost yesterday, twelve of which were shot down in aerial combat and four were destroyed by anti-aircraft fire. Three German aircraft were missing. (Haitong Telegram)</p>
<p>British Official Report Details of the Attack</p>
<p>London - The official report stated that the material damage and loss of life in London yesterday were minor. A bomb in a certain main road destroyed two buses, killing or seriously injuring several people. Several enemy aircraft that flew over London yesterday morning were shot down by British fighters. Although traffic was congested when bombs fell in several locations, there were not many casualties. A train was crushed by rubble, killing several passengers. Enemy aircraft then flew low to attack, destroying an air-raid shelter and several factories. A few bombs also fell elsewhere in southeastern England yesterday morning, but there were no significant material or life losses. British coastal aircraft also shot down two enemy aircraft in the English Channel. No British aircraft were lost. Enemy aircraft attacking England were unable to penetrate inland and indiscriminately dropped bombs on coastal towns in Kent and Sussex. Several houses were damaged and there were some casualties. The southwest of England was also attacked yesterday afternoon, with damage to several houses and a factory. There were not many casualties. A total of seven German aircraft were shot down yesterday.

<p>Famous German Pilot Captured</p>
<p>London - A Messerschmitt fighter aircraft from General Göring's elite "Yellow Nose" squadron was shot down into the sea between Dover and Folkestone yesterday afternoon by a Spitfire British fighter. The pilot of the German aircraft was an outstanding pilot from the "Yellow Nose" squadron, and he has been captured by the British. He is young, six feet tall, and wears the Iron Cross First Class and Second Class. His aircraft was destroyed and crashed into the sea not far from the coast. The pilot escaped, and the aircraft was not damaged. He waded ashore and was captured by a sentry. (Reuters)</p>

<h3>Far East Crisis Intensifies; Britain and the United States Seek Close Cooperation; Britain's Position Significantly Strengthened Compared to Before; United States Moving Towards a Brave Path</h3>
<p>Washington - British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, announced last night that he had canceled his plan to fly back to London this week because the British Foreign Office had informed him that the crisis in the Far East was imminent. The British Ambassador made this statement after discussing the Far East situation with President Roosevelt. The British Ambassador indicated that Britain anticipated a crisis in the Far East as a result of London's decision to reopen the Burma Road on October 17 to transport war materials to Chongqing. (Associated Press)</p>
<p>Washington - British Ambassador Lord Lothian has canceled his plan to return to England for vacation because the White House feels that a crisis may occur in the Far East as a result of Britain's decision to reopen the Burma Road. The cancellation of the return plan was announced by the Ambassador after visiting President Roosevelt at the White House. Although he refused to elaborate on the details of the meeting, he made it clear that it was to discuss the Far East situation. When asked when the British government expected the Far East crisis to occur, he replied that the crisis might come as a result of the reopening of the Burma Road. He had originally planned to sail to England on Sunday, but on Sunday he felt that this trip was not appropriate, and yesterday he canceled it. U.S. Secretary of State Hull met with Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi yesterday. Horinouchi, who will soon leave the United States for Japan, had come to say goodbye to Hull. At Hull's special request, they met secretly at the State Department for 40 minutes. It is reported that Hull explained to him his views on the overall situation in the Far East. Many believe that Hull also issued a warning about Japan's attitude in bringing the United States to its current position. According to the decision of the U.S. Department of State to advise American expatriates in the Far East to return to the United States, the American citizens involved, including Chinese and Japanese citizens, total 11,000. (Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington - Political figures believe that the U.S. government's advice to expatriates to leave the Far East is greatly related to the reopening of the Burma Road. The Department of State issued instructions to American consuls stationed in [Manchukuo], Hong Kong, China, and Indochina, ordering them to advise American expatriates to return to the United States as soon as possible, which in fact indicates that Britain and the United States will cooperate closely in the Far East and adopt a strong position in Asia. In order to save face, Japan may be forced to take some kind of retaliatory action when the Burma Road is reopened. However, many believe that the reason why the United States advised expatriates to leave dangerous areas may be for this reason. Today's newspapers in Washington all carried this advice with excitement. One newspaper, which takes a conservative attitude towards foreign news, also placed a large headline before the news, saying, "The situation in the Far East seems to be moving towards 'giving color'." International intelligence observers in Washington commented today that Britain's position is significantly stronger than when the British government thought it should reach a compromise with Japan on the Burma Road three months ago. The reason why these observers say this is because Britain has succeeded in resisting German air raids and is gradually reducing the possibility of a German invasion of England. In addition, everyone believes that President Roosevelt's and political opponent Willkie's foreign policies have the same goal by different routes, which is also the main reason for enhancing the U.S. position. Political observers also pointed out that the President was able to issue the evacuation warning so rashly without worrying about the outcome of the November election. Some military writers recently advocated that the United States should take practical actions to curb Japan's actions. These writers believe that now is the best time for the United States to take such action. Japan cannot gain any advantage from its triangular alliance with the Axis powers, because Germany and Italy have poured all their strength into the war against England. (Associated Press)</p>
<p>Hull Meets with Horinouchi, Expresses a Firm Attitude</p>
<p>Washington - According to well-informed sources here, the suspicions held by Tokyo in the past regarding the U.S.'s firm attitude in maintaining the status quo in the Pacific have now been completely dispelled. Secretary of State Hull's meeting with Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi yesterday, together with the news of the U.S. advising American expatriates in the Far East to return to their country, has great significance. The Secretary of State's attitude was calm, and his conversation was gentle. However, his actions yesterday were unusual. Anyone who knows Hull knows that Hull only acts this way when necessary. Hull had this posture for the first time when he recently met with the new ambassador Henry Hay. As a result, Henry Hay preferred to meet with other officials of the State Department rather than contacting Hull. It is assumed that when the report of Horinouchi's meeting with Hull is sent to Tokyo, the Japanese hawks will know to what extent the United States is prepared to act. This is confirmed by British Ambassador Lothian's statement that he did not return to London because of the risk of a crisis in the Far East. Political observers believe that these two incidents show that the policies of the U.S. and the U.K. towards the East are closer than before. As some people expect, some observers even believe that the U.S. and the U.K. have verbally agreed that if the Japanese Navy removes the gun coverings and an emergency situation arises, the U.S. can use the Singapore naval base. All of these developments are entirely the responsibility of Japan itself, as Japan has publicly placed itself in opposition to the U.K. and the U.S. by announcing its collaboration with the Axis powers, which has greatly displeased American public opinion. Everyone here believes that the U.S. warning to American expatriates in the Far East to prepare to return home and Lothian's remarks are not intended to produce any effect, but to show that Japan is shooting itself in the foot, making its relations with the two major democratic countries more dangerous. All parties welcome the news of the reopening of the Burma Road, believing that this is a sound British policy and that it is a sign that the U.S. and the U.K. are working hand in hand in the Far East, or at least are now moving forward side by side.

<p>U.S. Marines May Withdraw from China</p>
<p>Washington - Secretary of State Hull said here yesterday that the U.S. Marines may withdraw from China soon. When asked if the State Department's advice to American expatriates to withdraw from the Far East was a prelude to the withdrawal of the Marines, Hull replied that he would have something to say about this matter in a few days. After Hull met with the press, a spokesman for the Department of State immediately stated that the issue of the withdrawal of the U.S. Navy from China had not yet been formally discussed, but would be considered in the near future. Hull refused to disclose the contents of his 40-minute conversation with Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi yesterday, but he said that they did not discuss the details of the current U.S.-Japan relationship. Hull said that he did not notify Horinouchi of the State Department's decision to advise American expatriates to evacuate the Far East. He did not expect the Japanese government to issue a similar order to withdraw American expatriates in Japan. A Department of State spokesman said yesterday that there are 7,064 American expatriates currently residing in China, 128 in Vietnam, 1,547 in Hong Kong, and 8,145 in Japan. The spokesman said that American consuls in the Far East have been ordered to report to the Department of State the number of expatriates prepared to return to the United States immediately. A Department of State spokesman said that this advice is parallel to the policies adopted in the Far East and Europe last year. Department of State officials said that American expatriates should leave as soon as possible, as ships in the Far East may soon be unavailable. (Associated Press)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt refused to comment on the situation in the Far East when he met with the press yesterday.

<h3>Britain's Far East Policy: A New Chapter Begins - Close Cooperation with China, the United States, and the Soviet Union - Ambassador Guo Speaks in London</h3>
<p>London - Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi told reporters last night that the reopening of the Burma Road was a matter of deep satisfaction, but not surprising. The result of the road's closure was precisely Japan's immediate arrest of British nationals, invasion of Vietnam, and conclusion of a military alliance with Germany and Italy. The news of the reopening of the Burma Road will give the Chinese people hope that Britain's Far East policy has now begun a new chapter, namely close cooperation with China, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

<h3>President Roosevelt Meets with Naval Officials - Studies Geography of Both Hemispheres - Part of the Fleet to Return to Honolulu</h3>
<p>Washington - US Fleet Commander Admiral Richardson told reporters yesterday that a portion of the US fleet currently in California will soon return to Honolulu. Richardson's remarks were made after a two-hour meeting with President Roosevelt. It is reported that Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark also participated in the meeting. Admiral Richardson also stated that, in addition, "several thousand sailors deemed necessary" will also return to Honolulu from California with the fleet. He said that yesterday's meeting reported to President Roosevelt on the preparations for the fleet's actions. When asked if the fleet was fully prepared, he said that the fleet was "not as well prepared as hoped." He said that he hoped that the world situation would allow the remaining fleet to visit California before leaving, but he could not confirm the exact date of the fleet's departure from Honolulu. However, he said that the Honolulu fleet would not leave immediately before the fleet in California arrived in Honolulu. Also, after a two-hour meeting with naval officials, President Roosevelt will meet with British Ambassador Lothian to discuss the developments in the Far East situation. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt said that when he met with US Fleet Commander Admiral Richardson and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark yesterday, most of the time was spent studying maps and "learning geography."

<h3>Canada Announces Copper Export Ban - Clearly Aimed at Japan</h3>
<p>Ottawa - The Canadian government today announced a ban on the export of copper to all countries except those that constitute the British Empire and perhaps the United States. It is widely believed that this move is fundamentally aimed at Japan. Although the embargo announcement issued after today's cabinet meeting here does not specifically mention Japan, it is believed to be directed at that country, as Japan's total copper imports, one-third of which comes from British Columbia. The announcement stated that, in view of the needs of the British Empire and the increasing consumption of copper by Canadian manufacturing plants, all copper in Canada will be used to meet these needs. The announcement also continued that copper exports to the United States may continue, as the United States must now complete arms contracts with Allied countries.

<h3>US Wheat Shipments to the East - Subsidies Suspended - Department of Agriculture Has Begun Implementation</h3>
<p>Washington - Washington, seeing the situation in the Far East approaching a critical stage, the US Department of Agriculture yesterday decided to suspend the export subsidy program for wheat shipped to Far Eastern ports other than the Philippines. Previously, the US government subsidized wheat and flour shipped from the Pacific coast to ports in Hong Kong and China (mostly under Japanese control). According to Department of Agriculture officials, the suspension of subsidies was approved by the State Department. It is estimated that 10 million bushels of subsidized wheat and flour have been shipped to Far Eastern ports since January 1. Department of Agriculture officials declined to comment on the impact of this move on Japan. An official said that it is not known whether US wheat will be shipped to Japan proper or transferred to Japanese troops in China, but Japanese troops in China may have already obtained some US wheat.

<h3>Japanese Securities in New York - Prices Plunge - Affected by the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>New York - The New York stock market was extremely stable at one point today, but closed extremely unstable. This was the market's reaction to the report from Washington that the State Department had advised consulates to evacuate overseas Chinese from the Far East as soon as possible. Japanese stocks fell sharply at the close, while the general public continued to watch the development of this situation, as stockbrokers still wanted to make further speculations. Among these various factors, the most unsettling for businessmen was public opinion and the result of the presidential election. Most of them are inclined to President Roosevelt, but trading is still very good. Private property has increased by 22% compared to last year, and the contracts ordered by the government total $7,000,000,000. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>

<h3>Minister of Economic Affairs, Weng Wenhao, Discusses General Economic Conditions - Reopening of Yunnan-Burma Road May Lower Prices - Optimistic About the Future of Industrial Construction in the West</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Minister of Economic Affairs of the National Government, Weng Wenhao, met with a Havas News Agency interviewer today and gave a speech. First, he expressed his views on the possibility of war with Japan in the future due to the United States' advice to overseas Chinese to evacuate China. He said that if the United States and Japan were to go to war one day, the result would be the collapse of Japan and the restoration of China's freedom. In my personal opinion, the key to the current situation lies in the Soviet Union. Therefore, the United States and the Soviet Union should strengthen their relations, because if the Soviet Union maintains a hostile attitude towards Japan, Japan will have to maintain a huge defense force in Manchuria. As far as the general economic situation in China is concerned, the salaried class is the most distressed after the price rise. The government is working hard to balance prices to remedy this. The rise in prices in the interior is due to the fact that the production mechanism has not yet been industrialized, which requires a large number of imported goods, coupled with extremely high transportation costs, especially after the successive blockade of the Yunnan-Vietnam and Yunnan-Burma roads, transportation costs have become more expensive, which indirectly promotes the price increase of daily necessities. There are some unscrupulous merchants who hoard goods, but under the strict supervision of the government, they dare not openly hoard goods. It is expected that the prices of various daily necessities will gradually fall back on the day the Yunnan-Burma Road reopens. In addition, the United States recently loaned China 25 million US dollars, which has increased the value of legal currency. This loan can not only be used to purchase American goods, but also to consolidate the reserve and stabilize the currency price. At present, the industrialization construction work in various parts of western China has been obstructed due to the threat of air raids from time to time, but the government is still working hard to encourage and support it, and the future is promising. Moreover, the industrialization movement is not the main problem today. Even if China maintains the form of an agricultural country, it can continue to resist the war to conquer Japan. In short, the total production value of the industries moved from the southeastern provinces this year has reached 300 million yuan. If there are no accidents, it can be greatly increased next year.

<h3>Japan's Trade Prospects - Extremely Difficult to be Optimistic</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Finance Minister Ikeda said in a speech at the National Prefectural Governors' Conference yesterday that gold is a necessary item for clearing international accounts. He said that Japan is now planning to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and there is no doubt that it will need a huge amount of gold in the future. He believes that it is extremely difficult to be optimistic about the future of trade with third countries due to the current situation. Finally, Finance Minister urged the prefectural governors to cooperate with the government to increase the production of new minerals and find ways to accumulate gold. Following the speech by Hoshino, a member of the cabinet in charge of national planning, he said that the government is now revising its trade policy in order to obtain the supply of infant raw materials from Latin American countries, French Vietnam, and the Dutch East Indies, in order to replace those purchased from the United Kingdom, the United States, and their colonies. The government had expected the United Kingdom and the United States to impose an embargo on Japan, so it had already obtained a large number of raw materials in advance, which he said were for war purposes. The United States' ban on the shipment of scrap iron to Japan has had little impact on Japan, but various possible steps are being taken to obtain the supply of oil. According to reports, the meeting paid close attention to the economic pressure exerted on Japan by the United Kingdom and the United States. Therefore, the finance minister and others gave speeches to reassure the public. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Today's National Day Commemoration - Shanghai Celebrates with Flags - Foreign Consulates in Shanghai are on Holiday - Citizens Actively Promote Charity Sales and Donations - The Two Concessions Intensify Security and Impose Curfew Earlier Last Night</h3>
<p>Today is the 29th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. All sectors of the city are celebrating with flags in accordance with the regulations of the authorities, as it is an extraordinary time and no celebration in the Russian style will be held. All shops and households in the city of Jinshi are celebrating with flags in accordance with the regulations of the authorities. All industries, markets, major companies, factories, and institutions such as banks, customs, and post offices will be closed for one day. In order to express their celebration, the citizens are expanding and promoting the Cold Clothing Festival storage movement during this festive season. Companies and shops that are open as usual will voluntarily hold charity sales for one day and present the proceeds. Shops that are closed today will hold charity sales for one day tomorrow. The authorities of the two concessions have announced an earlier curfew last night to protect the security of the concessions. The Great World Amusement Park, located in an important location, has been advised by the French patrol to close down for the past two days. The details are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Foreign Missions Celebrate Together</p>
<p>Embassies and consulates of various countries, including the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Germany, and Italy, are also closed for one day today to commemorate the National Day of the Republic of China and celebrate together. The consuls-general of various countries have informed the public yesterday that various public affairs will resume tomorrow. In addition, warships of various countries stationed in the Pei River will also fly flags for one day today to commemorate the National Day of the Republic of China. At that time, colorful flags will be flying over the Huangpu River, symbolizing China's victory in the war of resistance and the success of nation-building.</p>
<p>Actively Promoting Cold Clothing Funds</p>
<p>Since all sectors of the city launched the campaign to raise 500,000 yuan for cold clothing funds, they have actively promoted it and spared no effort. The response from various shops and factories to this campaign and their self-proclaimed donations has been very enthusiastic, so the predetermined figure of 500,000 yuan will be exceeded, as there are still two weeks until the deadline of the 31st of this month. In addition to enthusiastically soliciting cold clothing funds, people from all walks of life will also work hard to promote saving for disaster relief, building the country, charity sales for National Day, and other tasks on Double Ten Day today to express the meaning of warmly celebrating National Day. It is reported that film actor Li Qinian donated 100 yuan in national currency to the bank yesterday in response to the cold clothing funds, as a way to promote it.</p>
<p>The City is Under Strict Security</p>
<p>Today is National Day, and the authorities of the two concessions have tightened security within the concessions to eliminate the troublemaking of bad elements that hinder public order. On the Public Concession side, at midnight yesterday, non-important roads along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch were blocked with barbed wire obstacles to prevent traffic. At the important intersections, entrances and exits were set up, and various national defense forces and the International Volunteer Corps were stationed to check vehicles and pedestrians. On the French Concession side, because the entrances along Avenue Edward VII were mostly blocked earlier, it was only necessary to strengthen the defense within the concession. In addition to the full mobilization of the police department's armored vehicles, gun vehicles, and patrol teams, the French defense forces also participated in the patrol. As for western Shanghai, since the previous day, Japanese vehicles have been searching pedestrians and vehicles on Yugu Road. Yesterday, a large team of Japanese troops patrolled in formation on Kaixuan Road and Zhongshan Road. The Japanese troops in Nanshi and Zhabei were also under abnormal security.</p>
<h3>Southwest Postal Transport - Surveying New Lines</h3>
<p>When Shanghai Postmaster Zha Peilin went to Kunming this summer, he transferred to Haiphong for inspection. Officials from Chongqing and Chengdu also went to inspect. Recently, the Director-General of Posts also sent Deputy Director-General Xu Changcheng to inspect various parts of the southwest. Now that he has completed his inspection, new postal routes between Shanghai and the southwest will soon be opened up, and transportation efficiency will definitely be improved.</p>
<h3>Unified Public Bonds, Class C - Winning Numbers</h3>
<p>The tenth principal repayment of the 25th year of the Republic of China Unified Public Bonds was drawn at 10:00 am yesterday. This was the tenth principal repayment, drawing eight lots, each worth 350,000 yuan, for a total of 2.8 million yuan in principal to be repaid. The principal to be paid for the winning bonds and the accrued interest will be paid starting from January 31, 30th year. The method of principal and interest repayment will be stipulated and announced by the Ministry of Finance when it is due. The winning numbers are eight lots: 115, 226, 361, 479, 573, 625, 769, 902. The principal and interest for each bond drawn this time will be discounted and paid by the four banks.</p>
<h3>Letter from the Bureau of Works to the Evaluation Committee - Ruling on Shanghai Rice Prices - Rationed Sales Proceed in Stages and are Not Suspended</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Works recently sent a letter to the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee stating that, according to the opinion of the Bureau's Food Committee, the selling price of foreign rice in the city should not exceed the actual cost plus a reasonable profit. As for the amount of the so-called reasonable profit, the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee can decide at its discretion. After the price of foreign rice is evaluated, the price of domestic rice</p>
<p>Top-Grade White Rice</p>
<p>Should also be evaluated by the committee for a fair selling price. Furthermore, if the committee has difficulties in investigating the actual cost of foreign rice, the Bureau's Price Investigation Office will find ways to assist it. According to sources familiar with the matter, in the future, all transaction prices and dates of arrival of foreign rice, as well as the quantity of domestic rice, must be submitted to the relevant authorities for record from the date of the transaction of a certain foreign rice. Otherwise, it will be regarded as illegal hoarding and will be severely punished, or its business license will be revoked. Furthermore, according to the report published by the Bureau of Works yesterday regarding the rationed sale of foreign rice, it seems that it will be permanently suspended, which does not conform to</p>
<p>The Facts</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rationed Sales Committee currently has 28,000 bags of Saigon broken rice. The committee will convene a meeting to decide on the next rationed sales date. As for the rationed sales matters, proceeding in stages is a consistent method of the committee. As for the</p>
<p>Afternoon Rice Market</p>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the standing committee member of the Bean and Rice Industry Association, recently suggested to the association that, at a time when the production price of foreign rice is soaring and the source of domestic rice is scarce, and the cost of transportation for our fellow traders is difficult, if trading is conducted in two markets, not only will the market price fluctuate, but it will also affect public morale. The Rice Evaluation Committee, in view of this, resolutely sent a letter to the Grain Association to announce the suspension of rice trading in the afternoon market. However, recently, some traders have treated it as a mere formality and acted against it. After investigation, they have not taken actual sales as the end, but have engaged in speculative trading among fellow traders, rising and falling suddenly, causing a stir in the newspapers. At this time of turbulent situation and uncertain public sentiment, it is not appropriate. Therefore, it is suggested that the ban order be reiterated. I believe that there are many fellow traders who are deeply aware of the situation, and at this time of food panic, we should all have a heart of compassion and no longer engage in speculative trading.</p>
<p>Association Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, in view of the fact that if traders in the rice market do not trade according to the market, it will have a great impact on the entire rice market. Now, in order to discuss a proper solution, the association has scheduled a joint meeting of all supervisors and committee members at 2:00 pm on the 11th of this month at 15 Avenue Edward VII to discuss the overall solution for the entire rice market. All members will attend the meeting on time to discuss. The Shanghai Cereals, Oil Cake Industry Association has also scheduled a committee meeting on October 12 to discuss the trading method for the cereals exchange.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Vehicles Overturn at Waikatang - Eight Vehicles - Triggered Landmines - Heavy Casualties</h3>
<p>It is said that the Japanese army in Suzhou has been very empty recently, and its small strongholds such as Huangdai, Jiaozhi, and the garrison in Donglai Town and Luyuan in Changshu have all withdrawn. On the 4th of this month, Hua guerrilla team Yang department, team leader Zhu, led the team to bury landmines between Guandu and Waikatang outside the city at midnight. At 5:00 am on the 5th, there were ten Japanese military vehicles, traveling from west to east. The landmines exploded at that location, overturning eight vehicles (including one soldier vehicle, one food vehicle, and six ammunition vehicles). Forty-seven Japanese soldiers were killed or injured, while Yang's troops safely returned to their defense area after completing their mission.</p>
<h3>Xu Busun Released from Kidnapping - Rumored to be Redeemed</h3>
<p>Xu Busun, a Suzhou native who runs Tongfengyong Chiyu Shop at 310 Nanjing Road, was kidnapped at his residence in the car garage when he was about to get into his car and drive away the day before yesterday afternoon. The details have been reported in various newspapers. However, according to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, after Xu was kidnapped, he was hidden in a grass shed somewhere in western Shanghai. However, he did escape from the bandit's den at 11:20 pm that night and arrived at his residence at around 3:00 am the next morning. The car was also found at Zhaofeng Garden on Avenue Billiard. After the patrol notified Xu's residence, the car has not yet been driven back and is still in the patrol's possession. As for Xu's escape and the whereabouts of the bandits, the reporter asked him at home, but he refused to reveal the truth, but admitted that he had been released from kidnapping. However, because he suffered some injuries, he is now in the hospital for treatment. After further inquiries, it was learned that Xu's release from kidnapping was so fast because he had redeemed himself with a huge sum of money.</p>
<h3>Daylight Saving Time - Ends at Midnight the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The daylight saving time movement was previously decided by the Bureau of Works to end at midnight on the 12th of this month. At that time, all office clocks will be moved back one hour. The announcement has been widely publicized. The Bureau reissued a public notice yesterday urging citizens to pay attention. The post office also announced that it will return to the previous standard time at the same time.</p>

<h3>Preparations by American Residents in Shanghai: Women and Children to be Sent Home First; Boosts Morale for China's Resistance; All American Steamer Cabins Fully Booked</h3>
<p>Following the military and economic alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, Britain decided to abandon its previous appeasement policy and resolved to open the Burma Road on the 8th of this month. The United States also saw the alliance of these three countries as targeting itself and recognized the increasing tensions in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. It actively engaged in communication with allied nations, especially establishing close ties with Britain. It also provided substantial loans to aid China and support its resistance, while expanding its embargo against Japan, leading to increasing resource shortages. Furthermore, with Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox declaring acceptance of Japan's challenge, it's clear that Britain and the United States are determined not to allow aggressors to act arrogantly in the Far East but rather to protect their existing interests. This is evidenced by the recent sudden visit of former Commander of the U.S. Fleet in China, Admiral Harry E. Yarnell, to Shanghai to meet with Commander of the U.S. Far East Fleet, Admiral Thomas C. Hart, and the U.S. Secretary of State's urging of the evacuation of overseas residents from the Far East as a preparation for further actions. This situation clearly shows that Britain and the United States are jointly resisting aggression to respond to the alliance of Germany, Italy, and Japan, and to maintain the peace front of the two major oceans, which is gradually becoming clear. A reporter from Pingming News Agency, considering the U.S.'s action of urging the evacuation of overseas residents from the Far East and its significant impact on the current situation in Shanghai, inquired with various parties and compiled the following report:</p>
<p>Receiving Instructions and Interpreting Their Significance</p>
<p>Regarding the U.S. authorities in Washington's decision to evacuate their overseas residents from the Far East, the acting U.S. Consul General in Shanghai received instructions from the State Department last night. According to inquiries made by a Pingming News Agency reporter yesterday afternoon with responsible personnel at the U.S. Consulate, the evacuation of American residents in Shanghai would not be carried out through orders from the U.S. Consulate, but rather through notices, advising those overseas residents who do not need to stay in the Far East to return home. The so-called American residents who do not need to stay in the Far East are limited to those who have no business or mission in the Far East, such as American male tourists in the Far East's designated evacuation areas, as well as general women and children. Those who have business or missions in the Far East are not currently included in the advisory to evacuate and return home. Therefore, American commercial institutions in Shanghai, as well as American-owned banks and newspapers, are continuing to operate as usual.</p>
<p>Consideration for the U.S. Marines</p>
<p>The situation in the Far East has become increasingly tense due to the U.S.'s decision to evacuate non-essential overseas residents from the Far East. Yesterday morning, authoritative sources among foreigners in Shanghai further disseminated an important piece of news, stating that the U.S. Marine Detachment in Shanghai would also be evacuated from Shanghai. After obtaining this information, a Pingming News Agency reporter immediately inquired with relevant parties of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. It was learned that the U.S. defense force currently stationed in Shanghai is the 4th Marine Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps, numbering about a thousand men. A decision has been made to prepare for evacuation, but the date of evacuation has not yet been determined. The evacuation steps are currently under consideration by the naval authorities.</p>
<p>The Chaumont Transport Ship to Arrive in Shanghai Next Month</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", officers of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai told reporters today (9th) that they had not received official news regarding the possible evacuation of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in China. It is reported that the 4th U.S. Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai has a thousand soldiers, and the U.S. North China Marine Corps has five hundred soldiers, stationed in Beijing and Tianjin, led by Colonel Walter N. Hill. The next U.S. Navy transport ship to arrive in Shanghai, the "Chaumont," is scheduled to arrive in the first week of November. One hundred and twenty American soldiers stationed in Shanghai are scheduled to return to the United States on the "Chaumont." However, if necessary, the "Chaumont" can accommodate all U.S. troops stationed in China.</p>
<p>Prepared to Accept the Challenge</p>
<p>An observer first elaborated on the significance of the U.S. evacuation of its overseas residents, stating that this move is purely a precautionary measure and is not caused by any special situation. Therefore, we should not overemphasize it. Because the United States is bold and meticulous, in case the situation in the Far East changes, it will not be negligent in protecting the safety of overseas residents. The reason why the United States is doing this is actually due to Japan's challenging behavior. In other words, the United States is prepared to accept Japan's challenge. As for the evacuation of American residents in Shanghai, the official order has not yet been received. At present, only some Americans are leaving Shanghai voluntarily, mostly women and children. Various American organizations and businesses are also only taking a wait-and-see attitude. As for the full evacuation, it will not be possible to achieve in the very short term. Once the government's official order arrives, the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai and relevant authorities will begin registration and investigation procedures. Currently, there are nearly ten thousand American residents in Shanghai. The observer commented on the U.S. evacuation of the U.S. Marine Detachment from the Far East, saying that the U.S. troops stationed in the Far East, apart from the Philippines, are only in North China and Shanghai, and the number is not large. If this force is evacuated, it will only be relocated to the U.S. Far East base, and will not reduce the Far East force. It is actually a concentration of force. At that time, the U.S. fleet will be stationed dynamically, and the expansion of our troops will depend on the situation. All of the above, we still feel is too early to say. The U.S. measures are extremely procedural actions, and are by no means predictable by the general public.</p>
<p>American Institutions Maintain Calm</p>
<p>Yesterday, the news of the American evacuation of overseas residents had a quite drastic impact on Shanghai. On the American side, such as organizations and groups, the attitude was very calm. However, private individuals were slightly more nervous, and small-scale businesses were making preparations. Deposits and withdrawals at American-owned banks were also more frequent than usual. Those who have no legitimate business have made preparations to return home by ship. However, major American companies, banks, and businesses are operating as usual, and are even busier than usual. According to information obtained by reporters from the American President Lines, the American steamer bound for the United States, the "President Pierce," will set sail on October 28th. The cabins on the upper and lower decks of the ship are fully booked. Next month, the "President Coolidge" will set sail on November 7th. There are only a few berths remaining in the steerage of the ship. Most of the passengers on both ships are women and children who are voluntarily leaving Shanghai. As for the future orderly evacuation, the government authorities will send ships to transport them.</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Do Not Mention This at All</p>
<p>Japanese and other foreign residents here attach great importance to the U.S. evacuation of overseas residents. The Japanese residents are slightly panicked, and the Japanese newspapers do not mention this news at all. It is also heard that Japanese businesses are preparing to abandon trade with the United States. As for other foreigners, although they feel that the U.S.'s move shows great determination to protect its interests in the Far East, they remain calm and await future developments, with no signs of unrest. Foreign newspapers only publish this news in a secondary position. However, the general sentiment tends to be excited.</p>
<p>The Current Situation in the Concessions Will Not Change</p>
<p>The Chinese side believes that this news is extremely beneficial to China's resistance, so they are very excited. Yesterday, a reporter asked a key figure familiar with municipal affairs about the impact of the American evacuation of overseas residents on the status of Shanghai. It was said that although we cannot predict how the situation will change in the future, the situation in Shanghai is special, as it is an internationally co-managed city. If one country abandons its jurisdiction, then other countries will come out to co-manage. Moreover, the American executives of the concession authorities will remain in Shanghai, so there will definitely be no change. Foreign property in the two concessions is extremely valuable, and no one will be allowed to infringe upon it. Whether it is police power or political power, everything will remain the same. This can be foreseen from the current situation after the withdrawal of British troops. However, the Chinese side currently has sufficient floating capital, which will have a greater impact on foreign trade in the future. The general bourgeoisie can take this opportunity to transfer surplus funds to the Chinese mainland to develop beneficial industrial and commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>Financial Market Fluctuations Started Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the financial market in Shanghai was most affected by the news of the American evacuation of overseas residents. The situation throughout the day was extremely turbulent, with rumors flying, and the news was bearish. Most of the bulls competed to sell, foreign exchange rates fell sharply, and gold prices plummeted, showing a completely unsustainable situation. However, because all parties believe that this news is beneficial to China, various public bonds were strong. The market situation throughout the day was as follows: spot silver opened at 5,580 yuan in the morning, and then gradually declined, falling to a low of 5,480 yuan, and closed at 5,505 yuan at noon. The black market foreign exchange rates for both British and American currencies fell sharply. The British exchange rate opened at 3 pence 75 in the morning, and rose to 3 pence 8125 at noon. The American exchange rate also fell sharply, opening at 5.75 yuan in the morning, and then gradually rose to 5.875 yuan. Finally, it fell below the 6 yuan mark, to 6.03125 yuan. Public bonds rose slightly by 1 or 2 corners, American bonds fell to 16.4 yuan, and Hong Kong bonds were 3.93 yuan. All stocks trended downward. Yesterday afternoon was a short holiday without a market, and today's National Day anniversary is also a market holiday. It is expected that there will still be major changes when the market opens tomorrow.</p>
<p>All Steamer Cabins Fully Booked</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press", yesterday (8th), after the U.S. Secretary of State instructed the consulate in Shanghai to advise American residents to leave Shanghai, British residents here were extremely shocked. According to opinions from the American residents, a complete evacuation is impossible because there are not enough ships. The cabins of all American President Line steamers are fully booked until December. The "President Coolidge," which will arrive in the Far East at the end of December, still has a few cabins available for booking. Other Pacific steamers, besides the President Line, only have the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company and the Nippon Yusen Kaisha lines. However, according to employees of the American President Lines, if the situation is urgent, the U.S. government will order the U.S. Maritime Commission to send ships to the Far East to evacuate American residents, or perhaps the President Line steamers will assume this responsibility. Nearly two hundred American residents have come to the American President Lines to inquire daily. The cabins for the next three ships are fully booked, and only the "President Coolidge" on the 12th still has some cabins available. It is also said that if the U.S. Maritime Commission receives government orders and implements emergency regulations, the President Line steamers will have to add temporary beds to facilitate the evacuation of American residents. American residents returning to the country must pay their own expenses. Those who cannot afford tickets will be loaned by the U.S. government, but they must repay them later. The U.S. Consulate is now also in contact with leaders of various church groups, advising them to evacuate their wives and children first. Some missionaries may be forced to return to the United States on the "President Coolidge," which will arrive in Shanghai on the 23rd of this month. It is also heard that the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai will issue a notice within days, advising overseas residents to evacuate women and children.</p>

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Banks Uniformly Stop Foreign Exchange Arbitrage; Black Market Exchange Rate Has No Profit to Arbitrage Since the New Sino-American Loan Was Successfully Negotiated</h3>
<p>Since the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee has made every effort to maintain foreign exchange rates, necessary imports can apply for legal foreign exchange, and the government purchases foreign exchange from major domestic exports. Therefore, the legal foreign exchange rate of the Central Bank has always been stable. The Anglo-American commercial banks are authorized to maintain the foreign exchange rate of the black market in Shanghai. Now, in order to prevent speculative manipulation of the foreign exchange market, Chinese and foreign banks have formally passed a resolution to stop foreign exchange arbitrage, in addition to restricting forward transactions and swaps. All member banks of the Chinese and foreign commercial banking associations will uniformly abide by the resolution.</p>
<p>Official Approval by the Association</p>
<p>The black market exchange rate in Shanghai is secretly maintained by the HSBC and other banks authorized by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee. Since the successful negotiation of the Sino-American 25 million U.S. dollar loan, the black market exchange rate has lengthened, and the value of the legal tender has invisibly increased. In order to prevent speculators from manipulating the foreign exchange market, British and American banks have consulted and decided to refuse forward foreign exchange transactions and restrict the expiration of foreign exchange, so that speculators cannot apply their skills. However, in fact, because the elements of the foreign exchange market are complicated, the operators have not thoroughly handled it, so the trend of speculation has not completely disappeared. Now, the Shanghai Banking Association and the Foreign Bankers Association have formally passed the cessation of foreign exchange arbitrage. All member banks of the two associations shall comply. It is said that its purpose is to prevent speculators from manipulating the foreign exchange market and to seek the lasting stability of the black market exchange rate in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Arbitrage Disappears Invisibly</p>
<p>The recent value of the foreign exchange market is cheap enough to absorb sellers, and the forward value is expensive enough to absorb sellers. Therefore, those with surplus funds come out for arbitrage, buying near and selling far. The recent market price should gradually increase, and the forward exchange rate should gradually decrease. When the difference between the two is close to zero, there is no profit to arbitrage. Therefore, arbitrage is not sustainable, and must be done when there is an opportunity. At the same time, it is limited to those with strength to do it. Therefore, whenever the market is unusually tight on money, the more opportunities there are for arbitrage. The best arbitrage can get as much as 70-80% interest. However, the current black market exchange rate in Shanghai has no profit to arbitrage for the time being. If all banks can uniformly refuse forward foreign exchange transactions, foreign exchange arbitrage can be eliminated invisibly.</p>
<h3>Cixi Urban Area Bombed; Japanese Warships Bomb Jintang Mountain</h3>
<p>According to telegrams received by the navigation industry this morning, four Japanese aircraft bombed Cixi on the 8th. According to the telegram, at 9:20 a.m. the day before yesterday,</p>
<p>Four Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>Passed Ninghai, swept over Fenghua Creek, flew over Ningbo and entered Cixi airspace, circling and dropping bombs, indiscriminately bombing. Nine explosive bombs were dropped one after another. After the Japanese aircraft dropped their bombs, they escaped out to sea from the Guanhaiwei area. The heads of various agencies in Cixi immediately mobilized to express condolences to the families affected by the disaster. Various rescue and fire-fighting organizations worked at risk when the alarm had not yet been lifted, and emotions were tense.</p>
<p>The bombs all fell in the urban area, including two bombs falling in Taiyang Temple, killing one person and destroying five houses; one bomb falling in Zhongren Elementary School, destroying nine houses; three bombs falling in Yu Huang Pavilion, injuring one girl and destroying six houses; one bomb falling on an open space outside Xiaodongmen; and one bomb falling next to Zhongma Bridge, destroying more than ten houses. In total, two people were killed, five people were injured, and dozens of houses were destroyed in this battle, with no other losses. Also, at 9:10 a.m. the day before yesterday, a Japanese warship sailed to Chuanshan ocean area and fired at Jintang Mountain,</p>
<p>Eight Shells Fired</p>
<p>The shells fell on open ground with no losses. Also, two Japanese warships outside the Zhenhai estuary suddenly fired eleven shells at Jiangnan Guanmu at around 11:00 a.m., all of which fell into the mud, with no losses to China. Currently, there are still four Japanese warships moored in the Seaport waters, with no movements. Also, according to people from Dinghai, on September 26th and 27th, the Japanese army Kushima Shigeo unit in Dingcheng suddenly sent two bombers, each carrying a large number of bombs, which took off from near the Minsheng Refined Salt Company in Dinghai Donggangpu and flew to Zhoushan, Ma Pan, Gan Lan, Ziwei and other places, flying low to drop bombs. Ma Pan suffered the most damage.</p>
<h3>Gong Bida's Injuries Still Serious</h3>
<p>Gong Bida, a Hubei native and deputy inspector of the French police, No. 214, was ambushed at the entrance of the Rihui Lane, Xinxin Street, Dapuqiao, Jin Shenfu Road, at noon on the 8th. He was shot twice in the back and was sent to Guangci Hospital afterwards. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that his injuries have not diminished slightly. Although there was no change throughout yesterday, he is still in a coma.</p>
<h3>French Tramway Labor Strike to Be Mediated Again</h3>
<p>The labor strike at the French Concession Water and Electricity Company has been delayed for two weeks. The two sides have negotiated several times, and most of them have been agreed. Only one or two important issues remain to be discussed. It is reported that Yuan Ludeng went to the company on the afternoon of the 8th to discuss a solution. The company stated that the labor side should resume work first, and then negotiate various issues. It is heard that Yuan and Yu Qiaqing will once again serve as mediators in order to resolve the labor strike as soon as possible. There was still no contact between the labor and management sides yesterday. It is also learned that a total of nineteen inspectors and ticket writers have disappeared one after another, namely Inspector Dong Pangen No. 7, ticket inspector Lu Guanghua No. 6, Lu Heshang No. 11, Song Baoshan No. 26, Huang Yuanji No. 6, ticket writer Lu Hongjin No. 27, Yue Guangfu No. 19, Ye Jingen No. 37, Xu Dehua No. 16, Guan Yukun No. 10, Liu Zhiren No. 5, driver Lu Bingqing No. 265, Yin Yaoting No. 223, He Haibo No. 17, Lu Yingsong No. 126, Zhu Ligong No. 354, ticket seller Xu Dasheng No. 149, and ticket inspector Feng Yimin No. 36.</p>
<h3>Rickshaws to Become a Public Utility: Patent Company Being Organized; Opinions Being Gathered</h3>
<p>Due to the soaring prices of rubber tires and other materials, the operating expenses of the rickshaw industry in Shanghai have increased daily. Rickshaw pullers have repeatedly requested the Public Works Department to increase rickshaw fares in order to maintain their business. However, in order to prevent the burden on citizens from becoming too heavy, the authorities only agreed to a moderate increase. Rickshaw owners believed that the profits were too small and expressed dissatisfaction. The industry association has repeatedly submitted documents to the authorities requesting assistance. Recently, in order to protect the interests of the industry, the authorities are considering organizing a patent company to control the city's rickshaw industry and grant the industry exclusive patent rights, stipulating legal dividends and bonuses for rickshaw owners. When expenses are insufficient, they can increase rickshaw fares at any time, similar to tram and bus companies. Currently, this proposal has been notified to the industry by the Public Works Department, and they have been instructed to express their opinions. According to news from the industry association, the association is now collecting written opinions from its members and will convene a meeting of its members in the near future. If the majority expresses their agreement, they will discuss the articles of association with the Public Works Department, sign a contract, and formally establish the company. According to rickshaw owners, the patent method is of great importance to the interests of rickshaw owners and is currently being carefully considered. However, most rickshaw owners believe that the profits currently obtained are extremely meager, so they generally welcome this method. There are no less than a thousand rickshaw owners in Shanghai, all of whom are operating freely. If the patent company is established, they will participate as shareholders. At that time, the rickshaw industry in Shanghai will also become a public transportation industry along with military vehicles and automobiles.</p>
<h3>The Panchen Lama Statue to Be Consecrated on a Set Date: October 19th</h3>
<p>Rongzeng Khenpo initiated the construction of a bronze statue of the Panchen Lama to allow people in Shanghai to worship it for a long time. He went north to supervise the casting on the Lantern Festival this year. Initially, only one statue was to be built, but then disciples who believed in Tibetan Buddhism in Beiping</p>
<p>Jointly Made a Great Vow</p>
<p>And also cast a statue for worship. Therefore, there is a statue of the Panchen Lama in both Beiping and Shanghai. On the day of the consecration of the Panchen Lama statue in Beiping, there was abundant rain and the ceremony was solemn. Han, Tibetan, Manchu, and Mongolian people all went</p>
<p>To Bow and Bless</p>
<p>Which was extremely grand at that time. In the middle of last month, the Panchen Lama statue was sent to Shanghai and temporarily placed in Rongzeng Lama's altar.

<h3>Shanghai Merchants Prepare to Transport Goods Via the Burma Road; Commercial Firms Prepare for Transportation; Dispatches to Ports in Vietnam and Hong Kong to Rush Delivery of Congested Inventory</h3>
<p>Since the British government officially announced the decision to open the Burma Road from the 18th of this month, foreign firms in Shanghai have expressed their joy upon hearing the news and are paying close attention to the situation of this international transportation line. British and American import and export firms have already begun preparations to transport goods from Shanghai to the southwest and to export goods from the mainland via this line. They have also telegraphed their branches in Kunming, Yangon, and Hong Kong to actively prepare so that freight can be restored from the 18th. They will also schedule ships to transport the imported goods of six or seven million yuan currently congested in Haiphong and Hong Kong to Yangon, and then import them via the Burma Road. In addition, American firms in Shanghai have ordered several batches of tungsten, lead, tin, and mineral products from the mainland, totaling more than a thousand tons. They have now also telegraphed to urge the export to the United States after the road is opened.</p>
<p>Post Office to Send Mail Via the Road</p>
<p>According to information obtained by a reporter from the Dagong News Agency yesterday from the Transportation Department of the Shanghai Postal Administration, after the resumption of shipping from Shanghai to the southwest, mail to the southwest from Shanghai was extremely slow due to the damage to the Dian-Vietnam Railway, which required barge transportation. Now that the Burma Road is scheduled to open on the 18th, mail from Shanghai to the mainland will be transported via this line, and the delivery speed can be increased. As for the more than 30,000 pieces of mail packages滞積滯積 in Haiphong and Hanoi, after negotiations with the Vietnamese government, a portion has been rushed out of Vietnam, and the rest can also be transported in succession.</p>
<p>The Road Bureau is Preparing for Traffic</p>
<p>The Burma Road starts from Kunming in Yunnan, passes through Xiaguan, Baoshan, Mangshi, and Wanding, enters Myanmar, and reaches Yangon. The entire journey is 1,146 kilometers, of which 959.4 kilometers are in China. There are reception centers and cafeterias along the way. The road management bureau has also dispatched a large number of vehicles to engage in passenger and freight transport.</p>
<p>China Completes New Transportation Lines</p>
<p>Since the closure of the Burma Road and the Dian-Vietnam Railway, the interests of foreign firms have been greatly damaged, especially the United States. Therefore, the reopening of this road is of great significance to promoting China's foreign trade. The Chinese government has actively rushed to build many new transportation lines, such as the China-Soviet, Dian, and Beijing lines, which have been completed and put into use one after another. The new Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Beijing, and Tibet provinces have established a post transportation organization and set up management offices. Therefore, after transportation has become more convenient, in addition to being self-sufficient, international import routes have also been smoothed, and the future of the war of resistance is more optimistic.</p>

<h3>Partner of Wu Feng Silk Company Accused of Speculation Failure; Zhongyong Foreign Firm Sues for Over 200,000 in Debt; Private Trading Firms Not Responsible; Court Adjourns for Deliberation and Sets Date for Pronouncement</h3>
<p>Li Xizhen, He Shoufan, Chen Zhenqing and others from Zhejiang jointly opened the Jiu Shuang Silk Firm at 75 Guangdong Road, with Chen Zhenqing as manager and He Shoufan as associate manager. Regarding the firm's business, Li Xizhen did not interfere and the responsibility rested entirely with Chen and He. In recent years, Chen and He, attracted by the potential profits of speculative ventures such as</p>
<p>buying and selling foreign exchange</p>
<p>, entrusted the Zhongyong Foreign Firm (a British firm) at 45 Jiujiang Road to trade in US dollars in the name of the Wu Feng Firm. They conducted a total of eighteen transactions in May and June of this year, totaling over US$120,000, equivalent to over 2.7 million legal currency. Chen and He's speculation failed this time, owing Zhongyong Foreign Firm 266,782.57 legal currency. The Wu Feng Firm's capital was only tens of thousands of dollars. Chen and He, unable to raise the</p>
<p>funds</p>
<p>, were recently sued in the First District Court's Civil Division by Zhongyong Foreign Firm, represented by lawyer Rong Zhenlong, who requested that Chen Zhenqing, He Shoufan, and Li Xizhen be jointly ordered to repay the debt of over 260,000. The case was heard yesterday by Judge Mo in the Second Civil Division. First, the plaintiff's representative lawyer, Rong Zhenlong, stated the purpose of the lawsuit. Then, the lawyer representing the defendants Chen Zhenqing and He Shoufan stated to the court that the defendants operated the Wu Feng Firm, purchasing goods worth about 30,000 yuan and selling about 40,000 yuan each month. The</p>
<p>business situation</p>
<p>was like this from January to June of this year, with records available for verification. As for the plaintiff's claim that the defendant owed the plaintiff over 260,000 yuan for buying and selling US dollars in May and June of this year, this was entirely speculative in nature and did not create a creditor-debtor relationship under the law. Therefore, the defendants should not be liable for repayment and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Later, Xu Wufang, the lawyer representing Li Xizhen, stated to the court that the defendants Chen Zhenqing and He Shoufan violated the principles of partnership. The Wu Feng Firm operated silk, but Chen and He actually engaged in</p>
<p>private speculation</p>
<p>. Even if there were debts, according to Article 679 of the Civil Code, the defendant Li Xizhen had no obligation for joint repayment and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The plaintiff insisted that the defendants Chen Zhenqing and others bought and sold actual US dollars, not empty transactions. Chen Zhenqing's representative lawyer said that the Wu Feng Firm had no need to buy actual US dollars, it was definitely speculative. After the court debated the arguments, it announced the conclusion of the trial and adjourned for judgment.</p>
<h3>Special Second Prison Paroles Criminals; Totaling 250</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Prison on Route Massenet in the French Concession was built with a limited area, so the capacity of the prison was set at no more than 1,600 inmates. However, since the "August 13th" Shanghai battle and the rising cost of living, the number of criminals has increased daily. By last year, the maximum number of inmates in the prison reached over 2,500, exceeding the original capacity by more than double. As the number of prisoners was high and funding was more difficult, the authorities submitted a request to the Ministry of Justice in February of this year, stating that during the extraordinary period, prisoners sentenced to imprisonment for no more than five years and those who were not repeat offenders should be granted special parole in order to alleviate overcrowding. So far, special parole has been held three times. Yesterday was the fourth batch of parole. A total of 150 inmates were paroled at that time.</p>

The general management office sent an accounting staff member yesterday morning at 11:35 AM, carrying 9,600 yuan in cash and 9,000 yuan in checks, traveling in the company's car number 10041 to the factory on Yichang Road. Unexpectedly, as the car passed near the intersection of Gordon Road and Route Mercier, four robbers lying in wait jumped out of the roadside, each wielding a pistol. They blocked the road, forced the car to stop, and robbed all the cash and checks, fleeing without a trace. Afterwards, the staff member reported the incident to the company and reported it to the Putuo Road police station, requesting an investigation.</p>

She was called to Huazi Police No. 1188 and Huazi detective Xu Dezhong arrived, took Zhou Jinrong into custody at the Chengdu Road police station, and sent him to the Criminal Second Division of the Special First Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a public prosecution according to Article 277 of the Criminal Law, stating that the defendant had previously beaten his father for no reason, and now he is beating his mother, which is absurd. He should be punished according to the law. Zhou Tangshi also complained about the circumstances of the attack and requested strict punishment. When questioned, the defendant pleaded guilty. Judge Zhong sentenced Zhou Jinrong to two months in prison for injuring a direct blood relative of an elder generation. He could commute the sentence to a fine of two yuan per day. The broken teapot was confiscated.</p>

<h3>Financial Affairs; Selling Wave Sweeps; US Dollar Once Reaches 6 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday saw HSBC's listed price unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American dollars became firmer, mainly due to reported political news from the Far East. Speculators tended to sell, releasing over one million US dollars. In addition, the Hong Kong Telegraph Company and Huahang also sought to sell about 500,000 yuan successively. Although HSBC absorbed them from time to time, the price rose sharply. Therefore, the market once loosened to 3 pence 84375 and 6 yuan 03125. The closing price was 3 pence 828125 and 6 yuan, resulting in an increase of 140625 and 28125 compared to the previous day. There is no market today due to National Day.</p>
<p>Huashang Sells More Than a Million</p>
<p>In the early morning, London large strips, US bank prices, and London gold prices were all stable. The exchange rate of British to US dollars against Shanghai was also flat. US dollars to British dollars increased by 25, while against Shanghai it was unchanged. The central government's listed prices for various exchanges remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 1875 and US dollars at 5 yuan 75. Compared to the previous close, British dollars eased by 03125, while US dollars were mixed. After opening, speculators and Huahang competed to sell, and the market hardened suddenly. They sold US dollars for October delivery to foreign banks such as HSBC, increasing from 5 yuan 75 to 9375. HSBC's listed prices were unchanged, and there was no increase or decrease in the white silver balance tax. Thereafter, foreign firms came to absorb, and the market stabilized slightly. They bought spot US dollars from foreign banks at 5 yuan 875 and 8125. At that time, a sudden sale from Hong Kong's telegraph company, totaling 4-500,000 US dollars, caused Huahang and speculators to want to sell again. They sold in competition, starting with only 10,000 yuan, and the market became increasingly hard. Huashang and the Hong Kong telegraph company sold spot US dollars to HSBC, McKelliget and others, from 5 yuan 8125 to 6 yuan 03125. At the same time, Huahang sold tens of thousands of pounds sterling to HSBC, also hardening to 3 pence 84375. At noon, the market stabilized slightly. The closing prices were British gold at 3 pence 828125, US dollars at 6 yuan, British gold for November delivery at 3 pence 8125, and US dollars at 5 yuan 96875. As a result, compared to the previous day, British dollars eased by 140625 and US dollars hardened by 28125 for current delivery. There is no market this afternoon due to Wednesday.</p>

<h3>Gold Plummets; Lowest at 5475 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market for cash gold fell again. This was influenced by reports of various unsettling developments, such as the official British announcement that Japan would reopen the Burma Road on the 18th, and the US State Department's warning to Americans to withdraw from the Far East. This led to a strong selling wave. Before the close, the lowest price reached 5,475 yuan. The closing price was only 5,505 yuan, a drop of 210 yuan compared to the previous day. Although it had recovered after the close, the unofficial market in the afternoon fell to as low as 5,4560 yuan.

The listed price for silver shop ornaments decreased by 30 yuan. Customs gold remained flat. Today is National Day, traditionally a market holiday.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Plunges by 210</p>
<p>In the early morning, the market was scattered. Because reports indicated unfavorable news and the exchange market eased, the market immediately dropped by 135 yuan. Gold shops and bullion houses sold dozens of taels, at 5,580 yuan. Then, money exchange firms suddenly absorbed to cover short positions, rising immediately to 5,610 yuan. Afterwards, due to selling pressure from cash shops and securities firms, it fell back to 5,580 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm suddenly reversed and absorbed, while silver shops also followed in buying, once rising back to 5,625 yuan. However, the exchange market became harder and it was difficult to sustain the high price. Cash shops and money exchange firms forcefully sold, causing a sudden drop of 7-80 yuan, retreating to 5,545 yuan. Then, silver shops also tended to sell, and there were even fewer buyers at one time, causing a plunge into the 5,500 yuan mark, reaching a low of 5,475 yuan. At the close, sellers decreased and the market recovered to close at 5,505 yuan. As a result, the market dropped by 210 yuan compared to the previous day. The market recovered to 5,530 yuan after the close, but weakened again in the afternoon, retreating back into the 5,500 yuan mark. The market fluctuated by 150 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the cash shops' own brand gold was more than ten yuan higher than cash gold, while the buying price was more than ten yuan lower. The current standard gold price was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Decreases for Three Consecutive Periods</p>
<p>The selling price of silver shop jewelry gold was reduced by 10 yuan per tael at 9:40, followed by another 10 yuan at 11:30, and another 10 yuan around 3 PM. As a result, Da Tong Hang changed to 560 yuan, and Xin Tong Hang had a similar price. The buying price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Plummet: US Dollar Notes Reach 16 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, due to the news of the US State Department's instruction for overseas Chinese in the Far East to evacuate, which was seen in the newspapers, people were in a state of panic, and various rumors arose as a result. Silver plummeted by more than 200 yuan. British and American gold pounds also plummeted by 5.5 yuan, and British gold notes fell sharply by 2.5 yuan. US dollar notes once fell to 16 yuan in the afternoon, eventually settling at 16.2 yuan, a sharp drop of 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes also fell by 1.5 jiao following the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. In addition, Singapore, Robbie, Canada, and Philippine notes also tended to decline. The supply of Japanese gold notes also surged, and the evening market retreated to 1.41 yuan. The trend of Korean notes was also soft, and the evening market retreated to 1.13 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Rice's Rise Was Fleeting</h3>
<p>Foreign rice in the early market was affected by the tense international news reported in the newspapers. Rumors abounded in the market, and speculative hoarding took the opportunity to spread rumors about the danger of rice transportation routes from Vietnam and the possible interruption of future sources. This led to floating households and blind followers vying to replenish their supplies. Therefore, although Shenji Foreign Firm continued to sell 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 2 rice at a price of only 76.2 yuan, and another telegram with a price of 75 yuan was sent, the market price of foreign rice was instead raised by more than 1 yuan. Soon, the exchange rate rose again, and foreign firms kept selling. There was talk that prices of 75 to 76 yuan had already been settled. In addition, due to recent orders of 200,000 to 300,000 bags, half of which were already on the way and would arrive soon, those who profited greatly took advantage of the high prices to sell. As a result, the midday market immediately fell back by nearly 1 yuan. Selling sentiment was very strong in the afternoon, and prices continued to fall. The result was actually slightly less than half a yuan lower than the previous day. Throughout the day, returned original unopened bags were traded, with spot transactions of more than 8,000 bags. In addition, due to the National Day holiday today, actual sales were also quite high.</p>
<p>Only a little over 100 shi of early and late rice of broken japonica arrived. However, the sales market was greatly constrained by the new japonica, resulting in flat selling prices, similar to before. Early Kaitam Port was 87 yuan, ordinary was 85 yuan, and the next grade was 77 yuan.</p>
<p>A total of 2,000 to 3,000 bags of new japonica pointed and kiln-grown rice arrived by both water and land transport. Although the arrival of goods was brisk, the outbound routes were smoother, so the arrival and sales were balanced. There was no change in the market. New Minhang japonica was 79 yuan, the next grade was 76 yuan, Xitang Rongzhong was 77 yuan, Taicang Yangjian was 64 to 62.3 yuan, and Qingjiao Dujian was 70 yuan, the next grade was 66 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to only scattered sales of domestic and foreign glutinous rice, it remained flat and unremarkable, with no fluctuations seen. The quoted price for Jinli special yuan was still 72 yuan, Changdan was 71 to 70 yuan, and foreign goods were the same.</p>
<h3>Flour: Desire to Hoard, But No Goods</h3>
<p>Flour continued to be firm yesterday. Transactions between local customers were not lively, mainly due to the limited supply from Chinese factories. Japanese flour was also banned from being transported to the concession areas. Other inland and foreign flour could only decorate the market. However, people believed that the rebound in rice prices and the news of the evacuation of American expatriates were beneficial, and speculators generally wanted to absorb supplies. The difficulty was the lack of chips, making it impossible to develop, because the Phoenix futures trading was suspended. It was heard that the price of slightly processed bottom flour "Red Peach Blossom" on this street was 15.23 yuan, and the price of foreign flour "Double Eagle" and "Fort Brand" was 18.56 yuan. The "Old Cart Depot" brand, which had once eased slightly the day before, rose again to 18.5 yuan yesterday, on par with the factory flour customer price.</p>
<p>Trading in wheat remained quiet yesterday. Japanese factories were indifferent to purchases, only handling a few hundred bags of goods delivered to the factory each day, and the price remained at 21.23 yuan. Chinese factories also found it difficult to relax their purchases, and few goods were transported into the concession areas. It was heard that the asking price for new wheat in nearby Taicang was 27 yuan, and the counter-offer was 26 yuan, but no transactions had been made. It was also heard that this street handled 10 bags of barley transported from Pudong at a price of 23 yuan for medicinal purposes.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Returns Slightly</h3>
<p>The securities gray market was very strong when it first opened yesterday, but it turned down due to a surge of selling after people began buying. Yesterday, excluding the winning bids for Category C shares, the opening bid for Hongtian Xinchang was once raised to 8.45 yuan. Afterwards, Lianyi and retail investors sold more, and the price broke through 8 yuan again, falling to 7.3 yuan. Subsequently, Runli, Yongkang, and Tongkang bought in successively, and the price rebounded firmly. The market was closed in the afternoon to handle same-day settlement, as today is National Day and a holiday. The resulting market prices all rebounded by a slight 0.35 to 0.6 yuan. The total value of transactions was approximately 800,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Tianchu MSG Factory were traded at a price of 87 yuan.</p>
<p>The market prices of London foreign debts remained unchanged, while the market prices of Shanghai foreign stocks fluctuated greatly. See the market price column for details.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Raw Oil Enters and Exits Briskly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 7,210 pieces of raw oil and 300 bags of soybeans were transported from Qingdao. There were also 500 bags of soybeans transported to Singapore. Today, 700 bags of soybeans will be transported to Xiamen, 1,380 cans of raw oil will be transported to Xiamen, and 500 pieces will be transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New York Silk Market Speculates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, silk prices in the US and Japan rose significantly, especially in New York. As the situation in the Pacific became increasingly tense, the US authorities had indicated that they might ban silk imports, so speculation on the New York Stock Exchange surged. The prices of near and far-term futures of standard silk rose by about 1 jiao. Spot Japanese silk rose by 0.04 to 0.06 yuan, Shanghai silk rose by 0.04 yuan, and Guangdong silk rose by 0.02 yuan.</p>
<p>Spot prices in Yokohama rose by 20 yuan, and forward prices rose by 1 yuan. Silk prices in this port also rebounded upward. White factory 7-8-point silk was sold for 5,100 yuan, but there were few goods on hand.</p>
<h3>Japanese Silk Production Significantly Reduced</h3>
<p>This year's Japanese silk production is far less than in the past. According to the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, this year it was possible to harvest 51,010,000 guan of cocoons, but in fact only 39,962,320 guan were harvested, a decrease of 20%, making it one of the worst years for Japanese cocoon harvests in the past five years. Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, it has greatly affected the labor force in Japanese rural areas. In addition, this year was affected by unfavorable weather, resulting in a sharp reduction in cocoon production. (According to last year's Japanese cocoon production of 44,776,593 guan, 1938 cocoon production of 40,863,284 guan, 1937 cocoon production of 45,503,284 guan, 1936 cocoon production of 41,392,474 guan, 1935 cocoon production of 44,175,526 guan, this year's cocoon production is one of the lowest years).</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Shipped to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's cloth market saw continued easing of foreign exchange rates, and hoarders were anxious. Goods were sold off again according to the market. However, the demand for various goods was continuously absorbed by buyers, and the situation remained very stable. Selling prices fluctuated very little. Fine yarn and thread-woven products, such as serge and thread tweed, saw selling prices increase by 0.15 to 0.3 yuan per piece due to expensive raw materials. More than 500 pieces of various goods were traded on this street, more than 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill coarse cloth were traded by the Guangdong-Hong Kong group, more than 100 pieces of coarse cloth and colored cloth were traded by the Zhejiang-Anhui group, and more than 100 pieces of flannel, blue cloth, and coarse cloth were traded by the North Road Yanjin group.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Due to the decline in yarn prices, transactions were thin, and the range of price fluctuations was also small. The closing price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 36.35 yuan, and the price of Four Gentlemen serge was 1.085 yuan per yard. The price of mid-range fine cloth remained stable, with no significant fluctuations.</p>
<p>Exports: Yesterday, 40 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Singapore, and 720 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. Today, another 1,550 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 115 pieces will be shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>"Hug Berlin" Sells Well</h3>
<p>"Hug Berlin" occupies a considerable position in today's raincoat materials. Western-style raincoats are popular because they are light, comfortable, and the gray-yellow color is more lively than navy blue. Original colors are extremely rare. Imported goods are wholesaled at 2.2 yuan per yard, but ordinary people are mostly unable to afford them, leading to the rise of domestically produced "Hug Berlin." There is a considerable demand from the Hong Kong-Guangdong group. According to estimates, 80% to 90% of raincoats are made in Shanghai and then shipped to Hong Kong. Yesterday, Xiang Sheng, Xinchang, and other households opened more than 2,000 yards of Rentai, Ape-Man, and Taishan Drag Berlin raincoats, and the transaction price was 3.25 yuan net. It is found that the width of domestic "Hug Berlin" is only 30 inches, and 5.5 yards of material are required to make a piece. The labor cost is estimated to be about 4 yuan per piece, and ordinary stores in Shanghai sell each piece for 22 to 23 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, with the continuous easing of foreign exchange rates, the decline in the sugar market became even more severe. The association's price fixing: the spot price of 24 coarse white sugar was originally 75.5 yuan, a drop of 2 yuan, and foreign sugar was 75 yuan, a drop of 1.5 yuan. The decline in transit goods was the same, at 58.5 to 59 yuan. Dutch cotton white fell by about 1 yuan, BM was 72.8 yuan, and Dutch red fell by about 0.9 yuan. The spot price was 56 to 55.9 yuan, the road price was 50.6 yuan, Taikoo Car White B was 73.4 yuan, and DY was 71.4 yuan, both down 0.6 yuan. HY was 71.4 to 71 yuan, down 1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hongji Coal Added 4 Yuan</h3>
<p>After a large batch of new Hongji white coal powder arrived at the port recently (as reported in previous newspapers), people's minds were settled and the market atmosphere turned stable. Naturally, the cost was reduced as foreign exchange rates rose. Unexpectedly, a certain firm opened the market yesterday, and its peers cut prices, uniformly increasing the price by 4 yuan. It is estimated that the price of Hongji No. 2 powder (coal briquette raw material) is 124 yuan per ton, self-delivery from the warehouse, with handling fees added. The abnormal action was truly unexpected.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Why Did Cotton Yarn Skyrocket? Kicking Back and Forth, it's Still Mostly Paper Trading. Closing In and Out, the Actual Destination is Still Flat. If You Want to Get Out in the Future, I'm Afraid it Will Be Difficult to Reach the Sky.</h3>
<p>The reason why the price of cotton yarn has risen by 1,200 yuan outside the customs this time is unusually enthusiastic. The reasons for this can be briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Shanghai financial community, in view of the abundance of floating funds, implemented interest rate cuts.</p>
<p>(2) The Burma blockade line will be opened soon and trade will resume.</p>
<p>(3) Although this year's new cotton harvest has been announced, the source is controlled by a certain party and is blocked.</p>
<p>(4) A certain exchange, which has been rumored for a long time, officially announced its establishment on October 1 and will officially open for business. The general speculative community has been idle for a long time and has no way to operate. It uses this topic to greatly exert its skills of stirring up trouble. The fundamental problem is still that the exchange began to finalize the price. The general sellers searched for Japanese yarn and absorbed a batch of it for use as chips, so that the market can enter and exit, and transactions can be circulated. As a result, the root is tightened. The two brands of "20-count Blue Phoenix Yueqin" rose first, and people's hearts were agitated. The Tianjin gang and the Securities Gold gang were all ready to move. Everyone dragged and pulled each other, and they all rushed in. In this situation, the chips were naturally insufficient for distribution for a while. On Friday and Saturday, a certain institute announced two limit-up days. As a result, the speculative community was very happy, and "the bulls all hoped that the sky would fall." As for the actual transaction, it has shown signs of decline. Each day, each market except for the Hong Kong comprador buys 500 to 600 packages, at most 1,000 packages. It is found that the total transaction in the past week was 26,890 packages, of which the Hong Kong gang bought only 4,470 packages. The so-called peer-to-peer transaction, the paper ball is kicked back and forth, and the transaction is 22,390 packages. Reviewing the number of transactions per day increased from 2,000 packages to 4,000 packages. The paper ball transaction today is actually more than 5,400 packages. It is conceivable that the recent speculation has been fierce. Unexpectedly, the good times did not last long. Yesterday, the rising peak was seen again at 1,217 yuan. International news was unfavorable, foreign exchange rates were long and long, the basis of the legal currency was more solid, gold fell sharply, and foreign merchants' stocks fell miserably. At this time, the bull front showed a significant shaking trend, so it fell to 1,165 yuan in an instant, but the public psychology, the amount of absorption, is still unwilling to give up, but the inventory is still outside 300,000 packages. At present, the outlets of all parties are narrow and difficult. As for the increasing lag in the need for cotton cloth, the small-scale cloth factories in this port still lack a way to survive, and those who have stopped have still not been able to resume work. Now 1,200 yuan, compared with 800 yuan for the secondary price of 20-count Shuangma on June 28, when the Vietnam issue was tense, has risen by 400 yuan, an increase of 50%. It is found that the exchange rate of US dollars has been reduced to 5.09375 yuan, and yesterday's price was 5.65625 yuan. Based on the above situation, the upper-end price of cotton yarn can be said to have reached its end. However, the general public is still very excited, and the market discussion is unanimously optimistic. At present, the chips are being held by everyone, and the cracks are not likely to be realized, so they will never be willing to rein in on the edge of the cliff, and the international situation is unpredictable. If you want to get out in the future, I am afraid it will be difficult to reach the sky. (Shan)</p>
<h3>The Environment Deteriorates Daily: Yarn Prices Fall</h3>
<p>The yarn market began to rise and then fell, but the trend has entered a state of confusion. The truth is that the situation is tense and the foreign exchange rate is long and long, so although the bulls are determined to be optimistic, the environment does not allow it. As a result, the public's mind is weak, and the buying front is not as stable as the previous day. However, the paper ball transaction in the market is increasing day by day, and each day it ends up being more than 4,000 to 5,000 packages. It is conceivable that the scope of future changes will be expanded. Yesterday, there were 780 pieces of yarn shipped to Hong Kong, and today there were 60 pieces shipped to Xiamen and 1,825 pieces shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The spot yarn opened in the morning. Because the bulls spread the air the day before, they shouted to raise the price in unison. The first market rose to 1,200 yuan. At this time, the buying sentiment was still strong. In an instant, it was heard that the news was unfavorable to the bulls, and the foreign exchange rate was long and long. Gold fell sharply, and the selling sentiment suddenly became fierce, falling to 1,163 yuan. However, the bulls came again to raise the price, and the military rose to 1,182 yuan, but the eating households were not prosperous, and they softened again. The closing price was 1,179 yuan. After the closing, the price could not be sold for 20 yuan due to bad news. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 6,203 packages. The market fell by 20 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Peers: 5,400 Fuzhou: 3</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 800 Statistics: 6,203 packages</p>
<h3>Factories Are Watching: Only Peers Are Optimistic About Cotton</h3>
<p>Spot cotton trading is slightly more prosperous, but the factories rarely move. The peers are optimistic because the source is not accessible. However, the foreign exchange rate is strangely long and the gold price has fallen miserably, allowing the cotton market to be in a difficult situation. Today, there are 355 pieces of cotton shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Brazil 280.00 Da Xin entered 150 pieces</p>
<p>Also 277.00 Qingtai entered 100 pieces</p>
<p>Aumla 202.00 Sentai entered 100 pieces</p>
<p>Mitlin 292.00 Yuan Xingde entered 100 pieces</p>
<p>Bailuo went to 236.00 Changxing entered 100 pieces</p>
<p>Pingguoer 157.00 Tao Dingji entered 100 pieces</p>
<p>Dazhongji 257.00 Renchang entered 100 pieces</p>
<p>The following supplements the previous day</p>
<p>Bailuo went to 32.00 Shenjiu entered 400 pieces</p>
<p>Pingguoer 16 .00 Yuda entered 100 pieces</p>
<p>Another message: the foreign cotton market price. The New York cotton market was quiet, because the weak Chinese business street and a part of the reactionaries sold out. As a result, the closing price fell by 3 to 5 pounds compared with the previous day. India together with the forecast, fell by 5 Robi yesterday.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton transaction in Shanghai Port was quieter yesterday. Because the situation in the Far East turned serious, all parties adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Although there were not many transactions yesterday, it was because the inventory in Shanghai was not abundant, so the selling price still failed to turn loose. In general, the opinions are that after the market has a slight turnaround, the cotton market will rise.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Ship Steel Plates Tighten</h3>
<p>Especially Thick Colorful Ones are Popular</p>
<p>Ship steel plates have become fragmented after the relocation of shipyard manufacturers. Recently, the northern gang has been searching for them from time to time. In addition, this street is very interested in thick colorful ones, and the market atmosphere has been invigorated. People's minds have become lively. The standard is that the price has risen without falling compared to the previous market (thick colorful ones are especially the case). At present, the market selling price is 2.5 li, shouting 80 yuan, 0.5 fen sells for 70 yuan, 7 li sells for 67 yuan, and 1 fen also needs 65 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the previously published "1 fen colorful sells for 50 yuan" actually sells for 60 yuan per dan. This is an error in the report at the time. This is a correction.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Western Sea Cucumber Arrives and Sells Not Quietly</h3>
<p>Western sea cucumber has recently arrived and sold quietly. Another deal was sold yesterday, including 621 yuan for selected Wangjiaxi jade ginseng, 578 yuan for No. 1 jade, 528 yuan for No. 2 jade, 468 yuan for No. 3 jade, 405 yuan for No. 4, 355 yuan for No. 5, 251 yuan for small jade, 256 yuan for selected red ginseng, 222 yuan for No. 1 red, 193 yuan for No. 2 red, 173 yuan for No. 3, 156 yuan for No. 4, and 148 yuan for small red ginseng. The transaction price is slightly firmer than before.</p>
<h3>Siamese Mussels 6-7 Yuan</h3>
<p>Siamese dried mussels have recently arrived in a batch, with all colors available, and the sales are quite good. At present, large and medium dried mussels sell for 207 yuan, large dried mussels sell for 212 yuan, and outgoing office sells for 228 yuan, an increase of 6-7 yuan compared to before.</p>
<h3>Seaweed Market Scarce</h3>
<p>The seaweed market is thin, and it seems that demand exceeds supply. The market price has increased by 10%. At present, Longya seaweed sells for 55 yuan, Xilan seaweed sells for 58 yuan, Wudun seaweed sells for 52 yuan, and the goods are very scarce. Lion mane seaweed sells for 64 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Post-War Chinese Silk Industry (Continued from the Fourth Day)</h3>
<p>— Shi Xiang</p>
<p>There are still small factories that take the risk of extending credit. Their capital is inherently limited. With 60,000 yuan as working capital, they can at most purchase only one hundred fifty or sixty dan of fresh cocoons at market price, equivalent to about fifty-odd dan of dried cocoons. However, some take the risk of purchasing goods exceeding their original capital by one time. Although they purchase three hundred dan of fresh cocoons, they incur an additional debt of 60,000 yuan. Villagers demand payment of old debts as soon as the cocoon collection ends. Manufacturers are unable to make ends meet, resulting in goods being seized and prohibited from leaving the country. Consequently, disputes arise one after another. With no way out, manufacturers resort to high-interest loans (interest rates for borrowing against silk cocoons in Wuxi have reached as high as five percent per month) while selling goods at low prices to settle foreign debts, bringing money back to their hometowns to compensate and immediately prepare for production. It is thus evident how difficult it is to transport small batches of dried cocoons to factories and, after exchanging the raw silk produced for funds, returning to the villages to redeem cocoons and continue operations.</p>

The first-place winner in the university group is Su Yi-Huan from Southwest Associated University in Kunming, whose essay is entitled "A Record of Hydrological Surveying in Tengchong." The second-place winner is Zhou Zhi-Nan from Chongqing University. Both winners have been requested to send in their recent photographs for printing and publication. The first-place winner in the middle school group is Guo Dong-Cai from McTyeire School, whose essay is entitled "Our Summer School." The second-place winner is Yun Guan-Hua from the attached middle school of Guanghua University. Photographs of the two middle school winners will be published today. All the awarded prizes will be sent to the schools by mail (for those outside the city) or delivered by representatives of this newspaper before October 20 (for those within the city). The free subscriptions to the Shen Bao newspaper will be sent or delivered from October 21. Furthermore, this newspaper has decided to present the Southwest Associated University and McTyeire School, the schools of the first-place winners, with plaques inscribed with "Nurturing Upright Individuals" and "Profound Educational Achievement," respectively, to express recognition and as a memento. In view of the excellent results of this contest, this newspaper hopes to continue to hold such contests in the future, expanding the scope and soliciting contributions more widely, so that students across the country can make good use of their valuable time, strive for academic excellence, and participate wholeheartedly.

<h3>Charity Basketball Challenge Match Fifth Battle: Qun Yi Team Takes on Paramount: Still Held at the China Youth Association This Saturday Evening; Women's Exhibition Match: Shanghai Stars vs. You You</h3>
<p>The Charity Basketball Challenge Match has been successful and exceeded expectations since it began. The fifth match is scheduled to be held this Saturday (12th) at the China Youth Association on Eight Immortals Bridge. The team taking on the challenge is the Qun Yi team, known for its 牛皮糖 (niú pí táng, a type of chewy candy), the former 叙芳 (Xù Fāng) team. Before the match, there will be a women's exhibition match between the Shanghai Stars and the You You team. Tickets are still sold as 5 yuan honorary tickets and 2 yuan ordinary tickets. Presale tickets begin today. Despite the increased prices, the audience remains crowded. The Qun Yi team, the former 叙芳 (Xù Fāng) team, plays a very aggressive style. In the Association Cup, they posed a great threat to Paramount. In the second round, Qun Yi lost to Paramount by only one point. This time, in addition to their original team, they have also invited Xu Ju-Sheng, the famous bomber (i.e., Qi Fan), Qiu Guang-Xie, a national games star, and Guo Zhi-Hong, a key player from the Shanghai Stars, to assist. Their strength has visibly increased, and their lineup is more disciplined. Therefore, this Saturday's battle is sure to be very exciting. The organizing committee, in order to make the fifth match more lively, has dispatched Pan Hong-Ding, the director-general of the Orphanage and Training Institute, and Cheng Zhi-Liang, the director of the Production Department, to visit Mr. Zhou Jun-Xian, who bid 1,000 yuan the night before, to urge him to participate in this Saturday's auction, in order to clearly obtain more funds for charity.</p>

<p>Silver Coin Ping-Pong Exhibition Match: Citibank Forcefully Defeats YWCA. To spark interest in ping-pong among the silver coin industry, a special exhibition match was added the night before last during the Silver Coin Cup ping-pong competition. The YWCA ping-pong team faced off against last year's runner-up, Citibank, at the Citibank Club. The YWCA team was coached by veteran ping-pong player Chen Linsheng, and their techniques were extraordinary. Citibank is a strong force in the banking world, with substantial strength. The event attracted a lot of wonderful attention. In the second match, YWCA team captain Zhang Yongru fought hard against Citibank's Western star player, Olyler. The two battled for five sets.

<h3>Shanghai Youth vs. Shanghai Star: Finals Today. Guangshi Basketball League, Division A: Women's Division: Zhizhong vs. Shanghai Star</h3>
<p>The second Guangshi Cup basketball tournament is nearing its final stages in all divisions. In Division A, the perennial winners Shanghai Youth and Shanghai Star A teams are scheduled to meet this afternoon to compete for the division championship. Shanghai Youth is the runner-up of the United Cup, boasting famous players like "Big Cat" Sun Huipei, Yu Xuanqian, Li Zude, Ren Xiangcheng, Tao Shaosheng, and others. Besides veterans Liang Yunming, Chen Bangzhen, and Zhuo Guorong, Zheng Qinming of Shanghai Star A is also an outstanding talent at the front. At the time of the game, it is expected that the contest will be fierce and full of excitement. In the women's division, originally, there were two matches: the Jingwu versus Qixiu match. Both teams agreed to reschedule; therefore, only the first-round match of Zhizhong versus Shanghai Star remains. The West team previously met in the China Youth charity basketball exhibition match, and Zhizhong suffered a crushing defeat. Today, they meet again on a narrow path; it is uncertain who will be victorious. In Division B, two matches, Guangshi versus Shanghai Star B, and Flying Eagle versus Lianyi, are at critical junctures. It is predicted that Guangshi and Lianyi will be victorious, and the above two teams will compete for the championship. In addition, there are six matches in Division B. If Lingyou wins against Laoyi, they will win the "Guang" group championship. Green Duckweed has won all four matches in the "Zhong" group. If they can overcome Guoguang C today, they will also win the top spot in the group. The remaining few matches are insignificant to the overall standings. Tickets are sold for one yuan each.

<h3>Hong Kong Football League Opens: South China Suffers Defeat</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Dispatch) This year's football league opened yesterday. Originally, there were three Division A matches, but two were postponed. Only one match remained, Fuhua versus Scott, held at the So Kon Po Stadium. This year, with the rise of the Sing Tao team, South China, which has dominated Hong Kong for four years, has suffered a significant blow to its strength. However, with the "Football King" Li Huitang and famous winger Cao Guicheng wearing their uniforms, and the assistance of young new talents, the lineup is still considered complete. In yesterday's first match against the Scottish army, the offensive was very strong. The "Football King" had more than ten opportunities to shoot, but unfortunately, due to bad luck, he was unable to succeed. In the end, they lost to Scott by a score of 0 to 1, which is a great pity. South China's starting lineup is as follows:</p>
<h3>China Sports Referees Association: Le Xiurong Appointed President</h3>

<p>Surveying the Dieshuihe Waterfall: Completing the Survey Work</p>
<p>This spring, gentry in Tengchong wished to utilize the Dieshuihe Waterfall in the county to construct a hydroelectric power plant. They suggested this to the Yunnan Provincial Economic Commission, which praised their request and hired Shi Jiayang, Dean of the Engineering College of National Southwest Associated University and chief engineer of the Yunnan Provincial Hydropower Survey Team of the Resources Committee, to preside over the matter. By July, when school was on summer vacation, Mr. Shi sent me and classmates Chen Qiheng and Liao Zhongzhou to investigate the hydropower situation of Dieshuihe and measure the detailed conditions on both banks, to serve as a basis for designing the plant and canals. Thus, we had a trip to Tengchong.</p>
<p>Staying in Xiaguan for a Month: Surveying the Hydropower of the Er River</p>
<p>We departed from Kunming on June 28th on a bus of the Yunnan-Burma Highway Bureau. Due to vehicle obstructions, we were delayed on the road for a day and only arrived in Xiaguan on the evening of the 30th. We stayed at the Yunnan-Burma Highway Bureau Hostel. Taking the opportunity to survey the hydropower situation in the Er River area, we stayed in Xiaguan for over a month.</p>
<p>The Er River (Figure 1) is the outlet of Er Lake. It flows through Xiaguan to Yangbi (Figure 2) and merges with the Yangbi River, flowing into the Lancang River. At the Black Dragon Bridge in Xiaguan, the river surface is 80 meters wide and the water is about 1 meter deep on average. From the measurements taken on July 15th of this year, the flow rate during the high-water period is known to be 40 O.M.S. (cubic meters per second). From the Black Dragon Bridge, the current begins to accelerate 500 meters to the west, and the riverbed gradually narrows to only 30 meters, with a slope of about 0.7%. Another 2 kilometers to the Tianban Bridge, the river passes through deep valleys between two mountains, a very dangerous situation. It is said that when Zhuge Wuhou of the Han Dynasty conquered the southern barbarians, he captured the barbarian king Meng Huo here four times. This is the lowest gap in Cangshan Mountain, and southwest air currents often blow into the Dali Plain from here, causing Xiaguan to be windy. The narrowest part of the valley is only 3 meters wide, and there are large protruding rocks on both banks that connect like a bridge, which people can cross over, hence the name Tiansheng Bridge (Natural Bridge). (Figure 3) The river flows through the deep valley under the bridge. At first, it was thought that the water flow must be extremely turbulent in such a narrow valley, but it turned out that the flow was slower than the upstream and downstream, at 1.5m/sec. It can be imagined that there must be a deep abyss at the bottom of the river, and there must be larger gaps under the stone cliffs on both banks. Another 300 meters ahead, huge rocks protrude in the water, causing the water to tumble and leap, and the foam rises like snowflakes. The river water in front of the rocks falls deeply to 8 or 9 meters, which is quite spectacular from a distance. The locals call it Bu Xie Mei (Never Thank the Plum Blossom), because it has white flowers all year round. People think that it is a waterfall, and its hydropower must be great. A previous association hired personnel from Siemens to investigate and planned to generate electricity, but the project did not materialize due to lack of funds. Recently, the Resources Committee plans to build a small power plant there to supply electricity to Dali, Xiaguan, Fengyi, and Yangbi. The detailed topographic map of the area near the planned power plant has been measured by us. The local people are eagerly awaiting the construction of the hydropower plant, which will begin soon.</p>
<p>Descending 3 kilometers from Tiansheng Bridge, the water flows entirely between the stone beds at the bottom of the valley. Downstream, the rocks are jagged and undulating, and the rushing water creates waves that gleam and reflect. The smooth places are pools of clear water, which is very refreshing. The riverbed is winding and extends to the southwest. The water surface is between 20 and 40 meters wide, and the slope is over 2%. The walls on both sides of the river are mostly steep, but the gradient is uniform, and there is very little flat land. The mountains are undulating, and the trees are lush. There are occasional county springs and waterfalls, with flying rapids echoing through the valleys, making the scenery very beautiful. The Yunnan-Burma Highway is 30 meters above the water on the right bank. On the left bank, there is an old post road, and the sound of bells can still be heard from time to time. The geology along the river consists of purple mud cliffs on the left bank and granite on the right bank. The stones are huge, with fine textures and solid quality. The arch bridges, culverts, and nearby village buildings now use stone materials extracted locally, which is very convenient. Tracing the river downstream for another 10 kilometers to the iron chain bridge, commonly known as the 40-Li Bridge, 40 Chinese miles west of Yangbi. It is also known as the Chain Bridge, which uses eight iron chains to connect both banks, covered with wooden planks, for people and horses to cross. The bridge is 18 meters long and 3.6 meters wide. The water surface height under the bridge is 1570 meters, 400 meters lower than the water surface in Xiaguan. Another 6 kilometers ahead to Pingpo, the Er River merges with the Yangbi River and flows into the Lancang River (Figure 4). The width at the confluence is 20 meters, the average water depth is 1 meter, and the water surface elevation is 1380 meters, which is 600 meters lower than the water surface in Xiaguan. The horizontal distance between the two places is 21.5 kilometers, so the total average water surface slope is 3.0%. The abundance of hydropower resources is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Ten Days of Travel in Baoshan: Visiting the Martial Marquis Shrine</p>
<p>By July 18th, we had completed all the work in Xiaguan. Coincidentally, a classmate, Mr. Zhang, who served in the Red Cross Medical Transportation Team, came to the hostel and said that several transportation vehicles would be going to Baoshan empty. Therefore, we carried our instruments and luggage and continued westward. We passed Yongping that night and arrived in Baoshan City on the afternoon of the 30th, staying at the Highway Bureau Hostel. The hostel was commissioned by the Yunnan-Burma Highway Bureau to be run by the China Travel Service. It is located on Taibao Mountain north of the city (Figure 5), the former site of the Jade Emperor Pavilion. The scenery is beautiful, and the trees are lush. There is the Cuiwei Building, from which one can overlook the Baoshan Plain, one of the eighteen scenic spots of Baoshan. Therefore, ancient people often held banquets there. The hostel is still used as a restaurant. Among all the Yunnan-Burma Highway hostels, this one should have the best scenery.</p>
<p>We stayed in Baoshan for ten days, taking advantage of our leisure time to travel around the scenic spots and schools. We climbed Taibao Mountain, visited the Martial Marquis Shrine, crossed Wolongquan Bridge, visited Yi Zachi, tasted Yongzhu Spring, walked Lihua Pavilion, visited Shihua Cave, and visited the Tengxian Guild Hall (Figure 6). We received cordial hospitality from the local people and were able to visit the National Overseas Chinese Middle School, the Provincial Baoshan Normal School, and various county-run primary and secondary schools, witnessing the increasing progress of education in the border area, which was truly inspiring. The beautiful scenery was pleasing to the eye, broadening our minds.</p>
<p>Following the Ancient Tengchong-Baoshan Road: A Long March on Sedan Chairs</p>
<p>There is still no car access from Baoshan west to Tengchong. When the Yunnan-Burma Highway was being built, there were two original plans west of Baoshan: the southern line and the northern line. The southern line went southwest from Baoshan, through Longling, Mangshi, Zhafang, and Wanmading to enter Burma and connect to Lashio. The northern line went west from Baoshan, following the ancient Tengchong-Baoshan road to reach Tengchong, through Lianshan to connect to Bhamo in Burmese territory. In terms of climate and business, this line was better. However, at that time, the Mangshi and Zhafang areas along the southern line already had a section of road built by the local chieftain. In order to save money, the authorities decided to use that road and adopted the southern line plan. The people of Tengchong had strongly argued for this, but to no avail. It has recently been heard that gentry in Tengchong, in order to facilitate transportation as a key plan to develop all industries, and to connect the border areas as a priority for strengthening national defense, have agreed with the people of Baoshan to raise funds autonomously from the people of the two counties to build the Tengchong-Baoshan Highway. The project is said to have started several months ago and has made great progress. Recently, due to the busy farming season and the rainy season, work has been temporarily suspended. It is expected that work will continue around the Mid-Autumn Festival in August. If no special difficulties arise, the thoroughfare will be opened in a year. Not only will business between Tengchong and Baoshan become more prosperous, but people from other places who come to visit Tengchong will no longer have to travel arduously for days.</p>
<p>Based on the above, this time we went from Baoshan to Tengchong by taking a sedan chair and following the ancient Tengchong-Baoshan road to the west. Both Tengchong and Baoshan are remote areas on the border of our country. The Nujiang and Gaoligong Mountains span between them, dividing the watersheds of the Lujiang and Longchuan Rivers. The terrain is dangerous, and the trails twist up and down through high mountains, deep valleys, dense forests, and open spaces, making the journey extremely difficult. I measured from the map that the straight-line distance between the two counties is only 150 li, but the actual distance traveled is more than 300 li. The tortuous situation can be imagined. It takes four days to travel from Baoshan to Tengchong by sedan chair. On the first day, we traveled 70 li, had lunch at Lengshuiqing, and stayed overnight in Qing Biao Yi. On the second day, we traveled 90 li, crossed the Nujiang River, passed the Lujiang River, and stayed overnight in the old village of Gaoligong Mountain. This day was the longest and most difficult of the entire journey. On the third morning, we departed from the old village, had lunch at Pinghe Village on the top of Gaoligong Mountain, crossed the Longchuan River, and climbed uphill for another 10 li to reach Olive Village, where we stayed overnight. The journey was 80 li, and the hardship of the journey was only slightly less than on the second day. On the fourth day, we continued to climb uphill from Olive Village, had lunch at Qincaifeng, and from there, the road was relatively flat. After crossing another small slope, the Tengchong Plain was in sight. We reached the county seat at 3:00 PM. The arduous journey came to an end here. This is a general overview of the journey. As for the sights, sounds, and lodging conditions along the way, they will be described below.</p>
<p>Continued on page 18</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>We left Baoshan on August 8th. The sedan chair we took was hired from the city the day before. Because there were too many luggage and instruments, we hired four porters and six chair carriers, for a total of ten people. The wage for each person was negotiated to be 50 new Yunnan dollars, equivalent to 25 national dollars. They were all from Sichuan. When they first came to the hostel with the sedan chair, they looked haggard and their faces were dark. I was worried that they would not be able to bear the arduous journey. When I saw them packing their luggage and pushing each other, even a shoe or a hat was thrown onto someone else's burden, their behavior was despicable and disgusting. Later, they told me that they were all subordinates of Guo Runao of the Sichuan Army. In the 25th year of the Republic, they followed the army to Yunnan to suppress bandits and were dismissed in the north of Shuichang. They were stranded in a foreign land and could not return, so they had to sell their labor to make a living.</p>
<p>They were also addicted to opium. Each person had a small cloth bag containing opium pipes and lamps. Whenever they reached a place while walking, they would find a place to lie down and enjoy the pleasure of smoking, completely disregarding the luggage of the travelers. They would not start until repeatedly urged. I had previously read Mrs. Eberhardt's book "The Traffic of the Middle Kingdom", which stated that Chinese sedan chair carriers need to smoke opium every two or three hours. I thought it was an exaggeration by foreigners. Unexpectedly, I witnessed this scene today, and I realized that Mrs. Eberhardt's words were all based on facts. Although the authorities have set a time limit for prohibition and strictly enforce it, it is still unknown whether these people can wake up and break away from the darkness.</p>
<p>Visiting Xu Xiake's Travel Traces: Lodging in Pu Biao Yi That Night</p>
<p>We got up at 6:00 AM on August 8th. The hired sedan chair carriers and servants were supposed to come at 7:00 AM, but they did not arrive until after 8:00 AM. It took another hour to pack the luggage, so we were not able to start until 9:30 AM. After leaving the city through Zhennan Gate, we walked west along the Yunnan-Burma Highway for 6 kilometers and then took the ancient Tengchong-Baoshan road. At that time, it was cloudy and foggy, and it was drizzling. At 10:00 AM, we passed Zhuge Weir. The weir was on the right side of the road, with a ten-li-long grass embankment made of stone blocks. It is said that it was built by Zhuge during his southern campaign to garrison troops. To the right is Jiulonggang, named because the mountain range undulates into nine peaks. The peaks are continuous, and the trees are beautiful, making for excellent scenery. Between the weir and the mountain, there is a flat field. When there is a lot of rain, it is stored here to form a lake, which the locals call Dahaizi. Above the hillside, houses are lined up, and where smoke rises, it is Dayu Village. Half an hour later, we passed the 25-Li Post. The sedan chair carriers asked for a break, so we got out of the sedan chair and rested for half an hour before continuing. Ten minutes later, we passed Xiyoushan Shihua Cave. Teachers and staff from the Overseas Chinese Middle School invited us to play in the cave. The cave is located on the right side of the road, under the mountain, also called Banana Cave. The entrance of the cave has a wooden gate, and Guanyin Bodhisattva is enshrined inside, with a monk guarding it. That day, we held torches, pine oil, and flashlights to enter the cave. At the right turn of the entrance, there is a bat nest on the top of the cave. The bats, seeing the light, flew away in droves, chirping loudly, countless in number, which was quite frightening. There are many forks in the cave, and it is slippery and difficult to walk. Although we hired a local guide, we did not dare to go deep. We walked about a mile and returned, and we were unable to explore it completely. There are many stalactites in the cave, with strange shapes, like umbrellas, cows, tigers, and leopards, as if they were sculptures. The stone walls are shimmering and glittering, and when touched by hand, it feels cool to the bone. At one place, the guide struck the ground heavily with a large stone, and a sound like thunder rose, deafening. The locals call it the Stone Drum, which may be what Xu Xiake's Yunnan Travel Diary referred to as "a cave below the cave".</p>
<p>The road west after passing the cave is dangerous and difficult to walk, because the ground is slippery after the rain, and the sedan chair carriers struggled, which took a lot of effort. When we reached the top of the mountain, it was noon, so we stopped to rest by the roadside. I took out a barometric altimeter and looked at it, and it had climbed more than 200 meters. The elevation of the Baoshan Plain is 1700 meters, and the reading on the altimeter at that time was 1950 meters. We rested for half an hour and continued to move forward. At that time, the fog in the sky had completely cleared, and there was a hint of sunshine. Since the road was relatively flat, we got out of the sedan chairs and walked. The road was entirely made of yellow earth, which was moist after the rain, making it even more beautiful. We walked for half an hour, and as the road became muddy, we got back into the sedan chairs. The highest elevation of the slope was 2130 meters. From here, we turned downhill. At 2:30 PM, we arrived at Lengshuiqing, and the altimeter reading was 2050 meters. The area is surrounded by mountains, with high peaks and dense forests. There are several thatched huts on the side of the road that also sell food, so we ate there. A bowl of white rice costs 40 cents in new Yunnan currency, equivalent to 20 cents in national currency. The dishes are only ham and cured meat, each small plate costs 1.50 new Yunnan dollars, which tastes quite good. While we were eating, we met two guests, one surnamed Ge and one surnamed He, both from Tengchong County, who had just returned from doing business in Baoshan. They asked if we were going to Tengchong to set up a hydropower plant and expressed their welcome. We set off again at 3:00 PM. From here, the mountain range began to rise again. Half an hour later, we saw the Nujiang River and Gaoligong Mountain overlapping in front of us. The high mountains were light green, and the Nujiang River was dark blue. The haze was layered, with mountains outside the mountains, no different from a natural painting. Below the mountain, there is a small plain. The sedan chair carriers told us that Pu Biao was in sight. I took out a telescope to look at it. Indeed, there was a small town in front of us, with flying eaves clustered together, hidden in the green trees and forests. The sedan chair carriers followed the small mountain road and descended windingly, walking as fast as flying, no longer like walking slowly when climbing the mountain. Before long, we reached the flat ground. I looked at my watch and it was only 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>There is a screen wall gate at the entrance of the town, with white walls and black characters, inscribed "Ancient Yi of Pu Biao" with "Dragon Roar, Tiger Howl" on the left and "Crane Dance, Mandarin Duck Flight" on the right. The gate is small but does not lose its majesty, and the wall is thin but clean and lovely. After entering the town gate, there is a long street lined with houses. The south of the street has small alleys, mostly residential areas. The houses in the city were originally very neat, but this spring, they were burned down by a fire due to carelessness. As a result, broken tiles and dilapidated walls are everywhere. The border town lacks fire-fighting equipment, and when disaster strikes, it cannot be contained. There is the Nanjiang River at the west end of the town, a clear stream of water. A wooden bridge is built over the river in the shape of a corridor. We went to visit it in the evening and stood on the bridge, looking north at the Big Dipper and Little Bear, and thousands of soldiers and horses to the south. The river water flowed slowly under the bridge, leisurely and far away. Occasionally, a breeze blew, and we heard the sound of distant water-powered rice mills rising and falling. There was movement in the stillness, which was very pleasant. Everyone forgot to return in the beautiful scenery, and we only returned to the hostel when the dew was heavy. Pu Biao is famous for producing garlic, and the sweet garlic made by Chunhezhai in the town is popular everywhere.</p>
<p>We went to bed around 10:00 PM that night. While we were sound asleep, we were suddenly awakened by the sound of bells. We heard cattle and horses passing by downstairs, mixed with the shouts of the drivers. We were all surprised at how fast it was dawn, and the traveler in the next room shouted to the waiter to bring water to wash his face. After a while, we heard the waiter lazily reply, "This is an old cow passing by. Cows are afraid of the heat and cannot travel during the day, so they start walking at night. It's the middle of the night, so why are you so impatient?" I shined a flashlight on my watch and saw that it was indeed 1:00 AM, so I went back to sleep.</p>
<p>Observing the Structure of the Riverbed: Climbing Gaoligong Mountain</p>
<p>The next morning, we got up at 5:30 AM, washed up, and had breakfast. The accommodation and two meals cost 3.50 national dollars per person. At 7:30 AM, we set off, crossed the Nanjiang River, and climbed a slope on foot. We often saw Bench Marks set by the Baoteng Highway Survey Team on the side of the road. We walked for an hour,</p>

<p>(1) Enrollment</p>
<p>Two porcelain bowls sat on the desk, filled with dark black liquid, shimmering with golden light in the poorly lit office. Ben Shan and I stood before the desk, writing enrollment advertisements. Each of us held a pen, dipping it into the bowl of liquid in front of us. The two bowls appeared to be the same color, but when the liquid-laden bristles touched the white newsprint, the colors became distinctly different: what I wrote was red, and what Ben Shan wrote was blue. On each sheet of white paper, I wrote:</p>
<p>"Those who can read, please advise; those who cannot read, come quickly to study,"</p>
<p>and after adding words such as "Qualifications," "Tuition," "Registration Date," and "School Address," I handed it to Ben Shan. His blue pen added "Meilun People's School Enrollment" and "Ages 8 to 14," completing the advertisement as follows.</p>
<p>Every time we wrote ten or so, we would put down our pens, wipe the sweat from our foreheads, and exchange a smile. This was a form of mutual comfort. In that dimly lit little room, I could see the light of joy and determination radiating from his large eyes in the darkness, which further encouraged me.</p>
<p>The stack of white paper gradually decreased, while the pile of completed advertisements increased into a thick stack. After approximately five hours of work, we had finished one hundred identical advertisements. At this point, we put down our pens, rubbed our hands, and the exhilaration had already made us forget the soreness in our wrists.</p>
<p>The next morning, we put on straw hats, carried buckets of paste and brooms, and tucked a stack of advertisements under our arms, acting as billposters.</p>
<p>Our target audience was the common people, especially working-class and poor children, so our enrollment advertisements did not need to be found on telephone poles, trees, or walls along wide, flat asphalt roads. We went to areas that "high-minded" people disdained to walk, and never did. Here, there were only dilapidated thatched huts and low-rise bungalows. All one saw were laborers in short clothes and bare feet or bare chests, and children without a stitch of clothing. When we started working, they all looked at us with curious eyes, giving us, the uncommon guests, a scrutinizing gaze. Some even directly asked about the content of our advertisements. Naturally, we could not miss this opportunity, and immediately explained that we were enrolling students for the people's school, that we did not charge tuition, did not limit age, and we also individually asked them how many children they had and whether they would like to come to our school. Some immediately agreed to send their children to school, while others said that the journey was too far, or that their children could not come because they had to work (such as child laborers in factories, scavengers, and street vendors). However, we repeatedly persuaded them, and the results were not entirely disappointing.</p>
<p>Simultaneously with the enrollment advertisements, another aspect of the enrollment work was to summon the students from the people's school of the previous semester, giving them a kind of responsibility, which was to persuade their neighbors and friends to study, and also to give them some enrollment advertisements to post around their residential areas. They were very happy and enthusiastic to accept this mission. The result was also very satisfactory.</p>
<p>The next day, before the scheduled registration time, a group of somewhat familiar faces and ragged children were already waiting outside the school gate. The noise of their conversations made us in the office feel a burst of joy.</p>
<p>Regarding the payment of the five-mao deposit, some were hesitant and stingy, but after a detailed explanation, they understood that it was only used to encourage students to study diligently and to limit their casual absenteeism. If students did not miss more than a week, they could get it back at the end of the semester. Thus, they relievedly took out five mao from their pockets. However, in special circumstances, such as when the family was really too poor, we could also promise to give them the preferential treatment of waiving the fee.</p>
<p>Within the six-day registration period, we counted a total of more than one hundred and sixty registrants. However, even a week after school started, people were still coming to register, but we could not accommodate those who came late due to the classwork and enrollment limits.</p>
<p>(2) Entrance Examination</p>
<p>Before 2 p.m. on the day before school started, the school gate was crowded again. This was the day we held the entrance examination.</p>
<p>After we completed the registration procedures, we made a more detailed statistic based on the resumes. As a result, those who were illiterate accounted for slightly less than half, and the rest had very uneven levels. Some could only write their own names, while others had the level of a senior primary school student. As for age, those under ten years old accounted for 75% of the total, those under fourteen years old accounted for about 24%, and those over fifteen years old were extremely rare. Therefore, we needed to have an entrance examination to determine the classes.</p>
<p>The examination was divided into two parts: those who were illiterate only needed to go through an oral examination. Our purpose was to observe whether the child's age was suitable for the age stipulated in our regulations, whether they could understand the language, and whether they could speak clearly. Because according to our past experience, many shrewd parents wanted to send their children under the age of eight to school to get a little "bargain." Their main purpose was not to give their children a little education, but just to lock the children in school and ask us to take care of them, saving them from being noisy and troublesome at home. But we were not a kindergarten. For such children, in the past, because they were under the age, could not understand the language, and cried and wailed, they would give us a lot of trouble, so we really could not accommodate them. After the parents were not allowed to "beg for mercy," they could only use the method of falsely reporting their age to "sneak" in. After school started, when we found out and asked them to withdraw, the parents would also use the "what's done is done" "fait accompli" to argue, making us feel a little troubled and thorny. Although we finally asked them to withdraw, the shrewd parents still did not give up their principle of "getting away with what they could" to use their "old tricks." Therefore, we had to use the oral examination as an X-ray to expose it. However, all students who came to register were admitted unconditionally except for the condition of insufficient age.</p>
<p>As for those who were literate, we gave them a written test. There were only a few types of test questions, and all grades were the same, but we adopted progressive questions, fill-in-the-blank or multiple-choice, and the content was a mixture of Mandarin and common sense. The questions ranged from shallow to deep, in order to test the students' level and assign them to the appropriate classes.</p>
<p>Based on the test results, we divided these one hundred or so students into three classes: elementary, intermediate, and advanced. Because there were too many students in the elementary class, it was further divided into two groups, A and B. Although when divided into elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels in this way, there were inevitably differences in the levels within each class, we could not open more classes due to the number of teachers and the need to repair and paint the classrooms during the summer vacation. Fortunately, this was only a short six weeks, and our purpose was to give them a little necessary common sense, so that new students could enter the people's school in the next semester after this six-week tutoring, and old students could be able to make up lessons in this summer vacation, and add a little living knowledge, so this kind of class division did not matter much.</p>
<p>(3) Preparatory Work</p>
<p>Regarding the employment of teachers and staff, we had already contacted them in advance before the holidays, although that was only verbal, and they were not very certain in their replies. Now, we needed to go through the formal procedure of issuing letters of appointment. Our organization of this people's school had already been registered with the Municipal Education Bureau before the war, so we could not arbitrarily change the organization according to law. The principal was still our principal, and below him was a director, who was also our teacher. Below that were the positions of teaching affairs and discipline, which were taken up by our classmates themselves. Because our organization was like this, the letters of appointment were stamped and issued by the principal, which indeed gave us a lot of convenience. (1) Because some of the parents of our classmates were afraid that something would go wrong and were not at ease with their children running around outside during the holidays. As a result, they declined our invitation to teach at the school due to family reasons, but after having our formal letter of appointment, the parents trusted their children: secondly, because this letter of appointment was signed by the principal, it was more solemn, so the appointed classmates did not have much to refuse, except for special reasons, and readily accepted it. Otherwise, we would not know how much effort we would have to spend to sell favors to get a promise. With this reason, the work of employing teachers was quickly completed.</p>
<p>This year, one thing worth mentioning is that six of our graduates and alumni of the people's school also came to teach under our persuasion and encouragement. They were all female workers working in factories, but they were able to spare time to take on the entire curriculum of the elementary level (illiterate level). This spirit can prove the achievements of our "learn and teach" small teacher system.</p>
<p>After the duties of the teachers and staff and the teaching affairs were properly drafted, the first full faculty meeting was convened to discuss and approve the proposed distribution of duties. But in general, there was not much change. In addition, the curriculum and textbooks for each grade, and the grade-leveling issues were also within our discussion process. After this meeting, the pre-class problems concerning teachers, grade levels, textbooks, etc. were mostly completely taken care of.</p>
<p>In order to cultivate the spirit of student autonomy, we decided to continue to run the "Discipline Squad" and the "Cleaning Squad," each led by a captain, who were all elected by the students themselves. The task of the discipline squad was to set up posts in the main thoroughfares and maintain order during dismissal. The cleaning squad was responsible for correcting students' cleaning habits and helping younger students with cleaning work, such as wiping their noses and tidying their collars. At the same time, we decided to set up a cleaning banner and an order banner, and add two columns, "Classroom Cleaning Condition" and "Order," in the classroom diary, which were to be judged and filled in by the teachers on duty. A tally was made every weekend, and the results were announced during the memorial week of the following week. The best class would hang the banner in the classroom of that class. If the victory still belonged to that class the following week, then the banner could still be kept in the classroom, otherwise it had to be transferred to another winning class to show the meaning of encouragement</p>

<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>The summer schedule is easier to arrange than usual, because in normal times, teachers are unable to spare time due to school work and extracurricular assignments, so there are many restrictions when scheduling courses, and it is not easy to get a satisfactory schedule. During the summer vacation, teachers have more free time, and there are fewer restrictions, so it is naturally easier and more pleasing to arrange.</p>
<p>In terms of curriculum, Mandarin, common sense, and arithmetic are the main subjects for the senior, intermediate, and elementary levels. In addition, the senior and intermediate and elementary levels have two hours of singing. The senior level also has one hour of practical writing, and the elementary and intermediate levels each have one hour of games and physical education.</p>
<p>The school calendar stipulates that classes start on July 10, but before the 9th, we had already completed all the pre-school preparations; the list of students for each grade and the schedule were announced; the teacher's notices and the schedule were also issued, and everything was just waiting for the arrival of school tomorrow.</p>
<p>(4) The Beginning of a New Life</p>
<p>At 3 p.m. on July 10, the doorman rang the big bell. The loud chime stopped the noise of a large group of students scattered on the playground, and those outside the school gate hurried in, and we led them into the auditorium for the opening ceremony of this semester's first gathering.</p>
<p>Although a large part of those sitting in the auditorium were new children, they were quite orderly when singing the national anthem. More than a hundred small mouths shouted out majestic syllables at the same time, and bathed in this solemn singing, I felt a burst of unspeakable joy in my heart. When reading the Prime Minister's will and being silent, everyone stood at attention neatly and solemnly, without a sound. This situation was also not easy to see before.</p>
<p>The ceremony began with the director's speech. Originally, there was also the principal's speech before this, but unfortunately he was unable to attend temporarily due to being detained by something. Otherwise, we could also listen to the principal's instructions after being separated for more than ten days. What the director said was probably to explain the purpose of studying, and to encourage students to work hard and make progress, as well as to expound the "learn and teach" small teacher system promoted by our school. Then, the dean of teaching affairs and the dean of student affairs reported on school affairs and the rules of attention for going to and from class, and the ceremony was over. Then, the class teachers led the classes into the classrooms to conduct the class teacher's instructions and distribute new books and other matters. The first day's work ended here.</p>
<p>That night, I was so excited that I couldn't sleep. My mind was full of images of the school building, the noise of the children, and the work of tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and the day after the day after tomorrow...</p>
<p>(5) Extracurricular Activities</p>
<p>In the first few days of school, the order after class was inevitably a bit chaotic. Three days later, we could already find our "little policemen" everywhere in the school. They stood proudly in their posts, with a white cloth wrapped around their arms with the words "Discipline Officer" on them. Spirited and lively, they performed their duties. The chief of the discipline squad patrolled and inspected everywhere.</p>
<p>Discipline officers were selected from each class, and there were only twelve places. Therefore, many students who were not selected flocked to the office as soon as class was over, asking to participate in the discipline officer service. Because the number of places was limited, we had tried our best to expand and change the methods to allow a new batch of discipline officers to take turns to serve every day; but the result still could not satisfy the desires of 80% of the other children, so they came to the office every day to trouble us until a week later when it subsided slightly. These were certainly troublesome things for us, but this enthusiastic spirit gave us immense comfort in our hearts.</p>
<p>After a week of investigation, these "little policemen" all faithfully performed their duties. There were no more disturbances, rushes, or noises on the escalators or by the sand-filtered water tank. At the same time, the most energetic performance was in the ten minutes before 3 p.m., when the school gate was not yet open. The discipline officers had already arranged the students' queues neatly according to the grade and height of the classes. Row after row, they waited in silence until the preparatory bell rang, and they filed through the school gate. This action was done without any teacher giving guidance or supervision. To passersby outside the door, it might first give him a deep impression.</p>
<p>In addition to memorial week and low- and intermediate-level games, there was one hour a week that was the students' own time, which was the weekly meeting. In this one hour, they had the opportunity to practice public speaking. Everyone eagerly grasped this opportunity when it was their turn to speak, and never let it go easily. Although, due to their level, they could only tell stories. But some stories have deeply moved me. From their remarks, I can see that they have vigorous vitality and firm and correct beliefs. This makes me firmly believe that we will definitely be able to gradually approach a bright future.</p>
<p>In order to further enhance their interest in public speaking, the school also held a school-wide speech contest, and each class selected representatives to participate. The results were certainly more exciting than the usual weekly meetings. In addition, there were also cleaning and order competitions, and calligraphy competitions. These winners all received the rewards they deserved. Therefore, in our school, everyone has developed a spirit of advancing, competing, and striving upwards, both in academics and extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>(6) Faculty Meeting</p>
<p>This afternoon was indeed memorable and evocative, that is, the faculty meeting on the afternoon of August 4. We felt that there was too little contact between the teachers and staff last semester. During class, everyone took a piece of chalk from the office and went to class. After class, everyone dropped the roll call sheet, patted the chalk dust, and turned away. There were few opportunities for teachers to meet, so naturally there was no talk of feelings. Therefore, sometimes some teachers were discouraged due to student stimulation or other reasons, and thus resigned. In order to make up for this shortcoming, the convocation of the full faculty meeting was indeed urgent.</p>
<p>This afternoon was spent in a tense, enthusiastic, harmonious, and joyful atmosphere. At three o'clock, everyone gathered around the long table made up of eight lab tables, and the chairman stood up to explain the purpose of today's meeting. After ten minutes, we began to discuss according to the scheduled order. The first thing was the issue of teacher absenteeism. Although this phenomenon was rare during the summer vacation, it gave us great difficulty last semester, or it will continue to bother us next semester! Therefore, it became one of the discussion issues. According to everyone's opinions, it was believed that it could be divided into two reasons. One was that the teachers did not recognize the difference between "obligation" and "responsibility." Many people thought that teaching at the people's school was a "unpaid" obligation, so it didn't matter if they missed a few classes, anyway, the school had no right to interfere, otherwise they would simply use resignation to blackmail the school. Therefore, our current top priority is to hold teacher training sessions, with the aim of discussing people's education issues, exchanging teaching experiences and insights, so that teachers have a correct understanding of people's education. The second reason is that, as mentioned earlier, there is no contact between teachers, no deep feelings, or teachers are sometimes stimulated by students and other reasons, such as putting on the airs of a teacher when they are in class, and disdaining to approach students after class, so that there is no emotion between teachers and students. Therefore, they are discouraged and feel that they have no interest in people's education. The remedy is to convene regular faculty meetings, on the one hand, to connect feelings, so as to encourage and urge each other, and on the other hand, to jointly discuss teaching affairs, so that the school affairs of the entire school are shared on everyone's shoulders, and the success or failure of the school is the responsibility of all teachers and staff.</p>
<p>The second thing was the problem of student absenteeism: at the beginning of the school year, the students were often full of talent, but by the time of the holidays, there were very few in the classroom. This was also a serious problem that was felt last semester. Our conclusion was this: the reasons due to the school itself are: (1) teacher absenteeism, which gives students a bad impression, which has been mentioned earlier, (2) the conflict between class time and factory work time, the solution is to prepare to restore the workers' night shift. As for the reasons on the student side are: (1) students have no perseverance, (2) parents are reluctant, many of which are due to feudal ideas, thinking that letting "little girls" run around in public and mix with boys is inappropriate and thus obstructing them, (3) economic problems, students cannot but give up studying and go to work to help the family due to family economic difficulties and rising prices. At the same time, the aforementioned school class time also has a great relationship, and the improved method is to strengthen family visits to help them solve difficulties and encourage students who have no perseverance.</p>
<p>The third thing was to discuss the progress of the school's affairs next semester and elect responsible personnel. As a result, five people were elected to form an enrollment committee to handle all the procedures before the start of school, so as to transfer it to the person in charge next semester.</p>
<p>During the discussion, everyone spoke eagerly, and the enthusiasm of the situation was only seen in all previous discussions. When one of the discussion items was about to be completed, everyone touched their stomachs and looked at the big bottle of Russian soda on the table suspiciously, wondering if they could drink it. But at this time, someone suddenly proposed to hold a basketball scrimmage on the playground before taking advantage of the thirst to solve these huge sodas. Undoubtedly, everyone responded in unison, immediately threw off their coats, formed three groups of four people each, and implemented a round-robin. Even those classmates who never participated in sports at ordinary times were happily chasing the basketball at this time. Hunchbacks, protruding bellies, tall and short, fat and thin, reflecting each other, "wonderful" postures emerged one after another, and laughter could not help but arise one after another. But everyone forgot why, and bravely and decisively fought calmly. It was not until everyone was exhausted and their bodies were bathed in sweat that they stopped. At this time, the clock had pointed to six o'clock. After eating soda, everyone dragged their tired bodies and excited and happy moods on the way home.</p>
<p>(7) Closing Ceremony</p>
<p>In a semester, it is often busier at the beginning and end of the semester, and the busy thing is the hands rather than the mouth. On the contrary, it is more leisure during the semester, and then the busy thing is the mouth rather than the hands, because the registration procedures must be handled at the beginning of the semester, and the admission examination papers must be reviewed, etc. At the end of the semester, you are busy changing the semester exam papers, filling out and issuing grade reports, returning deposits, registering new and old students, etc. Now that the semester is about to end, - August 19 - reports, returning deposits, registering old students, and semester exams are all waiting for us to carry out immediately, but this year, because we have increased the authority and responsibility of the class teacher in order to conform to the principle of "all teachers and staff are jointly responsible for school affairs," the academic and moral performance of students in each class and subject is the responsibility of the class teacher to collect from each teacher, and after the settlement is completed, it is handed over to the teaching affairs office. The teaching affairs office is only responsible for filling out and issuing reports, and the work is relatively much easier.</p>
<p>We planned to hold a closing ceremony on the afternoon of the 19th to end the summer vacation. That day was Monday, so we had a full day on Sunday to handle all kinds of preparatory work, handle prizes, prepare to issue deposits, and fill out reports.</p>
<p>Everything that happened at the opening ceremony six weeks ago is still very clearly presented in my mind, and today's closing ceremony is very similar to it. We are still holding it in the small laboratory and canteen-cum-auditorium, but the podium is piled with a lot of prizes, and more than a hundred children are staring at it with wide eyes and excitement. However, the mystery they urgently need to know - who can win - will not be revealed until the last fifteen minutes, after Director Chen finishes his speech and the teaching affairs office and the student affairs office report on school affairs. These prizes are divided into four types: "Learning Award," "Work Award," "Diligence Award," and "Character Award" which combines good character and academics. All those who serve in the discipline squad and the cleaning squad with excellent results will get the "Work Award"; those whose academic performance in the semester is ranked in the top three of the whole class will get the "Learning Award"; those who never miss class or are late in a semester will get the "Diligence Award"; those whose character and academic performance are all above A will be given the "Character Award". When they accepted the prizes with excitement and joy, the closing ceremony was over. Then, each grade returned to their classroom to issue report cards and deposits, but if the students of each grade continued to come to school next semester, they only needed to exchange for a new receipt, and the procedure for returning the deposit could be omitted. More than 70% of them were unwilling to take back the deposit, that is to say, more than 70% of the students will still come to school next semester, which is enough to make us excited.</p>
<p>Finally, we also led all the children to the Public Works Bureau Girls' High School to participate in the "Meilun, Xiude Elementary School, St. Mary's, Public Works Bureau Girls' High School, Changping Road Elementary School Five School Charity School Joint Speech Contest," which started at 4:30 p.m., as the most meaningful ending of this semester.</p>
<p>(8) A Meaningful Ending</p>
<p>"The 20th century is the century of children!"</p>
<p>"We want to be children of the new China!"</p>
<p>"We want to make compulsory Ning schools last forever!"</p>
<p>As soon as we walked into the Public Works Bureau Girls' High School gate, we could see that the solemn auditorium was covered with these slogans, many of which were naturally written by children, and others were written by small teachers. Entering the arched auditorium door, we could also find slogans posted on the stage. But the main things were two pictures, one read: "Children! Listen quietly!" Below were many children listening quietly; the other read: "Children! Sit and watch!" Below were pictures of sitting postures. What was even more interesting was the "Function of Public Education" posted on the left wall: In the upper left corner of the picture is an illiterate person with his eyes covered with cloth, who is led into the public school by an arrow, and after entering the classroom and listening to the lecture, he is led into the lower right corner by the last arrow. The illiterate has become a small teacher with two mustaches, teaching others in a very serious way. This picture is quite eye-catching. In short, the venue was full of a lively, joyful, and fresh atmosphere.</p>
<p>It was stipulated that it would start at 4:30, but because two schools were far away and the students were too young, it was not until they arrived that all the guests, small teachers, and children participating in the conference were gathered to take a group photo, and it was already 5:30. The chairman was a female student, and as soon as she took the stage, she briefly and quickly reported the theme of today's speech - the senior level focuses on ideological theory, the intermediate level focuses on morality, and the elementary level focuses on civic common sense, as well as the participating schools, the names and numbers of the contestants in each group, and then first invited Ms. × to give a speech. Her feelings about this meeting were: it is a very happy thing that the children in this area can hold a speech contest in such a stable and solemn environment. Therefore, I hope that you children can make use of this superior environment to learn more. The speech ended with a burst of warm applause.</p>
<p>Then began the elementary-level competition. The first to take the stage was an eight- or nine-year-old girl, who spoke very fluently. She told the story of a child whose sincere and unwavering determination resulted in her mother's dangerous illness being cured. Her graceful, experienced, and composed posture made it unbelievable that she was the lowest grade student in the school.</p>
<p>Each group of elementary, middle, and high levels sent one representative from each school to participate, so there were a total of five people in each group. After each group finished speaking, the four judges immediately reported the results. When the judges were calculating the scores each time, the children from each school took turns performing, and what they performed were choruses of their most proficient songs. When these hundreds of small mouths burst out with loud and neat songs at the same time, the guests in the audience were deeply moved by the majestic singing.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the break, I had the opportunity to make a more careful observation and comparison of the children of each school. Among the five schools, Xiude and Meilun had the most students, both with more than 120 people. Among them, the children of Changping Road Elementary School were the most interesting. They were all the children of Jiangsu and Zhejiang scavengers in uniform blue cloth shirts and pants, barefoot, and bald-headed. They could not get rid of the local accent when speaking, and their actions were more lively than the children of other schools.</p>
<p>The topics of the senior speakers were all about theory and current events in the central government. From their simple speeches, we can get encouragement and feel that the bright future is definitely not far away. In particular, the last speaker's "The Meaning of Public Education" really made us admire them.</p>
<p>When the judges reported the rankings of the speakers in the last group - the senior group - and issued the prizes, the chairman happily touched the cleared table and announced the end of the meeting, and the sirens of the factories around had told us that it was seven o'clock.</p>
<p>After stepping out of the gate with a reluctant, melancholic, and excited mood, I reluctantly looked at the lively and jumping backs and secretly blessed them.</p>
<p>(9) Epilogue</p>
<p>The semester has ended, and we are handling the work of recruiting new students, as well as sorting out school equipment and preparing for handover. However, that group of active and lively backs are still lingering in my mind, and I seem to hear them shouting in my ears: "Mr. Guo! See you tomorrow!", "...". I feel that during this summer vacation, whether it is my feelings for them or their feelings for me, they are extremely warm and harmonious. I don't remember and pay attention to when it started, and I don't know who taught them. When they are carrying their small schoolbags home in the twilight, if they see me, they will always shout: "See you tomorrow." When they are free after class, they often drag my hem, asking to play with them, and even many who have never attended my class, and I don't know their names, but they treat me so affectionately, but this is not limited to a certain teacher, as long as he is a teacher who is not perfunctory, does not often miss class, and often contacts them, he can always get the same treatment. Sometimes, I feel that when some words are told to them by us, they are very happy to listen to them. On the contrary, sometimes the same words are spoken by their parents, but they are regarded as wind in their ears. This is probably due to respecting their freedom and the result of a group life with rewards and punishments. In short, I think the reason why they are like this is because the family has failed to satisfy them. Their parents either work day and night and lack contact with them, or they have no knowledge, alcoholism, gambling, and arbitrarily beat and scold them; so there is no emotion between flesh and blood. The children can only entrust their love to the teachers, so I feel that living, learning, and guiding them in such a group will not make a teacher feel extremely discouraged and say: "I will never teach in a public school again, I never want to see them again!"</p>
<p>I only want to live forever in this harmonious group full of naivety, honesty, and love. I want to learn from them and guide them at the same time. This is my only wish.</p>

<h3>Record of the Tengchong Hydropower Survey – Continued from Page Eighteen</h3>
<p>Reaching the mountain top, at an elevation of 1,500 meters, we boarded sedan chairs, carried by porters down the mountain. At that time, the morning mist in the mountains was thick, the shadows of the trees were blurred, the clouds and mountains were ethereal, the fields were quiet, and all the ridges were silent. Sitting idly in the sedan chairs, we only heard the porters' feet stepping on the mud and sand, making rustling sounds, their steps neat and rhythmic, which was quite intriguing. At 9:20 AM, we arrived at Machang. Upon inquiring, we learned it was called Wenxiangdao, with only a few houses, appearing like a small village. The porters asked for a break, so we got out of the sedan chairs. It happened that someone was holding a funeral, and the villagers were gathered in one place. The bereaved family set up tables along the road to treat guests. As we were resting in a teahouse, the bereaved son also came to invite us to the banquet. After several polite refusals, we were excused. We set off again at 10:00 AM. The mountain gradually entered a wild area, where people walked among the trees, with winding vines and disordered weeds. At 11:00 AM, we rested beside a canyon with a sheer rock wall and rushing water. Looking down thousands of feet, it was frightening. We started off again, descending along the valley bank. Due to the steep slope, the road was built in terraces. After walking for half an eternity, the view at the bottom of the valley gradually widened. I took out binoculars to observe the structure of the riverbed and the speed of the water flow, and every detail was clearly visible. The riverbed, like the mountain road, naturally formed terraces. At each step down, the water accumulated to form a pond. The river water flowed down the steps, changing color three times. When it flowed over the stone steps, it appeared yellow because the water was clear and the stones were yellow. When it fell from the stone steps, it became white as a waterfall due to the rapid flow. Then, it was stored at the bottom of the pond, and because the water was deeper, it presented a jade color! Emerging from here and walking on the steps again, it regained the yellow color. Such color cycles, combined with the changing water patterns, created a spectacular scene, which we enjoyed immensely. After another half hour of walking, the valley opened up, and the Gaoligong Mountains were visible in the distance. At 12:15 PM, we crossed the Yihui Bridge and descended along the right side of the valley. The mountain on the left gradually became flat, with green peaks and lush grass. At 11:30 AM, as the weather became hotter, we rested under a large yellow oak tree by the roadside. The tree was very large, with thick branches and leaves, and the trunk was covered with fruit, shaped like crabapples. Leaning against the tree, we looked out at the Lujiang River, a ribbon of water. At 1:00 PM, we set off again, descending rapidly along the road. Soon we reached the riverbank. The river was 200 meters wide, and large bridge piers were built in the center, with two iron cable bridges connecting the two banks. The eastern one was called Huiren Bridge, and its name was engraved on the stone wall of the riverbank. The western bank was called Lujiang Bridge, with a plaque inscribed "Hushui" by former Premier Li Genyuan. The two bridges were renovated by the Tengchong Chamber of Commerce, spanning the river with majesty and grandeur. The river water was gray and flowed rapidly. Nearby, there was a Zhuge Liang monument, but due to our hasty passage, we were unable to visit its ruins, which was a great pity.</p>
<p>Crossing the bridge, there was a small town, Lujiang Town, under the jurisdiction of the Lujiang Tusi (local chieftain). When we arrived, it happened to be market day, and local people from nearby gathered here for trade, many of whom were Baiyi and Lisu people. The Baiyi were very similar to the Yue people, with long clothes and black teeth. The women wore blue cloth wrapped around their heads to form tall hats, which were strangely shaped. I had heard people say that Baiyi girls were very beautiful (Figure 7), with bright eyes and white teeth, charming and lovely, dressed in white and blue skirts, which added to their beauty. Therefore, the locals had a saying: "Baiyi girls are beautiful, truly beautiful; Han girls are beautiful with makeup." However, according to Baiyi customs, once a girl gets married, she starts chewing betel nut with grass tobacco, which stains her teeth black and no longer protects her natural beauty. Therefore, the locals also have a saying: "Young, they look like Guanyin; old, they look like monkeys." On this day, we mostly encountered women, and the beauty of the so-called Baiyi girls was never seen. The Lisu were also a type of Yi people, with headscarves and bare feet, adorned with silver rings and clam shells. They liked to wear blue clothes with very narrow trousers. When they saw us passing by, they stared at us and whispered to each other. We originally regarded them as exotic, but who knew that they also regarded us as objects of their appreciation!</p>
<p>Lujiang is only 700 meters above sea level, more than 700 meters lower than Pubiao. Therefore, the climate is extremely hot. All of our companions were sweating profusely. Merchants traveling through here generally avoid eating too much, so we only ate a few biscuits for lunch. The locals also told us that there was often miasma on the 300-li road from Baoshan to Tengchong. Upon investigation, the reason may be that the temperature fluctuates too much between day and night. Outsiders are unaware and easily catch colds. It is not really a so-called miasma.</p>
<p>We left Lujiang at 3:00 PM and began climbing the Gaoligong Mountains. The mountain road wound through vines, with vegetation on both sides towering over our heads. From the thickets, we could hear the sound of spring water. At about 4:00 PM, we saw the Manle River, a canyon thousands of feet deep, winding down from the mountains. The river had many shoals and rapid currents, and the water hit the rocks, making a sound like thousands of horses galloping, which was frightening. We walked along the left side of the river. At 5:00 PM, we crossed the Jiyi Bridge and climbed hundreds of feet up a mountain, reaching a peak. The Manle River was already at our feet, and the Jiyi Bridge was so small that it could no longer be seen. At that time, a crescent moon was already hanging in the sky, the sky was clear as if washed, and there was not a single cloud. With a long whistle, the mountains echoed.</p>
<p>From here, we went down a small valley and climbed up again. The forest in the mountains was denser, with tangled roots intertwined. Even trees as big as bowls were entangled with each other, forming a twisted shape. The mountain road faced the canyon and backed against the mountain, making it extremely dangerous. The canyon was thousands of feet deep, with sheer rock walls and strange trees growing on the cliffs. Suspended springs and waterfalls flowed between them. We often heard the long howls of apes and the low chirps of autumn insects, which were especially poignant. There was a lot of bamboo in the valley, growing in clusters from the bottom of the valley. The trunks were slender and long, and many branches and leaves drooped, forming an arch shape. Two trees faced each other, forming arch bridges, which were green and lovely. People in the mountains wove bamboo into huts to live in. Others broke bamboo into pipes, extending for miles, to draw mountain spring water into their homes. Walking and walking, we finally reached Laozhai, our lodging station, at 6:30 PM. The village was on the mountainside, at an altitude of 1,490 feet. From Lujiang to here, we had climbed a total of more than 700 meters. The difficulty of climbing can be imagined. The owner of the inn where we stayed was surnamed Cun. He said that his ancestor, Cun Dajin, had used all his family property to renovate the Gaoligong Mountain road. After a year of hard work, he personally supervised the workers, opening the road on one side and providing tea on the other. He leveled steep slopes and widened narrow roads, finally achieving his goal and benefiting later generations. His spirit of public service and selflessness is truly admirable. I saw a spring couplet pasted on his door, which read: "For hundreds of years, the road was rugged; now it is smooth. For thousands of miles, merchants travel; now they arrive safely." This can truly be said to be worthy of the praise. That day, we traveled 90 li in the mountains. Because we were too tired, we went to bed early.</p>
<p>Terraced Fields Surround the Basin – Horns of the Olive Village</p>
<p>On the morning of the tenth day, we got up at 6:00 AM. After breakfast, we each paid a yuan and fifty cents for meals and lodging. At 8:00 AM, we set off and continued climbing. The mountain stones were mostly sedimentary rocks, weathered over the years, with extremely loose and brittle texture. When we tapped them with our canes, they peeled off like snowflakes. There was a lot of sand on the road, with glittering mica, indicating that it was formed by the weathering of the mountain rocks. At 10:00 AM, we reached an altitude of 2,200 meters and encountered light rain, which stopped after a while. After being bathed in the rain, the trees were even more supple and lush, with a deep green color that seemed to drip. Climbing up and looking at the mountains to the northwest, they were all deeply hidden in the thick fog and could no longer be seen. Then, the sunlight came out from the clouds. Looking back at the valley, the water vapor slowly rose from below. The sunlight illuminated it, reflecting it into white clouds, which stretched for hundreds of miles. The peaks were hidden among them, floating like small islands on the sea. I had heard of the sea of clouds in Mount Emei for a long time and longed to see it, but I had no chance. I never thought that I would be able to see this scene on the top of the Gaoligong Mountains, which was enough to satisfy my eyes and satiate my travel aspirations!</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM, we reached Pinghe Village, which was the top of the Gaoligong Mountains, at an altitude of 2,310 meters. We had lunch at a small shop by the roadside. There were four dishes, all potatoes, but prepared in different ways, with different colors and flavors. They were crisp and delicious, and we all praised the owner's ingenuity. After lunch, we went down the mountain. The slopes were steep and there were many gullies, and the mud was muddy after the rain, making it extremely difficult to walk. Unfortunately, we were attacked by a shower in the middle of the road. For a moment, the rain filled the sky, and the mountain trees were hidden. It was extremely cold, and I sat withered in the sedan chair, my hands numb. At 3:00 PM, the mountain gradually opened up, the clouds and fog were swept away, and we saw a basin-shaped depression in front of us, with small villages scattered on the mountainsides and terraced fields surrounding them in a neat and green manner. The scenery was excellent. Looking into the distance, the Longjiang River appeared and disappeared. After going down the mountain, we passed a stone-paved road, which was flat and clean. Walking on it, we walked lightly. Before 5:00 PM, we reached the Longjiang River by the river, also known as Longchuan River, which wound its way from the north. The river was narrow, and the flow was only one-third of that of the Lujiang River. However, the altitude was 600 meters higher than that of the Lujiang River, so the current was very fast, and the waves were surging. The river water flowed straight down, with a force of a thousand miles. We rested at the tax office for half an hour before crossing the bridge and climbing up a hill for another ten li, reaching Ganlan Village and resting there, at 5:40 PM.</p>
<p>Ganlan Village belongs to Tengchong County. It is built on the mountainside, with many houses, somewhat similar in style to Pubiao, but not as clean as Pubiao. As we were resting in the inn, we suddenly heard a loud horn outside the village, resounding through the air. Looking out the door, we saw a team of farmers in straw raincoats and hats, lined up from the fields. One person led the way with a large triangular red flag, with the words "Ganlan Village Cultivation Banner" written on it. The innkeeper told us that they were returning from plowing in the fields. Because the area is 1,530 meters above sea level, with high terrain, backing against the mountains and facing the river, the climate is cold. Therefore, the rice seedlings are planted later. It was already the seventh month of the lunar calendar, and the rice seedlings were only about a foot tall!</p>
<p>Heavy Rain Overwhelms the Mountains – Arriving at the Destination, Tengchong</p>
<p>We departed at 8:00 AM on the morning of the eleventh day, still climbing the mountain along the stone path. At that time, the morning mist was heavy, and all the peaks were hidden. The air was full of water vapor, and we could not sweat. After climbing for half an hour, we felt hot all over. At 9:00 AM, there was light rain, and we encountered a muddy road, which was slippery and difficult to walk on. We rested for a few miles at an altitude of 2,000 meters. After half an hour, we set off again and climbed another 300 meters. At 10:30 AM, we reached the newly built highway by the people of Tengyue. The road ran along the mountainside to the west, and was wide enough for four cars. The soil was mostly sandy, which was likely formed by the weathering of rocks, which was very beneficial for road construction. However, when we passed by, it happened to be the busy farming season and the rainy season, so work had been temporarily suspended. Along the way for ten li, we did not see a single person. At 11:30 AM, we re-entered the small road. From here, the road was even more slippery and the mud was deeper. Watching the sedan chair carriers stumble in the mud, it was even more difficult. The weather was not good, and before noon, a heavy rain suddenly fell, overwhelming the mountains, with the force of thunder and lightning. The sedan chair carriers had no choice but to</p>

<h3>Record of the Tengchong Hydropower Survey – Continued from Page Nineteen</h3>
<p>Venture to travel in haste. Fortunately, in just a few minutes, we arrived at Qincaitang, but our clothes were already soaked through. We took shelter from the rain at a small shop by the roadside. We waited in the shop for two hours before the rain weakened slightly, but the mud and water on the road had accumulated to a foot deep, overflowing into a small river. After the water receded, another half hour passed, and we finally set off again. From here, we went down the mountain alongside it. Because of the mud after the rain, the sedan chair carriers fell into the mud several times, and the difficulty of traveling was hard to describe. But soon the mountain gradually became flat, and the sky gradually cleared. At 4:00 PM, we crossed another slope and saw the Tengyue Prairie in the valley below! The sedan chair carriers showed me the direction of the county town. I took out my binoculars and saw the battlements faintly visible among the clouds and trees. As we got closer, the shops in the villages gradually came into view. The sedan chair carriers pointed to the white buildings on the outskirts of the city, telling me that one was the customs office and the other was the town government, in great detail. At 4:30 PM, we passed Nijiapu, turned right for a hundred steps, and then turned left across a long embankment. We saw a pailou (archway), magnificent and resplendent. The sedan chair carriers told me that this was the Jieguan Pavilion, five li from the city, where officials were greeted and sent off in the past. As we were admiring it, a gentleman suddenly approached the sedan chair and introduced himself as the secretary of the county chamber of commerce. He said that he had been sent by Chairman Xie to welcome us. Upon hearing this, we hurriedly got out of the sedan chairs and followed him into the city on foot, arriving at the county chamber of commerce on Wubao Street to rest. In total, the journey from Kunming to Tengchong was more than 1,500 li, and it finally came to an end.</p>
<p>That evening, Chairman Xie Shinan hosted a banquet to welcome us, and invited people from all walks of life to accompany us. We were all of school age and had little experience of the world. We were a little overwhelmed by such a warm welcome. During the banquet, we discussed the construction of the hydropower plant. Everyone present hoped that the hydropower plant could be established as soon as possible to lay the foundation for the industrial development of the border town. I thought that if the construction of a local public welfare project could get such "harmony" among the people, the future would be very promising.</p>
<p>Surveying the Dieshuihe Waterfall – Completing the Survey Work</p>
<p>The next day, at 2:00 PM, we were led by the chamber of commerce's Secretary Li to survey the area near the Dieshuihe Waterfall. The Dieshuihe River is one li southwest of the county town. Its water comes from the mountains of Chituoluo and forms the Daying River. It flows through Nandian, south through Qianya, out of the pass and merges with the Manmo River, entering the Nanda Jinsha River, and finally entering the sea along Ava City. The rock walls at the waterfall are steep, with a vertical drop of more than a hundred feet. Huge stones stand on the top of the cliff like a door. The river flows here, rushing and galloping, and then falls from the air, like scattered snowflakes, cotton wadding, beaded curtains, flying jade flowers, spraying clouds and spitting foam, splashing on people's clothes. The locals call it "Jiuyu Buqing" (long rain that doesn't clear up). Leaning against the cliff is an old tree, thousands of years old. Its roots have no soil, and its color is like bronze and ancient iron, covered with fallen clothes, mottled and scaly. It twists and turns out of the cracks in the stone. The old trunk lies prostrate, like a dragon raising its head, more than seven feet high and more than ten feet in circumference. There is a huge stone, eight feet wide, three feet high, and five feet wide in the middle, shaped like a giant turtle. Its head is embedded in the old tree for a foot, only revealing its neck. The body and the tree are integrated. The old trunk splits into four branches, stretching into the air, with delicate leaves in strange shapes, standing tall on the cliff, looking down at the deep pool. The torrent roars, shaking the valley, but it stands for thousands of years without being swept away by the waves, because it is intertwined with this turtle stone. Slightly above, there is the Taiji Bridge, spanning the top of the waterfall. The mountains and rivers are magnificent. On the right bank, the mountains are undulating, with a strange peak rising abruptly. On the top of the peak is a flying pavilion, facing the waterfall, called Longguangtai. Green cliffs and green rocks surround it, with beautiful trees and fragrant grass. On the left bank, green walls stand steeply and pour down. There is a peak like a wing. The ruins of the Baiyi Pavilion are there, facing the Pílu Temple stupa. The scenery of the tower and the mountains, the flowing clouds and drifting snow, shine together. The scenery is extremely beautiful. The water flows down from the bottom of the waterfall, and the slope is still very steep. There are many scattered rocks in the river, and the rapids create waves, surging and rushing. It is not until 700 meters downstream that the water surface begins to calm down slightly. The area near the waterfall is rich in hydropower, which is truly magnificent, showing that the beauty of the mountains and rivers is everywhere. It is only because this waterfall is in a remote place that it has not been noticed by the world. This time, the Yunnan Provincial Economic Committee has allocated a large amount of money to build a hydropower plant here, which is truly visionary. The border industry will gradually develop because of the establishment of this plant, and the vast river will be greatly utilized, and it will no longer be day and night to cry out in vain!</p>
<p>Our survey work began on the thirteenth day and lasted for more than twenty days. The topographic survey took six days, the longitudinal profile measurement of the river took one day, the water depth measurement of the dam site upstream and downstream took two days, the installation of water gauges and flow measurement took three days, the measurement of the power transmission lines from the four villages to the county town took seven days, the curved road alignment measurement took one day, and the calculation and drawing took seven days. As of now, most of the work that should be done has been completed, and the school's opening date is also approaching. For the sake of not delaying the students' studies, we hurried back to Kunming. In summary, since this three-month summer vacation, we have either traveled to the top of the mountains or worked by the flowing water. We have been close to nature, and we feel that our knowledge has increased greatly and our bodies have become stronger. It is more beneficial than spending the holidays at home doing nothing! Now that the holidays are coming to an end and the new semester is approaching, I will recount what I remember, writing under the lamp, just to leave a souvenir for the future. (End)</p>
<h3>Baiyi Girl</h3>
<p>(Figure Seven) The Baiyi girl has a beautiful appearance, with bright eyes and white teeth, charming and lovely. She is dressed in white and blue skirts, which adds to her charm. The locals have a saying: "Baiyi girls are beautiful, truly beautiful; Han girls are beautiful with makeup."</p>

<h3>Welcoming National Day</h3>
<p>— Ruolin</p>
<p>Together we wield our halberds, drawing a cross, then drawing another cross! We sacredly advance, treading the blood of our fallen martyrs!</p>
<p>History and our lessons are truly great. "Glorify our ancestors and revitalize the Han people." As we arrive at the 29th National Day, how should we commemorate, reminisce, inspire, and exert ourselves?</p>
<p>Let us reflect on the past: After 1840, we fell into a semi-colonial state. The feudal Qing government also once wanted to strengthen itself, hastily attempting to establish military industries. However, because it lacked a general industrial and economic foundation, it failed miserably. Similarly, because of the corruption of the feudal political institutions, the people not only suffered from foreign oppression but also endured internal exploitation. They rose up to resist several times, but the Qing government, fearing their great power, resorted to the most cruel means of suppression. Under the slogan of "宁赠友邦，毋与家奴" (better to give to foreign friends than to our own slaves), it acted against the tide. It surrendered to foreign powers and became increasingly licentious and shameless.</p>
<p>The masses could no longer endure it. At the same time, revolutionary leaders like Sun Yat-sen keenly realized that only by overthrowing the Qing dynasty and changing the political institutions could China be saved from its decline. They armed the people and, with great sacrifice, launched the Xinhai Revolution, finally overthrowing the feudal government and creating a new China.</p>
<p>This gave foreign powers a new understanding. In addition, they needed to change their tactics, combining both soft and hard approaches. Because of its inherent limitations, the Xinhai Revolution failed to completely eliminate the feudal remnants. Later, Yuan Shikai betrayed the revolution, hindering the success of the Second Revolution. However, Yuan's attempt to become emperor quickly ended. Subsequently, the resurrection of warlords with queues was only a fleeting flash in the pan, and they were all extinguished. But the warlord wars—the Zhili-Anhui War, the Zhili-Fengtian War, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang War, etc.—ultimately prevented China from unifying, and the country became entangled in civil war, allowing it to be "slaughtered" to the fullest extent. The journey from the May Fourth Movement to the May Thirtieth Movement was painful and difficult, but the successful Northern Expedition laid the foundation for the unification of the Chinese nation. No matter how they bombed with cannons, tied with economic restraints, or cunningly seized and plundered, or sowed discord, the Chinese nation was always advancing towards the path of national liberation.</p>
<p>We are currently in the midst of an even greater national revolution. Historically, this is a truly great moment.</p>
<p>The Chinese nation is emitting extreme brilliance in the darkness of the world, and she will enrich the pages of history. Now is not a repetition of the European Middle Ages (although some people are overly worried). History will never regress. China will fearlessly lead the world in the fight for justice. Those who are righteous will have much help, but everyone must rise up in order to help. Reopening the Yunnan-Burma Road is to save the world from destruction.</p>
<p>At this time and in this place, as we celebrate this great holiday, everyone should introspectively examine themselves. A group of licentious and shameless people who live in daydreams will be smashed down by the heavy hammer. Those who obsess over their own private interests, disregarding the entire nation, whether big bugs or small germs (such as tuanmi [speculative rice trading] and other speculators), will be eliminated before the arrival of the light.</p>

<h3>How to Cure "Boredom Disease"</h3>
<p>— Naimin</p>
<p>Today, "boredom" has become a "popular disease" on this isolated island. It casts a shadow over everyone's hearts. It is a spiritual shackle that tightly binds people's minds in a narrow circle of thought, turning lively people into sluggish ones, slowing down the progress of heroes with great ambitions, and turning optimists into prisoners of "pessimism."</p>
<p>As a result, bad consequences arise. The lighter cases create a common "spirit of languor," while the more serious cases result in the "suicide boom" prevalent on the island. Both lead to the grave in a passive way, but the former is more chronic and the latter more acute.</p>
<p>However, "when soldiers come, generals will resist; when water comes, earth will dam." Any sudden or violent illness, as long as it is treated properly, is not without a cure. Although the methods of treating "boredom disease" used by enlightened people throughout history, both Chinese and foreign, have their own subtleties, their fundamentals are the same: work. Boredom that comes from work is of course not difficult to cure with work. Even pain that comes from "career" or "love" can be relieved by work, because at that time you have found a more noble and sacred path. The minor gains and losses of the past are, of course, irrelevant.</p>
<p>Thomas Edison, the world-renowned inventor, once said: "When it comes to curing boredom, work is more effective than whiskey."</p>
<p>Leo Tolstoy once said: "People's happiness is contained in life, and life is work."</p>
<p>Thomas Carlyle, the famous English novelist, also said: "Work is the best cure; it can heal any pain and misfortune on people's heads."</p>
<p>Friends trapped in boredom, stop wandering in the atmosphere of trouble! Quickly invigorate your spirits and take up work! Only work can save you from boredom! Only work can make you a stronger and more noble self.</p>

<h3>The Homecoming of a Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Astonishing News</p>
<p>Yu Gantang seemed to have been electrocuted, suddenly raising his head and looking at Huo Sang with astonished eyes. "What? He lent me a blank pistol? A pistol without bullets? — Mr. Huo, is that true? How do you know?" His voice was full of suspicion. Huo Sang slowly nodded, answering: ...Yes. It's true, but you didn't know it. Your friend Song Zhaoqi has told me everything. He really has quick wit, and what he said is true. That pistol, I just saw it at the police station, and the chamber is indeed completely empty. But at the time, you were intent on causing trouble for Zhao Boxiong, your whole body was controlled by mad emotions, you took the gun and left, and naturally didn't think to check the chamber." Yu Gantang, as if awakened, said: "So that's how it is! I really didn't think Zhaoqi would play this trick. He really is a—"</p>
<p>Huo Sang hurriedly interjected: "Really a loyal good friend, aiming to save you. Right? You should understand now."</p>
<p>Yu Gantang lowered his head, his two hands clasped tightly together. "Yes, yes, he meant well, wanting to pull me out of the mire. But—but at the time, I really didn't think he would do this."</p>
<p>Huo Sang said: "If you had known this trick at the time, maybe you would have fought him? Haha... Okay, I already know about your actions afterward. You took the pistol and rushed to 774 Yadong to find Zhao Boxiong; when you couldn't find him, you returned to Song Zhaoqi's home. Zhaoqi is a young man with insight and understanding of advantages and disadvantages. He repeatedly advised you, telling you that this matter was not worth risking, but you were still stubborn. Later, you took the empty gun again, wanting to find Zhao Boxiong, but you were caught by Detective Ni at the entrance of Changming Lane. Right?"</p>
<p>Yu Gantang nodded repeatedly, saying: "Yes, Mr. Huo, now you can finally believe me, I didn't kill Wang Lilan."</p>

<h3>Laughing to Our Hearts' Content</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>In other words, have we ever deceived the nation? Do we have the right to enjoy today's laughter?</p>
<p>Let me tell those who suffer from heart disease, "When you see the blue-white flag covering the sky, do you tremble and cannot stand? If that is true, then your illness may still be cured. — Starting today, when the sunlight shines red on the ground, use your own hands to wipe away the black spots in your heart and remove the poisonous sores in your lungs!</p>
<p>Listen, the laughter of the masses! That laughter shakes the entire universe, and the whole world is looking forward to the arrival of a more worthy anniversary of laughter!</p>
