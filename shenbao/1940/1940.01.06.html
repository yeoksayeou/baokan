<h3>工商日業之人事糾紛</h3>
<p>自物價飛騰同，工商業職工爲維持生活，要求津貼，遂致發生怠工罷工者，有之，屢見不鮮，所幸雙方多能深明互助互讓之義，均得和平解決。本報於十二月十四日社評「概論工潮」中已懇切言之；蓋望職工弗作過分之要求，資方弗取報復之行動，無爲親者痛而仇者快，即爲國家保持一部分經濟元氣。迺者，總結帳時期相近，以歷來習慣相傳，凡工廠行號之職工解雇問題，輒於總結帳期後行之。竊願百業之主政者，鑒於此際生活艱難，凡可以增加失業問題之嚴重性，並間接可予地方治安以威脅者，在此非常時期，宜可避免者應避免之，不能避免者亦當衡量事故之輕重，而爲公允合理之去留，使留者知所勸，去者服其咎，用昭信賞必罰之精神，穩定持久不敝之機構。不意此决陽歷年關，竟爾發見若干解雇風潮；雖其辭各執，其理各具，要之，在此環境之中，有此糾紛之象，至可痛心者也。</p>
<p>每一糾紛，必各有特殊之事實與因果，吾人若僅根據一般事理而論衡個別問題之曲直是非，自難盡當。雖然，竊願概論之者，即吾人所蘄求，乃爲勞資協調，爲生存互助，相勗以無自決藩籬，而予蓄意破壞者以利用之機會。誠以去年物價而論，十二月分上海生活費指數比之戰前增加兩倍，即在上下半年，若米麥麵粉，兩倍以上其値，油價且三倍之；又如熱水一杓戰前售一分七厘而今售五分，貨幣一元之購買力，只及戰前百分之三二·八九，若是之生活狀况，誠爲一般職工處境所難堪，工商業遇進貨價貴，或開支膨脹，則可隨之而將其貨物漲價，以爲取償之地步；則職工因生活費用非常之擴大，而仍享其原有之薪工，試問何以度日，何以挹注，何所取償乎？是以職工爲維持其生活而伸訴其願望，自有同情攷慮之必要。彼出以羣衆之姿態者，亦自以其事關羣衆，未可憾其聲勢之跡近要挾而遽以更盛之聲勢報之也。此在職工方面，亦必多方顧念，善謀克伸願望之道；不若是而以要挾爲得計，則其計亦左矣。抑自物價步漲以來，各公司商店類能自動改善職工待遇：有加薪者，有破例而設津貼制者，有增給津貼，甚且超越房來薪津者，有購備米糧賤價轉供職工糶食者，其法不一，其例甚多，其意良可取。平心而論，去年上海之工商百業，除少數特殊事業而外，大體確屬畸形發展，畸形繁榮；一般利潤之厚，雖謂爲空前，殆無不可。綠是而優遇職工，自得情理之正。然亦以其發展繁榮之爲畸形焉，又何嘗不應戒懼於畸形之以去年爲最後之一年。蓋畸形之由來，乃因物價與黑滙之步漲，故凡有存貨者，預結外滙者，皆利市三倍；更有利用「統制」「運輸」發「國難財」者，不問其爲甘爲苦，爲薰爲蕕，綠是而腰纏纍纍者正不知多少。及歐戰發作，又一居奇壟斷之機會，不論其爲洋貨土貨，莫不有同樣之作風。夫資方有所獲，職工稍分其餘瀝，於理固亦應分也。其間亦有營業無從進行，徒以維持職工生計而勉力支撐，寗願坐蝕開支者，求之上海百業之中，亦不爲少見，此其矜憐同仁之情緒，抑何深切而溫厚耶。此其人，固以體念時勢艱難，風雨同舟，斯推其仁惠；然種因於今日，後果在來茲，人非木石，孰不奮發圖報？要知事業之欣欣向榮，謂在辦法之嚴刻，寗若人情之融洽，善於經營者，必能體認及此也。</p>
<h3>中國國民參政會　籲請美制裁日本　深信美不致與晶續訂商約　遠東安定擊於美今後政策</h3>
<p>重慶　中國人民參政會今日請美國禁止軍火材料之運日、蓋日本今日對華之侵略、其所用之軍火原料皆來自美國也、參政會皆認美國究與日本續約與否、此為日本之內政、故非局人所得擅加議論者、但「中國人民深信美國旣不致與晶續約、亦不致與日本成立臨時辦法、繼續兩國之貿易、唯就遠東大局言、中國人民極盼美國能伯進一步之行動、又參政員廿介候今晨在此間作對美之播音、「美國假若於此而繼續將軍火原料供給日本、則無非故意延長侵略者之生命、故君等不能阻止敵人、使我人獲得早期之勝利、則至少亦將不為日本之助力、」（五日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　留渝國民參政會參政員乘新年休會之機會、對於本月廿六日滿期之美日商的問題、頗多討論，僉以美國是否續訂商約事、屬美國內政問題、未使發表意見、唯以美日之商務前途與遠東安定世界和平皆極有關係、根據中美之深摯友誼、我國國民似應對其見解率直訴諸美國民衆、自暴日發動侵華戰爭以來、其軍火及軍需原料之來源仰賴於美國者、在質量兩方面均極重要、因此特公推副議長張伯苓氏擇期對美廣播、務期美國朝野能澈底明瞭我國民　之觀點云、（五日電）</p>
<h3>美政府對日　暫取靜觀態度　日本政策如下收易轍　經濟制裁方案勢在必行</h3>
<p>華盛頓　據美國參院外交委員會主席畢德曼今日對美國合衆社記者言、渠意在正月二十六日美日商約正式廢止之前、外交委員會不致對日本作禁運輸出物之想、外交委員會大約可於星期三集合、但所注意之問題、將以國內問題爲限、又據畢氏言、就渠個人言、渠贊成國會對日作禁止輸出之決議、唯此項提案在目前未必能獲得國會之通過、故渠主張仍以前此所通過之決議案爲辦法、即由國會授權總統相機對日本作輸出之禁止、據超然方面觀察、團務院方面之主張、即在一月二十六日之前先授日本以種種改進對美關係之機會、至畢德曼之意思則認日本侵犯美國在華權益之處、尙未充分加以糾正、美國對於日本之反應雖極綏慢、但日本必須尊軍在華權益之主張則已日見有力、此問一般人之印象、認爲日本在一月二十六日之前、若尙不能對美作滿意之解決、則國務院將請國會通過對日之經濟制裁方案、蓋至其時、對日制裁方案必塲於在國會中通過、因美國遷就日本之處皆巳失效、除對日强硬之外更無他法也、至於目前則以取靜觀態度爲最得法、（五日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>土公使致謝　慰問災祲　並訪回敎敎友</h3>
<p>重慶　土耳其此决地震水災損害奇重、我國蔣委員長於接見土公使時、曾面請向土總統轉達慰問、今晨十一時半、土公使特面謁王外長、謂奉政府訓令、面致土總統謝意、請轉達蔣委員長、（五日電）</p>
<p>重慶　土耳其公使席拉希氏到渝後、中國回敎救國協會代表、曾以同敎兄弟關係拜訪、並作暢談、五日下午四時、度公使偕秘書特赴張家花園訁會答訪、當由該會副理事長唐杰三及各理事三席招待、席氏當謂、今日能坐在中國回敎兄弟組織之總機關、與諸君暢談、心中實有無限快樂、對於白理事長慰問災情之電、再四稱謝、詢及在中國內之古蘭經多係鈔本、是否有近代印本、唐氏吿以除鈔本外、間有木刻本、五年前成達師範學校在北平自行影印、爲中國創始之印本、三以示之、席極爲贊美、賓主暢談的一時餘、始興辭而出、（五日電）</p>
<h3>軍事捷報頻傳　倫敦中國公債趨漲風</h3>
<p>倫敦　中國公債昨日驟漲、究其原因、不外乎不久將有切實努力、以期中日戰爭早獲解決之希望、蓋衆知一旦戰事結束、中國恢復潛能力必甚偉大、此乃觀於中國大使館所發表之最近關稅統計、而允可見者也、據此統計、一九三九年之中國收入、較諸上年眞正减少之數、在比較上殊爲有限、金融界許多人士、前預料中國收入大减者、今覺中國許多貿易口岸雖已關閉、然中國尢能得此巨額關稅、則貿易狀况一旦如常、中國在商業上定能有使人驚異之康復、（五日路透社電）</p>
<h3>佛敎訪緬團　卓著成效　全緬僧民極欣洽</h3>

<h3>羅斯福演詞　柏林反感　指為削弱美中立</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹　此間「電聞報」柏林訪常稱、德國政界認羅斯福總統於美國會開幕時所發演詞、自始至終抨擊德國、且以爲美總統已减弱美國之中立態度、而美國海長愛狄生建議以若干種工業置於國家直接管理下一說、可謂上述意見之佐證、查美政府前於一九一七年美國將參戰時、曾獲相同之權力、一般人雖明瞭若謂美國此項步驟爲擬參加歐戰之微象、固屬失當、但德人對於美國在一切情勢中續守巾立之信心、今已减退云、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　美國羅斯福總統於三日向國會發表之演說、此間政界人士並不感覺驚異、渠等宣稱、此項演詞對於美國政策之趨向及美國總統之態度、並未有新穎之說明、渠等對於此項演詞、提出兩點加以評論、（一）羅斯福提及征服之方式、與現代文明不能相容、並提及强國對小國之威脅、（二）美園對於歐戰之態度、</p>

<h3>羅斯福預算案　國會中遇難關　徵收新稅多數不表贊同　將組特別委會研究辦法</h3>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統所提預算甲所增之新國防稅、國會方面對之極爲冷淡、據參院財政委員會主席哈禮遜稱、「籌措美令四六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、其事非易、余對此項增稅案不敢贊同」、故主張由國曾叫度支委員會組織特別聯席委員會研究其是否得當、衆院度支委員會各委員對於增稅辦法、亦多不表贊許、唯財部對於籌款万而能提示辦法、則國會願加考慮、吾則國認爲此四六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇美金、應由他項支出項下扣出、不應另增新稅、（五日合衆社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統今日提交國會教至一九四一年六月底止之一年預算案、載有大增美國國防經費之項目、佔計支出爲八·四二四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、收入爲六·二四八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、不足二·一七六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇、查上次預算不足之數爲三·九三三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、總統主張微收新稅四六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、使不足之數减爲一·七一六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、估計國防以外之各種救濟事業將用一·三〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、農業九〇〇〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、公共工程與投資一·一〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、恩給金一·二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、公債利息一·一〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、各行政部一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、關於國防估計一項、下屆較本屆增三〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、羅斯福總統謂觀於世界現狀、此項經費乃維持尋常國防凖備與緊要支出所必要、雖預算案對於國防經費增加不少、然其他支出則力事撙節、續增的捐稅係以來年國防經費之需要爲根據、聯邦政府之信用以今日爲最高云、總統檢討其</p>
<p>財政政策　謂運用政府基金以鼓勵私人事業、在政府與私人收入上咸大有影響、叫年來國家收入已增百分之六九、此爲在歷史中同一時期內之最高增加、救濟事業之經費、宜以實在需要爲限、但若目前希望不獲實現、則稍緩不妨對此估計予以修正、人有指摘公債者、須知政府已設有或購置耐久而顯著之資產、不過此種資產、迄未編冊耳、以言</p>
<p>國防經費　其中有陸軍建造費、如夏威夷建築營房需款一·二六四·〇〇〇元即其一也云、總統雖未將如何徵集國防新稅之方法吿知國會、惟謂當遵守量力微稅之原則、並力避可减低銷費者購買力之捐稅云、衆信總統此言、含有不增收國產稅、但增高所得稅之意、羅斯福總統後以海軍經常預算案送交國會、計九〇四·五〇〇·〇〇〇元、較上年的增一八三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、總統謂加以某種緊急工作等之額外費用、</p>
<p>海軍預算　總額將爲一·二二四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、所增加者大都用於造艦、除規定繼續一百二十艘之工程外、渠請國會核准經費以建造戰艦兩艘·飛機母艦一艘·巡洋艦兩艘·驅逐艦八艘·潛艇六艘·潛艇供應艦一艘·海上飛機供應艦三艘·與掃雷艦一艘云、按此兩戰艦係五年內所造之第丸艦與第十艦、其噸數尙未公布、惟海軍部準備六萬五千噸之戰艦、海軍預算案規定海軍將士十四萬五千人陸戰隊一一萬五千人、陸軍預算案主張以一·〇〇七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元爲陸軍與空軍經費、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>此外總統幷謂、下年度預算案父包　（一）臨時國防費三〇二·一五一·〇〇〇美元、用以充實美洲大陸中立區域」及美國海岸之防務、幷加强淸四謀工作、（二）美洲各國邦交促進費二九一·九八〇美元、（三）建造橫貫美洲大陸之公路籌備費四〇·〇〇〇美元云（叫日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>中國推行義敎概况（二）</h3>
<p>（二）沿革史略</p>
<p>我國推行義敎、自淸季開始、章則巳相常具備、惟徒託空言、未見實施、民國成立、確定義務爲四年，並於民國四年頒布籌備義務敎育命令、訂定義敎施行程序三十一條、民國九年、復訂定推行義敎辦法、規定自民國十年開始、至十七年辦理完成、並設義敎實旅研究會、以資研究、惟終因軍閥常國、內亂不息、籌措經費、亦無一定辦法、致未能切實施行、抬國府成立後、前大學院於民國十七年根據第一次全國敎育會議之決議、通令各省市組織義教委員會、異助敎育行政機關、推行義務敎育、十八年、中國國民黨第三决全國代表大會、有厲行義教之決議、同年第三屆中央執委會二次全體大會、並決議厲行强迫敎育、責由訓練部會同敎部制定計劃規程與實施程序、限於二十三年底實現、敎部遂根據此案、制定實施義敎初步計劃、對於中央省地方分担義敎經費之支配師資之培養及校舍之擴充等、均經分別規定、十九年第二次全國教育會議、、並擬定實施義敎方案、除義敎年限仍定爲四年外、貧寒兒童得變通或縮短在學期間、嗣敎部以全國兒童數僅佔學齡兒童總數百分之二一點八、義敎推行未免遲緩、因於二十一年六月、頒佈短期義教辦法大綱、令飭各省市擬具計劃分區實騐、先後將計劃報部備案者、共有十八省市、此爲我國推行義務敎育之嚆矢、是項短期義務敎育、計經三年之久、尙未能推行盡利、嗣乃根據五中全會決議、重訂實施義務敎育暫行辦法大綱、於二十四年五月二十八日提經行政院會議通過後、頒布施行、除由部另訂施行細則令飭各省市籌措經費、擬具計劃、積極實施外，中央復籌撥鉅款、補助各省市，我國推行義務敎育、至是乃由提倡而至開始實施時期、</p>
<p>（三）分期推行計劃</p>
<p>民國二十四年所訂實施義務敎育計劃、蓋有鑒於經費籌措之不易、因規定分期推進辦法、先辦一年制及二年制短期小學、逐漸達於四年制初級小學、其實施程序定爲三期、</p>
<p>甲·第一期、自二十四年八月起、至二十九年七月止、各省市廣設一年制短期小學、招收九足歲至十二足歲之失學兒童、施以一年義務敎育、此外並推廣初級小學、充實小學原有學級學額、厲行二部制、改良私塾，試行巡廻敎學、務使至本期終了時、全國曾受一年以上相當敎育之兒童、至少達到學齡兒童總數百分之八十以上、</p>

<p>丙·第三期、自民國三十三年八月起、應將所有二年制短期小學、均逐漸改爲叫年制之小學、務使全國學齡兒童、至少均受四年義務敎育、是項計劃確定後、凡與計劃相關之一切法令、如義務敎育暫行辦法大綱施行細則、市縣劃分小學區辦法、調查學齡兒童辦法、實施二部制辦法、實旅巡迥敎育辦法、改良私塾辦法、一年制短期小學規程、二年制短期小學規程、全國義務敎育委員會組織規程、省市義務敎育視導員規程、縣市義務敎育視導員規程等、均經先後訂定、公佈施行、義務敎育實施計劃、於以丈備、</p>
<p>値此抗戰建劃期間、鑒於推行義務敎育允為基本事業、亟應加緊辦理、爰於本年通飭各省提前設立二年制短期小學、並擬訂第二期推行義務敎育計劃、務期普及義務敎育、能於規定期間內從速完成、以鞏固抗戰建國之基礎、最近中央復頒佈縣各級組織網要、規定依照保甲、每保設一保國民學校、每一鄉「鎭」設一中心學校、使義務敎育興民衆敎育、同時推行、並實行政敎合一、以加强推進力量、而迅速完成基層政治文化經濟之建設、</p>

<p>上海市各界康恥運動委員會為粵北我軍大捷、電賀最高統帥暨前敵將士云、中央黨部國民政府鈞鑒、并轉前敵將士勛鑒、此次日軍乘我軍在桂積極反攻之際、抽調精銳、猛攻粵漢南段、希圖牽制我方兵力、挽回其湘北潰敗之恥、賴我最高統帥指揮若定、戰略如神、前方將士、一致用命、造成湘北大捷以後第二之光榮戰蹟、喜訊傳來、歡騰萬狀、本會同人、除策動全滬市民、砥礪志節、昌明康恥、　為恢盾、以期再接再厲、掃蕩羣魔、達到最後勝利之目的外、肅電致敬、并祝成功、上海市各界廉恥運動委員會叩歌、</p>
<p>統一各債　價格飛騰</p>
<p>財政部維持債信始終不變、對於關稅担保之統各債、雖因稅收被截被迫停付、但為由中中交農四行貼現付款、統一之甲乙丙丁戊五種債票、第八次還本付息、已定　月三三十日一付款、至於上海證券暗由、因政府維持債信始終如一、且八次還本付息將屆、同時粵北華軍吿捷、市塲人心至為興奮、於是公債買氣大盛、價格飛漲、茲錄昨日上下午收盤行市如下、統一甲種上午六十元零六角、下午六十元零八角、乙種上午五十一元三角半、下午五十元八角、丙種上午四十九元二角五分、下午四十九元五角、丁種上午四十八元一角五分、下午四十八元三角、戊種上午四十八元八角五分、下午四十九元、價格之飛漲、實為近來所罕見、</p>
<p>日軍當局　承認挫敗</p>
<p>五日法文上海日報載、聞昨在日方新聞報導席上、由日軍當局發言人談在廣東之日軍、均巳達到目的、此目的為何、蓋即破瓖一切華人所有防禦工事、依該發言人之表示、否認日軍在粵北慘敗之說、但稱、日軍在「戰勝」之後、又復「自動退守」若干戰略據點耳、該發言人最後又言、日軍現在作戰之目的、不在佔地、僅在消耗華軍云、</p>

<h3>滬上貧窮福星　善團趕辦冬振　在龍門路散放麵包薑湯　在徐家涯擬舉辦庇寒所</h3>
<p>自從冬至前後、二次寒浪來襲、又凍死百餘人之後、（實際上恐尚不止此數）滬上慈善界人士、深為注意、來報即土張辦理者振庇寒所及平糶、救濟飢寒交迫之窮黎、茲聞上海慈善團體聯合會方面、業已着手進行關於煮振及庇賽所各事煮振因需</p>
<p>廣大傷所</p>
<p>以目前上海租界內空地需求之殷切、無可覓得適宜地點、故已決定改辦一種類於煮振之辦法、於晚間擇地散給每人</p>
<p>麵包兩個</p>
<p>熱薑湯一碗、俾得禦寒、聞巳擇定龍門路一帶為散給之所、每晚即在該處舉行、定於一月九日（舊曆十二月初一日）開辦、薑湯即由仁濟育嬰堂代辦、麵包亦向作塲定製、並由捕房屆時</p>
<p>派捕照料</p>
<p>維持秩序、庇寒所地點之難覓、更較粥廠為不易、只有徐家匯天主堂附近尚有廠棚兩所、業由黃涵之·聞蘭亭·關炯之·三君、函商該堂鐘神父、昨日又由朱志堯君前往接洽、一俟接洽就緒、</p>
<p>即行舉辦</p>
<p>好在只有三個月工夫、大地回春、天氣融和、便行遺散、想法捕房方面、亦必樂於贊助也、常為救濟所不及而生活實際上大感痛苦者、則為　及</p>
<p>體面隱貧</p>
<p>此輩常為夫業或食指繁重、入不敷出、或貧病交加、所受飢寒苦况、不亞於道路流離之窮氓、現聞該會極關切隱貧之救濟、正在設法無使凍餒、造福之大、與救濟</p>
<p>一般窮黎</p>
<p>等耳、滬上窮黎衆多、救濟經費所需甚、開辦之初、雖就該會節餘經費項下動支、此項經費之來源、黃涵之氏嘗謂平日</p>
<p>各方開支</p>
<p>多所核减、叢怨積毀、而今得有此類辦理冬振、中心良慰、惟是事鉅款絀、若不有捐款接濟、仍恐維持匪易、所幸滬上儘多樂善好施人士、對於此屆冬振、定多慷慨解囊、以助其成也、</p>

<p>繼續電訂洋米調節</p>
<p>民食調節協會辦理代訂洋米登記後、各團體機關公司廠號、中請訂米登記者甚為踴躍、該會除已向西貢電訂、號貢米六百噸外、即約次電至西貢續訂洋米、數量由採購委員會决定之、至於上海豆米行業公會之茶會市塲、因洋米連日湧到、月國米來源已疏通、於是上海兩租界內存米漸增、米價已穩定、</p>

<h3>油市　連油已到　生油因之見軟</h3>
<p>昨日油市、塲中充滿不景氣象、豆油全日無交易、因大連來豆油昨已有一批抵埠、數約一千二三百桶、（一說一千八百桶）、致人心頓受打擊、刻下希望該埠源源放行、孤島民衆或可寬舒、但昨市因賣方成本昂貴、尚不願輕脫、所以擯持未開、花生油因之見軟、且港帮辦胃亦觀望、統祇做開江北生油十桶、價九十七元、比上日市跌三元、青島生油三十桶、價為原盤一百零三元、</p>
<h3>糧食　米糧到源不弱　仍須遶道虹口</h3>
<p>米糧昨日內地來源、南港等早晚稻、續有千餘包、運達虹口、他如蘇嘉路一帶之貨尚乏到頭、惟聞經租界當局一再交涉、某方亦將於最短期內有再施開放照舊搬運之說、因某方此次所搜括之米糧為數已鉅、暫時弛放、事或可能、尤予某方以打擊、則內地農民寗可儲榖、待需用時、出豐數担、不願多躍、故掠奪較難、另一方面洋米抵埠絡繹不絕、而輕調節會等續訂之貨、亦屬不鮮、所以市塲人心、已無堅持之意、均在謀脫手、久乏出樣之各貨、亦已在市兜售、銷爽自　昨午市度轉爽後、早市開手、本鄉店胃即續活動、不過吃盤不鬆、市面無所變化、直至近午又忽有整數交易、乃形勢漸見熱鬧、喊聲逐昂、卒以市貨擁擠、不易提足、故結果銷塲雖佳、全市統計不下萬餘包、而收盤行情無論粳尖國米及洋米等價、僅好一角至二三角而已、若常崑高粳仍為四十元外、南港早晚稻亦祇三十六元半、三十六元、西貢三十六元半、三十六元三角半、碎米三十二元三角、次貨二十九元八角、餘價情形亦屬相彷耳、看價目欄、</p>
<p>洋米昨以本街舖作趁小吸收、市形轉呈活潑、且一號西貢定價仍須四十六元三四角、與市上回籠價四十五元相差元外、故前後三四批電報均未妥交、惟碎西貢昨又訂妥五百噸、價三十四元八角、即裝約二十前到滬、現貨售開四千包之譜、一號西貢大至三十六元七角半、次三十五元半、碎米三十二元二角至三十元〇六角、均比前日回二三角云、</p>
<p>洋米昨日又到三千七百九十八包、係太古公司山東輪、由香港運來、聞日內有某法輪、自西貢直接裝來大批洋米、確數須俟該輪到滬續報、</p>
<h3>粉麥均轉定局　青島幫動辦下脚粉</h3>
<p>麺粉　日昨二號粉廠盤、續開九元原價、其漲風已漸平息、查本街零銷、以廠盤驟加三角、進意不免較遜、而客盤已達九元五角、客帮進胃亦不十分貪取、故青島帮注意取辦下脚粉、成交約有二萬餘包、計開藍炮車八元四角、紅桃花八元九角、阜豐白袋粉七元、及回籠車船牌粉九百四角半至二角、日廠粉經前日一度興奮後、昨市交易亦轉怠懈、一月份鳳凰牌有浮多回出、開價僅九元零五六分、後市復昂至九元一角、比前日已回小角許、查麺粉今有八千三百包、運往天津、又有三千包、運往香港、</p>
<p>小麥　昨小麥市况、亦轉定勢、查蘇錫一帶、雖有零星抵埠、為數殊屬不多、貨方均以產價昂貴、及運輸困難、不願輕易求脫、而廠方以本麥供給、旣不足恃、業已數度訂購洋麥、但定麥雖經宣佈、而本麥尚不願貶價求脫、結果常錫蘇管各麥均開十五元五角、及鎮江麥十五元三角、由福新廠辦去六千包、阜豐廠辦去四千包、市面已入醖釀狀態中、</p>
<h3>紗花　多頭出籠　棉紗又起跌風</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、且跌風又起、此因匯兌續見放長、而鬆勢尤烈、致人心渙散、同時實需依然不振、且大數投機家視外匯新年開出看縮、目前非但不緊、反見鬆懈、大所失望、又有一說、廠方頗有開紗心思、由此一來、多頭暫見灰心、將手貨紛紛吐出而了結、市態乃愈形軟化、惟原棉情况依然挺秀、查棉紗昨出寗波來五百件、今有一千二百五十七係運天津、又五十五件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、承上日之虛氣續進、且塲中買者缺乏、而賣者反增、故叫喊聲勢亦不及上日之健、於此一般搶檯面之流、變一反見搶賣出帽子、開盤雖做七百四十八元、比上日跌五元半、少頃聞外匯開出續見放長、賣風陡盛、市盤直下挫、跌至七百三十五元、迨至收盤時、聞匯票微縮、空頭又活動抵補、再昂一些、查半日間成交統計一千九百〇五包、行情二十支雙馬跌十二元半、雙地球跌十五元、天女跌十六元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、五〇〇　香港三三〇</p>
<p>內地　四〇　南洋　一五</p>
<p>湖南　二〇　統計一、九〇五</p>
<h3>紗銷不暢　棉花交易轉淡</h3>
<p>本棉交易、轉趨岑寂、同行互相買賣亦不及上日之熱鬧、此因外棉雖平靜、跌風未起、無奈現紗銷路不暢、廠胃尚滯、人心硬中帶軟矣、蘇北來源計通花一千〇十一包、又由北沙來二千六百七十八包、茲將現棉情形如左、</p>
<p>火草包　一六二·〇〇　同行進　七四七包</p>
<p>南太　一六四·〇〇　同行進　三〇一包</p>
<p>火草包　一六六·五〇　肇興進　三四五包</p>
<p>通州　一四·〇〇　同行進　一〇〇包</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初仍因海外棉商之購買而價激漲、續後因南方之套賣及空頭之活躍、市况因而轉疲、結果收盤價格較之上日跌三五磅音、印度連同預測漲五羅比餘埃及跌四五十磅音、利物浦漲十餘　士、</p>
<p>滬　外棉、日來又因匯兌之彩長、各方謠言紛起、本埠各種棉價、俱反漲為跌、因之交易殊為　寂、廠方亦以紗價不振、對於原棉採辦抱觀望態度、日方　商亦然、茲將昨日棉市以美匯八元折合送廠價如下、</p>

<h3>南北貨　山楂片轉降</h3>
<p>山楂片近到三四百件、市勢轉軟、昨水菓帮開出凈貨百數件、三十三元半、此前降三元許、毛貨堅持三十元、尚未成盤</p>
<h3>海味　胡椒價疲</h3>
<p>胡椒近去化漸趨靜寂、市態回軟、且外匯放長、合價較宜、亦一原因也、昨一號黑椒行盤售九十元、黑大椒九十二元、文島白椒一百五十五元、荷蘭又一百四十二元、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<p>小談</p>
<h3>談甚麼？</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>「你編自由談？那麽你的自由談要談點甚麽呢？」</p>
<p>曉得一定有人要這麼問，還是自己先在這裏表白幾句吧。</p>
<p>顧名思議，一個副刊而名爲「自由談」，當然是隨便談談，甚麼都要談的意思。可是有一句話亟想在這裏聲明一下的：自由談决不是瞎三話四，自由談更不是胡說八道。</p>
<p>我們知道我們所處身的是社會，我們所過渡的人生，因此我們所將注重的，也就是社會與人生。我們希望自由談多少能供給生活上所需要的智識，能提高社會上一般的趣味，能增加人生的樂趣，能發揚世界的光明。</p>
<p>在宇宙中，人類是一種渺小的生物，可是並不是廢物。我們如果能好好地利用自己的力量，是可以創造許多幸福的；反之，我們也能製造許多災患。</p>
<p>我們對於自由談也是這樣的看法。自由談是一塊小小的園地，可是繁榮與荒蕪，盡在人爲。我們希望自由談能成爲每個讀者的心靈上憩息之地。</p>
<p>我們承認我們與任何別人一樣，也有我們的偏見與弱點，祇是我們願意以最虛心的態度，去接受任何善意的批評與指示。我們願意盡我們的心力，去掃除世界上的無知，迷信，與黑暗的勢力，幹這做不完的工作。我們希望我們能站在開明的思想，眞理的追求，自由的發展，以及光明的創造這一面。我們的最後目標，是使這個世界成爲大多動人的更合理的，更美好的，更快樂的世界。</p>
<p>因此，從今天起，自由談最低限度的要求是：</p>
<p>不作無病之呻吟，不寫害人的文章。</p>
<p>思想</p>
<h3>人權宣言</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉德</p>
<p>英國現代大思想家威爾期（H.G.Wells）最近和幾位朋友合作起草一篇「人權宜言」，以書信的方式在倫敦泰唔士報上發表。內容略謂：</p>
<p>「每個人均有獲得滋養料，住處，醫藥和看護的權利。他有權獲得充分的敎育，使他成爲關心公衆事務的有用公民。他和他的私人財產應受警察和法律的保障。對於困迫他或傷害他的任何　言或誹請，他應</p>
<p>應該獲得充分的保護。他可以陸意日由從事任何正當的職業。他司以自費在世界各處隨意走動。他有做買賣的權利。他如果未曾被控犯法，不該受三星期以上的監禁，如果未受法庭公開審問，不該受三個月以上的監禁；有精神病的合法證明者不在此例。一個人除非自己表示同意，不該受任何停止生育機能的手術。他如果過着監禁生活，不該受過度的靜默，聲響，光綫或黑暗的威脅，以致引起精神上的苦楚。他如果自願禁食或絕食，人家不該强迫他吃東西，也不該阻止他挨餓。他如果犯軍罪，所應受的極度刑罰是十五年以下的有期徒刑或死刑。本宜言中所包含的條款和原則應於法典上詳細規定。本宣言包括過去各種關係人權的宣言，今後應該成爲全世界人類的根本法律。」</p>
<p>又是甚麼烏托邦，理想國嗎？不是。這篇宣言的要點，在過去其他關係人權的宣言裏，大概已經有過。這裏所提三的是每個人類最低限度所應該享有的權利。可是今日世界許多現代國家中的男女公民，由他們的政府獲得甚麼樣的待遇呢？那種違反人道，剝削人權的行爲所造成的可扼腕的現象，是觸目驚心的，是令人不勝悲　的。</p>
<p>威爾斯先生已經替人類杜會定下一些根本的原則了。當籠罩着世界的戰爭和騷亂的暗雲消散了的時候，當各民放以人類文化而不以暴力爲解决困難和糾紛的根據的時候，我們希望這些根本的原則會在世界各國普遍地應川起來。我們希望威爾斯先生所提出的方略會傳播到各地去，各學校都採爲敎材，人人都把它拿去讀一讀。我們希望這些根本的原則會在每個人的心坎裏生長起來，像靑翠的草木朝着陽光而生長起來一樣。</p>

<h3>二次歐戰第一年　巴黎倫敦聖誔風景</h3>
<p>— 史弢</p>
<p>歐洲大戰的爆發，到如今已馳過幾個月頭了，一切都好似十分沉寂的，雖然德國的浮動水雷是那樣活躍着，但馬奇諾和齊格非兩防綫依舊是冷淸得令人不能置信。英國飛機發散宣傳紙代替轟炸，德國更在法國前綫贈洋傘給張伯倫，經濟戰爭是近代戰爭的特點，這一句話又在第二次歐戰中漸漸地顯露出來，在戰時體制下，英法的人士都迎接着這大戰第一年的聖誔。一艘的想像中，他們該是度着十分憂悒，恐怖的生活吧，然而不，聖誕是快樂的，聖誕終於在他們的心田里抹上一層融樂的色彩。</p>
<p>狂歡如故的巴黎</p>
<p>法國人對於前綫的戰事，似乎是怪淡泊的，他們認爲全體國民的經濟戰比什麽都重要，在前綫間直找不出大書特書的記事，後方呢，則不斷地在計劃使日常生活正常化起來，他們的心里都貼着『解消非常時』「正常化」一類的標語。</p>
<p>所以戰時的聖誕節也跟平時一樣，沒有什麽特別的地方；大街上熱鬧地排列着露天的小店，那里有許多使人唾涎欲滴的火鷄，味美色艷的葡萄酒，這些食物正像飛一般地被路人買去，巴黎的市街到處都呈顯着快樂，熱鬧的現象。</p>
<p>吃，喝，跳舞，這三件事是法國聖誔節時時的唯一點綴，許多戰士得到特許，從那陰慘的前綫回到花一般的巴黎來了，他們愉快地帶着妻女行樂着。這些前綫請假　來的戰士，雖是在假期中，但在出外的時候，仍不能够脫去他們的制服，所以今年巴黎聖誕節的特徵，就是各處舞塲，飯店里充塞着軍服的姿態。</p>
<p>自從戰爭開始以來，巴黎最熱鬧的塲所，是到午后十一時爲止的，但現在已發出佈吿，從聖誕之夜起延長到十二時才關門。巴黎人都不愛在家中慶祝聖誕，他們有出外與人同慶聖誕的習慣，所以酒館，飯店等地方，都很快地全部預定一空。那一天，市內的版店里，泛濫着一羣羣男女老幼，飲着美酒，嚼着佳希，享受着人生的樂趣，縱使是在戰時，那里的人還是能够隨心所欲地吃着喝着，巴黎，眞不愧是遊樂的大都市。</p>
<p>這一方面是因爲馬奇諾防綫固若金湯的綠故，另一方面又是在證明戰時法國的國民經濟是那般健全着；但是從外表上看來，巴黎可已消失在黑暗中了，絲亳找不出她的形影，法國雖說是在那在歡的佳節，也考慮到德國空軍的空襲，因此燈火的管制依然嚴格地實行着。夜晚的街道是一片黑暗，可是一踏進門口，那里仍是輝煌的燈火，溫柔的暖氣，並且還有豐富的酒看等候着你去享受。戲劇，音樂，電影…都在黑暗中演奏。今年巴黎的聖誕，外觀果然有苦悶的缺憾了，但是內部却仍是那樣燦然的。</p>
<p>沒有孩子的倫敦</p>
<p>要在燈火管制的夜里，迎接聖誕佳節，這該是第一次世界大戰時也未曾有過的事吧！『讓我們暫時忘却了戰爭，跟平時一樣快樂地度那聖誕節吧。」在不知不覺間，英國國民默默地浮起了這一種情感，街上充滿着聖誕的風景，一部分西部前綫的英國兵，在聖誕前二天，已急忽忽踏上歸國的旅程，一個個歸返他們所憶戀的故鄕了。海軍和空軍的士兵，也有一部份休假，倫敦每個百貨商店，正如去年一般地生意興降，劇塲，飯店，夜總會等娛樂塲所，仍是全部客滿的盛况。鐵路當局爲便利聖誕假期內旅行者起見，也增加了列車的班次誔，是孩子們最快樂的一天，可是倫敦，有三十萬兒童各各分散到避難區去了，聖誕老人爲了安慰返抵避難區的孩子起見，比往年早一些去訪問他們，孩子們的雙親拿了聖誕禮物乘着專車到避難區去，和孩子們度一個提早舉行的聖誕節而歸來，當局向孩子們的雙親說：『不管孩子們啼哭不休，也不能帶他們到倫敦方面來的！」所以聖誕節的倫敦，始終找不出一個小孩的影子。</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>做人的權利</h3>
<p>— 嘉音</p>
<p>一條小生命從呱呱墮地的時候起，本來就應該算是一個人了。做人的權利原可說是天賦的。可是不幸得很，事實上並不是這樣。爲了現社會制度的不合理，生活在世界上的不幸的多數人，不斷地要受飢寒交迫的威脅，受惡劣環境的壓迫，受黑暗勢力的凌虐。在這個畸形的社會中，有些人簡直得不到生存的權利，得不到公平與合法的待遇，這是一件多麽値得悲痛的事啊。</p>
<p>在歷史上，曾經有過不少前進的思想家，定下了做人所應享受的權利，現在威爾斯等把他們的意見歸納起來，又參加了些新的意見，草成這篇「人權宣言」，是很値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>人類正在向開明的歷史途中邁進着。我們希望，也相信有一天，每個人都會有做人的權利。</p>
<h3>談片</h3>
<p>— 史丁</p>
<p>據合衆社消息，美國紐的港的碼頭，軍火由積，預備運到歐洲去給協的國，價値的爲一千八百五十萬美金。在美國軍火商滿意的笑聲中，我們彷彿聽見了歐洲民間婦女的哀啼。</p>
<p>氣候嚴寒，滬西一日間發現孩屍六十七具之多。苦命的小生命，你們現在該是比挨飢忍餓地活着的時候幸福得多吧。</p>
<p>歐局瞬息千變，德國投機的商人發明了活葉地圖，以便隨時更換邊界，眞是別出心裁的識時務者。</p>
<p>敦倫的巴西總領事華士康賽羅在歡送巴西駐英大使席上說：「國際刑法的需要，莫過於今日。侵略者對殘暴事件應負直接的責任，猶如殺人犯應負其咎一樣。對於發動這種大災難的首兇，我們唯有一法司以應付，就是發動多數人的力量，驅逐侵略者；由愛好和平的國家的警察，出面干涉。』假如事實上辦得到的話，誰不贊成呢？</p>

<h3>梨園舊話</h3>
<p>— 吳公壽</p>
<p>前輩評劇家孫玉聲氏（別署海上漱石生，已故，曾爲余述「梨園掌故」十餘則，極有價値。茲錄二則於后</p>
<p>（一）私房行頭始於周李</p>
<p>伶人搭班演戲，不論生旦凈丑，所有衣飾一切，都由班中供給。故大衣箱，二衣箱，旗袍箱，靶子箱內，諸包悉備，以憑演員取用。即使頭等名角，亦無所謂私房行頭也。遜淸光緒中葉，周鳳林在大新街開丹桂桐記茶園，周係著名花旦，欲炫耀衣飾，得以叫座，特製行頭甚多，然所置有者，班內旦角，都可公用，非個人獨專也。乃創立私房名目，其資不出公賬，由彼解囊，於是他人祇能自行購備。旦角界遂開私房行頭之先。李春來在大新街開春仙茶園效之。而武生界乃亦紛紛自備，漸至老生老旦小生等角，凡包銀在二三百元以　者，爲登台時美觀計，莫不各製若干。從此相習成風，劇台上遂現錦簇花團之觀。而角兒則因多此一筆開支，俗言羊毛出在羊身包銀遂愈增愈大</p>
<p>（二）小奎官非科班出身</p>
<p>梨園中凈角一項，人才最爲難得，旣應聲音宏亮，須體格魁梧，更宜功架威武，跌撲矯健，槍刀純熟。故京徽班之凈角，分爲銅鎚·架子·武二花等。如演各戲，其有一人能兼此數長者，昔惟大奎官翹然特出，以是得享盛名；繼之者有小奎官，雖銅鎚架子戲較遜，而跌撲由爲俗伶所不能及，惟其人非科班出身，相傳素業皮匠，息擔於石路天仙茶園之門，與園中人因是相稔，暇必入園觀劇，有志學習，後拜大奎官爲師，得共薪傳。第武工練自半途，與自幼苦習者有異，故每演白水灘飾靑而虎，赤身跌摔克子，兩肘跟必致破裂，血痕殷然。翌日再摔，復如之。人詢其有無痛楚。則彼以積久不知爲對。嘻，是豈不知痛楚哉！欲努力演劇，故不得不然耳。</p>
<p>游踪藝</p>
<h3>原藝</h3>
<p>— 小田（一）</p>
<p>孔子曰，志於道，據於德，依於仁，游於藝，此夫子誨弟子進德修業之法，足見藝術於人生的重要，就是聖人也不曾忽視他。學記說游字有不迫遽之意，我認爲這見解很對，不要說從事於藝術的修養學習，就是看看戲聽聽音樂，倘若沒有從容閒暇的時間和心境，也不能領略着藝術的好處。</p>
<p>這是一樁很詫異的事情，世人對於「藝人」和「藝員」這兩個名詞，好像很有些軒輊似的，其實譬如說「特派專員」和「特派專人」，父有什麼分別呢。通常伶界中人，都稱謂藝員，可是大多數藝員，對於本身的藝術，能够達到嫻熟而不逾規矩的地步，已經少見；若要說得上精通二字，那眞好比鳳毛麟角了。原因是他們祇知道某戲應該怎麼演唱，而不知道爲什麼要這樣演唱，所謂知其然而不知其所以然，所以他們能够循規蹈矩率由舊章的演唱，倒還聽得下去，若要花樣翻新一知半解地仟意改作一下，　直令人毛骨悚然。大概是因爲藝員的名詞太濫的緣故，所以新興的話劇和電影從業員，都稱謂藝人。的確，藝人是大半受過相當敎育的，彷彿銀行員和錢莊職員，從事的職業雖然相類，社會的眼光，就不免有些判別。</p>
<p>從前孔孟荀卿，稱謂儒家，老莊列子，稱謂道家；墨子兼愛，是爲墨家；尹文子正名，是爲名家；法家則管仲發其端，韓非集其成；兵家則先有孫武，後有吳起；他們都能發揮自己的主張，著書立說，根據所以然的原理，指陳當然的行為，這都是値得後人欽仰的。我說能夠澈底明瞭蕶術原理的人，可稱曰藝術家。藝術家可就與藝人和藝員不同了，要有聰明的頭腦，好學不倦的精神，博採精思，他不但要曉得應該怎樣，要曉得爲什麼要這樣，必定要曉得爲什麼要這樣，才能够曉得這樣對不對，不對當然要改，就是本來不錯，因爲遷就某種條件，所以要換一個方法，所換的方法，也必定要合乎所以然的原理。在中國，在現代，我以爲很需要藝術家。</p>

<h3>孫佐臣四把胡琴之出處（下）</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>至晚年在滬，落魄不得志，此琴又啞不成聲，後爲薜君携去。（薛君名斌，無錫富商薛保潤第四子），新篁一琴，孫氏於民國十三年以十三元購於北平，新製品也，故可名曰新篁，聞亦在薛君手；瘦鶴一琴，通身瘦長，音若鶴唳，軸子因年歲久遠，密切處已磨細，欲斷，今在吾友錢君處，孫氏生前感其優待而贈之者；吾時過其寓，從壁上摘下，漫撫一曲，其聲淸越，與吾藏孫琴之丹鳳相等；吾之丹鳳琴，乃孫氏歿時造囑其子送來者，詳於拙作「得琴記」中，曾載本報，茲不贅。此琴何以名曰丹鳳，爲其通身之竹皆紅紫色，而其聲音又屬陽也，「丹鳳朝陽」此琴似之，桿子粗大而筒子小而扁圓，異於凡琴，孫氏在日，每奏此琴，若萬馬奔騰，若風爾驟至，又若旭日高升，炎炎之光，照滿乾坤六合，故名曰丹鳳也。或曰係其師賈三名麗春者之琴，約閱八十餘年矣，惜吾手不勁，藝不高，雖存吾齋，有如明珠暗投耳。然倘遇慷慨淋漓之歌，則此琴聲音之悲狀，若酒樓雪滿之夜，而逢帶劍之俠士，其快朗固可喜也。酒醉寫此，益懷想孫氏不置，吾將求名手刻「孫氏丹鳳之琴」於其上，以紀念之，且令百年而後，得此琴者知其貴重焉，民國二十九年元旦記。</p>

<h3>Northern Bank of Yong River, Chinese Troops Fiercely Attack the Japanese Army Along the Yongqin Road, Recovering Important Strongholds such as Pu Temple. The Japanese Army Collapses. Guangdong Northern Chinese Troops Press Towards Yuan Tan, Enveloping the Japanese Troops.</h3>
<p>Guilin: Chinese troops on the northern bank of the Yong River have been fiercely attacking the Japanese army along the Yongqin Road for days. On the 3rd, they recovered two important strongholds, Pu Temple and Nabian, seizing a large amount of spoils. On the morning of the 4th, the Japanese launched a large-scale counterattack with reinforcements. After the Chinese troops bravely attacked, fierce fighting continued until 1 PM, when the entire Japanese front collapsed. The pursuit is still ongoing. (Dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: On the 4th, Chinese troops near Kunlun Pass discovered another Japanese army ammunition cellar, seizing twelve Japanese field guns, eight anti-tank guns, dozens of packages of documents, and many other munitions and military supplies. (Dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Shaoguan: The Japanese army retreating towards southern Guangdong suffered heavy casualties due to intense ambushes by Chinese troops along the way. They are now being encircled by Chinese troops in various places and will be annihilated without difficulty. (Dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Shaoguan: A portion of the northern Guangdong Chinese troops pressed near Yuan Tan on the evening of the 3rd. Another elite force outflanked the Japanese rear, launching an attack from all sides. The fighting was extremely fierce, with heavy Japanese casualties. By dawn on the 5th, the remaining Japanese troops broke through and fled.

<h3>Military Situation of the Anti-Japanese War in Jiangxi in the Past Year</h3>
<p>Ji'an: In the past year, in the military situation of the anti-Japanese war in Jiangxi, the people and the military cooperated to fight fiercely, and the Japanese suffered heavy losses, showing signs of exhaustion. In late March, the Japanese deployed the ×× two divisions to meet in Hefei and Nanchang. This was the prelude to the first battle in the 28th year. After a bloody battle for ten days, the Japanese (China Dispatch Army) suffered more than 30,000 casualties, including four dead regimental commanders and many battalion commanders. The only price they paid was an empty city. Afterwards, a part of the Japanese army invaded Gao'an to the west, and a part attacked Wuning fiercely, attempting to threaten Changsha. As a result, they were severely attacked by the Chinese army in the Mufu Mountain area. Two Japanese regimental commanders have been killed. It is commendable that Gao'an has been won and lost twice, and more than 3,000 Japanese troops have been annihilated in the battle for the city. In April, the Chinese army fiercely attacked Nanchang, entering the old and new airfields and reaching Zhongshan Road. More than a thousand soldiers destroyed Japanese military equipment, inflicting a major blow on the Japanese army in terms of morale, causing them to lie dormant in a corner, not daring to take a step beyond the boundaries. By the end of September, the Japanese army launched a large-scale attack on Hunan, and the Japanese army invading from western Jiangxi was intercepted into several sections in Shangfu Luofang Huibu and south of Xiushui, killing nearly 10,000 Japanese troops. This battle was one of the most brilliant scenes in Jiangxi's battles over the years. In December, China recovered Xiangfu, Jing'an City, Zhanggongdu, Longchangqiao, and other places, and stormed into the urban area of ​​Nanchang. Now, the Japanese puppets in Nanchang are panicked and heartbroken, forming extreme panic. In the later Lushan Minshan and other places, a wide range of guerrilla warfare was launched to make the Japanese restless. Five hundred battles were fought in the year, capturing Japanese officers and soldiers Otsuka Yosuke, Kashu Gunko, etc., killing more than 50,000 Japanese troops, and seizing more than a thousand guns and cannons. Furthermore, the Nanchun transportation was destroyed, which was very miraculous. The Japanese faced difficulties in land communication and resupply, and could not take care of the beginning and the end. In summary, in the 28th year, in addition to losing the two lines north of Nanchang and south of Xiushui, the remaining areas were all controlled by the Chinese army. Between the points and lines, more than 40,000 to 50,000 Japanese soldiers were absorbed. In the past, the ×××××× Corps withdrew for reorganization, and the new ones from the Yangtze River were also under heavy siege and attack. (Dispatch of the 4th)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Silver Issue: The Japanese Side Coerces Britain to Concede, Saying That Whether to Relax or Terminate the Blockade of the Concessions Will Depend on the Progress of Negotiations</h3>
<p>Tokyo: This question has received reports that negotiations between Britain and Japan in London, Tokyo, and Tianjin indicate that Britain is willing to make concessions. Britain seems to want to find out the scope of the rights Japan grants to British ships to navigate the Yangtze River before deciding on the final solution to the Tianjin silver issue. It is understood here that in the Tianjin agreement, the British side put forward two new conditions as the price for handing over the Tianjin silver: (1) A part of the Tianjin silver must be handed over to the British-Japanese mixed committee to help refugees in North China. (2) The remaining silver must be handed over to a neutral bank. Political figures here believe that the arrival of British Chinese Ambassador Karl in Chongqing is related to the future resolution of the silver issue. Tokyo newspapers believe that the above-mentioned solution is a concession from the Japanese side. Japan initially demanded that the British side unconditionally hand over the Tianjin silver. Now, adding conditions is to seek a compromise with the British side. Japanese officials reiterated that relaxing or terminating the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin depends on whether the British side is willing to make further concessions. Even if the guards in the British and French concessions are reduced, and even if British and French warships are withdrawn, the Japanese side does not consider it a friendly gesture towards Japan. Responsible personnel said that Britain's attitude towards China is only a slight retreat due to the European war and has not abandoned the principles it holds in China.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Personnel Disputes in Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Since the soaring prices, industrial and commercial employees have demanded subsidies to maintain their livelihoods, resulting in work stoppages and strikes. Fortunately, both parties can often deeply understand the meaning of mutual assistance and mutual concession, and all can be resolved peacefully. This newspaper has earnestly stated in the December 14th editorial "General Discussion on Labor Unrest"; It is hoped that employees will not make excessive demands, and capitalists will not take retaliatory actions. There is no need to make loved ones grieve and enemies rejoice, which is to preserve a part of the country's economic vitality. Now, as the end of the accounting period is approaching, according to the long-standing custom, the issue of dismissing employees from factories and firms is always carried out after the end of the accounting period. I would like to ask the leaders of all industries to consider the current difficult living conditions. All that can increase the severity of unemployment problems and indirectly threaten local security should be avoided in this extraordinary period if it can be avoided. Those that cannot be avoided should also weigh the severity of the incident and make a fair and reasonable decision, so that those who stay will know what to do, and those who leave will be punished, so as to demonstrate the spirit of faith, reward, and punishment, and stabilize a long-lasting and unexhausted organization. Unexpectedly, at this juncture of the Western New Year, some dismissal trends have been discovered; although their words are held by each, and their reasons are each unique, in this environment, the image of this dispute is most distressing.</p>
<p>Every dispute must have its own special facts and causes and effects. If we only discuss the merits and demerits of individual issues based on general principles, it will be difficult to be completely correct. However, what we want to discuss is that what we seek is labor-capital coordination, mutual assistance for survival, and mutual encouragement to avoid self-determination, and to give those who intend to sabotage the opportunity to take advantage of it. Sincerely, in terms of last year's prices, the Shanghai cost of living index in December increased by two times compared with the pre-war period, even in the first and second half of the year, if rice, wheat, and flour are more than doubled in value, and the price of oil is tripled; and like a spoonful of hot water, which sold for 1.7 cents before the war, now sells for 5 cents. The purchasing power of one yuan of currency is only 32.89% of the pre-war level. This kind of living situation is really unbearable for ordinary employees. When industry and commerce encounter expensive purchase prices or inflated expenses, they can follow suit and raise the price of their goods as a way to compensate; Then, employees still enjoy their original salaries and wages due to the very large expansion of living expenses. May I ask how can they live, how can they invest, and what can they get in return? Therefore, it is necessary to sympathize with and consider the wishes of employees to maintain their livelihoods. Those who take the posture of the masses also take their matter as a matter of the masses, and it is not regrettable that the momentum is close to extortion and it is immediately reported with even greater momentum. In this regard, employees must also consider various aspects and find ways to express their wishes well; If not, taking extortion as a good strategy, then their strategy is also flawed. Since the rise in prices, various companies and stores have been able to automatically improve employee treatment: some have increased salaries, some have set up a subsidy system as an exception, some have increased subsidies, and even exceeded room and board wages, and some have purchased rice and grain at low prices to transfer to employees for food, the methods are different, the examples are many, and the intentions are commendable. To be fair, last year's industry and commerce in Shanghai, except for a few special industries, were generally abnormally developed and abnormally prosperous; the thick profits can almost be said to be unprecedented. In view of this, treating employees favorably is in line with the principles of reason and emotion. However, because the development and prosperity are abnormal, why not be wary of the abnormality being the last year last year? The origin of the abnormality is due to the rise in prices and black remittances, so all those with inventory and those who prepaid foreign exchange have made three times the profit; and even more use "control" and "transport" to make "national disaster money", regardless of whether it is sweet or bitter, fragrant or stinky, in view of this, there are countless people who are rich. When the European war broke out, it was another opportunity to hoard and monopolize, no matter whether it was foreign goods or local goods, they all had the same style. If capitalists gain something, employees should also share a little of the surplus, which is reasonable. In the meantime, there are also those whose business cannot be carried out, who are struggling to maintain their employees' livelihoods and are willing to sit and eat away at expenses. Seeking in Shanghai's hundreds of industries, it is not uncommon, this is their deep and warm feeling of pitying colleagues. These people take into account the difficult times and the same boat in the storm, and promote their benevolence; however, planting the cause today, the consequences are in the future, people are not wood and stone, who will not strive to repay? It is important to know that the prosperity of the business is in the strictness of the method, rather than the harmony of human feelings. Those who are good at management must be able to understand this.</p>
<h3>The Chinese National Political Council Urges the United States to Sanction Japan, Deeply Believing That the United States Will Not Renew the Treaty with Japan, and That the Stability of the Far East Depends on the Future Policy of the United States</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chinese National Political Council today asked the United States to prohibit the transportation of military materials to Japan, because Japan's aggression against China today, the military materials it uses all come from the United States. The Political Council all believes that whether the United States will renew the treaty with Japan is Japan's internal affairs, so non-insiders should not arbitrarily comment on it, but "the Chinese people deeply believe that the United States will neither renew the treaty with Japan nor establish temporary measures with Japan to continue the trade between the two countries. Only in terms of the overall situation in the Far East, the Chinese people hope that the United States can take further action." Another senator, 20th Jie Hou, broadcasted to the United States here this morning, "If the United States continues to supply Japan with military materials at this time, it will only prolong the life of the aggressor. Therefore, if you cannot prevent the enemy and allow us to achieve an early victory, then at least you will not be of assistance to Japan." (Associated Press Dispatch of the 5th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Members of the National Political Council staying in Chongqing took advantage of the New Year's recess to discuss the US-Japan trade issue, which will expire on the 26th of this month. They all believe that whether the United States will renew the treaty is a matter of US internal affairs and should not express opinions, but the future of US-Japan trade is closely related to the stability of the Far East and world peace. Based on the deep friendship between China and the United States, it seems that our people should frankly appeal their views to the American people. Since Japan launched the war of aggression against China, the source of its military fire and military supplies has relied on the United States. In both quality and quantity, it is extremely important. Therefore, Vice Chairman Zhang Boling was specially elected to broadcast to the United States at a selected time, so that the American government and people can thoroughly understand the views of our people.

<h3>The US Government Temporarily Takes a Wait-and-See Attitude Towards Japan, Japan's Policies are Easier to Change, and an Economic Sanctions Plan is Inevitable</h3>
<p>Washington: According to US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman's statement to the Associated Press today, he intends that the Foreign Relations Committee will not consider imposing an embargo on exports to Japan before the US-Japan trade treaty officially expires on January 26. The Foreign Relations Committee is expected to meet on Wednesday, but the issues to be considered will be limited to domestic issues. According to Pittman, personally, he supports Congress's resolution to prohibit exports to Japan, but this proposal may not be passed by Congress at present, so he advocates that the resolution passed earlier should still be used as a method, that is, Congress authorizes the President to prohibit exports to Japan at an opportune time. According to detached observations, the proposal of the Board of Trustees is to give Japan all kinds of opportunities to improve relations with the United States before January 26. As for Pittman's meaning, he believes that Japan's violation of US rights and interests in China has not been sufficiently corrected. Although the US response to Japan is extremely slow, Japan must respect the assertion of military rights in China, which has become increasingly powerful. The general impression here is that if Japan cannot make a satisfactory solution to the United States before January 26, the State Department will ask Congress to pass an economic sanctions plan against Japan, because at that time, the sanctions plan against Japan will inevitably be passed in Congress, because all the US concessions to Japan have failed, and there is no other way but to be tough on Japan. As for now, taking a wait-and-see attitude is the most appropriate method. (Associated Press Dispatch of the 5th)</p>

<h3>Frequent Military Victories, London Chinese Bonds are Rising</h3>
<p>London: Chinese bonds rose sharply yesterday. The reason for this is nothing more than the hope that there will be real efforts to resolve the Sino-Japanese war soon. It is generally known that once the war ends, China's recovery potential will be very great. This can be seen from the latest customs statistics published by the Chinese Embassy. According to these statistics, China's income in 1939 was only slightly less than the previous year. Many people in the financial community who previously predicted that China's income would be greatly reduced now feel that although many of China's trading ports have been closed, China can still obtain this huge amount of customs duties, so once the trade situation returns to normal, China will definitely have a surprising recovery in commerce.

The New York "Times" published a dispatch from London for the second time in the past two days, stating that the staff of the Western countries' headquarters are now working hard to promote the involvement of Sweden and Norway in the war against Germany.

<p>Swiss Capital. The German and Soviet radio stations have been touting each other and jointly attacking the Allied countries of Britain and France for a long time, and recently they have become even more intense. The Soviet radio station constantly says that "Britain and France started the war." The German radio station vigorously stated that "the current situation in Europe should not be attributed to the Soviet Union," and said that "when Britain and France were preparing for war, they tried their best to alienate Germany and the Soviet Union, and tried to make them have bloody conflicts. And now, Britain and France are using the pretext of assisting Finland, which has led to the danger of the war expanding." (Havas dispatch from the 4th)</p>
<p>Rome. The Rome People's Daily correspondent in the capital of Sweden recently sent a dispatch stating that after German newspapers repeatedly issued warnings to Sweden, advising it not to assist Finland, public opinion in Sweden unanimously expressed dissatisfaction, saying that "neutrality" should not be confused with indifference or injustice. Moreover, the Soviet Union claims that it is not at war with Finland, and that its dispatch of troops westward is only to assist the Finnish "legal government" (referring to the People's Government led by Kuusinen) in resisting the country's commander-in-chief, General Mannerheim, and his "clique." So why should Germany be meddling? Judging from this statement by the Swedish people, it can be seen that if its borders are indeed violated, the people of that country will definitely rise up and resist, just as in the past.

<p>Swiss Capital. The German semi-official "Berlin Stock Exchange Daily" published an article yesterday, accusing the neutral countries of colluding with Britain and France because they are members of the League of Nations. The Basel Evening News commented that the true intention of Germany is unclear, and people generally fear that this strategy is a prelude to new pressure and new threats. The Bern Daily News said that this is an excuse for Germany to engage in new acts of aggression. In fact, that country has never respected the various principles on which the League of Nations is based. Instead, it destroyed Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, tearing up the alliances to shreds, which shows that the country has no right to talk about the qualifications of other countries to participate in the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>Copenhagen. The National Daily here today gave a strong response to the recent warnings issued by Germany to the Nordic countries, saying: We can now say publicly that we did not expect Germany to find it necessary to warn the Nordic countries not to allow their territory to be used for military purposes by other countries, because there is no such possibility. There is also one thing that we must absolutely clarify, that is, some people demand that the Nordic people should prevent the two major powers from assisting Finland, which is threatened by the dominant military force of Bolshevism, then this kind of demand is morally, materially, and militarily excessive.

<h3>The Soviet Union Is Unwilling to Conclude a Military Alliance with Germany, But Should Expand the Scope of the Non-Aggression Pact, So That Germany Can Prevent Other Countries from Providing Assistance</h3>
<p>London. The "Yorkshire Post," the mouthpiece of Dominion Minister Eden, recently reported that according to British diplomatic sources, Stalin would not agree to form a military alliance with Germany, nor would he change his current policy because of the situation encountered by the Soviet Union in the Finnish incident. Therefore, Germany and the Soviet Union should only expand the scope of the existing non-aggression pact, and Germany should put pressure on the Scandinavian countries to isolate Finland. In other words, if other countries attempt to send formal troops to land in the ports of these countries to assist Finland in the future, Germany should use its navy to prevent them. Moreover, if the number of volunteers from various countries going to Finland is too large, Hitler will also decide to take action. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital. According to news from Berlin, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will go to Berlin in the near future to return the visit. German political figures believe that the negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union are not limited to the Nordic incident, and often involve the situation in Southeastern Europe. Regarding the issue of allowing troops to be stationed in Romania, Germany is said to have inquired to Hungary about whether it would cooperate in dealing with Romania. The trip of Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky to Italy is probably related to this matter. (Havas dispatch from the 4th)</p>

<h3>Italian Newspaper Calls European War a Social Struggle</h3>
<p>Milan. "The Italian News," the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, published an editorial today, stating that the material interests of all countries in the world, regardless of belligerent or neutral countries, are directly or indirectly affected by the war between Germany and the Allied countries. The newspaper continued to say that today's European war can be called a "social struggle," a duel between the "have-nots" and the "haves." These "haves" possess large amounts of land and capital, which they use to exploit and suppress other nations, refusing to consider reasonable modifications to the international order. As for the "have-nots," they are causing a "social struggle" because of the large number of children and workers, and the wealth of wisdom and strength. If this kind of class cannot be broken in Europe, then there will never be a lasting foundation for European peace. (Haitong dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Lothian Speaks in the United States, Says German Offensive Can Be Repelled, Hopes to Transform the World Economy</h3>
<p>Chicago. British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian told the Foreign Affairs Association here today: "Judging from various phenomena, Germany is attempting to launch a terrifying offensive on land, sea, and air in the early spring, in order to defeat the Allied countries and achieve a decisive victory. But we believe that this offensive will be repelled." The ambassador mentioned the peace conditions, saying: "Today it is clear that in 1919, none of us understood what must be done in order for our hopes to be realized. The principle of the League of Nations must be that all members are democratic countries, and then it can succeed. The League of Nations was too harsh. Our biggest mistake was the economy. We sincerely hope that when the war ends in the future, all countries can be more far-sighted and discuss how the world can be economically transformed." The ambassador continued: "Britain can no longer and should not hold the reins of the world as it did in the last century. The rise of the rights of new naval countries and the power of the sky have made this impossible. Sea power should now be in the hands of all democratic countries, not just the strong countries." (Reuters dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>New York. The New York Times commented today on the speech by British Ambassador Lord Lothian to the Foreign Affairs Association in Chicago, saying that no British ambassador has ever given such a frank speech to an American audience as Lothian. His speech can represent the democratization and humanization of British policy, and is in harmony with the policy announced by President Roosevelt on Wednesday. The newspaper said that Lothian's opinion is the same as President Roosevelt's, believing that unless the United States participates in the peace, there is no hope for a final resolution.

<p>Berlin. According to the German official news agency last night, General Göring, in his capacity as Special Commissioner of the Four-Year Plan, issued an order again to centralize the national economy, will levy new war taxes, and implement forced savings. People with a monthly income of more than 400 marks must deposit a certain amount of money in designated banks. The government will use this money for the long-term war. (United Press dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin. The topic of discussion in German newspapers today is the centralization of the German wartime economy in the hands of General Göring. The "Essen National Daily" stated that at a time when the Allied countries are in economic difficulty and chaos during this transitional period, Germany has decided to maintain its starting point and seek to strengthen it. After the centralization of the wartime economy, it can produce great efficiency, which is crucial to military operations. At present, under the head of state Hitler, the cabinet committee for national defense assists, with Göring as the chairman of the committee. The committee members include Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces Keitel, Minister of Economy Funk, Minister of the Interior Frick, Secretary-General Lammers, etc. All major political and economic powers are in the hands of this committee, so that the nation's industry and commerce can adapt to military affairs during this wartime period. (Haitong dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>London. Regarding the German wartime economy being completely presided over by General Göring, the country's dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, political figures here have commented that the German side has openly admitted that this is a method to deal with the economic war between Britain and France, which shows that the British and French blockade policies have been effective. From now on, this blockade policy should be intensified, and after Germany's large reserves of raw materials are gradually depleted, there will eventually be a day when they cannot be sustained. It is expected that the country's military strategists will be forced by necessity to break through the British and French blockade at any cost. If so, then Germany will inevitably lose the initiative militarily. (Havas dispatch from the 5th)</p>

The Archbishop of Paris, Verdier, gave a broadcast speech at 7:45 this afternoon, calling on the people of the whole country to enthusiastically purchase the war bonds issued by the government. He said: "While we are striving to uphold our rights, we must not neglect material strength. At this time when the world tide is turning, the civilization and independence of the three countries are being oppressed. Our government wants to defend freedom for the whole world. It calls on the people of the country to do their duty. The people of the country will naturally enthusiastically contribute to strengthen the country. This is worthy of being a true friend of peace. Because weakness cannot overcome stubborn enemies, only strength can be relied upon.

<h3>South Patriotic Association Passes "Law Harming the Republic," Authorizes Government to Purge Terrorists</h3>
<p>Dublin - Yesterday, the South Patriotic Association passed an emergency bill authorizing the government to purge terrorists by a vote of 62 to 7. The opposition party also supported the government. During the debate, members of parliament frankly criticized the Irish Army. Professor Tierney stated that he was not surprised by the raid on the Phoenix Park armory. Those familiar with the army knew its poor quality, as the Irish Army's poor discipline and mixed composition would not be tolerated by any ordinary army. He said that a national government must now be established, and unless the two main parties in South Ireland reached a compromise, they would soon find that parliament or the parliamentary system was of no use to the nation. Prime Minister Valera stated that the theft of weapons from the Phoenix Park armory was due to routine dereliction of duty. He also said that if the government sought powers not permitted by law, it would be a serious matter, and the constitution would need to be changed. General Mulcahy stated that cooperation between the governments of South Ireland, North Ireland, and the United Kingdom must ensure that the people of South Ireland do not harm the property and people of North Ireland or the United Kingdom, or endanger the political relations between South Ireland and the United Kingdom. Parliament also considered another proposal to grant the government the power to detain suspects who endanger the country as a permanent measure. The South Ireland government had to propose this bill to repeal Section 2 of the "Law Harming the Nation," which Judge Duffy had recently ruled unconstitutional. Defense Minister Aiken stated that as small countries around the world are collapsing, South Ireland, as a weak nation, must have discipline if it wants to survive, and the government must have the support of all good citizens to eradicate revolutionary activities.

<p>Danzig - According to the "Political Newspaper," a large unit of Siberian troops is currently being deployed to the Soviet-Finnish front. This news is said to have come from absolutely reliable sources. Siberian troops are known to be accustomed to the freezing cold and snowy conditions, and their cold resistance is often far better than the troops currently on the Finnish front. The newspaper pointed out that it is not yet known whether the deployment of this unit indicates that the Soviet Union is preparing for a new offensive, but it at least proves that Soviet-Japanese relations have clearly improved, so the Siberian troops can be deployed.

<h3>Roosevelt's Speech: Berlin's Antipathy; Deemed as Weakening U.S. Neutrality</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - The "Electrical News" in Berlin claims that German political circles believe that President Roosevelt's speech at the opening of the U.S. Congress criticized Germany from beginning to end, and that the U.S. President has weakened the U.S.'s neutral stance. The suggestion by U.S. Navy Secretary Edison to place certain industries under direct national management can be said to be evidence of the above view. The U.S. government previously obtained the same power when the U.S. was about to enter the war in 1917. Although it is generally understood that it would be inappropriate to say that this U.S. step is a sign of preparing to participate in the European war, the Germans' confidence in the U.S.'s continued adherence to neutrality in all situations has now diminished. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Political figures here did not feel surprised by President Roosevelt's speech to Congress on the 3rd. They claimed that this speech did not provide any new explanations for the trend of U.S. policy and the attitude of the U.S. President. They offered two points for comment on this speech: (1) Roosevelt mentioned that the method of conquest is incompatible with modern civilization and mentioned the threat of strong countries to small countries. (2) The U.S.'s attitude towards the European war.</p>
<p>The "German Foreign Political Correspondence," the mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, stated that the 19th and 20th centuries are not lacking in precedents of large countries forcibly annexing small countries. At present, the British and French are still attempting to expand the war and involve neutral countries. Regarding U.S. policy, the newspaper believes that it will depend on the implementation of the neutral policy. (Haitong, 5th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Budget Faces Difficulties in Congress; Majority Does Not Approve of New Taxes; Special Committee to Be Formed to Study Solutions</h3>
<p>Washington - Congress is extremely cold to the new national defense taxes proposed by President Roosevelt in the budget. According to Senator Harrison, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, "It is not easy to raise 460,000,000 yuan. I dare not approve of this tax increase plan." Therefore, he advocated that a special joint committee be organized by the budget committee to study whether it is appropriate. The members of the House Budget Committee also mostly disapproved of the tax increase plan. However, if the Treasury Department can suggest a way to raise funds, Congress is willing to consider it. Otherwise, Congress believes that the 460,000,000 U.S. dollars should be deducted from other expenditure items and no new taxes should be added. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt today submitted to Congress the budget for the year ending June 30, 1941, which includes a large increase in U.S. national defense expenditures, estimated at 8,424,000,000 yuan. Revenue is 6,248,000,000 yuan, with a shortfall of 2,176,000,000. The amount of the previous budget shortfall was 3,933,000,000 yuan. The President advocated raising new taxes of 460,000,000 yuan to reduce the shortfall to 1,716,000,000 yuan. It is estimated that various relief efforts other than national defense will use 1,300,000,000 yuan, agriculture 900,000,000 yuan, public works and investment 1,100,000,000 yuan, pensions 1,200,000,000 yuan, public debt interest 1,100,000,000 yuan, and various administrative departments 1,000,000,000 yuan. Regarding the national defense estimate, the next session will increase by 300,000,000 yuan compared to this session. President Roosevelt said that in view of the current world situation, this expenditure is necessary to maintain ordinary national defense preparations and urgent expenditures. Although the budget has increased national defense expenditures significantly, other expenditures are being economized as much as possible. The additional taxes are based on the needs of next year's national defense expenditures. The federal government's credit is at its highest today.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt reviewed his financial policy, saying that the use of government funds to encourage private enterprises has had a great impact on both government and private income. National income has increased by 69% in the past year, the highest increase in the same period in history. The expenditure for relief efforts should be limited to actual needs, but if current hopes are not realized, it may be appropriate to revise this estimate slightly. Some criticize public debt, but it must be known that the government has established or purchased durable and significant assets, but these assets have not yet been included in the register. Regarding</p>
<p>National defense expenditures, including the cost of building army barracks, such as the 1,264,000 yuan needed to build barracks in Hawaii, is one of them. Although the President did not inform Congress of how to collect new national defense taxes, he said that the principle of taxation according to ability should be followed, and taxes that could reduce consumers' purchasing power should be avoided as much as possible. The public believes that the President's words imply that he will not increase commodity taxes, but will increase income taxes. President Roosevelt later submitted the Navy's regular budget to Congress, totaling 904,500,000 yuan, an increase of 183,000,000 yuan compared to last year. The President said that with the additional costs of certain emergency work,</p>
<p>The total amount of the Navy budget will be 1,224,000,000 yuan. Most of the increase will be used for shipbuilding. In addition to the 120 ships scheduled to continue construction, he asked Congress to approve funds to build two battleships, one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, eight destroyers, six submarines, one submarine supply ship, three seaplane supply ships, and one minesweeper. These two battleships are the ninth and tenth ships built in five years, and their tonnage has not yet been announced, but the Navy Department is preparing for 65,000-ton battleships. The Navy budget stipulates 145,000 naval officers and soldiers and 11,500 marines. The Army budget proposes 1,007,000,000 yuan for Army and Air Force expenditures. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>In addition, the President also said that the next fiscal year's budget includes (1) a temporary national defense fee of 302,151,000 U.S. dollars to strengthen the defenses of the "neutral zone of the American continent" and the U.S. coast, and to strengthen counterespionage work, (2) a fee of 291,980 U.S. dollars to promote friendly relations between American countries, and (3) a preparation fee of 40,000 U.S. dollars for the construction of a highway across the American continent.

<h3>Shantou Puppet Army Fails to Invade Fujian; Lin Zhiyuan Defeated at the Border; Captured While Fleeing Towards Raoping</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence, Lin Zhiyuan, a former member of the Fujian Provincial Government, and Xiao Shuyi, a brigade commander of the Provincial Defense Army, were originally related by marriage (Lin's sister is Xiao's sister-in-law). Recently, both have defected to the puppet side. Xiao has been officially dismissed from his military post and his seal of office has been confiscated by the National Government. Lin, as the puppet chief of staff in the Shantou puppet army under Wei Dazhi, guided the Japanese and puppet troops to invade Fujian from the Guangdong border. At the beginning of December, Lin led more than 2,000 puppet troops to invade in two routes. One route was led by bandit Tang ××, who invaded Zhao'an from Huanggang, planning to advance towards Yunxiao. Fortunately, Huanggang was recaptured by the Guangdong army on the 2nd, and they took advantage of the victory to force Shuifengguan (the border between Fujian and Guangdong). The Fujian army also launched a large-scale counteroffensive towards Zhao'an. The puppet army's rear was cut off and they were caught in a pincer attack, causing great panic. They built fortifications in the southeast of Zhao'an County, intending to hold out for reinforcements. After being surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army for three days, the puppet army was killed and wounded more than 700 people. Unable to hold out, bandit Tang led the remaining 400 people to escape into the sea at dawn on the 6th. The Chinese army took advantage of the situation to pursue, and many puppet soldiers drowned. The Chinese army entered the city at noon on the 6th to handle the aftermath. Unexpectedly, at 10 a.m. on the 7th, three Japanese aircraft flew from Shantou and dropped more than 20 bombs in the suburbs of Zhao'an, destroying many houses. The other route was led by Lin Zhiyuan himself, who wanted to invade Hepingfu on the border of Raoping, but was met and defeated by the garrison troops. Except for some killed and wounded, the rest turned to righteousness and requested to be incorporated. Seeing that the situation was not good, Lin hurriedly led the remaining 200 people to flee towards Raoping. On the 8th, while fleeing halfway, they were captured by the army. They are currently detained in a certain place, and the military authorities have been telegraphed for instructions on how to handle them. After Lin defected to the puppet regime, he and Yang Tingshu and Chen Baoshan set up a temporary office of the puppet Fujian Provincial Party Department in Xiamen, planning to guide the puppet army to invade southern Fujian from eastern Guangdong. After arriving in Zhangzhou, they would establish a puppet provincial government and Lin would assume the post of puppet governor. Unexpectedly, the initial dispatch of troops resulted in defeat and capture. From now on, the border between Fujian and Guangdong should be peaceful.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Attacks Japanese Army in Changxing Town, Haimen</h3>
<p>Six Japanese Soldiers Killed; One Tank Destroyed</p>
<p>Haimen Correspondence, Changxing Town in Haimen County has been occupied by the Japanese army for many days. At 6 a.m. on December 26, many plainclothes soldiers from the 2nd Brigade of the Provincial Security Army of the Chinese army, hiding box guns, broke into the Japanese army unit in the town, killing six Japanese soldiers and wounding several others on the spot. The Japanese army was unable to resist and all fled through the back door. The Japanese army stationed in Sanjiao Sijiatu heard the news and rushed to reinforce by tank, but were ambushed by the 3rd Company of the 3rd Regiment of the brigade and were severely attacked head-on, destroying one tank. Seeing that the Japanese reinforcements had arrived and were adding fierce artillery fire, the Chinese army withdrew from the town again. The brigade's soldier, Wu Xuefu, sacrificed himself bravely for the country, and the rest returned to defense safely.</p>
<h3>Prices Soar in Dinghai</h3>
<p>The Poor Starving and Freezing</p>
<p>Dinghai Correspondence, Dinghai is an isolated island in eastern Zhejiang. Although its fishery, salt, and seafood are the best in the country, its production of rice, wheat, and other grains is very small. Daily necessities such as cloth, southern goods, northern goods, medicines, cosmetics, enamelware, cotton, coal, soybeans, and wood must be supplied from other places. Since the fall of the city, the price of rice has soared due to Japanese purchases and the control of rice merchants. Recently, the price has reached 30 yuan per stone. Other items such as peanut oil have also risen to more than 1.10 yuan per catty. The worst cigarettes cost about 20 cents a pack. Bai Jinlong, Da Qianmen, Da Paotai, and others cost no less than 7-8 yuan or more than 10 yuan per tin, and are also difficult to buy. Matches cost 4-5 cents per pack. The prices of medicines, silk, coal briquettes, etc. have soared due to inconvenient transportation and obstructed sources. Vegetables and firewood, etc., are extremely inconvenient for villagers to enter the city, and they are often humiliated by the Japanese army, making it very dangerous. Therefore, they all hesitate to enter the city. As a result, there are few vendors in the small vegetable market in the city, and vegetables are cut off. Even if there are any, they cost no less than 10 cents per catty. The firewood that used to cost 1 cent for 2 catties now costs 2-3 cents per catty. Recently, due to the cold weather, a large number of poor people in Dongmen Chenggen and Donggangpu have died on the road due to starvation and freezing, a tragic sight.</p>
<h3>The Bandit Zhang Xiongnan of Fujian Has Been Killed; Bandit Zhang Was Receiving Funds from Japanese Aircraft; Zhang's Concubine, Ye Jinwen, Was Also Captured Alive</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Zhang Xiongnan, the third brigade commander of the Fujian Security Forces, after his rebellion, gathered over a thousand of his subordinates and entrenched himself in the mountainous regions bordering Yongchun, Dehua, Datian, and Xianyou counties in central Fujian Province. Additionally, two groups roamed the borders of Yongtai and Yunxi counties, creating disturbances. On one hand, they incited the able-bodied men in various villages to evade conscription and expand their forces. On the other hand, Japanese aircraft transported counterfeit banknotes of the Bank of China and the Fujian Bank to serve as military pay. They also remotely communicated with Huang Dawei's troops, who were conscripted from Chaozhou and Shantou, creating quite a rampant situation. The provincial authorities dispatched Huang Zhenwu, the director of the Security Bureau, as the commander of the bandit suppression in central Fujian, supervising the teams. First, the bandit areas were blockaded, cutting off their transportation and supplies, and then they were suppressed from multiple directions. Over the past two months, the bandit area gradually shrank, and the bandit crowds also collapsed one after another. The enticed able-bodied men even withdrew and returned, causing the bandit forces to become increasingly impoverished. Unexpectedly, in late November and early December, Huang Dawei suddenly sent Lin Zhiyuan with over a thousand pseudo-soldiers from Huanggang on the Guangdong border, sneaking into Zhao'an in Fujian, attempting to seize Longxi. Upon hearing the news, Bandit Zhang also tried to break through from Yongchun, escape to Anxi, and join the pseudo-soldiers in Changtai, with the intention of launching a major offensive. The situation was quite tense for a while. Fortunately, the pseudo-soldiers who invaded Zhao'an were immediately ambushed and annihilated by the border defense forces of Fujian and Guangdong provinces. Lin Zhiyuan was also captured alive in Raoping and sent to the Guilin headquarters for interrogation. Seeing that the general situation was gone and the weather was getting colder, the bandits were still wearing autumn clothes. Due to the transportation blockade, they were unable to purchase cotton clothes, and they were suffering from hunger and cold. Many deserted. Bandit Zhang only led more than two hundred remnants with guns from Shiniushan Mountain in Yongchun to Fengdingge in Dehua. Huang Zhenwu personally led his troops, tracked them down, and encountered the bandits in Guguyu, Fengdingge, on December 16. The bandits fought and retreated, with numerous casualties. Zhang Xiongnan was unable to escape and was killed on the spot. His concubine, Ye Jinwen, was also captured alive. Now, Zhang's body and Ye Jinwen have been sent to Dehua City. The body has been examined and properly buried, while the concubine awaits the disposal of the Pacification Headquarters. The various counties of Yongde, Xian, and Da, which were ravaged by the bandits, can now begin to handle disaster relief, and Fujian Province has thus eliminated a major hidden threat.</p>

<h3>General Situation of China's Promotion of Compulsory Education (II)</h3>
<p>(II) Brief History of Development</p>
<p>China's promotion of compulsory education began in the late Qing Dynasty. The regulations were already quite comprehensive, but they were merely empty words and were not actually implemented. After the establishment of the Republic of China, four years of compulsory education were defined, and in 1915, an order to prepare for compulsory education was promulgated, stipulating thirty-one procedures for the implementation of compulsory education. In 1920, methods for promoting compulsory education were re-established, stipulating that it would begin in 1921 and be completed by 1928. A research association for the practical journey of compulsory education was also established for research purposes. However, it ultimately failed to be effectively implemented due to the constant wars of the warlords and the unending civil strife. There was no fixed method for raising funds. After the establishment of the Nationalist Government, the former University Council, in accordance with the resolution of the First National Education Conference in 1928, issued a general order to all provinces and cities to organize compulsory education committees to assist educational administrative organs in promoting compulsory education. In 1929, the Third National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang passed a resolution to vigorously implement compulsory education. In the same year, the Second Plenary Session of the Third Central Executive Committee also resolved to vigorously implement compulsory education, tasking the Training Department with formulating plans, regulations, and implementation procedures in conjunction with the Ministry of Education, with a deadline of the end of 1934 for implementation. The Ministry of Education then formulated a preliminary plan for the implementation of compulsory education based on this plan. The distribution of compulsory education funds shared by the central, provincial, and local governments, the training of teachers, and the expansion of school buildings were all separately stipulated. The Second National Education Conference in 1930 also drafted a plan for the implementation of compulsory education. In addition to setting the term of compulsory education at four years, poor children could vary or shorten their schooling period. Later, the Ministry of Education believed that the number of children nationwide only accounted for 21.8% of the total number of school-age children, and the promotion of compulsory education was inevitably slow. Therefore, in June 1932, it promulgated the Outline of Short-Term Compulsory Education Measures, ordering all provinces and cities to formulate plans for regional experiments. A total of eighteen provinces and cities reported their plans to the Ministry for record. This was the beginning of China's promotion of compulsory education. This short-term compulsory education lasted for three years, but it still failed to fully benefit. Later, based on the resolution of the Fifth Plenary Session, the Outline of Provisional Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education was revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval on May 28, 1935. After being promulgated and implemented, the Ministry also separately formulated detailed implementation rules, ordering all provinces and cities to raise funds, formulate plans, and actively implement them. The central government also allocated huge amounts of money to subsidize all provinces and cities. China's promotion of compulsory education has thus moved from advocacy to the stage of implementation.</p>
<p>(III) Phased Implementation Plan</p>
<p>The Plan for the Implementation of Compulsory Education formulated in 1935 was probably due to the difficulty of raising funds. Therefore, it stipulated a phased promotion method, first running one-year and two-year short-term primary schools, gradually reaching four-year elementary primary schools. Its implementation procedure was set in three phases:</p>
<p>A. The first phase, from August 1935 to July 1940. All provinces and cities widely established one-year short-term primary schools, enrolling out-of-school children aged nine to twelve, providing them with one year of compulsory education. In addition, elementary primary schools were promoted, the original grades and quotas of primary schools were enriched, the two-shift system was vigorously implemented, private schools were improved, and mobile teaching was piloted. By the end of this phase, at least 80% of the total number of school-age children nationwide should have received at least one year of equivalent education.</p>
<p>B. The second phase, from January 1940 to July 1944. During these four years, in addition to continuing to operate in accordance with the methods of the previous phase, all one-year short-term primary schools will gradually be converted into two-year short-term primary schools, enrolling out-of-school children aged eight to twelve, and providing them with education. By the end of this phase, at least 80% of the total number of school-age children nationwide should have received at least two years of equivalent education.</p>
<p>C. The third phase, starting in August 1944. All two-year short-term primary schools should gradually be converted into four-year primary schools, so that all school-age children nationwide should receive at least four years of compulsory education. After this plan was finalized, all laws and regulations related to the plan, such as the Outline of Provisional Measures for Compulsory Education, Detailed Implementation Rules, Measures for Dividing Primary School Districts in Cities and Counties, Measures for Investigating School-Age Children, Measures for Implementing the Two-Shift System, Measures for Implementing Mobile Education, Measures for Improving Private Schools, Regulations for One-Year Short-Term Primary Schools, Regulations for Two-Year Short-Term Primary Schools, Organizational Regulations for the National Compulsory Education Committee, Regulations for Compulsory Education Inspectors in Provinces and Cities, and Regulations for Compulsory Education Inspectors in Counties and Cities, were all successively formulated, promulgated, and implemented. The implementation plan for compulsory education is thus fully prepared.</p>
<p>During the period of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, in view of the fact that promoting compulsory education is a fundamental undertaking, it should be expedited. Therefore, this year, all provinces were ordered to establish two-year short-term primary schools in advance, and a second-phase plan for promoting compulsory education was formulated, striving to popularize compulsory education and complete it as soon as possible within the specified period, so as to consolidate the foundation for the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. Recently, the central government also promulgated the organizational outline of county-level organizations, stipulating that a national school should be established in each Bao according to the Baojia system, and a central school should be established in each township "Zhen", so that compulsory education and mass education can be promoted simultaneously, and political education will be integrated to strengthen the driving force and quickly complete the construction of basic-level politics, culture, and economy.</p>

<h3>Guo Youshou Publishes Report on the Situation of Compulsory Education in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>(Former Chongqing News) Guo Youshou, the Director of the Sichuan Education Department, recently published an article titled "Overview of Compulsory Education in Sichuan Province," detailing the number of compulsory education schools in various counties and cities in Sichuan Province in 1938: 6,652 schools, 12,800 classes, and 493,235 students. The central government subsidy and the province's own compulsory education funds: in 1938, the central government subsidized 100,003 yuan, and the province raised 100,000 yuan. According to statistics, there are 6,807,133 school-age children in the province, of whom 1,385,241 have been enrolled, and 5,411,892 have not been enrolled. The province has decided to implement the new county system from March 1940, integrate political education, establish national schools in Bao, and central schools in townships. Regarding the required teachers and funds for implementation, the provincial government will comprehensively plan and train them. A six-year plan is currently being drafted to promote it decisively.</p>

<h3>Inter-Port Football Match: Hong Kong Team Decides to Come to Shanghai; Hong Kong Team is All Westerners; Three Matches to be Played in Shanghai</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong United Press) The secretary of the Hong Kong Football Association announced today that Hong Kong has decided to accept Shanghai's invitation to send a team to Shanghai for an inter-port match during the Lunar New Year. The selection committee met tonight to discuss the candidates for the team, but no decision was made. The selection will be postponed, because some team members are in the reserve team of the Chamber of Commerce and must first obtain the approval of the Hong Kong government to take leave to go to Shanghai during the Lunar New Year. In general, this leave will be no problem, because the number of people asking for leave is extremely small. The fact that Chinese players such as Li Huitang are not selected this time (according to the Chinese players' refusal to come to Shanghai) will disappoint Shanghai. After the Hong Kong team comes to Shanghai, it will follow the usual practice of playing three matches: (1) Inter-port match (2) Against the Shanghai Chinese United Team (3) Against the Shanghai Military United Team. According to news from this port, Mr. Spike, the secretary of the Shanghai Westerners Football Club, stated that Shanghai has sent a letter of invitation for the Shanghai-Hong Kong inter-port match, but has not yet received a formal reply, so the specific measures are still difficult to determine.</p>

<h3>Great Victory of the Chinese Army in Northern Guangdong; Shanghai Citizens Thrilled and Jubilant; Joint Telegram to the Commander-in-Chief to Wish the Final Victory; Bond Prices Surge, Rarely Seen in Recent Times</h3>
<p>The great victory of the Chinese army's counterattack in northern Guangdong, with more than 10,000 Japanese casualties, and the continuous progress on the Xiang, E, Jin, and Yu fronts have also been reported in recent days. The hearts of the people in Shanghai are extremely excited. Yesterday, the bond market soared sharply. The various national organizations in this city believe that at the beginning of the new year of 1940, the frontline military has achieved major victories, which proves that the future of China's resistance is bright and is on the rise. In addition to being excited, they jointly sent a telegram to the Military Commission in Chongqing to congratulate the frontline soldiers and express their condolences. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Citizens Jointly Send a Telegram to Congratulate</p>
<p>(Omitted above) We are pleased to hear of the great victory in northern Guangdong, with more than 10,000 Japanese casualties. We are extremely excited after hearing this. We hope that you will continue to make persistent efforts to eliminate the ugly captives, restore our homeland, strive for independent survival, and complete the great cause of national reconstruction. The Shanghai citizens cannot help but pray with incense. We respectfully send a telegram to congratulate you and express our gratitude. We hope you will accept it. The Shame and Honor Movement sends a telegram to Jiang to congratulate</p>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Shame and Honor Movement Committee congratulates the Supreme Commander and the frontline soldiers for the great victory of our army in northern Guangdong, and sends a telegram to the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government, and forwards it to the frontline soldiers. This time, while our army was actively counterattacking in Guilin, the Japanese army transferred its elite forces to launch a fierce attack on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, hoping to contain our forces and reverse the shame of its defeat in northern Hunan. Thanks to the Supreme Commander's decisive command and divine strategy, and the frontline soldiers' unanimous obedience, we created a second glorious record after the great victory in northern Hunan. The good news has spread, and we are overjoyed. The members of this committee, in addition to mobilizing all Shanghai citizens to cultivate their integrity, promote honor and shame, and to protect themselves, so as to make persistent efforts, eliminate the demons, and achieve the final victory, respectfully send our greetings and wish you success. The Shanghai All-Circles Shame and Honor Movement Committee kowtows and sings.</p>
<p>Unified Bond Prices Soar</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's maintenance of bond credibility has never changed. Although the tariff-guaranteed unified bonds have been forced to stop payment due to the interception of tax revenue, the eight times of repayment of principal and interest on the unified A, B, C, D, and E bonds, which are discounted and paid by the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture, have been set to be paid on January 30. As for the Shanghai securities market, because the government's maintenance of bond credibility has been consistent and the eighth repayment of principal and interest is approaching, and at the same time, the Chinese army in northern Guangdong has won a victory, the market is extremely excited. Therefore, bond buying has become popular and prices have soared. The closing prices for yesterday morning and afternoon are recorded as follows: Unified Type A: 60.06 yuan in the morning, 60.08 yuan in the afternoon; Type B: 51.35 yuan in the morning, 50.80 yuan in the afternoon; Type C: 49.25 yuan in the morning, 49.50 yuan in the afternoon; Type D: 48.15 yuan in the morning, 48.30 yuan in the afternoon; Type E: 48.85 yuan in the morning, 49 yuan in the afternoon. The soaring prices are truly rare in recent times.</p>
<p>Japanese Authorities Admit Defeat</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily reported on the 5th that, according to the Japanese military authorities, the Japanese army in Guangdong has achieved its goals. What are these goals? That is, to destroy all the defense works owned by the Chinese. According to the spokesman, he denied the rumors that the Japanese army was defeated miserably in northern Guangdong, but said that after the "victory," the Japanese army "voluntarily retreated" to some strategic strongholds. The spokesman finally said that the purpose of the Japanese army's current operations is not to occupy land, but only to consume the Chinese army.</p>
<h3>Colonel Becker Visits the Municipal Council; Pays Respects to the Chairman and General Manager</h3>

<h3>Large Batch of Wounded Japanese Soldiers Transported; About 1,000 Soldiers</h3>
<p>According to a gentleman who works at the North Railway Station, a large number of wounded Japanese soldiers have been transported recently on both the Jinghu and Huhang lines, especially at night. There are at least three or four carriages, each carriage carrying about 20 to 30 wounded soldiers. Since New Year's Day, there have been about 1,000 soldiers, all of whom have been sent to wounded soldier hospitals in Hongkou, Zhabei, western Shanghai, and the southern city. Therefore, the wounded soldier hospitals in Shanghai are already overcrowded. It is also heard that a large number of wounded Japanese soldiers from Yixing, Zhejiang, have been transported to Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and other places for treatment.</p>
<h3>Moral Rearmament Movement: Widely Launched; Shanghai Propaganda Proceeds as Usual; Emphasis on Practice and Extending to Others</h3>
<p>The Moral Rearmament Movement aims to transform society and rebuild the world, starting with the moral rearmament of individuals, eliminating corrupt habits, and changing bad lifestyles, with the four principles of absolute honesty, purity, unselfishness, and love as the guidelines for life. All countries in the world are now unanimously promoting it in order to save the world and increase the eternal happiness of mankind. The Moral Rearmament Movement in Shanghai made a large-scale promotion from the 1st to the 3rd of last month. The regular propaganda work is still proceeding as usual. The Eastern Radio Station broadcasts the Moral Rearmament Movement every day from 12:45 PM, and the Gospel Radio Station broadcasts it every Thursday from 8:30 PM (English), and every Saturday from 7:30 PM (Chinese). The Gospel also broadcasts Dr. Wang Wanbai's lecture "Impressions of Traveling in the United States" every day from 7 PM, which, in addition to reporting on the proceedings of the World Moral Rearmament Movement Conference, also includes many elucidations on the meaning of moral rearmament and reports on personal experiences. People in the movement recently received reports from cities such as Pingjin, Kunming, and Chongqing. The Moral Rearmament Movement in Chongqing is also widely launched in the mainland, and the promotion is quite smooth. The characteristic of the movement is that it does not adopt the form of organization, but is entirely based on the personal practice of enthusiastic participants and extending it to others.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Poor Fortunes: Charity Groups Rush to Organize Winter Relief - Distributing Bread and Ginger Soup on Longmen Road - Planning to Establish a Shelter in Xujiahui</h3>
<p>Since the winter solstice and the subsequent two cold waves, which resulted in the deaths of over a hundred people (the actual number is likely even higher), charitable figures in Shanghai have been paying close attention. They immediately began preparing to establish relief shelters and implement price controls on grain to aid the impoverished masses suffering from hunger and cold. It is now known that the Shanghai Charity Federation has already started work on providing both cooked meals and shelters.</p>
<p>Due to the great demand for space in Shanghai's foreign concessions, it has been impossible to find a suitable location. Therefore, it has been decided to change the plan to something similar to providing cooked meals, choosing a location to distribute two loaves of bread and a bowl of hot ginger soup to each person in the evenings to help them ward off the cold. It is said that the area around Longmen Road has been chosen as the distribution point, and the distribution will take place there every evening, starting on January 9th (the first day of the twelfth lunar month). The ginger soup will be prepared by the Renji Orphanage, and the bread will also be custom-made from a bakery. The police will be dispatched at that time to maintain order. Finding a location for a shelter is even more difficult than finding a location for a soup kitchen. Only two factory sheds near the Xujiahui Catholic Church are available. Mr. Huang Hanzhi, Mr. Wen Lanting, and Mr. Guan Jiongzhi have already written to Father Zhong of the church to discuss the matter, and Mr. Zhu Zhiyao went to make contact yesterday. As soon as the negotiations are completed, they will begin preparations.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it will only be for three months. When the earth revives and the weather warms, the shelter will be closed. It is hoped that the police will also be willing to assist. Those who are often not reached by relief efforts but are actually experiencing great suffering in their lives are the...</p>
<p>Respectable Poor</p>
<p>These people often have husbands working in professions or many mouths to feed, and their income cannot cover their expenses, or they are suffering from poverty and illness. The hunger and cold they endure are no less severe than those of impoverished people wandering the streets. It is now heard that the Federation is extremely concerned about providing relief to the respectable poor, and is currently working to prevent them from freezing and starving. The benefits of this are as great as those of providing relief to the general poor. There are many impoverished people in Shanghai, and the funds needed for relief are considerable. Although the initial expenses will be covered by the Federation's remaining funds, Mr. Huang Hanzhi once said that...</p>
<p>Various Expenditures</p>
<p>were greatly reduced in the past, causing much resentment and criticism. Now, it is very comforting to have this kind of winter relief effort. However, the matter is important and funds are limited. If there are no donations to support it, it will still be difficult to maintain. Fortunately, there are many charitable people in Shanghai who will surely donate generously to this winter relief effort to help it succeed.</p>
<h3>Flat-Price Grain Program Imminent - Flat-Price Grain Committee Established Yesterday - Will Continue During the Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai People's Food Coordination Conference established a Flat-Price Grain Committee to be fully responsible for flat-price grain sales and fundraising, the Committee held its inaugural meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road. Chu Qiaqing, Wang Yuqing, Chen Ziyi, Zhang Nianxuan, Ma Shaoling, Ding Fangyuan, Zhu Yinjiang, Zhang Jiguang, Zhang Zemin, Guo Shun, Cao Xin, and others were present. Chu Qiaqing chaired the meeting, and Yang Youlong served as the secretary. The chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting, and then the discussion began. The following resolutions were passed on the spot: (1) to draft articles of association and a declaration, (2) to appoint more passionate people as committee members, and (3) to actively solicit flat-price grain funds from all sectors of society. The Committee's address is on the second floor of 93 Guangdong Road. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Millions in Funding - Currently Being Raised</p>
<p>The Flat-Price Grain Committee has already purchased 16,000 bags of Saigon broken rice from the Shanghai market and has decided to hold flat-price grain sales in the near future. As for the specific methods of flat-price grain sales, the Flat-Price Grain Committee will decide tomorrow. In addition, it has telegraphed Saigon to order 15,000 bags of foreign rice, which will be loaded onto ships and transported to Shanghai, arriving around the end or beginning of the lunar month, in preparation for continuing the flat-price grain sales during the lunar New Year. Regarding raising donations for flat-price grain sales, a target of one million national currency has been tentatively set, and donations are already being solicited from all industries.</p>
<p>Continuing to Telegraph Orders for Foreign Rice to Regulate the Market</p>
<p>After the People's Food Regulation Association handled the registration for foreign rice orders, many groups, organizations, companies, and firms enthusiastically registered to order rice. In addition to already telegraphing Saigon to order 600 tons of high-quality rice, the Association immediately sent a second telegram to Saigon to continue ordering foreign rice. The quantity will be determined by the Purchasing Committee. As for the Shanghai Rice and Grain Trade Association's assessment of the market, because foreign rice has been arriving in recent days and the source of domestic rice has been cleared, the amount of rice stored in the two Shanghai concessions has gradually increased, and the price of rice has stabilized.</p>
<h3>Factory Association Fights for Certification of National Products - Presses the Ministry to Provide Equal Treatment with the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Association requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to grant equal treatment to national product groups in certifying national products for transit, as current regulations only allow the Chamber of Commerce to provide such certification. The original telegram stated: "To Minister Weng Jun of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing: When members of our association apply to join, they undergo strict investigation and are approved by the executive committee's resolution. Only purely national product factories that use national raw materials, or firms with no manufacturing plant, are allowed to join. Since the outbreak of the war, we have continued to operate according to the established rules. We note that the Ministry's 'Measures for Registration of Local Products at Customs' issued in 1935, lists both the Chamber of Commerce and the National Products Factory Association in its articles. We have seen reports that the Ministry's 'Measures for Preventing National Products Factories from Using Non-National Raw Materials and Inspecting Imported Local Products' only stipulate certification by the Chamber of Commerce. This may cause misunderstandings among the import inspection agencies in various provinces and ports. Therefore, we urgently request that the Ministry telegraph all cities, coastal defense areas, Saigon, Hong Kong, and Chinese Chambers of Commerce in overseas ports such as Nanyang, Little Luzon, Singapore, and Cebu, stating that all local products produced by national product factories within the Shanghai concessions, which are in transit or being imported, and which hold a certification letter from our association, should be treated equally to those certified by the Chamber of Commerce. All should be given convenience for promotion, to encourage production and increase resources. Our association is a specialized group for promoting national products and has always strictly supervised. All impure factories have long been rejected. This is stated in combination. The Shanghai National Products Factory Association respectfully submits."</p>
<h3>Opening of the Yangtze River - Reportedly to Occur on February 1st</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports: "A Japanese Navy spokesperson stated yesterday (the 4th) that Japanese officials are currently rushing to handle the matter of reopening the Yangtze River. They have held long meetings every day during the New Year holiday to discuss this matter." Another report says that the Japanese side has set February 1st as the date for implementation.</p>
<h3>After the Japanese Troops in Changshu Were Attacked - A Five-Day Search - City Closed for Two Hours Each Day - Over Three Hundred People Arrested</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese troops in Changshu were attacked on New Year's Day, they have closed the city for a thorough search, which has lasted for five days without any progress. According to someone who has come from the area, since the 4th, the east, south, and west gates have been opened for two hours each day, from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM and from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Outside of these times, no one except Japanese soldiers is allowed to enter or exit. Even those who enter or exit during these times are subject to strict inspections. It is said that the residents of the city have been searched thoroughly for days, with some being searched three or four times a day. As a result, anyone with the slightest suspicion or with inconsistencies in their household registration is arrested and considered to be connected to the guerrillas. It is estimated that over three hundred people have been arrested in the past four or five days. They are currently being held in the City God Temple inside the west gate, guarded by Japanese soldiers who are often abusive. Among them are also some members of the puppet pacification team and puppet civil servants. The relevant puppet authorities have requested their release on bail, but this has not been approved. It is said that this incident occurred before dawn on New Year's Day, when guerrillas first killed the guards of the Japanese headquarters (located at the former county government site on Daoqian Street), and then charged in. The Japanese troops were unprepared, resulting in heavy casualties, which led to the closure of the city for a thorough search. It is now rumored that the Japanese claim to have obtained some clues. Because of this, the city gates will remain closed. The city is isolated from the outside, and residents are reluctant to enter or exit the city gates. The city is very desolate, lifeless, and prices are soaring. Vegetables are 30 cents per catty, and straw is 20-30 cents per bundle. Residents are extremely anxious.</p>
<h3>Citizen Associations in Various Districts Endorse Group Coal Purchases - Coal Prices Drive Up Other Prices - Efforts to Suppress Prices Are Essential</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal First Special District Citizen's Joint Meeting and the Second, Eighth, Twelfth, Fifteenth, Eighteenth, Twentieth, Twenty-fourth, Twenty-sixth, and Twenty-seventh District Branches jointly sent a letter to the General Association yesterday, stating: "To whom it may concern, our city has a population of nearly four million, of which only a small number are able to provide for themselves without worry, and even fewer are actually wealthy. Therefore, high prices have a great impact on the livelihoods of ordinary people, and are also of great importance to social stability. While there are price limits in place for rice, the soaring price of coal, which is a...</p>
<p>Stimulus to Prices</p>
<p>and raises the prices of other commodities, is also worthy of attention. Recently, it was reported that your association's members, Zhang Yizhai, Liu Shenying, and Ge Futian, suggested that industrial users unite to purchase and transport coal as a group to ensure supply and suppress coal prices. This is an essential plan for the present situation. We have found that many prices on the market are rising due to the high price of coal.</p>
<p>Examples Abound</p>
<p>The price increases in hotels and bathhouses are common examples. The increased costs of factories and restaurants are also due to this. The price increases for pancakes and fried dough sticks are no different. Therefore, the rise in coal prices has a widespread impact on prices. Furthermore, the Engineering Bureau has specially approved price increases for public utilities such as electricity, tap water, and streetcars, which are also...</p>
<p>Affected by Coal Prices</p>
<p>In addition, the price of coal balls has been steadily rising and is now more than five times higher than before the war, making it difficult for ordinary citizens to make ends meet. It can be seen that the rise in coal prices has a profound impact on the general public. To suppress prices, it is necessary to first suppress coal prices. Suppressing coal prices is as important as suppressing rice prices. Our association and others express our unanimous support for the recommendation of your association's members, Zhang and others, to purchase coal as a group to stabilize prices. Given the need for people's livelihoods, we ask that you unite with all relevant parties to quickly develop concrete measures and implement them. We are infinitely hopeful."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Issuance of Aluminum Coins - In Denominations of One Cent and Five Cents - Central Mint Begins Minting</h3>
<p>After the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks worked hard to regulate the shortage of cent coins and auxiliary coins and one-yuan notes in the Shanghai market, the panic over the shortage of cent coins has gradually subsided. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Ministry of Finance has approved the Central Bank's proposal to issue one-cent and five-cent aluminum coins. The regulations for auxiliary coins have already been revised, and the Central Mint has been ordered to begin minting. These aluminum coins will have the same value as the one-cent and five-cent cent notes in the future. The purpose of issuing aluminum coins is to regulate the shortage of auxiliary coins, and aluminum coins are more durable than auxiliary coins.</p>
<h3>Over 40,000 Exposed Corpses Collected in Shanghai Last Year - All Collected and Buried by the Pushan Villa - Funding Greatly Needed for This Benevolent Act</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Pushan Villa, the statistics for the collection of exposed corpses in the twelve months of last year are shocking. A reporter from the Datong News Agency has recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Over 40,000 Corpses Collected Last Year</p>
<p>According to the statistics, 5,852 corpses were collected and buried in January, 4,231 in February, 3,513 in March, 3,321 in April, 5,059 in May, 3,826 in June, 3,170 in July, 2,984 in August, 2,617 in September, 2,461 in October, 2,342 in November, and 2,709 in December. The total for the year reached 41,075.</p>
<p>Fewer Exposed Corpses Discovered</p>
<p>This is because the winter climate was not as severe as the winter of the previous year, so the total number of exposed corpses collected was lower than in the previous year. The total for the twelve months of the previous year was 10,618 adult male corpses, 4,371 female corpses, and 45,075 children's corpses, for a total of 60,064.</p>
<p>Rising Lumber Prices Make Coffins Expensive</p>
<p>Furthermore, due to the soaring price of lumber in recent times, each wooden coffin, which used to cost only three or four yuan, now costs at least thirteen or fourteen yuan. This has caused the Hall's finances to be stretched thin. The need for funds is even greater during the winter months. It is hoped that charitable people in society will donate generously.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Return to Posts on Bridges in Hongkou - Strict Inspection of Pedestrians and Vehicles - Situation North of Suzhou Creek Becomes Tense Again</h3>
<p>According to someone who came from Hongkou, something happened in Yangshupu in eastern Shanghai a few days ago. As a result, the Japanese authorities ordered the military police to send out patrols and maintain a high level of alert. The sentry posts that had previously been removed from the bridges (such as Outer Hongqiao, Middle Hongqiao, Inner Hongqiao, Sikaizi Bridge, West Jiaxing Road Bridge, Oujia Road Bridge, etc.) were suddenly restored yesterday. The inspection of vehicles and pedestrians is very strict. At the same time, outside the bridges connecting the central district of the concession, such as Waibaidu Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, North Sichuan Road Bridge, and the gaps at Haining Road and Wensanshi Road, in addition to the Japanese naval guards, more Japanese police have been sent to guard the posts, and the situation has become tense again.</p>
<h3>Difficulty in Collecting Donations from the Hotel Industry - Remarkable Results - Totaling Over 310,000 Yuan - Still Continuing</h3>

<h3>Airmail Temporarily Suspended - Regular Mail as Usual</h3>
<p>Since the sudden outbreak of the war in Europe, transportation has been disrupted and postal services have been difficult. However, the Shanghai Postal Administration has continued to dispatch mail from Shanghai to Europe, only with a longer delivery time. The Administration issued Notice No. 1596 yesterday, stating: "Due to the war in Europe, the Administration will temporarily suspend the acceptance of airmail to Germany from today." This is a special announcement. However, according to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, regular letters and small parcel mail to Germany are still being accepted as usual and are in no danger of being interrupted.</p>

<h3>Establishing Great Achievements - New Life for the Chinese Air Force - Aircraft Factory in the Yunnan Jungle - At Least 1,000 Japanese Aircraft Destroyed</h3>
<p>The China Weekly Review reports: "Near the Burmese border, in the Yunnan jungle 1,200 miles from the nearest Japanese air force base, an American-run aircraft factory has been established. With a capital of four million yuan, it manufactures one aircraft per day. If Japanese aircraft dare to fly there, they will be met with...</p>
<p>Heavy Anti-Aircraft Fire and Fierce Attacks from Fighter Planes." The factory is called the "Central Aircraft Factory" and is the third attempt to manufacture new military and civilian aircraft in China. The factory was originally established in Hangzhou in 1934. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, the factory equipment was moved to Wuchang. Later, when Hankou was about to fall, it was...</p>
<p>Moved to Kunming. However, it was determined that Kunming was also vulnerable to attack, and it was finally decided to establish the factory site in the southwest corner of Yunnan, about thirty miles from the Yunnan-Burma Road. Most of the aircraft materials are domestically produced. The weekly also published an article by Air Force Major General Zhou Zhirou, titled "The Undeclared Air War in the Last Two Years," reviewing...</p>

Furthermore, the...</p>
<p>Losses of Japanese Aircraft that Have Not Been Confirmed, as well as the 100 Japanese aircraft destroyed at the Hankou airfield during our bombing of the airfield in October, must also be included.

<h3>Municipal Council - Child Protection Work - December of Last Year</h3>
<p>The Salvation Army Children's Vocational Training School was relocated last month, which has temporarily left the Municipal Council's Child Protection Section without a place to settle children. At the same time, before the "Children's Welfare Association" can find suitable housing, the number of child beggars that the Association can take in has had to be limited, and the work of capturing child beggars on the streets has had to be temporarily suspended. Child beggars previously taken in by the "Children's Welfare Association" are currently residing in the Children's Asylum of the "National Child Welfare Association." Last month, the Child Protection Section handled a total of 65 cases, including 52 new cases. They are classified as follows: (1) missing cases 13, (2) abandonment cases 9, (3) homeless cases 9, (4) beggar cases 8, (5) abuse cases 4, (6) kidnapping cases 3, (7) lack of supervision cases 3, (8) prostitution cases 2, (9) mental disorder cases 1.

<h3>Shanghai's Traffic Shortcut - Can Transfer via Jintang Island - No Need to Travel on Japanese Ships</h3>
<p>The Tambay, a ship of the American company, China Merchants Navigation Company, was seized by the Japanese and repainted and renamed "Far East No. 4." It was initially managed by the "Huadong Shipping Company" and recently changed to the "Daye Shipping Company" as its agent, running between Shanghai and Dinghai (Hai). It set sail from Dinghai on the 31st of last month and returned to Shanghai. When passing through Shenjiamen, it was delayed for two days because it was New Year's Day and the local so-called "Controller" was "on duty." It finally arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 4th, berthing at buoy No. 21 in Yangshupu. Yesterday (the 5th) at 4:00 PM, it loaded a small number of passengers and cargo and sailed to Dinghai again. Furthermore, it is learned that passengers between Shanghai and Dinghai currently regard Japanese ships with great fear and mostly take other routes, or take the Shanghai-Ningbo line to Likang Town on Jintang Island, and then transfer to sailboats to reach their destination safely.</p>
<h3>French Tram Company - Issues New Token Vouchers</h3>

Only then may the goods be released. This telegram is for your compliance."</p>
<h3>Glucose Calcium Injection Causes Strong Reaction; Doctor Accuses Distributor of Negligence Causing Injury; This Medicine Is Sold Worldwide and Has Remained Unchanged; Court Orders Conclusion of Arguments and Sets Date for Pronouncement of Judgment</h3>
<p>Zhiwei Company at No. 14 Bowuguan Road, established by Wu Zhiwei from Ningbo, is the sole distributor in China of Calcinm Cornorate (i.e., glucose calcium), produced by the well-known American pharmaceutical company, Pro Strong Company. Recently, Wu Zhiwei was sued by Yu Tingxiang, a doctor, in the First Special Court's Criminal Division, represented by lawyers Qian Xingzhong and others, for negligence causing injury and other charges. The indictment briefly stated that the plaintiff, Yu Tingxiang, after graduating from the Tongji University School of Medicine,</p>
<p>Has Practiced Medicine for Eighteen Years and also serves as an examining physician for the Hua An Life Insurance Company in this city. The defendant, Wu Zhiwei, once sent an employee, Tian Yinglong, to promote the glucose calcium, one hundred ampoules (each containing ten cc), to the plaintiff. On October 17th, the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], the plaintiff, suffering from a cold and cough, asked his colleague, Mr. Lu Jinwen, at the company to inject ten cc of the aforementioned medicine into his buttocks. Half an hour later, the plaintiff felt cold all over and trembled violently. At the same time, his arms and legs were in severe pain, and he even partially lost consciousness,</p>
<p>His condition suddenly became abnormal. Later, his colleagues at the company gave him a cup of brandy and about five or six cups of plain water, and he gradually began to feel hot and sweat. It took three days and three nights for him to recover slightly. Several colleagues at Hua An Insurance Company witnessed this terrifying state. To this day, the plaintiff still shows signs of mental fatigue. He also recalled that on October 14th, 1939, he injected the same medicine for the same ailment into a patient, Xu Duzhou, and the same terrifying state occurred. Under these circumstances, the mental suffering endured by the plaintiff cannot be expressed in words. Moreover, the reputation of the plaintiff among patients has been severely</p>
<p>Affected Negatively. The plaintiff also had Dr. Lu Shifa, a forensic doctor, inject the same medicine of the defendant for the same ailment, and his patient suffered the same experience. The Zhiwei Company, founded by the defendant, is the exclusive distributor of Pro Strong Company's products in China, but it is completely unconcerned about the necessary precautions regarding pharmaceuticals, causing harm to the plaintiff's health, and violating Article 284, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, the crime of professional negligence causing injury. The portion of the incidental civil lawsuit is temporarily reserved, etc. This case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Shi Cong, who took the seat in Criminal Court No. 8 to summon the defendant, Wu Zhiwei, who also arrived with his defense lawyer, Li Zemin. Then, the plaintiff, Yu Tingxiang, through his agent lawyer, Qian Xingzhong, stated the</p>
<p>Reasons for the Lawsuit. Afterward, the defendant, Wu Zhiwei's, defense reason was generally that the glucose calcium produced by the American Pro Strong Company that he distributes is widely sold, all over the world. This medicine has remained unchanged for a long time. After this case occurred, the defendant sent a letter to the American Pro Strong Company to inquire, and they have already sent a reply to the plaintiff with a detailed explanation, etc. The court verified the confessions and ordered the conclusion of arguments for this case, setting the date for the pronouncement of judgment on the 11th of this month.</p>
<h3>Robbers Refuse Arrest on Sima Road; One Robber Shot Dead</h3>
<p>At 2:40 PM yesterday, four robbers suddenly broke into the residence of a certain family at No. 5, Lane 554, Hankou Road, in the Public Concession, and committed a robbery. They then fled with the stolen goods towards Sima Road. The victim called the police, and nearby constables received the report and gave chase. When they reached Sima Road, the robbers opened fire to resist arrest. The detectives returned fire, and for a moment, gunshots were frequent, and passersby fled in fear. One of the robbers fled to the entrance of the Tongxinglou Ye Guan (tea house) at the intersection of Shilu Road, where he was shot in the abdomen and immediately fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Afterwards, the detectives seized a pistol from his hand. The wounded robber was taken to the Public Works Department Hospital, where he soon died.</p>
<h3>Selling Counterfeit Money; Four Criminals Detained Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>The Jing'an Temple police detected that someone was secretly selling counterfeit banknotes in Room 10 of the Shenjiang Hotel at No. 7, Lane 140, Shandong Road, with a selling price of nineteen yuan for every hundred yuan.

She treated her own ten-year-old son with exceptional care, providing him with ample food and clothing. The other day, someone reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, and Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to investigate the address, which was confirmed to be true. Lu Baodi was sent to Renji Hospital, where doctors found her face pale and her body weak, with red swelling and numerous scars on her arms, legs, and buttocks. She was transferred to Jiliangsuo (a rescue center for women and children), while Jin Aqiu was detained by the police station and held in the women's section. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Third Criminal Division of the First Special District Court.

<h3>Dispute Over Renting a Shop Window; The Transferor Accuses the Transferee of Theft; The Plaintiff Accuses the Accuser of False Accusation</h3>
<p>Yu Xianqing, a Ningbo native and owner of the Hongda Shoe and Hat Store at the intersection of Shilu Road on Wuma Road, thirty-one years old this year, previously rented the shop window of the Nanyang Shoe Store at No. 565 Route Foch, from the owner, Qu Yuchang, to run a hat business. He also rented the attic upstairs of the store as a storage room and dormitory for employees. Recently, the owner of the Nanyang Shoe Store, Qu Yuchang, transferred the store's bottom line and assets to Wang Qingyu, a Ningbo native, and changed the brand to Dahua while still running the hat business. Qu then negotiated with Yu to terminate the rental of the shop window. After removing the copper bars, chrome hat racks, and other items installed in the shop window, and transporting them back, the transferee, Wang Qingyu, suddenly reported to the French police, accusing Yu Xianqing of stealing business equipment. The police summoned Yu, but Yu did not appear. Yu then appointed lawyer Wu Xiangxian as his agent and filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division against Wang Qingyu, accusing him of malicious false accusation of theft, requesting a legal investigation. This case was heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Zhang Minsheng. The plaintiff, Yu Xianqing, was represented by his lawyer, who stated the reasons for the lawsuit, saying that the plaintiff was afraid that he would be arrested and subjected to severe torture by the police because the defendant had reported him to the police station. Therefore, the plaintiff dared not appear in court. He also presented ledgers and invoices to prove that the items he removed were his own property, etc. The defendant, Wang Qingyu, accompanied by his defense lawyer, Chen Haisen, appeared in court and argued that the items removed by the plaintiff were the assets that the defendant had received in the transfer. Since the plaintiff did not appear today, he requested that a warrant be issued for his arrest or that the trial be suspended, etc. After reviewing the arguments, Judge Zhang announced that the case would be adjourned for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Banks Continue to Sell; US Dollar Exchange Rate Falls Below 8 Yuan</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday showed no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The private market for British and American currencies suddenly reported that the government would tighten control over currency exchange on the 8th of this month, causing Hong Kong merchants' funds to flow rapidly into the Shanghai market. Furthermore, there were relatively recent news of Sino-Japanese peace terms, which led the general Chinese merchants with long positions to close their positions in groups. The morning opening was affected by the sharp drop of 2.25 points in the British and American currency exchange rates, resulting in a state of loose British and tight American currencies. Later, Chinese banks again acted on behalf of Hong Kong banks to sell heavily. In addition, foreign banks had little appetite for buying, and American banks, such as Chase, intended to sell, making the position even more abundant, and the loose trend was difficult to suppress. By 9:45 AM, the US dollar exchange rate had fallen below 8 yuan, reaching 8.0625 yuan. The pound sterling also rose to 4 shillings 9 and 3/8 pence. However, HSBC and Sassoon started buying, and at the same time, many foreign firms also closed out forward US dollar positions, so it once returned to 4 shillings 8 and 1/2 pence and 7.875 yuan. After that, those who profited were content, and speculators suddenly came to sell. By the afternoon, the price could not be sustained due to further selling from Hong Kong and prevalent peace rumors in the market. By the evening close, it reached a loose price of 4 shillings 9 and 15/16 pence and 8.09375 yuan. As a result, the pound sterling fell by 2 and 3/4 pence, and the US dollar hardened by 3 and 1/8 cents. The futures market trend was no different from the spot market.</p>
<p>Pound Sterling Approaching 5 Shillings</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to the large London settlement, the recent term continued to shrink by 3/8 pence, the distant term fell by 1/4 pence, the New York silver price remained flat, the London gold price was undetermined, and the exchange rates of the pound sterling against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The US dollar sharply contracted by 2.25 points against the pound sterling, did not change against Shanghai, and plummeted by 1 and 3/8 pence against France. The central listed exchange rates remained the same. At the morning opening, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 3/4 pence for the pound sterling and 7.75 yuan for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the pound sterling was looser by 1/8 pence, and the US dollar was harder by 3/8 cents. Due to the decline in the exchange rate, major Chinese banks such as the Bank of East Asia first acted on behalf of Hong Kong banks to sell heavily after the opening, and the market immediately became loose. By the time HSBC's listed rates were announced without changes and the silver equalization tax was announced to be slightly more than half a penny, the pound sterling had risen to 4 shillings and 1/8 pence, and the US dollar had also hardened to 7.875 yuan. After that, foreign banks had even less appetite for buying, and American banks, such as Chase, intended to sell, so the loose trend accelerated. By 9:50 AM, the pound sterling had hardened to 4 shillings 3/8 pence, and the US dollar had also broken through the 8 yuan mark, reaching 8.0625 yuan. However, HSBC suddenly had the intention to buy, absorbing fellow banks at the current order of 4 shillings and 1/4 pence, causing the situation to suddenly soften. Later, Western merchant Sassoon also followed suit and bought, and the foreign firms also rushed to buy forward US dollars when they saw the scene, so the process continued to tighten. By 10:10 AM, the pound sterling had fallen back to 4 shillings and 1/2 pence, and the US dollar had also shrunk to 7.875 yuan. Afterwards, there were fewer buyers, and speculators suddenly sold, so the position became more abundant again, and the market trend hardened again. By 10:45 AM, the pound sterling had risen again to 4 shillings and 1/8 pence, and the US dollar had hardened again to 7.96875 yuan. After that, there were fewer trades, and the situation became stable. By the midday close, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 1/16 pence for the pound sterling and 7.96875 yuan for the US dollar, 1/8 pence looser for the pound sterling and 3/16 cents harder for the US dollar than the morning opening.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants to Sell Again in the After-Market</p>
<p>In the after-market, due to continued selling from Hong Kong and Chinese merchants continuing to close their positions, the market trend continued to harden. The pound sterling immediately rose to 4 shillings and 3/8 pence, and the US dollar hardened to 8.0625 yuan. During that time, foreign banks Youli and the Shanghai branch of Chinese banks had absorbed some. Later, it once turned stable. It was difficult to settle at the upper price. After entering the market, the atmosphere of Sino-Japanese peace rumors was quite strong, and Chinese merchants came to sell again, so it became slightly harder again. By the evening close, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 1/16 pence for the pound sterling and 8.09375 yuan for the US dollar, and the forward month was 4 shillings and 3/8 pence for the pound sterling and 8.03125 yuan for the US dollar. As a result, the spot and forward rates were looser by 2 and 3/4 pence for the pound sterling and harder by 3 and 1/8 cents for the US dollar than the previous day.</p>

<h3>Rumors Intensify: Gold Market Plunges into Selling Frenzy - Already Entering the 4,100 Yuan Mark -</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market continued its disastrous decline, becoming unbearable to witness, already plunging into the 4,100 yuan mark. This was mainly due to the exchange rate moving towards a looser trend. A telegraph from a certain source indicated hopes for an early end to the Sino-Japanese war, adding to the market's unease. As for the day's situation, the market opened lower due to the weak exchange rate, falling by 36 yuan to open at 4,090 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange rate continued to strengthen and gold firms rushed to sell, even though local buyers attempted to support the market, the declining trend was inevitable, pushing the price down another 15 yuan. Then, due to a sudden tightening of the exchange rate, coupled with massive absorption of Hong Kong dollars and rampant speculation by numerous retail investors, the price briefly surged to 4,120 yuan. Later, as the exchange rate eased again and local buyers stopped purchasing, many retail investors liquidated their long positions, causing the midday closing price to remain at only 4,095 yuan. In the afternoon, the underlying trend initially stabilized due to continued support from local buyers. However, ultimately, as the exchange rate continued to loosen and the atmosphere in the market was heavily influenced by hopes for peace, investor confidence failed to recover. Furthermore, the pressure to sell from gold firms and securities houses drove the price down to a low of 4,060 yuan. As a result, the market closed at 4,063 yuan, a sharp drop of 63 yuan compared to the previous day. The post-market trend became increasingly weak, with transactions occurring as low as 4,050 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was approximately 2,000 taels. Silver jewelry prices fell by another 5 yuan, while customs gold prices remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Plunges 63 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (10 taels) initially opened weak due to the strengthening exchange rate and fragile investor sentiment, leading to widespread calls to sell. In addition, many buyers were cautious and observing the market, causing the price to drop below the 4,100 yuan level. At 9:30 AM, a money exchange house initially sold 20 taels to a gold firm at 4,090 yuan, down 36 yuan from the previous day. Shortly after, a money exchange house bought over 100 taels on behalf of a client, quickly rebounding by 15 yuan. Another money exchange house bought 20 taels from a securities house at 4,105 yuan. Subsequently, due to the continued weak exchange rate and aggressive selling from gold firms and securities houses, the market once again declined, falling back to 4,090 yuan. At that time, a silver shop also bought on behalf of Hong Kong buyers, briefly recovering to 4,100 yuan. Later, as the exchange rate loosened further, selling pressure intensified, and buyers became scarce, causing the price to drop by 25 yuan. A securities house sold 10 taels to a gold firm at 4,075 yuan. Afterwards, the exchange rate suddenly tightened, and two money exchange houses rushed to buy on behalf of clients, causing speculative longs to ramp up prices, soaring by 45 yuan. A money exchange house bought 30 taels from a securities house at 4,120 yuan. Later, as the exchange rate loosened again, buying interest suddenly waned, and securities houses and silver shops resumed heavy selling, with many retail investors liquidating their positions, causing the price to drop by 30 yuan. A securities house traded 20 taels with another securities house at 4,090 yuan. Later, a securities house covered its short positions at a lower price, pulling the price up by 15 yuan. A securities house bought 20 taels from a silver shop at 4,105 yuan. Near the close, a silver shop and a gold firm sold 20 taels to another silver shop at 4,100 yuan. Simultaneously, silver shops traded 70 taels with each other at 4,095 yuan. The midday closing price was 4,095 yuan. In the afternoon, the market initially opened 10 yuan lower, with gold firms trading 20 taels with each other at 4,085 yuan. Later, a money exchange house slightly recovered 8 yuan, but the exchange rate weakened again, and gold firms and silver shops resumed selling, dropping the price by 23 yuan. A gold firm sold 30 taels to a money exchange house at 4,070 yuan. Later, a money exchange house bought on behalf of Hong Kong buyers, and the exchange rate stabilized, causing retail investors to gradually support the market, pushing the price up by 25 yuan. Money exchange houses traded 20 taels with each other at 4,095 yuan. Afterwards, the exchange rate loosened again, Hong Kong buyers became satiated, and gold firms and a certain securities house suppressed prices and sold, causing a sharp drop of 35 yuan. A silver shop sold 20 taels to a securities house at 4,060 yuan. Near the close, the price rose by 3 yuan, with a money exchange house buying 20 taels from a gold firm at 4,063 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell by another 63 yuan compared to the previous day. The post-market trend became increasingly weak, and money exchange houses sold off some holdings, falling to as low as 4,050 yuan. Throughout the day, the price fluctuated by 60 yuan.

The price at the Xin Tong Hang was the same as the previous price, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies weakened further due to abundant supply from Hong Kong. Demand for British and American gold pounds was extremely scarce, while the supply of gold notes was frequent, causing market prices to plummet.

Type E bonds surged past 9 yuan, and Type C bonds approached 50 yuan. Experienced players liquidated excess long positions, causing market fluctuations and preventing a straight upward trend. It is only a question of time before the price exceeds 50 yuan, based on market sentiment and the environment. Trading was relatively active yesterday, with Sheng Da continuing to buy aggressively, and Lianhe, Tong Kang, Kang Yuan, and No. 38 also buying. Tong Shun, Hengfu, Lianyi, and Juxin saw some long liquidation, while Da Feng initially sold and then bought. Demand still exceeded supply in the open market, rising by 0.2-0.3 yuan in the morning, and the situation improved in the afternoon with a tense atmosphere. Type C bonds reached 49.8 yuan, and Nos. 4, 16, and 20 were in demand. Tong Kang added positions and Tong Shun also went long. Da Feng continued to initially sell and then buy, while Mao Tai, Jiu Feng, and Xie Da sold off, slightly suppressing the market. After the close, the market was good, with Type A bonds trading at 61 yuan and Type C bonds trading at 49.9 yuan. Market prices gradually rose by 0.3-0.6 yuan, with a total turnover of approximately 1.2 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Unified A | 60.95 | 60.50 | 60.50 | Up 0.45</p>
<p>Unified B | 51.80 | 51.20 | 51.80 | Up 0.60</p>
<p>Unified C | 49.80 | 49.25 | 49.50 | Up 0.50</p>
<p>Unified D | 48.40 | 48.15 | 48.20 | Up 0.20</p>
<p>Unified E | 49.15 | 48.50 | 49.00 | Up 0.45</p>
<p>London, 4th Telegram: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign bonds saw a sharp rise due to the atmosphere of Sino-Japanese peace. Despite Japanese restrictions on Chinese trade last year, the results were still positive, increasing hopes for peace. Crisp rose by half a pound to 25.5 pounds, and Reorganization Loan (British Issue) rose by one and a half pounds to 37 pounds. The rest remained stable.</p>
<p>London, 4th Telegram: Today's market prices of British Far East companies' stocks saw mixed ups and downs. HSBC Bank's London-registered shares rose by one and a half pounds to 83.5 pounds, and Hong Kong-registered shares rose by one pound to 85.5 pounds. Gulang Yau Rubber shares fell back by 7.5 pence to 12 shillings and 6 pence, and the rest remained flat.</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 30 shares of Qing Feng Yarn Factory were traded at a price of 48 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market at the General Chamber of Commerce continued its upward trend. Almost all rubber stocks rose to new highs. As reported the previous day, many low-priced stocks, such as Karen-Dandenong, Chen Shi, and Bang, were very popular, overshadowing higher-priced stocks. However, compared to the recent unique surge in these smaller stocks, the proportional undervaluation of these higher-priced stocks is undeniable. Among industrial stocks, China Merchants' stock was the most actively traded, closing with buyers at 8.7 yuan. Ewo Cotton Mills stock stood firm at 29 yuan, and Jardine Matheson advanced to 225 yuan due to rumors of dividends.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Dalian Oil Has Arrived, Leading to Softening Crude Oil Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market was filled with pessimistic sentiments. Soybean oil saw no transactions throughout the day, as a batch of soybean oil from Dalian had arrived in port, totaling approximately 1,200-1,300 barrels (some say 1,800 barrels), causing a blow to investor confidence. Currently, there are hopes that the authorities in Dalian will continue to release oil, which could alleviate the situation for the residents of the isolated island. However, sellers were unwilling to sell at low prices due to high costs, so the price remained unchanged. Peanut oil prices softened as a result, and Hong Kong buyers were also observing the market. Only 10 barrels of Jiangbei crude oil were traded at 97 yuan, down 3 yuan from the previous day. 30 barrels of Qingdao crude oil were traded at the original price of 103 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Supply Stable, Still Needs to Pass Through Hongkou</h3>
<p>Yesterday, over 1,000 bags of early and late rice from Nan Gang and other inland sources continued to arrive in Hongkou, while goods from the Sujia Road area were still scarce. However, it was heard that after repeated negotiations by the authorities of the concession, a certain party will release goods for transport soon. Since the amount of rice seized by a certain party this time was substantial, temporary relaxation may be possible. This may strike a blow to the other party, as farmers in the interior would rather store grain and sell it in large quantities when needed, rather than speculate, making it difficult to plunder. On the other hand, shipments of foreign rice continued to arrive, and goods ordered by the Light Adjustment Committee and others were also plentiful, so market sentiment showed no intention of holding firm, with everyone looking to sell. Goods that had been out of the market for a long time were also being offered for sale. Sales improved after noon, with local shops becoming active again, but buying interest was weak, and the market saw no significant changes. Near noon, there were sudden bulk transactions, and the situation gradually became lively, with prices rising. However, due to the congestion of goods in the market, it was difficult to secure enough supply, so the sales volume was good, with total sales exceeding 10,000 bags, but closing prices for japonica, indica, domestic rice, and foreign rice only increased by 0.1-0.3 yuan. Chang Kun high-grade japonica remained at 40 yuan, while Nan Gang early and late rice were only 36.5 yuan and 36 yuan, Saigon was 36.5 yuan and 36.3 yuan, broken rice was 32.3 yuan, and inferior rice was 29.8 yuan. The price situation was similar for other varieties. See the price list for details.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was absorbed by local shops, and the market became more active. The fixed price for No. 1 Saigon was still 46.3-46.4 yuan, which was over 1 yuan higher than the market return price of 45 yuan, so the previous three or four telegraphs were not properly delivered. However, another 500 tons of broken Saigon were ordered at 34.8 yuan, with shipment expected around the 20th. The spot price for 4,000 bags was 36.75 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 35.5 yuan for No. 2, and 32.2-30.06 yuan for broken rice, up 0.2-0.3 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, another 3,798 bags of foreign rice arrived on the Taikoo Company's Shandong轮 from Hong Kong. It was heard that a French vessel was directly loading a large shipment of foreign rice from Saigon, and the exact amount will be reported after the vessel arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Markets Stabilize, Qingdao Traders Active in Buying Lower-Grade Flour</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the price for No. 2 Flour Mill remained unchanged at 9 yuan, and the upward trend gradually subsided. Spot sales in this street saw a sudden increase of 0.3 yuan, making buying interest less enthusiastic, while the price for traders reached 9.5 yuan, and buying interest from traders was not very strong. As a result, Qingdao traders focused on buying lower-grade flour, with approximately 20,000 bags traded, including Blue Cannon at 8.4 yuan, Red Peony at 8.9 yuan, Fufeng White Bag Flour at 7 yuan, and returned Che Chuan brand flour at 9.4-9.2 yuan. After a period of excitement the day before, the market for Japanese flour became sluggish yesterday. Some long positions in Phoenix brand flour for January were liquidated, with an opening price of only 9.056 yuan, later rising to 9.1 yuan, up slightly from the previous day. 8,300 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin today, and another 3,000 bags were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market also stabilized. Although some shipments arrived sporadically from the Suxi area, the amount was very small. Sellers were unwilling to sell easily due to high production costs and transportation difficulties, while mills had ordered foreign wheat several times because domestic wheat supply was insufficient. Although the foreign wheat orders had been announced, sellers were still unwilling to lower the price of domestic wheat. As a result, wheat from Changshu, Wuxi, and Suzhou was priced at 15.5 yuan, and wheat from Zhenjiang was priced at 15.3 yuan. Fuxin Mill bought 6,000 bags, and Fufeng Mill bought 4,000 bags. The market was in a state of ferment.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Bulls Exit, Cotton Yarn Prices Fall Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market weakened, and prices fell again. This was due to the exchange rate continuing to weaken, causing investor confidence to dissipate. At the same time, real demand remained weak, and speculators expected the exchange rate to weaken further after the new year. Therefore, they were disappointed that the exchange rate was not tight, but rather loose. Some also said that mills were considering opening up yarn supplies, which discouraged bulls, who sold off their holdings and liquidated their positions. The market became increasingly soft, while the situation for raw cotton remained strong. Yesterday, 500 pieces of yarn arrived from Ningbo, 1,257 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, and 55 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened higher in the morning, continuing the weak momentum from the previous day. The market lacked buyers and had more sellers, so the trading volume was not as strong as the previous day. As a result, those who usually speculated on the open market reversed course and sold off their positions. The opening price was 748 yuan, down 5.5 yuan from the previous day. Shortly after, it was heard that the exchange rate continued to weaken, and selling pressure intensified, causing the market to plummet to 735 yuan. By the close, it was heard that the exchange rate had slightly strengthened, and short sellers covered their positions, causing the price to rise slightly. The total trading volume for half the day was 1,905 bales. The price for 20-count Shuangma yarn fell by 12.5 yuan, Shuangqiu fell by 15 yuan, and Tiannu fell by 16 yuan. The amount of each type bought by various traders is listed below:</p>
<p>Local Traders: 1,500 bales, Hong Kong: 330</p>
<p>Inland: 40, Southeast Asia: 15</p>
<p>Hunan: 20, Total: 1,905</p>
<h3>Yarn Sales Slow, Cotton Transactions Weaken</h3>
<p>Transactions for domestic cotton weakened. Inter-dealer buying and selling was not as active as the previous day. Although foreign cotton was stable and prices did not fall, yarn sales were slow, and mills were hesitant, causing the market to be soft. 1,011 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived from Northern Jiangsu, and 2,678 bales arrived from Beisha. The situation for spot cotton is listed below:</p>
<p>Huocao Bag: 162.00, Traded by Local Traders: 747 bales</p>
<p>Nantai: 164.00, Traded by Local Traders: 301 bales</p>
<p>Huocao Bag: 166.50, Traded by Zhaoxing: 345 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou: 14.00, Traded by Local Traders: 100 bales</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: New York cotton prices initially surged in the morning due to buying from overseas cotton merchants. Later, the market weakened due to hedging by Southern traders and short selling. As a result, closing prices fell by 35 basis points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton was expected to rise by over 5 Rupees, Egyptian cotton fell by 40-50 basis points, and Liverpool rose by over 10 士.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton: Due to recent exchange rate fluctuations and rumors, various cotton prices in the city reversed from rising to falling, resulting in quiet transactions. Mills were also hesitant about purchasing raw cotton due to weak yarn prices. Japanese traders were also hesitant. The following are the factory prices based on an exchange rate of 8 yuan for the US dollar:</p>
<p>20-count American Middling: 214.50</p>
<p>Same: 230.25</p>
<p>21-count Same: 241.35</p>
<p>Same: 135.35</p>
<p>42-count Same: 144.75</p>
<p>Same: 137.05</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hawthorn Slices Decline</h3>
<p>Hawthorn slices have arrived recently with three to four hundred pieces, and the market has softened. Yesterday, the fruit traders put out a hundred pieces of clean goods at 33.5 yuan. The price has dropped by around 3 yuan. Rough goods are holding at 30 yuan, but have not been traded.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Pepper Prices Weaken</h3>
<p>The purchase volume of pepper has been gradually slowing down recently, and the market has softened. This is also due to the weakening of the exchange rate, making the price more favorable. Yesterday, No. 1 black pepper was sold at 90 yuan, black large pepper at 92 yuan, Wen Dao white pepper at 155 yuan, and Dutch at 142 yuan.</p>

<h3>What to Talk About?</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>"You're editing Free Talk? Then what are you going to talk about in your Free Talk?"</p>
<p>Knowing that someone would definitely ask this, I might as well state a few things here myself.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, a supplement called "Free Talk" is of course meant to be a casual conversation, talking about everything. But there's one thing I really want to state here: Free Talk is definitely not nonsensical chatter, and Free Talk is even less about rambling nonsense.</p>
<p>We know that we exist in a society, and we are living our lives, so what we will focus on is society and life. We hope that Free Talk can provide some of the knowledge needed in life, raise the general interest in society, increase the joy of life, and promote the light of the world.</p>
<p>In the universe, humans are a tiny species, but they are not useless. If we can make good use of our own strength, we can create much happiness; conversely, we can also create much disaster.</p>
<p>We have the same view of Free Talk. Free Talk is a small garden, but prosperity and desolation are entirely up to human effort. We hope that Free Talk can become a place of rest for the minds of every reader.</p>
<p>We admit that we, like anyone else, have our prejudices and weaknesses, but we are willing to accept any well-intentioned criticism and guidance with the most humble attitude. We are willing to do our best to eliminate the ignorance, superstition, and forces of darkness in the world, and to continue this never-ending work. We hope that we can stand on the side of enlightened thought, the pursuit of truth, the development of freedom, and the creation of light. Our ultimate goal is to make this world a more touching, more rational, more beautiful, and happier place.</p>
<p>Therefore, starting today, Free Talk has the following minimum requirements:</p>
<p>Do not make aimless moans, do not write harmful articles.</p>

<h3>Declaration of Human Rights</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiade</p>
<p>The great modern British thinker H.G. Wells recently collaborated with several friends to draft a "Declaration of Human Rights," which was published in the London Times in the form of a letter. The contents are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>"Everyone has the right to obtain nourishment, housing, medicine, and care. He has the right to receive full education, making him a useful citizen who cares about public affairs. He and his private property should be protected by the police and the law. He should receive</p>
<p>should receive full protection against any slander or defamation that distresses or harms him. He can freely engage in any legitimate occupation. He can freely travel anywhere in the world at his own expense. He has the right to do business. If he has not been accused of committing a crime, he should not be imprisoned for more than three weeks, and if he has not been publicly tried in court, he should not be imprisoned for more than three months; this does not apply to those with legal proof of mental illness. A person should not be subjected to any surgery that stops reproductive function unless he expresses his consent. If he is living in imprisonment, he should not be threatened with excessive silence, noise, light, or darkness, so as to cause mental distress. If he voluntarily fasts or goes on hunger strike, people should not force him to eat, nor should they prevent him from starving. If he commits a military crime, the maximum penalty he should receive is imprisonment for no more than fifteen years or the death penalty. The clauses and principles contained in this declaration should be specified in detail in the legal code. This declaration includes past declarations related to human rights and should become the fundamental law of mankind worldwide in the future."</p>
<p>Is this another utopia, an ideal state? No. The main points of this declaration have probably already appeared in other declarations related to human rights in the past. What is mentioned here are the minimum rights that every human being should enjoy. But what kind of treatment do male and female citizens in many modern countries in the world receive from their governments today? The heartbreaking phenomenon caused by inhumane and human rights-stripping acts is shocking and deeply saddening.</p>
<p>Mr. Wells has already set down some fundamental principles for human society. When the dark clouds of war and turmoil that surround the world dissipate, and when all peoples use human culture instead of violence as the basis for resolving difficulties and disputes, we hope that these fundamental principles will be universally applied in all countries of the world. We hope that the strategies proposed by Mr. Wells will spread to all places, be adopted as teaching materials in all schools, and be read by everyone. We hope that these fundamental principles will grow in everyone's heart, like green plants growing towards the sunlight.</p>

<h3>The First Year of the Second European War: Christmas Scenes in Paris and London</h3>
<p>— Shi Tao</p>
<p>The outbreak of the European War has already passed several months, and everything seems quite calm. Although German floating mines are so active, the Maginot and Siegfried Lines remain unbelievably desolate. British planes scatter propaganda leaflets instead of bombs, and Germany even presents umbrellas to Chamberlain on the French front. Economic warfare is a characteristic of modern warfare, and this statement is gradually becoming apparent in the Second European War. Under the wartime system, the people of Britain and France are welcoming the first Christmas of this great war. One would imagine that they would be living a very melancholic and terrifying life, but no, Christmas is joyful, and Christmas finally paints a layer of harmonious color in their hearts.</p>
<p>Paris, Still Celebrating as Usual</p>
<p>The French seem strangely indifferent to the war on the front lines. They believe that the economic war of the entire nation is more important than anything else. It is difficult to find significant reports from the front lines, while the rear is constantly planning to normalize daily life. Their minds are filled with slogans such as "Ending the Emergency" and "Normalization."</p>
<p>Therefore, Christmas during wartime is the same as usual, with nothing special about it. The streets are bustling with open-air stalls, displaying many mouth-watering turkeys and delicious, colorful wines. These foods are being bought by passersby as if they were flying off the shelves. The streets of Paris everywhere present a joyful and lively scene.</p>
<p>Eating, drinking, and dancing are the only constant embellishments of the French Christmas. Many soldiers are granted special permission to return from the grim front lines to the flower-like Paris. They happily enjoy themselves with their wives and children. Although these soldiers on leave from the front lines are on vacation, they still cannot take off their uniforms when going out. Therefore, a characteristic of this year's Christmas in Paris is that the dance halls and restaurants are filled with military uniforms.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, the most lively places in Paris have been open until 11:00 PM, but now a notice has been issued to extend the closing time to 12:00 midnight starting from Christmas Eve. Parisians do not like to celebrate Christmas at home. They have a habit of going out to celebrate Christmas with others, so taverns, restaurants, and other places are quickly fully booked. On that day, the restaurants in the city are flooded with groups of men, women, old, and young, drinking fine wine, chewing on delicacies, and enjoying the pleasures of life. Even in wartime, people there can still eat and drink as they please. Paris is truly worthy of being a great city for entertainment.</p>
<p>This is partly due to the impregnability of the Maginot Line, and partly to prove how sound the French national economy is during wartime. However, from the outside, Paris has disappeared into darkness, and it is impossible to find its form. Although France is celebrating the joyful festival, it is also considering the German air force's air raids. Therefore, the control of lights is still strictly enforced. The streets at night are completely dark, but as soon as you step inside a door, there are still brilliant lights, gentle heating, and abundant wine waiting for you to enjoy. Theater, music, and movies... are all performed in the dark. This year's Christmas in Paris, the appearance is indeed lacking in joy, but the interior is still so brilliant.</p>
<p>London Without Children</p>
<p>To welcome the Christmas holiday in the night with lights controlled must be something that had never happened even during the First World War! "Let us temporarily forget the war and spend Christmas as happily as usual." Unconsciously, this kind of emotion silently arose in the hearts of the British people. The streets are full of Christmas scenery. A part of the British soldiers on the western front had already hurriedly embarked on their journey home two days before Christmas, each returning to their longed-for hometown. Some sailors and airmen were also on leave. The department stores in London were as busy as last year, and entertainment venues such as theaters, restaurants, and nightclubs were still full. The railway authorities also increased the number of trains to facilitate travelers during the Christmas holidays. Christmas is the happiest day for children, but in London, 300,000 children have been dispersed to evacuation areas. In order to comfort the children returning to the evacuation areas, Santa Claus visited them earlier than in previous years. The children's parents took Christmas gifts on special trains to the evacuation areas and returned after spending an early Christmas with their children. The authorities told the children's parents: "No matter how much the children cry, you cannot bring them to London!" Therefore, it is impossible to find a child's shadow in London on Christmas.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Thoughts</p>
<h3>The Right to Be Human</h3>
<p>— Jia Yin</p>
<p>From the moment a small life is born, it should be considered a person. The right to be human can be said to be a gift from heaven. But unfortunately, this is not the case in reality. Because of the irrationality of the current social system, the unfortunate majority of people living in the world are constantly threatened by hunger and cold, oppressed by harsh environments, and abused by dark forces. In this deformed society, some people simply do not have the right to survive or receive fair and legitimate treatment. This is such a tragic thing.</p>
<p>Throughout history, many progressive thinkers have established the rights that people should enjoy. Now, Wells and others have summarized their opinions, added some new ideas, and drafted this "Declaration of Human Rights," which is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Humanity is moving towards an enlightened historical path. We hope and believe that one day, everyone will have the right to be human.</p>
<h3>Talking Points</h3>
<p>— Shi Ding</p>
<p>According to a United Press report, ammunition worth $18.5 million is piled up at the docks of New York, ready to be shipped to Europe for the Allied countries. Amid the satisfied laughter of American arms dealers, we seem to hear the cries of European women.</p>
<p>Due to the severe cold, 67 child corpses were discovered in western Shanghai in one day. Poor little lives, you must be much happier now than when you were living in hunger and starvation.</p>
<p>The European situation is changing rapidly. German speculative merchants have invented a loose-leaf map to change borders at any time. They are truly ingenious and knowledgeable people.</p>
<p>Brazilian Consul General Vasconcelos of London said at a farewell banquet for the Brazilian Ambassador to Britain: "The need for international criminal law has never been greater than today. Aggressors should be directly responsible for brutal events, just as murderers should be held accountable. For the chief culprits who launch such great disasters, we have only one way to deal with them: to mobilize the power of the majority to drive out the aggressors; and to have the police of peace-loving countries intervene." If it can be done in reality, who would not agree?</p>

<h3>Old Stories of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Wu Gongshou</p>
<p>The senior Peking opera critic, Mr. Sun Yusheng (alias Haishang Shushisheng, deceased), once told me more than a dozen "Anecdotes of the Pear Garden," which were extremely valuable. Here are two excerpts:</p>
<p>(1) Private Costumes Started with Zhou and Li</p>
<p>When actors perform in a troupe, regardless of whether they are male, female, painted-face, or clown, all costumes are provided by the troupe. Therefore, the large costume box, the second costume box, the cheongsam box, and the weapon box are all fully prepared for the actors to use. Even top-notch actors do not have so-called private costumes. In the middle of the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty, Zhou Fenglin opened the Dan Gui Tong Ji Teahouse on Daxin Street. Zhou was a famous female impersonator who wanted to show off her costumes in order to attract audiences. She specially made many costumes, but the costumes she purchased could be used by all the female impersonators in the troupe, not just for her personal use. She created the category of private costumes, the funds for which did not come from the public account but from her own pocket. As a result, others could only purchase their own. Thus, the female impersonator world started the practice of private costumes. Li Chunlai opened the Chun Xian Teahouse on Daxin Street and followed suit. The male martial roles also prepared their own. Gradually, actors playing the roles of old men, old women, and young men, whose salaries were between two and three hundred yuan, also made some costumes for the sake of looking good on stage. From then on, this practice became a habit, and the stage presented a splendid and colorful scene. However, the actors had an additional expense, and as the saying goes, the wool comes from the sheep, so the salaries increased more and more.</p>
<p>(2) Xiao Kuiguan Was Not a Graduate of a Formal Opera School</p>
<p>Among the roles in Peking opera, the painted-face role is the most difficult to find. It requires a loud voice, a tall physique, powerful movements, and skillful tumbling, and proficiency in weapons. Therefore, the painted-face roles in the Peking opera troupes are divided into copper hammer, frame, and martial clown. If there is one person who can combine these strengths in various plays, only Da Kuiguan stood out in the past, and thus enjoyed great fame. The successor, Xiao Kuiguan, was inferior in copper hammer and frame plays, but his tumbling was unmatched by ordinary actors. However, he was not a graduate of a formal opera school. It is said that he was originally a cobbler who set up a stall at the entrance of the Tianxian Teahouse on Shilu Road. He became acquainted with the people in the teahouse and would go into the teahouse to watch plays in his spare time. He was determined to learn and later became a disciple of Da Kuiguan, inheriting his skills. However, martial arts skills learned halfway through life are different from those learned from a young age. Therefore, whenever he performed the play "Baishuitan," playing Qing Erhu, he would inevitably break his elbows and bleed when he tumbled in his bare body. The next day, he would tumble again, and it would be the same. People asked him if he felt pain. He replied that he had been doing it for so long that he didn't feel it. Alas, how could he not feel pain! He wanted to perform well, so he had no choice but to do so.</p>
<p>Travels in the Arts</p>
<h3>Original Art</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian (1)</p>
<p>Confucius said, "Set your mind on the Way, hold to virtue, rely on benevolence, and roam in the arts." This is the method of Confucius teaching his disciples to improve their virtue and cultivate their studies, which shows the importance of art in human life. Even the sage did not neglect it. The Record of Learning says that the word "roam" has the meaning of not being hasty. I think this view is very correct. Not to mention engaging in artistic cultivation and learning, even watching a play or listening to music, if you do not have leisurely time and mood, you cannot appreciate the benefits of art.</p>
<p>It is a very strange thing that the world seems to have some prejudice against the terms "artist" and "performer." In fact, what is the difference between "special envoy" and "special person," for example? Usually, people in the acting world are called performers, but most performers are rarely able to reach the point of being skilled in their own art without exceeding the rules; if we want to talk about being proficient, that is really like a phoenix feather or unicorn horn. The reason is that they only know how a certain play should be performed, but they do not know why it should be performed in this way. They know what it is, but they do not know why it is. Therefore, they can still be listened to when they perform in accordance with the rules and follow the old patterns, but if they want to innovate and make arbitrary changes with a half-knowledge, it is simply terrifying. Perhaps it is because the term performer is too abused, so the emerging drama and film practitioners are called artists. Indeed, most artists have received considerable education, just like bank clerks and money shop employees. Although the occupations they engage in are similar, social perspectives inevitably have some distinctions.</p>
<p>In the past, Confucius, Mencius, and Xun Qing were called the Confucian school; Lao Tzu, Zhuangzi, and Liezi were called the Taoist school; Mozi's universal love was the Mo school; Yin Wenzi's rectification of names was the school of names; the Legalist school was initiated by Guan Zhong and completed by Han Fei; the military strategists first had Sun Wu and then Wu Qi; they could all express their own views, write books and establish theories, and point out the obvious behaviors based on the principle of why, which are all worthy of admiration by future generations. I say that those who can thoroughly understand the principles of art can be called artists. Artists are different from performers, they must have a smart mind, a spirit of tireless learning, broad collection of refined thoughts, he not only has to know how, but also to know why, must know why, to know whether this is right or not, wrong certainly to change, that is, originally good, because to accommodate certain conditions, so to change a method, the changed method, must also be in line with the principle of reason. In China, in modern times, I think we need artists very much.</p>
<p>Dedicated to the Erhu</p>
<h3>The Origin of Sun Zuochen's Four Erhus (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>In his later years in Shanghai, he was down on his luck, and this erhu was also silent. Later, Mr. Xue took it away. (Mr. Xue's name is Bin, the fourth son of Xue Baorun, a wealthy merchant from Wuxi). The New Bamboo erhu was purchased by Sun in Beijing in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China for thirteen yuan. It is a new product, so it can be called New Bamboo. It is said that it is also in the hands of Mr. Xue; the Thin Crane erhu is thin and long, and its sound is like a crane's cry. The pegs have been worn thin due to the passage of time and are about to break. Now it is in the possession of my friend Mr. Qian, who was given it by Sun out of gratitude for his kindness; I often visited his residence, took it off the wall, and played a tune, its sound was clear and melodious, equal to my Sun's Phoenix erhu; my Phoenix erhu was sent by Sun's son at his request at the time of his death, as detailed in my essay "Record of Obtaining the Erhu," which was published in this newspaper, so I won't repeat it here. Why is this erhu called Phoenix? Because the bamboo of its entire body is red-purple, and its sound is yang, "Phoenix facing the sun," this erhu resembles it, the rod is thick and the tube is small and flat, different from ordinary erhus. When Sun was alive, whenever he played this erhu, it was like ten thousand horses galloping, like a sudden storm, or like the rising sun, its blazing light illuminating the universe, so it was named Phoenix. Some say it was the erhu of his teacher Jia Sanming Lichun, about eighty years old. Unfortunately, my hand is not strong and my skill is not high, although it is stored in my study, it is like casting a bright pearl in the dark. However, if I encounter a generous and unrestrained song, the sad state of this erhu's sound is like a snow-filled night in a wine shop, and meeting a swordsman, its cheerfulness is indeed gratifying. I wrote this while drunk, and I miss Mr. Sun even more. I will ask a master craftsman to engrave "Sun's Phoenix Erhu" on it to commemorate him, and to let those who obtain this erhu after a hundred years know its value. Recorded on New Year's Day of the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China.</p>
