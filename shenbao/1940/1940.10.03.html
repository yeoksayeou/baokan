<p>社評</p>
<h3>遠東新局勢中的蘇聯與日本</h3>
<p>三國盟的揭布而後，全世界的注意力，不期而集中於地跨歐亞兩洲，且於盟的條款中蒙受特殊保留的蘇聯，將於日形危迫的太平洋局勢中，究竟採取何種動向。三十日眞理報的社評，固已半官式的表明蘇聯對三國締盟的觀點與其中立及和平政策的繼續保持，但中立及和平政策却並不能拘束其從事積極自衛的步驟，一年來東歐所經過的種種事變可資明證。是以揣測蘇聯竟會與英美聯合對日固然不近事實，而把蘇聯看得太消極，甚至惡意的誣其將與三國沆瀣一氣，更屬不倫。然則在彼深沉堅毅的一貫路綫之下，其具體動靜究竟如何，這正是此後遠東半壁安危所繫。</p>
<p>日本之於三國盟的，除却精神自慰而外究具何等實際功效固然大成問題，若以對蘇關係而言則無寗倒是一種損失。三國盟的的第四款規定着並小影響簽字國與蘇聯之現行關係，那只有消極的意義，却絕不能消除此一締盟與蘇聯之間的暗影，或使三國對蘇關係更進一步。而在日本，至今僅有改善對蘇關係的姿態，其遲遲無所舉措正暗示着在日本國內對於此舉還存在着相當阻力，何况兩國間不但相互諒解接近的具體原則尚不曾確立、就連堆積如山的歷來懸案也還無從淸理。是以所謂不影響對蘇關係一語，只有在德國纔具有車大意義·於日本則幾無任何價值可言·如果說在三國私相授受分割歐亞之後，身處歐亞「新秩序」夾縫間的蘇聯到會謙抑有加，和日本順利完成不侵協定的談判，那總是難於想像的事。日本右翼分子最近極注重對蘇關係，並把對蘇親善的實現當做實行南進的先決條件看待。現在蘇日外交並無進步，日本則已置身於空前重大冒險中間，這固緣窘困與貪慾迫其小及坐待；另一方面、亦適足證明三國同盟實以德方利益爲主體，在飢者易爲食的條件之下，日本也就沒有進而選擇於已方更有利的時機的可能。</p>
<p>但是三國同盟雖未改善日本的困難，同時却造成蘇聯的相對孤立。目今國際分野之顯明，幾乎恢復慕尼黑協定以前的情况，只有蘇聯，仍舊無所依傍，單獨置身於民治國與軸心國兩個對立陣綫之外，這在蘇聯，也許是應付目前戰爭危機最便利的立塲，但日益尖銳的國際陣綫對立，究竟能吾容許此一絕對中立態度繼續保持下去，實爲重大疑問。最近雙方列强都展開了對蘇外交戰，各自企圖把蘇聯由中立拉到自已陣營來，縱使蘇聯自身始終不做左右袒，而其一動一靜亦必不免對於雙方列强的進退發生微妙影響。嚴格說來，和平固屬不可分割，中立也不能離開現實而存在，這一點，蘇方當局應該比任何人都明瞭。因此世人之於蘇聯，到不必斤斤於名詞字面之爭，而應該深切注意其實際的動向。</p>
<p>眞理報的社評首先指出德義日三國關係之早已存在，但那却正是針對着蘇聯的反共公的。目前三國敵對的目標顯已不是蘇聯而是英美以及若干弱小民族，但反共公的旣未公布取消，反共公的在三國內部的基礎也未澈底消滅，則蘇聯對軸心國的矛盾在目前縱告緩和，而在軸心國家分割全世界的最後方案中，其將如何位置蘇聯，到是一個饒有興味的問題。固然，未來大戰的結局·參戰者雙方無論勝負，都等於兩敗俱傷，即在戰勝者彼時亦將再無餘力威脅蘇聯。然而這種以萬物爲芻狗的殘酷念頭，總應該不是蘇聯中立及和平政策的本意。</p>
<p>目前世界戰局仍在擴大·且各個分離着的戰爭也有逐漸相互發生聯繫的趨勢，但個中性質絕非帝國主義戰爭擴大一語所能槪括。無論世界戰爭如何發展，中國的英勇抗戰以及因爲反對侵略中國及其他弱小民族而引親的戰事，斷不會掩沒其本身偉大光榮的特殊意義，甚至被歸納到帝國主義戰爭範疇之列，對於這一點，蘇聯根本立塲固小容懷疑，而且連德國都不認爲蘇聯對華之軍事援助與三國同盟有所牴觸，蘇聯更不致因此減弱其對中國抗戰的支援；但是爲了蘇聯自身東疆的澈底的安全，爲了太平洋局勢的澄淸，爲了不負全世界反侵略分子的期許，蘇聯對於任何關於戢止遠東侵略暴行的建議，都值得予以充分考慮，不應因爲免除參加帝國大戰的嫌疑而避之若俛。</p>
<p>總之，遠東局勢已因三國同盟而臨到新的戰爭前夜，太平洋沿岸任何一個國家都無法絕對超身事外。關於遠東前途、除却中國抗戰與英美合作之外，蘇聯是一個最具有決定作用的因素。現在日本的南進慾望雖已擴張到頂點，而在對蘇關係方面却存留着一個重大弱點，這同時也就是遠東的侵略者與反侵略者爭逐的焦點。蘇聯除却保持其一貫立塲而外，更望其能針對現行局勢，於此出於積極態度和措施。</p>

<h3>歐戰叢談　（十）（六）　日常轟炸中　英德民間軼事</h3>
<p>近代戰爭中，空軍的活動佔着極重要的地位。這次歐洲大戰，英德雙方互相轟炸，此來彼去，幾於成爲日常功課。對於眞正軍事上的損失，雙方互守秘密·然而照各方面的情形看起來，英德人民在如此大空襲之下，似乎都沒有屈服的樣子，而且表示了一種堅持到底的態度。茲將紐約泰晤士報所紀英德人民在大轟炸下之動態，譯錄如次：</p>
<p>德國空軍在英國的活動範圍，除了英國的「心臟」及港口以外，就是首都倫敦。轟炸的目標，總不外於飛機塲，工廠，油庫，橋樑，和鐵道。空襲倫教的時候，德機羣總是從東而來，霎時間怪叫的聲昔，和轟炸的聲音，相互雜作，因爲德方爲恐嚇英國人起見，常在彈炸後面附上一個發怪聲的叫子，在它尚未爆炸之前，先來一聲怪叫，令人心胆俱碎。英國的「噴火」式和「暴風」式飛機，立卽騰空迎戰，機槍之聲，在一萬數千尺的高空中，隱的可聞。地上高射砲轟轟的射擊，一分鐘多至數百發。於是房屋塌倒聲，婦孺號哭聲，飛機馬達鼓動聲，紛然雜作。在這種接連不斷的德機空襲之下，英國人的民氣就會渙散麼？從事實上看來，倒也未必呢。在鄉下的婦女們對於轟炸非常鎭定，當晚間被附近炸彈聲警醒時，不多會就聽見婢僕們在鬥上輕輕的敲了幾下，用沉着的語氣說：「太太，請聽炸彈聲吧。」小孩子們也和大人們一樣的很鎭靜，有一個六歲的孩子，一天正在倫敦郊外花園裹玩耍，突然間空中噓而長的一聲怪叫，繼以吼聲，道是德國炸彈將要來的先兆，那孩子却很快活地對大人說道：「那一定是炸彈了。」</p>
<p>英國人在德機空襲之下，究竟作何情狀，這要看空襲發生時環境時間不同而異。在空襲警報尚未發出時，往往德機已出現在雲端中了。所以市民們有時候以敵機的炸彈聲或空戰的景象，作爲唯一的空襲警報。起初，倫敦市民遇着警報時，先慌慌張張的跑向防空壕去，街道中行人一掃而空，公共汽車等完全停駛。除了警察和救護隊以外，他無所見，全市好像急性瘋癱似的，一切都似死去一般。現在呢，這情景有些不同了。市民對於德機空襲早已司空見慣，聽到警報之後，祇有少數人跑進防空壕，累得警察和看守員非要請他們「入洞」不可。路人大有不到臨頭不動脚的氣味。久之，大家聽到警報還是照常工作，直到看見敵機的影蹤，然後開始躱避呢。</p>
<p>沒有看見敵機不亂動，這已成爲一個確切不移的方針了。各兵工廠，一聽到空襲警報，便把探照燈燃亮起來，工人們仍舊照常工作。探照燈如果照到一架敵機直向工廠飛來，那沒再作第二决的緊急警報，大家纔按步就班底走進防空壕</p>
<p>倫敦市中各大商店行家的職員們，往往聽到警報走入防空壕，而結果並無動靜。幾决之後，覺得太麻煩，大家就都懶着走動，在警報聲中仍舊坐着，很安靜地辦公。商行當局雖然反對此種辦法，然而習慣成自然，又有什麼方法呢？所以現在德機儘管在倫教市上空飛翔，而民衆們已不是全行「藏」起來了。</p>
<p>英國「心臟」地帶許多軍火廠工人也是鎭定異常。有一個專門事鍊鋼的工人，生性非常倔强。敵機來襲的時候，別人儘管躱到防空壕去，他却老是不動，仍舊繼續做工。用一盞光綫極微的燈照着，一切無動於中。一次，空襲警報之後不久，別人都已跑光，工塲中祇留他一個人在那裏守着道孤燈工作。霎時間德機一顆燃燒彈穿着屋頂而下。當救火隊聞警到來灌救時，他却夷然地道：「朋友們，你們儘管把火撲滅，却不要連我那盞小燈也把它弄熄，這是我僅有的一支燈光呀！」</p>
<p>倫敦市郊有一家旅館，一天，空襲警報時來了一批新聞記者，剛從前綫回來，預備在那旅館裏進些小食。旅館主人對他們說：「諸君或者吃飯，或者到地室中去，悉聽尊便。我已關照過這裏的侍役，叫他們到防空壕去，但是他們執意不肯，說要侍候諸位呢。」英人對於德機空襲的鎭定情狀，由此更可得見。</p>
<p>就是在防空壕裏，大家也非常定心，一些沒有驚恐的樣子。有時候人數較少，在壁角落裏可以看到兩個人正在下棋。女太太們或是看書，或是做絨綫手工，十分安靜。歡喜吸煩的人，也可以在套室裏抽烟。女打字員及速記員往往曼度一曲，衆人附和而唱，興緻盎然。</p>
<p>還有一種人名爲鎭靜，實則是倔强式的「愚勇」表現。她們往往於敵機已在頭上飛翔的時候，不顧一切，鵠立街頭，望着天空飛機作戰爲樂。弄得不好，一顆槍彈飛來便嗚呼哀哉了？這班人自己死傷了，總算咎由自取，可是他們還耍連累救護隊去做救傷的工作，間接是多生是非。所以當局禁止人們向天空觀看熱鬧，凡是沒有鋼帽子的不准站立街頭·</p>
<p>這種所謂「看熱鬧」的人，不僅城市裏如此，鄉下亦復相同，有些歡喜作野外遝動，或打球的人，他們往往於空戰進行時，仍舊遊玩不輟。倫教郊外一個哥爾夫球塲中，一决有許多人在那裹打球，忽然天空中劈劈拍拍的飛機上放起機關槍來，繼之以炸彈爆發聲。他們玩得起勁，也不去管它。直到一架英國「暴風」式飛機從空中降落塲中，這班人纔打消遊興。</p>
<p>市間經過轟炸之後，常常呈現一種奇突的景象。街道間可以看到幾間房子，前間被炸，後牛間還是很好的存留着，屋子裏的陳設一目了然，這樣子好比一種玩具式的房屋。最奇怪的有時候速鏡子磁器等物還是完整無損。床脚前一套　衣也是摺暈得很好的，未曾走樣。這原因係前半截房子被炸彈的眞空吸力引去，而內部却淡有受到援簪哩。</p>
<p>住在鄉村間的人，又常遇到十分稀奇的事情。有一家住鄉鎮裹的人家，他們有一個姪子在空軍服役。一天，這個姪子在空中利用降落傘下來，到了這村道上，問人家道：「這裏是什麼地方？」他們對他說明之後，他道：「好呀，我這裏有個叔叔呢。」於是這相隔數里外的娃子，便從天而降，出其不意的到他叔叔家裏去歇息了一會。</p>
<p>一個女太太一天正在廚房裏剝豆，預備供膳。門外忽然來了一個從轟炸機中被迫降落的德國航空隊員，她便把他抓住。英國對待被俘的德兵，倒也有個樣子。德兵所最需要的是啤酒與紙烟。如果附近有酒店的話，那沒他們當然先得啤酒。甚革抓住德兵的人，也和他們的俘虜共乾一杯呢。</p>
<p>城市間雖然在空襲之下，死亡枕藉，可是英國民氣非常堅强。被炸的店家鬥口懸上一塊木板，上面寫道：「照常營業。」婦女們往往對人說：「是呀，我們的房子被炸去了，但是一切不必担心，這有什麼關係呢。」在空襲剛完之後，就有人出來做募款工作，救濟被炸的難民。</p>
<p>英國人爲什麼這樣的鎭定呢？這也有個緣故。除了英國人堅强不僥的個性之外，他們對於本國空軍的力量，非常信任。他們一聽見本國空軍擊落德機如何如何多的消息，無不十二分的興奮·他們覺得躱在防空壕「等死」，是懦弱的表示。他們敵愾同仇，非要報復不可。而且老百姓們咸以得與空軍將士們的能够冒險爲榮哩。</p>
<p>至於德國各地遭受英國空軍的襲擊，據英方稱他們的損失「非常重大」；而德方呢，常以「英方完全造謠」爲答。英機以六十架重轟炸機空襲漢堡。英機對於那裏的軍事重要中心，像軍火廠，飛機塲，倉庫，橋梁，路軌，輪埠等，早就瞭如指掌。在「卸貨式」的轟炸之下，那有一處也擊不中之理呢？英軍之與德軍稍異者，就是英空軍以分散式轟炸爲主體，而德人則注重集中式轟炸。</p>
<p>英機對德轟炸，常叫德人感覺十分痛苦。一次，英機襲擊柏林近郊寶勃爾斯堡，死傷的人雖不多，可是一彈下去正中電話局，於是幾天之中，大家弄得消息不通。英軍襲德，以西南兩部遭受轟炸最多，北部决之。英空軍更番前去轟炸，弄得德國人被纒不休，司令部索性出了個佈告道：「嗣後如遇敵機一架來襲時，不再發空襲警報，以免工業中心區市民感受紛擾。」</p>
<p>五月十七日至七月八日間，漢堡曾受英機空襲二十八次。多的時候一天三次，損失據說也不少。但據德方宣稱，英機十架中祇有一架能衝過火網，所以無重大損失。魯爾區居民遭受英機騷擾最利害，差不多沒有一晚得以安睡。尤以午夜早晨的空熙最爲難堪，從上午二時至四時，一聞警報，大家從床上起來，趕緊躱入防空壕。日久成爲習慣，差不多到了這時候，便自動的到防空壕報到去了。</p>
<p>九月初，柏林受到英機的連續空襲，利害的時候，市民要在防空壕中睡上十二小時。因爲不當心或偶然着冷的關係，許多人受了流行性感冒。柏林中心一家藥房，在英機空襲的一個星期中，咳嗽片，傷風藥，出售一空。爲了預防受寒的緣故、柏林市民後來聽到空襲警報，便在身上披上大衣，然後步入防空壕。</p>
<p>魯爾區的防空壕，各式傢具齊備，允其是小孩子用的床，也佈置在這地下室中。一到天黑，他們便把小孩子帶入壕中度夜，直到翌早爲止。西部區域的德人鎭靜程度也頗可叫人佩服。有一對夫婦已屆銀婚紀念之期，因爲鑒於時局艱難，想不舉行慶祝。一天，正值空襲警報大鳴，夫婦倆步入防空壕，看見裏面已爲他們預備好了慶祝的塲面。原來他們所住的公寓中，幾個芳鄰知道空襲警報按時而來，歷試不爽，故而就在防空壕中舉行慶祝，大家盡歡而散。</p>
<p>柏林西區却洛登堡一個防空壕中，九月二十五夜間，有一個年二十一歲的靑年婦人在裏面產生了一個孩子，幸虧紅十字會所訓練的女看護知道收生之方，所以母子皆安。這是防空壕中的創聞了。（完）（上）轟炸中的倫敦居民（下）被燬房屋</p>

<h3>德間諜與便衣隊活動的全貌</h3>
<p>美團驗軍上校杜拿佛和新聞記者穆勒兩人，奉美國海軍部長路諾克斯之命　在歐洲調查德國間諜活動情形，歸而繼具報告，洋洋灑灑，不下數萬言。其中對於德國便衣隊（即所謂第五機隊）組織，活動範圍及功效，紀述　詳·茲根據諾克斯所表的全文，　述大要如次：</p>
<p>德國間謀和便衣隊工作的妙用何在，可從希特勒口中得到結論。他會晚：「我們固然需要軍隊，但不必像－九一四年大戰時那樣去用乓。將來大砲的功用可由大加改革的宣傳方決來代普，在軍隊沒有開始作戰之前，在心理方面先使敵人喪膽落魄，沒有交戰，即想投降…………我們的武器在使敵方精神恍惚，疑遲不決，驚惶失措。世界上的革命史……如出一轍：統治階級總是先投降。為什磨呢？原來失敗心理早在那裹作祟，他們竟一籌莫展了。」</p>
<p>「有錢能使鬼推磨」，德國的間諜和便衣隊機關每年要化上兩萬萬美元之钜．去「推動」全部的秘密工作。它的組織以國社黨為中心，以一海外組織都」、為工具。這一部的「同志」做在外國各地的多至四百萬人，都是幹練有為的俊才。在全世界四十五國中，地方支部共有六百處。總部在德國斯圖加特，－切部務由外交部一個司長叫做柏美的總其成。他手下另有屬員助手約八百人。海外地方支部的名義，並不一律，成以當地的環境為轉侈，總之「巧立名目，善為掩餓」這八個字可以包括一切。在這從事閒蹀與便衣隊工作的四百萬人之中，有真正的德國人，有「中立化」的日耳憂人，更有非德國人。所謂「中立化」的日耳曼人者。係寄居在外國，僅可取得所在國的國籍，美國籍或葡萄牙籍都好，但是他原來的德國籍扔舊可以不喪失。「且有事，神不知鬼不覺的，裹應外合，就是這些人。五十年前在外國所生的小孩子，柏林政府到現在還承認他們屬德國籍。凡能「效忠」於德鼠的人，即不是德國人，國社黨也視之如懷寶，到處搜羅延攪，大有「求賢若渴」乏感。要是德國人所視為「同一血統」的外國人，像斯干的那維亞，荷蘭，弗萊芒，講德語的瑞士人，甚至盎格魯薩克森人，那更情同手足，借重之處格外的多了。</p>
<p>在德國間謀組織之大洪爐中，實際上另有七個組織，同隸於這「個旗幟之下。它們是：政治秘密警察，戈培爾的宣傳部，勞工陣線，海陸空軍情報部，外交部駐各地的使領館，這些機關每年用於特務工作，宣傳，偵探及　勸等專的費用，總數達二萬萬美元。這一筆鉅款真是可觀得很，但是希特勒情願裁減陸軍步兵，而不欲吝異暈種支出。因為拆穿了講，這種三萬人的龐大組織代希特勒所造就的幾種偉大勝利，卻所化的代價與所收的實利相比絞，真不可以道里計。好像做生常一般，「一本萬利」庶乎近之。</p>
<p>各支部人數雖多，組織和紀律到處一樣，他們以忠於德國，為希特勒服務，作為唯一的信條。為達到道目的起見，各種手段，如詐欺，威脅，恐怕，甚華殺人等事，無所不用其極。處終海外的德國便衣隊，常由他們的總部指示，叫他們服從所在國的法律。不過最重要的，還在以德國勝利可操左券的言論，常常灌輸在所在國人民的頭腦中。</p>
<p>德國海陸空軍情報部，其組織功用和別國大同小異。所比較特殊的，就是他們另有「心理實驗」組，活動範圍頗廣，在國際方面不僅訓練間諜，海外的秘密警察支部，和黨支部籌的秘密工作，也都脫胎於這一組。工人的活動方面，自，一九三六年以來，漢堡設立了一個「國際中央局」，德讓兩國通力合作，在民治國中算做破壞工運的工祚。德國勞工陣線各份子，如在外國工作，常以外國船舶，商店，工廠情況，</p>
<p>世界各國中所有德大使館和領事館的情戰參贊，都主持著重要的宣傳工作。在各國所出的德文日報共一千七百種，銷數三百禹份，他們常以重價收買各種文稿，載刊報上。此外又注意到當地的德方無線電播音工作。連絡當地報紙，對反希特勒的報紙雜誌，施以擊中傷，都楚他們的主要任務</p>
<p>德國殖民地政治部主任李德愛普將軍，專管各國殖民地的宣傳工作，如果有關十分機密的工作，政治警察部常常直接派入進行一切。一到時局緊張的時候，地們專門注意在某一重要地方，集中力量去工柞。聽說有一個德籍無線電專家，設法在美國一家播音電台上找到一個不甚重要的位置，混在裏面和德國總部私通消息，還有專既與前線兵士通訊的秘密組織。德國問謀機關又常利用外國人住宅中的德籍侍女。刺探主人的謂息·有－個荷蘭人，一次雇到一個「耳聾」的德籍廚娘。－天忽聽見她在廚中和一個非常陌生的人用流利的「牛津」韻調談話。他知道出了蹊蹺，運忙把那女侍辭去，可是她臨走的時候，幾種重要文件也不翼而飛了。德國人又利用青年學生報告消息，他們被派到外國去留學，或和別國學生交換讀書，在未出國門之前，先受一番間謀調練。他日學成返國，也就不　報國無方了</p>
<p>在道次歐洲大戰中，凡是戰敗國歲　　波。挪。丹。法等國，那、國沒有受到德國便衣隊之「賜」。其中弄得欺巧妙，而希特勒認為最得意的，自然莫過於法蘭西的屈服了。孫子說：「知己知彼，百戰百勝」。德國人對於法國的一切實在太熟悉太「內行了」。於是　了過最適富的時間，一下子敲下去，法蘭西儘多謀士，僅多狀丁，那里敵得過穗人日積月累所下的苦工。法國即使有堅強的馬廳諾攻線，那能不給搖動的民心所摧毀？何況法國的軍事佈置又不及德國遠甚。</p>
<p>德國人之謀法國，即在間諜一方面論，亦會「長線放遠　」的下個一番忍耐工夫。在行動機敏組織周密的間諜之外，他們再利用絕色女子，作為香餌。像馳譽交際社會的尤物愛南姆羅男爵夫人，盎妮蘿公主等都是脂粉隊中的翹楚。憑著她們的「色」，已叫人家色授魂予，難以自持，何況她們又都受過相當的訓練呢。她們一和幾個主要人物勾搭上之後，還不乘機儘量把「失敗心理的唱片」，一張一張的渦輪在她們「情俘」的腦海深處。他們並利用被收買的報紙，造為「不抵抗，安國家」的妙論。於是法蘭西的政界人物，起初覺得德國人的宣傳是對的，後來俞聽俞覺得合理了。他們隨入德方的間諜「陷阱」之中，就永無超生之日了。德國間諜的口號，對於法國人總是說：要是法國能放棄與英國及蘇聯做朋友，不干涉德國在中歐與東歐的行動，而以一部份無關重要的土地讓與義大利，法德就能「睦誼互敦」相安無事了。遠拉第總理在開戰兩個月之前，所昭示於世人的，倒也虎虎有生氣，前途大有可為的樣子。那知眼睛一　，全盤變卦。雷大雨點小，真是達公之謂也。</p>
<p>德人在英國所做的間諜宣傳工夫，也不算少。最著者像無線電廣播中的「哈哈爵士」，每晚在空中大播其不利於英人的消息，想把英國人的心弄糟起來。行賄收買，英人為德張目之事雖亦不會沒有，可是比了在法國所收的成效，恐怕要大見遜色了。戰前數年，德人在英國民間著實做過親善友好的工作。德人在英成立了幾個增進英德的會團甚至聯德親德的口號發自英人嘴中，德國人又招待英國紳士太太們赴德遊覽，看看希特勒的德政，並派許多高貴俊美的少年與她們為伴，充當導遊。然而英國的警察也是不易予的，曾有一次要拘捕與德方私通危害國家消息的國會議員拉姆賽。自經張伯倫聘德，和平決裂，戰事爆發，英人對於德國的第五縱隊活動情形大為注意。開戰之初警察曾拘捕了著名的德間諜四百餘人。通過了這次肅清工作之後，德國在英的間諜活動自　少殺。但是黃牌英之期瑞尚未屆。空間是否尚有「奇　突起」之處，只好留之將來再論了。</p>
<p>希特勒在這次戰事中所表現的，十不離九多是「夏日多奇雲」的作風。即以他的作戰武器作戰方式而論，總是乘人不備，當頭一棒的手法。空襲時炸彈上附以怪叫發音器，進攻時大炮幾百　集中轟擊，不要說初出茅　的新兵嚇得魂不附體，就是老於戎行的也見之失色哩。併吞捷克時的蘇臺德德人，那一套戲法，世人早已拆穿。接連而來的為減波，侵挪，攻丹，犯荷，襲法等一貫作風。總算一帆風順，利市三倍。</p>
<p>德人混在波蘭的間諜為數著實可觀。他們都受秘密警察的指導，視為實業家，推銷旅行商，侍者，車夫，深入波蘭人之中，而做那反間諜報的工作。此外又有百萬號稱效忠於波蘭的人民，而實則在做拆臺腳的工作。戰事發生之前夕，這班受柏林指使的德人，先與波人為難，造成所謂「不幸事件」。其他德人了波兵在鄉村中造成恐怖局面。能操波語的德人，偽造命令，在無線電中「指揮」一切，還有些人在軍事目標處向德國空軍送訊，引他們來轟炸。德人自己　如果波軍再能支持兩星期的話，準可造成對德消耗戰的場面呢。</p>
<p>挪威丹麥的相繼淪陷，也是德國便衣隊的收穫所造成。荷蘭的攻陷尤為他們精心之作。進攻荷蘭之日，德人掩藏在大艇船中，佔據了荷蘭著名的摩亞堤大橋。於是德軍不費吹灰之力，就解決了南面的戰事。還有十二萬德人住在荷蘭各地裏應外合遂成不可收拾之勢，在戰前德國在海牙的官吏二百五十人，又籍著外交上的特殊優待條例，作一切活動的張本。至於其他領事署人員尚不計在內。互十至一百的號稱德新聞記者，到處在荷蘭來往，視察軍事地形，及經濟研究工作。德籍　役隨時向他們的主人刺探消息，抄錄文件，報告本國。德軍一進荷境，這班人把紅色的證章拿了出來，做軍隊的嚮導。</p>
<p>寄居比利時的德人約六萬名，戰事爆發後，他們首先破壞比利時頭道防線阿爾勃運洵。這六萬人另受外交上，商界及美術界方面的德人指導，造成了有力的危害比國的各種團體組織。及至比王宣佈屈服，早先大事不可為了。其他關於德國便衣隊的奇積，真是　筆難書，不過其原理及手法，都和上述者大同小異。</p>
<p>美海軍總長諾克斯說：「大抵抗敵人的軍事侵犯外，其次便是防禦敵人的宣傳。」諾克斯之重視間諜活動盡可知矣。（完）</p>

<h3>受時局影響　紗市不安　紗廠相率减工　絲廠什九停閉</h3>
<p>工部局工業科　九月份報告稱、上月間、本市工業界經濟情形、未見好轉、一大部份紗廠、除星期日已告停工外、上月並已停止星期六之工作、將來恐仍有繼續减工之可能、滙率之低落、引起投機家之購買、但其趨勢已受市民購買力薄弱之影響、鮮繭仍無到貨、絲廠在工作者、僅有兩家、其中一家、卽將停工、若干染廠、因時令發展之關係、已告復工、但恐爲期不久、電珠廠若干家、亦已復工、忙於製造聖誕節所用之小電泡、一般小資本工業、大都因缺乏現款、購買原料、同時存貨出售之所得、爲數有限、故吃虧不少、此外本埠工業界因內地限制原料運滬、以及禁止滬貨運往內地之故、感受影響匪淺、</p>
<p>據聞自德義日三國簽訂盟的後、此間棉紗界中人、深恐遠東將有戰爭發生、故棉紗之輸入、幾已完全停止、目下本埠各紗廠所存棉紗、僅足三個月之用、但日方報紙所稱、中英日三國商人之紗廠、明年初或將被迫停閉一節、則未免言之過甚、目下紗市之情形、甚不安定、前途如何、無人能預料之、據外商某大棉紗進口行經理稱、華紗進入上海極困難、蓋因種種限制、使華紗無法永續輸入、且單靠華紗、亦決不能應付本市各紗廠之需求也、</p>

<p>昨日創新高價</p>
<p>米行茶會市塲昨晨循例於七時半開做後、市况混　異常、人心忐忑不安、投機米　愈趨活躍、猛抬市價、不遺餘力、情勢倐緊倐鬆、結果國米開價竟達九十六元一石大關、此種新高峯滬市歷所罕見、惟大都暗盤成交、顧客號各買戶、終因開價太高、無意繼續吸納、成交不多、</p>
<p>麵粉供應辦法</p>
<p>上海市機製切麵業同業公會、全市會員共同達三百七十六家之多、惟因大宗麵粉被人囤積居奇、以致市上現貨缺乏、該會全體會員莫不發生恐慌、嗣卽推派代表向公共租界工部局請願、茲已由何副總辦設法就緒、四家麵粉店同意、卽源豐五商得百包、萬豐八百包、同盛昌四百包、丁厚記三百卅包、共計二千零卅包、供給各切麵店應用、茲切麵價格已規定每市斤三角四分、並不得超越此項限價、</p>

<h3>馬路積水漸退　今日天氣放晴　濬浦工作荒廢阻碍宣洩　低窪地點昨仍積水沒脛</h3>
<p>此次滬市大水、其原因爲潮汛遇風、加以豪雨傾注、但馬路積水亘兩日未退盡、厥爲濬浦工作荒廢、以致無法官洩、本埠濬浦局之挖泥船、在一九三七年淞滬抗戰爆發時、均被日方恃强取去、經濬浦局與日當局數度交涉後、雖有一部份已交還、被扣未還者仍不少、過去數月中、濬浦局之挖泥工作、雖略有進行、遠不及正常時期內之成績、聞濬浦局方面、仍在繼續向日當局交涉、以便收回全部挖泥之設備、</p>

<p>各處水勢</p>
<p>本市大水後僅福煦路及愛多亞路因無積水均變為交通孔道、　煦路自邁爾西愛路以東完全無積水、愛多亞路則全部乾燥、福煦路西段車輛亦通行無阻、惟西摩路交叉處積水頗深、大西路海格路以西、則積水成渠、靜安寺路自赫德路至虞洽鄕路一段、亦患積水、靜安寺路各商店、事前未堆沙袋、致遭水浸、損失不貲、派克路口之福利公司、下層水深九英寸、先施水人下層店面、無法營業、永安新新悄形則較佳、仍能照常營業、百老滙路及匯山路若干處、雖有若干地帶水深一尺、虹口交通、仍照常通行、南市各區電燈前因遭颶風疾擊、電綫摧毀殆盡、各處頓成黑暗世界、同時自來水亦斷、直至前晚八時許、始恢復原狀、租界內各校有臨時停課者、但大都上課、惟不到者不作缺課論、第一特院因爲地勢較低、昨晨院內院外的積有雨水二尺餘深、出入法院之公務員及訴訟當事人、均係赤足、刑事犯人昨亦不覊押拘留室、由囚車直接押送至應解之法庭、</p>
<h3>泛舟圖</h3>
<p>昨日滬市天色陰沉暴雨已歇、然馬路積潦、宣洩無從，行人涉水而過、猶復沒脛、雖無在風暴雨之　擊、但交通被阻、往往咫尸之遙、儼若蓬山萬里車行其間、激盪成波、潮音隱的、生於足下、圖示法租界邁爾西愛路之積水、一美國水兵携西婦泛舟其間、舟子搖艣、路人側上上、蔚為異觀、盡陸地生舟之怪事、抑亦上海數十年來稀有之景象也、</p>

<h3>吳高友被殺案　三犯供述經過　正兇朱根水在逃未獲　朱父與死者結有深仇</h3>
<p>蘇州人吳高友、今年五十二歲、住法租界霞飛路寳康里五十九號、在新聞報館包碎紙爲生、手中頗有積蓄、上月廿五日下午十時許、在家中吞雲吐霧、突被人甩刀砍斃、事後經捕房派幹探鄔鶴林調查毫無眉目、直至上月廿六日、始偵悉吳高友係其子吳國樑（今年廿五歲）串同朱根水·潘阿大（今年廿五歲·蘇州人·住貝勒路望志路昌興里二十七號·業糞夫·）所殺害、乃將吳國樑吳妻王氏（廿七歲蘇州人）潘阿大逮捕、朱根水則已聞風潛逃、</p>
<p>出事經過</p>
<p>經捕房詳加偵查、至昨午始將吳等三名解送特二法院刑一庭、捕房律師袁家潢以被告等爲殺人案件被捕、因偵查尙未完畢、請求展期、繼據承辦探員鄔鶴林陳遠本案起因、略謂、本年八月十五日下午十時許、霞飛路捕房報告偵探處、謂霞飛路寳康里五十九號、有人被暴徒砍斃、當派我前往調查、始悉被害人名吳高友、</p>
<p>主犯在逃</p>
<p>出事時、正在吸食鴉片、惟其子等咸默不發表意見、故未有結果、後至九月廿六日、始經人密告、本案實因死者之子吳國樑不堪其父虐待、乃串同朱根水買出潘阿大、代價六百元、事後潘阿大被流氓敲詐去二百八十元、實到手三百二十元、捕房根據報告、卽將吳國樑潘阿大拘獲、吳王氏因事前亦參加　見、故一併逮捕、惟主犯朱根水逃逸、無從拘捕、</p>
<p>結下仇恨</p>
<p>誥之潘阿大供稱、此事全由朱根水一人獨做、我雖跟朱同去、惟未動手、死者共被砍達二三十刀、據朱根水告訴我、他父親向在新聞報館服務、經吳高友之攛掇、他父親生意辭歇、後來他父親回鄕病故、報館當局發下一千元、又被吳高友私自吞沒、故朱恨之刺骨、欲將吳高友置之死地而甘心、故出此下策、我與朱根水係表兄弟、他雖邀我參加、我因怕事、始終宋實際參加、</p>
<p>吳國樑供</p>
<p>吳國樑供稱、吳高友是我父親、母已早死、有一繼母、父親向住前樓、我住亭子間、父親平時待我尙稱不惡、在出事前一星期、朱根水來向我稱、他父親與我父親因爲爭奪新聞報館生意、結下寃仇、最近朱根水欲我父親介紹職業、我父親不允、他更恨之刺骨、非置之我父親死地不可、我當時對朱根水勸解、此事不可做、但是朱根水非常堅決、叫我不必干涉、無論何事、他一人負担、後來在八月十五日、果然朱根水做出此事、</p>
<p>翁媳不睦</p>
<p>不過此事我妻王氏事前得悉、曾一度與朱根水商量過、因爲王氏生有一子（五歲）一女（三歲）、而一切開支、我父全不給付、致翁媳間感情不甚和睦、朱根水動手時、係由後門進來、故我全不知情、迨捕房得報來調查、兇手朱根水其時尙未逃走、在樓下坐着、惟朱曾威嚇我、不許我聲張、吾則與我不利、故我未報告探員、將朱逮捕、末據吳王氏供稱、吳高友是我公公、是朱根水喚人謀死的、</p>
<p>吳王氏供</p>

<p>糯米國洋兩貨均無到貨、際期他貨於飛黃騰達之問、一致步起、比前亦好一元、開金溧特元七十四元、常丹貨七十二三元、香港貨高自七十四元、决至七十元左右、糯茶粉坯銷路頗廣、均好元奇、售六十五元半、决至六七三元半、一價祇十六元五角</p>
<h3>洋粉定二千噸　價祇十六元五角</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日平穩如常、查二號粉廠盤站定十六元五角、除供給本街日常需用外、迄無大額批出、實總洋麥成本昂大、合價須在十八元以上、故廠方歡迎供給客銷、而限制木街零批、致目下現粉仍感缺乏、惟回籠貨老車棧單及洋粉價格、經前日一度提緊、昨聞本街行商續定澳洲洋粉二千噸價祗十六元五角、雖非現貨、而人心不免帶餒、更兼天雨潮發、馬路幾成澤國、故成交淸淡、而市局轉告平穩、</p>
<p>小麥　續吿清淡、因天雨各種雜糧交易清稀、在租界供應者、更見寥落、除前兩日內地帮辦過太倉新麥一百包外、客銷暫無問津、日廠與華廠偶有零星收進者、價亦與前相埒、</p>
<h3>金融　港幫兼售英金美匯</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯唁市、走勢平庸、先微緊後終告鬆、乃盛傳美日經濟絕交所致也、晨初雖某外埠銀行電吸、而華商投機家頗肯塞出、且繼因港電對美匯先令均有賣出、市面反呈鬆象、但照收盤價五元五三一二五、難結難賣、故美匯與隔昨相較、實不分軒輊、先令更平、期貨與現貨無異、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>中途突見轉鬆</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠期均平、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬均未更動、美對英跌七一八七五、對滬小八分、對法無市、中央掛脾各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士五一五六二五、美滙五元半、較之上日晚收、英美兩匯俱平、開後因香港國貨銀行電購、且吃胃甚健、致市面帶緊、斯時華商投機家曾塞予華行及外行本月份美匯五元四六八七五、聞最緊已見過五元四三七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉、亦無增减、此後港電售予外行先令現貨價爲三辦士半、並吐予某美行暨英行有利本月份美匯五元四六八七五、潛勢堪稱平穩、迨近午、刻未有重大變化、華商投機家續售與外行及有利本月份美匯五元半、但收盤突告硬化、英金三辦士五一五六二五、美匯五元五三一二五、本月份與現貨同價、十一月份英金三辦士半美匯五元半、比上日英金期現悉無榮辱、美匯微長〇三一二五、午後週三無市、一</p>
<p>香港二日（週三電、今晨滙市開盤吿平、英匯現貨仍無變動、美匯現貨縮一二五、爲廿三元三一二五、申匯現貨升二元、爲四百廿六元、日匯現貨緊半元、爲一百〇五元牛、九時三十五分微鬆、美匯現貨回長一二五、爲廿三元四三七五、十時肝分告鬆、美匯現貨續鬆〇六二五、為廿三元半、十一時三十分吿平、申匯現貨回降一元五角爲四百廿四元五角、其餘不動、下午週三無市、</p>
<p>天津英美緊縮</p>
<p>天津一日（週三）電、今晨匯市開盤吿平、英匯現貨緊〇三一二五、爲三辦士四〇六二五、美匯現貨縮一五六二五、爲五元三一二五、由匯微降二角五分、爲一百〇三元二角五分「聯紗」晤盤續昂三元五角、爲八十一元七角五分、</p>
<h3>金市終吿不支　破入五千九百元關</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、復告挫落、惟跌勢尚緩、乃一般多頭不乏乘賤、略有加碼、晨開因滙市緊俏、故價隨之堅昂、嗣傳美將對日經濟絕交、外匯由平而鬆、買戶口缺少鼓勵、裹足不前、終以供求不勻、破入九百元關內、最賤曾告五千八百五十元、收盤則爲五千八百五十五元、比隔昨收市軋低五十元、午後週三無市、半日交易尚旺、的二千餘兩、銀樓飾金終則掛小十元、關金等仍平、</p>
<p>結果軋跌五十元</p>
<p>晨初以外滙報軟、價遂猛抬、銀號進金號十兩、五千九百五十元、作爲開盤價、且證券幫卽來搜入、繼升十元、計證券幫入金號二十兩爲五千九百六十元、嗣因金銀號聯袂吐出、價卒回挫、金號塞予銀號三十兩、五千九百三十元、但錢兌業蓄意撈購、乃重被拉起數十元、計銀號進證券幫二十兩、五千九百五十元、時聞外滙漸平、金銀號續出、猛撳入九百元關、內金號出證券幫二十兩、五千八百八十五元、幸賴錢兌業曁另一銀號多頭加碼、復出九百元關外、銀號曾對做十兩、爲五千九百二十元、奈因證券幫金號銀號等俱來拋塞、供求不敵、價仍降落、金號出證劵幫十兩、五千八百六十元、後略盤旋、銀號入證券幫二十兩、爲五千八百八十元、將近午刻銀號對做二十兩、跌至五千八百五十元、爲全日最低價、結果金號入銀號十兩、五千八百五十五元、作收盤價、較上日軋跌五十元、現金號之本脾余售價較烚赤高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌低五十餘元、均鮮做開、銀樓有飾金每兩兌出、農初仍懸六百十元、迨全午刻掛小十元、計大同行懸六百元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣大都回落</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤一漲卽跌、英美金鎊亦係先漲後落、終一降一元、英金票需要不弱、市價漲起五角、美金票始曾高至十八元一角三分、旋因關於美日經濟絕交之流言甚盛、致各方供給忽旺、市價步落、晚市退至十七元八角、比上日終落二角、香港票略有需要、市價微漲一分、日金票供給未减、市價續降一分半、晚市退爲一元四角六分、朝鮮票趨勢仍挺、晚市升爲一元一角八分、</p>
<h3>南北貨　棉紅棗獻新</h3>
<p>首批天津棉紅棗到四十餘包、身色俱尚可觀、以初次見新、愈覺稀罕、旋以六十元如數開通、又府紅棗叉到二十餘包、以四十五元成盤、</p>
<h3>活期存款之減息</h3>
<p>— 介希</p>
<p>溯自八一三戰事發生，一般銀行，當時均紛紛受擠提風潮，停市數天，財部鑒此情形，急頒布限制提存辦法，以安金融，蓋此時銀行貸款於工商方面者，爲數甚巨。一時欲向索催還，實非容易，而存於行者，又紛來提取，無米之炊，巧婦亦拙。迨部令頒到，遂得以安定。</p>
<p>厥後戰事西移，內地居民遭烽火之累，有產階級，繹絡避難來滬，資金亦與之俱蒞，於是用之搭貨囤積者，外匯投機者，風起雲湧，銀行老存戶，覩之生羨，紛紛提取，遂續有「馬電」之限制命令，此時長期存戶滿期以後，恒轉短期（一二年）及活期，殊有利息原非所計，祇求活動便利，無礙於本金安全之概，其付去劃頭票據，轉存外商銀行者，核計交換所中總數，巨大可驚，外商之給息，活期僅一二厘，支票戶僅一厘或不計，存數過小勿收，過大减息，雖種種苛刻，而國人願之，其不斤斤於利息之多寡，實已爲一般存戶心理矣。</p>
<p>去今兩年間中，資金移來滬上，日有增加，銀行放款，殊少適當之對象，收存無限，多增貼息之暗耗，蓋冐險外滙標金之投機，有身價之銀行，均不願爲，而穩妥滙票套利之投資，又爲一般活期存戶所趨。所扯利率在四厘以上，提款自向套做，扯息在四厘以下，復以之存行而取四厘活息，致銀行自身，在巨大套利之下，因需預備活存提款頭寸，不敢套做，在四厘以下，雖能套做，以稍减擱殺拆息，而九九歸原，註定之暗耗，勿能免焉。</p>
<p>物價蒸蒸日上，銀行開支，亦隨之俱增，恃存放利息之差額，所餘能有幾何，鑒游資之不减，活存之日增，遂有减低利率之議，屢經共同商討，乃各定實行之期，首先發出通知者，爲浙江實業，繼之者上海銀行，今報載中南金城鹽業大陸及該叫行合辦之儲蓄會等，下月起亦有减低活期利率一厘之訊，在銀行爲鞏固地位，减少暗耗，固不可非難，至促使活期轉定期長期，俾資金固定，便於內移，則允盼存款人自身顧全大局矣。（九·二九·）</p>
<h3>證券　內債均見新高價　外股非常岑寂</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市傳聞日本公債大跌之反映、人氣益見昂騰、一時因空頭抵補及做多加碼、各種市價冉衝出九月三十日最高價、而發現最高新紀錄、甲種穿出六元、乙種逼近六十元大關、丙種穿出八元、丁種亦衝出七兀、收盤時浮多獲利了結、回小二三角、形勢甚佳、市價雖邁進不已、但與市上仟何物品及金子外匯外股等稍一比擬、乃覺瞠乎其後、惟曲折必多、不可不預爲之備也、昨日走勞、上午初疲後堅、甲種高達六元、午後吃戶非常踴躍、各種行市一路上騰、皆見最新高價、買賣方面、以六號及信孚胃量最佳、餘如鼎康同順怡泰久孚等及一般散戶、紛紛補空、但聯和上午均有吐出、同康樂茂恒康等均有賣出、故收盤已稍回鬆、結果續漲一二角至四角、成交總數共計一百七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交康元製罐廠五十股、價為九元八角、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市開盤甚穩、入後漸轉黯澹、蓋謠傳怡和股之派中期息尚非其時、同時政局發展猶無定向、市况起伏在一種狹隘範疇內、咋日本市積水未退、各公司寫字問中、甚鮮顧主足跡、此爲市况岑寂之又一因、</p>
<p>倫敦一日（週二）電、今日中國外債及遠東英各公司股票掛牌行市、仍告平滯、銀行股則漲跌參見、麥加利銀行股漲二先令六便士、價爲六鎊十五先令、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股跌一鎊半、價爲六十五鎊半、又香港註冊股跌一鎊、價爲七十一鎊、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>紗花　現紗首起拉提　既而無「帽」可搶</h3>
<p>紗市先漲後跌、局勢漸入徘徊之境、此因價格已較低盤時高漲二三百元、一批獲利者暫告脫手求財、惟有一部份因原料來源困難、心思看好允甚、吸收之額始終不願放棄、所以雙方拉抬殊劇、至於賞銷方面、香港幫對於十支粗紗納胃尚健、其他採辦較滯矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因上日午後人氣緊昂、一般浮多突來拉提、首盤做至一千一百十七元、詎料大戶某某等來機出籠、但買方喊聲仍震耳、故此價一千一百十幾元爲時甚久、旋後聞全市平席、外匯軟化、一般搶帽子之輩、認爲無帽可搶、市象上下不大、迨至收盤時、跌至一千〇九十五元、查半日間成交統計四千九百四十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌五元、茲將各幫口買去之額量分別如左、</p>
<p>現棉情形尚屬平靜、廠方略有需要、故人心尚平、不過外匯放長、外棉市態未升、所以人心尚平庸、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、市况殊爲靜寂、後因一部份華爾街之賣出、結果收盤價格較之上日稍跌一二磅音、印度跌落三羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊見活躍、允以長織維者爲最、各方深悉外棉來源之將絕、且海外棉市高於滬上之售價、每擔尚高三十餘元、廠方因對該項原棉存底之不豐、乃競相購買、故存底益見稀少矣、一般預料、棉市將繼續猛漲也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　內地絲價奇廉　滬上可望而不可接</h3>
<p>昨紐的絲市現貨報漲、日絲八五·七五分、每鎊各漲八分、近遠期尚無上落、蓋受日美政治局勢尖銳刺激所致也、橫濱現貨漲五元、遠期三月份未拍開、十二月份爲一四〇四元、</p>
<p>本埠絲市昨呈思動之象、惟手貨有限、持價甚堅、現白廠七八分持價爲五二〇〇元、輯里經特絲三七〇〇元、聞洋行心意遷就、可望相當接近、又內地絲價奇廉、因最近月餘、生絲出運受阻、錫地白廠僅三二〇〇－三五〇〇元許、惟滬地求之不得、可望不可接耳、</p>
<h3>五金　華印生鐵絕跡　美鐵起而代之</h3>
<p>生鐵出產、除我國六河溝及印度俄國外、最近美國亦有所裝來、蓋是貨我中華國產早吿斷檔、（查自全面抗戰發動後、運輸即告中絕、故無貨裝滬）而俄國貨在市塲流通者、爲數寥寥、問津者亦稀、而其中能奪國貨地位者、非印度生鐵莫屬、故一時市　莫不以印貨是問、致交易日廣、惟自歐戰擴大後、印度出產之生鐵、供英國軍需而不足、安有現貨運滬、茲悉市上現貨軋缺、故花旗產之生鐵、乘機而起、洛續有現貨裝來、在此物以稀爲貴之市塲中、行情異常高昂、頭號貨須開八百七十元至八十元不等、是以實銷方面、因價貴而益感呆滯耳、緯綸老虎圖、天翔仙鶴圖、國產寬緊條素駱駝羢、昨日　批市價每碼皆售十一元五角、維一雙鹿圖美術駝羢售七元二角半、素色六元半、條子五元七角半、什牌普通齊喊沽五元左右、以革六七元不等、多半齊看身骨花色爲轉移、觀邇來該類各種寬緊駱駝羢、市銷已見狂落、蓋醜者易於脫毛、質薄未能若何禦塞、好者售價太昂、每單尺須剪售二元以上、呢羢業經售者、回顧二三年前已减少一半、綢緞洋貨幫去路、亦遠不如前之暢旺、但爲客路運輸不通、川埠及華北幫未能裝辦亦一大關係也、以致近日範圍較大之駝羢廠家、相率多帶做呢羢、而範圍較小者漸多停業、</p>
<h3>疋頭　一千四百件　運往烟台威海衛</h3>
<p>連日疋頭北運尚多、今日有一百十件運往威海衛、一千一百件運往烟台、</p>
<h3>糖市　本廠冰小元許</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢平軟微有鬆落、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白無甚更動、本棧七十八元半、外棧七十八元、轉口貨六十一元九角、比上週小元許、荷赤　嘜六十元、DY嘜五十九元六角、荷棉白BS嘜七十五元、太古車白僅角許上落、B嘜七十五元九角、DY嘜七十三元九角、HX嘜七十三元六角、本廠一號冰一百元、晶明冰一百〇一元牛、均小一元半、</p>
<p>事變以後，中國絲業卽呈極度混亂，最後之結果，華人獨資不得經營大規模之工廠，於是從業於蠶絲者，大部份職工幾至坐以待斃，後經上海租界區絲廠，先後創立，方有一部份人員獲得舊業，而失業員工，仍逾數萬，旋經彙集少數資金，組織小型製絲工塲，每塲的排車二十部左右，戰後之失業人員，方在艱難中度着這困的日子，在這一年中因成本低廉，開支節目，故經營尚稱順利，然社會秩序尚未安靜，四鄕工場，時聞盜刦，經營頗感辣手：有不得已而停車者，至於上海租界絲廠，因器械精良，規模宏大，且職工均能安心工作，至年終結帳，獲利驚人</p>
<p>去年乾繭驟迺禁運，租界各廠因無法獲得原料，只得忍痛相繼停辦，僅少數廠家，設法運得浙東乾繭，繼續繅製，而多數員工，復遭失業之苦，嗣後絡續遷回內地，爲維生計，不得不以化整爲零之姿態，合資經營小型製絲工塲，籍度難關，於是風起雲湧，極一時之盛，營業方面，因外銷暢達，匯價縮短，故經營絲業者，獲空前之巨利，惟吾人所得者，實爲殘羹耳。</p>

<p>教育</p>
<h3>推翻教育營利制度　一種新學校制度的建議</h3>
<p>— 醒之</p>
<p>「敎靑營利化」，誰都痛恨。這種制度下被剝削的敎師史是痛恨它，甚至非營利的校長也痛恨着。然而有什慶辦法呢？政府遠離，市校解散，不開私校怎可維持敎育；而外人不分皂白地痛罵上海敎育營利化，怎叫眞正熱心敎育者不傷心呢？</p>
<p>然而，敎育營利化的學校到底是有，並且很多。在這種制度下：家長被欺騙，敎師被剝削，兒童被貽誤，速得我們非營利的敎育者也大受寃枉。因此，爲了敎育的前途，爲了市民的實利，爲了敎師的名譽，我們必須把學校營利制度推翻！</p>
<p>怎樣推翻之而另建合理的制度呢？釜底抽薪是最好的辦法。所以我們　從敎育營利化的成因加以觀察。</p>
<p>無疑的，因爲學校行政者，負了學校經濟盈虧的責仟，所以有營利的行爲。我們必先使學校行政者不必且不能負這種責任，那麼這營利制度自然會消減，並且行政者必將努力於教務，無所鄙吝。敎師待遇必可增高，兒童幸福必可獲得</p>
<p>那麼把學校的經濟責任交給誰呢？</p>
<p>鄙意：交給家長。或則有人說，我在說瘋話了，然而，不，我有理由：</p>
<p>（一）可以使敎師明白，自己是對家畏負資，不是對金錢負責，而格外的勤於敎學。</p>
<p>（二）可以使家長明白，敎師是自己請來代理自己辦理兒童敎育的專家，而改變家長輕視敎師的心理，增加家長對於學校的關心。</p>
<p>（三）與兒童程度有最密切利害關係的，乃是家長，而敎師的待遇和兒童的程度大有關係，叫家長們負責學校經濟，或可對敎師優待些吧！</p>
<p>（四）本來學校是社會分業後產生的，乃是家長敎育兒女時的代理人，所以經濟權歸家長，在理論上也是應該。</p>
<p>（五）祇要將經濟盈虧大權交給家畏就够了，由家長按照預算，按月撥發辦公費與校方，校方卽以此開支，在行政者可免開支不够之憂，在家長也並不煩瑣。</p>
<p>（六）祇要家長會議組織健全，校方和家長會，權能劃分得淸楚，規定家長不干涉學校行政，學校行政仍可統一。</p>
<p>（七）因爲家長會代表的是全部家長的利益，並非幾個家長的利益，所以對於兒童的處分，學校仍可從公執事。</p>
<p>（八）祇要家長會以全權委住校長，並予各敎師以適當任期，則教室必能無所顧忌、盡忠辦事、並且家長是流動的，較中最熟悉的人倒是教室，所以敎師們必知自己保障的有力，而樂於從事。</p>
<p>（九）譬如因物價飛漲而要增學費了，家長是預算的核准者，對於學校經濟可較明白，必能慷慨解囊，不致發生誤會。</p>
<p>（十）因爲出學費的是家長，現在經費公開給家長，則可避免敎育營利制度的汚名。</p>
<p>由於上述理由，我主張：</p>
<p>（一）由家長組織聯合會，產生理事，管理學校經濟，敎職員祇有呈提預算之權及使用辦公費之權。</p>
<p>（二）提高敎師待遇，家庭人口多者，更應予以津貼，並無故不得任意調換，而對於施敎方面，家長祇能貢獻原則，不可逞意批評干涉。</p>
<p>（三）家長會議，直接聘任校長，授予設施全權，任期一年二年四年或八年，敎職員由校長推薦，家長會議加聘，任期一年，以期行政統一。</p>
<p>（四）學費由家長會根據預算略加而決定，學期結束時，根據決算，提出部分準備費後，餘款發還。</p>
<p>（五）開辦費由各家長分担，後來之家長，每學期繳納基金若干元，當學生畢業或因事退出時，得收回基金或開辦費之一部或全部。</p>
<p>（六）學童已離校之家長，仍得列席家長會議。</p>
<p>這是我所擬的辦法的大槪。我以爲，這些營利學校老板的利潤，一方面是從家長處刮來，一方面是從敎師身上剝創來，所以如果能加以推翻而實行這新的制度，教帥和家長大概都可便宜些吧！</p>
<p>記得有一位朋友跟我說，他們小學校裹的校長，每年的利潤可以近萬。請你們想，假如拿這筆款子用於公的話，設備可添多少，敎薪可增多少，學費可减多少！</p>
<h3>不能同意</h3>
<p>— 林華英</p>
<p>讀了八月十七日本攔嚴正君的「妻的犧牲」，叉讀了二十六日陳銘君的「不是犧牲一，不禁手藩，熬不住要提起筆來寫幾句。</p>
<p>我覺得嚴正君的理想：「在婚後一同早出晚歸，各人盡各人對國家社會的責任」也就是一般人的理想。但是事實上却「輾轉在菜塲上，廚房裹，臥室中，變爲一個管家婦，」釀成「個巨大的犧牲。」我對於嚴正君的感慨，寄以極大的同情。</p>
<p>但是陳銘君「却不認爲犧牲」，認爲「料理家政，監視兒女也是一種事業」，而且以爲治家有方的主婦是本位救國。這似乎有一點像希特勒「婦女回到廚房里臥室里去」的派頭，怪不得陳銘君自己也承認：「我妻的態度，誠然不能代表全體婦女」了。</p>
<p>陳銘君認爲婦女到廚房臥室里去就是「理想的家庭」。事實上這樣「理想的家庭」恐怕不會多的吧！因爲大多數婦女正在對小菜塲－廚房－臥室的生活感覺單調無聊而並不像陳夫人般的「一絲沒有認爲是犧牲，也不懣怨」呢！</p>
<p>據陳銘君說，陳夫人本是一個大學生，擅長辯才，又富於組織力，常常在課外活動裏担仟重要的地位，」但是結婚養孩子之後，未曾參加任何團體，膽望前途，也決不會再參加社會活動了。以陳夫人這樣有才能的人物，竟不出來」領導社會」，却去培養小國民了。豈不可惜？如果中國二萬萬婦女，都爲了培養健全的小國民，而把領導社會的事業完全放棄了，那豈不是國家的力量减去了一半？這樣一來，等到二萬萬婦女培養出來的「小國民」成爲「國民」的時候，國家已亡，只好做做「健全的亡國奴」了。</p>
<p>固然，在目前婦女要完全脫離小菜塲－廚房－臥室的束縛，尚有待於社會的更趨完善，等到托兒所，公共食堂等社會事業發展的時候。但，陳銘君對有才能的領導人物陳夫人的完全放棄社會活動，却不認爲犧牲，就不能便人同意了。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第八章　捉住了兩個人</p>
<p>「你說他們本來是火一般熱，那末麗蘭爲什麼現在叉會拋棄他而另外交識姓趙的？」</p>
<p>那女子抬起目光向霍桑和我兩個人轉了一轉，便垂下了些，好像有些躊躇，又像有些害羞。「這個我不知道，我也說不出什麼。我也有些奇怪，那姓趙的我見過幾决，人品旣然不及小余，又不像有——」</p>
<p>「有什麼？」</p>
<p>「有——有——錢。」伊的頭更低沉了。</p>
<p>伊雖是道樣一個相當墮落的女子，竟也會有這種表示，不能不使我相信孟子所說：「羞惡之心人皆有之」的話，的確有着心理根據。</p>
<p>霍桑又道：「那末，麗蘭對於那姓趙的關係究竟到了怎樣的程度？你知道嗎？」</p>
<p>安娜搖頭道：「不知道。麗蘭對於這姓趙的從不曾跟我細談過。我祇知道他們的交識還是最近的事。」</p>
<p>霍桑頓了一頓，又突然問道：「你想這姓趙的會不會打死麗蘭？」</p>
<p>姜安娜怔了一怔，抬起頭來，驚異地問道：「他嗎？我不知道。我想他不會罷？因爲他們倆交識還不久，感情上當然還很熱；而且麗蘭和小余鬧翻，就爲的是他。他怎麼會打死伊？」</p>
<p>霍桑點頭道：「是的，這的確是一個矛盾。不過事實上他的嫌疑比小余更重。」</p>
<p>「奇怪，霍先生，你已見過這姓趙的嗎？」</p>
<p>「見過了。他還曾開槍打我。」</p>
<p>姜安娜又浮現出驚惶的神氣。「哎喲！我很抱歉，你沒有受傷嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑搖搖頭。「沒有，這個人現在捉住了。」</p>
<p>姜安娜道：「那好極。霍先生，我並沒有成見，祇要捉住了那個眞兇，給麗蘭伸寃，同時也讓我們當舞女的有一個保障就行。我疑心小余，也祇是我的猜想罷了。」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「那末，除了這兩個人以外，你想還有沒有其他可疑的人？」</p>
<p>姜安娜注視着地板，似在竭力思索，一時間又像沒有頭緒。（一二五）</p>
<h3>黑暗</h3>
<p>— 雷星</p>
<p>我們厭惡黑暗，但我們不懼怕黑暗；我們揭發黑暗，但我們不誇大黑暗。</p>
<p>是光明與黑暗搏鬥的年代呢。</p>
<p>透過漆黑，我們仍看見光彩；我們乃有了確信：黑暗必將過去，光明終將降臨。理想賜給了我們勇氣，毅力。</p>
<p>然而，也大有無力正視黑暗的人在。</p>
<p>比如說吧，眼前就有那麼一位某先生，他到了一次內地，看見政治上局部的貪汚現象，回到孤島，發表了一通議論；於是搖頭了。</p>
<p>但，多可憐的近視患者呵！</p>
<p>三年來我們的國家進步了那麼多，他竟看不見——是他無力正視光明嗎？却被過去官僚政治的殘餘駭昏了。自然，這是很嚴車的問題，然而得認淸牠的根源和必然的淸刷。</p>
<p>我們厭惡黑暗，但我們不懼怕黑暗；我們揭發黑暗，但我們不誇大黑暗。可是，我們要克服黑暗，黑暗必然將被克服！</p>

<h3>「中國」特派專員　攝製越南新聞影片</h3>
<p>— 稜白</p>
<p>當我們欣賞歐美各國出品的正片之前，往往同時能够看到非常珍貴的新聞片。新聞片的取材，是廣大地報道某地的新聞，過去祇是注重在娛樂一類，如今因爲國際風雲的緊急，更傾向於國際的宣傳。譬如日前大華放映「萬里征騎」前，共中一張有關倫敦防空的新聞片，非但迎合觀衆的趣味，而且可使觀衆增加防空方面的常識。</p>
<p>最近，越南的形勢非常緊張，那是有關我國抗戰的前送，所以極爲一般人士注意的。因此，中國電影製片廠，特派該廠軍事敎育片攝影師朱樹洪君，前往越南，在可能範圍中，攝取新聞片，眞的，那是一種流動的抗建敎育。</p>
<p>現在，朱樹洪君已以愼重而敏捷的姿態，將我方搶救越邊物資的情形攝取了許多鏡頭，並且已經寄到重慶總廠，廠方在冲洗剪輯下，認爲滿意，將於「中國」十月號電影新聞內放映，可惜我們在上海的同胞，暫時無法看到呀！</p>
<h3>紀「魂遊地府」三主角</h3>
<p>— 莎薇</p>
<p>「魂遊地府」（Earthbound）又是一部類似「人鬼世界」，「風流三昧」的影片，戲裏三個主角，在好萊塢的星羣中，也可算得是賣座的演員。第一個華納裝士德，他就是那「魂遊地府」的「寃鬼」，在電影界中已有十數年的歷史，以前是個和大明星的翰巴里摩亞等並駕齊驅的紅人，本片就是他東山再起的第一片，以他那剛毅果敢的作風，老練穩妥的演技，大概是不難把過去的榮譽恢復過來。</p>
<p>安德麗里絲，自從去年嫁了富商鮑勃之後，也曾息影家園，於最近才重作馮婦，加入福斯陣錢。如果她不上銀幕的話，也已是個很有聲望的女作家，當她在學校裏唸書的時候，對於文學已有着很深的修養。後來在某一决的遊藝會中，很倖運地，她的演技爲一個製片家所賞識，經過了銀幕試騐，就派她在「月缺難圓」中做愛德華亞諾的女兒，打好她踏上銀星寶座的根基。</p>
<p>科葩麗的芳名雖然沒有前兩個的響，她銀幕工作的開始，倒也相當早，不過那時在「飛燕驚鴻」中所演的角色不重要，不爲人所注意罷了，至於她怎麼會踏上銀幕，說起來實在是很偶然，而且也很有趣。林葩麗因爲希望自己將來成個明星，但又苦於沒有熟人介紹，所以就天天候在攝影塲的大鬥口等機會。有一天，大批明星剛從外面回攝影塲，林葩麗見機會難得，靈機一動，就雜在他們中間，溜了進去，那時正預備拍「飛燕驚鴻」，導演先生見這位陌小姐模樣生得很不錯，但不知爲何却在東撞西闖，問明了來意，就讓她在戲中客串一下，那裏知道，這一决的客串，眞會造成了她現在的地位。</p>
<p>裴士德和林葩麗在「魂遊地府」中，已不是第一决合作，以前他會合演過“The　Return　of　The　Cisco　Kid”，這决又加了個美麗的安德麗里絲，可見賣座影片商的眼光是有相當把握的。</p>
<h3>慶祝虞洽卿路命名紀念</h3>

<p>華聯銀聯保聯「三聯」於廿丸日上午十時假璇宮劇院第二週星期實騐公演，劇目計（一）紅燈籠（二）羅密歐與菜麗葉（三）小　兒，我的觀感如后：</p>
<p>紅燈籠－是我們熱稔而常見的劇本，里面最喫重的是石三爺這一角色，此次飾石三爺的是石厲，表演頗見成功，顯爲一戲劇人才，餘角平平。</p>
<p>羅密歐菜麗葉－這並不是莎翁手筆的「羅密歐與茱麗葉」的「鑄情」，而是叙述兩對以飾演羅密歐與茱麗葉的名伶的故事，一對是曾在過去的劇壇享過盛名的，可是現在已因爲「人老珠黃」而淪落了，另一對却正在大紅特紫的時候，然而爲了「職業上的妒忌」而時常吵嘴，但最後它們是和好了</p>
<p>演技當推飾羅勒的銘西爲最老練，語音沈着淸晰，女角沈瑛的利娜還不錯，不過就是台詞太快一點，叫人聽不請楚　餘如月明的潘婉兒，炎言、羅均稱職。</p>
<p>小妞兒——是江南打狼的故事，在對白上是足够叫人興奮的如「鬼子來了我們把它送上西天」！激昂慷慨引起了全塲鼓掌，最後當小妞兒和爺爺倆在眺望遠遠的大隊人馬時，小妞兒雀躍着說：「是咱們的，爺爺，那藍的像頭上的天，白的像太陽的允；紅的就像咱們的血，……」。全塲又是一片熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>演員如薇露的小妞兒，方白的老翁，魯愚的小獃子，都不差，可惜就是飾小妞兒的薇露的嗓音不愛聽，在特殊的尖銳帶些沙啞，餘角還好。</p>
<p>當我離開劇塲時，我在想念着：「三聯是有它光明的前途的！」</p>

<h3>US President Issues Proclamation: Expanding Scope of Embargo Against Japan, Restricting Export of Military Equipment and Supplies, Philippine Abaca Also Included</h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt yesterday further restricted the export of military supplies. The President's order stipulates that military searchlights, aerial cameras, and other military equipment and supplies are subject to export registration controls. At the same time, official personnel also stated that consideration is recently being given here to imposing an embargo on the Philippines to Japan. This measure may be decided by Congress or requested by the Federal Government to establish an export control method similar to that of the United States. The purpose of this plan is to intensify the US embargo on Japan in retaliation for Japan's alliance with the Axis powers. Defense experts here further stated that the export of abaca to Japan must be reconsidered. They claimed that the ban on the shipment of military supplies to Japan must include abaca from the Philippines. During a press conference, someone asked if a quantity of American steel was being smuggled from the Philippines to Japan. Secretary of State Hull replied that he had not previously paid attention to this matter. He also stated that he would be very willing to inquire about this at any time in the future. Hull also said that he had not heard of Japan purchasing scrap iron from Mexico to replace the supply it used to obtain from the United States. Hull refused to comment on the new Goldwater Bill proposed by government personnel. This bill relaxes restrictions on US loans to Britain, thereby allowing the United States to obtain naval and air force bases in the Pacific. The bill was submitted to Congress on Monday by its author, William Goldwater, a Democratic Senator from Utah. Hull stated that the Goldwater Bill has not yet been submitted to various government departments for comments, but he expressed his willingness to start soliciting comments from all parties on the bill within days. Currently, the government is unable to express its attitude towards the Goldwater Bill, but the bill will be debated in Congress this week. (2nd Associated Press)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt recently issued a proclamation that fire-fighting equipment, military searchlights, aerial cameras, etc., must be licensed before they can be exported. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington - Some isolationists here admit that it is only a matter of time before the United States enters the war. An observer told foreign reporters that if you are right, the United States will enter the war. The people clearly want to enter the war. There is no need to hide the facts. What we are preparing for now is war, not peace. The sooner we abandon the illusion of arming ourselves based on peace and actively make war efforts, the more beneficial it will be to us. German sources with inside information openly stated to Americans that there are three reasons for Germany's signing of the Tripartite Pact: (1) The realization that the European war will be a long-term war; (2) The trend for President Roosevelt to be re-elected; (3) The hope that Japan's joining the Axis powers will keep the United States out of the war. According to diplomatic circles, the bait used by Germany to lure Japan into signing the Tripartite Pact was to allow Japan to seize and retain the land east of India. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>London - The Swedish capital's Social Democratic newspaper stated that Germany and Italy's declaration of war against the United States in the current situation of aerial and naval warfare will not help Japan. However, the United States' joining the war on the British side, and Japan's subsequent declaration of war against the United States, will be a crisis for Japan. What Japan is currently anxious about is the transfer of British naval bases in East Asia to the United States and the increasingly severe sanctions against Japan by Washington. However, this anxiety cannot be reduced by the Berlin Treaty. If one of the purposes of the new alliance is to deter the United States with the threat of a two-pronged attack, preventing it from actively participating in the European or Far Eastern wars, then the union of the European and Asian "new order" processes will only make the United States realize the utter senselessness of continuing its isolationist policy. If so, the German-Italian-Japanese alliance will have an effect that was not anticipated, making Britain and the United States more united in their joint struggle and defense. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>New York - Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi told a Washington correspondent of the New York Japanese Daily today that the opportunity for well-intentioned people to prevent a direct conflict between Japan and the United States has not yet passed. The first step to understanding is for Foreign Minister Matsuoka and US Ambassador to Japan Grew to hold informal talks. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, when asked by reporters about his views on the US-Japan Joint Conference proposed by Howard, the leader of the US Howard newspaper group, aimed at improving US-Japan relations, replied that this idea is indeed interesting, but whether it is practical or timely is questionable. He also stated that the idea of this committee must be implemented only if the group can recognize the "New Order in East Asia." He also stated that the committee is studying facts based on pre-war concepts, which may not be practical. Rather than having this committee, it would be better to let things take their natural course. If the US government could send a delegation to Japan and listen to Japan's views, then this committee might help improve US-Japan relations. The Japanese government has not abandoned the improvement of US-Japan relations, but any American attempt to reach this understanding must be based on recognition of Japan's "New Order in East Asia" and the elimination of the old international structure.

<p>Tokyo - President Mitsunaga of the Japan Newspaper Federation recently telegraphed US newspaper tycoon Howard, asking him to guide the American public in order to maintain peace in the Pacific. The telegram stated that the crisis in the Pacific is more severe than ever before. If the United States abandons its fortifications in Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Midway Island, abandons its policy of assisting General Chiang Kai-shek, and restores normal US-Japan trade, then this danger can be avoided. Otherwise, in the near future, the United States and Japan will inevitably have an armed conflict. (2nd Associated Press)</p>

<h3>Britain Will Provide Active Assistance to China with Allied Treatment: Open Burma Road, Lend Massive Funds to China, Plan to Cut Off Japan's War Materials</h3>
<p>London - Due to the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, it is heard that Britain's Far East policy has tended towards opening the Burma Road and treating China as an ally. It is heard that the British government has been considering several measures to actively assist China after or simultaneously with the announcement of the reopening of the Burma Road. It is heard that these plans include allowing a loan of £500,000 or £1 million to Chongqing and sending a central military mission to Chongqing. It is heard that the military mission will be led by a prominent military figure. (2nd Associated Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today warned Britain that if Britain reopens the Burma Road to transport war materials to aid the Chongqing government, Japan will act according to its own ideas. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that when the current Anglo-Japanese agreement expires on October 18, Japan will not request the British to block the Burma Road, but if Britain opens it, Japan will retaliate. In short, Japan will build East Asia according to its established plan, removing all obstacles. The newspaper speculated that due to British and American cooperation in the Pacific, Britain will open this road when the Anglo-Japanese agreement expires. At the same time, according to the Asahi Shimbun, the world's attention is now focused on the plans of Britain and the United States to deal with Japan and the Rome-Berlin Axis alliance. The British and its autonomous governments are holding meetings to plan the cutting off of Japan's war materials. However, the only aspects of Japanese imports affected are iron, zinc, and rubber from Malaya and copper from Canada. Therefore, Japan has nothing to fear in this regard. (2nd Associated Press)</p>
<h3>US Both Parties Advocate: Maintaining Status Quo in Far East, Both Sides Publicly Express Willingness to Cooperate, Urge Government to Take Firm Stance</h3>
<p>Washington - Spokespersons for the US Republican and Democratic parties both issued statements last night urging the United States to take a firm stance in the Far East. With both parties publicly expressing their willingness to cooperate with each other, spokespersons for both parties refused to accept the suggestion that the United States withdraw from its Far East policy. Republican leader Wendell Willkie of New York declared in the House of Representatives that the United States must adhere to its status quo in the Far East. He stated that he even agreed that the Philippines should continue to be protected by the United States. If the Philippine Legislative Assembly makes this request to Washington, the United States should accept it, but this move must be initiated entirely by the Philippines. He stated that Japan may misunderstand the United States' motive for granting freedom to the Philippines, thinking that this move is a sign of American weakness. He also stated that the United States had allowed the Philippines to restore its freedom before Japan's invasion of Vietnam and the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Democratic spokesman in the Foreign Affairs Department, Senator Halines of Missouri, also stated that the United States should "maintain its position in the Far East." He stated, "We must intensify our aid to Britain as our response to Japan's joining the Axis alliance. The situation in the Far East a month ago is no longer determined by the Far East, but must be determined by the Atlantic." Halines had supported the US withdrawal from its Far Eastern interests several years ago, but he believed that this should not be done now. He stated that the Japanese side might misunderstand this as American weakness, leading to further incidents. Furthermore, Congress discussed the possibility of the US and the Soviet Union seeking rapprochement to deal with the Far Eastern situation, but most members agreed that this matter had no realistic political basis in the United States, although it was a good opportunity from a diplomatic point of view. Sources with inside information believe that an agreement between the US and the Soviet Union would be of little benefit to the United States, because the United States is not currently in a very good position to begin negotiations with Moscow. (2nd Associated Press)</p>
<p>Washington - Republican Congressman Fish of New York formally issued a statement yesterday, saying that US Far East policy is now "full of explosives." He stated, "Any provocative action may ignite the flames of war. President Roosevelt's empty threats in his Far East policy have driven Japan into the arms of Germany and Italy. The dictatorial New Deal is so chaotic and uneasy that it will inevitably move towards the path of war." He also stated that President Roosevelt must not engage in any military or naval alliances or other war steps with other countries without congressional approval. He stated, "Otherwise, I dare to predict that he will fight in the Far East with a high-handed attitude." (2nd Associated Press)</p>
<h3>US Rapidly Manufactures: Airplanes and Submarines, Defend Western Hemisphere Coast</h3>
<p>Washington - Naval circles stated today that the United States' expansion of its submarine fleet and maritime aircraft strength is a major factor in defending the Western Hemisphere from attack. It is said that although the US fleet has achieved balanced strength today, if the submarine tonnage is increased and the maritime aircraft strength is augmented, then various problems encountered in US defense can be more appropriately addressed. The Western Hemisphere coastline is very long and requires a large number of ships to patrol in order to report any alerts immediately. Submarines and maritime aircraft are best suited for this task, so the US is manufacturing these two types of equipment particularly rapidly. (2nd Associated Press)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union and Japan in the New Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>After the announcement of the Tripartite Pact, the world's attention has been unexpectedly focused on the Soviet Union, which spans Europe and Asia and has been granted special reservations in the terms of the pact. What kind of actions will it take in the increasingly critical Pacific situation? The Zhenli Bao's editorial on the 30th has already semi-officially stated the Soviet Union's views on the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact and its continued adherence to its neutral and peaceful policy, but the neutral and peaceful policy cannot restrict its steps to engage in active self-defense, as evidenced by the various events that Eastern Europe has undergone in the past year. Therefore, while it is not close to the facts to speculate that the Soviet Union will join forces with Britain and the United States against Japan, it is even more inappropriate to view the Soviet Union as too passive or even maliciously accuse it of colluding with the three countries. So, under its deep and unwavering consistent line, what exactly will its specific actions be? This is precisely what the safety of half of the Far East depends on in the future.</p>
<p>The actual effectiveness of Japan's Tripartite Pact, apart from spiritual self-comfort, is a big question, but in terms of its relationship with the Soviet Union, it is a loss. Article 4 of the Tripartite Pact stipulates that it does not affect the current relations between the signatory countries and the Soviet Union. That only has a negative meaning, but it can never eliminate the shadow between this alliance and the Soviet Union or make the relations between the three countries and the Soviet Union more advanced. In Japan, there is only an attitude of improving relations with the Soviet Union so far. Its long delay in taking any action suggests that there is considerable resistance to this move within Japan. Moreover, not only has a concrete principle of mutual understanding and approach between the two countries not yet been established, but even the accumulated long-standing outstanding issues have not yet been cleared up. Therefore, the phrase "does not affect relations with the Soviet Union" has great significance only in Germany. It is of little value to Japan. If it is said that after the three countries privately divided Europe and Asia, the Soviet Union, which is in the crevice of the European and Asian "new order", will be humbly respectful and smoothly complete the negotiation of the non-aggression agreement with Japan, that is always difficult to imagine. Japanese right-wing elements have recently paid great attention to relations with the Soviet Union and regarded the realization of friendly relations with the Soviet Union as a prerequisite for implementing the southward advance. At present, there is no progress in Soviet-Japanese diplomacy, and Japan has placed itself in the middle of unprecedented major adventures. This is due to the embarrassment and greed that forced it to wait. On the other hand, it is also sufficient to prove that the Tripartite Pact is mainly based on the interests of the German side. Under the conditions that the hungry are easy to feed, Japan has no possibility of advancing and choosing a time more favorable to its own side.</p>
<p>However, although the Tripartite Pact has not improved Japan's difficulties, it has created the relative isolation of the Soviet Union. The obviousness of the current international division is almost restored to the situation before the Munich Agreement. Only the Soviet Union still has no support and is alone outside the two opposing fronts of democratic countries and Axis countries. For the Soviet Union, this may be the most convenient position to cope with the current war crisis, but whether the increasingly acute confrontation of the international front can allow this absolute neutral attitude to continue to be maintained is a major question. Recently, both major powers have launched diplomatic wars against the Soviet Union, each trying to pull the Soviet Union from neutrality to its own camp. Even if the Soviet Union itself never takes sides, its every move will inevitably have a subtle impact on the advances and retreats of both major powers. Strictly speaking, peace is indivisible, and neutrality cannot exist apart from reality. The Soviet authorities should understand this point better than anyone else. Therefore, people in the world do not have to haggle over the meaning of words, but should pay close attention to its actual trends.</p>
<p>The Zhenli Bao's editorial first pointed out that the relationship between Germany, Italy, and Japan has long existed, but that is precisely aimed at the Soviet Union's anti-communist purpose. At present, the target of the three countries' opposition is clearly not the Soviet Union, but the United States, Britain, and some small and weak nations, but since the anti-communist purpose has not been announced and cancelled, and the internal basis of the anti-communist purpose has not been completely eliminated in the three countries, then the contradiction between the Soviet Union and the Axis countries is now eased, and in the final plan of the Axis countries to divide the world, how it will place the Soviet Union is an interesting question. Of course, regardless of the outcome of the future war, whether the participating parties win or lose, it will be equal to both sides suffering losses. Even the victors will not have the strength to threaten the Soviet Union at that time. However, this cruel idea of treating everything as expendable should not be the original intention of the Soviet Union's neutral and peaceful policy.</p>
<p>At present, the world war situation is still expanding, and the various separated wars also have a tendency to gradually connect with each other, but the nature of the individual cases cannot be summarized by the phrase "the expansion of imperialist war." No matter how the world war develops, China's heroic resistance and the wars caused by opposing the invasion of China and other small and weak nations will not obscure the special significance of its own great glory, and even be classified into the category of imperialist war. There is no doubt about the Soviet Union's fundamental position on this point, and even Germany does not believe that the Soviet Union's military assistance to China is in conflict with the Tripartite Pact. The Soviet Union will not weaken its support for China's resistance because of this. However, for the sake of the thorough security of the Soviet Union's own eastern border, for the sake of clarifying the Pacific situation, and for the sake of not failing the expectations of anti-aggression elements all over the world, the Soviet Union deserves full consideration for any suggestions regarding curbing the atrocities of aggression in the Far East, and should not avoid them for fear of being suspected of participating in the imperialist war.</p>
<p>In short, the Far Eastern situation has come to the eve of a new war due to the Tripartite Pact, and no country along the Pacific coast can absolutely stay out of it. Regarding the future of the Far East, in addition to China's resistance and British and American cooperation, the Soviet Union is the most decisive factor. At present, Japan's desire to advance southward has expanded to its peak, but there is a major weakness in its relations with the Soviet Union. This is also the focus of the struggle between the aggressors and anti-aggressors in the Far East. In addition to maintaining its consistent position, the Soviet Union is also expected to take a positive attitude and measures in response to the current situation.</p>

<h3>National Government Order: Honoring Feng Anbang</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Government issued an order on the 2nd stating that Lieutenant General Feng Anbang, Commander of the 42nd Army, was well-versed in military strategy, actively engaged in military service, and always took the lead in battles, earning a distinguished military reputation. Since the War of Resistance, he has repeatedly established special merits in Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong provinces, and has been promoted to a specialized position.

<h3>Zhou Zhongyue Has Not Resigned</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A reporter recently met with Zhou Zhongyue, Minister of the Interior, and inquired about his thoughts on the recent fabrication of rumors by the Japanese side. Zhou smiled and said, "Previously, it was rumored that I had flown back to Kunming and that Yunnan would take action. Recently, they falsely claimed that I suddenly submitted my resignation due to differences of opinion with the Central Government. In fact, I have been in Chongqing day and night, and have never returned to Yunnan, nor have I resigned. During this period of resistance, I will do my utmost to serve the country, and I will never lightly consider retiring until the situation is clear and the national territory is restored. Chairman Long is loyal, patriotic, and obedient to the leader, and has never changed his stance. It is even more inconsistent with the facts to say that Chairman Long's views differ from those of the Central Government. This kind of provocation and sowing of discord has long been seen through by the people of the whole country and is not enough to confuse public opinion." (1st Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Will Adopt a Policy of Benevolent Neutrality Towards the Axis Powers; It Is Widely Rumored That the German Foreign Minister Will Visit Moscow in an Attempt to Facilitate a Non-Aggression Pact Between Japan and the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Berlin: International News Agency received information from authoritative sources last night that the Soviet Union will assume the role of "sympathetic observer" in the theater of the Axis powers. It is said that the Soviet Union will not participate in the military activities of the German-Italian-Japanese Axis and will instead adopt a policy of benevolent neutrality. However, it is also learned from reliable sources that the Soviet Union may sign a non-aggression pact with Japan, and that Germany and Italy will indeed facilitate this. Informed circles in Berlin do not believe that the Soviet Union will sign an open military agreement with the Axis powers, but observers firmly believe that the Soviet Union will continue to sympathize with the Axis powers. Some influential figures predict that Stalin's position may allow him to "retaliate against the United States for its interference in Soviet affairs and to retaliate against the United States' meddling during the Soviet-Finnish conflict." As for the Soviet Union's immediate participation in the Axis, it is rumored that the German Foreign Minister will soon visit Moscow to hold important talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. The German Foreign Ministry has neither confirmed nor denied this rumor, so this speculation has become widespread. (2nd Dispatch, International)</p>
<p>London: Berlin has neither admitted nor denied the rumor that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop has gone to Moscow. However, German radio reported that when Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Spanish Foreign Minister Suner left Berlin, the German Foreign Minister was unable to see them off because he had already left for another destination. According to some opinions, Germany intends to create this mystery to create the speculation that the German Foreign Minister has gone to Moscow. Germany cannot help but worry about the reaction of the Soviet Union after the signing of the German-Italian-Japanese Axis pact. It is also conceivable that Ribbentrop will fly to Moscow to dispel Soviet doubts and reach an agreement with the Soviet government. It would be beneficial for Germany if Germany could induce Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to come to Berlin in person. However, Molotov will certainly not fall into their trap, and Germany is prepared to condescend to seek instruction. (2nd Dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Soviet Spokesman Denies Soviet-Japanese Understanding at the Expense of China - Relations Between Britain and the Soviet Union Are Unlikely to Improve</h3>
<p>London: It was generally expected here that Japan's joining the Axis would make the Soviet Union more friendly towards Britain, but the situation has turned out to be the opposite. The Soviet Union's actions seem to be leaning towards Japan, and the already cold relations between Britain and the Soviet Union will become even worse. However, a Soviet spokesman recently told a reporter from the United Press that the rumor that the Soviet Union would sacrifice China to reach an understanding with Japan is absolutely not true. He also said that Moscow does not covet Japan's recognition of Soviet leadership in Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang. Regarding Japan's southward advance, the spokesman said that if the British Navy used it, it would be enough to limit Japan's ambitions. The spokesman said that if the United States extended its naval base from Hawaii to Singapore, Japan's ambitions towards the Dutch East Indies, Borneo, and other Pacific regions would be curbed, and he believed that the presence of major US warships in Singapore would frighten the Japanese and even deter them from invading Hong Kong. Furthermore, diplomatic circles here say that unless the United States rises to remedy the defects in Anglo-Soviet relations, Anglo-Soviet relations are unlikely to improve. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, without waiting for instructions from his government, has already told British Foreign Secretary Halifax that the British proposal is unacceptable.

<h3>Japan Is Eager to Approach the Soviet Union; Tatekawa Goes to Moscow to Take Office and Immediately Begins Diplomatic Activities</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma recently told foreign reporters that if the Soviet Union wishes to conclude a non-aggression pact with Japan, the Japanese government will consider negotiating with it. Suma declined to comment on reports that Germany and Italy were encouraging the Soviet Union to conclude such a treaty. He also said that Lieutenant General Tatekawa, the new Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union, who is about to leave for the Soviet Union, is a plenipotentiary representative with the authority to engage in all negotiations. (2nd Dispatch, United Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today continued to demand closer ties between Japan and the Soviet Union to remove the shackles on Japan's southward advance policy. The Yomiuri Shimbun and Hochi Shimbun both expressed the hope that the recent establishment of an alliance between Japan and the Axis powers could lead to closer ties between Japan and the Soviet Union. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that "the Japanese government should disregard past difficulties and take the necessary steps in accordance with this policy. The reason for the urgency of these measures is that the current diplomatic process of the United States towards the Soviet Union aims to undermine the possibility of closer ties between Japan and the Soviet Union." Asahi Shimbun and Hochi Shimbun stated that the Soviet Union should stop its aid to the Chinese government in order to eliminate obstacles between Japan and the Soviet Union.

<h3>Assisting Britain and Aiding China is the United States' Policy; American Newspapers Write Articles Criticizing the Tripartite Alliance</h3>
<p>New York: American newspapers yesterday explained that the German-Italian-Japanese military alliance will hardly hinder the United States from assisting Britain and China. The New York Times stated that the main purpose of this agreement is to deal with the United States. However, the American people have recognized that Britain's victory is important and understand that these three countries, which have become enemies of the American way of life, not only want to divide Europe, Asia, and Africa, but also want to incite Latin America to make their omnipotent power penetrate the New World. This kind of agreement is harmful to us. However, if the United States recognizes the path it is following, its harm can be reduced or eliminated. Increasing aid to Britain and China should be regarded as an essential element in the Western Hemisphere's self-defense policy. The New York World-Telegram stated that the United States currently has no reason to attack any of these three countries that are preparing for an American attack. However, if these three countries combine many wars into one war and directly unite to attack the United States, then the interests of assisting Britain, maintaining order in the Far East, guaranteeing the security of the Americas, and other goals of our defense policy will be threatened. If we face this kind of direct threat, we will naturally deal with it with all the means at our disposal. Japan should not expect us to continue supplying it with munitions as before, and Germany should not expect us to reduce aid to Britain. It should be known that the steps we take are taken after careful consideration. The Chicago Daily News said, "Our assistance to Britain and China is in accordance with the national policy jointly supported by Roosevelt and Willkie. We will continue to assist Britain and China. We have just begun to partially block Japan's military purchases, and we will impose a complete embargo at any necessary time." (2nd Dispatch, United Press)</p>

<h3>European War Miscellany (10) (6) Daily Bombings: Anecdotes of British and German Civilians</h3>
<p>In modern warfare, the activities of the air force occupy a very important position. In this European war, the British and German sides bombed each other, back and forth, almost as a daily routine. Both sides keep the real military losses secret. However, judging from the situation in all aspects, the British and German people do not seem to have succumbed under such large-scale air raids, and have shown an attitude of persisting to the end. The following is a translation of the New York Times' account of the actions of the British and German people under the great bombings:</p>
<p>The scope of German air force activities in Britain, in addition to the "heart" of Britain and the ports, is the capital, London. The targets of the bombing are always aircraft fields, factories, oil depots, bridges, and railways. When attacking London, the German aircraft always come from the east. In an instant, strange screams and bombing sounds mix together. Because the German side, in order to intimidate the British, often attaches a strange-sounding whistle to the back of the bomb. Before it explodes, it makes a strange cry, which is heartbreaking. The British "Spitfire" and "Hurricane" aircraft immediately take off to meet the enemy. The sound of machine guns can be faintly heard at an altitude of tens of thousands of feet. The ground anti-aircraft guns fired hundreds of rounds per minute. As a result, the sound of houses collapsing, the cries of women and children, and the sound of aircraft engines mingled together. Under such continuous German air raids, will the morale of the British people be shaken? Judging from the facts, that may not be the case. Women in the countryside are very calm about the bombing. When they are awakened by the sound of bombs nearby at night, they soon hear the maids gently knocking on the door and saying in a calm tone, "Madam, please listen to the sound of the bombs." Children are as calm as adults. One day, a six-year-old child was playing in a garden outside London when suddenly a long, drawn-out scream was heard in the air, followed by a roar, which was a sign that a German bomb was about to come. The child happily said to the adults, "That must be a bomb."</p>
<p>What kind of situation do the British face under German air raids? It depends on the different environment and time when the air raid occurs. Before the air raid siren sounds, German planes are often already appearing in the clouds. Therefore, citizens sometimes use the sound of enemy bombs or the sight of aerial combat as the only air raid warning. At first, when the citizens of London encountered the alarm, they hurriedly ran to the air raid shelters, and the streets were emptied of pedestrians, and buses and other vehicles were completely stopped. Except for the police and ambulance teams, nothing else could be seen. The whole city seemed to be suffering from acute paralysis, and everything seemed to be dead. Now, the situation is somewhat different. Citizens are already accustomed to German air raids. After hearing the alarm, only a few people run into the air raid shelters, and the police and guards have to ask them to "enter the cave." The people on the road have an attitude of not moving until the last minute. Over time, everyone still works as usual when they hear the alarm, and only start to hide when they see the enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Not moving around without seeing the enemy aircraft has become a firm and unwavering policy. When the various ordnance factories hear the air raid alarm, they turn on the searchlights, and the workers continue to work as usual. If the searchlight shines on an enemy aircraft flying directly towards the factory, then the emergency alarm will sound without a second decision, and everyone will walk into the air raid shelter step by step.</p>
<p>The staff of major stores and banks in the city of London often hear the alarm and go to the air raid shelter, but nothing happens. After a few times, they feel it is too troublesome, and everyone is too lazy to move around, and still sit and work quietly in the sound of the alarm. Although the business authorities oppose this method, what can be done when habit becomes nature? Therefore, even though German planes are flying over the city of London, the public is no longer completely "hiding."</p>
<p>Many munitions factory workers in the "heart" of Britain are also unusually calm. There is a worker who specializes in steelmaking and is very stubborn by nature. When enemy planes come to attack, others hide in the air raid shelters, but he always stays still and continues to work. He uses a lamp with very weak light to illuminate, and everything is unaffected. Once, not long after the air raid alarm, everyone else had run away, and only he was left in the factory guarding the solitary lamp and working. In an instant, a German incendiary bomb fell through the roof. When the firefighters arrived to put out the fire, he said indifferently, "Friends, please put out the fire, but don't put out my little lamp, it's the only light I have!"</p>
<p>There is a hotel in the suburbs of London. One day, a group of journalists came during an air raid alarm. They had just returned from the front line and were preparing to have a snack in the hotel. The hotel owner said to them, "Gentlemen, you can either eat or go to the basement, as you please. I have told the servants here to go to the air raid shelter, but they insist on staying to serve you." From this, we can see even more the calm attitude of the British towards German air raids.</p>
<p>Even in the air raid shelters, everyone is very calm and does not look frightened at all. Sometimes, when there are fewer people, you can see two people playing chess in the corner of the wall. The ladies are either reading books or doing needlework, very quietly. Those who like to smoke can also smoke in the suite. Female typists and stenographers often sing a song slowly, and everyone joins in and sings, full of interest.</p>
<p>There is also a kind of person who is calm in name, but actually shows a stubborn "foolish bravery." They often stand on the street, regardless of everything, and watch the planes fighting in the sky for fun when enemy planes are already flying overhead. If they are not careful, they will die if a bullet flies over. These people are responsible for their own deaths and injuries, but they also involve the ambulance team in doing rescue work, which indirectly creates more trouble. Therefore, the authorities prohibit people from watching the fun in the sky, and anyone who does not have a steel helmet is not allowed to stand on the street.</p>
<p>This kind of so-called "watching the fun" is not only the case in cities, but also in the countryside. Some people who like to do outdoor activities or play ball often continue to play even when air battles are taking place. In a golf course outside London, there were many people playing there when suddenly machine guns started firing from planes in the sky, followed by the sound of bombs exploding. They were having fun and didn't care. It was not until a British "Hurricane" plane landed in the field that this group of people gave up their fun.</p>
<p>After a bombing in the city, a strange scene often appears. You can see several houses on the street, the front of which has been bombed, while the back half is still well preserved, and the furnishings in the house are clear at a glance. It is like a toy house. The strangest thing is that sometimes mirrors and porcelain are still intact. A set of clothes in front of the bed is also folded very well, and has not changed its shape. This is because the front half of the house is sucked away by the vacuum power of the bomb, while the inside is only slightly affected.</p>
<p>People who live in the countryside often encounter very strange things. There is a family living in a town who has a nephew serving in the air force. One day, this nephew came down in a parachute in the air and asked people on the village road, "Where is this?" After they explained it to him, he said, "Great, I have an uncle here." So this boy, who was separated by several miles, descended from the sky and unexpectedly went to his uncle's house to rest for a while.</p>
<p>One day, a lady was peeling beans in the kitchen, preparing to cook a meal. Suddenly, a German airman who had been forced to land from a bomber came to the door, and she grabbed him. The British treat captured German soldiers in a decent manner. The most needed things for German soldiers are beer and cigarettes. If there is a bar nearby, then they will of course get beer first. The people who catch the German soldiers also toast with their prisoners.</p>
<p>Although there are many deaths and injuries in the cities under air raids, the morale of the British people is very strong. The bombed shops hang a wooden board at the doorway with the words "Business as usual." Women often say to people, "Yes, our house has been bombed, but don't worry about anything, what does it matter?" Immediately after the air raid, people come out to raise funds to help the bombed refugees.</p>
<p>Why are the British so calm? There is also a reason for this. In addition to the strong and unyielding personality of the British people, they have great confidence in the strength of their air force. When they hear the news of how many German planes have been shot down by their air force, they are all very excited. They feel that hiding in the air raid shelter and "waiting to die" is a sign of cowardice. They are united in their hatred of the enemy and must retaliate. Moreover, the common people are all proud to be able to take risks with the air force soldiers.</p>
<p>As for the attacks by the British Air Force on various parts of Germany, the British claim that their losses are "very heavy"; while the Germans often respond with "the British are completely fabricating rumors." British aircraft used sixty heavy bombers to attack Hamburg. The British aircraft were already familiar with the important military centers there, such as munitions factories, aircraft fields, warehouses, bridges, railways, and ports. Under "unloading-style" bombing, how could they not hit any of them? The difference between the British and German armies is that the British Air Force mainly uses dispersed bombing, while the Germans focus on concentrated bombing.</p>
<p>British aircraft bombing Germany often causes Germans to feel very painful. Once, British aircraft attacked Babelsberg, a suburb of Berlin. Although there were not many deaths and injuries, a bomb hit the telephone exchange, so everyone was out of touch for several days. Of all of Germany, the southwest region suffered the most bombings by British troops, followed by the north. The British Air Force went to bomb in shifts, causing the Germans to be constantly harassed. The headquarters simply issued a notice saying, "In the future, if only one enemy aircraft comes to attack, the air raid alarm will no longer be issued, so as to avoid disturbing the citizens in the industrial center."</p>
<p>From May 17 to July 8, Hamburg was attacked by British aircraft 28 times. Many times it was three times a day, and the losses were said to be not small. However, according to the German side, only one out of ten British aircraft can break through the fire net, so there are no major losses. The residents of the Ruhr area suffered the most harassment from British aircraft, and hardly had a good night's sleep. The air raids in the middle of the night and early morning were the most unbearable. From 2:00 a.m. to 4:00 a.m., everyone would get up from bed and quickly hide in the air raid shelter when they heard the alarm. Over time, it became a habit, and almost at this time, they would automatically report to the air raid shelter.</p>
<p>In early September, Berlin was subjected to continuous air raids by British aircraft. At the worst, citizens had to sleep in the air raid shelter for twelve hours. Because of carelessness or accidentally catching a cold, many people suffered from the flu. A pharmacy in the center of Berlin sold out all cough lozenges and cold medicine in a week of British air raids. In order to prevent catching a cold, the citizens of Berlin later put on coats when they heard the air raid alarm, and then walked into the air raid shelter.</p>
<p>The air raid shelters in the Ruhr area are equipped with all kinds of furniture, and even beds for children are arranged in this basement. As soon as it gets dark, they take their children into the shelter to spend the night until the next morning. The calmness of the Germans in the western region is also quite admirable. A couple was about to celebrate their silver wedding anniversary. In view of the difficult situation, they did not want to hold a celebration. One day, when the air raid alarm sounded loudly, the couple walked into the air raid shelter and saw that a celebration scene had been prepared for them inside. It turned out that a few neighbors in their apartment knew that the air raid alarm came on time and had been tested repeatedly, so they held a celebration in the air raid shelter, and everyone enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<p>In an air raid shelter in Charlottenburg, West Berlin, on the night of September 25, a 21-year-old young woman gave birth to a child inside. Fortunately, a female nurse trained by the Red Cross knew how to deliver a baby, so both mother and child were safe. This is a novel event in the air raid shelter.

<h3>British Air Force Shows Its Power in Germany; Fiercely Attacks Berlin, Dropping Bombs Like Rain; Destroys Power Stations and Disrupts Railway Traffic; American Pilots Lead Team to Assist British in Battle for the First Time</h3>
<p>From the night before last to yesterday morning, British aircraft fiercely attacked Berlin for three and a half hours, dropping large and small bombs as dense as raindrops. At the same time, other British bombers were active in various parts of Germany. The Air Headquarters' Intelligence Office stated that when British aircraft attacked Berlin, they used the firelight to identify the western power station that had been heavily damaged in the previous attack. After the first batch of bombs were dropped, there was a violent explosion, followed by fires in many places. The Klingenberg power station was also bombed, and railways and factories were set on fire. The British heavy bombers took off from 10:30 p.m. and flew over Berlin until 2:00 a.m. before returning. The British aircraft active in other parts of Germany attacked the railway yard in Mannheim. Huge bombs exploded continuously with great force. The firelight flickered, and it was thought that a pile of ammunition had been hit and exploded. Also, high-explosive bombs were dropped on the oil refineries and railway yards in Hanover and Runa (north of Leipzig), hitting their targets. The sound of explosions was endless, and the aircraft caught fire. Another batch of bombs also hit and caught fire. The two fires merged, and another explosion occurred. The aircraft's fuselage was hit, and six fires broke out. The sound of explosions gradually subsided only after the British aircraft dropped the last batch of bombs. The pilots of the British aircraft that bombed the railway yard in Mannheim believed that many ammunition trains had been destroyed because of the continuous explosions of huge bombs. The port of Mannheim was also bombed, and the fire was so bright that it illuminated the sky. British aircraft also attacked the railway yards near the ports of Ostend and Brussels, which also caught fire. A British bomber shot down a German aircraft on its way back after the attack. Also, British coastal aircraft and naval aircraft attacked the shipyards and oil storage depots in Rotterdam, the shipyards and cargo docks in Ostend, and the piles of aircraft in the Hansted airfield, hitting their targets and causing fires. Five British aircraft went missing. Also, two British Air Force bombers flew out on a reconnaissance mission in the morning and shot down two German Dornier Do 18 bombers, both of which crashed into the sea. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin Last night, British aircraft attempted to attack Berlin, but were repelled by the national defense forces. Only a few dropped a few bombs in the suburbs of Berlin, which did not hit military targets. (2nd Huitong)</p>

<h3>The Full Picture of German Espionage and Plainclothes Activities</h3>
<p>American Naval Intelligence Colonel Donavan and journalist Mueller, under the orders of U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox, investigated German espionage activities in Europe. Upon their return, they submitted a voluminous report of tens of thousands of words. Among other things, it details the organization, scope of activities, and effectiveness of the German plainclothes unit (i.e., the so-called Fifth Column). We now present a summary based on the full text released by Knox, as follows:</p>
<p>What is the key to the effectiveness of German espionage and plainclothes units? We can find the answer in Hitler's own words. He once said, "We certainly need an army, but not in the way it was used during the Great War of 1914. In the future, the function of artillery can be replaced by propaganda, which will be greatly reformed. Before the army starts fighting, we must first psychologically demoralize the enemy, so that they want to surrender without even engaging in battle... Our weapon is to make the enemy mentally confused, indecisive, and panic-stricken. The history of revolutions around the world... is all the same: the ruling class always surrenders first. Why? Because the psychology of defeat has long been at work, and they are at a loss."</p>
<p>"Money makes the world go round." The German espionage and plainclothes organizations spend a massive $200 million annually to "drive" all their secret operations. Its organization is centered on the Nazi Party and uses an "overseas organization division" as a tool. This division has as many as four million "comrades" stationed in foreign countries, all of whom are capable and talented individuals. There are 600 local branches in 45 countries around the world. The headquarters is located in Stuttgart, Germany, and a director in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs named Baume directs all affairs. He has approximately 800 subordinates and assistants. The names of the overseas local branches are not uniform and vary according to the local environment. In short, the phrase "inventing titles and disguising well" encompasses everything. Among the four million people engaged in espionage and plainclothes work, there are genuine Germans, "neutralized" Germans, and even non-Germans. The so-called "neutralized" Germans are those who reside in foreign countries and can obtain the nationality of their host country, whether it be American or Portuguese, but their original German nationality can still be retained. These are the people who can cooperate internally and externally in secret when something happens. Children born abroad fifty years ago are still recognized by the Berlin government as German citizens. Anyone who can "pledge allegiance" to Germany, even if they are not German, is regarded as a treasure by the Nazi Party, which searches for and recruits them everywhere, with a great sense of "eagerly seeking talent." Foreigners whom the Germans regard as "of the same blood," such as Scandinavians, Dutch, Flemings, German-speaking Swiss, and even Anglo-Saxons, are treated even more like brothers and sisters, and are relied upon even more.</p>
<p>Within the vast furnace of German espionage organizations, there are actually seven other organizations under the same banner. They are: the political secret police, Goebbels' propaganda department, the Labor Front, the intelligence departments of the army, navy, and air force, and the embassies and consulates stationed in various countries. These agencies spend a total of $200 million annually on espionage, propaganda, reconnaissance, and persuasion. This is a considerable sum, but Hitler is willing to reduce the number of infantry troops rather than be stingy with this type of expenditure. To put it bluntly, the few great victories that this massive organization of 30,000 people has created for Hitler, when compared to the price paid and the actual benefits received, are truly immeasurable. It's like doing business, "a small investment yields huge profits," it is close to this.</p>
<p>Although the number of personnel in each branch is large, the organization and discipline are the same everywhere. Their sole creed is loyalty to Germany and service to Hitler. To achieve this goal, they resort to all kinds of means, such as fraud, threats, intimidation, and even murder, without any scruples. In the end, the German plainclothes units overseas are often instructed by their headquarters to obey the laws of their host country. However, the most important thing is to constantly instill in the minds of the people of their host country the idea that German victory is assured.</p>
<p>The organization and functions of the German army, navy, and air force intelligence departments are largely the same as those of other countries. What is particularly special is that they have a "psychological experiment" group, which has a wide range of activities. Internationally, it not only trains spies, but also the secret work of overseas secret police branches and party branches is derived from this group. In terms of worker activities, an "International Central Bureau" was established in Hamburg in 1936, allowing Germany and other countries to cooperate in undermining the labor movement in democratic countries. Members of the German Labor Front, when working abroad, often gather information on foreign ships, shops, and factories.</p>
<p>All German embassies and consulates around the world have intelligence attachés who are in charge of important propaganda work. There are 1,700 German-language daily newspapers published in various countries, with a circulation of 3 million copies. They often pay high prices to acquire various manuscripts and publish them in the newspapers. In addition, they pay attention to the local German-language radio broadcasting work. Connecting with local newspapers and attacking anti-Hitler newspapers and magazines are also their main tasks.</p>
<p>General Liederapp, director of the German Colonial Political Department, is in charge of propaganda work in the colonies of various countries. If highly confidential work is involved, the political police department often directly sends people to carry out everything. When the situation becomes tense, they focus their efforts on concentrating their strength in a certain important place. It is said that a German radio expert managed to find an insignificant position at an American broadcasting station, mingled in it, and secretly communicated news with German headquarters. There is also a secret organization that specializes in communicating with soldiers at the front lines. German espionage agencies often use German maids in foreign residences to spy on their owners' information. A Dutchman once hired a "deaf" German cook. One day, he suddenly heard her talking in the kitchen with a complete stranger in fluent "Oxford" accents. He knew something was wrong and quickly dismissed the maid, but by the time she left, several important documents had disappeared. The Germans also use young students to report news. They are sent to study abroad or exchange studies with students from other countries, and are first given espionage training before leaving the country. When they return to their country after completing their studies, they will not lack ways to serve the country.</p>
<p>During this European war, all the defeated countries, such as Poland, Norway, Denmark, and France, etc., did not escape the "blessings" of the German plainclothes units. Among them, the most ingenious and the one that Hitler considered most successful was naturally the surrender of France. Sun Tzu said: "Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated." The Germans were too familiar and too "expert" with everything about France. So they struck at the most appropriate time. No matter how many strategists and soldiers France had, they could not defeat the hard work that the Germans had accumulated over time. Even if France had a strong Maginot Line, it could not be destroyed by a wavering public mind. Moreover, France's military deployment was far inferior to that of Germany.</p>
<p>The German plan to subvert France, even from the perspective of espionage, was a "long-term" and patient endeavor. In addition to the agile and well-organized spies, they also used beautiful women as bait. Celebrated socialites such as Baroness Heimann Romm and Princess Anne-Lotte were all leaders in the women's ranks. Relying on their "beauty," they had already captivated people's hearts and made it difficult for them to control themselves, not to mention that they had all received considerable training. After they hooked up with several key figures, they took the opportunity to constantly play the "record of defeatist psychology" in the depths of their "love prisoners'" minds. They also used bought newspapers to create the brilliant theory of "non-resistance and national peace." As a result, French political figures initially thought that German propaganda was correct, and the more they listened, the more reasonable it seemed. They then entered the German spy "trap" and would never be able to escape. The German spies' slogan to the French was always: if France could give up being friends with Britain and the Soviet Union, not interfere with German actions in Central and Eastern Europe, and cede a portion of unimportant land to Italy, then France and Germany could "live in harmony" and be at peace with each other. Prime Minister Daladier's proclamation to the world two months before the war was also full of vigor and promise. Who knew that in the blink of an eye, everything would change completely. It was all thunder and no rain, truly worthy of Daladier.</p>
<p>The German efforts in espionage and propaganda in Britain were also not insignificant. The most notable example was "Lord Haw-Haw" in radio broadcasts, who broadcast unfavorable news to the British every night, trying to mess up the minds of the British people. Although bribery and buying off British people to speak for Germany did happen, the results were probably far less than those achieved in France. In the years before the war, the Germans did a lot of goodwill and friendly work among the British people. The Germans established several associations in Britain to promote Anglo-German relations, and even slogans of pro-German sentiment came from the mouths of the British people. The Germans also invited British gentlemen and ladies to visit Germany to see Hitler's German policies, and sent many noble and handsome young men to accompany them as tour guides. However, the British police were not easily fooled. On one occasion, they wanted to arrest Ramsay, a member of parliament who was secretly communicating with the Germans and endangering national security. Since Chamberlain's appeasement of Germany, the breakdown of peace, and the outbreak of war, the British have paid great attention to the activities of the German Fifth Column. At the beginning of the war, the police arrested more than 400 well-known German spies. After this purge, German espionage activities in Britain naturally decreased. However, the period of precariousness for Britain has not yet ended. Whether there will be any "surprises" in the future, we can only wait and see.</p>
<p>In this war, Hitler's performance has been mostly in the style of "many strange clouds in summer." In terms of his weapons and methods of warfare, he always used the tactic of catching people off guard and striking them hard. During air raids, bombs were attached with strange-sounding devices. During attacks, hundreds of artillery pieces concentrated their fire. Not to mention that new recruits were frightened out of their wits, even veterans were shocked by it. The trick of the Sudeten Germans when annexing Czechoslovakia had already been exposed by the world. What followed was a consistent pattern of attacking Poland, invading Norway, attacking Denmark, invading the Netherlands, and attacking France. Overall, it was smooth sailing and three times the profit.</p>
<p>The number of German spies mixed in with the Polish people was considerable. They were all under the guidance of the secret police and were regarded as industrialists, traveling salesmen, waiters, and coachmen, infiltrating the Polish people and doing counter-espionage work. In addition, there were millions of people who claimed to be loyal to Poland, but were actually undermining the country. On the eve of the war, these Germans, under the direction of Berlin, first made things difficult for the Poles, creating so-called "unfortunate incidents." Other Germans created a terror situation in the Polish countryside. Germans who could speak Polish forged orders and "commanded" everything on the radio. Some people also sent signals to the German air force at military targets, leading them to bomb. The Germans themselves admitted that if the Polish army could have held out for another two weeks, it would have created a war of attrition for Germany.</p>
<p>The successive fall of Norway and Denmark was also caused by the gains of the German plainclothes units. The conquest of the Netherlands was particularly meticulous. On the day of the invasion of the Netherlands, the Germans, hidden in large boats, occupied the famous Moerdijk Bridge in the Netherlands. As a result, the German army solved the southern war with little effort. In addition, 120,000 Germans lived in various parts of the Netherlands, cooperating internally and externally, resulting in an uncontrollable situation. Before the war, 250 German officials in The Hague used the special preferential provisions of diplomacy as the basis for all their activities. This does not include the personnel of other consulates. Hundreds to one hundred self-proclaimed German journalists traveled throughout the Netherlands, inspecting military terrain and conducting economic research. German servants constantly spied on their masters for information, copied documents, and reported to their country. As soon as the German army entered Dutch territory, these people took out their red badges and acted as guides for the army.</p>
<p>Approximately 60,000 Germans resided in Belgium. After the outbreak of the war, they were the first to destroy the Albert Canal, the first line of defense in Belgium. These 60,000 people were also guided by Germans in diplomatic, business, and art circles, creating various organizations that effectively harmed Belgium. By the time the King of Belgium announced his surrender, it was too late. The other amazing deeds of the German plainclothes units are truly too numerous to mention, but their principles and methods are largely the same as those described above.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox said: "In addition to resisting the enemy's military aggression, the next most important thing is to defend against the enemy's propaganda." Knox's emphasis on espionage activities can be known. (The End)</p>
<p>British Aircraft Heavily Bomb German Bases Across the Strait, Flames Light Up the Sky</p>
<p>London - The British Royal Air Force resumed its raids on German bases on the French coast last night. Around 10 p.m., the loud explosions of bombs dropped by the British Air Force shook the entire English Channel. From Dover, even in the shadowy darkness, the flames along the French coast could be observed. The targets of the British Royal Air Force bombing were apparently the German artillery positions in Boulogne and Calais. (2nd Associated Press)</p>
<p>Air Raid Alarms Sound Frequently Across the British Isles as German Aircraft Launch Extensive Attacks</p>
<p>London - Last night, German aircraft bombed the British Isles extensively, on a scale unprecedented since the beginning of the war. As soon as the German aircraft that carried out the night raids left, alarms sounded again in London this morning. Anti-aircraft batteries on the outskirts of the city fired furiously at the German aircraft, which soared high in the clouds, obscured by the sunlight, making them almost impossible to spot. The strengthened British anti-aircraft batteries worked hard to drive away the German aircraft last night, and the alarms were lifted before midnight, the earliest that a night raid alarm had been lifted since London became encircled by air attacks. However, many London residents suspected that the German aircraft were using a cunning trick, lingering in the suburbs and refusing to leave their shelters and trenches. Sure enough, the alarms soon sounded again throughout the city, but this time no German aircraft reached London. Some areas in the interior around London were also visited by German aircraft, but the damage was minimal and the casualties were few. A certain neutral air force expert here stated that the air raids on London yesterday and today were undoubtedly less intense than before, but the British Air Force's air raids on Germany are becoming increasingly strengthened. According to British pilots who returned from bombing the center of German troop transport ships today, Germany's preparations for the invasion of Britain, even if not completely abandoned, have become more relaxed than before. (2nd International News Service)</p>
<p>Yesterday, German Air Force Aircraft Twice Attacked London, But Encountered Fierce Fire from British Fighter Planes and Anti-Aircraft Guns, Greatly Weakening German Combat Power. After Breaching the British Air Defenses, German Aircraft Dropped Bombs in the Southeastern Corner of London, But the Strong British Anti-Aircraft Fire Drove Back the Aggressor Aircraft. In the Early Morning, Two Squadrons of German Aircraft, Each with Seven or Eight Planes, Flew Over Central London, Followed by Spitfire Fighters. They Dropped Multiple Bombs in Areas Where Londoners Were Gathered, Causing Some Casualties. Until 2 p.m., London Issued Only Two Air Raid Alerts. When the First Alert Was Issued, No Air Force Activity Was Detected in Central London, But When the Second Alert Was Issued, the Sounds of Anti-Aircraft Fire and Bomb Explosions from Southeastern London Were Clearly Audible. The Air Ministry and the Security Ministry Jointly Issued a Statement Last Night Stating That a Total of Four German Aircraft Were Shot Down Yesterday, While the British Lost Three Aircraft. The Statement Also Said That Some Bombs Were Dropped on the Coast of Wales, Causing Some Damage. (2nd Associated Press)</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Attacked London Last Night, Anti-Aircraft Batteries on the Outskirts of London Roared with Loud Explosions and Intense Fire. The Alarms Were Lifted Before Midnight, and There Was No More Activity in the Air. However, More Than An Hour Later, Enemy Aircraft Flew Towards London Again from All Directions.

<p>London - As of Noon Today, Central London Has Experienced Three Air Raids, But So Far No Major Damage Has Occurred. German Aircraft Apparently Cannot Break Through the British Fire Net, and As a Result, Most of Their Bombs Are Dropped in Southeastern London, Causing Only Minor Damage. This Morning, German Aircraft Repeatedly Attacked Southeastern Britain, But Were Intercepted and Driven Away by British Fighter Planes. According to Current Reports, Eight German Aircraft Have Been Shot Down Since Midnight, While No British Fighter Planes Have Been Lost. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin - It Was Announced Here Awhile Ago That German Aircraft Bombed London's Night-Use Airfield Last Night, Inflicting Significant Damage and Rendering It Unusable.

High-Range Artillery on the French Coast Hit a British Ship Inside the Port of Dover. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<h3>The British Coastline is Heavily Defended, with Secret Weapons Deployed to Prepare for Enemy Attacks</h3>
<p>Amazing secret weapons in British coastal military camps, which seem to make the German army afraid to approach, are now spread all over the British coast, waiting for the German army that threatens to attack. These amazing weapons, some are deployed on the ground, some are deployed in the dust, what exactly are they, the reporter cannot tell you. But the reporter discovered some unexpected events on the front line. The reporter is only in one area of the coast, but wherever he goes, he sees soldiers with determined expressions gazing at the sea, their faces are terrifying. An officer told the reporter that 2 million British troops are now gathered along the coast, guarding strategic ambush locations, preparing to repel the attacking enemy. The writer witnessed the operation of some extremely amazing weapons today. One type is specially used to deal with dive bombers. I was permitted to know the function of this weapon, but I cannot report it to the public, the reason is obvious, no need to say more. What can be said is that at the time, I almost did not believe what I saw and heard. The British also have a weapon that they hope can be used to solve the problem of German aircraft night attacks. The third type of amazing defense is on the ground, this defense is a fortress line. The British miscalculated and built this line, with the intention of stopping the German army, so they specifically named it the "Stop Line." (2nd International News Agency)</p>
<h3>Spain Will Continue to Maintain Its Status as a Non-Belligerent Nation; Suner Continues to Meet with Italy, Especially Focusing on the Mediterranean Issue</h3>
<p>Madrid - According to a semi-official announcement, Spain's position regarding the European war remains unchanged. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome - Spanish Interior Minister Suñer had a long meeting with Mussolini last night, the results of which are unknown. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Madrid - Interior Minister Suñer met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini for an hour and a half yesterday morning and is scheduled to return to Italy on Thursday. It is expected that Spain will have further political developments after Suner's return. It is rumored that the Spanish government has cracked down on a wide range of policies, but the "Daily Telegraph" quoted a telegram from Rome as saying that this trip by Suner will not cause a change in Spanish policy (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met here with Spanish Interior Minister Suñer, who had recently arrived from Berlin, to discuss plans for Spain to strengthen cooperation with the Axis powers. They met for approximately eighty-five minutes. It is reported that they discussed Spain's demands for Gibraltar and the colony of Morocco. Sources also reported that they discussed plans for the rebellion of Arabs in Africa with Spain and Italy as leaders in the Near East. Although Suñer is still in Rome meeting with Mussolini, it is believed that as soon as Suner returns to Madrid and discusses with General Franco, Spain will sign a treaty and join the Axis powers. Observers also stated that Franco, Mussolini, and Hitler may have a meeting to announce Spain's joining the Rome-Berlin Axis. Spanish Interior Minister Suner was also entertained by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday. Ciano also attended the meeting between Suner and Mussolini. (2nd Associated Press)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent said that Italian newspapers and radio broadcasts are all praising the importance of Spanish Interior Minister Suner's visit to Rome, apparently wanting to indicate that there will be an unexpected major diplomatic development in the world within the next twenty-four hours. Whether Suner will sign a special agreement in Rome is a matter of speculation, but judging from the situation, Suner may not sign a formal document joining the German-Italian-Japanese Pact, as the Tripartite Pact is aimed at the United States, and Spain is unlikely to publicly participate. German newspapers mostly stated that the Rome talks were related to the Mediterranean issue, and especially emphasized Gibraltar and North Africa. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome - An Italian official news agency said that the talks between Spanish Interior Minister Suner and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano would clarify Spain's non-belligerent status, although this talk is extremely important, but it is not expected to go beyond this scope. According to Roman political circles, the Italian side has not put pressure on Spain to abandon its non-belligerent status and participate in the war against the United States. Suner held important talks with German and Italian diplomatic officials in Berlin, and Germany and Italy regard Spain as an important member of the new European order and decided to provide it with full assistance, so that Spain can regain its due position in Europe. "The Italian Daily" said that Spain's sympathy for Germany and Italy, even if it does not develop into participation in the war, is still beneficial to the Axis powers. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<h3>Egyptian Campaign: No New Developments, Active British and Italian Air Forces</h3>

<h3>Romania: Germanization, Germans Appointed as Mayors in Twelve Major Cities Nationwide</h3>
<p>Bucharest - Foreigners in Cerninia and Banat have appointed Germans as administrative chiefs. Not only that, but in the twelve major cities of Romania, even those with only a few German residents have elected Germans as mayors and deputy mayors. From this, it can be seen that Romania is now gradually becoming a German-controlled country. The training affairs of the Romanian military are now being taken over by German and Italian pilots. Many Italian pilots have already arrived here. It is heard that the Fascist Iron Guard is now demanding the arrest of Romanian politicians who are pro-British. Sixty-seven former government officials have been imprisoned in a prison not far from Bucharest. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Bucharest - Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu sent a letter to the British Ambassador to Romania last night, promising to conduct a thorough investigation into the five British citizens recently arrested in Bucharest. The five arrested British citizens are currently under strict surveillance. Since their arrest, they have only been allowed to see visitors once, and the time was very short. British Ambassador Campbell asked the Romanian government to explain the reasons for their arrest. The Romanian Prime Minister replied to this today. The British Consul, after receiving special permission from the Romanian Prime Minister last night, went to visit the arrested British citizens for several minutes. According to the British Consul, the Romanian authorities admitted that two British citizens had been mistreated. Those arrested looked haggard, but there were no scars, and the police treatment was still good. This case is now being handled by the Ministry of Justice, and the Minister of Justice was also present when he went to visit the arrested individuals. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Approaching Double Tenth National Day: City to Celebrate Enthusiastically, Promoting Donation, Frugality, and Winter Clothing Drives, Concession Authorities to Implement Security Measures as Usual</h3>
<p>October 10th is the National Day of the Republic of China. Due to the special environment of Shanghai, people from all walks of life in the city do not intend to overdo the preparations, and have decided to follow the usual practice of hanging flags and taking holidays, and enthusiastically promoting four major campaigns. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Hanging Flags to Mark the Celebration</p>
<p>Various agencies, organizations, schools, courts at all levels, post offices, customs, shops, and households in the city, in order to commemorate the Double Tenth National Day, and in accordance with the eight-day flag-hanging method agreed upon by various public organizations and the concession authorities, will uniformly hang flags and take holidays to mark the celebration on this day. However, given the extraordinary times and the ongoing national crisis, in compliance with the central government's instructions, grand celebrations will not be held. Various organizations and schools will hold simple commemorative ceremonies separately to express their congratulations.</p>
<p>Four Major Campaigns</p>
<p>All sectors of the city have launched four major campaigns to celebrate National Day: (1) Continuing donations, (2) Frugal disaster relief, (3) Soliciting winter clothing, (4) National construction savings, in order to enrich the strength of the war of resistance and achieve final victory. It is heard that various industry associations and citizens have decided to start promoting these four campaigns on this day in order to collect a certain amount and contribute to the government and charitable organizations for distribution.</p>
<p>Joint Security Measures</p>
<p>In order to ensure the safety of the area, the two concession authorities have decided to prohibit all meetings, associations, parades, demonstrations, and other activities from the 5th onwards, and at the same time, they will begin special joint security measures, block unnecessary roads and alleys, and strictly enforce curfew laws. At the same time, all police personnel, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, and the garrison forces of various countries stationed in Shanghai will be dispatched to assist in security. As for the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, they may not be blocked.</p>
<h3>Affected by the Current Situation, the Yarn Market is Unstable, Yarn Factories are Reducing Work, Silk Factories are Mostly Closed</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Section reported for September that the economic situation of the city's industrial sector did not improve last month. A large number of yarn factories, in addition to having already stopped work on Sundays, also stopped work on Saturdays last month, and it is feared that they may continue to reduce work in the future. The decline in exchange rates has prompted speculators to purchase, but the trend has been affected by the weak purchasing power of the citizens. Fresh cocoons have not yet arrived. Only two silk factories are still working, and one of them is about to close. Some dyeing factories have resumed work due to seasonal developments, but it is feared that this will not last long. Several light bulb factories have also resumed work and are busy manufacturing small light bulbs for Christmas. Most small-capital industries are suffering a lot due to the lack of cash to purchase raw materials, while the proceeds from the sale of inventory are limited. In addition, the industrial sector in this port is greatly affected by the restrictions on the transportation of raw materials from the interior to Shanghai and the prohibition of the transportation of Shanghai goods to the interior.</p>
<p>It is heard that since the signing of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, people in the cotton yarn industry here are deeply worried that war will break out in the Far East, so the import of cotton yarn has almost completely stopped. At present, the cotton yarn stored in various yarn factories in this port is only enough for three months. However, the statement in the Japanese newspaper that the yarn factories of Chinese, British, and Japanese merchants may be forced to close down at the beginning of next year is an exaggeration. The current situation of the yarn market is very unstable, and no one can predict what the future holds. According to the manager of a major foreign cotton yarn import company, it is extremely difficult for Chinese yarn to enter Shanghai, because various restrictions make it impossible for Chinese yarn to be imported permanently, and relying solely on Chinese yarn will definitely not be able to meet the needs of various yarn factories in the city.</p>
<h3>National Musician Wei Zhongle Returns from the United States, Playing Overseas to Bring Glory to the Country, Datong Music Society Holds Meeting to Welcome</h3>
<p>Mr. Wei Zhongle, the musical director of the Datong Music Society on Songshan Road (Route Ghisi), went to the United States in 1938. He has held concerts in Washington, New York, Hollywood, San Francisco, and major cities, a total of more than 100 performances. He has won the reputation of a world-class performer and brought much glory to Chinese culture. He has now returned to China. The colleagues of the Datong Music Society and Mr. Wei's relatives and friends held a tea party at the Zhengyi Society in the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road on the morning of the day before yesterday (September 29) to express their welcome. In addition to all the members of the Datong Music Society, there were also more than 100 enthusiastic national music lovers from all walks of life, such as Zhang Boyan, Ying Sunling, Guo Jixun, Zhu Mouyuan, Ye Youyun, Wu Xinzhai, and Xu Jian. Mr. Shen, the consultant of the society, was publicly elected as chairman and delivered a welcome speech. Then, Mr. Wei reported on his experiences in the United States, and the guests gave speeches. Finally, Mr. Wei played the guqin, pipa, and erhu, and distributed autographed photos to thank the guests. A photo was taken, and the meeting adjourned. It is heard that Mr. Wei has now been hired as a music professor at Shanghai University and is planning to promote the society's affairs and enroll students with the colleagues of the Datong Music Society in order to popularize it.</p>
<h3>Wife of the British Ambassador to Japan Quietly Arrives in Shanghai, Reportedly for Private Travel Only, Reporters from Various Newspapers Were Refused Interviews</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the wife of British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, quietly arrived in Shanghai yesterday (October 1) from Tokyo on the NYK Line's "Nituta Maru." According to a British Embassy spokesman, the Ambassador's wife's visit to Shanghai is purely private and has no special purpose. Reporters from various newspapers in the city wanted to meet the Ambassador's wife this morning in order to ascertain the nature of her visit to Shanghai, but were refused. It is heard that Lady Craigie will "purchase items" in Shanghai and stay for a few days, returning to Japan in the early part of next week. She is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Makes Every Effort to Raise Prices, National Rice Nears the 100 Yuan Mark, Authorities Order All National and Foreign Rice to be Evaluated at a Fixed Price</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee held a plenary meeting the day before yesterday. All members believed that it was extremely difficult to evaluate according to the current price of rice. Therefore, it was decided to report the matter to the authorities and, after obtaining their consent, to hold another meeting to negotiate. Yesterday, the representatives received a temporary telegram from the authorities, stating that they were already aware of the difficulties in evaluation, so they only sent the prepared letter by special messenger. The representatives then stopped going to the bureau. The association will continue to meet after receiving a reply from the authorities.</p>
<p>National Rice Will Also Be Evaluated</p>
<p>It has been learned that the two concession authorities have also ordered the rice industry to fix the price of national rice. Otherwise, the price of national rice will rise frequently, and the market price of foreign rice will also follow suit. Now that the rice industry will implement this, it will, together with the representatives of the authorities, evaluate and fix the standard market price of national and foreign rice, announce it to the market, and implement it earnestly. In addition to the 5,000 tons (i.e., 50,000 bags) of No. 2 West American rice that has already been telegraphed and traded, various rice industry firms telegraphed for 2,000 tons of foreign rice from Jinan Huahang the day before yesterday. As a result of the negotiations, the transportation, insurance, and other issues have not yet been settled, so the deal has not yet been concluded. However, a large number of telegrams will be made for transactions within a few days.</p>
<p>Yesterday's New High Price</p>
<p>The rice market tea party opened as usual at 7:30 yesterday morning. The market situation was chaotic and abnormal, and people were uneasy. Speculative rice merchants became more and more active, raising prices wildly and making every effort to do so. The situation was tense and relaxed. As a result, the opening price of national rice reached a high of 96 yuan per picul. This kind of new peak is rare in Shanghai's history. However, most of the transactions were done in secret. Customers and buyers were unwilling to continue absorbing because the opening price was too high, and there were not many transactions.</p>
<p>Noodle Supply Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Cut Noodle Industry Association has a total of 376 members in the city. However, due to the hoarding of flour by some people, there is a shortage of spot goods on the market, and all members of the association are panicked. Subsequently, representatives were sent to petition the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Deputy General Manager He has now made arrangements. Four flour shops have agreed: Yuanfeng will supply 500 bags, Wanfeng 800 bags, Tongshengchang 400 bags, and Ding Houji 330 bags, a total of 2,030 bags, for the use of various cut noodle shops. The price of cut noodles has been set at 34 cents per catty, and this limit price must not be exceeded.</p>
<h3>French Concession Rent Committee to Complete Investigation Report, Chinese, Russian, and French Groups Have Submitted Reports, British and American Groups Have Not Completed Work Properly, Currently Conducting Legal Research and Will Make Concrete Recommendations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that the French Consulate recently issued an order establishing a housing committee to investigate the housing problem in the French Concession. Yesterday (October 1), according to Mr. Coquelin, chairman of the committee and legal advisor to the French Concession Municipal Council, the Chinese, Russian, and French groups of the committee have submitted detailed reports on the investigation of the housing problem, among which</p>
<p>there are not a few contradictions. As for the investigation reports of the British and American groups of the committee, which have been delayed for a long time, they will also be submitted to the committee within a week. At this point, the investigation work will be completed, and then the committee will submit recommendations to the French Consul (the honorary chairman of the committee) to improve the housing situation in the French Concession. Mr. Coquelin is currently conducting legal research on this matter in preparation</p>
<p>to make recommendations.</p>
<p>It is not yet known in what way these recommendations will be made. However, according to Mr. Coquelin, strict measures will be taken to curb the collection of small rents and arbitrary price increases, and the forced sale of furniture. At the same time, some landlords in the city have prohibited tenants from reselling their leases and demanding exorbitant transfer fees. It is heard that the recommendations to be submitted by the French Concession Rent Investigation Committee, if adopted by the French Consulate and implemented by order, will require</p>
<p>all residents to obey.</p>
<p>It is also heard that the committee will also make recommendations to the qualified judicial authorities. Due to the lack of housing in the city, some tenants take the opportunity to demand transfer fees at will when reselling their leases, and the rents charged are also unheard of, so there are quite a few people who make a great profit.</p>
<h3>August Foreign Trade, Japanese Imports Actually Rank First, Native Exports to the U.S. Reach Record High</h3>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council's Administrative and Economic Special Committee was established in accordance with the seventh resolution passed by the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in April of this year, it has been divided into groups to investigate the current administrative organization of the Shanghai Municipal Council, whether it can implement frugality, and whether it can reduce expenditures and consolidate the financial foundation. It is now known that the committee has conducted investigations on the current administrative institutions, such as the police, fire, education, and health departments, as well as the financial status of each department, and may have submitted advisory reports. The committee's work has now advanced to the study of the sources of financial revenue of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The committee attaches great importance to this work and has designated six members to form a subcommittee to conduct investigations and research. It has also asked the Shanghai Municipal Council to disclose this news so that taxpayers in the area who are concerned about the finances of the Shanghai Municipal Council can make suggestions for reference.</p>
<h3>Incident of American Sailor Being Assaulted, Case Investigation Completed, Japanese Military Officer Visited Admiral Hart Yesterday, Reportedly Discussed This Matter</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reported that U.S. naval officials in the city stated this morning (October 2) that the investigation into the incident in which U.S. Navy Seaman First Class Bennett of the USS Augusta was brutally beaten by Japanese military police in the Bank of Communications Building at No. 14 The Bund on September 29 has now been completed. The Japanese military disclosed this morning the contents of the letter sent by a U.S. naval officer to the Japanese military police unit on the night of the incident. This letter was sent by U.S. Naval Patrol Officer</p>
<p>Lieutenant Cooper</p>
<p>to Captain Matsumoto, who led the Japanese military police in the Bank of Communications Building. It stated that U.S. Navy Seaman First Class Bennett, after getting drunk, was led into the entrance of the Japanese military police barracks by a woman, purely by mistake, as he recognized the Japanese military police barracks as a hotel. He was very sorry for the inconvenience caused by this misunderstanding. U.S. naval officials stationed in Shanghai have recently confirmed that this letter was indeed issued, but it was a "spur-of-the-moment"</p>
<p>note written on the spot.</p>
<p>After the Japanese authorities announced the contents of the above letter this morning, they stated that they considered the matter to be over. However, a Japanese official said that the Japanese authorities were quite indignant about the San Francisco radio broadcast's claim that this incident was a direct "anti-American attack" launched by the Japanese side. It is heard that a Japanese naval officer boarded the USS Augusta this morning to visit the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet,</p>
<p>Admiral Hart.</p>
<p>The details of the meeting have not been disclosed, but it is heard that what was discussed was related to the incident of the American sailor being assaulted. A U.S. Navy spokesman recently told reporters that the U.S. naval patrol officer took the initiative to apologize on the spot, but it was later determined that the U.S. Navy had no reason to apologize for the assault on the sailor.</p>
<h3>British Residents Relieve London Disaster Victims, Remitted Two Batches of Donations</h3>
<p>British residents in the port, in order to relieve London from the bombings, specially responded to the London Mayor's appeal for donations to relieve the London blitz. They remitted 25,000 pounds last month, and the second batch of British gold, 1,565 pounds, was also wired to the London Mayor on the 1st for the purpose of helping civilians affected by the air raids, focusing on the affected people in the London disaster area. British residents in the port plan to raise funds to order several fighter planes to enhance air defense equipment. The donation matters are currently being assisted by the British Consulate General and the British Residents Association.</p>
<h3>Chung Hua Jih Pao, Someone Throws a Bomb</h3>
<p>The kitchen and back door of the Chung Hua Jih Pao newspaper office at No. 59 North Henan Road (i.e., the original site of the former Commodity Exhibition Hall) are both located in a small alley. At around 9 o'clock last night, a man carrying a bomb walked into the alley, reached the back door of the building, took out the bomb, and threw it through the kitchen window of the building, landing next to the typesetting room, but it did not explode. Later, the newspaper office reported it to the police station, which immediately sent a large number of detectives to investigate and conducted a thorough search in the vicinity, but the bomber had already escaped into the crowd. The bomb was later taken back to the police station for destruction. The police station is conducting a thorough investigation into the source of the bomb.</p>
<h3>Hindering Shanghai-Zhejiang Shipping, Even Sailing Boats are Detained</h3>
<p>Recent news from the Zhejiang side in Shanghai said that several large sailing boats were detained on their way to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and one was burned after being detained. Therefore, many sailing boats moored in Shanghai have decided to postpone their departure. As for the Renli, a large sailing boat loaded with goods that sailed out of the Yuxing Wharf at the 16th Pier at 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, it turned back to Shanghai because it heard that the journey was unstable. The goods loaded have all been unloaded and put on the pier.</p>
<h3>Young People Requesting Job Introductions Must Receive Appropriate Training</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section report for September, in the past nine months, the section has tried to introduce jobs to young people, all of whom were sent by various agencies. According to experience, these young people must undergo a considerable period of training. In the past, the total number of young people introduced to jobs was 150, but only 82 are currently working in factories. They should be ordered to continue to make up lessons. 58 factory apprentices were sent to the night schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council for remedial classes.</p>
<h3>French Merchant Labor Dispute Remains Stalemated; Mediator Agrees to Further Mediate; Labor Representatives' Negotiations Yesterday Yielded No Results; Water and Electricity Supply Within the Settlement Poses No Issue</h3>
<p>Following the strike on September 25th by the tram workers of the French Tramway Company, demanding improved treatment, the workers presented six provisional preconditions, requesting Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng to mediate.  After a trial mediation the day before failed to reach a satisfactory resolution, Mr. Yu agreed to mediate further, seeking an early resolution to maintain traffic and security within the Settlement. He also hoped that the company would quickly seek a reasonable solution.  As for the striking workers, they have resolved not to resume work until the six conditions are met.  It is reported that they appealed to all sectors yesterday, requesting them to uphold justice.</p>
<p>Labor Negotiations Still Yield No Results</p>
<p>To seek a swift resolution to the labor dispute, workers from the tram, bus, and engine room sections of the French Water and Electricity Company again sent two representatives, Lu Zhongsheng and Zhang Wenzhong, to the Water and Electricity General Company on Route Paul Henry/ Avenue Dubail at 2 PM yesterday. They visited the company's General Manager, Favre, requesting negotiations with the management on the issue of resuming work. However, as of 6 PM, the labor representatives had not yet returned to report. Therefore, the progress of the negotiations remains unknown.</p>
<p>Formal Negotiations Have Not Yet Begun</p>
<p>According to Favre, the company received yesterday the first set of demands from the workers since the strike began last week. According to Mr. Favre speaking to reporters, the presentation of these demands was "unofficial." Formal negotiations have not yet taken place. He stated that because these demands were presented unofficially, the conditions of the demands cannot be disclosed. However, Chinese newspapers have already disclosed these demands.</p>
<p>Most Engine Room Workers Have Resumed Work</p>
<p>Although the dispute between the engine room workers and the White Russian staff of the French Water and Electricity Company was resolved the night before, labor representatives claimed that some workers had not yet returned to work. Yesterday afternoon, a Western staff member from the engine room, Ottard, along with a Chinese employee, Su Songlin, went to the home of engine room worker Wang Lishan at 17 Xianghua Bridge, Xifahua Town, ordering the striking workers to resume work immediately, or the company would dismiss them all.</p>
<p>Water and Electricity Supply Will Not Be Interrupted</p>
<p>Yesterday, according to a senior official of the Water and Electricity Company speaking to reporters, after an unfortunate incident occurred between the entire workforce of more than two hundred engine room workers and the Russian staff the day before, the strike occurred because the dispute arose from a misunderstanding, so it was not very serious and the solution was easy to proceed. A portion of the workers have already returned to work at the plant, and although a portion of workers have not yet immediately resumed work, the authorities deeply believe that it can be resolved soon. Because of the good relationship between labor and management in the past, they will definitely not go to extremes due to this slight misunderstanding.  However, since the water and electricity incident affects the safety and security of the entire society, the company will do its best to maintain the supply and will never allow for any interruption. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will not be overly disturbed, so as not to affect the security of the Settlement.</p>
<h3>Street Flooding Gradually Recedes; Weather Clears Today; Desilting Work Neglected, Impeding Drainage; Low-Lying Areas Still Flooded Above Ankle Yesterday</h3>
<p>The cause of this massive flooding in Shanghai was the combination of high tides meeting with winds, coupled with torrential rain. However, the fact that the street flooding persisted for two days without receding was due to the neglect of desilting work, preventing effective drainage. The dredgers of the Shanghai Dredging Bureau were forcibly taken away by the Japanese side during the outbreak of the Songhu Battle in 1937. Although some have been returned after repeated negotiations between the Dredging Bureau and the Japanese authorities, many are still being withheld. Although the Dredging Bureau's dredging work has made slight progress in the past few months, it is far from the performance during normal times. It is reported that the Dredging Bureau is continuing to negotiate with the Japanese authorities to recover all the dredging equipment.</p>
<p>Alert Cancelled</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reported that the typhoon threatening Shanghai passed over the city towards the northeast between 3 and 4 AM today (the 2nd) and entered the sea northwest of Gutzlaff Island. According to information this morning, the center of the typhoon was within 32 degrees north latitude and 123.60 miles east longitude, which is 30 miles northeast of Wusong. The black typhoon signal ball suspended on top of the Jianghai Customs House was removed at 9:45 AM this morning. However, the flooding in various parts of the city will not recede immediately because it is expected that there will be another high tide at 2 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>Heavy Rainfall</p>
<p>According to the Xujiahui Observatory, Shanghai received 10.44 inches of rain from midnight on Monday to midnight on Tuesday. The amount of rainfall from 7 PM on Monday to 7 PM on Tuesday was 8.12 inches. The Xujiahui Observatory also predicts that the weather may clear up tomorrow (the 3rd). The water level of the Huangpu River reached 14 feet and 3 inches at 12 PM tomorrow night (the 1st), setting a new record high.</p>
<p>Flooding Situation in Various Areas</p>
<p>Only Avenue Foch and Avenue Edward VII remained passable in the city after the flood, becoming thoroughfares for traffic. Avenue Foch east of Route Mercier was completely free of flooding, and Avenue Edward VII was entirely dry. Vehicles could also pass through the western section of Avenue Foch without any obstruction. However, the intersection with Seymour Road had deep flooding. West of Avenue du General Mangin and Haig Road, flooding formed canals. The section of Bubbling Well Road from Hart Road to Yu Qiaqing Road was also affected by flooding. Shops along Bubbling Well Road did not pile up sandbags in advance, resulting in losses due to water damage. The Welfare Company at the corner of Park Road had 9 inches of water in the lower level. The lower-level stores of Sincere Company were unable to operate. Wing On and The Sun performed better and were able to operate as usual. Although some areas of Broadway and East Seward Road had flooding one foot deep, traffic in Hongkou was still running as usual. In the Nanshi districts, the electricity supply was cut off due to the destruction of power lines by the typhoon, plunging the areas into darkness. At the same time, the water supply was also cut off, and it was not restored until around 8 PM the night before. Some schools within the Settlement temporarily suspended classes, but most held classes, and absences were not counted. The First Special Court was flooded with more than two feet of rainwater both inside and outside the building yesterday morning due to its low elevation. Civil servants and litigants entering and leaving the court were barefoot. Criminals were also transported directly from prison vehicles to the court to which they were supposed to be delivered without being detained in the detention room yesterday.</p>
<h3>Picture of Boating</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sky over Shanghai was overcast, and the heavy rain had stopped, but the flooding on the roads could not be drained, and pedestrians wading through the water were still submerged above the ankle. Although there was no attack by wind and rain, traffic was obstructed, and the short distance seemed like ten thousand miles. The cars traveling among them stirred up waves, and the sound of the tide could be faintly heard underfoot. The picture shows the flooding on Route Mercier in the French Concession, where an American sailor is boating with a Western woman. The boatman is rowing, and passers-by are watching from the side, creating a strange sight. It is truly a rare sight in Shanghai for decades to see boats on land.</p>
<h3>Suggestion to Cast a Bronze Statue of Yu Qiaqing</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the naming of Yu Qiaqing Road. The Ningbo Association received a letter from permanent director Zhang Yanzhang yesterday, which read: "To the esteemed Ningbo Association of Shanghai, respectfully, Mr. Yu Qiaqing is a leader in the business community and is unmatched in his enthusiasm for social causes. I, Yanzhang, am young and have witnessed this personally for the past twenty-five or six years.  For example, in recent years, his achievements in rescuing the chicken farmers and stabilizing rice prices have been remarkable. In addition, during the recent labor disputes in major factories and public buses and trams, Mr. Yu, along with Mr. Yuan Ludeng and others, painstakingly mediated and ultimately succeeded.  In short, countless people depend on his survival, and countless matters rely on his ability to solve difficulties. There are those who directly benefit from his kindness, and there are those who indirectly benefit from his kindness. There is truly no way to fully express this.  Now, according to my humble opinion, I would like to ask your association to join with the Chamber of Commerce and other sectors to jointly initiate the casting of a bronze statue of Mr. Yu and erect it in the public concession at Mud City Bridge (i.e., between Yu Qiaqing Road and Beijing Road). This would highlight his merits and create a model for future generations. This would be the best way to inspire future generations to emulate Mr. Yu, which would be a crucial measure for benefiting society. The expenses can be collected from various sectors, groups, or individuals at will. If this can be implemented, I, Yanzhang, as the most junior member of the community, would also be honored.</p>

<h3>Cost of Living Index Rises Again in September; Workers' Lives Become Increasingly Difficult; Actual Income of Entire Family Is Limited; Rice Prices Are Higher Than Ever Before</h3>
<p>The following figures represent the head of household's income, other family members' income, and the actual income of worker families. The term "actual income" refers to wages and all allowances. These figures are based on a study of worker families' income and living expenses in September. The following figures show two assumed levels of living:</p>
<p>The first type (i.e., Living Level A) assumes a level lower than in 1936; the second type (i.e., Living Level B) is a minimum standard of living (unit: yuan).</p>
<p>Note: This index is compiled based on the living standards of workers before the war in 1936. Recently, due to rising costs and declining living standards, in September of this year, in terms of the cost of reduced living standards, it increased by 3.51 times compared to before the war.</p>
<h3>Wu Gaoyou Murder Case; Three Criminals Confess the Process; Principal Culprit Zhu Gengshui Is Still at Large; Zhu's Father Had a Deep Feud with the Deceased</h3>
<p>Wu Gaoyou, a 52-year-old Suzhou native, lived at 59 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. He earned a living wrapping waste paper at the *Sin Wan Pao* newspaper office and had considerable savings. At around 10 PM on the afternoon of the 25th of last month, he was smoking opium at home when he was suddenly slashed to death with a knife. Afterwards, the police station sent Detective Wu Helin to investigate, but there were no leads. It was not until the 26th of last month that it was discovered that Wu Gaoyou was killed by his son, Wu Guoliang (25 years old this year), in collusion with Zhu Gengshui and Pan Ada (25 years old this year, a native of Suzhou, living at 27 Changxing Lane, Wangzhi Road, Route Tenant de la Tour, a dung collector). Wu Guoliang, Wu's wife, Wang (27 years old, a Suzhou native), and Pan Ada were arrested, while Zhu Gengshui had already fled upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Incident Process</p>
<p>After a detailed investigation by the police station, Wu and the other three were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court yesterday afternoon. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang stated that the defendants were arrested for a murder case. As the investigation was not yet complete, he requested an extension. Detective Wu Helin Chen Yuan then described the cause of the case, stating briefly: "At around 10 PM on the afternoon of August 15th of this year, the Avenue Joffre Police Station reported to the Detective Division that someone had been hacked to death by thugs at 59 Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre. I was dispatched to investigate and learned that the victim's name was Wu Gaoyou."</p>
<p>Principal Offender at Large</p>
<p>"At the time of the incident, he was smoking opium, but his son and others remained silent and did not express any opinions, so there were no results. Later, on September 26th, it was reported in secret that this case was actually because the deceased's son, Wu Guoliang, could not bear his father's abuse and colluded with Zhu Gengshui to buy Pan Ada for 600 yuan. After the fact, Pan Ada was extorted 280 yuan by thugs and actually received 320 yuan. Based on the report, the police station immediately arrested Wu Guoliang and Pan Ada. Wu's wife, Wang, was also arrested because she also participated in the planning. However, the principal offender, Zhu Gengshui, escaped and could not be arrested."</p>
<p>Building of Hatred</p>
<p>"Pan Ada confessed that this matter was done entirely by Zhu Gengshui alone. Although I went with Zhu, I did not do anything. The deceased was slashed twenty or thirty times. According to Zhu Gengshui, his father used to work at the *Sin Wan Pao* newspaper office and was persuaded by Wu Gaoyou to quit his job. Later, his father returned to his hometown and died of illness. The newspaper office issued 1,000 yuan, which was embezzled by Wu Gaoyou. Therefore, Zhu hated him to the core and wanted to kill Wu Gaoyou at all costs, so he resorted to this tactic. Zhu Gengshui and I are cousins. Although he invited me to participate, I was afraid and ultimately did not actually participate."</p>
<p>Wu Guoliang's Confession</p>
<p>"Wu Guoliang confessed that Wu Gaoyou was my father, my mother died early, and I have a stepmother. My father lived in the front building, and I lived in the pavilion. My father usually treated me not badly. A week before the incident, Zhu Gengshui came to me and said that his father and my father had a feud over the *Sin Wan Pao* newspaper office business. Recently, Zhu Gengshui wanted my father to introduce him to a job, but my father refused, and he hated him even more, wanting to kill my father at all costs. I advised Zhu Gengshui at the time that this should not be done, but Zhu Gengshui was very determined and told me not to interfere and that he would bear all the responsibility. Later, on August 15th, Zhu Gengshui did do this thing."</p>
<p>Discord Between Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law</p>
<p>"However, my wife, Wang, learned about this matter beforehand and had discussed it with Zhu Gengshui because Wang had a son (five years old) and a daughter (three years old), and my father did not pay for any expenses, causing a poor relationship between my stepmother and daughter-in-law. When Zhu Gengshui started, he came in from the back door, so I didn't know anything. When the police station received the report and came to investigate, the murderer Zhu Gengshui had not yet escaped and was sitting downstairs. However, Zhu threatened me and forbade me from speaking out, or else it would be bad for me, so I did not report the arrest of Zhu to the detectives." Lastly, Wu's wife, Wang, confessed that Wu Gaoyou was my father-in-law and was killed by someone Zhu Gengshui hired.</p>
<p>Wu Wang's Confession</p>
<p>"On August 15th, Zhu Gengshui said to me that because my father-in-law did not recommend him for business, he wanted to beat him to death. I said that this should not be done. Although I am not on good terms with my father-in-law and hate him very much, my conscience would not allow me to kill him. Therefore, I advised Zhu Gengshui not to kill my father-in-law. If he wanted to vent his anger, he could beat him up. Unexpectedly, he actually slashed my father-in-law to death. This matter has nothing to do with me." The court verified the confessions and, because the police department had not yet prosecuted and the case was unusually complex, requiring detailed investigation, ordered the case to be postponed until 2 PM on October 11th for further hearing. The three defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Robbers Steal Car; Original Car Found in Hongkou</h3>
<p>At approximately 6:45 AM yesterday morning, two customers at the Renji Road Yunfei Car Rental Station in the Public Concession went to hire a car. The accountant dispatched driver Yao Lan to drive car number 12275 to Anhe Temple Road in Huxi. Unexpectedly, the two passengers in the car drew out guns and forced the driver to get out of the car. One person stood by and watched, while the other drove away. After about an hour, the driver was released and reported the car theft to the police station. The purpose of the robbers stealing the car is currently under investigation. The car was later found on O'Kai Road in Hongkou.</p>
<h3>Robbers Intercept Woman; Bite Off Finger; Two Robbers Flee Without a Trace</h3>
<p>At approximately 8 AM yesterday morning, a middle-aged woman was passing by the YMCA entrance on Avenue de Montigny, Fa Concession. It was drizzling at the time, and the woman was walking along with an umbrella when a gold ring on one of her middle fingers was spotted by criminals. Two robbers approached, one grabbing her around the waist and the other trying to pull off the gold ring on her hand. Because she resisted, the robber became desperate and bit off a portion of her finger, seizing the gold ring and fleeing into Hengmao Lane across the street. The woman's hand was covered in blood, and she shouted for someone to catch the robbers. The nearby postmen heard the news and rushed to the scene, but the robbers had already escaped far away.</p>
<h3>Using Coercive Means to Pluck Pig Bristles; Slaughtering Company Unable to Bear Harassment; Six Criminals Arrested After Reporting to Police</h3>
<p>The Su Xi Slaughtering Company, located at 50, Lane 1040, North Chengdu Road, specializes in pig slaughtering. Since the 10th of last month, a man named Li Haosheng and more than a dozen Chinese men and two Japanese men have been going to the company every day to pluck pig bristles by coercive means. The company's losses each day are no less than 100 yuan or more. However, because Li and the others were accompanied by Japanese men, they dared not resist. However, as this constant loss was unbearable, they had no choice but to report it to the New Gate Police Station. At 4:30 PM on the afternoon before yesterday, the police station ordered detectives to investigate. Unexpectedly, Li and the others came again and were arrested by the detectives, including Li and his accomplices Wang Asan, Zhao Ruirong, Lu Ziwan, Shi Depei, and Yin Amao. They confessed that they were instructed by Ge Shenglin and that the plucked pig bristles were sold to the Yixing Pig Bristle Company in Hongkou. The Japanese men who went with them were also dispatched by the Yixing Company, etc. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the process and requested permission for temporary detention for investigation. After interrogating them, Judge Zhong Qing ordered that the criminals be detained for a week for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Ma Chen Abuses Maid; Sentenced to a Fine of 50 Yuan; Victim Sent to Jiliang Institute</h3>
<p>Ma Chen, a woman from Suzhou living at 22, Lane 110, Longmen Road, bought a maid named Feng Gendi (11 years old this year) in her hometown two years ago for 100 yuan. Because of carelessness in her work, she was often beaten and scolded by Ma Chen, or deprived of food. As a result, she became ill over time, resulting in a sallow and thin complexion. Yesterday, because she broke a spittoon, she was severely beaten by Ma Chen with a thin bamboo pole, leaving her covered in bruises. Feng Gendi had no choice but to endure the pain and escape. She wandered and cried in the area of Dagu Road and Mohawk Road. The Xibutou Fangteer and Chinese constable Zhang Ziqing of the Old Gate Police Station received a report and immediately rushed to Dagu Road to send Feng to the hospital for examination. Her buttocks and shoulders had stick injuries, and her nutrition was also insufficient. Fangteer then led Feng to her mistress's address and arrested her. Yesterday, she was sent to the First Special District Court and charged with abuse. After questioning by Judge Liu, Ma Chen was found guilty of injuring another person's body and was fined 50 yuan. The victim was handed over to the Jiliang Institute for care.</p>
<h3>Obstructing Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce; Liu Xiangyuan Fined</h3>
<p>The Xiangyuan Factory, established by Liu Xiangyuan, a Ningbo native, at 15 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, recently imitated the Tianchu MSG product "MSG" with a product called "Wei Jing," and its decoration, color scheme, and hall style were all imitated from the style of "MSG" in an attempt to deceive and confuse. It was discovered by the Tianchu Factory, which hired lawyers Wang Yaotang and Qian Xingzhong to report it to the Old Gate Police Station, which ordered detectives to raid the factory and seize more than 8,000 large and small empty tins and 353 filled tins. After hearing the case in the First Special District Court, Liu Xiangyuan was found not guilty. The Municipal Council, dissatisfied with the ruling, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court through lawyer Gan Zhongxian. After the interrogation was concluded, the original ruling was overturned. Liu Xiangyuan was found guilty of obstructing agriculture, industry, and commerce and was fined 200 yuan. If he converted it to labor service, it would be calculated at 2 yuan per day. The seized full and empty tins were confiscated as per the list.</p>
<h3>New Autumn Racing News</h3>
<p>With the first breeze of autumn, the Shanghai Race Club has recently been busy preparing for the autumn races. It is reported that starting this Saturday (October 5th), the club will kick off the first act of the autumn races. To enhance the interest in horse racing, there have been new developments in the analysis of the horses' rankings. For example, if a horse excels at short distances, it will be ranked as Grade A for short distances; if it excels slightly less at medium distances, it will be ranked as Grade B; and if it excels even less at long distances, it will be ranked as Grade C. The assessment is based entirely on past performance. Therefore, the same horse may have different performances in different distances and may be ranked in three different grades. If the performance is slightly different in the three distances, it may be ranked in two different grades. If the performance is similar in the three distances, it may be ranked in the same grade. This is a novel and groundbreaking method. It is expected that the races will be more exciting and that the audience will welcome it greatly, increasing their interest in research. The club's autumn grand lottery tickets have also begun to be sold. The method is the same as in the spring, with each full sheet having 11 strips and costing 10 yuan in national currency. Each strip costs 1 yuan, and the first prize is as much as 196,000 yuan. The drawing date is fast approaching. The number of tickets is limited, so buy them quickly.</p>
<h3>Dangerous Situation, Great Difficulties Ahead. Smoking Compatriots, How Precarious Your Position! Advice from One Who Hates Opium</h3>
<p>— Du Ying</p>
<p>Lie Down and Think, Sit Down and Talk, Get Up and Act</p>
<p>In this era of turbulent times, impending crises, difficult living, exorbitant land prices, and thorns everywhere, smokers can no longer afford to drift and deceive themselves. Thinking of the current hardships and future dangers, they should quit as soon as possible, restore their health, reduce their expenses, and gradually improve and adapt to the times, seeking to quit without using needles. Relying entirely on more than a decade of rich experience, catering to each person's constitution, and using noble medicines and mysterious changes, people can break free from addiction imperceptibly. When Doctor Lai administers the treatment, he increases appetite, facilitates bowel movements, ensures sound sleep, and revitalizes the spirit. Addicts will not relapse after quitting. To gain the trust of those seeking treatment, Doctor Lai of Gongjian Hospital can first prescribe medicine for a trial period. If they are satisfied, they can then formally administer the treatment. Therefore, Gongjian Hospital and Doctor Lai Gongliang are the shores that smokers cannot fail to reach. (Gongjian Hospital Address: 208 Baker Road, British Concession, Telephone: 95111)</p>
<h3>Traveler Jumps to His Death from Sixth Floor of International Hotel</h3>
<p>At 3:15 AM yesterday (the 2nd), a traveler in Room 614 on the sixth floor of the International Hotel on Bubbling Well Road, in his thirties, jumped from the window and committed suicide. He fell onto the corner of Bubbling Well Road and Park Road, his skull shattered, and died on the spot. When the traveler jumped, he was wearing a white suit, shirt, and trousers, and yellow new leather shoes. Although an ambulance quickly sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, he was too severely injured to be saved. It is reported that the traveler went to the room at 11 PM on the night of the 1st and claimed his surname was Song.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Burma Road to Open Soon; New Posture of Unity Between Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>The English-language *China Press* commented that Britain's re-opening of the Burma Road this month is still a matter of speculation, but that opening is only a matter of time, there is no doubt. If this important route is closed for more than three months, it will be truly shocking. Recently, the attitudes of Britain and the United States towards Japan's demands have become stronger than before. Since the United States lent China 25 million US dollars, there has been a new sense of unity between Britain and the United States. To say that Britain will continue to close the Burma Road and destroy this new feeling with another "appeasement" posture toward Japan is truly unimaginable. Japan may try to make the future use of the Burma Road more difficult, as Japan's use of air bases in Vietnam makes it more convenient to bomb Kunming and other parts of Yunnan than before. However, given that the Canton-Hankou Railway has been able to operate smoothly in the past under similar difficulties, the Chinese side is seeking to use this experience. If, after the Burma Road is reopened, some new anti-aircraft guns are added to protect important bridges and trails, it will be a particularly intelligent tactic. Since Japan has colluded with Germany and Italy and entered into a military alliance, Britain should at least maintain its genuinely neutral policy toward China and Japan. There seems to be no other choice. This is what the current situation allows. However, what Japan wants is certainly different. In Tokyo's attitude, any country that does not agree with its policy of aggression in Asia is considered a country that opposes Japan. Therefore, there is no doubt about the stance that countries such as Britain and the United States should take. Since these countries oppose the policy of aggression, they should at least not assist in the aggression.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>We are instructed by our client, Madam Zhou Mei Yi-hui, to forward for your perusal the news item published in the local news section of your newspaper on the 30th regarding the case of Zhou Pengling suing our client for twenty-three leather trunks. We also wish to state that since the passing of Zhou Pengling's parents, Zhou Weibin has been his guardian, and his guardian has further appointed lawyers Luo Jiaheng and Peng Jie as liquidators to settle his creditor and debtor matters. His property is therefore managed by his guardian. The news item stated that his late father and he himself should inherit property subject to the disposal of others, which is without foundation. As for the deposit of trunks and offsetting debts, these matters were all personally handled by her late husband, Zishan, in Japan ten years ago. As Yi-hui was not involved, she naturally cannot understand the facts of the matter until a detailed investigation and counter-evidence are obtained. How can it be said that she is being evasive? Since the passing of her late husband, Zishan, Yi-hui has had no income, and she struggles to make ends meet, which is well known to friends and relatives. How could she have assets worth millions? Now that this matter has been litigated, whether our firm intends to embezzle or whether there is another story will be fairly judged by the court in the future. Such inaccurate reporting is clearly misleading and should be corrected. Therefore, we urgently communicate the situation and request a prompt correction.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lawyers Lu Shaozong and Shen E</p>
<p>September 30th</p>
<p>Respected Editor:</p>
<p>Having read the correction notice from the French Tramway Company in today's newspaper, I also have further corrections to make. I have excerpted my experiences and injuries below, and I hope that the editor will publish them in the newspaper. I would be extremely grateful.</p>
<p>On September 27th, at approximately 11:30 AM, my mother and I were riding the No. 2 tram from the west to the east on the Avenue Dubail. When passing the station at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue du Père Huc, several rioters threw glass bottles filled with phosphorous-containing, highly flammable chemicals into the car. Immediately, the car filled with thick smoke, which then turned into a large fire. At this time, the car was in chaos, and passengers scrambled to escape. My mother fell from the car in the confusion and injured her hands and feet. Unfortunately, I was splashed with the chemical, which ignited my clothes and feet. My mother, in a state of panic, extinguished the fire on my body. Subsequently, the French Concession police and authorities summoned an ambulance and sent me to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Upon arrival, a foreign doctor applied medicine and bandages. Because my feet were severely burned, I had difficulty walking, so I am still hospitalized. Unfortunately, in the chaos, I lost a bag of clothing worth over two hundred yuan, stolen by unscrupulous individuals taking advantage of the fire. This unprovoked physical injury and material loss is truly heartbreaking. Now, the French Tramway Company is correcting the story to say that a woman suffered a foot abrasion while escaping. As for the report in your newspaper that shrapnel was flying everywhere, this is not factual. The French Tramway Company's statement that someone was scraped while escaping is even more inconsistent with the facts. Therefore, I am writing again to make corrections.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Xu Qilan, the injured party (The newspaper published the surname as Qian, which is a homophone.)</p>
<p>September 30th</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Having read the large-headline news item in your newspaper of October 1st, "Nanyang Model Middle School Student Tao Zhengcong Kidnapped," we have ascertained that student Tao is not a student of our school, and our school address is not on Nanyang Road. Please correct the record to avoid misunderstanding by the outside world.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Nanyang Model Middle School</p>

<h3>Chinese Cultural Association Holds First Annual Meeting Reports on Association Affairs, Amends Constitution, and Re-elects Directors</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The first annual meeting of the members of the Chinese Cultural Association was held at 2:00 PM on September 25th at the Windsor Restaurant on the third floor. Hong Kong cultural figures gathered in one hall, a grand event indeed. The meeting was presided over by Li Yinglin and followed proper etiquette. Jian Youwen and others reported on association affairs, followed by the passage of amendments to the constitution and the re-election of officers. Advisor Wang Yunwu was invited to give a speech.

Some of the proposals made by the members at that time and the outline of the work for the second half of the year have been implemented, while others have not been able to proceed due to the current situation and environmental impact.

<h3>Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association Promotes Popular Education</h3>
<p>Temporarily Establishes One School to Enroll Fifth and Sixth Grade Students (Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong Branch of the Overseas Chinese Education Association and the Kowloon Education Association, in order to promote popular education, specially organized a Popular Education Committee during Children's Day this year, electing twenty-five members including Zhang Lanzhou, Deng Zhiqing, Huang Yanqing, and Wang Shutao. The plan is to establish popular schools in Hong Kong and Kowloon to accommodate out-of-school children. It is understood that the association believes that this move is urgently needed. Currently, it is planned to first establish one senior primary school to enroll fifth and sixth grade students. Currently, the association is looking for a school site and plans to start classes this month. According to Deputy Director Deng Zhiqing, the popular school established by the association is currently planned to first establish one school. The school site will be selected in a convenient location in Central, or classrooms will be borrowed from a certain school. Enrollment can begin once preparations are complete. As for Wan Chai and Kowloon, the association will continue to establish more schools, planning to establish approximately twenty schools. However, it may be necessary to delay until next year to fully realize this plan. In terms of funding, each school is provisionally set at two hundred yuan per month. The source of funding will be the proceeds from flag sales held each year on Children's Day. The shortfall will be raised by the Education Association. The flag donation fundraising for Children's Day this year totaled more than three thousand yuan, which has been designated by the Education Association as funding for popular schools.</p>
<p>It is also understood that the Hong Kong Branch of the Overseas Chinese Education Association recently plans to find a new site in a convenient area in Central. According to reports, the association's current address is attached to the Hong Kong Bridge Middle School on Shelley Street. It is said that once the association moves to a new site, the popular school organized by the Hong Kong and Kowloon Education Association will also be attached to the new site for classes.</p>
<h3>Schools Established by the Shanghai Municipal Council Continue to Suspend Classes for One Day Due to Unreceded Floodwaters</h3>
<p>Due to the flood, the Chinese and Western schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Council suspended classes for one day yesterday. According to the person in charge of the council's education department, the schools will continue to suspend classes for one day today (the 3rd). Classes will resume once the situation has returned to normal, and a notice will be issued.</p>
<p>According to reports, other schools in the city also suspended classes yesterday due to the inconvenience of students traveling back and forth due to the flood.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Home Tutor Waiting Appointment Center</h3>
<p>When the Shanghai War broke out, people in the education community immediately created the Shanghai Home Tutor Service. Although it was only temporary, the results were remarkable. Later, it was suspended due to changes in the situation, but most of the hired teachers have continued to work until now. In order to meet the needs of supply and demand, the teachers of the former service have gathered to organize a Home Tutor Waiting Appointment Center. The correspondence address is temporarily located at 450 Hart Road. Anyone who is a university graduate, enthusiastic about education, and experienced can first provide a detailed resume and expertise and send it to the center for introduction.</p>
<h3>Elementary Schools in the City Economize on School Supplies to Save Resources and Reduce the Burden</h3>
<p>Since prices in the city have risen frequently and everything has become expensive, educational supplies have also risen day by day. The burden on the average parent has become heavier and heavier. Therefore, elementary schools in the city are all engaged in economizing on school supplies, such as making handicrafts by making the most of waste and stipulating that pencils, paper, and notebooks be used sparingly. At the same time, teachers tell stories about saving items and the difficulty of obtaining resources to encourage children to practice thrift. Educational groups in the city hope that all schools can implement this uniformly, which can not only save resources but also reduce the burden on students' parents.</p>
<h3>Children's Welfare Association Continues to Run Newspaper Boy Schools</h3>
<p>In view of the need for education for newspaper boys, the Shanghai Children's Welfare Association has continued to run four newspaper boy schools since July. More than 400 newspaper boys have enrolled, and with the support of all walks of life, the results have been quite effective. The funds needed by the school are provided by the association and donated by enthusiastic people from all walks of life who are passionate about social welfare. It is reported that the Yonggu Charity Association has been donating 200 yuan per month since August, the YMCA has donated 360 yuan, and Principal Zhang of Qingxin Girls' Middle School has donated 100 yuan. It is clear that charitable organizations and people from all walks of life in Shanghai are passionate about public welfare, which is of great benefit to out-of-school newspaper boys. It is also reported that the school plans to gradually expand if its financial resources permit, in order to popularize education for newspaper boys. It is said that they are currently planning newspaper boy boarding houses and winter clothing.</p>

<h3>Third Charity Basketball Challenge Match: Guoyou vs. Paramount, Still at the YMCA Tonight at 8:00 PM, Hoping that the Audience Strictly Observes Order</h3>
<p>The third charity basketball challenge match, originally scheduled for Liangxi vs. Paramount, will now be changed to Guoguang Alumni Team. It is scheduled to be held at 8:00 PM tonight at the YMCA Gymnasium in Baixianqiao. Tickets are divided into two types: one yuan and two yuan. They went on sale a few days ago and it is said that many have already been sold, limited to 800 to maintain order. Those who have already purchased tickets for the Liangxi match should exchange them at the original point of sale before 5:00 PM this afternoon if they wish to switch to tonight's match. It goes without saying that Paramount has Li Zhenzhong, Feng Nianhua, Chen Xianglong, and others, and their strength is unquestionable. The Guoguang Alumni Team is the leader of men's basketball in Shanghai. Guoguang Team was praised as one of the three giants of men's basketball in the isolated island with Paramount and Hualian the year before last. Li Zude is good at dribbling and shooting, Qiu Xiaoci and Wang Nanqun are brave and fierce, and Chen Bangzhen's defense is as solid as gold. In addition, Bao Songyuan, who is currently under Paramount, was borrowed from Paramount by Qian Xucang, the main force of the Guoyou Team. Therefore, Songyuan has decided to serve his mother team today, which makes him even more powerful. The team has made a comeback for charity and practiced diligently to improve cooperation. Therefore, tonight's battle is expected to be fierce, and the wonderful and tense performance will be far better than the first and second matches. The game will still be auctioned off during the halftime break. I hope that the audience will appreciate the basketball skills as the premise and stop being picky and embarrassing enthusiasts. The good impression of this challenge event is also deeply rooted in Westerners. It is reported that the Giant Team, the champion of the Western Youth B Group in the previous session, also intends to participate in the event and challenge the Nanyang Team, the champion of the United Cup A and B Groups, and is already in contact. The Guoyou team members will gather at Dasiyuan on Nanjing Road at 6:00 PM this afternoon and set off together. The lineup of both sides is as follows:</p>
<p>(Guoyou Team) (Leader) Ye Zhenfei, (Officer) Guo Zhendong, (Coach) Qian Xucang, (Captain) Li Zude, Qiu Jici, Bao Songyuan, Chen Bangzhen, Wang Nanqun, Gao Baosheng, Fan Qingxian, Zhang Jinxuan</p>
<p>(Paramount) (Leader) Gu Liancheng, (Officer) Lu Zhonghui, (Captain) Chen Xianglong, Feng Nianhua, Jia Youliang, Zhou Zhi, Yu Dehai, Gu Senkang, Li Zhenzhong, Zhang Shaoqing, Gu Likang, Wang Jinghu</p>
<h3>Charity Volleyball Fan Letter Suggestion</h3>
<p>We received a letter from Mr. Lu yesterday, which read, "Dear Editor, the recent charity basketball game was a sensation. Soccer and table tennis are also being launched. Interest in volleyball has also been very strong recently, and amateur volleyball has come to an end. The championships have all been won by Hushing, and the runner-up is Vivi. The women's championship of the Hongyi Cup was won by Vivi, and the runner-up was Hushing. From this point of view, the strength of the two teams is on par. I would like to suggest to your newspaper to launch a charity volleyball game. The women's team will be contested by Hushing and Vivi to determine who is the leader. The men's team can be contested by Hushing and Yinghua Ying. On the one hand, it can benefit the people in distress, and on the other hand, it can feast the eyes of those who love this. I don't know if you think so. Sincerely, Chen Jiazhen, October 1st, to the Sports News Editor of the Shenbao."</p>
<h3>Guangshi Cup Basketball Tournament Recent Situation of Each Group</h3>
<p>The second Guangshi Cup Basketball Tournament has been held so far, and the eight games have been completed by the headquarters. Except for the "Shi" and "Xue" group champions, which have been won by Zhongchu and the Fei Team, Xinyou in the Guang group has won all four games and still has one game left against Laoyi. There is no problem with winning, so the championship is already stable. Luping in the Zhong group has also won all four games and still has one game left against Guoguang Nei, and the championship is almost a sure thing. In the Group B, Hushing has won all three games, and Hushing has won two games, and the Group Championship will be determined this weekend. In the women's group, Jingwu has won all three games, and the championship call is extremely high. Unfortunately, Qixiu lost to them by one point, but there is still a second cycle, and it is hoped that they can avenge them. If they can defeat Jingwu at that time, there is still hope of winning the championship. Guangshi and Lianyi in Group B have not been defeated, and the championship will be contested by the two teams. The entire situation of the game is explored as follows:</p>

<h3>Yinqian Cup Table Tennis Tournament Zikang Defeats Zhonghui Yesterday</h3>
<p>In the Yinqian Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Zikang fought Zhonghui at the Zikang Table Tennis Room yesterday. Zhonghui arrived late and did not have time to practice, so they were unfamiliar. Zikang, however, was waiting for work and gave them a head-on blow. Zhonghui only relied on Yuan Genshan and Chen Qianhao to take three points. As a result, Zikang won with a score of 13 to 3. The other two games, Siming and Jincheng, won. There are four games tonight, and it is expected that they will all become one-sided situations. Zhongchu, Zhexing, Huachi, and China are expected to be confident of victory. The results are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Zikang Beats Zhonghui 13-3</p>

<h3>Food Grain Imported Rice Source Never Stops Rice Merchants Claim There Is a Problem The Price of Imported Rice Rises by One Yuan New Japonica Rice Jumps to Eighty-eight Yuan</h3>
<p>The imported rice is still shrouded in speculative air. Even though orders continue to be negotiated and goods continue to arrive in port, cargo owners, hoarders, and general operators are still doing their best to manipulate the market, spreading rumors that the rice that has been ordered may become a problem due to shipping issues, or that there may be changes. This has led to blind followers rushing to buy, and coupled with the weather, speculators are taking advantage of the opportunity, and taking over the afterglow of the day before yesterday, once asked, the shouts soared, and according to the trend at that time, it seemed that they had the general idea of going straight to the sky. However, as the price increased, although there was no sign of stopping it on the surface, there was inevitably some apprehension in the heart. As a result, the price of imported rice increased by half a yuan to one yuan, No. 1 Saigon seventy-five yuan and a half, seventy-five yuan, high-grade fire squeezed from seventy-four yuan, decided to seventy-two yuan, No. 2 Saigon sixty-nine yuan and a half, sixty-nine yuan, No. 2 Siam sixty-eight yuan, small squeeze around sixty-seven yuan, rice seal fifty-eight to ninety yuan, Yinghua Division original package recycled No. 1 Saigon, due to the rarity of goods, the market once had a shout of eighty-one to two yuan, but the inbound users disliked the high price and were not satisfied, and the current sales of imported rice were not strong, with less than four thousand bags traded.</p>
<p>Imported rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, Taikoo Company's Suiyang Wheel arrived in Shanghai, transporting 6,415 bags from Hong Kong, and stopped at the company's dock in the French Concession for unloading. Today, there are 100 bags of corn being transported to Weihaiwei. (Ancestor)</p>
<p>The exchange of thick and thin japonica rice is like a pearl, extremely valuable, and the price continues to rise by one yuan. Changbang high japonica rice ninety-six yuan, decided to Su japonica rice ninety-three yuan, Nangang early rice bucket opened ninety-three yuan to ninety-one yuan and a half.</p>
<p>The same is true for new japonica rice, which increased by another three yuan, opening at eighty-eight yuan. Taicang new yangjian and Qingjiao new Dujian, however, have more inventory than new japonica rice, and their uses are also inferior, so the price has increased slightly by one yuan. Yangjian seventy-four to five yuan, Dujian seventy-seven yuan.</p>
<p>There were no arrivals of glutinous rice, whether domestic or imported. In the face of other goods booming, they have all risen in unison, one yuan better than before. Kaijin Li Te Yuan seventy-four yuan, Chang Dan goods seventy-two to three yuan, Hong Kong goods high from seventy-four yuan, decided to around seventy yuan. Glutinous tea flour blanks are selling well and are both one yuan better, selling for sixty-five yuan and a half, decided to sixty-seven yuan and three yuan and a half, a price of only sixteen yuan and five jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Fixed at 2,000 Tons - Price Only $16.50</h3>
<p>Flour prices remained steady yesterday. The No. 2 flour mill’s base price was fixed at $16.50. Apart from supplying the daily needs of this street, there were no large-scale wholesale transactions. The actual cost of imported wheat is very high, requiring a price of over $18. Therefore, the mill welcomes supplying out-of-town sales, but restricts retail sales on Wood Street, resulting in a perceived shortage of flour. However, the price of returned goods, old cart station orders, and foreign flour tightened once before yesterday. It was heard yesterday that merchants in this street had continued to fix 2,000 tons of Australian foreign flour at a price of only $16.50. Although not spot goods, it inevitably disheartens people. Furthermore, due to rainy weather and rising tides, the roads were almost turned into swamps, resulting in sluggish transactions, while the Municipal Bureau reported that prices are stable.</p>
<p>Wheat: Continued to be sluggish due to rain, and the trading of various grains was sparse. The supply in the concession area was even more desolate. Apart from the 100 bags of new wheat from Taicang handled by the inland agents the previous two days, there were no inquiries for out-of-town sales for the time being. Japanese and Chinese mills occasionally received scattered amounts, and the price was roughly the same as before.</p>
<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Banks Concurrently Sell British Gold and American Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday’s foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC’s listed prices. The exchange rates for British and American currencies were mediocre, first slightly tight and then finally loose, allegedly due to the widely spread rumor of an economic severance between the United States and Japan. Although a certain foreign bank telegraphed for absorption in the early morning, Chinese speculators were quite willing to release funds. Furthermore, as Hong Kong telegrams continuously sold American exchange at favorable rates, the market presented a loose appearance. However, the closing price of $5.53125 was difficult to settle and sell, so the American exchange was not much different from the day before yesterday. Sterling was even cheaper, and the futures and spot prices were the same. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A Sudden Shift to Looseness Midway</p>
<p>In the early morning, both near-term and far-term large London bars were flat, the price of silver in New York remained flat, and the price of gold in London remained unchanged. Exchange rates between Britain and the United States in Shanghai did not change, while the rate of the US dollar against the pound fell by .071875, against Shanghai by a small amount of .08, and there was no market for the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, with British gold at three ounces and five one-five six two five, and American exchange at five and a half yuan, both of which were flat compared to the evening close the previous day. After opening, due to telegraphic purchases from the Hong Kong National Goods Bank, and with a strong appetite, the market tightened. At that time, Chinese speculators sold American exchange for the current month at $5.46875 to Chinese and foreign banks. It was heard that the tightest rate had been seen at $5.4375. HSBC's listed prices were announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was also announced without increase or decrease. Afterwards, the Hong Kong telegram sold sterling spot at a price of three ounces and a half to foreign banks, and also released American exchange for the current month at $5.46875 to a certain American bank and a British bank at a favorable rate. The underlying trend could be said to be stable. Approaching noon, there were no major changes. Chinese speculators continued to sell American exchange for the current month at five and a half yuan to foreign banks at favorable rates, but the closing price suddenly hardened, with British gold at three ounces and five one-five six two five, and American exchange at $5.53125. The prices for the current month and spot were the same. November British gold was at three ounces and a half, and American exchange at five and a half yuan. Compared to the previous day, the British gold futures and spot prices were the same, and the American exchange increased slightly by .03125. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 2nd (Wednesday Telegram): The opening of the exchange market this morning was reported as flat. The spot price of British exchange remained unchanged, while the spot price of American exchange contracted by .125 to 23.3125 yuan. The spot price of Shanghai exchange rose by 2 yuan to 426 yuan. The spot price of Japanese exchange tightened by .5 yuan to 105 yuan and a half. At 9:35, it loosened slightly, and the spot price of American exchange rebounded by .125 to 23.4375 yuan. At 10:15, it was reported to be loose, and the spot price of American exchange continued to loosen by .0625 to 23.5 yuan. At 11:30, it was reported to be flat, and the spot price of Shanghai exchange fell back by 1.5 yuan to 424.5 yuan. The rest remained unchanged. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Tightening</p>
<p>Tianjin, 1st (Wednesday) Telegram: The opening of the exchange market this morning was reported as flat. The spot price of British exchange tightened by .03125 to three ounces and four .0625, and the spot price of American exchange contracted by .15625 to $5.3125. The "Joint Yarn" futures disk continued to rise by 3.5 yuan to 81.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Finally Unable to Hold - Breaks Through the $5,900 Level</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market price of spot gold fell again, but the rate of decline was still slow. Many bulls were taking advantage of the lower prices and slightly adding to their positions. The price rose sharply in the morning due to the tight exchange market. Later, rumors spread that the United States would sever economic ties with Japan, and the foreign exchange market changed from flat to loose. The lack of encouragement from buyers caused hesitation, and ultimately, due to uneven supply and demand, the price broke into the 900 yuan level, with the lowest price reported at $5,850. The closing price was $5,855, which was $50 lower than the previous day's closing price. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. Half-day trading was still active, with more than 2,000 taels traded. Jewelry gold shops ultimately listed at $10 less. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Resulting in a Fall of Fifty Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, with foreign exchange reported as soft, the price surged sharply. Gold shops purchased ten taels of gold at $5,950, as the opening price, and securities firms immediately came to acquire it. It continued to rise by ten yuan, with securities firms acquiring twenty taels of gold at $5,960. Later, due to the joint release by gold and silver shops, the price eventually fell back. Gold shops sold thirty taels to silver shops at $5,930, but money changers intentionally bought it, and it was pulled up by several tens of yuan. Silver shops then acquired twenty taels from securities firms at $5,950. At that time, it was heard that foreign exchange was gradually becoming flat, and gold and silver shops continued to release, sharply pressing into the 900 yuan level. Domestic gold shops released twenty taels to securities firms at $5,885. Fortunately, due to the money changers and another silver shop increasing their bullish positions, it re-emerged from the 900 yuan level. Silver shops had a transaction of ten taels at $5,920. However, due to the dumping by securities firms, gold shops, and silver shops, supply could not meet demand, and the price continued to fall. Gold shops released ten taels to securities firms at $5,860. After a slight fluctuation, silver shops acquired twenty taels from securities firms at $5,880. Approaching noon, silver shops had a transaction of twenty taels, falling to $5,850, the lowest price of the day. In the end, gold shops acquired ten taels from silver shops at $5,855, as the closing price, which was $50 lower than the previous day. The selling price of spot gold shops was more than $10 higher than the black market price, while the purchase price was $30 lower. The current margin gold was listed at more than $50 lower than the listed price, and there were few openings. In jewelry shops, the exchange price for each tael of jewelry gold still hovered at $610 in the early morning. Towards noon, it was listed at $10 less, with major firms listing at $600, and new firms at a similar price to the above, with the purchase price being about $30 lower.</p>
<h3>Most Foreign Currencies Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw black market prices rise and then fall, with British and American gold pounds also rising and then falling, ultimately dropping by one yuan. Demand for British gold notes was not weak, and the market price rose by .5 yuan. American gold notes initially rose to $18.13, but due to rampant rumors about the economic severance between the United States and Japan, the supply from all parties suddenly increased, and the market price fell. The evening market retreated to $17.80, ultimately falling by .2 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes had a slight demand, and the market price rose slightly by .01 yuan. The supply of Japanese gold notes did not decrease, and the market price continued to fall by .015 yuan. The evening market retreated to $1.46 yuan. Korean notes continued to be strong, and the evening market rose to $1.18 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: New Cotton Jujubes Presented</h3>
<p>The first batch of Tianjin cotton jujubes arrived, consisting of over forty packages. The appearance and color were quite impressive. Being the first time seeing new products, they were particularly rare. They were cleared in full at $60. More than twenty packages of red jujubes from the prefecture also arrived, with the prices set at $45.</p>
<h3>Interest Rate Reduction on Current Deposits</h3>
<p>— Jie Xi</p>
<p>Tracing back to the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, banks in general suffered waves of bank runs at the time, and closed for several days. In view of this situation, the Ministry of Finance urgently promulgated measures to restrict withdrawals and deposits to stabilize the financial situation. At that time, banks had loaned a very large amount of money to industrial and commercial enterprises. It was not easy to demand repayment all at once, and those with deposits in the banks rushed to withdraw them. Even the cleverest housewife cannot cook without rice. Once the Ministry's order was issued, stability was achieved.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the war shifted westward, and residents in the interior were affected by the ravages of war. The propertied class continuously fled to Shanghai to seek refuge, and their funds also came with them. As a result, the use of these funds for bundling goods and hoarding, and speculating on foreign exchange, became widespread. Old depositors in banks became envious, and rushed to withdraw their deposits, leading to the subsequent "Ma Telegram" restriction order. At this time, after the maturity of long-term deposits, they were invariably converted into short-term (one or two years) and current deposits. The interest rate was not a consideration, but rather the desire for convenient liquidity and security of the principal. The total amount of checks paid out and transferred to foreign banks was shockingly large when calculated at the exchange. Foreign banks paid only 1 or 2 percent interest on current deposits, and only 1 percent or no interest on checking accounts. Although various harsh conditions were imposed, such as not accepting small deposits and reducing interest on large deposits, the Chinese people were willing to accept them. The fact that they did not haggle over the amount of interest showed the mentality of depositors in general.</p>
<p>In the past two years, funds have been moving to Shanghai, increasing daily. There are few appropriate objects for banks to lend to. Unlimited deposits lead to increased hidden costs for subsidized interest. Banks with status are unwilling to engage in risky speculation in foreign exchange and margin gold. Investing in safe foreign exchange arbitrage is favored by general current depositors. Interest rates are above 4 percent. Withdrawals are used for arbitrage. Interest rates are below 4 percent. They are redeposited to the bank for 4 percent current interest. As a result, the banks themselves, under enormous arbitrage, cannot make arbitrage because they need to prepare current deposit withdrawal balances. Although they can make arbitrage below 4 percent, slightly reducing the cost of interbank lending, the hidden costs are inevitable in the end.</p>
<p>Prices are rising steadily, and bank expenses are also increasing accordingly. How much is left from the difference between deposit and loan interest? Seeing that floating capital is not decreasing and current deposits are increasing daily, there have been discussions about lowering interest rates. After repeated joint discussions, the dates for implementation were set. The first to issue a notice was Zhejiang Industrial, followed by the Shanghai Bank. Today's newspaper reports that the savings association jointly run by China-South, Jin Cheng, Salt Industry, Continent, and that line is also reducing its current interest rate by 1 percent next month. It is not difficult to understand that banks want to consolidate their position and reduce hidden costs. It is hoped that depositors themselves will take the overall situation into consideration by promoting the conversion of current deposits to fixed-term and long-term deposits, so that funds can be fixed and easily moved inland.

<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds All See New High Prices - Foreign Stocks Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities black market was filled with rumors reflecting the sharp fall in Japanese government bonds. Investor sentiment became even more elevated. At one point, due to short covering and adding to long positions, the market prices of various bonds surged to new record highs, surpassing the highest prices on September 30th. Type A bonds broke through $6, Type B bonds approached the $60 mark, Type C bonds broke through $8, and Type D bonds also broke through $7. At closing, there was profit-taking from long positions, and the prices retreated slightly by two or three cents, but the situation was very good. Although market prices continued to advance, when compared to any commodities, gold, foreign exchange, or foreign stocks on the market, the disparity was stark. However, there are bound to be many twists and turns, and preparations must be made in advance. Yesterday's trend was initially weak in the morning and then strengthened. Type A bonds reached as high as $6. In the afternoon, buyers were very enthusiastic, and the market prices of various bonds rose all the way, reaching new highs. In terms of trading, No. 6 and Xin Fu had the best appetite. The remaining firms, such as Ding Kang, Tong Shun, Yi Tai, Jiu Fu, and general retail investors, were actively covering their short positions. However, Lian He released shares in the morning, and Tong Kang, Le Mao, Heng Kang, etc., also sold shares, so the closing price retreated slightly. In the end, the prices continued to rise by .1 or .2 to .4 yuan. The total volume traded was over $1.7 million. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Kang Yuan Canning Factory were traded at a price of $9.80.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the public stock market was quite stable, but gradually turned bleak afterwards. It was rumored that it was not yet time for Yi He shares to pay interim dividends, and at the same time, the development of the political situation was still uncertain. Market fluctuations were within a narrow range. Yesterday, the water in Japanese cities had not receded, and the writing rooms of various companies had very few customers. This was another reason for the quiet market.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Tuesday) Telegram: The listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British company stocks remained flat today. Bank stocks saw mixed ups and downs. Jardine Matheson Bank shares rose 2 shillings and 6 pence to £6.15 shillings. HSBC Bank (London Registered) shares fell £1.5 to £65.5, and Hong Kong Registered shares fell £1 to £71. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Spot Yarn First Raised, Then No "Hat" to Grab</h3>
<p>The yarn market rose and then fell, and the situation gradually entered a state of flux. This was because the price had risen by 200 to 300 yuan from the low point. A batch of profit-takers temporarily sold out to seek profit. However, some, due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials, were very optimistic about the outlook and were always unwilling to give up the amount they were absorbing. Therefore, the pulling by both sides was very dramatic. As for retail sales, Hong Kong brokers were still healthy in their appetite for 10-count coarse yarn, but other purchases were more sluggish.</p>
<p>Spot yarn opened in the morning due to the tight atmosphere in the afternoon of the previous day, and general long positions suddenly came to raise prices. The first trade was at $1,117. Unexpectedly, certain major players came out of their cages to release shares. However, the shout of buyers was still deafening, so the price of $1,110 remained for a long time. Later, it was heard that the entire city was flat and the foreign exchange was softening. The "hat grabbers" believed that there was no hat to grab, and the market was not very volatile. By the time of closing, it had fallen to $1,095. It was found that the half-day transaction statistics totaled 4,945 packages. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 5 yuan. The amount bought by each broker is listed separately on the left.</p>
<p>The situation of spot cotton is still calm. Factories have some needs, so people's hearts are still calm. However, with the extension of foreign exchange and the absence of a rise in the foreign cotton market, people's hearts are still mediocre.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was very quiet. Later, due to a portion of Wall Street's sales, the closing price fell slightly by one or two pounds. The Indian rupee fell by more than three rupees.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Trading has been very active recently, especially for long-staple fibers. All parties are well aware that the source of foreign cotton will be cut off, and the price of the overseas cotton market is higher than the price in Shanghai. The factory is competing to buy because the inventory of this raw cotton is not abundant, so the inventory is becoming increasingly scarce. It is generally expected that the cotton market will continue to rise sharply.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Inland Silk Prices Surprisingly Cheap - Shanghai Can Look, But Cannot Connect</h3>
<p>Yesterday, New York silk market spot prices were reported to be up, with Japanese silk at 85.75 cents, each rising by 8 cents. Near-term and far-term prices remained unchanged, allegedly due to the sharp stimulation of the Japanese-American political situation. Yokohama spot prices rose by 5 yuan, far-term March was not open for auction, December was 1404 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the local silk market showed signs of movement, but the amount of goods in hand was limited and the price was very firm. The current price for white factory 7/8 silk is $5,200, and special silk from Ji Li is $3,700. It is heard that foreign firms are willing to compromise, and it is hoped that they will be quite close. Furthermore, inland silk prices are surprisingly cheap. Due to the recent months of blocked silk shipments, white silk from Xidi is only around $3,200 - $3,500, but Shanghai cannot obtain it, and can only look but not connect.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Chinese and Indian Pig Iron Disappear - American Iron Rises to Replace</h3>
<p>In addition to Liugou in China, India, and Russia, pig iron is now also being shipped from the United States. The output of our Chinese products has long been cut off (it has been interrupted since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, so no goods are shipped to Shanghai). The amount of Russian goods circulating in the market is very small, and there are few inquiries. Among them, the one that can take the place of Chinese goods is Indian pig iron. Therefore, at one point, the market asked for Indian goods, resulting in increasingly broad transactions. However, since the expansion of the European war, India's production of pig iron has not been enough to meet the military needs of Britain, so there is no spot supply to Shanghai. It is now known that the spot supply in the market is scarce, so pig iron produced in the United States has risen to the occasion, and spot shipments are continuously arriving. In this market where things are valued for their scarcity, the market is unusually high. First-class goods must be opened at $870 to $880, so actual sales are sluggish due to the high price. Weaving threads with the Tiger, Flying Crane, Tianxiang Xianhe and domestic broad and narrow raw camel wool patterns were all sold at $11.50 per yard yesterday. Wei Yi Double Deer brand fine camel wool sold for $7.25, plain colors for $6.50, stripes for $5.75, and miscellaneous brands sold for around $5 each, with leather ranging from $6 to $7. Most of the prices depended on the quality and color. In recent times, the market for these various broad and narrow camel wools has been falling sharply. The poor quality ones easily shed hair, and the thin quality ones cannot resist the cold. The good quality ones are too expensive, and each foot must be cut and sold for more than $2. The sales of wool have decreased by half compared to two or three years ago. The sales of silk, satin and imported goods are also far less prosperous than before, but the lack of transport for goods to and from other ports such as Sichuan and Northern China is also a major factor. As a result, large-scale camel wool manufacturers have turned to making wool, while smaller ones have gradually stopped operating.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: 1,400 Pieces Transported to Yantai and Weihaiwei</h3>
<p>There have been many piece goods transported north in recent days. Today, 110 pieces are being transported to Weihaiwei, and 1,100 pieces are being transported to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: This Factory's Ice Small Yuan Xu</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat and slightly soft with some loosening. The guild's price fixing showed no significant changes in spot prices, with second-grade coarse white sugar remaining stable. Our company's price was 78.5 yuan, other companies' were 78 yuan, and transshipment goods were 61.9 yuan, a small yuan less than last week. Dutch Red Mark was 60 yuan, DY Mark was 59.6 yuan, Dutch Cotton White BS Mark was 75 yuan, and Taikoo Granulated White Sugar fluctuated only slightly. B Mark was 75.9 yuan, DY Mark was 73.9 yuan, HX Mark was 73.6 yuan. This factory's No. 1 Ice was 100 yuan, and Crystal Clear Ice was 101 yuan, both down by 1.5 yuan.</p>
<p>After the Incident, the Chinese silk industry immediately fell into extreme chaos. The final result was that Chinese-owned enterprises could not operate large-scale factories independently. Consequently, most of the workers engaged in sericulture were nearly left to starve. Later, silk factories in the Shanghai Concession were established one after another, and some workers were able to return to their former trades. However, tens of thousands of workers remained unemployed. Subsequently, small amounts of capital were pooled together to organize small silk-reeling workshops, each with about twenty reeling machines. Only then could the unemployed survive the difficult days after the war. During that year, business was relatively smooth due to low costs and reduced expenses. However, social order was not yet stable, and robberies were frequently reported in workshops in the surrounding countryside, making business quite challenging. Some were forced to shut down. As for the silk factories in the Shanghai Concession, they had sophisticated machinery and large scales, and the workers were able to work with peace of mind. At the end of the year, the profits were surprisingly high.</p>
<p>Last year, the sudden ban on the transport of dried cocoons caused the factories in the Concession to be unable to obtain raw materials, and they had no choice but to close down one after another. Only a small number of factories managed to transport dried cocoons from eastern Zhejiang to continue reeling silk. Most workers suffered the hardship of unemployment again. Later, they successively moved back to the interior. In order to make a living, they had to combine their resources and operate small silk-reeling workshops in a decentralized manner to overcome the difficulties. As a result, a surge of these workshops became popular for a time. In terms of business, the smooth overseas sales and the shortened exchange rates allowed silk operators to obtain unprecedented huge profits, but what we got was just leftovers.</p>

<p>Education</p>
<h3>Overthrowing the Profit-Driven Education System: A Proposal for a New School System</h3>
<p>— Xingzhi</p>
<p>Everyone hates the "commercialization of education." Teachers who are exploited under this system hate it, and even non-profit principals hate it. But what can be done? The government is distant, municipal schools are dissolving, and how can education be maintained without opening private schools? Yet outsiders indiscriminately denounce the commercialization of education in Shanghai, how can those who are genuinely enthusiastic about education not be saddened?</p>
<p>However, profit-driven schools do exist, and there are many of them. Under this system: parents are deceived, teachers are exploited, children are misled, and even we non-profit educators are greatly wronged. Therefore, for the sake of the future of education, for the sake of the practical benefits of citizens, and for the sake of the reputation of teachers, we must overthrow the profit-driven school system!</p>
<p>How can we overthrow it and build a reasonable system? The best way is to strike at the root. Therefore, we should observe the causes of the commercialization of education.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, school administrators engage in profit-driven behavior because they are responsible for the school's financial gains and losses. We must first ensure that school administrators do not need to and cannot bear this responsibility. Then, the profit-driven system will naturally diminish, and administrators will strive to improve teaching without being stingy. Teachers' salaries will certainly increase, and children's happiness will certainly be achieved.</p>
<p>So, who should be given the economic responsibility of the school?</p>
<p>In my opinion: give it to the parents. Some might say that I am talking nonsense, but no, I have reasons:</p>
<p>(1) It can make teachers understand that they are responsible to the parents, not to money, and be extra diligent in teaching.</p>
<p>(2) It can make parents understand that teachers are experts hired to represent them in educating their children, changing the parents' psychology of belittling teachers and increasing parents' concern for the school.</p>
<p>(3) Those who have the closest relationship with the children's academic level are the parents, and teachers' salaries are closely related to the children's academic level. Letting parents be responsible for the school's finances may lead to them treating teachers better!</p>
<p>(4) Originally, schools were created after the division of labor in society, as agents for parents in educating their children, so it is theoretically appropriate for economic power to belong to the parents.</p>
<p>(5) It is enough to give the parents the full power over financial gains and losses. The parents allocate office expenses to the school on a monthly basis according to the budget, and the school uses this for expenses. The administrators can avoid worrying about insufficient expenses, and the parents will not be bothered.</p>
<p>(6) As long as the parents' meeting organization is sound, the powers and functions of the school and the parents' association are clearly defined, and it is stipulated that parents do not interfere with school administration, school administration can still be unified.</p>
<p>(7) Because the parents' association represents the interests of all parents, not just a few parents, the school can still handle children's discipline impartially.</p>
<p>(8) As long as the parents' association fully entrusts the principal and grants teachers appropriate terms of office, the classrooms will be able to work without any scruples and be loyal to their duties. Moreover, parents are mobile, while the teachers are the most familiar with the school, so teachers will know that they have strong protection and will be happy to work.</p>
<p>(9) For example, if tuition fees need to be increased due to soaring prices, the parents are the approvers of the budget and can understand the school's finances more clearly, and will be able to contribute generously without causing misunderstandings.</p>
<p>(10) Because the parents are the ones who pay the tuition fees, now that the expenses are made public to the parents, the stigma of a profit-driven education system can be avoided.</p>
<p>For the above reasons, I propose:</p>
<p>(1) Parents should organize an association, elect directors, and manage school finances. Teachers and staff only have the right to submit budgets and use office expenses.</p>
<p>(2) Teachers' salaries should be increased, and those with large families should be given subsidies. They should not be transferred arbitrarily without reason, and in terms of teaching, parents can only contribute principles and should not criticize or interfere at will.</p>
<p>(3) The parents' meeting should directly hire the principal, grant them full power over facilities, with a term of one, two, four, or eight years. Teachers and staff should be recommended by the principal and hired by the parents' meeting for a term of one year, in order to unify administration.</p>
<p>(4) Tuition fees should be determined by the parents' association based on the budget, with a slight addition. At the end of the semester, based on the final accounts, the remaining funds should be returned after deducting a portion for reserve funds.</p>
<p>(5) Start-up costs should be shared by all parents. Later parents should pay a certain amount of foundation money each semester. When students graduate or withdraw for some reason, they can recover a portion or all of the foundation money or start-up costs.</p>
<p>(6) Parents whose children have left the school should still be allowed to attend parents' meetings.</p>
<p>This is the outline of the method I have proposed. I believe that the profits of these profit-driven school owners are scraped from parents on the one hand and squeezed from teachers on the other. So, if we can overthrow them and implement this new system, teachers and parents will probably benefit somewhat!</p>
<p>I remember a friend telling me that the principal of their small school can make nearly ten thousand in profit each year. Please think about it, if this money were used for public purposes, how much equipment could be added, how much could teachers' salaries be increased, and how much could tuition fees be reduced!</p>
<h3>Cannot Agree</h3>
<p>— Lin Huaying</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yan Zheng's "My Wife's Sacrifice" in the August 17th issue of this column, and then reading Mr. Chen Ming's "Not a Sacrifice" on the 26th, I couldn't help but pick up my pen and write a few words.</p>
<p>I feel that Mr. Yan Zheng's ideal: "After marriage, both go out early and return late, each fulfilling their responsibility to the country and society" is also the ideal of most people. But in reality, she is "turning around in the vegetable market, the kitchen, and the bedroom, becoming a housekeeper," resulting in "a huge sacrifice." I express my great sympathy for Mr. Yan Zheng's feelings.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Chen Ming "does not consider it a sacrifice," believing that "managing the household and supervising children is also a career," and that a capable homemaker is saving the country in her own way. This seems a bit like Hitler's style of "women return to the kitchen and the bedroom," so it's no wonder that Mr. Chen Ming himself admits: "My wife's attitude certainly cannot represent all women."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Ming believes that women going to the kitchen and bedroom is an "ideal family." In fact, there probably aren't many such "ideal families"! Because most women are feeling monotonous and bored with the life of the vegetable market - kitchen - bedroom and are not as "not considering it a sacrifice and not complaining" like Mrs. Chen!</p>
<p>According to Mr. Chen Ming, Mrs. Chen was originally a university student, skilled in debate and rich in organizational skills, and often held important positions in extracurricular activities, but after getting married and having children, she never participated in any group, and looking to the future, she will never participate in social activities again. Isn't it a pity that such a talented person as Mrs. Chen doesn't come out to "lead society" but goes to nurture little citizens? If China's 200 million women all abandon the cause of leading society in order to nurture healthy little citizens, wouldn't the country's strength be reduced by half? In this way, by the time the "little citizens" nurtured by the 200 million women become "citizens," the country will have perished, and they can only be "healthy slaves of a fallen country."</p>
<p>Of course, at present, women still need to wait for the society to become more perfect in order to completely break away from the shackles of the vegetable market - kitchen - bedroom, until social undertakings such as nurseries and public canteens are developed. But, Mr. Chen Ming does not consider the complete abandonment of social activities by Mrs. Chen, a talented leader, to be a sacrifice, which cannot be agreed upon.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Investigation</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Two People Caught</p>
<p>"You said they were originally as hot as fire, then why would Li Lan abandon him now and get to know someone named Zhao?"</p>
<p>The woman raised her eyes and glanced at Hawthorne and me, then lowered them a bit, as if hesitating, or as if she was a little shy. "I don't know about this, and I can't say anything. I'm also a little surprised. I've met that Mr. Zhao a few times. His character is neither as good as Little Yu, nor does he seem to have——"</p>
<p>"Have what?"</p>
<p>"Have——have——money." Her head drooped even lower.</p>
<p>Although she was such a rather depraved woman, she would actually show this kind of expression, which cannot but make me believe that Mencius's saying "everyone has a sense of shame and aversion" indeed has a psychological basis.</p>
<p>Hawthorne said again: "Then, what is the extent of Li Lan's relationship with that Mr. Zhao? Do you know?"</p>
<p>Anna shook her head and said: "I don't know. Li Lan never talked to me in detail about that Mr. Zhao. I only know that their acquaintance is still recent."</p>
<p>Hawthorne paused, and then suddenly asked: "Do you think that Mr. Zhao would kill Li Lan?"</p>
<p>Jiang Anna was stunned for a moment, raised her head, and asked in surprise: "Him? I don't know. I don't think he would, because they haven't known each other for long, and their feelings are certainly still very warm; and Li Lan broke up with Little Yu because of him. How could he kill her?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said: "Yes, this is indeed a contradiction. But in fact, his suspicion is heavier than Little Yu's."</p>
<p>"Strange, Mr. Hawthorne, have you already met that Mr. Zhao?"</p>
<p>"I've met him. He even shot at me."</p>
<p>Jiang Anna showed a frightened expression again. "Oh dear! I'm so sorry, are you not injured?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne shook his head. "No, this person has now been caught."</p>
<p>Jiang Anna said: "That's great. Mr. Hawthorne, I don't have any preconceived notions. As long as the real murderer is caught and Li Lan's grievances are redressed, and at the same time, we dancers have a guarantee, that's fine. I only suspect Little Yu, it's just my guess."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said: "Then, apart from these two people, do you think there are any other suspicious people?"</p>
<p>Jiang Anna stared at the floor, as if trying hard to think, and for a while it seemed that she had no clue. (125)</p>
<h3>Darkness</h3>
<p>— Lei Xing</p>
<p>We detest darkness, but we do not fear it; we expose darkness, but we do not exaggerate it.</p>
<p>This is an era of struggle between light and darkness.</p>
<p>Through the pitch black, we still see brilliance; we have a firm belief: darkness will surely pass, and light will eventually arrive. Ideals have given us courage and perseverance.</p>
<p>However, there are also many who are powerless to face the darkness squarely.</p>
<p>For example, there is a certain Mr. So-and-so who went to the mainland once, saw local corruption in politics, and returned to this isolated island to publish a series of comments; then he shook his head.</p>
<p>But, what a pitiful myopic person!</p>
<p>Our country has made so much progress in the past three years, and he can't see it—is he powerless to face the light squarely? He is frightened by the remnants of past bureaucratic politics. Of course, this is a very serious issue, but we must recognize its root and the inevitability of its cleansing.</p>
<p>We detest darkness, but we do not fear it; we expose darkness, but we do not exaggerate it. However, we must overcome darkness, and darkness will inevitably be overcome!</p>

<h3>"China" Special Correspondent Films Vietnam Newsreels</h3>
<p>— Leng Bai</p>
<p>When we appreciate feature films produced by European and American countries, we can often see very precious newsreels at the same time. The subject matter of newsreels is to broadly report news from a certain place. In the past, they only focused on entertainment, but now, due to the urgency of the international situation, they are more inclined to international propaganda. For example, before the Da Hua Cinema screened "Ten Thousand Mile Expedition," there was a newsreel about air defense in London, which not only catered to the audience's interests but also increased the audience's knowledge of air defense.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation in Vietnam has been very tense, which is related to our country's war of resistance, so it has attracted the attention of the general public. Therefore, the China Film Studio specially dispatched Zhu Shuhong, a military education film photographer from the studio, to Vietnam to capture newsreels within the possible range. Indeed, it is a kind of mobile education for resisting Japan and building the nation.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Zhu Shuhong has captured many scenes of our efforts to rescue materials along the Vietnamese border with a cautious and agile attitude and has already sent them to the general factory in Chongqing. The factory believes that it is satisfactory after developing and editing the footage, and it will be shown in the "China" October newsreel. It is a pity that our compatriots in Shanghai cannot see it for the time being!</p>
<h3>Recording the Three Leads of "Earthbound"</h3>
<p>— Sha Wei</p>
<p>"Earthbound" is another film similar to "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" and "Merrily We Live." The three leading actors in the film can also be considered box-office stars in Hollywood. The first is Warner Baxter, who plays the "ghost" in "Earthbound." He has been in the film industry for more than ten years and used to be a popular star on par with big stars like John Barrymore. This film is his first film after making a comeback. With his resolute and decisive style and mature and steady acting skills, it should not be difficult for him to restore his past glory.</p>
<p>Andrea Leeds, since she married businessman Bobo last year, has also retired from the film industry to focus on her family. Recently, she has returned to Fox Studios. If she weren't on the screen, she would already be a highly respected female writer. When she was in school, she had a deep understanding of literature. Later, at a certain charity performance, she was fortunate enough to have her acting skills appreciated by a producer. After a screen test, she was cast as Edward Arnold's daughter in "Stage Door," laying a good foundation for her ascent to stardom.</p>
<p>Although Ko-Pah-Li's name is not as well-known as the previous two, her screen career started quite early, but the role she played in "The Adventures of Robin Hood" was not important and went unnoticed. As for how she got into the film industry, it was actually very accidental and quite interesting. Because Lin-Pah-Li hoped to become a star in the future, but was troubled by the lack of acquaintances to introduce her, she waited for opportunities at the entrance of the studio every day. One day, a large group of stars had just returned to the studio from outside. Lin-Pah-Li saw that the opportunity was rare and, with a flash of inspiration, mingled among them and sneaked in. At that time, they were preparing to shoot "The Adventures of Robin Hood." The director saw that this Miss Mo looked very good, but he didn't know why she was bumping around, so he asked about her intentions and let her make a cameo appearance in the play. Who knew that this cameo appearance would really create her current position.</p>
<p>Bester and Lin-Pah-Li in "Earthbound" are not the first collaboration. They have co-starred in "The Return of the Cisco Kid" before. This time, they added the beautiful Andrea Leeds, which shows that the eyes of box-office film merchants are quite confident.</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Naming Anniversary of Rue Yü Tsia-King</h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>The fifth anniversary of the naming of Rue Yü Tsia-King was celebrated on the 1st of this month at the Shipping Club, with a performance of Peking opera by famous amateur and professional actors. I went there in the rain at 5:30 in the evening, just as Chen Zelin and Lin Wanqing were performing the farewell scene of their determination to join the army. Mr. Chen sang and acted very energetically. Wu Shuzhou (as Lü Bu) and Li Kechang (as Ji Ling) were very well-suited for the scene of shooting the halberd at the gate of the camp. Zhao Peixin (as Pinggui) and Qiu Tianhong (as Baochuan) were both excellent in the scene of Pinggui returning to the kiln, and can be described as a perfect match. Mr. Zhao's appearance is similar to that of Ma Lianliang. Everyone said that after eighteen years, he not only didn't look old but actually looked fairer and more tender. Bi Linghong (Fengyang female), Liu Binkun (Fengyang male), and Han Jinkui (ugly young master) jointly performed the flower drum dance. Xiao Mao was beautiful and graceful, and Liu Han was also an experienced craftsman, humorous and witty, making people laugh. Liao Jiaai (as Su San) was the most popular when she appeared in the scene of Su San being escorted. The flower baskets were all over the stage, and the applause was continuous. Coupled with Han Jinkui's Chong Gongdao, they complemented each other. Yuan Ludeng was very afraid of her and said that others were sending flower baskets to support the show, so I had to pay my respects with both hands. Mr. Qiaqing watched with a smile and said that it was not easy for the quick-training class to achieve such results. Zhang Yizu's "Three Hall Trial" and Wang Zhunchen's "Power Over Nanyang," although the plots of the plays were different, they both sang and acted very energetically. Cheng Zhongfan (as Fourth Son) and Zhu Xiaoqiu (as Princess) performed "Sitting in the Palace." Mr. Cheng is the son of Governor Cheng Xuelou. His appearance was dignified, and Ms. Zhu was petite and exquisite, just like a woman. Yuan Ludeng saw that her fingers were dyed red and thought she was indeed a woman, and argued with others. After Mr. Qiaoqing confirmed it, they looked at each other and laughed. The finale was Huang Guiqiu and Sun Junqing's "Fenhe Bay." Famous actors and famous amateurs, all of them were equally skilled. Coupled with Huang Keqin's younger brother's Ding Shan, it added even more color. The performance ended at midnight.</p>
<h3>"Shen Bao" Brand Pencils Will Be Sent Out Immediately as Prizes for the Fun Quiz</h3>

<h3>Da Hu Theater Scheduled to Open This Month</h3>
<p>— Qing Xian</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, the owner of Jing'an Shopping Mall on Yu Yuan Road, seeing the development of the Shanghai film industry and the lack of suitable theaters in western Shanghai, demolished the foreign-style houses in the shopping mall and built a three-story building. The theater is located on the second and third floors, named Da Hu Theater. The downstairs is still used as a shopping mall business department. It was originally scheduled to open on October 10, but due to the slow progress of the water and wood works, the seats and paint have not been completed, so the opening date may be delayed. Regarding what films will be shown after the opening, according to the person in charge of the theater, foreign films and domestic films, first-run and second-run, will all be shown.</p>

<h3>Twenty Kinds of Yue Opera (3) Pan Fu Suo Fu</h3>
<p>Zeng Rong and Yan Lanzhen, one is the "descendant of a loyal family" who is being falsely accused by a traitorous party and is still a fugitive wanted by the authorities, and the other is the daughter of a powerful traitor. After the marriage, the young master Zeng was full of worries and always looked unhappy! Miss Yan repeatedly "questioned" him before he dared to tell her the truth. After the truth was revealed, Miss Yan was very understanding and knew that "love is more important than everything," so of course she helped her husband and betrayed her father. This section is "Pan Fu" (Questioning the Husband).</p>
<p>Zeng Rong attended a banquet at Yan's mansion, and after drinking, he wandered in the garden and mistakenly entered the specimen building, where he fell in love with Zhao Wenhua's daughter, Zhao Wanzhen, and did not return all night. It was not until Yan Lanzhen went to search for him that she found Zeng Rong in the bowl cabinet. This section is "Suo Fu" (Demanding the Husband).</p>
<p>(4) Shilin Sacrifices to the Pagoda</p>
<p>The righteous demon Bai Suzhen was imprisoned in the Leifeng Pagoda by Fahai. When she entered the pagoda, her son (Shilin) was just a month old.</p>
<p>Eighteen years later, Xu Shilin returned home in glory after passing the imperial examination and sacrificed to the pagoda to find his mother. When the mother and son met, there was a tearful aria in Yue Opera.</p>
<p>"Scholar Bai Sacrifices to the Pagoda," this story is quite popular among women.</p>
<h3>Watching the "San Lian" Second Week Performance</h3>
<p>— Zhi Xing</p>
<p>Hua Lian, Yin Lian, and Bao Lian's "San Lian" held a second week of experimental performance at the Xuantong Theater on the morning of the 20th. The programs included (1) The Red Lantern, (2) Romeo and Juliet, and (3) Little Girl. My impressions are as follows:</p>
<p>The Red Lantern - is a familiar and common script. The most important role in it is Shi Sanye. The role of Shi Sanye was played by Shi Li this time. The performance was quite successful, showing that he is a theatrical talent. The other roles were mediocre.</p>
<p>Romeo and Juliet - This is not Shakespeare's "Romeo and Juliet", but tells the story of two pairs of famous actors who play Romeo and Juliet. One pair used to enjoy great fame in the past, but now they have fallen into decline because of "old age." The other pair is in the limelight, but they often quarrel due to "professional jealousy," but in the end, they reconcile.</p>
<p>The most experienced actor was Mingxi, who played Romeo. His voice was calm and clear. Shen Ying, who played Juliet, was not bad, but her lines were too fast, making it difficult to understand. Others such as Pan Wan'er, Yan Yan, and Luo were all competent.</p>
<p>Little Girl - is the story of fighting wolves in Jiangnan. The dialogue is enough to excite people, such as "When the devils come, we will send them to the West!" The impassioned speeches aroused applause from the audience. Finally, when the little girl and her grandfather were looking at the distant large army, the little girl said excitedly: "It's ours, grandpa, the blue is like the sky above our heads, the white is like the sun's halo; the red is like our blood..." The whole audience applauded enthusiastically again.</p>
<p>The actors such as Wei Lu's little girl, Fang Bai's old man, and Lu Yu's little fool are all good, but unfortunately, Wei Lu's voice as the little girl is not pleasant to listen to. It is particularly sharp and a little hoarse. The other roles are fine.</p>
<p>As I left the theater, I was thinking: "San Lian has a bright future!"</p>
