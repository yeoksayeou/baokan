<p>社　評</p>
<h3>法國割讓全部殖民地說</h3>
<p>昨日有一電訉，據說來自倫敦，略稱法國殖民地全部割讓與德國；貝當政府已與德國訂立此次割讓密約，以德國支撑貝當政權爲交換條件；蓋因法國受了威脅的結果，竭力倡導歸農運動，自降爲農業國，而成德國工業化的附庸；此後無復工業品以與各殖民地的原料，互通有無，殖民地遂成贅疣云云。這是足聳視聽的電訉。</p>
<p>法國停止了抗戰，承認了失敗，向德義兩國宣吿了屈服，先後簽訂了停戰協定，他能否繼續保持其殖民地的全部或一部，就成爲問題。假令終於全部割讓了，這在法國與法國的友人當然異常痛心，但也不算異常的意外；即在屈服的當初，亦不難想像如此痛心的容有不免。在停戰協定中，容許法國爲了維護海外殖民地，保留其所需軍艦的武裝；此其意義，並不保障和議條件的不需法國割讓殖民地。現在正是停戰協定有效時期，和約尙未議訂；故殖民地割讓與否之應爲和議條件中之重要部分的，現在亦未確定，除非有如昨日電訉所傳，法國與德國既訂所謂密約。假令確有此密約，則在密約「密」的時期，因法國殖民地表面尙屬維持現狀，而得避免由轉讓問題所可引起的國際嚴重影響；祇因殖民地的割讓轉移，不比其他政治軍事經濟問題的可以秘密行事，故終必公開。公開之日，德國將以法屬殖民地爲據點而與國際作多方面的接觸；那時候的國際，眞是目前所難於想像的局勢了。</p>
<p>德法之間，究竟有無割讓全部殖民地的密約，自爲局外人所無從斷言；但以目前一般情况而論，此項消息，寗願不予置信。一因兩國在停戰而尙未媾和的過渡期間，成立任何重要的密約，似非常情常埋以內的舉動。二因德國目前急務，不在先向法國攫取海外的物資，而在爭取戰爭的全局勝利。三因法國雖宣告了屈服，但其一切的確定，還須視英德戰爭勝敗的程度而轉移，目前沒有對德先行簽訂此項密約的必要。四因所謂法國全鄧殖民地，假令發生了割讓問題，則德國在取得全局勝利之後，雖有極大發言權，然一面不得不顧到共同作戰的義大利，一面不得不因美洲部份的法屬殖民地而顧到美國的門羅主義以及美洲各國的共同宣言。五因殖民地雖與工業主義爲緣，然並非謂農業國家無需殖民地；故法國今日倡導重農，不能即以反證法國決心放棄殖民地；况重農與重工亦祗是相對的分別，謂今後的法國或任何國家，是純粹的農業國家，自無異抹煞了自然進化的本質與本能。亦因貝當將軍這次當國以後，一切大刀闊斧的措施，縱使得由各種觀點，作不同的批評；『政權』之爲物，縱使富有誘惑性，往往導人於迷途，甚至於墮落；然以貝當將軍自昔迄今的人格表現而論，剛毅木訥，決非巧言令色，自私自利，爭權善變之流；故謂以保障政權作交換條件而簽訂割讓全部殖民地的密約，吾人尤至少爲貝當將軍而不能置信：况政權的運命，尤以個人爲中心的政權，其主要基礎在於民族的擁護與否，自身的健全與否，若乃未能取得民族諒解而輕訂密約，斷送屬地，以換取異國的支撑，則其政權基礎如在沙灘，將爲每一波浪所捲而絕無保障，貝當將軍何至於出此。</p>
<p>總之，法國停戰屈服了之後。其殖民地與其他一切，至少皆有發生問題的可虞；而德國於確定戰勝後之必有所獲，亦在意中；但謂德法兩國已訂密約如昨電云云，則離奇而未可遽信。</p>
<h3>美海長明日出發　視察太平洋防務　並將檢閱美海軍演習　首批國防軍徵召受訓</h3>
<p>華盛頓　海軍部昨晚宜稱、海長諾克斯上校、將於星期三日乘機離此、親自視察美國太平洋之防務，諾克期上校將考察美國沿海重要海軍設施、繼此卽將作五千哩橫跨太平洋之飛行、以五日時間檢閱美國海軍演習、視察舊金山海軍防禦後、海長並將乘美國巡運機飛往夏威夷、以三日時間視察珍珠港及其他陸地上之建施、諾克斯上校將於九月九日參與海軍演習、五日後、渠可及時飛抵夏威夷、再由珍珠港返　、返國途中、海長並將在聖狄愛哥稽留片刻、視察海軍船塢及海軍飛機塲、同時、渠並將檢視正在修理之過期驅逐艦數十艘、最後、渠將飛至聖彼多露之海軍根據地、九月十八日可返華盛頓、（二日合衆社電）</p>
<p>羅斯福專車　羅斯福總統、昨日發表一富有歷史性之命令、徵召國防軍六萬五千人、自九月十六日起、受一年之積極訓練、以補助國家新防禦機構人力之不足、總統此項舉動、係根據於上星期二簽字之國防軍入伍法案而發、該法案授權總統、俾渠能派遣國防軍至美國任何地點、受一年之軍訓、包括菲列濱在內、惟總統尙未表示將國防軍調至美國本部以外、總統昨日並稱、國防軍事之實力、將立卽增至七萬六千人、總統稱、其餘一五·五〇〇名之國防軍、將於最近向民間徵募、國防軍人中、已婚或須負有贍養親屬之義務者、可於數日內免除軍役、所遣員額將由徵募所得之新人加以補充、陸軍官員已完成一切準備、以容納該六萬行將報到受訓之國防軍人、衆信非但可容納彼等、並可容納武裝及給養其他一百萬人云、此一百萬人、一俟國會通過「白克滑特斯華斯」入伍法案後、卽可實行徵集、據悉、該法案可望於本週被國會通過、（二日合衆社電）</p>

<p>歐戰業談（一）</p>
<h3>邱吉爾　少年的羅曼史</h3>
<p>邱吉爾被俘之後，土人並不要他的性命。不過對他說，你雖然是個新聞記者，我們也不能讓你跑。公卿的公子我們是不能每天捉到一個的。這樣他便被禁在國立模範學校的俘虜營中，四面防範得很嚴。他雖屢次說自己是新聞記者，要求釋放，可是他們說他曾參與作戰，不得釋放。於是邱吉爾就相機越獄。總算機緣巧湊，一天晚上趁兩個守兵在抽烟閒談的時候，便跳出墻圍，混過大門，昂然走向大街而去。但這地方離開中立國葡萄牙領土德拉瓜灣尙有三百英里之遙。一到天亮，勢必偵騎四出，難於躱避了。他身上所穿的是棕色法蘭絨便服，袋中尙存七十五鎊，和四塊朱古律搪。旣沒有地圖，也沒有指南針；更其不了的，他對於荷蘭語式當地土話一句也講不來，如何可以獲得飲食，或探問路綫呢？</p>
<p>邱吉爾轉念不走又將何待，只得靠着鐵路綫在暗中摸索。大概走了兩小時，看見前面有火車站的燈火，便在離開月臺二百碼之處停了步。等了一個多鐘頭，纔見火車開來。他就不顧一切，筆登聯軸節，爬到車上，在煤屑堆中睡了一晚。翌日黎明前，他也不等火車停止，雙手執住車尾的鐵梗，又縱身躍至地上。途中覔了些水喝，覺得所走的路綫，總算沒有錯。看看天色大明，不得不找在一個山谷旁的叢樹下，躱避躱避。一直等到午夜之後，纔拔步徐行。每個橋樑上都有人駐守着，只得兜着圈子，穿叢莽涉溪流，一步步的挨着向前。可惜在監獄中一個多月缺少運動，這時候稍爲行動便覺得疲乏了。</p>
<p>他這樣的蹣跚前進，突然間看見左方有兩三處火光。那知愈行愈近，這火光乃是一個煤礦的機爐間，一座兩層的樓房。他先去敲門，不應；再敲一陣，纔聽見脚步聲，從樓梯下來，率然的把門開了。這人個子很高，身上雜亂的披上些衣，面色蒼白，　上撮黑髭。他用英語問邱吉爾道：「你要什麼？」</p>
<p>邱吉爾口述中途如何遇險，如伺摔車受傷，如何訪友不着等等，胡說了一大套。那人對他熟視了一番，又經過一陣躊躇之後，便道，好，進來罷。邱吉爾挨過他的面前走入室中，心想，不要又是監牢罷。那人把燈點了起來，把他手中所拿的手槍放在桌上。一陣靜默之後，他說，「我倒歡喜再聽你火車上失事的詳細情形呢。」我回答道：「我還是把老實話吿訴你罷。」他便冒險，坦白地說道：「我是邱吉爾，倫敦晨報隨軍記者。昨夜從潑勒托利亞逃出來。現在要到邊境去。你能幫我忙麼？」大家又默默無言的經過了一會兒。那人慢慢站起身來，去把門鎖上，於是返身向他伸手道：「感謝上帝，你會到這里來！在這二十英里內，除了這屋子之外，無論到那里，你是要被人家捉去的。我們都是英團人，當然要使你平安過去。」</p>
<p>翌晨，那人對他說，當地政府確曾四處搜尋他的踨跡。再過一天，就漸漸冷淡下來。他在地窟中躲了五天，那人又跑來對他說，十九日有一荷蘭人，要裝一批羊毛到第拉哥灣去，這荷蘭人對於英人向無惡感。他想把羊毛包堆成一個空隙，把邱吉爾藏在裏面，隨車混出邊界，就可無事了。</p>
<p>一到十九日午夜後二時，那人便領着邱吉爾到屋外，那里已呢三輛載重車等着，邱吉爾鑽人第一輛車上羊毛堆，那里有一個空隙，足容他坐臥，還備着一枝手槍，兩只燻鷄，幾塊肉，一長條麵包，一只瓜，和三瓶冷茶、雖然行程只有十六小時，也許中途躭擱，所以食物不得多預備些。</p>
<p>一路上邱吉爾心中忐忑不定，深恐再出什麼亂子。過了一晚，到達哥麥底波，已是葡萄牙境，也沒　　到檢查。邱吉爾一時心中高興，不覺把頭頸伸出羊毛堆，大聲歡呼叫喊。並且把手槍向空開了兩三響，慶祝脫險。車子開到勞萊瓜馬貴市，他便悄悄的下了車，混在人叢。走過幾條馬路，到達一所屋子，邱吉爾舉首一望，英國旗扯得高高的，原來是英國領察館了。</p>
<p>邱吉爾重返杜朋，港中憊燈結采，海陣軍長官和市長都上船向他握手道賀。在那里很快樂的過了聖延節之夜。一九〇〇年六月一日，英軍澈戰四天之後，攻下潑勒　　亞。五日晨，邱吉爾和一位將校，騎馬入城。到達國立模範學校前，邱吉爾便舉帽歡呼，裏面被監禁的英國官兵聞聲響應，於是開了監門，一湧而出；一面扯起了英陶旗，大家歡聲　　。波亞之戰至此結束。邱吉爾不久也就返國，大家對他被俘和脫險經過情形，都表示極大的興趣。從此邱吉爾的大名深深印人一般人的頭腦，這對於他從事政治生活却有很大的帮助。這時候邱吉爾年二十六歲，一九〇八年秋結婚，希望從此可以過着快樂的生活了。然而煩惱的事情卻還多着呢。（本篇完）</p>

<h3>今日歐戰一週年　滬租界仍維中立　繼續保持國際性之特質　並不因戰爭而發生紛擾</h3>
<p>去年今日、正英國對德宣戰之日、戰爭之狀態、開始於英國夏季時間上午十一時（卽上海時間下午六時）、因德國政府對於英政府要求撤退波蘭德軍之哀的美敦書、不予答復也、德國與波蘭雙方之戰事、則自九月一日後、已在進行中、波蘭市鎭多處包括首都華沙、均遭受空襲、生命之喪失甚爲重大、</p>
<p>宣戰消息反應一般</p>
<p>其時英國之戰時內閣、甫吿成立、邱吉爾出任海軍大臣、在上海、戰爭爆發消息所產生之第一反應、爲陰晦與蕭條、在英僑社團中、因鑒於戰事旣起、綏靖政府已吿終止、反有一種欣慰之感覺、法國全部動員之計劃、亦吿完成、法僑年在二十至四十九歲之間者、均向法總領事署登記、以備隨時奉召入伍、法幽後備兵一級、齊集於法兵營、</p>
<p>航務方面略感影響</p>
<p>航行情形處於混亂中、原期於九月一日抵滬之法郵船拉鮑特號、被召折回香港、據一般宣稱德籍船隻將無來滬者、但英籍輪船公司均稱、船期仍照舊實行、本埠整個市鎭尙稱安寗英國兵與法僑衝突之事、祇發生一起但無嚴重之紛擾、當時英法兩租界官員宣稱、各該界內並不因宣戰之結果、而實施特別戒備、蓋彼等認爲無此必要也、</p>
<h3>日憲兵　昨在滬西巡邏　乙區商團英美隊伍　排定接替防務日期</h3>
<p>英軍撤防後所遺防區、其中滬西一帶之丁區、原定由日軍接防、但日方迄未接替、惟自前日下午起、丁區之地豐路以西之愚園路極司斐爾一帶、突有日憲兵之巡邏隊發現、而昨日上下午、仍依然有此輩日憲兵隊、往來梭巡、據悉該項日憲兵來自鐵路綫以外、每班兵士十二名、由小隊長一名率領、昨日丁區內巡邏之日憲兵、計有兩次、上午自九時半至十一時、下午三時至四時半、又據平明社記者向關係方面探悉、公共租界乙區商團美國隊伍、定明日（四日）下午七時撤防仍由萬國商團英國隊伍接替、嗣後規定英國籍之A字大隊與鐵甲車隊輕騎隊、在虹口西區出防一星期後、再由美國籍之B字大隊出防四日、因英籍商團人數較美籍爲多、故每次出防一星期、休息四天、美籍商團則出防四日後、休息一星期、</p>

<h3>昨日兩綁案　擄去一米商　金本仁被挾上車　陸幼淵未入匪手</h3>
<p>昨日滬西越界築路白利南路及法租界亞爾培路、各發生綁票案一起、一爲仁豐碾米廠主人金本仁、被綁登祥生汽車而去、一爲海門富紳陸幼淵、未被綁去、匪徒亦均落網、茲將訪悉各情、分誌如次、</p>
<p>米商架走　夥開米廠薄具積蓄</p>
<p>金本仁、真如人、現年四十二歲、業米商、平時慘淡經營、長袖善舞、手中稍有積蓄、與友人集資開設仁豐米廠於白利南路三二三號、並在同路五〇二號分設仁豐米店一所、迄今有年、其眷屬居於店內、金每日必躬赴福州路靑蓮閣米業市塲接洽交易、習以爲常、又必先時折入米廠視察，然後搭車東行、</p>
<p>竄出綁匪架上汽車</p>
<p>昨晨十時十五分許、金甫由店中步出、擬至廠中一行、甫車經盧薛宅弄口、距離廠中不過三十餘間門面之譜、不意路側竄出綁匪六名、兩人持有手槍、對準金之胸脯、威逼恫嚇、將金强行　上預置於路旁之祥生汽車、向東經過仁豐米廠門前、疾駛而去、</p>
<p>友人送訉長女報捕</p>
<p>斯時附近順金菜館內之老闆邱順金、當塲目擊斯情、（邱與金亦相識）亟奔仁豐米店報吿金之遇綁情形、始由其長女馳往捕房呈報、按金昨遭綁架、顯係擄人勒贖性質、據悉本仁雖與人合股集資開設米廠及米店、乃近因成本過鉅、且支出浩繁、連年兵燹、家產蕩然、並非巨富、此次被綁、或係匪徒有所誤會、</p>
<p>綁匪刦用祥生汽車</p>
<p>至於綁金之汽車、係匪徒於事前設法刦得、昨晨有數人至膠州路祥生汽車分站、雇用汽車、當經該行派車夫駕駛下八四三號汽車載彼等馳赴某處、匪等旋將車夫驅逐下車、由一匪自行駕駛、旋卽西行至白利南路、綁架金本仁、藏匿無蹤、嗣後該汽車夫據情投報靜安寺捕房請緝、聞該號汽車已在戈登路發現、</p>
<p>富紳倖免　海門富紳寓居上海</p>
<p>昨日中午十二時三十五分、法租界亞爾培路亞爾培新邨一號發生綁架未遂案、據調查所悉、緣有海門紳士陸幼淵、現年四十九歲、向居海門原籍、富有家產、戰事發生後、　他萑苻、不能久居、乃携眷來滬、下居於亞爾培路亞爾培新邨一號、昨午十二時三十五分、突有五人乘坐第三八五號黑牌汽車一輛、駛抵亞爾培新邨口、</p>
<p>突來四人登門求見</p>
<p>車中下來四人、兩御淡色西裝、　人服白色綢長衫、一人着白色短衫、叩門而入、謂有要事、須與陸面晤、時陸正在樓上臥室內、由傭人上樓吿知有人求見、陸以客來不速、心知蹊蹺、囑其群詢底蘊、有何事故、傭人乃復下樓、逐一詢問姓氏、詎知內中有白色短衫者、情急不耐、聲勢洶洶、竟欲自行上樓、幸爲傭人攔阻、</p>
<p>女傭機警潛出報捕</p>
<p>另一婦傭見狀、知若輩決非善類、卽乘間由後門溜出、報吿該弄之司開捕、司閣捕因無槍械、恐難與敵、急飛吿附近崗捕、卽山崗捕通知福履里路法國防軍、請求打電話報吿捕房、當由法軍數名、趕赴出事地點協助搜查、並開兩槍示威、室內匪徒、已將陸挾住、正擬拖其下樓時、</p>
<p>探捕畢集羣落綱</p>
<p>陡聞槍聲、情知敗露、急下樓奪門圖逃、乃見來勢不佳、已難兎脫、竄入亞爾培路五五六號暫避、時法捕房已派大批探捕、分乘鐵甲車三輛馳到、遂將五五六號房屋及附近一帶加以包圍、卽由幹探多名、奮勇進入搜查、結果匪徒五人當塲被擒獲，及汽車一輛、亦一併帶回捕房究辦、事後據傭人語　者云、匪徒內有一人似名沈鵬三、係陸之鄕人、惟久不見面、不知何故率領匪徒、亦前來綁架、</p>
<h3>一菲島僑胞　對於上海之印象　給本報的一封公開訉</h3>
<p>昨有菲島僑胞李萍影君，投函本報，對於上海，感覺着無限失望和咀咒，我們讀了一遍，竟然沒有一句話可以否認，因爲他所說的都是些事實。唯其從海外歸來的僑胞，纔會看得如此眞切，讀者應該咀嚼着這些諍言，大家知所警惕罷！</p>
<p>申報社編輯先生，我從小便旅居菲島，一向受當地敎育，祖國情形，知道的很少，祖國文字，更是極感生疏了，本不敢班門弄斧，貽笑大方。但是抑不住的情感，硬迫着我走這條路，所以也祇有黑白塗鴉的寫這封信給你。在這封信裏頭，雖然沒有精彩的文字；和超絕的理論，足以使你滿意，可是每一個字句的造作，却是我辛酸眼淚的結晶啊！</p>
<p>我久慕着上海的偉大；繁榮，時時都想一贍上海的丯儀來慰生平的志願。固然，在數日前纔由那遙遠的南洋，像小孩子般的投到祖國的懷抱裏來，正希望對這慈母般的故土，哀訴着國外華僑可憐的命運和悽慘的遭遇。但是失望，完全失望，祖國不但沒有像我想像中的那樣仁慈可愛，並且還像是一個兇惡的魔鬼，時時刻刻都想把每一個同胞的生命，投到萬丈的火坑裏去。</p>
<p>我到上海雖祇一個禮拜，然而滬上的一切罪惡現象，已經充溢了我整個的腦海了。我不能不把它寫出來，作爲一個臨別的紀念和此行的感想了。</p>
<p>「舞女野鷄」多於黃浦江之鯽，什麼嚮導啦，堂子啦，鹹肉啦，還有什麼什麼啦，奇形怪狀光彩奪目，女人的市塲，似乎成爲上海一種最繁盛的買賣了，詢諸本地父老，纔知道上海居民靠着女兒生活的，何止千萬。這些話，雖太對不住上海同胞，然而事實的表現，使我不無疑惑啊！</p>
<p>「酒店舞廳」觸目皆是，其窮奢極侈之程度，實爲世界各大都市所僅見。啊！上海它過去所受的重重浩刦，至今猶深刻在每個中國人的心底，何况上海同胞，他們眼見無數先烈爲自由而流血，爲民族而捐軀，是應該怎樣的奮發努力，節約耐苦，來輔助抗戰建國的完成。但是事實却不然，他們竟迷戀着歌臺舞榭，醉生夢死的向着滅亡的路推進，這怎不令人痛心！</p>
<p>跟着窮奢極侈挺進的，就是種種罪惡和殘殺的來臨，所以綁票，暗殺的事件，日有數起，差不多把整個的上海，佈置得像一所恐懼的屠塲。在任何一個角落，都有碰到危險和死的可能性；尤其是這初從海外歸來的我，更因之而消瘦了許多。</p>
<p>朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨，這句話可以說是上海社會的一個素描。誠然，上海在一方面是燈紅酒綠，淸歌妙舞，但是在另一個境域中，則哀聲遍地，餓殍塞道，他們飢不得食，寒不得衣，貧苦之狀，慘極人寰。啊！同是中國同胞，其環境懸殊，何止天壤？我們可以看見舞廳上；酒店裏的客人，是那麼擁擠，那麼闊氣，爲什麼施捨在這羣貧苦者身上的人，又是那麼寥少？</p>
<p>明天我就想離開上海，到內地去，因爲我厭惡着上海的一切，我更咀咒着上海的同胞，我不願再在這魔窟中久留。但是淪亡區域的斷牆殘瓦，槍傷彈痕和街道上的枯形餓影，哀呼慘叫，將永遠永遠的活躍在我的心胸。</p>
<p>我不是個寫作家，不曉得怎樣修飾怎樣點綴，只有將赤顆顆的一條心，呈現在你的面前，如果你認爲有把它在貴報登出的價値，那我更得到無限的快慰。因爲這樣，可使上海沉醉着的同胞們知道海外僑胞對他們的咒駡啊！完了，祝你身心康健　李萍影</p>
<p>九，二，於滬江。</p>

<p>自滬市物價飛漲後、一般較爲貧苦民衆以生活無法維持、故均相率前往內地、從事一切後方工作、據租界當局統計、滬市人口因此業已銳减五十萬人、在過去一年中、租界空屋之出租甚爲稀少、今則已不若早先之嚴重、而可自由租得、又據法公董局發表、本年七月份界內掃集之垃圾、爲一萬九千九百七十六立方公尺、平均每日淸除約六百四十四立方公尺、而去年同期則爲二萬五千一百三十五立方公尺、平均每日爲八百十立方公尺、由此更足證明人口减少、垃圾乃亦比例銳减、</p>

<h3>潮汛已屆　昨夜秋風緊拂　颶風已過安慶風尾擾滬　吳淞防提塌毀潰決堪虞</h3>
<p>吳淞口外、近日海潮高漲、天空陰霾四佈、似有風潮氣象、砲臺灣海關燈塔、已有特別信號、警吿航行、昨日吳淞衣周塘張華浜等一帶低窪處、已有海潮浸入、惟寳山北石洞五嶽墩段、自大上海淪陷後、三年來迄未修理、致木樁砌石、倒毀頗多、泥土亦鬆陷下沉、倘一旦洪水漫漲、必有潰決之虞、傳筱庵雖曾一再派員調查險狀、勘估興修、但迄無修理之消息也</p>
<p>風過安慶</p>
<p>據大通社記者向徐家匯天文臺探悉、颶風在閩登陸後、方向北轉、越贛入皖、巳於昨晨六時、進抵北緯三十一度、東經一百十七度之處、仍向北推進、中心在六十海哩以內、查上報方位、颶風已過安慶、在南京西南、據昨晨六時南京氣象報吿、當地已有六個風力、本埠亦有四個風力、均受颶風風翼之影響、致天氣晴雨不定、</p>
<p>另一颶風</p>
<p>又據天臺報吿、太平洋另一颶風、已於昨晨六時、進抵北緯十九度、東經一百三十五度、方向北西、中心在一百二十海哩以內、查颶風進行、照此方向推進不變、上海又受嚴重威脅也、</p>
<p>航行恢復</p>
<p>此次颶風本市昨日倖免吹襲海關前日下午三時、懸掛第二次颶風信號黑球一枚、亦已於昨晨五時半卸落、本市航行警報解除、進出口船隻恢復、太古海口）浙江·怡和富陞（昨報誤阜生·等輪、昨日已出口、美國總統輪船公司批亞士總統號、昨晨準時到滬、原定今晨二時（卽昨晚午夜啟　離滬、赴日返美、茲悉裝卸貨物不及、改今日中午十二時半（夏季時間、出口、接客小輪末次今午十一時正、自新關碼頭開往、渣華公司新郵船芝渣連加號、改今晨抵埠、停靠浦東藍烟囱碼頭、怡和洋行裕生輸、太古公司太原瓊州兩輪、約今日可到、盛京輪昨晨自靑開來、因海面颶風、仍退回靑島避風、今日恐不及到埠、</p>

<h3>評價提高　輿論沸騰</h3>
<p>米糧評價委員會昨日分函各該機關團體、准予轉函各業公會暨各大工廠商號、一致推動集團購米、俾免大宗食米、被投機米商操縱壟斷、同時使市上食米鮮人問津、米棧存底亦可遂之驟增、非特解除市民個人痛楚、並可安定社會秩序、聞以上四機關團體於接函後、決將分別照辦、</p>
<p>米價回降</p>
<p>米行茶會市塲昨晨循例於七時半開做、市塲現貨充斥、大戶非特停扒、並將囤藏食米大量獲利了結、同時米號納胃不强、客路亦隨滯呆、結果較諸前市猛降一元左右、除西貢一號米站定原盤外、其餘各檔洋米價似已漸進六十元關、據市塲管理委員云、係滬越航運已證實恢復之故、</p>
<p>評價與論</p>
<p>最近米價評價委員會會商結果、竟將各項米價予以一律評高兩元、乃輿論沸騰、羣情激昂、一致公認在斯百物翔貴之際、若再將米價飛增、則市民生活勢將愈感不易、而評價委員會之竟予寬放限價、實非必要、更無確鑿原因、故莫不引頸瞻望有關各當局、予以制止、再度評小米價、庶解市民痛楚、</p>

<p>該公司公共汽車三輛之玻璃窗、致車中搭客、受驚個淺、暴徒行兇、約歷十分鐘之久、旣無公洪租界巡捕到塲、亦不見「市警」蹤跡、查該區前在英軍防區之內、上週間、英軍陸續撤離上海、該處居民深恐旣無英軍防守、亦乏適當之警務保護、則不久將復起類似昨夜之</p>
<p>暴行事件</p>
<p>據目擊者稱、暴徒先在大西路登二路公共汽車一輛、前往哥侖比亞路、但不付車資、車上查票員一人迫令購票、暴徒竟袖出手槍與手溜彈、勒令停車、暴徒數人先行下車、餘者則數次圍毆查票員、幸</p>
<p>未受重傷</p>
<p>暴徒逞兇下車後、意猶未足、紛將車窗玻璃搗碎、同時、另有公共汽車兩輛、從對面駛來、亦遭暴徒　住、搗碎玻璃、暴徒未施刦掠、似以乘客受驚爲滿足、終乃揮舞手槍與手溜彈、呼嘯奔入路旁鄉野逸去、</p>

<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以人心因外滙吿硬而疲、且週末暗盤本已做小、首由金號出銀號三十兩、爲六千一百六十元、繼因證劵幫忽來收買、一度曾見回升、證劵幫互做二十兩、高爲六千一百八十元、奈外滙仍報鬆動、高價買者頗少、加之銀號金號幫多頭出籠、而某錢兌業空頭乘勢加碼、且市上有某種利空消息、故未幾在落七十五元、錢兌業出金號二十兩、退爲六千一百零五元、旋幸空戶見低抵補、金號等亦反出爲進、不久竟又升至六千一百七十元、後以錢兌業等復乘高拋空、而金號斯時重賣、收盤前復見跌至六千一百零五元、惟收盤前人心轉佳、銀號幫重新做多、故收市尙有六千一百四十八元、收後銀號幫續買、塲外做過六千一百七十元、午後開市仍疲、錢兌業出金號十兩、爲六千一百五十元、嗣賴證劵幫等扒進、曾高爲六千一百六十五元、惟銀號幫及金號吐出、價易向下、低至六千一百二十五元、入後賣者驟减、銀號幫反來買進、金號亦稍跟扒、故結果爲六千一百五十五元收市、比上週六軋跌五十五元、收後先堅後平、一度做過六千一百六十五元、然最後六千一百六十元有人肯賣、全天七十五元上落、現金號本牌金售出價、照赤烚較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金掛價不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日不動、大同行仍懸六百三十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>日票大跌</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤盤旋轉跌、英美金鎊亦各小一元、英金票仍有少數交易、市價站平、美金票起落靡常、終小六分、香港票亦降一分、日金票需要大减、市價暴落、晚市退至一元六角七分半、比上週六猛降一角四分半、朝鮮票跟蹤下趨、晚市退爲一元零八分、比上週六亦小六分、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米次貨　用以應市</h3>
<p>存底充足、供多銷細、一味空抬之洋米高價、雖得評價委員會之支持、昨已頓見回風矣、但以行囤大戶堅守不出、故昨市高貨洋米如一號西貢暹邏之米、堅持前日高行情、不肯减低、乃將次米有回低元半至一元光景不等、以期遮人耳目、此種巧妙手腕、米商優爲之、英華司原包、連日多被浮戶散國所操縱、所謂搶帽子與皮球生意者允致力於此、一經實銷不動、大戶觀望、新囤繼起乏力、市卽不支下墜、上週六開轉棧連兵險之二號暹米七十二元半者、昨祇七十元零四角、前開連兵險七十二元者、昨祇七十元、轉口者、昨祗六十九元及六十八元半、乃目銳落二元半、小紋西貢與碎米均以乏胃未開、全日現米成交已七至四千包、原包亦祇三百六七十噸、</p>
<p>粳糯國米、到貨雖仍寥落、但以價盤同已轟足、所以傳聞明暗市相隨洋米疲勢、交易旣稀、價降元砠、常幫白粳七十一元、無錫淸粳七十元、常州蘇崑粳高自六十八九元次至六十六七元、南港原包鮮早稻六十九元、斛見六十五六元、糯米金溧特元六十六七元、常丹貨六十四五元、香港特元六十六七元、普通六十四五元云云、周浦新粳來源續祗三四十担、受他貨牽制、亦難立足、帶落半元、開六十六元、</p>
<h3>新到美粉　大批轉往南北說</h3>
<p>二號粉廠盤、仍為十五元、銷塲亦以本街為主、因號粉廠盤、仍爲十五元、銷塲亦以本街爲主、因月餅汎中、各茶食號逐有添備、外埠交易、卒以運輸不便、去路頗懈、市面平靜、惟投機注目之日粉鳳凰牌市况、則以米價回跌、人心轉多頭出籠、價疲跌、三五分至一角、計開現粉十四元四角七分、九月份十四元九角至八角半、十月份十五元〇九分至十五元、成交僅五千餘包、</p>
<p>又訊　本市上月間新到有美國洋粉、如砲台雙鷹旭日當天等脾、昨日市傳該粉已大批轉口運往南北客埠、額計不下十萬包、故市上洋粉反見俏利、喊價竟達十七元、普通貨價爲十六元四五角、本街稍有取辦云、</p>
<p>麥市復趨擯局、因邇來內地到貨减少、粉銷頗爲活動、各廠進胃似覺貪取、福阜兩廠曾一度放價半元、牧進附近崑山南翔等麥三四百包、更引起行販之居奇、惟日廠方面、吃盤重視、每日收進二三千包、價仍爲二十一元左右、市面尙難開展、</p>
<h3>證券　游資充裕　公債難小</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、上午劇漲之後、漸漸轉疲、一般人以爲初以海防形勢和緩而漲、繼以上海租界謠言而跌、其實殊不盡然、此次公債上漲繼續一星期、計已好起二三元、故不免引起多頭之出籠、此亦投機家固有之作風、與公債整個趨勢毫無關係、因投資者把持甚堅、自外滙無利可套、金子上漲過鉅後、游資之充裕爲最近數月罕有之現象、觀金子一再上漲、而貼水反見下跌、卽可證明游資充裕之說、公債尙在五二三折之譜、投資尙有一分以上利息可圖、時局淸明、市價上騰、尙屬在外、故此種多頭出籠引起之回風、並未能將隔日收盤價壓低、足證人心之堅穩、前途或盤旋一二日、再候其他消息而起動作、昨日上午仁昌協大買進甚湧、鴻大久豐恒康震康均有進胃、市價一再上騰、丙種高至三元六角半、因此引起多頭出籠、如德孚同康信孚恒孚大通或多或少、均有賣出、市價高低相差三角半、午後信孚恒康出籠尤湧、鴻大因亦轉賣、聯益稍有出脫、四十一號入甲出丙較爲便宜、恒孚初出後進、市價壓小二三角、但以聯和久豐同康胡鶴記樂茂買進而堅定、一日結果、除甲種微小一角外、餘仍好起二角至七角半、成交約一百六七十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交寗紹輪船公司股三十股、價爲十三元正、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市蓬勃、當歸功於週末政治消息之平穩、以及紐約市塲之堅俏、實業股自始卽堅、若會德豐·怡和·英聯·業廣等則竟日挺昂、極鮮回風、成交龐大、</p>
<p>橡皮股趨勢軟化、蓋有一種不利消息傳來、謂各公司營業利得、由新加坡爪哇等地滙寄、此後將受一種新條例限制、聞本埠各代理商據情業已去電訊問究竟、不難得其虛實、新加坡爪哇各公司對於此次戰事貢獻之努力、雖亦不應後人、必需盡其本身相當之責職、但願其所出者、不若謠傳計算方法之甚、蓋此而屬實、則此後之橡皮股息、較之一九三七年與三八年度所派者將更微小、</p>
<h3>紗花　傳滬防防航機可通　紗價看好　—無如存紗出積—</h3>
<p>紗市趨昂、漲風稍起、但實際交易依然平庸、惟投機人心大都看好、但查其實際性質、均抱搶帽子全義也、不過市塲盛傳滬防航綫、又可恢復通行、於是投機買風驟熾、市盤向升、但棉紗存底步增高已超過三十萬包以外矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、塲中氣勢和平、二十支雙馬價爲九百七十二元、此因外滙放長、金價平靜、人心尙安靜、族因謠風突生、謂海防運輸可通、由此搶帽子輩蜂擁而來、一致撈進、市况漸漸上升至九百九十四元、此刻有一部份浮多吐出、再行下降至九百八十八元收盤、查　日間成交統計二千九百三十五包、行情雙馬漲十八元、永安廠開出二十支特金城七百包、價爲九百五十元、一禮拜出淸、茲將各幫口買去之額量分別如左</p>
<p>同行　二、三七五　香港五三五</p>

<p>巴西棉交易活</p>
<p>現棉交易、仍屬平淡、廠方仍無極大需要、惟申新屬略有納胃、亦不過點綴而已、所以行情乏變化也、</p>
<p>彭家浦　二一〇·〇〇　申新進　二〇〇件</p>
<p>火機花　一五四·五〇　同行進　二四〇包</p>
<p>大中集　二〇五·〇〇　又　二〇九·〇〇　又　一三〇包</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因賣戶之缺乏、後因華爾街股票價格之轉好、及一部同業之購買、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲二三磅音、印度昨日連同預測漲二羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來頗形活躍、市上存底日少、且搜購長纖維之原棉頗烈、故巴西棉之交易、甚爲活躍、奈因市上存貨對於長纖維者更缺、凡同業中藏有該項原棉、目前尙不願售出云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉市去路已通　缺擋貨價見漲</h3>
<p>國布　昨市趨勢稍堅蓋以越港舫運可通、滬寗沿綫貨運亦見增加、滬貨出路略轉活絡、人心看穩市盤呹勢已戰、一部份缺檔各貨每疋漲二角半之譜、本街成交坯布五百餘件、夸港幫辦漂染印花布斜紋粗布二百件、浙閩幫零星添辦續有成交、滇幫辦藍布等二百件、國外新加坡暹邏各地辦色布色斜漂布四千餘疋、北路烟津幫辦粗布絨布綫呢等貨一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　昨北路烟台幫採辦彩球等細布三四百包、本街染銷以時令關係、中下檔細布實需漸旺、市氣轉緊、龍頭細布因市塲開放後市交易、成交尤鉅下午收盤爲三十二元七角半、四君子嗶嘰九角三分六二五、</p>
<h3>油市　生油復漲　說是花生遭水災</h3>
<p>豆油及花生油市况、因傳產地花生被水浸影響、油價報漲、故有一部份貨主在暗中抵進、致人心又抱樂觀態度、市塲中頓見進多出少、行情復緊半元至一元半、統計成交膠州現生油三十件、價爲六十四元、訂九月上半交至十月下半月交、共一千一百五十餘件、價爲六十二元、至六十三元、烟台現生油一百件、價爲六十二元五角、靑島生油二百三十桶、價爲八十九元五角至八十八元五角、訂九月下半月交至十月上半月交一百七十桶、價爲八十八元五角至八十七元五角、及膠州豆油五十件、價爲六十九元、靑歧豆油五十件、價爲七十元、烟歧豆油一百件、價爲七十元、大連豆油八十桶、價爲九十八元五角至九十七元、大有餘廠二百担、價爲七十六元五角至七十五元云、</p>
<p>又豆子三百五十包、今日運往天津、</p>
<h3>糖市　刁青漲一元</h3>
<p>昨糖市平平、交易較稀、公會割盤、現貨二四粗白外棧新貨七十七元半、三月份老貨七十六元、太古車白B嘜稍緊爲七十七元、DY嘜九月份打棧單者爲七十三半、荷赤九月十七日到貨六十三元、國糖刁靑積見上展、建幫開出一百三十一包、價爲六十六元、漲起一元、聞產價亦緊、暫時乏到、後市或須再聚云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　海南圓肉看升</h3>
<p>海南圓肉、見新後以到貨較旺、號盤一再見降、較首市前後跌去白分之三十五强、前據客方函訊、產價轉緊、或有回升一二十元之望、故今日號方勢必回升云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煙煤屑去路狹</h3>
<p>烟煤屑各貨、邇來因本市各廠大多停工、老虎灶浴室、又有平價煤屑供給、本街門莊、益形淸淡、行情自難生色、計做開平二號屑每噸一百二十五元、基隆屑一百十元、烟煤屑一百十二元、以上均同業行拆、送到客戶、酌加行槓、</p>
<h3>絲茶　茶市紅堅綠靜</h3>
<p>昨日土莊紅萊、錦隆好士門等行、仍在繼續搜辦、但因原料存底枯薄供不應求、市勢轉挺、至綠茶市况、不振如故、美莊去路、仍在斷續之間、全市祗共成交紅綠茶二百六十餘箱、紅茶售價二百八十五元、蝦目二百七十元、紅茶似較綠茶爲佳云、前昨五金交易、因受雨阻、損失不少、蓋烟台幫所辦之本廠釘、及其他鐵品、均因終日秋雨不克出貨、此外本街所點級之貨品、亦未見上車、查洋釘市况、最初頗感凋零、近一二日來因烟臺　有搜羅、故市象逐見換新、行情亦步見高、刻每桶倍司喊四十八元、聞前昨成交數在六七百桶之譜、因之新盤兀市情、亦繼長增高、前昨由某某等製釘廠相率搜進甚夥、因預料秋凉後生意必然發動故也、雖本釘滬存甚衆、但一且實銷暢達後、仍難免有供不應求之象、故趁此機會吸收原料、致新盤元市價亦高至五十元左右一擔耳、</p>
<h3>藥材　丁香市平</h3>
<p>丁香邇來陸續有到、漸呈供過於求之象、查前市開過四百二十元、號方後到之貨、雖叫原價、各行觀望少進、昨聞還小十元、尙未成交云、</p>
<h3>針織品　衛生衫褲新盤</h3>
<p>時値中秋、衛生衫褲業已上市、客幫已有採辦、惟今庚行情、因原料加重、及製工增加、故其售盤較之客秋亦增加有四五成之鉅、如五和廠出品之中式羅袖色男衫（三二〇）號、每打前售二三十元左右者、今秋售五十四元半、其他振豐廠之吉字（二〇〇）自由領男衫、前售每打二十四五元、現售色衫五十四元半、全白者售五十七元、其棉毛衫褲及羢手套等、售價亦莫不增漲、</p>

<h3>城門啓閉</h3>
<p>欽加布政使銜江南分巡蘇松太兵備劉，爲出示曉諭事：查上海爲五方雜處，商賈輻輳之區，奸宄最易混跡，各城門爲防衛地方面設，啟閉本有定時；惟華洋交涉，每有深夜出入之事，故各衙門設有對牌，卽委員遇有公幹，亦准請給照會開城。現因地方不靖，允宜嚴密查察，嗣後各城門務須按時啟閉，除對牌照會外，一概不得放行。如有外來緊要公文，不及待至次日者，由城鬥員弁派人伴送，以昭愼重。除移提右營轉飭各城門汎弁遵辦，並飭各委員隨時嚴密稽察外，合行出示曉諭，爲此示仰軍民人等，一體遵照，毋違特示！</p>

<p>逸聞</p>
<h3>邱吉爾與雪茄烟</h3>
<p>— 蕭雲</p>
<p>八月三十日，合衆社在西報上發表了　段短短的歐戰珍聞，說英國首相邱吉爾在前一天巡視英國南岸飛機塲時，碰巧德機來襲，邱吉爾在要進防空壕的時候，照例燃點慣常所吸的大雪茄烟。當地的市長看見了，速忙上前阻止，說「先生，這裏是禁止吸烟的。」</p>
<p>「好吧，』邱吉爾回答着，把雪茄烟躡在脚下，隨口輕輕地說，「損失了一根好烟。」</p>
<p>這雖然是一件無關緊要的小事，可是却有不少的含義與敎訓。這個故事表現了英國人的奉公守法的精神。雖然是大官要人，也能很謙虛地服從公衆的禁律，並不因爲勸阻者地位比自己低而起輕蔑之心，也不因下屬的面責而老羞成怒。</p>
<p>這種奉公守法的精神雖是理所當然，却是需要相當的修養與幽默感才辦得到的。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>往事</h3>
<p>— 煥鈞</p>
<p>家在生活的重擔壓榨下，速六十多歲白髮蒼蒼的父親也得整天出外去工作，不讓他養息幾年，這使我做兒子的眞有寢食不安之感了。</p>
<p>每天晚上，父親蹣跚地歸來，慈祥的臉上，皺紋像一天天在加深；當他拖着沉重的脚步踱過我面前，瞧他灣曲的背影，更較前衰老得多，不禁長長地嘆一口氣，我的心碎了</p>
<p>父親的職業確是淸高而艱苦，每天拔直着喉嚨力竭聲嘶的嚷，漲紅了的臉上暴露着靑筋，而所得的酬報眞菲薄極了。可是他幷不灰心，也不叫苦，好像他是爲敎育而生存的。</p>
<p>深夜，人們早已安逸地去追溫好夢，惟有父親却不能去睡，他要替學生們批改作文卷，隨便做什麼事父親都肯馬虎，可是逢到批改作文，他就決不含糊，快些的一小時改二三木，逢到文字拙劣不通的，小時改不了一本，這就苦了他老人家，一年到頭難得睡幾會早覺。有時一覺醒來，父親還枯坐在孤燈下工作着，我實在看不過了，不由得說上幾句話：「父親！你也該省些力了，隨便改一下不是快得多嗎？日後學生們有發達的一天，不見得會想起你老人家的好處來。」</p>
<p>「我倒幷不這樣忖，我當了三十多年敎員，從未有過一天的溺職，好像敎育是我的第二生命，除非我是死了，那就什麼也得放棄；否則，我存在一天，就多盡一天的職任。」</p>
<p>父親的話誰也得表贊同，可是我不忍他老人家老是這樣做去。</p>
<p>一是的，父親！我們應該這樣做……可是你已衰老了，不能像靑年人一樣的幹，你也得顧到自己的身子。」</p>
<p>父親的臉色却沒有絲毫的改動，他還是用堅決的語氣說：「誠然，我很覺得體力是衰老了，精神也遠不如前，多坐了週身會得酸痛；但我還得撑住幾根老骨，縱然耗盡精力也在所不惜，我決不能出賣自己的良心去幹着貽誤人家子弟的事。」</p>
<p>他說完了話，繼續埋頭工作，像要絞盡所有的腦汁來把學生們的作文批改得詳盡週到一點，差不多連一字一句都得用上一番思攷，決不肯輕輕地放過。</p>
<p>我瞧他老人家這副形景，又望望桌上那一厚疊文卷，一陣心酸，禁不住蒙被而哭了。</p>
<p>父親敎了三十幾年書，學生至少也有二三千。現在父親死去了六年，那些受過他敎誨的人，有誰還能記着曾在昔年愛過自己的慈祥盡職的老師來呢？</p>
<p>戰爭</p>
<h3>新聞兵</h3>
<p>— 史談</p>
<p>閱讀德國的戰爭報吿，不論是那一張照片或是那一件紀事，下面老有P．K署名着；道是甚麼意義呢？我想知道的人恐怕很少吧，實在那就是「宜傳部隊一的縮寫。</p>
<p>自從此次歐戰爆發以來，簽着P．K署名的戰綫報吿陸續地送回德國，對於德國國民，這便成了唯一戰地寫實的象徵，爲什麼呢？因爲是P．K署名的報告文，決不是書桌上的作品，同時祇要有P．K二字印着的照片，也決不是從照相簿中檢出來的僞品，P．K的作品是在戰爭之中所產生的，寫作這新聞的本人，旣不是現像過去一般的記者，又非攝影記者，他們跟在戰塲戰鬥中的戰友一樣是一個士兵，稱他為新聞兵也無不可。</p>
<p>這些「新聞兵」的任務，是要使在後方勤勞的農夫，主婦，敎師，勞働者，薪給階級等，直接而又具體地明瞭他們的兒子或兄弟是怎樣的在困難中奮鬥着，而獲得他們的同感，以致完成國家的總力戰。因此P．K的隊員都如此感覺到負有上述的重任。</p>
<p>在每一戰鬥部隊之中，必配屬着若干名宣傳部隊的隊員，就是在海軍裏面，任何一艘小的潛水艇中，也有宣傳部隊的隊員搭乘着。他們存在在以驚異的機械化的速度，進襲巴黎的部隊之中，他們也與突破堅固的柳奇要塞重砲隊一致行動，他們也潛伏在襲擊英國軍港的潛水艇中，他們也搭乘在轟炸倫敦和法達斯的飛機中，冒着追擊機和高射砲的危險，視察戰鬥的模樣，將自己國家兵士們的體騐傳佈給後方和民衆；這種工作，與從來報館的從軍記者片刻的戰綫訪問，在性質上是完全相異的。縱使來到戰綫，新聞記者是照例在司令部的書桌之上，背着溫暖的火爐，幻想地製成那些事物，德國P．K隊員的工作，實是不能和他們同日而語的。</p>
<p>今日德國的宣傳部隊，在本質上，他們是一羣士兵；他們已不如過去的戰地通信員一般，做一個報社或出版社的僱員，旣不爲僱主而勞働，父不受僱主的報酬，他們是爲國家而勞働着，他們寫文章，攝照相都不爲了金錢，他們純然是士兵，所以他們的作品，不是提供報館或出版社而是送給中央事務局，中央事務局再區別出各種材料的性質，分配給研究機關或是作正當的宜傳，同時也送給中立國的報紙和政府當局。</p>
<p>P．K隊員的出身，幾全部是有軍籍的記者，和新聞攝影記者，從他們的專門才能上看來，他們對於所負的使命，當然一定能駕輕就熟了。</p>
<h3>植物的傳染病</h3>
<p>— 化時</p>
<p>有一種植物，如馬鈴薯，烟草等常發生一種明顯的病症，葉上有粽色白色的斑點好似圖案畫，這種病叫作「摩沙衣革」（Mosaic）是有傳染性的。有人將一個有病的嫩芽移接在另一顆植物上，那一顆也染到同樣的病症，將有病植物中的液汁榨取出來，使之沾到別的植物上，經過六天到十五天的潛伏期後，這植物也染到病症，有人說這是一種細菌病，但找不到有機微生物，有病植物的液汁經澄淸後，仍不失毒性。</p>
<p>美人　湯來經過四年的努力，在有病的植物中發現一種液體，性如蛋白質，能變成結晶體，於是人們知道這不是有生命的機體，在一株烟草中，八十萬分之一克的這種液體，，幾天後也染上這病了，而且能無止盡地傳染到別的植物上</p>
<p>在今日，有人以爲植物的傳染病是由於一種發酵性的物質）但多數人說是微菌的作用，若是利用熱或是防腐劑（如氣化劑的力量），可以將這種病源消滅，這成了生物與非生物的難分的界限，很値得生物學家，醫學家，細菌學家們操</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第六章　危險的經歷</p>
<p>霍桑把一條右腿擱在他的左膝上，身子靠着椅背，又吐出了一口烟，方才說話。他緩綏說道：「我的經歷，如果要加上什麼考語，那可以說又險，又巧，又失敗。」</p>
<p>我不耐地說：「你不要沒頭沒腦，晚得淸楚些。」</p>
<p>倪金壽也在那裏暗暗點頭，分明對於我斥責霍桑的話表示極端的同意。</p>
<p>霍桑微微笑了一笑，就開始說：「好，我就有頭有　地說。當你跟着余甘棠追進電梯以後，我仍繼續和金壽兄接談，約有兩三分鐘，這亂子便發生了－包朗，這件事你也要負些兒責任。你爲着要聽我的談話，不是把電話間的玻璃鬥開着嗎？因此，我的談話聲音才傳到外面。我在無意中忽瞧見一個人，在那甬道中突然把身子一蹲，迅速地把右手舉近他的胸口包朗，你總知道這是開手槍最準確的姿勢啊。——」</p>
<p>倪金壽着急地問道：「那末，你看見他開槍的嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑搖搖頭。「不，我祇看見那人這一種姿勢。我急忙把兩膝一　，身子直向下蹲，乒乓一聲，槍彈已穿玻璃進來。我手中的電話筒也當然脫手。那槍聲祇有一響，他大概料想我已被打中。其實他的瞄準要是低半吋，或是我那時的動作遲緩半秒鐘，大概我此刻也要到那個不大有趣的地點去，陪着那位舞后等候白醫官了！」</p>
<p>我瞧見倪金壽一眼不霎地瞧着霍桑。他臉上的肌肉好像都貫串着鐵絲。我自己雖沒有鏡子，神情上也一定和倪金壽相差不遠。但霍桑却仍安閒如常，好像他講的話，並不是他自己的經歷，祇是什麼「齊東野語」式的故事。我催促着說：「你瞧見那開槍的人嗎？誰？」</p>
<p>霍桑又吐出一長條烟絲。「別心急哪。這就是險。現在說到巧了。這巧字上又分兩點；第一，那開槍的人也是在無意中遇見的。包朗，你可記得我們在亞東七樓跟那個七十一號茶房談話時，有僩戴眼鏡大模大樣官僚典型的傢伙，從甬道東端走近我們嗎？」</p>
<p>我應道：「很淸楚。那傢伙個子很高，穿一件深藍色的長袍，戴一頂棕色的呢帽，嘴脣上還有些短鬚。」（九五）</p>

<h3>孤島劇話</h3>
<p>— 唯唯</p>
<p>蓋叫天老當益壯</p>
<p>譚富英，陳麗芳期滿後，更新舞台邀聘名伶蓋叫天·沈曼華出演，於上月二十九日登台，記者曾往一觀，抵院時，台上正演「捉放曹」，飾陳宮者爲高醒菴，實即前次出演天蟾之高警民，滿身羊氣，嗓復不濟，故無精彩可言。「捉放曹」後，爲沈曼華之「玉堂春」，沈係名伶姜妙香之得意弟子，來自故都，藝頗不弱，以大體而論，曼華之藝，實在張君秋。陳麗芳輩之上。惟曼華係</p>
<p>正工青衣</p>
<p>能戲或無君秋麗芳之多。但自陳德霖·吳彩霞後，梨園中已鮮見正工靑衣人才，　沈曼華之正工靑衣，亦可謂鳳毛麟角，是日所演之「玉堂春」唱唸俱佳，腔悉宗梅，蓋曼華嘗得蘭芳之指點也。唱「大人哪」之「回龍腔」時，曼華一手扶地，有一美妙身段，爲他伶所無。會審完畢，蘇三起立時，手扶兩腿做酸痛狀，則嫌過火，以意度之，曼華或許能唱不能做，但其身上則不難看也。大軸爲蓋叫天之「惡虎村」，近年蓋五演劇，每因缺乏良配，而有</p>
<p>光桿牡丹之憾。此次更新邀蓋出演，自共舞台借來花面王福勝，卡爾登借來開口跳許幼田，此一人皆善演武戲者，是日一飾武天虬，一飾王樑，極盡牡丹綠葉之妙，爲全劇生色不少。蓋叫天老當益壯，手脚敏捷如昔，全劇精彩百出，最引人人勝者爲：（一）出惡虎村拉馬回店之一小圓塲，身上與鑼鼓點子恰合，煞是好看；（二）走邊一塲唸「仁義禮智信爲高」四句時，先用「落地十三」，接連兩個「飛脚」，乾凈俐落，妙到秋毫；（三）開打時奪刀一塲，與其下靶對打，絲絲人扣，可謂</p>
<p>天衣無縫</p>
<p>此外如「跌鸞帶」「亮鞋底」以及上下塲之「亮相」，無小佳妙，今人觀劇，每喜以「京派」「海派」做根據，及見蓋叫天可不必再作京海之分，蓋今日故都之武生中，能藝如蓋叫天者，實不可得，蓋叫天眞替江南伶人揚眉吐氣矣。</p>
<h3>「生死戀」觀感</h3>
<p>— 慕陶</p>
<p>李霞卿客串飛行家</p>
<p>在惟利是圖的好萊塢各公司，往往依藉了特別時機來拍成某種影片，以求取得生意經上的目的。像這張「生死戀」，它是利用了一個生長在中國而入中國籍的美國女子與外國男子戀愛的故事，挿入了一個頑固的醫學敎投，再利用了些中國抗戰的時機來形成的。在內容上旣無美妙之處，而於意義上又缺乏正義感，所以本片的價値，也就不如理想的高超了</p>
<p>雖然，本片的技術頗小弱。導演是「生死同心」，一碧玉春夢」，等片的弗蘭克鮑才琪，他的手腕輕快而有力，流利而深刻，能給人以不可磨滅的印象。是以本片一半的成績，須歸功於導演的。片中最精彩的地方是幾個開刀塲面，導演利用了各人面部的表情，音響時鐘以及輸血的鏡頭，來加强空氣的緊張，可稍成功。其他如介紹安德烈出塲，描寫福士脫醫師生性的苛刻，以及安德烈及的翰羅曼史的進行，亦都有美妙的手法。不過片末約翰在中國受彈重傷的塲面因爲地時關係，已被剪去，所以在約翰救一位中國難童後，就接上了福士脫醫師接到的翰受傷信件的塲面，那就不免使觀衆有些不懂，同時也削弱了最後高潮的力量。</p>
<p>陶樂娜拉摩飾中國籍女子安德烈，戲不多，然頗合個性。她講了五六句中國話，尙還可聽，但是總有點洋腔，不大入耳。所穿的幾套中國服裝，亦與今日我國摩登女郞的旗袍，大有出入。亞金泰密洛夫飾福士脫醫師，演技老練，可稱成功。約翰霍華飾約翰，戲雖稱職，然缺乏面部表情，並無美妙成績。</p>
<p>在本片中客串的中國女飛行家李霞卿亦飾女飛機師，祇有一個鏡頭，祗說了一句中國話。正片前的一張音樂短片中有美國名歌星萊斯連斯達爾等唱流行歌曲，非常動聽，値得一看。</p>
<h3>「實驗」音樂會</h3>
<p>— 談復</p>
<p>實騐音樂社的第三第四次音樂會將在五·六兩日晚九時假座八仙橋靑年會舉行。這次參加演出的合唱隊大概有四五十人之多，唱的有農婦曲，祖國曲，鍊鐵，春之消息等七個國家的作品二十餘首，指揮是陳歌辛君。除了合唱節目以外，還有管絃樂的合奏和伴奏，小提琴獨奏，男低音和女高音的獨唱。</p>
<p>這兩次音樂會的節目是排得兩樣的；有幾首歌被重唱，有些只能聽到一次。船長歌，農婦曲，火犁行進曲，祖國進行曲，黃金色的浮雲，牧羊女的歌，螢，搖籃曲等都是只出現一次，而且據說這次以後，節目要完全換上新的。</p>
<p>上海音樂界頗形寂寞，「實音」此舉，當然是不能不爲之介紹於每一個音樂愛好者之前的。</p>

<h3>舊金山華僑　新建電臺</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>舊金山的美國居民，近來每在收聽無綫電播音的時候，常常收到一種奇異的歌唱音樂和演說。他們對於這些節目都不能聽懂，大家都在猜測着這種異調的廣播聲。</p>
<p>原來在舊金山的華僑，已建築了一座廣播電台，呼號是KSAN，每晚廣播各種節目，據該台節目管理主任董君（Mr－Sam　S．S．Tong）談，中美兩國商人，對該台廣播節目，已引起了極大的興趣，過去成績已是十分圓滿。</p>
<p>現在僑居於舊金山的二萬華僑，和在加利福尼亞的中部數千僑胞，都是很樂於收聽。此外，洛杉磯，鹹湖城，芝加哥及東美沿海各地的僑胞，亦都可以收聆這些中國音樂和演說，以稍紓他們對祖國的懷念之殷。</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to military sources, the Chinese troops' positions along the Zhengtai Railway line are being consolidated daily. The section of the railway from Jingxing westward to Lujiazhuang is entirely under Chinese control. Only the isolated area of Yangquan remains, where a small number of Japanese troops are desperately holding out. The Japanese troops occupying Shouxian suffered heavy losses after Chinese troops infiltrated the city. The Japanese attempted to send reinforcements from Shijiazhuang and Yuci separately, but they were intercepted by Chinese forces. Both sides are currently engaged in fierce battles in the areas of Weishui, east of Jingxing, and the area of Duanting, west of Lujiazhuang. (Havas Agency dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Well-informed Chinese sources recently stated that the Eighth Route Army units have been firmly blockading the four major railways in North China since the middle of last week, preventing the Japanese army from reinforcing and counterattacking. Intense fighting is still ongoing east of Niangziguan and Jingjing.

Chinese troops are attacking from the north to the south, while Japanese troops are withdrawing southward along the Lixi and Nanhuai Rivers.

According to war dispatches, the situation in Longzhou is extremely chaotic, as Japanese troops are burning houses and removing all obstacles to prevent a Chinese siege. It is also reported that Chinese troops are approaching Longzhou from all directions.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Rumor of France Ceding All Colonies</h3>
<p>Yesterday there was a dispatch, said to be from London, stating that all French colonies had been ceded to Germany; the Pétain government had signed a secret treaty of this cession with Germany, in exchange for Germany's support of the Pétain regime; this was the result of France's being threatened, and was a vigorous promotion of a return to agriculture, reducing itself to an agricultural nation, and becoming a vassal of German industrialization; thereafter there would be no more industrial products to exchange with the raw materials of various colonies, and the colonies would become superfluous, and so on. This is a shocking dispatch.</p>
<p>France stopped resisting, admitted defeat, declared its surrender to Germany and Italy, and signed armistice agreements one after another. Whether it can continue to maintain all or part of its colonies has become a question. Assuming that it eventually cedes all of them, this is of course extremely painful for France and France's friends, but it is not an extraordinary surprise; even at the beginning of the surrender, it is not difficult to imagine that such pain may be unavoidable. In the armistice agreement, France was allowed to retain the armament of the warships it needed to maintain its overseas colonies; the significance of this does not guarantee that the peace agreement conditions will not require France to cede colonies. Now is precisely the effective period of the armistice agreement, and the peace treaty has not yet been negotiated; therefore, whether the cession of colonies should be an important part of the peace agreement is also not yet certain, unless there is, as the dispatch from yesterday said, a so-called secret agreement between France and Germany. Assuming that there is indeed such a secret agreement, then during the "secret" period of the secret agreement, France may avoid the serious international impact that could be caused by the transfer issue because the French colonies are ostensibly maintained. Only because the cession and transfer of colonies cannot be carried out in secret like other political, military, and economic issues, it will eventually be made public. On the day of the public announcement, Germany will use the French colonies as a base for multilateral contact with the international community; the international situation at that time is truly difficult to imagine at present.</p>
<p>Whether there is a secret agreement between Germany and France to cede all colonies is naturally impossible for outsiders to determine; but based on the general situation at present, it is better to disbelieve this news. One reason is that it seems a very unusual move for the two countries to conclude any important secret agreement during the transitional period between armistice and not yet peace. The second reason is that Germany's current urgent task is not to seize overseas resources from France first, but to strive for the overall victory of the war. The third reason is that although France has declared its surrender, all its determinations must still shift depending on the extent of the victory or defeat in the Anglo-German war, and there is currently no need to sign this secret agreement with Germany first. The fourth reason is that the so-called French colonies, assuming that a cession issue occurs, then Germany, after gaining overall victory, although has great power of speech, on one hand must take into account Italy, which is fighting together, and on the other hand must take into account the Monroe Doctrine of the United States and the joint declaration of the American countries because of the French colonies in the Americas. The fifth reason is that although colonies are related to industrialism, it does not mean that agricultural countries do not need colonies; therefore, France's advocacy of returning to agriculture today cannot be used as a counter-argument that France is determined to abandon its colonies; moreover, returning to agriculture and emphasizing industry are only relative distinctions. It would be tantamount to obliterating the nature and instinct of natural evolution to say that France or any country in the future is a purely agricultural country. Also, the large-scale measures taken by General Pétain after assuming office this time can indeed be criticized from various perspectives; the thing called "political power," even if it is tempting, often leads people astray, even to depravity; but judging from General Pétain's personality from the past to the present, he is resolute and taciturn, definitely not a glib, selfish, self-serving, power-grabbing, and opportunistic person; therefore, to say that he signed a secret agreement to cede all colonies in exchange for guaranteeing political power, we at least cannot believe it of General Pétain: moreover, the fate of political power, especially political power centered on individuals, its main foundation lies in whether it has the support of the nation and whether it is sound itself. If it fails to obtain national understanding and lightly signs a secret agreement, cutting off territories, to exchange for the support of a foreign country, then its political power foundation is like on a beach, and will be swept away by every wave and will have no guarantee at all. How could General Pétain do this.</p>
<p>In short, after France's armistice and surrender, its colonies and everything else at least have the danger of problems occurring; and it is expected that Germany will definitely gain something after determining its victory; but to say that Germany and France have signed a secret agreement as yesterday's dispatch said, is bizarre and cannot be immediately believed.</p>
<h3>US Navy Secretary to Depart Tomorrow, Inspect Pacific Defenses, to Review US Naval Exercises, First Batch of National Guard Conscripts to Receive Training</h3>
<p>Washington: The Navy Department announced last night that Navy Secretary Colonel Knox will depart by plane this Wednesday to personally inspect US Pacific defenses.

<p>Roosevelt Special Train: President Roosevelt yesterday issued a historic order to conscript 65,000 members of the National Guard, starting September 16th, for one year of active training to supplement the manpower of the nation's new defense structure. The President's move is based on the National Guard Enlistment Act signed last Tuesday, which authorizes the President to send the National Guard to any location in the United States, including the Philippines, for one year of military training. However, the President has not yet indicated that the National Guard will be transferred outside of the continental United States. The President also stated yesterday that the strength of the National Guard will immediately increase to 76,000. The President said that the remaining 15,500 members of the National Guard will be recruited from the public soon. National Guardsmen who are married or have obligations to support relatives can be exempted from military service within a few days, and the vacated positions will be filled by newly recruited personnel. Army officials have completed all preparations to accommodate the 60,000 National Guardsmen about to report for training. It is believed that they can not only accommodate them, but also arm and supply another one million men. This one million men can be conscripted once Congress passes the "Burke-Wadsworth" Enlistment Act. It is understood that the bill is expected to be passed by Congress this week.

<p>US Congress to Adjourn in Early October, Defense Procedures to Be Completed Early</p>
<p>New York: This morning's newspapers all carried the news of Roosevelt's call-up of the first batch of 60,000 National Guardsmen for one year of training in large print, emphasizing the unprecedented nature of this move in peacetime. Washington dispatches hinted that Congress would complete defense procedures early so that it could adjourn in early October. The conscription bill is expected to be ready in about two weeks and signed by President Roosevelt. Although it was reported that isolationist leader Nye said in a radio debate that the United States' sale of overage destroyers to Britain would be an act of a belligerent nation, today's newspapers again prominently featured a speech by Columbia University President Butler, urging the United States to lead the fight for world freedom. According to a Los Angeles dispatch in the New York Times, General Vorian, who recently returned from Japan, urged the United States to join the war before visiting reporters, arguing that the United States should send pilots, aircraft, and smaller warships to Britain.

<p>Roosevelt Special Train: President Roosevelt issued an order last night to mobilize 60,500 members of the US National Guard from New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Missouri, and various southwestern states to begin military service for one year from September 16th. Roosevelt left Washington yesterday by train for Chattanooga, Tennessee, where he will deliver several Labor Day speeches today. According to Roosevelt's new order, all active and non-active members of the National Guard must report to designated camps. It is estimated that four divisions will report, including active and non-active military personnel. These four divisions will be divided into several teams, each with different responsibilities, mostly eight harbor defense teams, seven anti-aircraft artillery teams, three coastal artillery teams, and four reconnaissance teams. It is reported that the order was formally signed by the President at Hyde Park last Saturday. (International News Service dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Anglo-American Negotiations Proceed Smoothly, US-Australia Joint Defense May Be Realized</p>
<p>Washington: Last night, it was predicted here that an agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom would inevitably be reached, allowing the United States unlimited use of British territories in the Western Hemisphere and the right to establish naval and air bases. Officials said that an announcement regarding this matter could be made at any time. It is said that Anglo-American negotiations are proceeding smoothly and very satisfactorily. It is said that the US's permission to use the British Bermuda Islands is one of the results of the negotiations. President Roosevelt stopped here last night on his way from Hyde Park, New York, to Chattanooga, Tennessee, in a special train, and had a two-hour conversation with Secretary of State Hull, which is said to be related to Anglo-American negotiations. This makes it more believable that Anglo-American negotiations have reached the final stage. It is believed that the recently concluded US-Canada joint defense agreement will promote a movement to establish strong naval and air bases in the British territories in the Western Hemisphere, which will not only guarantee the safety of the Panama Canal, but also be combined with the US defense forces' bases along the Canadian and Atlantic and Pacific coasts of South America. Last night, certain parties believed that the results of the negotiations between Britain and the United States on allowing the United States to use its territories in the Western Hemisphere will promote the realization of US-Australia joint defense, and said that Congress has now begun to advocate the establishment of a US-Australia joint defense agreement of the same nature as the US-Canada joint defense. Although there is a tendency for the executive branch to favor this movement, the proposal has not yet been submitted. The reason for not submitting it is only because the negotiations between Britain and the United States on territories in the Western Hemisphere have not yet concluded.

<h3>US and Canada: Content of Negotiations: Six Points According to Swedish Newspaper</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital: Stockholm's "Dagens Nyheter"'s London correspondent reports that there are six points in the former negotiations between the US and Canada: (1) The United States establishes naval and air bases in Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick, which are jointly constructed and garrisoned by the US and Canada. (2) The US Navy patrols the Canadian coast. (3) The two countries should jointly plan and exchange information on the military situation. (4) Eliminate all restrictions on the transportation of raw materials and war materials from the US to Canada. (5) Transfer US-style destroyers to Canada to compensate for the British bases it obtained in the Caribbean. (6) Restore the plan to transfer safe transportation routes to the United States, so that US military transportation can pass through British Columbia to Alaska. According to the newspaper's opinion, Britain can be free from defending Canada, and can transfer the Canadian warships and troops to other parts of the British Empire, and can send the US warships obtained by Canada to Britain.

<h3>American Newspapers Recount War Situation, Believe British Hopes Are Higher, Praise British Bravery</h3>
<p>New York. American newspapers mostly recount the war situation of the past year. General public opinion believes that British hopes are higher. The New York Herald Tribune stated that a year of war has shaken Hitler's victory. The New York Times stated that today's British resistance will prove the fallacy of Hitler's belief that he can conquer Europe and dominate the world. The New York Times' Berlin dispatch stated that last winter already felt difficult, and if Britain still does not succumb this winter, then Germany will be greatly disappointed. The New York Daily News translated a full page describing Hitler's secret weapons, saying they are small boats driven by remote control, carrying explosives with destructive power equivalent to twelve torpedoes.

<h3>American Party Members Unite to Oppose Conscription Bill</h3>
<p>Washington. News emerged today that Missouri Republican Congressman Short is currently uniting some members of the Republican and Democratic parties to oppose the conscription bill while it is being sent back to the Senate for a final vote and before it becomes law. People in Congress revealed their strategy, saying that during the debate, they will raise a point, namely that the bill will "plunge the United States into a war against totalitarian countries." Short said that high pressure is currently forcing people to give up this idea, but also said, "I fear the government will eventually be able to pass it." (2nd, International News Service)</p>
<h3>US Aircraft Production to Double, Defense Industry Advancing Rapidly</h3>

About ten new factories are under construction, and the number of workers employed by industry has increased rapidly. By the end of 1940, aircraft production will increase by 50 percent. Last week, the amount of raw materials necessary for national defense that were stockpiled increased greatly. Currently, 180,000 tons of rubber have been added, bringing the total to 416,000 tons. Other military raw materials are also being imported steadily. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japan Will Postpone Appointing Ambassador to the United States, Horiuchi to Leave Washington Soon</h3>
<p>Washington. Authoritative sources understand that the post of Japanese Ambassador to the United States will be temporarily vacant until after the US election in November, and then a decision will be made. Reliable sources say that the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Horiuchi, will soon leave because the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is adjusting its foreign envoys. An authoritative source also said that Japan's southward policy has been delayed due to the increasingly tough attitude of the United States and the ban on exports. The uncertain outcome of the European war and Italy's incompetence are important reasons for Japan's indecision. It is heard that Japan did not anticipate Britain's strength, so the enthusiasm of the generally more intelligent people for the Axis countries has now diminished somewhat.

<h3>Japanese Newspapers Again Advocate Exclusive Control of Dutch East Indies Resources, Before Arrival of Japanese Economic Delegation, US-Dutch Negotiations Proceed</h3>
<p>Tokyo. A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Kobayashi's visit to the Netherlands has no specific plan. Future negotiations, such as concluding tariff agreements or commercial treaties, will depend on the attitude of the Dutch authorities. (2nd, United Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Today, the Nichinichi Shimbun published an article on the occasion of Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi being appointed as a special envoy to the Dutch East Indies, warning Kobayashi to be wary of the "cunning" of the Dutch. The newspaper carried a special commentary from its Batavia correspondent, which warned that Kobayashi's visit to the Dutch East Indies would certainly be warmly welcomed by the Dutch authorities, but the Dutch authorities would inevitably use cunning means to avoid concluding any agreement that would satisfy Japan. The article also stated that there are more British people than Dutch people in the Dutch East Indies, and they are very hostile to the Japanese. The Dutch East Indies has already concluded various secret agreements with British colonies, and many British military officers have joined the Dutch East Indies army. For example, the landing of 600 British troops in Soembang (transliteration) on the northeast coast of Java in August is an example. The correspondent also stated that the Dutch are also trying to increase friendship with the United States. American journalists traveling in the Dutch East Indies are treated as guests of the state, and they are especially allowed to travel throughout the Dutch East Indies, but this is not the case for Japanese journalists. Japanese journalists are closely watched, as if they were spies, and are not allowed to telegraph to Japan the text published in Dutch East Indies newspapers. The correspondent's commentary urged Kobayashi not to be fooled by the "cunning" of the Dutch, and not to be satisfied with the Dutch East Indies' minor concessions regarding Japan's demands. If he compromises with the Dutch, Japan will gain nothing. The Dutch East Indies is extremely rich in all the natural resources that Japan needs today and in the future. Therefore, Japan has no reason to allow any other country to develop or retain these resources. (2nd, United Press)</p>
<p>London. The Dutch authorities here are waiting for the arrival of a delegation from the American oil company.

<h3>Dutch Ambassador to the US Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA. Dr. Loudon, the Dutch Ambassador to the United States, was invited to speak at Harvard University. Because he was unable to attend the school in person, his entourage read his speech to the public, which stated that no matter what happens later, the Dutch overseas territories will not allow any party to provide undefended protection. This firm determination will not change in the slightest. It also stated that simple news reports from the Netherlands report that the country is broken, deaths are piled up, there are many suicides and killings. The Netherlands has become a tragic country. However, the information from Berlin, so-called Dutch official sources, and already checked letters, say the opposite. They say that the Netherlands has not suffered much damage, the number of deaths is not high, and the Dutch people are happy to cooperate with the behavior of the German leaders. We must know that the Dutch people cannot speak for themselves, and propaganda is the most powerful tool of the Nazis, so what they say cannot be lightly believed. In summary, the Netherlands will eventually rise up to regain what they cherish. (2nd, Reuters)</p>

<h3>German Planes Twice Attempt to Attack London Unsuccessfully, Berlin and Munich Suffer Air Raids, Germany Claims to Have Sunk Two British Warships</h3>
<p>London. Today's air raids by British and German forces were very intense. Multiple batches of German aircraft attempted to enter the center of London, but were driven back. British bombers heavily bombed Munich. The German authorities today admitted that British aircraft had carried out an unprecedented large-scale air raid over Munich, lasting a total of eighty minutes. However, they said that the attempts of the British aircraft to reach Berlin had all been repelled. British bombers also attacked multiple German airfields in France last night. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>A town in the Thames Estuary. This morning, British fighter planes and ground anti-aircraft guns twice repelled German aircraft attempting to attack London. At 9:00 AM today, two squadrons of German bombers, guarded by fast fighter planes, appeared over this town, attempting to break through the defenses and attack London. The first wave of attacks was repelled by terrifying anti-aircraft fire that lasted for ten minutes. Not long after this batch of aircraft left, a second wave of attackers, consisting of a total of forty bombers and fighter planes, flew to this place again, attempting to break through the air defenses again. Intense anti-aircraft fire was then fired again. Two aircraft were seen to fall to the ground with smoke. When the German aircraft approached the Thames River, multiple British fighter planes showed their prowess and fought with them. After five minutes of fierce fighting, the German aircraft suddenly retreated towards the sea. The clashes between British Spitfires and German fighter planes, and the attacks by Hurricanes on German bombers, all occurred after the anti-aircraft fire scattered the German aircraft formation. Neither of these two air raids dropped bombs. When the air battle approached the London area, London issued an air raid warning. The people of another town in the Thames River saw a German aircraft fall like a fire dragon this morning. When the aircraft was hit and the tail of the plane rotated over the town, about to fall, the crowd cheered with joy. (2nd, United Press)</p>
<p>Munich. Munich this morning tasted the taste of a long air raid alert amid intense anti-aircraft fire and machine gun fire. The alert began at 11:45 AM and was lifted at 2:05 PM.

These people still calmly went to their offices to work. (2nd, United Press)</p>
<p>London. Hitler launched an attack on London's strong defensive wall last night and this morning with a powerful air force. The explosion of German bombs shook the entire London area. On this anniversary of the tacit war, the city issued a total of three alerts. The three fierce attacks by German aircraft attempted to break a bloody path into the city of London. The Royal Air Force and anti-aircraft fire twice repelled the German aircraft formation, but a large group of Nazi aircraft was able to break through the defensive line of the capital and dropped bombs like rain in a certain area of the city. (2nd, United Press)</p>
<p>London. After a peaceful night, the London area issued its first air raid alert at 7:10 AM this morning, and the alert was lifted at 7:55 AM. According to the Ministry of Aviation, as of 1:00 PM today, British fighter planes had shot down nine German aircraft.

<p>Intense Air Battle in Southern England</p>
<p>London. This morning, a large number of German aircraft attacked. Intense air battles took place over southern England. According to the Ministry of Aviation, a total of eleven German aircraft were shot down by noon. Four British aircraft were missing, and the pilot of one of them had escaped safely. This afternoon, about two hundred German bombers and fighter planes flew in batches over the southeast coast. Anti-aircraft guns heavily bombarded them.

Londoners took shelter from German aircraft three times in one day. (2nd, International News Service)</p>
<p>British Air Force Heavily Attacks the Berlin Area</p>
<p>London. According to the Ministry of Aviation Intelligence Office, in the early morning of Sunday, British aircraft attacked Berlin and bombed important military targets. At that time, the visibility was poor, and the entire western area of Berlin was shrouded in low clouds. British pilots occasionally looked down through the gaps in the clouds and were able to determine their position after seeing a lake. Near midnight, a large aircraft engine factory northwest of Berlin was bombed. The places where the bombs landed flashed with light, and then caught fire. At the same time, other British aircraft attacked the power plant in the western part of the city. The flashes of high-explosive bombs falling in the target area were dazzling, and a large fire broke out that could be seen from thirty miles away. Other British aircraft were unable to detect targets in the Berlin area due to heavy cloud cover, so they flew to other places in Germany and the Netherlands to bomb the railway intersection in Hiltrup and the airfields in places such as Liesbüttel. The aircraft factory in Wiesling was also attacked by British heavy bombers, causing fires and explosions. British aircraft also bombed the Bayer gunpowder factory and ammunition loading factory near Cologne, but the cloud layer was low and the results of the battle could not be seen clearly. Airfields everywhere nearby were directly hit. The military factory in Spich was bombed, and fires broke out in several places. That night, British aircraft attacked the Emden shipyard in batches and continuously, dropping extremely large bombs. Although anti-aircraft fire was fierce and searchlights were dense, British aircraft were able to hit the target. According to one pilot, the number of British aircraft flying over Emden at the same time must have made the searchlight team panic. It was obvious that the searchlights could not hold any bomber for a long time to give the anti-aircraft gunners time to identify the target and bomb it. At that time, the ground in Emden was foggy, and the British aircraft's visibility was blocked, so they could not accurately see the results of the battle. The ground was obviously severely damaged. German long-range artillery positions on the French coast were suddenly attacked by a small squadron of British medium bombers. Other targets such as oil ponds near Rotterdam, the oil factories in Cologne and Meckburg, warehouses in Hamm and various industrial areas were also heavily bombed. Only two British aircraft did not return. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>London. While the German authorities are investigating the heavy losses caused by British aircraft bombing Berlin at the end of last week, Berlin again encountered an air raid this morning. The alert was issued at 0:45 AM and was lifted at 1:32 AM. According to a Berlin correspondent for the Swedish capital Nierhets Post, although British aircraft did not appear over the center of the city, the sound of explosions could be heard in the distance. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>Germany Announces the Results of Naval and Air Battles</p>

German bombers and fighter planes attacked the British Air Force base of Stinger in southern England. The airfields and buildings in Abingdon, Kinley, Gimsand, Dedlin Hawkins and Lynn were hit by bombs and caught fire in many places. As a result of the British aircraft responding to the battle, German aircraft still had the advantage. Last night, German aircraft bombed the ports of Liverpool, Goose Haven, Bristol and Chatham. Enemy aircraft attempted to attack Berlin and other cities in Germany last night, but the German anti-aircraft fire was extremely fierce, and the enemy did not succeed. Although some civilian residences were destroyed, no military facilities were lost. In total, the enemy aircraft lost sixty-two aircraft yesterday, of which fifty-two were shot down in air battles and ten were destroyed on the ground. Nine German aircraft were missing. (2nd, Haitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>British Air Force Launches Large-Scale Attacks on Italian Troops in North Africa, All Italian Airfields Bombed</h3>
<p>Cairo. The British Air Force Command here stated that the British Air Force has launched an unprecedented large-scale attack on Italian military targets in North Africa. Yesterday, British bombers attacked various major Italian airfields in eastern Libya. At least four Italian aircraft were destroyed by fire at Al-Mimayr airfield. A violent explosion occurred at the Tobruk airfield, destroying one Italian aircraft. Several others may have been damaged. At the Ghazala airfield, one Italian aircraft took off to respond to the battle, but was destroyed by exploding bombs. Italian fighter planes clashed with British bombers several times, but British aircraft still dropped bombs and hit targets everywhere. After the mission was completed, they all safely returned to their defense. Elitri was bombed by British aircraft on August 30, and several buildings were hit by bombs and caught fire. The British side suffered no losses. (2nd, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British and German Air Force Loss Figures Announced by British Ministry of Aviation</h3>
<p>London. According to the figures released by the British Ministry of Aviation, from August 25 to August 31, the German Air Force lost a total of 293 aircraft in air raids against Britain. The number of German aircraft that the British Ministry of Aviation bulletin indicated were almost completely damaged was almost equal to the number that were confirmed to have been destroyed. Most of the aircraft lost by the German side carried many crew members, so the loss of 293 aircraft meant the loss of more than 700 trained aviators. During the same period, Britain lost 113 fighter planes in national defense and 15 fighter planes in air raids on Germany. Sixty-nine British fighter plane personnel parachuted to safety. Therefore, the total loss of British Air Force crew members was about 110 people. Regarding the German General Command's claim that the British side lost a total of 133 aircraft on Saturday and the German side lost 32 aircraft, the London responsible party rejected this claim, saying that the correct figures for aircraft losses in the air battles on Saturday and Sunday were 86 for the German side and 37 for the British side. 25 of these 37 pilots survived unharmed. As far as pilots are concerned, the German side lost about 212 fighter and bomber pilots that day, while the British side lost only 12. The difference in the number of pilots lost by the two sides is very significant, and this is very important because Germany is now gradually feeling the difficulty of replenishing skilled pilots.

<h3>British Children's Liner Attacked by German Submarine, All Children on Board Rescued</h3>
<p>London. A British ship carrying evacuated British children was hit by a torpedo fired by a German submarine in the Atlantic Ocean on its way to Canada. However, none of the children were killed. The ship carried a total of 320 children and some other passengers. Only the ship's accountant was killed. When the children left the ship in lifeboats, they sang loudly. More than 70 of them were mostly wearing pajamas. They disembarked in a port in northern England last night, and some more children are expected to land today. The British Children Overseas Committee officially stated that details are not yet known, but it is known that the ship did not sink after being hit by a torpedo, and the children disembarked to rescue ships in an orderly manner. One of the rescue ships was a warship. The Under-Secretary of State for the Dominions, Shakespeare, welcomed the survivors, saying that their safe return was a miracle. When the group of children returned to England and disembarked yesterday, they were in high spirits as if nothing had happened. Two more batches then disembarked, also in high spirits and without fear. (2nd, Reuters)</p>

The Hungarian, Italian, and German embassies are guarded by soldiers and police, and police patrols are conducted in teams on the streets. Yesterday's demonstration took place in the city center and was later dispersed by police in armored vehicles, with several people arrested. During the demonstration, the area around the Royal Palace was cordoned off with ropes, disrupting traffic for several hours. The entire territory of Romania is in a state of unease and tension.

<p>Cluj, Outer Transylvania Province: This morning, Romanian and Hungarian troops clashed in the Romanian-Hungarian border area of Outer Transylvania. Nine Romanian military policemen were killed or seriously injured. The incident occurred because Romanian military police refused to allow Hungarian troops to cross the border near Voitzig, while the Hungarian troops, based on the terms of the Vienna Conference that ceded most of Outer Transylvania to Hungary, were attempting to cross the border. The first group of Hungarian troops crossed the border into Outer Transylvania north of Aredia-Mare this morning. Romanian senior military officials also learned that this afternoon, or even later, Hungarian troops would cross the border to Satu Mare, 100 kilometers north of Aremi-Mare. (United Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Romanas, Romanian Border: Since the Vienna Conference ruled to cede Romanian Outer Transylvania to Hungary, Romanian troops within the territory began to withdraw yesterday. At the same time, trucks carrying administrative files filled the roads. The Hungarian representative attending the mixed committee arrived here last night amidst a demonstration by thousands of people. Demonstrations also occurred elsewhere. In Timisoara, Romania's second largest city, people gathered in front of the German consulate. It is now known that 30,000 farmers demonstrated in Cluj, the capital of Outer Transylvania, smashing the windows of the consulate and planning to destroy the houses of Italians, but without success. In other parts of Outer Transylvania, actions against the territorial division have also taken place. 10,000 farmers in Brasov gathered in the square and solemnly knelt to swear that they would not cede an inch of land to the Hungarians. Shortly after, Neumann, leader of the German economic delegation, and another German official were surrounded by angry crowds. Although protected by the police and able to drive away, one swastika flag had been torn down. The German travel agency and the German consulate were both stormed by the crowd, and a picture of Hitler was torn up. The political circles in Bucharest are now very concerned about this kind of protest, fearing that the German side will take this opportunity to occupy Outer Transylvania, or even seize the Romanian mainland.

<h3>Romanian-Bulgarian Negotiations Nearing Conclusion</h3>
<p>Bucharest: Representatives from Romania and Bulgaria continued negotiations in Craiova yesterday, with two unresolved issues: (1) financial issues, and (2) the date of transfer of Southern Dobruja. Regarding the compensation for Romanian investments in the ceded area, it seems impossible to resolve, and it may be submitted to arbitration. However, the details are still unknown. It is generally expected that the negotiations will end today, and the draft will be signed no later than tomorrow. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Sofia: If Romania does not accept Bulgaria's proposal regarding Southern Dobruja within a day or two, the negotiations between the two countries seem likely to break down. The news of Romania's delay in its decision has caused anxiety here. Yesterday, King Boris of Bulgaria summoned Foreign Minister Popov, and the cabinet also held a special meeting. It is expected that the result will accelerate the final stage of the negotiations. Bulgarian representatives are currently stationed in the border town of Vidim, waiting for the final meeting with the Romanian representatives. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Hitler Receives Iranian and Portuguese Ambassadors</h3>

<h3>Sweden Holds Land and Air Exercises</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Land and air exercises will be held in central and western Sweden from September 2 to 6 and September 8 to 14, respectively. The scale is unprecedented in Sweden. After Sweden recently improved its air force organization, it will test its value in this exercise. Military and political authorities will also participate in air defense exercises, such as blackout drills. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Foreign Aircraft Fly Over Swiss Airspace</h3>
<p>Bern: Last night, another foreign aircraft flew over Swiss territory. According to official reports, alarms were issued in several places, and several bombs fell on vacant land in St. Cergue, with no one injured. Local troops opened fire on the aircraft. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Finland Reorganizes National Defense System</h3>
<p>Helsinki: The complete reorganization of the Finnish national defense system was announced yesterday. According to the new plan, all previously independent defense corps will be under the supervision of the Supreme Commander. All national defense groups will be concentrated in Helsinki. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>President of the Bank of France Replaced</h3>
<p>Vichy: The government recently ordered the appointment of Vice President of the Bank of France, Bausson, as President, succeeding Jean-Yves Jouanjan. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>French Forces in Equatorial Africa Respond to de Gaulle; French Colonial Minister Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>London: Official sources announced that the French forces in Equatorial Africa have fully responded to General de Gaulle. Governor-General Maison has led the political and military authorities of the colony to stand under the flag of Free France. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Vichy: French Colonial Minister Rommel addressed yesterday, commenting on the status of French colonies. He first stated that the governors of Cameroon and New Caledonia were immediately dismissed for disobeying orders. At the same time, he received a report from the French High Commissioner in Dakar, stating that order was peaceful there and that the region was determined to be loyal to the new government. Demonstrations held by French residents did not receive support from the local natives. Rommel declared that the cause of the riots in French colonies was partly due to the restrictions of the armistice agreement and partly due to the difficult economic situation, which caused French residents in the colonies to be not well-informed about the real situation in their home country. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The Swedish People's Party mouthpiece, Tidningen, reported that French Equatorial Africa and Cameroon, which are no longer loyal to the Pétain government, although not wealthy colonies, are in a position of great military value to Italy's colonies. British troops can pass through them to attack Libya. Currently, Britain has not yet won in the African war. The fall of Somaliland, although not important in reality, is an undeniable loss of prestige. Therefore, it is surprising that the above-mentioned two French colonies joined hands with Britain after the fall of Somaliland. In fact, it was caused by the victory of the British air war. Therefore, this matter proves that Britain will not be defeated by the German blitzkrieg tactics as France was. At first, the above two colonies thought that Britain's failure was inevitable due to the impression of the French surrender, but now they have more confidence in Britain's resistance. The closer approach between Britain and the United States has greatly enhanced this confidence. Britain's loss of Somaliland can be compensated for by the actions of the above two colonies. It is not known whether other French colonies will follow suit. There are already many factual manifestations that not all French territories agree with the Vichy government. Germany and Italy have now accused the newspapers in French North Africa of not being loyal to the armistice agreement. The British troops in North Africa are gradually increasing their strength, and we will probably see a long period of fierce fighting in that area. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Lithuanian Representatives Leave Soviet Union and Return Home</h3>
<p>Moscow: The delegation of the People's Committee of the Lithuanian Republic returned home yesterday after inspecting Minsk for several days. The delegation visited Minsk to study the administrative and socialist construction plans of the Belarusian Republic, and also visited factories, children's institutions, theaters, etc. (TASS, 2nd)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to Shaskov, Chairman of the Soviet Inland Waterway Administration Committee, "Since the liberation of Bessarabia, Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, the Soviet Union has added new waterways, such as the vast Dniester, the Daugava River flowing into the Gulf of Riga, the West Neman River, the Embe, Narva, Zha River and Lake Peipus and Lake Pskov in the Estonian Republic. Passenger transport on the Dniester River will begin on September 15 in the Yakto-Pendeli section (200 kilometers), and the navigable distance will gradually increase to 600 kilometers in the future. In Lithuania, shipping will soon begin on the Neman and other rivers. The Estonian inland waterway route totals 600 kilometers. Soviet shipping experts will soon go to Kaunas, Riga, and Zha to inspect the new waterways." (TASS, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Insurers Offer Air Raid Insurance</h3>
<p>London: Lloyd's insurance company is now offering air raid insurance. Insured parties pay a monthly premium of one shilling, and can receive 50 pounds in the event of death or serious injury in an air raid. This plan is very popular. The method is based on large employers selling unrestricted insurance to employees. Anyone employed can be insured regardless of how dangerous their work is, but those serving active duty in the national defense army are not eligible for insurance. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Churchill's Youthful Romance</h3>
<p>After Churchill was captured, the natives did not want his life. However, they said to him, even though you are a journalist, we cannot let you run away. We cannot capture a noble's son every day. Thus, he was imprisoned in the prisoner-of-war camp of the National Model School, heavily guarded on all sides. Although he repeatedly said that he was a journalist and demanded release, they said that he had participated in combat and could not be released. So Churchill looked for an opportunity to escape. Fortunately, one night, while two guards were smoking and chatting, he jumped over the wall, passed through the gate, and walked boldly to the street. But this place was still 300 miles away from the neutral Portuguese territory of Delagoa Bay. At dawn, scouts would inevitably be sent out, making it difficult to hide. He was wearing a brown flannel suit, had 75 pounds and four chocolate bars in his pocket. He had neither a map nor a compass; even more impossible, he could not speak a word of Dutch or the local dialect, how could he obtain food or inquire about the route?</p>
<p>Churchill reconsidered what to do if he didn't leave, so he had to grope along the railway line in the dark. After walking for about two hours, he saw the lights of a train station ahead, so he stopped 200 yards away from the platform. After waiting for more than an hour, he saw a train coming. He disregarded everything, climbed onto the coupling, got on the car, and slept in the pile of coal dust all night. Before dawn the next day, he did not wait for the train to stop, but held the iron rod at the end of the car with both hands, and jumped to the ground again. He found some water to drink along the way, and felt that he had not gone wrong. Seeing that the sky was getting brighter, he had to find a clump of trees beside a valley to hide. He didn't start walking until after midnight. People were stationed on every bridge, so he had to go around, pass through bushes and wade through streams, inching forward step by step. Unfortunately, he had lacked exercise for more than a month in prison, and at this time he felt tired as soon as he moved a little.</p>
<p>As he staggered forward, he suddenly saw two or three lights on the left. As he walked closer, he realized that the lights were from the engine room of a coal mine, a two-story building. He first knocked on the door, but there was no response; after knocking for a while, he heard footsteps coming down the stairs, and the door was opened abruptly. This person was very tall, wearing messy clothes, with a pale complexion and a black mustache. He asked Churchill in English, "What do you want?"</p>
<p>Churchill narrated how he encountered danger along the way, how he was injured in a fall from the train, and how he couldn't find his friends, etc., making up a lot of stories. The man looked at him carefully, and after a moment of hesitation, he said, "Okay, come in." Churchill walked past him into the room, thinking, don't let it be a prison again. The man turned on the lamp and put the pistol he was holding in his hand on the table. After a moment of silence, he said, "I would like to hear the details of your train accident again." I replied, "I might as well tell you the truth." He took the risk and said frankly: "I am Churchill, a war correspondent for the London Morning Post. I escaped from Pretoria last night. Now I want to go to the border. Can you help me?" Everyone was silent for a while again. The man slowly stood up, went to lock the door, and then turned around and reached out his hand to him and said: "Thank God, you came here! Within these twenty miles, you would be caught anywhere except in this house. We are all members of the British League, and of course we will make you pass safely."</p>
<p>The next morning, the man told him that the local government had indeed searched for his trail everywhere. After another day, it gradually cooled down. He hid in the cellar for five days, and the man ran over and said to him that on the 19th, a Dutchman was going to load a batch of wool to Delagoa Bay. This Dutchman had no ill feelings towards the British. He wanted to pile up the wool bales into a gap, hide Churchill inside, and smuggle him out of the border with the car, which would be fine.</p>
<p>At 2:00 a.m. on the 19th, the man led Churchill out of the house, where three trucks were waiting. Churchill drilled into the pile of wool in the first car, where there was a gap large enough for him to sit and lie down, and he was also equipped with a pistol, two smoked chickens, a few pieces of meat, a long loaf of bread, a melon, and three bottles of cold tea. Although the journey was only 16 hours, there may be delays along the way, so too much food should not be prepared.</p>
<p>All the way, Churchill was uneasy, fearing that something might go wrong again. After one night, he arrived at Komatipoort, which was already Portuguese territory, and he did not encounter any inspection. Churchill was so happy for a while that he couldn't help but stretch his head out of the pile of wool and cheer loudly. And he fired two or three shots into the air to celebrate his escape. The car drove to the city of Lourenço Marques, and he quietly got off the car and mingled in the crowd. After walking a few streets, he arrived at a house. Churchill looked up and saw the British flag hoisted high, it turned out to be the British Consulate.</p>
<p>Churchill returned to Durban, the port was brightly lit, and the naval commander and the mayor went on board to shake hands with him and congratulate him. He had a very happy St. John's Night there. On June 1, 1900, four days after the British army's attack, it captured Pretoria. On the morning of the 5th, Churchill and a major rode into the city. When he arrived in front of the National Model School, Churchill raised his hat and cheered. The imprisoned British officers and soldiers inside responded to the sound, and then opened the prison door and poured out; on one side, they raised the British flag, and everyone cheered. The Boer War ended here. Churchill soon returned home, and everyone expressed great interest in his capture and escape. From then on, Churchill's name was deeply imprinted in people's minds, which was of great help to him in his political life. At this time, Churchill was 26 years old. He married in the fall of 1908, hoping to live a happy life from then on. However, there are still many troubles. (End of this article)</p>

<h3>First Anniversary of the European War Today; Shanghai International Settlement Remains Neutral; Continues to Maintain International Characteristics; No Disturbances Due to the War</h3>
<p>Today marks the first anniversary of Britain's declaration of war against Germany. The state of war began at 11:00 AM British Summer Time (6:00 PM Shanghai Time), because the German government did not respond to the British government's ultimatum to withdraw German troops from Poland. The war between Germany and Poland had been going on since September 1, and many Polish cities and towns, including the capital Warsaw, had been bombed, resulting in significant loss of life.</p>
<p>General Response to the Declaration of War</p>
<p>At that time, the British wartime cabinet had just been formed, and Churchill was appointed First Lord of the Admiralty. In Shanghai, the first reaction to the news of the outbreak of war was gloom and depression. In the British community, there was a sense of relief because they realized that with the outbreak of war, the policy of appeasement had come to an end. France's plan for full mobilization was also completed, and French citizens between the ages of 20 and 49 registered with the French Consulate General in preparation for being called into service at any time. French reserve soldiers of the first level gathered at the French barracks.</p>
<p>Slight Impact on Shipping</p>
<p>Shipping was in a state of chaos. The French mail ship "La Bourdonnais," which was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on September 1, was recalled to Hong Kong. It was generally claimed that German ships would not come to Shanghai, but British shipping companies said that the schedules would still be carried out as usual. The entire city of Shanghai was still peaceful. Only one conflict occurred between British soldiers and French residents, but there were no serious disturbances. At that time, officials from the British and French concessions declared that no special precautions would be implemented in their respective concessions as a result of the declaration of war, as they believed that this was unnecessary.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Police Patrolled Western Shanghai Yesterday; American Units of the 'B' Company Shanghai Volunteer Corps Scheduled to Replace Defensive Duties</h3>
<p>After the withdrawal of British troops, the defensive areas they left behind, including the 'D' Zone in western Shanghai, were originally scheduled to be taken over by the Japanese army, but the Japanese side has not yet taken over. However, since the afternoon of the day before yesterday, patrols by Japanese military police have suddenly been discovered in the area west of Difeng Road and the Yuyuan Road area of Jessfield Road in the 'D' Zone. Yesterday morning and afternoon, these Japanese military police teams were still patrolling back and forth. It is understood that the Japanese military police came from outside the railway line. Each squad consisted of twelve soldiers led by a squad leader. The Japanese military police patrolling in 'D' Zone yesterday totaled two times, from 9:30 AM to 11:00 AM in the morning and from 3:00 PM to 4:30 PM in the afternoon. According to the Pingming News Agency's inquiries with relevant parties, the American unit of the 'B' Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps is scheduled to withdraw from its defensive duties at 7:00 PM tomorrow (4th) and be replaced by the British unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. Subsequently, it is stipulated that the British 'A' Company, the armored car company, and the light cavalry unit will be on duty in the Hongkou West District for one week, and then the American 'B' Company will be on duty for four days. Because the number of British volunteers is larger than that of American volunteers, the British volunteers will be on duty for one week and rest for four days each time, while the American volunteers will be on duty for four days and rest for one week.</p>
<h3>Anlitde to Leave Shanghai Regularly; Six Groups Hosted Farewell Banquet Yesterday; Mr. and Mrs. Anlitde Depart on the 5th</h3>

<p>Last Night's Grand Banquet</p>
<p>The American Alumni Association, the Chinese Students Returned from America Association, the Lian Qing Society, the Chinese Fine Arts Society, the Children's Nutrition Promotion Association, and the Sino-Western Friendship Society, these six groups, specially hosted a farewell banquet for Mr. Anlitde at the American Club last night. Mr. Zhu Boquan, the President of the Chinese Students Returned from America Association, presided, and Mr. Yang Yongqing, the President of Soochow University, delivered a farewell speech.

<h3>Two Kidnapping Cases Yesterday; One Rice Merchant Abducted; Jin Benren Was Forced into a Car; Lu Youyuan Was Not Taken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, two kidnapping cases occurred on the boundary-crossing Bailinan Road in West Shanghai and on Avenue Albert in the French Concession. One involved Jin Benren, the owner of Renfeng Rice Mill, who was abducted into a Xiang Sheng automobile. The other involved Lu Youyuan, a wealthy merchant from Haimen, who was not taken. The bandits were all apprehended. The details of each case, as ascertained through investigations, are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Merchant Abducted; Partner in a Rice Mill with Some Savings</p>
<p>Jin Benren is from Zhenru, 42 years old, and a rice merchant. He usually operates diligently and is skilled in business, with some savings in hand. He invested with friends to open Renfeng Rice Mill at 323 Bailinan Road and also established a Renfeng Rice Store at 502 of the same road. It has been in operation for years. His family resides in the store. Jin always personally goes to the Qinglian Pavilion Rice Market on Fuzhou Road to negotiate transactions, which is his usual practice. He also always visits the rice mill for inspection before heading east by car.</p>
<p>Bandits Rush Out and Force Him into a Car</p>
<p>At about 10:15 AM yesterday morning, Jin had just stepped out of the store, intending to go to the mill. Just as his car passed the entrance of the Lu Xuezhai Lane, no more than thirty or so storefronts away from the mill, six bandits suddenly rushed out from the side of the road. Two of them held pistols, aiming at Jin's chest, threatening and intimidating him, and forcibly dragged Jin into a Xiang Sheng automobile that had been pre-positioned by the roadside. The car then sped east, passing in front of the Renfeng Rice Mill and quickly driving away.</p>
<p>Friend Sends a Message; Eldest Daughter Reports to the Police</p>
<p>At that time, Qiu Shunjin, the owner of the Shun Jin Restaurant nearby, witnessed the scene (Qiu and Jin are also acquainted). He immediately rushed to the Renfeng Rice Store to report Jin's abduction. Then Jin's eldest daughter hurried to the police station to report the incident. Jin's abduction yesterday was clearly a case of kidnapping for ransom. It is reported that although Jin has partnered with others to invest in the rice mill and store, due to excessive costs and huge expenses in recent years, coupled with the continuous warfare, his family property has been depleted, and he is not a wealthy man. This abduction may be due to a misunderstanding by the bandits.</p>
<p>Bandits Seize a Xiang Sheng Automobile</p>
<p>As for the car used to abduct Jin, it was seized by the bandits beforehand. Yesterday morning, several people went to the Jiaozhou Road branch of Xiang Sheng Automobile and hired a car. The company dispatched driver to drive car number 843 to take them to a certain place. The bandits then drove the driver out of the car, and one of the bandits drove it himself. The car then headed west to Bailinan Road, kidnapped Jin Benren, and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the driver reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple Police Station and requested an investigation. It is reported that the car has been found on Gordon Road.</p>
<p>Wealthy Merchant Escapes; Wealthy Merchant from Haimen Resides in Shanghai</p>
<p>At 12:35 PM yesterday, an attempted kidnapping occurred at No. 1 Avenue Albert New Village on Avenue Albert in the French Concession. According to investigations, Lu Youyuan, a gentleman from Haimen, 49 years old, originally resided in his hometown of Haimen and had a wealthy family. After the outbreak of the war, he could not stay there for long and brought his family to Shanghai, residing at No. 1 Avenue Albert New Village. At 12:35 PM yesterday, five people suddenly arrived in a black-plated car No. 385 and drove to the entrance of Avenue Albert New Village.</p>
<p>Four People Arrive Suddenly Seeking an Audience</p>
<p>Four people got out of the car, two wearing light-colored suits, one wearing a white silk long gown, and one wearing a white short shirt. They knocked on the door and said they had important matters to discuss with Mr. Lu. Lu was in the bedroom upstairs at the time. A servant went upstairs to inform him that someone was seeking an audience. Lu, knowing that the visitors were uninvited and suspecting something was amiss, instructed the servant to inquire about the details and what the matter was. The servant then went downstairs again to ask for their names one by one. Unexpectedly, the one wearing the white short shirt became impatient and, in a threatening manner, tried to go upstairs himself. Fortunately, the servant stopped him.</p>
<p>Maid Alertly Sneaks Out to Report to the Police</p>
<p>Another female servant, seeing this situation, knew that these people were definitely not good, and took the opportunity to sneak out from the back door to report to the patrolman in that alley. The patrolman, lacking firearms, feared he could not confront them and urgently reported to the patrolman stationed nearby. The patrolman immediately notified the French garrison on Fulu Li Road and requested that they call the police station. Several French soldiers rushed to the scene to assist in the search and fired two shots as a warning. The bandits inside had already seized Lu and were about to drag him downstairs when...</p>
<p>Detectives Gather; All Are Arrested</p>
<p>Suddenly hearing the gunshots, they knew they were exposed. They rushed downstairs, attempting to escape, but realizing the situation was unfavorable and that it was difficult to escape, they fled into No. 556 Avenue Albert to temporarily hide. At this time, the French police station had dispatched a large number of detectives, arriving in three armored cars, and surrounded the No. 556 house and the surrounding area. Several detectives bravely entered and searched the premises. As a result, all five bandits were captured on the spot, and the car was also taken back to the police station for investigation. Afterwards, the servant said that one of the bandits seemed to be named Shen Pengsan, who was a fellow villager of Lu, but they had not seen each other for a long time and did not know why he was leading the bandits to kidnap him.</p>
<h3>An Overseas Chinese Compatriot from the Philippines' Impression of Shanghai: An Open Letter to This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Li Pingying, an overseas Chinese compatriot from the Philippines, sent a letter to this newspaper, expressing his immense disappointment and curses towards Shanghai. After reading it, we found that we could not deny a single sentence, because what he said was all facts. Only overseas Chinese compatriots returning from abroad can see it so clearly. Readers should chew on these candid words and be alert!</p>
<p>Editor of Shen Bao Newspaper, I have lived in the Philippines since I was a child, and I have always received local education. I know very little about the situation in my motherland, and I am even more unfamiliar with the Chinese language. I dare not show off my skills and make a fool of myself. However, uncontrollable emotions forced me to take this path, so I can only scribble this letter to you in black and white. Although there are no brilliant words or superb theories in this letter to satisfy you, every word and sentence is the crystallization of my bitter tears!</p>
<p>I have long admired the greatness and prosperity of Shanghai, and I have always wanted to see Shanghai's demeanor to fulfill my lifelong aspiration. Finally, a few days ago, I arrived in my motherland's embrace from the distant South Seas like a child, hoping to tell this mother-like homeland about the pitiful fate and miserable experiences of overseas Chinese. But I am disappointed, completely disappointed. Not only is the motherland not as kind and lovely as I imagined, but it is also like a ferocious demon, wanting to throw the lives of every compatriot into a fiery pit at all times.</p>
<p>Although I have only been in Shanghai for a week, all the evil phenomena in Shanghai have filled my entire mind. I cannot help but write it down as a farewell memento and my feelings about this trip.</p>
<p>"Dance girls and wild chickens" are more numerous than carps in the Huangpu River. What guides, halls, salted meat, and whatnot, bizarre and dazzling. The women's market seems to have become one of the most prosperous businesses in Shanghai. After asking the local elders, I learned that countless Shanghai residents rely on their daughters for a living. Although these words are too unfair to Shanghai compatriots, the manifestation of facts makes me suspicious!</p>
<p>"Hotels and dance halls" are everywhere. The degree of their extravagance is rarely seen in major cities around the world. Alas! The heavy calamities Shanghai has suffered in the past are still deeply etched in the hearts of every Chinese person. Moreover, Shanghai compatriots have witnessed countless martyrs shedding blood for freedom and sacrificing themselves for the nation. How should they strive to be energetic, frugal, and endure hardship to assist in the completion of the war of resistance and national reconstruction? But the reality is not so. They are infatuated with singing and dancing, moving towards destruction in a drunken stupor. How can this not be heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Following the advancement of extravagance is the arrival of various crimes and killings. Therefore, kidnapping and assassination incidents occur several times a day, almost turning the entire Shanghai into a terrifying slaughterhouse. In any corner, there is the possibility of encountering danger and death; especially for me, who has just returned from overseas, I have become much thinner because of it.</p>
<p>"Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road, corpses freeze to death." This sentence can be said to be a sketch of Shanghai society. Indeed, on the one hand, Shanghai is brightly lit, with melodious singing and dancing, but in another realm, there are cries of sorrow everywhere, and starving corpses block the roads. They cannot eat when hungry, cannot wear warm clothes when cold, and their poverty is extremely miserable. Alas! They are all Chinese compatriots, but their circumstances are so different, more than heaven and earth? We can see that the guests in dance halls and hotels are so crowded and extravagant. Why are there so few people who give alms to these poor people?</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I want to leave Shanghai and go to the inland, because I hate everything in Shanghai. I curse Shanghai's compatriots, and I don't want to stay in this devil's cave any longer. However, the broken walls and debris in the lost areas, the bullet holes and scars, and the emaciated and starving shadows and cries on the streets will forever be active in my heart.</p>
<p>I am not a writer. I don't know how to modify or embellish. I can only present my naked heart to you. If you think it is worth publishing it in your newspaper, then I will be infinitely gratified. Because in this way, it can let the intoxicated compatriots in Shanghai know the curses of overseas Chinese towards them! That's all. I wish you good health. Li Pingying</p>
<p>September 2nd, at the Shanghai River.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Market: Winter Clothing Donation; Various Industries Actively Raise Funds; Individual Donations Also Very Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>Since the National Fundraising Association promoted the fundraising of 10 million yuan for this year's winter clothing donations, all sectors of Shanghai have responded enthusiastically.

<h3>British Troop Transport Ships Without Naval Escort; All Departed Shanghai Southward Successively; Heading to Undisclosed Ports</h3>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Times," the report that several troop transport ships carrying British troops withdrawing from Shanghai were gathering a few miles outside Wusong, waiting for British warships to arrive to escort them south, was denied by British naval officials yesterday (the 1st). It is said that the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Haosheng, Desheng, Yisheng, and Yongsheng, which carried troops leaving Shanghai, have been taken over by the British government and converted into troop transport ships. They are all sailing south independently without naval escort. The first ship sailed out on August 23rd, heading directly to an undisclosed southern port. The remaining ships are carrying troops and setting sail about every two days.</p>
<h3>Inter-Provincial Remittances Among Five Provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Anhui; Can be Handled by Shanghai Branches According to Convenient Domestic Remittance Methods</h3>
<p>The local banks of five provinces, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Anhui, namely Jiangsu Farmers Bank, Zhejiang Local Bank, Jiangxi Yumin Bank, Anhui Local Bank, and Fujian Provincial Bank, have established the Joint Inter-Provincial Remittance Office of Local Banks of the Five Southeastern Provinces to invigorate local finance and strengthen the connection between the banks. The general office is located in Shangrao and is handled in accordance with the convenient domestic remittance methods promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, each bank collects the subsidiary currency of each bank for each other. Those who remit money from Shanghai to various provinces can entrust the Shanghai branch or the Shanghai office of each bank to handle it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Garbage Decreases by One-Fifth; Population Decreases by 500,000</h3>
<p>Since the prices in Shanghai have soared, most of the poorer people have been unable to maintain their livelihoods, so they have all gone to the inland to engage in all kinds of rear-area work. According to statistics from the concession authorities, the population of Shanghai has therefore sharply decreased by 500,000. In the past year, the rental of vacant houses in the concession has been very rare, but now it is not as serious as before, and it can be freely rented. According to the French Municipal Council, the garbage collected within the boundary in July this year was 19,976 cubic meters, with an average daily cleanup of about 644 cubic meters, while in the same period last year, it was 25,135 cubic meters, with an average daily cleanup of 810 cubic meters. This further proves that the population has decreased, and the amount of garbage has also decreased proportionally.</p>
<h3>Industrial Safety Training Class Still Has Vacancies</h3>
<p>For the sake of industrial safety and to instill industrial knowledge, the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council previously decided to continue to hold the "Industrial Safety and Knowledge Training Class" free of charge, and registration procedures were held at the West District Health Branch on the evening of August 30. At that time, those who went to register were quite enthusiastic. Those who were admitted included 62 foremen and coppersmiths from 27 machine and iron factories.

<h3>High Tide Season Has Arrived; Autumn Winds Swept Tightly Last Night; The Tail of the Hurricane Passed Anqing and Disturbed Shanghai; Wusong Dike is Feared to Collapse and Break</h3>
<p>Outside the mouth of Wusong, the sea tide has risen high recently, and the sky is filled with dark clouds, as if there is a wind and tide phenomenon. The lighthouse of the Pao Taiwan Customs has special signals to warn navigation. Yesterday, low-lying areas such as Yizhou Tang and Zhanghua Hamlets in Wusong have been flooded by the sea tide. However, the section of Beishidong Wuyuedun in Baoshan has not been repaired for three years since the fall of Shanghai, causing a lot of damage to the wooden piles and stone masonry, and the soil has also become loose and subsided. If there is a flood, it is feared that there will be a collapse. Although Chuan Xiaoan has repeatedly sent people to investigate the dangerous situation and survey the construction, there is still no news of repair.</p>
<p>Wind Passes Anqing</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Xujiahui Observatory, after the hurricane landed in Fujian, it turned north, crossed Jiangxi and entered Anhui, and had reached 31 degrees north latitude and 117 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM yesterday, still advancing north, with the center within 60 nautical miles. According to the above-mentioned direction, the hurricane has passed Anqing, southwest of Nanjing. According to the Nanjing Meteorological Report at 6:00 AM yesterday, there was already a force of six winds locally, and this city also had a force of four winds, both affected by the hurricane's wind wings, causing the weather to be uncertain.</p>
<p>Another Hurricane</p>
<p>According to the Observatory report, another hurricane in the Pacific Ocean had reached 19 degrees north latitude and 135 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM yesterday, heading northwest, with the center within 120 nautical miles. According to the hurricane's progress, if the direction remains unchanged, Shanghai will be seriously threatened again.</p>
<p>Navigation Resumes</p>
<p>This time, this city was spared from the typhoon attack yesterday. The customs office took down the black ball, the second typhoon signal, which was hung at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, at 5:30 AM yesterday. The navigation warning in this city has been lifted, and import and export ships have resumed. Taikoo's Hai (Mouth) Zhejiang, Jardine's Fusheng (the report yesterday mistakenly wrote Fousheng), and other ships have been exported yesterday. The American President Lines' President Pierce was on time to Shanghai yesterday morning. It was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 2:00 AM this morning (i.e., midnight last night) to return to the United States via Japan. It is learned that loading and unloading of goods is not enough, and it has been changed to depart at 12:30 PM today (summer time). The last small passenger boat will depart from the new customs wharf at 11:00 AM today. Java Company's new mail ship Zhizha Lianjia will arrive in port this morning and berth at the Puxi Lansancong Wharf. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Yusheng and Taikoo Company's Taiyuan and Qiongzhou are expected to arrive today. The Shengjing, which came from Qingdao yesterday morning, returned to Qingdao to take shelter from the hurricane at sea and may not be able to arrive today.</p>
<p>Wind and Rain Attack Together</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the weather in this city was affected by the hurricane wind wing that reached southwest of Nanjing. From 1:00 PM, it rained heavily until late at night. At the same time, the wind was also quite strong. From 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM yesterday, the autumn tide of the Huangpu River suddenly broke out again and was lifted by the wind, so the amount of water was quite large. Low-lying roads all had tide water coming out, so the accumulated water in the rain had no way to drain away. The two combined, and the roads were flooded, such as Nanjing Road, Zhejiang Road, Yinghua Street, Guizhou Road, Alabast Road, and Saposai Road, all with half a foot of water. Valuation Association Sends Another Letter to Various Agencies for Group Rice Purchases</p>
<h3>Evaluation Increases; Public Opinion Boils Over</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee sent letters to the relevant agencies and organizations yesterday, allowing them to forward letters to various industry associations and major factories and businesses to jointly promote group rice purchases, so as to avoid large quantities of rice from being manipulated and monopolized by speculative rice merchants. At the same time, it makes the rice on the market fresh and unpopular, and the rice stocks in the rice warehouses can also increase sharply. It not only relieves the pain of individual citizens but also stabilizes social order. It is heard that the above four agencies and organizations decided to act accordingly after receiving the letter.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Fall Back</p>
<p>The Rice Bank Tea Market opened as usual at 7:30 AM yesterday morning. The market was full of spot goods. Large households not only stopped selling but also took the opportunity to make a large profit from the rice they had hoarded. At the same time, the rice companies had weak appetite, and the customer base was also sluggish. As a result, the price fell sharply by about one yuan compared to the previous market. Except for the Saigon No. 1 rice station, which set the original price, the price of foreign rice at other stalls seems to have gradually entered the 60 yuan range. According to the Market Management Committee, it is because the Shanghai-Vietnam shipping has been confirmed to have resumed.</p>
<p>Evaluation and Discussion</p>
<p>Recently, the Rice Price Evaluation Committee consulted and decided to uniformly increase the price of various rice types by two yuan, which caused public opinion to boil over and the public to be agitated. It is generally recognized that at this time when everything is expensive, if the price of rice is increased again, the lives of citizens will be even more difficult, and the Evaluation Committee's tolerance of the price limit is unnecessary and has no solid reason. Therefore, all are eagerly looking forward to the relevant authorities to stop it and re-evaluate the price of rice to relieve the suffering of the citizens.</p>
<h3>Pu Lanxi Resumes Duties After Recovery</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Pu Lanxi, the Deputy Director of the Police Department of the French Concession Municipal Council, who was attacked and injured by thugs on the morning of the 27th of last month, has now fully recovered and went to the Police Department today (the 2nd) to resume his duties.

<h3>Thugs Ride Without Tickets, Brandishing Weapons as Threats; Ticket Inspection and Compelled Ticket Purchase Result in Violent Assault; Glass Windows of Three Public Buses Destroyed</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "North China Daily News," shortly after 8 PM one evening, at the intersection of Great Western Road and Columbia Road within the Shanghai Western Public Concession, sixteen thugs wielding handguns and hand grenades violently assaulted a ticket inspector of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company public bus line, and</p>
<p>Maliciously Smashed</p>
<p>the glass windows of three public buses belonging to the company, causing passengers in the vehicles to be frightened and perturbed. The thugs' violent acts lasted for approximately ten minutes. Neither Public Concession police nor "municipal police" were seen on the scene. It is reported that this area was previously within the British military's defense zone. In the past week, British troops have been successively withdrawing from Shanghai. Residents in the area deeply fear that with no British military to defend and a lack of adequate police protection, similar incidents of</p>
<p>Violent Behavior</p>
<p>will soon reoccur as they did last night.</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, the thugs initially boarded a public bus on Great Western Road going towards Columbia Road, but did not pay their fares. A ticket inspector on the bus compelled them to purchase tickets. The thugs then drew out handguns and hand grenades, ordering the bus to stop. Several of the thugs disembarked first, while the remaining ones repeatedly assaulted the ticket inspector. Fortunately, he</p>
<p>Did Not Suffer Serious Injuries.</p>
<p>After disembarking and carrying out their violence, the thugs, not satisfied, smashed the bus windows. Simultaneously, two other public buses coming from the opposite direction were also stopped and had their windows smashed by the thugs. The thugs did not rob or loot, seemingly satisfied with frightening the passengers. Finally, they brandished their handguns and hand grenades, yelling and rushing into the countryside beside the road and disappearing.</p>
<h3>Murder Case Occurs on Qujiang Road, Hongkou; Brothel Owner Stabbed to Death</h3>
<p>At around 6 AM one morning, a man, approximately thirty years old, was discovered lying in a pool of blood in front of the Korean Kindergarten near the Guangdong Street railway line on Qujiang Road, Hongkou.

<p>Second Incident: This occurred near Hansbury Road. Shen Quanlin, a rice merchant from No. 328 Nanxun Road, was walking in the area when he was suddenly accosted by three robbers who threatened him with weapons. They robbed him of all the legal tender, $155, and Japanese military scrip, $85, that he had on his person, then left triumphantly.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We are writing on behalf of our client, Mr. Zhang Zuwang, who claims to have read the article titled "(Sugar Merchant Abandons Paramour After Seduction; Paramour Demands Support)" in the local news section of the September 2nd issue of "Shen Bao". He states that the content is inconsistent with the facts. He has never had any relationship with Miss Xi, there has never been any cohabitation, and there is no possibility of having a daughter or being pregnant. Furthermore, the statement that attorney Yu Bingwen came forward to mediate is also untrue. Miss Xi's attempt to seek mediation from the court involves false accusations and lacks factual basis, clearly intending to damage our client's reputation and motivated by ulterior motives. He requests that you send letters to various newspapers to correct the record, etc. Accordingly, we are writing to you on his behalf, requesting you to publish this letter to clarify public perception and maintain professional courtesy. Sincerely, "Shen Bao" Office, Attorneys Li Baosen and Yu Bingwen.</p>

<h3>Bao Da Silver Shop Privately Melting Silver Coins; Prosecuted Under Regulations on Obstructing the Currency System; Manager and Accountant Detained Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>Bao Da Silver Shop, located at No. 46 Yongkang Lane, No. 175, Alabaster Road, is owned by Xu Changfa from Shaoxing, with Shao Qida (also known as Yongchuan) from Shaoxing serving as manager and Xue Jinfu (also known as Zhilin) as the accountant. The shop also rented a portion of the remaining space in the Yu Tai Ironworks at No. 19, Lane 725, Yu Qiaqing Road, to use as a</p>
<p>Melting Location.</p>
<p>Recently, the New Zhabei police, including Chinese detectives Xu Shutian and Gong Youwei, discovered that the shop was exclusively collecting various old-style silver coins for melting, which violates the regulations on obstructing the currency system. Accordingly, at 11 AM on the 1st of this month, they rushed to Yu Tai and found four people from Shaoxing - Yu Yusheng, Wu Rongbao, Xia Jicai, and Feng Changfu - melting silver coins. They were arrested and $91 in double and single-dime silver coins were confiscated.</p>
<p>Following the Interrogation,</p>
<p>the police went to Bao Da Silver Shop and apprehended Shao, Xue, and another silver furnace owner, Wang Changgen.

They confessed that the silver dollars, etc., were melted on behalf of Yu Yonghe Silver Shop on Fujian Road. The detectives</p>
<p>Rushed to Investigate,</p>
<p>but Yu Yonghe denied it, only claiming to have entrusted them to melt over 150 taels of silver utensils, but now nothing is being melted. The owner of Bao Da, Xu Changfa, had gone to his hometown and could not be located. Yesterday morning, the police sent Shao and Xue to the Second Criminal Division of the Special First Court, and the police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted them under Article 20 of the Regulations on Obstructing the Currency System. Shao and Xue jointly hired attorney Hang Shijun to defend them. Under</p>
<p>Interrogation, All Defendants Jointly Confessed</p>
<p>that the silver ingots, etc., were melted from old silver utensils collected by the shop owner from Huzhou. The confiscated silver coins, etc., were collected to be exchanged for cash at the Central Bank.

<h3>Finance; Foreign Exchange Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Regarding the foreign exchange market yesterday, the HSBC list showed that the pound sterling did not move, and the US dollar continued to shrink by one-two-five, changing to five yuan one-eight-seven-five. As for the situation in the domestic market, it was mediocre and quiet. Operators were mostly observing the market, and speculators were both entering and exiting. Non-bank businesses supplied a considerable amount. Foreign firms had some transactions in rice and cotton, so the market wanted to loosen but stopped. After opening in the morning, the US dollar once rose to five yuan three-seven-five. The noon close was still flat. The after-market was initially quiet, then slightly softened. Finally, it closed steadily due to the balance of supply and demand. The gold exchange for March was three pence five-four-six-eight-seven-five, unchanged. The US dollar was five yuan three-one-two-five, easing by zero-three-one-two-five. Futures for October and November were both traded. It is estimated that the gold exchange eased only zero-one-five-six-two-five, and the US dollar difference was only zero-three-one-two-five.</p>
<p>Transactions in Foreign Rice and Foreign Cotton are Still Strong</p>
<p>Initially in the morning, the exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar was unchanged, and the exchange rate for Shanghai was also flat. There was no market for the exchange rate for France. The exchange rates for the Central Bank were as before. The selling prices for spot goods when banks opened in the morning were three pence five-six-two-five for gold and five yuan two-eight-one-two-five for the US dollar, which was zero-one-five-six-two-five longer for gold and zero-three-one-two-five harder for the US dollar compared to the closing price on Saturday of last week. Afterwards, South China speculators came to sell, and the market became quiet and loosened. It is estimated that non-bank businesses absorbed US dollars at a price of five yuan three-one-two-five, with the longest reaching five-three-seven-five. The HSBC list revealed that the pound sterling was unchanged, and the US dollar was tighter by one-two-five, changing to five yuan one-eight-seven-five. After this, Chinese merchants were already inclined to buy, and the potential was stable. It is estimated that American banks sold US dollars for May at five-three-one-two-five to non-bank businesses and speculators. Later, foreign firms also had some transactions in rice and cotton, and the balance between buyers and sellers meant that prices did not rise or fall significantly. It is estimated that foreign firms collected US dollars for October from Mai Jia Li at five yuan two-five, and for November at five yuan one-eight-seven-five. Near noon, American banks and non-bank businesses traded US dollars for September all announced five yuan three-one-two-five. The closing price was three pence five-six-two-five for gold and five yuan three-one-two-five for the US dollar, which was flat for the British pound and longer for the US dollar by zero-three-one-two-five compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Buyers and Sellers Observing the Market in the After-Market</p>
<p>The market was still quiet in the afternoon. It is estimated that speculators sold five yuan three-one-two-five to American banks for this month. Non-bank businesses sold US dollars for the same month for five yuan two-eight-one-two-five to Japanese banks. The closing price at night was three pence five-four-six-eight-seven-five for gold and five yuan two-eight-two-two-five for the US dollar. The prices for this month and the spot price were the same. The price for gold in October was three pence five-one-five-six-two-five, and the price for the US dollar was five yuan two-five, which was zero longer for gold and longer for the US dollar by zero-three-one-two-five compared to the close on Saturday of last week.</p>
<p>The US Dollar in Tianjin was Five Yuan Yesterday</p>
<p>Tianjin, 2nd (Monday) telegram, The exchange market opened flat this morning. The spot prices for both the British pound and the US dollar were each tighter by zero-three-one-two-five. The British pound was three pence three-one-two-five, and the US dollar was exactly five yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by three corners and seven points to one hundred and seven yuan two corners and a half. The black market for "United Notes" was unchanged, still opening at ninety-two yuan six corners and a half.</p>
<h3>Profit-Taking Emerges: Gold Market Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market saw a sluggish and bearish trend, with price increases proving difficult to sustain. Despite fierce competition between buyers and sellers, prices fluctuated around 6,150 yuan. This was mainly due to a slight shift towards bearish sentiment, a stable foreign exchange market, and the re-emergence of rumors about peace. Traders generally sold more than they bought, leading to a price decline. The market opened at 6,160 yuan, and briefly rose by 20 yuan due to initial purchases by securities firms. However, as foreign exchange reports showed stability, gold shops and money changers took profits, causing the price to fall to 6,105 yuan. Subsequently, buying interest waned, leading to mixed price movements. The market closed at only 6,148 yuan at noon. After the close, the market showed slight strength, but sentiment weakened again in the afternoon. Despite continued buying by securities firms, which briefly pushed the price up by more than 10 yuan from 6,150 yuan, gold shops and small money lenders resumed aggressive selling, driving the price down to 6,125 yuan. However, support from retail investors allowed the market to close at 6,155 yuan, a decrease of 55 yuan compared to last Saturday. Total trading volume was approximately 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold prices remained unchanged, while customs gold prices remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Drops 55 Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning, the price per bar (10 taels) initially weakened due to concerns about a strong foreign exchange market. In addition, weekend trading had already been light. Gold shops initially sold 30 taels to silver shops at 6,160 yuan. Subsequently, sudden buying by securities firms briefly triggered a rebound, with securities firms trading among themselves 20 taels at a high of 6,180 yuan. However, as foreign exchange reports continued to show stability, few buyers were willing to pay high prices. Furthermore, many bullish silver and gold shops took profits, and a certain money changer aggressively increased short positions, fueled by some negative news in the market. As a result, the price soon fell by 75 yuan, with money changers selling 20 taels to gold shops, pushing the price down to 6,105 yuan. Fortunately, short sellers covered their positions at the low price, and gold shops reversed their positions, buying instead of selling. The price soon rose again to 6,170 yuan. Later, money changers and others resumed short selling at the high price, and gold shops again sold heavily, causing the price to fall back to 6,105 yuan before the close. However, sentiment improved before the close, and silver shops resumed taking long positions, allowing the market to close at 6,148 yuan. After the close, silver shops continued to buy, with off-market trading reaching 6,170 yuan. Trading opened weakly in the afternoon, with money changers selling 10 taels to gold shops at 6,150 yuan. Subsequently, buying from securities firms and others pushed the price up to 6,165 yuan. However, selling by silver and gold shops made it easier for prices to fall, reaching a low of 6,125 yuan. Later, selling pressure eased, and silver shops began buying, with gold shops also following suit. As a result, the market closed at 6,155 yuan, a decrease of 55 yuan compared to last Saturday. After the close, the market initially strengthened before stabilizing, trading at 6,165 yuan at one point. However, someone was willing to sell at 6,160 yuan at the end. The entire day saw fluctuations of 75 yuan. Current prices at cash shops were more than ten yuan higher than spot prices, while purchase prices were 30 yuan lower. Current gold prices were more than fifty yuan lower than listed prices, with few transactions taking place.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Prices Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold remained unchanged throughout the day. Da Tong Hang continued to list the price at 630 yuan per tael. Xin Tong Hang's prices were similar to the previous day, with purchase prices reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Foreign Exchange Notes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw spot prices decline. Both British and American gold pounds fell by a small amount of one yuan each. There were still a few transactions in British gold notes, and market prices remained stable. American gold notes experienced erratic fluctuations, ultimately falling by a small amount of six cents. Hong Kong notes also fell by one cent. Demand for Japanese gold notes decreased significantly, leading to a sharp drop in market prices. The evening market retreated to 1.675 yuan, a sharp drop of 14.5 cents compared to last Saturday. Korean notes followed the downward trend, retreating to 1.08 yuan in the evening market, also a small drop of six cents compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Food: Inferior Imported Rice Used to Supply the Market</h3>
<p>With ample inventory and supply exceeding demand, the high price of imported rice, which had been artificially inflated, finally met resistance yesterday, despite the support of the Evaluation Committee. However, large merchants and hoarders continued to hold firm, refusing to sell. As a result, yesterday's market price for high-quality imported rice, such as No. 1 Saigon Siam rice, remained at the high level of the previous day, without any reduction. Instead, they sold inferior rice at discounts ranging from 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan, hoping to deceive buyers. Rice merchants are adept at such deceptive tactics. Original bags from the British-Chinese Company have been heavily manipulated by speculators in recent days, who are engaged in so-called "scalping" and "hot potato" tactics. However, actual sales remain sluggish, and large merchants are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Without new hoarding efforts, the market cannot sustain its high prices and inevitably declines. No. 2 Siam rice, which opened at 72.5 yuan per bag including shipping and insurance last Saturday, was only 70.4 yuan yesterday. The price for rice including shipping and insurance was 70 yuan yesterday, compared to the previous opening of 72 yuan. Re-exports were priced at 69 yuan and 68.5 yuan yesterday, a sharp decrease of 2.5 yuan. Small-grain Saigon rice and broken rice remained unsold due to a lack of demand. Total cash rice transactions amounted to 7,000 to 4,000 bags, while original bags accounted for only 360 to 370 tons.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of Japonica and Glutinous domestic rice remained limited, prices had already been driven up sufficiently. As a result, rumors circulated that both official and unofficial markets were following the bearish trend of imported rice. With few transactions, prices fell by one yuan per shi. Changbang white Japonica was priced at 71 yuan, Wuxi Qing Japonica at 70 yuan, and Changzhou Su Kun Japonica ranged from 68-69 yuan for high-quality rice to 66-67 yuan for inferior rice. Nangang original bags of fresh early rice were priced at 69 yuan, and 65-66 yuan per hu. Jinli special-grade glutinous rice was priced at 66-67 yuan, Changdan rice at 64-65 yuan, Hong Kong special-grade glutinous rice at 66-67 yuan, and ordinary glutinous rice at 64-65 yuan. The supply of Zhoupu new Japonica remained limited to 30-40 dan, and prices were affected by other types of rice, falling by 0.5 yuan to open at 66 yuan.</p>
<h3>Newly Arrived American Flour Transferred to Northern and Southern Ports in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>The price for No. 2 flour from the flour mills remained at 15 yuan, with sales mainly concentrated in the local area. The price for No. 1 flour from the flour mills also remained at 15 yuan, with sales mainly concentrated in the local area. As mooncakes became popular, various tea and food shops increased their orders. However, due to transportation difficulties, out-of-town transactions were sluggish, and the market was calm. However, the Phoenix brand of Japanese flour, which is subject to speculative interest, saw prices decline due to a drop in rice prices and a shift towards bearish sentiment, falling by 3-5 cents to 1 dime. Spot flour opened at 14.47 yuan, September flour at 14.85-14.9 yuan, and October flour at 15-15.09 yuan. Only slightly more than 5,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Furthermore, news has emerged that a large quantity of newly arrived American flour from the previous month, such as brands like Pao Tai, Double Eagle, and Rising Sun, has been re-exported to northern and southern ports. The estimated amount is no less than 100,000 bags. As a result, American flour on the local market has become relatively scarce and profitable, with prices reaching 17 yuan. Ordinary grades are priced at 16.4-16.5 yuan, with some local merchants acquiring small quantities.</p>
<p>The wheat market is trending towards a stalemate. Due to a recent reduction in domestic arrivals, flour sales have been relatively active. Various mills appear eager to purchase, and the Fu and Fu mills briefly lowered their prices by 0.5 yuan, purchasing 300-400 bags of wheat from nearby Kunshan and Nanxiang. This has further fueled hoarding by merchants. However, Japanese mills are focusing on purchases, acquiring 2,000-3,000 bags daily at prices around 21 yuan. The market remains difficult to expand.</p>
<h3>Securities: Ample Speculative Funds Make Public Debt Difficult to Sell Short</h3>
<p>The securities gray market saw a sharp rise in the morning, followed by a gradual weakening. It is generally believed that the initial rise was due to the easing of the coastal defense situation, while the subsequent decline was due to rumors about the Shanghai concessions. However, this is not entirely the case. The recent rise in public debt has continued for a week, with prices increasing by 2-3 yuan. This inevitably led to profit-taking by bullish investors, a common tactic among speculators, and has no relation to the overall trend of public debt. Investors are holding firm, and the abundance of speculative funds, as a result of the lack of profitable opportunities in foreign exchange and the excessive rise in gold prices, is a rare phenomenon in recent months. The repeated rise in gold prices, coupled with a decline in premiums, proves the abundance of speculative funds. Public debt is still trading at 523 discount, and investments can still yield more than one point of interest. Political stability and rising market prices are still factors to consider. Therefore, this correction triggered by profit-taking has failed to push down the closing price of the previous day, demonstrating the strength of market sentiment. The market may consolidate for a day or two before reacting to other news and resuming its upward movement. Renchang Xie and Da bought aggressively yesterday morning, while Hong Da, Jiu Feng, Heng Kang, and Zhen Kang also made purchases. Market prices continued to rise, with Class C bonds reaching a high of 3.65 yuan. This triggered profit-taking by bullish investors, with Defu, Tong Kang, Xinfu, Heng Fu, and Datong selling varying amounts. The difference between high and low prices was 0.35 yuan. In the afternoon, Xinfu and Heng Kang sold even more aggressively, and Hong Da also switched to selling. Lianyi also made some sales. It was cheaper to buy Class A bonds and sell Class C bonds at No. 41. Heng Fu initially sold before buying back in, pushing down market prices by a small amount of 0.02-0.03 yuan. However, buying by Lianhe, Jiufeng, Tongkang, Hu Heji, and Le Mao stabilized the market. As a result, with the exception of Class A bonds, which fell slightly by 0.01 yuan, the remaining bonds rose by 0.02-0.075 yuan. Total trading volume was approximately 1.6-1.7 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 30 shares of Ning Shao Shipping Company were traded at a price of 13 yuan per share.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market was booming, thanks to stable political news over the weekend and strong performance in the New York market. Industrial stocks were strong from the beginning, with Jardine Matheson, Ewo, British American Tobacco, and Ye Guang consistently rising. Trading volume was substantial.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks trended downward due to unfavorable news that the transfer of profits from Singapore and Java would be subject to new regulations. It is reported that local agents have telegraphed to inquire about the situation, and it should not be difficult to verify the truth. While Singapore and Java companies should be commended for their efforts in contributing to the war effort, they must fulfill their fair share of responsibilities. However, it is hoped that their contributions will not be as substantial as rumored, as this would significantly reduce the dividends for rubber stocks compared to those paid in 1937 and 1938.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Rumors of Reopening of Shanghai Air Defense Line Boost Yarn Prices - Accumulated Yarn Stocks Remain a Concern</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending upward, with bullish sentiment emerging. However, actual transactions remain mediocre. Speculative sentiment is largely bullish, but in reality, it is driven by short-term profit-taking. However, rumors are circulating that the Shanghai air defense transportation line will be reopened, which has fueled speculative buying and pushed up the market. However, accumulated yarn stocks have exceeded 300,000 bales and continue to rise.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened with a peaceful atmosphere, with 20-count Double Horse yarn priced at 972 yuan. This was due to a stable foreign exchange market, calm gold prices, and peaceful sentiment. However, sudden rumors of the reopening of coastal defense transportation lines caused a surge in speculative buying, pushing the market gradually up to 994 yuan. At this point, some leveraged bulls sold their positions, causing the market to fall back to 988 yuan at closing. Total daytime trading volume was 2,935 bales, with Double Horse yarn rising by 18 yuan. Yong'an Factory offered 700 bales of 20-count special Jincheng yarn at a price of 950 yuan, which was sold out in one week. The amounts purchased by various groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Traders: 2,375 bales Hong Kong: 535 bales</p>
<p>Domestic: 70 bales Total: 2,935 bales</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton Trading Active</p>
<p>Spot cotton trading remains subdued, with limited demand from factories. Shenxin has made some minor purchases, but they are only a small addition. Therefore, there have been no significant price changes.</p>
<p>Pengjiapu: 210.00 Shenxin Purchase: 200 bales</p>
<p>Huo Ji Hua: 154.50 Trader Purchase: 240 bales</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji: 205.00 Also: 209.00 Also: 130 bales</p>
<p>In other news, New York cotton futures closed higher by 2-3 points due to a lack of sellers and improved stock prices on Wall Street, as well as purchases by some traders. Indian cotton rose by more than 2 rupees, including forecasts.</p>
<p>Trading in imported cotton in Shanghai has been relatively active in recent days. Inventory is declining, and there has been strong demand for long-staple cotton. As a result, trading in Brazilian cotton has been very active. However, the market is facing a shortage of long-staple cotton, and traders who have stocks of this type of cotton are currently reluctant to sell.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Market Transportation Resumes; Shortages Push Up Prices</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The market trend was slightly firmer yesterday, as transportation to Hong Kong resumed and freight transportation along the Shanghai-Ningbo line increased. The outflow of goods from Shanghai has become slightly more active, and confidence is growing. Prices for some short-supplied goods have increased by around 0.25 yuan per piece. Over 500 pieces of gray fabric were traded on the local market. Traders from Hong Kong purchased 200 pieces of bleached, dyed, and printed twill and coarse cloth. Traders from Zhejiang and Fujian continued to make sporadic purchases. Traders from Yunnan purchased 200 pieces of blue cloth. Merchants from Singapore and Siam purchased over 4,000 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. Traders from the northern route of Yantai purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, flannel, and wool cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, merchants from the northern route of Yantai purchased 300-400 bales of fine cloth such as colored balls. Due to seasonal factors, the demand for mid- and low-grade fine cloth has been gradually increasing in the local dyeing market, and the market atmosphere has become tighter. The trading of Longtou fine cloth has been particularly active since the market opened after the holidays, with the afternoon closing price at 32.75 yuan. Sijunzi Serge was priced at 0.93625 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Crude Oil Rises Again; Reports of Peanut Flooding</h3>
<p>The soybean oil and peanut oil market saw prices rise due to reports that peanut production areas had been affected by flooding. Some owners secretly took long positions, creating an optimistic atmosphere. There were more buyers than sellers in the market, and prices tightened again by 0.5-1.5 yuan. A total of 30 pieces of crude Jiaozhou oil were traded at 64 yuan, and 1,150 pieces were ordered for delivery from the first half of September to the second half of October at 62-63 yuan. 100 pieces of crude Yantai oil were traded at 62.5 yuan, and 230 barrels of crude Qingdao oil were traded at 89.5-88.5 yuan, with 170 barrels ordered for delivery from the second half of September to the first half of October at 88.5-87.5 yuan. In addition, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 69 yuan, 50 pieces of Qingdao soybean oil at 70 yuan, 100 pieces of Yantai soybean oil at 70 yuan, 80 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at 98.5-97 yuan, and 200 dan from Dayouyu Factory at 76.5-75 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, 350 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Tianjin today.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Diao Qing Rises by One Yuan</h3>
<p>The sugar market was flat yesterday, with limited trading. The Association's settlement price for current spot goods was 77.5 yuan for No. 24 coarse white sugar from foreign warehouses, and 76 yuan for March old goods. Taikoo car white B mark was slightly tighter at 77 yuan, DY mark was 73.5 yuan for September delivery, and Dutch red was 63 yuan for goods arriving on September 17. The accumulation of domestic Diao Qing sugar has been increasing, and Jianbang opened with 131 bags at 66 yuan, a rise of one yuan. It is reported that production prices are also tight, and there is currently a lack of arrivals, suggesting that the market may need to consolidate again in the future.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Hainan Dried Longan Expected to Rise</h3>
<p>The price of Hainan dried longan has fallen repeatedly since the arrival of new crops due to abundant supply, falling by more than 35% compared to the initial market. According to letters from customers, production prices have tightened, and prices are expected to rebound by 10-20 yuan. Therefore, it is expected that prices will rebound in the official market today.</p>
<h3>Coal: Limited Outlets for Bituminous Coal Dust</h3>
<p>Bituminous coal dust has seen limited demand recently as most factories in the city have suspended operations. Public bathhouses and tiger stoves also have access to discounted coal dust, making business difficult for local coal dealers. As a result, prices have struggled to rise. The price for Kai Ping No. 2 dust is 125 yuan per ton, Keelung dust 110 yuan, and bituminous coal dust 112 yuan. These prices are all wholesale prices for fellow dealers, with a small markup added when delivered to customers.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Black Tea Firm, Green Tea Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, local firms such as Hong Lai and Jin Long Haoshi Men continued to purchase black tea. However, due to limited raw material inventory and insufficient supply, the market trended upward. The green tea market remained sluggish, with the export market to the United States still intermittent. The total volume of black and green tea traded throughout the city was just over 260 boxes. Black tea was sold at 285 yuan and shrimp eyes at 270 yuan. Black tea appeared to be performing better than green tea. The hardware trade has suffered significant losses in the past two days due to rain. The Benchang nails and other iron products purchased by Yantai merchants have been unable to ship out due to the continuous autumn rains. In addition, the goods ordered by local merchants have not been loaded onto vehicles. The imported nail market was initially sluggish, but has seen renewed activity in the past day or two due to purchases by Yantai merchants, with prices gradually rising. The current price for Bess nails is 48 yuan per barrel. It is reported that 600-700 barrels have been traded in the past two days. As a result, the new market is also seeing increased prices. Certain nail factories have been actively purchasing raw materials in anticipation of increased demand after the autumn season. Although there is a large inventory of Benchang nails in Shanghai, a strong sales performance would inevitably lead to a shortage, so they are taking this opportunity to acquire raw materials, causing new market prices to rise to around 50 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Herbs: Clove Market Stable</h3>
<p>Arrivals of cloves have been steady recently, gradually creating a situation of oversupply. The previous market price was 420 yuan. While merchants are asking for the original price for newly arrived goods, various firms are taking a wait-and-see approach and making few purchases. It is rumored that the price has fallen by a small amount of 10 yuan, but no transactions have been made.</p>
<h3>Knitwear: New Sanitary Shirts and Pants</h3>
<p>As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, sanitary shirts and pants have been launched on the market and are being purchased by out-of-town merchants. However, due to increased raw material costs and manufacturing expenses, prices are 40-50% higher than in previous autumns. For example, the Zhongshi Luoxiu colored men's shirt (No. 320) produced by Wuhe Factory, which previously sold for around 20-30 yuan per dozen, is now selling for 54.5 yuan. The Jizi (No. 200) free-collar men's shirt produced by Zhenfeng Factory, which previously sold for 24-25 yuan per dozen, is now selling for 54.5 yuan for colored shirts and 57 yuan for all-white shirts. Prices for cotton-wool shirts and pants and woolen gloves have also increased.</p>

<h3>Opening and Closing of City Gates</h3>
<p>Liu, Acting Provincial Administration Commissioner of Jiangsu Province, hereby issues a public notice: Shanghai is a district where people from all corners gather, and merchants are concentrated, making it easy for criminals to mingle. The opening and closing of the city gates, established for the purpose of local defense, are set at fixed times. However, due to interactions with foreigners, there are often instances of people entering and exiting the city late at night. Therefore, various government offices have established counter-tokens. Even commissioners are allowed to apply for a permit to open the city gates when they have official business. Currently, due to local unrest, strict inspections should be enforced. In the future, all city gates must be opened and closed on time. Except for counter-tokens and permits, no one shall be allowed to pass through. If there are urgent official documents from outside that cannot wait until the next day, the city defense officers shall send someone to accompany the messenger in order to ensure caution. In addition to instructing the Right Battalion to relay these instructions to all city gate officers for compliance, and ordering all commissioners to conduct strict inspections at all times, this public notice is hereby issued. All soldiers and civilians are hereby ordered to comply and not violate these special instructions!</p>
<p>Reconstruction of Memorial Arch</p>
<p>Behind the screen wall of the Shanghai County Government Office, there is a stone memorial archway dedicated to Xu Wending, a former prime minister of the Ming Dynasty. Due to years of disrepair, it is in a state of damage. This year, the area was affected by a fire, and the stone beams were burned, with temporary wooden pillars used as support. However, this area is a thoroughfare, and any unforeseen circumstances would have significant implications. His descendants have gathered and agreed that the matter concerns their ancestors and must be addressed as soon as possible. They are currently planning to assess the wealth of each clan and collect donations to rebuild the archway.</p>

<h3>Churchill and Cigars</h3>
<p>– Xiao Yun</p>
<p>On August 30, the Associated Press published a short piece of European war news in Western newspapers, stating that British Prime Minister Churchill, while inspecting an airfield on the southern coast of England the day before, happened to be attacked by German aircraft. As Churchill was about to enter an air-raid shelter, he habitually lit his usual large cigar. The local mayor saw this and rushed forward to stop him, saying, "Sir, smoking is prohibited here."</p>
<p>"Alright," Churchill replied, stubbing out the cigar under his foot and saying lightly, "A good cigar wasted."</p>
<p>Although this is a minor incident, it contains considerable meaning and lessons. This story demonstrates the British spirit of public service and law-abidingness. Even high-ranking officials can humbly obey public regulations, without looking down on the advisor because of their lower status, or becoming embarrassed and angry at being reprimanded by a subordinate.</p>
<p>Although this spirit of public service and law-abidingness is taken for granted, it requires considerable cultivation and a sense of humor.</p>
<p>Personalities</p>
<h3>Past Events</h3>
<p>– Huan Jun</p>
<p>The burden of life has pressed down so heavily that my father, already in his sixties with white hair, has to go out to work every day, preventing him from resting for a few years. This makes me, as his son, truly feel uneasy.</p>
<p>Every evening, my father returns wearily, the wrinkles on his kind face seeming to deepen every day. As he drags his heavy steps past me, and I look at his stooped back, he seems much older than before, and I can't help but sigh deeply, my heart breaking.</p>
<p>My father's profession is indeed noble and difficult. Every day, he strains his throat and shouts with all his might, his face turning red with bulging veins, while the reward he receives is truly meager. But he is not discouraged or complaining, as if he lives for education.</p>
<p>Late at night, people have long gone to pursue their sweet dreams in comfort, but my father cannot sleep. He has to grade the students' compositions. My father is sloppy about anything, but when it comes to grading compositions, he is never vague. He can grade two or three books an hour if they are quick, but when the writing is poor and incomprehensible, he cannot grade one book in an hour. This is hard on the old man, who rarely gets a full night's sleep all year round. Sometimes I wake up to find my father still sitting stiffly under the dim light, working. I really can't stand it and can't help but say a few words: "Father! You should save some energy. Isn't it faster to just grade them casually? Even if the students have a day of success in the future, they won't necessarily remember your kindness."</p>
<p>"I don't think so. I have been a teacher for more than 30 years and have never neglected my duty for a single day. It seems that education is my second life. Unless I am dead, then I have to give up everything; otherwise, as long as I exist, I will do my best to fulfill my duties."</p>
<p>No one can deny what my father said, but I can't bear to see him keep doing this.</p>
<p>"Yes, Father! We should do that... but you are already old and can't do what young people can do. You have to take care of yourself."</p>
<p>My father's expression didn't change at all. He still said in a firm tone: "Indeed, I feel that my physical strength is declining, and my spirit is far from what it used to be. Sitting for too long will make my whole body ache; but I still have to hold on to these old bones, even if it exhausts my energy. I will never sell my conscience and do something that would mislead other people's children."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he continued to bury himself in work, as if he wanted to squeeze out all his brainpower to grade the students' compositions as thoroughly and carefully as possible, deliberating almost every word and every sentence, and never letting anything go lightly.</p>
<p>Looking at my father like this, and at the thick stack of papers on the table, I felt a surge of sadness and couldn't help but cry under my quilt.</p>
<p>My father taught for more than 30 years, and there must have been at least two or three thousand students. Now that my father has been dead for six years, who among those who have been taught by him can still remember the kind and dedicated teacher who once loved them?</p>

<h3>News Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Historical Talk</p>
<p>Reading German war reports, no matter which photograph or anecdote, the signature P.K. is always affixed below; what does that mean? I suspect very few people know. In fact, that is the abbreviation for "Propaganda Troops."</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of this European war, front-line reports signed P.K. have been continuously sent back to Germany. For the German people, this has become the sole symbol of battlefield realism. Why? Because reports signed P.K. are by no means desk-bound creations. At the same time, photos marked with the two letters P.K. are definitely not forgeries retrieved from photo albums. P.K.'s works are produced amidst the war. The person writing this news is neither a journalist of the past nor a photojournalist. They are soldiers, just like their comrades fighting on the battlefield. It is not inappropriate to call them news soldiers.</p>
<p>The mission of these "news soldiers" is to enable diligent farmers, housewives, teachers, laborers, salaried workers, etc., in the rear to directly and concretely understand how their sons or brothers are struggling in hardship, thereby gaining their empathy and completing the nation's total war effort. Therefore, the members of P.K. all feel that they bear the aforementioned heavy responsibility.</p>
<p>In every combat unit, there are bound to be some propaganda troops assigned. Even in the navy, any small submarine has propaganda troops on board. They exist in the units that are attacking Paris with surprising mechanical speed, they also act in concert with the heavy artillery units that break through the strong Liège fortress, they also lurk in the submarines attacking British naval ports, and they also ride in the planes bombing London and Fada. Braving the danger of pursuer planes and anti-aircraft guns, they inspect the appearance of battle and disseminate their country's soldiers' experiences to the rear and the people. This kind of work is completely different in nature from the momentary front-line visits of military journalists from newspapers. Even if they come to the front line, newspaper reporters customarily produce those things imaginatively at the desk of the headquarters, with their backs to a warm stove. The work of the German P.K. troops cannot be mentioned in the same breath.</p>
<p>Today, the German propaganda troops, in essence, are a group of soldiers. They are no longer like the battlefield correspondents of the past, who were employees of a newspaper or publishing house. They do not work for employers, nor do they receive compensation from employers. They work for the country. They do not write articles or take photos for money. They are purely soldiers. Therefore, their works are not provided to newspapers or publishing houses but are sent to the Central Affairs Bureau. The Central Affairs Bureau then distinguishes the nature of various materials and distributes them to research institutions or uses them for proper propaganda. At the same time, they are also sent to newspapers and government authorities in neutral countries.</p>
<p>The origins of P.K. members are almost entirely journalists and news photographers with military status. From the perspective of their professional talents, they are of course able to handle the mission they bear with ease.</p>
<h3>Plant Infectious Diseases</h3>
<p>— Chemical Times</p>
<p>There is a kind of plant, such as potatoes, tobacco, etc., that often develops an obvious disease with tan and white spots on the leaves that resemble patterns. This disease is called "Mosaic" and is infectious. Someone transplanted a diseased young sprout onto another plant, and that plant also contracted the same disease. The juice from the diseased plant was squeezed out and applied to another plant. After an incubation period of six to fifteen days, this plant also contracted the disease. Some people say this is a bacterial disease, but no organic microorganisms can be found. The juice from the diseased plant remains toxic even after clarification.</p>
<p>The American Tang Lai, after four years of effort, discovered a liquid in the diseased plant that has properties like protein and can become crystalline. Therefore, people know that this is not a living organism. One eight-hundred-thousandth of a gram of this liquid in a tobacco plant will also cause the disease after a few days, and it can be endlessly transmitted to other plants.</p>
<p>Today, some people believe that plant infectious diseases are caused by a kind of fermentative substance, but most people say it is the effect of microfungi. If heat or preservatives (such as gasifiers) are used, this source of disease can be eliminated. This has become an indistinguishable boundary between living and non-living things, which is very worthy of biologists, doctors, and bacteriologists to manipulate.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Dangerous Experience</p>
<p>Hawthorne rested his right leg on his left knee, leaned back in his chair, and exhaled another puff of smoke before speaking. He said slowly, "My experience, if you want to add any comment, can be said to be dangerous, coincidental, and a failure."</p>
<p>I said impatiently, "Don't be headless. Explain it clearly."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou also nodded secretly there, clearly expressing extreme agreement with my rebuke of Hawthorne.</p>
<p>Hawthorne smiled slightly and began to say, "Okay, I will speak with a head and a tail. After you followed Yu Gantang into the elevator, I continued to talk with Brother Jinshou for about two or three minutes, and then this mess happened—Bao Lang, you also have to take some responsibility for this matter. You wanted to listen to my conversation, didn't you open the glass door of the telephone room? Therefore, the sound of my conversation was transmitted outside. Inadvertently, I suddenly saw a person suddenly squatting down in that aisle, quickly raising his right hand close to his chest. Bao Lang, you always know this is the most accurate posture for firing a gun.—"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou asked anxiously, "Then, did you see him firing the gun?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne shook his head. "No, I only saw that person in this posture. I hurriedly bent my knees and squatted straight down. With a bang, the bullet had penetrated the glass. The telephone receiver in my hand naturally slipped. There was only one shot, and he probably thought I had been hit. In fact, if his aim had been half an inch lower, or if my movement at that time had been half a second slower, I would probably be going to that not-so-interesting place at this moment, accompanying the dance queen to wait for Dr. Bai!"</p>
<p>I saw Ni Jinshou staring at Hawthorne without blinking. The muscles on his face seemed to be threaded with iron wires. Although I didn't have a mirror myself, my expression must not be far from Ni Jinshou's. But Hawthorne was still calm as usual, as if what he was talking about was not his own experience, but some kind of "Qi Dong Ye Yu" style story. I urged, "Did you see the person who fired the gun? Who?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne exhaled another long strand of smoke. "Don't be impatient. This is the danger. Now let's talk about the coincidence. This coincidence is divided into two points; first, the person who fired the gun was also encountered inadvertently. Bao Lang, do you remember when we were talking to the No. 71 room attendant on the seventh floor of the Asia East, there was a grand and pretentious bureaucrat-type guy with glasses approaching us from the east end of the aisle?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Very clear. That guy was very tall, wearing a dark blue robe, a brown felt hat, and had some short whiskers on his lips." (95)</p>

<h3>Solitary Island Drama Talk</h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>Gai Jiaotian is Old but Vigorous</p>
<p>After Tan Fuying and Chen Lifang's contracts expired, the Xin Xin Stage invited famous actors Gai Jiaotian and Shen Manhua to perform. The reporter went to see a performance on the 29th of last month. When they arrived at the theater, "Catching and Releasing Cao" was being performed on stage. The person playing Chen Gong was Gao Xing'an, who was actually Gao Jingmin, who had previously performed at the Tianchan Theater. He was full of sheepishness and had a poor voice, so there was nothing brilliant to say. After "Catching and Releasing Cao", there was Shen Manhua's "Yu Tang Chun". Shen is a proud disciple of the famous actor Jiang Miaoxiang. She comes from the old capital and has quite good skills. In general, Manhua's art is actually above Zhang Junqiu and Chen Lifang's generation. Only Manhua is a</p>
<p>True and Correct Qingyi</p>
<p>Her repertoire may not be as extensive as that of Junqiu and Lifang. However, since Chen Delin and Wu Caixia, there have been few talents in Liyuan who are true and correct Qingyi. Manhua's true and correct Qingyi can also be said to be a rare find. Her singing and recitation in "Yu Tang Chun" performed that day were excellent, and her tunes all follow Mei. Manhua once received guidance from Lanfang. When singing the "Huilong Tune" of "My Lord," Manhua supported herself on the ground with one hand, creating a beautiful figure that other actors do not have. After the trial was over, when Su San stood up, she used her hands to support her legs, feigning soreness, which was a bit too much. Judging by intent, Manhua may be able to sing but not act, but her appearance is not unpleasant either. The main show was Gai Jiaotian's "Evil Tiger Village". In recent years, Gai has performed five dramas, each with a</p>
<p>Lonely Peony Regret. This time, Xin Xin invited Gai to perform, borrowing the painted face Wang Fusheng from the Gong Stage and the spoken jump Xu Youtian from the Carlton. These two are both good at performing martial arts dramas. One played Wu Tianqiu and the other played Wang Liang that day, maximizing the beauty of the green leaves of the peony, adding a lot of color to the whole drama. Gai Jiaotian is old but vigorous, and his hands and feet are as agile as before. The whole drama is full of highlights. The most attractive ones are: (1) A small round arena when he comes out of Evil Tiger Village and pulls the horse back to the shop. His body matches the gong and drum beats perfectly, which is very good to look at; (2) When walking on the edge, he recites the four sentences "Benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trust are supreme," first using "Luodi Thirteen," followed by two consecutive "flying kicks," which are neat and tidy, and wonderful to the extreme; (3) The scene of snatching the knife during the fight, and fighting against his opponent, is seamlessly connected.</p>
<p>Perfectly seamless</p>
<p>In addition, such as "Falling Luan Belt", "Showing the Bottom of the Shoes" and the "Appearances" when going up and down the stage, there are minor beauties. Nowadays, when people watch dramas, they often like to use "Beijing Style" and "Shanghai Style" as a basis. Seeing Gai Jiaotian, there is no need to make a distinction between Beijing and Shanghai styles. In fact, among the martial arts students in the old capital today, there is no one who can match Gai Jiaotian's skills. Gai Jiaotian truly raised the eyebrows and exhaled for the actors in Jiangnan.</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Love and Death"</h3>
<p>— Mu Tao</p>
<p>Li Xiaqing Guest Stars as Aviator</p>
<p>In the profit-oriented Hollywood companies, they often rely on special occasions to make certain films in order to achieve business purposes. This film, "Love and Death", uses the story of an American woman who grew up in China and became a Chinese citizen falling in love with a foreign man, inserts a stubborn medical professor, and then uses some opportunities of the Chinese war of resistance to form it. There is nothing wonderful in the content, and there is a lack of justice in the meaning, so the value of this film is not as high as ideal.</p>
<p>Although, the technique of this film is quite weak. The director is Frank Bouchage, who directed "Till We Meet Again", "Green Jade", etc. His skills are brisk and powerful, fluent and profound, and can give people an indelible impression. Therefore, half of the success of this film must be attributed to the director. The most exciting parts of the film are several surgery scenes. The director uses the expressions on each person's face, the sound of the clock, and the blood transfusion shots to strengthen the tension in the air, which can be considered a slight success. Other aspects, such as introducing Andre's appearance, depicting Dr. Forster's harsh nature, and the progress of Andre and John's romance, also have wonderful techniques. However, the scene at the end where John is seriously injured by bullets in China has been cut out due to location and time constraints, so after John saves a Chinese refugee child, it is followed by the scene where Dr. Forster receives a letter about John's injury, which inevitably makes the audience somewhat confused and also weakens the power of the final climax.</p>
<p>Loretta Young plays Andre, a Chinese woman, and there are not many scenes, but she fits the personality quite well. She speaks five or six sentences in Chinese, which are still audible, but there is always a bit of a foreign accent, which is not very pleasant to the ear. The several sets of Chinese clothes she wears are also very different from the qipaos of modern Chinese girls today. Akim Tamiroff plays Dr. Forster, and his acting is skilled and can be called a success. John Howard plays John, and although the role is competent, he lacks facial expressions and has no wonderful achievements.</p>
<p>Li Xiaqing, a Chinese female aviator who guest stars in this film, also plays a female pilot, and there is only one shot where she only says one sentence in Chinese. In a music short film before the main film, American famous singers Les Hitester, etc. sing popular songs, which are very pleasant to listen to and worth watching.</p>
<h3>"Experimental" Concert</h3>
<p>— Tan Fu</p>
<p>The Experimental Music Society's third and fourth concerts will be held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 9 pm on the 5th and 6th. This time, the choir participating in the performance has about forty or fifty people. They will sing more than twenty works from seven countries, including Farmer's Song, National Song, Iron Refining, and Spring News. The conductor is Mr. Chen Gexin. In addition to the choir program, there will also be orchestral ensemble and accompaniment, violin solos, and bass and soprano solos.</p>
<p>The programs for these two concerts are arranged differently; some songs are repeated, and some can only be heard once. Captain's Song, Farmer's Song, Fire Plow March, National March, Golden Floating Clouds, Shepherdess's Song, Firefly, and Lullaby will all only appear once, and it is said that after this time, the program will be completely replaced with new ones.</p>
<p>The Shanghai music scene is quite lonely. "Shiyin's" move is, of course, something that must be introduced to every music lover.</p>
<p>After "Love's First Dream", "Kirin's First Dream", "Kirin Sending a Son" and "Little Baby", the Universal child star Babe Santhie has completed "Little Sister", which is scheduled to be released at the Cathay on the 4th of this month.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in San Francisco Build a New Radio Station</h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>American residents in San Francisco have recently often received a strange singing music and speeches when listening to wireless broadcasts. They cannot understand these programs and are all speculating about this strange broadcast sound.</p>
<p>It turns out that overseas Chinese in San Francisco have built a radio station, call sign KSAN, broadcasting various programs every night. According to Mr. Dong (Mr-Sam S.S. Tong), the program director of the station, Chinese and American businessmen have shown great interest in the station's broadcast programs, and the past results have been very satisfactory.</p>
<p>The 20,000 overseas Chinese currently residing in San Francisco and the thousands of overseas Chinese in central California are very happy to listen. In addition, overseas Chinese in Los Angeles, Salt Lake City, Chicago, and the east coast of the United States can also listen to these Chinese music and speeches to slightly relieve their deep longing for their motherland.</p>
