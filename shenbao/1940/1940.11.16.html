<h3 id="c10">二屆安全運動 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>去年六月間，上海租界內舉行安全運動，在運動期內，成效卓著；及今一年有餘，又將二屆舉行矣。回念平時一般情狀，行車秩序未見整飾；更玫之車輛肇事死亡統計，二十年來，卻以去年爲最多。因綠不一，事非偶然，若謂因安全運動而反使車輛肇禍趨增，則理所必無者也。玫肇禍責任。初非盡在車輛；如路上行人，往往站立於人行道外，馬路之間，雖車輛銜接並駛而來，仍思乘隙穿越馬路；亦有不待綠燈開放，冒險搶越而過；試問如此行路，設有不幸，其誰之咎；駕車者如爲避免碰撞不守路章之行人，以致肇禍，則又將責歸誰屬；故欲求行路之安全，似應由駕車與行人各守規律，則禍自减少矣。但就人力車夫乃至汽車夫言之，小心翼翼者固多，率意妄行者猶不少，越車而前，掠駛而過，行人之利害危險不計也。亦有不待鳴號，而汽車已駛至身前。或有數車並行，而撞跌不顧；磕碰不問。於是而乘車者危矣，行路者險矣，抑御車者亦寗有幸理。大槪車夫之敢於橫衝直撞，必有所挾持，或恃其胆大，或逞其術强，或挾車主之聲勢，或蔑視人命之安全，故於車夫領照之際，自應就其所應守所應知所應爲者加以考騐，固不論其爲汽車夫與人力車夫也。至於肇事之車夫，尤應嚴申懲罰，俾知儆戒。迺者常聞公共汽車與電車之肇禍；而電車之肇禍，輒聞爲不待乘客上下完畢而開車所致，慘死車下，此其罪責攸歸，實　無可曲宥。至於公共汽車，往昔嘗有良好之規範，逢站必停，停則司車啓門下車，站於車旁，以待上下完畢，而後上車閉門，打鈴開車，兼以維持上下秩序；而今亦日久懈怠，不復多見，於以知紀律之養成難破壞易，良可惜也。</p>
<p>租界內人口日繁，交通工具亦愈進步而複雜；如因各商店電話送貨之風氣盛行，及特種情况之下，竟有爲轉運長途貨物之工具，於是自由車盛極一時，但見雙輪如飛，往來如梭；此亦足爲肇禍增加之原因；蓋駕車者往往貪圖迅速，恃其車輛輕巧，常於各車之間，突飛疾駛而過，驀不及防，有爲之撞倒者矣，煞車不及，有人隨車翻者矣，此外如各式貨車之擁擠於途，若北京路之車輛雜　；及遠過於車身闊度之裝載，蹣跚於馬路之間，設無疏洩整理之方，均足爲不安全之種因。至於停車地點，其在行人車輛殷繁之馬路，自應以不許路旁停車爲原則；即較冷靜地方，亦以無妨行走爲原則，今則未見盡然。車停自不致肇禍，然通路因此而窄，亦足間接增加肇禍機會；如何嚴格取締，是責在警務當局矣。</p>
<p>安全運動之最大目的，爲行車安全，爲行路安全。行車者苟知以人命爲重，決不至輕率疏忽，蓋誰無骨肉，誰無戚友，設其骨肉戚友，有一爲車輛所死傷。彼其內心之怨恚如何？則以死傷加諸人者，能獨無內疚於心，而不思預事避免乎？抑行路者亦何惜數秒之光陰，輕嘗虎口，急於穿越，而忘其身體之可貴，死傷之可痛；若乃出其不備，使不及讓，是則咎不在車矣。故安全運動之對象，不限於駕車者，而實爲全市市民，誠市民普遍注意於此運動，則運動必有宏效可覩矣。</p>

<h3 id="c28">歐戰痛史（三）　法國悲劇中三主角　（一）外强中乾的達拉第 <a href="#c28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>現在我且把戰時的達拉第，介紹於讀者。十月十六日，星期一傍午，我在比京白魯賽爾法國大使館中。這時歐戰發生已有六個月之久了。達拉第集權一身，大有獨裁作風。他一身兼三要職，听有閣員都聽命於他。我之往白魯塞爾，是要完成一個我認爲很重要的使命。現在追念往事，覺得那件事比較當時所感覺者尤爲重要。如果那時達拉第根據我所獲得的結果，好好做去，那末一九四〇年五月德軍不致就能猛攻比利時和荷蘭，而令法國與西歐受到災禍。我並沒有把在歐活動情形告知法國駐比大使，但是他知道必要時一定能替我效勞。</p>
<p>我說：「請趕快把巴黎的電話接給我」。</p>
<p>駐比大使道：「好罷，我來接給你。你要和巴黎那一位談話呢」？</p>
<p>「達拉第總埋」。</p>
<p>大使吃驚道：「你沒有弄錯一定司以我得到他麼」？</p>
<p>我纔明白，由那時駐比大使看來，達拉第是一位不易得見的神秘人物呢。</p>
<p>在我們等待電話找接之間，大使警告我道：「談話時務請妥愼。電話錢上常有人在竊聽，一不留意，消息走漏，後患不堪」。</p>
<p>電話鈴響了，我握起聽筒</p>
<p>「喂，是你麼，裘羅曼？你現在那里呢」？</p>
<p>「在白魯塞爾法大使館中。現有十分重要之事，須於明天面談，請你抽空接見。」</p>
<p>「你看三點鐘好麼」？</p>
<p>「我非得到明天早上纔能乘快車動身。時間一定會弄得很遲」。</p>
<p>「請等一等。那末五點鐘好不好」？</p>
<p>「很好。但是你能準五時接見我麼，因爲就目下局勢而論，我非得要在當晚搭夜車返白魯塞爾呢」。</p>
<p>「好，我一定設法罷」。</p>
<p>我在火車上把預備與達拉第見面時所講的話，一再思索。我要在五分鐘之內獲得他最後的決定。我六天以來與比利時當局的奮鬥精力，至此尚覺餘勇可賈。</p>
<p>開戰之後，凡曾與達拉第接觸的都道：「達拉第念頭太多，任何事件都不能　得决斷。而且和他談話愈弄愈難。卽使在五分鐘的晤談，少不得要弄得你莫衷一是，而他則狐疑更深」。</p>
<p>五時略過幾分鐘，我由人陪人達拉第的辦公室。我也來不及和他寒暄，或朝他看。可是我注意到他的臉很紅，眼睛沒有神。</p>
<p>我說：「你當已知道，我方從白魯塞爾抵此。在那里連續不斷地工作了六天—許多事情都很繁重的—現在我要把結果告訴你，就我看起來，關係綦重，在一星期前，我們連想也不敢想的。我在忽促之中急迫的講了幾句，把大要提了一提。我又接着說：「但是，我們現在務須從速把這件事辦妥。這是斯巴克君（比利時外交部長）和我商定的計劃。請你親筆寫一封致比王的信交我帶去一。</p>
<p>達拉第朝我　　着，滿腹疑惑地對我說道：「寫信給比王麼」？</p>
<p>我回答說：「是呀，斯巴克君和我甚至把信中的措詞都巳商妥。我們已經獲得比王的准許；一切都已準備。今晚我就要返回比京，明天覲見比王呈遞此書。他的復書將由我携回。嗣後他們的言語就一切具有担保了」。</p>
<p>達拉第的表示眞是不可思議，而且近於冷酷。最初他說了此掃興的話，意思要叫我知道，我上面所講到的結果，並不像我所想像到的那樣車要，——達拉第以爲這種結果早經存在——而且很明顯。</p>
<p>我如受到晴天霹靂一般。除了我本人之外，沒有人能了解那時候的眞正局勢，也沒有人能體會釗我在比利時六天奔走前後比國政府的一般態度。我對於躬自身歷的各種困難，知道得太詳細了，我還能回想到當時與斯巴克談話時的情景。比利時要求於危急時，能獲得英法在機械方面的帮助，斯巴克於談到這點時，滿面惶恐之色，至今仍繫繞腦際。達拉第如此的不近人情，眞使我莫明其妙。他對於我在這六天之中，獲得這樣多的情報，打破各種的困難，竟一字不提，連問多不問一聲。他巳表示沒有工夫來聽我的話。而且更令人難堪的，當我要想以三言兩語，對一般局勢，略作解釋時，他總搶在我的前，先行解釋。我私忖，這分明是他要給我一個證據，表示他的消息比我　通，所知道的比我還廣哩。我不免想起拙作「善意之人」中的梅高生和威廉二世了。</p>
<p>但我決不因這些小節而灰心。我再鼓起勇氣。說道：「無論如何，我總得帶了大札今晚返回比京」。</p>
<p>達拉第回答道：「今晚是來不及了。我與甘茂林將共同工作至午夜始已」。</p>
<p>我道：「如果你能答應，我就到隔室去。把那信稿草擬起來，內容如何，我們早經商定。你親筆抄寫簽名，所費不過五分鐘罷了」。</p>
<p>他搖着頭說：「不：第一因爲我不能直接寫信給比王」</p>
<p>「爲什麼不能呢」？</p>
<p>「因爲我並非一國元首。惟有勒勃倫總統纔能寫這封信。你想這事情多麼麻煩」。</p>
<p>「但是總理呀，我　有懇求你了！要知道這是在戰爭期中，也許下星期比利時和荷蘭就要遭人攻擊，這是一件重要緊　的事，這時候你再要講繁文縟節，可再有什麼良好的方策？而且比王已經批准此舉！除了本人之外，誰還來講究這一點」。</p>
<p>「好吧！讓我再考慮一下子罷」。</p>
<p>當他送我至辦公室門口時，遲緩躊躇，顯然帶些憎厭的樣子，我想還是奉承他發句的好，我道；「比王還是個靑年入呢，他對閣下頃揚備至」。</p>
<p>「我知道，我知道」，原來達拉　心中對於道些事都老早知道了呢！</p>

<p>國民敎育</p>
<p>本省之初等敎育、前年及去年悉照戰前部定計劃積極推行、義務敎育、自去冬中央頒布縣各級組織綱要及其實施辦法以後、本省首先將普通小學及戰時國民學校、改辦中心畢校或國民學校、而實施國民學校、本年二月通令各縣開始改制、並訂定改辦要點令發施行、本省原計劃使十二萬之學齡兒童四十九萬六千之失學兒童、及四萬之男女成人、於五年內全部入學、並由各縣區分期强迫、我們現在再就最近各縣所報設立校數、則全省已設立中心學校、共有一千零八十七校、原計劃本年應設校數爲一千校、超過了八十七校、國民學校共有三千八百九十九校、此項差額、多因本年預算確定稍遲、致未能於春季開學時設立、惟一部份縣份、已於秋季開學時補設、因未呈據報、所以沒有計入、至於卅年的實施計劃、已決定先完成每鄕鎭—中心學校、全縣國民學校校數已超過三保一校、的暫設置、未達三保一校的應完成三保一校、計需增設中心學校四三四校、國民學校一二七校、使全省達到中心學校一四三〇校、國民學校四三九四校、尤堪注意的、卽此後國民敎育之設施、更注意於地方與人口學校分佈的均勻、</p>
<p>社會敎育</p>
<p>本省自本年起己將失學之成人及婦女補習敎育、併入國民敎育統一實施、近來敎育部對於國民體育·岡書館敎育戲劇音樂·電化敎育等甚爲注意、本省體此意旨、通令各縣遍設體育塲與圖書館、在福建省敎育五年計劃中、亦已其體擬定第一期、（卽二十九年至三十年）每縣應設一圖書館、一體育　、第二期（卽三十一年至三十二年）每區應設一圖書館、一體育　、第三期（卽三十三年）每鄉鎭應設一圖書館、一體育　、敎育廳並組織民衆敎育巡廻施敎團、利用戲劇、歌詠·電影等敎育工具、巡廻施敎、使敎靑能够深入民間、此外並籌辦作戰圖畫、及戰時文化展覽會、以提高國民作戰情緒、灌輸現代知識、特別是推進社會文化、</p>
<p>以上僅就主要的而言、總之、作戰以後、福建省敎育可以表現幾種進步的趨勢、</p>
<p>（一）敎育設施、從消費的進爲生產的、我國過去的敎育、多少是消耗的、學非所用的社會上的需要、是一件事、敎育的設施又是一件事、致人不能盡其才、敎育亦成爲浪費、全國如此、本省亦不能例外、如醫學院、農學院之設置、研究所之注重工業與科學研究、職業學校則按各縣的特產、或原有工業、分別設立各種初級職業學校、或職業補習學校、中學及中心學校國民學校亦側重生產勞動訓練、這樣可使人有專業、業有專才、</p>
<p>（二）學校的分佈、從畸形的進爲種關係、學校設置多偏于沿海各地、不能均衡發展、作戰後隨着內地交通的發展、學校也加以合理的分配專科以上學校、旣不若以前一樣、多集中于一地、中等學校如建立師範區、中學區、和職業學校區、使每區校數均勻、國民敎育亦以保爲單位、每保設一國民學校「每鄕鎮設一中心學校、以見本省敎育、巳有從點」的擴展、而到面的趨勢、</p>
<p>（三）敎育的對象、巳從兒童的進爲成人的、過去的本省敎育、多少偏重于兒童方面、對於成人則鮮注意到、戰後卽發動高中以上學校學生、參加民訓民敎工作、藉以激發民衆民族意識、與作戰情緒、本年國民敎育制度確立後、兒童與成人敎育相提並重、成爲一種「全民一的敎育、最近國敎委員會第三次會議裹、更通過了加緊推進成人敎育案、專擬就永安縣方面、先行實施、此外如發動知識分子辦理民敎、師範生兼辦社敎·更爲本省近來側重成人敎育的表現、</p>
<p>本省敎育已漸漸的納入正軌、希望敎育界同仁、更要繼櫝的努力、以完成建國的大業、（完）</p>

<p>紫銅黄銅大多來自美國與日本、雖未受歐戰影響、然途中運費及保險費、却非常昂貴、兼之最近來太平洋風雲日緊、來源亦减、故滬埠人心相當良好、行盤異常堅昂、惟實銷方面、受昂價影響、泰半不敢動辦、加以外埠客幫最近又無動靜、納胃亦見銳减、刻所能應市者僅本街用戶及零星買賣而已、故市况未有如何熱鬧、而各貨喊價仍昂、如老TC紫銅錠沽五百六十元、紫銅板售五百六十元、紫銅片（南昶廠）五百三十元、十三號紫銅片五百五十元、十六號紫銅絲三百元、紫銅管每磅六元、粗細黃銅條一百五十元、黃銅板四百三十五元、黃銅片（南昶廠）四百三十元、十三號黃銅片四百三十元、十六號黃銅絲二百九十元、黃銅管每磅五元、</p>

<h3 id="c58">工部局函復米評會　國米應酌定限價　並允恊助調查洋米成本　合法利潤由米評會核定　限制國米售價間接可撳壓洋米漲風 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>上海市米糧評價委員會、於上月米價高漲時、曾致函工部局、要求規定評定米價之標準、俾使評價會得憑藉此標準而評定價格、茲悉工部局於昨日巳將是項問題予以答復、其原函云、「據本局供應委員會之意見、洋米之售價、不應超過續行採購實際所需成小、再加相當利潤、若干利潤、始可稱爲相當、應由上海米糧評價委員會核定、若須與米業公會商洽、可先與該公會相商、供應委員會又認爲洋米價格旣經評定、則頭號華米（卽粳米）之相當價格、亦應由上海米糧評價委員會酌定、本局又通知該評價委員會、倘於調查續行採辦實際所需成本遇有困難、本局之物價調查股、當樂於相助、」</p>
<p>國米售價　須予限制</p>
<p>昨日國米與洋米之價格、每石相差數達二十元左右、最高國米之價格爲九十二元、一號西貢米之價格爲七十二元餘、最近每日國米來源、亦佔全市到貨十分之二、惟銷數對象、均係中上階級、若國米價格過昂、勢必影響洋米價格之向上、故如能適當限制國米之售價、亦可謂抑制洋米價格漲勢之一種辦法也、</p>
<p>米價不應　如此高漲</p>
<p>該局又宜稱、關於上月份米價騰漲癥結、據云十月初、因越南事件之緊張、法日協定簽訂後之演變、滬防航綫之深恐中斷、食米運滬之受控制、及外滙率之重跌、俱爲當時食米恐慌之主因、米爲華人之最要食品、其躉售及零售之市塲、旣大受上述各種情形之影響、華籍工人及支薪階級之生計、遂日益艱難、滬市存米豐富、且仍源源人批輸入、就事實論斷、當時之米價、實不應如此之高漲、又據該局某負責人聲稱、據該局調查、目前存米愈加充實、米價之高漲、厥爲投機米商操縱壟斷所致、而昨日米價反趨漲勢、尤爲詫異、</p>
<p>來源暢湧　價格續跌</p>
<p>昨日米市、因國米洋米俱湧、投機份子巳失去憑藉之口實、計昨日國米到滬者有二千石、洋米抵埠者除昨日抵滬之法國航務公司之開定輪裝有二萬七千八百零七包另眞珠米七百六十包外、挪商德達輪、前亦運到五萬七千餘包、</p>
<p>麺粉漲價　影響匪細</p>
<p>自麺粉價格高漲後、本市機製切麵業公會、先於上月通知各切麵店將每市斤之切麵價値漲至三角六分麵包業亦隨之將各類麵包售價增漲二三分不等、頃悉本市各大餅油條攤、現亦擬增價、平民生活、此後將愈趨困難、</p>

<p>上海泰晤士報云、美國海軍運輸艦甲蒙號、昨日（十四日）午後從秦皇島駛抵上海、載來美海軍陸戰隊士兵約一百三十名、以瓜代調離上海之同數美陸戰隊士兵、而從華北撤退之美海軍人員眷屬、亦搭該艦同行、預料甲蒙號將泊滬五日、載調離上海之美陸戰隊　百三十名與駐滬美海軍人員家屬多人、下星期一日起椗、前往馬尼刺、而所載海軍人員眷屬、皆將在馬尼刺離艦、轉搭他船返美、此乃美國務院擬具之撤退計劃所規定者、</p>

<p>美政府撤僑專輪最後一艘華盛頓號、傳於明日抵滬、二十一日赴馬尼刺、然後駛舊金山目的地、美僑之申請乘該輪歸國者、的五百人、茲探述各情如次、</p>
<p>已有多人　申請退票</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美政府派來末艘撤僑專輪華盛頓號、定本月十七日抵滬、二十一日駛出、上海美僑擬搭該輪返國者不少、惟現有改變初衷、向美國總統輪船公司申請退票者、據總統輪船公司中人聲稱、展緩啟程之美僑、頓不乏人、其故不詳、大的若干美僑寗願其眷屬在此渡歲尾、至來年初返國所致、</p>
<p>乘客總數　約計五百</p>
<p>就今日情形觀之、本埠美僑將乘華盛頓號撤退者、僅的五百人、內頭等艙不足百人、經濟艙不滿二百四十人、三等艙不足一百六十人、各種艙位、尙餘甚多、尤以經濟艙爲最、惟該輪歸途中經馬尼刺時、旅客或將大增、</p>
<p>大部美僑　乘總統輪</p>
<p>總統輪船公司塔虎脫總統號（十一月二十一日離滬）克利扶倫總統號（十二月九日離滬）與柯立芝總統號（十二月三十一日離滬）三輪之船票、皆巳預售一空、待購退票者頗夥云、同時、聞在滬載美僑八十五人、星期一日駛出之瑪里波薩號輪十四日抵秦皇島、續載美僑二百十六人、惟該輪將在朝鮮仁川復載美僑若干、尙未可知、</p>
<p>求資助者　僅有七名</p>
<p>據美總領署今晨聲稱、美僑申請資助、以便撤離上海者僅七人、連具家屬共十五人、領署刻正調查申請者之經濟狀况、如查明確需政府援助、卽當助具乘總統輪船公司各定期輪成行、</p>

<p>暫定辦法至於工部局目前暫行　定之電話加價辦法、計有三項原則、（一）營業電話及住宅電話之取費增加爲百分之三十、而營業電話與住宅電話之基本通話决數减少、卽營業電話由一百五十决减爲一百次、住宅電話山一百次减爲六十五决、（二）超出基本通話决數以外、無論營業或住宅電話、每决由國幣三分增爲國幣七分、（三）嗣後欲裝電話機之新用戶、押櫃費　爲等於月費二年之數、新用戶與舊用戶遷栘話機及裝置分機、亦自百分之一百增爲百分之一百五十、</p>
<p>一致反對此决電話加價辦法、雖尙未切實確定、但本埠數萬中外電話裝　、以及一般居民、以電話爲公用事業之一、不論電話裝戶蒙其影響、且一般居民、亦常借用電話、現所擬定之加價辦法、寶屬過鉅、蓋照此項辦法、如果實行加價、則不但在橫的方面（如月費增百分之三十基本决數减少）加價、且縱的方面、（如基不次數以外通話費自三分增爲七分）亦增高達一倍以上之鉅、公用事業不應出此、况上海電話公司近來之發達、純由於租界內用戶之增多、間接扶助其營業、今反加重用戶負擔、殊屬不智、中外居民方面、僉認此項辦法、增加過鉅、亦一致表示反對、</p>

<p>融五講經社第四决講經、首由沈達齡君介紹謝頌三牧師講耶敎與儒敎之同點、繼由陸規亮君詳說明謝君之學行及熱心、謝君卽登壇講演、其演詞如下、</p>
<p>各宗敎家　承認儒敎</p>
<p>泰西各國、設有日較宗敎學一門、許多大學及宗敎學院、皆設此科、關於儒耶二敎五六十年前歐美來華之宣敎士、研究很詳、尙有英文遺著論文、在「敎務雜誌」發表保　、民國開始、曾廢祭天祭孔等儀節、耶穌敎　敎十因此對於儒敎不甚研究、而儒敎份子在非敎運動時期中、常有人申辨儒敎爲倫理·道德·哲學·政治·敎育一類的制度、而不應列入宗敎、但據泰西宗敎學家的見解、承認儒敎爲世界流行諸大宗敎之一、</p>
<p>孔子耶穌　各有所自</p>
<p>儒敎自孔子迄今、有二千五百年之歷史、耶敎自耶穌迄今、約近二千年之歷史、孔子祖述堯舜、刪訂唐虞夏　周的古書、保存中國古代的禮儀、耶穌幼熟讀希伯來經典、遵守猶太敎規、　說「我來不是要廢去雜法書和先知書、乃是要成全」、孔子將皇帝後裔的文化精華保存、傳給後人、耶穌在世時、盡量發揮希伯來民族的宗敎性、而實行古代摩西的法律精神、並先知聖賢的敎訓、他在敎訓衆人時、常發揮獨自見到的眞理、</p>
<p>耶穌發揮　犧牲精神</p>
<p>最後向他的十二門生宣吿、他是上帝的兒子、猶太人向重先知、聞耶穌由師傳的地位升爲彌賽亞（卽救世主）的尊位時、好多人懷疑反對他、在他　解猶太法庭時、大祭可問他說、「你是上帝的兒子基督不是」、他　說、「你說的是」、這句口供、竟判定他死的罪名、（見馬太福音二十六章六十三節至六十六節）被猶太人釘死十字架、此耶穌與孔子不同之處、</p>
<p>父母子女　在孝與愛</p>
<p>現在略將儒耶二敎的倫理觀念、作一比較、孔子曰、「己所不欲、勿施於人、」耶穌說、「所以無論何事、你們願意人怎樣待你們、你們也要怎樣待人、」儒教注重孝道、但基督敎用「愛」字包括一切、凡愛父母長輩的子女們、當然知道「孝」的意義、猶太敎將孝道包含在十誡之內、卽第五戒、「當孝敬父母、父母對於子女、亦以愛爲最大的感化力、不但敎之育之、更要使子女們的靈德日　、敎他　愛上帝、信奉上帝皈依基督的子女、大都也敬愛他們的父母、在信奉基督敎的家庭中、子女與父母比較更爲接近什麼話要向父母說、就很自然的說出來、父子之間、祇有愛能使兒女不懼怕、不作明瞞暗騙的事、</p>
<p>夫婦結合　愛爲基礎</p>
<p>同樣、夫婦的關係、亦以愛爲基礎、一夫二妻、缺基督敎建設高尙淸潔家庭的原則、看婚姻爲神聖的結台、所以新郎新婦、須在上帝和衆人面前宣誓立的、一定彼此相愛、合作到底、他倆有同一的理想目標、同心謀家庭的幸福、這樣的家庭、是建立在「彼此相愛」上面的、</p>
<p>交友精義　亦復相同</p>
<p>論到朋友的關係、耶穌與儒敎亦有相同之點、「忠恕」二字、是儒敎的大道、耶穌仍講「愛」的道理、孔子的交友、與希臘哲學家亞理斯多得的友誼觀念相同、卽根據互相友愛的原則、耶穌說、「人爲朋友捨命、人的愛心、沒有比這僩大的、」他又說、「愛你的鄰舍、如同自己、」這哩「鄰舍」二字、指不甚相識的鄰居、照耶穌看來、窮苦人亦是朋友、一位宣敎師願深入菲洲、向半開化的民族服務、與他們做朋友、甚至爲他們捨身、這種精神、是合乎耶穌的敎訓、</p>
<p>爲公服役　互尊互愛</p>
<p>關乎君臣的關係、儒敎因產生在封建時代、故君臣的倫理、當然適合、孟子說、「民爲貴、似乎適宜於近代的民主政體、耶穌敎提倡彼此相愛、故在上級與下級官員之間、採互尊的原則、一個小職員、假如很忠實的爲國效勞、服務民衆、仙的地位、亦是很尊貴的、因他人格是高尙的、照基督敎的解說、在上的官員、是衆人的僕役、」公僕名字、亦由信奉耶穌敎的國家所創用、耶穌的主義、在有君王的國家也行得通、苟在上執政者愛民、在下的百姓也自然的愛戴、耶穌敎根據「上帝是人們的天父、」人們因而以同胞手足相待、耶穌敎講人道與天道不能分離、人與人之間、如欲有正常的關係、則人與上帝之間、必同樣的有正常關係，末復介紹世界十一大宗敎五敎以外之各敎而講畢、</p>

<p>吾們生活着就應該享受人生的樂趣，無論我們做那一種　　，終應該愉快　樂，然後方　能　感到工作的興趣。中國有一句古語「人無　、　　　　」的　　有眞理在內的，因爲一個人常是　眉苦臉，怎會得成功呢？古時的希臘人也有一句話：叫做「健全的心靈，寓於健全的身體」。所以無論我們所做的是什麼行爲，我們必須有健全的身體。</p>
<p>不過，一個人終究不能發生沒有疾病的。不要云說那些危險而嚴　的病症，卽使是發生了一點疼痛！頭痛，牙痛，風濕痛或者神經痛，或者月經痛！　就覺得痛苦非常了。有了這種疼痛，我們感到失望，因爲我們不能作娛樂，不能參加賓會，卽使是看一塲電影，也成爲不可能的事。</p>
<p>可是這種疼痛是可以很迅速的終止的，所以不必任受。最迅速安全的止痛方法，是吞服散利痛一片或者二片，在十分鐘之內，疼痛完全消減，我們的身體，也就十分舒適了。散利痛是瑞士赫孚孟　氏有限公司所製造的，所以絕對安全可靠。</p>

<p>— 品品</p>
<p>本月五日西比利亞有個電訊，說該地東部有一萬頭的野鹿遷栘，原因是氣候驟冷不克生存。這是動物界的常見現象，不足爲奇；但一看當時遷移的景象，又十分奇了。電訊的記絨如下：</p>
<p>「鹿羣之後有大批豺狼追隨，攻擊荏弱及患病之鹿；狼羣之後，則跟有無數野鼠，吞食豺狼所棄之殘餘。」</p>
<p>細察這段記載，覺得希奇之外，更領悟得一個有關人類大問題的啟示。</p>
<p>野鹿——更切實些，應該是馴鹿（Reindeer），是寒冷地帶的主要生物，十分馴良，有用，用哲學的話說，「善」。牠們爲了一種壓迫，遷地爲良，却被狼羣追逐，衰老的更受了無謂的犧牲，那些狼，眞是屬於「惡」的一面。狼在乘火打刼，助紂爲虐，是鹿的仇人。那些野鼠，獐頭鼠目，鬼鬼祟祟，躱在惡勢力的後邊，揀些殘餘的血肉以　饞脗，不僅可醜，並且可鄙，囤起米粒抬高物價，抽吸水火之中平民的血肉，就是卑賤的鼠羣。壓迫與追逐可以抵禦，難道無法對付跳梁？</p>
<p>起來，不願受人宰割的人，跟一切惡勢力死拼！</p>

<p>— 裴苓</p>
<p>兩三天一過，人們簡直好像不知道世界上曾經有過這樣一個人存在着似的。當主人吃剩了飯，向下人們說：「倒給老乞丐吃好了！」的時候，下人們才恭敬地回答一聲：「老爺！他已經死了！」</p>
<p>「唔！他巳經死了了！」</p>
<p>和結束其他的小事一樣，這件事便這樣地結束了。</p>
<p>他究竟是怎樣的一個人呢？他祗是個貧無立錐之地的乞丐，人們都叫他老乞丐。但他並不是一個平凡的乞丐，依他的思想和行動，簡直可當「老愛國者」而無愧；然而他畢竟被人遺忘了。在全弄之中，我和他的關係算比較最密切的。到現在，他依然在我的腦海中留下了一個不可磨滅的印象！</p>
<p>弄口有一塊小空地，是造屋時留下來的。以前，看弄堂的便在那兒造了一所小木屋，住在裏面。一年前，看弄堂的死了，這所木屋就一直空着。一天早晨，弄堂口發現了一個老乞丐，睡在地上抖着，於是大家「呈准」了大房東，讓他住在那所屋裹，兼做看弄堂之職，沒有薪水。各家有吃剩了的飯菜，就全倒給他吃，這樣也有三個多月了。</p>
<p>他，據他自己說，已經有七十四歲了，看那樣子，也該有這樣大的年紀了。臉上的皺紋，花白的鬍鬚，七八顆的牙齒，都可以證明他已經在這世界上生存了七十幾年。全弄堂裹的孩子們都很歡喜他，大概是因爲他會講故事的關係。弟妹們聽了他的故事回來，都向我說很好聽，甚至比學校裏老師們講的還要好聽。受了他們的慫恿，在第　天的晚上，我也悄悄地去聽了。他正在講，講的是「閻應元死守江陰」。他的小房間裏擠　了十三四個孩子，我是站在門外的。沒有一個孩子講話，只有他的蒼老的聽音在西風中顫動着，悲壯而激烈。</p>
<p>『再講一個！再講一個！」當他停住的時候，孩子們全哄起來。</p>
<p>「不講了！對不起，小少爺！一天講一隻好不好？」他用哀求的口吻向孩子們說。</p>
<p>孩子們沒反對，一個個　他的木屋中走了出來。在弄裏，他們都興奮地互相說着：</p>
<p>『眞好聽！』</p>
<p>『明天早點夾！』</p>
<p>『明天我帶餅乾來送給他吃！』</p>
<p>我走進他的房裹，他正在從破茶壺裹倒了一杯冷茶在喝，看見我進來，用驚異的眼光望着我。</p>
<p>『眞難爲你，講這些故事給孩子們聽！』</p>
<p>『那裹話！少爺，唉，我老了！不能講一點更好聽的故事給小少爺們聽了！』</p>
<p>『你有兒子麼？』</p>
<p>他向我看看，一滴眼淚落在桌上。</p>
<p>『唉！可憐，大兒子打死了，小兒子炸死了！剩下我這苦命的老頭子。』</p>
<p>這幾名話可代表他全部的血淚史。我也不忍再問下去了，同情心逼着我，手從袋裏摸了一張一元票，塞在他顫抖着的手裹。</p>
<p>「這錢你留着用用。」</p>
<p>他沒有說話，過了半天，才迸出一句：</p>
<p>「少爺，你眞好！」</p>
<p>國慶日的晚上，我很遲才回家，走進弄裹，在黑暗中有人抓住我的手，接着一個熟悉的聲音響起來：</p>
<p>『少爺！是我！』</p>
<p>『麼？』我用雷筒照着他</p>
<p>他很快地從袋裹掏出一張一元票——就是我給他的那一張——另外又拿出了一張兩角的，五張一角的，和六張五分的，一併塞在我手心裏。</p>
<p>『難爲你替我捐給國家吧</p>
<p>我呆住了，</p>
<p>「謝謝你！少爺！這一共的兩塊錢，是我平日省下來的。我老了，用不着它了，你替我捐給國家吧！」</p>
<p>他說完，便回到那所小屋</p>
<p>刮大風的早晨，我起身的時候，娘姨告訴我老乞丐死了，是凍死的！</p>
<p>不等穿好衣服，我三步併做兩步跑到那所小木屋裏，已經看不見他了。旁人吿訴我說，他已被送到某某山莊去了。兩股眼淚流過我的面孔滴了下來，一個熟悉的聽音又在我的耳邊嚮着：</p>
<p>「剩下了我這苦命的老頭子！」</p>
<p>如今，他是早已被人們遺忘了。有時娘姨們偶然聚在一起閒談的時候，才想起長久沒倒冷飯給他吃，</p>
<p>但他畢竟是一個値得歌頌的人呀，雖然被遺忘了。</p>

<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十一章　趙伯雄的供詞</p>
<p>趙伯雄繼續說道：我在短牆外面又躭攔了好一回時候，王麗蘭好像竭力奉承那雨衣客，態度十很狎褻。不過我口說過，最重要的一幕我不曾瞧見。我料想那張失效的電嗎，也許伊就在這個時候繳卷的。但我還彷彿瞧見那人臨走時拿出些東西來給伊，接着我見他退出來了。</p>
<p>「我本來的目的，要想處置這無恥的女子，但到了那個時候，又臨時變機。我打算先瞧瞧這個雨衣客的眞面目，如果可能，我還想查明他的踪跡。因此，當他退出來時，我仍避在西面隔壁的空地上，我才瞧見那人的年紀還不大，上嘴脣上留着些短鬚，一出門便向東在大同路轉角上去。」</p>
<p>霍桑忽拿着那把裁紙刀舉一舉，說道：「目慢，我們當時有一個疑點不容易解釋。伊旣然那麽趨奉那個雨衣客，論情也許要送出來，事實上却不曾。我知道你在等那雨衣客出門以後，又向那會客室中瞧過一瞧。我想你總可以給我們解釋這個伊所以不送客的疑團罷？」</p>
<p>那個少年老人點點頭，說：「是的，當時我也料想伊要送出來，但結果祇見他一個人出　；因此，我有些詫異，才重新瞧一瞧。原來那時候室中另外有一個客，事實上伊不能送伊的僱主出來了。」</p>
<p>我又不禁詫異地說：「另外有一恫客？怎樣進去的？可是從後門裹——」</p>
<p>霍桑忽抬頭瞧着我，說：「包朗，不是。這個客本來在屋子裏，用不着前門或後門裏進去。</p>
<p>趙伯雄速連點頭說：「對，對。我一瞥之間，瞧見麗蘭的蛄夫李芝範，啣着紙烟，已走進會客室。麗蘭正在開窗拉開帘子。我才明白伊所以不送出來的原因，我爲着要想追踪那穿雨衣的人，急忙回到汽車上去，趕緊開車轉灣。進入大同路時，那人的汽率已經開遠，追了兩條馬路，又停頓了一下，結果便終失望。我祇得重新同靑蒲路去。將車停在原處。那時雨點已小得多。我冉到短牆外面去一瞧，客室中電燈依舊明亮，窗也開着，麗蘭坐在書桌後面，那老頭兒似乎已不在室中。我　爲這是一個不可輕縱的好機會！就瞄準伊的心口聞了一槍，接着我便悄悄回上汽車，駛回亞東去。」　（一六七）</p>

<h3 id="c89">對上海戲劇學校的期望 <a href="#c89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— 織素</p>
<p>從事於有意義的新戲的編排</p>
<p>上海戲劇學校的創立，爲未來的皮簧劇延續了優良的一脈，雖然該校的成立還不到一年，但在主持人以及敎師們的努力之下，成續已斐然可觀。現在該校規定每星期三六在黃金大戲院演日塲，那一羣小天使們的演出，曾給予許多人以擊節稱賞的。</p>
<p>筆者一度看過他們的「四郎探母」與「楊香武三盜九龍盃」，孩子們的熟練而又精采的演與唱，眞是値得讚美的。從大體上說，該校對於保持舊劇的固有精華這一點是業已做到，但這也就是一件憾事；因爲在這一個大時代中，對於戲劇的倡導決不是僅僅給予觀業以娛樂就完事，在娛樂之外必須兼予觀衆以敎育，戲劇是敎育的最好工具，尤其是上海戲劇學校，所培育的是未來的舞台新人，與尋常的優伶不同，當然要希望他們負起一點憑藉戲劇力量以敎育人羣的責任來，現在綜觀上海劇校所獻演的戲，幾於純粹是舊劇，同時於劇本的選擇似乎也沒有經渦嚴格的考慮，例如「楊香武三盜九龍盃」的俠義英雄主義，固然不妨倡導，但像「靑石山」一類誇張神怪的戲，未免跡近迷信，似乎就沒有介紹的必要了。</p>
<p>固然，舊劇的原有精華一方面要保存，但在另一方面，有意義的新戲也應該努力創造，這一重工作期望時下的一般職業伶人來實踐是不可能的（少數有前進思想的伶人除外），而上海戲校則在這一個大時代中誕生，所培育的又是一羣未來的舞台新人，正可以負起這一個偉大的責任來，爲戲劇界創造新的生命，開拓新的大道。</p>
<p>我以爲，上海戲校應該首先組織一個編劇委員會，延攬對於戲劇夙有研究的專家，從事於有時代意義的新戲的編排，在舊的形式下產生有新思想的富於活力的戲劇來，例如著名的話劇「葛嫩娘」「海國英雄」之類，都是極有價値而可以將它改編爲皮簧劇的。（此外像「寗武關」「抗金兵」等，亦可重編。）</p>
<p>撒底一點說：如果不從事於新戲的創造，唱來唱去老是「玉堂春」「二進宮」「四郎探母」那幾齣陳腐的舊戲，數十年以後還有誰來「欣賞」它呢？</p>
<p>所以很希望上海戲劇學校能够好好地利用現在優越的地位，負起這一個不平凡的使命來。</p>
<h3 id="c90">嚴月冷的動態 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 星星</p>
<p>嚴月冷，提起她來，大家不會覺得過份的陌生吧，她就是嚴月閒的妹妹，在「杜十娘」中飾杜十娘之友，亦妓女一角</p>
<p>她在影壇，還是一個新人，剛於今年三月間加入國聯，在完成了「杜十娘」之後，她的新作，是與陳燕燕等合演的「倩女還魂」，那就是「湖上的悲劇」改編而成的。說起月冷之上銀幕，「杜十娘」巳不是初决，遠在聯華影片公司攝王人美主演「漁光曲」的時候，她就參加，並且，她的幼妹月美，也担任一角，爲了拍外景，還與王人美等同赴寗波去過之後，又一度在國華以客串性質，與她的姊姊嚴月閒拍了一部「夜明珠」。</p>
<p>所以論起來，此部「倩女遊魂」，已是嚴月冷躍登銀幕的第四部作品了。本來，在「倩女還魂」中她祖任的角色是陳燕燕一角之姊，但後來導演覺得月冷年輕，飾燕燕之姊，似乎不十分適合，於是決定將角色變換，去掉陳燕燕之姊一角，而改爲陳燕燕之妹，這樣更改一下，當然是再適富也沒有，於是，「倩女還魂」得以積極的順利進行了。</p>
<h3 id="c91">「女人」中的新發現　古寒小姐活躍藝壇 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 鐵流</p>
<p>沉寂已久的古寒小姐，在中旅「女人」一劇中發現了。話劇塲的長期演出，要算是去年春天的紅星劇塲打開先路，可是曇花一現，不久停歇。紅星古寒小姐，先後上演欽差大臣，日出，人之初等劇，博得相當好評，有悉其身世者，在報間替他發表了一個「司長小姐」的雅號。本刊亦曾登過訪問她的文字和照片等。</p>
<p>紅星結束後，古寒的名字，依然不少在報間發現，說她要上銀幕了。當藝華攝製「王寶釧」的時候，代戰公主一角，她因注洋爭奪，結果由貂斑華担任，沒有成爲事實，雖然她很爲導演吳村所賞識。經此打擊，後來又傳她加入新華，在「西施」中演出，不知怎樣又因故未果。而合衆「文素臣」劉璇姑一角，在未決定楊文英以前，也曾考慮到她。一直下去，古寒的名字，漸漸地淡了。可是有人發現過她担任過某補習學校的話劇指導。</p>
<p>現在，中旅正在上演全部女人演出的「女人」，却發現久好學的田秀蘭一角，態度自然，沒有火氣。她足跡所經殊廣，人生經騐，當然豐富，而對曰又明快瀏亮；如今叉活躍於藝壇，爲中旅放一異彩，唐槐秋可算是很有眼力的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Anti-Aggression Policy Not Just Empty Words: US Decides to Actively Aid China; Knox Explains Six Key Points of Defense Plan; British Far East Commander-in-Chief Takes Office in Singapore <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Boston:  Navy Secretary Colonel Knox, speaking here yesterday, promised that the United States would increase its aid to China. Colonel Knox also briefly outlined six key points of the defense plan. He made an impromptu speech at a meeting here, declaring that the differences between democracy and totalitarianism are irreconcilable, and therefore the war must be fought to the end. Knox briefly mentioned the key points of the defense program, stating: "First, we should do everything possible to help Britain, without endangering our own security. Second, we should be concerned about China. I hope we can soon aid China to the same extent we are currently aiding Britain. Third, we will expand our military greatly, regardless of cost. Over-preparation, even if premature and excessive, is better than being too late and insufficient. Fourth, we will not appease anyone in the world. Fifth, we will work diligently without boasting. Sixth, we will strengthen our resolve and spirit, because only through self-sacrifice can we achieve self-preservation." Knox further stated, "The war between democracy and totalitarianism can only be reconciled in the manner of the American Civil War. If the evolution of the world is to continue, then this kind of war should continue to the very end." He said that the need for national unity is greater today than ever before. He said that the presidential election proved that the American people are not intimidated by external threats. The next five years will be a difficult test for the United States. Finally, Knox said, "We should prioritize national security above all else, and business interests should be secondary." (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Washington:  US government officials last night declined to comment on London's announcement that British reinforcements had arrived in the Far East to help contain Japan's southward advance. It is widely believed that the State Department is closely monitoring developments in the Far East, including rumors that Japan has made another move towards the south, possibly seizing Saigon. Officials here responded to Navy Secretary Colonel Knox's remarks in Boston last night, saying that the time for empty words is over, and America's future stance will be reflected in concrete actions. Recalling Colonel Knox's statement in Boston that the government's new policy is to "work diligently without boasting," unofficial sources here indicated that women and children in the Far East, if they decide to accept Washington's repeated advice to evacuate, will leave the Far East within a month. One unofficial observer remarked last night, "We are therefore free to act." It is believed here that after three evacuee ships return to the United States next month, the government will consider its obligation to warn Americans to evacuate the Far East fulfilled. It is still widely rumored here that Britain, the United States, and Australia have established, or are about to establish, a Pacific joint defense agreement. Last week, President Roosevelt told reporters that this news from London did not originate from the highest official levels. However, neither here nor in London has this rumor been denied. Regarding the meeting earlier this week between Navy Secretary Knox, Army Secretary Stimson, and Secretary of State Hull, no statement has yet been issued. It is understood that they discussed plans to strengthen US naval and military strength in the Far East, especially in the Philippines. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Rangoon:  The new British Far East Commander-in-Chief, Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, who arrived in Singapore yesterday to take office, recently passed through here as a guest of the Governor of Burma. Brooke-Popham has previously visited Malaya, Iraq, and India. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London:  According to the "Daily Telegraph" diplomatic correspondent, Sir Robert Brooke-Popham's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Far East is the result of discussions by the Army, Navy, and Air Force Committee on how best to coordinate the British and Dominion land and air forces to defend Singapore. Brooke-Popham does not control the Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, whose responsibilities extend beyond the defense of Malaya. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing:  The Central Daily News this morning published an editorial stating that it seems unlikely that the United States and Japan will wage a major war in the Pacific. A major war in the Pacific requires extensive preparations, including the concentration of transport ships, war materials, troops, aircraft, and warships, as well as land preparations. Japan would not dare to advance south unless it had signed a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. Moreover, the United States does not need to attack Japan; a blockade alone would be enough to cripple it. Chinese circles here say that the British government's establishment of the position of Far East Commander-in-Chief indicates that Britain is determined to contain Japan's southward expansion.

<p>Tokyo: Political figures here believe that the Japanese Emperor's audience with War Minister General Tojo yesterday morning is closely related to the cabinet meeting held by the Emperor on Wednesday. The resolutions of that meeting are currently being kept strictly secret, and diplomatic and political circles are speculating extensively on the matter. Japanese newspapers prominently published news of the meeting and the Emperor's audience with Tojo, but made no comment. (Reuter, 15th)</p>

<p>Longzhou: The Japanese troops on the Zhennanguan front, using Lang Son, Vietnam, as a supply line, have reinforced their counterattacks in recent days. However, the Chinese troops, making use of advantageous terrain, fiercely struck back and on the 13th recaptured all outlying strongholds of Zhennanguan. (15th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Military circles here officially announced today that Chinese troops triumphantly entered Qinzhou yesterday morning. As a result, all Japanese troops in southwestern Guangxi and Guangdong provinces have completely retreated. The Japanese troops in Qinzhou boarded transport ships near Longmen Port on the night of the 13th and sailed out to sea. According to Chinese sources, Chinese troops also attacked Luoshan, east of Xinyang, on the 7th of this month. Well-informed circles believe that the Japanese troops may soon withdraw from Yichang. The airfield there is now frequently bombarded by Chinese artillery, and the Japanese troops are no longer using it. Military circles here said that the recent attack by Japanese troops in Yichang on Chinese positions in the suburbs was likely a cover for their retreat, as the Japanese troops must hold the outer defenses of the port in order to defend Yichang, and the outposts have recently been abandoned one by one. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: At a press briefing here yesterday, a Chinese military spokesman said that as the Japanese troops retreated from Nanning, the rearguard troops fought bravely to protect the embarkation of the main force, and the Japanese troops withdrawing towards Vietnam launched another counterattack on Zhennanguan, but were again repelled. The spokesman said that Chinese troops could soon enter Qinzhou. In the past week, Chinese troops have advanced to within one kilometer of the suburbs of Yichang. As a result, Chinese artillery bombardment of the Japanese airfield has caused heavy damage to the Japanese aircraft parked there. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: At around 6:00 AM this morning, part of the Japanese troops in Sanshui advanced in three directions towards Huangtang and Fanhuao, south of Chinese territory. The main force focused on the south and reached Qichantou around 10:00 AM. After a fierce attack near Xianjueyuan Village in Xiacun, they retreated towards Shiyuettangbin. Part of the force that attacked Huangtang from the Xiaolukeng area is currently facing off against Chinese troops. Another force that attacked Fanhuao was also intercepted by Chinese troops. (14th dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanning: The new Nanning is rapidly developing. The deserted streets and alleys of ten days ago are now filled with smoke from cooking fires and are full of life. Shops on all main thoroughfares are busy cleaning up the dirt and decorating their facades in preparation for resuming business. Some, because their shops have been abandoned for too long and cannot be repaired in time, are selling the goods they had stored last year. However, as the city's population increases daily, goods are in short supply. According to reliable statistics, from the 6th to the 13th, 22,057 members of the local militia returned to the city, and more are still arriving in an endless stream, averaging about 5,000 new arrivals per day.

<p>Hong Kong: According to reliable sources from Guilin and Nanning, at least some detached units from the Japanese 3rd Division, which withdrew from Guangxi, are now moving to Guangdong Province to strengthen security. The munitions and supplies for these reinforcements have now arrived in Shenzhen, north of Hong Kong. While the motive for the reinforcements is to deal with international matters, another reason is to cut off the main smuggling route for Chinese forces at Shark River in Mirs Bay. Zengcheng, north of the East River, also needs additional reinforcements, as the city was attacked by regular Chinese forces last week. Mobile units attacked the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and Shilong and Yichashan (transliteration) at the confluence of the East River. These attacks occurred when the Japanese troops were transferred to Guangxi and Xinan, so reinforcements are still needed there. It is understood that more than 800 wounded soldiers from Guangxi have returned to Guangzhou and Huangpu. They had left before the announcement of the Japanese withdrawal from Nanning. Rumors that the Japanese troops will also withdraw from Guangzhou have caused the value of the Japanese military scrip to plummet. However, Chinese high command expects that the number of Japanese troops in Guangzhou will increase significantly this weekend. Residents of Taoshan (transliteration) and Heping near the West River Delta received warnings of a Japanese attack from Jiangmen. An official hinted in a statement that due to pressure from the Japanese troops, the two places may be abandoned. However, this statement was later refuted by General Li Hanshun, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, and the central authorities. They assured the residents of the two places that they would defend their hometowns at all costs. The residents of Taoshan and Heping have contributed significantly to the war effort, so Chinese troops who had been transferred to the front lines have been replaced by other Chinese forces, so that the original troops can be recalled to protect the two places. Regarding the Japanese withdrawal from Guangxi, Chinese announcements state that although this was not due to a "direct attack" by Chinese troops, it was a victory for the Chinese "strategic offensive," forcing the Japanese troops, who had occupied Guangxi for eleven months and six days, to withdraw in time. According to Chinese announcements, the number of Japanese casualties in Guangxi, including those who died of disease, totaled 74,000. Chinese officials continued, "The lack of reinforcements for the Japanese troops was also a factor in their withdrawal. Chinese mobile units and guerrillas attacked Japanese supply convoys on the Yong-Qin Highway day and night to intensify the economic blockade. As a result, the Japanese troops often suffered from food shortages, and the terrain was rugged and prone to disease, so the Japanese troops were under great pressure."

<h3 id="e10">Second Safety Campaign <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Last June, a safety campaign was held in the Shanghai International Settlement. During the campaign, the results were remarkable. Now, more than a year later, the second campaign is about to begin. Recalling the usual situation, traffic order is not well-maintained; moreover, the statistics on traffic accidents and deaths show that last year had the highest number in the past twenty years. The causes are various and not coincidental. It is certainly not reasonable to say that the safety campaign has led to an increase in traffic accidents. The responsibility for accidents is not entirely on the vehicles; for example, pedestrians often stand outside the sidewalks and in the middle of the road, and even when vehicles are driving close together, they still try to squeeze across the road. Some even risk crossing before the green light comes on. If an accident occurs while walking like this, who is to blame? If a driver causes an accident to avoid hitting a pedestrian who is violating traffic rules, then who is to be blamed? Therefore, to ensure the safety of pedestrians, drivers and pedestrians should abide by the rules, which will reduce accidents. However, speaking of rickshaw pullers and even chauffeurs, while many are careful, there are still quite a few who act recklessly, speeding ahead, disregarding the safety of pedestrians. Sometimes, cars are already close before the horn sounds, or several cars drive abreast, knocking people down without regard. As a result, passengers are in danger, pedestrians are in danger, and even drivers are not necessarily fortunate. In general, drivers who dare to charge recklessly must have something to rely on, either boldness, skill, the influence of the car owner, or disregard for the safety of human life. Therefore, when drivers are licensed, they should be tested on what they should abide by, what they should know, and what they should do, regardless of whether they are chauffeurs or rickshaw pullers. As for drivers who cause accidents, they should be severely punished so that they will be warned. It is often heard that buses and trams cause accidents; tram accidents are often caused by starting the vehicle before passengers have finished getting on or off, resulting in tragic deaths under the wheels. The responsibility for this lies with the tram operators and cannot be excused. As for buses, there used to be good regulations: they stopped at every stop, and the driver opened the door and stood by the vehicle to allow passengers to get on and off, then closed the door, rang the bell, and drove off, while also maintaining order. However, over time, this has become lax and is rarely seen anymore. It is a pity that discipline is difficult to cultivate but easy to destroy.</p>
<p>The population in the Settlement is growing daily, and transportation is becoming more advanced and complex. Due to the popularity of telephone delivery by shops and under special circumstances, bicycles have become tools for transporting long-distance goods. As a result, bicycles are very popular, flying back and forth like shuttles. This also increases the risk of accidents, as drivers often try to speed quickly, relying on the lightness of their vehicles, and often dart between other vehicles. Some are knocked down, and others are unable to brake and flip over with the vehicle. In addition, the congestion of various trucks on the roads, such as the mixed traffic on Beijing Road, and the loads that far exceed the width of the vehicle, staggering on the roads, will all cause unsafe conditions if there is no way to regulate them. As for parking locations, on roads with heavy pedestrian and vehicle traffic, parking on the side of the road should be prohibited. Even in quieter areas, parking should not obstruct traffic. However, this is not always the case. Parked cars do not cause accidents, but they narrow the road and indirectly increase the chance of accidents. It is the responsibility of the police to strictly enforce regulations.</p>
<p>The biggest purpose of the safety campaign is to ensure the safety of vehicles and pedestrians. Drivers who know the importance of human life will never be careless, because who doesn't have family members and friends? If their family members and friends were injured or killed by a vehicle, how would they feel? So, those who cause injury or death to others cannot be free from guilt and should think about preventing accidents in advance. Pedestrians should not save a few seconds, risking their lives by rushing across the road, forgetting the value of their bodies and the pain of injury or death. If the vehicle is caught by surprise and cannot yield, then the fault does not lie with the vehicle. Therefore, the target of the safety campaign is not limited to drivers but is the entire city's population. If all citizens pay attention to this campaign, then the campaign will have a great effect.</p>

Although the situation is slightly tense, the Vietnamese authorities remain actively vigilant and have taken various measures to deal with various contingencies. The border area is as peaceful as ever. The people of Cambodia and Laos recently held demonstrations expressing their loyalty and trust in France. As for the negotiations, the Thai government requested Vietnam in September of this year to cede the area on the right bank of the Mekong River in Laos to Thailand. In order to maintain the integrity of Vietnamese territory, the French government immediately refused and requested Thailand to exchange ratification documents for the non-aggression treaty signed in Bangkok on June 13 of this year. By the end of September, the Thai government had brought up the matter again, and the French government maintained its original position. Thai newspapers then engaged in a fierce anti-French campaign, and the Thai authorities sent troops to the southern border, causing repeated disputes at the border between Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand. However, these were all local in nature and have not been expanded. (Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Rome: Regarding the supply of Romanian petroleum to the Italian war machine in Greece, it is believed that an agreement in principle was reached yesterday during the meeting between Antonescu and Mussolini. The Romanian Prime Minister and Minister of War, General Antonescu, met with Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia for one hour and twenty-five minutes. General Antonescu, accompanied by the Romanian Foreign Minister Stercea, was warmly welcomed upon his arrival in Rome. After having lunch with the Italian King, they immediately began negotiations. In addition to the rumored petroleum agreement, other economic terms are also said to have been drafted, some of which are said to increase Romania's agricultural and mineral production, with emphasis on the production of copper and iron. It is believed here that the development of the Axis-led European petroleum group has gradually taken shape due to General Antonescu's visit to Rome and Foreign Minister Molotov's invitation to Berlin. It is widely believed that Italy's major petroleum purchases are from Romania, while Germany's major oil purchases are from the Soviet Union. It is heard that the exchange of business delegations between Italy and Romania was also discussed. The general impression here is that General Antonescu's visit to Rome is mainly for economic purposes and aims to improve the winter situation during the war. (Associated Press Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to a communique, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu met for one and a half hours.

Attempts by the public to hold demonstrations have been stopped by British forces. There are rumors that Sabri's death was an assassination, and the authorities are investigating. The Egyptian king's speech at the opening of parliament yesterday took a reserved attitude towards Britain in political terms, leading people to believe that the proposals drafted by Sabri had been approved by the Egyptian king. In view of this recent incident, it is generally believed that the situation in Egypt last night was extremely serious. (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Berlin: According to well-informed sources in Berlin, the talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and German Führer Hitler were in complete agreement regarding the current and future relations between the two countries. All issues were thoroughly discussed in a friendly spirit, and an agreement has been reached, but its contents are yet to be announced. (Haitong Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin: At 12 o'clock last night, Molotov's special train arrived at the Markinya station on the German-Soviet border. German escort officials, such as Intelligence Director Dornberg, got off the train to say goodbye, and the special train then entered Soviet territory. The German Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Graf von der Schulenburg, traveled to the Soviet Union with Molotov. (Haitong Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German newspapers commented on the conclusion of the German-Soviet talks, believing that Germany and the Soviet Union were in complete agreement on various important issues, proving that the policy of German-Soviet understanding was not only completely successful but would also continue to develop on the basis of close and permanent cooperation. The "People's Observer" stated that the Treaty of Non-Aggression of 1939 has provided a path for the national problems of Germany and the Soviet Union to be resolved. This treaty has also enabled the two countries to find vast economic spheres, and the amount of goods exchanged has been increasing, proving that both countries have the determination to continue this economic development. Molotov's visit has increased the friendly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union. After his meetings with Hitler and Ribbentrop, he has completely understood the common problems between the two countries. The "German General News" stated that German-Soviet proximity is based on the continental position of Greater Germany in 1940. The German-Soviet border is at peace. The common problems between the two countries include the stability of Eastern Europe, economic cooperation, and the overall political situation. Germany and Italy are fighting shoulder to shoulder against Britain, and the Soviet Union stands firmly beside them. After Germany and Italy signed the Tripartite Pact with Japan, Germany and the Soviet Union should exchange opinions. Hitler's and Stalin's policies of calm realization have achieved mutual understanding on various important issues. (Haitong Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Semi-official German sources said that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has departed for Moscow, carrying a rumored new plan for German-Soviet consultation, which may recognize the Soviet Union's vast sphere of influence, including British India. Official reports said that as a result of Molotov's trip, Germany and the Soviet Union will conclude a new agreement on all important issues that affect both countries. According to well-informed sources, Stalin may endorse this new German-Soviet agreement. They also suggested that the Soviet Union may force Turkey to join the Axis powers, and Hitler, in return, will not interfere with the Soviet Union's actions to obtain a warm-water port in the Persian Gulf. (International Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London: The Daily Herald today carried a message from Sweden stating that since Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin, the Soviet Union is now demanding jurisdiction over Istanbul from Turkey, otherwise there will be a declaration of war on Turkey. (International News Agency Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: A Berlin dispatch in a Swedish newspaper stated that the results of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin will not be announced for the time being. Molotov's current state of elation suggests that a general agreement may have been reached, and the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain has also been determined. Soviet circles in Berlin now believe that coordination between Britain and the Soviet Union is almost impossible, but they believe that the Soviet Union will not join the Tripartite Pact at this time. The Soviet Union is very willing to see more capitalist countries drawn into the vortex, but it wants to stay out of it itself. Soviet sources also believe that what Germany is trying to do is to make the Soviet Union a source of supply to offset the United States' supply of raw materials to Britain.

<p>The Berlin Talks Result in Increased Understanding Between the Soviet Union and Germany</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov stayed in Berlin for two days on November 12 and 13 and held talks with Hitler and the German Foreign Minister. The two sides exchanged views in an atmosphere of mutual trust. As a result, the two sides have reached a mutual understanding on the most important issues related to the Soviet Union and Germany. While in Berlin, Molotov also met with General Göring and Hess, Hitler's representative of the National Socialist Party. Molotov left Berlin on the morning of the 14th to return to the Soviet Union. (TASS Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Moscow: On the morning of the 14th, Molotov left Berlin to return to Moscow. In addition to accompanying staff, such as the Chairman of the Committee of the Metallurgical Industry, Tevosyan, German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg and Soviet Ambassador to Germany Shafazhiv were also on board. At 10:30 a.m., German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop accompanied Molotov by car to the train station. Soviet and German flags were crossed at the entrance to the station. Molotov and Ribbentrop inspected the guard of honor lined up at the station. The German farewell party included Dr. Lama, Police Chief Himmler, and German labor leader Dr. Lee. In addition, all the staff of the Soviet Embassy in Germany also arrived at the station to say goodbye. Molotov warmly said goodbye to them and thanked Ribbentrop. After Molotov shook hands and said goodbye to the German representatives, he left Berlin for Moscow at 11:00 a.m. (TASS Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Turkey Remains Calm and Draws Closer to Britain</p>
<p>Madrid: A Berlin dispatch in a Spanish newspaper stated that the talks between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and Hitler may have a significant impact on the Turkish government, but Turkey does not appear to be panicked and is becoming closer to Britain. The Turkish Embassy in Germany is now handling matters with skill and calmness. General opinion in Spain believes that the German-Soviet talks have two purposes: first, Germany hopes to induce the Soviet Union to exert sufficient pressure on Turkey, so that Germany can act more freely in the Balkan Peninsula; and second, Germany wants to make the Soviet Union join the "two-continent bloc." (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: According to reports in local newspapers, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin with a large number of attendants makes it clear that the topic of discussion will not be limited to economic matters. Although the content of the talks is still unknown, there is no doubt that the Soviet Union has little desire to participate in the war against the Axis countries and does not want to oppose any actions of the Axis countries. The newspaper pointed out that the presence of German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen in Berlin at the same time as Molotov is particularly noteworthy. Papen recently attended a meeting of the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy. (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Turkish newspapers have all published editorials reviewing Molotov's visit, believing that the illusion of a German-Soviet estrangement has been shattered. German-Soviet relations cannot be changed under any circumstances. (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the magazine "Berlin Rome Tokyo," published an article entitled "Leadership and Unity of Europe," stating that the Axis countries recognize the Alps as the natural boundary between Northern and Southern Europe and have decided that Germany will lead Northern Europe and Italy will lead Southern Europe. Spain will also participate in the implementation and defense of the plan for a new European order. The position of France in the new order will also be considered. France must prove its desire to participate in the new European order and its determination to defend this new order with facts. The development of Africa is also an important issue for Europe and will help Europe's independence. All small European countries want European countries to unite and accept strong leadership. Most of the important issues in Central Europe and the Danube region have already been resolved. The Balkan issue is also showing signs of resolution. Germany and Italy both understand their shared responsibility for the Balkan Peninsula and are cooperating to resolve various issues. Britain and France occupy vast colonies and have failed to develop them effectively. Germany and Italy will develop Africa based on the principles of National Socialism and Fascism, so that Europe will not depend on the supply of other continents. National institutions that can be preserved will not be destroyed. Excellent colonial achievements do not need to be respected, but the legitimate needs of all countries will be considered and adjusted. (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Tragic History of the European War (3) - Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy (1) - Daladier: Outwardly Strong but Inwardly Weak <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Now, let me introduce Daladier during the war to the readers. It was Monday afternoon, October 16th, at the French Embassy in Brussels. By this time, the European war had been going on for six months. Daladier held all the power in his hands, displaying a dictatorial style. He held three important positions and all cabinet members obeyed his orders. My visit to Brussels was to complete what I considered a very important mission. Looking back on the past now, I feel that that matter was even more important than I felt at the time. If Daladier had acted properly based on the results I had obtained, then in May 1940, the German army would not have been able to launch a fierce attack on Belgium and the Netherlands, causing disaster for France and Western Europe. I did not inform the French ambassador to Belgium about my activities in Europe, but he knew that he would be able to assist me if necessary.</p>
<p>I said, "Please connect me to Paris as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The Ambassador to Belgium said, "Alright, I will connect you. Who in Paris do you want to speak to?"</p>
<p>"Premier Daladier."</p>
<p>The ambassador was surprised and said, "Are you sure you haven't made a mistake? Can I really get him?"</p>
<p>Only then did I realize that, from the perspective of the Ambassador to Belgium at that time, Daladier was a mysterious figure who was not easily seen.</p>
<p>While we were waiting for the phone to connect, the ambassador warned me, "Please be careful when you speak. People often eavesdrop on phone lines. If you are not careful, the news will leak out and the consequences will be dire."</p>
<p>The phone rang, and I picked up the receiver.</p>
<p>"Hello, is that you, Giromand? Where are you now?"</p>
<p>"I am at the French Embassy in Brussels. I have a very important matter that needs to be discussed in person tomorrow. Please make time to see me."</p>
<p>"How about three o'clock?"</p>
<p>"I won't be able to leave on the express train until tomorrow morning. The time will definitely be late."</p>
<p>"Please wait a moment. Then how about five o'clock?"</p>
<p>"Very good. But can you guarantee to see me at five o'clock? Because, given the current situation, I must take the night train back to Brussels that evening."</p>
<p>"Okay, I will definitely try to arrange it."</p>
<p>On the train, I repeatedly thought about what I would say when I met Daladier. I wanted to get his final decision within five minutes. The energy I had spent fighting with the Belgian authorities for the past six days still felt abundant.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, everyone who had been in contact with Daladier said, "Daladier has too many ideas and cannot make a decision on any matter. And it is getting harder and harder to talk to him. Even in a five-minute meeting, you will inevitably become confused, and he will become even more suspicious."</p>
<p>A few minutes after five o'clock, I was escorted to Daladier's office. I didn't even have time to exchange pleasantries or look at him. But I noticed that his face was red and his eyes were dull.</p>
<p>I said, "You must already know that I have just arrived here from Brussels. I have been working there continuously for six days—many things have been very difficult—now I want to tell you the results. In my opinion, it is extremely important, something we would not have dared to imagine a week ago." I spoke hastily and urgently, briefly mentioning the main points. I then continued, "But we must get this matter done as soon as possible. This is the plan that Mr. Spaak (the Belgian Foreign Minister) and I have agreed upon. Please write a letter to the King of Belgium and give it to me to take with me."</p>
<p>Daladier looked at me with a face full of doubt and said to me, "Write a letter to the King of Belgium?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Yes, Mr. Spaak and I have even agreed on the wording of the letter. We have already obtained the King of Belgium's permission; everything is ready. Tonight, I will return to Brussels and present this letter to the King tomorrow. His reply will be brought back by me. After that, their words will have guarantees."</p>
<p>Daladier's expression was truly incredible and almost callous. At first, he said some disappointing things, wanting to let me know that the results I mentioned above were not as important as I imagined—Daladier thought that this kind of result already existed—and it was very obvious.</p>
<p>I felt like I had been struck by lightning. No one but myself could understand the real situation at that time, and no one could appreciate the general attitude of the Belgian government before and after my six days of running around in Belgium. I knew too much about the various difficulties I had personally experienced, and I could still recall the scene when I spoke with Spaak. When Spaak spoke about Belgium's request for mechanical assistance from Britain and France in times of crisis, the fearful look on his face still lingered in my mind. Daladier's inhumanity was truly baffling to me. He did not say a word about my obtaining so much information and overcoming various difficulties in these six days, nor did he even ask a question. He had already indicated that he did not have time to listen to me. And what was even more embarrassing was that when I wanted to briefly explain the general situation in a few words, he always interrupted me and explained it first. I thought to myself, this was clearly his way of giving me proof, indicating that his news was more well-informed than mine and that he knew more than I did. I couldn't help but think of Meggison and Wilhelm II in my book "Men of Good Will."</p>
<p>But I will never be discouraged by these small details. I mustered up my courage again and said, "In any case, I must take the letter back to Brussels tonight."</p>
<p>Daladier replied, "It's too late tonight. Gamlin and I will be working together until midnight."</p>
<p>I said, "If you can agree, I will go to the next room and draft the letter. We have already agreed on the content. It will only take you five minutes to copy it by hand and sign it."</p>
<p>He shook his head and said, "No: First, because I cannot write directly to the King of Belgium."</p>
<p>"Why not?"</p>
<p>"Because I am not the head of state. Only President Lebrun can write this letter. Think about how troublesome this is."</p>
<p>"But Premier, I beg you! You must know that this is during wartime. Maybe next week Belgium and the Netherlands will be attacked. This is an important and urgent matter. If you still want to talk about red tape at this time, what other good strategies are there? And the King of Belgium has already approved this move! Who else but me would care about this?"</p>
<p>"Okay! Let me think about it for a while."</p>
<p>When he sent me to the door of his office, he was slow and hesitant, obviously showing some disgust. I thought it would be good to flatter him with a sentence, so I said, "The King of Belgium is still a young man and he praises you very highly."</p>
<p>"I know, I know," Daladier had already known about these things in his heart!</p>

<p>London - Last night and this morning, large groups of German aircraft furiously bombed industrial centers in the Midlands, Liverpool, and South Wales, with unprecedented intensity. During the day, German aircraft fiercely attacked London, failing repeatedly. A total of nineteen German aircraft were shot down. In the evening, Germany continued to send large groups of fighters, escorts, and bombers to fiercely attack the industrial centers in central England. During the air raids on London last night, although the anti-aircraft fire protecting the city center was effective, many explosions occurred in the suburbs. Two hospitals were destroyed. The most heavily bombed areas were Sheffield, Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Wolverhampton, Huddersfield, and Worcester. Also, according to reports, a large hotel in a town in the northwest, with extremely weak air defenses, was attacked at dusk, and many houses and factories were destroyed. Furthermore, it is reported that a large hotel in the Midlands was destroyed. Excavating the ruins revealed that many people were crushed to death. (International Telegram, 15th)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Aviation announced that German aircraft attacked England yesterday, but were shot down on the southeast coast of England before they could drop their bombs. Nineteen aircraft were destroyed, including thirteen dive bombers and one fighter. Yesterday morning, an enemy heavy bomber crossed the coast and was quickly shot down. It has now been confirmed that two enemy bombers were destroyed on Wednesday night. The British also lost one fighter, but both pilots were unharmed. Most of the German aircraft lost yesterday were shot down by a squadron of British Spitfire fighters. The pilots of this squadron set a new personal record yesterday, shooting down three enemy aircraft each. The twelve Spitfires of the squadron shot down a total of thirteen Junkers enemy bombers. More than forty Junkers 87 dive bombers, in various formations, flew towards Dover at an altitude of 14,000 feet, while the defending Messerschmitt 109 fighters were in teams at an altitude of 18,000 feet, appearing and disappearing in the clouds. However, twenty British Spitfires flew even higher, swooped down to attack fiercely, and dispersed the enemy aircraft. A certain Air Force Lieutenant leading the British aircraft squadron shot at a Junkers enemy aircraft, causing it to flip over and fall. He then destroyed another Messerschmitt enemy aircraft and hit another Junkers enemy aircraft, which caught fire and fell. Another British pilot continuously attacked four Junkers aircraft and saw two of them smoking and falling. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Last night and early this morning, British bombers carried out the most intense air raids on the German capital since the beginning of the war, amidst the incessant firing of German anti-aircraft guns. An apartment building was directly hit and completely destroyed. Fires broke out in several areas. Two British aircraft exploded and fell over Berlin, causing large fires. However, German officials said that the fires did not cause any damage. Several hours before the raids, the German anti-aircraft fire was denser than ever before, and the shells formed a network of fire. The sound that was produced merged into one, making it impossible to hear individual gunshots. The entire sky was a network of fire formed by anti-aircraft shells, which continued incessantly for a long time. The subways, buses, and trams were also extremely crowded, and the theater audiences could not leave due to the air raids. Countless houses were destroyed. However, the German high command said that such losses were insignificant. Well-informed sources said that four people were killed and one was injured in the air raids. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>London - On Thursday night, the British Air Force heavily bombed Berlin and attacked airfields, harbors, and ships in German-occupied areas from Stavanger in Norway to Lorient in Brittany. Ten British aircraft did not return. According to an Air Ministry communique, the weather was good and the moonlight was bright when the British aircraft bombed Berlin. Several high-explosive bombs were dropped on the Silesian Station and freight yard, and on the parking lots of other stations. The Anhalter Station and Templehof Airfield in central Berlin were also bombed and large fires broke out. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London - This morning, residents of the Channel ports were awakened by the roar of British and German long-range guns. The shelling lasted for two hours and was started by the Germans, who fired several shells before dawn. There were no reports of casualties. Later, British guns opened fire on German gun positions, and the Germans returned fire. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Since German aircraft launched a blitzkrieg against England, last night was the first time they concentrated their efforts on attacking the Midlands. After a town in the Midlands was heavily bombed, fires broke out in many places, causing considerable damage. Detailed reports are still not available, but the Ministry of Aviation said that the casualties are likely to be high. Other towns in the Midlands that were attacked suffered damage to shops and houses. Although there must have been some people killed or injured, the number was not large. Enemy aircraft also invaded the London area from time to time, dropping bombs, destroying several houses, and killing or injuring some people. Bombs also fell on some areas broadcasting to England and North Wales, but there were few casualties. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>London - After the British Naval Air Arm's surprise attack on the Italian naval base of Taranto in southern Italy on Tuesday, which damaged three Italian battleships and achieved astonishing results, British Air Force bombers attacked Taranto again on Wednesday. Although the details are not yet known, well-informed sources in London have learned that this attack was also very successful. When the British aircraft attacked on Wednesday, flying over the Gulf of Taranto, the moonlight was bright and clear, and the warships in the harbor could be clearly seen. The anti-aircraft batteries on the ships and on the ground fired intensely, but the British aircraft's bombs still hit their targets. Several high-explosive and incendiary bombs hit the main docks in the eastern part of the inner harbor. At one point, seven large fires were burning simultaneously, accompanied by continuous and violent explosions. As one of the British aircraft was returning, fifteen minutes after leaving the port of Taranto, it looked back at the port and saw the white light caused by another explosion, illuminating Taranto as if it were daytime. Naval oil tanks and destroyers in the docks also caught fire. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London - A Naval Ministry communique stated that British naval fighters have been quite successful in recent operations in the Mediterranean, destroying at least three enemy aircraft. Several others were also damaged. The British aircraft suffered no losses. On November 8, an Italian aircraft engaged in a "surveillance" mission was hit, damaged, and crashed into the sea. Also, a team of seven enemy aircraft approached the British fleet and was driven back. One of them was shot down. On November 9, British aircraft destroyed another enemy aircraft. The next day, one enemy aircraft was destroyed and another was damaged. Enemy bombs fell near the British fleet, but the ships suffered no damage and the crew suffered no casualties. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Alexandria - According to the Reuters correspondent in the Mediterranean fleet, I have just returned here after sailing with the warships for seven days, covering more than 3,500 miles. During this period, the Mediterranean Fleet carried out cover operations, enabling the Naval Air Arm to inflict fatal blows on the Italian ships in Taranto. British light warships attacked Italian and Albanian traffic and escorted convoys transporting soldiers and weapons to Greece. This cover operation was not only extremely effective, but the cruising fighters of the Naval Air Arm also shot down six Italian fighters and two bombers. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>London - A Reuters military correspondent has learned from naval sources the first detailed account of the battle of Taranto and the implementation of the plan that had been prepared for several weeks. The British aircraft carriers HMS Eagle and HMS Illustrious sailed to the entrance of the Gulf of Taranto in the dark of night, and then the torpedo bombers were hoisted to the flight deck and everything was arranged for a brave and unprecedented attack. In order to catch the Italians off guard and to strike their targets simultaneously with as many aircraft as possible to achieve maximum effect, the British aircraft had to continuously rise from the deck to form formations of at least six aircraft in each team. When they returned after the attack, the aircraft had to regroup and find their base and land on the deck. All of this had to be done in the dark without letting the enemy know the location of the aircraft carriers. This could not be done without highly trained pilots with great skill. The nature of the damage suffered by the enemy ships showed that the lethal weapons used by the British aircraft were torpedoes, as the damaged areas of the enemy ships were below the waterline, where the armor was thinner. The British aircraft dived down from high altitude and released torpedoes at the lower layers of the Italian battleships from a height of fifty to one hundred feet above the water. All but two British aircraft flew back to the aircraft carriers. The pilots were greatly excited about the success of this first aerial torpedo attack. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>Berlin - Hitler today received eighty-five German male workers and forty female worker representatives from various places who had been awarded the Iron Cross. Information Director Dietrich and several important officials accompanied the reception. Hitler pointed out that capitalist Britain was in a position of antagonism with socialism and therefore declared war on Germany. This time, it is not only the soldiers who are contributing to the country, but also the large number of workers in German armament factories who are working hard for the country, which can be said to be the same as the soldiers who are fighting shoulder to shoulder. Because the workers in the armament factories can provide the soldiers with the best military equipment, reducing the soldiers' sacrifices, and they can complete the best weapons at the lowest cost, saving the country's expenses. Their contribution is truly indelible. The German people are the foundation of today's Germany. With sincere unity and united will, we will be able to persevere to the end and achieve victory. At that time, Germany will be the most advanced socialist country in the world. (Haitong News Agency, 15th)</p>

<p>National Education</p>
<p>The province's primary education was actively promoted last year and the year before according to the pre-war plans. Since the Central Government promulgated the outline of organizational at all levels of counties and its implementation methods last winter, the province has first transformed ordinary primary schools and wartime national schools into central primary schools or national schools and implemented national schools. In February of this year, a general order was issued to all counties to begin the transformation, and key points for the transformation were formulated and issued for implementation. The province originally planned to have all 120,000 school-age children, 496,000 out-of-school children, and 40,000 men and women adults enroll within five years and be forced to enroll by counties in phases. We are now looking at the number of schools established reported by various counties recently, the province has established a total of 1,087 central schools. The original plan was to establish 1,000 schools this year, exceeding the target by 87 schools. There are a total of 3,899 national schools. The reason for this difference is that the budget for this year was finalized a little later, which caused the schools not to be established when the spring semester started. However, some counties have made up for the establishment when the fall semester started, but have not reported it yet, so it has not been included in the calculation. As for the implementation plan for the 30th year, it has been decided to first complete one central school per township and town. If the number of national schools in the county has exceeded one school for every three baos, it will be temporarily set up. If it has not reached one school for every three baos, it should complete one school for every three baos, which requires the addition of 434 central schools and 127 national schools, so that the province reaches 1,430 central schools and 4,394 national schools. What is particularly noteworthy is that the facilities for national education in the future will pay more attention to the even distribution of schools in terms of location, population, and schools.</p>
<p>Social Education</p>
<p>Since this year, the province has incorporated remedial education for out-of-school adults and women into the unified implementation of national education. Recently, the Ministry of Education has paid great attention to national sports, library education, drama, music, and electrical education. In accordance with this intention, the province has issued a general order to all counties to establish sports fields and libraries everywhere. In the Fujian Provincial Education Five-Year Plan, the first phase (i.e., from the 29th to the 30th year) is also drafted, requiring each county to establish a library and a sports field. The second phase (i.e., from the 31st to the 32nd year) requires each district to establish a library and a sports field. The third phase (i.e., the 33rd year) requires each township and town to establish a library and a sports field. The Education Department also organized a mobile teaching group for mass education, using educational tools such as drama, singing, and film to carry out mobile teaching so that education can penetrate into the people. In addition, it also planned to organize war paintings and wartime cultural exhibitions to enhance the people's combat morale and instill modern knowledge, especially to promote social culture.</p>
<p>The above is only the main point. In short, after the war, Fujian's education can show several progressive trends.</p>
<p>(1) Educational facilities are changing from consumption to production. In the past, education in our country was somewhat consumption-oriented. The needs of society for learning not to be used and the facilities of education were two separate things, which resulted in people not being able to give full play to their talents and education becoming a waste. The whole country was like this, and this province was no exception. For example, the establishment of medical schools and agricultural schools, the emphasis on industrial and scientific research in research institutes, and vocational schools were established according to the special products of each county or the original industries, respectively, or vocational supplementary schools. Middle schools and central schools, national schools also focused on production and labor training. In this way, people can have a specialty, and the industry can have special talents.</p>
<p>(2) The distribution of schools is changing from malformation to relationship. The establishment of schools is mostly biased towards coastal areas and cannot be developed evenly. After the war, with the development of inland transportation, schools have also been rationally allocated, and schools above the junior college level are no longer concentrated in one place as before. Secondary schools such as the establishment of normal school districts, middle school districts, and vocational school districts make the number of schools in each district uniform. National education also takes the bao as a unit, with one national school established in each bao and one central school established in each township. This shows that the province's education has the trend of expanding from points to areas.</p>
<p>(3) The target of education has changed from children to adults. In the past, education in this province was somewhat biased towards children, and little attention was paid to adults. After the war, students above the senior high school level were mobilized to participate in civil training and civil education work, in order to stimulate the people's national consciousness and combat morale. After the establishment of the national education system this year, children's education and adult education are given equal importance, becoming a kind of education for all people. At the recent third meeting of the National Education Committee, a proposal to accelerate the promotion of adult education was also passed, and a special plan was drawn up to implement it first in Yong'an County. In addition, mobilizing intellectuals to run civil education and normal school students to concurrently run social education are further manifestations of the province's recent emphasis on adult education.</p>
<p>The province's education has gradually been brought into the right track. I hope that colleagues in the education sector will continue to work hard to complete the great cause of building the country. (End)</p>

<p>The children's relief work organized by the Municipal Children's Welfare Association has gained deep sympathy and sponsorship from people in society. Four newspaper boy education classes have been specially established, accommodating more than one hundred newspaper boys, and more than eighty homeless street children have been accommodated, with education and skills taught respectively, so that they will not be without means of earning a living when they grow up. The association's operating expenses have always come from donations from all walks of life, but recently, it has felt the rise in prices and the sharp increase in expenditures, making it difficult to continue. Therefore, it has jointly held a solicitation of calligraphy and paintings for charity sale with famous Shanghai calligraphers and painters such as Ya Chen, Li Qiujun, Ma Gongyu, Xie Haiyan, Xie Gongzhan, and Yan Wenliang, in order to raise funds for maintenance. It is now known that the works submitted for the solicitation have been generously donated by celebrities in the art world, benefiting charity for children, which is truly extraordinary.

<h3 id="e41">Over 30,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive Again: Rice Prices Surge Instead <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Guiyang ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong, carrying 3,236 bags of foreign rice, which were unloaded at the company's wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. It was previously reported that the French company's Harding (transliteration) ship directly shipped more than 2,700 tons of foreign rice from Saigon. It is now known that the ship arrived in port yesterday afternoon and docked at the Huashun Wharf in Hongkou, carrying 27,807 bags of foreign rice and only 760 bags of corn. Unloading began yesterday.</p>
<p>However, the price of foreign rice on the market yesterday fluctuated sharply and did not escape the scope of speculative manipulation. In the early market, the exchange rate was loose and flat, and transit rice poured in. Actual sales were consistently sluggish, and new hoarding was reluctant. The market still had the appearance of entering a smooth path. The selling prices of foreign rice all saw a small return of three to five corners. Unexpectedly, rumors resurfaced on the market in the afternoon, and large players inside and outside the industry became active again. The original packages of Yinghua Company's recycled rice were particularly noticed by buyers. The spot price of No. 2 Saigon was 79 yuan in the early market, and once rose to 82.5 yuan in the afternoon. The November price was 77.8 yuan to 78 yuan in the morning, and rose to 80 yuan in the afternoon. The December price was 75.5 yuan to 75.7 yuan in the morning, and rose to about 77 yuan in the afternoon. The market price rose by two or three yuan. The spot price once rose by one or two yuan in the afternoon. However, in the evening market, there were many profit-takers and large players returning, so the market fell by a small number of corners to one yuan. However, compared to the previous night, the spot price was still one yuan higher, and the original package price rose by one or two yuan. The total spot transaction volume for the day was seven or eight thousand bags, and the original package recycled goods were as high as seven or eight hundred tons.</p>
<p>The arrival of new japonica and tea-seed wild rice is still scarce, with only over a thousand dan arriving. The sales market is also keen to absorb them due to the surge in foreign rice, so the owners are unusually firm, and the prices continue to rise by one yuan. The opening price of new japonica original package was 92 yuan, and the final price was 87 yuan. The price per hu was 88.3 yuan to 86.5 yuan. The tea-seed original package was 89.5 yuan, and the price per hu was 86 yuan and 85.5 yuan. The wild rice was 92 yuan to 90 yuan, and the Dujian price per hu was 77 or 8 yuan.</p>
<p>The demand for glutinous rice is also strong, but the arrival is not large, so the market is also good. The opening price of Yili white was 83.4 yuan to 83 yuan, Changdan white was 81.5 yuan, Hong Kong white was 76 yuan to 74 yuan, and glutinous lu was 66 yuan to 62.4 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Flour Trading Remains Quiet <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Trading remained weak yesterday. The offer from the No. 2 flour mill was still 17 yuan, and the customer offer was 18.5 yuan, with no changes for the time being. On the local market, more than 8,000 bags were supplied by the Fu and Fu mills, which was enough for distribution. The asking price for recycled goods of the old brand was still 19 yuan, but because the price was high, buyers were not greedy. More than 30,000 bags of foreign flour have newly arrived, but have not yet been sold on the market, so the owners are unwilling to underestimate them, and the buying and selling is quite hesitant. It is said that the selling price of high-end foreign flour is hovering around the 19 yuan mark, with no fixed transaction.</p>
<p>Wheat: Trading remained hesitant yesterday. The source of supply from Kunshan and other places in the interior has not yet been smooth. The selling price of the goods stored in the concessions is 27 or 8 yuan. The sales of Chinese mills and exports are both sluggish. Regarding Japanese mills, it is said that the Sanxin mill has newly ordered a large batch of forward wheat, totaling more than 10,000 bags, and is not enthusiastic about taking small quantities. It is said that the price of goods sent to the mill is still only 21 yuan per original package.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3 id="e43">Cube Sugar Continues to Loosen <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market trend turned steady yesterday, and trading was more active. The association's quoted price for spot goods was 24 grade coarse white, foreign warehouse, TML mark, 73 yuan, old goods 72.8 yuan, Dutch raw sugar spot goods 56.4 yuan to 56.5 yuan, delivery on the 30th of this month 56.7 yuan to 56.5 yuan. Taikoo cube sugar all fell slightly, B mark, West warehouse 75.2 yuan, East warehouse 74.5 yuan, DY mark, West warehouse 69.5 yuan, HX mark 69.3 yuan, East warehouse 69 yuan, HM mark, West warehouse 66.3 yuan, H mark cube raw sugar 55 yuan, 400 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Dried Mussels from Siam Sold Open Yesterday <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Dried mussels from Siam have been arriving successively. A batch was sold open yesterday, with large dried mussels at 198 yuan, medium dried mussels at 186 yuan, and small dried mussels at 178 yuan. The sales were still good, and the trend was stable.</p>
<p>Few Shrimp Tails Traded</p>
<p>Since the cheap sale of shrimp tails from the East, the trading of Western shrimp tails has been very quiet. Only a few shrimp tails from Lak have been sold, with a small amount. The price of the top goods was 285 yuan, and the final price was 245 yuan.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3 id="e45">Golden Needles Vegetable Prices Reported to Rise <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>According to a letter from Xuzhou, due to the gradual scarcity of goods and the decline in quality, the prices of golden needles vegetables have risen by five or six yuan. For example, the cost of Suqian vegetables is already above the market price, but the sales in Shanghai are not very smooth, making it difficult to raise the price too high, forming a situation of inverted suspension.</p>
<p>Metals</p>
<h3 id="e46">Copper and Tin Market Prices Firm: But Actual Sales Quite Sluggish <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Purple copper and yellow copper mostly come from the United States and Japan. Although they are not affected by the European war, the transportation and insurance costs are very expensive. In addition, the situation in the Pacific has been tense recently, and the source of supply has also decreased. Therefore, the sentiment in Shanghai is quite good, and the market prices are unusually firm. However, due to the influence of high prices, most people dare not take action. In addition, there has been no movement from out-of-town merchants recently, and the absorption capacity has also decreased sharply. Currently, only local users and sporadic transactions can meet the market demand. Therefore, the market situation is not very lively, but the asking prices for each commodity are still high. For example, old TC purple copper ingots are sold for 560 yuan, purple copper plates are sold for 560 yuan, purple copper sheets (Nanchang factory) are sold for 530 yuan, No. 13 purple copper sheets are sold for 550 yuan, No. 16 purple copper wire is sold for 300 yuan, purple copper pipes are sold for 6 yuan per pound, coarse and fine yellow copper bars are sold for 150 yuan, yellow copper plates are sold for 435 yuan, yellow copper sheets (Nanchang factory) are sold for 430 yuan, No. 13 yellow copper sheets are sold for 430 yuan, No. 16 yellow copper wire is sold for 290 yuan, and yellow copper pipes are sold for 5 yuan per pound.</p>
<p>The largest sales outlet for tin is Shaoxing, because the production and sales of tin foil there are nationwide. However, due to the impact of the war, which hindered transportation, the tin foil market is sluggish, so the demand for small tin ingots is also not very high. However, the Shanghai market is unusually strong due to the lack of supply. The opening price is 1,500 yuan per dan. It is found that only forty or fifty dan were traded yesterday, mostly taken away by retail investors. In addition, the Dutch tin market has also been sluggish recently, and the number of merchants and banks on the local market is small. However, the overseas supply is weak, and the local inventory is limited, so the sentiment is good instead, and the opening price remains firm, with a selling price of 1,600 yuan per dan. Only a few dozen units were traded by shipyards and machinery factories. The merchants showed no movement. The sales of other types of tin, such as Jianghua tin and Hengdi tin, are not worth mentioning.</p>

<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American exchange had entered a plateau, as the Bank of England and HSBC initially absorbed purchases, while Chinese merchants and speculators stopped and sold. Chinese banks had a good appetite for buying, leading the US dollar to briefly settle at 5.96875 yuan, before tightening sharply to 9.875 yuan. British gold also softened to 3 pence 75, but in the morning, Japanese and American banks had ample supply for sale. In the afternoon, telegrams came from Hong Kong to sell, which offset the buying appetite of speculators and Chinese banks, resulting in no backlash in trading. As a result, both British and American exchange rates closed without any change compared to the previous day.</p>

The market softened immediately after opening, as Chinese merchants and speculators continued to sell. It was estimated that foreign banks had received the American exchange for this month at 5.96875 yuan, but Chinese banks were already interested in buying, and HSBC also came to buy, so the underlying trend returned to flat due to offsetting buying and selling. It was estimated that Chinese banks on the mainland received the American exchange from foreign banks for this month at 5.9375 yuan. HSBC's listed price was announced unchanged, and the silver balance tax was unchanged. At this time, speculators suddenly turned to buying, causing the price to soften again. It was estimated that American banks settled with the American exchange for this month at 5.9375 yuan to 9.0625 yuan, and when the softest was only 5.875 yuan, shillings also softened to 3 pence 75 for settlement. Later, relying on Japanese banks to sell, and at the same time exporters also had positions for sale, it was estimated that all American exchanges appeared at 5.9375 yuan. The market was quite quiet at noon. The closing price for spot American exchange was 5.9375 yuan, British gold was 3 pence 765625, the same as the morning opening for American, British tightened 0.015625.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Gold Market Calm <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold futures market, both official and unofficial, saw mediocre ups and downs, closely following the exchange market with slight fluctuations. Although trading was brisk, speculators reduced their activity, perhaps because large players were watching and waiting for the situation with overseas cabinets to stabilize before taking action. The highest price yesterday was around 10:45 in the morning, reaching 5,695 yuan. The market was weaker later, constantly hovering below 5,650 yuan. As a result, the closing price was 5,650 yuan, down 18 yuan compared to the previous day. The premium for forward positions offered by buyers to sellers was initially 15 yuan, later 12 yuan. The cash price was 5 yuan lower than the forward price. The gold price for jewelry stores ultimately did not change, and Customs gold etc. remained flat.</p>
<p>Gold Futures Decline Again</p>
<p>The morning began with the exchange rate still hardening, and interest in buying was weak. Silver shops initially matched 10 taels, opening at 5,645 yuan, more than 20 yuan lower than the previous evening's closing. After opening, silver shops sold heavily, pushing the price down further to 5,640 yuan. It was estimated that securities houses sold 20 taels to silver shops at this price. Later, it was reported that the exchange rate had turned flat, and buyers gradually concentrated, briefly pushing the price up to 5,690 yuan. However, the rising trend was not strong, and before long, securities houses sold 20 taels to gold dealers, falling to 5,670 yuan. However, due to the sudden tightening of the exchange market, gold dealers and money changers entered the market to buy, pulling the price up again to the edge of the 5,700 yuan mark. It was estimated that silver shops bought 20 taels from gold dealers for 5,695 yuan. However, it was difficult to maintain the price, and with retail investors selling high, the price fell to a low of 5,645 yuan. The sentiment at noon was slightly stable, and it was estimated that silver shops bought 20 taels from securities houses for 5,660 yuan. In the afternoon, the opening was also small, and silver shops matched 10 taels, for 5,645 yuan. Later, relying on retail purchases, the price rose slightly by 20 yuan. It was estimated that money changers bought 10 taels from silver shops for 5,660 yuan. However, the selling pressure from silver shops was heavy, pushing the price down to a low of 5,632 yuan. At this time, retail investors and securities houses bought slightly, and the price rose again. It was estimated that securities houses bought 20 taels from silver shops for 5,655 yuan. Before closing, securities houses resold 20 taels to money changers for 5,635 yuan. As a result, securities houses bought 10 taels from silver shops, advancing to close at 5,650 yuan, down 18 yuan compared to yesterday's closing. The daily range was 63 yuan. The price of cash gold from the local brand of silver shops was more than 10 yuan higher than the futures price, and the purchase price was 30 yuan lower.

<p>The securities unofficial market yesterday, the market went from soft to hovering. Traders on the floor shorted aggressively, rebounding slightly, and then collectively covering, with neither side having a clear grasp of the situation. Outsiders bought hundreds of thousands, so the market price wanted to fall but stopped. Tongkang had been cutting more for days, and Hongda and Defu all sold in large quantities, but the market price did not fall. Only the C-type transaction was particularly active, and almost no one consulted D-type, so its market price was particularly low. The difference between C and D was nearly two yuan. There must be a period of brewing to wait for the situation to clear up. Yesterday, the transaction for Shunchang bought hundreds of thousands, and the amount for 6th was also huge. As for Lianhe, Changfeng, Lianyi, Xiekang, Dafeng, and Xinchang, they either covered shorts or newly traded, also quite lively, but ultimately failed to raise the market price, because Tongkang initially dumped, followed by Tongkang, Dingkang, Hongda, and Defu selling. At closing, temporary transactions covered, and C-type was again outside of two yuan. The closing result was better by five cents one corner to two corners five cents. The total transaction volume was about 2.4 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

Some stocks, the rising trend was particularly fierce, such as British Union, such as Steel, such as Jardine Matheson, etc., all closed at the highest point. Rubber stocks also participated in the rising trend. The morning trading was quite brisk.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Speculative Thinking Changes: Yarn Market Continues Downstream <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market, which was weak last night, continued to trend downward yesterday. This is because the environment is unfavorable, because the previous rising trend was dramatic, but failed to discover new peaks and retraced. Therefore, general speculators, in view of the current situation, are temporarily deeply afraid that the upstream market will be difficult to see, and this market situation has changed and inclined downstream, so although Hong Kong has nearly a thousand bales in actual sales, it has failed to raise morale. The fundamental problem is still thinking about consumption.</p>
<p>The morning opening of spot yarn, because the sentiment was weak in the afternoon of the previous day, everyone mostly held a realistic selling doctrine, so the market situation was relatively soft. The opening price of 20 count double horse was 1,235 yuan, down 5 yuan compared to the previous day. At this time, the trend on the market was even more chaotic, with shouting prices varying. Shortly after, it rose to 1,242 yuan, and then it was heard that the exchange rate opened flat, and the selling wind was flourishing, falling to 1,228 yuan. Shorts were able to cover favorably, and it rose again to 1,245 yuan, but ultimately, with morale not boosted, it fell again to close at 1,236.5 yuan. It is found that the transaction statistics for half a day were sixty zero twenty-five bales, and the market fell 4.5 yuan. The amount bought by each gang is listed as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e54">Cotton Mills Need to Decline <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The situation for spot cotton remains mediocre, because the market trend belongs to the downstream, and the factory's need is even more declining. However, Shanghua, Xinyu, and other factories still add to their purchases from time to time, but the amount is weak. The price of three-remainder cotton is 133 yuan, and the price of lower cotton is 232 yuan to 226 yuan.</p>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market is firm, first due to the purchase of speculators, and then due to the good spot transactions, and the result of the same industry buying and rising. The closing price rose more than ten pounds in sound compared to the previous day. The forecast for India, including predictions, was not much different compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton transactions have always been unusually quiet in recent days. The thinking of the same industry is especially fixed, because the inventory on the market is not abundant.</p>

<p>Yesterday's cloth market initially declined slightly but quickly stabilized. With excessive speculative funds and fickle market sentiment, most traders and hoarders adopted a wait-and-see approach. However, many small retailers were inclined to sell. Small quantities of both coarse and fine cloth, as well as twill, dropped by 1 to 2.5 jiao per unit. Prices for bleached and dyed cloth varied, with a general decrease of about 2.5 jiao per unit. Velvet was selling briskly, with popular 13-pound brands rising by 2.5 to 5 jiao per unit. Slower-moving miscellaneous brands fell by 5 jiao to 1 yuan. Wholesale and retail transactions in local shops were robust, with over 500 pieces of various cloths being added. Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers supplied over a hundred pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and colored twill, while Fujian dealers supplied over a hundred pieces of melton, blue cloth, and other items.</p>
<p>The morning market for Eastern cloth remained weak, but due to absorption by local traders and good transactions with dyeing factories, prices rebounded. White cloth, a leading fine cloth, initially fell to 34.95 yuan in the morning but soon rose again, hovering around 35.34 yuan. The market outlook stabilized, with a closing price of 35.475 yuan. Those dealing in serge opened at 1.09 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Fake Zhigong Melton Popular <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's melton cloth market remained active. Merchants from Nanjing and Suzhou continued to devise ways to transport and mix it with Guangdong goods, and single-batch traders were numerous. With the autumn sales season nearing its end, the main items traded in Shanghai were dark black, thick, high-quality flannels and overcoat cloths. Recently, due to various rumors, investors with available funds have been secretly seeking out and absorbing "Paris" cloth and cotton-woven "Yuan Qing" fake Zhigong melton. Its sales in the market have been quite brisk recently. Large and small shoe workshops in the city are stocking up on it in large quantities. Single-width cloth is wholesaled at 2.30 to 2.40 yuan per yard; "Great Enterprise Lion" brand at 2.15 yuan; and ordinary lower-grade goods at 1.90 yuan. Genuine wool Zhigong melton now costs at least 22 to 23 yuan per yard to cut and sell. To cater to the preferences of retail customers and boost sales, shoe workshops are mostly purchasing cotton-woven fake Zhigong melton. Ordinary pairs of fake Zhigong melton shoes sell for 3 to 4 yuan, while shoes made from genuine Zhigong melton must sell for 7 to 8 yuan. Therefore, the fake kind naturally sells better.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Coal Dust Panic Alleviated - 4,500 Tons of Herling Dust Arrive <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Due to the changing situation in Vietnam, shipments of Hongji white coal dust have been scarce for a long time, leading to the depletion of local stocks and soaring black market prices. However, high prices attracted expedited deliveries, and a large shipment of new goods is on its way. Yesterday, 4,500 tons of Herling white coal dust from Taiwan, handled by a certain firm, arrived and was unloaded at warehouses in Pudong. Although the list price has not been released, it is expected to be around 80 to 90 yuan per ton. The coal dust panic can now be temporarily alleviated.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Shanghai Municipal Council Responds to Rice Evaluation Committee: Domestic Rice Should Have a Price Limit Set and Agrees to Assist in Investigating the Cost of Foreign Rice; Reasonable Profits to Be Determined by Rice Evaluation Committee; Indirect Restriction of Domestic Rice Prices Can Suppress Rising Prices of Foreign Rice <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>When the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee experienced high rice prices last month, it sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting the establishment of a standard for evaluating rice prices, so that the Evaluation Committee could use this standard to evaluate prices. It is now known that the Municipal Council responded to this issue yesterday, its original letter stating: "According to the opinion of the Bureau's Supply Committee, the selling price of foreign rice should not exceed the actual cost required for continued procurement, plus a reasonable profit. The amount of profit that can be called reasonable should be determined by the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee. If it is necessary to consult with the Rice Merchants' Association, you can first consult with the association. The Supply Committee also believes that once the price of foreign rice has been evaluated, the reasonable price of Number One Chinese Rice (i.e., Japonica rice) should also be determined by the Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee. The Bureau also notified the Evaluation Committee that if it encounters difficulties in investigating the actual cost required for continued procurement, the Bureau's Price Investigation Department will be happy to assist."</p>
<p>Domestic Rice Prices Must Be Limited</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price difference between domestic rice and foreign rice reached about 20 yuan per stone. The highest price of domestic rice was 92 yuan, and the price of Number One Saigon rice was over 72 yuan. Recently, the daily source of domestic rice has accounted for two-tenths of the total goods arriving in the city, but the sales targets are all middle and upper classes. If the price of domestic rice is too high, it will inevitably affect the upward price of foreign rice. Therefore, appropriately limiting the selling price of domestic rice can also be said to be a way to suppress the rising price of foreign rice.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Should Not Rise So High</p>
<p>The Bureau also stated that regarding the crux of the rising rice prices last month, it is said that the tension in the Vietnam incident in early October, the evolution after the signing of the Franco-Japanese agreement, the deep fear of the interruption of the Shanghai defense route, the control of rice transport to Shanghai, and the sharp drop in foreign exchange rates were all the main causes of the rice panic at that time. Rice is the most important food for the Chinese people, and its wholesale and retail markets have been greatly affected by the above-mentioned situations, making the livelihoods of Chinese workers and salaried classes increasingly difficult. Shanghai's rice reserves are abundant and are still being imported in batches. Judging from the facts, the rice prices at that time should not have risen so high. A responsible person from the Bureau also claimed that according to the Bureau's investigation, current rice reserves are becoming increasingly full, and the high rice prices are due to manipulation and monopoly by speculative rice merchants, and it is particularly surprising that rice prices turned upward again yesterday.</p>
<p>Sources Are Smooth and Plentiful, Prices Continue to Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday's rice market, due to the surge of both domestic and foreign rice, speculators have lost their excuse. It is estimated that 2,000 stones of domestic rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday. In addition to the 27,807 bags of foreign rice and 760 bags of True Pearl rice that arrived in Shanghai on the French Shipping Company's "Keding" vessel, the Norwegian merchant vessel "Detda" also transported more than 57,000 bags previously.</p>
<p>Rising Flour Prices Have a Significant Impact</p>
<p>Since the price of flour has risen sharply, the Shanghai Machine-Made Noodles Industry Association notified all noodle shops last month to increase the price of noodles to 3.6 jiao per catty. The bakery industry also followed suit, increasing the prices of various breads by 2-3 fen. It has recently been learned that major pancake and fried dough stick stalls in the city are also planning to increase prices, making life for ordinary people increasingly difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e59">US Transport Ship "Cape May" Arrives in Shanghai with Replacement Soldiers; Same Number of Soldiers to Be Transferred from Shanghai; Dependents of US Marines in North China Travel to the Philippines on the Ship <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the US Navy transport ship "Cape May" arrived in Shanghai yesterday (14th) afternoon from Qinhuangdao, carrying approximately 130 US Marine Corps soldiers to replace the same number of US Marine Corps soldiers being transferred from Shanghai. Dependents of US Navy personnel withdrawing from North China also traveled on the ship. It is expected that the "Cape May" will dock in Shanghai for five days, carrying 130 US Marine Corps soldiers and many dependents of US Navy personnel stationed in Shanghai, and will set sail next Monday to Manila. All of the Navy personnel's dependents will disembark in Manila and transfer to other ships to return to the United States. This is in accordance with the withdrawal plan formulated by the US Department of State.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Central Bank Branches Operate as Usual <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that there were rumors that branches of the Central Bank, Communications Bank, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank in the French Concession would be relocated to the US military defense zone. A reporter inquired with a senior official at the Central Bank, who denied the rumors circulating in Shanghai's banking community that the branches in the French Concession would be closed. According to the official, the Central Bank branch in the French Concession is only a branch, and its business activities are limited to normal banking transactions, just like other banks in Shanghai. However, if the branch can find suitable premises in the International Settlement, there is a strong possibility that it will move into the International Settlement. It is reported that the Central Bank branch in the French Concession is located in the Yiyuan Building at the intersection of Avenue Albert and Route Lafayette, and the branches of the China Bank, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank are all located on Avenue Joffre.</p>

<p>The 23rd of this month is National Air Defense Day, as designated by the National Government. All parts of the country will celebrate enthusiastically and promote air defense donations. Due to Shanghai's special circumstances, no commemorative ceremonies will be held. However, in view of the Air Force's repeated achievements and great contributions, and to commemorate the inaugural Air Defense Day, a donation campaign has been launched. All sectors are actively preparing to voluntarily donate air defense funds on that day, which will be collected and presented to the government to strengthen national air defense.</p>
<h3 id="e62">American Passengers on the Washington Ship Extend Their Stay, Plan to Spend the Year in Shanghai and Return Home Next Year. The Ship is Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow. <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The last of the U.S. government's evacuation ships, the Washington, is reportedly arriving in Shanghai tomorrow and will depart for Manila on the 21st, before heading to its destination in San Francisco. About five hundred American citizens have applied to return home on this ship. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Many Have Applied to Cancel Tickets</p>
<p>According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury*, the Washington, the last evacuation ship sent by the U.S. government, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 17th of this month and depart on the 21st. Many American citizens in Shanghai planned to take this ship back home, but some have now changed their minds and applied to the American President Lines to cancel their tickets. According to sources at the President Lines, a considerable number of American citizens have postponed their departure for reasons unknown. It is said that some American citizens prefer to have their families spend the end of the year here and return home in early next year.</p>
<p>Total Number of Passengers Estimated at About Five Hundred</p>
<p>Judging from the current situation, only about five hundred American citizens in Shanghai will be evacuated on the Washington. The first-class cabins are less than one hundred, the tourist class cabins are less than two hundred and forty, and the third-class cabins are less than one hundred and sixty. There are still many vacancies in all classes, especially in tourist class. However, the number of passengers may increase significantly when the ship passes through Manila on its way back.</p>
<p>Most American Citizens Take President Liners</p>
<p>Tickets for the President Lines' President Taft (departed Shanghai on November 21), President Cleveland (departed Shanghai on December 9), and President Coolidge (departed Shanghai on December 31) are already sold out. Many people are waiting to buy returned tickets. At the same time, it is reported that the Mariposa, which carried 85 American citizens from Shanghai, arrived in Qinhuangdao on the 14th after departing on Sunday the 1st, and continued to carry 216 American citizens. However, it is still unknown how many American citizens this ship will carry in Incheon, Korea.</p>
<p>Only Seven Seek Assistance</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Consulate General this morning, only seven American citizens have applied for assistance to evacuate from Shanghai, including their families, totaling fifteen people. The consulate is currently investigating the financial situation of the applicants. If it is determined that they genuinely need government assistance, they will be helped to travel on the various regular ships of the President Lines.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Special Prize-Linked Savings Bonds Not Sold in Shanghai <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Central Savings Association, in order to concentrate idle funds and strengthen government finances, has issued special prize-linked savings bonds with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, which have already been piloted in Chongqing. The issue date is in January of next year. These bonds will be issued every two months, with a total of 500,000 numbers. Each bond sells for 50 yuan, divided into five units, for a total revenue of 5 million yuan. One-quarter of the revenue will be used as prize money, with prizes ranging from first to tenth class. The first prize is 100,000 yuan. However, the bonds will not be issued in the occupied areas for the time being. In Shanghai, due to the special environment of the concessions, it is not planned to sell them. Prize winners are exempt from income tax. The Central Bank, Bank of Communications, Bank of China, Farmers Bank of China, and Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are all sales agencies in various locations.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Shanghai Municipal Council Drafts Telephone Price Increase Principles, Awaiting the French Municipal Council's Opinion Before Deciding; Excessive Increase Opposed by Chinese and Foreigners Alike <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council for a price increase months ago. The Council has considered the matter and repeatedly presented reports at its board meetings. The Council has now tentatively drafted a plan for the price increase, but it has not yet reached the final stage. The Council is currently sending the proposed price increase plan to the French Municipal Council for its consent. If the French Municipal Council raises any objections or makes any revisions, the plan will need to be reviewed and decided by the Council's board of directors again.</p>
<p>Provisional Measures As for the telephone price increase measures temporarily set by the Municipal Council, there are three principles: (1) The fees for business and residential telephones will increase by 30%, while the number of basic calls for business and residential telephones will be reduced. The number of basic calls for business telephones will be reduced from 150 to 100, and the number of basic calls for residential telephones will be reduced from 100 to 65. (2) Beyond the number of basic calls, the price per call for both business and residential telephones will increase from 3 cents to 7 cents. (3) For new users who want to install telephone sets in the future, the deposit will be equal to two years of monthly fees. The cost of moving telephone sets and installing extensions for new and old users will also increase from 100% to 150%.</p>
<p>Unanimous Opposition Although the telephone price increase plan has not yet been finalized, tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign telephone subscribers in Shanghai, as well as the general public, regard telephones as a public utility. The proposed price increase plan is excessive, as it affects both telephone subscribers and the general public who often use telephones. According to this plan, if the price increase is implemented, the price will increase not only horizontally (such as a 30% increase in monthly fees and a reduction in the number of basic calls), but also vertically (such as increasing the fee for calls beyond the basic number from 3 cents to 7 cents), which is more than doubled. Public utilities should not do this. Moreover, the development of the Shanghai Telephone Company in recent years is purely due to the increase in users within the concessions, which indirectly supports its business. It is unwise to increase the burden on users now. Chinese and foreign residents alike believe that this plan is an excessive increase and have unanimously expressed their opposition.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Foreign Ships Detained, Shanghai-Zhejiang Shipping Severed, Maersk Ships Sailed to Songmen Yesterday and Have Withdrawn, Passengers of the Moufu Ship Not Allowed to Land and Imprisoned <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Zhejiang-Fujian shipping lines were severely affected by the Japanese military's announcement in mid-July this year to blockade eight ports including Xinghua. Recently, they suddenly announced the blockade of five ports including Gu'aotou, Shipu, and Haimen, and the Shanghai-Zhejiang shipping industry is facing a complete standstill. Although several foreign ships have taken risks,</p>
<p>Sailing to Fuqing is another question whether they can reach their destination. Yesterday, two Maersk ships sailing to Songmen and Gu'aotou were also obstructed and withdrawn to Shanghai. Previously, six foreign ships of German, Italian, British, and American nationality, Dasheng, Dacheng, Xinxingtai, Feikang, Moufu, and Anli, detained outside the Oujiang estuary, are all prohibited from entering Zhoushan Port. It was previously reported that more than 230 passengers on the Moufu ship had landed, but this is not accurate. It is said that they are still completely</p>
<p>Imprisoned on the ship, and the prepared food rice is about to run out. Therefore, a telegram was sent from the Japanese naval warship to the Moufu ship department, requesting 50 bags of rice and 3,000 yuan in cash. According to this, there is no intention to release them for a while. The company is now trying to transport the requested money and rice to provide assistance. It is also reported that the Haifu ship sailed back to Shanghai from Gu'aotou last Saturday (9th) and was expected to arrive early, but it has not been seen returning to Shanghai as of last night. There are rumors that it has also been detained, but this has not been confirmed for a while. The Haifu Shipping Department also denied it.</p>

<p>After the Second Special District Court was seized, there was internal chaos. For several days, the French police station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives, riot police, and armored vehicles, fully armed, to station around the court. However, yesterday morning, it suddenly sent 50 armed "guard team" members, 20 of whom arrived first, delivered by trucks, and assigned to guard the "High Three" and "Special Two" "Courts." After negotiations with the police station, the guard team that was sent was immediately withdrawn.</p>
<p>District Court Records Sent to Nanshi</p>
<p>When the "August 13th" Shanghai War broke out in 1937, and Nanshi was subsequently reduced to rubble, the Nanshi District Court, in order to preserve various case files, entrusted the French Concession Special Court to keep most of the files, except for a small number of the most important ones that were kept separately. The number of case files reached more than 10,000. It has been three years since the court took over the custody of these files. According to the report of the Xinwenshe reporter, the seized Special Second Court has agreed to send the files to Nanshi, which is expected to be realized within a few days.</p>

<p>According to the Daguan News Agency reporter's inquiry at the Pushan Villa, the situation of adults and children who were collected by the villa due to freezing to death in the first half of this month is as follows: November (1st) 27 adult bodies, 40 children's bodies; (2nd) 22 adult bodies, 40 children's bodies; (3rd) 7 adult bodies, 30 children's bodies; (4th) 21 adult bodies, 29 children's bodies; (5th) 16 adult bodies, 39 children's bodies; (6th) 23 adult bodies, 40 children's bodies; (7th) 20 adult bodies, 39 children's bodies; (8th) 20 adult bodies, 49 children's bodies; (9th) 24 adult bodies, 34 children's bodies; (10th) 33 adult bodies, 52 children's bodies; (11th) 22 adult bodies, 47 children's bodies; (12th) 17 adult bodies, 54 children's bodies; (13th) 32 adult bodies, 48 children's bodies; (14th) 29 adult bodies, 55 children's bodies. In total, from the 1st to the 14th, there were 313 adult bodies and 648 children's bodies. The cost of making coffins for the villa is three to four yuan per coffin. Recently, due to the soaring price of wood, each coffin cannot be made for less than 20 yuan. This has greatly increased the expenditure of the villa. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate and promote good deeds.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Negotiations to Reduce Meat Commission Failed <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the price of meat has been rising frequently, with no hope of falling, which indirectly increases the burden on citizens and directly causes meat merchants to suffer major blows to their business. In order to reduce the heavy burden on citizens and protect the legitimate interests of the meat industry, yesterday afternoon, more than a dozen representatives of the fresh meat industry from the two concessions and four rural areas held direct negotiations with the representatives of the brokers of the Hongkou "Livestock Market". As a result, the negotiations broke down. The focus of the friction between the meat merchants and the "market" lies in the commission. Previously, the commission for each pig was one yuan, but now it is stipulated to extract three percent. Each "pig" will have to pay a commission of five or six yuan. The original commission was one percent, but now it has increased to three percent. At 4 pm yesterday, the meat merchants negotiated with the brokers to reduce the commission, but the brokers shirked and refused, saying that there was no room for negotiation, and said that the "market" would extract a commission of one dime and could only obey unconditionally. There was no result at all. Now the meat merchants are determined due to business relations, and it will cause a serious storm.</p>
<h3 id="e69">After a Japanese Officer Was Shot, the Japanese Side Conducted a Strict Search, Claiming to Have Discovered Clues in Hongkou <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>At 1:30 pm the day before yesterday, a Japanese army captain named Ishibashi was shot and wounded in Haining Road, Hongkou. A brief account has been recorded in this newspaper. According to the Xinwenshe reporter, Ishibashi was shot twice at the time, both piercing his left scapula. He is currently undergoing surgery by Japanese doctor Honda at the Douin Association Hospital. When Ishibashi was shot, a Chinese youth named Shi Miaofa (18 years old, living in Jiugengli, Haining Road) was hit in the right flank by a stray bullet, but the bullet only grazed him and there was no major problem. It is also learned that after the Japanese Marines and others mobilized to guard the area after the incident, the Japanese side found an unexploded bullet and three medicine bags at the scene. The Japanese side is now investigating based on these clues. Yesterday, the Japanese side also announced that after the incident, a traveler named Dong Changxian (26 years old) in the Chunyang Inn at No. 61, Lane 311, Dongyouheng Road, suddenly went out and never returned. There has been no news so far. The Japanese side said that the traveler was carrying more than 6,000 yuan in cash, so they thought it was suspicious, but this person could not be found. At the same time, the Japanese side also said that at about 4:10 pm on the same day, near Feilun Road, a man about 45 years old was spotted by the consular police team that was dispatched, but he escaped without a trace after being stopped and searched. Therefore, the Japanese side is now paying close attention to these two incidents and is conducting a major investigation.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Philippine Republic. Filipinos here celebrated it specially, with each person wearing the national emblem on their lapel. The Philippine team of the International Business Corps has 85 members. They are responsible for the security of the Shanghai concessions. Since its establishment in 1927, the team has repeatedly achieved good results. The team is commanded by Stevens. Yesterday, they held exercises at the racecourse. According to the friendly relations between China and the Philippines, which have always been extremely harmonious, the Chinese government recently sent Wu Tiecheng to visit the Philippines. There are now more than 200,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Chinese Consul in Philippines Wrote Congratulatory Article Yang Guangzheng, the Chinese Consul in the Philippines, wrote a special article to congratulate the Philippine National Day, saying that the Philippine people will once again celebrate the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the Republic. The Chinese people are eager to take this opportunity to wish the Philippines prosperity. In this turbulent world, the Philippines is in the midst of this vortex, but still remains outside of it. The overseas Chinese living in the country are also able to live and work in peace and contentment, which is very fortunate. On this auspicious occasion, we must express our gratitude to the Philippine government and people. Today, the Philippine people will plant another sign on their road to achieving full independence. We firmly believe that they will not only become a fully developed country, but also a bastion of peace, democracy, and friendly international relations in Asia.</p>
<p>Fully Independent After Five Years According to the Philippines, it was discovered by the Spaniard Magellan on March 15, 1521, and was subsequently ruled by Spain for more than 370 years. In 1898, a war broke out between Spain and the United States. A U.S. fleet sailed directly to the Philippines and defeated the Spanish Navy, cooperating with internal elements in the Philippines. In December of the same year, the Treaty of Paris was signed, and the Philippines came into the hands of the United States. After repeated discussions by the U.S. government, the Philippine Republican government was established on November 15, 1935, and a constitution was passed, stipulating full independence after ten years. The current president of the Philippines is Quezon, and the vice president is Osmeña.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Shaoxing remittance of the Jianye Bank was temporarily suspended last month due to the fierce fighting in the suburbs of Shaoxing. After the recovery, it could not be restored immediately due to various reasons. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the relevant parties, the Shanghai-Shaoxing remittance of the bank has been restored, but the amount is limited to 1,000 yuan. In addition, the Shanghai Post Office has restored remittances to eastern Zhejiang, such as Zhuji, Shaoxing, Keqiao, and Linpu. In particular, the remittance business in various counties such as Ningbo, Yuyao, Cixi, Fenghua, and Yongjia is even more developed. However, the remittance to Zhenhai has not been restored since it was suspended in July, four months ago.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Rongwu Society's Fourth Lecture on Scriptures, Discussing Similarities Between Christianity and Confucianism, Jesus Teaches People With "Love" Word With Broad Meaning <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The fourth lecture on scriptures of the Rongwu Lecture Society was first introduced by Mr. Shen Daling, who invited Pastor Xie Songsan to talk about the similarities between Christianity and Confucianism. Then, Mr. Lu Guiliang explained in detail Mr. Xie's learning and enthusiasm. Mr. Xie then took the stage to give a lecture. His speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Religious Scholars Acknowledge Confucianism</p>
<p>Western countries have a discipline called comparative religious studies. Many universities and religious colleges have this department. Regarding the two religions of Confucianism and Christianity, the missionaries who came to China from Europe and the United States fifty or sixty years ago studied them in great detail. There are still English legacy papers published in the "Educational Affairs Magazine". Since the beginning of the Republic of China, the ceremonies such as offering sacrifices to heaven and Confucius have been abolished. Therefore, Christian religions do not study Confucianism very much. And during the anti-religious movement period, Confucian members often defended Confucianism as an ethical, moral, philosophical, political, and educational system, and should not be included in religion. But according to the views of Western religious scholars, Confucianism is recognized as one of the major religions prevailing in the world.</p>
<p>Confucius and Jesus Each Have Their Own Sources</p>
<p>Confucianism has a history of 2,500 years from Confucius to the present, and Christianity has a history of nearly 2,000 years from Jesus to the present. Confucius followed Yao and Shun and revised the ancient books of Tang, Yu, Xia, Shang, and Zhou to preserve the ancient rituals of China. Jesus was well versed in Hebrew classics from a young age and obeyed Jewish regulations. He said, "I did not come to abolish the law and the prophets; I came to fulfill them." Confucius preserved the cultural essence of the descendants of the emperor and passed it on to future generations. When Jesus was in the world, he tried his best to develop the religious nature of the Hebrew nation and implement the spirit of the ancient Mosaic law, as well as the teachings of the prophets and sages. When he taught the people, he often expounded the truth he saw himself.</p>
<p>Jesus Expounded the Spirit of Sacrifice</p>
<p>Finally, he announced to his twelve disciples that he was the son of God. The Jews valued prophets. When Jesus rose from the position of teacher to the dignity of Messiah (that is, savior), many people doubted and opposed him. When he was tried in the Jewish court, the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of God?" He said, "You have said so." This confession sentenced him to death. (See Matthew 26:63-66) He was crucified by the Jews. This is the difference between Jesus and Confucius.</p>
<p>Parents and Children In Filial Piety and Love</p>
<p>Now I will briefly compare the ethical concepts of Confucianism and Christianity. Confucius said, "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Jesus said, "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you." Confucianism emphasizes filial piety, but Christianity uses the word "love" to include everything. Children who love their parents and elders naturally know the meaning of "filial piety". Judaism includes filial piety in the Ten Commandments, that is, the fifth commandment, "Honor your father and your mother." Parents also use love as the greatest influence on their children. Not only do they teach and raise them, but they must also make their children's spiritual virtues grow day by day. Teach them to love God, believe in God, and the children who convert to Christ mostly also love their parents. In Christian families, children are closer to their parents. What they want to say to their parents is said naturally. Between father and son, only love can make children not fear and not do things that are clearly deceptive.</p>
<p>Marriage Based on Love</p>
<p>Similarly, the relationship between husband and wife is also based on love. One husband and two wives lacks the principle of Christianity to build a noble and pure family. Marriage is regarded as a sacred union, so the bride and groom must swear an oath of love and cooperation to the end before God and the people. They have the same ideal goal and work together for the happiness of the family. Such a family is built on "loving each other."</p>
<p>The Essence of Friendship Is Also the Same</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between friends, Jesus and Confucianism also have similarities. The two words "loyalty and forgiveness" are the great way of Confucianism. Jesus still speaks the truth of "love". Confucius' friendship is the same as the friendship concept of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, that is, based on the principle of mutual love. Jesus said, "Greater love has no one than this, that he lay down his life for his friends." He also said, "Love your neighbor as yourself." The word "neighbor" here refers to neighbors who are not very familiar. In Jesus' view, the poor are also friends. A missionary is willing to go deep into Africa to serve the semi-civilized nations, be friends with them, and even give their lives for them. This spirit is in line with the teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>Serving the Public, Respecting and Loving Each Other</p>
<p>Regarding the relationship between rulers and subjects, Confucianism was produced in the feudal era, so the ethics of rulers and subjects are naturally suitable. Mencius said, "The people are the most important", which seems suitable for modern democracy. Christianity advocates loving each other, so the principle of mutual respect is adopted between superior and subordinate officials. A small clerk, if he faithfully serves the country and the people, his status is also very respectable, because his personality is noble. According to the Christian explanation, officials in high positions are servants of the people. The name "public servant" was also created by countries that believe in Christianity. Jesus' doctrine also works in countries with kings. If those in power love the people, the people below will naturally love them. Christianity is based on "God is the father of people", so people treat each other as brothers and sisters. Christianity says that humanity and divinity cannot be separated. If there is to be a normal relationship between people, then there must be a normal relationship between people and God. Finally, he introduced the other religions besides the five major religions of the world and finished his lecture.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Letter from Famous British Cartoonist Reports Recent Situation in London <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>A well-known foreign reporter in Shanghai recently received a letter from London from the famous British cartoonist David Low, reporting on Low's personal situation and discussing the German air raids on London. Judging from Hitler's past achievements in air raids, it can be proved that he wants to destroy London, but it is unknown how long it will take. As far as the current situation in London is concerned, St. Paul's Cathedral still stands, and the streets and shops are as lively as ever. The damage inflicted on London by the German planes is actually small. Although Hitler launched an aerial blitzkrieg strategy and repeatedly launched fierce bombings against London, the houses destroyed by the bombings in London are probably still less than 4%. Judging from this efficiency, it is impossible for Hitler to destroy the entire city, let alone conquer the entire country. According to Low, even the current losses suffered by London have cost Hitler a heavy price to achieve. Therefore, it is doubtful whether this aerial blitzkrieg strategy can continue for ten days or so in the future, and whether it can maintain this efficiency. According to Low, the cartoons he made are published in British and American newspapers and are very popular with readers, because they satirize current affairs and contain anti-aggression ideas.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Madam Lei Junyao's Ninetieth Birthday Celebration - Gift Donations All Allocated to Charity, Specially Made Tea Sets as Souvenirs <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Madam Sun Lei of Songjiang, from a family renowned for poetry and propriety, possessed innate filial piety and exceptional talent. She had the ability to memorize anything she read, was quite skilled in poetry, and in middle age, educated her children and managed the household with diligence, frugality, and strictness, earning her a reputation for virtue throughout the countryside. This year, she celebrates her ninetieth birthday, yet her mind remains sharp, her legs and feet nimble. During the day, she can write minuscule characters with ease, and at night, she can read newspaper articles with small print under the lamplight, truly embodying the saying:</p>
<p>“Longevity and health abound.” Madam Lei has three sons and two daughters. The eldest son, styled Junyue, received honors at the township level before reaching adulthood. During the Qing Guangxu period, he served as a writer and editor for this very newspaper for nearly twenty years before retiring due to age. Now at seventy-one years old, he continues to dedicate himself to writing tirelessly. The second son, Junyan, and the third son, Juncui, both graduated from the former Qing Jiangnan Higher School. Since the Republic era, they have served in the education sector, earning renown in their time. As Songjiang suffered from the ravages of war, the entire family sought refuge in Shanghai. On an auspicious day in the latter part of the tenth lunar month, to celebrate Madam Lei's</p>
<p>ninetieth birthday, the descendants planned to hold a family celebration to express their joy and affection. However, Madam Lei sternly refused. Not daring to go against their kind mother's wishes, the descendants recalled that for Madam Lei's seventieth birthday, coinciding with the great flood in the five northern provinces, she had reduced the banquet expenses by three hundred gold pieces and donated it as relief funds. Upon reaching her eightieth birthday, she specially made bowls and chopsticks, distributing them to relatives and friends, using the celebratory gifts received to raise one thousand yuan to build the "Year of Abundance and Longevity Bridge" on the western outskirts of Songjiang for the convenience of travelers. Following the previous example, this time they commissioned the making of tea sets as ninetieth birthday souvenirs, one pot and two cups, to be given to relatives and friends,</p>
<p>marking the family celebration and fostering good fortune for longevity. All gifts such as celebratory screens and candles were politely declined. Any cash gifts received would be entirely donated to charity, directly contributing to extending the lives of others and indirectly accumulating benevolent virtues. It is said that these commemorative gifts have been entrusted to the Saoyeshanfang Bookstore at the intersection of Qipan Street and Baoshan Street in this city for display. Anyone with kinship ties to the Lei family, as well as philanthropists from all walks of life, can directly contact the bookstore. This also embodies the meaning of longevity for oneself and for the world.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Foreign Employees of the Municipal Council to Resume Long Leave <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Since September of last year, the Municipal Council had suspended the granting of long leave to European or Western employees whose home countries were suffering from war. At the beginning of this year, it formulated temporary measures, allowing those employees to spend their long leave in the East. At the same time, the regulations for granting leave were slightly modified, but no one has applied for leave yet. Recently, the council has conducted a thorough review of this matter and decided to resume the long leave system starting from January next year. For those who previously had seven months of leave during the European war period, it will be shortened to six months. The travel destinations should be within the scope approved by the council and travel to Europe is not allowed. The travel allowance will not exceed the amount equivalent to a round-trip economy travel from Shanghai to Montreal, Canada.</p>

<p>The Chinese Women's Temperance Association is a service organization for women in Shanghai. The association has established schools and craft workshops to promote the welfare of women, assist poor women, and promote women's employment. It will hold its annual charity bazaar on November 23rd and 24th. The items for sale include self-made goods, as well as a large number of donations from major companies, department stores, pharmacies, and seed companies. The association is actively preparing for the event, and it is expected to be a grand occasion. It is hoped that all sectors will provide support, especially female compatriots.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Enjoy the Pleasures of Life <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>We should enjoy the pleasures of life while we are living. No matter what kind of work we do, we should always be happy and joyful, only then can we feel the interest in our work. There is an old Chinese saying, "People cannot always be...," which contains truth, because how can a person who is always frowning and bitter-faced succeed? The ancient Greeks also had a saying: "A sound mind in a sound body." Therefore, no matter what we do, we must have a healthy body.</p>
<p>However, no one can escape illness altogether. Not to mention those dangerous and serious diseases, even if there is a little pain! Headache, toothache, rheumatism, neuralgia, or menstrual pain! You will feel extremely painful. With this kind of pain, we feel disappointed because we cannot enjoy entertainment, cannot attend parties, and even watching a movie becomes impossible.</p>
<p>But this pain can be quickly stopped, so there is no need to endure it. The fastest and safest way to relieve pain is to swallow one or two Sanli Tablets. Within ten minutes, the pain will completely subside, and our body will be very comfortable. Sanli Tablets are manufactured by Hoffman Co., Ltd. of Switzerland, so they are absolutely safe and reliable.</p>

<p>No. 3, Lane 363, Road in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>Zhou Qifu, the young master of Zhou Yuanji Cotton Cloth Store, married Chen Jinxia (26 years old this year) as his wife six years ago. Zhou only studied at the elementary level for two years, knows very few characters, while Chen graduated from middle school. The couple often quarrel due to the inequality in their education. Chen advises</p>
<p>her husband to pursue education, but Zhou refuses to listen and instead believes his second sister-in-law's words, repeatedly abusing Chen.</p>
<p>For the sake of self-reliance, Chen not only works as an elementary school teacher during the day, but also works as a private tutor in the evening. Her monthly income is quite</p>
<p>self-sufficient. Because Chen teaches and goes to bed early at night, and gets up early in the morning, Zhou often</p>
<p>enters the room when Chen is fast asleep, and does not get up early in the morning, resulting in the emotions between the two sexes becoming increasingly cold</p>
<p>light. Whenever the couple quarrels, Zhou's second sister-in-law often stands on the same line as Zhou. Chen, unable to bear the heavy abuse, once took sleeping pills</p>
<p>unsuccessful suicide.</p>
<p>Later, Chen left the Zhou family and lived in the school, hoping her husband would repent. However, for more than a year, Zhou has never cared about Chen. Therefore, Chen filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court Civil Division, requesting to divorce Zhou on the grounds that he has no marital affection. Chen said that Zhou Yuanji Cotton Cloth Store often changes the labels of certain goods at night to falsely impersonate domestic goods. Because she is a teacher and cannot participate in the work at night, she cannot</p>
<p>win her husband's favor and is dissatisfied by Zhou's eldest brother. Her incompatibility with the Zhou family is also one of the main reasons, so she has no choice but to seek divorce. The case was tried yesterday by Judge Tao Dejun of Civil Division One. Both parties appeared in court with their respective lawyers. According to the plaintiff Chen's testimony, she narrated the various forms of abuse, which the defendant Zhou</p>
<p>completely denied. The two sides argued for a long time in court. Judge Tao took marriage</p>
<p>with great care</p>
<p>and hoped that both sides would take a step back and reconcile. However, Chen expressed to the court that she would never want to return to the Zhou family. After hearing the case, the court adjourned the case to November 27 for further hearing. During the adjournment, it is hoped that the lawyers of both sides will mediate to allow the two sides to reunite. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>To whom it may concern, I recently read a news item in today's newspaper about a robbery on Nanjing Road, which stated, "A short-dressed bandit fled to the front of the Japanese-owned Lichang Printing House at No. 295, Jiujiang Road," etc. I was deeply surprised. The building at No. 295, Jiujiang Road, is occupied by a company composed of merchants from Sichuan, engaged in transportation, trade, trust, insurance and other businesses. The so-called Japanese-owned and "printing house" are all based on inaccurate inquiries. Therefore, I hereby issue this letter for clarification. It is hoped that you will make corrections. Sincerely, Lichang Co., Ltd., November 15th.</p>

<p>— Pinyin</p>
<p>A telegram from Siberia on the fifth of this month stated that 10,000 wild deer were migrating in the eastern part of the region due to the sudden cold weather that made it impossible for them to survive. This is a common phenomenon in the animal kingdom and is not surprising; but the sight of the migration at that time was quite strange. The telegram reads as follows:</p>
<p>"A large number of wolves followed the deer herd, attacking the weak and sick deer; behind the wolf pack, countless wild rats followed, devouring the remains abandoned by the wolves."</p>
<p>Upon closer examination of this record, I felt that in addition to being strange, I also understood a revelation about a major problem for mankind.</p>
<p>Wild deer—more precisely, reindeer—are the main creatures in cold regions, very docile, and useful. In philosophical terms, they are "good." They migrated for a kind of oppression, but were chased by wolves, and the elderly suffered unnecessary sacrifices. Those wolves truly belong to the "evil" side. Wolves take advantage of the fire to rob and help the tyrant to abuse, and are enemies of the deer. Those wild rats, with their rat-like heads and sneaky eyes, hide behind the evil forces, picking up some leftover flesh and blood to satisfy their greed. They are not only ugly, but also despicable. They hoard rice grains and raise prices, sucking the flesh and blood of civilians in the midst of water and fire. They are the humble rat pack. Oppression and pursuit can be resisted, but can nothing be done about the jumping clowns?</p>
<p>Arise, you who do not want to be slaughtered, fight to the death with all evil forces!</p>

<h3 id="e86">The Forgotten Old Man <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Ling</p>
<p>After two or three days, people simply seemed to have forgotten that such a person ever existed in the world. When the master had leftovers and told the servants, "Pour it out for the old beggar to eat!" the servants would respectfully reply, "Master! He is already dead!"</p>
<p>"Oh! He's already dead!"</p>
<p>Like the end of other small matters, this matter ended in this way.</p>
<p>What kind of person was he after all? He was just a beggar with no place to stand. People called him the old beggar. But he was not an ordinary beggar. According to his thoughts and actions, he could be called "an old patriot" without shame; yet he was eventually forgotten. In the whole alley, my relationship with him was considered the closest. Until now, he still leaves an indelible impression in my mind!</p>
<p>There was a small open space at the entrance of the alley, which was left over when the house was built. In the past, the gatekeeper of the alley built a small wooden house there and lived in it. A year ago, the gatekeeper died, and the wooden house had been empty ever since. One morning, an old beggar was found at the entrance of the alley, shivering on the ground. So everyone "submitted for approval" to the landlord and allowed him to live in the house and serve as the gatekeeper without pay. The families would give him the leftover food, and this had been going on for more than three months.</p>
<p>He, according to himself, was already seventy-four years old. Judging by his appearance, he should be that old. The wrinkles on his face, the white beard, and the seven or eight teeth could all prove that he had lived in this world for more than seventy years. All the children in the alley liked him very much, probably because he could tell stories. When my younger siblings came back after listening to his stories, they all told me that they were very good, even better than the teachers at school. Encouraged by them, on the second night, I also quietly went to listen. He was telling the story of "Yan Yingyuan Defending Jiangyin." His small room was crowded with thirteen or fourteen children, and I was standing outside the door. Not a single child spoke, only his old voice trembled in the west wind, tragic and intense.</p>
<p>"Tell another one! Tell another one!" When he stopped, the children all clamored.</p>
<p>"I won't tell any more! I'm sorry, young masters! How about telling one each day?" he said to the children in a pleading tone.</p>
<p>The children did not object and walked out of his wooden house one by one. In the alley, they were all excitedly telling each other:</p>
<p>"It's really good!"</p>
<p>"Get ready earlier tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"I'll bring cookies to give him tomorrow!"</p>
<p>I walked into his room. He was pouring a cup of cold tea from a broken teapot and drinking it. When he saw me come in, he looked at me with surprised eyes.</p>
<p>"It's really hard for you to tell these stories to the children!"</p>
<p>"Don't mention it! Young master, alas, I'm old! I can't tell the young masters any better stories!"</p>
<p>"Do you have any sons?"</p>
<p>He looked at me, and a tear fell on the table.</p>
<p>"Alas! Poor thing, the eldest son was beaten to death, the youngest son was bombed to death! Leaving me, this miserable old man."</p>
<p>These few words can represent his entire history of blood and tears. I couldn't bear to ask any further. Compassion compelled me, and my hand took out a one-yuan bill from my pocket and stuffed it into his trembling hand.</p>
<p>"Keep this money for your use."</p>
<p>He didn't say anything. After a long time, he blurted out:</p>
<p>"Young master, you are so kind!"</p>
<p>On the evening of National Day, I came home very late. As I walked into the alley, someone grabbed my hand in the darkness, and then a familiar voice sounded:</p>
<p>"Young master! It's me!"</p>
<p>"What?" I shone a flashlight on him.</p>
<p>He quickly took out a one-yuan bill from his pocket - the one I had given him - and also took out a two-jiao bill, five one-jiao bills, and six five-fen bills, and stuffed them all into my palm.</p>
<p>"Please donate this to the country for me."</p>
<p>I was stunned.</p>
<p>"Thank you! Young master! These two yuan in total were saved by me on weekdays. I'm old and don't need them anymore. Please donate them to the country for me!"</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he returned to the small house.</p>
<p>On a windy morning, when I got up, the nanny told me that the old beggar was dead, frozen to death!</p>
<p>Without waiting to put on my clothes, I ran to the small wooden house in two steps. I couldn't see him anymore. Others told me that he had been sent to a certain mountain village. Two tears streamed down my face. A familiar voice rang in my ears again:</p>
<p>"Leaving me, this miserable old man!"</p>
<p>Now, he has long been forgotten by people. Sometimes, when the nannies happen to gather together for a chat, they remember that they haven't poured leftovers for him for a long time.</p>
<p>But he is, after all, a person worthy of praise, even though he is forgotten.</p>

<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Zhao Boxiong's Confession</p>
<p>Zhao Boxiong continued: I lingered outside the low wall for quite a while. Wang Lilan seemed to be doing her best to flatter the raincoat-clad man, and her attitude was very flirtatious. However, as I've said, I didn't see the most important part. I suspect that she handed in that invalid telegram around this time. But I seemed to see that man taking something out and giving it to her before he left. Then I saw him back out.</p>
<p>"My original intention was to deal with this shameless woman, but when I got to that point, I changed my mind on the spot. I planned to first take a look at the true face of this raincoat-clad man, and if possible, I also wanted to find out his whereabouts. Therefore, when he backed out, I still hid in the open space next door to the west, and I saw that the man was not very old, and he had some short whiskers on his upper lip. As soon as he went out, he turned east at the corner of Datong Road."</p>
<p>Hawthorn suddenly picked up the paper cutter and held it up, saying: "Slow down, we had a doubt at the time that was not easy to explain. Since she was so solicitous towards that raincoat-clad man, it would be reasonable for her to see him off, but in fact she didn't. I know that after you waited for that raincoat-clad man to come out, you also peeked into that reception room again. I think you can explain this mystery of why she didn't see him off, right?"</p>
<p>The young old man nodded and said, "Yes, I also thought at the time that she would see him off, but in the end, I only saw him coming out alone; therefore, I was a little surprised, so I took another look. It turned out that there was another guest in the room at that time, so she couldn't see her employer out."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but say in surprise: "Another guest? How did he get in? Could it be from the back door?"</p>
<p>Hawthorn suddenly looked up at me and said, "Bao Lang, no. This guest was already in the house, so he didn't need to enter through the front or back door."</p>
<p>Zhao Boxiong nodded quickly and said: "Yes, yes. In a glimpse, I saw Lilan's husband, Li Zhiban, with a cigarette in his mouth, already walking into the reception room. Lilan was opening the window and pulling back the curtains. I understood the reason why she didn't see him off, and because I wanted to track down the person wearing the raincoat, I hurried back to the car and drove around the corner. When I entered Datong Road, the man's car had already driven far away. After chasing for two blocks, I stopped again, and in the end, I lost hope. I had to return to Qingpu Road again and parked the car in the original place. At that time, the raindrops were much smaller. I went to the outside of the low wall again to take a look. The lights in the guest room were still bright, the window was also open, and Lilan was sitting behind the desk. The old man seemed to be no longer in the room. I thought this was a good opportunity that should not be missed! So I aimed at her heart and fired a shot, and then I quietly returned to the car and drove back to Yadong." (167)</p>

<p>— Zhisu</p>
<p>Engaging in the Arrangement of Meaningful New Plays</p>
<p>The establishment of the Shanghai Drama School has continued a good lineage for the future of Peking Opera. Although the school has been established for less than a year, under the efforts of the hosts and teachers, the results have been remarkable. Now, the school stipulates that performances be held at the Golden Grand Theater every Wednesday and Saturday. The performances of that group of little angels have been praised by many.</p>
<p>I once saw their "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "Yang Xiangwu Steals the Nine Dragon Cups." The children's skilled and brilliant performances and singing are truly worthy of praise. Generally speaking, the school has already achieved the goal of preserving the inherent essence of the old dramas, but this is also a pity; because in this great era, the advocacy of drama is not just about providing entertainment to the audience. In addition to entertainment, it must also give the audience education. Drama is the best tool for education, especially the Shanghai Drama School, which cultivates future stage newcomers, who are different from ordinary actors, and of course it is hoped that they will take on the responsibility of educating the masses through the power of drama. Now, looking at the plays performed by the Shanghai Drama School, they are almost purely old dramas, and at the same time, the selection of scripts does not seem to have undergone strict consideration. For example, the chivalrous heroism of "Yang Xiangwu Steals the Nine Dragon Cups" may be advocated, but plays like "Qingshi Mountain" that exaggerate gods and monsters are inevitably close to superstition, and it seems that there is no need to introduce them.</p>
<p>Of course, the original essence of the old dramas must be preserved on the one hand, but on the other hand, meaningful new dramas should also be created. It is impossible to expect the general professional actors to realize this task (except for a few actors with progressive ideas), and the Shanghai Drama School was born in this great era, and what is cultivated is a group of future stage newcomers, who can take on this great responsibility, create new life for the drama industry, and open up a new road.</p>
<p>I think that the Shanghai Drama School should first organize a scriptwriting committee, recruit experts who have always studied drama, and engage in the arrangement of new dramas with the meaning of the times, to create rich dramas with new ideas in the old form. For example, the famous dramas "Ge Nunniang" and "Hai Guo Yingxiong" are very valuable and can be adapted into Peking Opera. (In addition, "Ningwuguan" and "Fighting the Jin Soldiers," etc., can also be re-edited.)</p>
<p>To put it bluntly: if you don’t engage in the creation of new plays, and always sing the same old and decaying plays such as "Yu Tangchun," "Er Jin Gong," and "Si Lang Visits His Mother," who will "appreciate" it decades later?</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the Shanghai Drama School can make good use of its current superior position and shoulder this extraordinary mission.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Yan Yueleng's Activities <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Xingxing</p>
<p>Yan Yueleng, mentioning her, everyone shouldn't feel too unfamiliar, right? She is Yan Yuexian's younger sister, playing Du Shiniang's friend, also a prostitute, in "Du Shiniang."</p>
<p>She is still a newcomer in the film industry, having just joined Guolian in March of this year. After completing "Du Shiniang," her new work is "Qian Nü Huan Hun" (The Reincarnation of Qian Nü), co-starring with Chen Yanyan and others, which is adapted from "Tragedy on the Lake." Speaking of Yueleng appearing on the screen, "Du Shiniang" was not her first attempt. As early as when Lianhua Film Company was filming "Yu Guang Qu" (Song of the Fishermen) starring Wang Renmei, she participated, and her youngest sister, Yuemei, also played a role. In order to shoot outdoor scenes, she even went to Ningbo with Wang Renmei and others. Later, she also made a guest appearance in Guohua, filming "Yemingzhu" (Night-Shining Pearl) with her sister Yan Yuexian.</p>
<p>So, in total, this "Qian Nü You Hun" is Yan Yueleng's fourth work to appear on the screen. Originally, the role she was to play in "Qian Nü Huan Hun" was the older sister of Chen Yanyan's character, but later the director felt that Yueleng was young, and playing Yanyan's older sister did not seem very suitable. So it was decided to change the role, removing the older sister role and changing it to Chen Yanyan's younger sister. This change, of course, could not have been more appropriate, so "Qian Nü Huan Hun" was able to proceed actively and smoothly.</p>
<h3 id="e91">New Discovery in "Women" Miss Gu Han Active in the Art Scene <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Tieliu</p>
<p>Miss Gu Han, who had been silent for a long time, was discovered in the China Travel Troupe's play "Women." Long-term performances in drama can be said to have been pioneered by the Red Star Theater in the spring of last year, but it was a flash in the pan, and it soon ceased. Miss Gu Han of Red Star successively performed "The Imperial Envoy," "Sunrise," "Ren Zhi Chu" (The Beginning of Man), and other plays, winning considerable praise. Someone who knew her background published the elegant title "Director's Miss" for her in the newspaper. This magazine also published an interview with her, including text and photos.</p>
<p>After Red Star closed, Gu Han's name was still often found in newspapers, saying that she was going to appear on the screen. When Yi Hua was producing "Wang Baochuan," she competed for the role of Princess Daizhan, but as a result, it was played by Diao Banhua. It did not become a reality, although she was highly appreciated by director Wu Cun. After this setback, it was later rumored that she had joined Xinhua and would perform in "Xi Shi," but for some reason, it did not come to fruition. And the role of Liu Xuangu in Hezhong's "Wen Suchen" was also considered for her before Yang Wenying was decided upon. As time went on, Gu Han's name gradually faded. But someone discovered that she had served as a drama instructor at a certain tutorial school.</p>
<p>Now, the China Travel Troupe is performing "Women," a play performed entirely by women, and it has been discovered that the long-studying Tian Xiulan's role is natural and without excessive enthusiasm. Her footsteps have been extensive, and her life experience is naturally rich. Her speech is clear and bright. Now she is once again active in the art scene, adding a unique touch to the China Travel Troupe. Tang Huaiqiu can be considered to have had a very discerning eye.</p>
