<p>東京　今日外務省反復申述日本反英美協定授權美國海軍使用新加坡根據地、其意顯係恐懼美國對日侵越之報復、據外務省發言人須磨今日對記者所稱、我人以為當今局勢、不能許可此種行動、英美協定、旣未顧及日本利益、要難發生效力、」須磨又稱、「河內會議昨日巳獲協定、依照條款、日本一切軍事動作、凡足用以中國事件之解決者、法國當局均當允准、至上星期日晚、日軍侵入越時、法日軍隊發生衝突、實由法方未將河內協定卽刻通知當地法軍所致、吾人對於越南、實無領土野心、亦無激起事件之故意、吾人之所正盼者、唯河內協定之和平實施耳抑此協定、旣由和平會商致成、別國宜難有所反對、」然據此間中立觀察家所信河內協定之成立、由日本威脅所致、英美對日、或將更作進一步之反對也、所謂進一步之反對、卽美國接受英國建議、使用新加坡海軍根據地也、（二十三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>同登法日衝突停止　傳法軍被解除武裝</p>
<p>東京　日陸軍總司令部頃稱、被日軍解除武裝之法軍、卽係昨晚抵抗日軍進入越南之軍隊、同登之法軍被繳械後、法日軍隊在邊境之軍事行動巳停止、（二十三日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>越南協定簽字之後</h3>
<p>隔昨，本月二十二日下午三時，日本代表西原與法屬越南總督德古，簽訂協定。</p>
<p>越南夙有日僑二百餘名，多小商人，越南與日本間，本無何種懸而不決之糾紛，堪稱問題。自日本對法國提出要求，希望滇越鐵路對中國停止運輸戰時用品，所謂問題自此始。在法國，以為委屈可以求全，妥協可以解紛，唾面何難自乾，要求何妨接受；大事化小，小事化無，問題自此消弭矣。在日本，以為怯弱是侵略之對象，得寸是進尺之梯堦；豈但無事生事，信手拈來皆成問題，抑且更有大塊文章。於是繼滇越路停運之後者，要挾百出，猙獰萬狀，卒訂協定如隔昨。協定條款，紀本日新聞欄，茲不贅為紹介。在法國，謂「越南與日本之眞誠合作。當可因而奠定基礎」，又謂「茲本誠意與相互尊重之心，樹立友好關係，原屬情理之常，且與越南經常利益互相適合」；作此說明者，越督德古；法國軍人夙有豪爽勇敢之榮譽，德古允軍人而中將階級者也。在日本，同意承認「越南之完，整，以及法國在越南之主權」此說可信出之於日本之任何人，亦世界任何人所願報之以會心之微笑。吾人於此，不必再加詮釋，無須更予揭穿，世人當能洞悉今後之越甫，竟是誰家之天下。</p>
<p>溯自一九三一年之九月十八日以來，日本開始其對外之各種發動，於今已逾九載；竭其三軍之全力，罄其官民之財富，苦戰亦逾一年；在法理上可稱收穫者，僅此越南協定；收穫之豐，殆亦無逾於此越南協定。法國敗於德，戰敗也；屈於義，勢屈也；德義兩國以國命民脈為孤注而所得於法國之所簽諾者，一紙停戰協定而已；此後與此外，舉未可知也。當然，維希諸公終未必厚於日本而薄於德義，德義終亦未必僅事火中取栗以饗日本；而日本今茲所得，究竟是既香且腴而終得安然消化之火爆甘栗歟，抑所含為埋伏導火綫之炸彈歟、僅此一紙越南協定，殊未必能為之保障千秋也。</p>
<p>事之未必者，至少有兩可；法國與德義間，終將何似，其前途錯雜紛繁，姑措勿論。論越南事，亦有有關德義者：其一，據各方面所推測，以及日本方面非正式之所透露，謂日本之有取於越南，德義實曾抑勒法國而為日本張目云；此說自有若干理由，可資置信；然以國際之譎詐，則在德義對於越南問題自始迄今未嘗正式有何表示之際，縱有可資置信之理由，仍應保留充分懷疑之餘地。蓋日本要挾越南之主要藉口，在於取得侵略中國之軍事便利；德國對日本，雖於甚多之方面，假日本以辭色，然在日本侵華問題之範圍之內，實未嘗犧牲中德兩國間良好之友誼，而予日本以何種鼓勵；故此决之日本行動，吾人猶不欲輕信德國對於中德友誼乃作明確之拋棄；同時以中德友誼為出發點，亦應靜待德國明確之一言，以為佐證。其二，假定德義關於日本之脅迫法屬越南，確予日本以支持，則德義與日本之間，必然附有相當之條件；條件內容不必問，然得魚忘筌，違信背義，國際慣見之矣，則日本於取得越南協定後，果將出以履行條件之舉動乎？貌似履行，顧有其眞誠乎，有其力量乎？若曰不然，則日本以依附於德義之姿態而有獲於越南者，不將以德義失望於被欺而予越南協定以何種影響乎？此皆兩可而未必然者也。</p>
<p>闢開德義之一環以論越南協定，則中國宣言在先，即中國為自衛計，不能坐視法國拋棄其對於中日戰爭之第三國地位，予中國以不利而予對方以方便。雖中國於法日簽訂協定，日軍在越登陸後，固將採取何種行動，非所逆覩；然中國有取任何重要行動之最大可能，是可斷言；惟其如此，更因地理上歷史上，法人越人與華僑之感情與利害關係上，發為有力且有效之軍略行動，必予紙上協定以事實上之影響。此可注意於今後者，一也。英國有緬甸以及為新加坡軍港母體之馬來半島，與越南為鄰；此决日本圖越南，雖曰對華，要在對英，其中之進退得失，勢力消長，乃為英帝國在東方之根基關鍵，絕非彈丸之香港關係所得方其重要之萬一；證以英國於抗德之百忙之中，於渴望與日本保持僅存之交誼之際，顧在越南協定簽字前，以法理上僅居第三國之地位，而竟對日本提出抗議，可知英國已能確認越南局勢，實與英國有直接之痛切關係；今越南協定簽字矣，法國一屈再屈，日本劍及屨及，謂英國反而默爾而息乎？謂英國抗議等於官樣文章，聊盡人事而不計實效乎？邱吉爾非張伯倫而儼然兩時代，此非癬疥之疾而為肢解之厄，然則英國固將如何？即使不作何種有力且有效之行動，而僅繼之以冠冕堂皇之解嘲，其措辭將如何煞費苦心，始得為國際之奇文乎？此可注意於今後者，二也。至於美國，在越南成為問題之二三月來，再三表示其維護現狀之決心，直至越南協定簽字之前夕，絕未絲毫放鬆；夫謂為僅以披露其對於弱者法國之同情，實為越南局勢，所關於菲列賓安危，所關於英國命運，所關遠東與太平洋前途者，既遠大且深刻也。借用新加坡與香港之舉，自不失為軍略上之重要布局；然止於布局，何裨實際？何足遏猖披而弭危機？美國有堅定强毅之國策，吾人深知之矣；凡所作為之有莫大力量，有必然功效，吾人深信之矣；然事至今日，簽的也，登陸也，一一嘲弄之於美國之面前；美國之必有作為，作為之必使越南協定受其影響，誠無問題，問題乃在如何作為？何時作為？此可注意於今後者，三也。世界大局，正在光明與黑暗劇鬭之中，而黑暗之開展較廣較速，愈演愈烈；自越南協定簽字，日軍在越登陸、是劇鬭延長與擴大之重要樞紐也；蘇聯是大局中之要角，而凡百黑暗勢力，不問目前染何彩色，播何烟慕，其根性終是極端的反蘇陣營，謂蘇聯仍將依然自居局外，坐視其膨脹乎？不坐視，將如何與美國相諧，如何對中國力助，左提右挈，豈可以緩。此可注意於今後者，四也。越南協定對於中日兩國之對抗力量，各無所增損，故越南之為日軍控制也，絕非中國多一被侵之方面，蓋世界多一禍患之窟穴也，總淸算之時期至矣，大光明在望矣乎！</p>

<h3>歐戰業談（十）（二）　希特勒凱旋記</h3>
<p>希特勒於七月六日自巴黎凱旋，榮歸柏林，上里郊迎，舉巿騰歡，殊典盛况，凱撒不如。戰爭最後勝負雖尙未分曉，但德國自受凡爾賽和的之束縛，奮鬥二十二年，始有這揚眉吐氣之一日，無怪希特勒在向來嚴霜封閉着似的臉上，這天居然也笑容可掬，一切舉止，輕鬆而活潑了。當天柏林各報標題，尊他為世界歷史上殲滅戰中最偉大的勝利者……戰之神……軍事天……大政治家，最高領袖之總匯……一九四〇年之戰勝者，駕一九一八年戰勝者而上之……八千萬人民之領袖……由黑暗而達光明的領袖，極誇大諂諛的能事。茲將紐的泰晤士報駐柏林訪員所記當時盛况如下：</p>
<p>希特勒於七月六日下午三時許，從前綫返抵柏林漢爾特恩車站，航空部長戈林上將及政府各高級官吏均在站迎迓。希特勒所乘特掛花車，係由懸旗機車兩輛拖曳，並有高射砲車兩輛沿途護衛。車站月台上舖有紅色地毯，文武官員依官銜高下，分列左有，站班恭迎。希特勒下車之時，首由戈林等上前握手歡迎。戈林本來軀體肥胖，雍腫不靈，自從兩個月的戰事以來，騁馳疆塲，倒也略見淸　，格外精神奕奕了。隨希特勒下車的為國防軍總司令季台爾將軍，和外交部長里賓特洛甫等人。月台上紅地毯之外，在地面上還有一個用松針，冬靑，紅藍花朶等綴成的銀灰色大鐵十字勳章，以表揚國社黨領袖的偉大功業。</p>
<p>希特勒剛從花車步入月台，全柏林敎堂鐘聲鏗鏘，直至他到達總理府時纔停止。他與左右站班的各官員頷首為禮，並受國社黨靑年團的歡迎敬禮，在衝鋒隊軍樂聲中，步入輛開敞篷車；這時候對面月台上的靑年團和少女團振吭高呼「勝利……勝利……」不止，一路把這兩字傳出來，聲浪此起彼伏，直到汽車開走始巳。月台上燈炬輝耀，車站門口紮了彩坊，旗幟飄蕩，花葉展招，打扮得十分鮮艷奪目。從站門通至大街的扶梯欄干，用斛葉編結成為金帶花環，象徵勝利的光榮。街道上由禁衛隊警戒，全體武裝，三步一崗。個個都是雄糾糾，威風異常。</p>
<p>從車站到總理府一英里長的街道上，兩旁人山人海，都是歡迎希特勒的柏林市民。宣傳部長郭培爾於那天早上卽通吿柏林的男女老幼，耍他們以至誠的表示去歡迎元首。叫他們個個跑到街上來，瞻仰元首風采。因之大道兩旁的熱閙情形，眞非筆墨所得形容。事前，德國無錢電台也曾警吿居民，元首乘車經過柏林各街道時，不得向之擲花，一切所獻的花須於車輛駛經之前，置於路上。少女團和警士等早在三時之前，把玫瑰等鮮花散游街道，一路錦繡芬芳，蔚為異觀。</p>
<p>早上七時起，在陽光曦微之下，已經有許多男女在道旁等候，他們帶了紙袋裹所裝的食物，權作早餐和午膳。國社黨黨員，在路旁分發卐字小旗。售賣冰洪淋的小販，供不應求，出售的冰乳酪，量以噸計。更有出售簡便望遠鏡箱者，亦莫不利市三倍。馬路交又點的電桿上裝置有無綫電揚聲筒。凡是道遠或是擠不上馬路邊去觀看的人，儘可從無錢電播音中聆取一切熱鬧情形。</p>
<p>（右）凱旋時柏林盛</p>
<p>（上）法德停戰協定簽字後希特勒與戈林等留影</p>
<p>（左）沿途少女散花歡迎</p>
<p>希特勒的汽車前面有一輛攝製帘影片的汽車，後面為戈林的車子，一個人坐了一輛。再後面為政府高級官員分坐數事。外國通訊社訪員合坐一車，各官吏大家身着戎裝，十足表示武力征服他國的精神。其中祇有經濟專家沙赫德博士穿了便服，和國社黨理論家魯森堡博士同坐一車。馬路中行列間遊行的，還有幾千個男女工人，前面由國社黨軍官引導，軍樂之聲不絕於耳。靑年團和少女團也參加其間。據警廳估計，遊行的人數不下二十萬之衆。</p>
<p>下午三時十六分，希特勒的汽車抵達總理府門首。門口有一隊儀仗隊站着，預備元首去檢閱，但是希特勒並沒有下車，祇在車上答他們的敬禮。並有幾個從前綫回來的傷兵排列的等着。車子一到，其中一人跑至車前，與希特勒握手致敬。四分鐘之後，希特勒出現於總理府大厦陽台，這時候萬衆歡呼，樂隊奏着國社黨黨歌。羣衆咸引吭高聲附唱。興奮之餘，大家高聲歡呼自不必說，其中竟有喜極而泣下的呢。</p>
<p>希特勒在陽台時，隨侍的有戈林上將，陸軍總司令白拉傑區將軍，海軍總司令賴特上將，里賓特洛甫和黨副總理赫斯。當希特勒舉臂向羣衆答禮時，大家高歌「我們進攻英倫」之曲。因為天熱人多，加以極度的興奮，婦女們竟有多人昏厥。幸而紅十字女看護等早就預備着，冋昏厥者大澆冷水。希特勒在陽台看了一會卽行退去。</p>
<p>羣衆仍舊沒有散去，在三時三十七分時，無綫電揚聲筒報吿說：「大家注意。元首將再與諸君一面：請大家稍侍卽散去」。三時五十五分，希特勒又在陽台上出現，戈林立在左側。大約一三分鐘，他叉進去了。揚聲筒立刻叫衆人散去，於是民衆便逐漸四散，至是，一日盛况遽爾消逝。</p>

<h3>金融　港方拋出鉅額美匯　本市英美匯兌做高</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、均無變動、英美匯暗市、潛勢由緊而鬆後則吿穩、結果英平美略硬化、乃以當天消息利空、如中蘇英美四國將在遠東採取一致行動、並將積極經濟援華訊、開後、卽起賣風、加之某華行代港方傾吐九十月期、美匯達五十餘萬元之鉅、一度鬆至三辦士半及五元三四三七五、午刻賣者陡　、爲狀稍轉、後市因有日軍在越南登陸訊、投機商轉扒美金二十萬元、致五元三一二五、一度難結、但幸美行尙有供意、故無影響、結果、以三辦士四八四三七五及五元三一二五收盤、較上週六英平、美硬〇六二五、而美英匯兌亦由三元六角三分、做高達三元六角九分半、最後三元六角九分左右、交易極旺、</p>
<p>出口商亦有塞出</p>
<p>晨初以海外匯兌英對美仍平、對滬縮〇六二五、美對英未更、對滬降二分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士四八四三七五、美匯五元二一八七五、較之週末、英平美緊〇三一二五、開後英滙亦曾軟至三辦士四六八七五、但不久出口商忽來拋出九月期先令、且某美行亦有供意、市面頓形轉穩、計洋行售予外行九月份英金三辦士四八四三七五、及某行賣予同行九月份灸匯五元二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後某華行突代港方力賣鉅額美滙、是以市面反吿鬆動、惟英金爲狀較定、計華行售予外行九月期美滙由五元二八一二五硬至三四三七五、並十月期美匯五兀二五與一三一二五、十一時後港電亦來拋塞英金、是時英金亦硬、計港電售予外行現先令三辦士半、同時某行吐予華行及同行九月份美滙爲五元三四三七五、十二時半後、賣者减少、情勢略形回平、迄收盤、英金爲三辦士四八四三七五、美匯計五元三一二五、</p>
<p>午後市勢稍轉穩</p>
<p>後市狀態轉靜、交易减少、僅聞投機家稍有撈進計扒入大通及其他外行月紛美匯五元三一二五、並十月份美匯五元三一二五、及二八一二五、爲狀似稍帶軟、入後外行尙肯吐賣、而扒者亦减、遂吿回平、迨晚收銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士四八四三七五、美匯五元三一二五、十月期英金三辦士四六八七五、美匯五元二八一二五、結果比上週末、現期英平美硬〇六二五、</p>

<h3>太平洋前途有利中國　金市跌風驟起</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、經上週連漲數天之金市、而、週初驟起回風、原因盛傳中蘇英美在遠東方面、將採取聯合五助行動、並聞再以經濟援華、因之多戶心悸、放出急迫、而浮空乘機作勢、反來加碼、雖某錢兌業獨出一志、不斷在吸、但終無濟於事、晨開仍爲六千二百八十元、嗣雖晋達六千二百九十元高價、但此後金號幫多頭猛烈出籠、浮多跟之了結、並聞滙市步鬆、退於六千二百四十元內時、更缺乏買戶維持、立慘入六千二百元大關、最低見六千一百七十五元、午收尙穩爲六千二百元、後市走勢轉佳、浮空抵補、初開六千二百二十元、二度好至六千二百四十元、結果以六千二百二十三元收盤、較上週六軋跌五十七元、全天交易的四千兩之譜、銀樓飾金不動、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤挫五十七元</p>
<p>晨初滙市略軟、但人心不一、金號幫頗有賣胃、致價靴提升、首由金號互做二十兩、仍爲六千二百八十元、較週末無分榮辱、開後錢兌業稍進、曾抬至六千二百九十元、奈此後金號幫力資、且某銀號猛塞、代客拋空、加之不久滙市步硬、並傳有某種利空消息、雖某錢兌業及銀號幫居間吸收、立退至六千二百四十元、後雖站定、盤旋於六千二百五六十元之間、但卒因金號幫愈賣愈力、迨十一時許遂慘入六千二百元大關、銀號對做三十兩、遜爲六千一百七十五元、午刻賣者减少、某錢兌業不遺餘力、再來在抱、收盤前曾回升至六千二百十兀、惟收盤卒爲六千二百元、午後開市、人心稍轉、於買風下卽抬起</p>

<p>電話　九一一二一　九一六二六</p>
<p>二十元、金號進銀號二十兩、爲六千二百二十元、嗣經金號補空、再升達六千二百四十元、此後某錢兌業多頭稍　、加之金號幫斯時反來賣出、復小至六千二百〇五元、旋滙市稍軟、兼傳越南某種利多消息、重漲至六千二百四十元、入後散戶及銀號吐出、迨收盤則爲六千二百二十三元、結果比上日軋跌五十七兀、全天一百十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金尚未掛小</p>
<p>銀樓飾余每兩兌出、依然不動、大同行仍懸六百四十元原價、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>處幣一致下落</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、因烚赤盤旋下趨、英美金鎊因亦各降一元五角、英金票需要略减、市價微降二角半、美金票漲卽跌、晨初曾高至十九元、旋因謠傳中美蘇三國有締結軍事同盟訊、以致各方供給暢盛、一度退至十八兀六角七分、卒爲十八元七角四分、比上週六軋跌一角六分、香港票需要較滯、市價略軟、日金票初仍繼續挺漲、午後步落、終降一分、晚市退爲一元五角一分、朝鮮票供給稍旺、市價略軟、晚市退爲一元一角七分、</p>
<h3>拆息續升一分　巾現頻小不已</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、跌勢未止、反形擴大、上午每千元貼進爲廿元、貼出廿三元、下午續小至廿二元、貼進僅廿元、比上週六竟再小二元、錢業公會拆息又續升一分、達一角二分、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米到源不絕　米商借題發揮</h3>
<p>昨洋米被越南問題擴充之影響、貨方乃藉端宣傳、借以抬價扳俏、而盲從浮戶莫不爭先吸收、搶帽子交易又應運而生、故早市洋米價騰漲達二元之鉅，旋被獲利多頭出籠、午市回平一元、結果祇較大一元左右、安南粳竟閒七十元半、然英華司原包二號西貢已趁機扳俏至七十七元、二號暹邏扳至七十六元半、的有一百多噸成交、現貨有投機活躍成交達八九千包之多、</p>
<p>洋米來源不斷、太古公司濟南輪前日（星期日）到滬由香港裝六千四百七十一包、停靠法租界本行碼頭起卸、昨已完竣、（租）</p>
<p>糯米來源受阻、本街稍有勸動、市加元許、開金溧特元七十元至六十八元二角、常丹白元六十九元半至六十八元、香港特元六十九元半至六十八元、厚薄破粳等國米、來源續阻、因洋米見挺、而實銷微動、故行市隨起近元、計開常幫特粳七十九元六角至七十八元普通七十六七元、無常蘇崑粳、高七十八元牛、决至七十四元八角、靑浦薄破七十九元至七十八元、南港早破原包好七十六元至七十五元半、斛見七十三元半至七十三元、</p>

<h3>麵粉再升　已見十八元新高價　洋麥到一萬七千噸</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日愈形緊俏、因本客銷化均佳、現貨不敷供給、二號粉正牌廠盤再加半元、改爲十六元五角、而廠棧單又有囤戶吸收、籌碼枯竭、創十八元新高峯、米麵兩種同趨高漲、日廠粉因運入租界困難、現粉供應日蹙、期粉交易仍停、洋粉以多數轉口華北、滬市存粉居奇、洋砲台及福壽牌價叩十九元大關、市面漲風、正方興未艾、小麥昨日交易、仍未暢旺因近來內地到貨久稀、申地存底亦薄、售手心意頗堅、惟日廠進意平淡、華廠以自定洋麥有到、亦不亟亟需要、故市面無大進展、聞日廠華廠收進各麥二三千包、售價比前略緊、</p>
<p>大量洋麥連續到滬、天祥洋行經理之挪輪Vito號、自澳洲運來八千餘噸、於上週二（十七日）到埠、停泊十四十五號浮筒起卸、的今日可卸淸、昨日叉有該行經理之Astorla號亦由澳洲裝來八千餘包、於昨日下午五時許抵滬、停泊八〇九號浮筒、今日開始起卸、兩船共的一萬七千噸、（祖）</p>
<h3>證券　法越屈服於日　外股市價猛騰　內債頻見上漲</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況繼續趨漲、惟午後因無稽之謠、曾一度稍稍回低、但人氣仍極堅强、大戶祇有加碼、散戶時有多顯結出、脚地極爲穩定、消息方面、英美蘇經濟物質上之援助中國、愈見有力、中國對外交通路綫、又有新創建、但其最大因素、仍係游資由充斥而至汜濫、乃有無法運用之苦痛、銀行存息實行减低、卽其有力之明證、此種游資顯已有一部份投資公債、故公債經此實力之培植、其欣欣向榮勢所必然、咋日上午、二十五號買進最湧、恒孚及潤德進胃亦頗不弱、散戶零星收買亦多、聯益永豐多頭稍有出脫、同康先賣後買、市價午收卽好牛元上落、午後初開極堅、丙秤曾做六元、後以散戶紛紛求售、聯益久豐復有出脫、二十五號則始終買進、同順需要丙戍兩種亦甚熱鬧、午後行市比較稍弱、但戊丁兩種則繼續趨堅、結果續漲二三角至五角半不等、成交總數共計的一百廿餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交中華書局股四十五股、價爲三十一元五角、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨日股市開盤、對於日軍進入越南事不甚重視、價格穩定非凡、後因電傳法日已在河內成立協定、買方乘機大肆活動，各股價格猛騰、至多時未覯之新高峯、信和紗廠股之蓬勃、對於整個市况受益非淺、該股晨初在七元二角左右價、有大枇多戶出籠、俱被盡量吸收、下午轉趨高翔、收盤竟漲至八元四角半高價、橡皮股雖無實業股之蓬勃、但亦堅挺非凡、昨日各股成交總額之鉅、業已多時未見、</p>
<p>倫敦廿日（週五）電（遲到）、中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、均吿平滯、行情概無上落、</p>

<h3>紗花　組紗港銷續暢</h3>
<p>紗市局勢尚昂、但新買者雖不乏人、然大都皆抱搶帽子心思交易爲多數、所以形勢表面非常堅挺、實際上無甚力道也、因爲價格稍高、如能獲利、旋卽出擋、籌碼一鬆、市盤迅跌、反之則升、不過目前香港方面、需要不斷、多方意志強壯、然每日買去的有一千包、但均係指定牌子之紗居多數、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣尙和善、二十支雙馬開價爲一千〇十三元、少頃搶帽子之輩一齊搶進、因金子價高、漲至一千〇十八元、此價迴旋殊久、因香港幫現銷仍有一千包、而粗紗售價甚緊、所以市價堅硬、而檯面上亦鬧猛異常、收盤價爲一千〇十六元、詎料收盤後　金價一霎間在落、人心稍虛、跌去六七元、雙馬價爲一千〇十元、查半日間成交統計二千六百八十五包、行情一十支雙馬平平、昨日出口棉紗有十件遝香港、四百五十五件運暹雜、今日尙有九百五十五件運香港、八十五件運厦門、茲將各幫口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>香　〇九五同行一五八〇</p>
<p>統計二六八五</p>
<h3>棉花轉昂　長織維尤為俏俐</h3>
<p>現棉生意雖無　批成交、然人心較昔爲緊昂、此因新棉年景雖吿豐稔、然來源不爽、因之棉商態度爲佳、不過紗市漲力仍缺、廠方對於高價亦不吸收也、惟同業買賣、較爲起色、售價無大變化、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市市況先因缺乏重要買戶、後因棉區氣候良好、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌落三五磅音、印度昨日連同預測好半羅比餘</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來市上長綫維之現貨日缺、然三十二支之棉紗問詢者頗多、廠方因之有意購買此項原棉、故日來甚爲俏俐也、同業俱深悉原棉到埠日稀、心思甚堅、對棉市一致望漲也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　紗價步俏　布廠盤上升</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市以原紗俏俐、影響成本、廠盤步緊、惟現銷仍乏大量發展、散額交易、尙形熱鬧、售盤粗細布斜紋漲一二角、色布·色斜漲二角半至五角、漂布印花布絨布平平、本街成交各布五百餘件、粵港幫辦色布色斜粗布斜紋等三百餘件、浙閩幫辦色斜粗布等一百數十件，北路烟台靑島幫辦組布絨布綫呢等一百數十件、</p>
<p>東布　昨本街染銷活動、售盤繼續上升、白貨中下擋細布及細斜驟漲每疋五角至七角半、阿部市洋行訂出十二磅陽鶴細布　價每疋廿八元、龍頭細布晨市以黄金下挫、投機交易看軟而跌至卅二元七角半、後市因中擋價好、跟漲至卅二元九角收盤、四君干嗶嘰九角四分、直貢允缺佾、已喊高每碼一元外矣、</p>
<p>出口　查疋頭運往外埠者、計一十三日一百零五件、運往香港、又一百四十件、運往暹羅、今日亦有二百四十五件、運往厦門、四百零五件運香港、四十一件運新加坡、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價微有上落</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢穩定、上落互見、惟爲數不多、公會劃盤現貨二四組白本棧八十元〇五角、升一角、老貨七十八元半、外棧新貨八十元、轉口貨見軟爲六十四元、荷棉白TML嘜七十七元二角、小一角、KD嘜七十六元、荷赤初爲六十二元九角至六十三元、後爲六十三元三角、太古車白B嘜七十七元半、小五角、DY嘜七十五元至七十五元半、升五角、HX嘜七十五元至七十五元四角、升四角、本廠晶明冰糖爲九十九元、升元半、廿三日自香港運來糖一百二十包、厦門來二百包、</p>
<h3>油餅　食油投機　致力於期貨</h3>
<p>昨日油市潛勢平庸、來源仍接、現油銷　不暢、但一般做手，大都致力於期貨投機、故在後市略帶微緊、共計做開膠州豆油一百十件、價爲七十三元、烟岐豆油五十件、價爲七十五九、大連凈豆油六百擔、價爲八十元、大有廠豆油三百擔、八十一元至八十一元五角、膠州生油二百五十件、六十七元五角至六十八元五角、路貨二百件、六十七元七角半、十月上交八百件、價爲六十七元五角至六十八元七角半、十月下交九百件、六十八元七角半至七十元、烟臺生油五十件、六十七元、靑島生油一百三十桶、九十四元五角至九十五元、</p>
<p>雜糧二十四日豆子出口、運夏門五百六十八包、運香港一百二十包、運新加坡四十包、又豆餅二千四百八十塊運新加坡、生油二百件運厦門、七百聽運香港、二十三日有豆餅七百塊運暹邏</p>

<h3>可憐的老囚犯</h3>
<p>— 紀曹</p>
<p>在浙東的時候，我一直住在朋友張律師家中，因爲時常跟他到法院裹去旁聽，所以懂得了不少法律上的故事。一天，我看到一個企圖逃獄的老囚犯，他在「不幸的命運」中，父被警察抓住了；現在，他重父讓法官加上一條「逃犯」的罪名。</p>
<p>那景像眞是令人不堪卒視，誰能猜釗那怪可憐的老囚犯，是犯了什麼罪？他底頭髮，差不多完全白了，額上横列着很深的皺縫，眼光又是那樣的失神，羸瘦孱弱的整個軀體，沒有一部份不在作顫抖。他用乞憐似的眼光，掃射四週，任何人都願還以同情的憐惜。</p>
<p>現在，坐在高檯上的尊貴者，開始審問了：</p>
<p>「爲什麽？爲什麼？，你說，你爲什麽要逃獄？」</p>
<p>可憐的老囚犯，他祇能顧得顫抖；他底嘴脣雖有些像在微動，但沒有一人能聽得他底答語，當然那法官也不是例外</p>
<p>「你可知道，你現在已估有二條法律的處分；第一條，你犯的是殺人罪；第二條，你又犯了逃獄未遂罪。你可以吿訴我，你對法律的給你的處分，有吾不滿意？」</p>
<p>老囚犯仍是不答，他現在已覺得絕了一切希望，索性連頭也低垂下去。法官似乎也讓這景像感動了，他沒有叱嚇這老囚犯，同叱嚇其他犯罪的人一樣。他祇是靜靜地用慈祥的眼光，給予老囚犯憐惜的注視。大概三分鐘，他轉首向我的朋友張律師說：</p>
<p>『現在指定辯護人可以發表意見了！可憐的老頭兒，他已沒有力量談話了。」</p>
<p>我的朋友很莊重的站了起來。。</p>
<p>「本律師希望庭上能讓被吿回家去一次，此决，被吿之所以企圖逃獄，原是爲着放不下家中一個幼年的外孫，上决會由本律師提起請求，而庭上以案情重大駁回，以致造成此决逃獄的事。所以這决，本律師仍是希望庭上能允被吿返家一次，若有逃亡情事，本律師願負一切責任。至於法律上的處分，本律師並無異議。」</p>
<p>那老囚犯似乎也聽見我朋友的話，他慢慢的抬起頭來，又是乞憐似的眼光，望着上面尊貴的法官，似乎是等待着法官的憐惜。</p>
<p>現在那老囚犯實現了他底希望，他底可憐的經過，也感動了法官，法官已特別允許他返家一次；不過給了他一個期限，是二天。我的朋友也願意幫助他，他給了老囚犯五元錢，另外還代老囚犯僱了一夔烏蓬船，送他上了船，船老大用脚把櫓一推，那船身就劈開了水，飛也似的去了。</p>
<p>我和我的朋友，望着那隻遠去的烏蓬船的遠影，大家都讓一種情感控制着，沒有話，看着那艘船遠去，遠去，直穿進那山後。</p>
<p>「石，你也覺得這老囚犯可憐嗎？」我的朋友掉轉頭對我說；</p>
<p>「是的，眞是可憐極了！」我們都慢慢的走向歸路去：『但是我不相信他會殺人，殺人罪是怎樣一會事啦。』</p>
<p>「唉！』我的朋友先嘆了一口長氣，說：『怎不是呢？誰能相信這老頭子會忍心殺人，這事眞太悲慘了。』</p>
<p>我的朋友頓了頓，繼續說：「起先這老頭兒是個孤老兒，他有一個已嫁的女兒，遭了喪夫的慘事；他底女兒爲了生計，祇得把子女二人，寄在這可憐的老頭兒處，獨自釗上海找活去了。本來這老頭兒，就是靠着乞食度日的；現在，突然的加上二個幼年的外孫，於是就時常鬧着饑餓的事。這樣的，倒也度過了二個月。現在全縣鬧着米荒，一元錢米祇得二升多，有時拿着錢還沒處換米呢？人家那裏還肯把珍珠似的米，施捨窮人。因此，這可憐的老頭兒，同他的二個外孫，時常有好幾天的挨餓。小孩子又不懂事，肚子餓了，就跟外公鬧。逼得老頭兒沒法，在一個淸晨他抱着他底一個外孫</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第七章　「把他押起來」</p>
<p>裏面的光綫不很充足，也瞧不見什麽。我的身子站直的時候，忽聽得地毯上輕微的腳聲，回頭一瞧，有一個女子正從西面走過來。我若無其事地旋轉身子，還回過來，和那女子擦身而過。伊的眼光在瞧房間的號數，分明不注意我。我回頭瞧瞧，見伊走進五五四號裏去。我回到甬道口時，才瞧見七十一號的阿根，正在跟另一個身材短小的茶房密談。阿根也瞧見了我，却並不跟我招呼，祇微微搖了搖頭。我知道道是個趙伯雄不在裹面的暗號。那個身材短小的五十四號茶房，一定就是小李。他也向我瞧了一眼，分明阿根已將我介紹給他了。</p>
<p>我回到樓梯口時，霍桑正從六層樓下來。我也向他搖搖頭。霍桑見左右無人，便低聲向我說話。</p>
<p>一他不在房間裹也好。我想先進去瞧瞧。不過你不必進去，最好找一個適當的地點守候着，萬一他突然回來，我們兩個可以內外接應。</p>
<p>我答應了。霍桑就走到那兩個茶房跟前。阿根見了霍桑，照樣又搖搖頭，隨卽轉身向樓梯口去。霍桑向着那小李附耳說了一句，小李就跟着我們走。霍桑一路瞧　着房間的號數，走到第二個轉折處，他向我弩一弩嘴。我馬上立定，讓小李跟雀桑前進。這地點是到五五六號的必經之路離這轉折處不遠，有一個窗口。我就靠着這窗口站住。我覺得這地點不很方便，如果我站住了不動，人家見了，很容易引起疑心。可是我又不能選擇一個更妥密的地位。</p>
<p>一回兒那小李已回過來，他已給崔桑開了五五六號房間，便獨自退回來。我走到轉折處瞧瞧，霍桑果然已經進去，房門也關上了。可是我再回頭一瞧，遠遠地有一個人從甬道的第一個轉折處搖搖擺擺地過來。道個人距離還遠，我雖瞧不淸楚，但估量他的輪廓，好像就是趙伯雄。（一一六），同投到河裏去自盡。幸而有路人瞧見，把老頭兒救了起來；當初沒人能發覺還有一個小孩子沒救起，直等那老頭兒醒了轉來，嚷着他底外孫，這纔從河中又撈起了個小孩的屍體。就是這樣的，老頭兒犯了殺人罪，被關在牢中。現在他的企圖逃獄，他就是放心不下他家中的另一個外孫；可惜，他又找上了一條逃犯的罪名。唉！眞是慘極了。」</p>
<p>「眞是慘極了！」我深深地被這悲慘的故事感動着，我的朋友也是如此。我們都無語地走着。</p>

<p>我們常常聽見有人引用古代名人聖賢所說過的話來責難別人，來推翻別人的理論而貫澈自已的主張，如果別人稍爲反抗一下，他就大聲咄道：「嘿！這是古人說的呀！」這樣一來，別人也許會無言而退，然而他却並沒有顧慮到古人的這句話是吾還適合於現實，是吾遠背或歪曲了這日向前進的時代所反映的一切，他祗是以爲古人所說的話俱是「至理名言」，決無錯誤，，這種崇拜是盲目的，他忘記了在崇拜以前還須加以一番現代目光的批判。時代是不斷前進的，決無幾千年前古人的思想還可以完全應用在現實的理由。</p>
<h3>無法分身與無法生活</h3>
<p>— 烟帆作</p>
<p>舉個例來說吧：有一位先生凡是看見一個畫寢的人，便搖頭嘆息：「朽木不可雕也。」其理由是從前孔聖人曾經這樣說過，當然凡是畫寢的人都是一些「朽木」和「糞土之牆」了，他沒有知道醫界已經證明短時間的晝寢足可恢復身體上的疲勞，許多身心不絕煩勞的要人都有這一個習慣的。這樣一來，朽木已經不「朽」，牆也不復是「糞土」之流的了。</p>
<p>我們不能盲目地崇拜古人的言行，除非我們已加以檢騐之後。這裏我也需要引用古人一句話，十三世紀培根（Roger　Bacon），說過：「人們不應該盲目地追隨在亞里斯多德之後，而需耍爲他們自己積聚經騐。」另外一位培根（Erancis　Bason），在十七世紀他也說過：「一個人不能因爲以前有人曾說過這件事情對的也跟着說對，而要靠他自己的眼睛去觀察是吾如此。」由此，可知盲目的崇拜已早爲古人所不齒，並非是到了現代才有的「產物」哩！</p>
<p>因出，我們不應該祇是盲目地崇拜古人的言論和思想，而需要加一種新的有力量的批判。把有價値的迎合時代的給保留下來，我們仍舊要去崇拜它，歌頌它，至於一些腐舊的，落伍的，謬誤的思想，我們將毫無懷疑地去拋棄它！朋友，你該知道現在已不復是從前盲目保守的時代了。</p>
<h3>罰金</h3>
<p>— 肅父譯</p>
<p>某决，一個扒掱在行竊的時候被捉住了，警察將他帶到法院去，法官的判決是罰金五十元。</p>
<p>但，警察在扒掱身上一搜，統共祇有三十元，於是警察向法官說：「他不能償付這許多罰金，可以不可以减少爲罰金三十元呢？」</p>
<p>法官這樣回答警察：「那末你仍舊把這扒掱放了吧，放到熱鬧的街道上去，你在後面跟着他，別讓他溜走。過一小時再把他捉進來，五十元的罰金楚不可减少的。」</p>

<h3>男女明星的接吻藝術—銀幕吻話之一—</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>關於銀幕上的接吻，本刊會有過幾篇報導，而在好萊塢的人們看來，拍攝影片的時候，接吻也是一種重要的藝術，本文所要一說的是好萊塢幾個男女大明星接吻的技巧。</p>
<p>（一）男星之部</p>
<p>賈萊古柏和女明星接吻時，在有幾部影片中，好像是瘋在的人一樣。有時他吻接得非常誠懇，能把注意力集中到工作上面，當做一件眞的事情做。</p>
<p>賈克奧開，在好萊塢的男星之中，是吻接得最輕的一個，幾和使女星不覺得在接吻的樣子。</p>
<p>喬治克勞夫和賈克奧開完全相反，他的吻接得最重。有幾個女星不歡喜和他接吻。</p>
<p>威廉鮑惠爾，使每一個好萊塢的女明星知道和他接吻的滋味是怎様的甜蜜。</p>
<p>（二）女星之部</p>
<p>梅蕙絲在銀幕上接吻最是熱情。她在接吻的時候，頭好像放在男性的身上，沒有隙縫沒有轉側，更不會像飛過似的，再沒有缺點可以指出。</p>
<p>琴哈羅接起吻來，祇用嘴脣的一部，非常溫柔。但她的接吻鏡頭，時常要重拍的。</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥接起吻來，頭是動的，自右至左會把她的口紅塗在男性的嘴上。</p>
<p>克勞黛考爾白的吻充滿了賣弄風情的色彩，沒有一定的方式，和她接吻的男星，幾乎會被麻醉。</p>

<h3>Vietnam Accepts Japanese Demands to Conclude Agreement; Japanese Troops Invade Vietnam and Begin Advancing North; France Claims to Grant Military Convenience to Japan to Resolve the War Against China; 200,000 Chinese Troops Concentrated in Yunnan and Guangxi, Preparing to Resist Japanese Invasion</h3>
<p>China's Foreign Ministry Lodges Strong Protest to France</p>
<p>Tokyo – This morning at 11:00 AM, the Japanese Army and Navy Headquarters announced that Japanese army and navy troops began peacefully advancing north through Vietnam today. It is heard that some disputes had occurred in several sections, but it is now believed that they can be resolved immediately. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Vichy – The French government has just issued a public statement saying that all kinds of conveniences have now been granted to the Japanese in terms of naval and land forces in the Vietnam region, so that the Japanese can continue to engage in building a "New Order in East Asia" and resolving the war against China. The statement continued that the Japanese had assured the French government that they would respect France's rights in the Far East, allow the territorial integrity of Vietnam, and the rights of the French in all parts of Vietnam. The French government has now decided to allow the Japanese government all kinds of special conveniences in the Vietnam region, so that Japanese naval and land forces can continue to fight. The French and Japanese military authorities in Hanoi have unanimously agreed on granting various naval conveniences to Japan in order to build a new order in East Asia and resolve the Chinese war. Henry, the French ambassador to Japan, and Matsuoka, the Japanese foreign minister, were in Tokyo last week discussing various fundamental issues in a spirit of friendship. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hanoi – An announcement issued by the French side yesterday afternoon stated that a foundation for "New Friendly Cooperation between Japan and Vietnam in the Far East" had been established. The announcement stated that the "guarantee" given to Vietnam by Japan was exchanged for the French authorities granting Japan certain military conveniences, "no longer imposing restrictions on the Japanese army." French officials indicated that the terms of the agreement signed yesterday had "slightly changed" from the original Japanese demands in last weekend's ultimatum. They recalled that the French side had found some of the original Japanese demands "unacceptable." Reliable sources said that the agreement taking effect included the following key points: (1) Japan can send 6,000 troops to be stationed in Vietnam, and these troops will enter through Haiphong. (2) Japan can use three airfields in Tokyo for military purposes. These airfields include Fuji (transliteration) and Lao Kai or Flandong (transliteration) and the air force base of Kiaram (transliteration). As for the rumored agreement that Japan obtained certain rights on the French railway, nothing was heard last night. Special correspondent, Jacko Pei (transliteration). (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hanoi – Vietnamese authorities and Japanese representatives restarted negotiations on the 21st and continued on the 22nd, immediately signing an agreement whereby Japan provides guarantees to Vietnam, and the Vietnamese authorities granted the Japanese army certain military conveniences, thereby supplementing the principled agreement previously reached between France and Japan in Tokyo, and laying a new foundation for friendly cooperation between Japan and Vietnam in the Far East. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Regarding the matter of Japanese troops requesting to pass through Vietnam, the Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its serious attitude and has called the attention of the Vichy and Vietnamese authorities. According to reliable information, Vietnam signed an agreement with Japanese representatives at 3:00 PM on September 22, allowing Japanese troops to use Vietnamese territory. On the 23rd, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs lodged the most serious protest to the French side. In addition to the free exercise of China's right to self-defense, which Chongqing has repeatedly made clear, it also declared that the French side should be fully responsible for the losses and effects resulting from this. (Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese spokesman commented on France's "agreement with Vietnam," saying that China had ample time to prepare for this outcome and that "our actions will proceed smoothly according to a pre-determined plan." The number of Chinese troops currently concentrated in the two provinces of Yunnan and Guangxi near the Vietnamese border has not been announced, but it is estimated that 200,000 troops are deployed in the Guangxi and Yunnan areas, preparing to resist the Japanese advance on Kunming. He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration, recently flew to the border twice to complete the final preparations. It is generally believed that the Chinese army will not launch an all-out offensive into Vietnam, but it is possible that it will send teams across the border to occupy militarily important positions in the mountains as an outer perimeter of defense. Large-scale destruction of all transportation facilities on the border is currently underway. The entire section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway within Chinese territory has been moved elsewhere. The evacuation of Kunming residents and government agencies is now being stepped up, for fear that Japan may soon launch a fierce bombardment of Kunming from its newly acquired air base in Tokyo. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement tonight reviewing developments in Vietnam and tracing the Chinese government's attitude towards the matter at various stages of the Franco-Japanese negotiations, from the start of the negotiations to Japan's ultimatum to Vietnam. The Chinese people here are not surprised by the news of the Franco-Japanese agreement, because although foreign news repeatedly reported that the Vietnamese authorities had adopted a firm stance and rejected Japanese demands, they always believed that the French side would eventually yield. The most important issue in the minds of the Chinese people at present is what the second step will be after Japan obtains an air base in Vietnam and troops land and pass through the country. It is said that there are only two possibilities: (1) Invade Yunnan Province in an attempt to seize Kunming, China's major southwestern transportation hub. (2) Japan will consolidate its position in Vietnam and wait for an opportunity to subsequently invade the Dutch East Indies and Singapore. According to well-informed Chinese and foreign observers, there are still doubts about whether Japan will attempt to attack Kunming. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Chinese authorities here said this afternoon that the Japanese invasion of Vietnam was merely an indispensable threat adopted by Japan after issuing an ultimatum to the French authorities in Vietnam yesterday. A spokesman said that Japan's recent actions prove that the demand put forward by Japan to pass through Vietnam was merely a pretext to fool the world. "If Japan attacks Vietnam from Chinese territory, why does it need to ask to pass through Vietnam to attack China?" Chinese officials said that they regret that the Vietnamese authorities succumbed and accepted Japan's demands. Although the contents of the Franco-Japanese agreement have not yet been fully published, Chinese officials believe that the scope of the agreement must far exceed the needs of Japanese troops passing through the country. A spokesman said that this agreement will allow Japanese troops to be stationed permanently in Vietnam, and there is no doubt that after this agreement is signed, the first to be sacrificed by Japan's aggression will be Vietnam, not China. Chinese military authorities said that China has made full military preparations on the border. An army spokesman said, "If Japan attacks Yunnan from Vietnam, it will encounter unprecedented failure." However, an official said that third countries with major interests in the Pacific should know that Japan's occupation of Vietnam is a prelude to its attempt to control the entire Southwest Pacific. (International News Service, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – According to French sources here this morning, Japanese troops will begin landing their first batch of troops on Sunday afternoon and evening according to the terms of the new agreement, but the message did not specify the location of the Japanese troops' landing. The details of the agreement signed yesterday afternoon are not yet known, but it is known that the French authorities have allowed some Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam and establish several Japanese airfields. According to the new agreement, it is still unclear whether Japanese troops can use the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The Vietnamese French authorities said that there was a Franco-Japanese conflict last night. (International News Service, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma, when meeting with news reporters today to discuss the Vietnamese Franco-Japanese agreement, declared that Japan has no plans to occupy land in French Indochina. The current Franco-Japanese agreement is based on peaceful talks between the two countries, and no foreign country should have any objection to this. Japan has maintained a patient attitude during the negotiations. Although local conflicts occurred on the border last night, this was entirely due to a misunderstanding by the French authorities in Vietnam. This resolution agreement was initially discussed with the French ambassador to Japan in August of this year, with the aim of resolving the China Incident as soon as possible and contributing to the new order in East Asia. Foreign Minister Matsuoka discussed the fundamental issues concerning Vietnam with the French ambassador in August, and France therefore agreed to grant Japan various military conveniences needed by the army and navy in Vietnam to resolve the China Incident. Later, basic negotiations were conducted in Hanoi, and specific plans were decided with the French military authorities. As a result, a detailed agreement was signed there yesterday afternoon on the 22nd. Japanese troops, in accordance with the agreement, began entering Vietnam from the northern border on the morning of the 23rd. Therefore, the border conflict may have been caused by the French authorities issuing orders to the French troops in the area, and the transmission was delayed. We believe that after this order is transmitted to the French army, the border incident can be quickly resolved. According to the contents of the Franco-Japanese agreement, Tokyo has not yet released it. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Foreign Ministry repeatedly stated today that the Japanese anti-British and American agreement authorizes the United States Navy to use the Singapore base, and its intention is obviously to fear US retaliation for Japan's invasion of Vietnam. According to Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma's statement to reporters today, "We believe that the current situation does not allow such actions. Since the British and American agreement has not taken into account Japanese interests, it is difficult to take effect." Suma also said, "The Hanoi Conference reached an agreement yesterday. According to the terms, the French authorities should allow all Japanese military actions that can be used to resolve the China Incident. The conflict between Japanese and French troops when the Japanese army invaded Vietnam last Sunday night was caused by the French side's failure to immediately notify the local French army of the Hanoi agreement. We have no territorial ambitions for Vietnam, nor do we deliberately incite incidents. What we are hoping for is the peaceful implementation of the Hanoi agreement. Since this agreement was reached through peaceful consultations, other countries should have no objection." However, according to neutral observers here, the establishment of the Hanoi agreement was caused by Japanese threats. The United Kingdom and the United States may take further objections to Japan. The so-called further objection is that the United States accepts the British proposal to use the Singapore naval base. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>The Franco-Japanese Conflict in Đồng Đăng Ceases; Rumor that French Troops Have Been Disarmed</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Japanese Army Headquarters has just stated that the French troops disarmed by the Japanese army are the troops who resisted the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam last night. After the French troops in Đồng Đăng were disarmed, the military actions of the French and Japanese troops on the border have ceased. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Haiphong – The Franco-Japanese sides have signed an agreement, and the war has stopped. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Haiphong – At 10:00 PM last night, the Japanese army in South China invaded Vietnam before the expiration of the 72-hour ultimatum issued on the 20th of this month, encountering strong resistance from the French side, and stopped the attack at midnight, but it is expected that the attack will be re-launched this morning. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Haiphong – Less than 24 hours after the Franco-Japanese agreement was signed in Hanoi yesterday, when Japan's ultimatum was about to expire, Japanese troops suddenly crossed the border from South China today and landed from Japanese warships in Haiphong, and entered Vietnam one after another. Due to a "misunderstanding," French and Japanese troops clashed in Đồng Đăng, a place on the northern border of Vietnam, and fired at each other. Both sides suffered casualties. Several French and Japanese soldiers were killed. It is currently unclear why this conflict occurred. According to French sources, the Japanese advance was large and they did not know that the Western powers had already negotiated an agreement. On the other hand, the Japanese claimed that the Japanese army was only crossing the border in accordance with the terms of the negotiated agreement, and the French army, unaware that an agreement had been signed, "illegally" attempted to resist.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After the Signing of the Vietnam Agreement</h3>
<p>The agreement was signed by Japanese representative Nishihara and French Indochina Governor-General Decoux at 3:00 PM yesterday, the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>Vietnam has long had more than 200 Japanese residents, mostly small businessmen. There were no unresolved disputes between Vietnam and Japan, and it could be called a non-issue. The so-called issue only began after Japan made demands on France, hoping that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway would stop transporting wartime supplies to China. In France's view, concession can achieve complete preservation, compromise can resolve disputes, it is not difficult to dry one's face after being spat on, and accepting requests is not a problem. Great things can be turned into small things, and small things can be turned into nothing, and the problem will disappear. In Japan's view, weakness is an object of aggression, and gaining an inch is a ladder to a foot. Not only do they create something out of nothing, but they can also turn anything they pick up into a problem, and even more so into a grand article. Therefore, after the cessation of transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, there were endless acts of blackmail and fierce appearances, and the agreement was finally concluded yesterday. The terms of the agreement are recorded in today's news column, so there is no need to introduce them here. In France, it is said that "the sincere cooperation between Vietnam and Japan can thereby lay a foundation," and also that "it is reasonable and consistent with the permanent interests of Vietnam to establish friendly relations with sincerity and mutual respect." The person making this statement is Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam, a military man who has always had a reputation for being generous and brave, and Decoux is a general of the French army. In Japan, they agree to recognize "the integrity of Vietnam and France's sovereignty in Vietnam." This statement can be believed by anyone in Japan, and anyone in the world would like to respond with a knowing smile. Here, we do not need to add any interpretation or further expose it. The world should be able to understand whose world Vietnam will be in the future.</p>
<p>Since September 18, 1931, Japan began its various offensives against foreign countries, and it has been more than nine years since then. They have exhausted the full strength of their three armies and the wealth of their officials and people, and they have been fighting hard for more than a year. In terms of legal principles, the only thing that can be called a harvest is this Vietnam agreement. The richness of the harvest is probably no greater than this Vietnam agreement. France was defeated by Germany, a military defeat; and yielded to Italy, a surrender of power. Germany and Italy, using their national and popular fate as a gamble, signed a ceasefire agreement with France; everything else, beyond this, is unknown. Of course, the lords of Vichy may not necessarily be more generous to Japan than to Germany and Italy, and Germany and Italy may not necessarily only engage in taking chestnuts out of the fire to feed Japan. In the end, is what Japan has gained a sweet and plump roasted chestnut that can be safely digested, or a bomb containing a buried fuse? This single Vietnam agreement may not be able to guarantee it for eternity.</p>
<p>There are at least two possibilities for things that are not necessarily so. What will the relationship between France and Germany and Italy ultimately be like? The future is complicated and confusing, so let's put it aside for now. Discussing the Vietnam issue, there are also matters related to Germany and Italy: First, according to speculation from all sides, as well as informal revelations from the Japanese side, it is said that Germany and Italy have actually suppressed France and spoken for Japan in Japan's taking of Vietnam. There are several reasons to believe this statement. However, given the deceitfulness of international relations, while Germany and Italy have never formally expressed anything regarding the Vietnam issue from beginning to end, even if there are reasons to believe it, we should still reserve plenty of room for doubt. The main excuse Japan used to blackmail Vietnam was to obtain military convenience for invading China. Although Germany has given Japan a pleasant appearance in many aspects, it has never sacrificed the good friendship between China and Germany within the scope of Japan's invasion of China, and given Japan any encouragement. Therefore, we are still unwilling to easily believe that Germany has made a clear abandonment of Sino-German friendship for this resolution of Japanese action. At the same time, starting from the friendship between China and Germany, we should also wait quietly for Germany to make a clear statement as proof. Second, assuming that Germany and Italy did indeed support Japan in its coercion of French Indochina, then there must be considerable conditions attached between Germany and Italy and Japan. There is no need to ask about the content of the conditions, but it is a common international practice to forget the means after achieving the goal and to violate faith and betray righteousness. After Japan obtains the Vietnam agreement, will it take actions to fulfill the conditions? Will it be genuine or will it only appear to fulfill them? Will it have the strength to do so? If not, will Japan's gaining of Vietnam by relying on Germany and Italy disappoint Germany and Italy by being deceived and give the Vietnam agreement some kind of impact? These are all possibilities, not necessities.</p>
<p>Opening up the ring of Germany and Italy to discuss the Vietnam agreement, China declared in advance that for the sake of self-defense, China cannot sit idly by and watch France abandon its status as a third country in the Sino-Japanese War, giving China a disadvantage and giving the other side convenience. Although it is impossible to predict what actions China will take after France and Japan sign the agreement and Japanese troops land in Vietnam, it can be asserted that China has the greatest possibility of taking any important action. Only in this way, more due to geographical and historical reasons, and the emotional and interest relations between the French, Vietnamese, and overseas Chinese, can powerful and effective military strategic actions be taken to give the written agreement a factual impact. This is something to pay attention to in the future, first. The United Kingdom has Burma and the Malay Peninsula, the base of the Singapore naval port, which borders Vietnam. Although Japan's plot in Vietnam is said to be against China, it is aimed at the United Kingdom. The gains and losses and the waxing and waning of power in this are the foundations and keys of the British Empire in the East, and the relationship with Hong Kong, a small island, cannot be compared to one ten-thousandth of its importance. As evidence, in the midst of the United Kingdom's busy resistance to Germany, and at a time when it was eager to maintain its only remaining friendship with Japan, it still protested to Japan before the signing of the Vietnam agreement, on the basis of its legally only third-country status. It can be seen that the United Kingdom has been able to confirm that the situation in Vietnam is directly and acutely related to the United Kingdom. Now that the Vietnam agreement has been signed, France has yielded again and again, and Japan's sword is on the brink. Is it said that the United Kingdom will instead be silent and rest? Is it said that the United Kingdom's protest is equal to officialdom, simply doing its best without regard to practical results? Churchill is not Chamberlain, and the two eras are quite different. This is not a minor disease, but the calamity of dismemberment. So what will the United Kingdom do? Even if it does not take any powerful and effective action, but only follows it with high-sounding self-deprecation, how much effort will its wording have to take to become an international wonder? This is something to pay attention to in the future, second. As for the United States, in the two or three months since Vietnam became an issue, it has repeatedly expressed its determination to maintain the status quo, and has never relaxed in the slightest until the eve of the signing of the Vietnam agreement. The reason for this is not only to reveal its sympathy for the weak France, but also because the situation in Vietnam is related to the safety of the Philippines, to the fate of the United Kingdom, and to the future of the Far East and the Pacific, which is both far-reaching and profound. Borrowing the example of Singapore and Hong Kong is undoubtedly an important strategic layout. However, what is the point of just laying out? How can it contain the rampant and mitigate the crisis? The United States has a firm and strong national policy, which we know well. We deeply believe that all its actions have great power and inevitable effects. However, as things stand today, signing the agreement and landing are mocking the United States one by one. There is no question that the United States will definitely take action, and that its actions will definitely affect the Vietnam agreement. The question is how to act? When to act? This is something to pay attention to in the future, third. The world situation is in the midst of a fierce battle between light and darkness, and the development of darkness is wider and faster, and it is getting more and more intense. Since the signing of the Vietnam agreement and the landing of Japanese troops in Vietnam, it has been an important hub for the extension and expansion of the struggle. The Soviet Union is a key player in the overall situation, and all dark forces, no matter what color they are currently dyed or what smoke they are spreading, their nature is ultimately the extreme anti-Soviet camp. Is it said that the Soviet Union will still remain outside the situation and sit idly by and watch it expand? If not, how will it coordinate with the United States and how will it vigorously assist China? The left and right must be supported. How can this be delayed? This is something to pay attention to in the future, fourth. The Vietnam agreement does not add or subtract to the opposing forces of China and Japan. Therefore, Vietnam's being controlled by the Japanese army is by no means another aspect of China being invaded, but rather another nest of disaster in the world. The time for final reckoning has arrived. Is the great light in sight?</p>
<p>Decoux issued a declaration today stating that the Franco-Japanese conclusion of the agreement stipulates the details of what was agreed upon by the Japanese government and the French ambassador in Tokyo. The contents of the agreement were not disclosed in the declaration: (1) To allow the Japanese side to establish three air force bases in Tokyo and have the right to station 5,000 troops to monitor them. (2) The Japanese army has the right to pass through Vietnam from Huainan along a designated route. (3) To allow some Japanese troops to land and station in Haiphong. The first news of the Japanese army invading the border and the French army resisting was published in a French communiqué at midnight, and at the same time, it was said that Nishihara and his entourage had gone to the airfield. It was generally believed that the flames of war would break out from then on. Later, it was learned that the reason why Nishihara and his entourage went to the airfield was only to give the last order to a special envoy, instructing him to fly to the border and deliver it to the commander of the Japanese army. The official French communiqué on the war in Dong Dang only said that the Japanese army crossed the border and the French army resisted with force. As for the details, it is not yet known. It is expected that this matter will soon become clear. It is generally believed that the Vietnamese and Japanese sides will jointly issue a communiqué on this matter today. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Governor of Vietnam Tells People to Acknowledge the Foundation of Franco-Japanese Cooperation Established</h3>
<p>Hanoi – Governor-General of Vietnam, Vice Admiral Decoux, has just issued a letter to the people, roughly saying that difficult negotiations have now come to an end. As the head of Vietnam, I should give an objective explanation of the current situation and call on the people to maintain calm, abide by discipline, and uphold a spirit of understanding. The governments of France and Japan have formed a diplomatic agreement stipulating that Japan clearly recognizes Vietnam's territorial integrity and France's central rights in Vietnam. In France, it is out of a spirit of friendly assistance to give the Japanese army certain military conveniences in Vietnam as an exchange condition. Later, the Vietnamese authorities began talks with Japanese representatives to formulate implementation methods for the above agreement. The talks have been going on for several weeks. The Vietnamese commander-in-chief and Commander Martin of the Vietnamese garrison have carefully reviewed the implementation conditions, taking great pains to ensure that they are beneficial to both parties and can truly be regarded as the initial expression of lasting friendship between France and Japan. Based on this purpose, in the northern region, there will be several airfields for the Japanese army to use to meet the needs of its military operations. No greater confidence can be shown by one country to another. The sincere cooperation between Vietnam and Japan can thereby lay a foundation. Our Vietnam and the Japanese Empire are close at hand. It is reasonable and consistent with the permanent interests of Vietnam to establish friendly relations with sincerity and mutual respect. The agreement signed by both parties recently is intended to adapt to this pragmatic policy, and the Vietnamese people will definitely understand its purpose, which I firmly believe. I have fully fulfilled my duties as the head of Vietnam, and I hope that the people can also do their best, accept the new situation without any other intentions, so that the new situation can enable Vietnam to work in peace and thereby move forward on the path of destiny. For the present, French and Vietnamese should unite under the guidance of their leaders with the spirit of discipline, work, and patriotism. This is the urgent task that cannot be delayed.

<h3>U.S. Declines to Comment Before Receiving Official Report</h3>
<p>Vichy, French officials declared here last night that a Franco-Japanese agreement regarding Vietnam had been established. The statement was made before receiving news that Japanese troops had crossed the Annam border last night. Recently, French newspapers here published lengthy commentaries on the statement made by U.S. Secretary of State Hull regarding Vietnam. The French newspapers analyzed that the U.S. had not provided concrete assistance to Vietnam, and therefore France might be forced to accept Japan's demands. The Petit Parisien reported that some American telegrams indicated that the U.S. would oppose Japanese troops landing in Vietnam, but such statements were not officially verified. Washington's insistence that Japan respect the status quo in Vietnam is, of course, a given. However, one might ask whether this attitude can translate into concrete action. Given the current state of U.S. military expansion, this is still doubtful. Moral protests are insufficient to deter the dynamism of Japan's new Konoe cabinet. Therefore, we can only rely on our own strength and negotiation to escape this dangerous situation with minimal losses. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington, the news of Japanese troops entering Annam, published in newspapers this morning, has caused great unease in Washington. The White House has not yet received an official report confirming the news, and therefore has not issued any opinions. However, the general opinion in Washington is that the U.S. is now facing a situation that requires decisive action. Given the U.S.'s publicly stated policy of maintaining the status quo in the Far East, it is believed here that the U.S. will not tolerate the existence of this new situation. Whether the U.S. government's reaction to this matter will be limited to lodging a protest with Japan, or whether it will take more severe measures, depends on President Roosevelt's decision. Sources close to the State Department claimed that since the outbreak of the war, the U.S. has considered the Annam issue to be an extremely serious problem in the Far East. To uphold the U.S.'s commitment to maintaining the status quo in the Far East, it has been decided to station the U.S. fleet in Honolulu. (Haitong News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo, today's news: U.S. Ambassador Grew visited Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka on Saturday for a 90-minute meeting. The topic of discussion is unknown. The U.S. Ambassador and Matsuoka also held a meeting on Friday evening. Political circles believe that the main topic of conversation must have been the situation in Vietnam. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington, the State Department today refused to criticize the Franco-Japanese agreement allowing Japanese troops to enter Vietnam. According to the State Department, it does not intend to comment before receiving official reports regarding the situation in Vietnam. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Authority Spokesman Will Support Japanese Occupation of Vietnam</h3>
<p>Rome, a responsible official of the Fascist Party recently stated that the Italian government may support the Japanese occupation of Vietnam. An authoritative spokesperson stated that, given the friendly relations between Italy and Japan, Italy will support Japan's actions in Vietnam's situation. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, knowledgeable sources here revealed that Germany and Japan had reached a compromise on the Vietnam issue at some point in the past. Therefore, Japan's attitude in recent negotiations has been tough, culminating yesterday. It was also stated that Germany agreed to Japan sending troops to a limited area within Vietnam, provided that Japan guarantees no intention of occupying Vietnam. Germany does not object to Japan obtaining concessions for rice, salt, coal, and other minerals. (United Press, 23rd)</p>

<h3>German Air Force Continues to Attack London Area, Uses "New Weapons" Extensively, Sulfur Bombs Shine Brightly, Anti-Aircraft Fire Unprecedentedly Intense</h3>
<p>London, as British searchlights and anti-aircraft batteries fully cooperated according to new defense methods last night and this morning, the activities of German raiders became tense again. Bombs were scattered throughout London, and a mysterious sulfurous yellow light was used, which the British call "new German weapons." Violent anti-aircraft fire and bomb explosions were heard throughout the area. Bombings and gunfire were particularly intense in the southwest and northwest. The first wave of air raids occurred in the darkness. However, as German planes appeared and disappeared in the clouds, performing a game of hide-and-seek, the searchlights were also unusually active. Continuous anti-aircraft fire formed a shimmering light in the sky. German planes, either individually or in groups of two or three, circled over London, occasionally hiding in the clouds to avoid anti-aircraft fire, but the anti-aircraft guns continued to fire at them. The searchlights closely followed the groups of German planes, and the anti-aircraft fire was frantically directed at the illuminated sky. Fires were started in the southwest district due to bombings, but the fires were soon brought under control. Countless houses and shops were destroyed in the northwest area. A house with many residents was also damaged when a bomb landed near a building, but no one was injured as the residents had taken refuge in air-raid shelters. The first air-raid alert was lifted earlier than usual, but the residents of London remained in their basements, not being fooled. A second air raid occurred immediately. Only a few minutes after the alert was issued, bombs and gunfire were active in central London. Three bombs landed in London, one of which caused a gas pipe to rupture and ignite, creating an explosion that sounded like an express train passing through a tunnel. This was followed by bombing by a few planes until dawn. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>London, yesterday, the English Channel was hit by storms and rain. The British coastal defense forces were able to rest a little because there was less German aircraft activity. However, the German long-range artillery continued to shell the British Isles across the sea all day in the rain. The shells all landed in the southeast. It is reported that German aircraft also visited the area. London's artillery fired continuously last night. Many German planes failed to break through the fire net and were forced to flee before reaching their targets. The German planes that attacked at night came rolling in from the northwest after being driven back for two consecutive days. (International, 23rd)</p>
<p>London, German air force bombing of London intensified today. Within the first hour and a half of the initial air raid, the intensity was not very severe, but it became more intense later. After midnight, anti-aircraft batteries throughout the London area opened fire, launching a major counterattack against German planes. According to the semi-official News Association last night, the Germans "seem to be using a secret weapon." The association stated, "For several consecutive times, a yellow sulfurous light illuminated the sky for up to two seconds. This light lasted longer than the flash of a bomb explosion, but was not as long-lasting as a real flame." German bombers flew in groups of three, four, five, or six all over the London area, presumably to avoid the powerful anti-aircraft fire. German planes dropped "Molotov bread baskets" in several places in the city. The intensity of London's anti-aircraft fire later became like throwing a real steel curtain into the sky. During the second air raid alert in London yesterday, there was a fierce battle over the northern suburbs. During the first air raid yesterday afternoon, four bombs hit southeast London. On Saturday night, a hospital in central London was hit. The bomb went through the roof of the church, but no one was injured. In addition, other villages in southeastern England were also attacked, but the damage was minimal. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>London, last night, German planes flew to London and dropped bombs on the southeast area, killing and injuring seven people. Many houses and shops were damaged. The bombs dropped by the German planes mostly landed in areas that had already been attacked and damaged. Also, a German plane flew to northwest London, broke through the dense clouds, and dived to drop a batch of high-explosive bombs, destroying several houses and shops. The enemy planes that attacked last night seemed to be hiding above the clouds. The anti-aircraft guns bombed the clouds, and the enemy planes dispersed and fled. The artillery fire continued to bombard them. The Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Home Security issued a public statement on the activities of the German air force yesterday, stating that the German side did not have large-scale activities. There were occasional single planes flying over the eastern and northeastern coasts. Some intruded into the mainland over East Anglia, and a few reached the London countryside and southeastern London. Bombs were dropped, hitting several houses, and gas and water pipes were slightly damaged. It is heard that there were slight casualties. It is heard that two churches were slightly damaged and a hospital was also damaged. However, none of the people and patients in the hospital were injured. It is reported that at least twenty small fires broke out in northwest London, but they were extinguished before they spread. It is heard that a total of four German planes were lost yesterday, falling into the sea near Gottawyn Sands in North Wales, the Sussex coast and London. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Planes Bomb Berlin, German Channel Base Continues to Be Bombed</h3>
<p>Berlin, tonight Berlin encountered the first British air raid in a week. People in Berlin rushed to air-raid shelters. The air raid alert lasted for two and a half hours. German heavy anti-aircraft fire prevented British planes from flying into the center of Berlin. A German communiqué stated that three British bomber formations had penetrated northern Germany via the Netherlands. It is claimed that several British planes reached Brandenburg, where they encountered the outer perimeter of the Berlin defense line. German official sources also stated that the British planes fled without dropping bombs. (International, 23rd)</p>
<p>London, at the end of the week, the British Air Force resumed its terrible bombing of the Channel ports, namely, Hitler's base for the invasion of England, causing significant damage to ships, docks, and ports. According to an Aviation Ministry statement, from dusk on Saturday to nearly dawn on Sunday, the ports of Ostend, Dunkirk, Boulogne, and Calais were heavily bombed by British bombers. Many ships and docks were hit by bombs, exploding and catching fire. All the British planes returned safely. Prior to this operation, British planes had targeted the defenses of the Flushing port and ships in the canals between Rotterdam, Antwerp, Ostend, and Calais to Saint-Omer. British coastal aircraft also attacked German ships at sea and were quite successful. Near Boulogne, a convoy of 12 merchant ships was bombed, and south of Bergen, a large supply ship was bombed with incendiary bombs by a patrolling British plane. British planes also attacked two smaller ships near the Dutch island of Ameland, one of which was hit and exploded. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin, three squadrons of British fighters entered northern Germany via the Netherlands last night and circled through the Berlin air defense zone but were driven back without dropping a single bomb by the German air defenses. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin, according to the German High Command, a German naval speedboat sank an armed merchant ship of 3,000 tons and destroyed a British patrol boat near the British coast yesterday. German planes conducted reconnaissance over Britain yesterday and bombed military targets in London and southern England.

There was no damage to Berlin, and the British planes suffered no losses, but one German plane went missing. Major Molders' fighter squadron has defeated enemy planes in more than 500 engagements. Lieutenant Russ's submarine sank four enemy merchant ships (29,000 tons). (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>German Air Force's Statistics on Air Raids Against Britain: 200 Attacks on Commercial Ports, 8 Million Kilograms of Bombs Dropped</h3>
<p>Berlin, according to inquiries made by this agency to responsible authorities in Berlin this morning, since August 10th, the German Air Force has dropped a total of 23 million kilograms of bombs of various sizes on military targets in Britain. During the last six weeks of intensified air raids against Britain, a total of 200 attacks were launched on major commercial ports in Britain, and a total of 8 million kilograms of explosives were dropped. During the same period, 700 attacks were launched on central and southern England and London, and a total of 15 million kilograms of bombs were dropped. A total of 6,000 factories were damaged, including 1,400 in London. 20% of all or parts of waterworks and power plants in major British cities were destroyed. Hundreds of kilometers of the most important transportation centers and railways were destroyed. Four stations in London were destroyed, and three subway lines were collapsed. Food warehouses and cotton mills in various cities were destroyed, valued at 1.5 billion marks. These statistics are based on reports and photographs from German aircraft pilots, as well as pre-war British statistics on the goods handled by various cities. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Circumstances of the British Children's Ship Disaster: 90 Children, Only 7 Escaped</h3>
<p>London, today the first news was disclosed that on the 17th of this month, a German submarine in the Atlantic torpedoed a British children's evacuation ship. The number of deaths may be no less than 294. Of the 90 children on board, 83 also died. These children boarded the ship at a port on the west coast in the second week of this month to reside temporarily in Canada. The ship was hit by a torpedo at 10:00 PM on the 17th. Seven of the nine escorts also died. Seven surviving children have been taken to a port in northern England by a warship. It was found that the ship had very comprehensive precautions. Every 15 evacuated children had experienced escorts, doctors and nurses each to take care of. However, the situation when the tragedy occurred made all kinds of precautions fail. When the torpedo exploded, several children were killed. In addition, the treacherous sea waves overturned many lifeboats, making rescue impossible. When the warship carrying the endangered children sailed back, the governor of the autonomous territory, Salisbury, greeted them and said, "It is shocking and infuriating that a German submarine torpedoed a ship 600 miles from land in a treacherous sea. Under the circumstances at the time, passengers on board, whether adults or children, had little chance of escaping. This action by the German side will surely shock the world. This is another example of Germany's barbaric methods of warfare, consistent with the barbaric bombing of women and children in London today." (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London, according to a male passenger on the British children's ship sunk by a German submarine, there was no warning before the German submarine attacked. The ship was hit by a torpedo, pierced through and capsized quite severely, sinking almost immediately, leaving only 20 minutes to unload the lifeboats. In addition, the darkness at sea increased the difficulty, and the turbulent waves almost swept us away. Then came rain and hail. The children behaved very calmly and obeyed orders. Two children died on the warship. Sonia, 11, and her 9-year-old brother, Terry, were among those rescued. Sonia said, "After we got on deck, we were ordered to go to the bow and enter the lifeboat. My sister had already gone down the ladder. My brother went down the rope. By the time he reached the sea, the boat had already rowed away, so he went back up. My brothers and I were then ordered to go to the stern. As we were running on the deck, we learned that the ship was sinking. We ran back to the bow and climbed down the rope into a small boat. Just as we were about to sit down, it was overturned by the wind and fell into the sea, and was picked up by another boat. Later, a warship was seen sailing over, and we cheered. Then we boarded the ship. Thank God for protecting us. My sister was already there. The sailors gave us wine, which was hard to drink, but because I drank it was beneficial, I swallowed it all at once." (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington, American people are very indignant at the news of the sinking of the British children's evacuation ship. Some members of Congress considered the matter to be "violence" and called Hitler "a mad butcher." All aspects of New York loathed Hitler's actions and expressed sympathy for the victims. According to news reports, the children were as calm as adults when the ship was sinking, and some sang songs and comforted the dying in the lifeboat. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Ottawa, the brutal tactics of Germany sinking a ship full of British children in a storm-ridden ocean has caused great anger throughout Canada, and it is believed that this crime has solemnly demonstrated the conflict between the British Empire and Hitler's concepts. Senator Wilson, who most strongly advocated for British children to come to Canada, recently told a Reuters reporter that this matter made our determination to move children to a safe place even more firm.

<h3>Egyptian Front, Italian Troops Advance Densely, Suffered Heavy Losses Due to British Artillery Fire, Italian Side Claims to Have Sunk a British Ship</h3>
<p>Cairo, military news received here, Italian troops on the Egyptian front are adopting German tactics, advancing densely, rolling like waves, regardless of casualties, resulting in heavy casualties. At the same time, its transportation chain is long, making it more difficult to maintain the large army on the front line. However, the British army does not underestimate the combat effectiveness of the Italian army. When the Italian army advances in a dense formation, although it is a fixed target for British artillery fire, it fights bravely and shows no signs of shrinking. It is heard that the Italian army suffered heavy casualties when entering the village of Sidi Barrani, because the British army densely laid landmines in the village. When the Italian army invaded, it activated the control button, causing the landmines to explode. According to eyewitnesses, the landmines exploded after the enemy army entered the village, and the entire village was blown to pieces. The accuracy of the British artillery and its equipment and firing has proven to be superior to the Italian army. Now the British army is spirited and awaits the decisive battle, allowing the Italian army to slowly advance far behind the British army. At the same time, the British armored units are familiar with the terrain occupied by the Italian army, and use this point to bombard the Italian army and cause them trouble. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Cairo, at the end of the week, Haifa was again attacked by Italian aircraft, which dropped bombs everywhere, killing 32 people and injuring 68 people, all of whom were Arabs. Several houses were damaged. A mosque and a Muslim cemetery were also among the damaged. All believed that the anti-aircraft fire had hit at least two Italian aircraft. Alexandria was also bombed, but the material damage was negligible and the casualties were very slight. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Haifa, when Italian planes recently raided here, a large number of leaflets and bombs fell at the same time, declaring Mussolini's love for the Arab people. A total of 32 people were killed and 68 injured in this battle, all of whom were Arabs. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome, the Italian Supreme Command announced today that the British air force in Egypt is now very panicked. Italian bombers are carrying out high-altitude bombings on British military targets without encountering any resistance. The Italian High Command announced tonight that the Italian aircraft attacked Mersa Matruh very successfully. As a result of the bombing there, a large fire has broken out. The British anti-aircraft guns fired at our planes with no effect, and the British air force was not seen to rise up to resist, but the Italian side admitted that the Italian concentration points in Sidi Barrani and Tobruk were bombed by British planes. (International, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome, according to the Italian High Command, the British cruiser sunk on the 17th after being hit by a torpedo. Haifa was heavily damaged by Italian aircraft bombing on the 21st, and large fires broke out everywhere. The Micabba airfield in Malta was bombed again, and nearby barracks were hit and caught fire. British destroyers avoided combat, and all Italian planes returned safely. British aircraft bombed Benghazi, destroying several houses, fortunately without any casualties. British aircraft attacked Bardia without any losses. A British four-engine plane was shot down into the sea by Italian destroyers using machine guns off the coast of Cyrenaica. All the pilots drowned. Italian aircraft attacked British motorized units and bombed military targets in Matruh, which was quite successful. There were no losses for the Italian aircraft. Italian aircraft bombed the port of Aden last night, and three ships in the British convoy in the Red Sea were also bombed by Italian aircraft. British aircraft bombed two natives and injured two natives near Grah Sala and Asmara, with little damage. A British submarine sank an Italian airship in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea.

<h3>Egypt Declares National Martial Law, Four Cabinet Members Resign, Italian Side Regards It as Good Fortune</h3>
<p>Cairo, Egyptian Prime Minister Pasha recently announced national martial law. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome, the Cairo government announced that four pro-British and pro-war cabinet members in the Egyptian cabinet have resigned and will be replaced by politicians who support a "wait-and-see" policy. Authoritative sources here believe that this move by Egypt is extremely beneficial to Italy, because after the resignation of the four, most of the remaining Egyptian cabinet members are unwilling to wage war on Italy. It is generally believed that Egypt's foreign policy is now in a very delicate and extremely critical state. General Graziani's planned desert blitz to North Africa will depend on Egypt's decision. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Military Expert Discusses the Anglo-German War, Germany Accelerates Fierce Attacks, Britain Extends Decisive Battle</h3>
<p>Moscow, Colonel Shevchenko recently published an article in Pravda entitled "The Battle for the English Channel," which stated, "The German air force is still on the offensive. On the other hand, Britain's only defensive force, the navy, has begun to move. From this point of view, both sides are preparing for a decisive battle. According to the large number of air forces and powerful navies fighting, there is no precedent in history. Therefore, future developments are extremely noteworthy. We believe that the future Anglo-German air and sea war will determine the fate of the German offensive on the English Channel. Germany is now working to accelerate the offensive. On the other hand, the British command is trying to consume the strength of the German air force, while at the same time purchasing a large number of aircraft in the United States to enhance its own air force. In short, the British side is doing its best to postpone the decisive battle." (TASS, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Air Defense Cannot Be Slackened, Observations of British Experts</h3>
<p>London, British aviation expert Stewart said today in a broadcast that the Germans are looking for weaknesses in air defenses, and once they find them, they will take advantage of the situation to break through with all their strength. Germany used this method on France before, and today it is planning to use old tricks against England again. Therefore, the British must always be vigilant and not be slack, and the strength of the air force must be fully maintained. This is the best answer to the British offensive. Britain must continue to build more and better aircraft and expand its sky power. As such, Germany will never be able to invade Britain. This decisive battle is decided in the sky. We should build more aircraft on a large scale. In the past, we often had speculative words about the German air force's superiority and the number of aircraft on both sides. Now there must be no question of the number of aircraft that we should have, because the answer is not the number of aircraft that the enemy has, but our ability to produce aircraft. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Italians Enter Syria</h3>
<p>Istanbul, the increasing number of Italian mission members in Syria has already attracted close attention. Recently, another group of nine Italians arrived in Syria and went to Beirut to join the Armistice Commission. People here are paying more close attention to it, because it is rumored here that Italy has malicious intentions towards Syria. According to travelers who arrived here from Iraq via Syria, Italian activities are very cautious for fear of Syrian people, and even all Arabs, revolting. It is heard that the hatred of Arabs for Italians is now intensifying. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Factory Steps Up Production</h3>
<p>London – Minister of Aircraft Production Beaverbrook recently urged aircraft workers to increase production, saying that aircraft production must be greatly increased next week, as the testing time is fast approaching. The aircraft factory is responsible for supplying all the aircraft needed by frontline combat personnel. Men and women throughout the country engaged in the aircraft manufacturing industry have all agreed to meet the needs of the British Air Force. This assurance has been earnestly fulfilled in the past, and in the future, the expectations of aircraft pilots should not be disappointed. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Daladier Awaits Trial</h3>
<p>Vichy – Former Prime Minister Daladier, after being arrested, was transferred today from the Château de Chazeron to the town of Lyon, to await the summons of the Supreme Court for trial. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Fundamental Reform of French Agricultural Production System</h3>
<p>Vichy – Minister of Agriculture Caziot recently issued an order to fundamentally reform the French agricultural production system, with provisions for the organization of farms and the distribution of agricultural products. The main points are two: (1) Restore certain types of production enterprises, such as sheep raising, and develop and innovate the planting of textile raw materials such as cotton and hemp, to adapt to modern needs and the new economic structure of post-war France. (2) Although French farmers must abandon excessive individualism, their position in society should be elevated, so that under the guidance of the government, they can cooperate fully. People in the agricultural sector have welcomed this order, saying that the French agricultural production system is outdated, and in fact, except for the production of wheat, sugar beets, and grapes, there is general disorder, which urgently needs to be reformed. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Construction Begins in Northern French Industrial Zone</h3>
<p>Lille – Under the cooperation of the German authorities and French officials, a plan has now been drawn up to construct the northern French industrial zone of Lille, Roubaix, and Tourcoing. The implementation of this plan will reduce a large number of unemployed people. The defensive obstacles around the city of Lille will be removed, laid with grassland, and converted into sports fields. The citadel will not be demolished. The entire project will be completed by next spring. In addition, the houses in the city of Lille that were destroyed by the war will be rebuilt, and the canal network around the city of Lille will be improved to promote navigation. The traffic situation near the city of Lille is also planned to be improved. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Submarine Sinks Spanish Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>Gibraltar – The naval authorities here recently announced that an Italian submarine fired a torpedo and sank the Spanish fishing boat "Calancha." This incident occurred last Thursday morning off Cape Villano in northwestern Spain. All crew members were killed except one survivor who, upon landing in Corunna, said that the submarine that fired the torpedo seemed to be Italian. The crew even threw Italian cigarettes into the small net that was being hauled. Some believe that the "Calancha" was mistaken for a British patrol boat. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Reorganization of French Colonial Administration</h3>
<p>Vichy – The French government today ordered the reorganization of the Colonial Supervision Office. All supervisors and general supervisors have been changed to administrative officials, retaining the same powers. The retirement age for general supervisors is set at sixty, and the retirement age for supervisors is set at fifty-six. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Vichy – Regarding General de Gaulle and the British incitement of a revolutionary movement in French colonies against the Vichy government, the extent of its spread, according to Haitong News Agency's inquiry to the French government last night, is as follows: The center of the resistance movement is in French Equatorial Africa, including Ubangi-Chari, with a population of 3.6 million, but only a few hundred white people. The colony of Cameroon, with a population of 2.5 million, is also said to have accepted de Gaulle's orders. The attitude of the people of Togo is wavering, but some of the ruling French are sympathetic to General de Gaulle. The situation in New Caledonia is the same. The governor, Denis, was opposed by the people and fled. From this, it can be seen that those who sympathize with de Gaulle rule over 7 million black people. Only Morocco, Tunisia, West Africa, Algiers, and other places support the Pétain government, with a total population of 30 million. However, the attitude of the people is only a matter of decision. The most important thing is the ruling authorities. As for the final attitude, it depends on the development of the attack on England. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Earplugs Distributed Throughout Britain</h3>
<p>London – Tens of millions of "earplugs" will be distributed free of charge to the people of the country by local authorities. This measure will begin to be implemented soon. It is said that these "earplugs" will not only protect the eardrums but also reduce the noise during air raids, making it easier to fall asleep. (Reuters, 33rd)</p>
<h3>British Authorities Investigate Soldiers' Relatives</h3>
<p>London – The British Army, Navy, and Air Force recently announced a plan whereby relatives of soldiers, such as parents and wives, can carry a piece of paper stating the soldier's name and other details, so that in the event of casualties due to air raids, the authorities can notify the soldiers serving in the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

<h3>German Air Force's Meticulous Transportation Network</h3>
<p>Berlin – German officials told Haitong News Agency last night, announcing Germany's control of the air warfare transportation network and signaling operations, claiming that there is a vast means of transportation between naval bases, coastal batteries, and German Air Force signal stations. Along the 1,000-kilometer coastline from Brest to Calais, all airfields, air force ports, and air force headquarters are densely connected by telegram networks. Once the air force is dispatched, all base signal stations and air force headquarters maintain wireless networks. Even though air force personnel are thousands of kilometers away, they can always know all important news and the latest developments. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Britain Agrees in Principle to Transfer of American Ships to Singapore to Defend Malaya, Burma, Australia, and Dutch East Indies; American Aircraft May Remain in Hong Kong to Restrain Japan</h3>
<p>Washington – According to sources in Japanese diplomatic circles, Britain and the United States have in principle agreed that the United States Far East Fleet may be stationed in Singapore when the situation permits. It is expected that the recent several talks between US Secretary of State Hull, British Ambassador Lothian, and Australian Minister Casey have largely concluded this matter. Hull told a new reporter last week that the Singapore issue had been discussed, but he did not think formal negotiations had begun or that any decisions had been made. Diplomatic circles pointed out that several weeks ago, British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander declared that Britain was willing to allow the United States to borrow Singapore so that ships of the US fleet could have the convenience of repairs and mooring when necessary. Therefore, the negotiations were considered unnecessary to prolong. It is believed that whether the US fleet's move from Hawaii to Singapore can truly become a reality depends on the following three essential elements: (1) Japan dispatches troops to Vietnam regardless of US warnings; (2) the request of Admiral Richardson, commander of the Pacific Fleet, who is said to have left Hawaii for home today; (3) the British fleet must both fight the German air force to resist invasion and control the Atlantic and Mediterranean. It is not yet known what Admiral Richardson's views are on the current emergency situation in the Pacific. Experts in international law say that the fleet of a neutral country can be stationed at the base of a belligerent country and still be regarded as the fleet of a neutral country. This is a debatable point. (International, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington – Experts in the Navy Department and the State Department stated today that establishing a US naval base in Singapore would not only defend the Malay Peninsula, Burma, and Australia, but also protect the United States' sources of tin and rubber in the Dutch East Indies. They also said that this move would free the British Navy from worries about the East and enable it to concentrate on defending its Atlantic bastion to resist Germany's challenge to the Monroe Doctrine. However, people here expressed considerable doubt as to whether Japan would protest against the United States using Singapore as a base, since Britain is not currently at war with Japan. (International, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong – The fact that Hong Kong will be included in the scope of British-American naval cooperation has aroused general speculation here. The Japanese side is quite silent about this. Qualified observers here believe that if the United States uses Singapore as a base for operations in the Pacific, then, in view of the convenience of Hong Kong for repairing, unloading, and providing military supplies to the navy, Hong Kong will also be included. As a naval base, Hong Kong can be used as an important fortress for Singapore. However, from another perspective, Hong Kong is too close to Shantou and Guangzhou, which have been occupied by Japan. If the United States goes to war with Japan, then the island of Hong Kong will also be useless. However, if Britain and the United States can cooperate in the Pacific, then Hong Kong can be defended and used as a British air base. Observers here all agree that if the United States and Japan do not go to war, the presence of American aircraft in Hong Kong will have a certain restraining force on Japan. (International, 23rd)</p>
<h3>US Asiatic Fleet Departs from Qingdao</h3>
<p>Qingdao – The last of the ships of the US Asiatic Fleet, which had been in Qingdao for nearly three months, departed for other destinations after midnight yesterday. These included the flagship USS Augusta, the cruiser USS Marblehead, the flagship USS Isabel, and a destroyer. The destination is unknown, but it is likely to be Shanghai. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Indian Navy Strengthens Its Forces</h3>
<p>London – The Admiralty announced today that the navy defending Indian territorial waters has become increasingly powerful since it was expanded last year. The commander is General Fitzherbert, whose term has been extended. Officials also said that India is now working hard to build ships, and Australian shipyards are also building larger naval defense ships to help expand the Indian Navy. Several new-style warships will also be sailing from Britain soon. It is also reported that since Italy's entry into the war, the personnel of the Royal Indian Navy have increased by 200 percent since September 1939, and are still expanding. (United Press, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Chinese Consul-General to the Philippines Broadcasts to the United States, Suggests British-American Alliance to Jointly Prevent Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>Manila – Yang Guang-sheng, the Chinese Consul-General here, gave a radio broadcast to the United States tonight, suggesting that Britain and the United States should form a united front in the Far East to prevent Japanese aggression. Mr. Yang briefly stated, "Unless Britain and the United States are united, we will be divided. The failure of some European countries is due to their inability to cooperate. Therefore, the democratic countries in the Far East must not ignore this again. However, it seems difficult to determine who will be the leader. In short, we should support those who are powerful and determined to fight to the end." Mr. Yang, knowing that the United States is more concerned about the war in Europe, specifically warned, "The United States' assistance to democratic countries, if divided between Europe and Asia, is a fallacy. At this time, even though the United States' power has not been drawn into the whirlpool of war, if it continues to isolate itself and does not take active action, then the massacres and destruction that are now taking place in Europe and Asia will inevitably befall the United States."

<h3>Philippine Customs Seizes Opium Paste Worth Over Ten Thousand Philippine Pesos</h3>
<p>Manila – Five hundred boxes of opium paste, each box weighing one tael, were seized in the Chinese baggage room of the customs here, worth a total of 12,500 Philippine pesos. This contraband was hidden in a leather suitcase. It was found that this suitcase was brought here by a traveler from China on a Dutch Madada ship whose name is not known. Customs detectives waited for three days but did not find the owner of the goods. Therefore, no one has been arrested so far. It is believed that the opium paste came from Hong Kong.

<h3>After Returning Home, German Foreign Minister to Meet Spanish Interior Minister; Whether Suner Will Visit Italy is Undecided; New African Order Belongs to Italy</h3>
<p>Berlin – After the conclusion of the Rome talks, well-informed sources here commented that the Axis powers often implement resolutions with actions. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's visit to Rome will be remembered forever throughout the world. The third meeting between the Italian Prime Minister and the German Foreign Minister discussed important political issues. Ribbentrop's four-day visit to Rome has opened up a new situation in the war against England. It is expected that the important diplomatic and political issues discussed in principle at this meeting will promote further diplomatic action. For example, after Foreign Minister Ribbentrop returns home, he will meet again with Spanish Interior Minister Suner. It will be possible to decide whether Suner will visit Rome at that time. The communiqué issued by Spain, expressing its close relationship with the Axis powers, is regarded by people here as a major political factor. As for the extent to which Spain will participate in activities in Europe and Africa, it will be decided by Spain itself. People in Berlin believe that Spain will not stand idly by in the war against its historical enemy, England. Spain's interests in this war, and the attitude of Spanish newspapers in recent days, have clearly stated that a new Spain will actively participate in building a new European order. Political figures in Berlin hinted that this Rome meeting not only discussed important political issues but also discussed the measures to be taken after the victory. After achieving victory, the Axis powers should move forward synchronously and understand each other's goals. Rome and Berlin are in complete agreement on this matter. Regarding the new African order, Rome and Berlin both believe that it should belong to Italy. Germany only seeks colonies. This is an important post-war issue discussed at the Rome meeting. Berlin solemnly pointed out that building a new Europe requires changing the situation in Africa. This point was also agreed upon at the Rome meeting. In addition, the issues discussed should be the Balkan issue, which is extremely important to Italy. Germany's interests in the Danube region have been adjusted by the Vienna Arbitration, so there are no unresolved issues left to be discussed. Italian newspapers have repeatedly discussed the Balkan issues related to Yugoslavia and Greece. At this Rome meeting, Rome and Berlin should have reached an understanding. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin – Spanish Interior Minister Suner will return here from the Western Front today. After arriving in Brussels, Mr. Suner will take a special train to Berlin. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin – "Essener National-Zeitung," the mouthpiece of German Aviation Minister Goering, commented this morning on the Vienna meeting, saying that new developments are expected in the situation on all sides within a few days after the meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other politicians and this Axis powers Rome meeting. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's departure from Rome only superficially declared the end of the meeting. In terms of the important issues discussed at this meeting, they will become increasingly important in the future. The newspaper then discussed the German-Italian alliance signed by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano in Milan in May of last year, saying that military offensives cannot be announced to the enemy in advance. The resolutions of this Rome meeting cannot be made public until they are mature. Even in the case of the German-Italian alliance signed last year, its contents were only announced some time after the signing. (Haitong, 23rd)</p>
<p>France – "Le Temps" of Clermont-Ferrand commented on German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's trip to Rome, saying that Ribbentrop's trip to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano, in addition to discussing the German large-scale offensive against the British Empire and the position of Spain in the current European war, the Balkan Peninsula issue must also be of great importance. From the observation of various phenomena, the situation in that area is extremely chaotic. If the Green-German-Italian Axis powers want to establish a solid foundation for the new European order, then the resolution of various outstanding issues among Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Greece is a prerequisite. The resolution of these outstanding issues is more difficult than the cession of Dobruja to Bulgaria by Romania. As for Bulgaria's request that Greece cede Thrace, the Soviet Union supports Bulgaria's request, while Turkey encourages Greece to resist. Germany and Italy cannot ignore this situation. In addition, the Soviet Union's intention to send personnel to attend the future Danube River Navigation Conference is also one of the difficulties. Although Germany and Italy have decided to avoid conflict with the Soviet Union, the intrusion of Soviet power into the Danube River Basin and the Balkan Peninsula is a serious threat to Germany and Italy's policy of establishing a new order in Southeastern Europe and must be prevented in advance. For this reason, it is feared that it will be difficult to find a compromise solution. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Madrid – The Spanish official news agency's Rome dispatch stated that the saying that Spain will join the war on the side of the Axis powers is absurd. However, it is obvious that Spain's position in Europe is different from that of a mere observer. The Spanish "Falange" newspaper's Rome dispatch mentioned the talks between Germany, Italy, and Spain, saying that Spain's relationship with the Axis powers can be regarded as friendly, but this does not allow for the prediction that Spain will participate in the war. US rumors that Spanish Interior Minister Suner is currently visiting Berlin to convey the proposal for a peaceful effort initiated by British Ambassador to Spain Hoare to overthrow Churchill. Newspaper reporters in Berlin, Spain, will be cautious in responding to it, since these rumors are purely unfounded. Hoare is loyal to the government, and the Spanish and British also believe that final victory will belong to the British side. Only a few Madrid newspapers publish words that are inclined to the Axis powers. After the second incident, Spain's "Voltoza" was sunk between the ports of Huelva and Bilbao. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop left here at 6:00 PM yesterday, returning to Berlin in an armored car. The most well-informed sources believe that Spain will soon join Germany and Italy in fighting against England, so as to concentrate attacks on Gibraltar. In addition, it is believed that an agreement has been reached in Southeastern Europe and that Albania, controlled by Italy, has made territorial demands on Greece and southern.

<h3>Musings on the European War (10) (2) Hitler's Triumphal Return</h3>
<p>Hitler returned to Berlin in triumph on July 6th from Paris. Suburbs lined with welcomers, the whole city in jubilee, a ceremonial occasion even greater than Caesar's. Although the final victory or defeat of the war has not yet been determined, Germany, since being bound by the Treaty of Versailles, has striven for twenty-two years to finally have this day of raising its eyebrows and exhaling, so it is no wonder that Hitler, on his face that always seems to be sealed by severe frost, actually had a smile on his face that day, and all his demeanor was relaxed and lively. That day, the headlines of Berlin newspapers hailed him as the greatest victor in annihilating warfare in world history...God of War...Military Genius...Great Statesman, Aggregate of Supreme Leaders...Victor of 1940, Surpassing the Victor of 1918...Leader of Eighty Million People...Leader from Darkness to Light, exaggerating flattery to the utmost. The following is a record of the grand occasion at the time, as recorded by the New York Times' correspondent in Berlin:</p>
<p>Hitler returned to Berlin's Haltern Station from the front lines at around 3:00 PM on July 6th. Air Minister General Goering and senior government officials were all at the station to welcome him. Hitler's special flower-adorned train car was pulled by two locomotives with flags hanging, and two anti-aircraft gun vehicles escorted along the way. The station platform was covered with a red carpet, and civil and military officials were lined up on the left and right according to the ranking of their official positions, respectfully welcoming him. When Hitler got out of the car, Goering and others stepped forward to shake hands to welcome him. Goering was originally fat and ungainly, but since the two months of war, he has been galloping on the battlefield and has become slightly thinner and more energetic. Following Hitler out of the car were General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, among others. Outside the red carpet on the platform, there was also a large silver-gray Iron Cross medal made of pine needles, holly, and red and blue flowers, to celebrate the great achievements of the National Socialist Party leader.</p>
<p>As soon as Hitler stepped from the flower car onto the platform, all the church bells in Berlin rang out sonorously, and only stopped when he arrived at the Prime Minister's Office. He nodded to the officials standing to the left and right as a courtesy, and received the welcoming salute of the National Socialist Youth League. To the sound of the stormtrooper's military music, he stepped into an open-top car; at this time, the Youth League and Girls' League on the opposite platform shouted "Victory...Victory..." endlessly, and the sound waves rose and fell, until the car drove away before it stopped. The platform was brightly lit with torches, and the entrance to the station was decorated with colorful arches, fluttering flags, and banners with floral designs, making it very bright and eye-catching. The handrails of the escalators leading from the station door to the street were woven with garlands of boxwood leaves, symbolizing the glory of victory. The streets were guarded by the Guards, fully armed, three steps one sentry. Each was majestic and exceptionally imposing.</p>
<p>The streets on either side of the one-mile-long street from the station to the Prime Minister's Office were packed with Berlin citizens welcoming Hitler. Propaganda Minister Goebbels had notified the men, women, and children of Berlin that morning, telling them to welcome the head of state with sincere expressions. Calling them to run into the streets and admire the head of state's demeanor. Therefore, the bustling scene on both sides of the avenue was truly beyond the power of words to describe. In advance, German wireless radio had also warned residents not to throw flowers at the head of state as he passed through the streets of Berlin. All flowers offered must be placed on the road before the vehicles passed. The Girls' League and the police had scattered roses and other fresh flowers along the streets before 3:00 AM, creating a gorgeous and fragrant scene.</p>
<p>From 7:00 AM, under the dim sunlight, many men and women were already waiting by the side of the road, carrying paper bags containing the food they would use as breakfast and lunch. Members of the National Socialist Party were distributing small swastika flags by the side of the road. Ice cream vendors could not meet the demand, and ice cream was sold by the ton. There were also those selling simple telescope boxes, and they were also making a lot of money. Wireless loudspeakers were installed on the utility poles at the intersections. Those who were far away or could not squeeze onto the side of the road to watch could listen to all the excitement through the wireless radio broadcast.</p>

<p>(Above) Hitler, Goering, and others in a Photo After the Signing of the French-German Armistice</p>
<p>(Left) Girls Along the Way Scattered Flowers to Welcome</p>
<p>Ahead of Hitler's car was a car filming a movie, and behind it was Goering's car, one person sitting in one car. Behind them were several cars with senior government officials. The foreign news agency reporters were sitting together in one car. All the officials were wearing military uniforms, fully expressing the spirit of military conquest of other countries. Among them, only economic expert Dr. Schacht wore civilian clothes, and National Socialist Party theorist Dr. Rosenberg sat in the same car. Parading in the rows of the street were also several thousand male and female workers, led by National Socialist Party officers, with the sound of military music constantly ringing in their ears. The Youth League and the Girls' League also participated. According to police estimates, the number of people marching was no less than 200,000.</p>
<p>At 3:16 PM, Hitler's car arrived at the gate of the Prime Minister's Office. A guard of honor was standing at the gate, ready for the head of state to review them, but Hitler did not get out of the car, only returned their salute in the car. There were also several wounded soldiers returning from the front lines waiting. As soon as the car arrived, one of them ran to the front of the car and shook hands with Hitler to pay his respects. Four minutes later, Hitler appeared on the balcony of the Prime Minister's Office building. At this time, the crowd cheered, and the band played the National Socialist Party anthem. The crowd all sang along in a loud voice. Overcome with excitement, everyone cheered loudly, and some even cried with joy.</p>
<p>When Hitler was on the balcony, he was attended by General Goering, General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Ribbentrop, and Deputy Party Leader Hess. As Hitler raised his arm to salute the crowd, everyone sang the song "We are Attacking England." Because of the heat and the large number of people, coupled with extreme excitement, many women fainted. Fortunately, Red Cross nurses had already prepared and poured cold water on those who had fainted. Hitler watched on the balcony for a while and then retreated.</p>
<p>The crowd still did not disperse. At 3:37 PM, the wireless loudspeaker reported: "Attention everyone. The head of state will meet with you again: please wait a moment and then disperse." At 3:55 PM, Hitler appeared on the balcony again, with Goering standing to his left. He went back in about 13 minutes. The loudspeaker immediately told everyone to disperse, and then the people gradually dispersed. At this point, the grand occasion of the day quickly disappeared.</p>

<h3>Sincere Negotiations in the Electric Tram Strike; Hope for a Satisfactory Resolution; Although No Results Yesterday, the Attitude was Sincere; Both Sides Agreed to Continue Talks This Morning</h3>
<p>The strike of all the workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company in the Public Concession, which began on the 20th of this month, has now been going on for four days. Although the workers had put forward four temporary conditions for resolution, the direct negotiations between the two parties were delayed by two days because the 20th and 22nd were Saturday and Sunday. However, both labor and management, the Concession authorities, and people from all walks of life all hope that the negotiations will have a satisfactory outcome, that traffic within the Concession will be restored immediately, and that they do not want the strike to affect society and be criticized by all parties. This is because public utilities relate to the welfare of the entire citizenry, and disputes between labor and management cannot be rashly triggered, creating large waves. If both parties can take the overall situation as the premise and make concessions to each other, then negotiations will be easier to approach, but this spirit of self-sacrifice must be based on the sincerity and cooperation of the negotiators. It is rumored that the result of the direct negotiations between labor and management yesterday was that the two sides only disputed the issue of wage increases for more than half an hour, and there were still no satisfactory results. As for the remaining three conditions, they were also rejected by the company authorities. Negotiations should continue today, but judging from the current situation, there are still many focal points ahead, and optimism is not yet warranted. The situation obtained yesterday is recorded below, divided as follows:</p>
<p>Direct Negotiations Between the Two Parties Yesterday</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, four representatives of all the workers of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Tramway Company went to the Tramway Company on South Suzhou Road to meet with Mr. Bullock, Secretary-General of the company. Mr. Bullock personally received them, and the labor and management then held direct negotiations in the manager's office on the third floor of the company. The labor representatives submitted the four conditions that had already been revised to Mr. Bullock, and said that this was the minimum requirement of all the workers, hoping that the company authorities would approve it immediately so that they could resume work that day and reassure people.</p>
<p>Stalemate on the Wage Issue</p>
<p>After Mr. Bullock accepted the four conditions proposed by labor, he replied to the layer regarding the wage increase as follows: (1) Increase the daily wage by 15 cents; (2) Allowance of 5 cents; (3) Rice subsidy of 10 cents, totaling an increase of 30 cents per day. This is an increase of 5 cents compared to the company's reply to the previous negotiations, which only allowed an allowance of 25 cents. However, the conditions proposed by labor were to cancel the allowance and increase the daily wage by a total of 45 cents. The difference between this and the 30 cents agreed to by the company was still 15 cents. The two sides disputed for half an hour, and there was still no way to resolve it, so that the remaining three conditions, (1) not to dismiss workers on the pretext of anything, Mr. Bullock still said that it should be handled according to usual practice, (2) (3) Wages paid during the strike period and Article 22 of the Labor-Management Mutual Benefit Agreement, Mr. Bullock did not reply to these.</p>
<p>New Developments Possible Today</p>
<p>The labor and management sides held talks for more than an hour, but because the conditions were still far apart, they failed to achieve a satisfactory outcome. At around 11:00 AM, the labor representatives resigned and said that after discussing the conditions replied to by the company with all the workers, they would go to the company again at 10:00 AM this morning to consult and seek a solution. Also, according to investigations, the attitude of both labor and management yesterday was sincere, and if the meeting is held again today, there may be new developments.</p>
<p>Workers State That Livelihood is Difficult</p>
<p>According to a certain worker, the reason for their proposed conditions is that their wages are only half the wages of the tram workers in the French Concession. Their monthly wages are only 70 yuan. Under the current severe inflation, it is difficult to maintain the warmth and food of a family, so they are demanding that the company authorities increase their wages by 13 yuan per month. This is only because they are forced by livelihood. The company often dismisses workers who are deemed to be in poor health when conducting physical examinations every year. This move causes workers who have served for a longer period of time and who are older to suffer the pain of unemployment, and the company has no method of relief. As for the Labor-Management Mutual Benefit Agreement, the content is items that both sides can benefit from.</p>
<p>Total Number of Electric Trams in the Concession is Tallied</p>
<p>The electric trams on each route in the Public Concession are as follows: 22 on Route 1, 30 on Route 2, 12 on Route 3, 1 on Route 5, 6 on Route 6, 4 on Route 9, 10 on Route 14, 38 on Route 16, 27 on Route 17, 7 on Route 18, 10 on Route 19, 16 on Route 20, 7 on Route 21, and 8 on Route 24, totaling 198. There are also about 10 that are regularly stopped at the factory for repairs. Since the complete suspension of operations, in addition to increasing the number of vehicles dispatched to each route, the buses have also "processed and repaired" dozens of old cars that have been shelved for a long time and did not intend to operate in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, and immediately added them to each route. The preparations for the factories, docks, and other places near the electric tram company are still strictly carried out by the Chinese and Western detectives dispatched by the two police departments.</p>
<p>The Company Expresses Sincere Cooperation</p>
<p>A certain staff member of the Public Concession Electric Tram Company told a certain Western newspaper reporter yesterday that the solution proposed by the company was already very fair, and that its treatment of the workers could not be said to be poor. This is because, under the current solution, a newly hired worker can receive a salary of 75 yuan per month, that is, the lowest salary for a worker is 66.2 yuan, plus a rice subsidy of 9 yuan. The salary of most workers at present is 84 yuan per month, plus a rice subsidy of 9 yuan. Although he hoped that the workers would accept the solution proposed by the company, he was not too optimistic. He continued, no matter what, the company should do everything in its power to resolve the strike as soon as possible. During this period, the trams in the Public Concession are still completely stopped, but the tram traffic in the French Concession is still proceeding unhindered.</p>
<h3>Admiral Hart is Coming to Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" states that the minesweeper USS Pigeon of the US Asiatic Fleet, which came to Shanghai from North China last week, is expected to sail out tomorrow (the 24th) to Manila for the winter. Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon aboard his flagship USS Augusta, stay for two or three weeks, and then depart. It is also learned that the admiral's private yacht, the Isabel, will return to Shanghai tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Drastic Changes in the Situation in Vietnam; Shanghai is Deeply Indignant; Japanese Warships in the Huangpu River Departed from the Wusong Estuary Heading South; The Defense Situation in Zhejiang and Fujian is Relaxed on the Outside but Tight on the Inside; Ship Schedules on the Shanghai-Vietnam Route Have Not Changed at Present</h3>
<p>The situation in Vietnam is tense. The French-Japanese agreement was suddenly signed, and there is talk of Japanese troops landing. Yesterday, the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road, north of the Garden Bridge, released a balloon that ascended high into the air, with eight red characters trailing below, saying "Japanese Troops Occupy French Indochina." When the news spread, the citizens believed that the French government was exposing an unfriendly attitude towards China and were very indignant.</p>
<p>Saigon Ship Schedules</p>
<p>As for the various shipping companies in this city, they have not yet received reports from their local branches, nor have they received orders from the port to change their routes, so as of last night, the ship schedules on the Shanghai-Vietnam route of each ship have not changed. Jardine Matheson's Yushan is still scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Haiphong on the 27th, and the Mingsheng is scheduled to go from Shanghai to Haiphong on October 1. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan is scheduled to set sail from Shanghai on the 26th, passing through Hong Kong to Haiphong and concurrently Guangzhou Bay. Future changes are still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Heading South</p>
<p>Japanese warships docked in the Huangpu River departed from the Wusong Estuary heading south, seemingly with some intention. According to telegrams obtained by the shipping industry from eastern Zhejiang yesterday, no less than 20 Japanese warships are currently docked in the vicinity of Zhenhai, Xiangshan Port, and the Oujiang Estuary. However, Japanese warships have spied on places such as Shipu from time to time. However, they have not succeeded in the end. There are also several armed patrol ships converted from Japanese merchant ships that have been constantly cruising along the coast for days, attempting to monitor the incoming and outgoing voyages of ships.</p>
<p>Three Ships Missing</p>
<p>The shipping industry learned that more than ten foreign ships had recently sailed to the Biejin and Wenzhou. Except for a very small number of ships that were able to unload passengers and goods at or near their destinations, and those that had already been blocked and returned, there were still several foreign ships that had no news. Among them, the Anli was stranded on the waters of the Oujiang Estuary (that is, the Ellis Meller), and a telegram had arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The Jiangsu was detained in the waters of Ligang and has not been released. As for the remaining three ships, Daxin, Dali, and Dasheng, their whereabouts are even more unknown. It is expected that they must have been blocked by Japanese warships in another place. As for the British ship Mary Meller, which was shelled by Japanese warships in the waters of Haimen, it has been released, and the Japanese side has agreed to compensate for the losses caused by the shelling.</p>
<p>One Ship Aground</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" states that the Ellis Meller (1,600 tons) and Jesse Meller (1,800 tons), two ships of the British-owned Meller Company, are currently being detained by the Japanese naval authorities at a certain port near Wenzhou. This news was disclosed by the Meller Company's tugboat Carmen Meller after returning to Shanghai from Wenzhou this morning (the 23rd). Earlier, the company learned that the Ellis Meller was leaking near Wenzhou, so it sent the Carmen Meller to rescue it. The Ellis Meller was carrying a certain number of cargo passengers and ran aground and leaked water near Wenzhou last Friday.</p>
<p>Rescue Denied</p>
<p>The Jesse Meller happened to be sailing nearby, so it sailed close to the Ellis Meller to help, but it was seen by a Japanese naval patrol boat, which immediately escorted the two ships to a certain port (the name of which has not been disclosed) controlled by the Japanese side. On Saturday and Sunday afternoon, Carmen Meller's shipowner, Rossett, negotiated with the Japanese authorities to release the two ships, but to no avail, because the Japanese side insisted that further investigation was necessary before the two ships could be released. Carmen Meller then returned to Shanghai in disappointment. It is reported that the Meller Company is currently drafting a report on the matter and will submit it to the British naval authorities immediately.</p>
<h3>Father Jacquinot to Return to Shanghai at the End of the Month; Will Still Preside Over Relief Work</h3>
<p>Father Jacquinot, the former person in charge of the Nanshi Refugee Zone, resigned from his position because of the sudden outbreak of the war in his home country and the displacement of refugees, intending to serve his motherland. Unexpectedly, just after arriving in Hong Kong, France and Germany made peace. Father Jacquinot then dismissed the idea of leaving and stayed in Hong Kong for three months. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, Father Jacquinot has resolutely decided to return to Shanghai to preside over refugee relief work because he believes that the refugees here will suffer from freezing and hunger as the severe cold is approaching in the blink of an eye. His trip to Shanghai is scheduled to take place before the end of this month.</p>
<p>Since the start of the war, a large number of children have died in various places, and the situation of children who are homeless and displaced is indeed pitiful. The highest authorities have allocated large sums of money to establish a large number of orphanages and other relief agencies throughout the country. The Shanghai Branch of the National Children's Relief Association deeply feels that this kind of work is urgently needed and earnestly hopes that people from all walks of life in this city will enthusiastically donate.</p>
<p>If you have any donations, please send them to any branch of the government bank in this city at any time. Also, it is reported that the Moore Church on Yuchaqing Road in this city has always attached great importance to social services. It has recently taken in many street urchins, providing them with housing, food, and clothing, and providing them with production training. People from all walks of life who are willing to donate are requested to contact the person in charge of the church at telephone number 900545.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association Held Annual Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Anti-Tuberculosis Association in this city is organized by famous doctors and celebrities in Shanghai. The association holds an annual meeting every year. The annual meeting was held yesterday at the Health Association inside the American Women's Club on Jing'an Temple Road. More than 600 Chinese and Western celebrities attended, with refreshments and various entertainment programs. In addition, there were speeches by Professor Eberen and Dr. Diao Xinde, which was quite a grand occasion for a time.</p>
<h3>The United States Tightens Security Within its Defense Zone; Sends Troops to Station in Police Stations; Two Troops Stationed Permanently in Each of the Six Stations; Rumor That the Putuo Road Police Station was Attacked is Incorrect</h3>
<p>A senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department told reporters yesterday that two soldiers from the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment were ordered to garrison at the police stations within the US defense zone. This is a new system that began on Sunday (22). This has caused rumors that the Putuo Road Police Station was attacked by police from a certain party. The US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment used to patrol the six police stations in the US defense zone, but since Sunday (22), the method has changed, with two soldiers stationed at each police station. This is a routine security measure, not due to any accident. It is found that the six police stations located in the US defense zone are Laozha, Putuo Road, Jing'an Temple, Xinzha, Gordon Road, and Chengdu Road.</p>
<p>Attempted Seizure; Gunfire Stopped it</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" states that last night (the 22nd), a group of police officers from a certain party attempted to seize the Pudu Road Police Station and were stopped by the patrol officers of the police station, causing the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment soldiers to garrison the Pudu Road Police Station this morning (the 23rd). Official figures did not give a clear statement on this matter, but they could not deny that there were suddenly US soldiers stationed at the Pudu Road Police Station.</p>
<p>Bowen, Chief of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, said that he did not know of any accidents at the Pudu Road Police Station, and that he would have been notified if there had been an incident. However, according to credible sources, last night a number of police officers from a certain party attempted to take over the Putuo Road Police Station, and were shot at by patrol officers, thus averting the occurrence of a serious incident.</p>
<p>Also, according to a certain US military officer, everything is peaceful within the US defense zone, and the US military's garrisoning of the Pudu Road Police Station is not surprising, because the US military's move is only a new post, and the post is often mobile. Attempted</p>
<p>Attack on the Police Station</p>
<p>Regarding the matter, the officialdom did not make any statement, so the reason for it cannot be confirmed. At the same time, the Pudu Road Police Station was heavily guarded this morning. It is said that this move was to prevent any other party from seizing the police station. According to reports, the location of the Pudu Road Police Station is indeed quite difficult, as it is located on the edge of the Public Concession and is adjacent to the badlands.</p>
<h3>Dispute at the Isolated Army Camp: Resolution Expected Within Days - Agreement in Principle Reached, Further Discussions Needed for Post-Conflict Matters</h3>
<p>Regarding the dispute at the Isolated Army Camp, yesterday there were widespread rumors of a complete resolution. According to reliable sources, Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department (PWD), Mr. H.O. Hooper, Commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, Colonel Hempton, and Commander of the White Russian Detachment, Major Mann, met with Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan the day before yesterday afternoon. Although the detailed content of the meeting is unknown, it is confirmed that the opinions of both sides are approaching agreement. Principles have been agreed upon regarding ensuring the security of the concession, upholding the Isolated Army's upright stance, clarifying responsibility for the incident, preventing similar incidents from happening again in the future, and adopting thorough measures to obtain possible and reliable guarantees. Several minor issues, such as the financial burden of the Isolated Army and the post-conflict arrangements for the dead and wounded soldiers, still need to be discussed further for appropriate resolution. In summary, both sides are willing to engage in discussions with candor and sincerity, hoping to seek a thorough and permanent solution. The so-called complete and satisfactory resolution is premature. Yesterday, the barbed wire in front of the Isolated Army Camp was not removed, the gate remained tightly closed, visitors were not received, and there was no sign of relaxed security.</p>
<p>External Gifts Can Now Be Delivered</p>
<p>According to another source, a PWD official told a Western reporter that the news of the resolution of the Isolated Army Camp incident seems likely to be confirmed. He said that food and medical supplies for treating the wounded can now be freely delivered into the Isolated Army Camp. At the same time, police and the White Russian Detachment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps are still maintaining strict guard around the Isolated Army Camp. The Isolated Army in the camp still had no electric lights at night, and powerful searchlights continued to shine into the camp. The PWD official also said that the Isolated Army Camp was very quiet yesterday, and the conflict between the Chinese army and the French guards in the French Concession concentration camp has also been resolved. The French Concession authorities are now working hard to improve the food in the concentration camp.</p>
<p>PWD Donates Large Quantities of Food</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the PWD Information Office, yesterday (the 22nd) at around 2:00 PM, the PWD purchased lard, salt, and a large quantity of vegetables, long beans, and winter melon, totaling 600 catties, and sent them to the Isolated Army Camp on Jiaozhou Road. The situation there is currently quite calm. The resolution of this dispute is expected to be completed satisfactorily within days.</p>
<h3>Public Bus Negotiations: Harmonious Opinions - Meeting Process is Good - Further Discussions Still Needed - Labor Strike Can Be Avoided</h3>
<p>The labor-management dispute at the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, which has been brewing, held its second meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM at the company's second floor. Twelve labor representatives (four each from drivers, conductors, and coppersmiths) and company representatives from the traffic management department, discussed the matter. Neither side was willing to make any announcements about the results. According to a labor representative who spoke to a Datong News Agency reporter after the meeting, "The labor side requested the authorities to respond to the 23 demands previously made. Both sides engaged in negotiations with the utmost sincerity, based on a mutually beneficial standpoint. The process was good. However, due to the need for one or two more rounds of discussions, detailed content cannot be revealed at this time. What can be said is that the prospects for a satisfactory resolution are very promising. A labor strike will not break out even during the tram workers' strike. Both sides are willing to prioritize public safety and the interests of the citizens, therefore, they maintain an optimistic attitude."</p>
<p>Company Announcement States the Process</p>
<p>The company authorities issued a statement yesterday, declaring its position and the facts of the matter, divided into eight points. The original text reads: "In order to dispel all misunderstandings, the following process is specifically announced so that the company's employees can understand the truth. (1) On August 24 of this year, the labor representatives of the company first sent the original text of the 23 demands to the company. (2) The company authorities sent a reply on September 5 and published the reply in the announcement column. (3) Subsequently, last Wednesday (September 18), a rebuttal to the company's reply was submitted to the company authorities. The content of this rebuttal is largely the same as the original text of the demands sent on August 24. (4) It is a well-known fact that a response cannot be hastily made to requests with excessive conditions without thorough consideration. (5) The company deeply desires to seek a permanent understanding and is prepared to continue friendly consultations to achieve a satisfactory result. (6) According to Chinese newspaper reports, the company received requests for additional rice subsidies and coal subsidies last Friday. In order to clarify the truth and dispel misperceptions, the company specifically declares that no such requests were made during the consultations last Friday. (7) The company will publish various responses at any time and place in the future so that our employees can understand the proceedings of the meeting. (8) As for the rumors that the company's business is booming, this is completely untrue. The daily income is difficult to maintain the huge increase in operating expenses. Secretary-General: Ku Laiqi, September 23, 29th year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Postage Increase: First Day Yesterday - Remittances and Parcels Not Yet Subject to Additional Fees - New Stamps Being Rushed to Print</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the postage increase. A Datong News Agency reporter visited various postal branches in the two concessions yesterday. Many members of the public were able to affix sufficient postage according to the new increased rates when mailing items. However, there were also quite a few cases where insufficient postage was affixed and were discovered by the post office when stamping and returned to the sender for re-affixing. This is an inevitable phenomenon at the beginning of implementation and should gradually decrease in a few days. As for the decision to increase postage, it does not apply to remittance fees. Some members of the public who seek clarification of the postal law often speculate about this. In fact, the post office has been collecting supplementary water fees for remittance fees at any time due to transportation difficulties. The increase in this supplementary water fee does not need to be drafted by the Ministry of Communications and approved by the Executive Yuan, and the same is true for parcel postage. Both can be adjusted by the local post office depending on the transportation situation. As for the new postage stamps after this price increase, they are currently being rushed to print in Hong Kong. Before the printing is completed, old stamps will continue to be used, as long as they are affixed to the new rate. Even when the new stamps are issued in the future, the stamps currently in use can still be used for a considerable period of time before a notice is issued to abolish them within a certain period.</p>
<h3>Japanese Erect Barbed Wire Fence on Vacant Land in Penglai Market</h3>
<p>Recently, the Japanese hired a large number of coolies to erect barbed wire fences around the vacant land in the Penglai Market on Penglai Road in Nanshi. In July, more than 300 Japanese soldiers carried armored vehicles, small cannons, and heavy machine guns to conduct exercises there. This decision to add repairs indicates that the Japanese army will conduct exercises again on the vacant land.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Government: Restricts Chinese Entry - Must Obtain a Permit to Land - Residents Leaving Hong Kong Also Need a Permit</h3>
<p>In order to restrict the continued increase in the population of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government will establish an Immigration Bureau. Chinese residents of Hong Kong who leave Hong Kong must obtain a certificate from the Immigration Bureau, similar to a passport, and present it to the Immigration Bureau for verification upon returning to Hong Kong before being allowed entry. Chinese people who do not reside in Hong Kong and wish to come to Hong Kong must obtain a passport or entry permit in advance before being allowed entry. Chinese people will no longer be able to enter and leave Hong Kong as freely as before. This method can be officially implemented within this month after it is passed by the Legislative Council.</p>

<h3>Flour Merchants Hoarding and Speculating, Market Prices Chaotic - Authorities Issue Announcement Promising Severe Punishment - Factory Prices are Enough for Reasonable Cost-Based Pricing - Abnormal Flour Market Hinders People's Livelihoods - Citing Vietnamese Situation, Rice Market Fluctuated Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's announcement states: "It has been found that the retail flour merchants in the two concessions are selling flour daily that is supplied by the Shanfu Feng and Fuxin flour mills, with over eight thousand bags supplied daily (except Sundays). Shanfu Feng supplies five thousand bags, and Fuxin supplies over three thousand bags. The amount of flour received by each flour store is reported daily to the Public Works Department by the above two factories for verification. Currently, the factory price is sixteen yuan and fifty cents per bag, which has increased by one yuan compared to the previous week. This is enough to cover costs. The two flour mills, considering the overall situation, have decided not to raise prices further for the time being. As for the retail prices of each flour store, it was previously stipulated that each bag should be increased by three cents based on the factory price, and should not exceed that."</p>
<p>Disregarding the Overall Good: Severe Punishment Will Be Given</p>
<p>"However, recently, a small number of flour stores, fearing that factory prices will rise again, have been hoarding the flour they receive and are unwilling to sell it, resulting in an abnormal flour market with chaotic prices. This situation hinders the livelihood of the people and is no small matter. The authorities of the two concessions have recently received numerous reports from users and have paid close attention to this matter. In the future, if anyone disregards the overall good and continues to hoard and speculate, once the facts are verified, severe punishment will be imposed according to law in order to stabilize the market and maintain the food supply."</p>
<p>Rice Market Fluctuated Again Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>"The rice prices in rice shops, tea houses, and market stalls have been quite stable recently. Public sentiment has shifted downwards, and market prices are unanimously expected to fall. After the market opened at 7:30 yesterday morning, public sentiment suddenly became firm again. Speculators vigorously raised market prices, sparing no effort. The market situation was chaotic and abnormal. Speculators cited the tense situation in Vietnam, claiming that Japanese troops had landed and the source of foreign rice would be cut off. Therefore, large households tightly hoarded existing stocks, and the number of customer accounts increased, resulting in a shortage of existing stocks in the market and prices were uniformly raised. As a result, new domestic rice, japonica, and thick japonica rice all increased by two yuan compared to the previous listing price. The private sale price of foreign rice also increased by five to seven or eight cents. According to rice industry insiders, even if Japanese troops have indeed landed in Vietnam, the impact on the source of foreign rice is minimal. Although Saigon foreign rice may not be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities in the future, it can still be transshipped from other ports. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship transported more than 6,400 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. In addition, Siamese foreign rice will not be cut off at that time and can still be transported to Shanghai for regulation. Furthermore, the source of domestic rice has increased compared to the previous days. If the hoarded rice can be released on schedule, then rice prices are still expected to fall."</p>
<h3>New Japanese Consul General to Shanghai Arrived Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>"After the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura Yoshiaki, was ordered to be transferred to Mexico as a minister, the newly appointed Consul General, Horiuchi Kanjyo, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon aboard the Taiyo Maru. Horiuchi is a well-known expert on China. After graduating from the Japanese Tongwen College in Shanghai, he returned to Japan and entered university to major in law. He was originally the director of the East Asia Division of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Since the change of the Japanese cabinet, when Konoe returned to power, he was transferred to his current position, concurrently serving as a counselor at the embassy. As for Miura Yoshiaki, after the handover procedures are completed, he will depart for Japan on the 26th, stay briefly, and then go to Mexico to take office."</p>
<h3>PWD Mounted Patrol Holds Farewell Drill - Inspected Yesterday at the Gordon Road Police Station - Chairman and Chief Constable Present to Preside Over Ceremony</h3>
<p>"Yesterday was the date for the PWD Mounted Patrol to hold a farewell drill. At 2:00 PM, amidst drizzling rain, this long-standing Indian police mounted patrol made its final gathering at the Gordon Road Police Station training ground. At that time, the police officers dressed neatly and mounted their horses, first taking a group photo for remembrance. Then, Chairman Ke Ziwei and Chief Constable Bowen, and Deputy Chief Constable Robertson, who manages the mounted patrol, inspected them once and gave a speech in English on the spot, which was translated into Hindi by an interpreter. Ke first stated the reasons for the disbandment of the mounted patrol, roughly saying, since the operation of horse-drawn carriages on Jing'an Temple Road, things have changed, which is not the same as in the past. In this era of mechanization, the patrol of various roads outside the boundary, in addition to the mounted patrol, can be replaced by other methods, which are more effective and more economical, and so on. Then, he reviewed the past history of the mounted patrol. The meaning of his words was quite concise. After the speech, they dispersed."</p>
<h3>Case of Murder in the Da Zhonghua Hotel - Younger Brother Plots to Kill Older Brother - Does Not Engage in Proper Occupation and Covets Older Brother's Money - Colludes to Commit Murder and Ultimately Cannot Escape the Net of Justice</h3>
<p>"On the night of the 24th of last month, a murder case suddenly occurred in room 528 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel on Yuchiaqing Road. The deceased, named Zhou Xiuzheng, was from Huzhou, 24 years old, and lived at No. 49 Fengyu Lane, Saposai Road. He was the chief accountant at the Liyuan and Fuyuan customs broker on Gongguan Road in the French Concession. He was strangled to death in that room. At the time, the police were unable to find out the cause of Zhou's death and who the murderer was."</p>
<p>Great Violation of Ethics</p>
<p>"Now, after a month of detailed investigation by Liu Junjie, detective of the Old Gate Police Station, and detectives Zhang Bingchun, the ins and outs of this case have been completely clarified. It is actually a case of a younger brother plotting to kill his own brother. Since the war, the morals of Shanghai have changed greatly, and there have been great violations of ethics. There has been a tragic case of a parent killing their biological father and dismembering the body to destroy the evidence, followed by an incident of a younger brother attempting to shoot his older brother unsuccessfully, and then the occurrence of this case, which is really regrettable."</p>
<p>Does Not Engage in Proper Occupation "The deceased, Zhou Xiuzheng's younger brother, Zhou Xiude, is 18 years old. He usually does not engage in proper occupation and specializes in wandering. He often goes to gambling dens to gamble, causing him to be economically strapped from time to time. He repeatedly asked his brother for loans, which were often rejected, causing Xiude to harbor resentment. He secretly thought that his brother was in charge of the financial power of the two customs brokers, so he planned to kill him in order to seize the funds he was in charge of. Once the evil thoughts were born, he disregarded the great righteousness."</p>
<p>Induced to Go to a Hotel</p>
<p>"He immediately discussed with a bad friend, Mr. Jia, and decided that at about 4:00 PM on the 24th of last month, Xiude would invite his brother, Xiuzheng, to room 528 of the Da Zhonghua Hotel, and then go to see a movie at Shanghai Light. After returning to the hotel, Xiude invited Mr. Jia, as well as Tao Defeng (also known as A Gou) from Tongzhou and Ni Shiqi (also known as Guo Cong) from Haimen, to have dinner at the hotel together. He then summoned Tao Wang, a Suzhou woman (also known as Wang Xiuling, 17 years old, who is Tao Defeng's concubine) from the Queen's Guide Agency on Shantou Road to persuade him to drink."</p>
<p>Intoxicated with Wine and Women</p>
<p>"Xiude used wine and women to intoxicate his brother. Xiuzheng did not know this and fell into his trap. At 10:30 PM, Zhou Xiuzheng was already drunk. Tao then sent Wang Xiuling away and then acted violently, strangling Zhou Xiuzheng with a rope. Zhou Xiude obtained the keys to the Liyuan and Xinyuan silver boxes from the deceased's body and went to the customs broker to steal more than 580 US dollar tickets, worth 10,000 yuan, and a check for 2,600 yuan."</p>
<p>Murder for Money</p>
<p>"He then summoned Wang Xiuling, told her the truth, and instructed her not to make a fuss. Zhou Xiude and others thought that this matter was unknown to the gods and ghosts, but it was discovered by the detectives. The detectives arrested Zhou Xiude at No. 49 Fengyu Lane, Saposai Road, the day before yesterday, and arrested Tao Defeng, Ni Baoqi, Wang Xiuzhen, and a fellow villager, Zhu Qitai, at No. 5 Yongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, in the French Concession. Mr. Jia had fled to other ports. Zhou Xiude confessed that after killing his brother and obtaining the money, except for 200 yuan owed to the gambling den, the rest of the money was taken away by Mr. Jia and fled."</p>
<p>The Net of Heaven is Vast</p>
<p>"Tao Defeng, after being arrested, committed suicide by swallowing fragments of his glasses in fear of punishment. After the detectives discovered this, they were rushed to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, this case was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police attorney, Ru Baoyi, requested permission for temporary detention and rescheduling for another hearing because this case still needs to be further investigated and the fugitives must be arrested. Judge Xiao Xiefei interrogated each of the defendants once and ordered them to be detained to await rescheduling for another hearing."</p>
<h3>Female Servant Colludes with Her Husband to Commit Robbery - Principal Offender Killed on the Spot - Female Servant and Two Male Bandits Arrested Together</h3>
<p>"Zhu Fulin, a native of Yangzhou, is 31 years old and works as a barber at the Huiguang Barber Shop at No. 3 Yangjing Bridge, Jiangxi Road. His wife, Wu, also known as A Jin, is 21 years old and works as a maid for Guangdong woman Zheng Liang at No. 16 Qingyun Lane, La'erdong Road, in the French Concession.

<p>Communicated with His Wife</p>
<p>"He wanted to rob the property of his wife's employer, Zheng Liang. He first made a fake pistol. On the evening of the 22nd, Zhu first asked his concubine, Wang Yang (28 years old and from the same hometown as Zhu), to notify his wife that the robbery was approved for that night. At the same time, Zhu also colluded with his wife's cousin, Jiang Songlin (21 years old, from Yangzhou, and works as a helper at the Ximen Ximen bathhouse). At 10:00 PM that night, Zhu, holding a small knife, and Jiang, holding a fake pistol, went to Zheng Liang's house, knocked on the back door, and Zhu Wu and Wang Yang opened the door, letting Zhu Jiang in. They first chatted in the kitchen, waiting."</p>
<p>Waiting for Late at Night</p>
<p>"At 2:00 AM, knowing that the master, Zheng Liang, and her children were all asleep, Zhu and the four men and women entered the living room, first tied up the master's daughter, Xiao Mei, and then went upstairs to enter the room. Zhu Jiang showed off the fake pistol and small knife, threatening them to silence them. Then, after tying up Liang, they searched her body for a bunch of keys and 15 yuan in cash, and Zhu Jiang used the keys to open the wardrobe and search, obtaining a gold watch, two gold rings, 115 yuan in cash, and clothes, dividing them into three packages and throwing them downstairs to Zhu Wu Wang Yang."

Detective Shen Jinshu led detectives Chen Fusheng, Zhou Qingfang, Zhang Yulin, and patrol officers, and drove in police cars to the back door of the victim's house to wait. They first saw Zhu Wu and Wang Yang each holding packages and escaping, and immediately arrested them. Then they saw the two thieves, Zhu Jiang, escape. The detectives saw them holding guns under the lights."</p>
<p>Resisting Form</p>
<p>"Detective Zhang Yulin fired three shots in a row, hitting Zhu in the left shoulder, left waist, and right leg, causing him to fall to the ground with injuries. When Jiang saw Zhu being shot down, he froze and did not dare to move, and was arrested. The fake pistol, knife, and stolen goods were seized. The detectives took Jiang and Wu Yang back to the police station for investigation. Zhu was sent to Guangci Hospital, but due to serious injuries, he died before he could be treated. The body was moved to the Tongren Fuyuan branch for examination. The prosecutor of the Second Special Court was immediately requested to come to the site for identification at noon. The body was buried by the charitable hall."</p>

After that, they went to collect it several times, but were repeatedly rejected, saying that the cloth had been sent to Kaizier Road Baodaxiang and Xiedaxiang foreign goods stores for consignment. Antai conducted an investigation and found that Baodaxiang did have the goods, but Xiedaxiang did not consign them.

<h3>Fujian Provincial Government Formulates Measures to Subsidize Food for Staff and Students, Stipulating Food Expenses and the Amount of Rice Purchased Per Yuan, Entrusting Public Grains Bureau and County Governments to Purchase on Behalf</h3>
<p>(Yong'an Dispatch) The Fujian Provincial Government has formulated interim measures for subsidizing the food of staff and students of secondary and higher schools, primary school teachers, and social education personnel in wartime. These measures have been proposed, passed by the Provincial Government Council, and announced for implementation. The resolutions are recorded as follows: (1) In order to subsidize the food of staff and students of secondary and higher schools, primary school teachers, and social education personnel in this province during wartime, the Fujian Provincial Government, in accordance with the Executive Yuan's order promulgating interim measures for subsidizing the food of college and secondary school students in wartime, and with reference to the local situation in this province, formulates these measures.</p>
<p>Provincial Vocational Schools and Secondary Schools</p>
<p>(2) For students in provincial vocational and higher schools and normal schools whose food expenses are paid by the Provincial Government, starting from this semester, the food expenses for the last month of the semester will be paid in advance at the beginning of each semester. The remaining expenses will be paid monthly until the end of the semester, at which time the advance payment for the last month will be deducted to settle the account. (3) For students in provincial vocational and higher schools and normal schools whose food expenses are paid by the Provincial Government, the monthly amount is set at eight yuan. The required rice will be purchased on behalf of the schools by the local Public Grains Bureau, grain purchasing agency, or county government, and the price will be paid according to the purchase and transportation costs. Each person will be issued 30 market catties of brown rice, with a standard issuance price of 6 market catties per yuan. If the cost is more than 6 market catties per yuan, it should be calculated according to the cost. If the cost is less than 6 market catties per yuan, the amount of the loss should be settled by the school on a monthly basis, and a distribution budget and student roster should be prepared, along with the wholesale order and receipt from the agent, and submitted to the Provincial Government for approval. The aforementioned loss funds will also be advanced by the Provincial Government for one month's equivalent amount to facilitate turnover. (4) For students in provincial senior and junior high schools and senior and junior vocational schools, a monthly food allowance of a certain amount will be issued by the Provincial Department of Education, taking into account the local rice prices and the current number of students in each school. Each school should establish a committee to review the number of needy students who should receive the allowance, and the standards for student food allowances will be determined separately. (5) Starting from this semester, provincial senior and junior high schools and senior and junior vocational schools will pre-pay the funds required for student rice for the last month of the semester at the beginning of the semester, entrusting the local Public Grains Bureau, grain purchasing agency, or county government to purchase and distribute it on their behalf, according to the cost of purchase and transportation, with a standard of 30 market catties per student per month. If the schools are located in rice-producing areas, they may also use the pre-paid funds for one month and the student fees collected to make adjustments and purchase rice in advance.</p>
<p>County and Private Schools at All Levels</p>
<p>(6) The rice required for teachers and staff of county and provincial schools at all levels, Zhongshan People's Schools, and social education personnel should be calculated according to the number of people, at 30 market catties per person per month, with a standard of 5 market catties per yuan. It should be purchased and distributed on behalf of the schools by the local Public Grains Bureau, grain purchasing agency, or county government. The loss funds should be requested from the provincial treasury by provincial schools according to the procedures stipulated in Article 3. County schools should be borne by the county treasury. Before unified supply, rice allowances equivalent to the subsidized standard price (30 market catties per person per month, 5 market catties per yuan) may be given instead. (7) The county governments should consider the local situation and refer to the measures for provincial junior high schools and junior vocational schools to provide unified relief for students' rice in county junior high schools and junior vocational schools, and report to the Provincial Government for record. (8) For rice for staff, students, laborers, and primary school teachers of private secondary and higher schools, each school should prepare a list based on the actual situation and consult with the local county government or district office to assist in purchasing. If in a rice-producing area, rice may also be purchased in advance according to actual needs. If transportation is required, the county governments and military, police, and transportation agencies may be consulted to provide full assistance and convenience for the required boats, vehicles, manpower, and transportation.

However, if each county can buy more than five market catties of rice per yuan at half price, the rice for staff and students of the local school shall still be purchased at market prices and shall not be subject to the provisions of these measures.

<h3>Unhappy Incident in Charity Basketball Challenge Match, Yuan Ludeng Has Been Appointed to Mediate, Please Bailemen to Make an Effort, No Reply Has Been Received from the Team as of Yesterday</h3>
<p>The unhappy incident caused by the boos of some ignorant spectators in the charity basketball challenge match has now caused a great uproar. Bailemen officially sent a letter to the Orphanage yesterday, stating its difficulties and declining future invitations. The spark has already ignited a prairie fire, not only affecting the suspension of charity, but also causing true fans to lose the opportunity to appreciate a series of good shows. Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Orphanage, expressed deep regret about this and volunteered to mediate in order to restore the grand event. Yesterday, he personally sent Chief Executive Pan Hongding to persuade the person in charge of Bailemen, asking them to make an effort for the education of more than 600 orphans. However, Bailemen needs to consult the opinions of all team members before replying, so there was no result yesterday.</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng's Statement</p>
<p>Yuan Ludeng issued a statement yesterday, saying that this charity competition was promoted to raise funds for the Orphanage. Such as the United Cup, the mini-football, and this challenge match, have been greatly supported by all sectors of society, which is very grateful. The players' efforts and the audience's donations are both a charitable goal, and should be respected each other. Even if the players have occasional performances that do not meet public opinion, they should be understood. Moreover, in high-level artistic performances, it is permissible that in the ever-changing and tense competition, without understanding the skills, they arbitrarily boo. One person advocates it, and thousands of people blindly follow. And after the event, when asked, the blind followers did not understand what they were responding to. Therefore, strict adherence to order is necessary. This kind of meaningless action, small enough to hurt feelings, big enough to spoil things. A wonderful game, often because of this meaningless stimulation, makes the players' psychology in the field abnormal. This challenge match was initiated, and Bailemen bravely accepted it, which has shown its fearless spirit. And its excellent ball skills allow the audience to appreciate wonderful works, which is so fortunate. And its spirit of sacrificing for charity is even more admirable. It is unexpected that the addition of misfortune is close to ridicule. Putting yourself in their shoes, how can you not be discouraged? The occurrence of this unfortunate incident is deeply regrettable. However, in order to prevent the charity match from being interrupted, I have tried my best to mediate. I believe that Bailemen will be eager to do good deeds and will definitely be able to make an effort. But I hope that the enthusiastic audience, since they are here to support the charity match, should show a kind of sympathy to any team or player who is doing their best for charity, and do not deliberately criticize them, so as to disrupt the order of the venue.</p>

<h3>Silver and Money Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Zhonghui Defeats Guangdong, Four Games Tonight</h3>
<p>In the third Silver and Money Cup Table Tennis Tournament, Zhonghui fought against Guangdong at the Yinlian Club's ball room last night. Zhonghui relied on its average talent and led all the way.

<h3>The Future of the Pacific is Favorable to China, the Gold Market Suffers a Sudden Drop</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold underground market situation, after the gold market rose for several days last week, a sudden drop occurred at the beginning of the week. The reason is that there are rumors that China, the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States will take joint five-help actions in the Far East, and that they will provide economic assistance to China again. As a result, many households were frightened and released their urgent needs, and the floating air took the opportunity to make a move and increased their leverage. Although a certain money exchange industry took a unique approach and continued to absorb, it was ultimately in vain. The opening price was still 6,280 yuan. Although it rose to a high price of 6,290 yuan, the gold companies then fiercely came out of the multi-party, and the floating more followed to close, and it was heard that the exchange market was loosening, and when it fell below 6,240 yuan, there was a lack of buyers to maintain it, and it fell miserably into the 6,200 yuan mark, with the lowest seeing 6,175 yuan. The noon closing was still stable at 6,200 yuan. The market trend improved in the afternoon, and the floating air compensated. The initial opening was 6,220 yuan, and it improved to 6,240 yuan twice. As a result, it closed at 6,223 yuan, a drop of 57 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The total transaction volume was around 4,000 taels. Silver jewelry remained unchanged, and customs gold remained flat.</p>

<p>In the early morning, the exchange market was slightly weak, but people's hearts were divided. The gold companies had a strong desire to sell, which caused the price to rise. First, the gold companies did each other 20 taels, still at 6,280 yuan, without distinction between honor and disgrace compared to the weekend. After the opening, the money exchange industry slightly entered, once raising it to 6,290 yuan, but after that, the gold companies supported it, and a certain silver company violently stuffed it, selling short on behalf of customers. In addition, the exchange market soon hardened, and there were rumors of some negative news. Although a certain money exchange industry and the silver companies absorbed it in the middle, it immediately fell back to 6,240 yuan. Although it stood firm and hovered between 6,250 and 6,260 yuan, it eventually fell miserably into the 6,200 yuan mark due to the gold companies selling more and more vigorously. The silver companies did each other 30 taels, losing to 6,175 yuan. At noon, the number of sellers decreased, and a certain money exchange industry spared no effort to come to hold again. Before closing, it once rose back to 6,210 yuan, but the closing was ultimately 6,200 yuan. After the market opened in the afternoon, people's hearts turned slightly, and it immediately rose up under the buying wind.</p>

<p>Twenty yuan, the gold company entered the silver company with 20 taels, for 6,220 yuan. Later, after the gold company covered its short position, it rose to 6,240 yuan again. After that, the multi-party of a certain money exchange industry slightly withdrew. In addition, the gold companies came to sell at this time, and it fell slightly to 6,205 yuan. The exchange market then softened slightly, and there was also news of some positive news in Vietnam, and it rose again to 6,240 yuan. After entering, retail investors and silver companies spit it out, and by closing it was 6,223 yuan. As a result, it fell by 57 yuan compared to the previous day. The total daily fluctuation was 115 yuan. The selling price of the current gold standard card of the cash company is more than ten yuan higher according to the feverfew, and the purchase is reduced by thirty yuan. The current margin is more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few openings.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Has Not Been Listed</p>
<p>The exchange of silver jewelry is still unchanged. Datonghang still hangs the original price of 640 yuan. The new trade is similar to the upper price, and the purchase is reduced by about thirty yuan.</p>
<h3>Legal Tender Falls Consistently</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, due to the feverfew hovering downward, the British and American gold pounds also fell by 1.5 yuan each. The demand for British gold notes decreased slightly, and the market price decreased slightly by 0.25 yuan. The US gold notes rose and fell sharply. In the early morning, it once rose to 19 yuan, but due to rumors that the United States, China, and the Soviet Union had concluded a military alliance, the supply from all parties was abundant, and it once fell back to 18.67 yuan, eventually becoming 18.74 yuan, a drop of 0.16 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The demand for Hong Kong notes was relatively sluggish, and the market price was slightly soft. The Japanese gold notes initially continued to rise, but fell in the afternoon, eventually falling by 0.01 yuan. The evening market fell back to 1.51 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was slightly strong, and the market price was slightly soft. The evening market fell back to 1.17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Call Loan Rate Continues to Rise by One Cent, Frequent Small Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange draft discount rate did not stop falling, but instead expanded. In the morning, the discount rate was 20 yuan per thousand yuan for buying in and 23 yuan for selling out. In the afternoon, it continued to fall to 22 yuan, with the discount rate for buying in only 20 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous Saturday. The call loan rate of the Money Industry Association continued to rise by 0.01 yuan, reaching 0.12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food, Foreign Rice Arrives in an Endless Stream, Rice Merchants Take the Opportunity to Exaggerate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice was affected by the expansion of the Vietnam issue. The shippers took the opportunity to promote and raise prices, and the blindly following floating households rushed to absorb it. The scalping trade also emerged as a result. Therefore, the price of foreign rice in the early market soared by as much as 2 yuan. The profit-taking bulls then came out, and the afternoon market recovered by 1 yuan. As a result, it was only about 1 yuan higher. Annam japonica was surprisingly idle at 70.5 yuan. However, English and Chinese Company's original package No. 2 Saigon took the opportunity to rise to 77 yuan, and No. 2 Siam rose to 76.5 yuan, with more than 100 tons of transactions. There was active speculation in spot, with transactions reaching 8,000 to 9,000 bags.</p>
<p>The source of foreign rice is continuous. The Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (Sunday) with 6,471 bags loaded from Hong Kong and stopped at the company's wharf in the French Concession to unload. The unloading was completed yesterday (rent).</p>
<p>The source of glutinous rice was blocked, and there was a slight exhortation on this street. The market added a yuan or so. Kaijin Litte was 70 yuan to 68.2 yuan, Changdan white was 69.5 yuan to 68 yuan, Hong Kong special was 69.5 yuan to 68 yuan. The source of thick and thin broken japonica and other national rice continued to be blocked. Because foreign rice was seen to be firm and the actual sales moved slightly, the market price rose by nearly a yuan. It is estimated that Kaichang special japonica was 79.6 yuan to 78 yuan, ordinary was 76.7 yuan, Wuchang Su Kun japonica was 78 yuan, decided to 74.8 yuan, Qingpu thin broken was 79 yuan to 78 yuan, Nangang early broken original package was 76 yuan to 75.5 yuan, and Hu Jian was 73.5 yuan to 73 yuan.</p>
<p>The sources of new japonica tips from various routes in the past two days, transported out by water and land, were 4,500 to 6,000 bags. Because the actual forceps were quite expensive, the market price jumped by 2 or 3 yuan. Kai Dongxin was 74 yuan to 72 yuan, West Xinhao was 77 yuan and decided to 72 yuan, Taicang Jiading Sheep tip original package was 65.5 yuan, Hu Jianhao was 63 yuan to 64 yuan, and Xiang japonica was 78.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Rises Again: New High Price Seen at $18; 17,000 Tons of Foreign Wheat Arrive</h3>
<p>The flour market was increasingly tight yesterday. Due to strong sales, the available supply of spot goods fell short of demand. Second-grade flour from reputable mills increased by another half dollar, to $16.50. Mill and warehouse stocks were absorbed by囤戶, and the supply of筹码 was depleted, creating a new high peak of $18. Both rice and flour are trending higher. Due to difficulties in transporting flour into the concessions, the supply of Japanese-made flour is dwindling daily, and futures trading remains suspended. A large quantity of foreign flour is being transshipped to North China, and local Shanghai flour stocks are being hoarded for profit. The prices of 洋砲台 and 福壽 brands are approaching the $19 mark, and the market's upward trend is just beginning. Yesterday's wheat trading was not brisk, as supplies from the interior have been scarce for some time, and Shanghai's reserves are also low. Sellers are holding firm to their intentions, but Japanese mills show little interest in importing. As Chinese mills have foreign wheat arriving that they contracted for themselves, they are not urgently in need. Therefore, the market saw no major developments. It is heard that Japanese and Chinese mills each took in two to three thousand bags of wheat, and the selling price was slightly firmer than before.</p>
<p>A large amount of foreign wheat continuously arrives in Shanghai. The Norwegian vessel Vito, managed by 天祥洋行, arrived from Australia with over 8,000 tons last Tuesday (the 17th), berthed at buoys 14 and 15 for unloading. It is expected to be cleared today. Yesterday, the firm's Astorla, also from Australia with over 8,000 bags, arrived in Shanghai at around 5 p.m., berthed at buoy 809, and unloading will begin today. The two ships carry a total of 17,000 tons. (祖)</p>
<h3>Securities: French Indochina Yields to Japan; Foreign Stock Prices Soar; Domestic Bonds Frequently See Increases</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter securities market continued its upward trend yesterday. However, it briefly declined slightly in the afternoon due to unfounded rumors, but overall sentiment remained very strong. Major players only increased their holdings, while retail investors often showed signs of cashing out, making the market very stable. In terms of news, economic and material assistance to China from Britain, America, and the Soviet Union is becoming more robust, and new routes for China's foreign transportation are being created. However, the biggest factor is still the pain of being unable to use the excessive floating capital, which has gone from abundant to overflowing. The reduction of bank deposit interest rates is a clear indication of this. A portion of this floating capital has already been invested in government bonds. The cultivation of this strength is sure to make the public bonds prosperous. Yesterday morning, the 25th issue was the most actively bought. Heng Fu and Run De also had quite strong demand. There were also many sporadic purchases from retail investors. Lian Yi and Yong Feng saw some profit-taking. Tong Kang sold first and then bought, and the market price at the midday close was bullish, fluctuating widely. The opening in the afternoon was very firm. The third installment once hit six yuan, but later, as retail investors rushed to sell and Lian Yi and Jiu Feng resumed profit-taking, the 25th issue was consistently bought. Tong Shun also saw heated demand for both the 丙戍 types. The market was relatively weaker in the afternoon, but the 戊 and 丁 types continued to strengthen, resulting in a continued increase of 23 to 55 cents. The total number of transactions was over $1.2 million. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 45 shares of the 中華書局 stock were traded at a price of $31.50 per share.</p>
<p>The stock market at the 衆業公所 opened yesterday and did not place much emphasis on the Japanese army's entry into Vietnam. Prices were remarkably stable. Later, because of the news that France and Japan had reached an agreement in Hanoi, buyers took the opportunity to engage in large-scale activity, and the prices of various stocks soared to new highs not seen in a long time. The vigor of the Xin He Cotton Mill shares benefited the entire market. The stock initially traded around $7.20 in the morning, and large quantities of orders came in, which were fully absorbed. It turned upward in the afternoon, closing at a high price of $8.45. Although rubber shares were not as vigorous as industrial shares, they were also remarkably firm. The total transaction volume of various stocks yesterday was the largest it had been in a long time.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Assembled Yarn Sales Continue Smoothly in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The yarn market situation is still rising, but although there is no shortage of new buyers, most transactions are based on the idea of scalping, so the situation is superficially very firm, but in reality, there is not much strength. Because prices are slightly higher, profits are quickly taken, and as soon as holdings loosen, the market quickly falls; conversely, it rises. However, currently, Hong Kong's demand is continuous, and all parties are strongly motivated. Around 1,000 bales are bought each day, but most of them are specified brands of yarn.</p>
<p>The morning opening of spot yarn was still benign. 20-count Double Horse opened at $1,013. A little later, scalpers rushed in, and because gold prices were high, it rose to $1,018. This price fluctuated for a long time. Because spot sales to Hong Kong were still 1,000 bales, and coarse yarn prices were very tight, the market price was firm, and the trading floor was very lively. The closing price was $1,016. Unexpectedly, gold prices suddenly fell after the close, and sentiment became slightly weak, falling by $6 or $7. The Double Horse price was $1,010. Statistics show that 2,685 bales were traded in half a day. The market for 10-count Double Horse was flat. Yesterday, 10 lots of cotton yarn were exported to Hong Kong, and 455 lots were shipped to Siam. Today, 955 lots are still being shipped to Hong Kong and 85 lots to Xiamen. The amounts bought by each trading group are listed below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 095, Other traders: 1580</p>
<p>Total: 2685</p>
<h3>Cotton Turns Upward, with Long-Staple Fiber Particularly Popular</h3>
<p>Although there are no batch transactions in the spot cotton business, market sentiment is tighter than before. This is because although the new cotton crop year is bountiful, the source is unreliable, so cotton merchants have a good attitude. However, the yarn market still lacks upward momentum, and factories are not absorbing high prices. Only trading among merchants is picking up, and selling prices have not changed much.</p>
<p>In other news, New York cotton prices initially fell due to a lack of major buyers and then because of good weather in cotton-growing areas, resulting in closing prices falling by 35 points compared to the previous day. Yesterday, India, including forecasts, was up around half a rupee.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, there is a current shortage of long-staple fiber spot goods in the market, but there are many inquiries for 32-count cotton yarn. Factories therefore intend to buy this raw cotton, so it has been very popular in recent days. The merchants are well aware that the arrival of raw cotton is becoming increasingly scarce, and their sentiments are firm, with a consensus that the cotton market will rise.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Yarn Prices Rise, Cloth Mill Quotes Increase</h3>
<p>National Cloth: Yesterday, the national cloth market benefited from the rising price of raw yarn, which affected costs, and the factory quotations gradually tightened. However, current sales still lack large-scale development, and sporadic transactions are still lively. Selling prices for coarse and fine cloth and twill cloth rose by 12 cents, while colored cloth and colored twill rose by 25 to 50 cents. Bleached cloth, printed cloth, and velvet cloth were flat. More than 500 pieces of various cloths were transacted on this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders transacted over 300 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, coarse cloth, and twill cloth. Zhejiang and Fujian traders transacted over 100 pieces of colored twill and coarse cloth, and northern traders from Yantai and Qingdao transacted over 100 pieces of assembled cloth, velvet cloth, and woolen cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, dyeing and sales activities on this street were active, and selling prices continued to rise. Among the white goods, medium and lower-grade fine cloth and fine twill suddenly rose by 50 to 75 cents per piece. Abe &amp; Co. set the price for 12-pound Yang He fine cloth at $28 per piece. The price of Dragon Head fine cloth in the morning market softened due to the decline in gold prices, falling to $32.75. Later, the market rose to $32.90 due to good prices for medium-grade goods. Four Gentlemen Serge was 94 cents, while the Zhigong允缺佾 was already being quoted at over $1 per yard.</p>
<p>Exports: A check of the piece goods shipped to other ports shows that 105 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong on the 13th, and another 140 pieces were shipped to Siam. Today, there are also 245 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 405 pieces to Hong Kong, and 41 pieces to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fluctuate Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable, with both increases and decreases, but the amounts were not large. The 公會's quoted price for spot goods in the 24 group white stock was $80.05, up one cent. Old goods were $78.50, new foreign stock was $80, and transshipment goods were soft at $64. Dutch cotton white TML mark was $77.20, down one cent; KD mark was $76. Dutch red was initially $62.90 to $63, and later $63.30. Tai Ku car white B mark was $77.50, down five cents; DY mark was $75 to $75.50, up five cents; HX mark was $75 to $75.40, up four cents. Our factory's 晶明 rock sugar was $99, up $1.50. On the 23rd, 120 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong, and 200 bags from Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cake: Speculation in Edible Oil Focuses on Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market was mediocre, and the source was still connected. Spot oil sales were not smooth, but most players are focused on futures speculation, so the market is slightly tighter in the later stages. A total of 110 lots of Jiaozhou soybean oil were opened at a price of $73. 50 lots of Yantai soybean oil were priced at $75.9. 600担 of Dalian pure soybean oil were priced at $80. 300 担 of Da You Factory soybean oil were priced at $81 to $81.50. 250 lots of Jiaozhou raw oil were priced at $67.50 to $68.50. 200 lots of road goods were priced at $67.75. 800 lots for October delivery were priced at $67.50 to $68.75. 900 lots for late October delivery were priced at $68.75 to $70. 50 lots of Yantai raw oil were $67. 130 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were priced at $94.50 to $95.</p>
<p>On the 24th, miscellaneous grains were exported, with 568 bags of beans shipped to Xiamen, 120 bags to Hong Kong, and 40 bags to Singapore. In addition, 2,480 pieces of bean cake were shipped to Singapore, 200 pieces of raw oil were shipped to Xiamen, and 700 cans were shipped to Hong Kong. On the 23rd, 700 pieces of bean cake were shipped to Siam.</p>
<p>Correction: Yesterday's newspaper incorrectly printed the asking price for ship steel plates at one point as $50, when it should have been $60. This is hereby corrected.</p>

<h3>The Pitiful Old Prisoner</h3>
<p>— Ji Cao</p>
<p>When I was in eastern Zhejiang, I lived at my friend Lawyer Zhang's house. Because I often went with him to the court to observe, I learned quite a few legal stories. One day, I saw an old prisoner attempting to escape from prison. In his "unfortunate fate," his father was caught by the police; now, he was being forced by his father to let the judge add a charge of "fugitive" to his crimes.</p>
<p>The scene was truly unbearable to witness. Who could have guessed what crime that pitiful old prisoner had committed? His hair was almost completely white, deep wrinkles ran across his forehead, his eyes were so vacant, and his entire weak and frail body trembled. He scanned his surroundings with pleading eyes, and anyone would have been willing to return a sympathetic look of pity.</p>
<p>Now, the esteemed person sitting on the high platform began the interrogation:</p>
<p>"Why? Why? Tell me, why did you try to escape from prison?"</p>
<p>The pitiful old prisoner could only manage to tremble. Though his lips seemed to move slightly, no one could hear his answer, and of course, the judge was no exception.</p>
<p>"Do you know that you are now subject to two legal penalties? First, you committed murder; second, you committed attempted prison escape. Can you tell me if you are dissatisfied with the penalties the law has given you?"</p>
<p>The old prisoner still did not answer. He now felt he had lost all hope and simply hung his head. The judge seemed moved by the scene and did not scold the old prisoner as he would other criminals. He simply gazed at the old prisoner with a compassionate and pitying look. After about three minutes, he turned to my friend Lawyer Zhang and said:</p>
<p>"Now, the appointed defense counsel can make a statement! The poor old man no longer has the strength to speak."</p>
<p>My friend stood up solemnly.</p>
<p>"This lawyer hopes that the court can allow the defendant to return home once. The reason the defendant attempted to escape was because he could not bear to leave behind a young grandson at home. This request was previously brought up by this lawyer but was rejected by the court due to the seriousness of the case, leading to this escape attempt. Therefore, this lawyer still hopes that the court will allow the defendant to return home once. If he attempts to flee, this lawyer is willing to bear all responsibility. As for the legal penalties, this lawyer has no objection."</p>
<p>The old prisoner seemed to hear my friend's words. He slowly raised his head, again with pleading eyes, looking at the esteemed judge above, as if waiting for the judge's pity.</p>
<p>Now the old prisoner had his wish fulfilled. His pitiful situation had also moved the judge, who had specially allowed him to return home once; however, he was given a deadline of two days. My friend was also willing to help him. He gave the old prisoner five yuan and also hired a black awning boat for the old prisoner, sending him onto the boat. The boatman pushed the oar with his foot, and the boat cut through the water, flying away.</p>
<p>My friend and I watched the distant silhouette of the departing black awning boat, both of us controlled by emotion, speechless, watching the boat go further and further away, disappearing behind the mountains.</p>
<p>"Shi, do you also think this old prisoner is pitiful?" my friend turned to me and said;</p>
<p>"Yes, he is truly pitiful!" We slowly walked back home: "But I don't believe he committed murder. What kind of thing is murder?"</p>
<p>"Alas!" My friend sighed deeply and said: "How can it not be? Who can believe that this old man would have the heart to kill someone? This matter is truly tragic."</p>
<p>My friend paused, and continued: "Initially, this old man was a lonely old man. He had a married daughter who suffered the tragedy of losing her husband; his daughter, for the sake of livelihood, had no choice but to leave her two children with this pitiful old man, and went to Shanghai alone to find work. Originally, this old man lived by begging; now, suddenly adding two young grandchildren, they often went hungry. They managed to get through two months like this. Now, the whole county is experiencing a rice shortage, and one yuan can only buy a little over two sheng of rice. Sometimes, even with money, there is nowhere to exchange for rice. No one is willing to give away their pearl-like rice to the poor. Therefore, this pitiful old man and his two grandchildren often went hungry for several days. The children don't understand, and when they are hungry, they make a fuss with their grandfather. Forced by this, one morning, he held one of his grandchildren</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 7: "Take Him Away"</p>
<p>The light inside was not very bright, and I couldn't see much. As I straightened up, I suddenly heard a faint footstep on the carpet. Looking back, I saw a woman walking from the west. I casually turned around, walked back, and brushed past the woman. Her eyes were looking at the room numbers, clearly not paying attention to me. I looked back and saw her enter room 554. When I returned to the entrance of the corridor, I saw A-Gen from room 71 in a close conversation with another short waiter. A-Gen also saw me but didn't greet me, only shook his head slightly. I knew that was the signal that Zhao Boxiong wasn't inside. That short waiter from room 54 must be Little Li. He also glanced at me, clearly A-Gen had introduced me to him.</p>
<p>When I returned to the stairwell, Hawthorne was coming down from the sixth floor. I also shook my head at him. Hawthorne, seeing that there was no one around, whispered to me.</p>
<p>"It's good that he's not in the room. I want to go in and take a look first. But you don't need to come in. It's best to find a suitable place to wait. In case he suddenly returns, we two can respond from inside and outside."</p>
<p>I agreed. Hawthorne walked to the two waiters. A-Gen, seeing Hawthorne, shook his head again as before, then turned towards the stairwell. Hawthorne whispered something in Little Li's ear, and Little Li followed us. Hawthorne looked at the room numbers along the way, and when he reached the second turn, he nudged me with his mouth. I immediately stopped, letting Little Li go ahead with Hawthorne. This location was the only way to reach room 556. Not far from this turn, there was a window. I leaned against this window. I felt this location wasn't very convenient. If I stood still, people would easily become suspicious. But I couldn't choose a more suitable position.</p>
<p>After a while, Little Li returned. He had opened room 556 for Hawthorne and retreated alone. I walked to the turn and saw that Hawthorne had indeed gone in, and the door was closed. But when I looked back again, I saw someone in the distance swaying towards us from the first turn of the corridor. The person was still far away, and although I couldn't see clearly, I estimated his silhouette to be Zhao Boxiong. (116) , and threw himself into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, a passerby saw it and rescued the old man; at first, no one noticed that there was a small child who hadn't been rescued until the old man woke up and cried out for his grandson. Only then did they retrieve the child's body from the river. That's how the old man committed murder and was imprisoned. Now, his attempt to escape was because he couldn't bear to leave his other grandson at home; unfortunately, he also incurred a charge of being a fugitive. Alas! Truly tragic."</p>
<p>"Truly tragic!" I was deeply moved by this tragic story, and so was my friend. We walked in silence.</p>
<p>Self-Cultivation</p>
<h3>Blind Worship</h3>
<p>— Liu Jiagan</p>
<p>We often hear people quoting the words of ancient famous people and sages to criticize others, to overturn their theories and implement their own views. If others resist even slightly, they will loudly scold: "Hey! This is what the ancients said!" In this way, others may retreat in silence, but they have not considered whether the words of the ancients are still suitable for reality, whether they have far deviated from or distorted everything reflected by this forward-moving era. They only think that the words of the ancients are all "golden rules" and are definitely not wrong. This kind of worship is blind. They forget that before worship, they must add a modern critical perspective. The era is constantly advancing, and there is no reason why the thoughts of the ancients thousands of years ago can be completely applied to reality.</p>
<h3>Unable to Multitask and Unable to Live</h3>
<p>— Written by Yan Fan</p>
<p>Let's take an example: there is a gentleman who, whenever he sees someone napping during the day, shakes his head and sighs: "Rotten wood cannot be carved." The reason is that Confucius once said this, so of course, all those who nap during the day are "rotten wood" and "walls of dung." He doesn't know that the medical community has proven that short daytime naps are sufficient to restore physical fatigue, and many important people who are constantly burdened with mental and physical labor have this habit. In this way, rotten wood is no longer "rotten," and walls are no longer in the category of "dung."</p>
<p>We cannot blindly worship the words and deeds of the ancients unless we have examined them first. Here, I also need to quote a sentence from an ancient person. Roger Bacon in the thirteenth century said: "People should not blindly follow after Aristotle, but need to accumulate experience for themselves." Another Bacon (Francis Bacon), in the seventeenth century, also said: "One cannot say that something is right simply because someone else has said it before; one must rely on one's own eyes to observe whether it is so." From this, it can be seen that blind worship was already disdained by the ancients and is not a "product" that only exists in modern times!</p>
<p>Therefore, we should not only blindly worship the words and thoughts of the ancients, but we need to add a new and powerful critical perspective. We should retain the valuable things that cater to the times and continue to worship and praise them. As for some corrupt, outdated, and erroneous ideas, we will abandon them without hesitation! Friends, you should know that the era of blind conservatism is no longer here.</p>
<h3>Fine</h3>
<p>— Translated by Su Fu</p>
<p>Once, a pickpocket was caught in the act of stealing. The police took him to court, and the judge's verdict was a fine of fifty yuan.</p>
<p>However, the police searched the pickpocket and found only thirty yuan in total. So the police said to the judge: "He cannot pay so much of a fine. Can it be reduced to a fine of thirty yuan?"</p>
<p>The judge replied to the police: "Then you should release the pickpocket and let him go to the busy street. You follow him from behind, don't let him slip away. Bring him back in an hour. The fine of fifty yuan is not reducible."</p>

<h3>Characteristics of Shanghai Cinemas</h3>
<p>— Luo Cun</p>
<p>Shanghai cinemas all have their own characteristics. The twenty-two listed here can be compared, but this is a subjective opinion.</p>
<p>(1) Grand Cathay has "translated meaning style," which is its only unique feature.</p>
<p>(2) Nanjing Hollywood handles all the imported racy films in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(3) Cathay has specially assigned police officers to direct traffic when the show ends, and Mears Road is closed to all vehicles in the middle section.</p>
<p>(4) The Grand Shanghai is in charge of re-releasing blockbusters.</p>
<p>(5) The pageboys employed at the entrance and exit of Dahua are the smallest among Shanghai cinemas but provide the most loyal service.</p>
<p>(6) The height difference between the front and back rows of seats in the Huguang downstairs is its biggest feature.</p>
<p>(7) The lighting installation in the entire Jincheng cinema is in rectangular glass boxes, which is quite unique.</p>
<p>(8) There are two ticket entrances in the main hall of Xinguang. All others only have one.</p>
<p>(9) The arrangement of seats in the main hall of Lido is staggered, so every seat does not obstruct the audience's view.</p>
<p>(10) The upper and lower seats of Guanglu are all leather cushions, which can be called aristocratic.</p>
<p>(11) At Jinmen, after each screening of advertisement slides, a reporter reports on the next film, which is also a unique feature.</p>
<p>(12) The main hall seats in Paris are divided into rattan cushions and leather cushions, which are very comfortable.</p>
<p>(13) The shape of the entire Central cinema is like a fan.</p>
<p>(14) The entrance and exit of Ping An have no doors and are open day and night. If there is a crowd, there is no way to "pull down the iron gate."</p>
<p>(15) The entrances to all the Dumei cinemas are located behind the cinema, but Dumei's is located in the middle.</p>
<p>(16) The screen of the Lafayette cinema is the largest in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(17) There is no cinema in Shanghai with lighting darker than Zhejiang's.</p>
<p>(18) Before the show starts at Amon (during the day), there is not a single electric light on in the cinema. It relies entirely on natural sunlight from outside, which is extremely economical.</p>
<p>(19) The balcony of Mingxing is semicircular, which is not found in other cinemas.</p>
<p>(20) At the beginning of the show at Xihai, a person always appears in front of the screen to pull the curtain.</p>
<p>(21) The balcony of Jiuxing is extremely low. You can't find another one like it anywhere in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(22) The balcony seats in Shanxi are very small but very clean.</p>
<p>In addition, the Empire, Carde, Carlton, and the newly reorganized open-air cinema are not purely showing movies. Sometimes they also perform Peking opera and Yue opera, so they are not included.</p>
<h3>Island Theater Talk</h3>
<p>— Wei Wei</p>
<p>Li Shengzao, Tong Zhiling, and their group of actors will stop on Double Ten Day. As for the team following Li Shengzao, it was previously said to be Xin Yanqiu, Li Hezeng, Yu Zhenfei, Ru Fulan, and Hou Xirui, but after the reporter inquired with Golden, there have been some small changes. Li Hezeng, the male performer originally scheduled to be invited, has now been replaced by Zhou Xiaotian·Wei Wei·. At the same time, Hou Xirui, the famous Jing performer whom the audience has been eagerly awaiting, has reportedly cancelled his trip to Shanghai.</p>
<p>There is a small reason for Hou Xirui's cancellation. Because Xirui's expenses and package fees are high, and Xin Yanqiu's plays don't require Xirui in many places. If Xirui is asked to sing a solo performance every day, time would not allow it, and there would also be problems with the play schedule. In addition, Yu Zhenfei was "invited firmly with friendship," and Yu Zhenfei is giving Golden face and not counting package fees. Because of this relationship, it is planned to put Yu Zhenfei in the third position and martial artist Ru Fulan in the fourth position. If Xirui is put in the fifth position, it would not be appropriate. Therefore, for various reasons, Golden has given up on Xirui for the next lineup and plans to invite him and his old partner Zhou Ruian to come together after Xin Yanqiu. The Jing role will then be filled by Qiu Shengrong. The major comic roles will still be Sun Shengwu, and Guan Shengxi will also continue. As for martial artist Ru Fulan, the official matter has been settled, and he is scheduled to come south with Xin Yanqiu. Ru Fulan's masterpieces, "Exploring the Village," "Night Flight," and "Eight Great Hammers," have long been known to people in Shanghai and will surely be a big draw. Coupled with Xin Yanqiu and Yu Zhenfei's collaborative plays, it is expected that the performances will be a grand occasion.</p>
<h3>Film World Jottings</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Olivia de Havilland and James Stewart will soon have good news to announce. Regarding her sister Joan Fontaine, everyone unanimously predicts that she will become a red star on the silver screen in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Deanna Durbin recently received several interesting letters from Japan, requesting her not to kiss any men in her starring films in the future.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, Hollywood's overseas markets have disappeared by forty percent. Now, the only remaining countries are in South America. For this reason, film merchants have decided to produce several films featuring South American heroes such as Simon Bolivar in this year's filming plan.</p>
<p>We all know that Shirley Temple's departure from the silver screen is because she wants to go to school. However, there is another rumor in the film city recently, saying that it is because she and her parents are not satisfied with the content of the scripts that the company assigns her to star in.</p>
<p>This autumn is the time for the US presidential election, and the entire film city is unfolding a lively situation for this event. It is said that a large number of film stars support Roosevelt's re-election.</p>
<p>Marlene Dietrich was recently selected by an American magazine as the most beautiful woman on the silver screen, while Glan Ziaren was selected by psychology students at a certain university as the female star most suitable for starring in Western films.</p>
<h3>The Kissing Art of Male and Female Stars—One of the Silver Screen Kiss Talks—</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>Regarding kissing on the silver screen, this magazine has had several reports. In the eyes of people in Hollywood, kissing is also an important art when filming. What this article wants to say is the kissing techniques of several major male and female stars in Hollywood.</p>
<p>(1) Male Stars</p>
<p>When Gary Cooper kisses female stars, he seems crazy in some films. Sometimes he kisses very sincerely, able to concentrate on his work and do it as if it were a real thing.</p>
<p>Jack Oakie kisses the lightest among the male stars in Hollywood, almost making the female star unaware that she is kissing.</p>
<p>George Raft is the complete opposite of Jack Oakie. His kisses are the heaviest. Several female stars don't like to kiss him.</p>
<p>William Powell lets every female star in Hollywood know how sweet it is to kiss him.</p>
<p>(2) Female Stars</p>
<p>Mae West is the most passionate when kissing on the silver screen. When she kisses, her head seems to be placed on the man's body, without gaps or turns, and she doesn't kiss like a flyover. There are no shortcomings that can be pointed out.</p>
<p>Jean Harlow only uses a part of her lips when she kisses, which is very gentle. But her kissing scenes often have to be reshot.</p>
<p>When Joan Crawford kisses, her head moves, and she smears her lipstick on the man's lips from right to left.</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert's kisses are full of flirtatious colors. There is no fixed method, and the male star who kisses her is almost anesthetized.</p>
<h3>Jindu Grand Theatre Opens on Christmas Day</h3>
<p>Jindu Grand Theatre was founded by the Liu brothers and others. It was originally scheduled to open at the same time as Guolian after the Mid-Autumn Festival, but because the work started later and the project was huge, it is now under construction. It is rumored that it will open on Double Ten Day, but this may not be possible. The reporter received reliable news from related parties that the theater wants to make it the ideal cinema, so it must be postponed until Christmas to officially open.</p>
<h3>Introducing the US Navy Band</h3>
<p>— Xu Wu Huan</p>
<p>The US Navy Band has been in Shanghai for six years. Every Sunday, they hold concerts at the Grand Cathay Theatre, sharing their superb skills with the Chinese people, "to introduce art and to connect feelings." The bandleader, Mr. Giffin (L.E. Giffin), and the band conductor, Mr. Rauhof (J.P. Rauhof), are both outstanding musicians who have a good impression of the Chinese people. Although the program of their concerts is determined by them, they are quite willing to accept external requests. If Chinese people want to ask them to play a certain piece, they can send a letter in advance, stating the name of the piece and the author, and they will definitely play it within the possible range. Moreover, the concert does not sell tickets. Those who love noble art are invited to listen quietly at the Grand Cathay Theatre before 10:00 am every Sunday.</p>
<p>The team is full of talent and has recently been greatly expanded. The number of members has increased to thirty-nine. The attached picture shows their new lineup.</p>
<p>(The person sitting in the middle of the front row in the attached picture: Mr. Giffin on the right, Mr. Rauhof on the left.)</p>
