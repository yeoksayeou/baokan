<h3>日本的掙扎</h3>
<p>中日之間發生問題，有六十餘年的歷史，自從滿淸末葉到抗戰前夕，幾乎每一種解決的方式都經嘗試過，而其發展的結果，則適足證明兩國間戰爭無可避免；而且也只有從事澈底的戰爭，纔是澈底解決中日問題的唯一途徑。所以這一抗戰局面，也許被人看成是一種不幸，其實到是歷史的必然。</p>
<p>遠東的成爲問題，一方在於中國往年的積弱不振，別方則因日本併吞中國獨覇東亞的野心。自從日本率先變法維新，幾十年米，一貫的視中國爲彼擴展的對象。西鄉隆盛的征韓論，大隈的二十一條，田中的奏章，「九一八」以來日閥的種種措置和行動，無一不是把中國當做刀俎上的魚肉看待。甚至直到兩月以前披露的日汪文件，還是表示着日閥侵華亡華的迷夢並未覺醒。日閥如此野心，一天不加全盤淸算，則東方安得和平，甚至於全世界必無眞正和平可言。所以中國的抗戰，從任何角度來看，都有必須澈底完成其客觀使命的必要，這也就是中國對於東方以至於全世界所負一種的重大義務。</p>
<p>至於中國往年的積弱，原是無可諱飾的事實：不幸在革命建設的中途，一切纔見曙光而橫遭侵略，到了現在，却已完全改觀；無疑的，這是抗戰中的重要副收穫。政治軍事力面的統一和進步不必說了，即如國際聲譽的增高，民族品性的洗鍊，都不是在平時所能一蹴而　的事。餘如交通建設，經濟開發，內地社會的進步，邊省文化的提高，無不事實昭然，爲人所共睹。尤其値得寳貴的，是從兩年餘的這種艱苦努力當中，已鍛鍊出來一種堅强信心和果敢毅力，表現着中華國魂的昭蘇，民族靑春的復活。凡此抗戰中間的成就、不是任何誣衊所能抹殺的。任何古老的國家，往往因爲歷史留傳下來的渣滓在社會中積纍得太多，致使民族形成病態，甚至予人以衰老的觀感；在這種情形之下。除舊布新，往往此之草創還要艱難數倍。但是一旦從事於對外的民族戰爭，則非一敗塗地，土崩瓦解，即得在極短期間收穫突飛猛進的功效，這也是古今史蹟所數見不鮮；如德意志的統一，義大利的獨立，土耳其的復興，都是明顯例證。這一次中國對外需要民族戰爭，第一步的成功在於粉碎了對方速戰速決的戰略，亦即第一步渡過了一敗塗地，土崩瓦解的危機；從此而後，轉變而入於突飛猛進的機運了；德義土諸國的光輝壯烈固是先例，而在中國歷史則是空前的奇績。是因爲中國積弱而引起了的中日戰爭，同時却因爲了這一次戰爭的磨鍊而使中國轉弱爲强。在戰事中間中國確是蒙受了重大的損害，然而亦因爲了戰事而得到了更大的收穫。</p>
<p>任何人都相信中國絕不是個黷武的民族，中國而從事戰爭，則此一戰爭必屬萬萬無可避免；申言之，中國若非萬不得已，決不抗戰，非到最後關頭，決不抗戰。抗戰絕不是赴死，而是爲了求生；所以當抗戰爆發之初，對於前途的展望即曾有過明確的估計；即曾下了持久抗戰與忍痛犧牲的決心。到今天檢點兩年餘的血的經騐，適足證明當時那種估計的睿智賢明，並與事實上的推衍若合符節。現朴縱還不到把日軍趕出中國的階段，却已獲得了充分的自信和把握。而且在長斯相持當中，日軍實已勢衰力竭，軍民厭戰，其轉而加緊政治攻勢，正可見其已失却軍事上的信心。縱觀年餘以來，日軍一敗於鄂中，再潰於湘北，晋西晋南的混戰，賓陽粵北的敗衂，都證明了日軍實力的衰頹，進犯企圖的失敗，其間雖亦曾經在南昌潮汕和欽防邕寗倖獲一逞，究未能絲毫挽救其全盤戰局之支絀。連日適在日方政治攻勢孤注一擲，倒行逆施的關頭，桂南綏西的戰塲又傳來克復靈山五原的捷音，恰好像對於那一攻勢的當頭棒喝。最近各綫日軍調動頻繁，殆又將以其最後挣扎與其政治攻勢相呼應，然而只要中國軍民史堅定更振奮，則日方新的軍事佈置亦必與其政治攻勢同陷其自身於進退失據的窘境。絕無疑問的，中國抗戰前途，絕不因此遭受任何影響。</p>
<p>中國的解放和進步，東亞的安定與和平，都只有從抗戰的勝利當中纔能取得，除此而外，、何辦法和方案都只有增加混亂和紛擾，這是歷史注定的命運，同時也是世人所最應認淸　的一點。</p>

<h3>德義共同政策　維持巴爾幹和平　義不容外力伸入南斯拉夫　德圖改造東南歐經濟機構</h3>
<p>巴黎　匈牙利總理戴勒基正作羅馬之遊、此間政界人士頃加以評論云、東南歐洲局勢若是、戴勒基總理此行意義、自異常重大、但歐洲局勢自匈外長查基在數閱月前訪晤義外長齊亞諾以還、業已大變、緣齊亞諾外長曾經提供諾言、聲明匈國若果遭受蘇聯攻擊、義國即當出而加以援助、但以匈國與羅馬尼亞相接近、并暫時放棄修正邊境要求為條件、其時蘇芬戰事正在相持中、齊亞諾作此諾言、可謂適合時宜、迨至德元首希特勒與義首相墨索里尼日前在勃倫納山隘會見、并對東南歐洲局勢擬定共同政策之後、多瑙河流域暨巴爾幹半島、似將由德義蘇三國共同予以「保護」、但義國旣決心防止現行戰事蔓延至於東南歐洲、則是否聽任蘇聯勢力侵入該處、尙不可知、戴勒基總理所當探詢義國當局者、此項問題、即其一端云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　眾院外交委員會副主席貝才、頃向「秩序報」發表一文、評論東南歐時局、其中扼要之語、乃謂「南斯拉夫對於義國之重要、與捷克斯拉夫之於德國相同、義相墨索里尼之不願他國勢力伸入南國、自屬意料中事」云、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間各報頃載有巴爾幹半島各國京城來電稱、德國現正推動廣大計畫、欲將東南歐洲各國全部經濟機構予以改組、要求各該國裁減一部份軍備、減少工業生產、從而提高農產品數量、以之接濟德國、并聞已為各該國分別擬有精密生產計畫、內容至為詳盡、此在英法兩國定必迅速予以應付、至義大利之態度如何、亦復值得注意云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑞士巴塞爾城　此間各報頃接獲中歐方面消息、藉悉德國提議由德義蘇三國向巴爾幹半島各國共同提供保障一項計劃、業已遭遇困難、據巴塞爾城新聞報載稱、巴爾幹半島關係各國因德國并未向之懲詢意見、故對於此項計劃、匪特未予歡迎、抑且表示懷疑、南斯拉夫外交界人士并以為該國與蘇聯并無外交關係、茍非義國以強大壓力相加、則該國能否接受蘇聯之保障、實屬疑問、要而言之、巴爾幹半島各國咸以為德國所提出之保障計畫、恐不易成功、揣其用意、殆欲促令蘇聯在巴爾幹半島方面推行較為審慎之政策、亦未可知云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>匈牙利外交政策　避免牽入戰渦　暫時不提修約要求　匈揆明日謁見義相</h3>
<p>羅馬　昨日此間相信、匈牙利總理戴勒基將於下星期　與墨索里尼首相及外長齊亞諾舉行會談、（二十四日合眾電）</p>

<p>羅馬　此間政界人士以為匈總理戴勒基之訪問羅馬、已證實希特勒與墨索里尼在勃倫納山隘會晤後之一般印象、即義國以為匈牙利之修改和約派之要求、目前尚無討論之機會、「講壇報」載稱、匈牙利深知在目前之情勢下、不容提出特殊要求、擾亂巴爾幹半島及多瑙河流域之和平、「義大利日報」載稱、匈國總理與義國當局會晤後、必有以增進匈國與斯洛伐克南斯拉夫蘇聯及羅馬尼亞等國之友好關係、匈牙利并不放棄其權利、亦不亟亟於實現其目的、但等待適當之時機而已、匈牙利之外交政策、為避免牽入戰爭漩渦、而與義國合作、藉以維持東南歐之和平云、（二十四日海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　德國外交部喉舌「德意志外交政治通訊報」宣稱、匈牙利總理戴勒基訪問義國、不致發生驚人結果、保持友好關係之國家自應密切接觸、而於嚴重時期尤有保持接觸之必要、軸心國家之領袖最近已舉行會談、與軸心國家維持友好關係之國家與義當局討論多瑙河問題、亦為當務之急、東南歐幸免擾動、由於各國當局之敏銳見解與負責精神、然某種問題尙待解決、以免各國利用列強之紛爭而有所企圖、協約國頗有煽動東南歐各國擾亂意向、而匈牙利等東南歐國家均拒絕此項誘惑、而表現其政治家之遠見、東南歐各國必須避免牽入戰爭漩渦、德義兩國密切注視東南歐之幸福、必竭力維持東南歐之和平云、（二十四日海通電）</p>
<h3>教皇嚴詞譴責　國際侵略暴行　背信滅理言之痛心　祈求上帝早復和平</h3>
<p>梵蒂岡　教皇庇護十二世頃在聖彼得大教堂向教徒講道、對於侵犯公理與破壞條約之舉動、以及無節制的征略慾望、加以譴責、其言有云、「吾人所處為何種時代、當為汝輩所諗知、各民族之協和業已破裂、鄭重簽訂之條約已被片面修改或被破壞、種種事物凡有裨於各民族之繁榮與進步者、均已不循常軌、甚至各文明民族相互關係所依據之公理亦被侵犯、例如不設防務之城市與農人所眾居之村鎮、往往為飛機所轟炸、居民震駭、盧舍被燬、田地受損、一般無自衛能力之平民與夫老弱癟病者或遭炸斃、或流離奔走、無家可歸、」言之實屬痛心、余茲虔禱上帝、務使各國君主宗室與人克享和平、并能協和一致云、（二十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>北歐同盟　難成事實　因蘇德均表反對</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯報紙評論瑞典挪威與芬蘭三國簽訂防守同盟之計劃、以為蘇芬和約已使協約國在北歐煽動戰爭之企圖全部失敗、北歐各國業已處於戰區以外、協約國方面自有不能甘心之意、蘇聯努力實現和平及北歐各國之互相合作之關係、而所謂「防守同盟」之真正背景、實為建立反蘇陣綫云、（二十四日海通電）</p>
<p>倫敦　此間消息靈通人士頃談稱、芬蘭挪威瑞典三國成立防禦同盟條約之議、恐已不易成為事實、緣蘇聯方面對於此隘、旣已表示反對、而德國又復出以同樣態度、瑞典政府深恐因此引起糾紛、是以猶疑不決、依德蘇兩國所見、此項同盟條約倘能具有反英法之意味、從而使各該國勢力今後無法伸入北歐各國、同時更使與瑞典兩國之貿易數量愈見增加、則德蘇兩國當可加以贊助、無如按之實際斯堪的那維亞半島各國之所出欲訂此條約、正擬作為自衛之工具、適與德蘇兩國所抱意願相反、則其表示反對、自屬意料中事、挪威瑞典兩國有鑒於此、寗願對於各交戰國出以較為含蓄的態度、而不欲訂立條約以招致後患、職是之故、北歐三國成立防禦盟約之議、甚難見諸事實云、（二士三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>阿姆斯特丹　直布羅陀英當局檢查義郵船「薩伏亞伯爵」號之旅客、外界認為英國封鎖措施較前益加嚴厲、因此次義船、乃係開往外埠、前此所檢查者均為由外埠開回義大利之輪船、其主要之目的、為擄去在軍事服務年齡之德國人、并無涉及旅客全體之用意、由中立者之立場觀察、在中立國輪船內搜查旅客、猶英國當局在中立國領土內執行警權云、（二十四日海通社電）</p>

<p>蘇聯與歐戰</p>
<h3>前捷克參謀部莫刺維克上校撰</h3>
<p>海通社航訊　就軍務情勢親察、此屆歐戰與前次歐戰完全不同、帝俄為英法協商之與國、一九一四年迄一九一七年間、德國須以五分之二兵力、留於東方戰場、在帝俄敗潰之前、德國祗有五分之三兵力、與英法聯軍週旋、德國與帝俄作戰三年之結果、德軍傷亡被俘者在百萬人以上、而去年德波戰役、歷時不過一月、傷亡纔一萬四千人、當一九一八年三月德軍由阿密安進攻時、德軍有四十師、約當軍力總額六分之一、仍留俄境、而今則德軍長官無須在東方留駐大軍、更無須留空軍砲軍駐防、為維持波蘭治安計、祗須警察及保安隊已足勝任、今日之蘇聯、不惟對德無惡意、且以食糧燃料及礦產相資助焉、抑有一於此者、蘇聯不必出兵援德、祗須對英法利害攸關之地、如伊拉克·巴基斯坦、及敘利亞等處施以壓力、已可見效、況蘇聯與帕米爾高原望衡對宇、通達英屬印度之要隘、蘇聯可望復可即乎、前次歐戰英法得帝俄為與國、可調遣印度菲洲及澳洲之軍隊以攻土耳其、同時帝俄亦可由北向南壓迫土耳其、於是蘇彝士運河及波斯海灣之入口、亦不致感受威脋、設若波希米亞盆地可稱為歐洲之中心、則位於五海間之區域、可稱為古代世界之中心、五海者、黑海裏海·愛情海·紅海·及阿剌伯海是也、今日之土耳其·伊拉克·敘利亞·巴基斯坦·阿剌伯及伊朗之北部、則位於五海間之區域、英國在此區內、不但擁有富饒之油田、其通達歐亞菲澳四大洲之航空線亦復以此為樞紐、在此地帶、英國若喪失威勢、則大英帝國之國祚不永、甚目厄運之臨、可計日而待焉、再者德國今日祗有一條戰線、儘可集中全力於萊茵河一帶、而英法兩國則須顧及歐洲以外之殖民地與海軍根據地之安全、心勞力拙、岌岌堪危、法國旣須駐軍都尼斯以防義大利、復須駐軍摩洛哥以防西班牙、更須留駐人　於敘利亞、以增強土耳其抗禦蘇聯之實力、然則法國不能如昔年之調動殖民地之兵士赴歐助戰矣、英國今日遭遇之窘、亦與法國相似、印度方面祗能調動極少數之軍隊、而伊拉克與巴基斯坦之堡壘均需增防、一九一五年帝俄之騎兵已飲馬底格里斯河、彼時德俄為歇、俄軍須以六分之五軍力防護德俄邊境、商今兩國化敵為友顧忌全無、蘇聯軍隊如若南下、北於何境、豈易言哉、法國人口稀少、此役若再喪失二百萬人、不復能雄據列強之位、法與德戰、需要英法兩國殖民地出兵相助、但因感受蘇·義·西三國之壓迫、殊難如願以償、於是不得不忍痛以馬奇諾戰綫之防務重資、完全加諸本國人子弟之肩頭、總之、蘇聯之善意中立、不僅使英國之封鎖政策歸於失敗、且使英法聯軍之實力難以集中、德國之觀察如是、識者當不河漢斯言也、（王善賞譯）</p>

<p>設固定崗</p>
<p>該「Ｂ」區開放缺口、原係公共租界工部局及英軍當局考慮、允准日本海軍陸戰隊之要求、但經聲明、有隨時封鎖之權、及雙方派軍警駐守之必要、茲據大光社記者探悉、租界當局、對於中央市塲」、雖許其請求開放、然對日僞行止、深致注意、頃爲確保該境治安、隔離僞「市塲」組織起見、爰於昨日起、授權警務處方面、飭即轉諭該管匯司捕房、特派中西巡捕五名、前往該「Ｂ」區缺口北面、特設固定崗位、並豎立一大型油傘、（與交叉馬路指揮交通崗位油傘相同）</p>

<h3>舊報新抄　六十七年前　見遜清同治十二年本報</h3>
<p>錢銀情形</p>
<p>古者日中爲市，以粟易器，以物易物，原無需乎貨財，故古時君相，亦無計及貨財之事。周之興也，，太公作九府之法，而交易始用貨財。及漢之報，又於錢刀泉帛之外，添鑄五銖之錢。又傳至宋，始改鑄各帝年號之錢。宋元以前事，始無具論，惟以明事論之：洪武年間，財用業已不敷，造用鈔票後，亦廢興屢矣，錢亦時鑄時停，故致崇禎之時，流寇四起而國用不支，因而創立各餉名目，逐年加賦，豈知賦出於農，農出於土，田不能種而惟情節是征，遂致民窮財盡，流爲賊而亡其宗社。明亡後，王公勳戚，仕官閣　，各家金銀一物，拱手而獻於賊營者，不能以千萬計，而銅錢尚不在甚貴重之列。當思宗措餉之時，而後父周奎首揆陳演等，助之於思宗者僅百金，獻之於　賊者則百萬。我朝定鼎之後，銀則日見其出，錢則日加其鑄，至雍乾時而銀庫全盈，銅錢充滿。至道光時不若前之繁富，此時雲南之銀鑛尚開，銀猶不至支絀，錢局之鼓鑄，制錢尚未多銷，故錢銀猶未至如今日之缺乏也。推源其故，大約銀則大半歸藏私家，否則即行流出外洋，鑄爲洋錢；故致上海市肆，雖爲天下最，若一日間令辦銀百萬兩，錢百萬串，恐亦不能齊集也。</p>

<h3>農業中國何以能操勝算？</h3>
<p>— 張肖梅</p>
<p>經濟要素的誤解</p>
<p>在高度技術化的現代戰爭之下，力能製造新兵器的工業國，似乎確比軍火仰給於輸入的農業國佔上風。因此有一批失敗主義者，對於中國「抗戰必勝，建國必成」的信念，一開始就有所懷疑。</p>
<p>假使他們的懷疑確屬「爲國操心」：那末他們的責任，只有盡力協助政府設法克服他們心理上所認爲困難的難題。如果因爲有失敗的恐懼，便去做通敵賣國的勾當：則其所謂懷疑，居心何在？也就可想而知１</p>
<p>姑不問其居心如何？如從學理上以至事實上來分析，那末兩年半來的抗戰，也儘够糾正這種失敗主義的理論。這種理論的根本錯誤，便在不瞭解「經濟要素」的具體內容。戰爭的經濟要素指什麽呢？有的說是指「人力，物力，財力而言」的所謂「三Ｍ中說，有的說是指生產力，尤其是軍需工業生產力而言。前者可謂「資源論」，後者可謂「工業論」。錯就錯在各執一端。</p>
<p>只有豐富的資源而並無生產力配合：正和只有高度的工業設備而並無相當的人力，原料等資源配合：同樣是一個不健全的戰爭經濟體。固無所謂資源豐富，或生產力高强，甚至所謂工業國，或農業國云云。要測定兩個交戰國家的經濟力，重要的應觀察敵方的生產力和資　力的配合關係，誰比誰密切而協調？如果只有豐富的資源，而並無相當的生產力配合，不過是貨棄於地，雖富無益。如果只有高度的工業設備，而並無適長的資源去配合，也不過是形同虛設，無能爲力。這理由是非常明顯的。</p>
<p>中日戰爭經濟體</p>
<p>正因爲如此，所以中國和日本，同樣是一個不健全的戰爭經濟體。只因中國是個農業國，便以爲不及工業國的日本佔優勢；道果然觀察錯誤。但只因中國地大物博，便認爲比資源貧乏的日本，佔有優勢；也屬似是實非的。事實是毌容諱言的；甲國和日本，同樣都是不健全的戰爭經濟體。中日戰爭的勝敗關鍵，就在這種不健全的　度，誰比誰高的一點上。</p>
<p>農業中國勝算的根據</p>
<p>先拿中國來講：我國擁有豐富的鑛產，可是沒有相當的生產設備，所以貸業於地，雖富無益。道果是莫大的缺憾。但我國的國民經濟，乃至整個的戰爭經濟，由於目前事實上的限制，尙建立於農業基礎之上。正因如此，問題乃在我國的農業資源力和農業生產力，究能相互配合到何種程度？如果只有地地而無人耕種，或只有人力而無土地可耕，問題當然嚴重了</p>
<p>然而我國正是不愧爲地大物博人力衆多的大農業國。土地和人口的部份淪陷，並未影響倒整個國民經濟的維持力。因爲他們的生產勞作並未廢棄，雖因戰爭關係，或有一時的停頓，但旋即恢復。淪陷區內的民衆和物資，雖被肆意蹂躪和掠奪，可是戰時貨運阻頓，反迫使若干地方的農村，自然回歸到昔日自給自足的狀態；而在貨運尙能通達的地方，則在高物價的在潮之下，反獲得了增益收入的可能。中國農民耐勞耐苦的儉樸美德，是著聞於世的。現在他們一方以儉樸來抵抗工業品高物價的壓迫；他方以勤勞來享受增益收入的可能。而且工業品和農產品的物價鋏形，事實上巳日漸縮小。平昔農村間的一切封建勢力，如高利貸和佃租等等的壓力，無形中都已鬆弛。若干農村間雖出現了日僞和歹徒的暴力壓迫，可是他們在逆來順受之外，更堅定了抗戰的意志。戰時最可實貴的便是國民經濟的能吾維持？如果大部份的人民在戰時不能維持其生活，或感受戰爭的影響趨於深刻，那末無論在軍事上如何順利？結果還是免不了全盤崩潰的。然而個佔全中國人口百分之八十五以上農民的經濟生活，旣可不成問題。因此在上海時都巿裏所看到的那些地主，小巿民，乃至薪給階級們的生活不安，雖亦應盡力設法改善，但不足以影響我整個戰時國民經濟之維持，巳屬顯而易見的。所以中國的這個抗戰經濟體，在工業方面雖不健全；在農業方面，却是健全無憾的。正因爲中國然根兒是晨業國，所以農業經濟便成爲抗戰經濟的基礎。農業的經濟體制旣屬據全無憾，因此中國抗戰上的　濟要業，是不成問題的了。</p>
<p>工業日本的有名無實</p>
<p>當然；這是從比較上來說的。假使工業日本的戰爭經濟體同樣健實的話，那末農業中國的戰爭地位確就相形見絀了。但事實上，日本的工業經濟體壓根兒是個絕不健全的體制。主要理由便在他們難祇有相當的工業設備，却沒有相當的資源去配合？然而工業經濟正是他們整個國民經濟乃至戰爭經濟的骨幹，工業經濟本身的危險，就是日本整個國民經濟以至戰時經濟的危殆。</p>
<p>先從理論上說：國內原料不足，可求之國外。像英國工業的原料，百分之百幾皆求之國外。他在上次歐戰中所以能維持，今决歐戰中大致亦可不成問題。這有二個理由：第一他擁有雄厚的輸入財力，同時還有廣大的海外殖民地原料可供吸收。第二他保有强大的海軍足以維持其海上交通之外，同時他在國際外交中的地位，多少總比敵人處於優越的方面。否則他雖有維持海上交通的能力，但中立國不同情他而拒絕供給以物質，也是沒有辦法的。可是道二個條件，日本完全沒有。他現在一味想靠掠奪中國淪陷區內的物資來巷自己接血。然而無條件的掠奪必須有武力做後盾：在他兵力不足的今日，欲作大規樓的掠奪，尙非假道於法幣不可。因此造成他對華巨額的出超。這於資源貧乏與外匯貧乏上的帮助也就受了限制。所以他現在又有限制對華輸出的計劃。這便是他不能靠掠奪中國物資以補救其物資不足的明證。這積資源力與生產力不配合的病態，無疑的正是日本戰爭經濟體的致命傷。</p>
<p>再就事實上來說：近年來日本政府的生產擴充計劃，可說已雷厲風行。根據他去春第七十四屆　會的決定，預計提高鐵鋼等生產二成乃至三倍，使生產價額平均增加七成半。所以在去年一年內，投下的新資本達五，三〇八百萬日元，較前年的三，九七六百萬日元，幾乎增加一倍弱。更値得注意的，因爲他國內勢力極度恐慌之故，所以連年把工時無情地延長。如果以昭和十二年七月的工時作百分，那末去年平和性產業的平均工時指數，七月份爲八五分，十月分爲九六分；軍需工廠的工時，則自七月的一二一分增至十一月的一三三分。工時雖此無情地延長，可是他的生產指數却反比例地激减。如於　和六，七，八年平均估百分，那末總指數從七月的一八一，八遞减爲九月的一五五·六；依日閥政府自己的解釋，是由於電氣，瓦斯等的生產因煤荒而激减所致；實則根本問題還是爲了原料荒和人力荒。日閱政府不自量力，只知道增擴生產力的重要，而不知道沒有資源的配合，生產設備的增擴只是浮沙積塔，徒然使工業界的原料荒益益露骨的尖銳化罷了。中國物價的暴漲不足爲奇，因爲尙未完成物價統制的機構所致。但在早已厲行物價統制之日本，而其物價的上漲却反與時俱進，這更足以顯現他國內物資恐慌的嚴重程度爲何如了？</p>
<h3>爲小投機者進一言</h3>
<p>— 曹振昭</p>
<p>物價漲落，視供求而定。供少物貴，需寡物賤；此自然這趨。如供求本相稱而物價無理上漲，是爲反常。癩結所在，由於環境之壓迫者十之三，由於強力之操縱者十這七。姑就上海一隅言之，戰後人口，較原有驟增一倍，，一切消費如米煤等日用必需品，按工部局工人生活指數所示，較戰前超出三倍半，縱使中外交通阻滯，運費高昂，亦不應懸殊若是。此良別有主因，而投機事業之勃與亦爲最大原因這一·一部份小資產或薪給階級，遑遑終日，或則唯恐資產有損，或則因所入不足維持其生活，於是紛起爭購外滙，囤積貸特，以爲非此不足以保全資產，增加收入。詎不知此種階級，於市塲情形，本巳隔膜，於最近形勢，允屬茫然。僅恃道聽塗說，一方旣豔羨他人之獲厚利，一方又欲謀資產之安全，忽而購買股票外滙，忽而囤積貨物棧單，均唯他人馬首是瞻。外滙偶縮，即感然以憂，爭先購進；外滙偶鬆，又恐所存有損，急圖脫售。此種一進一出，幸而獲利，已須付給相當之佣金；不幸失利，實屬無妄之災，噬臍莫及。且此種投機事業，早爲專營是業者所壟斷操縱，本人拾人唾餘，受人利用，不智孰甚。故直言之，投機即有可爲，亦須本人自問於市塲情形，是否明瞭？原來資產是否充裕？萬一失敗，是否不受影響？如無此三者，則反不如存入銀行生息爲愈。惟推一般人之意，以爲存入銀行，有下列三點顧慮：</p>
<p>（一）銀行存息較低，得小償失。銀行存息，活存僅三四厘，定存僅七八魘厘，存息既微，與其呆存銀行，何如自圖營利。此說實未盡然。蓋銀行存息雖低，較之含有危險性之投機事業，實爲穩健。何允銀行旣巳將放款利率，酌量提高，以示消極限制投機；斷不能對於存戶方面，析而不予，不願積極鼓勵儲蓄。</p>
<p>余以爲提高存息可有兩法：（Ａ）由政府保息，內中增高一部份之息，即由政府負担，以示優待，此項存款，可由政府與銀行，共同運用，俾游資移人內地，集中生產。（Ｂ）提倡分紅，除規定存息外，由銀行代爲運用，以其餘利，分給存戶。如此則存戶無投機之危險，而有固定之利益，誠一舉而兩得也。</p>
<p>（二）銀行本身兼營投機事業。又有人以爲銀行本身，亦承做此種投機事業，如囤積貨物買賚外滙等，與其由銀行承做，反不如本人自做爲愈。良以銀行幸而　利，存息並未照加，如不幸失利，則基礎動搖，其影響必及於存戶；故存款實有害而無利。此說驟聞之似有相當理由；惟細察內容，亦不盡然。遑論銀行均由政府相當監督，不能濫做投機；即偶兩買賣外匯，亦自有其用途，絕非一般投機者所有可擬！且大可以擇營業穩健之銀行而存入。如銀行辦理分紅存款，則其資金，無異由銀行代爲經營，則可靠性自較個人猶鉅。</p>
<p>（三）限制提存，又有人以爲政府旣有八一三限制提存在前，又有馬電在後，恐存入銀行，一旦限制，將成呆滯。遑論政府以後決無此舉，即有此舉，本人旣係將餘資存入銀行生息，僅須以利息所入，維持日用開支巳足，又何必顧及此點。</p>
<p>夫人類自私慾，本出自天性，無庸爲諱。且爲保全個人資產計，而囤積貨物，競購外滙等，或另有其不得巳之苦衷。然則保有外滙，股票，貨物，烚赤等，又豈能確保其個人資產耶？實屬疑問，試略述其故：</p>
<p>（一）外匯　在此歐局動亂之今日，誰能擔保各種外滙之本身價値，可維持至何種程度？昔日之英鎊，孰不珍而重之；而今何如？今日各方重視之美金，在一九三三年正爲人人所最不信任之貨幣也。况又誰能確信美國必可維持其中立地位？若認爲外匯之地位總比法幣穩些，此實爲毫無理由之觀念。誠然，滙價下降與物價上漲，無異法幣之跌價。然則世界物價，皆在一致上漲；任何外幣之價値，亦在一致跌價中。要知今日物價之沸漲正係戰時之必然影響。故囤積法幣如以爲危險，則囤積外滙亦有同樣之危險；况中國抗戰拖延至今，日本經濟已瀕山窮永畫，今日亟亟謀和，不龍　待中認人之和平而自設傀傫以屬和，其狼狽之狀，可想而知。此則尤露法幣前途光明之明授。况目前之外匯，業巳縮至最低度，依國際收支狀况而霄，絕無理由。因目前之闢際支付超過，何會較鴃前趣過三倍，今日滙率下降之不合理，由此可以想見。未來放長，自在意中．</p>
<p>（乙）股票　股票價格均巳上漲至最高峯，或已趨過票面數倍，或則竟超過十們以上，然試事　真應得股息，是否亦合　時數倍或十餘們，即可暸然。按一般購買股票之意，以爲此種股票，合息難低，比較稱實可　，殊不知其財產權，均由洋商主持，國人未能置　，如果屬有利，彼等何必出售。且其價格亦大都按法幣計算，豈不矛盾。</p>
<p>（三）烚赤　烚赤將來必由政府收購，旣不能私運出口，又不能私售圖利。至其收購價格，自不能與最近黑市價相符。如今日以高價購入，屆時低價出售，勢必受相當之損失。</p>
<p>（四）貨物貨物囤積過剩，一遇外滙稍鬆，洋貸源源進口，或遇外人傾銷，則價格慘跌，即在目前。且即市價上漲，亦係有行無市。如非業中人，亦不能按巿價出售。坐耗棧租利息，結果恐反有得不償失之苦。</p>
<p>余以爲在此時期，如能裝運內地土貨出口，換取外滙，則實爲一最佳之法、。一方在政府固可發展國外貿易，一方在個人亦可獲取餘潤。况海上人士，來自四方者爲多，其故鄕出產品，自必甚多，熟於此道者亦未必少，與其競相屬積，何如另覓源泉爲愈。</p>
<p>總之在此非常時期，與其　積貨物，競賽購外匯，均非保全資產增加收入之道，反不如國積法幣，　積儉德爲愈。蓋囤積法幣，旣有全　生產作間接之準備，又有現余及保證，作直接之準備，存人銀行，又有相當利息可取·　最穩妥之方法，何必誤入　套，爲他人利用，以有限之精神質物資產，作無益之舉動耶。至銀行在此時期，亦應有相當措置，作抑制投機之舉動，如拒做投機性之押款，等等爲是。</p>

<p>兩性衛生</p>
<h3>女子愛情的變遷</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>擊於丈夫的　精力強弱</p>
<p>兩性的結合，若不能將雙方的個性融洽，往往感情不佳，然而女子對於愛情的保持，恒受自己的慾望爲之轉移，故女子之愛情，最易變動，今日對於其人而寄其多大之愛情者，一旦感情變易，即不難視爲憎人。蓋愛之背景，純爲肉慾之滿足，試觀男子一旦不能滿足女子之慾望之後，即有被其所棄之危險，世人常謂女子之慾望，全受虛榮所支配，而不知除物質虛榮之外，尙有肉慾之享受在也。德國生理學家維斯麥氏謂：「女子之生活，爲性的生活，女子之思想感情，全然發動於性慾」。此誠事實也。試觀被人愛之女子，無論生活上如何愉快，苟一旦其夫不能滿足其慾望，往往不守婦道，在外另尋對象，此即女子發生姦通之一種主要動機，是亦爲硏究女子的心理者所不可不知者也。</p>
<p>故爲丈夫者，應時時注意其生殖機能的健康，素有遺精，滑精，陰痿之疾者，尤宜從速求醫，要知此種疾病，十九由於早年自凟縱慾所致，苟不治之使愈，則雙方愛情之組織味同　蠟，情如冰炭，愛情不能永長，不寗唯是，且其病態會延及全身，如面色蒼白，發育受阻，腰痠背痛，健忘失眠，勃起力喪失，甚至完全陰痿，種種煩惱之疾病，不能一一詳述，故從早治療實爲必要的步驟，現在醫學進步，德國生理學家梅倫博士本三十年之研究，知此種疾病完全由於主宰性慾之生殖腺斷傷而來，乃發明眞正雄壯動物之生殖腺製劑男用「補體康」，並有補腦之燐質，補血之鐵質，補骨之鈣質摻入，服後精神振作，陰痿頃刻消散，該劑藥力週到，廿四小時後即生精補腎，是故功效爲一切內分泌製劑之冠，其女用「補體康」爲卵巢內分泌製劑，功能調經種子，爲婦科良藥</p>
<h3>靑年之無夢而遺興</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>白畫滑精的調治</p>
<p>遺精應分有夢與無夢之別，夢遺較無夢之遺其害爲少，然滑精者，則較無夢而遺爲害尤烈。調治之法，亦應應及其原因，如山手淫過度而生，則宜先戒絕手淫。若由荒淫而來，則尤宜節慾養生。注意巿上之各種固精藥，都以鞏固精關爲號召，切不可濫服，蓋此種藥內含之成分，都有麻醉射精中樞及麻痺精關之毒質在內，其能收暫時之功者，卽靠此麻醉之成分而已。其害與用嗎啡戒煙癮一樣滑稽，流弊無窮，須知飲酖止渴，爲智者所不爲，故最佳之治法，應服藥與攝生並進，凡含有刺激性之煙酒等品，概宜戒絕，身體不可過勞，如能於睡前用冷水摩擦局部十分鐘，能久行不斷，頗有功效。並宜兼服。耐而斯遺精片」，一日僅在睡前服三片，卽能根止遺精，本品絕無副作用，不損消化機能，久服無弊，此爲遺精藥中之祭酒，風行已歷廿餘載，不論任何凶惡之遺精滑精，均有當夜奏效之功，如若身體過弱，則兼以德國內分泌製劑「補體康」以補虧損，兩藥同服，其效如神。</p>
<h3>白濁化學療法之新估計</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>化學療法，爲最近發明療淋最新的名詞。不過利弊參半，並沒有完全十足無弊的成績。故有許多醫家和病家因爲牠的反應很大而　趄懷疑，不敢應用，這固然有相當的理由，不過以現在科學的進步，這種疵點，是可以改進的。而硏究淋病療法最有成績的要算德國淋病大師彼德博士了。彼德博士的思想，　前進的，舉凡各種有效的治淋法，都無不一一試驗殆遍，而最後對於化學療法，覺得於淋病之療法上，確有殊效，惟須改進其不良之成分，偉無反應。故彼德士，於百尺竿頭，再進一步，發明特製化學療法「新克淋儂」一藥，此劑殺菌力十分强大，凡服用之後，此藥之經過胃腸部分，並無不良之反應，良以此劑提煉純粹，不含毒質，故無任何不良之反應，惟其殺滅淋菌之力量，異常强大，直逮病灶，而不妨害其健全之組織，並不如一般之化學療法，有劇烈反應，而致面色變靑，獨「新克淋儂」絕無此項反應，因其殺菌力面面週到，故不論初起時之急性淋，及轉入慢性淋時之各種淋病症狀。服「新克淋儂」皆有迅速之治癒把握，而無貽留不良之預後。在余多年來之臨床經騐，自有「新克淋儂」二藥問世而後，始可稱爲已達到化學療法之最高峯。而此種特效藥，具已博得全球醫家之同聲獎勵賞用云。（「新克淋儂」正威，太和均售）</p>
<h3>淋病講座</h3>
<p>— 姚菊醫師</p>
<p>述診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>時序民細菌　時序與細菌之生存，有莫大之關係，故許多時令的疾病，在其五時令中，則流行頗爲猖獗，而在某一時令中，幾不見其蹤跡。此蓋與氣候活動的效能，有十二分關係之故也。現在且以淋菌的活動而言，淋病的傳染固不限於氣候時令，但對於淋菌的活動，不能不說與氣候無關也。當此春回大地，萬物欣欣向榮之時，而吾人亦因春載陽，於行動方面，亦較嚴寒時爲活動。於是久伏之淋菌，不免乘機出動，肆行爲虐，故有許多未愈之慢性淋，往往要到時春天重行爆發者，其故卽在乎此。更有一種原因。亦爲淋病放肆之要素，即五口人一到春犬，於戀愛方面較他季爲需要。故亦爲淋病傳染之主因也。</p>
<p>易愈的機緣　然而話又應該回過來，在此淋菌最活躍的季節，也就是淋病最易治的季節。因爲此時淋菌久　思動，大有傾巢來犯之勢。所以乘其全部活動時，作一網打盡之根治，實爲一舉數得之事。就余所經驗，惟用淋病聖藥「新克淋儂」（永安公司有售）最佳。因爲「新克淋儂」殺菌之功效，無微不至，乃更用德國靜電療法，及Ｘ線電療交相爲用，結果其潛伏之淋菌，無不迅速撲滅，故新春時序，實爲剿滅淋病最好的機會，幸勿錯過此種良機。</p>
<p>診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十號，每號僅取金五角。</p>
<h3>咯血應速根治</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>關於因結核病之咯血，由於病變部分血管脆弱，因了運動和咳嗽等關係，而突使脈管破裂而成咯血症狀，結核病本爲慢性病，一切病的變化，其經過均極蠕緩。惟咯血一症，爲其突發之事，故須作有效之處置，絕對不可疎忽。惟在學理上及經驗上，咯血並非絕對危篤之症。但亦不能視爲輕微症狀。以余多年來之經騐，在內服藥方面，惟「補肺拿爾」功效最著，不僅可將咯血治愈。即咯血之根源，亦可根治，余謂肺病咯血之並不可畏者，其故卽在於此。且「補肺拿而」有殺滅肺結核菌之奇功，故爲肺病與咯血最有效之內服藥。</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>食信與長壽</h3>
<p>— 孫先導成</p>
<p>上　海難民救濟協會同鄉組勸募委員會主辦之救難游藝大會，昨開百老康樂會時，丁福保醫師當衆詳述長壽方法。茲技與食住兩大要素有關者錄實本刋。（以下丁君所說）長壽之條件，得適宜之飲食，爲最要緊，語曰病從口入，可風食與人之生命，大有關係，能如德國元首希特勒之禁肉食禁烟酒更好，蓋以上各物中，含有極微之毒質，久食容易中毒，最好每天食糙米菜蔬大豆等物因此種物品，因含有豐富之滋養料故也。食鹽尤宜减少，不可多吃，水菓有益人身，不妨多食，能如此，可免血管變硬，血壓過高，腎臟炎肝臓病等。又一切食物，皆且細嚼緩嚥，尤宜　食，最多照本人食量，食至七八分即止，不可食之太飽。我國教育界前輩呂碧城女士，謂世人或以茹素不衛生爲慮，實屬誤解，渠之英友告以維他命在新鮮蔬果，內分ＡＢＣＤＦ五類，爲養生至實，能治各種疾病，幾於一切蔬果中皆有，蓋植物得地力之厚，陽光之暖，雨露之潤，其滋養力之偉大，豈動物之死尸所能比，食肉有害，能發生各種疾病，烟酒不特消耗金錢，且與衛生不宜。以前我國之米麥，皆以石臼舂之，石磨磨之，雖粗而實衛生，自碾穀之機器發明後，珍貴之滋養料，盡被碾除，都市中人不若農村中人之健康者，因食米之精粗，亦有關係。以上是關於食的方面。住則除陽光須充足，空氣須新鮮外，每夜陲眠時間，最好在下午九時，黎明即起。睡時上半夜宜向右邊而臥，下半夜宜向左邊而臥，因上半夜胃之下口，須使其傾向右邊，使停在胃內之食物，易入十二指腸而向小腸輸送，所以宜臥向右邊也。其他如運動能得中庸之道，精神能使安靜，不貪得無厭，不自尋煩惱，凡不可吿人之事，皆不可爲，即儒家所謂愼獨功夫，則自長壽矣。現在孤島上一般公子哥兒，全夜在歡，白晝反睡，不啻自戕生命，惜哉！</p>
<h3>談鞋</h3>
<p>— 沈錫身</p>
<p>近　年來都市中人，不論男女，都喜歡穿着皮鞋，除了女子穿高跟鞋不足取法外；一個人穿了皮鞋以後，走起路來，做起事來，好像容易把精神振作，同時，似乎也比較堂皇一些！</p>
<p>不過近來上海百物飛漲，要買一雙中上等的皮鞋，恐非二三十元不辦，即較次一些的，也須十元左右；所以凡是穿皮鞋的人，以後應該特別節省他的皮鞋，醫如在家中，或者在辦事室中的時候，不妨買雙布鞋穿穿，出外時再換穿皮鞋，這樣調劑調劑，也可以儉省些！</p>
<p>聽說現在內地的人，因爲物價昂貴，所以都穿着布鞋，我以爲上海人也大可效法；　現在市上一雙毛織鞋面紅皮鞋底的客鞋，售價須五六元；年輕人脚步重，往往一雙鞋子祇能穿一二個月就破，這眞太不經濟了！何不改穿布鞋呢？旣樸實，又舒適。</p>
<h3>不可居無竹</h3>
<p>— 哀黎</p>
<p>古　人說得好：「寗可食無肉，不可居無竹」，可見古人愛竹之深，凡是住的地方，總得種幾株竹，才覺風雅。竹本是植物中一樣最有價値的東西，旣可以吃，又可以中，因此鄕下人家，往往有一個竹園，在生產方面，是有很大的助力的。筆者向來愛竹，在故鄉的老家裏，也種有幾十株竹，很喜歡看竹葉的新翠，又喜歡聽竹梢上的雨聲，而在春筍怒茁時，又少不得要借重它作下酒物，所以對於竹的感情是太好了，眞有一日不可無此君之槪。可是故鄕淪陷以後，從沒有回去走一遭，與竹園闊別已久，更休想吃竹筍了。年來侷促海上，住在人家三層樓上，開窗只見左右前後都是鄰居的崖頂或窗子，連一棵樹都瞧不見，休說竹園，古人的「不可居無竹」那句老話，早已推翻了。但是我的竹癖太深，雖住處沒有竹園，仍要買一二盆小竹來作案頭淸供，壁間也得掛幾幅古人的竹畫，以資欣賞，就是這幾天的下酒物，也非竹筍不可。昨天酒後無事，上大新公司參觀糞翁書畫展，糞翁的書法，早已聞名，無論止草隸篆鐘　石鼓，都寫得好，但是畫却從未見過，聽說他這回有畫竹數十件之多，所以特地趕去看看：一看之下，不由不使我佩服，原來他的竹，無論疏的密的，都盡得瀟灑脫俗，簡直要上窺文與可夏仲昭堂奧；板橋道人真不足數了，平日間我甘聽老先生們說過，凡是寫字寫得好的，畫起竹來也一定好，糞翁書法好，無怪一出手就會畫成許多好竹頭哩。題詩多出糞翁自己手筆，我最愛內中一絕：（西望夔州一泫然，莫慚無力報涓涘，一枝聊寄風前意，殺伐原知要箭材。」諷誦冉三，覺陸放翁去人小遠，我想在最短期間，請糞翁一揮如橡之筆，也給我畫一塊石，幾技竹，就題上這首詩，配一個方形鏡架，好掛在我的碧玟玕閣裏，料知夜半風來，定有蕭蕭之聲，從紙背出。</p>
<h3>二種陸上交通的新利器</h3>
<p>— 柳運</p>
<p>近來歐美各國汽車事業的發展，眞有一日千里之勢，聞最近美國某靑年發明家已發明一種夜明汽車」。就是將汽車上塗上一層發燐光的油漆，所以一到晚上，汽車就大發閃爍的亮光，就是在半英里以外的人也都能瞧見呢！</p>
<p>蘇聯某工程師近已發明機車之蒸汽，可以仍將其引回到水鍋內，以節省火車停止加水時的麻煩。這種方法說穿了很是簡單，就是將機車所噴出的蒸汽引到另一裝貯器裏面，使它冷却後再凝成水，然後將它重行灌入水鍋裏面。有了這樣的裝置，就可使火車繼績行駛四五白里以上的路程了。</p>
<h3>二全夫妻之衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 旅觀</p>
<p>在　昔君主時代之爲人，不過一條出路，全國人才只聚於廊廟，變成「腦水腫式」絕大而肢體不發育之國家，是以『十全之人生』，僅以『大富貴亦壽考』之六字爲標凖，如此舊觀念，用諸科學昌明民治進化之後世，當然極不相宜。國內同胸欲求一生得快樂，首應了解學國男女何者之爲十全幸福，吾則費盡一生心計，不獨不能起爲全國同胞圖樂利，抑且不知求爲自身謀幸福。近如美國報界訪尋十全夫妻大競賽之妙法，我國如能仿而行之，深足糾正社會錯誤之觀念，別闢國家上進之途，並足相度經濟環境，自得有節制與有計畫之娛遊，而令中國各地，產生無量數十全幸福之家庭也。</p>
<p>美報所謂『十全夫妻』主要條件，乃設四問，普徧徵求。</p>
<p>（一）夫須立志向上，而有優良之氣禀，妻須和諧漂亮，而無任何之職業。（按此條重在『求全』，非謂女性不應有職業也。</p>
<p>（二）夫之收入，以每年達一千五百美金者爲最低限度。（按美國生活奇昂，每年一千五百金之收入，幾可謂爲成婚男子最低級之俸薪，的合幣價未落時國府部員八十元之月俸。）</p>
<p>（三）妻須善於烹調。</p>
<p>（四）須有三孩，尤妙者爲兩男一女。</p>
<p>厥後從讀者之一方面，接到筆答之函數萬件，經過主編人員之詳細考查，其被取列第一名之『標凖十全夫妻』，乃係結婚滿十年，每月可進二百美金之花州Florida羨市GainesviHe人孟陶氏McDonnell小家庭。夫年三十五，妻年三十一，現今生有兩子，長子名華盛頓，决子名天授Ｔｈｅｏ－ｄｏｒｅ．夫婦十年相處，口角者止一次，聞其所爭，乃因長子命名一問題之夫妻意見不一致，厥後卒從夫議，而以美國第一代總統之姓，爲長子之小名。迨其决子出世，則從妻議，而以第二十五代總統老羅斯福之小名（天授）爲小名。西俗無論何事，均不肯向人模仿而自後於人，惟爲子女命名，不獨不能各具『個性』，且猶析靳爲各不相下之爭，殊非遠東之人所易了解也。茲將孟陶氏家庭之衣食住行，分誌如下：</p>
<p>衣：每年妻之費於此．門者，僅置兩套新衣，並加購兩頂新帽，且均在衣市大减價之一定期限以內求得之。此條在歐美家庭，莫不譽爲至儉，蓋西人男子之衣，無時樣之改變，可以小心保用多年而不敝也。</p>
<p>食：夫妻終年在家進餐，惟在每一星期之內，妻有一個下半天，出預女友之茶會，或在家請女友茶會。夫則一星期中有一，消耗時晷於總會之中。（歐洲人則契友更番小叙，亦每星期一次，）此外夫必日飲長生水燒酒Whiskey盃，（此酒恒拼汽水，飲於深夜）日進淡巴菰兩斗，並紙捲烟十枝。（按Whiskey爲愛爾蘭語，下半曰長生Beatha，上半曰水Uisgｅ）</p>
<p>住：在家有小園精舍，而不雇女傭。</p>
<p>行：出鬥有目備汽車，而不勞御者。每星期進影戲園一次，每月進戲館或音樂廳一次，每三個月之內一遊展覽會，或者不看展覽會，而向博物院縱覽。每逢日曜休假，出遊於苑野，自必夫婦子女盡室偕行。</p>
<h3>一星期期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>在上這海經濟居大不易的時期，不必說鷄鴨魚肉吃不起了，就是貧民借以下飯的平常菜蔬，也沒有一樣小漲價，眞要逼得人家做不吃人間烟火食的神仙了。說起菜蔬類中比較便宜的東西，只有黃豆芽和茶豆芽，每斤的價錢都在一角半左右，煮好之後，可以裝兩滿碗，足供日夜兩餐之需。黃豆芽有一種天然的鮮味，維他命也豐富，並且很耐咀嚼，確是平民化的食品。做葷菜時，以與牛肉片同燜爲最相宜，先將黃豆芽炒過一炒，然後加入牛肉片一同紅燜，湯可放大，泡飯吃十分鮮美。倘有不吃牛肉的，那麼代以猪肉片，也很可口。茶豆芽一稱銀芽，倘與燒鴨絲同炒，可上筵席，平時炒炒肉絲，不要炒得太熟，自然爽脆，此外可隨心所欲，加些韭芽或搾菜絲在內，也別有風味的。</p>

<h3>孤島上之一大問題</h3>
<p>— 楊子</p>
<p>黑籍同你敢，都應：臥而思，坐而言，起而行！</p>
<p>禁令森嚴日，春光明媚時，沉淪苦海者，戒痼莫遲遲。</p>
<p>「現在是什麼時候」？這是我首先要詢問孤島上黑籍同胞的一句話。</p>
<p>政府一向積極進行的禁煙政策，到本月三十一日，已屆戒絕的限期。報載政府當局，決定澈底執行，自四月一日起，如有再吸鴉片，一律處以死刑，就是年老疾病的煙民，也一律嚴格辦理，決不通融。可見鴉片的生命，只有幾天的殘喘了。雖則孤島上的吸煙者，在政府鞭長莫及之下，還得苟延時日，然而危險性總是很大的，試想，吸煙人從下月一日起，就背着一個可怕的死刑，不是要很不安嗎。所以在此時期，吸烟人是不可不戒。　現在，風和日暖之期，正是戒烟的好機會。同時，土價如此的昂貴，白米如此的昂貴一切的物價，也都如此的昂貴。所以，要抵抗大時代的洪流，要樹立奮鬥的基礎，要開闢光明的前途，在此時期，吸烟人是不應不戒。因爲吸烟人在此時期，經不能不戒，不應不戒，於是在一種投機的心理下，形成了戒烟藥品的狂潮，晰以有志戒烟者，處在這個狂潮之中，應當特別審愼，要是費了金錢，不但不能達到戒除的目的，反而增加烟毒的嚴重性，害及整個的身體機構，那比了吸烟，還要不合算，所以，戒烟最重要的問題，就是選擇良好的醫師切忌把自己的身體，做那投機性的藥物的試騐品。</p>
<p>白克路　　醫院來公亮醫師，已積十餘年的戒烟經騐，戒絕的人，屈指難數。所有堆積盈尺的感謝信函，卽是鐵一般的成績。（關於無數的感謝信，本可製版刊登，但因來醫師不喜作誇大宣傳，寧願節省廣吿費，減輕戒烟人的負担。諸君欲明眞相，儘可到院去翻閱。）至於來醫師戒烟方法的安全良善，在過去的各報上面，常有忠實報道的刊出。想來有志戒烟者，也都明瞭來醫師的戒烟決非野狐　可比。如戒時工作如常，精神反勝於吸烟之時，斷癮於不知不覺之中，戒後永不反癮，也師是來醫師戒烟最彰明的四個特點（一）睡眠安穩，（一）大便通暢，（一）精神煥發，（一）飲食增加，凡曾受戒於來醫師的人，都肯拿人格來擔保的，因爲來醫師爲人戒烟，能負完全責任，保證安全戒除，譬如鄙人就是由來醫師給我戒除烟癮的一份子。就因爲吸烟人最高因循心理，所以特地向吸烟諸消提醒一句，因吸烟人在這時期，實在不能再因循了。公健醫院地址。在英和界白克路二〇八號。電話九五二一。諸君如有戒烟上之問題，請向公健醫院面絢。並定有試服辦法，以昭大價云。</p>

<h3>紀念蔡孑民先生</h3>
<p>— 張一磨</p>
<p>孑民先生與余同年同月生，先余十一日。去臘舊曆十七日其弟子余君天民來謁，曰：今日蔡先生生日，不延外客，因公爲老友，特的午間往談。是日，蔡師母自設　，座中惟先生猶子太冲夫婦與戚某君及天民及主人主婦耳。上月因事又往談二三次，不圖其遺世之速也。歿前一日午餐，健啖如常，午後俯地拾物蹉跌，旋唾紫色血，醫者謂胃潰瘍，舁至養和醫院，四肢厥冷，氣息僅存，乃由其猶子輸血四碗，俄手足蠕動，惟舌音已蹇，於翌晨九時三刻氣絕。陳君彬龢旣經紀其喪，以病狀吿余，且請爲事略以供史料，旣不與先生訣別，乃記我二人之交誼及感想，歐陽子所謂上爲天下惜下以哭其私也。</p>
<p>先生以庚寅名進士入翰林，試卷出吾鄉王蒿隱年丈房，首塲不類八股文奇之，及二三塲卷，則淵博無比，乃併三塲荐之，且爲延譽，吾聞之年丈子季烈，季同云。</p>
<p>淸光緒中，爲南洋公學敎員，學潮起則設愛國學校，推先生主之。是時當局以壓迫學潮爲宗旨，未幾與吳稚暉章太炎烏目山僧諸君子八人同被緝，乃出國而入中山先生之同盟會。</p>
<p>癸卯余以特科由舉人發往直隸，以知縣補用入北洋幕府；先生在海外，不及捧手。辛亥革命，中山爲大總統，先生長敎育部。暨中山讓位項城，以同盟會內閣連帶去職下野。</p>
<p>其入敎育部也，以范靜孫爲决長，部員中如夏曾佑魯迅等皆異才，不以黨系爲標準，所草章則翕然爲民國開山。民四余因諫阻帝制出長敎部，一本先生宗旨，見讀音統一會檔案，萃二十省蒙藏代表於一堂，將畫一語文。未及行，余乃請設注昔字母傳習所，是爲敎部國語統一會之濫觴，先生爲會長，稚暉先生與余副之，各省之推廣國語，民八後課本改白話文皆由先生倡之。范靜孫長部，痛京師大學之腐敗，乃改爲獨立制，延先生長之。先生以王國維辜鴻銘劉師培等講舊文學，胡適錢玄同陳獨秀講新文學，合各派於一爐而冶之，河海不擇細流，道並行而不相悖，萬物並育而不相害，何具大也。</p>
<p>五四運動，政府以兵圍北大學生，先生使蔣夢鱗代校務留一字條於几上曰：（殺君馬者道旁兒」，遂潛出。此後言學風者，舊派集矢於先生之放任，而新派則以爲中國學生救國之先聲。美國杜威博士，適在京講學，以爲學生運動可以表示一種新覺悟，（杜威演講集）自有公評聽諸後世。</p>
<p>民六七年間，美使苪恩施與熊秉三先生等爲中美協翅會會長，先生與王亮疇先生及余皆入會，月集二次。十一年先生自歐洲歸上海，黃任之君的余同迓之。先生謂國內須有自由集會團體，乃有國是會議之舉，推余日章先生爲會長，終以經費不繼，而旋罷去。唐（紹儀）朱（啟鈐）南北和議繼之，中山北上宣言繼之，終未收統一之功。</p>
<p>北伐成功，先生爲中央監察委員兼中央研究院長。其間承常　龐甸才君之約，遊處山，與先生同臥起，故上年贈詩云：「更爲虞山堅後的，凱歌聲裏共陶然」之句。今後重遊虞山，當酹酒以酌先生之靈，並唱凱歌侑之。</p>
<p>八二三後，先生微服避港。以周子餘隱姓埋名，翌年五月，余遷港時往訪，知在故都德國醫院割脚腓。後至港久割一次，行步惟艱。因新文字運動，先生與孫哲生院長曾有七百餘人之宣言，允爲名譽理事長，時時請益。德配周養浩夫人，調護起居甚周至，且有唱酬之樂。兩月前先生謂我：兩眼眚生，醫家勸割，以年老未行手術。又一醫謂勿割，以藥水洗之，燈下不便看書矣。近有致余詩數首當鑄鋅版以存絕筆。</p>
<p>先生與人無町畦，從無怒色。無論何事，皆以研究態度出之。宋人謂：見程明道如坐春風中；殆有此風象。好學深思，手不釋卷。自制馬相老習臘丁文，出國後，　德日英法文字，無不　習，在港每日開報，故不出戶，而了了於時局。識與不識，奉爲泰山北斗，而　須臾解脫，但精神永留於天地之間，爲民主國模範。先生以國愛平等爲宗旨，嘆國民敎育之未普及，漢字的獨輪車不及大衆，故於新文字大聲疾呼。當此抗戰建國時期，政府篤念老成，必有以完先生遺志，爲四萬五千萬人造福，先生可以瞑矣。</p>
<h3>讀「九十九漲價論」有感</h3>
<p>— 禇</p>
<p>巴金提議增加稿費運動後，讀到一篇「九十九漲價論」，道題目似乎很幽默，但是作者的筆尖是並不幽默的，正和我的「讀後感」一樣感到無限的沉痛。文人的窮是自古已然，而且「窮而後工」彷彿是最榮譽的褒獎；但是現在不是（藏之名山」的時候，如果再有像科舉時代那樣的書獃子，閉戶讀書，漏夜撰著，那末他的窮是活該，因爲那些祇有形式沒有內容的「文章」即使「工」了也是毫無價値的。抗戰以後，文人們的筆桿上的工作是並不落後的，在前綫，在後方，甚至在淪陷區，他們並沒有忘了他們的責任，發揚文字的眞正價値。蔣委員長說小學敎昌在課室敎訓子弟，無異於前綫戰壕中的將士，那文人在抗戰中所盡的力量，至少也有着不可磨滅的光輝。但文人的窮是而今允烈，在一切漲價聲中，文人連小學敎員那樣呼籲的機會都沒有，且社會給予他們的同情也更在小學敎員之下。巴金還是個成名作家（這里沒有把「成名」和「無名」作爲區別作家的意思），其他無名作家的生活當可想而知了！</p>
<p>在這時候發表文章雖小是冀求金錢上的價値，但文人的生活是祇能在文字上求之的。所以我的「有感」希望也是一般　商，報章雜誌的出版者的「有感」。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>廿二回　新聞要訉天外費來　崇議宏論人間信仰</p>
<p>從紙版處打好紙版，便送到澆版處的澆版爐旁。紙版處有打紙版機器六台，十二版新聞，可以同時打紙版。澆版處也有溶爐，具，可以同時澆鉛版。因爲每一溶爐的下部，有一管口，只要一旋之下，鉛液便注於澳版器內。解開後，就成了半圓式全版的鉛字版，可以安放在機器滾筒之上了。她們走出那裏時，邵慧華道：「這裏有個小的紙棧房，也可以看看，好在那個棧房終年不閉門的。」這是一個近於地下室了，雖然邵慧華說僅不過一個堆紙的小倉庫，然則也可以堆積六百件大捲筒紙。因爲據邵慧華說：另有一個大倉庫，却在館外，不在館內。此外有幾家特的的中國造紙廠，也可以寄存在那裏，隨時出貨。這裏的紙庫，不過是供數天或星期之用罷了。從紙庫到機器房，却有兩條小的電車軌道，這是專爲運送捲筒紙而用的。運送捲筒紙，不須用人力，只把整件送上平車，循此軌道，自動的推送到輪轉機上。傍邊自有兩個工人，專管紙件，那捲筒紙便一筒擠上筒的排列在那裏，筒用完，一筒便接匕，冉便當迅速也沒有了。在紙庫也不過望望而已，要看到他們工作的活躍，頂好是要到半夜裏來。從紙庫出來，她們便到排字房來。這排字房却在二層樓上，也是大廣間，字架却擺得密密層層。只見已有一部份人在那裏工作了，大概這是排每日的廣吿，以及副刋等不重要的稿子等等，可以從容暇豫一點。至於重要的新聞，還沒有到時候咧。可是排字房裏，已經電燈輝煌，工作就要開始了。她們見由排字房通到上層，也有好幾個天窗。而每一排字架之上，都裝有雙綫電籃，由天窗直送至上層。瞿無雙道：『我們的編輯部，都在三層樓，而校對房也在三層樓。所以編輯部發稿子到排宇房，即由電籃送到這裏，而排字房排好了稿子，送到校對房，也由電籃送去。如此則省了人工奔走之勞：不然，地方旣大，跑來跑去，也很費時間咧。因爲編輯部，排字房，校對室，這一個機關是有密切關係的。還有排字房到小樣間，小樣間到拼版室，拼版室到大樣間，你們瞧這電籃也裝得眞密如蛛網列。』</p>

<p>Chongqing: General Bai Chongxi said to army officers in Guilin today that Wang Jingwei's "Kuomintang" in Nanjing does not need to be taken seriously, but it cannot be ignored either. We must use political counterattacks or instigate political struggles in the rear of the Japanese army to destroy it. Bai also said that observing the recent withdrawal of Japanese troops from Linhu in Suiyuan and Lingshan in Guangxi, it can be seen that although the Japanese army can occupy a place, it cannot hold it.

The "Central Political Conference" recently held in Nanjing is clear evidence of the Japanese intention. He also said that the Japanese slogans and various organizations such as the "New People's Society" are all aimed at overthrowing the Chinese people's concept of nationalism and the Kuomintang.

When it reached the vicinity of the four tracks of Xuzhou East Station, it collided with a Japanese military train heading south on the Jinpu Railway, causing the entire train to be destroyed. Over 500 Japanese were killed or injured. Five attached locomotives were also destroyed in the collision. It is reported that the Japanese losses in this incident exceed 2 million yuan.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Japan's Struggle</h3>
<p>The issue between China and Japan has a history of over sixty years. From the late Qing Dynasty to the eve of the War of Resistance, almost every possible solution has been tried. However, the result of its development has only proven that war between the two countries is inevitable, and only a thorough war is the only way to thoroughly resolve the China-Japan issue. Therefore, this situation of resistance may be seen by some as unfortunate, but it is actually a historical necessity.</p>
<p>The emergence of the Far East as a problem lies, on the one hand, in China's accumulated weakness in the past, and on the other hand, in Japan's ambition to annex China and dominate East Asia. Since Japan took the lead in the Meiji Restoration, it has consistently regarded China as the target of its expansion for decades. Saigo Takamori's theory of conquering Korea, Okuma's Twenty-One Demands, Tanaka's Memorial, and the various measures and actions of the Japanese military clique since the September 18th Incident all treated China as meat on the chopping block. Even the Japan-Wang Jingwei documents disclosed two months ago still show that the Japanese military clique's dream of invading and subjugating China has not awakened. As long as the ambition of the Japanese military clique is not completely liquidated, how can there be peace in the East, and there will be no true peace in the world. Therefore, China's War of Resistance, from any perspective, has the necessity to thoroughly fulfill its objective mission. This is also a major obligation that China bears towards the East and even the world.</p>
<p>As for China's past weakness, it is an undeniable fact. Unfortunately, in the middle of revolution and construction, everything just saw the dawn and was invaded. Now, it has completely changed. Undoubtedly, this is an important side harvest in the War of Resistance. The unity and progress in the political and military fields need not be said. Even the increase in international reputation and the tempering of national character are not things that can be achieved overnight in peacetime. Other things such as transportation construction, economic development, the progress of inland society, and the improvement of culture in the border provinces are all obvious facts that are universally recognized. What is particularly valuable is that from more than two years of this arduous effort, a strong confidence and decisive perseverance have been forged, showing the revival of the Chinese national soul and the resurrection of national youth. All these achievements in the middle of the War of Resistance cannot be obliterated by any slander. Any ancient country often accumulates too much dross left over from history in society, causing the nation to form a morbid state, and even giving people a sense of aging. Under such circumstances, getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new is often several times more difficult than starting from scratch. However, once a national war against foreign countries is engaged in, either it will be completely defeated and collapsed, or it will achieve rapid progress in a very short period of time. This is also a common occurrence in ancient and modern history. The unification of Germany, the independence of Italy, and the revival of Turkey are all obvious examples. This time, China needs a national war against foreign countries. The first step to success is to smash the other side's strategy of a quick victory, which is the first step to overcome the crisis of complete defeat and collapse. From then on, it has transformed into an opportunity for rapid progress. The glorious magnificence of Germany, Italy, and Turkey is indeed a precedent, while it is an unprecedented miracle in Chinese history. It was because China was weak that the Sino-Japanese War was triggered, but at the same time, it was because of the tempering of this war that China turned from weak to strong. In the midst of the war, China did suffer significant damage, but it also gained more because of the war.</p>
<p>Everyone believes that China is by no means a militaristic nation. If China engages in war, then this war must be absolutely unavoidable. In other words, China would never resist unless absolutely necessary, and would not resist until the last moment. The War of Resistance is by no means to go to death, but to seek survival. Therefore, at the beginning of the outbreak of the War of Resistance, there was a clear estimate of the future prospects, and the determination to persevere in the War of Resistance and endure painful sacrifices was made. Today, reviewing the bloody experience of more than two years is enough to prove the wisdom and intelligence of the estimate at that time, and it is in line with the factual deduction. Now, even though it is not yet the stage to drive the Japanese army out of China, sufficient confidence and certainty have been gained. Moreover, in the long stalemate, the Japanese army has actually become weakened and exhausted, and the military and civilians are tired of war. Its turn to step up political offensives shows that it has lost military confidence. Looking back over the past year, the Japanese army's defeat in central Hubei, its re-collapse in northern Hunan, the mixed battles in western and southern Shanxi, and the defeat in Binyang and northern Guangdong have all proven the decline of the Japanese army's strength and the failure of its invasion attempts. Although it also once achieved a small victory in Nanchang, Chaozhou, Shantou, Qin, Fang, Yong, and Ning, it ultimately failed to save its overall war situation. Recently, the Japanese side is at a critical juncture of making a desperate political offensive and going against the tide. The battlefields in southern Guangxi and western Sui have once again brought news of the recapture of Lingshan and Wuyuan, which is just like a head-on blow to that offensive. Recently, the frequent movements of the Japanese troops on various fronts are probably to echo their political offensive with their final struggle. However, as long as the Chinese military and civilians are firmer and more invigorated, the Japanese side's new military deployment will inevitably fall into the same predicament of being unable to advance or retreat as its political offensive. There is no doubt that the future of China's War of Resistance will not be affected in any way.</p>
<p>China's liberation and progress, and East Asia's stability and peace can only be achieved through victory in the War of Resistance. Apart from this, any methods and plans will only increase chaos and disturbance. This is the destiny that history has destined, and it is also the point that the world should recognize most clearly.</p>

<p>Chongqing: Various circles in the Provisional Capital held a public memorial ceremony for Mr. Cai Ziming this morning at the Chongqing Art College, and a memorial service for Mr. Cai this afternoon. The situation was extremely solemn. A colorful archway was erected outside the gate of the venue, decorated with flowers forming the words "Memorial Service for Mr. Cai Ziming." Upon entering, there was a horizontal plaque from the Chongqing Peking University Alumni Association reading "Mountain Collapses, Tree Decays," and inside was a plaque from the National Political Council reading "Educational Influence Endures." The spiritual platform was hung with a horizontal plaque from the Central Executive and Supervisory Committee reading "Teacher of the Masses," and a plaque from Chairman Lin reading "Great Achievements in Cultivation."

<h3>Wounded Soldier Chen Zhongli Donates Money to Comfort Soldiers</h3>
<p>Jian: Chen Zhongli, a wounded soldier from the Xth Disabled Hospital, was wounded in the War of Resistance. It has been a year since then. He has repeatedly wanted to go to the front line, but was stopped due to physical disability. Now, he saves money by cutting down on food and clothing, saving 10 yuan in legal tender, and presents it to comfort the soldiers at the front.

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Government Promotes New County System</h3>
<p>Shaoguan: In order to mobilize the people's strength, strengthen grassroots organizations, and promote local production to meet the needs of the War of Resistance and national construction, the Guangdong Provincial Government has decided to implement the new county system.

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia Donate the Most</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from here today, among the overseas Chinese donating to the motherland, those in Southeast Asia are the most enthusiastic. In total, in 1939, the donations from overseas Chinese in British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Burma, Hong Kong, Siam (i.e., Thailand), Borneo, and French Annam totaled 67,000,000 yuan. Based on the fact that there are 7 million overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, the average donation per person last year reached 88 yuan, and the monthly donation reached 7 yuan. It is also reported that remittances from overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia have been greatly restricted by local authorities since the outbreak of the European War. Since January of this year, overseas Chinese in Siam have not been allowed to remit money to China. When overseas Chinese in Annam remit money to the motherland, they must obtain government permission. The total amount of remittances from overseas Chinese in Singapore may not exceed 500,000 yuan per month. At the same time, overseas Chinese in the United States, Canada, and other countries do not donate as enthusiastically as those in Southeast Asia. (United Press dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Plans to Establish Defenses on North Pacific Islands, Sufficient to Threaten Japan's Wartime Food Supply, Japanese Councilor Suggests Purchasing Primorsky Krai</h3>
<p>New York: It is rumored that the Soviet Union is currently planning to establish defensive fortifications on the Kamchatka Islands off the coast of Siberia. The New York Times today criticized this specifically, believing that after the Soviet Union deployed submarine bases on these islands, it will threaten the shipping of Western countries in the Pacific, especially when a war breaks out between the Soviet Union and Japan, which will be sufficient to threaten Japan's food supply. It also has harm to the military strategy position of the US Navy, because from these islands to Dutch Harbor in the United States, it only takes five hours to reach by plane. (United Press dispatch of the 24th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: At the Japanese parliament, there was an inquiry about purchasing the Soviet Primorsky Krai opposite Sakhalin. Foreign Minister Arita replied that this issue must be considered carefully, and that all outstanding issues between the Soviet Union and Japan should first be resolved in a friendly manner.

<h3>Three Years of Japanese Invasion of China, Resources Depleted: Canadian Bank Annual Report Details Japanese Economic Situation</h3>
<p>Washington: The "Washington Evening Star" stated yesterday that the establishment of a "new government" in Nanjing, as announced from Tokyo, as a sign of China's revival is a "laughable fabrication." The newspaper stated in its editorial that Japan's creation of this "new government" is a "cunning scheme that cannot deceive the Chinese people and the world." Chairman Chiang still possesses considerable strength for resistance, while the depletion of Japan's domestic economy and its strained relations with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are its greatest difficulties. After three years of war in China, Japan is now in a dilemma of national collapse and diplomatic isolation, and will soon try to end this undeclared "incident." (United Press report, 24th)</p>
<p>New York Airmail: The Royal Bank of Canada recently released its 1939 annual report, detailing the Japanese economic situation, stating, "Japan's war against China has lasted nearly three years. Although the country's war-making capabilities are not completely exhausted, it can be confidently said that its resources have been severely depleted. Therefore, in recent months, most people in the country have felt that, for Japan's sake, the China situation should be brought to an end in a relatively short period." (Havas report)</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Mission to Visit Italy on a Regular Basis</h3>
<p>Rome: A Japanese economic mission, including several experts from Japan and "Manchukuo," led by former Foreign Minister Naotake Satō, is scheduled to visit Italy in May for inspection. In addition, Angelo, the director of the Italian Commercial Office in Japan, is also scheduled to return home for a visit within a certain period. Well-informed sources here believe that Italy is likely to be conducting negotiations with Japan and "Manchukuo" to restore the balance of trade between the two parties. (Havas report, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Restrictions on Tea Imports, Chinese Tea on the Prohibited List</h3>
<p>Amsterdam: Yesterday, the British Ministry of Food issued an order prohibiting the import of tea from the Dutch East Indies and China, allowing only the import of tea from British India and Ceylon. (Haitong News Agency report, 24th)</p>
<p>London: Economic figures here recently commented that India and Ceylon have had favorable rainfall this year, and the tea harvest has been extremely abundant. The entire output has now been purchased by the British government. In the future, Britain will no longer import tea from China and Java. Chinese tea, at the lowest price, is sixpence cheaper per pound compared to the cheapest tea from India. In addition, the government, in order to reduce tea consumption, has informed the public of various conservation methods and estimated that each pound of tea can brew 200 cups.

<h3>Joint German-Italian Policy: Maintaining Peace in the Balkans; Italy Will Not Allow Foreign Forces to Enter Yugoslavia; Germany Plans to Restructure the Economic Organizations of Southeastern Europe</h3>
<p>Paris: Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki is currently visiting Rome. Political figures here are commenting that, given the situation in Southeastern Europe, Prime Minister Teleki's trip is of extraordinary significance. However, the European situation has greatly changed since Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano several months ago. Foreign Minister Ciano had offered a promise, stating that if Hungary were attacked by the Soviet Union, Italy would come to its aid, provided that Hungary would maintain close relations with Romania and temporarily abandon its demands for border revisions. At that time, the Soviet-Finnish War was in a stalemate, and Ciano's promise could be considered timely. Since German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass and formulated a joint policy on the situation in Southeastern Europe, the Danube region and the Balkan Peninsula seem to be jointly "protected" by Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union. However, since Italy is determined to prevent the current war from spreading to Southeastern Europe, it is still unknown whether it will allow Soviet forces to enter the area. One of the issues that Prime Minister Teleki should explore with the Italian authorities is this. (Havas report, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris: Béchet, Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, recently published an article in "L'Ordre," commenting on the situation in Southeastern Europe. The gist of his remarks was that "Yugoslavia is as important to Italy as Czechoslovakia is to Germany. It is to be expected that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini would not want the forces of other countries to extend into Yugoslavia." (Havas report, 24th)</p>
<p>Paris: Newspapers here have recently reported from the capitals of the Balkan Peninsula countries that Germany is currently promoting a broad plan to restructure the entire economic organizations of the Southeastern European countries, demanding that these countries reduce part of their military equipment, reduce industrial production, and thereby increase the quantity of agricultural products to supply Germany. It is also reported that detailed production plans have been drawn up for each country, with detailed content. This will certainly be quickly addressed by Britain and France, and Italy's attitude is also worth noting. (Havas report, 23rd)</p>
<p>Basel, Switzerland: Newspapers here recently received news from Central Europe that Germany's proposal for Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union to jointly provide guarantees to the Balkan Peninsula countries has encountered difficulties. According to the Basler Nachrichten, the countries concerned in the Balkan Peninsula have not welcomed this plan and have even expressed suspicion because Germany has not consulted them. Yugoslav diplomats even believe that the country has no diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, and it is doubtful whether the country can accept Soviet guarantees unless Italy adds strong pressure. In short, the Balkan Peninsula countries generally believe that Germany's proposed guarantee plan is unlikely to succeed. It is speculated that its intention is to urge the Soviet Union to pursue a more cautious policy in the Balkan Peninsula. (Havas report, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Foreign Policy: Avoiding Involvement in the War; Temporarily Not Raising Treaty Revision Demands; Hungarian Prime Minister to Meet with Italian Prime Minister Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Rome: It is believed here yesterday that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki will hold talks with Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano next week. (United Press report, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome: After Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki arrived here yesterday, Foreign Minister Ciano hosted a banquet for him in the evening. Many important figures from both Italy and Hungary were invited to accompany him. Newspapers here recently commented on Prime Minister Teleki's visit, praising Hungary's current policy, which is to temporarily not raise demands for revising the peace treaty, saying that any country that uses inappropriate means at this time to resolve individual problems will inevitably expand the scope of the current war and only harm the interests of non-belligerent countries. Hungary's refusal to do so is admirable. (Havas report, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome: Political figures here believe that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki's visit to Rome has confirmed the general impression after Hitler and Mussolini met at the Brenner Pass, that Italy believes that Hungary's demands for revising the treaty have no opportunity for discussion at present. "Il Giornale d'Italia" stated that Hungary is well aware that in the current situation, it is not allowed to make special demands and disrupt the peace of the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube region. "Il Popolo d'Italia" stated that after the Hungarian Prime Minister meets with the Italian authorities, it will certainly enhance the friendly relations between Hungary and Slovakia, Yugoslavia, the Soviet Union, and Romania. Hungary does not give up its rights, nor is it eager to realize its goals, but waits for the appropriate time. Hungary's foreign policy is to avoid involvement in the vortex of war and cooperate with Italy to maintain peace in Southeastern Europe. (Haitong report, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry's mouthpiece, the "German Diplomatic Political Correspondence," declared that Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki's visit to Italy will not have surprising results. Countries that maintain friendly relations should maintain close contact, and it is especially necessary to maintain contact during serious times. The leaders of the Axis powers have recently held talks, and countries that maintain friendly relations with the Axis powers are also urgently discussing the Danube issue with the Italian authorities. Southeastern Europe has been spared disturbances due to the keen insight and responsible spirit of the authorities of various countries, but certain issues remain to be resolved to avoid countries taking advantage of the disputes between the great powers to make attempts. The Allied powers have considerable intentions to incite the disturbance of various countries in Southeastern Europe, but Southeastern European countries such as Hungary have rejected this temptation and demonstrated the foresight of their politicians. All countries in Southeastern Europe must avoid involvement in the vortex of war. Germany and Italy closely monitor the happiness of Southeastern Europe and will do their utmost to maintain peace in Southeastern Europe. (Haitong report, 24th)</p>
<h3>Pope Sternly Condemns International Acts of Aggression: Heartbroken at Dishonesty and Destruction; Prays to God for Early Restoration of Peace</h3>
<p>Vatican City: Pope Pius XII recently preached to the faithful in St. Peter's Basilica, condemning acts of violating public reason and destroying treaties, as well as unrestrained desires for conquest. He said, "What kind of era are we in? You should be aware of this. The harmony of nations has been broken, solemnly signed treaties have been unilaterally modified or destroyed, all things that are beneficial to the prosperity and progress of all nations have been derailed, and even the public reason on which the mutual relations of civilized nations are based has been violated. For example, undefended cities and villages inhabited by farmers are often bombed by airplanes, residents are shocked, houses are destroyed, fields are damaged, and ordinary civilians and the old, weak, sick, and disabled who have no self-defense capabilities are either bombed to death or displaced and homeless." His words were truly heartbreaking. "I now piously pray to God to ensure that the monarchs and royalty of all countries and people can enjoy peace and be in harmony." (Havas report, 24th)</p>
<h3>Nordic Alliance Unlikely to Become a Reality Due to Opposition from Both the Soviet Union and Germany</h3>
<p>Moscow: Soviet newspapers commented on the plan for Sweden, Norway, and Finland to sign a defensive alliance, believing that the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty has completely thwarted the Allied powers' attempt to incite war in Northern Europe. The Nordic countries have already been outside the war zone, and the Allied powers naturally cannot accept this. The Soviet Union is working to realize peace and mutual cooperation among the Nordic countries, and the true background of the so-called "defensive alliance" is to establish an anti-Soviet front. (Haitong report, 24th)</p>
<p>London: Well-informed sources here recently stated that the proposal for Finland, Norway, and Sweden to form a defensive alliance treaty may not be easily realized. Since the Soviet Union has already expressed its opposition to this, and Germany has also adopted the same attitude, the Swedish government is deeply afraid of causing disputes as a result, so it is hesitant. According to Germany and the Soviet Union, if this alliance treaty can have anti-British and French implications, so that their forces cannot extend into the Nordic countries in the future, and at the same time increase the volume of trade with the two countries, then Germany and the Soviet Union can support it. However, according to the actual situation, the Scandinavian countries intend to conclude this treaty as a tool for self-defense, which is the opposite of what Germany and the Soviet Union intend, so it is to be expected that they will express opposition. Norway and Sweden, in view of this, would rather adopt a more subtle attitude towards the belligerent countries and do not want to conclude a treaty to invite future troubles. For this reason, the proposal for the three Nordic countries to form a defensive alliance is very difficult to realize. (Havas report, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Reason for Search of Welles' Ship: Allegedly Someone Had a Forged Passport; British Blockade Intensifies</h3>
<p>London: Reuters learned from official circles that the Italian mail ship "Conte di Savoia" was indeed searched by the British, because British officials received intelligence that an important person was traveling on this ship with a forged passport. (Reuters report, 24th)</p>
<p>London: London officials have not confirmed the claim that the Italian mail ship "Conte di Savoia" was searched by the British in Gibraltar in order to arrest German economic expert Dr. Schacht or other wanted figures. British officials are also unwilling to explain why the Italian ship was searched. According to news from New York yesterday, the Italian ship was detained for thirteen hours and searched very thoroughly in order to find Dr. Schacht, who was rumored to be on board. It is noted that U.S. Undersecretary Welles returned to the United States on this ship after touring Europe. (Reuters report, 23rd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: The Gibraltar British authorities' inspection of passengers on the Italian mail ship "Conte di Savoia" is considered by the outside world to be a more severe measure of the British blockade than before. Because this Italian ship was heading to a foreign port, the ships previously inspected were all ships returning to Italy from foreign ports, and the main purpose was to abduct Germans of military service age, and did not involve all passengers. From the standpoint of a neutral party, searching passengers in a neutral country's ship is like the British authorities exercising police power in neutral territory. (Haitong report, 24th)</p>
<h3>British Railway Workers' Union Resolution Urges Government to Stop the War: Believes the War Hinders Work Interests; Willing to Continue Fighting for Socialism</h3>
<p>London: The Essex group of the Railway Workers' Union passed a resolution yesterday demanding that the government quickly end the war against Germany. The resolution stated, "This union strongly condemns this imperialist war that harms the interests of our workers. We demand a quick end to the war and an international conference to discuss the economic needs of all countries and the fair distribution of fuel. We demand a referendum to resolve the issue of ethnic minorities. We demand an end to the political truce. Our leaders should continue to fight for socialism and fight for the people of all colonies, because only socialism can bring lasting peace to the world." Smith, Chairman of the National Committee of the Independent Labour Party, said in Nadderham yesterday that the current European war is "another evil struggle for power politics." The committee rejected the Railway Workers' Union's proposal, but agreed with the peace proposal, joining with neutral countries to make peace with Germany, restoring the independence of Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Poland, and ensuring that Germany will no longer stir up trouble when another international alliance or federation is formed. Smith also said, "Whether war or peace, I oppose Chamberlain's tenure." (United Press report, 24th)</p>

<p>The Soviet Union and the European War</p>
<h3>Written by Former Czech General Staff Colonel Moravec</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Airmail: Based on close observation of the military situation, this European war is completely different from the previous European war. Imperial Russia was an ally of Britain and France. From 1914 to 1917, Germany had to keep two-fifths of its troops on the Eastern Front. Before the collapse of Imperial Russia, Germany only had three-fifths of its troops to deal with the British and French forces. As a result of Germany's three-year war with Imperial Russia, the German army suffered more than one million casualties and prisoners. However, last year's German-Polish campaign lasted only one month, with only 14,000 casualties. When the German army attacked Amiens in March 1918, the German army had 40 divisions, which was about one-sixth of the total military strength, still stationed in Russia. Today, German officers do not need to station a large army in the east, nor do they need to station air and artillery troops for defense. For the sake of maintaining order in Poland, only the police and security teams are sufficient. Today's Soviet Union not only has no malice towards Germany, but also provides food, fuel, and minerals to help it. There is one more thing about this: the Soviet Union does not need to send troops to aid Germany. It only needs to exert pressure on places that are crucial to the interests of Britain and France, such as Iraq, Pakistan, and Syria, to be effective. Moreover, the Soviet Union faces the Pamir Plateau, which connects to the key points of British India. Is the Soviet Union expected to advance or retreat? In the previous European war, Britain and France had Imperial Russia as an ally and could dispatch troops from India, Africa, and Australia to attack Turkey. At the same time, Imperial Russia could also put pressure on Turkey from north to south, so the entrance to the Suez Canal and the Persian Gulf would not be threatened. If the Bohemian Basin can be called the center of Europe, then the area located between the five seas can be called the center of the ancient world. The five seas are the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Aegean Sea, the Red Sea, and the Arabian Sea. Today's Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Pakistan, Arabia, and the northern part of Iran are located in the area between the five seas. In this area, Britain not only possesses rich oil fields, but its air routes connecting the four continents of Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia also use this as a hub. In this area, if Britain loses its power, the fate of the British Empire will not be long, and the coming of bad luck can be counted on the days. Furthermore, Germany today only has one front and can concentrate all its forces in the Rhineland area, while Britain and France must take into account the safety of overseas colonies and naval bases, and they are exhausted and in danger. France must station troops in Tunis to prevent Italy, station troops in Morocco to prevent Spain, and station troops in Syria to strengthen Turkey's ability to resist the Soviet Union. Therefore, France cannot mobilize colonial soldiers to Europe to help in the war as it did in the past. The difficulties that Britain is encountering today are similar to those of France. Only a very small number of troops can be mobilized from India, and the fortresses in Iraq and Pakistan need to be reinforced. In 1915, the cavalry of Imperial Russia had already drunk water from the Tigris River. At that time, Germany and Russia were at odds, and the Russian army had to use five-sixths of its military strength to defend the German-Russian border. Now that the two countries have turned enemies into friends and have no worries, where will the Soviet army go if it goes south? How can it be said easily? France has a small population. If it loses another two million people in this war, it will no longer be able to dominate the ranks of the great powers. The war between France and Germany requires the help of the troops from the colonies of Britain and France, but because they are under pressure from the Soviet Union, Italy, and Spain, it is difficult to achieve their wishes. Therefore, they have to reluctantly place the heavy responsibility of defending the Maginot Line entirely on the shoulders of their own people. In short, the Soviet Union's benevolent neutrality not only caused the failure of Britain's blockade policy, but also made it difficult to concentrate the strength of the British and French forces. Germany's observation is like this, and knowledgeable people should not think it is nonsense. (Translated by Wang Shanshang)</p>

<h3>Norway Lodges Another Protest with the German Government, Demanding Punishment for Pilots Who Bombed Norwegian Ships; Denmark Also Prepares to Negotiate with Belligerent Nations</h3>
<p>Oslo - Following Norway's protest to Germany on March 8 against Germany's methods of naval warfare, Norway lodged another protest with the German government yesterday, demanding punishment for German pilots who recently machine-gunned and bombed two Norwegian merchant ships. The first Norwegian protest was issued regarding the incident on March 3 when the Norwegian ship "Leisekek" was strafed by a German plane, leaving the ship riddled with bullet holes but without injuries. The second note mentioned the German plane bombing the Norwegian ship "Brorodt" on March 1. This ship was later escorted by a lifeboat and sailed into a port on the east coast of England. As the crew lowered the lifeboat to escape, the German plane opened fire on them again. It is reported that seven crew members died as a result. (Reuter, 24th)</p>
<p>Norwegian Capital - The Norwegian ship "Dora Ellis" was attacked by a German plane on the 20th of this month, killing three crew members on the spot, with two others, including the captain, injured, one of whom is in critical condition. This has been confirmed by the captain, who stated that the ship was flying the Norwegian flag but was still bombed. In addition, the Norwegian Telegraphic News Agency reported that the Norwegian freighter "Lindoe" was also attacked by eight German planes on the 20th of this month, which dropped six bombs, all of which landed near the ship. According to one crew member, the German planes also machine-gunned him, but missed. A warship then arrived, opened fire with anti-aircraft guns, and drove away all the German planes. One of them seemed to have been badly damaged and probably could not fly back to its base. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Danjing - Well-informed sources say that the Danish government instructed its ambassadors to Britain and Germany on the 11th to make contact with the governments of their respective host countries in the hope of finding appropriate measures to ensure that Danish ships are no longer accidentally damaged due to naval warfare. However, six more Danish ships have recently been lost one after another. The external authorities are conducting a detailed investigation into the circumstances, and as soon as the results are obtained, they will negotiate again with the responsible belligerent party. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Danjing - The Social Democratic newspaper, which has close ties with the Danish government, commented today on the sinking of five or six Danish ships by German submarines in the past few days without warning, saying that Denmark felt particularly painful during this Easter. Before the British submarine sank the German ship "Hedderheim" off the coast of Denmark on March 21, it gave the crew a 15-minute warning. There is no need to compare with other incidents. We certainly acknowledge that Germany is currently at war with Britain, but we cannot accept this unfair form of warfare. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - After the Danish ships "Possehl" and "Viking" were recently sunk by German submarines with torpedoes, the country's ship "Christiansborg" was hit by a torpedo fired by a German submarine in the North Sea on the 20th of this month, killing one crew member. The rest have been rescued and have landed in a port in Scotland, one of whom has both legs broken and has been sent to the hospital for treatment. In addition, it is rumored that German planes flew over the eastern coast of Scotland today, seemingly to inspect the traffic of merchant ships at sea, but the Aviation Department has not received any information to confirm this. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Air Force Activity on the Franco-German Front; German Planes Continue Reconnaissance Over Britain</h3>
<p>Paris - The communiqué on the battles of the past 24 hours released here states that several strong German patrols approached the French line near the Barace River, and the French army repelled them without difficulty. The weather is more conducive to air activity, and both sides dispatched some aircraft, but no air battles were reported. British aircraft continued to patrol the North Sea, while French and German aircraft were active over the front line. Several French aircraft, protected by fighter planes, flew out to take photographs of German defenses and military targets, and repeatedly penetrated deep into German territory day and night, carrying out long- and medium-range reconnaissance flights. German aircraft were extremely active over the French lines in Alsace and carried out long-range reconnaissance flights in northern France. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command issued an official communiqué this afternoon stating that there were reconnaissance activities and artillery battles on the Western Front yesterday. Despite the abnormally bad weather, the German Air Force flew to eastern France for reconnaissance. Last night, several enemy planes flew to northern Germany for reconnaissance, and one Wellington aircraft was shot down by German anti-aircraft guns. (Haitong Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>London - Several planes, certainly from the enemy, approached the coast of Scotland yesterday, and their purpose was obviously to reconnoiter shipping routes. This is the third day that enemy aircraft have flown to Scotland for reconnaissance. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Aircraft Invade Danish and Dutch Territory</h3>
<p>Danjing - It is reported that a foreign aircraft flew low over the west of Totteland, machine-gunning five civilians working in the fields, but no one was injured. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Danjing - The Danish government dispatched officials to investigate the places where British aircraft dropped bombs. After two days of surveying, a report was written and will be submitted to the Danish Foreign Office. It is reported that in addition to dropping several bombs in Danish territory, British aircraft also dropped a large bomb in Tarum. (Haitong Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Bijing - The Ministry of National Defense has just issued a communiqué stating that the German Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur issued a message yesterday saying that several British or French aircraft had invaded Belgian airspace on the night of the 23rd of this month. According to the investigation by this Ministry, a foreign aircraft did invade the eastern airspace of this country at midnight on that day, but none of the border watchtowers were able to identify its nationality. One of the watchtowers reported that the aircraft belonged to Germany. As it was late at night, the country's air defense authorities had no certainty to determine this, and so it was reported to this Ministry as "nationality unknown." According to the country's practice, we are not willing to make conjectures without solid evidence. (Havas Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hejing - Several aircraft of unknown nationality flew over the Dutch cities of Arnhem and Urk between 11:00 pm and midnight last night. In addition, traces of these aircraft were also found over the northern provinces. Their direction was both from west to east and from east to west. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Advocates Building More Railways to Facilitate Eurasian Commercial Transport; Passenger Trains Between Lening and Viborg Have Resumed</h3>
<p>Moscow - An article in "Gudok," the mouthpiece of the Soviet Railway Commission, advocates building a railway from Baku to Maqushkara in the Caucasus. If this plan can be realized, the route and time for Soviet oil to reach Germany can be greatly shortened. The article also advocates extending the existing railway from Gurguf to Kandagas to Vorosk. After this route is completed, the route from Baku to Siberia or Central Asia can be shortened by more than 1,000 kilometers, which will have a major impact on commercial transportation. (Haitong Agency, 24th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The government has just announced that the railway from Lening City to Viborg Port (formerly belonging to Finland) will resume passenger trains starting tomorrow, twice a day. In addition, telegraph and telephone communications between the two places will also be gradually restored. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Diplomats from Various Countries Stationed in Warsaw Ordered to Leave by the Germans</h3>
<p>Bijing - The semi-official Belgian News Agency has just received a message from Berlin stating that several diplomats from various countries are still in the city of Warsaw, and have been notified by the German authorities in Poland that the Polish war ended several months ago. Since then, all diplomatic affairs have been handled entirely by the German government. Diplomats from various countries should leave Poland, and seats have been reserved for them on the train departing tonight. (Havas Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Indian Muslim Association Passes Constitution; Provinces with Muslim Majority Should Be Treated as Independent Countries</h3>
<p>Lahore - Representatives from 40 Indian states attended the founding conference of the All-India States Muslim Association. The organization of the Association includes people from various states, but it is not within the scope of the activities of the All-India Muslim League. The congress passed a constitution identical to that proposed by the All-India Muslim League and decided that constitutional reforms in various states must be discussed with Muslims before implementation. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Lahore - The Resolutions Committee of the Indian Muslim Congress today passed a resolution to be submitted to the Annual Congress for consideration, reiterating that the federal method stipulated in the recent Indian Autonomy Act is completely unsuitable for India and cannot be implemented. It also stated that Indian provinces with a Muslim majority should be treated as independent countries, with effective guarantees attached to protect minorities. This is a fundamental principle, and any constitution not based on this fundamental principle is unacceptable to Muslims. The resolution authorized the Working Committee to formulate a constitutional outline in accordance with this principle and stipulated that each independent region should have full power over national defense, diplomacy, transportation, and customs.

<h3>Irish Republican Army Creates Havoc in Prison, Beating Jailers and Setting Fires; Police Suppression Quickly Subdues Situation</h3>
<p>London - The Irish Republican Army in Dartmoor Prison in England took advantage of the opportunity when there were fewer jailers on Saturday and Sunday to beat prison staff and set fires. Suddenly, there was a lot of noise. The jailers rushed to the prison upon hearing the alarm, driving the troublemakers back into their cells and trying to put out the fire. After about two hours, the fire was extinguished. The roof of the cell block where the Irish Republican Army was detained had been burned through. When the news of the incident first came out, everyone suspected it was a large-scale prison escape. Police from nearby districts immediately came to assist, and the prison was immediately placed on alert. After the fire was extinguished, everything returned to normal. According to the Home Office, a small number of Irish Republicans were causing trouble in the prison, setting fires, but the damage was minimal. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3>The Appearance of the Puppet Central Government; Overview of the Situation in Nanjing; The Puppet Central Government Cannot Control North China</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the mainland newspaper on March 20 from Nanjing stated: "The Central Political Conference" held its first meeting here this morning and will pass resolutions previously decided upon, and Chinese "officials" will hand over the occupied areas to the "government" organized by Chinese "officials." However, the heavy secrecy surrounding the conference has increased the curiosity of the city's Chinese residents. The population of Nanjing before the war was about one million, but it is now only half of that number. Although five-color flags are still hung in many places, the number of small "officials" wearing the blue sky with a white sun badge is increasing daily, and the blue sky with a white sun badge is also prominently displayed on the windshields of public cars. The public is confused as to why, and this point has not been explained in detail. Nanjing is still a world of soldiers. The so-called post-war reconstruction consists only of simple houses, providing only shelter from the wind and rain, without any plans for future development. Two-story buildings have been built on both sides of the main roads, with relatively high-rise banks interspersed among them, which look sturdy, but only on the outside, with rubble still in the back. The desolate scene reminds one of Zhabei in Shanghai. Although a Japanese division is stationed throughout the city, it is rarely seen. They are all stationed in solidly built barracks, and those seen on the streets are stationed in concrete fortifications at intersections. It is rumored that these Japanese troops will soon be transferred to Wuhu, so that the "new government" will have the false appearance of being able to manage its own destiny, but there is no evidence to confirm this rumor. What the "Political Conference" announced yesterday was that Chinese industries currently under Japanese control would be returned to Chinese administration, but the progress of this move would be quite slow. If this statement cannot be implemented, the "new government" will be hampered from the beginning, unless Wang Jingwei can deliver on his promises and not just make empty talk. Then, the people under Wang's rule will see no difference between Wang and the Japanese army. Thirty representatives gathered at the International Club this morning to pass resolutions previously decided upon and automatically promote the establishment of a new "government." The "Political Conference" is currently convened in accordance with the "constitutional" provisions and must pass several important resolutions before adjourning. One of the resolutions is to liquidate the two "temporary" and "reformed" "governments." According to visitors from Beiping, the "new government" will nominally control North China at most, except for foreign relations. There are currently at least 900 military police from Beiping in the city of Nanjing, and it is expected that another 1,500 will arrive here within days. In terms of domestic forecasts, this may be of great significance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Tired of War Commit Suicide in Jiaozhi Town, Suzhou; Tang Dynasty Sculptures of Arhats Safe and Sound</h3>
<p>A correspondent in Suzhou reported that more than 60 soldiers of the Goto Detachment of the Japanese army are stationed at Baosheng Temple on Nanjie Street in Jiaozhi Town, this county. On the morning of the 16th of this month, the Japanese army there suddenly received orders to go to eastern Zhejiang to fight. When the roll was called at the time of departure, it was discovered that one soldier was missing. The Japanese officer in charge of the team initially thought that he had gone out shopping and had not returned. By about 9:00, he was still nowhere to be seen, and he became suspicious. He immediately ordered his subordinates to search in all directions. As a result, he was found in the firewood room in the temple, lying on the ground in a suicide attempt, barely breathing. The Japanese military doctor diagnosed him and determined that the poisoning was deep and beyond saving. The Japanese soldier soon died.</p>
<p>Also, the Tang Dynasty sculptures of Arhats in the town, which were previously rumored to have been shipped to Japan, are confirmed to be safe and sound and are being properly cared for by the town. Strong iron fences have been built around them, and they are locked to prevent damage.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Circles Commemorate Yu Manto; National Government Orders Posthumous Recognition; Lawyers' Association Plans Memorial Stele; Five Hundred Attendees Reflect Utmost Honor; Yu's Remains Scheduled for Burial at Jing'an Temple Cemetery on the 27th</h3>
<p>After Yu Manto, Criminal Division Chief of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court in Shanghai, was murdered in the line of duty on November 23rd of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Lawyers' Association, the Dangyang Sojourners Association in Shanghai, and leaders from all walks of life in this city held a memorial service at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 500 representatives from all walks of life attended. The general assembly resolved to petition the National Government for posthumous recognition. Yu's remains are scheduled to be buried at the Jing'an Temple Cemetery on the 27th of this month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Solemn Atmosphere at the Venue</p>
<p>The four walls of the memorial service venue were hung with elegiac couplets, creating a solemn atmosphere. Yu's portrait was hung high above the stage, radiant and awe-inspiring. Yu's posthumous calligraphy and poetry were also hung on both sides of the entrance to the venue. Those who attended deeply mourned upon seeing his posthumous works. Above Yu's portrait hung a white cloth banner from the Lawyers' Association that read "Sacrificed Life for Law." Among the elegiac couplets hanging on the four walls were those from Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan, Xie Guansheng, Minister of Justice Administration, and various groups in this city. In particular, the elegiac couplet from Yu's younger brother, Mr. Dafu, was especially striking. The couplet read, "Heaven ruins the talented Wang Lang, integrity is seen in times of adversity, each with a clear reputation that spread throughout the country. Heaven and earth support justice. The spirit grieves for two nights, relying on blood debts to settle Liaodong." The wording was impassioned, sad, and extremely moving. The seats in the venue were divided into left and right sections, with the left section for female guests and the right section for male guests, totaling more than 300 people.</p>
<p>Memorial Circumstances</p>
<p>The presidium of the memorial service included Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Wen Lanting, Xu Jiyi, Chen Shichang, Jin Tingsun, Ru Baoyi, Liu Shaokui, Xu Zuoliang, Wu Zhengzhuo, Yuan Yang'an, and others. The memorial ceremony was quite solemn. After playing mourning music, the chief officiant, Yu Qiaqing, and the assistant officiants, Wen Lanting, Xu Jiyi, Yuan Ludeng, and Du Kanghou, took their places one after another. Next, the chief officiant offered flowers. Lin Kanghou and Xu Zuoliang read the memorial oration. Then, everyone stood at attention and bowed three times. Next, Jiang Baqian reported on Yu's life. Chen Tingrui delivered a eulogy and discussed permanent memorial measures, including the Lawyers' Association's construction of a memorial stele to commemorate Yu's martyrdom. It was also decided to telegraph the National Government for posthumous recognition. Finally, Yu's wife delivered a speech of thanks, and the ceremony was concluded.</p>
<p>Central Government's Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>According to reporters investigating with the memorial preparation committee, after Chief Judge Yu was murdered in the line of duty in Shanghai, the central government expressed deep condolences. President Chiang telegraphed condolences to the family and provided a pension of 10,000 yuan. Yu's eldest son, Yu Minfang, went to study in the United States last year and will also be given official funding by the central government to complete his studies. This demonstrates the authorities' care for the bereaved family. Yu had two sons and four daughters. The eldest daughter has completed her university studies and is now working in the cultural field in Hong Kong. The others are still young and studying in Shanghai. Yu's remains will be buried on the 27th of this month. The memorial preparation committee announced that Yu Manto will be buried at the Jing'an Temple Road Cemetery (end of Foch Road) at 3:00 PM on the 27th of this month. All those who knew Yu well and wish to attend the ceremony are invited to come to the cemetery at that time.</p>
<p>Request for Posthumous Recognition</p>
<p>The request for posthumous recognition reads: "To Chairman Lin of the Chongqing National Government, Shanghai Jiangsu High Court Second Branch Criminal Division Chief Yu, has served in Shanghai for eight years. His reputation is widely praised. He was suddenly murdered in the line of duty on November 23rd. His integrity was awe-inspiring. The tragedy of his death is unprecedented in the judicial community since the war of resistance. Upon investigation, this deceased Chief Judge served as a judicial officer for nearly thirty years, known for his integrity and impartiality. He served as a law professor at various universities in the north and south, as well as at the Judicial Training Institute and Chucun Hall. He educated numerous students throughout the country. His contributions to cultivating talent are indelible. Throughout his life, he was filial to his parents and fraternal to his brothers. His ordinary virtues and actions are worthy of admiration. All the details of his death in the line of duty and his life's achievements have been submitted in detail by his family and should be reviewed. Various circles in Shanghai jointly held a memorial meeting on the 24th of this month to express their condolences, demonstrating the depth of public grief. We, Qiaqing and others, have witnessed this and are deeply in awe. Having witnessed this deceased Chief Judge sacrifice himself for the country, we cannot remain silent. Therefore, we earnestly request that you approve a clear order for posthumous recognition and generous compensation, and that his death in the line of duty and his life's achievements be proclaimed in the national history, to comfort his loyal soul and encourage future generations. We await your orders with utmost trepidation. Respectfully submitted by Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Lawyers' Association, Fuyang Sojourners Association in Shanghai, acting Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Xu Jiyi, Xu Zuoliang, and others."</p>
<p>Memorial Oration</p>
<p>On the 24th day of the third month of the 29th year of the Republic of China, Yu Qiaqing and others respectfully offer this simple memorial offering to the spirit of Yu Manto, saying: "Alas, our esteemed Yu, a national scholar, heroic and outstanding, with pure virtue in his person. Born in Dangyang, endowed with spiritual beauty, having completed the Confucian classics, he extensively studied in the Pan Palace. In his youthful years, he traveled to the east of the sea, studying law with great precision, his reputation filled the world. As an old officer of the Han court, he was a model of lectures, educating talents with great joy. His equal-weight writings have the same merit as Han and Shang. His poetry and prose are elegant, succeeding Fang Weng. His paintings excel in landscapes, following Da Chi. He was benevolent in heart, treating all things equally. He enforced the law without bias, being just and honest. Encountering a world in turmoil, his five internal organs felt disturbed. Although he had the intention to retreat, he still upheld his steadfastness, unafraid of power, and fearless of the Rong soldiers. He sacrificed his life for righteousness, leaving a lasting reputation. With the beam broken, who will support the mansion? A teacher of law, literature, and art for later students, we pay tribute and offer sacrifices, our tears flowing silently. His heroic spirit is unwavering, eliminating violence and ensuring safety. Alas, alas! Please accept this offering." The Lawyers' Association's memorial oration is omitted.</p>
<p>Wife's Memorial Oration</p>
<p>On the 24th day of the third month of the 29th year of the Republic of China, the widow Chen Yin tearfully offers this simple offering to the spirit of my husband, Manto, saying: "Alas, my husband, unfortunately, was suddenly assassinated. Without leaving a word, he departed forever. Alas, how painful! The karmic connection in this life has been severed, and there is no hope of reunion in the next. Separated forever by life and death, my heart and liver are torn apart. My husband's life was pure and selfless, frugal in building a family, and dutiful to his parents and siblings. Since the national crisis, our family has been unfortunate. First, my mother-in-law was killed, and now my husband has sacrificed his life. How cruel is heaven to our Yu family? I hate that the murderers have not been brought to justice and lament that national law cannot be upheld. Sacrificing his life in blood only won him fair public opinion. How can I not be sad? Recalling the past, under the lamp by the window, in the autumn of banana sounds and night rain, you said that although heaven and earth are vast, we two are dependent on each other. You deeply wished to relinquish the responsibility of a judge, retire to our hometown, assist society, improve production occupations, and popularize women's education. You enjoyed poetry and painting, while I enjoyed photography and planting flowers. Among famous mountains and rivers, there were always traces of our two travels. These feelings and words are vividly before my eyes. How long ago was it that it all turned into bubbles? Now that you have sacrificed your life, it is not difficult for me to sacrifice my life for you. Considering that the children are still young, raising and educating them are the responsibilities of those who remain. Why take one's life lightly to follow you? I can only steal a breath in this world,勉力抚孤，以慰君灵于地下。君如有灵、来歆来格、呜呼哀哉、伏维尚飨、</p>

<h3>工部局董事選舉　日方提出要求　一再向費利浦提出交涉　結果增日監票助手二人</h3>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) Board of Directors Election: The Japanese side made demands and repeatedly negotiated with Mr. Fessenden, resulting in the addition of two Japanese assistant poll watchers.</p>
<p>The results of the Municipal Council's current Board of Directors election and the British community candidates' primary election have been announced. The elected members are H.E. Hale, K. J. Tweedy, Mitchell, Rotherick McDonald, and Powell. The American community candidate, Arroman, Karna, McDonald, is in the midst of voting, with results expected to be announced on the 26th. Regarding the five Chinese directors, there is talk of re-election. As for the issue of the number of Japanese directors, the Japanese side has used the increase in the Japanese population as an excuse to demand an increase, which has not yet been resolved. This matter has attracted considerable attention from all parties. According to an announcement from the Japanese side, the Municipal Council has made concessions regarding this election law due to the Japanese side's seven demands. According to the Japanese side's account of the negotiations, on the 19th of this month, Mr. Hayashi, the current chairman of the various Japanese Associations, raised the following seven conditions during a visit to Mr. Fessenden: (1) Due to the sharp increase in the number of Japanese residents with voting rights, one of the two election committee members in charge of this year's election should be Japanese. (2) Based on the above reason, this one election committee member (i.e., the poll watcher) should be selected from among the Japanese. (3) To guide Japanese residents who do not comply with the election rules, Japanese instructors selected by the Japanese community should be responsible for guidance at the polling place. (4) To ensure the accurate receipt of Japanese residents' voting certificates, the Japanese Residents' Association should collect and distribute them in full, without the Municipal Council mailing them out. (5) Due to the increase in the number of voters, the election time should be extended. (6) The names of the Japanese director candidates should be recorded in Japanese in addition to English on the ballots. (7) Japanese residents should be allowed to write their ballots in Japanese. At that time, Mr. Fessenden agreed to the third, sixth, and seventh articles, but for the first article, he only allowed Japanese residents to serve as assistants. For the second article, he said that the two members of the election committee had already been determined to be Norwegian Mr. Bertel and Swedish Mr. Bringer. For the fourth article, he said that it was still appropriate to mail them to each voter and could not be entrusted to the Japanese Residents' Association for collection. For the fifth article, he said that the Land Regulations had already stipulated and could not be changed. The Japanese representatives believed that the Municipal Council's response was unsatisfactory, and on the 21st, Consul General Miura met with Mr. Fessenden to discuss the matter. As a result, Mr. Fessenden expressed his willingness to comply with the fourth and sixth articles and agreed that the Japanese community would select two assistants to assist the election committee. As for the number of Japanese directors, there is currently no indication whether the Japanese side can abide by the "gentleman's agreement" of the British, American, and Japanese ratio of 5:2:2.</p>
<h3>英僑候選人履歷</h3>
<p>British Community Candidates' Biographical Information</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the results of the Municipal Council's Board of Directors election and the British community candidates' primary election, the outside world expressed its approval. The reason is that the elected individuals are all experienced in the work of the Municipal Council. The biographies of each of the elected candidates are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Hale: Manager of Imperial Chemical Industries, Ltd., has been in China for over thirty years. He has been serving as a director of the Municipal Council since last year.</p>
<p>(2) McDonald: Manager of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd., has been in China for thirty-eight years. He has been serving as a director of the Municipal Council since 1937.</p>
<p>(3) Mitchell: Came to China in 1900 and was appointed as a director of the Municipal Council in 1935. He served again in 1938 and the first half of 1939.</p>
<p>(4) Powell: Although the least experienced of the five elected candidates, he made significant contributions during his time at the Municipal Council last year and received widespread praise.</p>
<p>(5) Tweedy: The current Deputy Chairman of the Municipal Council, he was first appointed as a director of the Municipal Council in 1936 and was re-elected in 1938.</p>
<h3>棉織業職工會　昨開成立大會</h3>
<p>Cotton Textile Workers' Union held its inaugural meeting yesterday.</p>
<p>The entire body of workers from undershirt and sanitary shirt factories in this city organized the Cotton Textile Workers' Association, which held its inaugural meeting yesterday. Over 900 members attended, passing the constitution and discussing proposals: (1) To continue to re-establish standard wages based on the plan determined at the preparatory meeting, to restore piecework wages to the original state of 1933, and to request a double increase for hourly wages to provide financial assistance. Resolved and passed. (2) Labor savings should be implemented, and the employer should be asked to assist in the process. Resolved and passed. (3) Member job placement should continue according to the original plan. Resolved and passed. (4) Providing medical treatment, medicine, emergency loans, compulsory education, and all welfare matters should be expedited. Resolved. According to Article 15 of the constitution, a board of directors was organized, and it was decided on the spot to hire Shen Yaoting, Wang Haicheng, and He Xianli as directors. (5) Approved the declaration. Finally, the election results were announced, and He Xianjun, Yang Youcai, Zhang Xichang, Shi Heguang, Xue Liangcai, Wang Zhiban, Lu Fudi, Wang Hejin, Mao Dafu, Li Genlin, Qiu Wenxuan, Zhang Xianyu, Changsheng, Lu Laisheng, and Zhu Zhenbin were elected as executive committee members. Ji Zhongqing, Xu Zhibin, Xie Fusheng, Su Guan, and Xu Rongchun were elected as supervisory committee members. The declaration stated briefly that the wages of our cotton textile workers have been reduced by two-tenths over the years. On the contrary, the standard of living has continued to rise. The difference between the past and the present is more than several times. Workers are forced to bear an increasing burden of inverse proportionality. For the sake of livelihood, we should ask the employer to restore the original wages for piecework and to increase the wages for hourly work by double, which has not yet been resolved. Looking at the wages of various countries in the world, they all change with the social environment and standard of living to stabilize the livelihood of workers. Even the regulations on minimum wages in our country's factory law are based on the living conditions of workers in each factory location. Especially since the price increase, many employers in various industries have automatically increased wages, with many previous examples. We ask people from all walks of life to uphold justice and show sympathetic assistance so that this case can be resolved as soon as possible and maintain the spirit of labor-management coordination.</p>
<h3>麵館業呈請　撥給平麵</h3>
<p>Noodle Shop Industry Petitions for Allocation of Affordable Flour</p>
<p>More than one hundred noodle shops in this city have jointly petitioned the guild because they are unable to maintain their business after the suspension of affordable flour, which has a significant impact on the social livelihood.

<h3>郵政局恢復　海門本口包裹</h3>
<p>Postal Bureau Resumes Acceptance of Parcels to Haimen</p>
<p>Haimen, Jiangsu, previously experienced unstable local conditions, traffic congestion, and sluggish transportation, resulting in the de facto extension of delivery times for mail sent from Shanghai to that area. Also, bulky mail such as parcels was temporarily suspended. Now, because the local situation has gradually improved and shipping is gradually becoming smoother, the parcel business department of the Shanghai Postal Administration has resumed accepting large parcels to Haimen from today. It is reported that Erjia, Jinsha, Juegang, and Pinchai are still temporarily suspended from accepting parcels.</p>
<h3>中國西南實業協會建議　救濟上海工業辦法　飭四行擴大貼放組貸款銀團　實施便利內滙辦法准請申滙</h3>
<p>China Southwest Industrial Association Suggests Ways to Rescue Shanghai Industry: Order the Four Banks to Expand Discounted Loans, Organize Loan Syndicates, Implement Convenient Internal Remittance Methods, and Approve Applications for Remittance.</p>
<p>The China Southwest Industrial Association suggests ways to rescue Shanghai's national industry: (1) The central financial and economic administrative authorities should send responsible personnel to Shanghai to investigate the current production and sales situation and internal organization of each factory in conjunction with various public organizations to understand the true situation. (2) The central financial authorities should supervise the joint office of the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Agricultural Bank of China, and the Central Bank of China to notify their branches in the interior and Shanghai that they should make every effort to handle and implement the interim measures for facilitating internal remittances approved by the Ministry of Finance for factories that have been identified in the previous item and have accurate proof, so as to ensure thoroughness. (3) The central financial authorities should order the four banks' discount committee to expand the amount of discounts for Shanghai industry, encourage commercial banks to jointly handle industrial loans, or organize industrial loan syndicates to underwrite loans to factories that are solid in content and have reliable guarantees. At the same time, the four banks' discount committee and the Shanghai Bankers' Joint Preparatory Association should be ordered to act as a backing for commercial banks by means of refinancing, so that funds can be used properly or speculative activities can be suppressed. (4) Please ask chambers of commerce and other organizations to organize joint industrial groups to handle matters such as investigating and identifying the content and production and sales of various factories for the government and the financial community to consult, handle remittance applications, and review loans, which can be more convenient. (5) Shanghai factories that transport and sell goods to Hong Kong and Nanyang should settle and sell foreign exchange to the four banks in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's measures for exporting goods and selling foreign exchange to increase the government's foreign exchange income.</p>
<h3>槍殺程克光　兇手名周洪生　候傷愈偵查再行究辦</h3>
<p>Cheng Ke-guang Assassinated: The Assassin's Name is Zhou Hongsheng, He Will Be Investigated and Prosecuted After He Recovers from His Injuries.</p>
<p>Cheng Ke-guang, a 35-year-old Hangzhou native who lived at No. 5 Jiande Lane, Yuyue Road, an extraterritorial road in western Shanghai, and worked as an executive at the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, was celebrating his father's birthday at the Juelin Vegetable Restaurant at No. 254 Avenue Joffre on the 22nd, hosting a banquet for guests. At 8 p.m. that night, Cheng was sending guests to the entrance of Juelin when he was suddenly shot and attacked by thugs. Cheng was hit by five bullets in the head and chest, all in vital parts. He immediately fell to the ground and died. After receiving the report, the police took the body to the mortuary on Telasto Road for examination. The next day, they reported to the Second District Court and appointed a prosecutor to come to the office to clarify the matter. Cheng's wife, Mrs. Cheng Li, made a conclusion and took the body for burial. It is learned that at the time of the incident, Patrolman No. 1180, who was on guard at the scene, heard the gunshots and rushed to pursue the suspect. He saw a person running wildly north on Ge Luo Road. The patrolman tried his best to catch up. After the suspect discovered that there was a patrolman chasing him, he drew his gun and opened fire to the rear to resist arrest. Unexpectedly, the bullet jammed. The Chinese patrolman also drew his gun and returned fire. The suspect fled to the front of No. 7 Foch Road, fell to the ground after being shot, and was captured. The gun was taken away and taken back to the police station. According to the suspect's confession, his name was Zhou Hongsheng, 28 years old, from Changzhou. Seeing that he was injured, the police chief ordered him to be sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. He will be investigated and interrogated by the court after he recovers from his injuries.</p>
<h3>錫滬路上　商人被綁</h3>
<p>Merchant Kidnapped on the Shanghai-Wuxi Road</p>
<p>Wu Wensheng from Anhui used to be a partner at Xiao Chunlin's dry tobacco shop in Shatou Town, Taicang. After August 13th, Wu raised funds and took over the shop, renaming it Chunlin Guang Tobacco, Paper, and Tea Shop. The business was very prosperous, so Wu accumulated a large fortune and successively purchased land in the town, which aroused the covetousness of bandits. A month ago, his son was kidnapped by bandits on the way to school. As a result, Wu redeemed him for more than one hundred yuan. Recently, Wu came to Shanghai to purchase goods. On the 22nd, he took the "China Company" long-distance bus from Shanghai back to Taicang. Unexpectedly, the bus was kidnapped and taken off the bus between Waigang and Gelong Town on the Shanghai-Wuxi Road. His whereabouts are unknown.</p>
<h3>強盜殺人案　重開辯論</h3>
<p>Robbery and Murder Case: Debate Reopened</p>
<p>Luo Qiaoxin, a 45-year-old woman living at No. 432 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, was broken into by robbers at 2 p.m. on November 27th of last year. She was strangled to death with a rope, and cash and gold were stolen, with the total valuables more than yuan, before the robbers escaped. It was not until 4 p.m. that her son, Shunde, returned home from school and discovered the crime, reporting it to the French police and requesting an investigation. The Criminal Investigation Department of the Public Security Bureau arrested four suspects: Gao Changdang (a former servant of the deceased who was dismissed for some reason) from Jiangbei, Shen Bingrong, Li San, and the suspected woman Ma Guoshi. After being sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation, it was found that Ma Guoshi had no involvement and was not prosecuted. The court was requested to release her. The French Concession's administrative authorities' lawyer prosecuted Gao, Shen, and Li on charges of robbery and murder. According to Gao's confession, the crime was committed with the involvement of Bureau Chief Cai and Minister Rong, who strangled the victim. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The case was originally investigated and concluded, and a verdict was scheduled to be announced. However, Judge Miao, who was presiding over the case, believed that the case still had unclear aspects. For the sake of caution, a more detailed investigation was needed to avoid injustice. Therefore, on the scheduled date of the verdict, the defendants were ordered to be brought to the case and the conclusion of the debate was revoked. A retrial was scheduled, and the debate was reopened. The defendants were returned to custody pending review.</p>

<p>At Chang Le Shao Xing Theater at No. 115 Haig Road, Xujiahui, at around 8 p.m. the night before last, the performance was in progress.

<h3>中國科學社　昨追悼蔡孑民氏　並經決定永久紀念辦法</h3>
<p>China Science Society Mourned Cai Yuanpei Yesterday and Decided on Permanent Memorial Measures</p>
<p>After the death of Cai Yuanpei in Hong Kong, the president of the Academia Sinica, the China Science Society of this city, held a public memorial service and memorial meeting at the Society's headquarters on Albert Road at 2 p.m. yesterday because Cai was the chairman of the Society and made great contributions to the Society. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A glimpse of the auditorium: A white cloth banner was hung at the entrance of the China Science Society, with the words "Memorial Meeting for Chairman Cai." A half-mast flag was hung on the roof to express condolences. The memorial meeting was held in the auditorium on the second floor of the Society. A portrait of Cai was placed in the center, surrounded by green cypress and flowers. There were flowers and incense on the offering table. Dozens of wreaths were placed in front of the offering table, and the four walls were decorated with mourning couplets. The layout was extremely simple.</p>
<p>Visitors filled the door: Although the weather was continuously rainy yesterday, many members of the Society and guests came to mourn. The members included He Dekui, Gu Dingmei, Hu Dunfu, Sun Hongfen, Cao Huiqun, Yang Xuehuan, He Bingsong, Pan Xulun, Yang Shuxun, Song Wusheng, and Fang Ziwei. There were about one hundred guests. The chief officiants were Hu Dunfu, representing the Board of Directors, Sun Hongfen, representing the Council, and Cao Huiqun, representing the Shanghai Social Friends. Hu Dunfu was the chairman of the memorial meeting.</p>
<p>Memorial ceremony: The public memorial service and memorial service began at 2 p.m. Order: (1) Public memorial service: The chief officiants took their places, the whole body stood in silence, bowed three times to the portrait of Mr. Cai Yuanpei, remained silent, presented wreaths, played music, read the memorial text, the whole body sat down and played music. (2) The chairman of the memorial meeting delivered the opening speech, speeches, proposals, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech: After the public memorial service was completed according to the above order, the memorial service began. Chairman Hu Dunfu gave a speech, stating briefly that Mr. Cai's articles and morality were admired by the world, and that he would not repeat them. Mr. Cai reached the peak in Sinology at an early age, and his philosophical research also had insights. He had a thorough understanding of various academic thoughts and immersed himself in research. He was by no means satisfied with a little superficial knowledge. He advocated promoting aesthetic education and promoting all education and culture. He was the highest ideal for the number of people. Chinese scholars, such as those who are well-versed in old learning, often become rigid and cannot learn from the past. Those who have made achievements in new learning often tend to be extreme. There are also those who are too subjective and have eyes higher than their heads. This kind of thing does not help academic culture. Only Mr. Cai can be inclusive. He presided over Peking University. From the old to the royalists, the new to the anarchists, he advocated lecturing and learning freely. His thoughts can keep pace with the times and never lag behind. He was very generous to younger students, and he treated people with sincerity.</p>
<p>Guest Speech: Then Cai's old friend Gu Dingmei gave a speech, briefly describing his friendship with Cai for 40 years and praising Cai's meticulous scholarship. Then He Bingsong took the stage to express his views. He said that Cai's founding of Peking University was a major turning point in the Chinese national revival movement. Cai's life had several characteristics: (1) He was humble and never felt satisfied with his own knowledge. (2) He followed the thoughts of the times and never gave up. (3) He was kind to others and could tolerate all things. (4) He devoted himself to the four words of academic salvation of the country until his death. Then Yang, Gu Hongfen, Cao Huiqun, and others gave speeches.</p>
<p>Permanent Commemoration: After the speeches, Yang Xiaoshu, the secretary-general of the Society, stood up and described Cai's achievements to the Society during his lifetime. The preparatory committee proposed permanent commemoration measures. The Nanjing Institute of Biology, which Cai loved very much, was destroyed by fire in the current war. It is proposed to rebuild it at a higher price, just like the "Mingfu Library" to benefit the academic community. This suggestion will be submitted to the Council for approval. The chairman also solicited the opinions of the members on other commemoration methods and asked them to submit them to the Council for discussion in writing. The meeting then adjourned.</p>

All school-age children aged six to twelve throughout the country, except those who can receive six-year primary education, should receive four, two, or one year of compulsory education in accordance with this outline. Out-of-school citizens aged fifteen to forty-five throughout the country should receive primary or advanced supplementary education for citizens in stages in accordance with this outline. However, priority should be given to implementing this for men and women aged fifteen to thirty-five, and then gradually extending it to older citizens.

If there are no schools, they should be established in stages according to the provisions of the previous article. Existing private primary schools in the area may maintain their original status, but if the local area cannot establish schools due to financial reasons, private primary schools may be designated and subsidized to serve as substitute central schools or national schools. Improved private schools in the area may be designated by the national school to handle one- or two-year completion classes. Citizen schools attached to local agencies and organizations should continue to operate. Article 6: Each province and city should complete a survey of the number of school-age children and out-of-school citizens in each "bao" in their jurisdiction within six months after the implementation of this outline, create statistical tables, and submit them to the Ministry of Education. Article 7: Each province and city should approve the plan for the phased establishment of national schools in their jurisdiction within four months after the implementation of this outline. In the second phase, national schools must be evenly distributed within every three "bao" or two "bao".

<h3>Children's Day Preparatory Committee Specifies Carnival Procedures and Notifies All Units That Prior Notification to the Police Authorities Is Required</h3>
<p>In the past, various schools and child welfare organizations in this city held speeches, celebrations, and large-scale group parades on the Fourth of April Children's Day.

The committee has notified all schools and child welfare organizations in this city accordingly. Also, according to reports, the Children's Day Preparatory Committee, considering that there are still more than 20,000 impoverished children in Shanghai, has specially decided on a method for soliciting gifts, sending letters to all sectors of society requesting donations of 20,000 gifts to be distributed on Children's Day to express condolences. The original letter soliciting donations from the committee is excerpted below: Respectfully, recent investigations have revealed that there are still more than 20,000 orphaned and impoverished children in Shanghai.

<h3>International Cup Soccer Final: Chinese Team Should File a Protest</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Western Newspapers Unanimously Condemned the Referee</p>
<p>In the International Cup soccer final the day before yesterday, the Chinese team suffered a bitter 2-3 defeat due to a ridiculous and nonsensical penalty kick awarded by the referee. Yesterday, various Western newspapers, including the "North-China Daily News," "The Shanghai Times," and the "China Press," published news reports condemning this penalty. This shows that Chinese and Western people on the scene shared the same view. Although the award has already been given, the Chinese team should immediately file a protest in order to clarify the truth. Whether or not it is established is another matter, but it shows that someone cares. The so-called evidence is the reports in yesterday's newspapers, which are ironclad evidence. What do the authorities think?</p>
<h3>Today's Scott Cup Final: Lido vs. Portuguese Businessmen, Starts at 3 PM at the Canidrome, Rain or Shine</h3>
<p>The 1939-40 Scott Cup Football Championship, after three months of fierce competition, will see Lido face off against Portuguese Businessmen in the final. The match was originally scheduled for the day before yesterday, but unexpectedly, Lido's Gao Huaide was assassinated and seriously injured on the eve of the match, so the date was temporarily changed. It was decided that they would meet today at the Canidrome. However, it is the Qingming Festival, and the spring rain is incessant, which is a pity. The Western organizers, in order to end the season as soon as possible, have decided not to postpone it again. They will compete today despite the rain. The Chinese athletes, having had their within-reach International Cup championship ruined the day before yesterday due to an unwarranted penalty kick, will borrow from the spirit of Yue Fei and fight with their backs to the wall with a spirit of determination. In order to commemorate Mr. Gao Huaide, the late chairman, for his founding of the Lido Sports Association, in addition to wearing black armbands, they have also negotiated with the organizers to stand in silence for one minute before the game to express their condolences. The starting lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Lido Association</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen</p>
<p>Li Yichen, Zhang Linggen</p>
<p>Yan Shixin, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang</p>

<h3>Old News Re-Copied: 67 Years Ago, From Our Paper of the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>The Situation of Money</p>
<p>In ancient times, people traded at midday, exchanging grains for tools and goods for goods. There was no need for currency, so the rulers and ministers of ancient times did not concern themselves with matters of currency. During the rise of the Zhou dynasty, Taigong created the Nine Offices, and currency began to be used in transactions. During the Han dynasty, in addition to coin-knives, springs, and silks, five-zhu coins were cast. By the Song dynasty, coins were cast with the reign titles of each emperor. The events before the Song and Yuan dynasties will not be discussed in detail. Only the events of the Ming dynasty will be discussed. During the Hongwu reign, financial resources were already insufficient. After the use of banknotes, they were repeatedly abolished and restored. The casting of coins was also stopped and started from time to time, which led to the uprising of bandits and the lack of national resources during the Chongzhen reign. As a result, various levies were created, and taxes were increased every year. However, taxes come from farmers, and farmers come from the land. If the land cannot be cultivated, only the circumstances are considered for taxation, which leads to the impoverishment of the people, who become bandits and destroy the dynasty. After the fall of the Ming dynasty, the princes, nobles, meritorious officials, and cabinet officials each presented their gold and silver to the bandit camps, amounting to countless millions, while copper coins were not considered very valuable. When Emperor Sizong was raising funds, his father-in-law Zhou Kui and chief minister Chen Yan only contributed 100 taels of gold to Emperor Sizong, but they gave millions to the bandits. After our dynasty established itself, silver was increasingly exported and copper coins were increasingly cast. By the Yongzheng and Qianlong reigns, the silver treasury was full and copper coins were abundant. By the Daoguang reign, it was not as prosperous as before. At this time, the silver mines in Yunnan were still open, so silver was not yet scarce. The coin bureaus were still casting coins, so copper coins were not yet in short supply. The reason for this is that most of the silver is hidden in private homes, or it flows overseas to be cast into foreign coins. Therefore, even though the Shanghai markets are the most important in the world, they would probably not be able to gather 1 million taels of silver or 1 million strings of cash in a single day.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>How Can Agricultural China Achieve Victory?</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiaomei</p>
<p>Misunderstanding of Economic Factors</p>
<p>In the context of highly technological modern warfare, it seems that industrialized nations, capable of producing new weapons, indeed hold an advantage over agricultural nations that rely on imported armaments. Consequently, a faction of defeatists has harbored doubts from the outset about China's "belief in certain victory in the War of Resistance and certain success in national reconstruction."</p>
<p>If their doubts genuinely stem from "concern for the nation," then their only responsibility lies in diligently assisting the government in devising methods to overcome the difficulties they perceive in their minds. However, if, out of fear of defeat, they engage in collusion with the enemy and acts of treason, then what is the real motive behind their so-called doubts? This becomes quite clear.</p>
<p>Regardless of their motives, analyzing the situation from both theoretical and factual perspectives reveals that the past two and a half years of the War of Resistance have sufficed to correct this defeatist theory. The fundamental error of this theory lies in its failure to grasp the concrete content of "economic factors." What do the economic factors of war refer to? Some say they refer to the so-called "three Ms" of "manpower, materials, and money." Others say they refer to productivity, especially the productivity of the military-industrial complex. The former can be termed the "resource theory," while the latter can be termed the "industry theory." The mistake lies in adhering to one extreme.</p>
<p>Possessing only abundant resources without corresponding productivity is akin to possessing only advanced industrial equipment without the corresponding manpower and raw material resources: both represent an unsound wartime economy. It is meaningless to speak of abundant resources, high productivity, or even of industrialized or agricultural nations. To assess the economic strength of two warring nations, the crucial aspect is to observe the relationship between the enemy's productivity and resource capabilities. Who has a closer and more coordinated relationship? If one possesses only abundant resources without corresponding productivity, it is like wealth discarded on the ground, rendering the abundance useless. If one possesses only advanced industrial equipment without adequate resources to support it, it is no more than a facade, lacking any real power. This reasoning is self-evident.</p>
<p>Wartime Economic Entities of China and Japan</p>
<p>Precisely for this reason, both China and Japan represent unsound wartime economic entities. To believe that China, being an agricultural nation, is at a disadvantage compared to industrialized Japan is indeed an erroneous observation. However, to believe that China, being vast and rich in resources, holds an advantage over resource-poor Japan is also seemingly true but actually false. The truth is undeniable: both China and Japan represent unsound wartime economic entities. The key to victory or defeat in the Sino-Japanese War lies in the degree of this unsoundness; which side is less unsound than the other?</p>
<p>Basis for Agricultural China's Chances of Victory</p>
<p>Let's first consider China: our nation possesses abundant mineral resources, but lacks corresponding production equipment, rendering this wealth useless, a significant deficiency. However, our national economy, and indeed our entire wartime economy, is still based on agriculture due to current factual limitations. Therefore, the crucial question is the extent to which our agricultural resources and agricultural productivity can complement each other. If there is land but no one to cultivate it, or if there is manpower but no land to cultivate, the problem would naturally be severe.</p>
<p>However, our nation is indeed a vast agricultural nation with abundant resources and a large population. The partial loss of land and population has not affected the overall sustenance of the national economy because their production and labor have not been abandoned. Although there may have been temporary pauses due to the war, they quickly resumed. Although the people and resources in the occupied areas are subjected to wanton devastation and plunder, the disruption of wartime freight transportation has forced some rural areas to naturally revert to their former self-sufficient state. In areas where freight transportation is still accessible, they have gained the possibility of increased income due to high prices. The Chinese farmers' virtue of hard work, endurance, and frugality is renowned throughout the world. They now resist the pressure of high prices for industrial goods with frugality, while enjoying the possibility of increased income through diligence. Moreover, the price disparity between industrial and agricultural products is gradually shrinking. All the feudal forces that previously existed in rural areas, such as the pressure from usury and land rent, have become invisibly loosened. Although some rural areas have experienced violence from Japanese puppets and gangsters, they have strengthened their will to resist the war in addition to enduring adversity. The most valuable aspect during wartime is the ability to sustain the national economy. If the majority of the people cannot maintain their livelihoods during wartime or feel the impact of the war deeply, then no matter how smooth things are militarily, a complete collapse is inevitable. However, the economic lives of farmers, who account for more than 85% of China's population, are not problematic. Therefore, the anxiety experienced by landlords, small citizens, and even salaried classes in Shanghai and other cities should be addressed, but it is evident that it is insufficient to affect the sustenance of our entire wartime national economy. Therefore, while China's wartime economy is unsound in terms of industry, it is perfectly sound in terms of agriculture. Precisely because China's roots lie in agriculture, the agricultural economy has become the foundation of the wartime economy. With the agricultural economic system fully sound, the crucial aspect of China's economic war of resistance is no longer a problem.</p>
<p>The Nominality of Industrial Japan</p>
<p>Of course, this is in comparative terms. If industrial Japan's wartime economy were equally sound, then agricultural China's wartime position would indeed be diminished in comparison. However, in reality, Japan's industrial economic system is fundamentally an unsound system. The main reason is that they only have considerable industrial equipment but lack the corresponding resources to support it. However, the industrial economy is the backbone of their entire national economy and even their wartime economy. The danger inherent in the industrial economy itself poses a threat to Japan's entire national economy and even its wartime economy.</p>
<p>From a theoretical perspective, a shortage of domestic raw materials can be addressed through imports. For example, virtually all the raw materials for British industry are imported from abroad. The reason why they were able to sustain themselves in the previous European war, and can largely be expected to do so in the current European war, lies in two reasons: first, they possess substantial financial resources for imports and also have vast overseas colonies providing raw materials; second, they maintain a powerful navy capable of sustaining their maritime transportation, and their position in international diplomacy is generally superior to that of their enemies. Otherwise, even if they have the capacity to maintain maritime transportation, they cannot function if neutral nations refuse to provide them with materials. However, Japan lacks both of these conditions. They are currently trying to replenish their own blood by relentlessly plundering resources from the occupied areas of China. However, unconditional plunder requires the backing of military force. In today's situation where their military strength is insufficient, large-scale plunder still relies on legal tender. This has resulted in a huge trade surplus with China, limiting the assistance it provides in terms of resource scarcity and foreign exchange scarcity. Therefore, they now have plans to restrict exports to China, which is clear evidence that they cannot rely on plundering Chinese resources to compensate for their own lack of resources. This pathological condition of mismatched resource capacity and productivity is undoubtedly the fatal flaw in Japan's wartime economy.</p>
<p>From a factual perspective, the Japanese government's production expansion plan in recent years can be described as swift and decisive. According to the decisions of the 74th Diet last spring, they plan to increase the production of steel and other products by 20% to three times, increasing the average value of production by 75%. Therefore, in the past year, new capital invested reached 5,308 million yen, nearly double the 3,976 million yen of the previous year. More notably, due to extreme panic within the country, they have relentlessly extended working hours for consecutive years. If the working hours in July of Showa 12 (1937) are taken as 100%, then the average working hour index for peaceful industries in July of last year was 85, and in October it was 96. The working hours in military factories increased from 121 in July to 133 in November. Although working hours have been extended so relentlessly, the production index has decreased in inverse proportion. For example, if the average of Showa 6, 7, and 8 (1931-1933) is estimated at 100%, then the overall index decreased from 181.8 in July to 155.6 in September. According to the Japanese government's own explanation, this was due to a sharp decline in the production of electricity and gas due to the coal shortage. In reality, the fundamental problem is still the shortage of raw materials and manpower. The Japanese government overestimated its abilities, only knowing the importance of increasing productivity, but not knowing that without the coordination of resources, the expansion of production equipment is just building castles in the sand, only making the raw material shortage in the industrial sector more obvious. The soaring prices in China are not surprising because the mechanism for price control has not yet been completed. However, in Japan, which has long implemented price control, the increase in prices has continued to keep pace with the times, which further highlights the severity of the resource panic within the country.</p>
<h3>A Word to Small Speculators</h3>
<p>— Cao Zhenzhao</p>
<p>Price fluctuations depend on supply and demand. Scarce supply leads to high prices, while weak demand leads to low prices; this is a natural trend. If supply and demand are balanced and prices rise unreasonably, this is abnormal. The root cause lies in environmental pressures 30% of the time, and in powerful manipulation 70% of the time. Taking Shanghai as an example, the post-war population has suddenly doubled compared to the original. All consumption, such as daily necessities like rice and coal, has exceeded three and a half times the pre-war level, according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's workers' living index. Even if Sino-foreign transportation is blocked and freight rates are high, it should not be so disparate. There must be other main reasons, and the rise of speculation is also the biggest reason. Some small assets or salaried classes are preoccupied all day long, either fearing asset losses or finding that their income is insufficient to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, they rush to buy foreign exchange and hoard goods, thinking that this is the only way to preserve assets and increase income. However, they do not know that this kind of class is originally isolated from market conditions and completely ignorant of recent trends. Relying only on hearsay, on the one hand, they envy others' huge profits, and on the other hand, they want to seek asset security, sometimes buying stocks and foreign exchange, and sometimes hoarding goods and warehouse receipts, all following others' lead. If the foreign exchange shrinks occasionally, they feel anxious and rush to buy in; if the foreign exchange loosens occasionally, they fear losses and rush to sell. This kind of buying and selling, even if they are fortunate enough to profit, they must pay considerable commissions; if they are unfortunate enough to lose, it is really an unexpected disaster, and they cannot reach it. Moreover, this kind of speculative business has long been monopolized and manipulated by specialized operators. It is extremely unwise to pick up leftovers and be used by others. Therefore, to put it bluntly, even if speculation is feasible, they must ask themselves whether they are clear about the market situation? Whether the original assets are sufficient? Whether they will be affected if they fail? If none of these three conditions are met, it is better to deposit in the bank and earn interest. However, based on the general intention of people, there are the following three concerns about depositing in the bank:</p>
<p>(1) Bank interest rates are low, and the gains are small. Bank interest rates are only 3-4% for current deposits and only 7-8% for fixed deposits. Since interest rates are so low, why not try to make profits themselves instead of depositing in the bank? This statement is not entirely true. Although bank interest rates are low, they are more stable than risky speculative businesses. Why should banks passively restrict speculation by appropriately increasing lending rates? It is impossible to analyze and not give to depositors, and they are unwilling to actively encourage savings.</p>
<p>I think there are two ways to increase interest rates: (A) The government guarantees interest, and the government bears part of the increased interest to show preferential treatment. This deposit can be jointly used by the government and the bank to transfer floating funds to the mainland and concentrate production. (B) Promote profit sharing. In addition to the prescribed interest, the bank uses it on behalf of depositors and distributes the remaining profits to depositors. In this way, depositors have no risk of speculation, but have fixed benefits. It is really a win-win situation.</p>
<p>(2) The bank itself also engages in speculative business. Some people think that the bank itself also undertakes this kind of speculative business, such as hoarding goods and buying foreign exchange. It is better for them to do it themselves than for the bank to do it. Fortunately, the bank will profit, and the interest rate will not be increased. If they are unlucky enough to lose, the foundation will be shaken, and the impact will inevitably affect depositors. Therefore, depositing is harmful and not beneficial. This statement seems to have a reasonable reason at first glance; however, after careful examination of the content, it is not entirely true. Not to mention that banks are properly supervised by the government and cannot engage in speculation indiscriminately; even if they occasionally buy and sell foreign exchange, they have their own uses, which are by no means comparable to those of ordinary speculators! And they can choose a bank with stable operations and deposit in it. If the bank handles profit-sharing deposits, its funds are no different from being managed by the bank, so the reliability is even greater than that of individuals.</p>
<p>(3) Restrictions on withdrawals. Some people think that since the government had restrictions on withdrawals on August 13 and the "Ma Telegram" later, they are afraid that if they deposit in the bank, they will become stagnant once they are restricted. Not to mention that the government will never do this again in the future, even if they do, they are only depositing their surplus funds in the bank to earn interest. They only need to use the interest income to maintain their daily expenses, so why bother about this point.</p>
<p>People's selfishness is inherent in human nature and does not need to be concealed. Moreover, for the sake of preserving personal assets, hoarding goods and competing to buy foreign exchange, etc., may have their own unavoidable difficulties. However, can holding foreign exchange, stocks, goods, tungsten ore, etc., really ensure their personal assets? This is questionable, and I will briefly describe the reasons:</p>
<p>(1) Foreign exchange: In today's turbulent European situation, who can guarantee the value of various foreign exchanges and the extent to which it can be maintained? Who did not cherish and value the pound in the past? What about today? The US dollar, which is valued by all parties today, was the currency that everyone trusted the least in 1933. Moreover, who can be sure that the United States can maintain its neutral position? If they think that the position of foreign exchange is always more stable than that of legal tender, this is a completely unreasonable view. Indeed, the decline in exchange rates and the rise in prices are no different from the devaluation of legal tender. However, world prices are rising uniformly; the value of any foreign currency is also depreciating uniformly. It should be known that today's soaring prices are the inevitable impact of the war. Therefore, hoarding legal tender is as dangerous as hoarding foreign exchange; moreover, China's war of resistance has dragged on to this day, and the Japanese economy is on the verge of collapse. Today, they are eagerly seeking peace, and they do not hesitate to set up puppets themselves to make peace, rather than waiting for China to admit defeat. The state of their embarrassment can be imagined. This is especially revealing that the future of legal tender is bright. Moreover, the current foreign exchange has been reduced to the lowest level. According to the international balance of payments, there is absolutely no reason for it. The current international payment exceeds more than three times the previous one. It can be imagined from this that the current unreasonable decline in the exchange rate is inevitable in the future.</p>
<p>(2) Stocks: Stock prices have risen to the highest peak, or have exceeded several times the face value, or even exceeded ten times. However, if you try to see whether the dividends that should be obtained are also several or more than ten times, you will be clear. According to the general intention of buying stocks, they think that these stocks are not low in dividends and are relatively stable. However, the property rights are all controlled by foreign merchants, and the Chinese people cannot intervene. If it is profitable, why would they sell it? Moreover, their prices are mostly calculated in legal tender, which is contradictory.</p>
<p>(3) Tungsten ore: Tungsten ore will definitely be purchased by the government in the future. It cannot be privately exported, nor can it be privately sold for profit. As for the purchase price, it will certainly not be consistent with the recent black market price. If they buy it at a high price today and sell it at a low price at that time, they will inevitably suffer considerable losses.</p>
<p>(4) Goods: If the hoarding of goods is excessive, once foreign exchange is slightly loosened and foreign loans are imported one after another, or if foreigners dump them, the prices will plummet, even at present. Moreover, even if the market price rises, it is a market without a market. If they are not in the industry, they cannot sell at the market price. Sitting and consuming warehouse rent and interest, the result may be more harm than good.</p>
<p>I think that at this time, if they can ship domestic native products to the mainland for export and exchange for foreign exchange, it is really the best way. On the one hand, the government can develop foreign trade, and on the other hand, individuals can also obtain profits. Moreover, there are many maritime people from all over the world, and there must be many products from their hometowns. There may not be few people who are familiar with this way. Instead of competing to accumulate, why not find another source?</p>
<p>In short, in this extraordinary period, hoarding goods and competing to buy foreign exchange are not the way to preserve assets and increase income. It is better to accumulate legal tender and accumulate thrift. Hoarding legal tender has the indirect preparation of full production and the direct preparation of existing funds and guarantees. Depositing in the bank also has considerable interest to be taken. What is the most stable method, why bother to enter the trap, be used by others, and take useless actions with limited energy and material assets? Banks should also have corresponding measures at this time to curb speculative actions, such as refusing to make speculative loans, etc.</p>
<p>National Tung Oil Purchased for Export</p>
<p>Tung oil is now one of the state-run export commodities. In the first ten months of last year, the total amount of tung oil purchased and exported by the Trade Commission reached 32,000 metric tons, which is equivalent to 720,000 dan in the city system. As for the region of its acquisition, it is as shown in the following table. (Note) According to the "Industrial and Commercial News" monthly magazine in Chongqing. Unit: metric tons.</p>
<h3>Price Index of Chongqing City</h3>
<p>According to the price index compiled by the Southwest Economic Construction Research Institute: The prices in the wartime capital have indeed increased sharply, but compared with Shanghai, it seems that they are still not as good as each other.</p>
<p>Year 26 Year 27 Year 28 End of Year 28</p>
<p>(Note) The above three paragraphs are the average for June of each year; the last paragraph is November of Year 28.</p>
<p>It can be seen from this that food prices have increased the slowest; because they are local products, they should not be compared with those that have foreign exchange relations. Nowadays, Shanghai rice merchants openly say that since foreign rice has risen, domestic rice should also follow the rise. Their intentions can be known!</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>North-South Cargo: Black Dates Sell Well</h3>
<p>Recently, black dates have been cheap in the market and vendors are very active. A total of more than 2,000 packages have been opened. The better quality cargo sells for 31-32 yuan, the second grade for 30 yuan, and second-grade dates for 27-28 yuan to 29 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Market Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market stabilized due to the closure of the border and the value of the week, so the trend was stable and transactions were clear. The association made a list of prices: the current price of second-grade coarse sugar white spot goods at this store was 62.24 yuan, and new goods at the foreign store were 62 yuan. Taikoo Chebai was called lower by 12 cents. HX Ma's new goods at the Xizhan store were selling for 67.6 yuan, and HX Ma at the Xizhan store was selling for 63.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Cooked Coal Raised in Dark Market</h3>
<p>The cooked coal market continues to rise. In fact, all parties on this street are collecting it very closely, and because the supply is insufficient for distribution, the black market is exceptionally strong. The same industry line is broken, and it has been called 180 yuan to be delivered, and they still want to add more labor. Therefore, the retail price of each door shop has been raised across the board, 25 yuan per unit, and 10 yuan is sold per 100 city pounds.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Yellow Steel Wire: Factory Demand is Still Lively</h3>
<p>Yellow steel wire, which has been silent for a long time, showed a slight turnaround yesterday. The spring factory, thermos bottle factory, and iron bed, etc. on this street successively moved to do business and bought more than 200 loads. Therefore, the market is still called lively, and people's hearts have also been revived. The standard sales disk has also been raised by about 1 yuan. The current market price of flowers is 35 yuan per load, the middle-grade goods are called 40 yuan per load, and the fine color is sold for about 45 yuan per load.</p>

<p>Sexual Health</p>
<h3>The Changing Affection of Women</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Impact on Husband's Strength and Vigor</p>
<p>If the combination of two sexes cannot harmonize the personalities of both sides, the feelings are often not good. However, the preservation of a woman's love is always shifted by her own desires, so a woman's love is most likely to change. The one she gives her great love to today, once the feeling changes, it is not difficult to regard them as hateful people. The background of love is purely the satisfaction of carnal desires. If a man cannot satisfy a woman's desires, he is in danger of being abandoned by her. People often say that a woman's desires are entirely dominated by vanity, but they do not know that in addition to material vanity, there is also the enjoyment of carnal desire. German physiologist Mr. Weismann said: "The life of a woman is a sexual life, and the thoughts and feelings of a woman are entirely motivated by sexual desire." This is indeed the truth. Looking at a woman who is loved, no matter how happy she is in life, if her husband cannot satisfy her desires, she often does not abide by women's morals and looks for another partner outside. This is a major motivation for women to commit adultery, which is also what those who study women's psychology must know.</p>
<p>Therefore, as a husband, one should always pay attention to the health of his reproductive function. Those who have had spermatorrhea, seminal emission, or impotence should seek medical attention as soon as possible. It should be known that this kind of disease is mostly caused by early masturbation and indulgence. If it is not treated and made worse, the organization of love between the two sides will taste like wax, and the feelings will be like ice and charcoal. Love cannot last forever, not to mention that the disease will extend to the whole body, such as pale complexion, stunted development, back pain, forgetfulness and insomnia, loss of erectile power, and even complete impotence. The various distressing diseases cannot be described in detail, so early treatment is a necessary step. Now that medicine has advanced, German physiologist Dr. Mellen has learned from 30 years of research that this disease is completely due to the rupture of the gonads that dominate sexual desire, and invented the "Bodytone," a genuine male-strengthening animal gonadal preparation, with phosphorus to nourish the brain, iron to nourish the blood, and calcium to nourish the bones. After taking it, the spirit is rejuvenated, and impotence dissipates in an instant. The medicine is effective and nourishes the kidneys 24 hours after taking it. Therefore, the efficacy is the crown of all endocrine preparations. Her female "Bodytone" is an ovarian endocrine preparation that regulates menstruation and seed production and is a good gynecological medicine.</p>
<h3>Youth's Wet Dreams Without Dreams</h3>
<p>— Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany</p>
<p>Treatment of Nocturnal Emission During the Day</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea should be divided into dream and dreamless. Dream emission is less harmful than dreamless emission, but spermatorrhea is more harmful than dreamless emission. The method of treatment should also respond to its causes. If it is caused by excessive masturbation, then it is appropriate to first abstain from masturbation. If it comes from荒淫, then it is especially appropriate to be temperate in desire and nourish life. Pay attention to the various sperm-consolidating drugs on the market, all of which advocate consolidating the sperm gate, and must not be taken indiscriminately. The ingredients contained in this type of drug all contain toxic substances that anesthetize the ejaculation center and paralyze the sperm gate. Its ability to achieve temporary success relies on this anesthetic ingredient. Its harm is as ridiculous as using morphine to quit opium addiction, and the abuses are endless. It must be known that drinking鸩to quench thirst is not done by the wise, so the best treatment should be to take medicine and health care in parallel. All stimulating cigarettes, alcohol and other products should be quit, and the body should not be overworked. If you can rub the area with cold water for ten minutes before going to bed, it will be very effective if you can continue to do it for a long time. It is also appropriate to take "Nairs Spermatorrhea Tablets", only three tablets before going to bed, which can completely stop spermatorrhea. This product has absolutely no side effects, does not damage digestive function, and has no disadvantages if taken for a long time. This is the祭酒in spermatorrhea medicine, and has been popular for more than 20 years. No matter how fierce spermatorrhea is, it has the effect of taking effect that night. If the body is too weak, then combine it with the German endocrine preparation "Bodytone" to make up for the loss. The effect of taking the two medicines together is like a god.</p>
<h3>New Estimates of Chemical Therapy for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States</p>
<p>Chemotherapy is the latest term for the most recently invented treatment for淋. However, there are pros and cons, and there are no completely perfect results without disadvantages. Therefore, many doctors and patients hesitate and doubt because of its large reaction, and dare not apply it. This certainly has considerable reason. However, with the progress of science, this defect can be improved. The one who has achieved the most in researching gonorrhea treatment is the German gonorrhea master Dr. Peter. Dr. Peter's thinking is progressive. All kinds of effective treatments for淋have been tested, and finally, for chemical therapy, he felt that it does have special effects on the treatment of淋, but it is necessary to improve its bad ingredients and have no reaction. Therefore, Dr. Peter went one step further and invented a specially made chemical therapy drug "New Clinon". This agent has a very strong bactericidal power. After taking it, there is no adverse reaction in the part of the drug that passes through the stomach and intestines. The reason is that this agent is purely refined and does not contain toxic substances, so there is no adverse reaction. However, its power to kill淋bacteria is unusually strong, reaching the lesion directly without harming its healthy tissue, and it is not like general chemical therapy, which has severe reactions, causing the complexion to turn blue. Only "New Clinon" has absolutely no such reaction, because its bactericidal power is thorough, so regardless of the symptoms of acute淋at the beginning or various symptoms of gonorrhea when it turns into chronic淋. Taking "New Clinon" has the certainty of rapid cure without leaving bad sequelae. In my many years of clinical experience, only after the two drugs "New Clinon" were introduced can it be called the highest peak of chemical therapy. And this kind of special medicine has won the unanimous encouragement and appreciation of doctors all over the world. ("New Clinon" Zhengwei and Taihe are both sold)</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>— Doctor Yao Ju</p>
<p>Outpatient Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>The Relationship between Seasonality and Bacteria: There is a great relationship between seasonality and the survival of bacteria. Therefore, many seasonal diseases are quite rampant in their five seasons, and are rarely seen in a certain season. This is probably because of the twelve points of relationship with the effectiveness of climate activities. Now let's take the activities of淋bacteria as an example. The transmission of gonorrhea is certainly not limited to climate and seasonality, but it cannot be said that the activities of淋bacteria have nothing to do with climate. Now that spring returns to the earth and everything is thriving, we humans are also more active in action than in the cold season because of the spring sunshine. Therefore, the long-dormant淋bacteria will inevitably take the opportunity to move out and wreak havoc, so there are many chronic淋that have not healed, which often have to break out again in the spring. The reason is here. There is also another reason. It is also an element for the肆of gonorrhea, that is, five people are more in need of love in the spring than in other seasons. Therefore, it is also the main cause of the transmission of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Easily Cured Opportunity: However, the story should be turned around. This season when淋bacteria are most active is also the season when gonorrhea is most easily cured. Because at this time,淋bacteria that have been久longing to move have a tendency to attack the nest. Therefore, taking advantage of its complete activity to make a thorough eradication is really a matter of killing several birds with one stone. According to my experience, the gonorrhea holy medicine "New Clinon" (available at Wing On Company) is the best. Because the bactericidal effect of "New Clinon" is meticulous, it is even more useful to use German electrostatic therapy and X-ray electrotherapy alternately. As a result, the latent淋bacteria are quickly extinguished, so the New Year season is indeed the best opportunity to eradicate gonorrhea, so please do not miss this opportunity.</p>
<p>Consultation hours: 10 am to 6 pm. Starting today, 20 numbers will be sent for consultation every day, and each number will only cost 50 cents.</p>
<h3>Hemoptysis Should Be Cured Quickly</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang, Physician</p>
<p>Regarding hemoptysis due to tuberculosis, the blood vessels in the diseased part are fragile, and hemoptysis symptoms are caused by the sudden rupture of the pulse tubes due to exercise and coughing. Tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and the changes of all diseases go through a very slow process. However, hemoptysis is a sudden event, so effective treatment must be carried out, and absolute negligence is not allowed. However, in theory and experience, hemoptysis is not absolutely a critical illness. However, it cannot be regarded as a minor symptom. According to my many years of experience, in terms of internal medicine, "Lung Tonic" is the most effective. Not only can hemoptysis be cured, but the source of hemoptysis can also be cured. I said that the merger of lung disease and hemoptysis is not terrible, and the reason is here. Moreover, "Lung Tonic" has the miraculous effect of killing lung tuberculosis bacteria, so it is the most effective internal medicine for lung disease and hemoptysis.</p>
<h3>Japan's Increased Production Policy Expected to Fail</h3>
<p>The shortage of raw materials and manpower has shattered the Japanese government's increased production policy. According to a survey by the Japanese Toyo Keizai Shinpo Sha, Japan's industrial and mining production index reached its peak in August last year and then began to collapse. The table is as follows: (Showa 6 (converted to percentage in the eighth year)</p>

<h3>Food Belief and Longevity</h3>
<p>— Sun Xian Dao Cheng</p>
<p>At the refugee relief art performance conference hosted by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Township Group Fundraising Committee yesterday at the Broadway Concert Hall, Dr. Ding Fubao publicly elaborated on the method of longevity. The main skills related to the two major elements of food and accommodation are recorded in this publication. (What Mr. Ding said below) The most important condition for longevity is to have a suitable diet. As the saying goes, disease enters through the mouth. It can be said that food has a great relationship with human life. It is better to follow the example of German leader Hitler's abstinence from meat, smoking and drinking. The above items contain very tiny toxic substances, and long-term consumption is easy to be poisoned. It is best to eat brown rice, vegetables, soybeans and other items every day because these items contain rich nutrients. Salt is especially suitable to be reduced, and should not be eaten too much. Fruits are beneficial to the human body, and it is okay to eat more. This can avoid hardening of blood vessels, high blood pressure, nephritis, liver disease, etc. Also, all foods should be chewed slowly and swallowed slowly, and it is especially important to eat less. At most, eat to 70% or 80% of your appetite, and do not eat too full. Ms. Lu Bicheng, a senior member of the Chinese education community, said that the world may worry that vegetarianism is unhygienic, but it is actually a misunderstanding. Her English friend told her that vitamins are divided into five categories A, B, C, D, and F in fresh fruits and vegetables, which are the most essential for health preservation and can cure various diseases. They are found in almost all fruits and vegetables. The greatness of its nourishing power cannot be compared with the dead corpses of animals. Eating meat is harmful and can cause various diseases. Smoking and drinking not only consume money, but are also not suitable for health. In the past, the rice and wheat in our country were pounded with stone mortars and ground with stone mills. Although they were rough, they were hygienic. Since the invention of rice milling machines, valuable nutrients have been completely removed. The reason why people in cities are not as healthy as people in rural areas is also related to the fineness of the rice they eat. The above is about food. As for housing, in addition to sufficient sunshine and fresh air, the best sleeping time every night is 9 pm, and you should get up at dawn. When sleeping, you should lie on your right side in the first half of the night, and lie on your left side in the second half of the night, because the lower mouth of the stomach must be inclined to the right side in the first half of the night, so that the food staying in the stomach can easily enter the duodenum and be transported to the small intestine, so it is advisable to lie on the right side. Other things such as exercise can get the mean, the spirit can be quiet, not greedy, not looking for troubles, and things that cannot be told to others should not be done. In short, the Confucian school is cautious and alone, then you will have longevity. Now the general sons on the isolated island are all happy at night and sleep during the day, which is equivalent to killing their lives. It's a pity!</p>
<h3>Talking About Shoes</h3>
<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>In recent years, people in cities, regardless of men or women, like to wear leather shoes. Except for women wearing high heels that are not worth learning from, a person who wears leather shoes seems to be able to invigorate their spirits when walking and working. At the same time, they seem to be more imposing!</p>
<p>However, recently Shanghai has seen soaring prices in everything. To buy a pair of middle-to-upper-class leather shoes, I am afraid that it will cost no less than twenty or thirty yuan. Even if it is a little lower, it will cost about ten yuan. Therefore, all those who wear leather shoes should pay special attention to saving their leather shoes in the future. For example, when at home or in the office, you may as well buy a pair of cloth shoes to wear. When going out, change into leather shoes. This adjustment can also save some money!</p>
<p>I heard that people in the interior are wearing cloth shoes because of the high prices. I think Shanghai people can also follow suit. A pair of women's shoes with wool woven uppers and red leather soles on the market now costs five or six yuan. Young people walk heavily, and often a pair of shoes can only be worn for one or two months before they break. This is really too uneconomical! Why not change to cloth shoes? They are both simple and comfortable.</p>
<h3>You Can't Live Without Bamboo</h3>
<p>— Ai Li</p>
<p>The ancients said it well: "You would rather eat without meat than live without bamboo." It can be seen that the ancients loved bamboo deeply. Wherever they lived, they had to plant a few bamboos to feel elegant. Bamboo is one of the most valuable things among plants. It can be eaten and grown. Therefore, rural families often have a bamboo garden, which is a great help in terms of production. I have always loved bamboo. In my old home in my hometown, I also planted dozens of bamboos. I like to watch the new green of the bamboo leaves, and I like to listen to the sound of rain on the bamboo tips. And when the spring bamboo shoots are budding, I have to borrow them as appetizers, so my feelings for bamboo are too good. I really can't live without this gentleman for a day. However, since my hometown fell into enemy hands, I have never gone back and have been separated from the bamboo garden for a long time. I can't even think about eating bamboo shoots. In recent years, I have been cramped on the sea, living on the third floor of someone else's house. Opening the window, I can only see the cliffs or windows of my neighbors on the left, right, front, and back. I can't even see a tree, let alone a bamboo garden. The old saying of the ancients "You can't live without bamboo" has long been overturned. However, my love for bamboo is too deep. Although there is no bamboo garden where I live, I still have to buy one or two potted small bamboos to serve as a clear offering on my desk, and I also have to hang a few ancient bamboo paintings on the wall for appreciation. Even the appetizers for these few days must be bamboo shoots. Yesterday, after drinking, I had nothing to do and went to the Da Xin Company to visit the calligraphy and painting exhibition of Old Man Fen. Old Man Fen's calligraphy has long been famous. Whether it is official script, cursive script, seal script, or clock鼎stone drum script, he writes well. But I have never seen his paintings before. I heard that he has dozens of bamboo paintings this time, so I went to see them specially. After seeing them, I couldn't help but admire him. It turned out that his bamboos, whether sparse or dense, were all refined and detached. He was simply looking up to Wen Yuke and Xia Zhongzhao's halls. Taoist Banqiao is really not worth mentioning. I have heard old gentlemen say that whoever writes well will definitely paint bamboo well. Old Man Fen's calligraphy is good, so it is no wonder that he can paint many good bamboo heads as soon as he starts. The poems are mostly written by Old Man Fen himself. I love one of them the most: (Looking west at Kuizhou, I am saddened, Don't feel ashamed that you have no power to repay涓, A branch is sent to express the meaning in front of the wind, It is originally known that arrows are needed for killings.) After chanting again and again, I feel that Lu Fangweng is a little far away from the people. I think in the shortest possible time, I will ask Old Man Fen to wave his如橡pen and paint a stone and a few techniques of bamboo for me, and then inscribe this poem and match it with a square mirror frame so that it can be hung in my碧玟玕阁. I know that when the wind comes in the middle of the night, there will be a rustling sound coming from the back of the paper.</p>
<h3>Two New Weapons for Land Transportation</h3>
<p>— Liu Yun</p>
<p>In recent years, the development of the automobile industry in Europe and the United States has really been progressing by leaps and bounds. I heard that a young inventor in the United States has recently invented a "night-light car". That is, the car is coated with a layer of phosphorescent paint, so when it comes to night, the car emits a dazzling light, which can be seen by people even half a mile away!</p>
<p>A Soviet engineer has recently invented that the steam from locomotives can still be returned to the water pot to save the trouble of trains stopping to add water. The method is actually very simple, that is, the steam sprayed out by the locomotive is led to another container, cooled and condensed into water, and then re-injected into the water pot. With such a device, the train can continue to travel for more than four or five hundred miles.</p>
<h3>The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of a Perfect Couple</h3>
<p>— Traveler's View</p>
<p>In the past, during the era of monarchs, people had only one path to success. Talented individuals from across the country gathered in the imperial court, leading to a "hydrocephalic" nation with an overdeveloped brain and underdeveloped limbs. Therefore, the "perfect life" was merely defined by the six characters "wealth, honor, and longevity." Such outdated notions are, of course, extremely unsuitable for a later age of scientific progress and democratic evolution. Fellow countrymen who aspire to a happy life should first understand what constitutes a perfect and happy man and woman in other countries. I have exhausted my life's efforts, yet I have not only failed to benefit my countrymen, but also do not know how to seek happiness for myself. Recently, American newspapers have held a grand competition to find the perfect couple. If our country could emulate this, it would deeply correct mistaken societal views, open up new avenues for national progress, and allow us to consider economic conditions and enjoy regulated and planned leisure activities, thereby creating countless perfect and happy families throughout China.</p>
<p>The main conditions for the American newspapers' so-called "perfect couple" are based on four questions, soliciting responses widely:</p>
<p>(1) The husband must be ambitious and have excellent qualities, while the wife must be harmonious, beautiful, and have no occupation. (Note: This emphasizes "completeness," not that women should not have occupations.)</p>
<p>(2) The husband's income should be at least US$1,500 per year. (Note: The cost of living in the United States is remarkably high; an annual income of US$1,500 is nearly the lowest salary for a married man, equivalent to a monthly salary of eighty yuan for a National Government employee when the exchange rate had not yet fallen.)</p>
<p>(3) The wife must be skilled at cooking.</p>
<p>(4) They must have three children, ideally two boys and one girl.</p>
<p>Subsequently, tens of thousands of written responses were received from readers. After detailed examination by the editorial staff, the "standard perfect couple" selected as the first-place winner was the McDonnell family from Gainesville, Florida, who had been married for ten years and had a monthly income of US$200. The husband is 35 years old, the wife is 31 years old, and they currently have two sons. The elder son is named Washington, and the younger son is named Theodore. In their ten years of marriage, they have only quarreled once. It is said that their disagreement stemmed from differing opinions on the naming of their elder son. Ultimately, they followed the husband's suggestion and named their eldest son after the first President of the United States. When their younger son was born, they followed the wife's suggestion and named him after the twenty-fifth President, Theodore Roosevelt. Western customs generally avoid imitating others and lagging behind. However, when naming children, they not only fail to have unique "personalities," but also engage in relentless and uncompromising disputes, which is difficult for people from the Far East to understand. The McDonnell family's clothing, food, housing, and transportation are detailed below:</p>
<p>Clothing: The wife spends very little on clothing each year, purchasing only two new outfits and two new hats, all within a specific period during clothing market sales. In European and American families, this is considered extremely frugal, as men's clothing does not undergo frequent style changes and can be carefully maintained for many years without wearing out.</p>
<p>Food: The couple eats at home year-round. However, each week, the wife spends half an afternoon at a tea party with female friends, or hosts a tea party for them at home. The husband spends time in the club once a week. (Europeans also have casual chats with friends, also once a week.) In addition, the husband drinks a glass of whiskey (often mixed with soda water and drunk late at night) every day, and smokes two pouches of tobacco and ten paper-rolled cigarettes. (Note: "Whiskey" is from the Irish language, "Beatha" means life, and "Uisge" means water.)</p>
<p>Housing: They live in a small, elegant house with a garden, but do not hire a maid.</p>
<p>Transportation: They own a car for outings, but do not employ a driver. They go to the cinema once a week, the theater or concert hall once a month, and an exhibition once every three months, or instead of visiting an exhibition, they take a leisurely tour of the museum. Every Sunday, they go out to the gardens and fields for leisure, always with the entire family.</p>
<h3>Weekly Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>In Shanghai, during this difficult time of economic hardship, it goes without saying that chicken, duck, fish, and meat are unaffordable. Even ordinary vegetables, which poor people rely on to eat with rice, have all risen in price. It is truly forcing people to become immortal beings who do not consume earthly food. Speaking of relatively inexpensive vegetables, only yellow bean sprouts and tea bean sprouts are available, each costing about one and a half jiao per catty. After cooking, they can fill two bowls, enough for two meals, day and night. Yellow bean sprouts have a natural freshness, are rich in vitamins, and are very chewy, making them a truly affordable food. When making meat dishes, it is best to braise them with beef slices. First, stir-fry the yellow bean sprouts briefly, then add the beef slices and braise them together. You can add a lot of broth, which is very delicious with rice. If you don't eat beef, you can substitute pork slices, which are also delicious. Tea bean sprouts are also known as silver sprouts. If stir-fried with roasted duck shreds, they can be served at banquets. Usually, they are stir-fried with pork shreds, and should not be overcooked to maintain their crispness. In addition, you can add some chive sprouts or pickled mustard tuber shreds as you like, which also have a unique flavor.</p>

<h3>A Major Problem on the Isolated Island</h3>
<p>— Yang Zi</p>
<p>Blacklisted friends, you must: Think while lying down, speak while sitting, and act while standing!</p>
<p>During the days of strict prohibition, at a time of bright spring sunshine, those sinking in the sea of suffering should not delay in quitting their addictions.</p>
<p>"What time is it now?" This is the first question I want to ask my blacklisted compatriots on this isolated island.</p>
<p>The government's consistently proactive anti-opium policy has reached its deadline for cessation this month on the 31st. According to reports, the government authorities are determined to thoroughly enforce it. Starting from April 1st, anyone who smokes opium again will be sentenced to death. Even elderly and sick smokers will be dealt with strictly without exception. It is evident that opium's life has only a few days of lingering breath left. Although smokers on this isolated island, where the government's reach is limited, can still eke out a living for some time, the danger is always great. Just imagine, from next month onwards, smokers will be carrying a terrible death sentence on their backs, wouldn't that be very unsettling? Therefore, during this period, smokers must quit. Now, during this period of gentle breezes and warm sunshine, it is the perfect opportunity to quit smoking. At the same time, land prices are so expensive, rice is so expensive, and all commodity prices are so expensive. Therefore, to resist the torrents of this great era, to establish a foundation for struggle, and to open up a bright future, smokers should not fail to quit during this period. Because smokers cannot but quit during this period, and should not fail to quit, a craze for smoking cessation drugs has formed under a speculative mentality. Those who are determined to quit smoking should be particularly cautious amidst this craze. If money is wasted and the goal of cessation is not achieved, but instead the severity of the drug addiction is increased, harming the entire physical constitution, that is even more unwise than smoking. Therefore, the most important issue in quitting smoking is choosing a good doctor and absolutely avoiding making one's body an experimental product for speculative medicines.</p>
<p>Dr. Lai Gōngliàng of the White Cross Road Hospital has accumulated over ten years of experience in smoking cessation. The number of people who have quit is countless. All the thank-you letters piled high are ironclad proof of his achievements. (Regarding the countless thank-you letters, they could be printed as a special edition, but because Dr. Lai does not like to make exaggerated publicity, he would rather save the advertising fees and reduce the burden on those quitting smoking. If you want to know the truth, you can go to the hospital to browse them.) As for the safety and efficacy of Dr. Lai's smoking cessation methods, the newspapers have consistently published truthful reports in the past. I believe that those who are determined to quit smoking also understand that Dr. Lai's smoking cessation is by no means comparable to that of quacks. During the cessation process, work continues as usual, the spirit is even better than when smoking, the addiction is broken unconsciously, and there is never a relapse after quitting. These are the four most prominent characteristics of Dr. Lai's smoking cessation: (1) sound sleep, (2) smooth bowel movements, (3) refreshed spirit, and (4) increased appetite. Anyone who has been treated by Dr. Lai is willing to guarantee it with their character, because Dr. Lai takes full responsibility for helping people quit smoking and guarantees safe cessation. For example, I am one of those who had their smoking habit broken by Dr. Lai. Because smokers have the greatest tendency to be lazy, I am specifically reminding smokers that they really cannot be lazy anymore during this period. The address of the Public Health Hospital is at 208 White Cross Road in the British Concession. The telephone number is 9521. If you have any questions about smoking cessation, please inquire at the Public Health Hospital in person. There are also trial service measures to demonstrate the value.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>In Memory of Mr. Cai Yuanpei</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yimo</p>
<p>Mr. Cai and I were born in the same year and month, but he was eleven days older than me. Last year, on the seventeenth day of the old lunar calendar, his disciple Mr. Yu Tianmin came to visit and said, "Today is Mr. Cai's birthday. He is not entertaining outside guests, but because you are an old friend, he has specially invited you to chat at noon." On that day, Mrs. Cai hosted a feast, and the only guests present were Mr. Cai's nephew Cai Taichong and his wife, a Mr. Qi, and Tianmin, as well as the host and hostess. Last month, I visited him two or three times again for some matters. I never imagined he would leave the world so quickly. At lunch the day before his death, he ate heartily as usual. In the afternoon, he bent over to pick something up and stumbled, then spat out purple blood. The doctor said it was a gastric ulcer. He was carried to the Yanghe Hospital, where his limbs were cold and his breath was barely perceptible. His nephew transfused him with four bowls of blood. Soon his hands and feet twitched, but his speech was already slurred. He passed away at 9:45 the next morning. Mr. Chen Binhe took care of his funeral arrangements and informed me of his illness, also asking me to write a brief account for historical materials. Since I did not bid farewell to Mr. Cai, I will record my friendship and feelings for him. As Ouyang Xiu said, "Regretting for the world above, and mourning for his personal loss below."</p>
<p>Mr. Cai passed the imperial examination in the gengyin year and entered the Hanlin Academy. His examination papers were examined by Wang Haoyin, an elder from my hometown. He found the first paper unusual, not resembling the stereotyped eight-legged essay. But the second and third papers were incredibly erudite, so he recommended all three papers and praised him. I heard this from Wang Haoyin's sons, Jilie and Jitong.</p>
<p>During the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, Mr. Cai was a teacher at Nanyang Public School. When student movements arose, he established Patriotic Schools and was recommended as their leader. At that time, the authorities aimed to suppress student movements. Soon, Mr. Cai and eight other gentlemen, including Wu Zhihui, Zhang Taiyan, and the Monk of Wumu Mountain, were wanted. He went abroad and joined Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Tongmenghui (Revolutionary Alliance).</p>
<p>In the guimao year, I was sent to Zhili as a special candidate recommended by a provincial graduate, and was appointed as a reserve county magistrate in the Beiyang government. Mr. Cai was overseas, and I did not have the opportunity to meet him. During the Xinhai Revolution, when Sun Yat-sen became President, Mr. Cai headed the Ministry of Education. When Sun Yat-sen ceded the presidency to Yuan Shikai, the Tongmenghui cabinet resigned en masse and went into retirement.</p>
<p>When Mr. Cai entered the Ministry of Education, he appointed Fan Jingsun as the Director-General. Members of the Ministry, such as Xia Zengyou and Lu Xun, were all talented individuals, and he did not use party affiliation as a standard. The regulations he drafted were universally accepted as groundbreaking for the Republic of China. In the fourth year of the Republic (1915), I became the Minister of Education because I advised against the imperial system. I followed Mr. Cai's principles. I saw in the files of the National Language Unification Association that representatives from twenty provinces, including Mongolia and Tibet, were gathered in one place to standardize the language. Before it could be implemented, I requested the establishment of a Phonetic Alphabet Training Institute. This was the beginning of the Ministry of Education's National Language Unification Association. Mr. Cai was the president, and Mr. Wu Zhihui and I were his deputies. The promotion of the national language in various provinces, and the textbook revisions to vernacular Chinese after the eighth year of the Republic (1919), were all initiated by Mr. Cai. When Fan Jingsun was the Minister, he deplored the corruption of Peking University and changed it to an independent system, appointing Mr. Cai as its president. Mr. Cai invited Wang Guowei, Gu Hongming, and Liu Shipei to lecture on classical literature, and Hu Shi, Qian Xuantong, and Chen Duxiu to lecture on modern literature, bringing all factions together in one furnace. He was like a river that accepts all small streams, allowing different paths to coexist without conflict, and nurturing all things without harm. How great he was!</p>
<p>During the May Fourth Movement, the government surrounded Peking University students with soldiers. Mr. Cai had Jiang Menglin act as the acting president and left a note on his desk, saying, "The one who killed your horse is a passerby on the road." He then secretly left. Thereafter, when people spoke of academic atmosphere, the old school focused their criticism on Mr. Cai's laissez-faire attitude, while the new school regarded it as the first sign of Chinese students saving the country. Dr. John Dewey of the United States was lecturing in Beijing at the time, and believed that the student movement could represent a new awakening (Dewey's lecture collection). Impartial judgment will be left to future generations.</p>
<p>Between the sixth and seventh years of the Republic (1917-1918), U.S. Minister Reinsch and Mr. Xiong Bingsan were the presidents of the Sino-American Association. Mr. Cai, Mr. Wang Liangchou, and I were all members of the Association, which met twice a month. In the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), Mr. Cai returned to Shanghai from Europe. Mr. Huang Renzhi and I welcomed him together. Mr. Cai said that there must be free assembly organizations in the country, and that is why the National Affairs Conference was held, with Mr. Yu Rizhang recommended as president. Ultimately, it ceased operations due to a lack of funding. The Tang (Shaoyi) and Zhu (Qiqian) North-South peace talks followed, and Sun Yat-sen's northern expedition declaration followed, but ultimately they did not achieve unification.</p>
<p>After the success of the Northern Expedition, Mr. Cai was a member of the Central Supervisory Committee and the Director of the Academia Sinica. During this time, I had the opportunity to travel to Yushan Mountain at the invitation of Chang Yihuai and Pang Diancai, and I shared lodging with Mr. Cai. That's why I sent him a poem last year, saying: "Even more solid after Yushan, we rejoiced together amidst the songs of triumph." In the future, when I revisit Yushan Mountain, I will pour wine to toast Mr. Cai's spirit and sing songs of triumph in his honor.</p>
<p>After the August 23rd Incident (1937), Mr. Cai went to Hong Kong in disguise, using the pseudonym Zhou Ziyu. The following May, when I moved to Hong Kong, I visited him and learned that he had undergone foot surgery at the German Hospital in the former capital. Later, he had another surgery in Hong Kong, making walking difficult. Because of the New Writing Movement, Mr. Cai and President Sun Zhesheng had a declaration of over seven hundred people, and he agreed to be the honorary chairman, and we consulted him frequently. His wife, Mrs. Zhou Yanghao, took meticulous care of his daily life, and they also enjoyed composing poetry together. Two months ago, Mr. Cai told me: "Cataracts have grown in both eyes, and doctors advise surgery, but because of my old age, I haven't had the operation." Another doctor said not to operate, but to wash them with medicinal water. It is inconvenient to read under the lamp now. Recently, I have received several poems from him, and I should have them cast in zinc plates to preserve his last writings.</p>
<p>Mr. Cai treated everyone equally and never showed anger. He approached everything with a research attitude. The Song Dynasty people said: "Seeing Cheng Mingdao is like sitting in a spring breeze"; he had this quality. He loved to learn and think deeply, and he always had a book in his hand. He taught himself Latin when he was old, and after going abroad, he thoroughly learned German, English, Japanese, and French. He opened newspapers every day in Hong Kong, so he was well-informed about the situation even without leaving his house. Whether people knew him or not, they regarded him as a towering figure, but they were unable to learn his profound nature. His spirit will forever remain between heaven and earth, as a model for a democratic nation. Mr. Cai took national love and equality as his guiding principles, and lamented the lack of universal national education, and that the "rickshaw" of Chinese characters could not reach the masses, so he loudly called for the New Writing. During this period of resistance and nation-building, the government surely cherishes the older generation and will complete Mr. Cai's legacy to benefit four hundred and fifty million people. Mr. Cai can now rest in peace.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Reading "Ninety-Nine Price Hikes"</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>After Ba Jin proposed a movement to increase manuscript fees, I read an article titled "Ninety-Nine Price Hikes." The title seems humorous, but the author's pen is not humorous at all, and just like my "Thoughts After Reading," I feel endless pain. The poverty of writers has been a fact since ancient times, and "poverty leading to excellent work" seems to be the most honorable compliment. But now is not the time to "store it away on a famous mountain." If there are still bookworms like those in the imperial examination era, reading behind closed doors and writing late into the night, then their poverty is deserved, because those "articles" that only have form but no content, even if they are "excellent," are worthless. Since the War of Resistance, the work of writers with their pens has not lagged behind. On the front lines, in the rear, and even in the occupied areas, they have not forgotten their responsibilities, promoting the true value of words. Chairman Chiang said that elementary school teachers teaching children in classrooms are no different from soldiers in the trenches on the front lines. The power that the writers gave to the war effort was an indelible value. However, the poverty of writers is now so extreme that even the opportunity of elementary school teachers' appeals for a salary raise is not there for them. The sympathy that society gives them is far below that of elementary school teachers. Ba Jin is still a famous writer (this does not mean that "famous" and "unknown" are used to distinguish writers), so the lives of other unknown writers can be imagined!</p>
<p>At this time, publishing articles, although a small hope for monetary value, is the only way writers can make a living through words. Therefore, my "thoughts" also hopes that general merchants, newspaper and magazine publishers, will have "thoughts" too.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 22: News Travels from Afar; Revered Discussions are Human Beliefs</p>
<p>After the paper plates are made in the paper plate room, they are sent to the casting room next to the casting furnace. The paper plate room has six paper plate making machines, so twelve pages of news can be made at the same time. The casting room also has melting furnaces, equipped to cast lead plates simultaneously. Because the lower part of each melting furnace has a pipe opening, the lead liquid can be injected into the casting mold with a single turn. After it is opened, it becomes a semi-circular full-page lead type, which can be placed on the machine's drum. As they walked out of there, Shao Huihua said: "There is a small paper warehouse here, you can also take a look, fortunately that warehouse is never closed." This is a nearly underground room. Although Shao Huihua said it was just a small warehouse for stacking paper, it can also store six hundred rolls of large paper rolls. Because according to Shao Huihua, there is another large warehouse, but it is outside the building, not inside the building. In addition, several special Chinese paper mills can also deposit there, and ship goods at any time. This paper warehouse is only for several days or a week. From the paper warehouse to the machine room, there are two small electric railway tracks, which are specially used for transporting paper rolls. Transporting paper rolls does not require manpower. Just put the whole piece on a flat car, follow this track, and automatically push it to the rotary press. There are two workers next to it who are in charge of the paper pieces. The paper roll is placed on the tube in a row, and when one tube is used up, another one is attached to it. The connection is so fast. In the paper warehouse, we just looked at it. To see them working actively, it is best to come in the middle of the night. Coming out of the paper warehouse, they came to the typesetting room. This typesetting room is on the second floor. It is also a large room, and the type cases are arranged very densely. Only some people were already working there, probably setting the daily advertisements, as well as secondary publications and other less important manuscripts, etc., which can be done a little more leisurely. As for the important news, it is not yet time. But the electric lights in the typesetting room were already shining brightly, and work was about to begin. They saw that there were also several skylights leading from the typesetting room to the upper floor. Above each type case, there are double-wire electric baskets that are sent directly to the upper floor through the skylight. Qu Wushuang said: "Our editorial department is on the third floor, and the proofreading room is also on the third floor. So the editorial department sends manuscripts to the typesetting room, which are sent here by electric basket, and the typesetting room sends the manuscripts to the proofreading room after typesetting, which are also sent by electric basket. In this way, the labor of manual running is saved. Otherwise, the place is so big, running back and forth would be very time-consuming. Because the editorial department, the typesetting room, and the proofreading room, this one institution has a close relationship. Also, from the typesetting room to the small proofing room, from the small proofing room to the layout room, from the layout room to the large proofing room, you see, these electric baskets are also installed as densely as spider webs."</p>
