<h3 id="c8">美國大選前夕 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>美國大選，將於後天舉行。羅斯福總統是吾聯任，當可在今後數十小時之內，得到一個確切答案，這在舉世皇皇，美國儼成中流砥柱的今日，無疑地，已爲全世界所矚目的大事。</p>
<p>依照美國憲法規定，大選是採複選制的：先由各州選民投第一决票，以選出五百三十一位，亦即相等於參衆兩院議員總數之大選代表，然後再由這些大選代表投第二决票，正式選出下屆正副總統。本月五日所舉行的即是第一决投票，當由各州選民各自投票選舉他們所贊成的大選候選人，如果民主黨的候選人在某一州得到多數票，那麼此一州所富選出之大選代表若干席，即全部歸民主黨所得。例如後天投票結果，羅斯福在紐的州所得的票數，壓倒其他各黨候選人，則紐的州依法應選出的大選代表四十七席，即全部由民主黨人担任，於是羅斯福在大選第二决投票舉行時，便可穩得紐的州的四十七票；因此，後天的投票雖祇是第一决投票，但各黨所得大選代表的席數，屆時既可全部揭曉，何人可以當選，自已不難一望而知。假定民主黨能在後天佔得五百三十一席之過半數，即佔得二百六十六席以上，則羅斯福總統的三屆聯任，不必待第二决投票，即可確定無疑了。</p>
<p>一九三二年羅斯福第一次當選總統時，曾於第一次投票中，在四十二州獲勝，因此共得四百七十二票，共和黨的候選人胡佛僅分得五十九票；一九二六年羅氏當選聯任，曾在四十六州獲勝，共得五百二十三票，而共和黨的候選人藍登，則僅僅得了梅因州的五票與凡爾蒙州的三票，這是羅斯福在前兩次大選中的空前勝利。一般人預料羅斯福在這决競選中，或者不能得到如前兩决的絕大多數，原因小外三點：（一）總統三次聯任，在美國傳統上是從未有過的，不但反對黨引爲攻擊目標，就是民主黨內表示異議的，也不無其人；（二）共和黨本屆所推舉的候選人威爾基，在外交政策和國防政策上，幾和羅斯福主張從同，這種策略顯使民主黨失掉一個號召的利器；（三）共和黨在內政方面，對於現政府所實施之「新政」運動和一般經濟政策，攻擊甚力，頗能取得一般資本家和商人的好感，同時又能藉以吸引民主黨中反對新政的人物，以搖撼該黨的陣容。事實上，共和黨之在各州逐漸恢復其過去地位，都已在一九三八年暨本年最近正在舉行中的兩次國會選舉，獲有明證，其在後天的大選中，行將出以更熱烈的競爭，允屬意料中事。</p>
<p>本來，就地域言，民主黨在美國西南兩部佔優勢，共和黨則在東部新英倫六州較爲得勢、雙方所角逐的當爲中部各州的選票；就階級分野而論，擁護羅斯福的是農民和下層階級，以及自由主義的智識份子，而站在威爾基背後的都是大資本家和一部份反對新政的工商界人士，二人所爭取的當爲中層階級。依照民意測騐院於上月十四日所發表的測騐結果，羅斯福可得四四一票，若根據路透社訪員最近所作的估計則羅氏可在三十四州獲勝，的佔三百六十六票，威爾基可得十四州的擁護，約佔一百六十五票，這些估計數字當然不足憑信，不過，依大勢來推測，在這國際時局日趨嚴重，美國所受威脅日見迫切的此際，素以英明果敢，雄才大略著稱的羅斯福總統，當然是應付今後大局的最適當人物。何况，根據過去羅氏八年任期內的言行，無一不證明他既有識，又有膽，是一個敢作敢爲，最知道如何保衛美國權益，如何伸張正義人道的民治國元首。自從法國戰敗，德義日進一步勾結以還，他不但在國防方面迅速地有所成就，如（一）任命諾克斯爲海長，史汀生爲陸長，以積極推行國防政策，（二）通過各種擴軍程序，（三）提高全國軍備製造能力，允其是飛機出產數量，（四）實施徵兵法。更在外交方面，大刀闊斧，毅然有所作爲，如（一）實行美國與加拿大聯防，（二）與英國訂立協定，以驅逐艦五十艘換得大西洋各英屬根據地的租借權，（三）積極援助中國，推行更明朗更堅强的遠東政策，以答覆日本的恫嚇。惟其羅氏已有如許成績，遂使共和黨在競選運動中對於現政府所發出的種種指摘頗似「無的放矢」，因爲就大體上講，除了在內政上經濟上，威爾基或者別有抱負外，其在外交與國防方面之一切主張，和羅斯福的實除行動，至多不過程度上的差異而已，根本上是沒有什麼分別的；所以退一步講，即使威爾基競選勝利，他對於積極擴軍和援助中英兩方政策，必定蕭規曹隨，一仍舊貫的。問題是羅斯福過去所作所爲，已是舉世共見的事實，而威爾基所鼓吹的，却還是尙未兌現的支票罷了。</p>
<p>綜上所述，在這選舉的前夕，吾人雖不敢斷言羅斯福的必能當選，但無疑地却相當佔有優勢，（當然，意外的結果在美國大選中，並不是絕對不可能的事）因為，誠如紐約州長賴伽弟亞所云：「美國人民母寗信賴羅斯福已明瞭的過錯，而不願嘗試威爾基未知數的優點」，這句話似乎很可代表美國大部份的民意。</p>

<p>我在凡爾賽附沂布克地方，乘坐英國飛機，飛到亨登飛機塲降落，立卽往見法國聯絡員，由其領到英國情報部。其時情報部當局正在招待新聞記者，我到得很湊巧。主席外交部代表皮克卽把我推上講壇說：「你的使命旣在宣布法國情形，此刻正是一個極好機會。英國全國報界人物都在道裹，請你就盡情宜佈吧。」</p>
<p>我却不知道怎樣措辭才好，事先毫無準備，卽在平時，我的英語，又沒有出口成章的本領。但在這一天，我爲了法國所遭遇的不幸，教爲了迫在眉睫的可怕前途，我受着極大的感動，我的言辭竟會滔滔不絕。我演說纔畢，在座三百位新聞記者全體起立，掌聲不絕，使我大爲驚異。我不相信以前曾有何人以法國處境惡劣的情形，這樣坦白地吿訴過他們，並且說明英國的援助如何急不容緩，非有英國援手，法國就無法支持下去了。</p>
<p>未幾，我由英國情報部次官尼哥爾遜和皮克引往晤見情報部長特夫古柏。彼此中張我把方才所說的，在無綫電中向英國民衆重說一番，就在這一夜英國廣播公司允以「最佳的時刻」，卽在晚間九時十五分「補助報吿」時刻，供我利用。</p>
<p>我便忽促寫成一篇稿子，最後的一段如下：</p>
<p>「我們法國人的朋友，若要幫助我們，不在一九四一年，不在今年秋天，也不能遲至下月，祗有「現在」。我們深知英國陸軍和空軍的光榮戰績，他們已經竭盡所能了。爲其所不可能，此其時矣。我們對於不列顚同盟國，完全信任。我們知道他們將傾其所有，以從事戰爭。我們所請求他們的，無非要他們明白「時間」的重要。請再振作所謂「鄧扣克精神」吧！當鄧扣克退兵之前，一般人以爲要在幾天之內從半成廢墟的海港撤退，決不能超過三萬人，就是最樂觀的人也以爲至多不過五萬罷了。然而事實上獲救的竟有三十三萬五千員名之多。究竟是怎樣做到的呢？還有什麼人比你們親歷其境的更明白嗎？假使你們再表現一次鄧扣克精神，你們也就能贏得這一仗，贏得這一役戰爭了。在鄧扣克，你們曾動員每一條船。現在請你們動員每一架飛機，每一個士兵和每一枝槍。讓我們一同請求極願援助我們的美國，請求他們把平時經年纔能製造完成的物品，在一個月之內，加速完成。專家們必將異口同聲地說，要在短短數星期之內，訓練，配備，和派遣一支大軍，乃是不可能的事。這句話固然不錯，但是無論如何，不可能，這事一定要做到，也一定能够做到的。……」</p>
<p>英國廣播公司請我再在早晨兩點鐘用法文重複向加拿大廣播一次，第二天再向英國各學校播音一次。我兩日未眠，精神萎頓，但我得悉英國民衆對我的請求反響極快，使我快慰異常。此後數天，我接到無數書函，並接見大枇訪者，他們願望一致，無非是說：「我們願章幫助法國。我們應如何幫忙呢？</p>
<p>我深知英國輿論都要政府採取更堅强的措置；可是善意畢竟不能代替飛機戰車。</p>
<p>我對我的朋友們說：「這些書囪和慰問使人感奮。但到底你們能够給我們些什麼呢」</p>
<p>我們的面色頓時顯着嚴重窘迫。</p>
<p>他們同答道：「除了甫自英倫開拔的加拿大軍一師外，我們已經沒有在大陸上作戰的軍隊了。我們在法蘭德一役，損失太重，補充不及。我們自當派遣飛機數隊到法國助戰，但有一點我們也不能忽略，我們的飛機製造廠和海港，是不能不妥爲保護的。只要你們能支持到一九四一年……」</p>
<p>我知道這一局巳是失敗了！我知道法國已是沒有希望了</p>
<p>我和法國駐英大使考平會面，他在這艱苦時期，始終能抱着勇氣。我對他說：「戰爭歷時已十個月，英國竟已無兵可調，豈不離奇。」</p>
<p>他却回答道：「不錯，但我們須作持平之論。他們對於所訂的盟的，確已信守不渝，英軍師團的編成，協定上曾有明文，規定限期，他們並未愆期。錯誤是在簽訂盟的時我們所要求英國應派的師團不及一九一四年時的多，但我們未曾要求過他們，却是事實。我們的防錢和防禦力被人誇張得像神話一般，把我們參謀部和部長們的耳目都朦蔽住了。」</p>
<p>十三日早晨，報載德軍已逼近巴黎。當我正在憂心如焚地閱讀泰晤士報時，電話忽然響了，並且有一女侍通知我，十一點鐘，皇后在白金漢宮接見。伊利沙伯后前爲約克公爵夫人時，和我曾有一面之雅，此後她以皇后身分駕游巴黎時，我父曾見過她一面，但我不知道這次荷蒙寵召，究竟所爲何事。宮門衛士，個個身材高大，穿着紅色制服，宮中到處懸着紀念照片，和陳設着竹製傢具，依然顯出女皇維多利亞時代景象。</p>

<p>— 聖凱</p>
<p>中美貿易的發展</p>
<p>據美國商務部的報吿，今年中美間的貿易大見繁榮，較之一九三六年爲發展。試一分析統計數字，今年九個月累積數中國輸往美國的貨値是七〇，四七二，〇〇〇美元，較之去年同期增加百分之七十四，而較之一九三六年正常的貿易情况也增加百分之十六之多。同時美國輸至中國的貨值是六二，二五〇，〇〇〇美八十。計中國的出超數由去年的五百萬美允增加爲今年的八百萬美元。據專家稱，由中國運往美國的大量生絲與桐油底價値的高漲，乃中國貿易牧支形成出超的主要原因，而美國輸至中國的貨物則大部份爲棉花與烟草等。</p>
<p>按自中日間三年戰爭以來，非但中國因日本的侵略性的對鎖，輸出極爲困難；卽是美國對中國的貿易，也因在華權益橫這摧殘，不易發展。然而在中美兩國當局不斷的努力下，今年的貿易成績，竟能不受戰事的影響，大見繁榮，且勝過戰前二九三六年）的正常的貿易情形，足見日本雖有能力對鎖中國的鬥戶，而中美却能共同努力開關中國的新鬥戶，以發展中美間的貿易。</p>
<p>輸出貿易的增加，本來能加强國家的財當，而戰時輸出貿易的增加，則殊能加强抗戰的力量。今中國的輸出貿易在輸入貿易相抵銷之下，尙能有大量的有利的貿易出超，無疑的可見中國抗戰經濟力的雄厚。</p>
<h3 id="c66">公債上昇的原因 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>公債行市目七月底發息之後，卽見挺秀，在八月二十六日金融述評中已分析當時高翔的原因。自九月以迄十月底的兩個月中，行市上升，甲種要達到七十元大關，其他各債亦遠在六十元關以上或在六十元關口。（下列數字乃月初收盤行市）：</p>
<p>以甲·乙·丙·丁·戊順序而言，計九月初較十月初升六·五·九·八·八%，十月初較十一月初升四·六·四·五，％，而自九月初以迄十一月初，共升一〇·二·一三·一三·一三%，漲風之厲，蓋可想見。　（未完）</p>

<p>花生油現貨仍由港幫採辦、二則靑島市報微升、良以人心瘋在、多頭加碼、空方抵補、業內外打成一片、致買氣喧囂、行情頻騰、中途雖有跌撲、但結果仍比上日價高砌三元外、統共做開江北本坊生油三百聽、價爲九十九元、膠州油千餘件、價爲七十一元半、步升至七十三元五角、收盤爲七十三元、訂十一月下交四百件、價爲七十三元至七十五元、靑島油二百桶、價爲一百元至零一元半、訂十一月下交一千六七百桶、價爲一百元至零三元五角、收盤爲零三元二角半、十二月下交二千桶、價爲一百零一元二角半至零四元半、曾回挫至零三元七角半、收盤復至四元、</p>
<p>今日有豆子二千零十包運香港、昨日由天津來桐油五百聽又四十件、</p>

<p>紗市依然疲弱、此因實需停滯、而人心大都轉變、傾向下風、至於一般金子帮及滙票商、善於投機、目標隨趨勢爲轉移、所以跌了還要看跌、漲了越要拖進、就此一來、市價往往造成超越軌外行動、而近來放出消息皆屬利空者爲夥、今日有棉紗二千〇三十五件運港</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣尚和平、廿支雙馬價為一千一百八十五元、微漲至一千一百八十九元、旋後聞外滙掛牌、長風復現、情况回挫、跌至一千一百七十三元、此時空頭抵補、又升上至一千一百八十二元、但實際交易寥落不堪、依然下降至一千一百六十二元、獲利者乘賤補進、又昂起至一千一百七十元、查半日間成交統計五千〇〇五包、行情二十支變馬跌二十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分別如左、</p>

<p>現棉情形、依然平庸無力、實緣紗市慘落之故、廠胃閉塞、且昔日購訂之印棉、不日准期可抵滬矣、平果爾價一百七十三元、彭義浦　百六十二元至二百六十元、常陰沙二百二十一元云、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日先因投機者之購買而漲、後因大衆之賣出、一部份多頭了結、結果收盤價格、較之上日降落三五磅香不等、印度昨日連同預測降一羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來始終靜寂異常、各方咸抱觀望態度、期貨交易、日來亦未聞做開、同業間之心思、確仍異常高昂也、</p>

<p>頃據市　調查所得、近日紗市大落之因素、（一）蜀省紗市在落一千元以外、（二）原棉稍有來源、（三）客幫旺辦後轉入呆滯之途、（四）報載日眾撤退、（五）外滙長風益厲、（六）藍鳳標紗因十六支紗交貨充足、且套進利鈿頗厚、有此以上之說素、市態傾向下風、</p>

<p>昨日洋米市因市傳國軍節節勝利、一般囤戶遂覺心餒、多所拋出、同時因洋米有整批抵埠、途貨亦有大量將到、加以國外定價、仍以滙鬆見劃、市上供過於求、回籠原包竟乏人顧問、懷貨者至欲求脫手、故各價節節下游、直迄收市未稍回頭、統計收盤價較前貶落一元之譜、一號新西貢六十六元至六十五元半、二號六十一元二角至六十元零五角、火絞六十四元二角、六十三元、眞特別六十七元六角、二號　　五十九元半、五十八元半、小紋五十九元、五十八元七角、碎尖五十一元、五十元、米茶五十四元五十三元、次五十二元、東京砶尖五十八元三角、蕪湖尖五十八元三角、午後賣氣甚濃、浮戶求脫而乏接受、價又小三四五角、結果比前晚較小一元三四角、成交不足四千包、因客囤兩寂、店戶亦以平糶中見淡、新交易續有七百噸成交、小絞開七十元、二號西貢七十一元、均下月裝船、</p>
<p>新粳尖及窰種野稻等米、到貨仍祇千餘石、而早市銷塲、因一般作客承上日漲勢、互相採納殊見旺盛、當時貨主扳俏異常、喊聲迭起、無論粳尖各色行情、悉漲半元至一元、計開新粳原包七十九元、七十八元半、斛見七十四元半、七十三元、窰種八十元次至七十八元、野稻八十元七十八九元、杜尖解見六十八元半、次之六十六元、原包七十元、羊尖斛見六十八元、原包亦售七十元、不過近午洋米疲跌影響所及、市色已屬回軟、售價與前相仿、破磬仍無市、糯米酒戶及飯担去路依然寥落、致價並爲帶疲五六角至　砠不等、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨市大致疲定、查　號粉廠盤仍爲十七元、兩廠批出八九千包、適合本街日常之需用、回籠貨以受主缺乏及米價回高聲中、一般貨主復有扳守待機之意、故老車　單已站定十八元八角、其餘各牌洋粉亦以定粉到期、最早須在十天以後、故行情亦站定十九元左右、但無正式做開、聞日廠粉鳳凰牌回籠貨做開二百包、價十七元四角、市面亦殊平淡、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易依然沉靜、因値週末之期、華廠與其他走銷均吿停滯、僅日廠方面偶有數十百包之近郊麥解送、作價仍爲二十一元左右、</p>
<h3 id="c73">疋頭　棉布心思交易　無形停頓 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>廠布　人氣不振、客戶　存觀望、交易稀少、惟執貨者態度鎭定、故跌風尙形緩和、白貨粗細布斜紋跌每疋二角半至五角、漂染布一部份跌價每疋五角之譜、本街成交各貨二百餘件、心思囤藏生意、無形停頓、浙閩帮辦色斜粗細布一百餘件、粵港帮辦色布漂染布等二百餘件、北路烟台幫辦粗布絨布等一百餘件、三日有疋頭一千八百四十件運香港、四十五件運烟台、</p>
<p>東布　跌風續厲、白貨龍頭細布晨開三十五元、一般小額浮戶心慌傾賣、降至三十四元四角、嗣以同業大戶仍鎮靜不動、後市開盤回升至三十四元九角、終因買戶缺乏、又降至三十四元五角、較前日細布續跌每疋一元、細斜跌五角至七角半、嗶嘰收盤爲一元零七分半、亦跌每碼四分二五、然行廠售盤堅持如故、蓋聞各行直接裝輸華北及長江一帶者、以現下减工期內之出數、尙不敷傾銷、故凡華商裝運、一再加以限制云、</p>

<p>美國務院遣派前來遠東撤僑之專輪三艘、（原爲四艘、惟曼哈丹輪並未開出、）其第一艘馬遜郵船公司之蒙德萊號、已於昨日下午三時左右駛泊浦江中第十一·十二號浮筒、據悉、船中有在日本上船之婦孺五十八人、預定本市乘該輪撒退者、將有三百餘人、此中多數爲美海軍麥令隊及使領館人員之眷屬、總數不致超過五百人、預定今日午夜（卽四日上午一時）啟椗離滬、其行程經昨日郵船公司布吿、已略有變史、決不靠香港、直放馬尼刺、載由該處撤退之美僑、然後駛至澳洲、將有一百四十人在該處登岸、至舊金山目的地登陸者、聞僅三百五十人左右而已、</p>
<p>馬遜派員　隨船到滬</p>
<p>馬遜公司爲愼重起見、特命培平氏（Piplni率領四人、隨輪來滬、輔助美國總統公司辦理船票手續、船票及各種單據均由培氏帶來、美國總統公司事前收受乘客之票價、係出臨時收據、定今晨調換馬遜公司正式船票、該輪到滬後、總統公司滬行大二班登輪歡迎培氏、卽偕另外之四員、同乘小輪至新關碼頭登陸、赴公司小憩、並將客票手續昨晚連夜辦理妥當、俾便今晨調換、故昨日船到後、總統公司客票部中西職員、忙碌異常、又培平氏等四人、不乘蒙德萊輪回國、將在滬小作勾留、俟瑪利波薩號來滬後、隨該輪返美、</p>
<p>船上旅客　登岸游覽</p>
<p>昨日下午二時卅分、當蒙德萊號郵船抵滬時、渡輪迎之而前、船上依欄而望者、不足十二人、當時一班新聞記者與攝影家、蜂擁而上、或則手執鉛筆遇人卽問、或則手持攝影機、往來覓取鏡頭、走廊中貯立旅客的有一百五十餘人、靜待離船之許可令、以便乘渡輪抵埠上岸環遊、其時各記者主要之發問、爲「君以前會來過上海吾」、大多數均答稱「未」、又據乘該船撤退美僑之一談、旅居日本之美僑、約有一萬四千名、現正靜候美國國內總統競選之結果如何、然後再作撤離遠東之決定、惟大多數業已經申請預定艙位矣、</p>
<p>僑日美婦　溫談觀感</p>
<p>客居日本之美籍婦女、以受日方宣傳、大多不願離其丈夫而返國、因大批撤退之舉、是否必要、彼等以爲尙屬疑問、此次少數離日返美之婦女、大部係受其丈夫之迫促、而不得不行者、某一中年美籍婦人稱、「余之返國、乃因遲早必須返居祖國之故、其實余抵美後、將不知何所適從、但余料在余抵美時、余之丈夫將有信吿知余如何行止也、」又一婦人稱、伊僅於郵船駛行前之三日內、方決定作歸國之計、該婦人手挈七齡男孩、伊之理想在蒙德萊號抵舊金山時、彼或可在該地晤及其良人、蓋彼之良人現雖留居東京、必要時、得以隨時收拾行裝離日返美、「又一年輕少女與其幼弟同輪返國、「余不知此去將何所之、但余且已行矣、抵美時、余之親友將迎候余歸、故余並無所慮、」但大多數經記者叩詢之婦女、均不知此行返國後將作何生涯、蓋彼等離日之前、行期甚促、無暇鎖定返美後之計劃也、</p>
<p>此後兩輪　去者必多</p>
<p>據記者調查所悉、蒙德萊所有艙位、可容旅客六百九十五人、但日本上海兩地撒退僑民、僅有其半數、因其須繞道澳洲、然後返美、其旅程長至二個月、故多數美僑不願乘該船返國、預料本市預備奉行美國務院命令而實行撤退之美僑、大部將於本月中下旬、乘馬列波薩號或華盛頓號離滬、以美政府對無力撤退僑民之救濟辦法、旣已宣佈、屆時撤退者、將必增多也、按馬列波薩號將於十日、華盛頓號將於十九日、先後抵滬、</p>
<p>政府資助　困難解除</p>
<p>本市美僑接美國務院頃已滙出小額款項、用以撤退遠東貧困美僑之訊、大感寬慰、據美總領署發言人昨晨聲稱、國務院撥出之款不巨、但已足解決本市薪給低微或赤貧美僑之撤退問題云、又據美商會方面稱、國務院宣布予以經濟上援助及减低華盛頓號票價、則整個撤僑問題、現已解決、預料遠東全體美僑、無論有無斧資、不久皆可撤退、</p>

<p>答詞已窮　不再討論</p>
<p>另一美籍記者問、射擊之日機共五架、豈能均有錯失乎、發言人謂、五機皆係戰鬥機、每機僅一人、某記者對此答語、仍感不滿、乃謂日方駕駛員旣係曾受訓練之飛行員、應知民用運輸機與華方戰鬥機有何區別、况此種區別、卽使平民亦能道之乎、另一美籍記者接言曰、不僅此也、運輸機皆有淸晰標記美方乃中航公司股東、欲知日方對運輸飛機之政策如何、發言人答稱、渠感覺不能討論此事矣、</p>

<h3 id="c105">美國選舉的機械化 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>後天十一月五日爲美國大選之期。屆時大的有四千六百萬人投票，決定民主黨羅斯福總統連任，或共和黨候選人威爾基當選。在這樣大的國家，總統選舉的手續，自極繁重。單看美國選舉第一任大總統華盛頓時，祇有少數選舉人在便利的所在投票，在若干處地方，遲至三星期後，始得知華盛頓當選。然而這一次的大選結果，却祗耍在封歷後三小時，全世界各地就可得知，其神速較之往昔，其相去眞不可以道里計了。</p>
<p>欲求選舉結果的迅速揭曉，其先決條件卽在計算票數與報吿消息二者之間，獲得最簡便和最高度的速率。美國現在已能利用科學方法，達得這個目的。選舉時之正確簡便及快速三者，實爲美國獨得之秘，而足以自豪於民主國之間。</p>
<p>投票記錄器，其歷史最久的一種，歐洲於十九世紀中葉已有之。當時德國係用黑球和白球，以代表票數。大發明家愛迪生於一八六九年曾造成一架投票記錄器，這是美國有這種機器的嚆矢。英國也曾有人造過這種東西。</p>
<p>其後漸次改良，把投票和統計二者，合在一架機器之內。發明者爲西西里島雪密那地方維多利多神甫。他的機器係一隻大箱子，裹面根據候選人數分爲若干小格，計算器的指針一轉，那裏面就鈴聲大震。不久之後，美國完全以機械構造的方法，造成投票選舉器。其中有一種爲麥克泰枚所製，每個候選人都有一個關鍵，不相混合。並利用空氣機計算紙條上所扛的孔洞數目。</p>
<p>目下美國所用的投票選舉機，在實際上爲機械化的票匭。每一架機器之前有簾幔遮蔽。其前面分爲若干列，每列代表一黨，所有各籬的候選人，每人以一個橫桿代表，上面寫着他的名字。投票人選舉時，先撥動左面的機鈕。選出某黨的一列，然後以指示針對準他所欲選者的人名，拖動上面所懸的握柄，投票卽算了事。這樣一拖之後，被選者卽多了一票，並同時把他所得的總票數計算好。一人過去之後，指示針和簾幔都恢復原狀，以待第二人之選舉。</p>
<p>這種選舉機的好處計有六端：（一）用機械準確計算，可避免人爲之錯誤。（二）可立卽獲得總票數之統計。（三）避免廢票。（四）可獲得永久之紀錄，母需重數或複計。（五）可减少選舉之費用。（六）對選舉完全保守機密。在此六項優點之外，所稍感缺憾者，就是第一次的購置費却頗可觀。而且機身相當龐大，運費棧租等，亦頗不少。最小一種之選舉機，可容候選人二百七十個名字，每隻需費美金八百元。較大者售價亦照加。最大之一種可包括九黨，每黨候選人可多至七十名。另有「是」或「否」之提議統計器台裝於內。如投票人所欲選之人，其姓名不列於機上者，可另繕姓名於紙條上，此種紙條亦附裝於選舉器之上。此項選舉機如於事前詳加檢查，事後妥爲封存，並派若干眼明手快之監視人在旁察看，當無弊竇及錯誤可言。此種選舉機之使用上雖尙不能稱爲盡善盡美，但大體上於快速正確及簡便三者，已具極大之效果，故其使用極爲普遍。卽非選舉總統，如平時之工黨或學校選舉時，利用此機者，亦實繁有徒。</p>
<p>美國地區廣大，各地間的時間頗有差別，故選舉時總是由東徂西，麥色鳩雪茲州的紐阿許福村，常以辦理選舉最快，自鳴得意。自一九一二年至一九三六年間，這「錦標」老是爲這村所得。當大選舉之日，各小地方的總數在當天下午報紙上已可揭曉。但最大的數目全靠紐約城和紐約州的。這兩方面的總數結出後，競選人的命運大半已經決定了。這兩處的總數須遲至早晨始得獲悉。紐約州有四十七蔡選舉權，較任何州爲多。二十四年以來，凡爲紐約州所中意的候選人，總沒有失敗過哩。</p>
<p>所有紐約市一百七十萬選票，均由四千三百架選舉機所記錄。此外其他地方的二百十萬選票，亦用同樣方法訊錄。一待紐約　選舉事畢而封匭後，派在各選舉塲維持秩序的警察，立刻把各選舉所記錄的總數，通知區選舉處。各地方報或通訊社的新聞記者老早都等待在那里，一待總數揭曉，立刻把消息拍發各地。</p>
<p>除紐約市　，紐約州各地的警察，在選舉時亦帮同服務。布法羅城爲紐約州中第二個最大城市，當選舉之日，城郊的警察乘着機器脚踏車，入城中心，一路把選舉總數收集攏來，全城約有二十一萬八千人投票，候選者的數目亦非常鉅大，然而在九十分鐘之內，可辦理完全一切的選舉手續，而獲得最後的總結束。要不是利用機械方法，何能如此神速呢。所以紐約州全州的總揭曉，在封匭後兩小時內，卽爲大衆所獲悉。</p>
<p>紐約州爲利用選舉機的先進，對於一切選舉手續，極力提倡機械化，故其辦理迅速實爲意料中事。紐約州所最早用的選舉機爲美猶氏式，一八九二年時，卽在發明人的故鄕洛克堡脫最早便用。卡則諾維亞，和羅吉士說於一八九四年依次採用選舉機。至一八九九年布法羅和其地二城市亦利用此機。紐約城則於一九二五年華克市長任內，下命採用選舉機。現在紐約州所用的選舉機總數已超過了三萬架了。</p>
<p>在未用選舉機之前，市民投票時所用的選舉票，其間亦曾經過若干的改革。最初各黨各派都自己各用各的選舉票，其後因有弊竇，便進步而改爲統一式者。然而市民們尙有不識字者，根本不能備舉某黨或某人的姓名。於是在各黨派之間，用圖畫作爲標議。（目下亦有用之者）這些圖畫眞像卡通畫家手下的巨象或　子。據最近調查，共和黨的標識爲鷹，美國旗，旗上的林肯像，和一間小木屋。民主黨者爲引頸而鳴之牡雞，自由神像，鷹，　，星及一手握着的旗。有許多人都表示反對，以爲這樣簡實在侮辱投票人，叫他們去選舉禽鳥巨象了。</p>
<p>如果不用選舉機的話，市民們投票完畢，對於選舉還只完成了一半的工作。因爲投票之後，尙須開票，須用幾個人來做，唱名，記錄，點數等總總的麻煩，波士頓的投票人數的及紐約城的五分之一。因爲不用選舉機的緣故，每選舉一次，須化了四十八小時的工作時間，才能獲得各候選人所得的票數。底特律城五十萬的投票人，每選舉一次須經一天牛工夫才能完事。</p>
<p>凡是小地方的選舉票數，雖未經公佈，常由通訊社，像合衆，美聯，萬國，及泛無綫電通訊社等統計，送到州都會或大城市中：較大地方則將總數先彙送至區選舉塲。及至總數獲得以後，立卽用無綫電，電報等通知各地報紙加以公佈。</p>
<p>一九四〇年在選舉上尚有利用科學的一點，而為往年所未見的，那就是「電視」機，使遠處小地方的選舉者，得以隨時看見大城市中總選舉的實在進行狀况。這比了選舉機的構造尤覺完美可喜了。</p>

<p>— 道中小學　朱本和</p>
<p>我最愛看的書，是「世界五大領袖」，這五位偉人，都是平民出身，而達到最光榮的地位，眞值得我們欽佩的，尤其是我國的總裁，—蔣介石將軍，他一生的事業，都是為民族奮門，爲國家爭光，最後使他建立了偉大的功續，使將來的人，都能享受到他的恩澤。</p>
<p>蔣總裁是浙江奉化縣人，小時就有高尙的志氣，和偉大的人格，並受賢母的敎育，打定了他一身事業的基礎，九歲時，就進學校讀書，非常用功。</p>
<p>當時的中國外受帝國主義的侵略，內有專制政府的暴戾，這時一般有志的靑年，都抱着爲國犧牲的大志，而蔣先生更是個熱心愛國的人物，於是他就抱定救國救民的決心，加入軍官學校肄業，後又留學日本，專攻軍事學，以爲從事革命的基礎。他回國後，卽奔走革命，允共是在北伐時，建立了特殊的功勳，他所到之處，人民無不歡迎。</p>
<p>民國二十五年，蔣總裁在西安蒙難，他那種不屈不撓的精神，眞令人欽佩，由此可見其大無畏的精神，認定世界上任何威力，絕不能搖動其建國的計策，中華民國之有今日，實在是總裁精神主義二者之結晶，我們應追溯前事，具有充分崇拜心理，而奉爲我們的模範。</p>
<p>唉！七七抗戰以來，已逾三載，凡我國同胞應擁護最高領袖，一心一德，集中力量，共赴國難，以求取最後勝利。</p>

<h3 id="c108">飛機天空寫字 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>

<p>一個飛行員駕了飛機，上入天空，到了兩英里或三英里的高度，在蔚藍的天空中，用白烟來寫成一種商標或標語，他一定要具備超人的駕駛術。同時，這架飛機在高空中一定要能够很自在的飛行。</p>
<p>駕了飛機，要想到天空中去寫字，關於設備方面，在尾部的前面要裝一個特殊的油箱，裏面儲藏一種輕量的石蠟油，就用這種油來寫字的。道種油由於一種神秘的化學物品的攙入，寫了字烟浮在天空中，能够凝在一起，不是馬上散開。另外有一架引擎，用力把油噴射出來，注進一個排汽管。在那排汽管裏，熱力就可使油化成濃厚的白烟。油的灌人，可一如飛行員的需要，但他一定要記到每一次把汽塞關閉，所注入的油量，祇能寫二十呎長的烟字。</p>
<p>在駕機騰空之前，飛行員先要把想在天空寫的字或圖繪成一個草樣，放在表板上。這種字或圖是反寫的，而打一而鏡子裏看的，因爲他所寫的是給下面的人看的。預備要到天空中寫字時，他上升到一萬呎或一萬五千呎的高度，尋找一個地方，那邊的空氣囊不致影響於所寫的烟字的，然後再開始寫字。</p>
<p>因爲飛機的推進桿，把空氣激盪得飄動了，會把寫的烟字揩去，所以飛行員當布天空寫宇時，一定要注意到勿跨越自己寫過字的地方。關於這點，他寫了一筆，一定要向上衝刺，高過五十呎以後，再寫一筆，這樣直到寫完爲止。</p>
<p>在某些受到限制的飛行員，他們以爲不必要成爲最好的天空寫字者。其實在天空寫字，並不是一種危險的工作，主要的一點就在氣候晴朗，所駕的飛機是非常超特的。而飛行員具有特殊的天空寫字技巧，比勇敢更重要。這原因，在一般的飛行員中，會在天空寫字人數並不多，祇可數的幾個。總之，要造成天空寫字的人才，也不是一件容易的事，不要說中國，就是歐美各國怕也不多呢。</p>

<p>到得一放了學，庸兒老是喜歡到外面去玩，而家裏雖先到一到，立刻把書包放掉，就一溜烟的出去了。他母親總時常叫他喝一杯開水，吃一些點心，稍坐定一下，有時更叫他在太陽還沒有落散時候，光綫比較明亮，便乘此可先把功課預備好了，再去暢暢快快的玩。那知庸兒，把這話當作耳邊風，很少有效力，依舊我行我素。等到他玩到了日落西山後，天色在將黑未黑當兒，才想着回家。這時離開吃晚飯的時間尙早，於是他便想去預備功課，可是那時的光綫，不宜工作了，卽使要做，是很勉强的，他不管三七廿　的寫起字來，有時開了燈，在日光帶火光之下預備功課。不料，有一天被地父親看見了，便開口說道：「在這樣暗的光綫之下，可以寫字的嗎？剛才你爲什麼不寫？你預備將來戴眼鏡嗎？而且這樣的寫，怎樣可以練好字？你對於光綫的常識一些也沒有？」</p>
<p>「爸爸」，我不寫了。那麼爸爸可能講些關於光綫的常識嗎？」</p>
<p>「我就講些，光可分自然和人工兩方面，自然的光，就是由太陽直接射來的光綫，而人工的，就是燈光，燭光和各種東西燒起來都有光，不過這人工光也都由太陽光而來的，所以一切光的基本根源，便是太陽。光是直錢進行的，所以叫它光錢。要是它從空氣中到水中，便發生曲折的現象。各種東西的顏色和我們能看見各種束西，都必需光。最後要講到讀書是需要怎樣的光度，才不致傷害我們的眼睛？在解決這個問題之前，你可知道燭光是什麼意思？我想你不會知道，就吿訴你吧。譬如電燈泡上不是刻上這是二十五W，我們叫它二十五支燭光，就是有一種標準蠟燭，（它是用鯨魚的蠟製成）在一點鐘內燃燒七·七八克這時的光稱爲一支燭光。我們在晚上讀書，大概以五十米燭（一米燭就是一支燭光的光源能照着一米（三英尺）距離的東西時的那種光度（的光度最適宜，就是離開燈一米，需要五十支燭光。在白天，那陽光當很明亮，不過它射來的方向，最好自左面而來所以你的書桌放得道樣。如果由前後或右方而來，對於眼睛不大適宜。最要注意的，讀書時，陽光切不可直接射到書面上，否則書倒看到沒有多少頁，而眼睛已發花了。這於你很有害處。」</p>

<p>爸爸仍在綠杉磯的銀行中担任經理之職。我家的一切情形不但並未變壞，反而漸漸地變好起來。他曾對人家說，現在上銀行來的人，已比從前加多了不少，唯一，的原因，是爲的他們要瞧瞧秀蘭鄧波兒的父親是怎樣一個人。後來他們見爸爸的模樣兒倒很不錯，於是紛紛的都來存放錢鈔了。只爲銀行中的業務發達，爸爸的薪水也大大的增加了，他心中快樂得什麼似的。</p>
<p>傑克也在打主意，不知道自己將來的出路，還是做醫生好呢，還是做工程師好。照我的意思，他還是做醫生的好，如此他可以提住了人家的手，看他的手錶哩。可甘，他現在是上史丹福大學讀書去了。</p>
<p>生南還不知道他將來做什麼才好，因爲他還只十六歲哩。也在新墨西哥一所學校中讀書，穿着一身陸軍學生的制服，瞧上去是挺神氣的。每逢假期，他總得回到家裏來。去年夏季，他回來說，打算辦一個牧塲，鎮日的騎着馬跑來跑去。但他先前是想跟爸爸一樣，去做銀行家的。他的主意，隨時在變動，所以還決不定他將來到底幹什麽事呢。</p>
<p>但是傑克和生南無論如何，決不想做電影明星，因爲他倆是不會歌唱，也不會跳舞的。本來他們可以在「大衛考伯飛爾」一片中各充一個角色，導演曾來邀請他們上攝影塲中試一試鏡頭，誰知他們一得了消息，立刻逃也似的溜出屋子去，連人家和他們說一句話也來不及。他們倆對於我的成功，倒也引以爲榮，不過他們的心目裏，仍瞧我是一個小妹妹羆了。我們一同在家裹用餐的時候，傑克仍是搶着最大的一塊餅兒吃，我自己要是不吃得快一些，那麼我的一塊，也許要被他或生南搶去了。傑克平日仍喚我小妹。</p>

<p>— 張渴雲</p>
<p>慕爾堂近成立衛斯理團，仿照美國制度（按衛斯理是人名，乃領導美國最偉大之靑年組織者，全國分佈團員不下四五百萬人）創立涵養高尙品性之靑年業餘組織，名之曰衛斯理團，成立伊始，在上海一埠，已得團員四五千人，近又成立一歌詩班，加入者雖爲團昌，但須受宗敎洗禮，（對於音樂有涵養，對宗敎有認識者為限）全班計五十人分四部份，女高音唱Soporno，女低音唱Altas男高音唱Tenor，男低音唱Base四音同時和聲齊唱，殊覺壯嚴肅穆，筆者加入該班，四月有餘，自意對於個人品性涵養，借此大可默移，內心靈修，裨益尤多，且聖詩立意高尙，文句雅潔，發音沈遠抑揚，深奧曲折，較諸普通音樂，固不可同日而語，其至誠之感人，有足多者。班中規定每星期五晚舉行練習唱奏，星期日晨領導主日禮拜，各界有此興趣者均可加入，雖對宗敎無甚認識，但音樂歌唱之感應，人同此旨也。本班在上星期日下午在馬斯南路特二監獄舉行聖詩歌唱，又至某醫院對病人舉行聖詩慰籍，成績均極美滿，深得富局嘉許，蓋本班人員，男者皆爲業餘靑年，大學學生，女者均爲中西女塾金陵神學院，國立音專等各校高村生，樂趣均極高尙，且志同道合，滿望在業餘課後之暇，藉對社會作一番貢獻云。</p>

<p>金素琴領導之「中華劇團」已自西貢返滬，此次該團在海外出演，劇目都爲歐陽予倩之改良平劇，若「梁紅玉」「桃花扇」「漁夫恨」等。售座成績平平，第一，根本越南僑胞十九不諳舊劇。第二，上演未久，正逢越南風雲緊張。但金素琴此次幹了一件大好事，會帶回大批流落異鄉之唱戲同行，緣兩年前尹聲濤嘗組一劇團遠赴安南，旋以經濟拮据解散，尹聲濤本人轉赴暹邏，遂使大批班底流落異域，生活困難，金素琴慈悲心動，斥資代購船票，率之歸來，第一批計十五人，第二批尙有三十餘人。此輩落難同行到滬後，卽向伶界聯合會報吿伶聯會當局以金素琴好事做得不小，遂於昨日開會歡迎，昔日伶聯會以金孃新得厲害，似有格格未入，而今而後，當能融洽無間矣。</p>

<p>— 鈞陶</p>
<p>「再生緣」並不是單純的一部人生悲劇。劇作者所以採用倒叙法（先寫狄鮑蒂來美執敎，再寫她受不了學生的暗譏而說出「再生緣」的內容），一方面固然是忠於原著，但是另一方面正表示着環境雖然惡劣，然而只要能够逆來順受，坦白地應付着一切的不幸，那末究竟勝利是屬於你的。正似當狄飽蒂講完她的故事後，每一個學生都向她請罪，都向她求恕一樣，她畢竟是克服了一切！</p>
<p>以內容言，「再生緣」的確是一張近年來少有的佳片，當觀業聽到那妒婦公爵夫人的聲音「……她跑到美國，我跟到美國她渡過海洋，我跟過海洋。我恨她，我忌她，……」每一個人的怒火在燃燒着；然而當聽到公爵的聲音「……你到什麼地方，我跟到你什麼地方。你是我心靈唯一的安慰……」狄鮑蒂聲音「……我有罪，公爵是沒有罪的……那四個孩子雖然不是我自己生的，然而我當爲他們是我自己的孩子一樣，而他們亦都愛我……」每一個觀眾父被深深的感動着了</p>
<p>導演安東尼李伐的手法的確是永久使人回憶着的。他處理全片旣緊張，又輕快；他抓住了每一個觀衆的情感，使觀衆沒有一刻透氣的機會。其餘値得稱道的，就是音樂的配合，這對於全片的空氣，有不少的幫助。</p>
<p>以個別塲面言，則幾個描寫公爵與夫人不和的鏡頭；雷納有病，狄鮑蒂爲之畫夜服侍；公爵與露蓋絲狄飽蒂觀劇；公爵對狄鮑蒂表示愛慕之意；以及最後公爵殺死夫人，公爵服毒自盡等爲最佳，是全片重心所繫！</p>
<p>却爾斯鮑育飾浦魯士林公爵，蓓蒂黛維絲飾狄鮑蒂，好極了！全片的戲，大半爲之包辦。白蓓蘭奧妮見飾公爵夫人，其潑刺妒忌的作風，値得稱道。傑黃林飾收師亨利，戲甚少，稱職而已。飾公爵二女兒露薏絲的維其妮偉特及四兒子雷納的李却逆克爾斯到是二個優越的演員。</p>

<p>Longzhou, 29th: The vanguard of the Chinese army in South China went straight to Pingxiang. The Japanese army attempted to resist, but by the 31st, the Chinese soldiers had defeated the Japanese and captured Pingxiang in one fell swoop. The remaining Japanese retreated towards Zhennanguan. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: According to a Chinese report here yesterday, more than 40,000 Japanese troops withdrew from Fangcheng on Thursday, presumably heading to Hainan Island. It is claimed that there are no longer any traces of the Japanese in Fangcheng. The report also stated that 1,000 Japanese troops operating on the highway between Qinzhou and Xiaodong were suddenly ambushed by the Chinese army from both flanks. It is rumored that the Japanese in Zhennanguan are also retreating, seemingly heading to Vietnam. It is also learned that the Japanese troops in Pingxiang, 40 miles from Longzhou, are also gradually weakening. It is said that they will also be transferred to Vietnam soon. It is understood that, except for a small number of Japanese troops still resisting the Chinese army's attacks in Pingxiang, there is no trace of the Japanese army in the entire Guangxi Province. On Thursday, the Chinese authorities dispatched 80 officials, police, and relief workers from Guilin to Nanning. These people arrived in Liuzhou yesterday and are expected to reach their destination today. It is rumored that they will conduct a population survey and provide relief. It is also learned that the security of Nanning is currently being temporarily maintained by the cooperation of the Chinese army and police. It is reported that the first step for the authorities in Nanning is to secure food supplies and find shelter for the refugees. In addition, the authorities will restore transportation and order, and offer amnesty to the people who were forced to work for the Japanese army. At the same time, the entire Guangxi Province is now celebrating and actively carrying out refugee relief work. Since the Japanese army entered Nanning, the price of rice transported from Binyang once soared, but yesterday it fell back to 17 yuan per stone. This indicates that the people have great confidence in the rapid recovery of the city. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: General Zhang Fakui and the Chairman of Guangxi Province, Huang Xuchu, went to southern Guangxi today, carrying one million yuan to relieve 20 million people. They departed from Guilin to reach Nanning. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: According to news received here yesterday, a large number of Japanese planes heavily bombed Nanning yesterday. Japanese planes flew over Nanning four times yesterday, focusing their bombing on the city's hydroelectric plant. The plant was not destroyed when the Japanese army withdrew from the city. However, there were no reports of any losses as a result of the bombing. Today, Japanese reconnaissance planes flew over the city constantly, as many as ten times, causing great anxiety among the citizens. The Chairman of Guangxi Province, Huang Xuchu, stated today that the authorities have allocated five million yuan for relief work in Nanning. The authorities have also dispatched several special administrative officers to Nanning to carry out this work. It is understood that they have taken office yesterday. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: Nanning, Longjin, Mingjiang, Suilu and other places have been successively recovered. The Provincial Government deeply sympathizes with the people who have been ravaged by the Japanese for nearly a year, and has formulated various relief plans to actively carry out appeasement work, and will adjust the various relief stations to handle relief and guide the people back to their hometowns, and send Huang Zhongwei to Longjin, Shangjin, Ningming, Mingjiang, Pingxiang and other places to inspect the situation of the revitalization affairs. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Ta Kung Pao here reported that it is believed that the Japanese troops withdrawing from Nanning were transferred to Taiwan, not Hainan Island. The Chairman of Guangxi Province plans to go to Nanning to supervise the relief work, taking with him 1.2 million yuan. The Guangxi Provincial Government is now requesting the National Government to allocate 3 million yuan for the reconstruction and relief of Nanning. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Guangxi Provincial authorities have recently applied to the National Government for an allocation of 3 million yuan for the reconstruction of transportation. According to Chinese sources, since the Japanese army withdrew from Nanning, there is no longer any Japanese army in the entire Guangxi Province. There are only a few remnants left on the Vietnamese border. Authoritative sources say that the Japanese troops who withdrew from Guangxi Province went to Taiwan rather than Hainan Island.

<p>Report from Hankou: Fire at Japanese Headquarters; Japanese Airfield Self-Destructed</p>
<p>Chongqing: Reliable news obtained by the transportation industry today confirms that a major fire broke out at the headquarters of the Japanese Central China Army in Hankou. It is said that this report comes after the news of a major fire in Yichang on Wednesday. According to investigation, this incident was caused by the Japanese army setting fire before their retreat, or by the Wang Jingwei army. It is also learned that the Japanese army destroyed the airfield they built in Xiaogan (transliteration), a few kilometers from Hankou. This statement has been confirmed by the transportation industry. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Tianjin: The strike by police in the Tianjin British Concession was resolved before 1 a.m. this morning. The striking police then resumed their duties as usual. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Police and door keepers in the British Concession refused to go to work at 5 p.m. yesterday. The Engineering Bureau convened business groups to patrol the streets overnight. According to unconfirmed reports, the strike had been brewing for a long time and suddenly erupted yesterday afternoon. It is believed that the strikers wanted better pay and demanded the dismissal of certain police officers. Special British police and business groups have been mobilized, so the concession remains as peaceful as usual despite the sudden outbreak of the strike. It is heard that some Chinese police opposed the strike but were threatened. No demands had been made beforehand. Two shifts of police officers at London Road Police Station went on strike. If the parties fail to reach a settlement through negotiation, other police officers will also resign. During the meeting, the Chief Executive of the Engineering Bureau, Tang Na, addressed the strikers in Chinese, which was applauded by the crowd. Tang Na then consulted with the Deputy Chief Executive, Mr. Zhuang. The nature of the demands made by the strikers has not yet been announced. It is believed that the person instigating the strike is a newly appointed liaison officer of the Xinminhui. While the negotiations were underway, many family members of the strikers gathered at the London Road Police Station. Police Chief Tainisi said that lower-ranking police officers had not joined the strike. If the strike does not spread, there is hope for a resolution. Just as the Police Chief finished speaking, a fire alarm came in, and firefighters were dispatched. It was then discovered that it was a false alarm. After the firefighters returned to the station, they heard that a fire had broken out opposite the concession and drove off again to put it out, only to find that it was another false alarm. Firefighters and paramedics are currently serving as usual. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The terms for the settlement of the strike in the British Concession here have not yet been officially announced. According to Chinese personnel at the police station, the strike was triggered by the delayed payment of salaries at the London Road Police Station. The police took this opportunity to present nine demands, including: (1) Increase police salaries to cope with the cost of living; (2) Pay police salaries on time and promptly; (3) No punishment for those who desert their posts; (4) Dismissal of certain police officers, etc. The British Engineering Bureau, recognizing the diligence of the Chinese police in their service, negotiated with them and only reached a settlement after midnight. It is heard that most of the Chinese police did not want to strike. According to Chinese police officers at the other three police stations, they were unaware of the strike at the London Road Police Station at 5 p.m. yesterday. At 6:30 p.m., some strikers went to various streets and used threats to force the police to board trucks and leave their posts. At 5 a.m. this morning, all the police officers happily resumed their duties due to the increase in their salaries, while the special British police and business groups returned home to rest after a night of hard work.

<h3 id="e8">On the Eve of the U.S. Election <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. election will be held the day after tomorrow. Whether President Roosevelt will be re-elected will be answered with certainty within the next few dozen hours. In today's world of turmoil, where the United States has become a pillar of strength, this is undoubtedly a major event of global interest.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Constitution, the election adopts a two-stage electoral system: first, voters in each state cast the first vote to elect 531 electors, which is equivalent to the total number of members of the Senate and House of Representatives; then, these electors cast the second vote to formally elect the next President and Vice President. The voting held on the 5th of this month is the first-stage vote, in which voters in each state vote for the electors they support. If the Democratic candidate receives a majority of votes in a particular state, then all of the electors to be elected by that state will go to the Democratic Party. For example, if Roosevelt receives more votes than other party candidates in New York the day after tomorrow's voting, then all 47 electors that New York is legally entitled to elect will be Democratic. Thus, Roosevelt can reliably obtain 47 votes from New York when the second-stage election is held. Therefore, although the voting the day after tomorrow is only the first-stage vote, the number of electors obtained by each party will be fully revealed at that time, and it will not be difficult to see who can be elected. Assuming that the Democratic Party can win more than half of the 531 seats in the first-stage election, i.e., more than 266 seats, then President Roosevelt's third consecutive term can be confirmed without waiting for the second-stage election.</p>
<p>When Roosevelt was first elected President in 1932, he won in 42 states in the first vote, thus winning a total of 472 votes, while the Republican candidate Hoover only received 59 votes. When Roosevelt was elected for re-election in 1936, he won in 46 states, winning a total of 523 votes, while the Republican candidate Landon only won five votes from Maine and three votes from Vermont. These were Roosevelt's unprecedented victories in the previous two elections. It is generally expected that Roosevelt may not receive such a large majority as in the previous two elections in this election, for three reasons: (1) A president serving three consecutive terms is unprecedented in American tradition. Not only has the opposition party used this as a target of attack, but there are also some dissenters within the Democratic Party. (2) The Republican candidate Wilkie nominated this year agrees with Roosevelt's policies on foreign policy and national defense policy. This strategy has clearly deprived the Democratic Party of a weapon to call upon. (3) On the domestic front, the Republican Party has strongly attacked the current government's "New Deal" movement and general economic policies, which has won the favor of capitalists and businessmen in general, and can also be used to attract anti-New Deal figures in the Democratic Party to shake the party's ranks. In fact, the Republican Party's gradual restoration of its past position in various states has been clearly demonstrated in the two recent congressional elections held in 1938 and this year, and it is to be expected that it will launch a more enthusiastic competition in the general election the day after tomorrow.</p>
<p>Originally, geographically speaking, the Democratic Party has an advantage in the southwest of the United States, while the Republican Party is more dominant in the six New England states in the east. The vote of the central states should be competed by both parties. In terms of class division, Roosevelt is supported by farmers and the lower classes, as well as liberal intellectuals, while Wilkie is backed by big capitalists and some business people who oppose the New Deal. The middle class are the ones who are being fought for by the two. According to the results of the survey released by the Public Opinion Survey Institute on the 14th of last month, Roosevelt can get 441 votes. According to the estimates made recently by Reuters reporters, Roosevelt can win in 34 states, accounting for 366 votes, while Wilkie can get the support of 14 states, accounting for about 165 votes. These estimates are certainly not reliable, but judging from the general trend, at this moment when the international situation is becoming increasingly serious and the threat to the United States is becoming more and more urgent, President Roosevelt, who is known for his brilliance, decisiveness and great talent, is undoubtedly the most appropriate person to deal with the overall situation in the future. Moreover, according to Roosevelt's words and deeds during his eight years in office, all prove that he has both knowledge and courage, and is a head of state who dares to act and knows how to protect the interests of the United States and how to promote justice and humanity. Since the defeat of France and the further collusion between Germany, Italy and Japan, he has not only made rapid achievements in national defense, such as (1) appointing Knox as Secretary of the Navy and Stimson as Secretary of the Army to actively promote national defense policies, (2) passing various military expansion procedures, (3) increasing the national military manufacturing capacity, especially the number of aircraft produced, (4) implementing the conscription law. He has also taken bold and decisive actions in foreign policy, such as (1) implementing joint defense between the United States and Canada, (2) concluding an agreement with Britain to exchange 50 destroyers for the lease of British territories in the Atlantic, (3) actively assisting China and promoting a clearer and stronger Far East policy to respond to Japan's intimidation. Because Roosevelt has already achieved so much, the Republican Party's various accusations against the current government in the election campaign are quite like "shooting at a target that is not there," because in general, except for Wilkie having other ambitions in domestic and economic policies, all his proposals in foreign and national defense, and Roosevelt's actual actions, are at most only differences in degree, and there is no fundamental difference; therefore, to take a step back, even if Wilkie wins the election, he will definitely follow the old ways in the policy of actively expanding the army and assisting China and Britain. The problem is that what Roosevelt has done in the past is a fact that is visible to the world, while what Wilkie is advocating is still a check that has not yet been cashed.</p>
<p>In summary, on the eve of this election, although we dare not assert that Roosevelt will definitely be elected, he undoubtedly has a considerable advantage (of course, unexpected results are not absolutely impossible in the U.S. election), because, as New York Governor La Guardia said: "The American people would rather trust Roosevelt's known mistakes than try Wilkie's unknown advantages," which seems to represent the opinion of most Americans.</p>

<p>Athens: Confirmed news: Greek troops wielding hand grenades and bayonets defeated Italian troops on the summit of Mount Pisanderi last night. The Italian army's attack on Florina has suffered a serious setback. Mount Pisanderi is a key point overlooking the highway from Gordes to Florina. The Greek mountain combat team occupied the summit after taking the offensive. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens: Greek elite infantry launched a fierce attack on Italian troops yesterday, shaking the heavens with their war cries. They captured a mountain peak 4,995 feet high. The Greek army's victory marks the first time they have extended into Albanian territory. The victory is recognized as being quite important as a sign of the Greek army fighting bravely, which is quite commendable. Having occupied this mountain, the Greek army can use long-range artillery to bombard Korcha, a key city on the Albanian border. The fierce Greek mountain combat team is currently holding key positions in the rugged countryside on the mountains along the highway to Florina, confronting the elite Alpini of the Italian army. The Italian army seems to have made little progress. According to a South Slav observer in Stani, a place near the junction of the three countries of South Slavs, Greece, and Albania, the Italian goal is to break through eastward through the Prespa mountain range in order to reach Florina (on the highway and railway from Monastir to Salonika), so as to peek into Larissa in the southwest and Korcea in the southeast. However, the Greek army has clearly defended the key position on the only mountain path, namely the Bigla Heights, which cannot be crossed by the Italian army's motorized units. There was heavy artillery fire near there yesterday, indicating that the Italian army has bombarded the key Greek positions on the flanks of Mount Bigla. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens: Greek troops defending the Albanian border, with the cover of a small number of Greek aircraft and the cannons of destroyers off the coast of Corfu, are resisting the Italian troops' advance on Yannina. A communiqué claims that the Italian army's very successful attack on Florina has been repulsed by the Greek army, forcing them to retreat with bloodshed. In addition, Greek sharpshooters attacked Italian troops attempting to strafe the Pissosfla mountain pass with machine guns and rifles, inflicting heavy casualties. This mountain pass is the gateway to the Florina railway center and is of great strategic importance, but the Italian army's all-day bombardment has failed to drive the Greek army from the pass. The communiqué acknowledges that two columns of Italian troops are advancing on Yannina in the northwest of the Epirus front. For the past two days, the Italian troops there have launched many attacks with infantry and tanks, but have been heavily bombed by Greek aircraft. News from the front line says that although the Greek army is fighting with a daring land and air tactic and a better-equipped fascist war machine in this area, most of the Greek army is gradually showing signs of fatigue. The continuous Italian air raids have caused strict blackout regulations to be implemented throughout northern Greece. (2nd International News Service dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to responsible military sources here, the Greek army in the Florina area seems to have advanced five kilometers along the highway from Florina to Bitolj in Albanian territory. It is also said that the Greek army in the southern Pindus area, which had previously retreated, now seems to have received reinforcements and repulsed the Italian army. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>South Slav Arite: News here yesterday claimed that Italian troops have concentrated a large number of motorized units in the Korça area for the past two days. Nine Italian ships carrying motorized units arrived in Durrës yesterday. These troops immediately went to Tirana, Albania. It is believed that they are heading to the Korça area.

<p>London: According to news from Greece, Italy has not yet launched its fierce offensive on Salonika. The Italian main offensive is currently in the coastal area. The attacking troops are using many light cannons. Roman newspapers say that Italian troops have crossed the Kalamas River north of Yannina, but dispatches from Athens say that Greek troops have counterattacked and retaken a mountain, capturing some enemy military supplies. Greek authorities also say that the Italian advance has not penetrated more than six miles. It is estimated that Greece has mobilized 400,000 troops and is confident that with the help of the winter weather, it can resist the better-equipped Italian army. Greek warships in the Ionian Sea heavily bombarded Italian troops advancing along the coastal road towards Yannina. Yannina is the main objective of the Italian army in Epirus. Italian troops and armored vehicles were shelled for an hour. No Italian warships or aircraft appeared. Also, according to news from Rome yesterday, Italy expects to capture Yannina today. The Soviet Red Army newspaper said that the British Navy has prevented Italian troops from landing on Crete and Corfu. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest: According to news from the Italian-Greek front, the Greek army is still strongly resisting in the Pissosfla mountain pass despite being heavily shelled by Italian artillery, and is unwilling to lose an inch of land. The Italian Pissosfla mountain pass is located in Mount Pigel and is a key point of Lolina. The Greek army has decided to defend this place to the death, and has repulsed several Italian attacks. At the same time, the Greek Air Force is attacking Korça, bombing the airfield and military facilities there. Greek aircraft, with a spirit of daring, are engaging in low-altitude attacks, strafing Italian troops heading to the Florina front with machine guns. The Italian army suffered heavy casualties. The attack by Greek aircraft threw the Italian army into chaos, and their advance was blocked, with most of their equipment destroyed. According to news from Florina, the Greek army's battle yesterday was blessed by heaven, because there was heavy snowfall on the Florina front yesterday, and the Pissosfla mountain pass was covered with thick snow, which obstructed the Italian army's advance. Also, Greek radio said that the Greek army on the Florina front yesterday was not only unwilling to lose an inch of land, but had actually repulsed the Italian army and occupied two mountain strongholds, inflicting heavy casualties on the Italian army. Also, news from Florina said that a fierce artillery battle between the Italian and Greek armies has been going on for three days. The Italian army has tried every means to break through the Pigunfoel mountain pass, but has been blocked by Greek artillery fire and unable to advance. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Authoritative sources announced today that British troops have landed on Greek islands to help them resist the Italian army, but the location of these islands was not disclosed. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens: British naval officers have recently arrived in Athens and several Greek islands to prepare for cooperation with Greece as soon as possible. The Greek people are very excited to see this evidence of British aid. The term "Fifth Column" first appeared in newspaper headlines yesterday. All newspapers carried articles urging Greeks to be vigilant against enemy friends spreading propaganda and confusing public opinion in Athens and other places. It is heard that Italy has asked Hungary to take care of Italian interests in Greece. Well-informed sources claim that Germany has asked Spain if it can take on the obligation of taking care of German interests in Greece when the development of the situation affects Germany. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Athens: Official sources here are very puzzled by the Italian army's method of operation, because although they have an immediate advantage in terms of air force, they only attacked the main lines of the Greek army five days after the start of the war. It is generally believed that the appearance of British army and naval officers on the streets and in hotels is a sign that actual assistance will be announced in the next twelve hours.

<p>Athens  Yesterday, Italy accelerated its air war against Greece, sending planes to attack areas near Athens, Salonika, Corfu, and Larissa. Greek Prime Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Armed Forces, Metaxas, said to the cabinet, "We must prepare to endure suffering from the land and from the sky," which has now been verified. Athens issued its first air raid alert, but no bombs fell on the city. Salonika was attacked by three waves of Italian planes, resulting in 400 civilian deaths and 80 injuries, with 22 fires breaking out. In Corfu, five people were killed and 26 injured. Most of the casualties were in a town center, far from military targets, in a public square. Larissa, an important transportation hub, was heavily bombed by nine Italian planes yesterday afternoon, with 32 bombs dropped, resulting in the deaths of four soldiers and one civilian, and injuries to two soldiers and one police officer. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Rome  This afternoon's Italian military report stated that our forces are active in the Kalamas River area of Greece, continuing to advance towards Yannina and the Pindus Mountains. Yesterday, our air force bombed an arsenal in Salamis, and military targets on Corfu and ships docked there were also bombed, with multiple hits and fires breaking out. Barracks in Skippuro, the Larissa train station, the Corinth Canal, and the Corinth-Athens railway line were also bombed. Yesterday, our planes went twice to attack Salonika, engaging in aerial combat with enemy planes, shooting down one enemy fighter. All our planes returned safely to their bases. Two of our naval reconnaissance planes engaged three enemy planes in aerial combat in the central Mediterranean, shooting down two enemy planes while losing one of our own. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>London  According to the Greek government, Italian air raids have resulted in approximately 300 civilian deaths and injuries. Salonika was attacked four times, resulting in 59 deaths and 84 injuries. Military targets were not damaged. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Athens  Last night, the Greek official gazette stated that Greek forces, overcoming strong resistance, have advanced three miles into Albanian territory, capturing several positions with bayonet charges, capturing nine Italian officers, 153 soldiers, and 100 warhorses. Italian planes bombed 15 cities and towns, killing 90 soldiers and civilians and injuring 209. Italian air raids focused on civilians, with a hospital and a school among the destroyed buildings. Greek planes conducted reconnaissance flights and low-level bombing of the Corri Crete Chai airfield and mechanized units concentrated on the Iporus front line. All Greek planes returned safely to base. One Italian fighter plane was shot down, and the pilot was captured. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>Ankara  The Turkish Parliament opened yesterday. President Ismet, in his address, stated that when the previous Parliament opened, he had clarified Turkish policy, which remains unchanged. Turkey will maintain its non-interference in the war. Turkey will maintain normal relations with all countries that show the same goodwill towards Turkey, which should not be hindered by the attitude of non-interference in the war. This attitude absolutely makes it impossible for belligerent countries to use Turkish territory, territorial waters, and airspace. Turkey will continue to make this impossible while not participating in the war. The foundation of Turkish policy is to maintain its political independence and territorial integrity, without harboring ambitions to act according to the development of events. Turkey does not covet an inch of other countries' land, nor does it want to infringe upon the rights of others. Therefore, foreign countries have no reason to consider this policy offensive or to criticize Turkey's efforts to protect its rights. Greece is Turkey's neighbor, regarded as a friendly nation, and its territory is suitably located in a security zone that is of great importance to Turkey. Now, unfortunately, it has been drawn into the war. Turkey is currently carefully studying this situation with its ally, Britain. He hopes that the policy principles he has previously stated, which keep Turkey out of the war, can continue to maintain Turkey's future security. After the defeat of France, the attack on Britain met with stubborn resistance, and the war situation has entered a new stage. This stage may last for quite some time, and human suffering will be prolonged. It is impossible not to feel pain when witnessing the decline of civilization and the darkness of the future. At this time, Turkey must not only pay attention to all developments that may harm its important interests, but also continue to faithfully adhere to its friendship and alliance. Now that Britain is in a difficult situation, carrying out its magnificent struggle for survival, it is Turkey's responsibility to declare that the alliance linking Britain and Turkey remains strong and unshakable. The friendly relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union are a factor of fundamental value in a changing world. Both countries wish to make this factor eternal, not to be influenced by any other forces. This policy has been effective in the past and will continue to protect the interests of both countries without harming others, he said. The Turkish President mentioned the strengthening of the Turkish army and the spirit of sacrifice of the Turkish people, saying that Turkish honor will certainly fulfill its duties. The unity of the Turkish people is stronger than before, and they are determined to meet any call with their spirit of self-sacrifice when necessary. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Athens  Diplomatic circles are very satisfied with the firm attitude expressed yesterday by Turkish President Ismet, which clearly warned Bulgaria not to get involved in the vortex. It is expected that the Soviet Union may not take action, but it is believed that it will agree with Turkey's position. Although enemy propaganda in Yugoslavia is very strong at present, the general public believes that it will remain neutral. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>Istanbul  Well-informed sources here believe that if Bulgaria enters the war on the side of the Axis powers, Turkey will not be able to remain aloof.

According to a document issued by the Yugoslav government yesterday, Yugoslavia had long adopted a policy of friendship with its neighbors, including Germany and Italy, before the outbreak of the war. When war broke out between the major powers, Yugoslavia immediately declared its strict neutrality, relying solely on the respect of other countries for Yugoslavia's independence, security, and borders. This policy has been understood openly and thoroughly by Berlin and Rome more than once. Yugoslavia deeply regrets the outbreak of war between Italy and Greece, as both countries have friendly relations with Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia has stated its intention to maintain its original attitude and hopes that its interests will not be threatened by any future developments. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>Washington  The U.S. presidential election has reached its final stage. President Roosevelt and his Republican opponent, Willkie, are focusing their efforts on three decisive areas in New Jersey, where whoever wins the most votes can be elected president. However, according to unofficial predictions, the final competition will be in Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, and the upper Mississippi River basin. Political observers believe that President Roosevelt gained the lead in mid-summer, but Willkie's 18,000-mile campaign has been slightly less successful. (United Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington  With only four days left until the presidential election, reports from Chicago indicate that Republican presidential candidate Willkie's momentum in the Midwest has encountered setbacks, while President Roosevelt's strength is increasing. Roosevelt was quite cheerful when he received reporters yesterday, seemingly fully confident in the election. A week ago, only 7,000 people in Chicago listened to Interior Secretary Ickes' speech, while 30,000 people went to the square to listen to New York Mayor LaGuardia's speech in support of Roosevelt. It is generally believed that the Republican Party's setback in the Midwest is due to Willkie's connection with labor leader Lewis, which is generally referred to as "another unholy alliance." However, the decisive battle for victory will be in New York, where Willkie's momentum is said to have improved slightly. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>Washington  Hull said in a broadcast speech last night that the United States is now in danger. The Axis powers are attempting to control the seas to achieve their desire to conquer other continents. The American people are thinking about maintaining the country's security and peace, and it is necessary to be prepared for danger and take precautions early to be effective. Although there are rumors outside that Roosevelt is preparing for war, his words are baseless and untrustworthy. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>New York  American newspapers have devoted significant space to publishing the speeches and actions of presidential candidates. Willkie still said that if Roosevelt is re-elected president, the United States will inevitably fall into war, while Roosevelt firmly denied Willkie's statement. It is still difficult to predict who has the advantage. (Haitong News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>Geda States Italy's Attitude</p>
<p>Rome  Geda, the editor of the Italian newspaper Giornale d'Italia, published an article in the newspaper yesterday, stating that the Axis countries are not concerned about Roosevelt's election for a third term. If Roosevelt is indeed re-elected, thereby allowing the United States to participate in the war in some form, the result will only complicate the United States' diplomatic situation further, without affecting the situation in Europe. Geda pointed out that Roosevelt and other responsible American politicians have spared no effort in attacking the Axis countries for several years. From Roosevelt's Chicago speech in 1937 to Secretary of State Hull's speech on July 21, 1940, none of them failed to denigrate dictatorial politics, targeting the Axis countries, while also engaging in extensive military preparations, such as increasing the navy by 20 percent. In addition, the U.S. president's policy also wants to control the European war, such as prohibiting gasoline exports to Italy, prohibiting Germans and Italians from taking Clipper planes across the Atlantic, and funding the UK with 50 destroyers. In short, although the United States wants to control the European war, in fact, it has no real impact, only making its own people feel the danger of the policy. Finally, Geda tried his best to refute the rumor that Germany and Italy were spying on South America, calling it a propaganda trick. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>Japan Does Not Criticize U.S. Election</p>
<p>Tokyo  Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka announced today that he does not understand why the U.S. government must advise overseas Chinese in the Far East to evacuate. The Foreign Minister believes that the situation in the Far East has not changed since the signing of the Tripartite Pact, and "I really cannot say why" for the U.S. evacuation. He also stated that he has no freedom to criticize the U.S. presidential election. Regarding this point, the Information Bureau specially published the Foreign Minister's speech as follows: "Who will be elected as the next U.S. president has nothing to do with us. Therefore, this fact is not a suitable topic for me to discuss. As for the U.S. evacuation, it is related to me. Since I do not know the reason, there is no need to speculate. Although, I have said it in great detail, that is, the U.S. government is taking this step, and I cannot know why it must come from this. Because since the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact, no matter what, the situation here has never changed. And the nature of this pact, I have also repeatedly explained." (United Press, 2nd)</p>

<p>Washington  Well-informed Japanese sources here believe that there may be a delay in the appointment of a new Japanese ambassador to the United States. It is said that Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka is currently finding it very difficult to find a competent and willing successor. According to reliable criticisms here, many prominent Japanese diplomatic figures have been consulted about whether they would be willing to take the post of ambassador to the United States, but they all believe that under the current circumstances, the post is extremely difficult to please and are unwilling to accept it. It is believed here that even if no one temporarily takes over Horiuchi's post, the U.S. authorities should not immediately regard it as a sign of Japan's dissatisfaction with U.S. policy, but only as a result of the recent tension in relations between the two countries, which makes the post unpleasant. The United Press recently learned from reliable Japanese sources here that Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka had appointed the former president of the South Manchuria Railway to the post of ambassador, but he had refused.

<p>Washington  Although the United States' national attention is currently focused on the exciting and tense presidential election battle, all parties are still paying attention to Europe and the Far East, and are generally satisfied with the Japanese troops' forced withdrawal from Guangxi and Yichang. What kind of trend the Japanese troops' retreat foreshadows is still unknown. Some Far Eastern people believe that this is the first sign that Japan is beginning to feel a major impact after three years of war with China. People here tolerate the Tokyo newspapers' clamor that the United States is preparing to attack Japan. The United States is currently transporting military supplies to the Philippine Islands, but there is no official announcement. However, those in the know believe it is possible. Some of the planes originally intended to be transported to Thailand were indeed blocked in Manila and diverted to U.S. military use. These are all actions taken by the United States with the determination to prepare to prevent attacks, such as advising U.S. expatriates to return home. Although the United States does not want to cause war, it is determined to prepare to deal with any unexpected actions from a country. This country, whose cabinet members have previously clearly stated that if the United States does not like the "New Order in East Asia," then it must fight a war. In other words, according to observers familiar with the situation in the Far East, since Japan has joined the anti-American alliance, the threatened United States is bound to take preparatory steps to deal with these threats. Japan cannot be blamed for this. The U.S. State Department has absolutely no signs of anxiety and ordering U.S. expatriates to return home. As for the news from Tokyo that the return of U.S. expatriates within China and Japan indicates a more serious situation than the ambassador's protest, people here do not pay much attention to it. However, it is believed that Japan now understands that it has created a serious situation in the past few years, which may not be a bad thing. Officials here expressed in private conversations that the U.S. evacuation of expatriates is in line with China's policy of being threatened by Japan and preparing with guns. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

When the 120 newly arrived officers, women, and children attended a welcome party at the Army and Marine Corps Club, the wives of Navy officers publicly expressed that it was unfair to force these people to leave their husbands. General Willard also stated that the Army Department may increase manpower on the Philippine Islands. (United Press, 2nd)</p>

<p>New York  The annual meeting of "One Bowl of Rice" held at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel (one of New York's most prestigious hotels) last night was a great success. Among the guests who participated were countless prominent New York figures. Chinese Ambassador Dr. Hu Shih was the main speaker. His speech included, "We are here to celebrate the achievements of the past year." Hu Shih praised Americans for their sympathy for China, saying that historians often explain history with economic factors, but no one has included the factor of "sympathy." Financial assistance can be stopped by national law, but sympathy and its associated assistance cannot be prevented by law. Therefore, when a country is at war, whether it receives the sympathy or curse of the entire civilized world, the difference cannot be measured by distance, he said. Ambassador Hu continued, "The Chinese people fighting to the death have trapped the world's most terrifying aggressor in a quagmire, unable to assist its partners in Europe in their plot to plunder the interests of others. China must continue its permanent resistance and will not stop. It is impossible to seek peace in the Far East today, because such peace cannot avoid being a second Munich, and even worse than Munich." Famous writer Lin Yutang then spoke, saying that the decline of Japan's invasion of China is now beginning to show its end, and the result of the war against China is even more tragic than Napoleon's invasion of Russia. The Japanese government is in an extremely difficult situation in diplomacy, even though it is making intimidating noises. It is a good thing that the American people are donating medicines to China, but they should also send headache powder to Konoe and his partners. Lin also said that Japan will not admit defeat in China and will definitely have other violent attempts, which will result in Japan's decline. (United Press, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Britain and Italy Will Have Major Naval Battle in the Mediterranean Sea, Britain Will Use Greek Ports as Bases, and Will Take Offensive Against Italy When the Time Is Ripe <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>London  According to the opinions of naval figures in London, Italy's declaration of war on Greece has given the British Navy in the Mediterranean a great opportunity. Soon, it can enter a large-scale offensive stage from the current stage of activity, and inflict a powerful blow on Italy. Britain's power in the Mediterranean is now rapidly strengthening, and the military value of the Mediterranean is now greater than before. Since Greece joined the war, Britain can choose Greek ports that are closer to Italian bases and utilize them. However, these ports must have equipment to defend against submarine and aircraft attacks, which will cost some money and time. There are many military strongholds on the Greek islands and mainland that are of great help to naval warfare. Although it is a matter of tactics, it is not appropriate to say more at present, but it may be helpful to give an example to clarify it. If we want to maintain traffic to the Aegean Sea, then Crete is a very important place. Many islands in the Aegean Sea are also places where Britain can fuel light warships, and the Ionian Islands have the same military value. The British Navy should be active when the time is ripe, but at the same time, it should also try to curb the development of the Italian army's left wing in Libya. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<p>Cairo, According to an aviation ministry communiqué just released, the British Air Force is now extremely active in the Near East. Among the targets bombed by British aircraft are Italian airfields and transportation hubs. In air raids, British aircraft have defeated large formations of Italian aircraft, shooting down several. On October 31st, a large number of enemy S-79 bombers, escorted by twelve CR-42 fighters, attempted to attack targets in the Matruh area. The British Air Force immediately scrambled to intercept, shooting down four Italian aircraft and destroying four CR-42s. In addition, four more enemy aircraft were severely damaged and likely unable to return to base. Two British fighters collided in aerial combat, but both pilots safely parachuted to land. One British fighter was shot down by the enemy, and another engaged three Italian aircraft but has not yet returned to base. The British Air Force also raided Gambut in Libya, destroying two Italian aircraft on the ground and severely damaging several more. The Minaasa airfield in Libya was also bombed, destroying a building and an aircraft. Multiple motor transport vehicles were also hit by bombs. Tobruk was attacked on October 31st, but the extent of damage could not be determined due to poor weather and visibility. British aircraft also conducted extensive reconnaissance over Libya. Qirqa, north of Lake Tana, was attacked twice by British aircraft, causing considerable damage to a large concentration of enemy transport vehicles there. Enemy aircraft dropped several bombs on Polin Island, causing slight damage. Four enemy stations between Djibouti and Dire Dawa were bombed by British aircraft, destroying many buildings and railway tracks. With the exception of the aerial combat near Matruh, all British aircraft returned safely from the other raids. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London, On Friday afternoon, a British ship in the Dover Strait was heavily shelled for an hour and fifteen minutes by German guns on the French coast. More than one hundred shells were fired, but the British ship appeared to be unharmed. The German guns were in three batteries, each firing six guns in rotation, continuously shelling. The shells exploded around the British ship, but the British ship continued to speed westward through the strait. The German gun positions were located (1) at the lighthouse near Calais, (2) east of the patrol monument near Calais, and (3) midway between the two locations mentioned above. Visibility was exceptionally clear at the time. Many spectators watched the battle from the cliffs along the coast of Kent, seeing the flashes of gunfire, the fierce barrage of shells, and the seawater splashing up like columns, shaking the coast of the strait.

<p>London, Italian fighters participated in yesterday's air raid on Britain, disregarding the heavy fire from British anti-aircraft guns. Several small, short-winged biplanes were spotted in the skies off the southeast coast yesterday afternoon, but they were driven out to sea by anti-aircraft batteries. Two aircraft flew over a coastal city at an altitude of approximately 10,000 feet. Anti-aircraft shells exploded near the two aircraft, which then hurriedly fled across the strait. Several ships in the Dover Strait, three miles offshore, were attacked by thirteen dive bombers. The enemy planes descended rapidly from the clear sky, circled over the ships, dropped three bombs each, and then climbed again to make a second attack. However, due to heavy anti-aircraft fire, they later flew towards the French coast. German long-range artillery also fired several shells at the British ships. Soon after, a squadron of Spitfire British planes flew in to patrol the strait. The two British ships continued to move forward. The German long-range artillery continued to fire until dusk. Yesterday, the enemy lost eight planes, and the British lost six fighters, but the pilots of two planes are safe. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London, The Air Ministry announced that the British Royal Air Force attacked Naples (a major Italian city) three times on Thursday night.

Heavy bombs were concentrated on the oil refineries and gasoline depots in the south of the city. The sound of the bombing was like thunder, and the fire lit up the sky, proving the effectiveness of the bombing. In the second wave, British planes flew as low as 2,000 feet to attack railway stations and key railway points. The third wave bombed anti-aircraft batteries until they could no longer retaliate. The weather varied along the route last night, but the city of Naples was quite clear. (2nd United Press dispatch)</p>

The first batch will consist of 500 men and will be stationed at Fort Benning, Georgia. The U.S. decision to take this step is based on the success of the German army in using this type of unit. The Army believes that since the Germans have been so successful with parachute troops, any army, such as the U.S. Army, must have such a weapon. Although Stimson called the parachute troops a "sacrifice squad," he did not mention extra pay for their work. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>

When asked about the report that the Pandley Rotator Company was secretly manufacturing bomber sights for Britain, which would be shipped to Britain, the President replied that the report was not correct. He knew nothing about it. If the report was like other rumors, it was probably not correct. (2nd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington, According to military sources here today, the U.S. Army Air Corps will receive detailed specifications for British secret aircraft turrets as a reward for the U.S. granting bombing sights to Britain, but the War Department refused to disclose any information about the matter. Its spokesman said, "This negotiation involves U.S. military policy, which prohibits public discussion at this time." Military sources here told reporters when revealing the agreement between the British and American governments that these secret turrets were recently installed on British fighters and interceptors. It is believed that the turret has a 360-degree range of rotation and can fire rapidly at any point on the compass. The turret is powered by the aircraft engine. According to military intelligence, the recent defeats of German bombers by British aircraft are due to the fact that British aircraft have this turret. (2nd International News Service dispatch)</p>

<p>Moscow, The "World Politics and Economics Magazine" published a long article discussing the living conditions of the Japanese laboring class during the war. The article stated that the Japanese laboring class has been bearing an extraordinary war burden since 1931, and the wars of the past three years have been the greatest difficulty for the Japanese people. The cost of operations in China has reached 16.5 billion yen, exceeding ten times the cost of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904, which is the largest war expenditure in Japanese history. It has become common for the Japanese laboring class to work 16 or 18 hours a day, with no days off. The length of their working hours is unprecedented in any country in the world. The article also discussed the serious problems caused by the lack of labor in Japanese industry. It is said that female employees in various restaurants, cafes, dance halls, and other places have been selected by the Japanese authorities to serve as female workers. The only results of Japan's three years of aggression in China have been the most cruel exploitation of labor, a decline in production, and the bankruptcy of thousands of small businesses.

<p>I was at Brooklands, near Versailles, and took a British plane, landing at Hendon Aerodrome. I immediately went to see the French liaison officer, who led me to British Intelligence. The authorities there were just entertaining newspaper reporters, and I arrived at a very opportune moment. The chairman, Foreign Ministry representative, Mr. Pick, immediately pushed me onto the platform, saying, "Your mission is to announce the situation in France, and now is an excellent opportunity. All the national press of England are here, please announce it to your heart's content."</p>
<p>I did not know how to phrase it well, having had no prior preparation. Even in normal times, my English isn't eloquent. But on that day, because of the misfortune that France had encountered, and because of the terrible future that was imminent, I was deeply moved, and my words flowed endlessly. After my speech, all three hundred newspaper reporters in attendance stood up and applauded continuously, which greatly surprised me. I didn't believe that anyone before had told them so frankly about the dire situation in France, and explained how urgent British assistance was, and that without British help, France would not be able to hold on.</p>
<p>Soon after, I was led by Mr. Nicolson, the Under-Secretary of British Intelligence, and Mr. Pick, to meet the Minister of Intelligence, Mr. Duff Cooper. I repeated what I had just said to the British public over the radio. That very night, the BBC allowed me to use the "best time," which was at 9:15 PM during the "Supplementary Report" slot.</p>
<p>I hastily wrote a draft, the last paragraph of which was as follows:</p>
<p>"Our French friends, if you want to help us, not in 1941, not this autumn, and not even next month, only 'now.' We are well aware of the glorious achievements of the British Army and Air Force, they have done their best. What is impossible for them, this is the time. We have complete trust in our British allies. We know that they will pour out all their resources to engage in the war. All we ask of them is to understand the importance of 'time.' Please rekindle the so-called 'Dunkirk Spirit'! Before the Dunkirk evacuation, it was generally believed that no more than 30,000 people could be evacuated from the half-ruined harbor within a few days, and even the most optimistic people thought that at most it would be no more than 50,000. But in fact, as many as 335,000 people were rescued. How was it done? Who understands it better than you who were there? If you show the Dunkirk Spirit again, you will win this battle and win this war. In Dunkirk, you mobilized every boat. Now, please mobilize every plane, every soldier, and every gun. Let us together ask the United States, which is very willing to help us, to speed up the completion of items that would normally take years to manufacture within a month. Experts will unanimously say that it is impossible to train, equip, and dispatch a large army in just a few weeks. This is true, but no matter what, the impossible must be done, and it can be done..."</p>
<p>The BBC asked me to repeat the broadcast in French to Canada at 2:00 AM, and again to British schools the next day. I did not sleep for two days and was exhausted, but I was extremely pleased to learn that the British public responded quickly to my request. In the days that followed, I received countless letters and met with a large number of visitors, all with the same wish: "We are willing to help France. How can we help?"</p>
<p>I knew that British public opinion wanted the government to take stronger measures; but good intentions cannot replace planes and tanks.</p>
<p>I said to my friends, "These letters and condolences are inspiring. But what can you actually give us?"</p>
<p>Our faces immediately showed serious embarrassment.</p>
<p>They replied, "Except for a Canadian division that has just departed from England, we have no troops to fight on the continent. We suffered too heavily in the Flanders campaign and have not been able to replenish. We will send several squadrons of planes to France to help, but one thing we cannot ignore is that our aircraft factories and ports must be properly protected. As long as you can hold on until 1941..."</p>
<p>I knew that this game was lost! I knew that France had no hope.</p>
<p>I met with the French Ambassador to England, Mr. Corbin, who remained courageous throughout this difficult period. I said to him, "The war has lasted for ten months, and England has no troops to send, isn't that strange?"</p>
<p>He replied, "True, but we must be fair. They have indeed kept their alliance commitments. The formation of British divisions was clearly stipulated in the agreement with deadlines, and they did not miss them. The mistake was that when we signed the alliance, we did not ask England to send more divisions than in 1914, but it is a fact that we did not ask. Our defenses and defensive capabilities were exaggerated like myths, blinding the eyes and ears of our staff and ministers."</p>
<p>On the morning of the 13th, the newspaper reported that the German army was approaching Paris. As I was anxiously reading The Times, the phone suddenly rang, and a maid informed me that the Queen would receive me at Buckingham Palace at 11:00 AM. Queen Elizabeth, when she was still the Duchess of York, had met me once. Later, when she visited Paris as Queen, my father had met her once, but I didn't know what the purpose of this summons was. The palace guards were all tall and wearing red uniforms. The palace was full of commemorative photographs and bamboo furniture, still showing the scene of the Victorian era.</p>

<h3 id="e46">National Cheng Chung University Holds Opening Ceremony, President Chiang and Minister Chen Both Deliver Admonitory Speeches <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>(Taihe, 1st dispatch) National Cheng Chung University held its opening ceremony on the birthday of President Chiang (October 31st), and yesterday was designated as the founding anniversary. President Chiang and Minister Chen Lifu both delivered admonitory speeches. President Chiang's admonitory speech briefly stated that students who come here to study must understand the meaning and unique mission of the establishment of this university. What this university wants to create is not only talented people who are well-versed in academics, but also cadres for revolutionary nation-building. The ancients said, "Teachers are those who transmit the Way, impart knowledge, and resolve doubts." Therefore, the Way that this university researches and teaches must be the great Way of the Three Principles of the People for saving the nation and the world. The courses taught to students must be practical knowledge and skills for undertaking basic tasks of revolutionary nation-building. And what resolves confusion and shows students the way of learning and being a person is to make students understand the meaning of life, the purpose of living, and the responsibilities of modern citizens. The task of this university, on the one hand, should be to study the history and progress of the Chinese National Revolution and to expound the true meaning of the Three Principles of the People, in order to show us the direction of our struggle. On the other hand, we must, based on the principle of ascending from the low and traveling from the near, impart to students the knowledge necessary for practical work in response to the actual needs of the country and society, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education Reports on the General Situation of Secondary Education in Shanghai under Provincial Jurisdiction (Part 2) <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(2) General Situation in the 28th Year of the Republic (omitted) (3) Economic Pressure: Prices continue to rise, even increasing five or six times. Rent, water, and electricity have all increased significantly, while income remains the same. All necessary expenses cannot be reduced or exempted. Therefore, those who run education are facing increasing difficulties. In addition to the substantial reduction in office expenses, salaries have also been reduced considerably, even to the point of paying for only eleven or ten months of the year. In this environment, the spirit of struggling hard is certainly commendable, but the long-term pressure on the livelihoods of teachers and staff is a major problem.</p>
<p>(4) Current Difficulties</p>
<p>1. Economic Crisis: On the school side, in addition to the increasingly heavy economic pressure, the supplementary funds received are all included in the budget. Currently, housing funds, salaries, and wages all require funds, which cannot be met. This is the biggest difficulty at present. Efforts should be made to urge the payment of supplementary funds and remit them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>2. Difficulties in Moral Education: Shanghai is not an environment conducive to studying. After the resumption of classes in various schools, (1) due to the political environment, various forms of spiritual training cannot be implemented; (2) due to the limited school buildings, most students cannot live on campus; (3) due to the social environment, it is difficult to eliminate all temptations.</p>
<p>3. Difficulties in Teaching: (1) Reference and experimental tools such as books and instruments are almost zero; (2) all schools lack playgrounds, and physical education cannot be implemented; (3) in the concessions, many teaching materials are inconvenient to teach; (4) due to economic reasons, many teachers teach part-time, which affects teaching efficiency.</p>
<p>(5) Future Predictions</p>
<p>(1) If the cost of living continues to rise rapidly and without limitation, the economic difficulties may become increasingly serious. (2) If the changes in the concession environment further deteriorate, unexpected impacts may increase.</p>
<p>(6) Conclusion</p>
<p>(1) The minimum necessary funding under the current situation must be raised and disbursed on time. A. Supplementary funds from the Ministry must be increased and remitted on time. B. Provincial schools should be coordinated and adjusted by provincial funds. For example, schools where the Ministry's funds are insufficient and schools that only pay ten or eleven months' salaries should be adjusted appropriately. C. Private schools should be given appropriate subsidies, as their sources of funding are even fewer. (2) It is necessary to provide loans for teachers, staff, and students who are poor. (3) Omitted. (4) Improve student standards. A. Unified enrollment. B. Regular spot checks and graduation spot checks. (5) Strengthen moral education. A. Recommended reading materials. B. Encourage further study. C. Students with poor conduct will not be allowed to graduate. (6) Guidance on further education and employment, divided into guidance, assistance, and introduction. (End)</p>

<p>The securities black market was particularly turbulent yesterday, with the four types of B, C, D, and E all breaking the highest record of October 28th and reaching new highs. In the current environment, government bonds cannot be viewed with the usual perspective. Since the reorganization of gold, transactions have sharply decreased. As for foreign stocks, it is feared that they may be exploited by foreigners at this time, and precautions have been greatly increased. Government bonds are suitable for trading procedures at this time, and the transfer of remittances has been changed to a transfer of accounts, making it easier for merchants and most customers to engage in transactions. In addition, the war is going very smoothly, so there are many people collecting spot goods for storage. Transactions have expanded, and the market still feels a shortage of spot goods. More and more parties have flipped from short to long. However, there are still many speculators going short. According to this trend, even if there is a slight pullback, it will be easy to rise again. There are predictions that Class C will reach 63 yuan. Let's wait and see. Yesterday morning, trading was not very active. Class C opened at 61 yuan. Later, Renchang, Changkang, Xinchang, Yichang, and Lianyi all had sell orders, so Tianxing, Shunchang, Hengfu, and Lianhe, although they bought in, could not resist the selling pressure. The noon close was flat, with highs and lows. The afternoon news was even better. First, Hengfu bought in, and then Tongkang absorbed the market price, and the price immediately broke through the 61 yuan mark. Then, Tongs hun and Yuxing searched for and discovered a new record of 61 yuan and 4 jiao. Other companies such as Xinfu, Lianyi, and Yongda also had considerable needs. Hu Heji, Xinchang, Hongda, and Yichang all sold, but demand still seemed to exceed supply. Yuji only dealt in Class A and B, so the rise was slightly weaker. The result was a uniform increase of 2 to 8 jiao. The volume of transactions was 3.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Dasheng Third Factory were traded at 31.5 yuan per share.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Friday) dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat, with no changes in prices.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Finance, Foreign Exchange Buying Interest Rises Again <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, the HSBC listing, had no ups and downs. The black market for British and American exchange rates showed an uncertain trend, with fluctuating tightness, making it difficult to grasp. First, Chinese speculators sold, creating a strong situation. Then, because other speculators and Hong Kong Electric, etc., made profits, they came to settle their accounts, reaching 400,000 U.S. dollars. Although the American bank supplied without reluctance, it still felt insufficient, so the price returned to a flat level. Then, buying interest rose, and it turned soft again. As a result, at closing, British gold was at 3 pence 93875, and the U.S. exchange rate was 6 yuan 09375, a decrease of 03125 compared to yesterday. In terms of futures and forwards, there was still a slight gap. The trend was similar to the spot market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Electric Enters U.S. Exchange Market with Hundreds of Thousands</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London exchange rate was stable in the near term, and the forward rate fell by 0.0625. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London raw gold remained stable. The exchange rate between the British and U.S. dollars was unchanged, and the exchange rate against Shanghai was also flat. The U.S. dollar rose by 1 jiao against Shanghai and had no market against the French franc. The central listing of various exchange rates remained the same. The banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 953125 and the U.S. exchange rate at 6 yuan 125, both flat compared to the previous day's close. After the opening, Chinese speculators were the first to sell. Although the Chinese banks absorbed them, the market situation had hardened. It is estimated that the Chinese banks' selling price for the November U.S. exchange rate was 6 yuan 15625. Later, the American bank also intended to supply, and some Chinese businessmen had an appetite to buy. The initial transaction price for the current month's U.S. exchange rate was still 6 yuan 15625. Before long, Hong Kong Electric entered the market to settle its purchases, amounting to hundreds of thousands, so the underlying trend turned softer. The U.S. exchange rate in the same month was purchased by Hong Kong Electric from the American bank at 6 yuan 125. The HSBC listing was announced unchanged, and the silver balance tax was also announced without any increases or decreases. After that, Chinese banks, the East Asia Bank, and Hong Kong Electric absorbed the current month's shilling, and it is estimated that Youli and others sold it at 3 pence 9375. Until noon, foreign companies suddenly needed funds, and Chinese merchants continued to buy, so the price was tight. The U.S. exchange rate for the current month was offered by the American bank to foreign companies, etc., at 6 yuan 09375 and 125. As a result, at closing, the spot British gold was 3 pence 921875, and the U.S. exchange rate was 6 yuan 09375. The British gold was 3 pence 90625, and the U.S. exchange rate was 6 yuan 0625 for the same price. The U.S. exchange rate for the next month was tight, a difference of 03125 compared to the British and American exchange rates in the previous month. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British Flat, U.S. Dollar Fluctuating</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 2nd (Saturday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The current and future rates for the British exchange were unchanged, and the spot rate for the Japanese exchange was also unchanged.

At 11:30 AM, it was announced that all exchange rates were unchanged. At 11:35 AM, the spot rate for the Shanghai exchange rose by 3 yuan to 380 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Flat, Consistently Lengthening</p>
<p>Tianjin, 2nd (Saturday) dispatch: The exchange market opened loose this morning. The London telegraphic transfer rate was hard at 0.03125, at 3 pence 90625. The New York telegraphic transfer rate was long at 0.09375, at 6 yuan 09375. The Shanghai exchange fell by 5 jiao, to 100 yuan flat. The black market for "Joint Notes" was high at 1 yuan, at 82 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Foreign Currencies Mostly Stable <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw slight fluctuations. The spot price of silver dollars saw a slight increase, with British and American gold pounds also rising by five jiao. Trading in British gold notes remained sluggish, and market prices remained stagnant. The price of American gold notes initially fell to $15.59, but then gradually rose, reaching a high of $15.75 on the black market, an increase of five jiao compared to the previous day. The supply and demand for Hong Kong notes were balanced, and market prices were generally stable. There were no significant changes in Japanese and Korean gold notes, with the former remaining at $1.54 and the latter at $1.22.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Discount Rate as Low as $3 - Still as High as $4.50 <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bills of exchange first decreased and then suddenly increased. The discount rate per thousand yuan once dropped to only three yuan for inward bills and four yuan for outward bills. However, it soon rose to five and a half yuan for inward bills and four and a half yuan for outward bills, an increase of half a yuan compared to the previous day. The Shanghai Money Dealers Association's overnight interest rate was set at seven fen for both the morning and afternoon sessions, which is said to be one fen lower.</p>
<h3 id="e62">New Changed Check Clearing Time <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>

<h3 id="e63">Many Retail Investors are Short Sellers - Gold Price Increase Somewhat Stabilized - Spot and Futures Prices Converge at Around Twenty Yuan Higher <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's silver dollar gold market saw more gains in the black market, but the upward momentum was still relatively weak. Foreign exchange was tightening. One gold dealer even increased their long position by 1,700 to 1,800 taels, but people remained calm. Most retail investors were short sellers, with no one pushing prices up. Therefore, the price rose and then fell back, with the final increase being only 20 yuan. The morning opening was slightly lower at 5,440 yuan. Retail investors sold off, and the price once fell to 5,430 yuan. Gold dealers actively bought, and the buying momentum was once strong, reaching 5,485 yuan. Soon, hidden retail short sellers became active again, causing a reversal, and the final price was 5,465 yuan. Over 3,000 taels were traded in half a day. Cash transactions were rare, and prices converged, with spot prices being over 20 yuan higher than futures prices. Jewelry gold rose by 10 yuan to 570 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained stable.</p>
<p>Silver Dollars Rise Twenty Yuan</p>
<p>The market opened with stable prices in the early morning due to the quiet foreign exchange market and purchases by money exchangers, thus avoiding a sharp decline. Gold dealers bought ten taels from silver firms at 5,440 yuan. Soon, silver firms conducted a transaction of twenty taels, slightly lowering the price to 5,430 yuan. At this time, gold and silver firms took advantage of the low prices to buy in, absorbing some supply, and the price rose by 40 to 50 yuan. Gold dealers bought twenty taels from silver firms at 5,485 yuan. Subsequently, the price fell back due to selling pressure from securities brokers and silver firms.

<p>Longan and lychee have no connection with a certain market, but since the first of this month, for goods transferred from the Taikoo Dock, people from a certain party have intercepted them and taken them to a certain market. Approximately, the goods can only be released after an evaluation and payment of the market commission. Therefore, the industry has to suffer another layer of exploitation.</p>

<p>— Sheng Kai</p>
<p>The Development of Sino-American Trade</p>
<p>According to a report from the U.S. Department of Commerce, trade between China and the United States has seen great prosperity this year, developing more than in 1936. Analyzing the statistics, the cumulative value of Chinese goods exported to the United States in the first nine months of this year was $70,472,000, an increase of 74% compared to the same period last year and an increase of 16% compared to the normal trade situation in 1936. At the same time, the value of American goods exported to China was $62,250,000. China's trade surplus increased from $5 million last year to $8 million this year. According to experts, the large quantities of raw silk and tung oil shipped from China to the United States and the high prices are the main reasons for China's trade surplus, while the goods exported from the United States to China are mostly cotton and tobacco.</p>
<p>Since the three-year war between China and Japan, not only has China had extreme difficulty exporting due to Japan's aggressive blockade, but also American trade with China has been difficult to develop due to the destruction of interests in China. However, with the continuous efforts of the Chinese and American authorities, this year's trade performance has been able to avoid the impact of the war and has flourished, even surpassing the normal trade situation before the war in 1936. This shows that although Japan has the ability to blockade China, China and the United States can work together to open up new avenues for Chinese trade and develop trade between China and the United States.</p>
<p>The increase in export trade can strengthen the country's finances, and the increase in export trade during wartime can especially strengthen the resistance. Now that China's export trade can offset its import trade and still have a large and favorable trade surplus, it is undoubtedly evident that China's economic power of resistance is strong.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Reasons for the Rise in Public Bonds <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The public bond market saw an upward trend after interest was paid at the end of July. The reasons for the soaring prices at that time were analyzed in the Financial Commentary on August 26th. In the two months from September to the end of October, the market rose. Type A bonds reached the 70 yuan mark, and other bonds were also well above the 60 yuan mark or at the 60 yuan mark. (The following figures are the closing prices at the beginning of the month):</p>
<p>In the order of A, B, C, D, and E, the increase from the beginning of September to the beginning of October was 6, 5, 9, 8, and 8%, respectively. The increase from the beginning of October to the beginning of November was 4, 6, 4, 5, and %, and the total increase from the beginning of September to the beginning of November was 10, 2, 13, 13, and 13%. The severity of the rise can be imagined. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Oil Cake - Oil Brokers at Work - Raw Oil Three Yuan Higher <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, both raw oil and soybean oil prices rose across the board. However, the rise in soybean oil prices was passive, so it only increased by one yuan. The transaction volume was 50 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, priced at 112 yuan to 110 yuan; 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, priced at 75 yuan to 76.5 yuan; 100 pieces of Yantai soybean oil, priced at 77.5 yuan to 78.5 yuan; 200 dan of Da You factory soybean oil, priced at 85 yuan to 85.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Spot peanut oil was still being purchased by Hong Kong merchants, and secondly, the Qingdao market reported a slight increase. Because people are crazy about it, bulls added positions, and shorts covered positions, with insiders and outsiders working together, resulting in a noisy buying atmosphere and frequent price increases. Although there were setbacks along the way, the result was still three yuan higher than the previous day. A total of 300 cans of raw raw oil from local Jiangbei workshops were traded, priced at 99 yuan; over 1,000 pieces of Jiaozhou oil, priced at 71.5 yuan, gradually rising to 73.5 yuan, closing at 73 yuan; 400 pieces for delivery in the second half of November, priced at 73 yuan to 75 yuan; 200 barrels of Qingdao oil, priced at 100 yuan to 101.5 yuan; 1,600 to 1,700 barrels for delivery in the second half of November, priced at 100 yuan to 103.5 yuan, closing at 103.25 yuan; 2,000 barrels for delivery in the second half of December, priced at 101.25 yuan to 104.5 yuan, once falling back to 103.75 yuan, and then returning to 4 yuan at the close.</p>
<p>Today, 2,010 bags of soybeans are being shipped to Hong Kong. Yesterday, 500 cans and 40 pieces of tung oil arrived from Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Yarn and Cotton - Speculative Yarn Merchants See Decline - Double Horse Drops Another Twenty Yuan <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market remained weak. This was due to stagnant real demand, and people's minds have mostly changed, leaning towards the downside. As for general gold dealers and bill of exchange merchants, they are good at speculation, and their goals shift with the trend. Therefore, when prices fall, they still expect them to fall further, and when prices rise, they want to drag them down. This leads to market prices often acting beyond the normal range. Recently, the news released has mostly been negative. Today, 2,035 pieces of cotton yarn are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The sentiment in the spot yarn market was still peaceful at the morning opening, with 20-count Double Horse priced at 1,185 yuan, slightly rising to 1,189 yuan. After hearing the foreign exchange listing, a downtrend reappeared, and the situation fell back, dropping to 1,173 yuan. At this time, short sellers covered positions, and the price rose again to 1,182 yuan. However, actual transactions were scarce and miserable, and the price continued to fall to 1,162 yuan. Those who profited bought in cheaply, and the price rose again to 1,170 yuan. The half-day transaction volume was 5,005 bales, and the price of 20-count Bian Ma fell by 20 yuan. The amount of purchases by each group is listed separately below:</p>
<p>Fellow merchants 4,800 Hong Kong 205</p>
<p>Total 5,005</p>
<h3 id="e69">Cotton Market Quiet <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation remains mediocre and weak, mainly due to the disastrous decline in the yarn market. Factories are closed, and the Indian cotton ordered in the past will arrive in Shanghai on schedule in the coming days. Pingguo Er is priced at 173 yuan, Peng Yipu at 162 yuan to 260 yuan, and Changyinsha at 221 yuan.</p>
<p>In other news, the price of imported cotton: the New York cotton market rose yesterday due to purchases by speculators, but then fell due to selling by the public, and some bulls closed their positions. As a result, closing prices fell by three to five pounds each compared to the previous day. India's spot price fell by over one rupee along with the forecast yesterday.</p>
<p>The transaction of imported cotton in Shanghai has been extremely quiet recently. All parties are adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Futures transactions have not been heard of recently. The sentiment among colleagues is still very high.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Varying Explanations for Yarn Price Decline <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>According to a recent market survey, the factors for the recent sharp decline in the yarn market are: (1) Sichuan yarn prices have fallen by over 1,000 yuan; (2) there are slight sources of raw cotton; (3) the purchasing by guest merchants has turned sluggish; (4) reports indicate that the Japanese are withdrawing; (5) the rising foreign exchange trend is becoming more severe; (6) the supply of Blue Phoenix Standard yarn for 16-count yarn is sufficient, and the profit margin is quite high. Due to the above factors, the market is trending downward.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Food - Japonica Rice Rose Sharply in the Morning Market - Influenced by Foreign Rice in the Afternoon Market and Also Became Stable <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw a general sense of discouragement among囤积户 due to rumors of successive victories by the National Army, resulting in many sell-offs. At the same time, due to the arrival of entire batches of foreign rice and a large amount of goods on the way, coupled with foreign pricing based on a weaker exchange rate, the market supply exceeded demand, and the original packages were barely consulted. Those holding goods were eager to sell, so prices fell successively all the way until the market closed without any recovery. The closing price was generally one yuan lower than before, with No. 1 New Saigon at 66 yuan to 65.5 yuan, No. 2 at 61.2 yuan to 60.05 yuan, Huojiao at 64.2 yuan and 63 yuan, Zhen Tebie at 67.6 yuan, No. 2 at 59.5 yuan and 58.5 yuan, Xiaowen at 59 yuan and 58.7 yuan, Suijian at 51 yuan and 50 yuan, Micha at 54 yuan and 53 yuan, Ci at 52 yuan, Tokyo Pojian at 58.3 yuan, and Wuhu Jian at 58.3 yuan. The selling pressure was very strong in the afternoon, with floating households seeking to sell but lacking buyers, and the price fell again by a small three, four, or five jiao. As a result, it was one yuan and three or four jiao lower than the previous night. Less than 4,000 bags were traded because both guest merchants and囤积户 were silent, and shop owners also saw dullness in selling at the same price. New transactions of 700 tons were completed, with Xiaojiao opening at 70 yuan and No. 2 Saigon at 71 yuan, both for shipment next month.</p>
<p>The arrival of new japonica rice, kiln-cultivated wild rice, and other types of rice was still only over 1,000 shi, but sales were brisk in the morning market. Because general guest merchants carried on the upward trend from the previous day, mutual purchases were particularly strong. At that time, cargo owners were exceptionally keen on raising prices, and shouts rose repeatedly. Prices for all types of japonica rice increased by half a yuan to one yuan. New japonica original package opened at 79 yuan and 78.5 yuan, 斛见 at 74.5 yuan and 73 yuan, kiln-cultivated rice at 80 yuan, then at 78 and 79 yuan, wild rice at 80 yuan, 78 and 79 yuan, Dujian 解见 at 68.5 yuan, then at 66 yuan, original package at 70 yuan, Yangjian 斛见 at 68 yuan, and original package also sold at 70 yuan. However, the market softened in the late morning due to the impact of the decline in foreign rice prices. Selling prices were similar to before. Broken rice still had no market. Transactions with glutinous rice wine shops and rice carriers were still scarce, resulting in prices being weak by five or six jiao to　砠 and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Flour Price Stabilized <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Flour prices were generally stable yesterday. The盘 of Factory No.　号粉厂 remained at 17 yuan. The two factories sold 8,000 to 9,000 bags, which met the daily needs of the street. Due to a lack of buyers and voices of higher rice prices, cargo owners intended to hold on and wait for an opportunity, so Laoche　单 had stabilized at 18.8 yuan. The prices of other brands of foreign flour also stabilized at around 19 yuan because the arrival of 定粉 was at least ten days away. However, there were no official transactions. It was reported that 200 bags of Phoenix brand回笼 goods from the Japanese factory were sold at 17.4 yuan, and the market was also very dull.</p>
<p>Wheat transactions remained quiet yesterday. Due to the weekend, sales by Chinese factories and other channels were suspended. Only the Japanese factories occasionally sent dozens to hundreds of bags of near-suburban wheat, with prices still around 21 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Minds on Transactions - Invisibility Stops <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth - Sentiment is low, customers wait and see, and transactions are scarce. However, those holding goods are calm, so the decline is still moderate. White goods, coarse and fine cloths, and twills fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. The price of some dyed cloths fell by about 5 jiao per piece. About 200 pieces of various goods were transacted in the street. Intentional hoarding business invisibly stops. Zhejiang and Fujian merchants purchased over 100 pieces of colored twill coarse and fine cloths. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants purchased over 200 pieces of colored cloths and dyed cloths. North Road Yantai merchants purchased over 100 pieces of coarse cloths and flannelette. There are one thousand eight hundred and forty pieces of piece goods transported to Hong Kong on the third and forty five pieces transported to Yantai.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth - The decline continues. White goods Longtou fine cloth opened at 35 yuan in the morning. General small floating households panicked and sold, dropping to 34.4 yuan. Later, industry giants remained calm, and the market opened again at 34.9 yuan. Due to a lack of buyers, it fell again to 34.5 yuan, continuing to fall by one yuan per piece compared to the previous day. Fine twill fell by 5 to 7.5 jiao, and serge closed at 1.075 yuan, also falling by 4.25 fen per yard. However, industry factory selling disks remain firm. It is heard that the output of each industry during the current reduced working period is not enough to be sold directly to North China and the Yangtze River. Therefore, there are repeated restrictions on shipments by Chinese merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Sugar Market - Sugar Transactions Remain Stagnant <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market was stagnant yesterday, and transactions were exceptionally quiet. The association's disk price for spot No. 1 coarse white sugar at 本栈 was 71.5 yuan, a small 5 jiao. There were no transactions outside the 栈. The перевал price was 56.5 yuan, one yuan smaller than before (30th). Spot for Dutch red sugar was 54 yuan, a small 3 jiao. Taikoo Car White DY mark was 65.3 yuan, and HX mark 本栈 immediately sold at 66 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Coal - Indian Anthracite Tightening Under the Table <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Indian anthracite had previously fallen back near 200 yuan due to weak sales, but recently, street customers have gradually started searching for it, and the arrival of shipments that have been brewing for many days is still uncertain. Therefore, those囤货户holding goods are unwilling to sell them lightly, and the industry market has tightened under the table. Yesterday, Indian standard coal traded at 200 yuan per ton, screened blocks at 205 yuan, and coal dust at 185 yuan. The price is for delivery at the warehouse, and external expenses are borne by the buyer.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Miscellaneous - Cigarette Outlets Narrow <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette market is trending flat. Because various places are under Japanese control, they cannot be shipped out in batches, and only a small number are managed to be shipped out, so the market price is stable. Yesterday's market prices were 1,300 yuan for the Great Britain brand, 900 yuan for the Lao Ren brand, 850 yuan for the Pin Hai brand, all according to the industry market price. The prices for Little Fairy brand were 659 yuan, Five Flowers brand 653 yuan, Hard Struggle 670 yuan, ten-pack Qianmen brand 340 yuan per 10,000, fifty-pack Qianmen brand 340 yuan per 10,000, fifty-pack Great Britain brand 275 yuan per 10,000, fifty-pack Da Sanpao 614 yuan per 10,000, fifty-pack Xiao Sanpao 530 yuan per 10,000. Golden City Company's fifty-pack Fada Er were 1,120 yuan, fifty-pack Xiao Keleisi 1,120 yuan. The new prices were 350 yuan for Yuan Tai Company's ten-pack gold tin, 340 yuan for twenty-pack gold tin, and 404 yuan for Yu Hua Company's Chaopiao brand. Due to the recent soaring raw material prices, the industry market price has been raised. (Kun)</p>
<h3 id="e77">Seafood - Scallop Transactions Sporadic <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The source of scallops is still not lacking, so the market has sufficient supply. However, Hong Kong merchants have stopped purchasing recently, and transactions are only sporadic, with a flat trend. Currently, 外山貨 is sold at 95 yuan, and Zhoushan goods at 135 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan from before.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Qicai Varieties Incomplete <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Since the market price of Qicai rose by five yuan before, the arrival of goods is still rare. The varieties in the market are incomplete. Currently, Chongshi Mao Cai has to be sold at 73.7 yuan, a significant increase from before, and a batch of Yamencai was sold, with prices ranging from 56.6 yuan, 57.8 yuan, to 60.08 yuan, and 62 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Metals Bamboo Joint Steel Bars Slacken <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Bamboo joint steel bars are essential for construction. Recently, the Shanghai real estate industry has declined, leading to a decrease in construction, and the demand for steel bars has also decreased. Orders from places such as Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and Wuhu are also rare. There is still no improvement in the inland rivers of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, so the market atmosphere is gradually slackening. Currently, such as three or four points of variety, sold at 1,150 yuan per ton. Goods ranging from three-tenths to one inch are quoted at 1,070 to 1,100 yuan per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e80">The First U.S. Chartered Ship Arrives in Shanghai; Over 300 American Nationals Evacuate; Departs Tonight at Midnight for Manila; Representatives from Matson Company Arrive in Shanghai to Assist <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The U.S. State Department has dispatched three chartered ships to the Far East to evacuate American nationals (originally four, but the Manhattan did not set sail). The first of these, the Matson Navigation Company's Mundelein, arrived at Pier 11/12 in the Huangpu River at approximately 3 PM yesterday. It is understood that there are 58 women and children on board who embarked in Japan. It is estimated that over 300 people will evacuate from Shanghai on this ship, the majority of whom are dependents of U.S. Navy Marine Detachment and consulate personnel, with the total not exceeding 500. It is scheduled to weigh anchor and depart from Shanghai at midnight tonight (i.e., 1 AM on the 4th). The itinerary, as announced by the shipping company yesterday, has been slightly modified and will not stop in Hong Kong, but will instead proceed directly to Manila, load American nationals evacuated from there, and then sail to Australia, where 140 people will disembark. It is said that only around 350 people will disembark at the destination, San Francisco.</p>
<p>Matson Sends Representatives to Shanghai with the Ship</p>
<p>Out of caution, the Matson Company specifically appointed Mr. Piplni to lead a team of four people to come to Shanghai with the ship to assist the U.S. President Lines in handling ticket procedures. The tickets and various documents were brought by Mr. Piplni. The U.S. President Lines had previously collected passenger fares and issued temporary receipts, which are scheduled to be exchanged for Matson Company's official tickets this morning. After the ship arrived in Shanghai, the U.S. President Lines' Shanghai office sent a large team to welcome Mr. Piplni on board. He and the other four members then took a small boat to the New Customs Wharf to disembark, took a short rest at the company, and worked overnight to complete the passenger ticket procedures, so that they could be exchanged this morning. Therefore, the Western and Chinese staff in the passenger ticket department of the President Lines were extremely busy yesterday after the ship arrived. Furthermore, Mr. Piplni and the other four will not return to the U.S. on the Mundelein, but will stay in Shanghai for a short period and then return to the U.S. on the Mariposa after it arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Passengers on Board Go Ashore for Sightseeing</p>
<p>At 2:30 PM yesterday, when the Mundelein arrived in Shanghai, ferries went to meet it. Less than a dozen people were leaning on the railings on board. At that time, a group of reporters and photographers swarmed on board, some holding pencils and asking questions, others holding cameras and looking for shots. More than 150 passengers were standing in the corridors, quietly waiting for permission to leave the ship so that they could take the ferry to the city and go ashore for sightseeing. At that time, the main question asked by the reporters was, "Have you been to Shanghai before?" Most replied, "No." According to one of the American nationals evacuating on the ship, there are approximately 14,000 American nationals living in Japan, who are currently waiting to see the results of the U.S. presidential election before deciding whether to evacuate the Far East. However, the majority have already applied for and reserved cabins.</p>
<p>American Women Residing in Japan Talk About Their Impressions</p>
<p>American women residing in Japan, influenced by Japanese propaganda, mostly do not want to leave their husbands and return home. They doubt whether a large-scale evacuation is necessary. The few women who are leaving Japan this time are mostly doing so because they have been urged by their husbands. One middle-aged American woman said, "I am returning to my home country because I have to return to my home country sooner or later. In fact, I don't know what to do after I arrive in the U.S., but I expect that when I arrive in the U.S., my husband will send a letter telling me what to do." Another woman said that she only decided to return home three days before the ship sailed. The woman was carrying a seven-year-old boy. Her ideal is that when the Mundelein arrives in San Francisco, she may be able to meet her husband there. Although her husband is currently staying in Tokyo, he can pack up and leave Japan to return to the U.S. at any time. "A young girl and her younger brother are returning home on the same ship. "I don't know where I'm going, but I'm already going. When I arrive in the U.S., my relatives and friends will welcome me home, so I have nothing to worry about." However, most of the women interviewed by reporters did not know what they would do after returning home. Before leaving Japan, the schedule was very tight, and there was no time to determine plans after returning to the U.S.</p>
<p>More People Will Leave on the Next Two Ships</p>
<p>According to investigations by reporters, the Mundelein has cabin space for 695 passengers, but the number of evacuees from Japan and Shanghai is only half of that number, because it has to detour through Australia before returning to the U.S., and the journey is as long as two months, so most American nationals are unwilling to take this ship back to the U.S. It is expected that most of the American nationals in Shanghai who are preparing to follow the U.S. State Department's orders and evacuate will leave Shanghai on the Mariposa or Washington in the middle and late part of this month. As the U.S. government has already announced measures to assist American nationals who cannot afford to evacuate, the number of evacuees will definitely increase at that time. The Mariposa will arrive in Shanghai on the 10th, and the Washington will arrive on the 19th.</p>
<p>Government Subsidies Solve Difficulties</p>
<p>American nationals in Shanghai were greatly relieved to receive news that the U.S. State Department had recently remitted a small amount of funds to evacuate impoverished American nationals in the Far East. According to a spokesperson for the U.S. Consulate General yesterday morning, the funds allocated by the State Department are not large, but they are sufficient to solve the evacuation problem of American nationals in Shanghai with low salaries or those who are destitute. According to the American Chamber of Commerce, the State Department's announcement of economic assistance and a reduction in Washington's ticket prices means that the entire evacuation problem has now been solved. It is expected that all American nationals in the Far East, regardless of whether they have financial resources or not, will be able to evacuate soon.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily News reports that yesterday morning (the 1st), telephone lines in the Hongqiao District were stolen again. Since the end of the Shanghai war, and after telephone communications in the area were restored, telephone lines have been stolen more than 37 times. The lines stolen yesterday morning were between MacLeod Road and North Xinjing, 350 feet long, containing 101 pairs of wires, causing 35 telephone users west of that location to have no telephone service to this day. According to a certain employee of the Shanghai Telephone Company yesterday, the stolen lines are currently being reinstalled as quickly as possible, and it is hoped that telephone communications can be restored on Saturday night.</p>

<p>Recently, the retail prices of various coal and charcoal shops in the wooden wharf and the two concession areas have been inconsistent, resulting in prices higher than the limit set by the Fair Price Committee, and some have been penalized. A reporter from the Pingming News Agency recently learned from the Coal and Charcoal Industry Association that the association has set the following retail prices: Lao Bei coal 7 yuan 2 jiao, Hongji white coal and fines 12 yuan 4 jiao, bituminous coal 11 yuan. The above are based on a unit of dan, weighing 100 catties. Number one warm charcoal is 14 yuan per basket, weighing 30 market catties, large basket of green charcoal 12 yuan, medium basket of green charcoal 10 yuan, large reverse white firewood 7 jiao 5 fen per piece, medium reverse white firewood 6 jiao, small reverse white firewood 3 jiao 5 fen, large charcoal knot 1 and a half fen. Recently, the industry association carefully marked the price list and notified all coal and charcoal shops to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e86">American Journalists Question the Japanese Attack on China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Aircraft; Japanese Spokesman Has No Answer; Shanghai Press Sends Condolences for Colleagues Killed <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese-language paper Zilin Bao reported that during a reception for journalists in Shanghai yesterday (the 1st), American journalists questioned the Japanese spokesman about the shooting down of a China National Aviation Corporation transport plane, which resulted in the tragic deaths of the well-known American pilot Cante and others. The Japanese Navy spokesman said that he could not make a statement and only knew from indirect reports here that a Japanese aircraft had shot down an enemy aircraft. A reporter immediately asked whether the Japanese side had a policy of shooting down civilian transport aircraft on fixed routes, or whether it was an accidental event. The spokesman paused and replied that, based on the information received, the Japanese aircraft must have mistaken the aircraft for a Chinese aircraft, but he was not prepared to discuss Japanese policy.</p>
<p>Answers Exhausted, No Further Discussion</p>
<p>Another American reporter asked if the five aircraft that carried out the attack could all be mistaken. The spokesman said that all five aircraft were fighter aircraft, each with only one person. A reporter still felt dissatisfied with this answer and said that Japanese pilots, who had been trained, should know the difference between civilian transport aircraft and Chinese fighter aircraft, and even ordinary people could tell the difference. Another American reporter added that not only that, but the transport aircraft all had clear markings that the American side was a shareholder in the CNAC, and wanted to know what the Japanese side's policy was regarding transport aircraft. The spokesman replied that he felt unable to discuss the matter any further.</p>
<p>Military Retreat, Many Evasive Words</p>
<p>Army spokesman Colonel Saito said that the Chinese army entered Nanning and Shaoxing after the Japanese army withdrew, similar to "beggars picking up discarded cigarette butts." A reporter asked if the Japanese army had already withdrawn from Yichang, and Saito said that this statement was only "Chongqing's expression of hope that the cigarette butts would be dropped quickly." A reporter asked if Yichang could indeed be classified as a cigarette butt, and the spokesman did not answer, but believed that the Japanese army's withdrawal from Nanning was the initial step in the overall retreat from South China. It was claimed that the withdrawal was "only from Nanning." Regarding the anti-Japanese incident in Pudong, he had never heard of it. In answering questions about the bombing of two bridges on the Yunnan-Burma Road, the Navy spokesman admitted that the Nujiang and Lancangjiang bridges had been damaged, but traffic would not be completely disrupted. He also said that the quantity and nature of Japanese goods transported on the Yunnan-Burma Road were not of great importance to the progress of the war, but damaging the two bridges could affect the "enemy's morale."</p>
<p>Reporters Killed, Shanghai Sends Condolences</p>
<p>In this attack on the CNAC aircraft, the well-known reporters Fan Changjiang and Qu Luyi tragically died. When the bad news came, the Shanghai press felt deep sorrow and mourning. A telegram has been sent to Chongqing to inquire about the details and express condolences to the families. All CNAC passenger aircraft are still operating smoothly. The company's Chongqing-Hong Kong route continues to stop at Guilin station en route, and other Chongqing-Chengdu route, Chongqing-Jia route, Chongqing-Yangon route, etc. also fly as usual, also stopping at Wanzhou, Luzhou, Xufu and other places en route.</p>
<h3 id="e87">English Playwright Coward to Lecture on Behalf of Britain; Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Broadcasts on Radio in the Evening; Coward Highly Reputed for Playwriting <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," the renowned British playwright Coward has been lecturing in the United States on behalf of the British government for the past several months. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon (the 2nd) aboard the American President Lines vessel "President Monde," and will continue on the same ship to Australia, then to various locations around the world for lectures. At 8:15 this evening, Coward will give a talk on the city's British-run wireless radio station. He is scheduled to depart on the "President Monde" early Monday morning. The last tender to take passengers to the ship is scheduled to leave the Customs Wharf at 11:00 PM tomorrow (the 2nd). Coward is currently 41 years old and dedicated himself to the stage in his youth. Afterwards he continued to act and write, and in 1926, "numerous famous plays were published, and his name began to be known widely." Three years later, he devoted himself to writing musical comedies, which were very successful. In 1930, a number of famous plays were published, and his reputation increased. Although no famous plays have been published in recent years, his autobiography, published three years ago, was also a popular success.</p>
<p>Coward's Talk</p>
<p>Coward, at the invitation of the Australian government, traveled to Australia from the United States on the "President Monde." After his radio broadcast last night, he told reporters that the attention of the American people is currently mostly focused on the upcoming presidential election, and they are more concerned about it than about the war in Europe and the evacuation of expatriates from the Far East. He knows the most about the war in Europe because he just left London in July. He also stayed in Paris for a while, but he did not have the chance to meet Hitler. Coward, as a first-class British playwright, volunteered to work for the country at the beginning of the European war. He worked in propaganda for the first eight months, mostly in Paris, and then went to the United States. When asked by reporters about his feelings on the recent unpleasant criticism of him in the British House of Commons, Coward said that this was unfortunate. However, in this time of national crisis, there are many important things that need to be done, and it is a pity that members of the House of Commons are able to take their time and aimlessly criticize trivial matters. It is said that Coward will temporarily give up his life as a playwright. He said that the people are suffering from the scourge of the war of aggression, and the suffering is beyond words. He has no intention of writing comedies that make people laugh.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Rice Stored in Pudong Rice Warehouses; Methods for Transporting it Across the River; Rice Prices Drop After Implementation of Rice Price Control; Approximately 100,000 Tons of Rice Stored in this City <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Due to the influx of foreign rice, rice prices have been falling rapidly in the rice market in recent days. Although some speculators made large purchases the day before yesterday, they eventually stopped due to the excessive influx of goods. After the rice market opened yesterday, it immediately showed an oversupply. The market price of foreign rice per shi (unit of dry measure) fell again by about one yuan. It is said that the fall in rice prices is due to the abundant autumn harvest and abundant supply, as well as the fact that the Rice Price Control Association is holding sales of broken rice, reducing the sales of foreign rice.</p>
<p>Quantity of Rice Price Control Sales</p>
<p>Currently, the 60 rice shops in the two concessions that are conducting rice price control sales are selling a total of 1,500 bags of broken rice per day. The actual sales of rice in the city are less than 10,000 shi per day, so the amount of broken rice sold in this price control sale accounts for more than two-tenths of the city's actual sales. Therefore, holding price control sales not only helps the common people in a passive way, but also lowers rice prices in an active way. However, it is learned that after the association has sold off the existing 28,000 bags of broken rice, it may temporarily suspend operations if funding is not available. This measure is related to helping the poor in the city and suppressing rice prices. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate generously so that price control sales can continue.</p>
<p>Rice Warehouses Crossing the River</p>
<p>According to news from the rice market yesterday, rice merchants in the city's rice warehouses, mostly those of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., have been subject to robbery when transporting rice from Pudong rice warehouses to the concessions, resulting in significant losses. It is said that the Rice Industry Association has agreed on a concrete plan: If rice shops transport rice from Pudong to the concessions, they will pay four cents per bag to hire people to protect it. The above plan will be formally announced and implemented within a few days after it is passed by the entire market committee.</p>
<p>Arrival and Sales Statistics</p>
<p>The annual demand for rice in this city is approximately 290,000 tons, and the demand for nine months is approximately 218,000 tons. The import of foreign rice from January to September this year reached 327,256 tons, an oversupply of approximately 109,000 tons, which is sufficient to meet the needs of four and a half months. Shanghai will import 20,000 tons of foreign rice every month in the future, requiring US$800,000 in foreign exchange. In 1939, Shanghai imported approximately 244,300 tons of domestic rice and only 45,700 tons of foreign rice. This year, the situation is the opposite: 300,000 tons of foreign rice have been imported, and less than 40,000 tons of domestic rice. It is also reported that the transaction price for the 27th batch of group rice purchases was 71 yuan per bag.</p>

<p>The International Wireless Radio Station, an American company in this city, originally transmitted and received telegrams between this city and Geneva, Switzerland, via Rome, Berlin, and San Francisco. A reporter from the "Ping Ming" news agency recently learned that the radio station had successfully tested direct telegrams between this city and Geneva last week. This saves more time compared to relaying through various places, so the radio station has recently begun to transmit and receive direct telegrams to and from Geneva.

<p>The issue of repatriating young and strong refugees from various shelters in this city has been discussed and decided upon by various charitable organizations such as the Refugee Relief Association, the United International Famine Relief Committee, and its branch. It has now been decided that all able-bodied refugees in the shelters will be given funds and repatriated before the 10th of this month. The repatriation fee is 20 yuan per person for able-bodied refugees and 17 yuan for those who are slightly younger. It is said that the charitable organizations have also agreed on "standards for refugees to stay or leave" and distributed them to various shelters to serve as a guide for whether or not to implement repatriation. Those who are determined to continue to be cared for include the following four types: (1) the elderly (age 60 or above), (2) the disabled, (3) the orphaned and widowed, and (4) school-age children (age 19 or below). However, those with special circumstances, such as those without reliable relatives or unable to make a living, are also allowed to continue to be sheltered. The shelters are now rushing to prepare lists of refugees to stay or leave and actively preparing. The repatriation work should be completed before the 10th of this month. Although the charitable organizations are repatriating a large number of young and strong refugees this time, the number of those who continue to be cared for is still huge. Currently, the charitable organizations are facing ever-increasing living expenses and increasing refugee relief. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate generously so that the work of caring for the elderly and raising the young can continue, and countless poor refugees will not suffer the pain of displacement again.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "China Press," after Japanese military police corporal Saito Seiichi was assassinated on Yu Yuan Road two weeks ago, the Japanese military police corps has been thoroughly searching all vehicles passing through Jing'an Temple, greatly hindering and disrupting the operations of the public bus company, especially in the western district. Public buses are stopped at the intersection of Difeng Road, Jing'an Temple Road, and Yu Yuan Road.</p>
<p>Chinese Passengers</p>
<p>Must Get Off</p>
<p>and sign a registration paper. The length of time this takes depends on the number of passengers, usually taking 15 to 20 minutes. As a result, the intersection is heavily congested, and public buses are lined up end to end on the side of the road, disrupting the bus company's schedule. Some people believe that the Japanese are using Saito's assassination as an excuse to try to force the public bus business out of the Yu Yuan Road area. A senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Police stated this morning (the 1st) that the public bus company had not yet</p>
<p>Filed a Protest</p>
<p>with the police. The Japanese military police have set up obstacles around Difeng Road and are searching public buses, and the motive is purely to prevent crime and not to force the public bus business out of the western district. However, the search operation undoubtedly causes great inconvenience to the public bus company and delays normal travel time.</p>

<p>The American President Lines' round-the-world President Harrison, which was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday and depart for Hong Kong, various ports in Southeast Asia, and India today, before returning to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, the company suddenly announced yesterday that the round-the-world President Harrison liner, which departed from the United States this time,</p>

<h3 id="e94">Price of Group-Ordered Rice for the 27th Period; 71 Yuan Per Bag <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association has repeatedly ordered Saigon foreign rice on behalf of major factories, businesses, and organizations. The 25th period has all been telegraphed to complete the transaction, totaling 1,000 bags, with a transaction price of 75.5 yuan per bag. The 26th period totaled 1,250 bags, with a transaction price of 72.85 yuan per bag. As for the 27th period, it was also telegraphed to complete the transaction a few days ago, totaling more than 1,000 bags, with a transaction price of 71 yuan per bag. The completed transaction rice will all be loaded and shipped to the port and distributed to the respective designated customers who have purchased it. According to the association's statement yesterday, from the first period to the 27th period, a total of about 67,000 bags of Saigon rice have been purchased on behalf of others. According to the person in charge of the association, the group purchase of rice by all sectors is not only beneficial to oneself, but also related to the overall social security, especially at a time when the international situation is turbulent. The rice reserves in the Shanghai rice warehouses urgently need to be increased, otherwise the prices of rice in various shops are likely to be raised at any time by speculative rice merchants. Therefore, it is hoped that Chinese and foreign residents in the city will actively participate in the group purchase of foreign rice or initiate the purchase of rice on their own.</p>
<p>Recent Statistics on the Number of Refugees</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department's report on October 31, there are currently 13 shelters that have been inspected, accommodating a total of 15,395 refugees.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "China Press," the Japanese military authorities here today (the 2nd) detained four German, Italian, and Portuguese commercial river vessels at the Fish Market Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession and confiscated silk and cotton goods worth more than 2 million yuan. The four vessels detained were the Italian vessels Santoro Santorini and Lippeli (both transliterations), the Portuguese vessel Lumaru, and the German vessel Haiyi. The Japanese have not yet explained the reason for confiscating the cargo on the four vessels. It is said that the relevant consulate will protest to the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Stern Action</p>
<p>by the Japanese. The German vessel Haiyi suffered the heaviest losses, as the vessel often carried 200 dan of the best-quality silk from Wuxi. It is said that each dan of silk is worth more than 8,000 yuan and was transported to Shanghai on behalf of Chinese and foreign merchants. The other three vessels detained were carrying only cotton, worth about 500,000 yuan, which was also confiscated. It is said that all four vessels arrived in Shanghai last night. When they were about to dock at the Bund in the Public Concession, the Japanese suddenly ordered them to sail to the pontoon wharf in front of the Fish Market Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession near the South City. The cargo on the vessels was thoroughly searched by the Japanese last night and this morning and unloaded into</p>
<p>Japanese Motorboats.</p>
<p>Also, the river vessels "Kanghao" (German merchant) and "Lipinghao" (Portuguese merchant) anchored outside Wusongkou this morning. After learning of the detention of the four vessels, they quietly sailed to the pontoon wharf downstream of the Bund in the Public Concession to unload their cargo. It is expected that these two vessels will also be detained by the Japanese authorities, pending the outcome of the protests lodged by the relevant consulates with the Japanese consulate before a decision is made.

<p>A major robbery occurred at the Huayuan Hotel on Zhejiang Road at approximately 8:35 PM last night. The victim was Zhang Kejie, a businessman from Jiujiang who deals in department store goods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Coming to Shanghai to Purchase Goods</p>
<p>Zhang Kejie, 39 years old, from Nanjing, runs the Xieshun Department Store in Jiujiang. He came to Shanghai by boat with his father, Haibang (54 years old), his wife, Zhang Shunhua (in her thirties), and two children, a son named Songqing, 3 years old, and a daughter named Qiaoqing, just over one year old, on the 24th of last month. They stayed in Room 106 of the Huayuan Hotel at No. 211 Xiaohuayuan on Zhejiang Road. In recent days, Kejie has been going to the Xintai Chang Department Store on Gongguan Road to purchase a large amount of goods. Unexpectedly, at approximately 8:35 PM last night, two robbers wearing black cloth Zhongshan suits suddenly broke in, each with a pistol in hand.</p>
<p>Sudden Arrival of Robbers</p>
<p>They first closed the door tightly. At that time, Kejie was lying on the bed after dinner, his father, Haibang, was playing with his grandchildren on the sofa, and his daughter-in-law, Shundong, was rushing to make winter clothes at the table. When they suddenly saw the violent guests, they were all stunned and dared not move. The two robbers forced the family to the bedside and ordered them to open a rattan box under the bed, which contained 500 yuan in legal currency and a large amount of brilliant gold jewelry, including two gold necklaces, two gold bracelets, three gold rings, a full set of tea coasters, and a gold ingot weighing more than two or three taels, a total of more than thirty taels of gold jewelry. The two robbers put everything on the coffee table. They also robbed a pocket watch and a wallet from the cupboard, which contained more than 30 yuan, worth more than 20,000 yuan in total.</p>
<p>Robbed of Everything</p>
<p>Everything was put into the two robbers' suit pants pockets. At that time, Kejie witnessed the robbery being almost complete. Because he was terrified by the power of the robbers, he remained silent and suddenly came up with an idea. He used his left arm to press the electric bell on the wall, hoping that the waiter would come and ask for help. Before long, the bell rang and waiter No. 14, Hou Zhaolun (18 years old, from Yangzhou), arrived. When the robbers heard the bell, they hurriedly opened the door and fled. As soon as they reached the door, they met Zhaolun and pointed a pistol at his chest, forcing him to go out with them and wait in the lobby, forbidding him to make a sound. One robber fled to the north gate, and the other fled to the front gate,</p>
<p>Pursuit With No Trace</p>
<p>And disappeared without a trace. They then reported to the Zhenfang and telegraphed the Old Gate Police Station, which sent armed detectives to rush to the scene. But the robbers had already fled far away. They then brought Zhang Kejie and waiter No. 14, Hou Zhaolun, to the police station for questioning. Afterwards, reporters went to the room to investigate. According to Zhang Haibang, the large amount of gold jewelry was intended to be brought to Shanghai to exchange for money at a jewelry store in order to purchase more goods and transport them back to Jiujiang for sale, but the gold price has fallen back, so the transaction has not been completed.</p>

<p>At approximately 7:00 AM yesterday morning, three kidnappers suddenly went to the Tongtai Bean Shop opened by Ding Zhiren from Pudong at No. 110 Shunde Road, Maigen Road, in the western district of the Public Concession. They brandished two pistols and threatened more than a dozen partners and old stewards who were having breakfast in the shop. They immediately kidnapped Ding Hongru (17 years old), an apprentice from Pudong who was in the shop, and fled in taxi No. 18440 of the Xiang Sheng Taxi Company, which was parked at the door. They disappeared without a trace. Previously, at approximately 6:00 AM, a customer claiming to be from a certain inn in the Yongan Lane on Maigen Road needed a taxi at the Xinzha Road Mai Te He Si Te Road Sheng Sheng branch. The station dispatched driver Cai A Si (50 years old, from Ningbo) to drive. Unexpectedly, after Cai drove out, he was monitored by the kidnappers. Ding's whereabouts are still unknown. The taxi was found an hour later at No. 96 Jisi Feier Road. It is said that the kidnapping of the apprentice was because he had the same surname as the shop owner and was from the same hometown, and they mistakenly identified him as the young owner of the bean shop. It was actually a mistaken kidnapping.</p>

<p>The US election is scheduled for November 5th, the day after tomorrow. At that time, as many as 46 million people will vote, deciding whether Democratic President Roosevelt will be re-elected or Republican candidate Willkie will be elected. In such a large country, the procedures for presidential elections are extremely cumbersome. Looking back at the election of the first US President, Washington, only a few electors voted in convenient locations, and in some places, it took as long as three weeks to learn of Washington's election. However, the results of this election will be known worldwide within three hours of the polls closing, a speed that is truly incomparable to the past.</p>
<p>To achieve a rapid revelation of election results, the prerequisite is to obtain the simplest and highest degree of speed between calculating votes and reporting news. The United States is now able to achieve this goal using scientific methods. The accuracy, simplicity, and speed of elections are the unique secrets of the United States, and it is proud of them among democratic countries.</p>
<p>The voting recorder, the oldest type, existed in Europe in the mid-nineteenth century. At that time, Germany used black and white balls to represent votes. The great inventor Edison created a voting recorder in 1869, which was the beginning of such machines in the United States. Someone in England also created such a thing.</p>
<p>Later, improvements were gradually made, combining voting and statistics into one machine. The inventor was Father Victorito, from Scillina, Sicily. His machine was a large box, divided into several small compartments according to the number of candidates. When the pointer of the calculator turned, a loud bell rang inside. Soon after, the United States completely created voting machines using mechanical construction methods. One type was made by McTammany, with a key for each candidate that would not mix. It also used an air machine to calculate the number of holes in the paper tape.</p>
<p>The voting machine currently used in the United States is actually a mechanized ballot box. Each machine is covered with a curtain. The front is divided into several columns, each representing a party. All the candidates in each column are represented by a horizontal bar with their name written on it. When a voter votes, they first move the machine button on the left. They select a column of a certain party, then aim the indicator needle at the name of the person they want to vote for, and drag the handle above, and the vote is counted. After such a drag, the elected person has one more vote, and at the same time, the total number of votes they have received is calculated. After one person has passed, the indicator needle and curtain return to their original state, waiting for the second person to vote.</p>
<p>The advantages of this voting machine are sixfold: (1) Accurate calculation by machine avoids human error. (2) Statistics of the total number of votes can be obtained immediately. (3) Avoidance of invalid votes. (4) Permanent records can be obtained without re-counting or re-calculating. (5) Election costs can be reduced. (6) Complete confidentiality in elections is maintained. In addition to these six advantages, the only slight regret is that the initial purchase cost is quite considerable. Moreover, the machine body is quite large, and the freight and storage costs are also quite high. The smallest type of voting machine can accommodate 270 names of candidates, each costing US$800. The price of larger ones also increases accordingly. The largest type can include nine parties, with up to seventy candidates per party. There is also a "yes" or "no" proposal statistics counter installed inside. If the name of the person the voter wants to vote for is not listed on the machine, they can write the name on a piece of paper, which is also attached to the voting machine. If this voting machine is carefully inspected beforehand, properly sealed afterwards, and several keen-eyed and quick-handed supervisors are present to observe, there will be no abuses or errors to speak of. Although the use of this type of voting machine cannot be called perfect, it is generally extremely effective in terms of speed, accuracy, and simplicity, so its use is very common. Even when not electing a president, such as during ordinary labor union or school elections, the use of this machine is quite frequent.</p>
<p>The United States has a vast territory, and there are considerable time differences between different regions, so elections always proceed from east to west. The village of New Ashford in Massachusetts often prides itself on handling elections the fastest. From 1912 to 1936, this "championship" was always won by this village. On the day of the general election, the totals of the various small places can be announced in the afternoon newspapers. But the largest numbers all depend on New York City and New York State. After the totals of these two areas are calculated, the fate of the candidates is mostly already decided. The totals for these two places will not be known until morning. New York State has forty-seven electoral votes, more than any other state. For twenty-four years, no candidate favored by New York State has ever failed.</p>
<p>All 1.7 million votes in New York City are recorded by 4,300 voting machines. In addition, 2.1 million votes in other places are also recorded using the same method. Once the election in New York is over and the ballot boxes are sealed, the police officers maintaining order at each polling place immediately notify the district election office of the totals recorded at each polling place. Newspaper reporters from local newspapers or news agencies have been waiting there for a long time, and as soon as the totals are announced, they immediately send the news to various places.</p>
<p>In addition to New York City, the police in various parts of New York State also help during elections. Buffalo is the second largest city in New York State. On election day, suburban police officers ride motorcycles into the city center, collecting the election totals along the way. About 218,000 people voted in the entire city, and the number of candidates is also very large. However, all election procedures can be completed and the final totals obtained within ninety minutes. Without the use of mechanical methods, how could it be so fast? Therefore, the statewide totals for New York State are known to the public within two hours of the polls closing.</p>
<p>New York State is a pioneer in the use of voting machines, and it vigorously promotes the mechanization of all election procedures, so its rapid handling is to be expected. The first voting machine used in New York State was the Myer's type. In 1892, it was first used in the inventor's hometown of Lockport. Cazenovia and Rochester successively adopted voting machines in 1894. By 1899, Buffalo and its surrounding cities were also using this machine. New York City ordered the use of voting machines in 1925 during the tenure of Mayor Walker. The total number of voting machines currently used in New York State exceeds 30,000.</p>
<p>Before the use of voting machines, the ballots used by citizens to vote also underwent several reforms. Initially, each party and faction used its own ballots. Later, due to abuses, it was improved and changed to a unified style. However, some citizens were illiterate and could not list the names of a certain party or person at all. Therefore, pictures were used as logos between the parties. (These are still in use today.) These pictures are like the elephants or roosters in the hands of cartoonists. According to a recent survey, the Republican Party's logos are an eagle, the American flag, a portrait of Lincoln on the flag, and a small wooden house. The Democratic Party's logos are a rooster crowing with its neck extended, the Statue of Liberty, an eagle, a donkey, stars, and a hand holding a flag. Many people have expressed opposition, believing that this is simply insulting to voters, asking them to vote for birds and giant elephants.</p>
<p>If voting machines are not used, citizens only complete half of the work after voting. Because after voting, the ballots must be opened, and several people are needed to call out names, record, count, and deal with all the troubles. The number of voters in Boston is one-fifth of that in New York City. Because voting machines are not used, each election requires forty-eight hours of work to obtain the number of votes received by each candidate. In Detroit, with 500,000 voters, each election takes a full day to complete.</p>
<p>Although the election results of small places are not announced, they are often compiled by news agencies, such as the Associated Press, the United Press, the International News Service, and the Pan American Wireless News Agency, and sent to the state capitals or large cities. Larger places will first send the totals to the district election office. After the totals are obtained, they are immediately notified to local newspapers by radio, telegraph, etc. for publication.</p>
<p>In 1940, there was another point in the use of science in elections that had not been seen in previous years, and that was the "television" set, which allowed voters in remote small places to see the real progress of the general election in big cities at any time. This is even more perfect and gratifying than the construction of voting machines.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Top Prize in Elementary School Summer Homework Competition - My Favorite Book <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Daozhong Elementary School Zhu Benhe</p>
<p>The book I love to read the most is "The World's Five Great Leaders." These five great men all came from humble backgrounds but achieved the most glorious positions, which is truly worthy of our admiration, especially our Commander-in-Chief, General Chiang Kai-shek. His life's work has been to strive for the nation and win glory for the country, and finally, he established great achievements, so that future generations can enjoy his favor.</p>
<p>Commander-in-Chief Chiang is from Fenghua County, Zhejiang Province. He had lofty ambitions and a great personality since he was a child, and he was educated by his virtuous mother, laying the foundation for his life's work. At the age of nine, he went to school and studied very hard.</p>
<p>At that time, China was subjected to foreign imperialist aggression and the tyranny of the autocratic government. At this time, the general ambitious young people all held the great ambition of sacrificing for the country, and Mr. Chiang was an enthusiastic patriot. Therefore, he was determined to save the country and the people, joined the military academy, and then studied in Japan, specializing in military science, as the foundation for engaging in revolution. After returning to China, he immediately ran for the revolution, and it was during the Northern Expedition that he established special merits. Wherever he went, the people welcomed him.</p>
<p>In 1936, Commander-in-Chief Chiang was in distress in Xi'an. His indomitable spirit is truly admirable. From this, it can be seen that his fearless spirit is determined that no power in the world can shake his plan to build the country. The Republic of China has today because it is the crystallization of the spirit and doctrine of the Commander-in-Chief. We should trace the past, have full worship, and regard him as our model.</p>
<p>Alas! Since the July 7th Anti-Japanese War, it has been more than three years. All my compatriots should support the supreme leader, be of one heart and one mind, concentrate our strength, and jointly face the national crisis in order to achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Children! Look, the brand-new "New China" is right in front of us!</p>
<h3 id="e108">Airplane Skywriting <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>A pilot flew an airplane into the sky, reaching an altitude of two or three miles, and used white smoke to write a trademark or slogan in the blue sky. He must have superb piloting skills. At the same time, this aircraft must be able to fly freely at high altitude.</p>
<p>To fly an airplane and write in the sky, in terms of equipment, a special fuel tank must be installed in front of the tail, which stores a light paraffin oil. This oil is used to write. Because of the addition of a mysterious chemical substance, the smoke from the written words floats in the sky and can condense together, not immediately disperse. There is also an engine that forcefully sprays the oil into an exhaust pipe. In that exhaust pipe, the heat can turn the oil into thick white smoke. The oil can be infused as needed by the pilot, but he must remember to close the valve each time, and the amount of oil injected can only write 20-foot-long smoke letters.</p>
<p>Before flying, the pilot must first draw a draft of the words or patterns he wants to write in the sky and place it on the dashboard. This word or picture is written in reverse and is seen in a mirror, because what he writes is for the people below to see. When preparing to write in the sky, he ascends to an altitude of 10,000 or 15,000 feet, finds a place where the air sacs will not affect the smoke letters he writes, and then begins to write.</p>
<p>Because the propeller of the aircraft agitates the air and causes it to drift, it will erase the smoke letters that are written, so when the pilot is writing in the sky, he must pay attention not to cross over the place where he has written. Regarding this point, after he writes a stroke, he must sprint upwards, more than 50 feet high, and then write another stroke, and so on until he finishes writing.</p>
<p>Some restricted pilots think that it is not necessary to become the best skywriter. In fact, skywriting is not a dangerous job. The main point is that the weather is clear, and the aircraft used is very special. And the pilot has special skywriting skills, which are more important than bravery. For this reason, among the general pilots, there are not many people who can write in the sky, only a few can be counted. In short, creating skywriting talents is not an easy task. Not to mention China, I am afraid that there are not many in European and American countries.</p>
<h3 id="e109">The Most Suitable Light for Reading <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>Whenever school is over, Yong'er always likes to go outside to play, and although he goes home first, he immediately drops his schoolbag and runs out. His mother always tells him to drink a glass of boiled water, eat some snacks, and sit down for a while, and sometimes asks him to take advantage of the brighter light before the sun goes down to prepare his homework first, and then go out and play to his heart's content. Who knew that Yong'er regarded these words as wind in his ears, and they rarely had any effect, and he still went his own way. When he played until the sun set, when it was about to get dark, he thought about going home. At this time, it was still early before dinner, so he wanted to prepare his homework, but the light at that time was not suitable for working. Even if he wanted to do it, it was very reluctant. He ignored it and started writing, sometimes turning on the light and preparing his homework under the light of the sun and the light of the fire. Unexpectedly, one day he was seen by his father, and he said, "Can you write in such dim light? Why didn't you write just now? Are you planning to wear glasses in the future? And how can you practice good handwriting by writing like this? Don't you have any common sense about light?"</p>
<p>"Dad," I'm not writing anymore. Then, Dad, can you tell me some common sense about light?"</p>
<p>"I'll tell you some. Light can be divided into natural and artificial aspects. Natural light is the light directly emitted by the sun, and artificial light is the light from lamps, candles, and various things that burn. However, this artificial light also comes from sunlight, so the basic source of all light is the sun. Light travels in a straight line, so it is called a light ray. If it travels from air to water, a refraction phenomenon occurs. The color of various things and the fact that we can see various things all require light. Finally, I want to talk about what kind of light is needed for reading so as not to harm our eyes. Before solving this problem, do you know what candlepower means? I don't think you know, so I'll tell you. For example, isn't it engraved on the light bulb that it is 25W? We call it 25 candlepower, which means that a standard candle (which is made of whale wax) burns 7.78 grams in one hour, and the light at this time is called one candlepower. When we read at night, we probably need 50 meter-candles (one meter-candle is the amount of light when a light source of one candlepower can illuminate something at a distance of one meter (three feet)) (which is the most suitable degree of light, that is, one meter away from the light, you need 50 candlepower. During the day, the sunlight is very bright, but the direction it shines from is best from the left, so your desk is placed that way. If it comes from the front, back, or right, it is not very suitable for the eyes. The most important thing to note is that when reading, sunlight must not directly shine on the book, otherwise, you won't see many pages of the book, and your eyes will be dazzled. This is very harmful to you."</p>

<h3 id="e111">Shirley Temple's Autobiography (19) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>After I finished working on a "Bright Eyes" film, I started school. You know where my school is, it is also in this bungalow. I have a white-painted desk, placed by the window in another room, this room is my classroom. But don't think I can be free and do whatever I want, whenever I want to have class, whenever I want to get out of class. My teacher, Miss Buckland, stipulated that class would start at 9:00 AM every morning; she didn't need to call the roll, she only needed to raise her eyes and see that I was sitting at the desk, and that was it. Then she would close the door of the classroom, not allowing anyone to enter until 12:00 PM when I had finished my homework. When I was five years old, I had been to school, so when a lady from the Los Angeles Education Bureau came to test me, she said that my level was already enough for the third or fourth grade of public school.</p>
<p>Dad was still working as a manager in a bank in Los Angeles. Everything at home was not only not getting worse, but was gradually getting better. He once told people that there were now many more people coming to the bank than before, the only reason being that they wanted to see what Shirley Temple's father was like. Later, when they saw that Dad's appearance was not bad, they all came to deposit money. Because the bank's business was booming, Dad's salary also increased greatly, and he was as happy as anything.</p>
<p>Jack was also considering what his future path would be, whether it would be better to be a doctor or an engineer. In my opinion, it is better for him to be a doctor, so that he can hold people's hands and look at his watch. But now he is going to Stanford University to study.</p>
<p>Sheng Nan still doesn't know what he will do in the future, because he is only sixteen years old. He is also studying at a school in New Mexico, wearing the uniform of an army student, which looks very imposing. Every holiday, he always has to come home. Last summer, he came back and said that he planned to run a ranch, riding around on horseback all day long. But before that, he wanted to be a banker like Dad. His idea is constantly changing, so he still can't decide what he will do in the future.</p>
<p>But Jack and Sheng Nan would never want to be movie stars, because they can't sing or dance. Originally, they could each play a role in the "David Copperfield" film. The director had invited them to the photography studio to try out the camera, but as soon as they got the news, they immediately slipped out of the house as if they were running away, without even giving people a chance to say a word to them. They are also proud of my success, but in their eyes, they still see me as a little sister. When we eat together at home, Jack still grabs the biggest piece of cake. If I don't eat quickly, then my piece may be snatched away by him or Sheng Nan. Jack still calls me little sister on weekdays.</p>

<p>— Chen Sen</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) This article strings together over eighty Western film titles to form a cohesive piece. Chen is truly a brilliant film enthusiast, and this ingenious piece is worth a read. We present it here to express our admiration.</p>
<p>A wealthy young man, "Xia Boyang," lives on "Mansion Street" in "Metropolis," a true "Debauched Scoundrel." At the tender age of "Sweet Sixteen," with his "Awakening Passions," he indulges in a life of "Wine, Women, and Song," frequenting "Luxurious and Decadent" establishments, earning him the nickname "Opera House Prodigal Son." He once eloped with "Nina Qi Jia," the "Leading Diva," forming a "Twin Blossom" romance. However, "The Changeability of Love" knows no bounds. Before long, his "Thread of Affection" is focused on the romantic heiress "Little Magnolia." After "One Night of Passion," they secretly "Remarry," spending their "Second Honeymoon" at the "Hollywood Grand Hotel." They become "Flying Wing to Wing," "Embracing Joyfully," seemingly "Destined for Three Lifetimes." Though they swear "Eternal Love," "Until the Seas Run Dry and the Rocks Crumble," they vow to be "United in Life and Death," resembling those "Falling at the Feet of a Beauty." However, during the "Birds Singing and Flowers Blooming" of spring, on a "Quiet Night," he often assumes the persona of a "Wandering Millionaire," frequenting "Erotic Paradises," befriending "Tough Women." Living in an "Affluent Family" during "Youthful Times," in this "Fairytale World," it's no surprise that he enjoys "Boundless Romanticism" and savors "The Essence of Love."</p>
<p>One evening, he accompanies his "Sweetheart," "Leimengna," to the Grand Hotel to watch the utopian drama "The New World After Fifty Years." Its content includes the "Enchanting Women" of the "Fragrant Nation," the "Resurrection" of "Frankenstein," the "Snowfield Battle" between the "Blue Angel" and the "White-Clad Goddess of Mercy," and the "Black Pirate's" "Capture of the King in the Tiger's Den." The dramatic scenes can be described as "Earth-Shattering," while the subtle moments are "Worthy of Song and Tears," all performed on the "Red Carpet." After the "Final Curtain," they go for a night out at the "Seventh Heaven" hotel. At that moment, their chauffeur, nicknamed "Scarface," suddenly reports that "Eighth Wife's" beloved son, "Little Xia Di," has been kidnapped by bandits. The police have dispatched "Emergency Vehicle 99," but to no avail. He rushes home, only to find "The House Empty" and the situation a "Mysterious Case." After a thorough investigation by the "Special Investigation" team, they discover that the bandit is named "The Fox Thief," who twenty years ago was caught by Xia's parents while robbing the Xia family's "Thoroughbred Horse." Xia's father was a "Fearless" "Passionate Man," while Xia's mother was "Greedy for Money." They bravely used "Electronic Surveillance" to capture the thief and imprison him on "Remote Island Prison." Now, both "Old Husband and Wife" have passed away, but the thief's "Twenty Years of Injustice" have never been relieved. He resorts to the path of "Welcoming the God of Wealth," plotting to extort "A Million Dollars" to "Avenge His Wrongs" and achieve his "Desire" for wealth. With the case clear, they invite "Detective Nick" and "Detective Donald" to investigate, believing that "Justice Will Prevail" and "The Criminal Will Meet His End." They are confident that they can "Strike at the Heart of the Enemy," "Uncover the Truth," and "Restore Harmony."</p>
<h3 id="e113">A Glimpse of the Wesley Group Choir <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Keyun</p>
<p>The Moore Church recently established the Wesley Group, modeled after the American system (Wesley is a person's name, the leader of the largest youth organization in the United States, with no fewer than four to five million members nationwide). It is an amateur youth organization dedicated to cultivating noble character, named the Wesley Group. Since its establishment, it has gained four to five thousand members in Shanghai alone. Recently, a choir has been established. Although members are congregants, they must be baptized (limited to those with an understanding of music and religion). The choir has fifty members divided into four parts: female sopranos sing Soprano, female altos sing Altas, male tenors sing Tenor, and male basses sing Base. The simultaneous harmonies create a solemn and respectful atmosphere. The author joined the choir four months ago and believes that it has greatly improved his personal character and inner spiritual cultivation. Moreover, the hymns are noble in their intention and elegant in their language, with profound and intricate pronunciations, far superior to ordinary music in their sincere and moving quality. The choir practices every Friday evening and leads Sunday morning worship. All interested parties are welcome to join, regardless of their understanding of religion, as the appreciation of music and singing is universal. Last Sunday afternoon, the choir performed hymns at the Second Special Prison on Massenet Road and at a hospital to comfort patients, with great success and high praise. The members of the choir are all amateur youths, university students, and advanced students from various schools such as McTyeire School, Ginling College, and the National Conservatory of Music. They share a passion for music and a common goal, hoping to contribute to society in their spare time.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Jin Suqin's Great Compassion <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Haixing</p>
<p>...Wandering Performers Praise Her Endlessly</p>
<p>Jin Suqin's "China Theater Troupe" has returned to Shanghai from Saigon. During this overseas tour, the troupe performed Ouyang Yuqian's reformed Peking operas, such as "Liang Hongyu," "The Peach Blossom Fan," and "The Fisherman's Sorrow." Ticket sales were mediocre, firstly because the overseas Chinese in Vietnam were largely unfamiliar with traditional opera, and secondly, the performances coincided with a period of tension in Vietnam. However, Jin Suqin did a great deed by bringing back a large group of wandering opera performers who had been stranded abroad. Two years ago, Yin Shengtao formed a troupe and went to Annam, but it disbanded due to financial difficulties. Yin Shengtao himself went to Siam, leaving a large number of troupe members stranded overseas, facing hardship. Jin Suqin, moved by compassion, spent money to buy ship tickets and bring them back. The first batch consisted of fifteen people, and the second batch will have more than thirty. Upon arriving in Shanghai, these fellow performers reported to the Performers' Association. The authorities of the Performers' Association praised Jin Suqin's good deed and held a meeting yesterday to welcome them. In the past, the Performers' Association felt that Jin Niang was too new and somewhat out of place, but from now on, they should be able to get along harmoniously.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Thoughts on "Rebirth" <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Tao</p>
<p>"Rebirth" is not simply a human tragedy. The playwright's use of the flashback method (first writing about Di Baoti teaching in America, and then writing about her not being able to stand the students' sarcasm and telling the story of "Rebirth") is not only faithful to the original work, but also shows that although the environment is bad, as long as you can accept everything, and face all the misfortunes frankly, then the victory ultimately belongs to you. It's like after Di Baoti finished telling her story, every student apologized to her and asked her for forgiveness. She had overcome everything after all!</p>
<p>In terms of content, "Rebirth" is indeed a rare masterpiece in recent years. When you hear the voice of the jealous Duchess, "...She ran to America, I followed her to America. She crossed the ocean, I followed her across the ocean. I hate her, I'm jealous of her..." everyone's anger is burning; but when you hear the Duke's voice, "...Wherever you go, I will follow you. You are the only comfort in my soul..." Di Baoti's voice, "...I am guilty, the Duke is not guilty...Although the four children were not born to me, I treat them as if they were my own children, and they all love me..." every audience is deeply moved</p>
<p>Director Anthony Lee Faval's technique is truly memorable. He handles the whole film with both tension and lightness; he grabs the emotions of every audience member, so that the audience has no chance to breathe. The other thing worth mentioning is the coordination of the music, which helps the atmosphere of the whole film a lot.</p>
<p>In terms of individual scenes, the scenes depicting the Duke and Duchess's discord; Reina's illness, with Di Baoti serving him day and night; the Duke and Louise Di Baoti watching the play; the Duke expressing his love for Di Baoti; and finally the Duke killing the Duchess, and the Duke taking poison to commit suicide, are the best and the focus of the whole film!</p>
<p>Charles Boyer plays the Prussian Duke, and Bette Davis plays Di Baoti, which is great! They handle most of the film. Barbara O'Neil plays the Duchess, and her violent and jealous style is commendable. Henry Stevenson plays the teacher Henry, with very few scenes and only competent. Virginia Weidler, who plays the Duke's second daughter Louise, and Richard Nichols, who plays the Duke's fourth son Reina, are two excellent actors.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Shaoxing Amateur Opera United Performance <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Shuren</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Association is one of the three major hometown associations in this city. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the association's establishment. A meeting was held a few days ago to decide to hold a commemorative ceremony today, and Mr. Huang Yuzhai was publicly elected as the director of the preparatory committee, responsible for planning all matters related to the conference. It is heard that in addition to specially inviting celebrities from all walks of life in Shanghai and leaders from the hometown to give speeches, all amateur opera performers from the city's four major amateur opera groups, Yue Sheng, Yue Hua, Yi You, and Qi Yi, were invited to unite for a grand performance. It is also heard that ten famous Yue opera actresses, such as Yao Shuijuan, Li Yanfang, Shi Yinhua, Tu Xinghua, Ma Zhanghua, Yuan Xuefen, Xiao Dangui, Zhang Xiangqing, Zhu Su'e, and Xing Zhuqin, will also join the performance at that time. This large-scale joint performance of famous amateur opera performers and red stars is even grander than the Shaoxing Prefecture Ping Tiao Charity Performance held on August 1st of this year. It is truly a rare opportunity, and the people from Shaoxing Prefecture are in for a treat. It is expected that the association's door on Aierjin Road today will be bustling with traffic and an unprecedented grand occasion.</p>

<p>(9) Borrowing a Red Lantern</p>
<p>The story of the thirteenth prince Lin Fengchun borrowing a red lantern is an episode in the play "Dragon and Phoenix Lock"; it is a very short flirtatious comedy.</p>
<p>A young man on his way asks for a fire from someone on the road because he has no lamp for traveling at night; it so happens that the family has only a young girl. So one is unwilling to lend, and the other insists on borrowing, and "borrowing a lamp" borrows a "romantic encounter."</p>
<p>Compared to Peking opera, the "tea borrowing" performed by the "Debauched Young Man and Evil Girl" in Su opera seems to be more romantic and subtle.</p>
<p>(10) Winter Plum Spinning Flowers</p>
<p>"Spinning Cotton" is a comedy, but "Winter Plum Spinning Flowers" is a tragedy.</p>
<p>Winter Plum is a pitiful girl. Although her husband loves her very much, he is rarely at home; having an evil aunt who is "nitpicking" is not enough. Even more, there is a "partner in crime" younger aunt. Between the two aunts, it is really too difficult to be a daughter-in-law!</p>
<p>When this play is performed, it is a snowy night, and everyone has fallen asleep, but Winter Plum is still spinning flowers in tears under the despotic tyranny of her mother-in-law.</p>
<p>Between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law, in the Chinese family system, most of them seem to never be able to understand each other! In the end, the mother-in-law cannot understand the younger generation, and the daughter-in-law does not know how to respect her elders. Both parties have their own improper points! However, the evil mother-in-law in "Winter Plum Spinning Flowers" is completely unreasonable, and the daughter-in-law is "often blamed for everything." It is no wonder that daughters-in-law want to start a "family revolution."</p>
