<h3 id="c20">平準物價之初步工作 <a href="#c20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>今春以來，百物飛漲之勢。更見披猖，此非物價自然之升降，而出於人為之操縱，實屬無可否認。蓋自物價步漲以來，使人人炫於目前之畸形發展，意外之財，不勞而獲，於是欣欣然惟貨物之囤積是求。投機致富者，更出其盈餘如賽跑然，追逐貨物，不問其為善為惡，但以獲得為事。故棧房儘多存貨，而市上偏少流通。百貨不絕到埠，而物價不絕上升。市面至此，除非彼囤貨居奇者認為投機之機會已過去，傾筐倒篋而出以外，幾無制止之望。</p>
<p>此次租界當局對於一般民生，不能不謂為不在嚴密注視中，即如公共租界工部局又於上星期六（四月十三日）布告主要物品表，令出售者須將貨品價目一併開單揭示於攤上，或店窗等顯明之處；並於貨品上，用標籤揭示其價格；倘遇有壟斷操縱投機及違背此項規則情事，致有所申訴，應備具證據，向捕房提出。就表中各物品以為觀察，似乎華洋食用主要物品，多已列入，苟能照此實行，至低限度之收效，使顧客各得就其所定價格，購其所願購之貨物。其間未見限令辦理者，即各種物品之品質，並無明白釐定；倘若將來根據標價，進而釐訂公定價格，難保不以次貨售上價，尤如魚肉蔬菜之售價，不僅為品質高低，即貨物之鮮宿，售價亦立分高下。至應標價之物品，既採用列舉方法，一一開示，則不在列舉之中者，勢將不受本規則之拘束。或謂主要物品表所列之物品，按之西人食用，可云應有盡有；即標價辦法，行之於與西人交易之牛羊肉莊及糖果食物雜貨舖，亦尙利便；若求之於華人，則以所列舉物品之範圍未免過狹，且行之於菜攤肩販及油酒烟紙魚肉店舖，恐不易得到所期之效果。即如牛羊猪肉，表中僅列舉某某等數部分之肉，又如菜蔬中之豆，只註明為法國產，是否除此各部分及法國豆以外，其他可不必標價矣。若此解釋為不誤，未免所漏良多。以言取締操縱囤積，令顧客提具證據，求之於法理，固屬應爾。衡之於事實，則諸多窒礙。何况投機操縱，都為巨商大賈，彼轉運販賣之貨商，實際上不但不能操縱居奇，至多亦不過要索善價而已！</p>
<p>竊以為工部局如為上海整個民生着想，則應除貨品標價以外，求更廣大之辦法，以適應非常時期公衆之需要。亦明知處此種局勢之下，欲以工部局之權力，解決一般民生之困難，事實有所不可能。然除工部局以外，上海人士又將何所蘄求乎？則唯一之希望，仍唯希望工部局多肩此責任耳！</p>
<p>現在虹口警權問題已解決，工部局為裨補民生而作之努力，易得各方之贊助，而工部局之命令，今後當可推行於租界之全部，不問其為東西南北之區也。蓋今日物價之大患，為囤積居奇；抑囤積者必有其所囤之處，而居奇者必有其可居之道。惟囤積所以敢於無所顧忌，正為其狡兎三窟，不藏於此，可藏於彼，是以在警權統一之後，既得無虞於掣肘，則調查易於進行，取締易於收效。誠使更進一步，擇日用必需之主要品，不論公私行棧所堆儲者。務令其將貨主物品種類等級嘜頭及進本數量，一一登記，不收費用，辦理手續，一唯商人之便利是圖，復於必要時，得令提出提單棧單之屬以資證明。其各廠所存儲者亦應報告，彙總而統計之，以測一地貨物之盈朒。有以為登記棧存各貨，豈可平準物價，徒為工部局平添許多工作而已；但須知囤積，正利用存貨之不公開，混水撈魚，暢所欲為。及存貨一一登記，不使隱匿，雖未嘗干涉其行動，而彼已心存顧忌，有不敢過分居奇矣。凡事豫則立，不豫則廢，此亦平準物價必循之途徑；可與物品標價並行不悖，而亦相得益彰者也。</p>

<p>原料飛漲</p>
<p>及最近職員薪金之增加等、英商公共汽車公司雖不能恢復其蘇州河北區之營業、但自一九三七年以來、其營業狀况、較諸往普、有過之無不及、如工部局有减低物價以維持居民之生計之一贓　、而欲使租界居民能瞭解工部局確已從事某種</p>

<p>負担過重之一途而已、但工部局決不能將公共汽車據爲公有、應以爲　衆利益為營業目標、吾人建議、惟有取消其專利權、而尤準其他公共汽車公司之設立、在競爭狀態下、或　有補一二也、</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛脾、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、情况頗形乎庸、一以投機未見熱烈、二因環境無新刺激、經營者舉步甚穩、故祇多套利交易、晨初以匯兌回長少許、開後美匯遂吿六元、英金則未更動、嗣因外行賣意　佳、市面仍鬆、後華商與外行做開麥利交易、午刻投機商扒意突起、價即綏緩走軟、午後市象呆滯、少人注意、遠期美滙、價亦獨軟、現貨與五月期竟差二角半至二八一二五、擁有現鈔者四起活動、紛來貼進、（四十日計算）達月息四分以上、</p>

<p>五月美匯獨緊</p>
<p>午後初開爲狀殊形平穩、極少交易做開，僅聞投機商曾扒進五月份美滙價爲五元六五六二五、此外祗外行對做、計五月份美匯亦爲五元六五六二五、但五月份美匯時見微緊、迄至晚收毫無變動、結果現貨英金吿四辦士一二五、美匯六元、四月份英金四辦士〇四六八七五、美匯五元八七五、五月份英金三辦士八九〇六二五、美匯五元六二五、較之隔昨晚收、現貨英金不動、美匯鬆〇二一二五、四月份英金長〇一五六二五、美匯未更、而五月份英金亦硬〇一五六二五、美匯反軋軟〇三一二五、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、走勢不穩、上落靡定、範圍尚小、蓋滙市報鬆、及環境無利多方、價時有撳低可能、但人心振奮、、買風易起、價亦不難提高、晨初以外匯微現鬆硬、兼經營者坐視、致開盤即小二十七元爲五千八百元、後雖漲起二十餘元、但銀號等突入兜售、雖吸進有戶、頭寸仍感寬裕、卒跌進八百元關內見五千七百七十五元全日低價、嗣賴金號證劵帮購買、午收已站關外、午後匯市亦穩、人心殊佳、開後即躍達五千八百三十元、霎時間曾吿跌十餘元、終因證劵帮搜購不遺餘力、續升達五千八百四十元、奈頃刻某證券帮復吐、而錢兌業斯時亦塞出不少、遂降至五千八百〇五元、迨收盤結果吿五千八百〇六元、較上日軋跌二十一元、全天交易寥落、約計三千兩有餘、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平，</p>

<p>飾金掛小五元</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百九十元、迨至九時三刻掛小五元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸五百八十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>

<p>昨日外幣又疲、交易减少不少、其癥結當在外股在漲、一般套出外滙外稱、掉進外股者頗不乏人、昨市英美金鎊略軟、美金票起落不定、大勢盤旋於十六元六角一分及十六元五角五分之間、晚市最低價、比上日軋小六分、法郞票軟弱、香港票供求尚平、斐律濱票萎頓、惟英金票仍有需要、市價挺漲、日鮮票依然疲弱、前者續降爲一元三角零五厘、後者精降至一元零三分五厘、餘尚穩定、</p>

<p>洋米期貨因國外定價、昨逐電報漲、五月期一號西貢須六十三元、故行號手貨均圖堅守不出、而北帮與大戶吸收已多、仍圖添進、投機興奮不衰、晨間開市價立見買氣之旺、二號西貢四五月份開價即至五十四元四角、比前日下午收價五十四元已漲四角、午刻一度被浮戶出籠撳小至五十四元、但至午後收市　被大戶抬高至五十四元四角半、全日期貨開出三百五十噸、現洋米八千包、</p>

<p>昨有一寗波人，年約三十餘歲，似洋行細崽模樣，在本埠西北法華相近之志遠浜地方高墩上，手持千里鏡，仰天對照，口則自言自語曰：「天宮之奇，真世所罕見！」俄而又言曰：「周遇吉老爺騎馬持長槍出南天門了。」鄉間老幼男女聞其言，皆蜂擁圍觀。有老者問此鏡之名目，並願乞借一觀。寗人曰：「此名照天千里鏡，能看上天景象，今非吝借，無如此鏡價値千金，我隨東家來鄉打鳥，船停在此不遠，茲因東家在船飲酒，故暫偷　片刻，如借君看，倘有不測，誰任其咎。」鄉人謂自當格外小心，決不有悮。寗人始尤諾，鄕老翻覆細視，總覺糢糊不明。寗人吿以看有看法，若不按法，宜熟視而若無覩也。隨令依法詳看，彼此接遞，故意脫手墜地。寗人遂號咷大哭，拉住鄕人不放，在後從地上拾起細視，又轉悲作喜曰：「幸無大碍，祇碎顯微鏡一塊，尙可到上海修理，然亦需銀二十元也。」再四相商，讓至十二元寢事云。</p>
<p>蟒不傷人</p>
<p>蘇垣黃山某甲入山採樵，聞谷中有鼾息如雷，伏而探之，則一巨蟒，蟠踞　間，首如栲栳，眼若閃電，某素有膽力，投石擊之，蟒不動，某更欲取鐮同斫，不覺失足，身撲於蟒，自問必為所害，即亦不懼；惟回顧高岡，不能上昇，乃緣蛇身攀藤而出，始慶更生也。</p>

<p>— 新良</p>
<p>戰時的柏林，究竟是怎樣的一副面目呀？</p>
<p>回為我們住的是一家很好的旅館，當然啦，我們是無從知道一般德人的情況的。在這里，我們仍可以得到最好的食品，像魚呀，蛋呀，這些東西。即使是在沒肉吃的日子上，我們也可以　到。在後面，就請諸位拿戰前柏林的情況來比一比吧。</p>
<p>很抱歉，在進早餐時，旣沒有葡萄汁，也沒有橘子水，所有的，就只是一只不很好的蘋果而已。</p>
<p>我曾問過旅館里的侍者，他們的境況如何？他告訴我：工資只有一九三二年時的一半，但他覺得很欣慰，因為他能夠保有這個職位，但大多數他的朋友，連這樣倘起碼的位置，還不容易找到呢。</p>
<p>如今，讓我們上街上去看看吧。我們看到一張張很大的招貼。據說，這些東西，每星期要調換一次，大都是將張伯倫描成個戰神的樣子；新聞界卻喜歡攻擊邱吉爾。</p>
<p>在沿街的大櫥窗里，我們仍可以看到很漂亮的依賴，襯衫，皮手套等等。你也可以隨意購買這些東西。但第一你先得將你的「購貨紀錄卡」呈騐。每個住在柏林的居民都有這樣一張卡片，上面印有一百個小點，使用期間限定一年。某次，我有一個朋友，一口氣買了一件新衣，兩條領帶，兩件襯衫，與兩雙襪子，竟使他用去了八十小點，在這一年中，只勝二十點可以購買到別的東西了。你在買新衣服時，還得將舊衣交還哩。</p>
<p>在馬路上，你也常常可發現，有許多穿着淡藍色制服的人物，他們就是柏林四周圍的防空部隊，在柏林，穿綠色或灰色制服的德國陸軍，倒不大看見。又有一般穿着深藍色服裝的人，那大半都是勞工陣線的衛兵。在街上駛過的汽車，統統都被塗成了像兵艦樣的灰顏色，它們如今都是屬於軍隊里的了。</p>
<p>現在我們到阿特隆鎮來進午餐了。不幸得很，今天適巧是逢到沒肉吃的日子，這種日子每星期共有二次，但是在阿特隆你卻照樣仍舊可以有炙山芋片打成的菓醬蛋糕吃到，要是你在一家普通德人家去吃的話，那每星期，你只能嚐一個雞蛋——吃一條魚，也是極不容易的。</p>
<p>吃成這頓飯，當然是相當貴的，那個蛋糕，外加一塊巧格力餅（除了阿特隆外，你是無論如何吃不到這樣東西的），一瓶蘋果汁酒，共計花去了六馬克又五十分尼。</p>
<p>很遺憾地，在下午我們不能上該地最大的一家咖啡店里去一遊，據說，每天在那里都擁滿了人羣——中下級的婦女尤多。</p>
<p>晚間我們就在一家私人俱樂部里進晚餐，那里小菜相當好，但價錢也并不算便宜。</p>
<p>戰時的柏林，究竟是怎樣的一副面目？我們跑了一天之後，大略是可以知道一些了。（節譯自　The　Christian　Science　Monitor）</p>

<p>— 鈕錚</p>
<p>春偷偷地來，不久，又要偷偷地歸去。正和自己愛惜自己殘遺的青春一樣，對於這佳麗的春，有着回憶憧憬。黃金的童年，在我的生活史上，已再不能寫出優美的篇幅，由它去吧！無情的歲月，可又奪去寶貴的青春？</p>
<p>在日中，或夜半，也會想起那遼闊的原野，一泛清溪，垂楊柳下的漁翁，還有慈祥的笑臉嗎？已春色滿園的時候了，禁不住遙向白雲的深處，探問故鄉一年一度紅杏的消息，桃花瓣淖入泥汚，還有人在憐惜嗎？蛛子的綱，會不會掛滿樑間？</p>
<p>托春風寄語，故鄉，我深深地憶戀着你，昔日的安康，舊時的風光，該被蹂躪盡了吧！為什麼，帶來的消息，又刺痛了旅人的心呢？</p>
<p>但是，被烈士的血滲透了的地土，該是最肥美的，革命的花朶，又將開得多麼光明燦爛。</p>
<p>我瞭望着，在故鄉的地土上，快會生長出一樣光榮的花朶！</p>

<p>就大多數的人說，這些日子，是黑暗而艱苦的日子。人生是一種艱苦事，須要我們用所有精力，創造力，和忍耐力去幹。在現今的時代做人不是容易或簡單的事。許多的人，為生計這樣忙迫，他們少有或沒有工夫，來修養他們的靈性，為麵包，為人生必需品而起的日常奮鬥，要求人的偉大勇敢和努力。就較大的社會情形，和國際，這種的奮鬥是更鮮明，經濟失失敗，成了人們負不起的重担。世界上有些地方，生命的必需品踏踐了，而有些地方又餓死人。國際間日見疏離，互相猜忌之心日重，大家競爭軍備，認軍備為和平的惟一保障，這表明世界上，已充滿着懼怕和疑惑。就個人的重整旗鼓和經騐說，這些都是黑暗而艱苦的日子。將來怎樣，就是極有自信的先知，也不敢預言。自有歷史以來，要算今日極需要偉人，強人，和能人。我們所要的人，是意志堅強，不是殘忍野蠻，是富有同情心，不是感情用事，換言之，就是我們所需要的人，是耶酥基督所訓練成的那種，宗敎的主要任務，是在人與造物主之間，培養成這樣一種關係，使最優美的人格，得以產生。拿　勒的耶酥，曾為此種工作，獻上他的生命，做了實騐，來證明之。雖則世人對他做許多不近人情而足使他對人失卻信任心的事，他仍舊敢於信任人。人們譏笑他，鞭打他，用最辱人而只為罪惡極的人適用的方法，將他處死，但是他仍相信人，相信他們有潛伏着的才能。這　就是因為他按照一種新奇標準度量人。一個人不當看他以往是怎樣，也沒可看他現在是怎樣。乃要看他將來可能的成就。（待續）如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3 id="c106">「助讀」家庭敎師自述 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 競爭</p>
<p>雖說現在我是獲得了一處家庭教師的職務，但，這並不足以使人羨慕，因為只十幾元一月的這碗飯，是費了九牛二虎之力——或者是說，用盡了「煩神」「拜託」「謝謝」的詞彙而換得的。而且，在已經拿到了這飯碗之後的如今，開始感到「吃」的并不容易了！</p>
<p>這位被我所敎的學生是初中三年級程度而行將畢業的。他——這位「老爺」（為了他的「老太爺」「老太太」都已赴另一世界，家裏由他們兄弟支持着，僕役們便這樣地稱呼他們的主人）是養尊處優慣了的，進學堂只是掛個名，平素讀書，不是遲到，便是缺課，大約因為幾年來爛汚撒得太不成樣了，而畢業時校中功課較忙，一時不易對付，為了這，於是成全了我這個位置。</p>
<p>補起書，到今天也將近一個月囉！可是在這短短的兩個鐘頭中，我從沒有見過他沒有打瞌睡。每夜，總是在我到後的十分鐘模樣，才懶洋洋地拿了書來（他「府中」的夜飯「用」的很遲哩！）沒有到九點鐘，我還在指着書一項項解釋，他卻目不看書，倒是「顧左右而視他」起來：開始漸漸地打呵欠。眼光更不時地去看鐘，似乎在想着「分針為什麼走得這樣慢？」</p>
<p>學校裏每天指定要做的題目非常多，幾何啦，代數啦，三角啦……這位「莫明其妙」的每天非溜冰，看戲不可的「老爺」怎麼辦呢？當然，憑他的「聰明」，一想就想出「妙計」來了。可是，這妙計卻苦了我。</p>
<p>大約他是這樣想的：與其每天聽我教一遍，仍舊解不出題目；還不如一乾二凈，所有題目就由我代做了吧！反正出了錢呢！</p>
<p>開始，——他實行這「妙計」的開始，他還由我解答在草稿紙上，再自己抄上練習簿；後來，他大槪是有『經騐』而『改良』了，素性將題目交給我，直接要我膡在簿子上。自己呢，不是今天說『有事請假』，便是明天說『有朋友請客』，十天倒有個五六天不來坐這兩個『坐牢』鐘點了！</p>
<p>我先前還教得有點興趣，現在是不特索然寡味，簡直是回到初中時代了去了，簡直等於是做初中三的學生了！援用大學教授的『助敎』這名詞，我便可稱為這位『老爺』的『助讀』。</p>
<p>這種家庭教師，我實在覺得沒有再繼續下去的可能性了，嗚呼，這種『學生』，實在不敢領教！——我不能為了這幾個大錢，去為一個不上進的人服務！</p>

<h3 id="c107">時間 <a href="#c107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— 省三</p>
<p>時間一切事物的原料，有了它，甚麼都能解決，沒有它，一切終成枉然。時間比金錢寶貴得多。倘然你有了時間，往往由此得着金錢，否則，你雖然是百萬富翁，卻不能花錢比我或比躺在火爐旁邊的貓多買得一分鐘。</p>
<p>最令人驚異的事，是每天早晨一覺醒來，啊！你口袋中已很神秘的滿載着你生命的宇宙內尚未製造的二十四小時。這是你的，這是你所有物中最珍貴的財富！因為，你看！沒有人能把它從你那裏竊去。那是不能偷的，那是上天早公尤的派給世界上每一個人，每個人所得的，也不會比你多，也不會比你少，而且同樣是源源不絕的供給着。</p>
<p>但是時間的供給，雖然非常有規則，卻也非常苛刻的，你看！昨天去後，今天也永遠消滅了，決不會再來一個一般的昨天與今天，待明天成為今天的時候，也是今天永遠消滅的時候，知道嗎？這是時間的特性啊！</p>
<p>那豈不是令人非常悲哀·苦悶·和沮喪嗎？的確，如你不把收入的二十四小時有計劃的利用，那末，無疑的你的一生必然在糊塗中葬送了。但是你該相信，上天給我們二十四小時，已是非常足夠了。這連續不斷的二十四小時，我們什麼事不可以辦呢？我們可以增進我們的學識；鼓勵我們的品行；奠定我們的生活基礎；我們可以肅清目前的障礙與疑難：我們能夠創造的環境；建設遠大的前程！我們不需要更多的時間了，最大的關鍵，能不能將我們日常時間的消費，加以精細的審察。</p>

<p>—英國新片　先運西線</p>
<p>英國現以最新的影片，運往西線，以娛軍隊，而倫敦人士卻引頸以待這些影片從西線運回本國才能一飽眼福。流動電影隊三隊已從英國前往法國，將以所　影片在最前線放映，供士兵消遣。因為今日的陸軍都乘車調動，所以放映機和影片，都用車載着到處開映，英國各大影片公司竭其所能，與當局合作供給最精彩的影片，給駐法的英國遠征軍消遣。</p>
<p>有些最新攝成的影片，還沒有在倫敦大電影院公映，便已運到法國，放映給軍隊觀看，所蒐集的各種影片已經渡海峽運法，另有許多影片將絡繹運送。也許有這末一天，倫敦的主要影評家將乘飛機到法國西北部某個軍事根據地的兵營中，參加新片在歐第一次公映；或許還將在英軍所守馬奇諾防線的地面下一百呎處，跟英兵雜坐着觀新片「乘風而去」呢</p>
<p>除了影片以外，並有旅行舞臺劇表演，目的是在使士兵，得到娛樂。這種舞臺劇表演在上次大戰時，極受士兵歡迎，志願演員組成的團體，已在倫敦排演戲劇和各種游藝，有的已往法國表演，供軍人欣賞。二十餘年前曾去法國表演戲劇以娛士兵的傑克白卻南等人，正在計劃着再度率領劇團，赴法國前線表演。</p>

<p>— 小田</p>
<p>講個笑話，「從前有一個人，生前諸惡不作，眾善奉行，死後來到陰間，閻王打開功過簿一看，記功簿上，寫得密密層層，記過簿上，竟是不見點墨，陰間還不曾有過這種先例，那閻王只得請他自己說個投生去處，那人不慌不忙，念出一首詩來，閻王一聽，連忙下位向他躬身下拜，說道：「若有這樣的好去處，還是請你來做一任閻羅王，讓我也去快活快活」，你道那詩怎麼說，寫在下面——</p>
<p>繞屋千頃靠山田，廣有亭臺花果園，庫積金銀倉積栗，陸行車馬水行船，嬌妻美妾房房有，桂子嗣孫個個賢，官不管來民不擾，壽比彭祖一千年。</p>
<p>當我講完了這段笑話的時候，座中有幾個朋友齊聲說道：「我們覺得這麼着，還沒有得娶陳曼麗來得快活。」這是曼麗遇害前一天的話。古人云：「生不願封萬戶候，但願一　韓荊州，」陳曼麗的魔力，畢竟比韓荊州還大哩。」</p>
<p>「一個人總要安分守己，陳曼麗在我們舞女界中，也總算封王了，她要能安安分分幹她的本行，也不至於遇着這種飛來橫禍，真個是自作孽，不可活。」這是曼麗死後我第一次聽到的話，說的人，無疑也是位紅星了。</p>
<p>有一次遇着個常和曼麗伴舞的友人，他告訴我曼麗遇害的那天，他也在塲，手摸着傷口還能講話，可算死得慘極了。我問他你有什麼感想呢？他說：「死了就換個別人跳一跳罷了，反正舞女是死不完的」。這倒是個達觀者。</p>
<p>一位客人說：「陳曼麗的肌膚，白凈瑩澈，渾身找不出絲毫斑點，現在再要想找這麼個人，真就難了。」這口氣很像是位入幕之賓，不然，怎會檢查得這樣細到呢？」又一位客人說：「又美麗，又聰明，態度又大方，應酬又周到，又肯用心學球藝，像陳曼麗這種多才多藝美艷大方的人，要老天爺再製造一個出來，卻還不容易呢。不過她死的歲數，倒要說是相當，不然，像賽金花那樣，讓人家只留着個老婆子的影像在腦海裏，覺得多麼乏味呢。」這到也是一部份理由</p>
<p>盡說別人的意見，主說我的了，本來，色即是空，空即是色，佛家所說色字的解釋，是觸封　壞，可見能觸能封的東西，終是要變要壞的，講到這裏，也沒法再往下說了，只得合掌呢喃，善哉善哉了。</p>

<p>Shaanzhou, the 18th. At dawn, the Chinese army, with careful deployment, took advantage of the weakness and attacked Hengshui Town (east of Wenxi). The Japanese were caught off guard and suffered heavy casualties. The Chinese army repeatedly charged and killed until noon, when the remaining Japanese fled in defeat. The Chinese then recovered Hengshui Town. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan. The Chinese army in central Shanxi has been extremely active recently. On the night of the 10th, a certain unit of the Chinese army strongly attacked Fenyang. The Japanese were caught off guard and a unit of the Chinese army charged into the city, burning down four Japanese ammunition depots and several food storage locations. They also killed more than 120 Japanese soldiers and destroyed more than 330 boxes of Japanese ammunition and a large amount of food. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yunshan. The Japanese army in southeastern Shanxi has recently been acting recklessly again.

<h3 id="e20">Preliminary Work to Stabilize Prices <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Since this spring, the trend of soaring prices for all goods has become even more rampant. It is undeniable that this is not a natural rise and fall of prices, but a result of artificial manipulation. Since the price increase began, it has made everyone dazzled by the abnormal development and unexpected wealth currently available, obtained without labor. Therefore, everyone is happily seeking to hoard goods. Speculators are using their surplus funds like racers, chasing goods, not caring whether they are good or bad, but only seeking to obtain them. Therefore, warehouses are full of inventory, but there is little circulation in the market. Hundreds of goods arrive at the port continuously, but prices rise continuously. If the market continues like this, unless those who hoard goods for speculation believe that the opportunity for speculation has passed and dump their goods out of their baskets and crates, there is little hope of stopping it.</p>
<p>This time, the concession authorities cannot be said to be neglecting the general livelihood of the people. For example, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession issued a notice last Saturday (April 13) regarding a table of essential goods, ordering sellers to post the price of the goods on the stall or shop window in a prominent place; and to indicate the price on the goods with a label. If there is any situation of monopoly, manipulation, speculation, or violation of this rule, resulting in a complaint, evidence should be prepared and submitted to the police. Observing the various items in the table, it seems that most of the essential goods for both Chinese and foreigners have been included. If this can be implemented, the minimum effect will be to allow customers to purchase the goods they want at the prices they have set. What has not been seen limited in the handling of this matter is the quality of various goods, which has not been clearly defined. If, in the future, based on the marked prices, a fixed price is further defined, it is difficult to guarantee that inferior goods will not be sold at a high price, just like the price of fish, meat and vegetables, which depends not only on the quality, but also on the freshness, with the price varying accordingly. Since the items to be priced are listed one by one using the enumeration method, those not listed will not be bound by this rule. Some say that the items listed in the table of essential goods can be said to include everything that Westerners eat; and the pricing method is convenient for Westerners trading in beef and mutton shops and candy food grocery stores. However, for Chinese people, the scope of the listed items is too narrow, and it may not be easy to achieve the desired effect when applied to vegetable stalls, shoulder vendors, and oil, wine, cigarette and paper, fish and meat stores. For example, for beef, mutton and pork, the table only lists certain parts of the meat. For vegetables, only French beans are specified. Does this mean that other parts and French beans do not need to be priced? If this interpretation is not wrong, there are many omissions. As for cracking down on manipulation and hoarding, requiring customers to provide evidence is, of course, appropriate in terms of legal principles. However, in reality, there are many obstacles. Moreover, speculation and manipulation are all done by big merchants and wealthy businessmen. Those who transport and sell goods actually cannot manipulate and hoard, and at most only ask for a good price!</p>
<p>We believe that if the Municipal Council is thinking about the overall livelihood of Shanghai, it should seek a broader method in addition to pricing goods, to meet the needs of the public in this extraordinary period. It is also clear that in this kind of situation, it is impossible to solve the difficulties of the general livelihood of the people with the power of the Municipal Council. But apart from the Municipal Council, what can the people of Shanghai expect? The only hope is still to hope that the Municipal Council will shoulder more of this responsibility!</p>
<p>Now that the Hongkou police power issue has been resolved, the efforts made by the Municipal Council to benefit the people's livelihood will easily gain the support of all parties, and the orders of the Municipal Council can now be implemented in all parts of the concession, regardless of whether it is east, west, north, or south. The biggest problem with today's prices is hoarding for speculation; and those who hoard must have a place to hoard, and those who speculate must have a way to speculate. The reason why hoarding dares to be so unscrupulous is precisely because they are like cunning rabbits with three burrows, not hiding here, but hiding there. Therefore, after the unification of police power, since there is no fear of being held back, investigation is easier to carry out, and cracking down is easier to achieve results. If we go one step further, we should select the essential daily necessities, regardless of whether they are stored in public or private stores. They must be required to register the owner of the goods, the type, grade, mark, and quantity of the goods one by one, without charging fees, and the procedures should be handled solely for the convenience of the merchants. When necessary, they may be ordered to submit the bill of lading and warehouse receipt to prove it. The inventory stored by each factory should also be reported, compiled and statistically analyzed to measure the abundance of goods in a place. Some believe that registering the goods stored in the warehouses cannot stabilize prices, but only adds a lot of work to the Municipal Council; but it must be known that hoarding is precisely taking advantage of the non-public nature of inventory, muddying the waters to fish, and doing whatever they want. When inventory is registered one by one, without allowing concealment, although their actions have not been interfered with, they are already wary and dare not speculate excessively. Everything is established in advance, and fails without preparation. This is also the path that must be followed to stabilize prices; it can be done in parallel with pricing goods, and can also complement each other.</p>

<p>Washington – The United States' emphasis on maintaining the status quo in the Pacific is becoming increasingly apparent. Developments in the past 24 hours have been sufficient to draw attention to the highly secretive naval maneuvers the US is conducting west of Hawaii. It is widely believed that the location of this US naval exercise is closer to the US coast than before, and the exclusion of journalists and photographers from the exercise is also unprecedented. Furthermore, the US Secretary of the Navy personally traveling far from home to review the maneuvers is an even more unusual measure. According to well-informed sources, with the commercial treaty dispute having safely passed through Congress, Secretary of State Hull can now concentrate his full attention on events in the Far East. The proposal for the US Navy's budget of $964,000,000, starting from July 1st of this fiscal year, has now been passed by the Senate and sent back to the House for approval of non-essential amendments. It is noted that this bill includes funding for the construction of two new battleships, each up to 50,000 tons. It is also noted that there are already eight other US battleships under construction. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Map of the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Washington – The Senate yesterday passed the amended naval budget for the next fiscal year, which will soon be transferred to the House of Representatives. It is generally believed that it will not cause significant difficulties in the House. According to this bill, in the coming year, the government will, in addition to continuing the completion of eight battleships, seven cruisers, two aircraft carriers, forty destroyers, twenty submarines, and many other auxiliary vessels already under construction, also commence construction of two new battleships, one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, eight destroyers, six submarines, and many other small warships. Although the official tonnage of these two battleships has not been announced, it is generally believed that they will be 50,000-ton dreadnoughts. Political figures have also stated that the Senate's passage of the naval budget with an overwhelming majority vote is entirely in line with the national desire to increase naval strength so that it can respond to Japan's expansion of power into the South Pacific in the future. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington – US Naval Chief of Staff Admiral Stark stated yesterday at the Senate Naval Committee that Japan may have recently built twelve "super-battleships." He re-submitted the funding request to fortify Guam, located 1,200 miles south of Yokohama. Admiral Stark said that Japan may complete four "super-battleships" within this year, and will build another two to four by 1944. Although he expressed doubt about Japan currently building as many as twelve of these "super-battleships," the Navy Department has received this report. He believes that the Navy Department should be allowed to establish a strong air force and submarine base in Guam to serve as an advance scouting post for the fleet. The Navy Department does not intend to establish a major naval base in Guam, "but only wants to establish an air force and submarine base, and a garrison sufficient to consume any potential enemy's ability to invade Guam. At the same time, in the event of war with any power, the island is a key point on the route to the East Indies, China, and Japan. The commercial interests in this area can be maintained for hundreds of years or more." Stark requested that the committee declare to the public that if Guam is not fortified as requested by the Navy, this decision would be a matter of funding and "not because of external defense." Admiral Stark meant that the Navy Department's efforts to avoid opposition from Japan regarding the fortification of Guam have influenced the opinions of the US Congress. "Proper fortification of Guam is sufficient to protect our West Coast, and there are many foreign territories in the Pacific that are beneficial to our country, but unfortunately, we do not own these key points. Therefore, we should make better use of what we do own, namely Guam, Midway Island, Hawaii, and other islands. The fortification of these islands is a very wise move and is done to protect our national interests." Stark added that the establishment of a naval base in Guam, regardless of its size, would be sufficient to consolidate our political position in the Far East. The Navy Department's attitude towards the fortification of Guam is not limited to the issue of protecting the Philippines alone. Regardless of whether the Philippines is independent or not, the base in Guam can guarantee the navy's most favorable position for operations in the Western Pacific, and the defense of Hawaii will also be greatly facilitated. If a major war breaks out in the Atlantic, the navy's two-front combat capabilities would also be guaranteed." Senator Tydings supported Admiral Stark's request for the Navy Department to increase its funding by 25%. Tydings is a member of the Naval Committee and the Insular Affairs Committee, which holds a crucial position in the budget for the development of Guam.</p>
<p>Washington – The United States Senate yesterday passed the naval appropriations bill with 63 votes to 4, totaling $963,797,478. The bill stipulates the construction of two new superbattleships, each of 45,000 tons, dozens of small-scale warships, and 352 naval aircraft, as well as maintaining a naval force of 150,000 and a Marine Corps of 25,000. The naval appropriations bill was passed by a majority in the House of Representatives, and after four hours of debate in the Senate, it was also passed and sent to President Roosevelt for signing. The bill provides $410,183,400 for the purchase of new aircraft, including $5,000,000 for the equipment of the new aircraft carrier "Hornet," which can carry 119 aircraft. In addition, the bill allows the Navy Department to sign contracts worth $25,000,000 for the purchase of new fighter jets. (Taichung Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington – President Roosevelt stated last night that Secretary of State Hull's communication is sufficient to indicate the country's concern for the situation in the Far East. He said that for the sake of peace, the United States needs to maintain the status quo throughout the Pacific. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull's statement not to disturb the status quo of the Dutch East Indies has resonated throughout the country. Many feel that no pronouncements from American officials in recent years have received such unanimous national approval. Newspaper headlines mostly read, "America Will Not Allow Japan to Interfere in the Dutch East Indies" and "Hull Warns Japan Not to Disturb the Dutch East Indies." The Baltimore Sun stated that the United States should remain apart from European conflicts, but it would be absurd to say that the United States is not concerned with maintaining the supply of important commodities such as rubber and tin. Even if the United States intends to isolate itself, it cannot isolate itself from rubber, and therefore, the facts are unfavorable to isolation. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington – After Secretary of State Hull issued a statement yesterday explaining the US position on the Dutch East Indies issue, members of both the House and Senate expressed their approval, believing that the US government, under pressure from the European situation, will gradually implement the following policies: (1) Efforts will be made to limit Germany's temporary control over neutral European countries, ensuring that the country's expansion of power does not extend beyond the borders of Europe. (2) Efforts will be made to relieve Britain and France's concerns about maintaining order in the Pacific. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Washington – Diplomatic figures here have commented on Secretary of State Hull's statement yesterday regarding the US attitude on the Dutch East Indies issue, saying that the gist of this statement is twofold: first, to respond to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's remarks, informing them that if Japan attempts to control the Dutch East Indies, under no circumstances will it be tolerated by the United States; second, to warn Germany that if it intends to "protect" the Netherlands, as it did with Denmark, the US government will not tolerate the status of the Dutch East Indies being affected by it. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Pittman Advocates Firm Action: Apply Economic Pressure to Japan</p>
<p>Reno – The chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Pittman, stated last night that the US response to Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies should be to implement immediate and decisive economic pressure to restrain Japan. "We hope that Japan will be governed by reason and will not force the United States to impose economic pressure on Japan. The United States only needs to implement economic pressure to stop Japan's actions." Pittman continued, "Secretary of State Hull's communication in Washington is a clear communication explaining US policy. Although it is very firm, it cannot be regarded as containing an offensive nature." It is generally recalled that Hull's communication, supported by President Roosevelt, warned Japan that the United States would oppose any changes to the status quo of the Dutch East Indies.

<p>Luleå, Sweden – News last night reported that more British troops landed both south and north of Bodo, 100 miles south of Narvik. It is reported that British troops have occupied Loding Village at the foot of the Salten Fjord, the Lofoten Islands, and the city of Valvik north of Bodo, and are now beginning to encircle Bodo. It is also reported that British troops landed midway between Trondheim and Bodo to prepare to use this place as a base for attacking Trondheim and capturing the railway between Trondheim and Storlien.

<p>Capital of Sweden – News just received here indicates that the battle situation on the Trondheim front in Norway is favorable to the Norwegian army. The fact that British and French troops have made contact with the Norwegian army there has also been confirmed. The German side is rushing to build defenses near the port and is conscripting Norwegian citizens aged sixteen to fifty to participate in the work. Because the Trondheim airport is inconvenient for landing due to melting snow, it is very difficult for the German army to use aircraft to transport soldiers and ammunition, so it is necessary to have solid defenses. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Paris – Well-informed sources here recently stated that the war in Norway is still in the mobilization phase, and a large-scale war has not yet begun. Therefore, the allied countries are consulting on what intentions they have in northern Norway, how many troops they are sending to Norway, and where they are landing. The Allied Command is keeping it all secret, only saying that the landing site will be determined at the discretion of the commander of the expeditionary force. As for the situation in the past 24 hours, it is quite optimistic. The implementation of Norway's mobilization measures is very good, and the German obstruction is ineffective. The number of Norwegian army personnel has now been greatly replenished, and the strength of resistance has increased accordingly. Although the German army received reinforcements yesterday, and its military equipment is far sharper, it has only made slight progress north of Oslo, due to the increased resistance of the Norwegian army. In short, the German occupied area has not expanded significantly, and the current "front line" is between Elverum and Spilleren. As for Narvik in the north, the German army has been defeated and a part of it has fled into Sweden. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden – According to news received here, a German team moved south from Trondheim, but immediately retreated because it could not make progress. The Norwegian army is now holding the Siggeren Fortress. Because the fortress is made of granite, it is not very afraid of air raids. The German army's bombing of the fortress with field artillery also caused little damage. According to reporters from Swedish newspapers, disturbances often occur near Oslo. Organized military resistance has ended, but several teams of Norwegian soldiers, carrying old-fashioned weapons, are now wandering in the forests. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters military reporter stationed in Norway reported that the Norwegian army in Steinkjer, 20 miles north of Trondheim, has reportedly joined forces with the British army. General Weisen of the German army has sent teams to attack in three directions, attempting to seize control of the Trondheim-Oslo railway. However, in order to achieve this goal, the German army must first defeat the Norwegian army in Steinkjer. When assisting allied forces in combat, the rugged terrain of the Norwegian northwest border may be used. This strategy must have someone familiar with the geography there as a guide in order to be effective. Fortunately, the British expeditionary force has found such talents in the Norwegian army. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden – According to a Norwegian phone call, the German army in the Trondheim area is currently making hasty preparations to deal with the expected attack by the British and Norwegian forces. The people in central Norway were very optimistic when they heard the news that British troops had landed in Namsos, 80 miles north of Trondheim. According to news from central Norway, it is only a matter of time before the Allied forces launch an offensive. The mobilization of the Norwegian army in the area has been completed. German troops in southern Norway are being continuously transported by large transport aircraft to reinforce them. Another British force in the north is advancing towards Narvik. Part of the city seems to still be under German control. An observer who followed a Norwegian army across the Swedish border claimed that a large team of British troops, including Canadian ski troops, had landed in a bay north of Narvik. The area has good transportation to the south. The team of British troops has an artillery team, while the German troops in the Narvik area do not. British aircraft attacked the airports in Stjørdal and Værnes near Trondheim, destroying five German aircraft. On Friday, British aircraft attacked Trøndelag, destroying seven German aircraft and hitting a gasoline depot with one bomb. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden – The armies of Britain and Germany in Norway are advancing towards each other. The first major land battle in the European War is approaching. The steep highlands around Trondheim will become the decisive battlefield for the two armies. The Norwegian army has long been stationed there, waiting in formation, right between the British and German armies. German and Allied troops are arriving in Norway by sea, and tens of thousands are advancing rapidly inland. Aircraft are also constantly transporting reinforcements and various military supplies. It is reported that the outposts of the British and German armies are only a few miles apart, and that both sides have surveyed possible positions and dispatched scouts to observe each other. As for the Norwegian army, it is reported that it has dispatched its staff to the British army so that, in addition to providing military assistance, it can also inform the British army of the detailed terrain and enable them to use it for combat. According to news from the Norwegian front, a Norwegian man who escaped from Trondheim today claimed that the German ten-thousand-ton pocket battleship "Lützow" suddenly ran aground near Trondheim during a battle between the German and Allied fleets. However, this news has not been confirmed by other sources. According to another report, although the British navy has bombarded Narvik with artillery for several days, the German army is still holding the area and has not retreated. (International News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Oslo – The area southwest of Oslo, close to the Swedish front, is entirely occupied by German troops. Fifty Norwegian officers and one thousand soldiers were captured. A small number of those who fled to the Swedish border were also detained by the Swedish authorities. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden – According to news received here, late last night, German troops abandoned Slither, a town southeast of Elverum that they had occupied, which is also an important outpost. In addition, battles also took place in Skree and Tangen south of Hamar. In general, the Norwegian and German armies will have a major battle in the Elverum area today or tomorrow. However, the terrain in the area between the city and Hamar is flat, which is beneficial to motorized troops. Although the Norwegian army will resolutely resist, it will not be easy to defend the two places and they may fall into German hands again. At present, the German army is afraid that the British will send troops to the area to assist the Norwegian army, so they are trying their best to destroy the communication lines. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Large Numbers of German Troops Transported to Norway by Airplanes</p>
<p>London – A Norwegian official who had just arrived in England from Norway told a Reuters reporter that large numbers of German troops are arriving in Oslo and Bergen by plane from Denmark every day. Although the sea route is no longer open to the Germans, reinforcements are still being transported by air. It is estimated that the total number of German troops in Norway is about 50,000. German aircraft bombed and strafed with machine guns the Norwegian cabinet members and congressmen hiding in the forest. At that time, he was only fifty yards away from the Norwegian King. Details of the German aircraft's attack on the Norwegian King and other news will be published in the Norwegian White Paper. This book is currently being compiled in London and will be published approximately tomorrow. The Norwegian King was attacked by German aircraft a total of three times, first in Hamar, then in Elverum, and most recently in Nybergsund. The government has now moved to a safe and convenient location and has complete control of the administration. Norway's mobilization is still in progress. Although the youth in the cities occupied by the German army cannot escape to join the army, the impact is minimal. The official also said that the rumors circulating outside about Norwegian officials colluding with the enemy are false. Most of them are not colluding with the enemy. The orders received by the Norwegian army and officials were mostly forged by the Germans. Several generals did not doubt it when they first received the orders, believing that they were issued by the General Staff, ordering them not to resist and not to open fire on the Germans. It was not until the German army opened fire on them that they realized they had been deceived. The official concluded that the so-called puppet government is a complete farce, so it should collapse soon. The Norwegian government has instructed the mayor of Oslo to take over the administrative organs in the area, and a committee organized by the president of the university there and others will assist him. This committee has nothing to do with the Germans, but only performs its duties in the occupied areas where the government cannot temporarily exercise its powers. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>4,000 Norwegian Soldiers Retreat into Swedish Territory</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden – Four thousand Norwegian soldiers retreated into Swedish territory last night in the Värmland area. According to news from Karlstad, the Swedish authorities will build concentration camps to accommodate them. It is reported that the Swedish government plans to evacuate the residents of the town of Arvika near the border and use the empty houses to accommodate Norwegian refugees. (Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<p>New German Troops Arrive Around Trondheim</p>
<p>Berlin – The German Command Headquarters announced this afternoon that enemy warships and transport ships north of Narvik were attacked by German aircraft and suffered heavy damage. A submarine was hit by a bomb and sank immediately. The German army around Trondheim has become even more powerful since the arrival of new troops. The German army near Stavanger and Bergen is developing in all directions. There is no battle in the Kristiansand area. In the Oslo area, the German army continues to advance to the northeast and northwest. The area occupied by the German army southeast of Oslo has been expanded to the Swedish border. In this area, the German army captured countless military weapons and supplies from the Norwegian army, such as 83 cannons, 80 machine guns, 20,000 shells, and 1 million bullets, which can be seen as a glimpse. The German Navy continues to carry out operations to eliminate enemy submarines in the Skagerrak and Kattegat. About three enemy submarines were destroyed. The German army inspected Norwegian military freighters in various ports and found many mines and other military supplies belonging to the British. In the Hardanger Fjord, a German patrol boat sank a Norwegian torpedo boat. There were no major battles on the Western Front today. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<p>German Political Circles Boast that Naval Warfare Has Been Revolutionized</p>
<p>Berlin – The theme of discussion in Berlin political circles for several days is the revolution in naval warfare after the Northern European war. The so-called revolution in naval warfare refers to the cooperation of the air force. According to the experience of the Northern European war, those without a superior air force cannot occupy a dominant position in naval power. It is needless to say that the British navy exceeds the German navy, but due to the superiority of the German air force, the British navy cannot exert its effectiveness. Six months after the start of the war, the reason why the British navy could not blockade the German Bight as in the First European War, even Churchill admitted, was because the sharpness of the German air force made British ships too dangerous. Secondly, on April 9, Germany occupied Norway with the help of German reconnaissance and bombing aircraft, which also made the British navy unable to do anything. Berlin political figures pointed out that Germany's current position relies on the army and air force, while Britain's position in the Far East and the Mediterranean depends entirely on the navy.

<h3 id="e23">Martial Law Declared Throughout the Netherlands; Prime Minister Gerbrandy Broadcasts Speech <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Hague – Dutch Prime Minister Gerbrandy announced in a radio broadcast this afternoon that a state of siege has been extended to the entire Netherlands. Previously, only certain designated areas had declared this state. The Dutch Prime Minister's speech, addressed to the people of the Netherlands proper and its overseas territories, urged people to remain calm and said that the mission they are currently undertaking is to serve neutrality. If they want to avoid being drawn into the whirlpool, they must be prepared to use their good services for the use of all belligerent countries at any time. "We rely entirely on ourselves. We avoid alliances because they may be detrimental to our neutrality, so the government has rejected all offers of assistance or protection from third parties. This principle is equally implemented in our overseas territories." When Dutch Prime Minister talked about many of the government's work, he said that the government intended to increase the national defense strength to the highest level and to use all resources within its powers. All belligerent countries do not need to fear that someone will launch an attack through our territory. Those who fear that we will not be able to defend ourselves or that our neutrality will be undermined by political institutions, I dare to reiterate that the government's policy has long been decided, that is, to maintain neutrality towards all parties. No threat can make us deviate from this goal. All "obstructive aid" will be met with our military resistance. The government has decided to extend the state of siege to the entire country in order to maintain this policy. Please do not panic unnecessarily. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Dutch Capital – Martial law has just been declared throughout the Netherlands. According to official explanation, this matter was not initially caused by the foreign situation, but its motive was domestic policy. According to general knowledge, extremist parties such as the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party that obey foreign countries will be dissolved by the government. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e26">Italian Statement: No Hegemonic Intentions in the Mediterranean; Follows a Policy of Cooperation with Related Nations; Advocates a System of International Equilibrium; Rumors of Italy and Germany Forcing Spain to Change Policies <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Rome. Gaeda, a spokesperson for Mussolini, wrote in an Italian newspaper that Italy's Mediterranean policy is not one of hegemony but rather a policy of cooperation with all countries, especially those in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean system advocated by Italy must be based on the balance of rights and national power, as well as international guarantees of freedom of action and access. This system also includes Italy's intention to cooperate with Islam, in accordance with its traditional and current policies towards the Mediterranean and Red Seas. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>London. The general public here is now paying attention to Italy's attitude towards the Balkan Peninsula. Some say that Italy is about to invade the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia, which, if true, would inevitably lead to a Mediterranean war. It is also heard that the German and Italian authorities are exerting great pressure on Spain to change its policies. Although the country will not abandon its neutrality for the time being, if Britain and France go to war with Italy, Spain's relationship with Britain and France will likely change accordingly. Furthermore, the British Ambassador to Italy, Loraine, is about to return to his post, demanding that the Italian government explain its true intentions. Political figures also believe that countries along the Mediterranean coast, especially Egypt, as well as the protectorates and mandates of Britain and France, should take all necessary precautionary measures at this time. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>London. The Minister of Economic Warfare, Cross, made a speech in Sheffield yesterday. After commenting on Italy's current attitude, officials here generally believe that the speech was very timely, and its wording was accurate and representative of British public opinion. However, Cross's intention was neither to present an ultimatum to Italy nor to demand that it explain its position. In essence, Britain has always adhered to the letter and spirit of the Anglo-Italian Agreement of 1938, and it fully understands Italy's interests in the Balkan countries. However, Britain also has interests in those countries and believes that maintaining peace in that region is in the inherent interests of both Britain and Italy. Furthermore, when representatives from Romania, Yugoslavia, Hungary, and Bulgaria held a meeting in the capital of Yugoslavia the other day, they reached an agreement on guaranteeing the safety of navigation on the Danube River. The peace of the Balkan Peninsula seems to have been strengthened as a result. Therefore, the British government has expressed great approval of this meeting. However, recently, Italian newspapers have clearly adopted an anti-British and anti-French attitude, and the Italian government has also made some preparations in the military field. All of this is not welcomed by Britain. It is hoped that Prime Minister Mussolini can still act with a realistic spirit and refrain from acting rashly, so as to avoid further aggravating the current tense situation. This would truly benefit both Britain and Italy. Some say that if Germany were to invade Hungary in the future, Italy would be unable to maintain its neutrality and would then first occupy the Dalmatian coast of Yugoslavia in order to "protect Italian interests." However, the British and French forces in the Mediterranean, especially their naval power, are extremely strong. No matter how Italy's policy changes drastically, Britain and France can deal with it calmly. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>London. According to special dispatches here, the New York Times reported from Berlin that Germany's war in Scandinavia was originally intended to give Italy a good impression. Now, Germany feels disappointed in this regard. Not only did it fail to end this war in one day, but it has dragged on for nine days and is still not over. Hitler originally intended to show off to Mussolini with the victory in Scandinavia and a similar blow on the other front. Now that he cannot, he can only pour all his national military power into seeking success. However, whether this will be convenient strategically and economically is doubtful. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>Wardha, India. After four days of discussion with Gandhi, the Working Committee of the All-India National Congress has passed a resolution instructing the National Congress in various parts of India to prepare to declare a non-cooperation movement and advising members of the Congress who are unable to undertake the struggle under the strict guidance of the Congress to resign from their positions. The resolution firmly declares that it will fulfill the conditions for civil disobedience proposed by Gandhi, including a provision against violence. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>London. The Under-Secretary of State for India, Woolmer, stated in the House of Commons yesterday during a debate on extending the term of administrative privileges of the provincial governors of India for one year, following the resignation of the Congress cabinets in the Indian provinces, that if a civil disobedience movement occurs in India, the British government is determined to adopt various plans to deal with it. Orderly administration must be maintained, especially during wartime. He believes that the leaders of the All-India National Congress must also recognize this point. The provincial governments of India have not collapsed. Autonomous provinces account for one-third of British India. The meeting between the Viceroy and Gandhi ended in a stalemate, which has greatly disappointed millions of Indians. The British government naturally cannot accept the All-India Congress's demand for complete independence and regrets the All-India Congress's rejection of the status of an overseas dominion. If the British government were to follow the demand of the Congress, it would directly sever the relationship between India and the British Empire. British sovereignty would no longer be seen in the Indian constitution, and Britain's obligations to Muslims, princes, and minorities would be completely abandoned. The Viceroy has clearly expounded the British government's policy of granting India the status of a fully self-governing dominion at the earliest possible opportunity and studying the entire constitutional framework with all parties in India. Unfortunately, this proposal has not been adopted by the Congress Party. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<h3 id="e34">Japan's Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministries Hold Joint Meeting; No Criticism of Hull's Declaration; Arita Describes Course of Dutch-Japanese Negotiations; Tokyo Newspapers Publish Fiercely Anti-American Arguments <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo. Senior officials from Japan's Foreign, Army, and Navy Ministries held a joint meeting and decided to completely ignore the message issued yesterday by U.S. Secretary of State Hull, in which he asked all countries, especially Japan, to respect the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told reporters today that they believed any criticism of Hull's remarks would be superfluous, as the discussions between Japan and the Netherlands regarding the Dutch East Indies had completely clarified Japan's intentions. The spokesperson expressed satisfaction with the reply of Dutch Foreign Minister Kleffens to the remarks of Japanese Ambassador to the Netherlands Ishii. It is said that Kleffens indicated that the Dutch government understands the Japanese government's attitude towards the issue of the Dutch East Indies. At the same time, Kleffens explained that the Dutch government has not sought protection of the Dutch East Indies from any country, nor will it do so in the future. The Dutch government is determined to reject any offer of protection or intervention that may be made by other countries. One reporter stated that Arita's remarks on Sunday assumed that the Netherlands might be drawn into a war, causing the Dutch government to cease exercising power in the Dutch East Indies. In that case, the Japanese government would recognize the local authorities of the islands. The spokesperson replied that Arita's remarks not only referred to a special development in the overall situation but also any development that would affect the status quo of the Dutch East Indies as the European war expanded. Furthermore, he clarified that the islands are not a colony of the Netherlands but a part of Dutch territory. Therefore, even if the Netherlands is ruled by a belligerent country or several belligerent countries, it does not mean that the Dutch East Indies will disappear from the map. In addition, he was unwilling to add further criticism of the hypothetical situation. Asked whether any negotiations were underway between Japan and the Netherlands, the spokesperson answered in the affirmative. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. After U.S. Secretary of State Hull issued a statement yesterday regarding the Dutch East Indies, Japanese newspapers have responded to it with mostly hostile arguments. The Asahi Shimbun stated that the United States' attitude is quite unfriendly and incomprehensible, with an unnecessary air of intervention in Western Pacific affairs. The Hochi Shimbun stated that the United States, which must speak out on everything, has now issued another statement, reiterating its arbitrary international views and citing treaties that are clearly in conflict with Japanese theories. It considers Japanese theories to be the only way to correct the injustices of the Far East and the world, and that peace cannot be achieved without a new and just order. Undoubtedly, Hull's statement is intended to politically obstruct Japan's southward policy, but the United States must know that this attempt will only anger the Japanese people. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that the possible foreign occupation of the Dutch East Indies is a balloon to test how various countries will react to this issue. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that although both Tokyo and Washington have repeatedly stated their desire to see the status quo maintained, their positions are vastly different. Japan has a fundamental policy of stabilizing that part of the world, just as the United States has its Monroe Doctrine. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>London. The remarks made by Japanese Foreign Minister Arita earlier this week regarding the Dutch East Indies became the subject of questions in the House of Commons last night. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Graham asked the government to guarantee that it would not, when the war zone extends to the Netherlands, allow Japan to unilaterally maintain maritime peace in the Dutch East Indies. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that, to the best of Foreign Secretary Halifax's knowledge, the Japanese government has not requested sole responsibility for maintaining maritime peace in that area. Arita told reporters that the Japanese government must be deeply concerned about any development that would affect the status quo of the Dutch East Indies as the European war expands. At the same time, the British government holds a similar view on this issue, which is probably needless to say. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Morgan asked whether Chamberlain would guarantee that Britain would consult with the U.S. government and adopt mutually agreeable policies if the war continues to affect developments in the Far East. Butler replied that the British government has always kept the U.S. government informed of all events that affect the common interests of Britain and the United States in the Far East. However, the future policy of the United States in that region must, of course, be decided solely by the U.S. government. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

<p>Tokyo. Mr. Suma, the spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry, recently told the press that if the Philippine immigration bill is based on population issues, Japan will not oppose it. However, the immigration of people from other countries to the Philippines is clearly not as large as that of people from China and Japan. Therefore, the bill is actually restricting Chinese and Japanese people. Suma also stated that in the past few years, an average of more than 2,800 Japanese people have immigrated to the Philippines each year. If the immigration bill is implemented, Japanese immigration will be limited by one-fifth, as the bill only allows 500 people to immigrate from each country each year. This is a serious blow to Japan. (United Press, 19th)</p>

Mr. Sayre, the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, is traveling to Shanghai on the ship. Admiral Hart, the Commander-in-Chief of the Asiatic Fleet, and the submarine tender USS Canopus, along with six submarines, have set off and are en route along the Chinese coast. Other warships are preparing to set sail for China within the week. Several destroyers, six submarines, and fourteen reconnaissance aircraft are patrolling the territorial waters of the Philippines, maintaining neutrality. People here are very interested in U.S. Secretary of State Hull's statement regarding the Dutch East Indies. Some believe that the statement is the attitude that the United States will take if the Philippines is threatened. Philippine independence activists say that if the United States is concerned about the welfare of Dutch territories, it should be doubly concerned about the welfare of the Philippines, which the United States has been working to make independent for forty years.

<p>Amsterdam. Last night, the official news agency here stated that the Dutch government has informed the Japanese government, stating that if the Netherlands is unfortunately drawn into the war, the Netherlands will not need to request protection of the Dutch East Indies from a foreign country. The official report emphasizes that if the Netherlands participates in the war, the Dutch East Indies will be legally and factually capable of self-defense. (Haitong, 19th)</p>
<p>Manila. American military observers who have recently returned from Java said that the conquest of the East Indies is even more difficult than that of the Philippines. They stated that the Dutch East Indies has recently built a powerful air force, which is unmatched in the Far East except for Japan. The air force includes 150 American bombers and other American-style aircraft, which are piloted by well-trained Dutch pilots. The observers said that the large-scale fortification of Borneo, Java, and Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies in the past two years has not been noticed by most people in the world.

<h3 id="e40">British Commerce in China Suffers Discrimination; Members of Parliament Urge Government to Pay Attention <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>London. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Graham asked in the House of Commons yesterday whether the discriminatory treatment of British shipping in places such as Qingdao is the responsibility of the Japanese Asia Development Board. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied in writing that, in his opinion, pointing out that the actions that discriminate against British interests are the responsibility of a certain Japanese party is of no help. Whenever such discrimination occurs, the British government always negotiates with the appropriate Japanese authorities or directly with the Japanese government. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Morgan stated that the Japanese authorities in Qingdao recently asked a certain American company why it was using British ships to load goods and claimed that if the next shipment still uses non-Japanese ships, the Japanese side will not provide the same conveniences as Japanese ships. He continued this action is evidence of a policy to eliminate British commerce in the Far East. The British government should negotiate with the Japanese government. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler also submitted a written reply, stating that Foreign Secretary Halifax has paid attention to this matter but has not yet obtained conclusive evidence. Recently, it seems that there have been frequent campaigns to persuade cargo owners not to load British ships. The government is currently giving active consideration to this entire matter.

<p>London. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Knox asked in the House of Commons yesterday about the import trade in Hankou, asking the Prime Minister whether he was aware that the import trade in Hankou was monopolized by the Japanese and that the scope was gradually expanding. He also asked what measures the government planned to take to restore and protect British commerce in the interior of China. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that, according to recent information, although tung oil is being shipped to the United States, trade in Hankou is currently still stagnant. Even if there is a small amount of trade, it is in the hands of the Japanese. The British government is eager to have the restrictions currently encountered by British trade removed as soon as possible and has already brought this matter to the attention of the Japanese government.

<p>Washington.

<p>Tokyo. The New York Times recently published a report that Japan is currently building multiple super battleships, the power of which exceeds that of the warships of other countries. Japanese naval figures believe that this statement is "propaganda carried out by the United States, the purpose of which is to stimulate domestic public opinion in favor of the country's continued expansion of its navy." The naval staffs of various countries often keep secret information obtained about Japan's shipbuilding plans. This is no different from Japan's efforts to avoid leaking shipbuilding secrets. Therefore, it is still difficult to know for sure whether Japan is building such battleships. However, according to the views of foreign authorities, this shipbuilding plan is "quite possible." Regarding this matter, there is often a special atmosphere of optimism whenever naval issues are involved in the recent meetings of the Japanese House of Representatives. In particular, when the House of Representatives discussed the impact that the U.S. Vinson Naval Act could have on Japan, Navy Minister Yoshida seemed very confident in Japan's naval power. At that time, several members of the House of Representatives raised inquiries, saying they didn't know whether the implementation of Japan's planned Fourth Naval Expansion Plan (from 1939 to 1943, which is to supplement the Third Plan from 1937 to 1941) will be disrupted due to the U.S. Vinson Plan. Navy Minister Yoshida immediately replied, "We have made a thorough study of the U.S. shipbuilding plan and have concluded that there is no need to worry. There is no need for Japan to respond immediately. The House of Representatives only needs to approve the budget requested by the Ministry of the Navy." Although the above situation is only a psychological sign, it is also something worth noting. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>Tianjin. The organ newspaper of the Japanese military authorities here reported that the lifting of the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concessions is only a matter of time. Based on the negotiations between Britain and Japan, especially after the meeting between British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki on the 13th of this month, there has been rapid development. Therefore, the Tianjin issue is expected to be fully resolved by the end of this month or the beginning of May. The current negotiations are only related to minor incidents. The resolution of the silver issue, including the silver deposited in the French concession, is also included. After discussions in Tokyo, the British and Japanese authorities in Tianjin will determine the final details of the agreement to be concluded. The Japanese military authorities in the city are preparing to lift the blockade when the agreement is signed. The silver deposited in the two concessions will be kept in custody by a joint committee representing China, Britain, Japan, France, and the United States. The silver in the British concession, worth 14 million yuan, will have 100,000 British pounds allocated for relief purposes. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Tianjin. Regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Tianjin issue, which are currently being conducted between Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki and British Ambassador to Japan Craigie, the central issue of the silver problem will be resolved soon. The negotiations between Japan and France will also be able to proceed due to the overall resolution of the Japanese-Japanese negotiations. In addition, these minor negotiations between Japan and Britain and Japan and France will be conducted locally. After all procedures are completed, the Japanese side may automatically withdraw the restrictions on isolating traffic to and from the concessions. (Domei News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Beiping. The Xinmin Bao recently published a work report from March by the "Chinese People's Anti-British Movement Committee" in Beiping. According to the report, during this period, the committee investigated 50 shops to determine if they had British goods and warned two Chinese landlords not to renew leases with British residents and to evict them as soon as possible. As a result, three British residents have been evicted. In addition, the committee warned Chinese people working in British barracks, the British Embassy, British trading companies, and British private residences, urging them to resign immediately. At the same time, it established a relief department to seek welfare for workers who have left their British employers. However, only one worker registered in March.

<h3 id="e46">Slim Chances of Opening Kuling This Summer: An Observation from a Foreign Resident <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Hankou: According to the opinion of a foreign resident who recently inspected the situation at Kuling, the possibility of reopening Kuling this summer is quite slim. The Sino-Japanese war has caused many difficulties and disrupted everything. The primary difficulty is the transportation problem of traveling to Kuling, traversing the plains and climbing the mountains. Ships, vehicles, and laborers have all been requisitioned for military needs, leaving only a few sedan chairs. The issue of supplies for those seeking summer retreat is also a major obstacle. As the rural areas have been disrupted by the war, food, fuel, and labor are difficult to obtain. The new Kuling Management Office is currently compiling a list of landowners, as the former Lushan Management Bureau took all records with them. Landowner registration is now underway, but many landowners have left, and communication is poor, hindering the registration process. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry yesterday released the thirteenth document from the Polish archives, a report from the Polish Ambassador to Sweden, Potołowski, to the Polish Foreign Minister, dated April 15, 1939. The original text is as follows: "The British Secretary for Overseas Trade, Hudson, declared here yesterday that his trip had not achieved many successes. Mr. Hudson's remarks seemed somewhat lacking in tact, causing resentment among economic figures here. A certain prominent Swedish financier told me that, based on Mr. Hudson's view of Sweden's attitude, should war break out in the future, Sweden should prohibit the export of all raw materials to Germany. This interpretation by Swedish figures suggests that Sweden is willing to maintain neutrality, but if Germany controls the Baltic Sea, Sweden would be unable to refuse the export of ore to Germany. During a meeting with reporters, Mr. Hudson strongly stated that Sweden should increase its exports to England. If the economic delegation cannot achieve its goals, then England will demand revisions to the existing trade agreement. Swedish economic figures believe this statement is unacceptable. Even if England does not buy Swedish steel and agricultural tools, Sweden can find better markets in Germany. Regarding Anglo-Swedish trade relations, the 'Tidningen' newspaper published an editorial on April 13, stating that the imported goods that England buys from Sweden are mostly raw materials and manufactured goods essential to British industry, the value of which is lower than the domestic Swedish market by as much as 60 percent. From Sweden's standpoint, it is hoped that this system can be abolished so that domestic prices can be brought back to normal." Signed, Polish Ambassador to Sweden, Potołowski.

<h3 id="e48">The Passing of Song Zheyuan: Developed Hemiplegia in Guizhou, Moved to Sichuan for Recuperation, Sadly Perished <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Chengdu Air Mail: General Song Zheyuan passed away on the 5th of this month at the Yong'an Apartment in Mianyang. Upon hearing the sad news, everyone was deeply saddened. Song developed hemiplegia in Guiyang in the winter of the year before last. Subsequently, on June 3rd of last summer, he passed through Chongqing and Chengdu to Guanxian for recuperation. On March 11th of this year, he moved to Mianyang for medical treatment, but because the illness had reached an advanced stage, medical treatment was ineffective, and he passed away. He lived in Sichuan for convalescence for a total of ten months. Few know about his daily life. The following is an account of his life as described by Yang Wenqing, a friend of Song:</p>
<p>Song was originally in good health. In the winter of the 27th year, he traveled to Guiyang on official business and caught a cold. One day, when Japanese planes attacked Guiyang, he and Councilor Zhao Xinru and others went to a mountain temple near Guiyang for temporary shelter. He was lightly dressed while ill, and the mountain wind exacerbated his condition. Within a few days, it turned into hemiplegia. After seeking medical treatment, he slightly recovered, but movement of his limbs remained inconvenient. In May of last year, he traveled from Guiyang to Chongqing. Upon the doctor's advice for long-term recuperation, he went to Guanxian for convalescence.</p>
<p>On June 5th, Song went to Guanxian and resided near the Guanhong Pavilion outside Dongguan. His new residence was built in advance by Deng Zhexi and others. The residence consisted of three courtyards, a small building, and several thatched huts, with ten acres of land developed into a garden with bamboo fences and thatched cottages, which was quite elegant. In addition to his wife and fifth and sixth daughters, old friends and staff members Zhao Xinru, Deng Zhexi, Qin Dechun, Yang Zhennan, Zhang Yueting, Lü Runzhai, and Deng Jian were also present. Song entertained himself by planting flowers and trees, and rare flowers and plants filled the garden.</p>
<p>After living in the countryside for more than a month, his illness slightly improved, and he suddenly felt the urge to travel, climbing Qingcheng Mountain. He stayed in the mountains for five days, touring scenic spots. He occasionally spoke with Taoist priests and became interested in Taoist teachings. He returned home with many volumes of Laozi, Zhuangzi, and Taoist scriptures for reading and study, and began practicing meditation for self-cultivation. While living in Guanxian, he occasionally stayed in Chengdu for medical treatment.</p>
<p>In October of last year, Song's blood pressure rose. He came to Chengdu to seek treatment from Qi Jinan, the president of the National Central University Medical College, and gradually improved after half a month. In late February of this year, a Western medical examination revealed that he had a stomach bleeding disease. Many friends believed that the water quality in Guanxian was not suitable for Song's health and decided to move to Mianyang. They leased the entire Yong'an Apartment on Yanshi Street. On March 11th, he moved to Mianyang. After living there for ten days, his blood pressure increased further, and his illness worsened. Song's old mother is already eighty years old and still lives in the North. Song's illness was severe, and he was saddened that he could not serve his elderly mother, and he and his wife wept together. Starting from the 26th, he was unable to eat. In three days, he only consumed half a cup of milk and boiled water. From the 30th to the 4th of this month, he fell unconscious several times. He passed away from his illness at 2:00 PM on the 5th. During his illness, Song still hoped to recover soon and return to the front lines.</p>
<p>At the time of his death, Qin Dechun, Deng Zhexi, Yang Zhennan, and others rushed to Mianyang. Song told Qin and others that the War of Resistance had not yet achieved final victory. As a soldier, he was unable to fulfill his duties and serve on the battlefield, a regret that could not be erased.</p>
<p>While Song was convalescing in Guanxian, he donated 13,000 yuan, using 7,000 yuan to establish an orphanage in Guanxian and 6,000 yuan to establish a poor people's hospital.</p>

<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The turmoil in our county, Yu Rong, has intensified recently. Previously, due to the lack of auxiliary coins, stamps were used as substitutes, but they were easily soiled, and the business community unanimously refused to use them. Then, a copper coin was temporarily used as one cent of auxiliary currency for circulation, but it was soon rejected again. Disputes arose between stores and customers, and small merchants and common people suffered the most. The other day, stores in the city consulted on relief measures and decided that one copper coin would be used as one cent, which seemed inappropriate. In order to take both sides into consideration, according to the previous practice of 130 copper coins per yuan, a compromise was reached to convert 150 copper coins into one yuan of legal tender, that is, 15 copper coins as one dime of legal tender. Starting from the 15th, copper coins in the market will be universally circulated, but they cannot be used in full. For example, three to seven are used together. If there are 15 copper coins, they can be used as one dime of legal tender, and three copper coins can be used as two cents of auxiliary coins. As for the copper coin notes issued by the Provincial Finance Department, the people mostly distrust and do not use them.</p>

<p>(Xining Correspondence) In order to promote Mongolian and Tibetan education, the Mongolian and Tibetan Cultural Promotion Association has recently established one Mongolian and Tibetan elementary school in each of the districts of Sanjiao City in the Haidong Administrative Bureau, Yuanqunke Wutu, Right Wing League Haza, Qunke Banner Shanghudanpi, and Tuer Shihuachu Mang, and appointed Tong Quhu as the chief preparatory member of the Zizang Elementary School in Sanjiao City, Haidong; Zhang Tingwei, Cang Huaizhi, and Liu Tongji as preparatory members; Bao Yongde as the chief preparatory member of the Wutu Mongolian and Tibetan Elementary School in Huangyuan Qunke Banner; Yang Siliang, Wang Yu'an, and Ma Baoshan as preparatory members; Lin Qin Zhafal as the chief preparatory member of the Right Wing League Ha Mongolian and Tibetan Elementary School; Ma Suonan, Ma Shengtai, and Fang Yannian as preparatory members; Qi Huajie Danliqicai Dili as the preparatory member of the Shanghudanpi Mongolian and Tibetan Elementary School in Qunke Banner; Mang Qianduo Jie as the preparatory member of the Tuer Shi Mongolian and Tibetan Elementary School; Duo Cai Dan Li Shengrong as the preparatory member of the Weimang Mongolian and Tibetan Elementary School in Hualong County; and Tang Yongqi as the Chinese teacher of the school.</p>
<p>Chairman Ma Zixiang of the Association, considering that the Mongolian and Tibetan people in various places are not proficient in Chinese language, making teaching difficult, ordered Councilors Luosang Xiangqu and Sangre Jiacuo to translate two kinds of elementary school Chinese language common sense textbooks into Tibetan textbooks starting last year to make them the reading materials for students in schools in various Mongolian and Tibetan areas in the province. Now the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh volumes of Chinese language and the first, second, third, and fourth volumes of common sense have been translated. The translated first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh volumes of Chinese language have been proofread by Grand Master Xirao of the National Five Universities Tibetan Culture Lecture and Secretary General Xianrong of the Provincial Government and are now being engraved on wooden blocks by the Association to prepare for mass printing for distribution to Mongolian and Tibetan school students. In the future, when this translation is completed, it will surely have a great effect on the promotion of Mongolian and Tibetan education in this province. It is also heard that after the completion of this translation, the Association plans to first distribute it to elementary school students in various Mongolian and Tibetan areas in the mainland, and after they graduate from elementary school, they will be sent to Mongolian and Tibetan elementary schools in the province to study Chinese and Tibetan languages as teachers for promoting Mongolian and Tibetan education in the future, and to plan for the development of Mongolian and Tibetan education in this province. Overseas schools that have not been registered should apply for registration as soon as possible.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Air Mail) In recent years, many overseas Chinese schools in various places have applied to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for registration. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in addition to providing various guidance and encouragement to all registered overseas Chinese schools, also provides appropriate assistance in terms of teachers, books, instruments, and cash within the scope of its financial capabilities to those who are indeed outstanding in academic performance or have other difficulties. Moreover, students who graduate from these schools and return to China for further studies are given special preferential treatment and introduced to schools according to their wishes. In addition, elementary school diplomas from registered overseas Chinese schools must be verified and sealed by the local consulate, and middle school diplomas must be verified and sealed by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. Those who hold such verified and sealed diplomas will be given special preferential treatment and lenient admission when returning to China for further studies or transferring to domestic schools. Given this situation, all unregistered overseas schools should apply to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for registration as soon as possible in order to obtain direct guidance from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and their graduates can also obtain various conveniences when returning to China for further studies or transferring.</p>

<p>(Kunming Air Mail) The Third Mobile Drama Education Team of the Ministry of Education, since its establishment in Chongqing the year before last, has been led by Yu Wen and Wang Mianzhi to work in the four provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Kangding in the Southwest. The team believes that to engage in anti-Japanese construction propaganda, it is necessary to deeply engage in rural areas with a spirit of perseverance to complete a truly national mobilization. Therefore, the team has been working hard for more than a year, earnestly deeply engaging in the villages and towns of the southwestern rear areas, especially in the Miao area, where the results have been the greatest. They often live with the Miao compatriots and engage in education, sometimes deeply engaging in the wilderness and bandit areas of various counties, using the power of cultural education to persuade compatriots to participate in the War of Resistance. The work takes various forms, such as giving medicine and diagnosis, etc., to closely approach the masses. They also use various realistic themes to create scripts and songs, aiming at the actual living conditions of farmers to achieve the purpose of propaganda and education. The team also regularly jointly organizes training classes such as drama, singing, and literacy with local governments. In the past year, the work areas have included Qijiang in Sichuan, Zunyi in Guizhou, Aiyang, Anshun Panxian, and each place has worked for more than three months. The team also mimeographs a "Newsletter" to report on the social conditions and work realities in remote areas. In February of this year, they went to Kunming from Guizhou to participate in military labor performances and to entertain the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Repatriation Comfort Group that passed through Yunnan. They also successively performed five dramas related to anti-Japanese construction, which were highly admired and respected by the audience.</p>

<p>The Third Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Tournament held the knockout round of the seventh group yesterday. More than 300 people attended. The first group was seeded player Ma Tingliang against newcomer Huang Fen. The former was the runner-up in the previous tournament, and the latter was originally named Huang Fufu. Huang was eliminated by Ma in the preliminary round last year. After a year, Huang was eager to avenge his defeat, so the competition was fierce and unwilling to give in. The two sides tied each other at two games each. In the final game, Huang was strong and took the lead with a score of 9 to 5. Unexpectedly, Old Ma was determined to fight to the end and relied on his steady shots to tie the score at 10 to 10. Under the switch of serve, Ma took the lead with one point. Huang did not flinch under this situation and won three points in a row to win 13 to 11. In conclusion, Huang eliminated Old Ma 3 to 2, avenging his defeat last year. Old Ma has been a dominant figure in the table tennis world for ten years, but he lost to a newcomer due to a single point, which was unexpected. Afterwards, Huang Fei took advantage of the remaining power and defeated Fei Chunhua, a skilled chopper, and faced Gu, a hard hitter, in the final. Gu was brave but lacked strategy. Huang defeated Gu 3-0 to win the seventh group championship. The results of the final are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>Ice skating (Ice Skating, not running on ice) is popular all over the world. The Olympics has official world championships. This sport has been absent in Shanghai due to climate. The Yindu Artificial Ice Skating Rink at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Foch Road has now been completed. From now on, ice skating can also be practiced in Shanghai. The rink is luxuriously equipped and grand in scale. It was originally scheduled to open on the 19th, but due to insufficient construction, it has been changed to open on the 27th of this month. The rink entertained Chinese and foreign journalists on the evening of the 17th, as well as many movie stars, child star Chen Juanjuan, Han Gen, Yin Xiucen, etc. There was a meal and singing.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Proposed Tax Increase Will Cause Rent Disputes: Like Dropping a Bomb: Future Hidden Dangers Are Worrying <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Annual Meeting of Foreign Ratepayers has hastily passed the tax increase proposal, and ratepayers within the district feel disappointed. According to Fan Kelin's report at the Annual Meeting, "After repeated consideration, the Board has decided to uniformly levy a surcharge of 50% on the current tax rate starting from July 1st of this year. At the same time, the surcharge for various license fees will be increased from 10% to 50% to supplement funds." This is the content of the tax increase proposal. Ratepayers will be bearing a 50% tax increase in two months.</p>
<p>A Rent Uprising Is About to Erupt</p>
<p>According to a certain ratepayer, the passage of the tax increase proposal is like dropping a heavy bomb on the rent issue. Rent disputes will continue to surge. We point our fingers at the sub-landlords who take advantage of the situation to increase rents to third-party tenants. The passage of the tax increase now provides an even greater excuse. The increased taxes for stores will inevitably be passed on to customers, and the increased taxes for landlords will inevitably be passed on to tenants. Therefore, the final burden will still be on the general public. Furthermore, the increase in land taxes will cause real estate owners to continue to increase rents to sub-landlords, and as rents increase, taxes will also increase. Alas, ordinary people truly have no way to make a living.</p>
<p>Western Newspaper Comments on Bus Price Increases</p>
<p>Today's Millard's Review published an article criticizing the Municipal Council and believing that although the Municipal Council currently claims to reduce the cost of living in this city in order to solve the residents' livelihood problems, in reality, we find it difficult to have a good impression of this, because the Municipal Council's "right hand seems to completely disregard what its left hand is doing." The article cites the British-owned</p>
<p>Public Bus</p>
<p>The problem of price increases as an example, saying that "Last Sunday, the Municipal Council issued a statement saying that speculators have already caused serious consequences, but on the same day, the British-owned Public Bus Company, which holds the exclusive franchise in the International Settlement, also announced a 45% price increase. The Municipal Council has naturally approved this matter. The reasons cited by the Public Bus Company are nothing more than the soaring prices of bus</p>
<p>Raw materials</p>
<p>and the recent increase in employees' salaries. Although the British-owned Public Bus Company has not been able to restore its operations in the Hebei District of Suzhou, since 1937, its operating conditions have been better than in the past. If the Municipal Council has the goal of reducing prices in order to maintain the livelihood of residents, and wants to make the residents of the Concession understand that the Municipal Council has indeed engaged in some</p>
<p>Specific measures, then why not stop the price increase of public buses? The inside story is very easy to understand. Moreover, the salaries of most of the foreign employees of the company are paid in foreign currency. The decline in the value of the local currency is regarded by the company as a major loss, because its income is all in legal tender." The article also believes that the only way to solve the current difficulties is to avoid making residents feel</p>
<p>Too burdened. However, the Municipal Council must not nationalize public buses and should aim to operate for the benefit of the public. We suggest that the only solution is to cancel its exclusive franchise and allow the establishment of other public bus companies. In a competitive environment, there may be a little help.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Retirement of Mr. Flander in the Future, Temporarily Not Leaving Shanghai, Plans to Engage in Freelance Work <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Flander, the British head of the Intelligence Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, told reporters yesterday that he would retire on the first of next month. He intends to rest for a few months, after which he will take up another occupation. However, he said that he would not leave Shanghai, as he has lived in Shanghai for over thirty years. Regarding his future, there are currently no concrete plans, but he hopes to write for various newspapers and magazines and engage in freelance work. He said, "I was originally a news reporter. After a few months of vacation, I eagerly wish to resume my leisurely pursuit." He also mentioned that he studied journalism in England. He came to Shanghai in 1911 and engaged in the news business. During the World War, Mr. Flander served in the military. After the war ended, he returned to Shanghai to resume his work. He joined the Shanghai Municipal Council in 1920.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Atrocities by Japanese Troops in the Suburbs of Shanghai: Zhudi Town Completely Burned, Japanese Troops Driving Tanks to Loot, Forcibly Abducting Women and Killing Three Hundred Villagers <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that guerrillas active in western Shanghai have been carrying out activities in recent days. This morning (the 19th), the Japanese army retaliated by setting fire to houses in Zhudi Town, located only a few miles from Hongqiao Airport, abducting women, and firing on villagers who tried to escape. The guerrillas then engaged the Japanese army. Residents of Hongqiao heard the sounds of rifles, machine guns, and even cannons. The fighting ceased at 5:00 AM.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Set Fire</p>
<p>Around 2:00 AM today (the 19th), Japanese troops arrived in multiple trucks, accompanied by twelve tanks, and drove along the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway, turning into Zhudi Town by the Suzhou River. They blamed the villagers for harboring guerrillas and immediately set fire to the town, intending to burn the entire town to the ground, hoping to capture the guerrillas. Zhudi Town is a center for rice and egg businesses. Also, yesterday (the 18th), two wounded women and children came to Shanghai for medical treatment. It is believed that two Japanese soldiers were killed (the two Japanese soldiers were in Baocai Village - transliteration) and wounded during the retaliation. The Japanese army killed them by more than twenty guerrillas. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese army dispatched a large force to Baocai Village on the nights of the 15th and 16th.</p>
<p>Slaughter to Vent Anger</p>
<p>They opened fire on villagers who tried to escape, in order to vent their anger. The people who were killed as many as two hundred. It was reported that after the Chinese mobile units fought with the Japanese army in western Shanghai last Saturday and Sunday, the Japanese army believed that the villagers were harboring guerrillas and providing food. They burned villages and towns in the Shanghai region, falsely accusing farmers of being guerrillas, arresting them, and shooting them. Many farmers were killed, some say more than a hundred.</p>
<p>The Local Area Is Devastated</p>
<p>According to reports, yesterday morning (the 18th), a dense fog obscured the sky. About three miles north of Shanghai in the west, over a hundred Japanese soldiers were seen coming from the Jiading direction, all in plain clothes, heading southwest. Wherever they passed, people scrambled to avoid them. Later, the Japanese troops entered the Qingpu County border west of Zhudi and indiscriminately fired their guns and burned and killed at will. They also insulted the women before killing them. The brutality was especially severe at the beginning. According to farmers in the area, the Xu pseudo-troops recently falsely accused the people of Qingpu County of being reserve guerrillas, leading to Japanese troops from various areas, such as Qingpu, Sijing, Beixinjing, Nanxiang, and Huangbo, gathering in the area in plain clothes for the same operation. Residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled in droves, in an extremely miserable state.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hepburn, Arrives in Shanghai, Soon to Cruise the Waters off Northern China, U.S. Commissioner to the Philippines to Arrive Here Shortly <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, left Shanghai on November 22nd of last year. He travelled with the former U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gao Qi, aboard the flagship Augusta to the Philippines. After staying on the Philippine Islands for a full four months, he arrived in Xiamen on the 17th aboard the private yacht Isabel. Now that his business in Xiamen is concluded, he sailed and arrived in Shanghai at 5:45 PM the day before yesterday (the 18th).</p>
<p>Cruise of Northern China Still to Be Held</p>
<p>Foreign reports suggest that the annual cruise of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet in Chinese waters may not be held this year. This rumor is enough to create the impression that the United States tacitly acknowledges that North China has become a fait accompli. According to U.S. fleet practice, the fleet usually stays in the Philippines during the winter and moves to cruise the waters off North China in late spring and early summer. At the end of May, it changes its anchorage to Yantai and Qingdao. Evidence such as the arrival of the large U.S. seaplane tender Wright in Shanghai, and news that the Augusta and Marblehead will arrive in Shanghai before the end of the month, suggests that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet will still follow its usual practice of cruising in Chinese waters this year. According to foreign reports, Admiral Hepburn rented a house in Qingdao long ago for summering. The various rumors spread because of Admiral Hepburn's arrival are thus self-defeating.</p>
<p>Meeting with Sayre Before Heading North</p>
<p>The admiral's wife and three daughters returned to Shanghai from the Philippines a week earlier aboard the President Coolidge of the American President Lines. They were hosted by Rear Admiral Glassford and are currently staying at the 13-story building on Xipushi Road. It is reported that Admiral Hepburn's Shanghai apartment is also temporarily located there. Yesterday, Admiral Hepburn met with Rear Admiral Glassford and U.S. naval authorities. In addition to handling official business, he will also visit various waters off North China for a routine inspection. However, there is no definite news as to when he will head north. It is likely to be after meeting with U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre. According to foreign reports, Sayre will arrive in Shanghai on the Astoria, but according to reporters' inquiries, he will instead travel aboard the flagship Augusta and then sail to Kobe to transfer to Tokyo to meet with Ambassador Grew. Shanghai, which has been quiet for a long time, has become a focus of diplomatic attention again due to the arrival of Hepburn and Sayre during this time of urgent European turmoil.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Abe "Mission" to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow Afternoon, A Group of Seventy People Including Government and Civilian Representatives, Attempting to Sign a "Unilateral Treaty" after Visiting Nanjing <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Japan's invasion of China has exhausted its resources and it is attempting to create a unilateral peace. It has selected former Prime Minister General Abe Nobuyuki as its plenipotentiary ambassador to the Nanjing "regime." His "mission" is as large as seventy people. They are coming to China from Japan aboard the Kashima Maru and will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai Tomorrow Afternoon</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army launched its war of aggression against China with the "July 7th Incident" and the "August 13th Incident," it has met with heroic resistance everywhere and has become bogged down. It has established a new "regime" and dispatched General Abe Nobuyuki to lead his "mission," which left Tokyo on the 15th and sailed from Kobe on the 18th aboard the Kashima Maru, attempting to sign a "treaty" and create a unilateral peace. It is expected that Abe and his party will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. Japanese military authorities and secret agents stationed in Shanghai are actively engaged in arrangements and security preparations.</p>
<p>Large Number of Entourage</p>
<p>After Abe and others arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, they will rest briefly before heading to Nanjing. The members of this "mission" include General Abe Nobuyuki, High and Matsumoto, two councillors, mission advisors Lieutenant General Sato and Major General Takagi, and representatives from the House of Peers Murahei Yoritoshi, representative of the House of Representatives Koyama Matsuju, representatives of financial circles Hatta Gadon and Shoji Otsukichi, representatives of pro-China groups Nagata Hideketsuro and Ichinomiya Fusajiro, and representatives of the press Tanaka Kichi, Furuno Bokunosuke, and Kikuchi, totaling as many as seventy people. This is truly an unprecedentedly large number. This especially demonstrates Japan's last resort on its road to invading China.</p>
<h3 id="e69">French Concession Equalization Committee Strictly Prohibits Price Gouging, If Merchants Are Not Satisfied with Reasonable Profits, Overcharging and Engaging in Trickery Will Be Investigated by the Police <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The Price Equalization Committee for Daily Necessities in the French Concession recently resolved to publish the prices of daily necessities so that residents can have a reference. Regarding the price limits of goods, no regulations will be added for the time being, but if selling merchants are not satisfied with reasonable profits, price limits will be set. In the future, if residents encounter merchants who excessively raise prices or engage in trickery or fraud in the quality of goods, weights, and measures, they can report to the nearby police station for investigation. The following police stations all accept residents' complaints: (1) Central Police Station at 22 Xuehuali Road, (2) Foch Police Station at 1307 Avenue Joffre, (3) Petain Police Station at 648 Route Frelupt, (4) Joffre Police Station at 235 Avenue Joffre, (5) Malais Police Station at 151 Avenue Edward VII, (6) East District Police Station at 130 The Bund, French Concession. All complaints must be based on facts and reported in writing, and must be signed. Unsigned complaints will not be accepted.</p>
<p>Inspecting Food</p>
<p>The French Concession recently inspected food selling shops. A total of eighty-one butcher shops were admonished or fined for violations, most of which involved cases of counterfeiting meat product grade stamps. Also, two bakeries were fined because the actual weight of the bread did not match the stated weight (a difference of up to one and a half ounces). Inspections were also conducted at various milk farms. Of the sixty-four samples taken, three were found to be adulterated with water. Two milk farms have had their business licenses requested to be revoked by the Health Department to the French Consul General.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Cleanliness</p>
<p>Typhus and relapsing fever are both spread by parasites such as lice. Recently, with the warming weather, typhus has been gradually increasing. Residents should bathe and change clothes frequently to prevent lice from hiding and spreading disease. If approaching someone suspected of having lice, it is best to carry a cloth bag containing fragrances such as mint, bergamot, oil, and naphtha, so that the lice will not dare to approach.</p>

<p>Starting on the first of this month, the Japanese side suddenly dispatched warships to detain flour, ramie, iron, and other goods exported by local export merchants. Even tin foil was among the items detained. This was reported earlier. The detained goods have been returned successively within this week. However, when returning the goods, a "tip" of seventy yuan was required for every thousand yuan of detained goods, causing export merchants not only to fail to make a profit, but also to suffer heavy losses. The Japanese side's "license" system for exported goods is reportedly being studied. If this system is implemented, it can be determined that it will undermine customs authority. Therefore, all parties in the city are now closely monitoring the situation.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Fair-Priced Rice Cannot Be Stopped, All Sectors Share the Burden, The Problem of Rice for Common People Remains Serious, Fourth Phase Decided to Continue, Hoping for Joint Support <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent letters to various guilds and associations yesterday regarding the solicitation of donations for fair-priced rice, stating, "Greetings. We recently received a letter from Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Fair-Priced Rice Committee, stating that the committee has been established for three months, during which three phases of fair-priced rice have been implemented, with donations totaling over 700,000 yuan, and losses also totaling over 700,000 yuan. As the three phases have ended, a small conclusion has been reached. However, at a meeting of the entire committee on the 6th of this month, it was unanimously agreed that the supply of rice is subject to internal control and external exchange rate difficulties, and the price decrease is hopeless. If the fair-priced rice is stopped abruptly, the market will be even more disturbed and famine will be imminent. Therefore, it was decided to continue the operation and increase the number of standing committee members to gather ideas. Although this matter is a small burden for the committee, it is different from moving mountains and crossing the sea. Moreover, it concerns the lives of thousands of poor people.</p>
<p>How Can We Stand Idly By? Therefore, we do not hesitate to bear the burden on one shoulder. Subsequently, at the Standing Committee meeting on the 13th, a plan was made to continue the effort and raise 1 million yuan in donations for fair-priced rice. Over 300,000 yuan was immediately pledged by the standing committee members and representatives of various industries, showing a spirit of harmony and mutual assistance, which is gratifying. However, one tree alone cannot support the forest, and it is inferior to the support of the masses. We believe that your association is the hub of the overall plan and the leader of the community. We dare to hope that you will send letters to various guilds and associations to assist in donations, work hard to contribute, and make this act of charity a success. We are eagerly awaiting your response." Since Shanghai has been affected by the current situation, the price of rice has broken all previous records, making it difficult for common people to make a living. The committee's fair-priced rice program has been in operation for three months. Although</p>
<p>Millions Have Been Lost</p>
<p>the common people have benefited greatly. The problem of rice for common people remains serious. If fair-priced rice is not continued, thousands of poor people will have no way to cook. All losses from fair-priced rice, at this time, we hope that our business community and all sectors will share the burden, and that your association will persuade your colleagues to donate according to their ability, so as to maintain this act of charity. We are eagerly awaiting your response. Please send the donations directly to the Shanghai branches of the Zhongnan, Jincheng, and San banks, and to the Tongrun Money Exchange for collection.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Coal Briquettes Continue to Be Sold at Fair Prices, Sales Period from the 26th, Limited to Ten Days, Retail Fair-Priced Coal Briquettes Exclusively for Poor Households <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Briquette Industry Association held its 29th joint meeting of representatives at its meeting room on Tianjin Road at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the matter of selling coal briquettes at fair prices. More than 20 representatives from Yitaixing, Nanyang, Jinghua, Guohua, and other factories participated in the discussion, chaired by Zhang Shi. (1) Regarding the proposal to temporarily suspend the third phase of fair-priced coal briquettes, which will expire on the 20th of this month, it was resolved that the fair-priced sales would be temporarily suspended on that day. (2) Regarding the proposal to continue the fourth phase of fair-priced coal briquettes, it was resolved that the fair-priced sales would continue for ten days from the 26th of this month to May 5th. Each person is limited to purchasing 5.5 jin of coal briquettes for 3 jiao in national currency each time. The fair-priced sales locations will be arranged by the 23rd of this month. As for other procedures, they are the same as in the previous phase.</p>
<p>In addition to the fair-priced sales, fair-priced coal briquettes were reported that Yitaixing, Jinghua, and Yuanfeng coal briquette factories decided to set up six fair-priced coal briquette sales points in poor areas on their own initiative, starting from the 21st of this month. Sales will begin at 10:00 AM every day and end at 12:00 PM. Each person is limited to purchasing one lot, with prices of 3 yuan, with 15 jin, 2 yuan for 30 jin, and 3 yuan for 45 jin (market jin). Customers must pick up the coal themselves and delivery is not provided. The addresses have been determined as follows: (1) Guanghua Yiji Coal Briquette Store, 390 Route Lafayette, (2) Xinchang Yiji Coal Briquette Store, 393 Rue Amiral Courbet, (3) Yitaixing Retail Department, 380 Rue Cardinal Mercier, (The coal briquettes for the above three locations are all supplied by Yitaixing) (4) Jinghua Coal Briquette Warehouse, 358 Wenlin Road, (5) Jinghua Retail Department, 565 Dapuqiao, (The above two locations are supplied by Jinghua Factory itself), (6) Yuanfeng Coal Briquette Factory Retail Department, 1 Lane 1, 356 Rue Culty, (Supplied by Yuanfeng Factory itself).</p>
<p>Hot Water Coal Starting Sale on the 22nd</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association recently decided to supply members of the Hot Water Industry Association with fair-priced coal briquettes. The association, recognizing that coal is an indispensable item for each hot water shop every day, and that each hot water shop is a small business that has been affected by the rising coal prices, with a small number have been forced to stop selling water, which has a close relationship with all aspects of society, fire accidents will inevitably occur.

<h3 id="e75">Yesterday Afternoon on North Zhejiang Road, Police Confronted Robbers, Two Robbers Shot and Captured on the Spot, Stray Bullets Killed and Wounded Passersby, Three Robbery Cases Occurred Within Two Hours <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>In the area of North Henan Road, Haining Road, in the Public Concession, three major robbery cases suddenly occurred between yesterday morning and 12:00 PM. The robbers resisted arrest, resulting in a major confrontation. Stray bullets flew everywhere, killing one passerby. Details of each incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Lu Liankui's Home Suddenly Looted</p>
<p>No. 5 Tailai Lane, Haining Road, is the residence of the concubine of the late Chinese Inspector of the Public Concession Police Department, Lu Liankui. The house is three stories high and she resides in the left wing room on the ground floor. At 10:45 AM yesterday, four robbers suddenly broke into her home through the back door. They immediately pulled out guns and first confined the guests in the house, regardless of gender or status, in the right wing room downstairs, assigning one robber to guard the door and prevent them from making any noise. The remaining robbers then first broke into Lu's room, rummaging through boxes and chests, looting at will. After they had finished looting, they went upstairs and robbed the rooms of the tenants surnamed Qin, Li, and Yan, leaving nothing behind. After about an hour and a half, they took the loot and fled through the back door. The victim cautiously went outside to investigate, but the robbers were nowhere to be found. She then reported to the Huizhou Road Police Station for investigation. The estimated value of the jewelry and cash stolen is over 20,000 yuan. When reporters rushed to the scene to interview, the people inside looked distressed. Lu's room was in disarray, with items scattered on the ground.</p>
<p>Zhou from Wu Chang Ji Hao Suffers</p>
<p>Taiyuan Lane and Tailai Lane on Haining Road face each other. No. 17 in the lane is the residence of the former Shanghai celebrity Wang Xiaolai, with five floors and five basements. It is now rented out to several tenants, including silk firms and Shenzhuang (cotton shop). Among them, Wu Chang Ji Silk Company is located in the middle building. The scale is large, and the goods are piled up. A large number of female workers are employed. Unexpectedly, at 11:45 AM yesterday, Mr. Zhou from a colleague company had just withdrawn 2,500 yuan in French currency from the bank, wrapped in newspaper and tucked under his arm. He hired a rickshaw to the entrance of Taiyuan Lane. As he slowly stepped into the courtyard of No. 17 and walked down the corridor, three people suddenly rushed out from behind, stepped forward quickly, showed their guns, and forbade him from making any noise. They snatched the package of French currency from under his arm and ran away. The victim reported to the police station for investigation. Afterwards, Mr. Zhou told people that after he left the bank, he was afraid of the inconvenience of walking along the way, so he took a streetcar instead. Who knew that he would be discovered by the robbers, followed, and suffer this unfortunate event.</p>
<p>Chen, a Doctor of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Suffers Losses</p>
<p>Chen Yuming, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine specializing in pediatrics from Danyang, in his forties, has been renting a place for years at No. 54 Jingxing Lane, north of the Tianhou Palace Bridge on North Henan Road. At around 11:20 AM yesterday, a strong man in a long black robe suddenly entered the clinic, claiming to seek treatment for a throat ailment from Dr. Chen. The receptionist, Dong Fakang (age 24, from Ningbo), replied that they only treat pediatrics here and that throat ailments are not their specialty. Before he could finish speaking, the strong man pulled out a gun and threatened everyone in the room, forbidding them from making any noise. At this time, four more people walked in from outside the door. Two of them also showed their guns. One robber guarded the main door, and another stood upright next to the staircase. The remaining three robbers then walked into Chen's clinic, first cutting the telephone line and forcing Chen Yuming to</p>
<p>Hand Over Valuables</p>
<p>Since there was nothing of value in the clinic, they only stole about 30 yuan in French currency from the drawer. The robbers, unsatisfied, went upstairs. The door to the Yan family's room in the living room was tightly closed, so they were spared. They then turned into the Chen and Cheng families' rooms in the front and rear wings. After about half an hour, they only stole about 30 yuan in French currency before fleeing downstairs, along with the two robbers guarding the door. At this time, a tea boy named Wang Xihe (age 20, from Danyang) was exceptionally alert. Seeing the robbers fleeing through the back door, he walked out of the front door,</p>
<p>Following Behind Them</p>
<p>After the robbers left the door, they walked out of the north street of Jingxing Lane and headed west on Qipu Road. Wang followed closely. However, one of the five robbers had already gone in another direction. The remaining robbers hired a car at the Tailai Auto Shop across from the Special Court on North Zhejiang Road, claiming to be going somewhere in western Shanghai. The cashier ordered the driver Zhang Fenggang (age 40, from Yangzhou) to drive a business car parked on the side of the road, license plate number 2782. Three robbers sat in the car, and one robber sat in the front, side by side with the driver. At this time, several Chinese police officers from the Special Zone Court diagonally opposite were standing guard at the gate. Wang suddenly</p>
<p>Came up with an idea and went forward to report, saying that the passengers in the car were all robbers. Upon hearing the report, three police officers rushed over, surrounding the car with their guns. One police officer stood in front of the Mingxing Barber Shop across from the Tailai Auto Shop, one police officer hid behind car number 27672, and another police officer stood by the cashier's desk in the auto shop, ordering the driver to stop and telling him to get out of the car and avoid the danger. At that time, the robbers in the car, seeing that their plan had been exposed, all pulled out their guns. One robber in the front of the car threatened the driver, telling him not to get out of the car. The robbers, seeing that the situation was tense, swarmed out. The robbers were the first to open fire to resist arrest, and the police also drew their guns and opened fire.</p>
<p>Bullets Flew Everywhere</p>
<p>For more than ten shots. At this time, a Western police officer named Peter also heard the alarm and rushed to join the battle. Two robbers were shot, wounded, and captured. They were sent to the police hospital. The other two robbers managed to escape without a trace. Two other pedestrians, about fourteen or fifteen years old, one of whom was hit in the head by a stray bullet, causing his brain to spill out. He collapsed next to the counter of the Wang Shunxing Coffin Shop at No. 204 North Zhejiang Road, covered in blood, on the verge of death. He was sent to the police hospital by the police, but died despite treatment. Another pedestrian named Lu Yuanyuan, from Tongzhou, was shot in the right waist.</p>
<p>Seriously Injured and Transported to Baolong Hospital for Treatment. During the confrontation, Western police officer Peter was also grazed in the leg by a bullet. Fortunately, the injury was minor. After being bandaged by the police hospital doctor, he was immediately discharged. Upon hearing the report, the head of the Huizhou Road Police Station was furious that three robbery cases had occurred in quick succession within two hours. He immediately ordered Chinese Detective Shang Wu to lead Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene of the incident to investigate. They saw bullet marks all over the car and found some of the stolen goods and pistols next to the injured robbers, which were taken back for filing and investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Japanese Soldiers Detain Russian Police Officers at the Iron Gate on Xinqiao Street, French Concession, Caused by Interference in a Chinese Passing Through the Iron Gate, Two Russian and Vietnamese Police Officers Detained for One Hour Before Being Released <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Around 2:00 PM yesterday, a Chinese person passed through the iron gate at the intersection of Min Guo Road and Zilaihuo Street East in the French Concession, intending to go to Nanshi. As soon as he exited the iron gate, he violated a police regulation. The Vietnamese police officer stationed at the iron gate stepped forward to reprimand him. The Chinese person was stubborn and refused to comply. The military police on the opposite side saw this and stepped forward to intervene, leading to a fight. A Russian police officer who was standing nearby saw this and rushed to assist the Vietnamese police officer. Unexpectedly, he was seen by the remaining military police, who rushed forward and dragged the two Vietnamese and Russian police officers from the French Police Station into the military police headquarters stationed on the Chinese side of the border, detaining them and preventing them from leaving. The French Concession patrol officer at the scene then telephoned the French Police Station and dispatched a Western detective proficient in Japanese to negotiate with their superiors. At that time, a guard of honor armed to bid farewell to the departing French army commander was passing by and resting, causing hundreds of people to stop and watch along the road, spreading rumors and creating a tense situation. After an hour of negotiation, the two detained Vietnamese and Russian police officers were released and regained their freedom. The dispute ended and the onlookers dispersed.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Parricide and Incest Case: Request for Re-Examination; Dissatisfaction Expressed with Initial Examination; Case to be Heard for a Second Time <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The sensational parricide and incest case of the unfilial son Zhou Qinji and Qinxiang, after being sentenced to death by the Special First Court, and their mother Zhou Jing sentenced to two years and six months for assisting in the destruction of the body, Zhou and others were dissatisfied with the verdict. They retained three lawyers, Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, and Yang Sicheng, while Zhou Jing retained lawyers Jiang Pingfan and Jiang Baoli, to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court. After one hearing, the appellants expressed dissatisfaction with the forensic examination regarding whether Zhou Qinji and others had hereditary mental illness. They requested a re-examination, and the application was submitted to the Second Branch of the High Court yesterday morning by the appellants' representative lawyers. The application stated that regarding the question of whether Zhou Qinji and others suffered from mental derangement or mental weakness, the defense learned after reviewing the files that the court had already appointed Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan to jointly conduct an examination. The court had informed Wei the main points of the examination, namely whether the appellants Zhou Qinji and others suffered from the two types of mental illness, mental derangement and mental weakness. The content of the examination report was divided into four sections, and the main points of the examination were not separately stated. Therefore, the report was vague and unclear as to which was mental derangement and which was mental weakness.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Examination Report <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The first section stated that the defendants (referring to the appellants) were examined in the detention room of the police station. When questioned about the case, their answers were consistent with their confessions. Their speech and thoughts were clear and orderly. According to the detectives, the defendants behaved normally in the detention room, with normal diet and living habits, and no abnormal or uneasy behavior was observed. Regarding the defendants' academic history, a letter from Nanyang Middle School stated that the defendants studied at the school for five years, from September of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933) to June of the 27th year of the Republic (1938). Their character was generally acceptable, and their academic performance was barely passing, but their physical condition was not very healthy. The second section stated that their physical examination showed poor nutrition, medium development, no abnormal physical appearance, and no significant abnormalities in various neurological responses. However, Zhou Qinji's knee-jerk reaction was slightly more pronounced than his brother's, but without any pathological signs. The third section stated that, based on the examination results, the defendants' mental state showed no changes. They were fully oriented during questioning, with good memory and comprehension, and no mental confusion or disorientation. The examining location and method were inappropriate and essential symptoms of mental illness were not checked. Therefore the conclusion reached was somewhat of mental weakness but could not be regarded as complete.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Reasons for Dissatisfaction <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>(1) "Inappropriate examination location": The examination of the appellants took place in the detention room, where they were under special surveillance by detectives, which is equivalent to a prison where freedom is deprived. The examination of mental illness is a difficult subject in medicine, and without a suitable location, the patient's temperament and symptoms cannot be discovered, and it is difficult to make a definitive diagnosis. Therefore, Article 190, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law stipulates that "if necessary for the examination of the defendant's mental or physical condition, the defendant may be sent to a hospital or other suitable location for a predetermined period," which indicates that the examination of mental condition is predicated on allowing the defendant to express their nature. A detention room adopts a deterrent approach, and the mental abnormalities of criminals are concealed or masked by deterrence. How can mental abnormalities be discovered in such a situation? It is like asking a mouse to jump in front of a cat or a tiger to fight in front of a lion. It is not that the mouse does not want to jump, but it is afraid of the cat's power. It is not that the tiger cannot fight, but it is afraid of the lion's power. Therefore, the defense believes that using the detention room as the location for the mental examination of the appellants will inevitably lead to errors in the examination results. (2) "Inappropriate examination method": Criminology also states that it is often difficult to observe the temperament of criminals because humans have a natural tendency to keep their emotions secret, especially regarding their shortcomings, weaknesses, or misdeeds. Whether they are first-time offenders or repeat offenders, they try their best to avoid revealing them. Therefore, the examination of a criminal's mental state requires experts with in-depth knowledge of psychology and pathology to accurately determine whether they have lost or weakened their mental capacity. (3) "Essential symptoms of mental disorder were not examined completely." (Omitted) (4) Examiner Zhang Yan did not submit a report. The examination process and its results should be reported by the examiners orally or in writing. When there are multiple examiners, they may submit a joint report, but if they have different opinions, they should submit separate reports. In this case, there were two examiners, but only forensic doctor Wei submitted a report. Zhang Yan did not co-sign the report or submit a separate report, which violates Article 93 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Based on the above, it is requested that the court carefully examine the matter and promptly appoint mental health experts to conduct another examination in accordance with the law to ensure thoroughness. Doctors Yuan Junchang and Han Fen in this city are highly knowledgeable in neurology and are willing to participate in the examination free of charge. If they are asked to conduct a joint examination, it will undoubtedly yield unexpected gains regarding the causes and effects of the criminal behavior. It is reported that this case will soon be heard for a second time by Judge Nie Chongyi of the Second Branch of the High Court in a collegial panel.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Elderly Man, Burdened by Poverty and Illness, Plunges to His Death in the Early Morning; Jumped from the Fifth Floor, Skull Fractured; Suicide Note Addressed to Yu Zuoting and Others <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 5:00 AM, a tragic incident occurred at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Yu Qiaqing Road, where an elderly man plunged to his death. The deceased was Yu Shunqing, a cousin of the former chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Yu Zuoting. Yu, over sixty years old, was from Zhenhai, Zhejiang. He came to Shanghai after the August 13th Incident. Initially, he lived at the Qianji Hotel. Due to financial difficulties, his cousin Yu Zuoting introduced him to the dormitory on the fifth floor of the Ningbo Native Place Association. The reason for the suicide was attributed to poverty and illness.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Summary of Chairman Fan Keling's Speech at the Annual Meeting (Part 3) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>This Year's Budget</p>
<p>The 1940 budget has been distributed to everyone for review, and detailed explanations are attached. Therefore, I only need to highlight a few key points. The estimated expenditure for this year, including projects carried over from the previous year, totals approximately 47,476,970 yuan. On the revenue side, based on the current tax rates, it is estimated to be 35,142,150 yuan, resulting in a shortfall of 12,334,820 yuan. After repeated consideration, the General Bureau decided to uniformly increase the surcharges by 50% on all current tax rates, starting from July 1st of this year. At the same time, the surcharges on various license fees will be increased from 10% to 50% to supplement the revenue. Even with the approval of this surcharge, the estimated deficit for this year remains substantial.</p>
<p>In the past, during each discussion of tax increases, the bureau was questioned about the use of the huge sum of 81 million taels of silver from the sale of the electricity department, as if the money had been completely wasted. It was suggested that the bureau should have considered the financial situation earlier. When the bureau sold the electricity department, its debt amounted to approximately 46 million taels of silver and 75 million pounds in foreign currency. The sale price of 81 million taels was to be paid in five years. The use of this income was stipulated to be primarily for repaying old debts, with any remaining funds allocated to finance important facilities. The loan of 75 million pounds was originally scheduled to be repaid in 1950, but due to the proceeds from the sale of the electricity department, it was repaid in 1930. Converting it to taels of silver, the amount paid was approximately 6.5 million taels. If this loan had been extended to today, it would be worth approximately 45 million yuan at the current exchange rate, plus annual interest, etc., totaling approximately 3.5 million yuan.</p>
<p>As of the end of 1933, approximately 47.5 million taels of the proceeds from the sale had been used to repay debts, and approximately 29.5 million taels had been used for temporary expenses such as land acquisition, construction, and road building. The remaining amount of approximately 4 million taels was transferred to the "Debt Temporary Account" as a debt repayment fund. Subsequently, the bureau's financial situation deteriorated, and it had to change the original debt repayment and fund deposit plans. As a result, approximately 8 million yuan from the "Debt Temporary Account" was transferred to cover the budget shortfall for current expenses, and the remaining 4 million yuan was transferred to the general reserve fund. Since 1932, the general reserve fund has been frequently used to supplement the budget for current expenses. As of last year, approximately 11 million yuan had been withdrawn from the reserve fund, leaving very little available for use. As a result of selling the electricity department ten years ago, the bureau was able to initiate reforms and expansions in public security and education. Over the past ten years, the benefits to taxpayers have been significant. The facts are clear and undeniable.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Fake Police Colluding with Gangsters, Extorting "Protection Fees"; Goods Transported from Nanshi into the Concession Threatened and Extorted <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that trucks transporting goods from Nanshi into the French Concession were frequently subjected to extortion of "protection fees" by gangsters before being allowed to pass. These gangsters would surround trucks carrying goods from Nanshi and force the drivers and coolies into nearby teahouses to start negotiations and extort "protection fees," sometimes as high as 70% of the value of the goods. They would threaten to damage the goods. It is rumored that "Avenue" police in Nanshi are colluding with these gangsters, with the "Avenue" police also entering the teahouses to participate in the negotiations and share the spoils. Those who purchase goods in Nanshi and transport them out are required to obtain permits from the Japanese authorities, but the gangsters avoid the eyes and ears of the Japanese when extorting, disregarding the permits. To avoid losing their goods, transporters generally pay a certain amount to ensure safe passage.</p>
<p>A Miserable Late Life</p>
<p>When Yu was young, he engaged in the flour business and traveled to various provinces in the interior to investigate coal and oil industries. After the August 13th Incident, he came to Shanghai alone and resided at the Qianji Hotel to organize the China Petroleum Industry Promotion Society, soliciting support from various parties. Shanghai gentry and businessmen such as Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, and Xu Jiqing were listed as founders or sponsors. However, funds eventually ran out, and with the rising cost of living in Shanghai, it became difficult to continue. Yu Zuoting introduced him to reside in the dormitory of the Native Place Association to reduce expenses, with Zuoting paying the accommodation fees. His old illness often recurred. Lin Kanghou also sympathized with his plight in his later years and arranged for doctors and medicine for him for two months. Other necessities were provided by friends from time to time.</p>
<p>Suicide by Jumping</p>
<p>Although Yu took medicine and injections intermittently, his old age and frailty made it difficult to regain his health. According to the doctor, his heart and blood were exhausted. In recent months, he had been bedridden, and his illness worsened. He often lamented his fate. The day before his death, a friend sent someone to bring him money, but he sighed and said, "I am about to die, what is the use of money?" and asked the person to take it back, suggesting that he already had suicidal thoughts. In the early morning of the 19th, he took advantage of the lack of vigilance and tragically jumped to his death. It was not until dawn that passersby discovered him and reported it to the nearby Lao Zha Police Station for investigation. An ambulance was summoned to take him to the Longhua Hospital for emergency treatment, but he died from a fractured skull due to the fall from the fifth floor, and the treatment was unsuccessful. He was then transferred for a post-mortem examination. In Shanghai, in addition to his cousin Yu Zuoting, he also had a younger cousin Yu Songqing. The deceased's suicide note was addressed to Yu Zuoting, Lin Kanghou, and others, and was taken to the police station for investigation. It is reported that the deceased has a daughter living with her mother in Tianjin.</p>
<p>A Brief Biography of the Deceased</p>
<p>Yu came to Shanghai in the 22nd year of the Guangxu Emperor (1896) and co-founded a flour company with the German company Zengyu Foreign Firm, with the factory located in Mujiazui. Yu was responsible for sales in other areas. In the 30th year of the Guangxu Emperor (1904), he was hired as the factory manager of the Youfeng Flour Mill in Zhangjiakou. In the 3rd year of the Republic (1914), he served as the treasury manager and cashier of the Hunan Bank in Changsha. In the 7th year of the Republic (1918), he served as the director of the Anti-Drug Propaganda Department of the Beiyang government, compiling a booklet titled "Eradicate Drugs Completely." Subsequently, he traveled to Fengtian, Jilin, Shanxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces, investigating coal and oil industries. In the 19th year of the Republic (1930), he organized the National Coal Production and Sales Association in Shanghai to promote the use of national coal, which was strongly supported by Lin Kanghou, the chairman of the National Chamber of Commerce Federation. He submitted a petition to various central government departments and provincial authorities, advocating for the use of national coal to protect national interests. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), he successfully developed petroleum, which made him very happy. After the August 13th Incident, he came to Shanghai to organize the Petroleum Industry Promotion Society.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, The news column in today's newspaper contains a report about the dispute between Wang Fuji Nail Factory and our company, which contains many inaccuracies. Commission agents do not have legal authority. Our company's sales contracts are always signed by myself, and I am responsible for any disputes that arise. The Wang Fuji Nail Factory order could not be shipped due to the outbreak of the European war, and there is documentary evidence to prove this. It is not an empty accusation. Liu Tonggui was a salesman in our company and left for personal reasons. He has never been a commission agent. His testimony is nothing but malicious revenge. Please check and correct this. Sincerely, Luo Ming, Legal Representative of the Belgian-Chinese Hualong Foreign Firm, April 19, 1940.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: The HSBC price remained unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American exchange rates was relatively dull. Firstly, speculation was not enthusiastic. Secondly, there were no new stimuli in the environment. Operators took very stable steps. Therefore, there were mainly arbitrage transactions. Initially, the exchange rate rebounded slightly. After opening, the US exchange rate was 6 yuan, and the British exchange rate remained unchanged. Subsequently, as foreign firms expressed a desire to sell, the market remained relaxed. Later, Chinese and foreign firms engaged in opening-milling transactions. At noon, speculators suddenly became interested in buying, and the price slowly softened. The afternoon market was sluggish, with little attention. The forward US exchange rate was also soft. The spot price and the May contract differed by as much as 2.5 to 2.8125 jiao. Those who held spot cash became active and offered forward discounts, reaching more than four points per month (calculated for 40 days).</p>
<p>American Banks Continuously Supplied</p>
<p>Initially, the London rate fell 0.0625, but it quickly recovered. The New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London raw silver remained stable. The exchange rates of British against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. US against British rose 1.875 points, against Shanghai rose 5 points, and against French rose 75 points. The central price remained unchanged. Banks opened with a spot price of British at 4 shillings and 125 points, and US at 6 yuan, which was the same as the closing price yesterday. This caused the exchange rate to recover. After opening, foreign and American banks were eager to sell, so the market remained flat, even though foreign firms were settling with Dutch and other foreign firms. The HSBC price remained unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced to be reduced by 0.50. Thereafter, Chinese firms engaged in slight arbitrage transactions. It was estimated that American banks sold spot US to speculators at 6 yuan, and foreign firms entered into May US contracts with Chinese firms at 5.71875 and 75 jiao. At noon, speculators bought back April US from foreign firms at a price of 5.875 yuan, and May at 5.6875 yuan. The midday situation continued to recover to a flat level. As a result, British closed at 4 shillings and 125 points, and US closed at 6 yuan, similar to the opening price.</p>
<p>May US Exchange Rate Particularly Tight</p>
<p>The afternoon initially opened with a particularly stable situation. Very few opening transactions were done. It was only reported that speculators bought back the May US exchange rate at 5.65625 yuan. Besides this, foreign firms were the only ones trading amongst themselves, with the May US exchange rate also at 5.65625 yuan. However, the May US exchange rate was slightly tight at times. Until the evening close, there were no changes. As a result, the spot price of British was 4 shillings and 125 points, and US was 6 yuan. The April price of British was 4 shillings 046875 points, and US was 5.875 yuan. The May price of British was 3 shillings 890625 points, and US was 5.625 yuan. Compared with the closing price last night, the spot price of British was unchanged, US was down 0.02125 jiao, April British was up 0.015625 jiao, US was unchanged, and May British was also up 0.015625 jiao, while US was down 0.03125 jiao.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Exchange Rate Eased</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 19th (Friday): This morning's closing price opened flat. British and Chinese exchange rates were unchanged. The spot price of US eased 0.065 to 21.6875 yuan. The forward price opened at 21.5625 yuan. The spot price of Japanese currency rose by half a round to 93 national yuan. At 11:30 AM, the price was flat. At 2:30 PM, the market opened steadily, and all exchange rates remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and US Currencies Both Shrunk</p>
<p>Tianjin, 19th (Friday): The exchange market opened sluggishly this morning. The spot price of British currency continued to tighten by 0.03125 to 2 shillings and 78125 points. The spot price of US currency also shrank by 0.03125 to 5.46875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate continued to rise by 1 yuan to 108.75 yuan.

<h3 id="e89">Gold Market Trends Show Instability, But Fluctuations Remain Small <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot raw gold market was unstable, with fluctuating prices and a narrow trading range. This was due to the weakening exchange rate and an unfavorable environment for bullish sentiment, leading to potential price suppression. However, market sentiment remained buoyant, and buying interest could easily emerge, driving prices up. Initially, the exchange rate showed slight fluctuations, and operators adopted a wait-and-see approach, causing the opening price to drop by $27 to $5,800. Although it later rose by over $20, banks suddenly rushed to sell, and despite some absorption, the market still felt oversupplied, causing the price to fall below the $5,800 level, reaching a low of $5,775 for the day. Subsequently, with purchases from gold firms and securities houses, the price recovered above $5,800 by noon. In the afternoon, the exchange rate also stabilized, improving market sentiment. The opening price jumped to $5,830, but briefly fell by over $10. Ultimately, with continued aggressive buying from securities houses, the price rose to $5,840. However, a certain securities house then sold off, and money changers also sold off a significant amount, causing the price to fall to $5,805. The closing price was $5,806, down $21 from the previous day. Trading volume was light, estimated at over 3,000 taels. Gold jewelry shops quoted a $5 decrease. Customs gold and other types remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Falls by $21</p>
<p>From the morning, the exchange rate was high for each bar (ten taels), and market sentiment was slightly weak. The opening price dropped $27 as money changers sold gold to gold firms at $5,800. Subsequently, with a surge in buyers, money changers, banks, and others rushed to buy, while sellers became scarce, causing the price to rebound by $25. Banks sold 50 taels to securities houses at $5,825. Thereafter, a certain bank suddenly sold aggressively, and securities houses and money changers also switched from buying to selling, resulting in an immediate feeling of ample supply. Before long, the price broke through the $5,800 level. At this point, even floating long positions rushed to close, further increasing the sense of oversupply, and the price fell by another $20. Banks traded 30 taels among themselves, declining to $5,777. At that time, a certain gold firm took advantage of the low price to buy, immediately rebounding by $13. Gold firms sold 50 taels to banks at $5,790. However, with banks selling again, the price weakened, and banks sold 20 taels to money changers, falling to $5,775. Near the close, buying interest from gold firms re-emerged, coupled with aggressive absorption from a certain securities house, and floating long positions were completely liquidated. The price then soared out of the $5,800 level. Gold firms bought 10 taels from money changers at $5,810 as the closing price for the noon session. When the afternoon session opened, sentiment was strong, and the opening price jumped $20. Banks sold 10 taels to money changers at $5,830. Subsequently, a certain securities house came to sell high, causing a small retreat of $12. Securities houses sold 20 taels to banks at $5,818. However, securities houses then aggressively bought, and gold firms took the opportunity to raise prices, rebounding by $22. Banks sold 30 taels to money changers at $5,840. Afterwards, money changers and securities houses suddenly switched from buying to selling, gradually falling by $35. Banks sold 10 taels to money changers at $5,805. Then, gold firms did counter-trading of 10 taels at $5,806 as the closing price for the evening session. As a result, the price fell by $21 compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of $65 for the entire day. The selling price of spot gold from cash firms was several dollars higher than raw gold, while the purchase price was $20 lower. The current bid price for gold was over $50 lower than the listed price, with little active trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Down $5</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael from the major goldsmiths initially remained at $590. But at 9:45 AM, it decreased $5. After that there was no change. Ultimately, the major goldsmiths revised the price to $585. The price of the new goldsmiths was the same as the above price. The purchase price was about $15 lower.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Foreign Currency Demand Greatly Reduced <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currency weakened again, and trading volume decreased significantly. The key issue was the rise in foreign stocks, leading many people to sell foreign exchange and transfer funds into foreign stocks. The market saw a slight weakening of British and American gold pounds, while the US dollar exchange rate fluctuated, hovering between $16.61 and $16.55. The lowest price in the evening session was down $0.06 from the previous day. The French franc was weak. Hong Kong dollar supply and demand were relatively balanced. The Philippine peso was sluggish. However, there was still demand for British gold notes, and the market price rose. Japanese banknotes remained weak, with the former falling to $1.305 and the latter sharply declining to $1.035. The rest remained stable.</p>
<h3 id="e91">New Aluminum Fractional Currency – Second Batch Issued Yesterday – <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>After the first batch of $280,000 in newly issued aluminum fractional currency was released, it saw little circulation in the market due to high collection demand. The second batch was issued yesterday, restricted to use by banks and money-related businesses. On the Chinese banks’ side, the Banks Association has entrusted the Bank Preparation Committee to distribute the currency at their discretion. The preparation committee has determined the amounts that each bank can receive, and it has sent letters to the banks notifying them of their allocations. Each bank can receive either 10,000 coins each of one-cent and one-fractional-cent coins, or 20,000 coins total. The association has also requested that the banks distribute the aluminum fractional currency to shops and households as much as possible to stimulate circulation. Going forward, each bank can receive one batch per week. It’s said the weight of each bag of one-fractional-cent coins, containing 10,000 coins (i.e., $100), is approximately 14 and 56/100 pounds.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Securities, Wheelock Shares Up to $227 <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The securities unofficial market showed a trend of consolidation yesterday, and the market was sluggish. Bullish players were reluctant to act due to tight credit, while bearish players were unwilling to cover their positions due to the favorable environment. Large institutional investors had yet to enter the market, so the market was in a state of stagnation due to mutual restraint. Trading was light. Both buyers and sellers were very inactive yesterday. Only Hong Kong Land saw some buying in the morning, and No. 38 saw some selling. The rest of the trading was mainly done by retail investors. In the afternoon, No. 38 continued to sell, and No. 7 and Ewo also sought to sell. No. 8, No. 20, Hutchison, and Allied Brick &amp; Tile saw some covering, but they seemed hesitant. As a result, Class A and Class C maintained their original prices, while the rest fell slightly by $0.05 or $0.10. The total trading volume was estimated at over $400,000. A simplified table is provided below:</p>
<p>Class  Highest  Lowest  Closing  Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Class A 59.20 59.35 59.50 Even</p>
<p>Class B 51.15 51.00 51.05 Down 0.05</p>
<p>Class C 49.10 48.95 49.05 Even</p>
<p>Class D 48.75 48.60 48.65 Down 0.05</p>
<p>Class E 50.10 49.90 49.95 Down 0.10</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Ningbo and Hebian Jiji Factory were traded at a price of $185 per share.</p>
<p>The public industrial stock market remained very active, with astonishing price fluctuations and extremely large trading volumes. Fortunately, profit-taking helped to curb the rise; otherwise, the consequences would have been unimaginable. At the close, the selling side ran out of shares, and prices rose sharply, with many stocks hitting record highs. Wheelock led the way, rising by as much as $30 in one day, closing at $227 bid, with no sellers. Jardine Matheson shares were in high demand, and although there was some profit-taking, they still rose by $6, closing at $53.50 bid, $54 offer. Trading volume was over 56,000 shares. Steel shares looked promising, with 33,000 shares traded, closing at $39.50 bid. Other industrial shares were lackluster. Rubber shares opened lively and firm, but trading gradually decreased over time, and public interest almost entirely shifted to industrial shares.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Thursday) Dispatch: Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt were generally stable. Only the Reorganization Loan Central Bank Notes continued to fall by £1, to £37. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Yarn and Cotton, Base Price Too High, Many Long Positions in Cotton Yarn Liquidated <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market shifted from high to low, but the situation remained tight due to the lack of spot goods, keeping the base price high. Although Hong Kong buyers were strong, their purchases were not as large as before, and some were adopting a wait-and-see approach due to the already high base price.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning, continuing the enthusiastic momentum from the previous day. 20-count Double Horse spot was offered at $1,440, and mill orders were priced at $1,410, up $18. As prices were high and the exchange rate weakened, those taking profits liquidated positions, and market prices quickly declined. Double Horse spot fell back to $1,395, and mill orders were priced at $1,375. Subsequently, long positions became active again, recovering to $1,400, and mill orders were priced at $1,384. It is estimated that 1,850 bales were traded in the first half of the day, with the price of 20-count Double Horse spot unchanged. Today, 10 bales of yarn were shipped to Siam, 200 bales to Saigon, 1,632 bales to Hong Kong, and 65 bales to Xiamen. The amounts purchased by various traders are listed below: Local firms 1,610, Xiamen 50, Hong Kong 190. Total 1,850.</p>
<p>Afternoon News: 20-count Double Horse spot was priced at $1,400, with buyers, similar to the morning closing price, slightly higher. But the momentum was more moderate, not as strong as the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e94">US Freight Rates Will Increase, Indian Cotton Trading Particularly Strong <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Indian cotton trading was particularly active, while native cotton business was very slow. Factories had some demand, but most transactions were between traders, so prices were flat. The details of spot cotton transactions are listed below:</p>
<p>Pengjiapu 151.50, Xinsheng Huai 100 bales</p>
<p>Urmula 237.00, Xinsheng Jin 300 bales</p>
<p>Pingguoer 201.00, Trader Jin 100 bales</p>

<p>Pingguoer 194.00, De Feng Jin 100 bales</p>
<p>Grass Bag 27.00, Trader Jin 27 bales</p>
<p>Other Foreign Cotton News: The New York cotton market was very quiet yesterday, but quite firm. Later, due to purchases in Wall Street and some short covering, the closing market was firm, with nearby contracts up 1-2 points and distant contracts down 2-3 points compared to the previous day. The Indian market was quiet, and the forecast was largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: The market was quite active, but the majority of transactions were spot trades. This was because the European situation was becoming increasingly serious, and fewer overseas ships were coming to China. Furthermore, yesterday's report stated that US freight rates would increase again, and the supply of long-staple raw cotton from India was very limited. Therefore, 32-count to 42-count raw cotton had to be sourced from the US or Brazil. There were many transactions in long-staple cotton yesterday, with some prices reaching as high as $297-298. However, this was still over $10 cheaper than the foreign firms' quoted prices. The factory delivery prices converted at a US dollar exchange rate of $5.9375 are as follows:</p>
<p>20-count US Mitterling 296.75</p>
<p>20-count US Sub-grade 287.00</p>
<p>32-count Also 313.20</p>
<p>32-count Also Sub-grade 304.80</p>
<p>42-count Also 316.00</p>
<p>41-count Also Sub-grade 306.70</p>
<h3 id="e95">Food, Southern and Northern Japonica Rice Arriving Continuously <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was tight at first, then weak. The early market was particularly bleak, with prices increasing by $0.50 to $0.70-0.80 across the board. For example, No. 1 Saigon opened at $47.80, and Small Grain opened at $43.80, but there was little actual demand, with most transactions being speculative. As a result, the market mood quickly eased and gradually weakened, falling all the way back to its original level at the close, similar to the previous market.</p>
<p>Only one or two thousand bags of Siam rice were transferred from Dachang Company in Hongkou, and the prices offered were not much different. The source of Lower Village Japonica rice is still strong, but it is subject to control by a certain party. Rice from the north, such as rice from Changshu and Wuxi, is arriving continuously, all exclusively sold and managed by Dachang Company. It is stored in the first and second godowns along the inner river, and transported by truck and barge, both on land and water, into the Shanghai International Settlement. Rice from Nanlu and Paitung is also intercepted by a certain party in Nanshi and a company formed by rice merchants, forcing them to sell it to them at the military rice price (i.e., 21 Japanese yen per picul). The company then resells it to various rice shops. Therefore, rice shops in Nanshi all display white cloths bearing the words "Military Certificate Rice Exchange," because a certain party uses military certificates to buy rice, resells it to the public, and then uses the rice to collect the military certificates circulating in the market.</p>
<p>Due to international pricing, the futures price of foreign rice increased yesterday due to telegrams. The May contract for No. 1 Saigon requires $63. Therefore, firms are trying to hold onto their goods, and Northern traders and large investors have already absorbed a lot of stock and are still trying to add to their positions. Speculation is rampant. The opening price in the morning immediately showed strong buying interest. The opening price for No. 2 Saigon for April and May reached $54.40, up $0.40 from the previous afternoon's closing price of $54. During noon, it was briefly suppressed by floating traders to $54, but at the afternoon close, it was pushed up to $54.45 by large investors. A total of 350 tons of futures were opened and 8,000 bags of spot foreign rice were opened.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Flour, Local and Wholesale Prices Differ by More Than $1, Stockpilers Buy Back Reclaimed Flour <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The flour market continued to be firm, and actual sales on the local market were flat. However, the wholesale price remained high at $15, differing by more than $1 from the local wholesale price. Therefore, stockpilers were considering buying back reclaimed warehouse order flour. The asking price for old car brands was already higher than the factory price, but buyers were only offering $13.77-78, causing sellers to temporarily hold back. It was heard that a few hundred bags of goods in transit were sold later at a price of $13.75. Other mainland Japanese factory flours were mediocre due to sluggish sales. The market environment did not show any special developments. 500 bags of flour will be shipped to Xiamen on the 20th.</p>
<p>Wheat trading remained stagnant yesterday because merchants believed that with the increase in flour prices, the cost of raw materials would also have to increase. However, Chinese factories were trying to suppress prices. Therefore, the prices of small batches of wheat delivered to factories, such as wheat from Changzhou and Wuxi, were often disputed, or the price was set one or two days after delivery. This was not a normal market. As of yesterday, the selling price of Suzhou white wheat had to be above $21, but there were no formal transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Sugar Market, Foreign Sugar Stable <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The sugar market remained firm yesterday. The association's designated prices for spot goods were: 24 raw white sugar, local warehouses, $64.80, unchanged; new goods, external warehouses, $64.65-$64.70, up $0.20; old goods, $64.50-$64.40, up $0.40-0.50; transit goods still $51.40. Taikoo White Sugar, 4 warehouses: B mark $71.60, CW mark $71.30, up $0.10; CX mark $71.00, DY mark $70.70, HX mark $70.50, all up $0.30. H Tong Che Raw sugar $50.50; Dutch raw sugar spot $53.50, transit $44.60, no change. Local soft white and No. 1 rock sugar were unchanged. It was heard that a certain party's X factory offered 15,000 bags of white sugar, with negotiable prices. In the domestic sugar market, a Cantonese trader offered over 200 bags of Dongxiang raw sugar at $43; Jian trader offered Diaozing at $51.50, up $0.50.</p>

<p>Recently, the price of coal briquettes has increased across the board, but charcoal has gone against the trend. Although it was expensive earlier, the recent influx of charcoal from Haimen and Huangshi, coupled with the end of the peak sales season, has caused the charcoal market to become oversupplied and lack outlets. Yesterday, a large batch of Wenzhou green coal arrived, creating a downward pressure in the market. The offered price was $8 per dan, but there were few buyers. The weakness of the market is evident. However, the fact that charcoal is cheap while coal is expensive is a blessing for the people. (L)</p>
<p>The Chinese-Italian Company's Aengee Lun, carrying over 5,000 tons of white coal dust from Haiphong, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. Also, Jardine Matheson's Jeannette Shinner, managed by the foreign shipping department, carrying 7,090 tons of coal from Calcutta, India, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but there was no news of its arrival until yesterday evening. Details were noted in yesterday's newspaper. Today, it is known that the ship berthed yesterday afternoon and is currently unloading. It is estimated that the two ships brought in over 12,000 tons of white coal yesterday. Today, 1,700 cans of kerosene will be shipped to Shantou. (Zu)</p>

<p>Recently, there has been an acute shortage of cement in Shanghai. Although there has not been much construction, the demand for cement exceeds supply. The reason is that Blue Circle cement cannot be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities due to the situation in Tianjin, and the arrival of Japanese cement is restricted. The only remaining brands are Taishan from Longtan and Long Brand from Longhua, a large part of which must be supplied to a certain party for military use and to fulfill orders from the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement and the French Concession. This leaves very little available for the market, creating a situation where scarce goods are expensive. Furthermore, dealers are hoarding and raising prices. In the past half-month, the price of each paper bag has risen from $6.50 to $8.50, and traders are still hoarding and expecting further increases, refusing to sell.</p>

<p>Over ten cases of new tangerine peel recently arrived via steamer from Zhangjiakou. The pieces are thin and have a reddish color, making them top-quality. According to a letter from the owner, production and stock are already scarce, and prices have also increased, making it difficult to lower prices.</p>

<p>(From the Shun Ching Tongzhi 12th Year issue of this newspaper)</p>
<p>Sky-Gazing Telescope</p>
<p>Yesterday, a Ningbo man, about thirty years old, resembling a clerk from a foreign firm, was on a high mound in Zhiyuanbang, near the Northwest Fahua Temple in this city, holding a telescope and looking up at the sky. He muttered to himself, "The wonders of the heavenly palace are truly rare in this world!" A moment later, he said, "Lord Zhou Yuji is riding a horse and holding a long spear out of the South Heavenly Gate." The old and young men and women in the village, hearing his words, all flocked to watch. An old man asked the name of the telescope and requested to borrow it for a look. The Ningbo man said, "This is called a sky-gazing telescope, and it can see the sights of the sky. It's not that I'm unwilling to lend it, but this telescope is worth a thousand gold coins. I came to the countryside with my employer to hunt birds, and the boat is parked not far from here. I'm just sneaking away for a moment because my employer is drinking on the boat. If I lend it to you and something unexpected happens, who will bear the responsibility?" The villagers said they would be extra careful and would definitely not make a mistake. The Ningbo man reluctantly agreed. The village elder looked it over and over, but it seemed blurry and unclear. The Ningbo man told him that there was a way to look at it, and if you didn't follow the method, you should look closely as if you didn't see anything. Then he told everyone to look at it carefully according to the method, passing it back and forth, and deliberately let it slip and fall to the ground. The Ningbo man then wailed loudly, grabbing onto the villagers and refusing to let go. Afterwards, he picked it up from the ground and looked at it carefully, and then turned his sorrow into joy, saying, "Fortunately, it's not a big problem. Only a piece of the microscope is broken, and it can still be repaired in Shanghai, but it will cost twenty yuan." After repeated negotiations, they settled on twelve yuan.</p>
<p>The Python Does Not Hurt People</p>
<p>Someone named Huangshan Moujia from Su Yuan entered the mountain to collect firewood. He heard snoring like thunder in the valley. He crouched down to investigate and saw a giant python coiled between the trees. Its head was like a basket, and its eyes were like lightning. Moujia, who was always brave, threw a stone at it, but the python didn't move. Moujia wanted to take a sickle and chop at it, but he lost his footing and fell on the python. He thought he would definitely be harmed, but he was not afraid. However, looking back at the high slope, he could not climb up, so he climbed out by grasping the snake's body and clinging to the vines, and then celebrated his rebirth.</p>

<h3 id="e103">A Stroll in Wartime Berlin <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>What does wartime Berlin actually look like?</p>
<p>Since we are staying at a very good hotel, of course, we have no way of knowing the situation of the average German. Here, we can still get the best food, like fish and eggs. Even on meatless days, we can eat. In the following, please compare it with the situation in Berlin before the war.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, at breakfast, there is neither grape juice nor orange juice. All there is is just a not-so-good apple.</p>
<p>I asked the waiter in the hotel how they were doing? He told me: the salary is only half of what it was in 1932, but he feels very happy because he can keep this position, but most of his friends can't easily find such a basic position.</p>
<p>Now, let's go out on the street and take a look. We see huge posters. It is said that these things have to be changed every week, mostly depicting Chamberlain as a god of war; the press, however, likes to attack Churchill.</p>
<p>In the large storefront windows along the street, we can still see very beautiful clothes, shirts, leather gloves, etc. You can also buy these things at will. But first you have to present your "shopping record card" for inspection. Every resident living in Berlin has such a card, with a hundred small dots printed on it, valid for one year. Once, a friend of mine bought a new dress, two ties, two shirts, and two pairs of socks in one go, which cost him eighty small dots. In this year, he only has twenty dots left to buy other things. You also have to hand in your old clothes when you buy new clothes.</p>
<p>On the road, you can also often find many people wearing light blue uniforms. They are the air defense forces around Berlin. In Berlin, you don't see many German soldiers wearing green or gray uniforms. There are also people wearing dark blue clothes, most of whom are guards of the Labor Front. The cars driving on the street are all painted gray like warships, and they all now belong to the military.</p>
<p>Now we go to the town of Altona for lunch. Unfortunately, today happens to be a meatless day. There are two such days every week, but in Altona you can still have mashed yam flakes and fruit jam cakes. If you eat at an ordinary German's house, you can only taste one egg a week—and it's very difficult to eat a fish.</p>
<p>Of course, it is quite expensive to eat this meal. The cake, plus a piece of chocolate (you can't eat this anywhere else but in Altona), and a bottle of apple juice wine, cost a total of six marks and fifty尼 [pfennig].</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in the afternoon we cannot visit the largest coffee shop in the area. It is said that it is crowded with people every day - especially middle and lower-class women.</p>
<p>In the evening we had dinner at a private club, where the side dishes were quite good, but the prices were not cheap either.</p>
<p>What does wartime Berlin actually look like? After running around all day, we can roughly know something about it. (Excerpted and translated from The Christian Science Monitor)</p>

<p>— Niu Zheng</p>
<p>Spring comes stealthily, and soon it will stealthily depart. Just like cherishing my own fading youth, I have recollections and aspirations for this beautiful spring. The golden childhood, in the history of my life, can no longer write beautiful chapters, let it go! Can the ruthless years take away precious youth again?</p>
<p>In the middle of the day, or in the middle of the night, I think of the vast wilderness, a clear stream, the fisherman under the weeping willows, and the kind smile? It is already spring in the garden, I can't help but look far into the depths of the white clouds, asking about the news of the annual red apricots in my hometown, are there still people who cherish the peach petals mixed in the mud? Will the spider's web be full of beams?</p>
<p>Entrusting the spring breeze to convey my words, hometown, I deeply miss you, the former peace and well-being, the old scenery, should have been trampled to the ground! Why does the news brought back pierce the heart of the traveler again?</p>
<p>However, the land permeated with the blood of martyrs should be the most fertile, and the flowers of revolution will bloom so brightly.</p>
<p>I am watching, on the land of my hometown, a glorious flower will soon grow!</p>

<p>For most people, these days are dark and difficult days. Life is a difficult thing, and we need to use all our energy, creativity, and patience to do it. It is not easy or simple to be a person in this era. Many people are so busy with their livelihoods that they have little or no time to cultivate their spirituality. The daily struggle for bread and the necessities of life requires great courage and effort from people. In terms of larger social situations, both nationally and internationally, this struggle is even more pronounced. Economic failures have become an unbearable burden for people. In some parts of the world, the necessities of life are trampled on, while in other parts, people starve to death. The estrangement between countries is increasing, mutual suspicion is growing, and everyone is competing in armaments, believing that armaments are the only guarantee of peace, which shows that the world is full of fear and doubt. In terms of personal reorganization and experience, these are dark and difficult days. As for what the future holds, even the most confident prophets dare not predict. Since the beginning of history, today is perhaps the time when great men, strong men, and capable men are most needed. The people we need are those with strong will, not cruel and barbaric, those with compassion, not emotional. In other words, the people we need are the kind trained by Jesus Christ. The main task of religion is to cultivate such a relationship between people and the creator, so that the most beautiful personality can be produced. Jesus of Nazareth dedicated his life to this work and proved it through experimentation. Although the world did many inhuman things to him that would have made him lose trust in people, he still dared to trust people. People ridiculed him, beat him, and put him to death in the most humiliating way, a way only suitable for the most heinous criminals, but he still believed in people, believed in their latent talents. This is because he measured people according to a new standard. One should not look at what a person was like in the past, nor should one look at what they are like now. Instead, one should look at their potential achievements in the future. (To be continued) For detailed research, please send a letter to mailbox number 1227.</p>

<h3 id="e106">A Tutor's Confession <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Competition</p>
<p>Although I have now obtained a tutor position, it is not something to be envied, because this bowl of rice, worth only a dozen yuan a month, was obtained with great effort—or rather, by using up the words "trouble," "beg," and "thank you." Moreover, now that I have this job, I am beginning to feel that it is not easy to "eat"!</p>
<p>The student I am teaching is a junior high school student who is about to graduate. He—this "master" (because his "grandfather" and "grandmother" have both gone to another world, and the family is supported by their brothers, the servants call their master that way) is used to being pampered. Going to school is just a formality. He is either late or absent from school. Probably because he has been messing around for several years and the school work is too busy at graduation to deal with it easily, this led to my opportunity.</p>
<p>It's been almost a month since I started tutoring! But in these short two hours, I have never seen him not dozing off. Every night, about ten minutes after I arrive, he lazily brings the book (the "palace" has dinner very late!). Before nine o'clock, while I am still pointing at the book and explaining each item, he does not look at the book, but instead "looks around": he starts yawning gradually. His eyes are constantly looking at the clock, as if thinking, "Why is the minute hand moving so slowly?"</p>
<p>The school assigns a lot of homework every day, geometry, algebra, trigonometry... What should this "master," who is "unexplainably" skating and watching movies every day, do? Of course, with his "intelligence," he quickly came up with a "brilliant plan." However, this brilliant plan made me suffer.</p>
<p>He probably thought this way: rather than listening to me teach it once every day and still not being able to solve the problems, it's better to just let me do all the problems for him! After all, he paid for it!</p>
<p>At the beginning—at the beginning of his implementation of this "brilliant plan," he still had me solve the problems on scratch paper and then copied them into his exercise book himself. Later, he probably had "experience" and "improved" it, simply handing the problems to me and asking me to copy them directly into the book. As for himself, he either says "I have something to do and need to take leave" today, or "I have friends inviting me out" tomorrow. He doesn't come to sit for these two "imprisonment" hours for five or six days out of ten!</p>
<p>I used to teach with some interest, but now it's not only bland, but it's simply like going back to junior high school. It's simply like being a junior high school student! Using the term "teaching assistant" from university professors, I can be called this "master's" "reading assistant."</p>
<p>I really feel that this kind of tutor has no possibility of continuing. Alas, I really don't dare to accept this kind of "student"!—I can't work for a person who doesn't want to improve for this small amount of money!</p>

<h3 id="e107">Time <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng San</p>
<p>Time is the raw material of all things. With it, everything can be solved. Without it, everything is in vain. Time is much more precious than money. If you have time, you can often get money from it. Otherwise, even if you are a millionaire, you cannot spend more money than me or the cat lying next to the stove to buy one more minute.</p>
<p>The most amazing thing is that every morning when you wake up, ah! Your pocket is mysteriously filled with twenty-four hours of your life's universe that have not yet been manufactured. This is yours, this is the most precious wealth you own! Because, you see! No one can steal it from you. It cannot be stolen. It is assigned fairly by heaven to everyone in the world. Everyone gets the same amount, no more and no less than you, and it is supplied continuously.</p>
<p>But the supply of time, although very regular, is also very harsh. You see! Yesterday is gone, and today is also forever gone. There will never be another ordinary yesterday and today. When tomorrow becomes today, it is also when today is forever gone. Do you know? This is the characteristic of time!</p>
<p>Isn't that very sad, depressing, and frustrating? Indeed, if you do not use your twenty-four hours of income in a planned way, then undoubtedly your life will inevitably be buried in confusion. But you should believe that heaven has given us twenty-four hours, which is more than enough. In these continuous twenty-four hours, what can't we do? We can increase our knowledge; encourage our character; lay the foundation for our lives; we can clear away the current obstacles and difficulties: we can create an environment; build a grand future! We don't need more time. The biggest key is whether we can carefully examine the consumption of our daily time.</p>

<p>The most pitiful people in the world are those blind people who cannot see with their eyes. They are always living in dark and tragic circumstances, lonely and calm. The kind of depression they feel in their hearts is really so distressing!</p>
<p>In order to enable them to appreciate the wonderful texts and works in various newspapers and magazines, the United States has an "audio" magazine. All the required funds are raised by twenty-seven local libraries across the United States that are dedicated to the welfare of the blind.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the magazine, articles from each issue of "Reader's Digest" will be recorded on phonograph records, and then placed in libraries for the general blind to listen to.</p>
<p>This "audio" magazine is scheduled to be published once a month. It is estimated that the number of films required each year will be one hundred to one hundred and twenty. Each side can "speak" for twenty minutes.</p>

<p>—British New Film First Transported to the Western Front</p>
<p>Britain is now transporting the latest films to the Western Front to entertain the troops, while people in London are eagerly awaiting the return of these films from the Western Front to their own country so that they can feast their eyes. Three mobile film teams have traveled from England to France, where the films will be shown on the front lines for the soldiers to pass the time. Because today's armies are mobilized by vehicles, the projectors and films are carried around by vehicles for screenings. Major British film companies are doing their best to cooperate with the authorities to provide the most exciting films for the British Expeditionary Force stationed in France to pass the time.</p>
<p>Some of the latest films have not yet been shown in London's major cinemas, but have already been transported to France to be shown to the troops. Various films have already been collected and transported across the English Channel to France, and many more films will be transported in succession. Perhaps one day, the main film critics in London will fly to a military base in northwestern France to attend the first public screening of a new film in Europe; or perhaps they will sit among British soldiers 100 feet below the ground on the Maginot Line guarded by the British army to watch the new film "Gone with the Wind."</p>
<p>In addition to films, there are also traveling stage plays performed to entertain the soldiers. This type of stage play was very popular with soldiers during the last war. Groups of volunteer actors have been rehearsing plays and various entertainment programs in London, and some have gone to France to perform for the soldiers. Jack White, who went to France to perform plays to entertain soldiers more than twenty years ago, is planning to lead a theater troupe to the French front again.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Thus Have I Heard—Chen Manli's Things of the Past After Her Death <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<p>Let me tell you a joke, "Once upon a time, there was a man who did all kinds of evil in his life and practiced all kinds of good deeds. After he died, he came to the underworld. The King of Hell opened the merit and demerit book and saw that the merit book was densely written, but the demerit book was completely blank. There had never been such a precedent in the underworld. The King of Hell had to ask him to say where he wanted to be reborn. The man was not flustered and slowly recited a poem. When the King of Hell heard it, he quickly stepped down from his seat and bowed to him, saying, 'If there is such a good place, please come and be the next King of Hell, so that I can also go and enjoy myself.' What did the poem say? It is written below—</p>
<p>Surrounded by thousands of acres of fields around the house, there are pavilions, terraces, flowers and fruit gardens, the warehouse is full of gold and silver, the granary is full of millet, there are carriages and horses on land and boats on water, there are娇妻美妾 in every room, and every child and grandchild is贤能, officials do not care and the people are not disturbed, and the life is longer than彭祖 for a thousand years.</p>
<p>When I finished telling this joke, several friends at the table said in unison, "We feel that it's not as fun as marrying Chen Manli." This was said the day before Manli was murdered. As the ancients said, "I would rather not be granted the title of 万户候, but I wish to be one　Han Jingzhou." Chen Manli's magic power is, after all, greater than Han Jingzhou."</p>
<p>"A person must always be content and abide by the law. Chen Manli can be considered a king in our dance girl world. If she could have been content with her profession, she wouldn't have encountered this kind of unexpected disaster. It's really self-inflicted and she deserves it." This is the first thing I heard after Manli died. The person who said it was undoubtedly also a red star.</p>
<p>Once, I met a friend who often danced with Manli. He told me that he was also at the scene the day Manli was murdered. He could still talk while touching his wound. It can be considered a very tragic death. I asked him what his thoughts were? He said, "When someone dies, just replace them with someone else to dance. Anyway, there will never be an end to dance girls." This is an optimist.</p>
<p>A guest said, "Chen Manli's skin is white and crystal clear, and you can't find any blemishes on her body. Now it's really difficult to find someone like that again." This tone is very much like someone who is close to her, otherwise, how could he have examined her so carefully?" Another guest said, "Beautiful, smart, generous, responsive, and willing to learn ball skills, it's not easy for God to create another person like Chen Manli who is talented, versatile, beautiful, generous, and natural. However, it can be said that her age at death is quite appropriate, otherwise, like Sai Jinhua, leaving people with only an image of an old woman in their minds would be so boring." This is also a part of the reason.</p>
<p>I've been talking about other people's opinions, now it's my turn to say mine. Originally, form is emptiness, and emptiness is form. The Buddhist explanation of the word form is touch, seal, destruction. It can be seen that things that can be touched and sealed will eventually change and be destroyed. When it comes to this point, there is no way to continue, so I have to put my palms together and murmur, good, good.</p>

<p>The Yongan Yue Society, organized by colleagues from Yongan Company, will hold Cantonese opera charity performances at the Lanxin Grand Theater from the 22nd to the 27th to help the disaster victims in Zhongshan, Guangdong. The company held a rehearsal of "The Peach Blossom Fan" at Yongan Company the day before yesterday. The reporter interviewed the playwright, Mr. Mai Youyun, who expressed a few thoughts: (1) The writing of Cantonese opera is completely different from Peking opera, but is written in the style of a spoken drama. It tries its best to avoid Cantonese slang. Both the lyrics and the silence are literary, so that this local drama will not be difficult for people to understand. (2) Whether it is in terms of scenery or props, it is made "realistic" to avoid "abstraction." (3) Cantonese opera costumes originally had no restrictions. Actors made them according to their favorite styles, so they often tended to be complicated. This has been gradually improved. Finally, Mr. Mai told me that this performance includes three plays: "Xi Shi," "Pan Jinlian," and "The Peach Blossom Fan." All the tickets have been sold out, raising 50,000 yuan in donations. During the performances, librettos will also be printed and distributed on the stage. They are very enthusiastic about good deeds, which is really admirable.</p>
<p>Dong Zhaobin, the general manager of the Renewal Stage, has already invited the male lead performer Yi Fuying in Beiping. Now Fuying is performing at the Guangming Theater in Dalian starting from the 16th. After five days, he will return to Beiping and then set off for Shanghai.</p>
<p>Wang Xichun has returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the German bao steamer. Yesterday, a telegram was sent to her home in Shanghai reporting that she would be able to land at the New Customs Wharf at 2:00 pm today, asking her family to pick her up.</p>

<p>Chinese cartoonists Wan Laiming and Wan Guchan's plan to produce a full-length cartoon has been adopted by Xinhua Company, and everything has been negotiated. Xinhua has built a large studio that can accommodate 300 people in Dingxiang Garden. It is estimated that the work of 300 people can produce one book per month (a full-length film requires nine or ten books). The cost of a full-length film will be at least 100,000 yuan. The announced "Princess Iron Fan," which is based on the story of "Journey to the West," will be available to the audience as early as next spring.</p>
<p>There are some discrepancies in the rumor that Guohua and Zhou Jianyun are working together. Now, what the two parties are negotiating is the method of renting Guohua's new studio to Zhou's Ghost Tricks, rather than jointly renting the two companies. In the future, administrative economics, etc., will all be independent of each other and will not interfere with each other.</p>

<p>Rook 9 advances 1 Rook 2 advances 6 Rook 9 to 4 Pawn 9 advances 1 Rook 4 advances 7</p>
<p>Horse 8 advances 9 Pawn 1 advances 1 Pawn 1 advances 1 Rook 1 advances 4 Cannon 8 advances 7</p>

<p>Explanation</p>
<p>According to this encirclement, the black side has lost a lot of initiative, and it is difficult to seek a draw. If the red cannon 7 to 1 changes to red rook 1 to 4, then the black horse 9 advances 8 changes to red rook 4 advances 4. The black rook 8 advances 1 exchanges rooks, then the black side can gain the initiative. Change the horse 9 advances 8, the rook 4 to 2. The black side cannot exchange four horses for rooks. If they exchange, they will lose a piece. The black side must cannon 8 to 9, pawn 7 advances 1, cannon 9 retreats 7 to exchange cannons to maintain the balance.</p>
