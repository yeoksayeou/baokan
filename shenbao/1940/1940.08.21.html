<p>社評</p>
<h3>英德戰略的檢討</h3>
<p>英德兩國空軍近日的交戰，其親模之浩大，其情况之劇烈，眞是古今中外莫與倫比。戰訉傳來，飛機吼聲的悽厲似可得而遙聞，炸彈爆發的烟霧似可得而遙見；雙方所損耗，所破壞，以及所犧牲的一切，雖雙方公告盡是輕描淡寫，但可得而想見其奇鉅至於難於估計。雖然，縱觀大勢，現在還祗是初期的階段；今後的緊張嚴重，行見其將十百倍於現在。即就現在而論，我們的視聽亦切莫爲震耳的悽厲與漫天的烟霧所蒙蔽；要知道空軍交戰決非英德近日正在鬥爭中的全貌。試就多方面加以檢討：</p>
<p>先說英國方面。英國爲了爭取對德戰爭的最後勝利，他在軍事以外的工作，約可分爲三項：（一）封鎖德義，澈底斷絕兩國的海外接濟，（二）在自己遍佈世界的廣大屬地裏，從事於動員及組織一切力量，（三）用盡一切方法，阻止德義擴充海軍及修復與利用已經被征服的各國所有資源。就第一點說，像第一次歐戰一樣，針對着對方最大弱點，使對方有限的資源，在現代戰爭的大量耗費裏，自趨於枯竭，陷於欲戰不能的境地而承認戰敗。可是，這一次英國所遭遇的，與上决有四大不同之處：其一，是所謂「中立」國的衆多；其二，是東隣俄國的對德善意中立；其三，義大利站在德國的一面；其四，法國等相繼半途屈服。這在英國方面當然增加了封鎖上許多的困難。同時却有一點可以補償的；就是歐洲許多所謂「中立」國的消失，反而使英國無所顧慮的厲行封鎖，祗要英國海上覇權一天不動搖，便得在大西洋，北海，地中海等水上，三面封鎖德義。所成問題的，如何可以勸使蘇聯站開去，恪守名符其實的「中立」。</p>
<p>就第二點說，所謂英帝國也者，以面積論，他的本部連愛爾蘭在內，祗有十一萬多方哩，而其屬地却達一千三百萬方哩左右；以人口論，本部是四千五百萬人左右，而屬地却達四萬五千萬人左右之多。至於物質資源，英國本部的食糧，幾乎全部倚賴海外供給；其他原料則除煤鐵外，也幾乎全靠海外輸入。故英國對德戰爭的能吾制勝，一半是決之於封鎖對方，另一半則決之於對於自己屬地力量，能否充分的加以動員組織與運用。總合上述兩點，即封鎖對方與運用自己，要在始終不讓對方在海擴充力量，或修復利用被征服各國的資源，以與自己爭覇，亦即所以維持自己的海上覇權。這一點，就是前舉的英國當前的第三點工作。</p>
<p>再說德國方面。無論德國打了多少勝仗，牠的對英致勝的唯一捷徑，仍然是在於速戰速決。可是目前是否可能，殆爲識者的共同疑問。迨戰爭一入膠着狀態而成長期之局，則德國要想粉碎英帝國的另一途徑，就祗有同時擴充海上與空中的力量，併力以對付英國的海上力量，然後一決雌雄。到現在爲止，誰都無法體認德國統帥部，是否已經放棄了速戰速決的企圖，而專心一意從事於準備長期戰爭呢，還是仍然抱着速決的希望。現在表面可以看到的，德國取着雙管齊下的策略，即一面採取大規模的轟炸，同時加緊對英倫三島的「封鎖」。若由此而順利演進，若德國對英爭得了完全制空權及破壞英國海上交通的大部，則德國可以期望使英國的人心，慢慢浮動起來，逐漸達到逼迫英國屈服的實現。這是異常艱鉅的工程，與對法比荷波等國的「閃電戰」大不相同了。然而這一工程成功的可能性，似乎也不很大。假如不能實現，德國祗有採取長期作戰的一條路，祗有盡力擴張海上力量，以及輔助海上力量的空中力量；同時，更用盡一切方法，對抗英國的日漸加緊的封鎖。</p>
<p>兩方面根本戰略，大致若此。而這幾天來兩方面劇烈空戰的意義，這在德國方面，要在竭力爭取英國天空的制空權，企圖動搖英國抗戰的決心；這在英國方面，要在破壞德國修復或利用被征服國家資源的企圖。</p>

<h3>金融　外滙市象殊恍惚</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、滙豐掛脾、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、雖起伏不大、而走勢略感不定、自晨以至晚收、美滙交易暢旺、先令甚少過問、故結果呈英鬆美緊狀態、晨開後因投機家華行等均傾向賣出、頭寸充裕、平中帶硬、後以美行吃胃尙健、午收回軟、後市人心又受影響、謂本市英軍撤退乙區、本由美軍接防、或將改萬國商團駐守、於是賣戶不前、多數看緊、晚收價美滙遂仍吿五元五三一二五、英金則爲三辦士七〇三一二五、比上日英反鬆〇一五六二五、美則軟〇三一二五、期貨走勢與現貨同途、</p>
<p>華商等繼續塞出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠均跌〇六二五、美銀價不動、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美不動、對滬亦平、美對英大一分半、對滬小九分、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨買價、英金三辦士六八七五、美匯五元五三一二五、較之上日收市、英平美則緊〇三一二五、開後美行稍有吃胃、惟華商投機家來市售出、計售予美行九月份美匯五元半，後除華商投機家繼續肚塞外、華銀行亦賣、市面微硬、八月份美滙外行吸入由五元五三一二五、以至五九三七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉、悉無更動、白銀平衡稅揭曉　百分之〇·二五、此後市面靜中呈盤旋狀態、計日行進外行八月份美滙五元五六二五、而不久塞予外行九月份美滙五元五三一二五、十一時後華商投機家仍售、時有利吸入九月份美滙僅爲五元五六二五、又美行與外行對做同月美滙亦吿五元五六二五、但收盤市賣戶稍怠、價轉軟、結果英金三辦士七〇三一二五、美滙五元五三一二五、比晨開英長〇一五六二五、美無榮辱、</p>
<p>後市人心又轉變</p>
<p>午後初况尙平、計有利塞予外行八月份美滙仍五元五六二五、而終以人心不定、乃鑒於本市英軍撤退乙區、將改由萬國商團接防之說、市面至收盤時略又回緊、結果英金三辦士七〇三一二五、美滙五元五三一二五、九月份英金三辦士六七一八七五、美滙五元半、較上收美金期現各長〇一五六二五、美滙則緊〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>金市捉摸不定</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤唁盤市况、午盤平疲、後市堅好、人心難以捉摸、經營者步伐不齊、而價格之穩定、繫於匯市之盤旋中、晨開爲五千七百三十五元、某錢兌業出而卽降、惟該號重來復進、金號亦拉回升至五千七百四十五元、嗣以銀號多頭所售、錢兌業金號俱出、再壓低至五千七百元、終聞外匯微緊、散戶吃入、收盤尙吿五千七百四十元、後市爲狀較佳、開後證券幫銀號等咸撈、由五千七百四十五元、抬至五千七百六十五元、雖未幾另一銀號求售、而晚收時頗昂、證券幫猛購吿五千七百五十二元、收盤較上日軋升二十二元、全日交易尙旺、約二千餘兩、銀樓飾金終則未動、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲念餘元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開平平、首由錢兌業出小錢莊五十兩爲五千七百三十五元、比前收略抬五元、嗣錢兌業及銀號力賣、不久步挫二十元、銀號對做三十兩、爲五千七百十五元、旋因某錢兌業突來補空、且某銀號斯時吃胃亦濃、而金號亦有扒進、遂被抬起三十元、金號進銀號十兩、升爲五千七百四十五元、此後證券幫乘高吐賣、某銀號隔夜多頭出籠、加之金號亦反進爲出、未幾再跌四十五元、銀號出銀樓業及同業等五十兩、爲五千七百元低價、此後另一銀號忽見賤拖入、價乃復又向上、且加空戶紛紛抵補、迨午收竟昂至五千七白四十元、收後市勢仍堅、五千七百四十五元尙有買戶、午後首由金號互做十兩、爲五千七百四十五元、嗣經某銀號及證券幫撈入、曾高達五千七百六十五元、後以另一銀號拋空、及金號幫不斷吐出、回小二十五元、銀號對做二十兩、爲五千七百四十元、入後卒因證券幫復來加碼吸收、重又拉起十二元、證券幫進銀號十兩、爲五千七百五十二元作晚收價、結果比上日軋漲二十二元、全天六十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金終日未動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日未動、大同行依然懸五百九十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>美票一漲卽跌</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤盤旋略漲、英美金鎊因亦略漲五角、英金票供求均勻、市價站平、美金票一度高至十八元一角、卒又退爲十七元九角三分、比上日尙漲一分、香港票需要不弱、市價昂漲、日金票及朝鮮票仍不乏需要、市價一致續漲、前者續高全一元三角九分半、後者續高至一元零六分、</p>
<h3>貼現回上二元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率忽見回上、每千元上午貼進二十四元、貼出須三十六元、下午又升至三十七元、貼進亦須三十五元、比上日升二元、錢業公會拆息早午兩市均掛一角五分、計升起一分云、</p>
<h3>證券　統乙漲勢最勁　外股午後亦昂</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、初仍軟弱無神、繼又堅挺、尤以午後形勢爲最佳、乙種已穿出四元關、與速利息行市相埒、丙種逼近一元、丁種五十元大關、行將衝出、一般金融界買進漸見興奮、債市回蘇已有冬去春來之象、所謂欣欣向榮、不久將來當可實現、昨日交易、午前無甚精彩、午後買氣驟濃、其中以四十一號及三十八號兩家收買最湧、且此兩家多日來已收進不少、而猶餘勇可賈、殊未可輕視、因此多方加碼、空方抵補、一時紛起、如怡泰聯和之抵　、　　長泰之加碼、市况仍緊信遇　、　有　益多頭不當出籍、同康又轉賣出，胡　記益昌信織矓萬拋賣、市氣仍甚蓬勃、前進尙有好氣象也、市價結果、一致　漲一二角至四角半、其中以乙種抽　權利相近關係、故漲風獨勁、成交總數的有一百三四十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交交通銀行股一百股、價爲六十元零五角、</p>
<p>又眾業公所昨日股市開盤、黯澹如故、後忽漸趨活躍、下午蓬勃之勢、爲輓近多星期中所僅見墾殖股首先上漲、會德豐上海企業二股　之、洛信託公司受其反其立風堅昂、上騰頗劇，其　實　反近收盤時、潛勢亦　、　久被忽視之橡皮設、亦被住意、　突兀之漲風、因謠傳美國有早期加入歐戰、協助英國之希望，但此晚在員下觀之、未免猶屬　是應非也、</p>
<p>倫敦　十九日（邏一）電、今日中國外價及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、大致均吿平靜、祇麥加利銀行股續跌三先令九便士、價爲六鎊七先令六便士、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>崇信紗廠派息</h3>
<p>英商庚興洋行經理之崇信紗廠有限公司、截至一九四〇年六月底一年度之盈餘、計國幣四百八十二萬餘元、全年股息、每股計派股息及紅利各七元五角、共計官紅利國幣十五元、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米存底充實　有貨者急於求售</h3>
<p>洋米雖仍無甚上落、但其間變化多端、起伏不定、早開賣買雙方均怵於上日疲勢、買方旣鮮問津、貨方以存底充實、新米轉瞬上市、莫不急於求脫、故開市後高决各檔、一律續小三五角、旋有南幫鄉莊內地等趁小問津、市價始漸抬頭、然進戶以心思居多、實銷尙無整胃、而本街在平糶首日開辦之際尤少顧問、卒以定局見稱、收盤行情、一號陳西貢仍爲五十八元、二號五十二元半、五十二元、一號退邏、五十八元、五十七元半、二號五十一元半、五十一元、火絞五十七元二角、五十七元、香港尖五十五六元、次五十一元半、五十一元、小絞五十二元半、五十二元、東京砶尖中關四十七元、四十六元半、糙尖四十五六元、碎尖四十二三元、米菉四十四五元、二號原包暹邏進口者始開六十一元半、比上週末較小一元、二號西貢轉棧速費六十三元二角、又轉口六十二元半、亦較小五八角、總計成交不足三百噸、現米則有五千餘包云、</p>
<p>太古公司江蘇輪、自暹邏裝來洋米九千六百八十一包、昨晨到埠、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、又該公司太原輪亦於昨午到滬、自香港運來八百七十三包、停靠法租界本行碼頭起卸、華綸洋行海達輪、前日自暹邏裝來一萬六千餘包、咋已起卸完竣、該輪定日出口、繼續赴西貢運米來滬、</p>
<p>糯米雖來源缺乏、奈銷塲亦微、除飯担零星去路外、鮮有躉數交易、故貨主欲求扳俏、僅堪堅守原盤、開溧陽特元六十一元、金溧特元六十元零七角、常丹貨五十八九元、五十七元、與前相仿而已、至於洋糯平素售價、本較國糯爲貴、後以到貨不絕、且用途不若本　之普遍、致一再貶抑、直落於國糯之下、客販因是受虧非淺、瞻念前途、不再續訂、市貨亦已减薄、茲開價特貨與本糯平肩、不過普通貨、依然較遜一籌、所以昨開特別香港糯六十一元、六十元、普通五十七八元、次五十五元、砶元五十二三元，</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、傳聞塲外暗盤、堪稱供求相仿之局售價與前相埒、無所榮辱、</p>
<p>周浦新粳來源轉稀、昨祇到三十五担、所以成交難屬有限、而市色獨呈堅緊、開特貨六十二元、大市六十一元、次碎潮柔者僅六十元左右、</p>
<h3>日廠粉　開出大批期貨</h3>
<p>現粉市况、已轉平疲之局、查二號粉廠盤、仍爲十五元、銷路仍以本街爲主、福新及阜豐兩廠、均有零星供給、兩廠批出數量、的計四千餘包、客銷方面、因華廠粉運輸不便、對於日粉需要則尙佳、綠鳳凰牌十月份期貨開出四千包、價十四元九角二三分、本月份十四元八角、現粉亦開五百包、價十四元六角、因回籠貨售脫者尙衆、故市面殊形平軟、內地粉及洋粉進出兩淡、均鮮變化、</p>
<p>小麥市况、續吿穩定、近日虹口與閘北來源、略見增多、各棧存底、亦屬不少、貨方以產價高昂、不願輕脫、日廠方面吃盤不出二十一元、故雖有解廠貨三千餘包、尙在評價談論中、華廠收貨仍祇零星小票、售價不一、市面正在漲跌兩難之間、</p>
<h3>雜糧　九江新豆上市　價開三十一元</h3>
<p>九江來各種雜糧、大都由安慶轉來、故今庚九江城門新豆仍由安慶轉滬、市塲中交易仍冠以安慶新豆、昨首批運抵八十包、貨品差可人意、由木街零售業分去、價爲三十一元、陳豆來源見接、人心懈淡、交易减色、市價高定次軟、成交大速豆三百包、價爲三十五元至三十五元二角、靑島豆二百包、價爲三十四元、崇明豆一百五十包、價爲三十元零一角、又沙黃一百包、價爲二十九元五角、浦東杜豆五百包、價爲三十三元至三十三元七角、去路除靑島豆由南洋幫辦去外、餘均爲本街之胃云、</p>
<p>豆子今日有一千二百九十包、運往香港、又昨日由烟台來生仁一千二百包、</p>
<h3>紗花　生產過賸　紗市重降</h3>
<p>上日趨升之紗市、昨則復轉下風、此因實際交易淸淡、人心平凡、故多方雖則看好拉進、然環境所不許、根本問題、還係生產增而消費减、所以基礎仍不能鞏固、目前情形、尙在盤旋醞釀中、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、市勢尚熱烈、承上日之好面續進、多頭拉提甚强、二十支雙馬開價爲九百二十五元、漲至九百三十元此盤一開、檀面上買者未旺同時現銷平庸、氣勢又轉下檔、一般搶帽子之輩、見風使舵、紛粉吐出、於此籌碼一鬆、市價步步下降至九百零九元、收盤稍上、查半日間成交統計一千零九十五包、行情一十支雙爲跌十元外、今日有紗一百四十件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、六〇〇　香港　四八五</p>
<p>厦門　一〇　統計　二、〇九五</p>
<h3>棉市暗澹</h3>
<p>現棉情形、依然暗淡如恒、廠家採辦殊滯、所以市面無大進出也、印棉價爲二百十九元、同行成交三百件、棧交火機價爲一百六十元、同行成交一百八十包、棧交、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷赤堅挺</h3>
<p>荷糖兩日間、俱見上展、而荷赤因貨缺銷旺、漲勢較勁、惟太古車白以前定賤價之貨、行將到申、故市價反鬆、昨公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白、本棧七十三元、外棧七十二元六角至八角、老貨七十二元二角、轉口貨五十七元半、比前（十八日）均升元許、荷棉白平定、TML嘜七十　KD嘜七！　　　　　以存　步緊、初爲六十元七角至六十一元、後由六十一元八角至六十二元、升二元許、太古車白B嘜七十四元八角、DY嘜七十元、HX嘜六十九元半、小二角至五角、H嘜軍赤六十元、升元半、本廠籌白七十一元半、本冰無上落、國糖東鄉赤白包好貨開五十四元、油包五十二元五角、俱升元半、共成交五百包之譜、香港幫開冰花靑二百包、仍七十三元、查糖昨日香港來七十包、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球廠盤减低　每担六元八角</h3>
<p>煤球行情、日來因外滙回鬆、同業廠盤自當酌量减低、日昨經公會集議決定、義泰與南洋國華煤球、同業自車棧單、每噸一百二十四元、送到另加車力、本街門莊、每担六元八角、較前週每噸减低六元盤子、</p>
<h3>海味　烟台海蜒售開</h3>
<p>烟台海蜓、來源久寂、最近始有運到、卽經起棧、視其貨身頗乾、昨已售開、成盤爲二百零五元、</p>
<p>十九日芝加哥電·麥市因西北拋售·廠家與業外興趣渺小·加以浮多紛紛吐售·故稍疲跌·</p>

<h3>讀「某伴舞者」來信後</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>有署名「某某舞榭伴舞者」寄來一封信，文字很幼稚，費解之處更多，但是她（姑且認她爲舞女）主要的意思，還能從這短短的信中看出來。</p>
<p>她的意思是：最近各舞塲的舞客，可分爲兩大類：一種是「投機得意之後，有錢沒處用的人」；一種是「西裝畢挺，而跳舞之後逃之夭夭的人」。她來信的「希望」是：她們被生活所迫而做舞女，自然希望有錢人來救濟，但是一擲千金，毫無吝色，她們似乎也覺得受之有愧（還有其他的居心自然更不敢想），所以希望這些「有錢沒處用的人」分出一半來做其他的慈善事業。對於那些「跳白舞」的「靑年子弟」，也希望他們努力於學業，不要把光陰浪費在舞塲里。</p>
<p>這對信是不是眞的出諸一個舞女的手筆，無從探知，但從文字上推測，寫這封信的人至少是與舞塲有關，或者說是賴舞塲爲生者（如舞女，僕歐等），而月是位有心人。在信的最末有「我是未曾受過相當敎育的人」，她的苦痛，更溢於言表。</p>
<p>要證明「孤島」的畸形發展，聲色之塲自然是最好的一面照妖鏡。他們的不顧大衆的生活，在市塲里拼命造謠生事，掀風作浪，就是想裝滿自己的腰包，謀一己之享樂，「慈善事業」云云，誠如上海的土語「談也　談」。可是悖入者悖出，他們的一擲千金，也至少救濟了少數人（舞女）的厄難，當然，他們如果還存有其他的壞念頭，這是舞界姊妹應該自己當心的。</p>
<p>至於那些西裝畢挺的「跳白舞」者，除了來信中所說「委實太可惡了」之外，我更覺得「委實太可惜了」！</p>
<p>最後，據昨報的消息：七月份全市冬舞塲的舞客統計，較六月份减少三萬人，這是最有力的警吿：它側面說明了投機的不足恃；跳白舞」的或許竟是如「喪家之犬」了。</p>

<h3>「櫃台猢猻」</h3>
<p>— 陳國宰</p>
<p>「櫃台猢猻」是我的外號。我做「櫃台糊猻」到現在，也已四五個年頭了。這四五個年頭中，我的成績只是學會吃水烟，打瞌統。其餘什麼也沒有，有，落得了一個「櫃台猢猻」的榮譽。每天，早晨八點鐘到晚上九點鐘，除了吃飯時間以外，沒有休息，整整十二小時，是我們的工作時間。一年之中，除了幾個大節以外，沒有星期和假日，一天到晚，一年到頭，始終是站櫃台，睡覺；睡覺，站樅台。我們工作是十分刻板，生活也十分單調，沒有波浪，更沒有變化，每天如此，每年如此。我吃的是南貨飯，初進店，做練習的櫃台猢猻，但是並不是學徒，只是沒有做正式櫃台猢猻的資格就是。那時學學包三角包，打打秤，看看鈔票，幫助招呼客人，其餘就是站在店堂間中，向馬路上閒望，評評在店堂前走過的女人，那個好，那個不好。其實這關我們什麼事。有時，也管管閒事，做做和事老。光陰飛快地逝去，我也由練習而變爲正式了。那時，我非但學會了打秤，包包紮，看鈔票，招呼容人，並且還學會了取巧的方法，欺騙顧客的手段。譬如說，明明是十四兩的東西，但是我們有方法可以使秤上表示出　斤二兩的。同時，我對於品評女人，管閒事的手段也更高明了。沒有事，一面抽水烟，一面就專們品評人家。我們的工作，十分簡單，送往迎來，招呼客人，其餘沒有了。但是縱然生意是如何的淸，可是我們却不能離開櫃台一步。這樣難怪人家要稱我們「櫃台猢猻」了。因爲工作淸閒，所以就形成了我們一種袖手旁觀，辦事遲緩的習慣。過去，我們的老前輩還往往獎勵我們學習這種不死不活的態度，更美其名曰「涵養」，學會了這種功夫，可以延年益壽。的確，從我經騐中得來，這種不死不活的態度直接不能延年益壽，間接却可以延年益壽。你不信只要看每一個站櫃台的，他們很少有火氣的，你對他着急，光火，他對你笑笑，至多慢呑吞的回你一聲來啦！」這樣爐火純靑的態度，怎不延年益壽呢？講到我們的待遇，那麼實在是很菲薄的。我們一年的收入，還比不上銀行裏練習生一個月的俸給。我們「先生們的待遇原來是四塊大洋，學徒們是二千銅元。那麼你們也許得問，我們是怎樣在生活的，又怎樣養家活口的。先生，請你不必着急，聽我慢慢的說來。鋪中供給我們食宿，四塊錢就是我們實收的零用，當然要拿這四塊錢來養活一個家庭是不可能的。但是，每一個櫃台猢猻他們都有家的，他們的家眷也始終沒有餓死，這又是靠什麽方法呢？道裏我可以吿訴你：在老式店舖中，站櫃台的職員所靠的不是少數的月俸，而是年終的紅利。年底我們可以拿到幾十倍乃至幾百倍於我們月俸的紅利。所以平時，我們的收入，只能維持我們個人，而每年年底的分紅，却是維持我們家庭的惟一源泉。因此「櫃台猢猻」的收入雖然少，可是還能苦度歲月，在一般舊式商店的職員中，「猢猻」還是好職位呢。</p>

<h3>舞后的婦宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>電話間面前有幾個人在那裏談話，現在想來，的確有些兒異樣。但地上並沒有受傷的人。誰打他的呢？倪金壽旣然知道了這個消息，怎麼反來問我？太矛盾了！這案子突然間有這樣的劇變，不但出我的意外，委實使我失却了應付的能力。</p>
<p>「哎喲！霍先生會有危險嗎？包先生，你得想想法子。」</p>
<p>我承認這時候我委實沒有法子，又答不出話，祇向施桂搖了搖手。我記得盡桑常說的一句話：「慌亂解決不了問題，反而會增加危難的程度，而使你一誤冉誤。」我自己忖度着「對，我得鎭靜下來，找一條解救的出路。」我抽了一支紙烟，坐在沙發上，慢慢地擦着火柴，將紙烟燒着了。可是施桂仍在我面前發怔。</p>
<p>我又安慰他說：「施桂，你不用這樣。我相信憑着霍先生的機智，卽使有什麽意外，決不致有嚴重的危險。你到外面去，倪探長也許立刻會到。他來了，我們自然有進行的辦法。」</p>
<p>我並不是空言安慰施桂，我的確有眞切的信心。霍桑所遭遇的大敵，像毛獅子，江南燕一類的人物，一時間也算不淸楚；彈丸的滋味，不但他嘗得不少，速我身上也找得出好幾個疤痕。所以我相信他一定不會有性命的危險。</p>
<p>倪金壽搁好電話以後，直到趕到愛文路來，相隔不過六七分鐘。這六七分鐘之間，我的腦細胞的消耗量，其數一定可驚。不過我的結論，到底是樂觀的。在我遣出施桂以後，我的紙烟還沒有燒完，嗚嗚的汽車聲已在門口停住了。我忙丟了烟尾立起來。倪金壽便匆匆地走進來，施桂反跟在他後面。我瞧見倪金壽的神氣十一分緊張，眼睛向辦公室中亂轉，好像還在希望霍桑已經回來。</p>
<p>他問道：「還沒有消息嗎？」</p>
<p>我搖搖頭。「還沒有。你坐下來，別慌，到底怎麼一回事？我還不淸楚。」　（八二）</p>

<p>好萊塢各大影片公司，最近都爭相趕建地下攝影塲，把拍片工作，全部遷至地下室去進行了。其原因，是因爲美國的各飛機工廠，在最近世界風雲聲中，正日夜不停地趕造大批飛機。而每一飛機製成之後，必在附近作一度低空試飛，以查騐機件方面各部是否完全無疵。美國的飛機工廠，在洛杉磯城的很多。那里離好萊塢極近。又據最近美國富局的調查，每一飛機製造廠，平均每四十分鐘卽可出貨一架。而每製成一架飛機，又必在附近上空作一度試騐低飛。因之近日好萊塢的上空，終日隆隆之聲不絕，震耳欲聾。而這些巨大的機聲，對於影片公司拍片的收音工作上有引起雜音的影響，而這種雜音，又是有聲影片的致命傷。各影片公司在這種現象初發生的時候，曾使用過種種技術上的防止方法，但終於無效。他們又在影片公司附近的上空昇放橙黃色汽球，以警吿那些飛機切勿飛近該處，以免破壞各影片公司的拍片工作。當時好萊塢郊外各影片公司莫不採用這種警告式的方法。以致「攝塲塲區」天空盡是纍纍的橙色汽球，煞是好看。這種信號，在一般專門的航空人員，自然一望而知，不再飛近那一帶了。但是一些業餘的航空家門，却還未能明白道些橙色汽球的意義。他們在天空看見了，反而以爲寄觀。甚至本來在遠處的，也都爭相飛近來觀看了。這一來，却反而招來了更多的鬧聲。因之各影片公司爲了一勞永逸地避免這些飛機的雜聲起見，便相繼建造設備極完善的地下攝影塲。這些地下攝影塲，除了具備普通攝影塲的一切設備之外，並有十分有效的隔音及防空設備。以備萬一，一旦國內有事的時候，仍可照常在地下從事撿片工作，而不致如第一次大戰時那樣束手無策而陷於停頓的狀態。</p>
<h3>國產電影新創作</h3>
<p>— 稜白</p>
<p>採取雙重收音法</p>
<p>如果說電影能够控制觀者情感的話，那麼，在我相信，其中音響的背襯最足推進效果的。歐美影片的受人激賞，非但背景偉大和演技精湛，卽在音響方面，也能配有美麗的音樂。往往使人聽了，感到非常的舒服，所以有人說道：音樂能够安慰精神。這是並不過火的。外來片仗着科學物質的進步，且在對話中，也能配置音樂。這種雙重收音法，叫做Dubbin。但Dubbin在國片中，却因機械落後的關係，除了分別收音外，從來未曾採取過。</p>
<p>最近。記者從國聯影業公司那裏，探到一個消息，就是在以後「西施」「蘇武牧羊」諸片中，也能採取雙重收音法了。在銀幕上，可以同時聽到對白與音樂，這個就是上面所說的Dubbin。</p>
<p>據他們說：這種Dubbin，先是收取對白，然後再在收音室中開放，以便同時收音樂；如此，就能在銀幕上，一同傳達到觀衆的耳膜中，可與歐美各片媲美。當然，這種機械的代價相當高貴，而且在收取時尺寸都要配準量好，吾則就要過與不及了。</p>
<h3>「春江風月」觀感</h3>
<p>— 陶</p>
<p>本來世界上僅多不如意的人！有天才的作曲家，他美麗不朽的歌曲只賣了十五元錢。雖然有一時他是成功了，他是富有了，但是不久因爲他命運的不濟，他又爲大衆所遺棄，終於潦倒一生，終日酗酒，結果憂愁而死。這就是美國音樂家史蒂芬福斯德的人生，亦就是「春江風月」劇情的大概！</p>
<p>不過史蒂芬是死了！他美麗的曲子却永遠在世界上每一個人的嘴裏哼着，他畢竟是不朽的！片中揷曲有「蘇珊呀」「琪思之棕髮」等六支。而其中以史帝芬老僕「老裘」臨死時請求而作之「老黑裘」（Old　BLack　Joe），及其最後遺作「在家之舊親友」（The　Old　Folks　at　Home爲最動聽。</p>
<p>本片在藝術上之成績，平平而已。音樂氣氛頗濃厚。若與「翠堤春曉」相比擬，其差尙遠。然導演薛特耐倫菲（Sidney　Lanfidel）之手段亦不弱。他處理本片尙無贅累之塲面，使劇情能平穩發展，而幾個高潮亦很有力，不失爲一成功之作。粽言之，則氣氛最佳之塲面有二：一爲史蒂芬坐聽黑人們工作時唱歌作樂，再配以大自然之景色，令人神往。一爲最後當史蒂芬「在家之舊親友」一曲作成而尙未公唱前，忽因飲酒過多而心臟病復發，窮困不治而死。於是由亞爾喬生對聽衆訴說史蒂芬已與世長逝，並且唱其最後之遺作，再命聽衆起立與之合唱，當時悲哀抑揚的情緒，使人回想史蒂芬以往潦倒的狀况，就是在銀幕下的觀衆，亦不禁爲之淚下了！</p>
<p>全片染以五彩，畫面甚美。演員中唐亞曼契之史蒂芬福斯德演技已達化境，安德麗里絲之琪恩平平而已，亞爾喬生之唱歌頗不爲我國人所歡迎，然其演技則老到異常。總而言之，這是不失爲一張可以一看的片子。</p>

<h3>The East African War Takes a Sharp Turn: British Forces Withdraw from Somaliland; Retreat of the Entire Force Under Naval and Air Cover; Official Statement Claims Failure Primarily Due to France Abandoning Alliance</h3>
<p>London: Due to France's surrender, British forces in East Africa found themselves outnumbered compared to the attacking Italian forces. They have now withdrawn from British Somaliland. According to a War Office statement, all the British artillery in the area, except for two pieces lost early in the fighting, had been shipped out. Most of the stored materials and equipment were also evacuated. The British army withdrew methodically with the assistance of naval and air forces. The original defense plan for Somaliland was based on close cooperation between Britain and France, with the French forces in Djibouti guarding the right flank, which was the linchpin of the entire defensive line. The sudden cessation of hostilities by the French government created a serious new situation. With more than half of the Allied forces remaining neutral, the British had to immediately decide on the most effective way to deal with the emergency. Although various options were available, such as reinforcing British forces in Somaliland to ensure its safety, this would have required the use of significant reserves, which would have weakened the reserves needed in other theaters of the war that were more important to Britain than Somaliland. The time factor was also a major consideration, so this plan had to be abandoned. Another option was to withdraw immediately without resistance. However, abandoning territory without a fight would have meant losing the opportunity to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy, making it difficult for them to replenish their manpower and resources. The third option was to leave a small detachment of British forces in the area to inflict maximum damage on the enemy before withdrawing when it became unavoidable. The British ultimately chose the third option. Now, the British forces have completely withdrawn from Somaliland, and the artillery and most of the materials and equipment have been shipped out. Everything else has been destroyed. The wounded British soldiers have also been safely evacuated. The British army worked closely with the Royal Navy and Air Force, fighting against a strong enemy while methodically withdrawing. The enemy suffered heavy casualties, especially the Blackshirt units, while the British losses were very light compared to the enemy. (Reuter, 20th)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, the British Empire completely abandoned the key territory of British Somaliland. This is the first time Britain has lost territory in a war since the American Revolution 164 years ago. As a result, Italy has gained access to the Gulf of Aden and can partially control the southern entrance to the Red Sea, posing a serious threat to the port of Aden and ocean shipping routes. (International News Service, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome: The British Somaliland, from which British forces have withdrawn, has a total area of 68,000 square miles, only slightly smaller than the mainland of Britain. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Cairo: According to an official announcement, the British military commander of the Gulf of Aden has destroyed the undeveloped port of Berbera and other docking areas along the Somaliland coast to prevent them from being used by the Italian military. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that after destroying the resistance of the enemy rearguard yesterday afternoon, our forces have now occupied the main city of British Somaliland, Berbera. Before fleeing onto warships, the British army set fire to the city. A company of British camel soldiers stationed in Hargeisa has surrendered to our forces and turned over all their military equipment. Our forces launched a surprise attack on the enemy positions in Qarababad, and the enemy retreated without being able to withstand the attack, capturing a large amount of war booty. Enemy aircraft bombed Negrelli-Bardia-Merca-Kinnaroo and other places, causing little damage. On the North African front, enemy aircraft bombed a hospital in the area of ​​Derna, killing one patient and injuring twelve. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>
<h3>The Sinking of the "Glorious" Confirmed; More Than a Thousand Officers and Men Killed or Wounded</h3>
<p>London: According to a casualty list released by the Admiralty, the British aircraft carrier "Glorious", which was lost off Norway in June, had a total of 1,204 officers and men killed or wounded.

Forty-three officers are missing, seventy-one soldiers were killed in action, one died of severe wounds, and 869 are missing. In addition, five Royal Air Force personnel were killed in action and thirty-two are missing. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>The Italian-Egyptian War Could Erupt at Any Moment</p>
<p>Milan: Italian newspapers yesterday published a number of photos and news reports about the various measures taken by the Italian army in Libya to prepare for an attack on Egypt. According to a report from a "Popolo d'Italia" war correspondent, the Italian-Egyptian war could erupt at any moment. (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Cairo: A war report regarding the Western Desert battle stated that British patrols reported seeing thick smoke rising as high as a hundred feet after the British navy bombarded the military supplies stored in the Capuzzo region on August 17th. The smoke lingered for hours. On Sunday, a unit of about thirty Italian soldiers encountered a small unit of British African Riflemen a few miles from Buna in Kenya before retreating. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>A Naval Battle Occurs in the Eastern Mediterranean</p>
<p>Budapest: Residents of Crete, a Greek island in the Mediterranean, said that the sound of heavy artillery fire was heard all day yesterday off the coast. Many believe that a British-Italian naval battle is in progress. (International News Service, 20th)</p>
<p>Cairo: A communique released here this morning stated that three enemy aircraft flew to within less than thirty-five miles of Malta yesterday, but retreated after British fighter planes took to the skies. Later, enemy aircraft were reported to be attacking, but they also turned back after British aircraft took to the skies. The British Air Force's covering of the withdrawal from Somaliland was very effective. British bombers also attacked oil depots inside Abyssinia, and all the bombs fell within the target area. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<p>British Air Force Still Maintains Advantage</p>
<p>London: A Reuters Air Force correspondent said that the activities of the British Air Force have greatly increased the difficulty of the Italian army's large-scale offensive preparations in the Near East and Middle East. London claims that the Italian army's invasion of Egypt has been delayed, apparently due to the activities of the British Navy and Air Force. The scope of the British Air Force's offensive is about half again as large as that of the Italian Air Force, and the losses are far fewer than those of Italian aircraft. Although the number of British aircraft is smaller and not the latest models, the aircrews have received excellent training and have very high morale, so they can maintain their advantage. So far, the Italian Air Force has only bombed ships in an attempt to obstruct the British blockade plan and make the Mediterranean an Italian lake. Other than this, the Italian Air Force's strategy is not yet clear. Libya has about 530 Italian aircraft, seemingly waiting for the weather to cool down before taking action. It is believed that Italy has about 1,500 aircraft that can be used in the Middle East. The reason why the Italian Air Force did not help the army attack Somaliland is believed to be because the Italian side is eager to conserve its fuel. In various parts of Abyssinia, especially in the Lake Tana area, there are signs of rebellion, and Italian aircraft must also be prepared to fly there for suppression. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Hitler Congratulates the Italian Prime Minister on the Victory</p>

I hereby send this telegram to congratulate you and hope you will be pleased to accept it." (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome: After the Italian army occupied British Somaliland, German leader Hitler sent a telegram to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to congratulate him. Mussolini sent a reply telegram today stating, "Your Excellency Hitler, I have received your telegram with great respect. I would like to thank you on behalf of the Italian army, Mussolini." (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome: Mussolini sent a special telegram to congratulate Duke Aosta, Governor-General of Abyssinia. The telegram stated, "After our army occupied Berbera, the conquest of British Somaliland can be celebrated. I and all Italian compatriots are paying close attention to every arduous battle.

I hereby send this telegram to congratulate you and wish you every success." (Haitong News Agency, 20th)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Reiterates Determination to Continue the War; Naval Strength Greater Than Before; Intensified Implementation of Blockade Against Germany</h3>
<p>London: The Prime Minister made a statement on the war in the crowded House of Commons today, declaring that Britain is determined not to allow food to pass through its blockade lines, but will try to quickly supply food to any country that is genuinely restoring its freedom. The Prime Minister also reiterated Britain's determination to continue the war in the most solemn terms, saying that we must prepare for the wars of 1941 and 1942. Britain is now stronger than ever before and will cope with everything in the future. The Prime Minister also said that at present, the entire army of the country is at home, and the navy is far stronger than at the start of the war, and is able to effectively control magnetic mines. Brigadier General Strong, Rear Admiral Gomley, and Major General Emmons, military observers sent by the US government to Britain, attended the hearing with the US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Review of British and German Strategies</h3>
<p>The recent battles between the British and German air forces, the scale of which is so vast and the situation so intense, are truly unparalleled throughout history. As the news of the battle spread, the eerie sound of aircraft roars seemed to be heard remotely, and the smoke from the bomb explosions seemed to be seen remotely. The losses, destruction, and sacrifices on both sides, although both sides' announcements are understated, can be imagined to be so huge that it is difficult to estimate. However, looking at the overall situation, this is still only the initial stage; the tension and severity in the future will increase tenfold or a hundredfold compared to now. Even now, our vision and hearing must not be blinded by the deafening wails and the smoke-filled sky; we must know that the air force battle is by no means the full picture of the British-German struggle that is currently underway. Let’s review from various aspects:</p>
<p>First, let’s talk about the British side. In order to strive for the final victory in the war against Germany, its work outside the military can be roughly divided into three items: (1) blocking Germany and Italy, thoroughly cutting off the two countries' overseas supplies; (2) engaging in mobilizing and organizing all forces in its vast territories spread all over the world; (3) using all methods to prevent Germany and Italy from expanding their navies and repairing and utilizing all the resources of the conquered countries. Regarding the first point, like the First World War, targeting the opponent's greatest weakness will cause the opponent's limited resources to dry up in the massive consumption of modern warfare, and fall into a situation where they want to fight but cannot, and admit defeat. However, what Britain has encountered this time is definitely different from the past in four major aspects: first, the large number of so-called "neutral" countries; second, the benevolent neutrality of Russia to the east towards Germany; third, Italy standing on the side of Germany; fourth, France and others successively succumbing halfway. This, of course, has increased many difficulties in the blockade for the British. At the same time, there is one point that can compensate; that is, the disappearance of many so-called "neutral" countries in Europe has instead allowed Britain to implement the blockade without any scruples. As long as Britain's maritime hegemony does not waver for a day, it must block Germany and Italy from three sides on the Atlantic, the North Sea, and the Mediterranean. The problem is how to persuade the Soviet Union to stand aside and abide by the truly meaningful "neutrality."</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, the so-called British Empire, in terms of area, its headquarters, including Ireland, only has more than 110,000 square miles, while its territories reach about 13 million square miles; in terms of population, the headquarters has about 45 million people, while the territories reach as many as about 450 million. As for material resources, the food in the British headquarters almost entirely relies on overseas supply; other raw materials, except for coal and iron, also almost entirely rely on overseas imports. Therefore, whether Britain can win the war against Germany depends half on blocking the opponent, and the other half depends on whether the forces of its own territories can be fully mobilized, organized, and utilized. Combining the above two points, that is, blocking the opponent and utilizing oneself, it is necessary to ensure that the opponent is not allowed to expand its forces at sea or repair and utilize the resources of the conquered countries to compete with itself, that is, to maintain its own maritime hegemony. This point is the third point of Britain's current work mentioned above.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the German side. No matter how many victories Germany wins, its only shortcut to defeating Britain is still a quick victory. But whether this is currently possible is a common question among informed people. Once the war enters a stalemate and grows into a long-term situation, then the only other way for Germany to crush the British Empire is to simultaneously expand its sea and air power, combine its forces to deal with Britain's sea power, and then decide the outcome. Until now, no one can understand whether the German High Command has abandoned the attempt to achieve a quick victory and is wholeheartedly preparing for a long-term war, or is still holding on to the hope of a quick decision. What can be seen on the surface now is that Germany is taking a two-pronged approach, that is, taking large-scale bombing while intensifying the "blockade" of the British Isles. If this progresses smoothly, if Germany wins complete air supremacy over Britain and destroys most of Britain's maritime traffic, then Germany can expect to slowly stir up the hearts of the British people and gradually achieve the goal of forcing Britain to surrender. This is an extremely difficult project, which is very different from the "blitzkrieg" against France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Poland. However, the possibility of this project succeeding also does not seem to be very high. If it cannot be realized, Germany only has one way to take: long-term warfare, that is, to do its best to expand its naval power, as well as the air power that supports its naval power; at the same time, to use all methods to resist Britain's increasingly tight blockade.</p>
<p>The fundamental strategies of both sides are roughly like this. And the significance of the fierce air battles between the two sides in recent days is that, on the German side, it is to try its best to win air supremacy over British skies, attempting to shake Britain's determination to resist; on the British side, it is to destroy Germany's attempt to repair or utilize the resources of the conquered countries.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing; Four Shot Down by Chinese Forces; Major Fires Break Out Throughout the City; The Lower City Completely Destroyed; Chiang Kai-shek Allocates One Million to Aid Refugees</h3>
<p>Chongqing: 170 aircraft, divided into five groups, invaded Baishiyi and the city at around 2:00 PM on the 20th and dropped bombs, causing fires in various places. Chinese anti-aircraft artillery units used the most skillful techniques to aim and fire, immediately completely shooting down three bombers from the third squad of the second group of the first batch of Japanese aircraft. The remaining aircraft went away with heavy damage. Another aircraft was shot down while passing through Zigui Yushuwan, and three Japanese pilots were captured. The air raid alarm in Chongqing was lifted at 3:00 PM. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Since 1:20 this afternoon, after Japanese aircraft again carried out a heavy bombing of China's wartime capital, four-fifths of Chongqing has become a pile of rubble. The embers of the fire that stretched for a mile yesterday have not yet been extinguished. This afternoon, three groups of Japanese aircraft, totaling 77, dropped dozens of incendiary bombs here again. The raging fire rose to the sky again. An Associated Press reporter inspected various parts of the city this afternoon and saw a fire in the eastern part of the city, protruding onto the Yangtze River, that was 1,000 meters long and 600 meters wide. Next to this roaring fire were the broken walls left behind by yesterday's air raid. All modern commercial buildings have been razed to the ground, while one-fifth of the thatched huts and ancient-style buildings still stand. This ancient Chongqing brick city, built during the Chinese Han Dynasty, seems to be becoming a white wasteland after repeated bombings by Japanese aircraft. According to eyewitnesses, when three groups of Japanese aircraft concentrated their bombing on the prosperous eastern city, Chinese anti-aircraft guns shot down one Japanese aircraft. In addition to the fire here, a major fire also broke out in the Jiangbei area across the Jialing River. Residents of Chongqing took refuge in underground rooms in the heat of 94 degrees Fahrenheit for four hours and did not come out until 3:00 PM. According to initial estimates, at least 2,000 people were displaced by today's fire, but it is heard that there were not many deaths or injuries. It is also heard that 2,000 people were left homeless by yesterday's fire. Yesterday's fire was not mostly extinguished until night, and the number of deaths and injuries is officially estimated to be over a hundred. According to an official announcement, one group of yesterday's air raid, totaling ninety aircraft, took off from a base in Hankou, crossed Luxian and Rongchang, and attacked Dazongba (transliteration). Another group, also of ninety aircraft, took off from a Japanese base in southern Jin. It was they who heavily bombed Chongqing. The Methodist Church suffered quite a loss. Its hospital was directly hit, and the roof was pierced. Bombs also fell near the Scottish Bible Society, almost causing an accident. After the air raid, the fire brigade immediately worked hard to extinguish the fires everywhere. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This afternoon, four groups of Japanese aircraft raided Chongqing, starting three fires. The fires caused by yesterday's air raid near the western suburbs and the west gate are still burning. It has now been confirmed that a total of 190 Japanese aircraft participated in yesterday afternoon's air raid. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: As a result of the Japanese aircraft dropping tons of incendiary bombs in the center of Chongqing in the past 24 hours, the lower city of Chongqing has practically ceased to exist. The so-called upper section of the city was completely destroyed by fire after 190 Japanese aircraft heavily bombed it yesterday afternoon. The lower section of the city was destroyed during four groups of Japanese air raids this afternoon. The buildings of the well-known British companies Swire Group and Butterfield &amp; Swire have been destroyed. Butterfield &amp; Swire is the oldest foreign trading company in Chongqing, serving as an agent for HSBC, Jardine Matheson, and several insurance companies. A Reuters reporter passed through the bombed area of ​​the upper section of the city to the lower section of the city after this afternoon's air raid and saw that many houses were on fire. Due to the strong wind, the fire spread very quickly, and hundreds of people are feared to have been buried in the fire. Most of the fires were caused by incendiary bombs. All troops, military police, engineering teams, and volunteers have been mobilized to fight the fire and maintain order. The extent of the destruction is far greater than the bombing in May of last year. After the third batch of Japanese aircraft dropped bombs this afternoon, a Reuters reporter immediately went out from the air-raid shelter and witnessed 27 Japanese bombers flying low and circling over the lower city, presumably to scout the results of the bombing and take photos. The anti-aircraft artillery units fiercely bombarded them, but as far as is known so far, no Japanese aircraft has been shot down. The total number of deaths and injuries in the past two days is more than a thousand. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Japanese aircraft indiscriminately bombed the commercial and residential areas of the city, and more incendiary bombs than explosive bombs were used. The disaster area has spread very widely. President Chiang Kai-shek is extremely concerned about the affected compatriots and has ordered an additional one million yuan to be allocated as relief funds, to be handed over to the Air Raid Service Relief Joint Office to be properly distributed, and to provide double the relief to the affected compatriots, in order to provide relief. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: It was just reported by a certain foreigner here that when Japanese aircraft attacked Hengyang on the 16th of this month, the American Presbyterian Hospital and four foreign buildings near it were completely burned down, with losses amounting to 100,000 yuan. (20th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chinese Forces Near Xiaodong Capture Two Strongholds</h3>
<p>Binyang: When the Chinese army in southern Guangxi attacked the Japanese near Xiaodong, it had already achieved the expected results. Yesterday, the Chinese army launched another fierce attack on the two strongholds of Qinglingwei and Fenghuang (both northwest of Xiaodong), which were occupied by the Japanese, and rushed into the Japanese positions, immediately recovering the two strongholds and capturing a large number of spoils. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Wuming: The Japanese trapped in Funan Yangwei and other places gathered a part of their forces and harassed Longtougen Zhuliujun (northeast of Funan) on the 15th. Chinese forces have been fighting back separately, and fierce battles are still ongoing. (20th dispatch)</p>

Fierce fighting continued until night, killing many Japanese. The Japanese then sent large reinforcements, and the Chinese army launched a head-on attack, returning with victory. (19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Lin Yutang Left Chongqing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The renowned Chinese writer Lin Yutang was recently dispatched by the National Government to foreign countries for research work. Mr. Lin, along with his wife and daughters, departed from Chongqing by plane this morning. It is said that they will reside abroad for a year. Before boarding the plane, Mr. Lin told a United Press reporter that he would return to Chongqing after a year. He also mentioned that to avoid Japanese air raids, he had lived in a mountain about fifty miles north of Chongqing for four months. He felt that China's unprecedented war of resistance had an intangible force within it. He received the government order two weeks ago and has now abandoned his original plan to travel in inland China and stay in China until the final victory. (United Press, 20th)</p>

<h3>Dozens of French Warships Arrived at Ports in Vietnam; Franco-Japanese Negotiations Still in Progress</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The "Nichinichi Shimbun" quoted a Hong Kong "Daily Telegraph" report stating that thirty to forty French warships have arrived at various ports in French Indochina. It is said that most of these warships came from Madagascar in Africa. (Haitong Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Vichy - According to well-informed sources here, negotiations between France and Japan regarding the Vietnam issue did not break down yesterday.

<h3>Sino-Soviet Cooperation Becomes Closer</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - According to reliable sources in Chongqing today, because the Moscow Comintern decided that the Chinese Communist Party should support the government at least during the war of resistance, the friction between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, which had once reached a critical stage, has now been eliminated. This shift indicates that after the closure of the Yunnan-Burma and Yunnan-Vietnam routes, and the Sino-Soviet transportation route becoming China's only supply line, cooperation between China and the Soviet Union has become closer. Recently, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov delivered a speech praising China's resistance to aggression, which was uniformly praised by the Chinese newspapers here, stating that they did not believe that the Soviet Union would join hands with Japan and participate in any new actions in the Pacific. Since the Communist Party has rejoined in supporting the Chongqing government, the rumors of Sino-Japanese reconciliation emanating from Tokyo have no basis. The Chinese Communist Party and Communist parties around the world are also in close contact with the Moscow Comintern, which advocates full support for China's war effort. Furthermore, it has been learned here that in order to increase transportation from the Soviet Union to China, a branch line of the Siberian Railway will be built to connect the southwestern part of Xinjiang Province, near the northern Indian border. According to Japanese sources here today, Chongqing is also making further contacts with the United States, Germany, and Italy. Various parties here, in close contact with Chongqing, did not deny the above news. At the same time, there are many rumors about the mission of Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, who arrived here a few days ago. "Ta Kung Pao" denied that Sun Ke or Zhu Jiahua were in Hong Kong, but some people have indeed seen Sun Ke on the beach near his hometown. It is widely believed that Mr. Sun came here to visit the newly appointed Acting Governor of Hong Kong, Lieutenant General Nordan. (International News Agency, 20th)</p>

<h3>Japan's Economic Controls Fail to Work</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to local newspapers, since the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry jointly promulgated economic control measures two years ago, police in various parts of Japan have uncovered more than 480,000 cases of violations. Most of these were due to negligence or misunderstanding at the beginning of the implementation, but in recent cases, it has been found that some people, driven by greed, knowingly committed offenses. As for the nature of the cases, most involved attempting to smuggle goods to the occupied areas of China to avoid controls. There are currently 5,400 police officers and 550 staff members engaged in investigations across the country. (Havas, 20th)</p>

<h3>US Prepares to Lease British Military Strongholds in the Western Hemisphere; US-Canada Joint Defense Underway; Morgenthau Departs for Canada</h3>
<p>Hyde Park - It was heard yesterday that President Roosevelt will soon announce that the United States is preparing to purchase or lease major British bases in the Western Hemisphere. It is widely believed that British Prime Minister Churchill has expressed his agreement. The United States can effectively lease any British base from Newfoundland to British Guiana. Mr. Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King returned here yesterday after meeting in Ogdensburg and observing army exercises there. The President and Mr. King have agreed to form a joint US-Canada committee to plan the defense of the Western Hemisphere. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Ottawa - The Canadian government stated yesterday that it will proceed quickly to ensure that the US-Canada mutual defense agreement can be implemented as soon as possible. Canadian Prime Minister King has discussed the plan agreed upon with President Roosevelt in Ogdensburg, New York, on Sunday with Defense Minister Ralston. Canada also convened a cabinet meeting today to approve the agreement between Mr. King and President Roosevelt and to decide on the dispatch of Canadian personnel to participate in the US-Canada Joint Defense Committee. Canadians are extremely satisfied with this plan, saying it will achieve a great purpose. Well-informed sources say the mission of this newly established committee will achieve two major steps: (1) to enable the general staffs of the two countries to jointly discuss the defense of the Western Hemisphere; (2) to plan a broad and complete policy for the defense forces of the two countries, so that the two countries can cooperate in careful planning. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>New York - US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau departed yesterday for an undisclosed location in Canada, where he is expected to stay for about two weeks.

<p>US Fleet to Patrol Canadian Territorial Waters</p>
<p>New York - Today, the New York Times Washington correspondent stated that some diplomats expect that as a result of the meeting between President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King this week, US destroyers may patrol Canadian territorial waters. If US warships are indeed used for this purpose, then British destroyers or other warships can be proportionally redeployed to serve in British territorial waters. This move would be equivalent to dispatching US destroyers while avoiding legal obstacles. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>US-Canada Defense Committee to Convene Soon</p>
<p>New York - Sources in Washington announced that the permanent US-Canada Defense Committee will hold its first meeting next week. Members of the US Congress, such as isolationist Senator Vandenberg, are supportive of negotiations for the conclusion of a military agreement between the United States and Canada, saying that all of this is within the scope of the Monroe Doctrine and the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Therefore, it is widely believed that the US-Canada military agreement will eventually be submitted to the Senate for discussion. Political and academic figures point out that this move is clearly a step by President Roosevelt to abandon the United States' isolationist policy. Well-informed sources also solemnly pointed out that because Canada is about to become a belligerent country, taking various defense measures regarding Canada will inevitably change this situation. (Haitong Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>New York - The New York Herald Tribune stated yesterday regarding the agreement made by President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King on the formation of a joint US-Canada committee to defend the Western Hemisphere, but said that the plan "is not yet fully thorough." The newspaper said, "This is not a complete mutual assistance agreement signed by representatives of both countries to deal with emergencies, nor is it a complete understanding that can be implemented immediately, as security issues require. However, the President has clearly begun to act." (United Press, 20th)</p>
<p>Purpose and Scope of the US-Canada Agreement</p>
<p>Washington - Welles told reporters today that the US-Canada agreement has been communicated to the countries of South America.

<h3>Canada Builds Torpedo Boat Fleet</h3>
<p>Ottawa - The Canadian Navy Department announced yesterday that Canada has ordered a fleet of motor torpedo boats similar to Germany's E-boats. These mosquito fleets' torpedo boats are small but powerful, and can travel at 50 nautical miles per hour. This fleet will operate on both the east and west coasts under the guidance of the Canadian Navy. The Canadian Navy is more than six times larger than it was a year ago, with 113 warships and 95 more under construction. Yesterday, Canadian Naval Minister MacDonald, in his first remarks to the press, announced that Canada and the United States have mutually dispatched naval and military attachés. When reporters asked about the "material assistance" mentioned in the Ogdensburg Declaration on the formation of a permanent US-Canada joint defense committee, and whether the US would assist Canada with destroyers, Mr. MacDonald said that there was no need to take such measures. The naval attachés will be able to coordinate various issues, but specific issues cannot be discussed until the general staffs have begun consultations. (United Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>German Consul in New York Transferred Out of the United States</h3>

<h3>US-British Joint Defense of the South Pacific is Only a Matter of Time</h3>

<h3>Canada's Embassy to the US Adds Military Attachés</h3>
<p>Ottawa - Colonel Brotel, the current Canadian naval commander of the Pacific coast, and Colonel Leithson have been appointed as naval and military attachés to Washington, respectively. These two positions are newly established, but according to Canadian Naval Minister MacDonald, Brotel's appointment should not be seen as a result of the meeting between President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King. Local sources believe that the arrival of Canadian Air Minister Power and Lieutenant Colonel Ritt, the Canadian naval commander of the east coast, in Newfoundland last night is related to the President Roosevelt's and Prime Minister King's joint defense agreement. There are also speculations that a naval base will be established in Newfoundland, which will be jointly operated by the United States and Canada. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<h3>British Aid to China Committee Asks Government to Reopen the Burma Road; Whether to Reopen After the End of the Blockade Depends on the Situation in Europe</h3>
<p>London - Well-informed sources close to the British government stated that the efforts of liberal and left-wing members of the British Parliament to have the British government guarantee a tougher policy towards Japan and a more friendly policy towards China have failed. A delegation from the Aid to China Committee discussed British Far East policy with British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler at the British Foreign Office for more than an hour yesterday. Yesterday's meeting was similar in nature to the meeting between Lord Cecil, Lord Lytton, and others with British Foreign Minister Halifax last Friday. It is understood that both representatives asked the authorities to allow the "temporary" blockade of the Burma Road to expire, and that the Burma Road must be reopened after October 18, after the three-month period. It is believed here that the British government's policy on the opening of the Burma Road will largely depend on the British war situation at that time. If Britain is fully engaged against Germany at that time, it is doubtful whether Britain will risk conflict with Japan. The delegation also condemned the British Empire's continued supply of military materials to Japan. It is again seen here that British political preference conflicts with Britain's need to expand imperial exports to obtain foreign exchange. Finally, the delegation asked Lord Halifax and Undersecretary of State Butler to approve sufficient gasoline to pass through the Burma Road to supply ambulances of the Chinese Red Cross, which served the wounded and refugees. It is understood that the British government has twice contacted the Japanese side regarding the international joint management of gasoline used only for medical purposes, to be imported into China via the Burma Road, but Japan has not yet replied.

<h3>Japanese Newspaper Predicts US Will Join the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Yomiuri Shimbun recently predicted that the United States will soon join the European war, and said that if the United States joins the war, the resulting instability in the Pacific may cause Japan to abandon its policy of non-involvement in the war. The Hochi Shimbun also stated that the establishment of a joint defense committee between the United States and Canada is a kind of "merger" whose scope has exceeded a mutual defense alliance, and the newspaper advocated that the Japanese government build a "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" with firm determination to respond to the "bold US actions."

<h3>US Senators Begin Investigation of Espionage</h3>

<h3>American Celebrities Strongly Advocate for Immediate Aid to Britain, Met with Opposition from Isolationists</h3>
<p>Philadelphia - U.S. Ambassador to France, Mr. Bullitt, delivered a speech last night at the American Philosophical Society here, urging the United States to immediately aid Britain to prevent its defeat. Mr. Bullitt expressed strong support for the proposal to send fifty U.S. destroyers to Britain, stating that this measure could potentially prevent Germany from rapidly developing and harming the United States. Bullitt warned that the danger the U.S. faces of being attacked by Germany is no less than that faced by France a year ago. He forcefully argued that if Britain were to fall, the U.S. would face the threat of totalitarian powers. Unless the nation takes decisive action, it would be "too late," as it was for France. Bullitt stated that France's failure was due to the French people's mistaken belief that Germany would not attack France, and even if it did, the Maginot Line would protect them. "Maginot Line" was a phrase uttered so readily, yet it became the death knell for France. Now, we must realize that the phrase "Atlantic Ocean" is also readily spoken and is being used by totalitarian propagandists in the hope that it will become the death knell for the United States. Bullitt stated that if the British navy were to be defeated, the situation would inevitably shift to the U.S.'s "Atlantic Maginot Line." He further explained that there have been three attacks across the Atlantic in the past, two of which were British attacks on the U.S. In one of these two instances, the U.S. capital was burned. The third was Napoleon's occupation of Mexico. If the British fleet fails, the totalitarian powers will possess far more warships and shipbuilding facilities than the U.S. The combined fleet of totalitarian nations in the Atlantic would have almost equal power to our own, capable of cutting off all our commerce with Europe and Africa and threatening our transportation in the southern hemisphere. Bullitt also stated that he personally witnessed the fall of France. In his view, France's failure stemmed from disagreements among the French people regarding social reform and civil liberties. Bullitt continued that the French were not unprepared militarily. However, when the issue arose of adopting compulsory military service and mobilizing the entire nation to defend the country, even when temporary measures were introduced to save French liberty, many French people preferred to listen to divisive enemy propaganda, such as the claim that compulsory military service would sacrifice individual liberty, and that individual liberty should never be temporarily sacrificed. To such people, working forty hours a week was more important than having sufficient aircraft for the nation. They also believed that emergency measures concerning national service were imitating totalitarian states, unaware that this protection of individual liberty was leading to the destruction of the freedom of the French nation. Furthermore, the French government, at one point, succumbed to arguments against aircraft production, destroying thirty-seven aircraft produced each month, while Germany was producing one thousand aircraft per month. Many honest French patriots and Democrats protected the Communist Party, believing that in a democratic country, the Communist Party should have the right to speak. By the time they discovered that the Communist Party was engaged in espionage, acting as special agents for dictatorial states, and using the guise of a political party to carry out conspiracies under the direction of foreign dictators, it was too late to salvage the situation. Bullitt urged the American people to support the draft plan and to support the views of General Pershing, the commander of the U.S. forces in the previous European war, and others who advocated using U.S. destroyers to assist Britain in its current crisis. Bullitt said, "If you do not respond to this appeal, the British fleet is doomed. Do you know what this means for you and the entire American people? Great Britain and Ireland could form an economic bloc with continental Europe under the leadership of Berlin. The productive capacity of this economic bloc will far exceed that of the United States, and its capacity to manufacture warships may be five times greater than that of the United States." (United Press dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Ottawa - Colonel Breckinridge, former Assistant Secretary of War in President Wilson's cabinet, recently broadcast to the entire nation of Canada at the request of the Canadian Minister of Information, stating, "What I hope for from my country is that the United States will draw its sword to fight for freedom and humanity. I pay tribute to Canada, which has no doubts. For their own benefit, and in terms of both wisdom and courage, the countries of the Western Hemisphere should follow Canada's example and provide unreserved assistance to Britain. If the Americas remain asleep and Britain falls, the Americas will awaken to regret it too late. The world cannot survive in a state of half-slavery and half-freedom. Hitler knows this, and therefore drives his nation, whose forte is trampling on others, to destroy the last bastion of freedom." (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Washington - U.S. isolationists have recently harshly criticized the pro-British speech given by the U.S. Ambassador to France on Sunday evening. Bullitt had listed the reasons for France's failure in his speech, warned the U.S. that the U.S. would be in danger once the British fleet was defeated, and urged the U.S. to help Britain with destroyers to prevent Nazi expansion and aggression in the Western Hemisphere. Representative Schafer, a Republican from Wisconsin, even called Bullitt a member of the Fifth Column because of his remarks, advocating for his imprisonment. Senator Clark, a Democrat from Missouri, even called Bullitt disloyal to the country. Senator Wheeler, a Democrat from Montana, said that nothing could be more likely to draw the U.S. into war than Bullitt's actions. (United Press dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Romanian-Bulgarian Negotiations on Territorial Division Soon to Conclude in Agreement, Hungarian Representative Returns Home for Instructions, Romanian-Hungarian Negotiations Postponed</h3>
<p>Craiova - Well-informed observers here have declared that the agreement between Romania and Bulgaria regarding the cession of Southern Dobruja may be concluded as early as the 5 PM meeting today. Although there are still some difficulties concerning the city of Silistra, both sides have expressed their willingness to resolve them in the quickest way possible. Issues such as compensation and exchange of people will be left for discussion in future negotiations. (Haitong dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Bucharest - Representatives from Romania and Bulgaria held their second meeting in Craiova yesterday afternoon at 5 PM. It is widely expected that these negotiations will result in an agreement for Romania to cede Dobruja to Bulgaria. If so, the strategically important area of Silistra on the Danube River will belong to Bulgaria. Technical details such as population exchange and compensation still need to be discussed. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Budapest - Mr. Horthy, the head of the Hungarian delegation, has been ordered to return to Budapest to report on the progress of negotiations with Romania. It is widely expected that the Hungarian government's response to Romania will be submitted only after Horthy returns home. (Haitong dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Severin - The Romanian-Hungarian negotiations, originally scheduled to resume yesterday afternoon, have been postponed because the Hungarian delegation still needs to consult with the Hungarian government in Budapest to refine the details of the Hungarian response to the counter-proposal made by Romania yesterday morning. At 6 PM, Mr. Horthy, the leader of the Hungarian delegation, did not arrive, and the Hungarian minister, Bardossy, attended in his place, but then announced the postponement until 8:30 PM. According to well-informed sources, the southern border proposed by Hungary last Friday is as follows: starting from the western border of Romania, extending eastward through Briliard to the borders of Comitat Arad and Hunedoara, then northward along the borders of Comitat, from Bor to the southern border of Comitat and Cluj, then through Comitat and Turda to Tanava, southward to the village of Sataron, and then northeast and northward along the old Hungarian-Romanian border. (Haitong dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Severin - According to sources close to the Romanian and Hungarian delegations, Hungary is demanding that Romania cede approximately 102,000 square kilometers of land, but Romania is only willing to exchange populations and modify borders to align with ethnic boundaries. According to neutral estimates, Romania is willing to cede only a quarter or a fifth of what Hungary is demanding. The core of the issue is the population statistics. According to Romanian statistics from 1930, there are only 1,200,000 to 1,500,000 Hungarians in the area. Romania also cites Hungarian statistics from 1910, which showed only 1,644,296 Hungarians at the time. However, Hungary claims that the number of Hungarians is 2,500,000.

<h3>United States Massively Stockpiling Rubber</h3>
<p>New York - The amount of rubber stockpiled by the United States for national defense will increase from 180,000 tons to over 400,000 tons. The Rubber Reserve Company recently stated that it will purchase 190,000 tons of rubber in 1941 at a price of 17.75 to 18.5 cents per pound. It is reported that the United States already has 85,000 tons of scrap rubber in stock and has ordered 150,000 tons. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London - The British Colonial Office stated yesterday that after repeated negotiations between the U.S. government and the International Rubber Regulation Committee, an agreement has been reached for the United States to continue purchasing rubber through normal trade channels. After the 150,000 tons of rubber agreed upon on June 29 of this year is fully purchased, the U.S. company will increase its rubber reserves to 330,000 tons and ship it to the U.S. by December 1941, to the greatest extent possible. The on-board delivery price for standard crêpe rubber, packed in boxes or bales, will be at least US 17.75 cents per pound and at most 18.5 cents per pound. It is not yet known whether this transaction will be handled through London or purchased directly from Singapore or Batavia, so market participants are not offering any comments at this time.

<p>A Town on the Southeast Coast of England - The British Air Force yesterday again attacked coastal areas in France with a large number of bombs. The flashes of explosions and anti-aircraft fire could be seen from every church steeple. During the last British attack, a fire blazed straight into the sky. It is widely believed that this fire was caused by incendiary bombs. The sound of the bomb explosions could be heard 20 miles away. (United Press dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London - An Air Ministry communiqué stated that on Sunday night and Monday morning, large formations of British aircraft attacked Italian and German territory and occupied areas of France. No aircraft were lost. British heavy bombers attacked the Caproni aircraft factory in Milan and the Fiat aircraft factory in Turin again on Sunday night, the third attack in a week. According to the Air Ministry Intelligence Office, other British aircraft flew to Rheinfelden, near the border between Germany and Switzerland, and heavily bombed an aluminum plant, causing heavy damage. Another British aircraft flew approximately 600 miles to the vicinity of the Rhine River and bombed a factory for 90 minutes. The first batch of large bombs toppled chimneys, and subsequent bombs hit the target, causing fires that spread rapidly. A hydroelectric plant equipped with generators was also set on fire. The electrochemical plant in Walshet was also attacked and set on fire. British aircraft also bombed a German airfield north of Basel. It is believed that a munitions depot was hit and exploded. The Mulhouse airfield in Alsace was also bombed. Furthermore, British bombers attacked the port of Boulogne in France amidst dense searchlights and intense anti-aircraft fire, achieving considerable success. A large fire quickly broke out in the port, and the flames soared, illuminating the sky. The explosions could be heard across the sea in England. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>German Artillery Bombards England, Range Reaches 100 Miles, London Feels Threatened</h3>
<p>London - According to current news, German long-range guns have bombarded the southeastern coast of England, and the steel fragments have been inspected. Experts have determined that the fragments are from shells fired from the French coast. It is said that there is no technical difficulty in manufacturing cannons with a range of 100 miles, but it is extremely expensive and difficult to aim accurately. Opinions here believe that cannons with such long-range capabilities will have no value other than causing nuisance. However, London will be within the range of these cannons, so there is a possibility that stray shells will fly into the capital at any time. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London - According to a reliable British news agency, it is generally believed here that German high-velocity heavy guns have already bombarded towns on the southeastern coast of England. According to Dutch radio, these shells were fired from guns in Elesseum Meter. If so, then the weight of these shells must be between 30 and 35 pounds. However, based on the evidence in the hands of military experts in London, the guns firing on England are larger than those in Elesseum Meter. (United Press dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Skies Over England Relatively Calm Yesterday, Only Small Squadrons of German Aircraft Continuously Attack, Heavy Losses for Germans in Seven Days of Aerial Combat</h3>
<p>London - The skies over England were relatively calm again this morning. Only a few enemy aircraft came to attack. A German aircraft that attacked a coastal town in Suffolk at dawn was shot down into the sea by British fighters. Another German aircraft bombed a town in Wales, causing several casualties. A total of five enemy aircraft were shot down yesterday, and British fighters lost three, but both pilots escaped safely. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London - After several days of intense air raids on England, yesterday was relatively quiet, with only small squadrons of German aircraft continuously flying over England, attempting to attack. According to incomplete reports received by the Air Ministry, it is confirmed that four enemy aircraft were shot down by British fighters. All four German aircraft were individual attackers and were shot down. A single enemy aircraft dropped a bomb on East Anglia, killing three civilians and injuring several. British fighters intercepted the enemy aircraft and are believed to have shot it down. Last night, enemy aircraft flew over the northwest, southeast, and northeast of the Metropolis district. Three incendiary bombs were dropped in a certain district in the northeast and caught fire, but were quickly extinguished. Official disclosures state that in the seven days of aerial combat up to yesterday, no fewer than 571 enemy aircraft were shot down, including 516 shot down by British fighters, including 380 fighter-bombers. Officials recently received reports that another three German bombers were destroyed on Sunday, bringing the total number of German losses that day to 144. Two of the three German aircraft were shot down by British aircraft off the coast, and the other was collided with and destroyed by a British Anson training aircraft, falling to the ground together. The British aircraft was not equipped with weapons, and it is unknown whether the pilot deliberately collided with the German aircraft and perished together. Yesterday, houses were damaged by bombing in a certain town in Essex and a certain town in Norfolk. In a certain town on the southeast coast, an enemy aircraft dropped four bombs and strafed rooftops before fleeing in panic out to sea. Two houses were damaged by the bombing, with slight casualties. A shipyard in South Wales was attacked yesterday, but only one oil pool was hit and caught fire. Several British airfields were also bombed. According to a Reuters air force correspondent, observers strongly emphasized the characteristics of Britain's hope to break German air superiority, with the following arguments: (1) The German aircraft lost almost a quarter of their attackers on Sunday; (2) The destruction of an entire German squadron was a first; (3) Anti-aircraft defenses were effective; (4) German aircraft attacked London, the most heavily defended city in the world, during the day; (5) British fighters are seeking to answer the question of how the Germans plan to invade or blockade; (6) The Germans cannot maintain their blockade of England at the current rate of aircraft loss, as they have lost nearly a thousand aircraft since June 18; (7) Britain controls the English Channel through the activities of its air force and navy; (8) The Germans will not now invade Britain using their tactic of using the air force to command the army; (9) The Germans may intensify the bombing of British airfields and aircraft production centers, and the German air force may once again come to England to inflict wanton destruction and terror. At the same time, it is expected that the British Air Force will also intensify its attacks on German territory and German-occupied areas in addition to self-defense.

<h3>Germany Warns England Not to Mistreat Paratroopers, or Reprisals Will Be Taken</h3>
<p>Berlin - Germany formally issued a warning to England last night not to mistreat German paratroopers. This warning seems to be a prelude to an invasion attempt of England. The German Foreign Office sent a document, entrusted to Swiss officials, to London, detailing the uniforms and clear markings of the paratroopers. The German side threatened the British side, saying that if the British "violate international law" and mistreat German paratroopers, the German response will be severe reprisals against captured British airmen. German authorities say Germany will intensify its offensive in the next ten days, using thousands of aircraft, dozens of submarines, and a large fleet of torpedo boats. (International News Service dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London - Responsible sources here claim that the British government has not yet received Germany's correspondence regarding the treatment of German paratroopers. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Regarding the excerpts of Germany's remarks to England, which stated that Germany would retaliate if England treated German paratroopers in violation of international law, according to international law authorities, it is a serious violation of international law to use civilians to resist paratroopers, as they are non-combatants. However, if they join the regular army for combat without combatant markings, they will be regarded as plainclothes soldiers. The same applies if they participate in other military actions, and certain customary retaliatory measures can be used in accordance with the provisions of international law. (Haitong dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>A Strange Story Amidst the Sudden Raids: A Blind Person Regains Sight</h3>
<p>Berlin - In a small town near Hanover, when an air raid alarm was issued, a blind person accidentally regained sight in one eye. When the alarm sounded, the blind person hurried to the cellar, fumbled in the dark, lost his footing, and fell, hitting the back of his head against the edge of the bed frame. When he woke up the next morning, one of his eyes had regained sight. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Refugee Ship Sails Through Danger Zone, Germany Expresses Concern</h3>
<p>Washington - The German ambassador here declared yesterday that if the U.S. refugee ship "American Legion" does not comply with the warning to change its course, then the responsibility for its safety must be borne entirely by the U.S. The U.S. official spokesperson said that the ship was carrying 897 refugees from Finland to New York and has now entered a "danger zone, which it must traverse in 12 hours to be out of harm's way." The spokesperson also said that there is no chance that the ship will be intentionally damaged, but "the German government reiterated its concern" because the area is mined. (International News Service dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - The U.S. Minister to Sweden, Mr. Sterling, said this morning that the captain of the U.S. ship "American Legion" said that the ship would be able to pass through the danger zone tonight. (Haitong dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Vichy Government Emphasizes Civil Affairs, Focuses on Developing Agriculture and Industry</h3>
<p>Vichy - The French government recently announced that a controlled economy has replaced the free economy. From now on, all French military industrial factories will be converted into industrial factories. All tanks, aircraft, cannons, and bombs will be converted into agricultural machinery, automobiles, typewriters, and similar products. In the past, France relied on the United States for products, accounting for three-quarters of the nation's products. Now, all ordnance factories should be converted to manufacture these needed products. (United Press dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>British Troops Partially Depart Shanghai Today; Two Defense Zones Handed Over Yesterday; Central Zone Taken Over by Volunteer Corps Last Night; US-Japan Diplomatic Negotiations to Commence Immediately</h3>
<p>The British troops scheduled to withdraw from Shanghai are already equipped and ready to depart. The two defense zones previously under British control were handed over yesterday morning (the 20th). Starting at 9:00 AM, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces took over Zone D. The Defense Forces Conference resolved that the US military would take over Zone B. According to a public statement issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office yesterday, "The Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps will take over the defense of Zone 'B' tonight (August 20th) at 8:00 PM, according to a temporary reconciliation plan." Three hundred members of the British East Surrey Regiment will march from their barracks this afternoon to the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf to board the De Sheng Steamer and leave Shanghai. The remaining British troops will depart on the 26th of this month. The arrangements for the British troops to proceed through Hongkou to the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf for embarkation were finalized yesterday morning by the Japanese naval authorities and British military officers. At that time, the US Navy's Fourth Marine Regiment will hold a farewell ceremony for the departing British troops, but the plan has not yet been fully finalized. The baggage of the troops departing today began to be transported from the Western District to the Central District by British military trucks yesterday at noon. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>US-Japan Discussions to Resolve the Issue</p>
<p>United Press International, Washington, 20th: US Acting Secretary of State Welles announced yesterday that the US Navy Department had notified Rear Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, that the US government could agree to the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps patrolling Defense Zone B of the Shanghai Public Concession after the British troops withdraw. Welles stated that the US considers the plan for the Volunteer Corps to patrol the British defense zone a temporary measure pending the outcome of discussions between the US and Japanese governments regarding the US Marine Corps taking over the defense of British Zone B. US Ambassador to Japan Grew has also been informed of this decision. Welles hopes that US-Japan discussions will lead to a mutually satisfactory resolution.</p>
<p>Far East Interests Should Be Upheld</p>
<p>United Press International, New York, 20th: "The New York Times," in an editorial yesterday entitled "The American Navy in Shanghai," expressed satisfaction with the position taken by the State Department, Rear Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, and Colonel Baker, Commander of the US Marine Corps in Shanghai, regarding the divergence of US-Japan opinions on the disposition of the British defense zone in Shanghai. The newspaper said, "At a time when other countries are being forced to abandon their long-standing interests in the Far East, it is rare for a country to insist on its established rights."</p>
<p>East Surrey Regiment to Depart Today</p>
<p>The English "China Press" reported that the handover of the two districts formerly defended by British troops stationed in Shanghai began this morning (the 20th). Starting at 9:00 AM, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces took over the "D" defense zone, and the International Volunteer Corps is expected to take over the defense of the "B" defense zone starting at 8:00 PM tonight. Three hundred British soldiers of the East Surrey Regiment will depart from their barracks shortly after noon tomorrow (the 21st), marching in formation to the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf in Hongkou to board the De Sheng Steamer and set sail. The remaining British troops are expected to leave Shanghai on August 26th. It is reported that British military officers and Japanese naval authorities finalized the arrangements this morning for the British troops to travel through Hongkou to board the ship. The US Navy's Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai will hold a farewell ceremony for the British troops, but the plan has not yet been finalized. The personal belongings of the British soldiers departing tomorrow began to be transported this afternoon. British military trucks carrying boxes and luggage are traveling from the Western District to the Central District.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Took Over Zone D Yesterday</p>
<p>After the Japanese Naval Landing Forces took over the buildings formerly occupied by British troops in Defense Zone "D" this morning, they immediately began preliminary defense work. It is not yet known whether the Japanese troops will occupy the barracks formerly used by the British, but it is generally believed that the British and Japanese military authorities have reached an agreement on this step.</p>
<p>Volunteer Corps Russian Unit Takes Over Zone B</p>
<p>Meanwhile, senior officers of the Shanghai International Volunteer Corps told reporters that Defense Zone "B," currently guarded by British soldiers of the West Suffolk Regiment, will be handed over to the Russian unit of the Volunteer Corps. However, due to the small number of personnel in this unit, it is feared that they will not be able to fully take over the tasks within Defense Zone "B," as the Russian unit, including officers, only has slightly more than 300 men, while the West Suffolk Regiment has a total of 800 men.</p>
<p>Insufficient Personnel in Russian Unit for Deployment</p>
<p>Furthermore, among the 300 men of the Russian unit, 87 are assigned to routine duties within the Public Concession on a daily basis, excluding 22 Volunteer Corps members who drive vehicles and 8 who serve as messengers. 41 men are required to guard the wharves along the Bund, and 28 men are guarding the Lone Army Barracks on Jiaozhou Road. In addition, 18 men are assigned to guard the Shanghai Municipal Council Building on the Bund. Therefore, 87 men are actively engaged in defense duties on a daily basis. There are also 30 Volunteer Corps members permanently stationed at the headquarters of the International Volunteer Corps, ready to be deployed in case of any emergency. Therefore, a total of 117 Volunteer Corps members in the Russian unit are unable to take on other duties. This number accounts for more than one-third of the unit's total personnel.</p>
<p>Municipal Council Holds Secret Meeting</p>
<p>This morning, a Washington dispatch reported that the US government had agreed to the plan to change the defense arrangements in the Public Concession. The Municipal Council directors also held a "secret" meeting this morning. Shortly before 10:00 AM, reporters saw Municipal Council Chairman Cornell and several directors gathering at the Municipal Council Building. However, the council's spokesperson denied that a directors' meeting had been held this morning.</p>
<h3>Rear Admiral Hart Left Shanghai for Qingdao Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet, left Shanghai yesterday at noon aboard the Isabel yacht after the issue of the Zone B defense zone was temporarily resolved. It is generally believed that Hart's destination is Qingdao.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Travel South Next Week; Scheduled to Depart by Ship for Hong Kong on the 26th</h3>
<p>British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr is about to leave Shanghai for Chongqing to strengthen close cooperation between China and Britain. However, opinions vary on the ambassador's travel schedule. A Ping Ming News Agency reporter specifically inquired with those close to the British Ambassador yesterday. It is said that the Ambassador has decided to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong next Monday, the 26th of this month. After a brief stay in Hong Kong, he will fly to Chongqing to meet with the Chinese government authorities. The English "China Press" reported that British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr will leave Shanghai for Chongqing on August 26th, first traveling by ship to Hong Kong, but the name of the ship is not yet known. After arriving in Hong Kong, the Ambassador will transfer to a flight to Chongqing. It is not yet known how long he will stay. It is noted that the Ambassador returned to Shanghai after a brief rest in Beidaihe, and his wife is still staying in Beidaihe.</p>
<h3>US Ships Leaving Port; Unconfirmed Reports of Four Submarines Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet's personal yacht, the Isabel, arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao last Wednesday (the 14th) and was moored at the British naval pontoon on the Yangjingbang River. It is now known that the yacht weighed anchor at around 11:00 AM (Customs clock) yesterday and left Wusongkou at 1:15 PM, presumably heading back to Qingdao. As for the rumors that four US submarines that came to Shanghai will leave Shanghai today, and that the submarine rescue ship "Pigeon" left Shanghai on the 19th, there is no confirmed news.</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Xu Yongzuo and Xu Maotang's Whereabouts; Some Say They Were Transferred Out of Shanghai; French Concession Still Denies It</h3>
<p>Since Xu Yongzuo and Xu Maotang were arrested by the Japanese authorities in conjunction with the French Concession police, they should have been handed over to the judicial authorities for trial within 24 hours of their arrest, according to the law. However, it is still unknown why the Xu brothers were arrested. It has been over a month since their arrest, and they have not been sent for trial or released. The Xu family's relatives and friends are all suspicious and anxious about this. It was initially reported that the French Concession authorities believed that the Xu brothers were not suspected of any crime and could be released after bail procedures were completed. However, according to recent news from various parties related to the Xu brothers, Xu Maotang's daily necessities used in the Guangci Hospital were returned to his home by the hospital a long time ago, but there has been no sign of him. However, inquiries to Guangci Hospital reveal that the person in question has long since left. It turns out that the previous report of a possible release was based on the assumption that the hospital had sent back the belongings. Now, according to reliable sources, the two Xu brothers have been sent to Jiangning by the Japanese authorities, but the French Concession police authorities firmly deny that the two Xu brothers have left Shanghai. The true situation is truly bewildering.</p>
<h3>Besides Designated Major Native Products, Allowed to be Exempted from Foreign Exchange Settlement and Transported to Shanghai; Exempted from Transit and Export Taxes for Goods Subject to Foreign Exchange Settlement; Effort to Reduce Costs and Promote Sales Abroad</h3>
<p>After the National Government fully encouraged the export of native products, all major goods for which foreign exchange is settled upon export can receive foreign exchange difference subsidies. Now, the commercial exchange rate of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications has been suppressed, allowing native products to be exported continuously and enriching the foreign exchange base. Regarding the transport of native products to Shanghai, except for various goods specifically designated as restricted for transit, all other goods not designated as restricted for transit are:</p>
<p>All Allowed to be Exempted from Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Transported to Shanghai, and there is no need to apply for a domestic sales permit. The goods specifically designated are: in addition to the four categories of hog bristles, tung oil, tea leaves, and minerals under the overall planning and sales of the government, there are 14 categories of egg products, feathers, sausage casings, leather, fur, lattice, medicinal materials, oil wax, kernels, tobacco, wood, cocoons, silk, ramie, and cotton products. Those that have been transported to Shanghai after foreign exchange settlement and then transshipped overseas can be exempted from foreign exchange settlement again, and are also allowed to be exempted from transit and export taxes, in order to reduce costs. Export goods are subject to Central Trust Bureau</p>
<p>Insurance for Troop Support</p>
<p>For those certified by the Trade Commission for export sales, their insurance premiums are specially allowed to be recorded on account, and those who suffer losses after the goods are sold are exempted from paying insurance premiums and paid by the government on their behalf. The government's purpose is to show consideration for merchants and promote export sales. As a result, the transport of native products to Shanghai has increased sharply, and Shanghai Customs' export trade has not only recovered to its old state but has also improved compared with the pre-war situation. Shanghai, which has had a trade deficit for many years, has now turned into a trade surplus. From now on, Shanghai Customs' trade will flourish.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Patrol at Night; Suddenly Encounter Attack</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reported that at 2:20 AM on the 20th, a strange shooting incident occurred on Youheng Road in Hongkou. Two Japanese police officers from the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department were patrolling there and saw two Chinese riding bicycles pass by. The Japanese police stopped them for violating the curfew. Unexpectedly, the two people drew their pistols and shot at the police, firing a total of five shots. Fortunately, none of the shots hit. The Japanese police were very frightened by this sudden attack. After regaining their composure, the two cyclists had already turned into nearby streets and disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<h3>Cheng Zhenzhang Gradually Out of Danger; Received Blood Transfusion Once Yesterday</h3>
<p>Cheng Zhenzhang, an editor of the "China Press" from Hangzhou, was stabbed and injured on Avenue Road two days ago. It is now learned that his condition has improved and is no longer critical yesterday. His temperature was 37.1 degrees the night before. Yesterday morning, at about 10:00 AM, doctors at Guangci Hospital gave him a 200cc blood transfusion, and his condition improved. His temperature was 38.1 degrees, his pulse was steady, and he had started to drink some milk.</p>
<h3>Rush for Stabilized Price Rice; Rice Prices Fall Back</h3>
<p>The fifth phase of stabilized price sale of foreign rice began yesterday at 7:00 AM Shanghai time at 60 locations throughout the city. The number of people reached more than a thousand. Before 10:00 AM, the allocated rice tickets and rice grains at each location had been sold out. Sales will continue tomorrow morning at 7:00 AM. Yesterday, because the fifth phase of stabilized price sale of foreign rice began, ordinary people rushed to buy it, causing sales at rice stores to become sluggish and stagnant. The market immediately showed an oversupply, so prices fell slightly. No. 2 Saigon rice fell by 70 cents, fire-processed rice fell by 30 cents, and Siamese rice fell by one dollar. The prices of other goods also fell by several cents. The new supply of goods from Pudong and other places has gradually become sufficient, so rice prices are expected to gradually return to normal.</p>
<h3>Songmen and Fuqing Approved for Customs Clearance</h3>
<p>Ships Not Yet Reported for Customs Clearance Yesterday; It Seems There is a Turning Point in the Fujian-Zhejiang Shipping; A Central News Agency reporter learned from the Jianghai Customs authorities yesterday that Fuqing at the mouth of Minhai and Songmen at the mouth of Zhehai have resumed customs clearance procedures. Gubei Tou is still allowed to clear customs. Since the Japanese side re-imposed a ban on navigation at the mouths of Zhejiang and Fujian on the 15th of this month, all ports except Gubei Tou were not allowed to clear customs. Sanjiangkou, a port in Fujian Province, was the only shipping lane after the Japanese blockade. Now, due to the interference of Japanese warships in shipping, there are many dangers, so Customs has also stopped clearance. Fuqing is located between Fuzhou and Xinghua. Now that Jianghai Customs has allowed customs clearance there, the Shanghai-Fujian shipping line is likely to shift from Sanjiangkou to Fuqing. However, it is learned that although Songmen and Fuqing Customs have been approved for customs clearance, no ships have reported customs clearance at the above two places yesterday.</p>
<p>Denggao</p>
<p>The Denggao Steamer of the German Russ-Asiatic Lloyd Shipping Company is scheduled to weigh anchor at 4:00 PM on the 24th of this month and sail to Songmen to pick up passengers from Nantian, Jinqinggang, and Juehan near Songmen, and then transfer to Yongzhen inland. The company has already started selling tickets yesterday.</p>
<p>Moufu</p>
<p>The Moufu Steamer of the German Melchers &amp; Co. was still berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf yesterday, and the cargo had not yet been unloaded. The reason it stopped sailing to Gubei Tou was that it was still trying to find a way to resume navigation. According to an observation by a shipping merchant, now that Fuqing in Fujian Province has been approved for customs clearance, the foreign steamship companies in this port will naturally maintain the shipping on that route and send ships to it. The Shanghai-Fujian shipping line, which was interrupted for a week, seems to have a glimmer of hope.</p>
<p>Shenhua</p>
<p>According to Chi Yunfei of the Fujian Fellow Association's report to the Ping Ming News Agency yesterday, nearly 100 passengers who were robbed on the Shenhua Steamer have applied to the association for relief. Summarizing their opinions, they are divided into four categories: (1) Yilong Company must first allocate funds to distribute to the robbed passengers in urgent need of relief to meet emergency needs; (2) Yilong Company must advance the expenses for meals and accommodation for passengers currently staying in various hotels who are unable to manage their own expenses; (3) Once the Shanghai-Fujian shipping is open, the company's first batch of ships should first transport the Shenhua Steamer robbed passengers back to Fujian free of charge; (4) Compensation for various losses from the robbery (according to the amount of losses claimed by each applicant, the numbers are different). The above requirements will be forwarded to Yilong Company by the Shenhua Steamer Disaster Relief Committee. However, since the association received the application forms from the representatives of the victims, it is feared that the procedures are incomplete. Therefore, starting yesterday, the association notified all applicants for relief to come to the association in person to add their fingerprints and signatures to their application forms. Therefore, the above four requirements must be transferred to Yilong Company only after the procedures are completed today or tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Philippines Shipping Line; Dutch Ships Striving to Maintain Service; Modified to Use Faster Ships of Over 6,000 Tons; Direct Sailing from Manila to South Africa</h3>
<p>The Dutch Royal Rotterdam Lloyd Shipping Company's Shanghai-Philippines shipping line passenger ships Bao Shuyun, De Geerberg, and Ross, with a deadweight of more than 15,000 tons, came to Shanghai in 1938 to open the Shanghai to Africa shipping line, passing through Hong Kong, Bangkok, Singapore, Manila, Colombo, and other ports, to South Africa and East Africa. Due to business reasons, the three giant ships such as Bao Shuyun were transferred back.</p>
<p>Focus on Cargo Transportation</p>
<p>Two smaller and faster ships have been dispatched, such as the M/S Straat Soenda and M/S Straat Malakka, with a deadweight of over 6,400 tons, and can be called sister ships. They focus on cargo transportation, so cranes and other machinery are complete and loading and unloading is convenient. There is only a large dining room for passengers, and there are no second, third, or fourth class facilities. According to the company, the first ship, the M/S Sraat Soenda, will arrive in Shanghai this Sunday. It will not stay in Shanghai for long and will soon make its maiden voyage to the Philippines.</p>
<p>Change the Route</p>
<p>In order to speed up the voyage, the route has been slightly changed. The ship will travel from Shanghai to Hong Kong, and directly to Manila, without stopping at Siam, Singapore, and various ports in Southeast Asia. From Manila, it will go directly to South Africa. It used to take one and a half months to travel from Shanghai to South Africa. Now, it only takes 33 days at most. It takes 25 days from Shanghai to Lourenco Marques, 30 days to Capetown, and 33 days to Durban.</p>
<p>Once a Month</p>
<p>This will greatly facilitate the transportation of goods, and the goods to various ports in East Africa and South America will still be transported as usual. It is reported that the second new ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai next month. After that, the sailing schedule will be changed to once a month. The company's local agent is the Java Mail Line at 133 Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Hongqiao Car Accident; Amicably Resolved by British and Japanese; Both Japanese Soldiers Slightly Injured in Car Crash; Chinese Driver Frightened and Missing</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reported that yesterday (the afternoon of the 19th), two Japanese soldiers driving a motor vehicle on Hongqiao Road carelessly collided with the car of Major Marsh, of the British Army's Engineering Corps stationed in Shanghai, causing both of them to be injured. British and Japanese military officers held an amicable conversation this morning (the 20th), and the matter has been resolved.</p>
<p>Two Cars Collide</p>
<p>The incident occurred yesterday afternoon when Major Marsh was playing golf at the Hongqiao Golf Course, and his Chinese driver was driving an empty car back to Shanghai. On the way, it was suddenly hit by a Japanese three-wheeled motor vehicle. Both Japanese soldiers in the car were injured. The driver was frightened and ran away, and has not yet appeared this afternoon.</p>
<p>Responsibility Lies; According to informed sources, after the two cars collided, they both overturned into ditches on the side of the road. Judging from the position of the two cars, this incident was not the fault of the driver. Major Marsh has employed this driver for 18 months, and he has always been cautious in his work and has never caused any accidents. Moreover, Major Marsh's car is an old model and its speed does not exceed 35 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Baseless Rumors</p>
<p>After the accident, Major Marsh and British Army Liaison Officer Major Hunter met with the Japanese authorities this morning to discuss the matter, and it has been resolved. Relevant authorities are quite upset about the baseless rumors about this incident.</p>
<p>According to a message issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office last night, the person driving the car in the Hongqiao car accident mentioned in a certain newspaper was the secretary of the Defense Forces, Mr. G. H. Mann. This is completely inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council "Safety Training Class" Autumn Enrollment Notice; Machine Manufacturing Department; Metal Pressing Department</h3>
<p>Shanghai is full of factories, and due to the lack of safety equipment and the rudimentary education of workers, workers are often directly injured or killed by machines. The Industrial Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of this, has gradually assigned the technical workers employed by various factories to gradually improve the safety of industry, based on the experience of past training classes and according to the classification of various factories. That is, as the saying goes, "Better training results in safer work."</p>
<p>It is now learned that the two departments set up by the training class this autumn are the "Machine Manufacturing Department" and the "Metal Pressing Department," which are about to begin. Now, the methods are described in detail on the left. It is hoped that various factories will quickly select several workers and send a letter to the Industrial Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council at No. 209 Jiangxi Road to register.

<h3>Zhejiang Eastern Mail Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Changde Steamer arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Gubei Tou, carrying a batch of Zhejiang Eastern lightweight mail. Although the quantity is small, it is enough to show that the Post Office has not abandoned the sea mail delivery route.</p>
<h3>Special Court Criminal Division Relocating Office is Untrue; Court Authorities Solemnly Deny It Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was rumored that senior officials of the First Special District Court held a meeting on the 19th and decided to relocate the Criminal Division of the court from North Zhejiang Road to other locations in the Public Concession, and that the houses used by the Civil Division on Weihaiwei Road were insufficient, so they would also be relocated. It was said that this could be realized within the next week or so. According to the authorities in charge of the First Special District Court, this statement is completely a misunderstanding. The court has never considered this.</p>

<h3>Recent Status of Southwest Travel; Can Be Divided into Three Sections from Shanghai to Chongqing; Boat and Car Expenses Should be Budgeted Generously</h3>
<p>Regarding travel to various places in the southwest via Vietnam, judging from the recent traffic conditions, it is still passable, but it is not as smooth as it used to be. The recent traffic conditions from Shanghai to Chongqing via Vietnam are described below, divided into sections:</p>
<p>Shanghai to Haiphong</p>
<p>There are steamers of Taikoo and Jardine two companies operating between them, but the steamer schedule is not as dense as it used to be, and there are also fewer ships operating. Taikoo Company has Taoyuan, Jinan, Qingyuan, Qiongzhou, Shandong, and other ships. Jardine Company only has Taisheng, Yusheng, and Mingsheng. It takes eight days to reach by ship. The third-class fare is 67 yuan in national currency, the cabin fare is 124 yuan, the official cabin is 173 yuan, and the large dining room is 170 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Haiphong to Kunming</p>
<p>The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is still operating as usual, but only slow trains are used. The Michelin express train has long been stopped. The slow train journey takes four days. Recently, in order to strictly inspect passengers entering from the port of He, our authorities have been requiring passengers traveling to Yunnan by train from the port to stay in Hekou for one more day for inspection. As a result, the journey has been increased by one day. In addition, the track of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was once washed away by heavy floods and has now been repaired. Passengers' luggage still cannot be checked and it is stipulated that each passenger must not carry more than 10 kilograms of luggage, but in fact it is impossible to limit. However, it is no more than 30 to 40 kilograms at most. If there is too much luggage, the railway authorities will refuse to carry it. This refers to domestic. In Vietnam, each passenger can carry 350 kilograms of luggage. The first-class fare is 91.78 Vietnamese yuan, the second-class is 63 yuan, the third-class is 36.07 yuan, and the fourth-class is 13 yuan.</p>
<p>Kunming to Chongqing</p>
<p>From Kunming to Chongqing, you can follow the Southwest Company via Guiyang to Chongqing. The entire journey is 1,150 kilometers long and takes six days to reach. The fare is 115 yuan in national currency. Or, you can follow the Sichuan-Yunnan Highway from Kunming via Xuanwei, Weining, Bijie, Xuyong, and to Luzhou. The entire journey is 915 kilometers long and takes four and a half days. The fare is 91.5 yuan in national currency. It takes half a day from Luzhou to Longchang, and the fare is 5.6 yuan. From Longchang, you can reach Chengdu and Chongqing. You can also take a boat to Chongqing instead of a car. However, recently there is a shortage of gasoline in the interior, and the highway bus schedule has also been reduced accordingly. There are also many passengers, so you must register in advance at each place and then take the bus in order. The cost of food and accommodation during the waiting period is quite high. Therefore, those who go to the interior need to have sufficient preparation for travel expenses in order to avoid lack of funds.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Returning Home Allowed Exemption from Military Service for Two Years; Thai Overseas Chinese Treated Similarly</h3>
<p>With the outbreak of the European War, overseas Chinese faced numerous threats to their lives and businesses, leading to a continuous stream of forced returns to their homeland. The authorities are currently building "Overseas Chinese Happiness Villages" in Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces. It has recently been learned that the National Government has issued an order to all provincial governments stating that overseas Chinese returning to the country, upon presenting certificates issued by local governments or passports certified by consulates or chambers of commerce, shall be granted exemption from military service for a period of two years from the date of their return. Furthermore, overseas Chinese from Thailand who are forced to return home but cannot obtain passports, if they possess sufficient proof, may also be treated in accordance with the above regulations, in order to comfort the overseas Chinese community.</p>
<h3>Promising Autumn Harvest in Wuxi; Significant Decrease in Autumn Silkworm Rearing Households</h3>
<p>According to travelers from Wuxi, the price of rice in Wuxi once soared, but now fluctuates around forty-five to forty-six yuan. Since the beginning of summer, there has been a severe drought, causing widespread concern about a disappointing autumn harvest. Fortunately, since the late summer and early autumn, there have been continuous heavy rains. Although early rice has been affected, the middle and late rice crops have already formed ears, and the situation is still good. Recently, new grains are gradually appearing on the market, and it is expected that the autumn harvest will be promising. As for autumn silkworms in the countryside, they have already undergone their first and second molts. Due to the outstanding payments for spring cocoons, there has been a significant decrease in interest in raising autumn silkworms. Furthermore, due to the lack of rain during the summer, the mulberry leaves are exceptionally withered and yellow. The total number of autumn silkworms in the county is less than two-thirds of last year's. The cocoon merchants are also unwilling to commit to purchasing due to the outstanding payments for spring cocoons. In Xin'an Town in the southern countryside, yellow ants have appeared, stinging autumn silkworms, causing them to writhe and die. The villagers hate them intensely but have no way to eliminate them.</p>
<h3>Hsiang Sheng Taxi Recovered After Robbery; Suspect Confesses to Intent to Kidnap; Attempt to Kidnap Manager of D.E.R.C.O. Light Bulb Factory Failed; Suspect Pan Chiang-sheng Transferred to Court for Interrogation Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 9:10 AM the day before yesterday, the Seventh Branch of the Hsiang Sheng Taxi Company on Jiaozhou Road in Western Shanghai received a phone call from a customer requesting a taxi to Sanyifang on Jessfield Road. The company dispatched driver Chien Ah-liang in car number 18562. Upon arrival, two men boarded the car. However, when the car reached Kangjiaqiao, four more men appeared and instructed the driver to drive to the Columbia Road bridge in Fahua Town. One of them pulled out a gun, forced the driver out of the car, and told him to return the car in the area of Tifeng Road and Jessfield Road in half an hour. Then, one of the men drove the car away. The driver immediately reported the incident to the police station, who dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to search for the car. At that time, one of the robbers was driving the car and was intercepted. Upon questioning, he identified himself as Pan Chiang-sheng and confessed that he and others had conspired to kidnap Chung Tsai-ching, the manager of the D.E.R.C.O. Light Bulb Factory at number 874, Lane 40, Lipo Road, but the attempt had failed. He was taken to the police station and transferred to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Li Chih-shan, presented the case and requested a postponement. The court ordered Pan to be detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Suspect in Kidnapping Case, Tung Ju-pai, Died Due to Torture; Deceased's Brother Files Criminal Self-Accusation; Accusing the Victim's Mother and Detectives</h3>
<p>Yang Li-tai, the fifteen-year-old son of a deceased overseas Chinese from Fujian, residing at number 804, Route Pichon, was kidnapped around noon on June 8th as he was returning home from Koukoul Elementary School in Koukoul New Village on Route Courbet. The kidnappers demanded a large ransom. After Yang's mother, Tung (41 years old), reported the case to the French police, detectives arrested five suspects: Shih Kuo-chen, Tung Hsiao-wu-tzu (i.e., Tung Ju-pai), Cheng Ju-sung, Lin Shuang-chuan, and the woman Chen Wang (wife of Chen Er, who drove the car for the kidnappers during the abduction). They were transferred to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention pending investigation. However, one of the suspects, Tung Hsiao-wu-tzu,</p>
<p>became fearful during</p>
<p>police investigation, and violently rammed his head against the wall, causing serious injuries that led to his death. Meanwhile, the detectives worked diligently and rescued the kidnapped victim in a shed in Western Shanghai last month. After investigation, a public prosecution was initiated against Shih, Cheng, and Lin according to the law. Chen Wang was found to be unrelated to the case and was released without prosecution. The trial of the three suspects, Shih, etc., has concluded, and they were declared not guilty the day before yesterday. The part concerning Tung Hsiao-wu-tzu was ruled inadmissible. These details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now,</p>
<p>Tung Hsiao-wu-tzu's</p>
<p>biological brother, Tung Ju-hsueh (41 years old, from Yencheng), and his brother-in-law, Yuan Chin-sheng (46 years old; the two brothers-in-law reside at number 234, Chin Hsiu Lane, Pinlang Road), have hired Sun Chih-hsiang and Chen Kuang-yuan as their lawyers and filed a self-accusation with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court against Yang Tung and Tung Shih-kuan, Shih Chang-chin (ticket collector at the former British Tramway Company), Wang Hai-shan (guard at Koukoul New Village), and four detectives from the French police, accusing them of conspiring to falsely accuse (Tung Hsiao-wu-tzu) of being a thief and</p>
<p>abusing their authority,</p>
<p>resulting in his death through torture. The complaint also alleges that the first defendant, Yang Tung, and the third defendant, Shih Chang-chin, had an adulterous affair. They requested that the court investigate in accordance with Articles 169 and 125 of the law. Based on the complaint, Judge Li Wei-shan presided over the hearing at the First Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. The plaintiffs and their lawyers were present, and the lawyers presented the plaintiff's case. The four defendants and their defense lawyer, Wang Heng-yi, were present and presented their defense, focusing on the</p>
<p>main issue</p>
<p>that the plaintiffs were not the direct victims and that the victim, Tung Hsiao-wu-tzu, was already deceased, therefore, according to the law, the plaintiffs could not file a self-accusation. The four accused detectives were not present. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Kuang-da, stated that the detectives were citizens of the Republic of China and should be summoned by the Chinese court. Since they were not present today, he requested that strict negotiations be conducted to summon them for questioning. During the court questioning, Yang Tung testified that Tung Hsiao-wu-tzu had repeatedly borrowed money from her, and when she refused, he planned</p>
<p>illegal activities.</p>
<p>Tung Shih-kuan and Shih Chang-chin both testified that they were unaware of Tung Hsiao-wu-tzu's arrest and did not lead the arrest. Only Wang Hai-shan testified that the detectives asked him to go with them to identify and arrest Tung Hsiao-wu-tzu and that he knew nothing else. The court ordered the four defendants to be released on bail pending a further hearing at a later date. The plaintiffs' lawyers were also informed that if the detectives had violated the law, they could file a complaint directly with the police station.</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Truck Injures Chinese Child</h3>

Passersby gathered, causing a traffic obstruction for several minutes. The Japanese soldiers picked up the injured child and put him in the truck. A Chinese policeman attempted to impound the truck at the Central Police Station but was unsuccessful. At the same time, a fire department ambulance arrived at the Bund, but the Japanese soldiers refused to hand over the injured child. Later, a foreign police chief, accompanied by a Japanese probationary police chief, arrived at the scene. After a brief conversation, the ambulance transported the injured child to the hospital. It is reported that the child's lower body injuries were not severe.</p>
<h3>Strict Search for Stolen Gold Bars</h3>
<p>The Wang family, residents of Hengmao Lane, Ba Xian Qiao, had 28 gold bars worth over 140,000 yuan stolen from their home. The homeowner reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation. This was reported in the previous newspaper. It has now been learned that the police have identified two pawnshops that purchased the stolen gold bars. They are currently detaining the shop owners or managers to trace the whereabouts of the robbers. Meanwhile, detectives have been strictly ordered to intensify their efforts to investigate and arrest the fleeing gang members.</p>

<h3>Further Arrest in Hsiang Tai Lumber Company Robbery Case</h3>
<p>On November 9th of last year, the Hsiang Tai Lumber Company at number 15, Route Mayen, was broken into and robbed of green aluminum worth over 8,000 yuan.

Arrest warrants were issued for gang members such as Chiang Fu-sheng for interrogation. At 6:15 PM the day before yesterday, the two detectives, Li and Chen, arrested Chiang Fu-sheng (also known as Chang Hsiao-shui or Nitric Acid) at number 44, Lane 66, Xinzha Road. He confessed that the stolen goods were sold to Hsu Chuan-fu, the owner of the Teh Shun Iron Shop at number 177, Lane 725, Yu Qiaqing Road, and police went to arrest Hsu, but he had already fled. Yesterday morning, Chiang was handed over to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Chih-shan requested a postponement.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Regarding the article "Dispute over Water Bills in Cheng Hsing Lane, Route Mayen" in your newspaper on the 20th of this month, which states that several households at numbers 27, 29, and 33 in the lane have had their water cut off, this is entirely incorrect. Upon investigation, although the water supply to the tenants in the above-mentioned houses has been suspended, a tap has been specially installed outside the back door of the house so that they will not be without water. The facts are there for all to see and can be verified. We are writing this special letter to clarify the facts and request a correction. With highest regards,</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>The British Commercial Land Company, Limited</p>

According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, the number of deaths in the previous week totaled 884, breaking the highest death record of the year, with dysentery, typhoid fever, and scarlet fever being the most prevalent. According to news from the city, cholera is also gradually trending, with a mortality rate of about 15%. This shows that the situation is quite serious. Citizens, frightened by the "tiger's" threat, are rushing to buy various effective preventive medicines to prepare for the worst. Among them, Li Chung Sheng Tong's Bao Ji Pills are the most popular. This is because this type of Bao Ji Pill is a well-known and long-established medicine both in China and abroad, with the greatest ability to treat and prevent diseases. It is effective for vomiting, diarrhea, stomachache, epidemic diseases, cholera, various types of dysentery, and other gastrointestinal diseases. Furthermore, the medicine is mild and easy to take.

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Market Shows Peculiar Instability</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: HSBC quotes showed no change. Although the fluctuations in the unofficial British-American exchange market were not significant, the trend felt slightly unstable. From morning until closing, the US dollar was actively traded, with little attention paid to sterling, resulting in a state of weak sterling and tight US dollar. After the morning opening, due to speculators like China Bank tending to sell, positions were abundant, with a slightly firm tone. Later, as the American Bank's appetite remained strong, the noon closing softened. The market sentiment was then influenced by rumors that the British army was withdrawing from Zone B in this city, to be replaced by the American army, or that the International Settlement Volunteers would be stationed there. Therefore, sellers hesitated, and most watched closely. As a result, the US dollar closing price remained at 5.53125 yuan, while sterling was at 3 pence 7.03125, a slight decrease of 0.015625 compared to the previous day, while the US dollar softened by 0.03125. The trend of futures was the same as that of the spot market.</p>
<p>Chinese Merchants Continue to Sell</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London's big orders caused both near and far term to fall by 0.0625. The price of silver at the American Bank remained unchanged. London spot gold remained steady. The exchange rate between sterling and the US dollar remained unchanged, as did the rate against Shanghai. The US dollar was up by one and a half cents against sterling, down by nine cents against Shanghai, and there was no market for the French franc. The central bank's posted rates for various currencies remained the same. At the morning opening, the bank's spot buying price for sterling was 3 pence 6875, and for the US dollar was 5.53125 yuan, compared to the previous day's closing, sterling was unchanged, while the US dollar tightened by 0.03125. After the opening, the American Bank showed some appetite, but Chinese merchants and speculators came to the market to sell, selling 5.50 yuan for September US dollars to the American Bank. Later, in addition to Chinese merchants and speculators continuing to sell, China Bank also sold. The market was slightly firm. Foreign banks absorbed August US dollars from 5.53125 yuan to 5.59375 yuan. The silver balancing tax was announced at 0.25%. After that, the market was calm and showed a hovering state. It is estimated that Japan Bank purchased August US dollars at 5.5625 yuan, and soon sold September US dollars to foreign banks at 5.53125 yuan. After 11 o'clock, Chinese merchants and speculators continued to sell. At that time, Japan Bank absorbed September US dollars at only 5.5625 yuan. The American Bank and foreign banks also made a deal for the same month's US dollars at 5.5625 yuan. However, at the closing, sellers were slightly sluggish, and the price softened. As a result, sterling was at 3 pence 703125, and the US dollar was at 5.53125 yuan, an increase of 0.015625 for sterling compared to the morning opening, while the US dollar remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Market Sentiment Changes Again</p>
<p>The situation in the early afternoon was still calm. It is estimated that Japan Bank sold August US dollars to foreign banks at 5.5625 yuan. However, due to unstable sentiment, due to the rumors that the British army was withdrawing from Zone B in this city and would be replaced by the International Settlement Volunteers, the market slightly tightened again at closing. As a result, sterling was at 3 pence 703125, and the US dollar was at 5.53125 yuan. September sterling was at 3 pence 671875, and the US dollar was at 5.50 yuan, an increase of 0.015625 for both spot and futures prices of US dollars compared to the previous closing, while the US dollar tightened by 0.03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Alone Fluctuates</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 20th (Tuesday) Telegram: The exchange market opened flat this morning, with the US dollar alone showing fluctuations.

Spot Japanese yen also shrunk by 1.5 yuan, to 94.5 yuan. At 9:45 AM, spot Shanghai currency dropped by 1 yuan, to 402 yuan, (yesterday's close was 403 yuan).

<h3>Gold Market Unpredictable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market situation: the market was flat and weak in the noon session, and then became strong in the later session. Market sentiment was difficult to predict, and operators were inconsistent. The stability of prices depended on the hovering of the exchange market. The morning opening was 5,735 yuan. A certain money exchange firm came out and immediately lowered the price, but the firm returned and advanced again. Gold firms also pulled back and rose to 5,745 yuan. Later, because silver firms sold short, both money exchange firms and gold firms sold, lowering the price again to 5,700 yuan. Finally, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was slightly tight, and retail investors bought in. The closing was still 5,740 yuan. The situation in the later market was better. After the opening, securities firms and silver firms all rushed to buy, raising the price from 5,745 yuan to 5,765 yuan. Although another silver firm soon sought to sell, the closing price was quite high. Securities firms purchased heavily, closing at 5,752 yuan. The closing was up 22 yuan compared to the previous day. The trading volume for the whole day was still active, at about 2,000 taels. The price of gold jewelry in gold shops did not move in the end. The price of customs gold remained the same.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rose by More Than 20 Yuan</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, the initial opening price for each bar (10 taels) was flat. Initially, a money exchange firm sold 50 taels from small banks at 5,735 yuan, slightly higher than the previous closing by 5 yuan. Later, money exchange firms and silver firms tried to sell heavily, and the price soon fell by 20 yuan. A silver firm made a deal for 30 taels at 5,715 yuan. Then, because a certain money exchange firm suddenly came to cover short positions, and a certain silver firm was also buying strongly at that time, and gold firms were also buying in, the price was raised by 30 yuan. Gold firms bought 10 taels from silver firms, raising the price to 5,745 yuan. After that, securities firms sold high, and a certain silver firm's overnight long positions were released. In addition, gold firms also turned from buying in to selling out. Soon, the price fell again by 45 yuan. Silver firms sold 50 taels to jewelry shops and other firms at a low price of 5,700 yuan. After that, another silver firm suddenly saw the cheap price and dragged in, and the price rose again. In addition, short sellers rushed to cover their positions. By the noon closing, the price had actually risen to 5,740 yuan. After the closing, the market trend was still strong, and there were still buyers at 5,745 yuan. In the afternoon, gold firms initially made a deal for 10 taels at 5,745 yuan. Then, after a certain silver firm and securities firms rushed to buy in, the price once reached 5,765 yuan. Later, because another silver firm sold short, and gold firms continued to sell out, the price fell back by 25 yuan. Silver firms made a deal for 20 taels at 5,740 yuan. After entering, because securities firms came again to increase their absorption, the price was raised again by 12 yuan. Securities firms bought 10 taels from silver firms, with 5,752 yuan as the closing price. As a result, the closing was up 22 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 65 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold from cash firms was more than ten yuan higher than spot gold. The buy-in price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current margin gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the posted gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>The Price of Gold Jewelry Did Not Move All Day</p>
<p>The exchange price of gold jewelry per tael from gold shops did not move all day. Ta Tung Hang still quoted 590 yuan. The price of new firms was the same as the above price, with the buy-in price reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Notes Rise and Fall Immediately</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation: spot gold fluctuated slightly and rose slightly. The price of sterling and US gold pounds also rose slightly by 0.5 yuan. The supply and demand of sterling notes were even, and the market price stabilized. The price of US dollar notes once rose to 18.1 yuan, but then fell back to 17.93 yuan, still up 0.01 yuan compared to the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong notes was not weak, and the market price rose sharply. There was still a lack of demand for Japanese gold notes and Korean notes, and the market price rose consistently. The former continued to rise to 1.395 yuan, and the latter continued to rise to 1.06 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Returns to 2 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts suddenly returned to rise. In the morning, the buy-in price was 24 yuan per thousand yuan, and the sell-out price was 36 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose again to 37 yuan, and the buy-in price was also 35 yuan, an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate of the money industry association was 0.15 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, an increase of 0.01 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Securities: Unified B Shares Rise the Most, Foreign Stocks Also Rise in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The situation of the unofficial securities market yesterday: initially weak and lifeless, then strong, especially the situation in the afternoon was the best. B shares have broken through the 4 yuan mark, and are on par with quick interest-bearing bank stocks. C shares are approaching 1 yuan, and D shares are approaching the 50 yuan mark, and are about to break through. The general financial community is becoming increasingly excited about buying in. The debt market has recovered, and there is a sign of spring after winter. The so-called thriving situation will soon be realized. The trading volume yesterday was not very exciting in the morning, but the buying interest suddenly increased in the afternoon. Among them, the two firms No. 41 and No. 38 were the most eager to buy. Moreover, these two firms have bought in a lot for many days, and they still have energy to spare, which should not be underestimated. Therefore, multiple parties increased their bets, and short positions were covered, all at once. Such as Yih Tai Lian He's cover, Chang Tai's increase, the market situation is still tight. There are many who should not leave the market, Tong Kang turned to sell out again. Hu Ji Yih Chang Xin Zhi Long Wan sold out. The market atmosphere is still very vigorous, and there is still a good prospect for advancement. The market price results were a consistent increase of 0.1 to 0.45 yuan. Among them, B shares have the strongest upward trend due to their close relationship with dividend rights. The total transaction volume was 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 100 shares of Bank of Communications were traded, at a price of 60.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market at the Public Industry Exchange yesterday opened as bleak as before, but gradually became active. The booming momentum in the afternoon was rarely seen in recent weeks. Reclamation stocks rose first, followed by Jardine Matheson, Shanghai Enterprise, and the Loxing Trust Company, which rose sharply due to its firm stance against the wind. In fact, it was close to the closing, and the momentum was also potential. The rubber companies that had been neglected for a long time were also noticed. The sudden surge was due to rumors that the United States had hopes of joining the European war early to assist Britain, but this may still belong to the realm of speculation.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Telegram 1): Today's Chinese external prices and Far Eastern British merchants' company stock quotes were generally calm. Only the Mercantile Bank shares continued to fall by 3 shillings and 9 pence, at a price of 6 pounds 7 shillings and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Chongsin Yarn Factory Pays Dividends</h3>
<p>The Chongsin Yarn Factory Co., Ltd., managed by the British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd., had a surplus of more than 4.82 million yuan in national currency for the year ending June 1940. The full-year dividend was 7.5 yuan per share for both dividends and bonuses, for a total of 15 yuan in official dividends and bonuses.</p>
<h3>Food: Abundant Foreign Rice Inventory, Those with Goods Eager to Sell</h3>
<p>Although there is still not much fluctuation in foreign rice, there are many changes and instability in between. At the early opening, both buyers and sellers were afraid of the weak momentum of the previous day. Buyers rarely inquired, and sellers, with abundant inventory and new rice about to enter the market, were all eager to sell. Therefore, the early opening prices for each grade all continued to decrease by a small amount of 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. Soon, merchants from the southern gang, rural villages, and the mainland inquired at the low price, and the market price gradually began to rise. However, buyers were mostly speculative, and there was no substantial sales volume. Moreover, few advisors were present at the opening of the first day of rice rationing in this street. In the end, the fixed situation became known. The closing price was still 58 yuan for No. 1 Saigon, 52.5 yuan and 52 yuan for No. 2, 58 yuan and 57.5 yuan for No. 1 withdrawn, 51.5 yuan and 51 yuan for No. 2, 57.2 yuan and 57 yuan for fire-processed, 55 and 56 yuan for Hong Kong pointed, 51.5 yuan and 51 yuan for second grade, 52.5 yuan and 52 yuan for small processed, 47 yuan and 46.5 yuan for Tokyo pointed middle pass, 45 and 46 yuan for rough pointed, 42 and 43 yuan for broken pointed, and 44 and 45 yuan for rice green. No. 2 original package Siamese imported rice initially opened at 61.5 yuan, slightly lower than the previous weekend by 1 yuan. No. 2 Saigon transshipped express fee was 63.2 yuan, and re-exported was 62.5 yuan, also slightly lower by 0.58 yuan. The total transaction volume was less than 300 tons. There are currently more than 5,000 bags of rice, it is said.</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Jiangsu vessel, which carried 9,681 bags of foreign rice from Siam, arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at the company's wharf in Pudong to unload. Also, the company's Taiyuan vessel also arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, carrying 873 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf in the French Concession to unload. The Wah Lun Foreign Company's Heda vessel, which carried more than 16,000 bags from Siam the day before yesterday, has already completed unloading. The vessel is scheduled to leave the port on a certain day and continue to Saigon to transport rice to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Although the source of glutinous rice is lacking, the sales market is also weak. Apart from scattered sales to food vendors, there are few wholesale transactions. Therefore, owners who want to boost sales can only adhere to the original prices. The opening price of Liyang special grade was 61 yuan, Jin Liyang special grade was 60.07 yuan, and Changdan goods were 58 and 59 yuan, 57 yuan, the same as before. As for the usual selling price of foreign glutinous rice, it was originally more expensive than domestic glutinous rice. Later, because the goods arrived continuously and the uses were not as common as local products, it was depreciated again and again, falling directly below domestic glutinous rice. Merchants suffered losses because of this and no longer continued to order. The market goods have also been reduced. The current price of special grade is on par with domestic glutinous rice, but ordinary goods are still inferior. Therefore, the opening price of special Hong Kong glutinous rice was 61 yuan and 60 yuan, ordinary grade was 57 and 58 yuan, second grade was 55 yuan, and Pei Yuan was 52 and 53 yuan.</p>
<p>The rumors of thick and thin japonica rice and other domestic rice, the off-market unofficial market, can be called a situation where supply and demand are similar, and the selling price is the same as before, with no gains or losses.</p>
<p>The source of Zhoupu new japonica rice has become scarce. Yesterday, only 35 loads arrived, so the transaction volume was limited. However, the market color was uniquely firm and tight. The opening price for special grade was 62 yuan, the general market was 61 yuan, and the second-grade crushed and moist rice was only around 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Factory Flour: Large Batch of Futures Opened</h3>
<p>The current flour market situation has turned into a flat and weak situation. The price of No. 2 flour factory's product is still 15 yuan, and the sales channel is still mainly in this street. Fuxin and Fufeng factories both have scattered supply. The quantity approved by the two factories is estimated to be more than 4,000 bags. On the customer sales side, because the transportation of Chinese factory flour is inconvenient, the demand for Japanese flour is still good. Four thousand bags of Green Phoenix brand October futures were opened at a price of 14.923 yuan. This month's was 14.8 yuan, and the current flour was also opened at 500 bags, at a price of 14.6 yuan. Because there are still many who sell the returned goods, the market is particularly soft. Both domestic and foreign flour have weak inflows and outflows, and there is little change.</p>
<p>The wheat market situation continues to be stable. Recently, the sources in Hongkou and Zhabei have slightly increased, and the inventory of each warehouse is also quite large. The sellers are unwilling to let go easily due to the high production price. The Japanese factories do not offer more than 21 yuan, so although there are more than 3,000 bags of released factory goods, they are still being discussed in terms of evaluation. The Chinese factories still only receive sporadic small tickets, and the selling price varies. The market is currently in a dilemma between rising and falling.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: New Jiujiang Soybeans Enter the Market, Price Opens at 31 Yuan</h3>
<p>Various miscellaneous grains from Jiujiang are mostly transferred from Anqing. Therefore, this year's new Jiujiang soybeans from Jiujiang Chenmen are still transferred from Anqing to Shanghai. The transactions in the market are still referred to as new Anqing soybeans. The first batch of 80 bags arrived yesterday, and the goods were satisfactory. They were distributed by the retail industry in Mujie, at a price of 31 yuan. The source of old soybeans has been received, and people's hearts are slack. The transaction volume has decreased. The market price is high and fixed, and the second grade is soft. Three hundred bags of soybeans were transacted at a price of 35 yuan to 35.2 yuan. Two hundred bags of Qingdao soybeans were transacted at a price of 34 yuan. One hundred and fifty bags of Chongming soybeans were transacted at a price of 30.01 yuan. Also, one hundred bags of sand yellow were transacted at a price of 29.5 yuan. Five hundred bags of Pudong Dudu soybeans were transacted at a price of 33 yuan to 33.7 yuan. Apart from Qingdao soybeans being handled by the Nanyang Gang, the rest are for this street, it is said.</p>
<p>Today, there are 1,290 bags of soybeans being transported to Hong Kong. Also, yesterday, 1,200 bags of raw peanuts came from Yantai.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Overproduction, Yarn Market Falls Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which was trending upward the previous day, turned downward again yesterday. This is because actual transactions are weak and people's hearts are ordinary. Therefore, although many parties are optimistic and pulling in, the environment does not allow it. The fundamental problem is that production increases while consumption decreases, so the foundation cannot be consolidated. The current situation is still in a hovering and brewing stage.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the current yarn market was still enthusiastic. Continuing the good momentum of the previous day, the bulls pulled up strongly. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 925 yuan, rising to 930 yuan. As soon as this price opened, buyers on the platform were not strong. At the same time, spot sales were mediocre, and the momentum turned downward again. The general hat-snatching people saw the wind and turned the rudder, and they all sold out. In this way, the chips loosened, and the market price fell step by step to 909 yuan. The closing was slightly higher. The statistics of transactions in half a day show that 1,095 bags were transacted. The market price was down 10 yuan except for 10-count double. Today, 140 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same Trade 1,600 Hong Kong 485</p>
<p>Xiamen 10 Statistics 2,095</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Bleak</h3>
<p>The situation of current cotton is still as bleak as ever. Factory purchases are very stagnant, so there is no major inflow or outflow in the market. The price of Indian cotton is 219 yuan. 300 pieces were transacted by the same trade. The price of fire engine cotton at the warehouse is 160 yuan. 180 bags were transacted by the same trade at the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Red Sugar Firm</h3>
<p>Dutch sugar has shown an upward trend for two days, and Dutch red sugar has risen more strongly due to the lack of goods and strong sales. However, the price of Taikoo white sugar for which a low price was fixed before will soon arrive in Shanghai, so the market price has softened. Yesterday's association's price division, spot price 24 coarse white, was 73 yuan for the local warehouse, 72.6 to 72.8 yuan for the foreign warehouse, 72.2 yuan for old goods, and 57.5 yuan for transit goods, an increase of about 1 yuan compared to before (18th). Dutch cotton white was level and fixed, TML mark 70, KD mark 7! Because the inventory is gradually tightening, the initial price was 60.7 to 61 yuan, and later it was raised to 61.8 to 62 yuan, an increase of about 2 yuan. Taikoo White Sugar B Mark was 74.8 yuan, DY Mark was 70 yuan, HX Mark was 69.5 yuan, down 0.2 to 0.5 yuan, H Mark military red was 60 yuan, up 1.5 yuan, the local factory's plan white was 71.5 yuan, and the local ice remained unchanged. Domestic sugar Dongxiang red and white packaged good goods opened at 54 yuan, and oil-packaged was 52.5 yuan, both up 1.5 yuan, for a total transaction of 500 bags. The Hong Kong gang opened 200 bags of Binghua Qing, still at 73 yuan. It is found that 70 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong yesterday.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Ball Factory Price Reduced, 6.8 Yuan Per Load</h3>
<p>The price of coal balls has decreased these days because the foreign exchange rate has eased. The factory prices of the same industry should be reduced accordingly. The association decided yesterday that the Yitai and Nanyang Guohua coal balls would be 124 yuan per ton for the same industry's own vehicle warehouse, and additional vehicle force would be added for delivery. The price for the gate village in this street is 6.8 yuan per load, a decrease of 6 yuan per ton compared to the previous week.</p>
<h3>Seafood Dried Fish</h3>
<p>Yantai dried fish, long out of stock, has recently arrived. Upon arrival, it was promptly warehoused. The goods appear quite dry. Yesterday, sales began, with a batch priced at two hundred and five yuan.</p>
<p>The Chicago dispatch of the 19th reports: The wheat market is experiencing slight declines due to Northwest selling pressure. Factory and outside interest is minimal, and many are selling off excess holdings.</p>

<h3>Excerpts from Provincial Examination Topics</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Provincial Examination Topics: (First Topic) Zi Hua was sent to Qi, and Ran Zi requested millet for his mother. Confucius said, "Give her a dou." He requested more, and Confucius said, "Give her a hu." Ran Zi gave her five bin of millet. Confucius said, "When Chi went to Qi, he rode fat horses and wore light furs. I have heard it said that a gentleman helps the needy but does not add to the rich." (Second Topic) Rewarding officials for their duties is how to encourage senior ministers; rewarding loyalty and trustworthiness with generous stipends is how to encourage scholars; and using light taxation at the right time is how to encourage the common people. (Third Topic) Fu Yue was promoted from between the rammed earth walls, Jiao Ge was promoted from among the fish and salt, Guan Yiwu was promoted from among the officers, Sun Shuao was promoted from the sea, and Baili Xi was promoted from the marketplace. (Poetry Topic)</p>
<p>Compose a poem on the topic of "Bamboo Shoots Filling the Mountains, Phoenix Tails Aligned," with the rhyme character being "Qi," eight rhymes in five-character lines. (Book of Changes) To use cloth as a cauldron. (Book of Documents) Clearly evaluate based on merit, and use carriages and clothing based on accomplishments. (Book of Odes) Presenting the bamboo containers and dishes, enjoying the wine to the full. With brothers all present, harmony and affection prevail. (Spring and Autumn Annals) In winter, Shan Bo met with Marquis of Qi, Duke of Song, Marquis of Wei, and Count of Zheng in You. Hunan Provincial Examination Topics: (First Topic) Confucius said, "To know it is not as good as to love it, and to love it is not as good as to delight in it." Confucius said, "Those above average can be spoken to about higher matters; those below average cannot be understood with higher matters." (Second Topic) If rulers and ministers, fathers and sons, and brothers abandon personal gain and embrace benevolence and righteousness in their interactions, there has never been a case where they did not become kings.</p>

<h3>After Reading a Letter from "A Certain Dancer"</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>We received a letter from someone calling themselves "A Certain Dancer from a Dancing Hall." The writing is very immature, and there are many confusing parts, but her (let's assume she's a dancer) main point can still be discerned from this short letter.</p>
<p>Her meaning is: Recently, the patrons of various dance halls can be divided into two main categories: one is "people who have made a fortune from speculation and have nowhere to spend their money"; the other is "people who wear sharp suits but run away after dancing." The "hope" expressed in her letter is: They are forced to be dancers by life, so they naturally hope that rich people will come to their rescue, but throwing money around without any concern seems to make them feel guilty (and they naturally dare not even think about other intentions), so they hope that these "people who have nowhere to spend their money" will set aside half to do other charitable works. As for those "young men" who "dance for free," they also hope that they will work hard in their studies and not waste their time in the dance halls.</p>
<p>It is impossible to know whether this letter was truly written by a dancer, but judging from the writing, the person who wrote this letter is at least related to the dance hall, or lives by the dance hall (such as dancers, servants, etc.), and is a thoughtful person. At the very end of the letter is "I am someone who has not received a proper education," and her pain is even more evident in her words.</p>
<p>To prove the abnormal development of the "isolated island," the world of pleasure is naturally the best mirror. They disregard the lives of the masses and desperately create rumors and stir up trouble in the market, just to fill their own pockets and seek their own enjoyment. The mention of "charitable work" is truly, as the Shanghai vernacular says, "just talk." However, ill-gotten gains will be ill-spent, and their lavish spending at least alleviates the suffering of a few people (dancers). Of course, if they harbor other bad intentions, this is something that the sisters of the dancing world should be wary of themselves.</p>
<p>As for those sharp-suited "free-dancing" people, apart from what is said in the letter, "it is truly too abominable," I feel it is even more "truly too regrettable"!</p>
<p>Finally, according to yesterday's news: The statistics for the number of dancers in the city's dance halls in July decreased by 30,000 compared to June. This is the most powerful warning: it indirectly illustrates the unreliability of speculation; those who "dance for free" may even be like "dogs that have lost their homes."</p>

<h3>"Counter Monkey"</h3>
<p>— Chen Guozai</p>
<p>"Counter Monkey" is my nickname. I've been a "Counter Monkey" for about four or five years now. In these four or five years, my accomplishments are only learning to smoke water pipes and doze off. Nothing else. What I got was the honor of being called a "Counter Monkey." Every day, from eight in the morning to nine in the evening, except for meal times, there is no rest. A full twelve hours is our working time. Throughout the year, except for a few major festivals, there are no weekends or holidays. All day long, all year round, we are always standing at the counter, sleeping; sleeping, standing at the counter. Our work is very monotonous, and our life is very dull, without waves or changes. Every day is like this, every year is like this. I eat Southern Goods rice. I started as a trainee "Counter Monkey," but not an apprentice. I just wasn't qualified to be a formal "Counter Monkey" yet. At that time, I learned how to wrap triangular packages, how to use scales, how to check banknotes, and how to help greet customers. The rest of the time I spent standing in the shop, gazing idly at the street, and judging the women who walked past the shop, which one was good, which one was not. Actually, none of this had anything to do with us. Sometimes, I would also meddle in other people's business, acting as a peacemaker. Time flew by quickly, and I went from being a trainee to a formal "Counter Monkey." At that time, I not only learned how to use scales, pack parcels, check banknotes, and greet customers, but I also learned cunning tricks and ways to deceive customers. For example, even if something weighed only fourteen taels, we had ways to make the scale show a catty and two taels. At the same time, I became even more skilled at judging women and meddling in other people's business. When there was nothing to do, I would smoke my water pipe and specialize in judging people. Our work is very simple: welcoming and seeing off, greeting customers, and nothing else. But even if business is very slow, we cannot leave the counter for a single step. No wonder people call us "Counter Monkeys." Because the work is easy, it has formed a habit of standing by idly and being slow to act. In the past, our older predecessors often encouraged us to learn this half-dead attitude, and even called it "self-cultivation." Learning this skill could prolong life. Indeed, from my experience, this half-dead attitude cannot directly prolong life, but it can indirectly prolong life. If you don't believe me, just look at everyone who stands at the counter, they rarely get angry. If you are anxious and angry with them, they will smile at you, and at most slowly reply with a "Coming!" With such a skillful attitude, how can it not prolong life? Speaking of our treatment, it is really very meager. Our annual income is not even as much as a trainee's monthly salary at a bank. The "gentlemen's" salary was originally four silver dollars, and the apprentices' was two thousand copper coins. So you may ask, how do we make a living and support our families? Sir, please don't worry, listen to me slowly. The shop provides us with food and lodging. The four dollars is our actual pocket money. Of course, it is impossible to support a family with these four dollars. However, every "Counter Monkey" has a family, and their families have never starved to death. What method do they rely on? I can tell you: in old-fashioned shops, the staff standing at the counter do not rely on the small monthly salary, but on the year-end bonus. At the end of the year, we can get a bonus that is dozens or even hundreds of times our monthly salary. Therefore, usually, our income can only support ourselves, while the year-end bonus is the only source of support for our families. Therefore, although the income of a "Counter Monkey" is small, they can still struggle through the years. Among the employees of general old-fashioned stores, "Monkeys" are still good positions.</p>
<h3>Thoughts, Sights, and Sounds</h3>
<p>— Qian Fei</p>
<p>Another incident of a tram conductor's negligence causing a passenger to die unjustly happened the other day. The conductor on the tram seems to think he owns the tram, doing whatever he wants, starting whenever he wants, treating human lives like child's play. This common bad habit should really be stopped. On the one hand, passengers themselves must also be careful. If they encounter this kind of "impatient" conductor and can't get on the tram in time, they can wait for the next one, to avoid accidents.</p>

<p>The Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Dancing Queen's Lodging</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 5: Bad News</p>
<p>There were a few people talking in front of the telephone booth. Thinking about it now, it was indeed a bit strange. But there was no injured person on the ground. Who hit him? Since Ni Jinshou already knew the news, why did he come to ask me instead? That's too contradictory! This sudden dramatic change in the case not only surprised me but also made me lose my ability to cope.</p>
<p>"Oh no! Is Mr. Hawthorne in danger? Mr. Bao, you have to think of a way."</p>
<p>I admitted that I really had no way at this time and couldn't answer, so I just shook my head at Shi Gui. I remembered something Jin Sang often said: "Panic doesn't solve problems, it only increases the degree of danger and leads you further astray." I thought to myself, "That's right, I have to calm down and find a way out." I took out a cigarette, sat on the sofa, slowly struck a match, and lit the cigarette. But Shi Gui was still staring blankly in front of me.</p>
<p>I comforted him again, "Shi Gui, you don't need to be like this. I believe that with Mr. Hawthorne's wit, even if something unexpected happens, there won't be any serious danger. You go outside, maybe Detective Ni will arrive soon. When he comes, we will naturally have a way to proceed."</p>
<p>I wasn't just comforting Shi Gui with empty words, I really had sincere faith. The formidable enemies Hawthorne encountered, like Mao Shizi and Jiangnan Yan, were too numerous to count for a time; he tasted quite a few bullets, and I could find several scars on my body too. So I believed that he definitely wouldn't be in mortal danger.</p>
<p>After Ni Jinshou hung up the phone, it only took him six or seven minutes to get to Avennue Road. In those six or seven minutes, the amount of brain cells I used must have been astonishing. But my conclusion was still optimistic. After I sent Shi Gui out, my cigarette wasn't even finished, and the sound of a car stopping at the door could already be heard. I quickly threw away the cigarette butt and stood up. Ni Jinshou walked in hurriedly, and Shi Gui followed behind him. I saw that Ni Jinshou looked very nervous, his eyes darting around the office, as if he was still hoping that Hawthorne had already returned.</p>
<p>He asked, "Still no news?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. "Not yet. Sit down, don't panic, what exactly happened? I still don't know." (82)</p>

<h3>US Rushes to Build Airplanes: Film Companies Greatly Affected</h3>
<p>— Shu Mang</p>
<p>Technical Problems Occur in Sound Recording: All Studios Move to Underground Work</p>
<p>All the major film companies in Hollywood have recently been rushing to build underground studios, moving all their filming work to the basement. The reason for this is that, amid the recent global turmoil, American aircraft factories are working day and night to rush out large numbers of airplanes. And after each aircraft is manufactured, it must undergo a low-altitude test flight nearby to check whether all parts of the aircraft are completely flawless. There are many American aircraft factories in Los Angeles, which is very close to Hollywood. According to a recent survey by the US Department of Commerce, each aircraft factory can produce an average of one aircraft every forty minutes. And after each aircraft is manufactured, it must undergo a low-altitude test flight nearby. As a result, the skies over Hollywood have been filled with a constant rumbling sound, deafening. These loud engine noises have a negative impact on the sound recording work of film companies, and this kind of noise is the fatal flaw of sound films. When this phenomenon first occurred, the film companies tried various technical prevention methods, but all were ineffective. They also released orange-yellow balloons into the sky above the film companies to warn those airplanes not to fly near the area, so as not to disrupt the filming work of the film companies. At that time, all the film companies in the suburbs of Hollywood adopted this warning method. As a result, the sky in the "studio area" was full of clusters of orange balloons, which was quite a sight to behold. This signal is naturally known at a glance to general professional aviation personnel, and they will no longer fly close to that area. However, some amateur aviators have not yet understood the meaning of these orange balloons. When they saw them in the sky, they thought they were for sightseeing. Even those who were originally far away scrambled to fly closer to watch. As a result, it attracted even more noise. Therefore, in order to avoid these airplane noises once and for all, the film companies have successively built underground studios with extremely complete equipment. These underground studios, in addition to having all the equipment of ordinary studios, also have very effective soundproofing and air defense equipment. In case of emergency, when something happens in the country, they can still carry out film production work underground as usual, without being at a loss and being forced to stop as they were during the First World War.</p>
<h3>New Creations in Domestic Films</h3>
<p>— Leng Bai</p>
<p>Adopting the Double Sound Recording Method</p>
<p>If it is said that movies can control the emotions of viewers, then I believe that the background sound is the most effective in promoting the effect. The reason why European and American films are praised is not only because of their great backgrounds and superb acting skills, but also because they can be equipped with beautiful music in terms of sound effects. It often makes people feel very comfortable when they listen to it, so someone said: Music can comfort the spirit. This is not an exaggeration. Foreign films rely on the progress of science and technology and can also configure music in dialogues. This double sound recording method is called Dubbing. However, Dubbing in domestic films has never been adopted except for separate sound recording due to the backwardness of machinery.</p>
<p>Recently, the reporter learned from the Guolian Film Company that the double sound recording method will also be adopted in the future in films such as "Xi Shi" and "Su Wu Herding Sheep." On the screen, you can hear both dialogue and music at the same time, which is the Dubbing mentioned above.</p>
<p>According to them: This Dubbing first collects the dialogue, and then opens it in the recording studio for simultaneous music recording; in this way, it can be transmitted to the audience's eardrums together on the screen, which can be comparable to European and American films. Of course, the cost of this machine is quite high, and the size must be accurately measured when recording, otherwise it will be too much or not enough.</p>
<h3>Impressions of "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night"</h3>
<p>— Tao</p>
<p>Originally, there are only more unhappy people in the world! A talented composer sold his beautiful and immortal songs for only fifteen dollars. Although he was successful and wealthy for a time, he was soon abandoned by the public due to his bad luck, and eventually spent his life in poverty, drinking all day long, and eventually dying of sorrow. This is the life of the American musician Stephen Foster, and it is also the general plot of "Spring River in the Flower Moon Night"!</p>
<p>But Stephen is dead! His beautiful songs are forever hummed in the mouths of everyone in the world, he is immortal after all! The interludes in the film include six songs such as "Oh! Susanna" and "Jeannie with the Light Brown Hair". Among them, "Old Black Joe", which was requested by Stephen's old servant "Old Joe" before his death, and his last work "The Old Folks at Home" are the most beautiful.</p>
<p>The artistic achievement of this film is only average. The musical atmosphere is quite strong. Compared with "The Great Waltz", the difference is still far away. However, director Sidney Lanfield's skills are not weak either. He handles this film without any redundant scenes, allowing the plot to develop smoothly, and several climaxes are also very powerful, which is not a failure. In short, the best scenes in terms of atmosphere are two: one is when Stephen sits and listens to the blacks singing and making music while working, coupled with the scenery of nature, which makes people yearn for it. The other is when Stephen's "The Old Folks at Home" was composed but not yet publicly sung, he suddenly had a relapse of heart disease due to excessive drinking, and died in poverty. Therefore, Al Jolson told the audience that Stephen had passed away, and sang his last work, and then ordered the audience to stand up and sing along with him. At that time, the sad and emotional atmosphere made people recall Stephen's previous frustration, and even the audience under the screen could not help but shed tears for it!</p>
<p>The whole film is dyed with five colors, and the picture is very beautiful. Among the actors, Don Ameche's performance as Stephen Foster has reached perfection, Andrea Leeds's Jeanie is only average, Al Jolson's singing is not very popular among Chinese people, but his acting skills are extremely mature. All in all, this is not a film that cannot be watched.</p>

<h3>A Scene from Guohua's New Film "Romantic Emperor" Jin Cheng Ying</h3>
<h3>A Record of Kun Dan Tong Zhiling</h3>
<p>— Qi Cheng</p>
<p>Kun Dan Tong Zhiling is meeting Shanghai people for the first time. Tong is originally from Jiangnan and lives in Tianjin with her father, who is in the education field. Zhiling and her brother Shouling have loved Peking opera since childhood. When they are free from studying, they like to study it. After graduating from middle school, they hired a teacher to teach them. Later, they joined Huai Sheng's school, and because of their intelligence, they learned its essence. In 1928, she performed for the first time at the Tianjin New Central Theatre. Most of those who supported her were from the education and art circles. At that time, the genuine famous Qingyi Huashan, Xin Yanqin, who was praised by the people of Tianjin as the Golden Throat Song Queen, was on the same stage. She learned a lot from studying hard day and night. Later, the new actor stopped performing, and Tong took the lead role. Her brother Shouling played the role of Xiaosheng to accompany her. Zhiling's signature plays are Feng Huan Chao, Xiang Luo Dai, Bi Yu Zan, and Fang Mian Hua. It is said that the play Fang Mian Hua caused a sensation among the people of Tianjin and Tanggu. Her performance is better than Liang Xiaoluan, who performed in Shanghai last time, and can be compared to Wu Suqiu. Zhiling's appearance is beautiful, but her facial expressions are too stiff, and her singing voice is sweet. This time, she went south with Sheng Zaonan, which can be said to be a perfect match.</p>
