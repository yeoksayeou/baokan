<h3 id="c4">德義在地中海與遠東 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>據傳說：義大利首相墨索里尼氏定於今日在那不勒斯演說時，宣述義國對於歐洲戰局之態度。溯自德國進攻波蘭之後，義國自始把握二點，一希望交戰國和解，二義國暫不參戰；二者含義極動彈微妙，九月來之義國即以此自持。但戰事範圍既延之挪威，義國國內不但反英袒德之音調日趨激越，即各種備戰舉措與社會運動亦顯示英義對立之日趨尖銳，參戰機運遂有岌岌不可終日之觀。是以及今日而謂義相行將宣述義國對歐戰之態度者，他無態度，殆無異謂將以今日宣戰。今日何日？一九一五年五月二十四日，義國與英法簽訂秘密協定，於是而先後與奧德交戰，今日其二十五年後之紀念日也。</p>
<p>又據傳說：德國擬在遠東採取一種巧妙而冐險之行動，即擬向日本商借所佔據之中國海南島，資爲潛艇在遠東對央法作戰之根據地。瓊崖者中國唯一之大島，港　如犬牙，位於英屬香港與法屬越南之間而得左右控制之：其沿海若十要港，茲陷於日人之手。</p>
<p>右傳說，二主體與內容逈殊，洵爲截然二事，所可得而相提　論者，歐戰是否竟將延擴及於地中海以至於遠東？站於遠東而諦視之，究應如何感應？</p>
<p>近人有若干理論，論據完整，儼然形成其爲顚撲不破之原則；如謂世界和平與安全小可分，近人所暢論之一端，至可服膺者也。例以九一八日本對中國發動武力侵略之後；因英國西門之流不能體認世界和平與安全之不可分，於是世界大局經九年之漸次惡化而至今茲，英倫逐遭八百餘年來所未嘗有之威脅；個中綫索，前後途徑，乃爲事實與趨勢極合情理之發展，最足說明不可分原則之精采。於此論之，義大利之未能始終置身事外而必參戰，歐洲戰爭與速東戰爭之未能各自千秋而必化合，乃爲事屬當然而不過時間問題，幾類註定之宿命矣。雖然，時間空間固輒以其罅隙予人類以良好之機會，而人類智慧　應能存亡續絕於和平安全未亡未絕之頃。尤如所傳義國首相今日所將宣述者，至少在今日尚有盤旋餘地；義相固得使義國暫時繼續維持其與歐戰之隔離，而非必今日宣戰。蓋　義國方面言之：誠有其近乎忍無可忍之感情與意念；然對於德國、或猶有其尚　千妥萬當之成議：對於央法，則不但外交途徑初未遮斷，即謂談判門戶尚未暢闢，亦無不可。即就義國所謂自然願望而論，義國朝野固再三表示之以各種不同之方式，然迄猶保留其正式而公開之最嚴重方式。然則今日預言今日宣戰，雖有可能，雖有跡象，不豈過早？不豈過甚？至於義大利對英法與德國之間，應如何左右袒，事惟義人抉擇之；然義大利在今日應如何使歐戰範圍暫不延及地中海，亦即地中海之和平與安全應如何暫予保全之於火焰之中，則惟義人主宰之，亦爲世人所殷望於義人；此其利害與後果極深遠，不惟站於遠東者如此觀感已也。又如所傳德國擬借海南島，倘所傳有據而竟演爲事實，則其表面爲英法遭受襲擊之又一慕，其形態爲國際烽火之又一起，其問題爲遠東紛爭之又一環，而其事實之性質則爲德日結成與國而歐戰範圍遠及此一隅，乃與遠東戰爭趨而合流。難然，我人不但因站於遠東，爲遠東利害計而希望事不至此，爲德國戰時與戰後計而希望德國無此擬議，更以常識衡之：甚可斷言於所傳之根本無稽。此無他，日本對德國倘供給以任何軍事據點，即爲日本對德國與英法之間之態度確定：要知日本確定其態度，初不以日本與英法之邦交與利害爲判斷，亦不以德日之邦交與利害爲基礎，而惟視日本對美國之膽量與力量爲轉移；日本方陷於中國泥淖，根本不足以言對美之膽力也。故日本方面無其事。德國抱負雄心，切齒英法；然在彼目前所努力之事軍策略上，貴平集中全部力量，以期一舉而予英法以致命之打擊，而英法所資於海外者，甚多甚大，香港越南其小焉者，詎在德國現階段之目標之中。在彼戰後所理想之國際政策上，一要獨力支配之資源，二要自由發展之市塲，故與中國多溝通之道，而與日本成牴牾之局；彼嘗示好日本者，既由於戰前外交縱橫椑闔所需，亦期以戰時或能共同赴敵，及至今茲，事勢全非。故德國方面無其事。據此種種，可知世界全局，倘若放任之於相激相盪而不已，則因世界和平與安全之不可分，雖波及大西洋太平洋之彼岸可也，奚止地中海與遠東：倘若各方善用智慧，則於此歐戰尚　延及地中海之時，共謀縮短歐戰時間，於此遠東戰事尚未與歐戰化合之時，共鎩侵略之羽，則世界和平與安全之光復，固不必俟世界共遭浩刧之後也。</p>

<p>莫斯科　英蘇貿易初步談判之進行及性質、國外報紙所載、類多傳聞失實、關於此點、塔斯社頃由官方授權聲明如左、</p>
<p>（一）一九三九年秋間、英外相哈里法克斯向慈聯駐英大使邁斯基表示、英政府願與蘇政府開始談判貿易協定、蘇聯政府在答復中表示、在原則上同意進行此項貿易談判、但在另一方面、英政府採取各種步驟减少並限制對蘇貿易、例如取消蘇聯同英購買工業品之訂貨單、扣留運往蘇聯之船隻及貨物、在蘇芬戰事進行時、英對蘇採取仇視政策、開除蘇聯在國聯之資格、英國主持其事、凡此種種、均不能使該項談判順利進行、</p>
<p>（二）蘇芬和約簽訂後、英外次白特勒復於一九四〇年三月十八日、代表英政府向邁斯基建議重開貿易談判、邁氏於同月廿七日答復哈里法克斯、表示如英政府確有誠意解決英蘇貿易問題、並在談判未開始前、釋放被英當局扣留之蘇輪「薩倫格」及「邁亞柯夫斯基」號、則蘇聯政府可同意重開該項談判、四月十九日、哈里法克斯復以英政府復文交邁斯基、在該復文中、英政府表示願意明瞭蘇聯政府對貿易協定之確切建講、同時並要求蘇聯保證所有輸人貨品祇可供本身之消耗、而不得暫運德國、此外、英政府並將蘇英貿易協定與限制蘇聯對德貿易混爲一談、四月廿九日、邁斯基以蘇聯政府之復文交哈里法克斯、其內容要點如左，</p>
<p>（甲）蘇聯係一中立國家、無論對中立國交戰國均已與之通商並將繼續通商、此項貿易之進行、係依據蘇聯本身到於進出口貨物之需要而定、</p>
<p>（乙）蘇聯與德國訂有貿易協定、蘇聯對於該項協定業憶履行、並將繼續予以尊視、蘇聯認為在與第三國進行談判中、絕不能以德蘇協定爲談判之主題、同時、蘇聯亦不欲以英國與他國簽訂之貿易協定作爲此次兩國談判之主題、</p>
<p>（丙）蘇聯政府願在互惠原則下、與英國恢復貿易關係、但此種貿易協定之締結、絕不能違反雙方與其他各國之貿易義務、蘇聯與英方談判貿易協定時、確係準備目英運入貨物、作爲己用、並無將該項輸入品轉運德國之意、</p>
<p>（丁）蘇英貿易協定談判之最佳先決條件、爲釋放被英當局扣留之蘇輪「薩倫格」及「邁亞柯夫斯基」號、</p>
<p>（三）五月八日哈里法克斯以備忘錄致邁斯基、對四月廿九日蘇政府之復文、表示意見、在該項備忘錄中、英政府並無確切之建　、竟提出關於德蘇貿易關係之新問題如下、德蘇貿易協定之內容、蘇貨運德之數量及條件、限制蘇聯戰爭原料運往德國、及統制假道蘇聯運往德國之貨物之可能性、蘇聯自英輸入貨品之用途及蘇聯在德國之市塲等等、關於蘇輪兩艘被扣留事（該輪所載貨品係運往蘇聯）、英政府並未作確切答復、祗稱該輪已移交法政府、並建議蘇政府對違禁品統制問題成立協定、在備忘錄中、哈里法克斯並鄭重聲述英政府擬使英蘇貿易關係順從英國作戰目標、</p>
<p>（四）五月廿日蘇聯人民外委會委長莫洛托夫、對哈里法克斯五月八日之備忘錄以復文致央方、在此復文中、蘇聯政府鄭重聲明、蘇聯決不能使其貿易政策順從任何國家之戰爭目標、蘇聯係一有主權之國家、絕對可以在互惠及平等原則下與中立國或交戰國進行貿易、五月八日哈里法克斯在其備忘錄中所提出關於德。蘇貿易之新問題、絕非蘇聯政府權力所可答復、且亦不能成爲兩國貿易談判之主題、</p>
<p>關於自英運入之貨品、蘇聯政府已於四月廿九聲明、此項貨品係供蘇聯本身用途、而絕未轉運德國、至於蘇聯兩輪被扣後、英方所作之解釋、並未使蘇聯信服、蘇聯政府認爲、英政府對此舉應負全責、蘇聯政府認爲、英政府提出蘇方能力所不能爲之問題、證明英方確無與蘇聯進行貿易談判之誠意、（二十一日塔斯社電）</p>

<p>對英貿易頗為密切</p>
<p>在和平時期、南美最表示歡迎者、即對英貿易、英國曾向南美採購其所需物品百分之六十、且希望對南美情形、加以改善、是以南美與英國之貿易關係、頗為密切、蓋英國頗需要南美供給各種原料、而南美則需要英國供給各種機器也、</p>
<p>德發言人昨日表示</p>
<p>德駐華大使館發言人昨日在招待新聞記者報道席上、除申述歐洲最近戰況外、並對最近報紙所傳德機轟炸艱民婦孺事、有所解釋、其言頗為幽默、據該發言人稱、「德　於轟炸對方鐵路公路交通綫時、在路上逃艱之婦孺、其中少數人被波及、自屬難免、但決無如協約國方面所傳難民被炸死傷之衆、」該發言人又謂、「德方曾通告對方人民、於德軍到達時、可仍居於家中、不必逃避」云云、其言詞之間、似竟責反當地人民逃難為多此一舉、而被德機轟炸時之不幸遭波及」、係屬「咎由自取」、</p>

<p>大陸報云、工部局正努力取締商人違法牟利、將於下星期初、對貨物未標價格之攤販二十人、提出公訴、據平價委員會某委員聲稱、工部局此舉乃對非法抬高食品與貨物價格者、採取更有力行動之開端、日後凡店主拒不標明貨價者、亦將訴諸法院、工部局對該二十攤販、曾一再警告、各該攤販置若罔聞、故決訴諸於法、當此所以未曾出此者、因須予商人以充分時間、籌備標價等手續、且使其明瞭工部局言出必行故也、</p>
<p>物價規定</p>
<p>法租界公董局雖尙未向任何商人提出公訴、但工部局此舉、乃與公董局合作、故料法租界方面即將有同樣行動、同時、工部局檢查員賡續視察界內各市塲與商店是否遵照局方所定出售食物之規例、惟工部局迄未規定物價、故對同一物品、標價各別問題、尚未有所舉動、蓋顧客見甲店標價、廉於乙店、自必在甲店採購、乃可促使乙店减價、法幣滙值、近告回漲、本市食物價格、昨日乃有下跌趨勢、如外僑日常食品牛油與酒類售價、物已回跌、</p>

<p>法租界平準委員會、於昨日下午四時、在霞飛路法公董局開會、到中法各委員十餘人、對於華人日用品米煤及西僑日用品如麵包肉類等之品質及價格、討論頗詳、聞以後法公董局對於日用貧之品質重量、是否與價格相稱、將予嚴密注意、如有朦混取巧、即予處罰、至於西報載平準委員會將設立公寓特別委員會、處理房租糾紛及取締挖頂費說、因問題複雜、且華人案件、向由法阮處理、外人之租賃糾紛案件、則由法領館辦理、昨日並未提出此項之討論、</p>
<p>麵包太貴</p>
<p>又據外人方面消息、法租界平價會昨日下午舉行會議、席間各委員以麵包價格、目前已售至每磅五角、似太昂貴、故議決特約一麵包商、專事焙製價格駁低之新式麵包、規定其價格為三角五分、以供本埠駐軍之用、至於設立「外商市塲」一案、聞該會已展期實行、惟在「外商市塲」成立前、將對各商店所出售之日用品、就其質量價格、作一嚴格之檢舉、務使物價不致過高影響平民生計、</p>

<p>皇內參觀者談話和步履的聲息，交織一起，在輕暖柔和的空氣中，浮動着。一顆顆的心，似乎浸沉在芬芳馥郁的花液裏面，不期然的叫人陶醉了。</p>
<p>昨天已經是會期結束之日，而參觀者還狠多。室內的兩個角落，滿滿厚厚地佈成花山，標着「工部局出品」，花團錦簇，萬紫千紅，這是花的集體表演，可謂以「量」多勝。</p>
<p>這一部份包括着山梗菜屬，蔊菜屬，實艾答里撕屬，鄒菊，和常年性的菊花等：有許多專名詞，在外行人看來，好像拿着醫生的方子，很難懂得。</p>
<p>榮膺二次總錦標，彼德葛蘭爵士大銀杯的紫羅蘭菴周氏出品——同事周瘦鵑君的精心之作，最能引起參觀者的注意。</p>
<p>周氏出品都是玲瓏小巧而十分精緻的；正中桌上，中央供着「蕉卜達摩」，巨型的巴蕉，收縮到盆中，的是奇觀；下面一盆為「款乃歸舟」；淺盆中佈置着山石，石罅中長着短樹，旁邊一叢碧綠的小草，彷彿蘆葦。一葉扁舟，放於中流，非常可愛。</p>
<p>右面桌上標着「八珍」——代表八　瓶盆的村料——計：王，石，磁，銅，磚，砂，竹，木。裏面所植的為懷子連，山石，月月紅，金銀花，何郎花，米葉冬青，竹，和三色堇。</p>
<p>左首所陳列的小品，在什錦架上安放著許多小玩意兒，裏面有高二寸半的小楓樹盆景，小草，榆，金茉莉，雀舌松，柏，米葉冬青，和海棠等。這些小植物都種植在特選的瓶盆中，在古氣盎然之中，表現了種植對的一番技巧。</p>
<p>此外還有靈芝形的小榆樹，半　　　的紅十姊妹，自薔薇，和金茉莉；石上的爬山虎，銀杏，松鹿，柳穿魚——花如小紫藤，有香。</p>
<p>位置在中央面俯臨一切的為古鼎中的一棵金銀花，搖曳生姿，別有風格。參觀者對於周氏出品無不欣賞備至。</p>
<p>其他尚有孔志清的盆景盆載；各種瓶插花，桌上飾花，和園藝出品等。除了孔氏為國人外，其他都為西人出品。幼童部份出品，有許多為學校方面的學生，最年幼的在八齡以下。他們的陳列貧當然比較的簡單而樸質多了。（E．L．)</p>

<p>七百元、不翼而飛、當時周並未報告捕房、但仙樂舞宮之舞票聞五元以上其式樣類似鈔幣、其票面亦標明幾元字樣、該竊賊當時認爲法幣、乃併予偷取、及後發覺係屬舞票、未能兌現、故於前日將舞票五百餘元附於信中寄還、但信中除聲明誤竊舞票、深表歉意外、並着周梅君</p>
<p>掉換現款</p>
<p>二百元、仍置原信中、放於樓下扶梯　、當來携取、否則生命小心等語、周乃報告靜安寺捕房、派探陸運賣梁俊山前往周庽守候、一面着周仍將舞票一束、上覆一元法幣一紙、置於信中、放在梯畔、至前晚七時餘、有揚州人張展財王月連二人到來拾取信封、</p>
<p>被探拘獲</p>
<p>帶人捕房、査得張係該公庽一樓一號房間音樂師斐列賓人所雇女傭之子、飭令牧押、昨晨解送特一院刑二庭、捕房律師張天蔭陳述案情、請求覊押、又據周梅君投訴一切詰之張王二人、供詞支吾、庭諭押候改期七天再訊、</p>

<p>在昔我國貨幣種類單純、唯銀與錢二種、自錢歸官鑄之後、莠民爲牟利起見、竟私自收買大錢、改鑄小錢、政府因此輩奸徒蠢國病民、嚴令禁止、犯者處以極刑、逮至淸末、銅元誕生、一枚可作制錢十文或二十文、苟將大小制錢改鑄銅元、獲利更厚、此種執法之舉、當時民間爲者尚鮮、多由割據之軍閥、公然</p>
<p>設廠鼓鑄</p>
<p>故自入民國以還、銅元充斥市場、川湘武漢等地尤夥、每一銀幣之兌換率、最低時降至三百數十枚、八一三事變前一年、國府實行改革幣制、並因貨幣種類逐漸增多、爲制止奸民僞造損毀等情起見、特頒幣制暫行條例、以補現行刑法內所定罪刑之小足、馴至抗戰軍興歐戰繼起、五金價値高漲無度、遂又與奸徒一大</p>
<p>發國難財</p>
<p>之絕好機會、四向牧羅、當十當廿之銅元、私自設爐鎔銅出賣、以致無論舊式銅元或分幣銅元、皆已絕跡、市塲目前此物市價、據各銅錫店所收、每一法幣由八十枚至五十五枚不等、其一般專收銅元鎔銅之徒、因滬市已無大宗可得、竟有轉向叫鄉及京滬滬杭兩綫與長江一帶各淪陷區搜羅者、據悉內地雖仍不少行使銅元之處、然亦以日方</p>
<p>購求殷切</p>
<p>價已抬高、惟苟能設法一運滬、猶可獲倍蓰之利、顧彼專一營此業之徒、亦知國法嚴厲、迄尚係秘密鎔化、故警務機關縱有風聞、從未破獲、迨至前日、新閘捕房幹探始偵知梅白克路五百七十九弄十七號趙鴻興翻砂廠內、設置爐鍋、鎔化銅元、立即向第一特區地方法院檢舉、山院簽發搜索票、馳入該廠細予</p>
<p>搜索之下</p>
<p>當於　隅發現鍋爐器具及鎔成之銅塊、爐畔更置碎銅銅元、即由探　而貯之、另有未鎔銅元二千五百枚、則藏床底、亦被搜出、探員乃將廠主鄂人趙厚祿·僱工江北人仇扣子、一併逮捕、昨晨連同證物解送第一特院、工部局代理律師張天蔭依據幣制暫行條例第二條、對趙仇提起公訴、審判長以此案關係重要、而該犯等貌似</p>
<p>無知愚氓</p>
<p>除為指定律師出庭辯護外、更諭以新舊法律關於私鎔國寶處刑嚴重之原因、令即據實供招幹此違法勾當究歷若干時日、獲利幾何、詎趙竟一味唯唯諾諾、祇求寬恕、經反覆盤詰、始供鎔已六星期、每一法幣所買之銅元、鎔化銅塊後、可售一元八角、嗣質之仇扣子、則供鎔化工作、另有藝徒協助廠主為之、渠不參預、庭上</p>

<h3 id="c80">外幣軋漲 <a href="#c80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>昨日外幣以金價終於軋泓、故英美金鎊需要略增、價漲一元、英金票以平準會在黑市扒吸英匯仍勁、故亦趨漲一元、美金票始做十七元七角、後開平準會父來扒吸外滙、因而曾抬至十八元二角、午後又退爲十七元八角半、但比上日終漲一角半、秀港票隨港滬滙兌軋漲五分、此外如法郞·安南·菲列濱票等均有需要、市價一致趨漲、日金票始則供給頗旺、市價趣下、午後突有需要、市價回平、晚市仍爲一元零八分、朝鮮票供求仍勻、晚市仍爲九角二分、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市況、復趨上游、觀日來之變動、猶似拉鋸戰爭、漲跌互見、此以歐洲局勢之發展難斷、匯市緊鬆頻報、而多空實力平均、故市面甫力即回、回後復升、本日晨開買氣頗濃、開盤即好四十元、爲五十八百元、旋因錢兌業證券帮等莫不在進、雖銀號帮居間力塞、終以外滙吿緊、買方氣魄較高、五千九百四十元高價、未幾即見、嗣聞滙市轉鬆、銀號錢兌業相繼賣出、跌達五千八百十五元、午刻港帮突又購入、曾再漲至五千八百七十元、午收則爲八百五十五元、後市初景仍佳、後散戶當日多頭急急了結、　面出多進少、價遂抑低、結果五半八百二十五元收盤、較上日軋漲六十五元、全天交易平淡、約二千數百兩、銀樓飾金結果好起十元、海關金等仍平、自晨每條（十兩）、初開人。緊張、一開即抬四十元、銀號進金號十兩、爲五千八百元、隔手某錢兌　進銀樓帮十兩、爲五千八百五十元、但斯時雖證券帮與某錢兌業繼續吸收、而賣者尙有銀號帮及金號吐出不少、故當時市勢稍定、奈不久外滙突吿走緊、買風漸强、而售者四散、價再飛漲百元光景、證券帮進銀號三十兩、爲五千九百四十元、此後滙市忽報回硬、買風頓挫、某錢兌業反進爲塞、金號及銀號帮亦來沽出、遂回落一百二十五元、金號出銀樓十兩、爲五千八百十五元、旋證券帮重來扒吸、且某銀號亦乘低補空、加之港帮從中活動、復又步漲五十五元、金號進銀號二十兩、爲五千八百七十元、午刻買風漸散、某銀號及散戶沽出、重見回小、銀樓帮進金號二十兩、爲五千八百五十五元作午收價、午後開時堅挺、抬起十五元、首由金號進錢兌業十兩、爲五千八百七十元、但開後某金號苜來寨出、銀號亦跟之拋售、市勢轉向下步、退至五千八百五十元、後加某銀樓亦代客多頭出籠，　以散戶午前浮多見量脫手、而塲中買者甚缺、再吿步落三十元、銀號對做三十兩、爲五千八百二十元、繼而金號進錢兌業十兩、爲五千八百二十五元作晚收價、結果比上日軋漲六十五元、全犬一百四十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、牧進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金好起十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百丸十元、迨至九時三十分掛大十元、未逾一圳鐘冉高十元、十時十分回落十元、收後無變化、結果大同行改懸六百元、新同行與上價相同、收進的减低三十元光景、</p>

<p>證券暗盤昨日市況、交易非常淸閑、市况乃至爲一安定、竟與外匯金子等處於同一樣的靜止狀况中、儼然萬木無一聲待雨來、沉悶局面、全日未有一展開、外匯與金子猶可說咸在企待義國之表明態度、公債與此初無關係、竟亦趨於停頓、全日交易、以午後之淸淡爲尤甚、集會不足一刻鐘、即已散會、市價升沉、亦極微細、而久未做開之九六公債、忽有一二萬成交、由四元八角升至五元、市價結果、高低互見一二角左右、九六與四月九日行市比較、略小一角半、成交總數約計四十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>衆業股市、歐洲傳來消息復甚紛歧、戰事結果、猶在未定之天、但綜觀局勢、似已多少改進、股市欲其在此番大跌風中轉向、無疑需要更多含有決定性的策勵因素、昨日交易不寂、價格亦微有進步、設以各公司之獲利能力加以度量、目下各收股價格之低於其本身應値水準、似覺太過、但此點非眼前一般人所樂於研究者、蒼吾人之整個文明基礎、頃正橫遭摧殘也、</p>
<p>英聯股復最普及、成交五萬三千五白股、其趨勢亦最似浮萍之不定、商價二十六元半、低價二十一元半、收盤二十五元有買戶、怡和股需求亦　、見三十一元半低價後、回復至三十四一元半收盤、國際揚子上海墾殖鋼業亦俱甚邀買戶靑睞、價格則低廉猶昔、會德豐股始時形勢甚惡、後來逐步改進、收盤五十六元買進、六十元賣出、（老股）橡皮股趨勢仍軟、</p>

<p>紗市平疲、但　需雖無大量需要、然香港方面、零星採辦、尙屬不惡、所以人氣尙安定、惟海外棉業狀况、仍在衰頽之境、因之有一部份逢高時、仍來套賣不絕耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、人氣和平、所有各方面的材料、亦無利多、加之印棉跌風尤熾、塲中買戶雖喊高、然接受者寥寥無幾、二十支雙馬價爲一千三百二十五元、旋聞外匯仍鬆、又復回挫至一千二百八十元、卒以廣帮銷路尙堪支持、又見回高一步、查半日間成交統計一千三百七十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌十八元、今日有棉紗、二千七百西十件運香港、一千二百九十件運廣州灣三十五件運海口、一百二十件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>米市昨日晨開見疲、因賣買雙方休於市勢之難以捉摸、不敢貿然出手、無論實銷、及心思交易、旣鮮問題、懷貨者反將獲利貨略事鬆脫、故各貨曾貶二三角、若小紋　四十六元七角、二號暹邊四十六元半、不過霎即受市上謠傳、謂歐戰嚴重、對於產地洋米出境、將施統制、並聞黃金外滙平穩、致使人心復堅、大都反出爲進、內地如寗紹等幫客戶、搜羅尤亟、對於價格最廉之二號暹米、暢納不衰、計辦去五六千包、全日總計乃成交萬包以上、行情早市開價後拾級上升、小絞自四十六元七角開價大至四十八元午收、下午又自四十八元三角開價至四十八元六角收盤、比之前晚四十七元收價則漲有一元六角、其他各洋米均較大一元至元半不等、</p>
<p>糯米到貨雖續有千餘包、但因季節關係、需求殊切、故售價步升元許、金溧特元已開四十五元至四十四元半、常丹白元四十三元零、中次四十一元、江北貨亦售四十一元至四十元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳到源繼續不斷、日來塲外暗盤、因一般高貨、乘意扳抬、昂貴特甚、辦貨者亦感難於下手、故市况寥落、未有榮無辱、無錫眞特淸粳仍爲五十一二元、粉粳五十元左右、其他各貨、均屬相仿、</p>

<h3 id="c96">響應「日光節約」運動 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 直之</p>
<p>最近本市工部局發起的「日光節約」運動，將於六月－日起見諸實行了。遣是值得提倡的，更為今日孤島市民們所當一致響應而確切自我實行的一個有意義的運動！</p>
<p>我們知道，在經過了「八一在」砲火以後的上海，一切情形都表現得太反常了，試看生息在這樣環境裏的各級人們，也都缺乏良好的指導和改進，他們的行動，便表顯了畸形的反響；諸如夜間狂歡於歌榭舞台之中，日上三竿猶鼾睡等許多不合情理的舉止，這在大的方面講，是减退了人們工作的效率；從小的方面看，也是妨碍了個人一已的身心健康，同時也增重了生活高潮下另－支出的負擔。</p>
<p>所以，對於工部局目下提倡即將實行的「日光節約」運動聲裏，全市同胞們，無論為了私人着想，公眾着想，均有一致響應而提倡而實行的必要，先從改良自己的身心習慣上着手，養成早起早眠的良好習慣，在下午提早結束了工作以後，藉此做些戶內運動，出外散散步，以求恢復整天疲乏了的身心，同時更得多些時間讀讀書，看看報，以及其他有益的消遺等，希望大家有決心而誠意的澈底把牠實行罷！</p>
<h3 id="c97">閃電化與牛步化 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>

<h3 id="c98">最後警告 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 鑒天</p>
<p>把外匯當作「擋箭牌」的商人，這次總算赤裸裸地將他們醜惡的面目呈現在每個市民的面前，無所遁形，不過吃慣子田螺的鴨子，它還有最後的本領，—躱到棚裏去來俶聲不響，亦即俗語所謂「悶聲大發財」是也。外匯放長祇做不見，漲了價的不肯减，你又如之何？</p>
<p>以這副「硬幹」手段來對付全市市民，自然綽乎有餘，因為市民除了呼號，憤怒之外，祇有望着它躱在棚裏細細咀嚼田螺餘味的得意樣子，對於自己的癟肚子皮是無補的。可是旣失去了「擋箭牌」的藉口，也終究有「依法辦理」的一天，工部局決於下週中對投機米商二十人提起公訴，那決不是鬧着玩兒的。</p>
<p>在過去，當局曾承認對於抑平價的工作，表示失敗，那就因為「擋箭牌」高懸在前，他們裝足了「將本求利」的正當商人，旣不能透過箭牌看清楚他們的本來面目，而反在要求「保護」之例，所以當局一再聲明，要求市民協助，如發現故意抬高價格等情，立即報告，以便澈查，—這就是個別擊破「擋箭牌」的一種消極的辦法。有人以為這是當局的敷衍塞責，我以為這是應該原諒辦事者的苦衷的；現在奸商露出了本來面目，當局不就立即嚴懲嗎？</p>
<p>不過照情形看來，對於抱「悶聲大發財」主義者，懲一或不足以儆百，全體市民應該乘這時機，共同協助，不論一角一分之微，如有發現故意抬高價格者，立即告發，在當局的決心實行法律制裁的時候，使那些吃慣了田累的鴨子，不及靜待消化，而噎塞而死，那才大快人心。</p>
<p>最後，向打破了「擋箭牌」的鴨子們作最後的警告，現在應該考慮一下怎樣應付你們末日到來的「善策」了。</p>
<h3 id="c99">小學敎科書果然縮小版本 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 納遜</p>
<p>據我的一個在某大文化機關里服務的朋友對我說，因為原料的漲價，他們公司里預備把小學校敎科書縮小版本，他正在担任這一部工作。</p>
<p>他們不單是縮小，而且還重新在剪貼，把揷圖剪去了，把每一行，每一排統統排得緊緊的不留空地，天地頭也縮短了許多；但是，据預算或恐還須漲點價。</p>
<p>這，在書賈一方面，當然是可以有理由伸述的，他們可以說為了减轻學生家長們的負担。</p>
<p>但是，在學生方面是加重了負担了：因為揷圖不僅是可以引起讀者興趣，而且，還可以按圖索驥，養成觀察能力和加强推理作用，至於行列排得稀，是可以减省目力，使學生不會感覺沉悶，枯燥，祇有天地頭似乎沒有什麼大用處，有之，也不過是「美與不美」罷了，現在是被一視同仁地處理了</p>
<p>我覺得，在現在全國各學校無力購置儀器和實物敎具時，敎科書不僅不應减少揷圖，而且應該增添，或許是他們同業公會已經大家商量好了才做的，他們當然也有着他們的苦衰。不過，我還希望他們能注意到敎育方面的效率。</p>
<p>我希望大家嚴重地注意起來，無論如何，小學敎科書不能這麼做，但僅僅是縮小一倒不妨；而且，我還希望別再加價！</p>

<p>第廿四回　湖山蕩滌各有千秋　士女歡騰共呼萬歲</p>
<p>未愛人想：這件事，非得與金澹雲商量，請她帮忙一下不可。最好到了雙十節那一天，仍請原班的人，到自由村來熱鬧一天。她想出個法子來了：蘇理雅太太在自由村圖書館捐了這許多的錢，我們到了那天，便請她來揭幕。這事要得金澹　預選給她說去，不然，到了國慶那一天，蘇理雅太太宴會很忙的。到鄉下一走，倒可以謝絕各處宴會了。其次，便是何家兩位小姐的廠址是已定了，房子而且急於要建築了，圖樣已在林建成工程師的設計中了。我們託澹雲姊夫催一催，這個廠房圖樣，在幾天內趕成功了。我們一面再與何家姊妹商量，就在雙十節那一天，在自由村的廠址上，行奠基禮，這不是很好嗎？行奠基禮的那一天，我們更可以邀集許多姊妹都到，而且老　醫師，我也要請她到自由村來咧。朱愛人這一番計畫，無非要博老祖父的歡心，先與金澹雲商量了，金澹雲滿口答應，說是建成的圖樣，不成問，我可以督促他。而且建築公司也現成，近來房子，因為材料齊備，造起來也快。不過蘇理雅太太，不知道那天預先有約沒有？倘然沒有別約，我可以陪了她來。至於我呢，向來逢着國慶那一天，我是大忙特忙，因為要招待外賓的。今年恰巧在告假期中，我是一定可以來的。朱愛人想：林工程師來了，蘇理雅太太來了，也不怕你不來。這樣的說定下來，到了雙十節那一天，有許多姊妹，都可以來了。那一天，在自由村吃過夜飯以後，他們仍舊把朱愛人送到安樂鎭醫院上，然後這輛家庭施行車，回到上海，其時也不過夜間十一點鐘。何家兩位小姐因為開辦織綢廠，有種種籌辦的事。為了經濟以及設備上事，要與江鏡蓉接洽。為了圖樣以及建築上事，要與林建成接洽。所以她們在上海，也有至少兩星期的耽擱。在上海也不寂寞，也有許多姊妹，而且金澹雲她們還預備第二次的試車。這第二次的試車，原是預備在星期六的，并且想去約了吳君素同去的。不想大氣不佳，下起雨來，這雨還是他們從自由村回來的半夜裏，就下起來，一直到了星期六，還沒有停。　（二八五）</p>

<h3 id="c101">行都的劇潮（上） <a href="#c101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>

<p>重慶的戲劇節</p>
<p>（重慶通訊）今年，重慶的四月，不單是婦女的月份（因爲四月裏來渝的有三夫人，二女王，八女參政員（全體），反侵略作家史沫特萊—等），而且由於重慶舞台的劇潮汹湧，也可說是戲劇的月份。有四個」重頭戲在四月裏出演在重慶的舞台，它們喚起了廣大觀衆的熱烈反映。更値得注意的，內中有二個劇本又作了一番招待來渝貴賓的隆重禮物，因而又充實了叫月—戲劇節—的內容，使它們更活躍，更具有特殊的意義。</p>
<p>國立戲劇學校的旅渝公演，是這次劇潮的推動者，他們共帶來了三部「重頭戲」，替四月的行都增光不少，這也是値得一提的。</p>
<p>茲將這叫個劇本，逐一依據演出的先後，向孤島劇迷諸君報吿：</p>
<h3 id="c102">第一聲的「岳飛」 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>國立戲劇學校在重慶舞台上演出的第一聲，是古裝的歷史劇「岳飛」，這是一個四幕劇，編劇者爲顧一樵，導演楊村彬，自四月一日至四月五日晨，在國泰大戲院演出，共演九塲。</p>
<p>「岳飛」的演出，一般的講，雖不可過譽它的成功，但也不算失敗。劇本內容方面，還不够積極，稍與現實脫節，這是不可否認，不過在尾聲裏，給編者强調了一下，全劇比較上是减去了不少漏洞。在演出者方面，各演員都是相當賣力的，而且技術也不差。「岳飛」是一個重頭戲，在道方面不努力，則「岳飛」的演出是極危險的，然而事實說明了觀後的觀衆，對它却非常滿意，四天內塲塲客塲。</p>
<p>這時，恰巧美，英，法，蘇四國大使均會集行都，機會難得，於是國民外交協會負起了它的敦睦邦交之使命，利用古裝的「岳飛」，在四月五日晨的最後一塲，包盡會塲座位，完成了招待四大使和宣傳國有精神的二大任務，當時，四大使夫婦和在渝各外賓都欣然出席，即國府要人中，如孫科馮玉祥邵力子孔祥熙等也參加，人數超過了預定，有許多貴賓太太之流，竟然也站觀終塲。這一天，開麥拉更大見活躍，將許多貴重的鏡頭都留下了永久的紀念。</p>
<p>最後，大家愉快地，在「滿江紅」的雄聲中，歡然而歸。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Northern Hubei Chinese Army Counterattacks Again: 50,000 Japanese Soldiers Encircled; Large Numbers of Chinese Troops Arrive at the Front from Laohekou; Most of the Remaining Japanese Forces at Huyang and Huhe Eliminated <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman told reporters this afternoon that Japan, confused by the precedents in Europe, is actually attempting an Asian-style blitzkrieg strategy in Central China. Japanese forces, blinded by their desire for victory, have ignored the fact that the situation in Europe and China have several drastically different elements. The vastness of the Central China front, the difficulty of transportation, the rugged terrain, and the harsh climate, all contribute to the failure of Japan's efforts. The spokesman did not shy away from the intensity of the Japanese offensive in recent days, admitting that Yanyang was recaptured by the Chinese army on May 16th, only to be seized by the Japanese army three days later. It is said that yesterday morning, the Japanese vanguard had already reached the vicinity of Fancheng and Xiangyang, which are the main objectives of the Japanese offensive. Xiangyang has been under heavy Japanese artillery bombardment, but the Chinese army began a counteroffensive again yesterday afternoon, and a large number of reinforcements advanced from Laohekou, repelling the Japanese forces and relieving the danger to the Tang and Bai Rivers and Xiangfan. The current Japanese line stretches from Taipingcheng on the right to Longshan Temple on the left. The Chinese army has once again encircled the Japanese forces in the Zhaoyang area, estimating that no less than 50,000 people are trapped within the Chinese army's encirclement. Among them, 30,000 were dispatched during the first offensive, and 20,000 were reinforcements brought in last week. The Japanese side used more mechanized units this time than in any previous battle, with at least two mechanized regiments participating, each requiring more than 3,000 trucks to support their numerous tanks. In addition, there were also many heavy artillery pieces and aircraft. In this battle, the Chinese army has captured or destroyed more than 4,000 trucks. This seems to be a serious tactical error on the part of the Japanese army. Japan's strategy is good, but the tactics it employs are very poor. The current situation has put the Japanese army in a very dangerous situation. The majority of Japan's armed forces are trying to rescue troops that cannot retreat. The spokesman concluded by saying that the Chinese army is confident that it can completely annihilate the Japanese army in Zhaoyang within a few days. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Madame Chiang Song Meiling, Director of the National Women's Comfort Association, noted that Japanese planes have recently repeatedly attempted to raid the capital, and it is thanks to the heroic Chinese air force soldiers who bravely defend the airspace and deliver a head-on blow to the Japanese. She especially instructed the association to unite with the New Life Movement Association and the Lichi Society to organize a comfort delegation, carrying a large number of comfort items, to visit the air force at a certain location on the morning of the 22nd. Tang Guozhen and Huang Renlin delivered speeches on behalf of the delegation, and the air force soldiers replied that they vowed to defend the airspace with their hot blood. (Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Laohekou: The remaining Japanese forces south of Huyang Town and Huhe Town (both northeast of Zhaoyang) have been encircled and annihilated by the Chinese army, and most have been eliminated. Shuanghe Town and Xindian (both northeast of Zhaoyang) have been recaptured. On the morning of the 21st, more than 5,000 Japanese infantry and cavalry soldiers and more than 20 tanks were added from the Lutou Town area, launching a fierce counterattack. The Chinese army met them head-on with a strong formation, fighting fiercely until nightfall, killing countless Japanese soldiers. The battle is still raging. (Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Fancheng: After the Chinese army successively recaptured Zhaoyang and Tuqiaopu (southwest of Zhaoyang), on the morning of the 21st, more than 4,000 Japanese soldiers and fifty or sixty tanks launched a large-scale counterattack against the Chinese army from the southeast. The Chinese army displayed thunderous momentum, launching a fierce counterattack, and the repeated charges and killings were extremely fierce. Fighting continued until nightfall, killing more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers. Another unit of the Chinese army launched a fierce attack on the flanks and rear of the Japanese army from a certain location, and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with more than 2,000 Japanese reinforcements near Jiefanggang. (Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Luoyang: More than 2,000 Japanese soldiers who had infiltrated Xinqiangpu (south of Xinye) were encircled and fiercely attacked by the Chinese army, and most of them were annihilated. On the night of the 22nd, the remaining Japanese soldiers crossed the river and fled eastward, and the Chinese army is pursuing them. (Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Luoyang: After the Chinese army in southern Henan recaptured Xinyang on the 18th, they searched for the remaining Japanese soldiers on one hand, and set fire to the Japanese gasoline warehouses, etc., on the other, causing heavy losses to the Japanese. For days, large numbers of Japanese planes flew to the city and bombed it extensively. The Japanese launched an even more fierce counterattack, and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. (Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Today, a Chinese military spokesman said that the large-scale Japanese offensive in northern Hubei was tense again yesterday, and Zhaoyang was occupied again, and Xiangyang and Fancheng were subjected to fierce bombardment. Although Japanese planes launched a large-scale attack, the Chinese army in the upper reaches of the Han River also launched a fierce counterattack, and finally drove the Japanese army in Fancheng to Zhaoyang. The Japanese army in Zhaoyang, totaling more than 50,000 people, has now been surrounded by the Chinese army. The Chinese army is currently adopting a "flexible tactic" in northern Hubei, retreating step by step in the face of the Japanese army's frontal attack, and quickly encircling the attacking Japanese army, and then attacking them from all sides. (United Press dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese military dispatch received here early this morning, the war in central Hubei has suddenly become fierce again. The Japanese army, which was driven out of Zhaoyang by the Chinese army last week, has received reinforcements of 10,000 men from the Japanese army in Hankou and launched a counterattack on the 17th. The fighting is currently extremely fierce. (Reuters dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Nanyang: After the Chinese army recaptured Changtaiguan, a remnant of the Japanese army was trapped in Zhuying, Liuzhuang and other places, and defended the stronghold to the death. The Chinese army besieged them for days, killing many Japanese soldiers. Around the evening of the 20th, the Chinese artillery launched a fierce bombardment, and the infantry bravely charged and killed, breaking through several layers of Japanese barbed wire and entering the Japanese阵地. The fighting continued until midnight, and all of the more than 300 Japanese soldiers were wiped out. All of these places have been recaptured, and many spoils have been seized. There is currently no trace of the Japanese army near Changtaiguan. (Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Xiangyang: After the Chinese army recaptured Dian, Taiping Town, and Liujiazhai (all north of Zhaoyang) on the 22nd, they launched a fierce attack on the remaining Japanese forces near Zhaoyang, and the progress was very smooth. At dawn on the 21st, five or six thousand Japanese infantry and cavalry soldiers and more than fifty tanks launched a counterattack on Taiping Town and Liujiazhai in separate routes. The Chinese army used clever tactics to detour around the sides of the Japanese army in separate routes, and by noon, the encirclement had been formed. The fighting was fierce until nightfall, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. The remaining Japanese soldiers failed to break through, and are currently being fiercely annihilated. (Dispatch on the 23rd)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The Japanese army in northern Hubei has been gathering remnants from all sides for days, making a last-ditch effort. Since the 19th, they have been using a large number of planes and tanks as cover to break through to the north. One part of the Japanese army engaged in another bloody battle with the Chinese army north of Zhaoyang, and another part reached the banks of the Bai River. The Chinese army blocked them in separate routes, and the Japanese army's momentum was greatly thwarted. In addition, the Chinese artillery provided support from across the river, and its power was even greater. The Japanese army is already in a dilemma, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them. (Dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The war on the border between Henan and Hubei is still in full swing.

<h3 id="e4">Germany and Italy in the Mediterranean and the Far East <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>According to reports, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to deliver a speech in Naples today, stating Italy's attitude towards the European war situation. Since Germany's invasion of Poland, Italy has adhered to two points from the beginning: first, hoping for reconciliation between the warring countries, and second, Italy will not participate in the war for the time being. The meaning of these two points is extremely subtle and dynamic. Italy has been maintaining this position since September. However, as the scope of the war has extended to Norway, not only has the tone of anti-British and pro-German sentiment in Italy become increasingly fierce, but also various war preparations and social movements have shown the increasingly sharp antagonism between Britain and Italy. The opportunity to participate in the war is therefore seen as being in imminent danger of collapse. Therefore, today's statement that the Italian Prime Minister is about to state Italy's attitude towards the European war is, in fact, no attitude at all, and is almost equivalent to saying that war will be declared today. What day is today? May 24, 1915, Italy signed a secret agreement with Britain and France, and then successively fought against Austria and Germany. Today is the 25th anniversary of that day.</p>
<p>According to another report, Germany intends to take a clever but risky action in the Far East, that is, to borrow Hainan Island from Japan, which it occupies in China, as a base for submarines to fight against Britain and France in the Far East. Qiongya is China's only large island, with harbors like dog teeth, located between British Hong Kong and French Vietnam and able to control them from left to right. Its coastline has ten important ports, now fallen into the hands of the Japanese.</p>
<p>The above reports, the two subjects and contents are vastly different, and are indeed two separate things. What can be discussed together is whether the European war will eventually extend to the Mediterranean and even the Far East? Standing in the Far East and examining it, how should we respond?</p>
<p>Some modern theories, with complete arguments, seem to have formed an unbreakable principle: that world peace and security cannot be divided. This is one of the most convincing points made by modern thinkers. For example, after Japan launched a military invasion of China on September 18, because British Simons and others could not recognize that world peace and security cannot be divided, the world situation gradually deteriorated over nine years to this day, and Britain has suffered a threat that it has not experienced in more than 800 years. The connections, the past routes, are extremely reasonable developments of facts and trends, which best illustrate the essence of the principle of indivisibility. From this point of view, Italy's inability to stay out of the war and its inevitable participation, and the inability of the European war and the Far Eastern war to maintain their independence and their inevitable merging, are all matters of course, but only a matter of time, almost a kind of destined fate. However, time and space often give humanity good opportunities through their gaps, and human wisdom should be able to preserve and continue life while peace and security have not perished. Just as what is said that the Italian Prime Minister will state today, there is at least room for maneuvering today. The Italian Prime Minister can indeed enable Italy to continue to maintain its isolation from the European war for the time being, rather than necessarily declare war today. Generally speaking, Italy does have emotions and ideas that are close to being unbearable; however, regarding Germany, there may still be agreements that are a thousand times better; regarding Britain and France, not only has the diplomatic route not been cut off, but it cannot be said that the door for negotiation has not been opened. Even in terms of Italy's so-called natural desires, the Italian government and people have repeatedly expressed them in various different ways, but they still retain their formal and public most serious way. Then, to predict today's declaration of war today, although possible, although there are signs, isn't it too early? Isn't it too much? As for how Italy should side with Britain and France or Germany, the matter is for the Italians to choose; however, how Italy should prevent the scope of the European war from temporarily extending to the Mediterranean today, that is, how the peace and security of the Mediterranean should be temporarily preserved in the flames, is also up to the Italians to decide, and is also what the world hopes from the Italians. The benefits and consequences of this are extremely far-reaching, and it is not only those standing in the Far East who have such feelings. Also, such as the report that Germany intends to borrow Hainan Island, if the report is true and actually becomes a reality, then its surface is another suffering of attacks by Britain and France, its form is another rise of international flames of war, its problem is another link in the Far Eastern disputes, and the nature of its facts is that Germany and Japan form an allied country and the scope of the European war extends to this corner, and merges with the Far Eastern war. It is difficult to be sure, but we not only stand in the Far East, and hope that things do not come to this for the sake of the interests of the Far East, and hope that Germany does not have this intention for the sake of Germany during and after the war, but also measure it with common sense: it can be asserted that the report is fundamentally unfounded. This is nothing else, if Japan provides Germany with any military bases, it will be that Japan's attitude towards Germany and Britain and France is determined: it must be known that Japan's determination of its attitude is initially not judged by the friendship and interests between Japan and Britain and France, nor is it based on the friendship and interests between Germany and Japan, but only depends on Japan's courage and strength towards the United States; Japan is stuck in the quagmire of China, and it is fundamentally insufficient to talk about courage towards the United States. Therefore, the Japanese side has no such thing. Germany has great ambitions and gnashing its teeth at Britain and France; however, in the things that it is currently striving for in military strategy, it is important to concentrate all its strength, in order to give Britain and France a fatal blow in one fell swoop, and Britain and France rely on overseas sources, which are very many and very large, Hong Kong and Vietnam are small, which are not in Germany's current stage of goals. In the international policy that it idealizes after the war, one is the resources that it can dominate independently, and the other is the market for free development, so there are many ways to communicate with China, and there is a conflicting situation with Japan; it once showed goodwill to Japan, both because it was needed before the war for diplomatic maneuvers, and also hoped that it could go to the enemy together during the war, and now, the situation is completely different. Therefore, the German side has no such thing. According to this kind of thing, it can be known that the global situation, if it is allowed to be stimulated and shaken without end, then because the world's peace and security cannot be divided, even if it affects the other side of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, why only the Mediterranean and the Far East: if all parties make good use of their wisdom, then when this European war has not yet extended to the Mediterranean, they will jointly seek to shorten the time of the European war, and when this Far Eastern war has not yet merged with the European war, they will jointly cut off the wings of aggression, then the restoration of world peace and security does not necessarily have to wait until the world has suffered a great catastrophe.</p>

(3) Runcheng Town, an important stronghold east of Yangcheng, has been captured by the Chinese army in one fell swoop with swift action, and they are continuing to attack Yangcheng. (4) The war around Yangcheng is becoming increasingly fierce.

<p>Tokyo: Since Abe arrived in Nanjing, negotiations on the issue of adjusting relations between China and Japan have not yet begun. Newspapers here have been criticizing one after another recently. "Asahi Shimbun" stated that Japan's policy of quickly resolving the "China Incident" should be implemented more vigorously after the establishment of the Wang Jingwei regime, but there has been no major progress so far, and the reasons for this are still unknown. The European war has now expanded, and it is very dangerous for the Japanese authorities to only see its benefits and not its drawbacks. No matter how the European war turns out, the Japanese government must do its best to seize the opportunity to resolve the China Incident as much as possible, otherwise, it may be too late. "Kyoto Shimbun" also stated that it is still unknown what kind of activities special envoy Abe is currently carrying out in Nanjing. It is rumored that he will go to North China and Mongolia, but this is probably not credible. In short, the official negotiations have not yet begun, which is not in Japan's interest after all. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun published an article arguing that Japan must end the "China Incident" as soon as possible and occupy a solid position in the European war.

If the European war continues to proceed at the dizzying speed it is today, Japan will soon not be able to fill the gaps with elderly generals, as France is doing today.

<p>Tokyo: The Ministry of Justice convened a meeting of judges and prosecutors from across the country on the 19th. Minister of Justice Hisada Kimura delivered a speech, advocating clearing up heretical doctrines that harm the country and society and safeguarding true Japanese thought. He said, "Drastic changes have occurred in the domestic situation. Since the government has tightened restrictions on the economy, the general public has felt pain. Therefore, some people have been seduced by foreign organizations, and cannot avoid going astray, attempting to disturb the thoughts of the people in the rear. However, the people in the rear should have sound thoughts during wartime. All of you are judges and bear even greater responsibilities. The urgent task is to eliminate communism and ideas that harm the country and society, and to prevent the staff of various radical groups from having room to operate. In short, I firmly believe that the Japanese people will be able to overcome various difficulties and will not be seduced by such heresies." (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Tokyo – General Kobayashi, the Governor-General of Taiwan, arrived here the day before yesterday and gave a speech to the press, stating, "I have served as Governor-General for four years. Rumors of my impending resignation are only natural. If a suitable candidate is found, I intend to retire, but this is not under consideration at the moment. As for Taiwan's position, it has undergone significant changes since the outbreak of the 'China Incident.' Taiwan is the core of our country's southern expansion, and it is essential to develop southern China and the South Seas in the future. However, Japan is currently constrained by the Chinese resistance and does not have the spare capacity. Once the pressure from the Asian continent eases, we should concentrate all our efforts on implementing the southern expansion policy. My purpose in returning to the country this time is to inform the government of this intention. As for Taiwan's internal affairs, the most urgent task is to develop electricity. However, due to a lack of raw materials, especially iron, cement, and other materials, the results of our implementation of this plan are not very satisfactory. In addition, we also plan to establish a shipping company to completely manage Taiwan's maritime transportation and acquire the ships of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and other companies that operate in Taiwanese waters."

<p>War Report from the German Side</p>
<p>German High Command - The German High Command released a war bulletin this afternoon stating that in Flanders, German forces attacked the enemy across the Scheldt River with considerable success. The battle of Valenciennes continues. German forces have control of the forest area southeast of Valenciennes. Enemy mechanized units attacked German lines twice yesterday on the Cambrai front, but were repelled with heavy losses. German forces west of Artois continue to advance towards Calais. On the line from the Somme River to the Meuse River, the enemy is taking a defensive posture. The second line of defense of the Liège fortress has surrendered to German forces. They captured twenty officers and 650 soldiers. The enemy on the Namur front continues to defend several forts. In the air, German aircraft bombed enemy rear areas and retreating units in Flanders and Artois. German fighters and reconnaissance planes sunk three transport ships and one oil tanker near the English Channel and bombed Dunkirk and Dover. German torpedo boats sunk an enemy destroyer near Dunkirk. Due to inclement weather, both sides' air activities were hindered. The enemy lost nine aircraft, and five German aircraft are missing. A combat cruiser of the enemy near Narvik was hit by one shell in the bow and suffered heavy damage. One transport ship was sunk, and another was damaged. German aircraft also attacked ammunition depots, harbors, artillery batteries, and reinforcements. British aircraft bombed the towns of Nijmegen and Waalwijk in the Netherlands, killing several civilians. From the 10th to the 15th of this month, German anti-aircraft batteries shot down a total of 342 enemy aircraft. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - German military circles announced last night that German troops have occupied positions along 50 kilometers of the English Channel and are gradually encircling one million Allied troops in the Flanders and Artois areas. The battle for Ghent in the Flanders and Upper Scheldt area had not stopped yesterday, "but it is believed that resistance can be annihilated within a few days." The military circles also said that the cut-off British and French forces in the north are making every effort to break through the German defenses in order to escape to Arras and Amiens in the south. They denied the French claims that Arras had been recaptured. Unconfirmed German reports stated that German troops had occupied Soissons and were advancing rapidly towards Paris. The resistance of the Allied forces encircled in Flanders and Artois is "extremely stubborn, including the most elite units of France." (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin - Senior German military officials, in an interview with a reporter from the Haitong News Agency, made the following remarks supplementing the German official report: The most important fact of the Western Front situation is that the area between the English Channel and the North Sea coast and the German front line is becoming smaller. The isolated French and Belgian troops in this area are still resisting fiercely. Motorized units have repeatedly attempted to break through the encirclement but have failed. British tank units are also participating in the fighting. In general, the enemy forces trapped in the north are not only numerous but also extremely well-equipped, including several divisions of France's most elite troops and a large portion of their mechanized units. Therefore, there will inevitably be fierce battles in this area. So far, all British and French attempts to break through have failed. British and French mechanized units are inferior to Germany's in both strategy and technology. The rumors of enemy counteroffensive victories and the lack of fuel for German mechanized units are completely untrue. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - German radio warned the national public this morning that the decisive battle had not yet begun.

<p>German Vanguard's Whereabouts Uncertain; Somme River Battle Still Chaotic</p>
<p>London - Important battles were reported to have taken place between Cambrai and Valenciennes yesterday. British troops in various places are holding their front lines with light casualties. The number of German troops engaged is unknown, but the battles are said to be the most important of yesterday's fighting. British troops between Arras and Douai have launched a counterattack, but the results are not yet known. Belgian troops have also launched a counterattack against German troops who forcibly crossed the Lys River at two points, with considerable success. There are also Allied operations in the Arras area, but they do not seem to have provoked any German reaction. The situation between Arras and the Somme River is still chaotic. German light mechanized units are continuing to advance, and their advance points are now reaching south. French main forces on the Somme and Aisne Rivers are still holding their ground. Allied new Commander-in-Chief General Weygand returned to Paris last night after inspecting the country and the northern war zone of France, expressing satisfaction with the morale and material equipment of the troops, and seeing that the hard struggle of the past two weeks has not diminished the fighting spirit of the troops. Military sources in close contact with General Weygand say that the situation is still serious, but the main force of the German army has not consolidated the land occupied by its mechanized columns. The vanguard of the advancing German troops consists of motorized units equipped with automatic weapons. They cannot occupy land or hold it. Even very small units of French troops can drive them back, but these units are extremely mobile and their whereabouts are uncertain, like cavalry in the past. According to news received in London, it is known that Hitler has launched his last desperate gamble on the Western Front because he can no longer struggle through the winter. It is rumored that 500,000 German soldiers have been lost. Germany, the Soviet Union, and the Balkan Peninsula have encountered severe cold and floods, so there is no hope of harvesting much grain. Germany has gained little in Denmark. It is expected that 20% of Danish livestock will be slaughtered due to lack of feed. Danish agriculture is now on the verge of bankruptcy. Foot-and-mouth disease is rampant in various parts of Germany, and vaccines for treating the disease cannot be obtained. Furthermore, the lack of labor and the mechanization of industry make agriculture difficult for Germany. The military authorities are transferring freight cars from Romania to be used on the Western Front, reducing their ability to transport goods from the Balkan Peninsula to Germany. Moreover, due to the invasion of Belgium and the Netherlands, it is no longer possible to obtain gasoline from those two countries. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome - A special correspondent of the Italian Stefani News Agency telegraphed this morning that General Weygand's current strategic objectives are twofold: first, to adjust the new French defense line, concentrating troops along the Somme, Aisne, and Meuse rivers; and second, to rescue the British, French, and Belgian troops trapped in the Flanders and Calais areas. Therefore, Weygand ordered the troops in the Péronne area to launch a fierce attack to the north, and ordered the trapped troops to attack south to achieve a pincer effect. However, the German army responded effectively. In some areas, German heavy tank columns, with the cooperation of armored vehicles and bombers, penetrated deeply into the positions of the French and Belgian armies. German paratroopers also performed very well in combat. Many means of transportation and routes were destroyed, causing the Allied forces to feel they were in a dilemma. British armored units near Arras fought bravely, but after a fierce battle, more than half were killed or wounded, and they ultimately failed to succeed. French and Belgian troops also suffered heavy losses. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome - A special correspondent of the Italian Stefani News Agency telegraphed that there is fierce fighting in the Flanders and Calais areas. Allied forces are trying to fight a bloody path towards the coast, but the surrounding German forces are tightening the encirclement. German mechanized units, military aircraft, and paratrooper units are cooperating effectively, completely controlling the battlefield. Although the Allied forces are trying hard to find the weak points in the entire German line, in order to implement a strategy of breaking through at a certain point, the German army, no matter where it is attacked, responds with a lightning-like counterattack, leaving no opportunity for them to take advantage of. The fighting is especially fierce in the areas of Valenciennes and Arras. The British Air Force is still active, but the fighting power of the army is very weak. Due to the low birth rate of the French population, the French army participating in this war is 700,000 fewer than in 1914. If the 400,000 French troops fighting in the north are annihilated, coupled with the heavy losses suffered on other fronts, then the number of French troops will face the danger of being outnumbered.

<p>London - The British Air Ministry announced last night that British bombers hit military targets and key points, bridges, railway junctions, and trains with many bombs. Last night, British planes also bombed Stavanger airfield. When the British planes flew away, the airfield was seen engulfed in flames. Yesterday, our fighters spent the day protecting British bombers over the war zones of Belgium and northern France, engaging in multiple engagements. At least twenty-four enemy aircraft were destroyed or heavily damaged. Eight British fighters are missing. Only five aircraft from the large numbers of planes sent to bomb northern France, Belgium, and the Scandinavian Peninsula yesterday day and night did not return. British planes attacked with three objectives last night: (1) to bomb roads in Namur and Dinant and bridges over the Meuse River; (2) to attack trains on the west railway line of the Rhine River, derailing them; and (3) to destroy railway centers east of Pool, junctions, and army gathering places. A train with military supplies on the railway line between Aachen and Kleve was bombed four times in minutes by Hampton-type British bombers. The first batch of bombs destroyed the rails in front of the train, stopping it. Then, they used parachute flares to fly low and bomb and strafe. Another train near Krefeld was hit by a bomb, and the main railway south of Gelsenkirchen was also hit by a bomb at a height of 600 feet. Also, an army gathering place near Aachen was hit by thirty-six high-explosive bombs. A train with military supplies near Erkelenz was attacked by a Hampton-type British bomber, and two long sections of freight cars exploded immediately. According to a communiqué describing the situation of the British planes attacking the German vanguard on Tuesday, when viewed from above, the German vanguard was advancing rapidly and had caught up with the refugees on the road, making it difficult to distinguish them from the refugees. It was also seen that there were forty to fifty German trucks on a certain road, mixed among pedestrians, ambulances, civilian cars, and bicycles. Two Blenheim-type British planes saw a column of enemy armored vehicles three miles long and flew low to bomb them, seeing the column catch fire. British planes also intercepted a mixed column of enemy armored light tanks and escorting motorized vehicles advancing rapidly on the main road north of Abbeville, with considerable success. Another armored vehicle column, some of which were hidden in a forest near Abbeville, was heavily bombed by eleven Blenheim-type planes, dropping over 150 bombs, exploding near both sides of the column. British planes also flew to key points to bomb key roads and railway bridges, aiming to prevent military supplies and reinforcements from reaching the enemy's front lines. British planes encountered anti-aircraft guns and pom-pom guns (Maxim-type long-range automatic rapid-fire guns mounted on mobile carriages) and concentrated rifle fire all day long.

<p>Berlin - Military authorities here announced last night that, due to the rapid progress of the German army, the positions of the various armies are changing at any moment, so the military reports from various parties cannot arrive on time, especially the situation of the anti-aircraft artillery teams in the enemy's territory. The German High Command has not received detailed reports, so the German High Command has now decided to publish the reports in stages after receiving reports from that party. For example, it was previously reported that from May 10 to 15, the enemy's aircraft were shot down by German anti-aircraft batteries a total of 143. Now, gathering detailed reports from all parties, the enemy's losses amount to as many as 342 aircraft. According to investigations, the German anti-aircraft batteries have shot down one-fifth of the total number of enemy aircraft from May 10 to 15. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>Paris - Yesterday, reporters saw countless refugees on the outskirts of Paris, swarming in from Belgium and northern France in an endless stream. It is said that these people not only find it difficult to rest on the way, but also lack food. After passing through the routes bombed by German planes, most of these five or six thousand people lost their wives and mothers lost their sons. The expressions of these people seem to be dazed, and no one shows any signs of crying or disappointment. One refugee in his thirties, originally a farmer west of Brussels, told the reporter, "I am now alone. My wife and two children are unable to move. My grandparents, who are over eighty years old, have been taken care of by others. I cannot say what my family is facing now." A ten-year-old girl who fled from Maubeuge said that she had come here hastily with her mother, and was repeatedly strafed by air force machine guns on the way. Fortunately, she was not injured, but there were piles of corpses in a certain forest, and they stepped over the corpses to pass, which was extremely terrifying. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<p>London - Last night, Parliament passed the National Defense Emergency Powers Act with lightning speed, granting Churchill dictatorial powers. Both the upper and lower houses passed the bill in just two and a half hours. After the Royal Commission indicated royal approval, it immediately became law. This bill authorizes the government to amend existing laws through cabinet orders without submitting them to Parliament for approval. This method is similar to the "decree" system of various continental countries, aiming to grant the government sufficient power to adapt the entire British economy to win the war. When Lord Privy Seal Attlee initiated the passage of this bill in the Lower House, he explained that its purpose was to fully control manpower, land, banks, wartime industrial transportation, essential services, and luxury goods trade. According to Reuters' parliamentary lounge correspondent, the government's plans to control industry are very ambitious. Laborers are not only forced to transfer to wartime factories but also to land and coal mines. Control of agriculture will extend to tools. The expenses for the government to handle the transfer of laborers will be implemented by region. Existing union contracts will be maintained. However, due to the agreements with unions, there will be general accommodation for overtime rules. Wages and profits will all be under government control. The plan to control banks is almost complete. Currently, purely personal private property will not be subject to interference. However, the government, when necessary, will requisition various private properties such as cars, furniture, securities, and stocks with short notice. Among the proposed plans, the authorities have the power to forcibly evacuate civilians from certain areas when necessary. (Reuters dispatch dated the 23rd)</p>

<p>London - A new treason bill aimed at prohibiting opposition to the government's war policies and prescribing the death penalty by hanging or shooting for espionage and disruptive behavior passed its third reading in the Lower House yesterday and has been submitted to the Upper House, where it will pass all stages today. Home Secretary Anderson explained that the purpose of the bill is to adjust the legal status and remedy some possible loopholes in existing emergency legislation. The most important point is that it is considered necessary to stipulate a method to allow enemy aliens to be tried by military courts in appropriate cases. However, any British or neutral national will still retain the right to a trial by jury. Labor MP Jones immediately interjected, asking about the issue of enemies arriving in uniform. The Home Secretary replied that if the country were invaded and ordinary legal procedures could not be enforced in areas of military operations, the authorities should have the power to deal with the various treasonous acts covered by this case. The currently stipulated method is to deal with this kind of situation. Labor MP Clynes and Liberal MP Mander both approved this bill. Attorney General Sir Somerville also spoke, expressing how the bill would affect German paratroopers. Those who do not participate in the attack but only hope to engage in espionage activities will be dealt with by the methods prescribed in this bill. However, those who land and participate in the attack, even if they are wearing civilian clothes, will be treated the same as attackers in uniform and at the same time will not enjoy the benefits prescribed in international law for soldiers in uniform.

<h3 id="e28">U.S. Congress Reviews Armament Program; Base to be Established in Guam; Senate Authorizes President to Control Defense Funds; Army Expenditure Passes with Unprecedented Figure <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Washington - As the U.S. Congress is expeditiously reviewing President Roosevelt's proposed $3,000,000,000 armament program to enable the U.S. to hold the leading position in world aviation, congressional military experts today studied the acquisition of new U.S. defense bases in the South Pacific. Some here predict that the defense program will immediately establish air force and submarine bases on Guam, 1,200 miles south of Yokosuka, Japan. However, construction funds have not yet been allocated by Congress. Yesterday, the Senate gave the President a blank check of $132,000,000 without a recorded vote for the needs of promoting U.S. defense. Observers indicated that Congress's granting the President the power to freely control defense funds signals that the President may heed the Navy Department's urgent request to immediately develop Guam. Congress today studied consulting with Britain to obtain new Pacific bases, especially Christmas Island, Fanning Island, and other islands in the Phoenix Islands. A naval officer predicted that the dispute between Britain and the U.S. over the sovereignty of islands in the South Pacific will be re-examined by the two countries due to the needs of U.S. defense and the situation in Europe. The Senate Naval Committee quickly reviewed the $750,000,000 bill submitted on Tuesday, authorizing the government to establish air force bases and naval outposts around the U.S., with one-third of the funds allocated to the Pacific. When the Senate passed the $132,000,000 Army bill yesterday, it rejected the Republican proposal to establish a joint committee to monitor its use, allowing the President to control the funds to meet urgent needs. The Senate Naval Subcommittee passed a $1,458,000,000 naval supplementary bill, including $250,000,000 in cash, for the need to purchase new aircraft and build new warships. The Senate also re-debated the remaining portion of the $1,823,000,000 Army supplementary bill yesterday, which will be passed this week. (United Press dispatch dated the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington - The $1,823,254,624 bill for U.S. Army expenses and expansion was unanimously passed by the U.S. Senate yesterday. Its magnitude and speed of passage are unprecedented in peacetime. The passage of this bill indicates that President Roosevelt's proposed $3,282,001,352 program, aiming to make the U.S. impregnable against any aggressor, has been fully supported by Congress. The Army expenses passed this time include $103,300,000 for future aircraft purchases. In addition, it will be used to purchase 2,566 new aircraft, massively mechanize the Army, increase the facilities for training aircraft pilots, and add anti-aircraft guns, light artillery, and essential military supplies. After the Senate passed this bill, it immediately prepared to begin considering the $1,458,756,728 naval expansion bill tomorrow, including a reserve fund of $472,776,000, which was included in the bill by the Senate Appropriations Committee today. (International News Service dispatch dated the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington - The Senate Naval Appropriations Subcommittee has approved an additional $478,000,000 for the Navy supply bill to fund the Navy's recruitment of 25,000 new personnel. This move by the Subcommittee was first approved by President Roosevelt over the phone. Currently, the total amount of funds obtained by the Navy under the defense expansion program is $1,464,000,000, while the Army's is $1,823,000,000. The Subcommittee's action was subsequently approved by the Naval Committee. A Navy Department spokesman told a Reuters reporter that the total number of Navy recruits will increase from 145,000 to 170,000. At the same time, the House Naval Committee unanimously approved a bill to increase the naval air force to 10,000 aircraft and 16,000 pilots. The bill also proposes an appropriation of $144,000,000 for the construction of naval bases. The Senate passed the $1,823,000,000 Army appropriations bill yesterday, including most of the soft items requested in President Roosevelt's emergency defense bill. Currently, this bill has been sent back to the House for amendment. When the bill was passed in the Senate, it stipulated 2,566 military aircraft, a large number of air defense weapons, tanks and flat-trajectory guns, and the funds to increase the Army's peacetime strength from the current 37,000 to 280,000 personnel. (Reuters dispatch dated the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington - Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark told the House Naval Committee yesterday that a blitzkrieg attack on the U.S. is within the realm of possibility. Therefore, he requested the committee to authorize the Navy Department to rapidly increase naval aircraft to 10,000. He said that the Navy Department is "very confident" in the strength of certain surface warships but still needs a strong air force to enhance the "certain aspects" of the Navy's offensive capability. He added that a blitzkrieg is indeed "possible in the event of an emergency." He said that if the German air force can exert greater power, no British ships will be seen on the sea. The new model of aircraft immediately adopted by the Navy will be kept secret, and he indicated that the Navy Department opposes selling the current new model to the Allied Powers. (United Press dispatch dated the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt said in his message to Congress yesterday, "The startling results of international events have necessitated a review of the various measures needed for national security." He requested Congress to approve the transfer of immigration and naturalization matters from the Department of Labor to the Department of Justice, saying that this move would enable the government to quickly deal with aliens whose actions conflict with the public interest.

<h3 id="e29">U.S. Senator Refutes Lindbergh's Speech <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>New York - Senator Pepper responded last night on the radio to Colonel Lindbergh's broadcast speech last week criticizing the government's defense measures. It is generally believed that this represents the official government response. Pepper said that Lindbergh's qualifications to discuss foreign policy are no better than those of any other transatlantic aviator. The "Fifth Column" is already active in the U.S., and anyone who hinders the government's efforts to protect the American people, whether intentionally or unintentionally, is an effective sympathizer of the "Fifth Column." When Lindbergh said "No one wants to attack us," was he speaking on behalf of Hitler or Goering? In the current situation, can Americans accept this young gentleman's guarantee that "If we do not seek war, it will not come to us"? Pepper also responded to Lindbergh's criticism that the U.S. lacks a clear defense policy, saying that in the past two years, President Roosevelt has repeatedly declared his policy of defending the Western Hemisphere, which is a practical defense policy that has long been concretely formulated. Pepper continued by addressing Lindbergh's sarcasm that those who worry about being invaded are neurotic, saying that he believes we should thank God for finally making America feel the danger and resolutely arm ourselves for self-defense. Pepper also warned Americans that if the British Navy is forced to surrender, Hitler will likely have a navy superior to that of the U.S. Pepper finally mentioned the Japan-Germany alliance, saying that if the naval forces of Japan and Germany cooperate, he does not know whether we can rely on Lindbergh's guarantee that war will not come to America.

<p>Paris - Turkish President Inonu reaffirmed Turkey's determination to maintain the Balkan status quo yesterday when he met with Taylor, a reporter for "Paris Soir," in Ankara. President Inonu stated that Turkey strongly opposes any adventurous attempts in that area. He told Taylor, "If Turkey does not declare its insistence on adhering to the Allied Powers to maintain the Balkan status quo, what would you think of the position of Romania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Bulgaria, which are surrounded by Germany and Italy? We have mutual interests. The failure of the Allied Powers is our failure." After broadly discussing the situation in the Near East, General Inonu stated that the Allied naval reinforcements in the Mediterranean have improved the confidence of the Balkan countries. When the reporter asked about the position of Bulgaria and the Soviet Union, "The President replied that Bulgaria has repeatedly stated its guarantees of goodwill and peaceful intentions. The Soviet Union is currently very silent. We have frequent contact with them, but we cannot know their ultimate goals." Taylor stated that the impression he got while staying in Ankara was that Turkey was deeply relieved that the German army was advancing northwest instead of taking action in the Balkan southeast, as they could drag out time and complete national defense measures.

<h3 id="e39">Anglo-Soviet Trade: Negotiation Process Officially Announced by the Soviet Union <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Moscow: Regarding the progress and nature of the preliminary Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations, many reports in foreign newspapers are untrue. In this regard, TASS is now officially authorized to state the following:</p>
<p>(1) In the autumn of 1939, British Foreign Secretary Halifax indicated to the Soviet Ambassador to the UK, Maisky, that the British government was willing to begin negotiations on a trade agreement with the Soviet government. The Soviet government replied that it agreed in principle to conduct these trade negotiations. However, on the other hand, the British government took various steps to reduce and restrict trade with the Soviet Union, such as canceling Soviet orders for industrial products from the UK, detaining ships and goods bound for the Soviet Union, and adopting a hostile policy towards the Soviet Union during the Soviet-Finnish War, leading to the expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League of Nations, with the UK playing a leading role. All of these factors prevented the smooth progress of the negotiations.</p>
<p>(2) After the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, British Under-Secretary of State Butler, on March 18, 1940, again suggested to Maisky on behalf of the British government that trade negotiations be reopened. On March 27th of the same month, Maisky replied to Halifax, stating that if the British government was truly sincere in resolving Anglo-Soviet trade issues and released the Soviet ships "Salenga" and "Mayakovsky," which had been detained by the British authorities, before the negotiations began, the Soviet government could agree to reopen the negotiations. On April 19th, Halifax replied to Maisky with a British government response. In this response, the British government expressed its willingness to understand the Soviet government's exact proposals for a trade agreement, and at the same time requested the Soviet Union to guarantee that all imported goods could only be used for its own consumption and not temporarily transported to Germany. In addition, the British government conflated the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement with restrictions on Soviet trade with Germany. On April 29th, Maisky delivered the Soviet government's response to Halifax, with the following key points:</p>
<p>(A) The Soviet Union is a neutral country and has traded and will continue to trade with both neutral and belligerent countries. These trade activities are based on the Soviet Union's own needs for import and export goods.</p>
<p>(B) The Soviet Union has a trade agreement with Germany, which the Soviet Union has fulfilled and will continue to respect. The Soviet Union believes that the German-Soviet agreement should not be the subject of negotiations in discussions with third countries. At the same time, the Soviet Union does not want to use trade agreements signed by Britain with other countries as the subject of the current bilateral negotiations.</p>
<p>(C) The Soviet government is willing to restore trade relations with Britain on the basis of reciprocity, but the conclusion of such a trade agreement must not violate either party's trade obligations with other countries. When negotiating a trade agreement with the British side, the Soviet Union was indeed prepared to import goods from Britain for its own use and had no intention of re-exporting the imported goods to Germany.</p>
<p>(D) The best prerequisite for Anglo-Soviet trade agreement negotiations is the release of the Soviet ships "Salenga" and "Mayakovsky," which have been detained by the British authorities.</p>
<p>(3) On May 8th, Halifax sent a memorandum to Maisky, expressing his views on the Soviet government's response of April 29th. In this memorandum, the British government did not put forward any specific proposals, but raised new questions regarding German-Soviet trade relations as follows: the content of the German-Soviet trade agreement, the quantity and conditions of Soviet goods transported to Germany, restrictions on Soviet war material transported to Germany, and the possibility of controlling goods transiting through the Soviet Union to Germany, the use of goods imported by the Soviet Union from Britain, and the Soviet Union's market in Germany, etc. Regarding the detention of the two Soviet ships (the goods carried on the ships were bound for the Soviet Union), the British government did not give a clear answer, only stating that the ships had been transferred to the French government and suggesting that the Soviet government establish an agreement on the control of contraband. In the memorandum, Halifax solemnly stated that the British government intended to make Anglo-Soviet trade relations conform to Britain's war objectives.</p>
<p>(4) On May 20th, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov replied to Halifax's memorandum of May 8th. In this reply, the Soviet government solemnly declared that the Soviet Union would never subordinate its trade policy to the war objectives of any country. The Soviet Union is a sovereign country and can absolutely engage in trade with neutral or belligerent countries on the basis of reciprocity and equality. The new questions regarding German-Soviet trade raised by Halifax in his memorandum of May 8th are beyond the Soviet government's power to answer and cannot become the subject of bilateral trade negotiations.</p>
<p>Regarding goods imported from Britain, the Soviet government stated on April 29th that these goods were for the Soviet Union's own use and were never transshipped to Germany. As for the British explanation for the detention of the two Soviet ships, it did not convince the Soviet Union. The Soviet government believes that the British government should bear full responsibility for this action. The Soviet government believes that the British government's raising of questions that the Soviet side is unable to answer proves that the British side has no sincerity in conducting trade negotiations with the Soviet Union. (TASS dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>"Wine bag and rice sack" is a phrase that, to others, is a curse, meaning someone who only knows how to eat and doesn't know how to do anything.

<p>New York tycoon Howard Ember arrived yesterday from the U.S. aboard the President Hoover. He told reporters, "I would like to warn Americans that if the United States allows Germany to achieve absolute victory in Europe, South America will inevitably be threatened by Germany. Germany will use South America to recover the losses caused by the war, and the expansion of German economic power will be difficult to contain thereafter. So, whether through military action or other technical methods, Germany will one day become the ruler of South American countries." He believes that the U.S. should establish air bases in South America, but the terrain of South America poses many obstacles to this.</p>
<p>Germany Has Potential Power in South America</p>
<p>Germany's coveting of South America is not a recent phenomenon. Although its industry has been almost completely destroyed by the war, it can be quickly restored with great force once the war ends. Before the outbreak of the war, Germany's trade position in South America was extremely stable. The U.S. completely adopts the principle of cash payment for trade with South America, while Germany does not. Therefore, South America also has a good impression of trade with Germany. At the same time, German exchange in South America also receives preferential treatment, which is more convenient than U.S. exchange. The U.S. does not need South American commodities very much. Therefore, he doubts whether the U.S. can compete with Germany and seize a superior position in trade with South America. Germany's trade with South America is mainly in pig iron products, and a monopoly has been formed. Most of its necessities, such as wheat, meat, and oil, can be adequately supplied by South America. Even in South America, the number of German immigrants is quite considerable, forming a strong position.</p>
<p>Close Trade with Britain</p>
<p>In peacetime, South America welcomes trade with Britain the most. Britain has purchased 60% of its required goods from South America and hopes to improve the situation in South America. Therefore, the trade relationship between South America and Britain is very close, because Britain needs South America to supply various raw materials, and South America needs Britain to supply various machinery.</p>
<p>German Spokesperson Said Yesterday</p>
<p>The spokesperson of the German Embassy in China, in a press conference yesterday, in addition to stating the latest war situation in Europe, also explained the recent reports in newspapers about German planes bombing refugees, women, and children. His words were quite humorous. According to the spokesperson, "When German planes bombed the opponent's railway and highway transportation lines, it was inevitable that a small number of women and children who were fleeing on the road would be affected, but there were definitely not as many refugees killed and injured as reported by the Allied powers." The spokesperson also said, "The German side has notified the people of the other side that they can still live in their homes when the German army arrives and do not need to escape," etc. His words seemed to blame the local people for taking refuge as an unnecessary move, and the unfortunate "affected" by German planes bombing was "self-inflicted."</p>
<p>Two Italian Ships Sail to the Far East</p>
<p>According to the Italian Mail Ship Company yesterday, the company has received a telegram from Trieste, Italy, that the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso has sailed from there to the Far East. At the same time, the company's mail ship Conte Verde is also on its way to the Far East and has already departed from Bombay. Therefore, Italian ships have not been affected since the Western Front war expanded. According to the company's manager, Indiponte, yesterday, the sparse number of passengers in Trieste may affect the voyage of Conte Verde. He believes that the expansion of the war to the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and France will indeed reduce the number of passengers. Whether Italian ships can make a profit by continuing to sail on this route is still a question.</p>
<p>Belgian Fundraising Achieves Great Success</p>
<p>Since the local sculptor Zhang Chongren and others initiated fundraising to help the Belgian Red Cross with medical expenses, the response has been very enthusiastic. Belgian Ambassador Guillaume, because of this act of sympathy from people of all circles in China, attached even greater importance to it. Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., he accompanied his wife and entourage to Zhang's residence at 608 Route Pères, to visit. He praised and encouraged Zhang and his students' work very much. Zhang and the ambassador met while Zhang was studying in Belgium and obtained the Belgian King's Gold Medal. Zhang is the first Oriental artist to receive such a medal from that country. Therefore, the ambassador was very impressed by the regulation that Zhang would paint an oil painting for those who donated more than 1,000 yuan this time. The Belgian Red Cross fundraising has been very successful. As of recently, it has collected a total of 91,275.50 yuan in Chinese currency, 520 US dollars, 2,500 French francs, 18 pounds and 1 shilling in British currency, and 105,350 Belgian francs.</p>

<p>Japanese Marine Police Searched and Detained the Vessel, Negotiated by Our Side on Reasonable Grounds</p>
<p>The gentry and merchants from Ningbo residing in this city, due to the shortage of rice in various counties of Ningbo this year and the great panic among the people, after discussions between people from Shanghai and Ningbo, decided to raise 2 million yuan to purchase Yangmi (foreign rice) in Shanghai and transport it to Ningbo for relief. All the rice had been declared separately and transported out of the country in batches. The day before yesterday, another 2,000 bags of Yangmi were entrusted to the German firm Lihe Yanghang's Haifu Wheel to be loaded to Ningbo. When the barges were being transported to the outer edge of the Haifu, a number of Japanese military police from the Marine Corps suddenly came forward to stop it and seized 1,600 bags of Yangmi, forcing them to be barged to the Japanese military police's berth at the Waterfront Hotel. After learning of the news, the shipowner reasoned with the Japanese side that the Yangmi was purely for the relief of the people of Ningbo and that it had been declared for export in accordance with the customs regulations, and the procedures were completely legal, requesting its return. According to the reporter from Daguan News Agency, the Japanese side's detention of the Yangmi bound for Ningbo was reportedly due to the suspicion that the Yangmi was for military use. However, it has now been clarified that it was indeed for civilian relief, so it was all returned yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e43">China-Thailand Relations Are Cordial; Rumors of Anti-Chinese Sentiment Are Groundless; There Were No Such Demonstrations at All <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Siamese Minister to the United States, Mr. Miralemon, on his way to Washington to take office, passed through Shanghai yesterday aboard the President Taft. He solemnly refuted the rumors circulating abroad that the anti-Chinese movement in Siam was rampant, saying, "There is absolutely no anti-Chinese demonstration in Siam. The rumors circulating abroad are purely fabricated. What has been discovered in Siam from time to time is only the arrest of criminals who smoke opium, etc. Siam has never had any demonstrations against any country." Mr. Miralemon continued to describe the friendly relations between China and Siam over the years. Currently, there are a large number of Chinese residing in Siam. As for the anti-Chinese sentiment in Siam, he believes that it may be due to the fact that the Siamese government slightly increased the business rights, and most of the Chinese in Siam are businessmen who feel unhappy about this move. The overseas Chinese are trying their best to negotiate. He also believes that China has always adopted a friendly attitude towards Siam over the years, and Siam is also very willing to repay China with a friendly attitude. Therefore, anti-Chinese demonstrations are definitely not the case. Finally, he stated that Siam is now working hard to take the opportunity of the European war to find ways to renew itself.</p>

<p>Since the start of the United States Foreign Trade Week, American expatriates in this city have been celebrating enthusiastically. Yesterday, the Rotary Club hosted a grand luncheon at the Capital Hotel. At the banquet, the secretary of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, gave a speech, saying, "International trade is the lifeblood of all countries. We should have a deep belief in this concept, and we must work early to alleviate the pain of the inevitable post-war recession." He said, "Today's countries, including the richest United States, can rarely survive and prosper without relying on international supply and foreign trade. International commerce makes each other mutually beneficial, using one country's surplus to compensate for the other country's deficiency."</p>
<p>Mutual assistance and exchange benefit each other and satisfy human desires. The recent European war has not had a significant impact on the United States' foreign trade. On the contrary, it has made its trade more prosperous." Mr. Smith also talked about the United States' policies of restricting imports and controlling exchange rates, believing that these policies are good strategies to restrict personal interests and excessive development. British Commercial Advisor</p>
<p>Mr. Hegginson's speech imitated a general in the last European war, saying, "Food, food, in wartime, how can I think about food?" and said, "Business, business, in wartime, how can I think about business?" The commercial counselor of the French Embassy said in his speech, "France currently relies on foreign supply in many ways. Therefore, foreign concessions in France should maintain their neutrality to gain the friendly feelings of the countries concerned. The Shanghai French Concession authorities have been governed by this principle for three years." Song also said, "Countries that love peace are truly commendable. Therefore, although Britain and France are at war, they still keep peace in mind. The United States and France are fighting for peace."</p>
<h3 id="e45">Unpaid Income Tax Should Be Paid Quickly <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Can Go Directly to the Shanghai Office of the Bank of China to Pay</p>
<p>Since the withdrawal of the Chinese army to the west, most patriotic businessmen and people in this city have continued to pay government income tax as usual to value national tax. However, according to recent investigations, a few unscrupulous people are trying to evade paying this national tax. The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, in view of this, will start an investigation. Once found, in addition to paying the tax monthly in the future, they will also be required to pay the unpaid tax in full. It is hoped that the businessmen and people in this city who have not paid the tax in accordance with the regulations will automatically go to the Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Department of the Central Bank to pay the tax.</p>

<p>According to the Miller's Review, published today, a reader wrote to the editor of the newspaper, saying that the newspaper's previous list of pro-Japanese newspapers and magazines still had omissions. "China Digest," edited by Caroline, is also one of the pro-Japanese magazines, but it was not included. Although few people in this city read it, the magazine is funded by the Japanese and mailed to various parts of the United States in no less than several thousand copies. Caroline is now traveling and lecturing in the United States, doing her best to defend Japan. Recently, in New York, she gave a disgusting pro-Japanese speech to the press. The audience questioned her on the spot, demanding that Caroline register with the State Department in Washington as a "Japanese propagandist."</p>

<p>The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and the People's Food Relief Committee decided to increase the water freight for all incoming and outgoing goods by 50% from the 25th of this month. The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai has already cabled to request the cancellation of the original decision. The association cabled the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, the People's Food Relief Committee, Commander Guo, and County Magistrate Yu yesterday, as follows:</p>
<p>Disguised Additional Levy</p>
<p>(1) Ningbo Chamber of Commerce and People's Food Relief Committee, According to reports from the shipping industry, the people's food relief fund will increase water freight for all incoming and outgoing goods by 50%, which will be implemented from the 25th of this month. Our association does not agree with the disguised additional levy to raise relief funds, which only increases the burden on the poor. We have already telegraphed our opinion. According to reports, your office must still implement this method. Our association's intention is not adopted, which is deeply regrettable. We hope that you will reconsider and stop it, and we look forward to your reply. Respectfully, Yu Hede, Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai</p>
<p>Hinders Fundraising</p>
<p>(2) Respected Ningbo Commander Guo and County Magistrate Yu, According to Ningbo's decision, the water freight for incoming and outgoing goods will be increased by 50% to finance the people's food relief. At a time when the people's livelihood is declining, how can we further increase the burden on the people? Our association has cabled to request the cancellation of this resolution, but it has not been adopted. Fellow villagers in Shanghai are working hard to raise funds to bear half of the relief funds. Upon hearing this news, they all expressed displeasure, which greatly hinders the progress of donations. We hope that you will order the prevention of its implementation. This is our sincere plea. Yu Hede, Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai</p>

<p>No Compensation for Losses, Remittances Require Permission</p>
<p>After the sudden outbreak of the European war, postal delivery between Shanghai and Europe was not without difficulties. However, the Shanghai Postal Administration decided to find ways to facilitate delivery. All mail and packages to Europe are still forwarded via the Pacific and Suez lines, and airmail is transported via six lines. Recently, mail to Europe has increased significantly, but packages have decreased. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Requires a Permit</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited a senior official of the Shanghai Postal Administration, who said (1) All banknotes or cash of that country and Italy sent by post to Albania are prohibited. Also, all bank drafts, various checks, remittances, and other valuable documents, savings books, treasury bonds, stocks, and their interest coupons, issued in Albanian francs or Italian currency must be accompanied by a permit from the National Bank of Albania before they can enter the country. Otherwise, in addition to detaining the mail, legal sanctions will still be imposed. (2) For packages sent to France, in addition to those containing gold, all other packages containing goods must obtain a permit from the French Ministry of Commerce in advance before they can be imported. However, this does not apply to packages sent to individuals that do not contain trade characteristics. However, there must not be multiple packages sent by the same sender to the same recipient.</p>
<p>Losses Are Inevitable</p>
<p>(3) For packages to Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Germany, the sender must bear the responsibility. (4) For insured letters sent abroad containing currency, the sender must indicate the type of currency contained in the envelope, such as French currency, Japanese yen, etc. Those that do not clearly indicate the contents, (5) For mail sent abroad, the name and address of the recipient should be written in the common language of the country of destination. If only Chinese is written, Roman characters must be attached. The sender must strictly follow the instructions and bear the responsibility. The official continued that the European war is becoming more intense, so the loss of mail may be unavoidable. However, the Post Office has clear regulations (1) If the delivery of mail is due to natural disasters or events that cannot be resisted by human forces, (2) If the loss occurs within a foreign country, the Post Office is not responsible for compensation in accordance with the laws of that country.</p>

<p>The Aviemari ship of Fuxin Gold Company sailed directly to Ningbo yesterday. The ship has spacious cabins and is very suitable for transporting cargo and passengers. Its berth in this city is at the Astronomical Observatory Wharf. The loading and unloading of cargo and passengers are convenient, and the Taichangxiang Warehouse adjacent to the wharf is especially convenient for loading and unloading passengers and goods. The general office of Fuxin Company is located on the second floor of the Zhonghui Building on Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Untagged Price Vendors: Authorities Implement Public Prosecution; Ineffective Warnings Lead to Legal Action; Foreign Food Prices Decline <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Mainland reports state that the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) is vigorously cracking down on merchants engaged in illegal profiteering. It will initiate public prosecution against twenty vendors who have failed to mark the prices of their goods early next week. According to a member of the Price Equalization Committee, this move by the Shanghai Municipal Council marks the beginning of more forceful action against those who illegally raise the prices of food and goods. In the future, any shop owner who refuses to mark the prices of goods will also be brought before the court. The Shanghai Municipal Council has repeatedly warned these twenty vendors, but they have turned a deaf ear. Therefore, the decision has been made to resort to legal action. The reason why this action was not taken earlier was to allow merchants sufficient time to prepare price tags and other procedures, and to make them understand that the Shanghai Municipal Council would keep its word.</p>
<p>Price Regulations</p>
<p>Although the French Concession Public Works Bureau (法租界公董局) has not yet initiated public prosecution against any merchants, the action of the Shanghai Municipal Council is in cooperation with the Public Works Bureau, so it is expected that the French Concession will take similar action soon. At the same time, inspectors from the Shanghai Municipal Council continue to inspect markets and shops within the concession to see if they are complying with the regulations set by the Bureau for the sale of food. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council has not yet regulated prices, so there has been no action taken on the issue of different prices for the same item. It is believed that customers will naturally purchase from store A if they see that its price is lower than store B, which will prompt store B to reduce its price. With the recent rebound in the value of the legal tender (法幣), food prices in the city showed a downward trend yesterday. For example, the prices of butter and alcoholic beverages, which are everyday foods for foreigners, have already fallen.</p>
<p>Quality and Weight</p>
<p>The French Concession Price Equalization Committee held a meeting at the French Concession Public Works Bureau on Avenue Joffre (霞飛路) at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than ten Chinese and French committee members attended. They discussed in detail the quality and prices of daily necessities for Chinese people, such as rice and coal, and daily necessities for Westerners, such as bread and meat. It is reported that the French Concession Public Works Bureau will pay close attention to whether the quality and weight of daily necessities are commensurate with their prices, and will impose penalties for any deception or trickery. As for the reports in Western newspapers that the Price Equalization Committee will establish a special apartment committee to handle rental disputes and crack down on key money (挖頂費), this discussion was not brought up yesterday because the issue is complex and Chinese cases are usually handled by the French Court, while lease disputes involving foreigners are handled by the French Consulate.</p>
<p>Bread Too Expensive</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, the French Concession Price Equalization Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon. During the meeting, committee members felt that the price of bread, which is currently selling for 50 cents per pound, seemed too expensive. Therefore, they decided to contract a baker to specialize in baking a new type of bread with a lower price, setting the price at 35 cents, for use by the troops stationed in the city. As for the establishment of a "Foreign Merchants' Market," it is reported that the Committee has postponed its implementation. However, before the "Foreign Merchants' Market" is established, a strict inspection of the quality and prices of daily necessities sold in stores will be carried out to ensure that prices are not too high and affect the livelihood of ordinary people.</p>

<p>The area on North Kiangsi Road (北江西路) in the Jia District (甲區) of the north bank of Suzhou Creek, which has been blocked by the Japanese with barbed wire since last autumn, has only left two gaps at Haining Road (海寗路) and Boone Road (文監師路) for pedestrians to enter and exit, making traffic extremely inconvenient. Starting yesterday, the barbed wire fence in the middle of the Boone Road gap on North Kiangsi Road has been removed by Japanese soldiers, so cars and cargo trucks can now pass through the gap without obstruction. However, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency (大通社) who inspected the area yesterday, although the barbed wire fence in the middle has been removed, there are still very few vehicles entering and exiting.</p>

<p>The chaotic and noisy scene transforms into a quiet and fragrant atmosphere. This is the first impression that the 64th Flower Show at the Race Club gives to visitors upon entering.</p>
<p>Under the early summer sun, watching a few horses lazily circle around in the opposite yard, head to tail, stepping out of the empty and desolate arena into the flower-filled display room, looking around, it seems that everything is still, yet everything is full of life.</p>
<p>The sounds of conversation and footsteps from the visitors interweave together, floating in the light, warm, and soft air. It seems that everyone's heart is immersed in the fragrant and rich floral nectar, involuntarily making people intoxicated.</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the show, and there were still many visitors. In two corners of the room, thick and dense flower mountains were arranged, labeled "Produced by the Shanghai Municipal Council" (工部局出品). The flowers were clustered together, a riot of colors, a collective performance of flowers, it can be said that it wins by "quantity."</p>
<p>This part includes genera such as Platycodon, Rorippa, Iberis, Chrysanthemum, and perennial chrysanthemums. There are many technical terms that are difficult for laypeople to understand, like holding a doctor's prescription.</p>
<p>The violets produced by Mr. Zhou, from the Violet Nursery, who won the Grand Championship twice and the Peter Grand Silver Cup – the meticulous work of my colleague Zhou Shoujuan (周瘦鵑) – are the most likely to attract the attention of visitors.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou's works are all exquisite and delicate. On the central table, a "Banana Buddha" (蕉卜達摩) is enshrined in the center. The giant banana is shrunk into a pot, a true spectacle. Below is a pot of "Oars Returning to the Boat" (款乃歸舟). In the shallow pot, mountains and rocks are arranged, and short trees grow in the crevices of the rocks. Next to it is a cluster of verdant grass, like reeds. A leaf-shaped boat is placed in the middle of the stream, very lovely.</p>
<p>The table on the right is labeled "Eight Treasures" (八珍) – representing the materials for eight potted plants – including: jade, stone, porcelain, copper, brick, sand, bamboo, and wood. Planted inside are Impatiens balsamina, mountain stones, monthly roses, honeysuckle, Kerria japonica, Myrsine africana, bamboo, and pansies.</p>
<p>The small items displayed on the left, many small toys are placed on the miscellaneous shelf, including a small maple bonsai, two and a half inches tall, small grass, elm, Jasminum nudiflorum, Pinus thunbergii, cypress, Myrsine africana, and crabapple. These small plants are all planted in specially selected pots, expressing the planter's skills in an ancient atmosphere.</p>
<p>In addition, there are Ganoderma lucidum-shaped small elms, half of which are red estrildids, climbing roses, and Jasminum nudiflorum; Virginia creeper on stones, ginkgo, pine deer, and Linaria – flowers like small wisteria, fragrant.</p>
<p>Located in the center, overlooking everything, is a honeysuckle in an ancient tripod, swaying gracefully, with a unique style. Visitors admire Mr. Zhou's works very much.</p>
<p>Other exhibits include bonsai and potted plants by Kong Zhiqing (孔志清); various flower arrangements in vases, table decorations, and horticultural products. Except for Mr. Kong, who is Chinese, all other products are made by Westerners. Many of the children's works are from students in schools, the youngest being under eight years old. Their displays are naturally simpler and more unadorned. (E.L.)</p>

<p>Regarding the assassination of Xie Zhiting (謝芝庭) in front of the Metropolitan Dance Hall on the evening of the 6th of this month, the puppet "Municipal Government" (偽「市府」) sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council requesting the arrest of the perpetrators. It is now known that the Council has replied. The translation is as follows:</p>
<p>Facts of the Case</p>
<p>In response to your letter of the 8th of this month regarding the shooting of Mr. Xie Zhiting, "Councilor of the Municipal Government," in front of the Metropolitan Dance Hall on the evening of the 6th of this month, this Bureau is aware of the incident and expresses its regret for such an unfortunate event. Recently, political and other armed crimes have been repeatedly seen in this city. This Bureau is deeply concerned and hopes to obtain the cooperation of all parties so that the state of security and order expected by both forces can be restored. The facts of the case are as follows: Mr. Xie was a regular customer of the Metropolitan Dance Hall. On the evening of the 6th of this month, before 11:00 PM, he was at the entrance of the hall, about to board a chartered car, when he was shot three times by a Chinese man. Afterward, the assailant, along with three accomplices, fled along Gordon Road.</p>
<p>Council's Opinion</p>
<p>This Bureau expresses its sincere regret for this case. However, for the benefit of all parties, this Bureau must inform your "Municipal Government" that in the future, personnel of your "Municipal Government" entering the Public Concession must seek appropriate methods of self-defense. The Police Department of this Bureau will provide protection to the best of its ability, but the Department requires cooperation. Many personnel of your "Municipal Government" often enter and exit public places at night without taking self-defense measures for their own safety, and the Police Department has not been informed of their actions. In view of the foregoing, in addition to ordering the arrest of the perpetrators, we hereby respond for your information.</p>

<p>Gao Baojun (高寶鈞), a native of Jiangbei, is 37 years old and runs a rickshaw hostel at No. 433 Lane, Latourelle Road (拉都路) in the French Concession. Yang Jiachen (楊家臣), a 52-year-old rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, lives in Shanghai alone and resides at Gao's place. Recently, he suddenly fell ill and died on the morning of the day before yesterday at 2:00 AM after treatment proved ineffective. Unexpectedly, Gao did not make arrangements for a coffin but wrapped the corpse in straw mats and discarded it outside the lane about four or five houses away at dawn. After seeing it, the constable reported to the police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. They learned that the corpse had been carried out and abandoned by Gao. Because he violated the regulations and acted against humanity, Gao was detained in the police station. At the same time, Yang's corpse was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Mortuary for examination. Yesterday, a report was made to Prosecutor Zhao of the Second Special District Court, who came to the scene to examine the body and ordered it to be handed over to the Charity Hall for burial, pending identification by relatives. In the afternoon, the police station escorted Gao to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police station lawyer filed a lawsuit against him for the crime of abandoning a corpse and explained the case. Subsequently, the investigating officer reported the discovery and arrest of the defendant. Gao Baojun confessed that he had no ability to purchase a coffin, so he carried the corpse out and abandoned it. Judge Zhang Minsheng reviewed the confession and ordered the case to be closed. The defendant was detained to await a judgment.</p>

<p>Zhou Meijun (周梅君), a 23-year-old local dancer at the Paramount Ballroom (仙樂舞宮), formerly a famous socialite, lives in Room 2, Second Floor, No. 976, Xingye Fang, Bubbling Well Road (靜安寺路). On February 20th of this year, after Zhou finished dancing and returned home, she suddenly discovered that all of her four hundred yuan in soft currency and seven hundred yuan in Paramount dance tickets were missing. At the time, Zhou did not report it to the police station. However, it is said that the Paramount Ballroom's dance tickets, priced at five yuan or more, are similar in style to banknotes, and the face of the ticket also indicates the denomination in yuan. The thief mistakenly thought they were legal tender and stole them as well. Later, after realizing that they were dance tickets and could not be cashed in, he returned more than five hundred yuan worth of dance tickets in a letter the other day. However, in addition to stating in the letter that he had mistakenly stolen the dance tickets and expressed his deep apologies, he also asked Zhou Meijun to exchange them for two hundred yuan in cash, and put them back in the original letter, and place them on the landing of the stairs downstairs, where he would come to pick them up, otherwise she should be careful of her life, etc. Zhou then reported it to the Bubbling Well Road police station, who dispatched detectives Lu Yunmai and Liang Junshan to Zhou's residence to wait in ambush. At the same time, Zhou was instructed to still place a bundle of dance tickets, covered with a one-yuan legal tender note, in the letter and place it on the side of the stairs. At around 7:00 PM the night before last, Zhang Zhancai (張展財) and Wang Yuelian (王月連), both from Yangzhou, came to pick up the envelope.</p>
<p>Captured by Detectives</p>
<p>They were arrested and taken to the police station. It was discovered that Zhang was the son of the maid hired by a Filipino musician named Fei Liebin (斐列賓) in Room 1 on the first floor of the apartment building. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police station lawyer, Zhang Tianyin (張天蔭), stated the case and requested detention. According to Zhou Meijun's complaint and questioning of Zhang and Wang, their statements were evasive. The court ordered them to be detained and interrogated again in seven days.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Zhao Hongxing Foundry Privately Melts Copper Coins for Profit; Many Copper Coins and Copper Ingots Confiscated; Factory Owner and Apprentice Arrested <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>In the past, the types of currency in our country were simple, with only silver and cash. Since the casting of cash was taken over by the government, unscrupulous people, in order to make a profit, secretly bought large cash coins and recast them into small cash coins. The government, considering these traitors to be harming the country and the people, strictly prohibited this, and offenders were punished with the death penalty. Until the late Qing Dynasty, the copper coin was born, and one coin could be used as ten or twenty cash coins. If the large and small cash coins were recast into copper coins, the profit would be even greater. At that time, there were few civilians who did this, and most of them were openly set up factories and cast coins by warlords who controlled the region. Therefore, since the Republic of China, copper coins have flooded the market, especially in Sichuan, Hunan, and Wuhan. The exchange rate for each silver coin fell to as low as several hundred coins. A year before the August 13 Incident, the National Government implemented a currency reform and, because the types of currency gradually increased, in order to prevent unscrupulous people from counterfeiting and damaging them, it promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Currency System to supplement the small amount of crimes stipulated in the current criminal law. As the War of Resistance against Japan began and the European War followed, the value of non-ferrous metals rose immeasurably, which gave the traitors a great opportunity to make a fortune from the national crisis. They scoured around, and the copper coins worth ten or twenty cents each were privately set up furnaces to melt copper for sale, so that whether old-style copper coins or fractional copper coins have disappeared. According to various copper and tin shops, the current market price of this item is between 80 and 55 coins for each legal tender. Those who specialize in collecting copper coins for melting copper, because there is no large amount available in Shanghai, have even turned to the countryside and the occupied areas along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines and the Yangtze River to collect them. It is reported that although there are still many places in the mainland where copper coins are used, the price has been raised due to the Japanese's eagerness to buy them. However, if they can be transported to Shanghai, they can still earn double the profit. However, those who specialize in this business also know that the national law is strict, and they have been melting them secretly. Therefore, although the police authorities have heard rumors, they have never been able to crack down on them. Until the day before yesterday, detectives from the New Market Police Station (新閘捕房) discovered that the Zhao Hongxing Foundry (趙鴻興翻砂廠) at No. 17, Lane 579, Mohawk Road (梅白克路) had set up a furnace to melt copper coins. They immediately reported it to the First Special District Court, and the court issued a search warrant and rushed into the factory for a detailed search.</p>
<p>Under Search</p>
<p>They discovered furnaces and utensils for melting copper ingots in the corner, and crushed copper and copper coins were placed next to the furnace, which were confiscated by the detectives. There were also 2,500 un-melted copper coins hidden under the bed, which were also found. The detectives then arrested the factory owner, Zhao Houlu (趙厚祿) from Hubei, and the employee, Qiu Kouzi (仇扣子) from Jiangbei, and escorted them to the First Special Court yesterday morning along with the evidence. The Shanghai Municipal Council's acting lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a public lawsuit against Zhao and Qiu based on Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations on Currency System. The presiding judge believed that this case was important, and the criminals seemed ignorant. In addition to appointing a lawyer to defend them, he also explained the reasons why the new and old laws severely punished private melting of national treasures, and ordered them to truthfully confess how long they had been engaged in this illegal activity and how much profit they had made. Unexpectedly, Zhao only nodded and pleaded for leniency. After repeated questioning, he confessed to melting for six weeks, and that the copper coins bought for each legal tender could be sold for 1.8 yuan after being melted into copper ingots. When Qiu Kouzi was questioned, he confessed that the melting work was done by apprentices who assisted the factory owner and that he did not participate.</p>
<p>The Court's Interrogation Concluded</p>
<p>The court ordered a verdict to be announced on May 30. The copper items, etc., were stored in the warehouse, and Zhao and Qiu were escorted back to the New Market Police Station by detectives in a prison van for detention. This type of case is rarely discovered, and it is not as common as counterfeiting banknotes. It is expected that after the verdict, those who specialize in this business will know to be vigilant.</p>

<p>Rong Zhimin (榮志敏), the owner of the Yuanyue Hardware Store (源裕五金號) at No. 4, Lane 702, Peking Road (北京路), received a threatening letter from gangsters on the 14th of this month. The envelope was addressed to Wang Rujie (王如捷) from a certain number on Jessfield Road (極司斐爾路), and the letter inside was signed by Wang Rujie, the representative of the Shanghai Youth National Salvation Corps Ten Brothers Special Agent Party (上海靑年救國團十弟兄特務黨代表人). The letter stated, in essence, that Rong's business was very prosperous, so he was asked to subsidize the group's expenses with 20,000 yuan. He was asked to send the money to No. 76 Yuyuan Road (愚園路) on the 15th, otherwise his entire family would be in danger. Rong ignored it. Subsequently, he received a total of three letters. On the afternoon of the 22nd, Rong suddenly received a phone call from the gangsters, instructing him to send 300 yuan to the intersection of Avenue Foch (愛文義路) and Changsha Road (長沙路) by 5:00 PM. Rong instructed a representative to go, but no one came to contact him. Then, another phone call came, instructing him to send the money to the above location by 7:00 PM, and the person coming must hold a Sin Wan Pao (新聞報) in hand, with the words "Sin Wan Pao" facing outwards. Rong then reported it to the Old Market Police Station (老閘捕房), who dispatched Chinese detectives Sun Dafa (孫大發), Huang Cifu (黃賜福), and Zhou Zhengxing (周正興) to wait in ambush. As expected, a young man came and spoke with Rong's representative, and took the 300 yuan and was counting it when the detectives stepped forward and arrested the man. Upon questioning, he identified himself as Fang Caichun (方財春), from Ningbo, 18 years old, living at No. 30, Yu Gu Village, Yuyuan Road (愚園路). He was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police station lawyer, Ru Baozhen (汝葆彝), requested permission for detention because further investigation was needed. Under questioning by Judge Jiang Shuzhi (姜樹滋), he was ordered to be detained and interrogated again on a later date.</p>

The reason for the newspaper's suspension was notified to the newspaper by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department yesterday, but the length of the suspension is currently unknown.

<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, various foreign needles have become difficult to transport and production has decreased. Therefore, the business of domestic manufacturers has become several times more profitable. The Tiangong Needle Factory (天工製針廠) at No. 80, Route Conty (康悌路) in the French Concession, in order to increase its production, used a new type of machine. Yin Zhizhong (尹致中) from Shandong, of the Dazhong Industrial Society (大中工業社) on Route Cardinal Mercier (賈西義路), reported to the French Police Station that the Tiangong Factory's machine was similar to the CCY type three-speed machine that he had applied for patent protection. He accused Shen Ganting (沈幹庭), the manager of the Tiangong Factory, of imitating a patented product. The police station initiated a public lawsuit, and the first instance court sentenced Shen to six months of imprisonment, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day. Shen refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyers Xu Wufang (許武芳) and Yuan Yang'an (袁仰安) to appeal to the High Third Branch Court, arguing that Shen's machine was very different from Yin's patented product, and that the three-purpose machine had long been used in Europe, America, and Japan, and that in fact, needle manufacturers in this city had this equipment. After a detailed investigation by the High Third Branch Court, it ruled yesterday afternoon, "Main Text" that the original verdict was revoked and Shen Ganting was found not guilty.</p>

<p>To the Editor, The section on social news on the 23rd of this month, "Yonghe Refinery Clearing Litigation," contains content that is mostly inconsistent with the facts. The case had been heard by the First Special District Court and the minutes of the shareholders' meeting had been presented in court, not specifically stipulating that the agreed price was between 18,000 and 20,000 yuan, and even authorizing the shareholders who were negotiating to have the power to represent the factory in making an offer. Shareholders Zhu Chunrong (朱春榮) and Zhu Qinzuo (朱欽祚) signed before and after the resolution, and therefore there was no way to quibble. The transaction price was indeed 20,000 yuan, which was proven by the lawyer of Liuming Company (麗明公司), Lu Jia. Ling Keming (凌克明), the original intermediary, also came to the case to make a statement, and the court's investigation found that Wang He'an (王和安) and Peng Xuehai (彭學海) were not guilty. We hereby report the facts for your information and hope that this letter will be published to make a correction. Wang He'an and Peng Xuehai, May 23rd.</p>
<p>To the Editor, I recently read the news column in your newspaper, which contained the article "Abandoning His Wife and Forming a New Relationship." It said that Fuhui Western Clothing Store (福惠西服店) was opened by Dong Yimin (董亦敏), which is deeply shocking. Our company is a partnership, and there is no Dong Yimin among the shareholders. I think it is a misrepresentation of rumors. I hereby write to you and hope that your newspaper will allow this letter to be published to make a correction.

<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) Since the war of resistance, transportation has been difficult in various places, and the prices of books and stationery in the rear have soared, affecting the development of education and culture. The Ministry of Education is actively planning remedies. On May 10th, according to Minister Chen Lifu's words to reporters, the Ministry is negotiating with major bookstores such as Commercial Press, Chung Hwa Book Company, and Zhengzhong Book Company to reduce costs and sell at low prices to alleviate the burden of books for primary and secondary school students. The principle is to reduce the font size of textbooks without affecting eyesight, and to ensure that the cover does not detract from its appearance. In addition, diagrams and charts should be enlarged and drawn into dedicated pages for hanging in the classroom. In addition, the Ministry will subsidize major bookstores such as Commercial Press to establish printing factories in major cities in the rear, such as Chongqing, to publish books and solve transportation difficulties.</p>

<p>A total of six teams participated in the International Cup Women's Table Tennis League, using a double round-robin system. The China Athletic Federation Women's Team had the best record, followed by the Women's Youth Team and the Peide A Team. The Women's Youth Team and the Peide A Team had equal scores. Both teams had one last game remaining. Last night at 8:00 PM, the Women's Youth Team played its last game against Su Keer at the Russian Emigrant Sports Club. This game was related to the outcome of the second place. Chen Linsheng, the coach of the Women's Youth Team, personally supervised the game. The female players showed their power. Zhang Yongru, Huang Tongyin, Wang Guangmei, and Fang Xiuwen, the four female knights, were able to block, chop, and smash freely, and their momentum was like a broken bamboo, winning ten consecutive games. Miss Lai Weihen of Su Keer worked hard and defeated Wang Mingxia of the Women's Youth Team with a score of 21-19, winning a valuable point. As a result, the Women's Youth Team defeated Su Keer 13-1. All the standings have now been completed. Only one game remains between the China Athletic Federation Women's Team and the Peide A Team, which will be held in the middle of next week. The China Athletic Federation Women's Team is currently in first place with a record of seven wins and one loss. The Women's Youth Team won the second place with a record of six wins and three losses. The hope of the Peide A Team defeating the China Athletic Federation Women's Team is extremely slim, and they will be tied for third place with the Jewish Women's Team. In this women's league, the two strong women's teams from China have maintained a consistent spirit, taking it as their duty to overcome the Western teams, and winning the championship and runner-up, winning a lot of glory for the international table tennis world, which is commendable. The scores of the Women's Youth Team's victory over Su Keer are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Yongru: 4 wins, 0 losses</p>
<p>Huang Tongyin: 3 wins, 0 losses</p>

<h3 id="e90">Finance: Foreign Exchange Shows a Hesitant Trend <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the official exchange rates. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, fluctuations were mediocre, hovering around the levels of 41/125 pence and 5.5 yuan. Although news of the European war is still a concern for the general public, panic has decreased, and foreign banks' appetite for absorbing foreign exchange is quite strong, with active inflows and outflows. Therefore, there was no major reaction in trading. In the early morning, due to the repatriation of exchange, the British currency was tight and the American currency was loose. Later, due to the eagerness of foreign banks to supply foreign exchange and ample funds, the market situation hardened. From 9:40 AM, the exchange absorbed shillings, causing Chinese merchants to buy heavily, and the market turned tight. However, the situation was still calm at noon. The market remained calm in the afternoon. Although speculators were short, they were not important. Later, as Japanese merchants tended to sell, prices gradually loosened. As a result, the British exchange rate was 41/125 pence, and the American exchange rate was 5.5625 yuan, which was slightly tighter by 0.015625 compared to the previous day, while the American currency was harder by 0.03125. The same was true for futures.</p>
<p>British and American Exchange Repatriation</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to the large London exchange rate, both near and far terms fell by 13/8 pence. The New York silver price remained flat, and the London gold price remained fixed. The exchange rates for British against American, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The American currency rose 6.5 points against the mainland, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and rose slightly against French currency. The central listed exchange rates were as follows: The bank opened spot selling prices in the morning, with the British exchange rate at 41/115 pence and the American exchange rate at 5.5625 yuan, which was slightly tighter by 0.015625 and harder by 0.03125 compared to the previous day's closing price. This was due to the repatriation of exchange. After the opening, foreign bankers initially sold heavily, but Chinese merchants and speculators bought in, but the amount was small, so the situation loosened and hardened. It is estimated that foreign banks sold American exchange for June to Chinese merchants and speculators at 5.25 yuan. Soon, HSBC saw the cheapness and absorbed spot shillings, with a price of 41/15625 pence, which may have been a purchase on behalf of the Equalization Committee. HSBC's listing was announced as unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced to be reduced by 7.75%. Subsequently, Chinese merchants and speculators saw HSBC's strong appetite for absorption and also increased their buying, so the market gradually tightened. It was first beneficial to sell American exchange for June to Chinese speculators at 5.21875 yuan. In addition, foreign banks sold American exchange for May to Chinese merchants at 5.4375 yuan. At that time, the spot shilling was the softest at 41/0625 pence, and the American exchange rate was also reported at 5.4375 yuan. By 10:30 AM, the situation stabilized, and the price hardened slightly. It is estimated that Hong Kong Telecom once sold American exchange for June to foreign banks at 5.25 yuan. The closing results were a British exchange rate of 41/09375 pence, an American exchange rate of 5.5 yuan, a British exchange rate of 41/09375 pence for this month, an American exchange rate of 5.46875 yuan, a British exchange rate of 39/375 pence for next month, and an American exchange rate of 5.21975 yuan, which was tighter by 0.03125 and softer by 0.0625 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Slightly Selling</p>
<p>The market situation was still stable at the initial opening in the afternoon, because speculators were still buying, and the price was similar to that in the morning. It is estimated that foreign banks sold 5.5 yuan for May and 5.25 yuan for June to Chinese speculators. Afterwards, it was heard that Japanese merchants were slightly selling, so the closing results showed that the market was slightly harder, with the British exchange rate at 41/125 pence and the American exchange rate at 5.5625 yuan, the British exchange rate at 41/109375 pence for this month, the American exchange rate at 5.3125 yuan, the British exchange rate at 39/953125 pence for next month, and the American exchange rate at 5.28125 yuan. Compared to the previous day's spot, the British exchange rate was slightly tighter by 0.015625, and the futures were also each by 0.015625. As for the difference between the spot and futures rates, they were uniformly softer by 0.03125.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Foreign Currencies Rising <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies rose due to the final rise in gold prices, so the demand for British and American gold pounds increased slightly, and the price rose by 1 yuan. British gold tickets also tended to rise by 1 yuan because the Equalization Committee was absorbing British exchange in the black market. American gold tickets initially traded at 17.7 yuan, and then the Equalization Committee came to absorb foreign exchange, thus rising to 18.2 yuan. In the afternoon, it retreated to 17.85 yuan, but it was still up by 0.15 yuan from the previous day's close. Hong Kong tickets rose by 0.05 yuan with the rise in the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. In addition, currencies such as French francs, Annam, and Philippine tickets were also in demand, and market prices all tended to rise.

<h3 id="e93">Only 140 Yuan of Ups and Downs Yesterday <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold unofficial market situation rebounded upwards. Observing the recent changes, it was like a tug-of-war, with alternating rises and falls. This was because the development of the European situation was difficult to predict, the exchange market reported frequent tightening and loosening, and the strength of the bulls and bears was even. Therefore, the market returned as soon as it fell, and rose again after returning. The buying sentiment was quite strong at the opening this morning, and the opening was 40 yuan higher, at 5800 yuan. Soon, money changers, securities firms, etc. were all entering, and although the bank's group was trying to sell, the buying spirit was higher due to the tightening of foreign exchange. The high price of 5940 yuan was seen not long after. Later, it was heard that the exchange market had loosened, and banks and money changers sold one after another, falling to 5815 yuan. At noon, the Hong Kong gang suddenly bought again, and it once again rose to 5870 yuan. The noon closing price was 855 yuan. The initial prospects for the afternoon market were still good. Later, many retail day traders hurriedly closed their positions, and the selling pressure was more than the buying pressure, so the price was suppressed. As a result, the closing price was 5825 yuan, which was up 65 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was light throughout the day, with about 2000 taels. The result of gold jewelry prices rising was 10 yuan. Customs gold, etc. remained flat. Since the morning, each bar (10 taels) was initially nervous, and it was raised by 40 yuan as soon as it opened. A bank entered the gold market at 5800 yuan for 10 taels. A certain money changer entered a jewelry gang at 5850 yuan for 10 taels. But at that time, although the securities gang and a certain money changer continued to absorb, there were still banks and gold shops selling a lot, so the market situation was slightly stable at that time. But soon the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened, and the buying wind gradually strengthened, and the sellers scattered, and the price soared by 100 yuan. The securities gang entered a bank for 30 taels at 5940 yuan. After this, the exchange market suddenly reported a hardening, the buying wind stalled, and a certain money changer turned from buying to selling, and gold shops and banks also came to sell, and it fell back by 125 yuan. A gold shop sold 10 taels to a jewelry shop at 5815 yuan. Then the securities gang came back to absorb, and a certain bank also took advantage of the low price to cover its short positions, and the Hong Kong gang was active in the middle, and it rose again by 55 yuan. A gold shop entered a bank for 20 taels at 5870 yuan. The buying wind gradually dissipated at noon, a certain bank and retail investors sold, and the price saw a small rebound again. A jewelry gang entered a gold shop for 20 taels, making the noon closing price 5855 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was firm, rising by 15 yuan. First, a gold shop entered a money changer for 10 taels at 5870 yuan. But after the opening, a certain gold shop first sold heavily, and the bank followed suit, and the market turned downwards, retreating to 5850 yuan. Later, a certain jewelry shop also helped customers to exit their long positions, and the scattered retail investors unloaded a large amount of their floating longs in the morning, and there was a great lack of buyers in the market, and it fell again by 30 yuan. A bank did 30 taels of business, at 5820 yuan. Then a gold shop entered a money changer for 10 taels, making the evening closing price 5825 yuan. As a result, it was up 65 yuan from the previous day, with a full day of ups and downs of 140 yuan. The selling price of cash gold was 10 yuan higher than the unofficial price, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The price of silver and gold jewelry per tael was initially suspended at 510 yuan by the Datong Bank. At 9:30, it rose by 10 yuan, and it rose by 10 yuan again in less than a quarter of an hour.

<p>Yesterday's off-market securities trading was very quiet. The market situation was generally stable, akin to the stillness in foreign exchange and gold, a scene of all things silent, awaiting the rain. The dull situation remained unchanged throughout the day. One could say that foreign exchange and gold were waiting for Italy to express its position, but public bonds had no initial connection to this, yet they also tended to stagnate. The entire day's trading was particularly sluggish in the afternoon. The meeting lasted less than a quarter of an hour before adjourning. Price fluctuations were also minimal. However, the long-dormant 96 bonds saw one or two ten thousand yuan's worth of transactions, rising from four yuan eight jiao to five yuan. The final market prices showed mixed gains and losses of one or two jiao. Compared to the market prices of April 9th, the 96 bonds were slightly lower by one and a half jiao. The total transaction volume was estimated at over 400,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 59.55　59.45 59.55 Up 0.15</p>

<p>Unified E 49.70　49.55 49.70 Up 0.15</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Bank of Communications were traded at a price of 68 yuan.</p>
<p>For public stocks, conflicting news continued to emerge from Europe. The outcome of the war remains uncertain. However, overall, the situation seems to have improved somewhat. For the stock market to reverse its course amid this major downturn, it undoubtedly needs more decisive catalysts. Yesterday's trading was not deserted, and prices also saw slight improvements. Measuring by the profitability of various companies, the current stock prices are lower than their intrinsic value, which seems excessive. However, this point is not something that the average person is willing to research at the moment, as the very foundation of our entire civilization is currently being destroyed.</p>
<p>British-American Tobacco shares were again the most popular, with 53,500 shares traded. Their trend was also the most like the instability of duckweed. The highest price was 26.5 yuan, the lowest price was 21.5 yuan, and the closing price was 25 yuan with buyers. Jardine Matheson shares also saw demand, recovering to a closing price of 34.5 yuan after seeing a low of 31.5 yuan. International, Yangtze, Shanghai Land, and Steel also all attracted buyers, but prices remained low as before. Wheelock Marden shares initially appeared in poor shape, but gradually improved later, closing at 56 yuan bid and 60 yuan asked for old shares. Rubber stocks' trend remained soft.</p>
<p>London, 22nd (Wednesday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds remain stable, with no changes in either the upper or lower tiers of bonds.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Yarn and Cloth: Cotton Yarn Meets High Prices, Still Sees Hedging Sales; Yueqin Settlement Concluded <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is generally weak. Although there is no large-scale demand, sporadic purchases from Hong Kong are still decent, so sentiment remains stable. However, the overseas cotton industry situation is still in a state of decline, so some continue to hedge sell when prices rise.</p>
<p>The opening of the current yarn market was peaceful in sentiment. All aspects of materials have no bullish factors. In addition, the decline in Indian cotton is particularly fierce. Although buyers in the market are calling for higher prices, few are accepting them. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,325 yuan. Soon after, it was heard that foreign exchange was still loose, and it fell back to 1,280 yuan. Finally, with the support of Guangbang's sales channels, it saw another step up. It was found that 1,375 bales were traded in half a day. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 18 yuan. Today, 2,770 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 1,290 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 35 pieces to Haikou, and 120 pieces to Haiphong. The amount of purchases from each gang is listed as follows:</p>

<p>Cotton trading is particularly lacking in development. This is because overseas cotton markets are volatile. Although American cotton is rising, Indian cotton is falling even more sharply, so people's emotions are mixed. Trading from all sides is very quiet.</p>

<p>The rice market opened weakly yesterday morning. Due to the difficulty in grasping the market trend, both buyers and sellers dared not act rashly. Whether actual sales or speculative transactions, there were few problems. Those holding goods slightly loosened their holdings, so each type of goods depreciated by two or three jiao, such as Xiaowen rice at 46.7 yuan and No. 2 Siamese rice at 46.5 yuan. However, almost immediately, the market was rumored to be serious about the European war, which will impose controls on the export of foreign rice from the production area. It was also heard that gold and foreign exchange were stable, which made people's hearts firm again. Most turned from selling to buying. Customers from the interior, such as Ningbo and Shaoxing, were particularly eager to collect, and the absorption of No. 2 Siamese rice, which has the cheapest price, was unabated, accounting for 5,000 to 6,000 bags. The total transaction volume for the entire day was more than 10,000 bags. The market price rose steadily after the opening in the morning. Xiaowen rice opened at 46.7 yuan and closed at 48 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it opened at 48.3 yuan and closed at 48.6 yuan, which was a rise of 1.6 yuan compared with the closing price of 47 yuan the night before. Other foreign rice each increased by an unequal rate of one to one and a half yuan.</p>
<p>Although more than 1,000 bags of glutinous rice continued to arrive, due to seasonal factors, demand was particularly keen, so the selling price stepped up by about one yuan. Jinli special yuan has opened at 45 yuan to 44.5 yuan, Chang Danbai yuan at 43 yuan, medium grade at 41 yuan, and Jiangbei goods are also sold at 41 yuan to 40 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply of thick and thin粳 rice continues unabated. In recent days, the off-market trading outside the market has been sluggish. Due to the general high-quality goods, the market has been very expensive, and those who handle goods also feel that it is difficult to start, so the market situation is desolate and unremarkable. Wuxi Zhente Qingjing rice is still 51 or 52 yuan, and Fenjing rice is about 50 yuan. Other goods are similar.</p>
<p>The arrival of foreign rice in Shanghai was once interrupted, but recently it has been coming continuously. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Guangdong wheel brought 4,946 bags from Hong Kong, which arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the day before yesterday (22nd) and started unloading yesterday morning. In addition, the company's Nanning wheel arrived yesterday afternoon, also carrying 2,400 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong. The Italian wheel Contilachai (transliteration), which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, in addition to transporting a large batch of 7,480 pieces of cotton from Calcutta, also carried 4,991 bags of corn from Saigon, which is said to be handled by the local Daifu Foreign Company and will be transferred to North China within days.</p>
<p>In the Wuxi rice market, in recent days, rice boats from all production areas have been arriving one after another. Due to the increasingly hot weather, the storehouse lenders have a strong desire to sell. Purchasers dare not enter too much. The sales volume of the company's door is limited, people's hearts are weak, and it has fallen back by one or two yuan. High-quality Fenbai粳 rice is 31 yuan per shih, high-quality rough粳 rice is 29 yuan, high-quality粳 rice is 14 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen per dan, and other miscellaneous grains have also fallen by two or three yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Inland Flour Rises by One Jiao <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The flour market is slightly firm, because the retail transactions in this street are gradually active, and the price of rice is prosperous, and people's hearts are slightly improved. The disc price of the No. 2 flour mill is uniformly fixed at the original price of 13 yuan 8 jiao. The return goods of the old car have no transaction. The price of inland flour has also risen due to the reported increase in the Wuxi production area. Generally, the production in the area is limited. Once transported to Shanghai for sale, the local area is found to be in short supply. Therefore, the cargo side, after hearing the news, wants to wait and see and is unwilling to easily release the goods. As a result, the price of Shunfeng brand, etc., has risen from 13 yuan 3 jiao and a half to 4 jiao and a half, an increase of 1 jiao compared with the previous time. The total transaction volume is 5,000 to 6,000 bags. At the moment when the new wheat has not yet been released, there will be no major changes in the market. On the 24th, 3,000 bags of flour were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wuxi flour has been transported in recent days, the stock bottom is thin, and the market price has been revived. The price of flour on the day before yesterday rose from 12 yuan 7 or 8 jiao per bag to 13 yuan 2 or 3 jiao.</p>

<p>Hai Ning cocoon price, improved species opened yesterday to 280 yuan, the highest price of local species is 240 yuan, which is very expensive, and there is a world of difference compared with previous years. The cocoon lines in the Hangjia area are all in the hands of "Central China". Occasionally, there are merchants operating, but they must also obtain the consent of others. In addition, "Central China" feels that the cocoon price is too high and the profit is not abundant, so it intends to force down the cocoon price. Formal merchants cannot operate freely, and silkworm farmers cannot sell at a good price. All mulberry areas are complaining.</p>
<p>New York's silk market yesterday rose by 3.5 points in the near term and 6.5 points in the long term. Yokohama spot has no ups and downs, and the long term rose by 12 yuan, so the local silk market is relatively lively. Foreign firms are entering the market. Selected Lizheng brand is 2,400 yuan, the second brand is 2,300 yuan, and there are continued transactions. Baichang 7 or 8 points 5,050 yuan original price, ordinary B word price is 4,950 yuan. Jardine Matheson, Credit Lyonnais, Dachan, and Renji all have entered the market, and there are those who sell to the United States for the remaining price, which is calculated at 2.20 yuan per pound of raw silk, which is equivalent to more than 5,300 yuan of legal currency in yesterday's market.

<h3 id="e107">Cao Shaoyuan Travels Thousands of Miles to Find His Father <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Cao Shaoyuan of Changli County is cautious, sincere, and honest. His father went outside Shanhaiguan to do business, and there was no news of him for many years. Cao Shaoyuan served his grandparents and mother with utmost filial piety. Every time he thought of his father, he would weep and lose sleep and appetite. Whenever someone came from outside the pass, he would repeatedly inquire about him, and repeatedly wanted to go find him himself. His grandparents initially pitied his youth and weakness and strongly dissuaded him. In the twenty-seventh year of Daoguang, Cao Shaoyuan was already strong and determined to find his father. He set off in August of that year. In January of the following year, he arrived at Sanxing and learned that his father was in the Russian country of Gangzhadega, commonly known as Wuzhijiang, more than 8,000 miles away from Sanxing. The area was densely forested and impassable by land. He followed the river by boat to the extremely cold northern part, where the river ice was tens of feet thick and only thawed in June. The locals used dogs to pull wood, dragging it on the ice like an ice bed in the interior, eating raw fish and wearing fish skin for clothing. When tired, they would lie on the ice bed or on the ice. Cao Shaoyuan endured hardship and finally arrived there in late April. In May, he found his father, who had been unable to walk for three years due to his plight. He wept and carried his father on his back to return home. At the end of the year, he arrived home, after seventeen months, traveling more than 20,000 miles back and forth. Everyone who heard about it praised him. Now, his grandparents are both deceased, and Cao Shaoyuan's hair is also gray. He earns a living by collecting firewood and is content with poverty. The magistrate of Lichang County personally went to inquire and provided him with millet every month to support him. Li Hongzhang, because he had not heard the teachings of poetry and books but was able to travel thousands of miles to find his father, specially requested that he be honored.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Responding to the "Daylight Saving" Movement <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi Zhi</p>
<p>The "Daylight Saving" movement recently launched by the Shanghai Municipal Council will be implemented from June 1st. This is worth promoting and is a meaningful movement that should be unanimously supported and earnestly implemented by the citizens of the isolated island today!</p>
<p>We know that after the "August 13th" bombardment, everything in Shanghai has been too abnormal. Looking at the people of all classes living in such an environment, they also lack good guidance and improvement. Their actions show a deformed reaction. For example, reveling in the song and dance stages at night and still snoring in the sun, and many other unreasonable behaviors, in a larger sense, reduce the efficiency of people's work; from a small perspective, it also hinders the individual's physical and mental health, and also increases the burden of another expenditure under the high tide of life.</p>
<p>Therefore, for the "Daylight Saving" movement promoted by the Municipal Council, all compatriots in the city, whether for private or public considerations, must unanimously respond, promote, and implement it. First, start by improving your physical and mental habits, develop good habits of getting up early and going to bed early, and after finishing work early in the afternoon, take this opportunity to do some indoor exercise, take a walk outside, in order to restore the tired body and mind all day, and at the same time get more time to read books, read newspapers, and other beneficial pastimes, etc. I hope everyone will resolutely and sincerely implement it thoroughly!</p>

<h3 id="e110">Final Warning <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Tian</p>
<p>Merchants who use foreign exchange as a "shield" have finally nakedly presented their ugly faces in front of every citizen, without any way to escape. However, the duck that is used to eating snails still has its last skill—hiding in the shed and making no sound, which is what is commonly called "making a fortune in silence." If foreign exchange is kept for a long time and not sold, and the increased prices are not reduced, what can you do?</p>
<p>It is naturally more than enough to deal with the city's citizens with this "tough" method, because in addition to shouting and anger, the citizens can only watch it hide in the shed and carefully chew the aftertaste of the snail, which does nothing to fill their empty stomachs. However, having lost the excuse of the "shield," there will eventually be a day when things are "handled according to the law." The Municipal Council has decided to file a public lawsuit against twenty speculative rice merchants in the middle of next week, and that is definitely not a joke.</p>
<p>In the past, the authorities admitted that they had failed in their work to suppress prices, precisely because the "shield" was hung high in front. They pretended to be legitimate merchants who were "seeking profit from their capital," and it was impossible to see their true faces through the shield. On the contrary, they even demanded "protection." Therefore, the authorities repeatedly stated that they would require citizens to assist them. If they discovered any instances of deliberately raising prices, they should report them immediately so that they could investigate thoroughly. This was a passive way to break through the "shield" individually. Some people thought that this was the authorities' perfunctory shirking of responsibility. I think that the difficulties of the officials should be forgiven. Now that the奸商 has revealed their true colors, won't the authorities immediately punish them severely?</p>
<p>However, judging from the situation, punishing one is perhaps not enough to warn a hundred for those who embrace the "make a fortune in silence" doctrine. All citizens should take advantage of this opportunity to work together. No matter how small the amount, even a jiao or a fen, if anyone is found to be deliberately raising prices, they should be reported immediately. When the authorities are determined to implement legal sanctions, they should ensure that those ducks who are used to eating snails are unable to wait quietly for digestion and are choked to death. That would be truly gratifying.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to give a final warning to the ducks who have broken the "shield": now is the time to consider what "good strategies" you should use to cope with the coming of your doomsday.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Elementary School Textbooks Are Indeed Being Downsized <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Naxun</p>
<p>According to a friend of mine who works at a certain large cultural institution, due to the rising cost of raw materials, their company is planning to downsize the elementary school textbooks, and he is currently in charge of this work.</p>
<p>They are not only downsizing them but also re-cutting and pasting them, removing the illustrations and arranging each line and each row tightly without leaving any space. The top and bottom margins have also been shortened a lot. However, according to the budget, there may still be a need to raise prices slightly.</p>
<p>Of course, on the bookseller's side, there may be reasons for such actions, and they may say that they are doing this to reduce the burden on students' parents.</p>
<p>However, this is actually increasing the burden on the students: because illustrations can not only arouse the reader's interest but also allow them to follow the clues and develop observation skills and strengthen reasoning. As for the sparse arrangement of rows and columns, this can reduce eye strain and prevent students from feeling bored and dull. Only the top and bottom margins seem to have no great use. If anything, they are only a matter of "beauty or ugliness," and now they are being treated equally.</p>
<p>I feel that at a time when schools across the country are unable to purchase instruments and real teaching aids, textbooks should not only not reduce illustrations but should also increase them. Perhaps this is what their trade association has discussed and decided to do. They certainly have their own grievances. However, I still hope that they can pay attention to the efficiency of education.</p>
<p>I hope everyone will pay serious attention to this matter. In any case, elementary school textbooks cannot be made like this, but simply downsizing them would be fine. Moreover, I also hope that they will not be priced higher!</p>

<p>Chapter 24: Lake and Mountain Purged, Each with its Merit; Scholars and Ladies Rejoice, Shouting "Long Live!"</p>
<p>Wei Ai-ren thought: This matter must be discussed with Jin Danyu; I need her help. It would be best if, on Double Tenth Day (October 10th), we could have the same group of people come to Freedom Village and have a lively celebration. She came up with an idea: Mrs. Su Liya donated so much money to the Freedom Village Library. On that day, we should invite her to unveil it. Jin Danyu should be told about this beforehand, otherwise, Mrs. Su Liya will be very busy with banquets on National Day. A trip to the countryside will allow her to decline various banquets. Secondly, the location for the two He sisters' factory has been decided, and the construction of the building is urgent. The design is already with engineer Lin Jiancheng. We should ask Danyu's brother-in-law to urge him to complete the factory design within a few days. We should also discuss with the He sisters about holding a groundbreaking ceremony at the factory site in Freedom Village on Double Tenth Day. Wouldn't that be great? On the day of the groundbreaking ceremony, we can invite many sisters to come, and I will also invite old Dr. ____ to Freedom Village. Zhu Ai-ren's plan was solely to please her grandfather. After discussing it with Jin Danyu, Jin Danyu readily agreed, saying that the construction design was no problem, and she could supervise him. Moreover, there is already a construction company available, and because materials are readily available, construction will be fast. However, she doesn't know if Mrs. Su Liya has any prior engagements that day. If she has no other appointments, she can accompany her. As for herself, she is always extremely busy on National Day because she has to entertain foreign guests. This year, she happens to be on vacation, so she can definitely come. Zhu Ai-ren thought: If Engineer Lin comes, and Mrs. Su Liya comes, you won't dare not come. With that settled, on Double Tenth Day, many sisters will be able to come. That day, after having dinner in Freedom Village, they sent Zhu Ai-ren back to Anlezhen Hospital. Then, the family vehicle returned to Shanghai, arriving at around eleven o'clock at night. The two He sisters had various preparations to make for opening the silk weaving factory. They needed to contact Jiang Jingrong regarding economic and equipment matters, and Lin Jiancheng regarding design and construction matters. Therefore, they also had at least a two-week delay in Shanghai. They weren't lonely in Shanghai, there were many sisters, and Jin Danyu and the others were also planning a second car test drive. This second test drive was originally planned for Saturday, and they also wanted to invite Wu Junsu to go together. Unexpectedly, the weather was bad, and it started to rain. This rain started in the middle of the night when they returned from Freedom Village and continued until Saturday without stopping. (285)</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Theatrical Tide in the Provisional Capital (Part 1) <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Ying</p>
<p>The Chongqing Drama Festival</p>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) This year, April in Chongqing is not only the month of women (because the three Madams, two Queens, and eight female Senators (the entire group), and anti-aggression writer Agnes Smedley, etc., came to Chongqing in April), but also because the theatrical tide on the Chongqing stage is surging, it can also be said to be the month of drama. Four "major productions" were staged in Chongqing in April, which aroused enthusiastic responses from the broad audience. It is even more noteworthy that two of the scripts were made into grand gifts to entertain distinguished guests who came to Chongqing, thus enriching the content of the so-called "theatre month" and making them more active and more meaningful.</p>
<p>The National Academy of Drama's touring performance in Chongqing was the driving force behind this theatrical tide. They brought a total of three "major productions," adding a lot of luster to the provisional capital in April, which is also worth mentioning.</p>
<p>Now, I will report on these four scripts one by one in the order of their performance to the drama fans in the isolated island:</p>
<h3 id="e114">The First Sound of "Yue Fei" <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The first sound of the National Academy of Drama's performance on the Chongqing stage was the historical drama "Yue Fei" in ancient costume. This is a four-act play, written by Gu Yiqiao and directed by Yang Cunbin. It was performed at the Guotai Grand Theatre from April 1st to April 5th in the morning, a total of nine performances.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the performance of "Yue Fei" cannot be overpraised for its success, but it is not considered a failure either. In terms of the content of the script, it is not active enough and is slightly detached from reality, which is undeniable, but in the epilogue, the writer emphasized it, and the whole play was relatively free of loopholes. In terms of the performers, all the actors were quite dedicated, and their skills were also good. "Yue Fei" is a major production, and if efforts are not made in this area, the performance of "Yue Fei" is extremely dangerous. However, the fact shows that the audience after watching the performance was very satisfied with it, and every show was packed for four days.</p>
<p>At this time, the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union happened to be gathered in the provisional capital, which was a rare opportunity. Therefore, the National Diplomacy Association assumed its mission of promoting friendly relations and used the ancient costume "Yue Fei" to reserve all the seats for the last performance on the morning of April 5th, completing the two major tasks of entertaining the four ambassadors and promoting the national spirit. At that time, the four ambassadors and their wives and foreign guests in Chongqing all happily attended. Even important figures in the National Government, such as Sun Ke, Feng Yuxiang, Shao Lizi, and Kong Xiangxi, also participated, and the number of people exceeded the original plan. Many ladies of the VIPs even stood and watched the entire performance. On this day, the cameras were even more active, leaving many precious shots for permanent memory.</p>
<p>Finally, everyone happily returned in the majestic sound of "Man Jiang Hong."</p>
<h3 id="e115">Xia Xia, Lan Lan, etc., Win Drama Medals; Wang Yachen's Chinese Paintings Sold at High Prices for Charity <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Qiushui</p>
<p>The "International Charity Performance" hosted by the wives of the British and French ambassadors was held at the Lafayette Theatre at 9 p.m. on the 22nd. That night, Lafayette was full of the national flags of China, Britain, and France, and the atmosphere was very solemn. Small-sized Chinese paintings and explanatory notes in English and French were also displayed in the corridor and sold for five or ten yuan as donations. Young ladies of three nationalities carried donation bags made of the French national emblem and peddled paintings and explanatory notes to the noble guests wearing evening dresses.</p>
<p>The award ceremony was held after the first act. First, Police Superintendent Hibbard gave a speech, announcing that Xia Xia, Lan Lan, Bo Li, Xu Li, and Chi Ning were awarded drama medals. Amidst warm applause, the five artists smiled and accepted the medals before returning backstage.</p>
<p>Before the second act, four Chinese paintings donated by Wang Yachen were auctioned for charity. The auction format caused the paintings to gradually increase in value through competition. The first painting was auctioned off for 150 yuan, the second for 190 yuan, the third for 300 yuan, and the fourth for 210 yuan. Before the fourth painting, six flower baskets presented by the Sino-French Friendship Association to the actresses of "Wu Zetian" were displayed in front of the curtain.</p>
<p>A grand event rarely encountered in the theater world passed in a pleasant atmosphere.</p>
<h3 id="e116">"The Three Smiles" Compete Head-to-Head <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>

<p>In recent years, domestically produced films have been popular in ancient costumes, and they all use novels and unofficial histories as the subject matter for screenwriting. Therefore, various companies often unintentionally take the same story. However, there has never been a precedent for actually starting filming at the same time and causing a double-packaging case. This time, Yi Hua and Guo Hua's "The Three Smiles" may break the precedent.</p>
<p>Yi Hua's "The Three Smiles" has already started filming, directed by Yue ____, starring Li Lihua, Yan Hua, Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, etc. Guo Hua has decided to start soon, starring Zhou Xuan, Xu Feng, and You Guangzhao. Liu Zhonghao, the owner of Guo Hua, said: Our company had already planned to film this movie, and if the two companies have to compete head-to-head, then there is no other way.</p>
<p>Since the publication of Fu's new chess endgame manual, sales have been quite brisk. To give preferential treatment to fellow enthusiasts, there is a 20% discount on the list price, and a special edition will be presented with the book, but only for ten days. If you answer the endgame problems, there is still hope of winning a prize. Address: No. 41, Lane 413, Connaught Road.</p>
