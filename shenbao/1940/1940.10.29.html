<p>社評</p>
<h3>義國進侵希的前瞻</h3>
<p>即在一星期之前，本報指陳國際最近動態，以為目前在演化為世界戰爭的前夕，希臘是問題的國家之一。一星期來德義方面所作政治的外交種種攻勢，乃至所傳的和平攻勢，本報亦旣揭穿之為企圖擴大戰爭的又一面。不幸的事實緊緊跟着觀察而實現了：昨晚消息，義大利於昨晨三時，向希臘提出最後通牒之後，晨六時，即將軍隊開入了希臘境內。到記者握管時為止，知道德國元首希特勒昨又往晤義國首相墨索里尼，必然又有何種繼往開來而極堪注意的新策動：與義國進兵希臘後的一切，必然有密切關係；但希臘與土耳其以及巴爾幹半島其他方面對於義國的發動侵希，怎樣反應？所牽涉的全局，怎樣開展？尙無續報。但綜觀前因後果，若非義國侵希的消息根本不確，若非義軍入希後忽又廢然而返，則無論希臘抗戰與吾，勝敗如何，總之，歐戰擴大到巴爾幹了，歐洲最大的火藥庫爆發了。</p>
<p>從義國的侵犯希臘，極簡單而顯明的證實了德義征服欲念的廣大，宰制全局的決非紙上空談：吾則，像希臘這樣的一個國家、，旣不會與德義爭雄，亦不為德義心腹之患，何以竟不免於德義的操刀？若說：德義所敵對的還是祗有英國，為粉碎英國計，為剷除英國在地中海與近東的根據計，始不得不假道希臘；侵希，不為滅希而為對英，這種撞倒了路人來趕路的解釋，當然沒有人能信服的。因此，撇開了英德兩國有關的種種而不論，世界輿情必為希臘被侵而寄予無限同情。</p>
<p>希臘是歐洲東南角的小國，在巴爾幹半島的南端，佔了大陸的一角，合無數島嶼而立國：領土不過十三萬方公里，人口不足七百萬：却是歐洲文明的最早策源地，經歷了無數的興衰存亡之局；最近一時代的獨立，祗有一百多年却又經歷了不少决數的國際戰爭。人民文化程度相當之高，至少在巴爾幹半島可算首屈一指，大多從農從商；境內並沒什麼豐富的蘊藏，決非侵略者心目中的大魚肥肉，不夠做侵略軍事的重要資源；祗有所產大理石，可做墳墓上的貴重點綴品，這當然不是略取的本旨吧！北接保加利亞與南斯拉夫兩國，以及義大利所征服了的阿爾巴尼亞；這决義軍侵入，即是取徑於阿邦，故阿邦滅亡的時候，希臘已有脣亡齒寒之感了；西南兩面伸入地中海，西對義大利而南對非洲埃及與義屬利比亞：東抱愛琴海，與土耳其為鄰。假令德義志在東征，則希臘障庇了地中海的東部三分之一，實係首當其衝；但是絕對沒有德義東征非先征希臘不可的理由；地中海面多遼闊啊！</p>
<p>從希臘近年政治外交的動嚮，推測其今日被侵略的反應，必然的，出於全力抗戰，他與土耳其有密切的關係，與英國有互助的成的；申言之，他在平時、與國際是多方面的；在被侵略而作戰時，英土是他最所仰望的與國。事到如今，英國對希，不問其為政治的理由，條的的義務，軍略的見地，在希臘抗戰的前提之下，必然的，予以全力援助。蓋希臘陸軍實力的水準不很低。甚堪一戰；空軍海軍遠不如義大利，但海空根據地的設備，非惟不容藐視，且多貼封了義國。今若因與英國駢肩作戰而將海空根據地儘量供給英國利用，則對於英國在地中海與近東作戰軍事上，實有莫大價値，莫大裨補。英國援希，當然在很早的且有效的計劃之中，而與往日的援助波蘭挪威絕不相侔；但這决赴援能吾悉中機宜，則因英國方竭全力應付德國對英倫三島的閃電戰略之後，援希實效能吾悉如原定計劃，不能作無保留的論斷。至於土耳其，本報亦嘗於五日之前，申述其對於歐戰向背關係的影響遠大，而為大局中問題的國家中之又一國。五六日前，這是微妙之謎；現在，希臘被侵了，戰爭火燄蔓延及於巴爾幹半島而觸發此最大火藥庫了；土耳其可以視為被逼至必須立即決定其態度的時機；已不復為微妙之謎而為決斷關頭了！</p>

<h3>男女婚姻指導</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師撰</p>
<p>求幸福配偶的秘訣</p>
<p>婚姻問題，是人生的最耍問題；並且，在新舊思想衝突和交遞的時代中，這婚姻問題更成了複雜的嚴重的，而是靑年迫切地要解決的問題。靑年們時常在喊着苦悶，煩惱，這原因雖各不同，但恐怕有不少是繫於婚姻問題的不得圓滿解決。啟示婚姻的動機者，由於戀愛所致，然此戀愛的動力，惟「美」而已。所以也可說擇耦的第一條是「美」。但一提到「美」便很容易使人想到外貌上去，而且一般人的常情，確也常以「容貌」美來作擇耦的標準，這實在是錯悞的，美應注重在生殖本能上的，纔能幸福無窮。</p>
<p>吾人不求婚姻的幸福則巳，若欲享此幸福，則必須保衛此幸福源泉的生殖機能，第一男子在婚前必須守貞，自凟亦應速戒，若果祗圖目前，則早洩，陰萎，生殖不能，神經衰弱等症由是而生，從此卽不能與妻充分協調，甜蜜的夢就此難圓了。現在醫學進步，對於本症己發明雄壯動物睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」服後保証腦力淸爽，精神振作，面色紅潤，食慾增進，性機能非常健全，絕無早洩，陰痿病態，且能促進生殖機能，幫助性器發育，該劑已被無數中外醫家所推崇，樂為介紹於愛情淡薄的伉儷們。故欲挽救不良的婚姻結合，惟有增進「補體康」方能賜予，其女用者，尙有調經種子，解除不感症之功。</p>
<h3>少壯時代不宜遺精</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>俗云：「少壯不努力，老大徒悲傷。」由此衡之，則吾人欲謀終身的幸福，應在靑春之時加以努力，然而今之靑年，往往未老先凋，此無他，大半由於性慾過度，染上自凌，致遺精頻繫，腎氣虧耗之故耳。精液一物，除繁衍種族而外，又足以以保持神經之興奮，故出精以後疲勞殊甚者，卽保持興奮力養分減少也。遺精之人，此種養分，愈見減少，神經卽現　弱之象。其普通之證狀如失眠，頭重，頭昏，記憶力減退，心悸怔忡，食慾不振等，久之遂使肌肉削瘦，生命短促矣。</p>
<p>但雖因自責過度，致爆發了遺精，然能及早知害戒絕，則可避免一切幣害。行局部冷水摩擦，照以德國出品「耐而斯遺精片」，即可將遺精制止，而「耐而斯遺精片」尚有鎮靜腦神經之功，患失眠健忘者福之，頗有奇效。</p>

<h3>美籍著名商人返滬　談美國積極援英　欲求自衛當先援助英國　本届大選羅氏必可連任</h3>
<p>本埠美籍某著名商人美國烟公司經理某氏、二十三日乘柯立芝總統號郵船由美抵滬、渠對美總統羅斯福之領袖才能、備極推崇、咋曾向記者宣稱、美國目下不啻已置身於歐洲之戰爭中、美國已將一切戰爭需用品、盡量運往英國、美國人民百分之九十、均贊同羅斯福總統以舊式驅逐艦五十艘運交英國、以換取更多根據地、充美國海軍之用、對於此舉、並無人加以指摘、</p>
<p>援助英國　不啻自助</p>
<p>某氏深信、若　皇家空軍需要一飛行堡壘」者、可立卽獲得之、美人深知美國及全世界之命運、似繫於歐戰之最後結局、故彼等現正要求對英國予以除參　以外一切可能之援助、某氏曾歷訪美國國內最大之城市十五處、見各處人民均團結一致、保衛本國、渠　晤談之美人、均覺英倫三島卽為美國之第一防綫、在紐的及沿大西洋海岸之人民、主張援助英國、更為堅決、蓋彼　深知萬一美國海岸遭受攻擊、則彼等將為最先受敵者、</p>
<p>羅斯福氏　決可連任</p>
<p>下月五日、美國人民將參加投票、選舉羅斯福總統連任、某氏有多數友人雖屬威爾基一派、但彼等勸渠為羅斯福「打賭」、因彼等亦深信羅斯福將繼續仟白宮之主人也、國內大多數投票人巳決計選舉羅斯福連任、蓋在此危急之時機、對於領導國家大事者與其另舉新人、不如舉一駕輕就熟之斵輪老手為佳也、威爾基之對外政策與羅斯福不謀而合、故威氏之競選運動、現正着重於內政方面、但目下美國人民心月中、均以對外政策為當務之急、內政問題、暫時可置之腦後、</p>
<p>威爾基氏　難獲勝利</p>
<p>依渠之見解、目下美國　紙雖於封面上大載威氏之競選演詞、但威氏之競選運動、恐小能獲致勝利、威氏承認彼並不反對現政府之政策、但彼且以為能領導此項政策更勝於羅氏、威氏確為一成功之商人、但美國人民不信成功之商人卽為優良之政治家、某氏稱、美國因偉大國防計劃、正在進行之故、國內商業頗有蓬勃之象、失業人數亦大見减少、技術工藝、甚為需要美國現正訓練大批人才、以備担任各軍火工廠內之耍職、</p>
<p>美僑婦女　選舉總統</p>
<p>昨據本埠美國大學婦女協會聲稱、該會會員，將於本國開始選舉總統前一星期在滬投票選舉、該會每月常會一决、下决則在本月卅一日（星期四）下午四時舉行、屆時選舉總統當為大會節目之一部份、此外大會又擬討論獎學金事、此獎金於秋季結束前贈予美童公學之一高級女生故請各會員踴躍輸將籌集成數以資獎學、聞本埠美僑婦女、將大多赴會云、</p>
<h3>近效臾軍抽赴前綫　泰半枉死　千餘名僅剩數百</h3>

<h3>美商會等公團　宴迎新領　並錢前代領返國</h3>
<p>美駐滬新總領事洛克赫德、於本月二十三日乘美國總統輪公司柯立芝總統輪抵滬後、已於二十四日晨九時在江西路領事署舉行就職禮、原任代領波德立克領事、以滬領館職務、負責有人、所有案卷均巳移交淸楚、業定十一月一日乘批亞士總統輪離滬返國、另膺新職、本埠美國協會與美國商會、為歡迎新領來滬就職、並餞別代領、以示惜別起見、爰定本週四（三十一日）假美國協會設宴公　、屆時車水馬龍、必有一番盛况、</p>
<p>雜視遠東瞬將開幕的　新新美髮廳先睹紀　斥資十餘萬華麗高貴允推上海獨步　利用科學威力機械設備　美髮權威　遊記者</p>
<p>（特寫）一九四〇冬天，上海又一雄視遠東的新事業將再度興奮地激刺上海人士的耳目了，那便是遠東第一座理髮之宮，新新美髮廳的開幕。</p>
<p>新新美髮廳是新新公司繼新都飯店之後的又一驚人貢獻，它毅然犧牲了旅館部大門口一角廣大的地方，不惜利用設計家的腦汁，將建築在二個月的短促時日裏，賴乎優越而且雄厚的經濟條件，把原有陳舊的新新理髮廳重新改建變了渙然一新的光輝面目。</p>
<p>讓我把參觀所得的印象在這裏作一次簡單的報導，就算它開幕的獻禮。</p>
<p>在形式上的新新美髮廳，全廳分作二層，大門在貴州路，門首有一間「新新式」樣子間，點綴以富麗輝煌的霓虹燈光，這樣子每星期由奧國著名美容技師精心獨創，公開陳列展覽，供上海仕女們參攷研究採用，夏有標準冷氣，冬有溫暖熱風，這是開創上海理髮店服務顧客的先例。</p>
<p>進門，底層完全噴漆乳油色，柔和的燈光從迴光燈中返射出來，能保護在較長時間內休息美容者的目光及身心感覺，地上，「愛儂憐」的橡皮地毡使數十人的聲波全為吸收而寂靜無聲，高尙安靜的樂園正是仕女們赴宴交際前的最良好的準備地點。</p>
<p>二樓，油翡翠的色澤刷新了來賓的眼簾，白衣女神溫馨底笑把你帶上了裝有美國最新華貴的晶體長燈泡電燈的立體理髮宮，多驚人的設備使每一個仕女震憾於機械底用具設備而嘆羨現代科學昌明的權威了。</p>
<p>留有特別風趣的是坐着或臥着的仕女們可以不必移動而和任何人電話暢談，企業家們在理髮時可以照常處決辦公，漂亮的小姐們也可以一邊理髮一邊　管長期間和靑年紳士暢情交際。</p>
<p>於是，第一流的理髮技師被搜羅到來了，不但，重視理髮廳的公司當局們更嚴格地提出該事先舉行三星期特別訓練的辦法，因此，由於奧國美容專家的服務精神入技術的訓練後，它們不再是普通甚至在中國可以找尋得到的「白衣使者」了。</p>
<p>尤其重要的則是一個英勇偉大的不朽嘗試，新新美髮廳特化鉅額美金和美國紐約訂定其最新發明的冷氣暖風自動保險電　機的遠東獨家享用專用＋，這機件是美國最新發明遠東嘗次採用，冬暖夏凉，科學奇蹟，而且自動保險絕對安全。</p>
<p>在理髮廳的服務中，還有一件値得介紹的，是對於衛生消毒的注意，它不但專用二位小姐專司用具的消毒，而且每人可登記特用毛巾編號消毒保存，假如每天以十二小時工作計算，每小時美髮卅二人，一天需用毛巾三百八十四條，每月需用毛巾一萬一千五百二十條，倘以每條一元計算，新新美髮廳每月爲服務顧客犧牲的毛巾數達一萬餘元，其餘甚至梳具凡經顧客用過卽行消毒工作另用紙袋包好以示分別，也就可知新新美髮廳豪華高貴一斑了。</p>

<p>日軍力量單薄</p>
<p>距紹與縣城卅華里之柯橋、亦被小股日軍竄入、盤踞於柯岩一帶、故當地情形、已呈混亂、惟流竄紹興境內日軍、兵力異常蓮弱、其被殲滅，指顧可期、據本埠熟悉浙紹地勢者觀察、日軍此次能攻入紹城、全賴其機械部隊、因紹興以北地勢均極平坦、今春日軍亦曾一度竄抵近郊、不旋踵而敗退蕭山、惟紹興以南、則地勢高　、叢山峻嶺、而且民情强悍、勇於作戰、日軍決難繼續南進、日軍此次南犯目的、僅在牽制浙東華軍兵力母須加以重視、</p>

<p>捷克僑民協會、昨發出一沉痛宣言云、「今日十五億捷克人紀念其獨立一十二周、捷克亡國三百年後、至一九一八年、始恢復其獨立自由、惟新捷克共和國僅生存甚暫之二十年、在此甚暫之壽命中、捷克實為歐洲最發達最民主最有政治信仰自由之國家、隨後希特勒之勢力到來、乃造成捷克史上最黑暗之時代、一九三八年慕尼黑協定摧殘興盛之捷克、一九三丸年三月、國社黨竟違反諾言、侵略與佔領捷克殘餘領土、而捷克遂吿倫亡、隨之而來者、卽為屈辱高壓刧掠與殘殺時代、今日十五億捷克人民、共同慶祝其國慶、彼居於捷克故土之人、在國社黨及秘密警察壓迫下、不准開會紀念、祇能在其內心紀念此節日、去年此日、曾有幾百學生被殺、幾百遭受非刑、及幾千被關人集中營、因為渠等曾紀念國慶、為此、所有捷克大學及其他高級學校、被國社黨勒令停辦三年、但國社黨方面之恐怖行動、決不能遏止捷克人禱祝協的國勝利及其祖國解放、居於國外五億之捷克備民、將以隆重典禮紀念此日、渠等同情其國內受壓迫而同時力求捷克複興之同胞、而捷克軍亦懷此志願在心、與協的國及其他反抗國社黨之軍隊、駢肩作戰」、</p>
<h3>美運艦金星號　昨駛上海　稍留即赴華北</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美海軍亞洲艦隊供應艦金星號、今日（二十八日）淸晨從瓜姆島駛抵上海、此間美海軍軍官聲稱、該艦來滬、純係循例之行、外傳該艦將載送本市美海軍入員之眷屬一說、實屬不確、金星號將在滬留泊數日、然後或將駛往華北、惟航期尙未決定、</p>
<h3>法輪駛滬防綫　開始搭客</h3>
<p>法國郵船公司新近加入滬防間航行之郵船大達南號、將於本週三（三十日）下午一時、由馬尼刺西貢等處駛來上海、輪泊董煙自碼頭、在滬留泊開，、定於本週五絕早、暹跋日本神戶、由神戶直駛小呂宋、然後再來滬（香港來回均不兼瀾）回返防　、嗣後賅輪卽行駛新航綫、公司方面業巳開始售票載貨、又金第亞輪準於明日駛往越南各口岸、</p>
<h3>白俄慮日方報復　徬徨恐懼　擬另組委員會　反遭日方拒絕</h3>
<p>昨日聞諸可靠方面、上星期曾有自稱為白俄僑民代表者數人向日方申請、要求組織另一獨立之白俄委員會、直轄於「　府」之下、據悉、此項申請，巳由日軍特務部枇不不准、查本埠白俄僑民、係於俄國發生革命後避難來滬者、共可有六千餘入、向由白俄僑民委員會管轄、在過去數年中、已故之前委員會主席梅滋勒（係被剌殞命者）　於此輩白俄僑民、曾予以不少幫助、當三年前、中國政府在南京時、對於此輩俄僑、並未加以承認、據可靠方面稱、此次白俄僑民若干代表申請組織另一委員會之動機、乃因恐遭日方之報復、一如在哈爾濱天津先後所遭遇之同棣命運、此項請求、雖巳經日方批駁、據悉、此輩俄僑或將作再度之申請、</p>
<h3>全國慰勞總會頒滬　慰勞金捐獻辦法　捐款匯出另須備函說明　捐款性質指定若何用途</h3>
<p>全國慰勞總會以自抗戰以還、國內外同胞、慷慨解囊、踴躍捐輸、惟對於捐款擺寄手續、尙嫌簡略、以致辦理上殊感困難、如捐款由銀行滙出、旣未註明慰勞捐款、亦未說明是個人捐獻或團體徵募、致令該會無法列賬、往往多方查詢、耗費時日、經釐訂糾正辦法、以便稽攷、而利事功、滬市各界現已奉到該項辦法如下、（一）捐款從銀行滙出時、務請另行來函說明、（二）來函內請說朋捐款性質及是吾指定用途、（三）款項係個人捐獻或團體捐獻、或徵募所得、亦請在函內說明、（四）捐款收據如須分別發給、務請附一捐款者詳細名單、（五）如指定交前方某人者、亦請詳細說明、</p>
<h3>日艦扣輪　恣意非法搜檢　登輪後卽停止無綫電訊　往來各處持槍恫嚇旅客</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、怡和洋行明生號輪、從香港來滬、在上海港海以南的五六百哩處被日方驅逐艦一艘所阻、致延遲一天、昨（二十七日）始抵此、該輪旅客頃叙述日海軍士兵持槍恣意往來全輪之情形、歷歷如繪、</p>
<p>行動突兀　一無結果</p>
<p>日海軍擱船搜查、鮮見不鮮、明生輪被阻、僅其一例耳、惟日方攔阻該輪、在某數方面、似頗突兀、而搜查一無結果、徒使該輪不得按期於星期六晚抵此而已、</p>
<p>開砲勒停　登輪搜檢</p>
<p>據旅客所述、星期五午後六時許、明生輪正前駛中、忽有日驅逐艦一艘駛近、發彈一響、勒令明生輪停下、再發閃光信號、然後派官兵的十二人、乘艇登輪、立卽動手、使明生輪無綫電機不能使用、致該輪不得與岸上或他船通報、</p>
<p>槍嚇旅客　隨意取物</p>
<p>日兵繼卽持手槍、往來全輪、恫嚇旅客、順手取物檢視、多無一定目的、率領日兵之官佐要求明生輪長准其盤詰全體華籍旅客、雖遭拒絕、仍强自向一二華人詰問、日兵並搜查一二房艙、漫無目的、即日兵搜索全船亦無明顯目標、且一無結果、</p>
<p>前後騷擾　一小時餘</p>
<p>聞日兵對於某數點、如欲入海圖定等、與該輪高級船員發生爭論、船員雖不加抗拒、惟堅請日兵須循例行手續進行、日海軍官兵騷擾一小時餘始離、而准明生號賡續前駛、</p>
<h3>赴香港旅客　須領防疫證</h3>
<p>本埠太古輪船公司華人船務部通吿旅客云、「啟者、現香港政府通令香港旅客、必須在英工部局或法工部局衛生處注射防疫針及種牛痘領取證明書、幷需照片貼上、方准許上岸、但在江海關檢疫處領取證明書、則不必照片、此佈、」</p>
<h3>商業銀行活布減息　並非公會議決　會員銀行劃頭減息一厘　不能作爲存款减息根據　四行等儲蓄存款息特予提高</h3>
<p>中中交農四行奉部令吸收游資、推行儲蓄、使游資入正軌得為國用、並為養成儉樸風氣、及善良習慣、普遍設立簡易儲蓄處、規定吸收儲款之利率、以活期週息五厘、定期一年週息一分為原則、並得參照地方情形、酌量增减之、不受一般儲蓄條例之限制、一切設備、力求簡單、各項開支、務須撙節、手續力求簡便、除特別注意吸收小額存款外、並推行節的建國儲金、及儲蓄券有獎儲蓄等、</p>
<p>减息不能　减少危機</p>
<p>自浙江實業·上海·國華·以及大陸·中南·鹽業·金城·等行、先後减低活存利息一厘後、旨在减少利息上之担負、實緣於各商業銀行存款過多、而無法利用之時、减低存息、允於商業銀行有利、例如一千萬元存款减低一厘、則年可節省十萬元利息、然多數銀行認為减低利息、非但不能解決目前之銀行危機、反足影響存戶之心理、使資金流入投機之途、所以各商業銀行之减息、係由各商業銀行自動、並非銀行業同行公會議決、</p>
<p>銀會改息　全係對內</p>
<p>關於上海銀行聯合準備委員會通吿對會員銀行國幣（卽劃頭）存款、自十一月一日起由三厘减低為二厘後、新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、銀行聯合準備會之國幣活存息、在八一三以前、原為一厘半、旋為防止上海資金之逃避、提高為二厘、後又提高為三厘、此决通吿改為二厘、則較戰前尙提高半厘、此全係對會員銀行之辦法、與外間無關、自不得視為上海之普遍减息、同時各銀行不得以該會之改息、作為對存戶减息之根據、並聞各銀行為實行過剩資金內移計劃、巳進行在內地添設分支行處、及籌組銀行團、以便直接投資於內地、對於一部份商業銀行之减息、則不願作何批評、江蘇區丁山局及該局所屬蜀山鎭、湖　鎭代辦所之個人包裹、均應暫停收寄、河北區建橋鎭、旱城各局等包裹及大宗小包郵件、以及寄往油坊鎭局之大宗代收貨價包裹、均應暫停收寄、</p>
<h3>九月底止　金銀出口　均由西南　輸往國外</h3>
<p>海關總稅務司公佈今年一月至九月金銀以及鈔蔡等進出口統計、（一）金進口無、出口由重慶往香港一〇·一三一·一六〇金、（一）銀進口無、出口由蒙自往緬甸一五·二〇五·〇〇〇元、由廣州重慶往香港八九·六四〇元、（三）鈔票進口一五六·〇二八·三四二元、鎳質及銅質輔幣七·六〇四元、港幣一四七·二九五港元、出口鈔票三·〇三八·九四五元、越幣九〇三·三〇〇元、港幣二·一五〇·七五〇淃元、日幣一·五〇〇·〇〇〇日元、英幣一〇·八五〇鎊、美金七五·〇〇〇元、</p>
<h3>滬西日又封鎖　美軍施行戒備　約歷一小時許卽吿撤退　封鎖區居民不勝其痛苦</h3>
<p>駐滬美防軍、於昨日上午九時起、突然在防區內施行特別戒備、派隊在各地巡邏、並在小沙渡路·戈登路·哈同路·愛文義路·等要道口、架設小鋼砲及機關槍、一時形勢甚為緊張、的歷一時許始行撤退、</p>
<p>美軍防區　從事巡邏</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、滬西極司非而路兩衖、今日（二十八日）仍遭日方「封鎖、致衖內許多華籍居民、續受痛苦、同時、駐滬美海軍第四陸戰隊今晨在公共和界西部美軍防區內、採取戒備、而派機關槍隊與巡邏兵數隊、從事巡邏、惟關於今晨美軍之活動、尙無官方消息可得、</p>
<p>兩弄居民　又遭困厄</p>
<p>聞極司非而路被封鎖兩衖內之華籍居民、均須向該區日偽當局購買特別「通行證」、每人兩元、現居民雖瀕絕境、然仍未敢出戶者、殊不乏人、至於日當局對於該區實施封鎖後一星期內、居民巳成餓殍者、究有若干、迄無證實消息、可靠方面傳一週來餓斃之居民、約有八人、</p>

<h3>金融　供求之勢懸絕</h3>
<p>美匯終於六元出關　消息愈趨有利華商掉進法幣</p>
<p>外匯昨日市况、滙豐掛牌悉無上落、英美滙暗市、鬆勢再接再厲、美滙達六元一五六二五、英金將叩四辦士大關、原因為中日間之和平空氣、明知無稽、而仍未消散、歐洲戰事延及希臘、香港忽告緊張、且美國之參戰、已無可避免、華商拋有一百數十萬之鉅、外行吃胃殊弱、祇滙豐稍予維持、然衆寡懸絕、趨勢猛硬、結果晚收英金三辦士九六八七五、美滙六元一五六二五、比上週末收英·美各長一二五及一八七五、</p>
<p>全日塞出美金百萬</p>
<p>晨初以滙兌英對美滬等俱半、美對英不動、對滬長一分、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八四三七五、美滙五元九六八七五、較上週六收、英美兩滙、俱無榮辱、開後賣風卽起、計港電及華商行等一致拋售、滙豐有利曁某美行吃進現美滙由六元、賤至六元零六二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉、各滙勿更、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無增减、此後港電並來賣出本月份先令、計外行吸入價為三辦士八七五、時傳香港形勢告緊、消息利空、投機商猛塞、而外行已無進買、祇滙豐肯進、美滙價已鬆為六元零六二五、午收略平、現貨英金三辦士八九零六二五、美滙六元零三一二五、比晨開英硬零四六八七五、美長零六二五、</p>
<p>英金逼近四辦士關</p>
<p>後市市面愈硬、三井出外行本月份美滙為六元一二五、又華商吸予外行本月份英金長達三辦士九三七五、後投機商售與滙豐麥加利等本月份美滙竟長至六元一二五、及一五六二五、聞投機商吐售之數甚夥、晚收結果英金三辦士九六八七五、美滙六元一五六二五、本下月份與現貨同價、較上星期六收英長一二五、美鬆一八七五、</p>
<p>香港滬美匯價起伏</p>
<p>香港二十八日（週一）電、今晨滙市開盤告平、英滙現貨軟零六二五、為二十三元一二五、申滙現貨降五角、為三百八十五元五角、十時零五分、申滙現貨續降五角、為三百八十五元、十時十五分、申滙現貨再降一元五角、為三百八十三元五角、十一時三十分告平、美滙現貨回硬零六二五、為二十三元一八七五、申滙現貨回升五角、為三百八十四元、十一時五十五分申滙現貨重降一元、為三百八十三元、下午二時三十分告平、申滙現貨續降五分、為三百七十八元、二時五十五分告平、申滙現貨再降一元、為三百七十七元、</p>

<h3>黃金一跌二百餘元　連小四天已跌去四百三十元收盤之後重進五千四百元關</h3>
<p>昨烚赤金市暗盤、跌風愈演愈烈、自五千六百元、而五百元、而四百元、一度破四百之關、終又升至五千四百元、人心奇虛、乃為歐戰擴大、義軍侵希、香港緊張、美國參戰有不可避免等說、外滙劇鬆、現金價隨之狂落、更助長不少跌勢、自晨開卽起賣風、正午證券幫亦來出籠、散戶跟賣、有供無求、會見五千三百八十五元之低價、收盤為五千四百元、較上週　六收軋跌為二百〇五元、現貨當交割價、較期交仍高四五十元、半日交易尙旺、約四千兩、關金等仍平、</p>
<p>晨開外匯趨鬆、人心更疲、在銀號及散戶拋售下、九點半開市、銀號出金號十兩、價已退至五千五百五十元、比上週六午收低五十五元、某金號之力吸、證券幫獲利補空、頓起回風、一哄卅元、金號進銀號數十兩、升至五千五百八十元、時又為某銀號與小錢荘吐售、退至五千五百四十五元、奈現金價在五千六百元外買戶甚殷、金號銀證券幫散戶等紛起收吸、價步升四十五元、證券幫進金號十兩、漲至五千五百九十元、奈外匯步鬆、美金六元〇六二五難賣、金號及銀號小錢荘散戶等紛起力售、及聞現金退至五千六百元內、仍在步降中、市勢更虛、價竟步學瀉九十元、銀號互做十兩、退至五千五百元、午刻散空補進、逐步回升、銀號又互做十兩、午收五千五百廿元、收市後步降至五千五百〇五元、致下午開市、價已退至五千五百元內、某銀號出金號十兩、價為五千四百八十元、壓小廿元、價為五千四百六十元、時某錢荘來進、曾起回風、一哄四十元、另一錢荘出銀號十兩、升至五千五百元關口、奈外匯步鬆不回、證券幫銀號傾向出籠、小錢荘亦不斷吐出、價遂傾向下挫、又悉現金亦退至五千五百元、跌　　號、散戶爭售尤切、價竟步降一百十五元、退入五千四百元內、某銀號出金號十兩、小見五千三百八十五元低價、後有某金號吸進、升上十餘元、進銀號廿兩、四點收市、為五千四百元、比上週六午收狂跌二百〇五元、查已連小四天、共跌四百卅元、當日高低相差、一百九十五元、但收後又跌至五千三百九十五元、但收後又至五千三百九十元左右、現金烚赤做開亦旺、初在五千六百一二十元間、午刻退至五千五百五十元、下午五千四百五十元、高逾期金五十元左右、現金號之本牌金售價、比現烚赤高十數元、收進减三四十元、現摽金無出入、價比牌金低六十元、</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出價、大同行興新同行初掛五百八十元、上午十一點三刻小十元、下午四點又低十元、計五百六十元、收進减卅元云、</p>
<p>貼現十元進關</p>
<p>昨滙　　　貼現率、失再狂落、每千元貼出亦已退入十元內、致貼進出賣價已見軋　、上午貼進步小至八元二角半、貼出僅九元二角半左右、比上週六再跌二元二角半、錢業公會拆息、反升起一分、早午兩市均掛一角二分云、</p>
<h3>外幣大都下降　惟日票獨堅</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、因和平空氣仍未肖滅、兼以謠傳香港形勢突緊、致烚赤市價暴落、英金票因無人顧問、市盤呆定、美金票各方供給奇旺、市價賡續下降、晚市退為十五元五角、香港票隨港滬滙兌下落四分、此外如新加坡·羅比·菲列濱·坎拿大等票均趨低落、日金票復漲一分、晚市高至一元四角八分、朝鮮票需要殷切僅漲一分、晚市為一元二角一分、</p>
<h3>糧食　外滙放長　洋米又滾滾而來　囤戶抬價終歸失敗而仍見小</h3>
<p>洋米陸續不絕來滬、怡和洋行明生輪、自香港裝來三千零四十六包、前日（二十六日）晚至埠、停靠法租界羅斯福碼頭、昨已起缷完竣、又太古公司瓊州輪由香港運來七千四百七十四包、又慶元輪亦自香港裝來三千零七十七包、兩均於昨晨到滬、慶元累停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起缷、瓊州輪停靠浦東本行碼頭起缷、（租）</p>
<p>昨晨洋米開市後、因前日星期休假、舖作實銷頗有到市添辦、浮戶散客亦有問津、市面似有欣欣向榮之象、然價漲五六角後、即有大戶乘機售出、且以前定洋米續有整批轉埠、大量途貨不久可以全部來滬、市上賣氣極濃、市卽盤旋而下、午收仍與週六晚市相似、計一號新西貢高自六十七元四角至六十六元半、二號七十二元二角次至七十一元、特自火絞六十六元至六十四元半、二號　邏高自六十一元次至五十九元、小絞六十元零五角至五十九元、米　五十五元二角至五十五元、碎尖五十一元二角至五十元零七角、東京砶尖五十六元半、蕪湖砶客尖五十八元八角至五十七元、及下午因外滙長、不利於囤貨、市面虛軟、銳落一元、二號紅寶塔牌早市六十二元二角、下午僅六十一元一二角零、回籠原包早市七十四元半、午後七十四元尙乏暢化、羅司之二號西貢祇七十三元、又路貨七十二元半、晚收仍軟、全日開原包現路各貨三百五十噸、現貨六千包、</p>
<p>新粳尖及窰種野稻一等米、兩朝共到二千餘包、其中窰種居多、而去路又細、致售價較鬆、見貶半元有奇、開七十五元、至七十四元二角、新粳及野稻到銷相垺、無甚上落、新粳開高自七十三元次至七十一元、原包七十四元半、野稻七十九元、次至七十七元、杜洋尖仍乏軒輊、原包均售七十元、破粳昨七十元、次至七十四元、原包八十元、糯米國洋兩貨亦皆平半、</p>
<h3>定價步鬆　現粉軟化</h3>
<p>麺米　昨日依然平疲無神、查一號粉廠盤仍為十七元、客盤十八元五角、均與上週相埒、而各廠批出數量已逾萬包、足敷本街需用、故回籠貨老車棧單已乏止式受主、現洋粉逐見軟化、因巨額定粉已裝運在途、如無阻礙、不日卽可抵埠、且澳洲粉定價步鬆、　　　　祇售十五元三角、雖未　定、而人心頹萎、統市售開雙鷹牌十九元一角至十九元、及三角牌洋粉僅售十八元半、由本街辦去三四百包、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市况、不脫僵持之局、因　日供求兩乏、絕　正式做開、聞日廠方面、推價仍為二十一元、除偶有零星到貨、直接解廠外、運入租界者、日見缺乏、故市面淸寂如常、</p>
<p>紗花　轉買為賣　紗價驟小</p>
<p>堅昂兩月之紗市、今則漸呈不穩而有下降之象、此因過去香港幫辦去之粗細紗數量、殊屬可觀、該幫納胃暫有飽滿之狀、或須稍待融化後再當採辦、同時多頭拉力過强、一遇不良環境、虛風尤甚、加之外匯步長、黃金下挫、一般將棉紗作標金看待者、心思業已轉變、而傾向翻空、不過大戶有一部份看漲、惟賣方在遠月頻頻加碼、雙馬廠單　落三十餘元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開氣勢已見渙散、大槪獲利之多頭紛紛吐出、二十支雙馬首盤價為一千二百六十五元、微升至一千二百六十七元、然拋賣者及多頭了結相繼而來、一般搶帽子之輩、見風駛舵、一時　面上籌碼供過於求、掮客之叫喊逐步向下、跌至一千二百四十八元、有一部份空頭抵補、回升至一千二百五十五元、此價迴旋殊久、終以客銷呆滯、美匯長出六元外、交易所行市復趨下風、浮多驚慌忍痛了結、市價乃告不支、直瀉至一千二百三十元、查半日間成交統計五千六百四十包、行情二十支雙馬跌三十五元、茲將各賣口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>香港三六〇　同行五、一八〇　統計五、六四〇</p>
<p>今日出口運往香港有棉紗三千一百九十件、但昨日自港香運來、亦有棉紗一百三十九件、</p>
<h3>棉市淸淡</h3>
<p>現棉情形稍見軟弱、此因紗市下跌、而外滙頻頻放長、致人心平庸、惟同業心思依然挺昂、不過廠方需用不旺、但互相買賣尙不缺乏、行情已見不振、今日有棉花四百六十五包、運香港、</p>
<p>外棉市價紐約棉市、市况靜寂、因缺乏重要之買戶、續後又因貨爾街之賣出、結果收盤價格較之上日降落三磅音、印度市况平靜、昨日連同預測、無甚軒輊、滬埠外棉交易昨日亦稍轉靜寂、各方又以滙兌之猛鬆、故俱又轉抱觀望、故昨日市上交易稍淸也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　紗價一跌　布價暴落</h3>
<p>國布　昨市趨軟、蓋受棉紗東疋猛跌影響、心思交易轉趨冷淡、惟客幫實銷、仍有採辦、故售盤頻以支持、白貨細布斜紋午前平定、午後每疋降價二華廠貨每疋跌二角半之譜、色布漂布跌五角、浙閩幫辦粗細布色布漂布二百餘件、本街成　坯布漂染布二百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　晨市尙平、後市狂跌、乃以原紗暴落、散戶恐慌、投機商趁勢拋賣、致細布細斜每疋驟降一元半之譜、十二磅龍頭細布收盤為三十六元七角、四君子嗶嘰一元一角三分半、但洋行絕無訂開、　銷仍佳、故同業中人態度依然鎭靜、</p>
<p>出口　疋頭、今日有三千二百五十件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>證券　外匯鬆勢　外股失所進展　—內債又見疲勢—</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市趨勢又在緩緩疲落、初由五和大通及一般散戶買進、而丙種再見六十元、繼以鴻大賣出而回小、松茂怡泰買百不多、市價稍一盤旋、又轉鬆軟、午收卽跌落三四角、午後初開多方再行拉抬、長　仁昌又在買進、一般散戶隨之跟進、復又抬高三四角、入後久豐聯和鴻大、又有賣出、再行回小二三角、市價一日數變、結果除戊種略好一角外、餘均回小二三角、成交總數共計約一百二三十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易成交紗布交易所股一百股、價為四十二元正、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤滯呆、嗣因會德豐及和啤酒股成交激增、市況始有轉機、前者之漲、蓋因謠傳其有將宣布股息、後者賣戶雖湧、堅勢始終維持、晨初開拍價為八元、一時賣者蝟信、立將價壓低至七元六角、是價有人竭力支持、收盤價為七元七角半、成交十七萬七千股、由於上述二股之蓬勃、其餘實業股橡皮股幾全被忽視、滙票鬆勢猛烈、影響於股市之進展者非細、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖交易沉寂</h3>
<p>昨糖市趨勢、依然平疲、而交易異常淸寂、公會　盤、現貨一四粗白無成交、轉口貨仍五十八元、荷赤見軟、現貨五十五元、太古車白B嘜七十二元、小五角、東棧七十一元一角、HX嘜四棧六十七元半、小三角、東棧六十六元半、HN嘜六十四元、</p>
<h3>油市　來油不絕　油價平疲</h3>
<p>昨日油市在中途雖有波浪起伏、但結果無甚榮辱、惟期貨較上週末之市稍挫元許、故在供過於求之情形下、依然看疲、共計成交膠州豆油一百五十件、價為七十五元、靑島豆油二十桶價為九十九元、本廠豆油一百担、價為八十五元、花生油做開烟台油五十件、價為六十九元半、又聽裝一千聽、價為九十七元、膠州油二百五十件、價為七十元至零五角、再回至七十元、路貨二禮拜交一百件、價為七十元零七角半至零五角、靑島生油一百五十桶、價為九十八元半至九十九元、復跌至九十八元、訂十一月上交三百桶、價為九十九元七角半、復降至九十八元二角半、再後收盤為九十八元五角、訂十一月下交四百桶、價為一百元零五角、直瀉至九十九元、收盤回升五角、訂十二月下交五十桶、價為一百零二元二角半至一百零二元五角、</p>
<p>廿八日進口豆子一千五百五十包、天津來、生油四千五百四十五聽、烟台來、廿九日出口豆子一千三百包、生油一千聽、蔴油四百五十聽、均運香港、</p>
<h3>南北貨　廣東圓開頭盤</h3>
<p>新桂圓昨由慶元輪續到二百數十箱、又廣東貨首批到一百數十箱、當已開出、價為二百九十三元、此次續到者為同安及漳州貨、市價有轉鬆可能、</p>
<h3>藥材　梔子升六七元</h3>
<p>小梔子因近無到貨、市存漸缺、而銷路雖屬零星、尙稱活動、故市勢轉起、比前回升六七元、高貨約九十元之譜</p>
<h3>煤炭　婆羅洲煤减盤</h3>
<p>婆羅洲烟煤、前以存貨告罄、本市曾一度斷檔、日來聞新貨已有一批到埠、加之新近外滙連日放長、成本自减、開價亦覺便宜、計做同業報價、婆羅洲塊煤每噸一百八十六元、統煤一百八十二元、棧房車貨行槓外加、</p>

<p>— 何天行</p>
<p>鈴聲響了，</p>
<p>孩子們像潮水似的湧了出來，</p>
<p>樓梯上如落下一陣暴雨，</p>
<p>弄堂裏都擠滿了喧嘩，歡笑。</p>
<p>有的說，</p>
<p>「張先生，再會！」</p>
<p>有的說，</p>
<p>「張先生，徐文晋搶我的東西。」</p>
<p>有的說，</p>
<p>「張先生！王國寳踢我的屁股。」</p>
<p>張先生是他們的老師，</p>
<p>今年五十歲了，</p>
<p>在學校中除「校長」以外，</p>
<p>張老師是最辛苦的一個。</p>
<p>每天六小時的課程，</p>
<p>從歷史到地理，</p>
<p>從國文到自然。</p>
<p>每逢　學的時候，</p>
<p>張老師已疲乏得走不動路。</p>
<p>他蒼白的頭髮，</p>
<p>堆了不少粉筆灰，</p>
<p>更顯得枯燥，衰老。</p>
<p>今年他又染上咳嗽，—</p>
<p>上課時有時竟喘不過氣，</p>
<p>孩子們也偶而看了發笑；</p>
<p>但見張老師咳出了淚珠，</p>
<p>在嚴肅的空氣中，</p>
<p>孩子們也要流出眼淚了。</p>
<p>張老師從樓梯上緩緩下來，</p>
<p>夾著一包作文和練習簿。</p>
<p>秋風吹上了他瘦削的兩肩；</p>
<p>在接連的咳嗽中，</p>
<p>他又想到：</p>
<p>今晚還是吃陽春麵呢？</p>
<p>還是吃餐薄粥？</p>
<h3>我欲無言</h3>
<p>— 陳煙帆作</p>
<p>家庭</p>
<h3>我是年輕的寡</h3>
<p>— 音央</p>
<p>家庭的腐敗，和感情的不洽，是人生最痛苦的事；我是一個飽受痛苦的年輕寡孀，每天在惑劣的環境裏，過着悲慘的生活，刺傷了我純潔的心臟</p>
<p>我的公公是上海某行的經理，他是很精明而很隨便的，俗語說：「大勿算，小尖鑽。」就是。他的第一個髮妻，生了三個女孩，巳在二十多年前無條件地雙方脫離了（據說現在還在世間）。第二個妻子生了我的丈夫和一個小姑後，就瞑目逝世了。現在的一位太太，據說是堂子　的大姐，也巳經生了二僩兒子，目下各在中小學裹念書。</p>
<p>當我們婚後不到半載，這位、三號太太的晚娘眞面，就毫不客氣地顯露出來了。到處找尋岔子，爲了巧言的煽動，因此常常可以聽到公公的嚴厲命令而受着毫無人道的責罰，最後還要迫使父子分居。唉！眞痛心極了，我們忠實的、羣，都做了她的手頭玩具。</p>
<p>光陰無情地流着，二年多的時間忽忽地過去了。不幸得很，丈夫為了天天憂鬰在心，和為了生活的操　過度，漸漸地患起了重病；消息傳到了家裏，其間經過新族和尊長們的『勸吿」，才允許回家養病。那知病一天天的更深重，連醫生也吿束手了，終至，他就沉痛地棄了我和未滿五月的兒子而與世長逝了。我的心快要碎了，神志也昏迷了，這是我終身最大的打擊，內心的痛苦和惡勢力的壓迫，也漸漸地隨之而增加了。向誰去訴苦呢？祇得懷抱了天眞可愛的孩子飲泣着。孩子跟着日子而慢慢地長大着，丈夫的死也巳經三年了，孩子會叫起淸脆的「媽」了，可是」爸，呢？太可憐了，他是一個沒有爸的孩子，什麼都要吃虧，都要退在人家後面。</p>
<p>一切的浪費，在「三號太太」的手裏是很慣的，不過範圍祗限於他們母子三人。如果遇到了親族們的光顧，她就要實行緊縮主義和節的運動了，這是她的一貫政策。她的驕傲性濃厚到極了，時常可以聽她說：一切的親族友朋，有啥道理，只要我有錢，什麼都不怕了。念年前的今天恐怕都巳經忘了，因此親族們沒有一個願　來看他的隔夜面孔。萬一到了這可怕的家裹，她一定會顯出各種不同的表情，冷淡，護笑，怨恨，胆胠，畏　…不時的變勦着。</p>
<p>「三號太太、的毒辣手段，不能完全從我的筆尖上寫　，祇好讓它埋藏在我底慘痛的心　。公公的頭腦是無法改變了，家庭的命運也巳經注定了。可憐的我，祇有忍耐地幹起丈夫遺下的責任—培養我天眞的孩兒，打破舊禮敎制度下的腐敗惡習，努力地重建一個純潔、美滿、快樂的家庭。</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>能不能與應不應</h3>
<p>— 權</p>
<p>在滬戰前，我也聽到婦女參政的高度呼聲。那時我妹妹剛在一個大學畢業，懷着一顆熱烈希望的心，在某機關做事，她的前途是多麼的光明呀！不料八一三事起，姊姊就停職，轉輾避難到孤島來。接着她和陸君結婚，她原擬將來同途出發，踏上新的前程。誰知一年後，我的姊姊完全變樣了。在小家庭中，終日撫着愛兒外，不能抽身片刻。她精神和肉體漸漸憔悴了。有一决，我問她，甚麼時候才出發上社會去，她苦笑着，搖了搖頭，祇說「這個希望現在屬於你的了」。</p>
<p>像姊姊那樣的才幹，她有淸晰的頭腦，她有豐富的學識，有强壯的身子，她在社會上做事的效率，何嘗比男子小？她是應當上社會去，可是目前姊姊是受家累；她雖有高超的志願，但是不能分身。何况各機關往往又限制招收巳婚婦女，像上决郵局的招考，就是一例。所以今日婦女上社會做事，問題的核心，在於能不能，而不是應不應。</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>長衫</h3>
<p>— 瘦牛</p>
<p>讀書人往往穿長衫，但是穿長衫不便勞動，所以穿長杉的人就不勞動，自然而然地形成「上等人」了。</p>
<p>上等人漸漸多起來，無產階級的人也都穿了長衫，也受到長衫的束縛，不能勞動了。然而又沒有大事可做，那末祗好束緊腰帶喝冷水，自己明白</p>
<p>衣服楚人的奴隸，人並非衣服的奴隸。為了身體而穿衣，並非為衣服而生個模型。萬一環境不如意，畏杉一脫，照樣低就，那末才是能屈能伸的大丈夫了。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的婦宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十章　皮鞋問題</p>
<p>我也驚喜得很來不及說話，忙在衣袋中摸出那捲軟尺來，湊在那皮鞋底上量了一量，果眞是十一吋六。</p>
<p>我瞧着霍桑，問道：「對，這皮鞋是陸健笙的嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑不答，他的發光的眼睛仍射在皮鞋上。他又用左手的指尖在皮鞋底上撫摩。他又低低地驚呼：「包朗，你也摸一摸，這鞋底分明還沒有乾透！」</p>
<p>我果眞依着他的話，用手指在皮鞋底上摸一摸，隨卽點點頭。</p>
<p>他又緊張地說：「你仔細瞧瞧，這鞋跟和鞋底的邊緣，有什麼　狀？…沒有嗎？你瞧得不仔細啊。你粗看鞋跟上好像很乾凈，其實還有些泥水的痕跡，還不會抹得乾淨。你瞧，這底邊上面針縫　還留着不少泥哩。」</p>
<p>我點頭作領悟狀道：一那末，這皮鞋昨夜裏有人穿過，後來經人把泥水抹乾淨。對不對？」　霍桑道：「對，不過抹得不十分乾淨。這叫做百密一疏。還有，你瞧，這鞋帶頭上沾着汚泥。你懂得它的來由嗎？…什麼？不懂？那是很容易明白的。就因為—」</p>
<p>「砰！—砰！」</p>
<p>這聲　雖然隔着玻璃窗傳進來，並不怎樣刺耳，但我和霍桑都聽得出是手槍聲音，決不是其他聲響。這槍聲的來由，好像就在這屋子的大門外面，在這個時候，忽然有這聲昔，當然不能使霍桑認為沒有關係。他立卽把皮鞋重新放回在壁櫥裏去，照樣將壁橱門關好，隨即向我招一招手，一言不發便從房間裏奔出去。我也跟在他後面。一刹那間霍桑巳奔下樓梯向前門口出去。</p>
<p>我趕到樓梯脚下的時候，金梅也巳開了會客室的門，驚惶地走出來。伊問我說：「先生，什麼事呀？」</p>
<p>我不能回，但搖搖頭，繼續向外面走。我踏上那水泥徑時，瞧見霍桑巳從那盤花的鐵門口走出去。我向左右一望，門外很淸淨，祇有一輛汽車從西面駛過來，向東面去。（一五〇）</p>

<h3>迎再生中德國產時裝片</h3>
<p>— 孫若鑒</p>
<p>天下事總沒有一成不變的。就孤島上的國產電影來說吧，也是不能逃出道個定律，此時此地，因為環境的特殊，古裝片就應時而生，同時原有的時裝片幾乎完全匿跡。前些時，古裝片已到了最高潮，如今，據說時裝片正要再度的萌芽生長。事實也在吿訴我們，巳攝製的有金星的「秦淮世家」和國華的一天涯歌女一。</p>
<p>在過去的古裝片，它對於觀衆們的印象，有好有壞：如「李香君」，「葛嫩娘」，「木蘭從軍」「梁紅玉」…因為題材的悲壯莊嚴，對於孤島同胞，的確算是比較含有特別深長意義的；其他也有是發揮中國固有的美德，在世風日下的今日，這些實在是値得我們讚美和提倡的。不過從另一方而說，那些專以狹義的兒女私情為主體，故事大半寫些「私定終身後花園，公子落難中狀元」等事，這實在　不在少數，它們除了製片商為着生意起見，投婦孺們之所好，作為茶餘飯後的消造品而外，是別無其他重要含　的。</p>
<p>因為古裝片的盛行，而使製片商日夜競攝，造成過去「粗製濫造」的現象。在攝製方面，當然說不上什麼好成績了—甚至有一些影片裏，光綫暗得發黑，以致片上人物完全糢糊不淸；收音方面，也是糟不可言這些實在是古裝片在潮中，最　明的一個惡果。</p>
<p>現在，時裝片又繼古裝片而「再生」了。很希望製片商認淸「電影是民衆敎育的一種」，並且負着孤島民衆敎育的重任，對於再生中的時裝片一，須用「去　存菁」的方法—把古裝片中含有意義的題材，讓它依然存在時裝片裏—來完成這重大使命。不要專從生意眼上打主意，而冉來粗製濫迭，一誤再誤。要知道粗製濫造，不但無利可圖，並且要使得觀衆對於你們的公司出品，生了惡劣印象，這樣簡直會自趨沒落之路。</p>

<h3>Guizhou Provincial Chinese Army Recovers Nanning, Longzhou, Mingjiang, and Suilu Simultaneously Declared Recovered, Allegations of Conflicts Between French and Chinese Troops on Vietnamese Border Denied</h3>
<p>Chongqing officials have formally announced that Nanning, the famous Guangxi provincial city occupied by the Japanese army on November 24, 1939, has now been recovered by the Chinese army. (According to a United Press reporter, Guangzhou Japanese sources claim that the Japanese army has officially announced that it is voluntarily withdrawing from Nanning because its occupation is meaningless after the Japanese army entered Vietnam.) (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Last night, Chinese forces on various lines in Liuzhou and southern Guangxi launched attacks on several fronts. One unit pressed towards Longzhou after dusk, fighting fiercely throughout the night, and completely recovered Longzhou at 3:30 AM this morning. At the same time, another Chinese army unit also recovered Mingjiang. The Chinese army is now pursuing the enemy on separate paths. Furthermore, the Chinese army on the left bank of the Zuo River also launched an attack simultaneously, recovering Suilu this afternoon. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>According to semi-official Japanese sources in Guangzhou, Lieutenant General Koyu, commander-in-chief of the Japanese army in South China, announced today that the Japanese army has voluntarily withdrawn from Nanning because continuing to occupy the city is meaningless after the Japanese army entered Vietnam. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Since the 23rd, Chinese forces in Binyang and southern Guangxi have launched fierce attacks on the periphery of Nanning along the Yongbin Road, advancing to Santang and recovering Jinyuling. On the south side, Chinese forces in the Jiandao area captured Datouling. Chinese forces on the western front pressed towards Shibu. Japanese soldiers in Nanning received repeated reinforcements and were supported by aircraft and artillery, but the Chinese army, determined to win, fought with the strength of a hundred, repeatedly charging the Japanese and advancing fiercely. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese counterattacked Gan Village, Huxiang, and Yiling, attempting to contain the Chinese army. The Chinese army fought with increasing vigor and still defeated the Japanese on the Yongwu Road. At the same time, Chinese forces on the Yongjiang River bank also fiercely attacked the enemy in the Gaoling and Side Village area. The vanguard of the Chinese army has now reached the suburbs of Nanning, and the Japanese army in Nanning is shaken and appears to be retreating south. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Regarding the alleged conflict between Chinese and French troops on the Vietnamese border, Chinese military authorities here have not received any reports. Chinese circles are skeptical of this claim, as the Chinese army has not entered Vietnamese territory at any point. It is reported that after French Ambassador Goki Mok arrived in Chongqing from Vietnam, French authorities urged the National Government not to send troops to the Vietnamese border because the situation in Vietnam was already quite difficult, and sending Chinese troops would only exacerbate the disputes. Although the Chinese authorities have not guaranteed that Chinese troops will not enter Vietnamese territory, the National Government has not announced that the Chinese army will take this action. The National Government previously announced the reasons for destroying the bridges and dismantling the railway tracks on the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Therefore, it is expected that if the Chinese army needs to enter Vietnamese territory, it will also declare the reasons for this serious action in advance. Some people believe that this rumor was spread by the Japanese army to create a pretext for attacking Yunnan province from Vietnam. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Chinese military authorities here in Chongqing have denied the rumors of a conflict between Chinese and French troops on the Vietnamese border. When Reuters reporters inquired about this news this morning, Chinese military authorities said that they had no information at present, but promised to continue investigating. Subsequently, the authorities announced that the news was completely untrue. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Besieged Near Shaoxing</h3>
<p>According to sources in Jinhua, Japanese troops near Shaoxing are currently under siege and attack by Chinese forces. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>On the 27th, Japanese troops who invaded Gaobu City, east of Shaoxing, were fiercely attacked by a Chinese unit and retreated eastward. (Dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Regarding the battle situation in eastern Zhejiang, a Chinese military spokesman in Chongqing recently stated that Japanese troops east of Shaoxing were intercepted by Chinese forces in Gaobu City, less than 20 kilometers from Shaoxing, suffering heavy casualties. They retreated on the 27th to Donghu, less than 10 kilometers from Shaoxing. The Chinese army is currently pursuing them, and the prospects for the battle are quite promising. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>According to Jinhua news in Chongqing, Japanese troops at Gaobu, 17 kilometers east of Shaoxing, were repelled by Chinese forces on Sunday. It is also reported that the Japanese army is burning the Shaoxing area due to Chinese counterattacks from various directions. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Kunming Suffers Air Raid Yesterday, Over Twenty Civilians Killed and Injured, Chengdu Also Bombed by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>At around 11:00 AM on the 28th, twelve Japanese aircraft invaded Kunming and dropped multiple bombs in a certain area outside the city, killing and injuring over twenty Chinese civilians and destroying over ten civilian houses. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>According to a Chengdu telegram from Chongqing, twenty-two Japanese aircraft bombed the southwestern district of Chengdu this afternoon. The bombed area was quite extensive, with many houses destroyed and some people killed and injured. There were no military losses. The Japanese aircraft did not drop incendiary bombs. An emergency alert was also issued in Chengdu yesterday, but no Japanese aircraft appeared. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Military Supplies Intercepted by Japanese</h3>
<p>According to the London Daily Express, American military supplies worth 10 million yuan, originally intended to be shipped to China, have been intercepted by the Japanese army on the French ship "West River" in Hanoi. However, the newspaper did not disclose details. (International News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Donations for Aircraft Purchases</h3>
<p>Since the National Government promoted the donation campaign for aircraft purchases, Chinese people from all over China and overseas Chinese have been enthusiastically donating money. Among them, overseas Chinese in New York contributed US$5 million, overseas Chinese in San Francisco contributed US$1 million, and overseas Chinese in the Republic of Panama contributed US$70,000. Children in Hunan Province donated their pocket money to purchase an aircraft, which will be named "Children." The press also purchased one aircraft. The people of Sichuan Province plan to purchase 100 fighter planes, and Wu Qi, a wealthy businessman in Guiyang, donated one aircraft. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Acknowledgment Telegrams Received for Autumn Festival Troop慰勞</h3>
<p>The National慰勞 General Association previously organized troop慰勞 for the Autumn Festival, using one million yuan as代金 for mooncakes to give to soldiers at the front to boost morale. The association has now received replies from Wei Lihuang, Yan Xishan, Gu Zhutong, Zhang Fakui, Chen Cheng, Zhu Shaoliang, Xue Yue, and Commander-in-Chief Yu Xuezhong, expressing their gratitude on behalf of all the soldiers.

<h3>Senators Who are Also People's Political Councilors Must Choose One Position, Decision of the Central Executive Committee Yesterday, Notification Already Sent to Provinces and Cities</h3>
<p>For the re-election of the second session of the National参政会, provinces are actively proceeding. However, regarding whether provincial and municipal temporary senators who are elected as参政員 can still concurrently hold their original positions, many provinces have requested clarification. The Central Executive Committee decided today that provincial and municipal temporary senators who are elected as 参政員 can only choose to hold one position and cannot concurrently hold the positions of senator (including speaker and vice-speaker) and 参政員. A letter has been sent to the Executive Yuan to notify the provinces and cities. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>New County System in Hubei Begins Experimentation</h3>
<p>A reporter from Badong recently met with the person in charge of the Hubei Provincial Government in western Hubei. According to him, the new county system in Hubei has already begun to be experimented with in several counties such as Enshi. The general results are satisfactory. From January next year, all counties in the province will fully implement the new county system. Regarding the prohibition of opium in Hubei Province, I (the person in charge of the provincial government said) am determined to thoroughly prohibit it according to the instructions of the President, ensuring that there is not a single tael of opium or a single opium addict in the province. Opium cultivation in the province was completely eradicated in September of this year. From January next year, anyone who still smokes opium will be executed. The work of production and construction in Hubei Province is also progressing rapidly. The Hubei Construction Department has established factories in various inland areas according to local conditions to produce a large amount of goods. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Xinhua Daily Advocates the Internal Transfer of Floating Capital</h3>
<p>The Xinhua Daily in Chongqing recently published an article advocating the complete transfer of the Chinese government's financial institutions, including various banks in Shanghai and 300,000 yuan of national currency, to the inland areas. The newspaper stated that Shanghai, even after the government moved to Chongqing, is still the country's economic center. The huge financial losses suffered by the government are due to efforts to maintain the black market exchange rate in Shanghai. Before the relocation of the four national banks to Chongqing in the summer of 1939, this foreign exchange was entirely used by the Japanese. If the British and American people evacuate Shanghai, to prevent the Japanese from seizing it, the government should as soon as possible evacuate all its economic institutions in Shanghai. The newspaper also stated that the government's financial and industrial investments in Shanghai are no longer beneficial to China due to the Japanese blockade. It advocates taking measures to completely transfer these economic institutions to the inland areas to develop inland industries and construction. The newspaper further stated that this move would have no impact on the Chinese currency in Shanghai, because the Chinese people in all the so-called occupied areas firmly believe in the legal tender. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Remarkable Results in Winter Clothing Donations in Henan</h3>
<p>All sectors of society in Henan, including Luoyang, are actively donating winter clothing and 代金. As of now, 19,573 cotton vests and over 155,900 yuan in 代金 have been collected. Workers in various industries in Luoyang City voluntarily donated 375.6 yuan. The authorities have issued a commendation order. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Expands Military Service Propaganda</h3>
<p>Since the Meixian Branch of the San民主义 Youth League in Xingning expanded its propaganda campaign for the youth to join the army, an increasing number of youths from various townships have enthusiastically performed military service. The number of soldiers from various townships in the county who joined the army in September increased by 480 compared to the previous month, and increased sharply by 1,408 in October, demonstrating the effect of expanding propaganda. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Relief Committee Adds Refugee Factories</h3>
<p>The National Relief Committee previously allocated over one million yuan to establish ten refugee factories to manufacture cloth, paper, porcelain, leather, chemical drugs, and other items. It has now decided to allocate another 500,000 yuan to add five small-scale refugee factories, which are scheduled to start work at the end of this year. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications Defends Zhu Jiahua</h3>
<p>He Molin, Director of the Navigation Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications in Chongqing, issued a statement refuting a report in a Shanghai newspaper by a British man named Thomson who claimed to have naturalized in China, stating that when Zhu Jiahua was Minister of Communications, his request for a captain's certificate was denied and Zhu had attempted to induce him to offer a bribe. According to He, in recent years, the Ministry of Communications has been extremely strict in the management of crew members, and has promulgated and implemented regulations for the examination of crew members. Whether they are drivers or engine room personnel, they must pass an examination before a certificate can be issued. According to the regulations, the person should have taken the examination, but he always refused to take the examination and asked people everywhere to intercede. As a result, the Ministry approved that it could not be issued due to the regulations. The accusation that former Minister Zhu induced bribery and advised him to pay a huge fee is laughable to those in the know. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>US Embassy in Beijing Urges Nationals to Evacuate</h3>
<p>The US Embassy in Beijing today advised US nationals in Beijing that there would be a ship available for evacuation on November 3 and that the embassy urged its people to give this matter "the most serious consideration." It was also learned that the Matson Line mail ship "Mariposa" will arrive in Qinhuangdao on November 13 to evacuate US nationals in North China. The ticket price has not changed.

At the same time, it also sent a congratulatory telegram to Turkish Ambassador to China Sibasi. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Banquets Soviet Ambassador, Sun Ke and Feng Yuxiang Invited to Accompany</h3>
<p>At 7:30 PM today, Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Chonghui hosted a banquet at his official residence for Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin and Soviet Commercial Representative to China Bagulin. Sun Ke and Feng Yuxiang were invited to accompany them. (Dispatch, 28th)</p>

Czech soldiers and aviators will be proud to work closely with their British comrades. Today, the merits of the British are admired by the civilized world. The British King replied, praising the bravery of the Czech people in resisting German aggression, and said that it was fortunate to have such loyal and brave soldiers to defend the freedom of Britain, the Czech Republic, and all of Europe.

<h3>The Prospect of Italy's Invasion of Greece</h3>
<p>Just a week ago, this newspaper pointed out, based on the recent international trends, that Greece is one of the countries in question on the eve of what is currently evolving into a world war. Over the past week, the various political and diplomatic offensives launched by Germany and Italy, as well as the reported peace offensives, have also been exposed by this newspaper as another aspect of attempting to expand the war. Unfortunately, the facts have closely followed our observations: news last night indicated that after issuing an ultimatum to Greece at 3 AM yesterday, Italy invaded Greek territory at 6 AM. As of the time this reporter is writing, it is known that German leader Hitler yesterday again met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, which undoubtedly involves some new and noteworthy strategies that are connected to Italy's invasion of Greece. However, how Greece, Turkey, and other parts of the Balkan Peninsula will react to Italy's invasion, and how the overall situation will unfold, is yet to be reported. But looking at the causes and consequences, unless the news of Italy's invasion of Greece is completely inaccurate, or unless the Italian troops suddenly withdraw after entering Greece, then regardless of whether Greece's resistance is victorious or not, in short, the European war has expanded to the Balkans, and the largest powder keg in Europe has exploded.</p>
<p>Italy's invasion of Greece clearly demonstrates the vastness of Germany and Italy's desire for conquest and their determination to dominate the overall situation. It is not merely empty talk on paper. A country like Greece, which neither competes with Germany and Italy nor poses a threat to them, cannot avoid being subject to their aggression. If it is said that Germany and Italy are only opposed to Britain, and that in order to crush Britain and eliminate its bases in the Mediterranean and the Near East, they have to pass through Greece, that invading Greece is not to destroy Greece but to target Britain, and that this is an explanation of knocking down passers-by to catch up with the road, then of course no one can believe it. Therefore, leaving aside the various issues related to Britain and Germany, world public opinion will undoubtedly sympathize with Greece for being invaded.</p>
<p>Greece is a small country in the southeastern corner of Europe, at the southern end of the Balkan Peninsula, occupying a corner of the continent and standing with numerous islands. Its territory is only 130,000 square kilometers, and its population is less than 7 million. However, it is the earliest source of European civilization, having experienced countless periods of rise, fall, survival, and destruction. Its recent period of independence is only a little over 100 years, but it has already experienced many decisive international wars. The cultural level of the people is relatively high, at least it can be regarded as one of the best in the Balkan Peninsula. Most people are engaged in agriculture and commerce. There are no rich deposits within the country, and it is definitely not a big fish or a piece of fat meat in the eyes of the invaders, and is not enough to be an important resource for military aggression. Only the marble produced can be used as a precious embellishment on tombs, which is certainly not the main purpose of plunder! It is bordered by Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to the north, and Albania, conquered by Italy. When Albania was destroyed, Greece already had a sense of imminent danger. The southwest and south sides extend into the Mediterranean Sea, facing Italy to the west and Egypt and Italian Libya to the south. The Aegean Sea embraces the east, bordering Turkey. Assuming that Germany and Italy are determined to launch an eastern expedition, Greece will protect one-third of the eastern Mediterranean and will be the first to bear the brunt. However, there is absolutely no reason why Germany and Italy must conquer Greece before they can launch an eastern expedition. The Mediterranean Sea is so vast!</p>
<p>From the political and diplomatic trends of Greece in recent years, it can be predicted that its reaction to today's invasion will inevitably be to resist with all its strength. It has close relations with Turkey and an agreement of mutual assistance with Britain. In other words, it has multiple international connections in peacetime. When it is invaded and at war, Britain and Turkey are the countries it looks up to the most. As things stand now, Britain will inevitably provide full assistance to Greece, regardless of its political reasons, treaty obligations, or military strategies, under the premise that Greece resists. The strength of the Greek army is not very low and is worth fighting for. Its air force and navy are far inferior to Italy's, but its naval and air base facilities are not to be ignored and also put pressure on Italy. If it now provides its naval and air bases to Britain for use as much as possible due to fighting alongside Britain, it will have great value and great benefit for Britain's military operations in the Mediterranean and the Near East. Britain's aid to Greece is certainly in a very early and effective plan, and it is absolutely not comparable to the aid to Poland and Norway in the past. However, whether this aid can fully meet the needs depends on whether Britain can effectively deal with Germany's blitzkrieg strategy against the British Isles. Therefore, we cannot make an unconditional judgment on whether the actual effect of aid to Greece can be fully realized as originally planned. As for Turkey, this newspaper also stated five days ago that its influence on the direction of the European war is far-reaching, and it is one of the countries in question in the overall situation. Five or six days ago, this was a subtle mystery. Now, Greece has been invaded, the flames of war have spread to the Balkan Peninsula and triggered the largest powder keg. Turkey can be seen as being forced to the point where it must immediately decide its attitude. It is no longer a subtle mystery but a critical moment for decision-making!</p>
<p>Who knows where Turkey will go? We will then base our analysis on the close relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey and observe the Soviet Union's future attitude towards the European war and the overall world situation based on Turkey's obedience or resistance. This is the key observation that Italy's invasion of Greece gives us.</p>
<h3>Emrys-Evans' Speech Reviews the International Situation: Hitler's Attempt Has Failed, Britain is Determined to Embrace Europe</h3>
<p>London - Emrys-Evans, the Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, delivered a speech in Gosport last night reviewing the international diplomatic and military situation. He stated that although the battle for Britain has not yet passed, its outcome has certainly been decided. After this, the battles of the British Empire will follow. Hitler initially wanted to strike the heart of the British Empire with one blow and disintegrate it. Now that his attempt has failed, he will launch a fierce attack on the second most important point of the British Empire, namely, Britain's control of the Mediterranean, Britain's lifeline to the East, and Britain's position on both sides of the Suez Canal. If Hitler can indeed drive us out of the East, then Hitler can hope not only to securely take the oil of Iraq and the cotton of Turkey and Egypt for his use, but can also transport oil and cotton by sea through the ports of his vassal states. At this point, he will have broken the British blockade and can then threaten India and British Africa. We know where his purpose lies, so we must pay attention to the events that have occurred in Romania, the conspiracy to destroy Bulgaria's independence, and the background of Hitler's meetings with Franco and Pétain. Although we cannot determine where Hitler's new attempt will be launched and how it will be launched, we must crush his attempts, just as we crushed his invasion plan of Britain, and then we can have the opportunity to attack the enemy. Now, those who are fighting against the dictatorships are not only Britain. The armies that Hitler will see united to bring about his downfall will not only come from Britain. At this time, the representatives of the British Empire southeast of the Suez Canal are gathering in Delhi, India, to consider how to develop their resources as much as possible to produce a greater striking force in the future. This is indeed an extremely important event in history. As Prime Minister Churchill said, this meeting will promote the creation of a new world of armed forces to adjust the balance of the old world. Emrys-Evans stated that the British Air Force will continue to destroy internal resources in Germany. In the early nineteenth century, we defeated Napoleon's fleet at Trafalgar and determined the outcome, but it still took ten years to achieve the final victory at Waterloo. Now, our air power is increasing day by day, and we can hope that Hitler's Waterloo will come more quickly than Napoleon's, and this result is equally certain. As for our war aims, we hope to see the principles on which civilization is based restored in the world, to see the basic rights of justice and freedom of mankind restored in Europe, to see the rights of minorities respected by the majority, and that small countries can coexist peacefully with powerful countries and cooperate with each other instead of being subjected to violence. At the same time, our first task is to defend ourselves with our efforts and to protect Europe with our example. (Reuters dispatch, 28th) The List of the New Australian Cabinet is Announced</p>

<h3>Soviet Gasoline Production Soars: A Powerful Weapon to Defeat the Enemy</h3>
<p>The Moscow Pravda commented today, "The oil industry is a major sector of the Soviet national economy. The more oil we produce, the more consolidated our military and economic power will become. If anyone dares to invade our motherland's borders, Soviet oil will be a powerful weapon to rout the enemy. Upon completion of the Fifth Five-Year Plan, Soviet oil production will increase threefold, and gasoline production will increase twenty-fourfold (compared with 1913). Before the revolution, the oil production of the Tsarist era was far behind that of Europe and America. However, the Soviet Union must not lag behind. Oil production has recently increased. In the third quarter of last year, 46 oil fields and 10 refineries exceeded the original production plan. The workers of Azerbaijan, in order to further enhance the Soviet Union's defense and economic power and to thank the Party, the government, and Stalin for their assistance, have called on workers across the Soviet Union to launch a production competition movement to commemorate the October Revolution."

<h3>President Roosevelt Declares US Prepared to Repel Aggression; To Build Additional 125 Warships To Give Ambitious Warmongers a Head-on Blow</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt declared yesterday that the increase in the US Asian and Atlantic fleets is to repel any dictatorial country that attempts to interfere in the Western Hemisphere. The President's remarks were contained in a letter he sent to Secretary of the Navy Knox on Navy Day. President Roosevelt said in the letter, "The naval expansion program is a head-on blow to the ambitions of those who covet the Western Hemisphere." The President continued, "I take this opportunity to extend my congratulations to your great organizational power. I have the utmost confidence in the Navy. If war is to come, the Navy's intention is to deal with it directly, as the Navy is the bulwark of our nation's political system."

We now live in a world where justice is lost. If we are prepared to respond, we can survive; without this preparation, we will perish or become a vassal of others. If we want to observe a world where the flames of war are raging, we only need to look at Europe or the Far East. Knox continued, "These flames were caused by dictators. We must not forget the old saying that the arrival of events is later than you think." (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Chicago: Secretary of the Navy Knox stated here yesterday that the reason why the British Air Force has been able to defend Britain in the past three months is only because the Navy has prevented enemy troops. The new Navy that the United States will build in the next five years can completely cope with any joint attack launched by the enemy against the United States. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>US Ambassador to Britain Arrives in Washington: President Later Returns to New York</h3>
<p>New York: US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy arrived here yesterday on the American Clipper. He refused to make any statement before meeting with the President.

(United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>New York: US Ambassador to Britain Kennedy, after arriving here from Lisbon, refused to make any remarks about Britain, but said, "When I am done with my business, I will have a lot to say."

<h3>Japan Avoids Agitating the United States: Suma's Evaluation of Er's Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma told reporters today that someone asked him to comment on Secretary of State Hull's speech at the National Press Club in Washington on Saturday. The spokesman replied that Hull was merely reiterating his previously stated opinions. Suma continued that regardless of whether the Washington government changes, he hoped that American politicians would recognize the factual situation in the Far East and have the courage to deal with the facts. Another reporter asked Suma to comment on the American election situation. He said that a year ago, he had the impression that President Roosevelt would win, and it is still the same now. We are not as concerned about changes in the Washington government as we are about the US government's re-establishment of its foreign policy, especially regarding the Far East. He also said that the shocking remarks freely expressed by American politicians are due to the election campaign. Japan should not be agitated by them, but should be self-restrained and ignore such remarks. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

It is claimed that if this American action continues unabated, there is a real danger of "dragging the United States into war." It also says that even if the United States takes such actions, Japan will proceed with its "fair" policy regardless of everything.

<h3>Thailand Expresses Attitude Towards Vietnam: Thai Official Says French Did Break Agreement</h3>
<p>Bangkok: How the second step between Thailand and French Vietnam will be taken depends on France's attitude. Thailand and the French Vietnamese government have not exchanged information for a long time since France rejected Thailand's territorial demands.

<h3>Soviet Authorities Prevent Epidemics</h3>
<p>Moscow: In view of the spread of the plague in Manchuria, the Soviet People's Committee has taken the following measures to prevent the epidemic from invading the Soviet Union: (1) Establish quarantine stations at Otpor and Pugalan Station in Naye District, Vladivostok, Nikolaevka, and at the mouth of the Heilongjiang River. Anyone arriving from Manchuria, Cheongjin, and other places must be inspected. (2) Ships and trains arriving at the above locations must also undergo strict cleaning inspections. (3) Order the Soviet People's Committee for Health Protection and Domestic Affairs, the Executive Committee of Khabarovsk, and the Executive Committee of Chita District to strictly implement quarantine work. Before obtaining the approval of the People's Committee, no quarantine event can be ignored. (TASS dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Employees of American Trading Company Arrested in Vietnam</h3>
<p>Hanoi: French police arrested three Chinese employees of the American Far East Trading Company and the North American Enterprise Federation last night. Although the reason was not explained, it is believed that this arrest is related to the matter of heavily transporting American goods from Haiphong to Manila and Hong Kong. The French side has now requested that Chinese employees of American trading companies not leave Haiphong and has prohibited the re-export of American goods. As a result of 10,000 Japanese troops stationed in Haiphong, American goods stored in nearby warehouses have indeed lost their safety and convenience. At the same time, since the Japanese military demanded the detention of the French-registered "Xijiang" (phonetic) and prohibited the loading and unloading of American goods, the French customs has changed its attitude.

<p>Southern National Capital: Greek Prime Minister Metaxas issued a proclamation to the nation today, stating, in brief, that he regards Italy's ultimatum and its demands as a declaration of war.

<p>Berlin: Italy issued an ultimatum to Greece at 3:00 this morning. Italian troops entered Greece at 6:00 this morning. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: At 3:00 this morning, Italian Ambassador to Greece Grazzi, after handing over the ultimatum, declared that Italian troops would enter Greece at 6:00 a.m. Government ordered a blackout at 4:30 this morning, and then announced national mobilization a few minutes later. The general public knew that a war was inevitable. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Bulgarian Capital: It is confirmed here that there have been incidents on the Greek-Albanian border. There is currently no indication that any German troops have entered Bulgaria. They were very surprised by the news of Italy's ultimatum to Greece. The news came on the eve of the Bulgarian King's speech at the National Assembly, forcefully declaring Bulgaria's independence and neutrality. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Athens: Because Greece rejected the ultimatum, Italian troops began invading Greece at dawn today and have been met with resistance from Greek troops. While Italian troops attacked Greece from the Greek-Albanian border, Italian planes also bombed the Tato Airport in Greek territory, killing four people and injuring forty. The Greek government has not declared war on Italy, but has only announced a state of war similar to martial law. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: London Radio Station announced today that British aid to Greece has British naval forces already on the way. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London: The Greek ambassador to Britain had close contact with the Turkish ambassador to Britain today. The Greek ambassador received the following telegram from Athens: "At 3:00 this morning, the Italian ambassador to Greece personally delivered a note, accusing the Greek government of allowing its territorial waters, coasts, and ports to be used by the British fleet during the war, assisting in the delivery of supplies to the British army, and allowing the organization of military intelligence agencies on the Greek islands that are detrimental to Italy. The Italian government has no choice but to point out to the Greek government that the terrorist policies adopted by Greece towards the people of Tsamouria and the frequent disturbances on the Albanian border are all acts of challenge to Albania. Italy can no longer tolerate this. Greece's neutrality has gradually become a mere formality. Therefore, Italy has decided to ask the Greek government to provide facilities for occupying certain military points in Greek territory during the current period of war against Britain, as a guarantee of Greek neutrality and Italian security. The Italian government asks Greece not to oppose this occupation, not to obstruct the passage of troops performing occupation duties, and demands that the Greek government immediately order its military authorities to facilitate the smooth completion of this occupation. If the Italian army encounters resistance, it will respond with force, and the Greek government will be responsible for all consequences." Greek Prime Minister Metaxas replied that he regarded the contents of this note and its ultimatum nature as nothing less than a declaration of war on Greece. The Italian ambassador then declared that the Italian army's launch would begin at 6:00 this morning. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Athens: It is heard that a total of 20,000 Italian troops have entered Greek territory. Border warfare broke out at 5:30 this morning.

<h3>Greek Government Rejects Italian Ultimatum</h3>
<p>Athens: Greece rejected the Italian proposal for unconditional surrender this morning, and the government immediately mobilized all its troops and issued a public statement strictly defending its determination to defend the territory. According to reports, the Italian note was submitted to Prime Minister Metaxas by the Italian ambassador to Athens at 3:00 a.m., with a three-hour deadline for a reply. The Greek cabinet held an emergency meeting at 5:00 a.m. and decided to reject it and issue an order to mobilize troops. The Prime Minister also stated that the government had replied to Italy's request, stating that "I regard this request and action as a declaration of war." The Prime Minister continued that the Italian ambassador demanded that Greece surrender unconditionally, otherwise Italian troops would enter Greek territory at dusk. It is true that Greece does not have a large number of troops and may be occupied by Italy within a few days without assistance. At present, there is a strong navy stationed in the eastern Mediterranean and has expressed its willingness to guarantee Greece's independence and territorial integrity. The important Greek port of Salonika, which is usually called the key to the Balkans, Italy will undoubtedly seek to occupy it before Britain. It is also clear that whichever party obtains the port of Salonika first, the Greek land will become the site of the Anglo-Italian war. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Turkey Transfers Elite Troops to Northwestern Border</h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital: Border reports between Albania and Italy and Greek armies that conflict has occurred again. The Turkish government, for the sake of being prepared for unforeseen events, has urgently transferred elite detachments to the northwestern border today to reinforce the 500,000 troops already concentrated there. (International dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: According to well-informed sources here, Turkey has sent elite troops to the Thracian region bordering Bulgaria. It is speculated that Turkey is quite afraid that after Italy's advance into Greece, German troops will also pass through Bulgaria and advance towards the Dardanelles and Istanbul. It is reported that large numbers of Soviet tank and artillery units have been concentrated along the Bessarabian-Bukovina border towards the Black Sea, but the Soviet Union's attitude remains a mystery. (International dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Greek Side Denies Border Troops Entering Albanian Territory</h3>
<p>Greek Capital: The Greek semi-official news agency has recently denied the Italian report that an incident occurred on the border between Greece and Albania. According to the report, the Italian Stefani news agency telegraphed from Tirana that Greek armed forces had entered Albanian territory to attack an Albanian military post near Korçë, but this is false. Greek troops have not crossed the Albanian border at any location. Greek military and civilian authorities maintain order, so there is no possibility of vagrants gathering in Greece. As for the Italian report that a bomb exploded at the office of an Italian lieutenant general in Santi Quaranta in Albania, and that the Greek authorities were responsible, it is even more fabricated out of thin air and ridiculous. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Reports of British Fleet Deploying; Will Seize Candia Island</h3>
<p>Southern National Capital: It is rumored here that warfare is already in progress in the border areas between Greece and Albania. The Italian fleet has begun attacking various prefectures, while British warships are sailing to occupy Crete (i.e., Candia), but no reliable news has been received yet. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Swedish Capital: London Radio Station announced this afternoon that British and Italian warships have engaged in naval battles near the Greek prefecture islands. (Haitong Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Greece Mobilizes Nationally; Accepts Italian Challenge</h3>
<p>Athens: Greek King George II and Prime Minister Metaxas announced a general mobilization order today, stating that the Italian ambassador to Greece presented an ultimatum at 3:00 this morning, demanding certain concessionary rights. It is said that the Greek Prime Minister immediately informed the Italian ambassador that the presentation of the ultimatum was tantamount to a declaration of war. Therefore, Greece believes that a state of war exists between Italy and Greece. All armed forces in Greece are on standby today. It is understood that the Greek Navy has begun exercises in the port of Salonika. The Greek Prime Minister is constantly in contact with military authorities. Negotiations between Italy and Greece on the Albanian border have broken down. When the Greek representatives arrived at the border, they saw that the representatives sent by Italy were only a low-ranking adjutant. This proves that the Italian side has no interest in this final negotiation. Therefore, the Greek representatives immediately withdrew, requesting that the meeting be reopened and that Italian military leaders attend. (International dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Athens: The Greek army has a total of 80,000 regular troops, with a potential fighting force of about 100,000. The Air Force originally had ten squadrons, but may have increased recently. The Navy has a total of 613 warships of various types, the main ones being the armored cruiser Averoff, ten destroyers (four of which are new), thirteen torpedo boats, six submarines, and four motor torpedo boats. In August, the Greek cruiser Helli was torpedoed outside the island of Tinos by a submarine of unknown nationality. The Greek merchant fleet has a total of 589 ships, totaling 1,855,000 tons.

<h3>Greek Youth Hold Anti-Italian Demonstrations on Border</h3>
<p>Roman Capital: According to Albanian newspapers, in the past 48 hours, many soldiers carrying rifles have been found in the area near Lake Prespa and Konipol, near the border between Albania and Greece. It is said that six people have penetrated one kilometer into Albanian territory and have been stopped by the customs guard. Hundreds of Greek youths in Kavajë, mainly students from Gjirokastër, held anti-Italian and anti-Albanian demonstrations on the border, holding Greek flags and shouting slogans. It is said that Greece has closed the border, and Albanian farmers have been prevented by Greek police from crossing the border to work in farms in Greece. The newspaper continued that Greek border residents were very excited to hear the news that the Central Army would assist Greece. Yesterday, a plane dropped leaflets in southern Albania, probably a British plane. The newspaper pointed out that border incidents cannot affect Albania, which has taken necessary measures in time to prepare to repel attacks from any direction. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Failed Attack on Egypt Turns to Invading Greece</h3>
<p>According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent in London, Italian forces' attack on Egypt has been unsuccessful, so they are turning to Greece for an easier conquest. The Italians see Greece as having a shorter transportation line and seemingly more geographical advantages than attacking Egypt. Rumors of German troops entering Albania to assist the Italian army are also not entirely impossible. Although the Greek army is not yet fully mobilized, it may perform well against the Italian army fighting with its back to the sea, unless overwhelmed by Italian armored divisions and air force. Its fighting ability is at least equal to, if not surpassing, the Italian army. The Italian decision seems to rely on overwhelming mechanical equipment for victory, but the initial contact point, Epirus, is surrounded by high mountains, which is very conducive to defense. As for Greece seeking British aid to fulfill its guarantee, it is not surprising. British naval and air forces may quickly come to the rescue. From an international perspective, current attention is mainly focused on the Turkish government. Although Turkey may not send troops to aid Greece, if Bulgaria is forced by the Axis powers to seize the opportunity to gain access to the Aegean Sea, Turkey can put pressure on it. From the current situation, Bulgaria seems unwilling to be a pawn of the Axis powers, which is worthy of our attention. Finally, it should be mentioned that the influence of the Soviet Union on Turkey's attitude and activities may be very important. Today's meeting between Hitler and Mussolini in Florence seems to illustrate that Mussolini's decision to attack Greece was made voluntarily, mainly because he was not included in the discussions between Germany and the Vichy government. Therefore, Hitler had to condescend again and travel a long distance to attend the meeting. However, to infer any deterioration in the relationship between the Axis powers from this would be overly sensitive. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Declares Neutrality</h3>
<p>The capital of Yugoslavia announced this morning that Yugoslavia will maintain neutrality in the Italo-Greek war. Yugoslavia deeply regrets the Italo-Greek incident. Yugoslavia has always been willing to mediate to prevent the Balkans from being drawn into the war. Now it can only quietly observe the development of the situation, hoping that Yugoslavia's neutrality will be respected by all parties. Political figures say that according to the Belgrade Agreement signed in 1937, Italy and Yugoslavia stipulated that if Italy took any action against Greece, it should notify Yugoslavia in advance, but Italy has not fulfilled this obligation, so the Yugoslav government knows nothing. Prime Minister Cvetković and Deputy Prime Minister Maček are currently not in the capital. It is reported that the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister will return to the capital this afternoon.

<h3>Greek Dictator Prime Minister Metaxas</h3>
<p>Greece Seeks British Aid, Britain Decides to Fulfill Guarantee Obligations to Greece</p>
<p>London It is heard that the War Cabinet is currently considering Greece's request for aid and is expected to respond soon. There is reason to believe that the details of British assistance in the event of an attack on Greece have been drafted by the British and Greek governments. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London The Greek government's appeal for British aid cannot help but recall the days after Italy invaded Albania. Subsequently, Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons on April 17, 1939, reviewing the situation in the Balkans, stating that the British government attaches great importance to avoiding any disturbances to the status quo in the Mediterranean and Balkan Peninsula caused by force or the threat of force. Therefore, the British government asserted that in the event of any such action that clearly threatened the independence of Greece or Romania, the British government would feel obliged to immediately provide all assistance to the Greek or Romanian governments. Relations between Italy and Greece became tense in August. In early August, the Italians, on the pretext of Greece mistreating Albanians in Himara, launched an anti-Greek campaign in the Italian press and repeatedly spread news of Italian troops concentrating near the Greek border. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London The Foreign Office issued a statement today stating that Greece appealed to the British government for some kind of assistance. According to news received in London, it is confirmed that the Italian Minister in Athens delivered an ultimatum to the Greek government at 2:00 AM this morning, expiring at 5:00 AM. The Greek government has refused it. The Greek Prime Minister informed the Italian Minister that Greece considers this ultimatum tantamount to a declaration of war. The contents of the ultimatum are not yet known here, but it is reported that it demanded the cession of certain military strongholds. The Greek government has appealed to the British government for some kind of assistance. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London According to responsible sources, Britain will fulfill its guarantee to Greece. If hostilities have indeed begun, then Greece may now be considered a co-nation of Britain. According to the terms of Britain's guarantee to Greece, it was announced in the House of Commons on April 13, 1939. The British government has not yet received confirmation that hostilities have begun between Italy and Greece. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Rome It is reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has left here today and is heading north to consult with Marshal Pétain and German leader Hitler in order to formally decide on France's joining the Axis powers. Political circles believe that Italy may revise its peace terms with France in exchange for most of the French fleet, which can enable Italy to cope with the British Mediterranean fleet. Today is the anniversary of the founding of the Italian Fascist Party, and a declaration may be issued stating that the Axis agreement will be extended to France and Spain, and exaggerating the victory of the Fascist masters in all of Western Europe. As for the news that a tripartite meeting between Mussolini, Horthy, and Beneš is about to be held, there is no official confirmation at this time. It is believed that if this meeting is held, General Franco will also participate. The meeting place is probably in the French region of Lirone, occupied by Italy. Vichy sources said today that French Deputy Prime Minister Laval will arrive in Paris tonight to make an important announcement to the French and German press. As for the whereabouts of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, it is said that the German side is still keeping it secret. (International News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Florence Italian sources say that the reason why Florence was chosen as the meeting place for the leaders of Germany and Italy is that Hitler mentioned that when he reciprocated a visit to Florence in 1938, he was extremely admired for the city's artistic treasures. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Rome Yesterday was the 19th anniversary of the Fascist army's entry into Rome. Celebrations were held in the past, but yesterday, due to special circumstances, the celebrations were canceled.

<h3>Gibraltar to Become Target of German and Italian Attack, Consequences of German-French Agreement</h3>
<p>Zurich Political observers here predict that the German side will launch new military actions immediately after Pétain and Hitler reach an agreement. This can be evidenced by the Italian newspapers' prediction that there will be action in the Eastern Mediterranean soon. Critics in Switzerland point out that Gibraltar will be the target of the Axis powers' next attack. At the same time, diplomatic observers here believe that the Vichy government's silence on the proposals made by the German side is of great significance and feel that the Vichy government wants to present the fait accompli to the French people without disclosing the terms of the agreement in advance. People here believe that Pétain held a cabinet meeting in Vichy before accepting the German conditions, which shows that Pétain must first overcome strong opposition within the government. The resignation of Vichy Foreign Minister Baudouin is a sign that Baudouin is unwilling to bear the responsibility for damaging relations between France and the United States. People here do not believe that Pétain has allowed the French army to actively participate in the war against Britain, but believe that Hitler may have obtained strategically important concessions from the French side to conduct the war in the Mediterranean. According to indirect news received here, although the French people are eager for British victory, one thing to note is that France has now become an autocratic country and Deputy Prime Minister Laval has taken over all power. Regarding Spain, the diplomatic community here believes that General Franco does not want his country to be involved in the war, but if faced with the choice of automatically or passively allowing German troops to pass through Spain, Franco may be unable to resist.

<h3>British King Sends Warning Telegram to Pétain, French Authorities Secretly Do Not Publish It</h3>
<p>The official authorities here are still keeping secret the telegram sent by British King George VI to Marshal Pétain, but anti-government factions continue to discuss it, claiming that the telegram must be made public so that the French people can learn its contents before discussing cooperation with Germany. Only Pétain and Laval, as well as two other cabinet members, know about the British King's telegram. It is said that the telegram was drafted by Churchill and stated that if France hands over its fleet and military ports to the Axis powers, the guarantees provided by Britain to France will be void. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>

The skies over the outskirts of London were filled with stubborn Nazi iron crows, attacking the capital fiercely. However, last night, the sky was completely dark, with only the faint light of anti-aircraft fire defending the capital in the distance. From dawn to dusk, British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters were active in the sky, without a moment's rest, to defend against wave after wave of Nazi aircraft flying from high altitudes and invading coastal areas. (United Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin Several German light bombers continued to attack military targets in London and southeastern England yesterday. According to official sources, German aircraft hit a British air force ammunition depot and a power plant. When German aircraft crossed the London air defense line, they engaged in fierce battles with British destroyers, shooting down eight British aircraft. Five German aircraft did not return. It is reported that German aircraft bombed London from the 26th to the 17th, causing fires everywhere, and Kensington and Cricklewood suffered significant losses. (Haitong dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London The German air force attacked the British Isles yesterday, losing eight aircraft. The British side also lost six fighter aircraft, but one pilot was unharmed. An Air Ministry communiqué last night stated that German fighters and fighter-bombers flew across the coast in formation towards London and were intercepted by British aircraft and anti-aircraft defenses. Few actually reached London. Bombs fell in the London area and several locations in eastern England, damaging houses and other buildings in several locations, but casualties were reported to be light. Hampshire was also attacked in the afternoon, with several bombs falling in the area, damaging several houses and injuring several people. It is confirmed that two other enemy aircraft were destroyed on Friday and Saturday. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London In the early hours of this morning, German bombers launched another night of terror attacks on the British Isles, sweeping across the Midlands and London, and reaching Liverpool and the northwest. Incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs were dropped everywhere on the three islands. During the air raids, the London anti-aircraft artillery fought tirelessly to stop them, but German aircraft were still able to drop countless bombs on London, causing several more fires. Liverpool suffered heavy losses and many casualties. German aircraft encountered less difficulty in breaking through the air defenses in that area. There are several fires in Liverpool this morning. Several towns were bombed in the East Anglia police district and along the River Mersey. British military authorities have been strengthening London's air defenses due to the continued intensity of German attacks on the British Isles. New anti-aircraft positions have been added to key points in the city. According to well-informed sources, the British have completed "a real weapon to defend against night raids." This weapon has not yet been used or shown to anyone. The authorities are currently keeping this new weapon secret. London believes that the reason why German bombers have flown through the Thames Estuary to reach British soil in the past few days is proof that the Germans are only using German and Dutch bases. People here believe that Germany's bases in France and Belgium have been destroyed by the British Air Force. The German long-range artillery bombardment of Dover has ceased. People here also believe that this is very important. (International News Agency)</p>
<p>London According to a communiqué from the Air Ministry, the activity of enemy aircraft over Britain on Sunday night was less intense than the previous night.

<h3>German Military Report</h3>
<p>Berlin This afternoon's German military report stated that the British ship "Empress of Britain," which was bombed by German aircraft the day before, was finally sunk by a German submarine. At that time, there were not only patrol boats but also destroyers near the ship, but the commander of the German submarine, Yenish, was able to overcome difficulties and defeat the enemy, which is truly commendable. German light bombers carried out retaliatory bombing of London, destroying several airfields near London. Several aircraft parked at an airfield in Scotland were also destroyed. North of Liverpool, German aircraft flew directly at low altitude and dropped bombs on arsenals, hitting several targets. A railway station in York was destroyed by bombs. 300 kilometers northwest of Ireland, a British convoy was bombed by German aircraft, and two cargo ships with a load of about 8,000 tons were hit.

<h3>Male and Female Marriage Guidance</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Secrets to Finding a Happy Spouse</p>
<p>Marriage is the most important issue in life; and in an era of conflict and transition between old and new ideas, this marriage issue has become even more complex and serious, and it is a problem that young people urgently need to solve. Young people often cry out in pain and distress, and although the reasons for this vary, it is feared that many are related to the unsatisfactory resolution of marriage issues. Those who initiate marriage are motivated by love, but the driving force of this love is only "beauty." So it can also be said that the first criterion for choosing a spouse is "beauty." But mentioning "beauty" easily makes people think of outward appearance, and it is indeed common for people to use "appearance" as the standard for choosing a spouse, which is actually a mistake. Beauty should be focused on reproductive instincts to achieve infinite happiness.</p>
<p>If we do not seek happiness in marriage, then so be it, but if we want to enjoy this happiness, we must protect the reproductive function, the source of this happiness. First, men must remain chaste before marriage, and self-indulgence should be stopped quickly. If you only care about the present, then premature ejaculation, impotence, reproductive failure, neurasthenia, and other symptoms will arise, and from then on, you will not be able to fully coordinate with your wife, and sweet dreams will be difficult to achieve. With the advancement of medicine, a male "Bǔ Tǐ Kāng" preparation made from the essence of strong animal testicles has been invented for this disease. It guarantees mental clarity, energetic spirit, rosy complexion, increased appetite, and very healthy sexual function after taking it. There are absolutely no symptoms of premature ejaculation or impotence, and it can also promote reproductive function and help the development of sexual organs. This preparation has been praised by countless Chinese and foreign doctors and is happy to be introduced to couples whose love has faded. Therefore, to save a bad marriage, only increasing "Bǔ Tǐ Kāng" can grant it. For women, it also has the function of regulating menstruation and seeds, and relieving frigidity.</p>
<h3>Youth and Vigor: Not a Time for Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Medical Doctor of Germany</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "If you don't work hard in your youth, you'll only grieve in old age." Judging from this, if we want lifelong happiness, we should strive in our youth. However, young people today often wither before they age. There's no other reason for this than excessive sexual desire, the habit of self-abuse, leading to frequent seminal emission and depletion of kidney energy. Seminal fluid, aside from procreation, is also sufficient to maintain nerve excitement. Therefore, the extreme fatigue after ejaculation is due to the reduction of nutrients that maintain excitement. In people who suffer from seminal emission, this kind of nutrient is further reduced, and nerves show signs of weakness. Common symptoms include insomnia, heavy head, dizziness, memory decline, palpitations, loss of appetite, and over time, muscle wasting and shortened lifespan.</p>
<p>However, even if excessive self-blame leads to seminal emission, if one can recognize the harm and abstain early, all ills can be avoided. Local cold water friction, along with German-made "Ners Seminal Emission Tablets," can stop seminal emission. Furthermore, "Ners Seminal Emission Tablets" also have the effect of calming brain nerves, a blessing for those suffering from insomnia and forgetfulness, with remarkable results.</p>

<h3>Prominent American Businessman Returns to Shanghai, Discusses U.S. Active Aid to Britain. Aiding Britain is Equivalent to Self-Defense. Roosevelt Will Surely Be Re-elected in This Election.</h3>
<p>Mr. [Name], a prominent American businessman and manager of an American tobacco company in this city, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge steamship on the 23rd. He highly praised President Roosevelt's leadership abilities. He declared to reporters that the United States is now virtually involved in the European war. The United States is transporting all war necessities to Britain as much as possible. Ninety percent of the American people agree with President Roosevelt's transfer of fifty old-style destroyers to Britain in exchange for more bases for use by the U.S. Navy. No one criticizes this action.</p>
<p>Aiding Britain is No Different from Helping Oneself</p>
<p>Mr. [Name] firmly believes that if the Royal Air Force needs a "Flying Fortress," it can be obtained immediately. Americans deeply know that the fate of the United States and the entire world seems to be tied to the final outcome of the European war. Therefore, they are now demanding that Britain be given all possible assistance except for participation in the war. Mr. [Name] has visited fifteen of the largest cities in the United States and has seen that people everywhere are united in defending their country. The Americans he spoke with all feel that the British Isles are the first line of defense for the United States. People in New York and along the Atlantic coast are even more determined to aid Britain because they deeply know that they will be the first to be attacked if the American coast is attacked.</p>
<p>Roosevelt is Destined to be Re-elected</p>
<p>On the fifth of next month, the American people will participate in voting to elect President Roosevelt for re-election. Mr. [Name] has many friends who belong to the Wilkie faction, but they advise him to "bet" on Roosevelt because they also firmly believe that Roosevelt will continue to be the master of the White House. The majority of voters in the country have decided to elect Roosevelt for re-election because, at this critical juncture, it is better to elect an experienced hand to lead the country than to choose a new person. Wilkie's foreign policy coincides with Roosevelt's, so Wilkie's campaign is now focused on domestic affairs. However, at the moment, the American people prioritize foreign policy, and domestic issues can be temporarily put aside.</p>
<p>Wilkie Will Hardly Win</p>
<p>In his opinion, although the American newspapers are heavily laden with Wilkie's campaign speeches on the front page, Wilkie's campaign will probably not be successful. Wilkie admits that he does not oppose the current government's policies, but he also believes that he can lead this policy even better than Roosevelt. Wilkie is indeed a successful businessman, but the American people do not believe that a successful businessman is necessarily a good politician. Mr. [Name] said that the United States is experiencing a booming economy because of the great national defense plan that is underway, and the number of unemployed has greatly decreased. Skilled workers and artisans are greatly needed. The United States is now training a large number of talents to take on important positions in various munitions factories.</p>
<p>American Women in Shanghai to Elect President</p>
<p>According to a statement yesterday from the American Association of University Women in this city, the members of the association will vote in Shanghai one week before the presidential election begins in their home country. The association's regular monthly meeting has decided to hold the election on the 31st of this month (Thursday) at 4:00 PM. At that time, the presidential election will be a part of the general meeting's program. In addition, the general meeting also plans to discuss scholarship matters. This scholarship will be awarded to a senior female student at the American School before the end of the fall semester. Therefore, all members are urged to generously contribute funds for the award. It is said that most of the American women in this city will attend the meeting.</p>
<h3>Newly Recruited Soldiers Sent to the Front Lines Near Shanghai Mostly Died in Vain, Only a Few Hundred Remain From More Than a Thousand</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous troops from suburban areas near Shanghai, such as Songjiang, Qingpu, Fengxian, Chuansha, and Nanhui counties, were gathered by the Japanese army at the beginning of last month, numbering 1,500. They were concentrated in Songjiang for reorganization and then escorted to the front lines on the south bank of the Qiantang River to fight. It is now known that when these miscellaneous troops were forced to fight in the Zhuji area, they were easily defeated. Most of these 1,500 miscellaneous troops died in vain on the front lines. Only a few hundred remain.</p>
<h3>American Chamber of Commerce and Other Public Organizations Host Banquet to Welcome New Consul and See Off Departing Consul</h3>
<p>The new U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Locke H. Head, arrived in Shanghai on the President Coolidge steamship of the American President Lines on the 23rd of this month. He held his inauguration ceremony at the Consulate on Jiangxi Road at 9:00 AM on the 24th. The original Acting Consul, Mr. Baderick, has completed the transfer of all files and responsibilities to the incoming Consul. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the President Pierce steamship on November 1st to return to the United States and assume a new position. The American Association and the American Chamber of Commerce in this city, in order to welcome the new Consul to Shanghai and bid farewell to the Acting Consul, have decided to host a banquet at the American Association this Thursday (the 31st) to show their farewell. At that time, the streets will be crowded with cars and horses, and it will surely be a grand occasion.</p>
<p>A Sneak Preview of the Xin Xin Beauty Salon, Which Will Soon Open and Take the Lead in the Far East. A Journalist's Tour of the Facility, Which Cost Over Ten Thousand Yuan to Build and Is Truly One-of-a-Kind in Shanghai, Featuring Scientific Power and Mechanical Equipment. Beauty Authority.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch) In the winter of 1940, Shanghai will once again be excited and stimulated by a new business that dominates the Far East: the opening of the Xin Xin Beauty Salon, the first palace of hairdressing in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Xin Xin Beauty Salon is another amazing contribution from the Xin Xin Company after the New Capital Hotel. It resolutely sacrificed a large area at the corner of the hotel's entrance, sparing no effort to utilize the brains of designers. In just two short months, thanks to superior and substantial economic conditions, the old Xin Xin Beauty Salon was completely renovated and transformed into a radiant new appearance.</p>
<p>Let me give a simple report of my impressions from the tour here as a congratulatory gift for its opening.</p>
<p>In terms of its form, the Xin Xin Beauty Salon is divided into two floors. The entrance is on Guizhou Road. At the entrance is a "Xin Xin style" sample room, decorated with magnificent neon lights. This sample is uniquely created by famous Austrian beauticians every week, publicly displayed and exhibited for Shanghai ladies to refer to, study, and adopt. In the summer, there is standard air conditioning, and in the winter, there is warm air. This is the first time a Shanghai barbershop has provided this kind of service to its customers.</p>
<p>Upon entering, the ground floor is completely painted in milky white. Soft lights are reflected from the reflector lamps, which can protect the eyes and physical and mental feelings of those resting and beautifying for a long time. The "Innocent Love" rubber carpet on the floor absorbs all the sound waves of dozens of people, making it silent. This noble and quiet paradise is the best place for ladies to prepare before attending banquets and social events.</p>
<p>On the second floor, the color of emerald green refreshes the eyes of the guests. A smiling goddess in white brings you to the three-dimensional hairdressing palace, equipped with the latest and most luxurious crystal long-bulb electric lights from the United States. The amazing equipment shocks every lady with the authority of modern science and mechanical tools.</p>
<p>What's particularly interesting is that ladies, whether sitting or lying down, can chat with anyone on the phone without having to move. Entrepreneurs can handle office matters as usual while getting a haircut. Pretty ladies can also chat intimately with young gentlemen while getting their hair done.</p>
<p>Thus, first-class hairdressers have been gathered here. Moreover, the company authorities, who value the hairdressing salon, have strictly proposed that they must undergo three weeks of special training in advance. Therefore, after being trained in the service spirit and technology of Austrian beauty experts, they are no longer ordinary or even "white angels" that can be found in China.</p>
<p>Of particular importance is a brave and great immortal attempt. The Xin Xin Beauty Salon has specially spent a huge sum of U.S. dollars to order the latest invented automatic insurance electric unit for cold air and warm air from New York, USA, for exclusive use in the Far East. This machine is the latest invention in the United States and is being used for the first time in the Far East. It is warm in the winter and cool in the summer, a scientific miracle, and automatically insured for absolute safety.</p>
<p>In the service of the hairdressing salon, there is also something worth introducing, which is the attention to hygiene and disinfection. Not only are there two dedicated ladies specializing in the disinfection of utensils, but also everyone can register their own specially numbered towel for disinfection and preservation. If calculated at twelve hours of work per day, with thirty-two people getting their hair done per hour, three hundred and eighty-four towels are needed per day, and eleven thousand five hundred and twenty towels are needed per month. If calculated at one yuan per towel, the Xin Xin Beauty Salon sacrifices over ten thousand yuan per month for towels to serve its customers. Furthermore, even combs are disinfected immediately after being used by customers and wrapped in paper bags to show distinction. This shows how luxurious and noble the Xin Xin Beauty Salon is.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Shaoxing Surrounded by Chinese Troops, Annihilation Expected</h3>
<p>Japanese troops stationed in Xiaoshan, including the Sasaki, Koga, Kumazaki, and Ito units, occupied Zhuji on the 23rd and invaded Shaoxing the following morning. On the 25th, they were intercepted by Chinese troops in the suburbs of Shaoxing, resulting in fierce fighting with heavy casualties on the Japanese side. The Chinese troops, having achieved their goal of attrition warfare, shifted their positions in the afternoon of the same day. As a result, on the afternoon of the 26th, more than a hundred Japanese troops entered the city through the east gate and engaged in fierce street fighting with the defending troops in the city. The fighting is still ongoing. A major fire broke out in the city. Fresh Chinese troops are continuously arriving and establishing strong defensive positions, intending to completely annihilate the Japanese troops. The Ningbo area, including Shangyu and Yuyao, is peaceful, but the Japanese may bomb Baiguan and Cao'e.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Counterattack Hangzhou</p>
<p>According to sources from Hangzhou, since the Japanese troops in eastern Zhejiang occupied Zhuji on the 23rd, the Chinese military authorities stationed in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou have begun using flexible and elusive guerrilla tactics to counterattack Hangzhou starting on the 25th in order to contain the Japanese troops' rear. The Japanese troops in the city are panicking, and a fierce battle is about to begin.</p>
<p>Postal and Telegraphic Communications Between Shanghai and Shaoxing Interrupted</p>
<p>Regarding postal and telegraphic communications between Shanghai and Shaoxing, a reporter from the Da Guang News Agency learned from the transportation section of the Shanghai Postal Administration that the Shanghai Post Office is still receiving letters and money orders as usual, but there is no guarantee that they will arrive. As for telegrams between Shanghai and Shaoxing, the American Commercial Communications Agency in Shanghai has stopped sending and receiving them since the previous day. The Great Eastern Telegraph Office has also stopped sending telegrams since yesterday. All banks and money shops in this city that handle Shanghai-Shaoxing money transfers have also stopped issuing Shaoxing money orders since yesterday.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Are Weak</p>
<p>Keqiao, which is 30 li from the county seat of Shaoxing, has also been infiltrated by small groups of Japanese troops, who are entrenched in the Keyan area. Therefore, the local situation is chaotic. However, the Japanese troops roaming in Shaoxing are abnormally weak, and their annihilation is imminent. According to observations by those familiar with the terrain of Zhejiang and Shaoxing in this city, the Japanese troops were able to enter Shaoxing this time entirely because of their mechanized units, as the terrain north of Shaoxing is very flat. This spring, the Japanese troops also briefly infiltrated the suburbs but retreated to Xiaoshan without turning around. However, to the south of Shaoxing, the terrain is mountainous and rugged, and the people are fierce and willing to fight. It is difficult for the Japanese troops to continue advancing south. The purpose of the Japanese troops' southward invasion this time is only to contain the Chinese troops' forces in eastern Zhejiang and does not need to be given much importance.</p>
<h3>Small Parcel Post Must Also Be Inspected with a Permit</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice stating that the various items listed in Notice No. 1626 of this bureau on the 18th of this month, if sent in small parcels, will be handled in the same way as if they were sent in packages. That is, if there is no permit issued by a local Shanghai agency for inspection, this bureau will not accept them. This is hereby notified so that everyone is aware.</p>
<h3>Czechs in Shanghai Celebrate National Day, Pray for Liberation of the Motherland. Grand Flag-Raising Ceremony Held Yesterday Morning. Czech Association Issues Heartfelt Declaration.</h3>
<p>About sixty Czech expatriates in Shanghai gathered at 8:20 AM yesterday (the 28th) on the lawn of the Czech Association at 124 Albert Road to participate in a simple and solemn flag-raising ceremony to commemorate Czech National Day. At the beginning of the ceremony, Mr. Stephen, Honorary Secretary-General of the Czech Association, gave a speech, emphasizing the importance of National Day and that all Czech expatriates in Shanghai must unite and work together. A team of Czech scouts, wearing Czech folk costumes, also participated in the flag-raising ceremony, adding a lot of color. Yesterday afternoon from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, and starting at 8:00 PM, the China Press wireless station broadcast a special program, broadcasting the Czech national anthem and famous works by Czech composers. Last night at 9:00 PM, there was an appropriate commemoration at the Czech Association, with Mr. Stephen giving an encouraging speech and musical performances such as singing.</p>
<h3>Declaration Issued, Wishing Victory</h3>
<p>The Czech Expatriate Association issued a heartfelt declaration yesterday, saying, "Today, 1.5 billion Czechs commemorate the twelfth week of their independence. Three hundred years after the Czech Republic perished, it finally regained its independence and freedom in 1918. However, the new Czech Republic only survived for a very short twenty years. During this very short life, the Czech Republic was the most developed, most democratic, and most politically free country in Europe. Subsequently, the rise of Hitler's power created the darkest era in Czech history. The Munich Agreement of 1938 destroyed the prosperous Czech Republic, and in March 1939, the National Socialist Party violated its promise, invaded and occupied the remaining territory of the Czech Republic, and the Czech Republic perished. What followed was an era of humiliation, oppression, looting, and massacre. Today, 1.5 billion Czech people celebrate their National Day together. Those who live in the Czech homeland, under the oppression of the National Socialist Party and the secret police, are not allowed to hold meetings to commemorate it. They can only commemorate this holiday in their hearts. Last year on this day, hundreds of students were killed, hundreds were tortured, and thousands were imprisoned in concentration camps because they had commemorated National Day. For this reason, all Czech universities and other higher schools were ordered by the National Socialist Party to be closed for three years. However, the National Socialist Party's terroristic actions cannot stop the Czechs from praying for the victory of the Allies and the liberation of their motherland. Five hundred million Czech expatriates living abroad will commemorate this day with solemn ceremonies. They sympathize with their compatriots who are oppressed in their homeland and at the same time strive for the revival of the Czech Republic, and the Czech army also cherishes this aspiration in their hearts, fighting alongside the Allies and other armies resisting the National Socialist Party."</p>
<h3>U.S. Transport Ship USS Gold Star Sailed to Shanghai Yesterday, Will Leave for North China Soon</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury*, the USS Gold Star, a supply ship of the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Shanghai from Guam Island early this morning (the 28th). U.S. Navy officers here stated that the ship's arrival in Shanghai is purely a routine trip. The rumor that the ship will carry the families of U.S. Navy personnel in this city is not true. The USS Gold Star will stay in Shanghai for several days and then may sail to North China, but the sailing schedule has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>French Ship to Shanghai Defense Line Begins to Take Passengers</h3>
<p>The French postal company’s steamship *Da Da Nan*, which recently joined the Shanghai defense line, will arrive in Shanghai from Manila and Saigon this Wednesday (the 30th) at 1:00 PM and dock at the Dongchang Road Wharf. After staying in Shanghai, it is scheduled to sail to Kobe, Japan, early this Friday, and from Kobe directly to Little Luzon, and then return to Shanghai (round trips from Hong Kong are not included) to return to the defense line. Subsequently, the ship will sail on a new route. The company has already started selling tickets and carrying goods. Furthermore, the *Kim Dinh* steamship will sail to various ports in Vietnam tomorrow.</p>
<h3>White Russians Fear Japanese Retaliation, Anxious and Afraid, Plan to Form Another Committee, but Are Rejected by the Japanese</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, several people who claimed to be representatives of White Russian expatriates applied to the Japanese authorities last week, requesting to form another independent White Russian committee directly under the "Pseudo Government." It is understood that this application has been disapproved by the Japanese military's Special Affairs Department. It is found that the White Russian expatriates in this city are those who sought refuge in Shanghai after the revolution in Russia, with a total of more than 6,000 people. They have been under the jurisdiction of the White Russian Expatriate Committee. In the past few years, the late Chairman of the former Committee, Mr. Metzler (who was assassinated), had provided a lot of help to these White Russian expatriates. When the Chinese government was in Nanjing three years ago, it did not recognize these Russian expatriates. According to reliable sources, the motivation for some White Russian expatriate representatives to apply to form another committee this time is because they fear Japanese retaliation, just like the fate of their compatriots in Harbin and Tianjin. Although this request has been rejected by the Japanese authorities, it is understood that these Russian expatriates may reapply.</p>
<h3>National Comforting Association Issues Shanghai Comfort Money Donation Methods. Donations Remitted Must Be Accompanied by a Letter of Explanation, Stating the Nature of the Donation and the Intended Use</h3>
<p>The National Comforting Association believes that since the start of the war of resistance, compatriots at home and abroad have generously donated money and actively contributed. However, the procedures for donating money are still too simple, which has caused difficulties in handling. For example, if the donation is remitted from a bank, it is neither marked as a comfort donation nor does it indicate whether it is an individual donation or a group fundraising, which makes it impossible for the association to keep accounts, and often requires multiple inquiries, wasting time. A correction method has been formulated to facilitate investigation and benefit success. The various circles in Shanghai have now received the following methods: (1) When donating money from the bank, please provide a separate letter of explanation. (2) In the letter, please state the nature of the donation and whether it is designated for a specific purpose. (3) Please indicate in the letter whether the funds are individual donations, group donations, or fundraising income. (4) If receipts need to be issued separately, please attach a detailed list of donors. (5) If it is designated to be delivered to a certain person in the front line, please also explain in detail.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Detains Vessel, Arbitrarily Illegally Searching and Inspecting. Upon Boarding, Radio Communications Ceased Immediately. Passengers Were Intimidated With Guns While Moving to Different Places.</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury*, the *Mingsheng* steamship of Jardine Matheson, which came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, was blocked by a Japanese destroyer five or six hundred miles south of Shanghai Port, causing a delay of one day. It was not until yesterday (the 27th) that it arrived here. Passengers on the ship have vividly recounted the scene of Japanese Navy soldiers roaming the entire ship with guns.</p>
<p>Abrupt Action, No Results</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for Japanese naval ships to search. The interception of the *Mingsheng* is just one example. However, the Japanese interception of the ship seemed rather abrupt in some respects, and the search yielded no results, merely preventing the ship from arriving here on schedule on Saturday evening.</p>
<p>Opening Fire to Force Stop, Boarding for Search</p>
<p>According to passengers, at about 6:00 PM on Friday afternoon, as the *Mingsheng* was sailing forward, a Japanese destroyer suddenly approached and fired a shot to order the *Mingsheng* to stop. It then sent a flashing signal and dispatched twelve officers and soldiers by boat to board the ship. They immediately took action to disable the *Mingsheng*'s radio, preventing the ship from communicating with the shore or other ships.</p>
<p>Intimidating Passengers With Guns, Taking Items at Will</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers then roamed the entire ship with handguns, intimidating passengers and taking items for inspection at will, often without any specific purpose. The officers leading the Japanese soldiers demanded that the captain of the *Mingsheng* allow them to interrogate all Chinese passengers. Although rejected, they forcibly questioned one or two Chinese people. The Japanese soldiers also searched one or two cabins randomly. The Japanese soldiers' search of the entire ship had no clear target and yielded no results.</p>
<p>Harassment Lasting Over an Hour</p>
<p>It is reported that Japanese soldiers had disputes with the ship's senior officers over certain points, such as wanting to enter the chart room. Although the crew did not resist, they firmly requested that the Japanese soldiers proceed according to established procedures. The Japanese naval officers and soldiers harassed the ship for more than an hour before leaving and allowing the *Mingsheng* to continue its voyage.</p>
<h3>Passengers to Hong Kong Must Obtain a Epidemic Prevention Certificate</h3>
<p>The Chinese Shipping Department of the Taikoo Steamship Company in this city notified passengers that "The Hong Kong government now orders that passengers to Hong Kong must be injected with epidemic prevention vaccine and vaccinated against smallpox at the Health Department of the British Public Works Department or the French Public Works Department to obtain a certificate, and a photo must be attached before they are allowed to land. However, if you obtain a certificate from the Jianghai Customs Quarantine Office, a photo is not required. This is a notice."</p>
<h3>Commercial Banks Reduce Interest on Current Accounts: Not a Public Meeting Decision; Member Banks Unilaterally Reduce Interest by One Percent; Cannot Serve as Basis for Deposit Interest Rate Reduction; Savings Deposit Interest Rates of the Four Banks and Others Specially Increased</h3>
<p>The Four Banks of China, Central, Communications, Agriculture, and China Farmer's Bank, in accordance with ministry orders, absorb idle funds, promote savings, channel idle funds into the mainstream for national use, cultivate a thrifty spirit and good habits, and widely establish simple savings offices. They stipulate that the interest rate for absorbing savings deposits should generally be 5% per week for current accounts and 1% per week for one-year fixed deposits. They may also appropriately increase or decrease the rates based on local conditions, without being restricted by general savings regulations. All facilities should be as simple as possible, all expenses must be economical, procedures should be as convenient as possible. In addition to paying special attention to attracting small deposits, they will also promote national construction savings, savings bonds, prize savings, etc.</p>
<p>Interest Rate Reduction Cannot Reduce the Crisis</p>
<p>Since Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai, Guohua, as well as Continental, Zhongnan, Yanye, Jin Cheng, and other banks have successively reduced interest rates on current deposits by one percent, with the aim of reducing the burden on interest expenses, it is actually due to the excessive deposits of various commercial banks, which they are unable to utilize. Reducing deposit interest rates is beneficial to commercial banks. For example, reducing the interest rate on 10 million yuan in deposits by one percent can save 100,000 yuan in interest annually. However, most banks believe that reducing interest rates will not only fail to resolve the current banking crisis but will also affect the psychology of depositors, causing funds to flow into speculation. Therefore, the interest rate reduction by various commercial banks is done autonomously by each commercial bank and was not decided by a public meeting of the banking industry.</p>
<p>Bank Association Changes Interest Rates: Entirely Internal</p>
<p>Regarding the Shanghai Bank Joint Reserve Committee's announcement that the interest rate on national currency (i.e., "劃頭") deposits for member banks will be reduced from 3% to 2% starting November 1st, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired with the banking sector yesterday. The interest rate on national currency current accounts of the Bank Joint Reserve Committee was originally 1.5% before August 13th. It was then raised to 2% to prevent the flight of funds from Shanghai, and later raised again to 3%. This notification of a change to 2% is still half a percent higher than before the war. This is entirely a measure for member banks and has nothing to do with the outside world. It should not be regarded as a general interest rate reduction in Shanghai. At the same time, each bank must not use the association's interest rate change as a basis for reducing interest rates for depositors. It is also reported that banks are implementing plans to transfer surplus funds inland, establishing branches in the interior and organizing banking groups to directly invest in the interior. They declined to comment on the interest rate reduction by some commercial banks. Individual parcels from the Dingshan Bureau in Jiangsu Province and the agency offices in Shushan Town and Hu　Town affiliated with the bureau should be temporarily suspended from acceptance. Parcels and large quantities of small packages from the Jianqiao Town and Hancheng bureaus in Hebei Province, as well as large quantities of collect-on-delivery parcels sent to the Youfang Town Bureau, should be temporarily suspended from acceptance.</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver Exports by the End of September Were All Shipped Abroad from the Southwest</h3>

<h3>The Japanese Blockaded Western Shanghai Again; American Troops Implemented Martial Law; Withdrew After About an Hour; Residents in the Blockaded Area Suffered Greatly</h3>
<p>The U.S. Defense Force stationed in Shanghai suddenly implemented special martial law in the defense zone starting at 9:00 AM yesterday, dispatching patrols everywhere and setting up small cannons and machine guns at key intersections such as Xiaoshadu Road, Gordon Road, Hart Road, and Avenue Road. The situation was very tense for a while, and they only withdrew after about an hour.</p>
<p>U.S. Troops Patrol the Defense Zone</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that the two alleys of Jessfield Road in western Shanghai are still being "blockaded" by the Japanese today (28th), causing many Chinese residents in the alleys to continue to suffer. At the same time, the Fourth Marine Regiment of the U.S. Navy stationed in Shanghai took precautions in the U.S. military zone west of the International Settlement this morning, dispatching machine gun squads and several patrols to patrol. However, there is no official news available regarding the activities of the U.S. military this morning.</p>
<p>Residents of Two Alleys Suffer Again</p>
<p>It is reported that Chinese residents in the two alleys blockaded on Jessfield Road must purchase special "passes" from the Japanese puppet authorities in the area for two yuan per person. Although residents are on the verge of despair, there are still many who do not dare to leave their homes. As for the number of residents who have starved to death in the week after the Japanese authorities implemented the blockade in the area, there is still no confirmed news. Reliable sources say that about eight residents have starved to death in the past week.</p>

<h3>Father Yau Flies to San Francisco, Transfers to Various Parts of the United States; Dr. Baker Goes to Chongqing via Hong Kong, Will Go to Burma to Handle Drug Transportation</h3>
<p>According to news from the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association at 97 Nanking Road, Father Yau Ka-kui, the chairman of the association and founder of the Nanshi Refugee Area, returned to China by ship in June this year after the European war intensified, intending to engage in relief work for refugees in his motherland. However, in the middle of the journey, the European situation changed, and France and Germany signed a peace agreement. Yau stayed in Hong Kong for four months. It is now learned that Yau took a ship to Little Luzon at the beginning of this month, and then took a Clipper flying boat to the United States, arriving in San Francisco a few days ago. After staying for a few days, he will transfer to various parts of the United States to solicit donations for Chinese refugees along the way. The association has no way of knowing the details. Previously, Yau had once traveled to various parts of the United States and raised one million U.S. dollars for Chinese refugees. After returning to China, he consulted with the Chongqing government on the distribution of the donations.</p>
<p>Baker Returns to China to Continue Work</p>
<p>Also, the general manager of the association and general of the Shanghai International Red Cross, the American Dr.</p>
<p>Baker has been in China for more than 20 years, managing various charitable undertakings. After the Shanghai war, he was responsible for relief work for refugees in China and achieved remarkable results. Baker left Shanghai for the United States on November 21st of last year, repeatedly promoting donations to aid Chinese refugees in the United States. He was very concerned about Chinese wounded soldiers and called on the American people to step up medical assistance. It is now learned that Baker arrived in Manila on the Clipper flying boat from Honolulu on the 8th of this month and transferred to Hong Kong. From Hong Kong, he will go to Chongqing to meet with government authorities and then to Kunming and Burma to handle the transfer of drugs from the United States to China.</p>

<h3>Rong Wenhao and Wife Have a Bad Relationship; Wife Files for Divorce and Seeks Alimony of 50,000 National Currency</h3>
<p>Li Xiaoyun, a local woman and graduate of the School of Law and Politics, age 32, married Rong Wenhao, age 36 (the owner of Rong Wenji Construction Company on Julaida Road), the nephew of Rong Zongjing, a major flour merchant from Wuxi, through a matchmaker on September 11th of the 17th year of the Republic of China. The relationship between the couple was initially harmonious, but later, Rong became enamored with the beauty of Ying Yanxiu, Li's cousin,</p>
<p>Inducing Adultery</p>
<p>Afterward, his feelings for his wife suddenly</p>
<p>Became cold as ice. Later, after Li discovered her husband's secret affair, she asked her cousin, Yu Weixuan, to catch them in the act. At that time, Rong voluntarily wrote an agreement to compensate Yu 10,000 yuan in damages, paying 8,000 yuan on the spot, with the remaining 2,000 yuan guaranteed by Li, to be paid within a time limit. Afterward, Rong and Ying continued their cohabitation. In May of the 21st year of the Republic of China, in order to maintain his relationship with Li, he commissioned lawyer Zhu Zhenlu to</p>
<p>Provide Proof and Write an Agreement</p>
<p>Stating that if he were to abandon her, he would</p>
<p>Willingly pay Li 50,000 yuan in alimony. Subsequently, in June of the same year, Rong suddenly wrote a suicide note to Li, stating that "life is uninteresting, and I have gone to Wusongkou to drown myself." After receiving the letter, Li tried her best to investigate and learned that her husband and Ying had already been living together in Ningbo. Rong was also working as the manager of the Lixing Tobacco Company in Ningbo. Li then rushed to Ningbo and reported the adultery to the police station, which can be verified. From then on, the relationship between the couple</p>
<p>Became Even Worse</p>
<p>In the 27th year of the Republic of China, Li</p>
<p>For the sake of her future happiness, she filed a divorce petition against Rong in the First Special Court. The divorce was granted, and the two parties were divorced. Later, Rong learned that Li had another affair and reported it to the police. After investigating, the police found no evidence, and Rong no longer had the right as a husband. The case was dismissed. Recently, Li hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Rong in the Civil Division of the Second Court, seeking the 50,000 yuan in alimony.</p>
<p>The Court Received the Complaint</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, judge Yu Changzi presided over the hearing in the Civil</p>
<p>Seventh Division. Both parties arrived in court on time. First, the plaintiff presented the above-mentioned events. The defendant, Rong Wenhao, admitted that the information was true but claimed that he was currently unable to pay such a large sum of money. After a detailed interrogation by Judge Yu, the case was complex, and he announced that the hearing would be adjourned.</p>

<h3>Korean Man Suffers Gunshot Wounds, Seeks Treatment at Hospital, Claims to Have Been Sniped at in Caojiadu</h3>
<p>At 1:15 PM yesterday, a man in a Western suit with three gunshot wounds suddenly arrived at the Sanmin Hospital at 70 North Henan Road, Tiantong Road, in the Public Settlement and requested treatment.

<h3>Gospel for Opium Addicts</h3>
<p>Everyone knows the harm of opium. Mr. Yang Shaoqing previously quit his opium addiction at the Chinese Anti-Smoking Sanatorium at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue Massenet. Because there was no pain during quitting, and his body was strong and his mind was happy after quitting, he was extremely grateful. He voluntarily donated the money he saved after quitting smoking to the hospital to provide free smoking cessation treatment. Dean Jin Xuegao has agreed.

<h3>This City's Review of Middle School Student Records: Preliminary Results to be Announced Soon; Schools' Submission of Rosters Can be Completed by the End of the Month; All Review Standards Are Generally the Same as Before</h3>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) This city's public and private middle schools' student records have been reviewed since this semester. According to the regulations of the Ministry of Education on the reorganization of middle school student records in Shanghai during the war, starting from the first semester of the 29th year, each school should keep the admission documents of new students and transfer students until the end of the semester and then return them. They should also submit the rosters of continuing students, new students, and transfer students within the specified period to allow personnel to be dispatched to each school to review them one by one based on the rosters. If a school fails to comply or if discrepancies are found in the student records, their student records will not be recognized, and the graduation certificates they issue will not be reprinted when local education administrative agencies are restored. The schools that submit the rosters will also be publicly announced at any time. It is learned that the review work for this semester began on October 1st and is currently in progress. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Submission of Rosters Deadline at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Each school's submission of rosters of continuing students, new students, and transfer students for this semester is due by the end of this month. These rosters can be purchased from the Zhengzhong Bookstore on Fuzhou Road. Approximately seventy to eighty percent of the public and private middle schools in the city have already submitted them. It is expected that all of them will be submitted by the end of this month. Personnel are currently being dispatched to the schools that have submitted rosters to conduct a general review. Based on the review results, instructions will be issued separately in accordance with laws and regulations. The work is being carried out with great urgency.</p>
<p>Preliminary Results to be Announced Soon</p>
<p>The public announcement of the review results will begin with the public announcement in the newspapers of the names of the schools that have submitted student rosters, so that the students of each school know that their student records have been reported by the school and are subject to review. It is learned that the schools subject to review are limited to public and private schools that have been registered or approved to open. Schools that have not been registered or approved to open are not subject to review because their student records are fundamentally invalid. Therefore, after the list of these schools is announced, students can find out whether the school they are attending has obtained legal status. This indirectly serves to crack down on illegal private schools.</p>
<p>Review Standards Generally the Same as Before</p>
<p>Regarding the review standards, they generally follow the provisions of laws and regulations. Although the review</p>
<p>Methods are slightly different from before the war due to factual limitations, there is little change in principle. The main points are as follows: (1) The number of places for students with equivalent academic qualifications remains 30% for junior high school and 20% for senior high school. This number of places for students with equivalent academic qualifications is still limited to first-year freshmen. There are no such places for transfer students in any grade. (2) Certificates issued by unregistered private schools are deemed invalid. The students admitted are included in the calculation of the number of places for students with equivalent academic qualifications. (3) When the number of students with equivalent academic qualifications exceeds the quota, the school will conduct screening tests, submit the results, and wait for review. The best students will be selected and admitted within the prescribed quota, and the remaining students will not be recognized. (4) Students from the occupied areas can be handled according to the pre-war principle of reviewing the student records of students from the Northeast Four Provinces, or they can be counted as having equivalent academic qualifications. All unofficial certificates will be revoked and destroyed.</p>
<h3>Donations of Cold Weather Clothing and Cash from the Education Sector Far Exceed Last Year's Results</h3>
<p>Make the Greatest Effort in These Final Three Days</p>
<p>(Dahua News Agency) The various schools in this city are sparing no effort in promoting this year's campaign to solicit donations for cold weather clothing and cash. The targets of the solicitation are not only limited to the staff and students of the school, but also extended to the families and friends of the students. The results are very different and far exceed last year's. It is estimated that by the end of this month, the total amount solicited will be close to 100,000 yuan. Part of this cash is directly remitted to the Chongqing Solicitation Headquarters by the schools, and most of it is submitted to the newspapers that collect the donations. However, their names are either the names of individual staff and students without the school name or alternative names without mentioning the school. However, the amount of their solicitations is reported separately to the education sector and the Shanghai branch for verification and statistics. All sectors admire the enthusiasm of the education sector. It is learned that the various schools will end this solicitation campaign by the end of this month and will make the greatest effort in these final three days. It is also learned that the results of the compulsory education sector are also very impressive after the Compulsory Education Promotion Association formulated methods to promote it on a large scale. Most of the donations have been submitted. It is heard that the Compulsory Education Promotion Association has instructed the districts that have not yet paid to submit the donations directly to the newspapers that collect the donations by the end of this month in order to end the campaign as soon as possible.</p>

Moreover, the United States' participation in the war is inevitable. Chinese merchants sold a huge amount of more than 1 million, and the foreign firms' intake was very weak. Only HSBC slightly maintained it, but the disparity between the crowds was too great, and the trend was fierce. As a result, the evening closing was 3 ounces 96875 for British gold and 6.15625 yuan for the US dollar, which was longer than the weekend closing by 125 and 1875 for British and American, respectively.</p>

No. 1 New Saigon was as high as 67.4 yuan to 66.5 yuan, No. 2 was 72.2 yuan to 71 yuan, Special Self-Roasted was 66 yuan to 64.5 yuan, No. 2 Logao was 61 yuan to 59 yuan, Small Roasted was 60.05 yuan to 59 yuan, Rice was 55.2 yuan to 55 yuan, Broken Tip was 51.2 yuan to 50.07 yuan, Tokyo Tip was 56.5 yuan, Wuhu Tip was 58.8 yuan to 57 yuan, and in the afternoon, because the foreign exchange was long, which was not conducive to hoarding, the market was weak and fell sharply by 1 yuan. No. 2 Red Pagoda brand was 62.2 yuan in the early market, and only 61.12 yuan in the afternoon. Original packaged goods were 74.5 yuan in the early market, and there was still a lack of smooth sales in the afternoon. Rossi's No. 2 Saigon was only 73 yuan, and the goods en route were 72.5 yuan. The evening closing was still soft, with a total of 350 tons of original packaged and current route goods opened throughout the day and 6,000 bags of spot goods.</p>
<p>More than 2,000 bags of new Japonica tip and kiln-seed wild rice first-class rice arrived in total, mostly kiln-seed, and the route was narrow, resulting in a looser selling price, depreciating by more than 0.5 yuan, opening at 75 yuan to 74.2 yuan. The arrival and sale of new Japonica and wild rice were similar, without much fluctuation. New Japonica opened as high as 73 yuan to 71 yuan, the original package was 74.5 yuan, wild rice was 79 yuan, to 77 yuan. Du Yangjian still lacked fluctuations, and the original package was sold for 70 yuan. Broken Japonica was 70 yuan yesterday, to 74 yuan, and the original package was 80 yuan. Glutinous rice, domestic and foreign goods, were also flat.</p>
<h3>Fixed Price Loosening, Current Powder Softening</h3>
<p>The noodles and rice market was still flat and tired yesterday. The market price for No. 1 flour mill was still 17 yuan, and the customer price was 18.5 yuan, which were similar to last week. However, the quantity released by the mills has exceeded 10,000 bags, which is sufficient for the needs of this street. Therefore, the returning goods and old cart warehouse orders lack a fixed recipient. The current foreign powder is gradually softening, because a large amount of fixed powder has been loaded and transported en route, and if there are no obstacles, it will arrive at the port soon. Moreover, the fixed price of Australian powder is loosening, selling for only 15.3 yuan, although it has not been fixed, but people's hearts are depressed. The unified market selling price of Double Eagle brand is 19.1 yuan to 19 yuan, and the Triangle brand foreign powder is only sold for 18.5 yuan, and 300 to 400 bags were handled by this street.</p>
<p>The wheat market yesterday was still in a stalemate, because the supply and demand on the day were lacking, and there was absolutely no formal opening. It was heard that the Japanese mills were still quoting 21 yuan. Except for occasional scattered arrivals that were directly delivered to the mills, the amount transported to the concessions was increasingly lacking. Therefore, the market was as quiet as usual.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn, Turn Buying into Selling, Yarn Price Drops Suddenly</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which has been firm and expensive for two months, is now gradually showing instability and a downward trend. This is because the quantity of thick and thin yarn handled by the Hong Kong brokers in the past was quite considerable. The brokers are temporarily full, or they need to wait for it to melt before purchasing again. At the same time, the bulls' pull is too strong. When encountering an unfavorable environment, the virtual wind is even worse. In addition, with the foreign exchange rising, and gold falling, those who generally regard cotton yarn as a standard have already changed their minds and tend to turn short. However, a large number of people are optimistic, but the sellers are frequently adding codes in the distant months, and the double-horse factory orders have fallen by more than 30 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the current yarn has already seen a dispersed momentum. In general, the bulls who have made profits are selling out. The first disk price of 20-count double-horse yarn is 1,265 yuan, slightly rising to 1,267 yuan. However, sellers and bulls who are closing positions are coming one after another. The general speculators see the wind and steer the rudder. For a time, the chips on the face are oversupplied, and the brokers' shouts are gradually going down, falling to 1,248 yuan. Some short positions cover and rebound to 1,255 yuan. This price has been circulating for a long time. Finally, with the sluggish sales, and the US dollar rising to 6 yuan, the exchange market has returned to a downward trend, and floating long positions are panic-stricken and reluctant to close. The market price has collapsed, falling straight to 1,230 yuan. It has been found that the transaction volume for half a day totaled 5,640 bags, and the price of 20-count double-horse yarn fell by 35 yuan. The amount of each seller's purchase is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Hong Kong 360, Peer 5,180, Total 5,640</p>
<p>Today, 3,190 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Hong Kong, but yesterday, 139 pieces of cotton yarn were also transported from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Quiet</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is slightly weaker. This is because the yarn market has fallen, and the foreign exchange is frequently rising, resulting in a mediocre mentality. However, the industry's thinking is still relatively expensive, but the factory's needs are not strong, but mutual buying and selling are still not lacking. The market is already depressed. Today, 465 bales of cotton were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market is quiet. Due to the lack of important buyers, and then due to the sale of Wall Street, the closing price fell by 3 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian market is calm. Yesterday, including forecasts, there was not much fluctuation. The foreign cotton trading in Shanghai yesterday also turned slightly quieter. All parties are again turning to a wait-and-see attitude due to the sharp loosening of the exchange rate. Therefore, the market trading yesterday was also slightly quieter.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, Yarn Price Falls, Cloth Price Plummets</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: The market trend was soft yesterday, which was affected by the sharp drop in cotton yarn and Dongpi. The mentality of trading turned cold, but the sales of customers still had purchases, so the selling side frequently supported it. White goods, fine cloth, and twill were flat at noon, and the price of each piece of Erhua factory goods fell by 0.25 yuan per piece in the afternoon. Colored cloth and bleached cloth fell by 0.5 yuan. More than 200 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, and bleached cloth were handled by Zhejiang and Fujian brokers. More than 200 pieces of semi-finished blanks, bleached, and dyed cloths were completed in this street.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The morning market was still flat, and the after-market plummeted, which was due to the violent drop in raw yarn, panic among retail investors, and speculative merchants took the opportunity to sell, resulting in a sharp drop of 1.5 yuan per piece for fine cloth and fine twill. The closing price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 36.7 yuan, and the price of Four Gentlemen's Serge was 1.135 yuan, but there were absolutely no orders from foreign firms. The sales were still good, so the industry insiders remained calm.</p>
<p>Export Piece Goods: 3,250 pieces were transported to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Securities, Foreign Exchange Loosening, Foreign Stocks Lost Progress - Domestic Debt Seen Weak Again -</h3>
<p>The black market for securities, the trend yesterday was again slowly falling. Initially, Wuhua Datong and general retail investors bought in, and C-type saw 60 yuan again. Then, Hongda sold and returned slightly. Songmao Yitai bought not much. After the market price hovered slightly, it turned soft again. The noon closing fell by 0.3-0.4 yuan. After the initial opening in the afternoon, the multi-party pulled up again. Changren Renchang was buying in again, and general retail investors followed suit, and the price was raised by 0.3-0.4 yuan again. After entering, Jiufeng Lianhe Hongda had another sale and returned to 0.2-0.3 yuan again. The market price changed several times a day. As a result, except for E-type which was slightly better by 0.1 yuan, the rest returned by 0.2-0.3 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: Cotton Yarn Exchange shares traded 100 shares at a price of 42 yuan each.</p>
<p>The opening of the public stock market was sluggish. Subsequently, the market situation began to turn around due to the surge in the number of transactions in Jardine Matheson and Ho Beer stocks. The former's rise was due to rumors that it would announce dividends. Although the latter's sellers surged, the firm momentum was always maintained. The opening price in the early morning was 8 yuan. For a time, sellers flocked to it, immediately lowering the price to 7.6 yuan. At this price, someone tried hard to support it. The closing price was 7.75 yuan, with 177,000 shares traded. Due to the booming of the above two stocks, the remaining industrial stocks and rubber stocks were almost all ignored. The severe loosening of the exchange rate affected the progress of the stock market is not minor.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Foreign Sugar Transactions Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was still flat and tired, and transactions were unusually quiet. The market price announced by the association, No. 14 raw white had no transactions, transshipment cargo was still 58 yuan, and Dutch red was seen soft at 55 yuan. Taikoo car white B Mark was 72 yuan, small by 0.5 yuan, Dongzhan was 71.1 yuan, HX Mark four stacks was 67.5 yuan, small by 0.3 yuan, Dongzhan was 66.5 yuan, HN Mark was 64 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Incessant Oil Supply, Flat and Weak Oil Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market experienced some fluctuations, but ultimately showed no significant gains or losses. However, futures prices were slightly lower than the market at the end of last week, dropping by about one yuan. Given the oversupply situation, the outlook remains weak. A total of 150 lots of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at 75 yuan. Twenty barrels of Qingdao soybean oil were traded at 99 yuan. One hundred dan of local factory soybean oil were traded at 85 yuan. Fifty lots of Yantai peanut oil for smoking were traded at 69.5 yuan. Additionally, 1,000 cans of tinned oil were traded at 97 yuan. Two hundred and fifty lots of Jiaozhou oil were traded at 70 yuan to 70.05 yuan, then returned to 70 yuan.

<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Guangdong Longans Start Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, two hundred and several dozen boxes of new dried longans continued to arrive on the Qingyuan轮 [Qingyuan steamer]. The first batch of Guangdong goods, one hundred and several dozen boxes, has already been released for sale at a price of 293 yuan. The latest arrivals are from Tong'an and Zhangzhou, potentially easing market prices.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Gardenia Seeds Rise by Six or Seven Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the recent lack of arrivals of small gardenia seeds, market inventory is gradually depleting. Although sales are sporadic, they are considered active, leading to a market upturn. Prices have increased by six or seven yuan compared to the previous period, with high-quality goods priced around 90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal: Borneo Coal Reduced in Price</h3>
<p>Borneo bituminous coal had previously run out of stock, causing a temporary shortage in the market. Recently, it has been reported that a new batch of goods has arrived at the port. Coupled with the recent continuous appreciation of foreign exchange rates, the cost has decreased, and the quoted price is also more favorable. The quoted price for Borneo lump coal is 186 yuan per ton, and for mixed coal, 182 yuan per ton, with additional charges for warehouse, truck transport, and handling.</p>

<h3>Teacher Zhang</h3>
<p>— He Tianxing</p>
<p>The bell rang,</p>
<p>The children poured out like a tide,</p>
<p>The stairs sounded like a rainstorm,</p>
<p>The alleyways were filled with noise and laughter.</p>
<p>Some said,</p>
<p>"Goodbye, Teacher Zhang!"</p>
<p>Some said,</p>
<p>"Teacher Zhang, Xu Wenjin is stealing my things."</p>
<p>Some said,</p>
<p>"Teacher Zhang! Wang Guobao kicked my butt."</p>
<p>Teacher Zhang is their teacher,</p>
<p>Fifty years old this year,</p>
<p>In the school, apart from the "Principal,"</p>
<p>Teacher Zhang is the most hardworking.</p>
<p>Six hours of lessons every day,</p>
<p>From history to geography,</p>
<p>From Chinese to science.</p>
<p>Every time school ends,</p>
<p>Teacher Zhang is so tired he can't walk.</p>
<p>His pale hair</p>
<p>Is covered with a lot of chalk dust,</p>
<p>Making him look even more withered and old.</p>
<p>This year he also caught a cough—</p>
<p>Sometimes he couldn't breathe during class,</p>
<p>The children occasionally laughed when they saw it;</p>
<p>But when Teacher Zhang coughed out tears,</p>
<p>In the solemn atmosphere,</p>
<p>The children would also shed tears.</p>
<p>Teacher Zhang slowly came down the stairs,</p>
<p>Carrying a stack of compositions and exercise books.</p>
<p>The autumn wind blew on his thin shoulders;</p>
<p>Amidst the constant coughing,</p>
<p>He thought again:</p>
<p>Will I eat plain noodles tonight?</p>
<p>Or a bowl of thin porridge?</p>
<h3>I Want to Remain Silent</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen Yanfan</p>
<p>Family</p>
<h3>I Am a Young Widow</h3>
<p>— Yin Yang</p>
<p>Family corruption and emotional discord are the most painful things in life. I am a young widow suffering from pain, living a miserable life in a bad environment, which hurts my pure heart.</p>
<p>My father-in-law is the manager of a certain firm in Shanghai. He is very shrewd and casual. As the saying goes, "Not generous in big matters, but meticulous in small matters." His first wife bore him three daughters and divorced him unconditionally more than twenty years ago (it is said that she is still alive). His second wife gave birth to my husband and a younger sister before passing away. The current wife is said to be a senior hostess from a Tangzi 　[a kind of brothel], and has already given birth to two sons, both currently studying in primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Less than half a year after our marriage, the true colors of this "Third Wife" were revealed without any pretense. She was always looking for trouble and, through clever instigation, we often heard my father-in-law's harsh orders and suffered inhumane punishments, ultimately forcing father and son to live separately. Alas! It was extremely painful. Our loyal people were all her playthings.</p>
<p>Time flowed mercilessly, and more than two years passed quickly. Unfortunately, my husband gradually fell seriously ill due to daily depression and excessive labor. When the news reached home, it was only after the "persuasion" of relatives and elders that he was allowed to return home to recuperate. However, his illness worsened day by day, and even the doctor gave up hope. In the end, he painfully abandoned me and our five-month-old son and passed away. My heart was about to break, and my mind was confused. This was the biggest blow of my life, and the inner pain and oppression from evil forces gradually increased. Who could I turn to for comfort? I could only sob while holding my innocent and lovely child. The child grew slowly with each passing day, and it has been three years since my husband's death. The child can call out "Mom" clearly, but what about "Dad"? It's so pitiful. He is a child without a father, always at a disadvantage and always behind others.</p>
<p>All the extravagance is very common in the hands of the "Third Wife," but the scope is limited to her and her two sons. If relatives happen to visit, she will implement austerity and conservation movements. This is her consistent policy. Her arrogance is extreme, and she can often be heard saying: What does it matter what relatives and friends think? As long as I have money, I am not afraid of anything. She probably has forgotten what happened ten years ago, so none of the relatives are willing to see her unfriendly face. If they unfortunately arrive at this terrible home, she will show all kinds of different expressions: indifference, forced smiles, resentment, cowardice, fear… constantly changing.</p>
<p>The "Third Wife's" vicious methods cannot be fully described by my pen, so I can only bury them in my painful heart. My father-in-law's mind cannot be changed, and the family's fate has already been decided. Poor me, I can only patiently take on the responsibility left by my husband—nurturing my innocent child, breaking the corrupt practices of the old feudal system, and striving to rebuild a pure, happy, and fulfilling family.</p>
<p>Women</p>
<h3>Can or Should</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>Before the Shanghai War, I also heard the high call for women's participation in politics. At that time, my younger sister had just graduated from a university and was working in a certain organization with a passionate hope. Her future was so bright! Unexpectedly, after the August 13th Incident, my sister stopped working and fled to the isolated island. Then she married Lu Jun. She originally planned to embark on a new journey together in the future. Who knew that after a year, my sister had completely changed. In a small family, she could not spare a moment from caring for her beloved son all day long. Her spirit and body gradually withered. One day, I asked her when she would go out into society, and she smiled bitterly, shook her head, and only said, "This hope now belongs to you."</p>
<p>With my sister's talent, she has a clear mind, rich knowledge, and a strong body. How could her efficiency in working in society be less than a man's? She should go out into society, but at present, my sister is burdened by her family; although she has lofty ambitions, she cannot be everywhere at once. Moreover, various institutions often restrict the recruitment of married women, as the recent postal recruitment is an example. Therefore, the core of the problem for women going out into society today lies in whether they can, not whether they should.</p>

<h3>The Long Gown</h3>
<p>— Shou Niu</p>
<p>Scholars often wear long gowns, but wearing long gowns is inconvenient for labor, so people who wear long gowns do not labor, naturally forming the "upper class."</p>
<p>As the upper class gradually increased, people of the proletariat also wore long gowns, also bound by the long gowns, unable to labor. However, since there was no great task to do, then they had to tighten their belts and drink cold water, understanding themselves to be</p>
<p>Clothes are slaves of the Chu people, people are not slaves of clothes. They wear clothes for their bodies, not create a model for clothing. In case the environment is not as desired, if you simply take off the gown and make an accomodation, then that is a real man who can bend or stretch.</p>
<p>Huo Sang Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Queen of Dance's Lodging</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Ten: The Shoe Problem</p>
<p>I was so pleasantly surprised that I didn't have time to speak. I hurriedly took out the soft ruler from my pocket and measured it against the sole of the shoe. It was indeed eleven inches and six.</p>
<p>I looked at Huo Sang and asked, "That's right, are these shoes Lu Jiansheng's?"</p>
<p>Huo Sang did not answer. His shining eyes were still fixed on the shoes. He also stroked the sole of the shoe with the fingertips of his left hand. He also whispered in surprise: "Bao Lang, you also touch it, the sole of this shoe is clearly not completely dry!"</p>
<p>I really followed his words and touched the sole of the shoe with my finger, and then nodded.</p>
<p>He said nervously: "Look carefully, what's the situation with the edges of the heel and the sole?... Nothing? You didn't look carefully. At first glance, the heel seems very clean, but in fact there are still some traces of mud, and they haven't been wiped clean. Look, there's still a lot of mud left in the needle stitches on the bottom edge."</p>
<p>I nodded as if understanding, and said: "In that case, someone wore these shoes last night, and then someone wiped the mud clean. Is that right?" Huo Sang said: "Yes, but it wasn't wiped very clean. This is called a hundred secrets, one slip. Also, look, there's mud on the tip of the shoelace. Do you understand where it came from?... What? Don't understand? That's easy to understand. Just because—"</p>
<p>"Bang!—Bang!"</p>
<p>Although the sound was transmitted through the glass window and wasn't too harsh, both Huo Sang and I could tell that it was the sound of a gun, definitely not any other sound. The source of the gunshot seemed to be right outside the door of this house. At this time, suddenly hearing this sound, of course Huo Sang could not think it was unrelated. He immediately put the shoes back in the wall cabinet, closed the wall cabinet door as before, and then beckoned to me and ran out of the room without saying a word. I also followed behind him. In an instant, Huo Sang had run down the stairs and out to the front door.</p>
<p>When I reached the bottom of the stairs, Jin Mei had also opened the door of the reception room and walked out in panic. She asked me, "Sir, what's the matter?"</p>
<p>I couldn't answer, but shook my head and continued to walk outside. When I stepped onto the cement path, I saw Huo Sang had already walked out of the iron gate with floral patterns. I looked to the left and right, and the outside of the gate was very quiet. Only one car was driving from the west, going towards the east. (150)</p>

<h3>Welcoming the Rebirth of Sino-German Domestically Produced Fashion Films</h3>
<p>— Sun Ruojian</p>
<p>Nothing in the world is immutable. Take domestic films on the isolated island, for example. They cannot escape this law. In this particular time and place, due to the special environment, period dramas emerged in response to the times, while the original contemporary dramas almost completely disappeared. Some time ago, period dramas reached their peak. Now, it is said that contemporary dramas are about to sprout and grow again. In fact, it is telling us that "Qin Huai Shi Jia" by Jin Xing and "Tian Ya Ge Nu" by Guohua are already being filmed.</p>
<p>In the past, period dramas gave the audience a mixed impression: for example, "Li Xiang Jun," "Ge Neng Niang," "Mu Lan Cong Jun," "Liang Hong Yu"... because the themes were tragic and solemn, they were indeed more meaningful to the compatriots on the isolated island; others also promoted China's inherent virtues. In today's declining world, these are indeed worthy of our praise and promotion. However, on the other hand, there are indeed quite a few films that focus exclusively on narrow-minded love stories, mostly writing about "private betrothals in the back garden, and the young master in distress becomes the top scholar." Apart from serving as entertainment for women and children after tea and dinner, they have no other important content.</p>
<p>Because of the popularity of period dramas, filmmakers competed day and night to shoot them, creating the phenomenon of "crude production and poor quality" in the past. In terms of production, of course, there were no good results—even some films had light so dark that they were almost black, so that the characters on the screen were completely blurred; the sound recording was also terrible. These were indeed the most obvious bad consequences of the period drama craze.</p>
<p>Now, contemporary dramas have been "reborn" following period dramas. It is hoped that filmmakers will recognize that "movies are a form of public education" and shoulder the heavy responsibility of public education on the isolated island. For the "rebirth" of contemporary dramas, they must use the method of "eliminating the dross and preserving the essence"—allowing the meaningful themes in period dramas to remain in contemporary dramas—to accomplish this important mission. Don't just focus on business and crudely produce again and again, making mistakes over and over. Know that crude production is not only unprofitable but also creates a bad impression among the audience about your company's productions. This will simply lead to your own decline.</p>
<h3>The Public Harmonica Society's Tenth Anniversary Concert</h3>
<p>— Xing Gu</p>
<p>The Public Harmonica Society is celebrating its tenth anniversary this year. On the evening of the 26th, a concert was held at Aurora University to raise funds for the society's instrument fund. The program was quite exciting. At the beginning, to show respect, Shi Renwang conducted the society's harmonica team and accordion team in playing the national anthem. After the performance, the entire audience stood up and sang the national anthem again.</p>
<p>Then, the "Silver Bell" prelude, with its loud and solemn music, gave the entire audience an uplifting emotion. The accordion quartet "Happy Family" waltz was quite pleasant to the ear.</p>
<p>After a five-minute break, the second part of the program began. Zhu Caijun's accordion duet "Cui Ti Chun Xiao" [Spring Dawn on the Emerald Bank], with its graceful and sweet sound, moved people's hearts. Shi Renwang's harmonica solo "The Merry Widow" used four harmonicas to play several different tunes, which was really pleasant to listen to. The song was very long. After the performance, the entire hall resounded with applause.</p>
<p>Next was Miss You Hailun's solo on the harmony instrument, the overture "Poet and Peasant". Miss Shi was graceful and beautiful, and she was able to perform this great masterpiece so wonderfully and seamlessly, without any clumsiness. It was truly rare. After the public joint team played "Mysterious Spain," the society presented two bugles to the Sino-French Boy Scouts in appreciation of their hard work in serving the public, and the band of the Sino-French Boy Scouts played the "Salute" tune on the spot to express their gratitude, which was quite interesting. Then, the Public Harmonica Society's anthem was sung, and the meeting ended.</p>
