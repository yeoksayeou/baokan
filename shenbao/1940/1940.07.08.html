<p>社評</p>
<h3>英法交惡與世運前途</h3>
<p>自納粹德國於此度歐戰中運用其獨創之閃電戰略而一再收穫宏效以來，軍事理論已頓改舊觀，促成全盤革新之機運；而影響所及，使國際方面亦發生種種詭譎突兀之事變，有如迅雷疾雨之不可捉摸；此無他，蓋亦閃電戰略之一種暗示的效果，而此種作風已由純軍事領域擴而及於政治外交諸範疇。即如本月三日英海軍之突事攻襲北非法艦，以及英法關係之轉趨惡化，實爲法國停戰以來最驚心動魄之另外一慕。世變愈演愈烈，一切已非常理常情與一般理智所能揣度。且此後禍亂愈蔓延，爭戰愈尖銳，理論是非之爭必愈趨混沌以至於不可究詰；則此後交戰國雙方殆均將漸捨其是白非素之攻訐與爭持，轉而以全力從事於生死利害之搏鬬，是誠所謂人生到此天道髯論者。世界人類之空前浩刧，於茲同方興未艾也。</p>
<p>此度英艦在北非之行動，殆爲去秋歐戰發生以來協約國採取主動攻勢之第一次，所收戰果較南美海上斯比上將號一役尤遠過之。雖此僅屬戰友寒盟後兇終隙末之一幕，並非敵對國家之正面交綏，但無論法英之間是否終將由絕交而不免相見以兵戎，要未容吾認此度英方在軍事上之重大成就。假如英方於事後所發文吿不含誇大成分，則號稱歐洲第二位之法海軍，已有半數以上歸英掌握或被擊燬。以今日英海軍實力與德義以及可資德義利用之法海軍殘餘總和相較，蓋英國已佔絕對優勢。法德言和後，世人所共同注意之法海軍問題，於茲殆已告段落。而經過南美與此度地中海二役試騐而後，乃益證實不列顚之海上權威迄今殊未可輕侮。</p>
<p>英國海軍勢力縱甚堅强，目前尙未能遽爾斷言其足以保障英倫之安全與戰爭之勝算，由於近年立體戰術之進步，海軍艦艇在海上之威力已頗見减色，德海軍並不發達，今且沉創殆盡，而其空軍則往往能予英無敵海軍以困擾，前此英航空母艦光榮號在那維克海面之沉沒，即其一例，而另一方面，各國軍事家之推崇艦艇功用而輕蔑空軍在海上之作用者，依然不乏其人。英之軍用飛機，據聞其效能確較德義所用者爲優良，而數量則遠有未逮。是則此後英德戰局之中，其主要之爭逐，乃爲英方海軍對德義空軍之決勝，其優劣休戚，與夫海空兩軍在今日戰爭中之地位，尙猶有待於未來事實爲之證明。至於英法關係惡化後在世界各方所引起之新的情勢則尤爲繁複。貝當政府對英宣戰之說茲已甚囂塵上，如其不幸而竟成事實，將益增加今茲戰局之奇詭與錯綜；在軍事方面固未必即發生重大影響，而其所加於世人心理上之刺激則至深且鉅，將益憬然於今日國際間離合友敵之無常。法國以一等强國驟遭敗　之餘，國策復形成絕大角度之轉變，其當局之心情與人民之處境均令人難於設想。而世界各處之法國屬領，自法德言和以來，諸單位有各自爲政之觀，其動向究竟如何，迄今尙未十分明瞭；更經此度事變，其向背與歸趨必將更形微妙。近東方面，英法各駐重兵，北非各地帶則已往有軍事之聯防，而尤以大西太平兩洋以及南亞方面之屬領，雙方領土密接，利害相若，於新舊大陸艱危局勢之中，更有其牽一髮即動全身之重要性，其影響所及已遠超過歐戰本身得失之外，此則世人之所應特予注視者也。</p>
<p>歐戰迄今十閱月，及至今茲，始進入短兵相接之決勝節段；而此十閱月間歐陸地圖之變色，各國國情之更張，其速其劇，已超過歐洲歷史上任何時代之紀錄。此後鬥爭愈慘烈，變化愈迅速，更不知將創造何等奇變異蹟以點綴此一悲劇的時代。所望各交戰國家稍能適可而止，不爲已甚，勿徒斤斤於恩怨與報復之是快，免爲次一代人民重種再度仇殺之惡因，則戰爭之破壞雖云慘重，尙不徒爲毫無代價之犧牲也。</p>

<p>虹口楊樹浦一帶、日軍戒備、亦甚嚴密、武裝巡邏隊以二人爲一組、不斷在各馬路巡行、楊樹浦路滙山碼頭附近日志賀部隊之駐紥地、昨特禁止華人行近該處、而各日商店門前、大部挿有太陽旗、閘北徒手僞警、昨日亦在衝要路口戒備、但一般居民處在特殊環境下、甚少外出、故情形愈顯凄凉、</p>
<p>愚園路口　一度緊張</p>
<p>昨日下午四時三十分、有僞警吾人、肩荷步槍越入海格路愚園路轉角二十八號新元泰水菓行鬥前馬路上、爲駐在愚園路口之英國防軍瞥見、乃勸告僞警等離去、僞警置之不理、態度強橫、竟與英防軍發生衝突、並持槍作射擊狀、一時形勢甚爲緊張、靜安寺路捕房近在咫尺、聞訊後、立派中西探捕蒞塲、維持秩序、並派裝甲車三輛前往戒備、雙方相持約半小時、由靜安寺路捕房高級職員出面解釋、僞警始悻悻離去、</p>
<p>互爭稅卡</p>
<p>本月五日淸晨四時半至五時許、及前日（六日）佛曉時、由滬西傳來密集之機關槍聲及雜亂之步槍聲、間有小鋼砲聲、轟隆劈拍、至爲清晰、法租界居民、於驚疑之時、莫名其所以、兼之租界以外、地屬淪陷、以致眞相無法探明、茲據平明社向龍華來人探悉，實係「和平救國軍」與日軍爭「稅卡」而起火併、係張惠芳與日軍交綏、張部不支退出、聞此次雙方死傷甚重、</p>
<h3>日司令西尾來滬　昨赴國際飯店遊宴　率所屬十餘名分乘汽車多輛　靜安寺路採捕防軍嚴密戒備</h3>
<p>日派遣軍總司令西尾壽造、於前日甫由江寗來滬、昨晨八時、率領所屬高級軍官約十餘名、分乘南京汽車照會一號汽車、上海防軍照會只第「四五二」·「二九二」·「三〇三」·「二六四」·「二〇九」等汽車、及其他機器脚踏車十數輛、赴靜安寺路</p>
<p>國際飯店飲宴、西尾等抵國際飯店後、卽在該飯店之十四層樓上、與僚屬進餐、並參觀該飯店之設備、並出其所携地圖、由西尾之屬員指點解釋、馮窗遠矚、瀏覓景物、事先該管新閘捕房、早已得報、派有大批武裝中西探捕、在國際飯店之內外、密佈戒備、而</p>
<p>美國防軍亦有數十名、在門外佈崗、西尾等逗留約一小時又半、至十時十五分、始相率下樓、各等其所乘汽車、其時靜安寺國際飯店附近一帶臨時禁止車輛行人通過、迨西尾等去後、復由美國軍用卡車第「一七六」號及「二二二」號二輛、滿載武裝美防軍在</p>
<p>日軍官等汽車之最前及最後各一輛、嚴重戒備之下、沿靜安寺路向西而去、護送至美軍防區之億定盤路以西、向梵皇渡方面而去、當西尾等汽車駛出租界而至</p>

<h3>擅入美軍防區　日憲兵被捕　十六人均被繳械　說明誤會後送還</h3>

<p>美兵逮捕</p>
<p>押往美陸戰隊司令部、美駐軍當局乃向日軍當道提出强硬抗議、要求日方書面道歉、蓋便衣日人今日持械人美軍防區、實犯破壞公共租界各國駐軍司令間久已存在的協定之罪也、惟日大使館今日午前</p>
<p>廣播文告</p>
<p>强詞反駁、謂日憲兵僅係採取「例行辦法」、保護今晨赴國際飯店出席宴會之西尾造壽將軍、致「疏忽」而未顧及協定云、今晨、便衣日憲兵泰半在靜安寺路一帶被美兵逮捕、彼等在某數路轉角處</p>
<p>往來徘徊</p>
<p>腰間及臀部突出、引起美兵同路靜安寺路口卡車中之便衣日憲兵四名、亦遭拘捕載入美陸戰隊巡邏車押走、聞被捕日人、並無抵抗者、</p>
<p>昨晚本報探悉、被逮捕之十六名日便衣憲兵於午後五時許、經解釋誤會後、卽送至外白渡橋交與日方、</p>

<h3>濬浦局發表　浦江浚工眞相</h3>
<p>上海濬浦總局、對浦江浚工、大規模開始之說、特予鄭重吾認、七月份高潮、則已經該局測定、飭爲注意、大通社記者茲錄於後、</p>
<p>挖泥船隻</p>
<p>外傳該局挖泥船建設號、已修理竣工、復興號已自德開駛來滬、及浦江浚工、自七月起、大規模開挖之說、特予鄭重吾認、緣就該局所知、建設號尙泊法租界外灘江心修理、並未移動一步、復興號雖早經在德竣工、惟前以國內戰事今因歐戰關係、臺無啟駛來滬之事實及可能性、故上項消息之傳佈、深爲可異、</p>
<p>開浚規模</p>
<p>關於浦江浚工、該局現有陳家嘴及陸家嘴以下兩段開挖、陸家嘴以下一段浚工、業已竣事、惟工程均屬甚少、遠不逮戰前之什一、因該局現得調動之挖泥船、祗海象海豹等、寥寥之數艘、非如戰前全部挖泥船可資調遣也、故外傳七月份起、大規模開工之說、並不確實、</p>
<p>高潮數量</p>
<p>該局水利科、於七月份高潮汛期之數量、已經測定、茲錄於下、七月七日十一呎四寸、八日十一呎二寸五分、九日十一呎〇五分、十日十呎八寸、十一日至十七日發潮平穩、十八日午夜起趨高、計有十呎九寸五分、二十日十一呎六寸三分、二十一日十一呎五寸二分、二十二日十一呎二寸五分、二十三日十呎七寸、</p>
<h3>滬貨外銷　遭遇困難　南銷交通困難　北運又受限制</h3>
<p>本埠各國貨工廠運往粵桂川滇等各地之貨物及布疋、向由杳港轉蔴章轉口、或再由滇越路轉往各地、自滇越路運輸發生困難後、最近香港又因英日形勢緊張·致貨運驟感困難、本市各國貨廠商之輸出貿易、數量漸見减低、蓋蔴章毘連龍山、日軍在彼、近頗活躍、並有侵略該地之舉動、各商廠不願冒此絕大危險也、故近來本埠運往以上各地之貨物、大部改道、惟交通則感頗困難、蓋無公路鐵路之建設、運輸全恃水道、日期勢必延緩、因此各內地之滬貨、供不應求、尤以布疋爲甚、而本埠則存貨沛充、無法外銷、至華北方面、自實行統制進口貿易、俾减少「聯銀券」所受之壓力以後、由第三國及華中華南輸入華北之貨物、除糧食外、均須備具「準備銀行」之「承認書」、或「海關監督」之「許可證」、故木埠今後對華北輸出、除米麵外、均將大受打擊、其最受影響之主要貨品爲捲烟·布疋·綢緞·茶葉、及化妝品、</p>
<h3>煤球昨已　跌價傾銷　成本减輕　銷路不暢</h3>
<p>各廠煤球售價、前經該業公會議訂標準市價、無論廠盤門市、不得逾限交易、一時各廠尙遵守門市一律每担八元、日昨某廠以製造成本似已减輕、爰貶價出棧、一時市面降風驟起、表面廠盤雖仍喊一百四十八元、實際已開價一百四十元、故各門市部售價、亦頗不一律、計七元六角·七元四角·七元二三角·不等、探悉現在市上現貨不無增多、加以各煤球廠因溽暑頃屆、煤球銷路不暢、故已减低生產、總之、目前煤球製造成本顯已减低、故核减售價、似不容刻緩、</p>
<h3>防癆會六月份捐款</h3>
<p>上海防癆協會自六月一日至三十日止、共收各方捐款八千九百七十一元九角二分、此外尙蒙各界捐贈品多種、</p>
<h3>法大使館武官回滬</h3>
<p>駐華法大使館武官怡逢氏、自華南回滬、</p>
<h3>港越交通遭壓迫後　滇緬路重要性　成為華南唯一國際運輸綫　日方對緬甸消息特予重視　香港英當局大量積儲糧秣</h3>
<p>香港越南緬甸爲戰後中國唯一之國際交通綫、所有土貨之輸出、及必需品之輸入、均由三處爲進出之重要地、尤以香港爲最、日本雖曾要求英法企圖封鎖、今除越南貨運被迫暫停外、香港緬甸則仍暢通、惟今後之緬甸、因滇緬公路已完成、且滇緬鐵路通車在卽、所以緬旬將成爲中國南部唯一之國際運輸綫、香港因四週爲日本所封鎖、對華貿易勢必感受影響、</p>
<p>貿易概況</p>
<p>聞中國政府對統制輸出之豬鬃桐油茶葉礦產、將改由滇緬公路、由緬甸轉運歐美、茲錄今年一月至五月、港越緬對華之貿易如下、香港進口三一·三八六千元、出口一七七·五四三千元、越南進口六四·三七八千元、出口二六·七〇〇千元、緬甸進口五·二七〇千元、出口八·二八二千元</p>
<p>港防近狀</p>
<p>上海與海防間貨運向極繁榮、自越南法黨局接受日方要求、滇越鐵路禁運軍用品入華、並派員在越南境內監視、因之邇來海防情况、頗爲各方所關懷、茲據平明社記者昨晤最近自海防道經香港來滬之可靠萊科探詢近狀、據稱予於本月一日自海防來滬、其時海防所有華方</p>
<p>貨物運輸業已陷於全部停頓所有華方設置於越南海防河內等各處運輸機關、亦已撤退、其中積儲貨物、雖多來自美國、但其責任在未運至中國境內時、仍由美方負之、故越南法當局之此種措置、不但違背中法協定、抑且有意漠視第三國權益、且日方所拍之「檢視員」、其組織份子、多為日方海陸軍人員、其爲含有軍事性質、灼然可見、則未來之越南、如何演變、至堪煩盧、此不特使中國西南各省受到威脅、卽英美兩國在</p>
<p>遠東地位現亦因法日兩國間之所爲、遭遇嚴重影響矣、予曾目覩法國人員與日方人員、同乘機器脚踏車招搖過市、疾駛往返、視彼等行動、抑且超過世所明知「協定」之上、殊有監視貨運之外、對於道經越南進出之華人、橫遭曩昔所無之嚴密搜查、凡文件·書籍·以至私人信件、時遭無端沒收、一般華入以越南法當局、對於華人如此漠視、相率離越者、日見衆多、予乘輪至香港時、復遭日</p>
<p>軍艦阻止停駛、被日海軍上輪搜查、至於香港形勢、仍極緊張、疏散婦孺工作、極爲積極、惟華人大多乘輪來滬、因之由港來滬航論、莫不擁擠異常、惟有事可吿慰滬人者、香港英當局對於侵略者確已準備抵抗、而香港實力、亦極充份、雖糧食向須取給於外埠、現聞已有大批積儲、足敷非常時期多時之需要云、</p>
<p>日方重視</p>
<p>字林西報七月六日東京特電云、日本各無綫電台、每日向全國廣播關於南洋羣島及華南之消息、足證日本對該兩地、關注日深，昨夜日方人士稱、邇來英國之戰具接濟品經香港與緬甸運往重慶者、倍於往昔、各報現以顯著地位、刊載緬甸與越南經濟資源及政治地位、曁兩地土人特性之文字、</p>

<h3>市場知識顧問</h3>
<p>黃道章君問：</p>
<p>（一）貴報於五月二十五日商業新聞欄內載中央銀行掛牌白銀稅徴百分之一五·〇〇。依英金一先令二辦士半計算不知何謂白銀平衡稅及徴百分之一五·〇〇是何意義？</p>
<p>（二）同日所載海關金合英金三十九辦士五及合美金五角二分一八七五，則是用何公式折合？</p>
<p>（三）英純金每盎斯八磅八先令是否固定不變？</p>
<p>——請上海經濟諮詢所代答</p>
<p>（一）白銀平衡稅本為中國銀元成分較法幣價值為商時所設，使中國銀元不致流出。平衡稅率依英金一先令二辦士半與前一日倫敦大條銀價計算，如銀元每元所含的銀分，較一先令二辦士半為高，則卽以其超過數量課稅，一五·〇〇卽為此項課稅率。</p>
<p>（二）關於合英金辦法，乃依每元等於一先令二辦士半算出。中央銀行掛牌關金每元等於法幣二·七〇七元，而法幣每元對英匯率為十四辦士半，故（2.707×145＝89.25）關金每單位為三十九辦士二五。至於對美元價值，則依前一日紐約對英收盤匯率計算，卽為五角二分一八七五。</p>
<p>（三）英鎊官定匯價為對美四元〇二分，而美國又官定匯價為對美四元〇二分，而美國又官定黃金價為每盎斯三十五元，且竭力收購國內國外的黃金而維持此項價格，故倫敦英純金每盎斯八鎊八先令的價格並無變動。</p>
<p>孫獻南君問：</p>
<p>閱金融週刊九卷十八期平衡稅表四月二十三日之記載：</p>
<p>英匯平價十七·三五二二，上海開盤英匯價四·一二五，差價一三·二二七二，理論之平衡稅三一二·九一，平衡稅（百分數）一二·〇〇差額三〇〇·九一</p>
<p>（一）理論之平等稅三一二··九一　平衡稅十二·〇〇　差額三〇〇·九一　以上三種數目根據何種計算而待？</p>
<p>（二）我國徴平衡稅之原理？</p>
<p>（三）該期平衡稅星期一何以祇有上海開盤英匯價四·一二五〇及平衡稅九·七五　而無其他之記載？</p>
<p>請上海經濟諮詢所代答</p>
<p>（一）理論平衡稅乃根據黑市匯價計算，因匯價的下落，平衡稅當為三一二·九一%　但如以每元等於一先令二辦士計算，則僅課稅一五·〇〇%卽是，二者差額計為三〇〇·九一，如以每元等於一先令二辦士半計算平衡稅，則其今式如下：</p>
<p>倫敦銀價×0.8165744（每元所含銀純量）</p>
<p>（一）14.5（一先令二辦士）+</p>
<p>（倫敦銀價×0.8165744）</p>
<p>（二）關於平衡稅原理，請參照答黃道章君所問，</p>
<p>（三）倫敦大條銀價每星期六停市，故星期一日無英匯平價。</p>

<p>沈承照君問：</p>
<p>（一）何謂進口押匯？A／P辦法如何？</p>
<p>（二）遠期外匯如何產生？</p>
<p>請上海經濟咨詢所代答</p>
<p>（一）進口押匯為銀行融通進口商並代為處理對外支付之業務通常有二種方式：</p>
<p>一，銀行應進口商之請求代為承兌外國出口商所發之匯票，其辦法先由進口商向其往來銀行請求發一商業信用證書，（簡稱匯信），（Oommercial　letter　of　credit）寄與出口商後者乃根據此滙信對發信銀行發票，蓋匯信之抬頭人即為出口商，言明在規定金額以內，受信人得向發信銀行開發匯票，而由後者承兌或付款，出口商將匯票連同各種貨物單據如輪船提貨單保險單發票等向其往來銀行貼現（是為出口押滙方式之一），然後由出口商之銀行將此項匯票及單據寄與進口商之銀行承兌，後者於承兌以後，一面將滙票退還，一面將貨物單據留下，通知進口商備款領取提貨單據，或由進口商對其銀行出一信託收條卽可取得跟單，但於滙票到期以前，必須將票款付清，至於此一滙票經銀行承兌以後，卽在票據市場轉輾貼現，及票期已屆，執票人卽可持向承兌銀行兌現，而後者因已收到進口商之票款，卽可以之贖回，在此種交易中，出口商於貨物裝運出口之日，旣已獲得現款，而進口商得於貨物到地以後付款或取得貨物後，尚可向銀行請求在票期內延期付款，（如用信託取條），期間負墊款之責者非為出口商之銀行，亦非為進口商之銀行，蓋前者於滙票及其跟單送達國外代理銀行時經承兌後卽可在市場貼現，變成在其代理銀行之存款，後者僅負承兌之責，實際上並未墊款，眞眞墊款者乃為購入此滙票之投資人，我國因無票據貼現市場，各銀行之信用又無國際地們可言，故我國銀行向不發行匯信。</p>
<p>二，銀行應進口商之請求代為委託其國外代理銀行購入出口商所發之滙票，我國之進口押滙大都係用此一方式，此辦法先由進口商向其往來銀行請求發一委託購買證（Nuthouuity　to　pwchase簡書A／P），內容亦為書函式，係發信銀行致其代理銀行者，後者接信後卽通知出口商，開具匯票（此匯票之承兌與付款人為進口商）連同跟單賣與該行，該行卽出委託銀行之往來賬戶下付出現款，而將匯票及跟單寄與委託銀行，後者接到滙票及跟單後卽通知進口商備款取作，此項滙票不能轉輾貼現，因其非為銀行承兌匯票也。</p>
<p>（二）遠期外匯亦稱外匯期貨，（Forward　exchange）十九世紀之維也納與柏林卽有外幣期貨之買賣，其後幣不穩定國家之外匯市場多有訂結遠期者，我國在銀本位時，因匯價漲落不定，外匯期貨市場亦早已產生，此因進出口貿易在貨幣不穩定時，匯兌上之風險頗大，進口商為確定其購貨成本計，需要預購外滙，出口商為確定其收入計，需要預售外匯，前者為求而後者供適可互相交換，其間更有外匯投機家之買空賣空乃構成今日之外匯期貨市場。</p>
<p>馬國良君問：</p>
<p>何謂滙兌傾銷Exdhange　dumping</p>
<p>請上海經濟咨詢所代答</p>
<p>以貨幣貶值或其他方法抑低對外滙價，則本國出口貨價，以外幣計算，必形低落，因而在國外市場可以賤賣，自一九三一年英國放棄金本位後，鎊價暴落，各金本位國家步其後塵，互以貶低幣値，競爭國外市場，當時有貨幣戰爭之稱，匯集兌傾銷之名亦卽由是而起。</p>
<p>尤堅君問：</p>
<p>（一）自廢規元之後，計算倫敦電滙平價時欲求上海對英定數用華德（H．O．White）之聯鎖計算法仍適用否？應如何計算請示一例。</p>
<p>（二）根據申報市價一覽滙豐掛牌英滙及海外各國　匯集欄英對美匯而計算所得之美匯與報載美匯數目相差有一美元，其原因為何？抑計算有誤？可否舉一實例？</p>
<p>（三）海外各國互匯欄內英對美及美對英兩項匯價何以不同？</p>
<p>（四）十一日申報商業新聞欄內金融新聞外滙項有「終先令三便士四三七五美金四元六二五」一句而該日市價表由美滙為四元三一二五，又英滙僅三便士，頗有相差請問市價表行市根據何方所得？</p>
<p>請上海經濟咨詢所代答</p>
<p>（一）自廢兩改元以後至法幣政策施行以前，對外漲價，以銀本位幣表示倫敦電匯集平價，仍用聯銷法計算，其算法如次：</p>
<p>？便士＝銀本位幣一元</p>
<p>銀幣一元＝23.4934483公分純銀</p>
<p>31.10351公分＝1盎斯</p>
<p>.925盎斯純銀＝倫敦每盎斯標準銀市價（卽報載大條行市）</p>
<p>.8165744×倫敦每盎斯標準銀市價＝英匯集平價</p>
<p>如大條行市為21便士則英滙平價當為：</p>
<p>.8165744×21＝71.1479624便士（卽銀幣一元合便士數）</p>
<p>（二）海外各國互匯集英對美四元〇二分半係英國統外匯後之官定匯價，欲做套滙者並不能按此率以先令購換美金，先令之實際價値須根據紐約之滙市，亦卽海外各國互滙欄內之美對英，欲做套滙者祇能按照美對英之套價，以先令購換美金，故滙豐掛牌英滙與美滙當係根據美對英套價調整，茲隨舉四月二十日申報商業新聞所載滙豐掛牌與海外各國互滙為例，是日報載豐掛牌英滙四便士，美滙五元七五，海外各國互匯英對美四元〇二分半，美對英三元五角一分半，據英對美計算，則上海美滙應為：六·六〇七八三三元，其算法如次：（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　一週來匯市之檢討</h3>
<p>據上海經濟咨詢所報吿、上週匯市承前週之走勢、仍不脫離盤旋狀態、除週一週二銀行結算休假外、實際交易衹有四日、美匯最高六元三四三七五、最低六元〇六二五、英匯最高四便士〇三一二五、最低三便士八一二五、考起伏因素、據市場所傳、約有下列數端、（一）宋子文氏在美之折衡、（二）香港局勢緊張、（三）華北黃金來滬套賣、按宋氏抵美已近兩週、雖有接觸頻繁之報道、而內容如何、迄猶未明、億自事變以來、美國曾兩度對華公開借款、一為廿七年十二月貸二千五百萬元、二為本年三月貸二千萬元、今以宋氏之聲譽、躬自赴美、如欲借款、當非難事、至借款將以何種方式為之、目前尚難臆斷、徴諸宋氏近日與進出口銀行之一再接洽、當可窺見一斑、顧宋氏向主健全財政之策、平時又抱負不凡、此行目標、或於經濟以外、更有其他重要使命存焉、再此次借款、是否引起別方之刺激、以致政府加強管理滙市、亦未可知、歐事複雜、港局尤見緊張、交通路綫、漸生問題、外滙需要當減少、惟港局惡化、上海情形能否穩定、市場影響如何、尚須證諸事實、况英日問題緊張、美日關係亦難樂觀、所謂逃資者、直有何處樂土之感、以是市面徘徊、成交數量益見微小、本週因黃金傾瀉、外滙隨之波動、而黃金所以劇瀉者、厥為華北與滬市金價之差甚巨、查近日華北金價約為四千六百元、滬市則仍在五千高價以上、再加津滬升水、故套做獲利甚厚、况關外法定金價、衹為二千二百元、如有任意高抬、自由買賣者、非但充公、甚至罹刑、華北有金者、深恐津埠援引其例、尤欲脫手為快、於是滬市金價乃愈形跌落、滙票與金價本有聯帶關係、金價旣跌、自不免影響滙市、况過去華北商人、囤積商貨過多、近頃價暴落、遭此嚴重打擊、損失頗巨、不得不拋出黃金、以資彌補、致造成今日滙市之現象、此外市場中常有日金票大量供給、價格趨落、對方為維持起見、乃拋出外滙、亦為滙市放長之另一原因、至週六外滙走勢、雖因美滙兌報小、晨開微堅、終因脚地甚硬、陸續放長、卒以本週最鬆價收盤、</p>
<h3>金融述評　七月六日止　（續）</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>向美國再商借一批巨大的信用借款、以購買五金·汽油·汽車·機器以及其他建設上所需原料、以期完成自給自足的抗建經濟政策、當是切要的企圖、這是宋氏所要進行的第二金融使命、—按第二次信用借款成立之後、中國曾設法向美國再借五千五百萬元、（見本年三月九日合眾社電、）</p>
<p>然而這所關涉的決不止是金融問題而已、</p>
<p>（三）外匯黃金與股票</p>
<p>因為有兩天的銀行半年決算休假、所以金融市場上的活動僅有四天、按這四天的統計看來外匯黃金的行市、無論開收盤最高低、可稱完全是上升的趨勢、英匯的波動是〇·二〇三一二五便士、美匯的波動是〇·三一二五分、黃金的漲落範圍是四百六十五元、外股仍是平疲、</p>
<p>支配滙市趨鬆的原因、除五日因烚赤跌風過甚而帶硬外、環境於市場上的遠東緊張局勢、使能經營者歛手、而宋氏在美的活動、使得多頭覺得敗無所益、成則有報、所以在利益情形下、行市趨長、同時基本影響滙市的因素、還是歸附於紐約的美英匯率、查按六月六日以來的統計、自美英匯率上升之後、本市英匯趨強的程度不過百分之三、而美匯改善的程度則達百分之十左右、所以美英匯率不波動之情形下、上海滙市可能地在常態下發展而去、</p>
<p>在上海的幾個實業界和金融界人士新近組成一個「中國股票有限公司」於七月三日開始營業、專門代客買賣華商股票、代理各公司招募股份代發行公司債以及與股票有關的一切業務、據聞該公司的資金是五萬元、營業的方式是如下所述、（未完）</p>

<p>武鄉試（二）</p>
<p>武舉之科，乃有明新例，而本朝沿之，元以前本無有也。有明之有武科，實有所以重之者，各鎮將弁，大都正途出身，與行伍並駕齊驅；且行伍以出伍之功，始有遷擢，而武科則循資格，較之行伍，猶有勝也。本朝以滿營規制，參用於綠營，因而武職班中，必尚營派，而正途人員，反覺畸輕，故制度雖沿自前明，而意旨已大異乎前明也。竊謂卽如前明，其所習者如其所用，其所用者如其所重，當其末造，雖敗壞於文臣，而喪師失地之罪，亦未始不在武臣，則前朝之制度，亦何所惜而不廢之乎。或謂近年崇尚西洋火器，似宜於弓馬刀石之外，兼試洋槍，得免正途武員，轉不及行伍之嫻習，而委補差使更瞠乎其後之弊。並海疆舟師中水手，亦凖其一體與試，而較其所長，庶習槍砲水師者，亦得以科甲出身，而學中之武生，兼熟槍砲之技，則合水師陸營與武生，併其進取之路，使不至有輕重之弊。此議較上年兩江沈制軍主張之廢武舉為佳矣。</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>衣食住行四事口吟</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>戰事發生以來，各地人民，稍有經濟能力者，僉避居滬上，因是房價日增，甚覺爲難，近年來因種種關係，百物昂貴，人生四大要素中，無一不受影響。錢君士靑有心人也，脫離政治生涯後，僑居滬上，詩酒自遣，一昨來會，出示其最近所作之衣食住行四事吟七古一章，用典古雅，語甚透澈，不特將孤島近狀，描寫殆盡，且含有勸人節儉之意，錄實本刋，以供同好。</p>
<p>一自烽火漫中原，孤島避亂若桃源，人口驟增土地狹，衣衣住行事事艱。絲綢本爲江浙產，棉布工藝亦發展，於今廠號多停頓、因之出貨男周轉。昔時綢價五六角，今則漲至兩元餘，布疋一尺二三角，今則三倍質料　。自古民以食爲天，盛世斗米值百錢，今則百金糴兩石，苦力勤苦須終年。囤戶貯積競居奇，千倉萬箱任把持，孤島由是價飛漲，窮氓　粥莫能支。咬得菜根稱儉德，近時　　尙難得，菜價奇昂囊羞澀，我欲采薇首山側。肉味不知子聞　，鼎烹安有口福消，過鬥大嚼徒流　，思嘗一　苦値高。鑽　取火古法湮，煤球燃料廣發明，來源缺乏價上提，茹毛飲血學先民。一　容膝本易安，孤島地小難回旋，　　莫賃梁鴻窘，瞻烏爰止詠詩篇。王尼無屋宿露車，袁閎土室願亦虛，何來一片乾淨土，巢居六處方寬舒。大夫之後不　行，車價騰貴阻行程，安步當車斯爲上，休擁大蓋自誇矜。我今爲勸殖產者萬勿壟斷圖獲利，放利而行必多怨，何如慷慨明大義。我今又勸僑寓者，食宿衣履崇儉約，安貧樂道靜待時，總得還鄉完家家室須知孤島非樂土，幕燕釜魚難久處，遷居內地易謀生，於己於人兩有補。</p>
<h3>汗衫貴後</h3>
<p>— 兆</p>
<p>天熱了，穿汗衫的時候又到了，但是今歲汗衫的價目，一打聽可眞嚇人，最起碼的也須二元左右哩！入眼些的就要三元四元。在這個時期，米要買六七十元一石，兼之日常用品無不昂貴數倍，生活担子的重壓，是使每一個人都喘不過氣來，因此在支出項下莫不力求節省，那末像今年汗衫奇貴後，我們應以什麼來代充汗衫呢？有，現在讓我來介紹吧！</p>
<p>我們可以到布店裏去購買白色的麻紗（各色俱有）來裁製無領短袖像汗衫樣的小短衫穿着，麻紗可說是夏令最廉美的衣料了，每尺約三角左右，一件二尺畏的小短衫，六尺是儘够了，自己縫縫，或叫上裁縫踏上一踏，那夜化不了幾個錢。總之，一件麻紗衫所費的錢，着實要比一件汗衫的價錢克己得多，而舒適爽凉的程度，那倒也不亞於最優等的汗杉哩！</p>
<h3>夏日的故鄉佳肴</h3>
<p>— 秋郎</p>
<p>爲了生活的驅使到上海來，忽忽已十年以上了，但每到「日長如小年」的炎夏，總使我懷念故鄉杭州，尤其是戰後的故鄉，已成了個什麼樣兒？故鄉的秀水明山，固然時縈魂夢，便是故鄉的風味，也是很馳名的，現在雖不能嘗到，但回憶那津津之味，大有張季應蒓鱸之感，每會把涎沫掛在口角上哩。</p>
<p>風肉：風肉是杭州的名產，夏日佐餐的珍品，因爲沒有鮮肉的滑膩，它是濃香腴美鮮而不膩的，用來煮冬瓜最為相宜，佐飯下酒，遠滕其他菜肴，杭　醃臘舖雖都有出售，但受推清河坊萬隆棧最為馳名，因為他們腌製時的香料，配得非常準足，所以特別受人歡迎，外鄉人到杭州區，一定要買些帶回去的。</p>
<p>雙挿瓜：雙挿瓜亦是杭地的特產，有此味出售時間極短，杭俗各醬園以初伏開缸，中伏以後便已售磬，再有出售的稱爲二甜瓜了。雙揷瓜製法最著名的，應推惟和醬園，其他恒泰等園次之，瓜味鮮脆略甜，和其他醬瓜大不相同，最好用來佐粥或泡湯下飯，淸雋適口，倘欲將它藏起來，祇要和以白糖，在日光中晒乾，可以久藏不壞，而備不時之需，孤島人士，如欲嘗此二味，可向幾家售杭地土產的商店去購，不過價目當然昂貴一些，好在上海人是硏究吃的，但求嘗新，區區的價目，決不致計較的</p>
<h3>居住在夏天</h3>
<p>— 梅子</p>
<p>居住在夏天，最感討厭，因爲除了一般資產隆級以外，大部份都是住得像鳥籠般的擠軋，大概普通一幢房子，要住上五六家是常事，最少也得二三家，甚之有的還將擱樓，晒台間，灶間等都出租一空，這在春秋冬三季還可勉强軋軋，可是在夏天却苦了，非但空氣談不到，且連通風的地方都不大有，所以若不想想辦法，其苦處必更感難受，茲將筆者所想到的幾點寫出來，或可稍供參考吧？</p>
<p>（一），打掃淸潔。窒旣低小，很便於打掃，須天天勤於灑掃，務使不留一絲灰塵，掃後再澆些臭藥水消毒，垃圾須隨時倒掉，如此簡接亦可减少臭虫等的產生，並且在裏面也不會有「坐不住」之感。</p>
<p>（二），撲滅蚊蠅。飯菜等易引蒼蠅的食品，須用紗罩蓋住，其他如小孩吃的糖食等，也須分別放在盒內或瓶內，切勿隨便放在桌上，以免蟑螂蒼蠅的光顧，至於蚊虫，室內淸潔後自會减少。</p>
<p>（三），勿太貪凉。晚上睡後，至少須以薄被單蓋於腹部，寗可讓他熱得出汗，如此可免去秋天疾病發出，因此等疾病，都是在夏天貪凉所致的。</p>
<p>（四），洗浴問題。現在熱水漲至一分錢一勺，洗浴費亦頗可觀，故洗浴可逢酷暑時須大洗一下外，平時祗須揩揩上下身已可，蓋汗揩去了就很凉爽，所以落得省下這筆熱水費呢！</p>
<h3>「刳黃魚」</h3>
<p>— 金璧</p>
<p>航船幫中流行着一句隱語：「刳黃魚」。什麽叫「刳黃魚」呢？外行人大都被他們弄得莫明其妙，原來那是他們用以稱那些趁白船的客人的</p>
<p>「刳黃魚」的人大都是鄉下佬和苦力居多他們有的固然因爲賺錢非易，寗願捱打受辱，不願出錢乘船。（這種人以江北人爲最多）但大多是囊空如洗，在都市無法生存下去，回鄉又缺少路費；於是只好挺而走險，顧不得什麽面子不面子，實行刳黃魚」了。</p>
<p>另一種刳黃魚的人則幸運得多了；他們是與船上的茶房水手或燒飯司務，有同鄉或親戚的關係。他們原也無需「刳黃魚一，可是錢能省總想省一些的好，於是也走這一着了。但他們比前一種「刳黃魚」的人「放心得多，他們無需在軋票的來時和他捉迷藏似地兜圈子，他們儘可高枕無憂地臥在茶房水手或燒飯司務的舖上；當軋票的走過時，只要暫時蒙一會被頭，這樣就可以混過了。</p>
<p>在戰前，前一種「刳黃魚的人倘被發現了，船上人大都催逼他去補票。但當他實在拿不出錢的時候，則他們至多恫嚇着要剝掉他的衣裳，或用繩子裝着要綁他起來的樣子。當他們看見實在熬不出油來時，經旁人做好做歹的勸了一番，駡了幾聲也就算了。至於後一種刳黃魚的人，則大家都是自家入，旣有相熟的在船上，也就輕輕放過去了。</p>
<p>現在却不對了，以前在長江上內河裏行駛的大小船隻，差不多泰半給某方强佔去了。他們監視得很嚴厲，一切都不能通融。就是刳黃魚，前一種的也不能像以前那樣輕輕放渦了，相反地却常常受到辱駡和毒打。前幾大，有一隻開到北沙去的輪船，一個「刳黃魚」的江北人，聽說還嵌迫跳到長江裏去自盡呢。後一種一刳黃魚　的人，也小能像從前那樣放心了。聽說近來某方雷厲風行，船上如果發現了這種「刳黃魚一的人，則與他有關係的茶房水手或燒飯司務，也得受停生意的處分呢。</p>
<p>唉！就是刳黃魚也今非昔比了。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>

<h3>史達林的日常生活</h3>
<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>提起蘇聯，大家都知道史達林，他是共產黨的黨魁，也是蘇聯的政治中心人物，他不僅是一個國家的領袖，又是國際共產主義者的領袖。但是歐戰的局勢大變動以來，蘇聯也正在盡力擴大地盤，因此史達林的一舉一動都足以使世界人士屬目，這裏我記載一些關於他的日常生活。</p>
<p>史達林每晨六時前卽起身，洗臉後，便趨至克雷姆林園子裏散步十數分鐘，回來後，卽拆閱私人信札及報章，大約須費一小時的光陰，方能完畢。到了七時半，略進早餐，二塊麵包，一杯茶。八時，他就乘汽車到斯佛蘭拉去——中央委員會辦公處——他的辦公室，是很狹窄而無陳設的小間，他就在那半新舊的書桌上，聽取屬下人員的報吿，他總保守着沉默的態度，不大輕率發言，除非等到對方把話說完而完全洞悉對方所說的眞意時，然後下其批斷。九時起，乃正式辦公，一直到下午二時才進午餐，緊急時，時間更要多些，在午餐時，他便把烟斗放在手邊，乘上菜的當兒抽吸，肴饌很簡單，不過他愛喝酒，喜歡肉食，湯或肉汁，最後吃些麵包。餐後，趁二三十分鐘的餘暇，散步廊前。</p>
<p>到了三時，他繼被辦公。通常在十時左右才完畢，回家吃晚餐。有時，他如不把一天工作辦畢，決不肯離開辦公室，必要時，甚至睡在他的辦公室中，不回家去。他曾經說過：「工作就是我的生活。」可見他怎樣忠於服務，但他在日常生活方面的享受，可說是極端質樸而平民化的。</p>
<p>總之，史達林每天很辛勞地辦十一小時的公，其餘的時間，都化在讀書，下棋，默思，著作上，有時赴歌劇塲聽歌劇，或電影院看電影，因此他的就寢時間總在午夜一時後，平均每天只睡五小時，然而他的體格，仍可比作呆重的花崗石。</p>

<h3>利與弊</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>本刊發表了兩篇基嚼敎男女靑年會補助淸寒學生的文字後日，昨接到梅畿君的「侵佔淸寒獎學金」一文，乃流君也來了一篇報告（均發表於後），這自然是値得注意的事實。</p>
<p>凡事有利必有弊，淸寒獎學金的創設，似乎是有百利而無一弊的，但是下面所發表的文字明明告訴我們，也不幸而發生弊端了。</p>
<p>要消除這種弊端，我同意梅畿君所提到的兩點。因爲它所發生關係的就祗有學校（機關）和學生，所以要消除這弊端當然是這雙方共同應負的責任。</p>
<p>如果你是一個家庭經濟狀况寬餘的學生，在各方面講，都不應該去塡寒無力升學者的惟一路途，反之，還應去資叻他們，以補學校機關獎金之不足。至於把侵佔得來的學費，浪費於聲色之塲，那更是要不得的罪狀。</p>
<p>設置淸寒學費的各學校機關，調查方面務須求得確實的情形，當然是不能忽略的，因爲這不是沽名釣譽之舉，但求額滿了事。你們所費的金錢與精神，一定要收得相等的代價。</p>
<p>希望這不良的現象，在雙方嚴密的檢討與執行下，迅速地消除，則淸寒學生幸甚，國家幸甚。</p>
<h3>領准考證處</h3>
<p>— 乃流</p>
<p>到靜安寺路的女靑年會去索得一張「申請救濟學生登記表」以後，費去我一個早晨的時間，忙着找保證人，校長，終於仔細地塡好了。下午，我就不願再等的去換取准考證。</p>
<p>人是相當的多，一小隊一小隊的學生不斷的在女靑年會的門口流進流出。尤其是索取申請書，也就是換取准考證的地方，學生們簇擁着把一個辦事員密密層層的包圍起來了。經過好一回的等待，我才得前進一步，於是摸出照片，成絨報告單和申請書。</p>
<p>辦事員漫不經心的問着我旁邊的一個：「是不是你自己的？」</p>
<p>「是。」</p>
<p>於是一張照片被貼在准考證上去，手續也就完了。</p>
<p>輪到了我，我就把所需的物件交給了辦事員，同時才得透出一口氣看看四周的人。那時我感到莫大的奇怪，因爲在我四周來換取准考證，十九看上去都是公子哥兒；那面一個穿着筆挺的白嗶嘰的西裝，這面一個把頭髮盪得有些像女人，更有……總之，從他們的服色舉動上，可以知道他們的家是決不至於會付不出學費的。女同學們也是這樣：塗腦脂，捲髮，以及別的種種極浪費的化裝品，我想，就是請她們把這些節省下來，也可以作一學期的書籍費了。</p>
<p>「申請救濟？補助費是爲你們而設的嗎？」我對這般公子小姐不禁生了一個妒忌的念頭。申請處的所以忙，領准考證的所以擠，我也怪到他們和她們的身上去了。我憎恨地在心裏說：「誰侵害我們窮學生的權利！」</p>
<p>完了手續，出來的時候我更看見一般「淸寒學生」穿着高跟皮鞋，和買一支棒冰解解熱。他們是欺騙還是白相相？</p>
<h3>游泳常識</h3>
<p>— 强</p>
<p>入水前先作幾分鐘和綏運動及深呼吸，可使四肢靈活。用棉花塞耳道，免生耳道炎。出水後行全身乾擦，可免受寒</p>
<p>不可單獨游泳，防無人救護。不可飽食後游泳，防妨礙消化。不可在激烈運動後游泳，防發抽筋危險。</p>
<p>如果在水中遇到四肢抽筋，最容易發生危險，應立卽出水，用手掌在患處按摩，或敷以熱水。</p>
<h3>圕員的苦衷（答乃流君）</h3>
<p>— 煒</p>
<p>讀了三日乃流君的大作，談到本館的缺點後，我們站在館員的立塲上除了慚愧工作的不週到外，更感謝乃流君給予我們很誠懇的指正。</p>
<p>的確，像乃流君所說那樣，本館閱覽室內常有甜睡讀者發現，當然最好的辦法希望這般睡午覺的讀者能明瞭公共塲的規則，勿妨害公衆利益爲前題，可是事實上不會有希望那樣的圓滿，因爲讀者間也有良莠不齊，所以免不了有這種情形產生。旣然這樣，那末要輪到管理人員的注意問題了；但是我們也有許多苦衷呢。因爲館方支出經濟有限，人力當然也有限，可是工作却一天天的忙起來，所以管理人員也不能如願的來分配工作：就像閱覽室只有一個管理員，他（或她）不但要管理出入人數，閱覽證數，而且又要書放書籍包裹。這三件工作，已不能使管理員時常離開崗位來找尋午睡或多拿讀物的讀者；而且凡午睡的讀者，大多很狡滑地睡在視綫不易見到的角落處，管理員就很難發現他們。所以我認爲最澈底的辦法，希望熱心的讀者們多多給予我們幫助，如果有上類情形時，希望讀者們互相勸告，否則告訴我們管理員來執行規則。這樣一來，我想一定可以得到很好的效果。當然這效果全是讀者所賜予館方的，不知乃流君及本館各讀者，以爲如何？不妨來試一下好嗎？</p>
<p>附帶要說的：本館最近實施查書以來，發現許多書籍被塗寫，少數被撕去，雖然還有補救的辦法，但是最要緊的還是要全體讀者們來實行養成護書的美德。另外也有一二位讀者認爲我們查書的不够愼密，要更詳細的查，這我們當然接受，而且過去現在甚至將來，我們始終站在做到「絕對正確」的原則下努力，這一點可以告慰於讀者們的。</p>
<p>最後我們仍盼望着讀者們多方面的指敎，總之，　是屬於大衆的！</p>
<h3>侵佔清寒獎學金</h3>
<p>— 梅畿</p>
<p>靑年會看到失學問題的極端嚴重，因此撥一部經費設置淸寒獎學金名額，以獎助家境淸寒品學兼優之學生，確是一般無力而有志升學的學生們的福音。現在有許多學校也有此舉，這當然是値得我們共襄的善舉。</p>
<p>可是有一般家境尙稱寬裕的學生，看到學校有此舉，往往存着自私的念頭：「我也不妨去請求試試，假使學校裏允許了，不是可白白的多拿到「筆費嗎？假使學校裏不答應，那也無妨。」他們不顧到經濟力薄弱的同學的升學問題，並且因爲他們是不費力地騙來的，所以同時這筆款子就會從他們手裏輕易濫用掉。</p>
<p>我們學校也設置淸寒獎學金名額，家境貧困或因受戰事影響的優秀同學而去請求的，固然是很多，但是有力升學的同學去請求的，也不在少數。校方審查當然不能十分周密，因此這些獎學金名額就也會被那些有力升學的同學所佔。</p>
<p>要知道各學校及各機關設置淸寒獎學金名額都是有限的，你佔據一個名額，其他眞眞淸寒的同學就少了一個名額？換句話說，就是多了一個失學的靑年。所以我希望以後各學校及各機關舉辦淸寒獎學金，應於審查方面，務須周密，以消除此種不良的現象。更希望申請獎學金者，先估量自己的家境，是否的確淸寒，然後去請求，切勿侵佔一般有志而無力升學的同學們的惟一學費。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第三章　對立的情報</p>
<p>他作詫異聲道：「奇怪，怎麼兩條光光的膀子，連手錶都不戴一隻？」</p>
<p>霍桑吐了一口烟，慢吞呑說：「這又是複雜問題的一環。」</p>
<p>倪金壽似不了解。「這話什麼意思？」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「本來是有的。你瞧，伊的左腕上不是有一條痕子嗎？不過不像是手錶，也許是手鐲。還有伊的左手的無名指上和耳朶上，都有戴過指環耳環的痕迹。伊身上雖沒有掙扎的傷痕，但耳朶孔上的血癊，却明明是取耳環時所留下的。」</p>
<p>這時那兩個扛夫正要把一條白單被掩蓋到屍體上去。倪金壽揮揮手阻止他們，蹲下了身子，向霍桑所說的幾處細瞧。我才明白我剛才所瞧見的伊的耳朶上的血　的來由。</p>
<p>倪金壽點點頭說：「不錯，這的確又多了一重麻煩。」</p>
<p>那單被蓋好以後，另外兩個扛夫便抬着舁床走出去。秦默齋跟在後面，走到門口，又回過頭來補充一句：</p>
<p>「霍先生，倪探長，我希望你們最後勝利！」</p>
<p>霍桑答道：「謝謝你，等到檢騐法醫的工作完畢，我也希望你早些報告倪探長。」</p>
<p>秦默齋點點頭。「好，不過白醫官今天「天亮有公事上眞茹去了，不知什麼時候回來。一有結果，我決不躭擱。」他走出去了。</p>
<p>這一度小小的紛擾結束以後，室中慘怖的空氣彷彿减少了些。霍桑又向金梅招招手，叫伊走近些。他和倪金壽也各回復了原座。倪金壽重新摸出他的紀事小冊來。</p>
<p>霍桑問道：「金梅，王小姐昨夜裏出去時戴的什麼首飾？」</p>
<p>那女僕好像思索了一下，答道：「我不曾留意，不過伊出去時常戴一隻鑲細鑽的金鐲，昨夜裏也許也戴出去的。」</p>
<p>「伊平日常戴一隻什麼戒指？」</p>
<p>「鑽戒，那粒鑽石有黃豆那麼大。」　（三八）</p>

<p>May the Spirit of Loyalty Endure for Eternity, Assisting in the Great Undertaking of Revival: He served as the vanguard in the Battle of Central Hubei, with the determination to sacrifice himself for righteousness, bravely intercepting and killing the enemy, suffering heavy injuries and bloodshed, yet still advancing relentlessly. He also earnestly encouraged the masses to be loyal to the nation, to avenge their humiliation, and to restore their homeland. He ultimately died a martyr due to his severe injuries. The entire army was saddened. The government, recalling his heroic deeds and deeply mourning his loss, should issue a clear order to commend him and hand him over to the Military Affairs Commission for preferential treatment. His life's achievements should be recorded and sent to the National History Museum to show the nation's deep remembrance of his loyal assistance. This order applies to (3) Army Commander Chen Ke bao of the 29th Army, who had long been on the battlefield and was known for his military service. Since he led the army, he vowed to protect the country. During the battles of Nanxun, he led his troops to fight bravely and repeatedly frustrated the Japanese offensive. Unfortunately, he died a martyr at the Lotus Pond position, which is deeply mourned. A clear order should be issued to commend him and hand him over to the Military Affairs Commission for preferential treatment. His life's achievements should be, unfortunately, killed in action during the Battle of Kunlun Pass. His death is deeply mourned and regretted. A special order is issued to commend him and hand him over to the Military Affairs Commission for preferential treatment, and his life's achievements will be recorded and sent to the National History Museum to comfort his heroic spirit and to inspire others.

<h3>Zhang Zizhong's Coffin Arrives in Chongqing, Receiving the Utmost Honor and Mourning</h3>
<p>Chongqing - General Zhang Zizhong, the Commander-in-Chief of a certain Chinese Army, was loyal, courageous, and outstanding, and had repeatedly established meritorious service. He was trusted by the central government. During the Battle of Henan and Hubei, on the day of Zhongxiang, he advanced north along the Hanshui River. The General led his troops to launch a flank attack first, followed by annihilation, achieving great victories and laying the foundation for victory. Unexpectedly, the fierce battle was still in progress, and the star of the General suddenly fell. He died heroically near Nanguadian on May 16th. When the tragic news arrived, the whole country was shocked and mourned. In addition to the grand ceremony of commendation by the central government and the holding of a memorial service and handling of all post-mortem mourning affairs on a selected date, it was decided to specially honor Zhang, who had made outstanding achievements and was promoted to Deputy Commander of the ××th Army in the spring of the 27th year, and was promoted to the rank of General of the Army. His responsibilities became heavier, and the General's heart to serve the country became even more urgent. During the Battle of Henan and Hubei, his meritorious achievements were remarkable, and they will last as long as the mountains and rivers of Han and Gao.</p>
<p>Circumstances of Death in Battle</p>
<p>General Zhang was extraordinarily brave, and it had become his unusual habit to lead his troops in every battle. This time, he died in the service of the country. During the recent Battle of Henan and Hubei, the left wing of the Japanese army surrounded Zhongxiang and advanced north. The General waited until most of them had passed before launching a fierce interception, winning every battle and being invincible. Corpses piled up like mountains on the western foothills of the Dahong Mountains, all of which were the great results of the General's fearless efforts. Afterwards, most of the group was surrounded by the Japanese army at Zao Yang. The remnants of the Japanese left-wing group broke through and fled. On the 16th, at Chen Shi, they arrived in Chongqing safely at Chen Shi today. Chairman Chiang personally led the Standing Committee of the Central Committee and the ministers to the river to welcome the coffin and preside over the funeral affairs. He also requested the Central Committee to issue a special order to Commander Zhang, a loyal and courageous man, to pay for the funeral expenses of 100,000 silver dollars, and at the same time to issue 50,000 silver dollars for the funeral expenses of Division Commander Zheng Shizhen. In addition to recording his life's achievements and sending them to the Political History Committee for preservation, Chairman Chiang will personally draft the deeds of Zhang and Zheng. The children of General Commander Zhang and Commander Zhong will be raised by the Central Executive Committee of the Party until they reach adulthood. The officers and soldiers who died at the same time will be investigated by their respective chiefs and given preferential treatment. It is hereby ordered that those who died in the same battle include Division Commander Zhong Yi. When Division Commander Zhong was defeated, he personally led a group of brave soldiers to intercept the retreating Japanese, fighting fiercely and killing countless enemies. The Japanese then used their full force to encircle them in layers. Zhong encouraged. The proposed plan is to formulate and promulgate the administrative guidelines for each county.

<h3>A Portion of the Nanyang Comfort Mission Arrives in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Chen Zhong led a dozen members of the Nanyang Comfort Mission and arrived in Hong Kong on the evening of the 6th to wait for a ship back to Nanyang. (Dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Lanzhou - Jiamu Yang Hutu Ke Tuo returned from Tibet and arrived in Ouladi, Xiahe County on the 4th. More than 10,000 Tibetans came to welcome him, and Jiamu comforted them one by one. They all retreated joyfully. Jiamu plans to rest there and is scheduled to return to Xilakaleng Temple on the 17th. (Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>National Government Issues a Clear Order to Commend Zhang Zizhong and Others; Zhang Zizhong is Posthumously Promoted to Army General; The Executive Yuan Decides to Enshrine Him in the Martyrs' Shrine</h3>
<p>Chongqing - National Government Order of the 7th: (1) The late Lieutenant General of the Army with the honorary title of Army General, Zhang Zizhong, is posthumously promoted to Army General. This order is issued. (2) Army General Zhang Zizhong, Commander-in-Chief of the 33rd Army, has long shouldered military responsibilities and has been known for his loyalty and integrity. After the Lugouqiao Incident, he fought on the front lines and repeatedly made outstanding contributions. His deeds are recorded and sent to the National History Museum to honor his loyalty and heroism. This order applies to (4) Division Commander Zheng Zuomin of the 9th Army, who was loyal and upright and held himself to high standards. He graduated from the Huangpu Military Academy at an early age and was determined to serve the country. Later, he followed the army in the Northern Expedition and immediately made meritorious service. Since the War of Resistance, he has led his troops in battles and repeatedly achieved. The proposal states that it is heard that prestige is proclaimed on the battlefield, and the tripod bells honor the loyalty of the great general. His spirit is as strong as the mountains and rivers, and he enjoys the worship of the ancestral hall in spring and autumn. Therefore, it is necessary to inspire the morale of the soldiers, make the tigers roar in the frontier, boost the morale of the army, and delight the souls of the dead. It is found that Commander-in-Chief Zhang Zizhong of the 33rd Army has made repeated meritorious contributions since the War of Resistance. In the battles of Linyi, Feishui, Taierzhuang, and Suizao, he was able to independently lead a battle and display his strategy. Recently, in northern Hubei and southern Henan, the Commander-in-Chief personally led a strong army and repeatedly won victories. He wanted to show the courage of a drum, not avoiding the danger of going deep into the enemy's territory. He sent a heroic army to cut off the Japanese retreat. Because the ratio of the number of people was too different, he calmly died for his country. Although the great star has fallen, his spirit will last forever. He has both success and benevolence. He has assisted the leader of the country and defended the Party-state. He is loyal and courageous, and does not hesitate to sacrifice himself. He should be enshrined in the Martyrs' Shrine to comfort his heroic spirit. The brave deeds of the martyrs will be revealed at home and abroad to show their loyalty and heroism and to pay tribute to them.</p>
<p>The General's Experiences</p>
<p>General Zhang's name is Zizhong, also known as Jinchen, and he is from Linqing County, Shandong Province. He was born with loyalty and had a strong sense of integrity. In his youth, he studied law and politics and deeply understood the importance of governing the country, that military preparedness comes first. Therefore, he abandoned his pen and joined the army. For more than ten years in the army, he always had a book in his hand and was as gentle as a Confucian scholar. However, his diligence, prudence, integrity, and his courage and decisiveness in times of crisis were unmatched even by ancient famous generals. In the fifth year of the Republic, he served under Mr. Feng Huanzhang. Commander Feng talked with him and was very impressed. He was promoted from platoon leader to division commander. His outstanding achievements in the Battle of Xifengkou were praised by the world. He was extremely strict with himself and generous with others. He later served as Chairman of Chahar Province and Mayor of Tianjin. In the midst of complex government affairs, he did not forget to train soldiers. When the July 7th Incident occurred, he was promoted to army commander. At the Leiba Drum Shandong Foothills area, the general led a part of a certain division and pursued the Japanese on light horses. He was unexpectedly ambushed by the Japanese counterattack, and was suddenly shot in the left arm. People asked him to return to the camp for treatment, but the general resolutely refused and still fought bravely as before, from noon to the end, before finally defeating the remnant Japanese. Unfortunately, he was shot in the chest again. The general knew that he had been seriously injured, so he drew the short sword given to him by the chairman, intending to kill himself. He was seized by his adjutant, Zhu. The general then said to his subordinates with emotion, "My conscience is clear to the country, the nation, the commander, and myself. Everyone must work harder for the country." After saying these words, he died.</p>
<p>Post-Mortem Honors</p>
<p>When the general's coffin arrived in Chongqing, it was personally welcomed by the President and received the utmost honor and mourning. The Military Affairs Commission issued a telegram that said, "The coffin of General Commander Zhang Zizhong of the ×th Army inspires his subordinates. We, as soldiers, should resist desperately at this critical moment. If necessary, we should keep a bullet for ourselves to drink." At that time, only forty to fifty people were left in Zhong's unit, and the Japanese attacked with nearly a thousand cavalry. As a result, all of them sacrificed themselves one after another. Their loyalty, courage, and perseverance were no less than that of Zhang. In addition, there were Division Commander Zheng Zuomin, who died for his country in the Battle of Kunlun Pass, and Army Commander Chen Anbao, who sacrificed himself for the country in the Battle of Nanchang. Their heroic and moving deeds are too numerous to mention. (Dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>The Enmity Between Britain and France and the Future of World Affairs</h3>
<p>Since Nazi Germany employed its original blitzkrieg strategy in this European war and repeatedly achieved great results, military theory has undergone a sudden change and promoted opportunities for comprehensive innovation. As a result, various treacherous and abrupt events have occurred in the international arena, like unpredictable thunder and rain. This is none other than an implied effect of the blitzkrieg strategy, and this style has expanded from the purely military field to the political and diplomatic spheres. For example, the British Navy's sudden attack on French warships in North Africa on the third day of this month, and the worsening of Anglo-French relations, is another most shocking scene since the French armistice. World affairs are becoming increasingly intense, and everything is beyond the grasp of common sense, normal feelings, and general reason. Furthermore, the more the chaos spreads, the more acute the conflicts become, and the debate over theory and right and wrong will inevitably become more chaotic until it becomes impossible to investigate. Then, both sides of the warring countries will gradually abandon their attacks and contentions based on white and black, and turn to fighting for life and death. As the saying goes, "When life comes to this, there is no point in discussing the ways of heaven." The unprecedented catastrophe of the world's population is now in full swing.</p>
<p>The British warships' action in North Africa this time is probably the first time the Allied forces have taken the initiative to attack since the outbreak of the European war last fall. The results achieved are far beyond those of the Battle of the Falkland Islands in South America. Although this is only a scene of a friendly alliance turning into hostility, not a direct confrontation between hostile countries, we cannot but recognize the significant military achievement of the British side this time, regardless of whether France and Britain will eventually go from breaking off diplomatic relations to fighting each other. If the announcements issued by the British side after the event do not contain exaggeration, then more than half of the French navy, known as the second in Europe, has been taken into British hands or destroyed. Compared with the combined strength of the British navy today and the remnants of the German, Italian, and French navies that can be used by Germany and Italy, Britain has an absolute advantage. After France and Germany made peace, the French navy issue, which was of common concern to the world, has now come to an end. After the trials of the South American and Mediterranean campaigns, it is further confirmed that Britain's maritime authority cannot be easily underestimated.</p>
<p>Even if the British naval power is very strong, it cannot be hastily concluded that it is sufficient to guarantee the safety of Britain and the chances of victory in the war. Due to the progress of three-dimensional warfare tactics in recent years, the power of naval vessels at sea has been greatly reduced. The German navy is not developed, and now it is almost completely destroyed, but its air force can often cause trouble for the invincible British navy. The sinking of the British aircraft carrier Glorious in the waters of Narvik is one example. On the other hand, there are still many military experts in various countries who admire the functions of warships and despise the role of the air force at sea. It is said that the British military aircraft are indeed superior in performance to those used by Germany and Italy, but the quantity is far from sufficient. Therefore, in the subsequent Anglo-German war situation, the main struggle will be the British navy's decisive battle against the German and Italian air forces. Its merits and demerits, as well as the position of the sea and air forces in today's war, still need to be proven by future facts. As for the new situation caused by the deterioration of Anglo-French relations in various parts of the world, it is even more complicated. The saying that the Pétain government has declared war on Britain is now rampant. If it unfortunately becomes a reality, it will further increase the strangeness and complexity of the current war situation. It may not have a major impact on the military aspect, but the stimulation it adds to the psychology of the world will be profound and enormous, and will increasingly make people aware of the impermanence of international separation, alliance, and enmity today. After France, a first-class power, suddenly suffered defeat, its national policy formed a huge angle of change. The feelings of its authorities and the situation of its people are difficult to imagine. And the French colonies in various parts of the world, since the peace between France and Germany, various units have had their own opinions. Their movements are still not very clear. After this incident, their orientation and trend will become more subtle. In the Near East, Britain and France have stationed heavy troops. The areas of North Africa have had military joint defense in the past. The territories of both sides are closely connected and their interests are similar, especially in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans and the colonies in South Asia. In the difficult situation of the new and old continents, they have the importance of affecting the whole body with a single hair. Its impact has far exceeded the gains and losses of the European war itself. This is what the world should pay special attention to.</p>
<p>The European war has lasted for ten months so far, and now it has entered the decisive stage of close combat. During these ten months, the change in the map of Europe and the change in the national conditions of various countries have been faster and more dramatic than any era in European history. The struggle will be more tragic and the changes will be faster. I don't know what kind of strange and different traces will be created to decorate this tragic era. It is hoped that the warring countries will be able to stop in moderation, not go too far, and not be too concerned about the grievances and revenge, so as to avoid sowing the seeds of renewed killing for the next generation of people. Then, although the destruction of the war is said to be tragic, it is not merely a sacrifice without value.</p>
<h3>Third Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction: Central Government Joint Commemoration, Chairman Lin Delivers Speech Explaining Three Points</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Today is the third anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. The Central Party Headquarters and the National Government jointly held a commemoration ceremony at the National Government Auditorium at 6:00 AM. Over 500 people, including members of the Central Committee and heads of various agencies, attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony, and three minutes of silence were observed for the soldiers who died in the war and the compatriots who perished. The ceremony was solemn and respectful. After the silence, Chairman Lin delivered a speech (Commemoration Speech for the Third Anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction). After the speech, the ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Lin's speech briefly stated that on this day in the previous year, the first anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, I had expressed several points of view, concluding that (victory in the War of Resistance is certain) and (national reconstruction will surely succeed). These are inevitable outcomes that we should not doubt or hesitate about. Now, two full years have passed in the War of Resistance. During these two years, there have been many changes in military, political, and international affairs. Although these changes are complex, they all ultimately prove this conclusion. Now, I will briefly explain this point of view. First, regarding the military aspect, we have moved from a passive position to an active one, from a stalemate to an offensive position. We are indeed getting stronger with each battle. This has been the case in the past, and it will inevitably be even more advantageous for us in the future. This can be inferred. Therefore, in terms of the military, we can confidently say that our difficult period has passed. The situation will undoubtedly improve day by day. I hope that our loyal and brave soldiers and the compatriots of the entire nation will remain steadfast in their faith and continue to work hard to achieve final victory. Second, regarding the political aspect, the Japanese have long known that they are mired in a military quagmire, so they have had to change their tactics and make every effort to attack politically. However, their political offensive can be said to have yielded no results. Third, regarding the international aspect, the international changes in the past year have been unprecedented. The war clouds in Europe are dense, and the causes, consequences, rights, and wrongs are complex and cannot be explained in a few words. We do not need to discuss them now. However, in this great war, we can clearly recognize that in today's age of scientific advancement, if the military strength of both sides is not evenly matched, they must rely on the loyalty and patriotism of their people to win. A country with inferior military equipment can be assured of victory if it maintains a strong will and fights bravely. As you all know, in the European theater, some countries perished in less than a day, and some surrendered in a few months. They could not maintain their main force in the war of resistance, and their faith in the war of resistance wavered, leading to a complete collapse. I believe that the greatest difficulty for a country with inadequate military equipment fighting against a country with strong military equipment is in the initial stages of the war, and the most important weapon is the psychology of the people. If there are any errors in the initial strategy or if the national character is slightly weak, they will inevitably succumb to the path of surrender due to being unable to withstand setbacks. It cannot be denied that our national defense was not very strong in the past. However, as a result of the three years of the War of Resistance, our strength in the War of Resistance has only increased day by day and never decreased. The spirit of resistance throughout our nation has only become more solid and never wavered. From this, it can be seen that the combat skills of our loyal and brave soldiers and the national character of our compatriots are not only comparable to those of the advanced countries in Europe, but also worthy of great confidence. The difficult initial stages of the war have long passed, as mentioned above. Moreover, judging from the international situation, it further strengthens our confidence in the War of Resistance. From now on, as long as we work hard according to the established policy and persevere, the ultimate victory is beyond doubt. The above three points are very simple and straightforward explanations of (victory in the War of Resistance) and (national reconstruction will surely succeed). In particular, the international situation is our best lesson. I can even say that the various situations in the military, political, and international aspects in the past year have all served as factual proof of my (victory in the War of Resistance) and (national reconstruction will surely succeed). Today, on this anniversary, I am speaking to you all specifically. (7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Kong Xiangxi and Others Publish Essays</p>
<p>Chongqing - Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, recently published an article on the occasion of the third anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, explaining the state of China's finances after three years of the War of Resistance. The article stated that the reason why China's finances have been able to remain stable is due to the following factors: (1) The government established a solid foundation before the war; (2) There have been abundant harvests in the past three years; (3) Funds have been used effectively; (4) Remittances from overseas Chinese have been substantial; (5) Sympathy and assistance from foreign countries have been continuous. (6th Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>Chongqing - General Chen Cheng, Director of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, recently published a commemorative essay on the third anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, advocating that the Chinese army should have two to three years of preparation before adopting an offensive in China. He stated, "Those who demand an immediate counter-offensive are making judgments that are too hasty. Once a full-scale counter-offensive begins, it cannot be completed in a few months. I believe that our army is already in an offensive position at this time, which is completely different from a purely defensive position." (6th Dispatch from Havas)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Today, mass rallies are being held throughout China to pay respects to the Chinese soldiers who died in the war. Flags are hung on all buildings, and decorated arches have been built on the roads. Special delegations are visiting various military hospitals and the families of front-line officers and soldiers to offer condolences. Today has the atmosphere of a national holiday and is called "National War of Resistance and Revival Day." All newspapers have published commemorative articles written by military and civilian leaders. Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui gave a radio speech, stating that no matter how the international situation develops, China will continue to resist. Foreign Minister Wang also warned the great powers that Japan is gradually taking over the interests of foreigners in the Far East. He also mentioned that Japan is now putting pressure on Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Burma, and is also making demands on foreign concessions in order to block China's international trade lines. Economic Minister Weng Wenhao's speech continued to describe the development of domestic defense industries. It is said that there are now three steel plants whose steel production is sufficient to meet China's military needs. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin recounted the major military events in the Sino-Japanese War. (7th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Today, China has entered the fourth year of the Sino-Japanese War. China's resistance has become more determined, and it is increasingly confident in its ability to develop military industries and in the ineffectiveness of Japan's economic blockade. Government leaders have made public statements on the third anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident, believing that Japan has lost its main driving force and has changed its offensive to a defensive posture. They all read that since the Japanese army occupied Nanjing, the Japanese have never gained an important strategic location in China. In summary, the words of Chinese leaders generally stated that, politically, China has made progress on the road to democracy during these three years of resistance, while Japan is abandoning its parliamentary politics and returning to anarchy. Economically, Japan's blockade has become ineffective because China is already manufacturing its own weapons and ammunition to cope with this undeclared war, and heavy industries have been established in many areas not occupied by the Japanese army. China will receive more international sympathy and assistance. Japan, which is changing its foreign policy as the world situation changes, only sees itself becoming increasingly isolated.

<h3>Ciano Arrives in Berlin, Important German-Italian Talks Begin, Diplomatic and Military Plans for Closer Cooperation, Rumors that the Two Foreign Ministers Will Also Visit Moscow</h3>
<p>Berlin - German leader Hitler received Foreign Minister Ciano at the Chancellery at 12:30 PM today. Ciano was accompanied to Hitler's study by Dusburg, Mesner, and Hitler's adjutant Bormann.

Ciano is scheduled to depart for Italy on the evening of the 11th. (7th Dispatch from Haitong)</p>
<p>Berlin - An official statement this afternoon stated that Hitler received Ciano this afternoon and had a long conversation. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Ambassador to Italy Mackensen, and Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri were also present. (7th Dispatch from Haitong)</p>
<p>Budapest - A dispatch from Berlin said that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is now traveling to Berlin and will continue his journey to another important capital. It is likely that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will accompany him. People here are very interested in this news, believing that the other important capital refers to Moscow. (7th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome - Today, the "Italian News" newspaper commented on Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Germany, strongly asserting that this visit has very great importance because it is taking place at an important historical juncture, proving that the Axis countries have close cooperation in diplomatic, economic, military, and political affairs. Every meeting between Hitler and Mussolini has brought further progress to the fate of Europe, and it is hoped that this time will have the same result. (7th Dispatch from Haitong)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital - Political figures here believe that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Berlin will involve very important military and political negotiations, so they are paying close attention to it. According to a report from the Rome correspondent of the local newspaper, well-informed sources in Rome said that an attack on Britain would be the main topic of discussion between Italy and Germany. Regarding the conflict between Britain and France, Germany and Italy will discuss how to assist France in dealing with Britain. It is widely believed that the Balkan issue will not be discussed for the time being because Germany is now focusing on issues more important than the Balkans.

<h3>Rumors That Germany Will Launch a Large-Scale Attack on Britain Within Ten Days, Aerial Slaughter as Its Strategy</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital - German sources recently predicted that Germany will launch a blitzkrieg against Britain within ten days. Next Tuesday may be the day to launch this attack. It is also predicted that German aircraft will continuously bomb London for six days, dropping more than 3,000 bombs each day. These bombing aircraft will use previously unused methods. During the air raid, many bombers will be equipped with bomb-carrying gliders. This device can be released far from the target. After six days of continuous bombing, paratroopers will land in Britain to fight. (7th Dispatch from United Press)</p>
<p>London - Today, both the Sunday Observer and The Times discussed the possibility of Britain being invaded. Garvin also published an article in the Observer, strongly asserting the need to maintain air superiority over the "island fortress" in the coming critical weeks. In his book "How to Fight—Opinions on Being Invaded," Garvin said that the main goals of German strategy are to confuse the British fleet, disperse the British air force, and induce Britain to waste its military strength. A more knowledgeable writer on the German side explained the meaning of concentrating attacks on a dispersed defense. The enemy's principle of action is persistence, but their implementation is flexible. The German General Staff uses speed, weight, and direction to shock the opponent with an unprecedented level of dedication. In the war of attacking Britain, the Germans will use various methods to seize all of our land in order to disperse Britain's defensive forces. The most important event for us is to find a way to arrange our military deployment so that the most powerful attack can move in any direction with the special speed of modernization. In the middle of the war, there may be various unprecedented totals and adventures. In the midst of contradictory information, we must quickly distinguish between falsehood and the difference between subsidized attempts and real dangers. We must resist the enemy's main military attack and destroy it. Our own doctrine must be offensive in nature, not passive defense. We must remember that all of our assets, our sea power today, are of unprecedented greatness. In a sense, Britain is still an island, surrounded by oceans, which do not allow the enemy to carry out military aggression on the same scale as on the continent. The German invasion of Britain is completely different from the conquest of Europe, so we must not misunderstand the maritime situation. In addition, there is a major air problem, which is the decisive area. The enemy's preferred means of aggression is aerial slaughter, bombing ports and munitions factories. Hitler has relied on his superior air power from the beginning, and this time he will use all his strength. Hitler may stake most of his reserve forces on this one move, so in the next six weeks, the hope and life of the nation will depend on the immortal achievements of our air force's combat and technical quality.

<h3>Britain Intensifies Efforts to Strengthen National Defense</h3>

As far as the reporter knows, another batch of reservists has been called up, and all men capable of fighting will immediately enlist. The newly called-up men are from the 1909 class, totaling 1 to 2 million people, so the strength of the British forces has now greatly increased. (7th Dispatch from International News Service)</p>

<h3>Japanese Students' Families Mostly Unwilling to Wage War Against the United States; Responses to Inquiries from the University Professors' Association Show Majority Also Favor a Single Political Party</h3>
<p>Tokyo, today's news: The University Professors' Association of Japan recently inquired of students' families, asking whether Japan should wage war against the United States if the United States interfered with Japan and prevented it from obtaining war materials from the Dutch East Indies. The result was that only 14% of those surveyed favored Japan going to war with the United States. A total of 45,666 families were surveyed, and only 11,789 responded. Among those who responded, 40% still advocated not going to war with the United States, 6,247 favored war with the United States, and 1,334 strongly opposed Japan going to war with the United States. The children of these families are students at prominent universities in Japan. The opinions of these families generally seem to suggest that Japan should not get involved in the European war as a means of resolving the Sino-Japanese War. Among the 11,789 who responded, 30% were unwilling to wage war against the United States, 1,508 advocated getting involved in the European war, and 7,255 expressed extreme opposition. In response to the question of whether Japan should conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union to facilitate the construction of a "New Order in East Asia," only 15% of these families responded. Among them, 1,181 favored a treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union, and 531 strongly opposed it. Furthermore, Japanese students' families mostly hope that Germany will defeat Britain, with only 344 favoring a British victory, while 9,697 favor backing Germany. Regarding the political party issue, the majority of families favor a single political party. Among them, only 389 favor the existing political party system, while 6,939 favor a single-party system.

<h3>British Newspaper Observes International Situation; Possibility of World Powers Forming Great Blocs</h3>
<p>London: The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Observer claims that diplomatic circles are now openly discussing the possibility of a realignment of world powers into great blocs. One is a Southern Catholic Europe, including France, Spain, and Italy, with the potential to include Rhineland Bavaria in Germany and its 30 million Catholic population. The former Prime Minister of France and member of the Pétain government, Laval, has been working on this plan for years. This bloc would naturally be anti-British, anti-Prussian, and anti-Soviet. Another bloc would consist of Britain, the Soviet Union, and the United States, with the aim of resisting Germany's ambition to dominate Europe and Japan's ambition to dominate the Far East. The correspondent also mentioned the meeting between Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky and British Prime Minister Churchill on July 3, stating that this meeting was at least partly related to the military and diplomatic complications arising from Romania's entry into Germany's embrace in the Near East. The Soviet side believes that in order to defend against German incursions into the Black Sea, it is impossible to ignore the Mediterranean Sea and other such incidents.

<h3>Alexandria French Fleet Disarmed Without Resistance; Implemented Smoothly with Mutual Understanding; "Dunkerque" Runs Aground and is Hit by Six Bombs</h3>
<p>London: Colonel Jones, the former British leader of the delegation to Syria, delivered a broadcast today from Cairo to his former comrades, revealing for the first time the details of the disarming of the French fleet in Alexandria without resistance. He said that the disarming of the French fleet in Alexandria was implemented smoothly and with mutual understanding, which is attributable to the friendship between the British and French sailors. According to French sources in Algeria, as a result of the British operation in Mers-el-Kébir, three large French ships and one small ship have run aground. Only 200 survivors were found from the French battleship "Bretagne" (its normal crew was 1,133). The ship is now in the harbor. In addition, on two battleships, the "Dunkerque" and "Provence," and the destroyer Mogador, there were a total of 200 deaths, 150 serious injuries, and one missing person. (Reuter's dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>London: The British Admiralty stated that the French battlecruiser "Dunkerque" was damaged as a result of the British fleet's action on July 3 and ran aground in Mers-el-Kébir. The extent of the damage is unknown, but it is seriously damaged and cannot participate in battle even if it falls into enemy hands. After the engagement in Mers-el-Kébir, the French fleet commander sent a signal stating that the ship had lost its combat capability and ordered the crew to abandon ship. In view of the French commander's declaration ordering the crew to abandon ship, the British considered it unnecessary to issue a warning before continuing to attack the "Dunkerque." Yesterday morning, British aircraft attacked this French ship and scored six hits. Two British aircraft did not return. The "Dunkerque" was built in 1935, with a displacement of 26,500 tons, carrying a crew of 1,381, and a speed of 29-31 knots. It is one of the fastest capital ships afloat. The ship has heavy armor and is armed with eight 13-inch guns, sixteen 5-inch guns, and forty-four other smaller caliber guns. (Reuter's dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<h3>American Aircraft Reconnoiter North Sea</h3>
<p>An airfield somewhere in Britain: Yesterday, American-made reconnaissance aircraft were flying over the North Sea, performing reconnaissance duties for the British Royal Air Force. These aircraft flew back and forth over the coasts of the Netherlands and Belgium and the ports of Norway, searching for German troops, aircraft, and warships that Hitler planned to use to invade England. Journalists learned from British, Canadian, South African, and retired aviators that this type of Lockheed aircraft is a formidable weapon in aerial combat. Its bomb bay is located in the belly of the aircraft, and machine guns are placed in the front and rear of the aircraft, using electric and hydraulic power to allow the machine guns to fire in all directions. This Lockheed aircraft was the first to drop bombs on Norway, and the first to bomb the oil tanks in Bremen and Hamburg was also this aircraft. This aircraft can engage with any type of German aircraft, and in every battle, it performs better than other aircraft. The German Messerschmitt has not yet shot down one of these aircraft. Now, this aircraft has become an important tool for Britain to defend against the enemy, its mission being to destroy Hitler's attempt to besiege England. (Associated Press dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<h3>President Roosevelt Publicly Issues Statement; Elaborates on Monroe Doctrine; Territorial Issues Should be Resolved Through Consultation; Similar Attitude Towards Europe and Asia</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt publicly issued a statement last night stating that he, on behalf of the United States, reiterates that the country has no territorial ambitions abroad and expresses his appreciation for the support of various countries in Europe and Asia for the United States' Monroe Doctrine. The statement said that the redistribution of territories after the European war should be done through consultations between various continents or hemispheres. The President authorized his secretary, Mr. O'Reilly, to issue the following statement on the principle of "The Americas belong to the Americans, Europe belongs to the Europeans, and Asia belongs to the Asians": "The United States has absolutely no intention of interfering in the territories of Europe and Asia. What the government wants to see and implement is that every continent in the world can establish its own 'Monroe Doctrine.' The United States will not seek to acquire new territories, nor does it have such intentions. However, should a victorious Germany demand territory within this hemisphere from the countries it has conquered, we will consider that move to be in conflict with our Monroe Doctrine. According to that doctrine, the United States will not take any islands belonging to the defeated countries, but believes that the best way to dispose of these territories is to have the countries of the Americas decide publicly. Regarding French Indochina, the government believes that it is best to have all the countries of Asia sit down and consider various proposals regarding that island, and the same goes for Europe." Finally, the statement proposed that the Pan-American Conference to be held in Havana on July 20 should discuss the disposal of colonies in this hemisphere belonging to various defeated European countries. At the same time, the State Department announced that the Executive Committee of the Pan-American Conference has formally endorsed the three principles of the Havana Conference: neutrality, protection of peace in the Western Hemisphere, and economic cooperation. (Associated Press dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3>United States Considers Asian Nations Should Decide on French Indochina</h3>
<p>Hyde Park: President Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. O'Reilly, issued a statement to reporters yesterday, stating that the Monroe Doctrine should be applied to Europe and Asia as a tool to establish an agreement regarding the disposal of the territories of defeated countries. Mr. O'Reilly said that he was relaying the President's opinion. Mr. O'Reilly's remarks were made after President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull discussed the exchange of notes between the United States and Germany regarding the interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. According to Mr. O'Reilly, the President believes that the countries of Europe, Asia, and the Americas should each convene meetings within their own areas and resolve territorial issues themselves, rather than allowing the victorious countries to decide arbitrarily. Mr. O'Reilly supported Secretary Hull's declaration that the United States should continue to implement the Monroe Doctrine, saying that if Germany demands all the territories of France, Britain, and the Netherlands in the Western Hemisphere, the United States does not intend to make efforts to take over these territories but will invite the countries of the Americas to decide whether to place these territories under a trusteeship system until they can be returned to their original owners. Mr. O'Reilly also said that the President stated that the United States has no intention of interfering in land issues related to the adjustment of Europe or Asia. What the American government wants to see, and what it believes should be, is the implementation of the Monroe Doctrine in Europe and Asia, which is consistent with the interpretation and implementation of this doctrine in the Western Hemisphere. As an example, regarding French Indochina, the United States believes that all the countries of Asia should consult and reach a decision. The disputes in Europe and Asia should be resolved by the countries of Europe and Asia themselves, while the disposal and management of the islands and other territories of the countries conquered by Germany within the Western Hemisphere should be resolved by the countries of the Americas. A reporter asked if Germany held the view that the Monroe Doctrine would only be effective if the United States did not interfere in European affairs. Mr. O'Reilly replied that he was talking about the transfer of territorial ownership, while the German note, as far as he knew, was about political interference. In other words, the United States and Germany seemed to have different opinions on the interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine. (Reuter's dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3>United States Watching Situation in the West Indies; Warships Sail to Martinique</h3>
<p>Washington: American warships set sail today for the French island of Martinique in the Caribbean Sea. The island currently has several French warships, which have raised fears of British and French battles occurring in the American neutrality zone. It is reported that several neutral patrol destroyers left St. Thomas Island in the Virgin Islands last night, ordered to investigate the situation around Martinique. Officials here say that the American ships will strictly adhere to the role of observers, and one of their important missions is to warn American ships in the area in the event of a conflict between Britain and France in Martinique. French naval power on the island includes several submarines, several small surface warships, and the unconfirmed report of the aircraft carrier "Béarn." The French Navy appeared to be awaiting the second step of the British Navy's actions last night, believing that the British would demand that the French forces surrender, agree to cooperate with Britain to sink their warships, or go to war. French diplomats here said that the situation has temporarily stalled, and the French authorities in Martinique have announced that they are affiliated with the Pétain government, which signed a peace treaty with Germany. (Associated Press dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>Washington: The British Navy is now blockading a French aircraft carrier and several submarines off the island of Martinique. It is reported that the US Navy has dispatched five destroyers to rush to the vicinity of the island to investigate the current situation. Mr. Hull said that the United States' "neutral patrol" is now clearing the seas and detecting lurking warplanes at the doorstep of the United States. Although British officials do not recognize the blockade of Martinique, if the French ships are ordered to return to their home ports and risk entering international waters, the British Navy may intercept them. Mr. Hull also said that the republics of the Americas are currently watching the development of the situation on the island in order to take joint action.

<h3>Japan Anxious Over U.S. Embargo</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Based on the law recently signed by U.S. President Roosevelt, the President has the right to order a ban on the export of any military supplies that are needed for U.S. defense. The Asahi Shimbun recently published an article commenting on the consequences, stating that the Japanese business community is extremely concerned about this matter and believes that the only way to deal with it is to establish a self-sufficient system among the countries of the Japanese financial group. Although the enactment of this new U.S. law may not worsen the current business relationship between Japan and the United States, Japan cannot help but feel great anxiety about the future of this matter. Officials of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry even believe that if relations between Japan and the United States become strained in the future, President Roosevelt can use the powers granted by this law as "a powerful and effective tool to deal with Japan." However, some well-informed sources say that, as far as the current situation is concerned, President Roosevelt's signing of this law is different from a genuine blockade of military supplies exports. For example, the U.S. government once announced a ban on the export of machine tools, and at that time, some people worried that American-made machine tools would completely disappear, but the fact proved that, except for those that directly conflicted with the needs of American industry, others were still exported as usual.

<h3>New York Times on Australia's Future; Has Significant Relationship with the United States</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Times published an editorial today on Australia's future, saying that as long as the danger of British sea power being destroyed has not been eliminated, and as long as Japan continues its ambitions to dominate Asia, Australia's position will require the consideration of the United States, or require a major decision by the United States. The existence of the democratic federations of Australia and New Zealand, in many ways, will be more important to us in the coming years than the Dutch East Indies and the Philippines. Australia and New Zealand can help ensure that the flame of democracy never goes out, no matter what happens to the Old World, and the value of these two places will not change. Therefore, we should often think about their position today and think hard about it. (Reuter's dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3>Hull to Attend Pan-American Conference; Establishment of Air Force Bases to be One of the Issues Discussed</h3>
<p>Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Hull told reporters that he will attend the conference in the Cuban capital, where about ten to fifty issues will be discussed, and the establishment of U.S. Air Force bases in Latin America will be one of them. Information is currently being collected on the British blockade of the French West Indian port of Martinique to continue the policy of continuing to discuss common economic, political, and military issues to defend against factual or threatened dangers. The British and French embassies in the United States have both stated that they have not received news of the port being blockaded. However, one British official said that since the beginning of the war, British ships have been patrolling near the West Indies. (Reuter's dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<h3>US Industrial Centers Intensify Security to Prevent Explosive Sabotage</h3>
<p>Washington – According to a reporter's investigation, the United States federal authorities are secretly working to strengthen day and night security at industrial centers across the country to prevent sabotage. Due to the occurrence of several serious bombing cases in the past week, the authorities are stepping up precautions to guard against America's "Fifth Column." The Federal Bureau of Investigation has significantly expanded its investigative capabilities due to recent Congressional approval of additional funding, recruiting 600 new detectives. Another 100 are currently undergoing training in Quantico. News has also just been received from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, that three individuals plotted to bomb the DuPont company, whose capital amounts to 200 million yuan. Fortunately, an anonymous phone call foiled the plan. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is now apprehending these three, who were attempting to bury explosives under the factory wall. The police arrived promptly upon receiving the tip, and the three abandoned four crates of explosives and fled. As for the bombing case at the British Pavilion at the New York World's Fair on July 4th, the New York Police Department is making every effort to investigate and apprehend the bomber. On May 29th, a tall, dark man stole 30 crates of explosives from a construction site. This man appears to be Irish and is highly suspected of criminal activity. (July 7th International Dispatch)</p>

<h3>New Romanian Prime Minister Broadcasts, Declaring Pro-German Policy; Adopts Intense Attitude Towards the Soviet Union; Anti-British Sentiment Progressing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Bucharest – In his broadcast speech today, the new Romanian Prime Minister, Gigurtu, announced that conducting Romania's foreign policy within an "Axis" framework is an established fact. He also stated, "We are returning to Romania's old traditions through this policy. These traditions were previously disrupted by events that can no longer be implemented and were forced behind by the times. Now, joining the Axis is equivalent to a complete change in the internal political structure, controlled by an effective and creative nationalistic concept." The Prime Minister further said that the new government must first overcome various difficulties not caused by them. "After the last World War, we failed to consolidate what we gained in the war and failed to establish a foundation to ensure a peaceful future. Today, everything is clear." (July 7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia – The situation in Romania seems to be rapidly moving towards the rejection of British interests, the most important of which is Romania's oil production. Its exports were stopped several weeks ago, but Germany still fully receives its monthly quota of 130,000 tons, aided by extra railway lines (currently being requisitioned by the Romanian authorities). The amount exported to Germany appears to be continuing to increase. Forty-five British male and female expatriates left Bucharest yesterday, 22 of whom were asked to leave immediately by the Romanian authorities, and the rest voluntarily left due to the unbearable situation. Since announcing its pro-Axis policy, the Romanian government seems to be proceeding at a pace exceeding Germany's expectations. German individuals in Romania are dissatisfied with the Gigurtu government because Gigurtu's thorough Nazi policy towards the Soviet Union is considered too intense. The Soviet Union remains an unpredictable factor in the Romanian situation, and this matter has not lost any of its explosive nature in recent days. At the same time, several Romanian newspapers have gradually shown hostility towards Britain. (July 7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Official Declares Romanian Army Sabotaged Transportation</h3>
<p>Moscow – A representative of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Transportation told a TASS reporter that Romanian troops took away and destroyed telephone equipment, etc., during their retreat. For example, the radio station in Khotyn was also destroyed. However, telephone and telegraph communications in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina have now been restored. Furthermore, before retreating, the Romanian army attempted to sabotage industrial and transportation enterprises, but local executive committees have adjusted food supplies and restored the activities of various shops and factories. At the same time, trams have also resumed operation. Moreover, the executive committee has allocated funds to open hospitals, where people can receive free medical treatment. Newspapers are being published and Soviet films are being screened. (July 7th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bucharest – An official here announced last night that an accident occurred regarding the evacuation of residents from Bessarabia and Bukovina when Jews and Communists were being sent to Bessarabia.

<h3>Sino-German Cultural Association Holds Annual Meeting; Zhu Jiahua Delivers Opening Address</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence – The Sino-German Cultural Association held its fifth annual meeting on the evening of the 7th at the Jialing Guesthouse. Attendees included Honorary Chairman Chen Lifu, represented by Gu Yuxiu, representatives from the Ministry of Social Affairs, Ren Xiping and Meng Jianmin, representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Zhu Shiming, representative from the German Embassy, Lu Yawen, and more than 130 Chinese and German members. First, Association President Zhu Jiahua delivered the opening address, followed by speeches from Gu Yuxiu and Meng Jianmin. Subsequently, Jiang Fuli reported on association affairs, and the association's articles of association were amended and a declaration was passed. Finally, Lu Yawen and Shen Ke, a representative from the German News Agency, gave speeches. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM. The following is a summary of Zhu Jiahua's opening address:</p>
<p>Opening Address</p>
<p>The Sino-German Cultural Association has a history of five years. During these five years, the world has been shrouded in the clouds of war, and East and West have been engulfed in flames. In such an environment, we are still able to promote cultural work, which is truly gratifying. And our holding of the fifth annual meeting of the Sino-German Cultural Association today is particularly special and significant. The whole world is living in war, which is a misfortune for mankind, and even more so for the cultural world. China has been fighting independently for three years to safeguard national independence and ethnic survival. China's national policy is unwavering, and the belief of the Chinese people is as firm as steel. Now, unfortunately, the European war is intensifying rapidly, and the damage suffered by human civilization is enormous and unimaginable. All those engaged in cultural work around the world are saddened and regretful. The spread and prolongation of the European war may result in mutual destruction, or even the destruction of human culture. The German people are particularly endowed with talent and intelligence, and their contribution to culture is admired by everyone. We hope that the German people can make greater contributions to human culture and make enormous efforts to lay the foundation for world peace. Since the seventeenth century, contact has gradually increased, and the relationship has become closer, especially in culture. The communication and promotion of culture between the two countries are closely related to the establishment of world peace. We deeply hope that people from China and Germany will shoulder the common mission and wish for success.</p>
<p>Declaration</p>
<p>Zhu then read a brief declaration, stating: The mission of the Sino-German Cultural Association is to connect the cultures of China and Germany, to promote and enhance them, and to promote the friendship between the two countries, so that it becomes more cordial. In recent years, the evolution of the international situation has affected the Far East. However, this has not hindered the promotion of cultural work between China and Germany in the slightest. We deeply hope that Germany can weigh the importance of matters in the Far East in a timely manner, determine what to adopt and what to discard, and especially hope that Sino-German relations will usher in a new era. We are willing to make sincere efforts to that end.</p>

<h3>Military Spokesman Discusses One Week of War Situation, June 29th to July 6th</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Military Commission issued a statement from a military spokesman regarding the war situation on various fronts, which has become increasingly fierce over the past week (June 29th to July 6th). The progress of operations is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong and Guangxi</p>
<p>In Guangdong Province, Japanese troops landed in the Bao'an area over the weekend and advanced towards Shenzhen Shatoujiao and other places. After the Chinese army resisted step by step, they cut the Japanese army into several sections and annihilated them separately in Shatoujiao, Wangtianhu, Henggang, Longgang, Pingsu, and other places. The remaining Japanese troops fled towards Nantou, and the Chinese army is currently pursuing them. In southern Guangxi, the Japanese army began to invade west from Nanning last week, once invading Ningming, and later further invading Longling and the vicinity of Zhennanguan. According to the original plan of the Chinese army, the Japanese army was lured to favorable areas for repeated and painful annihilation. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Henan and Shanxi</p>
<p>In eastern Henan, the Chinese army has launched fierce attacks on various Japanese strongholds this week. On the morning of the 30th, they captured the northwest city wall of Kaifeng in one fell swoop and engaged in extremely fierce street battles with the Japanese. A small number of remaining Japanese troops retreated to the south of the city. Japanese reinforcements drove in to assist from Xinxiang, but were resisted at Caiyuan Station, resulting in heavy losses for the Japanese. At the same time, the Chinese army attacking Nanguan engaged in fierce street battles with the Japanese, killing more than 4,700 Japanese troops, destroying one Japanese armored train and dozens of cars. Another unit of the Chinese army captured Shangqiu at midnight on the 29th, and then captured Luyi Zhuxianzhen Mamuji and other places on the 30th, and took advantage of the victory to rush into the city of Hao County. On the afternoon of the 2nd, they recaptured Zhecheng, killing countless Japanese troops. The Chinese army is currently expanding its gains in victory.</p>
<p>Western Shanxi</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in the Liulin area have launched fierce attacks on Qikou Xingmen and other places this week. After being severely attacked by the Chinese army, the fighting was extremely fierce. Another unit of the Chinese army entered the area between Sanjiao and Lishi, cutting off the retreat of the Japanese army, attacking from both sides, and annihilating a large number of Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Hubei and Hunan</p>
<p>The Japanese troops trapped in western Xiangyang Jingguan Dangyang have been fiercely attacked and surrounded by the Chinese army this week, suffering extremely heavy casualties. More than a thousand Japanese troops have been killed in Xiaoyandunji, Jingdang. The Japanese troops in Yichang repeatedly attempted to cross the Yangtze River south bank, but were severely attacked by the Chinese army. After bloody battles for four days and four nights, the Japanese repeatedly reinforced, but were eventually completely wiped out by the Chinese army. A small number of surviving Japanese troops, who failed to escape, are hiding in the mountains, and the Chinese army is stepping up its mopping-up operations. At the same time, the Chinese army in eastern Xiangyang surrounded and attacked Yangzi Zhongxiang, recovering many strongholds outside Sui County, such as Leigudun. The Japanese were extremely panicked. Japanese warships on the Dongting Lake in northern Hunan have been harassing Lujiwan Muhupu Junshan and other places in recent days, but have been repeatedly bombarded by the Chinese army, suffering heavy damage. Between the 1st and 2nd, a total of two Japanese warships and five Japanese boats were sunk, and many more were injured. In addition, a certain unit of the Chinese army on land took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese army outside Yueyang, killing a large number of Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Jiangxi and Anhui</p>
<p>The fighting in the suburbs of Nanchang, Jiangxi Province, is still actively underway. After the Chinese army recovered the area around Xishan Wanshou Palace, the Japanese army repeatedly reinforced and counterattacked from Nanchang, but were all defeated. Taking advantage of the victory, they recovered strongholds such as Baijiashan and Yanjialing, and approached Niuhang Station. In this battle, about a thousand Japanese officers and soldiers, including the Japanese battalion commander, were killed, and a large amount of supplies were captured. In addition, the Chinese army attacking Wuning continued to capture strongholds such as Chengnan Nandong Youtou Mountain, and is currently launching an attack on the city. The Japanese army in Shouxian, northern Anhui, has been invading towards the Chinese army along the Shouliu Highway in recent days, but has been met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked Su County, and the Japanese Jinpu Railway traffic has been cut off by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>In addition, (1) Several thousand Japanese troops in Changzhou, Jurong, Jintan, Xishui, Yixing, and other places in southern Jiangsu have been invading Liyang in separate routes in recent days. After the Chinese army resisted in separate routes, a great battle lasted for four days, killing more than a thousand Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese troops fled in defeat. (2) The Chinese army advancing towards Daming in southern Hebei engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army in Yangqiao. Then, the Japanese army reinforced from Qingfeng Nanle. The bloody battle is still ongoing. The Chinese army in Jiaodong has been severely attacking the Japanese army in recent days, and the gains have been great. (3) In the battle south of Gaoyou in northern Jiangsu, more than three hundred Japanese troops, including the commander, were killed, and more than a hundred rifles were captured.

All of the above are important war achievements this week and are specially reported here. (July 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Blockade Plan for Vietnam Not a Fatal Blow to China</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – Today, well-informed sources stated that Japan's forcing France to stop transporting all arms, gasoline trucks, and other military materials through Vietnam is a significant blow to China's arms purchases, but not effective. China's arms imports do not rely entirely on Vietnam. The land route from Lanzhou, Gansu, to the Soviet Union is still open. As for the Yunnan-Burma Road, it depends on Britain's attitude. Moreover, China is now able to manufacture all light weapons, such as machine guns, rifles, field guns, and hand grenades. The only thing that is causing trouble for government transportation companies is the large amount of trucks, auto parts, machinery, railway sleepers, and large quantities of gasoline stored in Haiphong, which must be transported to Yunnan via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway or to Guangxi via the Longzhou Highway. Vietnamese authorities have banned the transport of these goods since June 17th. However, all trucks, auto parts, and gasoline shipped from the United States arrived in Haiphong in early June. The United States may send representatives to negotiate with France and Japan regarding the goods detained in Vietnam, as these goods cannot be regarded as war materials and can be shipped via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway according to the Sino-French agreement. These sleepers were originally purchased for the construction of a new railway line from Kunming to Xuzhou (transliteration) in Sichuan (35 miles southwest of Chongqing), costing 480,000,000 French francs, borrowed from France, with the remaining customs revenue and the coal, iron, and copper mines along the new railway line as collateral. These mineral deposits were discovered during the construction of this new line. When this line is completed, Xuzhou will be directly connected to Haiphong, which will be beneficial to both China and Vietnam. It is not yet known to what extent the blockade of Vietnam will affect the construction of this new railway line. However, this road will not be very effective if goods cannot be transported through Vietnam. The blockade of Vietnam also affects Hong Kong, as most of the goods are shipped from the United States to Hong Kong by Pan-Pacific mail ships, and then shipped to Haiphong by ships. The blockade of Vietnam does not harm the Chinese Air Force, as most of China's fighter planes are purchased from Soviet Russia and some can be manufactured domestically. China's field guns are also mostly purchased from the Soviet Union via the Lanzhou Highway. This route avoids Japanese air raids and is most secure. The transport of arms from Europe to China has been greatly reduced since Germany launched its blitzkrieg tactics. (July 7th International News Service Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Brilliant and Great July 7th Anniversary Was Solemnly Observed Yesterday; Special Precautions in the Concessions Prevented Accidents; Citizens' Moods Were Enthusiastic and Beliefs Were Strengthened</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third anniversary of the July 7th Incident. After three years of hard work and trials, the foundation for victory in the war of resistance and national reconstruction has been laid, and the solemn and brilliant new chapter of Chinese history will be opened with the start of the fourth year. Although the city's environment has worsened due to the impact of the European war, and no commemorative ceremonies were held, the general public was in high spirits. In addition to some enthusiastic individuals who voluntarily stopped entertainment and banquets to silently pay tribute to the generously martyred soldiers and civilians, or further donated money, people from all walks of life worked and carried out their activities in their respective positions, as usual, and their faces were full of optimism and determination. In the past year, world affairs have been like clouds, and the international community has been turbulent. Some independent countries have been enslaved, and some have suffered complete devastation. Even those great powers that have always been known for their wealth and strength have experienced rapid rise and fall, making people feel the vicissitudes of life. All of this is a great mirror, which is enough to reflect China's strong and unyielding spirit. Amidst the ever-changing world affairs, it stands proudly, like a giant. The Chinese nation's self-confidence has also been increased a hundredfold. Yesterday morning, after Chairman Chiang's various documents were published in various newspapers, his imposing spirit, piercing the sun and moon, and his resounding voice, like gold and stone, were enough to demonstrate that the final victory would surely belong to us. In addition to vigilance, the citizens were cheered and inspired. The following is a record of the activities of various parties yesterday:</p>
<p>Unprecedented Precautions; Strict Patrols</p>
<p>In view of the recent complex situation in the two concessions, the police authorities implemented unprecedented special precautions yesterday. All police personnel and special patrolmen were dispatched, distributed at various road intersections, and patrolled in batches. The red alert troops of the Public Concession and the armored vehicles of the French Concession patrolled everywhere all day yesterday to inspect the defense situation. British, American, French, and Scottish troops were also ordered to be dispatched yesterday, fully armed with live ammunition. In addition to posting guards at key traffic routes, they also patrolled in their respective defense areas in groups of three to five. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps and the French Volunteer Corps were also fully mobilized to assist the concession police in maintaining order. All fortresses in the city were also fully garrisoned with British and French troops, and the atmosphere was quite tense. However, due to the strict precautions, it was able to pass safely and no incident occurred that could cause disturbance. These special precautions were lifted at 6:00 PM last night.</p>
<p>Remote Paths and Alleys Were All Blocked</p>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions sent personnel to seal off all the non-main roads in the city with barbed wire the night before. The work was completed overnight. Yesterday, on both sides of Avenue Edward VII, from east to west, except for the Bund, Henan Road, Fujian Road, Dongxin Bridge, Yu Qiaqing Road, Maho Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, Shanlian Road, and other places, leaving a gap for vehicles and pedestrians to enter and exit, the remaining twenty or so roads were all blocked. The lanes and remote paths in the two concessions were also blocked at the same time. At each road where only a gap was left, five or six Chinese and foreign detectives were stationed on both sides to strictly check pedestrians and vehicles. Under the traffic lights at the center of the Great World, there was also a truck with dozens of British soldiers armed and stationed yesterday morning, with especially strict precautions. But they were withdrawn at noon. The situation on the Bund was also quite tense. Pedestrians and vehicles were checked one by one, and concession police and foreign defense forces were stationed at each pier, checking those who landed quite strictly. However, because people generally feared accidents, the number of ferries traveling in the Huangpu River was greatly reduced, presenting a rather lonely scene.</p>
<p>Traffic on Various Bridges Was Strictly Restricted</p>
<p>In order to take strict precautions, the Public Concession sealed off both ends of the Jiangxi Road Bridge and the Shanxi Road Bridge with barbed wire and sent police to guard them, prohibiting pedestrians and vehicles from passing through. Other bridges, such as the Tianhou Palace Bridge, Fujian Road Bridge, and Zhejiang Road Bridge, were open as usual, but barbed wire was placed at the ends of the bridges, and many Chinese and foreign detectives were stationed to guard them closely and conducted searches from time to time. Although the Wuzhen Road Bridge, Xin Zha Road Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, Inner Bailey Bridge, and Outer Bailey Bridge, which lead to Zhabei, were open as usual, the number of British and Japanese troops and detectives stationed there was increased compared to normal, and the situation was also very tense.</p>
<p>Iron Gates on Concession Roads Were All Closed</p>
<p>As for the various intersections of District A on the north bank of Suzhou Creek leading to Hongkou, since the Japanese army expanded to the western section of North Henan Road and set up posts and stationed troops, there have been no restrictions on residents entering and exiting there. All the iron gates on the various roads leading to the concession road were closed uniformly from yesterday morning. Tram route 18, which originally turned from North Xizang Road into Kaifeng Road and Haining Road to the end of North Henan Road, changed its route yesterday, turning from Beijing Road into Henan Road. Tram routes 5 and 17, which originally had the North Railway Station as their terminus, stopped at Haining Road yesterday due to the closure of the iron gates.</p>
<p>The Scene in Hongkou and Zhabei Was Desolate</p>
<p>In Hongkou and Yangshupu, the Japanese army's precautions were also very strict. Armed patrols patrolled the streets in groups of two. In the vicinity of the Wusong Wharf on Yangshupu Road, the garrison of the Nichiga troops was particularly forbidden for Chinese people to approach. In front of the Japanese shops, most of them had the Japanese flag displayed. The unarmed puppet police in Zhabei were also on guard at key intersections yesterday. However, because the general public was in a special environment, few went out, so the situation seemed even more desolate.</p>
<p>The Yuyuan Road Intersection Was Tense for a Time</p>
<p>At 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, a puppet policeman shouldered a rifle and crossed into the intersection of Haig Road and Yuyuan Road, on the road in front of No. 28 Xinyuantai Fruit Shop, when it was noticed by the British defense forces stationed at the Yuyuan Road intersection. The British defense forces advised the puppet police to leave, but the puppet police ignored them and acted arrogantly, and even clashed with the British defense forces and made shooting gestures. The situation was very tense for a time. The Jing'an Temple Road Police Station was nearby and, upon hearing the news, immediately sent Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to maintain order, and sent three armored vehicles to guard the area. The two sides confronted each other for about half an hour. The puppet police left sullenly after a senior officer from the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station came forward to explain.</p>
<p>Mutual Competition for Tax Cards</p>
<p>From 4:30 AM to 5:00 AM on the 5th of this month, and at dawn the day before yesterday (the 6th), dense machine gun fire and chaotic rifle fire were heard from western Shanghai, mixed with small cannon fire, which was loud and clear. The residents of the French Concession were puzzled and could not understand what was happening. In addition, the area outside the concession was occupied, so the truth could not be ascertained. According to information obtained from Pingming News Agency from a person from Longhua, it was actually a fire that broke out due to the "Peace Salvation Army" and the Japanese army competing for "tax cards." Zhang Huifang and the Japanese army clashed. Zhang's troops could not withstand the attack and withdrew. It is reported that both sides suffered heavy casualties this time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Commander Nishio Visits Shanghai: Yesterday at the International Hotel with an Entourage, Heavy Security Deployed on Jing'an Temple Road</h3>
<p>Nishio Shuzo, the commander-in-chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force, having just arrived in Shanghai from Jiangning the day before, yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, led over ten of his senior military officers, traveling in Nanjing Automobile Registration No. 1, Shanghai Defense Army Registration Nos. "452," "292," "303," "264," "209," and over a dozen other motorcycles, to Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>They dined at the International Hotel. After Nishio and his entourage arrived, they proceeded to the 14th floor, dined with their staff, and inspected the facilities. They also displayed maps, with Nishio's staff pointing out and explaining features, gazing out the windows at the scenery. The New Gate Police Station had been notified in advance and deployed a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives inside and outside the International Hotel to maintain security.</p>
<p>Several dozen American defense troops were also posted outside. Nishio and his party stayed for about an hour and a half, departing at 10:15 AM. They boarded their respective cars. The area around the International Hotel was temporarily closed to vehicles and pedestrians until Nishio and his entourage left. They were then escorted along Jing'an Temple Road westward towards Yidingpan Road, west of the American defense zone, towards Fanhuangdu, under heavy guard with two American military trucks No. "176" and "222" loaded with armed American defense troops, one in front and one behind the Japanese officers' cars. When Nishio's cars left the concession and arrived at</p>
<p>the roads beyond the concession on Jessfield Road and Fanhuangdu, large numbers of Japanese troops had been deployed there, with one Japanese soldier stationed every sixty steps on both sides, facing the pedestrian walkway in a standing guard. These troops were withdrawn at 10:45 AM after Nishio's cars had passed.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Under Military Control</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third anniversary of the War of Resistance and National Construction. The two concessions implemented unprecedented security measures. Troops from various countries, police detectives, and the International Volunteer Corps were all mobilized, placing the entire concession under military control. Fortunately, the day passed peacefully without incident.

<h3>Japanese Military Police Arrested for Unauthorized Entry into American Defense Zone: Sixteen Disarmed, Released After Explanation of Misunderstanding</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," today (the 7th) is the third anniversary of the Lugouqiao Incident. This morning, sixteen plainclothes armed Japanese military police entered the American Marine Corps defense zone without permission, leading to</p>
<p>their arrest by American soldiers.</p>
<p>They were taken to the American Marine Corps headquarters. American military authorities lodged a strong protest with the Japanese military, demanding a written apology from the Japanese side. The fact that armed Japanese personnel entered the American defense zone in plainclothes today violates the long-standing agreement between the commanders of the various countries' garrison forces in the Public Concession. However, the Japanese Embassy this morning</p>
<p>broadcasted a statement</p>
<p>strongly refuting this, claiming that the Japanese military police were merely taking "routine measures" to protect General Nishio Shuzo, who was attending a banquet at the International Hotel this morning, and "negligently" failed to consider the agreement. This morning, most of the plainclothes Japanese military police were arrested by American soldiers in the Jing'an Temple Road area. They were</p>
<p>loitering</p>
<p>with bulges at their waists and hips, attracting the attention of American soldiers. Four plainclothes Japanese military police in a truck at the Jing'an Temple Road intersection were also arrested, taken into American Marine Corps patrol cars and driven away. It is reported that the arrested Japanese did not resist.</p>
<p>This newspaper learned last night that the sixteen arrested plainclothes Japanese military police were released to the Japanese side at the Waibaidu Bridge at around 5:00 PM after the misunderstanding was explained.</p>
<h3>Rice Price Evaluation: First Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Price Evaluation Committee officially began its work today and stipulated that, in addition to dispatching personnel weekly to investigate warehouse stocks for evaluation purposes, it would hold meetings twice a week. The evaluation would take place on the 2nd and 5th days, and the announcement would be made on the 3rd and 6th days. The committee's first evaluation meeting is scheduled for 3:00 PM tomorrow at the meeting place at No. 15 Avenue Edward VII. At that time, it will assess the highest prices based on the actual situation of rice arrivals, sales, and production costs, but for the time being, only foreign rice will be considered.</p>
<h3>Jiangpu Bureau Announces Truth About River Dredging</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Jiangpu Bureau has issued a solemn denial regarding the claim that large-scale dredging of the Huangpu River has begun. It has also stated that the high tides in July have already been measured and attention has been directed to them. The following is a record from the Datong News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Dredging Vessels</p>
<p>The bureau solemnly denies the rumor that its dredging vessel "Jianshe" has been repaired and completed, that the "Fuxing" has set sail from Germany for Shanghai, and that large-scale dredging of the Huangpu River will begin in July. As far as the bureau knows, the "Jianshe" is still moored in the heart of the river off the French Concession Bund for repairs and has not moved an inch. Although the "Fuxing" was completed in Germany some time ago, it has not been able to set sail for Shanghai due to domestic war issues and now due to the European war. Therefore, the dissemination of the above news is highly strange.</p>
<p>Dredging Scale</p>
<p>Regarding the dredging of the Huangpu River, the bureau is currently dredging the two sections below Chenjiazhui and Lujiazui. The dredging of the section below Lujiazui has already been completed, but the projects are all very small, far less than one-tenth of what they were before the war. This is because the bureau currently only has a few dredging vessels available, such as "Hai Xiang" and "Hai Bao," not the full fleet of dredging vessels that could be deployed before the war. Therefore, the rumor that large-scale dredging would begin in July is not accurate.</p>
<p>High Tide Quantities</p>
<p>The bureau's Water Conservancy Department has already measured the quantity of high tides during the flood season in July. The records are as follows: July 7, 11 feet 4 inches; July 8, 11 feet 2.5 inches; July 9, 11 feet 0.5 inches; July 10, 10 feet 8 inches; July 11 to 17, tides stable; July 18, trending high from midnight, 10 feet 9.5 inches; July 20, 11 feet 6.3 inches; July 21, 11 feet 5.2 inches; July 22, 11 feet 2.5 inches; July 23, 10 feet 7 inches.</p>
<h3>Difficulties Encountered in Exporting Shanghai Goods: Southern Sales Hindered by Transportation, Northern Shipments Restricted</h3>
<p>Goods and textiles from various national product factories in this port, destined for Guangdong, Guangxi, Sichuan, Yunnan and other places, used to transit through Hong Kong and then through Mazhang, or via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. Since the transportation on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has become difficult, and recently Hong Kong has been experiencing difficulties in freight transport due to the tense situation between Britain and Japan, the export trade of various national product manufacturers in this city has gradually decreased. This is because Mazhang is adjacent to Longshan, where the Japanese army has been quite active recently, and there have been actions of aggression in that area. Various merchants and factories are unwilling to risk such a great danger. Therefore, the goods shipped from this port to the above-mentioned places in recent times have mostly changed routes, but transportation is quite difficult. Because there is no construction of highways and railways, transportation relies entirely on waterways, and the dates will inevitably be delayed. Therefore, the Shanghai goods in various inland areas cannot meet the demand, especially textiles, while this port has ample stocks and cannot export them. As for North China, since the implementation of controlled import trade to reduce the pressure on "Lianhe Bank Notes," goods imported into North China from third countries and Central and Southern China, with the exception of food, must have a "Letter of Approval" from the "Preparation Bank" or a "Permit" from the "Customs Supervisor." Therefore, this port's exports to North China, except for rice and flour, will be greatly affected in the future. The main commodities most affected are cigarettes, textiles, silk, tea, and cosmetics.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquettes Already Falling in Price and Being Sold Off: Reduced Costs, Sluggish Sales</h3>
<p>The selling price of coal briquettes from various factories was previously set by the industry association to agree on standard market prices. Regardless of factory wholesale or retail, transactions must not exceed the limit. For a time, each factory still complied with the retail price of eight yuan per dan. Yesterday, a certain factory lowered the price of its inventory, stating that the manufacturing cost seemed to have been reduced. For a time, the market saw a sudden drop in prices. Although the factory wholesale price was still shouted at 148 yuan, the actual price had opened at 140 yuan. Therefore, the selling prices at various retail stores also varied quite a bit, calculated at 7 yuan 6 jiao, 7 yuan 4 jiao, 7 yuan 2-3 jiao, etc. It has been learned that there is no increase in the amount of spot goods on the market now. In addition, due to the approaching of muggy heat, sales of coal briquettes from various coal briquette factories have been sluggish, so they have reduced production. In short, the current manufacturing cost of coal briquettes has clearly been reduced, so it seems that reducing the selling price cannot be delayed.</p>
<h3>Tuberculosis Prevention Association June Donations</h3>
<p>From June 1st to 30th, the Shanghai Tuberculosis Prevention Association received a total of 8,971 yuan and 9 jiao 2 fen in donations from various parties. In addition, it also received various kinds of donated goods from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>French Embassy Military Attaché Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Yi Feng, the military attaché of the French Embassy in China, has returned to Shanghai from South China.</p>
<h3>After Hong Kong-Vietnam Transportation is Suppressed: The Importance of the Burma Road is Becoming the Only International Transportation Line in South China, the Japanese Side Pays Special Attention to News from Burma, and the British Authorities in Hong Kong are Massively Stockpiling Grain</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Burma are the only international transportation lines for China after the war. All exports of local products and imports of necessities are important places for entry and exit from all three places, especially Hong Kong. Although Japan has requested Britain and France to attempt a blockade, except for the temporary suspension of freight transport in Vietnam, Hong Kong and Burma are still unobstructed. However, Burma in the future will become the only international transportation line in southern China, because the Burma Road has been completed and the Burma Railway is about to open. Hong Kong is surrounded by Japan and its trade with China will inevitably be affected.</p>
<p>Trade Overview</p>
<p>It is reported that the Chinese government will change the controlled export of bristles, tung oil, tea, and minerals to be transported from Burma to Europe and the United States via the Burma Road. The following is a record of trade between Hong Kong, Vietnam, and Burma with China from January to May this year: Hong Kong imported 31,386,000 yuan, exported 177,543,000 yuan; Vietnam imported 64,378,000 yuan, exported 26,700,000 yuan; Burma imported 5,270,000 yuan, exported 8,282,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Recent Situation in Hong Kong Defense</p>
<p>Freight transportation between Shanghai and Haiphong has always been very prosperous. Since the French authorities in Vietnam accepted the Japanese request to ban the transport of military supplies into China on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and sent personnel to monitor within Vietnam, the situation in Haiphong has recently been of great concern to all parties. According to a Píngmíng Shè reporter who recently met with a reliable Mr. Laike who came to Shanghai via Hong Kong from Haiphong to inquire about the recent situation, it was said that he came to Shanghai from Haiphong on the first of this month. At that time, all Chinese</p>
<p>freight transportation businesses had already been completely shut down, and all Chinese transportation agencies set up in various places such as Haiphong and Hanoi in Vietnam had also withdrawn. Although many of the goods accumulated in them came from the United States, the responsibility still rested with the U.S. side until they were transported to China. Therefore, this measure by the Vietnamese French authorities not only violates the Sino-French agreement, but also deliberately disregards the rights and interests of third countries. Moreover, the "inspectors" sent by the Japanese side are mostly Japanese naval and army personnel, and it is clearly visible that they have military characteristics. Then, how Vietnam will evolve in the future is extremely disturbing. This not only threatens the southwestern provinces of China, but also has a serious impact on the position of Britain and the United States in</p>
<p>the Far East due to the actions between France and Japan. He had personally witnessed French personnel and Japanese personnel riding motorcycles together and parading through the streets, speeding back and forth. Looking at their actions, they even exceeded the "agreement" known to the world. In addition to monitoring freight transport, Chinese passing through Vietnam were subjected to unprecedented strict searches. All documents, books, and even private letters were often confiscated for no reason. Because the Vietnamese French authorities treated the Chinese so disregardfully, the general trend was for the Chinese to leave Vietnam in increasing numbers. When I took the steamer to Hong Kong, I was again</p>
<p>stopped by Japanese warships from berthing, and Japanese sailors searched the ship. As for the situation in Hong Kong, it is still extremely tense. The work of evacuating women and children is extremely active. However, most of the Chinese took steamers to Shanghai, so the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai was extremely crowded. However, one thing that can comfort the people of Shanghai is that the British authorities in Hong Kong have indeed prepared to resist the aggressors, and the strength of Hong Kong is also very sufficient. Although food has always had to be obtained from outside ports, it is now reported that there are large stockpiles, enough to meet the needs of a very long period in an emergency.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Attaches Importance</p>
<p>The Zìlín Xībào reported from Tokyo on July 6th, that Japanese radio stations are broadcasting news about the South Pacific Islands and South China to the whole country every day, which proves that Japan is paying close attention to these two places. Last night, Japanese sources claimed that the British war supplies and supplies transported to Chongqing via Hong Kong and Burma have doubled in the past, and newspapers are now publishing articles in prominent positions about the economic resources and political status of Burma and Vietnam, as well as the characteristics of the local people.</p>

<h3>Details of the Entrapment of Ma Yuanfang and Others</h3>
<p>Dàguāng Shè reports that on the evening of the 23rd of last month at 9:00 PM, Mǎ Yuánfàng, the Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Party Department, Committee Member Cuī Bùwǔ, Provincial Government Secretary Shí Shùnyuān, and Councilor Zhǎng Mùmín, were lured to Room 420 of the Far Eastern Hotel on Yú Qiàqīng Road by Chén Běishēng, a former committee member of the Provincial Party Department who had already been dismissed. Chén then informed the Japanese military police to go there. Mǎ Yuánfàng and the others were taken to the police station, and the next morning, they were taken to Hongkou and then to Western Shanghai. This arrest of Mǎ and the others was entirely planned by Chén, so after Chén arrived at the police station, he was released.</p>
<h3>Traffickers in Human Flesh Who Separated Families: Special Court No. 2 Concludes Trial</h3>
<p>In April of this year, the Jiaru Road Police Station cracked a large-scale human trafficking organization, and ten male and female traffickers were all arrested. It was found that from last spring until the date of their arrest, they had trafficked about 150 boys between the ages of four and eight, all of whom were sold to Sū Déshān at No. 29 Shuixian Road, Xiamen, for about 100 yuan per child. After questioning by Special Court No. 1, Líng Róngsēn, Líng Zhāngshì, Wáng Lǐshì, Wáng Wúshì, and Zhūgě Qiánshì were sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment for colluding and continuously intending to make a profit by luring boys under the age of sixteen away from their families, and were each fined 1,500 yuan. Cuī Téngshì was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment, Lù Wénzhōng and Zhūgě Chūn were each sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment, and were each fined 800 yuan. Wáng Zhāngshì was found not guilty. The defendants shall also be jointly and severally responsible for returning the victims to the various complainants. Because the police stations found that the various criminals had committed no less than a hundred cases in the territory, they immediately sent detective Yán Jīnwén to transfer the various defendants and send them to Criminal Court No. 1 of Special Court No. 2 to be prosecuted according to law. This case was tried by Judge Sūn Péngxián. Because it was necessary to wait for the various complainants to appear in court for questioning, the discussion was postponed. A continuation was held yesterday morning. Because the details of the case were already clear, the debate was ordered to be opened, and the sentence was scheduled to be pronounced on the 12th.

Since the news of the conflict between the British and French fleets in Oran, Africa, was transmitted here, the British and French authorities here have been silent on current affairs and have not made any comments. Moreover, due to the strict neutrality of the concession, the embassies of various countries have notified overseas Chinese to remain calm. It was rumored that U.S. Ambassador Dr. Johnson would come to Shanghai in the short term. It has now been learned that Ambassador Johnson has canceled his trip to Shanghai, which was scheduled to depart on the 4th of this month, in order to deal with the problem of overseas Chinese because Chongqing had been subjected to multiple air raids.

Director Xu stated that the Lishui District Enrollment Committee held its first meeting last month and immediately decided on internal personnel responsibilities. In accordance with regulations, examiners for each subject were hired to set questions and grade papers. However, due to transportation difficulties, all registration forms and documents were only officially issued to Zhejiang on the 20th of last month. Currently, the organizers are quickly reprinting them. Examinees can directly go to the registration office of the Lishui Zhejiang Provincial Yingshi University to obtain and fill out the forms, and register at the office from July 14th to the 16th, the designated registration period. Students from afar may use the mail-in registration method but must use express mail or other swift methods to ensure delivery to the office within the registration period. Late submissions will not be accepted. The examination period is scheduled from July 20th to the 24th. The examination questions for each subject are uniformly formulated by the Ministry of Education, which has sent personnel to collect them from a certain location. They will arrive in Zhejiang soon. The examination locations will be determined temporarily based on the number of students and transportation conditions and will be announced at the entrance of Yingshi University by the registration deadline. In addition, a Tunxi enrollment sub-office has been established in this district, designated by the Ministry of Education to be handled by personnel from the Zhejiang University Southeast Branch. It is heard that the school has consulted with the Anhui Southern Administrative Office to assist in designating registration and examination locations.

<h3>Ministry of Education Rewards Vocational School Teachers for Advanced Studies; 20 Scholarships Set Up Annually; Yunnan Ordered to Comply After Receiving Instructions</h3>
<p>(Kunming Correspondence) In order to encourage the advanced studies of teachers in vocational schools, the Ministry of Education has, since the 25th academic year, utilized summer vacations to convene principals, directors, and teachers of agricultural and industrial vocational schools in stages to hold lectures and discussions to impart new knowledge. However, the number of participants varied, and the levels were also disparate. In addition, the short duration made in-depth research and discussion insufficient. The advanced studies of teachers in each subject area are of great importance to improving teaching practice in their respective fields and should not be overlooked. The "Provisional Measures for Rewarding the Advanced Studies of Vocational Subject Teachers in Vocational Schools" has now been formulated, stipulating that it will first be implemented in agricultural and industrial vocational schools this year. The Ministry has specially issued the measures and ordered compliance. After receiving the order, the Yunnan Provincial Education Department immediately reprinted the measures and distributed them to all agricultural and industrial vocational schools to be followed. The details of these measures are as follows: 1. In order to encourage the advanced studies of vocational subject teachers in vocational schools, the Ministry has established scholarships for advanced studies, with a quota of 20 annually. 2. Scholarships for advanced studies are divided into two types, A and B, with 10 of each type. Type A is 80 yuan per month, and Type B is 60 yuan per month. 3. Teachers who request scholarships for advanced studies must possess one of the following qualifications: (A) Graduates of domestic or foreign specialized schools or above who have continuously served as full-time teachers of vocational subjects in public, private, or registered private senior vocational schools for more than three years and have achieved outstanding results may request Type A scholarships for advanced studies. (B) Graduates of domestic or foreign specialized schools or above who have continuously served as full-time teachers of vocational subjects in public or registered private junior vocational schools for more than three years and have achieved outstanding results may request Type B scholarships for advanced studies. 4. Teachers who request scholarships for advanced studies must have the principal of their current school complete the advanced studies scholarship form stipulated by the Ministry in May of each year and submit it to the competent education department for review and transfer to the Ministry by June 10th. 5. The review of requests for scholarships for advanced studies will be handled by a committee organized by the Ministry. 6. Teachers who request scholarships for advanced studies, after being approved by the Ministry, will be sent to schools or research institutions designated by the Ministry for advanced studies. The advanced study plan will be drafted by the school or institution and submitted to the Ministry for approval. 7. In addition to supplementing specialized new knowledge related to the teaching of their respective subjects, advanced study methods should focus on experimentation, research, and practical work to improve skills. 8. During the advanced study period, the school, research institution, or business unit will designate personnel to be responsible for guiding the advanced studies. After passing the assessment, the advanced study situation will be reported to the Ministry, and a certificate of achievement will be given. 9. The duration of advanced study is set at six months. In special circumstances, if the advanced study institution deems it necessary, an extension of six months may be requested. 10. Teachers who have completed the advanced study period should return to their original school to serve for at least two years. Those with excellent service performance will be rewarded and protected after verification by the competent education administrative authority. 11. Teachers who receive scholarships for advanced studies from the Ministry may still receive their original salary. However, if they stop advanced studies or do not return to their original school to serve without reason, they should be required to return the full amount of the scholarship received.</p>

<h3>Hezhong Cup Basketball Tournament: Qifan Suffers a Crushing Defeat to Liangxi; Qifan Left With Only Three Players Due to Fouls; Liangxi Triumphs With 70 Against 40</h3>
<p>In yesterday's sixth act of the Hezhong Cup Charity Basketball Tournament, in the first match of the Class A Industrial Group, the main players of Zhongyi, Hu Guocheng and his brother Guoding, were not seen on the court, greatly weakening their strength. However, they showed great enthusiasm at first and shot accurately. Tongren worked hard to follow, with Zhongyi leading by five points, 19 to 14, in the first half. After the change of ends, Tongren's Xuan Tongxuan and Jiang Shuliang cooperated closely and tacitly, increasing their scores and catching up later. As a result, Zhongyi fell behind 31 to 39, and Tongren reversed the defeat into victory.</p>
<p>Qifan Loses to Liangxi</p>
<p>The next game was between Qifan and Liangxi of the Class A First Group. Qifan's main players, Xu Jusheng, Kong Guangyi, Dong Yangfeng, and Wang Xingen, were absent yesterday due to various reasons, greatly reducing their strength. However, with the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, they fought against the odds, and their morale was extremely high. They made frequent contributions. In the first ten minutes, Qifan's performance was quite remarkable. Qian Jingyong and Zhang Xianlun repeatedly broke through Liangxi's basket and led for a long time. Later, Liangxi's Liang Yunming scored three pointers, and Zhang Liangxiong and Zhuo Guoxiong frequently made free throws. When the first half ended, Liangxi took the lead with 35 to 23. In the second half, Liangxi's Zhang Liangxiong suddenly became enthusiastic, and the score increased sharply. Qifan's Qu Xilin was closely watched by Liangxi and could not move. Before long, Zhang Xianlun was fouled out for the fourth time and replaced by Jin Changchun, who scored two goals. However, when it was 32 to 48, Qu Xilin was also fouled out. Due to the lack of fresh troops, there was no substitute. They fought with only four people. When it was 40 to 55, Qu Xilong was also fouled out. Only three players were left on Qifan's front line, and the disparity in numbers was too great. Therefore, in the last four minutes, Liangxi entered the no-man's land and won with 70 to 40.</p>

<p>Chinese Secret Book Stolen by Japanese Spies</p>
<p>According to the article "Southwest Development and Newly Emerging Industries" published recently in the "Mantetsu Survey Monthly" by the South Manchuria Railway Company of Japan, it is said to be a private translation of a secret report from the Chinese government's internal affairs, obtained by Japanese spies. The full text is approximately 20,000 words, divided into two parts. The first part describes various newly emerging industries, and the second part describes the existing industries in various southwestern provinces. The newly emerging industries are further divided into two categories: private and state-owned. Each factory's content has a general report, along with two lists: one for private factories and one for state-owned factories.

<h3>Market Knowledge Consultant</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Daozhang asks:</p>
<p>(1) Your newspaper published in the commercial news column on May 25 that the Central Bank's listed silver tax is 15.00%. Calculated based on the British gold standard of one shilling and two and a half pence, what is the meaning of the silver equalization tax and the levy of 15.00%?</p>
<p>(2) On the same day, the customs gold equivalent to British gold was listed as thirty-nine pence and five, and equivalent to US $0.521875. What formula is used to convert this?</p>
<p>(3) Is the price of British pure gold at eight pounds and eight shillings per ounce fixed and不变?</p>
<p>——Please have the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute answer</p>
<p>(1) The silver equalization tax was originally established because the silver dollar in China had a higher value than legal tender, to prevent Chinese silver dollars from flowing out. The equalization tax rate is calculated based on the British gold standard of one shilling and two and a half pence compared to the previous day's London silver price. If the silver content of each silver dollar is higher than one shilling and two and a half pence, then the excess amount will be taxed, and 15.00% is this tax rate.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the conversion to British gold, it is calculated based on one yuan being equivalent to one shilling and two and a half pence. The Central Bank's listed customs gold is equivalent to 2.707 yuan in legal tender, and the exchange rate of one yuan of legal tender to British currency is fourteen and a half pence. Therefore (2.707 x 14.5 = 39.25), each unit of customs gold is thirty-nine pence and twenty-five. As for the value against the US dollar, it is calculated based on the previous day's New York closing exchange rate, which is $0.521875.</p>
<p>(3) The official exchange rate of the British pound is $4.02 against the US dollar, and the US also has an official gold price of $35 per ounce and is making every effort to purchase domestic and foreign gold to maintain this price. Therefore, the price of London British pure gold at eight pounds and eight shillings per ounce has not changed.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Xiannan asks:</p>
<p>I read the financial weekly, volume 9, issue 18, regarding the equalization tax table on April 23:</p>
<p>British exchange parity 17.3522, Shanghai opening British exchange price 4.125, difference 13.2272, theoretical equalization tax 312.91, equalization tax (percentage) 12.00, difference 300.91</p>
<p>(1) What calculations are the basis for the above three numbers: theoretical equalization tax 312.91, equalization tax 12.00, difference 300.91?</p>
<p>(2) What is the principle behind our country's levying of equalization tax?</p>
<p>(3) Why does the equalization tax for Monday in that issue only have the Shanghai opening British exchange price of 4.1250 and the equalization tax of 9.75, and no other records?</p>
<p>Please have the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute answer</p>
<p>(1) The theoretical equalization tax is calculated based on the black market exchange rate. Due to the decline in the exchange rate, the equalization tax should be 312.91%. However, if calculated with each yuan equal to one shilling and two pence, then only 15.00% is taxed. The difference between the two is 300.91. If the equalization tax is calculated with each yuan equal to one shilling and two and a half pence, then the formula is as follows:</p>
<p>London silver price x 0.8165744 (pure silver content per yuan)</p>
<p>(1) 14.5 (one shilling and two pence) +</p>
<p>(London silver price x 0.8165744)</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the principle of equalization tax, please refer to the answer to Mr. Huang Daozhang's question.</p>
<p>(3) The London silver price market closes every Saturday, so there is no British exchange parity on Sunday.</p>

<p>Mr. Shen Chengzhao asks:</p>
<p>(1) What is import usance? How does the A/P method work?</p>
<p>(2) How are forward foreign exchange rates generated?</p>
<p>Please have the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute answer</p>
<p>(1) Import usance is a business where the bank provides financing to the importer and handles foreign payments on their behalf. There are usually two methods:</p>
<p>1. The bank, at the request of the importer, accepts the bill of exchange issued by the foreign exporter. The method is first for the importer to request a commercial letter of credit (referred to as a "credit letter") from their bank and send it to the exporter. The latter then issues a bill to the issuing bank based on this credit letter. The addressee of the credit letter is the exporter, stating that within the specified amount, the recipient may issue a bill to the issuing bank, which will be accepted or paid by the latter. The exporter then discounts the bill along with various shipping documents such as the shipping bill of lading, insurance policy, and invoice with their bank (this is one of the export usance methods). Then, the exporter's bank sends the bill and documents to the importer's bank for acceptance. After the latter accepts the bill, they return the bill and keep the shipping documents, notifying the importer to prepare funds to collect the shipping documents, or the importer can obtain the documents by issuing a trust receipt to the bank. However, the bill must be paid in full before it matures. After the bill is accepted by the bank, it is repeatedly discounted in the bill market. When the bill matures, the holder can present it to the accepting bank for redemption. The latter can redeem it because they have received the payment from the importer. In this transaction, the exporter has already received cash on the date of shipment, and the importer can pay after the goods arrive or request the bank to extend the payment within the maturity period (such as using a trust receipt). The party responsible for the advance payment is neither the exporter's bank nor the importer's bank. The former can discount the bill in the market after it is accepted when the bill and its documents are sent to the foreign correspondent bank, turning it into a deposit in its correspondent bank. The latter only assumes the responsibility of acceptance and does not actually make an advance payment. The real lender is the investor who purchases the bill. Because our country does not have a bill discount market and the credit of various banks has no international standing, our banks do not issue credit letters.</p>
<p>2. The bank, at the request of the importer, entrusts its foreign correspondent bank to purchase the bill issued by the exporter. Most of our country's import usance uses this method. This method first requires the importer to request a "purchase authorization" (A/P) from their bank. The content is also in the form of a letter, which is sent from the issuing bank to its correspondent bank. After the latter receives the letter, it notifies the exporter to issue a bill (the acceptor and payer of this bill is the importer) and sells it to the bank along with the shipping documents. The bank then makes a payment from the issuing bank's current account and sends the bill and shipping documents to the entrusting bank. After the latter receives the bill and shipping documents, it notifies the importer to prepare funds to take them. This bill cannot be repeatedly discounted because it is not a bank-accepted bill.</p>
<p>(2) Forward foreign exchange, also known as foreign exchange futures, had trading in foreign currency futures in Vienna and Berlin in the 19th century. Later, foreign exchange markets in countries with unstable currencies often had forward contracts. In our country, during the silver standard era, the foreign exchange futures market had already emerged because the exchange rate fluctuated. This is because import and export trade has a high exchange rate risk when the currency is unstable. Importers need to pre-purchase foreign exchange to determine their purchase costs, and exporters need to pre-sell foreign exchange to determine their income. The former is seeking and the latter is supplying, which can be exchanged with each other. There are also foreign exchange speculators who buy and sell short, which constitutes today's foreign exchange futures market.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma Guoliang asks:</p>
<p>What is exchange dumping?</p>
<p>Please have the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute answer</p>
<p>Devaluing the currency or using other methods to lower the foreign exchange rate will inevitably lower the price of domestic exports when calculated in foreign currency, allowing them to be sold cheaply in foreign markets. After Britain abandoned the gold standard in 1931, the pound price plummeted, and gold standard countries followed suit, competing for foreign markets by devaluing their currencies. At that time, it was called a currency war, and the name "exchange dumping" also arose from this.</p>
<p>Mr. You Jian asks:</p>
<p>(1) After the abolition of the tael standard, is it still applicable to calculate the Shanghai-British fixed number using H.O. White's linked calculation method when calculating the London telegraphic transfer parity? How should it be calculated? Please provide an example.</p>
<p>(2) Based on the Shanghai Daily market price list, the HSBC listed British exchange rate and the British-US exchange rate in the overseas countries' exchange rate column, the calculated US exchange rate differs by one US dollar from the reported US exchange rate. What is the reason for this? Or is the calculation wrong? Can you give a specific example?</p>
<p>(3) Why are the British-US and US-British exchange rates different in the overseas countries' exchange rate column?</p>
<p>(4) On the 11th, in the financial news section of the Shanghai Daily's commercial news column, there is a sentence in the foreign exchange section: "Final shilling, three pence, four three seven five, US dollar, four yuan, six two five," but the market price list on that day lists the US exchange rate as 4.3125 yuan, and the British exchange rate is only three pence, which is quite different. What is the source of the market price list?</p>
<p>Please have the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute answer</p>
<p>(1) From the abolition of the tael system to the implementation of the legal tender policy, the external price was expressed in silver standard currency. The linked calculation method is still used to calculate the London telegraphic transfer parity. The calculation method is as follows:</p>
<p>? Pence = one yuan in silver standard currency</p>
<p>One silver coin = 23.4934483 grams of pure silver</p>
<p>31.10351 grams = 1 ounce</p>
<p>.925 ounces of pure silver = London market price of standard silver per ounce (i.e., the reported market price of silver bars)</p>
<p>.8165744 x London market price of standard silver per ounce = British exchange parity</p>
<p>If the market price of silver bars is 21 pence, then the British exchange parity should be:</p>
<p>.8165744 x 21 = 71.1479624 pence (i.e., the number of pence equivalent to one silver coin)</p>
<p>(2) The British-US exchange rate of 4.025 yuan in the overseas countries' exchange rate is the official exchange rate after the British unified foreign exchange. Those who want to do arbitrage cannot use this rate to exchange US dollars for shillings. The actual value of shillings must be based on the New York exchange market, that is, the US-British exchange rate in the overseas countries' exchange rate column. Those who want to do arbitrage can only exchange US dollars for shillings according to the US-British arbitrage rate. Therefore, the HSBC listed British exchange rate and US exchange rate should be adjusted based on the US-British arbitrage rate. Here is an example of the HSBC listed exchange rate and overseas countries' exchange rate on April 20, as reported in the Shanghai Daily commercial news. On that day, the British exchange rate was reported as four pence, the US exchange rate was 5.75 yuan, the British-US exchange rate in overseas countries was 4.025 yuan, and the US-British exchange rate was 3.515 yuan. Calculated based on the British-US exchange rate, the Shanghai US exchange rate should be: 6.607833 yuan. The calculation method is as follows: (to be continued)</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: A Review of the Foreign Exchange Market in the Past Week</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute, the foreign exchange market in the past week continued the trend of the previous week and remained in a hovering state. Excluding the bank settlement holiday on Monday and Tuesday, there were only four actual trading days. The highest US exchange rate was 6.34375 yuan, and the lowest was 6.0625 yuan. The highest British exchange rate was 4.03125 pence, and the lowest was 3.8125 pence. The factors causing fluctuations are said to be the following: (1) Song Ziwen's negotiations in the United States, (2) the tense situation in Hong Kong, and (3) the sale of gold from North China in Shanghai for arbitrage. Song has been in the United States for nearly two weeks, and although there have been reports of frequent contacts, the content is still unclear. Since the incident, the United States has twice publicly loaned money to China, once in December of the 27th year for 25 million yuan, and the second time in March of this year for 20 million yuan. With Song's reputation, going to the United States himself should not be difficult to obtain a loan. As for the form of the loan, it is still difficult to speculate. The recent contacts between Song and the Export-Import Bank may give a glimpse of the situation. However, Song has always advocated a sound financial policy and has had extraordinary ambitions in peacetime. The goal of this trip may have other important missions in addition to economic ones. Furthermore, it is unknown whether this loan will provoke stimulation from other parties, leading the government to strengthen the management of the foreign exchange market. The European situation is complex, and the Hong Kong situation is particularly tense. Traffic routes are gradually becoming a problem, and the demand for foreign exchange should decrease. However, it remains to be seen whether the situation in Shanghai can be stabilized as the Hong Kong situation deteriorates and how it will affect the market. Moreover, with the tension between Britain and Japan and the difficult relationship between the United States and Japan, those who are "escaping capital" have a sense of where the promised land is. Therefore, the market is hovering, and the trading volume is becoming increasingly small. This week, due to the gold dumping, the foreign exchange rate fluctuated accordingly. The reason for the sharp decline in gold is that the difference between the gold prices in North China and Shanghai is huge. The recent gold price in North China is about 4,600 yuan, while the Shanghai market is still above the high price of 5,000 yuan. Adding the premium between Tianjin and Shanghai, the profit from arbitrage is very high. Moreover, the legal gold price in Guanshan is only 2,200 yuan. If there is any arbitrary increase in prices or free trading, not only will it be confiscated, but there may even be criminal penalties. Those with gold in North China are deeply afraid that Tianjin will follow its example and want to sell as soon as possible. As a result, the gold price in Shanghai is falling. There is a link between exchange rates and gold prices. As the gold price falls, it will inevitably affect the foreign exchange market. In the past, merchants in North China hoarded too much merchandise, and prices have recently plummeted, causing serious damage and forcing them to sell gold to make up for the losses, resulting in the current phenomenon in the foreign exchange market. In addition, there is often a large supply of Japanese gold notes in the market, and prices are falling. In order to maintain the situation, the other party sells foreign exchange, which is another reason for the long position in the foreign exchange market. Although the foreign exchange rate rose slightly on Saturday due to the small US exchange rate report, the floor was very hard, and long positions were gradually released, eventually closing at the loosest price of the week.</p>
<h3>Financial Commentary, Ending July 6 (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>Negotiating another large credit loan with the United States to purchase metals, gasoline, automobiles, machinery, and other raw materials needed for construction, in order to complete a self-sufficient anti-Japanese economic policy, should be an essential endeavor. This is Song's second financial mission. —After the establishment of the second credit loan, China tried to borrow another 55 million yuan from the United States (see the Associated Press report on March 9 of this year).</p>
<p>However, what is involved here is more than just financial issues.</p>
<p>(3) Foreign Exchange, Gold, and Stocks</p>
<p>Because there were two days of bank semi-annual settlement holidays, there were only four days of activity in the financial market. According to the statistics for these four days, the market prices of foreign exchange and gold, regardless of opening or closing, high or low, can be said to be a completely upward trend. The fluctuation of the British exchange rate was 0.203125 pence, the fluctuation of the US exchange rate was 0.3125 cents, and the range of gold price fluctuations was 465 yuan. The stock market remained flat and sluggish.</p>
<p>The reason for the loosening trend in the foreign exchange market, in addition to the fact that the market was stiff on the 5th due to the excessive fall in British exchange, was that the tense Far East situation in the environment made it difficult for operators to manage, and Song's activities in the United States made the bulls feel that defeat was of no benefit, and success would be rewarded. Therefore, in a situation of profit, the market tended to be long. At the same time, the basic factor affecting the foreign exchange market still fell to the US-British exchange rate in New York. According to statistics since June 6, after the US-British exchange rate rose, the degree of strengthening of the British exchange rate in this city was only about 3%, while the degree of improvement of the US exchange rate reached about 10%. Therefore, in the absence of fluctuations in the US-British exchange rate, the Shanghai foreign exchange market may develop normally.</p>
<p>Several people in the industrial and financial circles in Shanghai recently formed a "China Stock Company Limited" which started operating on July 3, specializing in buying and selling Chinese stocks on behalf of customers, acting as agents for companies to recruit shares, issuing company bonds on behalf of companies, and all business related to stocks. It is said that the company's funds are 50,000 yuan, and the operating method is as follows: (to be continued)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Resumes Looseness</h3>
<p>The sugar market trend turned loose yesterday.

<h3>Seafood: Siamese Small Dried Mussels Continue to Decline Slightly, Eleven Yuan Lower Than Before</h3>
<p>Siamese small dried mussels, which had opened at 150 yuan in the previous market, were approximately sluggish and stagnant. The market situation was quite weak, and the sales price saw a continuous decline. The current transaction price is 139 yuan, which is eleven yuan lower than the previous market.</p>
<h3>Coal: Charcoal Prices Relax After Peak</h3>
<p>The charcoal market, which had seen Grade A charcoal reach a high of eleven yuan per dan (unit of weight) last month due to supply disruptions from Wenzhou, has seen a resurgence in supply with the resumption of shipping routes from Wenzhou and Taizhou. Prices have gradually weakened. Current wholesale prices are: Wenzhou Grade A charcoal at nine yuan and fifty cents per dan, Haimen flat cap charcoal at six yuan and seventy cents, and Huangyan charcoal at five yuan and eighty cents. Delivery charges are extra.</p>

<h3>Re-transcribing Old News: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (438) (From the Shenbao of the Twelfth Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>The Military Examinations (2)</p>
<p>The military examination system was a new practice of the Ming dynasty, which the current dynasty continues. Before the Yuan dynasty, it did not exist. The Ming dynasty established military examinations because it valued them. The generals and officers of various garrisons mostly came from formal paths of advancement, standing alongside those who rose through the ranks. Furthermore, those who rose through the ranks only received promotions based on their merits in battle, while those who passed the military examinations advanced according to their qualifications, giving them an advantage over those who rose through the ranks. In the current dynasty, the Manchu banner system is used, which is integrated with the Green Standard Army. As a result, military positions are primarily held by those from the banner system, while those who came through formal paths of advancement are given less importance. Therefore, although the system is inherited from the Ming dynasty, its intent is vastly different. I believe that even in the late Ming dynasty, what was practiced was used, and what was used was valued. Although it was ruined by civil officials, the military officials cannot be entirely absolved of the blame for losing battles and territory. Therefore, why should we hesitate to abolish the Ming dynasty's system? Some argue that in recent years, there is a growing emphasis on Western firearms. In addition to archery, horsemanship, swords, and stone throwing, it would be appropriate to also test on Western rifles, so that military officers who came through formal paths of advancement would not be inferior to those who rose through the ranks in terms of skills. Furthermore, the deficiencies in assigning official duties would be addressed. Sailors in the naval forces along the coast should also be allowed to participate in the examinations. By assessing their strengths, those skilled in firearms and naval warfare could also rise through the examination system. Additionally, military students in schools could also become proficient in firearms. By combining the paths of advancement for naval forces, army, and military students, the imbalance in importance can be avoided. This proposal is better than the proposal made by Governor-General Shen of Liangjiang last year to abolish the military examinations.</p>

<p>Food, Clothing, Housing and Transportation</p>
<h3>A Rhyme on the Four Essentials of Life: Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, people from various places who have some economic means have flocked to Shanghai to take refuge. As a result, housing prices have increased daily, making it very difficult. In recent years, due to various reasons, the prices of all goods have risen sharply. None of the four essential elements of life have been spared. Mr. Qian Shiqing is a thoughtful person. After retiring from his political career, he has been living in Shanghai, writing poetry and drinking wine to pass the time. Yesterday, he came to visit and showed me a recent poem he wrote on the four essentials of life, clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The language is elegant and insightful. It not only vividly depicts the current state of the isolated island but also contains advice to be frugal. I have recorded it in this publication for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Since the flames of war have spread across the Central Plains, this isolated island has become a haven for those seeking refuge, like a Peach Blossom Spring. The population has surged, and land has become scarce. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation have all become difficult. Silk has traditionally been a product of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and the cotton industry has also developed. However, many factories have now stopped production, making it difficult to find goods. In the past, silk cost five or six cents, but now it has risen to more than two yuan. A foot of cloth used to cost twelve or thirteen cents, but now it costs three times as much, and the quality has deteriorated. Since ancient times, people have regarded food as the most important thing. In prosperous times, a斗 (dǒu, a unit of dry measure) of rice was worth a hundred coins, but now a hundred gold coins can only buy two shi (石, another unit of dry measure). The coolies must work hard all year round. Hoarders accumulate goods and compete to be strange, storing them in thousands of warehouses. As a result, prices on the isolated island have skyrocketed, and the poor cannot even afford congee. Chewing on vegetable roots is considered frugal, but even that is hard to come by these days. Vegetable prices are so high that my purse is embarrassed. I want to gather薇 (wēi, a type of fern) on the side of Shouyang Mountain. I don't know the taste of meat. How can I enjoy a feast? Overeating is just a waste. Thinking of tasting a piece costs so much. Drilling wood to make fire is an ancient method that has disappeared. Coal briquettes are now widely used as fuel, but a lack of supply has driven up prices. We must learn from our ancestors to eat raw meat and drink blood. A place to sit and rest used to be easy to find, but on this small isolated island, it's hard to turn around. It's difficult to rent a dwelling, like Liang Hong's poverty. We should admire the birds that sing in the poems. Wang Ni had no house and slept in an exposed cart. Yuan Hong was willing to live in an earthen chamber. Where can we find a clean piece of land? Living in six places is barely enough. After being a high official, one shouldn't walk. Car prices are soaring, hindering travel. Walking is the best, so don't boast about owning a fancy carriage. Now I advise those who own property not to monopolize and seek profit. Letting go of profits will surely cause resentment. How about being generous and understanding the greater good? Now I also advise those who are temporarily residing here to be frugal with food, lodging, clothing, and footwear. Be content with poverty and wait quietly for the time to return home and complete the family home. You must know that this isolated island is not a paradise. It is difficult to live here for long like a swallow building a nest in a curtain or a fish in a cauldron. Moving to the mainland is easier to make a living, which is beneficial to both oneself and others.</p>
<h3>After Sweatshirts Become Expensive</h3>
<p>— Zhao</p>
<p>It's getting hot, and it's time to wear undershirts again. But this year's price of undershirts is really scary. The most basic ones cost about two yuan each! The better looking ones cost three or four yuan. At this time, rice costs 60 or 70 yuan per shi (石, unit of dry measure), and daily necessities are several times more expensive. The heavy pressure of life is making everyone breathless, so everyone is trying to save money on expenses. So, with undershirts so expensive this year, what should we use to replace undershirts? Yes, let me introduce you!</p>
<p>We can go to the fabric store to buy white linen (all colors are available) to tailor small, short-sleeved shirts without collars, like undershirts. Linen can be said to be the cheapest and most beautiful fabric for summer clothing. Each foot costs about thirty cents. Six feet is enough for a small, short-sleeved shirt with two feet of hem. Whether you sew it yourself or have a tailor sew it for you, it won't cost much. In short, the money spent on a linen shirt is definitely more economical than the price of an undershirt, and the degree of comfort and coolness is no less than that of the best undershirt!</p>
<h3>Summer Hometown Delicacies</h3>
<p>— Qiulang</p>
<p>I came to Shanghai to make a living and it has been more than ten years in a flash. But every summer, when "the days are as long as a small year," I always miss my hometown of Hangzhou, especially my hometown after the war. What has it become like? The beautiful mountains and clear waters of my hometown are of course always in my dreams, and the flavors of my hometown are also very famous. Although I can't taste them now, recalling that delicious taste makes me feel like Zhang Ji, who misses the water shield and perch. I often have saliva hanging from the corners of my mouth.</p>
<p>Wind-dried Meat: Wind-dried meat is a specialty of Hangzhou and a summer delicacy. Because it doesn't have the greasiness of fresh meat, it is richly fragrant, fatty, delicious but not greasy. It is most suitable for cooking with winter melon. It can be served with rice or as a side dish with wine, far superior to other dishes. Although Hangzhou's preserved meat shops all sell it, Wanlong Shop in Qinghefang is the most famous because the spices they use in the curing process are very accurate, so it is especially popular. Foreigners who go to Hangzhou must buy some to take back.</p>
<p>Double-inserted Melon: Double-inserted melon is also a specialty of Hangzhou. It is only available for a very short time. According to Hangzhou custom, each sauce garden opens its vats at the beginning of the first ten days of the hot season, and it is sold out after the middle ten days. Those that are sold again are called second-sweet melons. The most famous manufacturer of double-inserted melons should be Weihe Sauce Garden, followed by Hengtai and other gardens. The melon has a fresh, crisp, slightly sweet taste, which is very different from other pickled cucumbers. It is best served with porridge or added to soup and eaten with rice, which is light and refreshing. If you want to store it, just mix it with white sugar and dry it in the sun, so it can be stored for a long time and prepared for emergencies. People on isolated islands who want to taste these two delicacies can buy them from several stores that sell Hangzhou native products, but of course the prices are more expensive. Fortunately, Shanghai people are good at researching food. As long as they want to try something new, they will definitely not haggle over the small price.</p>
<h3>Living in Summer</h3>
<p>— Meizi</p>
<p>Living in the summer is the most annoying because, except for the general wealthy class, most people live in spaces as cramped as birdcages. Generally, five or six families live in an ordinary house, or at least two or three. Some even rent out the loft, sun deck, and kitchen. This can be barely tolerated in the spring, autumn, and winter, but it is miserable in the summer. Not only is there no air circulation, but there is also not much space for ventilation. So, if you don't think of a way, the suffering will definitely be even more unbearable. Here are a few points that I have thought of that may be helpful:</p>
<p>(1) Cleanliness. Since the space is low and small, it is easy to clean. You must diligently sweep every day to ensure that not a trace of dust remains. After sweeping, pour some disinfectant to sterilize. Garbage must be dumped at any time. In this way, you can indirectly reduce the production of bedbugs and other things, and you will not feel like you "can't sit still" inside.</p>
<p>(2) Eliminate mosquitoes and flies. Food that easily attracts flies, such as rice dishes, must be covered with a gauze cover. Other items, such as sweets eaten by children, must also be placed separately in boxes or bottles. Do not put them on the table at will, to avoid cockroaches and flies. As for mosquitoes, they will be reduced after the room is cleaned.</p>
<p>(3) Don't be too greedy for coolness. After going to bed at night, you must at least cover your abdomen with a thin sheet. It is better to let yourself sweat from the heat. This can avoid the onset of diseases in the autumn, because these diseases are caused by being greedy for coolness in the summer.</p>
<p>(4) Bathing problem. Now hot water has risen to one cent per scoop, and the bathing fee is also quite considerable. Therefore, apart from having a big bath during the sweltering heat, you only need to wipe your upper and lower body at other times. Wiping away sweat is very cool, so you can save this hot water fee!</p>
<h3>"Hollowing Out the Yellow Croaker"</h3>
<p>— Jinbi</p>
<p>There is a slang phrase popular among sailors: "Hollowing out the yellow croaker." What does "hollowing out the yellow croaker" mean? Outsiders are mostly baffled by them. It turns out that it is what they use to call those passengers who ride the white boat (i.e., without paying for a ticket).</p>
<p>Most of the people who "hollow out the yellow croaker" are country bumpkins and coolies. Some of them, of course, because it is not easy to earn money, would rather endure beatings and humiliation than pay for a boat ticket. (Most of these people are from Jiangbei.) But most of them are penniless and cannot survive in the city, and they lack travel expenses to return to their hometown. So they have no choice but to take the risk and disregard face. "Hollowing out the yellow croaker" is what they do.</p>
<p>Other people who "hollow out the yellow croaker" are much luckier. They have fellow villagers or relatives who are stewards, sailors, or cooks on the boat. They don't need to "hollow out the yellow croaker" in the first place, but they always want to save some money if they can. So they also take this route. But they are much more "relaxed" than the first type of "hollowers." They don't need to play hide-and-seek with the ticket inspectors. They can lie on the bunks of the stewards, sailors, or cooks without worry. When the ticket inspector passes by, they just temporarily cover their heads with a quilt and can get through.</p>
<p>Before the war, if the first type of "hollower" was discovered, the people on the boat mostly urged him to buy a ticket. But when he really couldn't come up with the money, they would at most threaten to strip off his clothes or pretend to tie him up with ropes. When they saw that they really couldn't squeeze any oil out of him, they would scold him a few times after being persuaded by others and let it go. As for the second type of "hollower," everyone was one of their own. Since there were acquaintances on the boat, they would let it go easily.</p>
<p>Now it's different. Before, almost half of the large and small boats that traveled on the Yangtze River and inland rivers were forcibly occupied by a certain party. They are very strict in their surveillance, and nothing can be accommodated. Even "hollowing out the yellow croaker," the first type cannot be let go as easily as before. On the contrary, they are often subjected to insults and beatings. A few days ago, on a steamboat that went to Beisha, a Jiangbei man who was "hollowing out the yellow croaker" was reportedly forced to jump into the Yangtze River and commit suicide. The second type of "hollower" can no longer be as carefree as before. It is said that a certain party has been cracking down recently. If this type of "hollower" is found on the boat, the steward, sailor, or cook who is related to him will also be suspended from business.</p>
<p>Alas! Even "hollowing out the yellow croaker" is not what it used to be.</p>

<h3>(35) Arrowhead and Taro Balls</h3>
<p>— Drafted by Luo Feng</p>
<p>Ingredients: Eggs, Taro, Arrowhead, MSG, Spicy Soy Sauce, Sweet Sauce, Pure White Water Chestnut Flour, Oil, Salt</p>
<p>Preparation: First wash the taro, boil it until it is soft, and then mash it. Mix the mashed taro with eggs and pure white water chestnut flour. Then cut the arrowhead into small pieces, add an appropriate amount of MSG, salt, and sweet sauce, and mix together. Then take the mixed taro and make round ball shells, using the mixed arrowhead sauce as the ball filling, the smaller the better. After making the balls, fry them in a frying pan. When they are fried until they are yellow and firm, they should be taken out immediately. Serve with spicy soy sauce, which is most suitable. This dish is very nutritious.</p>
<h3>(36) Raw Mixed Sichuan Tofu</h3>
<p>— Drafted by Pan Deji</p>
<p>(Sixth Summer Dish)</p>
<p>Ingredients: Soft tofu, Sichuan vegetables (i.e., pickled mustard tuber), soybean oil or raw oil, MSG, scallions, fine salt</p>
<p>Preparation: Remove the skin of the soft tofu. Cut the Sichuan vegetables and scallions into small pieces and place them in the tofu. Add an appropriate amount of MSG and fine salt, and stir slightly with chopsticks. Then heat the oil until it is cooked, pour it over the tofu, and mix well again. Eat it immediately. It is fresh, delicious, hygienic, and rich in vitamins.</p>
<p>If you want to buy "MSG" and oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, please call "44194." A special delivery will be made immediately without a delivery charge. Pouring some sesame oil on it is also light and flavorful, and it can be served with rice like ham and winter melon soup.</p>
<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Monday: Ham and winter melon soup, vinegared yellow croaker slices, snow vegetable braised tofu, sweet sauce braised eggplant</p>
<p>Tuesday: Onion and beef strips, dry-fried salted ribbonfish, green vegetables fried with bean curd sheets, dried shrimp mixed with dried tofu strips</p>
<p>Wednesday: Stir-fried pork strips with mushrooms, sweet and sour pomfret, mushroom and dried vegetable soup, stewed stinky tofu</p>
<p>Thursday: Vermicelli and beef slices, snow vegetable stewed cuttlefish, braised vegetarian ten-scene dish, chives mixed with tofu</p>
<p>Friday: Pork and tofu soup, cucumber stir-fried with small shrimp, braised cabbage, stir-fried long beans</p>
<p>Saturday: Sweet potato and beef soup, salted fish braised with tofu, vegetarian ten-scene casserole, snow vegetable and bean sprouts</p>
<p>Sunday: Meat stewed with eggs, fried yellow croaker, stir-fried spinach, steamed eggplant</p>
<p>The dishes we eat in summer, whether they are meat or vegetarian, should always be light and flavorful. Overly rich dishes are not suitable for summer. The most light and flavorful meat dish in summer is ham and winter melon soup. When you hear the word ham, you will definitely be startled, thinking that ham is something for the nobles. How can it be included in an economic menu? Although 70 ham is expensive, there are also economical ways to eat it. When you buy ham at the ham store, you don't have to buy the upper or middle part of the loin. Just buy the shoulder, which costs about one yuan. When you buy it back, you can cut a few slices at any time and make soup with winter melon. My family bought a shoulder and can use it four or five times. Although there are not many slices, the soup is still very flavorful. For vegetarian soup, use dried vegetables, mushrooms, and edamame.</p>
<h3>Stalin's Daily Life</h3>
<p>— Maode</p>
<p>When it comes to the Soviet Union, everyone knows Stalin. He is the leader of the Communist Party and the central figure in Soviet politics. He is not only the leader of a country, but also the leader of international communists. However, since the great changes in the European war situation, the Soviet Union is also trying to expand its territory, so Stalin's every move is enough to make the world pay attention. Here I record some information about his daily life.</p>
<p>Stalin gets up before six o'clock every morning. After washing his face, he goes to the Kremlin garden for a walk for ten minutes. After returning, he opens and reads his private letters and newspapers, which takes about an hour to complete. At seven-thirty, he has a light breakfast, two pieces of bread, a cup of tea. At eight o'clock, he takes a car to Sfolanla, the office of the Central Committee. His office is a narrow and sparsely furnished small room. He sits at a half-new desk, listening to the reports of his subordinates. He always maintains a silent attitude and does not speak rashly unless he has waited for the other party to finish speaking and completely understands the true meaning of what they said. Then he makes his judgment. From nine o'clock, he officially starts working, and does not have lunch until two o'clock in the afternoon. In an emergency, the time is even longer. At lunch, he puts his pipe next to him and smokes while waiting for the dishes to be served. The dishes are very simple, but he likes to drink alcohol, likes meat, soup, or gravy, and finally eats some bread. After the meal, he takes advantage of the two or thirty minutes of free time to walk in front of the corridor.</p>
<p>At three o'clock, he continues to work. He usually finishes around ten o'clock, and goes home for dinner. Sometimes, if he does not finish his work for the day, he will not leave the office. If necessary, he even sleeps in his office and does not go home. He once said: "Work is my life." This shows how loyal he is to service, but his enjoyment in daily life can be said to be extremely simple and civilianized.</p>
<p>In short, Stalin works very hard for eleven hours a day, and spends the rest of his time reading, playing chess, thinking, and writing. Sometimes he goes to the opera house to listen to opera, or to the cinema to watch movies. Therefore, his bedtime is always after one o'clock in the middle of the night, and he sleeps only five hours on average per day. However, his physique can still be compared to heavy granite.</p>

<h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>After this publication published two articles on the YMCA subsidizing poor students, yesterday we received an article from Mr. Mei Ji on "Encroaching on Poor Student Scholarships," and Mr. Liu also sent a report (both published later). This is naturally a noteworthy fact.</p>
<p>Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. The establishment of poor student scholarships seems to have all advantages and no disadvantages, but the articles published below clearly tell us that disadvantages have unfortunately also occurred.</p>
<p>To eliminate these disadvantages, I agree with the two points mentioned by Mr. Mei Ji. Because the parties involved are only schools (institutions) and students, eliminating these disadvantages is naturally the joint responsibility of both parties.</p>
<p>If you are a student with a comfortable family economic situation, in all respects, you should not fill the only way for those who are poor and unable to go to school. On the contrary, you should also subsidize them to make up for the lack of school or institutional scholarships. As for wasting the tuition fees obtained by encroachment on the field of entertainment, that is an even more unforgivable crime.</p>
<p>The various schools and institutions that set up poor student tuition fees must seek accurate information in the investigation, which of course cannot be ignored, because this is not an act of fishing for fame and praise, but just seeking to fill the quota. The money and energy you spend must receive equal value in return.</p>
<p>I hope that this bad phenomenon will be quickly eliminated under the strict review and implementation of both parties. Then the poor students will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>Admission Ticket Collection Point</h3>

<p>After going to the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road to get an "Application Form for Student Relief," I spent a morning busily finding guarantors and the principal, finally filling it out carefully. In the afternoon, I couldn't wait any longer and went to exchange it for the admission ticket.</p>
<p>There were quite a few people, small groups of students constantly flowing in and out of the YWCA's entrance. Especially at the place where application forms were obtained, which was also where admission tickets were exchanged, the students crowded around, densely surrounding a clerk. After waiting for quite a while, I finally managed to move forward, and then took out my photo, academic report card, and application form.</p>
<p>The clerk casually asked the person next to me, "Is this your own?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Then a photo was pasted onto the admission ticket, and the procedure was complete.</p>
<p>When it was my turn, I handed the required items to the clerk, finally able to take a breath and look around. At that moment, I felt extremely strange because, around me, those exchanging for admission tickets mostly looked like young masters; one was wearing a crisp white serge suit, another had his hair permed somewhat like a woman's, and even more... In short, from their attire and behavior, one could tell that their families certainly wouldn't be unable to afford tuition. The female students were the same: applying face cream, curling their hair, and using various other extremely wasteful cosmetics. I thought, even if they saved on these, it could cover a semester's worth of book fees.</p>
<p>"Applying for relief? Is the subsidy meant for you?" I couldn't help but feel a jealous thought towards these young masters and misses. The reason the application office was so busy, the reason collecting admission tickets was so crowded, I blamed it all on them. I said resentfully in my heart, "Who is infringing on the rights of us poor students!"</p>
<p>After completing the procedure, upon exiting, I even saw some "impoverished students" wearing high-heeled leather shoes and buying a popsicle to cool off. Are they deceiving or just pretending?</p>
<h3>Swimming Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Qiang</p>
<p>Before entering the water, do several minutes of warm-up exercises and deep breathing to make the limbs flexible. Use cotton to plug the ear canals to prevent ear canal inflammation. After exiting the water, do a full-body dry rub to avoid catching a cold.</p>
<p>Do not swim alone, to prevent no one being available for rescue. Do not swim after eating a full meal, to prevent hindering digestion. Do not swim after strenuous exercise, to prevent the risk of cramps.</p>
<p>If you experience cramps in the water, which is the most dangerous situation, immediately exit the water and massage the affected area with the palm of your hand, or apply hot water.</p>
<h3>The Difficulties of Library Staff (A Reply to Mr. Nai Liu)</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Nai Liu's great work for three days, talking about the shortcomings of our library, we, standing in the position of the librarians, besides being ashamed of the inadequacy of our work, are even more grateful to Mr. Nai Liu for giving us very sincere corrections.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Mr. Nai Liu said, sleepy readers are often found in the library's reading room. Of course, the best way is to hope that these napping readers can understand the rules of public places and not hinder public interests as a prerequisite, but in reality, things won't always be so satisfactory, because readers also vary in quality, so this situation is inevitable. Since this is the case, then it is up to the management staff to pay attention; but we also have many difficulties. Because the library's financial expenditure is limited, the manpower is of course also limited, but the work is getting busier day by day, so the management staff cannot allocate work as desired: for example, the reading room only has one manager, he (or she) not only has to manage the number of people entering and exiting, the number of reading cards, but also has to place books and packages. These three tasks already make it impossible for the manager to frequently leave his post to look for readers who are napping or taking too many books; and the readers who are napping mostly sleep very cunningly in corners that are not easily visible, making it difficult for the manager to find them. Therefore, I believe the most thorough solution is to hope that enthusiastic readers will give us more help. If there are such situations, we hope that readers will advise each other, or tell our manager to enforce the rules. In this way, I think we can definitely achieve good results. Of course, these effects are all given to the library by the readers. I wonder what Mr. Nai Liu and the library's readers think? Why not give it a try?</p>
<p>A side note: Since the library recently implemented book inspection, we have discovered that many books have been scribbled on, and a few have been torn out. Although there are still ways to remedy the situation, the most important thing is for all readers to practice the virtue of protecting books. In addition, there are also one or two readers who believe that our book inspection is not thorough enough and should be more detailed. We certainly accept this, and in the past, present, and even the future, we will always strive to achieve the principle of "absolute accuracy." This point can be reassuring to the readers.</p>
<p>Finally, we still hope that readers will provide guidance in various aspects. In short, the library belongs to the public!</p>
<h3>Encroaching on Impoverished Student Scholarships</h3>
<p>— Mei Ji</p>
<p>The YWCA saw the extreme seriousness of the problem of students dropping out of school, so it allocated a portion of its funds to establish impoverished student scholarship quotas to reward students from impoverished families with excellent academic performance. This is indeed good news for students who are unable to afford but are determined to pursue further education. Now, many schools are also taking this measure, which is certainly a good deed worthy of our joint efforts.</p>
<p>However, some students whose families are relatively well-off, upon seeing that the school has taken this measure, often harbor selfish thoughts: "I might as well apply and try. If the school approves, wouldn't I be able to get extra 'money for expenses' for nothing? If the school doesn't approve, that's okay too." They disregard the problem of weaker students' ability to further their education, and because they have obtained the money effortlessly through deception, they will also easily misuse it.</p>
<p>Our school has also established impoverished student scholarship quotas. Many outstanding students from impoverished families or those affected by the war have requested it, of course, but not a few students who are able to afford further education have also requested it. The school's review process certainly cannot be completely thorough, so these scholarship quotas will also be occupied by those students who are able to afford further education.</p>
<p>You must know that the impoverished student scholarship quotas established by various schools and institutions are limited. If you occupy a quota, other truly impoverished students will have one less quota? In other words, there will be one more young person dropping out of school. Therefore, I hope that in the future, various schools and institutions that offer impoverished student scholarships will ensure thoroughness in the review process to eliminate this undesirable phenomenon. I further hope that those applying for scholarships will first assess their own family's financial situation to determine whether they are indeed impoverished before applying, and refrain from encroaching on the only tuition fees of general students who are determined but unable to afford further education.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Investigation</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>He said in surprise, "Strange, how are both arms bare, without even a watch?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne exhaled a puff of smoke and said slowly, "This is another link in the complex problem."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou seemed not to understand. "What does this mean?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "Originally there was. Look, isn't there a mark on her left wrist? But it doesn't look like a watch, maybe a bracelet. Also, on the ring finger of her left hand and on her ears, there are traces of having worn rings and earrings. Although there are no signs of struggle on her body, the dried blood on the ear holes clearly indicates that it was left when the earrings were removed."</p>
<p>At this moment, the two porters were about to cover the body with a white sheet. Ni Jinshou waved his hand to stop them, squatted down, and looked closely at the places Hawthorne mentioned. Only then did I understand the origin of the dried blood I had just seen on her ears.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Indeed, this adds another layer of trouble."</p>
<p>After the sheet was put on, the other two porters carried the stretcher out. Qin Mozhai followed behind, and when he reached the door, he turned back and added:</p>
<p>"Mr. Hawthorne, Inspector Ni, I hope you will achieve final victory!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne replied, "Thank you. After the work of the forensic examiner is completed, I also hope you will report to Inspector Ni as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Qin Mozhai nodded. "Okay, but Dr. Bai went to Zhenru for official business at dawn today. I don't know when he will be back. As soon as there are results, I will definitely not delay." He walked out.</p>
<p>After this small disturbance ended, the terrifying atmosphere in the room seemed to lessen somewhat. Hawthorne waved to Jinmei again, asking her to come closer. He and Ni Jinshou also returned to their original seats. Ni Jinshou took out his notebook again.</p>
<p>Hawthorne asked, "Jinmei, what jewelry was Miss Wang wearing when she went out last night?"</p>
<p>The maid seemed to think for a moment and replied, "I didn't notice, but she often wore a gold bracelet inlaid with small diamonds when she went out. Maybe she wore it out last night too."</p>
<p>"What kind of ring did she usually wear?"</p>
<p>"A diamond ring, the diamond is as big as a soybean." (38)</p>
