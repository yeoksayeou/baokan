<p>社評</p>
<h3>北歐戰爭的演變</h3>
<p>德國軍事向北歐發展之後，兵不血刃而即控制了丹麥全境，佔領了挪威主要海口，如果拿破崙所謂「戰爭是謀地位的控制」，這句話，在近代的戰爭上仍有其重要的意義，則北歐初步的戰爭，德國已佔先了一着。德國一舉而卞奧斯陸，貝爾根，波多依，那維克，在海上坐待英法來攻，在陸地則追擊挪軍，直逼唐巴斯。在這一階段的德軍戰略，要在英法軍隊未與挪威軍取得聯絡以前，先使挪軍無容身之地，然後悉力以應付海上來攻之央法軍隊；而英法之所急者，亦為從海上迅速登陸，以援挪軍於未敗，使德國腹背受敵，非但不能控制挪威全境，且使無立足之地。至目前為止，英　軍隊已在特隆漢北部之索爾斯及杜爾斯登岸；據英法方面消息，已與挪威軍隊取得聯絡，並將哈瑪城克復。這是英法方面登陸的初步成功，當然未足衡重全局的勝敗；而此後雙方之爭奪戰，必將更趨激烈；是以挪威方面今後的戰報，値得拭目以待的。雖然，北歐方面可能的演進，却不限於軍事。</p>
<p>希特勒領導之下的德國，有兩種獨擅勝塲的法門：一種是「閃電戰術」，以軍事的迅速行動，覆滅弱小國家；一種是「分化戰術」以政治的方式，達其不戰而勝的目的。閃電戰術是以精密的科學為基礎，分化戰術是帝國主義嫡傳的衣缽；蓋自來帝國主義獵取殖民地，常以土著糾織軍隊為其前衛，使之自相殘殺，然後征服之。德團在挪威的軍事行動，不能像在丹麥一樣，控制了合法的政府為其工具，於是找了一個季士林為傀儡，來供其利用。季士林的與德國國社黨有關係，早已是幾年前的事。不過斯干蒂那維亞各國，不但各有其根深蒂固的民族主義，幷目早就受了民主主義的洗禮，這與德國國社主義是根本格格不相入的。季士林所組織的國民中央黨，在一九三三年希特勒登台時，雖有一度膨脹，可是後來因為牠自身的分裂，以及民衆的不予信任，因此久在消沉之中。這决希特勒侵入挪威後，想搬季士林上台；而季士林居然袍笏登塲，發表所謂政綱，也是撇開政黨政治，謂將以經濟團體及文化團體為基礎，組織新議會，實行眞正的民主政治云云。這是把國社黨「職團政治」的理論，移植於挪威，而便其背後的主子統治挪威。不料不能叫座，挪威軍民固仍一致擁護合法政肘，以與德國作戰，並且傀儡政府中的外相赫斯伏夫，也棄職而逃。最近且有季士林內閣辭職，由奧斯陸市長組織行政委員會管領德國新佔領區的消息。這已證明德國在挪威所用的閃電戰術，半途遭遇了堅强抵抗，自此不能不從事廣大而經久的陣地戰；所用的分化戰術也不適用於民族意識旺盛的挪威。德國而企圖控制挪威全境，萬無速戰速決之望，萬無取巧之地、惟有以眞刀眞槍，與英法挪聯盟軍相拚而已。</p>
<p>挪威的整個佔領，不但軍需原料，可供德國之用，並且在軍事上，也可以陷瑞典於絕境，而令其自動投於德國的懷抱、，蓋將一石投了英法挪三烏，且得一箭雙鵰而有瑞典挪威。瑞典雖聲明絕對中立，德國也聲明承認其中立，戰事的範圍雖暫時丕致波及瑞典，但戰爭的蔓延，每每不受理智所預定，何况德國以閃電戰術與分化戰術為其得意的傑作，在德國對瑞典有所情不自禁，在瑞典對德國有所勢不自安。蓋就瑞典內情而論，當局雖努力於强化其統一的政權，但國內接近國社主義的政黨不止一個，例如瑞典國家社會黨，以福魯加為領袖，以「瑞典復興」為口號，而其黨徽也是　字形；在一九三三年間，與國家社會黨勞工合併，而由最近被瑞典政府搜捕的林特霍姆任領袖。又如國家社會黨集團，由愛克斯脫洛姆　戈林前妻之弟羅森伯爵為領袖。這許多政治團體雖沒有多大的勢力，然企圖醞釀政變，推翻政府，掠取政權，促瑞典投向德國國社黨旗幟之下，這是公開的秘密；倘若沒有外援為他造就機會，當然不能有何成就。及至現在，火燄旣已延及斯干蒂那維亞，使瑞典外有威脅的勢力，內有潛伏的叛徒，然則季士林之倫正未必不出現於瑞典。德國秘密警察的領袖希墨萊曾經公開地講過：「在未來的戰爭中，我們不但在陸上前綫有陸軍，水上有海軍，空中有空軍，並且我們還要有戰爭舞台上的第四方面軍隊—德國人在內部」。這種德國人潛在內部的分化戰術，一見之於奧地利，再見之於捷克，三見之於但澤。四見之於挪威；吾們從文明與道德的見地，祝望其不五見，抑且永久絕跡於人羣。</p>
<h3>日發言人又稱　尊重外人權益　維持東印度現狀問題　美日兩國未成立諒解</h3>
<p>東京　外務省發言人、今晨招待各報記者時、會根據詳紀日大使堀內與美國務卿赫爾會晤情形之華盛頓官電、發表談話、謂日本駐美大使與美國務鄉之間、對於維持荷屬東印度現狀事、並未臻於任何諒解、且日美兩國所處之地位、亦不宜成立此項諒解云、該發言人續稱、美國務卿向日大使探詢日本對華之態度時、日大使當吿以日政府之意、係欲實踐其給予各國之保證、維持中國門戶開放、並對在華第三國家致相富之尊重、日政府保障第三國在華權益之政策、始終並無變更、目前局勢之造成、實由於大規模戰事仍在華進行之故、渠望各第三國將能諒解此項環境云、某記者又提出問話、謂日大使與美國務卿會談之結果、日美兩國對於荷屬東印度現狀之維持、是否已抱相同之見解、該發言人答稱、日大使當時會向美國務卿說明有田外相上星期一日所發關於荷屬東印度現狀之言論、及日政府對此問題之態度、（二十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>颶風暴雨　襲美海岸</h3>

<h3>美郵政部長　廣播演說　擁護現行政策</h3>
<p>波士頓　郵政部長法萊（民主黨總統候選人之一）、昨晚在此間發表廣播演說、對於美國現行政策、即以避不牽入戰事漩渦為目標之政策、表示擁護、並稱道赫爾國務卿所推行之商業政策、主張西半球各國、應相互合作、略謂、「西半球之防衛、有賴於西半球各國之合作、至於美洲安全之基本條件、厥在不容任何外國插足於新大陸、彼世界其他部份、倘始終與否人重洋間隔、相距於三千英里之外、則防衛問題、固極簡單、但美國必須擁有强大之陸海軍、庶幾美洲大陸各鄰國需要援助時、即可出而相助」云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日報鼓吹　與蘇妥協　同時反反美論調</h3>
<p>東京　此間各報咸稱、蘇聯對日將作新的親善表示、外國各觀察家對於此種論調、頗為重視、並謂美國國務卿赫爾日前就荷屬東印度問題發出聲明、主張維持現狀、避不干涉其內政之後、日本各報即持反美　調、同時對於蘇聯遽作此種推測、其間抑揚擒縱、若合符節、於以見日本境內行將發生一種新運動、以進步派革人為背景、而標榜反美為內政上之主要主義、據同盟社外交問題記者對日本國內發出消息稱、蘇聯似確有解決蘇日兩國間各種懸案之誠意、該國對於歐戰、雖仍以保守中立為主、但實際上正以援助德國為事、且正注視巴爾幹半島、近東與印度各地、職楚之故、該國須在遠東方面保有行動自由、其亟謀改善對日關係、殆即以此、此外、都新聞持同樣論調、並論日本政府在接受的束之前、應先縝密注視蘇聯態度、藉知是否本諸眞誠、雖蘇聯態度向少誠意、要亦未必即為日本之世響、該國倘能明瞭日本政府樹立「東亞新秩序」之眞實意願、並能積極與日本合作、日本自當不稍遲疑、即與蘇聯握手言歡、中外商業新聞亦載稱、蘇聯政府因歐戰延及巴爾幹半島、危險性日大之故似有改變遠東政策之可能、該國處此情况之下、自以在西伯利亞邊境保持和平為得計、顧蘇聯反覆無常、日本對蘇談判未有不歸失敗者、政府當局務勿疎虞、（二十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>越南大規模　擴充軍備</h3>

<p>「自捷克事件發生後、英國輿論及政府均引起極大之變動、認為英國已需要强有力之措施、而不能再事寬容、但一般妥協派如西門爵士之流、僉主張英國應以防護帝國利益為前提、中歐東歐及德國發展之範圍、英國可以退出、無所損失、此輩入士同時希望德蘇兩國發生磨擦、德國佔領捷克、發生困難、俾英法雖退出東歐及中歐、而德國亦不能高枕無憂、此輩妥協派人士、一面主張限制英國利益範圍之活動、一面更主張簽訂英法穌波聯合宜言、關於此事、英蘇關係頗値注意、當英國海外貿易大臣赫德森、訪問華沙草斯科之時、余曾有詳細報吿、陳述英國方面、極願在政治上增進英蘇關係之意願、但蘇俄方面、似乎不　熱衷、莫斯科對於簽訂聯合宣言、提山附帶條件、其內容如何、迄今並未宜佈、但據所知、蘇俄提出條件之中、有以波蘭之加入為簽訂之宜言之條件者、（註、此事係余在外交部所探悉、但蘇俄表示否認、）無論如何、英蘇關係已不若英國初發起時之款洽、當法總統勒勃倫訪問倫敦時、余在招待席上、數度與蘇俄大使邁斯基相値、渠對近來局勢之發展、甚表滿意、亦以見英蘇關係之最近眞象矣、</p>

<h3>美駐遠東兩使節　在日有重要會商　駐菲專員昨來滬卽赴東京　與格魯商討應付未來局勢　美決心維護現狀</h3>
<p>美國駐菲列賓專員塞爾、昨乘美國亞洲艦隊旗艦奧古斯德號、業於昨日上午十一時抵滬、該艦泊浦江中海軍浮筒、美國駐滬官員、均往迎迓、復以該艦於上月二十三日在菲島南部觸礁、故在滬之美海軍卷屬、聞該艦抵滬消息、昨晨均佇候碼頭、俾得聆悉其良人之近狀、是以情形更為然烈而緊張、茲記塞爾氏談話及其他情形於後、</p>
<p>劇變局勢如何應付</p>
<p>據塞爾結大中社記者稱、渠此行係赴日本、訪問美國駐日大使格魯、就最近國際局勢劇變後而發生之種種問題、商討應付辦法、因此行之目的、即在使美國政府與各駐外使節、能保持其更密切之接觸、以應付未來劇變之局勢、惟塞爾否認此行將與日本商談荷屬東印度問題、渠稱、當渠決定出發前、荷屬東印度問題、根本尙未發生、但對此行或將與駐日大使格魯、商談太平洋上一般之局勢、則不加以否認、</p>
<p>太平洋應保持現狀</p>
<p>渠稱、目前美國一般的意見、均認為太平洋上形勢、有保持具原有現狀之必要、渠又對以武力國策之國家、大事攻擊、認為此種侵略行為、足以摧毀數千年苦心所經營之人類文化、而美國之國策、乃在以人道的合法的手段、保持此等苦心之結晶品、渠認為如現狀被變更、則混亂　追踵而至、</p>
<p>美與菲島同一步調</p>
<p>至論及菲列　各界對荷屬東印度問題之觀察、渠稱、菲列賓目前內部頻多問題、故菲人士之注意力、皆集中於該項問題之上、對將來之情形、吾人自極難預料、但吾人可斷言、前菲列賓與美採取同一之見解、即保持太平洋之均勢也、</p>
<p>獨立問題尚待攷慮</p>
<p>至談及菲列賓獨立問題、塞爾稱、菲列賓人獨立、尙待美國參衆兩院之正式通過、但渠認為除非世界形勢在最近四年中有重大之變更、菲列賓獨立問題、必可實現、但「無論如何、目前吾人尙難對此項問題、加以逆料、蓋此項問題、尙待美政府當局作縝密之玫慮也、」</p>
<p>在滬小駐定期赴日</p>
<p>最後渠又聲明　、美國目前並不欲統制更大區域、美政府所以遲遲未使菲獨立者、無非欲使其能得更多自治之能力耳、塞爾氏定本月廿八日離滬赴日、現下榻華懋飯店、並在領事館設辦公處、渠希望能於五月廿二日返馬尼刺、</p>
<p>旗艦觸礁業經修復</p>
<p>又據該艦艦員談、該艦觸礁地點、在菲島南部哥龍灣、其處面積甚狹、但港中向未聞有礁石、當該艦於昏夜中徐徐駛抵該處停泊時、不幸竟致觸礁、艦身雖未受傷、但推進機已形成灣曲、舵部損壞甚重、已有數處破裂、無法行駛、故乃進行修理工作、惟以工作人員過少、耗時　多、致該艦被迫留於馬尼刺達一周之久、</p>

<p>前日過滬</p>
<p>阿部信行大將等一行、已於前日乘鹿島丸抵滬、有謂鹿島丸係六時進淞口、日方即於此時派專輪至江心迎阿部登陸者、有謂阿部係下午三時在匯山碼頭於嚴密戒備中登陸者、以日方嚴守秘密、日方通訊社及報紙、前昨均被禁止刊載、故無法證明、惟在昨日新申報社評中、透露消息、謂阿部係晨光中抵滬、</p>
<p>所謂任務</p>
<p>據日方傳出消息、阿部赴南京後、將根據　中國政府人民所反對之近衛三原則、開始檢討關於「和平方案」之條約化、擬化旣成事實為條件、冉化條件為法律、然後日本可以利用此一條件、併吞滿蒙、封鎖華中、控制華南、北自黑龍江、南至海南島、上達天空氣象、下至地底礦藏、中則由東以至西北、由領海以至於內河、無不佔有、無不控制、將第三國權益、完全排除、而逐第三國於遠東以外、可見阿部此行任務之重要也、</p>

<h3>虹橋飛機場　日軍築營　靑紗幛起　將有戰事</h3>

<p>田野穀物</p>
<p>已長、藉以掩蔽、襲擊日兵、擊斃數名、日軍乃施嚴厲報復、「據今巳確悉者、本月十五日晨、日軍開抵距虹橋飛機塲不數哩之諸翟鎭、指平民藏匿游擊隊、竟殘殺平民不下四百人、焚毀房屋八百椽、以資洩憤、惟當時該鎮並無游擊隊、日兵縱火後、見火勢不足焚毀屋宇者、即</p>
<p>澆以火油</p>
<p>以促火勢熾烈、並向脫身逃逸之平民、開搶射擊、數日前、日軍又在滬郊其村縱火殘殺無辜、某　舨船主之妻、身中流彈、十九日送來上海人醫院治療、巳於二十一日重傷殞命、」云云、現在諸翟確實狀况尙無報吿、姑誌之、以待證明、</p>

<h3>美著名作家艾摩萊　觀測歐戰動向　戰綫南延並非不可能　經濟方面英法佔優勢</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、美國著名國際與經濟問題者作家艾摩萊博士、來遠東考察、頃抵上海、向記者暢談國際大勢、略稱、美國今須抱「深切之關心」、而注視歐洲與遠東、歐局之發展、對於遠東、勢必有强烈影響、</p>
<p>美艦姿勢</p>
<p>惟美國在太平洋保持具艦隊、並非對付日本之姿勢、其目的乃在維持太平洋之現狀、且美艦駐太平洋已歷數年、苟調駐大西洋、徒足增加歐局之緊張、斯堪的那維亞半島戰事爆發、乃歐戰戰綫擴大之開始、或將促使巴爾幹半島戰事之早日勃發、</p>
<p>戰綫趨向</p>
<p>因德國侵入丹挪兩國後、協約國或將在巴爾幹半島與土蘇邊界有所行動也、德國侵挪動機、端在防杜協約國加强其對該區之控制、穗國似久有佔據丹挪兩國之計劃、惟待協約國首先行動、德國在丹麥、或能獲得若干金屬、但挪威並無有價値之原料、故德國此次侵挪勝利、則所得當以戰略上的利益為最重要、即保障瑞典鐵砂及他種必要品之運德、及阻止協約國獲得加緊其對鎖之重要地位是、</p>
<p>北歐戰局北歐戰事、頗少局部化之望、而瑞典今有遭侵略之虞、或未能　免直接參戰、協約國對　馬尼亞用兵、藉以進攻德國、並控制羅國油田、並非不可能事、至此、巴爾幹半島亦起戰事、而蘇聯以油供給德國、協約國或將決計加以截斷以加緊對德封鎖、則從北歐至近東全綫、將勃發大規模戰事、或竟將蘇聯捲入戰渦、</p>
<p>優劣判斷</p>
<p>以經濟戰爭言、英法大佔優勢、海軍方面亦然、德　軍之編制與訓練均稱優良、但其最高指揮官之才能、殆較世界大戰時之德陸軍司令為遜色云、按艾博士定今日（二十二日）赴南京一行、然後取道菲島返美、</p>

<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、因本日銀根益見緊枯、滙劃貼現已出百元關口、故疲勢依然未脫、價向下游、惟跌數有限、乃人心不因低落而氣餒、見機　吸者頗不乏人、晨初因匯市報長、遂較週六撳低三十五元、開盤為五千七百五十五元、稍待銀號帮金號扒興頓萌、購進若干、塲內頻添買氣不少、致價回高至五千七百七十五元、不久錢兌業證券帮俱來猛吐、價乃不支、而降見五千七百五十元、全日低價、後曾步起二十元、但午收僅為五千七百五十五元、午後開前市氣巳轉、迨至開盤、人心突佳、已漲至五千七百八十元、終因散戶售出不斷、籌碼供過於求、卒至五千七百七十元收盤、結果續小二十元、全天交易的二千兩光景、銀樓飾金掛小五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋跌廿元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開匯兌報長、美滙吿鬆、是以人心帶疲、開市即撳小三十五元、錢兌業出金號五十兩、為五千七百五十五元、嗣有金號肯進、銀號跟買、立回升二十元、銀號互做二十兩為五千七百七十五元、比後證劵帮錢兌業等先後爭先力賣、雖某金號陸續代客收買、但頭寸頗感充斥、步跌二十五元、金號出證券帮十兩、遜為五千七百五十元、迨十一時光景、金號忽起買意、且賴某金號繼續撈入、而賣戶已漸減少、遂重見回漲二十元、金號進銀號三十兩、為五千七百七十元、將近收盤時、買者　止活動、錢兌業復來吐塞、再又步小十五元、錢兌業吐予金號三十兩、為五千七百五十五元、收後買風復起、證券帮反出為進、頓抬起十元光景、午後銀號首來撈入、進同業二十兩、為五千七百七十五元、後以某銀號繼續搜羅、再又抬高五元、銀號進金號三十兩、為五千七百八十元、入後錢兌業及證券帮賣出、遂轉向下、步挫十元、證劵帮出金號三十兩、為五千七百七十元作晚收價、結果比上日軋小二十元、全天三十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金再小五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百八十五元、迨九時四十分掛小五元、此後無變化、計大同行改懸五百八十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣後市鬆懈</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、以游資紛向外股市塲集中、因是銀根愈緊、外幣購買力益薄、再加以英價格趨長關係、益使買戶裹足不前、英美金鎊致續跌五角、英金票市勢亦軟、美金票初做十六元五角二分、繼而步高至十六元五角半、後又退至十六元四角六分、午後更降至十六元四角四分、卒為十六元四角五分、比上週六計跌一角、香港票及法郞票坎拿大票等均有供給、市價甚疲、日金票初尙平穩、嗣忽供塞甚旺、晚市退為一元二角八分五厘、朝鮮票供給亦暢、晚市降為一元零一分、餘尙平穩、</p>
<h3>貼現大漲　高至一百十五元</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、飛漲突銳、每千元貼率竟飛出一百元大關外、上午由八十五元直做高至九十五元、近午一度回下至九十二元、下午現鈔籌碼奇枯、而求者益急、竟再飛高至最後為一百十五元、比上週六竟高三十一元有奇、錢業公會拆息早午兩市均仍掛二角未更云</p>
<h3>紗花　實需雖已清淡　紗市仍在看高</h3>
<p>紗市由盤旋而帶緊象、此因人心良好、對於紗價仍屬看高、所以美滙雖放升、黃余鬆動、紗市未受影響而獨挺、有人說因現貨抽空、根子較緊也、不過實需轉趨淡泊之途耳、現</p>
<p>紗晨開人氣尙好、喊價殊高、然買戶寥寥、二十支雙馬現貨價為一千三百八十五元、廠單價為一千三百七十元、此價一開接受者較稀、頃刻又見回下、同時客幫銷路不旺、跌去十餘元、但某某等視價低稍形收進幾十包、市盤又復回升至十餘元、雙馬廠單做至一千三百八十五元查半日間成交統計一千六百五十包、行情二十支雙馬廠單漲十元、昨有棉紗一千二百十件運杳港、四十五件運海口、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一·三〇香港一九〇</p>
<p>內地一〇天津一〇〇</p>
<p>統計一·六五一</p>
<h3>現印棉售價　高出定貨念餘元</h3>
<p>本棉交易異常清淡、因廠方無納胃、故人心平庸、加之印棉近來海外到貨源源而來、存底增加所以棉市殊覺軟化、賣價不得見升、而且帶疲、與紗市情形大不相同也、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>二餘美種　　〇·〇同行進二〇〇包　　三·　〇</p>
<p>平果爾　一九七·〇〇又　六〇〇件　一九八·〇〇</p>

<p>米特林　二九四·〇〇又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>北沙松花又有運來、昨日葡輪阿維瑪理號自青龍港來滬、裝來棉花八百三十一包、當由客家用汽車　去、出口今日有五百包運天津、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因大衆賣出而跌、後因華爾街之堅强、及一部份空頭抵補、結果收盤市况堅定、較之上日、近遠期俱漲四五磅音、印度昨日連同預測漲二羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、繼續活躍殊甚、各方俱以外棉運滬困難、故連日市上現貨殊　佾俐、且日來到貨　稀、五月中除印棉　小額之釗貨外、美棉幾無到貨、目前因紗價高昂、廠方仍開出一批棉紗、雖同時曾訂購外棉、但此項原棉　不能屆時到埠、故廠方頗為空虛、日來曾搜購市七現貨、故現貨　格、已高出定貨二十餘元、茲將昨日以美滙六元折合送廠價如　、</p>

<h3>疋頭　東疋堅昂　改頭換面東貨　仍有運往內地</h3>
<p>布市以月底將屇、銀根緊急、貨主以頭　　係、頗有貶價脫售、晨市廉額手貨、　出不窮、市氣殊形萎靡、成交寥寥、迨午後東疋節節上騰、同業及實需生意頓形活動、售盤亦跌後反漲、多數恢復週前收盤價、本街辦坯布·漂布·府綢等十餘萬疋、溫甬辦色布·色斜·細布·粗布等二百餘件、粵閩亦辦二百數十件、近聞改頭換面之東疋、印上國貨標記、運往內地者、為數仍不花少、是亦不可不防　、</p>
<p>東布晨市平穩、後市因北幫　辦細布、本街同業實　　盛、售　乃步步上升、結果細布　疋漲二元左右、嗶嘰每碼漲七分許、收盤十二磅龍頭細布現　單售開四十四元七角五分、下月份四十七元半、四君子元嗶嘰現盤在升至一元三角八分半、形勢堅挺、</p>
<p>疋頭出口、二十二日運香港七百二十五件、運海口五十五件、運海防五十四件、二十三日運烟台一百八十件、運天津二百三十　、</p>
<h3>嗶嘰疲俏互見</h3>
<p>嗶嘰趨勢不一、行情堅疲互見、白嗶嘰市貨缺乏、英製頭號每碼開售三十元、豐裕牌子喊沽二十三元、非西貨雙黃邊叫沽十六元二角半、次號十三元半、國貨德大頭號十六元、二號十四元、元常灰棕素色薄嗶嘰、實銷有限、　亦平平、但國產本廠貨前存頗豐、暗　多見疲滯、草黃草綠色　見好轉、大光明寅豐牌子齊批售十元零五角、達隆九元六角元藏棕灰顏色、平均每碼皆可便宜二角半模樣、中厚嗶嘰、因現在天氣已熱、兼其價昂、近多盛行藏靑華特呢及漢立蒙等、致無甚大上落、怡和五十五號仍批售十九元半、三十九號十六元半、昨日有毛冷五十五箱、運往海　、</p>
<h3>糧食　米居定局　十萬客秈傳將抵滬</h3>
<p>米市為假後初開、賣買變方趙向、頓覺把持不定、進出兩難、故晨間悉抱觀望、後浮囤散戶、轉謀脫手、大事回　缺乏受主、小絞初尙堅持四十三元出零、至　一路下游、祇　四十二元三五角、較之前市收盤價四十三元、已落五七角不一、徘徊許久、及各方方方採購、一動即昂、各貨行情、再度　復原盤、遂以平平局面結束全市、</p>
<p>粳糯米來源、粳米已轉稀、祇蘇同　五六車、數計六七百包、糯米則由江陰轉到者頗夥、不下一千四五百包、銷塲粳貨仍僅塲外暗盤、聞做開不多、貶短四五角、無錫持粳四十六元、常州白　四十四五元、其他中市之蘇崑粳、高自四十四五元低至四十三元左右、靑泗薄稻特自四十五元决至四十三元、南港早晚稻四十二三元、糯米仍有客戶囤收、而糕舖飯担去路亦不弱、故雖貨旺、尙無十分影響、售價呈定降不　之局面、若溧陽眞特元猶為四十一元、特四十元零五角、四十元、他如丹常貨大都在三十八九元之間、僅决貨開三十七元半、昨日市上又有囂傳若京蕪及江北等尖、不日將有十萬包抵埠之說、第不識此訊屬實否、倘或確有其事、則米價頗有回低希</p>
<p>洋米到存　湧、終不脫盤軟局勢、貨方雖又新定不划、意圖堅持、但實銷不振、而業外投機囤戶又移神於別種商品、因此擯守之局面終被浮戶獲利出籠所衝破、惟浮戶出數不多、現米上午祗小二三角、午後續小角許而巳、期貨多空陣容、漸見掉整、空方大部為原根行號、而多方則為北帮與大戶、雙方勢均力敵、市面轉入擯局、惟尙有十分之二三乃屬於一般浮戶、故四五月份二號西貢早市站住五十四元半原盤、一至下午即被浮多獲利出籠所抑低、收價五十四元三角半較小角半、又即交五十二元半、即交二號暹羅五十二元二角、統市開回籠原包的三百　、現貨約七千包、</p>
<p>到滬洋米前日（二十一日）怡和洋行明生輪自香港抵埠、運來洋米七千九百五十一包、停靠羅斯福碼頭、昨晨開始起卸上棧、近日有大宗洋米苞米北運、今日太古公司新北京輪出口、山滬運津洋米七百包、洋苞米六千餘包、父洋苞米二千包運往烟台、（祖）</p>
<h3>煤炭　木炭旺到　價已回落</h3>
<p>木炭市面呆滯、各　售盤、殊難劃一、蓋以淪陷區如沈家門　海等處、均有大批辦到、以致散戶過多、進戶氣餧、市面混沌、計做溫州甲種木炭、每担八元三四角、海門人簍炭六元兩角、黃岩平　炭、每担五元六七角、較上月已見回　云、</p>
<h3>油餅　油市稍挫</h3>
<p>昨日生豆油較上週末、一致稍挫、豆油因到頭不絕、銷塲又平、近祇行囤略動、故市氣少發展、生油香　幫胃勢亦轉懈、昨祗採去二千五百聽、江北本坊生油、（價為一百　元）、故市態看鬆、其他本街行囤成去膠州生油四百件、七十七元、靑島生油二十桶、一百零七元、烟臺生油一千聽、一百元、豆油做開大連油一百五十桶、一百零六元、蚌埠油二十桶、一百零二元、靑歧油一百件、七十五元，烟歧油四百件、七十六元、膠州油二百件、七十四元、大有廠油一百担、七十五元五角、二十二日有生仁一千三百三十五包運香港、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲市一振</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、橫濱現貨一四七〇元、漲三十元、近期一四八〇元、漲三十一元、遠期一五〇八元、漲二十八元、本埠人心頗為一振、除白廠經外、昨怡和信孚達昌吸購輯里經九〇担、中干二〇担、售盤較前跌去近十元、市氣尙無鬆弛象、惟美銷仍在呆滯中、</p>
<p>昨日有湖絲五百包運歐洲、二十四件運蘇彝士、絲頭二百零九件運歐洲、又有香港運來人造絲四十箱、</p>
<h3>茶葉進出兩旺</h3>
<p>近數日來、內地毛茶來源、頗形湧旺、屬於內銷者、溫州運來龍井旗槍新茶共有八百餘包、陳貨一千二百餘包、寗波方面亦有毛茶二千餘包裝到、連原有市上存貨、統計不下二萬包之鉅、至洋莊銷路依然呆滯，昨市僅永興保昌等行買進中莊珍眉八十餘箱、售價自二百十元至二百二十五元、市盤又跌十餘元、</p>

<h3>滇省出銅考（二）</h3>
<p>管子曰：「地之東西，二萬八千里，南北二萬六千萬。其出水者八千里，受水者八千里。出銅之山四白六十七，出鐵之山三千六百九。」貨殖傳曰：「銅鐵則千里，往往山出棋置。」索隱曰：「言如置棋子，往往有一之。」魏書食貨志：「尙書崔先奏恒農群銅靑谷，有銅礦，計一斗得銅五兩四銖。葺池谷礦，一斗得銅八兩。南靑州苑燭山，齊州商山，並是往昔銅官舊跡。」即此以推滇銅，所採雖有多寡之殊，而山谷峻深，礦苗蘊蓄，諒與載籍听記，無或懸殊也。惟開採之法，皆須戽水；蓋金爲水母，五金所產，水即瀦爲，故辦銅例有洩水之經費，銀礦亦然。夏秋之間，礦穴水多，備難宣洩，因而停止，蓋恐傷其礦也。然此亦惟就秦西機器未行於中國時言之耳。覓礦先求山形豐厚，地脈堅結，草皮　盛，引苗透露，果然確有把握，然後按章辦理，可無耗折之虞。就滇省言之，凡有礦之山，其附近岡阜，必露引苗，逐决搜尋，遇有正苗，叫礦形漸成片塊，滇人謂之刷槽，由是攻硐，其寬廣者，則爲之堂，由成刷而成堂，始爲旺廠。若土石夾雜，則謂之鬆荒，旋開旋廢，易虧工本，甚至下開上壓，則人命堪虞，非獨資財歸之爲有，而訟獄目將滋生矣，滇人謂蓋被，蓋頁如被之覆，蒙頭蓋面，不復能見大日也。</p>

<h3>戰爭藝術家</h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>希多爾澄堡博士（Dr．Stoltzenberg）是一個近代的歐洲怪傑！眞的，從外表上看去，希多爾澄堡博士是一個尊貴的科學家：高個子，瘦身材，善良，穩重，溫和的藍眼珠。一切表示他是一個古式的學者。他的這種風度，「吿訴他為了純科學有了一個殉道者的精神：沒有虛偽，因辛苦與勤學而憔悴。他曾經說過：「人不應該忘記純科學的偉大價値，以及對於全人類的不可估計的利益。</p>
<p>他有一所偉大的實騐室在漢堡，他希望在這裏面靜靜地硏究他的「純科學」。</p>
<p>他的工廠裹有着許多工人，倚着奇妙的機器，在他的命令下，製造毒瓦斯。</p>
<p>有一次他的工廠因製造不愼毒瓦斯外洩，瀰漫了大部分的漢堡，數千人受毒，數白工人喪生。事後，博士說：「道决肇禍實可扼腕，沒有人能像我那樣同情於死者——但這是一個不可避免的代價，我們應付給純科學的硏究。」博士太熱心於他的「純科學」了。所以，除了漢堡的工廠外，博士還在馬德里以及別國秘密地方設了無數同類的工廠。</p>
<p>在上次歐戰裏，博士監製了大批毒瓦斯去殺死協約國的士兵。他是文化的毀滅者；他使婦孺啼哭；他强姦了科學。</p>
<p>希多爾澄堡博士是戰爭的癮者，他最近又作了許多驚人的發明，想使戰爭變成更可愛可親。</p>
<p>他發明了「蝴蝶」防毒面具。根據博士的高見，人帶了防毒面具非常醜陋，對於婦女有損美觀，對於孩子非常不舒服。野蠻人赴戰時常文面塗身，但我們已是文明人，審美與衛生觀念最屬需要。博士於是仿在歡節的面具，製成一種『蝴蝶防毒面具』。士兵帶了威武而漂亮，女人帶了猶似穿花蝴蝶，孩子帶了柔軟適體。博士眞聰明，他要使殘酷的戰爭變成快樂的在歡節。人家有了這種美麗的防毒面具，便不去反對瓦斯戰，而博士就成為頭等的富翁。</p>
<p>第二件美化戰爭的「貢獻」是博士的「虹霧」。他把各種毒瓦斯混合起來成一種「霧」，因為毒瓦斯顏色很多，有靑的，黃的，綠的，如果加上別些顏色，一混合，不就是一條「虹」嗎？在「虹霧」下，成千成萬的兵士流冷汗，血管破裂，肺腐爛，發瘋，肉化成漿。這够美麗的了，但希多爾澄堡博士對這發明還未達最滿意的脚步，他希望使這「虹霧」一點沒有臭氣（說不定使牠芬芳馥郁），這樣才合「純科學」的理想。——天空裹散下五色繽紛的芳香撲鼻的「虹霧」，人在快樂中不知不覺地死去。天使樣死亡了，希多爾澄堡博士確是戰爭的「藝術家」。</p>
<p>如果演習起來，帶了「蝴蝶」防毒面具，「虹霧」下漫步，豈不是一出色的遊藝？博士創造了一種新文明——死的文明。博士，偉大的學者，他使人類愛奸死亡，因為他使戰爭變成游藝。</p>
<p>這表示人類的進步呢？還是退步？</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>犧牲者</h3>
<p>— 金川</p>
<p>我的祖母因為沒有讀書，犧牲了一世的尤明，她並非是沒有讀書的機會，可是這機會却給「迷信」犧牲掉了。她常常埋怨自己的命運，講述沒有讀書的遭遇。我的外祖家很是有錢的，祖母又是個獨生女，所以太外祖父很想把她敎育起來，變成一個有用的女子。於是便為她請了一個敎師。這件事在偏僻的鄕村，眞是了不得的大事了。村上人看了眼紅，於是把自己的兒子送米附學常時到也有十來個學生。可是　上半年，就鬧了笑話，我祖母是很聰明的很快的就能讀唐詩了，而這許多男生還依舊在唸着三字經。這事叫全村鬧得浮動起來，都說「女人不可讀書，女人讀書拔了男子的秀氣」。所以全村的人都聚着來，要强迫我的祖母輟學。當時做家長的人也無可奈何，祇得把先生退了不讀書，就此成了迷信的犧牲者，抱終身之恨！</p>
<p>現在這種現象富不會再存在了，但我寫這篇故事，是給孤島上一般有讀書的優越的環境的小姐們做個對照的，可知當時女子讀書的困難，而現在有書可安安穩穩的讀，有技術可學，就應該好好的努力奮鬭，成功一個對社會有貢獻的女人。</p>

<h3>兩個問題</h3>
<p>— 愛斯</p>
<p>法據現代作家莫羅（Andre，Manrcis）在其致靑年辭中，回答了兩個很重要的問題：</p>
<p>（一）生活敎給我們最有價値的敎訓是什麽？</p>
<p>（二）怎樣使一個靑年能在困難中保持常態？</p>
<p>他對於第一個問題的答覆說：『生活的藝術功用是在排除無用。和痛苦的經騐，而代之以純潔無私的美的欣賞。』他更從事實上舉出例證說：『逃避痛苦可從閱讀，音樂及其他創造的享樂上得到的。』對於人的感情上，他說：『離開傷害我們的人遠些，那末不快的記憶也就會逐漸减退。』其决，他對於人生所顯示的第二個敎訓說：『祇有極少數的人是十分惡劣的。一向過價溫柔家庭生活的靑年，初與生疏的外間接觸，必將驚奇於凶殘，自私，猜忌，因而以為凡他所遭遇的一定都是這種惡現象。其實他的悲觀，以為人類非常卑劣，並非亳無根據。但是等我們知人稍深，也就會覺得一般人是可以做到和善，可以做到溫柔，並且人人都有英雄氣概的。吾人至此方始察覺其隱匿於罪惡的甲胄中者，實在是對於人生的恐懼。平常最習見的，就是一切愚昧都山於盲目的知和行。英國著名散文作家藍姆（Charles　Lamb）有一天說：『我厭恨那個人。』當時有個旁聽者反對說：『可是你並不深知他呢。』藍姆說：『自然啊，我不曾深知他。』『你以為我會厭恨一個我所深知的人嗎？』所以生活給我們最寶貴的敎訓是對人性眞誠的信任，不管他後天所犯的罪惡，也不問他後天的瘋在。因為所有罪惡瘋在只是一種結果，並不是一個原因。』</p>
<p>關於第二個問題，莫羅以為我們的生命應該建築在一個堅固的基礎上，應該遵守嚴格的紀律。『假使能够全心信守宗敎生活的紀律，工作的紀律，以及各種遊戲的紀律，都是純潔有用的。此外，我們應求計劃的統一，工作的有恒。一個靑年常被各種無限的可能事工引誘着。其實每個靑年應該有所選擇決定。雖然，他歡喜交各種友人；歡喜無窮的遊歷；歡喜追求無涯的智識；歡喜從事各種事業；以及經騐每樣的愛情；但是人生必須有所限制；他必須有所選擇，祇有如此，他才能活得深入，充實。』</p>

<h3>要管閒事</h3>
<p>— 秋</p>
<p>孩子在路上，看見一個野小子在欺侮一羣小鴨，便打「抱不平」；結果給野小子拋擲了一臉汚泥，回到家裹，爹爹提了他的耳朶駡道：「誰叫你多管閒事！」</p>
<p>一個小學生，不忍他的小朋友受先生嚴重的賣罰，便請求先生寬恕他；可是先生瞪着眼道：「不要你多管閒事！」</p>
<p>大家自小受了「不許管閒事」的敎育，熟讀了「各人自掃鬥前雪，莫管他家瓦上霜」的「格言」，等到長大了，便摹仿着「獨善其身」的聖賢之所為。其上者，儼然自以為是「紳士」，是「長者」；其决者，也自覺是「仰不愧於天，俯不怍於人」的「良民」。</p>
<p>於是：黃包車上的「拋頂公」，電車上的「摸袋袋」，旁人只當牠是一齣「把戲」看，而絕對沒一個帮着捉「扒手」的人。弄堂裏的流氓「敲竹扛」，旁人只當牠是一塲辯論會，而從沒一個肯說句「公道話」的人。馬路上的巡捕追緝盜賊，旁人只向電桿木下躱，也決不會有一個挺身而出帮着兜捕的人。總之，每個旁人的腦海中，氾濫着一片「不許多管閒事」的巨浪：這巨浪，掀翻了「見義勇為」的一葉扁舟！</p>
<p>因此，社會上盡是些助長「罪惡」的人；而沒有扶植「正義」的人。那「罪惡」，便像春筍般的蓬勃滋長，無可遏止；而「正義」，却像秋草般的日漸凋零，「回春乏術」！</p>
<p>的確，如果你多管閒事，代抱不平，會惹起「罪惡者」的嫉恨而團結着來襲擊你；可是，為什麽社會上祇有「罪惡者」的集團，而沒有「正義人」的集團呢？</p>
<p>管閒事！管閒事！我希望「正義人」大家團結起來管閒事！莫袖手看那「罪惡」的滋長而讓「正義」淪亡！</p>
<h3>變色的魚</h3>
<p>— 惠</p>
<p>魚類大多能够適應周圍的環境而變換自己的體色。盲目的魚全身即呈灰白色，而永不能再變化。單盲一目的在盲目反對半面的身體上也呈灰白，而盲的半面仍能隨環境而變化。這是由於內分泌和神經作用的緣故。</p>

<h3>做上帝的兒子　（二）</h3>
<p>耶穌從未說過，我們的生命，是一曲長而甜密的歌，他明白生命是滿有艱苦的一個蜂窠。照他的意思，宗敎不是善人除去遭些艱苦，乃是給人以勇往應付艱苦的權能，使人從奮鬥上成為得　者。宗敎許不給你滿意，但是牠能給你權能。宗敎不給你預防危險的保障，但是牠能給你不怕應付危險的勇敢。耶穌所敎訓人的，和他自已所實行的永久價理是，宗敎永有足够勇敢者的一種權能，袖不但幫助人克服一切橫逆，並引導人在道德上得着進步，在精神得着勝利。在今日各方面的困難中，在我們個人的經騐上，在世事的競爭塲上，遭個時候，不是我們給耶穌的試驗以一個適宜的機會的時候嗎？我全心全意全力相信，宗敎能應付我們的需要，並能培養出這樣一種人格，使這紛亂中，　出意義和旨趣來。一許多人到他這裏來，他給他們權柄，使他們做上帝的兒子。」這是約輪福音的作者所記下的方法，這一句話暗示我們，人類的經騐，還有偉大的領域本曾達到。若人敢照此行，就不願彼此殘害，互相恨惡，乃要使自己並幫助他人都做天父的好兒子。我們今日急須應付這個問題，「你成什麽成」或說，「你欲做什麽人？」在美國羅得斯君的名著裏，有這麽一段話，一過了二十年或二十五年之後，你在路士遇着一個少時所認議的人，有的時候，使你異常震驚。你記得少時看見他，他的面容秀美，態度嫵媚，與他人不同。如今呢，形容枯槁，身體瘦削，因為他忽略了少時身體的煅煉。此外，他的思想變成什麽呢？還有一人在昔為你所欽佩，簡直可以說得是策動你向前努力的原動力，你每逢與他接觸，價熱血沸騰，思想警錢，決志要努力多讀，多想，多做有意義的事。有一種內在的力，在驅使着你向前，你知道自己趕他不上，但因他的原故，仍確實得了更大的進步。過了許多年，你遇着他，不禁自問道，一他的敏銳腦筋，和勇敢精神，現在成了什麽：」為何他似乎這樣平常？所思所說與他人一樣？他的態度，言語，表明出來，他放棄了把自已造就一價更優秀更眞實史偉大人格的奮鬥。（待續）　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒成功經過　－今天是她十一歲誕辰－</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>時間溜走得那麼快，秀蘭鄧波兒已十一歲了。她是在一九二九年四月二十三日誕生的；因此，今天就是她十一歲的誕辰。這裏，就把秀蘭鄧波兒的成功經過，寫一些在下面：</p>
<p>銀幕生活八年　三歲跨上銀慕，到今年十一歲，秀蘭鄧波兒的銀幕生活十足有八年之久，在這八年之中，她的確曾賺到不少的錢。開初上銀幕時，她每週祇賺二百五十元，可是不久就加到拍一部戲可得七萬五千元的代價。自五歲那年起，她走上鴻運，風頭一直出到現在，使世界上每一個角落裏的影迷，對她都留有印象</p>
<p>一個賢良母親　秀蘭鄧波兒在銀幕上面，天眞活潑，有這樣的演技，當然要歸功於她有着藝術的天才。但除了天才之外，我們還不得不歸功於她母親的管敎有方。鄧波兒夫人對於這個賺錢的女兒，什麽都留心着，愛護着，無論在身體方面，藝術方面，都不使她受到斵喪的。在一個賢良的母親加以適宜的管敎之下，秀蘭鄧波兒也就能直向成功之路走去。</p>
<p>公司特別優待　為了秀蘭鄧波兒，福斯影片公司也曾賺過不少錢，主要的一點，就在秀蘭鄧波兒主演的影片，成本輕，賣座盛。這原因，對於這位小明星，也就特別優待。晚上不拍戲，在拍戲時不超過合同上規定的時間，不但給予秀蘭鄧波兒的薪水是那麽厚，連得她的母親，每星期也有一百五十元的酬勞。</p>
<p>替身沒有發現　而今秀蘭鄧波兒十一歲了，童星期瞬息過去。今後她是否將繼續在銀幕上拍戲，便成了一個問題。有人說她將脫離銀慕了，也有人說她會繼續拍戲。不過無論如何，她近來在衰退了，拍的片子已沒有往年的賣座，是確然的事。所以日後她的命運如何，也就不能確說。好萊塢對於童星，正在不斷的發掘之中，可是秀蘭鄧波兒第二，這替身直到現在還沒有發現。可知童星而要求和秀蘭鄧波兒一樣的成功，也不是一件容易的事情呢！</p>

<p>宋雅海妮入美國籍　好萊塢溜冰紅星宋雅海妮，原籍本是挪威，最近忽決定入美國籍，據宋小姐自稱，這原因，是為從此可永遠再不怕德人了。但據熟識宋小姐的人說，她入籍美國是為避去美政府向外籍電影員征收種種捐稅，這理由或許是對的，因為宋小姐是個很省儉的姑娘啊！</p>
<p>影星兜售雪茄烟　在好萊塢可可俱樂部，最近由考爾鬥主持舉行一個盛大的跳舞會，所有的收人，悉歸救濟英法慈善事業之用。無數著名影星如茂娜洛埃。奧莉薇哈弗蘭。安娜蓓拉。曼兒奧白郞狄安娜實萍。等等，都穿了女招待的衣服，向舞客兜售雪茄烟，每盒價洋二十五美金，一瞬間，全被售罄。</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒將退休　童星秀蘭鄧波兒，再映一一片後，便將脫離影壇：回復普通女孩的生活，因爲她的黃金時代已經過去，秀蘭去後，碩果僅存的童星祗有金惠漱了，金小姐是以頑皮活躍見稱，不像秀蘭以天眞居長，不知觀衆能否接受讓金小姐登上秀蘭留下的童星寶座？</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Evolution of the Nordic War</h3>
<p>Since the development of German military forces into Northern Europe, Denmark has been controlled bloodlessly and the main ports of Norway have been occupied. If, as Napoleon said, "War is the control of seeking position," this statement still has its important significance in modern warfare. In the initial phase of the Nordic War, Germany has taken the lead. Germany took Oslo, Bergen, Bodo, and Narvik in one fell swoop, waiting at sea for the Anglo-French to attack, and pursuing the Norwegian army on land, directly approaching Dombås. The German military strategy at this stage is to make the Norwegian army have nowhere to stand before the Anglo-French forces can make contact with the Norwegian army, and then devote all their efforts to dealing with the Anglo-French forces coming from the sea. What the Anglo-French are anxious about is to quickly land from the sea to aid the Norwegian army before it is defeated, so that Germany is attacked from both sides, not only unable to control the entire territory of Norway, but also has no foothold. So far, Anglo-French troops have landed at Sols and Djurs in northern Trondheim; according to Anglo-French sources, they have made contact with Norwegian troops and recovered Hamar. This is the initial success of the Anglo-French landing, which is certainly not enough to measure the victory or defeat of the overall situation; and the battle between the two sides will inevitably become more intense; therefore, future war reports from Norway deserve to be watched. However, the possible evolution of the Nordic situation is not limited to military affairs.</p>
<p>Germany under the leadership of Hitler has two unique methods for winning battles: one is the "blitzkrieg tactic," using rapid military action to destroy small and weak countries; the other is the "divide and conquer tactic," using political means to achieve the goal of winning without fighting. The blitzkrieg tactic is based on precise science, and the divide and conquer tactic is the legitimate inheritance of imperialism; since imperialism has always hunted for colonies, it often uses indigenous armies as its vanguard, causing them to kill each other, and then conquering them. The German military action in Norway cannot control a legal government as its tool like in Denmark, so it found a Quisling as a puppet to be used. Quisling's relationship with the German Nazi Party has been a matter of years ago. However, the Scandinavian countries not only have their deeply rooted nationalism, but also have long been baptized by democracy, which is fundamentally incompatible with German Nazism. The National Central Party organized by Quisling did have a period of expansion in 1933 when Hitler came to power, but later it declined for a long time because of its own divisions and the public's distrust. After Hitler invaded Norway, he wanted to put Quisling on the stage; and Quisling actually put on his official robes, and issued a so-called political program, which also put aside party politics, saying that it would organize a new parliament based on economic groups and cultural groups, and implement true democracy. This is transplanting the "vocational group politics" theory of the Nazi Party to Norway, so that its master behind the scenes can rule Norway. Unexpectedly, it could not attract an audience. The Norwegian military and civilians still unanimously support the legitimate government to fight Germany, and Foreign Minister Hesselberg in the puppet government also abandoned his post and fled. Recently, there has been news that the Quisling cabinet has resigned and the mayor of Oslo has organized an administrative committee to govern the new German-occupied area. This has proved that the blitzkrieg tactics used by Germany in Norway have encountered strong resistance halfway, and from then on, it has to engage in a broad and prolonged positional war; the divide and conquer tactics used are also not applicable to Norway, which has a strong national consciousness. Germany's attempt to control the entire territory of Norway has no hope of a quick victory, and no place for trickery. It can only use real knives and guns to fight against the Anglo-French-Norwegian alliance.</p>
<p>The entire occupation of Norway can not only provide Germany with military raw materials, but also put Sweden in a desperate situation militarily, and make it automatically throw itself into the arms of Germany. It is like throwing a stone at England, France, and Norway, and getting two birds with one stone, and having Sweden and Norway. Although Sweden has declared absolute neutrality, and Germany has also declared that it recognizes its neutrality, the scope of the war will not temporarily affect Sweden, but the spread of war is often not predetermined by reason. What's more, Germany regards blitzkrieg tactics and divide and conquer tactics as its successful masterpieces. Germany has something that it cannot help but do to Sweden, and Sweden has something that it cannot feel at ease with Germany. Judging from the internal situation in Sweden, although the authorities are working hard to strengthen its unified regime, there is more than one party in the country that is close to Nazism, such as the Swedish National Socialist Party, led by Frugaard, with the slogan of "Swedish Revival," and its party emblem is also the swastika; in 1933, it merged with the National Socialist Labor Party, and was led by Lindholm, who was recently arrested by the Swedish government. Another example is the National Socialist Party Group, led by Count Rosenborg, the brother of Ekström, the ex-wife of Goering. Although these many political groups do not have much power, they attempt to brew a coup, overthrow the government, seize power, and promote Sweden to throw itself under the banner of the German Nazi Party, which is an open secret; if there is no foreign aid to create opportunities for him, of course, he cannot have any achievements. Now that the flames have spread to Scandinavia, making Sweden threatened externally and latent traitors internally, then Quisling's ilk may not appear in Sweden. Himmler, the leader of the German secret police, once publicly said: "In future wars, we will not only have the army on the land front, the navy on the water, and the air force in the air, but we will also have the fourth force on the war stage—Germans inside." This kind of German divide and conquer tactic lurking inside was first seen in Austria, then in Czechoslovakia, third in Danzig, and fourth in Norway; from the point of view of civilization and morality, we wish that it would not be seen a fifth time, and would even disappear from humanity forever.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spokesman Again Claims Respect for Foreigners' Rights and Interests, No Understanding Reached Between the US and Japan on Maintaining the Status Quo of the Dutch East Indies</h3>
<p>Tokyo, when the Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman received reporters this morning, he gave a speech based on the Washington official telegram that detailed the meeting between Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi and US Secretary of State Hull, saying that the Japanese Ambassador to the United States and the US Secretary of State had not reached any understanding on maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, and it was not appropriate for Japan and the United States to reach such an understanding. The spokesman continued, when the US Secretary of State inquired the Japanese Ambassador about Japan's attitude towards China, the Japanese Ambassador told him that the Japanese government's intention was to fulfill its guarantee to all countries, maintain China's open door, and show ample respect to third countries in China. The Japanese government's policy of guaranteeing the rights and interests of third countries in China has not changed from beginning to end. The current situation is due to the fact that large-scale wars are still ongoing in China. He hoped that all third countries would be able to understand this environment. A reporter then asked, whether the Japanese Ambassador's meeting with the US Secretary of State resulted in the US and Japan holding the same view on maintaining the status quo of the Dutch East Indies. The spokesman replied, the Japanese Ambassador at the time had explained to the US Secretary of State Foreign Minister Arita's remarks made on the 1st of last week regarding the status quo of the Dutch East Indies, and the Japanese government's attitude towards this issue (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Hurricane and Rainstorms Hit the US Coast</h3>
<p>Boston, the coast of New England in the United States was suddenly hit by a hurricane today. More than a hundred houses were washed away by the sea, and many trees and utility poles were uprooted by the hurricane. The number of roofs blown down was countless. In addition, after the strong wind, torrential rain poured down, and some places suddenly became a swamp. The number of people and animals killed and injured must be considerable, but the exact number has not yet been found out (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>US Postmaster General Broadcasts Speech, Supporting the Current Policy</h3>
<p>Boston, Postmaster General Farley (one of the Democratic presidential candidates) gave a broadcast speech here last night, expressing his support for the current policy of the United States, which aims to avoid getting involved in the vortex of war, and praised the commercial policy promoted by Secretary of State Hull, advocating that the countries of the Western Hemisphere should cooperate with each other. He said, "The defense of the Western Hemisphere depends on the cooperation of the countries of the Western Hemisphere. As for the basic conditions for the security of the Americas, it lies in not allowing any foreign country to set foot in the New World. If the other parts of the world are always separated by the ocean, three thousand miles away, then the defense problem is very simple, but the United States must have a strong army and navy, so that it can come out and help when its neighbors in the Americas need assistance," (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Advocate Compromise with the Soviet Union, While Simultaneously Opposing Anti-American Rhetoric</h3>
<p>Tokyo, the newspapers here all claim that the Soviet Union will make new friendly gestures to Japan. Foreign observers attach great importance to this kind of argument, and say that after US Secretary of State Hull recently issued a statement on the issue of the Dutch East Indies, advocating maintaining the status quo and avoiding interfering in its internal affairs, the Japanese newspapers immediately took an anti-American tone, and at the same time, suddenly made this kind of speculation about the Soviet Union, which seems to coincide, so it can be seen that a new movement is about to occur in Japan, with progressive revolutionaries as the background, and promoting anti-Americanism as the main doctrine in domestic affairs. According to a diplomatic problem reporter of the Alliance News Agency sending news to Japan, the Soviet Union seems to have the sincerity to resolve various outstanding issues between the Soviet Union and Japan. Although the country still focuses on maintaining neutrality in the European war, it is actually assisting Germany, and is paying attention to the Balkans, the Near East, and India. Because of this, the country must maintain freedom of action in the Far East. Its urgent attempt to improve relations with Japan is probably for this reason. In addition, the Miyako Shimbun holds the same view, and argues that before accepting the Soviet Union's gift, the Japanese government should first carefully observe the Soviet Union's attitude to know whether it is based on sincerity. Although the Soviet Union's attitude has always lacked sincerity, it may not necessarily be the world's response to Japan. If the country can understand the Japanese government's true intention to establish a "New Order in East Asia" and can actively cooperate with Japan, Japan will not hesitate to shake hands with the Soviet Union. The Sino-Foreign Business News also carries that the Soviet government seems to have changed its Far East policy due to the increasing danger of the European war spreading to the Balkans. Under this situation, the country will naturally find it wise to maintain peace on the Siberian border. But the Soviet Union is capricious, and Japan's negotiations with the Soviet Union have never failed. The government authorities must not be negligent (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Vietnam Expands Military Preparations on a Large Scale</h3>
<p>Paris airmail, the French Vietnamese government is now carrying out a large-scale military expansion plan. Several ordnance factories and aircraft manufacturing plants have been completed and have already started work. There are thousands of natives working. This plan will be supported by French Colonial Minister Mantel. All the expenses are raised by the Vietnamese government itself, (Havas)</p>
<h3>Japanese Demands on the Philippines Arouse Anger of American Congressmen, Considering This a Trojan Horse Tactic of Japan, Hoping the US Government Will Ignore It</h3>
<p>Washington, Japan's demand to the United States for special status in the Philippines has aroused the anger of American congressmen today. It is reported that the Japanese Ambassador to Washington, Horinouchi, requested US Secretary of State Hull last Saturday to use the power of the United States to pressure the Philippine legislature to amend or even abolish the Japanese immigration law. Congressmen have strictly criticized this demand, condemning it as Japan's Trojan horse tactic. Senator Bob Reynolds and Congressman Martin Dies both expressed their opinions, hoping that the government would ignore Japan's demands. Reynolds said, "I don't see any reason why the government should interfere in the internal affairs of the Philippines." Dies said, "Judging from this demand, the Japanese seem to want to use the old trick of the Trojan horse. I very much agree with allowing the Filipinos to be independent in 1946, and at the same time, I think the government must not act on the orders of Japan. It must be known that once the bill is abolished, it is tantamount to putting the Philippine political situation on the path of hara-kiri." Officials here all believe that Hull will convey Japan's views on this issue to the Philippine government without adding any criticism from the United States, so that the Filipinos can decide their own best policy. The opinion of legal authorities here is that the immigration law does not have any strict divisions and does not violate the United States' treaty obligations. It is also reported that Ambassador Horinouchi has argued that in view of the Japanese people's contribution to the Philippines in economic and cultural aspects, the Philippine government should have allowed more Japanese citizens to immigrate to the Philippines (International News Agency dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo, Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro claimed today that US Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi Kensuke held a meeting yesterday, the theme of which was Japan's opposition to the Philippine authorities' recently passed immigration restrictions. "We feel that maintaining the average rate of Japanese immigration is essential for the continued development of Philippine agriculture. We do not want to interfere in the internal affairs of the Philippines, so we do not make a special request. We feel that the Philippine authorities' limiting the number of Japanese immigrants to 500 is too low, because Japanese women and children who move to the Philippines often return to Japan, which is enough to reduce the natural increase rate of the Japanese people in the Philippines." Suma ended by saying that after Hull and Horinouchi discussed the Philippine issue, Hull inquired Horinouchi about the situation in China. Horinouchi replied that the Japanese government always respects the interests of third countries in China (Associated Press dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Europeans Invest in the United States Under False Names, Totaling Over 10 Billion Yuan, Aiming to Prevent Being Seized</h3>
<p>The US Federal Reserve Board released statistics, which stated that Europeans' investments in the United States under other people's names are more than 10 billion yuan, probably because they fear that aggressors will invade their countries and seize their assets. The nationality of the investors is not easy to find out, but the official arena believes that a large part of them come from Germany and countries close to Germany (Reuters dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japan's Austerity Plan Not Approved by Military; Claims Readiness to Cope with World Situation; Current Military Expenditure Must Not Be Reduced</h3>
<p>Tokyo, an Asahi Shimbun report yesterday stated that the government had decided a few days ago, before the completion of the resource mobilization plan, to reduce the expenditures already approved by the Diet. The Ministry of Finance and the Army and Navy Ministries were allowed to begin negotiations, and the authorities of each ministry have already promised to economize. Regarding this matter, a military spokesperson denied it in a statement to the Nichinichi Shimbun, saying that as far as the army is concerned, there is absolutely no possibility of reducing the already approved expenditures for this fiscal year because the army's requested expenditures during the drafting of the budget were already at the "absolute minimum." The Nichinichi Shimbun then commented that if these expenditures are further reduced, it will have extremely unfavorable effects on the formulation of the army's budget for the next few years. "Although the China Incident has reached a new and advantageous stage for Japan, the evolution of the world situation may still lead to unexpected developments. For Japan's sake, we must be prepared to deal with them at any time. Therefore, the army's current expenditure must be maintained." (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Infant Mortality in Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo, due to the increasing infant mortality rate and declining birth rate in the country, the Ministry of Health and Welfare recently convened a meeting of the heads of health bureaus from various prefectures to discuss remedies. According to the 1938 statistics, the number of infant births nationwide decreased by 250,000 compared to 1937, while the mortality rate saw a sharp increase. When the Ministry of Health and Welfare implemented a preliminary infant health care plan last year, 2 million children underwent physical examinations, and the results were quite satisfactory. At this meeting, it was decided to allocate 860,000 yen for a large-scale infant health test, and the procedures are as follows: (1) The testing period will be from May to September this year. Infants born in 1939, aged two to fourteen months, must be examined by a doctor every three months. (2) The prefectural governors will appoint one doctor in each school district to conduct the examinations, totaling 20,000 doctors nationwide. (3) The prefectural governors must also assign 30,000 qualified midwives and nurses to assist doctors in the examination work, half of the expenses of which will be allocated by the national treasury. (4) Summon 100,000 infant care consultants to ask them to express their opinions on infant care and raising. (5) Request charitable workers across the country to work together to improve infant diets and provide free physical examinations. (Havas dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Horinouchi's Reception for News Reporters</h3>
<p>Peiping, Horinouchi, the Director-General of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated today when he hosted news reporters that the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin would not be lifted, which was a decision arbitrarily made by the Japanese army in Tianjin. This blockade was implemented due to strategic necessity. Before he left Tokyo, the negotiations between the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, had ended, so the Tianjin silver issue could be properly resolved in the near future. As for the progress of the negotiations between the Japanese side and the French authorities, he was unaware, but there was satisfactory progress. Horinouchi came to Peiping today to attend the North China Economic Conference. On Friday, he spoke with the Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin, Mutō; the Japanese Consul-General in Peiping, Shichida; the Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, Fujii; and other senior officials. Mutō returned to Tianjin on Saturday to resume his post. Horinouchi went to Tianjin yesterday and returned to Peiping that night. According to Japanese sources, the policy of the Japanese diplomatic authorities in Tianjin has been decided after these meetings. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo, the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Suma Yakichiro, recently told the press that the final resolution of the Tianjin silver issue may not be far off. Although the press generally believes that the final resolution can be achieved by the end of April, a definite date cannot be predicted. Actually, the Tianjin silver issue is not a major incident, but technically, it is quite complicated, so the resolution requires a long time. When the press asked whether the Tianjin silver issue and the blockade of the British and French concessions were two separate matters, Suma replied that the nature of these two matters is completely different.

<h3>British-Norwegian Allied Forces Recapture Hamar; British and French Forces Advance Towards Trondheim; German Aircraft Heavily Bomb Namsos</h3>
<p>Stockholm, the Evening News recently reported that the British Expeditionary Force and the Norwegian Army, in joint operations, have recaptured the city of Hamar. This news has been confirmed by the Norwegian Legation to Sweden. In addition, it is learned that there are no traces of German troops around Elverum, but this news has not yet been confirmed.

<p>Paris, according to French military sources, British and French forces continue to land in Norway without unexpected incidents or losses. The Norwegian Command and the Allied Staff now have complete and close cooperation. The Allied strategy is progressing very smoothly. The French military is currently optimistic about the final outcome of the Norwegian war. No changes have been reported in Narvik except for the German attempt to supply the trapped German troops by air. No news has been heard from the Trondheim area. After withdrawing from the flat areas around Hamar and Elverum, the Norwegian army is now holding mountainous areas, which can slightly reduce the effectiveness of the German military advantage. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Stockholm, according to unconfirmed news received here, British troops have retaken Hamar. According to Norwegian official sources, British troops carrying tanks and heavy artillery are said to have advanced separately by rail and road. General Weiss, the commander-in-chief of the German troops in the Trondheim area, is speeding up preparations to respond to the Allied forces' attack from the north and south. Half of the 70,000 residents of Trondheim have fled to the mountains outside the city. The German troops around Narvik are now essentially surrounded. German planes are often seen flying to Narvik in an endless stream. It is generally believed that the German planes are carrying food rather than soldiers because the German troops there are severely short of food. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Stockholm, correspondents stationed in Norway from various newspapers here recently telegraphed that German aircraft are bombing the south of Trondheim harbor all day long to prevent the advance of the Allied forces. In addition, more than 200 German soldiers landed by parachute near there, attempting to sabotage railway traffic, but more than 150 of them have been captured. Also, the Social Democratic newspaper is quite concerned about the repeated intrusions of German aircraft into Swedish airspace and said that the government should lodge a serious protest with the German authorities. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>

The first section of this line starts at Hamar, runs along Lake Mjøsa to Lillehammer, where British expeditionary forces are operating jointly with the Norwegian army. In addition, French expeditionary forces are stationed near Namsos, north of Trondheim. The Hegra Fortress is still held by Norwegian troops. Commander Holtermann was originally an officer of the Norwegian General Staff and studied advanced military science in Paris. (Havas)</p>
<p>German war report claims progress northwest</p>
<p>Berlin, regarding the German army's military actions in the past 24 hours, the headquarters issued a statement this afternoon stating that enemy warships again bombed Narvik yesterday, but there was no attempt to land troops in the German-occupied area. In the Trondheim area, German troops reached important strongholds of military action. No other important battles occurred. In the Bergen area, German troops captured a large number of new-style guns and other military supplies. Land traffic from Oslo to Stavanger is now open. In the Oslo area, German troops advanced north and northwest, defeating the Norwegian army and occupying Lillehammer, Gjøvik, and other places. The enemy suffered heavy losses. British troops attempted to land at Namsos and Åndalsnes, but were thwarted by the German Air Force. Railways and villages occupied by the enemy were destroyed. A British destroyer was hit, and two enemy cargo ships were sunk by German aircraft. The German Air Force also destroyed the enemy fighting north of Hamar and destroyed the enemy's rear railway. It is particularly gratifying that the German army discovered a gunpowder depot in Heidal, storing a large amount of ammunition. This move is of great benefit to the German army. Two enemy submarines were destroyed in Skagerrak and Kattegat. The Norwegian naval shipyard in Horten has begun operations. German aircraft continue to patrol the west coast of Norway and scout the northern North Sea. A British air raid on the Aalborg airfield resulted in three enemy aircraft being shot down, with no losses on the German side. No particularly important events occurred on the Western Front. German planes flew to France for reconnaissance and engaged enemy aircraft several times, shooting down two British and two French aircraft. Three German aircraft did not return to their bases, and one was forced to land in Switzerland due to running out of fuel. (Haitong dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>German Planes Heavily Bomb Three Norwegian Cities</p>
<p>Stockholm, a Havas correspondent telegraphed from central Norway that the Norwegian city of Namsos has been leveled by German aircraft. Steinkjer and Grong were also heavily bombed by German aircraft this morning. However, after the Allied forces landed south of Trondheim, disregarding the German aircraft bombing, they are advancing towards Levanger and Verdal, surrounding the German troops in Trondheim. In addition, when German planes bombed Snåsa, the Havas correspondent happened to arrive at the scene and witnessed the event, seeing three German Junkers planes dropping bombs, targeting the railway and the station, but they missed. According to the correspondent's impression, only the coastal area and the vicinity of the bays in Norway can be battlefields. The outcome of the war depends on the number of Allied and German troops. Now that German reinforcements cannot be transported by sea, and many German airfields in Norway have been destroyed, the United Kingdom and France have an obvious advantage.

<p>Allied Forces Achieve Significant Successes in Norway</p>
<p>London, The Times recently published an editorial, stating that the Allied forces have achieved significant successes in Norway, which clearly demonstrates the strength of the British and French naval forces. The conclusion is that the position we occupy is now more advantageous than two weeks ago. If there are other needs in the international situation, a portion of the naval forces can be used elsewhere. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>German Troops in Trondheim Gradually Becoming Isolated</p>
<p>London, a Reuters military correspondent stated that Trondheim is threatened by Allied forces from both the north and south. The German troops advancing from Oslo are clearly attempting to fight their way through to relieve the garrison isolated in Trondheim. The Norwegian army, using Kongsvinger and Elverum as bases, has been effectively hindering the German advance, and the time delayed by this is of great value to the Allied expeditionary force. At present, the position of the Allied forces not only prevents the German troops from Oslo from reaching Trondheim, but also isolates Trondheim and its bay. However, the above seems to be only one of the objectives of the Allied forces. According to Scandinavian news, British troops have landed at Åndalsnes, south of Trondheim, and are marching to meet the German troops on the east bank of Lake Mjøsa. This shows that the main destination may be Oslo. According to reliable news received in London today, the Norwegian army, whose morale was greatly depressed due to acts of treason in the army, has now fully recovered. Officers and soldiers are striving to perform their duties and are busy forming teams to resist the Germans. It is rumored that the German army would hardly be able to occupy Oslo without forging military orders. It is now reported that the Sigerness Battery on the coast of the Oslofjord is still held by Norwegian troops. The German troops near Elverum have so far failed to break through the line of defense based on Lake Mjøsa. Norwegians have been fighting in the form of guerrillas, often without officers and without military equipment. The British army has found that the Norwegian troops in all the areas they have contacted lack all equipment, but the morale of officers and soldiers is extremely high. From the current situation, it is becoming increasingly clear that the Germans did not initially anticipate that Norway would resist. We believe that the Germans would not rashly send troops to Narvik or use parachutes to land troops before gaining control of the sea. As for the British landing, the German side still does not seem to be fully aware of it. According to reliable news received in London, the British landing has been proceeding smoothly and without any losses. At present, the terrain of the suburbs where the Norwegian army is fighting is mountainous and extremely difficult, requiring small mechanized units. The only artillery that can be used is light mountain artillery. However, the Norwegian army is currently fighting very smoothly, and in some places, it has joined forces with the British army, especially in western Norway, where the two armies have made more contact, and the speed of this contact is quite unexpected. Rumors that Elverum and Hamar have been recovered have not been confirmed. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>British Military Gear Designed by Explorers</p>
<p>London, according to an announcement by the Minister of Supply, Herbert Burgin, today, the cold-weather equipment for the British troops in Norway was purchased from British and Canadian manufacturers within one month in absolute secrecy and distributed to various army depots within a few hours at the request of the General Staff. No army has ever been so well-equipped in such a short period of time. This is due to the efforts of manufacturers in the country and Canada. This equipment includes special clothing, snowshoes, boots, skis, Arctic tents, wood-burning stoves, and a large number of materials used by explorers. Sigurdur, the son of a famous Arctic explorer, and Smythe, who went to Mount Everest three times, both helped to jointly purchase the items. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Attacks Northern Denmark Airport Again; Incendiary Bombs Start Large Fires; This Place is a German Air Force Base</h3>
<p>London, British bombers attacked the German air force base in Aalborg, northern Denmark, last night again, dropping high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. The airfield was heavily damaged. Fires caused by the air raid are still burning in several places. One British plane is missing. According to responsible sources, the British air raid on Aalborg in northern Denmark on Saturday night came as a complete surprise to the Germans. This was the first raid by British planes on a Danish air base used by the Germans to conduct their Norwegian campaign. The British planes set off separately, and the first to arrive saw the night flight lights of the airfield illuminating the entire airfield. At that time, a large German military transport plane, with its flight lights on, was about to land when it was suddenly strafed by a British bomber with a machine gun and quickly fled into the clouds to avoid being shot down. The British plane then flew low over the airfield, dropping several high-explosive bombs and destroying a large hangar. Before long, other planes arrived one after another and carried out destructive work against ground defenses, but they were met with heavy anti-aircraft fire and machine-gun fire, and they attacked the airfield at various altitudes. After one low-altitude attack, three fires broke out at the airfield. Some British planes that attacked Stavanger on Saturday night also attacked quickly in single and rotating methods. Although they encountered anti-aircraft fire, all the attacking British planes returned safely to their bases. The British planes that attacked Kristiansand also encountered light anti-aircraft fire around the airfield. Anti-aircraft guns placed in the mountains around the airfield also fired fiercely at the British planes, but the British planes only broke one guide wire. It is said that when British planes attacked Aalborg last night, many explosive bombs hit ground targets, and incendiary bombs started six fires. All parts of the airfield are still burning. One pilot flew to a height of 100 feet from the ground and felt that most searchlights could not illuminate such a low altitude, so he was able to hit the road near the control tower with several bombs. A large squadron of long-range bombers attacked the Stavanger airfield. One plane launched a low-altitude attack with ten bombs, hitting fifteen enemy planes parked on the ground, destroying at least six of them, and the rest were likely to be heavily damaged. One plane flew low over the airfield, dropping bombs and causing several fires, while another strafed a line of enemy planes with a machine gun, setting two of them on fire.

<p>Rome: Yesterday was the anniversary of the founding of Italy and National Labor Day. Celebrations were held throughout the country. Ansaldo, the editor of "Telegrafo", gave a radio broadcast, elaborating on the significance of National Labor Day, stating that the Italian people should devote themselves to the work of nation-building for the country's future. The conquest of Abyssinia was a difficult task for Italy to gain living space. In terms of the current conflict, the interests of the state and the workers have become closely linked. The interests of the workers are based on Italy's military strength. From a military point of view, if Italy is a strong country, it will surely be victorious. In the future, the realization of the goals of Fascism, the pursuit of the happiness of workers and the nation, depends entirely on Italy's military weapons. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

<h3>European Diplomatic Situation Slightly Eases; Observations from British Political Circles</h3>
<p>London: Political figures here have stated that the current diplomatic situation has not only not worsened, but can be said to have eased slightly. There are three indications that can be taken into consideration: Many German "tourists" have successively entered Yugoslavia, and large numbers of German troops have concentrated near Hungary. The general public originally feared that Germany would take action in Southeastern Europe, but so far it has not done so. This is one. Although Italy's opposition to Britain and France has not completely disappeared, it has understood that Britain and France cannot be subdued by force. Britain and France also know that Italy is easily provoked. Therefore, speeches delivered by the British Minister of Economic Warfare, Cross, and the French Prime Minister, Reynaud, warned of the consequences of Italy's involvement in the vortex, while stating that Britain and France are not hostile to Italy and are willing to reach an agreement with it. This expression has been unanimously supported by public opinion in Britain and France. Although Italian Prime Minister Mussolini telegraphed German leader Hitler, expressing that "Germany's victory is assured," the British and French authorities do not regard this as Italy's response to Minister Cross and Prime Minister Reynaud, as Italy has not assisted Germany in the war with force. Therefore, this telegram is to perfunctorily please Germany. This is two. In addition, British-Soviet trade negotiations are about to reopen. This is three. Regarding this matter, although the future is not optimistic because the Soviet Union has stated that it is unwilling to reduce its export volume of certain goods, the British authorities have also published important statistics to prove that Britain has no intention of hindering Soviet trade, but only wants to prevent goods from passing through the Gulf of Bothnia to Germany. As for what Britain and the Soviet Union themselves need, they are very willing to exchange as much as possible. As such, Britain has expressed sincerity.

<p>Brussels: The Catholic newspaper "Le Soir" has reprinted the views of British newspapers, most of which say that British people believe that Belgium must still fulfill its "historical mission" in this war, becoming a battlefield of the European war. Wilkinson wrote in "The Tidings" that Belgium will once again become a battlefield of the European war. It is almost destiny. It seems superfluous to propose the question of whether Belgium can avoid it today. We believe that what should be discussed today is whether Belgium is willing to be occupied by Germany or by Britain. "Le Soir" commented, saying that the views of British writers are not what we are willing to accept. If Belgium encounters this traditional fate again, it will definitely fight to defend the country.

<h3>German Newspaper Comments on British and French Balkan Policy, Believes They Aim to Encircle Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin: Miguel, a foreign affairs correspondent for the Berlin "Financial Times", today wrote an article discussing the Allies' attempt to involve the Balkans in the war, stating: "Recently, the Balkans have become the target of Allied propaganda. From the Danube to the North Sea, rumors have spread, saying that the troops of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union will violate the peace of the Balkans. In fact, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union all want to maintain the peace of the Balkans." Regarding this matter, Miguel mentioned the conversations of Allied politicians on the Balkan issue. Prime Minister Chamberlain said, "The Allies will never treat neutral countries unfairly." Terfugu said, "The Balkan Peninsula does not need to immediately form a solid group to support the Allies in order to defeat Germany militarily. This is imperative and does not need to consult the Balkans themselves." According to a report from British reporter Bryce from the capital of Turkey, the British Foreign Office convened a meeting of ambassadors stationed in Turkey and Greece to discuss how to involve the Balkan countries in the war. Miguel pointed out that for a year, the Allies have automatically provided unnecessary guarantees to countries in Southeastern Europe and the Near East. The purpose is to complete the plan to encircle Germany. However, since the end of the wars in Poland and Finland, although the conflict in Northern Europe is still evolving, it shows the same principle, that the guarantees of Britain and France are insufficient to defend against Germany's blitzkrieg strategy. Today, the Balkan countries probably know that the best way to maintain peace and security is to stay out of the European war. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

The Second Paris Military Court sentenced communist Severt to two years of imprisonment and a fine of 5,000 francs for engaging in defeatist propaganda.

<p>London: The Secretary-General of the French Socialist Party, Fure, recently sent a letter to the British Labour Party, explaining the reasons for the French government's dissolution of the Communist Party, stating that the measures taken by our government are indeed very severe, but the Communist Party has become a spokesman for another government, and this government is currently assisting the country at war with France. Therefore, if the Communist Party is allowed to continue to exist, it can obey foreign countries, accept their subsidies, participate in the work of our country's parliament, especially various committees, and learn state secrets. How can this be tolerated? (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Not to be Drawn into War Vortex</h3>
<p>Sofia: Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov delivered a speech in Lovech in northern Bulgaria, declaring Bulgaria's policy of peace and neutrality to the representatives present. He stated that although the international situation has changed, there is no danger of Bulgaria being drawn into the war vortex. The Balkans as a whole do not seem to be tending to become a battlefield. Because several of the great powers have demonstrated their willingness to maintain peace in the Balkans, the Bulgarian people can work with peace of mind to seek the progress of national culture and material, so that national unity can become more consolidated.

<h3>Anglo-Soviet Trade Negotiations Favorable to Britain, Related to Economic Warfare</h3>
<p>London: Well-informed sources say that Foreign Secretary Halifax contacted Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky on Friday for trade negotiations. People here hope that the Soviet side will have a satisfactory response. This move by Britain is a concrete result of the recent consultations between the British Foreign Office and British ambassadors stationed in the Balkans. Diplomatic circles believe that this move by Britain is part of the overall policy of economic warfare against Germany. They claim that concluding a trade agreement with the Soviet Union has the same effect as concluding one with other neutral countries, ensuring that Soviet goods will no longer be transported to Germany. This is very obvious. Concluding a trade agreement with the Soviet Union will allow cooperation to prohibit contraband from being transported from the United States to Germany via Siberia. Therefore, this major loophole in the blockade can be filled. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavs Plan to Exchange Agricultural and Industrial Products</h3>
<p>Bucharest: A Yugoslav economic delegation, led by former Finance Minister Đorđević, is traveling to Moscow for economic negotiations with the Soviet government. They passed through Romania last night. According to a member of the delegation who spoke to a Havas reporter, "Our chief representative, Đorđević, will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. These negotiations are purely economic in nature. There are many agricultural and industrial products that can be exchanged between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia can sell pigs and tobacco to the Soviet Union in exchange for liquid fuel. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Spanish Interior Minister Delivers Speech</h3>

<h3>Swiss Army Expresses Willingness to Sacrifice; General Guisan's Speech</h3>
<p>Bern: A gathering was recently held here to raise funds for the Red Cross. General Guisan, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, attended and delivered a speech, stating that as of today, the term neutrality is being interpreted in various ways by various parties. We believe that in order to maintain neutrality, we must unite and strengthen ourselves, with the people and the army becoming one. Our current crisis boils down to three points: First, those from abroad should be set aside for the time being. Second, those from within the country, some foreigners are engaging in sabotage in our country, conducting propaganda and spreading rumors. We should not tolerate such actions. Third, some Swiss citizens often fail to understand the seriousness of the situation and the need to accept sacrifice. In short, we are determined to be our own masters. To achieve this goal, no sacrifice is too great. (Havas dispatch of the 21st)</p>

<h3>German White Paper - Item 12</h3>
<p>Berlin – The German Foreign Ministry last night released the twelfth Polish document, a report from Polish Ambassador to Britain, Raczyński, to the Polish Foreign Minister on March 29, 1939. The report contains three points: (1) the British government's attitude towards the European crisis, (2) its relationship with Poland, and (3) Raczyński's conversation with the US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy. The original text is translated as follows:</p>
<p>"Since the Czechoslovakian incident, British public opinion and the government have undergone great changes, believing that Britain needs strong measures and can no longer tolerate it. However, general appeasers, such as Sir John Simon, all advocate that Britain should take the protection of imperial interests as the premise. Britain can withdraw from Central Europe, Eastern Europe, and the scope of German development without any loss. These people also hope that friction will occur between Germany and the Soviet Union, and that Germany will encounter difficulties in occupying Czechoslovakia, so that even if Britain and France withdraw from Eastern and Central Europe, Germany will not be able to rest easy. These appeasers advocate restricting the scope of British interests and also advocate signing a joint declaration between Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland. Regarding this matter, the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union is noteworthy. When the British Overseas Trade Minister, Hudson, visited Warsaw, I made a detailed report stating that the British side was extremely willing to increase the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union politically. However, the Soviet Union does not seem enthusiastic. Moscow has attached conditions to the signing of a joint declaration, but the content has not yet been announced. However, it is known that among the conditions put forward by the Soviet Union is the inclusion of Poland as a condition for signing the declaration (Note: This matter was learned by me in the Foreign Ministry, but the Soviet Union denied it). In any case, the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union is not as close as it was when Britain first initiated it. When French President Lebrun visited London, I met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky several times at the reception. He expressed great satisfaction with the recent developments and also saw the recent truth about the relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>On the 28th of this month, I held talks with the US Ambassador to Britain, Kennedy. In accordance with Your Excellency's instructions, I have reported the results of the talks to Director Lubienski, who will forward them to Your Excellency. I asked Kennedy whether the content of his recent talks with Prime Minister Chamberlain on the Polish issue could be revealed to me. Kennedy denied it solemnly, saying that he had not held talks of that nature. At the same time, he expressed surprise at the public discussion of this issue by the US Ambassador to France, Bullitt. Then I asked for his opinion on British military action. Kennedy's answer has been reported by me in detail above. According to Kennedy, if Poland is determined to resist Germany in order to defend Danzig, Britain will inevitably be drawn into the whirlpool. However, whether Poland will be determined to fight Germany for Danzig is something that people here dare not make a rash judgment on. When I mentioned the Soviet Union issue, Kennedy remained silent, unwilling to discuss it much, only hoping that Britain's willingness to cooperate with Poland was more enthusiastic than with the Soviet Union (This opinion is also expressed in today's London newspapers). The above is the expression of Ambassador Kennedy. In addition, London news circles widely report that Kennedy once expressed to the British government that if Britain can support the small countries threatened by Germany, the United States will express great sympathy for it.

<h3>The Photographic Departments of Four Japanese Newspapers Merged with the Domei News Agency to Form a News Film Company</h3>
<p>Tokyo – The four Japanese newspapers, Asahi Shimbun, Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, and Yomiuri Shimbun, and the news photography department of the Domei News Agency have always competed fiercely. Yesterday, they implemented a merger to form the Japan News Film Company to seek joint development abroad. The position of president has also been recommended to be taken by Kuno Inosuke, the president of Domei. The International Cultural Relations Association believes that the news film business is a powerful weapon for publicizing Japanese culture to the world and will also send personnel to participate in it.

<h3>Two US Envoys to the Far East Hold Important Consultations in Japan - Commissioner to the Philippines Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Immediately Went to Tokyo - To Discuss with Grew How to Deal with the Future Situation - US Determined to Maintain the Status Quo</h3>
<p>US Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, arrived in Shanghai on the US Asiatic Fleet flagship, the USS Augusta, at 11:00 AM yesterday. The ship was anchored at the naval pontoon in the Huangpu River. US officials in Shanghai went to greet him. It was also reported that the ship ran aground in the southern Philippines on the 23rd of last month, so the US naval personnel in Shanghai, upon hearing the news of the ship's arrival, waited at the dock yesterday morning to learn about the recent situation of their loved ones, making the situation even more lively and tense. Here is a record of Sayre's conversation and other situations:</p>
<p>How to Deal with Drastic Changes in the Situation</p>
<p>According to Sayre, he told a reporter from the Great China News Agency that his trip was to Japan to visit US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, to discuss how to deal with various issues that have arisen after the recent drastic changes in the international situation. The purpose of this trip is to enable the US government and its foreign envoys to maintain closer contact in order to cope with future drastic changes in the situation. However, Sayre denied that this trip would involve discussions with Japan on the Dutch East Indies issue. He said that when he decided to depart, the Dutch East Indies issue had not yet arisen at all. However, he did not deny that this trip might involve discussions with Ambassador Grew in Japan on the general situation in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Pacific Should Maintain the Status Quo</p>
<p>He said that the general opinion in the United States at present is that it is necessary to maintain the original status quo in the Pacific. He also launched a major attack on countries with a policy of military force, believing that such aggressive behavior is sufficient to destroy thousands of years of human culture that has been painstakingly built up. The US national policy is to maintain these painstakingly built-up crystallization products through humanitarian and legal means. He believes that if the status quo is changed, chaos will follow.</p>
<p>The US and the Philippines are on the Same Page</p>
<p>Regarding the observations of various circles in the Philippines on the Dutch East Indies issue, he said that the Philippines currently has many internal problems, so the attention of the Filipino people is focused on these issues. As for the future situation, it is extremely difficult for us to predict. However, we can assert that the former Philippines and the United States adopt the same view, which is to maintain the balance of power in the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Independence Issue Still Needs to be Considered</p>
<p>When talking about the Philippine independence issue, Sayre said that Philippine independence still awaits the formal approval of the US Senate and House of Representatives. However, he believes that unless there is a major change in the world situation in the next four years, the Philippine independence issue will definitely be realized. But "in any case, it is still difficult for us to predict this issue at present, because this issue still needs to be carefully considered by the US government authorities."</p>
<p>A Short Stay in Shanghai and a Scheduled Trip to Japan</p>
<p>Finally, he also stated that the United States does not currently want to control a larger area. The reason why the US government has been slow to grant the Philippines independence is simply to enable it to gain more autonomy. Sayre is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan on the 28th of this month and is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel and has set up an office at the consulate. He hopes to return to Manila on May 22nd.</p>
<p>The Flagship Has Been Repaired After Running Aground</p>
<p>According to the ship's crew, the ship ran aground at Corong Bay in the southern Philippines. The area there is very narrow, but there has never been any news of reefs in the port. When the ship slowly sailed to the area at dusk to dock, it unfortunately ran aground. Although the hull was not damaged, the propeller was bent, and the rudder was severely damaged, with several ruptures, making it impossible to navigate. Therefore, repair work was carried out. However, due to the small number of workers, it took a lot of time, forcing the ship to remain in Manila for a week.</p>
<h3>Japanese Spokesperson Claims that Abe Has Arrived in Nanjing - Passed Through Shanghai on the Kashima Maru Without Stopping</h3>
<p>A spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at a press conference yesterday that Abe Nobuyuki departed from Kobe on the 18th, passed through Shanghai on the 21st without stopping, and has now safely arrived in Nanjing. The spokesperson said that Abe is a special envoy of the Japanese government, and it seems too early to call him an ambassador. Tokyo is currently eager for the "Wang Jingwei government" to be recognized by various countries. Only after recognition can Abe be called an ambassador.</p>
<p>Passed Through Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>General Abe Nobuyuki and his party arrived in Shanghai on the Kashima Maru the day before yesterday. Some say that the Kashima Maru entered the Wusongkou at 6:00 AM, and the Japanese side immediately sent a special boat to the center of the river to welcome Abe ashore. Others say that Abe landed at the Huishan Wharf at 3:00 PM under strict guard. Due to the Japanese side's strict secrecy, Japanese news agencies and newspapers were prohibited from publishing yesterday and the day before yesterday, so it is impossible to verify. However, the New Shenbao editorial yesterday revealed the news, saying that Abe arrived in Shanghai at dawn.</p>
<p>The So-Called Mission</p>
<p>According to news from the Japanese side, after Abe goes to Nanjing, he will begin to review the treaty on the "peace plan" based on the three principles of Konoe that the Chinese government and people oppose. He plans to turn the established facts into conditions, and then turn the conditions into laws. Then Japan can use this condition to annex Manchuria and Mongolia, block Central China, and control South China, from the Heilongjiang River in the north to Hainan Island in the south, up to the sky's weather, down to the underground mineral deposits, and in the middle from east to northwest, from territorial waters to inland rivers, all occupied and controlled, completely excluding the rights and interests of third countries and expelling third countries from the Far East. It can be seen that Abe's trip is of great importance.</p>
<h3>The Income Tax Office Encourages Informants - 1% as Reward</h3>
<p>The excessive profit tax during the emergency period has been levied since January 1, 1939. This excessive profit tax is an excellent wartime tax system. After the levy, it will increase tax revenue and enrich war expenses, which is still its decision. Its important significance lies in realizing the principle of saving the country by having money contribute money and balancing the burden on society. All industries have uniformly complied. Now, the Income Tax Office has reported that a small number of merchants have forged books or reported excessive expenses in an attempt to reduce the tax amount. Therefore, five regulations for rewarding informants have been formulated. If a taxpayer has illegal intentions to reduce the amount of tax payable, someone who informs will be rewarded with 10% of the tax payment. This bonus can be applied for by the informant to the local office after the tax payment is paid.</p>
<h3>Lockhart to Succeed as US Consul General in Shanghai - Currently Still in Peiping and Will Return Home - Scheduled to Arrive in Shanghai from the US in Early September to Take Office</h3>
<p>Since Gauss resigned from the post of US Consul General in Shanghai, his duties have been temporarily handled by the administrative consul. It is now learned that Washington has decided to appoint Lockhart, Counselor of the Embassy in Peiping, to succeed Gauss as US Consul General in Shanghai. Lockhart is currently still in Peiping, but it is said that</p>
<p>Before Taking Office</p>
<p>He will return home for a trip. He is scheduled to go to Kobe from Peiping first, and then take the President Coolidge to the United States on the 16th of next month to meet with the authorities for instructions, make a small stay, and then take the President Coolidge to Shanghai again in early September to take office. He is still a Counselor of the US Embassy. Lockhart has served as US Consul General in China several times and is very familiar with</p>
<p>China Situation</p>
<p>He is very familiar with the situation in China, and his transfer to Shanghai this time will definitely be welcomed by all circles in the city. He has served in US government agencies for more than 26 years. He came to China in 1920 and served as the US representative at the tariff conference held in Peiping. On April 15, 1925, he was appointed as the Consul General in Hankou. In 1931, he was appointed as the</p>
<p>Consul General in Tianjin</p>
<p>In 1935, he was appointed as Counselor of the US Embassy in Peiping and has been there for 20 years, achieving considerable labor. In September of last year, when Gauss left Shanghai for Manila, he briefly stayed in Shanghai and then returned to Peiping.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Remitted 500 Million Yuan Last Year</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese government encouraged overseas Chinese to remit money to their homeland, overseas Chinese compatriots in various places have enthusiastically remitted money. It is reported that the amount of money remitted by overseas Chinese in the United States last year exceeded the amount of the previous year. According to statistics released by the US Post Office, this remittance reached US$35 million last year, accounting for about 16% of China's trade deficit last year. This type of figure is encouraging to those who hear it. If calculated according to the Shanghai black market foreign exchange rate, one US dollar is equivalent to 16 yuan in national currency, then the total amount is 530 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Work at British United Shipyards Comes to a Standstill - Boat Hires—Also Go on Strike - More Than Double the Number of Striking Workers</h3>
<p>Since the British United Shipyards labor strike occurred, it has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. According to the workers' side yesterday, it is believed that in the near future, the scope of the labor strike will expand, and even any part of the company's work will come to a standstill. Since the end of last week, the kitchens and some assistants on the ships belonging to British United have also announced a strike, unanimously expressing sympathy for the shipyard workers, hoping that the company can understand the seriousness of the situation and find a way to mediate as soon as possible. Although it has not yet extended to Chinese employees in the Yangshupu Company, according to news from the workers' side, they are already uneasy and may join soon. However, the workers' side still hopes that the company authorities will hold negotiations and obtain a satisfactory solution. They also firmly deny that there is any background instigating this strike. What they are asking for is "how to adapt to the current living needs." This labor strike originated in the Yangshupu Yesson Shipyard, and then workers in various shipyards in Pudong joined, so that the number of striking workers has increased from 600 to 1,500.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Scientific Can Factory Will Endure and Resume Work - A Uniform Salary Increase of Four Yuan - Workers Submit Guarantees</h3>
<p>More than 150 workers at the Chinese-owned Scientific Iron Printing and Can Making Factory at 609 Route Tenant de la Tour, French Concession, requested that the employer improve their treatment due to the painful threat to their livelihoods, resulting in a go-slow. It has now been resolved, and the course of events is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Requests Unsuccessful</p>
<p>The Scientific Iron Printing and Can Making Factory is operated by Chinese businessmen and is large in scale. More than 150 workers in the factory felt that their wages were meager. In this autumn of continuously rising living costs, what they earned was not enough to maintain themselves. Therefore, on the 14th of this month, they submitted four requests for improved treatment to the factory director and engineers: (1) Wages below 30 yuan will be increased by 30%, and those below 20 yuan will be given more as appropriate. (2) Night work will be restored to six hours per shift. (3) Workers who are sick will be given meal allowances. (4) Year-end bonuses will be issued for one month. After the requests were submitted, the factory did not respond. On the 16th, the workers asked the Department of Political Affairs of the French Municipal Council to send someone to mediate, but it was still unsuccessful. The workers then began a go-slow on the afternoon of that day.</p>
<p>Employer's Conditions</p>
<p>On the 17th, the workers again asked the Department of Political Affairs to mediate, but they still failed to get the point. On the 18th, the factory posted a notice proposing three conditions: (1) Implement a contract system. (2) The number of workers to be hired must be determined based on the amount of work. Workers without work will still receive a monthly meal allowance of 11 yuan. (3) Wages will be determined based on work ability. The labor side felt that these conditions were too far apart and could not be accepted. On the 19th, the factory posted another notice, saying that the factory was operating at a loss. If the workers were willing to work, they should register before the 23rd. Those who were unwilling would be dismissed with one month's severance pay. All workers would receive a uniform salary increase of four yuan. The labor side, feeling that there was no way to appeal, went to register. On the 20th, the factory again proposed that the workers must submit guarantees before they could enter the factory to work. In order to take the overall situation into consideration, the labor side had to endure and accept it. Once all the guarantees are submitted to the factory, work can be resumed.</p>
<h3>Increase in Monthly Season Tickets for British Public Buses - Passengers Decreased by Two-Tenths - But Revenue Increased Instead</h3>
<p>A notice from the Public Bus Company of the International Settlement stated that due to rising prices, the company was forced to increase the prices of monthly season tickets from May 1, 1940, as follows: (1) Ordinary monthly season tickets: adults 24 yuan per month (originally 16 yuan), children 12 yuan per month (originally 8 yuan). (2) Special bus monthly season tickets: adults 38 yuan per month (originally 24 yuan). Ordinary monthly season tickets cannot be used on special express buses, while special monthly season tickets can be used on all buses. A reporter from Dagang News Agency inquired with the company yesterday. Since the increase in fares, the number of passengers has decreased by two-tenths, but the revenue from tickets has increased. Before the price increase, the total daily operating revenue was about 16,000 yuan, and after the price increase, it is about 18,000 yuan (excluding the revenue from monthly season tickets). The decrease in the number of people after the price increase is actually a phenomenon that should have occurred after each price increase. If one or two months pass, the original number of people can be restored. At that time, the daily revenue from tickets can be increased to about 23,000 to 24,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Women's Circles in the City Strive for National Assembly Delegate Seats</h3>
<p>The women's circles in the city believe that the National Assembly convened by the government on November 12th this year is approaching in a blink of an eye. In order to respond to the delegate quotas in various places, they have held many meetings to discuss. They all believe that the KMT party platform and the constitutional provisions this time stipulate that women are equal to men in law, politics, and society. However, the number of representatives often elected by women seems to be too small. Proposals concerning women themselves may be incomplete, and if there are not many female representatives in the council, they will also be neglected and rejected. It is necessary to send telegrams to the central government to appeal. Now the Shanghai Women's National Assembly Delegate Election Committee has issued a declaration to awaken the attention of the women's circles in the city. The general idea advocates that (1) the representatives legally elected above are not considered invalid except for those who defected to the enemy, and the seats that were canceled due to defection to the enemy should be filled by women as much as possible. (2) Shanghai is the national cultural center, and the number of talents is naturally more than in other places, so more convenience should be given.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Build Camps at Hongqiao Airport - Green Cloth Curtains Rise - War is Imminent</h3>
<p>The Japanese army carried out a large-scale massacre near Zhuzhai Town, and more than 100 villagers died. The town was fortunate not to be affected. The situation has been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to the English-language Great American Evening Post, the Japanese army in the Hongqiao area is now building barracks at the Hongqiao Airport, fearing the possibility of being attacked by guerrillas. Japanese soldiers have been stationed in the lookout posts. It is reported that the guerrillas in the suburbs of Shanghai have recently become active again.</p>
<p>Field Crops</p>
<p>Have grown tall, using them to conceal themselves, attack Japanese soldiers, and kill several. The Japanese army then carried out severe retaliation. "According to what has now been confirmed, on the morning of the 15th of this month, the Japanese army arrived at Zhuzhai Town, which is not a few miles away from Hongqiao Airport, accusing civilians of hiding guerrillas, and massacred no fewer than 400 civilians and burned 800 rafters of houses to vent their anger. However, there were no guerrillas in the town at that time. After the Japanese soldiers set the fire, they</p>
<p>Poured Kerosene</p>
<p>To make the fire more intense, and opened fire on the civilians who escaped. A few days ago, the Japanese army again set fire and massacred innocent people in a village in the suburbs of Shanghai. The wife of a certain sampan owner was hit by a stray bullet and was sent to the Shanghai General Hospital for treatment on the 19th and died of serious injuries on the 21st." etc. The exact situation in Zhuzhai is still unknown. Let's record it first and wait for proof.</p>
<h3>Returning the Railway is Just a Beautiful Fantasy - The Japanese Side Issued a Bill to Demand Huge Sums of Money - This Amount is Enough to Build Two New Railways</h3>
<p>According to foreign sources, before the establishment of the Nanjing "regime," it asked the Japanese side to return the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways. The Japanese side readily agreed, and then made a counter-request, listing a bill with detailed items, demanding huge sums of money before they would return the railway, including (A) the cost of transferring locomotives and passenger cars from the South Manchuria Railway, (B) the cost of repairing damaged tracks and bridges, and (C) road costs, including the salaries of puppet troops and life compensation costs. The exact total amount of these expenses has not yet been heard, but it is said that the amount is at least enough to rebuild the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways with some remaining. The rumored remarks of the "Minister of Railways" are even more depressed. He feels that there is no hope of recovering the two railways unless he can raise huge sums of money one day to rebuild the two railways, but this is just wishful thinking. It is learned that Chuan Shishuo once told his friends that what is under the jurisdiction of the "Ministry of Railways" he "presides over" is only a narrow-gauge railway three English miles long, which is the light railway from Xiaguan in Nanjing to the city.</p>

<h3>Famous American Writer Emory Observed the Trends of the European War - It is Not Impossible for the Battle Line to Extend Southward - Britain and France Have the Advantage in Economic Terms</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post stated that Dr. Emory, a famous American international and economic affairs writer, came to the Far East to conduct research and recently arrived in Shanghai. He spoke freely to reporters about the international situation, saying that the United States must now "pay close attention" to Europe and the Far East. The development of the European situation will inevitably have a strong impact on the Far East.</p>
<p>US Fleet Posture</p>
<p>However, the United States' maintaining a fleet in the Pacific is not a posture to deal with Japan. Its purpose is to maintain the status quo in the Pacific. Moreover, the US fleet has been stationed in the Pacific for several years. If it is transferred to the Atlantic, it will only increase the tension in the European situation. The outbreak of the war in the Scandinavian Peninsula is the beginning of the expansion of the European war front and may promote the early outbreak of the war in the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Trend of the Battle Line</p>
<p>Because after Germany invaded Denmark and Norway, the Allied countries may take action in the Balkan Peninsula and on the Turkish-Soviet border. Germany's motivation for invading Norway is to prevent the Allied countries from strengthening their control over the region. Sweden seems to have long had a plan to occupy Denmark and Norway, but it is waiting for the Allied countries to act first. In Denmark, Germany may be able to obtain some metals, but Norway does not have valuable raw materials, so the most important gain for Germany in this victory over Norway should be strategic benefits, that is, to ensure the transportation of Swedish iron sand and other necessary goods to Germany and to prevent the Allied countries from gaining an important position to strengthen their blockade.</p>
<p>The situation in Northern Europe</p>
<p>There is little hope that the war in Northern Europe will be localized, and Sweden is now in danger of being invaded and may not be able to avoid direct participation in the war. It is not impossible for the Allied countries to use troops against Romania to attack Germany and control the Romanian oil fields. At this point, war will also break out in the Balkan Peninsula, and the Soviet Union will supply oil to Germany. The Allied countries may decide to intercept it to strengthen the blockade against Germany. Then large-scale war will break out along the entire line from Northern Europe to the Near East, or even drag the Soviet Union into the war.</p>
<p>Judgment of Advantages and Disadvantages</p>
<p>In terms of economic warfare, Britain and France have a great advantage, as do the navies. The organization and training of the German army are excellent, but the talent of its supreme commander is probably inferior to that of the German army commander during the World War. Dr. Emory is scheduled to go to Nanjing today (the 22nd) and then return to the United States via the Philippines.</p>
<h3>China International Radio to Broadcast Special Programs Aimed at Entertaining Foreigners Beyond the Coastline - Two-Hour Broadcasts Every Sunday Evening - Many Former Shanghai Foreigners Also Participating</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that China International Radio, located in Sichuan with call sign XGOY, wavelength 25.21 meters, or 11900 kilocycles, has added a new two-hour program every Sunday evening called "Voice of China's Sunday Evening Program," aimed at entertaining foreigners beyond the Chinese coastline. In addition to musical programs, it includes short, special segments.</p>
<p>Shanghai Reception</p>
<p>The broadcast time is from 6:30 PM to 8:30 PM. Shanghai listeners are expected to find this special program particularly interesting, as several foreigners who previously resided in the city participate in the radio station's broadcasts on a regular weekly basis. For example, the American female writer, Miss Emily Hahn, broadcasts for fifteen minutes each time, reciting English translations of Chinese poetry accompanied by appropriate</p>
<p>Chinese Music</p>
<p>Mrs. Du Ting, Mrs. Bernfield, and Mrs. Graham broadcast for ten minutes, reporting on life in Chongqing through the eyes of foreigners in a chatty style. Mrs. Du Ting previously taught at the American School in Shanghai and has resided in China for a long time. Her husband is a correspondent for the New York Times. Mrs. Bernfield is currently responsible for the publicity of Chinese Industrial Cooperatives and previously worked as a correspondent for the United Press in Peiping for many years. Mrs. Graham currently works at China International Radio and previously served as a news editor for the English-language "China Press" weekly.</p>
<p>News Editor</p>
<p>Another special program is "Voice of China's Questions and Answers." This type of question program is extremely popular in the United States. Questions related to China that are of public concern can be addressed to the International Radio Station, and the station will answer them as quickly as possible in this program. In addition, musicians are invited weekly to perform ancient Chinese music and</p>
<p>Beautiful Songs</p>
<p>Including a solo performance of the Guqin on the 7th of this month and a solo performance of a Chinese lullaby by Ms. Hong on the 14th of this month.

<h3>Dredging Work to Begin Next Month</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese returned the dredgers of the Huangpu River to the Dredging Bureau, the various machines and surveying equipment have been awaiting repair, so the dredging work has not yet resumed. It is reported that the dredging work, under the supervision of the Japanese, will begin in mid-May.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Residents Sever Commercial Ties</h3>
<p>According to news from foreign residents in this city, since the expansion of the European war and the establishment of a state of war between Germany and Norway, German and Norwegian residents in this city have now ceased all commercial relations and broken off contact. The reporter confirmed this with the Norwegian Consulate General in Shanghai yesterday. According to the Norwegian Consul General, T. Knudtzon, "The severance of commercial relations between Norwegian residents in Shanghai and German residents is a voluntary act by the Norwegian residents, and the Norwegian Consulate has not issued any such order." It is estimated that there are about 700 to 800 German merchants and about 200 Norwegian merchants residing in Shanghai. It is also reported that when the Soviet-Finnish war broke out, the Japanese spread the news that the Soviet Union would restore its consulate in Shanghai, but until recently, the Soviet Union has not restored its consulate in Shanghai, nor is it prepared to do so. The reporter inquired about this matter at the Norwegian Consulate General in Shanghai, which stated that "Soviet citizens in Shanghai are still being represented by the Norwegian Consulate as usual. As for the previous statement that the Soviet Union would restore its consulate in Shanghai, nothing has been heard of it so far."</p>
<h3>Changes in the Economic Review Committee Membership - The Japanese Can No Longer Exploit It - Committee Members from Various Countries to be Elected by Residents</h3>
<p>At the annual meeting of foreign taxpayers of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 17th of this month, the Japanese proposed the establishment of an Economic Review Committee with ten members. However, after a vote by all foreign taxpayers, the result was that the ten members were changed to twelve and passed, namely two each from China, Britain, the United States, and Japan, and one each from Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands. According to this newly organized committee, its power is second only to the Board of Directors of the Municipal Council. Fortunately, the foreign taxpayers at the annual meeting modified and passed the Japanese proposal, making it impossible for them to exert any influence. According to a report from the reporter of the "Ping Ming News Agency" to the relevant departments of the Municipal Council, the members of the Economic Review Committee will be produced by the residents of various countries according to the number of seats, that is, two British and American members will be elected by the British and American Residents Associations, respectively. The Japanese members will be nominated by the Japanese Residents Group. In addition, one member each from Germany, France, Italy, and the Netherlands will also be nominated by the residents groups of each country. As for the two Chinese members, they will be nominated by the Chinese Taxpayers Association. Currently, various parties in China and abroad are separately nominating suitable individuals to serve as members. The Municipal Council will formally announce the list of names as soon as all the residents' groups have nominated their representatives.</p>
<h3>Goods to be Marked with Prices - All Industries Preparing - Sample Price Lists Distributed - Hoarding and Profiteering to be Severely Punished</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions announced that all shops and markets must mark the prices of goods for sale, all parties have hoped to see it implemented as soon as possible. It is now learned that all shops and markets are preparing after receiving the sample price lists, and are determined to follow the regulations of the authorities and act in unison. It is also heard that the industry associations have also decided to assist in the implementation of this matter, in order to make it universal. They believe that marking prices not only facilitates public selection and purchase, but also benefits the shops themselves. After all, price chaos only leads to the disappearance of social purchasing power, which results in reduced sales and stagnant funds for shops, which is equivalent to suffering losses. The authorities of the two concessions are now determined to do their utmost to suppress and stabilize prices. If merchants hoard and profiteer, or if non-merchants use speculative funds to stimulate prices, they will be strictly prosecuted and punished. It has been decided, in consultation with the courts, that the penalties of a few days' detention and fines in accordance with the police regulations are too light, and they will be punished in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the government for punishing unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>No Price Limits for Now</p>
<p>The French Concession Price Stabilization Committee and the Public Concession Price Control Committee, acting in parallel, have successively published average price lists of daily necessities by the Price Stabilization Committee and the Health Department on the 13th and 17th of this month. It has been decided in principle that the first step is to publish the prices of necessities for residents to refer to, and no price limits will be set for the time being. In the future, if residents encounter merchants who are not satisfied with reasonable profits, excessively raise prices, or resort to tricks and fraud, they can report them to the police for investigation and punishment.</p>
<p>French Consulate Announcement</p>
<p>The French Consul General's Order No. 158 reads as follows: "In order to enforce the law, in accordance with Article 2 of this Consulate's Order No. 78 of February 19, 1940, and the resolution of the meeting of the Price Stabilization Committee for Necessities of April 4, 1940, the following order is issued: Article 1: This order applies to all merchants who retail the items listed in the attached table. Article 2: These merchants shall post an abstract of the price list of daily necessities sold outside the shop or in a place easily visible on the road.

Article 3: All goods for sale, whether inside or outside the store, shall be affixed with a price tag indicating the price per retail unit (such as per kilogram, per piece, per dozen, per centimeter, etc.). The indicated price shall be in Arabic numerals, the size of which shall not be less than three centimeters. Article 4: Any first-time violation of this Consulate's order shall be given a warning; any subsequent violation shall be subject to a fine of one to five hundred yuan. After being punished by the Consul General's Office, the business license may also be revoked. Article 5: The warnings and punishments stipulated in the above article may be announced or published by the Consular Police Department. Article 6: The provisions of Articles 13 and 14 of this Consulate's Order No. 34 of January 29, 1940, shall apply to the price disclosure methods of this Consulate's order. Article 7: This Consulate now directs the Commissioner of Police to implement it. April 12, 1940, Consul General Baudais."</p>
<h3>Charity Broadcast for Zhongshan Refugees Ends</h3>
<p>The charity broadcast held by all circles in Shanghai at the Glass Radio Station of the New Capital Hotel ended last night. Famous actors, singers, famous courtesans, and entertainment artists all participated voluntarily. The number of requests for songs was very enthusiastic, and the fundraising results were very satisfactory. Yesterday, in addition to speeches by Mr. Chua Ek Khoon and Mr. Jin Tingsun, the conference also appointed Vice Chairman Li Ze to report on the recent disaster situation in Zhongshan and thank all sectors of society. It has been found that the disaster situation in Zhongshan is serious this time, and the need for funds is extremely urgent.

<h3>Nanshi Flower Association - Its Poison Spreads Deeper</h3>
<p>After the Nanshi Flower Association became popular, many people were immersed in it, and its impact was extremely harmful. Unexpectedly, a group of gamblers has recently intensified their efforts, secretly setting up gambling dens in shops, luring customers to gamble. Even women who go to buy groceries are enticed by the shop assistants to use the change to play the Flower Association, and countless people are deceived. This poison has recently spread to the refugee area. The person in charge of the area, Father Z, believes that the harm of the Flower Association is worse than floods and fierce beasts. Therefore, in addition to notifying the refugees in each shelter not to be tempted, he also warned the staff yesterday not to engage in this bad habit. If they do, they will be dismissed immediately. It is also heard that Z will firmly request a ban.</p>
<h3>"Roulette King" - Garcia Returns with a Vengeance - Concession Authorities Closely Monitoring</h3>
<p>According to news from foreigners, the gambling tycoon, Mexican Garcia, known as the "Roulette King," has recently come to Shanghai again, waiting for an opportunity to act. It has been found that Garcia opened a large-scale roulette gambling den at No. 151 Jing'an Temple Road in this city twelve years ago. The concession authorities cracked down on it on April 22, 1928. Garcia himself was arrested on June 19, 1929. Mr. Alermando, the acting Mexican consul at the time, who is now a director of the Municipal Council, revoked his consular jurisdiction and sent him to the Provisional Court for punishment. He was eventually sentenced to one year of imprisonment and detained in the Western Prison on Xiamen Road. After his release, he wandered to California, USA, and continued his old business, chartering a ship and mooring it on the beach, where he set up a gambling den. Later, it was cracked down on by the police authorities. Now that the Western District of Shanghai is full of smoke and gambling, Garcia has returned with a vengeance, hiding in Shanghai. It is heard that the authorities responsible for security are closely monitoring Garcia's whereabouts.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Fall - Prices of Firewood and Charcoal Also Decline</h3>
<p>The coal market in this city has seen a surge in prices due to speculators taking advantage of the Northern European war to raise prices wildly. Now that more than 100,000 tons of foreign coal have arrived in Shanghai in recent days, and hoarders are selling off their stocks, lump coal and coal dross have both fallen by five to ten yuan. However, the price of coal balls has risen to 7.4 yuan per dan, exceeding the price of 7 yuan per dan announced by the French Municipal Council, and there has been no change, causing an endless burden for users. It is heard that the price of firewood and charcoal has also fallen by 50 cents per dan.</p>
<h3>Female Corpse Found on Qiujiang Road</h3>
<p>At the corner of Beisichuan Road and Qiujiang Road in Hongkou, there is an archway decorated with colored streamers. A little to the north, on the wasteland on the side of the road, an unnamed dismembered female corpse was discovered at dawn yesterday morning. She appeared to be eighteen or nineteen years old, and her clothes were gorgeous. Both feet had been sawed off, her head was bloody and blurred, and her arms were broken, a truly horrific sight. A woman's leg wearing a high-heeled leather shoe and silk stockings, dripping with fresh blood, was found in front of the former site of the Commercial Press branch nearby. It seemed to be a limb of the young woman who was murdered on Qiujiang Road. For a time, many pedestrians gathered to watch. The corpse was obviously murdered by criminals and abandoned at that location.</p>

<h3>Exports from This City to the Dutch East Indies Have Returned to Normal - British and American Determination to Maintain the Status Quo Has Removed the Threat - Large Quantities of Domestic Goods Will Be Shipped to the Area</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Northern Europe, the Dutch East Indies has been threatened by the Japanese, and the Dutch currency has fallen sharply. As a result, the export industry in this city that deals with the Dutch East Indies has been uneasy. However, since Britain and the United States expressed their determination to maintain the status quo in the Dutch East Indies, the situation has greatly improved, and the value of the Dutch currency has also rebounded. The reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency interviewed an exporter dealing with the Dutch East Indies yesterday, who said that the threat to the Dutch East Indies has been lifted. Since Germany has not declared war on the Netherlands, Japan does not seem to be able to take any action against the Netherlands. Therefore, the export industry in this city that deals with the Dutch East Indies has returned to normal. Recently, a large number of domestic cotton fabrics and daily necessities will be shipped to the Dutch East Indies by the Java Liner.</p>

<h3>Securities - Reasons for the Big Rise in Wheelock Marden Shares - Domestic Debt Affected by Banking Factors</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market continued to fall sharply yesterday. All stocks were under pressure due to tight funds, and sellers continued to arrive. This shortage of money is due to very complex reasons. Bund banks are absorbing cash for interest arbitrage, and interest rates are increasing. Foreign stock prices have suddenly soared, requiring a large amount of cash, so the discount rate is high. Banks are rushing to collect money at the end of the month, and those going long are paying interest as high as 3%. Most of the above have prices but no market. The silk and tea business is gradually starting, requiring huge amounts of money, and banks must also prepare funds. Therefore, when applying for loans from banks, they are rejected except for a very few who have connections. Although this phenomenon is a temporary supply and demand relationship, it has deeply affected the government bond market and it will be difficult to activate it within this month. Although the market price has fallen quite a bit, it has not yet caused it to rise rapidly. Even if there is a recovery, it will be short and small. Yesterday was still spent in a gradual state of weakness. Although No. 38, Renchang, and Lianhe bought in the morning and afternoon, and others such as Tiansheng, Tongshun, Yongkang, Dafeng, and Hengfu Tongyu also bought in first, the selling pressure was still strong. For example, Shunkang and Lianyi continued to sell constantly, and a steady stream of spot goods continued to flow out from Hongda, Taifeng, Shuntai, Shengda, and Tongkang. Although the market price recovered slightly in the afternoon, the trend was still extremely weak and listless. At best, the future will see a temporary consolidation, and the rising trend is not yet the time. As a result, it continued to fall by 3 to 5.5 jiao, and the total number of transactions was 1.56 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Great China Match were traded at a price of 25.75 yuan.</p>
<p>The foreign stock market situation was strong and lively yesterday, beyond words, due to the weekend news, which was all favorable to the bulls. What Wheelock Marden shares encountered was especially glorious and extremely splendid. The company recently announced the issuance of new shares, coupled with external rumors that the Far East shipping costs will proportionally increase. Both of these are the main factors for its repeated surge. The highest price was 272 yuan, which caused those with rights to sell wildly. If the market situation is excellent, the decline should not be limited to a few yuan. National, Yangtsze, Jardine and other stocks are in great public demand. China Land Reclamation shares rose to 29 yuan, and were also outstanding. Rubber stocks had been neglected for several weeks and have recently bloomed like sturdy grass in a strong wind. Compared to the sharp rise of industrial stocks, the price of rubber stocks has recently been lower than it was a few weeks ago, which is illogical.</p>
<p>The capital of Wheelock Marden &amp; Company is set at 10 million taels of silver, divided into 1 million shares. The face value of the stock is 10 taels of silver, and the paid-up capital is 2,393,600 taels of silver, for a total of 239,360 shares. The company convened a board meeting last Saturday, April 20), and decided to continue issuing 239,360 new shares from the uncollected capital, to be subscribed equally by old shareholders, with one old share being able to purchase one new share. The issue price of the new shares is 25 yuan in national currency. All shareholders registered before May 4 of this month can apply for subscription. The deadline for subscription and payment of shares by shareholders in the Far East is May 24. The date from which the new shares will accrue interest is set to begin on April 1 of this year.</p>
<h3>Hutchison Rubber Shares Pay Dividends</h3>
<p>The 30th Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of Hutchison Rubber Limited, managed by Hutchison &amp; Company, will be held on May 3. The final dividend for 1939 is proposed to be 7.5 jiao in national currency, for a total of 1.75 yuan in national currency including the interim dividend.</p>
<h3>Finance - US Dollar Exchange Turns to Selling, Flowing Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listed rates. The unofficial British and American exchange rates continued to strengthen. This was because there were no new developments in the European situation and the exchange rate had already rebounded to its previous high. Market transactions were entirely concentrated on arbitrage and swaps. Today, Chinese merchants were willing to pay a premium of 2.5 cents for spot US dollars to sell May contracts. The swap difference between spot and May contracts required paying out 0.28125. At the opening this morning, gold was flat, and the US dollar was strong at 0.03125. Although speculators and outsiders with gains occasionally sold, the underlying trend remained quiet. It was only heard that the Tianjin exchange rate was weak. Speculators were reluctant to accept forward contracts for pounds sterling, while US dollars were still flowing out in a continuous stream. The afternoon situation was extremely quiet. The loosening trend for US dollars in the current month was most evident. Therefore, the closing prices for spot and May contracts were similar to the opening prices this morning, while the current month was hard at 0.03125.</p>
<p>Most Transactions Were Arbitrage</p>
<p>This morning, the exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai dollars, French francs, etc., were all flat. The US dollar was up two points against the British pound, unchanged against the Japanese yen, and up one point against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The opening selling prices for spot exchange rates at banks this morning were 4 shillings and 1.125 pence for British gold and 6.03125 yuan for US dollars. Compared to last Saturday, the British pound was flat and the US dollar was up 0.03125, due to the rebound in the exchange rate. At the same time, futures contracts also opened slightly lower. After the opening, the market still appeared strong, but trading was not very active. Chinese merchants continued to engage in arbitrage and swap transactions. It was heard that Chinese merchants were willing to pay a premium of 2.5 cents for spot US dollars to sell May futures, and a premium of 0.21875 for entering April and selling May. Furthermore, many bulls sold spot and bought back May futures, willing to pay out 0.28125. Swapping April for May required paying out 0.21875. The HSBC listed rates remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax remained unchanged. Subsequently, speculators and outsiders with gains all sold, but the market outlook remained the same. It was calculated that speculators gave Chinese banks a price of 5.71875 yuan for May US dollars, and that beneficial parties sold May British gold to Chinese merchants at 3 shillings and 9.0625 pence. There were no changes until the afternoon. The closing prices were 4 shillings and 1.125 pence for spot British gold and 6.03125 yuan for US dollars, the same as the opening prices this morning.</p>
<p>Both Spot and Futures Prices Loosened</p>
<p>The afternoon was unusually quiet. Only outsiders were willing to sell May British gold to Chinese merchants at a price of 3 shillings and 9.0625 pence. Until the evening closing, the situation changed. The closing prices were 4 shillings and 1.125 pence for spot British gold, 6.03125 yuan for US dollars, 4 shillings and 10.078125 pence for April British gold, 5.96875 yuan for US dollars, 3 shillings and 9.0625 pence for May British gold, and 5.6875 yuan for US dollars. In the end, spot British pounds were flat and US dollars were firm by 0.03125. April contracts loosened, British gold by 0.015625 and US dollars by 0.0625. May contracts for both British pounds and US dollars were firm by 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively.</p>
<p>Hong Kong - British Pound Flat, US Dollar Up</p>

Spot US dollars weakened by 0.0625 to 5.3125 yuan. The Shanghai dollar rose by 2 yuan to 112 yuan. Joint Reserve Notes were unchanged in the unofficial market, remaining at 102.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tightening Money Supply - Gold Market Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market for cash gold saw a decline because the money supply became increasingly tight today. Discount rates for bank drafts had already exceeded the 100 yuan mark, so the bearish trend remained unabated. Prices moved downward, but the decline was limited because people were not discouraged by the low prices. There were many people who saw an opportunity to buy. Because the foreign exchange market reported gains this morning, the opening price was lowered by 35 yuan compared to Saturday, opening at 5,755 yuan. After a while, the banks helped the gold shops, and a buying mood emerged, causing the price to rebound to 5,775 yuan. Soon, money changers and securities firms aggressively sold, and the price could not be sustained, falling to 5,750 yuan, the lowest price of the day. Later, it rebounded by 20 yuan, but the afternoon closing price was only 5,755 yuan. The market atmosphere had already changed before the afternoon opening. The price had already risen to 5,780 yuan upon opening, but because retail investors continued to sell, the supply exceeded demand, and the price eventually closed at 5,770 yuan. The market declined by 20 yuan overall. Trading volume for the day was about 2,000 taels. Jewelry gold was listed 5 yuan lower, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Falls by 20 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, with the exchange rate reported high and the US dollar loosening, the market sentiment was bearish, and the opening price immediately fell by 35 yuan. Money changers sold 50 taels of gold to gold shops for 5,755 yuan. Later, some gold shops were willing to buy, and banks followed suit, immediately rebounding by 20 yuan. Banks traded 20 taels of gold amongst themselves for 5,775 yuan. After that, securities firms and money changers competed to sell aggressively. Although a certain gold shop continuously bought on behalf of customers, they felt overwhelmed. The price fell by 25 yuan. Gold shops sold 10 taels to securities firms, at a loss, for 5,750 yuan. Around 11 o'clock, gold shops suddenly had the intention to buy, and relied on a certain gold shop to continue to buy in, and the sellers gradually decreased, so the price rebounded by 20 yuan. Gold shops bought 30 taels from banks for 5,770 yuan. Near closing, the buyers stopped their activity, and money changers came to sell again, dropping another 15 yuan. Money changers sold 30 taels to gold shops for 5,755 yuan. After the closing, the buying mood rebounded, and securities firms turned from selling to buying, immediately raising the price by 10 yuan. In the afternoon, banks first came to buy, buying 20 taels from their counterparts for 5,775 yuan. Later, a certain bank continued to buy, raising the price by another 5 yuan. Gold shops bought 30 taels from gold shops for 5,780 yuan. After the purchases, money changers and securities firms sold, and the price fell again, dropping by 10 yuan. Securities firms sold 30 taels to gold shops for 5,770 yuan as the closing price. Overall, the market declined by 20 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 30 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold shop's own brand of gold was several yuan higher than the cash gold price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current price of gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Down Another 5 Yuan</p>
<p>Initially, major jewelry stores were still quoting 585 yuan per tael for jewelry gold. At 9:40, the price was lowered by 5 yuan. There were no changes after that. The major jewelry stores changed their quote to 580 yuan. New jewelry stores had the same price as the old ones, with the buying price reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Loosening Trend for Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw funds flow into foreign stock markets, resulting in tighter money supply and weaker purchasing power for foreign currencies. Coupled with the rising trend in British gold prices, buyers became hesitant. British and American gold pounds continued to fall by 0.5 yuan. The market for British gold notes was also soft. American gold notes initially traded at 16.52 yuan, then rose to 16.55 yuan, and then fell back to 16.46 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell further to 16.44 yuan, and finally closed at 16.45 yuan, down 0.1 yuan compared to last Saturday. There was supply of Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, and Canadian notes, and market prices were very weak. Japanese gold notes were initially stable, but then the supply suddenly surged, and the evening market fell to 1.285 yuan. The supply of Korean notes was also smooth, and the evening market fell to 1.01 yuan. Other currencies remained stable.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Soars, Reaching 115 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bank drafts and notes soared dramatically. The discount rate per thousand yuan exceeded the 100 yuan mark. In the morning, it went straight from 85 yuan to 95 yuan. Around noon, it briefly fell back to 92 yuan. In the afternoon, cash became scarce, and demand became more urgent, soaring again to a final price of 115 yuan, more than 31 yuan higher than last Saturday. The Money Dealers Association's interbank lending rate remained unchanged at 0.2 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Although Actual Demand is Weak, Yarn Market Still Looking Up</h3>
<p>The yarn market is hovering with a tightening trend. This is because the market sentiment is good and yarn prices are still expected to rise. Therefore, although the US dollar has appreciated and the Huang Yu has loosened, the yarn market has not been affected and remains firm. Some say this is because spot goods are running out and the base is tight. However, the actual need is turning towards a weaker path. Now,</p>
<p>The yarn market opened well in the morning, and asking prices were very high, but there were few buyers. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,385 yuan, and the factory price was 1,370 yuan. Few accepted this price at the opening, and prices quickly fell back. At the same time, customer sales were weak, falling by more than 10 yuan. However, some parties, seeing the low prices, bought in a few dozen bales, and the market rebounded to more than 10 yuan. The Double Horse factory price reached 1,385 yuan. The total turnover for half a day was 1,650 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse factory yarn rose by 10 yuan. Yesterday, 1,210 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 45 pieces were shipped to Haikou. The amounts purchased by various brokers are listed below:</p>
<p>Counterparts: 130</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 190</p>
<p>Inland: 10</p>
<p>Tianjin: 100</p>
<p>Total: 1,651</p>
<h3>Spot Indian Cotton Selling Price More Than 20 Yuan Higher Than Contract Price</h3>
<p>The cotton market is unusually sluggish because the factories have no interest in buying, so market sentiment is mediocre. In addition, Indian cotton has been arriving from overseas recently, increasing inventory, so the cotton market feels particularly weak. Selling prices cannot rise and are bearish, which is very different from the yarn market. The spot cotton transaction situation is listed below:</p>
<p>2 Extra American Varieties: Counterparts purchased 200 bales at 310</p>
<p>Ordinary Good Er: 197 yuan, also 600 pieces at 198 yuan</p>
<p>Omra: 231 yuan, also 200 pieces</p>
<p>Dazhong Collection Packing: 247 yuan, also 140 pieces</p>
<p>General Packing: 224 yuan, also 200 pieces</p>
<p>Mitlin: 294 yuan, also 100 pieces</p>
<p>There has been another shipment of North Sha Songhua cotton. Yesterday, the Portuguese ship Avi Maria arrived in Shanghai from Qinglong Port, carrying 831 bales of cotton, which were transported away by customers using trucks. Today, 500 bales are being shipped to Tianjin for export.</p>
<p>In other news, foreign cotton prices. The New York cotton market initially fell due to mass selling, but later stabilized due to the strength of Wall Street and short covering. As a result, the market closed firmly, with both near-term and far-term contracts rising by 4-5 pounds compared to the previous day. India's daily forecast rose by more than 2 rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market continues to be very active. Because everyone believes that it is difficult to transport foreign cotton to Shanghai, spot goods have been selling well in the market for several days. Also, there are very few shipments arriving daily. In mid-May, except for small amounts of Indian cotton, there are almost no American cotton shipments. Currently, because yarn prices are high, factories are still opening a batch of cotton yarn. Although they have also ordered foreign cotton, this raw cotton cannot arrive in time, so the factories are quite empty. In recent days, they have been buying spot goods in the market, so spot prices are more than 20 yuan higher than contract prices. The factory price converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 6 yuan is as follows:</p>
<p>20 Count American Mitlin: 292.50</p>
<p>20 Count Subgrade: 282.10</p>
<p>32 Count: 307.60</p>
<p>32 Count Subgrade: 296.80</p>
<p>42 Count: 310.95</p>
<p>42 Count Subgrade: 300.85</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Eastern Piece Goods Firm and Expensive - Rebranded Eastern Goods Still Shipped to Inland Areas</h3>
<p>Because the end of the month is approaching, money is tight in the cloth market. Merchants are focused on the turnover rate, and many are selling at reduced prices. Cheap, readily available goods kept appearing in the morning market, and the market was particularly sluggish with few transactions. In the afternoon, prices for Eastern piece goods steadily rose, and the business of traders and real customers became active. Selling prices also rebounded after the decline, mostly returning to the closing prices from the previous week. More than 100,000 pieces of grey cloth, bleached cloth, and poplin were sold from local brokers. More than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, and coarse cloth were sold by the Wen Yong brokers. The Yue Min brokers also sold several hundred pieces. Recently, it has been heard that rebranded Eastern piece goods, printed with domestic product labels, are still being shipped to inland areas in considerable quantities. This should also be guarded against.</p>
<p>The Eastern cloth market was stable in the morning. In the afternoon, sales of fine cloth by the North brokers and local traders were very strong, so selling prices gradually rose. As a result, the price of each piece of fine cloth rose by about 2 yuan, and the price of each yard of serge rose by about 7 cents. The current spot price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is 44.75 yuan, and the price for next month is 47.5 yuan. The current market price for the Four Gentlemen brand serge has risen to 1.385 yuan, with a firm trend.</p>
<p>Piece goods exports: 725 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, 55 pieces were shipped to Haikou, and 54 pieces were shipped to Haiphong on the 22nd. 180 pieces were shipped to Yantai and 230 pieces were shipped to Tianjin on the 23rd.</p>
<h3>Serge Market Mixed - Weak and Strong Trends</h3>
<p>The serge market trend is inconsistent, with strong and weak trends. White serge is in short supply in the market. British-made top-grade serge is selling for 30 yuan per yard. The Fengyu brand is asking 23 yuan. Non-Western goods double yellow edges are asking 16.25 yuan, second-grade is 13.5 yuan. Domestic Deda top-grade is 16 yuan, second-grade is 14 yuan. Yuanchang gray-brown plain thin serge has limited actual sales, and prices are also mediocre. However, domestically produced products from the local factory have abundant inventory, and prices are generally weak. Prices for yellow-green colors have improved. Dagongming Yinfeng brand is sold in batches at 10.05 yuan, and Dalong is at 9.6 yuan per yard. The average price of Zangqing gray-brown colors is about 0.25 yuan cheaper. Medium-thick serge, because the weather is hot now, and its price is expensive, Zangqing Huate ne and Hanlimeng are more popular, so there is not much rise or fall. The Yihe 55 number is still sold in batches at 19.5 yuan, and the 39 number is at 16.5 yuan. Yesterday, 55 boxes of wool were shipped to Haizhou.</p>
<h3>Grains - Rice Stays Level - Rumor of 100,000 Bags of Guest Xian Rice Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The rice market is open for the first time after the holiday. Buying and selling directions have changed, and there is a feeling of being unable to hold on and having difficulty entering or exiting the market, so in the morning everyone adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Later, floating speculators and retail investors sought to sell off, and lacked a receiver for large amounts, so small amounts initially held at 43 yuan, but then the price went down all the way, only reaching 42.35 yuan, a drop of 0.5-0.7 yuan compared to the previous closing price of 43 yuan. After hovering for a long time, as various parties began to purchase, prices rose immediately. The prices of all goods were restored to their original levels, and the entire market ended with a flat situation.</p>
<p>The source of japonica and glutinous rice. The source of japonica rice has become scarce, with only five or six trucks from Suzhou and Tongxiang, totaling six to seven hundred bags. The glutinous rice transferred from Jiangyin is quite plentiful, no less than one thousand four to five hundred bags. The sales of japonica goods are still only in the off-site unofficial market, and it is heard that there is not much trade, with a depreciation of four to five cents. Wuxi held 46 yuan for japonica, and Changzhou white rice was 44-45 yuan. Other Suzhou Kun japonica in the central market ranged from 44-45 yuan to 43 yuan, Qing Si thin paddy rice ranged from 45 yuan to 43 yuan, and Nanhai early and late paddy ranged from 42-43 yuan. There are still customers hoarding glutinous rice, and the path to pastry shops and rice stalls is not weak, so although the goods are plentiful, there is not much impact. The selling price presents a stable and non-falling situation. If Liyang's Zhente Yuan is still 41 yuan, Special Grade is 40.05 yuan, 40 yuan, and other Dan Chang goods are mostly between 38-39 yuan, with only limited goods opening at 37.5 yuan. Yesterday, there was another rumor in the market that 100,000 bags of Jingwu and Jiangbei rice would arrive in port soon. It is not known whether this news is true or not. If it is true, then rice prices are likely to fall.</p>
<p>Imported rice is arriving in large quantities, but the overall situation is still weak. Although the merchants have set new non-cutting prices, intending to hold firm, but actual sales are sluggish, and non-professional speculators have shifted their attention to other commodities. Therefore, the holding situation was eventually broken by floating investors selling off their profits. However, the floating investors did not sell much. Spot rice only fell by 0.2-0.3 yuan in the morning, and continued to fall slightly in the afternoon. The lineup of long and short positions on the futures market is gradually shifting. Most of the shorts are original root firms, while the longs are northern gangs and big players. Both sides are evenly matched, and the market has entered a stable situation. However, about 20-30% still belong to general floating investors, so the August-September No. 2 Saigon early market stood at the original price of 54.5 yuan, but was depressed by the floating investors selling off their profits in the afternoon, with the closing price at 54.35 yuan, a slight drop of 0.15 yuan, and the immediate delivery price at 52.5 yuan. The immediate delivery price for No. 2 Siam was 52.2 yuan. 300 pieces of returning original packages were opened in the general market, and about 7,000 bags of spot goods.</p>
<p>Imported rice arriving in Shanghai. The Yihuo Steamship Company Mingsheng Wheel arrived in port from Hong Kong the day before yesterday (21st), carrying 7,951 bags of imported rice, and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf. The unloading onto the wharf began yesterday morning. Large amounts of imported rice and corn are being shipped north recently. Today, the Taikoo Company's Xin Beijing Wheel exported 700 bags of Shanghai-shipped imported rice and more than 6,000 bags of imported corn to Tianjin, and 2,000 bags of imported corn to Yantai.

<h3>Coal - Charcoal Arrivals Increase - Prices Have Fallen</h3>
<p>The charcoal market is sluggish. Selling prices vary greatly, because large quantities have been sold in the occupied areas such as Shenjiamen and Dinghai, resulting in too many retail investors, a lack of interest from buyers, and a chaotic market. It is estimated that the price of Wenzhou grade A charcoal is 8.3-8.4 yuan per dan, Haimen bamboo charcoal is 6.2 yuan, and Huangyan flat charcoal is 5.6-5.7 yuan per dan, a fall compared to last month.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake - Oil Market Falls Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, bean oil fell slightly compared to the end of last week. Bean oil continues to arrive, and sales are flat. Only the merchants are slightly active, so there is little development in the market. The Gang and Guizhou sesame oil also lost momentum. Yesterday, only 2,500 cans were purchased. The stance of Jiangbei Benfang bean oil is soft (the price is 170 yuan). Other Benjie traders sold 400 pieces of degummed Jiaozhou bean oil for 77 yuan, 20 barrels of Qingdao bean oil for 107 yuan, and 1,000 cans of Yantai bean oil for 100 yuan. Dalian oil was traded at 150 barrels for 106 yuan, Bengbu oil at 20 barrels for 102 yuan, Qingqi oil at 100 pieces for 75 yuan, Yanqi oil at 400 pieces for 76 yuan, Jiaozhou oil at 200 pieces for 74 yuan, and Dayou factory oil at 100 dan for 75.5 yuan. On the 22nd, 1,335 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Silk Market Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market: Yokohama spot goods 1,470 yuan, up 30 yuan; near-term 1,480 yuan, up 31 yuan; far-term 1,508 yuan, up 28 yuan. Market sentiment here has been invigorated. Except for white factory silk, Yihuo Xinfu Dachang bought 90 dan of Ji Li warp silk and 20 dan of Zhonggan silk. Selling prices fell nearly 10 yuan from before. The market atmosphere has not loosened, but US sales are still sluggish.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 500 bales of Husi were shipped to Europe, 24 pieces were shipped to Suez, 209 pieces of silk waste were shipped to Europe, and 40 boxes of artificial silk were shipped from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Tea Leaves: Strong Trade in Both Import and Export</h3>
<p>In recent days, the source of raw tea leaves from inland areas has been quite abundant. Among those for domestic sales, there were over 800 packages of new Longjing and Qiqiang tea shipped from Wenzhou, and over 1200 packages of old stock. From Ningbo, over 2000 packages of raw tea leaves also arrived. Including the original stock on the market, the total is estimated to be no less than 20,000 packages. However, the sales to foreign firms remain sluggish. Yesterday, only Yongxing Baochang and other firms purchased over 80 boxes of Zhongzhuang Zhenmei tea, with prices ranging from 210 to 225 yuan, a drop of over 10 yuan in the market price.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Secondary School Guidance Research Association Cables President Chiang and Minister Chen, Reaffirming Original Intention to Support National Resistance and Reconstruction Policies</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Guidance Research Association yesterday sent a cable to Chongqing, stating: Urgent, respectfully to President Chiang of the Central Party Headquarters and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, Chongqing. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, three years have passed. The recovery of our homeland is within sight. Under your leadership, our association supports the national resistance and reconstruction policies, maintaining our original intention. We encourage each other to guide the youth and work together in our respective positions. Even if the pressure increases, we vow to persevere to the end. We earnestly request guidance to uphold the law. We submit this message with grief and indignation, hoping for your consideration. Sincerely, the Shanghai Secondary School Guidance Research Association.</p>
<h3>Overview of Adult Education Year Implementation in Guizhou Province (1)</h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) Lei Binnan, Director of the Education Department of Guangxi Province, recently wrote an article entitled "Overview of Adult Education Year Implementation in Guangxi Province," detailing the implementation of adult education in the province. The full text is excerpted below:</p>
<p>(I) Introduction</p>
<p>The popularization of basic national education in this province began to be planned and implemented in 1933. In the process of implementation, adult education and children's education were carried out simultaneously, without any distinction. Since the implementation, schools have been widely established, and children's education has also been quite effective. However, adult education has not been able to achieve the planned goals due to the limitations of teachers and funding in the past. It is estimated that from 1934 to the end of 1938, a total of 1,550,425 illiterate people were eliminated, according to surveys, with an average of 380,000 illiterate people eliminated each year. There are still more than 2 million out-of-school adults in the province. If education continues at the previous pace, it will take more than five years to achieve universal education. At the second stage of the war, the demand for mobilizing the masses to participate in the war and national construction work is extremely urgent. Our supreme leader once pointed out to the people of the country the principle that politics is more important than military affairs. It is even more imperative to educate and train the masses without delay. In order to quickly complete the popularization of adult education and meet the needs of the war and national construction, it was determined that 1939 would be the Adult Education Year in this province. Human and financial resources were concentrated to thoroughly popularize adult education throughout the province within one year, in order to strengthen mass mobilization and bring into play the power of war resistance and national construction. This arduous task has been accomplished within the expected time limit as a result of the concerted efforts of the education community throughout the province and the enthusiastic participation of the masses throughout the province. However, due to the impact of the war in southern Guangxi, the data has not been collected and compiled, and a detailed report has not yet been made. At this time, only a brief outline of the implementation and the experience gained and the difficulties encountered in the implementation process can be provided for correction by domestic sages.</p>
<p>(II) Implementation Plan</p>
<p>The implementation of adult education is based on the "Implementation Plan for the Adult Education Year in Guangxi Province." The design process and content highlights of this plan are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Design Process: Between September and October 1938, this province had the motive to concentrate efforts to popularize adult education in 1939. In late December, the Provincial Government Committee decided that 1939 would be the Adult Education Year in this province. As a result, the large-scale popularization of adult education became a settled matter. The design was immediately started, and a symposium on adult education was held on January 4th and 5th, which decided to organize a drafting committee. Tong Runzhi, Yang Weiyu, Dong Weichuan, and Lin Wanli were hired as committee members, as well as the responsible personnel of the Education Department. Meetings were held five times before and after January 5th to 18th, and many small group meetings were held. By the end of January, the entire plan was completed, and it was approved by the Provincial Government Committee at the 195th meeting on February 4th and promulgated on the same day.</p>
<p>(2) Plan Content: This plan consists of 19 chapters and 64 articles, divided into purpose, goals, implementation principles, organization and equipment, enrollment and staffing, teachers, curriculum and teaching materials, teaching, guidance, graduation, continuing education, special ethnic education, inspection, assessment, funding, implementation procedures, summary, and appendices. In addition, there are six appendices regarding the organization of provincial and county promotion committees, teacher training, enrollment surveys, guidance goals, and examples of social activities. The plan stipulates that all out-of-school adults aged 18 to 45, and those who cannot read and understand the first two volumes of the textbook for civil schools promulgated by the Ministry of Education, must enroll in adult classes. All levels of basic national schools, county-run private secondary schools and above, and local cultural and industrial groups should set up adult classes, with at least 25 students and a maximum of 50 students per class (at least 15 students in mobile teaching classes). Classes should be divided by gender in principle, and a lottery compulsory enrollment method should be used, divided into periods for handling within one year. Each period lasts two months, and classes are held for two hours each day (no rest on Sundays), and the implementation process is stipulated to achieve the goal according to the schedule.</p>
<h3>Seven Educational Films Produced by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 21st) The Ministry of Education is currently entrusting the Central Film Studio to produce educational films, including seven types such as (Charcoal Vehicle), (Vegetable Oil Vehicle), (Songpan Cotton), Children's Nursery, (Refugee Children), (Bristles), and (Grass Leaves). They are currently being produced and will be completed shortly.</p>
<h3>Provincial Nantong Middle School Headquarters Decided to be Located in Dongtai, Provincial Government Appoints Yao Baiyu as Principal</h3>
<p>The headquarters of Jiangsu Provincial Putong Middle School is located in northern Jiangsu, as part of the provincial school relocation plan. Since the provincial government officially appointed Yao Baiyu as the principal, he immediately began active preparations. It is reported that the new school site has been determined to be in Dongliujiaoxie, and a spacious house belonging to a certain family has been rented as student dormitory. School equipment and everything are being arranged. In addition to selecting and hiring several teachers who have previously served in provincial schools and have rich knowledge and experience, the school's guiding principles will be based on the laws and regulations to implement resistance and construction education to meet the needs of youth in northern Jiangsu. It will enroll students in Shanghai in mid-July to allow students from northern Jiangsu to return home to study. The provincial Nantong Middle School currently located in Shanghai has been converted into a branch school.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Education Authorities Actively Training Teachers, Normal School Expected to be Completed in Summer and Autumn</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong government has recently been actively improving education in Hong Kong. The promulgation of the new education ordinance is one of the steps. The strict limitation of teachers is also an important part of the plan. The purpose of this move by the Hong Kong government is to train teachers and standardize the educational level of Hong Kong with other British colonies. It is now found that the normal school under construction on Bonham Road is expected to be completed in the summer and autumn. The establishment of this school is purely for training teachers to supply schools throughout Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Public Exhibition Cup Handball Second Round: Double Matches Tonight, Success or Failure Depends on the Efforts of China Youth Team</h3>
<p>In the tenth Public Exhibition Cup handball, the China Youth team has already won the first round. In the ten singles matches of the second round last week, they were greatly threatened. Currently, the West Youth team is leading with seven wins and three losses. The success or failure of the championship will depend on the last five doubles matches. The West Youth team only needs to win one more match to win the second round. Therefore, the China Youth team must win all five doubles matches. Otherwise, a third round must be held to decide the championship of this year. The order of doubles matches for tonight and tomorrow night is as follows:</p>
<p>April 23 (Tuesday)</p>
<p>Gao Zishou Sun Baoqi vs. Lie Que Te Ocha Liao (Double Five) 6:00 PM</p>

<h3>Helsinki Olympic Games Cancelled</h3>
<p>(Helsinki, April 22nd, Reuters) Finnish member of the International Olympic Committee, Mr. Frankel, declared that Finland will not hold the 1940 Olympic Games. The International Olympic Games were originally scheduled to be held in Finland this year. After the end of the Soviet-Finnish War, people still hoped that preparations could continue.</p>
<h3>Track and Field Match: Mai Ling Overwhelms American Children, Result 62 to 33, Lun Bo Takes Three Championships</h3>
<p>The first sound of track and field this year, the friendly match between Mai Ling and American Children, was held at the American Children's Sports Ground at 2:30 PM last Saturday. In the seven events, Mai Ling took four and American Children took three. In the half-mile relay, the American team was evenly matched and overwhelmed Mai Ling. Mai Ling dominated the field events. In the end, Mai Ling defeated American Children by a large margin of 62 to 33. Mai Ling's Lun Bo won three championships alone. His score of 10.2 seconds in the 100-meter dash equaled the record set by Edward at the Central and Western Group Games last year, which was the most outstanding. In addition, Mai Ling's Ross in the shot put, Kerrens in the high jump, and American Children's Baylor in the 880-yard race, with such results at the beginning of the season, are all commendable. The results of each event are recorded below:</p>
<p>Track Events: (100 yards) Lun Bo (Mai Ling) 10.2 seconds, (200 yards) Lun Bo (Mai Ling) 23.5 seconds, (440 yards) Lun Bo (Mai Ling) 55.8 seconds, (880 yards) Baylor (American Children) 2 minutes 10 seconds, (1 mile) Huale (American Children) 5 minutes 10.4 seconds, (120-yard low hurdles) Que Bo (Mai Ling) 15.8 seconds, (880-yard relay) American Children's Team, 39.4 seconds.</p>

<h3>International Table Tennis China Team Representatives Selected, Lu Hanjun, Liang Yujie, etc. Ten People, Chen Linsheng Serves as General Leader of Men and Women Teams</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Table Tennis Association, in order to select male and female representatives of the Chinese team to participate in the International Table Tennis Championships and win the title, held a special executive committee meeting in Room 209, 2nd Floor, Continental Bank at 7:00 PM last night. Xu Duo, Lu Zhongqiu, Liu Keren, Chen Linsheng, Hu Jiankun, etc. were present, chaired by Xu Duo and recorded by Hu Jiankun. Wang Yi and Ding Du were present as observers. First, Chen Linsheng reported on the status of various cup matches. Regarding the issue of male and female players of the Chinese team, the directors carefully considered and decided to use the qualifications and experience of those who recently won the championships of each group of the three Jingwu Cups as the standard. Lu Hanjun (captain), Zhang Ying, Ouyang Wei, Ji Zongpei, and Deng Xiurong were elected as official representatives, and Huang Zhijun was the alternate. In the women's group, Liang (captain), Lin (Hua Lian Woman), Huang Tongyin, and Zhang Yongru (Female Youth, etc.) were elected as representatives. The association, in view of Chen Linsheng's tireless efforts and services, unanimously elected him as the general leader of the men's and women's teams, responsible for presiding over team affairs. It also sent a letter to hire Dr. Chen Zheng, president of the China Mental Hospital, as the medical consultant of the Chinese team. The uniforms of the entire Chinese team have been donated by China Table Tennis Company, which is commendable.</p>
<h3>Jingwu Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Huang Zhijun and Li Zongpei Win the Ninth and Tenth Groups Championship</h3>
<p>The third Spiritual Cup Individual Table Tennis Tournament was held in the afternoon the day before yesterday at 2:00 PM in the association's billiard room for the elimination rounds of the ninth group. Because it was a Sunday holiday, more than 300 people watched. Zhang Zhihong, the seeded player of this group and the fourth-place winner of the previous tournament, was highly regarded with his excellent offense and defense. However, he had been neglecting practice recently. In the first and second rounds of the rematch, he encountered strong resistance. Fortunately, he was careful and managed to turn defeat into victory and advance to the final week. Another Allied friend and strong player, Huang Zhijun, almost fell victim to the fierce attacks of Zhang Yuan in the rematch. Ultimately, relying on his rich experience, he defeated Zhang Yuan with a score of 11 to 9 in the final game and entered the final with Zhang Zhihong. Zhang appeared fatigued, choosing to hit the ball instead of defending, resulting in many wild shots. Huang took the opportunity to attack, putting on an excellent performance. He also had good luck, and although the scores of each game were close, Huang ultimately won the final victory. As a result, Huang Zhijun defeated Zhang Zhihong with a score of 3 to 0, winning the ninth group championship.</p>
<p>Huang Zhijun: 11-8, 11-9, 12-10 Zhang Zhihong</p>
<p>The final battle between Li Zongpei and Fang Yumin in the tenth group began at 7:00 PM in the evening. Li defeated two formidable opponents, Ye Maozhi and Zhong Xianfang, in the first two rounds, demonstrating extraordinary strength. Fang Yumin had suffered a crushing defeat to Li in the previous tournament and was eager to avenge himself this time, putting up an exceptionally fierce fight. However, he missed a sure-win opportunity in the first game, giving Li Zongpei the chance to come from behind. His morale inevitably declined, and he ultimately suffered a crushing defeat of 3 straight sets, allowing Li Zongpei to win the championship. Now, the champions of all ten groups in the Jingwu Cup have been determined. The organizing authorities plan to hold a round-robin tournament among the ten group champions to determine the overall championship.</p>
<p>Li Zongpei: 13-11, 11-9, 11-6 Fang Yumin</p>

<h3>Studies on Copper Production in Yunnan Province (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Guanzi said, "The distance from east to west is 28,000 li, and from north to south is 26,000,000 li. Those that produce water are 8,000 li, and those that receive water are 8,000 li. There are 467 mountains that produce copper and 3,690 mountains that produce iron." The Biographies of Money-Makers says, "Copper and iron are found every thousand li, often with mountains producing them in a checkerboard pattern." Suoyin says, "It means like placing chess pieces, there is often one." The Treatise on Food and Money in the Book of Wei says, "Shangshu Cui Xian reported that there are copper mines in Hengnong Quntong Qinggu, with one dou yielding five liang and four zhu of copper. In the Qichigu mine, one dou yields eight liang of copper. Yanzhushan in Nanqingzhou and Shangshan in Qizhou are both old sites of copper officials." From this, we can infer that the amount of copper mined in Yunnan may vary, but the mountains and valleys are steep and deep, and the mineral deposits are likely similar to what is recorded in historical texts. However, all mining methods require pumping water. Gold is the mother of water, and wherever metals are produced, water accumulates. Therefore, copper mining always involves expenses for draining water, as is the case with silver mines. Between summer and autumn, there is a lot of water in the mine shafts, making drainage difficult, so operations are suspended to avoid damaging the mines. However, this is only the case before Western machinery was introduced to China. When looking for mines, one should first seek mountains with abundant shapes, solid geological veins, and lush vegetation, with mineral indicators visible. If there is indeed a reliable indication, then one should proceed according to regulations to avoid waste. In Yunnan Province, wherever there are mountains with mines, the surrounding hills must show mineral indicators. One should then search carefully. When a true indicator is found, the ore formation gradually becomes a patch, which the Yunnan people call "brushing the trough." From there, tunnels are dug. The wider ones are called "halls." From forming a trough to forming a hall, one finally has a prosperous mine. If soil and rocks are mixed together, it is called "loose wasteland." It is easy to lose money on labor if it is opened and then abandoned. In severe cases, the lower part may be opened, and the upper part may collapse, which could endanger lives. Not only will the assets be lost, but lawsuits will also arise. The Yunnan people call this "being covered," like a blanket covering one's head and face, so that one can no longer see the sun.</p>

<h3>An Artist of War</h3>
<p>— Pinpin</p>
<p>Dr. Stoltzenberg is a modern European eccentric! Truly, from his appearance, Dr. Stoltzenberg is a distinguished scientist: tall, thin, kind, steady, with gentle blue eyes. Everything indicates that he is an old-fashioned scholar. This demeanor of his "tells that he has the spirit of a martyr for pure science: without hypocrisy, worn out by hard work and diligence. He once said, "People should not forget the great value of pure science and its inestimable benefits to all mankind."</p>
<p>He has a great laboratory in Hamburg, where he hopes to quietly study his "pure science."</p>
<p>His factory is filled with many workers, relying on marvelous machines, manufacturing poison gas under his command.</p>
<p>Once, due to careless manufacturing, his factory leaked poison gas, permeating most of Hamburg, poisoning thousands of people, and killing hundreds of workers. Afterwards, the doctor said, "The disaster is truly regrettable. No one can sympathize with the dead as much as I do - but this is an inevitable price we must pay for the research of pure science." The doctor is too enthusiastic about his "pure science." Therefore, in addition to the factory in Hamburg, the doctor has also secretly established countless similar factories in Madrid and other places.</p>
<p>In the last European war, the doctor supervised the production of a large number of poison gases to kill the Allied soldiers. He is a destroyer of culture; he makes women and children weep; he rapes science.</p>
<p>Dr. Stoltzenberg is addicted to war, and he has recently made many amazing inventions to make war more lovely and lovable.</p>
<p>He invented the "Butterfly" gas mask. According to the doctor's insight, people look very ugly wearing gas masks, which is detrimental to the beauty of women and very uncomfortable for children. Barbarians often tattoo their faces and bodies when going to war, but we are already civilized people, and aesthetic and hygiene concepts are most needed. Therefore, the doctor imitated the masks worn during festivals and made a type of "Butterfly gas mask." Soldiers wear it with majesty and beauty, women wear it like butterflies flitting among flowers, and children wear it softly and comfortably. The doctor is truly clever, he wants to turn cruel war into a happy festival. With this beautiful gas mask, people will not oppose gas warfare, and the doctor will become the top-tier rich man.</p>
<p>The second "contribution" to beautifying war is the doctor's "Rainbow Mist." He mixes various poison gases to form a "mist," because poison gases come in many colors, such as cyan, yellow, and green. If you add some other colors and mix them, wouldn't it be a "rainbow"? Under the "Rainbow Mist," hundreds of thousands of soldiers break out in cold sweats, their blood vessels rupture, their lungs rot, they go mad, and their flesh turns to pulp. This is beautiful enough, but Dr. Stoltzenberg is not yet fully satisfied with this invention. He hopes to make the "Rainbow Mist" have no odor at all (perhaps even make it fragrant and sweet), so that it meets the ideal of "pure science." - The sky is filled with colorful and fragrant "Rainbow Mist," and people die happily without realizing it. Dying like angels, Dr. Stoltzenberg is indeed an "artist" of war.</p>
<p>If we practice, wearing "Butterfly" gas masks, strolling under the "Rainbow Mist," wouldn't it be an excellent entertainment? The doctor created a new civilization - a civilization of death. Doctor, great scholar, he makes mankind love death, because he makes war into entertainment.</p>
<p>Does this represent human progress? Or regression?</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>The Sacrifice</h3>
<p>— Jinchuan</p>
<p>My grandmother sacrificed her life because she didn't go to school. It's not that she didn't have the opportunity to go to school, but this opportunity was sacrificed to "superstition." She often complained about her fate, recounting her experiences of not going to school. My maternal grandfather's family was very wealthy, and my grandmother was an only daughter, so my great-grandfather very much wanted to educate her and turn her into a useful woman. So he hired a teacher for her. This was truly a big deal in a remote village. The villagers were envious, so they sent their sons to attend school with rice offerings. There were usually about ten students. But in just half a year, there was a joke. My grandmother was very smart and quickly learned to read Tang poetry, while these many boys were still reciting the Three Character Classic. This caused an uproar in the entire village. They all said, "Women cannot study, women studying takes away the talent of men." So all the villagers gathered together to force my grandmother to drop out of school. The parents at the time were also helpless and had to dismiss the teacher and stop her from studying. This became a sacrifice to superstition, a regret for life!</p>
<p>Now this phenomenon will no longer exist, but I am writing this story to give the ladies on the isolated island who have the superior environment to study a comparison, so they can know the difficulty of women studying at that time, and now that they have books to read steadily, and skills to learn, they should work hard to strive to become a woman who contributes to society.</p>

<h3>Two Questions</h3>
<p>— Aisi</p>
<p>In his address to youth, the modern French writer Andre Maurois answered two very important questions:</p>
<p>(1) What is the most valuable lesson that life teaches us?</p>
<p>(2) How can a young person maintain normality in difficulty?</p>
<p>In response to the first question, he said: "The purpose of the art of living is to eliminate the useless and painful experiences, and replace them with a pure and selfless appreciation of beauty." He further cited examples from facts, saying: "Escape from pain can be obtained from reading, music and other creative pleasures." Regarding human emotions, he said, "Stay away from those who hurt us, and then unpleasant memories will gradually fade." Finally, he said regarding the second lesson that life shows us: "Only a very few people are extremely bad. A young person who has always lived in a gently family life will be surprised by cruelty, selfishness, and suspicion when he first comes into contact with the outside world, and therefore think that everything he encounters must be this kind of bad phenomenon. In fact, his pessimism, thinking that mankind is very despicable, is not without basis. But when we know people a little more deeply, we will also feel that most people can be kind, can be gentle, and everyone has a heroic spirit. At this point, we begin to realize that what is hidden in the armor of sin is actually fear of life. The most common thing is that all ignorance stems from blind knowledge and action. The famous British essayist Charles Lamb once said, "I hate that person." At that time, an auditor objected and said, "But you don't know him deeply." Lamb said, "Of course, I have never known him deeply." "Do you think I would hate someone I know deeply?" Therefore, the most precious lesson that life gives us is sincere trust in human nature, regardless of the sins he commits after tomorrow, and regardless of his madness after tomorrow. Because all sins and madness are just a result, not a cause."</p>
<p>Regarding the second question, Maurois believes that our lives should be built on a solid foundation and should adhere to strict discipline. "If we can wholeheartedly abide by the discipline of religious life, the discipline of work, and the discipline of various games, they are pure and useful. In addition, we should seek unity of plan and perseverance in work. A young person is often tempted by various unlimited possible tasks. In fact, every young person should make choices. Although he likes to make various friends; likes endless travels; likes to pursue boundless knowledge; likes to engage in various careers; and experience every kind of love; but life must have limits; he must make choices, only in this way can he live deeply and richly."</p>

<h3>Meddling is Necessary</h3>
<p>— Qiu</p>
<p>A child sees a wild boy bullying a group of ducklings on the road and strikes up to "fight for justice." As a result, he gets a face full of mud thrown at him by the wild boy. When he gets home, his father grabs his ear and scolds him, "Who told you to meddle!"</p>
<p>A primary school student can't bear to see his friend suffer a severe punishment from the teacher, so he begs the teacher to forgive him. But the teacher glares at him and says, "Don't you meddle!"</p>
<p>Everyone has been educated since childhood with "don't meddle in other people's business" and has studied the "maxim" of "each sweeps the snow from his own door, and does not care about the frost on another's roof." When they grow up, they imitate the behavior of the "sages" who "cultivate themselves alone." The upper class pretends to be "gentlemen" and "elders." The lower class also feels that they are "not ashamed before heaven, nor ashamed before men," that they are "good citizens."</p>
<p>Therefore: The "toss-top-hats" on rickshaws, the "pocket-touchers" on streetcars, bystanders only treat them as a "performance" and absolutely no one helps to catch the "pickpocket." The ruffians in the alley "extort money," bystanders only treat it as a debate, and no one is willing to say a "fair word." When the police on the road are chasing thieves, bystanders only hide under the telephone poles and will never step forward to help catch them. In short, the minds of every bystander are flooded with a huge wave of "don't meddle in other people's business": This huge wave has overturned the small boat of "acting bravely for a just cause"!</p>
<p>Therefore, there are only people in society who help "evil" grow; and no one supports "justice." That "evil" is growing vigorously like spring bamboo shoots, unstoppable; and "justice" is gradually withering like autumn grass, "unable to revive"!</p>
<p>Indeed, if you meddle in other people's business and fight for justice, it will provoke the hatred of the "evil-doers" who will unite to attack you; but why are there only groups of "evil-doers" in society, and no groups of "righteous people"?</p>
<p>Meddle in other people's business! Meddle in other people's business! I hope that all the "righteous people" will unite to meddle in other people's business! Don't stand idly by and watch the growth of "evil" and let "justice" perish!</p>
<h3>The Color-Changing Fish</h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>Most fish can adapt to the surrounding environment and change their body color. Blind fish have gray-white bodies and can never change again. Fish that are blind in one eye also have gray-white on the side of the body opposite the blind eye, while the blind side can still change with the environment. This is due to the effects of endocrine and nerve function.</p>
<h3>The Weight of Rice</h3>

<h3>Being a Son of God (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Jesus never said that our life is a long and sweet song, he understood that life is a beehive full of hardships. According to him, religion is not to remove these hardships for good people, but to give people the power to bravely face hardships and become victors through struggle. Religion may not give you satisfaction, but it can give you power. Religion does not give you protection from danger, but it can give you the courage to face danger without fear. What Jesus taught and what he practiced permanently is that religion always has a power that is sufficient for the brave. It not only helps people overcome all adversity but also guides people to make moral progress and achieve spiritual victory. In today's difficulties in all aspects, in our personal experience, and in the competition of world affairs, isn't this the time for us to give Jesus' test a suitable opportunity? I wholeheartedly believe that religion can meet our needs and can cultivate a kind of personality that gives meaning and purpose to this chaotic world. "He gave them the power to become sons of God," as the author of the Gospel of John recorded, this sentence implies that there are still great areas of human experience that have not been reached. If people dare to do this, they will not harm each other, hate each other, but will make themselves and help others to be good sons of the heavenly Father. We urgently need to address this question today: "What are you becoming?" or rather, "What do you want to be?" In the famous work of Rhodes, there is this passage: "After twenty or twenty-five years, when you meet a person in the road that you knew when you were young, sometimes it will shock you very much. You remember seeing him when he was young, his face was beautiful, his attitude was charming, different from others. Now? Haggard, thin, because he neglected physical exercise when he was young. In addition, what has become of his thoughts? There was also a person whom you admired in the past, you can almost say that he was the driving force for you to work hard. Whenever you came into contact with him, you were passionate, your thoughts were alert, and you were determined to work hard to read more, think more, and do more meaningful things. There was an internal force driving you forward. You knew that you couldn't catch up with him, but because of him, you certainly made greater progress. After many years, you meet him and can't help but ask yourself, "What has become of his sharp mind and courageous spirit?" Why does he seem so ordinary? What he thinks and says is the same as others? His attitude and words show that he has given up the struggle to build himself into a more excellent, more real, and more great personality.

<h3>Shirley Temple's Success Story - Today is Her Eleventh Birthday -</h3>
<p>— Xinying</p>
<p>Time flies so fast, Shirley Temple is already eleven years old. She was born on April 23, 1929; therefore, today is her eleventh birthday. Here, I will write some about Shirley Temple's success story:</p>
<p>Eight Years of Film Life Since she stepped onto the screen at the age of three, Shirley Temple's film life has been a full eight years by this year, when she is eleven years old. During these eight years, she has indeed earned a lot of money. When she first started on the screen, she only earned $250 per week, but it soon increased to a price of $75,000 for each film she made. Since she was five years old, she has been enjoying good luck, and her popularity has continued to this day, leaving an impression on movie fans in every corner of the world.</p>
<p>A Virtuous Mother Shirley Temple is innocent and lively on the screen. Such acting skills are of course due to her artistic talent. But in addition to talent, we also have to give credit to her mother's proper upbringing. Mrs. Temple pays attention to everything for this money-making daughter and loves her. Whether it is in physical or artistic aspects, she does not allow her to suffer setbacks. Under a virtuous mother and proper upbringing, Shirley Temple can also go straight to the road to success.</p>
<p>Special Treatment by the Company For Shirley Temple, Fox Film Company has also earned a lot of money. The main point is that the films starring Shirley Temple have low costs and high box office. For this reason, this little star is also treated specially. She does not film at night, and filming does not exceed the time stipulated in the contract. Not only is Shirley Temple's salary so high, but even her mother also receives a weekly salary of $150.</p>
<p>No Substitute Found Shirley Temple is now eleven years old, and her childhood has passed in an instant. Whether she will continue to make films on the screen in the future has become a question. Some say that she will leave the screen, and others say that she will continue to make films. But in any case, she has been declining recently, and the films she has made have not been as popular as in previous years, which is certain. Therefore, her fate in the future cannot be said for sure. Hollywood is constantly discovering child stars, but a second Shirley Temple, this substitute has not yet been found. It can be seen that it is not an easy thing for a child star to achieve the same success as Shirley Temple!</p>
<h3>Recent Events in Film City</h3>
<p>— Degang</p>
<p>Sonja Henie Becomes a US Citizen The Hollywood skating star Sonja Henie, originally from Norway, recently decided to become a US citizen. According to Miss Sonja herself, the reason for this is that she will never have to be afraid of the Germans again. But according to people who are familiar with Miss Sonja, she became a US citizen to avoid the US government's various taxes on foreign film actors. This reason may be correct, because Miss Sonja is a very thrifty girl!</p>
<p>Movie Stars Peddling Cigars At the Coco Club in Hollywood, a grand dance party was recently held, hosted by Korda, and all the proceeds were used to benefit British and French charities. Countless famous movie stars, such as Myrna Loy, Olivia de Havilland, Annabella, Merle Oberon, Diana Lynn, etc., wore waitress outfits and peddled cigars to the dancers, priced at $25 per box. In an instant, they were all sold out.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple to Retire After filming one more film, child star Shirley Temple will leave the film industry and return to the life of an ordinary girl, because her golden age has passed. After Shirley leaves, the only remaining child star is Kim Hye-soo. Miss Kim is known for her naughtiness and activity, unlike Shirley who is known for her innocence. I wonder if the audience can accept Miss Kim ascending the child star throne left by Shirley?</p>
<h3>Drama Trends</h3>
<p>— Futing</p>
<p>Ms. Tang Ruoqing, the leading actress of the China Travel Troupe, is scheduled to return to Shanghai in mid-month to participate in the Xuan Palace's performance of Empress Dowager Cixi.</p>
<p>Since participating in the New World Refugee Relief Performance organized by the Association, the members of the Yinyin Drama Society have been extremely excited. The president of the society, Chen Taojun, plans to have long-term performances, and the location has been selected on the sixth floor of the Pudong Building. The work is currently underway.</p>
<p>After returning to Shanghai from Kunming, the famous director Zhang Guoguang and the shipping tycoon Mr. Chen Qirui jointly established a theater. The location is planned to be built near Dahua Road, which can be realized in two or three months.</p>
<p>The China Drama Society's long-publicized great historical drama "Emperor Gaozu of Han" is said to be in accelerated rehearsal. After "Emperor Gaozu of Han," those who have already started preparations include "Qin Liangyu," "Wen Tianxiang," and "Three Sisters."</p>
<p>After the martyrdom of Li Xiucheng, Lafayette will perform Liang Hongyu, starring Lan Lan.</p>
<p>Since Hu E took charge of the Drama Group of the Hualian Tongle Association, it has become lively. It is now planned to hold a disaster relief performance in the main auditorium of the association at the end of this month. The play is titled "Men and Women in Chaotic Times," directed by Ms. Xia Xia.</p>
<p>Miss Liang Yan has returned to the drama world and joined the Torch Drama Society, co-starring with Zhang Guoguang in "Jealousy," adapted from Hu Chunbing's original work, scheduled to be performed within the month. (Proceeds will be used to relieve the disaster)</p>
<h3>Actor News</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Ye Qiuxin has already arranged with the Kuide Troupe to return to Tianjin from Shanghai, and is just waiting for the money to be remitted before setting off. The day before yesterday, Qiuxin received a letter from the leader of the troupe, saying that they would have to wait another week before they could remit the money. Qiuxin also replied in a letter, saying that she would wait for another week at most, and if it was overdue, she would give up, because Wuhu is doing its best to invite her.</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu, the pillar of the Golden Stage, will leak a masterpiece, "The Robbery of the Peony," and his friends are launching a public banquet.</p>
<p>Qun Dan Qiuyunyan is scheduled to go north on the fourth of next month with Madam Yao Mulian and Ms. Xiao Xiangyun at the same time. On the day before she leaves, she will also host a banquet for her friends to show her farewell.</p>
<h3>Silver Flowers of Art</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Li Lihua, the female lead in "The Heroic Lovers," is a new talent whom Art China values highly. Li comes from the theater, specializing in Qingyi roles, and her appearance is extremely beautiful. Her father is the once-famous Xiaosheng (young male role) Li Guifang. Li Lihua's performance on the silver screen is quite brilliant. Art China claims to have found another Yuan Meiyun, which shows her position in Art China.</p>
<p>The critical circle unanimously believes that Cao E, a promising newcomer, played the role of Hongzhu, Zhang Wenyuan's lover, in "Cherishing the Beauty in the Boudoir." Her charming expressions are very wonderful. However, Cao E has a strange habit of liking to cry; women can't escape this flaw.</p>
<p>Zhang Cuihong is becoming more and more beautiful. Recently, she has been filming "Guanyin" day and night. Although the work is hard, her spirit is very full. Dressed in the attire of a Bhikkhuni (nun), she appears extraordinarily simple and lovely. It is said that Zhang Cuihong will take a short break after "Guanyin" is finished.</p>
<p>Art China will plan another great work, taking the story of Cao Cao forcing the palace in Xiaoyaojin from a novel as the theme, which has considerable significance. It is said that the film will be titled "The Empress Fu's Vengeance."</p>
