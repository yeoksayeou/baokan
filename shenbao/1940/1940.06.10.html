<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本政局析觀</h3>
<p>日　日首相米內向新聞記者說明現內閣當前的對外政策，表示對於中國事件仍按照預定程序進行，對於歐戰則仍不變更其不參加政策，此外更無任何新的見解；但其言外之意，對於日本國內有一部份所謂革新分子的焦燥和叫囂　頗致不滿。足見米內此一表示，表面上不過將現內閣維持現狀的一貫路綫，重加說明，然近來日本政治意見的寵雜與政局的動盪，於此亦不難得到若干暗示。</p>
<p>日本自從發生「五一五」事變以來，日本政治久已脫出憲政常軌；政黨退到慕後，軍事法西斯勢力控制着政肘的一切，軍部是太上內閣，革新政客者流則趨炎附勢，推波助瀾，互相狼狽，彼此呼應；這種現象，若干年來直到現在，還是依然存在。與軍部對立的保守勢力，表面上固不能不聽任軍事法西斯橫行，實際却亦並　甘心退却；他們隨時在利用機會，準備伺隙蹈瑕以恢復其在政治上的比重。這一爭衡，蔚爲數年來日本政治動盪的主流；同時也就形成其政局不安的主　。固然，這只是日本統治階級內部的矛盾，致使日本內部團結力量大爲削弱，即在戰時，也無法獲致政情的安定。然就大體言之，此種內在的矛盾，並不影響其侵略立塲的一致。當「九一八」事變之際，日本對外侵略的副作用，輒爲促進內部團結的政略；但到最近，這一政略旣隨着侵華戰爭的持久和失敗而走到窮途。侵略戰爭冉也不夠刺激其國民的情緒，也再不能用以緩和內部的衝突；長期作戰的空前苦難籠罩了全國，國家財政的枯竭，工商百業的衰頹，人民的生活憔悴，都使早已潛伏着的社會危機更加深刻和擴大。這些現象，反映到政怡方面，就形成了軍部威熱的漸趨低落與保守陣營的企圖抬頭。米內內閣即是在此形勢之下產生的。蓋侵華戰事的失敗，對蘇挑釁的屈膝，德義路綫的慘遭遺棄，對外僵局的無法打開，都是促成日本軍事法西斯勢力降落的主要原因；米內內閣雖在這種形勢之下應運而生，然對於往日遺流下來的重重難關，却並不能比塌倒了的平沼阿部時代有更好的辦法。充其量只有竭力設法維持現狀，以蹈襲前閣政策爲能事。此其結果，必然使保守分子及一般國民感到失望。而革新者流則逐漸表示不耐。最近，歐陸戰局日見擴大，納粹軍事亦獲得初步勝利，日本政局因此外來的刺激，愈見擾攘；尤如新黨運動。久原建議，都表示着法西斯陣營已着手推進新的攻勢；這絕不是米內所作陳陳相因的政策報告所能消弭。軍部態度雖至今尙守緘默，而在已往的淺見丸問題與齋藤事件當中已向保守勢力小試其鋒；最近內大臣之由湯淺易爲木戶，無疑也是間接受軍部壓迫的結果；至現在爲止，僅見幾個革新政客之流掀起風波，一俟到達相當階段，軍部未必不直接出面，有如已往的傾覆阿部內閣一樣。</p>
<p>這種種波動，在他主觀上載爲促成政局的安定，但其客觀事實適成其爲政局小安中的主流，反而增進了日本政局的不安，却絕難收穫任何效果。三年以來。在日本內部實施過許多改造方案，何曾絲毫减輕自身的困難？所謂刷新政治機構，建立全國團結等類策動，如果在戰爭初期提出來，也許還有相當影響；現在日本朝野對於侵華戰爭早已失掉其自信，國民和士兵的意志也已被「和平」「收拾事變」一類口號所擾亂，在此際提出的革新方案，只是暴露了束手無策中的點綴。目前日本的苦悶是事實，無論是主持侵略的車閥，抑或只求生活下去的民衆，無不異常焦燥，感到前途異常的艱難而黯淡。日本朝野諸輩之中，當然也有比較明達的，體認到侵華戰爭是目前一切問題的根本癥結所在，却也絕對沒有人備具號召的資望，發爲揭穿的勇氣，也更無力進而尋求挽救方案。日當局口口聲聲準備結束中國事變，而實際上的措置却無往而不是使「事變」更加拖延，更加煩難；抑且明知拖延，明知煩難，還是不得不口口聲聲的準備結束中國事變；以自欺欺人來苟且搪塞，即如米內日前所談的對華方針就是一例。所謂革新者流固屬倒行逆施，任情妄爲，即在保守陣營又何嘗不是進退失據；同是甘受自然命運的支配，在根本上並無何種重大的歧異。日本今日的失敗，無論在軍事經濟外交任何方面都達到非常嚴重的階段，其統治者却始終缺乏遠大的眼光和認識，其唯一的作爲只是內　的明爭暗鬥，爭奪對政權的支配。現象若此，故無論此後日本政局是軍事法西斯的更見抬頭，抑或是保守陣營的抱殘守缺，他們所憧憬的，不外乎期待國際變局之中，有何夾縫，予以徼倖的機會；然其必然的最後結局，無非是在國際局勢的急劇演變中，終於自趨崩潰而已。</p>

<p>巴黎　此間軍界人士頃談稱、前綫戰事、愈演愈烈、迄至本日殆已達於極點、德軍在拉勃萊爾河與沃易斯河之間、傾其全力、向法軍陣地猛撲、其規模之大、實爲有史以來所僅見、此一路綫、長僅一百五十公里、但德方進攻之兵力、共有戰車四千輛、步兵五十萬名、自本日拂曉起即開始總攻、士兵在法軍機關槍及大砲猛烈射擊之下、摩肩接踵、密集進攻、亞眠城南面及洛亞城方面、法軍已於昨夜奉命撤退、德軍自該兩處乘勢推進、迫近法軍在奧瑪勒與諾雍兩城間所扼守之新陣地、（即在拉勃萊爾河左岸與沃易斯河右岸之間）即遭遇堅强抵抗、法國機關槍隊對此汹湧而來之「人浪」立即加以掃射、以致德方死傷枕籍、同時英法兩國飛機、亦在七十英尺之低空、用機關槍及炸彈襲擊德軍步兵及坦克車隊、頗爲得手、法國軍隊較之德軍雖衆寡懸殊、但仍在「無人區域」出奇突擊、一再反攻、卒使其所扼守之陣地、轉危爲安、迨至傍晚、德軍又復大舉進攻、法軍因無法抵抗，終於奉命作有秩序之撤退、此役德軍雖稍獲進展、但並未擊破法軍陣地、德軍在具他各處、亦曾作同樣之攻勢、例如在埃納河流域之進撲、亦與拉勃萊爾河沃易斯河區戰事、大致相同、其在某某數處地方業已進至埃納河沿岸、甚至巳於傍晚時搭有浮橋、意欲强渡、但法軍立即向下猛攻、將德軍擊退至索亞松城西面、至該城東面情形、與前日相同、德國戰車隊到達福爾奇萊索鎭近郊（該鎮在盧昂城東北面四十公里）之後、法軍旋即大舉反攻、並由空軍協助作戰、頗爲得力、加之該處地方河流縱橫、與諾曼第區森林地帶相鄰近、自不利於戰車活動、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間軍界人士頃談稱、本日爲前綫戰事最吃緊之一日、德方傾全力作戰、不惜任何代價、企圖獲致決定的勝利、全部員額、計在九十師至一百師之問、自沿海至亞爾哥納區、向法軍陣地猛烈進攻、在沿海至沃易斯河一綫約有四十師、在索亞松城附近、向埃納河進攻者、則有十師左右、在埃納河上游及香巴臬城附近、亦有四十師之譜、至於昨日戰爭結果、德軍所獲有限、實有得不償失之槪、其在索美河方面、經兩日戰爭之後、因死傷過多、不得不將第二批後備隊調往前綫作戰、要之、以昨日戰况而論、德軍在亞眠城南面、向南猛烈進攻、迨至傍晚時、戰事移至達爾特諾亞區、惟敵軍步隊之前進、至多不過十至十五公里、此外、埃納河上游、德軍在夏都波爾西盎城（在勒德爾城西面十公里）與歇納波比勒城（位於埃納河通至末斯河運河沿岸）間、廣四十公里之戰綫上、採取新攻勢、其戰車隊曾於本月七日、進抵福爾奇萊索鎭者、經法軍猛烈反攻之後、損失奇重、僅有少數部隊、在西南面稍有進展而已、（九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>德軍調集巨量兵力　後方交通綫受威脅</p>
<p>巴黎　此間主管人士頃談稱、德軍連日在法國北部所採取之猛烈攻勢、原欲予法軍以致命的打擊、並依照德軍參謀部所擬定之時間與地點、迫令法軍與之決戰、無如法軍統帥部申請已洞燭其奸、爰乃自動撤退、以避其鋒、而德軍作戰計畫、無從實現、綜計此决在前經所調動之步兵、不下五十萬名、坦克車不下四千輛、而其作戰之前綫則不過一百四十五公里、以如此狹隘之戰綫、竟動用如許重大之兵力、其欲孤注一擲、速戰速決之心理、實已不言可喻、不寗唯是、德軍於昨日渡過索美河之後、又將作戰陣錢、再度縮短、而避不向勃萊勒河進攻、蓋以該河流域、多爲沼澤地帶、德軍實不敢貿然前進故也、抑目下德軍後方之交通綫、已成一弧綫、德軍輜重隊、必須經過此狹長之走廊、始可到達前方、無如英國空軍根據地居其左、而法國陸空軍根據地、又居其右、在此種雙方夾擊之情形下、德軍接濟路綫、實受有莫大威脅、至以法軍作戰策略而言、其在抵抗德軍大規模攻勢時、雖不免有所損失、但以視德軍之重大損失、相去實不可以道里計、加以法軍因善於趨避之故、其實力於撤至新陣地時、依然完整無缺、正可以逸待勞、靜候德軍於喪失其精銳並相當深入之時、予以痛擊也、一言以蔽之、德軍此次所採大規模攻勢之目標、並未達到、連日雖小有進展、但損失慘重、得不償失、此之謂矣、不寗唯是、法軍今後實有改取主動地位之可能、何時改守爲攻、此際雖難預言、但一俟時機成熟聯軍總司令魏剛將軍、必能當機立斷、整隊出擊、要可斷言耳、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>法方分析戰爭形勢　德軍攻勢實力遞减</p>
<p>巴黎　昨晚法國官方發表作戰分析報吿稱、德國之坦克車及飛機、經此數日之激鬥、數量方面、已趨銳减、又據其他官方之文件　，設英法　國國內繼續積極生產、益以美國源源運來、則至七月中、英法兩國之空軍力量必可與德國並駕齊　、此法國報吿以爲英法兩國之飛機、若與德國相等、則英法空軍必可佔優勢、因就目前而觀、雖飛機數量、甚感缺乏、空戰則常獲勝利、是可知英法之航空員、技術殊爲佳良有優良之航空員、益以大量之飛機、空軍威力之足以凌駕實無待乎著龜、現在德國於物質方面、時遭重大損失、每日所喪失之坦克車、常在二百輛至四百輛之間、每日所喪失之飛機、當在四十架至六十架之間、據聞過去數日中被法國毀損之德國坦克車及飛機、均係直接自兵工廠驅入戰塲者、由是可知、德國之坦克車及飛機、國內已無餘額存備、自德侵波蘭以來之八個月中、德兵工廠爲補充被波蘭軍隊毀壞之坦克車及鐵甲車、幾經費力、始於補足損失以外、超出原額、德於開始侵略比國時、據法官方佔計、有坦克車及鐵甲車共五千輛、但其中半數、已被毀壞或失效用、嗣德國又自荷比兩　　取多量坦克車、由是遂使其能以三四千輛之坦克車進入索美戰塲矣、聞其中二千輛即於索美戰爭之第二日、驅出作戰、法國報吿繼稱、六百輛坦克車被毀後、德軍又以等量之新坦克車應戰、現在作　之德坦克車仍爲二千輛、其中若干輛已深入法軍陣綫後十五英里德國國內恐無餘量存留、（九目合衆電）</p>

<h3>歐戰初起時的一片「中立」聲（四）</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>（四）義大利的「不參加」（九月十八日於倫敦）</p>
<p>在基本的態度上，歐洲參戰國以外的各國彼此之間，是大有區別的，上面兩段，我大概地叙述了羅馬尼亞相土耳其的態度，羅土兩國，事實上，可以免强歸入一類，因爲在傾向上，很顯然，牠們是傾回着英法，這裏，要先叙述義大利，下一段，再述西班牙，道兩國，與羅土兩國剛剛相反，在傾向上，固然傾向着德國，而且進一步，我們不妨說，牠們是以「不參戰」的方式，而參加了德國對英法的戰鬥的，——尤其是義大利。</p>
<p>我再重複一句，義大利是以「不參戰」的姿態，而參加了德國對英法的戰爭。</p>
<p>本來，在一個單純的德，波戰裏，義大利的保守「中立」，在戰前的那些天，大家是早已可以判斷出來了，然而，萬一英法和德國間宜了戰時，義大利的態度，將如何呢？這，在二十天前，是誰也不敢斷定的事，同時，也是大家最關心着的一個疑問。</p>
<p>那樣的時候，在疑雲重重裏德義閒，却加緊了外交的接觸。於是謠言就隨之更加風起雲湧了起來。那其中，最令英法担心的一個傳說，是說着，萬一英法和德國宜戰時，義大利的軍隊，會立刻由阿爾卑斯山攻進法國去，而作爲這一傳說旁證的，却是義軍在波河流域一帶的大量集中。</p>
<p>於是，英法方面，也就開始了對義大利的外交活動。主要的意思，是在探詢出，在英法對德宜戰的塲合下，義大利的大概態度。可是探詢的結果，却是不得要領。</p>
<p>接着德波問之戰；又接着英法與德國開了戰。</p>
<p>這樣一來，於是到了義大利參戰與否的一個最緊要關鍵上了。</p>
<p>那時候，雖是在德國一面，希特勒曾有過暫時不需要　利參戰的話；但在英法這一面呢，據我們照當時的種種表現來推斷，大概縱使義大利參戰，英法也準備加以應付的。所以，在並沒有獲得義大利不加入的保證之前，英法就冒了與德意兩國作戰的險，而逕直對德宣了戰，並且同時對義大利也取了種種預防舉措，最令人注目的，首先是英，法海軍的遍佈地中海，其次是英，法陸軍的紛紛向非洲和近東增防。</p>
<p>然而，就在這千鈞一髮的當兒，英，法外交　了九牛二虎之力而得不到一點端倪的義大利的態度，這時，却在另外一些事上，逐漸地，開始流露了出來：（一）爲了防備空中夜襲而施行的燈火管制，忽然鬆懈了，有些地方甚至解除了。（二）在義大利谷城市中趕築起來的防空室，忽然之間，又開始了普遍的拆卸。（三）酒館子，俱樂部的開放時間，恢復了常態，夜生活又恢復了。（四）義法邊境，曾經一時封閉過，現在，父重行開放了，（五）停頓了的東歐的國際通車，也完全復了舊，西至巴黎，東至巴爾幹，而中間經過義大利。（六）義大利航行地中海與洋面上的各條航綫，不獨復了舊，而且加緊了營業，且抬高了市價，比如到遠東去的船價，就一律差小多加了一倍。……</p>
<p>在一個短短的三五天之內，同時發生了上面這些信手舉來的瑣事，是決非偶然的現象。牠在說明着一件重要的事，義大利目前決小至於參戰。——如果估計得精密一點，大槪在一九四〇年春季以前，牠是不至於採取戰爭行動的。</p>

<p>特警問題</p>
<p>談及越界築路「特警問題、傳支吾其詢、對「特警」成立日期、僅稱、「希望於最近期內成立」、惟表示在越界築路警權問題解決前、似尙有其他問題若干項、雙方意見、尙未獲一致、</p>

<h3>意輪康鐵佛田今日移泊浮筒　承裝客貨決定辦理退關　在滬將作相當時期停留</h3>
<p>意國郵船公司康鐵佛田號輪、奉羅馬政府命令、所有在中途行駛之意郵、一律停泊中立國口岸後、該輪即中止駛返歐洲、現悉該倫定於今日由虹口公和祥碼頭改泊浦江浮筒、此後行止雖未決定、而所有承裝載往歐洲之客貨、公司方向決定分別退票退關、茲經新聲社記者續誌各情如次、</p>
<p>移泊浮筒</p>
<p>康戴佛田輪、自奉命暫泊中立國口岸待命後、公司方面昨日已正式通吿改期啟椗、並謂俟確定日期後、再行通吿、昨日該輪截至晚間爲止、仍泊虹口公和祥碼頭、惟據該公司負責人稱、公司當局以該處係英商碼頭、決定今日將該輪改泊浦江浮筒、再靜待命令、</p>
<p>退票退關</p>
<p>關於該輪業已接洽承裝運往香港南洋及歐洲各埠之貨物、及巳售出之客票、公司方面因即使奉命駛離上海、亦不至按照原定航綫、在沿途各國停靠、故已決定將所有貨運、分別退關、客票亦予退還、該項通知、將於一二日內見諸公吿、至日前運載來滬之貨物一百餘噸、業已起卸完唆</p>
<p>暫不離滬</p>
<p>至該輪此後行蹤、意圖郵船公司於日前接已去電羅馬政府、請示機宜、昨然截至昨晚爲止、公司方面尙未接得覆電、故該輪此後停泊何處、尙不能決定、據一般觀察、該輪如駛離上海、勢必經過香港及南洋英屬各地、目前航行、固不至有何阻碍、但與停泊中立國口岸之命令、未能吻合、故該倫或將在滬作相當時期之停留、</p>
<p>改用美金</p>
<p>另據航業界息、　國郵船目歐洲局勢轉緊以後、航行美洲及遠東方面之意郵、其輪上使用之幣制、已不用意幣而改用美金、此次康鐵佛田號輪由歐啟椗、對於客人購買船票、一律須以美金票購買、來華船資、統艙票售美金一百七十元、合華幣三千餘元、其昂貴前所未有，在輪上買賣食物、亦採用美金、意幣已不能適用、據船員稱、因公司方面向各地採辦物品、亦須以美金購買故也、</p>
<p>船長表示</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日文「大陸新報一載稱、意郵船康脫佛田號原定九日離滬駛回意國熱諾亞者、頃已展緩駛出、將從英商公和祥碼頭改靠日商碼頭、無限期停泊據該船船長吿「大陸新報」記者稱、意貨船雖將維持定期航行、惟駛滬之意國載客船、殆以康脫佛田號爲最後一艘、至於該船停止起航、在政治上涵何意義、渠不能置論、亦未便說明渠是吾相信該船停航、爲義國行將參戰之表示、今各事胥操意相墨索里尼之手、意國人民、準備從其領袖之命令、</p>

<p>在中國領海以內行駛之意商航輪、現仍照常行駛、意商中意公司德平輪、已於昨日午後五時、離滬駛往鎮海、據悉此種航倫、因在中立國領海內行駛、情形不同、故意國即使參戰、恐亦不受任何影響、一若在華行駛之德商航輪然、將照常開航、</p>

<p>似頗曖昧</p>
<p>日方迄今所抱　度、為英國苟欲封銷撤消則應轉變其對　個華北問　之政策而與日人推誠合作、日陸軍省則謂日方對撤消封鎖事、一般皆有暫時不置可吾之傾向、欲求解決之點、不</p>
<p>租界存銀而已、蓋日方並求英國之合作也、英大使館發言人亦稱、渠對封鎖撤消事、　以斷言、　租界存銀確數、亦未斷定、封鎖　不撤消、則白銀問題、　吿商妥仍屬不得　　、</p>
<p>雙方談判</p>
<p>當然已　倫敦與巴黎方面　力於歐戰　延宕、然目下　在進行中觀於局勢之困難、日方態度確見緩加、雙方提　中之協定、　規定交出英租界價値英金十萬鎊　存銀及法租界價値二十萬　之存銀用以</p>

<h3>蘇敎廳改進戰時地方及初等社敎（二）對論陷各縣恢復敎育行政機構</h3>
<p>至廿八年度上學期、石湖鄕師附小如師附小甫通小學均先後自行復課、但各校設校地點如何方可適中、設級級數如何切合需要、應就各地實際情形、重加調整、蘇敎廳爰於本學期之始、將省立淮師如師海師界首鄕師石湖鄉師早堰鄉師各附小南通蘆村各小學、一律易名爲省立第一至第八臨時小學、斟酌地方情形、變更設校地點、規定級數、復於徐屬增設省立第九臨小一所、並訂定江蘇省立臨時小學設置辦法及中心工作大綱頒行各校、以資遵守、</p>
<p>（四）舉辦小學敎師訓練班曁戰區小學敎師訓練團、蘇省初等敎育原有深厚之基礎、惟自戰事發生而後、敎師因逃亡流徙、師資多不整齊、其中因服務多年精神不振者、固所在多有、而因資歷不充濫竽充數者、亦事實所不能免、蘇教廳有鑒及此、兼以推行國民敎育、亟須先事準備、於是爲求小學師資質的改進、小學敎育精神刷新計、特訂定各縣小學敎師訓練班暫行辦法及戰區各縣小畢敎師巡迴訓練團暫行辦法令行各縣遵辦、對於敎師一律施以短期訓練、增進其抗戰建國敎育之效能、藉以改進全省各縣之小學且爲推行國民敎育之準備、此舉於各縣敎育前途實有重大之關係（五）恢復東台大豐墾區義敎實騐區、東台大豐墾區義敎實騐區、在民二十六年、原由蘇敎廳派員主持、嗣抗戰軍興東台十度淪陷、日軍侵擾墾區各鎭、該區逼於情勢、暫行停頓、所有墾區敎育悉由該縣敎育局負責管理、但該區僻處海濱、敎育局管理不便、蘇敎廳爲適應需要起見、特將該義敎實騐區恢復、已於三月間將瞥理委員會組織成立、並委派前東台敎育局長季眞如爲該區主任、從此該區　敎可逐漸　序擴充矣</p>
<p>（六）積極推行義務敎育、查本年度蘇北各縣　務學級已經增設者、的一十餘縣、其新增級數、爲六五七、在淪陷區域無法設立義務學級者、即鼓勵地方人士設立義塾、以實施義務敎育、按其成績予以補助、</p>
<p>（七）統一改進私塾敎育、蘇省各縣私塾在戰前官廳方面即多方設法取締、迄今各縣私塾數並未能如何减少、其實私塾如果管理得宜、亦未始不可化窳爲良、易枳爲橘、盡舉私塾改爲合乎標準之初小或義小、誠一轉移間事、蘇敎廳於本學期特頒「江蘇省各縣統一改進私塾敎育計劃大綱」、以積極改進全省各縣之私塾敎育，而收輔助義務敎育之實效、又訂定各縣輔導私塾暫行辦法曁各縣塾師訓練班暫行辦法、預計本年暑假後不獨各縣私塾敎育之進步可期而大多數塾師經訓練後、必可儲爲將來推行國民敎育保敎師資之用、誠一舉而兩得也、</p>
<p>（八）調整各縣小學敎帥、大戰以來、蘇北各縣小學師資、往往供求不能適合、大槪受戰禍較重之縣、小學敎師每不易求得相當工作、蘇敎廳有鑒及此、爲謀各縣小學敎師供求適合、分配均衡起見、特訂定「調整各縣小學敎師暫行辦法」、於每學期開始前、各縣敎育局科應將全縣小學敎師舉行總登記、並儘量任用各該縣所有之合格敎師、如小敷用、將所缺之師資報廳、以便統籌分配、施行以來、各縣師資、已無過剩或不足之現象</p>
<p>（九）籌劃推行國民敎育、自中央規定本年八月起實施國民敎育、蘇敎廳遵照敎育部規定步驟、積極準備、計已進行者、（一）印發敎育部頒國民敎育實施綱領、（二）製定表式調查全省各縣人口數、鄉鎮保數·校數·級數·學生數、經費及師資等要項、限期塡表、（三）擬訂江蘇省實數國民敎育計劃」、呈報敎育部備核、規定五年實施國民敎育之步驟、一面父擬訂訓練及培養師資計劃以期大量儲佛師資、而爲分期推行國民敎育之準備</p>
<p>（十）編印小學抗戰敎材、蘇北各縣因與滬方交通梗阻、各縣學校於耗學期開學之始、學生需用課本、幾於無法供應、除少數輾轉委託書坊設法購備外、餘多自行油印、或委託印刷所代印、又課本內容往往失去時代意義、不切目前需要、查蘇敎廳原設有編審室、於本學期由該廳編審室着手編輯、小學抗戰敎材、最近已編竣者、有小學中年級秋季用國語常識課本及高級國語社會敎科書、現已令知各縣、並調查各縣需要冊數、以便統計付印、該編審室除已編製上項課本外、又審核各縣呈送民衆識字課本多種、工作頗爲緊張、</p>

<p>李受祿　兄弟曾經接到一張出口定單後，向華商銀行請求放款，他們說：「套買外匯的利息，比放款的利息大得多」，所以不肯。相反的外商銀行，有時候還肯幫我們一些忙；這個問題的解決，除非有政府的命令。出口事業之發展，除非得到華商銀行的幫助。</p>
<p>呂錫麟　銀行信用放款，並非絕對不做；所以不能大量做，銀行亦自有許多困難的地方，因為上海金融變動甚劇，許多出後風險甚大，故銀行對於一般工商界之信用放款、不得不略事緊縮。至於與銀行往來歷史較久的人家，還是照做；工商界責銀行不放款，其實是寃枉的，銀行而不放款是絕對不可能的，入超多則外匯縮；但是現在外匯縮的原因，並不是完全為了入超多的關係，大半是為了投機、投機不息，金融便不能安定；金融不安定，銀行便不能大量放款；所以問題的中心，就是銀行界「不結遠期外涸」給投櫗家，不結遠期外匯，投機可以减少；可是在這特殊環境之下，是不容易辦到的。</p>
<p>甘斗南　促進貿易，必須銀行幫助，才能發展，出口貿易是外國向我們定的，已經來定了，就是中國人不做，外商洋行也是要做，外商做外滙便落在外國人手裏，所以出口事業，非中國人直接和外國人做不可，直接做便非銀行幫助不可，買進生產必須之原料，顯與投機囤積情形不同。</p>
<p>促進貿易與國貨界</p>
<p>主席　諸位對於促進貿易與金融界在關係，已討論很詳細，現在已論到國貨界。請大家由國貨製造與國產原料販賣等立塲，討論我國國際貿易的利弊，困難，和解決的方法。</p>
<p>張一凡　國貨廠商用的是國貨原料，便無外匯不穩的風險；借款用途，是不是買原料？所以由銀行向採辦商調查；或於廠商收到原料之後直接由銀行代付貨款；或由原料商介紹銀行放借；假定國貨原料沒有或雖有而不够，向外國云買不可，也可以調查；如果恐受外匯變動發生損失，而不放款，這似乎說不過去。</p>
<p>兪仲葵　金融界本身，確有其困難；定期存款减少，活動存款增加，銀行不得不充分準備。所以放款甚難；工廠界困難，銀行也困難，對於存款須付利息，而準備部份還要賠息</p>
<p>張一凡　如廠家因原料進口、不妨直接向銀行借外匯；將來還也還外匯，則彼此都可方便</p>
<p>呂錫麟　各商業銀行都在這樣做。</p>
<p>甘斗南　金融界困難，確是事實，所以一定要由方來想法。總之：中國廠商的借款，應由華商銀行做。若外商銀行可以做，而自巳反不能帮助，未免笑話？</p>
<p>李受祿　外商銀行可以做，中國銀行反不能做的原因，是為了外商對存款利息小，甚至不給息。華商銀行利息普遍極大，像活期週息四厘；定期七厘，……</p>
<p>兪仲葵　存戶可以隨時用活期存款投機，但銀行不能以之放款，而銀行本身也要做生意才能維持。</p>
<p>游伯羣　這都是環境關係，根本沒有辦法。</p>
<p>主席　各方面都有其內在的困難。我想趁此講一個笑話。五月二號那天，外匯暴縮。各商店爭先恐後，將貨價頓時提高數成。因此大家表示不滿，認為商人故意操縱，為害社會。但另據商店方面意見，認為外匯一縮，大衆必爭先購囤貨物，商店如不將物價提高，則必至存貨被購一空，陷於無貨可賣之境。這樣顧客怪店家高抬時價，店家怪顧客搶貨囤積。誰楚誰非，難以辯認。然在事實上大家都有不對的地方。我們今天很高興，大家都能出於赤誠詳細討論。所以我們對於工商界金融界彼此的困難，多一層的瞭解。不過我以為要國貨廠商和進出口事業發展，非得到余融界的援手不可。而金融方面欲求正當的出路，又有賴於工商業的繁榮。所以在大家都有其困難情形下，還要多想些積極的方法，來互相了解，互相扶助，以達到互相的利益才好。</p>
<p>兪仲葵　這也是買貨人的不好，根本不能怪商店漲價，因為不漲價，店裹的東西給人家買去，叫他怎樣繼續營業，商店除關店大拍賣外，售價總須較　時進貨價稍高。</p>
<p>促進貿易與進出口事業</p>
<p>主席　現在討論促進貿易與進出口事業，請大家由進出口商立塲，海外消費者立塲，海外進出口立塲，發表高見。</p>
<p>馮恒勤　關於提倡出口押匯，不佞於民國二十二年間，即為文主張：金融業應盡量予出口商家以特殊之融通。共辦法如：（一）墊頭，利　，手　　等，當　進口　匯量予　　（二）　請求國外分行或代理銀行，將委託行所做出口押匯貨物之銷塲趨勢，用客觀的眼光觀察，隨時繕具詳細報告，俾轉達出口商家，得以知所改進。</p>
<p>現在非但出口押匯應予扶助；即進口押匯，為促進生產起見，對於正當國貨廠商，在國外採辦原料等，金融業亦應予以便利；惟戰後整個上海市塲，已為囤貨投機勢力所籠罩；金融業對於進出口商家，雖已有一部份融通，但事實上進出口商，因貿易額之龐大，所望於金融業之接濟者甚大；究宜如何雙方合作？盡量調劑？斯誠當前極值得討論之問題。就不佞個人感想所及，目前似有下列兩項辦法可供研究：</p>
<p>（一））金融業宜收束普通貨物等放款，集中投資於進出口貿易；其辦法：（一）對於普通有投機性之各種貨物等放款，一律收回不放；俾得到一部份資金，可資運用。同時物價，亦得以相當下落。（二）對於日用生活必需品之放款，如米煤等，應以公共組織之團體出面集資辦理。不得由私人或普通商號向銀錢業商做押款，以免操縱囤積之弊。（三）對凡與正當進出口貿易有關之資金融通，不論押匯押款，均盡量承做，予以便利。</p>
<p>（二）金融業宜辦特種信託金，以運用於進出口貿易為對象，其辦法：（一）金融業按照信託投資辦法，收集特種信託金，以備運用於進出口貿易，（一）此項信託金，規定保息若干，其運用所得之利益，以一部份為進出口貿易商所得，一小部份為銀行所得，其餘完全均為信託人所得，（三）此項信託金，由一銀行辦可，由數銀行會同辦理亦可，（四）金融業投資於進出口商之辦法，隨時分別按照實際情形洽辦之。</p>
<p>以上僅為不佞個人一時之擬議，似乎一種空想，茲事體大，似宜由金融業與進出口商家，有一相當組織，方可從長計議，是否敬請各位指敎。</p>
<p>汪孚禮　鄙人對於第三項，有欲加以說明之處：即銀行界對於工商業，並非不肯放款，不過因其地點而有所不同，上海方面，殆等於淪陷區域：政府固不願隨意放款，間接為他人繁榮，但在內地，不獨照常放款，且較戰前放款條件為莧，其利率亦不加大，就鄙人所知者而言：工鑛調整處曾由政府銀行撥款三千萬元以為扶助工商業之用；又中國工業合作社最近亦借到二千萬元；此外金業家技術家凡有切實計劃，足以助長後方之生產者，經過審查合格，無不貸以相當資金；甚至加以補助，此種事實，彰彰在人耳目，敬請熱心事業諸先生，各向內地勇往邁進，不為上海一隅所拘束焉可！</p>
<p>鄙人對於第四項，覺得促進對外貿易，固屬相當重要，但國內貨物如不敷用，必先從充實國貨着手，試就棉紗一項而論，全世界的有紡錠一億六千萬枚，而全世界人口的為十六億，平均每十人應配紡錠一枚，我國人口為四億五千萬，照此攤派，應有四千五百萬枚紡錠，在世界上方不吃虧，八·一三戰事未發生時，我國亦祗有紡錠二百八十萬枚，已屬大不敷用，今則所存者不到七十萬錠；試問衣被問題，如何嚴重？際此非常時期，交通多阻，要從國外輸入大批機器，在後方多多設廠，絕非易事，不得已祇好在國內另想他法以補充之，現內地盛行帶有機械性之手紡，如七七紡，三一紡，印度紡，業精式紡　，風起雲湧，實為時勢所促成，亦一補救之良法，鄙人曾會同數同志從事研究，近亦得成一種「超大牽伸小型紡紗機」，取名「新農式」，現正大批製造，成績甚佳定貨擁擠，將來對於斯業，當有相當之補助，至其詳細內容，緩常為文以論之，此就國內貨物之不敷用者，而舉一例於此，並非謂可忽視</p>
<p>其一切對外貿易也。</p>
<p>高事恒　切我想這個問題，和各方面都有一點聯帶關係；就一般講；各方面都有困難；政府有政府的困難，余融界有金融界困難，廠商有廠商的困難，貿易商有貿易商的困難；我們要知道上海這地方，從政府立塲講：已並不十分重要；但是從上海五百萬人的塲講：覺得上海是人才發源地，全國余融中心；將來的國際貿易還是不能脫離上海；所以非將上海產業好好的保持不可！處於道種矛盾情形之下，所以我們的處境非常艱苦；生活程度如此高，這不僅一部份人的痛苦，是全上海人的痛苦；雖然　般人買賣美金而致富，可是他們的內心也未必一定快樂</p>
<p>銀行方面，我們責備他；為什麽外　銀行可以做的，如押滙貼現等？中國的銀行到反不肯給我們帮助？但他們亦自有其苦衷；例如剛才兪先生講的，商業銀行因活期存款增加，定期存款减少，也是不能大量放款的事實；國家銀行方面，則因為政府不願意讓資金留在上海，如果到內地去經營，那就非常歡迎你！各銀行也會儘量給你便利！</p>
<p>現在國貨廠商還談不到向外發展！這一點，剛才注先生說：「因為外銷，所以使物價提高」。但上海高漲的原因根本不是貨物少，完全是人心的關係；須知南洋一帶有八百萬華僑，他們都歡迎國貨，尤其是外滙關係，上海的東西，比較那邊還要便宜；所以那邊的國貨交易，正有山陰道上應接不暇之勢。我們祇要能吃苦能積極，不但南洋需要，就是其他國家也需要我們的東西。</p>
<p>「我們」的不能放棄上海，因為上海是我國的根據地；但是應如何才能發展對外貿易呢？結果還是要金融界合作，世界各國如　美日，他們的海外貿易，都可以大批放帳；而中國人獨不能放；這樣豈不是有很大的影響？他們為什麽能放而我便不能放呢？這就他們得到了國家銀行與商業銀行的帮助，而我們不沒有；就是有也是很少。須知我們得到的滙票，也就是外滙的收人。</p>
<p>國外的消費者，都是歡迎我們中國貨；祇要質量合乎標準。但是國際貿易要如何發展？是各方面都有連帶關係的。最要緊的是金融界與實業界間，研究出一種變方有利方法，使吾們的國際貿易能蒸蒸日上！</p>
<p>汪孚禮　近來國貨界同志，對此問題。屢加研究，頗擬做到下列三事，特轉述之，以供各位之參考。（一）請政府禁做期貨交易，以免投機；（二）請政府發滙劃一萬萬元，以資上海實業界之週轉；（三）法律制裁凡做期貨交易者，不受法律上之保護。</p>
<p>柯天斧　近來國貨在海外銷路，日形擴展。但我國船業，殊為落後。至於歐美船隻，受戰事影響，來華數目日少一日。恐怕將來「有貨而無船可運」之情形。或會發生。希望政府予以相當注意。關於華僑投資祖國一層。政府應予以種種便利與指導。……</p>
<p>尾聲</p>
<p>主席　今天的座談會自上午十時起，現在已下午四時了。承各界領袖撥冗寵臨，牲了很長很寳貴的時間，發表高見。如何促進我國國際貿易，處此國內外戰爭狀態下，將來的事情，都要依將來的環境變化為轉移。當然誰亦不能預定一個不移的政策。但我們在今天各界領袖所發表的宏論中。對於國際貿易與銀行，外滙，船費，國貨商，進出口商，海外市塲，政府與人民合作等問題，已有確切的認識。這就是促進我國國際貿易所必經的途徑。今天的紀錄，除將由申報經濟專刊於六月三日，及十日分別發表外，敝公司出版之日用經濟月刊亦將出一國際貿易專號。申報經專與敝公司發起這次促進國際貿易座談會，目的只在拋磚引玉。希望各界領袖，隨時努力，將我國國際貿易，導入坦途，使工商業有正當的發展，金融有正當的出路而國計民生，能交受其利。　（完）</p>

<h3>呢羢客銷之轉移</h3>
<p>— 峯</p>
<p>民國十四年後、呢羢客銷突然轉移、汕厦廣東帮採辦均見退化、據說大半均改向香港購解所致、大連帮需要者多係轉口貨、蓋在滬已付過關稅之呢羢、裝運大連、可向海關牧回所付之稅餉、即所謂存栗是現在此種存某早已取消、故該帮駐　申莊、九十收歇、而渝蓉川帮、採購力則比前轉强、平津靑　烟威長江帮、南人經營者、多春秋二季親自來申選辦、春季帶購夏貨、秋季帶購冬貨、北人經營者、以天津華行與敦慶隆二家生意最大、（天華行申莊為彼所創辦）、因其各貨裝津後、再行專銷與各　小客帮也、</p>
<p>十六年北伐統一、奠都南京、呢羢客銷復大轉移、昔日採購微細之南京·蘇州·杭州·金華·溫州·寗波等內地帮、銷路均突轉暢旺、尤以南京帮特殊廣盛、同時關東帮銷　銳落、海上洋行家多分設津行、致天津帮多直接訂定、向申採辦者驟稀、而長沙·漢口·南昌帮銷路則俱轉有進展、此時華南帮申莊多紛紛收歇、黔滇川帮進胃轉健、</p>
<p>廿　年「一二八」戰後、呢羢客銷自然又告大變、雖不久戰事結束、但北帮已大受打擊、關東帮莊客、都離申北上、上海著名之北帮商棧如永豐利·益順恒·益順盛等、都相率改組、該帮客銷突减一半、但川·滇·黔·浙·湘」贛。鄂諸省、客銷則仍在增旺中、因此呢羢客路的行銷、平均並未見弱、且有過之而無不　、</p>
<p>廿六年「八一三」滬戰爆發、全面抗戰、激烈進展、交通運輸不便、呢羢客銷、自不免大受打擊、郵局句裹、忽通忽停、運到時日、因轉輾寄遞、遲慢多多、以致客帮雖巳將存貨售罄、急欲向申購辦、而被環境逼迫、勢有不能、當武漢未失陷前、轉道浙贛路推銷者頗衆、其後時事變遷游擊區域漸廣、水陸交通煩阻更甚、全國客銷行急轉直下、客帮商棧大川通遂告收閉、祥裕公改為祥譽公、怡和渝改為志昌祥、永豐利改組、尙有新張之北恒茂與一新、形成新陳代謝之勢、</p>
<p>在此長期抗戰中、統觀呢羢客銷、各路莫不大减、新近稍稍活躍者、　北平·天津二帮、次為雲南四川幫、次為南　幫、浙省溫州金華寗波幫亦尙不寂寞、惟較之「八一三」前平均减少十分之六、就目前之局面而論、客銷自難進展、但本街銷塲、反因孤島人口激增、銷費大增、超過未戰前一半有餘、故呢羢業之目光、刻多移注於本街交易而對客幫營業暫時似不予重視矣、（完）</p>

<h3>廓爾喀內附源流考（二）</h3>
<p>廓爾喀人短小強狠，戶口約百餘萬，自古不通中國。雍正九年，始以金葉表文貢方物。乾隆五十五年三月，始聽後藏班禪喇嘛之弟舍瑪爾巴煽惑，利後藏封殖，興兵犯邊。唐古特兵不能遏禦，告急於中朝，而所遣援剿之侍衛巴忠將軍鄂輝成德等，復調停賄和，陰令西藏堪布等，私許歲幣萬五十金，按兵不戰，擅以賊降飾奏，諷廓酋入貢受封。七月，廓爾喀遣人至藏表貢，並致駐藏大臣書，請如前約，鄂輝恐事發覺，屏不奏。次年藏中歲幣復爽約，廓酋以責負為名，再興兵闖入後藏札什倫布地方，駐藏大臣保泰聞賊至，則移班禪於前藏，並張皇賊勢，奏請移達賴於西寗，移班禪於泰寗，欲以藏地委賊。刺麻濟仲札蒼等，復託言卜諸吉祥天母，不宜戰，眾心遂潰，賊乃大掠札什倫布，全藏大震！兩大剌麻，飛章告急，時鄂輝為四川總督，成德為四川將軍，盡以罪委之巴忠。上命二人赴藏剿禦，又按程緩進。</p>

<h3>紀丁氏之粥會</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>昔賢之嗜粥者多矣，如盧澄之栗繼，陸游之芋粥，東坡之淡粥，香山之　粥。且有煮以桃花，熬以梅蕊，屑桂　薑，舂秔煮豆者；而我丁仲祜前輩澤古功深，而於此雙弓之米，尤稱竺嗜。而推其所好，以粥會友，每星期一之晚，必舉行一次，凡數十年，從無間輟，其持恒不息之精神，實堪欽敬。予於上星期一，亦曾一度參加焉。長幼畢集，士女雜坐，有畫師，有書家，有詩人，有詞客，有岐黃之流，有鑒賞之輩，可謂濟濟多才，翩翩裙屐，來賓必署名於冊，並居址及生年月日亦詳列焉；冊端書有約言，有云：「星一會中，弗尙虛禮，不迎客來，不送客往，賓主無間，坐立無序，直率爲約，簡素爲具，代飯以粥，代茶以水，閒談古今，靜玩書畫，不言是非，不論官事，行立坐臥，忘形適意，冷淡家風，林泉淸致，道義之交，如斯而已，羅列腥羶，周旋布置，內非眞誠，外徒矯僞，關利害，反目相視，此世俗交，吾斯屛棄。」蓋仿司馬溫公之眞率會，而參用其辭意也，室中銅佛瓷盎，符采彪炳，極古色古香之致。正談笑間，而侍者來設席，席凡二，衆團坐之，陳碟八，皆淸雋之品，令人作仙家胡麻之想，仲老與予同席，謂久不進魚肉，若恣意肉食，必致血管變硬，血壓轉高，是慢性之中毒，奈世人之不戒饕餮何，食以蔬類爲美，如大豆番茄捲心菜等，最富滋養，而晨午必啖果，丹橘黃蕉，日以十餘枚計，寗少淮粥飯，而不廢果菰，此健康之道也；又　鹽足以刺激腎臟，食過量之鹽，能使腎臟機能逐漸减退，又營養不足，可使人身體贏瘦，缺乏氣力，但營養過賸，亦同一有害，使人早老早卒，所謂過猶不及也。予曰，是眞一夕話勝十年書，仲老爲之莞爾，及散，廛戶悉閉，市聲漸寂矣。</p>
<h3>推薦幾種夏季衣料</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>夏季衣料，首該注意輕淸飄逸，但輕淸飄逸，無形中便給舶來品佔據了夏季衣料的整個市塲。其實國產絲綢也不乏備具這種條件的，當現在這個凡百騰漲，無論綢布每尺價格都得在二三元以上的時候，平心而論，我覺得盛紡還有推薦的價値：</p>
<p>電力紡　電力紡，是盛紡中近年來唯一的新出品，它的原料，過去都採用廠絲做經緯，故身地緊密薄潔，光滑平秀，爲盛紡諸綢之冠，戰後，因廠絲價昂，經緯都已改用土絲，在看相上似乎已差了些，但其輕淸飄逸，經洗耐穿，却並不因之遜色，用以裁製長短衫褲，襯衫褲之類，最爲合宜，闊度二十二寸，每尺價格至多不過一元二三角，以視璧縐印度綢等等，便宜多多。</p>
<p>光扣紡　其次是光扣紡，電力紡是用電機織造的，而光扣紡則完全係由木機人工織成。故品質與身地，二者實無分軒輊。不過光扣紡綢面的匀凈與光潔，不如電力紡之漂亮而已，盛紡優點，在乎身地愈洗愈細密，色調愈洗愈文雅，光扣紡於此，却較電力紡爲優，闊度與電力紡差不多，每尺價格一元左右，四五口之家，化五十塊錢買一疋光　紡，已足够夏令衣服而有餘，更有各色條子與格子的，花式搭嵌文靜，尤其適合於婦女。</p>
<p>生紡　夏令穿綢衣服，出了汗似乎會感到膩煩，拷綢雖無此弊，但價格之貴，殊令人望而却步，那麼生紡至少可以彌補這缺憾。生紡用條紋較細的經緯所組成，頭紋與分兩雖不若上述二者之滯重，但不經煉熟，較諸粗鬆的夏布萬載布，仍很細密。每尺價格不過五六角，雖然闊度較狹，不過一尺五寸，但用以裁製襯衫，其凉快爽適，確與拷綢無殊。</p>
<h3>談蚊帳</h3>
<p>— 沈錫身</p>
<p>時交夏令，已是蚊蟲肆虐的季候了，尤其在晚上睡覺的時候，蚊蟲會在你耳鼓旁發出一種嗡嗡之聲，不但擾人淸夢，並且吮吸我們的血液，傳佈病菌；眞是一種可惡的小東西，而是人類健康上的一重威脅。</p>
<p>要解除這重威脅，惟有在床上掛一頂蚊帳，睡時把蚊帳放下，使蚊蟲飛來，無從入口，而你却可在帳內酣臥了。</p>
<p>蚊帳的效用，在上海和一般內地頗有些差別；在上海，蚊帳是完全用作避拒蚊蟲用的，所以除了夏秋兩季外，平日却很少見有人在床上張用；因爲嫌它阻礙空氣，不合睡時的衛生，式樣大都採用西式的圓頂，白天不用時可以高高捲起，晚上臨睡時才把他放下來籠罩床的全部，但在各處內地，一般人是常年地把他掛在床上應用的；那是我國固有的式樣；長方形而適合床的尺度，正面分作兩頁，狀如幃幔，以便出入，除了夏季防禦蚊蟲外，因爲內地都是舊式房屋，有的屋子上沒有天花板，瓦磚畢露，灰塵飛揚；有的墙單板薄，陽光和風雨也許會從縫隙中侵襲進來；晚間入睡全賴帳幔爲之掩護，不像上海的一般西式房屋，墙壁這樣堅厚，把門窗緊閉後可和外界隔離得密不通風，當然不需床上再掛蚊帳了</p>
<p>蚊帳的質料，中式的大槪是用洋紗，夏布，竹布，珠羅紗等裁製的，西式的則多採用珠羅紗；當然珠羅紗是最適宜的，能透凉通風，合乎衛生之道！</p>
<h3>航行黃河上游的皮筏</h3>
<p>— 海之奇</p>
<p>西北的水上交通，皮筏是最普遍的一種。因爲地理環境的關係，西北不利於農耕，利於畜牧。他們最容易取到的，是畜生身上的東西。他們就用牛皮或羊皮，造成航行的工具。製造皮筏的方法十分簡單，時期却相當的長。他們第一步先將牛羊皮袋，經過長期的油浸，然後緊束頭尾四肢，把空氣灌注進去，以幾個，十多個或數十百個，編成平面，　方形，上面　了木架子，木架上就可以搭客或載貨。這樣的皮筏，載重最多的，可以裝到一萬多斤的重量。</p>
<p>每一隻皮筏上，都有水手操縱着。依着筏的大小，水手也有多少。水手叫「把式」，分掌前後各槳，其中的一個是領袖，叫做「拿事」做領袖的必須久走江河，深習水性，而且是機警果斷的人物。這些苦力，大多數是甘肅河州的回民，不吃鴉片的，身體堅賞而有力富有責任心，足够擔當這艱苦的任務。他們中間，有一種叫「峽把式」，更是精通水性，熟悉水紋的老手。原來黃河經過甘肅省，自蘭州以下，離城六七十里以後，有長六十里的「大峽」，河面非常狹窄，水急而有巨灘，和近乎直角的轉彎處。於是產生了一種專門駕馭「大峽」一段險水爲職業的水手，叫做「峽把式」的。</p>
<p>皮筏航行黃河裏，在平流地方，完全看水紋而行。選擇水紋主流的所在地，使筏航行其上。因爲主紋的水較深，而速度也快，沒有擱淺的危險。所以皮筏碰到風雨，是最討厭的一件事，水紋一亂，皮筏只有停止前進。這種落後的交通工具，對於自然賦與的壓迫，抵抗力的確太嫌薄弱了。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>今天是農歷五月五日習俗相沿的端午節，又是一個吃的　日。俗語說得好：「買條黃魚過端午。」所以端午節吃黃魚，也是少不了的。本來黃魚的價格，比較的還算便宜，可是前兩天因爲已在節邊，魚販居奇，已抬了價，今天當然更要貴一些。可是因爲節上少不了它，也不得小忍痛吃一吃了。人口多的人家，買了一尾大黃魚來，切成二段，多加些鹹菜，早一碗，夜一碗，已可敷衍過去。要講究一些，那麽用醋溜糟溜兩種做法，較爲人味。再要講究一些，那麽出骨做魚羹，加火腿丁，竹筍丁，香菌片，莧菜，吃的時候，略洒胡椒末，自然可口；愛吃湯的，來一個火腿黃魚片湯，是多麽的鮮美啊。至於其他葷素菜，節上無一不貴，然而又不能不吃，世上倘是眞有鍾進士，我倒願意看他吃小鬼呢。</p>

<h3>睡眠與臭蟲</h3>
<p>— 如來</p>
<p>和衣食住行同等重要的要稱睡眠了，人體上有許多疾息，往往由缺少睡眠而起的。到了夏天時候，孤島上情形而論，大都屋少人稠，悶熱如蒸，睡眠不免要受相當的妨碍，所以夏天極應該戒除夜賭，或作無益消遣，還是早些安眠。</p>
<p>睡眠最受影響的，是臭虫相擾，中下家庭，免不了有臭虫，越是勞苦階級，這倘問題越是嚴重，可憐勞動了一天，難道連夜間天賦睡眠的權利都剝奪了去嗎？再從另一方面着想，我們人類是動物之王，尤其在這科學時代，怎麽應付微小的臭虫，竟也束手無策？恐怕一般科學界人士太忽略了這種瑣小的問題，也許他們住的是洋房大廳，感覺不到這種痛苦，不肯下一番研究功夫吧。</p>
<p>最近我試到一種强且靈藥水，是孫克錦醫師發明，只要把藥液噴注到床熱棕棚或壁縫裏去，不到五分鐘功夫，立刻就把所有的成虫和子殲滅得乾乾凈凈。現在他們派出許多職員，到各處家庭裏去訪問，當塲試騐，使用戶信任之後，然後向他們推銷，這種方法，倒也很可取法的。</p>

<h3>出租亭子間的新條件</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>昨天我在某處電車站等車，抬頭督見電桿上新貼一張煊紅的召租條子，其原文大的如下：</p>
<p>茲有亭子間一間，房間寬大，光綫充足，如欲租者，至多以二三人爲限，且須有保押爲合格。</p>
<p>我看了之後，不禁有些懷疑，如云欲租者至多以二三人爲限，不知至少若干人，是否僅租房子而不許居人；又云必須保押，則欲租亭子間者，非但保人，又須押款，如做旅館中之茶房然，必須人錢兩保，同一嚴重。</p>
<p>老做二房東的，對於三房客本有兩個普通的條件：一是有小兒者不租，一是無眷屬者不租。這兩個條件，我覺得已是十分「促狹一，而且其中不免有矛盾之處，旣有眷屬，怎樣不許他們生小兒，旣生小兒，又違背他們的章則，是否一生小兒，二房東即下逐客之令，還是生了小兒，二房東不許他們撫養，我想　二那東的必定有一個很好的辦法。</p>
<p>現在這張召租的條子，更加萬妥萬當了，他說至多以二三人爲限，二三人已是至多，明明僅租一人可知，因爲一人決不會養小兒，則對於有小兒不租的條件，確是相合。如謂須有保押云云，押款若干，雖然沒有開出價格，大的亦一定可觀，須付押款的用意，大的恐怕三房客缺少房錢之故，但是旣有保人，則房金無虞缺少。</p>
<p>若謂保人並不是恐怕缺少房金，則保人所保何物，保他們不做强盜麽？保他們不討老婆或小老婆麽？保他們不軋姘頭麼？假定一軋姘頭，一討老婆或小老婆，又不免要生出小兒，使二房東煩惱，則保人自不可缺少，二房東固有的條件，已覺最苛，今又補充這樣兩條件，似乎更加周密，甚矣二房東之不可不做也。如是，我想做二房東這樣操心過慮，還是速將召租　子扯去，不做二房東爲妙，不然除此四條件外或生別種意外的危險。</p>
<h3>沒有房東的房屋</h3>
<p>— 商人</p>
<p>這三年來，房租糾紛的迭見，除了最後對簿公庭之外，似乎沒有其他妥善辦法可以得到正常的解決。最近法租界當局雖然有不准收納小租的規定，但是對於房租的高低，還是無法規定，這因爲有種種原因，如地段，房屋的新舊，供水與否，以及其他，不能如物品一般可以標價注明。</p>
<p>過去，關於房租糾紛的極端，不外如下兩種方式：大房東對付二房東是拆屋翻造；二房東對付三房客是出頂換主，前者以女子銀行與慶餘里之訟爲大家週知的，後者更不勝枚舉；但在房屋出頂以後，新主人又否認承頂者，實屬創舉，昨日本報廣吿宣震東律師代表大新街迎春坊九號三房客全體聲明，就首先吿訴了我們這樣一件怪事，其原文如下：</p>
<p>「茲據上開當事人同意發行所等來稱，同人等之房屋，乃向洪德藩租賃，洪君前忽遷出九號，將房屋出頂與大陸公司，强逼遷讓，將電水剪斷，同人等乃謀法律上之救濟，洪君旣避不到庭，大陸公司代理律師又否認承頂，數月以來，同人等只得將房金提存法院及四行儲蓄會，爲此委請代表催吿該房屋負責人速來領取，以淸手續等情……」</p>
<p>從「强迫遷讓，將電水剪斷，同人等乃謀法律上之救濟，」等語看來，這糾紛是相當嚴重的：不過「洪君旣避不到庭，大陸公司律師又否認承頂，」則又使人對這糾紛莫測高深，而其中必有曲折是很明顯的，現在我們暫時也不必多費腦力去加以推測，在這幾天之內，即使洪某冉不出面，原來的大房東必定會出來揭穿這悶葫蘆的。</p>
<p>不過，作　房客的筆者，對於此事却不能不有一點牢騷！對於一切糾紛大家不妨公開宜佈，要加就宜佈加的理由，翻造出頂的巴戲都是要不得的！房子沒有了主人果然更使人不知所措，俗語所謂「揪不牢辮子」，但是反過來一想，也是最容易解決的，房客如果不要白住房子，就乾脆把按月租金捐於慈善機關去，再把收據句法完存案。</p>

<p>乙：這鐘買了三年多了。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第一章　「一位挺漂亮的小姐！」</p>
<p>屋子前面有一垜短牆，牆上裝着尖刺的短鐵柵。那門是　花的鐵條做的，上端也有尖刺，都漆著淡綠色。我們剛踏進這鐵條門，便瞧見左手裏有個小小的花圃，的有八九尺深，一丈半以上闊，圃中種著些草花，內中幾朶淺紅的月季，瘦小異常，受了夜雨的欺誘，嫣然開放，可愛又覺可憐。有幾隻瓷盆倒很精細，但隨便放在地上，瓷面的四周已濺滿了泥水，顯得屋主人對於時花的工作並不感到怎樣的興趣。右側裹也有一小小空地，有短冬靑樹隔著，不過已被那看門人的小　的鬥房佔去了一大半，加著另有一株棕樹，實際上已所「空」無多。</p>
<p>我跟著霍桑走上那條陽光初照還沒有乾透的水泥狹徑時，那瘦長身材穿一件玄袖呢夾袍子的倪金壽探長，早已從裏面迎了出來。</p>
<p>「霍先生，包先生，勞駕了。這件事很奇怪——似乎有些兒麻煩。」</p>
<p>霍桑微笑著答道：「那末，我小能不先向你致謝，你又讓我有一個廣廣眼界的機會。」</p>
<p>倪金壽又跟我們握了握手，領導著走上那三級水泥階。霍桑的目光在地上和左右兩旁流轉著，顯見他已在施展他的優越的觀察力。我瞧見這水泥徑上浮着一些兒泥，顯見是從旁邊花圃上經雨水冲過來的。　（十）</p>
<h3>端午</h3>
<p>— 子長</p>
<p>一三節付淸，不得拖欠，」乃一年中頭一個淸算關頭；陽曆五月過得懨懨成疾，除開錢賬之外，尙有精神上感覺到「耿耿此懷」之賬，豈能免俗哉！</p>
<p>五月（舊曆）榴花照眼紅，時也！舉世在紅血中爭取新生命。而且端午亦是蟲生蟲死之節，端賴吾人驅除得力；雖然「醬裏蟲醬裏死」，必合自然淘汰；而整頓醬缸，使不再產蛆，此亦萬民於驅除蟲害後亟不容緩之治本與建設也。其實比淸算賬目還要緊，「物必先腐而後蟲生之」雖屬老生常談，亦爲至理名言。</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Unfold on the West Bank of the Han River; Chinese Troops Complete Encirclement of Japanese Forces; Battle Line Shifts Near Jingzhou and Shashi as Chinese Prepare for Subsequent Developments; Japanese Troops Invading Westward Controlled on All Fronts After Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>Yichang:  The true face of the battle on the west bank of the Xiang River has gradually unfolded in an environment of extreme Chinese military superiority.  Japanese troops concentrated near Jingmen and Shili Pu, ten miles south of Jingmen, began an offensive to the west at dawn on the 9th.  Fierce battles erupted everywhere from Guanyin Temple (northwest of Jingmen) and Yuxi River to the Qian area on the south side of Herong Town (both southwest of Jingmen). By noon, all the Japanese troops in the Qian area had been suppressed by the fierce Chinese artillery fire, with casualties mounting and their morale greatly diminished.  Although the Japanese continuously employed numerous aircraft to assist in their fierce attacks, they were unable to advance an inch. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Gongan:  Japanese troops who crossed the Xiang River westward from the Duobaowan and Sigangshi areas on the 5th were intercepted and flanked by Chinese forces at every turn near Benghu Town, Xinhe Town, Hougang Town, Shi Huiqiao Pu, and Sifang Pu (all northeast of Jiangling).  The fighting lasted continuously for three days and nights, repeatedly blunting the Japanese advance.  By the morning of the 8th, the Japanese forces near Sifang Pu joined forces with the Japanese troops moving south, dividing their forces to attack Jiangling and Shashi fiercely.  A certain Chinese unit carried out a mobile interception in the Mashiqiao Ersheng Temple area (both northeast of Jiangling).  By nightfall, the battle line had gradually shifted near Jingzhou and Shashi.  The Chinese military is now preparing for subsequent developments with all its strength, and has, according to plan, moved into the vast lake and marsh area southeast of Jingzhou and Shashi, exposing the flanks and rear of the Japanese troops advancing westward to the Chinese forces.  The Japanese troops are increasingly trapped in an irredeemable predicament. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing:  According to a spokesman for the Chinese army, while dozens of Japanese aircraft bombed Xuan Chang yesterday and the day before, yesterday the Chinese army completed the encirclement of a large number of Japanese troops on the west bank of the Han River.  At this time, the Japanese guns are clearly aimed at Yichang.  Japanese aircraft bombed Yichang in formations of two or three, in several waves over the past two days.  Six people were killed in the air raids, and many were injured.  During Saturday's air raid, a bomb landed near British property in the city.  The spokesman also said that the Chinese army in Hubei is not only defending Yichang, but is also using a large-scale encirclement to annihilate the main force of the Japanese army on the west bank of the Han River. (9th dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>
<p>Chongqing:  According to today's Central Hubei dispatch, the fighting is extremely fierce along the fifty-mile stretch of the Han River front line from Qianjiang to Jiukou.  The Japanese side is using heavy artillery fire to bombard the Chinese army positions on the west bank of the Han River to cover their troops' operations.  Yesterday, the Chinese artillery also fiercely bombarded the Japanese army positions on the east bank of the Han River opposite Shayang.  The fierce battle did not stop all day yesterday.  The Chinese military's objective is to capture several important strongholds in order to cut off the Japanese army's rear. (9th dispatch from the Associated Press)</p>
<p>Chongqing:  A Chinese military spokesman stated today that the Chinese side is confident that the Chinese army is not only capable of holding Yichang to resist the Japanese army currently attacking upstream, but will also eventually encircle and annihilate the Japanese army that has crossed the Han River.  The spokesman declined to reveal the Chinese army's strategy, but said that the Chinese troops defending Yichang are all well-trained elite troops, and are currently deployed in various positions in accordance with the orders of the commander-in-chief. (9th dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Yichang:  For days, the Chinese army has been fighting the Japanese for control of the various crossings in the lower reaches of the Xiang River.  In the areas both north and south of Shayang, the fighting with the Japanese is extremely fierce.  The remaining Japanese troops on the west bank have been almost completely wiped out.  On the afternoon of the 7th, Japanese naval vessels arriving from the lower reaches to reinforce their forces launched a counterattack, but were strongly suppressed by the Chinese forces and failed to achieve their aim.  On the eastern front, a large number of Japanese boats arrived to reinforce their forces and cover the Japanese troops' landing and counterattack, which again led to a bloody battle with the Chinese forces.  The Chinese army occupied favorable terrain and unleashed intense firepower, inflicting heavy damage on the Japanese.  At the same time, the Chinese army on the opposite banks of Duobaowan, Sigangshi, Zhangjiegang, and other places also fiercely attacked Japanese boats and ships operating on the water.  More than ten Japanese motorboats and four small steamers towing Japanese soldiers and military supplies such as ammunition, as well as more than twenty civilian boats that they were towing, have been sunk by the Chinese forces one after another.  The surface of the Xiang River is full of Japanese corpses, all floating downstream.  The Chinese army is now advancing eastward along the river, deeply intercepting key passes in the lower reaches. (9th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yichang:  On the west bank of the Xiang River, the Japanese troops invading from the north and south were ambushed and attacked by powerful Chinese units northwest of Jingmen on the 7th, killing more than a thousand Japanese soldiers.

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Spying on Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Several aircraft, divided into four batches, intruded into Sichuan territory at around 10:00 AM today, appearing to be attempting to attack the Chinese capital.  Seeing that the Chinese had strong defenses and due to bad weather, they fled. (9th dispatch)</p>

On the morning of the 4th, a unit of Japanese troops from Wenxi divided their forces and advanced towards the Dongxi Lei Yangguan villages (both northwest of Wenxi), and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with a certain Chinese unit. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingji:  On the morning of the 2nd, a certain Chinese unit again launched an attack on Yincheng Town and the areas north and south of Gaoping. After several hours of fierce fighting, they captured key points such as Honghe, Shitan Yu, Nei Wang Village, Nan Song, and Xi Zhang one after another. They then destroyed four Japanese vehicles between Bei Song and Zhao Village. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang:  On the morning of the 6th, Japanese troops invading from Tianjingguan to Qianhou Ge Tao (northwest of Tianjingguan) were fiercely intercepted by the Chinese forces and suffered heavy losses. By nightfall, the Japanese troops were reinforced and launched a counterattack, but were again fiercely attacked head-on by the Chinese forces. The battle lasted until midnight, and the remaining Japanese troops, unable to withstand the onslaught, collapsed and retreated. (8th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Analysis of the Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>The Japanese Prime Minister, Yonai, explained the current cabinet's foreign policy to reporters, stating that the China Incident would continue to proceed according to the planned procedure, and that the policy of non-participation in the European War would remain unchanged, with no new insights offered.  However, his words implicitly expressed dissatisfaction with the impatience and clamor of some so-called "reformist" elements in Japan.  This statement by Yonai, on the surface, is merely a reaffirmation of the current cabinet's consistent policy of maintaining the status quo.  However, the recent complexity of Japanese political opinions and the turmoil in the political situation can also be easily gleaned from this.</p>
<p>Since the "May 15th" incident, Japanese politics have long deviated from constitutional norms.  Political parties have retreated behind the scenes, and the military-fascist forces control everything in the political arena. The military is a supreme cabinet, and the so-called reformist politicians are sycophants, fanning the flames and colluding with each other. This phenomenon has persisted for several years, right up to the present.  The conservative forces opposed to the military, while outwardly having to allow military fascism to run rampant, are not actually willing to retreat. They are constantly seizing opportunities, preparing to take advantage of any flaws to restore their political weight. This struggle has been the main theme of political turmoil in Japan for several years, and has also formed the main cause of instability in its political situation.  Of course, this is only a contradiction within the Japanese ruling class, which has greatly weakened the internal solidarity of Japan and made it impossible to achieve political stability even during wartime.  In general, however, this internal contradiction does not affect the consistency of its aggressive stance.  During the "September 18th" incident, the side effects of Japan's external aggression often promoted a political strategy of internal solidarity.  But recently, this political strategy has come to a dead end with the protracted and unsuccessful invasion of China.  The war of aggression is no longer enough to stimulate the emotions of its people, nor can it be used to ease internal conflicts. The unprecedented suffering of prolonged warfare has enveloped the country. The exhaustion of national finances, the decline of industry and commerce, and the withering of people's lives have all deepened and expanded the already latent social crisis.  These phenomena, reflected in the political arena, have led to a gradual decline in the military's prestige and the attempted rise of the conservative camp.  The Yonai cabinet was born under these circumstances.  The failure of the war of aggression against China, the capitulation to provocation against the Soviet Union, the abandonment of the German-Italian line, and the inability to break the external deadlock are all major reasons for the decline of the Japanese military-fascist forces.  Although the Yonai cabinet came into being under these circumstances, it cannot offer better solutions to the many difficulties inherited from the fallen Hiranuma and Abe eras.  At best, it can only try its best to maintain the status quo, with the ability to continue the policies of the previous cabinets.  As a result, conservative elements and the general public are bound to be disappointed, while the reformist elements gradually express impatience.  Recently, the European war situation has been expanding daily, and Nazi military forces have achieved initial victories. The Japanese political situation has become more turbulent due to this external stimulus, as exemplified by the New Party Movement.  Kuhara's proposal all indicate that the fascist camp has begun to advance a new offensive.  This is by no means something that can be dispelled by Yonai's policy report, which is a mere repetition of old ideas.  Although the military's attitude has remained silent so far, it has tested the conservative forces in the past with the Asama Maru problem and the Saito incident. The recent replacement of the Minister of the Imperial Household by Kido is undoubtedly also the result of indirect military pressure.  So far, only a few reformist politicians have stirred up trouble. Once it reaches a certain stage, the military may directly intervene, as it did in the past when it overthrew the Abe cabinet.</p>
<p>These various fluctuations, subjectively intended to promote political stability, have objectively become the main current in the instability of the political situation, increasing Japanese political unease, but it is difficult to achieve any results. For three years, many reform plans have been implemented in Japan internally, but have they reduced their own difficulties in the slightest? So-called measures such as reforming the political structure and establishing national unity might have had some influence if they had been proposed at the beginning of the war. Now, the Japanese government and public have long lost confidence in the war of aggression against China, and the will of the people and soldiers has been disrupted by slogans such as "peace" and "settling the incident." Reform plans proposed at this time only expose the decorations in the face of helplessness.  The current suffering of Japan is a fact. Whether it is the chaebol who are in charge of the aggression or the people who only seek to live, everyone is unusually impatient and feels that the future is unusually difficult and bleak.  Among the Japanese government and public, there are of course those who are relatively enlightened and recognize that the war of aggression against China is the root cause of all current problems, but absolutely no one possesses the qualifications to call upon, the courage to expose, and even less the power to seek a solution. The Japanese authorities are constantly preparing to end the China Incident, but in reality, the measures taken are only to prolong and complicate the "incident" further. Even knowing that it will be prolonged and complicated, they still have to constantly prepare to end the China Incident, using self-deception to muddle through, as exemplified by the China policy that Yonai talked about the other day. The so-called reformist elements are indeed acting perversely and recklessly, and even in the conservative camp, isn't there a lack of a sense of direction? They are all equally willing to accept the dictates of fate, and there is no fundamental difference between them.  Japan's failure today has reached a very serious stage in military, economic, and diplomatic terms, but its rulers have always lacked a far-sighted vision and understanding. Their only action is internal infighting, vying for control of the regime.  Given this situation, whether the Japanese political situation will see a further rise of military fascism or the conservative camp clinging to the old ways, what they yearn for is nothing more than to expect some loophole in the international changes to provide them with a chance for luck. The inevitable final outcome is that they will eventually collapse in the rapidly evolving international situation.</p>
<h3>German Main Force Continues Fierce Attack, Advances Towards Seine River Basin; Fierce Fighting Also Occurs South of Aisne River; Front Extends from Coast to Argonne Region</h3>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just released a war bulletin stating that the frontline battles remain extremely fierce. In recent days, the front has continued to expand eastward, reaching the vicinity of Argonne. Starting at dawn today, the enemy launched another fierce offensive along the line from Château-Porcien to Chesne-Popiel. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just released a war bulletin stating, "From the coastal area to the 'Avenue de la Dame' line, fierce battles raged throughout the day and have not yet ceased. (1) West of the Oise River, the enemy is intensifying pressure on our positions in the lower reaches of the L'Aisne River, and is concentrating a large number of troops between Aumale and Noyon, launching a full-scale offensive. The enemy's infantry units, newly transferred from the rear to the front line, immediately launched successive attacks under the cover of intense artillery fire, finally breaking into our positions. In total, the enemy force consists of more than twenty fresh divisions, supplemented by seven tank divisions, far outnumbering our forces. Due to the vast disparity in strength, our army was unable to stop the enemy's advance and was forced to retreat. However, the enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. (2) The pressure exerted by the enemy on the east side of the Oise River has also increased, and a large number of reinforcements have arrived to assist in the battle (including a large number of tank units), giving them a boost in momentum, and they have gained strongholds on the high ground south of the Aisne River. Our army is adopting a steady, step-by-step strategy, and will not lightly abandon an inch of territory. In the final decisive engagement, our artillery destroyed thirty-six German tanks, including one of our companies that destroyed nineteen German tanks single-handedly. Another artillery unit, firing at enemy tanks at a short distance of 100 meters, destroyed seventeen tanks in one fell swoop. (3) Our air force was still very active today, continuing to fly to the front lines, disrupting enemy troops, and using machine guns to strafe tank units. Later, they flew to the occupied areas recently captured by the enemy and dropped bombs. Their supply trains that were being transported were also dispersed by our aircraft. In addition, more than 150 of our bombers flew to the front lines this morning under the protection of British and French fighter planes, bombing enemy concentration points. One team even flew to the outskirts of Berlin last night and bombed German factories, all of which safely returned to their bases afterward." (Havas Agency Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>German Offensive Unprecedentedly Fierce; French Front Retreats Again</p>
<p>Paris: Military sources here recently stated that the frontline battles are intensifying and have reached their peak today. The German army is pouring all its strength between the L'Aisne River and the Oise River, launching a fierce attack on the French positions, the scale of which is unprecedented in history. This route is only 150 kilometers long, but the German forces launching the offensive consist of 4,000 tanks and 500,000 infantrymen. The general offensive began at dawn today, with soldiers advancing shoulder to shoulder and in close formation under the intense fire of French machine guns and artillery. South of Amiens and in the direction of Roye, the French army was ordered to retreat last night. The German army took advantage of this to advance, approaching the new positions held by the French army between Aumale and Noyon (that is, between the left bank of the L'Aisne River and the right bank of the Oise River), and encountered strong resistance. French machine gun teams immediately swept the onrushing "human wave," causing heavy casualties to the Germans. At the same time, British and French aircraft attacked German infantry and tank units with machine guns and bombs at an altitude of 70 feet, with considerable success. Although the French troops were vastly outnumbered by the Germans, they still launched surprising attacks in the "no-man's land," repeatedly counterattacking, and finally turned the tide of the positions they held. By evening, the German army launched another large-scale offensive, and the French army, unable to resist, finally ordered an orderly retreat. Although the German army made some progress in this battle, it did not break through the French positions. The German army launched similar offensives in other places as well, such as the advance in the Aisne River basin, which was roughly the same as the battles in the L'Aisne River and Oise River areas. In some places, they have advanced to the banks of the Aisne River, and even built pontoon bridges by evening, intending to cross by force. However, the French army immediately launched a fierce counterattack, repelling the German army to the west of Soissons. The situation east of the city was the same as the previous day. After the German tank units reached the outskirts of Foreste (the town is 40 kilometers northeast of Rouen), the French army immediately launched a large-scale counterattack, assisted by the air force, which was quite effective. In addition, the area is crisscrossed by rivers and adjacent to the forests of Normandy, which is unfavorable for tank activity. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Paris: Military sources here recently stated that today was one of the most critical days of the frontline battles. The German side is fighting with all its strength, sparing no expense, in an attempt to achieve a decisive victory. The total strength, estimated to be between ninety and one hundred divisions, is launching a fierce attack on the French positions from the coast to the Argonne region. About forty divisions are on the line from the coast to the Oise River, about ten divisions are attacking the Aisne River near Soissons, and about forty divisions are in the upper reaches of the Aisne River and near Champagne. As for the results of yesterday's war, the German gains were limited, and the losses outweighed the gains. On the Somme front, after two days of fighting, due to excessive casualties, they had to transfer the second batch of reserves to the front line to fight. In short, judging from yesterday's battle situation, the German army launched a fierce southward offensive south of Amiens. By evening, the battle had moved to the D'Artois area, but the advance of the enemy's infantry was at most only ten to fifteen kilometers. In addition, in the upper reaches of the Aisne River, the German army launched a new offensive on a 40-kilometer front between Château-Porcien (10 kilometers west of Rethel) and Chesne-Popiel (located along the Aisne River to the Meuse River canal). The tank units that had advanced to the vicinity of Foreste on the 7th of this month suffered extremely heavy losses after a fierce French counterattack, and only a small number of troops made some progress in the southwest. (Havas Agency Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Paris: Last night, the French military announced that the German army had gained a strong foothold on the high ground south of the Aisne River, while the French army was defending the foothills of the high ground. A spokesman for the Ministry of War stated that the German army "has completed a bridgehead on the south bank of the Aisne River, and the French army was forced to make a strategic retreat in the Aumale and Noyon areas." He added that fresh French troops had been sent to Foreste to resist the advance of 300 German tanks. The 300 German tanks had penetrated halfway between the Somme River and the Seine River, but were besieged yesterday. The French army bombed the isolated German tank units with aircraft and artillery, while preventing German infantry from crossing the L'Aisne Valley to rescue the tank units. The distance between the tanks was 75 yards. The French Ministry of War reported that the German General Staff had exhausted all its reserves in the campaign in northern France, but the German side had not achieved any definite results "despite heavy sacrifices in manpower and materials," except for the tank attack in an area called Notredame east of the Seine River. Yesterday, the terrible German offensives were blocked by the entire French front. General Weygand's strategy has not changed. Every defensive position from the seaside to the "Avenue de la Dame" that has been shelled is firmly defended by the French army. At dusk last night, the front lines extended from the coast to the interior through the L'Aisne Valley and the mountainous area of Ham on the Somme River, and from there through the forest plateau northwest of Soissons to both banks of the Aisne River east of Soissons. The 300 German tanks that broke through Normandy yesterday seemed to be advancing down the Seine Valley, where the important cities of Rouen and Le Havre are located. The natural defenses of the lower Seine are very well developed. The river between Rouen and Le Havre is full of important factories, oil refineries, and large oil pools, all owned by the American Petroleum Company. (United Press Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>German Army Assembles Enormous Forces; Rear Supply Lines Threatened</p>
<p>Paris: Officials here recently stated that the German army's fierce offensive in northern France in recent days was intended to inflict a fatal blow on the French army and force the French army to engage in a decisive battle at a time and place designated by the German General Staff. However, the French command has already seen through their plan and has taken the initiative to retreat to avoid their sharp edge, and the German army's battle plan has not been realized. In total, the number of infantry mobilized in this decision was no less than 500,000, and the number of tanks was no less than 4,000, while the frontline of their operations was only 145 kilometers. With such a narrow frontline, such a large force was used, and their desire to make a desperate gamble and achieve a quick victory is self-evident. What is more, after crossing the Somme River yesterday, the German army shortened the battlefront again and avoided attacking the Lys River, because the Lys River basin is mostly marshland, and the German army did not dare to advance rashly. Currently, the German army's rear supply lines have become an arc. The German supply train must pass through this narrow corridor to reach the front, but the British air force base is on its left, and the French army and air force base is on its right. Under this double-sided attack, the German army's supply route is under tremendous threat. As far as the French army's battle strategy is concerned, although it is inevitable to suffer some losses when resisting the German army's large-scale offensive, the heavy losses of the German army cannot be compared to it. In addition, because the French army is good at avoiding the enemy's attacks, its strength remains intact when retreating to new positions, and it can wait at ease for the German army to lose its elite and penetrate deeply before inflicting a painful blow. In a nutshell, the goal of the German army's large-scale offensive has not been achieved. Although it has made some progress in recent days, the losses have been heavy, and the gains do not outweigh the losses. What is more, the French army has the possibility of taking the initiative in the future. Although it is difficult to predict when the defense will be turned into an offense, once the opportunity is ripe, the Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand will be able to make a decisive decision and launch an attack. This can be asserted. (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>French Analysis of the War Situation; German Offensive Strength Declines</p>
<p>Paris: Last night, the French government released a battle analysis report stating that the number of German tanks and aircraft has been sharply reduced after several days of fierce fighting. According to other official documents, if Britain and France continue to actively produce them, and with the continuous supply from the United States, the air power of Britain and France will be able to match Germany by mid-July. This French report believes that if the number of aircraft in Britain and France is equal to that of Germany, the British and French air forces will definitely have an advantage, because even if the number of aircraft is very scarce at present, they often win in air combat. It can be seen that the skills of British and French airmen are very good. With excellent airmen and a large number of aircraft, the power of the air force is enough to surpass it. There is no need to mention it. Now Germany is suffering heavy material losses from time to time. The number of tanks lost every day is often between 200 and 400, and the number of aircraft lost every day is between 40 and 60. It is said that the German tanks and aircraft destroyed by France in the past few days were all driven directly from the armory to the battlefield. From this, it can be seen that Germany has no surplus in the country. In the eight months since the German invasion of Poland, the German armory spent a lot of effort to replenish the tanks and armored vehicles destroyed by the Polish army, and only after replenishing the losses did it exceed the original amount. When Germany began its invasion of Belgium, according to French official estimates, there were a total of 5,000 tanks and armored vehicles, but half of them have been destroyed or out of use. Later, Germany took a large number of tanks from the Netherlands and Belgium, which enabled it to enter the Somme battlefield with 3,000 to 4,000 tanks. It is said that 2,000 of them were driven out to fight on the second day of the Somme War. The French report continued that after 600 tanks were destroyed, the German army responded with an equal number of new tanks. Now there are still 2,000 German tanks in operation, and some of them have penetrated 15 miles behind the French lines. Germany may have no surplus left in the country.

<p>Weygand Declares to the Frontline Soldiers to Firmly Defend Their Positions and Not Give Up</p>
<p>Paris: Allied Commander-in-Chief General Weygand has just issued a letter to the frontline soldiers today, which roughly stated, "The enemy is launching an offensive on the entire front from the coast to the Montmédy area, and the war will extend to the border of Switzerland. The frontline soldiers, no matter where they are stationed, should firmly defend their positions, look ahead, and not give up. The bravery of our army and air force units in combat is exemplary and is known to the Commander-in-Chief. Not only do I express my gratitude, but France is also grateful. My soldiers, the safety of the motherland not only requires your bravery, but also requires your full determination to launch and fight. I know you will be able to do the job well. The enemy has suffered heavy losses and will see its strength decline again and again. We have now reached the last quarter of an hour. You must all persevere to the end." (Havas Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>German War Bulletin</p>
<p>Berlin: Yesterday's German war bulletin still does not publish the names of towns and cities, in order to avoid revealing signs of the nature and objectives of the new offensive. The war bulletin issued by the German army during the Frankish War also took a silent attitude, but it can be asserted that the German army has broken through the "Weygand Line" and continues to advance. The German air force is also actively assisting in the battle. The scope of activities in recent days has been to bomb the enemy's rear supply lines. German aircraft also bombed the Narvik area. The number of prisoners captured near Dunkirk has increased to 88,000, almost all of whom are from the army, which proves that the rear work of the British Expeditionary Force is undertaken by the French army. (Haitong Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>German Leader's Camp: This afternoon, the German war bulletin stated that in the past four days, German infantry, tank units, and the air force have cooperated very well in the Somme and Oise regions, defeating the strong enemy forces and fresh troops. The German army has penetrated deep into the French defense line in the lower Seine River and captured a lot of supplies. German aircraft bombed the enemy's artillery and anti-aircraft artillery positions, and dispersed the enemy's concentrated forces and tank units. The German army took advantage of the victory to pursue eastward and has crossed the Aisne River. German aircraft bombed the airfields in Cherbourg and north and southeast of Paris, and bombed the railways and highways northwest of Paris. The Allies lost a total of 58 aircraft yesterday, of which 39 were destroyed in air combat, 13 were shot down by anti-aircraft artillery, and the rest were aircraft parked on the ground. German aircraft only had one aircraft missing. Two German warships (Gneisenau and Scharnhorst), under the command of Marshal Ma Xia'er, broke through the siege. When the two ships were in the Arctic Ocean, they destroyed the British aircraft carrier "Glorious" and a destroyer. Another German ship sank the British troop transport ship Vorlama (21,000 tons) and the naval oil tanker Gasoline Pioneer (9,100 tons), and captured hundreds of enemy personnel. The German navy is still continuing its operations. (Haitong Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<h3>Italy's Posturing to Participate in the War Still Awaits; Roman Newspapers Arbitrarily Attack Britain and France; Saying Italy's Patience is Limited</h3>
<p>Rome: Ansaldu today delivered a speech to the Italian army on the radio, saying that although the timing of Italy's participation in the war is still a secret of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Italy during this second stage of the war should take Britain as our enemy. Italy has an important responsibility for the development of the situation. Italy should join hands with Germany to fight against Britain, and at the same time fight for Italy's independence in the Mediterranean. Italy appointed General Ba as the commander of the Southern Army, which is of great significance. France will not be able to resist the German offensive in the short term. The fall of Paris and the retreat to the third line of defense is equivalent to France's suicide. Once France collapses, we will begin to fight the main enemy, Britain, head-on. Now that Britain is under this threat, it will no longer send troops and munitions to France. (Haitong Dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian newspapers continued to attack Britain and France yesterday, saying that Italy can no longer tolerate it and will fight Britain and France to the death. The Italian Foreign Minister's "Report on International Relations" wrote on Saturday that "Italy is now on the eve of participating in the war." "Italy's patience has reached its limit. The European democracies that despise Italy must be attacked. Italy will fight the wealthy politicians of London and Paris to the death." The Italian Daily also issued a warning to Britain and France, saying that after Italy participates in the war, the Italian and German air forces will immediately bomb the five major cities in Britain in retaliation. (United Press Dispatch, Day)</p>
<p>Rome: Italian reporter Gai Da published an article in "Italian News" stating that the purpose of Britain and France is to destroy Italy. Although Italy has not yet participated in the war, Britain and France have used various means to deprive Italy of its economic and political interests. To this day, they have intensified restrictions on Italian shipping with forceful actions. Britain and France have even taken aggressive measures in the Adriatic Sea, threatening direct traffic between Italy and Albania. However, Italy will not tolerate this forever and will rise up to defend the country's freedom and the right to life. (Haitong Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>National Panic</h3>
<p>Rome: The people of the whole country are still panicking and asking each other, "Will the war break out?" But no one dares to give a definite answer. The sound of the army marching and the rumbling of aircraft in the sky still fill the air with anxiety. Although the people do not want to see war, the sensational newspapers continue to say that the chains of fate have sounded, and they criticize Britain and France with fierce words, but they are not enough to stir up popular sentiment, because the people lack a strong spirit of unity. The general public still does not admit that war is inevitable. (Haitong Dispatch, 9th)</p>

<p>Paris: The Department of Aeronautics issued a communiqué stating, "Our aircraft flew to the front lines last night and bombed the 'pontoon bridges' built by Germany on the Somme River. The flights were very low at the time, and all targets were achieved. Afterwards, they attacked German motorized units, supply trains, and highways, all of which were hit. Today, a team of our bombers flew to the front lines and disrupted German motorized units, destroying almost all of their leading troops, and destroyed many German tanks with bombs and machine guns. A total of more than 100 tons of bombs were dropped at the time." (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Aviation announced that on Friday, the British Air Force attacked the enemy's supply lines, ammunition and gasoline warehouses, troop concentration points, and armored vehicles day and night, destroying a railway station in Xiersen and strafing troop concentration points with machine guns. Explosions and fires occurred in many places in Albeville, and the airfield there was heavily damaged. British heavy bombers attacked military targets in northwestern Germany, and all participating aircraft returned to their defenses safely. British fighter planes shot down 17 German planes, and 12 British planes were missing. Yesterday, British medium bombers inflicted heavy damage on enemy motorized units. The enemy and mechanized units concentrated near the front line near Amiens were repeatedly attacked by British aircraft and suffered heavy damage. (Reuters Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>London: A British and German air battle occurred in the sky above a city in the southeast coastal area of England late last night. The sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of pearls, and anti-aircraft artillery also fired to assist in the battle. The results of the battle have not yet been ascertained. When the German aircraft suddenly arrived, the British first illuminated them with searchlights and then fired anti-aircraft artillery until the British aircraft arrived to participate in the battle before stopping firing. There was no warning before this air raid. (United Press Dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Authorities here last night denied the Allied claim that French aircraft bombed the outskirts of Berlin on Friday night.

<h3>British Armed Merchant Cruiser Sunk by Torpedo; Rumor of Sinking of HMS Glorious Denied; British Statement</h3>
<p>London – The Admiralty announced that the British armed merchant cruiser HMS "Calabria" was sunk by a German submarine torpedo, with the loss of two officers and two sailors. The rest were rescued. The ship was a converted Cunard White Star liner, displacing 20,277 tons. This is the second armed merchant cruiser lost by Britain in the war, the first being HMS "Rawalpindi," which was sunk last year in action against the German pocket battleship "Deutschland." (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>London – Reports here deny German claims of sinking the British aircraft carrier HMS "Glorious." It is said that the Germans had previously mentioned sinking only a few British aircraft carriers, and HMS "Glorious" was among them. London sources point out that it is not surprising that the Germans would choose HMS "Glorious" as the subject of a new fabrication. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The British aircraft carrier HMS "Glorious," claimed to have been sunk yesterday by the German Navy, had a displacement of 22,500 tons, carried 48 aircraft, 40 anti-aircraft guns, 18 machine guns, and two torpedo tubes.

<h3>Britain, France, and Belgium Sign Tripartite Agreement; Adjusting Financial Relations</h3>
<p>London – The Treasury announced that Britain, France, and Belgium signed a tripartite agreement on Friday to adjust their financial and fiscal relations. The agreement is based on the Anglo-French agreement of December 4, 1939, in other words, it expands the Anglo-French agreement to include Belgium. The exchange rates between the pound sterling, the French franc, and the Belgian franc have now been fixed, with the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the Belgian franc being the same as the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the French franc, i.e., 176.5 francs equal to one pound sterling. The British and French financial authorities will supply Belgium with the pounds sterling or French francs it needs, and the Belgian financial authorities will also supply Britain and France with the Belgian francs they need. With this agreement among the three countries, the gold or foreign exchange required as a result of the war can be shared equally between Britain and France on the one hand and Belgium on the other. Britain, France, and the Netherlands have now agreed on the principles, and a tripartite financial agreement will also be signed in the coming days. Thus, the alliance of the four countries in the war effort can be effectively extended to the economic sphere. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>New York Foreign Exchange Market Experiencing Violent Fluctuations in Sterling Price</p>
<p>London – The price of sterling in the New York foreign exchange market has experienced violent fluctuations again. Traders are all trying to figure out the possible effects of the British gold regulations. Even small orders of magnitude are enough to affect the exchange rate between Britain and America. The market's current function seems to be to clear existing orders. Experts say that the authorities have yet to clarify how transactions made before the promulgation of the new regulations will be settled. Today, the pound sterling opened at a price of 3.67 and closed at 3.75. The closing price yesterday was 3.82. The highest price for the day was 3.795 and the lowest price was 3.67.

<h3>France Denies Mistreating German Prisoners</h3>

At the same time, the French High Command also issued a public announcement to refute these allegations, stating that the French army has always strictly adhered to international law in its treatment of enemy prisoners of war.

<h3>Japanese Authorities Crack Down on Extravagant Lifestyles; Indulgence in Sensual Pleasures Among Those Prohibited</h3>
<p>Tokyo – Tokyo is implementing new regulations prohibiting women and hostesses from wearing Western-style evening gowns. This is aimed at the 30,000 bars and cafes in Tokyo that attract a horde of lustful men. The Metropolitan Police Department believes that such clothing, which often exposes the shoulders and arms, easily arouses the carnal desires of men enjoying themselves. Therefore, female staff and hostesses are all required to wear more dignified clothing. Dancing is also prohibited in these venues. Restaurants, cafes, bars, and secret clubs must all close at 10 pm every night to prevent revelers from wasting their money and time. The construction of such entertainment venues is also prohibited. Even going for car rides is now among the prohibitions. Train fares will also be increased to prevent vacationers from traveling. Furthermore, the authorities are also cracking down on people spending their money on entertainment such as music, movies, theaters, and sumo wrestling, and are notifying department stores not to display luxury goods in glass windows and not to publish advertisements for such items. Even daily newspapers and periodicals that encourage enjoyment or extravagance are prohibited from publication and distribution, as life has become difficult in recent years and people should strive to practice thrift.

<h3>US Embargo Immediately Implemented; Japan Suffers Major Blow</h3>
<p>Washington – The US government's ban on the export of machine tools will officially take effect on Monday. As far as US policy is concerned, the embargo has already taken effect. Neutral countries in Europe and Japan can no longer obtain tools that US officials deem necessary for national defense. Undersecretary of State Welles stated that he might be able to obtain detailed information about the embargo on Monday. President Roosevelt told reporters that the embargo has not yet officially taken effect. (United Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Policy Remains Unchanged; US-Japan Relations Difficult to Improve; Statement by Undersecretary Welles</h3>
<p>Washington – Yesterday, US Undersecretary of State Welles neither formally welcomed nor expressed dislike for the suggestion that the US and Japan should resolve the disputes in the Pacific so that both countries can concentrate on protecting their borders. Welles answered questions from reporters about mediating US-Japan relations and maintaining the status quo in East Asia within the realm of possibility, using gentle diplomatic language. When reporters asked Welles to express his opinion on suggestions that steps should be taken now to improve US-Japan relations, Welles replied that the US is always willing to improve relations with any country, but based on the US's policy towards other countries. The US and Japan often hold talks on the issue of China, such as protecting the interests of US citizens, but have not started any special new talks. "We always hope to improve US-Japan relations." Lippmann, a special writer for a certain newspaper, argued that the US should adjust its relationship with Japan because it is concerned about the situation in Europe. If the US is drawn into the whirlpool of the European war, it is clear that it wants to stabilize the situation in the Pacific, and Japan will end the Sino-Japanese war as soon as possible by restoring its economic power. Informed sources here predict that Japan may use the diplomatic balance of power to prevent the Axis powers from winning in order to avoid the Soviet Union and Germany cooperating to pressure Japan to return the German mandated islands and the rights of the Germans in Shandong after the British fleet is captured by Germany. But, fair sources claim, the US will not change its policy towards China or conclude contracts that hinder China's economic power, even if that idea expands, it will still take time before formal action is taken.

<h3>Original Historical Record of Genghis Khan Completed by Soviet Experts</h3>
<p>TASS Special Dispatch – The original historical record of the great Genghis Khan in 1240 (in Mongolian) has recently been completed by Professor Gotsin of the Department of Oriental Studies of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. The historical record was discovered by the Russian, Kafarov, in 1660. He found a Chinese scroll (written in the 14th century), which was divided into twelve chapters and translated from Mongolian into Chinese. In 1886, Kafarov translated the book into Russian and titled it "The Ancient History of Genghis Khan." The book attracted much attention from students studying Mongolian studies. In late 1940, to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the historical record of Genghis Khan, the first part of Professor Gotsin's work will also be published. The historical record of Genghis Khan includes the orders of the Mongolian rulers and Mongolian poems. The language used is almost identical to modern Mongolian.</p>
<h3>Chinese Spokesman Makes Solemn Statement; No Word of Any Peace Proposals; No Peace Between China and Japan Until Japanese Troops Withdraw From Chinese Territory</h3>
<p>Chongqing – A Chinese spokesman declared today that we must solemnly declare that it is absolutely unfounded, due to Japan's frequent rumors of peace. The motive behind these rumors is extremely obvious. The European situation has encouraged most Japanese people to establish peace with China as soon as possible, so that they can advance south with all their strength and resources. It is hereby declared that there can be no peace between China and Japan until Japanese troops withdraw from Chinese territory and the Nine-Power Treaty cannot be maintained. In addition, there is another point that must be declared, that is, any external forces or peace proposals cannot change China's determination to resist to the end. He hopes this will be the final denial of the peace rumors created by the Japanese side. (Reuters, 9th)</p>

<h3>Military Spokesman Discusses Weekly War Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Military Commission Spokesman Discusses Weekly War Situation (June 2 to 8). After the defeat in Hunan and Hubei, they gathered the remnants and invaded the west bank of the Xiang River. Although they have reached a crowd of 30,000, they will inevitably be completely destroyed in front of the strong wall of China. It is worth mentioning the following important battle results:</p>
<p>Henan-Hubei</p>
<p>The Chinese army continued the war results of last week and advanced on the remnants of the Japanese army near Zhaoyang by multiple routes, clearing places such as Huyang Town, Taiping Town, and Yangjiadang. Then they attacked Zhaoyang with fierce charges. The remnants of the Japanese army fled in multiple routes. The Chinese army recovered Zhaoyang on the 2nd and is now pursuing the victory. More than 3,000 Japanese troops were killed and more than 1,000 horses were captured in Tang County Town, Zhangjiaji, and other places. In order to cover up the crushing defeat, the Japanese army crossed the river between Yicheng and Xiangyang on the evening of May 31 and invaded Xiangyang, Yicheng, and Nanzhang in multiple routes. After the Chinese army fought bravely, Xiangyang was immediately recovered. The Japanese who attacked Nanzhang were also forced to retreat to the southeast. The Chinese army pursued fiercely, killing many Japanese troops. Now the Japanese army that has crossed the river has reached more than 30,000. Seeing the fierce attacks by the Chinese army in recent days, the morale of the Japanese army is declining and will inevitably suffer another great defeat. At the same time, the Chinese armies on all routes are majestic and strong, which is enough to fundamentally shake the Japanese base on the Han River.</p>
<p>Guangdong-Guangxi</p>
<p>After the Japanese army invading northern and southern Guangdong strengthened their reinforcements and counterattacked last week, the Chinese army lured the Japanese reinforcements to the mountainous areas of Niubeiji and Liangkou in the northwest in order to annihilate them. Starting from the 1st, the Chinese army formed an encirclement and implemented a scissors-shaped tactic, attacking in multiple routes, and successively recovered Dongdong, Yayi Mountain, Meirongding, Baiwuhu, Erjiadong, Cudongwei, Fenshuiao, Huangniushan, and other places. On the 3rd, Liangkou was also recovered. Taking advantage of the momentum, the important strongholds of Shanshilingwei, Wugong Mountain, and Mibu were captured. The remnants of the Japanese army in Jilonggang were defeated and fled in disarray. At the moment, the Chinese army has advanced to Jiekou and is engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese army. It is estimated that more than 6,000 Japanese troops have been killed. At the same time, the Japanese army invading from Zengcheng was also defeated. At the moment, there are no traces of the Japanese north of Zengcheng. Huaxian was recovered by the Chinese army on the 3rd. On the 4th, the Japanese reinforcements counterattacked, but were defeated by the Chinese army again. In the Xinhuai area, the Chinese army captured Muzhou, Gujing, Longquan, and other places on the 3rd, killing hundreds of Japanese troops and capturing the commander-in-chief of the puppet Southern Army, Fang Zhenghua, the battalion commander, Mo Fubiao, Japanese advisers, and more than 20 Japanese and puppet officers and soldiers, and seized a mountain gun, two mortars, and many machine guns.</p>
<p>Hunan-Jiangxi</p>
<p>The Japanese army in northern Hunan has been swept by the Chinese army on all routes in recent weeks, and the casualties have been heavy. The Chinese army has twice entered the Yanglousi railway station, and the Japanese losses have been extremely heavy. It has also recovered Mishan and burned the Japanese automobile station at Chaanling. On the evening of the 5th, several Japanese cars and tanks were destroyed near Yueyang, and more than 200 Japanese tank captains and soldiers were killed. The railways in Chang'an Station, Pingdiepu, and other places have been repeatedly destroyed, and even more Japanese troops have been killed. In total, more than 1,000 Japanese troops have been killed successively in the past week. The Japanese army in Shatang Port (east of Wuning) in northern Jiangxi was defeated by the Chinese army, and the Chinese army captured many artillery pieces and more than 100 guns. On the 2nd, a Chinese unit attacked Ruichang and killed the Japanese brigade commander and commander of the Jiujiang Garrison, Todo, and hundreds of others. On the same day, a part of the Japanese army invaded Wentou, southeast of Fengxin, and was repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties. After the remnants of the Japanese army on the east bank of Poyang Lake were defeated by the Chinese army, they retreated to the vicinity of Hukou. The Chinese army is now pursuing them. The Chinese army has achieved significant success using the tactic of accumulating great victories from small victories.</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi</p>
<p>The Chinese army continued to exert its power and expand its war results this week. On the morning of the 1st, they captured Dongzhang (south of Changzhi) and other places in Nansong Village, and advanced to the North Song Zhao Village area. They encountered the Japanese army that was invading southward under the cover of more than ten tanks and many aircraft. After the Chinese army charged, six Japanese vehicles were destroyed and more than 200 Japanese troops were killed. The remnants of the Japanese army retreated to Jincheng. On the evening of the 2nd, the Chinese army again launched attacks on Yincheng and Gaoping from the north and south, and successively captured Henghe. Shihanyu, Nei Wang Village (north of Gaoping) and other strongholds. Another unit also occupied Anxi Village (south of Changzhi) and other places, cutting off the Changgao Highway, destroying more than 10 Japanese cars, and killing more than 500 Japanese troops. On the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese army in Dajingguan tried to break through and escape, and launched multiple attacks on the area of ​​Qianhougetao, but were all defeated. On the morning of the 4th, the Japanese army that attacked the Lian Tie Lu (southwest of Jincheng) was repelled. After the Chinese army tracked them, they were forced to the line of Kongwuzhuang on the 5th and are now encircling and annihilating the remnants of the Japanese army using the superior terrain. On the same day, Japanese aircraft continuously bombed the area near 20 Li Pu and Zhou Village (west of Jincheng), and one aircraft was shot down. The fuselage was burned. At the moment, most of the outer strongholds of Jincheng and Yangcheng have been recovered by the Chinese army. The Chinese army is now besieging the city gate and it will not be difficult to annihilate them.</p>
<p>Other</p>
<p>In addition, the Chinese army in Suiyuan captured Yandeng and Zhaojun Tomb, both south of Baotou. Japanese anti-war elements in Jinan set fire to an ammunition depot in the city, causing losses of more than one million. On the 6th, Japanese aircraft attacked Sichuan and were shot down three heavy bombers and damaged many aircraft by the Chinese air force near Suiting. The Japanese pilots, including Second Class Airman Gongzang Hattori, and nine others were killed. In addition, the brave Chinese air force flew to Mingzhengdian and Oujiamiao in northern Yicheng, Hubei, and dropped giant bombs on the Japanese joint forces and the motorcade storing supplies, causing immediate destruction and achieving a remarkable victory.

<h3>A Wave of "Neutrality" at the Beginning of the European War (4)</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>(4) Italy's "Non-Participation" (September 18th, London)</p>
<p>In terms of basic attitude, the countries outside the European belligerents are quite different from each other. In the previous two paragraphs, I have roughly described the attitudes of Romania and Turkey. In fact, Romania and Turkey can barely be classified into one category, because in terms of inclination, they are obviously leaning towards Britain and France. Here, Italy will be described first, and Spain will be described in the next paragraph. These two countries are just the opposite of Romania and Turkey. In terms of inclination, they are leaning towards Germany, and further, we might as well say that they are participating in Germany's battle against Britain and France in a way of "not participating in the war"—especially Italy.</p>
<p>I repeat, Italy is participating in Germany's war against Britain and France in a posture of "non-participation."</p>
<p>Originally, in a simple German-Polish war, Italy's conservative "neutrality" could have been judged long ago in the days before the war. However, in case Britain and France declared war on Germany, what would Italy's attitude be? This was something that no one dared to determine twenty days ago, and it was also the question that everyone was most concerned about.</p>
<p>At that time, in the midst of heavy doubts, the diplomatic contacts between Germany and Italy were stepped up. As a result, rumors became more and more rampant. Among them, the most worrying rumor for Britain and France was that in case Britain and France declared war on Germany, the Italian army would immediately attack France from the Alps, and as corroborating evidence of this rumor, the Italian army was massively concentrated in the Po River basin.</p>
<p>As a result, Britain and France also began diplomatic activities towards Italy. The main intention was to find out the general attitude of Italy in the event that Britain and France declared war on Germany. However, the result of the inquiry was that nothing was achieved.</p>
<p>Then there was the war between Germany and Poland; and then Britain and France went to war with Germany.</p>
<p>In this way, it came to the most critical moment of whether Italy would participate in the war or not.</p>
<p>At that time, although Hitler had said on the German side that Italy's participation in the war was not needed for the time being; but on the British and French side, according to our inference from the various expressions at that time, probably even if Italy participated in the war, Britain and France were prepared to deal with it. Therefore, before obtaining the guarantee that Italy would not join, Britain and France took the risk of fighting against Germany and Italy, and directly declared war on Germany, and at the same time took various preventive measures against Italy. The most notable was the widespread distribution of the British and French navies in the Mediterranean Sea, followed by the increase of British and French armies in Africa and the Near East.</p>
<p>However, at this critical moment, the attitude of Italy, which Britain and France had spent a lot of effort to find out, gradually began to be revealed in some other things: (1) The curfew imposed to prevent aerial night raids suddenly relaxed, and some places even lifted it. (2) The air-raid shelters that were rushed to build in Italian cities suddenly began to be dismantled everywhere. (3) The opening hours of pubs and clubs returned to normal, and nightlife resumed. (4) The Italian-French border, which had been temporarily closed, has now been reopened. (5) The suspended international traffic in Eastern Europe has also completely returned to its former state, from Paris in the west to the Balkans in the east, and passing through Italy in the middle. (6) The various routes of Italian navigation in the Mediterranean and the ocean have not only returned to their former state, but also stepped up their business and raised their market prices. For example, the price of ships to the Far East has generally increased by more than one time. …</p>
<p>It is by no means an accidental phenomenon that the above-mentioned trivial matters, which are casually cited, occurred simultaneously within a short period of three to five days. It is explaining an important thing: Italy will definitely not participate in the war at present. If the estimate is more precise, it will probably not take war actions before the spring of 1940.</p>

<h3>Amidst Preparations for War, the Dynamics of Italian Overseas Chinese Officials and Civilians in Shanghai: The Ambassador Suspends Summer Vacation to Handle Important Official Affairs; No Changes in the Italian Military Defense Zone in Western Shanghai</h3>
<p>Italy's participation in the European war is imminent. All countries here are paying close attention to the future actions of the other party's military and government. After yesterday's visit, the dynamics of Italian overseas Chinese officials and civilians in Shanghai are recorded as follows. Italian Ambassador Ma Qiu, Consul General Na Nuni in Shanghai, and other officials of the embassy and consulate went to Beidaihe, Japan, and Dalian for summer vacation last summer, and returned to Shanghai one after another until September. Now it is summer again. The Italian consul originally planned to follow the example to go to other places for summer vacation. Now, because Italy's participation in the European war is becoming more and more imminent, according to frequent telegrams, Italy has deployed naval mines and all military measures in important areas of the Mediterranean Sea. Therefore, the Italian government officials stationed in Shanghai are staying in Shanghai and do not plan to go elsewhere. Whether they will leave Shanghai for summer vacation as usual in the near future depends on the dynamics of Italy in Europe before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>Ambassador's Advisor Arrives in Shanghai from Italy</p>
<p>Italian Ambassador's Advisor Shi Qu Nuo (C.A. Straneo) and Miss Xue Ge Nuo Lei, the niece of Robert Hart, the former Inspector General of the Chinese Customs, arrived in Shanghai last Friday on the Italian postal company's postal ship Kang Tuo Fo Tian. Shi's visit to Shanghai this time is to continue to serve as the ambassador's advisor. Amidst the tense situation in Europe, Shi's trip is attracting attention from the outside world.</p>
<p>The Embassy and Other Offices Are Still Working Yesterday</p>
<p>The Italian Embassy Office at No. 69, the Consulting Office, the Air Force Attaché Office, the First Secretary Office, the Second Secretary Office, the Counselor Office, the Consul General Office in Shanghai, the Consular Judge's Office, and the Italian Commercial Counselor Office at No. 26 The Bund, and the Italian Chamber of Commerce and other institutions were closed yesterday as it was Sunday as usual. However, in order to facilitate the receipt of information from the Italian government, only external office hours were suspended yesterday, while internal work was still handled by a part of the officials as usual.</p>
<p>Italian Troops in Western Shanghai Guard as Usual</p>
<p>Italy has a certain amount of interests in the concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin. Therefore, it has the same rights as Britain and France to have consuls and troops stationed there. The current Italian troops stationed in China are under the command of Sang Ma Ge. There are about 250 Italian troops stationed in the Italian concession in Tianjin. There are also about 250 people stationed in the western Shanghai area. The Da Guang reporter visited the Italian military defense zone yesterday and saw that the Italian barracks on Jiaozhou Road and the Italian military defense zone along Yaoshui Lane, Robert Sheng Road, Jiaozhou Road, Singapore Road, Caojiadu, and Fanwangdu were carrying out patrols and defense tasks as usual without any changes.</p>
<p>Even if Italy Participates in the War, It Will Not Affect the Concession</p>
<p>The Da Guang News Agency reporter learned from foreigners that people in China and abroad are paying close attention to the actions of Italian overseas Chinese amidst the preparations for Italy's participation in the war. Therefore, he specifically inquired from foreigners yesterday that the inherent rights of Italy in the Shanghai Public Concession will not be changed in any way even if Italy officially participates in the war in the future. At the same time, the British and American troops stationed there will cooperate to maintain the original state in order to maintain law and order. Moreover, Italian officials and civilians are staying in Shanghai as usual and have no plans to withdraw. The situation of Italian overseas Chinese in industry and commerce will also be operated as usual.</p>
<p>Appeal for Relief to European Refugees</p>
<p>As the European war expands, the areas where Belgium, the Netherlands, and northern France have fallen into the war zone are filled with refugees in France, reaching more than 5 million people, including 3 million refugees in northern France, 3 million Belgian refugees, and 100,000 refugees in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Because they fled in a hurry, they did not even have time to bring ordinary clothes, and they are in dire need of clothing and supplies, which is pitiful. Mrs. Gothsmer, the French Ambassador, and Mrs. Orin, the French Consul General, have launched a campaign to collect items, including clothes, shoes, socks, and bedding for men, women, old and young. Anyone who wants to donate can send them to Mrs. Gothsmer at No. 2 Gongguan Road, Mrs. Orin, or Mrs. Ru Dan at No. 23, Lane 753, Haige Road, Mrs. Ba Luo at No. 783, Xiafei Road, Apartment 78, Sawa at No. 133, Shanzhong Road, Mrs. Mo Lai Si Te at the Sacred Heart Convent, Mrs. Ruo Bei, Mrs. Mei Li Ai at No. 1920, Xiafei Road, and the Sacred Heart Road at No. 622, Xiafei Road. If you do not have time to send them to the above locations, you can call 84062-3, the French Shanghai Daily, and students from the Sacred Heart Convent in uniform will be sent to pick them up.</p>
<p>In addition, the donations from Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai to help Dutch refugees have reached a total of 87,633 yuan in national currency and 240 US dollars as of recently.</p>
<p>French Defense Fund Donations Are Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The Western employees of the French Concession Public Works Bureau automatically donated to the French National Defense Fund, totaling 33,924.58 yuan in national currency, and sent a letter to the French Consul Orin on the 6th of this month to transfer it to the Ministry of Finance in Paris. Senior officials of the French Concession Patrol Room also automatically decided to donate 10% or 12% of their salaries each month, and requested that Consul General Orin transfer them monthly. The Chinese members of the French Concession Fire Brigade also automatically donated 10% of their salaries, totaling 562.82 yuan in national currency, and sent a letter to Consul Orin from Luo Yeer, the captain of the fire brigade, to collect and transfer them. Orin sent a letter to Bai Di'an, the general manager of the Public Works Bureau, Fa Po, the chief of the patrol room, and Luo Yeer, the president of the fire brigade, to express his gratitude to the members of their departments. It is also reported that the donations for comfort items raised by French overseas Chinese in Shanghai are very satisfactory. Many Frenchmen donate monthly. As of recently, a total of 81,990.27 yuan in national currency, 271,085 French francs, and 280 US dollars have been raised.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Cherishes the Youth of Shanghai and Is Extremely Concerned About Compatriots in the Occupied Areas; Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing, Further Strengthening the Will to Resist</h3>
<p>According to a gentleman from Chongqing to Shanghai, Chongqing does not attach importance to the recent rumors in Shanghai about peace between China and Japan. This is a common trick of a certain party. Spreading such rumors is not the first time and is not worth mentioning at all. Talking about the Japanese planes attacking Chongqing for days, bombing indiscriminately, and indiscriminately bombing undefended areas, massacring civilians, and being inhuman, the people are not alarmed by the bombing of Japanese planes. Whenever they hear the alarm, women and children mostly flee into air-raid shelters first. At the same time, air-raid defense teams, fire brigades, and ambulance teams are also dispatched at any time, and the order is good. Although the Japanese planes bomb willfully, the general people are not only not intimidated, but also more determined to resist the war, and deeply believe that they will win the final victory, and this blood debt will surely be settled one day. Finally, the gentleman also told the reporter that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is very concerned about the compatriots in the occupied areas, especially the general youth in Shanghai, and has high hopes for them. During this national crisis, there are still some people who are distressed by the existence of dance halls and bars.</p>
<h3>Abe Convenes Japanese Consular Conference; Fu Xiaoan Has No Definite Affirmative Attitude on the "Special Police" Matter</h3>
<p>According to reliable information obtained by the Da Guang News Agency reporter from foreigners, after the Japanese side sent Abe Nobuyuki and others to China, in order to understand all the circumstances of the military, political, and economic aspects of the occupied areas, Abe specifically convened a Japanese Consul General conference in various parts of China in the capacity of "Ambassador" to listen to reports for the purpose of making further preparations for invading China. It is heard that the meeting will be held on the 10th and 11th of this month in Nanjing. The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Miura, went to attend by Japanese military plane yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Demanding Cooperation</p>
<p>The puppet "Mayor" Fu Xiaoan openly made a statement to Western reporters the day before yesterday, demanding that the authorities of the two concessions "cooperate closely" with him. It is said that the "Municipal Government" is now willing to implement "real cooperation" with the authorities of the two concessions. The relationship between the puppet "Municipal Government" and the Public Works Bureau does not seem to be very close. Therefore, he hopes that the authorities of the Public Concession can strengthen cooperation with it.</p>
<p>Special Police Issue</p>
<p>When talking about the "special police issue" on the extra-territorial roads, he hesitated and evaded the question. Regarding the establishment date of the "special police," he only said, "I hope it will be established in the near future." However, he indicated that there seem to be some other issues before the issue of police power on the extra-territorial roads can be resolved, and the opinions of both sides have not yet reached a consensus.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Minister to Japan Left Shanghai for Tokyo Yesterday</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the newly appointed Egyptian Minister to Japan, Bey, left Shanghai on the 6th of this month.

<h3>Inheritance Tax and Wartime Excess Profits Tax Will Be Levied Starting Next Month</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that the levy of direct taxes can best adapt to the taxpayer's ability to pay taxes, and is generally suitable for the tax principles discussed by scholars. Therefore, its position of residing can be seen as increasingly important. The income tax has not been established for a long time, and it has already achieved preliminary success. Therefore, a direct tax office has been established to handle the collection of various direct taxes. Now the inheritance tax and wartime excess profits tax are ready and will be implemented starting on the 1st of next month. (1) All preparations for the levy of inheritance tax are ready. For example, property investigation, uniform account names, and household registration are all under planning. The most difficult inheritance evaluation method and the application forms for collection have been determined. This direct good tax has been deeply supported by the people. In the future, we can follow this effort and echo the tax systems of advanced countries. (2) Wartime excess profits tax increases tax revenue to enrich war expenses, which is still in its decision, but its important significance lies in realizing the patriotic principle of paying money when you have money and balancing the social burden. Although this measure is a temporary measure during the war of resistance, it is actually an important page in the history of tax system reform and cannot be ignored.</p>
<h3>The Italian Ship Kang Tie Fo Tian Will Move to the Pontoon Today; The Decision to Load Passengers and Goods Will Be Handled by Customs Refund; Will Stay in Shanghai for a Considerable Period of Time</h3>
<p>The Italian postal ship Kang Tie Fo Tian was ordered by the Roman government to stop all Italian mails traveling en route at neutral ports. The ship then stopped sailing back to Europe. It is now learned that the ship is scheduled to move from the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou to the Pujiang Pontoon today. Although the future actions have not been decided, the company's direction has decided to refund tickets and customs duties for all passengers and goods loaded to Europe. The Xinsheng News Agency reporter continued to record the details as follows:</p>
<p>Moving to the Pontoon</p>
<p>After Kang Dai Fo Tian Lun was ordered to temporarily dock at a neutral port to await orders, the company officially announced yesterday that the departure date had been changed, and said that it would be announced again after the date was determined. Yesterday, as of the evening, the ship was still berthed at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou. However, according to the person in charge of the company, the company decided to move the ship to the Pujiang Pontoon today because the place is a British wharf, and then wait for orders quietly.</p>
<p>Ticket and Customs Refund</p>
<p>Regarding the goods that the ship has already contacted to be loaded and transported to Hong Kong, Nanyang, and various ports in Europe, and the passenger tickets that have been sold, the company has decided to refund all freight and passenger tickets because even if it is ordered to leave Shanghai, it will not stop at the countries along the way according to the original route. This notice will be published in one or two days. As for the more than 100 tons of goods transported to Shanghai a few days ago, they have been completely unloaded.</p>
<p>Temporarily Staying in Shanghai</p>
<p>As for the whereabouts of the ship in the future, the Italian Postal Company sent a telegram to the Roman government a few days ago, asking for instructions. As of last night, the company had not received a reply. Therefore, it cannot be decided where the ship will be berthed in the future. According to general observation, if the ship leaves Shanghai, it will inevitably pass through Hong Kong and the British territories in Nanyang. At present, navigation is not hindered in any way, but it cannot be reconciled with the order to dock at neutral ports. Therefore, the ship may stay in Shanghai for a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>Changing to US Dollars</p>
<p>According to shipping industry news, after the European situation became tense, the Italian ships sailing to the Americas and the Far East no longer used Italian currency but switched to US dollars. This time, when the Kang Tie Fo Tian Lun left Europe, passengers were required to purchase tickets in US dollars. The fares to China were uniformly sold at 170 US dollars for third-class tickets, which is equivalent to more than 3,000 Chinese yuan, which is unprecedentedly expensive. Food was also bought and sold on board in US dollars, and Italian currency could no longer be used. According to the crew, this is because the company also needs to purchase goods from various places in US dollars.</p>
<p>Captain's Statement</p>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News reported that the Japanese "Mainland News" reported that the Italian postal ship Kang Tuo Fo Tian, which was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 9th and sail back to Genoa, Italy, has now postponed its departure and will be berthed indefinitely at a Japanese wharf instead of a British wharf. According to the captain of the ship, "The Mainland News" reporter said that although Italian cargo ships will maintain regular sailings, the Italian passenger ships sailing to Shanghai will probably be the last one of the Kang Tuo Fo Tian. As for the political significance of the ship's suspension of sailings, he cannot comment or explain. He believes that the ship's suspension of sailings is an indication that Italy is about to participate in the war. Now all matters are in the hands of the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, and the Italian people are prepared to follow the orders of their leader.</p>
<p>German Peace Sailing Town</p>
<p>Italian merchant ships sailing within Chinese territorial waters are still sailing as usual. The German Peace Lun of the Italian merchant Zhongyi Company left Shanghai for Zhenhai at 5 pm yesterday. It is reported that this type of sailing ship is different because it sails within the territorial waters of neutral countries. Therefore, even if Italy participates in the war, it may not be affected in any way. Just like German merchant ships sailing in China, they will sail as usual.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Telegraphs Negotiated the Tianjin Issue; Japan Hopes that Britain Will Change its Entire North China Policy; Even if Silver is Resolved, It Is Difficult to Fill the Japanese People's Abyss of Desire</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin West News on June 8, Tokyo Telegraphs, said that the British Ambassador here and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs both told reporters today that Britain and Japan can probably negotiate an agreement on the British Concession in Tianjin within two weeks. According to the British Embassy spokesperson, there are still some points that have not been resolved, but these outstanding cases are expected to be negotiated quickly. The issue of removing the Tianjin Concession blockade,</p>
<p>Seems Quite Ambiguous</p>
<p>The attitude that the Japanese side has held so far is that if Britain wants to cancel the blockade, it should change its policy on the entire North China issue and cooperate sincerely with the Japanese people. The Japanese Ministry of the Army said that the Japanese side generally has a tendency to temporarily not abolish the blockade. The point to be resolved is not only</p>
<p>The silver in the concession, but the Japanese side is also seeking the cooperation of Britain. The British Embassy spokesperson also said that he cannot断言 on the matter of the blockade being lifted, and the exact amount of silver in the concession has not been determined. If the blockade is not lifted, then the silver issue, even if it is negotiated, is still不得告知 .</p>
<p>Bilateral Negotiations</p>
<p>Of course, efforts have been made to delay the European war in London and Paris. However, at present, the difficulty of the situation is that the Japanese attitude has indeed slowed down. The agreement in the proposals of both sides stipulates that the British Concession will hand over silver worth 100,000 pounds in British gold and the French Concession will hand over silver worth 200,000 pounds in British gold.</p>
<p>Purchasing Australian Wheat</p>
<p>To relieve the people of North China, the remaining silver will be sealed by the British, Japanese, and French Japanese consultations. Sir 克莱琪, the British Ambassador to Japan, also seems to represent the French government. The Japanese Ministry of the Army told reporters that the negotiations do not involve the return of the concession. When the time for returning the concession arrives, Japan may take the lead in this.</p>
<h3>Polish Overseas Chinese Citizen Min Shi Broadcast the Night Before, Revealing German Propaganda Methods, the Fifth Column Secretly Deployed Everywhere</h3>
<p>Polish overseas Chinese Pi Chen Shi broadcast the night before last at the French radio station in Shanghai, revealing how the Nazis trained the German people's fighting spirit and prepared to launch a war before the Second European War. The German authorities used various propaganda methods in advance to calm the hearts of the people in the civilized countries so that they would not suspect what actions the German side was preparing to take in the future. Pi Chen Shi specifically raised the views of the Nazi military theorist Pang Xi. Pang said that we are engaged in fighting with military, economic, and spiritual weapons, among which spiritual weapons are especially important. All social problems are still within the scope of spiritual problems based on the final analysis. Therefore, we must</p>
<p>Launching a war 对一 publicity matters, but we should not 为 为 岸月 can be收所 落良之宣传 after years of work, it must be创始侯 war started during peacetime, then we will see its significance immediately is the only 大 successful. Pang Xi also advocated the establishment of German overseas Chinese organizations in various parts of the world. All German overseas Chinese abroad were forced to participate. The organization is the总 source of all Nazis. The organization also established a "Fifth Column." In the Norwegian campaign, its horrific activities were evident. Pi Chen Shi continued to say that the Fifth Column is also one of the modern warfare methods, and its branches are located in various countries around the world. They first contacted the writers of various countries, and then used newspapers, movies, and radio broadcasts to exert the power of their propaganda. Other establishment of clubs, social groups, and reading rooms are also media to achieve the purpose of propaganda. Nazis</p>
<p>Foreign organizations are actually merged into German diplomatic agencies, and their activities enjoy diplomacy protection. Before 1937, the German authorities still pretended that they were not related to the Nazi Party's foreign organizations, but in January 1937, they formally recognized that the organizations had the right to manage the behavior of German foreigners in the country where they were located and other matters. In the summer of the same year, the relationship between German diplomatic authorities and foreign organizations became increasingly closer.</p>
<h3>Soldiers Injured in the War of Resistance are Called "Honorary Soldiers" and 除 are 行</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Internal Affairs informed the governments of 各 cities and counties that the management office of the Central Government 兵 presented a report transferred by the參 General Staff 长 He and signed by Minister Chen of the Political Department. The report stated that soldiers injured in the War of Resistance were uniformly called 残废军人. We believe that this title will have an adverse impact on the morale of the soldiers and is not a way to respect the soldiers who fought in the War of Resistance. It is proposed that the words残废 should be abolished and changed to "Honorary Soldiers." The wound administration agencies named after 残废 should also be changed accordingly. "The case has been approved after the office drafted the renamed照表, the report said, and should be handled accordingly. It is hereby ordered that all wounded administration agencies should comply.</p>
<h3>Inferior Food Found in the French Concession: Milk is Infiltrated with Water and Drinks are Made with Dyes; Many Counterfeit Wines are Sold and are Heavily Punished</h3>
<p>At the beginning of last month, the exchange rate in Shanghai changed drastically and prices soared. Many unscrupulous merchants who only sought profit擅 changed the instruments of weights and measures and used people to enrich themselves. In order to crack down on this illegal act, the French Concession authorities not only formulated a new system of weights and measures and announced implementation, but also severely punished merchants who violated the system and changed it privately. According to the平价 Committee of the French Concession, the inspection of food is as follows: (1) The following violations of meat were reported: seven cases of selling buffalo meat, nine cases of selling meat that was stamped and then wiped off, two cases of selling second-class meat, and three cases of selling meat that was not stamped. (2) For milk, three samples were extracted, and it was found that there was 5% infiltration of water, which was fined 300 yuan.

<h3>Yesterday Afternoon's Major Fire on Yidingpan Road Spread to Forty or Fifty Buildings, Destroyed a Fire Engine, and Injured a Total of Eight People</h3>
<p>Around 11:17 AM yesterday, a major fire suddenly broke out at the southeastern corner of Yidingpan Road, a road built beyond the boundary in western Shanghai, and extended to forty or fifty buildings. A fire engine was damaged by the flames, and five firefighters from various fire brigades were injured and sent to the Public Concession hospital for treatment. The fire was finally extinguished around 2:30 PM. The details of the affected properties are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Raging Flames</p>
<p>Around 11:17 AM yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the residential buildings east of Xidingpan Road. Black smoke billowed and flames raged, visible from a distance. The newly built houses along the road were mostly single-story wooden structures. Combined with the drought and dry weather, once ignited, the fire was difficult to control. The Local and Road Fire Brigade, the Central Fire Brigade, the Caojiadu Fire Brigade, and the News Fire Brigade all rushed pumper trucks to the scene to put out the fire. However, the fire spread rapidly, and their efforts were like a drop in the bucket. By 2:30 PM, the fire had not been completely extinguished, and more than a hundred households were affected.</p>
<p>Several People Injured</p>
<p>During the height of the fire, fire engine number 40, "Ceng Hai Ting," was damaged by the flames, and its machinery was damaged beyond repair. The arm of the car's driver was also burned. At the same time, firefighters from various districts bravely rescued people, resulting in injuries to five people, including those with numbers 501, 44, 360, 649, and 748, who suffered burns to their hands, arms, and heads. They were transported to the Public Concession Hospital. In addition, three residents were injured and sought treatment at the hospital on their own.</p>
<p>Affected Households</p>
<p>Information reveals that the affected households include the Wan Ronghua Coal Company at number 804 (entire building), the Da Xin Auto Repair Shop at number 806, and the Fu Yuan Pawnshop at numbers 808-810, the facade of which remained relatively intact, but the interior was completely destroyed, causing significant losses. The fire also spread to number 711 Xin Ji Hardware Store, number 707 Yuan He Lumber, Hua Tai Paint Store, Da Sheng Tea Shop, and Guang Sheng Sand Shop on Yidingpan Road, all of which were almost completely destroyed. Other businesses, such as barber shops, enamelware stores, flour shops, dyeing shops, and dozens of residences, were also affected. However, the shop signs and names were destroyed, making it difficult to identify them immediately. The fire lasted for more than four hours. As of 7:30 PM, the fire brigades were still sifting through the rubble. The police department is still conducting a thorough investigation into the cause of the fire and who was responsible.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Incident on Hongqiao Road</h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday, a man, dressed in a light gray silk gown, wearing a straw hat and glasses, and appearing to be in his forties, was riding in a rickshaw on Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai, traveling from west to east. When he reached the intersection of Da Xi Road, three young men – two in Western suits and one in blue cloth shirt and pants – suddenly appeared with pistols and stopped him. They dragged the man from the rickshaw and kidnapped him, heading north (towards Huobi Road). The name of the kidnapped person and the original details could not be ascertained.</p>

<h3>Arrest of Old Yu Tai Hotel Owner and Others; Manager's Heavy Gambling Debts Neglecting Business; Customers' Large Orders of Shaoxing Wine Cannot Be Delivered</h3>
<p>The Old Yu Tai Hotel at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Shantou Road was founded by Tang Jiapeng, also known as Tang A'yu, who was assassinated many years ago. The ownership of the hotel has changed hands several times. Last year, a Mr. Chen from Changzhou took over the business. Not long after, the owner fell ill and passed away. The business was managed by his son-in-law, Gong Guoliang from Suzhou, with Zhu Runan as assistant manager. They promoted the business, engaging not only in retail but also in wholesale of Shaoxing wine. Recently, Yong Fu Chang, Tong Feng Hao, Bi Hu Xuan, Zhang Yu Tang Zhang Wenzheng, Wu Chuan Zhong, Hua Gen Zhi, Ma Bai Tang, Shen Ai Tang and other ten firms ordered large quantities of Shaoxing wine from the Old Yu Tai Hotel through managers Gong Guoliang and Zhu Runan, worth tens of thousands of taels. They paid Gong and Zhu over 21,000 yuan as deposit. Both parties signed contracts, stamped with the Old Yu Tai seal, with delivery scheduled before the Dragon Boat Festival. However, Gong had been frequenting gambling dens in western Shanghai, incurring heavy losses. Unable to raise funds to fulfill the delivery, he left the store without saying goodbye. Upon discovering Gong's departure and the large wine orders, the hotel commissioned lawyer Yang Junlin to publish a statement in the newspaper, stating that Gong Guoliang's affairs were his sole responsibility and not related to the hotel. Seeing the notice, Yong Fu Chang and the other ten firms jointly commissioned lawyer Zhang Shibeng to publish a rebuttal in the newspaper and reported to the police that the hotel owner, the widow Mrs. Chen, and managers Gong and Zhu were engaged in a joint fraud. The police arrested only assistant manager Zhu Runan. Later, they collaborated with the French police to arrest the hotel owner and Mrs. Chen on Rue Paul Beau (蒲柏路), pending transfer to the court for prosecution. Meanwhile, they are searching for the absconding Gong Guoliang to bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Two Convicted of Abducting Women Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Tong Rende, a well-known tourist guide from Ningbo and owner of the Shanghai Guang Tourist Guide Agency, recently established in Nanjing's Confucius Temple street, catered to clients seeking pleasure. He partnered with Wu Jincheng from Tongzhou, who specialized in luring women into prostitution. They opened room 25 in the Jiangxin Hotel at 40 North Shanxi Road. They lured ten women, including Mao Aidi and Lu Zhoushi, to the hotel, giving them tens of dollars each to stay in the room temporarily, falsely claiming they were looking for tourists. They did not explicitly mention going to Nanjing to engage in prostitution. It was only in late last month, when they were asked to obtain permits and take photos in a certain area of Hongkou, with the threat of immediate repayment of the money if they refused, that the women realized they had been deceived and had no choice but to obey Tong and Wu. On the morning of the 22nd, at 4:00 AM, just as they were about to depart for Nanjing, detectives Wu Dekui and Hao Shangqin from the Gordon Road police station uncovered the case and arrested Tong Rende and Wu Jincheng. The ten women, including Mao, were sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Two of the women, Lu Didi from Ningbo and Li Qingmei and Li Qingxia from Jiangsu, were claimed by their mothers, Lu Ye and Li Wang. The others are temporarily staying at the Women and Children Relief Association. The case was further heard by Judge Huang Risheng in court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian stated that the families of Mao Aidi, Mao Juzhen, Wang Manna, and Yuan Genbao were present in court to claim them, while the others remained at the Relief Association, pending claim by their relatives. He requested punishment for the two defendants. Judge Huang, after questioning, sentenced Tong Rende and Wu Jincheng to six months imprisonment as a warning. Mao Aidi, Mao Juzhen, Wang Manna, and Yuan Genbao were allowed to be claimed by Wang Yanshi, Yuan Wangshi, and Yang Gushi (Mao's aunt), while Zhou Baiyun, Chen Cuiying, and Lu Zhoushi remained at the Women and Children Relief Association pending claim.</p>
<h3>Car Accident on Jing'an Temple Road Injured Three People</h3>
<p>At approximately 6:40 PM yesterday, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple and Carter Road, a couple in their forties, along with a boy of about ten years old, were crossing the road from south to north when a black private car, number 19688, speeding from east to west, struck them. The couple were holding hands and hesitated upon seeing the car approaching, unable to avoid it. All three were knocked down and seriously injured, bleeding profusely. Nearby officers rushed to the scene, recorded the car's number, and sent the three injured people to the hospital for treatment. According to witnesses, the woman suffered the most severe head injuries.</p>
<h3>Defendants in Abortion Causing Death Case Await Sentencing</h3>
<p>Peng Yangshi, a local woman residing at 120 Glen Road in Yangshupu, discovered that her eighteen-year-old daughter, Peng Genhuo, a worker at the China Soap Factory on Yangshupu Road, was pregnant despite being unmarried. Her mother, Peng Yangshi, discovered her daughter's secret on May 20th. Concerned about her reputation, she discussed an abortion with her uncle-in-law, Lu Delin, and entrusted Liu Huangshi, an obstetrician residing at 17 Lane 795 Pingliang Road, to perform the abortion for a fee of 40 yuan, with an initial payment of 20 yuan. Room 36 was booked at the Quan'an Hotel on Yangshupu Road. A tube of "duijie grass" was inserted into the daughter's private area, but due to unskilled surgery, the fetus did not descend, and Peng died on the night of the 23rd. The hotel staff reported to the Yulin Road police station, who sent detective Zhang Yunhong to take the body to the mortuary. Peng Yangshi, Lu Delin, Liu Huangshi, and an old woman, Huang Qishi, were arrested and sent to the First Special Court for trial. The case was further heard by Judge Liu in the Third Criminal Court the day before yesterday. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed charges according to the law, stating that during the adjournment, the court had received an anonymous letter alleging that the deceased had been strangled, and the police had been instructed to investigate. The investigation revealed that the marks on the deceased's neck were due to the "ti sha" (提痧) treatment performed by Huang Qishi and others to relieve her "fa sha" (發痧) ailment. The German medical report also stated that the death was caused by the abortion. When questioned, Liu Huangshi admitted to performing the abortion, while the other defendants gave evasive answers and hired lawyers such as Zheng Wenkai to defend them. The court ordered that the case be adjourned and sentenced next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>Opening of the Neuropsychiatric Treatment Center Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Neuropsychiatric Treatment Center, jointly established by the World Red Swastika Society and the Shanghai Mental Hygiene Promotion Association, was officially opened yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Red Swastika Society Hospital at 1171 YuYuan Road.

<h3>The Second Special District Court Interrogated the Trafficking Case Yesterday, Alleging That the Abductors Carried Belts</h3>
<p>In April, the Jiaxing Road police uncovered a major trafficking gang, arresting ten men and women, including the trafficker Ling Rongsen. It was found that they had abducted more than 150 boys and girls, who were sent to the First Special District Court for prosecution and sentenced to heavy prison terms. Because the gang had also committed similar abductions within the French Concession, the French police sent detectives to the First Special District Court to transfer the traffickers Ling Rongsen, Ling Zhangshi, Dai Lushi, Wang Lishi, Wang Wushi, Zhuge Qianshi, Zhuge Chun, Lu Wenzhong, Wang Zhangshi, and Cui Tengshi to the Second Special District Court for interrogation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun continued the hearing in the First Criminal Court. Police lawyer Chen Ming reported on the investigation and charged the defendants with abducting males under the age of sixteen from their families for the purpose of profit. Then, the investigating detective Yan Jinwen reported that the number of victims reported in this case exceeded one hundred. Six victims appeared in court today and requested to be questioned. The defendant Ling Rongsen confessed in court that he lived at 355 Baoding Road and sent the abducted children to Xiamen to be sold to Su Deshan, who lived at 29 Shuixian Road, for about 100 yuan per child. When questioned, the other defendants were evasive. The court also questioned the victims one by one. Due to the importance of the case and the need for further investigation, the hearing was adjourned to the 20th of this month. The defendants were taken into custody. After the court adjourned, the victims, filled with hatred for the defendants who had torn their families apart, followed and tried to bite them to vent their anger. They were stopped and dispersed by the French police and the bailiffs, and the defendants were able to escape to the detention center.</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education's Improvements to Wartime Local and Elementary Social Education (2): Regarding the Restoration of Educational Administrative Institutions in Occupied Counties</h3>
<p>By the first semester of the 28th academic year, the attached elementary school of Shihuxian Teachers' School, such as the attached elementary school of Rushixian Teachers' School, and Futong Elementary School had successively resumed classes on their own. However, how to appropriately locate the schools and determine the number of grades to meet the needs of each area required re-adjustment based on the actual situation in each location. Therefore, at the beginning of this semester, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education changed the names of the affiliated elementary schools of the provincial Huaishi Rushixian Teachers' School, Haishi JieShouxian Teachers' School, Shihuxian Teachers' School, and Zaoyan Teachers' School, as well as the Luxun elementary schools in Nantong, to Provincial First to Eighth Temporary Elementary Schools. The Department considered the local situation, changed the location of the schools, and stipulated the number of grades. The Department also added a ninth provincial temporary elementary school in the Xu area and promulgated the Regulations for the Establishment of Provincial Temporary Elementary Schools in Jiangsu and the Guidelines for Central Work to each school for compliance.</p>
<p>(4) Running Elementary School Teacher Training Classes and War Zone Elementary School Teacher Training Groups. Elementary education in Jiangsu Province originally had a solid foundation. However, since the outbreak of the war, teachers have been displaced and relocated, and the quality of teachers has been uneven. Some teachers had been in service for many years and lacked motivation, while others lacked qualifications and filled positions without competence. The Jiangsu Department of Education, recognizing this and the urgent need to prepare for the promotion of national education, specially formulated temporary measures for elementary school teacher training classes in each county and temporary measures for mobile training groups for elementary school graduates in war zone counties in order to improve the quality of elementary school teachers and refresh the spirit of elementary education. These measures were ordered to be implemented in each county, and teachers were uniformly provided with short-term training to enhance their effectiveness in the war of resistance and national construction, thereby improving elementary schools in each county throughout the province and preparing for the promotion of national education. This measure has significant implications for the future of education in each county. (5) Restore the Dongtai Dafeng Reclamation Area Moral Education Experimental Zone. The Dongtai Dafeng Reclamation Area Moral Education Experimental Zone was originally headed by personnel from the Jiangsu Department of Education in the 26th year of the Republic. Later, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Dongtai was occupied ten times, and Japanese troops harassed the towns in the reclamation area. The district was forced to temporarily suspend operations, and all education in the reclamation area was managed by the county education bureau. However, the area was located in a remote coastal area, making it inconvenient for the education bureau to manage. In order to meet the needs, the Jiangsu Department of Education specially restored the moral education experimental zone, establishing a management committee in March and appointing Ji Zhenru, the former director of the Dongtai Education Bureau, as the director of the district. From then on, the moral education in the district can gradually expand in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>(6) Vigorously Promote Compulsory Education. Investigations have found that more than a dozen counties in northern Jiangsu have increased the number of compulsory education classes this year, with 657 new classes added. In areas occupied and where compulsory education classes cannot be established, local people are encouraged to establish charity schools to implement compulsory education, and subsidies are provided according to their performance.</p>
<p>(7) Unify and Improve Private Tutoring Education. Before the war, government offices in various counties of Jiangsu Province had made various efforts to ban private tutoring schools. To date, the number of private tutoring schools in each county has not decreased much. In fact, if private tutoring schools are properly managed, it may not be impossible to transform the bad into the good, and the bitter fruit into sweet. Turning all private tutoring schools into standard elementary schools or charity schools is a matter of transition. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education specially issued the "General Outline of the Jiangsu Province's Plan to Unify and Improve Private Tutoring Education" this semester in order to actively improve private tutoring education in each county throughout the province and achieve the effectiveness of supplementing compulsory education. Temporary measures for guiding private tutoring schools in each county and temporary measures for teacher training classes in each county are also formulated. It is expected that after the summer vacation this year, not only can the progress of private tutoring education in each county be expected, but most of the tutors, after training, can be used as teacher resources for the future promotion of national education. Truly a win-win situation.</p>
<p>(8) Adjust Elementary School Teachers in Each County. Since the Great War, the supply and demand of elementary school teachers in northern Jiangsu has often been unable to meet the needs. In general, it is not easy to find adequate work for elementary school teachers in counties that have been heavily affected by the war. Recognizing this, the Jiangsu Department of Education specially formulated "Temporary Measures for Adjusting Elementary School Teachers in Each County" in order to ensure that the supply and demand of elementary school teachers in each county is suitable and the distribution is balanced. Before the start of each semester, the Education Bureau of each county should conduct a general registration of all elementary school teachers in the county and try to appoint all qualified teachers in the county. If there is a shortage, the lack of teachers should be reported to the Department for unified allocation. Since the implementation, there has been no phenomenon of surplus or shortage of teachers in each county.</p>
<p>(9) Plan and Promote National Education. Since the central government stipulated that national education will be implemented from August this year, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education is actively preparing in accordance with the steps stipulated by the Ministry of Education. The following has been carried out: (1) Printing and distributing the Outline for the Implementation of National Education promulgated by the Ministry of Education; (2) Formulating forms to investigate the population, number of townships and guarantees, number of schools, number of grades, number of students, funding and teacher resources in each county throughout the province, and setting a deadline for filling in the forms; (3) Formulating the "Jiangsu Province's Plan for Implementing National Education", which has been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval, stipulating the steps for implementing national education in five years. At the same time, a plan for training and cultivating teachers is being drafted in order to store a large number of teacher resources for the preparation for the phased promotion of national education.</p>
<p>(10) Compile and Print Elementary School War of Resistance Teaching Materials. Because the traffic between the counties in northern Jiangsu and Shanghai is blocked, the students in schools in each county need textbooks at the beginning of the semester, and it is almost impossible to supply them. In addition to a few entrusting bookstores to find ways to purchase them, most of them are mimeographed by themselves or entrusted to printing houses for printing. Also, the content of the textbooks often loses its meaning of the times and does not meet the current needs. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education originally had a compilation and review office, which started editing this semester. The elementary school war of resistance teaching materials recently completed include the Chinese language common sense textbook for the middle grades of elementary school and the advanced Chinese language social textbook. The counties have now been notified and the number of copies needed in each county has been surveyed in order to count and print them. In addition to compiling the above-mentioned textbooks, the compilation and review office has also reviewed various literacy textbooks for the people submitted by each county, and the work is quite intense.</p>

<h3>Small Football Tournament a Complete Success: Tung Tze-lai Wins Group A Championship; Kau Lin's Physical Strength Proves Insufficient, Resulting in a 1-3 Loss; Jewish Club Wins Group B Championship</h3>
<p>The second annual Aurora Cup small football tournament concluded successfully yesterday after the Group A and B finals. The competition lasted for a month and a half, with 38 teams participating, not including international matches. All championship titles have now been awarded, with only the Manfu Cup charity match to be held next Saturday. The championship winners are as follows:</p>
<p>International Cup Championship - China Team (donated by the Deputy Brazilian Consul in Shanghai, Carloni). Group A League Championship - Tung Tze-lai (donated by Aurora University). Group B League Championship - Jewish Club (donated by Mr. Tao Jinrong). Yesterday's two finals both produced unexpected results. The Russian expatriate team was defeated by the Jewish team, suffering a shutout. In the Group A championship battle between Kau Lin and Tung Tze-lai, the Kau Lin players suffered from inferior physical strength. Clever tactics could not overcome brute force, resulting in a painful 1-3 loss. This clearly demonstrates that in sports, physical strength is the key to success or failure, while technical skill is only a small part of the equation. After the matches, Mr. Tao Jinrong, donor of the Shun Kee Cup (Group B), and Father Li, representative of Aurora University, donor of the Aurora Cup (Group A), presented the awards. Kau Lin also received a Citibank Cup, while Tung Tze-lai, in addition to winning the overall championship, also received a "French Water Cup" donated by Mr. Tu Zhongbao. The match reports are as follows:</p>
<p>Kau Lin vs. Tung Tze-lai Dramatic Battle Report</p>
<p>Kau Lin suffered a significant loss in strength due to Chen Ji-zhi's inability to play. From the start, Tung Tze-lai launched a fierce attack, but Kau Lin's defense was effective, with Qin Bi-gao making numerous saves. The two sides were evenly matched, holding each other off for more than twenty minutes, with neither side able to score. In the twenty-fifth minute, Tung Tze-lai launched a fierce attack. Yue Renxiao, eager to defend, committed a foul in the penalty area. [ ] took the penalty kick. Kau Lin was fortunate to avoid [ ]. Tung Tze-lai took a 1-0 lead in the first half. Tung Tze-lai's Huang Mao Maikelade [ ], had already suffered an ankle injury in the previous final [ ]. Yesterday, the old injury recurred, and he was replaced by Austin. After switching sides, Kau Lin was still under pressure due to their inferior physical strength. After about ten minutes, Yue Renxiao missed a tackle, and Pal rushed into the gap [ ], headed the ball [ ], Tung Tze-lai volleyed the shot, Qin Bi-gao was unable to save it. Kau Lin conceded two goals in a row, and launched a counterattack, but unfortunately, every time they reached a critical moment, they were intercepted. Until the last five minutes, Gao Baozheng took a corner kick, sending the ball directly to the left side, 30 yards out. Yue Renxiao, without waiting for the ball to stop, volleyed it directly into the left corner. Mao Liesi was caught off guard, and Kau Lin pulled one back. Yue Renxiao's shot was met with thunderous applause. After this, Kau Lin's counterattack became more urgent, hoping to tie the game, but their luck was not good. Xiao Xintian and Gao Baozheng made two excellent tackles, but both shots flew high and wide of the right corner. With the entire team committed to the attack, the defense was exposed. Austin sent a long pass, and the Kau Lin players mistakenly thought it was offside and ignored it. Unexpectedly, Jielai rushed in like a flash of lightning. Qin Bi-gao was isolated and helpless and was shot into the empty net. Thus, Kau Lin's fate was sealed. Soon after, the whistle blew, and Tung Tze-lai won the Group A championship with a score of 3-1.</p>

<h3>How to Promote Foreign Trade: Summary of Records of a Seminar Jointly Organized by This Publication and the Economic Research Department of Global Trust Company</h3>
<p>The previous issue has already published the two sections "International Trade and National Economy" (speakers included Chairman Lu Zhixue, Zhang Yifan, and Yao Qingsan) and "The Current Trade Environment in Our Country" (speakers included Chairman Yu Zhongkui, Zhang Yifan, Li Shifan, and Wu Yugan), as well as the insightful remarks by Chairman, Gan Dounan, and Nie Guangdi in the section "Promoting Trade and Finance." This issue continues to publish the rest of the article to complete the whole picture. (Editor's Note)</p>
<p>Wu Wenying, Xu Shimin, Yang Dehui</p>
<p>Li Shoulu: My brother and I once received an export order and requested a loan from the Huashang Bank. They said, "The interest on buying foreign exchange is much greater than the interest on lending," so they refused. On the contrary, foreign banks are sometimes willing to help us a little. The solution to this problem is only through government orders. The development of the export business can only be achieved with the help of Huashang Banks.</p>
<p>Lu Xilin: Banks do not completely refuse to provide credit loans. The reason why they cannot do so on a large scale is that banks themselves have many difficulties. Because financial fluctuations in Shanghai are severe and there are many risks involved in exports, banks have to tighten credit loans to the general industrial and commercial sectors. As for customers with a long history of dealing with the bank, they still do so. The industrial and commercial sectors are wronged when they blame the banks for not lending. It is absolutely impossible for banks not to lend. More imports lead to a reduction in foreign exchange. However, the reason for the current reduction in foreign exchange is not entirely due to more imports. The majority is due to speculation. If speculation does not stop, finance cannot be stabilized. If finance is not stable, banks cannot lend on a large scale. Therefore, the core issue is that the banking sector does not "settle forward foreign exchange" for speculators. Not settling forward foreign exchange can reduce speculation. However, it is not easy to do so in this special environment.</p>
<p>Gan Dounan: Promoting trade requires the help of banks to develop. Export trade is determined by foreigners to us. Even if the Chinese don't do it, foreign firms will still do it. If foreigners do it, the foreign exchange will fall into the hands of foreigners. Therefore, export businesses must be done directly by Chinese people and foreigners. Direct dealings require the help of banks to purchase raw materials needed for production. This is obviously different from speculation and hoarding.</p>
<p>Promoting Trade and the National Goods Industry</p>
<p>Chairman: Everyone has discussed the relationship between promoting trade and the financial sector in great detail. Now we have come to the national goods industry. Please discuss the advantages and disadvantages, difficulties, and solutions of our country's international trade from the perspective of national goods manufacturers and vendors of domestic raw materials.</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan: National goods manufacturers use domestic raw materials, so there is no risk of unstable foreign exchange. Is the purpose of the loan to buy raw materials? Therefore, the bank should investigate the purchasing merchant. Or after the manufacturer receives the raw materials, the bank directly pays for the goods. Or the raw material merchant introduces the bank to lend. Suppose there are no domestic raw materials or there are not enough, and you cannot buy them from foreign countries, you can also investigate. If you are afraid of losses due to foreign exchange fluctuations and do not lend, this seems unreasonable.</p>
<p>Yu Zhongkui: The financial sector itself does have its difficulties. Time deposits decrease, and demand deposits increase. Banks must be fully prepared. Therefore, lending is very difficult. The industrial sector has difficulties, and the banks also have difficulties. They have to pay interest on deposits, and they also have to lose interest on the reserve.</p>
<p>Zhang Yifan: If manufacturers import raw materials, they can directly borrow foreign exchange from the bank. In the future, they will also repay in foreign exchange, which is convenient for both parties.</p>
<p>Lu Xilin: All commercial banks are doing this.</p>
<p>Gan Dounan: The financial sector's difficulties are indeed a fact, so we must find ways to solve them. In short, loans to Chinese manufacturers should be done by Huashang Banks. If foreign banks can do it, but we cannot help ourselves, wouldn't that be a joke?</p>
<p>Li Shoulu: The reason why foreign banks can do it, but Chinese banks cannot, is because foreign banks have lower deposit interest rates, or even no interest at all. Huashang Banks generally have very high interest rates, such as 4% weekly interest for demand deposits and 7% for time deposits...</p>
<p>Yu Zhongkui: Depositors can use demand deposits to speculate at any time, but banks cannot use them for lending. Banks themselves also have to do business to survive.</p>
<p>You Boqun: These are all related to the environment, and there is no fundamental solution.</p>
<p>Chairman: All parties have their inherent difficulties. I would like to tell a joke here. On May 2nd, foreign exchange suddenly decreased sharply. Shops rushed to increase prices by several percent immediately. Therefore, everyone expressed dissatisfaction and thought that merchants were deliberately manipulating prices and harming society. However, according to the opinions of the shops, when foreign exchange decreases, the public will rush to buy and hoard goods. If the shops do not raise prices, their inventory will be bought out, and they will have nothing to sell. In this way, customers blame the shops for raising prices, and the shops blame the customers for hoarding goods. It is difficult to tell who is right and who is wrong. However, in fact, everyone is wrong. We are very happy today that everyone can sincerely discuss this in detail. Therefore, we have a better understanding of the difficulties faced by the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors. However, I believe that the development of national goods manufacturers and import and export businesses cannot be achieved without the help of the financial sector. And the financial sector needs the prosperity of industry and commerce to find a proper outlet. Therefore, in the face of difficulties for everyone, we must think of more proactive ways to understand and help each other to achieve mutual benefits.</p>
<p>Yu Zhongkui: It is also the fault of the buyers, and you cannot blame the shops for raising prices. If the shops do not raise prices, their goods will be bought out, and how can they continue to operate? In addition to closing down and having a big sale, the selling price must be slightly higher than the price of goods purchased at the time.</p>
<p>Promoting Trade and Import and Export Businesses</p>
<p>Chairman: Now let's discuss promoting trade and import and export businesses. Please express your opinions from the perspective of import and export merchants, overseas consumers, and overseas import and export companies.</p>
<p>Feng Hengqin: Regarding promoting export exchange, I wrote an article in 1933 advocating that the financial industry should provide special financing to export merchants as much as possible. The methods are as follows: (1) Advances, interest, and [ ], should be [ ] given to the amount of import [ ]. (2) Request foreign branches or agent banks to observe the sales trends of goods for export exchange done by the entrusted bank with an objective eye and prepare detailed reports at any time to be forwarded to export merchants so that they can know what to improve.</p>
<p>Now, not only export exchange should be supported, but also import exchange. In order to promote production, the financial industry should also provide convenience to legitimate national goods manufacturers who purchase raw materials abroad. However, the entire Shanghai market after the war has been shrouded in the power of hoarding and speculation. Although the financial industry has already provided some financing to import and export merchants, in fact, import and export merchants hope that the financial industry will provide much more assistance due to the large volume of trade. How should both parties cooperate? How should we adjust it as much as possible? This is indeed a problem worth discussing at present. Based on my personal feelings, there seem to be the following two methods for research:</p>
<p>(1) The financial industry should consolidate loans for ordinary goods and concentrate on investing in import and export trade. The method is: (1) Loans for various goods with speculative nature should be recalled and not lent to obtain a part of the funds that can be used. At the same time, prices can also fall considerably. (2) For loans for daily necessities, such as rice and coal, public organizations should come forward to raise funds to handle them. Private individuals or ordinary firms should not make pledges to silver firms and money changers to avoid the malpractices of manipulation and hoarding. (3) All financing related to legitimate import and export trade, regardless of exchange pledges or loans, should be undertaken as much as possible to provide convenience.</p>
<p>(2) The financial industry should set up special trust funds to be used for import and export trade. The method is: (1) The financial industry should collect special trust funds in accordance with trust investment methods for use in import and export trade. (2) This trust fund stipulates a certain guaranteed interest rate. A part of the profits from its use is obtained by import and export traders, a small part is obtained by the bank, and the rest is entirely obtained by the trustees. (3) This trust fund can be handled by one bank or jointly by several banks. (4) The method of financial institutions investing in import and export merchants can be negotiated at any time in accordance with the actual situation.</p>
<p>The above is only my personal temporary proposal, which seems like a fantasy. This matter is of great importance, and it seems that the financial industry and import and export merchants should have a corresponding organization to discuss it in the long term. I respectfully ask everyone for your guidance.</p>
<p>Wang Fuli: I would like to add an explanation to the third point: that is, the banking sector is not unwilling to lend to industry and commerce, but it differs depending on the location. The Shanghai area is almost a occupied area. The government is unwilling to lend at will and indirectly help others prosper, but in the interior, not only do they lend as usual, but the lending conditions are more favorable than before the war, and the interest rates are not increased. As far as I know, the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office has allocated 30 million yuan from government banks to support industry and commerce; and the China Industrial Cooperative Society has recently borrowed 20 million yuan; in addition, industrialists and technicians who have practical plans to help increase production in the rear are loaned considerable funds after passing the examination, and even subsidies are added. These facts are obvious to everyone. I respectfully ask all enthusiastic entrepreneurs to bravely advance to the interior and not be confined to a corner of Shanghai!</p>
<p>I feel that the fourth point, while promoting foreign trade is quite important, if domestic goods are not sufficient, we must first start by enriching domestic goods. Just take cotton yarn as an example. There are 160 million spindles in the world, and the world population is 1.6 billion. On average, every ten people should have one spindle. My country has a population of 450 million, and according to this apportionment, there should be 45 million spindles, so that we will not suffer losses in the world. Before the July 7th Incident, my country also only had 2.8 million spindles, which was already far from enough. Now there are less than 700,000 spindles left. How serious is the problem of clothing? At this extraordinary time, traffic is very difficult, and it is by no means easy to import a large number of machines from foreign countries and set up many factories in the rear. We have no choice but to think of other ways to supplement it domestically. Currently, mechanically-assisted hand spinning is popular in the interior, such as 77 spinning, 31 spinning, Indian spinning, and Ye Jing spinning. They are springing up like mushrooms, which is caused by the situation and a good way to remedy it. I have worked with several comrades to conduct research and have recently developed a "super-large drawing small spinning machine" called the "New Farmer Type," which is now being manufactured in large quantities. The results are very good and orders are congested. In the future, there will be considerable subsidies for this industry. The details will be discussed in an article later. This is just an example of the insufficient domestic goods and does not mean that we can ignore [ ] all foreign trade.</p>
<p>Gao Shiheng: I think this issue is related to all parties to some extent. Generally speaking, all parties have difficulties. The government has its difficulties, the financial sector has its difficulties, the manufacturers have their difficulties, and the traders have their difficulties. We need to know that from the government's standpoint, Shanghai is not very important. However, from the perspective of Shanghai's 5 million people, Shanghai is the birthplace of talents and the financial center of the country. Future international trade cannot be separated from Shanghai. It is necessary to properly maintain Shanghai's industry! Being in this contradictory situation, our situation is very difficult. The cost of living is so high, which is not only the pain of some people, but the pain of all Shanghai people. Although [ ] some people become rich by buying and selling US dollars, their hearts are not necessarily happy.</p>
<p>Regarding the bank, we blame it. Why can foreign [ ] banks do things like exchange pledges and discounting? Why are Chinese banks unwilling to help us? But they also have their own difficulties. For example, as Mr. Yu just said, commercial banks cannot lend on a large scale due to the increase in demand deposits and the decrease in time deposits. As for state banks, the government does not want funds to remain in Shanghai. If you go to the interior to operate, you are very welcome! All banks will also give you as much convenience as possible!</p>
<p>Now national goods manufacturers cannot even talk about developing abroad! On this point, Mr. Zhu just said: "Because of foreign sales, prices have increased." But the reason for the surge in Shanghai is not because there is a shortage of goods, but entirely because of people's hearts. It must be known that there are 8 million overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia who welcome national goods, especially because of the foreign exchange relationship. Shanghai's goods are cheaper than those there. Therefore, the national goods trade there is as busy as [ ]. As long as we can endure hardship and be proactive, not only Southeast Asia needs our goods, but other countries also need our goods.</p>
<p>"We" cannot give up Shanghai because Shanghai is our base. But how can we develop foreign trade? The result is still financial cooperation. In countries around the world such as [ ] the United States and Japan, their overseas trade can be charged in large quantities, while the Chinese cannot. Isn't this a big impact? Why can they charge and we cannot? This is because they have the help of national banks and commercial banks, and we don't have it; even if we have it, it is very little. It must be known that the bills we receive are also the income of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Foreign consumers welcome our Chinese goods as long as the quality meets the standards. But how can international trade be developed? All parties are related. The most important thing is that the financial sector and the industrial sector study a variable and beneficial method so that our international trade can flourish!</p>
<p>Wang Fuli: Recently, comrades in the national goods industry have repeatedly studied this issue and intend to achieve the following three things. I would like to reiterate them for your reference. (1) Please ask the government to ban futures trading to avoid speculation. (2) Please ask the government to issue 100 million yuan in exchange to provide working capital for Shanghai's industrial sector. (3) The law will sanction those who engage in futures trading and not be protected by law.</p>
<p>Ke Tianfu: Recently, the sales of national goods overseas have been expanding daily. However, my country's shipping industry is very backward. As for European and American ships, the number of ships coming to China is decreasing day by day due to the impact of the war. I am afraid that in the future, the situation of "there are goods but no ships to transport" may occur. I hope the government will pay due attention. Regarding the level of overseas Chinese investment in the motherland, the government should provide various conveniences and guidance. …</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>Chairman: Today's seminar started at 10:00 AM and it is now 4:00 PM. Thank you to the leaders from all walks of life for taking the time to attend and sharing your insights, sacrificing a long and valuable time. How to promote my country's international trade, in this state of domestic and foreign war, future events will depend on the changes in the future environment. Of course, no one can predetermine an immutable policy. However, in the grand theories expressed by the leaders of all circles today, we have a clear understanding of international trade and banks, foreign exchange, shipping costs, national goods merchants, import and export merchants, overseas markets, and government and people's cooperation. This is the necessary path to promote my country's international trade. Today's records, in addition to being published by the Shen Bao Economic Supplement on June 3rd and 10th, respectively, the Daily Economic Monthly published by our company will also publish a special issue on international trade. Shen Bao Jingzhuan and our company initiated this seminar to promote international trade, with the aim of soliciting opinions from all walks of life. We hope that leaders from all walks of life will work hard at any time to guide our country's international trade onto a smooth path, so that industry and commerce can have proper development, finance can have proper outlets, and the national economy and people's livelihood can benefit from it.

<h3>Financial Pound Sterling Falls Again; Italian Participation in the War Becomes Clear; Indian Silver Trading is Remarkably Strong</h3>
<p>An electric dispatch from New York on the 8th stated that the pound sterling exchange rate fell again due to the increasingly evident signs of Italian participation in the war in recent days, which triggered a small number of sellers. The opening price was 3 yuan 6 jiao 7 fen, but later recovered to 3 yuan 7 jiao 9 fen and a half due to active buying. However, the result was 3 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, a drop of 7 fen compared to the previous day. The French franc exchange market also fell by 3 fen and a half following this.</p>
<p>Also, according to an electric dispatch from Bombay, the silver market situation was stable, but trading was remarkably strong. As a result, spot and June each rose by 3 annas, while July rose by 2 annas. A total of 300 orders were traded. In addition, both the British and American silver markets were closed, and there was no electric dispatch.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar is Tight Again</h3>
<p>According to Dutch telecommunications, the sugar market picked up again yesterday because there were no ships available for loading in June, so people's minds were better. The spot price of No. 24 coarse white sugar was 70 yuan 3 jiao to 71 yuan at the local warehouse, and the price of foreign warehouse goods was 70 yuan to 71 yuan in the morning and still 71 yuan in the afternoon. However, transit goods were cheaper, with a spot price of 56 yuan 7 jiao and 57 yuan for orders on June 15th. Taikoo Crystal White B mark was 83 yuan, up 5 jiao. CW and CX marks are in short supply, and DY and HX marks also have few stocks, so there were no allocations. The H mark, raw sugar, and Dutch raw sugar both remained at the original price. The price of domestic refined sugar was 71 yuan, up 1 yuan. There was no change in domestic ice sugar. It is said that domestic sugar has been active in stomach clearance after the holiday, and there have been wholesale transactions.</p>
<h3>Coal: Smoke and Ash Stomach Clearance is Sluggish</h3>
<p>The demand for various types of smoke coal and ash has been sluggish recently due to the warm weather. In addition, most factories in this port have switched to diesel and white coal to save fuel, resulting in an increasingly sluggish stomach clearance of smoke and ash. According to the dismantling prices of the industry, Kaiping No. 2 ash is 200 yuan per ton, Indian ash is 255 yuan, and Keelung ash is 180 yuan. The above are all prices from the warehouse, and street door shops add a small amount of handling fee.</p>

<p>無錫米稻價格、因來源稀少、囤戶購進步步高漲、白粳已至每石三十七元、粳稻每担十七元六角、更因天氣晴朗、挿秧時節、缺少雨水、查各棧存稻有三十餘萬祖、本可維持接新、事為某商包運出境、縣倉存積有限、今後武宜產區、稻船或不合算販運浙省、仍轉向來錫、來源若湧、米價或可回鬆</p>
<p>Due to scarce supply, rice prices in Wuxi have been rising step by step as hoarders purchase more. White japonica rice has reached thirty-seven yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), and japonica paddy rice is seventeen yuan and six jiao per dan (unit of weight). Furthermore, due to sunny weather during the rice planting season, there is a lack of rainfall. It is found that there are over 300,000 zu (unit of measure) of rice stored in various warehouses, which could originally have been used to supply the new harvest. However, a merchant has chartered to transport the rice out of the country. The county granary has limited stock. In the future, rice boats from the Wuyi production area may find it unprofitable to transport rice to Zhejiang Province and will instead turn to Wuxi. If the supply surges, rice prices may ease.</p>
<p>麵粉 Flour</p>
<p>陳貨有限、新粉出貨又微、致售價不一、零粉每包十四元五角、欲多購雖至十五元，亦難辦到、往年新貨上市、粉麥市必低落、目下市面失常、已入畸形狀態、</p>
<p>The supply of old flour is limited, and the output of new flour is also small, leading to varying selling prices. Retail flour is fourteen yuan and five jiao per bag. Even if willing to pay fifteen yuan for larger quantities, it is difficult to obtain. In previous years, the flour and wheat markets would fall when new products were released. Currently, the market is abnormal and has entered a distorted state.</p>
<p>小麥 Wheat</p>
<p>雖上市半月、而每日市上少至數十包、多至一二百包、民豐慶豐兩廠試過樣粉、造折尙佳、新杜小麥開過每包一百七十四斤價三十三元七角、客麥三十三元四五角、今歲收成雖勝往年、但行客對於門市鄕貨、產地販運河路雜費、限於資力、均審愼着手、錫地大小有十餘家、原料都仰本地收進、陳麥已絕跡、須待各路湧到、方有低落之望、（知）</p>
<p>Although it has been on the market for half a month, the daily supply is only a few dozen bags at a minimum, and one to two hundred bags at most. The Minfeng and Qingfeng factories have tested samples of the flour, and the processed quality is still good. New Du wheat was priced at thirty-three yuan and seven jiao per bag of 174 jin (unit of weight), and passenger wheat at thirty-three yuan, four or five jiao. Although this year's harvest is better than in previous years, merchants are cautious due to limited capital for transporting local goods from production areas to shops and river and road expenses. There are more than a dozen mills of varying sizes in Wuxi, all relying on local sources for raw materials. Old wheat has disappeared. A drop in price can only be expected when the supply from all regions surges. (Reported)</p>
<h3>The Transition of Woolen Cloth Sales</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>After 1925, the woolen cloth sales suddenly shifted. Merchants from Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangdong saw a decline in procurement, mainly because they switched to purchasing from Hong Kong. Many of the demands from the Dalian merchants were re-exported goods because the woolen cloths had already been taxed in Shanghai. By shipping them to Dalian, they could claim the tax paid from the customs office. This was the so-called existing policy of storing goods for export. Now, this practice has been cancelled, thus, the representative offices of Dalian merchants in Shanghai are mostly closed. On the other hand, the purchasing power of Chongqing and Chengdu merchants is now stronger. Merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, Weihai and along the Yangtze River, especially those managed by people from the south, personally visit Shanghai to purchase goods twice a year, purchasing summer goods in the spring and winter goods in the autumn. The largest businesses managed by people from the north are Tianjin's Hua Xing and Dun Qing Long. (Tian Hua Xing's Shanghai office was founded by them.) After the goods are shipped to Tianjin, they are then sold to various smaller merchants.</p>
<p>In 1927, after the Northern Expedition united China and established the capital in Nanjing, woolen cloth sales shifted significantly again. The sales of merchants from Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jinhua, Wenzhou, Ningbo and other inland regions, who had previously purchased small quantities, suddenly became brisk, especially those from Nanjing. At the same time, sales from the Northeast declined sharply. Many foreign firms established branches in Tianjin, so Tianjin merchants mostly placed orders directly, and fewer came to Shanghai to purchase goods. However, the sales of merchants from Changsha, Hankou, and Nanchang all improved. During this period, many South China merchant offices in Shanghai closed down, while the demand from merchants from Guizhou, Yunnan and Sichuan increased.</p>
<p>In 1932, after the January 28th Incident, woolen cloth sales naturally changed drastically again. Although the war ended soon after, northern merchants were hit hard. Merchants from the Northeast left Shanghai and went north. Famous northern merchant stores in Shanghai, such as Yong Feng Li, Yi Shun Heng, and Yi Shun Sheng, were reorganized one after another. The sales from the Northeast merchants suddenly dropped by half, but sales to the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Zhejiang, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Hubei continued to increase. As a result, the average sales of woolen cloth did not decline and were even higher than before.</p>
<p>In 1937, when the Battle of Shanghai broke out on August 13th, the full-scale war of resistance began, progressing intensely. Due to inconvenient transportation, woolen cloth sales inevitably suffered a great blow. The postal services were intermittent. The delivery time was slow due to repeated transfers, so even though the merchants had sold out their stock and were eager to purchase goods from Shanghai, they were forced to do so due to the circumstances. Before Wuhan fell, many merchants resold goods via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. Later, as the situation changed and the guerrilla areas expanded, water and land transportation became even more difficult. The sales of merchants across the country declined sharply. The merchant store Dachuan Tong closed down. Xiang Yu Gong was renamed Xiang Yu Gong. Yi He Yu was renamed Zhi Chang Xiang. Yong Feng Li was reorganized. New stores such as Bei Heng Mao and Yi Xin were established, forming a cycle of metabolism.</p>
<p>During this long war of resistance, woolen cloth sales decreased significantly in all regions. Recently, merchants from Peiping and Tianjin have become slightly more active, followed by merchants from Yunnan and Sichuan, then merchants from South China. Merchants from Wenzhou, Jinhua, and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province are also still active, but their sales have decreased by 60% compared to before the August 13th Incident. Considering the current situation, it is difficult for sales to merchants to improve. However, sales in this city have increased significantly due to the sharp increase in the population of the isolated island, exceeding more than half of the sales before the war. Therefore, the woolen cloth industry is now focusing on transactions in this city and temporarily does not seem to attach importance to business with merchants. (The End)</p>

<h3>A Study on the History of the Annexation of the Gorkhas (2)</h3>
<p>The Gorkhas are short, strong, and fierce, with a population of about one million, and had no contact with China in ancient times. It was only in the ninth year of the Yongzheng reign that they began to offer local products with a gold leaf memorial. In the third month of the fifty-fifth year of the Qianlong reign, instigated by Shemarpa, the brother of the Panchen Lama of Tibet, they coveted the cultivation of Tibet and launched troops to invade the border. The Tangut troops could not resist, and urgently appealed to the central court. However, the imperial guards dispatched to suppress them, Generals Ba Zhong, E Hui, and Cheng De, mediated a bribed peace, secretly allowing the Tibetan Khambo (high ranking religious figures) to privately promise an annual tribute of 150,000 taels of gold. They held back their troops and did not fight, falsely reporting the Gorkhas as surrendered. They then persuaded the Gorkha chiefs to pay tribute and receive official titles. In July, the Gorkhas sent people to Tibet to pay tribute, and sent a letter to the resident minister in Tibet, requesting to continue the previous agreement. E Hui, fearing that the matter would be exposed, suppressed the information. The following year, the annual tribute to Tibet was once again not paid, and the Gorkha chiefs, using the debt as an excuse, once again invaded the Zhaxilhunbu area of Tibet. When the resident minister in Tibet, Bao Tai, heard of the arrival of the invaders, he moved the Panchen Lama to the front of Tibet, exaggerated the strength of the invaders, and requested to move the Dalai Lama to Xining and the Panchen Lama to Taining, intending to abandon the Tibetan territory to the invaders. The Lamas, Ji Zhong and Zhacang, then falsely claimed that the auspicious goddess did not favor battle, and the morale of the people collapsed. The invaders looted Zhaxilhunbu, and all of Tibet was greatly shocked! The two Grand Lamas sent urgent memorials. At this time, E Hui was the Governor-General of Sichuan, and Cheng De was the General of Sichuan, and all the blame was placed on Ba Zhong. The Emperor ordered the two to go to Tibet to suppress the invasion, but they advanced slowly.</p>

<h3>A Chronicle of Mr. Ding's Congee Gathering</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>In the past, there were many scholars who loved congee, such as Lu Cheng's chestnut congee, Lu You's taro congee, Dongpo's light congee, and Xiangshan's congee. There were also those who cooked congee with peach blossoms, simmered it with plum stamens, added shredded cinnamon and ginger, or used glutinous rice and beans. My predecessor, Mr. Ding Zhonghu, had profound knowledge of ancient culture and especially loved the "double-bow rice" (referring to rice grains). He promoted his fondness for it by hosting congee gatherings. Every Monday evening, he would hold one, and never missed a single one for decades. His persistent spirit is truly admirable. Last Monday, I also had the opportunity to participate. Young and old were gathered, men and women sat together. There were painters, calligraphers, poets, lyricists, medical practitioners, and connoisseurs. It can be said that there were many talented people. Guests were required to sign their names in a register, and their addresses and dates of birth were also listed in detail. At the beginning of the register, there were rules which stated: "In this Monday gathering, we do not value empty formalities. We do not greet guests upon arrival, nor do we see them off upon departure. There is no distinction between host and guest. There is no fixed seating arrangement. We value honesty and simplicity. Congee is served instead of rice, and water is served instead of tea. We chat about the past and present, and quietly appreciate calligraphy and paintings. We do not speak of right and wrong, nor do we discuss official matters. We act freely and forget ourselves. Our style is simple and detached. Our friendship is based on righteousness, and that is all. To display rich food and elaborate arrangements, to be insincere inwardly and artificially outward, to be concerned with self-interest, and to look at each other with hostility, is the way of worldly friendships, which we reject." It was modeled after Sima Wengong's sincerity gathering and borrowed some of its wording. The room was decorated with bronze Buddhas and porcelain pots, which were colorful and full of ancient charm. While we were talking and laughing, the servants came to set the table. There were two tables, and everyone sat around them. There were eight dishes, all of which were simple and elegant, making one imagine immortal sesame seeds. Mr. Zhong and I sat at the same table. He said that he had not eaten fish or meat for a long time. If he ate meat at will, his blood vessels would harden and his blood pressure would rise. It was a slow poisoning. Alas, how can the people of the world not abstain from gluttony? It is best to eat vegetables, such as soybeans, tomatoes, and cabbage, which are very nutritious. He eats more than ten oranges and bananas every morning and noon. He would rather eat less congee and rice than give up fruits and gourds. This is the way to health. Also, too much salt can stimulate the kidneys. Eating too much salt can gradually reduce the function of the kidneys. Lack of nutrition can make people thin and weak, but excessive nutrition is also harmful, causing people to age and die early. As the saying goes, too much is as bad as too little. I said that one night's conversation is better than ten years of books. Mr. Zhong smiled. When we left, the shops were all closed and the sounds of the city were gradually quiet.</p>
<h3>Recommendations for Several Summer Fabrics</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Summer fabrics should first focus on being light and airy. However, this naturally allows imported goods to dominate the entire summer fabric market. In fact, domestic silk also has these characteristics. At a time when everything is rising in price, and the price of each foot of silk fabric is more than two or three yuan, I think Sheng Textile is still worth recommending:</p>
<p>電力紡 (Dianlifang/Electric Spun Silk) Dianlifang is the only new product from Sheng Textile in recent years. In the past, its raw materials used factory silk for both warp and weft, so it was tightly woven, thin, clean, smooth, and beautiful, making it the crown of all silks from Sheng Textile. After the war, due to the high price of factory silk, local silk has been used for both warp and weft. The appearance seems to have deteriorated somewhat, but its lightness, airiness, washability, and durability have not diminished. It is most suitable for making long and short shirts and trousers, undershirts, and the like. The width is 22 inches, and the price per foot is at most one yuan and two or three jiao, which is much cheaper than crepe de chine, Indian silk, etc.</p>
<p>光扣紡 (Guangkoufang/Bright Buckled Silk) Secondly, there is Guangkoufang. Dianlifang is woven by electric machines, while Guangkoufang is entirely woven by wooden machines and manual labor. Therefore, there is really no difference in quality and texture between the two. However, the evenness and smoothness of the Guangkoufang silk surface are not as beautiful as that of Dianlifang. The advantage of Sheng Textile is that the texture becomes finer and denser with each wash, and the color becomes more elegant with each wash. Guangkoufang is superior to Dianlifang in this regard. The width is about the same as Dianlifang, and the price per foot is about one yuan. A family of four or five can buy a bolt of Guangkoufang for fifty yuan, which is more than enough for summer clothes. There are also various stripes and checks, with quiet and elegant patterns, which are especially suitable for women.</p>
<p>生紡 (Shengfang/Raw Spun Silk) Wearing silk clothes in the summer seems to feel sticky when sweating. Although boiled silk does not have this problem, its high price is prohibitive. Then Shengfang can at least make up for this deficiency. Shengfang is made of finer warp and weft stripes. Although the texture and weight are not as heavy as the above two, it is not as fine as coarse summer cloth and wanzai cloth without being boiled. The price per foot is only five or six jiao. Although the width is narrower, only one foot and five inches, it is as cool and comfortable as boiled silk when used to make shirts.</p>
<h3>On Mosquito Nets</h3>
<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>As summer arrives, it is the season for mosquitoes to wreak havoc. Especially when sleeping at night, mosquitoes make a buzzing sound in your ear, which not only disturbs your dreams but also sucks your blood and spreads germs. It is truly a hateful little thing and a threat to human health.</p>
<p>To eliminate this threat, the only thing to do is hang a mosquito net over the bed. Put down the mosquito net when sleeping, so that mosquitoes cannot get in. You can sleep soundly inside the net.</p>
<p>The function of mosquito nets differs somewhat between Shanghai and inland areas. In Shanghai, mosquito nets are used purely to keep out mosquitoes, so they are rarely used except in summer and autumn. Because it is thought that they hinder air circulation and are not conducive to hygiene during sleep, most styles are western-style dome mosquito nets. They can be rolled up high during the day when not in use, and lowered over the entire bed before going to sleep at night. However, in most inland areas, people hang them on the bed year-round. That is our country's traditional style; rectangular and suitable for the size of the bed, with two pages in the front, like curtains, for easy entry and exit. In addition to protecting against mosquitoes in the summer, inland areas usually have old-fashioned houses. Some houses do not have ceilings, and the tiles are exposed, with dust flying around. Some walls are thin, and sunlight and rain may invade through the cracks. At night, the entire bed is protected by the mosquito net. Unlike the western-style houses in Shanghai, the walls are so thick that closing the doors and windows can isolate the room from the outside world, so there is no need to hang mosquito nets on the bed.</p>
<p>The materials of mosquito nets are usually made of foreign gauze, summer cloth, bamboo cloth, zhuluo gauze, etc. for Chinese style and mostly use zhuluo gauze for Western style; of course, zhuluo gauze is the most suitable because it is cool, breathable, and hygienic!</p>
<h3>Leather Rafts Navigating the Upper Reaches of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>— Haizhiji</p>
<p>Leather rafts are the most common form of water transportation in the Northwest. Due to geographical reasons, the Northwest is not suitable for farming but is suitable for animal husbandry. They can most easily obtain things from animals. They use cowhide or sheepskin to make navigational tools. The method of making leather rafts is very simple, but the process takes a considerable amount of time. The first step is to soak the cowhide or sheepskin bags in oil for a long time, then tightly tie the heads, tails, and limbs, and inflate them with air. Several, a dozen, or dozens or hundreds of them are woven into a flat, square surface, and wooden frames are placed on top. Passengers or goods can be carried on the wooden frames. The heaviest of these leather rafts can carry more than 10,000 jin (unit of weight).</p>
<p>Each leather raft is operated by sailors. The number of sailors depends on the size of the raft. The sailors are called "bashis" (craftsmen), who are responsible for the oars at the front and rear. One of them is the leader, called "nashishi" (person in charge). The leader must have traveled the rivers for a long time, be proficient in water skills, and be an alert and decisive person. Most of these coolies are Hui people from Hezhou, Gansu. They do not eat opium, are physically strong, have a sense of responsibility, and are able to undertake this arduous task. Among them, there is a type called "xia bashis" (gorge craftsmen), who are even more proficient in water skills and familiar with water patterns. Originally, the Yellow River passes through Gansu Province. Sixty to seventy li (unit of distance) from Lanzhou, there is a "Great Gorge" sixty li long. The river surface is very narrow, and the water is rapid with huge beaches and nearly right-angle turns. As a result, a type of sailor who specializes in navigating the dangerous waters of the "Great Gorge" has emerged, called "xia bashis" (gorge craftsmen).</p>
<p>Leather rafts sailing on the Yellow River rely entirely on water patterns in calm waters. They choose the location of the main stream of the water pattern to navigate the raft on. Because the water of the main pattern is deeper and faster, there is no danger of running aground. Therefore, leather rafts dislike wind and rain the most. When the water patterns are disrupted, the leather raft can only stop moving forward. This backward means of transportation is indeed too weak to resist the oppression of nature.</p>

<h3>A Week's Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>Today is the fifth day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar, the traditional Dragon Boat Festival, which is another day for eating. As the saying goes: "Buy a yellow croaker for the Dragon Boat Festival." So eating yellow croaker on the Dragon Boat Festival is indispensable. Originally, the price of yellow croaker was relatively cheap, but in the past two days, because it was near the festival, the fishmongers hoarded the fish and raised the price. Of course, it will be even more expensive today. But because it is indispensable for the festival, one has to bear the pain and eat it. For families with a large number of people, buying a large yellow croaker and cutting it into two sections, adding some pickled vegetables, one bowl in the morning and one bowl at night, is enough to get by. To be more elaborate, then use sweet and sour and wine lees methods to make it more flavorful. To be even more elaborate, then debone it and make fish soup, add diced ham, diced bamboo shoots, sliced mushrooms, and amaranth. Sprinkle a little pepper when eating, and it will naturally be delicious. If you like soup, a ham and yellow croaker slice soup is so delicious. As for other meat and vegetable dishes, everything is expensive during the festival, but you can't not eat them. If there really is a Zhong Jinshi in this world, I would like to see him eat little devils.</p>

<h3>The Violet Hermitage Is Not a Grass</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>In the autumn of the year of Ji Mao (1939), I participated in the Shanghai Chinese-Western Flower Show with the chrysanthemums and small potted plants I had cultivated and was fortunate enough to win the Grand Prize, the Sir Peter Grantham Silver Cup. I wrote this poem to commemorate the occasion:</p>
<p>Every day, the Green Chapter pays tribute to the Eastern Emperor,</p>
<p>Do not let the wind aunt damage the fragrant flowers,</p>
<p>There is nowhere to find the Peach Garden outside the world,</p>
<p>Ten thousand flowers like the sea, deep in the eyes.</p>
<p>Inches of cinnabar dust stain the clear bones,</p>
<p>Following others, bowing and raising, the meaning is hard to calm,</p>
<p>One flower and one tree under the west window,</p>
<p>Not a beautiful eyebrow is also pleasing.</p>
<p>Rare flowers bloom brilliantly from Suzhou,</p>
<p>The crown of all flowers, the first class,</p>
<p>Let the yellow flowers occupy the chief seat,</p>
<p>The pink and green all lower their heads.</p>
<p>Occupying the head of the Ao Turtle, I smile,</p>
<p>The flowers and plants in Wu Palace, the eyebrows of E'e,</p>
<p>I want him, the overseas bearded guest,</p>
<p>To look at Guo Tuotuo with new eyes.</p>
<p>In the late spring of the year of Geng Chen (1940), I participated in the Chinese-Western Flower Show with aquascapes and flower and tree bonsai and won the Grand Prize again. Four poems:</p>
<p>The rosy clouds are steaming and the flowers are like embroidery,</p>
<p>Everywhere in Jiangcheng, spring is formed by itself,</p>
<p>It is absolutely pitiful to gather,</p>
<p>There is one person missing before the flower. (During the annual meeting in the autumn of last year, Mr. Chen Xuyuan came to appreciate the flowers with Mr. Zhang Yijun and his wife, and they laughed and talked happily. Unexpectedly, half a year later, there was a separation between the underworld. Thinking of it, I was in tears!)</p>
<p>Half a year of hard work is not in vain,</p>
<p>This time, I won the championship again,</p>
<p>But I am sad that the rivers and mountains are broken,</p>
<p>I can't bear to see some mountains in the pot. (There is a potted mountain in the exhibits, with a solitary cliff hanging, with flowing water below, and a boat returning to the shore in the reeds, as if I heard the sound of rowing. The viewers praised it, saying that it was full of poetic and pictorial meaning.)</p>
<p>The road to survival after the tribulation is not exhausted,</p>
<p>Watering the garden, I love the fragrant bushes,</p>
<p>I hope you will not despise the idle flowers and plants,</p>
<p>All nations worship at the foot. (I dare not boast of the small way of cultivating flowers. I only participate in international grand events and achieve success, which seems to be enough to bring glory to the country. This is what I am proud of.)</p>
<p>Small grasses and secluded flowers are charming,</p>
<p>With a calm mind, I forget greed, anger, and ignorance,</p>
<p>If I can see the prosperous world again,</p>
<p>The flower country is willing to be a non-rebellious minister. (The world is chaotic and I don't know where it will go. If I can get to the end of my troubles and see the prosperous world again, then I will spend my old age in my hometown, engaging in the life of an old gardener.)</p>
<h3>Sleep and Bedbugs</h3>
<p>— Rulai</p>
<p>Sleep is as important as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Many human ailments are often caused by lack of sleep. In the summer, considering the situation on the isolated island, most of the houses are small and crowded, and it is as hot as a steamer. Sleep is inevitably greatly hindered, so in the summer, one should give up gambling at night or engage in useless pastimes and go to bed early.</p>
<p>The most affected by sleep is the disturbance of bedbugs. Middle and lower-class families cannot avoid having bedbugs. The harder the working class, the more serious the problem. It is a pity that after working hard all day, are they even deprived of the right to sleep that is endowed by nature at night? Thinking from another perspective, we humans are the kings of animals, especially in this era of science. How can we deal with tiny bedbugs and still be helpless? I am afraid that the general scientific community has ignored this trivial problem too much. Perhaps they live in foreign-style houses and cannot feel this pain, and they are unwilling to put in the effort to study it.</p>
<p>Recently, I have tried a strong and effective medicinal water, which was invented by Dr. Sun Kejin. As long as the medicinal liquid is sprayed into the bed frame, palm mat, or wall crevices, it will immediately annihilate all adult insects and larvae in less than five minutes. Now they are sending many employees to visit families everywhere to conduct on-site experiments. After gaining the trust of users, they then promote their products to them. This method is also very commendable.</p>

<h3>New Conditions for Renting a Garret</h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Yesterday, while waiting for a tram at a certain tram stop, I looked up and saw a newly posted, bright red rental notice on a utility pole. The original text was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>"Now available for rent: one garret, spacious and well-lit. Those wishing to rent are limited to a maximum of two or three people and must provide a guarantor to be considered."</p>
<p>After reading this, I couldn't help but feel a bit doubtful. If those wishing to rent are limited to a maximum of two or three people, I wonder what the minimum number of people is. Is it merely renting the space without allowing anyone to live there? And it also states that a guarantor is required, meaning that those wishing to rent the garret need not only a guarantor but also a deposit, like a tea server in a hotel who must provide both a person and money as collateral, which is quite strict.</p>
<p>Old second landlords typically have two common conditions for their tenants: one is that they don't rent to those with young children, and the other is that they don't rent to those without family. I think these two conditions are already quite "petty," and there are inevitable contradictions. If one has family, how can they be prevented from having children? If they have children, it violates their rules. Does this mean the second landlord will issue an eviction notice as soon as a child is born, or will the second landlord not allow them to raise the child? I think the second landlord must have a good solution.</p>
<p>Now, this rental notice is even more perfectly sound. It states a maximum of two or three people, but two or three is already the maximum, clearly indicating that it's only for one person. This is because one person will certainly not have young children, which aligns perfectly with the condition of not renting to those with young children. As for requiring a guarantor, the deposit amount, although not specified, must be considerable. The intention of requiring a deposit is probably due to the second landlord fearing that the tenant will lack rent money. However, with a guarantor, there's no need to worry about a shortage of rent.</p>
<p>If the guarantor is not there to guarantee the rent, then what is the guarantor guaranteeing? Are they guaranteeing that they won't become robbers? Are they guaranteeing that they won't take a wife or concubine? Are they guaranteeing that they won't have an affair? Assuming they have an affair or take a wife or concubine, they will inevitably have children, causing trouble for the second landlord. Therefore, a guarantor is indispensable. The second landlord's original conditions already seem the most demanding, and now these two additional conditions are added, seemingly making them even more thorough. Indeed, it's not easy being a second landlord. If so, I think a second landlord who is so worried should quickly tear down the rental notice and not be a second landlord. Otherwise, besides these four conditions, other unexpected dangers may arise.</p>
<h3>Houses Without Landlords</h3>
<p>— Merchant</p>
<p>In the past three years, the repeated instances of rent disputes, other than ending up in court, seem to have no other proper solutions to achieve a normal resolution. Although the French Concession authorities recently have regulations prohibiting the collection of sub-rents, they still cannot regulate the height of rents because of various reasons, such as location, the newness or age of the houses, whether water is supplied, and others, making it impossible to price and mark them like goods.</p>
<p>In the past, the extremes of rent disputes were no more than the following two methods: the main landlord dealing with the second landlord was demolishing and rebuilding; the second landlord dealing with the tenant was selling the lease and changing the owner. The former is well known through the lawsuit between the Women's Bank and Qingyu Lane, and the latter is too numerous to list. However, after the lease of a house is sold, the new owner denies the transfer, which is truly an innovation. Yesterday, this newspaper carried an advertisement from lawyer Xuan Zhendong representing all the tenants of No. 9 Yingchunfang, Daxin Street, first telling us such a strange thing, the original text of which is as follows:</p>
<p>"Now, according to the aforementioned parties, they stated that their houses were leased from Hong Defan. Mr. Hong suddenly moved out of No. 9 and sold the lease to Dalu Company, forcibly demanding relocation, cutting off the electricity and water. The parties then sought legal remedies. Since Mr. Hong avoided appearing in court, the lawyer representing Dalu Company also denied the transfer. For several months, the parties have had to deposit the rent in the court and the Four Banks Savings Society. Therefore, we commissioned representatives to urge the person in charge of the house to come and collect it quickly to complete the procedures..."</p>
<p>From the phrases "forcibly demanding relocation, cutting off the electricity and water, the parties then sought legal remedies," it seems that this dispute is quite serious. However, "Mr. Hong avoided appearing in court, and the lawyer of Dalu Company also denied the transfer" makes people feel that this dispute is unfathomable, and it is clear that there must be twists and turns in it. We don't need to waste too much brainpower to speculate for the time being. In these few days, even if Hong does not come forward, the original landlord will definitely come out to reveal this mystery.</p>
<p>However, as a tenant, the author cannot help but have some complaints about this matter! For all disputes, everyone may as well make public announcements, and add the reasons for increasing the rent. The acts of renovating and selling the lease are not allowed! If a house has no owner, it is even more perplexing, as the saying goes, "can't grab the braid." But on the other hand, it is also the easiest to solve. If the tenants don't want to live in the house for free, they should simply donate the monthly rent to a charity and keep the receipt for future reference.</p>

<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Fate of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 1 "A Very Pretty Lady!"</p>
<p>There is a short wall in front of the house, with short iron fences with spikes installed on the wall. The door is made of flowered iron bars, with spikes at the top, all painted light green. As soon as we stepped into this iron bar door, we saw a small flower garden on the left, about eight or nine feet deep and more than fifteen feet wide. Some flowering plants were planted in the garden, among which several light red monthly roses were unusually small and thin. After being seduced by the night rain, they bloomed gracefully, both lovely and pitiful. Several porcelain pots are very delicate, but they are casually placed on the ground, and the surrounding of the porcelain surface has been splashed with mud, which shows that the owner of the house is not very interested in the work of seasonal flowers. On the right side, there is also a small open space, separated by short winter green trees, but most of it has been occupied by the doorman's small guardhouse, plus another palm tree, in fact, there is not much "space" left.</p>
<p>As I followed Hawthorne up the cement path where the morning sun was just beginning to dry, Inspector Ni Jinshou, a tall, slender man in a black silk padded robe, had already come out to greet us from inside.</p>
<p>"Mr. Hawthorne, Mr. Bao, thank you for your trouble. This matter is very strange—seems a bit troublesome."</p>
<p>Hawthorne smiled and replied: "In that case, I can't help but thank you first. You've given me another opportunity to broaden my horizons."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou shook hands with us again, leading us up the three cement steps. Hawthorne's gaze wandered on the ground and around, showing that he was already using his superior observational skills. I saw some mud floating on the cement path, which was obviously washed over from the adjacent flower garden by the rain. (10)</p>
<h3>Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>— Zichang</p>
<p>"Clear payment by the first three festivals, no delays allowed," is the first settlement checkpoint of the year. May in the Gregorian calendar passes by languidly like a disease. In addition to money and accounts, there is also a mental "耿耿此懷" account, how can one avoid being vulgar!</p>
<p>May (lunar calendar), pomegranate flowers shine red, it's the season! The whole world is fighting for new life in red blood. Moreover, the Dragon Boat Festival is also a festival of insect birth and death, relying on our efforts to eliminate them. Although "worms die in soy sauce," it must conform to natural selection; and rectifying the soy sauce jar so that it no longer produces maggots is also a fundamental and urgent construction for all people after eliminating insect pests. In fact, it is more important than clearing accounts. "Things must rot before insects can breed" may be a cliche, but it is also a profound truth.</p>
