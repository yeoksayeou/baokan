<p>據會後發表之公報云、內閣於上午九時在勒白侖總統主席之下召集會議、對於西班牙大使所轉來之德政府牒文會加以考慮、德政府牒文中表示準備於法方全權代表之姓名提出後、將停止敵對行為之條件通知法政府、德政府將發表接待此項全權代表之日期與地點、內閣已任命各全權代表矣云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>紐約　據「紐的時報」馬德里訪員傳來可靠消息、軸心國之媾和條件已於昨夜交與西班牙駐法大使勒克里伽、該大使現仍隨法政府駐於波爾多、聞條件甚為苛刻、該訪員探悉交出法艦隊亦居其一、該訪員又稱、據馬德里消息、法國海軍隊伍昨幾全行駛離法國各港、又據西班牙報紙軟稱、曾見法飛機紛紛飛往非洲方面、蓋欲避免落於德軍之手也（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>慕尼黑　德元首希特勒與義首相墨索里尼昨晚在此間結束歷史上會議、與會者尙有德外長里賓特洛甫國防軍總司令季德爾·義外長齊亞諾·參謀决長魯達·由德外部著名譯員史密特擔任傳舌、會議畢後、發表公吿聲音、「德國元首與義大利首相已同意兩國對法國提出休戰要求之態度」、雙方會議達叫小時之久、昨晚八時十分完畢、會議廳外羣衆等候會議之結束、常嚴索里尼及希特勒離查理斯王府時、羣衆唱歌歡呼、希特勒偕墨索里尼往車站、墨索里尼專車駛出車站後、希特勒亦離慕尼黑他往、二人目的地均才宣佈、（十九日合衆電）</p>

<p>柏林　德國全國人民咸集中注莫於慕尼黑會議、政界人士之意見、可以「强便報」為代表、其文略謂、元首希特勒與義相墨索里尼同為維持和平而奮鬭此為德義兩國人民所同有之信仰、目前德義兩國元首當為歐洲和平奠定永久之基礎、法國今欲避免犧牲更多生命多流血當與貧血之飯不相、但目前須流更多之血、必須廓淸財閥政府在歐洲所造成之各項糾紛、故德國所最關懷者乃歐洲之永久和平、吾人均未忘却一九一八年十一月所得之經騐、及凡腳賽和的所加於吾人之束縛、至言此次停戰條件、法國應接受吾人所提出之條件云、（十九日海通電）</p>
<p>條件為商妥前德國不願罷兵</p>
<p>波爾多　法國半官通訊社指稱、今日德國所發表之公報、未載有法傯休戰條的、又謂、必送此項條件商妥後、敵對行為始能終止、此項條件今將還於法國全權代表之前、或須經敦日始能商妥、而實行停戰也、現恐在「停火」實行之前、尙有法國土地更大之部分將為德軍所佔、德軍現向東南竭力推進、此足徵德軍圖在雙方實行休戰以前、與義軍相接觸、又聞法國經西班牙大使送交義政府之公文、尙未另接覆文、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>在英法軍將領主張抗戰到底</p>

<p>法戰協定未簽訂前　法軍奉命賡續抗戰</p>
<p>波爾多　具當總理與國防總長魏剛將軍頃聯銜發表公報稱、一政府茲接獲報吿、德軍現正冒用白旗、希圖不戰而獲得車大進展、爰特鄭重通吿於我國與協商各國陸海空軍曰、停戰協定旣未成立、敵對行動亦求終止、吾人雖擬進行和平談判、但實際上尙求開始是以吾人之職貨、仍在賡續抗戰」云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>期待的課題</h3>
<p>每一分鐘，每一分鐘，期待着較好或更壞的消息；庶幾今後世變歧途將如何抉擇而演進，得覘端倪；庶幾最近數十小時由多方父織的煩悶，得謀應付。可是至今還在期待之中。慕尼黑電訊，僅稱德元首與義首相已商定兩國政府對法國停戰要求的態度，絕未稱述態度的內容。如此簡而不明，當然不夠滿足世人的期待。</p>
<p>歷史上絕無類此的一頁，謂人類感受煩悶的深刻與普遍，得與目前相比擬。天昏地黑，影憧憧，聲啾啾、與整個人類痛癢切膚的下一慕，將揭未揭，却又任何人莫得而逆知下一慕究竟是何景象。隱的可聞的：其一，法國當局說明所蘄求的，並非屈辱的投降，而是光榮的息戰；但怎算得不失其為光榮，當然暫時莫能代為註釋。此外，法國戈爾將軍在英國倫敦，號召法國軍民，趨與歸附；在這號召之下，當然誰都往意於行止尙保留着最大自由的海空將士。其二，英國當局宣明繼續作戰，一切甚積極：尤見其積極的，英屬加拿大首相報吿加國遠征軍在丹麥屬冰島國登陸設防，且經略西半球的法國屬地。但從各種意義上，診斷英國態度，必待德法兩國停戰協定確立了之後，纔算準確。其三，德國朝野對此變局，避不透露何種意見，故莫測高深；但「强硬報」論謂德義兩國領袖的共同抱負，人民的共同信仰，乃在同為維持和平而奮鬭，同為歐洲和平奠定永久的基礎云；如此云云，德國國營的海通社指此為可以代表德國政界人士的意見。其四，淸算，報復，嚴厲，此類呼聲，盛傳於德京柏林，義京羅馬；似羅馬方面尤高昂。其五，美國海軍作戰部長史達克上將突向國會建議，加造軍艦二百艘，需費美金四十萬萬圓；造成之後，數量較英日兩海軍國的總和為大。其六，香港與法屬海防間的海運，宣告停止：據私人推測，尙非中國南海已經起了什麼歐戰的餘波，殆因英國的東方艦隊致力於强化香港與新加坡兩地的防務，不遑冉事護航，以免分散力量。</p>
<p>從這些隱的可聞的極種，雖日絕非空中樓閣可比，絕非捕風捉影之談，然而祇根據了這些，絕對不夠窺測世變前途究將如何趨歸。世變泯泯棼棼，前途渺渺茫茫；除了大膽而不負責任的預言家，目前眞是無從說起。即以目前而論，提示端倪的，第一還須靜觀希特勒與墨索里尼兩位先生，對於法國，或詞時分別對於英法兩國，發付是何課題。我們倘若見了課題之後，或得從旁覘知一二動嚮。第二必須諦視法國或英法兩國，繳卷是何內容。見了內容之後，或得從旁推測幾分成敗。未見課題，祇配煩悶！煩悶之中，却又不免玄想：即德國政界人士心目中的奠定歐洲和平永久基礎，是否必如近數年米英法宣傳家政論家對於納粹經典與法西經典所加的註釋？是否此類註釋竟是完全惡怠的曲解？會不會德國政界人士心目中。和平永久基礎的眞諦，確是卓犖絕倫，超越凡爾賽和的的理論，竟然無殊於中國儒家的王道？會不會德義對英法提示的條件，竟然放棄了淸算的態度，擯除了報復的意念，不取嚴厲而尙寬恕；竟然使央法兩國廉介的人們破涕而笑？使世界輿情翕然？安得這不盡是玄想？但和牛永久的基礎旣為德義兩國朝野所蘄求，則人類應有建樹正常而共通的理論的餘地，人類應不絕望與光明。若以勝敗為一切的標準，若以競造軍艦為不得已的辦法，則必為常識所否認其為和平永久基礎的基礎。不能奠定和平永久基礎，則縱使以戰勝結束了這一塲戰爭，亦祗是準備下决戰爭的開始而已。</p>

<p>重慶　蔣委員長十七日在中央紀念週演辭、其大意業誌前電、茲全文已整理清楚、特為發表如下、甲提要、（一）說明歐戰演進皆於我抗戰有利（而）由最近鄂北鄂西戰況、說明日軍戰略戰術之拙劣、終必為我磁鐵戰術所消滅、（三）報吿我國空軍神勇的奇續、粉碎日人猛炸重慶的迷夢、並勗勉大家、要效法空軍戰士、以少勝多的精神、（四）空襲是磨鍊我們革命精神、與實現我們三民中義唯一之良機、各級主管要以身作則奮發努力、提高工作效能、增加抗戰力量（五）各干管機關對於本委員長各種手令、要切實奉行、以减少空襲損失、减少民衆痛苦、（六）在日機在炸上測騐我國有吾否下一致同仇敵人的氣節、測騐我國民族有吾獨立復興的精神、（七）中國抗戰對世界之偉大貢獻、與最後勝利已在目前、希望大家積極自强、龜勉奮發、來完成我們時代的使命、</p>
<p>乙演詞、主席、各位同志、今天趁總理紀念鉀的機會、要將最近幾週來國際大勢、與中日戰局、對各位報吿一下、在國祭方面、上一週巴黎巳被德軍佔領了、自從去年九月歐戰開始、以迄上週法軍退出巴黎、可以說是歐戰發展如何、現在雖不能斷定但有一點可以斷言的、就是無論歐戰的變化如何、對於我們中國抗戰無時無刻不朝着</p>
<p>有利方面演進、尤其是最近幾週、因為歐戰的緊張、使美國擴軍案在他國會間得以通過、同時禁運問題亦巳開始進行、這兩件事無論直接間接、對於我們中國的抗戰、都有較大的影響、道個道理、我在去年五中全會時、曾經詳細說過了、至今回想、我們這過去的艱苦奮鬥、不到一年半的時間、道個理想竟能完全實現、由此更可自信、我們抗戰的目的、只要能依照我們始終一貫的抗戰政略、和戰略、一步一步的前進、必可以得到</p>
<p>最後勝利所以美國的擴車以及禁運各案的通過、以後可以說巳經決定了亞東的前途、亦已决定了我們抗戰最後的勝利、這是說明隊戰對於中國抗戰的關係、至於歐戰將來發展如何、現在還不敢斷言、但歐洲戰局無論如何演變、對於我國抗戰只有益處、而無害處、遭是可以斷言的、其次要講到最近數週來日我作戰的情形、從上月一日起、至本月十五日止、日人惟一目的即在倣效德國閃電戰的方式、欲以極迅速的手段、來解決中日戰爭、當時我們看到日本的報紙、幾乎全國一致要求迅速設法結束</p>
<p>中日戰爭以期解放他桎梏的痛苦、而我國一般人士不免以為日人可許要從政治上、或經濟上、來求得解決、但本人早就肯定，現在日人除了再在軍事上想孤注一擲的、作最後冒險一逞而外、不能再作其他的概念、所以這兩月以來、日人極力設法在軍事上來進攻、要用軍事勝利來結束中日戰事、尤其是德國用閃電戰術進攻荷比以來、日人心理格外受了蠢動、以為德國可以用閃電戰在荷比完全取勝、他們亦何小可用閃電戰來求得在華的勝利、所以他亦</p>
<p>抄襲德國攻擊荷比的故智、要來擊敗我們中國的軍隊、因之從日人此次攻勢發動以來本人早看到日人一定會抽調其他各戰地的軍隊、使用其全部的力量、來求一逞的、果然、上月一日以來、日人集中大量空軍和坦克車、在襄花路方面其企圖就在要先擊敗我們鄂北方面也戰車、以為我們的野戰兵力一旦為其消滅、第五戰區的戰事可先解決了、我們發現了日人這個陰謀、所以就將那方面野戰部隊、</p>
<p>自動移動到其他方面、當時日軍進到隨棗一帶、不能發現我們野戰主力軍所在、直至進到唐河與新野附近、依舊一無所獲、而我們的野戰部隊即於此時忽在日軍的側背突進、一面截斷了日軍惟一的後方交通綫裏花公路、一面向日軍</p>
<p>猛烈側擊使他不得不倉皇南退、同時我們襄河東主張自忠總司令的部隊、正在日軍南面佈置陣地、準備迎頭痛擊、日人在此種形勢之下、不能小作因獸之鬥、於是集中其飛機戰車、向南猛衝、張總可令所部以衆寡懸殊、自然要受到相當挫失、日人一方面窺知我們張總同令所部受了挫折、一方對於鄂北出擊、反撲了一個空、我們統帥部早就預料他必要乘我們襄西的兵力减少、而來投機冒險了、我們呢、為富時江防與河防一部隊兵力已增加、所以其餘部隊目不宜在岸上死守、因此我們就將江防與提鄂河防主力部隊、先撤到宜昌的北方山地、</p>
<p>待機出擊後來日軍果然不出我們所料、於本月一日起、至前天為止、來進攻宜昌、我們在宜昌部隊只有一小部隊、誘他進入宜昌、而我們主力當時就自動撤到宜昌附近四周山地上、現在我們宜昌街市雖己放棄、而宜昌實在情形是如何呢、今天我可以吿訴各位一下、現在我們軍隊仍在宜昌四周圍、近則五百公尺、遠則三四公里的地方、所以我們軍隊仍舊守在宜昌近郊陣地，實在說、宜昌仍就是由我們的部隊所控制、而且我軍主力正在日軍周圍積極的採取包圍的熊勢、我相信這一回一定可以將日軍在襄西的部隊</p>
<p>整個殲滅日人陷此滬境還不自知、反而盡量誇大宣傳、自謂使用閃電戰術成功、自種其軍隊比德軍還强、進展比德軍還快、一若世界各國無可與之為敵、殊不知其戰略戰術之拙劣、眞是不値識者一笑、大家都知道所謂閃電戰、不僅要有各式多備的戰車和精銳的空軍、更要有各種科學化的組織和技術、而且還需要作戰地帶有很好的交通道路、天時地利人和三者、互相配合、然後纔能收到戰果、但是現在的日人、那裏有這種作戰的條件、他自以德國自比、更是（東施效顰）之所為、以日本的工業與武器裝備、而欲比美於德國、並月要倣效德國閃電戰術猛進深入的行動、以求結束侵略中國的戰爭、安得不困憑藉進而斃呢、何況我們鄂西的地形與交通、這宗戰場又怎樣能事實閃電戰呢、所以日人所謂閃電戰、眞是無異痴人說夢、不過從另一方面講、我們對於日人此種愚笨的進政、却有一個極有效的戰術來吸引他、困陷他、無論他怎樣的行動、我們都可以制他的死命、而尤其要他深入突進、以合我們職術的條件這倘戰術到現在我可以明白公開的吿訴各位、我們對日作戰惟一的戰法</p>
<p>是磁鐵戰就是一如磁石之吸引鐵類、就是使他愈引愈近、愈吸愈緊、欲退不得、欲進不能、始終不能脫離了我們的掌握之中、最後陷他在進退維谷的絕境、所以日軍現在不僅不能施用閃電戰、即退一步言、就是日人果能作戰條件具備實行他閃電戰、亦終必為我們的（磁鐵戰）所克服、我們現在不患宜昌不能克復、而患日軍不肯在襄西戀戰、吾則我們（磁鐵戰）的殲滅戰略、必能於最短期間完全可以實現、總之以我們眞的、磁鐵戰衛來對付日人閃電戰術、以我們軍民一致寗為玉碎、母為瓦全的民族精神、來對日軍窮竭無聊、盲目冥行的轟炸政策、我們不僅要日軍所使用的一切力量、成為支柱鼓瑟、而且要令他處處碰壁、時時撲空、無異於舉挺擊空、我們預定的政略戰略、是沒有不獲得最後成功的、以上是說明兩月來日我作戰情形以及我們採用磁鐵戰術、打擊日軍、令其無所逃於我們的掌握、（待續）（十九日電）</p>

<p>東京　日外務省發言人今日招待新聞記者時、或以讀賣新聞昨載日政府決請德、義兩國對日本在東亞、尤其為關於法屬越南之地位、予以十分尊重一訊相叩者、發言人答稱、渠對此說木便發衣任何言論、又稱、日政府因戰略上原因、刻正嚴重注意越南問題、中·日戰事現巳臻最後或最重要之階段、而越南己成重慶政府輸入軍器接濟之唯一重要路綫、故日本現正集中力量、消除此路綫、日本在東亞乃處於安定局勢的强國之地位、早在英·日初决同盟之外交公文中明白言及云、或舉合衆社羅馬電傳、希特勒及墨索里尼或將要求法國割越南予日本說相叩、發言人答稱、渠對此僅以報紙消息視之、至於報載英·法·美有談判聯合管理越南可能一說、渠並未接正式消息、故以為此種事件、不致發生云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日政府今日又向法國抗議越南轉運軍火與重慶、日外决谷正之、頃召法駐日大使亞爾納亨利至日外部、以抗議書遞交法大使、聞法大使已答覆、谷正之、謂法國正自動對越南採取相當辦法、以阻止軍火經由越南至重慶、（十九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　此間與軍界有密切關係之報紙讀賣新聞、日本向法國抗寧印度支那援助重慶之際、著文警吿印度支那謂、若日本之抗議、未能有具體結果、則日本軍隊、將被迫而採取軍事手段、以阻止此種援助、該報聲稱、今日之抗議、巳為一最後之警吿、如印度支那於接得此抗議後、仍小能阻止以軍火供給重慶政府、日本軍隊當然應採取必須手段、以使此項軍火運輸完全斷絕（十九日合眾社電）</p>
<p>東京　日外務省發言人須磨稱、因法軍之投降德國、日本為遠東之安全、對於印度支那、不得不予以關懷、不特該處所產之錫、米、煤為日本所仰賴、且日政府近對該處轉運軍火至中國內地、正非常注意、而思有以阻止之、須磨對日本報界所傳日本政府計議向德義政府闡明日本之地位、闡明日本為一負有安定遠東責任之國家一節、拒不加以評論、據日本報紙所載、日政府將照會德·義兩國、日本欲從事維持印度支那之現狀、對於印度支那及荷屬米印度政治現狀之任何改變、均不能忽視、（十九日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>英國準備長期戰爭　最後勝利具有信心　邱吉爾在下院報吿戰局　英海空軍力佔絕對優勢</h3>
<p>倫敦　首相邱吉爾昨在下院陳述前數日驚人事跡之祥細經過時、曾於歡呼聲中宣稱、英國及英帝國將繼續作戰、如有必要、即歷時數載並單獨應付亦在所不辭、邱氏宣布英帝國繼續奮鬥之決心、并謂各自治領均準備參加戰事、以至最後之勝利、邱氏於祥述英軍約三十五萬人、即派至法境英軍總數之八分之七、已攜帶大批配備安然撤退後、復祥述政府準備對付德國可能侵略之努力、謂目下全國除地方志願保衛團五十萬人外、有執戈之戰士共計一百二十五萬、惟此項武力將日趨增強、此外更有自治領之軍隊亦參加保護祖國之工作、</p>
<p>邱氏繼說明德國侵略軍所將遭遇之困難、蓋英國堅強之內國防務、來犯者必須為人數極眾之大軍、并須有強有力之海軍艦船為之保護也、至此邱氏又提醒一般聽眾曰、（總之、吾人尙有海軍在、海軍之職責、即在任何大規模海上之遠征隊伍到達海岸之前、或正在開抵之際予以殲滅也、全國之四周已佈置廣大之水雷區域、海軍部已着手進行以應付德人或將發明之新武器、邱氏談及空中力量時、謂英空軍雖在數量上不及德國、但確為一種強有力之工具、其機員及飛機已在多次戰役中、證明其品質上之超越矣、德軍雖在荷比及法國節節勝利、而政府所有之專門顧問人員、均同意英國應繼續抗戰、并有最後勝利之良好及合理的希望、</p>
<p>勗勉團結應付時艱</p>
<p>邱氏又反對抨擊以前之英國各政府云、今有許多人士願追究近數年來政府與國會行為之所以導成此次浩劫者、彼等企圖懲治負責指導吾人事務者、（眾呼靜聽靜聽）、此亦為愚蠢而有害之行為、要知其中負責者固為數甚多不勝窮究也、人人應各激發其天良、并自省其言論、一如余之自省然、余敢斷言、吾人如開啟過去者與現在者之爭鬥、則吾人必將喪失前途也、（眾呼靜聽靜聽）故余不能承認對現政府各人員作任何區別、須知現政府係在危急時代所成立、目的為聯合各黨及各方面之意見、已獲兩院幾一致之贊助、其人員擬站在同一立場并聽命於下院、彼等將統治全國并從事作戰、（歡呼聲作）但在今日之時代、有一絕對必要之事、即對於日日企圖盡責之各員、必應加以尊重、彼等之屬員亦須知其領袖非受威骨之人、即今日在此而明日去職之人、彼等有所指導、必須嚴格忠實遵守之、蓋不如此、吾人將不能應付當前之時艱也、余認為本院今日午後如在公開會議之情形下、延長此項辯論、將非甚有益之事、吾人擬於星期四日召集秘密會議、余認為此乃良好之機會、俾許多人得懇切發表意見、并使下院得討論重大事件、而不致令吾人之危險敵人次晨得閱讀一切、</p>
<p>單獨應戰在所不辭</p>
<p>余對於過去兩周中法國所發生之種種事實、并不認為驚異、實則余在兩週之前、曾儘力明白表示最惡劣之可能性已經開放、余在當時更已表明法國不論發生任何事變、對於英國及英帝國繼續作戰之決心并無影響、倘有必要、即使接連數年及單獨應付、均在所不惜、（眾歡呼）</p>
<p>過去數日中吾人曾將在法境各交通綫數萬軍隊之大部份順利撤退、戰事開始以來調往法國之軍隊、已有八分之七（即四十萬人中之三十五萬人）全數平安返國、（眾歡呼）其餘現正與法軍共同作戰、曾在局部之接觸中、獲得甚大之勝利、吾人又運回九個月來輸至法國之大量軍需·來復槍及各式軍火、故吾人今日在本島之上已擁有甚大及強有力之武力、包括吾方久經訓練之最佳部隊在內、中有數十萬已曾對德一較身手、并自覺毫無遜於德軍之處、（眾歡呼）今日本島共有執戈戰士一百二十五萬人以上、此外尙有五十萬志願保衛團、其中祇有一部份尚未持有來復槍及其他武器、吾人已使每一有槍之人加入防軍、希望吾人武器在最近之將來能有甚大之增加、吾人更擬立即召集并訓練大批之戰士、其餘未奉召入伍者、或從事於各種製造軍火之偉大事業者則在尚未需要之時、可仍保留其原來之工作以服務於國家、</p>
<p>人力資源用之不竭</p>
<p>吾人更有各自治領之軍隊在此、（眾呼靜聽靜聽）加拿大軍隊確曾在法國登陸、惟現已平安撤退、雖皆表示失望、而秩序甚佳、所攜砲隊并無損失、此項自治領軍隊現亦將參加祖國之防衛矣、</p>
<p>余恐以上關於此項甚大武力之陳述、或將引起一項問題、即此項大軍曷為不參加法國之大戰是也、余對此必須聲明者、即除在國內訓練組織之各師團外、祇有十二師之配備、已臻可至海外作戰之程度、此項軍隊之數額、已達法國所望在戰爭第九個月能在法境調用之足數、內國吾人之武力當然將每週逐步增加、侵略大不列顛之舉、將需大規模之運輸、而將敵軍運輸過海、運到之後、尙需予以維持、不斷餽送大戰所需之軍火、蓋大軍旣抵英倫、自將不斷發生大戰也、</p>
<p>越海侵略不難應付</p>
<p>吾人至此應提及海軍、總之、吾人尚有一海軍在、（眾歡呼）若干人民似已淡忘之矣、吾人必須有提醒之、因三十餘年來對於海外侵入可能性之討論、始終參加其間在上次大戰之初、余曾代表海部、負越海運輸所在正規軍出國之責任、惟其時吾國之國防軍甫行召集、未經訓練、故本島在數月之內、實際上毫無可戰之軍隊、當時德國雖擁有偉大戰鬥艦隊、與英為十與十六之比、及隨時能發動戰爭、而海軍則自信有防阻集團進攻之能力、今則德國海軍祇有二三重艦、值得一提矣、吾人又得消息、義大利海軍亦欲前來此諸海、奪取海上優勢、倘義國果真有此意、余祇能宣布吾人將樂予墨索里尼以通過直布羅陀海峽之便利、俾墨氏或可參加其所願望之工作、英艦隊現有一種真正之好奇心理、欲一覘義海軍是否仍達到上次大戰時之水準、抑或已完全失去其原來之力量、（笑聲大作）故依余之見、就大規模之越海侵略而言、吾人今日應付之能力、已遠勝上次大戰時許多時期、及此次戰事之最初數月、當時吾人之其他軍隊尚未訓練、而英國遠征軍已調往海外、并仍在海外未回也、</p>
<p>英海軍從未自命能防止五千或一萬人之襲擊、在黑夜或霧晨之時、突然超過海面、而在海濱之數處登陸、海上勢力之發揮其功效、尤其在現代情況之下、全視侵犯武力之是否為大規模、鑒於吾方之軍事力量、入侵者必須為大規模、始克有用、因其為大規模之故、英海軍方可尋得對手加以攻擊、吾人須知如有軍隊五師、不論其配備如何輕量、亦將需要二百至二百五十艘船艦、加以現代空中偵察及攝影之進步、欲組織如此大規模軍運、集合之而使之超過海洋如無任何強大海軍為之保護、則殊非易事、此項軍運在遠未抵岸之前、將有被截阻之極大可能、兵士在企圖登陸之時、亦將有溺斃或被轟成齏粉之危險、</p>
<p>敵縱狡黠無所施技</p>
<p>吾人更有偉大之水雷區域制度、最近曾大加增強、其中可通行之路綫、唯吾人知之、倘使敵人企圖在此項水雷區域中肅清通行途徑、則英海軍對於敵方掃雷艇及用以保護之任何其他武力、自將加以毀滅、以吾人在海上所佔之絕大優勢、實行此項工作將不感困難、</p>
<p>以上種種、為吾人在最近各次戰事之許多年中、所信賴之正常論據、而經善加試驗善加證明者、惟有一問題存焉、即此種堅實之保證、是否能以任何新法予以巧妙之消毀是、此或似難遇之事、然海軍部對此仍予以若干注意焉（笑聲大作）海軍部主要職責、乃在將任何越海大遠征軍於其抵達本島海岸之前或抵達之際予以毀滅、此事若予祥述、恐無益而有害、蓋將使他人得諗所從來想及之觀念、而他人未必願稍說明其所抱之真正觀念以為交換也、凡余所願言者、厥為始終不倦之慎防、敵人對此問題、必殫精竭慮以鑽研之、蓋敵人旣狡黠、而又富於新奇之奸謀與策書也、吾人旣正以巨數飽經訓練完全適合現代之勝任人員、窮其智能與推想、以研究對付新奇可能性之方術、此種可能性、提出者共有多種、其中若干愚妄可笑、亦有若干非全荒唐無理、下院對於吾人之未雨綢繆或可放心也、</p>
<p>挪戰失利說明原因</p>
<p>若干人民將發生疑問何以英海軍不能阻止德國以大軍越過斯加基拉克而至挪威之行動、須知海峽及北海之狀況與斯加基拉克迥異、因距離之關係、吾人對海面上之艦船不能予以空中之支持、結果因接近敵軍在該方面主力空軍之故、吾人迫不得已祇能利用吾人之潛艇、吾人對於海面上軍艦所能施行之決定封鎖或截斷、均不能付諸實行、吾人之潛艇雖擊沉敵艦甚多、但其本身不能阻止挪威之被侵入、邱氏繼又述及空中侵略及英德空軍未來奮鬥之重大問題、謂英空軍茍不被敵方切實制服、大規模空中侵入似難實現此乃實情、無待贅述、</p>

<h3>夫婦知識　做丈夫者你自己明白嗎　你的妻子為何要恨著你？</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾　合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國偽託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>女性是偉大的。男子整個的人生，簡直脫離不了女性。誰都在母愛的懷抱中長大出來，至成年，父母就要為他討親，他自己也要求愛。結婚以後，他又回到甜蜜而溫存的妻愛的懷抱中了。要是一個年輕的丈夫，得不到他妻子的愛戀，他的悲慘恐怕比乳兒得不到母愛的懷抱，還要加倍！</p>
<p>年輕的丈夫為什么不能得你妻子的愛戀，其原因你自己明白嗎？我願你不要做着人生的獃子。夫婦間失歡的原因，無論說得怎樣冠冕堂皇，但夫婦是性關係的結合，性生活美滿與否是你倆愛情的關鍵所在。假使你有着健壯的體格，豐沛的精力，當你的妻子懷春含情之際，在夫婦間必然有的性生活，使她妙悟頓開，感到丈夫的可貴，人生的樂趣，於是她沒有不死心塌地的屬於你，這時，不特你感到勝利和幸福，同時你倆的愛情是種下多麼根深蒂固的基礎呢！愛情牢固，生活豐富，足以鼓起你向人生大道前進的勇氣，助成你興家立業的成功！可是男子若曾犯自瀆遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾把生命源泉的生殖腺內分泌液弄得虧損了，則凡早洩陽痿，發育不全，精力渙散，未老先衰等症象卽不一而足。此種病夫，雖有嬌妻美妾，在夫婦生活上如何能與妻子協調，於是常把好事變為恨事，這是多麼的沒趣呢？同時妻子亦怎能長此蹉跎青春，犧牲幸福，因憂鬱於心積成疾病者有之；因性的趨迫與人私通私奔者有之，或竟惱羞成怒，借題發揮，與夫大興離婚之訟者在今日社會中亦是多不勝計！</p>
<p>由上以觀，夫婦愛情以丈夫的精力為原動力這是無可否認的了。所以聰明的丈夫，必隨時謀增強其精力，萬一身體偶感虧弱，或有上述症象，則卽購服最對症而特效的生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補其腦腎精血及神經，因此劑久經中外名醫化驗證明，其功效可使男子於服後一日夜間卽生精補腎，助長發育，連服一月，必能根治各症，使精力倍增強壯。中老年人常服，更延年益壽，返老還童。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，制止遺洩，則必收效尤速。此項良藥，余在美國時卽有多數名醫試驗采用，均獲驚人之效果。余歸國後介紹於國人，經治愈之患者，亦不下十萬人云。所以早已風行全球，卽本埠中西五洲等大藥房亦均有出售云。</p>
<h3>健美　乳峯萎癟的特效療法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>從前文人形容女性的走路曰「花枝招展」，其實，花枝招展形容古美人是不恰當的，因為從前舊式婦女，窄窄的三寸金蓮，走起路來，說得難聽點，真像行尸走肉。她們根本不像在走路，簡直是移步，怎會有「花枝招展」　　乳峯萎癟？惟有現在的時代女兒，她們因為知道健美的可愛，關於全身的各部，都不願有絲毫摧殘，讓它充分發育，迨至長大成人（卽發育完全）。便乳高，人高，臀高，這三大地位一高，再加上窄窄腰身，其曲線必然優美，倘為着了高跟鞋的話，那走起路來，真似「花枝招展」了。</p>
<p>不錯，乳高，臀高的女性，不要說我們當面看到會覺得無限心醉！就是閉目偶一思素，覺得這樣的女性，也正有許多的甜蜜回味，因此健美女郎，在物質文明的大都市里，她們真佔盡了種種便宜，怎不要使一般落伍的女性，由艷羨而生妒恨呢！然而我要忠吿一般落伍女性，自己不爭氣而惱恨他人是沒用的。因為妳們的落伍，不過在健美方面有點缺點—乳峯萎癟，臀部瘦削，肌肉羸瘦—而已。倘能及時進服世界婦科名藥女用「生殖素」，則不出兩月以後，照樣面色紅潤，肌肉豐腴，臀部肥圓，而乳峯更似打了氣似的聳了起來，古人說：「士別三日，當刮目相看」，此時妳不也一樣可以與人在交際場中一爭短長嗎？總之，科學的確是偉大的，一向人們認為抱憾無窮的缺陷，到現在是很滿意的解決了。但有一點不得不請女界同胞注意，就是市上類似的藥很多，購時必須堅決指明女用「生殖素」，方不致誤購他藥，致妨碍健康為要！</p>
<h3>遺精症切不可忽視</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>七年之病，求三年之艾，這豈不是很容易的事嗎？然而竟至忽略了！所以我們應不怕疾病，而只怕對於疾病之忽視。尤其像遺精這一類的毛病，平日無痛無癢，最易使人忽視，焉知無痛無癢的病常是最厲害的毛病！</p>
<p>我人體內的精液，係最可寶貴的生殖腺內分泌，包括着腦下垂體，腎臟腺，睪丸腺等多種貴重的內分泌。日常藉血液循環而灌溉全身，功能助長發育，促進代謝，滋養腦·性·脊髓等神經，若患遺精而因循失治，則此種內分泌即日漸枯竭，於是腦衰，健忘，失眠，心悸，腰酸，背痛，腎虧，早洗，陽痿，發育不全，未老先衰等症象卽不一而足。試問此種男子尙還有雄赳赳的氣概嗎？不特在學術與事業的前途，將感缺乏精力，難以勝任之苦！卽在夫婦之間，亦必愧對其妻，為其妻憎恨，演出私奔離婚等種種的家庭悲劇！</p>
<p>然遺精并非為不治之症，況在今日已有特效藥的發明。此卽德國希米脫博士所秘製之「希米脫氏固精片」是也，患者服此特效藥，則於服後當夜卽可收鞏固精關，安神止遺之功。雖重症遺精連服數日亦可痊愈。惟因遺精已有上述症象者須兼服生殖素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，精血及神經，連服一月，必可根治各症，恢復美滿健康。患者若在本埠能親來本診所診治，更可保證治愈。</p>
<h3>鐵一般的事實</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾録</p>
<p>（一）遺精青年莫自暴自棄</p>
<p>陳福清君，年廿二歲，平湖人，自幼聰穎，又好學不倦，故家境雖不甚富裕，仍能在本埠某大學享受大學教育之權利，因其叔常資助之。惟陳君因用腦過度，患有遺精症，初時每月不過三四次，繼者逐漸增加，後竟至每夜必遺，過於疲勞之後，日間或亦間有滑精。於是神思恍惚，夜常失眠，稍一思索，即覺頭昏腦脹，耳鳴眼花，是以學業成績一落千丈，若稍一操勞，即覺腰酸背痛，肢體疲備不堪，幾至不能支持，臥床不起矣！陳君因受此痛苦之打擊，頓萌厭世之念，一日正書就絕命書，意欲投浦自盡，奈為同學發見，加以勸阻，并為之介紹至本診所診治，經余祥察其病狀後，即囑其同學赴五洲大藥房購『希米脫氏固精片』二匣及生殖腺素製　劑『生殖素』兩打，使之兼服。并間日施用電療注射等新醫術，經一月之悉心診治，至本月初為時不過一月，而已百病霍然，又成為一個活躍健壯，好學聰明之青年矣。</p>
<p>（二）腎虧丈夫應為你愛妻着想</p>
<p>趙志明君，年廿六歲，客歲冬間結婚，其妻固一娟好之少女也，趙君雖愛之，但在夫婦生活中每感心餘力絀之苦，因此愛情亦非常淡薄，爰趙君於婚後有早洩，陽痿症象，偶有遺精。趙君有時思及其妻，心中疚恨萬分：乃於上月親至本診所欲根治其病症，余卽囑其購生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』兩打，『希米脫氏固精片』一匣，使之兼服，為時月餘，頃已覺精力強壯，病態全愈，夫婦間愛情深篤，誠如趙君者，真可謂愛其妻子者矣，</p>

<h3>南洋一帶風雲險惡　日本在緬甸的陰謀</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福會於上星期內宣佈，美國艦隊將無定期留駐太平洋。美國海軍總司令李嘉遜上將昨又宜稱，美國艦隊原定於七月初駛往太平洋沿岸各港巡弋，茲已作罷。同時據同盟社海南島電，日本駐華艦隊司令島田中將巳到該島「視察」。字林西報東京電則謂，日本與蘇聯目前所簽訂之諾蒙享劃界協定，一方面可以預防該處在今年夏季再發生職事，一方面雙方可以放手在別處發展。日蘇兩國旣無須在滿洲方面互相監視，蘇聯儘可在波羅的海等處擴展，日本亦可乘機推行南進政策。關於日本的南進政策，本報昨巳發表譯文兩篇，這再將紐的泰晤士報所載上海通訊，　譯如下：</p>
<p>遠在一八九二年前，英國首相薩里斯波雷助爵即堅決主張，對中國政府借款條件，應規定准許英國資本築一鐵路，將緬甸之仰光，與長江上遊之四川省連接。</p>
<p>在那時代，中國政府竭力反對此項計劃。法國自越南向北發展的慾望，也被同樣反對。然時全今日，却有七萬五千愛國華工忙於建築此項路綫，並有一家英國公司在經濟上援助。中國對此固極贊成，法國亦然。</p>
<p>這是重要的開發及政治　重要調擊的一種遠大計劃，所以產生這樣結果的，乃由於日本侵略中國，封鎖中國海岸，及日本佔領中國主要海口之故。</p>
<p>美國貿易，由於日本侵華，損失極重，而緬甸目前佔重要的新地位，不但是因其為中國進出口的後門，並且也是英帝國在亞洲大陸的東方邊境。</p>
<p>日本旣實際上使滇越鐵路，失其輸送軍用品之用，對於滇緬公路之日佔重要，因極注意。但一直至目前為止，日本並沒有轟炸重慶通緬甸的　成公路，及在中國境內的未成鐵路，而只在緬甸境內活動，冀　此項重要通商及給養來源的道路失共効用。</p>
<p>按照一九三一年的人口調查，緬甸全境只有六百六十七個日本人。目前日僑總數，巳超過四千人。目前在每一個緬甸村莊中，都有一個或兩個的日本牙醫，並設有照像材料店，表面上賣風景片及廉價的照相機。</p>
<p>緬甸村民及農民，對於現代牙醫並不重視，而普通人也極貧窮，無力愛好照相機。但這些人却都聽信日本間諜親日反英的宣傳，日本間諜說日本是命運注定了要祖負遠東解放任務的民族。</p>
<p>英國當局也明白這種情事，因為在一九三八年初，日本間諜在仰光的總部指揮之下，化了很多時間與金錢，援助緬甸民族運動，希望用擾亂秩序暴動及地方叛變來打擊田滇緬鐵路及公路輸送軍火至中國。</p>
<p>緬旬面積三七〇，〇〇〇英方里，據最近的人口調查，共有一四，六六七，〇〇〇人，但這些人民，却因宗族的敵視而分裂，並且有一百三十稱不同的語言。這樣複雜社會組織，對於日本間諜，極為　　，日本閒諜，獲得了極　民族黨「苗契特」的援助，挑撥宗族間的仇恨。</p>
<p>該黨最近對英政府及緬甸總督，發出通吿，要求終止軍用品由緬境運往中國。</p>
<p>在一九三八年末，當緬甸叛亂　於極點時，仰光報界公佈所謂日本政府致仰光日本領事館的訓令，而此項文件，日方從未加以否認。其要點如下</p>
<p>「緬甸叛變的發生，可　斷重慶政府所運的軍火　過該國山地輸往中國，叛黨應摧毀緬邊河道上的橋樑，貨物運輸延選與危險。甚至可截取此種軍火。」</p>
<p>目前中國從世界各國所獲的接濟，是從仰光登陸，德國的接濟用義大利船載來，上面無德國商標。三個美國航綫目前　以仰光為其必靠口岸。</p>
<p>從仰光，這些軍用品由鐵路運至中緬交界之臘戍，或上溯伊洛瓦底江　八莫。自臘戍至中國邊境，緬甸政府會建造一條七十七英里的公路。從中緬邊境，即可由渝緬公路達中國行都重慶。</p>
<p>一家美國公司並已在緬甸邊境即滇緬公路通至中國之處，建設了一所規模宏大的飛機廠，另一廠，則建造於仰光。</p>
<p>如果中國每天在邊境開出一百輛運　汽車，每一輛裝載三百噸，那未每月輸人九千噸的重要軍需。但汽車至重慶的路程，需時兩星期，這樣必須經常維持一千四百輛運貨汽車往來駛行。這數目還不包括專載汽油及零件的汽車在內。</p>
<p>中國目前在這公路開駛的汽軍，的有一千輛，每年可通車七個月，每月又輸入六千噸。合計起來，六月至十月為幽季，屆時，洪水會衝毀橋樑及損毀路基，因之該路不能儘量運輸。</p>
<p>至對外輸出，中國政府所有汽車，大致用以運載中國最有利益的出口貨，如桐油，猪鬃，皮革，　，　，之類。</p>
<p>問時中國繼續進行鐵路建設工作，重慶通仰光的鐵路交通，不久即可完成。路基巳很快在進展中，隧道也多巳開鑿，有些地帶，路軌已經鋪設。茲望能在一九四一年申，完成此綫。到了那時，緬甸境內仰光至臘戍一綫即可擴張至中緬邊境，與王國境內的鐵路啣接，而薩里斯波雷四十八年前的計劃，也可實現了。</p>
<p>英國開始征服緬甸是在一八二年，但一直到一八八六年，還沒有把全境征服。緬甸以前是四個獨立王，曾一度與印度合併好多年，但到了一九三七年，英國深恐民族解放運動的開展，又與印度分裂，成為另一殖民地。</p>
<p>從軍事的意義講，緬甸是印度第二道重要防綫，星嘉坡是第一道重要防綫。在今日情形之下，雖歐洲大戰當前，當但加强緬甸東方的防衛，仍極注意——共目的顯就是對日——目　緬甸百分之十四的收入是作為軍事之用。</p>
<p>一九三九年七月，印度總督曾與緬甸總督及其他軍事專家，關於調整國防計劃，作一長時間的重要會議。此次會議的結果，緬甸中要軍用品的生產，業已增加，空軍也加擴大，飛機塲則增加兩倍以上，而海岸的防衛也加改進。</p>
<p>緬甸主要戰時生產是煤油，鐵砂，煤，鉛，鵭，米，苧麻。</p>
<p>這龐大的地帶，現已成為英國重要的邊疆，僑居的歐洲人民，連軍人文官都計算在內，只有二萬八千人，除此而外，不過有極少數的央國人而巳</p>
<h3>大兵之後必有凶年　歐洲瀕於飢荒</h3>
<p>數月以來，記者足跡遍歷歐洲大部份，觀察所得，深信歐洲將遇飢饉。記者曾在羅馬尼亞邊省富庶之區某大地主家　客七日，地主致歉曰，「一年前，余當派汽車相迎，惟今汽車巳被軍隊徵　殆盡，即農　載重車及曳引車亦遭徵去，我人不得不以獨輪車代步。所謂「我人」者，壯丁從軍去，留下老殘婦孺，相依度日。來年此時，將無物尤飢矣。」</p>
<p>由此向北，蘇聯軍隊虎視眈眈。廣大麥田中巳掘就曲折連綿的塹壕。記者旋穿越布柯維　區，此乃雜馬尼亞產穀之地。德　牲畜小麥取給於該處者至少有百分之十二。惟該處　軌鐵路，運油往德，擁擠異常，絕無食物運輸。</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞境內尙有波蘭難民十萬人，日耗口糧甚多。羅罵尼亞有遭三面攻擊之虞，乃動員軍隊的二百萬人，飽食無事，坐令農事荒蕪。比經南斯拉夫，土耳其，希臘與保加利亞，所見所聞，吿屬同樣景象，第見戍兵終日閒散，四週田壤荒蕪而已。</p>
<p>義大利糧食問題亦甚殺重。該國土地可耕者僅什二，其殖民地供給甚微，即巴爾幹半島所供給之些微糧食，亦被英法等國購去。義國境內食物價格，一星期間高漲什　，國積者奇貨可居，此輩奸商，一月中被捕者達　萬三千人。</p>
<p>西班牙景况尤為　劣。一年前，政府軍與國民軍對壘，蹂躪全國，大軍過處，糧食被掠一空，果園夷為平地。凡能充飢之牲畜，莫不宰殺殆盡。即其他牲口，可代牛取乳者，縱出高償，亦無法購得。村民無牛乳麵包者，竟歷多日。</p>
<p>匈牙利去年歉收，兼以波蘭難民十萬人源源入境。該國已調整麺包產量，並規定每星期中二日不食肉。該國人口約一百萬，農民居多數，現亦被束縛於武器之下。他如荷蘭及比利時，各遭兵　，巳以糧食匱乏聞矣。　（未完）</p>

<h3>時局動盪不定中　滬人應鎭靜自處　自由巿建議不為各方重視　英法大使暫留滬應付事機</h3>
<p>自義大利參戰後、形勢擴大至地中海、一方法德有和平消息、而東方之法西斯野心蓬勃、乘此千戰難逢之時機、南進企圍、日益顯著、因之本埠人心搖動、羣起猜疑、而偽方亦居然想在此時趁火打刦、聞偽「市長」傅筱庵、於昨日送交正式書面於各交戰國領事、請求交戰國防軍退出租界、問時外報又有人建議欲將上海變為自由市、於是人心益見動燙、究共實際、歐戰演變、無關遠東、充其量亦不過航業上略受影響、傳筱庵之請求、早經租界防軍長官策劃萬全、當不致發生任何摩擦、無須顧顧過慮、所謂自由市一層、八一三時、曾有人提議、此事因與中國主權有關、未成事實、今則無非舊調重彈、至美國對中國一貫政策、凡以武力或其他方法改變中國主樣與領土概不承認、今茲建議、自當為美所反對、可無疑義、惟市塲方面、自昨接香港方面傳來消息、日軍巳由桂省邊境三路進攻諒山、又傳海防與香港海道不通、一時人心、又起浮動、實則處此局勢、一切均以冷靜態度處之、持以鎭定、不為浮言所動、自可處之泰然矣、各方情形、彙誌如次，</p>
<p>有人建議設自由市</p>
<p>據英文大美晚報載稱、上海外人方面，有人建議、將上海劃為「自由市」、藉以保障國際都市之未來安全、根據該項計劃、全上海均將成為非武裝區、四週設立中立地帶、「自由市」包括五區、甲區為目前之公共租界、乙區為法租界、丙區為蘇州河以北地帶及該處之越界築路地帶、丁區為法和界以南及虹橋路以南地帶、戊區為黃浦江右岸地帶、此「自由市」將另設法庭·警務·領港管轄等機關、而由列强共管之、根據此項計劃、上海將成為一國際管理之保護政治經濟之市政機關、又謂上項計劃、出領事團當局擬定、係一備忘錄方式之文件、</p>
<p>領團方面</p>
<p>領事團秘書朗格、對此項謠傅、斥為無稽之談、朗氏指出在過去數年間、確有此種計劃之提議、但目下則絕對不知有此一事云、據某觀察家談、此項計劃、在八一三時、曾有人提出建議、今舊事重提、認為係金融資本家之自私主張、以運日由於某方之大施謠言攻勢、以致人心惶惶、此輩遂作此試探式之倡議、以保持其鉅額游資、俾得在滬作祟、</p>
<p>妨害中國領土主權</p>
<p>據國際專家某君談、　於此項計劃、想係外人方面一二私人之意見、蓋　海租界、其領土主樣、整個屬於中國、依據該項計劃、根本將領土割裂、與中國脫離聯擊損害中國領土主權、至鉅且大、如果欲實現此項計劃、絕非中國政府所能容許、</p>
<p>欲策安全應謀合作</p>
<p>某君又稱、目前安定租界之妥善辦法、惟有各國依照歷次議決之方案、堅持決心共同維持現狀、某方雖野心勃勃、虎視耽耽、各國密切合作、沉着應付、某方當亦無所施其技倆、目下租界局勢之安謐如恒、實得九於各國措置得宜、此時如忽有「自由市」計劃，建議、適足以庸人自擾、授人以可乘之隙也、</p>
<p>滬郊偽軍人數寥寥</p>
<p>昨日英文大美晚報戰稱、據傳稱南京偽軍有五萬人自江寗區秘密開抵上海、頗引起此間對於圖攫取上海租界之疑慮、是項偽軍之開到、據謂係隨歐戰發展消息之後、先是謠傅日偽計擬　取法租界、同時聞悉、法租界巳採取緊急之防範、以防止任何不測之發展、當局聲稱、決租界內各項事務、仍賡續照常進行、至未來發展、則法租界官員保持絨默、惟謂現狀當完全保持不變、關於日本對於上海租界、將採取直接行動之謠傳、詢諸日本大使館發言人時、據稱、是項謠言、全無根據、惟宣稱、「如歐洲局勢有非常重大變遷日本或當採取若干行動、惟其他中國方面消息稱、滬郊偽軍、至多不能超過一二千、其間數百名、開抵南市者、為任援道所屬之偽「水巡隊」、</p>
<p>英法大使暫留上海</p>
<p>英國大使寇爾罰士、於本月十六日晨由港抵滬、在此非常時期、大使行踪、嚴守秘密、所乘何輸、亦無從獲悉、抵埠後、即赴惇信路官邱休息數日來深　簡出、絕少酬酢、此後行止、尙未決定、法大使戈斯默、前傳決定於十六日離滬、赴北戴河避暑、至今仍未成行、自法國向德求禾消息傳滬後法領事館職員無分上下、忙碌異常、法大使亦取消華北之行、蘇聯領事館自關閉後、一度會傳行將軍開、並傳駐然後冉定方針之說、實屬不確、故蘇聯領館仍繼續關閉、至於蘇聯駐滬官方通訊社則尙繼續存在、最近曾由莫斯科總社另派一新人來滬主持、</p>
<p>意方竭力防止摩擦</p>
<p>自意大利參戰後、在華各國僑民、使館、近會勸吿意國在滬軍民與交戰國僑民力避不祥事件、同時天津意總領事兼意租界工部局董事長蒲里基、北平意大使館武官兼衛隊長克華西尼亦均通吿意僑、力避與交戰國僑民磨擦、至英法在華各地租界當局均竭力維持租界之中立地位、本埠及天津英法租界德意兩國僑民、均照常居住、遷移者僅極少數、故彼此不致發生事件、且有美國在華外交當局居間排解仲裁、益可消患於未形、使覬覦者無所籍口、</p>
<h3>日軍人頌揚華軍　襄西將士樂於戰死　宜昌守軍肉搏作戰</h3>
<p>南京日軍總司令部報導部長馬淵上校、最近會往囊西親察戰况、據具發表觀感、略云、歐洲戰爭、雖有軍司令官以下全軍降伏之事、但襄西華軍則絕無將兵結成集團投降者、自張自忠起、將校士兵均皆勇戰奮鬥、至最後陣亡而死、宜昌北方山岳戰、亦會進展至白刃戰後、復展開格鬥戰（意即肉搏戰）此種氣槪、殊與默洲戰塲士兵不同、馬淵並稱頌此為「滅私奉公之精神、」</p>
<h3>美名醫談內地情形表示樂觀　糧貯極為充裕　一切均有進步</h3>
<p>美國醫師勃郎博士、在華從事敎會醫業巳多年、足跡幾遍全中國、近自內地來滬、不久將取道日本轉返美國、茲在上海小作勾留、承其對記者吿以內地之一般情形，據勃郎博士稱、渠深信中國必獲最後勝利、並對於自由中國各區所表顯之偉大精神與工作、表示欽折、內地食物、不虞缺乏、而四川一省、尤有過剩之米糧、內地人民對於各種時事</p>
<p>消息靈通並極明瞭各種難題、尤奇者、內地窮鄉僻處之小村、往往設有小型之無綫電收音礦石機、藉以聆取各種最近之新聞、並立即轉吿四周鄉村之居民、余（博士自稱）曾憶有一年老之工友、當余吿以余為美國人時、頓時容光煥發、謂余曰「我們都知道美國是帮助我們中國的」、博士又稱、山西省主席現正在陝西訓練三千</p>
<p>靑年軍官以備馳聘前綫渠曾吿余謂、日軍雖佔領山西省全部、但除一二大市鎭外、各縣之長官均為效忠於國家者、內地某縣地方官曾吿余謂、內地各處人民、均精誠團結、尤可於各地人民應募入伍之踴躍見之、此蓋大半由於日機濫施</p>
<p>轟炸反應</p>
<p>勃郎博士繼向記者述及各鄉村如何訓練小組人員、然後會集於較大之中心點、加以更進一步之訓練、中國飛機為數尙嫌不足、但小兵器現均由中國自製、產量甚大、第八路軍某軍官曾向渠謂、「東京之兵工廠、並不使吾人失望」、其意蓋指第八路軍由日軍處奪得大批軍用品也、</p>
<h3>法政府已封鎖海防　暫時戒備性質　滬輪止於香港</h3>
<p>歐洲戰事擴張後、遠東方面亦發生各種流言、對於荷屬東印度及南洋羣島、奪取之謠言、近已消弭、自巴黎被德軍佔據後、更有進窺法屬安南之傳說、昨午本市航業界、接海防分行報吿、法政府為防範起見、實行將海防暫行封鎖、禁止出入口、自香港開往海防之一切船隻、均巳無限期停止、</p>
<p>裕生退票</p>
<p>怡和洋行裕生輪、原定今晨由滬赴查港海防、因上述消息、對於售出之海防客票、一律退票、運往海防貨物、亦通知客家退關、該輸暫以至香港為止、等待繼續消息、如能去者、仍擬駛海防、太古公司昨午濟南輪自滬開往華南、至香港·廣州灣·海口而赴海防、但海防封鎖消息到滬、該輸業已出口、故能吾到海防、須至香港後始可決定、惟探詢該公司、據謂尙無確實報吿、</p>
<p>船單停簽</p>
<p>香港當局對於駛往海防之船隻、拒絕簽發出港單、此一消息、昨日巳由本埠航業界加以證實、惟據稱此項辦法、或係暫時性質、本埠大多數輪船公司、擁有不少船隻、來往於上海與法屬安南間、而尤以載運西貢米為其中最大之航運、多數運米船、並不停靠香港而直接在上海與海防問駛行、目下港當局所採取之態度、係屬戒備性質、以待朱來之發展、</p>

<p>先後又死、並致函家屬勒贖五萬元、會取得三千元、事被中央捕房所悉、乃除將兩鍾及王拘捕、並連同嫌疑犯劉炳成·徐金祥·姚和祥·王尙賢等、一併解送特一院訊押、各情已誌本報、昨晨此案由劉毓桂推事升座刑二庭續訊、各界仕女以此案綁匪等旣將三孩綁架、當晚先後弄死、復藉此要挾、施其勒贖技倆、其手段之毒辣、存心之險惡、實屬</p>

<p>虹口公園、三被吿開始商議、以旣將三孩架得、如何辦法、如將藏匿、苦無處所、設或釋回、又恐面目熟識、難免將來破案、乃頓起殺心、遂挈至東方圖書館荒地、將三孩先後义死、並將衣服剝下典質、埋尸瓦礫中、後乃函致孩之家屬、稱小孩身體甚健、現需贖款五萬元、約期接洽、當時三孩之家屬、初尙未悉孩巳被綁、祇悉失踪、故曾在報上刋登</p>

<h3>買聲四起　金巿漲勢轉劇　最高抬至五千七百七十五元</h3>
<p>昨日現令烚赤暗盤市況、續向上挺、買氣較前為盛、故漲勢亦漸增劇、中因滙市報緊、更使人心興奮、雖環境變幻莫測、但藏金仍為上策、論半日經過、晨開堅而不昂、乃某錢兌業巨額售出、致五千六百三十元、開盤後曾升數十元、終受挫而復跌、嗣外滙緊勢頗俏、塲內買聲四起、一時捧高至五千七百七十五元、但證券幫現金號等均反手叫賣、遂即降達五千七百元關口、後賴金號力持、吿五千七百四十元收盤、結果較上日猛漲一百五十元、午後週三無市、半天交易的三千數百兩、銀樓飾金掛高二十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>洽平漲一百五十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以滙市微緊、經營者頗有買胃、致開市做高四十元、銀號進金號二十兩、為五千六百三十元、繼因銀號幫暨金號及證券幫等需要甚旺、雖斯時某錢兌業舉出有數、但頭寸尚感不敷、旦於外匯走緊中、終又拉起五十五元、金號進錢兌業五十兩、為五千六百九十五元、此後滙市止緊趨平、且某錢兌業仍繼續吐出、而買者已漸稍減、遂回落三十五元、銀號進錢兌業三十兩、為五千六百六十元、旋乃外匯重又告緊、因本埠盛傳某軍在越南登陸之說、但據本報所得消息、海防方面、法軍自動封鎖、以防某國覬覦云、一時買風再起、銀號證券幫等爭先收吸、且不久某錢兌業亦來補空、未幾遂飛漲一百十五尤、金號進銀號二十兩、為五千七百七十五元、十一時後買者轉少、證券幫及銀號幫多頭乘高出籠、加之斯時現金號代客售出、回小七十元、證券幫出錢兌業三十兩、為五千七百〇五元、午刻證券幫復來撈進、且金號幫亦有拖入、雖某銀號多　仍有出籠、但終提升三十五元銀號出金號十兩、為五千七百四十元作午收價、結果比上日軋漲一百五十元、收後堅挺、五千七百六十元尚乏賣戶、半天百四十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出、價照烚赤較高十數元、收進減低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均　做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金連漲念元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百七十元、迨至九時半掛高十元、十時四十分又大十元、此後無變化、結果大同行改懸五百九十元、新同行與上價相同、收進減低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>最勢利的表現　只要美鈔　拒收法郞安南票</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤盤旋趨漲、英美金鎊跟隨上漲、英金票供求仍勻、市價站牛、美余票於上午曾高至十七元三角、午間回至十七元一角五分、午後忽傳英閣或將改祖、外滙及烚赤因週三無市、一般咸改購美金票、故晚市又高至十七半三角半、比上日軋漲五角半、香港票則續降一分、法郎及安南票又遭錢兌同業拒收、故市態呆定、菲列濱票稍有需嬰、市價略漲、日金票供求尚勻、晚市仍一元零八分、朝鮮票仍小乏需要、市價略漲、晚市為九角五分、</p>
<h3>糧食　投機米商散播流言　洋米抬得分外高昂</h3>
<p>米市辛昨日午市、忽以銷路暢旺、竟復反疲還緊、一律飛騰二元有奇、乃天時晴正、人心轉堅、若浙省及鄉莊客戶均思來廉暢辦、一時買氣頓旺、賣方趁機扳俏、形勢旣緊、一般浮囤散戶專事投機者、亦即從中吸收、同時目將手中獲利貨稍事出籠、藉以互相抬價、當見各色洋米行情一升冉升、在中市頃刻之間、已增元外、及後愈轟愈烈、竟將前市回落之數、悉為恢復、經此方見平穩、無復繼起、直迨收市常不過徘徊於三五角之間、結果收盤價、一號陳西貢五十九元五十八元半、二號五十七元、一號暹邏五十八元半、五十八元、二號五十七元，火絞五十八元、小絞銀行棧五十六元半、浦東棧五十六元二角、五十六元、東京砶尖五十六元、五十五元，米菉五十二元半、五十二元、不過碎尖以新到貨擁擠異常、而後批續有鉅額訂就、銷塲反較他貨為細、是以獨乏榮辱、高貨開五十元、次至四十八元半、及至下午、市上謠言尤盛、若航運被阻也、海防登陸也、以及其他之謠霄莫不有利於買方、盲從者紛紛收買、投機者趁機活動、新囤暢辦浮空補買、皮球生意愈見熱鬧、市價逐抬逐高、及至晚市結果各米又被抬起二元之鉅、小紋浦東棧五十七元半、銀行棧則至五十八元、二號西貢與暹邏半數至五十八元半、一號西買開五十九元半後、又喊至前日一度見市之六十元高價火絞五十九元、比之前日晚收、莫不昂達三元之鉅、惟昨市之暴漲實被謠言所激引、倘謠言被事實所否認、則其反跌亦必有勁也、新交易千前成交小絞六月二十八日裝五百噸、價六十一元半、　孚　與米商、回籠開出八百五十噸、　號　米六十三元半、又西貢六十二元半、碎米五十四元、現洋米開出一萬三千包、</p>
<p>粳　國米、昨到仍共千餘包傳聞粳米塲外暗盤、因前回跌之後、又引起各銷暢辦、貨價相隨洋米並提二元、常帮特淸粳六十八元半、六十八元、蘇崑常州白粳特自六十八元、决革宿熱者六十六元、　泗特薄六十七八元、南港早稻六十五六元、糯米價盤旣廉、內地去路頓旺、更兼大戶囤收、致較他貨尤俏、竟開金溧持元五十四五元、常丹白元五十三四元、江北白元五十一二元、獨漲二三元云云、</p>
<h3>粉巿明定暗俏　新麥湧到恐尚有待</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日二號粉廠盤仍為十三元八角、客盤為十六元二角半至十六元一角、市面依然堅挺、緣目下新麥來源迄未暢通、原料將感缺乏、本街實銷、因米貴而有增無減、客銷方面、南洋幫去化亦稱聯蟬、所以各廠漸有應付不暇之態、統市成交各粉的計一萬三千餘包、市面明定暗佾、恐不久本街批價或有增加之實現、老車牌回籠貨及內地雜牌粉供源仍寥、</p>
<p>小麥　來源尚未疏通、雖傳有京滬路及附近新麥之運到、照目下環境而言、則其到貨形似走私所謂各顯神通而已、更傳某廠收進若干、合價若干者、非與某方接近者勢難明晰、但父無從證實、是以各地新麥雖曰上市已久、而本埠以環境不良、恐湧旺時期、尚有待焉、</p>
<p>出口　糧食類之運往外埠者、計今日有麵粉·一千包、又有豆子三百包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>證券　內債厄於謠諑　外股臨末一度興奮</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況又為無稽之謠所包圍、漲風頓挫而轉跌、祇要本息如期照付、債信決無動搖之理、一般庸人自擾、致使債市不易抬頭、上午信孚出籠、久豐再賣、鴻康補空、同昌益昌均有買進、午後二娥，午後騙益鴻大益昌及三十八號先後均有寶出、聯和大　貿進、但空頭仍佔優勞，續見稍疲、人心不振、前途又不易看好、結果小一角半至四角半、成交總數共計約五十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大生第一紗廠股七十五股、價為十四元九角、</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市、趨勢甚穩、交易小多直至最後一小時、因滙市緊佾、始有較多買戶出現、但未幾父轉寗靜、</p>
<p>倫敦十八日（週二）電、今日英商速東各公司股蔡掛牌行市、滙鹽銀行股重吿疲落、英倫註冊股跌三鎊、價為七十四鎊、香港註冊股跌二鎊、為七十八鎊、其餘不動、</p>
<p>倫敦十八日（週二）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍吿平平、上下檔各債券概無變動、</p>
<p>英商利喊汽車有限公司一九四〇年份股息、定於六月二十七日先派中期股息、每股國幣二元、</p>
<h3>紗花　機機意興闌珊　紗市跌風加厲　雙馬見一一〇七元</h3>
<p>紗市績疲、且跌風復起、此因歐洲戰事變什多端、尤使人心飄　靡定、所以投機者殊難捉摸、但外滙又縮、而黃金昂勝、然紗市未能隨之上升、此乃買力缺乏興趣、同時實際銷路不及昔日之旺、加之原料廉宜、囤戶觀望也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開市象尚和平、但後塲中買戶寥寥、同時廣帮對於二十支紗採辦較鮮、人心更挫、直跌至一千一百元、雖外滙縮風復起、然市面未能提高、依然沉悶之至、實則投機者忽然闌珊、檯面清閑、收盤價為一千一百〇七元、查半日間成交統計一千四百七十包較　十支雙馬行情跌三十九元、今日有紗九百八十五件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　一、一八〇　香港　二　五</p>
<p>寗波　一三　內地　一、四七〇</p>
<p>福州　　四　統計　一、四七〇</p>
<h3>業中觀望　棉市沉寂</h3>
<p>中外現棉交易、完全入於停頓狀態中、此因世界局勢變化多端、使人難以捉摸、投機者無從下手矣、同時紗市凋敝不振、海外棉市亦在易跌難漲之中，所以經營者、大都在觀望中云、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市　、紐約棉市、晨初先受賣方之壓力而略跌、後因大衆之購買及一部份空頭之抵補、市況回堅、結果收盤價格較之今日漲起十三四磅音、印度市況亦頗穩定、昨日連同預測、漲起三羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊呈呆滯之狀、各方交易靜寂、俱靜候歐洲之消息、然市上人心頗為良好也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙五元八一二五折合期貨送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　三〇〇·五〇〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　二九一·〇〇</p>
<p>三二支　又　三一〇·九〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　三〇〇·六〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　　一二·五〇</p>
<p>又　又　下級　三　一二·四〇</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤源源到滬</h3>
<p>洋煤如鴻基、同得利白煤、產地難處於法屬鴻基·安南、但不受歐戰影響、航綫仍照常通行、新貨源源到滬、日昨曼理輪又出該地裝來鴻基白煤二千四百餘噸、業已抵埠、在洋涇浜起卸、故洋煤來源、無虞斷檔云、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日美絲價回跌　本市絲商居奇</h3>
<p>昨日美絲市、致下回、紐的近期跌五分、遠期跌五分半、橫濱現貨小十五元、遠期小二十三元、洋莊吃價隨之下落、蓋歐戰前途變化尚多、市氣不無顯現觀望之態、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、因出運問題尚無一定辦法、內地絲經現僅受阻、據云新「捐」值百抽分之十二、須在七月初徵收、然亦無具體消息、是故手貨居奇、一般絲商均不欲輕售、昨輯里下千聞吃價二一五〇元、但未聞成交、</p>
<h3>洋莊茶銷一蹶不振</h3>
<p>本市洋莊綠茶、因內地來源苛捐雜稅增重、成本較舊提高數倍、而歐洲局勢日緊、國外止裝電訊紛至沓來、市面遂呈一蹶小振之勢、昨市僅協和怡和等行、購進珍眉綠茶七十餘箱、價開二百六十元至二百七十五元、較前又跌十餘元、現下全市百餘家製茶廠、祇一二十家勉力製貨、</p>
<p>又茶葉昨日由寗波來一百九十　、今日有三百包、運往香港、</p>
<h3>疋頭南海不靖影響布銷</h3>
<p>布　以海防香港綫統輪停、日方有侵諒山之說、影響西南布銷、惟外匯暴縮、又屬利多、故人心忐忑、同業賣買驟稀、囤戶亦鮮興趣、致一部份布價每疋微挫三角半至五角、然以匯兌關係、國外出口稍增、同時各路內銷、亦略有進展、本街批發號進府綢·洋紗·漂布·坯布六千餘疋、浙皖帮亦辦四五千疋、粵帮辦色布·細布一百數十件、烟津帮辦藍布·士林布百餘箱、國外暹·邏星加坡等地辦府綢及漂染各布七八千疋、港帮辦斜紋·漂布·府綢二千餘疋、二十日運香港疋頭八十二件、</p>
<p>東布客銷鈍滯如故、投機商仍傾向拋賣，致市盤乃愈壓愈小、龍頭細布晨開每疋三十四元外、降至三十三元四五角、四君子嗶嘰每碼八角九分跌至八角八分二厘半、收盤時嗶嘰形勢較堅、回至八角八分七厘半、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白轉升</h3>
<p>昨糖市以買戶進胃較多、復趨上展、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧上午七十元半、下午七十一元、升一元、外棧六十九元六角至七十元、下午〇二角、計升四角、轉口貨初為五十五元一角、步升至五角、下午再升至七角、計升七角、太古車白B嘜八十　元半、無更動、荷赤五十九元半、升角、本廠雪白七十　元、升半元、一號冰及晶明冰均乏更勸、屆槍由潮帮開出漳州刁靑　百二十包、六十二元、</p>
<h3>五金　白鉛皮市勢呆</h3>
<p>久趨岑寂之白鉛皮市、昨仍無起色、蓋津烟靑諸幫客商、俱少採辦、而本街電池廠交易亦微、刻市之成交者、僅靠門莊　隅、因之市象簫條、人心亦軟、目下行情除六號及十六號因市貨軋缺、　　俏堅外，其餘均告下游、</p>
<h3>油市　荳油疲備如故　生油平疲不一</h3>
<p>豆油潛势依然疲憊、總之銷塲不繼、來源不少、致操縱無從下手、故狹隘大局、難以發展、昨祇交易大連豆油十桶、價為九十八元、比上日市再跌一元半、烟岐豆油一百件、價為七十元原盤、（聞　裝油由虹口轉出須加苛捐、）及大有廠豆油一百祖、價為七十五元、花生油平疲不一、大都依銷塲冷淡為轉移、昨香港帮續辦江北本坊油一百聽、價仍開一百元、本街妥去烟台油二百聽、價為九十元、及江北門莊油十桶、價為九十四元五角、</p>

<h3>重修靜安寺緣起</h3>
<p>滬上靜安寺，建自孫吳，初名重元寺，後改永泰禪院，宋祥符間，始改今額。元周弼記略謂：晋建興元年，有二石佛，浮沉吳淞江口，漁者復於沙際獲石缽二，遂皆供奉寺中，頗著靈應。屢經兵燹，石佛曾移置吳門，不知尚存在與否。寺中有赤烏碑、陳朝檜講經台、蝦子潭、湧泉、綠雲洞諸勝蹟，自元明以至國朝，屢修屢圮。咸豐末年，四郊多壘，更不堪問。後僧鶴峰思葺而新之，以捐資不繼，兼與工程師搆釁，僅備木料，旋值西北省奇荒，善士傾囊助賑，先其所急。今里人尤寺僧之請，欲竟其未竟之功；惟工程較鉅，端藉眾力維持，為述建寺始末，與邇年與土中輟之故，以廣善緣而昭眾信，俾千餘年廟貌重新，則諸置檀越公德無量矣。</p>

<h3>死光不足畏</h3>
<p>— 新枬</p>
<p>在歐戰爆發後，人人都預料交戰國不知將用什麽文明（？）武器來應戰。事實固然不錯，德軍繼續地應用了幾件新武器——電磁性水雷，噴火鐵甲車等。希特勒一面用新武器作戰，一面還將用另一種新武器來威脅；於是大家都回想到聞名已久而至今尚未應用的「死光」。</p>
<p>「死光」，據說是一種短波的光綫，其光波甚至比X光還要短得多；因為由學理知道，光波愈短的所含的能量愈大，也就是射在身體上時對於身體的破壞力愈大。我們知道X光是一定要由醫生來照的：一方面固然因為只有醫生才能利用X光來檢查體內的缺陷；另一方面却因為X光照射的時間等都與體質大有關係。換句話說：X光不能照射在人體上過久，不然必遭受意外的損害，尤其是眼部。光波較長的X光尚且如此，何况是光波短得多的「死光」呢？</p>
<p>「死光」至今還不免是一個謎，所以理論，說來雖是可能的，但是目前是否已有一種發射「死光」的機械，的確還是一個問題。於是就有人說，這是不可能的事，是白癡者的誇言。其實也不必如此，因為據透露消息，德國科學家確已發明一種光綫，而且曾用以殺過一隻老鼠，據說成績很是圓滿；不過我們却不知此種光綫是否曾試之人類，是否　在千萬人前實地試騐。也許牠只能殺小動物而不能殺人，也許牠只能殺一二個人而不能殺千萬個人。</p>
<p>據美國最近傳來消息，說德國的「死光」只能使人暫時昏迷，不能殺人，所以是一種非常人道的「武器」其實旣是「武器」，就根本沒有人道和不人道之別；除非射出的砲彈是麵包，槍彈是糖果，「死光」是電燈的　用品。但是話又得說回來，「死光」雖是不人道，但是事實上一定也無甚可怕：在室內用X光來專門檢騐一個人的身體，在上海也得要費去十多塊錢，在戰塲上漫無目標的使用，效力當然要减少得多；所以我認為專用「死光」來殺千萬條人命，其消費一定也大得可以的。同時當進攻的時候，放射「死光」，恐怕也難免與敵人遺留的糧食——不論動植物——無礙。於是進攻的軍隊不能不携大量的糧食同行。所以想用「死光」以加緊進攻，事實上恐怕也難能達到的。故現在我們姑不論是否已有「死光」發明，我們總認為就是有「死光」，其能力也一定有限，而不足恐懼的。</p>

<h3>旱災</h3>
<p>— 卓</p>
<p>在上海吃着五六十元一擔米，是米蛀蟲在作祟，素稱出米的故鄉，最近米　也高漲到五十多塊錢一擔，心裏有點奇怪，當我接到了來信，方始恍然，那信上寫着：「最近故鄉米價大漲，每擔五十三元，此價大約與滬地不相上下了吧？並且已有兩個多月沒有下雨，河裏的水淺得已見了底，早稻因沒有水已不能插秧了。倘若再不下雨，可怕的旱災要降臨了。」</p>
<p>在前次來信上，又說及河道壅塞着障碍物，××人為着防遊擊隊，在每條河道裏，築成了一個個小柵，河裏的水不能流通，農夫車水也不能夠了，而且夏季裏的時疫，猜想會格外的猖獗。倘然這幾天再不大量的下雨，那旱災一定要成功了。但在這人禍已受得很夠足的江南，還要加上天災，如何消受得了呢！</p>
<p>於是，我想着雨，巴望着下大雨。</p>
<p>早上起來，烏雲滿天，正飄着細雨，我希望下得大，越大越好。但這不過是希望，天竟慢慢的晴起來，連細雨也沒有了，當我早上出外預備做我刻板工作的時候，我願意下雨，讓我覺得些來回路上不便常被我認擺為苦惱後的喜悅，但我竟失望了。路旁擺飯攤的也在談論着這事，希望下雨，而願意損失他們的生意。於是我又覺得我這一點因走路不便的犧牲的微小了。</p>
<p>我望着火，望着將雨未雨的滿空的白雲，我希望下雨，讓那些飯攤暫時喪失了他們的生意，讓我得到一些走路不便，而被我覺得苦惱後的喜悅吧！</p>
<p>但在燈紅酒綠中生活着的富公子，貴小姐們是覺不到那些的。</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第二章　「一頁往史！」</p>
<p>霍桑緩緩問道：「你什麽時候知道伊在幹跳舞的事？」</p>
<p>那老頭兒想了一想，說道：「在前年的秋天，伊寫信到鄉間去，又寄給我五十塊錢，叫我到上海來玩一趟。我到了這裏，才知伊一到上海，並沒有進什麽工廠，就跟着招弟學跳舞的。招弟本來也是在當舞女，做工的話，完全是騙騙我們鄉下人。那時候麗蘭剛交二十歲，被選了什麽舞國皇后，上海的一班輕薄少年都發瘋似地捧伊。伊高興得了不得，因此特地叫我到上海來玩。」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「你從那時一直到現在嗎？」</p>
<p>李芝範搖搖頭·「不，我過不慣這樣的生活——也許我沒有福氣。住了十天光景，我就回鄉下去。這一次伊又帶信叫我到上海來，我還是十一那天到的，到今天已有八天。這裏的房子比以前寬大多了，伊的塲面也闊綽得多，可是我總過不慣。我本來打算再過兩三天就要回鄉下去，誰想到昨夜裏會鬧出這一件事來。」</p>
<p>霍桑點着頭，尋思了一下，說道：「現在請你把昨夜的事說一說。」</p>
<p>李芝範道：「我也不大明白。昨夜麗蘭是在外面吃夜飯的——其實這一次我到了這裏八天，祇有一次伊在家裏陪我一塊兒吃夜飯。我一個人吃過了夜飯，在這室中看了一張報，又把那些圖畫書翻了一翻，到了十點鍾光景，天下雨了，我就上樓去睡，——唉，我的煙嘴還忘記在這裏呢。」　　（二十）</p>
<h3>人生　人生的真義</h3>
<p>— 張俊</p>
<p>有許多靑年常常這樣說：「我們實在生不逢辰，如果生得早，國家也許比較太平，我們可以安享日出而作日入而息的太平福；生得遲，國家也許建國業已完成，我們可以安享民治民有民享的三民福·一然而，靑年們；福也許是享到了，可是人生的真義也同時减少了。」</p>
<p>人生的真義是什麽？簡單的說，便是「創造」和「奮鬥」。一切享福的環境，最足减少創造的能力和奮鬥的情緒。在一種平凡無奇的環境中，也做不出什麽驚天動地可歌可泣的事業來，空過一生，有何真義？</p>
<p>人生最感覺煩悶的，就是無事可做；或者有事做，而太平凡，太沒有價值。愛數學的人就明白了，整天地演習着熟習的已經了解的問題，你一定感覺乏味；假使突然遇着一個繁雜的問題，經過了苦思才解答出來，你一定很高興很快活。目前的世界，正擺着許許多多的題目等待解决，只怕你缺乏了能力，不怕欠缺了問題，而且這些問題都是很有真義很有價值的，除了在這種空間和時間，還能找着嗎？英雄有用武之地，難道不是現代靑年獨享的幸福嗎？</p>
<p>幸運的現代靑年們！莫辜負了千載難逢的機遇，抓着了空間時間，把整個的世界，重新改造，做一個現代的靑年！革命的靑年！戰鬥的靑年！</p>

<h3>唐門三傑素描</h3>
<p>— 阿漢</p>
<p>在我國話劇史上，中國旅行劇團確是具有很多功績的。中旅唐門三傑槐秋若青若英，擁有最多數的觀眾。這裏對於他們父女三人約略作個素描：</p>
<p>唐槐秋從事戲劇工作的態度，嚴肅又是忠實的。最近「孔夫子」一片的主演足够證明。從前他在故鄉湖南，與他父親滌心先生一同工作時候，曾利用業餘時間，編過　紙副刊，寫過散文小品，所以也是一位文學作家呢！他早歲曾留法研究航空，但回國後却幹着戲劇運動。今年已經四十三歲，說話的語氣顯是蒼老一些，身材和面形都很削長的。牠和他夫人和兩位女兒中間，往往以幽默的動態展開天倫的樂趣，譬如他要與她女兒說話，並不當面就談，而是寫在一張紙上，下署「爸爸」兩字，但看這事，就十分風趣了。最近，他們父女三人，共同合演「雷雨」，事先若青臨時參加，因此賣座打破璇宮歷來的記錄，他慨嘆着說：「我老了，不中用了，我的觀眾都被若青拉來了！」其實他的內心，正充滿着不可言喻的愉快呢！</p>
<p>唐若青……她從香港歸來，就說：「安逸的生活把我身體弄得更胖了！」可知她是一個具有健康美的新女性，她的個性，熱情和豪爽交織着的，無論識與不識者，在她的態度永遠使人發生美的印象。她說：「除了讀者看報，別無他種嗜好，但要一定提出一種來，那或許是「义义小麻將」了。」但是，他的舞台藝術果然舞台藝術果然無人可與並肩，麻將本領却很幼稚，往往會摸上十八隻牌的。這在她自己，也是認爲唯一的笑話。</p>
<p>唐若英……天真活潑，可以形容着她全部性情。現在她在震旦大學文學陸軍讀書，課餘，常以客串姿態演出，「雷雨」是演四鳳，那是極合個性的。她在家裏，養着許多小狗小貓小雞小鴨，並且種植瓜果等等東西。她說：「她的知已伴侶，就是這些小動物和小植物了。」</p>
<h3>皇宮大戲院　將改米高梅舞廳</h3>
<p>— 稜白</p>
<p>本年開幕的皇宮大戲劇，因爲奎德社演出失敗，所以一度計劃改建電影院，放映第二輪國產影片，後來却因執照發生問題，衹得作爲罷論。同時出租與福祿壽公司，由該公司出面，演唱文濱劇團的申曲，如今，文濱劇團將於本月三十日期滿，記者據可靠方面報道，探得該院今後的趨向。</p>
<p>皇宮主幹者是何五良鄭煒顯兩君，鄭君則是大新舞廳的經理，大新月租三千元，最近却要增加三千五百元，共爲六千五百元，於是鄭君同何君會商下來，決定放棄大新，將皇宮改造舞廳，並且定名米高梅，預定七月初旬開工，十月一日工幕。</p>
<p>本來，皇宮原址是新世界的跑驢塲，而將跑驢塲遷於南邊，如今米高梅爲擴充地盤起見，決將南邊的跑驢塲再行取消，一齊劃入米高梅的思綫中，好在鄭君也是新世界的經理，所以並無問題的。</p>
<h3>競揶民間電影　一終非影界之福</h3>

<p>此半月中，備公司爲競攝民間故事影片，空氣頓見十分緊張，蓋此爲中國電影界之一大劇變，亦不妨謂爲十五年前中國電影史之重演，其於電影文化之影響未可漠視耳。記者特爲此事走訪目下息影中之某電影文化界要人，詢以意見，某電影坦白而答曰：「在批評競攝民間電影之前，我以爲先要答復一個問題：是製片公司是否有存在於今日的上海的必要，倘若在於今日的上海的必要，倘若說是有必要的話，中央就該派員直接指導，不然，聽其自生自減，雖保沒有這種現象發生。這不但電影企業，舉凡作爲商業的組合，都有這種可能的。」旋談到各公司競攝民間故事時，某君答曰：「我以爲即使目下的環境不佳，但無論如何制製作的路綫不會如此狹小，不走此路，未見得沒有其他的路可走，可是製作家競走此路，當然有他伯的理由的：或是爲了製作上的便利，或是爲了易於號召觀眾，倘使這兩種理由高於一切，我們也就無話可說了。」</p>

<h3>Germany and Italy Accept Armistice, Presenting Moderate Terms to France, France Sends Plenipotentiary Representatives to Prepare for Negotiations, Content Too Harsh, Unacceptable to France</h3>
<p>London: French radio claims that the French cabinet met at 9:00 AM to discuss Germany's reply to France's request for an armistice. At 11:30 AM, French radio announced that the French cabinet had appointed plenipotentiary representatives for armistice negotiations. However, the French army is continuing its resistance.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued after the meeting, the cabinet convened at 9:00 AM under the chairmanship of President Lebrun to consider the German government's note transmitted by the Spanish ambassador. The German government stated in the note that it was prepared to notify the French government of the conditions for ceasing hostilities after the names of the French plenipotentiary representatives were submitted. The German government will announce the date and location for receiving these plenipotentiary representatives. The cabinet has already appointed the plenipotentiary representatives. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>New York: According to reliable sources from a Madrid correspondent of the "New York Times," the Axis powers' terms for peace were delivered to the Spanish Ambassador to France, Lequerica, last night. The ambassador is currently with the French government in Bordeaux. It is said that the terms are very harsh. The correspondent learned that the surrender of the French fleet is one of them. The correspondent also stated that, according to Madrid sources, almost all of the French naval forces sailed away from French ports yesterday. Spanish newspapers also vaguely mentioned seeing French planes flying towards Africa, presumably to avoid falling into the hands of the German army. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Munich: German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini concluded a historic meeting here last night. Also present were German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht Keitel, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, Chief of Staff Roatta, and Schmidt, a well-known interpreter from the German Foreign Office, serving as translator. After the meeting, a public statement was issued, saying, "The German Führer and the Italian Prime Minister have agreed on the attitude of both countries towards France's request for an armistice." The meeting lasted for 8 hours and 10 minutes and ended at 8:10 PM last night. Crowds waited outside the meeting hall for the end of the meeting. When Mussolini and Hitler left the Charles Palace, the crowds sang and cheered. Hitler accompanied Mussolini to the station. After Mussolini's special train left the station, Hitler also left Munich for another destination. Both destinations have yet to be announced. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Munich: While Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini were talking in the study of Hitler's residence, their entourage also held discussions in another reception room. Attendees included Buti, Director of the Mediterranean Department of the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Vitetti, Director of the Central European Department; Chief of Staff Roatta; Admiral Guagnot of the Navy; General Pellino of the Air Force; and Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Wehrmacht; Bodenschatz, Director-General of the Air Ministry; Dietrich, Head of the Intelligence Department; Gaus, Director of the Legal Department of the Foreign Office; and Doehnberg, Director of the Protocol Department. Also present were the German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, and the Italian Ambassador to Germany, Alfieri. The content was said to be extremely confidential. (Haitong Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Italian Newspaper Reveals Content of Terms</p>
<p>Rome: According to the Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia," the terms of peace presented by Germany and Italy to France regarding economic and industrial reparations are very harsh. The newspaper's special correspondent in Munich learned the results of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini. It is said that these peace terms include territorial compensation and the following: (1) Transfer of France's gold and foreign deposits to the Axis powers; (2) Transfer of all gold and deposits held in France by countries at war with Germany, such as England, Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium, to the Axis powers; (3) Delivery of all military infrastructure materials, gasoline, copper, and manganese in France to the Axis powers; (4) France should guarantee the restoration of peacetime industrial conditions and order the return of evacuated workers to their original industrial centers; (5) Guarantee that all French industrial, economic, commercial, and financial facilities should be used to blockade England. According to Berlin sources, German authorities have neither confirmed nor denied the news reported by the Italian newspaper, but believe that the Italian newspaper should not have published these peace terms. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The entire German people are focused on the Munich meeting. The opinions of political figures can be represented by the "Stürmer," which stated: "Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini are both striving to maintain peace, which is a common belief of the German and Italian people. Currently, the leaders of Germany and Italy are laying a permanent foundation for European peace. France now wants to avoid sacrificing more lives and shedding more blood and should not resist the inevitable. But more blood must be shed now, and the various disputes created by the financial oligarchy in Europe must be resolved. Therefore, what Germany cares most about is the permanent peace of Europe. We have not forgotten the experience we gained in November 1918, and the shackles imposed on us by the Treaty of Versailles. As for the terms of this armistice, France should accept the conditions we have proposed." (Haitong News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Germany Unwilling to Ceasefire Before Terms are Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Bordeaux: A French semi-official news agency pointed out that the communiqué released by Germany today did not contain the terms of the French armistice. It also said that hostilities could only end after these terms were agreed upon. These terms will now be returned to the French plenipotentiary representatives and may take days to agree upon before the ceasefire is implemented. It is feared that before the "ceasefire" is implemented, a larger part of French territory will be occupied by the German army. The German army is now vigorously advancing towards the southeast, which indicates that the German army intends to contact the Italian army before both sides implement a ceasefire. It is also heard that France has not yet received a reply to the official document sent to the Italian government through the Spanish ambassador. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>French Generals in England Advocate Resistance to the End</p>
<p>London: French General de Gaulle, who served as Undersecretary of National Defense in the Reynaud cabinet, delivered a broadcast speech here on behalf of the French generals currently in England, advocating continued resistance. He stated, "The enemy's mechanical strength in both land and air is indeed superior to ours. It has been so in the past, and it is still so now. One of the reasons for our army's retreat is the larger number of German troops. However, their superior tanks, aircraft, and strategies are the main reasons. However, can this situation necessarily become a fixed and unchangeable state? Has all hope truly vanished and ceased to exist? Is our army so defeated that it cannot recover? All these questions can be answered with 'No.' I make this judgment based on what I know. Please do not doubt it. I dare to announce to the world that France has not given up hope. The manner in which it is currently experiencing setbacks has great potential to lead to victory in the future. Truly, France is not isolated. It has a vast colonial empire behind it, and it can unite with the British Empire, which controls the oceans and continues to fight. It can also fully utilize the vast resources of American industry. This war cannot be limited to the unfortunate territory of our country. How it ends is not determined by the outcome of the 'Battle of France.' In short, this war is a world war. Although we have made repeated mistakes and suffered deeply, there are various ways in the universe that can enable us to defeat the enemy one day. At this moment, although we are dispersed by mechanical forces, in the future we can still use even more powerful mechanical forces to conquer everything. It must be known that how the fate of the entire world evolves depends on this one move. Therefore, I dare to urge French officers, soldiers, technicians, and skilled workers who are currently in England or are about to come to England to return to me. No matter what changes happen in the future, the flame of French resistance must not be allowed to be extinguished and will never be extinguished." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Before the French Armistice Agreement is Signed, the French Army is Ordered to Continue Fighting</p>
<p>Bordeaux: Premier Pétain and General Weygand, Chief of National Defense, jointly issued a public statement stating, "The government has received reports that the German army is currently misusing the white flag, attempting to gain a great advance without fighting. Therefore, it is solemnly notified to the land, sea, and air forces of our country and the allied countries that since the armistice agreement has not been concluded and hostile actions have not ceased, although we intend to conduct peace talks, in reality they have not yet begun. Therefore, our duty remains to continue fighting." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>German Mechanized Units Advance on Three Routes, Eastern Route Approaches Italian-Swiss Border</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command announced that while Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini were discussing France's surrender in Munich, German mechanized units continued to pursue the French army retreating towards the Atlantic yesterday. Currently, the German army's operations are divided into three routes of rapid advance: (1) Advancing from Normandy towards Brittany in the west; (2) Advancing southeast along the Loire River, with the apparent aim of joining the Italian army in Savoy; (3) Attempting to break through the Maginot Line and various fortresses in eastern France. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux: A Havas correspondent recently telegraphed from the front lines that the French army is divided into four isolated groups, with large gaps between their positions. They are currently continuing to resist, although the soldiers are extremely tired and the situation is quite critical, but they are still fighting bravely. The positions of each group from west to east are as follows: (1) The army downstream of the Seine River, which was originally fighting south of Évreux, has now been deployed to the Avranches heights. The enemy forces in that area are attacking the city of Anjou to the south on the right flank. (2) Along the Loire River, our army is fighting in Brouage, Orléans, and La Charité. The enemy has suffered heavy losses but is still attempting to cross the Loire River. To the east, enemy units have crossed the gap and divided into two routes, with the western route heading towards Nevers and the eastern route heading towards Dijon, Chalon, and the Swiss border. No reports have been received regarding the progress of enemy forces in that area. (3) The easternmost units of our army are very complete and are currently engaged in maneuvers, but the details are being kept secret. (4) Our army in the foothills of the Alps is threatened by enemy forces in the Saône River basin and has taken the necessary steps to defend itself properly. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>Bordeaux: The French General Headquarters recently released a battle report stating, "After the enemy launched a fierce attack on Normandy and Brittany today, they have made progress, but both sides are still engaged in fierce fighting south of Château-Thierry. In addition, the enemy has established multiple bridgeheads in the middle reaches of the Loire River, between Orléans and Nevers. Those between the Loire River and the Vosges Mountains are continuing to advance towards the Jura Mountains (i.e., the Maginot Line area). However, the French army in the provinces of Ain and Jura is still fighting hard against the enemy, preventing them from succeeding." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>German Military Report</h3>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters: This afternoon, the German military report stated that German troops occupied Cherbourg and La Haye-du-Puits, advancing rapidly towards Lyon. West of Mülhausen, tank and mechanized units from Gelford will connect with German troops who have crossed the upper reaches of the Rhine River. Further north, German troops occupied Nancy. On the Maginot Line, enemy troops continued to resist on both sides of Diedenhofen. German fighter planes and dive bombers are still cooperating with infantry to destroy the obstinate French troops trapped in Lorraine, bombing their fortresses and troop strongholds. Not far from Cherbourg, a merchant ship (10,000 tons) was sunk by bombs. German planes flew to England again, bombing airfields and oil depots, with the oil catching fire and burning. Last night, British planes bombed northern and western Germany, killing eighteen people. Yesterday, enemy planes lost a total of six aircraft, and five German planes were missing. (Haitong Press, 19th)</p>
<h3>German Planes Launch Large-Scale Attacks on England, Ten Eastern Counties Bombed, Most Intense Since Beginning of War, British Statement Claims Seven German Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>London: A joint statement from the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security stated that enemy planes attacked various districts in eastern England last night, dropping bombs. Air raid alerts were issued immediately. Four hours later, seven enemy planes were shot down. Bombs were dropped in various districts of eastern Lincolnshire and Yorkshire, killing eleven civilians and injuring fourteen. At least four children, including two infants, were among the civilians who lost their lives today. Most of the civilians injured or killed were in a row of houses that were hit. However, military targets did not suffer significant damage. Two German planes caught fire and crashed after being intercepted by British fighter planes off the east coast. Another German plane was shot down off the coast of Norfolk. Subsequently, another German plane was shot down in Kent. An air raid alert was issued on the coast of Yorkshire at midnight. One hour later, five groups of aircraft were sighted, believed to be enemy bombers flying from the east. An air raid alert was also issued at the mouth of the Thames River, lasting for one and a half hours. A town in the area was hit, injuring five people and killing two, including an old woman who died of heart failure. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>London: Only a few hours after the British Prime Minister warned the British people that German planes would launch a large-scale air raid on England, the Nazi iron birds, as powerful as rushing waves, flew over the east coast of England last night and this morning and reached the British skies. Ten counties were bombed. According to official sources, the casualties were heaviest in the coastal ports of the east. The bombs dropped by the German planes all landed in densely populated areas and areas with many houses. It is said that the material damage was still minor, as the most significant damage was to private residences and farmhouses. According to explanations from military officials, the number of bombs dropped in this German air raid was not very large, and it is feared that it was still for reconnaissance purposes. The air raid began after 11:00 PM last night. Air raid alerts were issued in Kent, Essex, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Yorkshire, and Rutland. Residents of each county rushed to take refuge upon hearing the alert. This air raid alert was the longest since the beginning of the war, lasting for three and a half hours. A bomb fell in the garden of a town in East Dulwich. The glass windows and roofs of the houses in the garden were destroyed. Two people were killed and five injured in a town near East Dulwich. Among the seven or eight German planes shot down, there was a large bomber. It was reported that the plane was destroyed by Spitfires and crashed on the southeast coast. The aviators in the plane attempted to escape but failed, and all died. Observers believe that the Nazis bombed only thirty-six hours before the House of Commons was scheduled to hold a secret meeting to listen to Prime Minister Churchill and War Secretary Eden report on preparations to cope with the expected air raid, which has great significance. British military officials, while speculating on when Hitler would openly launch his blitzkrieg tactics against England, said that Britain might get a short rest when Germany finishes the war in France and reorganizes its troops to prepare for a new attack. The "Evening Standard" also believes that there may be a month of respite before Germany confronts England with all its strength. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<h3>French侨 (Overseas Chinese) in Hong Kong Oppose Surrender</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: The stationed French consul telegraphed that French residing in Hong Kong all hope to continue the war and would rather lose the capital than surrender. This failure was due to an underestimation of Germany's strength. (18th)</p>

<h3>An Awaited Question</h3>
<p>Every minute, every minute, we await better or worse news; hoping to discern clues as to how the future will be decided and evolve; hoping to cope with the frustration that has been woven together by multiple parties in recent tens of hours. But we are still in the midst of waiting. The Munich telegram only stated that the German Führer and the Italian Prime Minister had agreed on the attitude of the two governments towards France's request for an armistice, and did not mention the content of the attitude. Such a brief and unclear message is certainly not enough to satisfy the world's expectations.</p>
<p>There is no page in history like this, where the depth and universality of human frustration can be compared to the present. The sky is dark, the shadows are flickering, and the sounds are murmuring. The next scene, which is inextricably linked to the pain of all mankind, is about to be revealed, but no one can predict what the next scene will be. What is vaguely audible is: First, the French authorities stated that what they are seeking is not a humiliating surrender, but an honorable cessation of hostilities; but how to be considered honorable is, of course, temporarily impossible to interpret. In addition, French General de Gaulle in London, England, called on the French military and civilians to go and join him; under this call, of course, everyone pays attention to the naval and air generals who still retain the greatest freedom of action. Second, the British authorities declared their continued fighting and everything is very active: especially its active nature is seen in the British Canadian Prime Minister's report that the Canadian Expeditionary Force landed and fortified in Danish Iceland, and is also managing the French territories in the Western Hemisphere. But in every sense, the diagnosis of the British attitude must wait until the German-French armistice agreement is established before it can be considered accurate. Third, the German government and the public are avoiding revealing any opinions on this change, so it is unfathomable; but the "Stürmer" argues that the common aspirations of the leaders of Germany and Italy and the common beliefs of the people are to strive to maintain peace and lay a permanent foundation for European peace; thus, the German state-run Haitong News Agency pointed out that this can represent the views of German political figures. Fourth, liquidation, revenge, severity, such calls are prevalent in Berlin, the German capital, and Rome, the Italian capital; it seems that the Roman side is particularly high. Fifth, US Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark suddenly recommended to Congress to build 200 more warships, costing 4 billion US dollars; after completion, the quantity will be greater than the sum of the British and Japanese navies. Sixth, maritime transport between Hong Kong and the French coastal defense has been announced to be suspended: according to private speculation, it is not that the Chinese South China Sea has already been affected by the aftershocks of the European War, but because the British Eastern Fleet is committed to strengthening the defenses of Hong Kong and Singapore, and has no time to escort convoys, so as not to disperse its forces.</p>
<p>From these extremely vague clues, although they are definitely not comparable to castles in the air, nor are they mere rumors, yet based on these alone, it is absolutely not enough to glimpse how the future of the world will tend. The changes in the world are confusing, and the future is vague; except for bold and irresponsible prophets, there is really no way to talk about it at present. Even at present, to provide clues, the first is to quietly observe what questions Mr. Hitler and Mr. Mussolini will ask to France, or at different times to Britain and France. If we see the questions, we may be able to see a little bit of the trend from the side. Second, we must carefully examine what the contents are of the examination papers that are handed in by France or Britain and France. After seeing the contents, we may be able to infer a few percentages of success or failure from the side. Without seeing the questions, we can only be frustrated! In the midst of frustration, we can't help but fantasize: Is the establishment of a permanent foundation for European peace in the minds of German political figures necessarily the same as the interpretations added to Nazi and Fascist classics by British, American, and French propagandists and political commentators in recent years? Is it possible that such interpretations are completely malicious distortions? Could it be that the true meaning of the permanent foundation of peace in the minds of German political figures is indeed outstanding and surpasses the theory of the Treaty of Versailles, and is actually no different from the Confucian concept of the Kingly Way? Could it be that the conditions presented by Germany and Italy to Britain and France have abandoned the attitude of liquidation, rejected the idea of revenge, and do not take severity but still value forgiveness; making honest people in Britain and France smile through their tears? Making world public opinion unanimous? How can this not all be fantasy? But since a permanent foundation of peace is sought by both the government and the public in Germany and Italy, then mankind should have room to establish normal and common theories, and mankind should not despair of light. If victory or defeat is the standard for everything, if building warships is an unavoidable method, then it will inevitably be denied by common sense as the foundation for a permanent foundation of peace. If a permanent foundation of peace cannot be laid, then even if this war ends in victory, it is only preparing for the start of the next war.</p>

<p>B. Speech: Chairman, comrades, taking advantage of the opportunity of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Memorial Week today, I would like to report to you on the recent international situation and the Sino-Japanese war. On the international front, Paris was occupied by the German army last week. Since the start of the European war last September until last week when the French army withdrew from Paris, one can say that this is how the European war is developing. Although it is not possible to make a definitive judgment now, one thing can be affirmed: no matter how the European war changes, it is constantly evolving in a direction that is beneficial to our Chinese war of resistance. Especially in recent weeks, the tension in the European war has allowed the U.S. military expansion plan to be passed in its Congress. At the same time, the embargo issue has also begun to be implemented. These two things, whether directly or indirectly, have a greater impact on our Chinese war of resistance. I explained this principle in detail at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang last year. Looking back now, our past arduous struggle, in less than a year and a half, this ideal has been fully realized. From this, we can be more confident that the goal of our war of resistance, as long as we can follow our consistent war of resistance strategy and tactics, and advance step by step, we will surely achieve final victory. Therefore, the passage of the U.S. military expansion and embargo bills can be said to have already determined the future of East Asia and the final victory of our war of resistance. This explains the relationship between the European war and China's war of resistance. As for how the European war will develop in the future, I dare not say now. But no matter how the European war situation evolves, it will only benefit China's war of resistance and will not harm it. This can be said with certainty. Secondly, I want to talk about the recent situation of the Sino-Japanese war. From the first of last month to the fifteenth of this month, the Japanese's only goal was to imitate the German blitzkrieg style, wanting to resolve the Sino-Japanese war with extremely rapid means. At that time, we saw Japanese newspapers, almost the entire country unanimously demanded a quick way to end the Sino-Japanese war in order to liberate him from the shackles of pain. And the general public in our country inevitably thought that the Japanese might seek a solution politically or economically. But I have long affirmed that, now, the Japanese, other than trying to make a last-ditch effort in military affairs, cannot have other ideas. Therefore, for the past two months, the Japanese have been trying their best to attack militarily, wanting to end the Sino-Japanese war with a military victory. Especially since Germany used blitzkrieg tactics to attack the Netherlands and Belgium, the Japanese were particularly restless, thinking that Germany could use blitzkrieg to win completely in the Netherlands and Belgium, and why couldn't they use blitzkrieg to seek victory in China? So he also copied the old trick of Germany attacking the Netherlands and Belgium, wanting to defeat our Chinese army. Therefore, since the Japanese launched this offensive, I saw early on that the Japanese would definitely transfer troops from other battlefields, using all their strength to try to win. Sure enough, since the first of last month, the Japanese have concentrated a large number of air force and tanks in the Xianghua Road area, with the intention of first defeating our troops in northern Hubei. If our field strength were eliminated, the war in the Fifth War Area could be resolved first. We discovered this Japanese plot, so we automatically moved the field troops in that area to other areas. At that time, the Japanese army advanced to the Suizao area but could not find the location of our main field army. Until they advanced to the vicinity of Tanghe and Xinye, they still gained nothing. And our field troops suddenly advanced to the side and rear of the Japanese army at this time, cutting off the only rear transportation line, Lihua Road, and fiercely attacking the Japanese army from the side, forcing them to retreat south in a panic. At the same time, General Commander Zhang Zizhong's troops in eastern Xianghe were deploying positions on the south side of the Japanese army, preparing to deal a head-on blow. Under this situation, the Japanese could not but fight like cornered beasts, so they concentrated their planes and tanks and rushed south. General Zhang ordered his troops, with their disparate numbers, to naturally suffer considerable setbacks. The Japanese, on the one hand, saw that General Zhang's troops had suffered setbacks, and on the other hand, the attack on northern Hubei had backfired. Our General Headquarters had long anticipated that they would definitely take advantage of the reduction in our forces in western Xiangxi and take a chance. As for us, a part of the forces defending the Yangtze River and the Yellow River had been increased, so the remaining troops should not be stationed on the shore. Therefore, we first withdrew the main forces defending the Yangtze River and the Yellow River to the mountainous areas north of Yichang, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Later, the Japanese army did not disappoint us and attacked Yichang from the first of this month to the day before yesterday. Our troops in Yichang only had a small force, luring him into Yichang, while our main force automatically withdrew to the mountains around Yichang at that time. Now, although our Yichang streets have been abandoned, what is the real situation in Yichang? Today I can tell you, everyone, that our troops are still around Yichang, as close as 500 meters and as far as three or four kilometers. Therefore, our troops are still guarding the positions in the suburbs of Yichang. In fact, Yichang is still controlled by our troops, and our main force is actively adopting an encirclement around the Japanese army. I believe that this time, we will definitely be able to completely annihilate the Japanese troops in Xiangxi. The Japanese army is still unaware of this situation and instead exaggerates its propaganda as much as possible, claiming that its blitzkrieg tactics have been successful, and that its army is stronger than the German army and advancing faster than the German army, as if no country in the world can be its enemy. But they do not know that the clumsiness of their strategies and tactics is really not worth a knowledgeable person's smile. Everyone knows that the so-called blitzkrieg not only requires various well-equipped tanks and elite air force, but also various scientific organizations and technologies, and also requires good traffic roads in the combat zone. Only when the right time, place, and people cooperate with each other can results be achieved. But where do the Japanese have such conditions for combat now? He compares himself to Germany, which is even more of a (Dong Shi imitates Xi Shi)'s act. With Japan's industry and weapons and equipment, he wants to compare himself to Germany, and wants to imitate Germany's blitzkrieg tactics to advance deeply in order to end the war of aggression against China. How can he not be trapped by his own actions and be killed? What's more, how can the terrain and transportation in western Hubei and this battlefield carry out blitzkrieg? Therefore, the Japanese's so-called blitzkrieg is really no different from a fool's dream. However, on the other hand, we have a very effective tactic to attract, trap, and suffocate the Japanese for this kind of stupid political offense. No matter how he acts, we can control his life, especially when he goes deep and rushes forward, so that he meets our tactical conditions. I can tell you clearly and publicly now that our only tactic for fighting the Japanese is the magnetic tactic, which is like a magnet attracting iron, making him closer and closer, tighter and tighter, unable to retreat, unable to advance, and unable to escape our control. Finally, he falls into a desperate situation where he cannot advance or retreat. Therefore, the Japanese army is now not only unable to use blitzkrieg, but even if the Japanese can meet the conditions for combat and implement his blitzkrieg, it will eventually be overcome by our (magnetic tactic). We are now not worried that Yichang cannot be recovered, but that the Japanese army is unwilling to fight in Xiangxi. If so, our (magnetic tactic)'s annihilation strategy will be fully realized in the shortest period of time. In short, we use our true magnetic tactics to deal with the Japanese blitzkrieg tactics, and we use the national spirit of our military and civilians being willing to be jade fragments rather than broken tiles to deal with the Japanese army's exhausted, boring, and blindly bombing policies. We will not only make all the forces used by the Japanese army into a pillar to play the zither, but also make him hit the wall everywhere, be empty all the time, and be no different from lifting a spear to attack the air. Our predetermined political and military strategy cannot fail to achieve final success. The above is an explanation of the Sino-Japanese war situation in the past two months and our use of magnetic tactics to attack the Japanese army, so that they cannot escape our control.

<h3>U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Proposes Building 200 New Warships: Unprecedented Expansion Program Submitted to Congress: Organizing Two Ocean Fleets to Defend the Western Hemisphere</h3>
<p>Washington: U.S. Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark requested Congress yesterday to increase the naval strength by 70%, effectively doubling the current fleet strength. The required funding is US$4,000,000,000. Admiral Stark declared that the increase would make the U.S. Navy the largest in the world, larger than the combined British and Japanese fleets. Given the current world situation and the need to defend the Western Hemisphere and the Monroe Doctrine, it is necessary to organize a great fleet. When Admiral Stark proposed increasing naval strength by 70%, the House Naval Affairs Committee was considering increasing naval tonnage by 23%. Admiral Stark's proposal includes the Vinson Act, which provides for the addition of 84 new warships. President Roosevelt signed a bill on Monday to increase naval tonnage by 11%. The President supports the Vinson Act, which increases naval strength by 23%. (On Monday, the House of Representatives unanimously passed a bill to increase the U.S. Army's strength to 400,000 men. This increase is three times the number of U.S. Army personnel in 1939, making the U.S. Army the largest since 1919. (Nineteenth United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Canadian Expeditionary Force Lands in Iceland: Extending Defensive Power to French Territories in the Western Hemisphere: Thousands of Young People Recruited into Air Force Service: South African Prime Minister Declares Support for Britain</h3>

Although it does not mention any country, members of Congress are obviously referring to Germany. (Nineteenth Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chaotic Situation in Japanese Concessions; Further Designs on Vietnam; France and Japan Obstruct the Transportation of Munitions Through Vietnam; Indefinite Suspension of Ship Traffic Between Hong Kong and Vietnam</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Chinese circles are greatly disturbed by recent Japanese broadcasts that criticize French Indochina for allowing weapons, munitions, gasoline, and trucks to pass through its territory into China. General opinion holds that Japan is taking advantage of the internal disorder in France to seize Vietnam. The recent large-scale concentration of Japanese troops on Hainan Island and Nanning seems to confirm these suspicions. Well-informed sources believe that Japanese forces may attempt to occupy Vietnam via Nanning, supported by naval forces off the Vietnamese coast. The French forces in Vietnam are clearly insufficient to deal with such an event. Public opinion believes that the fate of Vietnam will depend on the attitude of Britain and the United States, especially the latter. Yesterday, the National Government held a meeting to discuss the latest developments in the European situation. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reliable sources, the transshipment of gasoline and oils to inland China via Indochina will soon be halted. This action is said to be in response to a Japanese demand. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Norwegian ship "Mimosa" and the British ship "Elizabeth" were scheduled to sail to Vietnam yesterday, but could not depart because the authorities in charge of customs clearance refused to issue the necessary documents. It is rumored that the issuance of customs clearance for all ships wishing to sail to Vietnam is currently under consideration. At the same time, British and Allied ships at sea have been ordered not to sail to French ports. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Cabinet met yesterday to discuss the European war situation. It is believed that the future of Vietnam was also discussed. According to semi-official Japanese sources, diplomatic observers feel that Japan is as concerned about maintaining the status quo in French Indochina as it is about maintaining the status quo in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, these observers expect the Japanese government to take diplomatic steps to achieve this goal, especially since Vietnam has now become an important route for the Chongqing government to transport remaining war materials. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: News from here today indicates that all ships sailing from Hong Kong to French Indochina have been suspended indefinitely. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: When the spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry met with reporters today, some inquired about a report in yesterday's Yomiuri Shimbun that the Japanese government had decided to ask Germany and Italy to fully respect Japan's position in East Asia, especially regarding French Indochina. The spokesman replied that he could not comment on this matter. He also stated that the Japanese government is paying serious attention to the Vietnam issue for strategic reasons. The Sino-Japanese war has now reached its final or most important stage, and Vietnam has become the only important route for the Chongqing government to import arms and supplies. Therefore, Japan is now focusing its efforts on eliminating this route. Japan, as a strong nation maintaining stability in East Asia, was clearly stated in the initial Anglo-Japanese Alliance diplomatic documents. When asked about an Associated Press report from Rome that Hitler and Mussolini might demand that France cede Vietnam to Japan, the spokesman replied that he regarded this only as newspaper news. As for the report that Britain, France, and the United States may be negotiating joint administration of Vietnam, he had not received any official information and therefore believed that such an event would not occur. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government today again protested to France about the transshipment of military supplies to Chongqing through Vietnam. Masayuki Tani, the Japanese Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, recently summoned French Ambassador to Japan Arsène-Henry to the Foreign Ministry and presented him with a letter of protest. It is reported that the French Ambassador replied to Tani Masayuki that France is automatically taking appropriate measures in Vietnam to prevent military supplies from passing through Vietnam to Chongqing. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Yomiuri Shimbun, a newspaper here with close ties to military circles, warned Indochina when Japan protested to France about Indochina's aid to Chongqing, saying that if Japan's protest did not produce concrete results, Japanese troops would be forced to take military measures to stop such aid. The newspaper claimed that today's protest was a final warning, and that if Indochina, after receiving this protest, still failed to stop the supply of military materials to the Chongqing government, Japanese troops would naturally take the necessary measures to completely cut off this military transport. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Mr. Suma, stated that due to the surrender of the French army to Germany, Japan, for the sake of security in the Far East, could not but be concerned about Indochina. Not only did Japan rely on the tin, rice, and coal produced there, but the Japanese government was also paying close attention to the transshipment of military supplies through the region to inland China and was considering ways to prevent it. Suma refused to comment on reports in the Japanese press that the Japanese government was planning to explain Japan's position to the German and Italian governments, explaining that Japan was a country responsible for maintaining stability in the Far East. According to Japanese newspapers, the Japanese government will notify Germany and Italy that Japan wants to maintain the status quo in Indochina and cannot ignore any changes in the political status of Indochina and the Dutch East Indies.

<h3>Japan Seeks to Strengthen Ties with Germany and Italy; Announced by Rome Radio</h3>
<p>Rome: Yesterday, Rome Radio reported that as a result of France's surrender, the connection between Japan and the Axis powers has become closer. According to news from Tokyo, the political trend advocating closer ties between Japan, Germany, and Italy has been intensified by events in recent days. A close alliance between Japan and the German-Italian axis may be possible. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>

<h3>Britain Prepares for a Long War; Confident of Ultimate Victory; Churchill Reports on the War Situation in the House of Commons; British Naval and Air Power Hold Absolute Superiority</h3>
<p>London: Prime Minister Churchill, yesterday, in the House of Commons, when recounting the details of the sensational events of the previous few days, declared amidst cheers that Britain and the British Empire would continue to fight, even if it meant enduring for several years and standing alone. Mr. Churchill announced the British Empire's determination to continue the struggle and stated that all the Dominions were prepared to join the war until final victory. After detailing the safe evacuation of approximately 350,000 British troops, representing seven-eighths of the total British forces sent to France, along with a large amount of equipment, Mr. Churchill further detailed the government's efforts to prepare for a possible German invasion. He stated that, at present, there were a total of 1.25 million soldiers under arms, in addition to 500,000 local volunteer defense corps. This force would continue to grow, and troops from the Dominions would also participate in protecting the homeland.</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill continued by explaining the difficulties that German invading forces would encounter. Britain's strong internal defenses would require an overwhelmingly large invading force, supported by powerful naval vessels. At this point, Mr. Churchill reminded the audience that, "In short, we still have the Navy. The Navy's duty is to annihilate any large-scale maritime expeditionary force before it reaches the coast, or as it is approaching. The entire coastline is protected by extensive minefields. The Admiralty has begun to take steps to counter any new weapons that the Germans may invent. "Speaking about air power, Mr. Churchill said that, although the British Air Force was smaller in number than the German Air Force, it was a powerful tool, and its pilots and aircraft had proven their superior quality in numerous battles. Although the German forces had been victorious in Holland, Belgium, and France, all of the government's expert advisors agreed that Britain should continue to fight and had good and reasonable hope of ultimate victory.</p>
<p>Encouraging Unity to Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill also opposed criticizing previous British governments, saying, "Today, many people wish to investigate the actions of the government and Parliament in recent years that have led to this catastrophe. They seek to punish those responsible for guiding our affairs." (Cries of "Listen! Listen!") "This is foolish and harmful behavior. Know that there are far too many responsible parties to investigate exhaustively. Everyone should examine their own conscience and reflect on their words, just as I do. I can assert that if we start a conflict between the past and the present, we will lose our future." (Cries of "Listen! Listen!") "Therefore, I cannot condone making any distinctions among the members of the current government. It must be known that the current government was formed in a time of crisis, with the aim of uniting the opinions of all parties and all sectors. It has received the almost unanimous support of both houses. Its members intend to stand on the same ground and obey the House of Commons. They will govern the country and engage in warfare." (Cheers) "But in today's era, there is one absolute necessity: each member who attempts to fulfill their duty day by day must be respected. Their subordinates must also know that their leaders are not puppets, here today and gone tomorrow. Any guidance they give must be strictly and faithfully followed. If we do not do this, we will not be able to cope with the current difficulties. I believe that it would not be very beneficial for this House to extend this debate this afternoon in an open meeting. We plan to convene a closed-door meeting on Thursday. I believe that this is a good opportunity for many people to express their opinions sincerely and for the House of Commons to discuss important matters, without allowing our dangerous enemies to read everything the next morning."</p>
<p>Prepared to Fight Alone</p>
<p>"I am not surprised by the events that have transpired in France in the past two weeks. In fact, I made every effort to clearly state the worst possibilities two weeks ago. I also stated at that time that no matter what happens in France, it will not affect Britain and the British Empire's determination to continue fighting. If necessary, we are prepared to fight even if it means enduring for several years and standing alone." (Cheers)</p>
<p>"In the past few days, we have successfully evacuated the majority of the tens of thousands of troops on the transportation lines in France. Seven-eighths of the troops sent to France since the beginning of the war (350,000 out of 400,000) have returned home safely." (Cheers) "The rest are currently fighting alongside the French army and have achieved great victories in local engagements. We have also transported back a large amount of military supplies, rifles, and various munitions that have been sent to France over the past nine months. Therefore, we now have a very large and powerful force on this island, including our best and most experienced troops. Hundreds of thousands of them have already fought against the Germans and feel that they are no less capable than the German army." (Cheers) "Today, there are more than 1.25 million soldiers under arms on this island, in addition to 500,000 volunteer defense corps, only a portion of whom have not yet received rifles and other weapons. We have enlisted everyone who has a gun in the defense forces. We hope that our weapons will increase significantly in the near future. We also plan to immediately summon and train a large number of soldiers. Those who have not been called up or are engaged in the great task of manufacturing munitions may retain their original jobs to serve the country until they are needed."</p>
<p>Inexhaustible Human Resources</p>
<p>"We also have troops from the Dominions here." (Cries of "Listen! Listen!") "Canadian troops did land in France, but they have now been safely evacuated. Although they expressed disappointment, they maintained excellent order and did not lose any artillery. These Dominion troops will now also participate in the defense of the homeland."</p>
<p>"I fear that the above statement regarding this very large force will raise a question: why did this large army not participate in the great battle in France? I must state that, apart from the divisions that are being trained and organized domestically, only the equipment of twelve divisions has reached the point where it can be deployed overseas. The number of these troops has reached the required number that France hoped to be able to deploy in France in the ninth month of the war. Domestically, our forces will of course gradually increase every week. An invasion of Great Britain would require large-scale transportation, and after transporting the enemy forces across the sea, it would be necessary to maintain them and continuously supply them with the munitions needed for a major war. Once a large army arrives in England, a major war will inevitably break out."</p>
<p>Offshore Invasions Are Not Difficult to Handle</p>
<p>"We should now mention the Navy. In short, we still have a Navy." (Cheers) "Some people seem to have forgotten this. We must remind them, because for more than thirty years, I have always participated in discussions about the possibility of overseas invasion. At the beginning of the last war, I represented the Navy Department and was responsible for transporting all the regular army overseas. However, at that time, our national defense forces had just been called up and were untrained. Therefore, the island had virtually no combat-ready troops for several months. At that time, although Germany had a great battle fleet, with a ratio of ten to sixteen compared to Britain, and could launch a war at any time, the Navy was confident that it could prevent a group attack. Today, the German navy only has two or three ships worth mentioning. We have also received information that the Italian Navy also intends to come to these seas and seize maritime superiority. If Italy really intends to do this, I can only announce that we will gladly grant Mr. Mussolini the convenience of passing through the Strait of Gibraltar, so that he may participate in the work he desires. The British fleet now has a genuine sense of curiosity to see whether the Italian navy still meets the standards of the last war or has completely lost its original strength." (Laughter) "Therefore, in my opinion, in terms of large-scale overseas invasion, our ability to cope with it today is far superior to many periods of the last war and the first few months of this war, when our other troops had not yet been trained, and the British Expeditionary Force had been deployed overseas and was still overseas."</p>
<p>"The British Navy has never claimed that it can prevent an attack by five thousand or ten thousand people, suddenly crossing the sea in the dark of night or a foggy morning and landing at several points on the coast. The effectiveness of maritime power, especially in modern circumstances, depends entirely on whether the invading force is large-scale. Given our military strength, the invaders must be large-scale to be effective. Because it is large-scale, the British Navy can find the enemy and attack. We must know that even if there are five divisions of troops, no matter how lightly equipped, they will need two hundred to two hundred and fifty ships. With the progress of modern aerial reconnaissance and photography, it is not easy to organize such a large-scale military transport, assemble it, and have it cross the ocean without any powerful navy to protect it. There is a great possibility that this military transport will be intercepted long before it reaches the shore. Soldiers will also face the danger of drowning or being pulverized by bombs when attempting to land."</p>
<p>The Enemy, However Cunning, Will Find No Opportunity to Apply His Skill</p>
<p>"We also have a great system of minefields, which have recently been greatly strengthened. Only we know the routes that can be traversed through them. If the enemy attempts to clear a passage through these minefields, the British Navy will destroy any minesweepers and any other forces used to protect them. With our overwhelming superiority at sea, it will not be difficult to carry out this task."</p>
<p>"The above are the normal arguments that we have relied on and which have been well-tested and well-proven in many years of recent wars. However, one question remains: can this solid guarantee be cleverly destroyed by any new method? This may seem unlikely, but the Admiralty is still paying attention to this." (Laughter) "The Admiralty's main duty is to destroy any large-scale overseas expeditionary force before it reaches or as it reaches the coast of the island. It would be neither beneficial nor harmful to elaborate on this, as it would allow others to generate ideas that they may have previously thought of and others may not be willing to explain their true ideas in exchange. All I wish to say is that we must be constantly vigilant. The enemy will devote great effort to studying this problem, as the enemy is cunning and full of new tricks and plans. We are currently using the intelligence and imagination of a large number of well-trained and fully qualified modern personnel to study ways to counter new possibilities. There are many kinds of possibilities that have been proposed, some of which are foolish and ridiculous, while others are not entirely unreasonable. The House of Commons can rest assured that we are taking precautions."</p>
<p>Explaining the Reasons for Failure in the Norwegian Campaign</p>
<p>"Some people will ask why the British Navy could not stop the German action of crossing the Skagerrak to Norway with a large army. It must be known that the conditions in the English Channel and the North Sea are very different from those in the Skagerrak. Due to the distance, we could not provide air support to ships at sea. As a result, because of the proximity of the main enemy air force in that area, we were forced to only use our submarines. We could not implement the decisive blockade or interception that we could implement against warships at sea. Although our submarines sank many enemy ships, they could not prevent the invasion of Norway." Mr. Churchill went on to mention the major issues of aerial invasion and the future struggle between the British and German air forces, saying that "It seems difficult to achieve a large-scale aerial invasion if the British Air Force is not effectively subdued by the enemy. This is the truth and need not be elaborated on."</p>

<h3>The French Government Urges the People to Remain Calm; Cities with Populations Over 20,000 Are Designated as Non-Defended Cities</h3>
<p>Bordeaux: Interior Minister Pomaret recently announced on the radio to the nation that all cities with a population of over 20,000 are designated as non-defended cities in order to avoid bombing and war. Even if enemy forces are approaching, all residents should remain in their homes, and all civil servants must not leave their posts without permission, or they will be dismissed immediately. The Minister himself will set an example. Hundreds of men, women, and children have fled from various places in the north to the south, and their suffering is unbearable. This situation is a serious error and should be stopped immediately. At this time of national crisis, our troops are still fighting, and the people in the rear must abide by discipline, remain calm, and act as a support. Otherwise, they will only be troubling themselves and causing unnecessary anxiety. France wants to survive and will surely survive. (Havas, 19th)</p>

<h3>Knowledge for Married Couples: Do You, as a Husband, Understand? Why Does Your Wife Hate You?</h3>
<p>— Co-authored by Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor, and Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>(Hours) 10 AM to 6 PM, Closed Sundays</p>
<p>Woman is great. A man's entire life is simply inseparable from women. Everyone grows up in the embrace of motherly love. Upon reaching adulthood, parents seek a spouse for him, and he himself seeks love. After marriage, he returns to the sweet and tender embrace of his wife's love. If a young husband cannot obtain his wife's love, his misery is likely doubly worse than that of an infant deprived of its mother's embrace!</p>
<p>Do you, young husband, understand why you cannot obtain your wife's love? I hope you are not a fool in life. No matter how high-sounding the reasons for discord between couples may be, marriage is a union based on sexual relations, and the fulfillment or lack thereof in sexual life is the key to your love. If you possess a strong physique and abundant energy, when your wife is filled with youthful passion and affection, the sexual life naturally present between couples will enlighten her, making her feel the value of her husband and the joy of life. Then she will wholeheartedly belong to you. At this time, not only will you feel victorious and happy, but the foundation of your love will also be deeply rooted! Strong love and a rich life are enough to inspire your courage to advance on the great road of life, and help you succeed in building a family and establishing a career! However, if a man has committed self-abuse and nocturnal emissions, or if post-marital debauchery and indulgence have depleted the endocrine fluids of the reproductive glands, which are the source of life, then various symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, dissipated energy, and premature aging will abound. How can such a sick husband, even with a beautiful wife and concubines, coordinate with his wife in married life? Thus, good things often turn into hateful things. How boring is this? At the same time, how can a wife endure wasting her youth and sacrificing her happiness for so long? Some become ill due to depression, while others engage in adultery or elope due to sexual urges. Still others become enraged and use this as an excuse to file for divorce from their husbands. Such cases are countless in today's society!</p>
<p>From the above, it is undeniable that the husband's energy is the driving force behind the love between husband and wife. Therefore, a wise husband will always seek to enhance his energy. If he occasionally feels weak or has the aforementioned symptoms, he should immediately purchase and take "Shengzhi Su," the most effective reproductive gland hormone preparation, to nourish his brain, kidneys, essence, and blood, and nerves. This preparation has been proven by Chinese and foreign doctors to have the effect of producing essence and nourishing the kidneys, promoting development, and continuous use for a month will surely cure various symptoms and make energy twice as strong. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can further prolong life, reverse aging, and rejuvenate. However, those with nocturnal emissions must also take "Ximitu's Solid Essence Tablets" to consolidate the essence gate and stop leakage, which will definitely be more effective. When I was in the United States, many famous doctors experimented with and adopted this good medicine, and all achieved amazing results. After I returned to China, I introduced it to the people, and the number of patients who have been cured is no less than 100,000. Therefore, it has long been popular all over the world, and major pharmacies in this city, both Chinese and Western, also sell it.</p>
<h3>Beauty: Effective Treatment for Atrophied Breasts</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>In the past, writers described a woman's walk as "flowers swaying in the breeze." In fact, describing ancient beauties as "flowers swaying in the breeze" is inappropriate, because old-fashioned women with narrow, three-inch golden lilies looked like walking corpses, to put it bluntly. They were not walking at all, they were simply moving their feet. How could there be "flowers swaying in the breeze"? Atrophied breasts? Only the daughters of today's era know the loveliness of beauty. They do not want to have any damage to any part of their body, and let it fully develop until they grow into adults (i.e., fully developed). Then the breasts are high, the person is tall, and the buttocks are high. When these three high positions are combined with a narrow waist, the curve must be beautiful. If you wear high heels, then walking is like "flowers swaying in the breeze."</p>
<p>Indeed, women with high breasts and high buttocks, not to mention that we will feel infinitely intoxicated when we see them in person! Even if we close our eyes and think about it occasionally, we feel that such women have many sweet aftertastes. Therefore, beauty queens occupy all kinds of advantages in materially civilized metropolises. Why not make ordinary backward women feel envy and hatred? However, I want to advise ordinary backward women that it is useless to resent others for not being competitive. Because your backwardness is just a bit lacking in beauty—atrophied breasts, thin buttocks, and lean muscles. If you can take the world-famous gynecological medicine "Shengzhi Su" for women in time, then in less than two months, your complexion will be ruddy, your muscles will be plump, your buttocks will be round, and your breasts will be as high as if they have been inflated. The ancients said: "A scholar should be viewed with new eyes after three days of separation." At this time, can't you also compete with others in social situations? In short, science is indeed great. Defects that people have always thought were regrettable are now satisfactorily resolved. But one thing that I have to ask my female compatriots to pay attention to is that there are many similar drugs on the market. When purchasing, you must resolutely specify "Shengzhi Su" for women, so as not to mistakenly purchase other drugs, which may hinder your health!</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission Should Not Be Ignored</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Is it not an easy thing to seek artemisia for three years for a disease of seven years? However, it is actually ignored! Therefore, we should not be afraid of disease, but only afraid of ignoring disease. Especially for problems like nocturnal emission, which are usually painless and non-itching, it is easiest to make people ignore it. How can you know that painless and non-itching diseases are often the most serious!</p>
<p>The semen in our human body is the most precious endocrine secretion of the reproductive glands, including various valuable endocrine secretions from the pituitary gland, kidney glands, and testicle glands. It usually irrigates the whole body through blood circulation, functioning to help growth, promote metabolism, and nourish the brain, sex organs, spinal cord, and other nerves. If you suffer from nocturnal emission and delay treatment, this endocrine secretion will gradually be exhausted. Then brain failure, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, backache, back pain, kidney deficiency, premature washing, impotence, incomplete development, premature aging, and other symptoms will abound. May I ask, does this kind of man still have a heroic spirit? Not only will he feel a lack of energy and difficulty in coping with his academic and career future, but he will also be ashamed of his wife and hated by his wife, leading to various family tragedies such as elopement and divorce!</p>
<p>However, nocturnal emission is not an incurable disease. Moreover, there is now an invention of a specific medicine. This is "Ximitu's Solid Essence Tablets" secretly made by Dr. Ximitu of Germany. Patients who take this specific medicine can consolidate the essence gate and calm the nerves and stop nocturnal emission on the night after taking it. Even severe nocturnal emission can be cured after taking it for a few days. However, those who already have the above-mentioned symptoms due to nocturnal emission must also take the reproductive hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves. Continuous use for one month will surely cure various symptoms and restore perfect health. If the patient can come to our clinic in this city for diagnosis and treatment, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Ironclad Facts</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(1) Young People with Nocturnal Emission Should Not Abandon Themselves</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Fuqing, 22 years old, from Pinghu, was intelligent since childhood and loved to study tirelessly. Therefore, although his family was not very wealthy, he was still able to enjoy the right to university education at a certain university in this city, because his uncle often subsidized him. However, Mr. Chen suffered from nocturnal emission due to excessive use of his brain. At first, it was only three or four times a month, but then it gradually increased. Later, it became inevitable every night. After being too tired, there were occasional spermatorrhea during the day. As a result, his mind was dazed, he often suffered from insomnia at night, and he felt dizzy, bloated, tinnitus, and blurred vision as soon as he thought about it. Therefore, his academic performance plummeted. If he worked a little, he felt sore waist, back pain, and physical exhaustion, and he was almost unable to support himself and could not get out of bed! Mr. Chen was hit by this pain and suddenly developed a pessimistic thought. One day, he wrote a letter of doom and intended to commit suicide by throwing himself into the river. Fortunately, he was discovered and dissuaded by his classmates, and they introduced him to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After I examined his symptoms, I instructed his classmates to go to the Wuzhou Pharmacy to purchase two boxes of "Ximitu's Solid Essence Tablets" and two dozen reproductive hormone preparations "Shengzhi Su" and make him take them at the same time. New medical techniques such as electrotherapy injections were also used every other day. After a month of careful diagnosis and treatment, it was only a month until the beginning of this month, and all his illnesses were cured, and he became an active, healthy, studious, and intelligent young man again.</p>
<p>(2) A Husband with Kidney Deficiency Should Think About Your Beloved Wife</p>
<p>Mr. Zhao Zhiming, 26 years old, got married last winter. His wife is indeed a beautiful girl. Although Mr. Zhao loved her, he always felt the pain of being unable to meet her needs in married life. Therefore, their love was also very weak. Mr. Zhao had symptoms of premature ejaculation and impotence after marriage, and occasionally had nocturnal emission. Sometimes, Mr. Zhao thought of his wife and felt extremely guilty and hateful in his heart: so last month, he came to our clinic in person to cure his illness. I immediately instructed him to purchase two dozen reproductive hormone preparations "Shengzhi Su" and one box of "Ximitu's Solid Essence Tablets" and make him take them at the same time. After more than a month, he now feels strong and healthy, and his illness has been completely cured. The love between husband and wife is deep and sincere. Mr. Zhao can truly be said to be a lover of his wife.</p>

<h3>The Situation in Nanyang is Perilous: Japan's Conspiracy in Burma</h3>
<p>US President Roosevelt announced last week that the US fleet would remain stationed in the Pacific indefinitely. Admiral Richardson, Commander-in-Chief of the US Navy, also announced yesterday that the US fleet, which was originally scheduled to sail to various ports along the Pacific coast in early July, has now been cancelled. At the same time, according to the Domei News Agency's Hainan Island telegram, Lieutenant General Tanaka, Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, has arrived on the island to "inspect." The North China Daily News's Tokyo telegram said that the demarcation agreement currently signed between Japan and the Soviet Union can, on the one hand, prevent the recurrence of incidents there this summer, and on the other hand, allow both parties to develop freely elsewhere. Since Japan and the Soviet Union do not need to monitor each other in Manchuria, the Soviet Union can expand in the Baltic Sea and other places as much as possible, and Japan can also take the opportunity to promote its southward policy. Regarding Japan's southward policy, this newspaper has already published two translated articles yesterday. Now, the Shanghai communication published in the New York Times will be translated as follows:</p>
<p>As early as 1892, British Prime Minister Salisbury firmly advocated that the conditions for loans to the Chinese government should stipulate that British capital should be allowed to build a railway connecting Rangoon, Burma, with Sichuan Province in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>In that era, the Chinese government tried its best to oppose this plan. France's desire to develop northward from Vietnam was also opposed in the same way. However, today, 75,000 patriotic Chinese workers are busy building this railway line, and a British company is providing financial assistance. China is extremely in favor of this, as is France.</p>
<p>This is an important development and a far-reaching plan of political importance, and the reason for this result is due to Japan's invasion of China, the blockade of the Chinese coast, and Japan's occupation of major Chinese ports.</p>
<p>American trade has suffered heavy losses due to Japan's invasion of China, and Burma currently occupies an important new position, not only because it is the back door for China's imports and exports, but also because it is the eastern border of the British Empire on the Asian continent.</p>
<p>Since Japan has practically made the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway lose its use in transporting military supplies, it is paying close attention to the importance of the Yunnan-Burma Highway. But until now, Japan has not bombed the completed highway connecting Chongqing to Burma, and the uncompleted railway in China, but has only been active in Burma, hoping to make this important road for trade and supply lose its effectiveness.</p>
<p>According to the 1931 census, there were only 667 Japanese in Burma. The total number of Japanese currently exceeds 4,000. Currently, in every Burmese village, there is one or two Japanese dentists, and there are photography supply stores, ostensibly selling landscape photos and cheap cameras.</p>
<p>Burmese villagers and farmers do not value modern dentists, and ordinary people are also very poor and unable to love cameras. But these people all believe in the pro-Japanese and anti-British propaganda of Japanese spies, who say that Japan is a nation destined to shoulder the task of liberating the Far East.</p>
<p>The British authorities also understand this situation, because in early 1938, the headquarters of Japanese spies in Yangon spent a lot of time and money to help the Burmese national movement, hoping to use disturbances, riots, and local rebellions to attack the transportation of military supplies to China by the Yunnan-Burma Railway and Highway.</p>
<p>Burma covers an area of 370,000 square miles, and according to the latest census, it has a total of 14,667,000 people. However, these people are divided by ethnic animosity and have 130 different languages. Such a complex social organization is extremely beneficial to Japanese spies, who have obtained the assistance of the extremely ethnic party "Miao Qite" to provoke ethnic hatred.</p>
<p>The party recently issued a notice to the British government and the Governor of Burma, requesting that the transportation of military supplies from Burma to China be terminated.</p>
<p>At the end of 1938, when the Burmese rebellion was at its peak, the Yangon press published the so-called Japanese government's instructions to the Japanese consulate in Yangon, and the Japanese side never denied this document. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>"The occurrence of the Burmese rebellion can cut off the military supplies transported by the Chongqing government through the mountainous areas of the country to China. The rebels should destroy the bridges on the Burmese border rivers, delaying and endangering the transportation of goods. It is even possible to intercept these military supplies."</p>
<p>Currently, the assistance that China receives from countries around the world lands in Yangon. German assistance is carried by Italian ships without German trademarks. Three American routes currently use Yangon as their port of call.</p>
<p>From Yangon, these military supplies are transported by rail to Lashio on the Sino-Burmese border, or up the Irrawaddy River to Bhamo. From Lashio to the Chinese border, the Burmese government has built a 77-mile highway. From the Sino-Burmese border, the Chongqing-Burma Highway can reach the Chinese capital Chongqing.</p>
<p>An American company has also built a large-scale aircraft factory on the Burmese border, where the Yunnan-Burma Highway connects to China, and another factory is being built in Yangon.</p>
<p>If China dispatches 100 transport vehicles a day on the border, each carrying 300 tons, then 9,000 tons of important military supplies will be imported every month. However, the journey from the car to Chongqing takes two weeks, so 1,400 transport vehicles must be maintained to travel back and forth. This number does not include cars dedicated to carrying gasoline and parts.</p>
<p>China currently operates 1,000 military vehicles on this highway, which can be open to traffic for seven months a year, and imports 6,000 tons per month. In total, June to October is the secluded season. At that time, floods will destroy bridges and damage the roadbed, so the road cannot be used to its full capacity for transportation.</p>
<p>As for exports, all the cars of the Chinese government are mainly used to transport China's most profitable export goods, such as tung oil, bristles, leather, , , and the like.</p>
<p>At the same time, China is continuing to carry out railway construction work, and the railway traffic from Chongqing to Yangon will soon be completed. The roadbed is progressing quickly, and many tunnels have already been dug. In some areas, the tracks have already been laid. It is hoped that this line can be completed in 1941. By then, the line from Yangon to Lashio in Burma can be extended to the Sino-Burmese border and connected to the railway in the kingdom, and Salisbury's 48-year-old plan can be realized.</p>
<p>Britain began to conquer Burma in 1824, but did not conquer the entire territory until 1886. Burma used to be four independent kingdoms and was merged with India for many years, but in 1937, Britain, fearing the development of the national liberation movement, separated it from India and became another colony.</p>
<p>From a military point of view, Burma is India's second important defense line, and Singapore is the first important defense line. In today's situation, although the European war is imminent, strengthening the eastern defense of Burma is still very important--the obvious purpose is to target Japan--currently 14% of Burma's income is used for military purposes.</p>
<p>In July 1939, the Governor of India had a long and important meeting with the Governor of Burma and other military experts on adjusting the national defense plan. As a result of this meeting, the production of important military supplies in Burma has been increased, the air force has also been expanded, the number of airfields has more than doubled, and the coastal defense has also been improved.</p>
<p>Burma's main wartime products are kerosene, iron sand, coal, lead, tungsten, rice, and ramie.</p>
<p>This vast area has now become an important frontier for Britain. The European people residing there, including military and civil servants, number only 28,000. Apart from this, there are only a very small number of Central American people.</p>
<h3>A Bad Harvest is Bound to Follow a Great War: Europe is on the Brink of Famine</h3>
<p>For several months, this reporter has traveled through most of Europe. From what I have observed, I am convinced that Europe will encounter famine. This reporter stayed as a guest for seven days at the home of a large landowner in a wealthy area of a Romanian border province. The landowner apologized and said, "A year ago, I should have sent a car to meet you, but now the cars have been requisitioned by the army, and even the farm's heavy vehicles and tractors have been requisitioned. We have to use wheelbarrows instead. The 'we' are the strong men who have gone to the army, leaving behind the old, disabled, women, and children, who depend on each other to survive. At this time next year, there will be nothing to eat and hunger will be rampant."</p>
<p>From here to the north, the Soviet army is eyeing. Extensive wheat fields have been dug into winding and continuous trenches. The reporter then crossed the Bukovina region, which is a grain-producing area in Germany. Germany takes at least 12% of its livestock and wheat from this area. However, the railway tracks there are extremely crowded with oil being transported to Germany, and there is no food transportation at all.</p>
<p>There are still 100,000 Polish refugees in Romania, who consume a lot of food every day. Romania is in danger of being attacked from three sides, so it mobilized an army of 2 million people, who eat their fill and do nothing, allowing agricultural affairs to be abandoned. Passing through Yugoslavia, Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria, what I saw and heard was the same sight: soldiers idling all day long, and the surrounding fields were barren.</p>
<p>Italy's food problem is also very serious. Only 1/10 of the country's land is arable, and its colonies supply very little. Even the small amount of food supplied by the Balkan Peninsula is bought by countries such as Britain and France. Food prices in Italy have soared by 1/10 in a week. Profiteers hoard goods for speculation. In one month, 33,000 such unscrupulous merchants were arrested.</p>
<p>The situation in Spain is even worse. A year ago, the government army and the National Army faced off against each other, ravaging the entire country. Wherever the army passed, the food was looted, and the orchards were razed to the ground. All livestock that could fill the stomach were slaughtered. Even other livestock that could be milked instead of cows could not be bought even with high compensation. Villagers have gone without milk and bread for many days.</p>
<p>Hungary had a poor harvest last year, and 100,000 Polish refugees are pouring in. The country has adjusted bread production and stipulated that meat should not be eaten on two days of each week. The country has a population of about 1 million, most of whom are farmers, who are now also bound by weapons. Other countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium have also suffered from military disasters and are already known for their food shortages. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>National Northwest Institute of Technology Actively Expanding; Practice Factory to Cooperate with the Department of Construction; Establishment of Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Specialist Programs Planned</h3>
<p>(Hanzhong Airmail) The National Northwest Institute of Technology, formed by the merger and reorganization of the Beiyang, Pingmin, Dongda, and Jiaozuo Institutes of Technology, has been actively reorganized by President Lai Lian in the past two years. It has not only become the only "engineering university" in the Northwest, but has also become a large-scale engineering academic institution in the country. There are nine hundred students. This year, the civil engineering, mechanical engineering, aeronautical engineering, electrical engineering, mining and metallurgy, chemical engineering, and textile engineering graduates total more than 160. All have been introduced by the institute to various factories and production and construction agencies and have been hired by various parties. After the graduation ceremony in early June, they will depart for various places to accept employment. In addition to the existing eight engineering departments and the Institute of Engineering Research and the Department of Engineering Academic Extension, the institute plans to add mechanical and electrical engineering specialist courses. New students will be enrolled through a unified examination by the Ministry of Education; the institute does not conduct its own enrollment. It is estimated that the total number of students in the next academic year will be over one thousand. The current school buildings are insufficient. The construction of student and faculty dormitories is underway. Classrooms, physics, chemistry, mining and metallurgy, hydraulic engineering laboratories, and the library are also being actively expanded. A site has been purchased outside Hanzhong for the construction of a practice factory, which will cooperate with the Shaanxi Department of Construction to promote the machine industry. The director of the department is concurrently held by Mao Lian. The deans of academic affairs, general affairs, the Institute of Engineering Research, and the Department of Extension are Pan Chengxiao, Yuan Jian, Liu Xiying, and Wang Wenhua, respectively. Several professors will be added in the next academic year, and graduate student quotas will be increased in each department of the Institute of Engineering Research.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Provincial High School Holds Early Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>Since its reorganization in the 16th year of the Republic [1927], Shanghai Provincial High School has consistently followed the established laws and regulations of the Nationalist Government's Ministry of Education and the various instructions of President Chiang in its school management policies. Since the "August 13th" incident, the school moved to the French Concession to hold classes. However, this semester, the school has experienced successive disturbances. Initially, the students' patriotic movement had pure motives, and although their actions slightly overstepped the bounds, the school still maintained them. Later, the focus of their actions suddenly shifted to the school, and they refused guidance, even acknowledging and guaranteeing the conditions they demanded. It is said that the conditions they put forward were numerous, the main ones being as follows: 1. The school authorities must provide a written guarantee that the school will never be changed to a private school. 2. No students involved in patriotic activities may be expelled during the summer vacation. 3. Junior high school third-year students should all be allowed to graduate, and a graduation grade review committee should be organized by the students. After the teachers in charge have graded the papers for each subject, they must be submitted to the committee for review and examination, with the students determining the grades themselves. 4. Junior high school graduates should all be allowed to advance to the first year of senior high school, and after the teachers have graded the entrance examination papers, they must also be submitted to student representatives for review. 5. Students should be allowed to be selected as representatives to attend school affairs committee meetings. 6. Any increase or decrease in teaching staff must first be approved by the students. The school affairs committee considered the above requirements to be beyond the scope of what could be accepted. Therefore, on the 15th of this month, it convened a school affairs committee and a teachers' meeting, and unanimously resolved to advance the start of the summer vacation to June 18th in order to carry out a rectification. It is said that the missed lessons will be made up by starting the next semester early. (Dahua News Agency)</p>

<p>Every summer, during the school holidays, the Shanghai YMCA promotes religious cultivation and operates a religious education society, enabling young people to understand the meaning of life and the paths they should follow, so that they are not bewildered by external things, and to enhance their personality.

The Tong Guang team, led by Ting Du, set off in the early dawn. After a short break, the competition began, with Ding Du and Luo Ertuo serving as referees in turn. Under the competition, because the strength of both sides was equal, the battle situation was extremely tense, and the two sides tied several times, and wonderful performances appeared. Tong Guang's vanguard took the lead with 3-2 in the first game. In the second game, Russian Tong Qiaoqi defeated Li Da'en with 21-19, tying the score at 5 each.

<h3>With the Situation Turbulent and Unstable, Shanghai Residents Should Remain Calm and Composed; The Free City Proposal is Not Taken Seriously by All Parties; British and French Ambassadors Remain Temporarily in Shanghai to Deal with the Situation</h3>
<p>Since Italy's entry into the war, the situation has expanded to the Mediterranean. On one hand, there are peace messages from France and Germany, while the fascist ambitions in the East are flourishing. Taking advantage of this rare opportunity, they are increasingly obviously attempting to encircle the South. As a result, the people of Shanghai are shaken and full of suspicion. The puppet regime is also taking the opportunity to steal fire. It is said that the puppet "mayor" Fu Xiao'an yesterday submitted a formal written request to the consuls of the warring countries, requesting that the defense forces of the warring countries withdraw from the concessions. At the same time, foreign newspapers suggested turning Shanghai into a free city. This has made people even more uneasy. In reality, the evolution of the European war has nothing to do with the Far East. At most, it will have a slight impact on shipping. The defense forces of the concessions have planned perfectly in response to Chuan Xiaoan's request and should not cause any friction. There is no need to worry too much. The so-called free city was proposed during the August 13th incident. This matter is related to Chinese sovereignty and has not been realized. Now it is nothing more than a rehash of old ideas. The United States' consistent policy towards China is that it does not recognize any changes in Chinese sovereignty and territory by force or other means. There is no doubt that the current proposal will be opposed by the United States. However, since receiving news from Hong Kong yesterday that the Japanese army had launched a three-pronged attack on Liangshan from the border of Guangxi Province, and that the sea routes between Haiphong and Hong Kong were blocked, people in the market have been in a state of flux. In fact, in this situation, everything should be handled with a calm attitude, maintained with composure, and not be moved by rumors. Only then can one be at ease. The situation in all directions is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Someone Suggests Establishing a Free City</p>
<p>According to the English-language *China Press*, foreigners in Shanghai have suggested that Shanghai be designated as a "free city" to ensure the future safety of the international city. According to the plan, all of Shanghai would become a demilitarized zone, with neutral zones set up around it. The "free city" would include five zones: Zone A is the current International Settlement; Zone B is the French Concession; Zone C is the area north of the Suzhou Creek and the extraterritorial roads there; Zone D is the area south of the French Concession and south of Hongqiao Road; Zone E is the area on the right bank of the Huangpu River. This "free city" would have separate courts, police, pilotage management, and other agencies, and would be jointly managed by the great powers. According to this plan, Shanghai would become an internationally managed protection political and economic municipal institution. It is also said that the above plan was formulated by the Consular Body and is in the form of a memorandum.</p>
<p>Consular Body's Stance</p>
<p>The Consular Body's Secretary, Mr. Lange, dismissed this rumor as nonsense. Mr. Lange pointed out that in the past few years, there have indeed been proposals for such a plan, but he is absolutely unaware of it at present. According to an observer, this plan was proposed during the August 13th incident. Now that the old story is being retold, it is considered to be a selfish proposal by financial capitalists. Due to the large-scale rumor offensive by a certain party, people are panicked, and these people are making this tentative proposal to maintain their huge floating capital so that they can do evil in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Harmful to China's Territorial Sovereignty</p>
<p>According to an international expert, the plan is likely the opinion of one or two individuals on the foreign side. The territorial sovereignty of the Shanghai Concession belongs entirely to China. According to the plan, the territory would be fundamentally divided, separated from China, and greatly damage China's territorial sovereignty. If this plan were to be realized, it would never be tolerated by the Chinese government.</p>
<p>Seeking Security Requires Cooperation</p>
<p>The person also said that the proper way to stabilize the current concession is for all countries to adhere to the resolutions passed in the past and to maintain the status quo together. Although a certain party has wild ambitions and is watching intently, as long as all countries cooperate closely and respond calmly, that party will have no way to use its skills. The current tranquility of the concession is really due to the proper measures taken by all countries. At this time, if there is a sudden proposal for a "free city" plan, it would only be self-disturbance and provide an opportunity for others to take advantage of it.</p>
<p>Few Puppet Troops in the Suburbs of Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday, the English-language *China Press* stated that it was reported that 50,000 puppet troops from Nanjing had secretly arrived in Shanghai from the Jiangning area, causing concerns here about seizing the Shanghai concessions. The arrival of these puppet troops was said to have followed the news of the development of the European war. It was rumored that the Japanese and puppet troops were planning to seize the French Concession. At the same time, it was learned that the French Concession had taken emergency precautions to prevent any unforeseen developments. The authorities stated that all matters within the concession would continue as usual. As for future developments, the French Concession officials remained silent, but said that the status quo would be fully maintained unchanged. When asked about the rumors that Japan would take direct action against the Shanghai concessions, a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy said that the rumors were completely unfounded, but declared that "If there are very significant changes in the European situation, Japan may take some action." However, other Chinese sources said that there are no more than one or two thousand puppet troops in the suburbs of Shanghai. Among them, several hundred who arrived in Nanshi are the puppet "water patrol team" under Ren Yuandao.</p>
<p>British and French Ambassadors Remain Temporarily in Shanghai</p>
<p>British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the morning of the 16th of this month. During this extraordinary period, the ambassador's whereabouts were kept secret, and it was impossible to know which ship he was on. After arriving, he went to the Guanchiu residence on Dunxin Road to rest for a few days, keeping a low profile and rarely socializing. His future whereabouts have not yet been decided. French Ambassador Cosme, who was previously scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 16th to go to Beidaihe for the summer, has not yet left. Since the news of France seeking peace with Germany spread to Shanghai, the staff of the French Consulate, from top to bottom, have been extremely busy. The French Ambassador has also canceled his trip to North China. After the Soviet Consulate was closed, it was once rumored that it would be reopened and that a new policy would be determined after the stationing of Soviet troops, but this was not accurate. Therefore, the Soviet Consulate remains closed. As for the Soviet official news agency in Shanghai, it continues to exist. Recently, the Moscow headquarters sent a new person to Shanghai to take charge.</p>
<p>Italian Side Making Every Effort to Prevent Friction</p>
<p>Since Italy entered the war, the nationals and embassies of various countries in China have recently advised Italian military and civilians in Shanghai to avoid unfortunate incidents with nationals of the warring countries. At the same time, the Italian Consul General in Tianjin and Chairman of the Italian Concession Works Bureau, Mr. Buriki, and the Military Attaché and Guard Commander of the Italian Embassy in Peiping, Mr. Ke Huaxini, also notified Italian expatriates to avoid friction with expatriates from the warring countries. The British and French concession authorities in various parts of China are making every effort to maintain the neutrality of the concessions. Both German and Italian expatriates in the British and French concessions in Shanghai and Tianjin continue to reside as usual. Only a very small number have moved, so incidents between each other have not occurred. Moreover, with the diplomatic authorities of the United States in China mediating and arbitrating, the troubles can be eliminated before they take shape, so that those who covet it have nothing to rely on.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Praise Chinese Soldiers; Soldiers and Officers in Xiangxi are Happy to Die in Battle; Yichang Garrison Engages in Melee Combat</h3>
<p>Colonel Mabuchi, head of the reporting department of the Japanese Army Headquarters in Nanjing, recently went to Nangxi to personally inspect the war situation. According to his observations, although there have been cases of entire armies surrendering in Europe, including the commander-in-chief, the Chinese soldiers in Xiangxi never surrender in groups. From Zhang Zizhong onwards, the officers and soldiers all fought bravely to the death. The battle in the mountains north of Yichang also progressed to bayonet combat, followed by hand-to-hand combat (meaning melee combat). This kind of spirit is different from the soldiers on the European battlefield. Mabuchi also praised this as a "spirit of selflessness and dedication to the public."</p>
<h3>Optimistic View of Conditions in Mainland China by American Doctor: Abundant Grain Reserves, Progress in All Areas</h3>
<p>Dr. Brown, an American physician who has worked in the missionary medical field in China for many years and whose footprints have covered almost all of China, recently arrived in Shanghai from the mainland. He will soon travel to Japan before returning to the United States. During his brief stay in Shanghai, he told reporters about the general situation in the mainland. According to Dr. Brown, he firmly believes that China will ultimately achieve victory and expressed admiration for the great spirit and work displayed in the various areas of Free China. He said there is no fear of food shortages in the mainland, and Sichuan Province in particular has a surplus of grain. The people in the mainland are well-informed about various current events and understand various difficulties. What is particularly surprising is that small villages in remote parts of the mainland often have small wireless radio crystal sets, which they use to listen to the latest news and immediately relay it to the residents of surrounding villages. Dr. Brown recounted, "I remember an old worker who, when I told him I was American, immediately beamed and said to me, 'We all know that America is helping our China.'" Dr. Brown also mentioned that the chairman of Shanxi Province is currently training three thousand young officers in Shaanxi to prepare them for service on the front lines. He told me that although the Japanese army has occupied all of Shanxi Province, the magistrates of all the counties, except for one or two large towns, are loyal to the country. A local official in a certain county in the mainland told Dr. Brown that the people throughout the mainland are united in spirit, which is especially evident in the enthusiasm of the people enlisting in the army. This is largely due to the excessive bombing by Japanese aircraft.</p>
<p>Dr. Brown then told reporters how villages train small groups of personnel, who then gather at larger central points for further training. The number of Chinese aircraft is still insufficient, but small arms are now being manufactured domestically in China, with a very large output. An officer of the Eighth Route Army once told him, "The arsenals of Tokyo do not disappoint us," meaning that the Eighth Route Army has seized large quantities of military supplies from the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>French Government Seals Off Haiphong: A Temporary Precaution, Shanghai Ships to Stop at Hong Kong</h3>
<p>After the expansion of the European war, various rumors have also surfaced in the Far East. Rumors about the seizure of the Dutch East Indies and the South Sea Islands have recently subsided. Since Paris was occupied by the German army, there have been even more rumors of an advance into French Indochina. Yesterday afternoon, shipping circles in this city received a report from the Haiphong branch stating that the French government, as a precautionary measure, has temporarily sealed off Haiphong, prohibiting entry and exit. All ships traveling to Haiphong from Hong Kong have been suspended indefinitely.</p>
<p>Yusheng Ticket Refunds</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson's Yusheng, originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Haiphong this morning, is refunding all Haiphong passenger tickets sold due to the above news. Shippers of cargo bound for Haiphong have also been notified to withdraw their customs declarations. The ship will temporarily only go as far as Hong Kong, awaiting further news. If possible, it still plans to sail to Haiphong. The Taikoo Company's Jinan, which sailed from Shanghai to South China yesterday afternoon, heading to Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, Haikou, and then Haiphong, had already departed when the news of the Haiphong blockade reached Shanghai, so it may still be able to reach Haiphong. A decision will be made after arriving in Hong Kong. However, inquiries to the company indicate that there has been no confirmation.</p>
<p>Shipping Manifests Suspended</p>
<p>Hong Kong authorities are refusing to issue departure manifests for ships sailing to Haiphong. This news has been confirmed by shipping circles in this port yesterday. However, it is said that this measure may be temporary. Many shipping companies in this port own numerous ships that travel between Shanghai and French Indochina, with the transport of Saigon rice being the largest part of this shipping. Most rice ships do not stop in Hong Kong but sail directly between Shanghai and Haiphong. The current attitude of the Hong Kong authorities is precautionary, awaiting future developments.</p>
<h3>Contents of the Shanghai Free City as Reported by Western Newspaper</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that after the news of France's surrender to Germany reached the city a few days ago, the general public became increasingly concerned about the maintenance of the status quo in Shanghai. However, in the uncertain situation, a glimmer of hope has emerged: the consuls of various countries and the authorities of the concessions in Shanghai are currently studying a plan to make Shanghai a self-governing city, in order to protect the future safety of this international metropolis. This plan was drafted in the form of a memorandum by a foreign official for the study of officials from various countries in Shanghai. The main content stipulates that Shanghai be transformed into a politically and economically autonomous city, jointly protected and managed by various countries. Its main purpose is to ensure the safety and stability of the entire Shanghai area and to secure a more solid position in the future. According to the plan, the entire Shanghai area would be demilitarized, and a neutral zone would be demarcated around the city. An independent court system, not subject to Chinese jurisdiction, would be established, along with a joint Chinese-Western police force and separate organizations to manage port affairs. Municipal affairs would be decided by the General Council, and the entire city would be divided into five districts for management. If this plan were implemented, it would eliminate the problem of returning the concessions. The plan is divided into seventeen articles as follows:</p>
<p>Demilitarized Zone Around the Perimeter</p>
<p>(1) A demilitarized zone shall be established around Shanghai, the boundaries of which shall be determined by Japanese military experts in consultation with British, American, French, and Italian military experts. (2) China and the five countries enjoying extraterritorial rights, namely Great Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and Japan, shall conclude a treaty within this demilitarized zone (including the International Settlement, the French Concession, Greater Shanghai, and other areas deemed to be included, as well as surrounding waterways) to establish an autonomous city and a free port, jointly protected and managed by the aforementioned countries. All previously concluded treaties related to the two concessions and the Huangpu River shall be canceled. (3) No Chinese or other foreign troops shall enter or use the area or waterways within this demilitarized zone. Chinese and other foreign military aircraft shall also not fly over the area.</p>
<p>Organizations Formed by Representatives of Various Countries</p>
<p>(4) The autonomous city and the neutral zone, as well as all waterways, shall be managed by organizations formed by representatives of various countries. (5) The autonomous city shall be divided into five districts, each with a branch office for management. District A shall be the former International Settlement, District B shall be the French Concession, District C shall be the area from the mouth of the Huangpu River to the northern bank of Suzhou Creek, including the International Settlement and the extra-settlement roads, District D shall be the area south of the French Concession from the Huangpu River to the Hongqiao Road, and District E shall be Pudong. (6) The purpose of establishing the autonomous city and the autonomous port is to gradually unify police, taxes, sanitation, and public works.</p>
<p>Attempt to Break Away from Chinese Judiciary</p>
<p>(7) The autonomous city shall establish a new judicial system, separate from the Chinese judicial system. However, some Chinese laws shall still be adopted, while the remainder shall be drafted by legal experts, taking into account the situation in Shanghai, and approved by the countries concerned. (8) Each of the five districts of the autonomous city shall have a court, including an appellate court and a supreme court. Chinese judges shall hear all cases involving Chinese citizens. Disputes between Chinese and foreign citizens shall be heard by two judges, one Chinese and one foreign. The appellate court shall have three judges, one Chinese and two foreign. In addition, a special court shall be established to hear cases brought by and against the General Bureau and branch offices of the autonomous city. (9) Until the new laws described in Article 7 are adopted, the current laws shall remain in effect. The autonomous city shall be established, and the new courts shall be established accordingly. After the new laws described in Article 7 are established, the extraterritorial rights of the various countries shall be abolished immediately.</p>
<p>Appointment of Senior Personnel</p>
<p>(10) To avoid various difficulties, all personnel in the two concessions shall not be transferred for the time being. (11) The committee organized by representatives of various countries shall nominate senior personnel for the administrative organs of the autonomous city and the courts of each district. (12) Senior personnel in general for all organs of the autonomous city shall be appointed from the nationals of the countries that signed the above-mentioned treaty.</p>
<p>No Chinese Government Offices Within the Zone</p>
<p>(13) Chinese government offices shall not be located within the autonomous city, with the exception of customs, post offices, and diplomatic missions. However, they shall pay taxes in accordance with regulations, and customs shall also pay a portion of its tax revenue to cover the expenses of the autonomous city. (14) The port authority shall be separated from customs and become an independent agency. (15) The railway stations within the autonomous city shall be managed by the authorities of the autonomous city and shall pay taxes accordingly. (16) A joint Chinese-foreign police force shall be established, under the command of the authorities of the autonomous city. (17) All other police forces or protection forces shall be managed by subsidiary organs designated by the authorities of the autonomous city.</p>
<h3>Important Future Tasks: Expansion of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps; British Businesses Urge Employees to Join; English Contingent Increases by Over a Hundred</h3>
<p>Since the British Consulate issued an advisory to British expatriates in Shanghai to join the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, the response from British expatriates at the time was not enthusiastic. However, a considerable number of Norwegian expatriates from the Scandinavian Peninsula and Jewish refugees have joined. There are also German expatriates who have joined. According to inquiries from reliable sources by the Ping Ming News Agency, British expatriates, recognizing the urgent need to expand the strength of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, have seen British businesses, such as two well-known foreign firms, not only encourage their employees to join the corps, but also offer various incentives, such as issuing cash rewards. Therefore, the number of English troops has increased sharply in the past week, with over a hundred new members. Moreover, the corps' firearms and ammunition are very plentiful. However, in terms of uniforms, the Shanghai Municipal Council is limited by funds and has been unable to purchase new ones for the time being, so they are temporarily using the old uniforms. According to well-informed foreigners, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has made great contributions in the past to assisting the police force's shortcomings, and its tasks in the future will be even more important.</p>
<h3>Permission Granted for Resumption of Service by Maersk Line Vessels: First Vessel Scheduled to Arrive Tomorrow; Considered Neutral Vessels by All Parties</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of World War II in Europe, in early April of this year, German troops suddenly seized Denmark and conquered Norway, and the situation in Europe suddenly became tense. This was the first stage of expansion of the European war. Then, in early May, German troops continued to advance into Holland and Belgium. This was the second stage of the expansion of the European war, and the situation became even more serious. The shipping industry in various countries has been greatly affected. As a result, the schedules and routes of merchant ships from the United Kingdom, France, Holland, and Norway traveling to the Far East have all been kept secret. The vessels of the Danish shipping companies, Jebsen &amp; Co. and Maersk Line, have all successively suspended service and been ordered to concentrate in Hong Kong. Although the vessels belonging to Maersk Line fly the Danish flag, their organization is slightly different. It is a joint venture established by Danish and American merchants, operating on the Pacific route. Therefore, after the Danish ships suspended service, the Maersk vessels docked in the United States and the former U.S. territory of Little Luzon. The American shareholders, seeing that the Maersk vessels would be suspended indefinitely, causing great losses, petitioned the U.S. government for protection and permission to resume service. It has recently been heard that the U.S. government has obtained the consent of the British and French governments and the Shanghai military authorities to recognize the Maersk vessels as neutral ships and to guarantee their safe passage. The Maersk Line shipping company at 210 Jiujiang Road in this city has received official notification, and the vessels have already set sail from their moorings and are sailing to Shanghai to resume service. It is said that the first vessel to arrive in Shanghai will be the Ms. Nlel Maersk. This vessel was previously docked in Little Luzon and has now departed from Little Luzon, scheduled to arrive around the 21st (of this month). It is scheduled to resume service from Shanghai to the United States on Sunday (the 23rd), first going to Los Angeles, then passing through Panama, New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. Two vessels traveling from the United States to Shanghai are the Ms. Grete Maersk and the Ms. Halda Maersk, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai around the 8th of next month and scheduled to depart from Shanghai directly to Little Luzon on the 10th at the same time. Hong Kong is British territory, so in accordance with the U.S. government's Neutrality Act, it will temporarily bypass Taiwan and Hong Kong. The Dong Hui Kee Shipping Agency, which is responsible for the company's cargo solicitation, also issued a Chinese announcement yesterday in accordance with the English notice from Maersk Line, soliciting cargo from various clients.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Begins Crackdown on Grain Market: Led by Mr. Betts; Cooperation with French Concession</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to crack down on illegal profiteering and other misconduct related to rice and grain, has decided to select a number of internal staff members to work with representatives of the French Concession's Price Control Committee to guide this matter, and has appointed Mr. Betts of the Health Department to be in charge. The above organization will make recommendations to the Board of Directors as necessary.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Introduces Aluminum Coin Usage</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in view of the fact that previous issuances of aluminum coins were limited to the financial sector, and their circulation has not been widespread, now after consultation with the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks, has decided to select the most important industries and have the Chamber of Commerce issue letters of introduction. Each trade association will then send representatives directly to the Joint Reserve Committee to discuss the method of application for use, so as to compile and apply for, and then distribute to members of the trade.</p>
<h3>Harana Suffers Minor Accident: Paper Burned, Losses Not Large; Currently Undergoing Repairs to the Hull</h3>
<p>The German Far Eastern Company's Harana, which travels the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou last week with cargo and was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Wenzhou on the 18th. According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the ship suffered an accident in the cargo hold while loading cargo at the Wenzhou wharf on the 17th. The company received a telegram from the ship yesterday stating that the accident involved the paper cargo, and that a few pieces of flammable paper were burned due to carelessness with fire. Fortunately, the fire was discovered early and extinguished after being extinguished, so the losses were minimal. The cargo that has already been loaded is now being reorganized, and it is also reported that the hull will need to be slightly repaired. It is scheduled to come to Shanghai after the repairs are completed.</p>
<h3>News Briefs</h3>
<p>Japanese Ship Agreement: According to the Japanese newspaper, "The East Asia Marine Transportation Co., Ltd." and the recently established "China Shipping Company" may sign ten commercial agreements in the near future. The content is that in the future, all ports that have been opened will be served by vessels of "The East Asia Marine Transportation Co., Ltd.," while ports that have not been opened will be served by vessels of "China Shipping Company." There are other provisions.</p>
<p>Parcel Notice: The postal administration issued a notice regarding parcels, stating that due to special local circumstances, all parcels and bulk small parcels addressed to the Santai Township Agency of the Xin'an Township Post Office in the Zhi Ping District should be temporarily suspended for mailing.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Vehicle Rentals: The Shanghai Municipal Council recently approved on June 20 of this year that the rental price of public rickshaws should not exceed 98 cents in national currency per vehicle per day. It has recently been found that a small number of rickshaw merchants have charged rental fees exceeding the approved maximum limit. A notice was issued yesterday to all rickshaw merchants to strictly comply. Any violations will be severely punished for the license holder, including permanent cancellation of the vehicle license.</p>

<h3>Fate of Refugees Perilous, Misappropriation of Refugee Donations: Relief Association Has Entrusted Lawyers to File Lawsuit; Refugees in Nanshi, Hearing of Dissolution, Anxious and Helpless</h3>
<p>The general manager of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession is Shen Yongkang, and the business is doing quite well. Since November of the year before last, he has been entrusted by the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association to collect a five-percent refugee donation. The Travel Industry Association sends representatives to collect and remit the donations to the Refugee Association on a monthly basis, which issues official receipts. However, the amount remitted each month is only about three or four hundred yuan. The Association, based on the hotel's turnover, calculates that the amount is far short, which is highly suspicious. Recently, a traveler reported to the Association that the hotel had misappropriated refugee donations. After receiving the report, the Association immediately dispatched a lawyer and an accountant to audit the hotel's accounts. It was immediately discovered that the hotel could collect six or seven hundred yuan in refugee donations each month, but the amount remitted was only half of that. From November of the 27th year to May of this year, the total amount misappropriated reached five or six thousand yuan. When questioned, the hotel's accountant stated that he was acting under the instructions of the general manager, Shen Yongkang. The account books were immediately taken back to the Association, and a lawyer has been engaged to file a lawsuit against Shen Yongkang, the general manager of the hotel, for misappropriation.</p>
<p>Nanshi Issues Additional Severance Rations</p>
<p>The Nanshi refugee area has already been feeling the pinch of financial difficulties, and there has been talk of dismissing the younger and stronger refugees. Since the silent return of the priest some days ago, the situation in the refugee area has become even more tragic. Although there is a Rehabilitation Committee organization to maintain it, refugees in the streets and alleys are all looking worried, because they know that their fate will be even more unimaginable from now on. In recent days, the work of the Rehabilitation Committee has been exceptionally busy, such as preparing a clear list of past income and expenditure and a list of refugees, as well as reviewing how to disperse the staff of the various offices and shelters. Yesterday afternoon at around 1:00 p.m., the Rehabilitation Committee convened a meeting in the area, attended by French Vice-Consul Xie Shibai, Director of the General Office Gu Lun, etc. At that time, it was decided to establish a Dispersal Committee, and all refugees would be dismissed by the end of this month. After this news was formally announced, most of the refugees covered their faces and wept, gathering and refusing to disperse, because they still wanted someone to continue to maintain their lives. Subsequently, the Committee, feeling great sympathy for the plight of the refugees, announced that each refugee would receive half a month's rations for the expiration of the dismissal, and an additional twenty days' worth of grain to maintain their lives during the transition period. The refugees dispersed gratefully.</p>
<p>Ningbo Refugee Donations Designated Collection Points</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association issued a public notice soliciting donations for rice purchases in Ningbo, stating that recently, the source of Ningbo's grain has been exhausted, and it is in extreme shortage. There is almost no rice available on the market, and the people have no food for the next day. Sweet potato scraps are being sold out. Tragic incidents of grain robberies occur from time to time. People are panicking, and the situation is serious. The Association believes that this matter concerns the safety of their hometown and cannot be ignored. It has been decided to purchase foreign rice to be shipped to Ningbo for sale at low prices to provide relief. The required funds are quite large, and we can only appeal to all members of the community to contribute generously and join in this righteous cause. We also hope that leaders of various industries, philanthropists, and kind-hearted women will persuade others to donate generously to help those in need and ensure the safety of our hometown. The sincere words are presented with urgency. We hope you will take note of the donation collection points: Siming Bank (Beijing Road), Kenye Bank (Beijing Road), Quanggong Bank (Nanjing Road), Fuyuanzhuang (Ningbo Road), Gengyuzhuang (Ningbo Road), and the Accounting Office of the Association. In addition, the second Donation Solicitation Meeting will be held soon, and we have already sent letters to the trade associations, asking them to send representatives to attend on time on the 22nd of this month.</p>
<p>Jewish Refugees Eager to Disperse</p>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, according to British sources, the number of Jewish people who have been expelled by the German authorities and have come to Shanghai as refugees has now reached 18,000. The total number of foreigners in the Shanghai concessions is 52,000, of which Japanese people are only 11,000. Therefore, Jewish refugees must be the largest group of foreigners in Shanghai. The most pressing issue to be resolved among the foreigners in Shanghai is the problem of food, clothing, and shelter for Jewish refugees. However, the funds required are enormous, and it is not easy to resolve for the time being. The problem of Jewish employment in Shanghai is also worth studying. However, objectively speaking, it is difficult for Jewish people to compete with local Chinese people, because the living standards of Chinese people are much lower than those of foreigners. According to the intentions of some Jewish people who have come to Shanghai, they are eager to disperse to various places in order to find a place to live and avoid gathering in Shanghai, which would lead to a situation of waiting to die.</p>
<h3>Japanese National Ishimura Robbed and Shot to Death, Died from Bullet Wound to Chest</h3>
<p>Ishimura, a Japanese national, 48 years old, worked in the Transportation Department of the Huazhong Industrial Company on Peng Road in this port. Yesterday evening at around 9:00 p.m., Ishimura left the company. When he was walking to a rice shop at the end of Zhoujiazui Road, he suddenly encountered a robber who threatened him with a gun, intending to search for his valuables. Ishimura resisted, but unexpectedly angered the robber, who fired a shot, hitting Ishimura in the vital area of the chest. He fell to the ground and could not get up. Seeing that he had caused trouble, the robber fled without searching for valuables, carrying the gun and disappearing without a trace. When nearby patrolling police officers received the news, they immediately reported it to the Japanese Consulate and the Huishan Police Station. The Huishan Police Station urgently dispatched armed detectives to investigate the scene of the incident. They immediately called for an ambulance to send Ishimura to the Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. Because the injury was in a vital area, he could not be cured and died.</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper Reporter Mr. Xu Chengxu Passed Away Yesterday Due to Illness: Body at the Shanghai Funeral Home; Encoffining at 4:00 P.M. Today</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Chengxu, a reporter for our newspaper, was talented and virtuous, and he was honest with people. He served in the newspaper for more than ten years, and was diligent and outstanding, which was admired by his colleagues. However, he suddenly contracted typhoid fever a week ago. After several treatments, he did not improve, and unfortunately passed away at 4:00 p.m. yesterday (the 19th). His talent was not fully realized, and we deeply mourn his loss. Mr. Xu's body is scheduled to be encoffined at 4:00 p.m. today (the 20th) at the Shanghai Funeral Home. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Chengxu's Last Appearance</p>
<p>Suddenly Afflicted by Illness and Passed Away</p>
<p>Mr. Xu recently devoted himself to calligraphy in addition to reading, collecting rubbings and practicing. He practiced diligently every evening at the newspaper office in his spare time. He mastered almost all the essence of Yan Zhenqing's ancient texts. He was still writing as usual in the newspaper office ten days ago. Unexpectedly, on the 10th of the month, he suddenly felt unwell, but he still managed to come to the newspaper office. Later, because he was too ill to get up, the doctor diagnosed him with typhoid fever, and he began to take leave. He was always loyal and trustworthy to friends who entrusted him with things. The afternoon before yesterday, his illness was already severe, but he still kept in mind a colleague who went to ask him to handle matters on his behalf. At that time, he had already developed a rash from the typhoid fever and was suffering from severe internal heat. The doctors were helpless, and he passed away at his residence at 4:00 p.m. yesterday.</p>

His body was moved to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Dallas Evening Road in the evening and is scheduled to be encoffined at 4:00 p.m. today (the 20th). Mr. Xu never managed his property. He liked to associate with dignitaries from all walks of life, helping people in need without hesitation. Therefore, he was particularly impoverished after his death.</p>

<h3>Lu Xiaoliang and Dance Hostess Commit Suicide by Poisoning: Both Die Together in a Closed Room in a Hotel</h3>
<p>Shen Yanyu (also known as Shen Jinfang), a dance hostess currently working at the Dahua Ballroom, is 20 years old. At the age of four, she was abducted by bandits and sold to a brothel madam named Shen as an adopted daughter. When she grew up, because of her good looks, she was forced to work as a prostitute. Recently, she became inextricably linked with Lu Qiliang (also known as Lu Xiaoliang), a 27-year-old man from Zhejiang who was in the rice and grain business. Because she was unable to buy her freedom and he was already married, the two of them went to Room 65 of the Chuan Jiang No. 3 Hotel on Baliqiao Street in the French Concession on the 15th and stayed together for three nights. They then committed suicide by taking a large dose of opium together on the evening before last (the 18th), emulating the "lovebirds." Yesterday morning (the 19th) at around 10:00 a.m., the tea boy entered the room to check on them and saw that their faces were pale, there was vomit everywhere, and they were barely breathing. He knew that they had taken poison and immediately reported it to the front desk, who reported it to the police. An ambulance was dispatched to take them to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, they had been poisoned too deeply. Lu died on the way, and Shen also gradually died at the hospital. The police sent detectives to investigate and notify their families and sent the two bodies to Tongren Fuyuantang for examination. It was also learned that the deceased was Lu Yaoliang, a native of Taizhou, who had worked as a detective in the French police force for several months before resigning due to an incident. Later, he opened a small shop at 92 Grover Road to do business. He had a wife, but recently, because he became acquainted with a woman named Shen Jinfang, Lu withdrew all the capital from the store, making it impossible to compensate, and took this drastic measure.</p>
<h3>Two-Year-Old Girl Abducted by Bandits While Being Held</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 10:30 a.m., a kidnapping incident occurred inside 76 Xinjiapo Road in West Shanghai. A local man named Zhu Bingrong, who lives at 25 Lane 545 Connaught Road, runs the Chengtai Plywood Factory. Yesterday, when the incident occurred, Zhu happened to be free and was chatting at a small hotel at 76 Xinjiapo Road while holding his two-year-old daughter, Xinlian. Unexpectedly, two bandits armed with box guns rushed to Zhu's side and warned him not to make a sound. One of the bandits snatched the girl from Zhu's arms and boarded a car that had been waiting nearby, speeding away. After Zhu recovered from the shock, he reported the situation to the police and requested that they track down the bandits.</p>
<h3>Criminals in School Kidnapping and Murder Case Should Be Executed: After Killing Three Children, They Extorted Ransom Money Again; The Criminals' Methods are Extremely Vicious, a True First; The Case Has Been Adjudicated and Sentencing is Scheduled for the 25th</h3>
<p>Xiangxi, the nine-year-old son of Mrs. Pan Gu, the housewife of Yunji Fashion Company at 311 Tongfu Road; Yongkang, the nine-year-old son of Mrs. Shen Chen at 282 Lane 5 Tongfu Road; and Changfa, the eleven-year-old son of Mrs. Wang Li at 336 Lane 5 Tongfu Road, were all students at Zhiyi Primary School in Dazhongli, Tongfu Road. On the 11th of last month, at noon, Zhong Bingchu, a partner of Yunji, and Shen, along with his brother Zhong Jianchu and Wang Shengxiang, lured and kidnapped the three children. That night, in the wasteland of the Oriental Library on Baoshan Road in Zhabei,</p>
<p>they died one after another. The criminals also sent letters to the families, demanding a ransom of 50,000 yuan, and obtained 3,000 yuan. The Central Police Department became aware of the matter and arrested the two Zhongs and Wang, along with suspects Liu Bingcheng, Xu Jinxiang, Yao Hexiang, and Wang Shangxian. All were sent to the Special First Court for interrogation and detention. Details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Liu Yugui resumed the hearing in the Second Criminal Court. People from all walks of life attended the hearing, as the kidnappers not only kidnapped the three children, but also killed them that night and then used this to threaten and extort money. Their methods were extremely vicious and their intentions treacherous, truly</p>
<p>unprecedented. First, Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer for the Police Department, prosecuted the two Zhongs and Wang Shengxiang under Article 348 of the Criminal Law for kidnapping and murder, and stated the facts of the case, saying that the Police Department had found that Liu Bingcheng, Xu Jinxiang, Yao Hexiang, and Wang Shangxian were not involved in the case and requested their release. The court approved the release of Liu and the other three. Lawyer Zhang further stated that the defendant Zhong Bingchu had been an apprentice at Yunji Fashion Company, owned by Pan Gentao, for five years, and his brother Jianchu often visited. One day, Jianchu borrowed 14 yuan from Pan and repeatedly failed to repay it. Pan then stated that the amount would have to be deducted from his brother's wages,</p>
<p>leading to resentment and arguments. Jianchu then planned to kidnap Pan's son Xiangxi for ransom. He had repeatedly waited outside Zhiyi Primary School, but there was no opportunity because Pan's child was always escorted to school. On the 11th of last month, at noon, the two Zhongs and Wang went to Dazhongli again and saw that Pan's child was not being escorted after school. They approached him and lured him away under the pretext of watching a circus. Unexpectedly, Wang Changfa and Shen Yongkang also went along. They first went to the circus, but it was late, so they took a tram at the Ma Huo Road intersection to Henan Road, got off, walked to Hongkou, and then took a bus to</p>
<p>Hongkou Park. The three defendants then discussed how to deal with the kidnapping of the three children. They had no place to hide them, and if they released them, the children would recognize them, making it difficult to avoid being caught in the future. They then decided to kill them. They took them to the wasteland of the Oriental Library and killed them one after another. They stripped off their clothes and pawned them, and buried the bodies in the rubble. Afterwards, they sent a letter to the children's families, saying that the children were in good health and that a ransom of 50,000 yuan was required, and arranged a meeting. At that time, the families of the three children were not yet aware that they had been kidnapped, only that they were missing. They had placed</p>
<p>reward advertisements in the newspapers and attached photos. Upon receiving the letter from the kidnappers, they realized they had been kidnapped. They then tried to prepare the ransom to redeem them. They entrusted Gu Rongde to open room 215 at the Oriental Hotel as a meeting place. The defendants then notified them by telephone, instructing them to first send 1,500 yuan, placed in a biscuit tin, to room 40 at the Zhongshan Hotel. Gu delivered the money as instructed. The defendants divided the money, each receiving 500 yuan. Not satisfied, they contacted them again by telephone, asking for another 6,000 yuan to return the children. After several contacts, they were sent another 1,500 yuan. However, Gu believed that the kidnappers had no proof, so he could not simply hand over the money. The kidnappers then</p>
<p>offered evidence, instructing them to send the money to room 33 at the Baxian Hotel, where they could see the evidence before paying. Gu took 1,500 yuan to room 33 at the Baxian Hotel, but the room was empty. He saw a watch on the table, which Gu recognized as belonging to Pan's child. Satisfied, he placed the money under the pillow and left. The money was swallowed by Zhong Jianchu alone and lost in a gambling den in western Shanghai. All the children's clothes have now been retrieved, and the family members and witnesses of the victims have all arrived, said the speaker. Subsequently, the children's mothers successively reported the loss of their children and identified the children's clothes in court. Seeing the items and thinking of their children, they were overcome with emotion,</p>
<p>and tears flowed.</p>
<p>The scene was extremely tragic. Then, Yuan Liangzhuo, a tea server at the Baxian Hotel, and Wang Keshun, a tea server at the Zhong Hotel, testified about the three defendants checking into the rooms. When questioned, the three defendants admitted to luring and kidnapping the three children and strangling them to death. They claimed they were driven by economic hardship and had no other options. After mutual arguments between lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Police Department and lawyer Tu Huaiqun, who was appointed as the defendants' pro bono counsel, lawyer Zhang stated that the defendants' actions were inhumane and their methods were extremely vicious, deserving the most severe punishment under the law. Prosecutor Tang also argued for a severe sentence. Judge Liu ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled sentencing for the 25th.</p>

<h3>Buying Voices Rise: Gold Market's Rising Trend Intensifies, Highest Price Reaching 5,775 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market situation for raw gold continued to rise, with stronger buying sentiment than before, so the rising trend gradually intensified. The tight foreign exchange market made people even more excited. Although the environment was unpredictable, hoarding gold was still the best strategy. Looking at the first half of the day, the morning opening was firm but not high. A certain money exchange firm sold a large amount, causing the price to reach 5,630 yuan. After the opening, it rose several tens of yuan but was thwarted and fell again. Afterwards, the tight trend of foreign exchange was quite good, and buying voices rose in the market, temporarily pushing the price to 5,775 yuan. However, securities firms and cash shops sold in the opposite direction, and the price immediately fell to the 5,700 yuan level. Later, the gold shops held on, and the market closed at 5,740 yuan. As a result, it rose sharply by 150 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Wednesday. The transaction volume for half a day was several thousand taels.

<p>Negotiated Peace Rose by 150 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each tael (ten taels), initially, with the foreign exchange market slightly tight, operators had a buying appetite, causing the opening to rise by 40 yuan. A silver shop bought 20 taels from a gold shop for 5,630 yuan. Afterwards, the demand from silver shops, gold shops, and securities firms was very strong. Although at that time, a certain money exchange firm offered a certain amount, the position was still insufficient. In the tightening of the foreign exchange market, the price was ultimately pulled up by another 55 yuan. A gold shop bought 50 taels from a money exchange firm for 5,695 yuan. After this, the foreign exchange market stopped tightening and tended to flatten, and the certain money exchange firm continued to sell, while buyers had gradually decreased slightly, so it fell back by 35 yuan. A silver shop bought 30 taels from a money exchange firm for 5,660 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange market tightened again, due to the widespread rumors in this city that a certain army had landed in Vietnam. But according to the news obtained by this newspaper, the French army in Haiphong had automatically blockaded the area to prevent that country from eyeing it. A buying spree rose again immediately. Silver shops and securities firms scrambled to buy, and before long, a certain money exchange firm also came to cover short positions. Soon, it soared by 115 yuan. A gold shop bought 20 taels from a silver shop for 5,775 yuan. After 11:00, buyers turned scarce, and the bulls from securities firms and silver shop sold high.

At noon, a securities firm came back to scoop in, and a gold shop also pulled in. Although a certain silver shop still had a lot to sell, it finally rose by 35 yuan. A silver shop sold 10 taels to a gold shop, closing at 5,740 yuan. As a result, it rose by 150 yuan compared to the previous day. It was firm after the close, and there were few sellers at 5,760 yuan. The fluctuation for half a day was 145 yuan. The cash shop's own brand of gold was sold at a higher price than raw gold by several tens of yuan, and buying in was reduced by 30 yuan.

<p>Jewelry Gold Shops Raised Prices by 20 Yuan in a Row</p>

There were no changes after that. As a result, Data Tongheng changed the quotation to 590 yuan. The new stores had the same prices as the previous prices. Buying in was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Most Snobbish Manifestation: Only Accepting American Dollars, Refusing to Accept French Francs and Annam Tickets</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market situation, raw gold fluctuated and trended upward, and British and American gold pounds followed suit. The supply and demand for British gold tickets were still balanced, and the market price stood firm. American surplus tickets once rose to 17 yuan and 3 jiao in the morning, and fell back to 17 yuan and 1 jiao 5 fen at noon. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that the British cabinet would be reorganized, and because the foreign exchange market and raw gold had no market on Wednesday, most people changed to buying American gold tickets, so the evening market rose again to 17 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, an increase of 5 jiao and a half compared to the previous day. Hong Kong tickets continued to fall by 1 fen. French francs and Annam tickets were again rejected by money exchange firms, so the market situation was sluggish. There was slightly more demand for Philippine tickets, and the market price rose slightly. The supply and demand for Japanese gold tickets was still balanced, and the evening market was still at 1 yuan and 8 fen. There was still a lack of demand for Korean tickets, and the market price rose slightly, with the evening market at 9 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Food: Speculative Rice Merchants Spread Rumors, Foreign Rice Raised to Extraordinarily High Prices</h3>
<p>The rice market suddenly recovered from fatigue and tightened in the midday market yesterday, rising uniformly by more than 2 yuan. The weather was fine and sunny, and people's hearts turned firm. If customers in Zhejiang Province and the villages are thinking of coming to handle it cheaply, the buying sentiment suddenly became strong, and the sellers seized the opportunity to turn profitable. The situation was already tight, and general floating hoarding retail investors specializing in speculation also absorbed from it, and at the same time, slightly released the profitable goods in their hands to mutually raise prices. Seeing the prices of various foreign rice rise again and again, the increase has been yuan in the market in an instant. And after the fiercer explosion, all the numbers that had fallen in the previous market were restored. After this, it seemed calm, and there was no recurrence. The result always only lingered between 3 and 5 jiao until the close. The closing prices were: No. 1 aged Saigon 59 yuan and 58.5 yuan, No. 2 57 yuan, No. 1 Siam 58.5 yuan and 58 yuan, No. 2 57 yuan, Fire-refined 58 yuan, Small refined Bank Shop 56.5 yuan, Pudong Shop 56 yuan 2 jiao, 56 yuan, Tokyo pointed 56 yuan, 55 yuan, Rice green 52.5 yuan, 52 yuan. However, due to the extraordinary congestion of new arrivals, and the continued large amount of ordering in later batches, the sales market was smaller than other goods, so it was uniquely without gains or losses. High-quality goods opened at 50 yuan, and then to 48.5 yuan. As for the afternoon, the rumors on the market were even stronger. If shipping was blocked, if there was a landing in Haiphong, and other rumors, they were all beneficial to the buyers. The blind followers bought one after another, the speculators took the opportunity to be active, the new hoarders handled the floating vacancies to buy, and the soccer ball business became more and more lively. The market price was raised higher and higher. And by the time of the evening market, each rice was raised by another 2 yuan. The small pattern Pudong shop was 57.5 yuan, and the bank shop was 58 yuan. Half of the No. 2 Saigon and Siam were 58.5 yuan. After No. 1 West bought opened at 59.5 yuan, it was again shouted to the high price of 60 yuan once seen on the market the day before yesterday. Fire-refined 59 yuan, compared to the previous night's close, all rose by as much as 3 yuan. However, yesterday's surge was really stimulated by rumors. If the rumors are denied by the facts, then its reversal must also be strong. New transactions: a thousand were completed before, small refined 500 tons to be loaded on June 28, priced at 61.5 yuan, Yu and rice merchants, recalled and opened 850 tons, No. Rice 63.5 yuan, and Saigon 62.5 yuan, Broken rice 54 yuan. Now 13,000 bags of foreign rice are opened.</p>
<p>Jing Domestic Rice: Yesterday, more than a thousand bags arrived in total.

It opened Jinli held yuan 54.5 yuan, Changdan white yuan 53.4 yuan, Jiangbei white yuan 51.2 yuan, with a unique increase of 2 or 3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Clearly Fixed, Secretly Strong: New Wheat Is Said to Be Arriving Soon, but There's Still Waiting to Be Done</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the plate of the No. 2 flour factory was still 13 yuan and 8 jiao, and the customer plate was 16 yuan 2 jiao half to 16 yuan 1 jiao. The market remained firm. The current source of new wheat has not yet been smooth, and the raw materials will be lacking. The actual sales in this street have increased due to the high price of rice. In terms of customer sales, the Nanyang gang's removal is also called Lien Chan. Therefore, each factory has gradually become unable to cope. The total transaction volume for each powder in the market is estimated at more than 13,000 bags. The market is clearly fixed and secretly smooth, and it is feared that there may be a realization of an increase in the wholesale price of this street soon. The supply of recalled goods and inland miscellaneous brands of flour is still rare.</p>
<p>Wheat: The source has not yet been smoothed out. Although it is rumored that the new wheat from the Beijing-Shanghai Road and nearby has been transported, according to the current environment, the arrival of goods seems to be smuggling, what is called each showing their divine powers. It is also rumored that a certain factory has received a certain amount and the combined price is a certain amount, which is difficult for those who are not close to a certain party to clarify, but there is no way to verify the father. Therefore, although the new wheat in various places has been listed for a long time, this port is not in a good environment, and it is feared that the peak period of surge still needs to be waited for.</p>
<p>Exports: The types of food transported to foreign ports include flour, 1,000 bags, and beans, 300 bags, transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Is Distressed by Rumors, Foreign Stocks Are Briefly Excited at the End</h3>
<p>Securities black market: Yesterday's market situation was again surrounded by unfounded rumors, and the rising trend was thwarted and turned to a decline. As long as the principal and interest are paid on schedule, there is no reason for the debt to shake. Generally, ordinary people disturb themselves, making it difficult for the debt market to raise its head. In the morning, Xinfu was released, Jiufeng sold again, Hongkang covered short positions, and Tongchang Yichang both bought. In the afternoon, Er'e, afternoon, Pianyi Hongda Yichang, and No. 38 all sold in succession, and Lianhe Dayu traded in, but the shorts still occupied the superior labor, and continued to see a slight fatigue. People's hearts were depressed, and the future was not easy to see well. As a result, it fell from a small 1 jiao half to 4 jiao half, and the total number of transactions was about 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 75 shares of Dasheng No. 1 Cotton Mill shares were traded, priced at 14 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday's public stock market was very stable, and there were few transactions until the last hour, when there were more buyers due to the tight and smooth exchange market, but soon after, the father turned silent.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Tuesday) Electric: Today's stock market quotations of British Merchants Sudo various companies, the Bank of Hui salt shares re-reported fatigue, British registered shares fell by three pounds, priced at seventy-four pounds, Hong Kong registered shares fell by two pounds, to seventy-eight pounds, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Tuesday) Electric: Today's list market of Chinese foreign debts, still reported flat, the top and bottom gears of various bonds were unchanged.</p>
<p>The 1940 dividend of British-run Li Han Automobile Co., Ltd. is scheduled to pay an interim dividend on June 27, at 2 yuan per share in national currency.</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower: Opportunity Machinery Listless, Yarn Market Falling Wind Intensifies: Shuang Ma Saw 1107 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to be tired, and the falling wind started again. This is because the European war has changed too much, especially making people's hearts flutter and undecided, so it is difficult for speculators to figure out. But foreign exchange has shrunk again, and gold has risen, but the yarn market has not risen with it. This is because the buying power lacks interest, and at the same time, the actual sales are not as strong as they used to be. In addition, raw materials are cheap, and the hoarders are watching.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened peacefully in the morning, but there were few buyers in the back market, and at the same time, the Guang gang's purchase of 20-count yarn was rare, and people's hearts were even more frustrated, falling straight to 1,100 yuan. Although the wind of foreign exchange shrinkage started again, the market failed to improve, still to the point of dullness. In fact, speculators suddenly lost interest, the platform was quiet, and the closing price was 1,107 yuan. It was found that the statistics of transactions in half a day, 1,470 bags, the price of 10-count Shuang Ma yarn fell by 39 yuan. Today, 985 pieces of yarn were transported to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gangkou is listed below:</p>
<p>Same Industry 1,180 Hong Kong 25</p>
<p>Ningbo 13 Mainland 1,470</p>
<p>Fuzhou 4 Statistics 1,470</p>
<h3>Market Observation in the Industry: The Cotton Market is Quiet</h3>
<p>Spot cotton transactions, both domestic and foreign, have completely come to a standstill. This is because the world situation is changing so rapidly that it is difficult to grasp, leaving speculators with no way to start. At the same time, the yarn market is depressed and overseas cotton markets are trending downwards, making price increases difficult. Therefore, operators are mostly taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>In other news, in the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market initially fell slightly due to selling pressure in the morning. Later, due to public buying and the covering of short positions by some speculators, the market recovered and strengthened. As a result, the closing price rose by thirteen to fourteen points compared to today. The Indian market was also relatively stable, rising by three rupees yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have been particularly sluggish in recent days. Transactions from all parties are quiet, all waiting for news from Europe. However, market sentiment is quite good. The factory delivery prices of yesterday's cotton market, converted at a US dollar exchange rate of 5.8125 yuan, are as follows:</p>
<p>20 count American Mid-lin: 300.500</p>
<p>Also, Lower Grade: 291.00</p>
<p>32 count, Again: 310.90</p>
<p>Also, Lower Grade: 300.60</p>
<p>42 count, Again: 112.50</p>
<p>Also, Lower Grade: 112.40</p>
<h3>Coal: White Coal Arrives Steadily in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Foreign coal such as Hongay and Tongdeli white coal, produced in French Hongay, Annam, is unaffected by the European war. Shipping routes are still operating as usual, and new supplies are arriving steadily in Shanghai. Yesterday, the Manchester ship brought over 2,400 tons of Hongay white coal from that area, which has already arrived in port and is being unloaded at Yangjingbang. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the source of foreign coal being cut off.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese and American Silk Prices Decline, Shanghai Silk Merchants Hoard Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American silk market declined. Near-term prices in New York fell by 5 cents, and long-term prices fell by 5.5 cents. Yokohama spot prices fell by 15 yuan, and long-term prices fell by 23 yuan. Foreign firms' buying prices also fell accordingly. Because the future of the European war is still uncertain, the market atmosphere is inevitably showing a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>In Shanghai's silk market, because there is still no definite solution to the export problem, silk from the interior is currently blocked. It is said that the new "donation" is valued at 12% of the draw, and will be levied in early July. However, there is no concrete news. Therefore, merchants are hoarding goods, and most silk merchants are unwilling to sell easily. Yesterday, the buying price for Chefoo silk was 2,150 yuan, but no transactions were heard.</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms' Tea Sales Plummet</h3>
<p>Green tea from foreign firms in Shanghai has seen a plunge because the cost has increased several times compared to the past due to increased exorbitant taxes and levies on sources from the interior, and the European situation is becoming increasingly tense. Telegrams of discontinued orders are arriving one after another from abroad, resulting in a slump in the market. Yesterday, only Harmony and Jardine and other firms purchased more than 70 cases of Chun Mee green tea, with prices ranging from 260 yuan to 275 yuan, a decrease of more than 10 yuan compared to the previous price. Currently, only one or two dozen of the city's hundred or so tea factories are勉力 producing goods.</p>
<p>In addition, 190 packages of tea arrived from Ningbo yesterday, and 300 packages were transported to Hong Kong today.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Unrest in the South China Sea Affects Cloth Sales</h3>
<p>Cloth sales in the southwest are affected by the suspension of the sea defense and Hong Kong lines, and rumors of Japan's invasion of Liangshan. However, the sharp contraction of foreign exchange is also a positive factor, so people are apprehensive, and transactions among peers have suddenly decreased. Stockpilers also have little interest, resulting in a slight drop in some cloth prices by 0.35 to 0.5 yuan per piece. However, due to exchange rate relations, exports have increased slightly. At the same time, domestic sales in various regions have also made slight progress. Wholesale shops on this street purchased more than 6,000 pieces of government cloth, foreign yarn, bleached cloth, and grey cloth. Zhejiang and Anhui merchants also purchased 4,000 to 5,000 pieces. Guangdong merchants purchased 100-plus items of colored cloth and fine cloth. Tianjin merchants purchased 100-plus boxes of blue cloth and Shilin cloth. Merchants from Siam, Singapore, and other foreign countries purchased 7,000 to 8,000 pieces of government cloth and various bleached and dyed cloths. Hong Kong merchants purchased 2,000-plus pieces of twill, bleached cloth, and government cloth. On the 20th, 82 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Sales of eastern cloth are still sluggish as before. Speculators are still inclined to sell, resulting in the market becoming increasingly depressed. Longtou fine cloth opened in the morning at 34 yuan per piece, but fell to 33.45 yuan. Four Gentlemen serge fell from 0.89 yuan to 0.8825 yuan per yard. At the close, the situation for serge was stronger, returning to 0.8875 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Raw White Sugar Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended upward with more buying interest. The association's盘开, spot prices for No. 24 raw white sugar at the warehouse were 70.5 yuan in the morning and 71 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of one yuan. Prices at external warehouses were 69.6 yuan to 70 yuan, and 0.2 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 0.4 yuan. Re-exported goods initially traded at 55.1 yuan, gradually rising to 0.5 yuan, and then further to 0.7 yuan in the afternoon, an increase of 0.7 yuan. Taikoo granulated white sugar B mark was 80.5 yuan, unchanged. Dutch red sugar was 59.5 yuan, up角. 本厂雪白 sugar was 70 yuan, up 0.5 yuan. No changes were seen in No. 1 crystal sugar and bright crystal sugar. A ship from the Chaozhou帮 opened with 120 packages of Zhangzhou Qing刁　, at 62 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals: White Lead Sheet Market Listless</h3>
<p>The white lead sheet market, which has been sluggish for a long time, still showed no improvement yesterday. Merchants from Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao and other帮 were rarely purchasing, and transactions from battery factories on this street were also small. Currently, transactions in the market rely only on the 门庄隅, resulting in a bleak market and weak sentiment. At present, except for No. 6 and No. 16, which are slightly firm due to a shortage of goods in the market, the rest have all declined.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Soybean Oil Still Weak, Raw Oil Mixed</h3>
<p>The underlying trend of soybean oil remains weak. In short, sales are not sustained and sources are plentiful, making manipulation impossible. Therefore, the narrow situation is difficult to develop. Yesterday, only ten barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded, priced at 98 yuan, a further drop of 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. 100 pieces of Yantai Qiqi soybean oil were traded at the original price of 70 yuan (听说 taxes are levied on oil transferred from Hongkou), and 100 groups of Dayou factory soybean oil were traded at 75 yuan. Peanut oil was mixed, mostly depending on the sluggish sales situation. Yesterday, the Hong Kong帮 continued to purchase 100 barrels of Jiangbei 本坊 oil at a price of 100 yuan. The street settled 200 barrels of Yantai oil at 90 yuan, and 10 barrels of Jiangbei 门庄油 at 94.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Origins of Rebuilding Jing'an Temple</h3>
<p>Jing'an Temple in Shanghai was built during the Sun-Wu period and was originally named Chongyuan Temple. It was later renamed Yongtai Chan Monastery, and the name was changed to its current name during the Xiangfu period of the Song Dynasty. Zhou Bi of the Yuan Dynasty wrote in a brief account: "In the first year of the Jianxing period of the Jin Dynasty, there were two stone Buddhas floating in the estuary of the Wusong River. Fishermen then found two stone bowls on the sand, which were all enshrined in the temple, and were quite spiritually responsive." It has been repeatedly destroyed by war, and the stone Buddha was once moved to Wumen. It is unknown whether it still exists. The temple has scenic spots such as the Red Crow Stele, the Chan Dynasty Juniper Scripture Lecture Platform, the Shrimp Pond, the Yongquan Spring, and the Green Cloud Cave. It has been repaired and collapsed repeatedly from the Yuan and Ming dynasties to the Qing Dynasty. In the late Xianfeng period, the four suburbs were full of fortresses, making it even more unbearable. Later, the monk Hefeng wanted to rebuild it, but was unable to continue due to insufficient donations and conflicts with the engineer. Only wood was prepared, and then a major famine occurred in the Northwest Province. Good people emptied their pockets to help with disaster relief, prioritizing what was urgent. Now, the villagers and monks of the temple are requesting to complete the unfinished work. However, the project is large, and it depends on the maintenance of the public. They are recounting the beginning and end of the temple construction, as well as the reasons for the suspension of the work in recent years, in order to broaden good relationships and demonstrate public trust, so that the temple, which has been over a thousand years old, will be rebuilt, and the public virtue of all donors will be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Misdirected Libelous Letter</h3>
<p>A sealed letter from the Su Yuan Letter Bureau was delivered to the County Magistrate's Office. It was signed Zuo Liangcai, and it contained accusations against officialdom. The County Magistrate was furious after reading it! He immediately ordered all prefectures and counties to instruct the Letter Bureau that all letters to government offices must first verify the origin before being delivered.</p>

<h3>Death Rays Are Not to Be Feared</h3>
<p>— New Nan</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European war, everyone expected the belligerent countries to use some kind of civilized (?) weapons to fight. The fact is, the German army continued to use several new weapons - electromagnetic mines, flamethrower armored vehicles, etc. Hitler, while using new weapons to fight, also threatened to use another new weapon; so everyone thought back to the long-heard but not-yet-used "death ray."</p>
<p>"Death ray" is said to be a kind of short-wave light, the light wave of which is even shorter than X-rays; because it is known from theory that the shorter the light wave, the greater the energy it contains, that is, the greater the destructive power to the body when it is shot on the body. We know that X-rays must be taken by a doctor: on the one hand, because only doctors can use X-rays to check for defects in the body; on the other hand, because the time of X-ray irradiation is closely related to the physique. In other words: X-rays cannot be irradiated on the human body for too long, otherwise there will be unexpected damage, especially to the eyes. X-rays with longer light waves are still like this, let alone "death rays" with much shorter light waves?</p>
<p>"Death ray" is still a mystery, so the theory, although it seems possible, but whether there is currently a machine that can emit "death ray" is indeed a question. So some people say that this is impossible, it is the boasting of idiots. In fact, there is no need to be like this, because according to leaked news, German scientists have indeed invented a kind of light, and have used it to kill a mouse, it is said that the result is very satisfactory; but we do not know whether this kind of light has been tried on humans, whether on-site experiments have been done in front of thousands of people. Maybe it can only kill small animals and not people, maybe it can only kill one or two people and not thousands of people.</p>
<p>According to recent news from the United States, the German "death ray" can only make people temporarily comatose, not kill people, so it is a very humane "weapon". In fact, since it is a "weapon", there is no distinction between humane and inhumane at all; unless the shells fired are bread, the bullets are candy, and the "death ray" is a lighting product. But then again, although "death ray" is inhumane, it is certainly not very scary in fact: to use X-rays indoors to specifically examine a person's body costs more than ten yuan in Shanghai, and the effectiveness of using it aimlessly on the battlefield will certainly be much reduced; so I think that using "death ray" to kill thousands of people, the consumption must also be very large. At the same time, when attacking, emitting "death ray" will probably inevitably not affect the food left by the enemy - whether animal or vegetable. So the attacking army has to carry a lot of food with them. So wanting to use "death ray" to step up the attack is actually probably difficult to achieve. Therefore, now we do not discuss whether "death ray" has been invented, we always think that even if there is "death ray", its ability must be limited and not to be feared.</p>

<h3>Drought</h3>
<p>— Zhuo</p>
<p>Eating rice at fifty or sixty yuan a担 in Shanghai is the work of rice weevils. The hometown, which is known for producing rice, has recently seen the price of rice also rise to more than fifty yuan a 担, which makes me feel a little strange. When I received a letter, I suddenly understood. The letter said: "Recently, the price of rice in my hometown has risen sharply to fifty-three yuan a 担. This price is probably about the same as in Shanghai, right? And it hasn't rained for more than two months. The water in the river is so shallow that the bottom can be seen. Early rice cannot be transplanted because there is no water. If it doesn't rain again, a terrible drought will come."</p>
<p>In the previous letter, it was also mentioned that the river channels were blocked by obstacles. ×× people, in order to prevent guerrillas, built small fences in every river channel. The water in the river cannot flow, and farmers cannot draw water. Moreover, the seasonal epidemics in the summer are expected to be particularly rampant. If it doesn't rain heavily in the next few days, the drought will definitely succeed. But in Jiangnan, which has already suffered enough from man-made disasters, how can it cope with natural disasters!</p>
<p>So, I think of rain, hoping for heavy rain.</p>
<p>When I got up in the morning, the sky was full of dark clouds, and there was a drizzle. I hoped it would rain heavily, the heavier the better. But this was just hope, and the sky slowly cleared up, and there was no more drizzle. When I went out in the morning to prepare to do my monotonous work, I wanted it to rain, so that I could feel some joy after the inconvenience of the journey to and from work, which I often recognized as suffering, but I was disappointed. The food stalls by the roadside were also talking about this, hoping for rain, and willing to lose their business. So I felt that my little sacrifice of inconvenience in walking was insignificant.</p>
<p>I looked at the fire, looking at the white clouds in the sky that were about to rain but not raining, I hoped it would rain, let those food stalls temporarily lose their business, and let me get some joy after the inconvenience of walking, which I felt was suffering!</p>
<p>But the rich young masters and ladies living in the midst of bright lights and fine wines do not feel those things.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's End</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Two "A Page of History!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne slowly asked: "When did you know that she was dancing?"</p>
<p>The old man thought for a while and said, "In the autumn of the year before last, she wrote a letter to the countryside and sent me fifty yuan, asking me to come to Shanghai for a visit. When I arrived here, I found out that as soon as she arrived in Shanghai, she didn't go to any factory, but followed Zhaodi to learn to dance. Zhaodi was also a dancer. Telling us she was working was just a lie to us country people. At that time, Lilan had just turned twenty and was selected as the dancing queen. A group of frivolous teenagers in Shanghai were crazy about her. She was so happy that she specially asked me to come to Shanghai for a visit."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said: "Have you been here from that time until now?"</p>
<p>Li Zhiban shook his head. "No, I'm not used to this kind of life - maybe I don't have the luck. After staying for ten days, I went back to the countryside. This time she wrote another letter asking me to come to Shanghai. I still arrived on the 11th and it has been eight days today. The house here is much bigger than before, and her scene is much wider, but I'm still not used to it. I originally planned to go back to the countryside in another two or three days, but who would have thought that this would happen last night."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded, thought for a while, and said, "Now, please tell me what happened last night."</p>
<p>Li Zhiban said: "I don't quite understand either. Lilan had dinner outside last night - in fact, this time I have been here for eight days, and she only had dinner with me at home once. After I ate dinner alone, I read a newspaper in this room, and then flipped through those picture books. Around ten o'clock, it rained, so I went upstairs to sleep - alas, I forgot my pipe here."

<h3>Life: The True Meaning of Life</h3>
<p>— Zhang Jun</p>
<p>Many young people often say this: "We are really born at the wrong time. If we were born earlier, the country might be more peaceful, and we could enjoy the blessings of working at sunrise and resting at sunset; if we were born later, the country might have already completed its nation-building, and we could enjoy the blessings of the people ruling, owning, and enjoying the Three People's Principles. But, young people; maybe you will enjoy the blessings, but the true meaning of life will also be reduced at the same time."</p>
<p>What is the true meaning of life? Simply put, it is "creation" and "struggle". All the environments of enjoying blessings are most likely to reduce the ability to create and the mood to struggle. In an ordinary and unremarkable environment, you can't do anything earth-shattering or touching. What is the true meaning of passing your life in vain?</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing in life is having nothing to do; or having something to do, but it is too ordinary and has no value. People who love mathematics will understand that practicing familiar problems that you already understand all day long will definitely make you feel bored; if you suddenly encounter a complex problem and solve it after hard thinking, you will definitely be very happy and joyful. The current world is full of many problems waiting to be solved. The only fear is that you lack the ability, not that there is a shortage of problems. And these problems are very meaningful and valuable. Can you find them anywhere else in this space and time? Isn't it a unique happiness for modern young people to have a place to use their talents?</p>
<p>Lucky modern young people! Do not fail to live up to the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, seize the space and time, transform the entire world, and be a modern youth! Revolutionary youth! Fighting youth!</p>
<h3>Under the Scorching Sun: One Worry, One Joy</h3>
<p>— Written by Chen Haoxiong</p>

<p>Art Circles</p>
<h3>Sketches of the Tang Family Trio</h3>
<p>— A Han</p>
<p>In the history of Chinese drama, the China Traveling Theatre Company is indeed very meritorious. The Tang family trio of the China Traveling Theatre Company, Huaiqiu, Ruoqing, and Ruoying, have the largest number of audience members. Here is a brief sketch of the father and daughters:</p>
<p>Tang Huaiqiu's attitude towards theatrical work is serious and faithful. The lead role in the recent film "Confucius" is enough to prove this. He used to work with his father, Mr. Dixin, in his hometown of Hunan, and used his spare time to compile a副刊, write essays and short pieces, so he is also a literary writer! He studied aviation in France in his early years, but after returning to China, he engaged in the drama movement. He is already forty-three years old this year. The tone of his speech is a little old, and his figure and face are both slender. He and his wife and two daughters often use humorous dynamics to unfold the joy of family life. For example, if he wants to talk to his daughter, he doesn't talk to her face to face, but writes on a piece of paper, with the words "Dad" signed below. Just looking at this matter is very funny. Recently, the three of them, father and daughters, jointly starred in "Thunderstorm". Because Ruoqing temporarily participated in it beforehand, the box office broke the historical record of the璇宫. He sighed and said, "I'm old, I'm useless, my audience has been drawn in by Ruoqing!" In fact, his heart is full of unspeakable joy!</p>
<p>Tang Ruoqing... When she returned from Hong Kong, she said: "A comfortable life has made my body fatter!" It can be seen that she is a new woman with healthy beauty. Her personality is woven with enthusiasm and boldness. Regardless of whether she knows people or not, her attitude always gives people a beautiful impression. She said: "Besides reading newspapers, I have no other hobbies. But if I have to mention one, it might be "义义 小麻将"." However, her stage art is indeed unmatched, but her mahjong skills are very childish, and she often draws eighteen tiles. She herself considers this to be the only joke.</p>
<p>Tang Ruoying... Innocent and lively, can describe her entire nature. She is currently studying literature at Aurora University. In her spare time, she often performs as a guest star. In "Thunderstorm", she plays Sifeng, which is very in line with her personality. At home, she raises many puppies, kittens, chicks, and ducklings, and plants melons, fruits, and other things. She said: "Her confidant companions are these small animals and small plants."</p>
<h3>Royal Palace Theater to Be Converted into MGM Ballroom</h3>
<p>— Leng Bai</p>
<p>The Royal Palace Theater, which opened this year, failed due to the performance of the Kui Deshe troupe, so it once planned to be converted into a cinema to screen second-run domestic films. Later, however, it had to be abandoned due to licensing issues. At the same time, it was rented to Fulu Shou Company, which came forward to perform Shenqu operas by the Wen Bin troupe. Now that the contract of the Wen Bin troupe will expire at the end of this month, the reporter has learned from reliable sources about the future direction of the theater.</p>
<p>The mainstays of the Royal Palace are Mr. He Wuliang and Mr. Zheng Wei Xian. Mr. Zheng is the manager of the Da Xin Ballroom. The monthly rent of Da Xin is 3,000 yuan, but recently it is going to increase by 3,500 yuan, for a total of 6,500 yuan. Therefore, Mr. Zheng discussed with Mr. He and decided to abandon Da Xin, convert the Royal Palace into a ballroom, and name it MGM. It is scheduled to start construction in early July and open on October 1st.</p>
<p>Originally, the site of the Royal Palace was the donkey racecourse of the New World. The donkey racecourse was moved to the south. Now, in order to expand the site, MGM has decided to cancel the donkey racecourse in the south again and include it in MGM's vision. Fortunately, Mr. Zheng is also the manager of the New World, so there is no problem.</p>
<h3>Competing to Shoot Folk Movies is Ultimately Not a Blessing for the Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Yi Xing</p>
<p>In the past half month, the company's preparations for competing to shoot folk story films have suddenly become very tense. This is a major change in the Chinese film industry, and it may as well be called a re-enactment of the history of Chinese films fifteen years ago. Its impact on film culture cannot be ignored. The reporter specially interviewed a prominent figure in the film culture circle who is currently retired to inquire about his opinions. The gentleman replied frankly: "Before criticizing the competition to shoot folk movies, I think we must first answer a question: Is it necessary for production companies to exist in Shanghai today? If it is necessary to exist in Shanghai today, the central government should send personnel to directly guide them. Otherwise, let them live and decline on their own, although there is no guarantee that this phenomenon will not occur. This is not only the case for film companies, but for all commercial combinations, this is possible." When talking about various companies competing to shoot folk stories, the gentleman replied: "I think that even if the current environment is not good, the path of production will never be so narrow. If you don't take this path, it doesn't mean there are no other paths to take. However, the fact that producers are competing to take this path certainly has his reasons: either for the convenience of production, or for ease of attracting audiences. If these two reasons outweigh everything else, then we have nothing to say."</p>
<h3>Random Notes from Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>"Guanyin" Filming Completed: Yihua considers its most expensive production of the year, "Guanyin," to be entirely completed. It is rumored that the first round of screening rights have been obtained by Heguang, but Xinguang believes that Yihua has a contract with their theater and cannot give up, so they are also vying for the premiere rights.</p>
<p>"Xi Shi" to be Previewed Today: Xinhua Company's film "Xi Shi" has taken nearly a year to produce. Zhang Shankun's emphasis on this film surpasses even "Diao Chan" and "Mulan Joins the Army." It is now largely completed and scheduled for a secret preview today. Besides director Bu Wancang and a few others, only one or two Nanyang film merchants are allowed to attend.</p>
<p>Golden Star's Debut: Golden Star Company has leased the Guohua New Studio, starting from June 15th. The first film will officially begin shooting on July 1st, directed by Wu Cun. The Golden Star authorities are unwilling to reveal the film's name, but the person in charge of Golden Star stated that it is definitely not being kept secret due to being a similar production to another company.</p>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA plans to hold a one-day broadcast fundraising event at the Xindu Glass Radio Station for the construction of dormitories. Students from various girls' schools in Shanghai will broadcast, and movie stars Chen Yunshang and Gu Lanjun, as well as theater actresses Tang Ruoqing and Tang Ruoying, have been invited to participate, with famous amateur opera singer Jiang Yiqiu in charge of the arrangements.</p>
