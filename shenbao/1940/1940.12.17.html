<p>紐約　海軍著作家漢森包爾文、最近在外交方針協會午餐席上演說云、擁有强大海軍及陸軍之美、日兩國、在地理上隔絕太遠、彼此均極不易給予對方以軍事上之病　、近時兩國情勢雖甚緊張、而歐洲局勢如無激變，日美間決不致</p>
<p>引起戰端　如歐洲果有激變、則日本亦當先行下手、包爾文氏關於太平洋戰略之陳述、可以簡括如下、軍略將側重於廣大戰區之全面、而不在某一地狹窄之戰塲、兩方用兵之基本因素，將爲地理及戰區可以利用之設備（如軍力及海空軍根據地）、太平洋戰爭之地理特點、卽長距離是也、此世界最大之大洋、實予兩國軍略以及政治、經濟以極大之限制及牽制、從西雅圖至橫檳最短之圖形路綫、爲四千二百英里、橫濱至巴拿馬之距離爲七千二百英里、橫濱至火奴魯魯一·四〇〇英里、火奴魯魯至馬尼刺四。七六七英里、至羅省二二〇〇里、美國地勢爲一整個大陸、中部有夏威夷、威克等島、爲</p>
<p>前哨拱衛北部有阿魯仙羣島、形如弓舷之端、太平洋之對岸、則有日本、其地勢一似英吉利、以島爲國之國家、須依賴海道之通暢、方可得重要原料之接濟、以維持其工業於不斷、日本之後方、有一大陸爲其後盾、與日本僅隔一狹窄之下關海峽及日本海、日本復有各外島爲其海中遠哨、卽台灣及正南之馬射爾及喀羅林羣島、該處距菲列濱甚近、且正當美國赴關島及菲列濱羣島之路綫、日、美兩國可用之資源及設備、極爲廣泛、惟距程太遠、兩方均不能給予對方</p>
<p>嚴重打擊美國之大陸各地根據地及夏威夷、阿拉斯加等、照現時建造程序、不久物可有充分力量、至關島則無所甩、菲島亦有甚强之防衛力、現有已受訓練之後備軍十三萬人、惟軍備甚感缺乏、飛機允稀、海軍除微小之亞洲艦隊外、幾等於零、至菲島防務、頗受下列各點之限制、（一）菲列濱遠處七千里外、並無交通上之「中　島」、（二）美、菲間之交通綫、須經過日本之委任統治羣島或繞遠道、（三）菲島垷有軍備、固將使日本用大力量始能攻襲、但最後必爲日本所得、（四）菲島之修理戰艦及供應隊之設備、不足供長期戰艦之用、（五）地勢偏僻、不利於艦隊之運用、至日本之形勢爲、一中國海岸幾全部在其掌中、（二）安南已受其支配、（三）擁有台灣及司潑萊脫米等島、照此大體上、美國完全控制</p>
<p>太平洋東部、日本完全統御太平洋西半部、故如美國不能運用新加坡及荷屬東印度各海港、則殊無伸張其武力於太平洋對方之可能、遠東方面來始無其他原素、如（一）蘇聯之海參崴軍港、擁有潛水艇四十至八十艘、（二）英國在香港有潛水艇、在新加坡有强大軍港，（三）荷屬東印度羣島、（四）澳大利亞及紐西蘭、倘英、荷兩國軍力能輔助美國、則美國果能向日本取攻勢乎、其間頗有三種可能之道、（一）長距離海軍對鎖、此事卽得英海軍合作、最後可</p>
<p>制日死命但須持之以久始能生效、（二）自南方經過日本委任統治羣島、向日本進攻、（三）自北方經阿魯仙羣島進攻、此兩路均甚困難、最後，日本方陷於對華作戰之困難中、而遠東局勢、終將視歐洲局勢而定也、（十六日合衆社電）</p>

<h3 id="c9">泛論國際戰禍的趨歸 <a href="#c9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>關於國際的軍事外交政治種種方面，久已成爲評述的主妥對象、分別申論，所言已多；今日請從另一觀點，就國際紛擾的基礎上，探求其一般的伏因，或者可以作爲讀者今後觀察國際的一種參考。</p>
<p>當前的戰事：從國際說，粗分爲亞洲中日兩國對抗的一局，歐洲以英德兩國爲主角的一局；從軍事說，中國一戰塲，英吉利海峽一戰塲，巴爾幹一戰塲，亞歐二洲外更有非洲的埃及與利比亞之間的一戰塲；從政治說，則北美洲的加拿大聯邦，大洋洲的澳大利亞聯邦，皆是交戰國。戰爭範圍旣可謂極廣了，爾後由此兩局而次第延擴更廣、，固屬意料中之事；况若昨晚　息，泰國與法屬越南間不但武裝衝突之不已，並且有由外交破裂而演爲戰爭的趨嚮、儼然行將另成一局。凡此大體情形，眞是人人耳熟能詳，無待多說。至於此二局或三局是否將因友敵縱橫，分野匯通而終於併爲一局，自是大謎，現在姑置弗論。</p>
<p>很難三言兩語的說明國際何以形成當前的局面。其間却惟獨中日戰爭是絕無僅有的例外，極單純，極顯明，祇因爲日本貪欲野心，對中國發動了武力侵略，中國逼不得已而自衛，於是有中日戰爭。蓋或有若干疆土曾在陳舊的歷史上迭相割讓而成所謂收回失地問題，若干同胞　淪於異族統治之下而成所謂少數民族問題，曾有舊恨宿怨而成所謂報讐問題，忽遭侮辱欺凌而成所謂雪恥問題，以對抗第三國的必要爲理由而有所謂設防或假道，問題以自然地理上的理由而有所謂重行書界問題，爲了條的文字上的疑問　實際權利上的懸案而發生爭持不決的問題，甚至爲了所謂杜防威脅的問題，爲了保障安全的問題，諸如此類，或有鐵證可舉二或有成理可言，或因見解之殊，或作敲詐之計，　眞或假，或疑是疑非，總之，每每因此而釀成國際戰爭；玫之悠久的歷史紀述，察之當前的國際局面，除了中日戰爭，此外的每一個國際戰爭，或每一部分的國際戰爭，若要說明其由來，皆得求之於上述的這些問題之中，分別的援用引證。然而這些問題難儘夠說明凡百國際戰爭所存在於國際之間的來因，却還祗是國際戰爭所由來的一面而已。另一面，戰爭的由來每每存在於交戰國的國內。</p>
<p>所謂存在於交戰國國內的，有如所謂資源不足問題，有如所謂人口過剩問題等等、在主動對外用兵的國家之統治階層，對於這些問題往往振振有辭，作爲號召其國民貢獻生命財產的根據。例不勝舉，然而往往萬難自圓其說；譬如競張軍備、犧牲了牛油來造大砲、這是浪費還是貧窮？又如中國人口的佔全人類四分之一，而中國疆域廣袤約佔全球十五分之一，則中國應否被視為他國所謂人口過剩的尾閭？即使資源不足，人口過剩，但因此而向他國侵略的理由能否成立？且浪費不自糾正，人口不自節制，充極其量，囊括了全球能吾解決其所謂問題至於永無問題？總之，磕破了國界，企圖以暴力向他國强謀解決自己的問題，則祗會造就國際戰爭的事實，決不會變成對外侵略的眞埋。當然。侵略者並不想尊崇什眞理，且否認眞理的存在；至於所謂資源不足與人口過剩之類的藉口，原來祇是用以掩護其發動國際戰爭之不可告人的內在眞因。例如好大喜功的侵略者，決不會自己承認爲了自己的好大喜功外立功立業始得維持其統治權的，決不自承爲了自維大權兵連禍結，雖至勢窮力蹙，識者共知其已無以為繼。而在窮兵　武者依然不知悔禍，這決不是知與不知的智慧問題，而是其內在問題的作祟。近代歷史造了許多先例。現代政治造了一條定律，即是：凡屬發動對外戰爭的統治階層，必隨戰敗而傾覆！往昔君主用兵或外。即使大敗而歸，祗要還能鎭懾老百姓，則帝王依然帝王：但是到了近代却不行了，一朝戰敗，非死亡即流竄其例亦不勝舉。因此之故，侵略國家的統抬階層雖知將敗。寗孤注一擲，同歸於盡，而不甘憣然改圖。我們與其期待他們萬一的悔禍，不如靜觀他們必然的沒落。質言之，侵略國家的統治階層不顚覆，則侵略決不已時，亦即侵略終止之日，必是侵略國家內變之時。這是國際方來種種變化中之顯明的趨歸。</p>

<p>關於貝當與賴伐爾中道仳離的原因，本報已將紐約泰晤士報的電訊，譯載昨報，茲再將紐的Herald　Tribune駐維希訪員上月二日的無綫電報告，譯錄於後。</p>
<p>紐的講壇報上月三日登載駐維希訪員愛立烏特一文，叙述前任法國副總統賴伐爾壓迫法國政府，促其帮助德義兩國對英作戰，此舉與法國日昨之閣潮，不無蛛絲馬跡可尋，爰移譯如下：</p>
<p>德國元有希特勒現正模仿法皇拿破崙一世的故智，擬對英作大陸的封鎖。他爲免蹈拿翁覆轍計，乃欲在德義兩國領導之下，建設「歐洲新秩序」並已把這種計劃，試探過戰敗的法國和非交戰國的西班牙了。</p>
<p>法國元首貝當上將前在法國淪陷區蒙都里爾與希特勒作歷史性的會談時，對於法德合作一事，曾在「原則上」予以接受。但據貝當事後宣稱，合作的詳細辦法，尚待從長計議。法國其派人士，對於此項合作政策，竭力擁護，甚至不惜對英宜戰。這派的見解，可在「圖畫週報」所載勒斯登一文窺見一斑。賴伐爾所辦的「箴言報」常常採用這種言論。其內容略謂，德國勢力日見强大，而英國勢力則日見衰弱，爲法國計，務須知所適從。法國倘不趕速與德國成立協定，則英國恐將捷足先登，屆時法國勢必悔之莫及。</p>
<p>這派人士還有一種見解，以爲法國及早與德國合作之後，或能在和議時獲得比較溫和的條件，恰如犯人在法庭認罪，希冀减罰一般。反之，法國如果觸怒了德義兩戰勝國，則本國領土且不免慘遭宰割。</p>
<p>但這種親德份子所最所顧慮的，就是深恐國社黨政府一旦崩潰，共產主義勢必蔓延歐洲，法國社會秩序便將紊亂不堪了。</p>
<p>賴伐爾就是這派的中心人物。當巴黎失陷，法國政府遷到波爾多，賴伐爾乘機崛起，號召國會議員，打銷法國政府遷往北菲洲繼續抗戰的主張，而建立貝當政府，以便向德國乞和。自去年七月以還，賴伐爾風鏖僕僕，一再前往巴黎與希特勒的特使亞倍茲進行談判。貝當與希特勒的會面，卽係這種談判所促成。維希內閣對於這决會面的結果，一致讚許，貝當且因而任命賴伐爾代替鮑多恩爲外交部長，德國各報咸認此舉爲報答賴伐爾斡旋國事之功。</p>
<p>但貝當本人對於親德派的信賴，究竟達到何種程度，這是一個非常重耍的關鍵。因爲貝當是決定大局的最後一人，種在廣播演說中曾說道，「這他合作，是我所主張的政策，各閣員只有對我負責。他日在歷史上的功罪，亦惟我一人負責而已。」</p>
<p>貝當後來曾接美國總統羅斯福一電，內容雖未經發表，但貝當一定知道，法德合作政策，必將包括法國在軍事上援助德國一項，果爾則法美關係必將蒙受不利的影響。美國來日的友誼有裨於法國之處，不下於一九一八年美國所給與法國的援助，貝當自不能不顧及</p>
<p>羅斯福總統接見各報記者時曾稱，法國艦隊的命運如何，實爲他近來所關心的四大事件之一。當時的法國外交部畏飽多恩也曾堅決宜稱，法國決不聽任其艦隊攻擊英國。本來在德法談判停戰的時候，貝當早就堅持法國艦隊不應用作攻擊英國的工具，德國如不應允此點，談判就此破裂，亦所不惜云。</p>
<p>但貝當對於法德合作收策，却是率先倡導，他在本年十月十一日的宣言中曾說道，「戰勝者倘能約束其所取獲的勝利，則吾儕亦知如何克制自身戰敗之恥辱。」希特勒聞悉此言後，曾立卽予以嚮應。希特勒在蒙都里爾與貝當會面時，且曾極盡誘惑之能事，這種手段，與他於一九三八年九月間在貝許斯伽登和英國已故首相張伯倫時所用的一般無二。</p>
<p>不過貝當經過這一度熱烈款待之後，不免要反躬自問，這位「我的奮鬥」自傳的原著者，曾在書中說明法國爲德國的世仇，務必予以燬滅，何以此刻竟提出如此溫和的條件，不免覺得有些奇特吧。</p>
<p>講到賴伐爾的爲人，法國前任衆議員現任維希政府電訊檢查處主任蒙體尼曾談及他「逼宮」一段軼事。據稱：法國政府自波爾多遷往北菲洲一項主張，原爲勒勃倫總統與衆議院議長赫禮歐，參議院議長雅納南三人所決定。時爲本年六月十八日，即貝當向德國乞求之後一日。他們並計劃於决日離開法國。其時貝當方繼萊諾爲總理，力主政府不宜離開本國，致與勒勃倫等人互相水火</p>
<p>賴伐爾這時候也到了波爾多，就利用機會，聯合波爾多市長即新社會主義黨領袖馬爾格，和現仟駐西班牙大使貝德里，前任外交部長龐納，反戰派衆議員皮格列，親德派衆議員史考比尼及參議員樸德門等人，創導反對政府遷往國外的運動。他們强制逃集當地的各參衆議員擁護「留守國內」的主張，並勸告他們說，議員職責所在，自應留駐國內，與民衆同甘苦。</p>
<p>到了六月二十日晚上，勒勃倫總統又堅持耍立即出國，但貝當已令飭各閣員在决晨八時以前，務勿離開波爾多，同時要求希特勒在六月三十日以前，勿進攻波爾多，以便充分考慮停戰條件。</p>
<p>當天晚上，贊助政府遷往北菲洲的各議員及前仟總理達賴第前任海軍部長剛萊基，前任內政部長芒台爾，前任外交部長台爾博斯，前仟敎育部長才的翰等人卽乘坐「馬　利亞」號輪船開往北菲洲摩洛哥，赫禮歐和雅納南二人則未及同行</p>
<p>到了六月二十一日早晨，主張留國各議員，紛勸勒勃倫總統和赫禮歐雅納南三人，打銷原議，賴伐爾也偕馬爾格，貝德里，龐納及皮格列等人都來勸阻。</p>
<p>當時賴伐爾首先說道，「我們此來係反對閣下出國，閣下不能出國，且不應出國。我們不能承認捨本逐末在菲洲繼續作戰無補實際的政府。」重要的閣員和參衆兩院議長倘使一同出走，所餘閣員便不能代表國家，毫無權力可言了。「一位共和國總統，携帶國璽，搬走了法國政府。他將被國人視爲霸持政權的罪人。國人都不滿「邱吉爾—萊諾」的聯合陣綫。閣下是吾將利用遷往菲洲的方式，恢復這種政策？我不能容許你有這種權利。如果戰事可以繼續的話，也惟有魏剛將軍和貝富上將纔有發言的資格。這兩位宿將倘使都承認有停戰必要，我們必須唯命是從。離開法國並非拯救法國呀！</p>
<p>勒勃倫總統聽了這番議論，怔了好半嚮，纔說道，「在敵軍威脅之下，時時有被俘的危險，這個政府怎能維持主權和自由呢？」</p>
<p>賴伐爾咆哮地答道，「閣下此際倘若離開法國，日後請勿再踏進國門一步。全國都知道閣下在國家存亡絕續之交，選擇出亡的一途，衆口一辭將稱閣下爲叛國了。我現在告訴閣下，我赴湯蹈火，在所不辭。倘閣下定要出國，權在閣下，但閣下必須以平民資格出國。請辭職罷。」</p>
<p>這時賴伐爾又傾斜着身，輕蔑地向總統說道，「不要再聽信那些陷害國家之流吧！你爲什麼追隨他們如此之久呢？</p>
<p>勒勃倫慘然答道，「我的職責是憲法規定的。」於是賴伐爾又喊道，「那些危害法國的東西，我都恨之入骨。」</p>
<p>賴伐爾說完之後，便走出屋子，法國政府遷往北菲洲的計劃就此歸於泡影。—就在這天，貝當任命賴伐爾和馬爾格爲內閣閣職。法國歷史上，勒勃倫總統拒絕簽署的，此爲第一次。</p>

<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、漲風漸熾、英美金鎊、因亦猛漲三元、英金票呆定如故、市價站平、美金票步趨漲勢、晚市高至十七元二角、比上週六終漲二角半、香港票漲伐回平、新加坡票及坎拿大菲列濱暹　票等均稍有需要、市價一致挺漲、日金票略有需要、晚市高至一元五角七分半、朝鮮票需嬰激减、市價回落亦速、晚市退爲一元三角二分、</p>

<p>公債暗盤、昨市依然無神、疲　略見安定、但交易仍無起色、人氣閒散、多數投機家父集中於金子市塲、故債市一時不致有鉅大變動、除非多方傾吐市價始能活動、昨日交易、鴻太買進的有二十餘萬、協康買進十萬左右、供方生大及胡鶴記較多、但以散戶又有抵補、行市稍稍轉强、其餘如昌記易中早晚始終賣出、聯和聯益稍有吸收而已、結果除戊種略小五分外、餘均微好五分一角至二角、成交總數仍祗八十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新亞藥廠股二百股、價爲二十九元五角、</p>
<p>衆業股市開盤卽堅、嗣因大衆買興濃厚、市况續形挺秀、實業股成交最夥、英聯　怡和啤酒·會德豐·鋼業及怡和紗廠等股、分外出色、橡皮股趨勢亦佳、</p>
<p>前傳在某信託公司樓上將有股票市塲出現、茲聞昨有中國股票推進會、正式成立、該會完全係信託銀行界一部份同業合作之組織、提倡正當投資、爲同業間介紹買賣之股票、皆爲正式註冊之華商良好股票、</p>

<p>紗市續升、且漲風尚烈、此因外　軟化、而投機人心良好、所以市盤繼續前進、惟有一部份因實銷不及上日之旺盛、傾向拋空、旋聞「外客方面」吸收之額、非但無出意、價格低落時不乏拖進、因之收盤時、浮戶無法應付、祇得照市抵補、情况乃由疲轉昂矣、昨有棉紗五自八十件運香港、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後人氣熱烈、開盤尚屬和善、始做一千三百二十四元買進者、依然踴躍、頃刻間漲至一千三百二十七元、旋因檯面搶空頭帽子之輩頗夥、一時籌碼鬆懈、情况轉向下降、跌破一千三百二十元關內、此時拋賣者異常擁擠、跌至一千三百十七元、在此一千三百二十元之價迥旋殊久、將近十一時以後、一般小銀號打來之電話、大都要進、一霎問漲風驟起、步步上升、直漲至一千三百三十九元收盤、半日間成交統計五百三十包、行情二十支雙馬漲十九元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>現棉情况安定、不及紗市之昂、此因海外棉價定價不高、所以情形不得追蹤紗市而上升、不過趨勢則穩固矣、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐的棉市靜寂、先因現貨商之賣出、續後又因多頭了結、結果收盤價格、較之上日跌落二三磅音、印度連同預測又跌二羅比、　滬埠外棉交易、日來殊呈靜寂之象、廠方購　淡薄、同業始終以市上存底不豐、路運困難而心意高昂也、</p>

<p>昨日油市、因爲十二月下交之期貨、生油始以一部份空頭、無貨交解、致全部交易頓見窒碍、市塲中祇有交涉聲浪、結果由所謂和事者公決、十二月下交之靑島生油、價作一百十一元結價、以了手續、如此投機多空雙方、均歸失利、以後一般慣作投機者、或可稍稍醒悟、昨現貨交易、尚有少數成交、行情平定、無爲軒輊、計開大連豆油二十桶、價爲一百零八元、烟臺生油五十件、價七十九元、膠州生油一百二十件、價八十元零五角至八十一元、靑島生油五十桶、價爲一百十二元、</p>

<p>曾任法官　新膺督辦</p>
<p>法國人杜格、年逾花甲、前任法會審公廨首席法官、現任特二法院顧問處主任、暨新任公董局政務督辦、來滬已十四年、現携眷賃居於白賽仲路二十四號公寓內之三十四號房間、置有六四一號自備汽車、用以代步、昨日午後四時餘、杜由寫字間公畢返寓、稍事休憇、至晚間七時十五分、赴友人之宴、外出酬應、遂命其家人、通知車夫，在外守候、準備出發、</p>
<p>突中三彈　均在要害</p>

<p>融五講經社第六次講經、首由沈　齡君介紹傅統先君講回教舆儒敦之同點、傅君爲約翰大學哲學教授、曾著有中國回教史、卽登壇講演　、回教本名伊斯蘭、這個字有和平舆順從二種意思，所以回教的宗旨、就是從聖人之言、順天命以求全世界眞正永久之和平、儒教听謂「君子有三畏、畏天命、畏大人、畏聖人之言、」可謂與此相吻台、回教的基本信仰、就是「萬物非主、唯有眞宰、穆罕默德爲其使者、」</p>
<p>直覺</p>
<p>我們可以從兩方面去認識眞幸、第一種是直覺的、是親證的、由直覺所體會到的直宰是「離言語相、離名字相、離心緣相、」的、眞宰之本髖、是不著於聲音·方所、不著於使終·有無、孔子說一祭如在、祭神如神在、」這個「如」字很足以表示這種境界、中庸裹面說、「鬼神之爲德、其盛矣乎、視之而弗見、聽之而弗聞體物而不遺、使天下齋明盛服、以承祭祀洋洋乎如在其上、如在其左右、」</p>
<p>理智</p>
<p>第二種方法是理智的、是人類所能想像的、由理智所得到的只是眞宰的大用和　現、由理智上我們可以知道眞宰是至知的、至能的、至全的、至善的、眞宰綱維理數、掌握天人、詩云、「天生蒸民、有物有則、」和孟子所謂「其爲氣也、至大至剛、以直養而無害、則塞於天地之間、」頗近乎這個境界、回教有五件具體的工作、來實現這種認識的、那便是念·禮·齋·課·朝、念就是一心念主、大學裏面說「知止而后定、定而后能靜、靜而后能安、安而后能慮、慮而后能得、」孟子也說、「心之官則思、思則得之、不思則不得也、」。禮就是禮拜、每天五次、孟子叫我們存夜氣、求放心、回教止是叫我們時時求放心、齋就是禁食色、並且還要不超妄念、不動　思、舉止唯敬、語默唯恭、課卽以所能而施之以濟不能、朝卽會其紛散而返乎其本之謂、道幾種工作都不外乎順主愛人以達到全世界眞正永久的和平，這也眞是儒家所應該做的工夫、」</p>

<p>— 止軒</p>
<p>據說蛇的過冬，是在地下用睡眠來渡過這嚴寒的冬天，所以有人兒做「冬眠」。</p>
<p>可是人呢？</p>
<p>半空中，有一面服裝公司的大旗正在飄揚，櫥窗內一襲襲時新的衣裳，令人貪饞地注目，想起了多麼合式；穿在身上像春來一樣的溫暖。</p>
<p>却有另一個櫥窗內有幾個大字，說：「冬令應該進補」。裝璜美麗的大的小的匣子和瓶子，都陳列在面前。這裏竟有驚人的力量，一入人口就使人强健得像一頭北極的熊，不怕寒冬。</p>
<p>還有許多事。有多少人，多少的心，正注意着臉上，皮膚，手和脚，更注意着冬天應該如何去享樂。</p>
<p>但却在街角發現一個襤褸的婦人，擁着孩子，抬着的頭正對着每一個行人。她身邊新添了一隻新的沙鍋。看那身後的一捲蓆子，怎樣去抵禦那捲來的北風？</p>
<p>蛇的過冬只須在地下睡眠。但她呢？她却是一個人！</p>

<p>— 蒲風</p>
<p>我愛我的家庭。</p>
<p>在我的家庭裏，終年，有和熙的陽光溫暖着，終年充滿着活潑的空氣。</p>
<p>人不多：爸，媽，長嫂，妻，我五個人，還有一個女傭吳媽。</p>
<p>第一個該先說到七十高齡的父親，父親有一個未臻衰老的身子，精神　鑠，父親還有一顆强壯的心。幹了近四十年的敎育工作，在他的經歷裏，有不少珍貴的史料。他眼見革命種子萌芽，遜淸的覆亡，五四時代蓬勃的情形。他會憑歷史的推演來昭示我們民族的展望，他有非常堅定的信心。母親，慈祥的母親對於處理家政是很幹練的。妻太年靑了，母親就執管大部份的家庭的瑣事。嫂子是小敎人員，她辛勤地愉快地從事敎育孩子的工作。大哥死了近　十年，她把她的熱情，她的愛，獻給神聖的敎育了。但在家庭裏，她是我們一份子，她供給不少的助力。她還有音樂天才，晚上她時常把十指轉動在琴鍵上，而我們的心，也時常神馳在輕快的夜曲的旋律中。妻是一個童心未泯，多少還帶點頑皮的少女：但一年來，在家的暖流裏，妻顯得溫靜起來了。處理家務，引起她很多興趣。白天，妻在某公司裏担任七小時的打字工作，在業餘，她是把大部精力，放在家政上面；她常常在計劃着怎樣使家顯得史美麗一些。我們結褵還不過一年，我們還沒有孩子——雖然大家希望有一朶小的蓓蕾，在這溫暖的花房裏生出來，帶給我們一份新的感覺。</p>
<p>每天工作完畢後，帶着一個疲倦的身子，回到家裏來。家的暖風，立刻把我的疲勞消散了。夜晚，在父親的臥室裏，我們熱烈地談論着時事。父親不時來糾正我們的錯誤，補充我們的論斷，但也時常接受和贊同我們這年靑一代的鮮明的理解。</p>
<p>在家裹，我們也時常勞作，在辛勤的工作中，我們常常得到無比的樂趣和安慰。妻同嫂子，時常幫着媽做各種點心。豆沙八寳飯，是媽的傑作。星期日，在我們的家庭裏通常是熱閙的。親友，隣居，這天的來客，就比平日多，有時候，嫂子招待一批小朋友，開一個音樂會，於是這小小的屋子裹，更白熱化了。</p>
<p>家庭的開支，我們有一種預算。雖然眼前的物價是飛漲着，但在有規律的盡力的撙節下，依然每月可有小額的儲蓄。</p>
<p>聯繫着我們的是：友愛，同情，眞摯，誠信，我們的愛交流着。</p>
<p>洋溢着光和熱，幸福和希望，我愛我的家庭。</p>

<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>（四）白髪紅顏</p>
<p>柳如是迥眸一看，見前面走着的乃是一位二十多歲的少年，生得英俊不凡，原來是昨宵在陳臥子宴會所見的江陰諸生黃毓祺。背後却是一個年近六旬，兩鬢斑白的老翁。黃毓祺見了柳如是，便大聲囔着道：「如是如是，你果然是個江南絕代佳人，今天我特來拜訪，且介紹位絕代才子大宗伯和你見見」一邊說，一邊指着老翁道：「如是，你道這位老丈是誰？哈哈，他就是虞山錢牧齋尚書。他的名望，他的才華，諒風雅如你，早已飫聞，眞是天下何人不識君呢。」柳如是一聽錢牧齋三字，如雷灌耳，伊一晌拜讀錢牧齋的詩詞，十二分的傾佩，以爲比較伊的恩師張天如凌駕而上之，且叉知牧齋字謙益，身任戶部尙書，又是一位廊廟　宰。所居虞山紅豆山莊，有兩株紅豆樹，可稱當今第一高才，私淑其人已久，祇恨未見其人，想不到今天他會紆尊降貴，到伊粧閣裏來的，這又是何等榮幸的事？連忙玉顏含笑，檢袵爲禮且說道：「小女子不知錢尚書和黃公子駕到，有失迎迓，勿罪勿罪。」一邊倫瞧錢牧齋年紀雖老，而精神飽滿，威儀隸隸，果然逈不猶俗。錢牧齋也對着柳如是作劉偵平視，頻頻點頭，目帶笑說道：「素聞芳名，知為塵世間奇女子，今日相見，果然不虛。」黃毓祺又笑道：「尚書，你一晌以爲今世無陰麗華，今日見柳卿，以爲何如？」錢牧齋拂着手中竹扇說道：「自有柳卿，人間粉黛無顏色了。」黃毓祺叉對柳如是說道：「昨晚陳臥子宴客，錢牧齋尚書本在被邀之列，祇因他從虞山坐船到此，遇了逆風，當大不能趕到。他渴欲一見芳容，所以陳臥子敎我導引尚書到此，你總該歡迎哩。」柳如是　然一笑道：「難得尚書寵臨，增光蓬蓽。」他們談話時，石達却托着大碗喝酒，旁若無人。黃毓祺和錢牧齋見了他，未免有些奇異。柳如是早把二人讓至伊的粧閣裏去坐。徐大娘和侍婢奉上香茗和茶盆，殷勤招接。錢牧齋見如是的香閨，華麗之中帶着文雅而不陋俗，沿窓書桌上放着文房四寳，左岡右史，卷帙琳琅，壁上也懸着好多幅書畫立軸和對聯，都是名人手筆，復社中人十居七八，不禁又點頭說道：「美具難並，雅絕麗絕。秦淮河邊，雖多粲者，怎及得此間柳卿呢？」柳如是聽錢牧齋稱讚不絕，芳心自然愉悅。陪同坐着淸話娓娓。黃毓祺向伊問起方纔所見的大漢是怎麼樣人。柳如是把相逢前後的事詳細告知。</p>

<p>敎育</p>
<h3 id="c95">性·性慾·性敎育 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 褐夫</p>
<p>性是生物界裏的一個很普遍的現象。如人類有男女的分別，男女的分別，在精神上已極顯明，在形體上更爲顯著。</p>
<p>飲食男女，本爲人的大欲，然而不可沒有節制，如飲食須有節制一樣。人都有性慾，而性的衝動，難以自制。依生物學及人類學的研究，知道吾人的性慾開始期，在懷春期以前，（人類的發育時期有三：：（一）乳兒期。（二）小兒期。（三）懷春期。懷春期的在十四至十七歲，男子始有精蟲，女子始有月經。）而性慾的發動在懷春期以後；故爲父兄的，應該在此期給以性的敎育，此種性敎育似又爲中學敎育家的責任，性慾自懷春期以後，有相當的展開，並且分爲三期：（一）則係指懷春期以前的小兒時代，名謂：中性期。在此期中，巳發生心理的性慾作用，並得觀察其接觸的現象。（二）則爲將屆懷春期的時候，名謂：性慾無差別期。此時表示性慾的方向，往往向種種方而搖動。（三）則爲發達期。此時對於異性發生追求，愛情等等。</p>
<p>十一月十九日麗芳女士在「被侮辱與被損害的」一文裏說：『我是一個「被侮辱與被損害的」人，但我知道這是敎育問題，這是這個社會制度下特有的必然的現象……。』的確，欲使性慾的節制，最佳的方法，須有待於性敎育的普遍實施。或鍛鍊精神，强固意識，養成自制的能力。同時瀏覽高尚的作品，屏絕不正當的書籍。</p>

<p>— 白狗</p>
<p>空襲對於鳥獸的影響是很有趣的。有些狗在炸彈爆炸時，會在奔好幾哩路。但大多數的狗尚無多大變態。那些帶進臨時避彈窟的貓，常常想回到老家去。在那裏嬌養慣的籠中籠鳥，要算是最不被炸彈聲所驚擾的了。快樂地唱着歌兒的金絲雀，被發現在瓦礫堆上跳躍着。</p>
<p>還有那小鷄們，對於爆炸聲毫不在意；咯咯而啼的火鷄，當飛機在天空飛過時，叫得更厲害。普通一般的家畜大多於空　莫知莫覺，在動物園裏，獅子和老虎叫得格外響，好像要喊出非常的聲調來。狗熊只管睡他的覺。企鵝好像什麼變化也不知道似的。</p>

<h3 id="c97">中國服裝中國道具俄語對白的「雷雨」 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 梁號</p>
<p>曹禺的「雷雨」，非但獲得中國廣大觀衆的讚美，（允其在上海，無論那一個劇團，那一次公演，都能滿座。）在國外，也頗受戲劇界的推　，秋田雨雀甚至根據這個戲而說中國戲劇運動的比日本還要進步。</p>
<p>在上海的「俄國劇團」導演普里裴特柯亞，在看過了「中國旅行劇團」的「雷雨」後，就決定把它譯出來，由自己的劇團演出。這還是去年的事，記者曾在璇宮劇院遇到過普里裴特柯亞及擔任翻譯的姜君，但是爲了翻譯工作的繁車吧，直到二個月之前，才聽釗他們開始排練的消息。本埠的俄僑對於這個戲的演出非常注意，無論蘇聯報紙白俄報紙都登載長篇的介紹文，介紹作者生平及「雷雨」的內容，可見這决演出的意義並不是僅僅爲了「中國服裝中國道具俄語演出」的新奇而已。但可惜這個籌備經年，排練二月的戲，祇演今天一塲（下午八時三刻在環龍路十一號法工部局大禮堂）。</p>
<p>「俄國劇團」的演員都是有十年以上的演戲經騐，普里裴特柯亞並親自飾演周繫漪，其他如雅諾夫斯卡雅及戈爾斯基分飾魯媽及魯貴等。這無疑的是一九四〇年「孤島」藝壇寳貴的一頁。最搜長，一齣馳名演火棍，（卽楊排風）滿城爭譽說閻郎。（年方二十二歲，正在靑年有為之際，前途遠大，望益加　力。）</p>

<p>名武旦閻世善，四决南下，三隸黃金，前兩决戲碼排前，多不爲人注視，後至者輒有難窺廬山眞面之感，湮沒不彰，識者憾焉。自今春改隸更新後，眞實藝術，始表現於公衆之前，其「楊排風」一劇，演唱數十决之多，蟬聯三閱月之久，可知其號　能力，受滬人士之熱烈歡迎也。六月底停演，載得榮譽北歸，歷時僅五月，又於秋末冬初，隨富運成劇團南來，此爲第四决；黃金台主，鑒於更新之成續，刮目相看，頗爲器重，屢與葉盛章演大軸，如「打瓜園「綠牡丹」一三岔口」等皆爲上决所未演，以其配角無人，而叉足徵其能戲甚多也。余觀「綠牡丹」一齣，其作派台風做工說白，則別具風格，均有獨到之處，可知其不專以武工見長，他若「楊排風」金山寺」泗州城」「取余陵」「殺四門。諸劇，美妙的打出手，花樣翻新，不同凡響，矯捷穩練，剛健婀娜，一舉手，一投足，武中有文，文中有武，蹺工獨步，允其餘事也。其藝術較前，益爲孟晋，余於觀劇歸來，喜而不寐，閃拈兩絕以贈。</p>

<p>民華在「孔夫子」完成之後，決作「久長之計」。而第二部作品已定爲費穆編劇德人佛蘭克導演。可是，民華除了極少數的基本人員之外，對付久長之計一在力量上似乎還不够應付。於是，他們決定招考新人，但爲了過去「照片明星」的多如過江之鯽，所以在投考的條件的限制上，是極爲苛刻的，甚至連已經演過電影的入，也在婉拒之例。然而，白雲却於這時候還圖活動加人民華，首先，他設法認識了佛蘭克，慫恿着佛蘭克去向民華當局游說，並且，白雲也一度到民華去過，可是民華對他的活動，始終沒有感到「興趣」。直到現在爲止，民華對他的滿腔熱誠，並無表示接受之意。這也就是白雲對外表示要　民華的始末。</p>

<h3 id="e1">President Roosevelt Hastens Return to White House; U.S. to Declare State of Emergency; Honolulu Fleet Updates War Plans; Expands Pacific Patrol Defense Range <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>President Roosevelt in Special Train. President Roosevelt, today embarked on his journey back to the White House, will confer with Secretary of State Hull to discuss efforts to aid China short of war, and the issue of constructing U.S. defenses on British islands in the Caribbean region he has been inspecting for two weeks. It is widely anticipated that the President's return to the White House will inject a new force into the rearmament effort, something that some national defense leaders believe has been lacking. Most people believe that aggressive action to increase defense production is imminent. Some close to the President even believe that the President may issue a proclamation declaring the current "limited" state of emergency as a full state of emergency. However, others predict that the President may delay this action and, via radio broadcast to the nation, place the entire country under a state of emergency. It is heard that the proclamation is ready and awaiting the President's approval. Political figures predict that Congress will break its post-election lull. It is believed that if Michigan Republican Congressman Hoffman implements his plan to break the three-day recess of both the Senate and the House of Representatives and strives to promote discussion of the national defense program, this plenary session will be more active. News regarding the second step concerning U.S.-Japan relations is also awaiting the President's decision. Washington political figures predict that after the President returns to the White House, the conflicting impressions created by news about the movement of U.S. fleets in the Far East, Tokyo's attempts to reconcile with the U.S., and the U.S. sending twelve long-range naval bombers and six submarines back to Manila, can certainly be clarified. Although the dispatch of these bombers and submarines to the Philippine Islands appears to be a rotation, people actually believe that this military equipment is indeed to enhance the U.S.'s position to cope with any emergency diplomatic negotiations. At the same time, the U.S. Navy Department announced that the U.S. Fleet in Honolulu has begun updating Fleet War Plan No. 12. War Plan No. 12 is to defend Hawaii from attack and at the same time prevent enemy forces from breaking through the defense line to invade the U.S. West Coast. Military strategists believe that this renewed war plan will utilize new military supply convoys and the convenience of oil tankers to allow the fleet to move over long distances, extending patrol and defense ranges beyond the 180th meridian to the Far East.

<p>Warm Springs. President Roosevelt, after inspecting the Caribbean, stopped here for eight hours yesterday. At the luncheon here, he spoke to the patients at the infantile paralysis hospital (founded by President Roosevelt). In addition to making several humorous jokes, he also said, "If the world doesn't sink, I am determined to come again next spring in March, for the customary two-week stay." This is Roosevelt's second important prediction in Warm Springs. The previous one was in the spring of 1939, when he made a surprising prediction: "If no war occurs at that time, I will come here in the autumn." The President's remarks today were made after a long telephone conversation with Secretary of State Hull and are extremely noteworthy. Hull's report seems rather pessimistic. (United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. According to Japanese newspapers this morning, twelve patrol bomber-type twin-engine aircraft have recently been transported to Manila. These aircraft flew to Manila from Honolulu. In total, the Philippines now has 25 U.S. bombers. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Roosevelt to Present Congress with Outline of Aid to Britain Issue</p>
<p>Washington. Yesterday, during a meeting of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the committee chairman, Bloom, made powerful remarks in favor of eliminating all legal obstacles to speeding up aid to Britain. He said that if Britain wishes to obtain loans for certain purposes, he would support amending the Johnson Act. Considering the current world situation, it would be best to abolish the Neutrality Act and allow American ships to transport supplies to Britain. President Roosevelt, after returning from Warm Springs this afternoon, met with Secretary of State Hull and may present an outline of the aid to Britain issue in his message to the new Congress, placing the responsibility for deciding on a solution on Congress. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington. The slow progress of the American military buildup plan has attracted the attention of political figures here. This matter was revealed by National Defense Advisory Commission Chairman Knudsen during a speech at a New York industrialists' meeting yesterday, causing great dissatisfaction among members of Congress. Five committees within Congress have announced that an investigation should be launched immediately to investigate the reasons for the slow delivery of goods. This was initiated by Republican congressmen, and Democrats also stated that military production must reach maximum speed and the government must take effective measures to eliminate bureaucratic obstacles to achieve maximum speed. Critics of the government's military policy advocate for the need to strengthen central control of the arms industry. Regarding this matter, thirty-four renowned professors from Princeton University issued a declaration, requesting President Roosevelt to declare a "national emergency law," granting the government the necessary powers to mobilize the entire industry for arms production to achieve maximum speed. Although it is not yet known what President Roosevelt will do, well-informed sources believe that after Roosevelt returns to Washington, he will take "vigorous action" to accelerate arms production.

<h3 id="e2">Soviet Union to Loan China 100 Million Yuan <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo. The Asahi Shimbun yesterday published an editorial criticizing rumors that the Soviet Union will lend Chongqing 100 million yuan, saying that if this rumor is confirmed, this approach is also expected. Although it must be taken seriously, it should not be regarded as a strengthening of Soviet aid to Chongqing, comparing it to the political and military plans of the anti-Tripartite Pact using British and American loans. The amount of the rumored Soviet loan is small, and its nature is also very different. It has not been heard that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov discussed the China issue during his recent visit to Berlin. However, Japan must at least maintain a calm attitude and observe the future developments in the relationship between Moscow and Chongqing. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Baldwin Discusses American Pacific Strategy; If Britain and the Netherlands Assist with Military Power, the U.S. Could Impose a Long-Range Blockade on Japan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>New York. Naval writer Hanson Baldwin recently said in a speech at a luncheon of the Foreign Policy Association that the United States and Japan, which possess powerful navies and armies, are geographically too far apart, making it extremely difficult for each to inflict military damage on the other. Although the situation between the two countries has been very tense recently, unless there is a drastic change in the European situation, war will definitely not break out between Japan and the United States. If Europe does undergo a drastic change, Japan will also strike first. Baldwin's statements on Pacific strategy can be summarized as follows: Military strategy will focus on the overall situation in a vast theater of war, rather than on a narrow battlefield in a specific location. The basic factors for the use of troops by both sides will be geography and the equipment that can be utilized in the theater of war (such as military strength and naval and air bases). The geographical characteristic of the Pacific War is long distances. This largest ocean in the world places great limitations and constraints on the military, political, and economic strategies of both countries. The shortest graphic route from Seattle to Yokohama is 4,200 miles, the distance from Yokohama to Panama is 7,200 miles, Yokohama to Honolulu is 3,400 miles, Honolulu to Manila is 4,767 miles, and to Los Angeles is 2,200 miles. The United States' terrain is an entire continent, with islands such as Hawaii and Wake in the center, serving as outposts, and the Aleutian Islands in the north, shaped like the end of a bowstring. On the opposite side of the Pacific is Japan, whose terrain is similar to England. As an island nation, it must rely on smooth sea routes to obtain supplies of important raw materials to maintain its industry continuously. Behind Japan, there is a continent as its rear, separated from Japan only by the narrow Shimonoseki Strait and the Sea of Japan. Japan also has various outer islands as its sea outposts, namely Taiwan and the Marshall and Caroline Islands to the south, which are very close to the Philippines and directly on the route from the United States to Guam and the Philippine Islands. The resources and equipment available to Japan and the United States are very extensive, but the distances are too far, and neither side can inflict serious damage on the other. The United States' mainland bases and Hawaii, Alaska, etc., will soon have sufficient strength according to the current construction progress. Guam is useless, and the Philippines also has a very strong defense, with 130,000 trained reservists, but military equipment is in short supply, and aircraft are scarce. The navy, apart from a small Asian fleet, is almost non-existent. The defense of the Philippines is greatly limited by the following points: (1) The Philippines are located 7,000 miles away and there is no transportation "midway island;" (2) The transportation line between the United States and the Philippines must pass through the Japanese mandated islands or take a detour; (3) The Philippines' current military equipment will require Japan to use great force to attack, but it will eventually be obtained by Japan; (4) The Philippines' facilities for repairing warships and supplying the fleet are insufficient for long-term warfare; (5) Its remote location is not conducive to the deployment of the fleet. As for Japan's situation: (1) The Chinese coast is almost entirely under its control; (2) Annam is already under its control; (3) It possesses islands such as Taiwan and the Spratly Islands. In general, the United States completely controls the eastern Pacific, and Japan completely dominates the western half of the Pacific. Therefore, if the United States cannot utilize Singapore and the harbors of the Dutch East Indies, it will be impossible to extend its military force to the other side of the Pacific. There are no other factors in the Far East, such as (1) the Soviet Union's Vladivostok naval port, with 40 to 80 submarines; (2) Britain has submarines in Hong Kong and a strong naval port in Singapore; (3) the Dutch East Indies; (4) Australia and New Zealand. If the military forces of Britain and the Netherlands can assist the United States, can the United States launch an offensive against Japan? There are three possible ways: (1) A long-range naval blockade, which requires the cooperation of the British navy and can eventually strangle Japan, but it must be sustained for a long time to be effective; (2) Attack Japan from the south through the Japanese mandated islands; (3) Attack from the north through the Aleutian Islands. Both routes are very difficult. Finally, Japan is trapped in the difficulty of fighting China, and the situation in the Far East will ultimately depend on the situation in Europe. (United Press dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The Hochi Shimbun published an article by the famous Japanese commentator Muto, stating that after this war, the friendship between China and Japan will regress by at least a century. The losses caused by this dispute must take many years to truly compensate and recover. The mutual hatred between the people of China and Japan is the responsibility of both sides. Most of the Chinese students who have studied in Japan have vigorously advocated anti-Japanese sentiments after returning home. This must be blamed on the poor training that the Japanese receive on a daily basis, because the Japanese therefore tend to hold contempt for their former Asian neighbors.

<p>Capital of Uruguay. The foreign ministers of Argentina and Uruguay signed a protocol after a meeting in Colonia, stipulating measures for military and economic cooperation, exchanging experts to implement military cooperation, and determining a long-term economic cooperation plan, which will be reported to their respective governments, stating the benefits of the Argentine-Uruguayan customs union. According to well-informed sources in South America, the issue of establishing naval and air bases on the Plata River has not yet been resolved. Brazil has issued a note stating that no final decision can be made on the Plata River issue without consulting Brazil. It is generally believed that the Brazilian Foreign Minister will participate in the meeting, and Paraguay and Bolivia, which also have significant interests in the Plata River, will also send representatives to participate in the meeting.

<h3 id="e9">General Discussion on the Trend of International War Disasters <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>The various aspects of international military, diplomatic, and political affairs have long been the primary objects of commentary. There have been many separate discussions of each aspect. Today, we will explore the general underlying causes of international disturbances from another perspective, hoping to provide readers with a reference point for observing international affairs in the future.</p>
<p>The current wars can be broadly divided into two major conflicts from an international perspective: one is the confrontation between China and Japan in Asia, and the other is the conflict in Europe led by Britain and Germany. From a military perspective, there is a battlefield in China, a battlefield in the English Channel, a battlefield in the Balkans, and, outside of Asia and Europe, a battlefield between Egypt and Libya in Africa. From a political perspective, the Canadian Federation in North America and the Australian Federation in Oceania are both belligerent countries. The scope of the war is already very wide, and it is to be expected that it will continue to expand. Moreover, according to news last night, not only has the armed conflict between Thailand and French Indochina not ceased, but it also shows a tendency to evolve into war due to the breakdown of diplomatic relations, seemingly forming another major conflict. These general situations are very familiar to everyone and do not need further elaboration. As for whether these two or three conflicts will eventually merge into one due to the alignment and convergence of friends and enemies, that is a major mystery, which we will set aside for now.</p>
<p>It is difficult to explain in a few words how the international situation has reached its current state. The only exception is the Sino-Japanese War, which is extremely simple and clear. It is simply because of Japan's greed and ambition that it launched a military invasion of China, and China was forced to defend itself, thus leading to the Sino-Japanese War. There may be some territories that have been repeatedly ceded in ancient history, leading to the so-called issue of recovering lost territories; some compatriots who have been relegated to the rule of foreign tribes, leading to the so-called issue of ethnic minorities; old grudges and resentments, leading to the so-called issue of revenge; sudden insults and bullying, leading to the so-called issue of vindication; the need to counter a third country, leading to the so-called issues of defense or right of way; issues of redefining borders based on natural geographical reasons; disputes over textual ambiguities in treaties or unresolved issues of practical rights; and even issues of preventing threats and guaranteeing security. All of these, with ironclad evidence or reasoned arguments, or due to differences in opinion, or as a bargaining tactic, or whether true or false, or based on suspicion, often lead to international wars. Examining the long history and observing the current international situation, apart from the Sino-Japanese War, the origins of every other international war, or every part of an international war, must be sought in the aforementioned issues, using separate citations and illustrations. However, these issues are not sufficient to fully explain all the underlying causes of international wars; they are only one aspect of the origins of international wars. Another aspect is that the origins of wars often lie within the belligerent countries themselves.</p>
<p>What exists within the belligerent countries includes issues such as resource scarcity and overpopulation. The ruling classes of countries that actively engage in foreign wars often eloquently cite these issues as reasons to rally their people to contribute their lives and property. There are countless examples, but it is often difficult to justify these claims. For example, is it a waste or poverty to expand military preparedness and sacrifice butter to build cannons? Also, is China, with a population accounting for a quarter of humanity and a vast territory accounting for about one-fifteenth of the globe, to be regarded as the end of the line for what other countries call overpopulation? Even if resources are scarce and the population is excessive, can the reason for invading other countries be justified? And if waste is not corrected and the population is not controlled, even if the entire globe is encompassed, can it solve its so-called problems so that there will never be problems again? In short, breaking through national borders and attempting to forcibly solve one's own problems by violence against other countries will only create the reality of international war and will never become a true solution for foreign aggression. Of course, aggressors do not want to respect any truth and deny the existence of truth. As for excuses such as resource scarcity and overpopulation, they are originally only used to cover up the hidden, internal true causes of launching international wars. For example, aggressors who are fond of grandiose projects will never admit that they are doing it to establish meritorious service and maintain their ruling power, and they will never admit that they are causing war to maintain their power, even to the point of exhaustion, when knowledgeable people all know that they cannot continue. However, those who pursue militarism still do not know how to repent. This is not a question of wisdom, but the result of their internal problems. Modern history has created many precedents. Modern politics has created a law: that any ruling class that launches a foreign war will inevitably collapse with defeat! In the past, monarchs used military force, even if they returned in great defeat, as long as they could still intimidate the common people, the emperor would still be the emperor. But this is no longer the case in modern times. Once defeated, they will either die or flee. There are countless examples. Therefore, even though the ruling classes of aggressor countries know that they will be defeated, they would rather make a desperate gamble and perish together than willingly change their course. Instead of expecting them to repent, it is better to quietly observe their inevitable decline. In other words, unless the ruling classes of aggressor countries are overthrown, the aggression will not cease. That is, the day the aggression ends must be the time of internal change in the aggressor countries. This is a clear trend in the various changes in the international situation.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Thailand Repeatedly Invades Vietnam; Situation Tense on Vietnamese-Thai Border; Four Towns Attacked from the Air, Many Homes Destroyed; Thai Artillery Shells Tongtong City Church, Damage Suffered; French Officials Claim Severe Retaliation Will Be Made <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Hanoi: Yesterday, an official here predicted that the French side would retaliate severely against Thailand's bombing of Vietnamese territory on Saturday and yesterday. It is reported that Thai aircraft launched eight decisive air raids on four towns, dropping over a hundred bombs, causing widespread destruction to civilian homes. The official stated, "Bombs are our only tool of resistance; diplomatic avenues were blocked on Saturday." On Saturday morning, when Vientiane, the capital of Laos, was attacked, seven Thai bombs killed one French soldier and injured two. Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux, before departing for Saigon this afternoon, commented on the Thai air raids, saying, "I do not believe that the Thai people are less fond of peace than the people of Laos and Cambodia. I believe the Thai government must ultimately comply with the people's desire for peace and reason." General Decoux, when mentioning Vietnam's readiness at any time to restore normal relations with Bangkok, condemned the Thai air force for resuming hostile actions against Vietnam after two days of quiet, stating that Vietnam would respond accordingly. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: The Thai government's Public Relations Department issued a statement saying that the Thai government is willing to resolve border disputes with Vietnam peacefully, and therefore hopes that Vietnam will send a delegation to Bangkok for negotiations. Thailand does not want to disrupt peace, and the Thai people hope that Vietnam can treat Thailand fairly. (Haitong News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: An official communiqué issued this evening stated that the Thai-Vietnamese border was relatively calm on the 11th and 12th of this month. However, in the afternoon of the 13th, Thai artillery suddenly fired thirty shells at Tongtong City in the Laotian province of Savannakhet. No residents were killed or injured, but a church and a priest's residence each took a hit, suffering slight damage. On the 14th, two Thai bombers and one fighter plane flew to Hue City and bombed it, resulting in one Frenchman killed and two injured, and two houses were hit and damaged. Soon after, three more Thai planes were seen flying to the city to drop leaflets. In the evening, two more groups of Thai planes bombed the city, but there were no casualties. At 4:00 PM on the same day, Thai artillery fired five shells at Savannakhet City, causing no damage. Additionally, two Thai planes dropped four bombs on the city, but because they were flying too high, only one bomb hit four local civilian houses, and none of the residents were injured. In the evening, the city was again bombed by three Thai planes, dropping about twenty small bombs in total, with minimal damage. On the morning of the 15th, Saravane City was bombed twice by Thai planes. Another Thai plane attacked the nearby airfield, dropping one bomb, but the only result was the destruction of a section of power line, which was quickly repaired. At noon, five more Thai planes dropped twelve bombs on the city, but only one house was hit and caught fire. (Havas Agency, 15th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: The Bangkok radio station broadcasted last night that several French people led a group of pirates and invaded Thai territory. Informed sources here have recently rejected this, strongly asserting that this news is either fabricated or based on inaccurate rumors. The reason is that recently, a Thai patrol opened fire on a team of Vietnamese, and they crossed into Vietnamese territory to dig for resources. They were all expelled from Vietnam by the French army. The aforementioned rumors may have been concocted based on this incident. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to news from Hanoi, France is preparing to peacefully resolve the Thai-Vietnamese border incident, continue negotiations with the Thai authorities, and approve the signing of a non-aggression treaty to show its goodwill. The French authorities are eager to demarcate the Thai-Vietnamese border and cooperate with Thailand. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: Hanoi and Bangkok authorities have both expressed their intention to restore peace to the border area. However, news of an unexpected incident was received today. According to an official communiqué, French troops opened fire on Prachin Buri's border with Thailand when there were no Thai troops in the area. Nearby Thai troops retaliated, and the French troops retreated. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: French aircraft braved severe weather last night to bomb Lak Muang and Kemmarat (both unknown), in retaliation for Qin's bombing. Qin's aircraft bombed Siem Reap in northern Cambodia yesterday afternoon. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Bangkok: The Thai Supreme Command stated yesterday that last Saturday, there was a brief artillery exchange on the Thai-Vietnamese border. Thai outposts in Aranyaprathet (transliteration) and French outposts in Poipet (transliteration) exchanged fire. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Vichy: The French Colonial Ministry issued a statement today saying that France believes that Thailand now knows the error of its actions and will restore normal relations with Vietnam. The statement said that incidents often occur on the border between Vietnam and Thailand. Thai aircraft have dropped bombs in various locations in Vietnam. The French government, with its determination to maintain the integrity of Vietnam, will of course retaliate against any actions that violate sovereignty and security. Therefore, the Vietnamese air force has also bombed various parts of Thailand, hoping that the Thai side will realize this. The Thai people are greatly disturbed by the air raids. The Thai government will understand that maintaining normal relations with Vietnam is greatly beneficial to Thailand itself. (Haitong, 16th)</p>

<p>Hong Kong: The Chinese military authorities in Shaoguan expect the Japanese army to launch another attack north from Guangzhou, so they have completed all preparations. The Japanese 18th, 38th, and 104th Divisions, as well as the elite Guards Division from Guangxi to Guangdong, totaling 80,000 officers and soldiers, are now gathering near Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta. This shows that the Japanese army plans to attack Shaoguan again. It is reported that the Japanese army's goal is to clear the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, that is, to advance from Guangzhou to Shaoguan and then to Changsha in Hunan Province. The northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, from Hankou to Yuezhou, is currently under Japanese control. Recently, there have been reports of increased activity by Japanese troops around Dongting Lake, preparing to attack south again. This indicates that the Japanese army plans to attack from both north and south simultaneously to clear the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. This strategy is intended to consolidate the Japanese army's position south of the Yangtze River and gain more strongholds in the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, and Guangdong. Clearing the Guangdong-Hankou Railway would increase the prestige of the Nanjing government and allow Japanese goods to be sold more easily in the most populous areas of China. However, Chinese observers say that it is unlikely that the Japanese army will attack again. The Japanese army stationed near Guangzhou is resting and preparing to advance south. These observers also pointed out that the Japanese army has launched two attacks north in December last year and April this year, but both failed due to the treacherous terrain and the tactical advances of the Chinese army. Moreover, the Chinese army in Guangxi is no longer under pressure from the Japanese army and can be deployed to Guangdong to reinforce defenses. This is also why the Japanese army will never try again. Furthermore, about ten divisions stationed in Guangxi and Guangdong have already returned to Guangdong to increase the strength of the Chinese army in northern Guangdong. It is expected that if the Japanese army launches attacks in Xuzhou and Yuezhou simultaneously, the Hunan army will rush to help, as they did last year. If the Japanese army attack materializes, the Shaoguan Chinese Army High Command will have to ask Guangxi for more reinforcements. (International News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Luoyang: On the morning of the 4th, more than a thousand Japanese troops from Qinyang, with many tanks, three artillery pieces, and dozens of light and heavy machine guns, harassed the area of Beishan Village in Zhangzhuang. After fierce fighting for several hours, the Japanese force retreated.

<h3 id="e20">Japanese Minister of Information Discusses New System <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: Ito, head of the Cabinet Information Bureau, stated this morning during his first reception for foreign news reporters that although Japan has implemented a new national structure, the functions of the Diet remain as before. When asked whether the Central Cooperation Conference of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which held its first special meeting in Tokyo this morning, was replacing the Diet, Ito replied that the Central Cooperation Conference was an advisory body to the Imperial Rule Assistance Association. Although it has the mission of creating better communication between the government and the Diet, it is not replacing the Diet. The Diet will continue to perform its functions as usual. When asked about the differences between Japan's new national structure and the political structures of Italy and Germany, Ito replied that the difference lies in the fundamental concept of the nation. He also stated that the launch of Japan's new national structure movement aims to restate the national concept of the national system, and there is no new meaning in it. In the past few years, the public's understanding of the concepts of the nation and the government has been lacking, which is why the new national structure movement has emerged. When asked if the Meiji system implemented in 1868 was a mistake, Ito replied that the Meiji system was suitable for the Meiji era, just as the current system is suitable for the modern era. When asked who will be the head of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which is promoting the new national structure movement, Ito replied that it will be concurrently held by the Prime Minister. Ito then addressed some newspaper reports that the financial situation was extremely urgent. Ito acknowledged that the current credit situation is not as good as in September and October, but since November, everything has definitely taken a turn for the better: (1) Since the beginning of this summer, the government has accelerated the payment of funds to industrialists; (2) Japan's foreign trade, that is, trade with the so-called yen bloc countries and third countries, has seen a turn for the better. One more point is that the regulations on restricting the manufacture and purchase of luxury goods, which were implemented on July 7 this year, have now been relaxed, so as the New Year approaches, the public is eagerly purchasing luxury goods, which is especially helpful to the Eastern financial situation.

<p>Berlin: The German economic measures for the past week (ending December 15) to improve the economic situation of the people in the German East District included the following: Deputy Minister of Finance Reinhardt announced in Posen that all war surcharges in the district would be exempt. In other words, people with an annual income of less than 3,000 marks are exempt from taxes. To improve agricultural production in the district, Dr. Darié has established a research institute in Brandenburg, including departments for animal husbandry, agricultural technology, and farming methods. Each department has a test field. A fishing school has been established in the city of Schak in the Warthe district to improve fishing methods. Fishing production in the district was three-quarters lower than in the old German rule. The area of lakes in the district is 41,000 hectares, and the area of ponds is 2,000 hectares, making it the most fertile fishing area in Germany. Last week, a production company was established in Danzig to help colonists acquire land to support their families. Sheep farming in the Eastern District has improved. Since the German transportation of sheep for crossbreeding to the area, 10,000 heads of sheep have been used. The experiment with crossbreeding has also benefited the wool industry. A conference of experts was held in Berlin this week to study methods of obtaining forage and food. The German Chamber of Commerce met in Braunschweig, and the leaders of the German Natural Gas and Water Company met in Berlin to discuss European economic plans and the supply of long-distance natural gas, respectively. Last week, German airlines added a commercial route in southeastern Europe, starting regular daily flights between Romania and the capital of Bulgaria. The company celebrated its 15th anniversary earlier this month, with a record of 750 ocean crossings, the highest in the world. (Haitong, 16th)</p>

<p>Washington: Britain's detention of Brazilian goods worth 700,000 yuan in Gibraltar has led to a dispute between the two countries. It is now reported that the United States is making every effort to mediate. Government sources revealed that Britain's detention of Brazilian goods, which were originally unknown to the outside world, involved German-made machinery and railway supplies. It is reported that US Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary of State Welles are making every effort to mediate, as the US government is deeply aware that Brazil's anti-British actions have spread to the entire Latin American continent, thereby weakening the Western Hemisphere's aid to Britain. Government sources also revealed that Brazil has appealed to the other eleven republics in Latin America for help in protesting this matter, claiming that it violates international law and is contrary to British guarantees. Reports indicate that the detained goods were the remaining part of a large batch of German goods exchanged for Brazilian coffee before the war, which were loaded onto the Brazilian mail ship Seguru in Lisbon on November 20. The Brazilian government stated that Britain had previously allowed the goods to be unloaded at the Brazilian Embassy in London, but Britain actually overturned its previous approval and detained the goods in Gibraltar.

<p>Cairo: Yesterday, the British official communiqué here announced that, after the British army occupied Sollum, the British blitzkrieg in the North African desert advanced straight into Libya. The communiqué stated that British aircraft continuously struck the fleeing Italian troops and the bases the Italian troops intended to reach. The British Navy's offensive was also quite sensational. It is said that British warships fiercely bombed Bardia, while naval aircraft bombed Tripoli, sinking an Italian submarine. It is reported that when several squadrons of Italian torpedo boats attacked a British ship, a fierce naval battle broke out off the coast of Libya. The British official communiqué continued, stating that the British Air Force also cooperated with the army, bombing the remnants of the Italian troops fleeing in all directions between Sollum and the Bardia Gorge. Sollum is an important city in northwestern Egypt, which was occupied by the Italian army in the summer. Since the British army launched its offensive, when this city was occupied, 26,000 Italian and Libyan soldiers, a large number of artillery tanks, and military supplies all fell into the hands of the British army. (International News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Cairo: War reports state that a British division launched a flank counterattack last night, penetrating entirely into Libya, threatening the Italian key point of Bardia, and creating a situation where the retreating Italian army was trapped. After Bardia was bombarded by British naval and air forces for several hours, it was engulfed in flames. British warships approached the Libyan coast, constantly shelling Italian troops and ports. Yesterday, the British army captured no less than 14,000 Italian soldiers and seized a large amount of military supplies. It is said that the large number of prisoners recently captured by the British army has forced the British military authorities to dispatch naval transport ships to send these prisoners to Alexandria. Among the Italian soldiers captured yesterday were several generals. According to unconfirmed reports, after being bombed for several hours, Fort Capuzzo has been occupied by the British army. It is reported that 40 tons of bombs fell on Tripoli. War reports state that the Italian army suffered a complete defeat on both land and sea. British warships can now operate freely along the coast without obstruction. When a British division crossed the Libyan border, it was led by tanks. It is said that on the desert battlefield, the corpses of Italian soldiers piled up like mountains. The Italian army's rearguard suicide squads are still firmly defending Sollum and Buq Buq, both of which are surrounded by the British army. According to unconfirmed rumors arriving here today, the British vanguard reached Bardia at dawn today. (International News Agency Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from the British army outpost command in the Egyptian desert, stating that the British army is currently advancing along the entire border, and the number of captured soldiers is quite astonishing and increasing. Italian trucks filled with captured Italian soldiers are escorted across the desert through wind and sand to the rear, continuously throughout the day. A British armored brigade that captured 14,000 Italian soldiers in the Buq Buq area is eager to continue advancing and unwilling to act as guards for the prisoners. Therefore, they telegraphed for reinforcements. Consequently, a large detachment of well-known Indian troops rushed to take over the prisoners, while the armored brigade rushed to Sollum to cut off the retreat of the Italian soldiers who had surrendered from the Italian camps in the desert interior. The last batch of Italian troops who stubbornly resisted outside Sidi Barrani were cleared on Wednesday. At the same time, another British armored brigade advancing along a slope parallel to the coast towards the old border made contact with the enemy on Sunday and is still engaged in combat. Large formations of retreating Italian troops were strafed by British fighter planes. On Thursday, thousands of enemy soldiers and hundreds of vehicles surrendered in the Niqayb Wahah and Sollum areas. Near a place known in the army as "Hellfire Pass," a unit of enemy soldiers quickly surrendered after being attacked in batches by British fighter planes. Last week, the Italian side attempted to retaliate with air raids. Five Gloster Gladiator aircraft of the British Royal Air Force engaged twelve Caproni aircraft of the Italian Air Force, destroying several of them. This has been announced by the British Air Force in its Saturday communiqué. The Italian army also put forth effort in combat. It would be a great mistake to say that they did not resist. The Italian army in Sidi Barrani had extremely fierce firepower, and when British tanks charged elsewhere, they were also bombarded by the artillery around the Italian camps, but to no avail. The total number of Italian casualties cannot yet be estimated, but it must be very heavy. The number of prisoners is also considerable. (Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian High Command yesterday admitted that the British army's offensive in North Africa has crossed the Egyptian border and advanced into Libya, and stated that the war is now taking place within Italian territory. Since the British side began its offensive, this is the first time the Italian High Command has acknowledged that the British army has advanced into Libya and that the Italian army has withdrawn from Egypt. According to the announcement, air battles over Libya are very fierce. It is said that on Saturday, eleven British aircraft were shot down over Libya. The Italian communiqué yesterday also acknowledged that Naples was subjected to three British air raids, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries. An Italian warship in the port of Naples was severely damaged. At the same time, the communiqué stated that the Italian submarine "Neghelli" operating overseas in Egypt launched a torpedo at a British cruiser and sank it. When mentioning the battles in Albania, the Italian communiqué only briefly stated that the Italian army's counterattacks had pushed back the Greek army in various areas, and that Italian dive bombers had heavily damaged the Greek army and its bases, causing heavy casualties.

<p>The British Army's Initial Victory in North Africa is Comparable to the Battle of Sudan</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from the Western Desert, stating that the reporter traveled along the 200-mile route taken by the British army's mechanized units when they began their offensive on the Libyan border. After two days of travel through the desert, they reached Sidi Barrani. After this long journey, they were able to understand the greatness of the British victory. Italian soldiers were not seen along the way, and the abandoned tanks, armored vehicles, trucks, and prisoners are now being escorted by the British army to their bases. The reporter also saw two Italian ammunition depots intact, each occupying two square miles. The scale of the depots can be imagined. Although the reporter made a long expedition, they did not use their own canned food, because they could find canned food left behind by the Italian army along the way. In short, the Italian army retreated in panic, without time to destroy various items. The elite troops under Italian General Maletti built a large camp in Niqayb Wahah, with solid defenses. The location was strategically important, serving as a base for attacking Egypt. The camp site was four miles in circumference and surrounded by flat-trajectory guns, field guns, anti-aircraft guns, and machine guns, with landmines set up on the outside. The defenses were extremely tight. There were 35,000 elite Italian desert troops in the camp, led by experienced Italian officers. However, less than two hours after the British blitzkrieg strategy was launched, this fortress and its elite troops were destroyed by a British mechanized division. With this road cleared, the British army advanced straight in. Seeing this camp site, the reporter felt even more that the initial victory won by the British army was as important as the battles after the Battle of Sudan. (Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>The Royal Air Force Operates Continuously, 27 Italian Aircraft Shot Down</p>
<p>Cairo: The British Air Force issued a communiqué yesterday stating that the British Air Force had shot down another 26 Italian aircraft. British aircraft attacked the Italian aircraft landing grounds and airfields on the front lines in batches. Bardia was bombed fiercely. At that time, 50 Caproni Italian aircraft were patrolling over Bardia, but they failed to prevent the bombers from dropping bombs, causing heavy damage on the ground. Two Italian aircraft were destroyed, and many others were severely damaged. A British fighter squadron operating with the vanguard of the British army shot down 14 Savoia aircraft and four Caproni aircraft of the Italian Air Force. Other British squadrons also shot down three of these two types of Italian aircraft. Only three British aircraft did not return, one of which may have landed safely within the British lines. On the 10th of this month, British bombers raided the ports of Croton and Tripoli at night, hitting two ships. (Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Border news from Struga recently stated that the brave and forward-advancing Greek troops, in a fierce assault, entered Tepelenë, a strong Italian stronghold in southern Albania, at 10:00 AM today. Another Greek unit has occupied Himarë along the coast. Himarë is the second military base north of Palermë and a major Italian landing point, serving as the gateway to Vlorë. It is reported that the Greek army occupied Himarë this morning after a terrible battle. In the bloody bayonet fighting, the bodies of many Italian soldiers were pierced by the cold, gleaming bayonets of the Greek army. This was a terrible martial drama during the occupation of Himarë. It is reported that the Greek vanguard entering Tepelenë has occupied several streets in the western district of the city. As the Italian army is still resisting stubbornly, street fighting is still ongoing. (United Press Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Athens: The Greek army actively put pressure on the Italian lines in Southern Albania last night. Rumor has it that if the Italian army can defend Vlorë long enough to withdraw its entire army, the Italian High Command is preparing to make a Dunkirk-style retreat through Vlorë. Captured Italian officers said that the Italian army is currently rushing to build temporary fortifications in an effort to defend Vlorë in order to cover the Italian army's general retreat into Italian territory. Yesterday, a column of Greek troops used encircling tactics to surround Tepelenë on both sides in order to capture a certain important village on the highway between Tepelenë and Vlorë. As a result, the situation of the Italian southern front became even worse. The report that the Italian army on the 40-mile front from Mount Tomorr to Tepelenë began a large-scale retreat yesterday has been officially confirmed, proving that the Italian army on the southern front has collapsed. The Greek army has also captured thousands of Italian soldiers and seized a large amount of military supplies. News reports state that the Italian army has begun to abandon the burning city of Tepelenë. The weather was clear yesterday, and there were extensive air raids over the war zone. Military authorities indicated that the occupation of Vlorë would provide British and Greek forces with an excellent base for attacking the Adriatic and the Italian coast.

<p>London: A Reuters correspondent telegraphed from the Yugoslav-Albanian border, stating that according to two Italian soldiers who fled to the Greek army, the Italian army is experiencing a severe shortage of food and ammunition. They heard that Italy was promoting peace and that the German army had set out to assist its ally. On Sunday, the fighting on the northern front was limited to mutual shelling. Northwest of Pogradec, the Greek army has advanced one and a half miles in front of a certain important town. However, the entire front is currently experiencing heavy snow, which is hindering military operations. (Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3 id="e28">Developments in French Politics Are Closely Watched by All Parties, Marshal Pétain Recruits Experts from All Sectors and Will Establish a Political Advisory Body <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Vichy: Since the downfall of Laval and Pétain's reorganization of the French cabinet, people here have been full of doubts about the developments of the situation in recent days, questioning each other. The conclusion they have reached is that the royalists led by Maurras and the French Popular Action led by Baudouin are both strongly opposed to Laval. Baudouin originally served as Foreign Minister, but resigned due to disagreements with Laval. Laval succeeded him as Foreign Minister, and Baudouin was appointed Secretary-General of the Head of State's Office because General Pétain relied on him deeply. In this cabinet reshuffle, Baudouin, as Secretary-General, was listed as one of the cabinet members, concurrently in charge of both the Information and Propaganda Departments (According to yesterday's telegram, Baudouin was referred to as the Prime Minister, which was actually a mistake for Secretary-General. However, since this Secretary-General is a cabinet member and his position is above all the ministers, this is one of the most important points in this cabinet reshuffle). (Haitong Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Vichy: Marshal Pétain reorganized the government yesterday and ordered the dismissal of Laval, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, and appointed Pierre Étienne Flandin, the former Prime Minister and leader of the central faction, to succeed him as Foreign Minister. Laval was originally known as the "soul" of the Pétain government. His sudden dismissal has attracted great attention from all parties. Since its establishment, the Pétain government has been reorganized three times. The first reorganization in early September involved the external transfer of General Weygand, the original Minister of the Army. In the second reorganization in October, Laval began to concurrently serve as Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister in order to conduct various negotiations with Germany. The original Foreign Minister, Baudouin, was transferred to the position of Secretary-General of the Head of State's Office. Up to this point, the position of Deputy Prime Minister has been abolished again. Although this is a temporary measure, the position of Chairman of the Cabinet Meeting, which was previously held by the Deputy Prime Minister (before the establishment of the Pétain government, it was held by the Prime Minister), will inevitably undergo changes in the future. Therefore, at today's cabinet meeting, Marshal Pétain personally presided over it, and in addition to the staff, all the ministers who were not cabinet members also attended. This is unprecedented, because in the past, when cabinet meetings were held, all ministers who were not cabinet members were not allowed to attend. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Vichy: It has recently been learned that Marshal Pétain intends to establish an advisory body to recruit experts from all sectors to participate in it, so that they can contribute their opinions to the government based on their respective strengths and share part of the government's responsibilities. The details of this organization are still lacking at this time, and it is only known that it is of a temporary nature and will be abolished after the new constitution is promulgated. People generally pay close attention to the fact that Marshal Pétain intends to establish an advisory body immediately after reorganizing the cabinet. In July of this year, the National Assembly (a joint session of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies) elected General Pétain as Head of State in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the constitution and entrusted the Head of State with the responsibility of drafting a new constitution. However, this drafting work is, as Marshal Pétain said, extremely subtle and complex, and cannot be completed until France and Germany have signed a peace treaty. Therefore, the French government is currently governing only in accordance with five "decrees," which is actually a transitional political system. Therefore, it is expected that when the new constitution is established in the future, France will still adopt a bicameral or unicameral system, but there is currently no clue as to how its organization and powers will be. Theoretically speaking, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies stipulated in the 1875 constitution still exist, and the government still has the right to convene them when necessary. However, in reality, the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies are in a "dormant state" and can no longer actively participate in national affairs. Therefore, Marshal Pétain believes that it is necessary to gather experts from all walks of life and establish a political organization to provide advice to the government.

<h3 id="e32">Laval's Dissection <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the reasons for the split between Pétain and Laval, this newspaper has already translated and published the dispatch from the New York Times in yesterday's paper. Now, we will translate and record the wireless report from the Herald Tribune's Vichy correspondent on the 2nd of last month.</p>
<p>The New York Tribune published an article on the 3rd of last month by its Vichy correspondent, Eliot, narrating how former French Vice-President Laval pressured the French government to help Germany and Italy fight against Britain. This action is not unrelated to the recent cabinet reshuffle in France. Therefore, we translate it as follows:</p>
<p>German leader Hitler is now imitating the old trick of French Emperor Napoleon I, planning to impose a continental blockade on Britain. To avoid repeating Napoleon's mistakes, he intends to build a "New European Order" under the leadership of Germany and Italy and has already tested this plan with defeated France and non-belligerent Spain.</p>
<p>French Head of State General Pétain, during a historic meeting with Hitler in Montoire in occupied France, agreed "in principle" to Franco-German cooperation. However, according to Pétain's subsequent statement, the detailed arrangements for cooperation were still to be discussed at length. Some figures in France strongly support this policy of cooperation, even at the cost of declaring war on Britain. This view can be seen in an article by Lestin published in "Illustrierte Wochenzeitung". Laval's "Le Moniteur" often adopted this kind of argument. Its content roughly stated that Germany's power is growing stronger day by day, while Britain's power is weakening day by day. For the sake of France, it is necessary to know where to turn. If France does not quickly reach an agreement with Germany, Britain may get there first, and France will inevitably regret it.</p>
<p>This group of people also has a view that if France cooperates with Germany as early as possible, it may be able to obtain more lenient terms during the peace talks, just as a criminal pleads guilty in court, hoping for a reduced penalty. Conversely, if France offends the victorious nations of Germany and Italy, then its territory will inevitably be subjected to brutal dismemberment.</p>
<p>But what these pro-German elements are most worried about is that if the Nazi government collapses, communism will inevitably spread throughout Europe, and the social order in France will be disrupted.</p>
<p>Laval is the central figure of this group. When Paris fell and the French government moved to Bordeaux, Laval seized the opportunity to rise to power, calling on members of parliament to reject the French government's proposal to move to North Africa and continue the war, and to establish the Pétain government in order to sue for peace with Germany. Since July of last year, Laval has been tirelessly traveling to Paris to negotiate with Hitler's special envoy, Abetz. The meeting between Pétain and Hitler was facilitated by these negotiations. The Vichy cabinet unanimously praised the results of this meeting, and Pétain appointed Laval as Foreign Minister in place of Baudouin, which German newspapers recognized as a reward for Laval's efforts in mediating state affairs.</p>
<p>But the extent to which Pétain himself trusts the pro-German faction is a very important key. Because Pétain is the last person to decide the overall situation. He once said in a radio speech, "This cooperation is the policy I advocate, and all cabinet members are only responsible to me. In the future, the merits and demerits in history will be my sole responsibility."</p>
<p>Pétain later received a telegram from U.S. President Roosevelt, the content of which has not been published, but Pétain must have known that the Franco-German cooperation policy would necessarily include France providing military assistance to Germany, and if so, Franco-American relations would inevitably suffer adverse effects. The friendship of the United States in the future will be no less beneficial to France than the assistance the United States gave to France in 1918, and Pétain cannot but take this into consideration.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt told reporters that the fate of the French fleet was one of the four major events that he had been concerned about recently. At that time, the French Foreign Minister Baudouin also firmly declared that France would never allow its fleet to attack Britain. Originally, during the Franco-German armistice negotiations, Pétain had insisted that the French fleet should not be used as a tool to attack Britain, and if Germany did not agree to this point, the negotiations would be broken off, even if it meant nothing.</p>
<p>But Pétain was the first to advocate for the Franco-German cooperation policy. In his declaration on October 11 of this year, he said, "If the victors can restrain the victory they have obtained, then we also know how to restrain the shame of our defeat." Hitler immediately responded upon hearing this. Hitler, when he met with Pétain in Montoire, also used all his powers of persuasion, the same tactics he used in Berchtesgaden with the late British Prime Minister Chamberlain in September 1938.</p>
<p>However, after this warm reception, Pétain could not help but ask himself, the author of the autobiography "Mein Kampf," who had stated in the book that France was Germany's eternal enemy and must be destroyed, why would he now propose such lenient terms? He must have found it a bit strange.</p>
<p>Speaking of Laval's character, former French Congressman and current Director of the Vichy Government's Telecommunications Inspection Office, Montigny, mentioned an anecdote about his "palace coup". It is said that the French government's proposal to move from Bordeaux to North Africa was originally decided by President Lebrun, President of the Chamber of Deputies Herriot, and President of the Senate Jeanneney. This was on June 18 of this year, one day after Pétain sued for peace with Germany. They also planned to leave France on that day. At that time, Pétain had just succeeded Reynaud as Prime Minister and strongly advocated that the government should not leave the country, leading to conflict with Lebrun and others.</p>
<p>Laval also arrived in Bordeaux at this time, and took the opportunity to unite with the Mayor of Bordeaux, the leader of the New Socialist Party, Marquet, and the current Ambassador to Spain, Piétri, former Foreign Minister Bonnet, anti-war Congressman Piéguet, pro-German Congressman Scapini, and Senator Portmann, to launch a movement against the government moving abroad. They forced the locally gathered senators and congressmen to support the idea of "staying in the country" and advised them that it was the duty of members of parliament to stay in the country and share the hardships with the people.</p>
<p>On the evening of June 20, President Lebrun insisted on leaving the country immediately, but Pétain had ordered all cabinet members not to leave Bordeaux before 8:00 AM the next morning, and at the same time requested Hitler not to attack Bordeaux before June 30 in order to fully consider the armistice terms.</p>
<p>That night, the members of parliament who supported the government moving to North Africa, as well as former Prime Minister Daladier, former Minister of the Navy Campinchi, former Minister of the Interior Mandel, former Minister of Foreign Affairs de Tersac, and former Minister of Education Zay, took the "Massilia" ship to Morocco in North Africa, but Herriot and Jeanneney did not make it in time.</p>
<p>On the morning of June 21, the members of parliament who advocated staying in the country urged President Lebrun and Herriot and Jeanneney to abandon their original plan. Laval also came to dissuade them with Marquet, Piétri, Bonnet, and Piéguet.</p>
<p>At that time, Laval first said, "We are here to oppose your departure. You cannot leave the country, and you should not leave the country. We cannot recognize a government that abandons the fundamental and pursues the superficial, and continues to fight in Africa to no avail." If the important cabinet members and the speakers of the two houses of parliament all leave, the remaining cabinet members cannot represent the country and have no power at all. "A president of the republic, carrying the state seal, moves the French government. He will be regarded by the people as a criminal who seizes power. The people are all dissatisfied with the 'Churchill-Reynaud' alliance. Are you going to use the method of moving to Africa to restore this policy? I cannot allow you to have this right. If the war can continue, only General Weygand and General Pétain are qualified to speak. If these two veterans admit that there is a need for an armistice, we must obey. Leaving France is not saving France!"</p>
<p>President Lebrun listened to this discussion, stunned for a long time, before saying, "Under the threat of enemy troops, there is always the danger of being captured. How can this government maintain sovereignty and freedom?"</p>
<p>Laval roared in response, "If you leave France at this time, please do not set foot in the country again in the future. The whole country knows that at this critical moment of national survival, you have chosen the path of exile, and everyone will call you a traitor. I am telling you now that I will go through fire and water, and I will not hesitate. If you insist on leaving the country, the power is yours, but you must leave the country as a civilian. Please resign."</p>
<p>At this time, Laval leaned forward and said to the president with contempt, "Don't listen to those who harm the country anymore! Why have you followed them for so long?"</p>
<p>Lebrun replied sadly, "My duty is prescribed by the constitution." Then Laval shouted again, "I hate everything that harms France to the bone."</p>
<p>After Laval finished speaking, he walked out of the room, and the French government's plan to move to North Africa was shattered. On this day, Pétain appointed Laval and Marquet to cabinet positions. This was the first time in French history that President Lebrun refused to sign.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Berlin to the "Basler National Zeitung" in Basel states that it is heard from the German government that the military setbacks of Italy in Albania and Egypt will not affect Germany's military decisions, nor will they lead Germany to provide substantial assistance to Italy. Germany is still adhering to its plan to launch a final decisive battle against Britain in the British Isles. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London: According to the latest news from Ankara, Turkey, a Turkish radio station stated last night that according to news arriving in Ankara, German Supreme Commander Field Marshal Keitel advised Hitler to sever relations with Italy. It is reported that when Mussolini sent an urgent telegram to Hitler requesting a personal meeting, Keitel had already proposed severing relations with Italy. At the same time, the London Daily Express carried a news report from Ankara this morning stating that the air force attachés in the German embassies in Turkey and Bulgaria have already been recalled to Berlin. This action is the same as the foreshadowing of Germany's attack on Scandinavia. (International News, 16th)</p>
<p>New York: Former Italian Foreign Minister Sforza, who once led Italy's last legal and fascist faction, stated here yesterday that Italians are now tired of instigating politicians and miracle-makers" and yearn to find a way to break free from German control. The Italian army's defeat in Egypt and Albania, coupled with the growing unrest among the people, has made Count Sforza's name prominent. Sforza and the leaders of the People's Republic are close friends. Recently, Sforza met with reporters from the International News Service, expressing his contempt for the fascist system and believing that Italy will adopt a new political system due to public pressure. The Fascist Party outlawed all opposition parties in 1926. (International News, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e35">Breaking Three Days of Silence; German Planes Fiercely Attack Britain; Two Towns in the Midlands Suffered Tragic Bombings <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>London: Last night and this morning, Hitler's air fleets launched a large-scale attack on a town in northern England. Shortly after nightfall, the air fleets rushed into the fierce anti-aircraft artillery defense network and dropped bombs like hailstones. As for London, due to the intensity of the anti-aircraft fire, there was only a short-lived air raid. German air fleets, on their way north, flew over a town in the Midlands one after another, seemingly using the town as a landmark to indicate the route of flight. However, each fleet concentrated on the town for a short period of bombing each time it passed. London was attacked once late at night, but the German planes only dropped one bomb, which landed in a park, causing no damage. The air raid alarm in London was lifted before midnight. The terrible air raid on a town in northern England broke the three days of silence. During the three days of silence, British observers believed that Hitler must have used his main air force to assist Italy and other new offensives. The anti-aircraft guns along the southeast coast fired fiercely at the German air fleets passing over their territory, and it was reported that the attackers had also flown over western and southeastern England and other places. A large number of German planes flew over the east and south coasts, but the broad and intense anti-aircraft fire network forced the German planes to fly inland at very high altitudes, daring not to hover low. Many bombs fell on the outskirts of a town in East Anglia, but no damage was reported. Although there was thick fog in the English Channel yesterday, the fog was very low, and the upper layer of the fog was clear and the moon was round like a mirror, which was very suitable for flying. Two towns in the Midlands were tragically bombed. As usual, Germany first dropped incendiary bombs and then high-explosive bombs on the two towns. A town in the southwest was visited twice by several German reconnaissance planes and one single bomber, dropping many incendiary bombs, causing numerous fires, but the fires were quickly brought under control. It was also reported that German planes flew to Liverpool last night. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>London: The German air raid on Britain last night was widespread and ended quite early. London and a town in the northeast were free of enemy planes by midnight. Fewer bombs fell on London. Many incendiary bombs and high-explosive bombs fell on a town in the northeast, but the scope was not as large as the previous "lightning" attack. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>Berlin: The British Air Force raided Berlin again last night. It had been 19 days since the last air raid by British planes. However, the damage from last night's air raid was minimal. British planes flew over the center of Berlin. Anti-aircraft guns fired at the central planes after the alarm. The citizens of Berlin did not expect an air raid alarm last night because British planes had not been there for many days and because the weather was not conducive to flying. As a result, thousands of people in many restaurants in the west were restrained by the alarm and could not move freely, and buses, trams, and subways were also crowded with people. An official communiqué stated that British planes had distributed leaflets in an area outside Berlin. (United Press, 16th)</p>

<p>The fourth Shen Bao Cup China-America Charity Basketball Championship, co-sponsored by Shen Bao, the English-language Da Mei Evening News, and the West China YMCA, is scheduled to kick off tonight at 8 PM at the YMCA basketball court on Jing'an Temple Road. The Chinese and American teams will compete in a best-of-three championship battle. The strength of the Chinese team this year is widely recognized. The essence of all Shanghai Chinese basketball has been gathered. The team's spirit is excellent, and their cooperation is unprecedented since the Shen Bao Cup began. The Chinese team's strength was slightly weaker last year, resulting in the championship being won by the American team. This year, they have the greatest determination to win back this silver cup. The American team is composed of players from the McLane team and the YMCA, and their strength is also very formidable. When the two powerhouses meet, the tension will be intense, and it will be the season's unprecedented first exciting game. It is hoped that enthusiastic philanthropists and fans will not miss it.</p>
<p>McLane Plays Music</p>
<p>Tonight, the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment Band in Shanghai will, as usual, come to the venue to play music and add to the excitement. You can enjoy excellent basketball skills and listen to beautiful music, and at the same time do good deeds and create blessings, achieving three things at once. According to the Shen Bao Cup, all proceeds, after deducting expenses, will be donated equally to three groups: (1) Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, (2) Shanghai International Red Cross Society, (3) YMCA Christmas Orphan Party. Because the YMCA gymnasium has limited space, each game is limited to 317 five-yuan tickets (downstairs) and 410 three-yuan tickets (upstairs). The remaining tickets for the three days are not many, so it is hoped that you will quickly purchase them in advance at the Shen Bao office on Hankou Road and the YMCA to avoid disappointment.</p>
<p>Women's Performance</p>
<p>The game on Thursday night will start earlier at 7:30 PM. The third game on Saturday will still start at 8 PM. Starting at 7 PM that evening, there will also be a China-West women's basketball performance game.

<p>The 13th YMCA Basketball Tournament kicked off last night. Zhang Shaoqing of Paramount scored the first point, opening the first page of the great battle's history. Last night, Paramount performed extremely sharply with new players Yu Dehai, Tao Shaosheng, and Han Longhai. The champion's heroic style is still there. In addition, because the final battle is approaching, they still need to conserve their strength and did not fight with all their might. Zhang Shaoqing and Feng Nianhua successively scored, and Sun Damiao of Shangxing immediately responded with four points each. But after Tao Shaosheng scored, Feng Nianhua was ambidextrous, like a pearl rolling on a plate, scoring as many as nine points alone. Shangxing's Zhou Jun scored, chasing to 6-8, and Damiao's ten points chased to 8-10. Paramount took the lead in the first half with 21-17. After switching sides, the situation remained the same. As a result, Paramount won a winning start with 46-36. The final game was a self-consuming battle between McLane White and McLane Red. McLane White's performance was lackluster last night, and McLane Red took the lead step by step. At the end of the first half, McLane Red took the lead with 15-13. After switching, McLane Red still had a two-point advantage until the very end. McLane White chased to 27-27 and then took the lead with 29-27. But McLane Red chased to a tie again. McLane White relied on a final effort to sing the final triumph with 33-31.</p>

<p>(Leiyang Correspondence) In Hunan Province, various counties have established county-level junior high schools. Nineteen counties, including Xiangtan and Xiangxiang, have established such schools. Twenty-nine counties, including Liu, Yuanjiang, etc., have established county-level simplified rural normal schools. While some schools are well-managed, many suffer from insufficient funding and rudimentary facilities. Furthermore, due to the meager salaries of teachers, many hired teachers lack proper qualifications. Given this situation, improvement is difficult to achieve. The Hunan Provincial Department of Education, in accordance with Item 4 of the Education Section of the Provincial Government's Thirtieth Fiscal Year Policy Guidelines and Chairman Xue's instructions on education construction points three and four, given at the Party, Government, and Military Leaders' Conference, has drafted the "Hunan Province Measures for the Establishment of County-Level Junior High Schools and Simplified Rural Normal Schools." It was officially promulgated and implemented on November 24th as the standard for improving county-level junior high schools and simplified rural normal schools in Hunan Province.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Food: Hoarders Defy the Law, Foreign Rice Plays the Black Market, Selling Mixed Brands at Premium Prices - What Else Is There to Do Besides Black Market? Fixed Prices Are Counted On to Erode, and Rice Prices Are Bound to Rise Again <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The foreign rice market has become chaotic again. Since the continuous price hikes, although the Market Management Committee members strictly supervised and restricted trading yesterday, these individuals were unable to carry out their conspiracies and had to trade within the limits. However, for those goods whose prices had already reached the limit line in the previous week, holders were unwilling to sell, resulting in scarcity on the market. Therefore, most of what was offered yesterday was mixed-brand rice. For example, No. 1 Saigon, which was around 86 yuan the previous week, and No. 2, which was offered at 80 yuan, all reached the limit price yesterday. Moreover, black market prices were elevated by one or two yuan, exceeding the limit price. No. 2 Siamese and Xiaowen also reached their ceiling prices. Thus, the results showed no violations on the surface, but in reality, all transactions were black market deals, with prices higher than the previous week by more than one yuan. Mixed-brand No. 1 Saigon was priced at 87 yuan, followed by 86 yuan; mixed-brand No. 2 was 81.5 yuan and 81.2 yuan; Huojiao was 86 yuan and 84 yuan; No. 2 Siamese was 80 yuan to 79.5 yuan; Xiaojiao was 79 yuan to 78.5 yuan; Milu was 76 yuan to 75.5 yuan; and broken rice ranged from 73.5 yuan to 71.2 yuan. Wuhu Jian was 77.5 yuan to 76 yuan. New transactions included Jianyuan and others selling over 1,000 tons of Xiaojiao for February delivery at 82-83 yuan, while Heyi and others sold over 1,000 tons of No. 2 Saigon for immediate shipment at 92-93 yuan. However, reverse futures were still being eagerly sought by hoarders, with prices for both spot and futures rising by one or two yuan. No. 2 Saigon for December was 93.5 yuan, late December was 92 yuan, and January/February was 89 yuan. Xiaojiao for December 9th was 92.5 yuan, December was 90.05 yuan, and February was 82.7 yuan to 83 yuan. It is estimated that over 1,000 tons were offered, and over 10,000 bags of spot rice were also offered.</p>
<p>The reason for this rice price surge is not a shortage of rice or insufficient inventory, but rather the fact that hoarders are relying on their substantial financial resources to buy heavily in both spot and futures markets. We have received a letter from a person signing as "Xin Wei," which reveals much about the current rice market situation. Our newspaper, in its position of journalistic reporting, cannot simply discard his words into the wastepaper basket. We are publishing excerpts for their importance, hoping that all parties concerned with the people's food supply will pay attention and correct any inaccuracies. What follows is a summary of Xin Wei's letter:</p>
<p>There should be a distinction between "rice weevils" and "rice tigers." Those who cheat on weight, underreport quantities, switch goods, deceive customers, and "eat the rice without eating people" are "rice weevils," and their crimes are less serious. Those who act as accomplices, control the grain supply, hoard and speculate, manipulate prices, and disregard human life with their financial power "eat people without eating rice" are "rice tigers."</p>
<p>Recently, rice prices have skyrocketed, with white rice jumping from 60 yuan per stone to 106-107 yuan, and foreign rice soaring from over 50 yuan to nearly 90 yuan. Rice is essential for the poor, who eat it every day. Even filling their stomachs with thin porridge is becoming impossible. Despite the authorities' price controls, unscrupulous merchants continue to break them. Even households with a monthly income of 100 yuan struggle to afford a stone of rice, and the common people are struggling on the verge of starvation. What have we done to deserve this catastrophe? There is a dark conspiracy at play.</p>
<p>(1) The organization of the Dachang Company, with a capital of 10 million yuan, specializes in collecting military grain and rice for profit, collecting over ten million stones of white rice, causing rice prices to soar in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and a shortage of goods arriving in Shanghai. (2) Holding onto spot rice, hoarding and speculating: there are 500,000 bags of rice in various warehouses in the two concessions, 300,000 bags in warehouses in Hongkou and Pudong, and 300,000 bags in various shops, enough to supply the city (at less than 8,000 bags per day) for five months. However, the rice tigers, relying on their financial power, refuse to release the grain, indiscriminately buying up spot, futures, and reverse futures, sealing them in warehouses, leading to the emergence of black market deals and prices exceeding the new limit. It is inevitable that the price of rice will be 160 yuan per stone by spring. How will the people survive? The five-day release policy to curb speculation was originally very generous, but the ink was barely dry before efforts to overturn it began. Recently, national stockpiling has become even more aggressive. If appropriate measures are not taken regarding warehouse stocks and the rice market, the food situation for the entire city will become unimaginable. The reason why these unscrupulous merchants dare to be so brazen is because they believe that if things go wrong in Henan, they can seek refuge in Binbei. Therefore, all plans are simply empty words. (3) Not content with hoarding and speculating, the rice tigers are also attempting to block foreign sources to break through price controls and facilitate manipulation. It is estimated that over 300,000 bags of Saigon-booked foreign rice are set to arrive in December, a significant amount. Therefore, rumors of Saigon's closure and blockades are being spread to repudiate rice orders and wipe out the source. If fixed orders lose credibility, no one will dare to fix them in the future. Although the city's inventory is substantial, it will gradually diminish, while the rice in the hands of hoarders can be sold for several hundred yuan per stone. However, there are still many who uphold integrity in the business world. Foreign firms such as Heyi and Fujia, and Chinese firms such as Changyi, Wanxing, Xinfeng, and Tongcheng, are delivering 100,000 bags of Saigon rice according to the set quantity, shipping them to Shanghai to relieve the people's food supply. However, due to the shortage of No. 1 Saigon, they have switched to No. 2 Saigon rice, reimbursing customers for a loss of US$1.80 per ton, or US$10 per ton if switching to broken rice. The remaining 200,000 bags sold by Shen × Foreign Firm and Chinese firm Jin × (Wang, who started by selling rice abroad, and brokers Cai and Li, etc.) have issued notices intending to cancel Saigon rice orders. Fixed order contracts are not trivial. If they believe that "contracts can be cancelled due to force majeure," then how can other Chinese and foreign merchants ship it? This shows an attempt to strangle the throats of four million citizens, break through price controls, and hope for a rice price of one yuan per catty. How vicious is their heart? Therefore, it is necessary for the concession authorities to enforce the law rigorously and demand that these unscrupulous merchants ship the rice to Shanghai by a deadline, without using excuses to delay, in order to alleviate the suffering of the people of Suzhou. I, as a citizen and a member of the rice industry, am saddened by what I have witnessed and cannot bear to see the citizens, who have narrowly escaped from the jaws of the tiger, unable to catch their breath. Therefore, I am revealing a part of it (Xin Wei).</p>
<p>Foreign rice is arriving steadily. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan ship, loaded with 1,703 bags from Hong Kong, arrived in Zhao'an the day before yesterday (15th). The Hanyang ship also arrived from Hong Kong yesterday morning, loaded with 2,233 bags. Both ships are unloading at the company's pier on the Bund in the French Concession (Zu).</p>
<p>Slightly more domestically-produced rice of thick and thin japonica varieties are arriving daily, but transportation remains difficult, so sellers are unwilling to loosen their grip. At the same time, sales are sluggish, coinciding with the agitation in the foreign rice market, so prices have continued to increase. Kunshan Jiaojian white japonica opened at 99 yuan, 97 yuan. Qingjiao Jiaojian thin rice opened at 89 yuan, 88 yuan.</p>
<p>Although new glutinous rice is already on the market, most has not yet been transported into the concession, so sellers continue to hold firm. At the same time, speculators, seeing that other goods have reached their limits while glutinous rice is not subject to these restrictions, have boosted sales, causing prices to rise accordingly. Guan Li white glutinous rice opened at 94 yuan, 93.4 yuan. Hong Kong white glutinous rice opened at 84 yuan, 82 yuan. Nuo Lu opened at 75 yuan, 73 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Foreign Flour Futures and Spot Prices Both Rise; American Flour Inland Cargo Even More Popular <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday was the beginning of the week, and trading in the flour market was quite active. In addition to regular sales, hoarders were eagerly buying up inland and foreign flour, causing the market to become increasingly bullish. This was due to the shrinking value of money, the rising price of rice, and reports of the free transport of imported goods, all of which fueled market enthusiasm. Unified City spot foreign flour of the Kaihua Bird brand Australian flour was traded at 5,000-plus bags, priced at 20.05 yuan, continuing to rise by half a yuan from last week. It is also said that hoarders are inquiring about inland cargo of American foreign flour. The Red Sun Brand's list price rose from 20.07 yuan to a new high of 21 yuan, but no whole batches have been sold. The market is extremely tight. As for flat-price flour, only 18 yuan is available, and the two factories only distributed over 5,000 bags, which is insufficient for the needs of the street, creating an opportunity for dumping foreign flour.</p>
<p>Wheat: The market was quietly firm yesterday. Due to the scarcity of both domestic and foreign supply and the rising price of flour, holders were reluctant to sell. The market's asking price had reached 32 yuan, but no formal transactions were made. The factory side, due to difficulties in procuring wheat, further increased its purchase price by five jiao, but only one or two hundred bags were collected at the door. The market is quietly firming up.</p>

Later in the market, a slight setback occurred when some financial institutions sold dollars, but US $5.8125 was difficult to settle, and British prices tightened.

<p>Yesterday's gold market was intensely bullish in the black market, with the rising trend suddenly expanding, and the price already above 5,900 yuan, approaching the 6,000 yuan mark. The consensus was upward, due to persistent rumors of positive news. The foreign exchange trend was tightening sharply, and after the swap, the bullish sentiment was strong. The shorts were mostly taking advantage of the swap discount, but seeing the unfavorable trend, they rushed to cover their positions, causing the market to be easily bullish and difficult to fall. From the opening, the price rose to 5,900 yuan, but a certain American bank's sale of US dollars briefly triggered retail selling, causing a pullback to 5,858 yuan. Shortly thereafter, the exchange market tightened, and exchange dealers and banks joined in, triggering a price surge. At midday, the price rose rapidly above 5,900 yuan.

Subsequently, due to a slight firming of the exchange rate after the opening, scattered individuals were willing to release at high prices, and the price slightly fell back. Securities firms sold 20 taels to banks at 5,858 yuan. However, the exchange rate softened shortly after, and buying interest revived, pushing the price above the 5,900 yuan mark. Gold shops bought 20 taels from banks at 5,905 yuan. Later, currency exchange businesses sold 20 taels to banks, bringing the price down by 10 yuan to 5,895 yuan.

<p>The government bond black market was still lackluster yesterday, with a fatigued and slightly stable market, but trading remained sluggish. Investor sentiment was idle, and most speculators were focused on the gold market, so the bond market was not subject to major changes for the time being, unless sellers flooded the market. Yesterday's transactions included over 200,000 bought by Hongtai, around 100,000 bought by Xie Kang. The sellers were mostly Shengtong and Hu Heji, but there were also scattered buyers offsetting, so the market turned slightly stronger. Changji Yizhong consistently sold in the morning and evening, while Lianhe Lianyi only absorbed slightly. As a result, all except the Type E bond were slightly better by 0.05 yuan, while the rest had a price increase between 0.1 and 0.2 yuan. The total number of transactions were roughly around 800,000 yuan. A simple chart is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock transactions: 200 shares of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory were transacted at a price of 29.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The public utility stock market opened firm and continued to improve due to strong public buying interest. Industrial stocks were the most heavily traded, with British American Tobacco, Jardine Matheson, Wheelock, Steel, and Jardine Spinning particularly outstanding. Rubber stocks also showed a good trend.</p>
<p>There were previous reports that a stock market would appear on the upper floors of a certain trust company. It is now reported that a Chinese Stock Promotion Association has been formally established. The association is an organization made up of colleagues from the trust banking industry, promoting legitimate investment, introducing fellow traders for the buying and selling of formally registered, superior Chinese stocks.</p>

<p>The yarn market continued to rise, with the bullish trend still strong. The foreign market softened, and speculative sentiment was good, so the market continued to advance. However, some, due to sales not being as strong as the previous day, tended to sell short. It was then heard that the "foreign side" not only showed no intention to sell, but also pulled in when prices fell. As a result, at the close, floating positions were unable to cope and had to cover at market prices, and the situation shifted from fatigue to high. Yesterday, 580 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The Double Horse opened on a harmonious tone as sentiment was enthusiastic in the afternoon of the prior day, buyers were eager to buy those coming in at 1324 yuan. Shortly, there was a rise to 1327 yuan, but the surface had rather a number of people looking to empty hats and the market had loosened for a bit, and the situation turned downwards, dropping prices within the 1320 range. The price fell to 1317 yuan, and hovered at the 1320 level for a long time. Nearing after 11, general small bankers would all send inquiries hoping to progress. The market saw an upward turn and the price continued to rise and the final price was at 1339 yuan. Half day of trading was said to be around 530 packs with prices of each Double Horse increased by 19 yuan. To the amount of buy-ins by the various syndicates in numbers, divided into the following,</p>
<p>Same line: five thousand 350 Hong Kong had 120</p>
<p>Ningbo 60</p>
<p>Total: Five thousand 530</p>
<p>The yarn market after had remained at such high levels. In the exchange office, the numbers for 20 Double Horse had first been transacted for 1343 with further prices and closures for bulls at slightly over 1338 to 1339 yuan.</p>

<p>The current state of market for cotton is stable, it does not mirror the upward trend and price of cotton thread. Because of pricing for cotton in foreign markets are not high. So, those in the marketplace are unable to trail. Nevertheless, the trend has continued to be stable.</p>
<p>The price of cotton has been low and market prices were static and quiet with the latest information from afar. There were merchants and factories who had been dumping the cotton and the closure price as result had fallen 2-3 pounds due to this trade on cotton and other trade. It is said that the local trade of cotton between Shanghai has had a very quiet presence. The factory has been buying less and less because traders believe that the city has been unable to move any more product.</p>

<p>The price surge of Eastern cloth is particularly fierce. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at around 37 yuan in the morning.

<p>Yesterday, the oil market was disrupted because some shorts in the December futures contract for raw oil failed to deliver the goods, leading to a complete standstill in trading. The market was filled with negotiation noises. In the end, a so-called mediator decided that the settlement price for Qingdao raw oil for December delivery would be 111 yuan to finalize the transaction. As a result, both speculative bulls and bears suffered losses. Hopefully, those who habitually engage in speculation may wake up a little. There were still a few spot transactions yesterday, and prices were stable without any significant fluctuations. Specifically, 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at 108 yuan, 50 pieces of Yantai raw oil were traded at 79 yuan, 120 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were traded at 80 yuan and 5 jiao to 81 yuan, and 50 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were traded at 112 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 16th, 1,700 cans and 300 pieces of raw oil arrived from Yantai. Exports included 695 bags of soybeans, 9,600 pieces of bean cakes, and 1,395 pieces of sesame, all transported to Hong Kong. On the 17th, another 6,000 dan of corn were transported to Yantai.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Coal Coal Briquettes Restore Composition - Still Made with Hong Gai Dust <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Yitai Hing old brand coal briquettes have always been made with Vietnamese Hong Gai dust, so they have high firepower and are durable. Due to the changing situation in Vietnam, no goods have arrived for a long time, and the Hong Gai dust stored in Shanghai has been used up. They had no choice but to seek other fuels to supply the citizens and temporarily manufactured briquettes with ordinary raw materials, so the ignition was inevitably slower. Recently, after the resumption of navigation from Vietnam, new goods arrived, and the factory immediately increased the proportion of Hong Gai dust used in manufacturing, so the products are of excellent quality, just like in the past. The special distributors in this port are selling them, delivered to customers for 172 yuan per ton or 8 yuan and 6 jiao per dan (100 market catties).</p>

<h3 id="e61">Political Superintendent of the French Municipal Council, Mr. Du, was Assassinated Last Night. He Died from Three Shots in Vital Areas. Rue Cardinal Mercier was Temporarily Closed to Traffic. The Two Gunmen Escaped Without a Trace. <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>A major assassination occurred suddenly on Rue Cardinal Mercier in the French Concession at approximately 7:15 PM last night. The target of the attack was Mr. Doumer, the Political Superintendent of the French Municipal Council and former Chief of the Advisory Office of the Special No. 2 Court. He was shot three times in the head, abdomen, and waist. Because the wounds were in vital areas, they could not be treated, and he soon died. The details of the incident are recorded below:</p>
<p>Former Judge, Newly Appointed Superintendent</p>
<p>Mr. Doumer, a Frenchman in his sixties, previously served as the Chief Judge of the French Mixed Court and was currently the Chief of the Advisory Office of the Special No. 2 Court and the newly appointed Political Superintendent of the Municipal Council. He had been in Shanghai for 14 years. He lived with his family in Room 34 of the apartment building at 24 Rue Cardinal Mercier and owned a private car, number 641, for transportation. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Doumer returned to his residence from his office at around 4:00 PM. After resting briefly, he was scheduled to attend a friend's dinner party at 7:15 PM. He instructed his family to notify his driver to wait outside, preparing for departure.</p>
<p>Three Shots in Vital Areas</p>
<p>As he stepped out of the apartment building entrance and was about to get into car number 641, two individuals ambushed him from the darkness. Upon seeing Mr. Doumer emerge, they fired five or six shots at him. The shots were like a string of pearls. Caught off guard, Mr. Doumer could not dodge and was hit three times in the head, waist, and abdomen, all in vital areas. He fell into a pool of blood, barely breathing. The assailants, seeing their mission accomplished, fled without a trace. Many residents of the apartment building, hearing the sudden gunshots, rushed outside to investigate. They found Mr. Doumer shot and lying on the ground, unable to get up. They managed to lift him into a car and ordered his driver to rush him to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Temporary Alert, Traffic Blocked</p>
<p>The Rue Cardinal Mercier Police Station was nearby. Upon receiving the news, they immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to drive to the scene. However, the gunmen had already disappeared. They collected several bullet casings at the scene of the incident and took them back to the police station for examination. After a while, the Lujiawan General Police Station was also informed. Police Commissioner Faber and dozens of officers personally led the police officers in multiple patrol cars, enforcing an alert at the major intersections of Avenue Joffre, Rue Cardinal Mercier, and Rue Cardinal Mercier, and blocking traffic. All vehicles and pedestrians in the area were prohibited from passing. As a result, the assailants could not be captured. It was reported that the alert was lifted and traffic restored at around 9:00 PM.</p>
<p>Old Age and Weakness, Incurable</p>
<p>After Mr. Doumer was admitted to Guangci Hospital, French doctor Martin performed surgery to remove the bullets one by one. However, due to his advanced age and excessive blood loss, he ultimately could not be saved. He died at around 8:35 PM last night. His body is currently in the hospital's morgue. It is reported that after the incident, the police authorities, due to the fact that Mr. Doumer was a high-ranking official who was tragically shot, have strictly ordered Chinese and Western detectives to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice within a deadline.</p>

<p>The New Year's Day of the 30th year of the Republic of China, which is the anniversary of the founding of the Great Republic of China, is fast approaching. All sectors of Shanghai believe that since the outbreak of the military conflict, which has lasted for more than three years, and after hard struggle, the final victory is approaching. All sectors will celebrate warmly at that time. All agencies, public organizations, schools, etc., will take a three-day holiday as usual. At the same time, all sectors will continue to promote the national construction savings and disaster relief movement, and will also expand support for the winter relief work planned by various charitable organizations to benefit the poor under high prices.</p>

<p>The British-owned China General Omnibus Company cited the continued decline in exchange rates, increased import material costs, and increased employee salaries as reasons, and informed the Municipal Council of its intention to continue increasing fares, averaging 35 percent. The company authorities posted the revised fare table with increased prices in the vehicles yesterday afternoon, and the increase will be implemented today. All sectors expressed surprise that public buses, which are the main means of transportation for the public, have repeatedly increased fares significantly, while there is no way to stop corruption on the vehicles. According to the increased fare table, starting today, the maximum fare for all bus lines has increased from 2 jiao and 8 fen to 4 jiao, and the minimum fare has increased from 5 fen to 8 fen. In addition, the monthly and quarterly bus passes will also increase in price starting January 1st next year.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Another Bloodshed Incident in Hongkou, Japanese Military Officer Shot, Lieutenant Nomura Hit by Two Bullets, Life in Critical Condition, Gunman Escaped, Child Hit by Stray Bullet <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>At 3:20 PM yesterday, another bloody incident occurred in Hongkou District, where a Japanese military officer was shot. At the time, Japanese Army Lieutenant Nomura Nakazaku was walking alone at the intersection of Taopeng Road and Huade Road in Hongkou. Unexpectedly, three or four men suddenly emerged from the roadside, one of whom immediately drew a gun and fired several shots at Nomura. Nomura was unable to dodge and was hit by two bullets in the chest and fell into a pool of blood. Upon seeing this, the assailants scattered and fled.</p>
<p>Japanese Resident Chases, Almost Shot</p>
<p>At that moment, a Japanese resident, Mr. A, was passing by and caught a glimpse of the bloodshed. He immediately followed the assailants, intending to apprehend them. However, when he chased them to Jilin Road, he was discovered by the fleeing men, who immediately turned around and fired their guns at the Japanese resident to stop him from advancing. Unable to do anything, the Japanese resident hid by the roadside, causing the assailants to escape without a trace. A Chinese child who happened to be playing by the roadside was injured in the leg by a stray bullet.</p>
<p>Serious Injuries, Life in Danger</p>
<p>After the Japanese side received the news, they immediately dispatched a large number of marines, military police, and police from the Japanese Consulate to conduct a thorough search on the roads and put padlocks on all the bridges over the Suzhou Creek, implementing a special curfew. Meanwhile, the injured Nomura was transported by car to the hospital for medical treatment. It was reported that after surgery, his injuries were still serious and his life was in danger. It was also learned that when the military conducted a major search of the area near the incident, they arrested a Chinese man on the street, named Yang Chun, on suspicion. He is currently being interrogated by the Japanese. All the bridges over the Suzhou Creek that had been sealed off were reopened by the Japanese side at around 5:00 PM yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Situation in Western Shanghai Shows No Improvement: Chinese Homes Demolished, Japanese Open Two New Roads, Rickshaws in the Settlement Face Restrictions <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in western Shanghai did not see any significant changes. However, the intersection of Jing'an Temple and Route Lafayette has been opened, and Route 2 buses can now reach the area directly. Apart from this, all kinds of vehicles can pass without obstruction, except for rickshaws that do not have a certain party's license. Regarding this issue, the Public Concession authorities have sent letters to the Japanese side and the "Municipal Government," urging them to pay attention. According to an official of the Public Works Department, rickshaws registered with the Public Works Department have the right to operate in the western Shanghai area, which is a fact that should be noted. The Public Works Department has not yet received a response. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Zhujiazhai Still Under Strict Search</p>
<p>Yesterday, the obstacles set up by the Japanese in front of the Bailai Bazaar on Yu Yuan Road were not removed, and the number of armed Japanese soldiers increased from two to three, with seven unarmed Chinese police officers. The Japanese opened a gap at the intersection of Jing'an Temple and Route Lafayette yesterday, allowing vehicles and pedestrians to enter and exit. In addition to the two armed Japanese soldiers, there were also several Chinese police officers. Route 2 buses can now enter. The barriers at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Avenue Haig and at the intersection of Avenue Haig and Yih Ding Pan Road at the southern end remain closed. Pedestrians must detour through Jing'an Temple Road or Yu Yuan Road to enter. The situation in Zhujiazhai on Yih Ding Pan Road yesterday was very tense. Behind the half-covered wooden fence, there was a layer of iron mesh, with two Japanese soldiers and five Chinese police officers strictly searching residents entering and leaving. Most of the lanes and alleys on Yih Ding Pan Road remain closed.</p>
<p>Public Buses Run in Sections</p>
<p>Yesterday, except for Route 2, which could directly enter the area from Jing'an Temple Road, the British-owned public buses still ran in two sections. Passengers had to get off at Jing'an Temple and transfer to Route 10 buses on Yu Yuan Road, with the intersection of Avenue Haig and Route Tenant as the terminus. According to another unconfirmed report, all public buses running on extra-settlement roads may return to the state before the 30th today.</p>
<p>Rickshaws Not Allowed to Pass</p>
<p>Although the Japanese side issued a notice on the 14th jointly by the "Public Utilities Bureau Shanghai West Branch" and the "Finance Bureau Shanghai West District Taxation Office" stipulating that all vehicles, including cars, rickshaws, bicycles, and carriages, must pay "vehicle donation" and obtain "vehicle licenses" at the "Taxation Office," all vehicles except rickshaws could still pass freely through the semi-blockaded area yesterday. However, rickshaws have been restricted. Rickshaws entering the semi-blockaded area from the Settlement area or entering the Settlement area from the semi-blockaded area are prohibited from passing without a "note" from the "Taxation Office." Yesterday afternoon, a reporter saw a rickshaw entering the Settlement area from the blockaded area at Jing'an Temple and was stopped by Japanese soldiers. According to the rickshaw puller, none of them had paid the "donation" for the "note" at the "Taxation Office" because the business of pulling from the Settlement area into the blockaded area was very slow. Someone pointed out that if each rickshaw owner pays a "donation" of 12 yuan per year, the other side can increase its "revenue" by 120,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Removal of Obstacles: Rumors of Heavy Fines</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," reliable sources heard this morning (the 16th) that the Japanese military police in western Shanghai have demanded a "fine" of one million yuan from Chinese clubs and other places in the area before removing the blockade. Most of the "fine," totaling 300,000 yuan, was paid by the Chinese Club, and the remaining amount was borne by several other gambling dens and public places in the western district.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Arbitrarily Opens Two New Roads</p>
<p>This morning, the Japanese authorities ordered workers to open new roads in the western district, one end starting from the place on Avenue Haig where the Japanese and Italian soldiers, Corporal Sasaki, were assassinated two weeks ago, and the other end connecting to Yu Yuan Road. A white wooden gate was erected at the intersection of this new road on Avenue Haig this morning, and it is believed that Japanese soldiers or Chinese police officers will be stationed there permanently. It is said that the new road is 40 feet wide and will be named after Sasaki after completion. The Japanese side also plans to open another new road starting from the extremely dangerous Jessfield Road, where the Japanese Corporal Saito was assassinated two months ago, and name it after Saito. This road starts from Jessfield Road, bypasses Brenan Road, and reaches Yu Yuan Road between Route Tenant and Yih Ding Pan Road, connecting with the aforementioned new road.</p>
<p>Many Chinese Houses Demolished</p>
<p>Near Jessfield Road, a large number of Chinese houses have been demolished to build "Saito Road," and most residents were forced to move out immediately after Saito's assassination. The Japanese authorities imposed a severe blockade for five days, causing more than 4,000 Chinese people to suffer. It is believed that the Japanese authorities will demolish more civilian houses to facilitate the construction of the new road between Avenue Haig and Yu Yuan Road.</p>

<p>The Chinese Children's Relief Association has collected more than 17,000 yuan in winter clothing donations for poor children in the city, as well as more than 1,000 pieces of new and old cotton clothing. It is said that the campaign is scheduled to end on the 19th of this month. The results of the solicitation before the deadline have not yet reached the expected goal. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will quickly contribute. New and old cotton clothes are welcome. The donation for each set of winter clothing is six yuan. The association received a letter from the Chinese Public School of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating that the students of the school have raised 1,000 yuan in donations, which is admirable. It is hoped that all schools will send the collected new and old winter clothes or donations to the association within this week.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Important Japanese Figure Hopes to Seek Understanding with the United States: Japanese Navy Has No War Sentiment, Pacific War Not Likely to Break Out Soon: Interview with Mr. Wei Gang, Correspondent of the American International News Service in Shanghai <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," Mr. Wei Gang, a correspondent of the American International News Service, recently arrived in Shanghai from Japan. According to him, unless an unexpected event occurs between the United States and Japan, there is no risk of war in the Pacific at present. During his time in Japan, he never saw any war-mongering spirit. He believes that even the Japanese naval personnel believe that if the United States and Japan go to war, Japan can show its strength within its own territorial waters. Important Japanese figures hope to seek a path to reconciliation and understanding with the United States and will proceed as far as possible in this direction.</p>
<p>British Army Greatly Boosted in North African War</p>
<p>Wei Gang also talked about the North African war, saying that the British army in North Africa has recently achieved significant victories, which cannot determine the outcome of the overall war situation, but if Britain can eliminate the enemy's obstacles in the eastern Mediterranean, it can send several main battleships to Singapore, so the North African war situation is very related to the Far East. Although Britain started the European war very late, the British people are inherently tenacious and are now truly at war. The British army took the initiative to launch an offensive in North Africa for the first time in 15 months and won.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Fu Tongxian Lectures on the Similarities Between Islam and Confucianism: Understanding Through Both Intuition and Reason, Seeking Permanent World Peace by Following the Will of Heaven <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The sixth lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Society was first introduced by Mr. Shen Lingjun, who introduced Mr. Fu Tongxian to lecture on the similarities between Islam and Confucianism. Mr. Fu is a professor of philosophy at St. John's University and has written a history of Chinese Islam. He took the stage to lecture. Islam is originally called Islam. This word has two meanings: peace and obedience. Therefore, the purpose of Islam is to follow the words of the saints and obey the will of Heaven to seek true and permanent peace in the world. Confucianism says, "The gentleman has three fears: fear of the will of Heaven, fear of great men, and fear of the words of the saints," which can be said to be in line with this. The basic belief of Islam is "There is no God but God, Muhammad is His messenger."</p>
<p>Intuition</p>
<p>We can know God from two aspects. The first is intuitive, which is personal verification. The God that is realized by intuition is "separate from language signs, separate from name signs, separate from mental conditions." The essence of God does not adhere to sound or place, nor does it adhere to beginning or end, existence or non-existence. Confucius said, "Sacrifice as if God were present, sacrifice to God as if God were present." The word "as if" is very sufficient to express this realm. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "How great is the virtue of ghosts and spirits! We look for them, but do not see them; we listen for them, but do not hear them; yet they embody things, and nothing is left out. They cause all people in the kingdom, to cleanse themselves, and array themselves in their richest dresses, in order to attend at their sacrifices. Then, like overflowing water, they seem to be over the heads, and on the right and left, of their worshippers."</p>
<p>Reason</p>
<p>The second method is rational, which is what humans can imagine. What we get from reason is only the great use and manifestation of God. From reason, we can know that God is all-knowing, all-powerful, all-perfect, and all-good. God maintains the principles of reason and controls heaven and man. The Book of Poetry says, "Heaven gives birth to the people, there are things and there are principles." It is similar to what Mencius said, "That which pervades everywhere is a vast, flowing passion. If nourished by rectitude, and sustained by no injury, it fills up all between heaven and earth." Islam has five concrete tasks to realize this understanding, which are recitation, prayer, fasting, almsgiving, and pilgrimage. Recitation is to concentrate on the Lord. The Great Learning says, "Knowing where to rest, one can be at peace; being at peace, one can be calm; being calm, one can be thoughtful; being thoughtful, one can attain." Mencius also said, "The office of the heart is to think. By thinking, it gets. Without thinking, it does not get." Prayer is to pray five times a day. Mencius asks us to preserve the night air and seek peace of mind. Islam only asks us to seek peace of mind at all times. Fasting is to abstain from food and sex, and also to avoid delusions and not to think wildly, and to be respectful in every move and humble in every word. Almsgiving is to give to those who cannot afford it with what one can. Pilgrimage is to gather what is scattered and return to its origin. These several tasks are all about obeying the Lord and loving people in order to achieve true and permanent peace in the world. This is also the work that Confucianists should do.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Rice Market Stirs, Price Limit Broken Again: Rice Industry Instructed to Report Brokers Through Their Association <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mutual Rice Industry Association and the Grain, Oil, and Cake Industry Association held an emergency joint supervisory committee meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday to discuss (1) how to suppress the increasing rice prices. It was resolved that since most of the transactions in the rice market are handled by brokers, the members of the Market Management Committee should conduct a thorough investigation. If there are any more incidents of secret price increases, and the Rice Brokers Association fails to report them truthfully, all members of the association should be prohibited from entering the market. If any members of the two associations participate in such transactions, in addition to requesting the authorities to impose severe taxes, they should also be prohibited from entering the market and their membership should be revoked. The above measures must be strictly enforced to maintain price stability and eliminate secret transactions to stabilize the rice market. (2) Whether to negotiate with foreign firms regarding the number one Saigon rice that has been registered by the industry. It was resolved that since the Economic Observation Mission of Vietnam had agreed to the shipment of the one hundred and fifty thousand piculs of number one Saigon rice when the Chairman of the Saigon Exporters Association visited Shanghai, letters should be sent to the foreign firms to expedite the shipment in January. At the same time, a letter should be sent to the French Consul General to request the local government to allow the release. (3) How should the two industry associations participate in the organization of public warehouses and nominate representatives? It was resolved that the principle of public warehouse storage is approved, and a public warehouse committee was established on the spot, nominating more than 20 members. The meeting adjourned at 5:15. It was also heard that a foreign firm received a telegram from the Saigon Exporters Association yesterday, stating that Saigon rice would be allowed to be transported to Shanghai in the future. At the same time, the Brokers Association also held an emergency meeting at 3 p.m. yesterday. As a result of the discussion, it was resolved that from now on, all members of the association must abide by the established regulations when brokering rice transactions in the rice market and must not exceed their authority. They have been divided into several groups, and each group has nominated a leader to monitor the members' actions in the market on a daily basis. If it is found that anyone is brokering transactions in violation of the regulations, they will be punished by public discussion. A reporter from New Voice visited a rice tycoon yesterday, who revealed that some rice brokers have ulterior motives and still have some rice purchased between April and May of this year that has not yet been sold, waiting for a good price to sell. If they were to sell it now, they could make a profit of about 30 yuan per bag (calculated by stone in the market), so the soaring rice prices are due to hoarding and speculation. The rice market opened at 9 a.m. as usual yesterday, and the market conditions were chaotic, and people were uneasy. The price limit was broken again, and those who sold according to the limit were filling the market with substandard goods.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Fufeng Flour Mill Went on Strike Yesterday: Authorities Trying Hard to Mediate, Labor Unhappy with Rice Subsidy Being Changed to Saigon Rice, Mill Hoping for Understanding Due to Difficulties, Workers at Foreign Newspapers Also Demanding Improved Treatment <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Fufeng Flour Mill, located at 126 Moganshan Road, is a large-scale mill with 800 to 900 workers. After the war, the cost of living in the city increased. The mill subsidized each worker with 3.7 dou of rice per month, equivalent to about 65 pounds, at a cost of only 2.85 yuan. In addition, a bag of the mill's Lao Che brand flour was sold at a cost of 1 yuan national currency. For a year, everything was fine.</p>
<p>Labor Demands</p>
<p>Recently, it has been difficult for the mill to purchase rice, so it ordered 500 bags of special number Saigon rice from Saigon to replace the rice, still selling it to the workers at the above low price. However, the labor side expressed dissatisfaction with this and sent several representatives to visit the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, carrying five demands: (1) Saigon rice should be subsidized at the market price of rice, with an additional 10 yuan of national currency per person per month. (2) A housing subsidy of 10 yuan. (3) Apprentices should not be dismissed without reason after two years of full apprenticeship. (4) Each person should be given an additional 50 yuan of pension at the end of the year. (5) Add another 1.3 dou of Saigon rice (equivalent to about 95 pounds) and still sell it to the labor side at the original price of 2.85 yuan.</p>
<p>Mediation Failed</p>
<p>After the Industrial Section accepted the request, it sent Mr. Gu Bingyuan to negotiate with the mill side. Because there was no result, all the workers went on strike together at about 8 a.m. yesterday. When the mill found out, it feared that an accident would occur, so it urgently telegraphed the Putuo Road Police Station to dispatch several armed detectives to protect the mill. However, all the workers were able to maintain order. Until 3:30 p.m., Mr. Gu Bingyuan, specially dispatched by the Industrial Section, rushed to the mill, summoned all the workers to the wasteland, and Mr. Gu persuaded them and described the negotiations with the capital side and the capital side's generous treatment of rice and flour subsidies. He also said that the mill's benefits to the workers included the establishment of a children's school, the construction of a hospital, and dormitories, all of which were better than other flour mills in Shanghai. At this difficult time, he asked the workers to understand the difficulties and calmly discuss them so that the strike could be easily resolved. After Mr. Gu's speech, the labor side expressed the difficulty of making a living and insisted on the above five conditions, which were difficult to resolve at the time. The reporter also visited the mill authorities, who said that the internal environment was difficult, the wheat raw materials were subject to control, and only one-third of the working dates were available this year. The profit was low, and the mill was barely able to maintain it. Now, the workers suddenly raised five conditions, which the mill was difficult to accept.</p>
<p>Foreign Newspaper Strike</p>
<p>Since the 14th of this month, all the workers of the Shanghai French Daily Newspaper have been on strike again due to repeated requests to the capital side to improve treatment. The French Daily Newspaper has not been published as scheduled in the past three days. It is reported that the striking workers have submitted the above request to the capital side, including increasing the salary of each person by 50%, subsidizing 9 dou of grain, and one load of coal briquettes, and requiring the capital side to distribute double salaries to the workers at the end of this year. The authorities of the newspaper believe that the workers had previously made a request for a salary increase several months ago and had gone on strike. After the authorities agreed to increase the salary, they resumed work. They have not accepted this repeated request. It is also reported that all the workers of the English-language China Press also submitted a request to the capital side yesterday to improve the treatment of the workers. The content of the conditions is roughly similar to the conditions currently raised by the workers of the North-China Daily News to the capital side. The newspaper authorities ... to maintain. They had requested the company authorities to increase salaries and alcohol costs several days ago. After receiving the request, the capital side summoned representatives of the labor side at the head office at about 4 p.m. yesterday. The two sides held negotiations. Regarding the conditions proposed by the labor side, the capital side also deeply understood the difficulties of life and would try to find a solution within the possible scope. Yesterday, all the telephonists continued to work as usual, waiting for a reply.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," since the beginning of this year, the Japanese government has issued a total of 5,067,000,000 yen in government bonds domestically, an increase of more than 800,000,000 yen compared to the 4,231,000,000 yuan in the same period last year. It is expected that another 1,000,000,000 yuan will be issued within the year, so the total number of government bonds issued by the Japanese government in 1940 may exceed 6,000,000,000 yuan. Tokyo newspapers reported that in view of the large amount of cash currently held by Japanese banks to meet the demand for funds at the end of the year, it is generally believed that the authorities should take special measures to increase the digestion of government bonds. The number of government bonds issued by the Japanese government this year is more than last year, and the amount of government bonds held by the Bank of Japan has also increased accordingly. On the contrary, bank deposits are gradually decreasing, reflecting that all sectors have increased their demand for funds in order to expand production. Moreover, it is even more difficult to expect ordinary banks to use funds to purchase government bonds at the end of the year. Therefore, the Tokyo government must give special consideration to the digestion of government bonds as the end of the year approaches.</p>

<p>The Silver and Money Industry Recreation Association suggested to the Banking Industry Association that a holiday be given on the day after the interest payment period on June 20 and December 20 of each year. They recently received a reply from the association, stating: "Dear Sir, we have received your letter on November 13, regarding the proposal jointly made by the colleagues of various banks in June this year to take a holiday on the day after each half-year interest settlement. As we are now compiling the bank holiday schedule for the 30th year, please include it together." However, the association once proposed the case, considering the hard work of the colleagues, and agreed to it. However, before consulting with all parties concerned, it was planned to postpone the implementation, and a letter had been replied. After that, we had in-depth discussions with all parties, and there were indeed some difficulties. The reason is that the interest settlement dates of various banks are quite different. The common ones are June 20 and December 30, which are nothing more than reducing the complicated procedures for calculating interest on June and the end of December. This is an internal advance work. Otherwise, there are regulations for regular holidays when sorting out accounts at the time of settlement. Moreover, foreign banks and money industry do not have this holiday, and the Chinese and foreign financial industries in the current environment should tend to be consistent. Therefore, the fact that the holiday on the day after the settlement date proposed by your association cannot be implemented. The corresponding letter is replied. I hope that your association will kindly inform all colleagues to understand this enterprise."</p>

<p>Chinese detectives Jia Keju, Xu Yongyuan, Yang Xinzheng, Cao Jinbiao, etc. of the Jiading Road Police Station arrested robbers Qu Duxin, Shen Sijing, Fang Shaoping, Zhu Wenkui, and prostitute Zhang Meilin from the brothel at No. 3, Lane 1, West Lehui Li at Room 205 of the Jue Lu Hotel on the 8th of this month. The five were escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation. After investigation by the detectives, it was found that Fang Shaoping, Zhu Wenkui, and Zhang Meilin had nothing to do with the theft. Only</p>
<p>Qu and Shen</p>
<p>stole a silk velvet coat worth 330 yuan, two gold rings, and several yuan in legal tender from Chen Peipei (20 years old, from Wuxi), a woman from the Xihu Guide Agency on Shantou Road, at Room 250 of the Huizhong Hotel on Hankou Road at 9:30 p.m. on November 14. Qu also raped Chen by using violence and intimidation. According to Qu Duxin's confession at the police station, he, Shen Sijing, and Xiao Wu, who is at large, went to the gambling house at the Six Nations Hotel on Haig Road in western Shanghai on November 13.</p>
<p>Heavy Gambling Losses</p>
<p>They then discussed stealing a coat to use as gambling money. Qu suddenly remembered that a friend, Zhou, had previously hired Chen Peipei, a tour guide woman from the Oriental Hotel, who was richly dressed. So, the next day, he, Shen, and Wu opened a room at No. 250 of the Huizhong Hotel, inviting Chen Peipei from the Xihu Agency to come. Because Chen had gone out, it would take two hours for her to come, so they called Ye Lai Xiang, a tour guide woman from the Xin Ming Agency in Fuxiang Li, Yunnan Road, to come and joke with them. Two hours later, Chen Peipei arrived. At that time, because Ye Lai Xiang's coat was not valuable,</p>
<p>Paid the Fee to Use the Trick</p>
<p>and Chen took off her black velvet coat and put it on the chair. Two hours later, Qu and others started to stuff the prepared cotton into her mouth and tie her hands and feet with ropes, putting her on the bed. They stole two gold rings, a coat, and 3.6 yuan in legal tender. Wu and Shen took them out first. At that time, Qu had a sudden lust and wanted to commit indecency. However, because Chen's feet were moving wildly, he took out a small knife and held it against her throat, saying that if she dared to resist, her life would be in danger. Chen had no choice but</p>
<p>To Be Raped</p>
<p>Qu sneaked out of the hotel and met Wu and Shen at the entrance of the Central Grand Theater as agreed. He first pawned the coat for 50 yuan and then went to the Six Nations Hotel. Unexpectedly, his gambling luck was bad and he lost quickly. Soon, he lost everything. Wu and Shen each got one of the gold rings, and Wu took the legal tender, etc. The detectives only recovered one gold ring and arrested Xu Rongchang, the owner of the Tongfeng Pawnshop at No. 45 Longmen Road, and Xu Liangchun, the owner of the</p>
<p>Everyday Pawnshop</p>
<p>at No. 129 Racecourse Road. They were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Li Zhishan, the police station's lawyer, stated the above situation and asked the judge to prohibit the public from listening to the case because it was related to morals. As a result, Fang Shaoping, Zhu Wenkui, and Zhang Meilin were released first. Qu and Shen were held to await sentencing. Xu and Xu were sent to the Prohibition Court to be fined.</p>

<p>Mai Rongxing, the manager of the Huitai Biscuit Factory at No. 484 Ningbo Road, recently received a series of threatening letters from the bandits, attempting to extort 5,000 yuan in foreign currency. Because Mai ignored them, someone threw a hand grenade at the factory entrance at 6:35 p.m. on the 7th of this month, along with a threatening letter. Tao Houfa, the person who threw the bomb, was arrested by Chinese Detective Yang Dechun and Chinese police officers. He was escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation. The trial continued yesterday morning. Ru Baoyi, the police station's lawyer, said that the defendant firmly denied it at the police station, so a detailed investigation was still needed. Therefore, he requested a change of date. Judge Feng then ordered him to be held to await another trial.</p>

<p>To the Editor: Regarding the report in today's Shanghai news of your newspaper about the kidnapping of Shi Fuyuan, manager of New Asiatic Petroleum Company on Yuanfang Road, there is a slight discrepancy with the facts. At 7:15 a.m. yesterday morning, when our store was opening, three people suddenly entered the store. One of them was wearing a mask, dressed as a Japanese, but did not speak. The other two claimed that someone was suing Mr. Shi at the Japanese Naval Headquarters and showed handcuffs, threatening him without allowing any explanation, and dragged him onto a waiting car (license plate number 7394) and sped away. We immediately reported the information to the relevant police station and the Hongkou Military Police to investigate. It wasn't until 2 p.m. that Mr. Shi suddenly returned, saying that he was taken to Guangzhong Road, Jiangwan Road, and into a small house, where someone was assigned to guard him. Soon after, the guard released him to return, and he was not released after interrogation at the Japanese Military Headquarters. We are writing this letter specifically to clarify and ask your esteemed newspaper to correct the record. Sincerely, New Asiatic Petroleum Company, December 16.</p>

<p>Xu Jingzhang, the owner of Sheng Soy Sauce Garden, lives at No. 66 Yuecun, Yidingpan Road, West Shanghai. He usually travels in car No. 3020. Unexpectedly, he was targeted by kidnappers who planned to kidnap him. They waited at Xu's house every day between September 11th and 15th of this year. Unexpectedly, during these few days, Xu's car happened to be damaged and was being repaired at the garage, and Xu also did not leave his house because of this. The bandits waited for several days and did not see Xu go out, thinking that Xu had been prepared after hearing the news, so they gave up the kidnapping plan. They continuously delivered threatening letters to Xu's soy sauce garden, instructing Xu to pay a huge sum of money, and also attached dangerous items such as hand grenades to intimidate him. After Xu reported to the police station, recently, detectives Yang Guanying and He Xiaozhi of the Old Zhabei Police Station arrested the five suspects in this case, Zou Heng, Wang Agao, Dai Liangchen, Yu Chunsheng, and Wang Wei (also known as Shengquan), at Tianjin Road, Haining Road, etc. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Ru Bao-i and Qian Xun-jiu requested permission for a postponement, claiming that the investigation was not yet complete. After reviewing the report, Judge Feng ordered the suspects to be remanded for a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Passing the Winter <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Zhixuan</p>
<p>It is said that snakes pass the winter underground by sleeping through the harsh cold, so some people call it "hibernation."</p>
<p>But what about people?</p>
<p>In mid-air, a large flag of a clothing company is waving, and the trendy clothes in the window attract envious gazes, reminding one of how fitting they would be, and how warm they would feel, like springtime.</p>
<p>Yet another window displays the words: "Winter is the time for tonics." Beautifully decorated boxes and bottles, large and small, are displayed in front. They seem to possess an astonishing power, that upon entering the mouth, makes one as strong as a polar bear, unafraid of the winter cold.</p>
<p>There are many other things. How many people, how many hearts, are paying attention to their faces, skin, hands, and feet, and more so, paying attention to how to enjoy winter.</p>
<p>But on a street corner, one finds a ragged woman, embracing her child, her head raised towards every passerby. Beside her, a new clay pot has been added. Looking at the rolled-up mat behind her, how will it withstand the rolling north wind?</p>
<p>The snake only needs to sleep underground to pass the winter. But what about her? She is a person!</p>

<h3 id="e92">I Love My Family <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Pufeng</p>
<p>I love my family.</p>
<p>In my family, the warm sunshine warms us all year round, and it is filled with lively air.</p>
<p>There are not many people: Dad, Mom, elder sister-in-law, wife, and me, five people, plus a maid, Wu Ma.</p>
<p>First, I should mention my seventy-year-old father, who has a body that has not yet declined, and is full of vigor. My father also has a strong heart. Having worked in education for nearly forty years, he has a lot of valuable historical information in his experience. He witnessed the budding of revolutionary seeds, the fall of the Qing Dynasty, and the booming situation of the May Fourth era. He uses the evolution of history to show us the prospects of the nation, and he has very firm confidence. Mother, a kind mother, is very capable in handling household affairs. My wife is too young, so my mother takes charge of most of the family's chores. My sister-in-law is a small teacher, and she works diligently and happily in educating children. My elder brother died nearly ten years ago, and she dedicated her enthusiasm and love to the sacred education. But in the family, she is a part of us, and she provides a lot of assistance. She also has musical talent, and she often turns her ten fingers on the piano keys in the evening, and our hearts are often immersed in the melody of lively nocturnes. My wife is a maiden who has not lost her childlike innocence and is still a bit naughty: but in the warm current of the family in the past year, my wife has become gentle and quiet. Handling housework aroused a lot of her interest. During the day, my wife works as a typist in a company for seven hours, and in her spare time, she puts most of her energy into household affairs; she is always planning how to make the home look more beautiful. We have only been married for a year, and we don't have children yet—although everyone hopes that a small bud will be born in this warm greenhouse and bring us a new feeling.</p>
<p>Every day after finishing work, I return home with a tired body. The warm wind of home immediately dissipates my fatigue. At night, in my father's bedroom, we talk about current events enthusiastically. My father corrects our mistakes from time to time, supplements our judgments, but also often accepts and agrees with the clear understanding of our younger generation.</p>
<p>At home, we also often work, and in hard work, we often get unparalleled pleasure and comfort. My wife and sister-in-law often help my mother make all kinds of snacks. Red bean babao rice is my mother's masterpiece. Sundays are usually lively in our family. Relatives, friends, and neighbors visit more often on this day than on weekdays. Sometimes, my sister-in-law entertains a group of children and holds a concert, so this small house is even more heated.</p>
<p>We have a budget for family expenses. Although the current prices are soaring, under the regular and diligent savings, we can still have a small amount of savings every month.</p>
<p>What connects us is: friendship, sympathy, sincerity, and trustworthiness. Our love exchanges.</p>
<p>Overflowing with light and heat, happiness and hope, I love my family.</p>

<p>(4) White Hair, Rosy Cheeks</p>
<p>Liu Rushi glanced back and saw that the young man walking in front was in his early twenties, handsome and extraordinary. It turned out to be Huang Yuqi, a student from Jiangyin whom she had seen at Chen Wuzi's banquet last night. Behind him, however, was an old man nearing sixty, with white hair at his temples. Huang Yuqi saw Liu Rushi and shouted loudly, "Rushi, Rushi, you are indeed a peerless beauty from Jiangnan. Today, I have come to visit you and introduce you to a peerless talent, Grand Secretary." As he spoke, he pointed to the old man and said, "Rushi, do you know who this old gentleman is? Haha, he is Qian Muzhai, Minister of the Board of Rites from Yushan. His reputation and talent, I think, are well-known to someone as refined as you. Truly, there is no one under heaven who does not know him." When Liu Rushi heard the name Qian Muzhai, it was like thunder in her ears. She had read Qian Muzhai's poems and lyrics and admired them very much, believing them to surpass those of her mentor, Zhang Tianru. Furthermore, she knew that Muzhai's name was Qian Qianyi, that he was the Minister of the Board of Revenue, and also a high-ranking official in the imperial court. His residence, the Red Bean Villa in Yushan, had two red bean trees and could be called the foremost talent of the present day. She had long admired him privately, only regretting that she had not met him. She never expected that he would condescend to come to her boudoir today. What an honor that was! Her jade face filled with a smile, she greeted him with a curtsy and said, "This humble woman did not know that Minister Qian and Young Master Huang would arrive. I am remiss in my welcome. Please do not blame me." As she spoke, she observed that Qian Muzhai, though old, was full of energy and had an imposing presence, indeed far removed from the common. Qian Muzhai also looked at Liu Rushi with a steady gaze, nodding frequently, his eyes smiling as he said, "I have long heard of your beautiful name and knew you to be an extraordinary woman in this world. Seeing you today, it is indeed not an empty reputation." Huang Yuqi laughed again and said, "Minister, you have always thought that there is no Yin Lihua in this world. Having seen Miss Liu, what do you think?" Qian Muzhai stroked the bamboo fan in his hand and said, "With Miss Liu here, all the beauties in the world lose their color." Huang Yuqi then said to Liu Rushi, "Last night, Chen Wuzi hosted a banquet, and Minister Qian Muzhai was originally on the list of invitees, but because he took a boat from Yushan to here, he encountered a headwind and could not arrive in time. He was eager to see your beautiful face, so Chen Wuzi taught me to lead the Minister here. You should welcome him." Liu Rushi smiled gracefully and said, "It is rare for the Minister to grace my humble abode with his presence." As they talked, Shi Da was drinking from a large bowl, oblivious to everyone around him. Huang Yuqi and Qian Muzhai couldn't help but find him a bit strange. Liu Rushi had already invited the two to sit in her boudoir. Mother Xu and the maids served fragrant tea and teacups, greeting them warmly. Qian Muzhai saw that Rushi's boudoir was elegant and not vulgar amidst its splendor. On the desk by the window were placed writing brushes, ink stones, paper, and ink sticks, and to the left and right were history books, with volumes and volumes lined up. Many paintings and calligraphy scrolls and couplets hung on the walls, all from the hands of famous people, mostly from the Fushe society. He could not help but nod again and say, "Beauty and talent are difficult to combine, refined and exquisite. Although there are many beautiful women by the Qinhuai River, how can they compare to Miss Liu here?" Liu Rushi naturally felt pleased in her heart when she heard Qian Muzhai's constant praise. She sat and chatted with them in a clear and gentle voice. Huang Yuqi asked her about the strong man they had just seen. Liu Rushi told him in detail about the events before and after their meeting.</p>

<p>— Hefe</p>
<p>Sex is a very common phenomenon in the biological world. For example, human beings have the distinction between men and women, and the distinction between men and women is extremely obvious in spirit, and even more obvious in form.</p>
<p>Eating and sex are the great desires of people, but they must have moderation, just like eating must have moderation. Everyone has sexual desire, and the impulse of sex is difficult to control. According to the research of biology and anthropology, we know that the starting period of our sexual desire is before puberty (the development period of human beings has three stages: (1) infancy. (2) childhood. (3) puberty. Puberty is at the age of fourteen to seventeen, when men begin to have sperm and women begin to have menstruation.) And the activation of sexual desire is after puberty; therefore, fathers and elder brothers should give them sex education during this period. This kind of sex education seems to be the responsibility of middle school educators. Sexual desire has considerable development after puberty and is divided into three periods: (1) It refers to the childhood before puberty, called: neutral period. During this period, psychological sexual desire has occurred and can be observed its contact phenomenon. (2) It is when the period of puberty is approaching, called: asexual indifference period. At this time, the direction of sexual desire is often shaking in various directions. (3) It is the development period. At this time, pursuit and love occur for the opposite sex.</p>
<p>On November 19, Ms. Lifang said in her article "Insulted and Damaged": "I am an 'insulted and damaged' person, but I know this is an educational problem, a unique and inevitable phenomenon under this social system…" Indeed, to make sexual desire restrained, the best method is to wait for the widespread implementation of sex education. Or exercise the spirit, strengthen the consciousness, and cultivate the ability of self-control. At the same time, browse noble works and reject improper books.</p>

<p>— White Dog</p>
<p>The impact of air raids on birds and animals is very interesting. Some dogs will run several miles when bombs explode. But most dogs don't have much change. Those cats that are brought into temporary bomb shelters often want to go back home. Caged birds that are usually pampered are the least disturbed by the sound of bombs. Canaries singing happily were found hopping on piles of rubble.</p>
<p>And the chicks are indifferent to the sound of explosions; turkeys clucking and crowing even more when planes fly overhead. Most ordinary livestock are mostly unaware of the air raids. In the zoo, lions and tigers roar louder, as if shouting out extraordinary tones. Bears just sleep their sleep. Penguins don't seem to know anything has changed.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Chinese Costumes, Chinese Props, "Thunderstorm" with Russian Dialogue <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Hao</p>
<p>Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm" not only won the praise of the vast Chinese audience (it is said that in Shanghai, no matter which theater group or which performance, it is always full), but also received considerable praise from the theater community abroad. Akita Ujaku even said that the Chinese drama movement is more advanced than Japan based on this play.</p>
<p>The director of the "Russian Theater" in Shanghai, Pripetkoia, decided to translate it and have his theater group perform it after watching the "China Traveling Theater's" "Thunderstorm." This was last year. The reporter met Pripetkoia and Jiang Jun, who was in charge of the translation, at the Xuan Palace Theater, but perhaps due to the complexity of the translation work, it was not until two months ago that they heard the news of the start of rehearsals. The local Russian community paid great attention to the performance of this play. Both Soviet and White Russian newspapers published lengthy introductions, introducing the author's life and the content of "Thunderstorm," which shows that the significance of this performance is not only for the novelty of "Chinese costumes, Chinese props, Russian performance." But unfortunately, this play, which has been prepared for years and rehearsed for two months, will only be performed today (8:45 p.m. at the French Municipal Council Auditorium, No. 11 Huanlong Road).</p>
<p>The actors of the "Russian Theater" all have more than ten years of acting experience. Pripetkoia himself will play Zhou Xiyi. Others such as Yanovskaya and Gorsky will play Lu Ma and Lu Gui, respectively. This is undoubtedly a valuable page in the 1940 "Isolated Island" art scene. The most sought-after performance, a famous performer playing the fire stick (namely Yang Paifeng), the whole city praises Yan Lang. (Only twenty-two years old, at the height of his youth and promise, with a bright future, it is hoped that he will work even harder.)</p>
<p>A cautious scholar, a rising star, (My friend said that he is polite and cautious, a scholar, and his art is outstanding, and he is also a rising star to be feared.) Can make ten thousand people amazed when he takes the stage, Whether it's an hairpin or a hat, it's all common, Four times coming south of the Yangtze River, he has gained a great reputation.</p>

<p>— Luyuan Scholar</p>
<p>Famous martial actress Yan Shishan, has come south four times, joining Huangjin three times. In the first two times, the dramas were placed in front, and were mostly not noticed, later arrivals often have a hard time seeing the true face of Lushan Mountain, and were submerged and obscure. Connoisseurs regret this. Since this spring, after changing affiliations to Update, her true art has begun to be presented to the public. Her play "Yang Paifeng" has been performed dozens of times, running for three months in a row, which shows her box office appeal and the enthusiastic welcome of the Shanghai people. It was discontinued at the end of June, and she carried her honor back north. After only five months, she came south again in late autumn and early winter with the Fuyuncheng Troupe, this is the fourth time; the Huangjin boss, appreciating the success of Update, looks at her with new eyes and values her very much, and often performs the finale with Ye Shengzhang, such as "Fighting the Melon Garden", "Green Peony", and "Three Forks", all of which were not performed in the previous times, because there is no one to support her, and it is also enough to show that she can play many roles. I watched "Green Peony", her style, demeanor, acting, and dialogue are all unique, all have unique features, which shows that she is not only good at martial arts. Other plays such as "Yang Paifeng", "Jinshan Temple", "Sizhou City", "Taking Yuling", and "Killing Four Gates", wonderful acrobatics, innovative patterns, extraordinary, agile and steady, vigorous and graceful, a gesture, a foot, there is literature in martial arts, and martial arts in literature, her unique footwork is just a side issue. Her art is more Mengjin than before, I was happy and sleepless after watching the play, so I wrote two quatrains to give to her.</p>

<p>— Fisherman</p>
<p>—The Truth of the Matter—</p>
<p>A few days ago, it was widely rumored that Bai Yun was going to join Min Hua. This news was quite sudden, because the merger of these two different styles was met with skepticism by many. But the truth is this:</p>
<p>After completing "Confucius," Min Hua decided to make "long-term plans." And the second work has been decided to be written by Fei Mu and directed by the German Frank. However, besides a very small number of basic personnel, Min Hua seemed to lack sufficient strength to cope with these long-term plans. So, they decided to recruit new talent, but because "photo stars" had become as numerous as carps crossing the river in the past, the conditions for applying were extremely harsh, even politely rejecting those who had already acted in movies. However, Bai Yun at this time still tried to actively join Min Hua. First, he tried to get acquainted with Frank, encouraging Frank to lobby the Min Hua authorities, and Bai Yun also went to Min Hua once, but Min Hua never felt "interested" in his activities. Until now, Min Hua has not shown any intention of accepting his full enthusiasm. This is the whole story of Bai Yun's outward expression of wanting to join Min Hua.</p>

<p>"Mulan," "Song of the Earth," "Business Sutra," "Gratitude and Revenge"</p>
<p>How to cope with the two hot seasons of Christmas and New Year's Day? Every theater is concentrating and using extraordinary means to capture a wide audience. The China Travel Film Company's "Mulan" couldn't catch up with Christmas. The Christmas season at the Xuan Palace was taken by the Unnamed Theater Troupe's "Mr. Wang"; "Mulan" can only rush to perform on New Year's Day. The Leyi Society will use the opera "Song of Shanghai" and "Song of the Earth" at the Lyceum to embellish these two festivals. The Shanghai Drama Society had already scheduled the repertoire before December: "Business Sutra," adapted by Xu Qu and directed by Wu Ren, starring Xiao Feng and Yan Jun, will be performed on Christmas. Two newly admitted newcomers—Jiang Tianliu and Qian Houru—will also participate in the performance, and Qian Houru is the daughter of playwright Wei Ruhui, and her acting skills have the same wonderful effect as Qian Yi. "Business Sutra" is a social drama, and its content gives great satire to those who sell their conscience. For the grand festival of New Year's Day, the Shanghai Drama Society has decided to perform "Gratitude and Revenge," which has been the most popular in the mainland and has never been performed in Shanghai. This is a masterpiece jointly compiled by actors Wu Chen, and the content is very realistic, with a strong sense of justice, which is exciting to watch. Indeed, during every festive season, there must be some excitement.</p>
