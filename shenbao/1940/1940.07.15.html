<h3 id="c15">封鎖滇緬公路問題 <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>關於日方向英國所提封鎖滇緬公路運輸的要求，經英方一度據理婉拒後，日方仍表不滿，竟以採取强硬手段相恫嚇：其駐英大使重光葵，在對英外决白特勒會談中，則更以英國之態度實加强東京激烈分子之措施作爲要挾。在日方這種兩面政策之下，據說最近英國駐日大使克萊琪已對有田成立妥協，允將滇緬公路作定期的封鎖，在這雙方尙未公布的時候，吾們有種種理由，不信英國竟然屈服。不幸而事實確如所傳，則誠爲英國在遠東另一嚴重失敗，誠不知英方將何以自解於遠東政策不變的一再聲明，更何解於關於條約和國聯決議所負的神聖義務；即關於英國在歐洲作戰的論據，亦不免自暴自棄。</p>
<p>滇緬公路本身的運輸能力並不很大，在雨季行車更屬困難，所以滇緬公路因爲中國西南的重要出海通路，其重要性也許還遠遜於日方無法干涉的其他路綫。何况中國的抗戰，主要靠着自力更生，經過三年來後方的經營締造，一切都向着自足自給前途邁進，對外的國際通路固自有其價値，但絕非如日方所表示：對於中國抗戰具有生死關鍵。日方在侵華軍事方面一籌莫展，竟轉而遷怒第三國，從去年此際就高呼「第三國之援助中國抗戰非日本所能容忍」，把侵華失敗責任諉之第三國家，而反英運動之類也就應運而生，形成日本獨覇東亞企圖的重要一環。其實，所謂第三國的援助，在中國抗戰中間究佔何等地位，自有事實予以說明；而尤以歐戰發生以來，列强都自顧不暇，更無許多餘力援及中國，而中國亦初未因此遭受何等影響。此度英方之允予封鎖滇緬路，傳係以二三個月爲期，在英方的解釋，容或認爲在雨季中對華損害並不太大。而中國之强烈反對封鎖，道義上的理由實更超過經濟上的需求。</p>
<p>日方之要求封鎖中國國際通路，在法理上原屬毫無根據；根本既未實行宣戰，當然不能享有交戰國的利權。現在日本自身需要倚恃國外汽油廢鐵的輸入，但却要斷絕第三國對中國的合法貿易；對於這種矛盾邏輯，英國原不乏充分理由予以拒絕。越南因爲法國戰敗投降，整個國家都幾乎難於自保，其對日屈服雖云不當，還勉强算情有可原。英國在西方向以反侵略不妥協相號召，如果在遠東竟一反其立塲，轉而支持侵略者的無理要求，把已往的言和國際義務一概置之度外，此則衡之當前國際複雜的利害關係，也未必是爲計之得。而其對於遠東有關各國所引起的强烈反應，於英國目前的處境也會發生重大的不良影響。</p>
<p>我們承認：英國現在正在艱危之秋，迫在眉睫的德義攻勢殆已使英方除却如何應付戰事而外，一切都不暇計及；但遠東的微妙局面却絕非饜足日方要求犧牲中國權利即可獲得苟安。上述重光的那種外交辭令，也許比日閥的虛聲恫嚇更有效力；其實日方之是否遵循極端分子意旨改變其對歐戰態度，一方決於整個國勢之演進，一方要看日本本身的實力現狀。英方曲徇日方要求之不能影響日本基本政策，正有如封鎖中國國際路綫之不足以動搖中國抗戰立塲。即以日方的南進政策而言，其處心積慮與積極佈置，又何嘗是最近英法荷印對日本的種種讓步所能轉移？</p>
<p>滇緬公路本身的重要性固不像日方所形容的那樣，但却是自由的中國對於歐美海上交通的一個最後孔道，同時又是象徵着中英友誼的一條動脈。該路的開闢曾使中英關係益臻密切，則該路如眞被封閉，殆亦不免對於雙方友誼投一個濃厚的黑影。至少亦使愛好中英兩國的人們，對於英國的一切需要另行估價。但是，我們確信克萊琪所進行之談判，無疑的與最大多數英人見解背道而馳；邱吉爾素以睿智見稱，在野時每發爲援助中國的宏論，現在應不致重蹈張伯倫的不幸覆轍。十年以來，大不列顚帝國在遠東權威的失墮與利益的蝕損，並不見得不比在西方嚴重；如果再不能以堅强立塲與侵略者相周旋，而僅以讓步妥協爲得計，則一面得步進步，一面退步失步，在不遠的將來，必不免在東方還要遭遇更大的威脅與困難。而另一方面，中國人力物力的雄偉，潛在富源的豐厚，國勢前程的遠大，在英國都應該有個正確的估量；同時，也應該打算今後對中國需要保持何種程度的關係？英國是中國的友國，但是並非獨一無二的友國；吾們切望英國對此四萬五千萬人民的大國族，鄭重的善加考慮！</p>

<p>美籍作家阿沙巴里斯氏在「文摘」最近一期發表一文、盛讚中國抗戰中工業合作運動之成功、並指爲遠東光榮前途徴兆、該文云、中國之更生、全在自己努力、其中最顯著之成就、爲工業合作運動之蒸蒸日上、</p>
<p>寇爾爵士從事推動</p>
<p>兩年前英人李維亞理及美籍記者愛加斯諾曾在華道倡此項運動、隨後英大使寇爾爵士力勸蔣委員長夫人發起工業合作運動、以救濟難民、終經國民政府核准、委任亞理主持此事、襄助此舉者、有華人留美工程師多人、</p>
<p>第一單位設於寶雞</p>
<p>一九三八年八月廿六日、工業合作社之第一單位、遂告成立、難民鐵工多名、在陝西　鷄設立一鐵工廠、次年十月卅一日機來襲、炸毀該廠、但英勇之華工再接再厲、經四閱月之努力後、在陝西西南部設立工業合作社七十餘所、</p>
<p>設立學校訓練幹部</p>
<p>由政府津貼之經費共四十四萬元、該額之半數、悉貸借於合作社社員一千八百人、以發展製造各種必須品之用、復設立一學校於　鷄、訓練幹部、半載後、合作社數日、增至一百八十二所、工人二四七五名、</p>
<p>出產價值達五百萬</p>
<p>據統計、一九三九年十月爲止、全國一四七〇合作社之出產總值、共五百萬元、投資額僅三·六三〇·〇〇〇元、結果難民均成生產之生力軍、據斯諾夫人調查一萬萬元之經費、足以建築一超等軍艦、如該額貸借於中國、則足以設立合作社四十八萬所、救濟難民八百萬名、</p>
<p>製造武器成本極低</p>
<p>美國海軍領袖果欲重視與日本作戰之不可避免、美國當局不若借款於中國、旣合實際、且對於人道上有莫大貢獻、上述之合作社、復能製造大量機關槍·手槍·步槍·及自動步槍、製造一手榴彈之費用、僅值五角二分、此種武器、源源供給於華方游擊隊、以打擊日人後方及交通綫、</p>
<p>日方絕對難以破壞</p>
<p>流動工業合作社單位亦在安徽·山西·日軍之後方活動、按目下情形、中國工業分佈內地、日機絕對無法破壞、故英勇之華工正在遠東建樹更光明之前途也、</p>

<p>最近的英國報紙上，常常談到第五縱隊，據說這個古怪的名字，是有俄國典故的。在俄國沙皇政府時代，有人問一個俄國將軍：俄國軍隊的組織是怎樣的？將軍告訴他共有四個縱隊——步兵·騎兵·砲兵·工兵，最後他加上一個縱隊，那便是秘密偵探。</p>
<p>不久以前在西班牙戰爭中，這個名字又復出現，而且卽刻成了「新聞」。據說當佛朗哥進軍向據守西班牙都城瑪德里的忠誠政府軍攻擊時，他宣稱開了四個縱隊，而其第五個縱隊，則在城內替他活動。這便是第五縱隊這個名詞包含了最近流行的字義，第一次和我們見面。</p>
<p>自從挪威都城奧斯陸被奸細賣掉之後，很多人寫信給報紙，要求肅淸英國內部的奸細。——就是在英國的第五縱隊。這些及時警告的通信，各報都將他們刊登在醒目的地方，因而在倫敦確然引起一時的哄動。有些人甚至主張全英國的外國人，都應該監視起來，卽使那些淸白無辜而同情英國的外僑，也應爲了公共治安而犧牲他們的自由行動。可是又有很多人不約而同的在通信上說，那些大有嫌疑，應該滾出英國到他們心愛的國家去的，倒不是外國僑民，也不是那些寫希特勒趕逐在外在逃難的德國人，而是那些英國世系而不忠於英國的法西斯分子。</p>
<p>平心而論，英國是一個民主國家；人民言論自由，本是英國的金科玉律。就算現在打了半年多的仗，却還是有人在宣傳反戰。有人以爲這些反對與德作戰的人，乃是阻撓政府的工作，應該以叛逆治罪，而在他們背後策動的第五縱隊，更應該加以懲罰。</p>
<p>際此全英國都在想法找出那眞正的第五縱隊時，却有一個很有名很成功的女作家曼林小姐，寫信給報紙，說她自己正是一個第五縱隊的份子。她的信上說：</p>
<p>「旣然我們還是民主主義的國家，旣然自由表現意志乃是民主主義的重要精神，那麼你能不能讓我這個所謂「第五縱隊」的份子，向你的通信各位，提出兩點反對的意見呢？</p>
<p>「像我們這般人，深信戰爭不能解決問題，以前旣沒有，以後也不能，如果大家就把我們看作內奸，將我們看作敵探奸細等等，那麼自由言論究將如何呢？難道爲了憤慨法西斯主義的緣故，便將民主主義的最大一件美德犧牲嗎？」</p>
<p>「旣然我們還是民主國，那麼反對黨也應該有表示意見的餘地。取消這一點，便是法西斯主義的開端。」</p>
<p>「第二點是，我們人數頗少（如果多了，早就沒有戰爭了）。我們值得這樣怒駡，值得這樣白費紙張嗎？」</p>
<p>她的信是很動人的！只要想，一位女作家居然公開地承認自己是第五縱隊的分子！我個人恰巧和這位曼林小姐相識，我敢担保她決不是一個奸細。她是一個和平主義者，民主精神非常强。可是她的信引起無數的反響。其中有兩個人的信，我以爲值得徴引出來。一個是我的朋友戲劇家諾布洛克先生。他最著名的作品，我們中國人知道的是老范朋克主演的兩張影片「三劍客」和「月宮寶盒」。他說，我們人人都可以有意見，都可以發表意見，可是有一些時期，一個人對於國的責任，比對自己的責任爲重；要知道有時候自己以爲非常重要的意見，一旦表示出來，也許對於抗戰勝利發生影響，換言之，也許阻礙最後和平。他說我們在頭腦淸醒之時，誰不討厭戰爭。可是現在誰不知道戰事已經臨頭，我們的責任是上前綫去。他覺得要想永遠停止戰爭，只有在太平盛世，爲這目的而奮鬥，戰事旣經爆發，從中再說掙扎和平，這是不智，是自己分散實力，是爲國不忠！</p>
<p>第二封一針見血的信，是加底甫人斯東先生寫的，他說</p>
<p>「曼林小姐在她頗爲坦白的信上，說她和她的同志們衹是少數派，（她說如果多了，早就沒有戰爭了！）她是對的。因爲要是我們（連曼林小姐在內）也淪到那比戰爭還苦的波蘭·奧國·捷克·丹麥人一樣地位之後，也許沒有戰爭了。」</p>
<p>大家都知道中國有句古語：「兄弟閱於牆，外禦其侮，」這句話正應該用到今天的時局上去。</p>

<h3 id="c84">半年來上海金融之動態 <a href="#c84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— 俞燮麟</p>
<p>在此半年期間，上海金融市塲變動　常。游資更爲充塞，投機更爲旺盛。迨至五月中旬，大局突變，紐約股市亦吿激落，於是上海金融亦起變化，外匯回漲，股票及紗均見猛跌，投機者卽遭嚴重之損失。茲將此半年來之金融動態，分析於下，以供讀者參考。</p>
<p>外滙</p>
<p>歲以來，暗市匯價，趨鬆挺之勢。計自一月四日開市後，一度衝出五便士與八美元，但其間起伏不定，仍不脫投機局面。因有和平謠傳，及英國限制金融法令之頒佈，並有日本倒閣之消息，故人心不定，均抱觀望態度。旋因歐局惡化，港地資金向滬逃避，頭寸增多，匯價趨鬆。一月底，和平空氣湮滅，更兼日紗廠給款甚殷，匯市略見緊縮，但以港電時有拋出，匯價漸趨穩定。二月初旬，適爲二十八年度總結束之期，金融情勢，呈緊張狀態。華行與出口商及投機者頗有吐售，但外行吃胃甚健，日行與沙遜及津帮扒吸甚力，更兼棉花進口商從事活動，故匯價績見緊縮。期後紅盤甫開，投機操縱之風，已入瘋狂狀態；現金猛漲於先，外匯緊縮於後。同時米麥棉之進口商，大量收購，雖有多頭供售，但匯市軟勢終難挽回。至月底英匯已縮至四便士一二五；準基金出而維持，匯價乃趨穩定；基金方面供售之數，估計在五十萬鎊至七十五萬鎊之間。旋因中美新借款成立，匯市乃吿平穩。三月初旬，英鎊在紐約市塲繼續跌落，由四日之三九九二二五跌至二十一日之三元七二。三月二十五日英國乃加强外匯統制，規定特種商品運往特定國家者，必須以指定外幣或英國政府公定行市所取得之英鎊償付代價。鎊價乃更見低落，至三月二十九日爲三元五二又八分之五。上海美匯隨之，亦由六元七一八七五，縮至六元〇三一二五。英匯並無波折。一般多頭均轉向美匯及期貨活動，致現期行市吿緊，遠期差額擴大。資力雄厚之銀行頗有經營套匯者國銀行以緊縮之遠期美匯供給進口商與投機家，而按四便一二五購進卽期英匯，再至紐約市塲拋出英匯，套進美匯，如此套匯，頗可獲利。英鎊在自由市塲之買賣，已甚狹隘，更兼東亞方面之套匯，使英美比價之均衡，時爲破壞。故三月間之上海匯市，幾全受英美匯兌之支配。基金方面，為穩定市而起見，將英匯釘住於四便士一二五，對美匯任其自然，此適為投機者謀維持，同時英美匯價亦較穩定，故美匯亦無巨變，更兼四底比期，銀根趨緊，匯價亦趨穩定。</p>
<p>四底過後，暗匯卽起突變，匯豐掛牌亦猛縮，五月二日，英匯改掛三便士二五，美匯掛四元六八七五，英匯達去年八月十一日最低價，美匯更打破去年九月十九日五元半之紀錄。市况混亂，買氣四起，三日午後，匯豐更掛空前之低價，英匯爲三便士，美匯四元三一二五，市價亦卽猛縮，四日之英匯僅三便士餘，美匯爲四元半。平準基金維持暗匯於四便士一二五已二月餘，爲何突然放棄，實因匯市遭遇之困難也。歐戰後，各國運華貨物並出口貨物則並無進展，故本年第一季中，全國入超達一七百萬鎊，國際收支不免大受影響。此其一上海游資雲集，競以投機操縱爲目的，就各金融業之營業報吿加以分析，活期存款竟佔全部存款百分之七十之多，此般活期有款，均在待機而動，乘機而用，故活存增而投機盛，投機旺盛對於匯市增重壓力。此其二。貶低匯價，蓋所以調整對外貿易，且可以對投機者給以打擊。</p>
<p>自歐戰擴大，德軍優人荷比，在滬之荷比銀行受其影響，爲應付提存起見，不得不處分其所有外滙。同時南洋華僑爲預防可能之危險及嚴格之滙兌管理起見，乃大量滙款歸國，上海滙市亦因而堅挺。因之五月十一日英美比價雖起變動，跌至三元左右，但上海滙市，英美滙均繼續放長，實出乎一般投機商意料之外。五月中旬以後，謠傳紛紛，大半偏於歐局方面，致扒戶銷聲匿跡，多頭繼績拋塞；而外行吸胃，亦相形見絀；於是滙市順利，逐　趨鬆；於五月十四日美滙出五元，十七日英滙出四使士。六月十一日因紐約鎊價激增至三元八角，並有義大利參戰消息，滙市更趨　勢，英滙穩定，美匯高漲，是日卽出六元。</p>
<p>自暗滙屢次變動，投機操縱，伎倆更精中外銀行，有鑒於此，乃採行合作辦法，自月三十日起，一致拒絕外滙掉期，使投機者受打繫。因投機份子，泰半經營外滙期貨；普通期貨，爲一月二月三月期；如屆期交割，可向銀行要求貼現轉期，延至下月再交割；以期屆時滙率能獲餘利。今各銀行停止掉期，能使投機者陷於窘態；對於壓制投機，當亦能有所補益也。</p>
<p>標金債市之漲落，隨匯價而定，茲從略。此半年間，債市穩定，無重大變動。歲初開盤，卽見向榮，因日本閣潮劇烈，兼有和平空氣之散佈，投機者大事活動，投資者亦起而參加，行市始終站在高峯。至一月三十日，統甲達六三·六五元，統乙五四·三〇元，統丙五一·七〇元，統西五〇·六五元，統戊五一·三五元，此價實為戰後所罕見者也。二月十二日紅般開做，適逢外滙猛縮，標金暴漲之際，益以公債不做押款，因而現貨源源拋出，債市卽見不振。四月間之債市，因環境有利，多方加碼。一般投機家亦捨現金與紗花，而從事活動於債市，以致求過於供，價格上升，統甲二度衝出六十元。及至四底，銀根過緊，更因洋股在漲，外滙套息達五分以上，投機家乃捨此就彼，價乃下落。五月中旬以後，外滙回鬆，現金跌落，更因外股慘落，債市因而回漲，十四日突漲一元左右。人心看好，公債補空及新多均有興起，統甲乃出六十元，丙戊兩種亦出五十元。旋因吃息過高，使人裏足，債市乃成盤旋狀態。六月四日，因有良好消息，人心為之振發，多方加碼，空頭扒補，價乃大升，至五日統甲已達六十一元四角。及至六月底，外滙趨鬆，消息尙有利於多，故市價仍趨於堅。</p>
<p>外股</p>
<p>外股市塲，我國人士素少問津，但自歐戰以後，上海游資更見充塞，據金融界估計，去年年底游資達三十萬萬元，上海一隅，如何能容如許游資，乃羣趨投機。去年投機尙限於外滙標金，本年游資增加，投機範圍亦因而擴大。外股亦被選爲投機目標之一。自年初開盤後，市價飛騰，至五月初句，各項股票之市價均高至票面五倍以上。如二日市價，怡和漲至七十八元，會得豐竟達二百元以上，英聯亦騰至七十元。但未及一週，會得豐之市價已跌剩一百十二元。其他亦一致慘跌。更因紐約股市慘跌，外股市價更吿不支，賣風四起，買方不敢抬頭，因致一般散戶及盲從投機家，皆損失重大，破家蕩產者，時有所聞。五月下旬，會得豐價已只剩四十一元。二週之間，價格竟差達數倍之巨。實屬罕見。股市經此巨變以後，欲望恢復，恐已絕望。投機者可以醒矣！</p>
<p>銀錢業</p>
<p>自二十八年九月八日國防最高委員會核定「戰時健全中央金融機構辦法綱要一十條，四行聯合辦事總處遂據此改組成立，關於四行聯合貼放事宜，設立貼放處主管之。上海貼放會亦依四行總處所訂辦法於一月份加以改組爲四行聯合辦事處上海分處，採委員制，由委員中公推一人爲主任，下設業務文書會計三組，所有過去貼放委員會所押放之款，均由上海分處接管。一月份止該處放款餘額計一千七百七十五萬元，二月份計一千七百三十萬元，三月份爲一千六百八十餘萬元，四月份計一千七百二十萬元。</p>
<p>本年度上海增設之銀行，爲廣東銀行及國華銀行開設分支行於霞飛路。</p>
<p>六月十八日南京商業儲蓄銀行上海分行宣吿停業。按該行總行成立於民國二十四年三月，資本一百萬元，總行設於南京，戰後遷至重慶，上海分行成立於去年六月，因週轉不靈而停業。</p>
<p>新匯劃</p>
<p>茲錄第九次檢查報吿，至本年三月底止，各行莊繳存同業匯劃担保品評價總額國幣五千五百五十四萬另六百二十元八角三分，內（一）貨物二百萬元，（二）有價證券一千一百萬元，（三）房地產四千二百萬元。同時凖備會已審定之領用匯劃總額國幣二千四百五十六萬元，內（一）各行莊已領用數二千二百萬元，（二）各行莊尙未領用數一千二百五十萬元。觀其担保品之內容，以房地產爲主，以各行莊已投資停滯之財產，變爲流通性之匯劃；當今上海游資充塞，通貨膨脹之際，似非相宜。</p>
<p>金利</p>
<p>中中交農四聯總處上海分處所開</p>
<p>中中交農四聯總處上海分處所開之貼現率為百分之七·五，放款息為二角五分之折息與貼現息國幣爲二角八分，至今未變。匯劃以一月下旬之一角八爲最低；五月一日升至三角三高峯後乃趨穩定。同業匯劃以一二月間之一角五為最低；五月一日升至三角後穩定。錢業拆息以一月二十七日之一角為最低；五月一日之二角五爲最高，以此遏制投機，牧效自機。終不及積極之停止接濟投機家爲善耳。</p>
<p>票據交換</p>
<p>本年市面景氣，投機繁盛，票據交換額激增，一月份計八萬萬三千五百餘萬元，二月份爲八萬萬八千六百萬元，三月份爲十萬萬零三千七百餘寓元，四月份爲十二萬萬九千七百餘萬元。五月份爲十萬萬零三千四百萬元，六月上上月爲三萬萬六千七百萬元。其內容以國幣部份佔大多數，匯劃部份佔一小部份，可知目前游資膨脹。而匯劃流通之减弱，似係資金封鎖政策之失效。</p>
<p>上海銀錢兩業，為便利票據收解起見，於二十八年七月四日起，錢業準備庫及匯劃莊四十餘家，以委託代理交換方式，加入銀行之票據交換所，實行以來，頗稱便利，由是票據交換乃得集中，實爲銀錢業票據淸算之一大改進也。但於本年五月十三日起錢業退出交換，恢復舊法，所有各行收入之錢業票據，仍由銀行聯合準備會代收，再由該會與錢業準備庫彙總軋賬。誠莫名其妙！</p>
<p>本年有南京銀行及惇叙銀行加入票據交換所，准其以代理交換之方式參加，按該所原有代理交換銀行十家，現再參加二家，共有十二家。</p>

<p>當匯割實施之初，匯劃貼現僅一二元而已。其後資金逃避及外匯投機與套利旺盛時，乃羣將匯畫以換現鈔，因匯劃不能購買外匯，於是匯劃貼現繼續上升，於去年七八月間，每千心竟貼二百五十元以上。自歐戰以後，逃資歸回，銀根趨鬆，匯劃貼現亦因而降落。一月二十二日不過二十四元，及紅盤甫開，投機在盛，卽隨之上升；二月二十八日達十五元。四月二十二日已達一百十五元；四底過後，外匯暴落，市塲恐慌，又似去年七八月之景况矣；五月四日竟達二百三十元，可謂本年上半年度之最高價。五月份始終盤旋在一百元以上，自六月十一日起始進百元關；以後卽在七八十元上下。匯劃貼現之存在，資金封鎖之策完全失效。故銀錢當局，當設法抑阻爲宜也。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>半年來上海金融動態，已如上述。上海金融所以成如此局面，因各地資金聚集上海，在去年底估計游資為三十萬萬元，至端陽已達五十萬萬元矣。國際局勢繼續緊張之今日，向上海流來之資金必更多。游資充塞，更兼資金又無適當之管理，故投機國貨，爲所欲爲，價格一時暴漲，一時激落，致市塲爲共擾亂。投機家損失尙爲小事，國家經濟受損害，乃大矣哉。自後當將資金給以適當之管理，使投於有用之途，金融病態亦能因以改善。</p>

<p>如據美對英計算，則上海美滙應為五·八五八三三元，此與匯豐掛牌美匯僅差·一〇八三三，掛牌係以銀行賣價為標準通常應較平價縮1/16至1/8，為賣出銀行之手續費與盈利。惟滙豐掛牌僅為市價標準，實際行市與掛牌仍有出入。卽滙豐自身對外買賣，亦不照掛牌計算也。</p>
<p>（三）平時英對美與美對英亦略有出入，但爲數甚微，至多不過幾厘幾毫。但自英國統制外滙以後，在倫敦不能自由以英鎊購美滙，英對美四元〇三分半係官定滙價不能代表實際行市。在紐約則英鎊與美元可以自由交換，故有自由英鎊之稱。自由英鎊雖跌至三元一角，而倫敦官價仍能維持四元〇二分半者卽因在倫敦不能以英鎊自由交換美滙故也。</p>

<p>方正君問題六則，茲簡答如次：</p>
<p>（一）所謂外滙，係對外滙兌或國際滙兌之簡稱，即以國幣換算外幣。報載之滙價，即其換算上之價格。法幣換算外幣，原則上應依中央銀行掛牌之法定價計算。滙豐掛牌者，亦屬黑市塲滙價之一。</p>
<p>（二）所謂黑滙市塲云云，係英文Black　Market之譯名，指非法市塲而言，參看前列李光周君第一問之簡答。</p>
<p>（三）中　滙兌平準基金委員會成立於二十八年三月中旬，中英各　五百萬鎊，英方參加者爲滙豐銀行及麥加利銀行，華方則爲中中交三行。</p>
<p>（四）中英匯兌，指法幣與芙鎊之滙　行爲而言，法弊合英金之滙兌法定價爲一先令二便士半，故每鎊合法幣之法定價應爲十五元四八三八七。此種滙價之恢復，並無困難，惟目前尙不合戰時貿易政策之方針耳。</p>
<p>（五）研究國內金融問題者，在滬有余融導報，銀錢界，銀行週報，中央銀行月報等；研究國外余融問題者，尙無專門刊物，惟中外經濟拔萃月刊頗多此類譯交，專門辭書尙不多見，記者與潘文安先生台編之財政金融大辭典（世界書局出版），可以參考。</p>
<p>（六）讀該書不如讀楊蔭溥先生所編之經濟常常識爲優。</p>
<p>朱勤君問題二則，茲簡答如次：</p>
<p>（一）滬付國幣百元港收幣數。至於港付滬收者，在港另有市價。</p>
<p>（二）香港之申滙現貨行市，係港付港弊百元滬收法幣數。尊示五月八日市價四四〇及四四五者，即港付港幣百元，滬收法幣四百四十至四百四十五元。</p>

<p>據上海經濟諮詢所報吿云、上週匯市、若依前週週末走勢、本應看鬆、而週一開盤平穩異常、殊出意外，當鬆不鬆、或足反映、鬆勢已弛、故週二三紆徐而下、週四緊勢忽形加劇、一日間美匯現貨竟縮二一八七五、週五六又呈盤旋之局、考本週市塲所傳起伏因素、有下列各點、</p>
<p>一·英國有被要求停止協助法幣之傳說、</p>
<p>二·「新幣」卽將出現、</p>
<p>三·宋氏內定爲經濟作戰部長、</p>
<p>四·游資充斥、</p>
<p>（一）英國有被要求停止協助法幣之傳說，一時人心不免恐慌、殊不知中國之所以維持上海外匯者、本為維護各友邦之商業、用心良苦、犧牲亦鉅、英國當不致甘自遺棄、萬一中國實迫處此、自當另謀對策、且滬上黑市本爲鉅額漏巵、節此一流、法幣之基礎、當更見穩固、</p>
<p>（二）新幣出現、亦足與人刺激、然其準備能吾充實、人民對之是否信仰、殊不敢必、而對方商人仍以維持法幣爲有利、似不願自貽伊戚、况當「新政權」成立之初、匯市影響、不過爾爾、卽令推行「新幣」、僅其手段之一種、其對於法幣之作用、亦可想見、</p>
<p>（三）宋子文氏有出　經濟作戰部長之說、夫經濟作戰部之設立、顧名思義、其重要可知、且宋氏　力主建全財政政策、以彼個性出負經濟作戰仔肩、凡有利於作戰經濟者、勢必次第推行、而對滬上黑市、弎將施以適當措置、</p>
<p>（四）滬上自最近股票·棉紗·等慘落以來、囤戶脫貨求財、以致銀行存款日有增加、兼之南洋華僑因當地之不安、陸續逃資來滬、據報載最近竟達十五萬萬元之巨、而內地採辦滬貨、匯款來滬者、爲數亦鉅、百川匯源滬上之游資、益形充斥、坐耗利息當非善策、久伏思動、各市塲遂有活躍之趨勢、惟匯市與各市塲息息相關、互為因果、本所已於前週言之、然目前法幣基礎、異常鞏固、觀乎平準會供給之數字、卽可窺見一斑、平準會成立於去歲三月、基金一千萬鎊、輾轉運用至四底估計、尙餘約一百五十萬鎊、五月以後、陸續吃進約二百餘萬鎊、迄今約可餘四百萬鎊之譜、時閱十六月、共耗六百萬鎊、以四元美金計算、月耗僅美金一百五十萬元、中國向有巨額入超、戰時自淥允甚、今所耗區區、足證我國資力充沛、處理得宜、雖値此狂風駭浪、猶能應裕如也、</p>

<p>—七月十三日止—</p>
<p>外匯與外股</p>
<p>一週來上海金融情况、忽然轉向緊張的趨勢、外滙軟縮、美金自六日的六，三一二五降至十三日的六·〇〇、英金則自四·〇三一二五降至三·八九〇六二五、前者的波動是〇，五三一二五、後者的波動是〇·一七一八七五、外股挺俏、普通股本週五較之前週五底平均數是昇起一六·一〇、而橡皮股更是驚人的漲風——昇一〇三·三八、至於其他與外滙有關的市塲亦莫大轉向利多的一面、</p>
<p>外滙所以轉緊的原因、美總統宣稱各州門羅主義、日本向英一再要封鎖由中國的緬甸通道、都是有相當的關係、久蟄思動的投機家、於是趁機扒吸、進口商跟蹤購結、商人的動作向來跟隨投機家後面走的、看見滙市在轉緊、深恐再縮、不如趁行市還在有利的情况下、預爲佈置、因之週初商人的動作沉寂、以後進口商便有五金·機器·洋米·麥·棉花·烟草·煤油等的大量結款、試就收盤價來證明上平週下降的程度美滙不過十六份一分、（這是投機家的壓力）、下半週下降的程度擴大到三十二份之七（這是商人的壓力）、便可了然、</p>
<p>外股本週成交股票、二、一九六、五五五股、債券一、三八八張、成交價値共計一千四百三十萬元、外股的挺秀主要的是橡皮股、實業股是被帶起的橡皮股上漲的原因、根本的因素當然是外一滙所影響、不過克羅華、英楂華、所宣佈的優厚中期股息、適當其時、亦是重要的原因、</p>

<p>泅水（二）</p>

<h3 id="c97">穿短衣的反響 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 陳乃超</p>
<p>前幾天某君在本報刊中提倡穿短衣，果然的，短衣在夏季非常方便，涼爽，於是我便如法實行，提倡提倡穿短衣，使社會人士以後免得穿長衫的麻煩。前天我到某大廈去訪友，因為他住在該大廈的四樓，於是我便一步踏進電梯，而電梯是空着的。入電梯後，司機對我瞟了一眼，電梯依然不動，等了一會，我也不叫他開看他怎樣？最後走進了一位衣冠堂皇者，電梯方才上升</p>
<p>由此看來，上海人是看不起穿短衣的，以為是下等人吧。平是我總是穿長衫和西裝，有時我到那大廈的電梯，不論有没有乘客，總是扶摇直上。可是那天穿了短衣，那司機者便將眼睛放在額上，況且那天所穿的是一套白紡綢短衫庫，不可算下等吧！可是却得到這樣的遭遇。為什麼上海人看不起穿短衣的呢；没有禮貌嗎？不是，大概他們目光中以為穿短衣的就是下等人吧；</p>
<h3 id="c98">吃檇李的藝術 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 平心</p>
<p>中國人是最講究吃的。也特别合於藝術。光就吃飲酒說，決不像西洋人的一舉而盡，却是把著杯子，一口一口的喝。有時還要先向同飲的人，說一聲「請」。</p>
<p>現在走過大馬路一般水果店門前，總可看到裏面一盤一盤的擺着通紅的李子，這就叫做檇李，是嘉興桐鄉間的有名的產品。</p>
<p>嘉興桐鄉一帶，春秋時候地名就叫檇李，這果木蕃植到現在，可見已有幾千年的歷史了。說不定，與吴越地方的開闢，有同樣的悠久。那末，我們名檇李為吴越一帶的地方果，比於「國花」，「市花」之例，想也没有什麼不妥當吧。</p>
<p>這檇李却有特别的記號，你看它的底部，就有着斜行的凹紋，相傳就是西施的指爪痕，因為西施是最愛吃檇李的。</p>
<p>檇李的吃法，不和别的李子一樣，不管成熟不成熟，送入嘴裏就啃，總是差不多的味道。檇李倘若也照這樣吃法，那就要說你太外行了，或是不懂吃檇李的藝術。</p>
<p>怎麼吃法呢？培植檇李有經驗的可園氏，告訴我說，「檇李熟了，顏色就會由青轉黄，但還不能吃，你得把它藏在瓷器裏，用蓋蓋好，約三四日，把蓋揭開，就會發出一股酒香氣，這就是檇李報告你已經可吃了。但還得看它的顏色，是否全個變成胭脂紅？又得用手撮動，是否全個軟得如同柿子？如果色，香，味，觸四部都覺得完全無缺了，你就可用針在皮上刺一小孔，以口吸之，所含甘露，就會被你吸盡，直到剩一張皮，一個核為止。要這樣的吃法，才能領略檇李的真真滋味。那生吞活剥的啃，對别的李子或可以，對檇李是萬萬不行的。」</p>
<p>中國人最愛吃，吃要有吃的藝術，檇李的吃法，就是最合於藝術的。</p>
<h3 id="c99">住的衛生 <a href="#c99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— 愛農</p>
<p>在炎熱的夏天，住的一項，最易發生問題，蚊子臭虫採取空陸兩方面夾攻戰略，在屋中猖獗非凡，而尤其在孤島上寸金之地，近幾天被這些飛機（蚊子）和坦克車（臭虫）打擊，已不堪設想的了。在那些鴿棚一般的房間中，日光難得光顧，而裏面的熱氣像蒸籠般的可怕，那些磨牙吮血的害虫，當然是得了一個良好的機會，而更有我們肉眼不能看見的病菌，也在繁殖它們的種族。在這樣四面楚歌的環境中，無時無刻不是有引起疾病的可能，因此我們對於住的衛生，確有不得不注意的必要。</p>
<p>我們要使房間的窗户大，而且數目要多，頂好把窗户打開，使日光可以自由的進來，如果陽光充足，滿室明亮，使人精神爽快，而且對於健康上也極有益，因為日光是一劑消毒藥，凡是病菌見了日光，便不能生存，窗子一定要開，因為日光殺菌的紫外線不能從玻璃中透過，窗一開，它的殺菌力便要打一個八折九扣了。地板要常常拖洗，這樣可以減少灰塵，因為它是傳染疾病的媒介，如果水中滴了一些臭藥水，更可驅除蒼蠅跳蛋等的蹤跡，而在潮濕的牆角裏多多的澆灑臭藥水，確有意想不到的功效。窗檻上，椅桌上積滿了一層厚厚的塵埃，切不可用雞毛帚去撣，如果一撣，反使塵埃飛散開來，倒還是不要多此一舉了，共實塵埃並没有驅除，不過使它們搬一個場而已，所以必須要用潮濕的揩桌布輕輕地把它抹去，是最妥當的了，晚上的窗不要關上，但也不要全部打開，最好帶開一二扇，那是要看房間的大小，和屋中住人的多寡而定，不過一扇是一定要打開的。這上述的幾點，都是最淺簡的住的衛生，但反容易被人忽略的。</p>

<p>一個人生活在世界上，好像是做學生，天天受教育一樣，而且是「做到老，學不了」的。在上帝所創造的世界中，也只有人類纔能學習。其他如蜘蛛的結網，蜜蜂的做巢，都是牠們的本能，生下來就會的，無所謂學習！即說人類總能學習，到底是學習什麼呢？猶太國有一位先知名叫以賽亞的告訴我們說，人類應當學習行善。要想學習行善。先當從自己的思想中，除去一切不善，因為思想是事實之母，没有思想不善，而其行為能善的。我們如果要學習行善，有三點應當注意：</p>
<p>（一）學習行善，須有以為模範——誰是我們的模範呢？古今中外，雖有許多聖賢哲士，然而誰都有些缺點，不能稱為完人。能稱得起完人的，惟有萬流景仰的耶穌基督。這並非基督教徒過分推舉自己的師尊，就是耶穌自己而已，也會問過他的仇敵說：「你們中間誰能指證我有罪呢？」所以我們不想學習行善就罷了，如果要學習行善，唯一的模範，就是耶穌基督。</p>
<p>（二）學習行善，須有學習的本領——我們常說某人有天才，某人有本領。如果人們凡是事必須靠天才，没有學習的本領，那真太没有希望了。但學習的本領，從哪裏來的呢？我們知道這本領，是與耶穌發生關傒而有的。因為耶穌是為了行善，竭力與罪惡奮鬥，而至終得勝罪惡的。置人於死地，是罪惡的唯一手段，但耶穌雖被釘死在十字架上，他却從死後復活了。所以我們要得着抵抗罪惡，學習行善的本領，非與耶穌連合不可。</p>
<p>（三）學習行善，貴在實行——我們有了行善的模範有了學習的本領，還要在我們的生活上，躬行實踐。「你們要行道，不要單單聽到…，」這是古信徒給我們的勉勵。我們既然知道何為行善，何為惡以後，就當立刻止住惡，積極行善，否則就要像王陽明先生所說：「知而不行，只是未知」了。</p>

<p>朋友！你覺的自己有罪麼？普世的人有同樣的心理：就是是己非人，自以為義，不知道在上主的面前都是罪人。聖經說：「没有義人，連一個也没有，没有明白的，没有尋求神的，都是偏離正路，一同變為無用；没有行善的，連一個也没有」。又說：我們在罪學裏生的，在母親懷胎的時候就有了罪。因為我們生在罪孽中，所以最歡喜去犯罪。倘若我們没有罪，耶穌可以不必來，上主差祂的兒子到世上來，就是要拯救罪人。耶穌拯救罪人不藉教育；因為教育只能發展固有的天才，不能改革人心；倘使惡者受教育，無異供給盜匪以槍械，因為越聰明就越易犯罪，學問益高作惡的可能益大，耶穌拯救罪人甚至不藉道德，因為道德只能範圍人在正軌上走，而不能把有罪的人變作無罪。耶穌拯救罪人是舍了自己的生命，釘死在十字架上。叫那無罪的，代替有罪的死了，使有罪的得在神的面前稱為無罪。這是人所不易理解的一件事實。請聽保羅的見證，「在罪人中我是個罪魁」。「我所願意的善我反不作，不願意的惡我倒去作……我真是苦啊！誰能救我脱離這取死的身體呢？感謝神，靠着我們的主耶穌基督就能脱離了」。其他如彼得，約翰，奧占斯丁，路得馬丁，術斯理……及至近代的基督徒，都因信了耶穌，生活大變，能從罪惡中出來，不但自己得救，樂享永生，且而造福的人類，名留史册。耶穌真是罪人的救主。</p>

<p>老毛忽把嘴唇一弩，那雙鼠目變了幾變，鼻子裏哼了一聲。「那還不是鈔票作怪？他每次來過夜，金梅總有進賬，二十塊十塊。那自然會把伊的嘴塞住啦。」「你却没有進賬？是不是？」「我不要他的錢。我雖窮，却不願做奸細，不願意用這樣的錢！我不是為了没進賬才瞎說他。那姓趙的有一次會給我兩塊錢，我也没有拿。」</p>
<p>霍桑忽又抬頭接嘴說：「唉，這個姓趙的你覺得怎樣？」</p>
<p>老毛緊蹙着眉毛，彷佛一時回答不出，頓了一頓，才說：「這——這個人我也說不出什麼。他在這裏出進，還不過半個多月的事，好像是王小姐的新朋友，不過交情却像比老朋友還厚。」</p>
<p>「你怎麼知道？」</p>
<p>「他在陸經理不在的時候出進時很忙，有時一天會跑兩三次。他一來，王小姐總是眉花眼笑地歡迎他。並且那一次王小姐跟姓余的大閙，也就為的他。」他忽伸一伸舌頭，聳一聳肩，扮了一個鬼臉。「醋罐兒打翻，王小姐却廻護着他！」</p>
<p>「他在這裏歇過夜嗎？」</p>
<p>老毛摇頭道：「這倒没有，不過——」</p>
<p>「不過什麼？」</p>
<p>老毛又舔着嘴脣，忽現出一種忸怩的神氣，好像有什麼話說不出口，不過不像先前那麼的害怕。</p>
<p>霍桑又催逼着道：「說啊，不過什麼？」</p>
<p>老毛低聲道：「有時候王小姐也許——也許會送上門去。」</p>

<p>— 史偉</p>
<p>「現在上海生活程度真高呵！米要賣六七十元一擔哩」</p>
<p>「從前六元錢一月的亭子間，現在要二十元啦。呵！生活程度真高哪！」</p>
<p>讀者們！你以為前面這些話對不對？你說對嗎？但我說，有對的，也有不對的。</p>
<p>為什麼呢？</p>
<p>因為，對的，是所說的米價高漲與房租增加都是事實。不對的，是把物價高漲與生活程度混為一談了。</p>
<p>那末甚麼是生活程度呢？</p>
<p>生活程度就是生活水准，是指人們的物質生活的享受而言；譬如我們說，美國職工的生活程度比中國高，這就是說，美國職工的物質享受比中國職工來的優越；但蘇聯職工的生活程度比美國更高，這就是說，蘇聯職工的衣食住行等都比美國來的舒齊；從國內講，上海人的生活程度比鄉下人來得高。因為，衣食方面比鄉下人來的講究，住的方面比鄉下人來的舒適：有電燈，自來水……。行的方面，不像鄉下人那樣，十幾里路還是安步當車；上海人則半里路還要搭電車……諸如此類，各方面的享受都超過鄉下人的。</p>
<p>這樣，我就要來問你：假使你在戰前吃十幾元一旦大米的，但現在大米要六七十元一擔了：可是這六七十元一擔的大米是否比戰前十幾元一擔的大米多了一些還是好了一些？没有多也没有好吧？（也許少了一些與壞了一些！）這樣就明白了，你化了很多的代價，但所得的依舊一樣；這就是說，你的生活費用增加了，但你的生活程度並没有提高。</p>
<p>那末物價幾時會跌，與生活程度幾時能提高呢？</p>
<p>關於物價高漲的原因，正像大家所了解的一樣；一半為了「統制」與投機，一半為了戰事關系。（因為一個國家在進行戰爭的時候，其人民生活不能相同於平時，是必然的。）但這里有個矛盾現象，就是有許多商號公司却因物價高漲而賺了許多錢，這與職工生活的惡化剛成個反比例。這一問題是應該予以正視的。</p>
<p>物價會跌，但也許不會跌，可是這是不成問題的；能夠肯定的是我們生活程度必然會提高。但這還待我們去爭取！路祗有一條，就是今天大多數中國人所走的一條。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Should the Yunnan-Burma Road Be Closed? China Has the Right to Demand its Opening; Grew Continues Talks with the Japanese Foreign Minister; Britain Has No Intention of Abandoning its Interests in the Far East <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – Today, news was received here that the Chinese government has repeatedly notified the British government in recent weeks of its deep concern regarding negotiations between Britain and Japan to block the transportation of war materials via the Yunnan-Burma Road to Chongqing. Chinese officials here solemnly assert that China has the right to demand the continued opening of the Yunnan-Burma Road to facilitate traffic. The Yunnan-Burma Road is one of Chongqing's only important transportation lines to the outside world. If Sino-British friendship is to be maintained, then this route must continue to be open. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned yesterday from responsible sources in London that talks between the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and the Japanese Foreign Minister, Hachiro Arita, regarding the Yunnan-Burma Road issue, are still ongoing. Various proposals are under consideration. In the coming days, further talks on these proposals will continue in Tokyo. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>London – The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times stated that well-informed sources in London are expressing cautious optimism regarding the outcome of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the Burma Road. It is reported that the British side has made various concerted efforts to seek a solution to this problem, and the same applies to the Hong Kong issue. Regarding Japan's request to halt the shipment of arms from Hong Kong to China, it should be noted that this situation has already ceased since 1939. Therefore, the Burma Road issue has become the focus of attention, and a proposal is currently under consideration to temporarily restrict the transport of certain types of goods for approximately three months, coinciding with the rainy season, when freight volume is at its lowest. This suspension would allow time for continued negotiations on this and other issues. Britain has always desired the restoration of peace in the Far East on fair terms, but Britain has no intention of abandoning treaty rights, and China has no reason to fear that Britain will abandon its neutral status to its disadvantage. It would be a mistake to assume that this indicates the beginning of a major concession policy that would seriously affect Britain's position in the Far East. The current arrangement, if agreed upon, would only be temporary in nature, and future developments will largely depend on events occurring on the Asian and European fronts. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Britain Should Adopt a Firm Stance</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Central Daily News recently asserted that Japan's demands to block the Burma Road and pressure Hong Kong are empty threats. It advocates that the British government adopt a firm stance in dealing with its relations with Japan. The newspaper stated that the Japanese claim that blocking the Burma Road or other routes would lead to China's defeat is merely an illusion. The Chinese government has notified London to pay attention to the following two points: First, China has the right to demand the continued maintenance of the Burma Road. Second, maintaining the Burma Road is an important element in determining the future of Sino-British friendship. The British government will undoubtedly give full attention to these two points.

Another unit launched a surprise attack on the Japanese troops entrenched on Zhendian Mountain on the night of the 2nd, killing over a hundred Japanese troops and thoroughly destroying nearby transportation routes. Furthermore, the Japanese troops entrenched at Yanghe have repeatedly been attacked by Chinese troops, suffering heavy casualties. The besieged Japanese troops in various strongholds are cowering in their fortifications, afraid to move, and are in a state of extreme panic. The Chinese continue their attacks. (14th)</p>

After two hours of intense fighting, many Japanese troops were killed. Subsequently, to lure the Japanese, the Chinese troops retreated to the left and right, waiting for the Japanese to enter the trap set by the Chinese. They then immediately launched a pincer attack on the Japanese, inflicting heavy losses until 4 PM. The Japanese left corpses all over the field and retreated towards Xiatangji. The Chinese are currently tracking them down for further annihilation. In this battle, over three hundred Japanese troops were killed, and many spoils of war were captured. (14th)</p>

<h3 id="e15">The Issue of Blocking the Yunnan-Burma Road <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Japanese demand to Britain for the blocking of transport on the Yunnan-Burma Road, after Britain once righteously refused, the Japanese still expressed dissatisfaction, even resorting to intimidation by taking harsh measures. Their ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, in talks with the British Foreign Secretary, Lord Halifax, even threatened that Britain's attitude would strengthen the measures of radical elements in Tokyo. Under this dual policy of the Japanese side, it is said that recently the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has reached a compromise with Hachiro Arita, agreeing to periodically close the Yunnan-Burma Road. While this has not yet been announced by either side, we have various reasons not to believe that Britain would actually yield. If, unfortunately, the facts are indeed as reported, it would be another serious failure for Britain in the Far East. We truly do not know how the British side will explain its repeated statements that its Far Eastern policy remains unchanged, nor how it will explain the sacred obligations it bears regarding treaties and League of Nations resolutions. Even the arguments for Britain's involvement in the European war would inevitably be self-defeating.</p>
<p>The transport capacity of the Yunnan-Burma Road itself is not very large, and driving on it is even more difficult during the rainy season. Therefore, as an important outlet to the sea in southwestern China, the Yunnan-Burma Road is perhaps far less important than other routes that the Japanese cannot interfere with. Moreover, China's war of resistance mainly relies on self-reliance. After three years of operation and construction in the rear, everything is moving towards self-sufficiency. International routes of communication with the outside world certainly have their value, but they are by no means as critical to China's war of resistance as the Japanese claim. The Japanese have been unable to make any progress in their military aggression against China, and have instead turned their anger on third countries. Since this time last year, they have been loudly proclaiming that "assistance to China's war of resistance by third countries is not something that Japan can tolerate," shifting the responsibility for the failure of their aggression to third countries. Anti-British movements and the like have also emerged in response, forming an important part of Japan's attempt to dominate East Asia. In fact, the extent to which so-called third-country assistance plays a role in China's war of resistance is demonstrated by the facts. Especially since the outbreak of the European war, the great powers have been preoccupied with their own affairs and have little surplus energy to assist China, and China has not suffered any particular impact as a result. This time, Britain's agreement to block the Yunnan-Burma Road is said to be for a period of two or three months, which in Britain's explanation may be considered not to cause too much damage to China during the rainy season. However, China's strong opposition to the blockade is based on moral reasons that outweigh economic needs.</p>
<p>The Japanese demand to block China's international routes of communication has no legal basis whatsoever. Since they have not actually declared war, they are certainly not entitled to the rights of a belligerent. Japan itself needs to rely on the import of gasoline and scrap iron from abroad, but it wants to cut off legal trade by third countries to China. Britain has always had ample reasons to refuse this contradictory logic. Vietnam, because France was defeated and surrendered, the entire country is almost unable to protect itself. Although its submission to Japan is inappropriate, it can be勉强 considered excusable. In the West, Britain has called for uncompromising resistance to aggression. If, in the Far East, it were to reverse its position and support the unreasonable demands of the aggressors, disregarding its past promises and international obligations, this, judging by the current complex international interests, would not necessarily be a wise move. The strong reaction it would provoke in the countries concerned in the Far East would also have a significant adverse impact on Britain's current situation.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that Britain is currently in a difficult period. The imminent German and Italian offensives have left Britain with no time to consider anything other than how to cope with the war. However, the delicate situation in the Far East is by no means one where sacrificing China's rights to satisfy Japanese demands can lead to temporary security. The kind of diplomatic language used by Shigemitsu mentioned above may be more effective than the empty threats of the Japanese military. In fact, whether the Japanese will follow the will of the extremist elements and change their attitude towards the European war depends on the evolution of the overall national situation, and on the actual strength of Japan itself. The inability of Britain's capitulation to Japanese demands to affect Japan's basic policy is just like the inability of the closure of China's international routes to shake China's stance in the war of resistance. Even in terms of Japan's southward advance policy, its painstaking planning and active arrangements have not been shifted by the various concessions made by Britain, France, the Netherlands, and India to Japan recently.</p>
<p>The importance of the Yunnan-Burma Road itself is certainly not as described by the Japanese, but it is the last channel for free China to have maritime communication with Europe and the United States, and it is also an artery symbolizing Sino-British friendship. The opening of the road has brought Sino-British relations closer, and if the road is truly closed, it will inevitably cast a dark shadow on the friendship between the two sides. At the very least, it will make people who love both China and Britain re-evaluate everything about Britain. However, we are convinced that the negotiations being conducted by Craigie undoubtedly run counter to the views of the vast majority of Britons. Churchill has always been known for his wisdom, and in the past, when he was in opposition, he often made grand pronouncements about helping China. He should not repeat Chamberlain's unfortunate mistakes. Over the past ten years, the decline of the British Empire's authority and the erosion of its interests in the Far East have not been less serious than in the West. If it is no longer possible to deal with the aggressors with a firm stance, and only concessions and compromises are seen as a good strategy, then taking one step forward while also taking a step backward, it will inevitably encounter greater threats and difficulties in the East in the not-too-distant future. On the other hand, Britain should have a correct assessment of China's magnificent manpower and material resources, the abundance of its potential resources, and the greatness of its national prospects. At the same time, it should also consider to what extent it needs to maintain relations with China in the future. Britain is a friend of China, but it is not the only friend. We earnestly hope that Britain will seriously and carefully consider this great nation of 450 million people!</p>

<p>Making persistent efforts, the morale and popular sentiment in the northern and southern battlefields are becoming increasingly enthusiastic, and the arrival of final victory is increasingly evident as it is not far off. The following is a brief overview of the important achievements on various fronts:</p>
<p>Hubei and Hunan</p>
<p>In Hubei Province, the Chinese troops have reported victories on all fronts in the past week. Japanese troops in the area west of the Xiang River, since the night of the 6th, have been surrounded and attacked by Chinese forces in the northeastern area near the suburbs of Yichang. Thousands of Japanese troops have been killed. Important Japanese commanders such as Regimental Commander Shibata, Battalion Commanders Ishikawa and Yoshikawa, and Lieutenant Colonel Teikawa Ansei, and many others, were killed in this battle. This is the first time that the Japanese troops have suffered a major blow from the Chinese forces since crossing the river to invade the west. Corresponding to this victorious battle are the fierce attacks on Suixian in central Hubei, the clearing of the remnants of Japanese troops from Dabie Mountain, and the cutting off of Japanese traffic on the Hanyi Road. In eastern Hubei, the attack on Huangpi, the largest stronghold of the Japanese troops, poses a major threat to the Japanese troops in Wuhan. In southern Hunan, the siege of Chongyang has also been launched and is approaching Chengning, all of which have been successful, with countless enemy troops killed. As for the Chinese troops in northern Hunan, in the past week, they have repeatedly inflicted heavy blows on the Japanese boats that have invaded the Maoshai shop lake area, sinking many of them. Another unit has been advancing. After recovering Xinpu Village, they have advanced to the outskirts of Linxiang County. The Japanese army</p>
<p>Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Chinese Military Commission stated that the beginning of this week coincided with the third anniversary of the sacred war of resistance. Our seasoned soldiers, the Yue road transportation industry has been completely controlled by the Chinese.</p>
<p>Guangxi and Guangdong</p>
<p>The Japanese troops who invaded southern Guangxi are taking risks in the mountainous areas around Longzhou, where the Chinese are expected to annihilate the Japanese. In the past week, the various Chinese armies have bravely launched their attacks, striking from the sides, attacking in circles, and surrounding the enemy. The Japanese have suffered heavy casualties, and a decisive battle is now underway. At the same time, the Chinese forces behind the Japanese have taken advantage of the situation to attack Yangmei near Nanning, posing a great threat to the Japanese rear. The Chinese are now continuing to expand their victories. In Guangdong Province, the Japanese troops besieged in the Shenzhen area are unable to move because the surrounding traffic routes are controlled by the Chinese. In Hainan Island, the Chinese troops have been attacking the Japanese in the two cities of Jinshan Lake and Hushan (both belonging to Wenchang) for days, killing and wounding many Japanese troops and destroying many Japanese vehicles. The Chinese forces are still continuing their attacks. The long-dormant southern front has now become active again.</p>
<p>Henan and Shanxi</p>
<p>Since the Chinese troops in eastern Henan entered Kaifeng at the end of last month, good news has been pouring in. The puppet troops of various units have all rushed to express their loyalty and support. Among those who have sent telegrams declaring their defection are Zhang Renjie, Cao Dazhong, Li Zhongyi, Song Kebin, and other units of the puppet troops' largest force, the Peace and National Salvation Army, with over 20,000 men and guns. At that time, they joined forces with the Chinese troops to attack the Japanese army, and successively captured important cities and towns such as Zhuxian Town, Shangqiu, Yucheng, Chongcheng, Luyi, and Boxian. They also besieged Huaiyang and Tongxu counties, bombed the railway bridge markers in the Maji to Dangshan area, and thoroughly destroyed the Tongchen Highway. In total, they recovered hundreds of miles of lost territory and annihilated 5,000 Japanese soldiers. All of these are the miraculous achievements of these patriots who are deeply committed to serving the country. As for the Japanese troops in northwestern Shanxi, since mid-last month, they have ventured deep and invaded the vicinity of Kelan, Xingxian, Linxian, Baode, and other places in various routes. They have been ambushed by Chinese troops, with considerable gains. In the two battles near Miyu Town and Baode, over a thousand Japanese troops were killed in each battle. The remnants of the Japanese troops fled eastward. In southeastern Shanxi, over 2,000 Japanese troops invading Liuping from Jincheng have been engaged in fierce battles with Chinese forces in the area south of Liuping for days. One unit had fled to the vicinity of Zhangzhuang, where it was heavily attacked by the Chinese forces and many Japanese troops were killed. On the morning of the 7th, the remnants of the Japanese troops broke through to the north. That night, the Chinese pursuit troops recovered Liuping. The nearby remnants of the Japanese troops have been completely cleared.</p>
<p>Anhui and Jiangxi</p>
<p>There have been fierce battles on all fronts in Anhui Province this week. After recovering Guichi, the Chinese troops in southern Anhui continued to attack and recover the two strongholds of Changanbu and Nanshan near Yinjia Village. The Japanese troops who reinforced their counterattacks have been defeated. The Japanese troops who invaded Hanshan in central Anhui were ambushed by Chinese troops along the way, and the Japanese suffered heavy casualties. Now, the Chinese troops are taking advantage of the victory to advance towards Qingxi. The Chinese troops in northern Anhui used mobile units to attack Shouxian, once storming into the city, killing and wounding many Japanese troops, and burning down many Japanese warehouses and puppet agencies. The outer defenses of Nanchang and Wuning in Jiangxi Province are still under our control. The Japanese troops are strengthening their fortifications, attempting to hold out. The Chinese forces are still seeking opportunities to attack.</p>
<p>In addition,</p>
<p>Suiyuan Province</p>
<p>The Chinese forces captured the Chai Deng Zhao stronghold south of Baotou.</p>
<p>Northern Shandong</p>
<p>The Chinese forces captured Puyang County and besieged Weixian and Boxing.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>The Chinese forces attacked Chen Village, which belongs to Guanyun, with great intensity. The puppet troops under Wei Guolian took the opportunity to defect. The Chinese forces swept through the Japanese troops who were operating along the Jingwu line in southern Jiangsu, killing and wounding over a thousand.</p>
<p>Japanese aircraft have raided Chongqing several times in recent days, but have been repeatedly repelled with heavy losses. These are all important achievements in the past week. This special report is hereby attached. (13th)</p>

<p>Luoyang – After the Chinese troops in southeastern Shanxi recovered Zhang Village, southwest of Jincheng, they continued to pursue the Japanese troops towards Liuping and Hetaoyuan on the 7th.

<p>Washington. It was claimed here last night that the United States has now obtained countless major raw materials not produced in the United States. In the event of an emergency, the United States will no longer have to rely on foreign imports. Stetinius, Chairman of the Self-Defense Raw Materials Committee under the auspices of President Roosevelt, said that after two weeks of efforts, the committee has obtained all important raw materials. Stetinius also said that before the end of this month, the United States will be able to manufacture artificial rubber to prevent the source of natural rubber from being cut off. He said, "We are completing our work, and the situation is more promising than we expected six weeks ago." There are various methods for making artificial rubber, which have moved beyond the experimental stage. The raw materials for this method are easily available in the country. Stetinius also announced that last Monday, he received a notice from the government stating that large quantities of tungsten and antimony had been discovered near Vietnam. He continued, "On the day the notice was received, the Economic Rehabilitation Corporation immediately purchased all of the tungsten and antimony there. Today, these raw materials are being transported on British ships along the Pacific Ocean to the United States." (14th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>New York.

In the future, the United States will no longer have to rely on foreign rubber supplies. The committee has been in contact with various companies researching artificial methods, examining the methods they have obtained, which have exceeded the experimental stage and reached the point where the establishment of factories for manufacturing can be considered. He knows that Goodyear, DuPont, and Standard Oil of New Jersey are currently engaged in the production of artificial rubber on an experimental basis. (14th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e21">US Retired Military Officer Makes Remarks, Actually Advocates US-Japan "Understanding" to Prevent Alliance with Axis Powers <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>New York. Retired US Navy Rear Admiral Stirling recently made remarks advocating a US-Japan "understanding." According to him, Japan is currently maintaining its neutrality in the European war, but it may join the Axis powers at any time. If Japan joins the Axis powers, it will be unfavorable to Britain and the United States. This issue is not a question of compromising with Japan. As far as I know, Japan intends to become the hegemon of East Asia and the neighboring areas of the Pacific. If Japan can properly carry out its ambitious plans in this part of the world, it will completely transform economically, and it will also undergo some changes politically and militarily. The result may be the formation of a union of peoples working together, at which time Japan may become a very large military power, preventing any foreign aggression and making East Asia an Asia for Asians. The problems faced by Britain and France are now more serious than those faced by us. The British navy in Hong Kong has been threatened by the Japanese army, and the British concession in Tianjin has no power. Japanese inspectors have been stationed in French Vietnam, and the Japanese are increasing their control over the French concession in Shanghai. In the Dutch East Indies, the Japanese have obtained various concessions, which they still feel are insufficient, and recently they have made more demands, hoping to enjoy a large part of the commerce of those rich islands. As I see it, the problem today is to prevent Japan from adopting a policy of complete cooperation with the Axis powers, and to make the Japanese believe that Japan's interests depend on cooperation with Britain and the United States. If Japan is at odds with Britain and the United States, it will never be able to maintain stability in East Asia. We have ample resources to build a huge navy, which Japan cannot hope to match, and in the current military expansion, Japan's military will soon lag behind. I believe that the first thing that Britain and France should do is to recognize their possessions in East Asia and return all their possessions in China and Hong Kong to China after satisfactory conditions are set, which would greatly eliminate the danger of Japanese aggression. As for the United States, it should begin negotiations with Japan on a basic treaty to replace the treaty that was abolished last January, and must find a way to normalize US-Japan relations. It should be noted that if Germany invades England and wins, all our land, sea, and air forces will be used to deal with threats from Europe. If we can do this sincerely, the Pacific side of the United States can be kept safe. (14th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo. The Nichinichi Shimbun advocates a military alliance between Germany and Japan, saying that Japan must make this alliance the highest goal of its foreign policy. The newspaper also stated that this alliance will enable Japan to carry out its southward advance policy and ensure the economic group of East Asia, and should be completed before Germany begins its general offensive against Britain. Japan can then adjust its relations with the Soviet Union based on the precedent of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. The newspaper also urged the government to adopt an active attitude toward resolutely implementing the southward advance policy, and if necessary, use force, and disregard the possibility of deteriorating US-Japan relations.

<p>British Air Force Fiercely Attacks Two German Naval Ports</p>
<p>London. On Friday night and Saturday morning, British aircraft attacked the ports of Emden and Kiel, and the bombing was the most intense that those two German naval bases had encountered since the start of the war. Other targets, such as airfields outside Berlin, military targets in the Rhine region, and ships in Belgium, were also bombed. British aircraft attacked Emden, dropping about 20 tons of heavy bombs, fiercely bombing gasoline depots, factories, and docks, with fires and explosions in many places. Although the anti-aircraft fire was fierce, it failed to prevent British aircraft from hitting their targets. Other British aircraft flew to Kiel to bomb shipyards, causing explosions and fires. Yesterday at dawn, the British Air Force resumed its offensive, first attacking the Berlin airfield, bombing military targets in the Rhine region, and concentrating on ships in the canal between Belarus and Ostend in Belgium. British fighter planes engaged in several battles with German aircraft over the Strait of Dover, shooting down three German bombers and three fighters. Subsequently, British fighter planes shot down another German bomber. According to the Ministry of Aviation, a total of twelve German aircraft were destroyed yesterday, including six bombers and six fighters. The British side lost only one fighter. The first major air battle yesterday occurred shortly after noon, when a small squadron of Hurricane British fighters, patrolling at an altitude of about four miles above the sea, engaged with about 20 incoming German aircraft, shooting down one Taunil German bomber. The other fighters in the British squadron then engaged with Messerschmitt 109 German fighters protecting the bombers, shooting down two of them and damaging several others. Subsequently, more German aircraft surrounded and attacked ships in the Strait, and two were shot down by British fighter planes. Two hours later, German Junkers bombers, protected by fighter planes, attacked a convoy off the southeast coast and were heavily attacked by British fighter planes and anti-aircraft guns.

<p>German and Italian Naval and Air Forces Active in Recent Days</p>
<p>Berlin. Huitong News Agency military correspondent Stieffried recently described the situation of the European war in the recent week (July 6 to July 13), stating that there was no contact between the German and British armies in the past week. On the contrary, the German naval and air forces have formed the most ideal line of attack against Britain from Scandinavia to the Pyrenees. During the Norwegian war, German submarines also participated in the battle, so there were no significant results in the commercial war at that time. In the past six weeks, German submarines have been very active in the commercial war, and a total of more than 600,000 tons of enemy merchant ships have been sunk or destroyed, averaging 100,000 tons sunk per week. The German Air Force is still preparing to attack Britain, but the excellent tactics of the Air Force have gained obvious evidence. The success of the British Air Force in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and western Germany is weaker than the achievements of the German Air Force in bombing its naval fleet, merchant ships, harbors, gas stations, airfields, and arsenals. Judging from the battle situation in the past few days, Germany seems to be about to launch a major offensive. Since the establishment of the armistice agreement between France and Italy, Britain's position in the Mediterranean has become more unfavorable. Since losing the port of Bizerte in Tunisia, France, Britain's naval base between Alexandria and Gibraltar is only Malta, but the location of Malta is within the bombing range of the Italian Air Force. The Italian maritime fortress of Pantelleria and submarines block the passage between Sicily and Tunisia, now with remarkable results. On July 8 and 9, Britain gathered its naval fleets from Alexandria and Gibraltar, attempting to attack the Italian coast. The navy that set out from Gibraltar was eventually repelled by the Italian Air Force. The navy that set out from Alexandria, including three Baham-class battleships and one aircraft carrier, was defeated by the Italian Navy and Air Force in the Ionian Sea. From this point of view, the British Navy cannot exert its power once it encounters the official army. Britain's position is now becoming increasingly dangerous, while Germany's position is becoming more and more favorable. Since the conquest of France, Germany has no worries about being attacked from the front and back, and can do whatever it wants to attack Britain. (14th Huitong dispatch)</p>
<p>German-Italian Naval Battle Results in the Past Week</p>
<p>Berlin. Huitong News Agency naval correspondent Vice Admiral Pfeiffer recently described the naval battle situation in the recent week (July 6 to July 13), stating that German submarines are very successful in the commercial war, and the naval battle in the Ionian Sea is the major event in the past week. In the past six weeks, German submarines have sunk a total of 609,000 tons of enemy ships. The reason why German submarines can achieve such results is that German submarines are now mostly active in the Atlantic Ocean and the English Channel. Although the Atlantic coast of France and the ports of the English Channel have been damaged by the war, Germany can still use them as bases for light naval fleets. Moreover, the seaports and docks from the Pyrenees to Helde are not only related to the war, but can also be used to manufacture ships and machinery. In addition, Germany's own shipyards and the shipyards of Norway and Denmark can also be used by Germany to manufacture ships. Therefore, the loss of British ships is increasing day by day, and the complete blockade of the British Isles by Germany is a major concern. Since the war, Britain has lost 4.3 million tons of ships, of which 300,000 tons have been severely damaged and are no longer usable. The British-Italian naval battle in the Ionian Sea is the second major event in the past week. On July 7, the British naval fleet set out from the port of Alexandria in an attempt to attack the Italian coast, and was detected by Italian reconnaissance aircraft. According to the Italian pilots, the British fleet included three battleships, one aircraft carrier, and many cruisers and destroyers. At the same time, Italian aircraft discovered that a British fleet was also advancing toward the Italian coast in the west. The Italian naval fleet then set out to meet the enemy. The British main cruiser "Hood," the largest warship in the world, was hit by two bombs and immediately caught fire. It is heard that the ship has now been towed back to England, because the shipyards in Malta and Gibraltar are not large enough to accommodate the ship for repairs. The warships led by the cruiser were blocked by the Italian Air Force and could not advance. After that, the Italian main warships fired artillery, and a torpedo fleet, protected by aircraft, attacked the enemy ships. The British fleet's formation was disrupted, and they fled eastward in disorder. Italy then pursued with aircraft and continued bombing. The three British battleships are all "Baham" class, each with 31,000 tons, equipped with eight 38 cm cannons, with a speed of 25 miles per hour, and each ship has 1,200 officers and men. Their strength is stronger than that of the Italian main warships, but as a result, they were defeated by the Italian fleet. This shows that the British Navy has been greatly weakened. According to the Italian report, only one Italian main warship was slightly damaged, and one torpedo boat was lost. The British had one main warship sunk by the Italian fleet and was unable to fire its guns. Near Crete, one British cruiser was destroyed by a bomb, and one destroyer was destroyed by an Italian submarine. Five aircraft launched from the British aircraft carrier were shot down by the Italian side. The good results achieved by Italy in this first British-Italian naval battle prove the strength of the Italian naval and air forces. (14th Huitong dispatch)</p>

<p>Vichy: President Lebrun's secretary, Magre, told reporters yesterday that President Lebrun has not yet submitted his resignation because, according to the first four articles of the constitution declared by General Pétain, he does not know to whom he should submit his resignation. According to people close to President Lebrun, although he approves of General Pétain's decision to adopt a totalitarian system, he still hopes to maintain his position under the new system. Magre continued that President Lebrun now intends to retire to his son-in-law's home in Vizille, near Grenoble, to live a civilian life. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Unity Party Platform Drafted</p>
<p>Vichy: According to sources close to Deputy Déat, the outline of the French Unity Party has been drafted in the past forty-eight hours. Déat previously published an article arguing that "we should not sacrifice for Danzig," which attracted attention from all sectors. Deputies Déat, Bergery, Vienot, Dumanchin, and Pathe refused to join Marshal Pétain's new cabinet because they believed that a new political party should be formed, which Laval's cabinet would need to seek help from in the future, and which could make the totalitarian national movement support France's new totalitarian government. Currently, some old political parties in parliament have expressed their willingness to participate in the organization of the party. Not only Flandin and Marin and members of the Socialist Party, but also Daladier's Radical Socialist Party have requested to join the party. There are many rumors about the new Unity Party, but its political platform can give a rough idea. The details are as follows: (1) France is an agricultural nation, and its colonies should be developed according to the principles of agricultural policy. Protecting farmers and preventing them from fleeing is the government's urgent task. (2) France's relations with neighboring countries must be based on its status as an agricultural nation. Competition with German industry must be avoided as much as possible. France's industry should be reduced in order to participate in the planned European economic system. (3) French youth must participate in youth organizations sponsored by the government, and their work is to serve the land and forced labor. (4) France belongs to the French people. A friendly policy towards immigrants must be stopped. France must eliminate all foreigners. (5) New marriage laws should prohibit French men and women from marrying other races, especially Jews and colonial peoples. (6) New labor laws, labor courts, and attention to workers' rest time must enhance the social status of French workers. Selecting talented children to attend senior schools, unifying the school system, changing the school curriculum, and emphasizing agriculture are necessary to change France's social organization.

<p>Civilians Fleeing Toulon</p>
<p>Marseille: According to news received here last night, thousands of French civilians fled Toulon yesterday, fearing that the British Mediterranean Fleet might bombard the area on French Democracy Day. The evacuation of the city was completed late last night. Although most residents only moved outside the city, thousands have moved to other cities. French army officers demarcated several dangerous areas, as the British may concentrate their attacks on these areas in an attempt to destroy important military equipment. All residents in the dangerous areas were forcibly evacuated. French military personnel stationed in Toulon were prohibited from drinking alcohol yesterday. This ban was also implemented on civilians staying in the city at night. It is said that the ban was issued by Deputy Commander De Vin to "maintain morale" in the event of a British naval attack.

<p>The Process of Change in the French Political System</p>
<p>Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Professor McKay recently recounted to a United Press reporter the historical process from the establishment of the First French Republic to its recent transformation into a totalitarian state. He said that France has now bowed to the brutal Nazi forces and has paid a heavy price for its lack of preparation. France's defeat was due to its excessive love of a good life, and it has now paid the price in a shameful defeat, and as a result, its democratic system has been completely destroyed. The French Senate and Chamber of Deputies have now unanimously agreed to grant General Pétain's government full power to formulate and promulgate a new constitution. The nature of this new regime will not be to express the will of the people expressed through deputies, but to express the interests of workers, professional circles, and intellectuals. From now on, France, as its leaders have said, will tend towards the form of a military organization. July is France's "historical month." The democratic system tends towards the revolution of July 1789, when the people of Paris rose up to demand national rights. The maxims of "liberty," "equality," and "fraternity" were born in that year. These maxims are now handed over to the Fascist Party and transformed into the phrases "work," "family," and "fatherland." He also said that with the collapse of the Third Republic, France must adopt the ideals of the conquerors, abandon democracy, and replace it with totalitarianism. This authoritarian regime, imitating the political organizations of Germany and Italy and living under the tutelage of Germany and Italy, will rise and fall with Fascism and Nazism. Historians will indicate that one week is the beginning of a new era in French political history and will prepare a blank page to record the next transformation, and if there is another transformation, it may be the Fourth French Republic.

This military strength will undoubtedly increase day by day, so it can eventually achieve victory with the assistance of the United Kingdom. De Gaulle advised his countrymen that their goal must be to defeat the enemy by doing their best, whether actively or passively. The French people, due to the incompetence of their leaders, have fallen into the hands of the German mechanized forces on the battlefield, but the world is not limited to this battlefield. Its ally, the United Kingdom, still controls the oceans and is gradually gaining air superiority, and its strength is increasing day by day. (Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

The motivation for the disbandment is to ensure that there are sufficient farmers in agriculture to carry out harvesting work, but the real reason is the intervention of Germany and Italy, so the tense situation between Hungary and Romania has obviously dissipated, and the demobilization of Hungary is also underway.

<p>Berlin: Yesterday, the German Foreign Ministry announced files 26 to 29 of the sixth volume of the White Paper, regarding the Allies' policy of expanding the war zone, which can prove that Britain and France had decided to prepare for war in Norway several months ago. On February 21, 1940, French Prime Minister Daladier sent a telegram to the French ambassador to Britain stating that, in view of the Finnish war, it was necessary to occupy several Norwegian seaports (file 26) to entice Sweden to participate in the Allies' direct intervention in Finland. Daladier stated that the British Navy's attack on the "Altmark" in Norwegian territorial waters was the starting point of this policy. The Allies considered Britain's actions justified. To avoid violating Norway's neutrality, Britain would monitor Norwegian territorial waters. If Norway protested, the British or Anglo-French Navy should quickly occupy Norway's most important seaports and bases. If Finland did not request assistance, the Allies would also have obtained a position to control northern Germany, so that Sweden's iron ore could not be transported to Germany. File 27 is the minutes of the 18th meeting of the committee for the study of the Northern European plan appointed by the Allied Military Issues Committee. The meeting was held on March 9 and discussed the landing plan for the attack on Narvik, that is, using one cruiser and several destroyers to attack and carrying a battalion of troops as the vanguard. The ports of Bergen and Stavanger should also be occupied, as Germany may occupy Stavanger's airfield. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry announced file 28 of the sixth volume of the White Paper yesterday, revealing the secret of the Anglo-French differences of opinion on the Norwegian war. The content is a telegram sent by French Prime Minister Reynaud to London on April 26, the full text of which is as follows: Urgent telegram, secret, sent from Paris at 8:30 PM on April 26, 1940.</p>
<p>To the French Ambassador to Britain, please immediately deliver Reynaud's urgent telegram to British Prime Minister Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Chamberlain, the National Defense Committee has now met on the Norwegian situation and has unanimously passed the following four resolutions:</p>
<p>(1) If Trondheim is abandoned, there will be serious consequences, both material and spiritual. We must not give it up. Not only will the Allies lose prestige, but the attitude of small and medium-sized neutral countries will also be adversely affected. In particular, Sweden's belief in the effectiveness of Allied assistance will be shaken. If so, Sweden will again sacrifice to Germany, and as a result, we will not be able to obtain Sweden's iron ore, and Narvik will also completely lose its value. In the end, France believes that Trondheim must not be abandoned.</p>
<p>(2) Although we do not consider the fall of Trondheim to be entirely impossible, the enemy can attack it from the sea and assist it with a large air force, and it will eventually be lost, but we believe that the current situation is still favorable and we can make an effort.</p>
<p>(3) I believe that you will agree that the command of the Scandinavian war must be concentrated in one person, but this person must only have the power to command the Norwegian-Swedish Allied forces. (4) We should greatly increase the troops, ammunition, tanks, and anti-aircraft guns being transported. If the current transportation is inconvenient, we should do our best to improve it. I believe that in this critical moment, you will agree with the above four items. In short, we should fight with all our strength and also seek rapid action, otherwise we will fail. I humbly report to you, and I hope you will consider it. Reynaud, signed. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>

The armored vehicle teams continued to search forward and did not stop. The next morning, the armored vehicle teams telegraphed that when searching for the radio code in the train, they discovered specially manufactured vehicles with all the shutters closed.

<p>Berlin: The most noteworthy point of the German economic situation in the week from the 8th to the 14th of this month is the progress in the quantity of necessities supplied to European countries. Germany plans to drain the flooded areas of the country in three weeks, which is truly a miracle. Rainfall was abundant in the first two weeks of this month, and farmers happily told each other that a bumper harvest was in sight. It is said that the harvest of rye, wheat, vegetables, and sweet potatoes can exceed the predicted quantity. (Haitong dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e48">Yunnan-Burma Transport Ban Does Not Harm China's War of Resistance, but Chinese Hope Britain Will Not Continue to Make Concessions: The Northwest International Route Cannot Be Blocked <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>After three years of war against Japan, the situation has reached a desolate and bleak state. Taking advantage of the precarious situation in Europe and France's defeat, Japan seeks to coerce Britain and France to threaten China, hoping to extricate itself from the quagmire. Having achieved unexpected success with the demand to ban transport through Vietnam, Japan has now demanded that Britain block the Yunnan-Burma transportation route. Britain initially refused, but under Japanese threats and intimidation, Tokyo has suddenly spread rumors that Britain is about to compromise. This news, when it reached Shanghai, caused general consternation among the Chinese regarding Britain's "gentlemanly spirit." Even if one were to put oneself in Britain's shoes and consider its predicament in Europe, making it unable to attend to matters in the East, there is absolutely no need to make such concessions to Japan. Japan is already preoccupied with its struggles in the war against China and is even more incapable of threatening Britain. Yesterday, several scholars in Shanghai concerned with current affairs held an interesting symposium focusing on the Yunnan-Burma issue. The issues discussed included: (1) What impact would British compromise with Japan have on Britain? (2) What consequences would arise if Britain refused Japan's demands? (3) What impact would the closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road have on China? The results are recorded below.</p>
<p>Insatiable Greed Knows No End</p>
<p>(1) It was generally agreed that if Britain compromises with Japan, it will only further fuel Japan's ambition. After this matter is settled, Japan will undoubtedly make new demands until it has encompassed all of Britain's interests in the Far East. Japan's current dealings with Britain and France are nothing more than speculative business practices by merchants, using empty threats. The more the other party softens, the more vigorous the attack. (2) It is predicted that Japanese newspapers will launch voluminous attacks on Britain, but this is just smoke and mirrors, and the result will be nothing more than that. (3) It will not have much impact on China. Over the past year, modern industry in various parts of the southwest has made rapid progress and is sufficient to be self-sufficient. Moreover, there is still the Northwest International Route available, which Japan cannot block. Resisting to the end is China's established national policy, and the war of resistance will not stop until victory is achieved.</p>
<p>Abundant Support Does Not Hinder the War of Resistance</p>
<p>At the time, a well-known expert on international issues gave an impromptu speech, pointing out that the recent attitude expressed by the European War and the United States and Britain was a crisis for the world's democratic countries. Any compromise with aggressors only weakens the power of democratic countries and demonstrates their lack of confidence. China's war of resistance, freedom, and liberation are its minimum goals. No matter how the international situation evolves, it will complete its great undertaking of resisting and building the nation. "Responding to all changes with constancy" has already been clearly stated by Chairman Chiang. Moreover, China's foreign policy is one of independence and autonomy. China is fighting for world justice, and those who act righteously need not worry about lack of support. Finally, it was said that the fact that the war of resistance has lasted for three years is ironclad proof of China's refusal to yield and is also one of the most glorious pages in the history of the world today. Adversity can only promote Chinese unity and struggle. The people of the country must redouble their efforts to fully accomplish this monumental undertaking.</p>

<p>Silk cocoons in the interior are under Japanese control. The number directly shipped abroad by the Japanese or purchased by Japanese factories and shipped to the Shanghai International Settlement is very small. Silk reeling factories in Shanghai have had to relocate to occupied areas in order to purchase raw materials nearby. According to Japanese announcements, the silk reeling factories in Shanghai that have moved to Wuxi include Chengxing, Sanyi, Hongfeng, Jianye, Dacheng, Hefeng, Yixing, and others. The factories that have moved to Hangzhou include Yucheng, Meifeng, and others.</p>

<p>The American President Lines' President Coolidge, under orders to assist in the evacuation of Americans from Hong Kong, delayed its originally scheduled arrival in Shanghai on the 11th. According to the company's reporter at the New China News Agency, the ship is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Manila and Hong Kong at 7:00 a.m. this morning, berthing at buoy numbers 11 and 12. The Jianghai Customs passenger launch left the dock at 7:00 a.m. this morning and is expected to return at 9:00 a.m. Due to the delay in Hong Kong, the ship will only berth in Shanghai until 11:30 p.m. tonight, when it will set sail for the United States via Kobe, Los Angeles, Honolulu, and San Francisco. The customs passenger launch is scheduled to leave the dock at 10:00 p.m. tonight. In addition to carrying mail, the Coolidge brought a large number of American women and children who were ordered to evacuate. They will reside in Shanghai temporarily until further instructions are given.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Price Stabilization Will Be Held Tomorrow; Flour Shortage in the Market Causes Noodles to Rise in Price Again <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The Price Stabilization Committee issued a notice yesterday stating, "It is hereby announced that the fourth phase of price stabilization will be held starting at 7:00 a.m. on July 16th, still entrusted to the rice shops that are members of the Rice Industry Association, totaling 60 shops. There are 36 shops in the International Settlement, 18 of which sell tickets and 18 of which distribute rice, and 24 shops in the French Concession, 11 of which sell tickets and 12 of which distribute rice. The methods are as follows: (1) 4 catties of rice can be purchased for one yuan of Shanghai legal tender; (2) Each person is limited to one yuan's worth of rice; (3) Each shop sells 50 bags of rice until sold out; (4) Price stabilization time is from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. daily. In addition to requesting assistance from the police authorities of the two concessions, this is hereby announced."</p>
<p>(Flour Shortage in the Market) The Continental Daily News reports that according to reliable sources, the authorities of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement are currently engaged in consultations to resolve the flour shortage in the city, and a satisfactory result is expected. Moreover, a large batch of Australian and American flour is on its way to Shanghai, so it is expected that the price of flour in Shanghai will fall instantly. The Municipal Council has already consulted with major Chinese flour merchants to sell existing flour at a price of 15.5 yuan per bag (49 pounds). Once negotiations to increase the import of domestic flour are completed, the selling price of flour will reach a normal level, or even lower than 15.5 yuan.</p>
<p>(Consultations on Stabilizing Prices) Shanghai's daily flour demand is 5,000 bags, but only a portion of that is transported in through the obstacles surrounding the city, so Shanghai is experiencing a flour shortage. Lowering flour prices is the second step taken by the new subcommittee of the Municipal Council's Price Stabilization Committee. The first step was a meeting on Tuesday between 16 leaders of the rice industry in the city and the administrative authorities of the two concessions to stabilize rice prices in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Lack of Supply) The Shanghai Machine-Made Noodle Industry Association said that since the Fuxin Flour Mill in Shanghai stopped production, the source of flour has decreased, and at the same time, the cost of raw materials has increased. Therefore, it convened a meeting of all members of the flour industry the other day to discuss maintenance methods. It was generally agreed that this time, the authorities' relief of selling flour at a stable price could be adjusted. However, since the Fuxin factory stopped production, the source of flour has decreased. The average member of the 300-plus members only receives one bag of flour. As for miscellaneous brand flours, the cost is very high, and it is difficult to maintain business. A resolution was passed:</p>
<p>(Temporary Price Increase) (1) In order to compensate for losses, the price of sliced noodles will be increased by 3 cents from the original price; (2) From the 15th of this month, the retail price of sliced noodles will be 35 cents per catty, and no excess is allowed; (3) The authorities are requested to urge the Fuxin factory to start production as soon as possible, and the Fufeng factory's flour will no longer be discounted, in order to maintain the people's livelihood; (4) The increase in the price of sliced noodles will be reported to the French Municipal Council and the Price Stabilization Committee of the International Settlement for record.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Wartime Donations Have Reached Enormous Sums <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Since the British Community War Savings Association started its work, British expatriates have donated enthusiastically. With the assistance of the British Association and other organizations, progress has been smooth. According to the association's announcement, as of the 11th of this month, it has received 984,719.77 yuan in national currency and £17,260, 2 shillings, and 7 pence in British gold. It also intends to issue £750 in British gold to the British Community Women's Association in Shanghai to purchase wool fabrics for the production of wartime comfort items and other necessities. The British Community Central Donation Association has been working very hard recently. Although the past two days were regular weekend holidays, it still worked as usual, and British expatriates continued to come to donate in large numbers.</p>
<p>(French Community Donations) Since France made peace with Germany, the French community in Shanghai, due to their strong patriotism, has continued to donate to aid the relief efforts in their home country. The French Wounded Soldiers Relief Association has raised a total of 328,301.36 yuan in Chinese currency, £92 in British gold, and 434,943.14 francs in French gold in seven fundraising campaigns, which is a very satisfactory result. It is heard that the funds will be handed over to the French Banque de l'Indochine for remittance to relieve wounded and fallen officers and soldiers.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Chinese Industrial Cooperatives Movement Has Achieved Great Success; Refugees Have Become a Powerful Force for Production; the Cost of Making a Hand Grenade Is Only Slightly More Than 50 Cents <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>American writer Asa Barber wrote an article in the latest issue of "Reader's Digest" praising the success of the industrial cooperatives movement in China's war of resistance, and pointing to it as a sign of the glorious future of the Far East. The article states that China's rebirth is entirely due to its own efforts, and the most remarkable achievement is the flourishing industrial cooperatives movement.</p>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Promotes the Movement</p>
<p>Two years ago, the Englishman Rewi Alley and the American journalist Edgar Snow advocated this movement in China. Subsequently, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr strongly urged Madame Chiang Kai-shek to launch an industrial cooperative movement to relieve refugees, which was finally approved by the National Government, which appointed Alley to preside over the matter. Many Chinese engineers who had studied in the United States assisted in this effort.</p>
<p>The First Unit Was Established in Baoji</p>
<p>On August 26, 1938, the first unit of the industrial cooperative was established. Many refugee ironworkers established an iron factory in Baoji, Shaanxi. On October 31 of the following year, an air raid destroyed the factory, but the brave Chinese workers persevered. After four months of effort, more than 70 industrial cooperatives were established in southwestern Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Establishment of Schools to Train Cadres</p>
<p>The government subsidized a total of 440,000 yuan, half of which was lent to the 1,800 members of the cooperative for the purpose of developing the manufacture of various necessities. A school was also established in Baoji to train cadres. After half a year, the number of cooperatives increased to 182, with 2,475 workers.</p>
<p>Production Value Reached Five Million</p>
<p>According to statistics, as of October 1939, the total production value of 1,470 cooperatives across the country was 5 million yuan, with an investment of only 3,630,000 yuan. As a result, refugees have become a powerful force for production. According to Mrs. Snow's investigation, the cost of 10 million yuan is enough to build a super battleship. If that amount is lent to China, it would be enough to establish 480,000 cooperatives, saving 8 million refugees.</p>
<p>The Cost of Manufacturing Weapons Is Extremely Low</p>
<p>If the American naval leaders want to emphasize the inevitability of fighting Japan, the American authorities would be better off lending money to China, which is both practical and a great contribution to humanity. The aforementioned cooperatives can also manufacture large quantities of machine guns, pistols, rifles, and automatic rifles. The cost of manufacturing a hand grenade is only 52 cents. These weapons are supplied to the Chinese guerrillas to attack the rear and transportation lines of the Japanese.</p>
<p>It Is Absolutely Difficult for the Japanese to Destroy Them</p>
<p>Mobile industrial cooperative units are also active behind the lines of the Japanese army in Anhui and Shanxi. As it stands now, China's industry is distributed inland, and Japanese aircraft are absolutely unable to destroy it. Therefore, the brave Chinese workers are building a brighter future in the Far East.</p>

<p>The Taikoo Company's Shengjing ship, which was carrying 794 boxes of French defense army ammunition for Tianjin, arrived in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 9th. It was intercepted by the Japanese Navy in the Huangpu River and forced to sail to the Zhanghuabang river surface to berth, where it was monitored by four small Japanese warships. The next day, all the ammunition was seized by the Japanese and unloaded ashore at that location. It is heard that an agreement has been reached between the French and Japanese sides on this matter, but the British and Japanese are still negotiating and have not completely resolved it. The Shengjing ship was released to Shanghai at 7:45 p.m. on the 12th. It was originally scheduled to sail to North China on the 13th, but due to insufficient time to load and unload cargo and due to the hurricane, it was postponed until 10:00 a.m. yesterday before it set sail and left Shanghai. It is heard that Major Bowen, the Superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, was on board the ship to Weihaiwei for summer vacation.</p>

<p>In recent British newspapers, there is often talk of the Fifth Column. It is said that this strange name has a Russian origin. In the era of the Russian Tsarist government, someone asked a Russian general: What is the organization of the Russian army like? The general told him that there were four columns—infantry, cavalry, artillery, and engineers. Finally, he added a column, which was the secret police.</p>
<p>Not long ago, this name reappeared in the Spanish War and immediately became "news." It is said that when Franco marched to attack the loyal government forces holding Madrid, the capital of Spain, he declared that he had opened four columns, and his fifth column was active in the city for him. This is the first time that the term Fifth Column, which contains the recently popular meaning, has met us.</p>
<p>Since the Norwegian capital Oslo was sold by spies, many people have written to newspapers demanding the eradication of spies within Britain—that is, the Fifth Column in Britain. These timely warnings were published by various newspapers in conspicuous places, thus causing a temporary sensation in London. Some people even advocated that all foreigners in Britain should be monitored, even those who are innocent, sympathetic to Britain, and should sacrifice their freedom of movement for the sake of public safety. But many other people said in unison in their letters that those who are highly suspicious and should get out of Britain to their beloved country are not foreign expatriates, nor the Germans who were expelled by Hitler and are escaping abroad, but those British-born fascists who are disloyal to Britain.</p>
<p>In all fairness, Britain is a democratic country; freedom of speech for the people is a golden rule in Britain. Even now, after more than half a year of fighting, there are still people advocating anti-war. Some people think that those who oppose war with Germany are hindering the work of the government and should be punished for treason, and the Fifth Column that instigated them behind them should be punished even more.</p>
<p>At a time when all of Britain is thinking about finding the real Fifth Column, a very famous and successful female writer, Miss Manlin, wrote to the newspaper saying that she herself is a member of the Fifth Column. Her letter said:</p>
<p>"Since we are still a democratic country, since the free expression of will is an important spirit of democracy, then can you allow me, a member of the so-called 'Fifth Column,' to present two opposing opinions to your correspondents?</p>
<p>"People like us firmly believe that war cannot solve problems, it has not in the past, and it will not in the future. If everyone regards us as internal traitors, regards us as enemy spies, etc., then what about freedom of speech? Is it possible to sacrifice the greatest virtue of democracy for the sake of indignation at fascism?"</p>
<p>"Since we are still a democratic country, then the opposition party should also have room to express its opinions. To abolish this point is the beginning of fascism."</p>
<p>"The second point is that we are a small number of people (if there were more, there would be no war). Are we worth such scolding, worth such waste of paper?"</p>
<p>Her letter is very touching! Just imagine, a female writer actually publicly admits that she is a member of the Fifth Column! I personally happen to know this Miss Manlin, and I dare to guarantee that she is definitely not a spy. She is a pacifist and has a very strong democratic spirit. But her letter aroused countless reactions. Among them, I think two people's letters are worth citing. One is my friend, the playwright Mr. Noblock. His most famous works, which we Chinese know, are the two films "The Three Musketeers" and "The Moon Palace Treasure Box" starring Lao Fan Pengke. He said that everyone can have opinions and can express opinions, but there are some times when a person's responsibility to the country is more important than his own responsibility; we must know that sometimes our own opinions, which we think are very important, may affect the victory of the war of resistance once expressed, in other words, may hinder the final peace. He said that when we are sober, who doesn't hate war. But now who doesn't know that war has already come, and our responsibility is to go to the front line. He feels that if you want to stop the war forever, you can only strive for this purpose in a peaceful and prosperous age. Once the war has broken out, it is unwise and disloyal to the country to say struggle for peace from it, it is to disperse your own strength!</p>
<p>The second insightful letter was written by Mr. Gadifu Stone. He said,</p>
<p>"Miss Manlin said in her rather candid letter that she and her comrades are only a minority (she said if there were more, there would be no war!). She is right. Because if we (including Miss Manlin) were reduced to the same situation as those Poles, Austrians, Czechs, and Danes who are worse than war, perhaps there would be no war."</p>
<p>Everyone knows that there is an ancient Chinese saying: "Brothers quarrel in the home, but resist insults from outside." This sentence should be applied to today's situation.</p>

<p>At 8:30 a.m. yesterday morning, at the open space of the French Consulate General at No. 2 Gongguan Road, Consul General Aorain presided over a flag-raising ceremony. French Ambassador Gossomar and his wife, French Defense Army Commander Colonel Essu, and several other important French officials attended. Amidst the sound of military music, the solemn and solemn commemorative ceremony was completed. All public institutions in the French Concession, such as the French Police Station and the Fire Brigade, and the two French warships Ganel and Leclair anchored in the Huangpu River, all hung the tricolor French flag to show their celebration. Near noon at 11:30 a.m., the French Ambassador also hosted French officials and French community leaders in the consulate. The French Embassy, Consulate, Public Works Bureau, Police Department, and other agencies all followed the example and took a day off yesterday because it was Sunday, and they will take a day off today. As for the French community, there were no joyous programs as in the past, only banquets were held separately to commemorate the difficulties of the pioneers.

<p>The second fundraising meeting of the Shaoxing and Xiaoshan Disaster Relief Association was held at 4:00 p.m. yesterday at the Shaoxing Fellow Townsmen Association's hall on Aierjin Road. More than 150 fellow townsmen attended, and Mi Chengxun, Wu Xingzai, and Mi Ziyu were publicly elected as the presidium. Those who recognized and solicited donations on the spot were very enthusiastic. First, Chairman Wu Xingzai gave an opening speech, saying that fellow townsmen have been enthusiastically donating, and the total amount is already close to 400,000 yuan. He hoped that fellow townsmen would continue to work hard. Next, Zhong Zhiqian reported on the association's affairs, saying that 120,000 yuan had been withdrawn from the donated funds and handled by the Shaoxing Disaster Area Relief Association to provide porridge. As for the rampant epidemics in Shaoxing, the first batch of epidemic prevention medicines had been transported to Shaoxing a few days ago, and the second batch was still being solicited. He hoped that fellow townsmen would continue to donate. He also announced the</p>
<p>Express Mail Telegram sent by the township heads of various townships in Xiaoshan County (note that these townships have not fallen), (title omitted) The price of rice and grain has been extremely high recently, and there is widespread mourning in Xiaoshan. The government's allocation of funds for porridge is very small, and it is a drop in the bucket, which is difficult to help generally. For this reason, we telegraph to you, and we urge you to care about your hometown and solicit donations separately, and telegraph huge sums of money as soon as possible to save the disaster-stricken people. We are grateful and hope. Township heads Tu Jifang and others of Dongyue District, Ningdong, and other townships in Xiaoshan County respectfully salute. The conference then recommended fundraising committee members and asked each fundraising committee member who had not yet recognized the amount to fill in the amount on the spot, and also asked those who had already recognized to step up fundraising and deposit it with the bank designated by the association, or to increase the amount recognized. The meeting was adjourned at around 5:00 p.m. Also, according to a certain gentleman from the association,</p>
<p>The disaster situation in Shaoxing is several times more tragic than in Ningbo, but after the efforts of the Shanghai fellow townsmen to donate, the serious situation of the Ningbo disaster has been alleviated. Since the Shaoxing fellow townsmen were called upon by the Shanghai fellow townsmen, donations have been enthusiastic, but still far from the goal, and there are no less than 100,000 Shaoxing fellow townsmen in Shanghai, and there is also considerable authority in the silver and money industry. If everyone can do their best and work hard to solicit donations, then their achievements will not be less than those of the Ningbo Shanghai fellow townsmen. If the disaster situation in their hometown can be solved easily, and the lives of their fellow townsmen can be restored, then our Shanghai fellow townsmen can also be pleased in spirit. Shaoxing</p>

<p>The Ministry of Finance of the National Government recently issued an order to all provincial finance departments to reiterate the strict prohibition of using Japanese military certificates and counterfeit money, stating, "According to reports, the Japanese side has recently been using a large number of military certificates and counterfeit money, and has set up many exchange offices in the occupied areas to collect legal currency, and then use these Japanese military certificates and counterfeit money to exchange for materials in the interior. As a result, the number of Japanese and puppet banknotes in the interior is increasing, and the outflow of materials is increasing. Without spending a single cent, the Japanese can obtain all kinds of materials from our country, and damage the credit of our legal currency. The banknotes issued by the Japanese puppets and the military certificates issued by the Japanese side, regardless of where they are, must not be accepted or used. The Ministry has clearly stipulated this in the measures for cracking down on Japanese puppet banknotes. Regarding the sale of goods to Japan, the National Government has also promulgated regulations prohibiting the transportation of goods to Japan. Therefore, we reiterate the prohibition and earnestly inform the people that they must not accept or use Japanese puppet banknotes and military certificates, and must not sell materials to the Japanese. Violators should be severely punished according to law, so as to serve as a warning."</p>

<p>Yuanheng Zhuang on Henan Road sent a tea boy, Yin Yongxiang, to Huafeng Remittance Shop in the Guohua Bank Building at around 10 am on May 7 this year to collect 5,500 yuan in checks. The remittance shop immediately paid the amount. However, Yin Yongxiang had just put 1,000 yuan into his bag when the remaining amount was robbed. Yuanheng Zhuang recently commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court's Civil Division, requesting the court to order Huafeng Remittance Shop to pay 4,500 yuan in national currency. The reason is that only 1,000 yuan was received from the 5,500 yuan check. Whether the remaining 4,500 yuan was sufficient or genuine had not been counted on the tea boy's counter in Huafeng Remittance Shop when several robbers broke in and robbed the money. Therefore, it cannot be considered to have been received. The case was heard by Judge Tao in Civil Court No. 1 the other day. Lawyer E Sen appeared in court on behalf of the defendant, Huafeng Remittance Shop, stating that the payment had already been made. Although it was robbed, the defendant cannot pay the amount a second time and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected. The lawyers for both parties debated for a long time.

<p>The second company unit table tennis league hosted by the Shanghai Insurance Industry Amateur Association held the finals at the Shanghai Lianda Ballroom the day before yesterday (the 13th) to determine the championship. More than 300 guests and players arrived. The competition committee members Zhu Maoyi and Zhao Weimin reported on the significance and process of the professional competition, and Mr. Chen Linsheng was invited to serve as the referee. North America B against Allied Powers. North America B is a new force, with twelve wins in twelve games. Allied Powers is the defending champion and has many famous players.

<h3 id="e84">Shanghai Financial Dynamics Over the Past Six Months <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xielin</p>
<p>During the past six months, the Shanghai financial market has been subject to frequent changes. Idle funds have become more abundant, and speculation has been more vigorous. By mid-May, the overall situation changed dramatically, and the New York stock market also experienced a sharp decline. Consequently, the Shanghai financial market also underwent changes, with foreign exchange rates rebounding, and stocks and yarn experiencing sharp drops, resulting in significant losses for speculators. The following is an analysis of the financial dynamics over the past six months for readers' reference.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, the unofficial exchange rate has trended towards ease and strength. Since the market opened on January 4th, it briefly reached five pence and eight US dollars, but with fluctuations, it remained in a speculative state. Due to rumors of peace, the promulgation of the British financial restriction law, and news of the Japanese cabinet's collapse, people were uncertain and adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Later, as the European situation deteriorated, funds from Hong Kong fled to Shanghai, increasing spot positions and easing the exchange rate. At the end of January, the atmosphere of peace dissipated, coupled with substantial payments from Japanese yarn factories, leading to a slight tightening of the foreign exchange market. However, with frequent sales from Hong Kong telegraphs, the exchange rate gradually stabilized. In early February, the financial situation was strained during the year-end settlement period for 1939. Chinese banks, exporters, and speculators engaged in selling, but foreign banks showed strong appetite. Japanese banks, Sassoon, and Tianjin merchants were actively purchasing, and cotton importers were also active, leading to a continued tightening of the exchange rate. Soon after the market reopened, the wind of speculative manipulation had entered a frenzied state; cash surged first, and foreign exchange tightened later. At the same time, importers of rice, wheat, and cotton made large-scale purchases, and although there were long positions offering to sell, the downward trend of the exchange market was difficult to reverse. By the end of the month, the pound sterling had shrunk to four pence one two five; the stabilization fund intervened to maintain the exchange rate, which then stabilized. The supply from the fund was estimated to be between 500,000 and 750,000 pounds. Subsequently, with the establishment of the new Sino-US loan, the exchange market stabilized. In early March, the pound sterling continued to fall in the New York market, from 3.99225 on the 4th to 3.72 on the 21st. On March 25th, the UK strengthened foreign exchange controls, stipulating that special commodities shipped to specific countries must be paid for in designated foreign currencies or pound sterling obtained at the official exchange rate set by the British government. The pound price fell further, reaching 3.52 and five-eighths on March 29th. The Shanghai US dollar exchange rate followed suit, shrinking from 6.71875 to 6.03125. The pound sterling experienced no fluctuations. Most long positions turned to US dollar and futures activities, leading to a tightening of the spot market and a widening of forward spreads. Banks with strong capital were engaged in arbitrage. Domestic banks supplied importers and speculators with tight forward US dollars, and purchased spot pound sterling at four pence one two five, and then sold pound sterling in the New York market, locking in US dollars. Such arbitrage was quite profitable. Trading in pound sterling in the free market had become very narrow, and arbitrage from East Asia often disrupted the balance of the pound-dollar exchange rate. Therefore, the Shanghai exchange market in March was almost entirely dominated by the British-American exchange rate. For the sake of stabilizing the market, the stabilization fund pegged the pound sterling at four pence one two five and allowed the US dollar to fluctuate naturally. This was convenient for speculators to maintain their positions, and at the same time, the British-American exchange rate was relatively stable, so the US dollar exchange rate did not change much. Moreover, at the end of April, credit tightened and the exchange rate stabilized.</p>
<p>After the end of April, the unofficial exchange rate suddenly changed, and the HSBC exchange rate also shrank sharply. On May 2nd, the pound sterling exchange rate was changed to three pence two five, and the US dollar exchange rate was four yuan six eight seven five. The pound sterling exchange rate reached its lowest price since August 11th last year, and the US dollar exchange rate broke the record of five yuan and a half on September 19th last year. The market situation was chaotic, and buying interest rose sharply. On the afternoon of the 3rd, HSBC posted an unprecedentedly low price: three pence for the pound sterling and four yuan three one two five for the US dollar, and the market price also shrank sharply. On the 4th, the pound sterling exchange rate was only three pence, and the US dollar exchange rate was four yuan and a half. The stabilization fund had maintained the unofficial exchange rate at four pence one two five for more than two months. Why was it suddenly abandoned? It was because of the difficulties encountered in the exchange market. After the outbreak of the European war, the transportation of goods to China and the export of goods from various countries did not make progress. Therefore, in the first quarter of this year, the national trade deficit reached 1.7 million pounds, which inevitably had a significant impact on the international balance of payments. This is one of the reasons. Idle funds gathered in Shanghai, and competition for speculative manipulation was the goal. Analyzing the operating reports of various financial industries, current deposits accounted for more than 70% of total deposits. These current deposits were all waiting for opportunities to move and use, so current deposits increased and speculation was rampant, which put more pressure on the exchange market. This is the second reason. Lowering the exchange rate was to adjust foreign trade and to strike a blow at speculators.</p>
<p>Since the expansion of the European war, German troops invaded the Netherlands and Belgium, and the Dutch and Belgian banks in Shanghai were affected. In order to cope with withdrawals, they had to dispose of all their foreign exchange. At the same time, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia repatriated large sums of money to China to prevent possible dangers and strict exchange controls, so the Shanghai exchange market was strong. As a result, although the British-American exchange rate changed on May 11, falling to around three yuan, the Shanghai exchange market continued to lengthen both British and American exchanges, which was beyond the expectations of general speculators. After mid-May, rumors abounded, mostly biased towards the European situation, causing short sellers to disappear and long positions to continue to be thrown away; foreign banks' appetites were also relatively weak; as a result, the exchange market was smooth and gradually eased; on May 14, the US dollar exchange rate reached five yuan, and on the 17th, the British exchange rate reached four shillings. On June 11, due to the sharp increase in the pound price in New York to 3.8 yuan, and news of Italy's participation in the war, the exchange market became even more bullish, the British exchange rate stabilized, and the US dollar exchange rate rose sharply, reaching six yuan on that day.</p>
<p>Since the unofficial exchange rate has changed repeatedly, speculative manipulation has become more sophisticated. Chinese and foreign banks, in view of this, have adopted cooperative measures. Since the 30th of the month, they have uniformly refused foreign exchange swaps, causing speculators to suffer. Because most speculators operate in foreign exchange futures; ordinary futures are for one, two, and three months; if the contract expires, they can ask the bank to discount and transfer the period to the next month for delivery; in the hope that the exchange rate can obtain a surplus at that time. Now that the banks have stopped swapping, speculators will be in a difficult situation; this should also help to suppress speculation.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of margin gold and the bond market are determined by the exchange rate, so I will omit them here. During these six months, the bond market has been stable, without major changes. At the beginning of the year, the market opened vigorously, because of the intense Japanese cabinet tide and the spread of a peaceful atmosphere, speculators were active, and investors also rose to participate, and the market has always stood at the peak. By January 30, the Unified A reached 63.65 yuan, Unified B 54.30 yuan, Unified C 51.70 yuan, Unified West 50.65 yuan, Unified E 51.35 yuan, this price is indeed rare after the war. On February 12, when the red plate was opened, it coincided with the sharp contraction of foreign exchange and the surge in margin gold, and because government bonds were not used as collateral, the spot was sold off, and the bond market was depressed. During the month of April, the bond market added weight in many ways due to favorable conditions. General speculators also abandoned cash and yarn and engaged in activities in the bond market, resulting in demand exceeding supply, and prices rose, and the Unified A rushed out of 60 yuan for the second time. By the end of April, credit was too tight, and because foreign stocks were rising and foreign exchange interest arbitrage reached more than 5%, speculators abandoned this and went to that, and the price fell. After mid-May, foreign exchange was loose, cash fell, and foreign stocks fell sharply, and the bond market rebounded, rising about one yuan on the 14th. People were optimistic, and government bonds were replenished, and new long positions rose, and the Unified A reached 60 yuan, and Unified C and E also reached 50 yuan. Later, because the interest rate was too high, people were satisfied, and the bond market became a spiral. On June 4, due to good news, people were inspired, and the price rose sharply due to the addition of weight on many sides and the replenishment of short positions. By the 5th, the Unified A had reached 61 yuan and 40 cents. By the end of June, the foreign exchange rate had eased, and the news was still favorable to the long positions, so the market price still tended to be firm.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Chinese people rarely ask about the foreign stock market, but since the European War, idle funds in Shanghai have become more abundant. According to estimates in the financial sector, idle funds reached 300 million yuan at the end of last year. How can a corner of Shanghai accommodate so much idle funds, so they all tend to speculate. Last year, speculation was limited to foreign exchange margin gold. This year, idle funds have increased, and the scope of speculation has also expanded. Foreign stocks have also been selected as one of the speculative targets. After the market opened at the beginning of the year, the market price soared. By the beginning of May, the market prices of various stocks were more than five times higher than the par value. For example, the market price on the 2nd, Jardine Matheson rose to 78 yuan, and Connaught Road reached more than 200 yuan, and the British Union also rose to 70 yuan. But in less than a week, the market price of Connaught Road had fallen to 112 yuan. Other stocks also fell sharply. Moreover, because the New York stock market fell sharply, foreign stock market prices could not be sustained, and selling was rampant, and buyers did not dare to look up. As a result, ordinary retail investors and blind speculators suffered heavy losses, and there were frequent reports of bankruptcies. In late May, the price of Connaught Road was only 41 yuan. In two weeks, the price difference was several times as high. It is indeed rare. After this great change in the stock market, the desire to recover is probably hopeless. Speculators can wake up!</p>
<p>Banking and Money Industry</p>
<p>Since the Supreme National Defense Committee approved the "Outline of Measures for Sound Central Financial Institutions in Wartime" on September 8, 1939, the United Office of the Four Banks was reorganized and established accordingly. A discount and loan office was established to take charge of the joint discount and loan matters of the four banks. The Shanghai Discount and Loan Association was also reorganized into the Shanghai Branch of the United Office of the Four Banks in January in accordance with the methods formulated by the General Office of the Four Banks. A committee system was adopted, and one person was publicly elected from the committee as the director. Three groups were set up under the director: business, document, and accounting. All the loans pledged by the Discount and Loan Committee in the past were taken over by the Shanghai Branch. As of January, the outstanding loan balance of the office was 17.75 million yuan, 17.3 million yuan in February, 16.8 million yuan in March, and 17.2 million yuan in April.</p>
<p>The banks newly established in Shanghai this year are the Guangdong Bank and the Guohua Bank, which opened branches on Avenue Joffre.</p>
<p>On June 18, the Shanghai branch of the Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank announced its closure. According to the bank's head office, it was established in March 1935 with a capital of 1 million yuan. The head office was located in Nanjing and moved to Chongqing after the war. The Shanghai branch was established in June last year and closed due to poor turnover.</p>
<p>New Remittance Drawing</p>
<p>Here is the ninth inspection report. As of the end of March this year, the total value of collateral deposited by various banks and companies for inter-bank remittance drawing was 55,554,620 yuan, 8 jiao and 3 fen, including (1) goods 2 million yuan, (2) marketable securities 11 million yuan, and (3) real estate 42 million yuan. At the same time, the total amount of remittance drawing approved by the preparation committee was 24,560,000 yuan, including (1) the amount already drawn by various banks and companies 22 million yuan, and (2) the amount not yet drawn by various banks and companies 12.5 million yuan. Judging from the content of the collateral, real estate is the main part. Using the property invested and stagnated by various banks and companies, it has become a liquid remittance drawing. In the current Shanghai, when idle funds are abundant and inflation is rampant, it seems inappropriate.</p>
<p>Interest Rate</p>
<p>Opened by the Shanghai Branch of the United Office of the Four Banks</p>
<p>The discount rate opened by the Shanghai Branch of the United Office of the Four Banks is 7.5%, and the loan interest is 2 jiao and 5 fen of the discount interest. The national currency for the discount interest is 2 jiao and 8 fen, and it has not changed so far. Remittance drawing reached its lowest point of 1 jiao and 8 fen in late January; it rose to a peak of 3 jiao and 3 fen on May 1 and then stabilized. Inter-bank remittance drawing reached its lowest point of 1 jiao and 5 fen in January and February; it stabilized at 3 jiao after rising to 3 jiao on May 1. The money industry's interest rate reached its lowest point of 1 jiao on January 27; it reached its highest point of 2 jiao and 5 fen on May 1. This was to curb speculation, and the effect was self-evident. It is better to actively stop supplying speculators.</p>
<p>Check Exchange</p>
<p>This year, the market is prosperous and speculation is flourishing, and the amount of check exchange has increased sharply. It was 835 million yuan in January, 886 million yuan in February, 1,003.7 million yuan in March, and 1,297 million yuan in April. It was 1,003.4 million yuan in May, and 367 million yuan in the first half of June. The content is mostly national currency, and the remittance drawing part accounts for a small part. It can be seen that idle funds are expanding. The reduction in remittance drawing circulation seems to be the failure of the capital blockade policy.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the collection and settlement of checks, since July 4, 1939, more than 40 money industry reserve banks and remittance drawing companies have joined the bank's check exchange through entrusted agency exchange. Since its implementation, it has been quite convenient. Therefore, check exchange has been concentrated, which is a major improvement in the check clearing of the banking and money industry. However, since May 13 this year, the money industry withdrew from the exchange and restored the old method. All the money industry checks received by various banks are still collected by the Bank United Reserve Committee, and then the committee and the Money Industry Reserve Bank summarize the accounts. It's really inexplicable!</p>
<p>This year, Nanjing Bank and Dunxu Bank joined the check exchange, and they were allowed to participate in the form of agency exchange. According to the original 10 agency exchange banks, now there are two more participants, making a total of 12.</p>
<p>In order to facilitate check clearing, the Italian Commercial Chinese Bank decided to join the Chinese Commercial Bank Check Exchange and entrusted the Zhejiang Industrial Bank to exchange checks on its behalf. On June 24, it began to join the agency exchange, opening the first precedent for foreign commercial banks to join the Chinese Commercial Bank Check Exchange.</p>
<p>Remittance Drawing Discount</p>
<p>When remittance drawing was first implemented, the remittance drawing discount was only one or two yuan. Later, when capital flight and foreign exchange speculation and arbitrage were booming, everyone exchanged remittance drawings for cash, because remittance drawings could not be used to purchase foreign exchange. Therefore, remittance drawing discounts continued to rise, reaching more than 250 yuan per thousand in July and August last year. Since the European War, capital flight has returned, and credit has eased, and remittance drawing discounts have also fallen. On January 22, it was only 24 yuan. As soon as the red plate opened, speculation was in full swing, and it rose accordingly; on February 28, it reached 15 yuan. On April 22, it had reached 115 yuan; after the end of April, foreign exchange plummeted, and the market was panicked, just like the situation in July and August last year; on May 4, it reached 230 yuan, which can be said to be the highest price in the first half of this year. In May, it always hovered above 100 yuan, and it was not until June 11 that it entered the 100 yuan mark; after that, it was around 70 or 80 yuan. The existence of remittance drawing discounts has completely invalidated the capital blockade policy. Therefore, the banking and money authorities should find ways to suppress it.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial dynamics in the past six months have been as described above. The reason why Shanghai's finance has become such a situation is because funds from all over the country have gathered in Shanghai. At the end of last year, idle funds were estimated to be 300 million yuan, and by the Dragon Boat Festival it had reached 500 million yuan. In today's international situation, which continues to be tense, even more funds must flow to Shanghai. Idle funds are abundant, and there is no proper management of funds, so speculation in domestic goods is doing whatever it wants, and prices rise sharply and fall sharply for a time, causing the market to be disturbed. The losses of speculators are minor, and the damage to the national economy is significant. In the future, funds should be given proper management so that they can be invested in useful ways, and the financial pathology can also be improved.</p>

<p>According to the US calculation for the UK, the Shanghai US exchange rate should be 5.85833 yuan, which is only 0.10833 different from the HSBC US exchange rate. The listed price is based on the bank's selling price, which is usually 1/16 to 1/8 lower than the fair price as the bank's handling fee and profit. However, the HSBC listing is only a market price standard, and the actual market price is still different from the listing price. Even HSBC itself does not calculate according to the listed price for foreign trade.</p>
<p>(3) In normal times, there are also slight differences between the UK to the US and the US to the UK, but the number is very small, at most a few li and a few hao. However, since the UK controlled foreign exchange, it cannot freely purchase US exchange with pounds in London. The official exchange rate of 4 yuan and 3 and a half cents for the UK to the US cannot represent the actual market price. In New York, the pound and the US dollar can be freely exchanged, so it is called the free pound. Although the free pound has fallen to 3 yuan and 1 jiao, the official price in London can still maintain 4 yuan and 2 and a half cents because US exchange cannot be freely exchanged for pounds in London.</p>
<p>(4) The commercial news in Shen Bao about the foreign exchange market conditions is the actual market price; the market price table is the HSBC listed market price, and the actual and listed market prices are of course different. The reason is in the answer to the third question.</p>
<p>Mr. Liao Yuanfu asked:</p>
<p>The newspaper on June 20 published "The following is the ex-factory price of US cotton futures converted to US exchange at 5.8125 yuan: 20 counts of American millet at 300.50." Because the current spot price of US cotton on that day is converted to 189.80 at 10.1, the difference with 300.50 is so huge that it is not clear. How much is the intermediate cost?</p>
<p>The converted price of 300.50 is the Sima weight price. The 189.80 you mentioned is the market weight price. It should be divided by the market weight to Sima weight ratio of 827 to get the Sima weight of 229.50. According to the pre-war situation, the cost is: the cost of US cotton land and water transportation and water insurance to Shanghai is at least 2 yuan and 5 jiao in US dollars per market dan. Then 2 yuan and 5 jiao is about 3 yuan and 1 jiao. Calculated at 17 yuan and 2 jiao of legal currency for each US dollar, it is 53 yuan, 3 jiao and 2 fen. The customs duty paid for US cotton to Shanghai is about 9 yuan, 6 jiao and 8 fen per Sima dan, war risk insurance is 1 yuan, 7 jiao and 8 fen, miscellaneous fees are 8 jiao, and the car force and weight loss to the factory are about 2 yuan. , and the remaining profit is 3 yuan and 4 jiao and 2 fen, totaling 300.50. If the freight is reduced, the profit will be even greater.</p>
<p>Mr. Fang Zheng's six questions, here are brief answers as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The so-called foreign exchange is the abbreviation of foreign exchange or international exchange, that is, the conversion of national currency into foreign currency. The exchange rate reported is the price of its conversion. In principle, the conversion of legal currency into foreign currency should be calculated according to the legal price listed by the Central Bank. The price listed by HSBC is also one of the black market exchange rates.</p>
<p>(2) The so-called black exchange market, etc., is the translated name of the English Black Market, referring to the illegal market. See the brief answer to Mr. Li Guangzhou's first question above.</p>
<p>(3) The Central Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee was established in mid-March 1939, with 5 million pounds from China and the UK each. The participants on the British side were HSBC and Chartered Bank, and the Chinese side was the Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Bank.</p>
<p>(4) Sino-British exchange refers to the exchange behavior of legal currency and the pound sterling. The statutory price for the legal currency combined with British gold is one shilling and two and a half pence, so the statutory price of each pound of legal currency should be 15.48387 yuan. There is no difficulty in restoring this exchange rate, but it does not conform to the wartime trade policy at present.</p>
<p>(5) For those who study domestic financial issues, there are Yu Rong Dao Bao, Yin Qian Jie, Bank Weekly, and Central Bank Monthly in Shanghai; for those who study foreign financial issues, there are no specialized publications, but the Chinese and Foreign Economic Extracts Monthly has many such translations, and there are not many specialized dictionaries. You can refer to the Financial and Financial Encyclopedia (published by World Book Company) compiled by the reporter and Mr. Pan Wenan.</p>
<p>(6) It is better to read Yang Yinpu's Economic Common Sense than to read that book.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Qin's two questions, here are brief answers as follows:</p>
<p>(1) How many Hong Kong dollars are paid in Shanghai for 100 yuan of national currency. As for those who pay in Hong Kong and receive in Shanghai, there are other market prices in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>(2) The current spot price of Shanghai exchange in Hong Kong refers to the number of legal currency received in Shanghai for 100 yuan of Hong Kong currency paid in Hong Kong. The market prices of 440 and 445 you mentioned on May 8 are 440 to 445 yuan for Hong Kong currency paid in Hong Kong and legal currency received in Shanghai.</p>
<p>For the first point of your inquiry, Mr. Liang Zhi, please refer to Issue 3000 of this publication. The second point is due to the different relationship between the supply and demand of bills of exchange in the US and British markets at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e86">A Review of the Foreign Exchange Market This Past Week <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Economic Consulting Institute, the foreign exchange market last week, based on the trends at the end of the previous week, should have been trending downward. However, the opening on Monday was unusually stable, which was unexpected. The failure to decline as expected reflected that the downward trend had weakened. Consequently, Tuesday and Wednesday saw a gradual decline, while Thursday witnessed a sudden intensification of the tight trend, with the spot price of US dollars shrinking by 2.1875 in a single day. Friday and Saturday then showed a pattern of consolidation. Examining the factors that influenced the market fluctuations this week, we find the following points:</p>
<p>1.  There is a rumor that Britain has been asked to stop assisting the Chinese legal tender (fapi).</p>
<p>2.  A "new currency" is about to appear.</p>
<p>3.  Mr. Soong has been internally appointed as the Minister of Economic Warfare.</p>
<p>4.  There is an abundance of floating capital.</p>
<p>(1) The rumor that Britain has been asked to stop assisting the Chinese legal tender inevitably caused panic among the public. However, it is important to understand that China's maintenance of foreign exchange in Shanghai is primarily to protect the commerce of friendly nations, a noble intention involving significant sacrifices. Britain is unlikely to abandon this position. Should China be forced into such a situation, it would naturally seek alternative strategies. Moreover, the black market in Shanghai is a source of substantial leakage. Curbing this flow would further solidify the foundation of the fapi.</p>
<p>(2) The appearance of a new currency is also a stimulating factor. However, whether its reserves will be sufficient and whether the people will have faith in it remain uncertain. Furthermore, foreign merchants still find it beneficial to maintain the fapi and seem unwilling to create problems for themselves. Moreover, at the beginning of a "new regime," the impact on the foreign exchange market is limited. Even if a "new currency" is introduced, it is only one of its tools, and its impact on the fapi is predictable.</p>
<p>(3) There are rumors that T.V. Soong will become the Minister of Economic Warfare. The establishment of an Economic Warfare Department, as the name suggests, indicates its importance. Moreover, Mr. Soong strongly advocates for a sound fiscal policy. Given his character, assuming responsibility for economic warfare means that measures beneficial to the war economy will be implemented successively, and appropriate actions will be taken against the black market in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(4) Since the recent sharp declines in stocks, cotton yarn, etc., in Shanghai, hoarders have been selling off goods to raise funds, leading to a daily increase in bank deposits. Additionally, due to unrest in Southeast Asia, overseas Chinese have been continuously fleeing to Shanghai with their capital, reportedly reaching a massive amount of 150 million yuan recently. Moreover, domestic purchases of Shanghai goods and remittances to Shanghai have been substantial. As various streams converge, the floating capital in Shanghai is becoming increasingly abundant. Idle funds sitting and consuming interest are not a good strategy, and long-term stagnation leads to movement, so various markets are showing signs of activity. However, the foreign exchange market is closely related to other markets, with mutual cause and effect, as we stated last week. Currently, the foundation of the fapi is exceptionally solid, as can be seen from the figures provided by the Exchange Equalization Fund. The Exchange Equalization Fund was established in March of last year with a fund of 10 million pounds. After repeated use, it was estimated that around 1.5 million pounds remained by the end of April. After May, approximately 2 million pounds were gradually purchased. As of now, it is estimated that around 4 million pounds remain. Over the past 16 months, a total of 6 million pounds has been spent. At a rate of four US dollars per pound, the monthly expenditure is only 1.5 million US dollars. China has historically had a large trade deficit, which has naturally increased during wartime. The limited amount spent now demonstrates that our country has ample resources and is managing them properly, allowing us to respond comfortably even amidst these turbulent times.</p>

<p>— By Saint Ke Qiong</p>
<p>— Ending July 13th —</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange and Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Shanghai's financial situation has suddenly turned tense this past week. Foreign exchange has weakened, with the US dollar falling from 6.3125 on the 6th to 6.00 on the 13th. The British pound fell from 4.03125 to 3.890625. The former's fluctuation was 0.53125, and the latter's fluctuation was 0.171875. Foreign stocks are trending upwards, with the average price of common stocks rising by 16.10 this Friday compared to the previous Friday. Rubber stocks have seen an astonishing surge, rising by 103.38. Other markets related to foreign exchange have also seen significant turns towards bullishness.</p>
<p>The reason for the tightening of foreign exchange is partly due to the US president's declaration of the Monroe Doctrine and Japan's repeated requests to Britain to blockade the Burma Road from China. Speculators, who had been dormant for a long time, seized the opportunity to buy up currency. Importers followed suit, as merchants typically follow speculators. Seeing the foreign exchange market tightening, they feared further declines and decided to make arrangements while conditions were still favorable. As a result, merchants' activity was subdued at the beginning of the week. Later, importers made large settlements for hardware, machinery, foreign rice, wheat, cotton, tobacco, kerosene, etc. Looking at the closing prices, the extent of the decline was only one-sixteenth of a point for the US dollar in the first half of the week (due to pressure from speculators), but it expanded to seven-thirty-seconds in the second half of the week (due to pressure from merchants).</p>
<p>This week, 2,196,555 shares and 1,388 bonds were traded in the foreign stock market, with a total transaction value of 14.3 million yuan. The upward trend in foreign stocks was mainly driven by rubber stocks, with industrial stocks being pulled up as well. The fundamental factor behind the rise in rubber stocks is, of course, the influence of foreign exchange. However, the generous interim dividends announced by Kroewoek and Anglo-Java at the right time were also important factors.</p>

<p>Recently, the price of coal balls has been chaotic due to price competition among businesses, with secret deals being extremely disorderly. The industry association, recognizing that this situation cannot continue, convened a meeting and decided to set a uniform factory price starting today. The prices are as follows: Yitai Xing, Nanyang, and Guohua coal balls, self-delivery by the same industry, 138 yuan per ton. Delivery adds to the transport cost. The price for street stores is set at 7.5 yuan per dan.</p>

<p>The market for Gorgon euryale seeds has recently stabilized, and as the consumption is minute, the market yesterday was as follows: Top-grade Sichuan clear water Gorgon euryale seeds were offered at 900 yuan, Shashi at 600 yuan, and Hekou Gorgon euryale seeds with water were 440 yuan. Duobo goods were only 250 yuan, and because they are not suitable for sale, they are relatively sluggish.</p>

<p>It is reported that most of the North and South shops have already opened prices for the Haikou branches that arrived the day before yesterday. For example, Shuidong branches are 64 yuan, with prices reduced as needed. Ordinary Haikou branches are 25 yuan, all showing declines of several yuan each. The rest will open today, and there should not be any further fluctuations.</p>

<p>Recently, cigarette prices have continued to rise. For example, Dafu and Pin Hai brands, due to insufficient stock and strong demand from dealers, are selling very well in the market. Yesterday, the price of British brands rose again by 17 yuan per case, to 985 yuan. Pin Hai also rose by 8 yuan, to 655 yuan. Other brands, such as Old Knife, rebounded slightly by 2 yuan, to 758 yuan. Wuhua brand also rebounded slightly by 18 yuan, to 485 yuan. Little Fairy is 473 yuan. (Increased)</p>

<p>Although the market for Company Iron is constantly purchased by manufacturers, it has not been very strong due to sluggish business from out-of-town merchants. It is reported that the goods had once rebounded slightly, and recently due to the demand from local canneries, large quantities have been purchased, and toy factories and printing factories are also occasionally purchasing. In addition, Tianjin tobacco merchants have also been successively collecting them, so the thinking of colleagues has changed, and prices are slightly higher than before. The market price for 200-pound old steel mills is 180 yuan per box, and the new steel mill is 170 yuan per box, which is several yuan better than before. It is reported that the total transaction volume in the city yesterday was about 300-400 boxes.</p>

<p>Swimming (2)</p>
<p>For those who swim, first they must swim freely, their righteous energy is sufficient to overcome it, their true strength is sufficient to subdue it, therefore water cannot harm them. As they gradually swim longer and longer, their strength also gradually weakens, and their energy also gradually diminishes. When this time comes, they should immediately reach the other shore, and there will definitely not be any unexpected changes. If they still do not know when to stop and continue to support themselves again and again, then the power of the water will increase, and the true energy will decrease, and they will no longer be able to control themselves. After sinking once, their energy will be covered by the water. Once the energy is blocked and cannot come out of the water, then their death will be imminent. As for leaping into the water from a high place, at that time their strength can still be relied upon, but in this leap, all the energy has been exhausted. If they fall and cannot recover, how can one be sure of safety? To attribute this to the haunting of ghosts is to say that when there are no ghosts, one can lie in the water all day long and never die, which is absurd! The Public Works Department has issued a notice prohibiting naked bathing in the river, not only because nakedness is unseemly, but also because it poses a threat to life. Drowning people believe that it is caused by ghosts, so people fear ghosts more than water. If they believe that water cannot kill people, only ghosts can kill people, but there is water everywhere, and not necessarily ghosts everywhere, then when the summer heat is rising, they will follow each other into the water to seek a moment of pleasure, and if someone drowns, they will all say that it was done by a ghost, and that person's life was destined to end, and it is not the fault of the water. But then, when boats capsize in the heart of the river and everyone drowns, is it that everyone has a destined death and happens to meet it?</p>

<p>— By Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Planting bamboo in the courtyard requires only two or three stalks, swaying in front of the window, naturally adding a sense of leisure during the day.</p>
<p>Curtains not only block the sun, but even when hanging casually between the window beams, rippling like waves, they also add a beautiful touch. Occasionally, calling a clever maid to roll them up, with her jade-like face and silver fingernails, they create a picturesque scene, like unfurling a painting by Fei Xiaolou.</p>
<p>After dinner, strolling is best under the shade of wisteria and willows, by the pond, and in front of flowers.</p>
<p>Hanging one or two couplets in the room, preferably those with refined and unrestrained styles. If they are in the style of official calligraphy or contain moralistic sayings, they lose their charm. The couplets in my friend Wu Hufan's studio are all extremely delightful, truly capturing my heart.</p>
<p>Clothing made of kudzu fiber and shirts made of bamboo have become things of the past. In reality, wearing these on hot summer days is comfortable and cool, far superior to Western suits and modern fashions. Alas, why don't people value practicality?</p>
<p>When people live in the air, the placement of everything is well-organized and orderly. Sitting, lying, getting up, and living without being restricted by formalities make the mind and eyes comfortable and the body at ease. Whether reading, reciting poetry, writing books, composing music, burning incense, playing the qin, or wielding the brush, all can achieve a wonderful state.</p>
<p>A home should have one or two cats with beautiful fur as adornments, not only to eliminate rats.</p>
<p>When the weather is hot and steamy, like being in a blast furnace, occasionally entering an air-conditioned room feels like taking a refreshing tonic. But after only ten minutes or so, the coolness feels natural and one no longer appreciates its refreshing effect. I say that people in adverse circumstances hope for favorable circumstances, and when they are actually in favorable circumstances, they gradually feel that the favorable circumstances are ordinary, which is exactly the same.</p>
<p>I saw the so-called Chrysanthemum Chicken, a chicken with entirely black feathers, with white feathers scattered at the tips of its comb, resembling drooping chrysanthemum petals. There were also long-tailed chickens with tails a foot or two long, which were quite peculiar. Keeping one or two of these in the garden fence is quite enjoyable to watch. If one indulges in killing them to fill their belly, it is close to being boorish, like boiling a crane or burning a qin. Reading books and befriending ancient people, drinking wine and inviting the bright moon, is why literary figures are not harmed by loneliness.</p>
<p>Losing something and being reluctant to search for it, then a servant accidentally finds it while sweeping the floor, is a delightful thing.</p>
<p>Someone wanted to exchange a chicken-blood Changhua stone for calligraphy. It weighed more than ten pounds and had speckled vermillion marks. Its size was unprecedented. The poor scholar loved it but could not obtain it. Otherwise, placing it on the desk and quietly contemplating it would also be a pleasure of leisure.</p>
<p>A certain senior poet said, "Flowers fill the garden and attract butterflies, a pool of only half an acre also breeds fish." Having this small structure is enough to satisfy my wandering.</p>
<p>Listening to rain in a small building, watching clouds in a mountain pavilion, welcoming the wind in a waterfront pavilion, and facing the moon in a secluded courtyard are all suitable for people and places, allowing one to forget both oneself and things.</p>
<h3 id="e97">The Reaction to Wearing Short Clothes <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— By Chen Naichao</p>
<p>A few days ago, a gentleman advocated wearing short clothes in this newspaper. Indeed, short clothes are very convenient and cool in the summer, so I followed suit and promoted wearing short clothes, so that people in society can avoid the trouble of wearing long gowns in the future. The day before yesterday, I went to visit a friend in a certain building, and because he lived on the fourth floor of the building, I stepped into the elevator. The elevator was empty. After entering the elevator, the driver glanced at me, but the elevator remained still. After waiting for a while, I didn't tell him to start, wanting to see what he would do. Finally, a person dressed in a splendid gown walked in, and only then did the elevator start to ascend.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that Shanghainese look down on people wearing short clothes, thinking they are lower class. Usually, I always wear long gowns and suits. Sometimes when I go to the elevator in that building, whether there are passengers or not, it always rises straight up. But that day I wore short clothes, and the driver put his eyes on his forehead. Moreover, the short shirt and pants I wore that day were made of white spun silk, which can't be considered lower class! But I received such treatment. Why do Shanghainese look down on people wearing short clothes? Is it because they are impolite? No, probably in their eyes, people wearing short clothes are lower class.</p>
<h3 id="e98">The Art of Eating Zhui Li Plums <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— By Ping Xin</p>
<p>Chinese people are most particular about eating and are especially suited to art. Just taking drinking alcohol as an example, it is never like Westerners who gulp it all down at once, but rather holding the cup and drinking it mouthful by mouthful. Sometimes they even say "Please" to the people they are drinking with first.</p>
<p>Now, walking past the front of general fruit shops on the main road, you can always see plates of red plums on display. These are called Zhui Li plums, famous products from Jiaxing and Tongxiang.</p>
<p>The area of Jiaxing and Tongxiang was called Zhui Li in the Spring and Autumn period, and these fruit trees have been cultivated until now, so they have a history of several thousand years. Perhaps they are as old as the development of the Wu and Yue regions. In that case, we call Zhui Li plums a local fruit of the Wu and Yue region, comparable to "national flower" and "city flower," which should not be inappropriate.</p>
<p>The Zhui Li plum has a special mark. If you look at its bottom, there is a diagonal concave pattern, which is said to be the mark of Xi Shi's fingernails, because Xi Shi loved to eat Zhui Li plums the most.</p>
<p>The way to eat Zhui Li plums is not the same as other plums. No matter whether they are ripe or unripe, putting them in your mouth and gnawing on them gives about the same taste. If you eat Zhui Li plums in this way, then you are too much of an amateur, or you don't understand the art of eating Zhui Li plums.</p>
<p>How should they be eaten? Mr. Ke Yuan, who is experienced in cultivating Zhui Li plums, told me, "When Zhui Li plums are ripe, their color will change from green to yellow, but you can't eat them yet. You have to store them in porcelain, cover them well, and after about three or four days, open the lid, and they will emit a wine-like fragrance. This is when the Zhui Li plums are telling you that they can be eaten. But you still have to look at their color to see if they have all turned carmine red? You also have to move them with your hands to see if they are all as soft as persimmons? If you feel that the color, fragrance, taste, and touch are all perfect, then you can use a needle to pierce a small hole in the skin and suck with your mouth, and the contained nectar will be sucked dry, until only a skin and a pit are left. Only by eating them in this way can you appreciate the true taste of Zhui Li plums. Gnawing on them raw is okay for other plums, but it's absolutely impossible for Zhui Li plums."</p>
<p>Chinese people love to eat the most, and eating must have an art to it. The way to eat Zhui Li plums is the most suitable for art.</p>
<h3 id="e99">The Hygiene of Housing <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— By Ai Nong</p>
<p>In the hot summer, housing is most prone to problems. Mosquitoes and bedbugs adopt an air-land coordinated attack strategy, rampant in the house, especially in the寸金之地 on the isolated island. In recent days, they have been attacked by these airplanes (mosquitoes) and tanks (bedbugs), and it is unimaginable. In those pigeon-coop-like rooms, sunlight is hard to come by, and the heat inside is as terrible as a steamer. Those blood-sucking pests are certainly getting a good opportunity, and even more so, germs that cannot be seen with the naked eye are also breeding their race. In such a besieged environment, there is a possibility of causing disease at all times, so we must pay attention to the hygiene of housing.</p>
<p>We want to make the windows of the room large and numerous, preferably open the windows so that sunlight can freely enter. If there is plenty of sunshine and the room is bright, it will make people feel refreshed and also be very beneficial to health, because sunlight is a disinfectant. All germs cannot survive when they see sunlight. The window must be opened, because the ultraviolet rays that sterilize cannot pass through the glass. Once the window is opened, its sterilizing power will be discounted by 80 or 90 percent. The floor should be mopped and washed often, as this can reduce dust, because it is a medium for spreading disease. If you drop some smelly water into the water, you can also drive away traces of flies and jumping eggs, etc. Pouring a lot of smelly water in the damp corners of the walls will indeed have unexpected effects. It is important not to use a feather duster to dust the window sills, chairs and tables that are covered with a thick layer of dust. If you dust them, it will make the dust fly around, so it is better not to do it. In fact, the dust is not removed, but it is just moved to another place, so it is most appropriate to use a damp cloth to gently wipe it away. Don't close the windows at night, but don't open them all. It is best to open one or two, depending on the size of the room and the number of people living in the house, but one must be opened. The above points are the simplest and most basic aspects of housing hygiene, but they are easily overlooked.</p>
<p>Small Notes on Food and Nourishment</p>
<h3 id="e100">Mint <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— By Zhang Jingren</p>
<p>Mint is a labiate plant with a peculiar and pungent aroma. It tastes burning at first, then clear and cool. It contains a volatile oil and solid menthol. The menthol can be seen precipitating in the prepared mint oil, which can calm the wind and prevent spoilage. Today's mint lozenges are made from mint oil. Rubbing it on the head can relieve external wind and suppress liver yang, which has remarkable effects. Xu Xue Shi's Ben Shi Fang also says that for incessant nosebleeds, you can drop mint juice into the nose, or boil the dried mint in water, stuff cotton into the nose, and it will stop. Although this method has not been tested by others, I think it should have quick results. Traditional Chinese medicine uses it as a hand jueyin qi-level medicine because it can guide the yingwei of various medicines, so it can disperse wind-cold and treat various headaches and toothaches. Its action is absorbed into the blood through the intestinal wall, which can reduce the number of white blood cells. At the same time, it reaches the brain through the sympathetic nerves, anesthetizing it, so it can treat various pains. In summer, many people add mint water to mung beans as a snack to clear the head and eyes and prevent cholera and heatstroke. Moreover, the time between May and June is the appropriate harvesting period, which is also a time to taste new things. However, mint is widely produced, and the best is the one planted in Suzhou. The stems are small and fragrant, and it is suitable for medicine. Chen Shiliang's Shi Xing Ben Cao calls it Wu Balan (pronounced bā huo). Mint is probably a mispronunciation of Balan.</p>

<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>Eating more vegetables in summer is naturally good for health; however, eating only simple vegetables without varying the dishes can be too monotonous, so innovating dishes is something housewives must know. Among vegetarian dishes, we especially like the "Ten-Ingredient Vegetarian Quilt." How to eat "quilt"? Well, it looks very much like a quilt. The method is to first braise and finely chop Chinese cabbage, then finely chop dried tofu, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and wood ear, mix them with soy sauce and sesame oil, wrap them in tofu skin, shaping them like little quilts, lightly fry them in hot oil, then braise them. It tastes naturally delicious. Every summer during vegetarian season, this vegetarian "quilt" is considered a treasure on our family's table.</p>

<p>Living in this world is like being a student, receiving education every day, and it’s a matter of "learning until you are old." In the world created by God, only mankind can learn. Other creatures, like spiders spinning webs or bees building nests, are acting on instinct; they are born with the ability and do not need to learn! Even if we say that mankind can always learn, what exactly are we learning? A prophet named Isaiah from the Jewish nation told us that mankind should learn to do good. To learn to do good, we must first remove all wickedness from our own thoughts, because thoughts are the mother of actions. There can be no good actions without good thoughts. If we want to learn to do good, there are three points we should pay attention to:</p>
<p>(1) To learn to do good, one must have a model – who is our model? Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there have been many sages and philosophers, but everyone has some shortcomings and cannot be called a perfect person. The only one who can be called a perfect person is Jesus Christ, who is admired by all. This is not Christian followers excessively praising their teacher. Even Jesus himself would ask his enemies, "Which of you can accuse me of sin?" So, we might as well not learn to do good, but if we want to learn to do good, the only model is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>(2) To learn to do good, one must have the ability to learn – we often say that someone has talent, someone has the ability. If people must rely on talent for everything, without the ability to learn, then there is really too little hope. But where does the ability to learn come from? We know that this ability comes from being connected to Jesus. Because Jesus struggled with evil in order to do good and ultimately overcame evil. Putting people to death is the only means of evil, but even though Jesus was nailed to the cross, he rose from the dead. So, if we want to gain the ability to resist evil and learn to do good, we must be united with Jesus.</p>
<p>(3) Learning to do good lies in practice – Having a model for doing good and the ability to learn, we must also practice what we learn in our lives. "Be doers of the word, and not hearers only…" This is the encouragement that ancient believers gave us. Now that we know what is good and what is evil, we should immediately stop doing evil and actively do good; otherwise, it will be like what Mr. Wang Yangming said: "Knowing without doing is not yet knowing."</p>

<p>Friend! Do you feel that you are a sinner? People all over the world have the same mentality: thinking they are right and others are wrong, considering themselves righteous, and not knowing that they are all sinners before the Lord. The Bible says: "There is no one righteous, not even one; there is no one who understands; there is no one who seeks God. All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one." It also says: We were born in sin, and we had sin when we were conceived in our mother's womb. Because we are born in sin, we are most happy to commit sin. If we had no sin, Jesus would not need to come. The Lord sent His Son into the world to save sinners. Jesus saves sinners not through education; because education can only develop inherent talents, but cannot reform people's hearts; if evil people receive education, it is tantamount to providing bandits with firearms, because the smarter they are, the easier it is to commit crimes, and the higher the learning, the greater the possibility of doing evil. Jesus saves sinners even without morals, because morals can only confine people to walking on the right track, but cannot turn sinners into sinless people. Jesus saves sinners by giving up his own life and being nailed to the cross, so that the innocent died in place of the guilty, so that the guilty may be declared innocent before God. This is a fact that is not easily understood. Please listen to Paul's testimony, "Among sinners I am the worst." "For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing… What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death? Thanks be to God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!" Others such as Peter, John, Augustine, Martin Luther, Wesley... and even modern Christians, have all had their lives greatly changed by believing in Jesus, able to come out of sin, not only saving themselves and enjoying eternal life, but also benefiting mankind and leaving their names in history. Jesus is truly the Savior of sinners.</p>

<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 3: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>Old Mao suddenly pursed his lips, his rat-like eyes shifted several times, and he snorted through his nose. "Isn't it all about the money? Every time he stayed overnight, Jinmei would get some money, twenty dollars, ten dollars. Naturally, she would shut her mouth." "And you didn't get any money? Is that it?" "I don't want his money. Although I'm poor, I don't want to be a spy, I don't want to use that kind of money! I'm not just talking about him because I didn't get any money. That Zhao guy once wanted to give me two dollars, but I didn't take it."</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly looked up and interjected, "Oh, what do you think of this Zhao guy?"</p>
<p>Old Mao frowned tightly, as if he couldn't answer for a moment. After a pause, he said, "This—I can't really say anything about this person either. He's only been coming and going here for more than half a month, it seems he's Miss Wang's new friend, but their relationship seems even closer than old friends."</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"He's very busy coming and going when Manager Lu isn't here, sometimes he'll run two or three times a day. Whenever he comes, Miss Wang always welcomes him with a beaming smile. And that time Miss Wang had a big fight with that Yu guy, it was because of him." He suddenly stuck out his tongue, shrugged his shoulders, and made a face. "The vinegar jar was overturned, but Miss Wang was protecting him!"</p>
<p>"Does he stay overnight here?"</p>
<p>Old Mao shook his head and said, "No, but—"</p>
<p>"But what?"</p>
<p>Old Mao licked his lips again, suddenly showing a look of embarrassment, as if there was something he couldn't say, but he didn't seem as scared as before.</p>
<p>Hawthorne urged him again, "Speak, but what?"</p>
<p>Old Mao said in a low voice, "Sometimes Miss Wang might—maybe go to his place."</p>
<p>Hawthorne's eyes suddenly gazed at the light yellow latticed gauze curtains by the window, as if he was thinking about something, or as if he was listening to something. Then, he put his right leg on his left knee, leaned back in his chair, and continued to question Old Mao.</p>
<p>"Oh, is that so? How do you know?"</p>

<h3 id="e108">Living Standards and Rising Prices <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Wei</p>
<p>"Living expenses in Shanghai are really high now! Rice is selling for sixty or seventy yuan per picul!"</p>
<p>"A garret that used to cost six yuan a month now costs twenty yuan. Oh! Living expenses are really high!"</p>
<p>Readers! Do you think the above statements are correct? Do you say they are correct? But I say, some are correct, and some are incorrect.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because what is correct is that the rising rice prices and increased rents are both facts. What is incorrect is confusing rising prices with living standards.</p>
<p>Then what are living standards?</p>
<p>Living standards are living standards, referring to people's enjoyment of material life; for example, we say that the living standards of American workers are higher than those of Chinese workers, which means that the material enjoyment of American workers is better than that of Chinese workers; but the living standards of Soviet workers are even higher than those of American workers, which means that the food, clothing, housing, and transportation of Soviet workers are more comfortable than those of Americans; domestically speaking, the living standards of Shanghainese are higher than those of rural people, because they are more particular about food and clothing than rural people, and their housing is more comfortable than that of rural people: they have electric lights, running water... In terms of transportation, they are not like rural people, who still walk several miles; Shanghainese take trams even for half a mile... All aspects of enjoyment exceed those of rural people.</p>
<p>In this way, I want to ask you: Suppose you used to eat rice that cost a dozen yuan per picul before the war, but now rice costs sixty or seventy yuan per picul: but is this rice that costs sixty or seventy yuan per picul more or better than the rice that cost a dozen yuan per picul before the war? It is neither more nor better, right? (Perhaps it is less and worse!) This makes it clear that you are spending a lot of money, but what you get is still the same; this means that your living expenses have increased, but your living standards have not improved.</p>
<p>Then when will prices fall, and when will living standards improve?</p>
<p>The reason for rising prices, as everyone understands, is half due to "control" and speculation, and half due to war-related factors. (Because the lives of people in a country at war cannot be the same as in peacetime, it is inevitable.) But there is a contradictory phenomenon here, which is that many businesses and companies have made a lot of money due to rising prices, which is inversely proportional to the deterioration of workers' lives. This issue should be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Prices may fall, but perhaps they will not fall, but this is not a problem; what can be affirmed is that our living standards will inevitably improve. But this still requires us to fight for it! There is only one road, which is the one that most Chinese people are taking today.</p>

<p>— Zhu Wenbao</p>
<p>No Less Than a Hundred Bombs Falling from the Sky</p>
<p>The extreme severity of the rice shortage in Shaoxing has already been reported in the newspapers, but most people only know that it is severe and do not know how terrible it is. Today I received a letter from home, with a paragraph describing the misery of starvation, which I cannot bear to finish reading. It said: There are still many people starving to death? In just a few days, as many as fifty-three people starved to death in the Shaoxing urban area from the South Gate to Shuiman (approximately the distance from Shanghai's Sincere Company to the Polo Ground). In one family, the child starved to death first, and the parents watched helplessly as the child gradually became critically ill and gradually died, unable to save him. One person was starving to death, and a kind person gave him a bowl of rice. After eating, he had severe abdominal pain and went mad, jumping and darting around, accidentally hitting a stone and dying with a broken head. One person had starved to the point of being barely alive, collapsing on the street. The local constable, thinking he was dead, brought a coffin to collect the body, but the person turned over and groaned, "I want food! I'm not dead, I want food!" The local constable sighed and said, "How can I feed you?" He finally forcibly put him into the coffin. This kind of tragedy is worse than the ancient practice of exchanging children for food or cooking bones. I have already written to this point, my hands are trembling and my tears are flying from my eyes. Alas! What crime have my people committed to suffer this torment? I must publicly plead with all rice merchants and speculators in Shanghai to give us a little respite to save the lives of tens of thousands of ants. It is not only a great act of personal merit, but also slightly preserves the vitality of the country. The ancients said: Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda! If rice prices rise by one yuan today, it may seem insignificant in Shanghai; but in the interior, it is like a hundred bombs falling from the sky, and its impact is significant. Therefore, for your own sake and for the sake of your descendants, it seems that you should immediately lay down the butcher knife and turn back to the shore! I respectfully present the tragedy of starvation to all rice merchants, speculators, and financiers in Shanghai, and hope that they will give it careful consideration? In addition to submitting a petition to the Chongxue Supervision and Sacrifice Institute in the name of a Shaoxing native living in Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the local officials and unscrupulous financiers in Shaoxing, I also hope that my fellow Shaoxing natives living in Shanghai will rise up to save their hometown.</p>

<p>— Li</p>
<p>Regarding the scandal of cheating in poverty scholarships, I have an opinion, which is that students who enjoy poverty scholarships should have an obligation to serve the school. For example, helping the library with organizing work, or doing labor services such as cleaning other classrooms and laboratories. Like the previous "self-reliant student" program at a certain vocational school, which involved working one hour a day in exchange for one yuan per week, which could amount to more than twenty yuan per semester to subsidize tuition, the method was very good. If poverty scholarships also stipulate that "only those who are willing to provide labor services can enjoy them," it will surely reduce the goals of general competitors and prevent the chaotic scramble.</p>

<p>People are well-fed and healthy, counting the remaining years beyond seventy,</p>
<p>Content with coarse grain on a lonely island, grieving for the poverty in my homeland deprived of food.</p>
<p>Talking of ripe rice with double ears is never easy, the dried up springs in countless valleys are bleak,</p>
<p>Thinking of the places where I used to fish, so many people with no color in their faces.</p>
<p>Hearing news from home pierces my heart, cooking smoke about to cease for thirty days,</p>
<p>Who lies trapped and thirsty in the ruts, ashamed and sorrowful I explore the bottom.</p>
<p>With disheveled hair and official hats, let's all strive hard, perhaps we'll find spring in the remote mountains,</p>
<p>It's no small matter when it comes to starvation, quickly teach our compatriots not to lag behind.</p>

<p>The other day, a maid surnamed Zhang from my neighbor's house was fired. The reason given for the dismissal was that after the price of rice rose to nearly seventy yuan per stone, the employer limited each of their hired maids to only two bowls of rice per meal, but the maid insisted on having three bowls per meal.</p>

<p>It is said that the sales of postcards in the post office are much better than before. This at least reflects the increasing decline in the purchasing power of the masses. Even sending letters must be calculated. It is expected that once the long-rumored postal rate increase comes into effect, the postcard business will definitely be even better!</p>
