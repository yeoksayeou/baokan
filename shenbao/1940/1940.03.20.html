<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際之醞釀與歸宿</h3>
<p>義大利首相墨索里尼氏與德意志元首希特勒氏，於隔昨十八日上午，相約在義國邊境勃倫納山隘，會晤於列車中，作二小時半之長談。所談主題必關國際大局，所談影響必關和戰前途。國際和戰將如何，禍福之辨，吾泰之機，實繫乎此。顧乃舉世視聽所集而事後見聞所得，僅曰義首相笑容可掬，德元首意態矜持，他無所知。夫豈吾人耳目不周之咎，吾人且深信參預密勿之三五人外，莫得而知之。彼容態之間，允未可捕風捉影而曰個中自有所透露焉。儘多臆測之辭，宣傳之說，縱使他日事實證明，談言微中，究非現實之確知確報也。</p>
<p>即就種種臆測與宣傳而論，較盛者二說：一曰，兩國領袖亟謀所以穩定東歐與巴爾幹；一曰，義德兩國將邀的蘇聯共作和平攻勢云。由前之說，德國茲亦有戒懼於蘇聯；由後之說，義國茲亦願結歡於蘇聯。二說矛盾，至少必有一非，吾人則疑其皆非。他勿申論，義大利志切維持巴爾幹與東歐之均勢，尤願調整之，和諧之，改進之，絕不樂聞予以更張，加以宰制；質言之，穩定之道，義國但願德國或德蘇兩國對此無所舉動，決非德國所能使義國對此有所舉動；義國如此意態，久而彌著，藉曰不然，上週德國外交部長里賓特洛浦氏聘問義京時，必知義國如此意態，謂更勞德元首躬赴鄰邦作推動之嘗試耶？義國對蘇聯，在意識取攻勢，在行動取守勢；德國而能緩衝其間，既極居間能事，若拉攏義蘇，則不但抝義國之意識，且將使之遠美國，絕英法，棄袵席而入水火；遑論義國不出此舉，亦為德國不作此想；即使德國想之，亦非德元首所欲躬親輕試。故此二說之不必置信，僅覘於義大利之態度而可曉然者也。</p>
<p>觀察國際近况，正在多方醞釀中；醞釀之動嚮為排難解紛，故必醖釀失敗且絕望，始見趨於惡化；否則，假以時日，濟以人事，豁然開期可期也。若作大膽解釋，則芬蘇和的之告成，乃蘇聯有鑒於國際所醞釀，始制事機先，放棄其進攻芬蘭之最高願望，犧牲其控制芬蘭之最大可能，以確定其對芬收穫於國際醞釀褐曉之前；此誠政治外交上卓犖古今之策略術數，日本曷足　語此。吾人誠無以肯定國際醞釀之詳細內容，試舉蛛絲馬跡；美國國務副卿威爾斯氏奉命聘問義德英法之前，頻傳華盛頓與莫斯科之美蘇兩國使節，各與其駐在國當局作頻繁之接觸；接觸內容，雙方諱莫如深，於此當然可作種種不同之推論，然兩國見解之距離，無論為遠為近，其並不隔閡而知己知彼，是可想見矣。威爾斯氏之行，雖美國總統與國務卿俱稱威氏非負積極作為之使命，然於其既行而美總統即遨遊海上；此無他，期待威氏者深且切也；威氏不辱使命，故赴義德之後，義德領袖有晤談之必要，威氏自英法而重至義京，有暫留之必要。觀於威爾斯氏先羅馬柏林，後巴黎倫敦，所得反應判然，蓋義德强烈而英法溫順；以意度之，美國同情英法而不盡袒英法，英法所感者美國同情，所憾者未見美國同步伐；美德見解必殊，然德國主張有修正之地；義國者，謂介於英法與德國之間，實介於德國與美國之間。德國於芬蘇交戰之際，袒蘇而抑芬，所冀芬蘇息戰而蘇聯助德者更厚；乃芬蘇媾和之後，未見德國要人趨蹌於莫斯科，但見外長與元首接踵而至義國；謂非謀利尤亟於備戰之一證歟？綜此各方形跡，則與其謂國際所醞釀者，縱橫裨闔，鈎心鬥角，固無寗謂為排難解紛之為愈也。在此醞釀之中，蘇日談判以失敗聞，中美貸款以成功聞，蓋惟日本在醖釀之圈外。芬蘇既和，歐戰未臻高峰而有遽趨下游之勢；日本寖成矢的，鎩羽東歸，期不在遠，拭目以視可也。</p>

<h3>質問對英外交　日衆院一塲騷擾　議員揮拳頓足大駡有田　警衛隊干涉竟引起衝突</h3>

<p>倫敦　今日下午下院聆首相張伯倫宣述目前之大局時、眾心殊形殷切、顯呈緊張之象、美大使甘納第坐於外交人員席蘇聯大使邁斯基之次位、中比法土阿真廷大使較小若干國之公使與自治領駐倫敦辯事專員亦均列席、首相起立、甫言及芬蘭時、眾皆歡呼、首相謂政府最初所抱大慘劇業已發生之印象、決無事物可更變之、試就芬蘇媾和條件一加考慮、徒能證實此項條件、唯受直接強迫始能予以接受之見解、今假定此項條件並不嚴重危害該國之獨立與完整、亦屬無益、芬人久持與英勇之防衛、卒不能抵抗數衆械精之敵人、此實爲一切實愛自由者痛苦之概念、但芬人之抵抗亦非徒耗赤血、彼等已保全芬蘭之光榮、博得全世界之景仰、（眾歡呼）芬蘭政府今依然在職理政、芬蘭之陸軍今完整如故、芬蘭人民之精神未被擊破、假使吾人處於本國、雖已盡力之所能、而仍未能挽救芬蘭之厄運、吾人援助芬蘭之權力今殆尚未告終止也、（眾歡呼）、吾人應以全深切之同情注視芬蘭再造其國民生活之努力、設芬蘭續需援助以圖再與者、則敢料本國與他國必樂於共同輔助芬蘭之重行蘇生也、芬蘭抗戰之崩潰、已使全世界深爲震動、吾人因復被迫目覩另一小國爲侵略國之犧牲物、故已執戈起抗矣、預料德國宣傳必將利用今次之事變、卸除彼等之責任、而以此加諸他人之肩、但德國決不能規避其責任也、（歡呼）若無德蘇之協定、芬蘭決不致受蘇聯之侵略、斯堪的那維亞諸國本擬出援芬蘭、因懾于德國之恫嚇而止、今若謂英法兩國未能盡其義務、竭力供給芬蘭之所需、此言也、不能須臾予以容納、（歡呼）設此言發自遠距戰事諸國中之私人、（首相言至此、爲延長歡呼聲所掩、未能聆清）若輩對於其友人或自己、從未感覺任何關切也、首相於是謂渠對於援助芬蘭問題、擬分兩項言之、即物質之援助、與人力之援助是也、關於物質一節、因本國現正在戰爭中、故凡友好中立國之來請助、皆須就英國自己之所需而加以衡量、芬蘭之所申請者、英政府固願一一應之、但須考量所給予之任何物、皆將減少其自己之實力、而使其本國人民受有危險、要知芬蘭遠距英國、所接濟之物品皆冒有危險、而須假道兩外國、沿業已載運過量之鐵路綫　條、于是由鐵路通過芬蘭之長程、而此鐵路者、從未料及將運輸此項軍需也、雖困難重重、但芬蘭之籲請、英政府並未置之不答、每有所請即予考慮、首相於是臚舉所允接濟之戰品與業已運出之數目、謂英政府允助芬蘭飛機一百五十二架、其中一百零一架業已運出、允助炮二百二十三尊；業已運出一百　四尊、允助炮彈二十九萬七千　百枚、業已運出十八萬五千枚、允助維克炮百尊全數運出、允助水雷五百具、已運出四百具、允助手榴彈約五萬枚、全數運出、允助飛機炸彈兩萬零七百枚、已運出一萬五千七百枚、允助抵制坦克車來福槍二百支·發熱器六萬具·羊皮衣十萬件·戰衣十萬件·救傷車四十八輛、均全運出、此外尚助以大批小軍器與槍彈等物、英國毫未猶豫、寗使自己受有危險、而盡力應付芬蘭之需求、首相至是乃涉及人力援助問題、謂在一月中旬、芬蘭陸軍總司令孟納與上將曾告知英代表、謂芬蘭軍力足以支持至雪融之時、故一時不需人力之援助、孟納與上將曾謂、渠殊樂於五月間獲三萬戰士、但皆須受有訓練者、同時芬蘭與瑞典皆以德國之反動爲懼、故兩國皆望如果派軍援芬、勿出諸公然、英內閣於研究局勢後、覺援芬之有效軍隊、未能依志願投效基礎募之、五月間所需之軍隊、僅能就政府定制募之、而編成正當組織之遠征軍、內閣乃草定計劃、而提交二月二日舉行之最高軍事參議會討論之、遠征軍十萬人已整裝待發、較孟納與上將所約之期提早兩月、遠征軍之建設計劃、有數重要因素須予考慮、蓋有效的遠征軍非假道挪威瑞典、不能開抵芬蘭、故出發之前、必須請准於該兩國政府、至於德國之態度不言可喻、吾人知德國一聞英法遠征軍將假道兩國之謠諑後、即向兩國威脅、如允假道則德國將出而干涉、吾人至是覺尚須另備他軍、俾瑞典爲德攻時、援以抗德、如兩國政府允許假道、而運輸上之困難、尚須　此大軍受有限制、吾人　此情勢、乃決義就吾人須應付一切困難之所許、遠派至多之軍隊、軍隊之一部分將用以援助瑞典、另一部分作爲援芬之遠征軍、此外尚需若干軍隊維持交通長綫、根據此項基礎所決定派遣之軍隊、其數約十萬人、皆配備齊全者、並商定于三月間開始行抵斯堪的納維亞、全軍于四月杪前到達目的地、此並非最後軍隊、增援問題將視戰事之發展決之、</p>
<p>英政府曾于二月下旬以此項計劃告知芬蘭、且言如繼續需援助、宜在三月五日前提出公開籲請、吾人　接此公開籲請、即擬正式申請挪威瑞典兩國政府允許遠征軍之假道、吾人希望芬蘭籲請之結果、該兩國政府不致有所梗阻、但芬蘭非正式商諸瑞典政府時、瑞典政府即不允正規軍之假道、吾人接此消息、甚爲沮喪、但吾人遣軍之准備並不因此停止、吾人仍希望瑞典挪威兩國政府變更其意志、勇負其後果、允許吾人以己爲芬蘭備就之援助給予芬蘭、三月初、芬蘭請吾人准許彼等延緩其決議、但至約定之日、芬蘭決未有何決議、翌日、吾人聞芬蘭已接受蘇聯之和平條件矣、吾人殊未便批評芬人之所爲、英勇抗戰如芬人者、必須予以原諒、而勿加以任何訾議、首相繼謂渠於一點願使之絕對明瞭者、即英政府始終承認芬人有就彼等所知之事實、自定其決議之構是、英國無論有何主張、當接受芬人自定之決議、芬蘭除孟納與上將請于五月間助以戰士三萬人外、未作他種陸軍之申請、</p>
<p>首相復鄭重聲稱、挪威與瑞典如尤英法遠征軍通過、則早可到達芬蘭、渠敢立言英法對於挪威兩國在此事件中之行動、始終未加責備、（歡呼聲作）、然則德國又如何乎、此次芬蘭戰事之責任、實完全應出德國負之也、首相又對於挪瑞兩國之是否保持　安全、表示懷疑、反之、渠意兩國之危險、殊較任何時更爲接近、今日兩國禍已及門、吾人對于其所處之地位自必須表示若干之同情、兩國原意彼遠離擾亂之中心、不致遭受捷克與波蘭之命運、渠不得不指出此種中立主義、致使兩國之行動、陷于麻痹狀態者、實根據一種假定、以爲小國守中立者、置身于德國與協約國之戰爭外爲最佳之上策、此外更有一種概念、即不論戰事之結果、獲勝者爲德國抑屬協約方面、對于各小中立國、皆無關系也、一矣上述之假定概念放棄、並由此獲得必要之推論、則此項小中立國之政策、將證明其既不合現實、又不足以保障其本身之利益、除決定自衛並與准備援助彼等之防禦者聯合、將別無挽救之方云、</p>
<p>首相最後述及美國務副卿威爾斯之訪英、稱政府曾予以歡迎、並向之充分坦白表示意見、渠信威氏必能獲知英國各方面之真正意見與情緒、威氏返至義大利之時、適遇一新事件發生、即兩獨裁者在勃倫納隘口之會晤是、此項會晤自引起外間種種之推測、有謂係進行新和平提議者、但是否確實尚不可知、惟不論其後果如何、英政府已准備予以應付、吾人似不致因此而脫難吾人加入此次戰事之目的云、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<h3>德外交部喉舌　駁斥波蘭白皮書　指波決心參加包圍德國陣綫　致德改善對波蘭關係終于失敗</h3>
<p>柏林　關于波蘭政府在巴黎所發表之白皮書、德外部喉舌「德意志外交政治通訊報」昨日著文加以駁斥、力言波蘭之決心加入同盟國、包圍德國之集團、使德國欲促進德波關系之努力、歸于失敗、該項白皮書中、指陳德蘇兩國關係、在一九三四至一九三八年間、並不良好、誠哉斯言、柏林莫斯科以及全世界各國亦承認德蘇兩國拒絕西歐國家之挑撥、不願彼此作戰因而言歸于好之事實、波蘭流亡政客雖欲以曩日之德蘇關系、挑撥今日之德蘇邦交、奈何此英邦交、今已根深蒂固、德政治家對于離間之詞、但以一笑置之耳、其次、關於波蘭白皮書中所稱、波蘭從未要求但澤自由市一點、德國官方指陳但澤自由市之歷史、充滿關於避免波蘭政治上·經濟上·文化上侵略之事實、且波蘭外交部長柏克、去年三月二十六日、所以拒絕德國對于但澤及走廊之提議者、完全受英國之影響、第三、波蘭白皮書中對于一九三九年四月至八月間之事實、敘述甚少、足見英法兩國、不許波蘭宣　英國鼓勵及推動波蘭之經過、同時表明波蘭并無何種文件，足以證明「對日耳曼民族之忠實態度、」最後關于白皮書中所稱波蘭直至八月三十一日晚始知德國提議一點、德官方鄭重駁斥、認爲係一再撒謊、事實上八月三十日德政府即已通知英國大使漢德森、漢氏當即轉告波蘭大使、報告華沙政府云、（十九日海通電）</p>

<h3>美國國際新聞社記者　楊格氏在日被捕案　美籍律師阿樂滿先生　從國際法規上之分析</h3>
<p>美國國際新聞社駐日記者楊格氏、前被日本警務當局逮捕、迄今猶在覊押中、最近　日本外務省發言人宣　、楊格氏之行動、實違反日本陸軍懲戒法第九十九條、而且依據該項法規第三條之規定、即對於在日本國國境以外散佈無稽謠言之人、亦一律適用、此事件將來如何發展、如何結束、目前尙未能逆料、本市美籍律師阿樂　先生、精研法律、今就國際法規、加以分析、　以　證、頗為周詳、茲摘要譯　如左、</p>
<p>美國新聞記者一人，近在日本　控、致使一般注意、集中於關於國際公法一　的兩種　反見　之上，其中一種見解、以為在甲國中所作的行動、即使有犯罪性質、不能在乙國為罪行、另一種見解是、一國對於某種行動、即使是在該地領土以外所作的、　可作為罪行而加以懲罰、照第一種見解、以犯罪的地方為管轄權的測定、而在抱相反見解的國家、則以被吿之身在其國內為管轄的測定、</p>
<p>有些重要國家、對於非本國人民在他國領土內所犯之罪、不施以管轄樣、抱這種見解的重要國家是美國、但英國·丹麥·和葡萄牙·出抱同樣見解、這幾國似都抱按照國際公法、各國對這種案件、都不得施以管轄權的見解、而這些國家的管轄權、是受犯罪地方法律所支配的、</p>
<p>「一八四四年八月七日、美國國務卿卡爾霍恩致當時美國駐英大使艾　萊特的訓令中、明白地綜述美國的見解、這訓令中的一節、據摩爾國際公法彙編所載如下、「在一國所作行動、照該國法律縱是罪行、照另一國的法律、却不是罪行、在法律意義上、罪行是當地的、因為成為罪行的行為、所在國的法律宣布這種行為益罪行、所以在當地才是罪行、英國不能藉其法律使在美國管轄區內所作的行為無論其本身如何不道德、在英國領土內成為罪行、反之、美國也是如此、這前提極為明白、無需闡明或加爭論、但這點若加承認、那末、還有一點也須加以承認、便是附書中述及的罪行、須用犯罪所在地方的法律來判斷、而不用逃犯被發現地的法律來判斷、」</p>
<p>但是、有些重要國　、雖然實施辦法逈異、都不遵守這領土原則、這些國家多半對於違反該國安全或名譽的罪行、即使全在他國領土內作的、也都要求施以管轄權、墨西哥·希臘·蘇聯·巴西·和中國、對其自己法律和「犯罪地方法律」、都指為是罪行的犯法案件、似乎都稱有管轄權、奧地利·法國·德國·比國·荷蘭·義國·挪　·日本·和其他幾　、對於外國人在他國所作違反這些國家的安全或名譽的行動、都　有管轄權、</p>
<p>美英兩國對於非本國國民的案件、尤其是尋常罪行事件、幾乎專根據領土和個人的理由、才要求管轄權、兩國都在某種程度上承認普遍條規、例如海上行刦便是、但也有與這嚴格的領土和個人理論不同的情形、因為美國一九一四年移民法第二十二節、規定在入境申請書中、如有偽證或欺騙情事縱在國外所犯的、也可加以懲罰、外國人在海外不能犯背叛美國之罪、但似可按照一種或多種國法、對於背叛美國的行動、加以審理、</p>
<p>除英美兩國之外、雖多數國家對於犯破壞該國安全和名譽之罪的、和其他許多罪行的非本國國民、都　有權管轄、但奇怪得很、違犯上　種種法律的出名案件却不多、如克丁案·蓮花號案·蕭氏案·和高英案·可算是著稱的案件、</p>
<p>克丁案</p>
<p>一八八六年、美國公民克丁氏、在美國台克薩斯州厄爾派索地方某報刋載通吿、批評墨西哥公民梅迭那的某種訴訟手續、因此、克丁在墨西哥的厄爾巴索台爾諾特地方受審繫獄、判處徒刑一年和罰錢、美政府力　抗議、克丁才經墨西哥齊華　　方的最高法院釋出、</p>
<p>蓮花號案</p>
<p>一九二六年八月二日、將近午夜、法國郵輪蓮花號、駛往君士坦丁堡、在錫格里角以北五六海里之間、與土耳其運煤船波七柯特號相撞、波士柯號被撞成兩截而沉沒、船上土耳其人八名罹難、蓮花號盡力營救遇難者救出十人、然後繼續駛往君士坦丁堡八月三日到達該地時、蓮花號瞭望員台蒙斯大尉便濟逮捕、被指犯過失殺人罪、法國政府對於土耳其法庭的管轄權、加以爭論、理由是、若果犯罪、那末、這罪是在公海中法國船上犯的、而法國把法船看作是法國領土、所以只有法國才有權審問台氏、一九二七年、法土兩國商妥將這案件交國際常設法庭審理、該法庭判定有兩重管轄權、但法庭各法官抱兩種見解、各佔半數、由首席法官投決定票、抱異見的法官之一摩爾法官所抱見解、也許表明了法國的見解、同時亦述明了美國的見解、他的意見是、土耳其要求管轄權、違反國際公法的下列三種原則、</p>
<p>（一）一國對國士的管轄權是獨有的、</p>
<p>（二）外國人遊歷一國、須服從當地法律並須向該國法庭覔取司法上保護、</p>
<p>（三）一國不得指外國人違背其犯罪時無須服從的法律而加以懲罰、</p>
<p>蕭氏案</p>
<p>英人蕭氏、僑居中國安東、一九二〇年赴朝鮮、日當局指蕭氏在中國時、有違反日本法律的行動、將他拘禁數月、英政府要求解放、其所持理由中、有一項是蕭氏在這情勢中、應受英國在華領判權管轄、不因其在華任何行動而受日方管轄，四個月後、蕭氏釋出、大約未受正式審問、</p>
<p>高英案</p>
<p>中國駐美領署人員高英，與美人幾名、買賣麻醉品事有關、本可在美國或在中國加以審問、結果、高英是回中國受審的、這也許是美當局因為高英有官方關係、為兩國友好起見、所以不在美國審問、而聽其受本國當局之審問、</p>
<p>這類案件、甚為稀少、推求其故、也許是各國對於這事、見解互異、且這種案件發生時、被吿的本國政府、常提出有力抗議的緣故、</p>
<p>甲國對於乙國國民因在甲國管轄以外的地方犯罪，而加審問、這種舉動、常引起國際間的磨擦、許多國家、今巳訂定與這事有密切關係的引渡條約、或可免除這種性質的許多案件、</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况、滙，掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市，情况依舊盤旋、結果雖略硬化，但潛勢似又醖釀趨軟、蓋投機商鑒於希特勒與墨索里尼會晤結果、對西綫和平、旣無進展、且有助長戰事加劇之可能、本日外電曾傳德義蘇三國行將簽訂軍事同盟、亦屬威脅英法讓步、接受和平之用意，恐前途重形惡化、故人心均視定美英滙兌有復跌之虞、是以當日扒美者居多、反之英匯少人問津　而遠期較現貨變動稍大、乃因午後電訊、美國國務卿否認調停歐洲之消息釗來、經營者意志更堅、多　捨近扒遠矣、</p>
<p>晨初過程尙鬆動</p>

<p>投機　復扒遠期</p>
<p>後市初開仍為四辦士一四〇六二五及六元半、嗣因電傳美國國務副卿威爾斯否認調停歐洲和平之說、致頓吸引一般投機商復來扒進遠期美滙、故美滙現期即吿微緊、計華商扒進外行下月份美滙六元三七五、為紐約十餘高元、及有利吸進外行本月份美匯六元四六八七五、斯時現美滙亦祇六元四六八七五可結、入後大通對於現貨尙有　意，故現貨美匯遂吿回平、期貸則仍軟化、延至收盤、英金四辦士一四〇六二五、美匯六元半、本月份英金四辦士一二五、美匯六元四六八七五、下月份英金四辦士〇六二五、美匯六元三四三七五、結果比上日現貨英鬆〇一五六二五，美硬〇三一二五、期貨本月英平美賤〇三一二五、下月則英美滙均無軒輊、</p>

<h3>歐局動盪不定　金價易漲難跌</h3>
<p>昨日現金拾赤暗盤巿况、跌後陡起、金價易漲難落、斯言不寥也、致五千元大關數度退入後、重行回出、實因外匯先鬆後回、且有美國副卿否認調停歐洲戰事訊、和平空氣驟淡所致、各方人心極形不定、初受美英間匯兌暴漲、外匯英平美鬆、故開後售者踪接、尤以上日猛吸之某證券帮突吐、買賣不敵、價曾退達四千九百七十元、不意「某銀行」見低又委證券帮傾進、午刻市勢轉疲為堅、下午該行旣再進不止、且美卿否認調解歐戰、漲勢更銳、逐步飛上達五千零四十五元、終見散多吐出且外匯止緊回平、重轉疲色、收市五千零二十八元、僅微降二元、全日交易共三千數百兩、飾金亦跌後回平、仍五百十元、關金等一致勿更、</p>
<p>烚赤祗跌二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開匯巿均吿鬆動、人氣甚餒、一片喊賣聲、開巿即退落三十元、金號出銀號五十兩、為五千元、少頃於證券帮金號競賣中、再小十八元、證券帮出錢兌業十兩、為四千九百八十二元、嗣賴某銀號吃胃驟濃、且斯時匯市美匯轉軟、銀樓帮及金號亦進、遂回起二十一元、錢兌業出某銀樓三十兩、為五千零零三元、第因某證券帮復賣、又塞出二百數十兩、再被壓低十八元、證券帮售予金號二十兩、為四千九百八十五元、此後某錢兌突　來猛扒而證劵帮已無賣意、復回升二十元、銀號出金號五十兩、為五千零零五元、旋乃匯市重吿走鬆、錢況業及金號爭先葉出　同時散戶亦賣、重又跌落三十五元、錢兌業出證券帮三十兩、為四千九百七十元、後幸某證劵帮突來復進、而其時港帮亦有搜人、且外匯復又轉定、遂再見回高四十五元、銀號出金號五十兩、為五千零十五元、午刻扒者漸缺、銀號乘高塞出、步小十元、銀號五金號　十兩、為五千零零五元、作午收價、午後巿勢漸轉堅定、初開即高十元、銀號進金號二十兩、為五千零十五元、繼因銀號續來搜入、再步高七元、銀號進證券帮三十兩、為五千零二十二元、後銀樓帮吐出、始做小十二元、銀號互做十兩、為五千零十元、嗣後某證券帮復來拖進、再以港帮從中活　、而　匯斯時亦報帶緊、遂抬起三十五元、某銀樓進銀號五十兩、為五千零四十五元、入後另一證券帮忽來吐出、且現美匯忽報回硬、而買者巳中止扒吸、遂回落　十九元、證券帮出金號五十兩、為五千零十六元、後賴某錢兌業力進、重復向上、拉起十二元、某錢兌業進證券帮五十兩、為五千零二十八元作晚收價、結果比上日軋跌　元、全大七十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金先小後大</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、大同行仍懸五百十元、迨至九時半掛小五元、下午三時三十五分回大五元、終則平平、大同行依舊　五百十元、新同行與上　相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣堅疲不一</h3>
<p>昨日外幣巿倪、美金票猶動邊不定、晨以英鎊價格急遽回漲甚勁、黑巿美滙有鬆未已、致會跌全十五元一角三分、入後各方需要稍增、午間回上至十五元二角二分、午後忽傳美副國務　不致參加歐洲任何談判英鎊價格或將重趨低落、一般神經過敏者、因又爭購、三點後突然抬至十五元三角、卒又退為十五元二角六分、英金票先漲後跌、英美金鎊及香港票供求尙衡、法郞票及斐律濱票趨勢軟弱、僅新加坡票及荷蘭票驟有需要、安南票亦不乏需者、日金票仍在緩步挺進中、晚巿高至一元三角二分五厘、朝鮮票潛勢呆定、昨日巿價、計英金票及　律濱各跌五分、美金票降六分，法郞票落　厘、新加坡票及荷蘭票均漲三角、安南票亦升五分、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3>證劵　公債逢高出售　洋股收盤見跌</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日巿况因巿價連漲數日、稍趨安定丙種曾抬高至四十九元六角、旋以逢高求售蠢起、當即回落、刻下暫因舞碼缺乏、故市價仍不易遽回、戊種曾衝出九元關、旋即回進、趨勢當有一度平定，人心則仍甚堅穩、昨日上午在聯益大慶鴻康等買進中、各債再好二三角、旋以久豐聯和信孚同順等賣出而回疲、同康樂茂昌記等雖仍有需要、而市氣巳覺無力、午前與隔昨、市價大致相仿、午後信孚久豐昌記續有買進、聯和續有吐出、同　亦轉買為　、餘如泰　天生等均有拋售、價安定無榮辱、結果高低互見、為數又祇五分一角而已、成交約有一百餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交紗布交易所股五十股，價為四十四元　角半、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所巿况、上午因交割無巿　午後初開食風殊盛、故交易頗旺、價尙堅定、至上海銀公司及會德豐股最近在此一百三十五元新高價綫上、巨量進出、誠如余所逆料者也、收盤前售者復旺、致各股均遭挫跌、迄收盤仍疲、但賣風之起、並無原因可言、祇歐局之和平是否有實現之希望耳、橡皮股依然不振、理由與上相似、</p>
<p>倫敦十八日（週一）電、今日中國外債掛牌行巿、漲跌參見、英德續借款（英發）與善後借款（英發）各跌一鎊、前者為五十八鎊、後者為三十九鎊、北寗鐵路公債獨升二鎊、為五十七鎊、其餘告平、</p>
<p>倫敦十八日（週一）電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行巿、大致均吿平穩、僅古拉客林傍橡皮股獨跌七便士半、為二十鎊七便士半、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米大跌</h3>
<p>昨日米市依然下游、跌勢已不若前之猛烈、雖早市開手、作客觀望、浮囤散戶猶續脫手、各貨行情曾落一元半光景、但後一般作客見原根不脫、而視各價乃似跌透、遂有乘廉動辦、所以午市形勢漸轉帶緊、行情亦步回昂、惟比之前巿又小半元至元許也、計收盤一號西貢三十八元半、二號三十五元、特暹　三十七元、二號三十五元二角半、火絞三十六元半、三十六元、小絞三十五元二角、三十五元、混合碎三十一元十三角、三十一元、糯米價盤既廉、見洋米復呈徘徊、貨主遂均不肯經售，結果呈平疲之局、厚薄粳早晚稻等國米，由虹口轉出者漸旺、昨有二千餘包、塲外暗盤聞又疲頺近元、巿上次貨未有出樣、無巿、</p>
<p>洋米連朝慘跌後、更受來貨與棧租銀根等數重壓力、巿形繼續看小、昨日開市後賣氣愈旺、一號西貢大巿貨小至三十七元五六角、回籠貨有浮戶貶脫、市形更見虛軟、現洋米亦跌一元二三角、後因引起實銷一度回好　四角，但回籠貨一號西貢原包開四十八元半二號四十四元半、午後均乏受主、上午小絞四十四元、午後降至四十二元七角、而人心依然不振云、</p>
<h3>麵粉平賣期滿　廠盤陡增三元八角</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨為現粉平賣期滿之最後一天、二號粉廠盤經廠方與工部局一再磋商、擬就每包增加三元八角、改為十三元八角之價、而廠盤經此決定後、則平賣事件、無形打銷、而當局與各方均希望繼續廉價平賣、若與目下米價慘跌而論、則粉廠之增加、未免過速且巨也、聞廠方以廠盤旣增至十三元八角對於本街即可儘量供應、故回籠粉市頗受影響、聞老車牌鬆至十四元一角及十四元、福新牌十三元七角半、天竹牌十四元、日廠粉雙獅牌十三元六角半、成交約有四五千包、</p>
<p>小麥　昨巿尙稱平定、因粉巿廠盤旣巳增至十三元八角、麥價亦難過於鬆落、且常錫麥跌至二十三元五角後、漸引起某廠之購意、統市售開常州麥十餘車、價為二十三元五角至七角、今後巿情、當根據環境如何為轉移云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　油豆疾降</h3>
<p>雜糧油豆巿塲、因受環境影響、人心　亂異常　辦　依然緊縮、行情一再疾降、</p>
<p>油巿祇　本街吸進大連豆油一百八十桶、價自一百十元直瀉至一百零七元、比上日巿暴跌九元、大有餘廠豆油亦挫跌八元、成交二百八十擔、八十三元、其他一無交易、</p>
<p>黃豆除本街稍有吸收外、間由日商經營之榨油廠採辦、市價較上日價續削六七角至元許、統市計開蕪湖豆八百餘包、價自二十一元六角至十九元六角、南東豆三百包、二十元零八角至二十元、准秋豆一百包、價白二十一元二角、揚州豆一車、二十元零七角、丁家州豆二百包，二十一元五六角、崇明沙黃五十包、二十三元、</p>
<p>雜糧進出口頗旺，十九日自烟台來豆子五百包、二，日豆子運香港八十包，運新加坡六十包、豆餅運厦門五千五百六十塊、生仁運新加坡三十包、生油運香港二百五十聽、</p>
<h3>紗花　大衆套賣四月期　紗市直下　現雙馬跌念元</h3>
<p>紗巿大疲、且跌風殊熾、此因報載歐洲或有和平可能、同時海外印美棉巿下墮、於是人心轉挫、空頭紛紛活動、大衆一致套出四月期、由此檯面頓失鬆懈、立即而下、但大戶多頭因廠方關閉不開、意動鎭靜、不動生色、二十支雙馬四月期價始做九百七十元、跌至九百四十八元、午後又做至九百五十四元、但　銷尙堪維持云、</p>
<p>現紗　開聞英美匯兌放長、啄洲和平空氣濃厚賣方活躍、二十支雙馬本月份價為九百六十元、比上日一跌十元、後以美匯續升、買者不旺、市况愈餒、跌至九百四十八元、中途獲利者扒補、又復回至九百五十三四元、但空方　意堅決、又見下降至九百三十八元、收盤略形回上、至九百四十二元、半日成交二千三百〇五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨價跌二十一元、又棉紗今日有八十件、運往厦門、茲將各帮日買去之額　列左、</p>
<p>香港　五〇五　同行　一·八〇五</p>
<p>統計　二·三〇五</p>
<h3>中外棉價　一致傾疲</h3>
<p>本棉交易較少、此　印美棉轉趨下風、以致人心軟化、巿價稍帶疲乏、但存貨日薄也、蘇北來源、計通花五百八十一包、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市，晨初較為靜寂、後因利物浦帮在市之賣出、及一部份之多顛了結、市况終日沉悶、結果收盤價格、較之上日近期跌二磅音、遠期降落五磅音、印度棉巿因市上盛傳和平之謠、故棉價猛降九雜比餘、然預測稍見回好二羅比、埃及棉巿跌三十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、匯兌稍見放長、然因海外棉市之繼續下降、人心尙虛、故交易毫無起色、同業心意殊為淡薄、廠方不因棉價之低廉而購原棉也、日來交易之展開、恐難有望也、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元半折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白到多續鬆</h3>
<p>昨粗砂白因到貨見增、巿氣挫弱、再度下游、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧六十一元小一元、外棧新到六十一元、小八角、老貨六十元五角至三角、小一元二角、轉　四十八元、小五角、太古車白上檔亦梢帶疲、B嘜西棧六十七元、小一角、東棧六十六元半、小一角、西棧CW嘜六十六元半、CX嘜六十六元、DY嘜六十五元、HX六十四元半、東棧每檔逐退五角、H嘜車赤惟東棧貨小一角、為四十四元七角、荷赤無　動、本綿白小五角、雪白六十一元、本冰降度相同、一號七十三元半、二號七十三元、晶明冰七十五元、國糖叫價如前、無成交、</p>
<h3>南北貨　生仁產價緊</h3>
<p>生仁據靑島通訊、現貨市價見緊、曾以三十七八元由東西洋帮及油坊辦去一萬七千件、花生亦俏、王台生二十六七元、高密生更高至三十二元、辦去二千五百包云、</p>
<h3>五金　馬口鐵價高滯銷</h3>
<p>久趨良佳之馬口鐵巿面、昨各路銷塲均見减少、如本街製罐廠·餅乾公司、及外埠客帮等俱小敢採辦、良由銀根吃緊、且開價又昂、因之生意頓感淸淡、唯售盤受海外定價成本影響、未見如何軟化、如一百八十磅意雙連鐵　箱售一百九十元、一百八十磅美雙連鐵每箱售一百九十五元、二百磅正號美馬口鐵每箱喊二百十元、然祇聞喊價　未見實交也、</p>
<p>黑鐵坯子、昨報載二千磅售八百元、而二百磅售七十八元、（按昨刊為二千磅八百三十元、二百磅八十元、此實誤也）</p>

<p>上海市商會昨奉財政部電云、上海市商會覽、據報、上海入春以來、滙市波動殊大、上海物價暴漲、已超出匯價變動所容許之範圍、米麵漲價特甚、主要原因、為囤戶之操縱等情、亟應設法制止囤積操縱、不惟可以平抑物價、對於穩定滙巿亦有裨益、合電令仰迅行議定有效辦法、切實執行、並電復本部査核為盼、財政部銑渝綫特印、</p>

<p>春秋一年讀書有幾天？  夏鬱奮　　一個學生，假定他終年不生病，不請假，那末，一年中能在敎室裏聽課，有幾天？看了下列的統計，更使我們在學的靑年，知道上課的短少而寳貴，雖然，求學不僅在敎室裏，但視學校爲消遣塲所的公子哥兒們，也該有所警惕吧。　　春假　七天　暑假　六十五天　　年假　三天　寒假　十四天　　紀念假　八天　　以上根據敎育部休假日期規程；而再加以：　　星期日　五十二天　星期六下午合成二十六天　　因爲上海一般學校週末下午沒有課的，即上面幾項，已經一百七十五天，遝要加上許多例外的日子，考試呀，校慶呀，敎師缺課等等，那麼，至少一年中有二百天是不上課的，因爲上面的數字，是至少的數目！一年三百六十五天，只有一百六十五天的日子是上課的，一學期就只有七十七天，二月又十七天！　　終年不缺課的學生，一學期上課的機會，只有二月又十七天，這是多麼可貴的數字啊！　　年靑的同學們！人生是短促的，靑春是寳貴的，求學的機會更是難逢的，二月十七天爲一學期的時間，應該如何的努力，才不負了可貴的學年！春假期中的休閒方法  强弓　　春假快到了，多數學校都從四月一日起開始放春假，大抵該是一個星期的休閒時間。本月三十一日剛好又碰着一個禮拜天，如此接連起來，足足有八個整天的休閒時間了，爲時不算少。　　我料想上海大中小學校數十萬學生，並不是不勸喜春假，而是打算怎樣度過這春假；並不是担憂八個整天的時光太長，而是盼望着用什麼方法一天一天的來休閒這個春假。　　學校會出佈告放春假，而不會出佈告指示春假期中應當怎樣去休閒。這是我不能不借用這點篇幅來遍吿於凡有春假的靑年學子之前的。　　有一句話更要提前說明：就是從前可以有春季「遠足」，而目前只有「近足」；以前頗可利用這段時間去接觸「大自然」，而目前祇得低徊於「小天地」中。事實已經畫好我們春假遊息的圈子，暫時只能忍氣呑聲而就範（此就範乃指脚步的範圍而說）的。　　其次，自然要說到「近足」和「小天地」了，天天躑躅街頭，自覺乏味；天天上公園，也不足寫盡胸中谿壑；跑影院，濁而膩；窺舞池或作牧豬奴戲，尤其我們靑春學子，誰都要不得。　　最後便得開出春假休閒的節目單來：　　且把休閒時間打個對折，意思是說每天作半日休閒，餘半日用來讀書或治事；所謂洽事，便是學習家事，大家可以趁這個空閒時機，把母親手裏的鏟刀接過來做成一碗好小菜，把父親手下的算盤移過來划划收支的賬目，更從書本上讀到過的移到實事求是的事件上來，對樣不對樣，看看那些編書先生究竟有無實學或者是否「閉戶造車」。這一來把一個半日很有意義地度過了，而且生活更要新鮮起來；做人是怎麼一回事，也就從這些地方一點一點體味出來。毫不說誑話的吿訴你。　　讀書求學，原來爲明理與致用，能够這樣利用休閒之期從小處下手，生活實騐固然豐富，不知不覺中要引誘得你勤於翻書實在來得大。從前成功的彥碩或成名的人物，都是從這些小地方鼓勵那個「鍥而不舍」的心一段一段接起來的。　　以上讀書或治事的半天，我要宣吿完卷了。還有半日，那是眞正屬於休閒的了，其實剛剛說過的半日，已經包含有趣的休閒的生活眞義了。能够延長這個半日，固然好；但要換換口味多找一點閒情來散心，亦未嘗不可。　　那末這個半日不妨隨各人所好而分頭進行。譬如我喜歡看足球比賽那末我去我的；你喜歡捉昆蟲或採集小植物，那也去你的。不過八天假期，恐怕不會天天日麗風和，那末又要各各躱進家裏去了。三五友朋，淸歌一曲，亦足怡神；獨奏絲弦，更增心曠。若夫書法競勝，靜物寫生賽像，算算地圖，淸潔的尙有幾縣，寫寫小品，計算我能够感得許多便感許多。　　兩個半日休閒方法，統已開明湊成一日了。方法與支配如此，而休閒的材料，自然會得換新，你且頭一天按照做起來，明天自有明天的一水到渠成」。老虎頭上拍蒼蠅  甘人作「聾啞藝展會」前言  聾啞學生上官琛　　在歐美，在蘇聯，聾人的待遇及聾人團體的組織，在在可獲得政府的扶助，社會的同情，所以絕對不像中國的聾者處處受着家庭的岐視，社會的遺棄，深處在黑暗的一角裏，過着悲慘的命運。　　基督敎靑年會本耶穌精神，以互助互愛的宗旨，在是月十七日成立了「聾啞社」，這可說是上海的創舉，也可說是全國的創舉；它不但給予了孤島上的聾啞羣以偉大的福音，而且進一步的發揚我國聾啞敎育，是値得我們額手稱慶的。　　靑年會聾啞社成立後，它的第一步工作，是徵集聾啞人的創作，如國畫，西畫，工藝，攝影之類，籌開聾啞藝展會。當然它的意義是很重大的，直接地可使社會人士明瞭聾啞的技能，予聾啞的助力自然不在少數；它可發展聾啞天才，給社會一個良好印象，獲得社會的贊賞和同情，使社會不再有擯棄聾啞的心理，予聲啞將來在社會上的便利，這是意料中事，現在用不到多述，靜待將來證實吧現在我們等待着三月二十九日的來臨，欣賞聾啞的藝術天才，願聾啞的朋友們努力！雨過天青  包天笑　　第廿一回　理經綸混合纖維質　興機械佐成文字功　　她們從機器房出來，便走到隔壁的鑄字房來。這鑄字房裏，却有十幾隻鑄字的爐子，還有好些工人，在那裏工作。邵慧華道：『這一點，便是我們中國用漢字的吃虧了。西文只有二十六個字母，而中文至少就有幾千字，單單普通的文字，幾千字也就够了。忽然的來上一篇古文，報館倒不能說因爲我們浚有那種字模，拒絕不登。當然也得雕出字模來，還有新流行的化學界，醫學界，以及一切科學界的新字，總共算來，就得一萬多字。所以中國的鑄字房，就比歐美各國的繁重多了。』吳君素道：『近來廢漢字而通行拉丁新字的運動，不是很盛行嗎？我們快快把它改革起來纔好。』邵慧華道：『這不是十分容易的事。大經改革習慣，比了改革政治還難，而改革文字，比了改革習慣還難。倘然我們的報紙，一旦改了拉丁新字，馬上就沒有人看。從前一篇文章裏，多用一點西文，便有人寫信來說：看報的不是全懂得西文，最好在西文之下，附註譯文，那不是反而累贅嗎？還有最困難的一端，是中國區域太大，方音太多。江蘇人聽廣東話不懂，四川人聽福建話也不懂，有了漢字，倒可以使之統一。倘然聽不懂，同你筆談，寫出來你可就明白了。所以直到如今，漢字老不能廢，池有它的根深蒂固的原因。』瞿無雙笑着說道：『有是有一個法子，只怕還沒有到時候。』吳君素忙問道：『是怎樣的法子？却又說還沒到時候。』瞿無雙道：『那就是使全世界的言語文字統一起來，整個兒的世界，只通一種言語，只用一種文宇。到了那個時候，我們那種古舊的文字，當然不廢而自廢了。我們不能說沒有這一天的日子到來，當然已經有那種趨勢，便是世界語的盛行。即以中國而言，全國的世界語學會，已經不少。不過這件事，不是中國一國所能爲力，要世界各國合力提倡，方能奏效。而且也不是一朝一夕，所能成功呀！正是：　　佉盧縱有旋乾力　倉頡終詡造字功</p>

<p>㳺藝界好萊塢的獸明星  鏞　　好萊塢的製片人爲了增加對於電影觀衆們的興趣，每年　會發掘大批動物明星，把它們搬演於銀幕上。什麼猩猩，猴子，以及一般普通的家畜如貓，犬等，它們在銀幕上的那種有趣的動作，凖可以帮助調劑影片的空氣，所以它們對於電影事業的影響亦不能說小呢。　　爲了這個緣故，凡是好萊塢的動物明星，是有薪金可拿的。就是牠的主人，甚至訓練者；亦另有一種報酬。勃席（Buzzy）是一　獵犬，曾在李思廉霍華主演的“Escape　to　Happiness”一片中串演，當時規定　日工作，薪金爲　十五元，連加七元半給牠的訓練。阿斯脫（Asta）亦是一頭獵犬，牠在威廉鮑惠爾及茂娜洛埃合演的（大偵探聶克」“Thin　Man”中擔任着主角的地位，　此牠的薪金是更大了。至於牛，猪等，因爲牠們在銀幕上大都是合羣演出，所以牠們的報酬比較低，是按日五元或四元。當然，像這種待遇，有時我們人類還不能擭得呢。所以，每年總有成千成萬所謂動物的主人，想把他們所養的心愛的動物送到好萊塢去。　　考爾斯（Harold　Coles），是柴紐克攝影塲上的管理道具者，他能够領略任何種動物有沒有上銀幕的可能，他曾經這樣說：「最重要的條件，是要看牠們的祖系，是否聰穎，舉動活潑。其次就是牠本身能不能受人指揮。總而言之，與我們想上銀幕的條件是不同的。」獲得「金像獎」的明星  燕　　美國電影藝術學院舉辦的一年一度一金像獎，自創始迄今，已經十二年了，在這十二年裏的每年獲得這種「藝術金像獎」的最優秀的兩位明星，他的芳名是誰？現在讓我寫在下面吧。　　一九二八年：獲獎的男明星是伊密爾詹寗斯；女明星是珍妮蓋諾。　　一九二九年：獲獎的男明星是華納裴士德；女明星是曼麗　克馥。　　一九三〇年：獲獎的男明星是喬治亞理斯；女明星是瑙瑪希拉。　　一九三一年：獲獎的男明昨是里昂巴理穆亞；女明星是曼　特蘭漱。　　一九三二年：獲獎的男明星是茀拉立馬區：女明星是海綸漢絲。　　一九三三年：遂獎的男明星是却爾斯勞頓；女明星是凱絲玲赫本。　　一九三四年：獲獎的男明星是克拉尅蓋博；女明星是克勞黛考爾白。　　一九三五年：獲獎的男明星是難多麥克勞倫；女明星是蓓蒂黛維絲。　　一九三六年：獲獎的男明星是保羅茂尼；女明星是露薏絲蕾娜。　　一九三七年：獲獎的男明星是史本山屈萊賽；女明星是露薏絲蕾娜。　　一九三八年：獲獎的男明星是史本山屈萊賽；女明星是蓓　黛維絲。　　一九三九年：獲獎的男女兩明星，尙在評選中，大約在本月底可揭曉了。　　一九四〇年：獎的男女兩明星，則要請各影迷們預先猜測了。　　我們看了上述的名單，就可以知道好萊塢每年技術表演最佳最優秀的演員了。「三兄弟」　將搬上銀幕  秋雯　　在華日本人民反戰同盟西南支部，最近在廣西桂林公演之日語劇「三兄弟」因全劇對日本軍閥壓迫日本人民之痛苦生活及反戰情緒，描寫極為透澈，業經西南行營白主任崇　之建議，決將該劇攝成影片，俾國內外同胞對於日軍侵略戰爭之醜態，原形畢露，益深同仇敵愾之心云。金獎鉅片　萬世師表  敏　　「萬世師表是一九三九年十大名片的冠軍。主演過「基度山恩仇記」的勞勃杜奈，造成了此片最高的榮譽。他的演技精湛，似乎有着神的魔力，從少年而中年，轉到老年的生活，無論聲容形態，都有顯著的變化。在一般人看來，或許以爲是兩個人扮演的，可見他化妝術的高妙與表情的神化。　　無疑地，這部片在敎育立塲上，有着甚高的成就。它不但說明一個人，獻給敎育事業，應該爲敎育而敎育，尤其在抗戰意志上，它也有堅決的把握，無論是空襲或轟炸，炸不死這位老敎授的精神，他爲國家培育英才，爲抗戰保存元氣。　　女主角是葛麗亞嘉蓀，她是英國有名的　伶，還是第一次上鏡頭。她在「萬世師表」中的演出，雖然時間不很多，可是演技的優美，獲取了電影圈內外觀衆崇高的　美，就是米高梅當局，也給予非常的重視。寫「萬世師表」說部的著作家詹姆斯赫　頓，以四大功夫，寫出這部轟動全世界的作品，眞是著作界的一個怪傑。　　這部片定明天在大華獻映，料必轟動一時呢。勞勃杜奈化裝老年時讀「影星减瘦法」後  娟　　王引說胡蝶的「减瘦法」是不進含有脂肪性的食品，　飯米之類　只一　。使得我想起了關於胖　瘦的話。　　有些我每每喜歡「胖」，有些人每每喜歡「瘦」，這都不是正確的見解。「胖」不是健康的表示，「瘦」也不是健康的表示。「胖」是脂肪太多，而「瘦」則是脂肪太少，脂肪對於人是需要的，也是必要的，有了脂肪，才可以調節體溫。但是太多了是不鍵康的，太少了也是不健康的。胖子說我多胖呵，好不得意。瘦子說我多瘦得有骨　呵，也很神氣。科學地說來，都是自詡而已。脂肪太多了，人會不　。容易「中風」。脂肪太少了，人也不靈，寒酸地一　。偶而一病，不進飲食，說不定就不能支持！因此胖子必須設法减瘦，同時，瘦子也須設法加胖。使一個人有足够消耗及調節體溫的脂肪。像胡蝶的辦法、我可不敢贊同，我認爲後面的辦法。很可以供給胖了想瘦些的人們參考。　　每日按時的吃食鹽白　水，或者就以食鹽白開水代一切飲料也好。食品方面可以少吃些多脂肪的物品，如肥肉，生猪油　。多吃些蔬菜水菓等。其他不必忌，肥减瘦的最重要關鍵是運動。我有一個朋友，他做的　非常舒服，坐了包車去辦公，坐坐而已，大魚大肉，再沒心思想，沒有三年，肥得不得了。血壓高得要中風，三個月前才注意飲食，如我的話，又將包車夫改充男僕，自已每天跑到辦公處，一切以兩隻腿爲交通工具。現在，已减輕體重二十五磅，的確，看出了淸瘦。他說精神好極了，比從前好。睡眠安靜異常。沒有公辦的時候就踱，踱着，坐着，自己也奇怪，居然可以减了體重！　　我雖然說出了我的關於肥减瘦的話，但是不贊成人人一亂一减瘦！所謂「　」者，就是只管自己的審美觀念。其實一個鍵美的人決不是瘦得骨如柴的。瘦的人我非常希望他和她設法加胖！但是胖的人，非胖到不健康的　度決不可以减瘦防癆播音大會串剪影  星谷　　昨天下午　時，防癆宣傳的播音在新都飯店開幕，各名伶名票影星全體參加，極一進之盛。　　防癆會的發起，各界名流能加頗多，如　康侯丁福保何五良等，　實際主持的寳為　橋療養院丁惠康君，這次播音中，各界仕女熱心捐款，爲數極鉅，尤以林之福章汝發邀請名票江一秋君唱平劇捐款三千元，洵属難得。　　關於節目的演出，均屬一時名作，石人望的日琴和石海倫小姐的手風琴是極難能可貴的，由「大衆口琴會」會員合奏，林樹森·楊瑞亭·雪又琴的平劇，獲得相當彩聲，會中除保人醫師的講演防癆常識以外，節目從三時半一直播至深夜十二時止。照例是有許多影迷們包圍了男女影星簽名，這使到新都來的影星們不得不引爲畏事，這次到的影星狠多，特別以紫微，寗萓，周曼華，鳳凰更受注意，紫寗二人穿了古裝播唱「刺秦王」的新曲，許多攝影記者特爲她拍了不少照片　　這次成績不壞，據說爲　節開支，玻璃電台是山李洋君免費借給的。可憐的難童  成　　難民協會同鄕組　委會主辦之游藝救難大會，昨日舉行兒童鍵康比賽時，由天籟兒童劇藝社，派十餘　眞劇漫的兒童，來表演游藝，以助餘興，除歌曲舞蹈外，內有一齣話劇，曰「可憐的難童」，出塲由兩個難童，扶持其病危之母，睡於道旁，無衣無食，乃母不久氣絕，二童將屍遮蔽，沿途乞食，至一富戶門口，向看門者素冷粥冷飯，閽人大聲呼斥，爲小姐所聞，外出察看，憐其苦楚，飭覔殘羹，　人以近來米價昂貴，家內所畜之貓狗，太太尙嫌　大而有煩言，勸其不必預聞此事。小姐往詢其母，母至門前，親詢難童流落情形，經姊弟二人，詳述家世，家庭被炸彈所燬，其父殉難，母又憂憤成疾，病死道旁。言時涕淚交流，結果衆人大爲感動，除給以殘羹冷飯以果腹外，由富戶捐款至難民兒童敎養院，令　人携此難童送院留养。是劇可歌可泣，觀衆被　淚珠不少云。壺齊曲話  蘇少卿　　反二簧與反西陂　　彼　曲唱法，有南北合套，犯調，集曲，唐宋大樂有人破，出破，之法。二簧之有反二簧，西陂之有反西陂，反西陂之必復回正西陂，皆前輩審音知律之伶工，利用崑曲大樂慣例以造成新聲者也。今之樂猶古之樂，於此益信。反二簧與反西陂，皆主悲哀，已如前述，惟各劇哀情之分際，因劇中人之身分遭遇而不同；若碰碑之楊令公，與烏盆計之劉世昌，皆唱反二簧，慢板三眼原板，而其悲哀情緒之表現，應各有其特徵異點，不可換湯不換講，哀情不足，固非好手，不能恰到好處；各如其分，亦非良材也。因一爲白髯末角，一爲黑髯生角，一爲塞外孤獨之老將，一爲三年沉寃之死鬼也。舉此類推，不必費辭，宋元以來之曲家，說云，「唱最重曲情」，唱「南呂宮宜感嘆傷悲，高調宜悽愴怨慕，角調宜嗚咽悠揚」，今之反二簧反西陂，即古之南呂商調角調之意也。雖然，唱此種調，不可不悲，又不可過悲，詩序云，「哀而不傷」，最是要言，若承一向柔弱唱風，一味痛哭，而無口勁氣力以貫串之，此謂「靡靡之音」「杞梁妻哭夫之音」亦無當於眞正劇藝也。（下）</p>

<h3>The Ling Shan Area Engaged in Six Days and Nights of Fierce Battles; the Japanese Were Surrounded and in Dire Straits; A Unit of Japanese Troops Broke Through and Retreated Southwest; No Trace of the Japanese at Suwei, Langwei, Naqi, Tanbai, and Other Places</h3>
<p>Binyang: The Japanese troops invading Ling Shan via the Yue-Nan Road suffered extraordinarily heavy casualties under successive attacks by the Chinese army. On the evening of the 18th, the main force of the Japanese army was still surrounded by the Chinese army in the mountainous area around the Liulu Mountain area between Ling Shan and Luwu. The Japanese forces were in dire straits. The Chinese army launched a fierce and irresistible attack, decimating the enemy. As of noon on the 19th, the encirclement and annihilation continued. Another Japanese force broke through the encirclement and fled southwest towards Hengxian. After being pursued and attacked by the Chinese army, finding no way to advance, they retreated southwest on the morning of the 19th. At the same time, a unit of Japanese troops was driven by the Chinese forces to Fozi'ao, east of Ling Shan, and is currently being fiercely attacked by the Chinese army. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: The Japanese troops who invaded Ling Shan in separate groups from the Yong-Qin Road were subjected to fierce attacks by the Chinese army in Xinping, Luwu, Tiger Mountain, Kanniu Ping, Nanyang Township, Sanzhou, and other places. After six days and nights of fierce battles, countless Japanese soldiers were killed. On the afternoon of the 18th, the Japanese reached the western side of the Ling Shan area. The Chinese army pursued them from all directions, cutting off the Japanese retreat. The encirclement is now complete, and the annihilation of the main force of the Japanese army is imminent. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guinan Front: The Japanese troops invading Ling Shan were attacked by Chinese forces. One unit reached Foziwei, where the Chinese are currently launching a fierce attack. The Japanese troops who were blocked by the Chinese army in the Shapiwei area also reached Nanxiang, northeast of Shapi. The Chinese army split up to intercept them, leaving the Japanese with no way to go. On the 19th, they retreated southwest. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Binyang: The Japanese at Datang are still being surrounded and annihilated by the Chinese forces. One unit has already broken through and fled. On the 16th, the Chinese army launched another mopping-up operation near Nazhi Village, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops collapsed and fled. The Chinese army recovered a large number of farm cattle. Shiertan was recaptured again. On the morning of the 18th, the Japanese sent reinforcements to counterattack. Fierce battles continued until late at night. On the 13th, the Japanese troops who arrived at Suwei from Wuwu were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army. The Japanese could not withstand the attack and collapsed in retreat. Currently, there is no trace of the Japanese at Suwei, Langwei, Naqi, Tanbai, and other places. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese telegram received here today from the Guinan Front, on the night of the 17th, the Japanese army divided into three routes, encircling Ling Shan, east of the Yong-Qin Highway, from the northwest, west, and southeast. They infiltrated the suburbs and invaded the city at noon yesterday. The Chinese army, concentrated in the suburbs, began a counteroffensive yesterday morning and dispatched elite troops to attack the rear of the Japanese army on the highway. Fierce battles are currently taking place in the Ling Shan area. The Chinese army is rapidly closing in on the Japanese troops. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingning: The Japanese troops in Anbu, Shantou, began to be active again on the morning of the 18th, harassing Chenghai. The Chinese army took advantage of the heavy rain to launch a vigorous assault, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese in a battle in the Donghu Township area on the outskirts of Chenghai. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Japanese troops on Hainan Island have recently repeatedly sent reinforcements to harass various places. Japanese warships are also gathered in large numbers on the sea, and have been carrying out large-scale bombings with aircraft for days, causing numerous civilian casualties. Fierce battles are currently underway with the Chinese army. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news here today, the Japanese troops in the Nanning-Qinzhou area have already expanded their area of operations. The area of operations of the Japanese troops in this area has formed a long rectangular pocket shape. The Longmen Port in Qinzhou Bay happens to be the exit of this pocket. The highway from northeast of Nanning to Binyang, the area where the war has become a tug-of-war, is the northern end of this pocket. The Ling Shan and upper reaches of the Qin River area constitute the eastern end of this pocket. The area near Shangsi, on the western side of the Yong-Qin Highway, is the western side of this pocket. The area within this rectangular area totals 360 square miles. A considerable number of Chinese guerrillas have infiltrated it to sabotage communications and transportation. The reason why the Japanese are extending eastward to Ling Shan and westward to Shangsi is clearly to attempt to control both sides of the Yong-Qin Highway, thereby protecting their lines of communication. The recent Japanese attack on Ling Shan took the route through Yongchun, which may be preparation for another attack on Binyang. (19th United Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>President and Vice President of the Executive Yuan Host Banquet for Representatives to National Education Conference; President Jiang's Instructions: Attention Should Be Paid to Restoring Ancient Chinese Educational Methods to Make Students Understand the Principles of Being Human and Develop Virtues</h3>
<p>Chongqing: At 6:30 PM on the 19th, President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and Vice President Kong hosted a public banquet at the Yuan for representatives to the National Education Conference, and invited Wei Daoming, Chen Lifu, Jiang Tingfu, and senior officials from various departments of the Executive Yuan to accompany them. Over 70 people attended, including education directors and representatives from various provinces. During the banquet, President Jiang gave instructions, the general idea of which was that the purpose and all educational principles of our country have a consistent spirit. My personal opinions on education are the same as what I said at the National Education Conference last year. However, today's education, especially the fundamental national education, should pay special attention to restoring the ancient Chinese educational methods: rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic, to arm education. Our China, because of the past education, the education of the past two or three decades, everyone has not paid attention to this, so our spirit is not good, our physical strength is not good, and the general people are so poor, weak, stupid, and therefore the country has suffered such shame. Japan, on the other hand, has been able to absorb our ancient educational methods, so their people are physically stronger than us. Since the war of resistance, it has provided us with a good opportunity to avoid the environment of the large cities along the river and coast and go to the interior, naturally giving us the opportunity to restore ancient educational methods and arm education. If our education circles, responsible people, educators, and teachers cannot take this opportunity to correct previous mistakes and give full play to the effectiveness of education, they are truly the sinners of the nation. Secondly, in the future, in addition to science, students in schools must understand the principles of being human, and must be close to daily life. Zeng Wenzhenggong educated his children with eight characters, which included all daily life. Our students today must work hard on this. Every school should follow this principle, and do what they can according to the environment and objective situation, and pay special attention to loving animals and plants, and not allow animal abuse or the destruction of trees. This should be written in the national education textbook to cultivate students' virtues of benevolence and cherishing things. In short, the past education was a harmful education. If today's education does not bring students closer to daily life and teach students the skills of rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic, everyone will be sinners of the country and nation. These are a few words I have added to my previous speech. I respectfully offer everyone a glass of wine and wish you good health. (19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Also Holds Tea Party to Express Appreciation</h3>

Chen also gave a detailed explanation of the Ministry of Education's efforts to promote music education in recent years, and said that rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic are the spirit of our country's founding. Today, if we want to revitalize the atmosphere of despondency, decadence, depression, and disorganization, there is no other way than to restore music education. I sincerely hope that all representatives will pay attention to this. After the speech, he invited Ying Shangneng, Cai Shaoxu, Lu Xutang, and Dai Cuilun to perform music. The performances were extremely wonderful. Tea and snacks were then served, and the guests freely chatted during the banquet. The atmosphere was extremely harmonious, and the party did not end until dusk. (19th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>International Brewing and Its Destination</h3>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler met in a train carriage at the Brenner Pass on the Italian border the day before yesterday, the 18th, for a two-and-a-half-hour discussion. The main topic of discussion must have been the international situation, and the impact of the discussion must have concerned the future of peace and war. How will international peace and war unfold? The distinction between good and bad fortune, and our opportunity, are truly tied to this. However, the world's attention was focused on this, but what was seen and heard afterward was merely that the Italian Prime Minister had a beaming smile and the German Führer was self-possessed; nothing else was known. Can this be blamed on our lack of access? We firmly believe that apart from the three or five people involved in the confidential matter, no one else can know. One should not try to catch shadows from their expressions and claim that something was revealed. Even if many speculations and propaganda prove to be somewhat accurate in the future, they are ultimately not a realistic and accurate report.</p>
<p>Even considering the various speculations and propaganda, there are two prevalent theories: One is that the two leaders are urgently seeking to stabilize Eastern Europe and the Balkans; the other is that Italy and Germany will invite the Soviet Union to jointly launch a peace offensive. According to the former theory, Germany is also wary of the Soviet Union; according to the latter theory, Italy is now willing to be on friendly terms with the Soviet Union. These two theories are contradictory, and at least one must be false. We suspect they are both false. Leaving aside other arguments, Italy is determined to maintain the balance of power in the Balkans and Eastern Europe, and especially wants to adjust, harmonize, and improve it. It absolutely does not want to see it reorganized or dominated. In other words, the way to stabilize it, in Italy's view, is that Germany or Germany and the Soviet Union should take no action, and it is certainly not for Germany to make Italy take any action. Italy's attitude has been consistent and increasingly clear. If this were not the case, when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited the Italian capital last week, he would have known Italy's attitude. Why would the German Führer bother to personally visit a neighboring country to try to push this? Italy's attitude toward the Soviet Union is offensive in its ideology and defensive in its actions. If Germany can mediate between them, it would be the ultimate act of mediation. If it were to rope in Italy and the Soviet Union, it would not only defy Italy's ideology but would also make it abandon America, cut off England and France, and leave its comfortable seat to enter fire and water. Leaving aside the fact that Italy would not take this action, Germany would not even consider it. Even if Germany thought of it, it is not something that the German Führer would want to personally try lightly. Therefore, the lack of credibility of these two theories can be understood simply by observing Italy's attitude.</p>
<p>Observing the recent international situation, it is currently in the midst of much brewing. The direction of this brewing is to resolve difficulties and disputes, so it must brew failure and despair before it tends toward deterioration; otherwise, given time and human effort, a sudden opening can be expected. If we make a bold interpretation, then the success of the Finnish-Soviet peace is because the Soviet Union, in light of the international brewing, seized the opportunity first, abandoning its highest desire to attack Finland and sacrificing its greatest possibility to control Finland, in order to secure its gains from Finland before the international brewing became clear. This is truly a brilliant and ancient strategic art in politics and diplomacy; Japan is not worthy to discuss this. We truly cannot confirm the detailed content of the international brewing. Let us try to gather some clues: Before US Under Secretary of State Welles was ordered to visit Italy, Germany, England, and France, it was frequently reported that the American and Soviet envoys in Washington and Moscow were in frequent contact with the authorities of their respective host countries. The content of the contact was kept secret by both sides. Various different inferences can of course be made from this, but it can be imagined that the distance between the views of the two countries, whether far or near, does not prevent them from understanding each other. Although both the US President and Secretary of State claim that Welles is not on a mission to take positive action, the fact that he traveled and the US President immediately went sailing on the sea shows how deeply and urgently they are looking forward to Welles' mission. Welles did not disgrace his mission, so after going to Italy and Germany, the Italian and German leaders found it necessary to meet, and Welles found it necessary to stay temporarily in Rome after going from England and France. Observing Welles' reactions in Rome and Berlin first, and then in Paris and London, it is clear that Italy and Germany are strong while England and France are submissive. In our opinion, America sympathizes with England and France but does not fully favor them. England and France feel America's sympathy but regret that they have not seen America keep pace with them. American and German views must be different, but there is room for revision in Germany's proposals. Italy, which is said to be between England and France and Germany, is actually between Germany and America. When Finland and the Soviet Union were at war, Germany sided with the Soviet Union and suppressed Finland, hoping that Finland and the Soviet Union would cease hostilities and that the Soviet Union would help Germany even more. But after Finland and the Soviet Union reconciled, no German dignitaries were seen rushing to Moscow, but only the Foreign Minister and the Führer visited Italy one after another. Is this not proof that the pursuit of profit is more urgent than preparing for war? Summarizing these various signs, it would be better to say that what is brewing internationally is to resolve difficulties and disputes, rather than to say that it is full of conspiracies and intrigues. In this brewing, Soviet-Japanese negotiations are said to have failed, and US-China loans are said to have succeeded, because only Japan is outside the circle of brewing. Now that Finland and the Soviet Union have made peace, the European war has not reached its peak but seems to be heading rapidly downstream. Japan is gradually becoming a target, returning home defeated is not far off, we can wait and see.</p>
<h3>Ambassador to the Soviet Union Yang Jie Arrives in Chongqing from Yunnan; Yang Talks: The Soviet-Finnish Peace Was a Victory for Soviet Diplomacy; Japan's Position Will Become Increasingly Isolated</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Ambassador to the Soviet Union Yang Jie returned home to report on his duties. After arriving in Kunming at the beginning of the month, he flew from Kunming to Chongqing at 3:30 PM on the 19th. Many heads of agencies went to welcome him.

<p>Kunming: Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Yang Jie flew to Chongqing today. According to Yang's remarks to reporters last night, the Soviet-Finnish peace was a victory for Soviet diplomacy. The significance of this victory is actually far greater than its military victory. As for Japan, due to the end of the Soviet-Finnish war and the inability to continue the Franco-Japanese commercial treaty, its position will become increasingly isolated. According to Yang, when he passed through Hanoi, Annam, he heard that there were many Japanese spies in the hotels in Hanoi. When talking about Yunnan, Yang said that since the coast was blockaded by the Japanese, Yunnan has become China's international lifeline, so China's victory is closely related to this international lifeline. Before leaving here, Yang Jie also visited Long Yun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government. (19th United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Debt Owed by China Can Be Repaid Soon</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to sources familiar with current affairs, the 25 million US dollars that the United States lent to China in 1938 will be completely repaid by next spring. According to the original agreement, the loan was to be repaid within five years, but due to the recent increase in tung oil exports, it will be repaid by next spring. It is reported that most of the tung oil that has been exported this year has been shipped to the United States. Those that have already been shipped out have reached 70,000 tons. Currently, the Chinese government employs 20,000 workers and 12,000 mules and donkeys to engage in transportation. As for tea exports, the Soviet Union ranks first, while tung oil ranks second.

<h3>Resolution of the Tianjin Concession Blockade Hopeless</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Today, at a reception for newspaper reporters, a Japanese military spokesperson, when answering a question about when the Japanese side would lift the blockade of the Tianjin Concession, expressed his personal opinion that only after Japan, Italy, and other foreign powers return their concessions in China will Japan have any signs of lifting the blockade of the Tianjin Concession. The spokesperson also mentioned the Tianjin silver issue, saying that this matter cannot be resolved before the establishment of the "New Regime" led by Wang Jingwei. This issue will be one of the first issues raised after the establishment of the "New Central Government". According to the interpreter's supplement to the above remarks, the silver issue will be a supporting factor for resolving the blockade issue, but the final resolution of the blockade issue is feared to have no hope of success before a satisfactory decision is made on the return of the concessions.

<h3>Anti-War Movement Expands in Hualien Port, Taiwan, and Other Places; Punished Officers and Soldiers Secretly Organize Groups; Many Respond, Japanese Military Authorities Embarrassed</h3>
<p>Hong Kong. Keelung News: In Hualien Port, Pingtung, Hsinchu Prefecture, Taichung, Kaohsiung, and other places in Taiwan, many anti-war officers and soldiers who have been escorted from various places in China are being incorporated into punishment teams to be punished. These anti-war officers and soldiers secretly organized groups, using "Rather face military law sanctions than be willing to be transferred to China to fight" as their slogan. Japanese troops in various places have responded one after another. Upon hearing this news, the Japanese military authorities, fearing the expansion of the situation, urgently dispatched a large number of military police to arrest all the leading anti-war soldiers in Hualien Port. However, after unanimous requests from Japanese troops in various places to release them, the Japanese military authorities were unable to do so and urgently issued a notice to dispel rumors, forcefully saying that there was no anti-war movement in Hualien Port. However, with the facts in place, the Japanese military is still actively expanding the anti-war organization. The Japanese military authorities are extremely embarrassed by this. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mission of Japanese "Envoy" Abe to China: To Sign a New Treaty of Relations with Wang, Seizing China's Independence and Freedom</h3>
<p>Tokyo. According to Japanese sources, Abe, Japan's newly appointed "envoy," will have full authority to adjust new relations based on the foundation agreed upon by Jingwei and the Japanese authorities in China last December, and to negotiate a treaty on new relations after the establishment of the Wang regime. This treaty contains concise clauses clarifying the joint responsibilities and missions of China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" to achieve the goals of the Konoe Declaration. This will become the highest principle of Sino-Japanese relations. It is noted that the Konoe Declaration has been approved by the Japanese Emperor and cannot be changed. The basic principles of the declaration require China to (1) establish full diplomatic relations with "Manchukuo"; (2) conclude an anti-communist treaty consistent with the Anti-Comintern Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy; (3) recognize the stationing of Japanese troops in designated locations in China as an anti-communist measure; (4) designate Inner Mongolia as a special anti-communist zone; (5) recognize the freedom of Japanese to reside and trade in the Chinese interior; and (6) grant Japan the convenience of developing China, especially the natural resources of North China and Inner Mongolia. After this is signed, it will be announced simultaneously by both China and Japan in the form of a joint declaration.

<h3>Indians Demand Complete Independence</h3>
<p>Longar. The Proposal Review Committee of the Indian National Congress passed a resolution yesterday by an overwhelming majority, demanding complete independence for India and rejecting the status of a dominion as a solution to this issue. There were suspicions that Gandhi was preparing to compromise with Britain on India's future. Gandhi replied that if necessary, he would visit India, even fifty times, and would not be bothered. If members of the All-India Congress could eliminate the shortcomings of lack of discipline and the spirit of rebellion, he would begin the struggle within a month. However, he has not yet seen any signs that they are ready to fight immediately. (18th Dispatch from Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome. All-India Congress President Asad, on the eve of the opening of the All-India Congress yesterday, told reporters from the Italian press, "Since the outbreak of the European war, India has repeatedly asked Britain to declare its war aims, whether Britain is truly fighting for democracy, whether it is fighting to protect the freedom of all countries (including India), and whether Britain is preparing to recognize the right of the Indian nation to self-determination, especially to have an independent constitution, which will allow it to decide its attitude towards participating in the war. Britain's response to the above questions is that Britain is fighting for the freedom of Europe and is not prepared to allow India's independence." Asad continued, "If India, with one-fifth of the human population, is denied its constitutional rights, it is tantamount to being fooled, which India cannot tolerate. It is determined to solve its own problems, that is, the constitutional issue. In this regard, the All-India Congress demands the organization of an election congress so that the Muslim people can also participate in the elections. It should be known that the Muslim people are not opposed to India's independence. It was decided that when the European war ended, Britain would promise to resolve the Indian issue in a humane way, but for twenty-two years, India has been struggling for sovereignty. The opening of this All-India Congress is the highest point of India's struggle for independence." (19th Dispatch from Haitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>Interpellation on Diplomacy with Britain: A Disturbance in the Japanese House of Representatives; Members Wave Fists, Stomp Feet, and Scold Arita; Intervention by the Guard Causes Conflict</h3>
<p>Tokyo. A major disturbance occurred in the Japanese House of Representatives today. This disturbance was due to a question raised by a member to Foreign Minister Arita. According to the questioner, Arita's handling of the Asama Maru incident was completely inappropriate. Because of his inappropriateness, Britain did not express any apology for this incident and required Japan to prohibit the transport of people of military age from belligerent countries. As a result, various countries recognized that Japan had become weak, and the United States even continued to lend 20 million US dollars to Chongqing. Britain and France also proceeded to intercept mail on Japanese ships. Foreign Minister Arita did not answer this question. Therefore, members of the Social Masses Party and the Dokuritsu-sha (transliteration) expressed indignation, waved their fists and moved forward to the podium, stomped their feet, struck the table, and scolded loudly, shouting that Arita was a "coward" and the "Foreign Minister of Britain." Some members even wailed loudly. According to eyewitnesses, this disturbance was the first of its kind in recent years. Speaker Koyama, in order to maintain order, ordered one of the members who was the most turbulent to be ejected from the Diet. However, the Speaker's actions only made the order even more chaotic, as some members even clashed with the guards. Therefore, Koyama announced a recess, and the situation did not escalate. When the Diet reconvened at 5:20 p.m., Arita stated that the British government's note to the Japanese government on January 27 clearly indicated an apology. However, there were shouts of "Lies!" and "Lies!" from the seats. At the same time, the questioner also expressed dissatisfaction with Arita's answer and planned to raise it again at another time.

<h3>Japan Plans to Abolish the Sea Otter Hunting Agreement</h3>
<p>Tokyo. According to Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's statement in the Diet, Japan is now planning to abolish the sea otter hunting agreement previously concluded with the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union. According to the agreement, sea otters on islands north of 30 degrees north latitude in the Pacific Ocean are not allowed to be hunted in order to allow them to breed and multiply. However, according to Arita, the number of sea otters on islands north of 30 degrees north latitude has now increased to 830,000, which has become a threat to fisheries in the North Pacific. Therefore, Japan is now planning to abolish the agreement so that a new agreement can be concluded. (Associated Press 19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Various Pending Issues between the Soviet Union and Japan Have Made No Progress; Adjustment of Relations between the Two Countries is Difficult; Conclusion of a Non-Aggression Pact is Even More Absurd</h3>
<p>Hong Kong. Tokyo News: The English-language Japan Times recently conducted a general review of Soviet-Japanese relations. According to reports, at the beginning of this year, there was hope for the resolution of some pending issues between the Soviet Union and Japan. However, the results of the discussions between the two sides were far from what was expected, and as of today, no progress has been made. On the 11th of this month, the Paris Labor News reported that the Soviet Union and Japan were conducting negotiations to conclude a non-aggression pact and that negotiations to stop Soviet aid to China's war of resistance were all nonsense. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The English-language "Japan Times" commented today, expressing deep doubts about the possibility of a rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Japan. The "Times," which usually represents the views of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, stated that although Japan and the Soviet Union have intensified negotiations in the past six months, the main problems between the two countries have not only not been resolved, but there is currently no hope for a peaceful solution. The newspaper further stated that a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan "undoubtedly cannot become an issue," because the current relationship between the two countries makes it so. In reviewing Japan's efforts to resolve various issues between the two countries and the Soviet Union, the newspaper stated that the results were "far from what was expected." The newspaper indicated, "Commercial negotiations have made no progress. The joint committee formed by Japan's 'Manchukuo' and the Soviet Union's 'Outer Mongolia' to resolve the issue of the Khalkha demarcation line has yielded no results. The committee ended its work at the end of January. All border issues have not been resolved. Regarding the demarcation line between the Soviet Union and 'Manchukuo,' the two sides have agreed in principle to organize a committee to conduct negotiations. In addition, the two sides have not made further contacts." The newspaper observed that there currently "seems to be a deliberate plan to place a spoke in the wheel of Japanese diplomacy, causing it to stall." Furthermore, Japan has not sought to conclude a non-aggression pact during its negotiations with the Soviet Union. The newspaper concluded that, from the Japanese point of view, resolving the pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union is a condition for adjusting the overall diplomatic problems between the two countries.

<h3>News from New York: German Peace Plan; Content Includes Eleven Clauses; The Pope Denies Acting as Intermediary</h3>

<p>Rome. Official sources here today refuted the rumors that when the two major figures of Germany and Italy met at the Brenner Pass yesterday, Hitler had proposed eleven kinds of peace terms. Also, according to Gaida in the "Italian Daily," the Italian Prime Minister is not an envoy of peace, and in fact, no government has proposed peace terms, so it is expected that the period of war will continue and intensify. (Associated Press 19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>London. A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that responsible sources in London declared today that they were completely unaware of any peace plan as disclosed by various newspapers in New York. According to the information obtained in London, they are not prepared to announce or propose any such plan under any circumstances. (Reuters 19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome. According to a senior Vatican official last night, when Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Chancellor Hitler unexpectedly met at the Brenner Pass yesterday, they asked Hitler to postpone the "major offensive" and requested that some concessions be made to the eleven compromise peace proposals put forward by the German side. It is said that U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles felt that the German proposal was unacceptable. In fact, both London and Paris ridiculed the German proposal. The Vatican said that after the meeting between the German and Italian leaders, the German side might make further concessions. The eleven proposals put forward by Germany should not be regarded as "merely probing opinions," but need to be carefully managed in the future. Therefore, Mussolini, after learning from Welles about Hitler's proposals, which would inevitably lead to failure unless quick concessions were made, held the Brenner Pass meeting. Welles asked Mussolini to immediately report to Hitler that his proposals could not be accepted by the Allied countries and that further concessions had to be made if the peace movement was to succeed. As for whether Mussolini was able to obtain concessions from Hitler, both Germany and Italy remained tight-lipped last night. However, judging from Mussolini's joyful expression when he appeared on the special train and Hitler's stern and contemplative attitude, it was generally speculated that Mussolini had achieved some success. The Vatican said that the content of the eleven peace proposals submitted by Hitler to Welles is as follows: (1) Adopt universal and simultaneous disarmament measures for the army, navy, and air force. (2) Organize a small independent Polish state in the Warsaw area of central Poland, with a population of about one million or one million and one hundred thousand, and open the port of Gdynia to Poland, so that the country can have access to the Baltic Sea. Poland will also have the Free City of Danzig to facilitate Polish commerce with the Baltic Sea. The boundaries of the small Polish state will be determined by a referendum under the supervision of an international committee. The issue of ethnic minorities in the Danube River and Polish regions will be resolved by group immigration. (3) The Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary will form a three-nation alliance with Germany. Within that, Germany will enjoy certain industrial and transportation rights for twenty-five years. (4) Austria will always belong to Germany. (5) Germany will recover its colonies within twenty-five years, or at least certain colonial rights, or protect German immigrants to certain areas of Africa. (6) Organize the Danube River Group, guided by Germany and Italy. The group includes Yugoslavia, Albania, Bohemia, and Slovakia. (7) The Balkan status quo will remain, protecting the Bessarabian and Transylvanian borders of Romania. (8) Complete religious freedom. Under British guidance, a small number of Jews in Germany will be led to Palestine, Italian East Africa, and French Madagascar. (9) Complete freedom of trade after the war, with no tariff barriers to raw materials, economic cooperation with the United States, and facilitating immigration for both Germany and Italy, such as Italians moving to Tunisia and Germans moving to Africa. (10) Italy will receive special treatment in Djibouti's commerce, and from 1945, Italy will be granted the right to pass through the Suez Canal from Italy. (11) Italy will gain a new status in Tunisia. The last two points indicate the cooperation of the Axis powers, making Italy feel satisfied. (Associated Press 19th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Welles Scheduled to Leave Europe for the United States Today; Mission is to Collect Intelligence; Did Not Participate in Any Negotiations</h3>
<p>Rome. After U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles met with the Pope this morning, the Pope sent Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Maglione to return the visit. Welles then met with U.S. Ambassador Phillips and attended a banquet hosted by Prince Colonna, Governor of Rome, in the evening. It is reported that Welles has drafted a report on the details of the audience with the Pope and is scheduled to depart for Genoa late tomorrow to board the "Conte di Savoia" for his return to the United States on the 20th. (Havas 18th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington. After U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles arrived in Rome for the second time, he stayed for many days without starting his return trip, causing much discussion in diplomatic circles, who said that the Deputy Secretary's delay was due to other reasons. Secretary of State Hull made a statement to the press yesterday, saying that his mission in Europe was only to collect intelligence and that he did not participate in any negotiations. The intention was clearly to dispel the doubts of the general public. In short, regardless of what kind of peace offensive Germany and Italy launch, the United States has no intention of participating in it directly or indirectly. The true meaning of Hull's statement yesterday was to state this position. Diplomatic circles also said that Deputy Secretary Welles' trip to Europe has never deviated from the position of "observer," and even if someone gives him a peace proposal, he will only attach it to the report to President Roosevelt.

<h3>The Soviet Union is Willing to Rebuild Friendship with Northern European Countries; Setting up Defenses on the Island of Oland; No Longer Insisting on Dissent</h3>
<p>Stockholm. Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Foreign Ministry here said that the Soviet Union no longer opposes the establishment of defenses on the island of Oland, and has promised that it has no territorial ambitions in Northwestern Europe. The Soviet Union also requested to rebuild friendly relations with the Scandinavian countries as soon as possible. (Associated Press 19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Germany to Launch a New Peace Offensive Against Britain and France: Joint Declaration with Italy and the Soviet Union to Maintain Balkan Peninsula Security</h3>
<p>Rome - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, accompanied by Foreign Minister Ciano and the German Ambassador to Italy, Mackensen, returned to Rome by special train at midnight last night. Crowds gathered at the station, cheering and paying their respects. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome - It is widely rumored here that Hitler and Mussolini discussed the establishment of a German-Italian-Soviet group to maintain stability outside the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube region. Political observers believe this move is related to the Soviet-Finnish agreement and the neutral stance of the Scandinavian countries. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German leader Hitler returned to Berlin by special train from Brenner at 11:30 this morning. Although the news of the leader's return was not announced in advance, his arrival was greeted with enthusiastic welcome by the crowds. (Haitong Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<p>Solothurn, Switzerland - A Berlin dispatch in a local newspaper states that one of the results of the Hitler-Mussolini meeting will be a joint declaration by Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union to maintain peace in the Balkan Peninsula. Swiss observers believe that Germany, having secured its northern flank and free from attacks, will now protect itself in Southeastern Europe, using the assistance of Italy and the Soviet Union to expel the influence of the Allied powers in the region. Germany's assistance in reconciliation between the Iron Guard and the Romanian government has already achieved a victory. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Informed sources here announced last night that after the meeting between German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Brenner Pass yesterday, there will be surprising developments this week. It is widely believed that cooperation will be announced between Rome and Moscow. Authorities here are currently maintaining extreme silence, but all parties believe that the content of the two leaders' talks must be related to the formation of a German-Italian-Soviet bloc. The connection of these three countries will weaken the influence of Britain and France in the Balkans and the Near East. The Foreign Ministry here emphasized that the Soviet Union is one of the great powers and has the right to participate in the "New European Order of the Future," even suggesting that the Soviet Union's ambitions extend beyond what it has gained in Poland, the Baltic states, and Finland.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the evening newspapers here praised the "victory" of the bombing of Scapa Flow and the Brenner Pass meeting, and most newspapers especially emphasized the attack on Scapa Flow. An editorial in the "Hamburger Nachrichten" stated that the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini and the air raid on Scapa Flow are sufficient to "show Germany's position in this war. Germany is taking the offensive in both military and political terms." The newspaper concluded, "Germany's military strength and grasp of victory have been clearly demonstrated to those who want to know the truth by the Battle of Scapa Flow and what will continue to happen in the future. Germany will build a historically peaceful 'living room' in Central Europe. Those who obey me will live, and those who resist me will perish." (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German News Agency stated that the details of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini at the Brenner Pass are still unknown here, but the solid foundation of German-Italian cooperation can be seen from this. Observing this fact, it can be known that the hopes of Western European countries that Germany and Italy will be separated on their common foundation are foolish. In yesterday's talks, both sides discussed the major issues of the day in a frank spirit, which is natural. As for certain rumors spread by Britain and France, it seems that Britain and France are still unwilling to understand Hitler's speech in parliament on October 6th of last year, explaining the principles of Germany's attitude in the current war. This was Hitler's last word, but the enemy spokesmen refused it and instead proposed war aims of a criminal nature. From then on, the situation between Western European countries and Germany has become completely clear. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to the "German Diplomatic Political Correspondence," the mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini shows that the Axis powers do not want to give up the work of deciding on European affairs and are determined to guide the reorganization of Europe in the way they believe is correct. The newspaper mentioned that the struggles of Germany and Italy for unity and freedom have the same history, emphasizing that the two countries encountered the same obstacles when realizing the same goals. The "Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger" stated that Hitler and Mussolini, based on the same views, friendly relations, and various agreements, will follow their own paths and solve problems of a decisive nature with their own power. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" stated that the politicians of Western European countries admire empty talk, while Hitler and Mussolini are figures of action and creation. They will determine the fate of Europe. The Allied powers, failing in Northern Europe, will be active in Southern Europe, paying particular attention to Italy. However, the negotiations between Germany and Italy on the coal issue have become the first response to the Allied powers' attempts, and the meeting at the Brenner Pass is the second response.

<h3>Chamberlain Reports on the International Situation in the House of Commons: Says Germany Should be Held Responsible for the Soviet-Finnish War; Britain Has Already Fulfilled its Obligations to Assist Finland</h3>
<p>London - When Prime Minister Chamberlain reported on the current situation in the House of Commons this afternoon, the hearts of the people were particularly anxious, showing a tense atmosphere. U.S. Ambassador Kennedy sat in the diplomatic corps seat next to Soviet Ambassador Maisky. The ambassadors of Belgium, France, Turkey, Argentina, and the ministers of some smaller countries and the commissioners of the autonomous territories in London were also present. When the Prime Minister stood up and mentioned Finland, everyone cheered. The Prime Minister said that the government's initial impression of a major tragedy had occurred, and nothing could change it. Considering the terms of the Finnish-Soviet reconciliation, it can only confirm the view that these terms could only be accepted under direct coercion. It is also useless to assume that these terms do not seriously harm the country's independence and integrity. The Finns, after a long and heroic defense, were ultimately unable to resist a superior enemy in number and equipment. This is a painful concept for all who truly love freedom, but the Finnish resistance was not in vain. They have preserved the glory of Finland and earned the admiration of the world (cheers from the crowd). The Finnish government is still in office, the Finnish army is still intact, and the spirit of the Finnish people has not been broken. If we were in our own country, even though we have done everything we can, we have still failed to save Finland from its misfortune. Our power to help Finland has not yet ended (cheers from the crowd). We should watch the efforts of Finland to rebuild its national life with the deepest sympathy. If Finland continues to need assistance to rebuild, we dare to predict that this country and other countries will be happy to jointly assist Finland's revival. The collapse of Finland's resistance has deeply shaken the world. We have been forced to witness another small country become a victim of an aggressor, and we have taken up arms in resistance. It is expected that German propaganda will use this incident to shirk their responsibility and place it on the shoulders of others, but Germany cannot evade its responsibility (cheers). Without the German-Soviet agreement, Finland would never have been invaded by the Soviet Union. The Scandinavian countries originally intended to aid Finland, but stopped due to Germany's intimidation. If it is said that Britain and France failed to fulfill their obligations and provide Finland with what it needed to the best of their ability, this statement cannot be tolerated for a moment (cheers). If this statement comes from private individuals in countries far from the war (the Prime Minister's words were drowned out by prolonged cheering and could not be heard clearly), these people have never felt any concern for their friends or themselves. The Prime Minister then said that he would like to speak about the issue of aid to Finland in two parts: material aid and manpower aid. Regarding the material aspect, because this country is currently at war, any request for help from friendly neutral countries must be measured against Britain's own needs. The British government is willing to respond to Finland's requests one by one, but it must consider that anything given will reduce its own strength and endanger its own people. It should be known that Finland is far from Britain, and the supplies are at risk and must pass through two foreign countries, along a railway line that is already carrying an excessive amount. Then, the railway passes through Finland for a long distance, and this railway has never been expected to transport these military supplies. Although the difficulties are numerous, the British government has not ignored Finland's appeals. Every request is considered. The Prime Minister then listed the war materials that have been approved for supply and the amounts that have already been shipped, stating that the British government has agreed to assist Finland with 152 aircraft, of which 101 have already been shipped; agreed to assist with 223 cannons; 104 have already been shipped; agreed to assist with 297,700 shells; 185,000 have already been shipped; agreed to assist with 100 Vickers guns, all of which have been shipped; agreed to assist with 500 mines, of which 400 have been shipped; agreed to assist with approximately 50,000 hand grenades, all of which have been shipped; agreed to assist with 20,700 aircraft bombs, of which 15,700 have been shipped; agreed to assist with 200 anti-tank rifles, 60,000 heaters, 100,000 sheepskin coats, 100,000 combat suits, and 48 ambulances, all of which have been shipped. In addition, a large number of small arms and ammunition were also provided. Britain did not hesitate to meet Finland's needs to the best of its ability, even at its own risk. The Prime Minister then addressed the issue of manpower assistance, stating that in mid-January, Finnish Army Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim and General Österman had informed the British representative that the Finnish military was sufficient to hold out until the snow melted, so there was no immediate need for manpower assistance. Mannerheim and General Österman had said that they would be happy to receive 30,000 trained soldiers in May, but Finland and Sweden were both afraid of Germany's reaction, so both countries hoped that if troops were sent to aid Finland, it would not be done publicly. After studying the situation, the British Cabinet realized that an effective force to aid Finland could not be recruited on a voluntary basis. The troops needed in May could only be recruited according to government regulations and formed into a properly organized expeditionary force. The Cabinet then drafted a plan and submitted it to the Supreme Military Council for discussion on February 2. An expeditionary force of 100,000 men was ready to depart, two months earlier than the date agreed upon by Mannerheim and General Österman. The construction plan of the expeditionary force had several important factors to consider, as an effective expeditionary force could not reach Finland without passing through Norway and Sweden, so permission had to be obtained from the governments of those two countries before departure. As for Germany's attitude, it goes without saying. We knew that as soon as Germany heard the rumor that the British and French expeditionary forces would pass through the two countries, it threatened them that if they allowed passage, Germany would intervene. We then realized that we had to prepare another army to help Sweden resist Germany if it was attacked by Germany. If the governments of the two countries allowed passage, the difficulties in transportation would still limit this large army. We considered this situation and decided to send as many troops as possible within the limits of what we could afford to overcome all difficulties. Part of the army would be used to aid Sweden, and another part would be the expeditionary force to aid Finland. In addition, some troops would be needed to maintain the long line of communication. Based on this basis, the number of troops decided to be dispatched was approximately 100,000 men, all fully equipped, and it was agreed that they would begin to arrive in Scandinavia in March, with the entire army arriving at its destination before the end of April. This was not the final army, and the issue of reinforcements would be decided based on the development of the war.</p>
<p>The British government informed Finland of this plan in late February and said that if they continued to need assistance, they should make a public appeal before March 5. We planned to formally apply to the governments of Norway and Sweden for permission for the expeditionary force to pass through as soon as we received this public appeal. We hoped that as a result of Finland's appeal, the governments of the two countries would not obstruct it, but when Finland informally consulted the Swedish government, the Swedish government refused to allow regular troops to pass through. We were very disappointed when we received this news, but our preparations for sending troops did not stop because of this. We still hoped that the governments of Sweden and Norway would change their minds, bravely bear the consequences, and allow us to give Finland the aid we had prepared for Finland. In early March, Finland asked us to allow them to postpone their decision, but Finland never made any decision by the agreed date. The next day, we heard that Finland had accepted the Soviet Union's peace terms. We are not in a position to criticize what the Finns have done. Those who have fought so bravely, like the Finns, must be forgiven and not criticized in any way. The Prime Minister continued, saying that he wanted to make it absolutely clear that the British government has always recognized that the Finns have the right to make their own decisions based on the facts they know. Whatever Britain's claims, it should accept the decisions made by the Finns themselves. Finland has not made any other application for land forces, except for the request by Mannerheim and General Österman to assist with 30,000 soldiers in May.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister solemnly stated again that if Norway and Sweden had allowed the British and French expeditionary forces to pass through, they would have arrived in Finland earlier. He dared to say that Britain and France have never blamed Norway and the two countries for their actions in this incident (applause). But what about Germany? The responsibility for this Finnish war should be entirely borne by Germany. The Prime Minister also expressed doubts about whether Norway and Sweden could maintain their safety. On the contrary, he believed that the danger to the two countries was closer than at any time. Today, the disaster has reached the doorsteps of the two countries, and we must express some sympathy for their position. The two countries originally intended to stay away from the center of the disturbance and not suffer the fate of Czechoslovakia and Poland. He had to point out that this kind of neutralism, which paralyzed the actions of the two countries, was based on an assumption that it was best for small countries to remain neutral and stay out of the war between Germany and the Allied powers. In addition, there was also a concept that no matter the outcome of the war, whether the victor was Germany or the Allies, it would not matter to the small neutral countries. Once the above-mentioned assumptions are abandoned and the necessary inferences are obtained, this policy of small neutral countries will prove to be both unrealistic and insufficient to guarantee their own interests. There will be no way to save them except by deciding to defend themselves and uniting with those who are prepared to help them defend themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, the Prime Minister mentioned the visit to Britain by U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles, saying that the government had welcomed him and fully and frankly expressed its views to him. He believed that Welles would be able to learn the true opinions and emotions of all aspects of Britain. When Welles returned to Italy, a new incident occurred: the meeting of the two dictators at the Brenner Pass. This meeting has naturally caused various speculations from the outside world, some saying that it was to carry out new peace proposals, but whether this is true is still unknown. However, no matter what the consequences, the British government is prepared to deal with them. We do not seem to be relieved of our purpose of joining this war because of this. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>Mouthpiece of German Foreign Ministry Refutes Polish White Paper: Points Out that Poland's Determination to Join the Encirclement of Germany Led to the Failure of Germany's Efforts to Improve Relations with Poland</h3>
<p>Berlin - Regarding the White Paper published by the Polish government in Paris, the "German Diplomatic Political Correspondence," the mouthpiece of the German Foreign Ministry, published an article yesterday to refute it, emphasizing that Poland's determination to join the Allied powers and encircle Germany led to the failure of Germany's efforts to promote German-Polish relations. The White Paper pointed out that relations between Germany and the Soviet Union were not good between 1934 and 1938. True, Berlin, Moscow, and countries all over the world also acknowledge the fact that Germany and the Soviet Union rejected the provocations of Western European countries and were unwilling to fight each other, so they returned to good terms. Although Polish émigré politicians want to use the past German-Soviet relations to provoke today's German-Soviet relations, this Anglo-Soviet relationship is now deeply rooted. German politicians only laugh at the words of alienation. Secondly, regarding the Polish White Paper's claim that Poland never demanded the Free City of Danzig, German officials pointed out that the history of the Free City of Danzig is full of facts about avoiding Polish political, economic, and cultural aggression. Moreover, the reason why Polish Foreign Minister Beck rejected Germany's proposals for Danzig and the corridor on March 26th of last year was entirely influenced by Britain. Thirdly, the Polish White Paper provides very little narrative on the facts between April and August 1939, which shows that Britain and France did not allow Poland to publicize the process of Britain encouraging and promoting Poland, while also indicating that Poland has no documents to prove "loyalty to the Germanic nation." Finally, regarding the White Paper's claim that Poland only knew of Germany's proposal on the evening of August 31, German officials solemnly refuted it, believing it to be a repeated lie. In fact, the German government had notified British Ambassador Henderson on August 30, and Henderson immediately informed the Polish Ambassador, who reported to the Warsaw government.

<h3>Case of American International News Service Reporter Young's Arrest in Japan: Analysis from the Perspective of International Law by American Lawyer Mr. Olerud</h3>
<p>Mr. Young, a correspondent for the American International News Service stationed in Japan, was previously arrested by the Japanese police authorities and is still in custody. Recently, the spokesperson for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that Mr. Young's actions violated Article 99 of the Japanese Army Disciplinary Code, and according to Article 3 of that code, it also applies to those who spread unfounded rumors outside the borders of Japan. How this incident will develop and end in the future is currently unpredictable. Mr. Olerud, an American lawyer in this city, is well-versed in law and has provided a detailed analysis from the perspective of international regulations. An excerpt of the translation is as follows:</p>
<p>The recent indictment of an American journalist in Japan has focused attention on two opposing views regarding international public law. One view holds that an action committed in country A, even if it constitutes a crime, cannot be considered a crime in country B. The other view is that a country can punish an action as a crime, even if it was committed outside its territory. According to the first view, the place where the crime was committed determines jurisdiction, while countries that hold the opposite view determine jurisdiction based on the defendant's presence within their borders.</p>
<p>Some important countries do not exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed by non-nationals within the territory of other countries. The United States is a major country that holds this view, but Britain, Denmark, and Portugal also hold the same view. These countries seem to believe that according to international public law, no country should exercise jurisdiction over such cases, and their jurisdiction is governed by the laws of the place where the crime was committed.</p>
<p>"In a directive dated August 7, 1844, U.S. Secretary of State Calhoun to the then-U.S. Ambassador to England, Everett, clearly summarized the U.S. view. A section of this directive, as recorded in Moore's Digest of International Law, is as follows: 'An action committed in one country, even if it is a crime according to that country's laws, may not be a crime according to the laws of another country. In a legal sense, a crime is local because the law of the country where the act is committed declares that act to be a crime, and therefore it is a crime only in that place. Britain cannot, through its laws, make an act committed within the jurisdiction of the United States, no matter how immoral it may be, a crime within British territory, and vice versa for the United States. This premise is so clear that it needs no explanation or argument. But if this point is acknowledged, then another point must also be acknowledged, which is that the crimes mentioned in the annex must be judged by the laws of the place where the crime was committed, and not by the laws of the place where the fugitive is found.'"</p>
<p>However, some important countries, although implementing different methods, do not adhere to this territorial principle. These countries mostly claim jurisdiction over crimes that violate their national security or reputation, even if they were committed entirely within the territory of other countries. Mexico, Greece, the Soviet Union, Brazil, and China all seem to claim jurisdiction over cases where their own laws and the "law of the place where the crime was committed" both define the act as a crime. Austria, France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Norway, Japan, and several other countries all claim jurisdiction over actions committed by foreigners in other countries that violate their national security or reputation.</p>
<p>The United States and Britain, in cases involving non-nationals, especially ordinary crimes, almost exclusively claim jurisdiction based on territorial and personal grounds. Both countries recognize universal regulations to some extent, such as piracy on the high seas, but there are also situations that differ from this strict territorial and personal theory. For example, Section 22 of the U.S. Immigration Act of 1914 stipulates that false statements or deceptions in immigration applications, even if committed abroad, can be punished. Foreigners cannot commit treason against the United States abroad, but it seems possible to prosecute actions of treason against the United States according to one or more national laws.</p>
<p>Apart from Britain and the United States, although most countries claim the right to jurisdiction over non-nationals who commit crimes that undermine their national security and reputation, and many other crimes, it is surprisingly rare to find famous cases involving violations of the above-mentioned laws. The Cutting Case, the Lotus Case, the Shaw Case, and the Gao Ying Case can be considered notable cases.</p>
<p>The Cutting Case</p>
<p>In 1886, Cutting, a U.S. citizen, published a notice in a newspaper in El Paso, Texas, criticizing certain legal procedures of Medina, a Mexican citizen. As a result, Cutting was tried and imprisoned in El Paso del Norte, Mexico, and sentenced to one year in prison and a fine. The U.S. government strongly protested, and Cutting was released by the Supreme Court of Chihuahua, Mexico.</p>
<p>The Lotus Case</p>
<p>On August 2, 1926, near midnight, the French mail steamer Lotus, en route to Constantinople, collided with the Turkish coal ship Boz-Kurt about five or six nautical miles north of Cape Sigri. The Boz-Kurt broke in two and sank, and eight Turkish people on board died. The Lotus made every effort to rescue the survivors and rescued ten people, then continued to Constantinople. When it arrived there on August 3, the Lotus's watch officer, Lieutenant Demons, was arrested and charged with manslaughter. The French government disputed the jurisdiction of the Turkish court, arguing that if a crime had been committed, it had been committed on a French ship on the high seas, and that France considered its ships to be French territory, so only France had the right to question Lieutenant Demons. In 1927, France and Turkey agreed to submit the case to the Permanent Court of International Justice for adjudication. The court ruled that there was dual jurisdiction, but the judges of the court held two opposing views, each occupying half, with the Chief Justice casting the deciding vote. The view held by one of the dissenting judges, Judge Moore, perhaps expressed the French view, while also stating the U.S. view. His opinion was that Turkey's claim of jurisdiction violated the following three principles of international law:</p>
<p>(1) A country's jurisdiction over its territory is exclusive.</p>
<p>(2) Foreigners traveling in a country must obey the local laws and seek judicial protection from the country's courts.</p>
<p>(3) A country may not punish a foreigner for violating laws that they were not required to obey when the crime was committed.</p>
<p>The Shaw Case</p>
<p>Shaw, a British national residing in Andong, China, went to Korea in 1920. The Japanese authorities alleged that Shaw had engaged in actions in China that violated Japanese law and detained him for several months. The British government demanded his release, one of the reasons being that Shaw, in this situation, should be subject to British consular jurisdiction in China and not be subject to Japanese jurisdiction for any actions in China. Four months later, Shaw was released, presumably without a formal trial.</p>
<p>The Gao Ying Case</p>
<p>Gao Ying, an official at the Chinese consulate in the United States, was involved in the purchase and sale of narcotics with several Americans. He could have been tried in the United States or in China. As a result, Gao Ying was returned to China for trial. This may have been because the U.S. authorities, due to Gao Ying's official position and for the sake of friendly relations between the two countries, did not try him in the United States, but allowed him to be tried by his own national authorities.</p>
<p>Such cases are very rare. The reason for this may be that countries have different views on this matter, and when such cases occur, the defendant's national government often lodges a strong protest.</p>
<p>A country questioning a national of another country for a crime committed outside its jurisdiction often causes international friction. Many countries have now entered into extradition treaties that are closely related to this matter, which may avoid many cases of this nature.</p>
<h3>The Commercial Decline and Soaring Prices in Wuxi Lead to Widespread Poverty and Rampant Banditry</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The commercial heart of Wuxi County, from Kongjiangmen to Sanliqiao, lies along the canal, benefiting from convenient water and land transportation. Shops of all kinds line the streets in close proximity, especially rice, wheat, and grain merchants, who gather here. Cargo ships from various ports moor along the North Embankment, making it a distribution center for rice and grain in Southeast China. After the outbreak of war, it was completely destroyed by fire. Since the occupation two years ago, a small number of merchants have pooled their resources to build simple houses and set up shops to earn meager profits. The North District market now appears to be in good condition on the surface, but in reality, it is mostly strong on the outside and weak on the inside. This is because the rice industry has always been the most important, followed by daily necessities. Before the war, capitalists from this and other ports often invested heavily in various industries. Since the occupation, those with large amounts of capital have mostly fled to safety with their funds and have not yet returned. Therefore, the current commercial activities are mostly based on pooled funds, with very little large-scale investment. Business transactions are mostly conducted in cash, with immediate buying and selling, and there are no shops that hoard large quantities of goods. In the previous two years, various industries experienced abnormal growth, with considerable profits. Between last summer and autumn, foreign exchange plummeted, the legal tender depreciated drastically, and the European war caused prices to soar. Various industries made double profits in an instant. However, in reality, due to the low value of the legal tender, widespread poverty, and the weak purchasing power of urban and rural residents, business is unusually sluggish. Although there was a surplus at the end of last winter, since the market opened this year, with the exception of necessities such as rice and grain, the prospects for other shops are bleak unless prices can be reduced. Moreover, banditry is rampant in Wuxi, occurring several times a day. Houqijie outside the north gate and Tongji Bridge and other places have been repeatedly robbed. During the robberies, bandits often burn the lower bodies of their victims. In half a month, there have been more than ten such cases, and four or five people have died from the resulting infections. The Pu Ren Hospital is filled with patients seeking treatment for their injuries. The residents are living in misery, and the Japanese and puppet authorities are unable to maintain order. It is said that most of the bandits are local gangsters and have close ties with the puppet police. Unless the problem is addressed at its root, there will be no end to banditry.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Local Commemoration Day Tomorrow: Schools in This City Will Be Closed for One Day</h3>
<p>(Da Hua News Agency) Tomorrow (the 21st) is the Shanghai Local Commemoration Day. In the past, schools were closed for one day. Last year, due to the War of Resistance, the city's education supervisory authorities issued a notice to all schools, prohibiting them from taking a holiday on this day and requiring them to hold classes as usual. Now, because the leader has indicated that our country's War of Resistance has achieved final victory, the education supervisory authorities have notified all schools to follow the usual practice and close for one day to commemorate the event.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Opens Cram School for High School Graduates in Kunming</h3>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: To help high school graduates enter higher education, the Ministry of Education has opened a cram school for high school graduates in Kunming, with the aim of providing remedial instruction in basic subjects. The "Student Guidance Office in Kunming for Students from Various Places" was instructed to make preparations. The office appointed Cha Liangzhao, Wu Chunwu, and Hu Shuyi as members of the preparatory committee. Preparations began in early February, and placement tests were held on March 3, with classes officially starting on the 6th. The Ministry of Education has now formally appointed Hu Shuyu as the head of the class. It is reported that the class is divided into male and female sections, with 300 students actually enrolled, representing nineteen provinces and cities.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Examination for College Entrance Exams: Passing Students to Receive Training, with More Than Seventy Lecturers</h3>
<p>Kunming Correspondence: More than 120 students who passed the preliminary examination for the Central Government's college entrance exams this year began training on the 1st of this month in a certain location in Chongqing. This training is entirely militarized, with a tight schedule. The curriculum is extremely demanding, divided into five main categories: spiritual talks, political courses, supplementary courses, military training, and physical education. Approximately seventy lecturers are responsible for teaching, all of whom are heads of various ministries and departments. Students will receive six months of training at the school, then be assigned to various places to serve in various communities for one month of practical experience and four months of internships. Finally, they will return to school to prepare reports and participate in a second examination. Those who pass will be officially employed according to the law. A monthly allowance of thirty yuan will be provided during the training period.</p>
<h3>Guidance for Middle School Students' Life (4)</h3>
<p>— Wang Maozu</p>
<p>B. Special Guidance</p>
<p>First, "Guidance for Service." During the War of Resistance, the Ministry of Education issued supplemental wartime curricula for middle schools and outlines for wartime youth service. In terms of training principles, there is consistency between peacetime and wartime. However, in terms of activities, certain items have been added due to environmental and time needs. I believe that it is appropriate to concentrate on a few sensitive items so that schools can effectively implement them. The first is production, which should involve students helping farmers with transplanting seedlings, sowing seeds, harvesting, and other side occupations. Since many schools have been dispersed to the countryside, they should live according to rural life, without needing summer vacations, and can change to agricultural vacations. The second is propaganda and mass education, which students are most capable of doing, but they must have propaganda skills and medical knowledge to treat common diseases for farmers to be more effective. The third is labor service, selecting what students are able to do. The fourth is rescue and assistance in the relief of refugee children. In addition, career guidance has never been well-managed in various places. After the war started, on the one hand, many students became unemployed or changed jobs. On the other hand, the conditions of occupations have greatly expanded due to the War of Resistance. All opportunities related to military affairs, transportation, rescue, and reclamation, production, medical, and news careers in the rear need people everywhere. In normal times, one can muddle through in various institutions, but now it is impossible to muddle through. The type of work that each person is suited for can be tested immediately. Because there is an urgent need for talent, many short-term training courses have to be opened. However, because of the short-term training, career guidance must be given special attention so that each person can make the most of their talents. In short, guidance for being a person and a citizen should be based on the New Life Movement standards. Guidance for service and work should also develop students' ability to cope with the present from practical activities, and explore students' interests and specialties so that each can make the most of their abilities. The lessons of the War of Resistance have had a great effect and transformation on middle school education: (1) From superficial to practical life, (2) From lecturing to automatic creation, (3) From being isolated from society to deeply entering society, (4) From special life to rural life.

<h3>This Year's High School Enrollment in Fujian Province to Be Held Concurrently with Junior High School Joint Exams</h3>
<p>(Yong'an Correspondence) Recently, Private Union College Principal Lin, Provincial Assembly member, and De Yi and thirty-one others jointly submitted a petition to the Provincial Government, stating that the number of students admitted in the province's unified high school enrollment last year was too small, and requesting approval to increase the number of students enrolled in high schools throughout the province and to improve the unified enrollment methods. The Provincial Government replied, "There were 1,899 students participating in the junior high school graduation joint exams and supplementary exams in the second semester of the 27th year. Apart from 611 students who failed and should repeat the grade, only 1,288 students are allowed to graduate and provisionally advance to higher education. (The original petition stated that the number of junior high school graduates in the province last year was 2,424, which does not match the facts.) The enrollment quota for high schools throughout the province for the first semester of the 28th year was set at 1,500, which is sufficient to accommodate the aforementioned junior high school graduates who wish to advance to higher education and students with equivalent qualifications. However, due to the poor performance of the examinees, the admission standards have already been lowered, and the number of students admitted is still less than the prescribed quota. In recent years, the Provincial Government has paid special attention to improving the teaching and enriching the facilities of various junior high schools. The schools should work together to improve students' levels in order to meet the admission standards. As for the number of students to be recruited by public and private high schools throughout the province in the 29th year, it will be determined after the junior high schools submit the lists of graduates from previous years, taking into account the number of junior high school graduates, the financial resources and equipment of the high schools, and the needs of the local area. The enrollment examination will be held concurrently with the junior high school joint exams, as reported by the Department of Education, and the methods will be announced separately." It is also reported that the photos and rosters of graduates from previous years and students taking supplementary exams in public and private junior high schools in Fujian Province for the second semester of the 28th year should be submitted to the Department of Education by the end of April of this year.</p>

<p>工部局研究　節减行政經費　組特別委員會專任其事</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Studies Reducing Administrative Expenses; Forms Special Committee for the Task</p>
<p>有人主張增加奢侈稅率</p>
<p>Some Advocate Increasing Luxury Tax Rates</p>
<p>工部局現已組織一特別委員會、對於局方行政經費可否節减一層、加以硏究、委員人選、為華董奚玉書·西董鮑惠雨·渣華郵船公司經理卡立雅·曁在華日本紡織同業會理事岡本一策等四人、惟聞最近期內、尙不能向局方提佻報吿云、又據外傳工部局業已向食港及上海銀行界、獲得借款一千萬元、此項借款、須依照初定計劃、增加捐稅百分之一百、始能償淸、工部局因鑒於各方之反對、乃不得不就預算之各方面、力求撙節、</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has now organized a special committee to study whether administrative expenses can be reduced. The committee members are Mr. Xi Yushu, a Chinese director; Mr. Bao Huiyu, a Western director; Mr. Kalija, the manager of Java Mail Steamer Company; and Mr. Okamoto Ikksaku, director of the Japanese Textile Manufacturers Association in China. However, it is rumored that a report cannot be submitted to the bureau in the near future. Furthermore, it is rumored that the Shanghai Municipal Council has obtained a loan of ten million yuan from the banking circles in Hong Kong and Shanghai. According to the initial plan, this loan can only be repaid by increasing taxes by 100%. In light of opposition from all sides, the Shanghai Municipal Council has had to strive for frugality in all aspects of the budget.</p>
<p>加捐負擔仍為平民</p>
<p>Increased Tax Burden Still Falls on the Common People</p>
<p>據納稅人稱、工部局倘所擬加捐、付之實行、此其後果、不難想像、市政總捐（房捐）現行微收率、為房租百分之十八、如再增捐百分之五十、則無異將捐率增至合房租之百分之二十七、上海習慣、房捐除房主自居自付外、其餘概山承租人二房東繳付、戰後曾因加捐及水電費增加、二房東與三房客間、為加租糾紛迭起、茲再加捐百分之五十、則二房東仍轉嫁於三房客、加租糾紛又將澎湃、又地捐增加、亦必刺激房產業主提高租金、彼此轉嫁、最後負擔者、仍為一般平民、目前高物價、平民均巳焦頭爛額、尙復能繼續誅求乎、</p>
<p>According to taxpayers, if the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposed tax increases are implemented, the consequences are not difficult to imagine. The current levy rate for the Municipal General Tax (property tax) is 18% of the rent. If it is increased by another 50%, it would be the same as raising the tax rate to 27% of the rent. According to Shanghai custom, property tax, except for homeowners who live in and pay their own taxes, is generally paid by tenants and sub-landlords. After the war, due to increased taxes and utility costs, rent disputes arose repeatedly between sub-landlords and third-party tenants. Now, if the tax is increased by another 50%, the sub-landlords will still pass it on to the third-party tenants, and rent disputes will surge again. Furthermore, an increase in land tax will inevitably encourage property owners to raise rents, passing the burden on to each other, with the final burden falling on the general public. With current high prices, the common people are already overwhelmed; how can they continue to be exploited?</p>
<p>增奢侈稅寓禁於征</p>
<p>Increasing Luxury Taxes Combines Prohibition with Taxation</p>
<p>在此時艱、停止加捐、為中外同深切望、設工部局節流上果無辦法、而定欲藉增捐以彌補虧空、平衡預算、亦應轉移目標於奢侈消耗方面、因此項捐稅、取之無妨於平民生計、有一部份人士主張、工部局在此財政困難之時、不妨增收各項奢侈稅、如舞塲遊藝塲戲院等、因此項增稅轉嫁之結果、為有力之消費者、稅收雖重、不失寓禁於征、</p>
<p>In these difficult times, stopping tax increases is the deep hope of both Chinese and foreigners. If the Shanghai Municipal Council truly has no way to reduce expenditures and is determined to make up for deficits and balance the budget by increasing taxes, it should shift its focus to luxury consumption. This type of tax does not harm the livelihood of the common people. Some people advocate that the Shanghai Municipal Council, in this time of financial difficulty, may as well increase various luxury taxes, such as on dance halls, amusement parks, and theaters. The result of passing on this tax increase is powerful consumers, and although the tax revenue is heavy, it does not lose the combination of prohibition and taxation.</p>

<p>Before Easter, this Thursday, the Great British Chapel will hold special commemorations at 7:30 AM, 10:30 AM, and 5:03 PM. On Friday, memorial services will be held in various churches, presided over by church leaders, from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM. Commemorative work for Chinese people will be from 3:15 PM to 5:15 PM, and after 6:00 PM will be the work of the church bands. On Saturday, all churches in the city will commemorate from 8:45 AM to 5:30 PM. At that time, it will also be broadcast on XMHA radio. Major foreign firms, consulates, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, banks, money houses, etc., will be closed for three days from the 22nd to the 25th. However, the Shanghai Post Office and the Jianghai Customs will continue to work as usual.</p>
<p>國內郵資增價　祗限於信函類</p>
<p>Domestic Postage Increase Limited to Letters</p>
<p>平信郵資本埠三分外埠七分　新聞紙及印刷品等並不增價</p>
<p>Local Ordinary Postage Three Cents, Out-of-Town Seven Cents; Newspapers and Printed Matter Not Increased</p>
<p>國內郵資、據大通計記者探悉、尙係於民國二十一年五月一度增價、迄茲已歷時九年、以目前人力物力暨運輸上之費用增高、故民衆對郵政資費之酌量增價、殆為極合乎情理之舉措、據悉此次增價、祗限於信函方面、如新聞紙印刷品、聞並不增價、故於文化事業毫無影響、關於增加數額、據西南方面郵局所透露、平信本埤由二分增至三分、外埠由五分加為七分　明信片則由二分半增為三分半、掛號信由一角三分增為二角、平快郵件由一角增至一角四分、快遞掛號由一角七分增加為二角五分、故其遞增數額、亦殊有限、惟是否於四月一日起實行一點、則上海郵政管理局尙未奉到總局命令、猶難明悉、</p>
<p>According to reports from Datong, domestic postage was last increased in May of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), nine years ago. Due to the current increase in labor, materials, and transportation costs, a reasonable increase in postal rates is a very logical measure. It is understood that this increase is limited to letters. It is said that newspapers and printed matter will not be increased, so there is no impact on cultural undertakings. Regarding the amount of the increase, according to the post office in the southwest, local ordinary letters will increase from two cents to three cents, and out-of-town letters will increase from five cents to seven cents. Postcards will increase from two and a half cents to three and a half cents, registered letters from 13 cents to 20 cents, ordinary express mail from 10 cents to 14 cents, and express registered mail from 17 cents to 25 cents. Therefore, the amount of the increase is also very limited. However, whether it will be implemented on April 1st has not been clarified, as the Shanghai Postal Administration has not yet received orders from the head office.</p>
<p>美名法學家霍薩曼談　美國不應退出遠東</p>
<p>Famous American Jurist Hossam Talks: The United States Should Not Withdraw from the Far East</p>
<p>如允可菲島如期宣布獨立　恐一旦實現必遭他國侵略</p>
<p>If the Philippines is Allowed to Declare Independence as Scheduled, It is Feared That It Will Be Invaded by Other Countries Once It Becomes a Reality</p>
<p>在馬尼剌負有盛名之法官霍薩曼氏、昨日由馬尼剌抵滬、對菲列賓之獨立問題、發表談話、叙述頗詳、茲誌其大要如下、美政府雖巳宣布自一九四六年起、允可菲列賓宣布獨立、霍薩曼氏以為、此舉如果實現、則無異宣布美國·英國·法國·荷蘭·及其他歐西各國之在遠東權益、其末日將臨、蓋菲列賓一旦宣布獨立、將被日人所併吞、實僅係時間問題、</p>
<p>Judge Hossam, who enjoys a high reputation in Manila, arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Manila and gave a detailed speech on the issue of Philippine independence. The main points are recorded below. Although the U.S. government has announced that it will allow the Philippines to declare independence starting in 1946, Mr. Hossam believes that if this is realized, it would be tantamount to announcing the end of the rights and interests of the United States, Britain, France, the Netherlands, and other Western countries in the Far East. Once the Philippines declares independence, it will be annexed by the Japanese, which is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>一旦獨立命運堪憂</p>
<p>Fate is Worrying Once Independent</p>
<p>訪者詢及菲人是否願於一九四六年後、仍受美國政府之保護、時霍薩曼氏莞爾稱、「恕余不能代表菲人、表示意見」、惟霍薩曼氏認為如在一九四六年七月四日、菲列賓實行宣布獨立、則菲人此後之命運、自堪憂慮、以日人之侵略勢力、固無一不足以威脅菲人也、故苟菲人明乎此種危機、聲請自願繼續受美國之保護、則美政府當即可推翻成議、</p>
<p>When asked whether Filipinos would still be willing to be protected by the U.S. government after 1946, Mr. Hossam smiled and said, "Please forgive me for not being able to represent the Filipinos and express my opinions." However, Mr. Hossam believes that if the Philippines implements its declaration of independence on July 4, 1946, the fate of the Filipinos thereafter is worrying. The aggressive forces of the Japanese are sufficient to threaten the Filipinos. Therefore, if the Filipinos understand this crisis and request to continue to be protected by the United States, the U.S. government should be able to overturn the agreement.</p>
<p>美國貿易必受影響</p>
<p>U.S. Trade Will Be Affected</p>
<p>至目前菲人一致要求獨立、　間雖未嘗元反對之者、惟因不願違反領袖之意志、與損害國家體面、故此舉現時尙未露顯著之跡象、菲列賓總統奎松氏、對於獨立、恐已作秘密之準備矣、霍薩曼氏復又稱、關於菲列賓獨立問題、渠曾徵求美國旅菲巨商之意見、彼等對此項問題、均不十分重視、而僅認為菲島宣布獨立後、美商對菲對華貿易、必受重大影響、</p>
<p>Currently, Filipinos unanimously demand independence, and although there are no opponents, because they do not want to violate the will of their leaders and damage national prestige, this move has not yet shown significant signs. Philippine President Quezon may have already made secret preparations for independence. Mr. Hossam further stated that regarding the issue of Philippine independence, he had sought the opinions of American tycoons traveling in the Philippines. They did not pay much attention to this issue and only believed that after the Philippine Islands declared independence, U.S. trade with the Philippines and China would be significantly affected.</p>
<p>日本勢將獨覇遠東</p>
<p>Japan Will Dominate the Far East</p>
<p>惟霍薩曼氏認為美國在菲列賓之勢力、實足為穩定遠東局勢之唯一原動力、如美國勢力一旦撒離菲島、首先受影響者、常為英國、蓋英國勢必被排出於遠東及中國之外也、其次法國、亦將不保其在越南之勢力、荷蘭將喪失統制荷屬東印度之權力、若是、日本將一躍而執遠東之牛耳矣、</p>
<p>However, Mr. Hossam believes that the U.S. influence in the Philippines is the only driving force to stabilize the situation in the Far East. If U.S. influence is withdrawn from the Philippine Islands, the first to be affected will be Britain, because Britain will inevitably be excluded from the Far East and China. Secondly, France will also be unable to maintain its influence in Vietnam, and the Netherlands will lose its power to control the Dutch East Indies. If so, Japan will leap to the forefront and dominate the Far East.</p>
<p>兩大條件尙未具體</p>
<p>Two Major Conditions Not Yet Concrete</p>
<p>惟美國之宣布菲島獨立、在另一方面言、未始非遠東各國之福、在遠東各國中、日本當然為獲利最厚者、其他各國、則或將因菲列賓民治意識之逐漸擴大、而使遠東各國一致奮起、霍薩曼氏又以為菲島如欲宣布獨立、必須具有之條件、為二千五百萬或三千五百萬之人口、而其經濟及軍事機構、均足以抵禦外侮時始可、彼又以為菲島獨立後、其人民之生活程度、或將减低、蓋在美菲間之貿易、必彼此互相减低物價、以冀在海外競銷、</p>
<p>However, from another perspective, the United States' announcement of Philippine independence may not be a blessing for all countries in the Far East. Among the countries in the Far East, Japan will of course be the biggest beneficiary. Other countries may be inspired by the gradual expansion of the Philippine people's awareness of civil rights, causing all countries in the Far East to rise up together. Mr. Hossam also believes that if the Philippine Islands want to declare independence, they must have a population of 25 million or 35 million, and their economic and military institutions must be sufficient to resist foreign aggression. He also believes that after the Philippine Islands become independent, the living standards of its people may decline, because trade between the United States and the Philippines will inevitably reduce prices for each other in order to compete in overseas sales.</p>
<p>霍氏略歷年高德劭</p>
<p>Mr. Hossam's Brief History: Old, Respected, and Highly Virtuous</p>
<p>按霍薩曼氏年巳七十有五、為菲島著名之兩大礦業公司之大股東、霍氏為美俄亥俄州人、曾參加美國與西班牙之戰爭、戰後即至菲島執行律師職務、一九一五年投資開發金礦、因是成名、為世界著名之鉅商與推事、數年前、霍氏曾返俄亥俄州故里、而建立該州之唯一銀行、霍氏此次來滬、純屬旅行性質、彼頗希望能於最近甫返故鄕一游云、</p>
<p>Mr. Hossam is 75 years old and a major shareholder in two famous mining companies in the Philippine Islands. Mr. Hossam is from Ohio, USA. He participated in the Spanish-American War and went to the Philippine Islands after the war to practice law. In 1915, he invested in the development of gold mines and became famous for this. He is a world-renowned businessman and judge. A few years ago, Mr. Hossam returned to his hometown in Ohio and established the state's only bank. Mr. Hossam's visit to Shanghai this time is purely for travel purposes. He hopes to visit his recently returned home soon.</p>

<p>The 29th of this month is the Commemoration Day of the Martyrs of the Huanghuagang Uprising.

<p>The Lost Battalion Barracks has scheduled the Revolutionary Martyrs' Day on March 29. In addition to holding a grand commemorative ceremony at 9:00 AM, the battalion will also commemorate the 811 flag-martyred soldiers who died in battle during the defense of the Sihang Warehouse, as well as soldiers who died from overwork and illness. Donations of memorial banners and scrolls from all sectors are welcome and will be converted into coal and rice coupons to help refugees. Yesterday, according to Commander Xie Jinyuan's announcement to a reporter from the New Voice Society, "Mr. Tao inquired in a letter whether the name of the Lost Battalion could be used to raise coal and rice coupons outside to help refugees. I believe that door-to-door fundraising is strictly prohibited. If a campaign is launched within a school, organization, or company, it is permissible. All donations to this camp, whether goods or cash, will be acknowledged with a receipt signed by me personally. For the past two days, all donations of coal and rice funds have been declined and not accepted. Starting from today (the 19th), these funds will be accepted and sent directly to this camp. No matter whether it is monetary donations or coal and rice coupons, they must not be used for any other purpose. The method of distribution should be appropriate. After a considerable amount has been accumulated, we plan to publicly solicit opinions from all sectors in order to ensure that refugees are truly benefited."</p>

<p>According to a dispatch from Hong Kong on the 18th, all sectors of Shanghai attach great importance to the issue of implementing constitutionalism. However, due to the special environment, there are some communication barriers regarding the central government's views on implementing constitutionalism. The reporter specially visited Mr. Wu Kaixian, Deputy Minister of the Central Organization Department (former Director-General of the Shanghai Election Office), who kindly provided detailed answers to the various questions raised: (Q) What is your opinion on the implementation of constitutionalism? (A) The Kuomintang's convening of the National Assembly and implementing constitutionalism this time is to implement the party's consistent principles over the past few decades. However, the tutelage work promoted by our party has not been completed on schedule in recent years due to many national affairs. Therefore, during the implementation of constitutionalism, we will continue to promote the unfinished work of tutelage, so that the future realization of constitutionalism can have satisfactory results and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past hasty actions. (Q) Regarding the election and powers of the National Assembly representatives, some people now advocate re-elections and propose to clarify their powers. Is this feasible? (A) The central government has already made regulations regarding the election of National Assembly representatives, and they have been completed in accordance with the law. The representatives produced by the elected regions are all valid, except for those who have defected to the enemy. This is a matter of legal principle. Moreover, organizing elections on the ground is by no means easy, nor can it be completed in a short period of time. During this period of resistance against Japan, everything is even more difficult. This kind of advocacy for re-election is a naive view that completely misunderstands the actual situation and only serves to confuse people. As for the issue of the powers of the representatives, it should wait until the constitution is passed and exercised in accordance with the powers granted by the constitution. At this moment, it is impossible to limit the powers of the constitutional assembly with organizational laws or to predetermine the content of the constitution. The central government has already made a solemn clarification on this matter. Those who advocate this may not have seen the central government's previous explanations and have this misunderstanding. (Q) What are your opinions on the draft constitution? (A) The draft constitution has been carefully drafted by the Legislative Yuan and then promulgated. Its legality and solemnity are beyond doubt. However, the central government is still concerned that it may not have been able to fully express its views, so any suggestions can still be submitted to the National Assembly in accordance with the law. The central government's concern for public opinion and its emphasis on the constitution can also be seen in general. (Q) Is there a general organization in Shanghai to promote the constitution? (A) Promoting constitutionalism is an expression that the people should have. However, due to the special environment in Shanghai, there is no such organization. However, various legitimate groups and patriotic mass organizations that have emerged due to the war of resistance have mostly begun to study the content of the draft constitution and the preparation for implementing constitutionalism. They will organize and discuss the opinions they have obtained, formulate plans, and send them to the National Senate or the National Assembly representatives in Shanghai for submission. In fact, there seems to be no need for such an organization. (Q) Some publications and other printed matter in Shanghai seem to be overstepping the scope of their discussion on the issue of implementing constitutionalism. Does this contain other backgrounds or malicious effects? (A) I believe that most of these publications do not understand the past handling of this National Assembly of National Representatives, resulting in all sorts of unnecessary disputes over many concluded issues (such as election laws, etc.). This is really a waste of ink. Moreover, I believe that all those who sincerely seek the country will not forget the biggest issue at hand when discussing any issue and will never take actions that divide people's hearts and shake their faith. Therefore, I once held a forum with many enthusiastic political figures in Shanghai. After detailed discussions on this issue, they have all understood it. Whether a few publications are still discussing this issue for other purposes is still unknown. However, at a time when the puppet regime is also chanting "constitutionalism" to confuse people, we cannot but pay attention. I hope that those in Shanghai who are enthusiastic about constitutionalism should be seriously vigilant when discussing this issue and be careful not to be used by others to damage the central government's prestige and be laughed at by the Japanese puppets. This is what we should pay close attention to.</p>

<p>幾步景昇輪覆轍</p>
<p>Nearly Repeating the Tragedy of the Jingsheng</p>
<p>哈納輪船、十八日由滬駛抵鎮海口外、當日下午二時、由天寳駁輪接運旅客駛進甬江、及駛至淸水浦地方、突與新大利駁輪互撞、雙方受傷、而以天寳輪傷勢尤重、一時旅客大起驚皇、以為又將肇景昇輪慘禍、幸駁輪公司得訊、當派新寗餘駁輪將受驚旅客、轉駁抵埠、方各慶生還、亦云險矣、</p>
<p>The Hana ship arrived outside Zhenhai Harbor from Shanghai on the 18th. At 2:00 PM that afternoon, the Tianbao barge took over the transfer of passengers to enter the Yong River. When it reached the Qingshui Pu area, it suddenly collided with the Xin Daliai barge. Both sides were injured, and the Tianbao barge was more seriously damaged. Passengers were panicked for a moment, thinking that the tragedy of the Jingsheng ship was about to be repeated. Fortunately, the barge company received the news and sent the Xin Ningyu barge to transfer the frightened passengers to the dock, and everyone was glad to be alive. It was indeed dangerous.</p>
<p>中國古玩書畫珍寳　充斥美國各都市</p>
<p>Chinese Antiques, Calligraphy, Painting and Treasures Flood American Cities</p>
<p>引起其硏究之興趣與決心</p>
<p>Arousing Interest and Determination to Study Them</p>
<p>對中國文化表示深切同情</p>
<p>Expressing Deep Sympathy for Chinese Culture</p>
<p>美國某著名古玩珠寳商、於昨日抵滬、對記者談稱、中國古玩珍品書畫、最近充斥美國市上、至於中國古玩運銷美國如是衆多之主要原因、渠以為約有二因、第一、居住於淪陷區或非淪陷區內之華人、均恐所藏之古玩珍品遭無妄之災、故一致將所有送往美國保存、或在美獲得高價脫售</p>
<p>A famous American antique and jewelry dealer arrived in Shanghai yesterday and told reporters that Chinese antiques, treasures, calligraphy, and paintings have recently flooded the American market. As for the main reasons why so many Chinese antiques are transported and sold in the United States, he believes that there are two reasons: First, Chinese people living in occupied or non-occupied areas are all afraid that their collections of antiques and treasures will suffer unwarranted disasters, so they all send their possessions to the United States for safekeeping or sell them at high prices in the United States.</p>
<p>第二、淪陷區中之日人、大半均由日軍手中搜集古玩珍寳、而運銷美國、以圖重利、現美人對中國古玩珍寳、已發生極大興趣、對中國之古代藝術、均表驚異、職是之故、美人對中國之一切問題、其人民之生活、其人民受日機轟炸之慘狀等等、均表深切同情</p>
<p>Second, most of the Japanese people in the occupied areas collect antiques and treasures from the Japanese army and transport and sell them to the United States in order to make a large profit. Now, Americans have developed a great interest in Chinese antiques and treasures, and they are all amazed by the ancient art of China. For this reason, Americans have deep sympathy for all issues related to China, the lives of its people, the tragic state of its people being bombed by Japanese planes, etc.</p>

<h3>Finance European Peace Makes No Progress, US Dollar Speculators Surge Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation showed that listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The British-American exchange rate in the unofficial market continued to fluctuate. Although the outcome was slightly firmer, there seemed to be a brewing trend towards softening. Speculators, considering the outcome of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, saw no progress towards peace on the Western Front and a possibility of escalating the war. Foreign dispatches today even suggested that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union were about to sign a military alliance, intending to threaten Britain and France to make concessions and accept peace. Fearing that the future would worsen significantly, people generally anticipated a potential decline in the US-British exchange rate, leading to a majority of speculators going long on the US dollar. Conversely, there was little interest in the British pound. The forward rate fluctuated slightly more than the spot rate, mainly because, in the afternoon, a telegraphic report denied the US Secretary of State's involvement in mediating European affairs. This strengthened the resolve of market participants, who mostly abandoned near-term positions and went long on far-term contracts.</p>
<p>The morning session initially eased</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London rates for both near and far terms narrowed by 1.25. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate against the British pound and the French franc remained flat. The exchange rate against Shanghai decreased by 0.0625. The US dollar continued to rise by 0.25 against the British pound, increased by 0.1 against Shanghai, and increased by 0.875 against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the morning opening, banks offered spot selling prices of 4s 1.40625d for British gold and $6.50 for the US dollar, with the British pound easing by 0.015625 and the US dollar firming by 0.03125 compared to the previous close. After the opening, Banque Belge d'Extrême-Orient (華比) and Chase Bank followed suit, and the market continued to ease. Banque Belge sold US dollars for the current month at $6.50 to a certain bank, and Chase Bank sold US dollars for the current month at $6.50 to Chinese merchants. Subsequently, buyers became more scarce, and the situation became even more relaxed. It was difficult to find a counterparty for US dollars at $6.53125 for the current month. When HSBC's listed exchange rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced to have decreased by 0.5%, Banque Belge suddenly re-entered the market at the original price, buying US dollars for the current month from other banks at $6.50. At the same time, Wah Hsing Bank (華行), Shanghai Bank and Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu (喬直甫), and a few speculators, also entered the market with higher bids, turning the trend firmer. The US dollar was once difficult to settle at $6.50. However, at that time, the current shilling was still at 4s 1.40625d. Suddenly, a telegraphic report came from Hong Kong offering to sell, and some Chinese merchants also sold, causing the market to ease again. Hong Kong Electric (港電) sold spot British gold to HSBC at 4s 1.5625d, and speculators sold US dollars for the current month to China Overseas Chinese Bank (華僑) at $6.53125. However, a certain bank resumed buying, absorbing US dollars for the current month from other banks at $6.50. It was also reported that a certain Chinese bank was also absorbing US dollars on behalf of Hong Kong businesses, causing the market to stabilize again. By the close, British gold remained at 4s 1.40625d, and the US dollar remained at $6.50, with no change compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>Speculation Resumes on Forward Contracts</p>
<p>The market initially opened at 4s 1.40625d and $6.50. Subsequently, due to telegraphic reports that the US Undersecretary of State Welles denied mediating European peace, general speculators were drawn back to go long on forward US dollars, causing the current US dollar to tighten slightly. Wah Hsing Bank bought US dollars for the next month from foreign banks at $6.375, more than $10 above the New York rate, and bought US dollars for the current month from foreign banks at $6.46875. At that time, the current US dollar could only be settled at $6.46875. Later, Chase Bank still showed interest in spot, so the current US dollar returned to flat. Forward contracts, however, remained soft. By the close, British gold was at 4s 1.40625d, the US dollar at $6.50, British gold for the current month at 4s 1.125d, the US dollar at $6.46875, British gold for the next month at 4s 1.0625d, and the US dollar at $6.34375. As a result, spot British pound eased by 0.015625 and the US dollar firmed by 0.03125 compared to the previous day. Futures for the current month saw British pound unchanged and US dollar decreasing by 0.03125. For the next month, both British and US exchange rates saw no change.</p>
<p>Hong Kong British-US Exchange Rate Stable</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 19th (Tuesday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat today. The current US dollar exchange rate was unchanged. The US currency spot rate eased by 0.125 to $23.3125. The forward rate eased by 0.1875 to $23.1875. The Shanghai exchange rate spot rate decreased by $1 to $357. The Japanese exchange rate spot rate increased by $1.5 to $99. At 10:15, the market reported flat. The Shanghai exchange rate spot rate rebounded by $0.5 to $357.5. At 11:09, the market was stable. The US dollar spot rate remained at the original level. The forward rate tightened by 0.0625 to $23.125. At 11:30, the market reported flat. All exchange rates saw no change. At the noon close, the US dollar spot rate tightened by 0.0625 to $13.25. The forward rate was unchanged. The market opened flat at 2:30 PM. All exchange rates saw no change.</p>
<p>Tianjin British Pound Decreases, US Dollar Unchanged</p>
<p>Tianjin, 19th (Tuesday) dispatch: The exchange market opened firm this morning. The British pound spot rate decreased by 0.03125 to 3s 8.4375d. The US dollar spot rate was unchanged, remaining at $6.03125. The Shanghai exchange rate increased by $0.5 to $107. The (Joint Note) unofficial market was unchanged at $101.</p>
<h3>European Situation Unstable, Gold Prices Easy to Rise, Difficult to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market situation for cash gold and the unofficial market showed a steep rise after a fall. It is not an exaggeration to say that gold prices are easy to rise but difficult to fall. After retreating from the $5,000 mark several times, it returned to it, mainly because the foreign exchange market first eased and then rebounded, and there was news that the US Undersecretary of State denied mediating the European war, causing the atmosphere of peace to fade abruptly. People's hearts were extremely unsettled. Initially, the exchange rate between the US and Britain soared, with the British pound flat and the US dollar easing. Therefore, sellers appeared after the opening. In particular, a certain securities firm, which had aggressively absorbed gold the previous day, suddenly sold, and the buying was no match. The price once fell to $4,970. Unexpectedly, "a certain bank" saw the low price and commissioned a securities firm to aggressively buy. At noon, the market turned from weak to firm. In the afternoon, that bank continued to buy, and the price rose sharply to $5,045. Finally, many retail investors sold, and the foreign exchange market stopped tightening and returned to flat, turning weak again. The market closed at $5,028, down only slightly by $2. The total trading volume for the day was about 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold also fell and then returned to flat, remaining at $510. Customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Only Decreased by Two Dollars</p>
<p>Since the morning, the exchange market initially eased, and sentiment was very low, with a chorus of selling voices. The market immediately fell by $30 per bar (10 taels). A gold shop released 50 taels from a silver shop for $5,000. Shortly after, in a competition among securities firms and gold shops, the price fell by another $18. A securities firm released 10 taels to a money exchange for $4,982. Subsequently, thanks to a sudden surge in buying from a certain bank, and at that time, the US dollar in the foreign exchange market turned soft, silver shops and gold shops also entered the market, and the price rebounded by $21. A money exchange released 30 taels from a silver shop for $5,003. However, because a certain securities firm sold again, selling more than 200 taels, the price was pressed down again by $18. A securities firm sold 20 taels to a gold shop for $4,985. After that, a certain money exchange suddenly came to aggressively buy, and the securities firm had no intention of selling, and the price rebounded by $20. A silver shop released 50 taels to a gold shop for $5,005. Soon, the exchange market eased again, and money exchanges and gold shops rushed to sell, while retail investors also sold, causing the price to fall again by $35. A money exchange released 30 taels to a securities firm for $4,970. Later, fortunately, a certain securities firm suddenly came to resume buying, and at that time, Hong Kong businesses were also searching for gold, and the foreign exchange market turned stable again, and the price rebounded by $45. A silver shop released 50 taels to a gold shop for $5,015. At noon, buyers gradually became scarce, and silver shops took the opportunity to sell at a high price, decreasing by $10. A silver shop released 10 taels to a gold shop for $5,005, making the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the market gradually became firm. The market opened $10 higher, with a silver shop buying 20 taels from a gold shop for $5,015. Subsequently, due to silver shops continuing to search for gold, the price increased by another $7, with a silver shop buying 30 taels from a securities firm for $5,022. Later, a jewelry shop sold, initially decreasing by $12, with silver shops trading 10 taels for $5,010. Afterwards, a certain securities firm resumed dragging in, and with the help of Hong Kong businesses, and with the exchange rate reported to be tightening, the price was raised by $35. A jewelry shop bought 50 taels from a silver shop for $5,045. After entering, another securities firm suddenly sold, and the current US dollar was reported to be firming, and buyers stopped buying, and the price fell by $19. A securities firm released 50 taels to a gold shop for $5,016. Later, thanks to a certain money exchange aggressively buying, the price rebounded again, rising by $12. A certain money exchange bought 50 taels from a securities firm for $5,028, making the evening closing price. As a result, the price was reduced by $2 compared to the previous day, with a fluctuation of $75 for the entire day. The selling price of the cash gold shop was several dollars higher than the standard price, and the purchase price was reduced by $20. The current standard gold was more than $50 lower than the listed gold. There were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Initially Decreased Slightly, Then Increased Significantly</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops was still $510. At 9:30, the price decreased by $5. At 3:35 PM, the price rebounded by $5. In the end, it was flat, with silver shops still selling at $510. The new silver shops were the same as the old silver shops. The purchase price was reduced by about $15.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Mixed Firm and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market showed that the US dollar was still fluctuating. In the morning, the British pound exchange rate rebounded very strongly. The US dollar in the black market continued to ease, causing the rate to fall to $15.13. Later, demand increased slightly, and the rate rebounded to $15.22 at noon. In the afternoon, there were sudden reports that the US Undersecretary of State would not participate in any European negotiations, and the British pound exchange rate would likely fall again. Generally nervous people rushed to buy again, and the rate suddenly rose to $15.30 after 3 o'clock, but then retreated to $15.26. British gold notes initially rose and then fell. The supply and demand for British pounds, US dollars, and Hong Kong notes were balanced. The trend for French franc notes and Philippine notes was weak. Only Singapore notes and Dutch notes suddenly had demand. Annam notes also had demand. Japanese gold notes were still advancing slowly, reaching $1.325 in the evening market. Korean notes were potentially stable. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold notes and Philippine notes decreased by 5 cents, US dollar notes decreased by 6 cents, French franc notes decreased by 1 cent, Singapore notes and Dutch notes increased by 30 cents, Annam notes also increased by 5 cents, and the rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities Public Bonds Sold at High Prices, Foreign Stocks Closed Lower</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market yesterday saw a slight stabilization due to the continuous rise in market prices in recent days. Class C bonds once rose to $49.60, but then fell back due to sales at high prices. Currently, the market price is still not easy to return quickly due to a lack of trading codes. Class E bonds once broke through the $9 mark, but then retreated. The trend should stabilize for a while, and sentiment is still very firm. Yesterday morning, in the buying by Lianyi, Daqing, Hongkang, etc., various bonds improved by 20-30 cents. Then, due to selling by Jiufeng, Lianhe, Xinfu, Tongshun, etc., the market weakened. Although Tongkang, Lemaochang, etc. still had demand, the market atmosphere felt weak. The noon market price was roughly the same as the previous day. In the afternoon, Xinfu, Jiufeng, and Changji continued to buy, Lianhe continued to sell, and Tongshun also turned from buying to selling. Other securities such as Tai Fung and Tiansheng were sold off. The price was stable and unchanged. As a result, the highs and lows were mixed, with a difference of only 5-10 cents. The trading volume was about 1 million dollars. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of the Shanghai Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of $44.50.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market situation at the Public Association: There was no market in the morning due to settlement. The market was very strong after the afternoon opening, so trading was quite active, and the price was still firm. Shanghai Bank and Jardine Matheson shares have recently been traded in large volumes at this new high price line of $135, as I predicted. Sellers were strong before the close, causing all shares to decline. The market was still weak at the close. However, there was no reason for the rise in selling. It was only whether there was hope for the realization of peace in Europe. Rubber shares remained weak for similar reasons.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Monday) dispatch: Today's London market for Chinese foreign debt showed mixed gains and losses. The Anglo-German Continued Loan (英發) and the Rehabilitation Loan (英發) each fell by £1, the former to £58 and the latter to £39. The Beining Railway Public Bond uniquely rose by £2 to £57. The rest were flat.</p>
<p>London, 18th (Monday) dispatch: Today's London market for stocks of British-owned Far East companies was generally stable. Only Kulakk Limpang Rubber shares uniquely fell by 7.5d to £20 7.5d. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grain Foreign Rice Plummets</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was still downstream, but the decline was not as drastic as before. Although the market opened early, guests observed, and floating hoarders continued to sell, and the price of each commodity fell by about $1.50. However, later, general guests saw that the original roots were not removed, and the prices seemed to have fallen through, so they took advantage of the low prices to make moves. Therefore, the situation in the afternoon gradually tightened, and the prices rebounded. However, they were about 50 cents to a dollar lower than the previous market. At the close, No. 1 Saigon was $38.5, No. 2 was $35, Special Siam was $37, No. 2 was $35.25, Fire Twisted was $36.5, $36, Small Twisted was $35.2, $35, Mixed Broken was $31.13, $31. The price of glutinous rice was already low, and seeing foreign rice showing hesitation, the cargo owners were unwilling to sell. As a result, the situation was flat and weak. National rice such as thick and thin japonica rice, early and late rice, which was transferred from Hongkou, gradually became popular. Yesterday, there were more than 2,000 bags. It was rumored that the unofficial market outside the market had weakened by nearly a dollar. The previous cargo from the city was not sampled, and there was no market.</p>
<p>After foreign rice plummeted for several consecutive days, it was further pressured by multiple factors such as incoming goods and warehouse rents. The market continued to look down. After yesterday's opening, the selling pressure increased, and the price of No. 1 Saigon in the general market fell to $37.56. Return cargo was devalued by floating households, and the market became more weak. The current foreign rice also fell by $1.23. Later, the actual sales once improved by $0.4. However, the return cargo of No. 1 Saigon was originally quoted at $48.5 and No. 2 at $44.5. There was a lack of buyers in the afternoon. In the morning, Small Twisted was $44. In the afternoon, it fell to $42.7, and sentiment was still depressed.</p>
<h3>Flour Flat Selling Period Expires, Factory Price Increases by $3.80</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of the current flour flat selling period. The factory price of No. 2 flour, after repeated consultations between the factory and the Public Works Bureau, was proposed to increase by $3.80 per bag, changing to a price of $13.80. After this decision, the flat selling event was implicitly cancelled. The authorities and all parties hoped to continue the low-priced flat selling. However, considering the current sharp fall in rice prices, the flour mill's increase was too rapid and large. It was heard that since the factory price had increased to $13.80, the factory could supply the local market as much as possible, so the return flour market was quite affected. It was heard that the old car brand eased to $14.10 and $14, the Fuxin brand was $13.75, the Tianzhu brand was $14, and the Japanese factory flour Double Lion brand was $13.65. The transaction volume was about 4,000-5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Wheat The market was still stable yesterday. Since the factory price of flour had increased to $13.80, the wheat price could not be too loose. After the Changxi wheat fell to $23.50, it gradually aroused the buying intentions of a certain factory. The Tongshi market sold more than 10 cars of Changzhou wheat at a price of $23.50-$23.70. The future market situation will depend on how the environment changes.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Oil Beans Fall Rapidly</h3>
<p>Due to the influence of the environment, sentiment in the miscellaneous grains and oil bean market was extremely chaotic. Buying and selling were still tight, and the market price fell again and again.</p>
<p>In the oil market, only the local market absorbed 180 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, and the price plummeted from $110 to $107, a sharp drop of $9 compared to the previous day's market. Dayou factory soybean oil also fell by $8, with 280 dan traded at $83. There were no other transactions.</p>
<p>In addition to the local market absorbing some, soybean was purchased by oil mills operated by Japanese merchants. The market price was reduced by 60-70 cents to about a dollar compared to the previous day's price. The Tongshi market sold more than 800 bags of Wuhu beans at a price of $21.60-$19.60, 300 bags of Nandong beans at a price of $20.08-$20, 100 bags of Zhunqiu beans at a price of $21.2, 1 car of Yangzhou beans at a price of $20.07, 200 bags of Dingjiazhou beans at a price of $21.56, and 50 bags of Chongmingshahuan at a price of $23.</p>
<p>The import and export of miscellaneous grains was quite active. On the 19th, 500 bags of beans came from Yantai. On the 2nd, 80 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, 60 bags to Singapore. 5,560 pieces of bean cake were shipped to Xiamen, 30 bags of raw peanuts were shipped to Singapore, and 250 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn General Public Sells Short April Futures, Yarn Market Plummets, Current Double Horse Falls by $21</h3>
<p>The yarn market was very weak, and the decline was particularly strong. This was because it was reported that there might be peace in Europe, and at the same time, overseas Indian and American cotton markets were declining. As a result, sentiment turned frustrated, and short sellers were active. The general public unanimously sold short April futures, causing the market to immediately lose its looseness and fall immediately. However, the major bulls were calm due to the factory shutdowns. The price of 20-count Double Horse April futures initially traded at $970, falling to $948. In the afternoon, it traded again at $954, but sales were still sustainable.</p>
<p>Current Yarn The opening was heard that the British and American exchange rates were rising, and there was a strong atmosphere of Zhou peace. Sellers were active, and the price of 20-count Double Horse for the current month was $960, a drop of $10 from the previous day. Later, with the US dollar continuing to rise, buyers were not strong, and the market became more depressed, falling to $948. Those who made profits in the middle covered their positions, and the price rebounded to $953-954. However, the short side was determined, and the price fell again to $938. The close slightly rebounded to $942. The transaction volume for half a day was 2,305 bags, and the current price of 20-count Double Horse fell by $21. Today, 80 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen. The amount of daily purchases by various gangs is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Cotton Prices Unanimously Decline</h3>
<p>There were fewer transactions for local cotton. This was because the Indian and American cotton markets turned downward, causing sentiment to soften and the market price to be slightly weak. However, inventory was getting thinner. For Su Bei origin, there were 581 bags of Tonghua. The transaction situation for current cotton is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another dispatch on foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was initially quiet. Later, due to selling by the Liverpool gang in the market, and the settlement of some multi-headed, the market was dull all day. As a result, the closing price was 2 pound sounds lower than the previous day for near-term contracts, and 5 pound sounds lower for far-term contracts. The Indian cotton market saw a sharp drop in cotton prices of 9 mixed rupees due to rumors of peace in the market. However, the forecast showed a slight improvement of 2 rupees. The Egyptian cotton market fell by more than 30 pound sounds.</p>
<p>Transactions of foreign cotton in Shanghai: The exchange rate rose slightly, but the market sentiment was still weak due to the continued decline in overseas cotton markets, so there was no improvement in transactions. The industry was indifferent, and the factories did not purchase raw cotton because of the low cotton prices. The development of transactions in recent days may be hopeless. The price of the cotton market yesterday, converted at a US dollar exchange rate of $6.50, is as follows:</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Raw White Arrives in Large Quantities, Continues to Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for raw sugar was weak due to increased arrivals, and the market continued to decline. The association's price list showed that the current price of 24 raw white sugar was $61 for the local warehouse, down $1, $61 for the newly arrived foreign warehouse, down 80 cents, $60.50-$60.30 for the old cargo, down $1.20, and $48 for the transfer, down 50 cents. The Taikoo car white sugar upper grades were also slightly weak. The B mark western warehouse was $67, down 10 cents, the eastern warehouse was $66.50, down 10 cents, the western warehouse CW mark was $66.50, the CX mark was $66, the DY mark was $65, and the HX was $64.50. The eastern warehouse had a decline of 50 cents for each grade. The H mark car red sugar only in the eastern warehouse had a decrease of 10 cents, at $44.70. Dutch red sugar was unchanged. Local cotton white sugar was down 50 cents. Snowflake white sugar was $61. Local rock sugar had the same decrease, with No. 1 at $73.5, No. 2 at $73, and Jingming ice at $75. The asking price for domestic sugar was the same as before, with no transactions.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Raw Peanuts are Tightly Priced</h3>
<p>According to communications from Qingdao, the spot price of raw peanuts is tight. 17,000 pieces have been handled by Western gangs and oil workshops at $37-$38. Peanuts are also popular. Wangtai raw peanuts are $26-$27, and Gaomi raw peanuts are even higher at $32. 2,500 bags have been handled.</p>
<h3>Metals Tinplate Prices are High and Sales are Stagnant</h3>
<p>The tinplate market, which has been good for a long time, saw a decrease in sales at various sales venues yesterday. Such as the local can factories, biscuit companies, and foreign gangs were afraid to purchase due to tight money and high prices. The business suddenly felt sluggish. However, the selling price was affected by the overseas pricing cost and did not soften. For example, 180-pound Italian double-linked iron box was sold for $190, 180-pound American double-linked iron box was sold for $195 per box, 200-pound positive American tinplate box was called $210. Only the asking price was heard, and there was no actual transaction.</p>
<p>Black iron billets were reported to be sold for $800 for 2,000 pounds and $78 for 200 pounds yesterday (Note: yesterday's publication was $830 for 2,000 pounds and $80 for 200 pounds, which is incorrect).</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Receives Telegram from Ministry of Finance to Suppress and Stabilize Prices and Stabilize the Exchange Market, Hoarding and Manipulation Have Not Been Stopped, Affecting People's Livelihoods, Quickly Determine Effective Measures to Implement on a Specific Date</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: To the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, According to reports, since the spring, the exchange market in Shanghai has fluctuated greatly, and the prices of goods in Shanghai have soared, exceeding the scope allowed by exchange rate changes. The price increases of rice and flour are particularly significant. The main reason is the manipulation of hoarders. It is necessary to find ways to prevent hoarding and manipulation, which will not only stabilize prices but also benefit the stabilization of the exchange market. It is hereby ordered to quickly discuss and determine effective measures and implement them effectively. Please also telegraph to the Ministry for verification. Special printed by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>The Shanghai French Municipal Council's Price Equalization Committee held its second general meeting on the 13th of this month. The three sub-committees submitted investigation reports with plans, requesting review and submission to the French Consul General for approval. It is heard that it will be announced and implemented soon. The three sub-committees have now submitted two reports, but their work has not stopped. They are continuing to investigate the market situation in order to obtain new factual basis.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Clearly Orders the Recall of Copper Coins, Punish Private Export, Extremely Strict Punishment Measures</h3>
<p>The various sizes of old and new copper coins previously issued in mainland China and the newly cast one-cent copper coins in recent years have been extremely scarce. The reason is due to the surge in demand for metals after the outbreak of the European War. The main reason is the lack of metals in Japan, which has been searching for them in every possible way, resulting in smugglers buying copper coins and smuggling them out of the country in large numbers. The copper coins and newly minted cent coins currently stored in China are very few. Each cent coin can make a bullet, and old copper coins with high composition are equal to cent coins. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has clearly ordered them to be recalled and no longer minted, and the Supplementary Coin Regulations have been revised to adjust the color and weight of the one-cent, two-cent, five-cent, and ten-cent auxiliary coins. The Central Bank and local banks are allowed to issue one-cent and five-cent coin notes to replace them. At the same time, the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Obstructing National Currency have also been revised. The first article states: "Anyone who intends to profit by smuggling copper coins for export shall be sentenced to death, life imprisonment, or imprisonment of not less than seven years," in order to strictly enforce the law and prevent abuses. It is also heard that private smuggling in the occupied areas is centered on Shanghai. In South China, they are smuggled out of the country from the Shantou, Haifeng area, transported to a certain place by small sailboats, and then transshipped to Japan.</p>
