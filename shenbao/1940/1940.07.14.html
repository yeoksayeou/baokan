<h3>法國變更政制</h3>
<p>年年今日，法國國民與法國友人無不興高采烈，祝賀法蘭西共和國革命紀念，建國國慶。</p>
<p>今年今日，法國纔開始實行獨裁政制，共和政府總統勒白侖氏在職被廢，參眾兩院亦旣注定了不日解散消滅的末運，貝當上將以內閣總理晋位元首而綜攬大權。</p>
<p>這不僅是大可歏息的變遷而已，差可先慰者：雖法國當時的革命，對於爾後一世紀半以來的人類文明，確有莫大貢獻，在人文歷史上畫成新時代而為極重要極光輝的一頁，故為超越國界而具有世界性的偉績，總之，影響天下後世者尤人宏遠；然法國目前這一次變廷，却是被動的追隨，是權宜的應付，其如何影響法國自身的前途，猶屬疑問，却不足以影響什任何他國。</p>
<p>十八世紀末期，一七八九年七月十四日，巴黎市民憤怒攻毀巴士蒂爾監獄，自此革命火燄高揚，推翻了波旁王朝，採行共和國體。事距今年今日整一百五十一年。史家論斷，認為法國革命的意義，不但它一國的國體變廷，並且（一）樹立了民主政治的典型，以成年男子普遍獲有選舉權而確立了主權在民的原則。（二）以民權的伸張，替代了君主臣民的國家組織觀念，而使民族意識普遍昂進。（三）人民思想廢除了檢察，擺脫了梏桎，使思想自由成為基本人權之一。（四）以法律規定各種宗敎敎徒的平等，亦即以法律保障了信仰自由。（五）摧毀了經濟的商業的封建制度，容許任何人以擇業的自由與平等。法國革命所創制所昭示的，當然不僅這五基；而對於這五項，在現代人視為當然的享有；苦飲水思源，不能不歸功於法國革命的成就，實為現代文明國家嚆矢。因此之故，吾們不禁深深地嚮往於當年的法國革命，不禁深深的感慨於今日的法國政變。</p>
<p>一七八九年以後，法國共和國體曾經一再中斷；拿破崙東征西討，立功減外，遂稱皇帝；路易十八世憑藉國際反法同盟的力量，恢復波旁王朝；其後，又有查理十世，有路易腓力；有拿破崙三世；當時皆有聲色，有作有為；總之到一八七〇年為止，國體再三翻復。穩定了七十年，現在對德交戰失敗，風雨飄搖，貝當上將毅然採行獨裁制；雖回溯七十年前事，變制並非破例，而獨裁元首當然亦有異於帝制自為，然所謂民治，所謂自由，殆將緲然不可復見。</p>
<p>據前晚貝當元首所昭告法國人民者，有云，政府有亟待辦理的巨大工作；又云，法國在被迫對德屈服的黑暗時期中，法國的苦難尙接踵而來；又云，此次戰爭已使國際資本主義及國際社會主義宣告崩潰，法國現已脫離各種暗無天日的條約及聯盟關係；但法國將以勇敢剛毅的精神，獨力改造法國國家及法國的生命。凡此宣示，頗堪耐味；更憶日前電傳，自貝當以次，公餘散步之際，每每淚痕不乾，愁容滿面，如此情景，尤堪同情，然不夠說明法國非改取獨裁政制不可的必要原因，亦不夠保證獨裁政制必得穩渡難關。</p>
<p>法國前內閣總理達拉第掌政多年，以多數黨為基礎而權力膨大，及至西綫戰局緊張，向議院要求更大權力不可得，乃宣告下野；吾人於是致疑於法國人士殆未翁然獨裁政制。貝當登臺於會儼然存在，議權在握的時候，當初出處程序旣達常例，而以內閣總理廢總統，稱元首，改政制，制新憲法，風行草偃，舉重若輕；吾人於是致疑於法國的民治神髓，早已消失。因此之故，凡在關愛法國者，旣祝望法國艱苦奮鬥終有成就，却又代為懦惴焉惟虞政制更張的從滋未來紛擾。改制前途的得失成敗，固難逆覩，但鑒彼民治神骨的早已消失，竊又以為成敗得失的無關政制；申言之，法國遭遇險惡，非可歸咎於民主政治。世局劇變，世人怵於現象，錯覺為政制短長，輒想模仿，這與扣槃捫燭何異？</p>

<p>重慶　（續昨）這一點日本是深深知道、而感到惶懼的、上面所說的、不過舉國際上最近很顯著的一個事例、以見日本行動所得反響的一斑、在我們中國則不然、因為中國問題就是亞洲問題、亦即是關系全世界安危問題、可以說全世界各國沒有不希望我們能取得勝利的各位看蘇俄以及其他各友邦報紙、昨天在我們「七七」抗戰紀念日、都特別著論贊揚、就可以知道我國三年抗戰、在世界上貢獻的偉大、以及與世界各友邦關系之重大了、不過各位同志要知道的、我們要增進世界同情、最重要的問題、完全在我們自己、我們自己能自立自強、纔值得友好各國的重視、也纔是我們勝利的最大保障、而且我們真能自立自強、自給自足、則抗戰勝利纔沒有問題、大家試看這十餘年來的新興各國、他們是如何的勵精圖治、刻苦自奮、可見任何國家只要能自立自強、無論怎樣惡劣環境、都可以轉強為強、轉危為安、否則縰令你有怎樣好的環境和憑藉、也必致辜負了天賦優厚的條件、而終至於敗亡的、世界上絕對沒有不能自立的國家、可以依賴外力而存在、亦沒有不能自強的民族、依賴外力而能生存的、我們觀察世局　應當　此等地方着眼、更應當借鏡於他山之石、而格外的努力、關於日人外交軍事政治經濟等情形、我在七七抗戰紀念日發表文件、已有詳盡的說明、日人現在不僅是外交上完全陷於絕境、毫無出路、他想拉攏誰、誰也不願和他結合、他想威嚇誰、誰也不會受他威嚇、他現在真是困難重重、而最大的問題、就是人力的問題、日本的人口不過我們六分之一、經過我們三年抗戰的消耗早已感到萬分竭蹶、加以國內天災人禍、層出不窮、所以日人現在眞已到了勢窮力竭、快要最后崩潰的階段、他現在還要顗覦安南和南洋、眞是大不自量　我們可以說、即使他侵佔了安南和南洋、其結果亦只是增加他的禍患、自速減亡而已、我這次所最感到安慰的、就是在這樣酷暑大熱的天氣之中、又遭連日的狂炸、而我們到會各同志精神這樣發奮、工作如此努力、先後八天、自始至終、毫不鬆懈、這眞是我們抗戰前途最後勝利必然到來的徵兆、我們革命黨就應該有這種精神、日機儘管連續的來濫肆、今天三點鐘在此地周圍投擲了這樣一千磅的大炸彈、而我們到四點鐘仍在轟炸的地點照常開會、一個人也沒有缺席、可見我們革命的精神實在是愈磨礪而愈堅強、愈艱苦而愈振奮、尤其是日人發動濫炸、已將兩個多月了、我們民眾遭受了這樣殘酷的威脅、而毫不恐怖、只有更沉着、更奮勇、一切都是照常的埋頭工作、眞是行所無事、我們又看到一般兒童青年、在防空洞內唱歌服務、侍候他們的父母長老的情形、更是可愛、我們的同胞能夠如此、</p>
<p>英勇鎮定忍苦耐艱、實在使我們感奮而惕勵、我們經過三年來全國軍民如許重大的犧牲、而社會民心愈戰愈奮、歷久彌堅、這種效果、可以說完全是由於我們總理主義的感召、也就是證明我們的三民主義已經深入全國人心、所以能使全國同胞、無論男女老幼、一天比一天奮興、政府與人民相團結一天比一天密切、我們有了這樣偉大的革命主義、有了這樣優良的民族精神、我們一般負領導責任的中央同志、更應該如何一致努力、以期無負於我們的總理、無愧於我們全國的同胞、大家要曉得、我們經過了三年的血戰、我們眞是增加無限的自信、如果我們這樣堅苦卓絕的民族、還不能獨立生存於世界、那末世界上還有那一個民族可以獨立、可以生存、我們明白日我的情形、更可以知道我們眞是愈戰愈強、抗戰的最後勝利、決沒有不操在我們中國手裏的各位同志、</p>
<p>必須注意　論到當前的形勢、固然於我們抗戰只見得有利、但我們應時時準備着最嚴重最困難時期的到來、因為任何專業、尤其是革命建國的事業、當其愈接近最後成功的階段、必定是會遇到最困苦和最艱難的一着、這是一定的道理、譬如我們把金屬煉成純鋼、非至火力達到最猛烈最高度的時候、則精純堅強的真鋼是不能煉成的、所以我們要抗戰勝利、要民族復興、也必須經過這最高度的困難、</p>
<p>纔能成功　正如天色將曙、黎明將至以前、必然要經過一度極端黑暗的時間、而後無限的光明就從此中湧現而出、我們斷不可說抗戰三年、并沒有遇到十分艱難、就以為以後亦不會有什麼困難了、我們正應該及時磨厲以須、準備以最堅忍最剛強的努力、渡過必然到來的極端困難的時期、克服任何障碍、衝破任何艱危、乃能獲得最後勝利光明之路、我們同志又須知道我們抗戰、完全是三民主義的力量、而本黨更應自任為冒險犯難的先驅、今後抗戰的勝敗、國家的存亡、完全是本黨的責任、各位同志、大家要把黨的生命、看成自己的生命、要抱定黨亡與亡、</p>
<p>黨存與存　的決心、把個人的安危生死榮辱禍福一切放託付於黨、服從黨的命令、恪守黨的紀律、只要大家能發揚黨德、執行黨的命令、實行黨的決議、那我們的國家民族、一定可以獨立生存、抗戰建國一定可以獲得最後成功、尤其是此次遠道而來的各位同志、在各地黨政軍各方面負有責任的、更要本此精神、切實努力、并將此次會議的精神和重要決議、在前方後方各省區廣為宣達、激勵黨員、督促部下、動導同胞同心一德、各盡職責、完成我們的抗戰革命工作、我們過去三年的血戰、犧牲無數同志同胞、奠立了這個必勝的基礎、我們必須追念先烈為國成仁的忠勇、省察後死責任的重大、對着當前的環境、加緊奮鬥、那我們的光明和勝利、即在目前、深望我全黨同志和全國同胞、共同努力、不惜犧牲、來完成革命建國的使命、達到我們實現三民主義的目的（十二日電）</p>

<p>重慶　據可靠方面得悉、中國政府為目下所傳英日間關於經過緬甸運輸問題所進行之談判、曾一再通知英政府表示深切關懷、中國官方重視下一事實、即中國有權要求緬甸道路應繼續為國際運輸而開放、自中國民眾方面視之、緬甸道路昔為中國可利用之數國際路綫之一、故該路綫之維持、對中英兩國友好關係之繼續、極為重要云、（十三日電）</p>
<p>重慶　據國民政府某高級官員稱、東京所傳英國對香港緬甸與中國交通事之談判、似有與日本妥協之象、華人各界聞之甚為詫異、日本實無干涉此之權、英國對國際公法國聯決議案及大國應享之榮譽、責當拒絕日本所提出封閉路綫之要求、英國迄今屢次聲明彼之遼東外交政策未有更變、決不作有損中國之舉動、渠信今日之英內閣決不再鑄九一八事變發生時之大錯、據可靠消息、日本迫於經濟與其他困難、決計不與他國啟釁、今唯圖在外交上逞強、以　不遭武力抵抗、安然達其目的、中國政界希望獲得英國方面安慰人心之消息、以使局勢明朗、并矯正因東京消息引起之錯誤印象云、（十三日路透電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　羅斯福總統雖不赴芝加哥參加全國民主黨大會、但無人疑及大會處於其勢力之下、羅總統將目華盛頓遙制一切、羅總統將在政治史上爲一保守其第三期聯任意志的秘密之政治家、但大會開幕之前夕、卒以含蒂而暴露之、　羅總統今若拒絕競選、則將爲民主黨之巨厄、而使其運動陷於混亂中、十一月間選舉時之遭失敗、或可豫必、羅總統甚至對其家庭亦未將其意志微作暗示、　已使民主黨其他抱總統期望者失其競選機會、故集於芝加哥之諸領袖微覺不安、殊需作一宣布、表示羅斯福復擬競選、俾振全黨之精神、而使共和黨頗佔勢力之競爭者無獲勝之機會、羅總統最近對門羅主義發表之言論、不管使孤立派參議員韋勒任領袖之可能的第三「和平」黨中一魚雷、羅總統更近又發表不遣軍隊赴歐之誓言、此已使共和黨等謀以好戰者之名號加於羅氏之種種努力、悉歸失敗矣、（十三日路透社電）</p>

<h3>美記者一封信　揭露法國戰敗原因　末斯河一役不戰而退爲致命傷　遷都海外之議賴伐爾反對最力</h3>
<p>紐約　昨此間接獲美記者某君來函、內述德機械化部隊如何使法軍敗績、及現在法副總理賴伐爾如何阻止法政府遷移北非等情、皆歴歴如繪、自德軍衝過末斯河以迄於法德締結停戰協定、該記者均親見目擊、茲將該函録下、「法軍之突然破敗、誠爲一非常可驚之事、但回顧前事、予已察知希特勒恐早已明悉法軍不能擊退強大之德軍、事之轉捩點、乃在於德軍渡過末斯河之時、所謂「迂回戰」之成就、不特法人爲之驚奇、即德人自身亦何獨不然、德軍之從事此種「迂回戰」、原非視爲主要之戰爭、其目的係在迫令法軍調返其在比境作戰之軍隊、顯圖衝破該處陣地（指末斯河）之心、德軍之攻末斯河防軍、僅調用機械化師半師、計軍士六千人·坦克車二百輛·其他兵車一千五百輛、是時之德軍似祇爲測騐該地之軍力、比抵該河、發見法軍已放棄各完好之橋樑而退、於是德軍遂令坦克車過橋、而將橋堍之陣綫展闊、十二小時後、英航空員雖駕飛機向該河之各橋樑大肆轟炸、但爲時已晚、因法軍是時業已敗退、而德軍可於該河之上架設浮橋矣、斯時局勢乃急轉直下、而德軍之坦克車遂立即向拉翁及索亞松長驅而進、記者當時曾在某陸軍司令部、並曾聞德軍業已衝破法軍陣綫之謠傳、雖當時一般承認防守末斯河綫之法軍二師殊爲拙劣、且大部分爲巴黎人民、然尚無一人相信德軍衝破陣綫之可能、（按該兩師法軍其中半數均爲在後方忙於春耕及在製糖工廠工作者）其後於阻止索美河南德摩托化隊之進展、似應較爲容易、然多數之戰具均於自比境撤退時遺落、以致軍火槍砲皆感不敷應用、以來復槍及機關槍射擊坦克車、不啻以遲鈍之弓箭射擊　魚、試問能有效呼、法國政府遷都之一幕、亦非常令人納悶、主張先遷至都爾後又遷至波爾多之政治家中、賴伐爾爲坡主要之人物、是時其他諸人皆主張遷移至非洲、而賴伐爾獨以爲不可、仍欲法國政府留居法國境內、此久已聞名之主張法義合作者賴伐爾、於是召集參衆兩院議員往見總統勒白倫、是時賴伐爾之言動竟能左右一切、賴伐爾指陳、渠以爲法國之領袖一旦出走、結果必致數千萬法國人民咸皆受制於德人、生殺唯德人之命是聽矣、賴氏此種主張居然有效、而使許多政府人員益信留居法國之合理、賴氏並警告各閣員、謂彼始終不離法國、戰後賴氏並主張議會懲罰一切逃避之議員、因當時已有議員二十五人離開法國」云、（十三日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>美國民主黨大會前夕　羅斯福態度微妙</h3>
<p>歐洲數月來的劇變，有沒有把羅斯福總統不願三次連任的意思打銷？羅斯福總統對於三次連任何問題，直到民主黨在芝加哥舉行全國代表大會的前夕，還保持着緘默，是何作用呢？</p>
<p>羅斯福如果決定參加競選，那末，強之使然的，並不是他的左右人物，而是他的敵黨。他這種態度已經收了兩種成效：他已使各大城市區黨部「大亨」不再擁護黨主席法萊（現任郵務部長），並已使民主黨內的反動派無法抬頭。換句話說，羅斯福業已佈置就緒，此後大可進退自如了。</p>
<p>法萊宣布參加提名競選，就他的地位看來，原是一種離奇的冒險舉動。他決定與羅斯福分庭抗議，想來他自信有當選的相當把握。但是他在某種觀點上恐不免錯誤。這就是當局者迷：他以黨主席的地位對於黨部所享有的控制力，一旦為自己而不為真正的領袖利用時，便會在無形中失去的。</p>
<p>羅斯福曾經明白表示，他對於法萊或任何參加競選都不反對，但是任何人不能利用黨部以圖自便。</p>
<p>所謂各區黨部的「大亨」就是芝加哥的愛德華凱萊和傑賽城的佛朗克海格等人。由他們以民意為重黨部為輕的意思，去警告法萊和黨的反動派，確是非常有趣的一件事。各區黨部的大亨原是統制一切，而不是仰人鼻息的。他們居然接受民意，起來擁護羅斯福，反對法萊，那末民主黨內權威何在，已可不言而喻了。這種奮鬥的成績，在威斯康辛和伊利諾兩州預選時，各代表一致擁護羅斯福，反對法萊和副總統賈納，又已證明不誤。</p>
<p>羅斯福這種佈置既已完成，深知自己的政策，繼承有人，最後宣布倦勤，美國在國際關係上的力量，就不致受到不利的影響了。他或者還可控制民主黨全國代表大會，決定繼任人選，換句話說，可以使新政派，而非南部的保守派或中西部的孤立派當選。</p>
<p>這種人選，在共和黨大會未提出總統候選人之前，原在觀望之中。照原來計劃，共和黨如推定紐約地方法院檢察官杜威，那末，民主黨方面將以內政部長伊克斯或紐約市長賴加第與之競爭。共和黨如推舉參議員塔虎脫或范登堡，那末，民主黨方面預備以參議員華萊斯與之為敵。共和黨現巳推出一位“Dark　Horso”威爾基來了，那末，民主黨方面的原來計劃自必為之推翻。</p>
<p>要之，美國選舉形勢還须視國外局勢是否比內政重要以為轉移。目下美國內政校之國外時局，既如國務卿赫爾所謂，不可比擬，羅斯福總統又已大權在握，他的「是與否」，真有一言九鼎的力量。</p>

<h3>歐戰的代價</h3>

<h3>日報露骨言和　承認中國戰鬥力　婉曲解釋中日和戰利害　深知局部言和於事無補</h3>
<p>中日戰事、業已三年、吾人回溯既往、試就中日雙方對戰爭態度作一比較、產測心理、即登事實，實為一意味深長而富有興趣之事、日本發動侵華戰事以來、最初狂呼「三月亡華」、繼之又稱「百年戰爭」、其間且有「必須戰至中國屈膝」之豪語、切齒之聲、儼若可聞、但近半年中洋洋盈耳者、已一易而為「結束對華戰事」、返顧中國、「抗戰到底」、唯此四字、錚然鏗然、始終不變、此中隱秘、蓋不難窺測也、最近日方倦怠之感愈深、求和之心益切、初尚吞吐其詞、薪至日趨露骨、香港方面、由日人主辦之英文機關報「香港日報」（Hong　Kong　News）於六月三十日、會刊一文、求和之態、如見肺腑、此文一出、引起中外人士極大注目、尤以文中一點、以巧妙之措詞、直認與某方講和、無補於「中日合作、」實不營日方一公開坦白之供狀、在日方此種焦灼徬徨之狀態下、勝敗之數、其理甚明、中國當何去何從、毋待辭費矣、「香港日報」之文概錄如次、</p>
<p>空談勝敗</p>
<p>重慶政治家對於南京與東京、行將開始談判之和平、頗多曲解、彼等認為中日和平關係之恢復、實係羞恥、而必須加以規避之事、此種「愚蠢」之見解、乃因彼等未能明瞭真理之見解、世無永遠繼續之戰爭、一切戰爭之結果、必為和平、在重慶政府與日本之戰爭中、固已「慘敗」、但此絕非中國光榮史上之污點、良以既有戰爭、非敗即勝也、</p>
<p>婉轉陳詞</p>
<p>戰爭一事、實如一大規模之運動會、勝負固不足重視、所要者、失敗者能不失其運動精神耳、往者已矣、來者可追、吾人不應以昔日之錯誤、阻礙前途之發展、重慶當局、認識事實、此其時矣、</p>
<p>揄揚華軍</p>
<p>中日和平為挽救中國之唯一辦法、被擊敗非即懦弱之謂、中國人民及其戰爭力量、並無不良之特質、荀能在此時恢復「理智」、則亡羊補牢、尚不為晚、吾人應以此次戰爭作為一種寶貴之經驗、並可循此繼續邁進、</p>
<p>蘄求合作</p>
<p>誠然、荀日本之戰爭目標為征服中國、則重慶自當繼續抗戰、惟日本已屢次宣述其正大光明之目標、近衛已向中國保證日方決不以征服者自居、在近衛之原則下、和平決不危害中國之「獨立」、中國人民、仍得享受「自由」、但日方建議荀重慶方面不「參加」、則中國仍處於「分裂」、中國之「分裂」決無補中日合作、日本決不願有「分裂」的中國、</p>
<h3>今日法國國慶　停止儀式　僅懸旗誌慶　嚴肅中渡過</h3>
<p>今日為法國民主共和紀念日、旅滬法國僑民、本年以情形與往年迥異、絕不鋪張、僅懸旗誌慶、即大使館領事館暨各捕房門首之燈彩、亦無形取銷、故今日之國慶紀念、將從嚴肅與寂靜中渡過、微聞法大使戈斯默夫婦、將在海格路私邸招待園會、法大使館法總領事館法公董局法警務處等、均於今日休假一天、惟今日適為星期日、循例休假、明日將補假一天、於星期二照常辦公、</p>

<p>美兵禁止穿着便衣</p>

<p>泅水</p>
<p>子產有言曰：「水懦弱，民　而玩之，故多死也。」此特取譬之言耳，然至理實不外此。諺云：「水火無情。」水與火初不分別言之，蓋以火之能死人，人咸知之，水之能死人，人或未知，而實則水之無情，較火為尤甚。火之焚也，或可以逃避，而大水汎濫，逃避無方，而人顧不知懼，是亦可笑之甚矣。近來屢閱日報，見因泅水而斃命者，不一而足，故特為呼而覺之。夫以浴沂詠歸，賢者不免，如當此酷暑之時，必鰓鰓焉，欲當世共守處必掩身暑毋塞裳之戒，是直迂腐之談矣國。然而入水浴身，亦自有法，凡報中所載泅水而死者，皆自有取死之道，非水之必能死人也。能鳬水者，每欲自逞其能，當其初入水時，憑一勇之氣，不難浮沉，而岸上觀者，同聲喝彩，於是更竭其力，以博閱者之一贊，而不自揣其力之已盡，猶欲勉强支持，抑知正氣一虛，本力已薄，而水之力愈大，遂致有性命之憂，說者謂其中有鬼物為之索替，故至於死，而不知非也。</p>

<h3>金融　外匯供求平衡</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况滙豐掛牌揭曉、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、買賣適足相抵、變動範圍較小、市象可稱平凡、晨初以滙兌吿回長五分之多、開後以迄收盤、終呈英緊美鬆之狀、而交易以美滙居多、始因華行及投機商均吐塞、但均爲外行等吸收、嗣有洋行結款、頭寸似稍感不敷、更聞日高銀行扒英金約二十萬元（難證實）、故七月份美滙微軟〇三一二五、收盤結果英金三辦士八九〇六二五、美滙六元、較上日英緊〇一五六　五、美反硬〇六二五、期貨走勢亦然、</p>

<h3>多空意興闌珊金市呆定</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、毫無精彩、乃起伏轉狹、走勢呆定、因經營者多作審愼觀察、買賣興趣不濃故也、初開爲五千三百八十元、後銀號帮首來售出、再挫四十元、時聞外滙報硬、但不久滙市微又回歡、略動買風、金號證券帮購進爲多、抬至五千四百二十元、後以錢兌業乘貴賣出、價曾再進五千四百元關內、收盤卒吿五千四百十元、較上日僅小五元、午後週六無市、半天交易約一千數百兩、銀樓飾金先跌、旋卽回平、海關金等呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤軋小五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以滙兌報長、美滙告鬆、開時人心疲軟、卽被撳壓三十五元、金號出銀號二十兩、爲五千三百八十元、嗣因銀號金號競吐、又跌四十元、金號出銀號二十兩、遜爲五千三百四十元、旋外滙回緊、激動買風、證券帮與某金號吃胃陡濃、不久回漲八十元、金號進銀號二十元、升爲五千四百二十元、此後匯市復吿走鬆、錢兌業及散戶等吐出、重又撳小四十元、證券帮出金號三十兩、退爲五千三百八十元、午刻因人心尙佳、金號及銀號帮乘低撈進、再又回高三十元、金號進銀　十兩、爲五千四百十元作午收價、結果比上日軋小五元、半天八十元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金先跌後平</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百六十元、迨九時四十分掛小十元、十時三刻回高十元、此後則未更動、結果大同行依然懸五百六十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>美鈔變動狹隘</h3>
<p>昨外幣市况、烚赤起落不定、卒吿微跌、英美金鎊共求尙均、市價終趨平穩、英金票亦鮮變動、美金票動盪不定、惟起落範圍茶狹、卒吿微漲七分、香港票稍有需要、市價略漲二分、日金票需要又殷、晚市復高至一元二角一分、比上日計漲一分半、朝鮮票供求均勻、市價站穩、晚市仍爲九角八分、</p>

<h3>糧餘　米價平穩　洋米續到八千包</h3>
<p>洋米市自前朝再度猛跌後、昨晨開市、已能引起本鄕店胃乘廉活動、當時形勢因殊栗落、客販喊聲隨之而起、各色洋米行情曾較前收價提增元許、若一號陳西貢售六十一元二負、六十一元、二號五十八元、火紋六十元、但終以久疲之後人心不堅、一遇價高、卽復停手、致市面又起變化、轉呈軟色、於是各價節節回低、直至收市、未稍抬頭、計收價均恢復原盤、無甚榮辱、若一號陳西貢仍爲六十元零五角六十元二號五下七元半五十七元、</p>
<p>昨日洋米期貨略挫三四角、交易不多、回籠貨僅做開六月二十號裝暹邏二號米七十五噸價六十八元八角至五負、又六月二十六號裝一百噸價六十七元七角至八元半、本月十一日裝西貢二號米價六十六元、聞集團定米亦有六千噸將訂妥云</p>
<p>洋米賡續到滬、太古公司海日輪前日傍晚抵滬、自港裝來七千九百零五包、停靠浦柬該行碼頭、昨晨開始起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>糯米去路依然不廣、然以貨稀貨主不再輕脫、遂呈定局、開價與前收價、金溧白元仍爲六十五元、常丹貨六十三四元、香港白元六十五元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、來源祇六七百包、塲外暗盤、傳聞因洋米早市回昂、貨主均亦堅持、喊聲並高、但後勢轉市移、卒未獲願、結果遂皆以定局見稱、未有軒輊、常幫特淸粳七十元、蘇崑常州粳六十七八元、决至宿六十四五元、靑泗薄稻六十八九元、南港早稻六十五六元云云、</p>
<h3>金融述評　—七月十三日止—</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>日系通貨的膨脹</p>
<p>日系通貨的數量，依照六月底的數字看來、差不多是六十萬萬元、有九個之多的圈底數字、先就日本的紙幣發行講在中日戰事發生之後、日本銀行的發行額一九三七——三九這兩年問每年的增五萬萬元、而三九——四〇年的一年開增加則約十萬萬元、顯見得是激急的向上進展、而就日本銀行·朝鮮銀行·台灣銀行三行的合計看來、三七——三九兩年間每年的增六萬萬元、三九——四〇年約增十二萬萬元、假如以一九三七年作爲一〇〇、則三八年是一三〇、三九年是一六〇、四〇年是二二五、可見在去年六月至今年六月止日本紙幣發行數額的的賬、無怪日本金融界視爲「赤色警號」了、附三行每年六月底的發行數（單位百萬日元）、</p>
<p>四〇年　三九年　三八年　三七年</p>
<p>日本銀行　三、五九七　二、五二二　二、〇七四　一、六四〇</p>
<p>朝鮮銀行　四三七　二八五　二五四　一五一</p>
<p>台灣銀行　一七六　一四六　一〇五　七五</p>
<p>合計　四、二一一　二、九五四　二、四三三　一、八六七</p>
<p>日本政府劉於日本銀行紙幣的膨脹情形、向來諱莫如深、每當發行額超過金準備與保證準備底總和時、便以擴充保證準備數額以資彌補、但是保證準備一再由五萬萬允擴張到念二萬萬元後、仍見限外發行同時保證準備卽是政府公債、公債與紙幣、實是二五一十之分、紙幣信用的搖曳是必然的結果</p>
<p>因此除膨脹朝·台·兩銀行的發行外、在以戰養戰和開發佔領區的方針下、努力於日元集團通貨的膨脹、同時在華中一帶避免日元的膨脹起見、發行軍用手票、用以替代、</p>
<p>由上所述、日本三銀行的合計在今年六月底雖是四、二一一百萬元、可是日系通貨的總和遠超過這數之上、故這數字上還要加入其他日系通貨十二萬四千九百萬元、試爲之分析如下、</p>
<p>首先提出的是「滿洲中央銀行」、在今年六月二十五日的發行數是六萬三千四百萬元、在六月底是六萬三千萬元、前一數比較五月份是的增一千六百萬元、但比較去年六月份則增加了二四六、一一三、〇〇〇元、其决是「聯合準備銀行」在今年六月底的發行數是五萬五千八百萬元、比較去年十二月底的增一萬萬元、更决是「蒙疆銀行」在今年六月底是六千一百萬元、比較去年底的增六百萬元、比較去年六月底的增二千八百萬元、這一種膨脹的程度眞是迅速得可怕、</p>
<p>上面這六個銀行發行的總和是五十四萬六千萬元、但還不是日系通貨的正確數額、我門再加入一九三九年四月整理舊銀行券而獲得的四千萬元、和同年五月因朝鮮·台灣兩行擴張保證準備限度而放出的日本銀行紙幣的七干萬元、（這是日本銀行紙幣用以充朝·台兩行底發行準備的）、以及小額幣券二萬六千萬（今年五月底數字）、再加華中華南所行使的軍用手票估計二萬萬元（按有估計一萬萬元的）、這四數合計是五萬七千萬元、如此日系通貨的總和是六、〇一〇、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元、眞是一個龐大的數字</p>
<p>硬提「聯鈔」的價値</p>
<p>日人在華北用以操縱的工具——「聯合準備銀行」的鈔票、因爲監發的結果、它的人爲的價値、遠在上海法幣之下、可是「聯鈔」是與日元平掉而連系的、因之影響日遠的價値、同樣下落、日人想出種種方法以維持「聯鈔」、但是在過度膨脹的情形下、它的價値仍是低落得多、廣泛的華北仍信用法幣是法定通貨、以前的天津英租界亦不承認「聯鈔」有法定通貨的力量、但在六月十九日天津租界協定中之通貨協定「英工部局對聯合準備銀行鈔票、不得有任何阻碍」成立後、對於提高「聯鈔」價値的工作、便接踵而來、先是六月二十六日加强華北進口貿易統制、繼之以七月十日實施限制華北正金·朝鮮兩銀行底放款、辦法是、</p>
<p>加强進口統制的內容、（一）凡訂購由日本及滿洲以外地域（如第三國及華中華南等）輸入而有　聯銀供給外滙的貨物、必須預先取得「聯銀」所給的「定貨認可證明書」、但關於小麥·麵粉·米·粟·高梁·玉米六種糧食底輸入暫時不必經過上項承認、（二）凡山日本滿洲第三國及華中華南輸入貨物、不必山「聯銀」供給外滙的、必須預先取得海關監督斯發給的「無滙兌進口許可書」、否則不得報關進口、按華北的進口統制、一九三九年三月二日以後、卽行實施、常時規定進口商品計四十二類、去年七月六日又增加爲九十五類、卽以「聯銀」所收購的出口外滙除去百分之十作爲尋常滙款之餘額以爲支配、不過對於「聯銀」不供給外滙的進口和用法幣淸償的進口、因租界的關係、未能統制、現在租界已在日人控制之中、故對向未統制的、亟亟的加以統制、</p>
<p>此法實行之後、如無「定貨認可證明書」或「無滙兌進口許可書」、便不能進口、則在第三國及華中華南對華北的輸出、自然禁絕、結果足以减少華北方面對於法幣的需要、向來用聯鈔套買法幣的數量可以减少、以逐漸削除聯鈔價値依附法幣而生存的連繫、謀聯鈔價値的獨立與强華、</p>
<p>可是「聯鈔」在六月底已發行到五五八、〇〇〇、〇〇〇元、像這樣的膨脹、它的價値怎得不跌、單靠强化進口統制是不易收效的、所以日當局再於七月十日起禁限正金·朝鮮兩銀行放款、規定設備資金貸款在五十萬以下須得駐北京目本財務官許可、此數以上須得大藏省許可、五萬元未滿的要報吿財務官、設備資金以外的貸軟在十萬到五十萬元的須得財務官許可、五十萬元以上的須大藏省許可、而五萬元到十萬元的要報吿財務官、限制放款卽是禁止「聯鈔」的流入市塲、而免得因膨脹而使價値下落、</p>
<p>近來「聯鈔」的價値已由六月十九日的一〇〇·五貴到二十二日的九四·〇〇、但後來疲落到九九·〇〇、七月五日則又升至九十元左右、木週仍疲落到九十四元左右、上述數字是華北法幣百元合「聯銷」數　可見它的價値波動得很利害、將來如何雖不可料、但從它發行上看來、自一九三八年「聯銀」設立以後、「聯鈔」每半年約增發一萬萬元、則今後的發行若繼續這個軌跡、它的價値、恐怕不能提高或維持下去吧（未完）</p>

<h3>右圖係法國眞德女會於百年戰爭時鼓勵士氣擊退英軍</h3>
<h3>今年今日的法國</h3>
<p>一七八九年法蘭西大革命曾經震動了全世界，何等轟轟烈烈。它所揭　的自由，平等，博愛三種口號，至今仍爲人們所嚮往。想不到百五十年後的今年今日民主紀念情形有這樣的悲慘。訓練精勁的陸軍旣被世讐的德國打得一敗塗地，居於歐洲第二位的强大海軍竟也給一個月前的同盟國揮淚斬獲了一大部份。就是在政治上也巳廢止民治實行獨裁，難道說今年今日的民主紀念已是其最後一遭？這種變遷，或者眞如法國新獨裁者貝當上將所宣佈，在國難期中，爭取光榮的和平，獨力再造法國，不得不然的緊急措置？</p>
<p>種種變幻，宛如一塲大夢，除寄以同情外，別無可說。只是法蘭西本部的錦繡河山，卽使有一部份正被德軍佔領着，要仍値得一顧罷。</p>
<p>法國在大體上只好算是一個農業國；就風土人情說，她是一個最複雜的國家，各處的本地風光都很可愛。東部叫做勃艮第，平坦的山地伸展到萊茵流域。其地多麥田與葡萄塲。北部是法蘭德斯平原，爲自古以來用兵之地，生存著的樹木屈指可數。西北部是諾曼第，一片綠野，物產豐富居民勇敢善戰，一〇六六年征服英國的威廉公卽出其地。西部爲布勒塔尼，臨大西洋之濱，方言粗濁，居民仍抱獨立的思想。東南部則有阿爾卑斯山，亘延　百哩，終年積雪，乃地中海岸之蔚藍海濱各川流所自出。南部爲布羅溫斯，橄欖樹與橘樹所在多有。此外尙有巴斯格也，加斯科尼也，奧汾湼也，在今日的地圖上雖不易見，但各地居民仍保持其固有的特性。不過法蘭西統一的歷史已把他們統統薰陶成爲法國人，正如美利堅合衆國把各種移民薰陶成爲美國人一樣</p>
<h3>紐約博覽會紀盛E．L．（完續）</h3>
<p>會塲綜述</p>
<p>會塲大別分爲兩部，已如前述。在陳列的一部中，又可分爲政府·生活·食物·交通·運輸與生產五大門。娛樂塲中百戲雜陳，又可分爲水陸兩門。</p>
<p>會塲的佈置，全塲略作長方形，北部的佔全塲三分之二的地位爲陳列塲，南部爲娛樂塲。陳列塲中各種建築都很富麗，或以性質來標榜，或以國籍來分別。這一部的中心建築爲一個很大的「圓球」和一個聳立着的一高碑一，從空中瞭望，十分顯著。「圓球」表示國際，「高碑」象徵美國的獨立自由。在這中心標識之東，爲「國際湖礁」及「和平廣塲」；其西爲市政廳廣塲和紐約市的陳列館</p>
<p>娛樂塲卽號稱爲「大白路」的，在「自由湖」之東區，沿湖建築極多，可分爲戲劇·音樂·運動·動物國·雜耍等各門，入晚流星四射，反映湖光，非常美麗。這個娛樂的總滙爲今年的特色，可稱爲全世界最大的遊藝塲了。</p>
<p>由空中作鳥瞰，會塲又像一把張開的彩色扇子，放在幅員三英里的廣塲上。拿性質來分，可成爲實業展覽區，政府與外國展覽區，及娛樂區。在「圓球」「高碑」和「國際湖礁」之間，爲「憲法院」，這所謂院是一個廣大的院子，有坦道·水池·草地·花床·樹薩，歷史人像，其中華盛頓像高八十五英尺。從「憲法院」的廣塲出發，四通八達，可通至各陳列塲所。「國際湖礁」一到夜間最爲美觀，所有放烟火，五彩噴水池，電光彩虹等都在這裏，這是「世展」目迷五色的中心區。</p>
<p>陳列一瞥</p>
<p>本屆博覽會不僅是一僩萬花筒，也是世間常識的總滙，人類智愚的紀錄。所以參觀者身入其境，倒不是僅僅的嘗試新奇，觀看珍異而已，在不知不覺之中，確能增進非常豐富的知識。會塲中陳列得五花八門，包羅萬象，雖窮幾日的光陰，也不能盡量領略，這裏只不過介毌百分之一二罷了。</p>
<p>生產　這一門可說集新奇之大成，各以出品者爲單位。目下天氣酷熱，我們不妨只看調節氣候的陳列室。有一間玻璃小房子，一個人跑走去之後，就有機械把這個人身上的溫度量出來。又有一聞大廳，裏　表演空氣調節的成績，如有一千尺的高空中，八千五百尺的礦穴中，或北冰箱洋的一家工廠，及熱帶區的一家電話公司中，如何把空氣調節得適合於各個人的體溫。此外這門中陳列的有照相·電氣·鐘表·玻璃·五金·石油·電力·鋼繈等等。</p>
<p>運輸　包括汽車·橡皮胎輪·火車和飛機等陳列。裏面以克雷斯勒和通用汽車公司的兩家佈置最稱特色。通用公司所陳列的爲一九六〇年（卽廿年後）的公路交通情狀。所用小型汽車運貨車等多至一萬六千輛。鐵路廣塲所陳列的，都是「鐵馬」的歷史。佔地十方英畝，半英里的軌路，出品陳列者有二十七家主要的鐵道公司。從燒木柴的火車到現在流綫型電氣火車，無不應有盡有</p>
<p>娛樂　美國人性喜活動，愛好運動娛樂，這個「大白路」的大樂園，包括了娛樂界中的一切精華。本年的水上娛樂爲一九三九年所無。有五百個團員，包括許多美貌女子，在水上奏樂，澄波妙音，飄飄欲仙。又有一種冷熱表演，上半段是各種女人跳舞，非常熱烈，下半段爲冰上浴女，又令人不寒而慄。此外種種亦不勝縷述</p>
<p>花花絮絮</p>
<p>關於今年博覽會有趣味的片段，略述如下：</p>
<p>去年博覽會開慕之時，當局滿以爲至少可吸引六千萬遊客，可是結果，實際上買票入塲遊覽的觀衆只有二五，八一七，二六五名，還不及預算之半，乃不得不認爲失敗，故今年乃改變作風。</p>
<p>第一天開幕日，晚上九時止，參觀者人數爲十八萬八千一百人。在會塲及四週維持秩序的紐約警察與暗探，共有一千三百八十五名。</p>
<p>吃的問題，會塲中代客解決，極爲週到。會塲中共有餐館不下六十處，開幕第一天食客共約十五萬人。各式的茶餐，大小貴賤均備，而且各種口味俱有。便宜者只須化上二角或三角錢，貴的高至二元或三元。一九三九年會期中所售出的卽夾臘腸的山明治，共計一千二百萬只，眞是洋洋大觀。</p>
<p>會塲中三百所房子的造價在四千萬與五千萬美金之間。造屋的工程差不多抵上一個可住八萬居民的一個城市。建築的期間，前後不過三年而已。</p>
<p>全會塲中共有電影館六十所，每天需要開映，有聲無聲或有色的影片五百餘部。</p>
<p>會塲中所懸的旗幟至少有三千種，代表七十一國，五十四州，和無數的團體集會等。</p>
<p>會塲地下所埋的水管，煤氣管，垃圾管，電綫管等，所費共美金一千二百萬元，這是參觀者所看不到的。</p>
<p>去年爲建築房屋而用之油漆，共二百餘噸。本年春季爲飾新所用之油漆也已過一百噸了。</p>
<p>會塲大門每小時可容十六萬人入塲。</p>
<p>「生活一陳列門中的珠實鑽石部，價値數百萬元。兩大盒的鑽石，還未經修琢，價値一百五十萬美金，有特造的警戒亭，用武裝警嚴密監守。</p>
<h3>莫洛托夫與李本特洛甫（上）</h3>
<p>— 恩</p>
<p>德蘇協定成立已十個月，大家覺得這是歐戰中一個重大問題。德蘇的關係是否從此更加密切，還是急轉直下的變成決裂而交戰呢？這個答案的大部份，却要看談判這協定的當局，就是歐洲兩個最活躍的人物——莫洛托夫和李本特洛甫的動向如何而定。現在且把紐約Herald-Tribune歐洲通訊員柏遜，關於這兩位拉攏希特勒史太林的幕後人物的素描，介紹在下面。</p>
<p>敏銳的政治觀察家至今還有些恍惚，究竟是史太林做了希特勒的傀儡，還是德國的元首已成爲蘇俄神秘領袖的牽綫木人頭。</p>
<p>一九三九年八月二十三日，德蘇兩國締結離奇的婚事，當時大家覺得共產黨和國社黨兩相結合為不可信。如果把莫洛托夫和李本脫洛甫僅僅看作這個婚禮的賓相，未免看低了。任何人熟悉莫李兩人的個性，和他們事業成就的經過者，決計不能以爲這兩位具有野心的攻勢外交家，僅僅是仰承他們主子應聲蟲，却須承認，這個不可捉摸的德蘇協定實在全是他們兩人一手包辦的。</p>
<p>說起莫洛托夫的儀表，倒和美國前總統齊奧多，羅斯福相仿彿，肩膀寬廣，頭圓頸粗，看上去當有活力。隆準鼻子下面，蓄着一撮短髭，具有熱情的眼光，從夾鼻眼鏡中透射而出。他具有拳擊家和大學敎授的氣魄。每一動作，都流露着力量和自信心。他在演說時的音調，把握着頂點的時候，那高高的一聲，和齊奧多羅斯福在講台上的神情，眞有異曲同功之妙。　　　可是莫洛托夫有口吃的毛病，他的口吃，奇怪得很，與他的性情有關。有時候他接連演講數小時，一些也不打頓。有時候却吶吶的不知所云了。但是說話的工具雖不健全，而他自另有一種力量，能够吸引聽衆</p>
<p>莫洛托夫之與齊奧多羅斯福相仿的地方，不僅外表而已。他的氣質之中，與齊奧多羅斯福一樣的具有自强不息的人類活力。他一旦發動了一種工作之後，沒有反對的力量可以</p>
<p>蘇聯外長莫洛托夫阻止他。如果有人想在他計劃中的一小部份加以爭論，他不惜舌敝脣焦，鞠躬盡瘁的去謂服那個人。他用大刀闊斧去對付反對者。</p>
<p>不過俄國人缺少顯著的美國人性格。莫洛托夫沒有齊奧多羅斯福應變的機敏，也沒有他所特具的幽默工夫。這位共產黨領袖心目中祇有單純的一條路。因之思考的速率很遲緩　他的同潦都知道，莫洛托夫對於一件事所下的最後決斷是無可動搖的，因為他對於其他解解決方法，至此差不多已完全細細的研究過了。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫原名維亞乞斯拉夫斯克萊萍，是一僩小商人之子，生於五十年前。莫洛托夫！在俄文裏是「鐵鎚」的意思，乃是他在靑年時代從事下層革命工作所用的假名。世界聞名的音樂作曲定亞力山大斯克萊萍是他的叔叔，是俄國貴族份子，所以莫洛托夫的政敵常以這種親戚關係來攻擊莫氏。其實莫洛托夫除了有愛好音樂的遺傳性外，他在物質上從來沒有得到他叔叔的好處。他的父親貧窮異常，不得不榨取自己的血汗來培植兒子，獲得較高的敎育。</p>
<p>靑年的莫洛托夫爲饑寒所迫，不得不爲生活而奮鬥。他不願意享受他父親的資助。他資質極爲聰明，很可以成爲一個成功的經濟學敎授，或者，除了他口齒吃吶的毛病外，又可成爲一個律師。但是他終於參加革命工作，不顧危險置身下層，在工廠中，甚至在他讀書的愛彼德工藝學院中，組織共產黨細胞。</p>
<p>那時候莫洛托夫是一個臉色蒼白，身體瘦弱的小夥子。衣服襤褸，頭髮蓬蓬，一雙近視眼，也不戴上眼鏡。他和一班急進的靑年一般，好像命中注定，他們的一生，惟有在講台上或小飯館中，辯論馬克斯主義。</p>
<p>他曾在牢獄之中研讀了許多書籍，因爲不時被捕，大學的課程也是時斷時續的習學而秘密出版的共產黨機關報眞理報編輯，史太林是該報的總主筆。在那時期中，他與史太林已成為莫逆，所以議拔這「鐵鎚」成爲領袖的，還是那個「鋼人」呢。莫洛托夫二十六歲那年，為俄皇被逐至西比利亞，但幾個月之後，他就逃脫了。</p>
<p>次年，一九一七年，正是俄國革命的高潮時期，莫洛托夫做了共產黨最有能力的領袖。他雖遭監禁，窮困，和饑餓等磨折，心志身體，兩方面都沒有受損，說也奇怪，反而使他的身體日趨壯健。他那一種廣肩軒昂的神情，和對各種問題所具有的大無畏及實是求是的作風，使他在僚屬之中，有鶴立雞羣之姿態。莫洛托夫與托洛斯基，終覺難親易疏，有些格格不入，托洛斯基常說他是一個「沒有希望，沒有創作力」的人。</p>
<p>列寗回返俄國之後，莫洛托夫就把名義上的領袖資格讓給他。但是不到兩年，他又脫頴而出，置身機要，成為蘇俄經濟家中的驕子。</p>
<p>他曾於一九二七年，不顧一切推行集體農塲制。這一件工作在開始之時，非常艱鉅，反革合的勢力張牙舞爪而來，因之共產黨幾個領袖頗有勸請暫時放秦這個計劃之議。甚至史太林也有一時不敢下手，感覺幾百萬有力農民為保護他們土地起見，竭力反對社會主義的勢力為不可侮。莫洛托夫却放出了他「鐵鎚」的本色，向反對者猛力痛擊，結果人類歷史上最大農民革命卒吿完成。</p>
<p>當其他共產黨領袖，懾於史太林的愛惡，而變爲百事不管的時期中，莫洛托夫仍舊動作不息，對於個人榮辱毫不置意。一九三〇年當選為人民委員會主席，他並不以主席地位看作空銜，對於其他委員力加鞭策，實行首揆職責，於受賄溺職等事，尤為痛惡。他的同僚覺得他比史太林還要可怕哩</p>
<p>一九三五年，正當史太林對於听謂吒派諸人，爲了「顚覆」政府，和與德國軍事當局訂立秘密同盟約罪名，大舉淸黨時，莫洛托夫曾在蘇俄第七屆會議席上，建議與希特勒進行保障和平的談判。在他的演詞中，凡是機敏耳朵，已可聽到他已隱的將有成竹，傾向於簽訂德蘇協定了。這位人民委員會主席，要求希特勒撤鉗他「我的奮鬥」一書中對於蘇俄的一切恫嚇，因此而建築德蘇兩國間的和平大道。史太林當時雖已內定，要把黨中傾向聯德的幾個重要份子，加以肅淸，見他自己手下的大員，竟也公然提倡與德言好起來了。史太林於恭聆莫洛托夫的一番宏論之後，說也奇怪，竟照單全收了。</p>
<p>莫洛托夫走的祇有一條路，講的祇有一種話，是一個現實的思想家。李本脫洛甫風趣高雅，能操數國言語，遇事臨機應變。這兩人眞是絕對相反，這種對照竟是無處可覓。一個是拳頭大臂膊粗的外交家，一個却具手上帶着絲絨手套的作風。俄國人粗魯無文沒有機變，不兜圈子，不講社交面子。德國人常常笑容，善於奉承，有暗諷的天才，在沒有把握着重心之前，不惜迂迴曲折，多方商討。兩人的不同如此，而兩人的相同之點，也很奇怪。兩個人都跳出了向來外交家的蹊徑，對於自己的信任，非常頑固，而不易動搖。</p>

<h3>耶蘇是病人的救主</h3>
<p>疾病為人生最痛苦的事，損失之大，非言語所可形容。古來學者想種種方法以圖救治者，代不乏人，可惜他們只能治標，不能治本。耶蘇在世的時候，大眾公認祂為空前絕後的神醫，凡屬不治的絕症，雖科學昌明時代如今日者，尚未發明特效醫術能與耶蘇相比擬。當時有各色患病的人，經了耶蘇的手一摸，未有不着手成春：祂使癩瘋能潔淨，使瞎子能看見，使瘸腿能行走，又使患十二年血漏的女子能痊癒；使十八年的駝背老婦能直立，使三十八年的癱子能起來奔走，甚至於三個已經斷了氣的人一個個復活過來，事實詳載聖經，絕非捏造。在耶蘇未降生以前七百多年，有一位先知早已預言說：「祂代替我們的軟弱，擔當我們的疾病。」耶蘇因救人而來，在世上表彰了上主的大愛，以愛行醫，真是一切痛苦疾病者的救主。現在中國教會所創辦的大小醫院有二百三十餘所，每年服務病人有幾百萬名；飲水思源，耶蘇恩賜。耶蘇不獨能醫治身體上各種疾病，也能醫治心靈上的疾病；身體上的疾病本來痛苦，而心靈上的疾病比較更痛苦。心靈上的疾病究竟是什麼？就是罪惡。如聖經所說凡不義的事都是：邪惡、貪婪、惡毒、嫉妒、兇殺、爭競、詭詐、毒恨、淫亂等等罪惡，發生於內心，其害足以　賊身心，消滅志氣，剝奪人生幸福，擾亂社會安寧；耶蘇來世的目的是拯救我們，是和害人身心的惡魔格鬥。祂曾經說：「康健的人用不着醫生，有病的人方才用得着；我來本不是召義人，乃是救罪人。」世上名醫僅能治人假病，頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳，，只能治標不能治本；獨耶蘇能治身心上一切不治的絕症。朋友倘若你肯誠心相信，悔罪改過，聽　吩咐，嫉惡如仇；他一定能使你得平安，使你一切的災病得醫治；同時祂賜你有重生能力，使你心中充滿屬靈的喜樂，而得身心健康，生命更豐盛。患病同胞們快快起來！唯有耶蘇是你們的救主。</p>

<p>徵文印花</p>

<h3>蟲與彈</h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>這幾天的氣候是很炎熱，尤其在吃了午飯後的一二小時。在往日，庸兒便懶洋洋地到學校裏去上下半天的課，就是天熱到一百度，學校裏卻不得不去的。可是今天是休假日，那因熱的天氣，委實使他本有出門的意念打消得無踪跡。到得吃了午飯後，打了一時左右的午睡，便悄悄地起了身。想把假期作業幹一下，那知也打不起他的興趣，他的哥哥，恐怕也是天熱的緣故，躲在家裏。於是庸兒和宗兒搭訕着。</p>
<p>「哥哥，這幾天歐洲的戰事打得怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「你為什麼平日不時時留意呢？這種閱報的習慣確可養成的。歐洲的戰事打得如火如荼，烈　彌天，飛機，坦克車，大砲，兵艦……都充分地顯出它們的「顏色」，人民也嘗到了和我們一樣的逃難滋味。飛機的轟炸，和高射砲的射擊，在鬥法，這一幕幕戰爭的慘劇，我們也印着很深的痕跡。」他說到這裏暫時的停留了一下，便接口道：「講到高射砲和飛機，回憶到我曾看過一本書，其中的一節很有趣味，我把我所能記得的一些大概情形說給你聽，包你一定會笑（未完）」</p>
<h3>暑假裏怎麼樣練習寫字（下）</h3>
<p>— 沈百英</p>
<p>（一）練習小字，可以抄寫國語書中的雜詞難句，或者抄寫報章雜誌上的故事。一種練習，有兩種收穫，一舉兩得，再好沒有。</p>
<p>（二）練習中字或大字，可以向學校裏分借幾本字貼，各人輪流使用。</p>
<p>（三）其他關於應用方面的材料，也可以利用暑假期間，多多收集。將來一定有許多用處。例如一張衛生佈告：「蒼蠅為害，大家知道。現當夏令，飛出不少。四處產卵，產額不少，傳染霍亂，兇如虎豹。上吐下瀉，性命難保。告我市民，大家分曉；垃圾箱蓋，留心關好；魚腥肉類，少吃為妙；一切污物，趕快棄掉。切記切記！除害趁早！」又如一張商店傳單：「貨物高低不一，貨身最宜研究，本店精選各貨，敢說無出其右。家庭日常用品，花色應有盡有。品質與眾不同，定價與眾不侔，絕不以偽亂真，絕不虛浮折扣。現正廉價時期，實行削碼賤售。新貨堆積如山，大可自由選購。各界請來參觀，才知我話不謬。」</p>
<p>諸位或者更要問：「現在紙張昂貴，有什麼價廉的東西可用呢？」據我想到的辦法有兩種：一種是用舊報紙或破書寫；一種是用一塊大方磚醮着水寫。此外或有更好的方法，請諸位告訴我罷，我卻說不出了。</p>
<p>最後，諸位還要附帶問我：「在學校裏寫好了字，可請先生批評。那些字寫得好，那些字寫得不好。寫得不好的，錯在那裏，下次應該怎麼樣改正。每批評一次，就有一次的進步。如今放了暑假，在家裏自修，有誰來批評呢？」我想，只要天天用心練習，批評總是小事。辦法有幾條，可給你們作參考：</p>
<p>第一個辦法，請父母伯叔兄弟等批評。</p>
<p>第二個辦法，約集幾個同學，相互批評。</p>
<p>第三個辦法，自己批評。每次練習完畢，將成績釘在墻上，退後幾步，遠遠地看去。如果小字能夠寫得字匀行直，就是好的成績，大字能夠寫得個個平穩，不像跌倒的樣子，也就是好的成績。還可以把前次的成績，並列放在一起，究竟有沒有進步，一比自會分曉。</p>
<p>話不多說，你們要問暑假裏怎麼樣練習寫字才容易進步？我的回答是：一切在於諸位自己。誰肯努力用功，將來必有好的收穫。」光陰過得很快，月餘暑假，一眨眼就會過去。諸位小朋友努力用功吧！再會！再會！</p>

<h3>世界唯一馬戲學校雜寫</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>專門訓練馬戲人材的職業學校，全世界僅有一所在美國威斯康新州馬尼他華克地方，這裏，把那馬戲學校的情况的略的寫一些在下面：</p>
<p>創辦經過　此馬戲學校，成立於一九二七年，創辦人斯却爾滋（William　Schultz）爲研究馬戲藝術的專家，精於武術，十多年來他對於這馬戲學校的經營，曾煞費苦心，才有今日的成績。除了他以外，其他擔任各種課程的敎師，也十九是馬戲專家，過往曾在馬戲班裏表演而出過風頭的。</p>
<p>功課繁多　馬戲學校中所授的功課，門類也很多，關於馬戲部門，有武術，走繩，倒走等，其他普通課方面，如讀本，寫作，算術等，也相當重視，編制方面，完全照普通的職業學校，所以像打字，家事科學，和機械學等課目也同時敎授。</p>
<p>訓練期間　進馬戲學校的學生，大半爲年輕的兒童，經過五年的嚴密訓練，才能成一個業餘的馬戲演員，再經過兩年的高級訓練，就能成爲一個職業的馬戲家，而得能加入馬戲班表演。但歷年以來，能够修畢高級課程的人不多，大半中途輟學。</p>
<p>公開表演　學校言面每隔兩年舉行一次馬戲表演，定期六天，目的是在宣傳而促外界對這馬戲學校的注意，在表演時節，各地的人，都會老遠趕來，盛况空前，爲的一般人對於馬戲學校學生的演技，早已相當欽佩，所以聽說有公開表演，十九以先覩爲快的。</p>
<p>出路容易　該校歷屆畢業生，受馬戲班之聘而在各地表演者，足跡已遍及全世界，各國馬戲班的演員，時常有人寫信到馬戲學校去，要求入校深造，但在馬戲學校方面，因格於習俗，一概拒絕，爲的該校所有學生，僅以馬尼他華克的兒童爲限，客地的學生向來不收的，祇是使有志者望門興歎而已。</p>
<h3>歌塲窘態</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>憶票友某君，飾凈角，與一陸某飾鬚生者唱瓊林宴，是日劇列壓軸，朋輩捧塲甚烈，演至鬧府時，某君飾葛登雲出塲，與范仲禹坐定之後，例應由葛登雲先唱「太師府」原板一段，胡琴過門方竣，葛登雲之唱詞，竟以忘却，無法唱出，琴師於此，遂祗得再拉過　以爲補救，詎此時范仲禹見葛登雲忘詞，爲敷衍塲面計，除道白「太師爺」一句外，卽爲之逕自接唱「我本是」，此際葛登雲已因道曰「太師爺」句提醒，竟亦同時唱出「太師府」，於是一生一凈，同時開口，台下遂鬨然。旣而范仲禹以葛登雲既已唱出，遂不再接「一窮儒」句，孰知葛登雲亦以此意不再接唱「擺酒宴」，又同時不作一聲，合座更騷然。之二君者，當此窘境，竟撩袍遁入戲房，幸班底機警，亟另以伶人登塲始息，劇塲此種情形，雖不多見，顧同時張口，同時停唱，細思當時滑稽狀態，恐未有不啞然失笑者矣。</p>
<h3>趙景深　杜子美　合編「女性之光」</h3>
<p>— 彭華</p>
<p>「女性之光」是巴金的三部曲「家」「春」「秋」的改編的電影劇本，這是中國文壇上的一部巨著。</p>
<p>大中學生，幾乎都看過這部小說，足見這三部小說，已經　讀者看得人迷了；同時可以知道讀者們怎樣地愛護着這三部小說。</p>
<p>戰前，文學家趙景深先生，早想把牠編成電影劇本，擬交聯華影片公司，陳燕燕女士主演之。並且已得作者巴金允許，後來因爲他們人事繁，所以遲遲沒有動手編寫。</p>
<p>現在，他利用暑假期間，業已和杜子美君在開始編寫中（按杜君是他硏究文學的學生）</p>
<p>不過，「家」「春」「秋」，情節非常複雜，假如三部要合併一部改作，不會嫌太長麼？這倒是一個値得拿來考慮的問題</p>
<p>這次「家」「春」一秋」改編劇本，無疑是給現在的古裝片「民間故事」一個打擊！牠可以不客氣地對他們說：「你該退位啦」！</p>
<h3>中友劇團公演</h3>
<p>石華父之「職業婦女」叫幕劇，自經上海劇藝社上演後，深得各界好評，現此劇將於今日上午九時半及下午三時，再度在辣斐劇塲公演，演出者為「中友劇團」，係上海中法校友會戲劇組主辦，去歲成立，今屆週歲之期，特舉行實騐公演以資紀念，導演聞爲賈濟川云</p>
<h3>勞萊哈台永遠合作　已訂立諒解的契約</h3>
<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>勞萊與哈台，這一對銀幕上天字第一號的滑稽明星；自從合作演出以來，確曾受到全球人士極力的讚譽。可是，二人常常在鬧拆離的消息，這一點是爲素來愛護他們的觀衆們所不安的。據倫敦方面的消息，此項事情的發生，大半的緣故係由於劇本上的編制不均，往往在他們的片中，勞萊較哈台所佔的地位爲着重。</p>
<p>迄至最近，二人是重復合作了；並且是有着永不再拆離的趨勢。原來二人問已成立了一種諒解，並且還訂了一張法律式的契的，的內雖沒有規定担保日後他們的片中再不會發生以前同樣的缺點；但劉於合作一點，却是已立下了鞏固的基礎；凡二人中任何一人不願合作，就須處以大量的罰金。</p>
<p>跟着時代的變遷，當今好萊塢銀壇上的一批批燦爛光芒的紅星，亦終有一天會變得沉寂無聲。卽以這一對滑稽明星而言，慢慢的他們的演技會在觀衆們的目光中减少了興趣。所以，他們要保持日後的聲譽，除了二人應該永久合作外，在演技上亦急需要有一種改善，各界的意見是希望他們以後所演的片中，能够有多量自創的幽默說白。</p>

<p>第三章　對立的情報</p>
<p>霍桑增加了注意的神色，又道：「吵起來？你可曾聽得什麼？」</p>
<p>老毛道：「那姓余的話，我當然聽不見，但王小姐說的，我却聽得幾句。」「伊說些什麽？」「伊說『是的，有這事。』……『你配管我？』……『你有這個膽！』……『放屁！……』那時姑老爺恰巧從外面回進來，便勸王小姐不要發火，王小姐才把聽筒用力一擱，怒氣匆匆地上樓去。」</p>
<p>霍桑的限光越顯得莊肅了，自言自語地說：「道個人的確不能輕視。……金壽兄，我們有找他來談一談的必要。」</p>
<p>老毛不等倪金壽發表意見，又搶着說：「還有呢。就是那天他跟王小姐在這客室裏鬧的時候，有幾句話聽了也很可怕。」</p>
<p>霍桑道：「什麽話？」老毛道：「他在這裏跟王小姐和姓趙的吵，我雖然沒有完全聽得，但他們的聲音很響，形勢很可怕。後來姑老爺勸着姓余的出去，他一路走，一路嘴裏還在駡人：『無情無義的東西！……好，我敎你便宜！』先生，你想想看，他明明跟王小姐過不去。現在王小姐這樣被人打死，不是他打的是誰？」</p>
<p>霍桑又低垂了頭，好像在估量老毛的見解有沒有成立的可能。倪金壽又接替着問。</p>
<p>「你的話都是眞實的嗎？」</p>
<p>老毛堅決地說：「沒有半句假。」</p>

<h3>Germany's Plan to Invade England Inevitably Doomed to Fail: Observations by American Figures</h3>
<p>Washington – Chairman Bloom of the House Foreign Affairs Committee told the press today that Germany's plan to invade England is bound to fail. He stated that there is no doubt that Britain will be able to resist Germany's blitzkrieg strategy. Mr. Bloom predicted that Britain will be able to resist Germany until victory is achieved. He said that the conquest of Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France was not due to Germany's military strength, but rather to the result of the "Fifth Column's cunning schemes." Britain has already recognized this danger and has taken all possible steps to destroy the activities of the Fifth Column. Britain is now united and prepared for war with Germany. Bloom further pointed out that as long as the British Navy possesses naval supremacy, Germany's plan to invade England will become even more difficult. (United Press Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Axis Powers Arrange a New Formation: Large-Scale Attack on England Not Far Off; Situation in the Balkans Fully Clarified; Italian Newspaper Claims British Mediterranean Traffic Cut Off</h3>
<p>Zurich – According to a telegram from a correspondent in Rome for a certain newspaper here, the Axis powers' attack on Britain and the British Empire will likely begin within four or five days, as the recent Munich Conference has fully clarified the situation in Southeastern Europe, deeming it no longer necessary to delay. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome – The official "International Relations Report" published a lengthy article stating that Britain's day of reckoning will occur within weeks. Countries are now exhibiting a tendency toward a new front, which should be carefully studied, as a simple diplomatic strategy can attempt to evade the responsibilities that will inevitably be placed upon those countries at the time of negotiation. Whether France adopts a Fascist system or a non-Fascist system, its serious responsibility for provoking war by attacking the Axis powers cannot be relieved. The reality of the European situation is now controlled by the aspirations of the Italians and Germans, and guided by one idea: the bloc of Fascism and National Socialism. Spain occupies a position in this bloc, and Hungary is a loyal friend of the Axis powers, and it is not its fault that its legitimate demands have not been resolved in a spirit of goodwill. What can now be determined is that a genuine new balance of power must be established in the Balkans. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome – Renowned Italian journalist Gayda wrote in yesterday's "Italian Daily" that even if Britain dispatches over a hundred warships to the Mediterranean, the Italian Navy has already cut off communication between Britain and its colonies and has threatened British traffic in the eastern and western Mediterranean. Britain can no longer obtain supplies from the Balkans or the Near East. (United Press Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>German Aircraft Air Raids Expand Scope Over England Compared to Before</p>
<p>London – German aircraft that have been intensely bombing England for days have today expanded their bombing range to Scotland and Wales. This action appears to be in preparation for implementing their blitzkrieg tactics against England, and some people predict that Germany's attack on England may erupt next week. At dawn this morning, a German aircraft bomb fell on a certain village in Wales, but there were no casualties. Searchlights shone upon the arrival of these iron crows, and one German aircraft quickly dropped seven bombs. This was evidently a hasty release due to British fighter planes taking to the air to pursue the enemy. Yesterday, German aircraft intensely bombed the entire territory of England, and continued their work last night and this morning. The southeast, southwest, and northeast parts of Scotland were separately bombed with bombs and incendiary bombs. The number of casualties and the extent of damage are not yet known. This morning, German aircraft dropped 24 fierce bombs and 100 incendiary bombs on a certain village in the northeast, but no casualties have been reported. At the same time, the bombing of a certain town in Wales at dawn today resulted in one death and two injuries. Another town was hit by two bombs, with no casualties. Furthermore, hundreds of firefighters are currently engaged in extinguishing a major fire caused by an air raid in southeastern London. (United Press Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>London – The Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Home Security issued a communiqué this morning stating that last night, enemy aircraft dropped bombs in England, Scotland, and a small area in the northeast of Wales, destroying some houses. Although several people died, the casualties were not many. Also, one enemy aircraft flew over a certain area in southwestern Scotland, and three bombs fell on residential areas, injuring several people. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin – A communiqué from the German High Command stated that German bombers attacked ships off the coast of England and in the Channel, and also bombed airfields, ports, and arsenals in England and Scotland, sinking one patrol boat and one merchant ship, and heavily damaging five merchant ships. Yesterday, the enemy lost thirteen aircraft, and five German aircraft went missing. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Italian Air Force Takes Offensive Against British Ships in the Mediterranean</p>
<p>Rome – According to a war report from the Italian Military Headquarters, after enemy ships were bombed on the 11th, they sailed eastward in five groups. The Italian Air Force departed from various bases to pursue and attack them, and has hit at least two cruisers and one battleship. When Italian reconnaissance planes patrolled Malta, they engaged in fierce combat with four enemy destroyers, shooting down two enemy aircraft. All Italian aircraft flew back to their bases. An Italian torpedo boat was sunk by enemy bombing, but all sailors were rescued. In East Africa, Italian forces occupied a British village near Moyale. Italian aircraft shot down four enemy aircraft. Enemy aircraft attacked Kisimayo, Jijiga, and Massawa, but were shot down by an Italian destroyer and an anti-aircraft battery. All Italian aircraft flew back, and one Italian aircraft, which was reported missing yesterday, has also returned. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome – Yesterday, the Italian Air Force launched a large-scale offensive, intending to eliminate the British fleet in the Mediterranean and destroy British bases along the Mediterranean. Semi-official sources said that the British Navy suffered heavy losses from Italian bombing, and several battleships are retreating toward Alexandria. Since the major battle between the British and Italian navies in the Ionian Sea in southeastern Italy, starting on Sunday, Italian aircraft, departing from numerous bases on Wednesday alone, burned one British aircraft carrier, destroyed two British destroyers, and sank one British merchant ship. Furthermore, according to a communiqué here, the Italian Air Force's recent attack was concentrated on one British destroyer, which was escorting the remaining four merchant ships that had departed from Malta. However, shortly thereafter, the British Admiralty completely denied all the aforementioned claims by Italy. (International Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome – According to the "Italian News," the British naval strength in the Mediterranean is as follows: seven heavy battleships, two aircraft carriers, ten cruisers, a total of seventy torpedo boats and destroyers, fifteen submarines, and many small boats. The newspaper stated that the British fleet in the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea consists of seven light cruisers and twenty torpedo boats and destroyers. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Rome – The Italian Air Force continued to bomb the British naval base of Malta yesterday afternoon, dropping many bombs and incendiary bombs on the airfield. At that time, British destroyers took to the air to engage in battle, resulting in two being shot down by Italian aircraft. All Italian Air Force planes returned safely. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>France Changes its Political System</h3>
<p>Every year on this day, French citizens and friends of France are always excited and jubilant, celebrating the revolutionary anniversary of the French Republic, the National Day of founding the country.</p>
<p>This year on this day, France has only just begun to implement a dictatorial political system. The President of the Republic, Mr. Lebrun, has been removed from office, and the two houses of parliament have also been destined for the end of being dissolved and eliminated soon. General Pétain has been promoted from Prime Minister to Head of State, and assumes supreme power.</p>
<p>This is not only a change that is deeply regrettable, but what is somewhat comforting is that, although the French Revolution at that time did make great contributions to human civilization for a century and a half thereafter, drawing a new era in human history and becoming an extremely important and glorious page, and therefore becoming a world-historical achievement that transcends national borders, in short, its influence on future generations is particularly profound and far-reaching; however, this change in France is a passive following, an expedient response, and its impact on the future of France itself remains a question, and is not enough to affect any other country.</p>
<p>At the end of the 18th century, on July 14, 1789, the citizens of Paris angrily stormed and destroyed the Bastille prison, and since then the flames of revolution have risen high, overthrowing the Bourbon dynasty and adopting a republican system. This date is exactly one hundred and fifty-one years from this year. Historians argue that the significance of the French Revolution is not only the change in the national system of one country, but also (1) establishing a model of democratic politics, establishing the principle of popular sovereignty by universally granting suffrage to adult males. (2) Replacing the concept of a national organization of monarchical subjects with the expansion of civil rights, making national consciousness universally advanced. (3) Abolishing censorship of people's thoughts, getting rid of fetters, and making freedom of thought one of the basic human rights. (4) Stipulating in law the equality of believers of various religions, that is, guaranteeing freedom of belief by law. (5) Destroying the economic and commercial feudal system, allowing anyone the freedom and equality to choose a profession. What the French Revolution created and proclaimed is certainly not just these five bases; and for these five items, which are regarded as a matter of course by modern people; drinking water and thinking about the source, one cannot but attribute it to the achievements of the French Revolution, which is the beginning of modern civilized countries. For this reason, we cannot help but deeply yearn for the French Revolution of that year, and cannot help but deeply regret the political changes in France today.</p>
<p>After 1789, the French republican system was interrupted again and again; Napoleon conquered the east and west, made military achievements and reduced foreign enemies, and then claimed himself emperor; Louis XVIII restored the Bourbon dynasty with the strength of the international anti-French alliance; after that, there was Charles X, there was Louis Philippe; there was Napoleon III; all of them had fame and color, did things and accomplished things; in short, until 1870, the national system was repeatedly reversed. After stabilizing for seventy years, now that the war against Germany has failed, the situation is precarious, and General Pétain has resolutely adopted a dictatorship; although looking back on the events of seventy years ago, changing the system is not an exception, and the dictator head of state is of course different from the self-proclaimed imperial system, but the so-called democracy and the so-called freedom are almost impossible to see again.</p>
<p>According to what Head of State Pétain announced to the French people the night before last, he said that the government has huge tasks to be dealt with urgently; he also said that in the dark period when France was forced to submit to Germany, France's suffering was still continuing; he also said that this war has declared the collapse of international capitalism and international socialism, and France has now broken away from various dark treaties and alliances; but France will transform the French nation and the life of France alone with a brave and persevering spirit. All of these announcements are quite thought-provoking; moreover, recalling the recent telegrams, since Pétain and his ministers, during their leisure walks, often have wet tears and faces full of sorrow, such a situation is particularly sympathetic, but it is not enough to explain the necessary reason why France must change to a dictatorial system, nor is it enough to guarantee that the dictatorial system will be able to overcome the difficulties safely.</p>
<p>Former French Prime Minister Daladier was in power for many years, based on the majority party and expanding his power. When the situation on the Western Front became tense, he asked the parliament for greater power but could not get it, so he announced his resignation; we then questioned whether French people had not deeply believed in the dictatorial system. When Pétain came to power when the parliament was still there, with parliamentary power in hand, since the initial procedure for emerging and retiring had reached the usual practice, and using the Prime Minister to abolish the President, calling himself the Head of State, changing the political system, and creating a new constitution, the wind passed and the grass bent, and it seemed light to lift a heavy weight; we then questioned whether the essence of French democracy had long disappeared. For this reason, all those who care about France both hope that France will struggle hard and eventually achieve success, but also worry about the future disturbances caused by the further changes in the political system. It is difficult to predict the gains and losses, successes and failures of the future of the regime change, but judging from the fact that the democratic spirit of that country has long disappeared, I secretly believe that the successes and failures, gains and losses are not related to the political system; in other words, France's encounter with danger cannot be attributed to democratic politics. The world situation has changed dramatically, and people are frightened by the phenomena, mistakenly believing that the political system is short or long, and always want to imitate it. How is this different from tapping the pan and groping for the candle?</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Attack British Convoy in the English Channel: At Least Eleven Shot Down; British Aircraft Bomb Deep into German Territory</h3>
<p>London – The Air Ministry Information Office announced that the British Air Force shot down eleven German bombers yesterday, nine of which were shot down by Spitfire and Hurricane British aircraft. One was shot down each by British coastal aircraft and anti-aircraft guns. The planes were attached to land and sea areas from Abingdon to Hampshire. The first victory yesterday was achieved by six Hurricane British aircraft patrolling outside the coast of East Anglia in the early morning to protect merchant ships. Ten Henkel German aircraft came to attack merchant ships, and four of them were shot down by British aircraft. The remaining six failed to damage the ships and were driven away. After a while, two Dornier German aircraft attempted to attack the convoy, one of which was shot down by a British aircraft, and the other was also damaged. Yesterday, British aircraft lost two planes. It is now confirmed that in the aerial battle around the British coast on the 11th, a total of twenty-three enemy aircraft were destroyed. (Reuters Dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>London – British aircraft also attacked the German Walhafen, Schipol, Dechsel, and Hamstedt (on the island of Shuwen) airfields one after another yesterday afternoon. These are all bases from which enemy aircraft attack England.

<h3>Japanese Volcano Erupts Again After Seventeen Years of Inactivity: 500 Hectares of Pasture Land at the Foot of Mount Osawa Covered with Lava</h3>
<p>Tokyo – A dormant volcano on Miyake Island, 175 kilometers south of Tokyo, suddenly erupted last night. The Yokosuka Naval Station dispatched a seaplane to inspect the island's airspace at 5:00 AM this morning, arriving around 6:00 AM. According to the pilot's report, there was heavy rain, coupled with a strong wind with a speed of 20 meters per second, and dark clouds hung low. Hazy smoke emerged from the island, and lava flowed into the sea. He was unable to fly close to Mount Osawa, where the eruption occurred, but other parts of the island seemed normal.

<h3>Closing Remarks of the Seventh Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Chongqing (Continued from yesterday) Japan deeply understands this point and is apprehensive. What I mentioned above is merely a striking recent international example to illustrate the repercussions of Japan's actions. However, it is different for us in China. Because the China problem is the Asia problem, it is also a matter related to the safety of the entire world. It can be said that every country in the world hopes we can achieve victory. Everyone can see the newspapers of the Soviet Union and other friendly nations, which all published special articles on our "July 7th" anniversary of the War of Resistance, praising the great contribution of our country's three years of resistance and the significant relationship with friendly nations around the world. However, comrades, you must understand that the most important issue in increasing global sympathy lies entirely with ourselves. Only when we are self-reliant and strong can we be valued by friendly nations, and that is also our greatest guarantee of victory. Moreover, if we can truly be self-reliant, self-sufficient, then there will be no question about the victory of the War of Resistance. Everyone, consider how the emerging nations in the past decade or so have diligently governed and strived for self-improvement. It is evident that any nation, as long as it can be self-reliant and strong, can transform weakness into strength and danger into safety, no matter how adverse the environment. Otherwise, even with good conditions and advantages, it will inevitably fail to live up to its excellent innate qualities and ultimately perish. Absolutely no country in the world can exist by relying on external forces without being self-reliant, and no nation can survive by relying on external forces without being self-strengthening. We should focus on such aspects when observing the world situation and should also learn from the experiences of others and make extraordinary efforts. Regarding the diplomatic, military, political, and economic situations of the Japanese, I have already provided detailed explanations in the document I released on the anniversary of the July 7th War of Resistance. The Japanese are now not only completely trapped in a diplomatic dead end with no way out, but no one wants to ally with them, and no one will be intimidated by them. They are truly facing numerous difficulties, and the biggest problem is the issue of manpower. Japan's population is only one-sixth of ours. After the consumption of our three years of resistance, they have long felt extremely exhausted. Coupled with frequent domestic natural and man-made disasters, the Japanese have now truly reached a stage of exhaustion and are on the verge of final collapse. They still covet Annam and the South Seas, which is truly overestimating themselves. We can say that even if they occupy Annam and the South Seas, the result will only be to increase their troubles and accelerate their demise. What I find most comforting this time is that despite the scorching heat and the continuous bombings, the comrades attending the meeting have been so spirited and worked so hard, for eight days, from beginning to end, without any slackening. This is truly a sign that the final victory of our War of Resistance is inevitable. We revolutionaries should have this kind of spirit. Despite the continuous indiscriminate bombings by Japanese planes, even after they dropped such a large 1,000-pound bomb around this place at three o'clock today, we still held our meeting as usual at the bombing site at four o'clock, and no one was absent. This shows that our revolutionary spirit is indeed becoming stronger through adversity and more invigorated through hardship. In particular, the Japanese have launched indiscriminate bombings for more than two months now. Our people have suffered such cruel threats, but they are not afraid at all. They are only more calm and courageous, and everything is business as usual, burying themselves in work. It is truly as if nothing has happened. We also see the situation of children and young people singing and serving in air raid shelters, taking care of their parents and elders, which is even more endearing. Our compatriots are able to be so brave, calm, enduring, and resilient, which truly inspires and motivates us. After three years of such significant sacrifices by the military and civilians of the entire country, the social morale is becoming more and more courageous and resilient, which has become more firm over time. This effect can be said to be entirely due to the inspiration of our Premier's ideology, which also proves that our Three Principles of the People have deeply penetrated the hearts of the people of the entire country, so that compatriots across the country, regardless of men, women, old, or young, are becoming more and more enthusiastic every day, and the unity between the government and the people is becoming closer every day. With such a great revolutionary ideology and such an excellent national spirit, how should we, the central comrades who bear the responsibility of leadership, work together to live up to our Premier and be worthy of our compatriots across the country? Everyone must understand that after three years of bloody battles, we have truly gained unlimited confidence. If our nation, which is so tenacious and hardworking, cannot independently survive in the world, then which nation in the world can be independent and survive? Understanding the situation of the Japanese even more can allow us to realize that we are becoming stronger through fighting. The final victory of the War of Resistance will definitely be in our hands, comrades.</p>
<p>It must be noted that while the current situation is indeed beneficial to our War of Resistance, we should always prepare for the arrival of the most serious and difficult period. Because any career, especially the cause of revolutionary nation-building, will inevitably encounter the most difficult and arduous step as it approaches the final stage of success. This is a certain principle. For example, when we refine metal into pure steel, genuine steel cannot be refined unless the heat reaches the most intense and highest point. Therefore, if we want to win the War of Resistance and revive the nation, we must also go through this highest degree of difficulty before we can succeed. Just as before the sky dawns and day breaks, there must be a time of extreme darkness, and then infinite light will emerge from it. We must never say that because we have not encountered much difficulty in the three years of the War of Resistance, there will be no difficulties in the future. We should be sharpening our swords in time, preparing with the most perseverance and strength to overcome the extremely difficult period that is bound to come, overcome any obstacles, and break through any dangers, so that we can obtain the final victorious path to light. Our comrades must also know that our War of Resistance is entirely the strength of the Three Principles of the People, and our Party should take the initiative as a pioneer in taking risks and overcoming difficulties. From now on, the success or failure of the War of Resistance and the survival or demise of the nation are entirely the responsibility of our Party. Comrades, everyone should regard the life of the Party as their own life, and be determined to perish with the Party when it perishes, and survive with the Party when it survives. Entrust all personal safety, life, death, honor, disgrace, fortune, and misfortune to the Party, obey the Party's orders, and abide by the Party's discipline. As long as everyone can promote Party ethics, execute Party orders, and implement Party resolutions, then our country and nation will definitely be able to independently survive, and the War of Resistance and nation-building will definitely achieve final success. Especially the comrades who have come from afar this time, those who are responsible in various Party, government, and military aspects, should adhere to this spirit, work diligently and earnestly, and widely publicize the spirit and important resolutions of this meeting in the front and rear provinces and regions, inspire Party members, supervise subordinates, and mobilize compatriots to be of one heart and one mind, each performing their duties, and complete our War of Resistance and revolutionary work. Our three years of bloody battles in the past, with the sacrifice of countless comrades and compatriots, have laid this foundation for inevitable victory. We must remember the loyalty and bravery of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country, examine the great responsibility of those who survived, and intensify our efforts in the face of the current environment. Then our light and victory are at hand. We deeply hope that all Party comrades and compatriots across the country will work together and not hesitate to make sacrifices to complete the mission of revolutionary nation-building and achieve our goal of realizing the Three Principles of the People.

<h3>Blockade of the Yunnan-Burma Road Cargo Transport Rumor of British Acceptance of Japanese Demands Craigie and Arita Allegedly Signed Agreement Prohibition of Military Equipment, Automobiles, etc. from Being Transported to China via Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo According to Asahi Shimbun, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador to Japan Craigie allegedly concluded an agreement on Friday regarding Britain's prohibition of military equipment and automobiles. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced yesterday that the negotiations between Foreign Minister Arita and the British Ambassador yesterday had made satisfactory progress. A detailed announcement regarding this matter is expected to be made public on Monday. Sources with inside information said that this agreement still needs the approval of the British government, but considering the instructions received from London by Craigie before his meeting with Arita on Friday, it is believed here that the agreement can be approved soon. Asahi Shimbun also stated that the Japanese government now intends to increase the personnel of the Japanese Consulate in Rangoon in order to closely inspect the nature and quantity of transportation on the Burma Road. The newspaper also stated that the Japanese government is very satisfied with the British government's previous reply regarding the transportation of goods to Hong Kong, as the British authorities stated that they would take measures to prohibit the transportation of munitions entering Chongqing via Hong Kong. (13th United Press report)</p>
<p>Tokyo It is heard that the British have now agreed to the Japanese demands regarding the Yunnan-Burma Road, but the details have not yet been resolved. Asahi Shimbun reported that British Ambassador Craigie notified Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday afternoon that the British government had decided "basically and substantially" to accept the Japanese demand to stop the transportation of supplies and economic goods on the Burma Road to Chongqing. Arita then discussed with Craigie the types of goods to be stopped and the specific measures to be taken for two hours. As a result, the two sides reached a general agreement. After the talks, the British Ambassador telegraphed his government for instructions in order to obtain a formal understanding as soon as possible. Asahi Shimbun also stated that the materials to be prohibited will include weapons, ammunition, motor trucks, and gasoline. When necessary, officials from the Japanese Consulate in Rangoon will serve as inspectors. Therefore, the personnel of the Rangoon Consulate will be increased. The newspaper continued to say that the point about inspectors will not be included in the formal British-Japanese understanding. As for the Hong Kong route, it is heard that the Japanese government is satisfied with the British reply of July 8, which stated that the Hong Kong government authorities had taken measures to prohibit the transportation of military supplies to China to aid the Chongqing government. (13th Reuters report)</p>
<p>London It has recently been confirmed by reliable sources that regarding the British-Japanese agreement established by Britain in response to Japan's request to block the Yunnan-Burma Road, Britain has argued that this blockade should be limited to three months. (13th United Press report)</p>
<p>Tokyo The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman declared yesterday that Japan hopes that Britain can provide a satisfactory reply regarding the request to block traffic on the Yunnan-Burma Road. It is said that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie, when visiting the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, indicated that the British reply would be of this nature. (13th Haito News Agency report)</p>
<p>Chongqing According to reliable sources, the Chinese government has repeatedly notified the British government of its deep concern regarding the negotiations between Britain and Japan regarding the issue of transportation through Burma. Chinese officials attach importance to the fact that China has the right to demand that the Burmese roads should continue to be open for international transportation. From the perspective of the Chinese people, the Burmese roads were once one of the few international routes available to China, so the maintenance of this route is extremely important for the continuation of friendly relations between China and Britain. (13th report)</p>
<p>Chongqing According to a senior official of the National Government, the negotiations in Tokyo regarding transportation between Britain, Hong Kong, Burma, and China seem to have the appearance of a compromise with Japan. All sectors of the Chinese community are very surprised to hear this. Japan has no right to interfere in this. Britain, with regard to international public law, League of Nations resolutions, and the honor that great powers should enjoy, should refuse the demands made by Japan to close the routes. Britain has repeatedly stated that its foreign policy towards the Far East has not changed and that it will not take any action that would harm China. They believe that today's British cabinet will not repeat the great mistake made during the September 18 Incident. According to reliable sources, Japan, compelled by economic and other difficulties, has decided not to start conflicts with other countries. It is now only trying to show strength diplomatically in order to achieve its goals safely without encountering armed resistance. Chinese political circles hope to obtain reassuring news from the British side to clarify the situation and correct the mistaken impressions caused by the news from Tokyo. (13th Reuters report)</p>
<p>Hong Kong The British government has again instructed its ambassador to Japan, Craigie, to negotiate with Arita on the issue of prohibiting the transportation of goods to China via Hong Kong and Burma. The reasons held by Britain are: (1) The British government cannot prohibit legal trade between Burma, India, and China, and Japan has no right to demand a ban. (2) The British government has an obligation to abide by the resolutions passed by the League of Nations that member states should provide assistance to China separately. Therefore, it is difficult for Britain to comply with such a ban. However, the Japanese side is still dissatisfied and will threaten to intensify the blockade of Hong Kong. This was originally a step planned by the foreign ministry and the military department of the Japanese government to use both soft and hard tactics in an attempt to get Britain to comply with its demands. It is heard that the British government's attitude has recently been firm, and it is unwilling to destroy its position on its Far Eastern policy. (12th report)</p>

<h3>US Explains Monroe Doctrine Chongqing Newspaper Criticizes Claims It's a Sign of Weakening Far East Policy</h3>
<p>Chongqing Newspapers here have recently criticized US President Roosevelt's article "Asia for Asians," published by his secretary O'Leary, claiming that President Roosevelt's statement is a sign of the United States weakening its Far East policy.</p>
<p>Xinhua Daily</p>
<p>The Communist Party organ newspaper Xinhua Daily even claimed that the United States has abandoned its position of leadership in the world. The newspaper said that the collapse of France in Europe has given Japan a good opportunity and made it impossible for the United States to resolve the Sino-Japanese war through the Nine-Power Treaty. The newspaper also said that the US Navy is not stronger than the British, and the US Air Force is even weaker. Even after mobilization, the number of people recruited by the US Army in a month is only one-tenth of the German army. Even by July 1, 1941, the total number of US Army, Navy, and aircraft will be at most 6,000. The newspaper also made a harsh criticism, saying that even if the entire American people wholeheartedly expressed their opposition to the blockade of Japan, US scrap iron and gasoline are still being supplied to Japan in a continuous stream.</p>
<p>Shishi Xinbao</p>
<p>Shishi Xinbao stated that the Secretary of State is preparing to give a new interpretation of President Roosevelt's statement, which is indeed worthy of our attention. However, the remarks in the original statement involving Vietnam have already been undeniably made. In reality, the United States can no longer maintain the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty. It must be understood that the world is a whole group, and Asia is a part of the group. If the Asia problem cannot be resolved satisfactorily, then the whole world, including the Americas, cannot hope for safety. What is even more ridiculous is that Hull actually said that the United States has no intention of interfering in any Asian issues except for the Dutch East Indies, because the Dutch East Indies are the source of tin and rubber needed by the United States. May I ask, is the relationship between the United States and Japan only about tin and rubber? The United States' inability to tolerate Japan's acquisition of the Dutch East Indies is aimed at tin and rubber. Now the relationship between the United States and China is far greater than the mere tin and rubber. Can the United States tolerate Japan conquering China? If Japan conquers all of Asia, its threat to the United States will be greater than Germany conquering all of Europe. It must be understood that the Soviet Union's competition is not only to protect its own territory, but also to protect small and weak countries. Only with this kind of method can aggression be stopped. Therefore, the United States should also adopt the same attitude as the Soviet Union. British Prime Minister Chamberlain and former French Prime Minister Daladier have rashly sacrificed many small and weak countries and brought disaster to their own countries. The lessons of the past are a warning. I hope that the intelligent Americans will not repeat the mistakes. (13th United Press report)</p>

<p>All measures we are currently taking to ensure national security and the welfare of the people are progressing without difficulty. The people of Turkey are also fulfilling their duties with a joyful trust and generous spirit. Those who wish to influence Turkey must first know that Turkey is no longer the dead Ottoman Empire of the past. The advancement or retreat of Turkish politicians can only be determined and agreed upon by the Turkish Parliament. Those who are currently in charge of Turkish affairs have only one aim, which is the safety of the Turkish Republic. At the same time, we also encourage friendships that are suitable for Turkey's interests and security. Turkey does not betray its friendships, nor does it neglect its independence and freedom. We are now united, calmly awaiting developments. We do not want to provoke or attack neighboring countries, and we are deeply gratified to see that neighboring countries share the same sentiment. If there is any action that endangers Turkey's independence or its territorial integrity, then the only answer the Turkish people will give is to take up arms to defend the country until death. Although the world situation is unstable, it seems that our country is not in imminent danger. We are still governed by the desire to maintain good relations with all countries, especially neighboring countries. In the past few days, one incident that has drawn our attention is that a certain foreign organization has published various documents, some of which involve Turkey, and some newspapers have also published these documents and propaganda based on them. The question of the authenticity of these documents cannot disturb the Turkish government or the public, because we firmly believe in the correctness of our policies and understand that any propaganda only proves the correctness of Turkey's policies. We have only one way to deal with those who criticize Turkey based on such documents and attempt to prevent Turkish politicians from implementing their policies, and that is to ignore them. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, the Parliament unanimously voted to trust the government. Many diplomatic personnel were present during the Prime Minister's speech, including the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>

<h3>The U.S. Strengthens Air and Sea Defenses, Prepares to Mobilize the National Guard, the Army and Navy Sign Unprecedented Manufacturing Contracts, and the Two-Ocean Fleet Program Begins to Be Implemented</h3>
<p>Washington: The Navy Department yesterday signed the largest manufacturing contract in history. This is the result of President Roosevelt's statement that he is considering mobilizing the National Guard for further training. The Navy Department signed a contract worth US$136,743,000 to enhance the nation's air defenses and shipping facilities on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. This contract is part of the administration's plan to build 35,000 aircraft for the Army and Navy by July 1, 1942. At the same time, the Army Department signed a contract worth US$46,197,000 yesterday to purchase various important equipment. President Roosevelt told reporters that his proposal to mobilize the National Guard is a new step to strengthen national defense. The President's statement was in response to Army Chief of Staff Marshall's recommendation to the Senate Military Affairs Committee. Marshall suggested that the Senate Military Affairs Committee implement a slightly modified conscription bill to replace the "Burke-Wadsworth" bill currently under discussion in Congress. Marshall's bill would require all men in the country from the ages of 18 to 65 to register. He stated that if this bill is implemented, the Army will need another 350,000 men by September, in addition to the 400,000 National Guard troops. General Marshall also stated that once the National Guard is expanded to 400,000 men, they will undergo one year of rigorous training in accordance with the conscription law. If this conscription law is implemented, the Army will immediately conscript 300,000 to 400,000 men and conscript the same number next April. He also announced that by October 1941, the Army Department hopes to conscript an additional 600,000 men, bringing the total number of new recruits to between 1.2 million and 1.41 million. The current authorized strength of the regular army is 280,000 men, but it is widely believed that the conscription law is now in progress so that it can reach 375,000, which is the number specifically approved by Congress. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt told reporters that the U.S. National Guard will undergo a partial mobilization in the near future for training purposes, but only if Congress approves this plan. Roosevelt has discussed the details with the new Secretary of War, Stimson. According to reliable sources, a portion of the National Guard will be mobilized, including anti-aircraft artillery units and harbor defense units. The official announcement regarding the duration of service has not yet been released, but those close to the Army Department stated that the term is approximately one year. In addition to general military training, training on the use of modern weapons will also be conducted simultaneously. People here believe that the U.S. government's plan is a preparatory step for adopting a compulsory military training system. (Haitong dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Washington: The U.S. Navy Department has recently ordered warships worth a total of $137,000,000, breaking the record for peacetime shipbuilding. This is part of the U.S. program to build a two-ocean fleet in the Pacific and Atlantic. U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall also told the Senate Military Affairs Committee today that if the U.S. regular army and National Guard are to be increased to a sufficient strength, it is necessary to implement compulsory military training immediately. An Army Department official also told the committee that if Congress enacts a military training bill, the Army will have 930,000 men in training by October 1, and this number could increase to 1,415,000 by next April.

<p>Washington: According to an announcement by the Army Department, the establishment of the Ninth "Streamlined" Division is the final step to be implemented according to the current plan. Countless other new units will also be organized. It is expected that the strength of the standing army will increase by 55,000 men, so it is possible to engage in this effort.

<h3>Germany Will Publicly Challenge the Pan-American Conference</h3>
<p>Washington: Government officials here announced last night that they have gathered some evidence that German representatives will publicly challenge the "Monroe Doctrine" at this month's Havana Conference of American Republics. Officials here believe that the "warnings" issued to several Latin American countries may be a prelude to Germany's intensified efforts to disrupt the Western Hemisphere when the Havana Conference convenes (the "warnings" stated that Germany hopes they will advocate neutrality favorable to Germany at the conference). Officials here have also received intelligence that German representatives may use force in Havana, as they did at the First Conference of American Republics in Panama City last month on the ninth. The representatives at the Havana Conference will discuss the economic and territorial issues in the Western Hemisphere caused by the European war. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3>Who Won the Mexican Election? Camacho Received the Most Votes, Almazán Claims to Have Been Elected</h3>
<p>Mexico City: A strange situation has occurred in the Mexican presidential election. According to the vote count, Camacho received the vast majority of the votes in the country, but his opponent, General Almazán, claims that he is the victor. According to custom, the official election results will be announced on September 11 in the House of Representatives, but newspapers are now forced to publish notices stating that General Almazán believes that he has been legally elected and intends to establish his own congress. It has been confirmed that representatives have been issued. The advertisement also stated that the congress will convene in a place to be announced later to declare General Almazán as president, and then he will be sworn in, and Camacho's party will not be allowed to take any action in the formal legislature. What is concerning now is that if President Cárdenas cannot resolve this matter, the old turmoil in Mexico will occur again. (Reuters dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<h3>The Chicago Convention Will Begin Tomorrow, Roosevelt Declares He Will Not Attend, But Refuses to State His Attitude on Re-election</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt declared yesterday that he would not personally attend the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next week, but he again refused to state his attitude on a third term. The Democratic convention will be held in Chicago on Monday, but the first few days will be routine speeches and the announcement of the party platform. The formal vote to elect a presidential candidate to oppose Republican candidate Willkie will not be held until Thursday. Political observers last night still expressed doubts about the President's true intentions. If the President once declares that he will relinquish his right to be elected, it will cause a reaction from countless hopeful presidential candidates in Chicago, because they do not want to compete with President Roosevelt, and will indefinitely suspend their campaigns. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Chicago: Democratic officials reported last night that Senator Byrnes of South Carolina and Secretary of Commerce Hopkins, after arriving here from Washington yesterday, have begun to prepare everything to involve the President in the campaign and make him the third master of the White House. Mr. Hopkins moved into the Blackstone Hotel, which is the hub for communication between the convention and the White House. Mr. Byrnes is staying at the Stevens Hotel across the street. According to reports, he will preside over all matters related to the third term. Hopkins and Byrnes stated that President Roosevelt will not comment on re-election unless the convention formally elects the President as a candidate. It is believed here that since the President announced that he would not attend the convention, the re-election campaign is trying to avoid any suspicion of directly taking orders from the President by telephone. However, it is rumored here that Hopkins and Byrnes have absolute authority to represent the President. At the same time, Senator Wheeler of Montana told 800 cheering Chicago businessmen last night that the Democratic platform must include not dragging the United States into the vortex of war, and the convention delegates must also elect a strong candidate in order to "implement the platform." He stated that he fears that the United States is "heading down the path of 1917, but at a faster and more dangerous pace." Senator Wheeler stated that the only task facing the United States at present is to maintain a democratic policy in the Americas and solve its own economic problems. The most important economic problem is to increase mass consumption, so that farmers and employees have the opportunity to purchase various necessary and luxury goods. (United Press dispatch from the 13th)</p>
<p>Washington: When President Roosevelt met with reporters today, he firmly stated that he would not go to Chicago to attend the Democratic convention. When reporters asked what his intentions would be if he were elected to a third term as president, President Roosevelt avoided answering this question and went on to say that he was planning to discuss the mobilization of the National Guard with Secretary of War Stimson today. If President Roosevelt is indeed a candidate, his only competitors in the Democratic nomination will be Vice President Garner or Postmaster General Farley, but it is widely believed that these two have very little hope of competing with President Roosevelt. Isolationist Senator Wheeler, who had threatened to form another "Peace Party," has also issued a statement saying that he will support the candidate nominated by the party and there is no question of organizing a third party. If President Roosevelt refuses to accept the Democratic nomination for a third term as president, the Chicago convention will become a place of chaos and party strife. At present, it is generally believed that the convention's nomination of President Roosevelt is almost certain. If he agrees to accept it, the main focus of the convention will be the nomination of the vice president and the drafting of the party platform. As for the vice presidential candidate, it will be either a strong supporter of the New Deal or a Southern Democrat. If the latter is elected, it will unite the conservatives of the party. If a supporter of the New Deal is elected, then the rumor that the president may resign after the world crisis has passed, so that the vice president can succeed to the White House, will be more credible. The nomination of Secretary of State Hull as a candidate for vice president would be welcomed by Southern Democrats. If a person who supports the New Deal is chosen, then Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Douglas has the loudest voice. (Reuters dispatch from the 12th)</p>
<p>Washington: Although President Roosevelt will not go to Chicago to attend the Democratic National Convention, no one doubts that the convention is under his control. President Roosevelt will remotely control everything in Washington. President Roosevelt will be a politician in political history who keeps the secret of his will to run for a third term, but on the eve of the opening of the convention, it was finally revealed with a hint. If President Roosevelt refuses to run for election now, it will be a huge disaster for the Democratic Party and throw its campaign into chaos. Failure in the election in November may be inevitable. President Roosevelt has not even hinted at his will to his family, which has caused other presidential hopefuls in the Democratic Party to lose their chance to compete. Therefore, the leaders gathered in Chicago feel slightly uneasy and need to make an announcement to indicate that Roosevelt intends to run for re-election in order to boost the morale of the entire party and prevent the competitive Republicans from gaining an advantage. President Roosevelt's recent remarks on the Monroe Doctrine, regardless of the isolationist Senator Wheeler's leadership, may be a torpedo in the possible third "Peace" Party. President Roosevelt also recently made a vow not to send troops to Europe. This has caused all efforts by Republicans to attach the label of warmonger to Roosevelt to fail.

<h3>Anti-American Movement Occurs in Taipei, U.S. Considers Withdrawing Consulate Staff</h3>
<p>Tokyo: It was learned here last night that an anti-American demonstration occurred in Taipei, Taiwan Island, last week. The incident was triggered by the detention of Matsuo, a secretary at the U.S. Consulate, and a dispute arose between the U.S. and Japan. Matsuo has been working at the U.S. Consulate for 22 years. A few weeks ago, he was arrested for investigating the number of registered cars in Taiwan with the local Japanese authorities. It is said that this information was included in the routine consular report submitted to Washington. Although Matsuo did not obtain the car information, he was sentenced to three years in prison for violating military secrets. The State Department has repeatedly protested to the Japanese government, but has not been able to get this case reconsidered. If Japan continues its current attitude, the United States will be prepared to consider withdrawing the staff of the U.S. Consulate in Taipei. Since Matsuo's arrest, the U.S. Consulate in Taipei has stopped issuing passports, health certificates, and consular export certificates to Japanese ships sailing from Taiwan to the United States. Japanese ships are subject to fines upon arrival in the United States without these documents. An anti-American demonstration occurred there last week. When the public marched past the U.S. Consulate, they shouted slogans cursing the U.S. Consul Warner. It is said that the United States attaches great importance to this incident, because if the same incident occurs in Japanese territory, it will intimidate Japanese employees and hinder the daily work of the U.S. Consulate staff.

<h3>A Letter from an American Reporter Reveals the Reasons for France's Defeat, The Retreat Without a Fight at the Meuse River Was a Fatal Blow, Laval Strongly Opposed the Idea of ​​Relocating the Capital Overseas</h3>
<p>New York: A letter was received here yesterday from an American reporter, which vividly described how the German mechanized forces caused the French army to be defeated, and how Laval, now the Deputy Prime Minister of France, prevented the French government from relocating to North Africa. From the time the German army crossed the Meuse River to the time France and Germany concluded the armistice agreement, the reporter witnessed it all. The letter is recorded as follows: "The sudden defeat of the French army is indeed a very shocking event, but looking back on the past, I have realized that Hitler may have already known that the French army could not defeat the powerful German army. The turning point was when the German army crossed the Meuse River. The achievement of the so-called 'encirclement battle' was not only surprising to the French, but also to the Germans themselves. The German army did not regard this kind of 'encirclement battle' as the main war. Its purpose was to force the French army to send back its troops fighting in Belgium, with the clear intention of breaking through the defenses there (referring to the Meuse River). The German army only used half a mechanized division to attack the Meuse River defense troops, totaling 6,000 soldiers, 200 tanks, and 1,500 other vehicles. At that time, the German army seemed to be only testing the military strength of the area. Upon reaching the river, they found that the French army had abandoned all the intact bridges and retreated. So the German army ordered the tanks to cross the bridge and widen the bridgehead. Twelve hours later, although British pilots bombed the bridges on the river, it was too late, because the French army had already retreated, and the German army could build pontoon bridges over the river. At this time, the situation took a sharp turn, and the German tanks immediately drove towards Laon and Soissons. The reporter was in a certain army headquarters at the time and heard rumors that the German army had broken through the French defenses. Although it was generally acknowledged that the two French divisions defending the Meuse River line were very poor, and most of them were Parisians, no one believed that the German army could break through the defenses. (Note: Half of the two French divisions were busy working in the fields and in sugar factories in the rear.) Afterwards, it should have been easier to prevent the advance of the German motorized teams on the Somme River, but most of the war equipment was lost when retreating from Belgium, so that there was a shortage of military fire and guns. Shooting tanks with Lebel rifles and machine guns is like shooting sharks with blunt bows and arrows. How can it be effective? The scene of the French government relocating the capital was also very puzzling. Among the politicians who advocated first moving to Tours and then to Bordeaux, Laval was the main figure. At that time, other people advocated moving to Africa, but Laval alone thought it was impossible and still wanted the French government to stay in France. Laval, who has long been known to advocate French-Italian cooperation, then summoned members of the Senate and House of Representatives to see President Lebrun. At that time, Laval's words and actions could control everything. Laval pointed out that he believed that once the leaders of France left, the result would be that tens of millions of French people would be controlled by the Germans, and their lives and deaths would be determined by the Germans. Laval's argument was effective, and many government officials were more convinced that it was reasonable to stay in France. Laval also warned the cabinet members that he would never leave France, and after the war, Laval also advocated that the parliament punish all the members who fled, because at that time, 25 members had left France."

<h3>On the Eve of the Democratic National Convention in America, Roosevelt's Attitude is Subtle</h3>
<p>Have the changes in Europe over the past few months dispelled President Roosevelt's unwillingness to run for a third term? What is the effect of President Roosevelt remaining silent on the issue of a third term until the eve of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago?</p>
<p>If Roosevelt decides to run, it will not be due to the persuasion of his close associates, but rather because of his political opponents. This attitude has had two effects: he has prevented the "tycoons" of the major city party branches from supporting party chairman Farley (the current Postmaster General), and he has prevented the reactionaries within the Democratic Party from raising their heads. In other words, Roosevelt has made preparations that allow him to advance or retreat freely.</p>
<p>Farley's announcement that he would participate in the nomination race was, from his perspective, a bizarre adventure. His decision to challenge Roosevelt suggests that he was confident of a considerable chance of being elected. However, he is likely mistaken in some respects. This is because he is blinded by his position. The control that he enjoys over the party branches as party chairman will be lost invisibly when he uses it for his own benefit instead of for the benefit of the true leader.</p>
<p>Roosevelt has made it clear that he does not object to Farley or anyone else participating in the election, but that no one can use the party apparatus for their own convenience.</p>
<p>The so-called "tycoons" of the district party branches are people like Edward Kelly of Chicago and Frank Hague of Jersey City. It is very interesting that they are warning Farley and the reactionaries in the party by prioritizing public opinion over the party branch. The tycoons of the district party branches were originally in control of everything, rather than relying on others. The fact that they accepted public opinion, rose up to support Roosevelt, and opposed Farley shows where the authority within the Democratic Party lies. The success of this struggle was also proven in the Wisconsin and Illinois primaries, where the delegates unanimously supported Roosevelt and opposed Farley and Vice President Garner.</p>
<p>Now that Roosevelt has completed these preparations, he knows that his policies will be continued by someone. If he finally announces his retirement, America's strength in international relations will not be adversely affected. He may even be able to control the Democratic National Convention and decide on a successor, in other words, ensure that a New Deal proponent, rather than a conservative from the South or an isolationist from the Midwest, is elected.</p>
<p>This choice of candidate was originally waiting to see who the Republican Party would nominate for president. According to the original plan, if the Republican Party nominated New York District Attorney Dewey, then the Democratic Party would compete with him using Secretary of the Interior Ickes or New York Mayor LaGuardia. If the Republican Party nominated Senators Taft or Vandenberg, then the Democratic Party was prepared to oppose them with Senator Wallace. Now that the Republican Party has put forward a "Dark Horse," Willkie, the Democratic Party's original plan will inevitably be overturned.</p>
<p>In short, the American election situation still depends on whether the international situation is more important than domestic affairs. At present, as Secretary of State Hull said, American domestic affairs cannot compare to the international situation. President Roosevelt also has great power in his hands, and his "yes or no" truly carries immense weight.</p>

<h3>The Cost of the European War</h3>
<p>According to British Chancellor of the Exchequer Hore-Belisha's announcement in Parliament, Britain's daily military expenditure is £7.5 million, which is equivalent to US$28,125,000, or approximately 46,875,000 Chinese legal tender. According to American reports, 250 German planes bombed Paris, killing 254 people and dropping 2,060 bombs, worth approximately US$265,000. Sixteen planes were shot down, worth approximately US$2.5 million. Dividing this among the 254 dead, each person gets US$10,840.</p>
<h3>British Children</h3>
<p>The British government is in contact with the various dominions to evacuate 20,000 children to safe locations, with 10,000 planned to be sent to Canada, 5,000 to Australia, and the rest to New Zealand and South Africa. Although their parents will not accompany them, they will be escorted by warships across the vast ocean, how tragic and magnificent!</p>

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Department of Education Subsidizes Meal Expenses for Middle School Students and Provides Relief to Families in War Zones Unable to Support Themselves</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Airmail) In view of the rising cost of living, the Guangdong Provincial Government believes that it is urgent to increase the subsidies for meal expenses of middle school students withdrawn from war zones in order to maintain their studies. Therefore, the Department of Education has proposed a revision of the "Provisional Measures for Subsidizing Meal Expenses for War Zone Students in Guangdong Province Middle Schools," which was passed and implemented by the Provincial Council. The main points are as follows: (1) Any middle school student whose family is in a war zone and whose source of income has been cut off, and who has been duly proven to require relief, may apply to the school for a subsidy. However, students receiving public funding or students who have been held back in the current semester are not eligible to apply. (2) The meal subsidy is divided into two amounts: full amount and half amount. The full amount is 9 yuan in national currency per month, and the half amount is 4.5 yuan in national currency per month. (3) Students may apply for a meal subsidy once per semester. (4) The school principal should select several faculty and staff members to form a committee to subsidize student meal expenses to review the eligibility of students applying for meal subsidies. The school will then prepare four copies of the budget and two copies of the student meal expense request form, along with the stamp, and submit them for verification. The full semester's meal expenses will be issued in one lump sum and distributed by the school. (5) The number of students requesting full and half subsidies should, in principle, each account for one-third of the total number of students withdrawn from the war zone. (6) The student meal subsidy is issued in two installments each year: the first installment is from January to July, and the second installment is from August to December. (7) Students whose school registration has not been confirmed are not eligible for a meal subsidy. However, if the school's reporting procedures have not been completed, resulting in the student's school registration not being verified in a timely manner, the meal subsidy may still be issued at the school's request for the sake of providing prompt relief. However, if the student's school registration is found to be non-compliant and should be removed, the school will be responsible for returning the meal subsidy that has been received in full. (8) The meal subsidy for provincial schools is provided by the Department of Education. The meal subsidy for county, municipal, or district schools is, in principle, provided by the county or municipal government. The Department of Education may provide subsidies at its discretion when necessary. (9) If a student receiving a meal subsidy receives financial support from their family, the subsidy should be stopped immediately.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Department of Education Plans to Establish a Wartime Art Museum</h3>
<p>(Shaoguan Airmail) The Guangdong Department of Education is planning to establish a Guangdong Provincial Wartime Art Museum. Preparations began in July, and it is expected to be established in August. The director will be concurrently held by Huang Linshu, the Director of the Department of Education. The first phase of basic trainees will temporarily accept 24 people, who will be admitted through an examination selection process. The training period is half a year. As for the 50 trainees recommended for training in the first phase, they will be selected by the Department of Education's various working teams and public secondary schools and above. Those interested in art work will be admitted to the museum for training, and each political working team established by the political organs may also recommend trainees for training. Each trainee will pay miscellaneous fees of 2 yuan per month. The museum will provide accommodation, while meal expenses and all other expenses will be borne by the original recommending organization.</p>

<h3>Examination for Poor Students to be Announced on the 25th</h3>
<p>The Student Relief Committee organized by the Shanghai Chinese Christian YMCA held a registration for poor students to help poor students in colleges and above, and senior high schools. As a result of the registration of poor students in this city applying for further education, there were more than 800 students. The examination was held on the afternoon of the 8th of this month at 7:00 pm. According to Miss Fei, the clerk of the association, the results of the registration examination were expected to be announced in the near future. However, due to the large number of candidates and the fact that the examination papers are still being reviewed by the committee, and the registration examination of this session is not based on the test of excellence, but also the family conditions of each student must be investigated to determine whether they are truly poor. The investigation will take time, so the announcement will be postponed to the 25th of this month.</p>

<h3>Hezhong Cup Basketball Game Yesterday: Paramount Soundly Defeats Qunyi; The Battle Was One-Sided and Easy to Win; Today's Game A1 Baille vs. Nanyang</h3>
<p>In yesterday's Hezhong Cup charity basketball game, the A1 group Paramount played against Qunyi. Paramount, with the momentum of three wins in three games, could not be stopped by Qunyi, which had repeatedly lost. Paramount led all the way, ending the first half with a score of 35 to 13. After changing sides, Qunyi tried hard to struggle, but it was one step behind and was eventually defeated by Paramount with a score of 42 to 75. Today, there were originally two games, but due to the A1 group Qingguang vs. Youlian, Youlian applied for postponement. Therefore, there is only one game left in the A2 group Baille vs. Nanyang, which will start at 6:30 pm. Tickets are 5 jiao. The battle situation yesterday was as follows:</p>
<p>Paramount Leads Remotely. Under the mobilization order, Paramount's Zhang Shaoqing scored the opening record with a free throw. Then Chen Xianglong cut through three levels with his knife. Paramount scored seven points, and Qunyi scored zero. Before long, Wang Jinghu committed a foul, and Qunyi's Chuan Xiangrui got one point for free. Tao Shaosheng tried the basket for the first time, and the net broke in response. Shaoqing and Xiangrui scored successively, and the difference was still four points. After that, Qunyi repeatedly failed to score, while Paramount's score soared. At the end of the first half, Paramount led with 35 to 13.</p>
<p>Qunyi Suffers a Miserable Defeat. As the second battle began, Qunyi's He Xiaoxian announced the registration first. Paramount's Lu Feng returned the salute twice as much. After Du Ziren scored four points, Qunyi collapsed again. Paramount was like entering a no-man's land, 57 to 18. Qunyi's situation was even more precarious. In conclusion, Qunyi was defeated by Paramount with a score of 42 to 75.</p>

<h3>Newspaper Frankly Discusses Peace, Acknowledges Chinese Fighting Strength, Subtly Explains the Advantages and Disadvantages of Sino-Japanese Peace and War, and Knows that Partial Peace is of No Avail</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese war has been going on for three years. Looking back on the past, we will try to compare the attitudes of both China and Japan towards the war, measure their psychology, and log the facts. This is indeed a meaningful and interesting matter. Since Japan launched its war of aggression against China, it initially shouted wildly about "conquering China in three months," and then claimed a "hundred-year war." In the meantime, there were also arrogant words such as "must fight until China kneels." The sound of gnashing teeth was almost audible. However, in the past six months, what has been heard has changed to "ending the war against China." Looking back at China, "resisting to the end," only these four characters have remained unchanged, ringing and sonorous. The secret here is not difficult to discern. Recently, the Japanese side has become increasingly tired and its desire for peace has become more urgent. At first, it was still hesitant and secretive, but now it has become increasingly frank. The English-language newspaper "Hong Kong News" published by the Japanese in Hong Kong published an article on June 30 that revealed the desire for peace. As soon as this article came out, it attracted great attention from Chinese and foreign people. One point in particular, with skillful wording, directly admitted that negotiating peace with a certain party would not help "Sino-Japanese cooperation." This is indeed a public and frank confession from the Japanese side. In this anxious and hesitant state of the Japanese side, the number of wins and losses is very clear. Where should China go from here? There is no need to say more. The general summary of the "Hong Kong News" article is as follows:</p>
<p>Empty Talk About Victory and Defeat</p>
<p>Chongqing politicians have many misunderstandings about the peace that Nanjing and Tokyo are about to begin negotiating. They believe that the restoration of Sino-Japanese peace relations is a matter of shame and must be avoided. This "stupid" view is due to their failure to understand the truth. There is no war that lasts forever. The result of all wars must be peace. In the war between the Chongqing government and Japan, it has indeed been "defeated," but this is by no means a stain on China's glorious history, because since there is war, there must be either defeat or victory.</p>
<p>Subtle Words</p>
<p>War is like a large-scale sports meeting. Victory or defeat is not worth emphasizing. What is needed is that the loser can maintain its sportsmanship. The past is gone, and the future can be pursued. We should not let the mistakes of the past hinder the development of the future. It is time for the Chongqing authorities to recognize the facts.</p>
<p>Praising the Chinese Army</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese peace is the only way to save China. Being defeated does not mean being weak. The Chinese people and their war power have no bad characteristics. If they can restore "reason" at this time, it is not too late to mend the fence after the sheep are lost. We should take this war as a valuable experience and continue to move forward along this path.</p>
<p>Praying for Cooperation</p>
<p>Indeed, if Japan's war goal is to conquer China, then Chongqing should continue to resist. However, Japan has repeatedly stated its upright and bright goals. Konoe has assured China that the Japanese side will never regard itself as a conqueror. Under Konoe's principles, peace will never harm China's "independence." The Chinese people will still enjoy "freedom." However, if the Japanese side suggests that Chongqing "does not participate," then China will still be "divided." China's "division" will not help Sino-Japanese cooperation at all. Japan does not want a "divided" China.</p>
<h3>Today is French National Day, Ceremonies Suspended, Only Flags are Hung to Celebrate, Passed in Solemnity</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the French Democratic Republic. The French expatriates in Shanghai are in a very different situation this year than in previous years. There will be no extravagance. Only flags will be hung to celebrate. Even the lanterns in front of the embassy, consulates, and various patrol rooms have been cancelled without any formal announcement. Therefore, today's National Day commemoration will be passed in solemnity and silence. It is rumored that French Ambassador Cosme and his wife will host a garden party at their private residence on Hague Road. The French Embassy, the French Consulate General, the French Municipal Council, the French Police Department, etc. will all be closed for one day today. However, today happens to be Sunday and it is closed as usual. Tomorrow will be a make-up holiday and will be open as usual on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Every year on the 14th of July, the French National Day, the French Concession Police Department has the practice of promoting and rewarding detectives and staff of all levels, including Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian, who have worked diligently and achieved excellent results. On this year's National Day commemoration, it was found that Zheng Detective Liu Kunbao, Mao Jinsheng, and Chen Shunbao have served for many years and have made excellent contributions, and they were promoted to inspectors. In addition, Deputy Detectives Guo Shaorong, Zhang Chunsheng, Wang Dongwan, Cheng Wangming, Zhang Fengming, and Wang Wenwei have worked diligently and are commendable, and they were each promoted to Zheng Detective. Detectives Weng Huanzhang and Qi Deqing were promoted to Deputy Detectives to show encouragement.</p>
<h3>Incident of Japanese Military Police Detained: Baker Visited Miura Yesterday, It is widely believed that the United States and Japan will issue a joint statement</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Evening Post," Colonel Baker, the commander of the Fourth Regiment of the United States Marine Corps, visited Major General Miura Saburo, the commander of the Japanese Military Police in Shanghai, yesterday to discuss the incident on the "July 7th" anniversary in which U.S. Marines detained sixteen Japanese plainclothes armed soldiers in the defense zone. It is widely believed that Japan and the United States will soon issue a joint statement on this matter. According to a Japanese newspaper, the Japanese authorities were deeply dissatisfied with Colonel Baker's response to Commander Miura some days ago. On the mornings of the 11th and 12th, they twice dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Utsunomiya and Major Hayashi to the U.S. Marine Corps authorities to explain the situation at the time and the Japanese attitude in detail. Regarding the resolution of the incident, the Japanese side insisted that the U.S. Marine Corps authorities should acknowledge their mistake and offer a sincere apology. As for the Japanese residents in Shanghai, they seized the opportunity to stir up anti-American sentiment, clamoring incessantly, with the intention of demanding that the U.S. Marine Corps withdraw from Shanghai.</p>
<p>U.S. Soldiers Prohibited from Wearing Plain Clothes</p>
<p>Furthermore, Colonel Baker issued an order yesterday morning, prohibiting all soldiers under his command from wearing plain clothes. This order took effect last night. Violators of this order will be severely punished. The U.S. commander stated that the issuance of this order was because American soldiers, when going out for entertainment in plain clothes, were often mistaken for bank managers or senior executives of foreign firms. However, observers here believe that the issuance of this order by the U.S. commander at a time when Japanese plainclothes soldiers were detained by the U.S. military and the Japanese side was expressing dissatisfaction was no coincidence. Colonel Baker issued this order to avoid or prevent possible retaliation from the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Plans to Improve the Rickshaw Industry Situation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council believes that the rickshaw industry in the city has recently reached an unsatisfactory state. A special committee has been organized to implement a temporary relief measure. This measure allows rickshaw owners to increase the daily rental fee by 15 cents, from 83 cents to 98 cents, while the Shanghai Municipal Council will increase its subsidy to the mutual aid society by 50 cents per rickshaw per month to support the welfare of rickshaw pullers. According to statistics, there are currently 9,500 rickshaws in the International Settlement and 5,000 in the French Concession, totaling 14,500. With an average of four rickshaw pullers per rickshaw, there are approximately 58,000 rickshaw pullers in the two concessions. Including their families, more than 100,000 people depend on rickshaws for a living. Their income is insufficient to cover their expenses, and their livelihoods are facing great difficulties.</p>
<h3>China-France Airmail Route Suddenly Suspended Yesterday; British Royal Airmail Resumes Flights to Australia and South Africa; Pan American Airways Undertakes to Forward Mail to Europe</h3>
<p>The British Imperial Airways Limited (I.A.L.) suddenly ordered a suspension of flights on June 13 due to the war situation. The Shanghai Post Office was ordered to refuse to accept mail transported by British Imperial Airways aircraft. All airmail destined for various parts of the United Kingdom was rerouted via China-France Airlines to Marseille, and then transferred by ship to London and other parts of the United Kingdom. After the clash between the China-France fleets in Oran Harbour, which strained relations between the two sides, the China-France route continued to operate as usual, but most British and American merchants preferred to have their airmail to the United Kingdom routed through the United States. After repeated consultations with Pan American Airways by the Shanghai Postal Administration and the Kunming Postal General Bureau,</p>
<p>Pan American Airmail is Stable, Fast, and Convenient</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-San Francisco route operated by Pan American Airways is used to transport mail to the United States, and then the company's Atlantic mail route is used to transport it to various European countries. This has been implemented since the 6th of this month. According to inquiries by this newspaper's reporter, airmail delivered via the above route takes about 15 days to reach Europe. The airmail fee is 5.40 yuan per 5 grams. However, it must be noted on the envelope "(By P.A.A. Service Via U.S.A.)".</p>
<p>British Imperial Airways Resumes Mail to Certain Destinations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Post Office yesterday received an urgent telegram from the Postal General Bureau stating that the British Imperial Airways route has resumed mail service to Australia and the Union of South Africa. Subsequently, airmail destined for Australia, the Union of South Africa, the Gold Coast, Kenya, Mozambique, Portuguese East Africa, Northern Rhodesia, Nyasaland, and South Africa, transported by British Imperial Airways and Qantas aircraft, will be accepted again from today. Flights will still depart from Hong Kong. The airmail fee for letters to Australia is 1.30 yuan per 5 grams, and for letters to various parts of South Africa, in addition to the normal letter fee, the airmail fee is 3.40 yuan per 5 grams. As for various parts of Europe, service has not yet resumed and mail will still be routed through the United States. The Post Office has issued Notice No. 1615.</p>
<p>China-France Hanoi Route Temporarily Suspended</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Shanghai Post Office yesterday received a telegram from Hanoi notifying them that the China-France air route (A. ) is temporarily suspended. Therefore, the Post Office has suspended accepting mail from yesterday destined for Hong Kong, Hanoi, or via the Hanoi-Marseille route to various European countries and French territories. Currently, the only airmail route available for mail destined for Singapore, Siam, India, and Bombay is KLM (K.L.M.).</p>
<p>Pan American Exclusively Handles Airmail to Europe</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, yesterday (the 12th) the authorities at the Shanghai Post Office stated that with the suspension of flights by British Imperial Airways and KLM, and the uncertain situation of Air France, airmail destined for Europe via the westward route may be completely suspended. KLM suspended flights last Saturday. As for the situation with Air France, the Post Office is awaiting a reply telegram from Hanoi. However, all westward routes have been temporarily suspended. Airmail sent from Shanghai can still be transported to Europe via Pan American Airways' trans-Atlantic air route, taking approximately 15 days to reach its destination.</p>
<p>Sea Defense Postal Service Has Resumed</p>
<p>After a temporary interruption of the sea defense shipping route, the Shanghai Post Office sent lightweight mail destined for Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shanxi (western part), Shaanxi, Gansu, and areas to the west, Zheng County and areas to the south and west, and Yichang and areas to the west, via Jinhua, Ji'an, and Weiyang. Now that the sea defense route between Shanghai and Haiphong has resumed since the 13th, all mail destined for the above areas will, for convenience, still be routed via Haiphong and Kunming.</p>
<h3>Establishment of Special Wartime Customs Stations to Protect Resources - Decided by the Economic Warfare Department</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen economic administrative efficiency and adapt to the needs of the long-term war of resistance, it has been decided to establish an Economic Warfare Department. It has also been decided to establish special wartime customs stations everywhere from Suiyuan in the north to Guangxi in the south, to complete a "Great Wall of Economic Defense" over 3,000 miles long, in order to prevent the dumping of Japanese goods into the interior and to prevent the smuggling of materials out of the country. The nature of this department is similar to that of the British wartime economic department. It is jointly composed of the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Military Law Department of the Military Affairs Commission, and will be in contact with the military commanders of various guerrilla areas to strictly inspect the entry and exit of goods and prevent the plunder of Chinese resources.</p>
<h3>Police Commissioner Bowen Goes to Weihaiwei for Vacation</h3>
<p>Major Bowen, the Commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police, has requested a six-week leave of absence from the authorities to go to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat. It is understood that he has been approved by his superiors. Commissioner Bowen has purchased a ticket on the SS Shengjing from Butterfield &amp; Swire. The SS Shengjing was detained by the Japanese at Wusongkou for carrying munitions. Commissioner Bowen will first go to Weihaiwei for vacation. During his absence, his duties will be temporarily assumed by Deputy Police Commissioner Smith.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 p.m., the observatory reported that the hurricane had swept past Shanghai at 2:00 p.m., approximately 210 nautical miles to the east. Its position was 31 degrees north latitude and 125 degrees east longitude, and it continued to move in a north-northwesterly direction. The center of the storm was within 60 nautical miles. The threat of a hurricane to Shanghai was completely lifted. At 2:30 p.m., the Jianghai Customs removed the black balls from the Bund rooftop and the Yangshupu signal station, and shipping was officially released. Around 2:00 p.m., as the hurricane began to sweep past east Shanghai, the wind intensified. The wind force was six outside Wusongkou, and approximately three to four within the city. After 4:00 p.m., the wind stabilized. The civilian boats sheltering from the wind at Lujiazui successively returned to their original berths and resumed normal activities.</p>
<p>Shipping Rescheduled</p>
<p>The SS Tai Koo Qiongzhou and SS Jardine Yuesheng, which were scheduled to resume sailing to Haiphong yesterday, have been rescheduled to depart for Haiphong via the bay of Hong Kong and Guangzhou Bay and Haikou this morning. The SS Ningbo Shantai and SS Ningbo Haifu have been rescheduled to depart today.

<p>SS President Coolidge</p>
<p>The American President Lines' SS President Coolidge is generally expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. However, the company's world-class passenger liner SS Artemisia, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from the United States next Tuesday, the 17th, and depart for Hong Kong, Little Luzon, and various parts of Southeast Asia to return to New York, has not yet been reported to have arrived in Shanghai, according to the company, and is likely to be delayed.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Rice Merchants from Mixing Inferior Goods - Regulations on the Marked Price of Foreign Rice - Rice from Ping County Also Being Shipped</h3>
<p>The Rice Price Evaluation Committee held its second evaluation committee meeting the day before yesterday, assessing the highest price of foreign rice at 61.50 yuan, approximately 2 yuan lower than the previous assessment. This has been announced and implemented in the market since yesterday morning. All transactions among market traders must not exceed the price limit. Any instances of secret dealings should be reported to the authorities of the two settlements for punishment. Subsequently, the marked price of all foreign rice is only allowed to increase by 1.50 yuan compared to the price assessed by the Rice Price Evaluation Committee. However, there are still those who mix inferior goods into high-quality rice in an attempt to make a large profit and deceive the public. The authorities have repeatedly issued orders to crack down on this. It is understood that if such incidents occur again, they will be severely punished. It is also understood that the 20,000 bags of foreign rice ordered by the Ping County Committee are already being shipped and are expected to arrive in port around the 20th.</p>
<h3>Italian Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Arrives in Shanghai via the Interior - Takes the Italian Merchant Ship Changde from Ningbo - Arrives in Shanghai for Reporting and Has No Specific Task</h3>

<h3>Japanese Troops Along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway Install Electric Fences - Already Installed in the Changzhou Section - Great Loss of Crops</h3>
<p>A person from Wuxi reported that the day before yesterday at 10:00 a.m., a mobile unit of over 200 men came from the direction of Taihu Lake in the southern district of Wuxi, in the Fangqiao and Banqiao areas, and opened fire at the Ruotang Bridge with the Mei Mingzhang unit of the Nanqiao puppet self-defense corps. The two sides clashed for four hours, and there were casualties on both sides. Currently, along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, the Japanese side, fearing damage from the mobile units, has decided to install iron wire electric fences along both sides of the railway for a distance of 60 meters. Within the electric fence, due to the danger of electric current, rice paddies can no longer be planted, and the planting of tall plants is prohibited, fearing that the mobile units will use the shade of rice, wheat, and mulberry trees to carry out sabotage. Both sides of the railway must be clearly visible. The electric fence has already been installed in the Changzhou section. Work will begin soon from Wangting to Wumu in Wuxi. Residents have no solution for what crops to plant on the land lost within the electric fence. Furthermore, residents within 5 kilometers of the railway, even children over the age of five, must obtain a "County Resident Certificate," otherwise they will not be allowed to reside there.</p>
<h3>French Concession Warns All Shops - Prohibiting Price Increases</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News, the Fair Price Committee, the Police Department, and the Health Department of the French Concession yesterday (the 12th) dispatched personnel to various shops within the French Concession to warn shopkeepers not to arbitrarily raise prices.</p>
<h3>"Special Police" for Road Extension Outside the Settlement - Rumored to be Established Next Month - The Puppet Side to Establish a "Preparatory Committee" Tomorrow - A Large Number of Chinese, British, and Japanese Police Officers to be Incorporated</h3>
<p>The negotiations for road extension outside the settlement have been ongoing for almost a year since their beginning. Throughout this period, the situation has been constantly changing, depending on the Japanese side's attitude, which changes with the times. For example, the establishment of the "Special Police" has been announced several times. However, due to the negotiations over the Land Office files in the past two months, the Japanese and puppet authorities have shelved the almost completed "Special Police" as a means of blackmail, and it seemed to be fading away. Subsequently, the Shanghai Municipal Council implemented a "pacification policy" on the Land Office files and "handed them over" to the puppet side on July 4. The puppet side believes that the relationship between them and the Shanghai Municipal Council is gradually becoming "clear," so the negotiations for the organization of the "Special Police" in West Shanghai have been revived. It is heard that recently, after several negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the puppet side, the situation is gradually taking shape, and it is scheduled to establish a "Preparatory Committee" tomorrow (the 15th) to begin preparatory work. In the future, the "Director" of this "Special Police Department" will be recommended by the puppet side. It is rumored that the puppet side has internally appointed Pan Da to take on this role. The candidates for the "Preparatory Committee" have also been designated. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council will incorporate more than 280 Chinese, British, and Japanese police officers into the "Special Police." According to the puppet side, if the negotiations proceed smoothly in the future, it can be formally established by August 1.</p>
<h3>French Police Officers Rewarded for Service</h3>
<p>On July 11, the French Police Department decided to award bronze medals to the following meritorious personnel in recognition of their achievements: (1) Russian police officer Sakharov, on June 25, 1940, while on duty, spotted a thug committing a crime and running away with a gun. The police officer bravely pursued and arrested him. During the pursuit, both sides exchanged fire, and the criminal was shot several times before being captured. (2) Chinese police officer No. 730, on June 25, 1940, while on duty in front of 118 Rue du Père Robert, suddenly heard gunshots inside a public bus. He immediately pursued the criminal in a vehicle. During the pursuit, both sides exchanged fire, and the criminal was shot several times before being captured. (3) Chinese police officer No. 302, on June 25, 1940, while patrolling Rue du Père Robert, suddenly heard gunshots inside a public bus. He tracked down the criminal and bravely pursued him. During the pursuit, both sides exchanged fire, and the criminal was shot several times before being captured. This officer was also awarded a second-class medal by the Shanghai Municipal Council for his brave actions.</p>
<h3>Japanese and French Police Jointly Search Wireless Radio Room - Inspect Radio Equipment and Leave Without Taking Anything</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News, the French Police Department, at the request of the Japanese authorities, dispatched police officers along with some Japanese military police to a Chinese wireless radio room at 67 Route Tenant de la Tour at 7:00 a.m. this morning (the 13th) to inspect the various wireless radio equipment. They then left without taking anything. However, it is widely believed that the Japanese authorities oppose the existence of this wireless radio room because they suspect it is under the jurisdiction of the Chinese government.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing and Xiaoshan Relief Society to Hold a Fundraising Conference Today - Ping County Fundraising Committee to Launch Entertainment Program to Raise Donations</h3>
<p>The Shaoxing and Xiaoshan Relief Society is scheduled to hold its second fundraising conference at 3:00 p.m. today at the Shaoxing Association Hall at 330 Avenue Edward VII, hoping that enthusiastic people will actively participate. Furthermore, according to Mr. Zhu Chengxun, a committee member of the society, to the Pingming News Agency, the Ping County Donation Fundraising Committee is scheduled to convene a conference in the near future to pass fundraising measures. The measures are determined to be inviting famous Shanghai opera and Cantonese opera performers to perform, and holding painting and calligraphy exhibitions and charity sales. He also stated that recently, due to the severe rice shortage in Shaoxing and Xiaoshan, local celebrities have come to Shanghai to escape the disaster. However, these people, after escaping the disaster to Shanghai, have mostly not given any assistance to their suffering fellow villagers. He deeply hopes that these people will be enlightened and generously donate. Regarding the Relief Society's relief for the 500,000 starving people in the impoverished classes, if calculated at 6 yuan per person, it would require 18 million yuan for six months, which would be difficult. Therefore, it is planned to appeal to all sectors of the country for assistance. The Relief Society hopes that all sectors will donate large quantities of epidemic prevention medicines, as the situation with epidemics in Shaoxing and Xiaoshan, with cases of cholera, typhoid fever, and other diseases, is as high as 50 cases per week.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Prohibits Employees of Belligerent Countries from Taking Long Leave - Only Allowed to Travel in the Far East</h3>
<p>This morning, a spokesman for the Shanghai Municipal Council stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities continue to prohibit employees of belligerent countries from taking long leave. At the same time, the spokesman denied rumors that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities are discussing the issue of restoring the permission for the above-mentioned employees to take long leave. The spokesman continued that the above-mentioned employees are only allowed to take leave to travel in the Far East. The authorities only reimburse the cost of travel to Japan. The Shanghai Municipal Council authorities have not attempted to allow employees to take leave to travel to Australia, Canada, or the United States. However, some employees believe that the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities will consider this issue in the near future.</p>
<h3>British Embassy Hosts Viewing of European War Films for Various Sectors</h3>

<h3>French Plane Crashes in Guangzhou Bay - Rumored to Have Been Shot Down by Japanese Military - Japanese Inspector and French Military Officer Both Killed - Shanghai Japanese Authorities Claim Bad Weather</h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the French authorities in Shanghai received reliable information last night (the 12th) that a French Airlines mail plane, which was specially chartered to transport a Japanese inspector from Hanoi to Guangzhou Bay on the 7th of this month, was shot down by a Japanese military aircraft while flying over the island of Hainan, occupied by the Japanese military, and crashed somewhere near the island. It is heard that fire was also opened on the plane from Hainan Island. Two well-known French military officers from Shanghai were on board, one being Captain Bocard, a director of the Hon Gai Coal Company, and the other being Lieutenant Testard, the godson of Mr. Flourens, the head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Shanghai French Concession Police Department. What is remarkable is that Lieutenant Testard was born in Guangzhou Bay, left the bay several years ago, and this was his first return to the area.</p>
<p>Unexpected Disaster</p>
<p>In addition to the above two and a Japanese inspector, it is widely believed that the pilot, mechanic, and wireless operator of the plane have also died. The information received in Shanghai about this tragedy is unclear. However, it is heard that the plane was flying in fog, lost its way, and unintentionally flew over Hainan Island, where it was immediately fired upon from the ground. A Japanese aircraft also took off to pursue it. The French aircraft was hit and crashed. The wreckage has not been found. According to reports, Bocard previously resided in Hong Kong and occasionally came to Shanghai. Upon the outbreak of the war, he enlisted in the French army and became a captain. His brother is the head of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council. Testard was born in Guangzhou Bay in 1912. His biological father served as the Customs Commissioner of the Shanghai Jianghai Customs in 1914, but abandoned his post and joined the army when World War I broke out, serving as a pilot. He was later killed in the French Champagne aerial battle. Furthermore, the Shanghai Times reported that Lieutenant Testard was born on May 20, 1912, and graduated from the French Saint-Cyr Military Academy in 1933. In 1936, he was assigned to serve in the French army stationed in Vietnam. Moreover, the English-language North China Daily News reported that the Japanese military authorities in Shanghai this morning (the 13th) refused to comment on the report that a French mail plane was shot down by a Japanese fighter plane over Hainan Island. It was stated that without receiving official information from Hainan Island, they could not comment on the matter. So far, the information circulating in Shanghai is contradictory. One account stated that the misfortune occurred when</p>
<p>Bad Weather</p>
<p>Another account did not mention this point. A Japanese official said that he did not believe the French plane would be shot down by a Japanese aircraft, and that it was likely that the French plane was forced to land due to bad weather and was damaged. However, the French authorities in Shanghai stated that the message released by the Japanese side yesterday (the 12th) was a "formal and complete" message.</p>
<h3>Li Yuying's Sudden Death Case: Prosecutor's Office Investigated Yesterday, Obvious Doubts About the Cause of Death, Both Defendants Released on Bail for Further Review</h3>
<p>Li Shizhen, a frail old man from Fupingtan, residing at No. 74, Lane 41, Route Doumer, had a daughter named Li Yuzhen, also known as Jieru, who was 31 years old this year. She worked as a nurse at Xiehe Hospital. In 1933, she was hired by the Sino-Western Sanatorium at No. 536 Xiaoshi Road as the head nurse, initially earning a monthly salary of 60 yuan, which was later increased to 300 yuan due to her diligent service. Because she supported a family of eight, she was determined to remain single and had saved over ten thousand yuan in cash and jewelry. Since she started working at the sanatorium, all her meals and accommodation were provided by the sanatorium. On the Dragon Boat Festival, June 10th of this year, she went home in the evening to visit her family and returned to the sanatorium to sleep. The next morning, around 10 a.m., her nephew, Li Konglan (17 years old), came to the sanatorium to get an injection from her. When he knocked on the door, there was no response. Therefore, Lu Zhenqing (from Beiping, 39 years old this year), the sanatorium's business manager and son of the sanatorium's director Lu Zhong'an, used a key to open the door and enter the room. He discovered that Li Yuying was lying stiff on the bed, her body cold. Lu immediately ordered Li Konglan to go home and report the news, but he did not report it to the police station according to the regulations of the concession hospital. Later, he ordered the sanatorium's doctor, Lin Zhengliang (38 years old, from Ningbo), to issue a certificate stating that Li Yuying had died of apoplexy. He then notified the Haig Road Chinese Funeral Home to collect and casket the body, and the coffin was temporarily placed in the funeral home. They had found a burial plot at the Hongqiao Cemetery and were planning to choose a date for burial when a person named Lei Huayun sent letters to the French Concession Police Department, the Second Special District Court, and the Fujian Fellow Villagers Association, secretly reporting that Li Yuying had died suddenly under unclear circumstances and requesting them to uphold justice and thoroughly investigate the matter to seek justice for the deceased. After receiving the letter, the French Concession Police Department sent detectives to investigate the Sino-Western Sanatorium and the Chinese Funeral Home, but found no conclusive evidence. They then ordered the police station to transport the coffin to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for an autopsy and reported it to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special District Court, which commissioned Prosecutor Zhao Changmin to open the coffin and examine the body.</p>
<p>Because the body had already undergone surgery by the funeral home, and the skin and flesh of the whole body were tight and hard, the exact cause of death could not be determined. However, Lu Zhenqing was suspected of concealing the sudden death and not reporting it to the police station, and Lin Zhengliang was suspected of issuing a certificate without authorization. The detectives were ordered to take Lu and Lin back to the police station for investigation before further review. Details of the case were previously reported. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Zhao of the Second Special District Court convened the relevant parties to the Criminal Court No. 2 for interrogation and investigation. According to the deceased's father, Li Shizhen, my daughter had always been healthy. When she parted with her family on the Dragon Boat Festival, she was still laughing and talking happily.</p>
<p>There was nothing unusual.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, she died suddenly that night. According to my grandson Li Konglan, who witnessed it, my daughter's death was characterized by her hands being clenched and straight, bent as if resisting, her face was cyanotic, there were traces of blood on her lips, she was wearing a vest, and her lower body was exposed, but the quilt was neatly arranged, clearly indicating a sudden death. He also requested that lawyers Zhuang Dingxun and Li Zhongdao be appointed to represent him in court and requested the court to return his daughter's estate, including 8,700 yuan in cash, four gold bracelets, one gold ring, over thirty silver dollars, three fountain pens, one gold chain, one watch, a radio, one camera, seven large and small leather suitcases, four leather garments, over two hundred pieces of clothing, and one ton of coal, five dan of rice, etc. The court interrogated the two defendants separately. First, Lu Zhenqing testified that he and the deceased had always had a good relationship. On the night of her death, he advised her to go to bed early and did not know what disease she died of. He originally intended to perform an autopsy, but the deceased's family was very superstitious and firmly refused, so he did not perform an autopsy. Later, he ordered Doctor Lin to issue a certificate stating that the deceased died of apoplexy to avoid trouble. He was evasive in his other testimonies. Then, Lin Zhengliang testified that he was unaware of the facts and was ordered by Lu Zhenqing to issue the certificate. Because Lu was also a doctor and had already examined the body and determined that she had apoplexy, he signed the certificate as instructed, and he was unaware of anything else. At this point, Li Shizhen reiterated to the court that his whole family had never signed the certificate, nor did he ask Lu to issue it. The funeral arrangements at the Chinese Funeral Home were also made solely by Lu. To date, the funeral expenses of 1,540.42 yuan, the coffin storage fee of 624 yuan, and the alcohol expenses of 20 yuan at the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home have not been paid and should be Lu's responsibility. After the court summoned Li Konglan to testify about what he had witnessed, the court decided to postpone the investigation. Lu Zhenqing was released on bail with 1,000 yuan in cash and a business guarantor, and Lin Zhengliang was released on bail with 800 yuan in cash and a written business guarantor. If they could not provide bail, they would be detained. The court informed both parties that the Prosecutor's Office had the authority to handle the case according to the law and would not be lenient. Other criminal matters could be referred to the administrative authorities for investigation.</p>
<h3>Western Shanghai Area: Hotbed of Vice, All Entertainment and Dance Venues Use Gambling as Bait</h3>
<p>Since the Incident, western Shanghai has become a special area. Gambling dens are everywhere. Although it has been repeatedly rumored that they will all be closed down, they are still openly operating as usual. Not only are these large-scale venues ubiquitous, such as Hollywood, Zhaofeng, Yuyuan, Qiuyuan, and Rongsheng gambling dens, which have recently changed their signs and continue to operate, luring people into their traps. Even the entertainment and dance venues in the area all use gambling as bait. For example, Yuyuantai at No. 1051 Yuyuan Road, Wilder, Midnight Garden, WilderCom, and more than a dozen small dance halls along Yuyuan Road are ostensibly for dancing and entertainment, but in reality, they all have poker games inside, luring tourists into the game to profit from them, causing great harm. Westerners call this area the "Monte Carlo of Shanghai," which is very accurate.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road Ciyong Lane: Major Fire Yesterday Morning, Houses Destroyed, Significant Losses</h3>
<p>On the ground floor of Building No. 4, Ciyong Lane, No. 450 Nanjing Road, Public Concession, were located the Yi Ji and Rong Kang medicinal materials shops. The upper floors were occupied by the Xia De and Pu Bao firms. At 5:30 a.m. yesterday, a sudden fire broke out in the Xia De and Pu Bao firms on the upper floors. Because the pu bao (reed mats) were flammable, the fire quickly spread. At the same time, the medicinal materials stacked on the ground floor were even more flammable, so the fire became uncontrollable. The flames soared into the sky. After receiving the news, the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene, but the fire had already spread to the neighboring buildings at No. 6, Qingsheng, Hongda, and Tongkang, three cotton cloth shops. Fortunately, the weather was hot, and the residents had already gotten up, so no one was injured. As a result, the fire was extinguished at around 7:30 a.m. Nos. 4 and 6 were completely destroyed. The losses were said to be substantial. Afterwards, the police took the source of the fire to the police station to investigate the cause of the fire.</p>
<h3>Failing to Repay Debt, Pushing to Death</h3>
<p>Min Zhengren, a 40-year-old man from Suzhou, lived at No. 4, Tongle Lane, Route Poncet, French Concession. His brother-in-law, Pan Wulong, 64 years old, came to Shanghai from Suzhou two years ago to escape the chaos and stayed with Min. Min was in financial straits and often borrowed money from Pan to supplement his household expenses. Over the years, the amount was quite large. At 8:40 p.m. yesterday, Pan asked Min to repay the loan. Min not only refused to repay but also resorted to violence, pushing Pan with force. Because Pan was old and unsteady on his feet, he fell to the ground by the window, shattering the glass window. A piece of broken glass pierced Pan's abdomen, and he bled profusely. His family rushed him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but he died before reaching the hospital due to excessive blood loss.</p>
<h3>Social News</h3>
<p>Raided Drug Den</p>
<p>At 9:30 p.m. the night before last, the French Concession Police Department dispatched a large number of detectives to raid No. 59, Ruifu Lane, Zilaihuo Street. As a result, more than 250 packets of morphine were seized, and a drug dealer named Ma Ding (27 years old) from Ningbo was arrested and taken to the police station. According to his confession, the main operation was located at a certain number in Fuxing Lane, Route Doumer, and was run by a Korean, along with Chinese gangsters, "Crippled Mother's Brother" and "Big Sister Bao," who were responsible for transporting the drugs. The police station then raided the address but found no one, as they had already fled after hearing the news.</p>
<p>Robbers Steal Vehicle</p>
<p>At around 8:50 a.m. yesterday, a No. 17277 luggage van belonging to the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company's Zhaofeng Park branch was dispatched to near Xingxin, Avenue Haig. Suddenly, two robbers appeared and ordered the driver to stop at gunpoint. They forced the driver out of the vehicle and drove off. The vehicle was found an hour later on Anhe Temple Road.</p>
<p>Embezzling Customer Accounts</p>
<p>Fang Junpu, a 22-year-old accountant from Suzhou at the Daxing Transportation Company at No. 14 Zhoushan Road, colluded with Yin Yongshun (21 years old), a Jiangbei employee who had already been dismissed, to collect 4,314 yuan in customer payments from various southern goods stores, which he lost at the Songyuan gambling den at No. 626 Avenue Haig. He was detained by the store owner, and Fang was arrested and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, charged with embezzlement. Both defendants admitted that they were confused at the time and did not deny secretly collecting customer payments for personal use. They appointed lawyers Wang Heng and Gu to defend them. After Judge Liao interrogated them, the court decided to postpone the hearing to the 20th. Both defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>Convicted of Opium Offenses</p>
<p>Shi Zhijian, a man from Suzhou, was found to be operating an opium den at No. 33, Lane 147, Xinzha Road, with the intention of profiting. The Anti-Narcotics Department of the Central Police Station learned of this and sent detectives to arrest Shi yesterday afternoon, seizing a large number of opium pipes, smoking paraphernalia, and account books. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Chuan Lin presided over the hearing. Shi Zhijian was convicted of aiding and abetting the setting up of a place for others to smoke prohibited substances with the intention of profiting and was sentenced to one year of imprisonment. The opium and other items were confiscated and destroyed.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon, Zhang Qisui, a tailor from Ningbo, residing at No. 109, Xiyongyuan Lane, Jing'an Temple, due to difficulties making a living, petitioned the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court to dispose of his 11-year-old child, Zhang Gendi (also known as Songqing). Also, a boy named Wang Didi, five years old, was abandoned by his parents on the street and was taken to the Second Special District Court by the patrol police to request disposal. After Judge Yuan Xiaogen briefly questioned them, he ordered that both children be handed over to the China Children's Welfare Association for care.</p>
<p>Beware of Pickpockets</p>
<p>To Whom It May Concern, on the 10th of this month, I was riding the French Business Route 22 bus when my leather bag was stolen, containing a directory of friends and relatives and several of my business cards. In addition to reporting to the police, I also published an urgent announcement in your newspaper on the 12th.

I hope passengers will be careful. To the Editor of Shen Bao, Su Zhi, July 13th.</p>

<h3>New Transcriptions from Old Newspapers 67 Years Ago (444) (See this newspaper from the 12th Year of Tongzhi in the Late Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Swimming</p>
<p>Zichan said, "Water is gentle, and people play with it, so many die." This is just a metaphor, but the truth is not beyond this. As the saying goes, "Water and fire are merciless." Water and fire are not mentioned separately at first because everyone knows that fire can kill people, but some people may not know that water can kill people. In fact, water is even more merciless than fire. One can escape from a fire, but when a flood occurs, there is no way to escape, and people are not afraid, which is very ridiculous. Recently, I have read in newspapers that many people have died from swimming, so I want to call out and wake people up. Even sages are not exempt from bathing and singing on the Yi River. At this time of intense heat, it is certainly pedantic to insist that everyone should adhere to the advice of concealing oneself from the heat and not wearing clothes that block the heat. However, there are methods for bathing in water. Those who have died from swimming in the news all took their own deaths; it is not that water can necessarily kill people. Those who are good at swimming always want to show off their skills. When they first enter the water, they rely on a burst of courage and can easily float and sink. The onlookers on the shore applaud, so they exert more effort to win the praise of the viewers, not considering that their strength is already exhausted. They still want to support themselves, but they do not know that when the vital energy is weak and their strength is thin, the force of the water becomes greater, leading to a risk to their lives. Some say that there are ghosts taking their place, so they die, but that is not true.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand in Balance</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listing. In the informal market for British and American exchange rates, supply and demand were balanced, with small fluctuations. The market was unremarkable. At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate rose by as much as five points. After opening until closing, the British exchange rate was tight, and the American exchange rate was loose. Transactions were mainly in American exchange rates. Initially, Chinese banks and speculators were selling, but these were absorbed by foreign firms. Later, foreign firms settled their accounts, and it seemed that funds were slightly insufficient. It was also rumored that a Japanese bank exchanged about 200,000 yuan in British gold (difficult to verify). Therefore, the July American exchange rate was slightly weak at 0.03125. At the close, British gold was 3 shillings 8.90625 pence, and the American exchange rate was 6 yuan. Compared to the previous day, British was tighter by 0.01565, and American was stronger by 0.0625. The futures trend was the same.</p>
<p>British and American Exchange Rates Rise by Five Points</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London exchange rate was down 0.0625 for spot and 0.125 for forward. The New York silver price was still flat, and the London gold price was stable. The exchange rate was unchanged for British against American, up 0.03125 against Shanghai, and there was no market against French. American rose by five points against British, down by a small amount against Shanghai, and there was no market against French. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. At the morning opening, the banks' spot selling price was 3 shillings 8.875 pence for British gold and 6 yuan for American exchange rate. Compared with the previous day's late close, British was tighter by 0.03125, and American was stronger by 0.0625, due to the exchange rate rebound. After opening, Chinese banks came to sell first, and the market was quiet but firm. Initially, Chinese banks sold spot American exchange rate to foreign firms at 6 yuan, then a foreign firm, Liu, did spot American exchange rate at 6.03125 yuan. The HSBC listing was unchanged. The silver balancing tax was reduced by 0.25%. Soon, speculators also came to sell, but Chinese and American banks had the appetite to absorb them, and there was little impact. It was calculated that the main local banks and American banks, as well as speculators, did the American exchange rate at 6 yuan. Later, foreign firms started to settle current American exchange rate and this month's futures, so traders slightly exceeded sellers, and the market slightly softened. However, the foreign firms continued to absorb spot American exchange rate from foreign firms at 6 yuan. The local banks' American exchange rate had softened to 5.96875 yuan. The closing situation was similar. British gold was 3 shillings 8.90625 pence, and the American exchange rate was 6 yuan. This month, British gold was the same price as spot, and the American exchange rate was 5.96875 yuan. July British gold was 3 shillings 8.84375 pence, and the American exchange rate was 5.90625 yuan. Compared to the previous night's close, spot British was softer by 0.015625, and American was stronger by 0.0625. July British gold also decreased by 0.015625, while American increased by 0.03125. August British was tighter by 0.03125, and American was loose by 0.03125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>

<p>Tianjin British and American Both Loosen</p>
<p>Tianjin, 13th (Saturday) - This morning's exchange market opened loose. British and American exchange rate spots each loosened by 0.0625. British exchange rate was 3 shillings 8.8625 pence, and American exchange rate was 5.5625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate was unchanged, still at 108 yuan. "Joint Currency" informal market was cheaper by half a yuan, at 14.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Little Enthusiasm in Bull or Bear Market, Gold Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold informal market was lackluster. Fluctuations narrowed, and the trend was stagnant. Operators were cautious in observation, and trading interest was not strong. The opening price was 5,380 yuan. Later, the bank boss came to sell, and the price fell by another 40 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate was firmer, but soon the exchange market rebounded slightly, and buying interest increased. Gold firms and securities firms bought more, raising the price to 5,420 yuan. Later, money changers sold as the price rose, and the price re-entered the 5,400 yuan mark. The closing price was 5,410 yuan, only 5 yuan lower than the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday. About one thousand and several hundred taels were traded in half a day. Jewelry gold first fell and then returned to flat. Customs gold was stagnant.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Squeezed Down by Five Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, with the exchange rate firm and the American exchange rate loose, the market was weak at the opening. The price was immediately pushed down by 35 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a bank at 5,380 yuan. Later, as banks and gold firms competed to sell, the price fell by another 40 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a bank, dropping to 5,340 yuan. Soon, as the exchange rate firmed, buying interest was stimulated. Securities firms and a certain gold firm bought a lot, and the price soon rebounded by 80 yuan. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a bank, raising the price to 5,420 yuan. After this, the exchange market loosened again. Money changers and retail investors sold, pushing the price down by another 40 yuan. A securities firm sold 30 taels to a gold firm, pulling the price back to 5,380 yuan. At noon, because the market sentiment was still good, gold firms and banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the price rebounded by another 30 yuan. A gold firm sold 10 taels to a bank, making the noon closing price 5,410 yuan. As a result, the price was squeezed down by 5 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 80 yuan in half a day. The selling price of spot gold by cash gold firms was a dozen yuan higher than spot, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower. The spot price was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold First Down Then Flat</p>
<p>At the beginning of the day, the selling price of jewelry gold by Dahangxing remained at 560 yuan per tael. At 9:40, it was reduced by 10 yuan, and at 10:45, it rebounded by 10 yuan. After that, it did not change. As a result, Dahangxing remained at 560 yuan. The new bank had the same price as the old price, and the buying price was about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Narrow Fluctuations in American Dollar Notes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw spot gold rise and fall, eventually falling slightly. Supply and demand for British and American gold pounds were fairly even, and market prices tended to be stable. British gold notes also changed little. American dollar notes fluctuated, but the range was very narrow, and eventually rose slightly by 7 cents. Hong Kong notes were in slightly higher demand, and the market price rose slightly by 2 cents. Japanese gold notes were in high demand, and the evening market rose to 1.21 yuan, up 1.5 cents from the previous day. Korean notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price was stable, remaining at 98 cents in the evening market.</p>
<h3>Sharp Decline in Discount Rate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts and notes saw a sharp decline. For every thousand yuan, the discount rate fell to 55 yuan in the morning and was 57 yuan for selling. In the afternoon, it decreased to 54 yuan, with the discount rate falling to only 52 yuan, a sharp drop of 7 yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association's interbank lending rate did not change, remaining at 20 cents for both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Both Down Slightly</h3>
<p>London, 12th - The price of silver fell 0.0625 for spot and 0.125 for forward. Speculators sold, with small transactions, the market was flat. The market recovered at the close and remained flat. Also, New York reported that the American silver price remained unchanged for spot. Bombay reported that both current and futures Indian silver prices fell by four annas. The market was flat, with a total of 125 transactions.</p>
<h3>Abundant Grain, Rice Price Stable, Another 8,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive</h3>
<p>After the foreign rice market fell sharply again the day before yesterday, yesterday morning's opening was able to attract local store activity to take advantage of the cheap prices. At that time, the situation was particularly bleak, and hawking sounds followed. Prices of all kinds of foreign rice once increased by about one yuan compared to the previous closing price. For example, No. 1 Chen Saigon was sold for 61.2 yuan, 61 yuan, No. 2 was 58 yuan, and Huowen was 60 yuan. However, after a long period of fatigue, confidence was not strong, and prices stopped rising as soon as they increased. As a result, the market changed again and turned soft. Thus, prices fell steadily until the close, without raising its head. The closing prices all returned to the original levels, with little profit or loss. No. 1 Chen Saigon remained at 60 yuan 5 cents and 60 yuan, and No. 2 was 57.5 yuan, 57 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice futures fell slightly by 3-4 cents, with little trading. The returned goods only did 75 tons of Siam No. 2 rice loaded on June 20 at a price of 68.8 to 5 cents, and 100 tons loaded on June 26 at a price of 67.7 to 8.5 yuan. The price of Saigon No. 2 rice loaded on the 11th of this month was 66 yuan. It is said that a group is also finalizing an order for 6,000 tons of rice.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Hai Ri ship arrived in Shanghai on the evening of the day before yesterday, carrying 7,905 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the company's wharf in Pudong. Unloading began yesterday morning. (Ancestral)</p>
<p>The distribution of glutinous rice is still not widespread, but since the goods are scarce, the owners are no longer willing to release them easily, so the situation is stable. The opening price and the previous closing price for Jin Li Baiyuan remained at 65 yuan, Changdan goods were 63-4 yuan, and Hong Kong Baiyuan was 65 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply of thick and thin japonica rice was only 600-700 bags. Outside the market, rumors spread that the owners were persistent due to the rebound in the foreign rice early market, and shouting prices were high. However, the subsequent market shifted, and the wish was not granted. As a result, all were said to be at a fixed price, with no changes. Changbang special grade japonica was 70 yuan, Su Kun Changzhou japonica was 67-8 yuan, Juezhi Su was 64-5 yuan, Qing Si thin rice was 68-9 yuan, and Nangang early rice was 65-6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Financial Review - Ending July 13th -</h3>
<p>— Saint Kerry Qiong</p>
<p>The Inflation of Japanese Currency</p>
<p>Based on the figures at the end of June, the amount of Japanese currency is approximately 600 billion yuan, with nine zeros at the end. Starting with the issuance of Japanese banknotes, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Bank of Japan's issuance increased by 50 billion yuan annually in 1937-1939. The increase in 1939-1940 was approximately 100 billion yuan, showing a sharp upward trend. Looking at the combined figures of the Bank of Japan, the Bank of Korea, and the Bank of Taiwan, the annual increase was 60 billion yuan in 1937-1939, and approximately 120 billion yuan in 1939-1940. If 1937 is taken as 100, then 1938 is 130, 1939 is 160, and 1940 is 225. The account of the number of Japanese banknotes issued from June of last year to June of this year is no wonder that the Japanese financial circles regard it as a "red alarm." The issuance figures for the three banks at the end of June each year are attached (unit: million Japanese yen):</p>
<p>40th Year 39th Year 38th Year 37th Year</p>
<p>Bank of Japan 3,597 2,522 2,074 1,640</p>
<p>Bank of Korea 437 285 254 151</p>
<p>Bank of Taiwan 176 146 105 75</p>
<p>Total 4,211 2,954 2,433 1,867</p>
<p>The Japanese government has always been extremely secretive about the inflation of Bank of Japan banknotes. Whenever the amount of issuance exceeds the total of gold reserves and security reserves, it expands the amount of security reserves to compensate. However, even after the security reserves were repeatedly expanded from 50 billion yen to 220 billion yuan, the issuance still exceeded the limit. At the same time, the security reserves were government bonds. Government bonds and banknotes are essentially the same, and the wavering of banknote credit is an inevitable result.</p>
<p>Therefore, in addition to expanding the issuance of the banks in Korea and Taiwan, under the policy of using war to support war and developing the occupied areas, efforts are being made to inflate the yen group currency. At the same time, in order to avoid the inflation of the yen in the Central China area, military scrip is issued to replace it.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, although the total of the three Japanese banks was 421.1 billion yuan at the end of June this year, the total sum of Japanese currency far exceeds this number. Therefore, this number must be added to another 124.9 billion yuan of other Japanese currencies. An analysis is as follows:</p>
<p>The first to be mentioned is the "Central Bank of Manchuria." The number of issuances on June 25th this year was 63.4 billion yuan, and at the end of June it was 63 billion yuan. The former number increased by 16 million yuan compared to May, but increased by 246,113,000 yuan compared to June of last year. The next is the "United Reserve Bank," whose issuance at the end of June this year was 55.8 billion yuan, an increase of 10 billion yuan compared to the end of last year. Even more, the "Mengjiang Bank" had 6.1 billion yuan at the end of June this year, an increase of 6 million yuan compared to the end of last year and an increase of 28 million yuan compared to the end of June last year. The extent of this inflation is truly frighteningly rapid.</p>
<p>The total of these six banks is 546 billion yuan, but this is not the accurate amount of Japanese currency. We will add 40 million yuan obtained from the reorganization of old banknotes in April 1939, and 70 million Japanese banknotes released in May of the same year due to the expansion of the security reserve limit of the Korean and Taiwanese banks (these Japanese banknotes were used as the issuance reserve of the Korean and Taiwanese banks), and 260 million yuan in small denomination banknotes (figures from the end of May this year), plus an estimated 200 million yuan in military scrip used in Central and Southern China (some estimates are 100 million yuan). The total of these four numbers is 570 million yuan. In this way, the total sum of Japanese currency is 6,010,000,000 yuan, truly an enormous figure.</p>
<p>Forcibly Elevating the Value of "Lianchao" (United Currency)</p>
<p>The "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, which are used by the Japanese in North China as a tool for manipulation, have an artificial value far below that of the Shanghai legal tender due to the excessive issuance. However, "Lianchao" is linked to the Japanese yen at par, which affects the value of the Japanese yen, causing it to fall as well. The Japanese have devised various methods to maintain "Lianchao," but in the case of excessive inflation, its value is still much lower. The vast North China still trusts the legal tender as the legal currency. In the past, the British concession in Tianjin did not recognize the power of "Lianchao" as a legal currency. However, after the currency agreement in the Tianjin Concession Agreement on June 19th, "The British Engineering Bureau shall not hinder the banknotes of the United Reserve Bank in any way," the work to increase the value of "Lianchao" followed. First, on June 26th, the control of import trade in North China was strengthened. Then, on July 10th, restrictions were implemented on loans from the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Korea in North China. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>The content of strengthening import control: (1) For goods ordered from regions other than Japan and Manchuria (such as third countries and Central and Southern China) and supplied with foreign exchange by "Lianchao," it is necessary to obtain a "Letter of Approval for Orders" issued by "Lianchao" in advance. However, the import of six kinds of grains—wheat, flour, rice, millet, sorghum, and corn—does not need to go through the above approval for the time being. (2) For goods imported from Japan, Manchuria, third countries, and Central and Southern China that do not require foreign exchange from "Lianchao," it is necessary to obtain a "Permit for Import Without Exchange" issued by the Customs Superintendent in advance. Otherwise, they shall not be declared for import. According to the import control in North China, it was implemented after March 2, 1939. It is usually stipulated that there are 42 categories of imported goods. On July 6 of last year, it was increased to 95 categories, that is, 10% of the foreign exchange earned by "Lianchao" from exports is deducted as the balance for normal remittances for distribution. However, due to the concessions, it was impossible to control imports for which "Lianchao" did not supply foreign exchange and imports that were cleared with legal tender. Now that the concessions are under Japanese control, the areas that have not yet been controlled are urgently being controlled.</p>
<p>After this method is implemented, imports will not be allowed without a "Letter of Approval for Orders" or a "Permit for Import Without Exchange." The exports from third countries and Central and Southern China to North China will naturally be prohibited. As a result, the need for legal tender in North China can be reduced, and the amount of legal tender bought with Lianchao can be reduced, in order to gradually eliminate the link between the value of Lianchao and the survival of legal tender, and to seek the independence and strengthening of the value of Lianchao.</p>
<p>However, "Lianchao" had already been issued to 558,000,000 yuan by the end of June. How can its value not fall with such inflation? It is not easy to achieve results by relying solely on strengthening import control. Therefore, the Japanese authorities again prohibited and restricted loans from the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Korea starting from July 10th, stipulating that equipment fund loans of less than 500,000 yuan must be approved by the Japanese Finance Officer stationed in Beijing, and loans above this amount must be approved by the Ministry of Finance. Loans of less than 50,000 yuan must be reported to the Finance Officer. For loans other than equipment funds, those between 100,000 and 500,000 yuan must be approved by the Finance Officer, and those over 500,000 yuan must be approved by the Ministry of Finance. Those between 50,000 and 100,000 yuan must be reported to the Finance Officer. Restricting loans means prohibiting the inflow of "Lianchao" into the market, in order to prevent the value from falling due to inflation.</p>
<p>Recently, the value of "Lianchao" has increased from 100.5 on June 19th to 94.00 on the 22nd, but later it fell to 99.00, and on July 5th it rose again to around 90 yuan. This week it has fallen again to around 94 yuan. The above figures are the number of "Lianchao" for 100 yuan of legal tender in North China. It can be seen that its value fluctuates very sharply. Although the future is unpredictable, judging from its issuance, since the establishment of the "United Reserve Bank" in 1938, the "Lianchao" has increased by approximately 100 million yuan every six months. If the issuance continues this trajectory in the future, its value will probably not be able to increase or be maintained. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Flour Market Gradually Falls into People's Hands</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw another decline in Japanese factory flour. The opening prices were 15 yuan and 3 jiao for the Phoenix brand in July, 15 yuan, 4 jiao, and 5 fen for August, and 15 yuan and 7 jiao for September, a small drop of 1 jiao and 2 jiao and 3 fen compared to before. This began to attract inquiries from local and regional merchants. 6,000 bags were traded. Other domestic miscellaneous brand flours were also dragged down by 1 jiao or 2 jiao, but there were no whole batches opened. On the Chinese factory side, only Fufeng supplied around 4,000 bags of Lao Jun brand flour to the local noodle and pancake industries, maintaining the original price of 15 yuan and 2 jiao. It is heard that merchants in Zhejiang and Ningbo are gradually purchasing foreign flour, and with the sharp fall in rice prices, the market seems to be showing signs of loosening.</p>
<p>Wheat: As it is the weekend period, the trading of new wheat is even more quiet. However, at present, the sources from land and water are constantly arriving, and the goods waiting to be sold in the warehouses in Hongkou are gradually becoming abundant. It is heard that the price paid by the Japanese factories for the goods they receive has dropped by another 4 or 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt is Dull</h3>
<p>The unofficial securities market is becoming increasingly quiet. Throughout the day, only four market quotations were made for the five types of public bonds. The situation is unprecedentedly dull and lifeless. In addition, due to the weekend, trading is even more sluggish. However, the original trading volume of each firm is not small. Everyone is waiting to see the changes in the environment. Without the stimulation of new news, this kind of depressing situation will not be easy to break. Yesterday, the trading volume in both the morning and afternoon markets was extremely low. Only Wuyuan and Xinfuhao slightly bought in, and scattered individual investors slightly sold out. The market prices in the morning and afternoon were completely equal. Except for Type D, which did not open throughout the day, each of the other types only had one market quotation. The total transaction volume is estimated to be no more than 200,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 100 shares of Xinxin Company stock were traded at a price of 10 yuan, 0 jiao, and 2.5 fen.</p>
<p>London, July 12 (Friday): The listed prices of Far Eastern British companies' stocks remained stable today. Only the London-registered shares of HSBC Bank continued to fall by one pound, at a price of 63 pounds. The Hong Kong-registered shares remained unchanged, and the rest also did not fall.</p>
<p>London, July 12 (Friday): The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts remained stable today. There were no changes in the upper and lower grade bonds.</p>
<p>The Rubber Estate Company, Limited, managed by the British firm Huitong Yanghang, will pay an interim dividend for the year 1940 on August 6th, at a rate of one yuan and five jiao per share in national currency.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Mill Purchases Gradually Moving</h3>
<p>The spot cotton trading is slightly more active, because the purchases of the Xinyu factory are relatively strong, and no other actions have been seen, so the market price is flat. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Dazhongji 205.00 209.00 Chengfu purchased 210 bales</p>
<p>Yamla 185.0012 One purchased 160 bales</p>
<p>Not recorded on the previous day</p>
<p>Changyinsha Packed 188.00 Xinyu purchased 168 bales</p>
<p>Xiasha American Type 205.25 Another 600 bales</p>
<p>Tongzhou Fine Velvet 209.00 Chengfu purchased 150 bales</p>
<p>Another dispatch: The market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was unusually quiet yesterday, and the video head did not continue. Later, due to the selling of the South and the closing of some bulls, the closing price fell by 23 pounds compared to the previous day. The Indian market situation is firm, and yesterday, including forecasts, it rose by another 34 rupees.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been continuously lively recently, especially by Japanese manufacturers and colleagues. Although Chinese factories are quieter, they also have a considerable intention to purchase. The general opinion is that the cotton market in the future will gradually move towards a better situation.</p>
<h3>20-Count Double Horse Yarn Hovers Around 1,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market has once again entered a hovering path. This is because the Yue merchants, who have been actively purchasing for several days, seem to be satisfied and are temporarily resting. As a result, people's hearts have calmed down slightly, and the market has loosened. However, the majority of colleagues still tend to be buyers, so the price has a strong hovering force.</p>
<p>The opening market atmosphere for spot yarn this morning has turned peaceful. The psychology of the majority in the market is that the opening price is high and tends to be on the selling side. As a result, the market opened slightly lower. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,010 yuan. Once this price was opened, sellers were still active. The general upper-day hedging parties all made hat tricks by first selling and then buying in. As a result, the market loosened and fell straight to 995 yuan. At this time, a certain person who sold out the previous day watched and did not move, and even pulled in when the price was low. The market price rebounded to 1,014 yuan. Later, the sales to customers were not smooth, and it was relatively sluggish, and it took another small step. The closing price was 1,010 yuan. The statistics of transactions in half a day totaled 1,555. The price of Double Horse fell by 3 yuan. Today, there are 8 pieces of cotton yarn, 50 pieces transported to Ningbo, 24 pieces transported to Luoluo, 405 pieces transported to Hong Kong, and 320 pieces transported to Yantai. The amount bought by each gangkou is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Colleagues 1.025 Hong Kong 26 Yunnan 200 Ningbo 70 Total 1.555</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Transactions are Scarce</h3>
<p>The momentum of the cloth market has weakened slightly. This is because the continuous sharp rise has caused some floating hoarding to sell off for profit, and the factory's opening of goods has also loosened slightly. The selling price has fallen slightly, with white goods (coarse and fine) down 2.5 to 5 jiao per piece. The price of bleached and dyed cloth is mostly unchanged. New transactions among hoarders have suddenly faded. Spot sales from the Zhejiang and Wen Yong gangs are still smooth. Several hundred pieces of colored cloth, dyed materials, and coarse cloth were purchased. More than 100 pieces of heavy coarse cloth and serge were purchased by the Yantai gang. More than 300 pieces of white goods and bleached and dyed cloth were traded in this street. More than 100 pieces of coarse twill, fine twill, and colored cloth were purchased by the Yuegang gang.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the factory announced that for Longtou fine cloth of Dongbu, for the warehouse orders issued before May (excluding June orders), if they have not been cleared from August onwards, warehouse rent will be increased, charging 10 yuan per piece. Therefore, those in the industry who hold warehouse orders before May urgently want to sell them off and exchange them for new orders. The market price was therefore suppressed. The morning closing price was 30 yuan, 0 jiao, and 1.5 fen. In the afternoon, there was no market due to Saturday. Sijunzi serge was still sold for 8 jiao, 8 and 9 fen. The warehouse rent for middle-grade fine cloth and fine twill serge remained the same. The price of fine cloth fell by about 2.5 jiao per piece.</p>
<p>Exports of piece goods on the 14th: 155 pieces were transported to Yantai, 245 pieces were transported to Hong Kong, 160 pieces were transported to Siam, and 540 pieces were transported to Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Loosened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to see a slight drop due to the scarcity of incoming merchants. The guild’s marked prices for spot goods were 67 yuan, 7 jiao negative, small triangle, and 53 yuan, 1 jiao to 2 jiao for re-export goods that immediately hit warehouse receipts. 54 yuan to 53 yuan, 9 jiao, small three or four jiao were asked for goods delivered on the 22nd. Taikoo’s Car White B Mark, West Warehouse, was 78 yuan, and East Warehouse was 77 yuan and a half, with no change. Dutch red also rose by 3 jiao, to 58 yuan and 8 jiao. A Guang merchant of State Sugar opened with 40 boxes of Tiaoqing at a price of 47 yuan, but there were no other transactions.</p>
<h3>Five-Point Tin: Shortage and High Demand</h3>
<p>Since the deterioration of the situation in Hong Kong and Vietnam, the five-point tin market has tended to be strong. The reason is that the source is cut off, and the Shanghai market inventory feels quite short, so the holders are optimistic, and the market is increasing step by step. The current market price for 99.9% purity is about 1,450 yuan, which is 20 to 30 yuan higher than before. However, the trade is due to the sluggish business of the foil shops in Shaoxing and Ningbo, and they have been waiting and watching in Shanghai for a long time. They still have no intention to move. Only the general retail buyers in the street can cope with the current sluggish market situation. Wholesale trade is hardly worth mentioning.</p>
<h3>Wood Nail Market Loosens</h3>
<p>Since the heavy blow from the Nanyang Gang, the trading of wood nails from this factory has been in a slump, and the current market still has no improvement. The market price is declining every day, currently selling at 46 yuan, plus extra fees per barrel. Business is only with the construction gang and retail buyers.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Two Batches of Haikou Branches Arrive</h3>
<p>Two batches of new Haikou branch goods arrived the day before yesterday by the Yusheng Wheel, totaling more than 2,700 boxes, which is a large number. The market trend prevents softening, and the opening price may turn down. The big ones can start opening tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, it is said.</p>
<h3>Wool and Raincoat Cloth: English Goods are the Most Expensive</h3>
<p>Raincoat cloth, English-made Robellin and single-sided open water beauty, solid-color wool surface, etc., have not arrived in port. Only a few companies in the industry, such as Yikang and Changji, have some inventory, resulting in high and expensive goods, and most are unable to replenish them. Yesterday, single-sided open water beauty and Robellin were sold at 22 yuan net per yard for wholesale, and Dong goods double-sided yarn raincoat cloth was sold at 4 yuan, 8 and 9 jiao per yard for wholesale. There are few inventions and products from domestic raincoat cloth factories. At present, only China Raincoat and Raincloth Factory and China Aipi Xi Underwear Company, which are made of all-yarn woven with chemical liquid soaked into raincloth, are sold out, but only limited to the current sale of raincoats in stores to prevent other companies from imitating them.</p>

<h3>The picture on the right shows Joan of Arc of France encouraging morale and repelling the British army during the Hundred Years' War.</h3>
<h3>France Today</h3>
<p>The French Revolution of 1789 once shook the whole world, what a magnificent event. The three slogans of freedom, equality, and fraternity it advocated are still yearned for by people today. Unexpectedly, the democratic commemoration this year, 150 years later, is in such a miserable state. The well-trained army has been defeated by its age-old enemy, Germany, and the powerful navy, ranking second in Europe, has been tearfully seized a large part of it by the Allied countries a month ago. Even in politics, democracy has been abolished and dictatorship has been implemented. Could it be said that today's democratic commemoration is its last? Is this kind of change, perhaps, as declared by the new French dictator, General Pétain, an emergency measure that must be taken during the national crisis, to strive for a glorious peace, and to rebuild France independently?</p>
<p>All kinds of changes are like a big dream. Apart from expressing sympathy, there is nothing else to say. It's just that the beautiful rivers and mountains of mainland France, even if a part of them are being occupied by the German army, are still worth a visit.</p>
<p>France can largely be regarded as an agricultural country; in terms of its customs and local conditions, it is a very complex country, and the local scenery everywhere is very lovely. The east is called Burgundy, and flat mountains extend to the Rhine River basin. The area is mostly wheat fields and vineyards. The north is the Flanders Plain, which has been a place of military operations since ancient times, and the surviving trees are few and far between. The northwest is Normandy, a green field, rich in products, and the residents are brave and good at fighting. William the Conqueror, who conquered England in 1066, came from this area. The west is Brittany, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, with a rough dialect, and the residents still hold independent ideas. The southeast has the Alps, which extend for hundreds of miles and are covered with snow all year round. They are the source of the blue coastline of the Mediterranean and the rivers. The south is Provence, where olive trees and orange trees are found in abundance. In addition, there are also Basque, Gascony, and Auvergne. Although they are not easy to see on today's maps, the residents of each place still maintain their inherent characteristics. However, the history of French unification has transformed them all into French people, just as the United States of America has transformed various immigrants into Americans.</p>
<h3>New York World's Fair Chronicle E. L. (Continued from Previous Issue)</h3>
<p>General Overview of the Fairgrounds</p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the fairgrounds are broadly divided into two sections. The exhibition section can be further categorized into five major areas: Government, Lifestyle, Food, Transportation, and Production. The entertainment area features a variety of performances and can be divided into land and water sections.</p>
<p>The layout of the fairgrounds is roughly rectangular. The northern two-thirds of the area is dedicated to exhibitions, while the southern part is for entertainment. The buildings in the exhibition area are magnificent, showcasing either their function or national identity. The central structures in this section are a large "Sphere" and a towering "Obelisk," which are easily visible from the air. The "Sphere" represents internationalism, while the "Obelisk" symbolizes American independence and freedom. To the east of these central landmarks are the "International Lagoon" and "Peace Plaza"; to the west are the City Hall Plaza and the New York City Pavilion.</p>
<p>The entertainment area, known as the "Great White Way," is located east of "Liberty Lake," with numerous buildings along the shore. It is divided into sections for theater, music, sports, animal displays, and variety shows. At night, fireworks light up the sky, reflecting in the lake, creating a beautiful scene. This entertainment hub is a highlight of this year's fair and can be considered the world's largest amusement park.</p>
<p>Viewed from above, the fairgrounds resemble an open, colorful fan spread across a three-mile square area. In terms of function, it can be divided into an industrial exhibition zone, a government and foreign exhibition zone, and an entertainment zone. Between the "Sphere," "Obelisk," and "International Lagoon" lies the "Court of Peace." This "Court" is a vast space with avenues, pools, lawns, flowerbeds, and trees, featuring historical statues, including an eighty-five-foot-tall statue of Washington. From the "Court of Peace," pathways radiate in all directions, leading to various exhibition areas. The "International Lagoon" is most beautiful at night, with fireworks, colorful fountains, and electric rainbows all concentrated here, making it the dazzling central area of the "World's Fair."</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Exhibits</p>
<p>This World's Fair is not just a kaleidoscope but also a comprehensive collection of worldly knowledge and a record of human intelligence and folly. Visitors are not merely experiencing novelties and viewing curiosities but are also, unknowingly, gaining a wealth of knowledge. The exhibits are diverse and all-encompassing. Even with several days, one cannot fully appreciate everything on display. This is only a glimpse of one or two percent of what is available.</p>
<p>Production: This section can be said to be a compilation of novelties, with each exhibit organized by the producer. Given the current hot weather, we might focus on the climate control exhibits. There is a small glass house where machines measure the temperature of a person after they enter. There is also a large hall showcasing the achievements of air conditioning, demonstrating how air is conditioned to suit individual body temperatures in places like a mine 8,500 feet deep, a factory in the Arctic Ocean, or a telephone company in the tropics. Other exhibits in this section include photography, electricity, clocks, glass, hardware, petroleum, electricity, steel cables, and more.</p>
<p>Transportation: This includes exhibits on automobiles, rubber tires, trains, and airplanes. The displays by Chrysler and General Motors are particularly noteworthy. General Motors presents a scenario of highway transportation in 1960 (i.e., twenty years in the future), featuring as many as 16,000 small cars and freight vehicles. The railway plaza showcases the history of "iron horses" across ten acres and a half-mile of tracks. Twenty-seven major railway companies present exhibits, ranging from wood-burning trains to modern streamlined electric trains.</p>
<p>Entertainment: Americans love activity, sports, and entertainment. This "Great White Way" amusement park includes all the highlights of the entertainment world. Water entertainment, which was absent in 1939, is a new feature this year. A troupe of five hundred performers, including many beautiful women, performs music on the water, creating ethereal and delightful sounds. There is also a "hot and cold" show, with the first half featuring various women dancing energetically, and the second half featuring ice-skating women, creating a chilling contrast. Numerous other attractions are also on display.</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<p>Here are some interesting snippets about this year's fair:</p>
<p>When the fair opened last year, authorities hoped to attract at least sixty million visitors. However, the actual number of paying visitors was only 25,817,265, less than half the projection. This was considered a failure, hence the change in approach this year.</p>
<p>On the opening day this year, the attendance reached 188,100 by 9 p.m. A total of 1,385 New York police officers and detectives were deployed to maintain order in and around the fairgrounds.</p>
<p>The fair provides excellent dining options. There are no fewer than sixty restaurants, serving approximately 150,000 diners on the opening day. A variety of teas and meals are available at different price points to cater for all palates. Prices range from as little as two or three dimes to as much as two or three dollars. During the 1939 fair, a total of 12 million hot dog sandwiches were sold, truly a grand spectacle.</p>
<p>The construction cost of the three hundred buildings in the fairgrounds ranged between forty and fifty million US dollars. The construction work was almost equivalent to building a city that could house 80,000 residents, and the construction period was only three years.</p>
<p>There are sixty movie theaters in the fairgrounds, showing over five hundred films daily, including silent, sound, and color films.</p>
<p>At least three thousand flags are displayed throughout the fairgrounds, representing seventy-one countries, fifty-four states, and countless organizations and associations.</p>
<p>The underground water pipes, gas pipes, garbage pipes, and electrical conduits in the fairgrounds cost a total of US$12 million, which visitors cannot see.</p>
<p>Over two hundred tons of paint were used for building construction last year, and over one hundred tons of paint have already been used for renovations this spring.</p>
<p>The fair's main entrance can accommodate 160,000 people per hour.</p>
<p>The jewelry and diamond section in the "Lifestyle" exhibition area is worth millions of dollars. Two large boxes of uncut diamonds, worth US$1.5 million, are guarded by specially built guardhouses with armed police.</p>
<h3>Molotov and Ribbentrop (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— En</p>
<p>Ten months have passed since the signing of the German-Soviet Pact, which is considered a major issue in the European war. Will the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union become closer from now on, or will it suddenly turn into a break and war? The answer to this question largely depends on the actions of the officials who negotiated the pact, namely Molotov and Ribbentrop, two of the most active figures in Europe. Now, let's introduce a sketch of these two behind-the-scenes figures who brought Hitler and Stalin together, as described by New York Herald-Tribune's European correspondent, Parson.</p>
<p>Astute political observers are still somewhat confused as to whether Stalin is acting as Hitler's puppet, or whether the German leader has become a puppet of the mysterious Soviet leader.</p>
<p>On August 23, 1939, the two countries concluded a bizarre marriage, and at the time, it was considered unbelievable that the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party could combine. It would be an understatement to regard Molotov and Ribbentrop as merely guests at this wedding. Anyone familiar with the personalities of Molotov and Ribbentrop and the process of their career achievements would certainly not consider these two ambitious offensive diplomats to be merely echoing their masters. Instead, one must acknowledge that this elusive German-Soviet agreement was entirely orchestrated by them.</p>
<p>Molotov's appearance is similar to that of former US President Theodore Roosevelt. He has broad shoulders, a round head, and a thick neck, suggesting vitality. Below his high-bridged nose, he has a short mustache, and his passionate eyes peer through his pince-nez glasses. He exudes the aura of a boxer and a university professor. Every movement reveals strength and confidence. When he speaks, his intonation, when grasping the key points, has that high pitch, and his expression on stage is similar to that of Theodore Roosevelt, truly having the same effect through different means. However, Molotov has a stutter. Strangely, his stutter is related to his mood. Sometimes he can give speeches for hours without any stuttering. At other times, he stammers incoherently. But although his speech is not perfect, he has another kind of power that can attract listeners.</p>
<p>Molotov resembles Theodore Roosevelt not only in appearance. His temperament is imbued with the same indomitable human vitality as Theodore Roosevelt. Once he starts a task, no opposing force can</p>
<p>Molotov, the Soviet Foreign Minister, stop him. If someone tries to argue with even a small part of his plan, he will exhaust himself trying to convince that person. He deals with opponents in a sweeping manner.</p>
<p>However, Russians lack the distinct American personality. Molotov does not have Theodore Roosevelt's quick wit, nor his unique sense of humor. This communist leader has only one simple path in mind. Therefore, his thinking speed is slow. His colleagues know that Molotov's final decision on a matter is unwavering, because he has almost completely and carefully studied other solutions.</p>
<p>Molotov's original name was Vyacheslav Skryabin, and he was the son of a small merchant, born fifty years ago. "Molotov" means "hammer" in Russian, which was a pseudonym he used in his youth when engaging in revolutionary work at the grassroots level. The world-renowned music composer Alexander Skryabin was his uncle, who was a member of the Russian aristocracy, so Molotov's political enemies often attacked him for this kinship. In fact, apart from a hereditary love of music, Molotov never materially benefited from his uncle. His father was extremely poor and had to squeeze his own blood and sweat to nurture his son to obtain a higher education.</p>
<p>As a young man, Molotov was forced to struggle for a living due to hunger and cold. He was unwilling to accept his father's assistance. He was extremely intelligent and could have become a successful economics professor or, apart from his stutter, a lawyer. But he finally joined the revolutionary work, disregarding the danger, placing himself at the grassroots level, organizing communist cells in factories and even in the St. Petersburg Technological Institute where he studied.</p>
<p>At that time, Molotov was a pale-faced, thin young man. He wore tattered clothes, had messy hair, and did not wear glasses despite his nearsightedness. Like a group of radical young people, it seemed that their lives were destined to debate Marxism on the podium or in small restaurants.</p>
<p>He studied many books in prison, because he was arrested from time to time, and his university courses were intermittent. He worked as an editor for the secret communist newspaper Pravda, and Stalin was the editor-in-chief. During that period, he and Stalin became close friends, so it was the "Man of Steel" who promoted this "Hammer" to become a leader. When Molotov was twenty-six years old, he was exiled by the Russian Emperor to Siberia, but he escaped a few months later.</p>
<p>The following year, 1917, was the height of the Russian Revolution, and Molotov became one of the Communist Party's most capable leaders. Although he suffered from imprisonment, poverty, and hunger, his mind and body were not damaged. Strangely, it made his body stronger. His broad shoulders and fearless and realistic approach to various issues made him stand out among his colleagues. Molotov and Trotsky eventually felt difficult to get along with each other. Trotsky often said that he was a person "without hope and without creativity."</p>
<p>After Lenin returned to Russia, Molotov relinquished his nominal leadership to him. But in less than two years, he distinguished himself again, took a position of importance, and became a rising star among Soviet economists.</p>
<p>In 1927, he pushed forward the collective farm system regardless of everything. This task was very difficult at the beginning, and the forces of counter-revolution came fiercely. Therefore, several communist leaders advised to temporarily abandon this plan. Even Stalin was afraid to act for a while, feeling that millions of powerful peasants were determined to protect their land, and the force of opposition to socialism was not to be insulted. Molotov, however, unleashed his "Hammer" and violently attacked the opposition, and as a result, the largest peasant revolution in human history was completed.</p>
<p>When other communist leaders were afraid of Stalin's likes and dislikes and became indifferent to everything, Molotov continued to be active and did not care about personal honor or disgrace. In 1930, when he was elected Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, he did not regard the chairmanship as an empty title, but strongly urged other members to carry out the duties of the prime minister, and he was particularly disgusted with bribery and dereliction of duty. His colleagues thought he was even more terrible than Stalin.</p>
<p>In 1935, when Stalin was carrying out a large-scale purge of the so-called Trotzkyists for "overthrowing" the government and forming secret alliances with the German military authorities, Molotov suggested conducting peace negotiations with Hitler at the seventh session of the Soviet Union. In his speech, sensitive ears could already hear that he had already made up his mind to lean towards signing the German-Soviet Pact. The chairman of the People's Committee demanded that Hitler withdraw all the threats against the Soviet Union in his book "Mein Kampf," thereby building a road to peace between Germany and the Soviet Union. Although Stalin had already decided internally to purge several important members of the party who were inclined to ally with Germany, he saw that his own senior officials publicly advocated reconciliation with Germany. After listening to Molotov's grand speech, Stalin, strangely enough, accepted it all.</p>
<p>Molotov only walks one path and speaks only one kind of language. He is a realistic thinker. Ribbentrop is witty and elegant, speaks several languages, and adapts to circumstances. These two are absolutely opposite, and such a contrast is nowhere to be found. One is a diplomat with a big fist and thick arms, while the other has the style of wearing velvet gloves. Russians are crude and uncultured, lack flexibility, do not beat around the bush, and do not care about social niceties. Germans often smile, are good at flattery, have a talent for sarcasm, and before grasping the key point, they are willing to go around in circles and discuss in many ways. The differences between the two are so great, but the similarities between the two are also strange. Both have deviated from the usual path of diplomats, are very stubborn in their own beliefs, and are not easily shaken.</p>

<h3>Jesus is the Savior of the Sick</h3>
<p>Illness is the most painful thing in life, and its losses are indescribable. Throughout history, scholars have tried various methods to heal, and there have been many such people. Unfortunately, they can only treat the symptoms and not the root cause. When Jesus was in the world, the masses recognized Him as an unprecedented divine physician. Even in today's era of scientific advancement, there are incurable diseases for which no effective medical techniques have been invented that can compare to Jesus. At that time, there were all kinds of sick people who were healed by Jesus' touch. He cleansed lepers, made the blind see, made the lame walk, healed a woman who had been bleeding for twelve years, made an old woman who had been hunchbacked for eighteen years stand upright, and made a paralytic who had been paralyzed for thirty-eight years get up and run. The facts are detailed in the Bible and are by no means fabricated. More than seven hundred years before Jesus was born, a prophet had already predicted, "He took up our infirmities and bore our diseases." Jesus came to save people, manifested the great love of God in the world, and practiced medicine with love, truly being the savior of all those who suffer from pain and illness. Currently, there are more than 230 large and small hospitals established by Chinese churches, serving millions of patients every year. Remembering the source of the water we drink, we are grateful for Jesus' gifts. Jesus can not only heal various physical ailments but also heal spiritual illnesses. Physical illnesses are inherently painful, but spiritual illnesses are even more painful. What exactly are spiritual illnesses? They are sins. As the Bible says, all unrighteous things are evil, greed, malice, envy, murder, strife, deceit, hatred, sexual immorality, and other sins that arise from within, the harm of which is enough to steal the body and mind, destroy ambition, deprive life of happiness, and disrupt social peace. Jesus came into the world with the purpose of saving us and fighting against demons who harm the body and mind. He once said, "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." World-renowned doctors can only treat people's false illnesses, treating the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. They can only treat the symptoms and not the root cause. Only Jesus can cure all incurable diseases of the body and mind. Friends, if you are willing to sincerely believe, repent, and change your ways, listen to His commands, and hate evil as an enemy, He will surely give you peace, heal all your diseases, and give you the ability to be born again, filling your heart with spiritual joy and giving you physical and mental health and a more abundant life. Sick compatriots, rise up quickly! Only Jesus is your savior.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Essay Submission Stamp</h3>
<p>Let me explain the meaning of the stamp:</p>
<p>Essay Submission Stamp</p>
<p>The pattern in the center, "申" is the ancient form of the character Shen, and the bell shape is a wooden clapper.</p>
<p>Shen Bao has the important responsibility of promoting education and spreading culture, so it adopts the meaning of the sentence "Heaven will take the master as a wooden clapper" and uses the wooden clapper to symbolize the important mission undertaken by Shen Bao!</p>
<p>This time it is used as a stamp for essay submission. You should paste a copy of the stamp on your submissions, otherwise the submission will be considered invalid regardless of the content. Please pay attention!</p>
<h3>Composition Topic Guidance</h3>
<p>My Father: There are several aspects that can be written about in this topic: the father's occupation, the father's spare time, the father's personality, the father's scholarship, the father's business life, and the father's method of educating children. It must be about your father, not someone else's father. If you write a few points, make sure to determine the order in advance. The worst thing is to write a sentence or two for each point, turning it into an account with no highlights.</p>
<p>My Favorite Book: Of course, you have more than one book that you love to read, so make sure to clarify the word "favorite." Your favorite book must be one that you have already read. Summarize the main points of the book and attach your own thoughts, or raise questions, or elaborate, or supplement. Do not arbitrarily excerpt or even copy a paragraph. If you have not yet fully understood the book and cannot summarize the main points, then you should carefully and quietly read it again. When writing the essay, it is best to put the book aside to avoid being restricted by the book.</p>
<h3>Children's Jokes</h3>
<p>Hu Shibiao</p>
<p>Nose Didn't Fall Asleep</p>
<p>Mother said to Atang: "Go quietly to the hallway and see if Grandpa has fallen asleep."</p>

<p>Indestructible Matter</p>
<p>The teacher taught a very young child arithmetic and said, "If you have ten chestnuts in your hand and eat four, how many are left?"</p>
<p>"Ten."</p>
<p>"Why?" the teacher asked anxiously.</p>
<p>"Six in my hand and four in my belly, isn't that ten?"</p>
<h3>Bug and Bullet</h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>The weather these days is very hot, especially one or two hours after lunch. In the past, Yonger would lazily go to school for half a day, even if it was 100 degrees hot, he had to go to school. But today is a holiday, and the hot weather really made him give up any idea of going out. After eating lunch and taking a nap for about an hour, he quietly got up. He wanted to work on his holiday homework, but he couldn't muster any interest in it. His brother was probably also staying at home because of the hot weather. So Yonger and Zonger started chatting.</p>
<p>"Brother, how are the wars in Europe going these days?"</p>
<p>"Why don't you pay attention to it all the time? It's good to cultivate the habit of reading the newspaper. The wars in Europe are raging, the fire is burning to the sky, airplanes, tanks, artillery, warships... all fully show their 'colors,' and the people have tasted the same taste of fleeing as we have. The bombing of airplanes and the shooting of anti-aircraft guns are fighting, and we also have very deep impressions of these tragic scenes of war." He paused for a while, then continued, "Speaking of anti-aircraft guns and airplanes, I recall reading a book in which one section was very interesting. I'll tell you some of the general details that I can remember, I guarantee you'll laugh (To be continued)"</p>
<h3>How to Practice Calligraphy During Summer Vacation (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Shen Baiying</p>
<p>(1) When practicing small characters, you can copy difficult phrases and sentences from national language textbooks, or copy stories from newspapers and magazines. One practice yields two gains, killing two birds with one stone, which is excellent.</p>
<p>(2) When practicing medium or large characters, you can borrow a few calligraphy copybooks from the school and take turns using them.</p>
<p>(3) Other materials related to application can also be collected as much as possible during the summer vacation. They will definitely be useful in the future. For example, a hygiene notice: "Everyone knows the harm of flies. Now it is summer, and many are flying out. They lay eggs everywhere, and the number is considerable, spreading cholera, as fierce as tigers and leopards. Vomiting and diarrhea, life is hard to protect. Tell my citizens, everyone should understand; pay attention to closing the garbage can lid; it is best to eat less fishy and meaty foods; quickly discard all dirt and waste. Remember! Remember! Eliminate pests as early as possible!" Another example is a store leaflet: "Goods vary in height and quality, the quality of the goods should be carefully studied. Our store carefully selects all goods and dares to say that none can surpass us. We have a complete range of household daily necessities. The quality is different from others, the pricing is different from others. We absolutely do not mix fakes with genuine products, and we absolutely do not offer false discounts. It is currently a cheap period, and we are implementing drastic price cuts. New goods are piled up like mountains, and you can freely choose and buy. Please come and visit, everyone, and you will know that what I say is not false."</p>
<p>Some of you may ask, "Now that paper is expensive, what inexpensive things can be used?" According to my thoughts, there are two ways: one is to use old newspapers or broken books to write on; the other is to use a large square brick dipped in water to write on. In addition, there may be better methods, please tell me, I can't think of any more.</p>
<p>Finally, you also want to ask me in passing: "After writing well in school, you can ask the teacher to critique it. Which characters are written well, which are written poorly. Where are the poorly written ones wrong, and how should they be corrected next time. Every critique is a step forward. Now that summer vacation has started, and I am studying at home, who will critique me?" I think, as long as you practice diligently every day, critique is always a small matter. Here are a few ways you can use for reference:</p>
<p>The first way is to ask your parents, uncles, brothers, etc. to critique you.</p>
<p>The second way is to invite a few classmates to critique each other.</p>
<p>The third way is to critique yourself. After each practice, nail the results to the wall, take a few steps back, and look at them from a distance. If small characters can be written evenly and straight, it is a good result. If large characters can be written steadily, not looking like they are about to fall, it is also a good result. You can also put the previous results side by side. Comparing them will clearly show whether there has been any progress.</p>
<p>Without saying much, you want to ask how to practice calligraphy during summer vacation to make progress easily? My answer is: everything depends on you. Whoever is willing to work hard will surely reap good rewards in the future. Time passes quickly. A month or so of summer vacation will pass in the blink of an eye. Work hard, children! Goodbye! Goodbye!</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on the World's Only Circus School</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>There is only one vocational school in the world that specializes in training circus performers. It is located in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, USA. Here, I will briefly write about the situation of that circus school below:</p>
<p>Establishment Process This circus school was established in 1927. The founder, William Schultz, is an expert in the art of circus and is proficient in martial arts. For more than ten years, he has put a lot of effort into the operation of this circus school, which has resulted in today's achievements. In addition to him, most of the teachers who teach various courses are also circus experts who have performed in circus troupes in the past and have been in the limelight.</p>
<p>Numerous Courses The courses taught in the circus school are also very diverse. Regarding the circus department, there are martial arts, rope walking, upside-down walking, etc. Other general courses, such as reading, writing, and arithmetic, are also quite emphasized. In terms of curriculum, it is completely in accordance with ordinary vocational schools, so subjects such as typing, home economics, and mechanics are also taught at the same time.</p>
<p>Training Period Most of the students entering the circus school are young children. After five years of rigorous training, they can become amateur circus performers. After two years of advanced training, they can become professional circus performers and be able to join a circus troupe to perform. However, over the years, not many people have been able to complete the advanced courses, and most drop out halfway.</p>
<p>Public Performance The school holds a circus performance every two years, scheduled for six days, with the aim of publicizing and attracting outside attention to the circus school. During the performance season, people from all over will travel from afar, and the scene is unprecedented, because the general public has long admired the students' acting skills in the circus school, so when they hear that there is a public performance, most people want to see it first.</p>
<p>Easy Employment Graduates of this school have been hired by circus troupes and have performed all over the world. Actors from circus troupes in various countries often write to the circus school, requesting to enroll for further study, but the circus school generally refuses due to customs, because all students of the school are limited to children from Manitowoc, and students from other places have never been accepted, which only makes those who aspire to do so sigh outside the door.</p>
<h3>Embarrassing Situation at the Opera</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>I recall a certain amateur performer, playing a Jing role, singing "Qionglin Banquet" with a Mr. Lu, who played a Xusheng role. On that day, the play was the finale, and friends and colleagues supported the show enthusiastically. When the performance reached the scene of making a ruckus in the mansion, Mr. So-and-so, playing Ge Denyun, came on stage. After sitting down with Fan Zhongyu, it was customary for Ge Denyun to sing the "Taishi Mansion" segment of the Yuanban first. As soon as the Huqin prelude finished, Ge Denyun completely forgot the lyrics and could not sing them. At this point, the musician had no choice but to play the prelude again as a remedy. Unexpectedly, at this time, Fan Zhongyu, seeing that Ge Denyun had forgotten the lyrics, and in order to smooth things over, besides saying "Taishi, Sir," proceeded to directly sing "I was originally." At this moment, Ge Denyun, reminded by the phrase "Taishi, Sir," also sang "Taishi Mansion" at the same time. As a result, one Sheng and one Jing spoke at the same time, and the audience burst into an uproar. Then, Fan Zhongyu, seeing that Ge Denyun had already sung, no longer followed with "a poor scholar." Who knew that Ge Denyun also had this intention and no longer followed with "set up a banquet," and again did not make a sound at the same time, and the entire audience became even more restless. The two gentlemen, in this embarrassing situation, actually lifted their robes and fled into the backstage. Fortunately, the members of the troupe were alert and quickly brought another actor on stage to calm things down. This kind of situation in the theater is rare, but speaking and stopping singing at the same time, thinking carefully about the comical situation at the time, I am afraid that no one would not smile silently.</p>
<h3>Zhao Jingshen and Du Zimei Co-compile "The Light of Women"</h3>
<p>— Peng Hua</p>
<p>"The Light of Women" is a film adaptation of Ba Jin's trilogy "Family," "Spring," and "Autumn." This is a masterpiece in the Chinese literary world.</p>
<p>Most middle school and university students have read this novel, which shows that readers are fascinated by these three novels; at the same time, it can be seen how much readers love these three novels.</p>
<p>Before the war, the literary scholar Mr. Zhao Jingshen had long wanted to adapt it into a film script, intending to hand it over to Lianhua Film Company, starring Ms. Chen Yanyan. He had also obtained permission from the author, Ba Jin, but later, because they were busy with personnel matters, they were slow to start writing.</p>
<p>Now, he is using the summer vacation period and has already started writing with Mr. Du Zimei (according to Mr. Du, he is a student studying literature).</p>
<p>However, the plots of "Family," "Spring," and "Autumn" are very complicated. If the three are to be combined into one adaptation, wouldn't it be too long? This is a question worth considering.</p>
<p>This adaptation of "Family," "Spring," and "Autumn" is undoubtedly a blow to the current costume film "Folk Tales"! It can politely say to them: "You should step down"!</p>
<h3>Zhongyou Drama Troupe Public Performance</h3>
<p>Shi Huafu's spoken drama "Working Women" has been well received by all circles since it was performed by the Shanghai Drama and Art Society. Now this play will be performed again today at 9:30 am and 3:00 pm at the Lyceum Theatre. The performers are the "Zhongyou Drama Troupe", which is hosted by the drama group of the Shanghai Franco-Chinese Alumni Association. It was established last year, and this year is the first anniversary, so a experimental performance is held to commemorate it. It is said that the director is Jia Jichuan.</p>
<h3>Laurel and Hardy Forever Collaborate - An Agreement of Understanding Has Been Signed</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Laurel and Hardy, this number one comedic star duo on the screen; since their collaboration, they have indeed been highly praised by people all over the world. However, the news of their frequent breakups has been unsettling for the audiences who have always loved them. According to news from London, the occurrence of this matter is mostly due to the uneven script composition, and often in their films, Laurel occupies a more important position than Hardy.</p>
<p>Until recently, the two have cooperated again; and there is a trend of never breaking up again. It turns out that the two have reached an understanding and have also signed a legal-style contract. Although the contract does not stipulate a guarantee that the same shortcomings as before will not occur in their films in the future; but on the point of cooperation, a solid foundation has been laid; if either of the two is unwilling to cooperate, they will be subject to a large fine.</p>
<p>Following the changes of the times, the batches of red stars with brilliant light on the Hollywood screen today will eventually become silent one day. Taking this pair of comedic stars as an example, their acting skills will slowly diminish in the eyes of the audience. Therefore, in order to maintain their reputation in the future, in addition to the two of them should permanently cooperate, they also urgently need to improve their acting skills. The opinions of all circles are that they hope that their future films can have a large amount of self-created humorous lines.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Cases</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's End</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>Hawthorne paid more attention and said, "Argue? Did you hear anything?"</p>
<p>Old Mao said, "Of course I couldn't hear what that Mr. Yu said, but I heard a few words from Miss Wang." "What did she say?" "She said, 'Yes, there is such a thing.'... 'Are you fit to manage me?'... 'Do you have the guts!'... 'Bullshit!'... At that time, the uncle happened to come back in from outside, and persuaded Miss Wang not to get angry, and Miss Wang slammed the receiver down hard, and went upstairs angrily."</p>
<p>Hawthorne's eyes became more solemn, and he said to himself, "That person cannot be underestimated. ... Brother Jinshou, we need to find him to talk."</p>
<p>Before Ni Jinshou could express his opinion, Old Mao rushed to say, "There is more. That is, when he and Miss Wang were arguing in this living room that day, some of the words they said were also terrible to hear."</p>
<p>Hawthorne said, "What words?" Old Mao said, "He was arguing with Miss Wang and that Mr. Zhao here. Although I didn't hear it completely, their voices were very loud and the situation was terrible. Later, the uncle persuaded Mr. Yu to go out, and he kept scolding people on the way: 'Heartless and ungrateful thing!... Okay, I'll teach you a lesson!' Sir, think about it, he is clearly at odds with Miss Wang. Now that Miss Wang has been beaten to death like this, who else but him could have done it?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne lowered his head again, as if estimating whether Old Mao's views were likely to be established. Ni Jinshou then took over and asked.</p>
<p>"Are your words all true?"</p>
<p>Old Mao resolutely said, "Not half a lie."</p>
<p>"Then, why did Jinmei just say you were talking nonsense?" (44)</p>
