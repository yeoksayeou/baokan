<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本外交的窮途</h3>
<p>歷數今日日本的種種失敗。外交要算其中最顯著的一項。在戰爭中的這三年。日本外相更迭七八决。內閣因此而傾圯者亦達三數。在政策方面，幾乎所有的路綫和外交名詞都曾一一嘗試而絕鮮成功。其間唯一的重大收穫只是三國（現在應該是五國了！）同盟的締結。而日本國際地位不惟毫未增强，反而每况愈下。步入空前支絀的窘境。持與任何戰時國家相較。當　鮮有其匹，而在日本歷史當中，這也要算是空前的現象，近兩月中，近衛自一度發為對美挑釁談話而後，即迥避此項問題而絕口不談。而松岡的外務省，亦僅能以緩和美方反感安撫日人焦燥為能事、不僅所謂革新外交也者僅等於徒託空言。其就任之初所侃侃而談的抱負以至外交陣容調整均無事實上的表現。對美外交於今已近擱淺，野村吉三郞對於美使一職的興趣和勇氣似乎都還缺乏。而於三國締盟後即趕赴莫斯科的建川美决，經過月餘折衝。也連不侵協定的一紙文告尙無端倪。三國同盟使日本與英美間僅餘的一點友誼都宣告斷送。另一方面，德義本身固無助於日，甘替日本拉攏來的匈羅兩同盟國家還不僅止是條的上的與國？至於日本目前根本國策的「解決中國事變」與南進政策。松岡所負責任最大，而事實上，無論是和平攻勢。是經濟談判，都未能獲致預期效果。日政府最近召開的御前會議與樞密會議，也許於此更有新的決定，但料其亦無從根本改輕其重大困難。試看最近的松岡，沉穩持重，竟與馳騁日內瓦樽俎間尊循軍部意旨而退出國聯時判若兩人。這是他的轉變。同時也可見他的苦悶。</p>
<p>日本今日外交支絀若此，而在已往歷史上，並不是沒有過絢爛的一頁：甲午日俄兩役，日本都曾得力於外交上的良好運用，而英日同盟一舉更奠定了日本稱霸遠東的基礎。日俄戰後，日本與法俄先後締結協定，取得在亞洲大陸勢力範圍之諒解，第一决歐戰期中，復與英法密相結托，對美亦有蘭辛石井協定之締結，因得在中國和太平洋攫取若干重大權益，這小可吾認都是日本在外交上的勝利。而日本之由半殖民地位躍為一等强國，除却對外戰爭的勝利與經濟產業的發展而外，外交是一個重要關鍵，而且如果不是借重對外運用的成就，其對外作戰和產業發展都不免遭遇障碍，能否遽即臻於富强尙爲疑問。然而那個黃金時代是過去了；現在日本外交陳容也許不足與大隈陸奧林董加籐之流相比擬，但幾年來主腦人物有過政治惑星的宇垣，美國友人的野村，保守派的有田佐藤，親軍派的松岡白鳥，以至介乎二者之間的前任閣揆廣田，從陸軍到海軍從舊派到新派，幾乎都逐一試騐過。其無所成就則殊無二致。顯然這裏的中心問題並不關乎人材的强弱。</p>
<p>在歷史上雖也不乏以外交挽救國家於危厄的前例。然而外交終究僅屬全盤政治中的一環，牠的運用並不能與整個國運脫輻而獨立。今日日本外交方面的條件並不一定比其軍事政治經濟各方更壞，但因所望奇奢，以是失敗也最慘。他們幻想外交可濟軍事政治之窮，但却又缺乏立塲，不講信義，一味投機取巧，對於列强的親疎遠近。惟以一時片面利害為標準。照這樣的外交，在任何時期自均難獲成功，但這裏的重心，其實並不盡在外交本身。而是日本整個國策使然，試就十年來日政府的言行動作作一檢討，當不難發現其支離動搖。前後矛盾，其反映於重大對外行動者亦患目標不明見異思遷，外交方面當亦不能外此。此决近衛再度登台，已經是日帝國主義最後扎挣的節段。松岡的任務也自然比前此為艱困。如其自就任之始即沉穩從事，不輕事更張，雖亦未必能有所匡救。但當亦不致比其前任遭遇更大的失敗。但他却急不暇擇。妄圖以締三國同盟僥萬一之倖。同時却又困於國力與處境。不能立即作百八十度的國策轉變以冒險急進，而仍舊要相當保持小即不離的態度。佇候國際形勢的非常演變發生再以輕微代價取重大收穫。無如其對於國際局面的估量，自歐戰以至對中國美蘇各方態度，無不全與事實相左，雖英美反應。尙微嫌迂緩，而日本處境已陷於淮退維谷　轉側為難，這種情勢完全是日當局自己招致的結果。</p>
<p>現在日本南進已如箭在弦，侵華戰事尙無收拾良策；對英美關係已陷窮途，在對蘇外交以至軸心方面亦復無所收穫，這是日本外交上的絕境。也是其整個國運的絕大危機。</p>

<h3>歐戰痛史（三）　法國悲劇中三主角</h3>
<p>（三）窮於肆應的萊諾</p>
<p>萊諾自倫敦回巴黎後，國會復會在卽，除却宣布加緊封鎖之外，巳沒有充分時間作何舉措。實則加緊封鎖的消息，並不能使人發生伺種印象，卽在他本人亦未能有何信念。去冬萊諾尙在財政部長仟內時，他曾立在封鎖部長和軍備部長之間，笑着說道，希望戰爭能早達勝利目的，靠第一位朋友（指封鎖）成分少，靠第二位朋友（指軍備）成分多。消息靈通的法國人，對於封鎖多不大信任，而各議員在休會期中，亦從他們選民方面，聽到政府宣言的反響不佳。因此他們派代表去　達拉第，問他何時「執行萊諾政府的死刑。」他們以為愈早愈好。可是達拉第早巳成竹在胸，知道萊諾傾覆在卽，不願自已冉下手去推倒。總而言之，當此存亡危急之秋，法國議會中的滑糟戲劇，依然還是興高彩烈的排演着。</p>
<p>在短兵相接的前幾天，萊諾秘密對他的手下說，假使衆議院中棄權的人不超過六十票，他已覺得很是僥倖了。同時社會黨首領萊翁勃倫使人傳言於外，說萊諾並不是主張大舉進攻的人，適和反對黨所散布的謠言相反。更從他方面探悉，萊諾和軍事領袖會議後，知道他們暫時並無此種計劃。當開戰後最初幾個日中，一般人卽以為長期戰爭，可使德國屈膝，這種觀念，在倫敦亦盛行一時。英國前陸相悟立廈不萊曾宣言過「我們可以安安穩穩的獲得勝利嗎？」</p>
<p>達拉第知道法國防禦有隙可乘，亦非不知送交國會中各委員會的統計，不少錯誤。自去年九月以迄今年三月的半年之中，有時他深抱悲觀；但却聽任法國相信「我們可以不費大力擊敗敵人，」因此人望愈孚。當達拉第辭職的時候，竟有一個議員警惶失措的喊着萊諾所領導的戰爭，不復成為「民治國的戰爭」了。</p>
<p>法國既別無遠大計劃，祇有回到加緊封鎖的一條路，因於四月七日在挪威沿海敷設水雷，以阻止鐵砂輸往德國。德國卽於四月九日侵略丹麥挪威，作為答復。這時法國倒閣運動已不成問題；德國的主動巳保全了萊諾內閣的生命。然而法國政府和司令部所能借箸籌劃，以防止國家大患的「等候」政府當局或三軍司令了。他們時期，却從此失去了。</p>
<p>法國政府對於採取主動的敵人，不論如何應，總難免落後一着，不生效力。四月九日上午七時，在外交部舉行的會議，就是一個預示。兩日後，魏剛啟程赴叙利亞，總理對於這位未能畀以全國統帥權的司令，為之送花餞行。其時達拉第甘茂林的結合，始終未見動搖。</p>
<p>自四月九日起，時局急轉直下。法國的命運已不再靠着經年累月的失着，至此將作一總淸算而禍及全國了。魏剛難於五月十九日被任為總司令，實則大勢巳去，縱有通天本領，也無可挽回了。</p>
<p>負法國軍事責任四年之久的總司令和陸軍部長，直至事到臨頭，方始　責，而就仟祗有數星期的萊諾總理，不僅須擔負一已之罪，且須代幾位前任總理受過。</p>
<p>在兩星期中，事情實在變化得太快，使人意想不到，以致萊諾有好幾回竟弄得意亂神昏，毫無決斷，對於法國艦隊的如何處置，就是一個顯例‘他這時殆已心亂如蔴，不能適應事變。他對於事變的反應，不能效法拿破倫或克萊孟梭的親目出馬，臨機應變，却深藏在寓所之中，草擬演說稿，預備在無綫電中廣播，卽使語語動人，究於大局伺補。并且命運注定他在播昔器前，每决總須宣布失利的消息，弄得法國人都視為「晦氣星」，而不敢收聽他的廣播演說。總之，萊諾的優柔寡斷，舉棋不定，早巳十分明顯，如同時畀特戈爾將軍和鮑多恩以兩個要職，便可顯見他的手忙脚亂了。</p>
<p>法國法律規定得很是明白，主持戰局是政府的責任，司令不過執行作戰事宜而已。所以法國陸軍，平時須受文官指揮，不能決定國家軍事方針。民治國在當初立此原則，原是仿照列代明君先例。豈知軍人與政府間的關係，時栘勢易，竟與立法本旨，大相逕庭。政府以便宜行事之權授與將帥，自以為可保國家安寗，而不知道是放棄職責，自欺欺人。</p>
<p>法蘭西第三共和國中，軍人與政客的關係，向來不甚圓滑，在一九一四年以前，國會中無數黨派之爭都由反軍閥主義而起。軍隊司令常為攻擊和澈查的目標，不得不時刻留意，便負責者深具戒心。</p>
<p>一九一四年以後，法國戰勝的軍人當然聲望隆重，「總司令部決無錯誤」之說，更傳遍四方。軍政兩界本積不相能，這時軍人勢力抬頭，漸有獨斷獨行之意。勝利者的受人敬仰，風靡全國。舊派旣盤踞不去，新進遂無由升遷，昌言新兵器和新戰術的莫不屈居人下。倘有一個少校或上校級軍官談起坦克車在禾來戰爭中的威力，一班將領祇是一笑置之，以為不啻讀一篇理想小說而巳</p>
<p>豈知軍事形勢今昔已大大不同，安能固執不化。法國的第一失着，就是不知道「領土的佔領」，不能像拿破倫一般的用兵，不惜任伺代價，期在敵人領土上作戰。這就是所謂「禦敵於境內，不如禦敵於境外」。法國因純取守勢，於是遂漸養成一種迷信馬奇諾防綫的神秘觀念，减少攫取主動的精神。</p>
<p>實則軍事上的攻守戰略，必須隨機應變，豈能膠柱鼓瑟，所謂運用之妙，在乎一心，如在一九一四年至一九一五年時，法軍重砲不足，假使在此時採取攻勢，必致鑄成大錯，當然非堅守不可。後來主張守勢的人，多藉口法國人力不足，不能採取大規模攻勢戰。然在現代戰這祇仗物力不仗人力的時代，此說果可信嗎？假使法國有着十個或十五個機械化補充師團，卽使德國人口兩倍於法國，誰能說法軍無力阻止德軍的進攻呢？（未完）</p>

<h3>男子性慾淡薄不一定是病態</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>常聽見人家說：男子性慾淡薄卽是病態。更有人說：男子性慾减退，可以測知其生命之將盡！這種聳人聽聞的謬論，其目的無非在鼓勵人們去縱慾，為害之大，甚於刀槍殺人</p>
<p>我們的論證：男子性慾淡薄，不一定是病態。因為婚後的有為男子，事業的慾望每勝於愛情。或因心性的涵養漸深，或因配偶的不滿其意，對於性慾一事也日漸呈淡薄之感的。但並不是痿弱無能之謂。因為當美景良宵，興之所至；或是夫婦言歡，逢塲作戲，他必益發的顯其活潑雄偉，旣以歡暢自己的心神，復以慰藉美人深藏在內心中的繾綣而熱烈的恩情。所以此種男子不但無妨於愛情，且有助於愛情永恒地長生！</p>
<p>可是有種男子因早年犯有自凟，遺精，早婚，荒淫縱慾，使生殖腺內分泌液（即精液）大受虧損者，則凡早洩陽痿，發育不全，精力渙解，精薄不育，腎虧腦弱，神經衰弱等症象即不一而足。此種男子每有兩種不同的表現：一因性生活上得不到樂趣，感覺人生厭倦，而陷入悲觀的苦境中，以致性慾淡薄，這當然是病態無疑；二因身虧反而慾旺，在此冬天的漫漫長夜，每頻頻欲試，引起其妻子的興奮，但在眞實的性生活上，反呈曇花一現，或竟完全不能人道。這怎能不引起妻子的憎恨呢？由此夫婦失歡，愛情破裂，而演出私奔，離婚等種種家庭悲劇者，時有所聞；竟因症象惡化，形成未老先衰，短命殀殤者亦多不勝計！</p>
<p>息有上述症象，則不可與性慾淡薄混為一談，必須及早作澈底治療，庶可免嚴重的後患！治療之法：據世界名醫及余等經騐，均以服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為對症特效。因此劑發明最早，監製最精，成分名貴，含有生殖腺內分泌素十字形結晶體，腦下垂腺結晶體，及鹿茸精，維他命等多種。所以功效確實，補力偉大，為任何類似製劑所不及。服後於一日夜間即可生精補腎，健腦活血，運服不斷，則更助長發育，滋養神經，調整新陳代謝，上述各症必於短期內治愈於無形，並可使精力益增豐足。中老人常服，則益壽延年，返老還童惟患遺精者，須兼服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片（五洲太和中西華英中英等大藥房均售）以固精關，制止遺洩，則開源節流，收效尤速。</p>
<p>患者李健飛君，湘人，年卅，結婚已十年，患遺精，腦弱，腎虧乏嗣，神經衰弱等症，雖屢服市上成藥，均鮮效果，近且症象惡化，友人促其赴港工作，亦以病阻，焦灼萬分！（以上自訴）上月來本診所診治，經詳察其症狀，知與所言相符，即囑其購「生殖素」兩打，「希米脫氏固精片」一打，使之兼服，並間日施用電療法，為時甫及一月，今已百病霍然，面現紅潤，精力豐足，夫婦愛情彌篤，聞將携眷赴港就任新職，則在溫暖而美麗的南國，叉添一對甜蜜的情侶矣！</p>

<h3>乳峯不美的補救法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>額上刻着電車道，雙乳好像癟荷包。</p>
<p>此等女性縱打扮，男子也要把頭搖。　　你不要小覷了女人胸前的一對乳峯！它眞有着萬分的魔力與寳貴的價値呢，老實說女性的乳峯如果愈高而愈有彈性，不僅可以把她丰腴的　部，婀娜的腰身，充分襯托出来，成一條美妙的曲線，使人陶醉愛慕之外。同時由於自身卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛，其性情亦無不溫良柔順，肌膚無不晶瑩潔白，面頰更無不紅潤而嬌艷。這樣的女郞，不惟在處女時代－也可以說求學時代，因智力品性的超人，可以名列前茅，做一個最優秀的學生，而為師長親友所愛。即一旦遣嫁而後，憑她這幾個優美條件，做丈夫的，還會不唯命是從，當她活寳一般看待嗎？</p>
<p>可是事實告訴我們，這樣的女性，亦是最難求，唯一的主要原因，因女子有生理上的諸種差異，如月經，妊娠等。所以每有妙齡年華的女子，額上已刻着許多電車軌道，肌膚粗糙，瘦骨嶙峋，而尤其覺得難堪的，一對乳峯，好似兩只乾癟的荷包。此等女性，雖滿塗脂粉，招搖過市，其不為男子嗤之以鼻者亦幾希？欲謀補救，祗有從速服以生殖腺卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」最為切實而可靠。蓋乳峯痿癟，健美喪失的主要原因，為生殖腺卵巢機能受月經不調，白帶不感，多產虧弱，營養不良等症所摧殘，如服女用「生殖素」後，則一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用，不特可以根治各症，且能使乳峯高聳，臀部丯腴，紅潤面頗，長駐靑春。</p>
<h3>遺精青年享難人生幸福</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>誰都知道，遺精是體弱的象微，患有遺精的靑年，若再因循失治，那虧弱的程度勢必加速地增高。最可怕的事，就是由遺精症引起的腦弱和腎虧！</p>
<p>男子體內的精液，好比機器內的機油，可以潤澤各部機能，而使之活潑，性愛的要求，允其是精液（即生殖腺內分泌）的活動所致。所以熱心地選擇配偶，互談戀愛，進行結婚，生男育女，組織家庭…開放着人生的燦爛之花，享受着人生無窮幸福！若男子由遺精失治而致腎虧，則必繼起早洩，陽痿；或因遺精使發育機能减弱。雖巳成年，而性器繼細，仍如童稚；或因精液稀薄，致久婚不育。凡此種種症象，旣難享新婚之樂，更非人生之福，世問靑年，由此而失戀失歡，陷入人世間之慘境者，何可勝數？共山遺精而致腦弱失眠，影響於求學與職業，到老來徒傷悲者，或竟短命殀殤者，亦比比皆是！</p>
<p>遺精的特效療法，唯行服「希米脫氏固精片」最有把握。因此藥確能鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，服後於當夜即可收安眠止遺之功。惟患者購服時，須認淸「希米脫…」字樣，免為雜藥蒙混，以致貽誤。至因遺精巳有上述症象者，須兼服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，精血及神經，連服一月，可以體重增加，精力强壯，百病消滅於無形。患者除服上述良藥外，若能親來本診所兼施電療注射等新療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>「大獨裁者」中的笑料</h3>
<p>這是先天下不足呢，還是大炮偶抱清恙、那棵X-7418-R炮彈出是出去了，但是並沒有到巴黎。離開家鄉不遠，它就像一隻肥豬般的臥倒在戰場上。即不爆發，亦不炸裂，竟是個杳無音訊。</p>
<p>土軍長官見此情景，大為詫異。於是下令派人去查看這炮彈不炸的原因。少佐下令給隊長，隊長給班開，班長給伍長，伍長在軍隊中已是芝麻路段綠豆般的起碼貨，卻不願冒此危險，就把命令傳給那小兵亨格爾。卓別林是一個最小的小兵，看看「身後」已無可再傳之人，只得硬著頭皮去查看那炮彈，為何不爆發！</p>
<p>亨格爾躊躇前進，這既不能進又不敢，一步挨一步的總算走近彈旁。可是那惡作劇的炮彈，不但開動員噴火，竟繞著他打起轉來。他這一嚇非同小可，弄得魂靈出竅，直所謂「團團轉」了。觀眾看到這裏替他揑把汗事小，笑痛肚皮，倒是真的呢。然而天無絕人之路，那棵大炮彈，說時遲，那時快，嗤的一聲，竟不知所終了</p>
<p>卓別林所代表的亨格爾，在軍隊中還做了許多不尷不尬的事。那時候的高射炮製作粗笨，炮口筆直朝天，炮身之勞附有窺察敵機者所坐的椅子。亨格爾也曾一度充當高射炮手，吊在半空中從窺視鏡中察看敵機，瞄準炮口，那副神情決非畫師所能描寫。</p>
<p>亨格爾是個心腸軟，神經弱的人，經不起在炮火之下生活，兩耳受震過甚，成了一種心病。竟把所有的事情忘記得乾乾淨淨，連話都說不來了。後來解甲歸田，休養病體，恢復原狀之後，土馬尼亞已為獨裁者所統治。他無以為生，便做理髮匠糊口。</p>
<p>這時候銀幕上的卓別林，住在猶太區中，回復平民本色。他的三件法寶——圓頂硬氈帽，竹節灣手杖、和十四寸大的廣頭破皮鞋——都一一上了身。當然他那裏還有配身的衣服穿，一件又短又窄的上裝，兩只燈龍型的　褲管，硬領，黑領帶，小馬甲，……把卓別林整個的身子裹住了。他坐不定，立不穩，揚杖舉帽，忙個不停。走起路來，大皮鞋的足跟先著地，拖泥帶水，放著八字形，搖搖擺擺，好像沒有骨頭，祇有一根銅絲撐在裏面似的……</p>
<p>他這幅商標和作風，從一九一四年以來就一直如此，直到今天。心是看過「從軍夢」，「尋子遇仙」，「淘金記」，以及「城市之光的」的人，眼睛一閉，這個「寶貝的活現形」便在目前了。這裏也無庸多所描摹。</p>
<p>亨格爾的戀人漢娜Hannah，她是卓別林的老婆寶連高黛德女士，她在劇中不以亨格爾的　副裝束和行動為怪，反而死心塌地底愛他。當他被獨裁者驅逐時，開始和她談情說愛。卓別林一幅怕羞和難為情的樣子，也　叫人回味。</p>
<p>亨格爾因在理髮之時誤用白漆塗在衝鋒隊員的面上這簡實是老虎頭上拍蒼蠅，得罪了他們罪該萬死。從此那奇妙莫測的故事，便一路開展起來了</p>
<p>理髮匠被誤認為獨裁者後，在宮中和拿破裏尼相晤，一真一假，一個神氣活現，一個肚裏明白，錯綜複雜，弄得大家莫名其妙。當這兩位獨裁者在宮裏理髮時，大家積不相下，因為誰的椅子應該升高些，這難題竟無從解決了。</p>
<p>假獨裁者的樣子，表面上要做成一個獨裁者的樣子，而內心卻非常痛苦，非常矛盾，有幾個畫面他舉著右手行禮，面上一副愁容幾乎要哭出來了</p>
<p>卓別林的攝制這「大獨裁者」，曾費兩年心血，決不粗制濫造。自編劇，對折，導演，以至配音樂，置佈景沒有一樣，不躬自親嘗。劇中有幾個偉大的場面，為卓別林前此所演各影片中所從來未有。除了第一場歐戰場面外，已如前述外，還有不少地方都曾費了不少金錢，去製道具和佈景。</p>
<p>那尊土馬泥亞的新式大炮，即為此劇而特造的。計炮身長一百尺，重六千五百磅，造價美金一萬五千元，像真炮一樣能放射炮彈。為「大獨裁者」中費錢最大的一個道具。</p>
<p>獨裁者的府邸，大辦公廳，迎接外國元首，即拿破裏尼時，火車站上的熱鬧場面，馬路兩旁的民眾歡迎情狀，盛大的宴會，富麗唐皇的跳舞廳等，都是不惜工本的大佈景。誰說醜角演戲不必化大本錢呢？卓別林真為演滑稽劇者，大大揚眉吐氣了。</p>
<p>卓別林對於這片子的命名為「大獨裁者」其中也有一翻波折，而且結果他認為是個得意之作。起初他本想題名為「獨裁者」，但是臺難斯氏已經使用此名於前，百拉蒙公司握有這劇名的主權。如果卓別林再想使用這名稱的話，他非得付百拉蒙以二萬五千元不可。他總算會打算，便在「獨裁者」之上面加了個「大」字，以示區別。事後對他人家說：「我叫我的片子為“The　great　Dictator”——「大獨裁者」——三個字，完全免費」！</p>
<p>「大獨裁者」將上演之前，卓別林曾招待紐約泰晤士報的訪員去參觀。當放映至卓別林所飾之獨裁者，步上一輛廠式汽車時，一位軍官跑來朝他行敬禮。於是鏡頭拖了開來，在銀幕上現出至少一百　民眾在那裏歡迎呼喊的偉大場面。</p>
<p>那訪員問卓別林道：「你在那裏弄到這個場面」？</p>
<p>卓別林真妙得很，他可說道：「我們從那晨弄到這個場面？你猜猜看我們那裏弄來的？從德國拍來的呢—我所僱用的第五縱隊由德國偷拍得來。希特勒不但是我所扮演的腳色。他還為我支付攝製費用。倒省了我不少的錢。你想奇也不奇呢」？（完）</p>

<h3>戀愛問題與結婚的安全問題</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>關於結婚問題之研究，英國愛凱曾力主戀愛結婚，凡是不本著戀愛結婚的，都斥為不道德，夫婦的成立，一定要根據著戀愛，才可造成圓滿的家庭；但是一方面仍主張自由結婚；苟其愛情冷淡，就不妨脫離，別求新愛，這也可以見得戀愛決不能保證它有永續性，也可以見得複愛的必不能免，更可見得女奸通發生的原因。</p>
<p>因雙方戀愛而結成的夫婦，似乎可以圓滿了，然而或是因著性機關的發生異常。不能滿足她的性欲；或是久居以後，大家天天接觸著，互相暴露他的短處，發生精神上的不滿足，那末愛情就漸漸泠淡下來，發生家庭間的破綻，於是就發生「性的變異要求」，弄得愛情一天減少一天，發生離婚等的悲劇，「結婚，是戀愛的墳墓」這句諺語，的是不錯，結婚的最好方法，與其戀愛結婚，不如努力珍惜婚後的性健，什麼叫做性健？就是結婚的基礎，並不單建築在戀愛上，還顧到實際上的性欲問題。學業，性情，身份，雖可作為變愛的條件，但若結婚以後，若發現在任何一方有性的缺點的話，那末當初的愛情，就不能夠永續的維持，必然大失所望，另外向其他的人，發生愛情；所以戀愛若無性健為之後盾，很少白頭偕老的，不是發生離婚，就是發生奸通。但此種弊害的補救，一定要用最新的科學方能濟事，因為性力渙散，是由於主宰性欲的青春腺斷傷所致，故對症治法，必須服以德國正真睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」蓋「補體康」之成分，係採自動物之睾丸與卵巢，凡早衰，腎虧，房事不能，能顯驚人效果，功能補腦，補腎，補血，年老人服之，可返老還童，其女用者功能調經種子，此在臨床上久著卓效，備為中外醫家所信賴，可說為腎虧之特效良藥。</p>
<h3>遺精受誘惑最多</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>青年人之所以犯上自漬，其動機都受外界的引誘最多，時出入於公共場所或喜涉足於歌臺舞榭，一旦為聲色所惑，而以自漬為其補救之策者，殊不乏人。要知自漬為損傷腦力及性機能最大惡習，且因無對象，一轉念間即可行之，故易成癖，犯之既久，其害漸深，年來醫學界人士，已早在大聲疾呼，警戒青年勿以自漬為可行，然言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，犯此者與日俱增，認為青年健康的一大威脅。</p>
<p>自漬最早顯現的病象，厥為遺精，精為入生健康的基礎，如遺數過密，病變百出，能致神經衰弱，發育不全，腦弱腎虧，為求健康計，應速治療，此可服以德國「耐而斯遺精片，」即可制止，但必須戒絕自漬，嚴守攝生，則藥力之發揮愈大，平時多作有益於事業之工作，勿閑遊，勿涉足男婦女交雜之處，此亦預防自漬之必要辦法。</p>
<h3>淋病療法之偉大的實現</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士五克春醫師</p>
<p>患淋病之人，無時不感到擇藥時之彷徨無措者，蓋一經誤治，後患無窮，急性者化而為慢性，慢性者則續發睾丸炎，攝護腺炎，等之合並症，嗣絕滅育，身體殘廢，深可歎也</p>
<p>夫淋病之治療界，自透膜殺菌療法宣告失敗後，而一般之化學療法，又多名不符實，亦無珍貴之成績，可供吾人臨床上之使用，乃埋頭研究，不知費盡多少心血，幸由利耳珂禾氏，及林那塞氏等，發見淋病之改良化學療法自動性免疫療法，即用此法注射於人體內，以昂盛患者之抗淋毒素，使血內產生多量血球，以年滅潛伏內部之淋菌，其法已得全球醫家所公認，及德國彼德博士出，乃百尺竿頭，再進一步，以最精密之科學方法，製成為淋病內服藥「克淋儂」，經過多次之動物試驗，確證此藥為淋病特效藥，且毫無任何副作用。</p>
<p>因此法能昂盛人體抗淋毒素及白血球，所以此種淋病內服藥，對於男女一切急慢性淋，絕對可以根治，絕無不良之影響，此「克淋儂」一藥之發現，京即淋病療法中理想之效果的實現，在外用藥方面，男子可用「抗淋水」為坐藥，則不論淋菌匿藏深淺部分，均可一鼓削平，永遠根本解決。</p>
<h3>淋病講座</h3>
<p>— 姚菊嚴醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寧波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋病易致神經衰弱</p>
<p>因淋病至性神經衰弱，其症甚多，蓋淋病最易損壞生殖機能，吾人最所恒遇的攝護腺炎一症，往往容易把性神經弄成性神經衰弱之可能，因此患攝護腺炎者，不可不注意此等地方，從余廿年來之經驗，對於平素具有神經質之人，特別容易犯上此症。患此雖然攝護腺並不十分腫大，但如行觸診方，病人好感到難於忍耐之痛楚</p>
<p>對於淋病根本而迅速的療法，必然有科學的根據，否則，任你口上筆底說得如何三五天可愈，而事實總是事實，在一般之局部手術，也不見有何功效，因為淋菌逃竄之迅速，及其普遍，有如水銀洩地，無孔不入，所以要求淋病全治之方法，首得作全盤精密的統籌，才可有濟，在這裏，以我悠久之經驗，德國靜電療，及X線療法，是理學療法中超然之淋病療法，而淋病內服藥中最新化學製劑，牠具有抗淋噬菌的作用，對於善於逃竄的淋菌，有包圍而噬殺之偉力，對於頑固之淋病，即可短期內根本解決。並能使性神經恢復原來健康，此為任何淋病療法中所不及的。兼治梅毒橫痃下疳性神經衰弱，診時：上午九時至下午六時，自即日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角</p>
<h3>鎭咳止嗽秘訣</h3>
<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>不論中醫西醫，對咳嗽一症，均屬難治之症，故肺病之多，遠過任何傳染病，而其死亡率，亦實覺驚人也。故一般人不可以為傷風咳嗽，是一小疾，而不加治療，倘不幸而由咳嗽的不治變為肺病，則患者亦不應悲觀，其實肺病亦非如一般醫家所說那樣可怕，只要攝生和醫治得法，其他並無神秘，依余經驗所得，『補肺拿爾』一藥，頗有鎮咳治肺之特效，不論病狀至二三期之吐血，服此已能絕對根治，然當在治愈時間，宜安靜切勿勞動，並多攝取當有滋養之食品，則所患尤易治愈了，此肺癆必愈之條件。</p>

<h3>莊票之流通與背書</h3>
<p>— 怒濤　一·槪述</p>
<p>莊票者，乃錢莊出蔡，預的一定金額，由出票錢莊無條件擔仟支付之票據，爲一種經濟上之信用證劵，學者稱爲預的證券，按諸票據法上之分類，莊票在法律上當視爲「本票」，惟莊票基於錢莊，由來已久，遠在票據法公佈施行（民國十八年十月三十日）之前，故工商界仍沿用舊名（莊票），而並不用法條而改名本票也。（惟他埠習慣，間亦有不稱莊票者，例如漢口在百元以內奢名莊票，百元以上稱交票，廣州之憑票，揚州之紅要，皆屬莊票也。）惟銀行出票自任付軟之票據，則概稱爲銀行本票，而簡稱「本票」也。其在法律上之身分，二者　無分軒輊也。（編者按：今日上海錢莊之莊票，已註明有本票字樣，蓋遵票據法之規定也。）</p>
<p>莊票之形式，大致相似，惟並不一律。通常以堅厚之宣紙爲之，白色居多，間有印以淡色之花紋者。有卽期遠期之分，卽如莊票見票卽付，遠期自五天至十天不等（上海市錢業業規第四十一條規定至多十天）。票面金額，依法凡見票卽付並不記載受款人之莊票，其金額至少五十元（票據法施行法第十條），惟實際上例多鉅額，多至數十百萬，亦習見之。通常爲無記名式，其第一行爲號數，第二行爲金額，第三行爲出票莊名號（有圖章而無簽名），第四行爲日期（卽期莊票寫當天日期，遠期莊票寫到期之月日，而並無「到期」字樣），騎縫處亦編字號，金額日期及騎縫上均幣細花紋之戳子。大小文宇均無一定格式，由各莊目定也。</p>
<p>錢莊歷史悠久，莊票信用卓著，更在銀行本票之上。在國內工商界固可以通行無礙，卽外商銀行及洋行亦皆樂於接受，且更較銀行本票爲信任。昔者銀打本票尚未習用之時，外商銀行及洋行與華商交易，殆有非莊票不予收受之槪。故滬上工商界習稱莊票爲金蝴蝶，得滿天飛行而絕無罣礙也。</p>
<p>二，莊票信譽卓著之原因</p>
<p>莊票之性質，形式，種類以及其在金融界之地位，巴簡述如上，夫莊票所以能博得社會之信任，獲得「金蝴蝶滿天飛」之佳譽，良非偶然，考其原因，的有左列數端：</p>
<p>（一）莊票基於錢莊，由錢莊無條件付款。查錢莊歷史悠久，在我國往昔金融界之地位，堪稱首屆一指。在新興銀行未發達之時，任何商埠大邑例必有若干權戚錢莊，執全埠經濟之牛耳。故莊票亦因此而流通無阻，時間愈久，習慣益深，其博得社會之信任亦愈形堅固矣。</p>
<p>（二）莊票由錢莊出票，錢莊卽爲莊票之主債務人。查錢莊在過去皆爲獨資或合夥組織（近則亦有依照銀行法改爲股份有限公司組織，然究竟仍以合夥組織爲絕對的多數，外埠更然），故資本主或合夥人係負無限或連帶無限責任，故莊票之付款保障似較雄厚。</p>
<p>（三）自滬地而言，匯劃莊爲錢業中之俊傑，其「入園」之資格與手續釐訂頗嚴，財力信譽均甚雄厚，故其所出莊票自能不脛而走矣。</p>
<p>（四）自過去事實言，莊票之偽造僞簽，殊屬尠覯。卽出票莊不幸倒閉，對於莊票之執票人，亦必優先償訖，不致受累，此點最足取信於社會也。</p>
<p>（五）又自滬地而論，上海市錢業業規亦規定：「……凡往來戶向錢莊出立莊票，或已付莊，或已買貨，或已貼現，查明確實，有賬可稽，有貨可指，或監守自盜，或自受愚騙，票入人手者，無論何時均不得回錢莊請求掛失止付。……」（見該業規民國二十二年修正條文第四十五條第一項。但並非絕對不能掛失，不過掛失條件與手續釐訂甚嚴耳。）可見持票無異獲現，絕少糾葛，其能受人歡迎，殆爲必然。</p>
<p>（六）又因我國票據之承兌（銀行或商業承兌）與貼現尚初呈萌芽，支票之流通又欠普遍，故實際上亦極需要一種票據通貨，在商人資命融通上更見迫切，今莊票旣還在銀行本票之先而習用，自易於流通社會而駕乎銀行本票之上也。</p>
<p>（七）此外，我國工商界素嗜保守，而新興之銀　，雖亦專設「往來」一部，但交易手續上終較錢業爲機械而週密，故各地占有絕對多數之舊式或牛新式之工商企業，每樂於與錢莊往來，此亦不失莊票風行之一理也。</p>
<p>三，莊票之習慣與法律</p>
<p>莊票例多「無記名」式（屬稱小抬頭），且因信用卓著，故在社會上得以交付（卽票據之栘轉）而轉讓　權利，輾轉流通，絕無限制。授票者固以交付莊票爲「靠硬」甬語，卽體面），而受之者亦必樂收而不之疑也。此在票簽俱眞之莊票，固無問題，且因斯故，莊票可滿天飛也。</p>
<p>惟無記名式之票據，轉手一多，其原來之請求出票人每難於查悉，而莊票金額十九甚鉅，一旦發生偽造或僞簽其於最後之執票人自必不利。然轉讓時習慣上並不經背書之手續，故最後之執票人除向其授出者交涉外，無法追索於其他之「前手」（卽所有以前曾參加授受之人）如言保障，殊覺薄弱。</p>
<p>莊票之無須背書轉讓，不僅習慣如此，法條亦然。蓋無記名式之票據依法可不經背書而轉讓也。鄙意習慣法律均屬欠當，殊官商榷。</p>
<p>習慣之所以認爲莊票無須背書而轉讓，其唯一理由卽莊票爲金蝴蝶，信用卓著，無背書必要。然商事日繁，人心不古，不經背書，殊足疑慮。以事實言，過去不談，最近卽有某家紗號據稱被人以僞莊票騙去雙馬紗棧單二張（二十件），登報報該二棧單聲明作廢。而另一紗號則謂係以合法受買，該偽莊票並非本號付出，故棧單不能作廢，亦登報聲辯。此項糾紛究竟孰是孰非，自不容局外人信口論斷，有待法律之解決。惟由此可知此票必已轉手甚多，但未經過背書而轉讓甚權利，僅以票據之交付而移轉也。現旣發生眞僞問題，當感漏缺背　之非宜也。如有背書，交涉之方式可以肯定，保障亦必大增也。</p>
<p>至論法律，何以不規定無記名式票據亦須背書而轉移？蓋無記名票據者以占有爲證明權　之要件，何人占有何人卽爲收款人，可不問其過去授父之經過或來源也。且尚有另一立法理由，無須背書，易於流通，可促進票據通貨之遍也。惟筆者以爲近代商事日繁，票據之輾轉假手甚多，我國雖素重道德信譽，但良莠容或不齊，爲防患於非然，爲糾紛之公平解決，似以背書轉讓爲宜。且也，背書並不麻煩，空白背書（卽僅由背書人簽名，並不記戰被背書人姓名也），允覺便捷，須背書而轉移，似亦不致影響票據之流通也。且本粟乃信用證券，並非支付證券，其票面預的是吾無僞，究不能絕對肯定，如輾轉間　背書而行，則至少多一來踪，其於票據使用，似有利而尠弊也。</p>
<p>按票據法之規定，本票之法定必要條件有四；（一）表明其爲本票之文字，（二）一定之金額，（三）無條件擔任支付，（四）發票年月日。而我國莊票例無表明其爲本票之文字（銀行本票則有之），亦無「無條營擔任支付」之文藝，依法殊　不符，故莊票一旦　　糾紛，法律上是否承認其爲本票而　票城法之約束，似亦不無問題。最好自以台符法條爲是。</p>
<p>又莊票之「名一事實上亦欠普遍與統一，其使用習慣又因地區而不同，如莊票流通於埠際交易，則伺等不便！以上數點，殊值得錢業之考慮。立法方面，票　法本票一章，似嫌簡陋，亦頗多斟酌處也。</p>
<h3>中國戰時之經濟建設</h3>
<p>— 翁文灝</p>
<p>本文材料，由英文「戰時中國社引自經濟部長翁文灝博士關於戰時中國經濟情形之報導，叙述我國戰事以來之經濟建設情形，至爲周詳，特爲譯出，俾關心內地情形之人士，得明瞭目出中國區內經濟建設之一斑。閑言誌</p>
<p>七七事變以前，中國政府會草擬一個建立重工業的五年計劃，按此計劃，則重工業的建立，以河南，河北及江西三省爲主要區域。戰事爆發後，由於事實上的需要，迫使政府在我國內地建立起鞏固的經濟堡壘，在西南和西北各省，當局力謀礦業，電工，化工，機工，以及水電工業之發展，迄最近爲止，又通過了一個礦工建設的三年計劃，此計劃最大的目標，是在促進我國戰時經濟的「自力更生」，務使臻於「自足自給」之境地。</p>
<p>利用漢冶萍及大冶鐵廠遷出的機械，政府在四川省　內設立了一個規模宏大的精鍊廠，此外，籌設中之另一鍊鋼廠即將在同一境內開辦，雲南省也有一個精鍊廠行將設立，但當局計劃中發展鋼鐵工業的主要區域，則仍落在四川省境內。</p>
<p>輔助鍊鋼之用的新式電氣溶爐，在西南各地已很普遍地裝置起來，爲補救生鐵供給量不足起見，當局止積極地收買民營生鐵礦岩，藉以增加生鐵的供給量，本年度在四川和其他自由中國的區域內，生鐵的供給量巳有顯著的增加，預料在一年以後，鐵鋼二項的生產總量，足敷戰時軍事及工業所需而有餘。</p>
<p>煤礦脈的開拓，在政府積極的經營下，已著極大之成績，江西，河南，四川，山西，雲南，甘肅，西康諸省所發掘儲富質之煤礦脈，足供建設新鐵道及工業原動力所需之用。爲解決燃料的缺乏起見，政府新設了不少酒精廠。在自由中國廣大的領域裹，埋藏着地下的銅是被大量地開拓了，同時，政府還開辦了幾所新式電氣鍊廠。此外，如金，汞，銻，鋅，鎢的開鑿，亦甚積極，錫的產量，近年來已有飛速的猛　，銻鎢　項，中國依然佔着世界產額的首位，在我國對外貿易方面，錫，汞，鎢，銻大量的輸出，足證此類稀有金屬產量之激增</p>
<p>有十一所規模宏大的水電公司，分設於豫，蜀，黔，滇，晋，甘，諸省境內，另有三所範圍更爲廣大的水電公司，現正着手創辦中，一旦完成後，其所發之電得流　於自由中國之各處，需費當較城市水電公司爲低。</p>
<p>當中日戰事發生後最初一年間，沿海各地有一百六十八家機器鐵工廠移向內地，彼等之主要工作係從事於：（一）需品之製造；（二）原動力機之製造——如各種馬達及發電機是；（三）器具之製造；（四）生產工具之製造；（五）車軸以及其他運輸工具之製造。</p>
<p>此外，當局致力於電氣工業及化學工業之發展，也顯著成效，在最近設立的二十八個國營電氣工廠中，現正埋頭從事於電報零件之製造，其中有一個機器工廠，本來是專　電風扇的，目下正漏夜製造軍用無經電　音機，國民政府統治下的自由中國，已生產了鉅額之雷錢，海底靑報，眞空管，軍用電話機，乾電池以及其他供傳達消息所需的工具。至於化學工業方面，的有五十四家化工廠專事製造化學原料，其產品除供用以製造火柴及水鬥汀外，餘均直接用於軍需品之製造。</p>
<p>戰時中國經濟建設之最大企圖，在謀對外輸出的激增及本國產額之自給，不必依賴於外貨的輸人。在長期作戰的進行中，我國的對外貿易巳進入於一種新的階段了。政府儘量供給了國際貿易的需要以求增强國內財政的機構，同時還提高了國內人民的購買力，當我國自身的重工業還沒有充分發展的今日，增加對外的輸出實屬必需。我國對外輸出之物產可爲下列五類：（一）農產品類——如絲，茶，棉花，花生，生油和胡　等屬之，（二）森林產類——如桐油屬之，（三）家畜產類——如蛋，蛋製品，猪鬃，木材，羊皮，獸皮，皮袋等屬之，（四）礦產品類——如錫，銻，錫版等屬之。（五）手工藝產品類——如刺繡，絲織品等屬之。這些物產，每類每年所輸入之總額均在數千萬元以上。爲了促進對外輸出發展起見，國府擬訂了　項原則，此三項原　改良生產方法，生產貸款，及由政府直接經　踴，　，錫汞，桐油，鋼，毛，茶，木材等之出口。此類物產，每年輸入額的値六十萬元之譜，倘由政府積極經營，預料在不久後當可續有增加，鎢的產量，在過去二年間巳激增達三倍以上，錫的產量，最近也有驚人之發展，桐油在戰前本不足自給，近更一躍而爲我國主要之輸出品。</p>
<p>事變以前，中國雖爲農業國，但尚須輸入百分之二的洋米以補本國產量的不足，年來山於內地各處豐收的結果，已不再感到米量的缺乏，祇要運輸的方法能加以改善，在國民政府統治下之自由中國，食糧方面已無須有賴於外來的輸入了。</p>
<p>對於製衣原料的增加，也不容吾人加以忽視，棉之產量，在戰時已能自給，據可靠之估計，一九三七年度全國棉花的產量已達一千二百萬擔以上，除自給外，尚可有相當數量之輸出，但至今猶引起吾人認爲無限遺憾者，卽我國之主要產棉區，均落入日人手中，西南一隅，列年來棉花之產糧本屬甚微，目不足自始，而該區供紡織所用之纖維也感不足，政府爲補救此一缺憾起見，已在蜀，滇各省進行改良棉花種子的工作，並從河北，山西，河南各省運輸其多餘之棉花至西南各地，俾西南一隅之紡織廠得無原料稀少之慮。</p>
<p>政府近方致力於增進棉花產糧，及扶助內地手工業之發展，自一九三八年起，切實地實施了動員戰區難民參加墾殖運動之計劃，其地區則遍於雲南，河南，廣西，江西，福建五省，據精確之統計，的有三十一萬難民開墾五百四十萬畝荒蕪未開拓的土地，中中交農四大銀行，和農本局則大量放軟以供開拓荒土之用。</p>
<p>在另一方面，過去三年來對日經濟封鎖的實施，極爲有效，此種封鎖且在繼續推行中，其所收之效果甚大。而日人所企圖「以戰養戰」之迷夢，也經我國當局嚴厲的處置，使其不能達到目的。</p>
<p>首先，在一九三九年八月七日，國府公佈了各地物產禁運條例，規定有兩類物品是屬於禁運範圍之內，第一類爲製造軍需品之原料，如煤，鹽，鑛產，棉花　。另一類雖不能直接供軍需品製造之用，但此類物品倘爲敵國所有，彼等卽可輸往第三國以換外幣，增强其國內財政的機構，此類物品以獸皮，羊毛，豬鬃，大豆等屬之。據軍政當局及海關人員之報告，過去所有之出口貨中，祇少有六十餘種同時輸送日本，當局爲防止此種現象之繼續存在起見，特設水陸運輸辦事處解決此事，並下命各主管部大量收買自由中國內所有上述二類之物品，以免不肖之徒得秘密私運出口，無論從那一方面估計，當局極力阻止日人在佔領區及前方利用我國資源的措置，是械易奏效的。</p>
<p>雖然在一九三八年度，我國對日輸出品之總値爲一萬一千六百萬元，但到了一九三九年度，已减至六千六百萬元。當局爲謀補足私運出口所受之損失起見，業已訂立了一個抵制日貨之條例，此條例包括由日佔領區，帝國本部及其殖民地各廠所製的物品，這是一個切實有效的抵制方法，使日人無法將其產品換取法幣，購買外滙以獲得生產所需之原料，並縮小其國外市塲之範圍。</p>
<p>與抵貨運動同爲當局所密切注意者，乃是國民日用品的需要與供給問題，政府現正積極扶植小廠及手工業之發展，要使國民不去購買低廉的日貨，我以爲最好是在增進我國的土產</p>
<p>再回頭講到抵制日貨運　，它已不限於中國本部的一隅，在南洋羣島一千萬華僑間，也已展開了此運動之序慕，且極有成績，今日全世界各處，莫不紛起響應予日貨市塲以致命之打擊，其允値得吾人感奮者，卽愛好和平之國家的英，美，印，澳等國，刻正對日進行長期之經濟戰，以擴充此項運動之範圍，共同抵制日貨之侵人。</p>
<p>除此以外，我國政府復在日佔領區展開激烈的遊擊戰，進行破壞日人經濟基礎之工作。由於佔據這不能儘量控制之後果，日本在一九三九年輸入佔據區物品之總值　達二萬一千萬元，這數字和一九三七年的一萬五千萬元，一九三八年二萬萬元相較，該是一個驚人的激增</p>
<p>我必須明白指出的，卽此種製字的增加，就日本整個對外輸出方面言之，乃是一種病態的現象，因爲日方對佔領區輸出愈增，則日本卽减少其輸往其他各處之貨物，彼等僅能獲得日幣及僞幣，而不能獲得所需之外滙，外强中乾的日本，是十分需要外匯以購買工業製造品之原料的。因此，目下日本對華沿海諸省輸出之激增，無異將可能獲得之外匯，向其佔領區作大量之投資，吾人可斷言，日本的這種投資　無利益可獲，除非彼等調整淪陷區之經濟情形，積極開發自然資源，增加共產量，俾得保持日本工業之輪繼　旋轉不已。</p>
<p>綜上所述，日方對華輸出之激增，顯然爲减弱其國力的一種擔負，我國政府對淪陷區所施行之破壞政策，實予日閥在其所佔領各地進行任何建設計劃之美夢，致以無限之打擊。</p>

<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>—十一月二十三日—</p>
<p>以出口言，上海所受歐戰的影響也非常深刻，例如對於德國的貿易，可說全部斷絕，對於比荷等國的貿易，也大見减低，今年十個月的數字祇有去年的百份之一而已。但是以整個的出口貿易而言，而爲滙價的變動，以及對於英屬印度·緬甸·香港·荷印·菲列濱·新加坡·泰國等亞洲各地的發展，與夫對英·美等國貿易的躍進，仍見良好的貿易成績。除一月份外由二月份的七千二百九十萬元升爲叫月份的九千三百七十萬元。五月以後，因滙價回鬆，不利出口，由五月的一萬五千一百七十萬元，减爲七月的九千八百七十萬元。八月份起外滙大體回緊，出口貿易又由八月份的一萬二千萬元，升爲十月的一萬三千五百萬元。</p>
<p>研究上海十個月來的貿易情形，可以分爲三個階段，第一階段是由一月至叫月，第一階段是由五月至七月，第三階段是由八月至十月，各階段情形如表所示：所以演變成這三個階段的貿易情形，由前二節的分析中，可以如道國際局勢對於貿易的影響是有極大的關係。但是另外還有一個問題，就是貿易與滙價的聯繫，依照統計所顯示：在第二第三兩個階段先因滙價的回鬆而出口减縮進口增加，後因滙價轉緊而出口增加進口减縮；在第一階段滙價盤小出口貿易也漸增，但進口貿易並不减縮反激進，似乎不合滙價鬆緊影響貿易的進退了。事實上可以這樣解釋。。卽在第一階段滙價的盤小是在人人心目中所預知的，進口商爲防滬價未來的緊勢趁滙價有利時報關進口，而在五月後滙價的究將趨鬆趨緊無人能加揣測，因之滙價遂全般的支配了貿易的進退是帶有季節性的原因，故此形成反常的現象。</p>
<p>今後上海貿易的趨勢究將如何，雖然不能妄加揣測，但在國際局勢所影響，貿易情形當然有變化，而國際局勢所影響於滙市的演變，也是支配上海貿易情形的一個重要因素，要無可疑的。（完）</p>

<h3>「郡主」伴舞</h3>
<p>— 萬歲</p>
<p>讀到了「郡主伴舞」的廣告，我以爲又是好萊塢電影「×宮春色」之類的前奏曲—一個公主，因不甘宮中枯寂，悄然離京，赴某咖啡館充舞女。某夕，遇某靑年紳士，一見鍾情，相與繾終，於是幾經波折，而成眷屬矣。但是讀下去之後，我的「以爲」完全錯了！我們的郡主不在好萊塢，而卽在中國的上海；更不是銀幕上的倩影，而是「金枝玉葉之身」！「孤島」上的噱頭雖然日新月異，然而以郡主之尊」，而下海伴舞，天下新奇刺激之事，還有甚於此者嗎？</p>
<p>自從「民間故事」電影風行以來，我們的風流小生已經不勝「邀請」之請而登律師廣告了，那末，在這「百年人生難得一遇之機會」中，不該聯袂而來，一獻身手嗎？私訂終身後花園怎及得公主拋彩球呢！</p>
<p>所謂「昨天開幕，人山人海」當然不是過甚之詞，那些未來駙馬爺是不會吝嗇區區二元門券的；何况『本護花之心」者更十百千萬倍於風流小生呢。</p>
<p>然而不幸的我們的郡主出了一個難題：每舞十元，坐台二百，出門五百—這還是「起點」，要達到搶得彩球的「錦標」，連「啟事」中也沒有明確的數目，祇是含糊其詞的「多加愛護指敎是幸」，「郡主之尊」大槪就是尊」在這里，想「攀龍附鳳」的駙馬爺請先看一看自己脚底下的支票吧，吾則，律帥廣告也不見得會生法律效力的。</p>
<h3>擴大滅鼠運動</h3>
<p>— 白兮</p>
<p>鼠疫又名黑死病，是一種可怖的傳染病症，傳佈力旣速，死亡率又高；通常流行於海港城市，在流行之前，鼠族必先患病，鼠疫菌藉蚤虱的媒介自鼠體傳染於人體，故名爲鼠疫。</p>
<p>鼠疫的症狀可分腺疫·肺疫。皮膚疫三類，其間以鼠蹊腺之腺疫最爲習見，以肺疫爲最險惡，共全身症狀以心臟衰弱，出血性炎症及强劇之神經症狀爲主，此等症狀當由鼠疫菌毒素之作用而來。腺疫的死亡率爲百分之三十至九十，肺疫染者殆難倖存。患病治愈者都有免疫性，但身體健康不易復原，故亦有死於驟發之惡病—一名鼠疫衰憊—的可能。</p>
<p>當鼠疫流行時，消毒工作的進行極關重要，患者必須嚴密隔離，流行區城亦不能與外間往來，不得已時並須焚燬共中房屋器具以防疫勢蔓延；此外可用預防接種，將鼠疫血淸或菌液注射以防傳染。</p>
<p>鼠疫發生於歐洲，流傳地帶至廣，我國東北諸省則常因旱獺之傳染而流行。最近寗波發現鼠疫，滬鄞密邇，交通頻繁，一般人頗以鼠疫有侵滬可能爲慮，江海關方面對此亦甚注意，現已訂定辦法，對浙東輪隻實施檢疫，進口時先泊吳淞經嚴密檢查並施行薰蒸消毒以防疫菌侵入。</p>
<p>預防鼠疫的根本方法，須從每個家庭做起，經常保持居室淸潔，掃除塵垢棄凈雜物，室內用具力求簡單，目須便於移動，使鼠類蚤虱無處匿跡，如果室內有鼠類發現，務須儘速捕滅。最近工部局正致力於鼠類的捕殺，該局衛生處設有捕鼠一科，市民隨時可請求該科派員捕鼠。據工部局統計，該科每月受市民要求捕殺鼠類達三萬頭以上。</p>
<p>爲了根絕鼠疫傳染的媒介物以保障市民的健康，滅鼠運動更有擴大推行的必要，我們希望租界當局以宜傳力量引起多數市民對鼠疫預防的注意，一致動員殺滅鼠類，在鼠疫流行聲中，這是極有意義的工作</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十二章　報告和解釋</p>
<p>我和霍桑趕到了醫院，經過了一度接洽，就有一個人領我們進入李芝範的病房裹去。病房中除了倪金壽外。還有一個渾身雪白的女護士。兩個人的臉上都顯得肅靜而緊張。那老人躺在病牀上，身上蓋了一條白色的單被。老人閉着眼睛，張開了嘴，在吐着沉重而急促的喘息，面頰上顯着兩攤紅色。</p>
<p>倪金壽低聲向霍桑說：「我趕來時就這個樣子。他不曾說過一句說話。他的眼睛曾一度張開，瞧見了我，又立刻閉攏了。」</p>
<p>霍桑瞧着那老人，也低聲說：「他的熱度好像很高，大概不會有說話的可能了罷？」</p>
<p>霍桑說到後面一句時，眼光移注到女護士的臉上。那護十非常靈敏，立刻搖搖頭，答覆霍桑的非直接的問句。我瞧見那老人的眼睛緩緩張開，不過他的眼珠似乎已沒有集中的能力，祇空洞地向上面的承塵呆瞧了一下，接着又閉攏了。</p>
<p>倪金壽向霍桑說：「他不能說話，也沒有多大關係。他的被刺的經過，松泉已說得很淸楚。」</p>
<p>霍桑點點頭，說道：「那很好。但我希望他能談話，不單是要他報告被刺的經過，却還希望他說明他行刺的經過。」</p>
<p>倪金壽微微一怔，他的驚異的眼睛向霍桑凝視着。原來他還沒有知道李芝範就是殺死王麗蘭的眞兇。他的驚異原是很自然的。</p>
<p>霍桑答覆倪金壽的無言的問句：「是的，他是這案子的眞兇。不過那也沒有什麼關係。他的行動我也可以想像得出。我看這老頭兒不中用了，我們留在這裏沒有意思。你應趕快打一個電報到蘇州去，叫他的兒子李守琦快來。」</p>
<p>倪命壽點點頭，說：「說起李守琦，我也得告訴你。蘇州警署的回電已經來了，李守琦的確是在昨天十八午飯時分到蘇州的。他今天還在蘇州。」（一七六）</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>維他命與容貌</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>每天獲得充足的維他命可以促進容貌的革觀</p>
<p>要得到眞正的美貌，優　的美容品，是很有力的帮助，同時對於身體健康的保持，也是很重要的，因爲身體健康，那末就有淸潔無疵的皮膚，健全潔白的牙齒，呼吸氣管不會有什麼疾病，也不會有什麼壞脾氣。</p>
<p>要保待健康，每天一定要吸收充分的維他命，下列的食品，對於身體的保健，開接　成美貌，是很有效力的。</p>
<p>一，牛奶：每天可以喝半磅或者一磅。</p>
<p>二，鷄蛋：如果能每天吃二個更好。</p>
<p>三，水菓：如橘子蘋果等，是很好的食品。</p>
<p>四，穀食：如麵包等，在早晨吃或者在下午作爲點心。</p>
<p>五，蔬菜：每天可以進食一種以上的蔬菜。</p>
<p>六，生菜：天吃一次。</p>
<p>上列的六種食品，是根據每個人所需的維他命甲，乙，丙，丁，而制定，因爲這四種維他命，具有下列功用：</p>
<p>維他命甲可以生長呼吸器管和消化器官的黏膜，抵抗疾病，並且能彀促進眼部的健康，增進目力，並能助長發育。</p>
<p>維他命乙對神經系很有裨益，對身體的發育，也大有補助維他命丙能彀產生血管和　節的內膜，對於齒牙和牙齦的健康，很有關係，間接並且能彀產生優美的性格。</p>
<p>維他命丁管理着人體裹鈣質和燐質的調劑，如果缺少了維他命丁，就足以促成蛀牙和軟骨病。維他命丁也有人稱爲日光維他命，因爲在以往人們要得到日光是很容易的，現代的建築物，阻碍着日光的照射，因此就不得不從食品方面，去　得這種所需要的維他命丁，在牛奶，鷄蛋，和魚肝油中，都含有適量的維他命丁。</p>
<h3>如何保護手部的美觀</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>一個主婦，因爲操作家務，手部是很容易變成粗糙的，所以對於手部皮膚的保護，是一件很急切的工作。</p>
<p>這裹的方法，可以試騐一下：</p>
<p>先用優美的霜膏，在把手洗凈以後，搽在手面手背各部，然後摩擦肘部，使皮膚柔軟，如果時間充裕，那末可以實行下列的動作：</p>
<p>（一）把肘部靠在檯上或別種地方，把手指伸直，用另一隻手在伸直的手指旁邊摩擦，正像在戴一隻很的手套一樣。</p>
<p>（二）把手伸直，左右搖動，搖得愈快愈妙。</p>
<p>（三）用手握拳，然後放開，照這樣川流不息而很快地做二分鐘。</p>
<p>（四）用手指做成彈鋼琴的樣子，（正好像你是在彈鋼琴）把手指移動得愈快愈妙。</p>
<p>上述的方法，可以使血液活動，促進皮膚的新陳代謝作用，無疑地，手部的皮膚，也可以姣嫩了，但必需有相當的恒心，方能奏效。</p>
<h3>幾種錯誤的美容工作</h3>
<p>— 縵雲</p>
<p>如果你也有這種錯誤</p>
<p>請試看改正　的成績</p>
<p>幾個眞正懂得美容藝術的中國婦女，她們的美容成績是很好的，然而有許多的婦女，因爲有若干美容上的錯誤，往往不能得到很好的效果，下列幾點，允其是時常發生的。</p>
<p>（一）在敷面粉之前，應該先敷胭脂，這樣可以使胭脂的顏色更爲和潤均勻，許多的婦女，都先敷面粉，然後敷胭脂，其實這種程序是錯誤的。</p>
<p>（二）在敷胭脂的時候，應當敷到下眼皮，並且向鼻部敷去，逐漸由深而淡，那末不致於在面頰和下眼皮之問，露出一條白綫的錯誤，可以免除了。</p>
<p>（三）有許多婦女愛用白色的面粉，其實只有白色皮膚的婦女，可以用白色的面粉，面色略黃的，所用的面粉的顏色，應該比皮膚的顏色較深，如果一個皮膚黝黑的婦女敷用了白色的面粉，自然不會和潤了。</p>
<p>（四）敷　粉的方法，普通一般　都是由鼻部開始而向而頰敷去的，這一種方法，其　是錯誤的，結果往往使鼻部光亮非凡。正當的敷粉程序是先敷在面頰，從耳旁起，最後纔敷到鼻部。</p>
<p>（五）眉毛的最優美的姿態是在中段略向上彎起一點，這可以和眼睛的形態相和諧，許多人都把眉毛畫成條弧形的綫，就不能產生最美的形態了。</p>
<p>（六）敷胭脂和面粉之前，應該用Vanishing　Cream作爲粉底子，有一部份婦女都用冷霜Cold　Crea日其實冷霜是在晚上敷了保護皮膚，而應該在早晨拭去的。</p>
<h3>保護皮膚的方法</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>要　容工作，產生優美的效果，對於皮膚的保護，是不容忽略的。你可以在每天晚上臨睡的時候，用淸潔霜或冷霜，蘸在手心和指尖。　着下面的方法做去，經過相當時候，你的皮膚，一定是十分光潤滑嫩的。</p>
<p>一，從頦部到耳朶摩擦。一，從鼻　到顴部摩擦。三，在眉心向上到前額摩擦。四，在眼睛四周摩擦。五，在鼻部向下摩擦。六，在頸部和肩部，再由後背向頭髮的終點摩擦</p>
<p>你可以參考左面的圖畫，實行摩擦，在去除淸潔霜或者冷霜的時候，也可以用同樣的方法。</p>
<p>頸部摩擦</p>
<p>頸部的皮膚也須相當的保護，在摩擦的時候，可以把頸項伸直，那頭向右面轉時，你可以在左面頸部摩擦，當你要在右面頸部摩擦的時候，頭就應該向左轉了，至於摩擦的時候，可以參考左面的圖畫。</p>
<h3>美容前的休息</h3>
<p>— 增</p>
<p>在　施美容工作之前，相當時間的休息是很重要的，一個女子，決不能從網球塲上回來，立刻穿上新衣，去參加宴會，她必須先要沐浴，吾則她的外貌，決不會美觀的。同時，每一個婦女，每天終得有一點點的時間，可以從事於　容工作，這一點，也可以說是，每一個女子應有的權利</p>
<p>這裹有一個方法，讀者不妨試試，效果一定很好，並且不需要很多的時間。</p>
<p>如果你的時間不允許你先沐浴（如能先沐浴更好），你可以坐在你的妝台面前的靠椅上，先用熱水洗面一次，然後用頭靠在椅背上，眼睛閉着，拋開一切的思慮，靜靜地休息五分鐘，嘴裹可以吃一點糖果，等到五分鐘過後，你就可以張開眼睛，實施美容，結果一定可以得到一種新鮮姣嫩的外貌</p>
<p>這一個方法，並不是筆者杜撰的，而是在紐的的裝飾專家亞爾瑪，亞秋女士的所著的裝飾課本裏記載着的。</p>
<h3>關於美容品的一點常識</h3>
<p>（一）所有霜膏，粉盒，胭脂的好蓋，應該在使用売畢以後，隨卽　緊這可以避免香味散去，並且可以防止狼藉。</p>
<p>（二）切不要在別人的面前，敷用美容品，允其是在男子的面前，因爲當一個男子看見一個女子在敷用美容品以前不完整的面貌時，很容易產生不良的印象。</p>
<p>（三）切不要借用別人的美容品，因爲美容品是絕對屬於個人的。你向別人借用美容品，定要受到別人的厭惡。而且每一個人所用美容品的顏色絕對不同，向別人借用，也不是一個好方法。</p>
<p>（四）當你的家中有客人到來的時候，最好爲她們預備好一點美容品，專供她們使用，從你一點上可以顯出主人的有思想和招待的周到。</p>
<h3>健康是美的條件</h3>
<p>— 節譯The　Woman</p>
<p>美麗基於健康，一個血液旺盛沒有暗疾的女子，她的全身一定很動人，再以化妝品和美容法相輔，無疑可以到達十分健美的地步。所以早起早眠，飲食有度，從事有規律運動以及避免刺激性食物這數條對於想走上健美大道的極應注意。</p>

<h3>美容一得</h3>
<p>— 望</p>
<p>女子在社會上活動了些時候，或在家庭中過事勞作，往往會對自己過分疏忽，她們最寳貴的財產—美麗就被厲害地摧殘，光滑細膩的少女的肌膚開始發現逐漸擴大的毛孔；頭皮乾枯而有垢屑，雙手會失去纖巧，皮色也不爲人所喜歡。補救之道，首先應放棄這種對自已疏忽的態度，倘使覺着到高貴美容館去有不便的話，在各種著名的化粧品之外，尚可利用大自然產品的助力，使美麗重爲你有。</p>
<p>你想要知道何種自然的物質會對你作最大的貢獻吧？倘使你的肌膚是多油的，鷄蛋與牛乳能予你特殊的幫助；鷄蛋的內含淸潔而堅實，牛乳則能阻止毛孔的放大，乳酪能使肌膚柔軟白嫩，酸牛乳更能淸除肌膚上的皰。提到檸檬，它有着收斂與漂白的功能。酵母極富營養性，治皮膚乾燥與橄欖油同具特效。在實行下列各種美容法之前，須將面部洗淸，　不要僅止於下頷，頸和肩也須洗及，再用溫或熱的手巾讓面部舒展，使肌膚能接受嗣後敷抹物的益處。</p>
<p>鷄蛋美容法：於寻常或略微生油的肌膚很有益。把蛋白從蛋黃中分離出來，調之使勻，遍敷面部及頸部，乾後敷蛋黃一層，輸流敷抹，直釗一隻蛋用完，最後一層乾　，用熱面巾拭去，柔和地按摩肌膚，但不要用力擦。</p>
<p>鷄蛋，蜜和杏仁粉美容法：這是使肌膚柔　白嫩的方法，需要一隻蛋的蛋白，與杏仁粉蜂蜜各一匙相調和，將這美好的融合平敷面部，乾後用熱面巾拭去。</p>
<p>酵梅，牛乳，水美容法：此法專門治理皮膚乾燥。用二塊酵梅，加上相等數量的牛乳和水，調成細勻的糊，在敷抹之前，先將淸潔的乳酪塗面，抹去其過度部份，賸下極薄的一層，始將酵梅糊敷於面部和頸部，乾後十分鐘，以熱水洗去。</p>
<p>乳油美容法：用半茶杯乳油，與適宜數量的穀粉調成糊，搽在面部，續加乳油，保潤持濕，的半小時後，用熱面巾抹去，此法能使肌膚柔嫩。</p>
<p>酸乳增進容色法：此法至少能保持容色至數夜之久，常常施行且能淸除酒刺和面皰。祇須在睡前將酸乳搽在面剖，乾後並不抹去，至决晨方將遺留的一層用肥皂和淸水洗去。</p>
<p>檸檬汁收斂法：將一小塊冰包在浸透的薄紗布內，醮一些濾過的檸檬汁，輕輕地摩面及頸，使毛孔收縮，肌膚淸新，患毛孔過大者，可以每晨洗面後如此實行，若檸檬使肌膚感到乾燥，可以單用冰，但不要忘了用紗布包紮，而直接去擦肌膚。</p>
<p>頭髮保護法：髮乾燥或有頭皮屑者，可將橄欖油與蓖蔴油各半置於瓶內，用力搖晃，使之融和。頭髮經梳過相當時候，乃可以此混合油質用指尖擦入頭皮，再以絞乾之熱手巾潤髮，俾使油線鬆展，然後用面巾或絹巾包紮過夜，如此方能使　質充分滲透入於頭皮。</p>
<h3>少女與美容</h3>
<p>— 芳菲</p>
<p>一個少女，當她到達十六歲的芳齡時，她要考慮她的美容問題了，其實卽使是一個十二三歲的少女，也可以開始留竟她的頭髮和眉毛。</p>
<p>在好萊塢有三個小明星，就是佛及妮惠勒，安吉列絲和瓊洛克赫脫，對於她們的美容問題，已經很留心了。佛及妮每天早晨和晚間終要刷她的頭髮，安對於她面上的雀斑十分惱恨，現在她的母親止想法每犬給她用檸檬汁和冷香霜搽用，已經减少了很多，瓊對於她的牙齒，皮膚，和指甲，非常當心。</p>
<p>一個未滿二十歲的少女，在實施美容的時候，不能做得太過分，所以瓊的母親只給她敷用少量的面粉，在脣部敷用一些滋潤的油膏，每天晚上用凡士林塗在睫毛和眉毛上，使牠們有光潤的色彩。她的手楚用優美的霜膏加以保護的，指甲修得相當短，上面用純白的指甲油。她每天要刷牙三次，每星期用霜膏糜擦面部一决，所以她的容貌是相當美觀的？</p>
<h3>關於頭髮生理的常識</h3>
<p>— 漫雲</p>
<p>頭髮在整個容貌上，估、着很重耍的位置，有時候借着頭髮的式樣，可以掩藏面部輪廓的缺點，其實對於頭髮的種種，也是很有研究價値的。美國柯爾格大學敎授賴特博士，曾經在「美國周刋」上，發表下列的村料：</p>
<p>（一）你的頭髮會隔一夜就變白嗎？不會的，雖則有許多物質能彀把頭髮變白，但是要牠自動的變白，決不是立刻可以成爲事實的，因爲頭髮並不是一種有生命的脂肪組織，除非把頭髮根上的色素毀除，老年人的頭髮變白，因爲他們的頭髮是從沒有色素的根上生出來的。</p>
<p>（二）頭髮是不是有生命的？頭髮除了髮根之外，是沒有生命的，所以要使頭髮美觀，應該使髮根存留的頭皮，得到充分的營養。</p>
<p>（三）頭頭髮大槪有多少？　說一個、的頭髮，共有十萬零四千根，但是這是平均數目，當然是有多少的。</p>
<p>（四）時常剃去頭髮，會不會使頭髮生長更速？　不會的，因爲剃的工作，根本不會影響頭髮的生長，但是剃過以後，重生出來，就會顯得更粗，因爲頭髮的尖端，已經被剃去了</p>
<p>（五）每一根頭髮能在頭上留多少年？平均一根頭髮，可以在頭上留四年到七年。頭髮的髮根，是生長在腺胞裏的，如果這腺胞進入了精緻的狀態，那末頭髮就要脫落了，不過當這一根頭髮脫落以後，就會從腺胞裏另外生出一根頭髮來。眼睫毛最容易脫落，大概一根眼睫毛的生命是四個月至五個月。</p>
<p>（六）頭髮的生長，在日間和夜間有沒有分肌？有的，頭髮在日間生長的速度，比夜間快，而且在夏季比冬季生長也來得快。</p>
<p>（七）煩惱是不是要影響到頭髮的生長？煩惱對於整個身體的健康大有影響，間接自然要影響頭髮的生長。</p>
<p>（八）頭髮生長在前額，不是不表明愚笨？不是的，頭髮生得高低一些，對於一個人的智力是毫無關係的。</p>
<h3>實施美容工作的幾個正當步驟</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>根據妊萊塢的美容專家惠斯摩亞（Westmore）多年的研究，制定了下列的美容步驟：</p>
<p>一，用淸潔霜敷在面部，用向上的動作敷去，等待片刻以後，再用棉布把淸潔霜除去，這時候皮膚毛孔裏的汚漬，可以淸除了。</p>
<p>二，用手指蘸美容基本霜，平均的敷在面部，作爲粉底子，（這種霜就是Vanishing　Vream，各種美容品都有不同的名稱，譯者註。）</p>
<p>三，把胭脂，流質的或者是粉質的，敷在面頰　。</p>
<p>四，把眼影膏敷在上眼皮。</p>
<p>五，用適當顏色的而粉，敷在面上，由近耳朶的旁邊向鼻部敷去。在敷用面粉之前，先得審查一下基本霜和胭脂眼影膏是否敷得完美。</p>
<p>六，用小刷子刷去頭髮邊緣上多餘的粉質。</p>
<p>七，然後甩眉筆書眉，照着眉毛的自然形態，略爲加長一些。</p>
<p>八，用眼睫膏塗在眼睫上，上眼睫用向上的方法，下眼睫用向下的姿勢。</p>
<p>九，這時候可以看看胭脂的顏色，是不是和潤而均勻，如果必要的話，可以冉敷上適量的胭脂。</p>
<p>十，用脣膏敷在脣部。</p>
<h3>零碎知識</h3>
<p>— 維敏</p>
<p>美　公共衛生服務社和健康博物院，曾經爲促　身體的健康，提供了下列的材料，對於美容工作方面，也可以作為一種參考，並且也是很有用的常識。</p>
<p>（一）口臭是不能用漱口水去除的　臭在交際塲中實在是一重很大的障礙，這是由身體內部放出的，有時候是因為有腐爛的食屑，存留在口腔或牙縫裏，正當的方法是去除這些食屑，有時候需要牙醫的幫助。</p>
<p>（二）燙髮是不會加深頭髮的密度的　因為每一根頭髮，有她的根，所以決不會受了外界影響而加深頭髮的密度的，</p>

<h3>Unpredictable Changes in the Far East Situation: President Roosevelt Responds Accordingly, Intensifying Steps to Aid Britain Under Discussion; American Reporter Discusses the Chaotic Japanese Political Situation</h3>
<p>Washington - At yesterday's press conference, President Roosevelt was asked about the possibility of an incident occurring in the Far East and whether the United States would maintain the status quo. The President stated that no one could speculate on such matters hours in advance. A reporter then inquired about Roosevelt's recent discussions with Lord Lothian, Chairman of the British Defense Purchasing Commission. Roosevelt replied that he would discuss Lothian's future activities. The reporter further inquired about the nature of Lothian's activities, but the President declined to answer, directing the questioner to inquire directly with Lothian. The President also stated that he had not discussed the possibility of the United States providing further destroyer aid to Britain with Lothian. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - Today's newspapers published remarks by Mr. Fleisher, former editor of the Japan Advertiser, regarding the domestic situation in Japan. He stated that there are significant divisions of opinion in Japan regarding domestic and foreign policy, and that revolutions, riots, and assassinations have occurred repeatedly in recent years. He believes that such actions are likely to continue. On July 5th, Japanese police arrested 38 warriors claiming to be sent by Heaven, because they were plotting to assassinate Admiral Yonai and Count Matsudaira. It is rumored that the mastermind behind this plot was Colonel Hashimoto, who was responsible for shelling the British gunboat "Ladybird" in the Yangtze River in December 1937. There is no possibility of Japan restoring liberalism in the short term. Japanese liberals are currently in hiding. Japanese policy depends on the European war. If Germany wins, Japan will inevitably move towards Nazism. If Britain wins, Japan will adopt a more cautious policy. In July, Konoe ascended to power in a bloodless revolution, but internal conflicts among extremist factions continue to make Konoe's position difficult. The extremist factions are divided into those who support the Emperor as a dictator and those who advocate direct dictatorship with the Emperor as a figurehead. Opinions on foreign policy are even more divided. The Axis alliance is not welcomed by the public, and the government was forced to delay national celebrations until the 2600th anniversary of the founding of the nation, when they were held jointly nationwide. The Konoe government is currently eager to draw the Soviet Union into the alliance, and is therefore negotiating a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. Germany seems to have guaranteed Japan that the Soviet Union will not attack Japan in the event of a conflict in the Pacific, and Japan is eager to see this guarantee realized.

<h3>Japan's Only Elder Statesman, Saionji, Passes Away; Aged 92</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to a semi-official Japanese source, Japan's last elder statesman, Prince Kinmochi Saionji, passed away tonight after several days of illness, at the age of 92. Born into an aristocratic family, he was born in Kyoto in October 1849. In 1867, when the Meiji Restoration restored power from the shogunate, he was not yet 20 years old, but he was already involved in national affairs. He once led troops to suppress the remnants of the shogunate, and was appointed to an important position after the pacification, but he resigned to pursue knowledge and went to France to study law and politics. He returned to Japan in 1880 and founded Meiji University and Women's University, and published a newspaper. In 1882, he accompanied Hirobumi Ito to Europe and the United States to investigate the parliamentary system. In 1885, he was appointed as the Minister to Vienna, and three years later he was transferred to Berlin. In 1894, he joined the cabinet as Minister of Education, and in 1898 he was reappointed as Foreign Minister. In 1900, he succeeded Ito as Acting Prime Minister, and then formed cabinets twice. He served as President of the Seiyukai party from 1903 to 1914, after which he retired and did not actively participate in politics. In 1918, when the Terauchi Cabinet collapsed, he was ordered to form a cabinet, but he declined and recommended Hara Takashi as his replacement. In 1918, when World War I ended, he led the Japanese delegation to the Versailles Peace Conference. The following year, he returned to Japan and was recognized as one of the elder statesmen. Since then, he has retired to his villa in the countryside, offering advice to the government. (Reuters dispatch, [Number missing]th)</p>

<h3>The Dead End of Japanese Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Enumerating the various failures of Japan today, diplomacy must be considered the most prominent. In the three years of war, Japan has changed foreign ministers seven or eight times, and as a result, the cabinet has collapsed two or three times. In terms of policy, almost all lines and diplomatic terms have been tried one by one, but with very little success. The only major achievement has been the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact (now it should be the Quintuple Pact!). Not only has Japan's international standing not improved, but it has deteriorated, entering an unprecedentedly difficult situation. Compared to any wartime country, this is almost unparalleled, and in Japanese history, this can be considered an unprecedented phenomenon. In the past two months, since Konoe's provocative remarks against the United States, he has avoided this issue and remained silent. Matsuoka's Ministry of Foreign Affairs can only soothe American resentment and appease Japanese anxiety. Not only is the so-called "revolutionary diplomacy" a mere empty slogan, but the ambitions and adjustments to the diplomatic lineup that he talked about at the beginning of his tenure have not materialized. Diplomacy with the United States is now close to being stranded, and Kichisaburo Nomura seems to lack the interest and courage to serve as ambassador to the United States. Kensuke Horinouchi, who rushed to Moscow after the Tripartite Pact was signed, has not made any progress in negotiating a non-aggression pact after more than a month. The Tripartite Pact has severed the last bit of friendship between Japan and Britain and the United States. On the other hand, Germany and Italy themselves are of no help to Japan. Are Hungary and Romania, the two allied countries that Germany has pulled in for Japan, merely allies on paper? As for the "resolution of the China Incident" and the Southern Advance policy, which are fundamental national policies of Japan, Matsuoka bears the greatest responsibility, but in reality, neither the peaceful offensive nor economic negotiations have achieved the desired results. The recent Imperial Conference and Privy Council meetings convened by the Japanese government may have made new decisions on this, but it is unlikely that they will fundamentally alleviate the major difficulties. Looking at Matsuoka recently, he is calm and prudent, quite different from when he was actively pursuing the wishes of the military and withdrew from the League of Nations in Geneva. This is his transformation. At the same time, it also shows his bitterness.</p>
<p>Japan's diplomatic difficulties are so great today, but in the past, there was a brilliant page: in both the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, Japan benefited from good diplomatic maneuvering, and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance laid the foundation for Japan's dominance in the Far East. After the Russo-Japanese War, Japan concluded agreements with France and Russia one after another, obtaining an understanding of its sphere of influence in the Asian continent. During World War I, it secretly allied itself with Britain and France, and concluded the Lansing-Ishii Agreement with the United States, thus acquiring several major rights and interests in China and the Pacific. These can all be considered diplomatic victories for Japan. Japan's leap from a semi-colonial status to a first-class power, in addition to the victory of foreign wars and the development of the economy and industry, diplomacy was an important key. Without the achievements of foreign operations, its foreign wars and industrial development would inevitably encounter obstacles, and whether it could quickly become rich and strong is still questionable. However, that golden age has passed. The current Japanese diplomatic lineup may not be comparable to the likes of Okuma, Mutsu, Hayashi, and Kato, but in recent years, the leading figures have included the political wanderer Ugaki, the American friend Nomura, the conservative Arita Sato, the pro-military Matsuoka Shiratori, and the former Prime Minister Hirota, who was somewhere in between. From the army to the navy, from the old faction to the new faction, almost all have been tried one by one. Their lack of achievement is exactly the same. Obviously, the central problem here is not about the strength or weakness of talent.</p>
<p>Although history is not without precedents of diplomacy saving countries from danger, diplomacy is ultimately only one link in the overall political picture, and its application cannot be independent of the entire national destiny. The conditions for Japanese diplomacy today are not necessarily worse than its military, political, and economic conditions, but because its hopes are too extravagant, its failure is also the most miserable. They fantasize that diplomacy can save the military and political situation, but they lack a position, do not speak of good faith, and only engage in speculation and opportunism, with the closeness or distance to the great powers based only on temporary, one-sided interests. Diplomacy like this would be difficult to succeed in any era, but the focus here is not entirely on diplomacy itself, but rather on Japan's entire national policy. Examining the words and actions of the Japanese government over the past ten years, it is not difficult to find that they are disjointed and wavering, and that there are contradictions. The reflection of this in major foreign actions is that they suffer from unclear goals and change their minds. Diplomacy cannot be an exception to this. The fact that Konoe has taken the stage again is already the last gasp of Japanese imperialism. Matsuoka's task is naturally more difficult than before. If he had been calm and pragmatic from the beginning of his tenure, and did not make hasty changes, he might not have been able to help much, but he would not have encountered greater failures than his predecessors. However, he was in a hurry to choose, and vainly tried to take a chance by concluding the Tripartite Pact. At the same time, he was hampered by national strength and circumstances, and could not immediately make a 180-degree turn in national policy to take risks and advance rapidly, but still had to maintain a small, albeit uneasy, attitude. Waiting for extraordinary changes in the international situation to occur, so as to obtain major gains at a small cost. However, his assessment of the international situation, from the European war to his attitude towards China, the United States, and the Soviet Union, is completely contrary to the facts. Although the reaction of Britain and the United States is still somewhat slow, Japan's situation has fallen into a dilemma, turning from side to side with difficulty. This situation is entirely the result of the Japanese authorities' own actions.</p>
<p>Now Japan's southern advance is like an arrow on the string, the war of aggression against China has not yet been settled, relations with Britain and the United States have reached a dead end, and there have been no gains in diplomacy with the Soviet Union or with the Axis powers. This is a desperate situation for Japanese diplomacy, and also a great crisis for its entire national destiny.</p>

<p>Grand Ceremony Held for Romania's Participation in the Pact</p>
<p>Berlin - The ceremony for Romania's formal participation in the Tripartite Pact was held yesterday afternoon in the Yellow Hall of the New Chancellery. The founding of the Tripartite Pact on September 27 also took place in this hall. The hall was decorated with fresh flowers, which added to the solemnity of the ceremony. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop first entered the hall, followed by Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu, Foreign Minister Sturdza, Japanese Ambassador Kurusu, Italian Ambassador Buti, and Hungarian Minister Sztójay. At that time, about 200 members of the diplomatic corps from the four countries concerned and representatives of the press from various countries had already gathered in the hall. The Romanian Prime Minister wore a general's uniform, and the Foreign Minister wore an Iron Guard green shirt. They sat to the right of the German Foreign Minister, with the Japanese and Italian Ambassadors and the Hungarian Minister to his left. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop then announced in simple terms that the Romanian government wished to join the Tripartite Pact and had received the consent of the three countries. Special Envoy Schmidt then immediately read the full text of the pact. At this time, the Romanian Prime Minister, the German Foreign Minister, and the Japanese and Italian Ambassadors successively signed the pact, which took a long time because each person had to sign 16 times, namely, four copies of the pact in German, Italian, Japanese, and Romanian. At this time, photographers and filmmakers were extremely busy. The Romanian Prime Minister then gave a speech in German on behalf of the Romanian government, stating that Romania recognizes the Tripartite Pact as an effective tool for reorganizing Europe and the world, and pledging that Romania will do its utmost to ensure that the goals set by the pact are achieved. The German Foreign Minister then delivered a speech on behalf of the German, Italian, and Japanese governments, welcoming Romania's accession and expressing that today's ceremony is a further step towards the final victory of the justice advocated by the signatory countries. After Ribbentrop finished his speech, he shook hands with the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Italian and Japanese Ambassadors, and the Hungarian Minister to congratulate them.

<p>German and Italian Newspapers Promote the Increased Strength of the Axis Powers</p>
<p>Berlin - The "German Foreign Policy Correspondence" published an article yesterday welcoming Romania's accession to the Tripartite Pact, stating that Romania had previously become a victim of British conspiracies, but now has changed its course and resumed cooperation with European countries. Under the leadership of Antonescu, Romania has regained its interests in Europe. The Axis powers will be able to guarantee Romania's legitimate status. The new European order cannot be achieved at the roundtable conference. The failure of Geneva can serve as a lesson. It requires a period of struggle to be realized. Britain's starvation blockade policy on the continent has created a sense of solidarity in Europe. The Tripartite Pact has had the effect of mutual dependence among European nations and will unite to deal with the enemies of the continent. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian people have long known that Romania will join the Tripartite Pact, so the news did not cause excitement among the people here, but everyone was happy because Italy often regards Romania as one of its Latin sisters. Italian newspapers all described this matter on the front page, believing that this is a victory for the Axis powers. A famous Italian journalist commented in "Italian News" that the policies of the Axis powers and the Tripartite Pact have now expanded their influence to the shores of the Black Sea. On the contrary, Britain's position has become increasingly isolated. For example, the British government's protests to Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Japan have not received a response. According to Hungarian newspapers, Bulgaria will also join the Tripartite Pact. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - German newspapers this morning all carried accounts of the four major political events of last week, namely, the visits of the Italian and Spanish Foreign Ministers to Berlin and the successive accessions of Hungary and Romania to the Tripartite Pact. The "German General Report" stated that within these ten days, two more European countries have joined the Tripartite Alliance. Romania's adherence to the Tripartite Pact is not only a symbol of purging Romania's past politics, but also a sign of Romania's determination to help build a new European order. After Romania joined the Tripartite Pact, it has now accepted the basic belief of European peace. The "Berlin Local Daily" stated that the major nations of the world are now undergoing a large-scale reorganization process, and no one can deny the fact that a new era is gradually approaching. In the future, all countries can obtain security that they could not obtain before. All those who have safely reached new lands after this revolutionary crisis are confident in the future. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German Foreign Ministry mouthpiece, the "German General Report," stated that Slovakia's participation in the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact is clear evidence of supporting the new order. The Slovak people, under the leadership of Hlinka, stubbornly fought against the oppressive democratic government that was not Czech. Now Slovakia has become independent with the help of Germany and joined the Tripartite Pact, expressing its determination to cooperate in building Europe. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Istanbul - Turkish authorities told reporters that the declaration of martial law in various parts of Turkey is not due to any special event, but is part of the ordinary national defense measures under the current circumstances. Turkey is still determined to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war unless attacked or threatened. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Sofia - Sofia is very surprised by Turkey's declaration of martial law in the Thracian province and the straits area. Political circles in Sofia stated that Bulgaria has not taken any measures that would cause Turkey to declare martial law. Relations between the two countries have been very friendly since the signing of the treaty in 1925. Therefore, Bulgaria has also had to take necessary precautions on the border, but believes that Turkey's measures will not lead to serious consequences. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>

<h3>Greek Troops Advance in Rain and Snow, Intensifying Siege of Italian Army's Left Flank; Rumor of Italian Army Abandoning Pogradec</h3>
<p>Athens: The Greek High Command announced today that Greek troops along the 120-mile front on the Greek-Albanian border continued to advance last night despite rain and snow. It is claimed that the Greek army's pincer movement is poised to encircle the northern and southern ends of the Italian army's shattered line. While the bad weather minimized air force activity, Greek troops encircling the Italian army's left flank took the opportunity to tighten their encirclement. It is rumored that the Italian army has withdrawn a portion of its forces from Santi Quaranta, a major port in Albania. It is also claimed that Argyrokastron is about to surrender. Two divisions of the Italian army, numbering 30,000, failed to defend Argyrokastron and retreated north, reportedly falling into the jaws of the Greek army's pincer movement. The Greek army is now redoubling its efforts to annihilate this besieged Italian garrison. Greek snipers and search parties are currently pressing the Italian army into a state of siege. However, the Greek communique admits that Italian warships shelled the Greek island of Samos yesterday, reportedly causing minor damage. It is reported that the Greek army is continuing its advance along the entire front, capturing large quantities of military supplies for its own use. Meanwhile, according to news reaching here today, a mutiny broke out among Albanian troops near Larisa, resulting in the deaths of two Italian officers and thirty soldiers, after which they joined the Greek army. It is also reported that General Papagos, accompanied by his staff, triumphantly entered Korçë, which had been captured by the Greek army. (24th International Telegram)</p>
<p>Athens: The Greek army's fierce advance in the general offensive is increasing, causing new threats to the northern and southern ends of the Italian army's fragmented line in Albania this morning. It is rumored that the Italian army is now withdrawing from Santi Quaranta, an important seaport in southern Albania. The loss of this city will isolate the Italian forces in the south by sea. It is rumored that two Italian divisions, totaling 30,000 men, are surrounded near Argyrokastron, cutting off their retreat to the north. Argyrokastron itself, the main base of Italian power in Epirus, is in even greater danger. Authoritative sources here claim that the city's fall is only a matter of time. It is reported that the Greek army has launched a fierce hand-to-hand battle from Delvinë, while also dispatching troops across the Libohovë to monitor the flanks of Argyrokastron, thus placing the city in imminent danger. Yesterday evening, an Italian naval aircraft bombed several districts of Corfu, but there were no casualties. (24th International Telegram)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday's "Exchange Telegraph" Athens dispatch stated that the Italian army is rumored to have abandoned Pogradec in Kopania to form a line of defense south of Elbasan along the Kamby River to resist the Greek army. (24th United Press)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: According to unconfirmed Greek sources here yesterday, Greek troops have entered Pogradec in Albania. This news has not been confirmed by United Press border sources. (24th United Press)</p>
<p>Athens: A local communique declared that the Greek island of Samos in the Aegean Sea was shelled by four Italian destroyers last night, totaling more than seventy rounds, but resulting in no damage whatsoever. It is believed that the ships sailed from Leros. Corfu was also bombed by Italian aircraft and strafed with machine-gun fire, fortunately without damage or casualties. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>Italian Army Constructs New Positions Northwest of Korçë</p>
<p>Belgrade: According to local reports, there were no major battles on the Greek-Italian front yesterday. The Italian army has constructed new positions northwest and west of Korçë, making it difficult for the Greek army. It is expected that the Italian army will soon launch a counter-offensive. The Italian army's right flank has concentrated a large force and is poised to attack. There was heavy snow and thick fog on the front on Friday, preventing both sides' air forces from operating. (24th Huitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Budapest: News reaching here this morning stated that the Greek army's general advance northward after the fall of Korçë was temporarily halted by the Italian army last night. The news also stated that large reinforcements of Italian troops are now arriving in the northern Albanian theater of war, and a major Italian offensive is expected next week. (24th International Telegram)</p>
<p>Rome: According to the Italian Army Headquarters, the Italian army on the Greek front is continuing to move according to plan. Greek attempts to hinder this movement have been unsuccessful. A British aircraft was shot down and destroyed near Tallaria on our coast. Italian aircraft encountered British aircraft over Malta, shooting down six British aircraft. Italian aircraft bombed Mika Bar and Halfa airfield, dropping multiple bombs. All Italian aircraft returned. Italian aircraft bombed a British ship near the island of Samos in the Aegean Sea, causing it to catch fire. Italian light warships struck a British speedboat and mine-laying boat. All Italian ships returned safely. On the East African front, a British tank column attacked Ilgalo in Kenya and was repulsed. Italian fighter planes shot down a reconnaissance plane over Kisumu, and the pilot was captured. British aircraft dropped bombs near Ta Kamir without causing damage. British aircraft launched a night raid on Turin and Reggio Calabria, dropping flares, incendiary bombs, and explosive bombs, without casualties or damage. (24th Huitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Two Italian Divisions Routed Across the Devol River</p>
<p>Athens: The Italian army, which was jointly bombed by Greek and British aircraft and trapped by Greek cavalry, was driven out of the Kamia Plateau behind Korçë yesterday. The troops commanded by Italian Army Ministry official General Sosso have reportedly not launched a counter-offensive against the advancing Greek army. It is reported that the Greek army is proceeding with caution because the Italian army is using tanks and armored vehicles to cover the soldiers' retreat. It is also reported that the Italian army is retreating in an orderly manner and has now withdrawn across the Devol River, retreating further towards Pogradec. According to various sources, while the Italian rearguard was still crossing the bridge over the Devol River, British bombers bombed the bridge. However, the Italian army had laid explosives on the bridge, preparing to destroy it immediately after the troops had crossed. When the British bombed the bridge with explosives, numerous explosions occurred, completely destroying the bridge. After the bridge was destroyed, the famous Greek Evzone unit, along with Greek cavalry, bravely advanced across the frozen river on horseback. At the time the bridge was blown up, there were several Italian tanks on the bridge, which were all destroyed. The Greek army also discovered a large amount of bridge repair materials in the captured Italian cargo trucks. This material can now be used by the Greek army to repair the Devol River bridge and continue to pursue the Italian army. Greek armored vehicles had crossed the river within a few hours, and Greek soldiers were using Italian anti-aircraft guns to protect the bridge from Italian counter-attacks. It is reported that of the five Italian divisions that previously held the Korçë area, two divisions have been routed by the Greek army in battles to resist the Greek army, hold passes, and defend mountain villages, and were scattered by Greek riflemen. It is reported that the Italian troops in the mountain passes included the famous Bersaglieri and Alpini units. According to the Greek army, the Albanian villages in the highlands have been burned by the Italian army, presumably in retaliation for the Albanian rebellion. (24th United Press)</p>
<p>Greek King Issues Order Commending Troops for Valiant Combat</p>

<p>British Military Supplies Continuously Shipped into Greece by Land, Sea, and Air</p>
<p>Cairo: A Reuters correspondent reports that Britain is continuously shipping military supplies into Greece by land, sea, and air. The reporter saw giant aircraft flying to Greece in the Mediterranean area yesterday, loaded with direct-fire guns, bombs, and ammunition. These planes landed to refuel and took off again after a few minutes. After reaching Greece, they quickly unloaded their cargo and transferred it to the front lines for use by the Greek army. The reporter also saw a heavily guarded air convoy heading for Greece, so that no planes in the convoy were lost en route. The first items to enter Korçë were British cannons, and British planes, mixed with Greek planes, flew over the city as the Greek army entered the city and pursued the fleeing Italian troops. The Greek army is now quickly learning the techniques of using new British cannons and is quite capable of handling them with ease. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>Bulgaria Denies Troop Concentration on Border</p>

<p>Sofia: The Bulgarian official news agency issued the following statement yesterday: "The reports from a certain country's news agency that Bulgarian troops are concentrating on the Turkish-Greek border are denied by the authorities today.

<h3>Soviet Government Replaces Ambassador to Germany; New Ambassador Dekanozov Accompanied Molotov on Visit to Berlin</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR has appointed Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Dekanozov as Ambassador to Germany. The previous Ambassador to Germany, Shkvartsev, has been dismissed. It is noted that Dekanozov previously accompanied Molotov to Germany. (24th TASS)</p>
<p>Moscow: A few hours after Romania officially joined the Axis powers of Italy, Germany, and Japan, the Soviet Union announced last night that it was recalling its current ambassador to Germany, Shkvartsev, and replacing him with Deputy Foreign Commissar Dekanozov. The official reason for this unexpected replacement has not been stated, but foreign diplomatic circles in Moscow believe that this move, occurring on the same day that Romania followed Hungary in joining the totalitarian bloc, is noteworthy because Romania and Hungary's accession to the Axis has extended the Axis' power directly to the Black Sea, which is an important rear gateway for the Soviet Union. Turkey and Bulgaria seem to have felt a sense of threat, and the European war situation may become chaotic. The aforementioned diplomatic circles are eager to know whether the replacement of the Soviet ambassador is intended to prevent this trend. It is pointed out that the Soviet Union has repeatedly solemnly declared that the Soviet Union's policy is to limit the scope of the war and keep it as far away from the Soviet border as possible, and before the ambassador was replaced, the German claim that Hungary's accession to the Axis was fully approved and cooperated by the Soviet Union was denied by the Soviet official news agency TASS.

<h3>Admiral Leahy Appointed U.S. Ambassador to France</h3>
<p>Washington: The appointment of Admiral Leahy as the U.S. Ambassador to the Vichy government has been announced by the authorities. It was previously believed here that President Roosevelt's appointment of an ambassador to France indicated that he was more concerned about the head of the Vichy government, Marshal Pétain, than the Vichy government itself. It was generally known that President Roosevelt's selection of personnel for this position would not be limited to experienced diplomats, which is now even more certain. "The Washington Post" commented on this matter, saying that President Roosevelt is evidently trying to strengthen Marshal Pétain's hand in order to resist Nazi efforts to drag France into the "New European Order." Washington insiders generally view Admiral Leahy as a person who has the President's complete trust. It is generally felt that the situation in the Mediterranean is now extremely urgent, and the final destination of the French fleet is still undecided. Therefore, it is particularly appropriate to appoint a senior naval officer as ambassador to France. (24th Reuters)</p>
<h3>U.S. and Britain Reach Agreement to Lease Western Hemisphere Territories; United States Permitted to Construct Military Bases; Another Step in Solid Cooperation Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Washington: The Navy Department announced yesterday that the United States and Great Britain have mutually agreed on the locations of British territories in the Western Hemisphere that will be leased to the United States for military bases. The Navy Department also stated that the agreement includes Bermuda, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Antigua, St. Lucia, British Guiana, and Newfoundland, but does not mention Trinidad. It is reported that in Bermuda, the United States will establish an army airfield on Long Bird Island and a naval airfield, naval base, and garrison area on St. David's Island and nearby islands. In addition, the United States will establish an explosives storage depot between St. David's Island and Haddington Island. Britain will also allow the United States to freely build bridges and construct all the necessary conditions for bases in these locations. In the Bahamas, the United States will use the vicinity of Abaco Bay and Mayaguana Island. The United States' interests in Jamaica will include the following seven points: (1) Permission for U.S. ships to dock at Portland Bight; (2) Land area including Goat Island and nearby bays, with an area of 33 square miles; (3) Establishment of defensive fortifications at Portland Bight and Portland Island; (4) Designation of 100 acres of open space near Williamsfield for rest and hospital use; (5) Designation of one square mile of land five miles south of the Vega Canal in May Pen as an emergency auxiliary landing area; (6) The right to develop resources and use the British Royal Naval Dockyard; (7) The joint use of airfields in the area by both the United States and Britain.

<h3>British Air Force Crosses Channel, Heavily Damages German Air Bases; Multiple Dogfights Occur Over the Channel; German and Italian Aircraft Attempts to Attack London Fail</h3>
<p>London: The British Air Ministry announced today that last night and early this morning, the British Air Force dealt another major blow to Axis military targets, including German invasion bases in the coastal areas of Europe, which contrasted sharply with the minor air raids by the German Air Force last night. Since yesterday morning, after multiple dogfights between British and German aircraft over the Channel, several squadrons of German bombers attacked Liverpool and cities on the northeast coast yesterday evening, but were repelled by intense German anti-aircraft fire. It is claimed that British fighter squadrons attacked White Cliffs three times, but were all dispersed and driven away by the British Air Force. After dusk, Hitler's air force only launched sporadic air raids. It is believed that the recent arrival of Italian pilots has made it difficult for them to coordinate with the German Air Force, which has greatly hindered German air operations. (24th International Telegram)</p>
<p>London: Enemy aircraft repeatedly attempted to infiltrate London yesterday, but only one squadron of enemy aircraft flew very high over London in three air raids. An Air Ministry communique stated that houses in southern London and a town at the mouth of the Thames were slightly damaged, but the number of casualties was very small. The Messerschmitt Me 109 had not been seen for almost a week, but it flew over again yesterday, but was hindered by land-based artillery fire. Anti-aircraft guns defeated the second wave of attacking enemy aircraft and shot down at least one enemy aircraft in the third wave of attacks, which appeared to be a Junkers bomber. The British Air Force finally drove back the enemy aircraft. Two Dornier seaplanes were shot down by British aircraft off the French coast. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>London: The British Air Force's targets for its intense attacks on Friday night and Saturday morning were the Merignac airfield near Bordeaux, because it is the concentration point for German aircraft attacking British shipping in the Atlantic. According to the Air Ministry communique, the airfield's buildings and ground aircraft sustained heavy damage. Flames rose hundreds of feet after the airfield was attacked. British pilots could see their bombs falling. Barracks and aircraft hangars along the coast between Brest and Lorient were also bombed that night, as British aircraft continued to attack the bases used by the Germans for their attacks. Another part of the British Air Force attacked targets in the Ruhr region. The night raid covered a wide area. All British planes returned except for one. During daylight yesterday, Central Aircraft attacked enemy airfields at Schiphol and Bergen in the Netherlands, as well as factories in the Ruhr region of Germany. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>Berlin: A large number of British aircraft attempted to attack Berlin last night, but failed to break through the German air defenses. British aircraft flew towards Berlin from all directions and at different altitudes, and at one point launched a group attack to try to break through the air defenses, but were stopped by searchlights and anti-aircraft guns. Many people in the villages around Berlin did not enter the shelters and watched the battle on the streets. It is claimed that people were seen jumping with parachutes. No bombs fell near Berlin. The British aircraft's bombing of Potsdam and Rauen was also unsuccessful. (24th Huitong Telegram)</p>
<p>Berlin: Two hundred and fifty German aircraft attacked Southampton, a major port on the southern coast of England, last night, dropping 300 tons of explosive bombs and 12,000 incendiary bombs on the harbor, docks, and warehouses, bombing throughout the night and setting fires everywhere. While German aircraft were concentrated on bombing Southampton, a small number of aircraft also dropped bombs on London, Liverpool, and Bristol. The Glandson Ordnance Factory was bombed and caught fire. (24th Huitong Telegram)</p>
<p>London: British communique states that on Saturday night and Sunday morning, British bombers were very active as the weather improved. In addition to bombing the freight yards and stations in Berlin and Leipzig, they also heavily attacked the largest port in the German interior, the port of Duisburg-Ruhrort, the canal docks in Boloyes, and the railroad junction in Dortges. In addition, the Krupp factory in Essen and several airfields were also heavily bombed by British aircraft. A squadron of British bombers also attacked targets in Turin, Italy. Three British planes were lost. (24th Reuters)</p>
<p>London: Last night and early this morning, British bombers heavily attacked northern Italy, Germany, and German-occupied areas. Berlin was heavily bombed again, and several targets were destroyed. However, German officials said that all British aircraft were forced back by heavy anti-aircraft fire and were unable to reach the center of Berlin. The Italian cities attacked included Turin and Reggio Calabria. Italian officials said that British aircraft dropped bombs, Molotov bread baskets, and flares. (24th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Italian Port of Taranto Attacked Again</h3>
<p>Cairo: Last night, a communique here disclosed that the important Italian seaport of Taranto was attacked again by the British Air Force. It is said that a large fire started south of the western pier of the port, and there was also a violent explosion near the main railway station, illuminating the entire town. A fire and explosion also occurred near the oil refinery. All British aircraft returned safely to their bases. (24th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Marseille Bombed</h3>
<p>Vichy: An aircraft fleet of unknown nationality bombed Marseille at midnight, dropping multiple bombs. Officials here believe that the aircraft were British. Four people were killed and three were injured at the time of the bombing, and several fires broke out. Details are still unknown. French anti-aircraft batteries also opened fire. (24th Huitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Vichy: French State Councillor Laval arrived here this afternoon from Paris to investigate the bombing of Marseille last night. A total of twenty bombs were dropped last night, two of which did not explode, making it possible to trace their origin. It is generally suspected that the bombs were dropped by British aircraft. Political figures here believe that although the leaflets found after the bombing of Marseille are in Italian, they are largely the same as the leaflets dropped by British aircraft in Italy. The French authorities consider this matter quite serious. (24th Huitong Telegram)</p>
<h3>Pope to Make Peace Appeal</h3>
<p>Vatican City: Pope Pius XII completed his final important peace appeal last night, so that he could hold mass at St. Peter's Basilica today to pray for the soldiers who have died in the European war. His appeal will be released at this time. According to Church communications sources, the Pope will praise the United States' efforts for peace in his speech. This speech was originally intended to be religious in nature and avoid political involvement. (24th United Press)</p>
<h3>England Urgently Hopes for US Financial Aid: British Ambassador States After Returning to His Post</h3>
<p>Washington – British Ambassador Lord Lothian recently returned to England to confer with various leaders of his home government. He arrived back here today, and when reporters asked him about the Johnson Act, which the United States is considering amending or canceling, the British Ambassador replied that such a suggestion would not be appropriate for the British side to make. As for how Britain will continue to pay for the military supplies provided by the United States, it will be resolved within the next six months. It was also suggested that Britain liquidate its gold and bonds to cover expenses in the US exceeding $100,000. (Reuter's dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>New York – British Ambassador to the United States, Lothian, returned here from England today and told reporters that Britain is increasingly feeling the inadequacy of its financial resources. All cash and foreign securities will soon be exhausted, and the financial difficulties in the budget for the coming year will be very serious. Therefore, next year will be a difficult year for the country, not only requiring various war supplies such as munitions and ships, but perhaps also financial aid. American assistance would be appreciated. Britain does not have any feelings that American aid is insufficient. The British people hold a very high belief in final victory without any doubt. The bombing of London has only strengthened national unity. The British feel that they will certainly not be defeated by Hitler, but will defeat Hitler. Lothian will immediately depart for Washington, and after returning there, he will expedite matters regarding increased US assistance to Britain. (Reuter's dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>New York – The American Institute of Public Opinion announced yesterday that 45% of the American people favor the United States changing the Johnson Act's loan restrictions to England. The question used in the survey was: "The Johnson Act stipulates that the United States will no longer loan money to any country that does not pay interest on previous debts from the European war. Do you support changing this law to allow Britain to borrow money from the United States?" (United Press dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Queen Mother Travels to Italy</h3>
<p>Rome – Queen Helen, the Queen Mother of Romania and mother of King Michael, has resided abroad for many years. She only returned to the Romanian capital in mid-September of this year, after the abdication of former King Carol II. Now, she has decided to travel to Italy and departed today via the southern capital, arriving at the port of Venice. The Duchess of Imas Polito met her at the station, and they immediately went to Florence for a short stay. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>A Painful History of the European War (3): Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy</h3>
<p>(3) Reynaud, Exhausted by Coping</p>
<p>After Reynaud returned to Paris from London, Parliament was about to reconvene. Besides announcing the intensification of the blockade, there was not enough time to take any other measures. In reality, the news of intensifying the blockade did not make much of an impression, and even he himself did not have much confidence in it. Last winter, when Reynaud was still Minister of Finance, he stood between the Minister of Blockade and the Minister of Armaments, laughing and saying that he hoped the war would achieve its victorious goal sooner, relying less on the first friend (referring to the blockade) and more on the second friend (referring to armaments). Well-informed French people generally did not trust the blockade very much, and the parliamentarians, during their recess, also heard unfavorable reactions to the government's declarations from their constituents. Therefore, they sent representatives to Daladier, asking him when he would "carry out the execution of the Reynaud government." They thought the sooner the better. However, Daladier already had a clear plan and knew that Reynaud was about to fall, so he did not want to push him down himself. In short, in this critical moment of survival, the farcical drama in the French Parliament was still being performed with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>In the days just before the direct clash, Reynaud secretly told his subordinates that he would feel very lucky if the number of abstentions in the Chamber of Deputies did not exceed sixty votes. At the same time, the leader of the Socialist Party, Léon Blum, had it spread that Reynaud was not a proponent of a major offensive, contrary to the rumors spread by the opposition party. It was also learned from other sources that Reynaud, after meeting with the military leaders, knew that they had no such plans for the time being. In the first few days after the war began, people generally believed that a long-term war could make Germany yield, and this idea was prevalent in London as well. Former British Secretary of State for War, Hore-Belisha, declared, "Can we win safely?"</p>
<p>Daladier knew that there were gaps in French defenses and that the statistics submitted to the parliamentary committees contained many errors. From September of last year to March of this year, he sometimes felt deeply pessimistic; however, he allowed France to believe that "we can defeat the enemy without much effort," and therefore, he became increasingly popular. When Daladier resigned, one parliamentarian even shouted in panic that the war led by Reynaud was no longer a "war of a democratic country."</p>
<p>Since France had no grand plans, it only returned to the path of intensifying the blockade, and on April 7, laid mines off the coast of Norway to prevent iron ore from being transported to Germany. Germany responded by invading Denmark and Norway on April 9. At this point, the motion to overthrow the French government was no longer an issue; Germany's initiative had saved Reynaud's cabinet's life. However, the "waiting" government or the commanders of the three armed forces were able to plan and devise strategies to prevent national disasters. Their time, however, was lost from that point onward.</p>
<p>No matter how the French government responded to an enemy taking the initiative, it was always one step behind and ineffective. The meeting held at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 7:00 AM on April 9 was a foreshadowing. Two days later, Weygand set off for Syria, and the Prime Minister gave flowers to this commander who had not been given the supreme command of the country to see him off. At that time, the partnership between Daladier and Gamelin remained unshaken.</p>
<p>From April 9 onward, the situation took a sharp turn for the worse. France's fate no longer depended on long-term mistakes; it would now be a total reckoning that would affect the entire country. Weygand was appointed Commander-in-Chief with difficulty on May 19, but the situation was already beyond saving, and even with extraordinary abilities, he could not turn the tide.</p>
<p>The Commander-in-Chief and Minister of War, who had been responsible for France's military affairs for four years, only took responsibility when the crisis was imminent, while Prime Minister Reynaud, who had only been in office for a few weeks, had to bear not only his own sins but also the blame for several former Prime Ministers.</p>
<p>In two weeks, things changed so quickly and unexpectedly that Reynaud was often confused and indecisive. How to deal with the French fleet was a clear example. He was probably so confused at this time that he could not adapt to the changes. His response to events could not emulate Napoleon or Clemenceau's personal appearances and improvisations, but instead, he hid in his residence, drafting speeches, preparing to broadcast them on the radio. Even if every word was moving, it would not help the overall situation. Moreover, fate destined him to announce news of defeat every time he stood before the microphone, making the French people regard him as a "bad omen" and afraid to listen to his broadcast speeches. In short, Reynaud's indecisiveness was already very obvious, as can be seen from simultaneously giving General Petain and Baudouin two important positions, which showed his confusion.</p>
<p>French law stipulates very clearly that it is the government's responsibility to preside over the war situation, and the commander is only responsible for executing military affairs. Therefore, the French army must be commanded by civilian officials in peacetime and cannot determine the country's military policy. The democratic country initially established this principle, originally imitating the precedents of enlightened monarchs of past dynasties. How could anyone have known that the relationship between the military and the government would change with the times and become completely different from the original intention of the legislation? The government granted the generals the power to act expediently, thinking that it could protect the country's peace, but did not know that it was abandoning its responsibilities and deceiving itself.</p>
<p>In the French Third Republic, the relationship between the military and politicians had never been very smooth. Before 1914, countless factional disputes in Parliament arose from anti-militarism. Army commanders were often the targets of attacks and investigations, and they had to be constantly vigilant, which made those in charge very wary.</p>
<p>After 1914, the French victorious soldiers naturally enjoyed great prestige, and the saying "the General Staff is never wrong" spread everywhere. The military and political circles had long been incompatible, and at this time, the military's power rose, and they gradually became dictatorial. The admired victors dominated the entire country. The old guard remained entrenched, and the newcomers had no way to rise. Those who advocated new weapons and new tactics were all subservient to others. If a major or lieutenant colonel talked about the power of tanks in the War of Flandres, a group of generals would just smile and dismiss it as nothing more than reading an ideal novel.</p>
<p>How could anyone know that the military situation was vastly different from the past and that one could not stubbornly refuse to change? France's first mistake was not knowing that "the occupation of territory" could not be like Napoleon's use of troops, sparing no expense to fight on enemy territory. This is what is called "defending against the enemy outside the borders is better than defending against the enemy inside the borders." Because France took a purely defensive position, it gradually developed a mystical concept of believing in the Maginot Line, reducing the spirit of seizing the initiative.</p>
<p>In fact, military offensive and defensive strategies must adapt to changing circumstances. How can one cling to old ways? In 1914 to 1915, the French army lacked heavy artillery. If it had taken the offensive at that time, it would have made a big mistake. Of course, it had to hold firm. Later, those who advocated a defensive position often used the excuse that France lacked manpower and could not take a large-scale offensive war. But in the modern era of war, which relies on material resources rather than manpower, is this statement credible? If France had ten or fifteen mechanized reserve divisions, even if Germany's population was twice that of France, who could say that the French army was unable to stop the German offensive?

<h3>Lack of Libido in Men Is Not Always a Pathological Condition</h3>
<p>– Co-authored by Yao Chongpei, MD, USA, and Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Beijing Road and Sichuan Road Intersection</p>
<p>(Time) 10 AM to 6 PM, closed on Sundays</p>
<p>One often hears people say: lack of libido in men is a pathological condition. Even more people say: a decrease in libido in men can indicate that his life is coming to an end! The purpose of this sensational fallacy is nothing more than to encourage people to indulge in licentiousness, and the harm it causes is greater than knives and guns killing people.</p>
<p>Our argument: lack of libido in men is not always a pathological condition. Because for accomplished men after marriage, the desire for career often outweighs love. Or, because their mental cultivation deepens gradually, or because their spouses are dissatisfied with their intentions, they gradually develop a sense of indifference towards sexual desire. But this does not mean that they are weak and incompetent. Because when there is a beautiful view and a good night, when they are in high spirits; or when the couple is happy and acts playfully, they will definitely show their vitality and grandeur, both to delight their own minds and to comfort the tender and ardent affection hidden deep in the heart of their beautiful spouse. Therefore, this kind of man not only does not hinder love, but also helps love to be eternally long-lived!</p>
<p>However, there is a type of man who suffers from early masturbation, nocturnal emission, early marriage, and excessive indulgence, causing significant damage to the secretions of the gonads (i.e., semen). They suffer from premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, scattered energy, thin semen leading to infertility, kidney deficiency, brain weakness, and neurasthenia, etc. This type of man often has two different manifestations: one is that they cannot find pleasure in sexual life, feel tired of life, and fall into a bitter state of pessimism, so their libido is weak. This is undoubtedly a pathological condition. The other is that their bodies are deficient, but their desires are strong. During the long winter nights, they frequently want to try, arousing their wives' excitement. However, in real sexual life, they only flash briefly or cannot perform at all. How can this not arouse their wives' hatred? It is often heard that couples become estranged, love is broken, and various family tragedies such as elopement and divorce occur. It is also countless that the symptoms worsen, leading to premature aging, short life, and early death!</p>
<p>If there are the above-mentioned symptoms, then it cannot be confused with lack of libido. One must seek thorough treatment as soon as possible to avoid serious consequences! The method of treatment: According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking gonadotropin preparations made from healthy animals is the most effective treatment for this. Therefore, this agent was invented earliest, supervised most carefully, contains precious ingredients, contains cruciform crystals of gonadal hormone, pituitary crystals, as well as deer antler essence, vitamins, and many other ingredients. Therefore, its efficacy is certain, and its replenishing power is great, unmatched by any similar preparations. After taking it, semen can be produced, kidneys can be nourished, the brain can be strengthened, and blood circulation can be promoted in one day and night. Continuous use will further promote development, nourish nerves, and regulate metabolism. The above-mentioned symptoms will inevitably be cured invisibly in a short period, and energy can be further increased. Elderly people often take it to prolong life, rejuvenate and return to youth. However, those suffering from nocturnal emission must also take the highly effective medicine for treating nocturnal emission "Ximitu's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" (available in Wuzhou Taihe Sino-Western Huaying Sino-English and other large pharmacies) to consolidate the sperm gate and stop the leakage, then the source will be opened and the outflow will be restricted, and the effect will be even faster.</p>
<p>Patient Li Jianfei, from Hunan Province, age 30, married for 10 years, suffered from nocturnal emission, brain weakness, kidney deficiency, lack of children, neurasthenia, etc. Although he had repeatedly taken over-the-counter medicines on the market, they had little effect. Recently, the symptoms worsened, and a friend urged him to go to Hong Kong for work, but he was blocked by illness and was extremely anxious! (Above is self-reported) Last month, he came to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After a detailed examination of his symptoms, we found that they matched what he said, and we instructed him to purchase two dozen "Gonadotrophin" and one dozen "Ximitu's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" and take them concurrently, and to apply electrotherapy every other day. It has only been a month, and now all his diseases have suddenly disappeared, his face is rosy, his energy is abundant, and the love of his couple is even stronger. We have heard that he will take his family to Hong Kong to take up a new position, then in the warm and beautiful southern country, another sweet couple will be added!</p>

<h3>Remedies for Imperfect Breasts</h3>
<p>– Yao Chongpei, MD, USA</p>
<p>Forehead carved with tram tracks, breasts like deflated purses.</p>
<p>Such women may dress up, but men will shake their heads. Don't underestimate a woman's pair of breasts! It really has ten thousand points of magic and precious value. To be honest, if a woman's breasts are higher and more elastic, it can not only fully set off her plump chest and graceful waist, forming a beautiful curve that makes people intoxicated with love. At the same time, due to the soundness of her own ovarian function and the vigor of her metabolism, her temperament is gentle and supple, her skin is crystal clear and white, and her cheeks are red and charming. Such a girl, not only in her virgin era - it can also be said in her study era, due to her extraordinary intelligence and character, can be among the best, be the most outstanding student, and be loved by teachers, elders, relatives, and friends. Even if she marries later, relying on these beautiful conditions, wouldn't her husband obey her every command and treat her like a living treasure?</p>
<p>But the facts tell us that such women are also the most difficult to find. The only main reason is that women have various physiological differences, such as menstruation and pregnancy. Therefore, there are often women in their prime who have many tram tracks engraved on their foreheads, rough skin, and are skinny, and especially embarrassing is a pair of breasts, like two dry, deflated purses. Although such women are fully covered with powder, parading in the streets, there are few who are not sneered at by men? If you want to remedy it, the most practical and reliable way is to quickly take the gonadotropin ovarian preparation "Gonadotrophin" for women. The main reason why the breasts are sagging and lose their fitness is that the gonadal ovarian function is destroyed by symptoms such as irregular menstruation, white discharge, weak multiparity, and malnutrition. After taking "Gonadotrophin" for women, the ovarian function can be cultivated, metabolism can be strengthened, menstruation can be regulated, and the palace can be warmed and the discharge can be stopped in one day and night. If you continue to take it, it can not only cure various symptoms, but also make the breasts high, the hips plump, and the complexion rosy, staying young forever.</p>
<h3>Young Men with Nocturnal Emission Enjoy a Difficult Life of Happiness</h3>
<p>– Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Everyone knows that nocturnal emission is a symbol of weakness. If young people suffering from nocturnal emission continue to delay treatment, the degree of weakness will inevitably increase rapidly. The most terrible thing is the brain weakness and kidney deficiency caused by nocturnal emission!</p>
<p>The semen in a man's body is like the lubricating oil in a machine, which can lubricate the functions of various parts and make them active. The desire for sexual love is due to the activity of semen (i.e., gonadal secretions). Therefore, they enthusiastically choose a spouse, talk about love, get married, have children, and form a family... opening up the brilliant flowers of life and enjoying the infinite happiness of life! If a man suffers from kidney deficiency due to untreated nocturnal emission, then premature ejaculation and impotence will inevitably follow; or nocturnal emission will weaken the development function. Although he is an adult, his sexual organs are still thin, like a child; or the semen is thin, leading to infertility after a long marriage. All these symptoms make it difficult to enjoy the joy of newlyweds, let alone the happiness of life. Countless young people in the world have lost love and joy because of this and have fallen into the tragic situation of the world? Those who suffer from brain weakness and insomnia due to nocturnal emission, which affects their studies and careers, and regret it in their old age, or even die young, are also everywhere!</p>
<p>The most effective treatment for nocturnal emission is to take "Ximitu's Semen-Consolidating Tablets." This medicine can indeed consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves. After taking it, it can achieve the effect of sleeping and stopping nocturnal emission on the same night. However, patients must recognize the words "Ximitu..." when purchasing it to avoid being confused by miscellaneous medicines and delaying the treatment. Those who have already had the above-mentioned symptoms due to nocturnal emission must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Gonadotrophin" made from healthy animals to cultivate and replenish the brain, kidneys, semen, blood, and nerves. Taking it continuously for a month can increase body weight, strengthen energy, and eliminate all diseases invisibly. In addition to taking the above-mentioned good medicines, if patients can come to our clinic to receive new therapies such as electrotherapy injections, we can guarantee a cure.</p>

<h3>Fundamentally Resolve the Food Problem of This City: National Rice Must Be Freely Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<h3>Previous Consultations a Month Ago Have Not Yielded Results</h3>
<h3>Relying on Foreign Rice to Make a Living Is Still Not the Best Policy</h3>
<h3>Coal Stocks Are Sufficient to Meet Demand This Winter; No Need to Panic</h3>
<p>According to well-informed sources yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council consulted with the Japanese authorities in this city more than a month ago to allow domestic rice and wheat to be freely transported to Shanghai from the occupied areas, but no substantial results were achieved. Therefore, there seems to be no end in sight for citizens having to pay high prices to buy foreign rice. The only way to fundamentally solve Shanghai's rice problem is for domestic rice to be transported here steadily without obstruction. Currently, the amount of domestic rice being transported into Shanghai is negligible, only accounting for one-tenth of what Chinese residents need.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants Speculate and Raise Prices Artificially</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, there were rumors that the reserves of foreign rice in this city were running low. Fortunately, a large amount was shipped from Vietnam, which prevented a crisis from occurring. Currently, the selling price of foreign rice has not yet fallen due to exchange rate differences, transportation costs, and insurance costs. According to well-informed sources, a few days ago, there were rumors that war had broken out between Vietnam and Thailand, causing turmoil in the Shanghai rice market. It was also rumored that the Vietnamese authorities might soon ban rice from being shipped out of Saigon. Rice merchants seized the opportunity to profit, causing rice prices to rise.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Supply Is Extremely Abundant</p>
<p>Subsequently, both Siam and Vietnam have been shipping large quantities of rice to Shanghai, and the rumors have subsided. More than 7,500 tons of Australian wheat have also arrived in Shanghai and are being unloaded. Shipping circles say that Siam, Saigon, and Hong Kong will soon continue to ship large quantities of rice and wheat. Last week, the Jinan [steamer] carried 7,153 bags of rice, and the Yuezhou [steamer] carried 4,435 bags of rice, both arriving in Shanghai. A French ship also carried 14,200 bags of rice and wheat. And the Lina [steamer], which arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday, also unloaded 7,500 tons of Australian wheat. The current reserves are sufficient, and there is no possibility of interruption.</p>
<p>Coal Stocks Are Sufficient; No Need to Panic</p>
<p>However, most citizens are concerned about the future of their food supply due to the current situation and the lack of clarity in the market conditions. According to an official from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Survey Department, the city has sufficient stocks of Hongji coal, so there is no need to panic about the future supply of coal. It is unreasonable for coal balls to increase in price. The price of coal should not change much in the next few months, and the prices of imported food are only slightly affected by the European war.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army: Relief for the Hidden Poor</h3>
<h3>Small Loans Can Be Obtained with Shop Guarantees</h3>
<h3>Shelter Can Be Established Next Month</h3>
<p>The beggar shelter, which is being actively prepared, is expected to be established next month. Thousands of beggars in this city will be able to find a place to call home. However, there is no concrete relief plan for the hidden poor who are difficult to openly beg. It is reported that the Salvation Army has specifically established a small loan relief program to address this issue. Any legitimate merchants who have fallen on hard times and have shop guarantees can apply to the Army for relief. After investigation by the Army, loans can be granted. This loan does not charge any interest. Borrowers use this money for small-scale operations. If it is used for improper purposes, the guarantor will be held accountable. There have already been more than 700 people applying for this relief loan.</p>
<h3>American Red Cross Sends 20,000 Bags of Rice and Wheat to Shanghai to Relieve the Poor, Distributed by the American Red Cross in Shanghai, Also Collecting a Large Quantity of Medicines to be Shipped to Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>Refugees in Shanghai After the War Gather: They are facing difficulties with food and clothing, have no means of livelihood, and are displaced and impoverished, which is truly pitiful. In view of this, the American Red Cross, taking advantage of the return to the United States last November of its Director-General and Director-General of the China Relief Commission, Mr. Baker, extensively promoted and appealed to the American people to generously provide relief. It is now known that Mr. Baker has returned from his leave and arrived in Chongqing via Mandalay Road in late last month, fully presiding over China's relief work to benefit the poor. His spirit is commendable.</p>
<p>Large Shipment of Rice and Wheat Arrives in Shanghai Last Night</p>
<p>The American Red Cross Board, at the urging of Mr. Baker, decided to be responsible for soliciting various relief supplies in the United States and transporting them to China. At 6:00 PM yesterday, the American ship "Collinsworth" arrived in Shanghai from the United States, carrying 20,000 bags of rice and wheat, which were handed over to the American Red Cross in Shanghai for distribution to various refugee organizations. Mr. De, the Director-General of the YMCA, also participated in the matter. The livelihood of 15,000 refugees in this city will be guaranteed as a result, and a serious problem will not occur for the time being.</p>
<p>Spare No Effort in Relieving Refugees</p>
<p>According to reports, the American Red Cross was originally an advisory body for the American side at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, and was once closed. Later, it was reorganized into the American Red Cross in Shanghai, a branch of the American headquarters. Since its establishment, it has spared no effort in relieving Chinese refugees. From October 1937 to March of this year, the American Red Cross remitted 800,000 yuan to Shanghai for relief donations. In December 1937, the refugee problem in Shanghai was extremely serious. At that time, there were 18 shelters, accommodating 137,000 refugees, and 75,000 people were wandering the streets without a place to live. In addition, about 665,000 people fled from the occupied areas to Shanghai and lived in the homes of relatives and friends, but their lives were difficult. Fortunately, they were able to maintain their lives thanks to the continuous assistance of the American Red Cross. In August of this year, the American Red Cross remitted another US$10,000 to Chongqing to relieve civilians who were victims of air raids.</p>
<p>Additional Medicines to be Shipped Soon</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned rice, wheat, and donations, the American Red Cross is also collecting a large quantity of medicines in the United States to be shipped to China, including 15 million tablets of quinine, 20 million tablets of aspirin, 1 million tablets of sulfanilamide, 20,000 pounds of heavy magnesium carbonate, 30,000 pounds of boric acid, 2,000 pounds of anesthetics, 5 million yards of gauze, and 40,000 pounds of cotton. The medicines can be used by 2,500 patients for six months, and are scheduled to arrive in Rangoon in the near future, and then be transferred to Chongqing via Mandalay Road, and then distributed to various places. Currently, the American Red Cross in this city is also trying to ship 900,000 tablets of quinine from Java to Shanghai for use.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Winter Clothing Donation Approaching at the End of the Month, All Sectors Urged to Donate as Soon as Possible, Little Time Remaining, Do Not Miss the Opportunity to Serve the Country, Schools and Organizations Should Especially Take Responsibility</h3>
<p>The winter clothing donation campaign in this city has been actively promoted to all sectors by the Donation and慰勞 (comforting) Committee after it pledged 500,000 yuan to the Chongqing General Association. The goal is to raise 1 million yuan in Shanghai. Since the campaign began, all citizens have deeply understood the great righteousness and enthusiastically donated. As of the end of last month, the committee has verified the donation reports from various organizations and the used receipt stubs.</p>
<p>It is confirmed that various trade associations have remitted approximately 400,000 yuan, schools have remitted more than 70,000 yuan, and organizations and institutions have remitted more than 50,000 yuan, totaling more than 900,000 yuan in national currency. In view of the frequent good news from the front lines, various sectors are very excited and have redoubled their efforts in the donation work. In order to fulfill the original intention and raise the full amount, in addition to reporting to the Chongqing General Association, the deadline has been extended by one month, so that all sectors can contribute as much as possible during the extension period and continue to shoulder this work to complete the glorious task. As the extension deadline is approaching, the committee is making a final appeal for donations to all sectors, and hopes that trade associations, schools, organizations, etc. that have not participated in the winter donation campaign will rise up and promote donations in the short term, and do not miss the opportunity for citizens to serve the country. It is also hoped that those in charge of various organizations will take responsibility and participate immediately, and there should be no excuses or cowardly evasions. Furthermore, those trade associations and organizations that have the strength but have not made efforts to effectively promote donations have submitted only a very small amount of donations to perfunctorily fulfill their responsibilities. During this final period, it is hoped that they will continue to make total efforts to effectively promote donations to reach the amount stipulated by the committee. The committee will close the campaign at the end of this month and will handle the complete closure. It is hoped that all those who have not participated and all organizations that have raised a certain amount should donate as much as possible as soon as possible, submit the donations on time, and complete the great mission of the era.</p>
<h3>British War Fund Continues to Receive Large Sums Last Week</h3>
<p>The British Central War Fund received 75,000 yuan in donations last week. The total amount has reached 1,404,198.74 yuan. Among the donations last week, 14,000 yuan was from the sale of flowers on European War Peace Memorial Day. The stock exchange donated 10,000 yuan, the China Textile Company donated 5,000 yuan, and two rubber companies donated a total of 7,000 yuan. Other private donations were all above 1,000 or 2,000 yuan, so the total amount is indeed quite considerable. In addition, the fund received a donation of 40 pounds from the British expatriate community in Nanjing last week, totaling 22,465 pounds, 8 shillings, and 9 pence.</p>
<h3>Frugality and Nation-Building Movement Advances, Reaching 50 Million Yuan, A Strong Manifestation of Self-Reliance, Completing the Great Cause of Nation-Building in Hardship</h3>
<p>Since the authorities advocated the frugality and nation-building savings movement, and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau issued national construction savings bonds, compatriots at home and abroad have responded enthusiastically and purchased them. It is learned that due to the active promotion over the past year, as of the anniversary of the establishment of the National Savings Association on November 10 of this year, the total amount of savings bonds purchased by compatriots across the country, including overseas Chinese, has reached 50 million yuan. The savings deposits received by various banks and the savings and remittances bureau over the past year have also increased by more than double compared to the previous year. Currently, this movement, due to the widespread establishment of savings promotion networks and agencies for collecting savings funds, has spread to provinces, cities, and counties across the country, and even to remote villages. Overseas Chinese compatriots who purchase savings bonds by mail, since the Joint Treasury revised the flexible measures, the procedures for purchasing by mail have become more secure and convenient. People in the international community have unanimously praised the Chinese authorities for advocating frugality and nation-building, and the enthusiastic response of the people across the country, believing that the strong manifestation of self-reliance of the Chinese nation will surely enable them to complete the great cause of nation-building in the midst of arduous warfare.</p>
<h3>New and Old Provincial Notes in Various Provinces All in General Circulation in Shanghai, Newly Issued Provincial Notes Allowed to be Used in the Same Way as National Currency, Jiangxi Yumin Bank Notes Can be Applied for Exchange</h3>
<p>Since the promulgation of the measures for managing the issuance of one-yuan notes and subsidiary notes by provincial banks or local banks in various provinces, provincial banks or local banks have complied with the orders of the Ministry of Finance to issue one-yuan notes and subsidiary notes. As for the banknotes issued in the past, they have all been taken over by the Issuing Reserve Management Committee. The newly issued one-yuan notes and subsidiary notes are limited to circulation within the province. However, provincial banks or local banks mutually exchange them and use them in the same way as the legal tender of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Central Bank. The reserve fund is 60% in cash and 40% in guaranteed reserve.</p>
<p>Mutual Exchange Between Banks</p>
<p>The reporter of New Voice News learned from the banking community yesterday that provincial banks or local banks are: (1) Zhejiang is Zhejiang Local Bank, (2) Jiangsu is Jiangsu Bank and Jiangsu Farmers Bank, (3) Jiangxi is Jiangxi Yumin Bank, (4) Fujian is Fujian Provincial Bank, (5) Anhui is Anhui Local Bank. All of the above banks have issued banknotes and small denomination notes, and have all complied with the order to be taken over by the Issuing Reserve Committee. Therefore, the reserve funds for the banknotes previously issued by various banks have been transferred to the Issuing Reserve Committee. From now on, the newly issued banknotes are limited to one-yuan notes and subsidiary notes of one dime and five dimes, and will be handled in accordance with the newly promulgated measures. Various banks have also agreed to follow the previous method of mutual exchange. Although the banknotes are limited to circulation within the province, all banks agree to mutually exchange them.</p>
<p>General Circulation in Shanghai</p>
<p>Now, provincial banks and local banks have drafted operation plans and proposed banknote amounts and types, and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for approval to issue new banknotes. The Central Trust Bureau will print them on behalf of the banks. After the printing is completed, they will be sent to the Issuing Reserve Management Committee for safekeeping by the designated custodian bank. The issuers will deposit the reserve fund with the custodian bank and collect the banknotes for issuance. Because the new measures stipulate that they are limited to circulation within the province, various banks are doing their utmost to prevent them from flowing into other provinces. Regarding the one-yuan notes and subsidiary notes of the Jiangsu Farmers Bank and the Zhejiang Local Bank in the Shanghai concession area, they have been in general circulation in the past, so they can still be used in general circulation in the future. Those who hold Jiangxi Yumin Bank notes, etc., can apply to the Shanghai branches or offices of the respective banks for exchange into legal tender.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Reconsider Telephone Rate Increase, Tendency to Reduce it Appropriately</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company recently requested a rate increase from the Shanghai Municipal Council because it intends to install 16,000 new telephone users, and the cost of purchasing equipment is extremely high. Although the proposed rate increase plan has not yet reached the decision stage, the extent of the rate increase has increased across the board, causing strong opposition from residents throughout the city. According to the Ping Ming News reporter, the Shanghai Municipal Council will hold a board meeting at 4:00 PM on Wednesday to discuss the issue. According to well-informed sources, the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities, in view of the excessive telephone rate increase and public outcry, are reconsidering the proposed rate increase plan and have a tendency to reduce it appropriately. However, it is still necessary to wait for the French Municipal Council to reply before discussing it together. It is not yet known whether the French Municipal Council's reply can be delivered before the board meeting on Wednesday. According to the opinions of the Chinese side, the reason for the telephone company's decision to increase rates is due to the excessive cost of installing 16,000 new telephones. Therefore, this burden should be added to the new telephone users. The Shanghai Municipal Council should also consider this point from the fundamental level, which is the fair way to go. Moreover, telephone is a public utility, and public interests should be taken into account, and the burden on public use should not be increased excessively.</p>

<h3>Draft of Real Estate Leasing Regulations Formulated by the French Concession Housing Rent Research Association</h3>
<p>The French Concession Housing Rent Research Committee has drafted a chapter on the leasing and transfer of real estate within the concession, as reported in previous newspapers. According to the Continental News, the French Concession Public Works Bureau has promulgated regulations on the leasing and transfer of houses to prevent the malpractices of collecting small rents and forcing the sale of furniture at high prices. According to major foreign real estate companies in the city, they have never charged small rents, so they are not affected by these regulations. Those who will be hit are many Chinese real estate companies and second landlords. An executive of a French real estate company said that he has heard of the collection of small rents, but it has nothing to do with the company. The reporter recently asked</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau</p>
<p>Deputy Director and Head of the Information Office, Mr. Nash, about the Shanghai Municipal Council following the example of the company and trying to ban the collection of small rents. Nash replied that he could not comment until the Director-General and President of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, returned from his short vacation. Mr. Fessenden is scheduled to return to work on Monday, and may issue a statement on the matter the next day. It is also heard that the</p>
<p>French Municipal Council</p>
<p>will evaluate rents with reference to the current situation and study the expenses of the industry, such as the increase in land taxes, the increase in repair costs, the ratio of Chinese and foreign rents, and the purchasing power of the currency to determine the standard. The original text of the draft chapter is recorded below for reference:</p>

<h3>Market Price of Government Bonds Rising Steadily, Creditworthiness Increasingly Solid, Establishment of Sino-American Loan Encouraging, 96 Government Bonds Soar in Opening Price</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance made every effort to maintain creditworthiness, the principal and interest of government bonds issued after the war were repaid on schedule and never overdue. The unified reconstruction and growth bonds issued earlier were discounted and paid by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and Central Bank, which was deeply trusted by bondholders. In addition, good news was frequently reported from various places, and the Sino-American loan was established. Therefore, the Shanghai securities grey market was encouraged, and prices soared. Various banks and overseas Chinese absorbed the bonds in unison, creating a new record since August 13, which is sufficient to show the strengthening of the government's position and the consolidation of the legal tender's credit, and is also a good phenomenon in the financial dynamics of Shanghai. It can also enable Shanghai's floating capital to gradually enter the right track. At the same time, due to the improvement in the bond market, the number of subscribers for the government bonds issued after the war is increasing day by day. The first issue of the military supplies and construction bonds issued this year has been fully subscribed. The 96 government bonds, which have been suspended for a long time, were opened for auction last Friday, and the price rose by eight cents on Saturday. The consolidation of the credit of national bonds can be seen.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement and Corruption, Three Defendants Sentenced</h3>
<p>Lin Jingshui, manager of Liyuan Firm, Room 102, No. 126 Hankou Road, recently had two batches of goods imported and entrusted Maolong Trading Firm at No. 7A The Bund to transport and declare them. When the goods arrived, Lin Jingshui, manager of Julong, notified Pan that the customs had deemed that the prices of the two batches of goods were underestimated and that additional customs duties were required, totaling more than 2,202 yuan. Pan did not suspect anything and paid the full amount. However, after inquiring with the customs, it was found that the matter of additional customs duties mentioned by Lin was completely fictitious and was obviously a deliberate fraud. Therefore, he reported to the General Police Station, which ordered detective Han Shoushan to arrest Lin Jingshui and escort him to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Peng Qixin prosecuted him for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Code. After questioning by Judge Dai, Lin confessed to his crime, but the civil lawsuit was settled with Pan. The court then announced the verdict, sentencing Lin Jingshui to six months' imprisonment with a three-year reprieve.</p>
<p>Zhou Bing'ao, Zhou Bing'ao from Ningbo, lives at No. 11 Tongding Lane, Sichuan Road. He was an accountant at the Yingming Photo Studio at No. 311 Nanjing Road. Recently, he took advantage of his position to embezzle public funds of 2,148.5 yuan. Manager Zhou Yanqing investigated and reported to the General Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest Zhou Bing'ao and escort him to the First Special Court for questioning. The case was previously referred to the First Special Court for custody. The case was previously referred to the First Special Court for custody. On the previous day, Judge Xiao opened the court for further questioning. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi said that the case had been verified, and the civil lawsuit between the original and defendant parties had been mediated.

After Cao discovered this, he reported to the General Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest Zhang Jundai and escort him to the First Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted him according to law. After questioning by President Feng, Zhang Jundai was sentenced to six months' imprisonment with a two-year reprieve in court.</p>

<h3>Weather Report</h3>

Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this city was a maximum of 63.1 and a minimum of 47.8. On the same day last year, the maximum was 64.4 and the minimum was 47.3.</p>
<h3>Humorous Elements in "The Great Dictator"</h3>
<p>Is this a case of being insufficient before the world? Or did that cannon, by chance, suffer a slight ailment? That X-7418-R shell did go out, but it didn't reach Paris. Not far from its hometown, it lay on the battlefield like a fat pig. Neither exploding nor detonating, it was completely silent.</p>
<p>The Turkish military officer, seeing this scene, was greatly astonished. So he ordered someone to investigate the reason why the shell didn't explode. The Major ordered the Captain, the Captain ordered the Platoon Leader, the Platoon Leader ordered the Corporal. The Corporal, already a minimal figure in the army, like sesame seeds or green beans on the road, was unwilling to risk this danger and passed the order on to the Private, Hynkel. Chaplin, being the lowest of the low, seeing that there was no one "behind" him to pass the order to, had to bite the bullet and check why the shell didn't explode!</p>
<p>Hynkel hesitated to move forward, neither able to advance nor daring to retreat. He inched closer to the shell, one step at a time. But that mischievous shell not only started spitting fire but also began spinning around him. This frightened him immensely, almost causing his soul to leave his body, making him truly "spin in circles." The audience, seeing this, felt a little worried for him, but mostly, they were laughing so hard their stomachs hurt. However, heaven never bars all roads. That big shell, in the blink of an eye, with a "whoosh," disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Hynkel, as represented by Chaplin, did many awkward things in the army. At that time, anti-aircraft guns were crudely made, with the barrel pointing straight up. Attached to the gun body was a chair for the person observing enemy planes. Hynkel also once served as an anti-aircraft gunner, hanging in mid-air, observing enemy planes through the periscope, aiming the gun. His expression was beyond any painter's ability to capture.</p>
<p>Hynkel was a soft-hearted and nervous person, unable to withstand living under fire. His ears were so badly affected by the explosions that he developed a kind of mental illness. He forgot everything completely, unable even to speak. Later, he was discharged from the army and returned to his hometown to recover. After regaining his health, Tomainia was ruled by a dictator. With no way to make a living, he became a barber to support himself.</p>
<p>At this time, Chaplin on the screen lived in the Jewish quarter, returning to his civilian identity. His three treasures—a bowler hat, a bamboo cane, and large, wide-toed, broken leather shoes—were all back on his person. Of course, he also had his signature clothes to wear: a short, narrow jacket, two balloon-like trousers, a stiff collar, a black tie, a small vest... wrapping Chaplin's entire body. He couldn't sit still, couldn't stand steady, raised his cane, raised his hat, constantly busy. When he walked, the heels of his large leather shoes landed first, dragging along, his feet pointing outward, swaying back and forth, as if he had no bones, only a copper wire holding him up from the inside...</p>
<p>This trademark and style of his has been the same since 1914, until today. Anyone who has seen "Shoulder Arms," "The Pilgrim," "The Gold Rush," and "City Lights," can close their eyes, and this "precious living figure" will immediately appear before them. There's no need to describe it further here.</p>
<p>Hynkel's lover, Hannah, played by Chaplin's wife, Paulette Goddard, doesn't find Hynkel's attire and behavior strange at all. Instead, she loves him wholeheartedly. When he is driven out by the dictator, he begins to court her. Chaplin's shy and embarrassed demeanor is also memorable.</p>
<p>Hynkel, while barbering, mistakenly uses white paint on the faces of stormtroopers. This is like patting a fly on a tiger's head, offending them in a way that deserves death. From then on, that wonderful and unpredictable story unfolds.</p>
<p>After the barber is mistaken for the dictator, he meets Napaloni in the palace. One real, one fake, one spirited and lively, one understanding inside, intricately complicated, confusing everyone. When these two dictators are getting their hair cut in the palace, they refuse to yield to each other because the problem of whose chair should be raised higher proves impossible to solve.</p>
<p>The fake dictator appears to be making himself into a dictator on the surface, but inside he is extremely pained, extremely conflicted. In several scenes, he raises his right hand to salute, but his face is full of sorrow, almost about to cry.</p>
<p>Chaplin spent two years of effort making "The Great Dictator," determined not to create a shoddy product. He personally participated in everything from writing the script, directing, and scoring the music to designing the sets. Several of the great scenes in the film are unlike anything Chaplin had ever done in his previous films. Besides the first scene of the European War, as mentioned earlier, there are many other places where a lot of money was spent on making props and sets.</p>
<p>That new-style Tomainian cannon was specially made for this film. It measures 100 feet long, weighs 6,500 pounds, cost $15,000 U.S. dollars, and can fire shells just like a real cannon. It is the most expensive prop in "The Great Dictator."</p>
<p>The dictator's residence, the grand office, welcoming foreign heads of state like Napaloni, the lively scene at the train station, the welcoming crowds on both sides of the road, the grand banquet, the lavish and extravagant ballroom, and so on, are all lavish sets built regardless of cost. Who says that clowns don't need to spend a lot of money to act in comedies? Chaplin has truly boosted the morale of comedians everywhere.</p>
<p>Chaplin also had some twists and turns in naming this film "The Great Dictator," and in the end, he considered it a successful work. Initially, he wanted to name it "The Dictator," but 台難斯氏 had already used this name before, and the 百拉蒙 Company held the copyright to the name. If Chaplin wanted to use this name again, he would have to pay 百拉蒙 twenty-five thousand dollars. He managed to find a solution: he added the word "Great" above "Dictator" to differentiate it. Afterwards, he said to others, "I call my film "The Great Dictator"—completely free!"</p>
<p>Before "The Great Dictator" was released, Chaplin invited a reporter from the New York Times to visit. When the film showed Chaplin, who played the dictator, stepping into a 廠式 car, an officer ran over and saluted him. Then the camera panned out, and at least a hundred thousand people appeared on the screen, welcoming and shouting in a great scene.</p>
<p>The reporter asked Chaplin, "Where did you get this scene?"</p>
<p>Chaplin was very clever. He said, "Where did we get this scene? Guess where we got it from? It was filmed in Germany—my hired Fifth Column secretly filmed it in Germany. Hitler is not only the character I play. He's also paying for the production of my film. It saved me a lot of money. Isn't that strange?" (The End)</p>
<p>Sexual Health</p>
<h3>Love Problems and Marriage Safety Issues</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Regarding the study of marriage problems, the British 爱凯 has strongly advocated marriage based on love, condemning all marriages not based on love as immoral, and insisting that the establishment of a husband and wife relationship must be based on love in order to create a complete family; but on the other hand, he still advocates free marriage; if their love cools, they may separate and seek new love, which also shows that love cannot guarantee its perpetuity, it also shows that repeated love is inevitable, and it also shows the reason for the occurrence of female adultery.</p>
<p>Couples formed through mutual love seem to be able to be complete, but perhaps due to abnormal sexual organs, her sexual desire cannot be satisfied; or after living together for a long time, everyone is in contact with each other every day, exposing each other's shortcomings, causing spiritual dissatisfaction, then love gradually cools down, and cracks occur in the family, and then "varied sexual demands" occur, causing love to decrease day by day, resulting in tragedies such as divorce. The saying "Marriage is the tomb of love" is indeed correct. The best method of marriage, instead of marriage based on love, is to strive to cherish sexual health after marriage. What is sexual health? It is that the foundation of marriage is not only built on love, but also takes into account the actual issue of sexual desire. Academic achievement, temperament, and status can be used as conditions for varied love, but if after marriage, a sexual flaw is found in either party, then the initial love cannot be maintained permanently, and great disappointment will inevitably occur, leading to love for other people; therefore, love without sexual health as a backing rarely leads to a long life together, resulting in either divorce or adultery. However, the remedy for this kind of harm must use the latest science to be effective, because the dissipation of sexual energy is caused by damage to the pineal gland, which governs sexual desire, so the correct treatment method must be to take the German authentic testicular essence preparation for men "补体康". The ingredients of "补体康" are extracted from the testicles and ovaries of animals. It has an astonishing effect on premature aging, kidney deficiency, and inability to perform sexual acts. It can supplement the brain, kidneys, and blood. Elderly people who take it can rejuvenate. The female version can regulate menstruation and promote fertility. This has been clinically proven to be effective for a long time and is trusted by Chinese and foreign doctors. It can be said to be a specific medicine for kidney deficiency.</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emission Is Most Tempted</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>The motives of young people who commit self-pollution are mostly tempted by the outside world. They often go to public places or like to go to singing and dancing stages. Once they are fascinated by sights and sounds, they use self-pollution as a remedy, which is not uncommon. It is important to know that self-pollution is the greatest bad habit that damages brainpower and sexual function, and because there is no object, it can be done with a single thought, so it is easy to become an addiction. As it is committed for a long time, its harm gradually deepens. In recent years, people in the medical community have long been loudly appealing and warning young people not to consider self-pollution as feasible, but those who speak earnestly are ignored, and those who commit it increase day by day, which is considered a major threat to the health of young people.</p>
<p>The earliest symptom of self-pollution is nocturnal emission. Semen is the foundation of human health. If emissions are too frequent, hundreds of diseases will occur, which can lead to neurasthenia, incomplete development, weak brain and kidney deficiency. For the sake of health, treatment should be sought quickly. This can be treated with the German "耐而斯遗精片," which can stop it, but self-pollution must be stopped, and health preservation must be strictly observed, then the effectiveness of the medicine will be greater. Usually, do more work that is beneficial to your career, do not idle, and do not go to places where men and women are mixed. This is also a necessary way to prevent self-pollution.</p>
<h3>The Great Realization of Gonorrhea Treatment</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Wu Kechun</p>
<p>People who suffer from gonorrhea always feel at a loss when choosing medicine, because once it is treated incorrectly, there will be endless troubles. Acute cases turn into chronic cases, and chronic cases then develop complications such as orchitis and prostatitis, which can lead to infertility and physical disability, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<p>In the field of gonorrhea treatment, after the transmembranous sterilization therapy was declared a failure, and the general chemical therapies were mostly unworthy of their name, and there were no valuable achievements for our clinical use, we buried ourselves in research, not knowing how much effort was spent. Fortunately, 利耳珂禾氏 and 林那塞氏 discovered the improved chemical therapy of gonorrhea: autogenous immune therapy. This method is used to inject into the human body to increase the patient's anti-gonococcal toxin, so that a large number of blood cells are produced in the blood to annihilate the gonorrhea hidden inside. This method has been recognized by doctors around the world. When German Doctor 彼德 came out, he went a step further and used the most precise scientific methods to make the gonorrhea oral medicine "克淋侬". After repeated animal experiments, it was confirmed that this medicine is a specific medicine for gonorrhea and has no side effects.</p>
<p>Because this method can increase the human body's anti-gonococcal toxin and white blood cells, this gonorrhea oral medicine can absolutely cure all acute and chronic gonorrhea in men and women, and there will be no adverse effects. The discovery of this "克淋侬" medicine is the realization of the ideal effect in gonorrhea treatment. In terms of external medicine, men can use "抗淋水" as a suppository, so that no matter how deep or shallow the gonorrhea is hidden, it can be completely eliminated and solved permanently.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>— Doctor Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Easily Leads to Neurasthenia</p>
<p>Neurasthenia caused by gonorrhea has many symptoms. Gonorrhea is most likely to damage reproductive function. Prostatitis, which we most often encounter, is often likely to turn sexual nerves into the possibility of sexual neurasthenia. Therefore, those who suffer from prostatitis must pay attention to this. From my 20 years of experience, people who are usually neurotic are particularly prone to this disease. Although the prostate gland is not very swollen, if palpation is performed, the patient will feel unbearable pain.</p>
<p>The fundamental and rapid treatment of gonorrhea must have a scientific basis, otherwise, no matter how well you say or write that it can be cured in three to five days, the facts are always the facts. Local surgery in general does not seem to have any effect, because the speed of gonorrhea's escape and its ubiquity are like mercury spilling on the ground, penetrating every pore, so to ask for a complete treatment method for gonorrhea, you must first make a comprehensive and precise plan to be effective. Here, based on my long experience, German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy are the transcendent gonorrhea therapies in physical therapy, and the latest chemical preparation in gonorrhea oral medicine has an anti-gonococcal phage effect, which has the great power to surround and kill gonorrhea that is good at escaping. Stubborn gonorrhea can be fundamentally solved in a short period of time. It can also restore sexual nerves to their original health, which is unmatched by any gonorrhea therapy. Also treats syphilis, scrofula, chancroid, and sexual neurasthenia. Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients are sent for consultation every day, and each number only costs 50 cents.</p>
<h3>Secret to Coughing and Stopping Coughs</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Regardless of traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine, cough is a difficult disease to treat, so lung disease is more common than any infectious disease, and its mortality rate is also alarming. Therefore, ordinary people should not think that a cold and cough is a minor illness and not treat it. If unfortunately, the cough becomes lung disease due to lack of treatment, then the patient should not be pessimistic. In fact, lung disease is not as terrible as generally thought by doctors. As long as you take care of yourself and treat it properly, there is nothing mysterious about it. According to my experience, "补肺拿尔" medicine has a special effect on relieving coughs and treating lungs. No matter if the disease is in the second or third stage with hemoptysis, taking this can absolutely cure it. However, during the recovery period, you should be quiet and avoid exertion, and eat more nutritious foods, so the disease will be easier to cure. This is the condition for the inevitable cure of pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<h3>Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education Announces Measures to Subsidize Food for Teachers and Students of National Schools, Approved by the Executive Yuan Meeting</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Air Dispatch) Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education announced the following measures on November 13 regarding subsidies for food for teachers and students of national schools:</p>
<p>With the rise of the war and schools in the war zone suspended, the central government, in order to continue educational undertakings and maintain the studies of young people out of school in the war zone, on the one hand ordered colleges and universities to move to the rear to hold classes, and on the other hand established national secondary schools and Zhongshan secondary school classes to accommodate secondary school students. Furthermore, because poor students in the war zone have had their economic sources cut off, special loan measures have been formulated to prevent the majority of poor youth from dropping out of school. The original loan amount was set at 7-8 yuan per month, but due to different prices in various places, appropriate reductions were made as appropriate. In September of this year, the highest amount has been increased to 18 yuan, and this month it has been increased to 25 yuan. Recently, President Chiang and Vice President Kong have been concerned about the living conditions of teachers and students of various schools, and the Ministry of Education has stipulated subsidy measures. Food rice for teachers and students of national schools will be subsidized if the market price exceeds 50 yuan per stone. The food loan for poor students in the war zone and the food expenses for students of national normal schools will be calculated at 2.1 dou per person per month. If the market price of food rice in various places exceeds 50 yuan per market stone, the excess amount of the food loan will be reported by each school to the Ministry for approval of the standard, and then the actual expenditure will be reported to the Executive Yuan for additional appropriation. As for self-funded students of national schools, if the monthly food cost per person exceeds 18 yuan, if the family is unable to bear the excess amount within the approved standard of the food cost for loan students in the same area, the parents may request the school to issue a subsidized food loan. After the school examines and reports to the Ministry for approval, it will discretionarily lend the full amount or half of the excess amount for relief. These measures have been approved and implemented by the Executive Yuan, and the current food problem in various schools can be solved accordingly. In recent years, students in various schools have strived to reduce food expenses, and nutrition has often been insufficient, but they have been able to encourage themselves, strive to learn, and increase their sense of responsibility since the war. In the future, it is hoped that students of various schools will be kind to the government's love for youth, maintain the utmost sincerity of education, and deeply remember the hard lives of soldiers on the front line and the people in the rear, and work even harder to study hard and live up to expectations. It is also hoped that teachers and staff of various schools will be aware of the difficulties of the times, maintain the spirit of serving education in the past, continue to train and guide young people, and shoulder the responsibility of resisting the construction of the country. The future of education truly relies on this.</p>

<h3>The Circulation and Endorsement of Zhuang Tickets</h3>
<p>— Nutao</p>
<p>1.  Overview</p>
<p>Zhuang tickets are promissory notes issued by money shops, promising a fixed amount, and unconditionally guaranteed for payment by the issuing money shop. They are a type of economic credit security, referred to by scholars as promissory securities. According to the classification in the Bills of Exchange Law, Zhuang tickets should be legally considered "promissory notes." However, Zhuang tickets originated with money shops and have a long history, dating back before the promulgation and implementation of the Bills of Exchange Law (October 30, 1929). Therefore, the industrial and commercial sectors continue to use the old name (Zhuang ticket) and have not changed the name to promissory note according to legal provisions. (However, in other ports, habits vary; for example, in Hankou, tickets under 100 yuan are called Zhuang tickets, while those over 100 yuan are called exchange tickets. The "Ping Tickets" of Guangzhou and the "Red Yao" of Yangzhou are all Zhuang tickets.) However, notes issued by banks that undertake to pay are generally called bank promissory notes and are abbreviated as "promissory notes." In terms of legal status, the two are equal. (Editor's note: Today, Zhuang tickets issued by Shanghai money shops are marked with the words "promissory note," in compliance with the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Law.)</p>
<p>The form of Zhuang tickets is generally similar, but not uniform. They are usually made of thick Xuan paper, mostly white, and sometimes printed with light-colored patterns. They are divided into sight drafts and time drafts. Sight drafts are payable upon presentation, while time drafts range from five to ten days (Article 41 of the Shanghai Money Trade Regulations stipulates a maximum of ten days). According to law, the amount of a sight draft that does not specify a payee must be at least 50 yuan (Article 10 of the Implementing Rules of the Bills of Exchange Law). However, in practice, the amounts are often large, up to hundreds of thousands or even millions. They are usually in bearer form. The first line is the number, the second line is the amount, the third line is the name of the issuing money shop (with a seal but no signature), and the fourth line is the date (sight drafts show the date of issue, while time drafts show the month and day of maturity without the word "maturity"). The overlapping part of the ticket is also numbered, and the amount, date, and overlapping part are stamped with detailed patterns. The size and style of the characters are not fixed and are determined by each money shop.</p>
<p>Money shops have a long history, and Zhuang tickets have an excellent reputation, even surpassing bank promissory notes. They can circulate freely in the domestic industrial and commercial sectors, and even foreign banks and trading houses are happy to accept them, trusting them more than bank promissory notes. In the past, when bank promissory notes were not yet commonly used, foreign banks and trading houses almost refused to accept anything other than Zhuang tickets in transactions with Chinese merchants. Therefore, the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors commonly call Zhuang tickets "golden butterflies," able to fly all over the sky without any obstacles.</p>
<p>2.  Reasons for the Excellent Reputation of Zhuang Tickets</p>
<p>The nature, form, types, and position of Zhuang tickets in the financial world have been briefly described above. The reason why Zhuang tickets have been able to win the trust of society and gain the reputation of "golden butterflies flying all over the sky" is not accidental. The reasons can be found in the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Zhuang tickets are based on money shops, and payment is unconditionally guaranteed by the money shops. Money shops have a long history and held a leading position in the financial world of China in the past. Before the rise of modern banks, every commercial port and major city was sure to have several powerful money shops that controlled the economic lifeline of the entire city. Therefore, Zhuang tickets also circulated unhindered, and over time, the habit became deeper, and the trust of society became even more solid.</p>
<p>(2) Zhuang tickets are issued by money shops, and the money shops are the principal debtors of the Zhuang tickets. In the past, money shops were all sole proprietorships or partnerships (although some have recently been reorganized into limited liability companies in accordance with the Banking Law, partnerships are still by far the absolute majority, especially in other ports). Therefore, the capital owner or partners bear unlimited or joint and several unlimited liability, so the payment guarantee for Zhuang tickets seems to be more substantial.</p>
<p>(3) In Shanghai, exchange money shops are the elite of the money industry. The qualifications and procedures for "entering the garden" (joining the Shanghai Money Trade Association) are very strict, and their financial strength and reputation are very strong. Therefore, the Zhuang tickets they issue can naturally spread without being promoted.</p>
<p>(4) Historically, forgeries and counterfeit signatures of Zhuang tickets have been rare. Even if the issuing money shop unfortunately goes bankrupt, it must give priority to repaying the holders of Zhuang tickets, so they will not be implicated. This point is most trusted by society.</p>
<p>(5) Also, in Shanghai, the Shanghai Money Trade Regulations also stipulate: "…For current account customers who issue Zhuang tickets to money shops, whether they have already paid the money shop, bought goods, or discounted the tickets, if it is clearly confirmed that there are accounts to check, goods to point to, or that it is a case of embezzlement by a watchman or self-deception, the ticket holder shall not, at any time, request the money shop to report the loss and stop payment…" (See Article 45, Paragraph 1 of the revised regulations of the Shanghai Money Trade Regulations in 1933. However, it is not absolutely impossible to report a loss, but the conditions and procedures for reporting a loss are very strict.) It can be seen that holding a ticket is equivalent to obtaining cash, and there are very few disputes, so it is almost inevitable that it will be welcomed by people.</p>
<p>(6) Furthermore, because the acceptance (bank or commercial acceptance) and discounting of bills of exchange in China are still in their infancy, and the circulation of checks is not yet widespread, there is actually a great need for a type of negotiable currency. It is even more urgent for merchants to finance their capital. Now that Zhuang tickets were used habitually before bank promissory notes, they are easily circulated in society and surpass bank promissory notes.</p>
<p>(7) In addition, the Chinese industrial and commercial sectors have always preferred to be conservative, and although the new banks also have a "current account" department, the transaction procedures are ultimately more mechanical and meticulous than those of money shops. Therefore, the old-style or semi-modern industrial and commercial enterprises that occupy an absolute majority in various places are happy to deal with money shops. This is also one of the reasons why Zhuang tickets are popular.</p>
<p>3.  Customs and Laws Regarding Zhuang Tickets</p>
<p>Zhuang tickets are mostly in "bearer" form (referred to as "small header"), and because of their excellent credit, they can be transferred by delivery (i.e., the transfer of the ticket) and can be circulated without restriction. The person transferring the ticket confidently says that delivery of the Zhuang ticket is "reliable" (a Shanghai slang term), and the recipient is sure to accept it without doubt. This is no problem for Zhuang tickets that are genuine, and for this reason, Zhuang tickets can fly all over the sky.</p>
<p>However, with the multiple transfers of bearer instruments, it is often difficult to ascertain the original payer, and the amount of Zhuang tickets is often very large. Once a forgery or counterfeit signature occurs, the final holder of the ticket will inevitably be at a disadvantage. However, in practice, endorsements are not made when transferring the ticket. Therefore, the final holder of the ticket has no recourse against the "prior parties" (i.e., all those who previously participated in the transfer) except to negotiate with the party from whom he received the ticket. If we speak of safeguards, this is rather weak.</p>
<p>The fact that Zhuang tickets do not need to be endorsed for transfer is not only a custom, but also a legal provision. Bearer instruments can be transferred without endorsement under the law. In my opinion, both custom and law are inappropriate and worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>The only reason custom recognizes that Zhuang tickets do not need to be endorsed for transfer is that Zhuang tickets are golden butterflies with excellent credit, and there is no need for endorsement. However, commerce is becoming increasingly complex, and people's hearts are not as pure as they used to be. Without endorsement, there is much room for doubt. In fact, not to mention the past, recently a yarn store claimed that it had been defrauded of two double-horse yarn warehouse receipts (20 pieces) with counterfeit Zhuang tickets and published a notice in the newspaper declaring the two warehouse receipts invalid. Another yarn store claimed that it had legally purchased the yarn and that the counterfeit Zhuang tickets were not paid out by their store, so the warehouse receipts could not be declared invalid, and also published a notice in the newspaper to defend their position. Which side is right or wrong in this dispute is not for outsiders to judge arbitrarily, and it must be resolved by law. However, from this, it can be seen that this ticket must have been transferred many times, but the rights were transferred without endorsement, only by delivery of the ticket. Now that the issue of authenticity has arisen, the lack of endorsement is clearly felt to be inappropriate. If there had been endorsement, the method of negotiation could be determined, and the safeguards would be greatly increased.</p>
<p>As for the law, why does it not stipulate that bearer instruments must also be endorsed for transfer? Because possession is the key to proving the right to claim payment for bearer instruments. Whoever possesses the instrument is the payee, regardless of the previous transfer or source. There is also another legislative reason: no endorsement is required, which facilitates circulation and promotes the prevalence of negotiable currency. However, I believe that modern commerce is becoming increasingly complex, and bills of exchange are transferred many times. Although China has always valued morality and credit, there may be a mixture of good and bad. In order to prevent problems before they occur and to fairly resolve disputes, it seems appropriate to transfer by endorsement. Moreover, endorsement is not troublesome, and blank endorsement (i.e., only the signature of the endorser is required, without specifying the name of the endorsee) is very convenient. Requiring endorsement for transfer does not seem to affect the circulation of bills of exchange. Moreover, promissory notes are credit securities, not payment securities. Whether the promissory note itself is counterfeit cannot be absolutely certain. If the note is endorsed along the way, there will at least be a trace to follow, which seems to be beneficial and not harmful to the use of bills of exchange.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Law, there are four legally required conditions for a promissory note: (1) a statement that it is a promissory note; (2) a fixed amount; (3) an unconditional promise to pay; and (4) the date of issue. However, Chinese Zhuang tickets do not usually state that they are promissory notes (bank promissory notes do), nor do they have the phrase "unconditional promise to pay." Legally, this does not comply with the requirements. Therefore, once a dispute arises with a Zhuang ticket, whether the law recognizes it as a promissory note and is bound by the Bills of Exchange Law seems to be questionable. It is best to comply with the legal provisions.</p>
<p>Also, the "name" of Zhuang tickets is not universal or uniform in fact, and the customs of use vary from region to region. What inconvenience would this cause if Zhuang tickets were circulated in inter-port transactions! The above points are worthy of consideration by the money industry. In terms of legislation, the chapter on promissory notes in the Bills of Exchange Law seems to be too simple and has many points that need to be considered.</p>
<h3>China's Economic Construction During Wartime</h3>
<p>— Weng Wenhao</p>
<p>The material in this article is extracted from Dr. Weng Wenhao, Minister of Economic Affairs, on the economic situation of China during wartime, as reported by the English-language "Wartime China Society." It describes the economic construction of China since the war in great detail. It is specially translated so that people who are concerned about the situation in the interior can understand a glimpse of the economic construction within China. Idle words</p>
<p>Before the July 7th Incident, the Chinese government had drafted a five-year plan to establish heavy industry. According to this plan, the establishment of heavy industry would be mainly in the three provinces of Henan, Hebei, and Jiangxi. After the outbreak of the war, due to practical needs, the government was forced to establish a solid economic fortress in the interior of the country. In the southwestern and northwestern provinces, the authorities worked hard to develop mining, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, and hydropower industries. Until recently, a three-year plan for mining construction was approved. The biggest goal of this plan is to promote the "self-reliance" of China's wartime economy, so as to achieve a state of "self-sufficiency."</p>
<p>Using the machinery relocated from Hanyeping and Daye Iron Works, the government established a large-scale refining plant in Sichuan Province. In addition, another steel mill under preparation is about to open in the same area. Yunnan Province also has a refining plant about to be established, but the main area for the development of the steel industry planned by the authorities is still in Sichuan Province.</p>
<p>New-style electric furnaces for auxiliary steelmaking have been widely installed throughout the southwest. In order to remedy the insufficient supply of pig iron, the authorities are actively purchasing privately-owned pig iron ore to increase the supply of pig iron. This year, the supply of pig iron in Sichuan and other areas of Free China has increased significantly. It is expected that in one year, the total production of iron and steel will be sufficient for wartime military and industrial needs.</p>
<p>The development of coal mines, under the active management of the government, has achieved great success. The rich coal seams discovered in Jiangxi, Henan, Sichuan, Shanxi, Yunnan, Gansu, and Xikang provinces are sufficient for the construction of new railways and industrial power. In order to solve the shortage of fuel, the government has established many new alcohol factories. In the vast territory of Free China, underground copper deposits have been exploited in large quantities. At the same time, the government has also established several new electric smelting plants. In addition, the mining of gold, mercury, antimony, zinc, and tungsten is also very active. The production of tin has increased rapidly in recent years. China still accounts for the world's leading share of antimony and tungsten. The large exports of tin, mercury, tungsten, and antimony in China's foreign trade prove the sharp increase in the production of these rare metals.</p>
<p>There are eleven large-scale hydropower companies, separately located in Henan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shanxi, and Gansu provinces. There are also three even larger hydropower companies currently under construction. Once completed, the electricity generated will flow throughout Free China, and the cost will be lower than that of urban hydropower companies.</p>
<p>During the first year after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, 168 machine and iron factories from the coastal areas moved to the interior. Their main tasks were: (1) manufacturing supplies; (2) manufacturing prime movers—such as various motors and generators; (3) manufacturing appliances; (4) manufacturing production tools; (5) manufacturing axles and other transportation tools.</p>
<p>In addition, the authorities' efforts to develop the electrical and chemical industries have also achieved remarkable results. Among the 28 newly established state-run electrical factories, they are currently working on the manufacture of telegraph parts. One of the machine factories, which originally specialized in the manufacture of electric fans, is now manufacturing military wireless telegraph machines day and night. Free China under the rule of the National Government has produced a large amount of thunderbolts, submarine telegraphs, vacuum tubes, military telephones, dry batteries, and other tools needed to transmit news. As for the chemical industry, there are 54 chemical factories that specialize in the manufacture of chemical raw materials. Their products, in addition to being used to manufacture matches and water douding, are directly used in the manufacture of military supplies.</p>
<p>The biggest goal of economic construction in wartime China is to increase exports and achieve self-sufficiency in domestic production, without relying on imports of foreign goods. In the long-term war, China's foreign trade has entered a new stage. The government is providing as much as possible for the needs of international trade to strengthen the domestic financial structure, and at the same time, it is also increasing the purchasing power of the domestic people. As long as our own heavy industry has not yet been fully developed, increasing foreign exports is essential. China's exports can be classified into the following five categories: (1) Agricultural products—such as silk, tea, cotton, peanuts, vegetable oil, and sesame; (2) Forest products—such as tung oil; (3) Livestock products—such as eggs, egg products, pig bristles, wood, sheepskins, hides, leather bags, etc.; (4) Mineral products—such as tin, antimony, tinplate, etc.; (5) Handicraft products—such as embroidery, silk fabrics, etc. The total annual value of imports of each of these categories is tens of millions of yuan or more. In order to promote the development of foreign exports, the National Government has formulated three principles: improving production methods, providing production loans, and direct government operation. Tungsten, tin, mercury, tung oil, steel, wool, tea, and wood will be exported directly by the government. The annual import value of these products is around 600,000 yuan. If the government actively manages them, it is expected that there will be continued increases in the near future. Tungsten production has tripled in the past two years. Tin production has also seen amazing development recently. Tung oil was not self-sufficient before the war, but now it has become one of China's main export products.</p>
<p>Before the incident, although China was an agricultural country, it still had to import 2% of foreign rice to make up for the shortage of domestic production. In recent years, due to bumper harvests in various parts of the interior, there is no longer a lack of rice. As long as transportation methods can be improved, Free China under the rule of the National Government no longer needs to rely on foreign imports for food.</p>
<p>The increase in clothing raw materials should also not be ignored. Cotton production can be self-sufficient during wartime. According to reliable estimates, the national cotton production in 1937 reached more than 12 million dan. In addition to self-sufficiency, there is also a considerable amount available for export. But what still causes us unlimited regret is that China's main cotton-producing areas have fallen into the hands of the Japanese. In the southwestern corner, the cotton production has always been very low in recent years and is not enough for self-sufficiency. The supply of fiber used for textiles in the area is also insufficient. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the government has been working to improve cotton seeds in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, and has also been transporting its surplus cotton from Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan provinces to the southwest, so that the textile factories in the southwest corner will not have to worry about a shortage of raw materials.</p>
<p>The government has recently been working hard to increase cotton production and support the development of handicrafts in the interior. Since 1938, it has earnestly implemented the plan to mobilize refugees from the war zones to participate in land reclamation, with areas covering the five provinces of Yunnan, Henan, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Fujian. According to accurate statistics, 310,000 refugees have reclaimed 5.4 million mu of barren and undeveloped land. The Central China, Communications, Agricultural, and Farmers Banks and the Agricultural Credit Administration have provided large amounts of soft loans for land reclamation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the economic blockade against Japan, which has been implemented for the past three years, has been very effective. This blockade is continuing to be implemented, and the results have been significant. The Japanese dream of "using war to support war" has also been severely dealt with by our authorities, making it impossible for them to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>First, on August 7, 1939, the National Government promulgated the regulations prohibiting the export of goods from various places, stipulating that two categories of goods were within the scope of the prohibition. The first category is raw materials for the manufacture of military supplies, such as coal, salt, mineral products, cotton, etc. The second category, although it cannot be directly used for the manufacture of military supplies, can be exported by the enemy to third countries in exchange for foreign currency to strengthen their domestic financial structure. This category includes hides, wool, pig bristles, soybeans, etc. According to reports from military and political authorities and customs officials, in the past, only 60 or so types of exported goods were simultaneously transported to Japan. In order to prevent this phenomenon from continuing to exist, the authorities specially established a water and land transportation office to resolve this matter, and ordered all responsible departments to purchase a large amount of the above two categories of goods within Free China to prevent unscrupulous people from secretly smuggling them out. From whatever point of view, the measures taken by the authorities to vigorously prevent the Japanese from utilizing our country's resources in the occupied areas and at the front have been very effective.</p>
<p>Although the total value of China's exports to Japan in 1938 was 116 million yuan, it decreased to 66 million yuan in 1939. In order to make up for the losses caused by smuggling, the authorities have established a regulation to boycott Japanese goods. This regulation includes goods manufactured by factories in Japanese-occupied areas, the imperial mainland, and its colonies. This is a practical and effective method of boycott, making it impossible for the Japanese to exchange their products for legal tender, purchase foreign exchange to obtain raw materials needed for production, and reduce the scope of their foreign markets.</p>
<p>Together with the movement to boycott Japanese goods, the government is paying close attention to the issue of national daily necessities and supplies. The government is now actively supporting the development of small factories and handicrafts, so that the people will not buy cheap Japanese goods. I believe that the best way to do this is to increase the production of our domestic products.</p>
<p>Turning back to the movement to boycott Japanese goods, it is no longer limited to a corner of mainland China. Among the 10 million overseas Chinese in the Nanyang Islands, this movement has also begun, and it has been very successful. Today, all parts of the world are responding and dealing a fatal blow to the Japanese goods market. What is worth our encouragement is that peace-loving countries such as Britain, the United States, India, and Australia are currently conducting a long-term economic war against Japan to expand the scope of this movement and jointly boycott the invasion of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>In addition to this, our government has also launched a fierce guerrilla war in the Japanese-occupied areas to undermine the economic foundation of the Japanese. As a result of the inability of the occupied areas to be fully controlled, the total value of goods imported by Japan into the occupied areas in 1939 reached 210 million yuan. Compared with 150 million yuan in 1937 and 200 million yuan in 1938, this is an amazing increase.</p>
<p>I must clearly point out that this increase in manufacturing is a pathological phenomenon for Japan's entire foreign exports. Because the more Japan exports to the occupied areas, the more Japan reduces its exports to other places. They can only obtain Japanese yen and counterfeit currency, but cannot obtain the foreign exchange they need. The outwardly strong but inwardly weak Japan urgently needs foreign exchange to purchase raw materials for industrial manufacturing. Therefore, the current surge in Japanese exports to the coastal provinces of China is tantamount to making large investments in its occupied areas for the foreign exchange it could have obtained. We can assert that this investment by Japan will not be profitable unless they adjust the economic situation in the occupied areas, actively develop natural resources, and increase total production, so as to maintain the continuous rotation of Japanese industry.</p>
<p>In summary, the surge in Japanese exports to China is clearly a burden that weakens its national power. The destructive policies implemented by our government in the occupied areas have dealt an infinite blow to the Japanese warlords' dreams of carrying out any construction projects in the areas they occupy.</p>
<h3>Answer to Mr. Jiang Xun</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the Sino-Foreign Exchange's listed rates for the four-part official, commercial, and semi-commercial use, Shanghai has neither listed them nor applied for a liaison office.</p>
<p>(2) Tax exemptions on imports must be approved by the Ministry of Finance; Customs is the implementing agency.</p>
<p>(3) Transferring British gold to the United States; if it were in the UK, approval would be obtained, and it would be paid at the official rate (4 yuan and 2 fen). Buying and selling British and American currencies in the United States follows the free pound exchange rate. In Shanghai, British and American currencies cannot be directly settled; in other words, one must sell British pounds at the market rate and then buy US dollars at the market rate. (Based on current Shanghai British and American foreign exchange market conditions, the exchange rate of British pounds to US dollars is only 3 yuan and 56 jiao per pound, while in New York it is above 4 yuan.)</p>
<p>(4) To the best of my knowledge, there seem to be few books specifically publishing regulations for war-time consumer cooperatives.</p>

<h3>Financial Review</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>—November 23rd—</p>
<p>In terms of exports, Shanghai has also been profoundly affected by the European war. For example, trade with Germany has been completely severed, and trade with countries such as Belgium and the Netherlands has also been greatly reduced; the figures for the first ten months of this year are only one percent of last year's. However, considering the overall export trade, the changes in exchange rates, and the development of trade with various Asian regions such as British India, Burma, Hong Kong, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand, as well as the leap in trade with countries such as the UK and the US, good trade results are still evident. Except for January, exports rose from 72.9 million yuan in February to 93.7 million yuan in April. After May, due to the easing of exchange rates, which was unfavorable to exports, exports decreased from 151.7 million yuan in May to 98.7 million yuan in July. From August onwards, foreign exchange generally tightened, and export trade increased again from 120 million yuan in August to 135 million yuan in October.</p>
<p>Studying Shanghai's trade situation over the past ten months, it can be divided into three stages: the first stage is from January to April, the second stage is from May to July, and the third stage is from August to October. The situation in each stage is shown in the table. The evolution of these three stages of trade can be seen from the analysis in the previous two sections, which shows that the international situation has a very significant impact on trade. However, there is another issue, which is the connection between trade and exchange rates. According to the statistics, in the second and third stages, exports decreased and imports increased due to the easing of exchange rates, and then exports increased and imports decreased due to the tightening of exchange rates. In the first stage, as exchange rates fluctuated slightly, export trade also gradually increased, but import trade did not decrease but intensified, which seems inconsistent with the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on trade. In fact, it can be explained as follows: the slight fluctuation of exchange rates in the first stage was anticipated by everyone. To prevent future tightening of exchange rates, importers declared imports while exchange rates were favorable. However, after May, no one could predict whether exchange rates would ease or tighten, so exchange rates completely dominated the progress and retreat of trade, which was due to seasonal factors, thus forming an abnormal phenomenon.</p>
<p>What will be the trend of Shanghai's trade in the future? Although it is impossible to make wild guesses, the trade situation will certainly change due to the influence of the international situation. The evolution of the exchange market influenced by the international situation is also an important factor dominating Shanghai's trade situation, which is beyond doubt. (End)</p>
<p>Slight Fluctuations in Sugar Prices</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market remained quiet, lacking any improvement. The association quoted spot prices for No. 24 coarse white sugar at 71 yuan and 8 jiao for the end of the month delivery from foreign warehouses, an increase of only 1 jiao. BS Mark Dutch refined white sugar was at 70 yuan, a decrease of 5 jiao from the previous day (21st). There were no transactions for Taikoo granulated white sugar at the high end; only HX Mark had some transactions, priced at 68 yuan and 3 jiao (goods from the East Warehouse) with no changes.</p>
<p>Xinghua Longans Are Expected to Arrive Continuously</p>
<p>Since the first batch of Xinghua longans arrived in small quantities, subsequent shipments have been lacking due to extreme transportation difficulties. According to news from Xinghua currency, customers have telegraphed to insure against marine risks, and the goods are expected to be shipped soon and should arrive in Shanghai in the near future. However, overseas expenses continue to increase, resulting in higher costs, making it difficult to offer low prices. Furthermore, goods transported via miscellaneous routes incur special expenses, causing prices to rebound by 20 to 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Cheap Eastern Shrimp is Affecting Other Goods</p>
<p>Recently, with the arrival of many Eastern shrimp, Chaozhou-edged shrimp is sold for 370 yuan, Yuan Dong-edged shrimp for 330 yuan, and a final price of 300 yuan. Therefore, other shrimp are greatly suppressed, with no market to speak of. New shipments of Annam shrimp have arrived in Hong Kong, but due to roundabout routes, overseas expenses are higher, with Hong Kong prices around 80 yuan. Offering them in Shanghai would require a price of 400 yuan, making it difficult to sell in the Shanghai market at this price, causing various firms to wait and see and not dare to get involved.</p>
<p>Jellyfish Skin and Jellyfish Heads Are Both Seeing High Prices</p>
<p>Due to difficult transactions and very thin inventories in Shanghai, Ningbo-produced jellyfish skin and jellyfish heads are seeing further price increases. Yesterday, jellyfish skin in the market rose to 110 yuan, and jellyfish heads rose to 85 yuan. The market situation remains tight.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>"Princess" as Dance Partner</h3>
<p>— Wansui</p>
<p>When I read the advertisement "Princess as Dance Partner," I thought it was the prelude to another Hollywood movie like "Affairs of a Royal Court"—a princess, unwilling to endure the loneliness of the palace, quietly leaves the capital to work as a dancer in a certain cafe. One evening, she meets a young gentleman, and they fall in love at first sight. After several twists and turns, they become a couple. But after reading on, my "assumption" was completely wrong! Our princess is not in Hollywood but right here in Shanghai, China; and she is not a shadow on the screen but "of noble birth"! Although the gimmicks on the "isolated island" are constantly changing, is there anything more novel and exciting than a princess condescending to work as a dance partner?</p>
<p>Since "folk tale" movies have become popular, our romantic young men have been overwhelmed with "invitations" and have started advertising for lawyers. Then, in this "once-in-a-lifetime opportunity," shouldn't they come together and show off their skills? A secret garden engagement cannot compare to a princess tossing a silk ball!</p>
<p>The so-called "grand opening yesterday, packed with people" is certainly not an exaggeration. Those future sons-in-law will not be stingy with a mere two-yuan admission ticket; moreover, those who "cherish the heart of protecting flowers" are ten, hundred, or even a thousand times more than romantic young men.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our princess has presented a difficult problem: ten yuan per dance, two hundred for sitting at the table, five hundred for going out—this is just the "starting point." To achieve the "championship" of winning the silk ball, the "advertisement" does not even specify a clear amount but vaguely says "it would be an honor to receive more care and guidance." The "dignity of a princess" is probably expressed here. Sons-in-law who want to "climb the dragon and attach to the phoenix" should first look at the checks under their feet; otherwise, lawyer advertisements may not be legally effective.</p>
<h3>Expanding the Rat Eradication Campaign</h3>
<p>— Bai Xi</p>
<p>Plague, also known as the Black Death, is a terrible infectious disease, spreading rapidly and with a high mortality rate. It usually prevails in port cities. Before an outbreak, rats must first become infected. Plague bacteria are transmitted from rats to humans via fleas, hence the name plague.</p>
<p>The symptoms of plague can be divided into bubonic plague, pneumonic plague, and septicemic plague, with bubonic plague of the inguinal lymph nodes being the most common and pneumonic plague being the most dangerous. The general symptoms mainly include heart failure, hemorrhagic inflammation, and severe neurological symptoms, which are caused by the toxins of plague bacteria. The mortality rate of bubonic plague is 30 to 90 percent, and those infected with pneumonic plague rarely survive. Those who recover from the disease have immunity, but their health does not easily recover, so there is a possibility of dying from a sudden severe illness—namely, plague exhaustion.</p>
<p>When the plague is prevalent, disinfection is extremely important. Patients must be strictly isolated, and the epidemic area cannot be connected with the outside world. If necessary, houses and equipment must be burned to prevent the spread of the epidemic. In addition, preventive vaccinations can be used, injecting plague serum or bacterial solution to prevent infection.</p>
<p>The plague originated in Europe and has spread widely. In our country, the northeastern provinces are often epidemic due to the transmission of marmots. Recently, plague was discovered in Ningbo. Shanghai and Ningbo are close and have frequent transportation, so people are quite concerned that the plague may invade Shanghai. The Jianghai Customs is also paying close attention to this and has formulated measures to quarantine ships from eastern Zhejiang, berthing at Wusong for strict inspection and fumigation disinfection to prevent the intrusion of plague bacteria.</p>
<p>The fundamental method of preventing plague must start with every household, regularly maintaining the cleanliness of rooms, sweeping away dust and debris, and simplifying indoor equipment to make it easy to move, so that rats and fleas have nowhere to hide. If rats are found indoors, they must be caught and killed as soon as possible. Recently, the Public Works Department is working hard to kill rats. The Health Department of the bureau has a rat-catching section, and citizens can request the department to send personnel to catch rats at any time. According to statistics from the Public Works Department, the department receives requests from citizens to kill more than 30,000 rats per month.</p>
<p>In order to eradicate the vector of plague transmission and protect the health of citizens, the rat eradication campaign needs to be expanded and promoted. We hope that the concession authorities will use propaganda to raise the awareness of most citizens about plague prevention and mobilize together to kill rats. In the midst of the plague epidemic, this is a very meaningful task.</p>
<p>The Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>Where Does the Dance Queen End Up?</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Report and Explanation</p>
<p>Hawthorne and I rushed to the hospital, and after some negotiation, someone led us into Li Zhiban's ward. In the ward, besides Ni Jinshou, there was also a female nurse dressed in white. Both of them looked solemn and tense. The old man lay on the bed, covered with a white sheet. The old man closed his eyes, opened his mouth, and gasped heavily and rapidly, with two red spots on his cheeks.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said to Hawthorne in a low voice, "He was like this when I arrived. He hasn't said a word. His eyes opened once, saw me, and then closed immediately."</p>
<p>Hawthorne looked at the old man and said in a low voice, "His fever seems very high. I suppose it's unlikely he'll be able to talk?"</p>
<p>When Hawthorne said the last sentence, his gaze shifted to the female nurse's face. The nurse was very alert and immediately shook her head, answering Hawthorne's indirect question. I saw the old man's eyes slowly open, but his pupils seemed to have lost their ability to focus, only staring blankly at the ceiling above before closing again.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou said to Hawthorne, "It doesn't matter much if he can't talk. Song Quan has already explained the details of his stabbing very clearly."</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and said, "That's good. But I hope he can talk, not only to report the details of being stabbed, but also to explain his stabbing."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou was slightly stunned, his surprised eyes staring at Hawthorne. He didn't know yet that Li Zhiban was the real culprit who killed Wang Lilan. His surprise was natural.</p>
<p>Hawthorne answered Ni Jinshou's unspoken question: "Yes, he is the real culprit in this case. But that doesn't matter much. I can imagine his actions. I think this old man is useless. There's no point in us staying here. You should quickly send a telegram to Suzhou, telling his son, Li Shouqi, to come quickly."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou nodded and said, "Speaking of Li Shouqi, I have to tell you. The Suzhou police station's reply has already arrived. Li Shouqi was indeed in Suzhou by lunchtime yesterday, the eighteenth. He is still in Suzhou today." (176)</p>

<h3>Vitamins and Appearance</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Getting enough vitamins every day can improve your appearance.</p>
<p>To get real beauty, good beauty products are very helpful, and it is also important to maintain good health, because with good health, you will have clean, flawless skin, healthy, white teeth, no respiratory diseases, and no bad temper.</p>
<p>To maintain good health, you must absorb enough vitamins every day. The following foods are very effective for maintaining health and improving appearance.</p>
<p>1. Milk: Drink half a pound or a pound every day.</p>
<p>2. Eggs: It's better to eat two every day if you can.</p>
<p>3. Fruits: Such as oranges and apples, are very good foods.</p>
<p>4. Grains: Such as bread, eat in the morning or as a snack in the afternoon.</p>
<p>5. Vegetables: Eat at least one type of vegetable every day.</p>
<p>6. Lettuce: Eat once a day.</p>
<p>The above six foods are formulated based on the vitamin A, B, C, and D needed by each person, because these four vitamins have the following functions:</p>
<p>Vitamin A can grow the mucous membranes of the respiratory and digestive organs, resist diseases, and promote eye health, improve eyesight, and help growth.</p>
<p>Vitamin B is very beneficial to the nervous system and greatly assists in the development of the body. Vitamin C can produce the inner lining of blood vessels and joints, which is very important for the health of teeth and gums, and indirectly can produce a beautiful personality.</p>
<p>Vitamin D manages the regulation of calcium and phosphorus in the human body. If vitamin D is lacking, it is enough to promote tooth decay and rickets. Vitamin D is also known as sunlight vitamin, because in the past it was easy for people to get sunlight. Modern buildings obstruct sunlight, so we have to get this needed vitamin D from food. Milk, eggs, and cod liver oil all contain appropriate amounts of vitamin D.</p>
<h3>How to Protect the Beauty of Your Hands</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Because a housewife operates the housework, it is very easy for the hands to become rough, so protecting the skin of the hands is a very urgent task.</p>
<p>You can try the following method:</p>
<p>First, use a good cream, and after washing your hands, apply it to the surface and back of your hands, and then rub your elbows to make the skin soft. If you have enough time, then you can implement the following actions:</p>
<p>(1) Rest your elbow on a table or other place, straighten your fingers, and rub alongside the straightened fingers with the other hand, just like wearing a very tight glove.</p>
<p>(2) Straighten your hands and shake them from side to side, the faster the better.</p>
<p>(3) Make a fist with your hands, then release them, doing this continuously and quickly for two minutes.</p>
<p>(4) Use your fingers to make a piano-playing gesture (just like you are playing the piano), and move your fingers as fast as possible.</p>
<p>The above methods can make the blood move, promote the metabolism of the skin, and undoubtedly, the skin of the hands can also be delicate, but you must have considerable perseverance to be effective.</p>
<h3>Several Incorrect Beauty Practices</h3>
<p>— Man Yun</p>
<p>If you also have this kind of mistake</p>
<p>Please try to correct it and see the results</p>
<p>Several Chinese women who truly understand the art of beauty have very good beauty results, but many women often cannot get good results because of some beauty mistakes. The following points are especially common.</p>
<p>(1) You should apply rouge before applying face powder, so that the color of the rouge will be more harmonious and even. Many women apply face powder first and then rouge, but this procedure is actually wrong.</p>
<p>(2) When applying rouge, you should apply it to the lower eyelids and apply it towards the nose, gradually fading from dark to light, so that the mistake of revealing a white line between the cheeks and the lower eyelids can be avoided.</p>
<p>(3) Many women love to use white face powder, but in fact, only women with white skin can use white face powder. For those with slightly yellow complexions, the color of the face powder used should be deeper than the color of the skin. If a woman with dark skin uses white face powder, it will naturally not be harmonious.</p>
<p>(4) The method of applying powder, in general, is to start from the nose and apply it to the cheeks, but this method is wrong, and the result often makes the nose particularly shiny. The correct procedure for applying powder is to apply it to the cheeks first, starting from the ears, and finally apply it to the nose.</p>
<p>(5) The most beautiful form of eyebrows is to bend slightly upwards in the middle, which can harmonize with the shape of the eyes. Many people draw their eyebrows into an arc, which cannot produce the most beautiful form.</p>
<p>(6) Before applying rouge and face powder, you should use Vanishing Cream as a base. Some women use Cold Cream, but Cold Cream is used to protect the skin at night and should be wiped off in the morning.</p>
<h3>Methods of Protecting the Skin</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>To make beauty work produce beautiful results, protecting the skin cannot be ignored. You can use cleansing cream or cold cream on the palms and fingertips every night before going to bed. Follow the method below, and after a while, your skin will definitely be very smooth and tender.</p>
<p>1. Rub from the chin to the ears. 2. Rub from the nose to the cheekbones. 3. Rub from the center of the eyebrows upwards to the forehead. 4. Rub around the eyes. 5. Rub downwards on the nose. 6. Rub on the neck and shoulders, then from the back to the end of the hair.</p>
<p>You can refer to the picture on the left to perform the rubbing. You can also use the same method when removing cleansing cream or cold cream.</p>
<p>Neck Massage</p>
<p>The skin of the neck also needs considerable protection. When massaging, you can straighten your neck, and when you turn your head to the right, you can massage the left side of your neck. When you want to massage the right side of your neck, your head should turn to the left. As for when massaging, you can refer to the picture on the left.</p>
<h3>Rest Before Beauty</h3>
<p>— Added</p>
<p>Before starting beauty work, sufficient rest is very important. A woman should never come back from the tennis court and immediately put on a new dress to attend a banquet. She must first take a bath; otherwise, her appearance will definitely not be beautiful. At the same time, every woman should have a little time each day to engage in beauty work. This can also be said to be a right that every woman should have.</p>
<p>Here's a method that readers may want to try. It is sure to have good results and doesn't require a lot of time.</p>
<p>If your time doesn't allow you to take a bath first (it's better if you can), you can sit on the armchair in front of your dressing table, first wash your face once with hot water, then lean your head on the back of the chair, close your eyes, abandon all thoughts, and rest quietly for five minutes. You can eat a piece of candy in your mouth. After five minutes, you can open your eyes and start your beauty routine. The result will definitely be a fresh and delicate appearance.</p>
<p>This method is not invented by the author but is recorded in the decoration textbook written by Ms. Alma, an ornament expert in New York.</p>
<h3>Some Basic Knowledge About Beauty Products</h3>
<p>(1) The lids of all creams, powder boxes, and rouge should be tightly closed immediately after use. This can prevent the fragrance from dissipating and can also prevent messiness.</p>
<p>(2) Never apply beauty products in front of others, especially in front of men, because when a man sees a woman's incomplete appearance before applying beauty products, it is easy to create a bad impression.</p>
<p>(3) Never borrow other people's beauty products, because beauty products are absolutely personal. Borrowing beauty products from others will definitely be disliked by others. Moreover, the color of the beauty products used by each person is absolutely different. Borrowing from others is not a good method either.</p>
<p>(4) When you have guests at home, it is best to prepare some beauty products for them, specifically for their use. This shows the thoughtfulness of the host and the thoroughness of the hospitality.</p>
<h3>Health is a Condition of Beauty</h3>
<p>— Abridged translation of The Woman</p>
<p>Beauty is based on health. A woman with vigorous blood and no hidden illnesses is bound to be alluring throughout her body. Furthermore, with the help of cosmetics and beauty methods, one can undoubtedly reach a stage of perfect health and beauty. Therefore, early rising and early sleep, moderation in diet, regular exercise, and avoidance of irritating foods are all things that those who want to embark on the path to health and beauty should pay attention to.</p>

<h3>Reflections on Beauty</h3>
<p>— Wang</p>
<p>After women have been active in society for some time, or worked hard in the family, they often neglect themselves too much. Their most valuable asset—beauty—is severely damaged. The smooth and delicate skin of a young girl begins to show gradually enlarged pores; the scalp is dry and scaly; the hands lose their slenderness, and the skin color is not pleasing. The way to remedy this is to first abandon this attitude of neglecting oneself. If it is inconvenient to go to an expensive beauty salon, in addition to various famous cosmetics, you can also use the help of natural products to regain your beauty.</p>
<p>Do you want to know what kind of natural substances will contribute the most to you? If your skin is oily, eggs and milk can give you special help; the egg's contents are cleansing and firming, while milk can prevent pores from enlarging, cheese can make the skin soft and white, and sour milk can clear pimples on the skin. As for lemon, it has astringent and bleaching properties. Yeast is extremely nutritious and has special effects on dry skin, as does olive oil. Before implementing the following beauty methods, the face must be washed clean, not only to the jawline, but also to the neck and shoulders, and then use a warm or hot towel to relax the face, so that the skin can receive the benefits of the subsequently applied substances.</p>
<p>Egg Beauty Method: Very beneficial for normal or slightly oily skin. Separate the egg white from the yolk, mix it evenly, spread it all over the face and neck, and after it dries, apply a layer of egg yolk, alternating the application until one egg is used up. When the last layer is dry, wipe it off with a hot towel and gently massage the skin, but do not rub hard.</p>
<p>Egg, Honey, and Almond Powder Beauty Method: This is a method to make the skin soft and white. It requires the egg white of one egg, mixed with one spoonful each of almond powder and honey. Spread this wonderful blend evenly on the face and wipe it off with a hot towel after it dries.</p>
<p>Yeast, Milk, and Water Beauty Method: This method is specifically for treating dry skin. Use two pieces of yeast, plus equal amounts of milk and water, to mix into a fine and even paste. Before applying, first apply clean cheese to the face, wipe off the excess, leaving only a very thin layer, and then apply the yeast paste to the face and neck. After ten minutes of drying, wash it off with hot water.</p>
<p>Cream Beauty Method: Mix half a cup of cream with an appropriate amount of grain flour to form a paste, apply it to the face, and continue to add cream to keep it moist. After half an hour, wipe it off with a hot towel. This method can make the skin soft.</p>
<p>Sour Milk Complexion Enhancing Method: This method can maintain complexion for at least several nights; frequent implementation can also clear acne and pimples. Simply apply sour milk to the face before going to bed, and do not wipe it off after it dries, but wash off the remaining layer with soap and water in the morning.</p>
<p>Lemon Juice Astringent Method: Wrap a small piece of ice in a soaked gauze, dip it in some filtered lemon juice, and gently rub the face and neck to shrink pores and refresh the skin. Those with excessively large pores can do this every morning after washing their face. If lemon makes the skin feel dry, you can use ice alone, but don't forget to wrap it in gauze and not rub the skin directly.</p>
<p>Hair Protection Method: For those with dry hair or dandruff, put half of olive oil and half of castor oil in a bottle and shake vigorously to blend them together. After combing the hair for a considerable time, this mixed oil can be used with the fingertips to rub into the scalp, and then use a wrung-out hot towel to moisten the hair, so that the oil lines are loosened, and then wrap it with a towel or silk scarf overnight, so that the oil can fully penetrate into the scalp.</p>
<h3>Teenage Girls and Beauty</h3>
<p>— Fangfei</p>
<p>A teenage girl, when she reaches the age of sixteen, should consider her beauty issues. In fact, even a twelve- or thirteen-year-old girl can start paying attention to her hair and eyebrows.</p>
<p>In Hollywood, there are three young stars, namely Virginia Weidler, Ann Gillis, and Joan Carroll, who are already very mindful of their beauty issues. Virginia brushes her hair every morning and evening. Ann is very annoyed by the freckles on her face. Now her mother is trying to give her lemon juice and cold cream every day, which has reduced them a lot. Joan is very careful about her teeth, skin, and nails.</p>
<p>A girl who is not yet twenty years old cannot do too much when implementing beauty treatments, so Joan's mother only gives her a small amount of facial powder and applies some moisturizing ointment to her lips. Every night, she applies petroleum jelly to her eyelashes and eyebrows to give them a glossy color. Her hands are protected with fine creams, and her nails are trimmed fairly short, with pure white nail polish on top. She brushes her teeth three times a day and rubs her face with cream once a week, so her appearance is quite beautiful.</p>
<h3>Basic Knowledge About Hair Physiology</h3>
<p>— Manyun</p>
<p>Hair occupies a very important position in the overall appearance. Sometimes, the shortcomings of the facial contours can be concealed by the style of the hair. In fact, there is a lot of research value in the various aspects of hair. Dr. Wright, a professor at Colgate University in the United States, once published the following materials in the "American Weekly":</p>
<p>(1) Will your hair turn white overnight? No, although many substances can turn hair white, it is definitely not possible to make it turn white automatically immediately, because hair is not a living fatty tissue. Unless the pigment at the root of the hair is destroyed, the hair of elderly people turns white because their hair grows from roots without pigment.</p>
<p>(2) Is hair alive? Hair, except for the roots, is not alive. Therefore, to make hair beautiful, the scalp where the hair roots remain should receive adequate nutrition.</p>
<p>(3) Approximately how much hair is there? It is said that a person has a total of 104,000 hairs, but this is an average number, and there are definitely more or less.</p>
<p>(4) Will frequently shaving the hair make it grow faster? No, because the act of shaving does not affect hair growth at all, but after shaving, the regrown hair will appear coarser, because the tip of the hair has been shaved off.</p>
<p>(5) How many years can each hair stay on the head? On average, a hair can stay on the head for four to seven years. The root of the hair grows in a follicle. If this follicle enters a refined state, then the hair will fall out, but after this hair falls out, another hair will grow out of the follicle. Eyelashes fall out most easily; the life of an eyelash is probably four to five months.</p>
<p>(6) Is there a difference in hair growth between day and night? Yes, the speed of hair growth is faster during the day than at night, and it also grows faster in summer than in winter.</p>
<p>(7) Does worry affect hair growth? Worry has a great impact on the health of the whole body, which naturally indirectly affects hair growth.</p>
<p>(8) Does hair growing on the forehead not indicate stupidity? No, the height of hair growth has nothing to do with a person's intelligence.</p>
<h3>Several Proper Steps to Implement Beauty Work</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Based on years of research by Hollywood beauty expert Westmore, the following beauty steps have been formulated:</p>
<p>1. Apply cleansing cream to the face, applying it with upward motions, wait a moment, and then remove the cleansing cream with cotton cloth. At this time, the dirt in the skin pores can be removed.</p>
<p>2. Dip your fingers in beauty base cream and apply it evenly to the face as a foundation. (This cream is Vanishing Vream; various beauty products have different names. Translator's note.)</p>
<p>3. Apply rouge, liquid or powder, to the cheeks.</p>
<p>4. Apply eye shadow cream to the upper eyelids.</p>
<p>5. Apply appropriately colored powder to the face, applying it from the side near the ears towards the nose. Before applying the powder, you must first check whether the base cream, rouge, and eye shadow cream are applied perfectly.</p>
<p>6. Use a small brush to brush off excess powder on the edges of the hairline.</p>
<p>7. Then, use an eyebrow pencil to draw eyebrows, slightly lengthening them according to the natural shape of the eyebrows.</p>
<p>8. Apply mascara to the eyelashes, using an upward method for the upper eyelashes and a downward posture for the lower eyelashes.</p>
<p>9. At this time, you can see if the color of the rouge is moist and even. If necessary, you can reapply an appropriate amount of rouge.</p>
<p>10. Apply lipstick to the lips.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Weimin</p>
<p>The U.S. Public Health Service and the Health Museum have provided the following materials to promote physical health. They can also be used as a reference for beauty work and are also very useful common knowledge.</p>
<p>(1) Bad breath cannot be removed with mouthwash. Bad breath is indeed a major obstacle in social settings. It is emitted from inside the body, sometimes because there are decaying food scraps remaining in the mouth or between the teeth. The proper method is to remove these food scraps, sometimes requiring the help of a dentist.</p>
<p>(2) Perming hair will not increase hair density, because each hair has its root, so it will never be affected by external influences and increase hair density.</p>
