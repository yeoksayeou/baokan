<p>社評</p>
<h3>英德戰爭的前瞻</h3>
<p>英國與德義之間，至少在最近沒有媾和的希望；至戰爭開始的方式、大的還是由德義方面發動一個希特勒式的，暴風雨般的「閃電戰」；庶幾迅急地擊潰英倫三島的抵抗，而予以征服；以便在其他一切國際演變不及影響戰爭的過程以前，希特勒得先完成他統制全歐洲的計劃。</p>
<p>茲就本問題，分兩方面加以檢討：第一，對英國施行所謂「閃電戰」，其可能性如何？第二，德國對於整個歐戰的次一階段，究竟何所希圖？</p>
<p>所謂「閃電戰」也者，照希特勒自己所下的解釋，不過兩點；（一）所謂說戰就戰，令敵人措手不及；在敵人最懈怠，最不注意的時候，忽然像閃電般的，開始動作。（二）集中力量，首先打擊敵人最致命的弱點；且須對於這個弱點上，一而再再而三的打擊得最重。例如去年的波蘭戰役，甚至在開戰前一剎那間，波蘭當局還以爲德國絕對不敢挑起大規模的歐洲大戰；因之，在波蘭決心抵抗的前提之下，他們斷定希特勒絕對沒有進攻波蘭的勇氣；於是儘量在外交上玩着縱橫椑闔，用種種方法向德國嘲笑，而另一面却完全呈現着不嚴肅的懈怠狀態。希特勒針對這現象，就發動了對波蘭的十一路總攻擊，收穫了「閃電戰術」第一次凱旋。又例如最近的法國戰役，原來法國在這次大戰裏的最致命弱點，便是人的資源的絕對劣勢。希特勒抓住了法國這個弱點，集中陸空軍，急湧而前，逼着法國立刻決戰，使法國的這一劣勢立即暴露了出來。因之「閃電戰術」於是第二次收到了所期望的勝利。至於今後對英戰役，英國不會像波蘭似的措手不及的條件，但在陸軍數量，配備與訓練方面，英國還是絕對劣勢。假如德國可以壓迫英國陸軍即行決戰，則在最短期間，也許德國就可以制勝。然而在歐洲大陸與英倫三島之間，却隔着一道海洋；在德國渡海進攻的過程中，牠首先就得遭逢英國的海軍。試就海洋上的力量作一對比，却是德國的最大弱點所在；假使希特勒別無所謂秘密武器，則祗有一個空中力量，可作進攻英國的主力。空中力量對比的强弱，殆即可將這一次德國對英施用「閃電戰」的成敗，完全決定，空中力量對比之下，如果希特勒沒有絕對把握，則所謂對英「閃電戰」殆未必立即出現。</p>
<p>再觀測希特勒當前的希圖：自從去年三月，德國吞併了捷克，九月初，又完全開始了進攻波蘭；今年以來，他的武力更擴張到北歐一部及整個的西歐大陸；因之，他在目前實有其必須完成的繁重的整頓工作。在沒有整頓就緒以前，他是否集中所有力量，再到大陸對去冒險？這是一個很大的疑問！蓋向外侵略的最大目的，不外是增加自身的力量；則征服新領土後所必須倣的第一步工作，亦即在於盡量消化及吸收所吞併的國家，使自身力量漸漸膨大起來，然後再去從事新的冒險。德國目前是否已經消化而且吸收了所有被吞併國家的力量，任何人知其未然；因此之故，在牠進一步向外擴大以前，牠的當前最大工作，也就絕對不是進攻英倫三島！</p>
<p>我們總結上述的分析，最近的將來，除去英德間的空戰，或者會日見緊張外，所謂「閃電戰」也者，尙須有待吧！</p>
<h3>緬甸路被封鎖　美國堅決反對　威爾斯副卿重申立場　一般認英美在遠東應保持合作</h3>
<p>華盛頓　代理國務卿威爾斯昨日告新聞記者稱、美國政府對緬甸路之封鎖、將繼續採取堅決之反對、威雨斯吾認某記者所傳謂渠前此宜佈美政府願意與中國合法政府商討取消治外法權之舉、足以削弱美國反對封鎖緬甸路之立塲、某記者告威爾斯、謂渠前此之文告、殊爲衆人所誤解、因衆信此係政府準備讓步之表示也、威爾斯云、渠希望有機會能解釋任何誤會、渠並重申政府之意向、謂美國願意與中國合法政府於適當時期、重開取消在中國治外法權之談判云、當記者向彼詢問此舉是否美政府對緬甸路準備讓步之表示、威爾斯堅決言日、「絕對不確」、威爾斯並稱、渠並未接得任何關於日本對中國提出和平條件之報告、（三十日合衆電）</p>
<p>紐約　路透社探悉、緬甸公路封鎖之詳細經過尙未全知、惟封鎖前之事件、已遂漸有所洩露、今聞殆無可疑之消息、英方同意封鎖該路前、會商諸美國、提出等於英美政府在遠東取聯合行動之建議、兩政府固向在遠東斥資日本之侵略而援助中國者、惟此建議猝遭拒絕、英政府旣乏美國援助、乃允日方請求、無疑的觀於其在歐作生死奮鬥之地位使然也、美國於拒絕建議而英方允日本請求後、採取至少旨在間接反對日本之行動、卽以油與廢金屬歸入須領出口許可證的貨物之列是、無論此舉是否以對付日本爲目的、華盛頓各報與觀察家皆料其實行時、不啻禁運、若干觀察家現以美國何故於英國讓步後始取行動爲疑、據稱美國苟較早出此、則英國對日答覆或已不同、聞事先情勢如下、英國以日方要求通知美國、謂英國不欲允從此要求、而目前所處地位決不受任何方面之虛聲恫嚇苟獲日本如對英宣戰則美國當加以干涉之保證、英國必在遠東取堅決立塲、然赫爾雖發維持太平洋現狀之言論、而美政府並不給予此種保證、在美日方宣傳員現以英方此舉、顯欲抵消威爾斯關於在華領判權的言論之影饗爲嘗、並謂英國謀使蔣介石將軍下臺、而準備與「在政府」談判廢止領判權、今晨「華盛頓郵報」載川上一文、所發卽係上項議論、惟此間有充分證據、足證英國之地位與威爾斯今晨所表示之美國地位並無不同、卽須與衆所承認的合法中政府從事此種談判是也、據華盛頓接可恃消息、南京日方官昌新近會議時、會披露日本陸軍已大失其逼迫中政府以至傾覆之野心、日陸軍今已不無放棄在政府並以蔣介石將軍暫時退休而許重慶政府返寗之可能性、衆認此種轉變、乃日本實力减退之明證、（廿九日路透社電）</p>

<h3>美正規軍　舉行操演</h3>

<p>德國正需要巴爾幹和平</p>
<p>羅京　極富經騐之東南歐政治觀察家相信非待蘇聯下次有所行動後、所謂巴爾幹半島發展之趨勢者、必多屬揣測之辭、一般皆信蘇德互相諒解之政策、已因蘇方進佔比薩拉比亞而壽終正寢、此後蘇聯政策將以乘機行事爲主、其範圍大都視德國所行對英總攻勢之程度爲轉移、蘇聯苟已操縱保國之自由而竟不乘機凶割讓道勃魯楷事而對羅國出塲調停、藉以博取保國之格外感激、則似屬可異矣、德國聞英國近對保國要索南道勃魯楷事寄以同情、大爲激怒、故在東南歐之德方宜傳機關、乃謂英國已在巴爾幹半島開始修改疆界之煽動、藉以激起紛擾、而德國則需要巴爾幹半島之和平（卅日路透電）</p>

<h3>中英美在遠東　應維持密切合作　英隨時可取消緬甸路協定　和平問題須先得中國許可</h3>
<p>自英國政府允許日本要求、封鎖緬甸公路以來、中國方面、以英外交政策荏弱姑息、徒滋長日方無饜之慾望、同時並不能减輕英國在遠東所受之威脅、而美國朝野、對此事允感觖望、指摘言論、不絕於報章、世人至予注意、茲有本市英方觀察家頃就英國近允日本要求而封鎖緬甸公路事、發表談話、其要點如下、</p>
<p>緬甸公路隨時可開</p>
<p>（一）緬甸公路封鎖三月、純屬暫時的協定、英方保留隨時取消此協定之權、英日雙方同意之極重要條件、爲在此三閱月內、將努力獲致中日和平、卽雙方自由商取公允平等之解決、並無英國促請中國接受其感覺有害的任何條件之問題、蓋「公允平等之解決、」顯涵有須得中國許可之意也、</p>
<p>維持英美遠東合作</p>
<p>（二）中國人民應有一種印象、卽維持英美在遠東之合作、於中國最爲有利、若圖使英美不和、則非中國之利、故應培養英美之諒解、如果美政府在現况中爲甚充分之理由、感覺不宜保證在任何指明情勢中、必出何種行動、及英國若因未得美國保證而感覺以對日妥洽爲審愼之計、則中英·英美·或中美關係、亦不應因而疏遠、凡圖在中英美三方之間挑動惡感、於事無益、徒使三方地位、各受不利影響、</p>
<p>英美需要密切諒解</p>
<p>（三）英人有所批評、尤應避免指摘美國不予英國以後援、英美政府皆保留其各自行動之自由、苟雙方行動至今尚未平行、乃因各自情勢、有更强的理由所致、英美雙方需要密切諒解、此固不許受緬甸公路的決定危害者</p>
<p>訾議英國於事無補</p>
<p>（四）就他方面言、美人亦請對英方所取方針、弗加訾議、對要點未加重視、遽卽非難英國政策、悉屬無效、所謂要點者、卽英國此際勢必盡其所能、免使其在遠東之地位、趨於紛雜、蓋英國刻正在歐爲生存而戰、不能盼其隻手防衛全球各處之權利也、</p>
<p>金霍爾勸中英結盟</p>
<p>又據外人方面消息、曾任駐華英海軍武官之金霍爾、頃以通函發致各界、報道世界大局消息、內有一節述及遠東云、「吾人接訊、藉悉日人對於希特勒與墨索里尼對英國從事之大賭博、並非漠不關心之旁觀者、吾人對中國民衆抵抗日方侵略、向加重視、日人苟有圖攫香港之意、則吾人盼望中國與英聯邦結盟、中國人民素守諾言、其將在本世紀內成爲世界一大强國、毫無疑義、孔子哲學與民治生活的原則、頗多共通之點、中英如果結盟、吾人卽可以軍需供給中政府軍隊、且承認侵略終是侵略、無論其發生於歐洲或遠東、皆無區別、此等觀念當爲中國人民所歡迎、彼等固認中國不無以人力在國外參與此偉大的觀念戰爭之可能性也、</p>
<h3>馬斯南路郵局　日方昨未檢郵　乍配林返滬前不致實行　惟日人五名昨又往察閱</h3>
<p>日方企圖檢查法租界郵件、日益具　化昨日日方檢查員在馬斯南路進行佈置及若干積極性行動、致發生昨日正式開始檢查之說、實則究於何日正式開始檢查、猶未有具體認實消息也、茲誌昨日各情如次、</p>
<p>並未檢查</p>
<p>據昨日下午四時二十分、郵政管理局當局發表消息稱、外傳日方檢查員已於今日（卽昨日）在馬斯南路郵局開始正式檢查郵件之說完全不確、管理局方面、亦未接到馬斯南路支局關於郵件業已開始檢查之口頭或書面之報告、至將馬斯南路支局改爲「非投遞支局」一說、總局亦未作此考慮、</p>
<p>謠傳由來</p>
<p>惟運日日方人員赴馬斯南路郵局視察郵務管理之各種情形後、檢郵之準備工作、確已益趨具體、昨日上午八時、日人五名又赴該局、除對郵局由收受以至投遞之手續一加視察外、並入信件室、將堆置待遞之郵件、稍加翻閱、途引起外間之昨晨開始檢郵之謠傳、記者昨訪該支局當局、據稱、如日人開始檢郵、則總局方面必有訓令到達、現本人尚不知其事、則其眞實性如何、當可知之、總之在乍配林局長未抵滬前、不致開始實行、建辦公室</p>
<p>日籍檢查員將來之辦公處、經雙方商討後、現已開始布置、其地點爲該局現有辦公處之後部、因面積空曠、故須另行加製四壁、攔建成室、故原在該處辦公之郵局人員、則已遷移、至日籍檢查員人數、雖尚未確定、但當在五人與七人之間、彼等大部爲同文書院畢業、對中文有相當根柢、但對英法等文則並不熟識、可見日方此舉、純以華人及華文信件爲對象、</p>
<h3>浙閩雖遭禁航　內運繁盛　較小輪隻改航僻壤　範圍雖狹交通不斷</h3>
<p>字林報云、日海軍當局刻正竭力厲行自七月十六日起、對沿海航運所施之禁止、故若干種運滬土產、已因沿海航務停頓而見稀少、不論任何國籍之船隻、在日方禁航後賡續行駛者、</p>
<p>即遭扣留</p>
<p>聞縣葡旗之Sinta號船、近在溫州外連同船員被扣者、現已釋放、載貨返抵上海、未受損失、日海軍所施禁止、至少已使沿海航業暫無生氣、但未完全停班、確悉、今有較小之平底皓數艘、已改駛</p>
<p>長江上游</p>
<p>內地之鄉村運出棉花等貨物、而開闢新航綫、棉花運滬、每包運費高達三十五元、故若干較小航運公司、經營此業、範圍雖小、而頗繁盛、聞猪鬃亦有運來、據航運界中人稱、中國幅員廣博、不能完全終止內地航行、寗波及溫州等港僅道通入者、固可嚴格禁航、但在未遭侵佔之區、有此前不甚重要之無數鄉村皆可用作貨物往來之小口岸、</p>

<h3>英大使寇爾爵士　離滬北上避暑　前晚上輪轉赴北戴河　最短期內即重返上海</h3>
<p>英大使寇爾爵士、自於上月十五日、逾返抵上海後、原擬循例赴北戴河避暑、惟當時因遠東局勢、　爲緊張、而英大使之工作、亦頓形忙碌、以致大使北行避暑之計劃、無形打消、惟昨日一午、英大使突然離滬他往、未至大使館辦公當時知者絕少、即消息靈通之各方面、僅知大使之離滬、而不甚明瞭大使之究竟何往、據記者向各關係方面探詢結果、英大使確已離滬、而於前晚（二十九日）八時上輪、前赴威海衛、轉往北戴河、惟大使此次北上、爲日無多、將儘量縮短避暑日期、不久卽可返滬、公共租界警務處所派、西探四名、用以保護大使安全者、昨亦暫時撤去、</p>
<h3>自來火工潮　資方反提條件　慮洽卿氏昨晤嘉道利　嘉氏已拒絕工人要求</h3>
<p>關於英商自來火公局工潮、該公司董事長嘉道利證實昨日下午、虞洽卿氏曾以調人之資格、訪間嘉氏、但渠稱會談之內容詳情、目下尚未能公開發表、據消息靈通之各方面連公司在內、對於所傳工部局工業科出任調解之說、均予以吾認、虞氏昨晚接見工人代表後、或將於今晨再度與嘉氏會晤、但據昨日會晤形勢、資方除堅決拒絕勞方所提五項條件外、反向勞方提出五條、故工朝前途、尚難樂觀、</p>
<p>公司條件</p>
<p>洽卿氏昨將工人方面所提五項先決條件（已見昨報）轉達嘉氏、嘉氏表示碍難接受、並向虞氏反提五項條件、請予轉達勞方、其條件大意如次、（一）董事會不預備接受罷工要求、但彼等可遵照下列條件、如其願意、在現存基礎上回返工作、（二）本公司不預備再僱用經考慮爲不穩之工人、凡工人位置業已由他人接充、則其原有工人不再僱用、（三）罷工工人務須允許將來不再罷工、合理要求須先面呈董事會考慮、（四）僱用人員務須預備接受執行公司方面所分配之任何工作、（五）罷工人員須犧牲其怠工期內之一切薪給、上列條件、當經虞氏於昨日下午三時半轉告勞方、</p>
<p>職工會議該公司職員工人接獲此項條件後、當分別轉告全體職工、職工兩方更各個召開會議、縝密討論應付辦法、雙方分別討論後之結果、當於昨晚再行共同討論、決定一致之步驟、議至深硯方畢、據透露之消息、大的勞方將再度向虞洽卿氏請其竭力折衝、大約今日上午、勞力當派代表面謁虞氏、表示具體意見、</p>
<p>局方努力</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、　英商白來火公司之工潮、今有早　解決之可能、蓋工部　發言人今（三十日）晨宣稱、該局工業科刻正作調解此爭執之努力、頗有使罷工圓滿終止之望也、衆信工部局工業科旣從中斡旋、則雙方諒將於數日內舉行會談、目下目來火公司雇用臨時人員約一百名、多係白俄及德籍猶太難民、彼等雖努力工作、然自來火供給已較常時大减、允以法租界方面之自來火供給、已减至不足三分之一、</p>

<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近升一八七五、遠漲〇六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美不動、對滬亦平、美對英長半分、對滬小二分、對法無市、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士八七五、美滙六元〇六二五、較之上日晚收、英美兩滙俱平、開後缺乏買戶、先令曾告三便士八九〇六二五、嗣港電來扒本月份先令、計荷蘭及東亞塞予爲三便士八七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉增百分之一·二五、此後市面平穩、計投機商美行售予有利安達等本月份美滙仍六元〇六二五、但至十時半後、洋行忽又入市結進、本月份美滙價、稍趨軟化、時吃入外行美滙價由六元〇六二五、至〇三一二五、又扒下月份美滙價爲六元、惟迄午收、爲狀尚平、結果英金三便士八七五、美滙六元〇三一二五、比晨開英平美微緊〇三一二五、</p>
<p>美滙六元收盤</p>
<p>午後漸勢緊俏、乃因謠傳日軍海防登陸、又謂重慶中央銀行掛牌减低、是於洋行猛結、投機商亦來扒進、初美行賣與有利本月份美滙六元〇三一二五、後洋行入美行則告六元、至八月份華商投機家與洋行吃進大陸沙遜爲五元九六八七五、迨至晚收、尚乏變化、結果英金三便士八五九三七五、美滙六元、九月份英金三便士八四三七五、美滙五元九六八七五、計較上日晚收、英金期現均縮〇一五六二五、美匯現緊〇六二五、期貨縮〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>外幣漲風益熾</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤漲風加厲、英美金鎊、因亦上漲神速、結果各升二元五角、英金票需要不寂、價漲三角、美金票以黑市美匯已縮至六元關、午後更有利多傳說、致買氣大盛、晚市高至十六元七角半、比上日續漲三角、香港票隨港滬匯兌上漲一分、日金票及朝鮮票需要愈殷、市價一致挺漲、前者高至一元二角五分、後者高至一元零八分半、</p>
<h3>七月份匯劃存息　每千元六元</h3>
<p>上海市銀行業聯合準備委員會、訂定七月份同業滙劃存款息、爲每千元六元、（卽合月息六釐）較上月减低一元五角、</p>
<h3>證券　內外債跌</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、爲連第九期利息最後一日、市况居然稍起回風、市氣頓轉虛餒、市上謠日攻越南、金子大漲、人心愈覺不振、今日起除利息計算、查利息實收二元八角半、但需分六期收取、故實合二元七角左右、故除利息計算、市價應接此類算合、前途因失去利息之維繫、或將稍回鬆、昨日交易、上午卽見不支、多方頻頻塞出、午後賣氣更濃、乙種打破四元、丙種亦破入二元關、市氣頓虛、各戶進出以長春同康及三十八號始終買進、餘如公茂德孚仁昌信孚等均有需要、但賣氣較盛、如　益鴻　鴻大益昌生大　大以及六十四號等不斷出籠、或現貨流出、故多方始終未能抬頭、其中以丁種交易稀少、市價尚能立定、餘則一致回小二角至三角半、成交總數約計一百十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>沒票交易、成效新公司股一百股、價爲九元半、眾業公所昨日股市、動盪不定、大抵爲各種消息所左右、開盤市况呆滯帶軟、嗣略回高、終因消息傳來、謂荷印政府對於出口橡皮·錫·及油等、除現行稅則外、將加徵百分之五稅率、價格立又趨軟、下午緊俏之外滙、對於股市、顯有助力、收盤人心極佳、</p>
<p>倫敦二十九日（週一）電今日中國外債及遠東英南各公　股票掛牌行市、中國外債稍見疲發以落、計英法借款英發債票跌五鎊、價爲三十五鎊、　廣鐵路借款非　發債票跌二鎊、京滬鐵路公債跌一鎊、價均爲十二鎊、其餘不動、股票大體平定、僅麥加利銀行股績漲二先令六便士、價爲六鎊十五先令、餘無榮辱、</p>
<h3>倫敦鐵路公債　明日開始付息</h3>
<p>倫敦般訊、滙豐銀行通告、一八九九年關內外鐵路公債、（卽北寗鐵路公債）、第三十六次還本抽籤、業於六月十四日在倫敦舉行、計抽出債票英金五萬七千五百鎊、現定八月一日開始償還、又第八十二期到期息票、合計息金英金七千一百八十八鎊、亦定於同日開付云、</p>
<h3>糧食　又有五萬包洋米到　市價被鎭壓難抬頭　粳米獨上漲兩元許</h3>
<p>現洋米市自前午一度轉堅後、昨晨初開、賣猶圍扳持、若一號陳西貢至五十三四元、火絞五十一二元、無如銷塲不佳、作客見來源不斷、存底豐足、勢無高漲之可能、市面不軟不已、一軟人心即餒、雖喊聲步步回低、卒難引起買氣、結果遂以平疲見稱、計收盤一號陳西貢仍爲五十一二元、路貨早市一度回好半元、旋即一路下遊、蓋存底過多、人心虛弱、稍漲卽落、終難持久、路貨已到即交之　米二號早開五十八元半、似可與現米同時站定、不料新囤絕跡、抵空觀望、而力薄之行號浮囤散客則不肯再度堅守、隨卽貶價求脫、價卽自五十八元、五十七元五六角、五十七元、小至五十六元半、反比前收小一元半、西貢二號七月上裝初開五十七元、旋自五十六元半小至五十五元半、則比前開五十九元之價較小有三元半、六月份裝小絞開五十八元半及五十八元、後亦以進戶還小未續開出、而成交數則有四百多噸、現米五千包、江北秈新到二千包、因洋米價小衹開四十七元半至四十七元云、</p>
<p>洋米大量接踵而來、昨日又有太古公司濟南輪到滬、由香港運來一萬二千零六包、寗海輪同時到埠、亦自香港裝來一萬三千九百三十一包、　輪均停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、另有高登洋行經理之挪威輪Herlaik號、直接由西貢裝來二萬五千餘包、昨日是下午五時抵埠、停靠浦東其昌棧起　、</p>
<p>糯米雖屬不多、但受洋糯相軋、致仍難以立足、見貶元　、聞金　　元五十六七元、常丹白元五十四五元、香港白元五十五元、次至五十三元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等　米、以　來到貨時斷時續、傳聞塲外暗盤、當洋米緊漲之際人心堅昂、或交頗夥、售價得獨囘高二元左右、常　鮮淸粳六十五元半、六十五元、無錫淸粳六十四元、常州　　粳六十二三元、次至六十元、宿五十八元左右、靑泗薄稻六十四五元、至六十二三元、南港鮮高斛早稻五十八元半、五十八元云云、</p>
<h3>南洋粉銷微動</h3>
<p>麵粉</p>
<p>昨日交易略見活動、蓋自二號粉廠改爲十五元後、一部份搭用雜牌粉者、均改辦廠粉、故兩廠批出數量、續增至六千包左右、且南洋幫亦以廠盤較　、進胃微動、計開天竹牌等二三千包、價爲十六元、其他日廠粉與內地粉供求兩寂、鳳凰牌價衹十三元五角、仍乏正式成交、</p>
<p>小麥</p>
<p>昨小麥市况、仍居　局、蓋緣邇日虹口閘北等處到存雖充、而售價已被日廠抑低不少、貨方以運輸手續艱難、大都不願再事貶說、故全日間除華廠略有收進一二千包外、其餘均乏做開、價扯二十元零六五角</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗產消　不能平衡　雙馬回跌餘元</h3>
<p>連漲兩日之紗市、昨則又復回挫、實因實銷未見大量發展、所以新買風未起、且連日收進之大戶、因其價格旣漲高、亦停止吸進、於此檯面稍滯、卽轉下風、有一部份獲利者活動吐出、因之市盤又復下挫矣、根問題、還是存貨日增、生產與消費不能平衡也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、多頭人氣做作熱烈之象、叫聲高昂、實際上價格抬高之後、方可出檔、　　　者缺乏、一　　　之　戶、鑒於　於　環境之下、無　　　　之希望、所抱之慾望不大、一看千元關口、　力穿出、　爭出　　　、因　　　反　下風、開價爲九百八十五元、叫喊多時、未見新價、回跌至九百七十五元、然收盤以後、　至九百六十八元、查半日間成交統計一千八百十五包、行情二十支雙馬跌十餘元、今日有紗七十件運海口、九百五十件運香港、一百四十件運廈門、茲將各幫口買去額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　一、二五〇　香港　五三五</p>
<p>廈門　一〇　內地　二〇</p>
<p>統計　一、八二五</p>
<h3>日廠减工　棉市愈弱</h3>
<p>現棉情形又入呆滯之途、廠方依然巨量辦胃、實則紗市不能積極上升、對於原料乏意抵補、至於日廠偶有添辦、然付款期限、仍要遲緩一月、而海外來源絡績不絕、所以棉市在此短期間、無大生望也、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初先因現貨高之　出、後因南方幫　　　、　果收　價格、較之上日跌落三　　、印度　市昨日連同預測跌三羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊見靜寂、各方俱以月終關係、咸抱觀望態度、日廠因存底不豐、紗銷呆滯、聞有减工之說、同業間交易甚稀也、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆新陳不接　市面俏利非凡</h3>
<p>黃豆市面則因陳貨已枯、新貨尚未登塲、而銷路還有、致在此新陳代謝之際、俏俐局面、異常牢硬、一般所存之貨、在昔以爲次貨者、今則視爲身份高貴、依然有奇貨自居矣、昨由汕頭廈門　州本街等辦去安慶豆一千餘包、價爲二十八元五角至二十九元七角、蚌埠豆三百餘包、價爲二十六元五角八分、浦東社豆五十包、價爲二十九元七角、崇明沙黃六十包、價爲二十六元、又今日有豆子三千七百包運廈門、又九百五十包運香港、生仁二百七十包同運港、生油　百五十　、高　三百　、均運廈門</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球一漲再漲　每噸又加八元</h3>
<p>煤球行情、日前自公會　　　頓行盤以來、昨又無　　加八元、計開義泰興、南洋、　　煤球、同業自車、每　一百　　元、送到一百廿六元、　街門莊零售、每担六元八角、較昨又加起四角云、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷糖報漲</h3>
<p>昨日糖市公會劃盤、二四粗白本棧貨六十七元、外棧貨六十五元七角、六十五元八角、六十六元、下午因荷蘭來電粗砂報漲、（十一元一角二分半）人心轉佳、故外棧貨討六十七元、但未成交、轉口貨五十二元二角、太古B嘜三月份到陳貨七十一元五角、西棧新　七十一元八角、昨日廣幫開出東鄉赤普通貨二百包、價爲五十二元、昨由香港來糖五千七百十包、</p>

<p>黔省开礦</p>
<p>肇元以黔省砂礦豐富，上奏朝廷，擬從事開採，以富國裕民，其奏　謂：　黔省跬步皆山，磅薄積鬰之氣，應產各色砂礦，乃從前各廠，業已洞老山空，苦無富商另來開採，蓋以寶藏於地，不能操必得之權，人多難疑，卒少舉辦。臣前在藩司任內，曾經詳定章程，出示招商辦理，而應者寥寥，又復遴委熟悉礦務員紳，分投履勘，間有產礦之地，又無開礦之資遂至事多中輟。現在協餉不濟，窘局日危，不得不於無可籌　之中，冀或稍收自然之利。茲查有歸化通判羅解州判交轄之馬鞍大寳崖頭沙溝等山，砂氣頗旺，而四面峰巒，中環一水，於民間田園廬墓，毫無關碍，擬卽由官先行試辦，以期有力紳商，開風興起。臣謹與司道，商動閒款，委員督辦，派勇彈壓，倘能仰荷朝廷福澤，山川效靈，辦有成效，除變價提充正餉外，仍奏明照例　課，以裕庫儲。抑或辦無成效，亦卽停工，免滋糜費，臣不敢惜慘淡經營之力，因瘠土闕財，事非獲已。」云云。</p>

<h3>理智與情感的搏鬭</h3>
<p>— 人韋</p>
<p>據二十七日報載：有上海人金鴻才者，因失業已久，生計無着，妻子因而出走，而他却把一個三歲女孩投入江中，（想减輕負擔吧？）但技巧不精，被碼頭小工察覺，結果被抓到捕房里去，判徒刑二年幾個月。</p>
<p>妻子因丈夫失業而不能滿意，於是由口角而出走，另覓蹊踁；父親因自己沒有飯吃，管不得小孩，因之就拋了她；原來人類的感情是建築在實際生活上的，還是望着丈夫活活地餓死？還是離了丈夫去找生路？還是抱着小孩一同死亡？還是丟了小孩去討飯吃？</p>
<p>這同前幾年叫川災荒的情境是相同的：父親要殺死兒子來飽腹，兒子要殺父親來充飢。</p>
<p>是的，人類來到世界上是爲了活，這是情感。但當這世界不能滿足他的時候，他還是要想盡法子來活，管不得父母，兒女，管不得恐怖，死亡……一切。</p>
<p>這是理智與情感的搏鬬！</p>
<p>請允許我留一條尾巴，現在這位金鴻才者，已經有飯吃了，在二年幾個月之內。</p>
<h3>學徒的幸福</h3>
<p>— 曹靈佑</p>
<p>說到了學徒的幸福，一定有許多人來非議我這句話，學徒有什麼幸福可言呢？天天幹着那些卑賤的工作，每月的收入還不够買日常生活必需品，還須受那老闆的脾氣，常常遭遇他的白眼，處在學徒的境地裏，眞是過着非人的生活，幸福在那裏呢？你說學徒的幸福，難道是瘋了嗎？不過我說學徒的幸福，是有些理由的。古語有云：歲寒然後知松柏之後凋，可見愈是惡劣的環境，奮鬬出來而成功的，愈配稱爲人世間之英雄好漢。現在的社會中，更不知有幾許成功的人，是由學徒升到老闆，其奮鬬之過程，實足欽佩！學徒的生活，誠然是非常痛苦，但假如學徒肯不自暴自棄，努力奮發，那麼成功楚在目前的。</p>
<p>假如你常翻閱世界名人傳記時，那你更會相信學徒是幸福了。古今一般成功的名人，不知有多少是從學徒出身的，他們在學徒的時期，正磨煉了堅强的意志，雄壯的魄力，一遇機會到的時候，他們就顯身手揚眉吐氣，迭福人羣，成爲世界名人。我可隨便舉幾位名人的事實來證明一下：</p>
<p>發明家愛迪生恐怕誰人都認識了。他發明了許多的東西，增加了世界的文明。但他少時却是非常貧困，十多歲的時候，他在他表兄的工塲中做事，受盡表兄的虐待，因而他出走了。過着悲苦的失業生活。剛巧碰着一個好的機會，市塲中」副計數器損壞了，旁的人都束手無策，但他却把它修好了。結果得到了市塲中經理的贊許，僱他爲副工程司，從此愛迪生就一路風順，生活就有着落，卒成世界發明大王。</p>
<p>第二位我所想說的，是一位世界聞名的歷史學家威爾斯。他亦是一位妻人之子，少時在一家小雜貨店當學徒，黎明卽起，昏夜始寢，終日操着掃地揩窗的苦役。但後來肆志力學，奮進不懈，成爲舉世聞名的學者。</p>
<p>美國的富蘭克林，恐怕許多人都讀過他的自傳，年少的時候，他在其兄的印刷店中當學徒，他自己忙中偷閒，潛修典藉，卒成一位文學家，政治家，兼科學家。</p>
<p>我要列舉上述三位偉人的</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>霍桑好像受了我的誘引，果眞舉出了一點。他道：「這女子怎麼會有這許多錢，我也得向安娜問一問。」我道：「這也算要點？伊的錢不是有那個寃桶陸健笙抱腰嗎？</p>
<p>霍桑等了一等，微微搖一搖頭。「我不相信這個寃桶會寃到如此程度。」</p>
<p>「何以見得？」</p>
<p>「他最近小是已知道了趙伯雄跟王麗蘭有勾搭嗎？我猜想伊和余甘棠的關係，他也未必會全然不知。」</p>
<p>我不禁笑道：「霍桑，你的心理研究固然是很精深的，可是據我看來，却還像『萬寳全書缺隻角。」</p>
<p>這時霍桑突然把汽車煞住。我抬頭一瞧，，知車路中心的紅燈亮了。等到汽車繼續進行的當兒，他的談話也居然有繼續的餘興。</p>
<p>他問我道：「這話什麼意思？」他的頭不住向馬路的兩旁瞭望。我答道：「你對於『寃桶心理』的研究，似乎還欠透澈。上海儘多這樣的大人物。他們一方面仲出了魔爪，壓榨平民的汗血，一方面却去盡力揮霍在女人身上。他們明知他們的外室或不合法的同居者在外面勾勾搭搭，他們却仍能保持着那種眼開眼閉的『紳士丰度』，而鞠躬盡瘁地報効。其實這也就是『悖人悖出』的定律！」</p>
<p>霍桑好像沒有聽得，自言自語地說：「唉，這就是嵩山路——那高房子大概就是康寗公寓罷？」</p>
<p>兩秒鐘後，我們汽車已在那宅八層高的巨厦面前停住。霍桑先跳下車去，一直進那公寓的門房裏去。等我將車門關好，走上石階，他從門房裏出來，領我走進電梯間去。他說道：「我已問過，姜安娜在樓上。」</p>
<p>「那是當然的。伊不是說過昨夜伊一夜沒睡嗎？」</p>
<p>電梯升到了三層樓上，我們跨出電梯間時，我忽然想起了一件事，舉起手來瞧瞧我的手表。（六一）事蹟，無非是要來證明做學徒的人，實在不應太悲觀，應當抓住忍耐的機會，奮力的工作，則總有成功之一日。許許多多的名人不是從學徒出身嗎？所謂有爲者，亦若是，深望那些爲學徒的人，把自己看作是幸福的。有人說了一句很有意義的話，他說：「不幸而生爲官家子弟，彷彿是被載上了重量而賽跑的人。」這句話反面，却說着貧困是幸福，學徒是幸福！</p>
<h3>想到·看到·聽到</h3>
<p>— 維康</p>
<p>爲了百物飛漲，人人都處處打算，速寫封信也不得不用明信片了，因爲寫信一次（本埠）郵票要二分，信封二分，信紙一分，就得要五分，但用明信片就只要一分錢就行了。所以郵局明信片生意興隆，但每次每人最多以上張爲限，多則不售，以稍限制。</p>
<p>在某報的廣告欄中看到了一則尋狗的廣告，大意說：走失小白色哈叭狗一頭，設有人尋獲送回，賞洋一百元。同時在此欄中，又看到一則招尋小孩酬洋五元的廣告，令人有「人不如狗」之歎了。</p>
<h3>急救時疫</h3>

<h3>我之李盛藻觀</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>李翰儒（盛藻）爲富連成科社之傑出人才，該社鬚生一行，自馬連良譚富英以後，藝術優秀而享譽最隆者，亦惟翰儒一人。翰儒之藝，大致學連良，唱做均有似處，甘露寺之喬玄一角，學馬更爲肖妙，不但唱腔從同，卽神情動作，亦無一不似，此其聰明過人有以致之，非常人强學所能得到者也。當其第一次來滬時，（搭天蟾舞台，同來者皆富社盛字輩子弟。）愚觀其劇者凡十餘次，爾時翰儒齒尚穉，而其演藝已非常老到，與陳盛蓀合演「四郎探母，」與劉盛蓮合演「坐樓殺惜，」唱做俱佳，予觀衆以極良好之印象，愚尤劇賞共與盛蓮合演「四進士」一折，蓋童伶演此類做工戲，往往失之於生硬枯澀，而翰儒演來，則頭頭是道，且能將惡訟師之姿態與手段盡量烘托而出，斯爲可貴也已。第二次再度南來，搭黃金大戲院，資格益見老練，藝亦隨之而俱進，惟以配角稍見軟弱，未能展其所長，此係當時事實，愚寧敢爲翰儒諱？北歸以後，自挑大樑，求精之心乃益切，切磋琢磨，惟善是從，孜孜矻矻，勤學不輟，蓋其藝已進於道矣。此次捲土重來，正有心人立業樹功之時，兼之坤旦童芷苓，爲一初發於硎之新伶，武生高盛麟，更是紥下紅底之名角，有此二人爲之輔佐，其演出之精彩，與收成之美滿，自可不言而喻。况有其泰山高慶奎與之俱來，擔任把塲而外，兼作臨時導師，其於演出方面，自更多一種意外之幫助，登台有日，愚當刮目俟之。</p>
<h3>李綺年給愛護者的總答復</h3>
<p>李綺年昨有函致海星社，略謂渠自來滬後，接到愛護者之函件甚多，所提問題中，以下列三個爲最普遍，茲以答復寄上，請予轉發各報，以作一總答復。</p>
<p>（一）一聞女士來滬前曾赴新加坡登台演出，詳情可見告吾？」</p>
<p>答：「赴新加坡係往馬來亞半島演唱中之一過程，在馬來亞半島經過二十餘城市，平均每處的作三五日或一二日之勾留，此行係應邵氏兄弟公司之聘，沿途間亦登台演唱籌款賑濟難民，差幸成績尚佳，前後爲時兩個月。」</p>
<p>（一）「南洋方面電影事業情形如何？」</p>
<p>答：『南洋爲國片海外之極佳市塲，每一影片問世，均可抓取廣大觀衆，故製片家如能供給有意義之出品，定可收極大之宣傳效果。』</p>
<p>（三）「女士對於上海盛行之民問故事電影有何意見？」</p>
<p>答：『此次來滬後，已承電影刊物數家以此問題作書面詢問，民間故事電影，初未加以注意，過去亦未演過此類影片，此次藝華當局送來交余選擇之劇本十餘部中，亦未見有此類劇本，故不能申述任何意見。』</p>
<h3>返滬後之　章遏雲</h3>
<p>— 梅雨</p>
<p>珠塵館主章遏雲，客臘輟演後，鑒於滬濱處境特殊，爰偕孟小冬南游香港，以資小憇，不意驚訊頻傳，山雨欲來，</p>
<p>革命先鋒，由約翰韋恩，克蘭屈勒佛主演，情節緊張刺激，到處自由呼聲，充滿民族精神，爲美國獨立運動之先聲。</p>
<h3>怎樣拍攝電影？　（二）</h3>
<p>— 德綱</p>
<p>怎樣開始攝片在拍片之前，當然先定劇本。劇本的種類很多，有喜劇，悲劇，社會性劇，歷史劇，宗敎性劇等等。導演影片的人選定了劇本後，便須將這蘊藏在理想中空洞的劇情，變成一有聲有色的實物。扭任導演是一件艱苦的工作，所以有人說一部名片的成功，並不是主演明星的功績，而應歸功於導演。導演的第一步工作，便是依據各演員的個性和才能，分派担任劇中不同的角色，而後定製佈景。用在攝影塲中的佈景，較普通舞台用的佈景考究得多，因爲開麥拉的鏡頭如同一隻精細的眼一樣，對於任何最小的一點，都不肯輕易忽略過。怖景的構造也山專家担任，他們能利用紙和木，製成各式各樣的東西，或者笨重的巨砲，威武的戰艦，巍峨的宮廷大厦等。佈景等都備妥後，便可開始攝片。在攝片時，導演先生便目不轉瞬指揮工作，校正演員的表情，姿勢，動作，對白等，尤其是動作，一般無經騐的演員，一舉一動總嫌太快，不能合於拍戲的要求。因爲太快的動作在影片中給觀衆看時，好像都是斷續的動作，不甚美妙。</p>
<p>在一張影片中，時常有很多節幕，都在同一地點，或同一佈景下舉行。爲節省人力和物力起見，各佈景地點相同，而次序不連的節幕，可在同時拍攝，而後把這些不連貫的節幕片子剪開，待攝畢其他各節幕時，再用膠水將各片挨次序先後相速接。在攝片時，儘管導演是何等的注意，演員等是何等的努力，但攝畢後總有許多節的片子不能使人滿意，而需剪去重拍。所以剪下重拍的片長，每較木片長好多倍。例如一張在電影放映時長爲一千八百或二千公尺的片子，此片在攝製時，起碼長一萬公尺，你想片子的損失，是何等的浩大！</p>
<p>香島亦非樂土，祇得重圖歸計，買棹返中，業於日前安抵上海，仍卜居於福煦路畔。遏雲自返滬後，與外界殊鮮往返。暇輒讀書寫字以自遣，劇本方面惟對玉霜之作「燕子箋」稍予涉獵。月內或將返至西子湖濱，小居數旬，乃再遠去津沽，演劇與否，再作定論。</p>
<h3>簡訊</h3>
<p>工華劇團（卽工部局華員俱樂部的話劇股），正籌備公演李健吾的三幕劇「這不過是春天」，導演山鄭通担任，不久定期公演。（二）莊嚴主編之影藝畫報，第七期已出版，內容豐美，消息獨特，零售每冊三角，各處均售。（三）影迷服務社所出各種明星照片，各報攤書局均有代理，每三張或四張分一組，價二角五分，五洲書報社總代理。（四）醞釀已久之中國實騐劇團，爲滬上一規模較大陣容整齊之業餘劇團，近據該團發起諸君告記者，謂已開始工作，刻正擬向某劇院接洽，以便作有定期之經常演出云。</p>
<h3>彈詞二十種（十六）再生緣</h3>
<p>— 凍雲撰文　烟製圖</p>
<p>再生緣是叙述皇甫少華和孟麗君一對多情兒女的患難因緣。</p>
<p>「好事」照例是「多磨」的。皇甫少華與孟麗君在多難的環境中嘗遍了不少的艱苦和磨折</p>
<p>以「大團圓爲結束，似乎已成了彈詞小說的呆板公式（紅樓夢西廂記的能够深入人心，正因其此等處不落常套也）。「再生緣」當然未能免俗。</p>
<p>結構略爲散漫，譜諸管弦，似乎不大容易討好。</p>

<h3>Anhui-South Chinese Army Recovers Chaoxian County; Chinese Guerrillas Extremely Active Near Beiping; Yongdingmen Attacked Several Times, Japanese Greatly Disturbed</h3>
<p>Tunxi</p>
<p>On the 21st, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Chaoxian County, with a momentum like a tide. They immediately approached the southeastern suburbs and charged valiantly. The battle continued until the evening of the 23rd, when they stormed into the city. The Chinese army wielded their swords and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. The remaining Japanese broke through and fled, and Chaoxian County was declared recovered. (Dated the 30th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Prospects of the Anglo-German War</h3>
<p>There is no hope of reconciliation between Britain and Germany, at least in the near future. As for the manner in which the war will begin, it is likely that Germany will launch a Hitler-style, storm-like "Blitzkrieg" to swiftly crush the resistance of the British Isles and conquer them, so that Hitler can complete his plan to control all of Europe before other international developments affect the course of the war.</p>
<p>Let us examine this issue from two perspectives: First, what is the possibility of implementing a so-called "Blitzkrieg" against Britain? Second, what does Germany hope to achieve in the next stage of the overall European war?</p>
<p>The so-called "Blitzkrieg," as defined by Hitler himself, consists of only two points: (1) To wage war at a moment's notice, catching the enemy off guard. To suddenly start operations like lightning when the enemy is most lax and inattentive. (2) To concentrate forces and strike the enemy's most fatal weakness first, and to repeatedly strike that weakness as heavily as possible. For example, in last year's Polish campaign, even at the very last moment before the war, the Polish authorities believed that Germany would never dare to provoke a large-scale European war. Therefore, assuming that Poland was determined to resist, they concluded that Hitler had absolutely no courage to attack Poland. As a result, they played diplomatic games as much as possible, using various methods to mock Germany, while on the other hand, they completely displayed a state of unserious laxity. Hitler targeted this phenomenon and launched an eleven-pronged general attack on Poland, reaping the first triumph of the "Blitzkrieg" tactic. Another example is the recent French campaign. Originally, France's most fatal weakness in this war was the absolute inferiority of its human resources. Hitler seized upon this weakness of France, concentrated his land and air forces, and surged forward rapidly, forcing France to make an immediate decision, exposing this inferiority of France immediately. As a result, the "Blitzkrieg" tactic achieved its hoped-for victory for the second time. As for the upcoming campaign against Britain, Britain will not be caught off guard as Poland was, but Britain is still at an absolute disadvantage in terms of the quantity, equipment, and training of its army. If Germany can force the British army to engage in immediate decisive battle, Germany may be able to win in the shortest period. However, between the European continent and the British Isles lies an ocean. In the process of Germany crossing the sea to attack, it must first encounter the British navy. A comparison of naval power reveals Germany's greatest weakness. If Hitler has no so-called secret weapon, then only air power can be the main force for attacking Britain. The relative strength of air power will likely determine the success or failure of this German "Blitzkrieg" against Britain. If Hitler does not have absolute confidence in the relative strength of air power, then the so-called "Blitzkrieg" against Britain may not appear immediately.</p>
<p>Furthermore, observing Hitler's current ambitions: Since March of last year, when Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, and at the beginning of September, when it fully launched its attack on Poland, his military power has expanded to parts of Northern Europe and the entire Western European continent this year. As a result, he currently has a heavy task of consolidation that must be completed. Before consolidation is complete, will he concentrate all his forces and venture again on the continent? This is a big question! The greatest purpose of foreign aggression is nothing more than to increase one's own strength. The first step to be imitated after conquering new territories is to digest and absorb the annexed countries as much as possible, so that one's own strength gradually expands, and then engage in new adventures. Whether Germany has already digested and absorbed the strength of all the annexed countries is something that anyone knows is not the case. Therefore, before it expands further outward, its greatest current task is definitely not to attack the British Isles!</p>
<p>We conclude the above analysis by saying that in the near future, apart from the air war between Britain and Germany, which may become increasingly tense, the so-called "Blitzkrieg" still needs to wait!</p>
<h3>Burma Road Blockade Firmly Opposed by the United States; Undersecretary Welles Reaffirms Position; General Opinion is that Britain and America Should Maintain Cooperation in the Far East</h3>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>Acting Secretary of State Welles told reporters yesterday that the US government will continue to take a firm stand against the blockade of the Burma Road. Welles believed that a reporter's claim that he had previously announced that the US government was willing to discuss with the legitimate government of China the abolition of extraterritorial rights, would weaken the US's opposition to the blockade of the Burma Road. The reporter told Welles that his previous statement was widely misunderstood, as many believed it was a sign that the government was preparing to compromise. Welles said that he hoped to have the opportunity to explain any misunderstanding. He also reiterated the government's intention that the US is willing to reopen negotiations with the legitimate government of China on the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China at the appropriate time. When a reporter asked him if this was a sign that the US government was preparing to compromise on the Burma Road, Welles firmly said, "Absolutely not true." Welles also said that he had not received any reports regarding Japan's peace terms to China. (United Press dispatch, dated the 30th)</p>
<p>New York</p>
<p>Reuters has learned that the detailed circumstances of the Burma Road blockade are not yet fully known, but events prior to the blockade have gradually been revealed. It is now heard that there is no doubt that before the British agreed to block the road, they consulted with the United States and proposed a joint action by the British and American governments in the Far East. Both governments have been investing in the Far East to counter Japan's aggression and aid China, but this proposal was abruptly rejected. The British government, lacking American aid, then granted the Japanese request, undoubtedly due to its position of fighting for life and death in Europe. After the US rejected the proposal and the British granted the Japanese request, the US took actions that were at least aimed at indirectly opposing Japan, namely, classifying oil and scrap metal as goods requiring export licenses. Regardless of whether this move was intended to deal with Japan, Washington newspapers and observers all expected it to be tantamount to an embargo when implemented. Some observers are now wondering why the US only took action after Britain conceded. It is said that if the US had acted earlier, Britain's response to Japan might have been different. The situation beforehand was as follows: Britain notified the US of Japan's demands, stating that Britain did not want to comply with these demands, and its current position would not be subject to intimidation from any party, unless Japan declared war on Britain, in which case the US would intervene as a guarantee. Britain would take a firm stance in the Far East, but while Hull made statements about maintaining the status quo in the Pacific, the US government did not provide such guarantees. Japanese propagandists in the US are now attempting to portray this move by Britain as an attempt to counteract the impact of Welles' comments on consular jurisdiction in China, and claiming that Britain is seeking to remove General Chiang Kai-shek and preparing to negotiate the abolition of consular jurisdiction with the "puppet government." This morning, the "Washington Post" published an article by Kawakami, which expressed the same arguments. However, there is ample evidence here to prove that Britain's position is no different from the US position expressed by Welles this morning, namely, to engage in such negotiations with the legitimate government of China recognized by all. According to reliable sources in Washington, at a recent meeting of Japanese officials in Nanjing, it was revealed that the Japanese army had largely lost its ambition to force the Chinese government to collapse. The Japanese army is now considering abandoning the puppet government and allowing the Chongqing government to return to Nanjing, with General Chiang Kai-shek temporarily retiring. It is widely believed that this shift is a clear sign of the decline of Japanese power. (Reuters dispatch, dated the 29th)</p>

<h3>US President Requests Authorization to Call Up National Guard for Full Training to Cope with World Crisis</h3>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>President Roosevelt yesterday again requested Congress to authorize the call-up of the National Guard, and stressed that Congress must grant the President this power. If this power is granted to the President, the President can make more than 250,000 National Guardsmen serve for a year of active duty. Well-informed sources believe that President Roosevelt's purpose is clearly: (1) To have the National Guard engage in combat training so that it can supplement the regular army in the event of war; (2) To enable the US to send a large part of the regular army to overseas areas to train the National Guard and engage in the defense of important areas such as the Far East.

<h3>United States Accelerates Great Defense Program; Building Factories, Improving Army Equipment, Forming Air Raid Warning Teams Stationed in Various Locations</h3>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>The US War Department announced last night that the value of the contracts signed by the Department has exceeded US$17 million. These contracts are part of the equipment and construction of the War Department's Great Defense Program. The largest contract is with the Diesel Engine Division of General Motors Corporation of Texas to build engines for medium tanks for the Army, worth US$3 million. Other contracts for building trucks, communication equipment, and other machinery have also been signed. According to well-informed sources, the US War Department will also allocate US$5.2 million from the US$220 million approved by Congress for the construction of necessary factories to build a factory for manufacturing searchlights and anti-aircraft gun reflectors, and has selected a location near Cincinnati for the factory. The first factory to be prepared by the Army is the smokeless powder factory, with a budget of US$30 million. The factory site is in Hamilton, Indiana, and will be built by DuPont Nemours Company. Another 106 factories of the same type are also planned to be built and are currently under consideration by the War Department. Yesterday, the Army also announced that it is preparing to establish four air raid warning teams. This design is the first step in consolidating the coastal defense plan. With the establishment of this organization, in the event of an air raid, a simple order can be issued to directly activate interceptors and anti-aircraft guns to counter the air raid. The first team will have 250 personnel and will be stationed in Mitchel Field, New York, Houston, Texas, and California. The War Department also plans to establish six such teams along the Atlantic coast, one team in the Gulf of Mexico, three teams in the Pacific, and teams will also be established in Alaska, Hawaii, Panama, and Puerto Rico in sequence.

<h3>The Outcome of British Concessions to Japan: Anti-British Sentiment in Japan Intensifies; Using the Pretext of Suppressing Espionage, Many Foreigners are Arrested; This Japanese Move Clearly Carries Political Significance</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to Japanese sources, at today's cabinet meeting, Army Minister Tojo gave a detailed report on the death of Reuters correspondent in Tokyo, Cox, and on "the British espionage network in Japan." After the cabinet meeting, Tojo, Navy Minister Yoshida, and Foreign Minister Matsuoka exchanged views on various pending diplomatic issues. Subsequently, Matsuoka also met with Prime Minister Konoe to discuss the diplomatic actions to be taken regarding the "British espionage case." At the same time, there were reports of arrests of "foreign spies" in Kurume, Kyushu, and Keijo, Korea. According to Japanese sources, a spokesman for the Kurume military police stated that since the outbreak of the China Incident, they have been closely monitoring foreign espionage activities. As of July 27, several foreign spies have been arrested because their actions have become quite active since the international situation changed, and they can no longer be ignored. All those arrested are currently being interrogated in both Shimonoseki and Kurume. The report also stated that according to a telephone call from Keijo, Korea, the Korean Army and the prosecutor's office issued a joint statement at 3:00 PM today, stating that the Korean Army had arrested several foreign spies in a nationwide crackdown on foreign espionage and are currently interrogating them. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: After Japanese newspapers reported the large-scale arrest of British nationals in Japan on charges of espionage, they today denounced Britain for engaging in large-scale espionage activities in Japan. The "Nichinichi Shimbun" stated that Britain used its unprecedented propaganda and conspiracies in the last World War to make Germany surrender. Since the outbreak of this European war, Britain has exerted considerable effort in propaganda in Japan and has been carrying out activities to create a fifth column. Its objectives are threefold: (1) to create public opinion in Japan to induce Japan to join the European war on the British side; (2) to prevent Japan from providing military or material assistance to Germany and Italy; and (3) to obstruct the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. The "Asahi Shimbun" accused Britain of planting a systematic network of propaganda and conspiracy organs within Japan, stating that there are 200 banks and other commercial establishments within Japan with capital of 50,000 yuan or more that are affiliated with British financiers. There are 30 associations and clubs under British influence, and 200 churches presided over by British nationals. The "Hochi Shimbun" claimed that British religious groups and educational institutions in Japan are all performing the functions of a fifth column. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Arrest of British Nationals: Britain Lodges a Protest with Japan; Ambassador Craigie Visited Matsuoka Yesterday, Stating that British Nationals in Japan Have No Political Activities</h3>
<p>London: Reuters diplomatic correspondent has just obtained information from responsible sources here that British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka yesterday to lodge a protest regarding the arrest of British nationals in Japan. It is reported that the British Ambassador pointed out that the British side will take a serious view of this action, and it is possible that strict views may be taken elsewhere. It is unavoidable that this case will be seen as having political significance. At the same time, the British Ambassador clearly stated to Matsuoka that British nationals have never engaged in any political activities. The only accusation that can be made against them is that they have worked to improve British-Japanese relations. The British Ambassador further mentioned the fact that there is a powerful and efficient Nazi Party organization within Japan and that all its members are trained in propaganda and political activities. The "News Chronicle" has recently published a commentary on the arrest of British nationals in Japan. After the arrest of several British nationals yesterday, it was also reported that Reuters correspondent in Tokyo, Cox, committed suicide by jumping from the Tokyo military police headquarters. No one in Britain can believe that Cox was either pushed out of the window or was being "severely interrogated" to the point of unbearable suffering. The British government must insist on a full investigation and adequate compensation for this unexpected incident. The newspaper also stated that Britain should clearly tell Japan that if anti-British activities continue unabated, Britain's policy will be reviewed, and the Burma Road can be reopened at any time. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Considers Response Measures</h3>
<p>London: Due to the press's demand that the British government reopen the Burma Road and arrest Japanese nationals in London in retaliation for the Japanese authorities' arrest of British nationals, the British cabinet held a meeting today to consider Ambassador Craigie's report on the Japanese actions. According to reliable sources, the British cabinet is currently considering whether retaliatory action is beneficial and possible. It is also reported that the British House of Commons is expected to receive a government statement after the start of today's afternoon session. Therefore, this issue will inevitably be raised in the House of Commons. The cabinet has quickly discussed whether or not to take retaliatory action. Craigie's report arrived this morning, and it is believed that the British Ambassador will report in detail on the Japanese arrest of British nationals, the death of Reuters reporter Cox, and his protests to Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka.

<h3>If One is Determined to Find Fault, One Can Always Find a Pretext</h3>
<p>New York: Reuters General Manager Zhang Xuelou, currently in New York, told an Associated Press reporter that the American newspaper report that the late Cox was a special agent of the British government is purely fantasy. He never paid any attention to espionage news. Cox was always a purely news agency employee and never published news that the Japanese could oppose. Cox loved Japan very much and had no relationship with the British government. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London: Sir Lock, Chairman of the Federation of British Industries, commented to the press on the mass arrest of British nationals in Japan, saying, "As far as the Federation of British Industries is concerned, it is absurd to suspect that the representatives of this association are involved in espionage." Among the twelve British nationals arrested, James, the association's representative in Japan, is one of them. Lock said that he has not yet received official news of James's arrest. According to the Asiatic Petroleum Company here, they have not received news of the arrest of Mr. Whalen, the company's deputy manager. It is reported that Whalen is the eleventh British national arrested in Japan. (Associated Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Holds Secret Meeting to Discuss Diplomatic Debate Methods</h3>

The Prime Minister said that whether the diplomatic debate should be held in secret or in public, he would let the House of Commons decide for itself. The House then immediately held a secret meeting to decide on this issue, and all observers left the meeting. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<h3>The Power of the British Navy Should Not Be Underestimated: Commentary from Pravda</h3>
<p>London: The Soviet Pravda reported that the British navy has suffered very little loss, only about 3.5% of its total tonnage, which is insignificant. The successful retreat from Dunkirk shows that the British fleet is capable of rescuing a large army and demonstrates that an invasion of Britain will be very difficult. It is almost impossible to conquer British overseas territories. The power of the German fleet is, of course, far inferior to that of the British fleet. British maritime history has taught people the two most important points of the navy, which are organization and discipline. We intend to make every effort to achieve these two points and equip the Red Navy with the best organization, discipline, and the best possible technical structure. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>Vichy: "Le Temps" recently published an editorial commenting on the situation of the war between Britain and Germany, stating, "There are various signs that the long-rumored war against Britain is about to begin. German radio stations have issued messages saying that the offensive against Britain is only a matter of time. The German side believes that the war against Britain will be the final act of the current European war. Whether this view is correct remains to be proven by facts. However, at present, there is absolutely no possibility for Britain and Germany to reach a compromise, and no matter which party comes forward to mediate, it will definitely not succeed under the current circumstances. This is beyond doubt." (Havas, 30th)</p>
<h3>Disturbances Occur in Northern Ireland: Republican Soldiers Cause Trouble</h3>

<h3>New Achievements of the Pan-American Conference: A Major Victory for American Policy; The Conference Will Open After the Security Treaty is Signed; A Seven-Nation Committee is Organized to Handle Foreign Territories</h3>
<p>Havana: Today, the 21 American republics will formally sign the resolution of the "Monroe Doctrine" to completely isolate the Western Hemisphere from powerful forces and prevent their aggression. The representatives have unanimously passed various plans to enhance the permanent security and harmony of the New World. These plans include (1) a plan to prevent European territories in the Western Hemisphere from falling into the hands of other countries; (2) an economic agreement to make the Western Hemisphere self-sufficient; (3) a plan to prevent non-Americans, Communists, Nazis, and Fascists from operating in the Americas. In general, the results of the conference are considered a victory for the United States. The conference is scheduled to officially close at 6:30 PM tonight. Half an hour later, US Secretary of State Hull and other US representatives will leave here for Miami and then proceed to Washington. Last night, American representatives, in a tense closed-door plenary session, turned the history of the New World in a new direction. They unanimously approved the main plans. The greatest achievement of the conference was the realization of the American determination to prohibit European territories in the Western Hemisphere from being transferred into the hands of non-Americans, which was adopted by the representatives. In practical terms, this conference means that the American republics will henceforth cooperate with each other on American political issues in an unprecedented way. (Associated Press, 30th)</p>
<p>Havana: At yesterday's plenary session of the Pan-American Conference, the "Havana Agreement," which stipulates that when the integrity of American countries is threatened due to the transfer of colonies, they can act independently or collectively, was passed. The agreement stipulates that if urgent action is needed and cannot be delayed, the American republics can take the actions they deem appropriate, individually or collectively, to defend their territories or the entire continent. It is generally believed that this provision indicates that the Latin American countries agree to the United States undertaking the defense of the entire continent and limiting the scope of the war to Europe. The agreement also stipulates the establishment of a temporary committee composed of seven members, which will be responsible for administering the administrative affairs of the colonies when the colonies are threatened before the establishment of the Alliance of the Conference. After the establishment of the Alliance, this administrative power will be transferred to the Territorial Management Committee of the American countries, which will be organized by 21 countries. This temporary committee will be composed of representatives from Brazil and other seven countries. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Capital of Cuba: The Pan-American Conference here announced the organization of a temporary committee to take united action when there is a change in the ownership of foreign territories in the Western Hemisphere. This committee is composed of representatives from seven countries, including Brazil, Venezuela, Ecuador, Panama, the United States, the Dominican Republic, and Paraguay, and will continue to serve until the convention of the permanent organization is approved by two-thirds of the American countries. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Havana</p>
<p>The Second Secret Plenary Session of the American Foreign Ministers unanimously approved the Pan-American Joint Custody System, so as to take care of the colonies of the defeated European countries in the Western Hemisphere under the principles of the Monroe Doctrine. The conference also passed the "Havana Act," so that the proposals passed by the conference can be implemented temporarily. At the same time, the conference also passed a principle stating that the proposals passed by the conference do not apply to territorial disputes between American and non-American countries. The conference also passed a proposal from the Argentine Committee. After a vote, it was decided that the next conference will be held in Rio de Janeiro. Argentina submitted a reservation, stating that "the Malvinas and other Australian Argentine" are not colonies of European countries, so the Havana Declaration does not apply to these lands. Observers believe that Argentina's reservation is quite important, because the reservation not only declares that the Falklands are Argentine territory, but also opens the door for its claims to the South Antarctic Islands. Argentina's reservation will be regarded by the world as Argentina's intention to covet the South Antarctic Islands. Argentina recently sent observers to the South Antarctic with American explorers.

<h3>American Newspaper Advocates Building Military Bases in South America</h3>
<p>Washington: "The Washington Post" wrote yesterday that the United States is very pleased that the representatives of the Pan-American Conference in Havana have reached an understanding on major issues. However, for military necessity, the United States should build bases in South America. Without a positive military commitment, any plan to defend the Western Hemisphere against possible invasion will be difficult to complete. Because the United States is the strongest of the 21 republics, the United States should bear the responsibility for defending most of the Western Hemisphere. This is known to everyone. If the United States cannot build naval and air bases in key locations in South America, it will ultimately be difficult for the United States to fulfill this responsibility.

<h3>Spain and Portugal Sign Mutual Assistance Treaty</h3>
<p>Madrid: Official documents here stated that the Spanish Minister to Portugal and the Portuguese Foreign Minister signed a mutual assistance treaty in Lisbon today. When the independence or sovereignty of one of the contracting states is threatened, the other party will come forward to assist. This treaty will take effect immediately after signing. The conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the two countries has further promoted the relationship between the two countries. (Haitong, 30th)</p>
<h3>Turkish Press Discusses German-Turkish Relations</h3>
<p>Istanbul: Yesterday, Turkish newspapers prominently published articles on the relationship between Germany and Turkey and the Balkans, stating that after the establishment of the German-Turkish commercial agreement, it is hoped that the relationship between the two countries can also be improved at the same time. The Tasviri Efkar newspaper stated that the signing of the German-Turkish commercial agreement is the best evidence that Germany wants to maintain a legitimate and permanent relationship with the Near East. (Haitong, 30th)</p>
<h3>Latvia Reforms Land Policy</h3>
<p>Riga: The Latvian Cabinet passed a new law on land policy reform yesterday after a resolution by the National Assembly. The law stipulates the establishment of a national agricultural fund, composed of state-owned land, church land, and land owned by wealthy farmers with more than 30 acres of land. Farmers with more than 30 acres of land must transfer the excess land to the government, adding it to the land fund. Landowners can cultivate the excess land indefinitely, but may not charge fees. (Haitong, 30th)</p>
<p>Riga: The Latvian Cabinet issued an order yesterday to dismiss the Latvian Ministers to London and Washington, Mr. Salins and Dr. Pirmanis, respectively. The government will also prosecute them for violating service discipline. (Haitong, 30th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Mass on Romanian Border</h3>
<p>Bucharest: The Soviet side is currently maintaining a firm attitude and is engaged in the severe discipline and fairness required there in Bessarabia. Moscow demands that Romania must treat the returning Bessarabians well, otherwise the Soviet Union will retaliate with border plans. According to travelers from Bukovina, the Soviet Union has thickly concentrated mechanized units along the new border of the Prut River to back up its demands to Romania. It is said that the Soviet Union has massed a large number of troops on the Romanian border, and therefore questions have arisen from several quarters, namely: if Germany devotes all its efforts to Britain, will the Soviet Union take the opportunity to send troops across the Hungarian southern plain to South Slavs where the tide of Great Slavic nationalism is relatively high? Now Germany and the Soviet Union are staring at each other in Bulgaria. It is not certain that the Bulgarian rulers will bring back a proposal to solve the Dobruja problem after meeting Hitler in Salzburg, but they will only receive advice to directly solve this matter with Romania in the near future. If so, the government will not be surprised, but those who hope that this trip will achieve greater results cannot help but be disappointed. The Salzburg meeting seems to have had no immediate effect on the demand for border revisions, and the Romanian rulers seem to have accepted Hitler's instruction for Romania and Hungary to negotiate directly. Berlin correspondents claim that the interests of the Axis powers in Southeast Europe are still purely economic. For this reason, peace must be maintained. As for Outer Transylvania, there is no doubt that Germany wants to cede several border provinces to Hungary and allow 2.5 million residents to become autonomous under German "protection." According to the German-language Riga Daily, the Nazi attitude has not been deceived by those who suddenly became friendly with Germany. Germany is willing for countries to conduct direct bilateral negotiations to resolve disputes in Southeast Europe, but Outer Transylvania has a deep relationship with German culture. Hitler has not allowed Germans from minor races to immigrate to Outer Transylvania in his immigration plan, which is enough to show that he has prepared a plan to place them under his own protection. The development of the Salzburg talks seems to have eased Romania's concerns, as the demand for border revisions seems to have been temporarily shelved. It is generally believed that the current Romanian government seems to be staying in office, and only the three members of the Iron Guard cabinet who recently resigned will be replaced by new members.

<h3>Slovak Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Capital of Slovakia: Slovak President Dr. Tiso appointed Prime Minister Duga to concurrently serve as Foreign Minister, and appointed Interior Minister Kuna to concurrently serve as Commander of the Hlinka Guard. Former Foreign Minister and Interior Minister Dukansky has resigned at his own request. (Haitong, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German leader Hitler, upon the recommendation of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, appointed Foreign Ministry Envoy Klingel to be the new German Minister to Slovakia. The current Minister, Bernard, has been ordered to return to external service. According to records, Klingel is an old member of the National Socialist Party. During the First World War, he served as the captain of a torpedo boat. Afterwards, he served as the Prime Minister of Saxony Province and the Consul of San Francisco. (Haitong, 30th)</p>

<h3>Plans to Conduct Field Research on Chinese Customs and Manners</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The "Asahi Shimbun" recently reported that the semi-official East Asia Problem Research Association plans to dispatch a research team to China to thoroughly understand the Chinese people, investigate customs and manners, and the current economic situation. The research will be led by the Vice President of the association, Okura. "Chinese people have always regarded traditional customs as sacred and inviolable. If they are not taken into consideration, any plans established for them will fail. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly understand them." The results of the team's research are expected to be published by the end of March 1942, at which time it will not be difficult to become "a good foundation for building a new Asia."

<h3>空 Battle of Dover: German Planes Shot Down - Twenty Planes Lost. English Bombers Raid Seventeen Locations in Europe Overnight. English Armed Fishing Boat Sunk by Mine.</h3>
<p>London - The Air Ministry announced that on Sunday night, English bombers raided military targets in northern and western Germany, the German-Dutch-Belgian borders, and northern France. The bombed targets included seventeen locations with oil depots, docks, cargo, and airfields. Three English planes are missing. Coastal Command English planes attacked the Cherbourg oil tanks in French territory, causing multiple fires. The English planes have returned safely. Furthermore, one English bomber attacked the Ruwardon airfield in Dutch territory, damaging several enemy planes on the ground. When the bomber was returning, it was intercepted by four enemy fighters. After a brief air battle, one enemy plane was shot down and the bomber returned safely. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>London - The Air Ministry announced that yesterday afternoon, English fighters shot down an enemy bomber each over the English Channel coast and the Thames estuary. It has now been confirmed that in the Battle of Dover yesterday morning, in addition to the enemy bombers shot down by English fighters, two more were shot down by anti-aircraft fire. The total number of enemy planes shot down yesterday reached twenty. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>London - The Admiralty announced tonight that the English armed fishing boat "Stoneden" has sunk after hitting an enemy mine in a certain sea area. The families of the ship's officers and crew have been notified separately. (29th Havas)</p>
<p>London - According to news received here yesterday afternoon, as a result of the fierce air battle over England yesterday, as many as twenty-seven German planes were shot down. According to those who witnessed the air battle over the southeastern coast on that day, there were about one hundred and sixty-seven German planes fighting with English planes. The sound of gunfire and bombing was deafening and frightening. The German planes fell like leaves, piece by piece. The Air Ministry described the air battle on the southeastern coast, stating that there were thirty Heinkel planes, eighty-seven Stuka dive bombers, and fifty Messerschmitt escort fighters, which attacked the harbor from the sky. English Spitfires and Hurricanes then took off to meet the enemy. Within minutes, the sky was densely packed with planes. The pilots of the English fighters engaged closely with the German pilots, making it impossible for the German planes to drop bombs. This air raid on the southeastern coast was the first large-scale attack on England's land. In addition to the fifteen planes officially announced to have been shot down by English planes, eyewitnesses also said that English anti-aircraft guns shot down four German planes. According to observers, when the English fighters were engaging the German planes above the anti-aircraft guns, they waited outside the range of the anti-aircraft guns. When the German planes could not withstand the anti-aircraft fire and increased their speed to retreat to their defensive positions, the English fighters flew to intercept them. This German air raid was an attempt to bomb both naval targets simultaneously. According to one eyewitness, the German planes dropped bombs like hail, except that they were not transparent but black. Most of the bombs dropped were incendiary bombs. The attackers were discovered at sunrise from the sea's eastern horizon. However, before they flew close to their targets, English anti-aircraft fire was already spraying flashing bullets at these dive bombers. The German planes dived like bees and locusts, and regardless of the danger, charged directly at the anti-aircraft fire. The Stuka dive bombers charged over the area they wanted to bomb and dropped their bombs. According to eyewitnesses, each plane seemed to drop one large bomb and four small bombs. After this batch of planes arrived, the second batch of planes arrived. The English fighters and anti-aircraft guns' defensive work became more intense. The terrifying bombs caused the buildings in the entire area to collapse, shattered the windows of houses miles away, and caused the seawater to spray upwards due to the violent shock, forming white waves. The ships in the sea were also shaken by the waves. Because the anti-aircraft fire was very dense, the last batch of bombers stopped diving and flew out of the range of the anti-aircraft fire. The English fighters rushed to pursue the German planes and fought with them to the English Channel. Only the sound of machine guns was heard over the coast, merging into one. Yesterday, according to the English official announcement, since June 18, the total number of German planes shot down over and near England has reached three hundred and eighteen. (30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>German War Report</h3>
<p>Berlin - This afternoon, the German war report stated that German dive bombers attacked Dover Harbour, and four ships with a total tonnage of 32,000 tons were severely damaged. When the German planes bombed, several English planes responded. As a result of the fierce battle, fifteen English planes were shot down, and three German planes were lost. In addition, German planes engaged in aerial reconnaissance sank one 10,000-ton British cruiser and one 1,000-ton merchant ship. Another merchant ship was damaged. Last night, English planes attacked western and northern Germany. The targets hit were not military objectives. In the town of Dusseldorf, five houses were hit and caught fire. Fortunately, the air defense rescue team arrived quickly and extinguished the fire. Near Wolfenbüttel, four houses were hit, and two of them suffered the most damage. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)</p>

<h3>Concentration of German Troops on the French Coast</h3>
<p>Marseilles - The German Navy and Army have gathered on the northwest coast of France. It is widely believed that this German action is in preparation for an attack on England.

<h3>Explosion at Gibraltar Arsenal; Libyan Governor Inspects Border Defenses</h3>
<p>Madrid - A loud explosion occurred in Gibraltar yesterday morning. The doors and windows of houses near the border were shaken. Spanish observers learned that the fire brigade had issued an alarm and a large number of ambulances rushed to the scene. English sources stated that a gasoline depot had exploded, but reliable sources claimed that the loud noise was an explosion at an arsenal, which killed four English soldiers and injured many more.

<p>Milan - "Sera" reported yesterday that the Italian army recently bombed Gibraltar and destroyed part of the fortress. A bomb hit an anti-aircraft gun team, killing the team leader and four soldiers on the spot, and destroying three large armory buildings. The report continued that after the bombing, the remaining civilians in Gibraltar fled one after another, and only military personnel remained in Gibraltar. The British authorities are now very concerned about the battleships "Hood" and "Resolution" docked in the harbor. Although the situation in the harbor is extremely dangerous, the ships were injured in the battle of Balearic and cannot sail, so they have to remain in the harbor. The report continued that Italian planes bombed Aden and sank a merchant ship. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)</p>

<h3>Romania Prepares to Return Lost Territories to Hungary and Bulgaria; Establishes Liaison with Axis Powers; Bulgarian Prime Minister Returns Home</h3>
<p>Bucharest - United Press learned from official sources here last night that Romania is willing to prepare to cede part of its territory to Hungary and Bulgaria in accordance with the agreement reached in Salzburg last week with Führer Hitler. Official sources stated that Romania has expressed its willingness to make concessions, believing that transferring this land is the most effective way to prevent communism from spreading to the Balkans and to ensure peace in southeastern Europe. It is rumored that Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini do not oppose the Soviet Union's occupation of Bessarabia Province, northern Bukovina Province, and the Baltic States, but have now launched efforts to curb the Soviet Union's westward advance and requested all Danube countries to cooperate in building an impregnable barrier.

<p>Sofia - Bulgarian Prime Minister Professor Filov and Foreign Minister Popov returned here by German special plane at 6 pm last night. They told reporters that the results of the German-Bulgarian negotiations cannot be announced at present, but the trip to Germany was very satisfactory. After getting off the plane, the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister were received by King Boris and immediately held a special cabinet meeting. Bulgarian newspapers paid close attention to the peaceful tone of the Romanian press and were satisfied with the statement in the Romanian semi-official newspaper "Romania" that the territorial demands in southeastern Europe would be resolved peacefully for the sake of the future interests and friendly relations of all countries. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)</p>
<p>Sofia - After meeting with the King, the Bulgarian Foreign Minister announced to the press about the negotiations with Germany, stating that they were very satisfied with the discussions with the German Führer and Foreign Minister. The German press has stated that the negotiations were conducted in a spirit of friendship, frankness, and mutual understanding. The German Führer and other leaders expressed deep sympathy for Bulgaria's demands. They were deeply grateful for Hitler's realistic and just claims. The Foreign Minister concluded by saying that the Bulgarian people should be assured and look forward to future developments. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)</p>
<p>Bucharest - This morning, local newspapers published semi-official comments on the Salzburg talks, solemnly pointing out the Romanian government's determination to establish a liaison with the policies of the Axis powers. The article stated that the visit of Romanian politicians to Germany and Italy was the first direct contact with the German Führer, the Italian Prime Minister, and the foreign ministers of the two countries after Romania firmly expressed its willingness to establish a liaison with the Axis powers. The harmonious and friendly spirit during the talks clearly indicated Germany and Italy's understanding of our country and peace in southeastern Europe. Romania's future task is to abide by the points agreed upon in the Salzburg and Rome talks. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)</p>

<p>Germany Needs Peace in the Balkans</p>
<p>Bucharest - Highly experienced political observers in Southeastern Europe believe that any prediction of the direction of the so-called Balkan development before the next Soviet action is purely speculation. It is generally believed that the policy of mutual understanding between the Soviet Union and Germany has come to an end with the Soviet occupation of Bessarabia. From now on, Soviet policy will mainly be opportunistic, and its scope will largely depend on the extent of the German offensive against England. If the Soviet Union has controlled Bulgaria's freedom and does not take the opportunity to cede Dobruja and mediate with Romania to win Bulgaria's gratitude, it would seem strange. Germany is reportedly greatly angered by Britain's recent expression of sympathy for Bulgaria's demand for Southern Dobruja. Therefore, German propaganda agencies in Southeastern Europe are claiming that Britain has begun to incite border revisions in the Balkans to stir up unrest, while Germany needs peace in the Balkans. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>Hitler's Main Objective Is Pacification</p>
<p>London - The Times commented today on the Balkan talks held at Berchtesgaden, stating that the initial feeling was that Hitler's main objective was pacification, using the entire group of countries between Germany's eastern border and the Aegean and Black Seas. Nothing has been discovered in these talks, as far as is known, that would dispel this impression. Hitler not only wants to avoid war, but even does not want conflicts to occur on both fronts simultaneously, which is his principle. Hitler still seems to want to focus all his efforts on conquering the British Empire. Will Hitler first deal with the enemy countries in Western Europe and then take the time to extend his hegemony to Eastern Europe? Or will he first control the resources of Eastern and Southeastern Europe and then, when his power is consolidated, fight the British Empire to the death? He will choose one. Judging from the current signs, he seems to be taking the first path. No matter what his final decision is, Britain is now waiting quietly, and believes that Hitler's reckless conquest plan will ultimately fail. (30th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Romanian Government Decides to Detain English Tugs</h3>
<p>Sète - The Romanian government has decided to detain eighteen English-leased tugs at the mouth of the Danube. German propaganda suggests that the countries of Southeastern Europe will soon have to reject British newspaper reporters and stop receiving news from non-Axis countries. Several new reporters arriving in Europe are being actively supplied with news by the Germans. (30th Reuters)</p>
<p>London - Officials have announced that the British government has lodged a protest with the Romanian government, stating that the Romanian authorities' detention of British ships sailing on the Danube and interference in the affairs of the English Commercial Oil Company, and the expulsion of English technicians, are all arbitrary actions.

<h3>Suez Canal Traffic Increases Significantly; Improved Position of English Troops</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters correspondent in Suez reports that Suez Canal traffic, which had once stopped after Italy entered the war, is now gradually increasing. Suez is now the main port of Egypt and is extremely active. Although facilities have increased, many ships are still forced to sail to Port Said or Alexandria to unload goods. Anglo-French relations are still satisfactory in terms of this canal. French officials are now working closely with the English Navy and Egyptian authorities. The majority of the Canal Authority's directors are French, but under the guidance of the French chairman, Benois, the work of the Bureau continues as usual, and the tolls collected are now stored in Cairo. According to English naval circles stationed along the river, Egypt is no longer at risk of supply cuts, as the Navy has repelled enemy ships advancing towards Massawa and Asab. Due to the constant surveillance and superiority of the English Navy in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, the enemy does not dare to disturb the English convoys. The ability and resources of the British Empire to respond are clearly visible from this point. Although British navigation in the Mediterranean has decreased, there is no panic here, and no rationing system has been implemented, because Britain has been supplying Egypt with goods from the Eastern Hemisphere. It is expected that the aircraft and other war equipment needed by the Middle East will soon be transported from the Americas to Egypt via this eastern route. The position of the English troops in the Middle East is very different from the pessimistic situation of the Italian troops in Abyssinia. Now that the supply to Abyssinia has been cut off, the Italian troops have turned from offense to defense. Although English merchant ships pass through the narrow Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which is easily within the range of Italian coastal batteries, the Italian navy and coastal batteries have so far not attempted to disturb navigation. At the beginning of the war, Italy had several submarines in the Red Sea, at least one of which was sunk by the English Navy. The only way for Italy to attack British shipping is through mines. Italy is extremely anxious about securing raw materials due to the activity of the English Air Force, and a large number of mechanical supplies will soon be needed to deal with the rebellions of various tribes in Abyssinia.

<h3>Rumor: Germany Considers Ceding Poland to the Soviet Union; Intends to Extend Influence in the Balkans</h3>
<p>London - According to information received here yesterday from Polish sources, Germany is currently considering ceding Poland to the Soviet Union. This plan is currently being discussed in Berlin and Moscow. According to Polish sources, the German authorities want to gain dominance in the Balkans, and in return have proposed merging the provinces of Warsaw, Lublin, and Lodz into a Polish Soviet Republic, subordinate to the Soviet Union. However, Germany still wants to retain Southern Galicia to avoid the Soviet Union gaining a common border with Slovakia and to serve as a German corridor to Romania. According to observers here, the development of this situation will create another difficulty for Britain, which has formally sought to restore Poland's independence, but has not yet proposed the return to Poland of the Polish territories occupied by the Soviet Union last September.

<h3>Estonian Border Closure</h3>
<p>Tallinn - According to Estonian radio reports, all foreign nationals are not allowed to leave Estonian territory, except for representatives of the diplomatic corps.

Estonian citizens are also not allowed to leave the country, so this decree completely closes the borders of Estonia. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)</p>

The Finnish government has also agreed to hand over to the Soviet Union the factory equipment evacuated before the Soviet-Finnish peace. The Soviet government will provide appropriate compensation. In addition, issues related to the Soviet Union and Finland are still under discussion. (30th Hsinwen News Agency)</p>

<h3>40th Anniversary of the Italian King's Accession</h3>
<p>Rome - The 40th anniversary of the accession of Italian King Victor Emmanuel is being celebrated by newspapers across the country, with articles praising him. It is said that during the parliamentary system, the Italian King also promoted policies that reflected the wishes of the people, and devoted all his efforts to improving social laws and protecting the working class. When the Blackshirts of Italian Prime Minister marched into Rome, the Italian King rejected the advice of his cabinet members, refused to oppose fascism, and called it a patriotic youth movement. Since the Italian King's accession, the Italian army has won victories in previous battles, so it is believed that the current war will also be blessed by the Italian King and win victory.

<h3>China, England and America should maintain close cooperation in the Far East, England can cancel Myanmar Road agreement at any time, Peace issue must first get Chinese permission</h3>
<p>Since the British government allowed Japan's request to blockade the Burma Road, the Chinese side believes that the British diplomatic policy is weak and appeasing, only encouraging Japan's insatiable desire, and at the same time, it cannot reduce the threat to Britain in the Far East. The American government and the public also feel disappointed about this matter, and criticisms are constantly published in newspapers. The world is paying attention to this. Here, an English observer in this city recently issued a statement on the British recent approval of Japan's request to blockade the Burma Road. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>Myanmar Road can be opened at any time</p>
<p>(1) The blockade of the Burma Road for three months is purely a temporary agreement. The British side reserves the right to cancel this agreement at any time. The most important condition agreed upon by the British and Japanese sides is that within these three months, efforts will be made to achieve peace between China and Japan, that is, both parties will freely negotiate a fair and equal solution. There is no question of Britain urging China to accept any conditions that it feels are harmful. A "fair and equal solution" clearly implies that Chinese permission must be obtained.</p>
<p>Maintain British and American cooperation in the Far East</p>
<p>(2) The Chinese people should have the impression that maintaining cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East is most beneficial to China. It is not in China's interest to try to create discord between Britain and the United States. Therefore, understanding between Britain and the United States should be cultivated. If the American government, for very good reasons in the current situation, feels it is not appropriate to guarantee what kind of action it will take in any specified situation, and if Britain feels that it is prudent to compromise with Japan because it has not received an American guarantee, then Sino-British, Anglo-American, or Sino-American relations should not be alienated as a result. Any attempt to stir up ill will among China, Britain, and the United States is not helpful, and only makes the positions of the three parties less favorable.</p>
<p>Britain and the United States need close understanding</p>
<p>(3) Englishmen should especially avoid criticizing the United States for not providing Britain with support. Both the British and American governments retain the freedom to act on their own. If the actions of both parties have not been parallel so far, it is because their respective situations have stronger reasons. Close understanding is needed between Britain and the United States, and this should not be harmed by the decision of the Burma Road.</p>
<p>Criticizing England is of no help</p>
<p>(4) On the other hand, Americans are also asked not to criticize the approach taken by the English side. It is ineffective to criticize British policy immediately without emphasizing the main points. The so-called main point is that England must now do everything possible to avoid making its position in the Far East more complicated, because England is now fighting for survival in Europe and cannot expect to defend rights around the world with one hand.</p>
<p>Gold Hall advises China and England to form an alliance</p>
<p>According to news from foreign sources, Gold Hall, who once served as the British naval attaché in China, recently sent a circular to various sectors, reporting on the world situation. One section mentioned the Far East, saying, "We have received news that the Japanese are not indifferent bystanders to the great gamble that Hitler and Mussolini are taking against England. We attach more importance to the Chinese people's resistance to Japanese aggression. If the Japanese intend to seize Hong Kong, then we hope that China and the British Commonwealth will form an alliance. The Chinese people have always kept their promises, and there is no doubt that they will become a major power in the world in this century. There are many points in common between the philosophy of Confucius and the principles of democratic life. If China and England form an alliance, we can supply the Chinese government's army with military supplies, and recognize that aggression is aggression, whether it occurs in Europe or the Far East. These ideas should be welcomed by the Chinese people, who believe that China is not without the possibility of participating in this great war of ideas abroad with its manpower. "</p>
<h3>Masnan Road Post Office: Japanese Side Did Not Inspect Mail Yesterday; Implementation Unlikely Before Za Peilin Returns to Shanghai, But Five Japanese Visited Again Yesterday for Observation</h3>
<p>The Japanese side's attempt to inspect mail in the French Concession is increasingly evident. Yesterday, Japanese inspectors made arrangements and took some proactive actions at the Masnan Road post office, leading to rumors of an official inspection starting yesterday. However, the exact date of the official commencement of inspections remains unconfirmed. The events of yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>No Inspection</p>
<p>According to a statement released by the Postal Administration at 4:20 PM yesterday, the rumor that Japanese inspectors had already begun officially inspecting mail at the Masnan Road post office today (i.e., yesterday) is completely untrue. The Administration has also not received any verbal or written reports from the Masnan Road branch regarding the commencement of mail inspections. As for the suggestion to change the Masnan Road branch into a "non-delivery branch," the head office has not considered this.</p>
<p>Origin of Rumors</p>
<p>After Japanese personnel visited the Masnan Road post office to inspect various aspects of postal administration, preparations for mail inspection have indeed become more concrete. At 8:00 AM yesterday, five Japanese individuals went to the branch again. Besides inspecting the procedures from receiving to delivering mail, they also entered the mail room and briefly flipped through the mail awaiting delivery, which sparked the rumor that mail inspection had started yesterday morning. Reporters visited the branch authorities yesterday and were told that if the Japanese were to start inspecting mail, instructions would certainly arrive from the head office. As the person in charge was unaware of such an event, its authenticity should be evident. In short, it is unlikely that implementation will begin before Director Za Peilin arrives in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Building an Office</p>
<p>After discussions between the two sides, the future office for the Japanese inspectors has begun construction. The location is in the rear section of the existing office of the branch. Because the area is open, four walls must be added to create a separate room. Therefore, the postal staff who originally worked there have been relocated. Although the number of Japanese inspectors has not yet been determined, it is expected to be between five and seven. Most of them are graduates of the Dobun Shoin college and have a considerable foundation in Chinese, but are not familiar with English or French. This shows that the Japanese side's action is purely targeted at Chinese people and Chinese language letters.</p>
<h3>Although Zhejiang and Fujian are Under Navigation Ban, Inland Transportation is Flourishing; Smaller Vessels are Rerouting to Remote Areas; Although the Scope is Narrow, Traffic Continues</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that the Japanese naval authorities are making every effort to strictly enforce the ban on coastal shipping that has been in effect since July 16. Consequently, certain types of Shanghai native products have become scarce due to the disruption of coastal shipping. Any ships of any nationality that continue to operate after the Japanese ban are</p>
<p>Immediately Detained</p>
<p>It is reported that the Portuguese-flagged ship *Sinta*, which was recently detained with its crew off Wenzhou, has now been released, carrying cargo and returning to Shanghai without loss. The ban imposed by the Japanese Navy has at least temporarily stifled the coastal shipping industry, but has not completely stopped operations. It is definitely known that several smaller flat-bottomed boats have been rerouted to</p>
<p>The Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>to transport goods such as cotton from inland villages, opening up new routes. The freight cost for transporting each bale of cotton to Shanghai is as high as thirty-five yuan. Therefore, several smaller shipping companies are engaged in this business, which, although small in scale, is quite prosperous. It is reported that bristles are also being transported. According to people in the shipping industry, China's vast territory cannot completely halt inland navigation. Ports such as Ningbo and Wenzhou, which only allow access from one direction, can certainly be strictly banned, but in areas that have not been occupied, there are countless villages, which were not very important before, that can be used as small ports for the exchange of goods.</p>
<h3>Statistics on the Number of Refugees</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Public Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 25th of this month, there are currently thirteen inspected shelters, housing a total of 7,446 refugees.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr Leaves Shanghai for Summer Retreat; Took a Steamer North to Beidaihe the Previous Evening; Expected to Return to Shanghai in the Shortest Possible Time</h3>
<p>British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, after returning to Shanghai on the 15th of last month, originally planned to go to Beidaihe for a summer retreat as usual. However, at that time, the situation in the Far East was tense, and the work of the British Ambassador also suddenly became busy, so the Ambassador's plan to go north for a summer retreat was invisibly canceled. However, one noon yesterday, the British Ambassador suddenly left Shanghai for elsewhere. Few people at the Embassy knew at the time. Even well-informed sources only knew that the Ambassador had left Shanghai, but were not very clear about exactly where the Ambassador was going. According to inquiries made by reporters from various relevant parties, the British Ambassador did indeed leave Shanghai, and boarded a steamer at 8:00 PM the previous night (the 29th) to Weihaiwei, then to Beidaihe. However, the Ambassador's trip north this time will not last many days, and he will shorten the summer retreat period as much as possible, and will return to Shanghai soon. Four Western detectives dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Police of the Public Concession to protect the Ambassador's safety were also temporarily withdrawn yesterday.</p>
<h3>Strike at the Shanghai Power Company: Management Proposes Counter-Conditions; Mr. Yu Qiaqing Met with Mr. Garrod Yesterday; Mr. Garrod Has Rejected the Workers' Demands</h3>
<p>Regarding the strike at the British-owned Shanghai Power Company, the company's chairman, Mr. Garrod, confirmed that Mr. Yu Qiaqing visited him yesterday afternoon in the capacity of a mediator. However, he said that the details of the content of the talks could not be made public at this time. According to well-informed sources, including within the company, the rumor that the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council would act as a mediator has been denied. Mr. Yu met with workers' representatives last night and may meet with Mr. Garrod again this morning. However, judging from yesterday's meeting, in addition to firmly rejecting the five demands made by the labor side, the management side has instead proposed five conditions to the labor side. Therefore, the future of the strike is still difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>Company Conditions</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing conveyed the five preconditions proposed by the workers (already seen in yesterday's newspaper) to Mr. Garrod. Mr. Garrod expressed that it was difficult to accept them, and instead proposed five conditions to Mr. Yu, asking him to convey them to the labor side. The gist of the conditions is as follows: (1) The board of directors is not prepared to accept the strike demands, but they may return to work on the existing basis if they are willing, in accordance with the following conditions. (2) The company is not prepared to re-employ workers who are considered unstable. If a worker's position has already been filled by someone else, the original worker will no longer be employed. (3) Striking workers must agree not to strike again in the future. Reasonable requests must first be presented to the board of directors for consideration. (4) Employees must be prepared to accept any work assigned by the company. (5) Striking workers must sacrifice all wages for the period of their strike. The above conditions were conveyed to the labor side by Mr. Yu at 3:30 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Employee Meetings After receiving these conditions, the company's employees and workers will separately inform all employees and workers. Both the employees and workers will each convene meetings to carefully discuss response measures. The results of the separate discussions will be jointly discussed again last night to determine consistent steps. The discussion lasted until late at night. According to disclosed information, it is likely that the labor side will once again ask Mr. Yu Qiaqing to do his best to mediate. Around this morning, the labor side will send representatives to meet with Mr. Yu to express specific opinions.</p>
<p>Council Efforts</p>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* reports that there is a possibility of an early resolution to the strike at the British-owned Shanghai Power Company. A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council announced this morning (the 30th) that the Council's Industrial Section is making efforts to mediate this dispute, hoping to bring about a satisfactory end to the strike. It is believed that the Industrial Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council is mediating, so both sides will hold talks in the next few days. At present, the Shanghai Power Company employs about one hundred temporary workers, mostly White Russian and German Jewish refugees. Although they are working hard, the supply of electricity has been greatly reduced compared to normal times. It is said that the supply of electricity to the French Concession has been reduced to less than one-third.</p>
<h3>Zhenhai Port is Peaceful</h3>
<p>The Ningbo organizations in Shanghai have received a follow-up telegram after the recovery of Zhenhai as follows: (1) Zhu Kongyang and other comfort officers from Zhejiang Province arrived in Ningbo the day before yesterday, and went to a certain place yesterday to comfort. Today, they still need to hire civilian ships to go to Zhenhai to comfort the troops. (2) The day before yesterday, Zhenhai Port was peaceful all day. The movements of Japanese warships in the waters of Zhejiang are as follows: Two Japanese warships are currently anchored outside Zhenhai Port, four Japanese warships are anchored in the Longshan waters, and one Japanese warship is also anchored in the Wushishan waters, a total of seven ships. Also, at 7:30 AM the day before yesterday, one Japanese warship sailed from the Hengshan waters and anchored in the Huhutou waters of Fenghua without moving. (3) At 4:16 PM the day before yesterday, a Japanese aircraft was spotted in the airspace above Haimen. The Ningbo air defense watchtower issued an air raid warning. An emergency warning was issued at 4:20 PM. It flew over Ningbo, and then the whereabouts of the Japanese aircraft were unknown. The warning was lifted at 5:12 PM.</p>
<h3>Doctors Are Not Obstructed During Curfew; Emergency Consultations Can Be Requested by Telephone</h3>
<p>According to news from the Shanghai Municipal Council, as summer is approaching, diseases are rampant. If doctors are called to visit patients during curfew hours, they only need to show their own business card to the police officers along the way to pass without obstruction. No additional passes are required. It is also convenient for citizens with emergency illnesses to call for medical attention late at night by telephone. Hopefully, all sectors will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Assault Case Between US Soldiers and Japanese Residents Concludes; US Consul, Etc. Visit Miura to Apologize</h3>
<p>The English-language *North-China Daily News* reports that Japanese embassy spokesman Tsurumi Ken said that the assault case between US soldiers and Japanese residents at the Taiping Cafe on the night of July 15 was satisfactorily concluded yesterday (the 29th) afternoon. US Acting Consul General Porter and US 4th Marine Regiment Commander Colonel Baker visited Japanese Consul General Miura at 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon to express their apologies for this unfortunate incident. It is reported that Colonel Baker also assured Miura that steps had been taken to prevent further accidents. Porter handed a letter of the same nature to the Japanese Consul General. Miura expressed complete satisfaction with the resolution of the case and said that he would abandon the intention to seek compensation for Japanese injuries. Regarding the arrest of a British resident in Japan at the end of the week, the spokesperson said that he had no comment to make.</p>
<h3>Chinese Going to Vietnam Must Have Passports; Due to Tense Situation, Guarantee Method is Cancelled</h3>
<p>The Visa Section of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently received an official letter from the Consulate General in Hanoi, reporting changes to the handling of Chinese entering the country. The original text is recorded as follows: "We have received a letter from the Supreme Administrative Office in Tokyo (Vietnam) stating that due to the tense situation, the exceptional method of allowing Chinese citizens to enter the country without a passport, guaranteed by this Consul General or Luo Weiqi, representative of the overseas Chinese in Haiphong, should be cancelled. In the future, Chinese citizens coming to Vietnam must obtain a passport and a visa from the French consulate in China before they can enter the country, etc. In addition to forwarding it separately, we are attaching the original letter for your reference."</p>
<h3>US Warships Enter Port</h3>
<p>After the US Navy transport ships *Black Hawk* and *Chaumont* left Shanghai one after another, it was reported yesterday that they had safely arrived in Qinhuangdao and Qingdao, and planned to stay for a short time. The *Chaumont* will return to Shanghai again at the beginning of next week to carry US Marines back to the United States. The *Gold Star* entered the Wusongkou at 6:00 PM (Customs clock) yesterday and arrived at the Yangjingbang Bund around 8:00 PM, moored at the British Navy pontoon, staying in Shanghai for a short time.</p>
<h3>During the Shutdown of the British American Tobacco Factory, Another Disturbance Arises; The Factory Again Dismisses Nine Representatives; It is Determined to Resume Work on August 2nd</h3>
<p>The British American Tobacco factory at the intersection of Huade Road and Taopeng Road in Hongkou announced a three-week shutdown on the 10th of this month, abolishing all original rice subsidies and allowances for workers. In addition to paying wages during the shutdown period, workers were given a subsidy of one yuan per day, except for Sundays. Workers' original five dou of rice subsidy and 30% temporary allowance were cancelled. After calculation, their income suddenly decreased by as much as twenty yuan, which made it difficult to maintain their lives in this era of high rice prices. Therefore, at 8:00 AM on the 10th, more than 30 male and female representatives from various departments were selected to request factory manager Mr. Weisbrock to maintain the original treatment, but were unsuccessful. After finishing work on that day, all the workers stayed in the factory and refused to leave. The management side then telegraphed the police station to send police officers to the scene to suppress and disperse them. It is now known that the British American Tobacco factory has dismissed nine worker representatives. As for the workers' demands, they are still delayed and unresolved. The factory has also set the resumption of work on August 2nd. However, workers were surprised after the factory announced the dismissal of the nine representatives on the 19th. Because during the labor unrest in the factory on January 25th of this year due to workers requesting increased wages, the management's attitude was quite amiable, allowing representatives of various workers to discuss directly, and guaranteeing that workers would not be dismissed without cause, which ultimately led to a resolution. This time, the workers' motive for requesting that allowances be paid in accordance with the original subsidies during the shutdown period was legitimate. Unexpectedly, the management dismissed nine representatives. All the workers of the factory expressed their dissatisfaction and looked forward to the sympathy and assistance of people from all walks of life to eliminate this dispute.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Reaches Ryukyu</h3>
<p>The newly formed hurricane in the Pacific Ocean continues to advance rapidly after changing direction. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 AM yesterday, the hurricane has now reached 24 degrees north latitude and 129 degrees east longitude. According to the reported coordinates, it is near the Ryukyu Islands. The local climate has been affected within 60 nautical miles of the current center of the hurricane. At present, the hurricane is still moving in a northwesterly direction, so its development path deserves attention.</p>
<h3>After the Death of Qian Hongye, the Legal Community Unanimously Expresses Grief; Qian's Remains Will Be Placed in a Coffin Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Qian Hongye, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, has served in the legal profession for more than 20 years. He was deeply knowledgeable in law, handled cases with the utmost impartiality, did not show favoritism or fear the powerful, but always showed leniency outside the law and gave the benefit of the doubt when the circumstances of the defendant were pitiful. After the illness of President Guo Yunquan, Qian acted as President. After the outbreak of the war, Qian and the court, despite repeated threats and intimidation, the police authorities ordered detectives to</p>
<p>Protect Them</p>
<p>However, Qian did not care at all, politely declining the protection from the police, and telling his colleagues that he would be loyal to his duty as long as he was in office, and he would not fear any threats. Moreover, his parents had both passed away, and his children were self-reliant, so he had no worries. Even if he lost his life in the line of duty, as long as he was not ashamed of the country and society, he would die with honor. After the assassination of Yu Hua, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the Gaochang Branch Court, some people advised him to accept police protection, but he still laughed it off. His</p>
<p>Firm and Decisive</p>
<p>spirit was praised by everyone. Now, it is unfortunate that he has been victimized, and people from all walks of life lament. The loss of such a fair, honest, and wise judge is a major loss to the judiciary. When Qian was dying, he told his family that he was not in pain and that he would die with integrity. The colleagues of the First Special Court said that although Qian had been victimized, they would continue Qian's</p>
<p>Indomitable</p>
<p>spirit, work hard in their positions, and never be discouraged by this. Qian's body has now been transported to the Central Funeral Home on Route Ma Bai. It is scheduled to be placed in a coffin tomorrow. At that time, colleagues from the First Special Court and the High Branch Court, as well as people from all walks of life, will go to express their condolences and plan to organize a memorial service to comfort the loyal soul.</p>
<h3>Adjusting the Public Rice Shops</h3>
<p>The first batch of 29,000 bags of rice ordered by the Fourth Phase Broken Rice Public Sale Committee from Saigon arrived in port on the "Aibao" ship yesterday, so there should be no problem with the supply of rice for public sale. The public sale will last for ten days, and all the rice shops responsible for issuing rice or selling tickets should be changed to achieve universality. The committee has decided to convene a committee meeting within a few days to adjust them to achieve significant results.</p>

Broken walls and ruins are displayed on the screen, just like the desolate scene of Zhabei, which makes people feel infinitely sentimental. It is heard that this film will be widely invited to news reporters and people from all walks of life in Taipu in three batches on August 5, 7, and 9 to visit.</p>
<h3>Impersonating to Collect Fake National Goods Certificates; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Sued; Official Certificates Must Be Collected Through the Association; Hope to Report Those Who Deceive</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce issued an announcement regarding national goods certificates: "This Chamber has previously reported to the inspection agencies of Zhejiang Province and reported by the business community that some people were holding national goods certificates issued in the name of this Chamber, selling cotton textiles to Zhejiang Province, which resulted in detention. It was found that a Mr. Zhang in this city was specializing in this type of collection business, deceiving in the name of the chamber, so that legitimate businesses were mistakenly deceived by him. The chamber has entrusted lawyer Chen Tingrui to file a lawsuit in accordance with the law. According to recent reports,</p>
<p>Another Case Discovered</p>
<p>There are other people in the business of impersonating certificate collection on behalf of cotton cloth companies. In order to prevent the business community from being deceived again, this chamber has to announce the key points of handling certificates to the public again. It must be known that for factories and firms applying for national goods certificates, such as the cotton cloth industry, the machine dyeing and weaving industry, the knitting industry, etc., all industries that already have the organization of the industry association must first have the factory and firm fill out an application form and report it to the association for verification and collection. This chamber</p>
<p>Will Not Issue Certificates</p>
<p>If There is no association to verify and forward. Moreover, for the sale of cotton textiles, the original factory receipts of where the raw materials or their products were purchased must first be submitted to the association for verification and then registered with this chamber before the goods can be sold with the registration endorsed and certificates issued separately. The procedures are extremely strict, and everything must go through the association. How can any private person collect certificates on behalf of the factories and firms? In the future, if there are any people who claim that they can collect national goods certificates on behalf of this chamber and deceive factories and firms, it is hoped that they will be reported directly to the police station or this chamber. We will definitely prosecute the cases together. This announcement."</p>

As for goods monopolized by government agencies, those that have been approved by the monopolizing agency to be purchased and transported by merchants may also be allowed to be exported by foreign exchange settlement. All goods designated this time as subject to foreign exchange settlement and goods monopolized by government agencies are determined to be</p>

(Detailed list of the types of export goods subject to foreign exchange settlement omitted)</p>

<h3>Housing Eviction Dispute; Landlord Wins Appeal</h3>
<p>The case of Jiang Zhongjia, the owner of the Jiang Zhongji Construction Factory, and Zhu Juexian, regarding the confirmation of lease disputes, has complex content. Zhu Juexian is not a tenant living in the house. His younger brother, Zhu Juemin, is a foreman in Jiang Zhongji's factory and originally lived in Dongjiadu in the South City. After the war, Jiang Zhongjia seeing that he had no house to live in, provided him with the downstairs house at No. 64 Luban Road completely for his residence, without charging rent. In the 27th year, Jiang Zhongji contracted the construction of the Guangxi railway bridge project and sent Zhu Juemin to be in charge of it. However, the house was taken over and replaced by his mother-in-law, Shen Zhu, who privately paid rent of 15 yuan per month from January of the 28th year. Jiang Zhongjia filed a lawsuit with the court to demand the eviction of the house on the grounds that there was no lease relationship with Shen Zhu. The Second Special Court ruled that the lease relationship between the two parties should continue to be valid. Jiang Zhongjia was dissatisfied with the ruling and appealed. After a detailed examination by the Third Branch Court, the judgment was pronounced the day before yesterday, stating in the main text, "The original judgment is changed. The plaintiff's lawsuit and the request for provisional execution are rejected. The costs of litigation in the first and second instances are borne by the plaintiff."</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Industrial Bank Sues Meiguang Factory Case; End of Revoked Debate; The Summons Will Be Held Again After the Rescheduled Date</h3>
<p>The case of Zhejiang Industrial Bank suing Jiang Yanwu, the manager of Meiguang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Tang Yanxiu, the associate, for repayment of overdrafts and mortgage debts, and returning a remittance order for 70,000 yuan, and allowing provisional attachment, etc., was tried by Judge Mo Runhua of the First Special District Court several times, lasting three months.

<h3>Central Grand and New Hotels: Several Men and Women Arrested – Japanese Military Police Collaborate with the Constabulary in the Arrest – Rumored Cause is Forging “Passes”</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 PM, two Japanese military police officers, along with police officers from the Hongkou Constabulary, first went to the Central Constabulary to request additional Chinese and Western detectives. They then traveled by car to Room 202 on the second floor of the Grand New Hotel at 108 Hubei Road, where they arrested five young men and women (three men and two women). It was said that the two women were both dancers. The occupations of the other three men were unknown. It was later learned that the room had been rented by a guest three days prior. The guest was named Xu Guoliang, a local resident, and appeared to be quite young, dressed in a Western-style suit and leather shoes. After the five men and women were taken to the constabulary, they confessed that there were other accomplices hiding in Room 520 on the fifth floor of the Central Hotel on the same road, in a place nicknamed "Yanziwo" (Swallow's Nest). At 6:45 PM, the Japanese military police again collaborated with police officers and went to the "nest" to arrest two men. Around 10:45 PM, they returned to a certain room in the Central Hotel and arrested two young women. Until midnight, detectives remained on guard in the rooms of the Grand New Hotel and other locations. It is understood that the reason for the arrest of these men and women was due to the forgery of certain passes.</p>

<h3>French Concession: Night Duty for Western Pharmacies</h3>
<p>The order for night duty for Western pharmacies in the French Concession was designated yesterday by the French Municipal Council and has been published in Western newspapers. At the same time, each Western pharmacy on night duty was notified by letter. This procedure has been in place for many years, and since its implementation, it has indeed been convenient for the public.

<h3>Gonghua Shelter Transfers Ownership and Renames to Youyou Nurturing Home</h3>
<p>The Gonghua Shelter, run by the Shanghai Tzu Lien Relief Association, specializes in sheltering child refugees and providing them with appropriate education. Recently, due to financial difficulties, it has become difficult for the association to sustain the shelter. Therefore, the Executive Committee of the Chinese Staff Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council, on the 28th of this month, took over the existing students, registers, and equipment of the shelter according to the list and renamed it the Youyou Nurturing Home to continue its operation. The Tzu Lien Relief Association will provide supplies until the 31st of this month and then completely disengage from the shelter.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>According to our client, Chen Renhao, regarding the case of suspected forgery and fraud brought against him, although the first instance trial has concluded, he has filed an appeal, which is currently pending. However, in the "Local News" section of the Shen Bao on the 30th of this month, an article titled "Bank Employee Commits Fraud and Embezzlement; Appeal Rejected; Chen Renhao Still Held to Original Verdict" was published, claiming that the appeal case was concluded yesterday and the appeal was rejected. This is clearly a fabrication intended to mislead the public. We request that you correct this information to clarify the facts.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3>Report from the Sichuan Education Commissioner: Progress in Preparing National Education (1) – Five-Year Plan Completed Three Years Ahead of Schedule – Funding, Teachers, and Methods All Stipulated</h3>
<p>(Chengdu Airmail News) When the Sichuan Provincial National Education Committee held a meeting on July 11, Commissioner Guo Youshou reported during the meeting on the "Progress of Preparing National Education in Sichuan Province." He described the various plans in great detail. The report is recorded as follows: "Since Sichuan Province was ordered in September of the 18th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1929] to implement the new county system starting in March of this year, the implementation of national education has also been planned simultaneously. Now, the plans have been finalized and it has been decided to start implementation from August of this year. The progress of the preparations is reported separately as follows:</p>
<p>Formulation of Implementation Methods</p>
<p>Since receiving the order to implement the new county system, the Education Department immediately dispatched personnel in charge of national education and civil affairs personnel in charge of local autonomy to discuss implementation methods. After several exchanges of views, a draft plan for the implementation of national education was drawn up. In November of last year, this plan was taken to Chongqing to seek instructions from the Acting Chairman and the Ministry of Education. The Ministry stated that national education should be popularized nationwide in five years, but Sichuan Province, as the location of the wartime capital, has become the base for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. It is proposed to complete it in three years to establish the foundation for a new national education system. After approval from the Acting Chairman and the Ministry of Education, and in accordance with the guidelines of the Acting Chairman, the Sichuan Provincial Implementation Measures for Establishing Township Central Schools and Bao National Schools were drafted and submitted to the 359th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee for approval. Furthermore, it was believed that the smooth implementation of these measures depended on the joint efforts of the commissioners of each district and the magistrates of each county. Therefore, during the first and second Commissioners' Meetings, each commissioner was invited to contribute their opinions as much as possible for reference and revision. In March of this year, the Ministry of Education convened a national education meeting for each province and city, which included much discussion on the implementation of national education. At the same time, the Ministry of Education promulgated the National Education Implementation Guidelines and the Essential Points for Establishing Township Central Schools, which differed somewhat from the measures established in this province. Therefore, when this province convened a provincial normal education and education inspection meeting, the province's national education implementation measures were discussed in detail, regarding how to comply with the regulations of the central government. The Education Department, based on the resolutions of the central government and provincial meetings and the regulations of the National Education Implementation Guidelines, revised the previously established implementation measures and submitted them to the 380th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee for approval and implementation. The key points of the measures are: In the first year, each township will establish one central school, and at least one national school will be established for every three bao. In the second year, at least two national schools will be established for every three bao. In the third year, one national school will be established for each bao. At the same time, the Outline of the National Education Plan for Sichuan Province, the Distribution Table of Newly Added Classes in Each County and City in Sichuan Province for the Three-Year Implementation of National Education, and the Points to Note for the Planned Implementation of National Education in Each County and City in Sichuan Province were also drafted and promulgated separately. Currently, the laws and regulations related to national education have been compiled into the first volume of the Essentials of National Education Implementation Measures, and other relevant laws and regulations are still being compiled.</p>
<p>Approval of Funding</p>
<p>According to the regulations of the Outline of the National Education Plan for Sichuan Province, 20,000 primary school classes must be added each year for three years. The funding required for adding classes in the first year is 16 million yuan, 32 million yuan in the second year, and 48 million yuan in the third year. In the first year, 50% should be raised by each county locally, which should be 8 million yuan. 25% should be subsidized by the province and the central government respectively, which should be 4 million yuan. In the second year, 60% should be raised by each county locally, which should be 19.2 million yuan. 20% should be subsidized by the province and the central government respectively, which should be 6.4 million yuan. In the third year, 70% should be raised by each county locally, which should be 33 million yuan. 15% should be subsidized by the province and the central government respectively, which should be 7.2 million yuan. The funding for teacher training requires 5.4 million yuan each year, with half being raised by the central government and the province respectively, which is 2.7 million yuan. These figures have been submitted to the Ministry of Education and the provincial government for approval. The subsidy for national education in Sichuan Province for the second half of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940] has been approved at 2.2 million yuan (of which 200,000 yuan will be used to run provincial normal schools). After the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941], it should be re-approved when preparing the annual budget. The Ministry of Education has approved the central government's subsidy for the first year: 3.5 million yuan for increasing schools and classes, and 900,000 yuan for subsidizing teacher training. In the second year, 6.3 million yuan for increasing schools and classes, and 720,000 yuan for teacher training. In the third year, 7.28 million yuan for increasing schools and classes, and 720,000 yuan for teacher training. In the second half of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], the central government's subsidy for national education should be 2.2 million yuan, which, together with the provincial subsidy of 6.2 million yuan, totals 8.4 million yuan. The use and distribution of this subsidy are as follows: (1) 1.6 million yuan for training teachers, which, together with 200,000 yuan for running normal schools, totals 1.8 million yuan; (2) 2 million yuan for subsidizing the increase of classes in each county and city; (3) 300,000 yuan for printing teaching materials; (4) 50,000 yuan for guidance fees; (5) 50,000 yuan for assisting border areas; (6) 200,000 yuan for special subsidies for early completion of national education in each district. However, the method of distributing, managing, and auditing the use of this funding will be properly drafted by the National Education Committee. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Education Department Holds the Second Session</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) In order to assess the qualifications of secondary school teachers, the Guangdong Provincial Department of Education is now continuing to hold the second session of the secondary school teacher exemption assessment. It has also issued an order to registered secondary schools in Hong Kong that all teachers who have not participated in the first assessment must apply for assessment. When applying, the application form must be filled out clearly, and the diploma, teacher appointment letter, and any writings should be sent by registered mail to the Secondary School Teacher Exemption Assessment Committee of the Shaoguan Education Department. The application period is from the date of receipt of the department order to the end of August. In addition, more than 5,000 people applied for the first Guangdong Provincial Secondary School Teacher Exemption Assessment held in the 26th year of the Republic [i.e., 1937]. The review was completed in batches in the previous year, and certificates were issued and documents were returned. For those who have not received them due to the impact of the war, the Education Department has entrusted Guangzhou University in Hong Kong to handle this matter and has notified all those assessed to go and collect them. However, there are still hundreds of people who have not collected them. The university has issued another notice to collect them within one week; it will not be responsible for safekeeping them after the deadline.</p>

<h3>Upsets in the Hezhong Cup Basketball Tournament: Shanghai Qing Sadly Loses to Qunyi – "Big Cat" Absent, Forced to Finish with Four Players – Second Division Match: Muer Overcomes Zhongyi</h3>
<p>In the Hezhong Cup charity basketball tournament, Shanghai Qing played Qunyi again yesterday in the first division. Shanghai Qing's star player Sun Hupei ("Big Cat") was unable to play due to a foot injury, which greatly impacted their strength. Qunyi, on the other hand, learned from their crushing defeat in the previous game and sought to avenge themselves. After a major adjustment to their lineup, they were much stronger. Relying on the efforts of its players, Shanghai Qing took the lead at every turn, but Qunyi closely followed, creating an extremely tense situation. At halftime, Shanghai Qing was only one point ahead at 25 to 24. After switching sides, the competition remained fierce, but Shanghai Qing maintained its lead advantage. Unexpectedly, Wang Qiang and Wang Cai Gao of Shanghai Qing were sent off with four fouls each, and they had to play with only four players. Qunyi seized the opportunity and broke away three minutes before the end, finally winning by luck with a score of 55 to 50. This caused another upset in the tournament. In another match in the second division, Muer defeated Zhongyi with a score of 32 to 16. Muer also led at halftime with a score of 15 to 7.</p>

<h3>Finance: Buying Sentiment Prevails, Gold Market to Rise and Be Difficult to Fall – Recent High Price Reaches 5,500 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cash market, under-the-table trading, and buying sentiment all became stronger, and operators were all satisfied. This is because the exchange rate is tight, and rumors of a Japanese military landing on the coast and the scaling back of the listing by the Chongqing Central Bank are sufficient to affect people's minds with a firming underlying trend. Like fuel on the fire, the midday market was still flat, initially opening at 5,400 yuan, reaching a high of 5,408 yuan. Securities firms bought more, and money changers sold from time to time. The midday close was 5,400 yuan. After the afternoon opening, it immediately rose to 5,430 yuan. Later, it was heard that the exchange rate was tight and the above rumors arose, and the price rose to 5,500 yuan. It was heard that securities firms were busy buying and selling. Besides money changers Gao and You, there were very few sellers. Before the close, retail investors liquidated a considerable amount, so it rose by 97 yuan. Overall trading was still strong, about 3,000 liang [taels] or so. Jewelry stores raised the price of gold ornaments by 10 yuan in the end. Customs gold and other items remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Cash Rises 97 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each 1,000 liang [taels], initially, because people's minds were nervous, there were many buyers when it opened. The first gold dealers did 20 liang [taels] between each other, at 5,400 yuan, 17 yuan higher than the previous day. Then, because a money changer was vigorously acquiring, it continued to raise by 5 yuan. Silver houses did 30 liang [taels] between each other, at 5,405 yuan. But after this, a certain money changer suddenly dumped, and after the U.S. dollar note rose and fell back, buyers decreased. Silver houses sold 30 liang [taels] to jewelry businesses, lower at 5,385 yuan. Fortunately, money changers and silver houses and others came back to search and buy, and at that time, the U.S. dollar note recovered, so it all surged to 5,408 yuan. The buying wind dissipated at midday and once retreated to within the 5,400 yuan level, but the midday close was 5,400 yuan. After the close, because the exchange rate was slightly tight, the U.S. dollar note did well, and gold dealers and securities firms competed to buy, and finally, the midday close price rose by another 10 yuan, and it was still difficult to find sellers. People's minds were even firmer after the afternoon opening, and they all looked higher, shouting 30 yuan higher than the midday close. Silver houses sold 20 liang [taels] to jewelry businesses, at 5,430 yuan. Then, because the foreign exchange rate was tight, people's minds were especially shaken, and securities firms and retail investors and others vigorously bought. Soon, it skyrocketed another 50 yuan. Securities firms bought 80 liang [taels] from silver houses and others, at 5,480 yuan. After that, the buying wind subsided slightly, and money changers took the opportunity to release at a high price, once falling back a little 15 yuan. Silver houses sold 30 liang [taels] to securities firms, at 5,465 yuan. After entering the market again, the buying intention of securities firms sprouted again, and they came back to frantically search, and it soared another 35 yuan. Gold dealers sold 20 liang [taels] to silver houses, rising to 5,500 yuan, the recent highest price. At the close, money changers with long positions took profits and sold, and floating longs also sold, and it fell back a little 20 yuan. Gold dealers sold 20 liang [taels] to securities firms, at 5,480 yuan, as the late closing price. As a result, it rose 97 yuan compared to the previous day. The market situation was still firm after the close, at 5,495 yuan. There were a small number of sales open, with a fluctuation of 115 yuan for the whole day. The cash gold of the gold dealers' own brand was sold at a slightly higher price than the spot cash market by several yuan, and the buying price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there are few open sales.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Raised 10 Yuan in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Jewelry gold was still suspended at 550 yuan per liang [tael] when it was initially sold, but at around 2 p.m., it began to rise by 10 yuan. It is estimated that Datong Hang changed the suspension to 560 yuan, and the new peers were similar to the above price, reducing the purchase price by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Fluctuations: A Larger Range</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange rates showed a tightening trend. Besides numerous foreign firms settling accounts, there were also favorable rumors, such as Japanese troops landing on the coast and the Central Bank of Chongqing reducing its listed rates, causing sellers to hold back. Speculators actively increased their positions. However, the British gold rate remained steady in the morning session, while the American exchange rate reached $6.03125. By the afternoon, the aforementioned rumors spread, triggering significant buying, and the American exchange rate reached $6, threatening to break through. Fortunately, foreign and American banks had ample supply, and the market calmed down. In the end, the British gold rate was 3 pence 859375, and the American exchange rate was $6, with the British rate falling 0.015625 and the American rate tightening 0.03125 compared to the previous day's close. The futures trend mirrored the spot market.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Cable Brings Settlement Advances</p>
<p>Early morning saw London large bars up 1.875, distant contracts up 0.0625. New York silver prices remained stable, and London raw gold was fixed. The exchange rate between British and American currencies was unchanged, and also stable against Shanghai. The American currency was up half a point against the British currency, and slightly up two points against Shanghai. There was no market for the exchange rate against the French currency. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3 pence 875 for British gold and $6.0625 for the American exchange rate, both unchanged compared to the previous evening's close. There was a lack of buyers after the opening. Sterling was once quoted at 3 pence 890625. Subsequently, a cable from Hong Kong quoted this month's sterling, with the Netherlands and East Asia offering 3 pence 875. HSBC's listed rates were announced unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced to increase by 1.25%. After this, the market was stable. Speculators and American banks sold to firms like Arnhold this month's American exchange rate at $6.0625. However, after 10:30 AM, foreign firms suddenly entered the market to settle accounts, and this month's American exchange rate price slightly softened. At that time, the buying price for foreign firms' American exchange rate was from $6.0625 to 0.03125, and next month's American exchange rate price was $6. However, the situation was still stable until the noon close. In the end, the British gold rate was 3 pence 875, and the American exchange rate was $6.03125, with the British rate being stable and the American rate slightly tighter by 0.03125 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>American Exchange Rate Closes at $6</p>
<p>The afternoon gradually saw a tightening trend, due to rumors of Japanese troops landing on the coast and the Central Bank of Chongqing reducing its listed rates. Consequently, foreign firms were aggressively settling accounts, and speculators were also buying in. Initially, the American bank sold this month's American exchange rate to firms like Arnhold at $6.03125. Later, foreign firms entered the American bank and quoted $6. For August, Chinese speculators and foreign firms bought in Sassoon on the mainland at $5.96875. Until the evening close, there was little change. In the end, the British gold rate was 3 pence 859375, and the American exchange rate was $6. The British gold rate for September was 3 pence 84375, and the American exchange rate was $5.96875. Compared to the previous day's evening close, both the British gold rate in the spot and futures markets contracted by 0.015625, the American exchange rate in the spot market tightened by 0.0625, and the futures market contracted by 0.03125.</p>
<p>Hong Kong American Dollar Alone Tightens</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 30th (Tuesday) Cable: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The spot rates for both British and Shanghai currencies opened at the original levels. The spot rate for the American currency tightened by 0.0625, to $23.375 (the previous close was $23.375). The spot rate for the Japanese currency contracted by half a yuan, to $98.5. At 9:45 AM, the spot rate for the Shanghai currency rose by one yuan, to $384. It was flat at 11:30 AM. There were no gains or losses among the various currencies. The market opened flat at 2:30 PM and remained calm without changes.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Also Contracts</p>
<p>Tianjin, 30th (Tuesday) Cable: The exchange market opened flat this morning. The spot rate for the British currency tightened by 0.03125, to 3 pence 59375. The spot rate for the American currency contracted by 0.0625, to $5.625. The Shanghai currency decreased by half a yuan, to $107. The unofficial "Joint Note" rate was cheapened by four cents, to $94.15.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Surge Intensifies</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw an intensified surge. The British and American gold pounds also rose rapidly, resulting in an increase of $2.50 each. The demand for British gold notes was strong, and the price rose by 30 cents. With the black market American exchange rate already contracted to the $6 level, there were even more favorable rumors in the afternoon, leading to strong buying. The evening market was as high as $16.75, continuing to rise by 30 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose by one cent following the Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rate. The demand for Japanese and Korean gold notes was increasingly strong, and the market prices uniformly rose. The former was as high as $1.25, and the latter was $1.085.</p>
<h3>July Interbank Transfer Deposit Interest: $6 Per Thousand</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Joint Reserve Committee has set the interbank transfer deposit interest for July at $6 per thousand (equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 6%), a decrease of $1.50 compared to the previous month.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities grey market saw the last day for the ninth-term interest, but the market surprisingly rebounded slightly. Market sentiment suddenly turned weak. Rumors of a Japanese attack on Vietnam and a large rise in gold prices made people feel even more disheartened. Starting today, interest calculations are excluded. The actual interest received is $2.85, but it needs to be collected in six installments, so the actual amount is about $2.70. Therefore, the market price should be connected to this type of calculation after excluding interest. Because the future loses the support of interest, it may ease slightly. Yesterday's trading showed unsustainability in the morning. The bulls frequently sold out. The bearish sentiment was even stronger in the afternoon. Type B broke through $4, and Type C also broke into the $2 level. Market sentiment suddenly weakened. Various households entered and exited, with Changchun Tongkang and No. 38 consistently buying in. Others, such as Gong Mao, Defu, Renchang, and Xinfu, also had needs, but the selling sentiment was stronger. For example, Yihong, Hongda, Yichang, Shengda, Da, and No. 64 were continuously released, or spot goods flowed out, so the bulls were never able to raise their heads. Among them, Type D had little trading, and the market price was still able to stand firm. The others uniformly fell by 20 to 35 cents. The total transaction volume was estimated at more than $1.1 million. A simple table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A	63.20	62.95	63.05	Down 0.20</p>
<p>Unified B	54.00	53.90	53.90	Down 0.20</p>

<p>There were no-ticket transactions, with 100 shares of Chengxiao New Company stock traded at a price of $9.50. Yesterday's stock market in the Public Industry Association fluctuated uncertainly, mostly swayed by various news. The opening market was sluggish and soft. Later, it rebounded slightly. Finally, due to the news that the Dutch Indian government would impose an additional 5% tax rate on exports of rubber, tin, and oil in addition to the current tariffs, prices immediately softened again. The tightening foreign exchange in the afternoon clearly helped the stock market. The market closed with excellent morale.</p>
<p>London, 29th (Monday) Cable: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British South public stocks saw a slight weakness in Chinese foreign bonds, with English and French loans and British and French bond notes falling by £5, priced at £35.

<h3>Grains: Another 50,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrive, Market Prices Suppressed and Difficult to Rise, Only Japonica Rice Rises by About Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The current foreign rice market, after turning firm once before yesterday afternoon, still saw sellers holding up the market in the early morning. For example, No. 1 Chen Saigon was priced at $53-54, and Fire-hulled at $51-52. However, sales were not good. Guests saw that the source was continuous and the inventory was sufficient. There was no possibility of a high rise. The market was neither soft nor firm. The market was not soft, but peoples' hearts were discouraged. Although the shouts gradually fell, it was difficult to arouse buying interest. As a result, it was known for being flat and tired. The closing price of No. 1 Chen Saigon was still $51-52. Road goods once rebounded by half a yuan in the early market, but immediately went down all the way. The reason was that the inventory was too large and peoples' hearts were weak. As soon as it rose, it fell, and it was difficult to last. The rice of the Road goods that has already arrived is to be handed over immediately. The No. 2 rice opened early at $58.5, which seemed to be able to stand firm at the same time as the current rice. Unexpectedly, new stocks disappeared and were waiting and watching, while the thin-capitalized firms and floating scattered customers were unwilling to stick to it again, and immediately depreciated to seek relief. The price immediately fell from $58, $57.5-6, $57, to as low as $56.5, which was $1.5 less than the previous closing price. Saigon No. 2's July shipments opened early at $57, and then fell from $56.5 to as low as $55.5, which was $3.5 less than the previous opening price of $59. The June shipment of small-hulled rice opened at $58.5 and $58, but later the importing households did not continue to open, and the transaction volume was more than 400 tons. 5,000 bags of current rice, 2,000 bags of early-season Jiangbei Indica rice newly arrived, because the price of foreign rice was small, only opened at $47.5 to $47.</p>
<p>A large amount of foreign rice is coming one after another. Yesterday, the Taikoo Company's Jinan ship arrived in Shanghai, carrying 12,006 bags from Hong Kong. The Ninghai ship also arrived at the port at the same time, also carrying 13,931 bags from Hong Kong. The ships were all docked at the company's wharf in Pudong for unloading. In addition, the Norwegian ship Herlaik, managed by the Gaodeng Foreign Company, directly carried more than 25,000 bags from Saigon. It arrived at the port at 5 PM yesterday and docked at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<p>Although there is not much glutinous rice, it is still difficult to gain a foothold due to the competition of foreign glutinous rice. The price has depreciated by one yuan. It is heard that the Jin brand is $56-57, the Changdan white brand is $54-55, the Hong Kong white brand is $55, and the next is $53.</p>
<p>The price of thick and thin Japonica rice rises separately. When the incoming goods arrive intermittently, it is rumored that the off-market grey market is firm and rising when the price of foreign rice is tight, or the transaction is quite large, and the selling price is uniquely doubled by about two yuan. Chang Fresh Qing Japonica is $65.5, $65, Wuxi Qing Japonica is $64, Changzhou Japonica is $62-63, and the next is $60, and Su is about $58. Qingsi Thin Rice is $64-65, to $62-63, and Nangang Fresh Gao Hu Early Rice is $58.5, $58, etc.</p>
<h3>Southeast Asian Flour Sales Move Slightly</h3>
<p>Flour</p>
<p>Trading was slightly more active yesterday. Since the No. 2 flour mill changed to $15, some of the people who use miscellaneous brand flour have changed to factory flour. Therefore, the number of batches of the two factories has continued to increase to about 6,000 bags. Moreover, the Southeast Asian gang also felt that the factory price was cheaper, and the appetite moved slightly. It is estimated that 2,000 to 3,000 bags of Kaitian Bamboo brand, etc. were sold at a price of $16. The supply and demand of other Japanese factory flour and mainland flour were both silent. The price of Phoenix brand was only $13.5, and there was still no formal transaction.</p>
<p>Wheat</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market was still in a stalemate. Although the stock in Hongkou and Zhabei has been abundant recently, the selling price has been suppressed a lot by the Japanese factories. The goods owners are mostly unwilling to depreciate again due to the difficult transportation procedures. Therefore, apart from the Chinese factories slightly taking in 1,000 to 2,000 bags throughout the day, the rest were lacking in sales. The price was $20.065.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Cotton Yarn Production and Consumption Cannot Balance, Double Horse Falls Back More Than Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had risen for two consecutive days, fell back again yesterday. The reason is that actual sales have not seen large-scale development, so a new buying trend has not started. Moreover, the large households who had taken in goods for several consecutive days also stopped buying because their prices had risen. At this stage, the table was slightly stagnant and turned into a downward trend. Some profit-makers were active in selling out, and as a result, the market fell again. The root problem is that inventories are increasing day by day, and production and consumption cannot balance.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the current yarn market showed a lively and enthusiastic appearance of the bulls. The shouts were loud. In fact, the prices can only be raised after the price is raised. There is a lack of .... The household that .... under the circumstances of .... has not much desire for .... Seeing the threshold of 1,000 yuan, .... force out, .... compete to .... because .... against .... downwind, the opening price is 985 yuan. After shouting for a long time, no new prices were seen, and it fell back to 975 yuan. However, after the closing, .... to 968 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, there were 1,815 bales, and the price of 20-count Double Horse fell by more than ten yuan. Today, 70 pieces of yarn were transported to Haikou, 950 pieces were transported to Hong Kong, and 140 pieces were transported to Xiamen. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same Trade	1,250	Hong Kong	535</p>
<p>Xiamen	10	Mainland	20</p>
<p>Total	1,825</p>
<h3>Japanese Factories Reduce Work, Cotton Market Weakens Further</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation has entered a sluggish path again. The factories are still taking in large quantities of goods, but in fact, the yarn market cannot rise actively, and there is little intention to compensate for raw materials. As for the Japanese factories, they occasionally add to their purchases, but the payment period is still delayed by one month. And the overseas sources are constantly connected, so the cotton market has little hope of major growth in the short term.</p>
<p>Another message, the price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, initially due to the high prices of spot goods, the latter due to Southern gang, the result of the price was down three, India market yesterday, together with forecast fell three rupees more.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading has been very quiet these days. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude because of the end of the month. Japanese factories have a low inventory and sluggish yarn sales. It is said that there are reductions in working hours. Transactions between colleagues are very rare.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: New and Old Soybeans Do Not Connect, Market Is Exceptionally Advantageous</h3>
<p>The soybean market is very firm and smooth because the old goods have dried up, the new goods have not yet entered the market, and the sales are still available. The goods that are stored in general, which used to be considered as inferior goods, are now regarded as high-status, and are still regarded as rare goods. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags of Anqing beans were purchased from Shantou, Xiamen, Guangzhou and other streets, priced at $28.5 to $29.7. More than 300 bags of Bengbu beans were purchased, priced at $26.58. 50 bags of Pudong Society beans were purchased, priced at $29.7. 60 bags of Chongming Sand Yellow were purchased, priced at $26. Also today, 3,700 bags of soybeans were transported to Xiamen, and 950 bags were transported to Hong Kong. 270 bags of raw peanuts were transported to Hong Kong together, and 150 bags of raw oil, and 300 bags of high, were all transported to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Balls Rise Again and Again, Adding Another $8 Per Ton</h3>
<p>The coal ball market has risen again by $8 yesterday since the association started to regulate prices some time ago. It is estimated that the coal balls of Yitaixing, Nanyang, etc., are sold by the same industry at $120 per 100 tons if picked up by themselves, and $126 if delivered. Retail sales in the streets are $6.80 per load, which is another 40 cents higher than yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Sugar Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association set the market prices: Second and Fourth Grade coarse white sugar was priced at 67 yuan for local warehouse stock, and 65.7 to 66 yuan for foreign warehouse stock. In the afternoon, due to news of rising coarse sand prices in the Netherlands (11.125 yuan), market sentiment improved. As a result, foreign warehouse stock was offered at 67 yuan, but no transactions were made. Transit goods were priced at 52.2 yuan. Jardine Matheson’s “B” mark sugar, March arrival, was priced at 71.5 yuan for old stock, and Western warehouse new stock at 71.8 yuan. Yesterday, the Guangdong brokers offered 200 bags of Dongxiang ordinary red sugar at a price of 52 yuan. Yesterday, 5,710 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>

<h3>Re-copying Old Newspapers: 67 Years Ago (461) (See This Newspaper from the 12th Year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Mining in Guizhou Province</p>
<p>Zhao Yuan, believing that Guizhou Province is rich in sand ore, memorialized the court, intending to engage in mining to enrich the country and benefit the people. His memorial stated: "Guizhou Province is all mountains, and the dense Qi should produce various kinds of sand ore. However, the previous mines are already old and depleted. It is difficult for wealthy merchants to come and exploit them, because the treasure is hidden in the ground and cannot be guaranteed to be obtained. People are doubtful, and few are willing to undertake it. When I was serving as the Provincial Treasurer, I once drafted detailed regulations and issued them to attract merchants, but few responded. Furthermore, I selected officials and gentry familiar with mining to conduct surveys in various places. Where ore deposits were found, there was a lack of capital to mine them, leading to many interruptions. Currently, auxiliary funds are insufficient, and the financial situation is precarious. I must seek natural benefits in the midst of unsolvable problems. It has been found that in the area under the jurisdiction of Luo Jiezhou, the Sub-Prefect of Guihua, the mountains of Ma'an, Dabao Cliff, Shatougou, etc., have strong sand Qi, and are surrounded by peaks, with water in the center, posing no hindrance to civilian farmland, residences, or graves. It is proposed that the government should first conduct trial mining to encourage capable gentry and merchants to start mining. I, along with the Chief Secretary and Circuit Intendant, will discuss using idle funds, appoint officials to supervise, and send soldiers to suppress disturbances. If we can be blessed by the court and the mountains and rivers respond, and the mining is successful, in addition to converting the ore into regular revenue, we will also report to the court to levy taxes according to regulations to enrich the treasury. If the mining is unsuccessful, we will stop work to avoid wasting resources. I dare not spare the effort of careful management, but due to the lack of resources and funds in the barren land, it is necessary to do so."</p>

<h3>The Struggle Between Reason and Emotion</h3>
<p>— Ren Wei</p>
<p>According to a report on the 27th, a Shanghai man named Jin Hongcai, due to prolonged unemployment and lack of livelihood, had his wife leave him. He then threw a three-year-old girl into the river (presumably to reduce the burden?), but his skills were poor, and he was discovered by dockworkers, resulting in his arrest and a sentence of two years and several months.</p>
<p>The wife was dissatisfied with her husband's unemployment, which led to quarrels and her departure to seek another path. The father, having no food for himself, abandoned his child. It turns out that human emotions are built on practical life. Should she watch her husband starve to death? Should she leave her husband to find a way to survive? Should she die with the child? Or should she abandon the child to beg for food?</p>
<p>This is similar to the situation of the Sichuan famine a few years ago: a father wanting to kill his son to satisfy his hunger, and a son wanting to kill his father to fill his stomach.</p>
<p>Yes, humans come into the world to live, and that is emotion. But when the world cannot satisfy him, he still wants to find ways to live, regardless of parents, children, regardless of terror, death... everything.</p>
<p>This is the struggle between reason and emotion!</p>
<p>Please allow me to leave a tail. Now this Jin Hongcai has food to eat, within two years and several months.</p>
<h3>The Happiness of Apprentices</h3>
<p>— Cao Lingyou</p>
<p>Speaking of the happiness of apprentices, many people will surely criticize my statement. What happiness can apprentices have? They do lowly work every day, and their monthly income is not even enough to buy daily necessities. They also have to endure the boss's temper and often face his cold looks. Being an apprentice is truly living an inhuman life. Where is the happiness in that? Are you crazy to say apprentices are happy? However, I have some reasons for saying apprentices are happy. As the ancient saying goes, "Only when the year grows cold do we know that pine and cypress are the last to fade." It can be seen that the more adverse the environment, the more those who struggle and succeed deserve to be called heroes and heroines in the world. In today's society, I don't know how many successful people have risen from apprentice to boss. Their struggle is truly admirable! The life of an apprentice is indeed very painful, but if an apprentice is willing not to give up on himself, work hard, and strive forward, then success is within reach.</p>
<p>If you often browse biographies of famous people, then you will be even more convinced that apprentices are happy. Of all the successful people, both ancient and modern, I don't know how many came from apprentice backgrounds. During their apprenticeships, they forged strong wills and magnificent courage. When opportunity arrived, they showed their skills, raised their eyebrows, brought blessings to the masses, and became world-renowned figures. I can easily cite a few facts about famous people to prove my point:</p>
<p>The inventor Edison is probably known to everyone. He invented many things and increased the world's civilization. But he was very poor in his youth. When he was a teenager, he worked in his cousin's factory and suffered abuse from his cousin, so he ran away. He lived a miserable life of unemployment. Fortunately, he came across a good opportunity. The stock market counter was broken, and no one else could fix it, but he fixed it. As a result, he gained the approval of the manager in the stock market, who hired him as a vice engineer. From then on, Edison went smoothly, his life had a purpose, and he eventually became the world's king of invention.</p>
<p>The second person I want to talk about is the world-renowned historian H.G. Wells. He was also the son of a servant woman. As a child, he worked as an apprentice in a small grocery store, getting up at dawn and sleeping late at night, spending all day doing the hard work of sweeping the floor and wiping windows. But later, he devoted himself to learning, made unremitting efforts, and became a world-renowned scholar.</p>
<p>Many people have probably read the autobiography of the American Benjamin Franklin. When he was young, he worked as an apprentice in his brother's printing shop. He took time out from his busy schedule to secretly study classical works and eventually became a writer, politician, and scientist.</p>
<p>I want to list the above three great men</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Hawthorn seemed tempted by my inducement and indeed pointed out something. He said, "How can this woman have so much money? I also have to ask Anna." I said, "Is that even a point? Isn't her money from that sucker Lu Jiansheng being taken for a ride?"</p>
<p>Hawthorn waited a moment, then shook his head slightly. "I don't believe this sucker would be that much of a sucker."</p>
<p>"Why do you say that?"</p>
<p>"Hasn't he recently known that Zhao Boxiong and Wang Lilan are having an affair? I suspect he may not be entirely unaware of her relationship with Yu Gantang either."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh and say, "Hawthorn, your psychological research is indeed very profound, but in my opinion, it's still like a 'flawed encyclopedia'."</p>
<p>At this moment, Hawthorn suddenly slammed on the brakes. I looked up and saw that the red light in the center of the road was on. When the car continued to move, his conversation also had a lingering interest.</p>
<p>He asked me, "What does that mean?" His head kept looking to both sides of the road. I replied, "Your research on the 'sucker psychology' seems to be still incomplete. Shanghai is full of such big shots. On the one hand, they reach out their claws to squeeze the sweat and blood of the common people, but on the other hand, they spend it all on women. They know that their mistresses or illegal cohabitants are hooking up outside, but they can still maintain that kind of 'gentlemanly demeanor' of turning a blind eye and give their all. In fact, this is the law of 'reaping what you sow'!"</p>
<p>Hawthorn didn't seem to hear it, and said to himself, "Ah, this is Songshan Road – that tall building is probably the Kangning Apartment?"</p>
<p>Two seconds later, our car had stopped in front of the eight-story giant building. Hawthorn jumped out of the car first and went straight into the doorman's room of the apartment. After I closed the car door and walked up the stone steps, he came out of the doorman's room and led me into the elevator room. He said, "I have asked, Jiang Anna is upstairs."</p>
<p>"That's for sure. Didn't she say she didn't sleep all night last night?"</p>
<p>The elevator rose to the third floor. As we stepped out of the elevator, I suddenly remembered something and raised my hand to look at my watch. The (61) deeds, are nothing more than to prove that apprentices should not be too pessimistic, but should seize the opportunity to endure, and work hard, then there will always be a day of success. Aren't many celebrities from apprenticeships? The so-called "capable person is like this", I hope those who are apprentices regard themselves as happy. Someone said a very meaningful sentence, he said: "Unfortunately, being born as the son of an official is like being loaded with weight and running a race." This sentence, on the contrary, says that poverty is happiness, and being an apprentice is happiness!</p>
<h3>Thoughts, Sights, and Sounds</h3>
<p>— By Weikang</p>
<p>Because of the soaring prices of everything, everyone is planning everywhere. Even writing a quick letter must use a postcard, because writing a letter once (local) requires two cents for postage, two cents for the envelope, and one cent for the paper, which costs five cents in total. But using a postcard only costs one cent. Therefore, the post office's postcard business is booming, but each person is limited to a maximum of several sheets each time, and more will not be sold, in order to slightly limit it.</p>
<p>In the advertisement column of a certain newspaper, I saw an advertisement for a lost dog, which roughly said: A small white Pekingese dog is lost. If someone finds it and sends it back, a reward of one hundred yuan will be given. At the same time, in this column, I also saw an advertisement for finding a child with a reward of five yuan, which makes people sigh that "humans are inferior to dogs."</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief for Epidemics</h3>

<h3>Not From Shaoxing</h3>
<p>— By Mei</p>
<p>Fundraiser: "Shaoxing is experiencing a rice shortage, and the disaster victims are in urgent need of relief. Your Excellency has always been extremely enthusiastic about good deeds. Please donate some here as well, and your merit will be immeasurable!"</p>
<p>Rich man: "No, I am not from Shaoxing, so I am afraid I cannot comply."</p>

<h3>My View on Li Shengzao</h3>
<p>— By Plum Blossom House Master</p>
<p>Li Hanru (Shengzao) is an outstanding talent of the Fuliancheng Drama School. Among the male leads in this drama school, after Ma Lianliang and Tan Fuying, the one with the most outstanding artistic talent and the highest reputation is Hanru alone. Hanru's art is generally learned from Lianliang. His singing and acting both have similarities. The role of Qiao Xuan in Ganlu Temple is even more like Ma. Not only is his singing the same, but his expressions and movements are also the same. This is due to his extraordinary intelligence, which is something that ordinary people cannot achieve by forced learning. When he first came to Shanghai (with the Tianchan Stage, accompanied by the Sheng generation disciples of Fushe), I watched his plays more than ten times. At that time, Hanru was still young, but his acting skills were already very mature. He and Chen Shengsun co-starred in "Si Lang Visits His Mother," and he and Liu Shenglian co-starred in "Sitting in the Tower Killing Her Husband." Both his singing and acting were excellent, giving the audience a very good impression. I especially appreciated the play "Four Jinshi" that he co-starred with Shenglian, because children who play this kind of acting play often fail to do so stiffly and dryly, while Hanru's performance is impeccable, and he can fully highlight the posture and means of the evil lawyer, which is commendable. The second time he came to the south again, he took the Golden Grand Theater, and his qualifications became more experienced, and his skills also improved accordingly. However, the supporting roles were a bit weak, and he could not show his strengths. This was the fact at the time. How dare I conceal it for Hanru? After returning to the north, he became the main character, and his desire for excellence became more eager. He learned and polished with each other, and only followed what was good, and he worked hard and never stopped learning, so his art has advanced to the Tao. This time, he came back with a vengeance. It is the time for people of ambition to establish a career, and in addition, the female lead, Tong Zhiling, is a new actor who is just starting out, and the martial arts actor Gao Shenglin is even more of a famous role with a solid foundation. With these two people to assist him, the splendor of his performance and the fulfillment of his harvest can be self-evident. What's more, his father, Gao Qingkui, came with him, serving as the stage director and temporary teacher. He will provide more unexpected help in terms of performance. When he takes the stage, I will wait and see.</p>
<h3>Li Qinian's General Reply to Her Supporters</h3>
<p>Li Qinian sent a letter to the Haixing News Agency yesterday, stating that since she came to Shanghai, she has received many letters from her supporters. Among the questions raised, the following three are the most common. Now, she is sending the replies to you and asking you to forward them to various newspapers as a general reply.</p>
<p>(1) "I heard that Ms. Li went to Singapore to perform on stage before coming to Shanghai. Can you tell us the details?"</p>
<p>Answer: "Going to Singapore was a process of performing in the Malay Peninsula. I passed through more than twenty cities in the Malay Peninsula, staying for an average of three to five days or one or two days in each place. This trip was at the invitation of Shaw Brothers Company. Along the way, I also performed on stage to raise funds to relieve refugees. Fortunately, the results were good. The whole process took two months."</p>
<p>(2) "What is the situation of the film industry in Southeast Asia?"</p>
<p>Answer: "Southeast Asia is an excellent overseas market for domestic films. Every film that is released can attract a large audience. Therefore, if filmmakers can provide meaningful productions, they will definitely achieve a great publicity effect."</p>
<p>(3) "What are your opinions on the popular folk story films in Shanghai?"</p>
<p>Answer: "After coming to Shanghai this time, I have received written inquiries from several film publications on this issue. I did not pay attention to folk story films at first, and I have not acted in this type of film in the past. Among the more than ten scripts sent by the Yihua authorities for me to choose from, I have not seen any scripts of this type, so I cannot express any opinions."</p>
<h3>Zhang Eyun After Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— By Meiyu</p>
<p>Zhang Eyun, the master of Zhuchen Pavilion, stopped performing last year. Seeing the special situation in Shanghai, she went to Hong Kong with Meng Xiaodong for a short rest. Unexpectedly, alarming news came frequently, and a storm was brewing.</p>
<p>Revolutionary Pioneer, starring John Wayne and Crane Wilbur, is a thrilling and exciting story full of calls for freedom and national spirit, and is the prelude to the American independence movement.</p>
<h3>How to Shoot a Movie? (II)</h3>
<p>— By Degang</p>
<p>How to start shooting a movie? Before shooting a movie, of course, you must first determine the script. There are many types of scripts, including comedies, tragedies, social dramas, historical dramas, religious dramas, etc. After the director of the film has determined the script, he must turn the empty plot hidden in the ideal into a vivid and colorful object. Being a director is a difficult job, so some people say that the success of a famous film is not due to the leading star, but should be attributed to the director. The first step for the director is to assign different roles in the play according to the personality and talent of each actor, and then determine the scenery. The scenery used in the photography field is much more elaborate than the scenery used in ordinary stages, because the camera lens is like a sophisticated eye, and it will not easily ignore any smallest point. The construction of the scenery is also done by experts, who can use paper and wood to make all kinds of things, such as bulky cannons, majestic warships, and towering palace buildings. After the scenery is ready, you can start shooting. During the shooting, the director先生 stares intently at directing the work, correcting the actors' expressions, postures, movements, dialogues, etc., especially the movements. Generally, inexperienced actors always move too fast, which does not meet the requirements of filming. Because too fast movements appear discontinuous to the audience in the film, which is not very beautiful.</p>
<p>In a film, there are often many scenes that take place in the same location or under the same scenery. In order to save manpower and resources, scenes with the same scenery location but not connected in sequence can be filmed at the same time, and then the films of these unconnected scenes can be cut apart, and after the other scenes have been filmed, the films can be connected one by one in sequence with glue. During the shooting, no matter how attentive the director is, and how hard the actors are working, there are always many sections of the film that are not satisfactory after the shooting, and need to be cut and reshot. Therefore, the length of the film that is cut and reshot is many times longer than the wooden film. For example, a film that is 1,800 or 2,000 meters long when it is shown in a movie theater is at least 10,000 meters long when it is being made. You can imagine how huge the loss of the film is!</p>
<p>Hong Kong is not a paradise either, so she had to replan her return. She bought a boat and returned to China, and arrived safely in Shanghai a few days ago. She still lives near Foch Road. Since returning to Shanghai, Eyun has had little contact with the outside world. She often reads books and writes to pass the time. In terms of scripts, she has only dabbled in Yu Shuang's "Yanzi Jian". This month, she may return to the West Lake for a few weeks, and then go to Tianjin and Gubei, and make a decision on whether to perform or not.</p>

<h3>Twenty Kinds of Suzhou Ballad (16) Rebirth</h3>

<p>Ending with a "grand reunion" seems to have become a stereotyped formula for Suzhou ballad novels (Dream of the Red Chamber and Romance of the West Chamber can be deeply rooted in the hearts of the people, precisely because they do not fall into common routines in this regard). "Rebirth" of course could not avoid the cliché.</p>
<p>The structure is slightly scattered, and it seems not easy to please when set to music.</p>
