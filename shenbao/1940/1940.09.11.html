<h3 id="c8">美蘇合作基礎的檢討 <a href="#c8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>近幾天來紛紛傳說美蘇在遠東合作談判的消息、還沒有正面的證實；但直到現在爲止，沒有像歷次訛傳英蘇談判，蘇日談判等等、由莫斯科當局授權塔斯社予以鄭重之吾認。倘若由這一方式來推想所傳的不虛，則舉世殷殷期待美蘇合作的國際盛舉，或可望不久之後，會一朝予世人以共見。</p>
<p>去年九月，歐洲戰事追隨遠東戰事而分頭並進之後，全世界大部份國家所傾向的壁壘，及其相互間的種種關係，大體都已經相當明顯了；其間最不分明的，要算美蘇兩國間的關係。爲了美蘇關係的捉摸不定，於是關於英蘇改進邦交的是否可能？現存的蘇德友好會繼續多久，會演進到什麼程度？這些莫大疑問沒有人敢加以肯定的推斷；甚至，連蘇日接近那樣一望而知的謠言，也幾乎沒有人敢論斷其不可能。換一方面說；美蘇之間的未來關係，到底是進一步的合作，或是普通的友好，或是持續其向來的冷淡，或甚至於磨擦翻臉而竟公然的敵對？或是或非，一出一入，將使全世界未來命運受其莫大的影響。</p>
<p>我們熱烈的期待美蘇兩國爲了世界的幸福而各捐成見，和諧合作，來挽救人類更慘酷的刧運；但我們不敢輕作樂觀的觀察。排除了樂觀或悲觀，試作客觀的分析，則有可得而言者：即號稱資本主義國家領袖的美國，與以社會主義爲根盤的蘇聯，兩者體制上，本質上存著必然的敵對因素。祗從這一點來說，要是兩國間要建立比普通友好史進一步的合作關係，必須另具其他堅實的基礎。再從客觀的檢討，有無何種因素，足爲其基礎以促成兩國的合作？</p>
<p>第一，先從是否需要方面看。溯自德義日反共公約簽訂之後，一直到去年蘇德締結互不侵犯協定的前夕，其間爲了掩護自己的安全，蘇聯迫切的需要與英美合作；可是牠所發動的所謂國際反侵略陣綫，却自始至終受了美國方面的冷遇；而央國適逢褊狹而短見的頑固派當國，並且更進一步，夢想着醞釀一個英法德義排擠蘇聯的所謂一四强公的」。慕尼黑會議是其露骨的初慕。於是被迫着，蘇聯就不得不大開大闔，一舉而與德國締的交歡，根本摧毀了國際的反蘇陣綫。及至現在，西方的德義方在出死力與英國互搏，東方的日本又被中國的血戰所絆住；蘇聯原來所感受東西兩面的威脅，至少現在是鬆弛了。假使歐亞兩戰局，長此拖延，相持不下，則在此時期之內，蘇聯實際上不需要向外結交與國，形成何種陣綫。可是兩戰局可能的拖延到幾時？戰局怎樣結束纔於蘇聯有利？怎樣結束將使蘇聯感受莫大的新威脅？這是蘇聯當局在目前所必已攷慮的大問題。不但玫慮，且爲亟須未雨綢繆，爭着先鞭的問題，如此分析，竊信美蘇兩國體制上與本質上的矛盾，斷乎不夠抵銷兩國密切合作的需要！</p>
<p>第二，從廣泛的企圖方面看。事實的例證，有如日本脅迫越南，兼其三意義：（一）經濟的意義在於攫取越南資源，（二）國際的意義在於壓迫英國以見好於德義，（三）表面的意義在於加緊對華侵略，其實祗是一二兩項的烟慕而已。放遠一些來看，日本侵越倘若如願以償，倘若順遂的進展，則絕對無疑的別有兩項前途；一是對美爭覇太牛洋的憑藉，一是對蘇反共公约的復活。這是將來的可能的趨歸，却是最近將來的惡化的根苗。美蘇兩國當然洞鑒及此，但至目前爲止，兩國間還有其由來甚久的隔閡與懷疑。即美國所疑於蘇聯的，蘇聯在遠東沒有政治企圖嗎，在歐洲不持續其反英美的企圖嗎？蘇聯所懷疑於美國的，美國在遠東沒有攘奪歐洲戰敗國在亞洲利益爲己有的企圖嗎，在歐洲沒有鼓勵英國頑固派的企圖嗎？這些懷疑，是美蘇兩國間旣往的隔閡所在，亦爲兩國今後合作的魔障所在。假定兩國不事肅淸這些懷疑，則未能消弭種種隔閡，亦即無法建樹合作關係。不但如此，隔閡與懷疑所在，內而衝動，外而鼓煽，將有與合作相反而發展的可能。不幸而如此發展，則非兩國同時各自孤立而各受嚴重威脅，即是兩國牽入漩渦而形成無可再大的世界大戰。故隔閡之消弭與吾，懷疑之肅淸與吾，是合作與敵對的岐途；吾們無從逆知美蘇兩國對此岐途將在事實上如何取舍，然吾們從旁冷觀其利害得失，深覺兩國有其披肝瀝胆，戮力同心的理由。</p>
<p>上述兩點，是從美蘇兩國將來共通的遭遇與歸宿，廻溯以求目前合作的基礎所在，從此兩基礎，推想其進展合作的速度，則以美蘇兩國，或兩國中的一國，對於歐亞兩戰局究將持續多久的見解，成反比例；即愈認爲戰局必久，則進展合作愈緩，若認爲戰局有急轉直下的可能，則合作的實現，理應爲期不遠。</p>

<p>（三）强迫剩餘款項，投資於重要國家企業，如煤炭提煉煤油工業，人造橡皮工業，及國內無利可圖的礦業等。</p>
<p>（四）統制一切新工廠商店，使其盡力國防工業，與國防工業無關者，則禁止其設立，禁止其發展。</p>
<p>（五）各項工業。皆在政府究全統制之下，工廠之出貨，原料及外滙，皆由政府支配。</p>
<p>（六）所有資金市塲，銀行和保險公司財源及公司基金，均由政府以種種方法，予以借用　。</p>
<p>（七）各公司經理董事的薪金，皆加限制。</p>
<p>對勞工方面：（一）根據一九三二年經濟恐慌時代核减的工資，約加調整，使工人有固定工資。</p>
<p>（二）統制各種職業，徵發工人從事國防有關各項工業，禁止工人改就工資較高的工作。</p>
<p>（三）工人無罷工權利，並禁止設立一切獨立工會，全國工人皆須加入勞工陣綫，這是國社黨的機關，其組織是包括僱主與勞工。</p>
<p>對於消費者方面：（一）在「大砲代替牛汕」口號之下，實際上一切食糧及一切日用品，早已實行計口授糧制，人民生活程度减低，達於營養不良狀態。</p>
<p>（二）用政府直接分配及宣傳消費國內出產豐富的食糧，以節約消費。</p>
<p>對於農民方面，則固定價格及統制市塲，强迫農民將一切物產，定期交與特種統制機關。</p>
<p>德國此種制度看起來十分嚴峻，但也不無利益。失業問題總算解決。工業生產指數，在一九三二年爲五十四，至一九三九年六月，已升高至一三七；農業生產，在一九三二年爲一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克，至一九三九年已增加至一四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克；國民收入，在一九三二年爲四五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克，至一九三九年增加至一〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克；受雇工人在一九三二年一月爲一二·五〇〇·〇〇〇人，至戰爭爆發前巳增至二二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇人；失業人數，在一九三三年一月爲六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇人强，到了現在，工人反極缺乏，不得不向被征服民族，僱用一部分工人了。</p>
<p>德國工人的待遇，在好多方面，比較以前已略改進；例如工人休假。可以照常支薪；如遇解僱，或被侮辱，可向勞工法院起訴；工人娛樂時間也已增多。另一方面，工廠如果缺乏原料，或工人，致實行减工，廠主便可獲得工業自助金，及局部解儷。</p>
<p>農民亦可獲得低利借款，便宜的肥料，及其他供給。農產品的價格，也比之世界市塲要高，其中美中不足者，仍爲食糧的恐慌，不能解除。</p>
<p>當希特勒獲得政權之初，不獨有大批失業工人，並須與馬克思主義派的無產階級奮鬥。希特勒解決了失業問題，同時也總算局部實現了德國人民心理的改造。但德國的生殖率，在一九三三年爲九七一·〇〇〇人，至去年已增加至一·四二〇·〇〇〇人，在人力方面，除蘇聯外，在歐洲可謂佔第一位。希特勒還有兩個最大障碍必須克服，就是原料的缺乏。及黃金與流動資本的缺乏，以扶助他的擴軍計劃。</p>
<p>德國對於原料不足的補救辦法，不外三種：</p>
<p>（一）全部對外貿易，尤其是各種輸入，皆在嚴格統制之下，每項國際貿易的成交，皆須政府批准，非必需品的輸入，須作爲德國出口的交換品的始准進口。此項新計劃係於一九三四年七月付諸實施，規定德國與他國貿易，彼此進出口必須平衡，因此每一個國家欲與德國交易者，同時須向德國購貨，卽使該項貨物無購進之必要，亦得如此。</p>
<p>（二）按照各種生產對於國家需要的緩急，實行原料的嚴格分配。</p>
<p>（三）大量利用其國內原料，以發展代替品，如從煤中提煉煤油，從煤及石灰中提煉橡膠，從木材中提煉紡織纖維；同時不惜成本，開發國內質量均差的鐵沙等鑛藏，並從各方面設法節省原料。「四年計劃」的重要目的卽在於此，也就是德國盡量完成自給自足政策，免爲封鎖所困的開端。德國此項政策的成功，可於其軍火製造方面見之，德國軍火的生產，在此次戰爭開始時，比較一九一三年超過兩倍。</p>
<p>根據最有利於德國的統計，德國可從國內資源，獲得三分之二的必要原料，所缺乏的，乃幾項重要的基本金屬，必須不惜任何高價，向國外輸入</p>
<p>四年計劃實行之後，各工廠的生產均已增加。至於農業生產增加運動却並不怎樣成功。德國事實上不是增加生產，而是减少消費，達於營養不良的地步。德國食物的自給自足程度，在一九三二年爲百分之七五，至戰爭爆發時，已增至百分之八二，但國內脂肪，仍缺乏百分之五十以上。</p>
<p>在財政問題方面，德國所用的解決方法如下：</p>
<p>（一）曾於一九三三年六月宜佈停付外債利息，每年可節省一·二〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克。此項辦法，可使德國國內金錢，不致漏至國外，而國外則可由輸出，海運及其他事業所獲得的金錢，留作購買國外原料之用。這樣一來，德國旣可購買大宗貶値的德國股票，値美金一元者，只須以幾分錢購進，又可津貼出口貨，更因德國對外僓務人皆以不流通的馬克償付外債，德國政府，因此卽有大宗現款，供其直接支配。債權國爲應付此項不利形勢，也實行貨幣减値。</p>
<p>（二）德國又用其獨一無二的籌款方法，發行證券及用種種羅掘方法，籌措款項。德國各省各市各機關的借款在一九三三年爲二四·三〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克，現已增至八〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克以上，據若干人估計，還不止此數，認爲德國公債已達一〇〇〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克以上，簡直與上次大戰中四年累積的債款一六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克，不相上下</p>
<p>但德國的鈔票流通額，在一九三三年以後，也增加油了三倍，並有一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克的額外鈔票，與好幾兆的公債。德國國內金準備奇缺，爲數不過百分之一。因此德國馬克，雖在國內，因法定價格關係，保持穩定，但在國外，實際上毫無價値。</p>
<p>（三）大規模擴軍計劃所造成的經濟繁榮，也使政府金錢的支出，由嚴厲的稅收制度中，收回一部分。一九三二年全國稅收佔總收入百分之廿五，現已增加至百分之四十七左右，各種苛捐雜稅在一九三二年共達一四·一三一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克，至今年已增至三一·〇〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克。</p>
<p>德國全部戰時機構，不問在工業方面，抑在軍事方面，業已羅掘俱窮，如此情况，能繼續多久而不致崩潰，却自是一問題。但由德國補充能力觀之，德國已將整個的歐洲資源置於其支配之下。如果英國封鎖整個歐洲大陸，以待德國餓斃，或發生革命推翻國社黨政府，則德國報紙早巳說明，受痛苦者並非德國。</p>
<p>要之，戰爭至現階段已變爲大陸控制與大陸封鎖兩大勢力的對抗，對坑勝敗如何，尚非目前所能逆睹。（本篇完）</p>

<p>Chungking: According to recent news received regarding the situation in Vietnam, it is hinted that although the French-Japanese negotiations are still continuing in Hanoi, Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam has expressed agreement with most of Japan's demands. Only one or two points are still under discussion. According to intelligence received here, it is generally believed that Decoux will eventually accept the remaining points, and it is thought that Decoux may have adopted a firm stance some time ago, but after Vichy pressured him to accept Japan's demands, there are now signs of gradual concessions. As for the claim that Decoux may refuse Vichy's instructions, most people here do not believe it. It is said that Decoux and the Pétain government may have different opinions on certain points, but the opportunity to openly resist Vichy's orders seems still very distant. It is also disbelieved here that American bombers have flown to Vietnam. Although the situation in Vietnam appears calm on the surface, the Chinese continue to closely monitor its development. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chungking: This morning's Executive Yuan meeting discussed the Vietnam issue in great detail and decided on measures to deal with it. (10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to reliable sources, negotiations between the French authorities in Vietnam and Major General Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese inspection team, are currently ongoing. It is heard that Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam has proposed a counter-proposal regarding Japan's demand to pass troops through Vietnam to the Chinese border, which was then sent to Tokyo by Nishihara for instructions. It is said that the Governor-General's counter-proposal seeks to restrict and designate the landing points for Japanese troops, the areas where Japanese troops can engage in military operations, and the locations to be used as air force bases. Chinese sources commented on this news, saying that they firmly believe that the Chinese military authorities have completed meticulous preparations to deal with all contingencies. However, if Vietnam allows Japanese troops to land, no matter how the areas of activity are technically stipulated, it will gradually become impossible to restrict the Japanese military's actions. As a result, Vietnam's independence seems to be under serious threat. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chungking: Reliable foreign sources claim that, according to direct news from Vietnam, Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam has a firm attitude in negotiations with Japan and is prepared to resist the landing of Japanese troops. However, Vichy, apparently under German influence, is said to be exerting strong pressure on Decoux to accept Japan's demands. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Kunming: The claim that France has accepted Japan's demand to pass troops through Vietnam has not yet been confirmed here. French officials here have received a telegram signed by Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam, stating that there is no news regarding this compromise. Chinese officials have also not received information from Vietnam on this matter. It is said that they have received news stating that a small team of Japanese troops intruded into French territory near Dong Dang twice last week. The first time, the French side issued a warning. The second time, on September 7, more than a dozen armed Japanese soldiers crossed the border. The French side disarmed them and escorted them out of the country. It is heard that Nishihara, the leader of the Japanese inspection team, formally apologized to the French authorities for this accidental incident. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi: French-Japanese negotiations here were suspended on Saturday morning, but it is expected that they will resume today. The resumption of negotiations will depend on the orders from Tokyo. Tokyo's attitude may change depending on the impact of Germany's actions in Europe on the Far East. (10th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva: Regarding the situation in Annam, the "Petit Parisien" newspaper yesterday published an official statement saying, "Regarding the various contradictory rumors circulating about the French-Japanese negotiations in Annam, the French authorities neither deny nor confirm them, only stating that although these rumors are close to the truth, they often contain prejudice. The more accurate fact is that the establishment of the Franco-German armistice will have some impact on the situation in the Far East. We can still remember that the British withdrew their garrison from Tianjin and Shanghai and went on to start friendly negotiations with Japan. The attitude of the United States can be understood from the recent statement by the US Secretary of State, which expressed a desire to maintain the status quo in the Far East. As far as France is concerned, it has always maintained friendly relations with Japan, so its purpose is to find a permanent basis to prevent the Sino-Japanese war from spreading to Annam. The negotiations in Tokyo between the French Ambassador to Japan, Henri, and the Japanese Foreign Minister, Matsuoka, started from this point. At the same time, negotiations between Lieutenant General Decoux and General Nishihara are also being held in Annam. The negotiations in Hanoi aim to find possible ways to implement the discussions in Tokyo. The negotiations in Hanoi often provoke erroneous comments. In fact, the negotiations between the two sides have never been interrupted, and they are now striving for a solution that satisfies both sides. It can now be assumed that Japan's interests are in line with France's interests. In accordance with the provisions of the armistice, France's task is to manage its interests." (10th Reuter dispatch)</p>
<p>Hanoi: After the new French Colonial Minister, Rear Admiral Platon, took office, Governor-General Decoux of Vietnam sent a telegram of respect today, expressing that all the monarchs and people of Vietnam are united in their loyalty to France. The message stated, "On behalf of the monarchs of all protectorates and the people of Vietnam, and in my personal name, I assure you that all of Vietnam is completely loyal to France. Although the current general situation is unstable, Vietnam will be able to maintain calmness, unity, and discipline." Colonial Minister Platon replied with a telegram of thanks, which stated, "I am very pleased to receive your telegram. Vietnam's loyalty to France is particularly important in the current circumstances. The government and Marshal Pétain have complete trust in you. I am very happy to hear that the people of Vietnam are calm as usual and united under your leadership." In addition, Lieutenant General Decoux hosted a banquet at noon today to entertain the chief Japanese representative, General Nishihara, and invited many important French and Japanese figures to attend.

<p>Chungking: Authoritative Chinese sources say that ninety Japanese warships and one hundred and fifty Japanese aircraft have been concentrated in the Hainan Island area. The Vietnamese government has ordered the evacuation of European women and children from border cities to the interior. However, French-Japanese negotiations are still ongoing in Hanoi.

<p>Chungking: According to Chinese sources, the Eighth Route Army mobilized the strength of 105 regiments this time and launched an attack on the Japanese army in various parts of North China, and has captured 46 large and small strongholds. The motive for this offensive was that the Japanese army transferred some troops from within the country and outside the customs to cooperate with the troops currently fighting in China, and concentrated them in southern Shanxi, Hankou, and Hainan Island respectively, in an attempt to carry out a strategic general offensive in order to end the war. Therefore, the Eighth Route Army preemptively launched a counter-attack to contain them. Because the autumn harvest is imminent, in order to prevent the Japanese army from destroying crops, an offensive was adopted to protect the harvest. (9th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Chungking: According to military sources, after the Chinese army in North China captured the Chinghsing coal mining area, it completely destroyed all the machinery, electrical equipment, railways, and houses of the new mine in Dongwangsher, and diverted water to flood the mine shafts to a depth of more than twenty feet. The old and new mine shafts of Kangling were connected, so the old mine was also submerged at the same time. All the coal stored in the mining area was doused with kerosene and set ablaze. The raging flames soared into the sky and have not yet been extinguished. It is heard that the destroyed machinery was all made in Germany and was worth 30 million yuan according to pre-war prices. The installation process also takes half a year. The Chinghsing coal mine is one of the famous mining areas in North China, covering an area of 400 square li and producing more than 6,000 tons of coal per day. (10th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">Reviewing the Basis of U.S.-Soviet Cooperation <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, news of U.S.-Soviet cooperation negotiations in the Far East has been circulating, but there has been no positive confirmation. Up to now, there has been no formal denial by the TASS news agency authorized by the Moscow authorities, as in the case of previous rumors of British-Soviet negotiations, Soviet-Japanese negotiations, etc. If we infer from this that what is being spread is true, then the international event of U.S.-Soviet cooperation, which the world is eagerly awaiting, may be realized before long and be witnessed by all.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European war last September, following the war in the Far East, the camps to which most countries in the world have tended and the various relationships between them have generally become quite clear. The most unclear of these is the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. Because of the uncertainty of U.S.-Soviet relations, the following major questions cannot be confidently inferred: Is it possible for British-Soviet relations to improve? How long will the existing Soviet-German friendship continue, and to what extent will it evolve? Even rumors of Soviet-Japanese rapprochement, which are obvious at a glance, are almost impossible to judge. On the other hand, what will be the future relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union? Will it be further cooperation, or ordinary friendship, or continued coldness, or even friction and turning against each other and even open hostility? The future fate of the world will be greatly affected by whether it is one way or the other.</p>
<p>We earnestly hope that the United States and the Soviet Union will put aside their prejudices and cooperate harmoniously for the happiness of the world to save mankind from even more cruel disasters. However, we dare not make optimistic observations lightly. Setting aside optimism or pessimism, and trying to make an objective analysis, there are some things that can be said: that is, the United States, known as the leader of capitalist countries, and the Soviet Union, based on socialism, have inherent hostile factors in their systems and essence. From this point alone, if the two countries want to establish a cooperative relationship that is more advanced than ordinary friendship, they must have other solid foundations. From an objective review, are there any factors that can serve as a foundation to promote cooperation between the two countries?</p>
<p>First, let's look at whether there is a need. Since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact by Germany, Italy, and Japan, until the eve of the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact last year, the Soviet Union urgently needed to cooperate with Britain and the United States in order to protect its own security. However, the so-called international anti-aggression front that it launched has been met with cold treatment from the United States from beginning to end. Britain happened to have narrow-minded and short-sighted stubborn elements in power, and even dreamed of brewing a "four-power pact" of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to squeeze out the Soviet Union. The Munich Conference was its blatant beginning. Therefore, the Soviet Union was forced to make a big move and conclude a deal with Germany in one fell swoop, fundamentally destroying the international anti-Soviet front. Now that Germany and Italy in the West are doing their best to fight against Britain, and Japan in the East is tied down by the bloody war in China, the threats that the Soviet Union originally felt from both East and West have at least been eased for now. If the two war situations in Europe and Asia are prolonged for a long time without resolution, then during this period, the Soviet Union actually does not need to form alliances with other countries to form any kind of front. However, how long can the two war situations possibly be delayed? How will the war end in a way that benefits the Soviet Union? How will it end in a way that poses a great new threat to the Soviet Union? These are major issues that the Soviet authorities must have already considered. Not only consider, but also need to plan ahead and compete for the lead. With this analysis, I firmly believe that the contradictions in the system and essence of the United States and the Soviet Union are not enough to offset the need for close cooperation between the two countries!</p>
<p>Second, let's look at the broad attempts. The factual examples, such as Japan's coercion of Vietnam, have three meanings: (1) The economic significance lies in seizing Vietnamese resources, (2) The international significance lies in oppressing Britain to curry favor with Germany and Italy, and (3) The superficial significance lies in intensifying the aggression against China. In fact, only the first two items are a smokescreen. Looking further afield, if Japan's invasion of Vietnam is as desired, and if it progresses smoothly, then there is absolutely no doubt that there will be two other prospects: one is a basis for competing with the United States for hegemony in the Pacific, and the other is the revival of the Anti-Comintern Pact against the Soviet Union. These are the possible trends in the future, but they are the roots of deterioration in the near future. The United States and the Soviet Union certainly understand this, but up to now, there are still long-standing estrangements and suspicions between the two countries. That is, the United States suspects that the Soviet Union has no political ambitions in the Far East, and that it will not continue its anti-British and anti-American attempts in Europe. The Soviet Union suspects that the United States has no intention of seizing the interests of defeated European countries in Asia for itself, and that it has no intention of encouraging stubborn elements in Britain. These suspicions are the source of past estrangements between the United States and the Soviet Union, and they are also the obstacles to future cooperation between the two countries. Assuming that the two countries do not try to eliminate these suspicions, they will fail to eliminate various estrangements, and thus will not be able to establish cooperative relations. Not only that, but the existence of estrangements and suspicions, inwardly, will cause impulses, and outwardly, will instigate, which may lead to developments that are contrary to cooperation. If it develops unfortunately, either the two countries will isolate themselves at the same time and each be seriously threatened, or the two countries will be drawn into the vortex and form an even greater world war. Therefore, the elimination of estrangements and the elimination of suspicions are the crossroads of cooperation and hostility. We have no way of knowing how the United States and the Soviet Union will actually choose at this crossroads, but we feel deeply that the two countries have reasons to be frank with each other and work together wholeheartedly.</p>
<p>The above two points are to trace back from the common future encounters and destinations of the United States and the Soviet Union to seek the basis for current cooperation. From these two bases, to speculate on the speed of its progress and cooperation, it is inversely proportional to the views of the United States and the Soviet Union, or one of the two countries, on how long the two war situations in Europe and Asia will last. That is, the more they believe that the war situation will last for a long time, the slower the progress of cooperation. If they believe that the war situation may take a turn for the worse, then the realization of cooperation should not be far away.</p>

<p>Washington: After President Roosevelt signed the $5,251,000,000 bill last night to fund the two-ocean navy and a 2 million-man army, the Navy immediately announced that it had ordered the construction of 201 new warships, totaling $3,861,000,000, to establish a two-ocean navy larger than the combined navies of Japan, Italy, Germany, and the Soviet Union. This is the largest number of new ships ordered at one time in US naval history. According to naval sources, the orders include 7 battleships, 8 aircraft carriers, 27 cruisers, 115 destroyers, 43 submarines, and 1 repair ship. The Navy Department also stated that it is currently signing contracts to expand naval equipment, requiring an additional $31,653,000 in funding, and is negotiating the purchase of 2,400 aircraft. When various negotiations are completed in the future, the Navy Department will use a total of $4,000,706,000. According to the announcement in Congress last night, the seven new battleships each have a displacement of 45,000 tons. There are now a total of twelve American battleships under construction or on order. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: The contract for the US Navy to order 201 new ships was signed yesterday. After these 201 warships are built, the United States will have a two-ocean fleet with a total tonnage twice the size of the current largest fleet. The decision to make this deal was only three hours later than President Roosevelt's signing of the supplementary national defense funding bill. Because Europe and Asia are in danger of falling entirely into the sphere of influence of totalitarian countries, it has to be dealt with quickly. According to the allocation of the above-mentioned new bill, the shipbuilding cost is nearly 4 billion US dollars, and the rest is used to manufacture 18,000 aircraft and to establish and equip an army of 1.2 million men. It will take four or five years for such a huge fleet to be completed, but small ships can start shipping in one or one and a half years. By the end of 1944, the entire US Navy will have 658 warships with a total tonnage of about 7 million. (10th International News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington: The US-Canada Joint Defense Committee reopened its meeting here yesterday to continue studying military cooperation plans in the event of an invasion of the Western Hemisphere. New York Mayor LaGuardia, chairman of the committee, said yesterday that the discussions were progressing very quickly. It is heard that this discussion includes considering the proposal to sell old American tanks to Canada. Other points discussed include the plan for the United States to establish naval and air bases in Newfoundland. Well-informed sources also said that the Joint Defense Committee is considering another suggestion to allow the United States to establish a new naval base on the west coast of Canada, facing the Pacific Ocean.

After the American crew lowered the American flag, the British Marines lined up and boarded the ship.

<p>Hong Kong: Tokyo News: The personnel changes in the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs are now being implemented one after another. In the third change of diplomats, Tatekawa, the ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kurihara, the ambassador to Turkey, and Yoshizawa, the minister to Canada, are at the center. At this point, one-third of the personnel changes scheduled by Matsuoka have been completed. Lieutenant General Tatekawa's appointment as ambassador to the Soviet Union is the beginning of Japan's selection of ambassadors from the private sector. (10th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The new Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu, recently told reporters that he will have a heartfelt conversation with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on improving Japanese-Soviet relations. Although he does not like communism, he loves the frankness and honesty of the Russians. He has spent a total of thirteen years overseas, including six years in the United Kingdom. He firmly believes that he can get along very well with the Soviet Union. This military diplomat served as the captain of the cavalry during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 and made great achievements in battle. The first time he went to Moscow was in 1911 when he was passing through the city on his way to London. He has since been to Moscow four more times, but each time he only stayed for two days due to his duties. When he was the director of the General Staff Headquarters, he made friends with Soviet military attachés such as Primakov, but these Soviet officers were all executed in the Tukhachevsky case, so he has no old acquaintances in the Soviet Union at present. Tatekawa firmly supports the government's foreign policy. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The government's selection of retired Lieutenant General Tatekawa Yoshitsugu as ambassador to the Soviet Union has been approved by newspapers in the capital. The "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" stated that the officer had represented the New East Asia Federation and requested a revision of foreign policy, so it was most appropriate to appoint him as ambassador to the Soviet Union at this time. The "Asahi Shimbun" mentioned that Molotov recently stated at the Supreme Committee meeting that the Soviet Union was willing to ally with Japan, so the selection of Lieutenant General Tatekawa as ambassador to the Soviet Union was of great importance. The newspaper hoped that the Konoe Cabinet would select new members to fill the vacancies left by the recent recall of diplomatic representatives, and then proceed with its diplomatic offensive. The "Kokumin Shimbun" stated that the development of the situation between Japan and the Soviet Union was worthy of careful attention. Lieutenant General Tatekawa was the leader of the New East Asia Federation, was extremely pro-Soviet, and would also have Nishihara Takehiko as his assistant. Nishihara had previously served as a counselor at the Moscow Embassy and was familiar with the situation regarding the fisheries and oil concession disputes, so he would definitely be able to fulfill the mission happily. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that the government's redetermination of its diplomatic position was aimed at replacing the pro-British and pro-American elements in the old school with experienced and unyielding diplomats who embraced reformism.

<p>Chongqing: Vice President Kong telegraphed the provincial governors and mayors in the morning, urging them to complete the establishment of savings corps by the 15th of this month. The thrift and savings movement for national reconstruction, under the personal leadership of Chairman Chiang, has been smoothly launched. The Thrift and Savings Corps for National Reconstruction was established on the 6th of this month. Now, in order to accelerate progress and achieve rapid results, Kong, the Chief Corps Leader, telegraphed the provincial governors and mayors on the 9th, requesting that they complete the establishment of savings corps by September 15th. The original telegram is excerpted below: (Titles omitted). "I have received a handwritten instruction from the Chairman on the 2nd, instructing that from (September 18th) to the Double Tenth Festival, an active thrift and savings movement for national reconstruction should be launched. During this period, savings corps should be universally established in all provinces, cities, and counties across the country, with the mandatory goal of each citizen saving a minimum of one to five yuan per month. Furthermore, (he) instructed to consider competition methods, and to detail award methods for groups or individuals with particularly large savings amounts." "The National Thrift and Savings Promotion Committee for National Reconstruction, recently established by the Four Banks Joint Treasury, in order to expand the promotion of savings, jointly initiated the organization of the Thrift and Savings Corps for National Reconstruction with the National Thrift and Savings Movement Committee for National Reconstruction established by the Central Propaganda Department, with the Chairman personally serving as Honorary Chief Corps Leader, and your brother (Kong) serving as Chief Corps Leader. Chu Cang, Jingzhi, Yuejun, Cixiu, Xueting, Wenbo, and other brothers serve as Deputy Chief Corps Leaders. Leaders of various ministries and commissions of the Central Government, various provincial governments, and various military units are invited to serve as corps leaders and organize savings corps. You are invited to serve as the corps leader for your province. The invitation letter and detailed regulations have been mailed. Now, following the Chairman's handwritten instructions to expedite the process, please quickly organize savings corps, and instruct all departments, bureaus, cities, counties, and groups to widely establish branch corps, ensuring that all are completed by September 15th, so that savings competitions can be carried out as scheduled in accordance with the instructions. It is also hoped that you will instruct them to consult with local four banks and postal savings and remittance bureaus at any time. Furthermore, thrift and savings are effective methods for absorbing idle funds and stabilizing prices. The Chairman pays extraordinary attention to this, so it is hoped that you will do your utmost to supervise the implementation, promote it widely, and report the progress of the promotion by telegram at any time. Your brother, Kong Xiangxi." Also, in Chongqing, the Savings Corps is expected to be established within days after continuous negotiations since the establishment of the savings promotion sub-committee. It is said that a meticulous plan has been formulated to ensure that everyone has the opportunity to participate. In recent days, various ministries and commissions of the Central Government have dispatched cadres from the thrift movement association and the savings promotion committee to explain the key points of widely establishing branch corps and assist in the process, which is also extremely active. Furthermore, they have all stated that although the staff of the party, government, and military are extremely poor, they should still do their best to advocate and set an example for society. The Naval Headquarters has specially sent Director Luo to the savings promotion committee to discuss the process, which shows the united efforts and cooperation of the party, government, military, and all sectors of society in this movement, and the expected results are very promising.

<p>London: Yesterday afternoon and evening, the Germans continued to heavily attack London. German bomber squadrons dropped many 500-pound bombs on the center of London. London issued air raid alarms twice yesterday. The second one lasted for nine hours and twenty minutes, from 8:30 PM last night until 5:40 AM this morning when it was lifted. At least fifty-two German aircraft were shot down yesterday, and thirteen British aircraft are missing. However, it is now known that three pilots previously reported missing have safely escaped. In the air battles on Saturday and Sunday, a total of 103 German aircraft were shot down. A joint communique issued by the Ministry of Aviation and the Ministry of Internal Security stated that the Germans have now removed the pretense that bombing is limited to military targets. According to reports received last night, German aircraft indiscriminately dropped bombs over London without any purpose. Many bombs fell within the city and caused fires. Some fell near St. Paul's Cathedral and Guildhall, but it is reported that the cathedral was not damaged. A large maternity hospital was bombed, but fortunately, all patients were evacuated fifteen minutes before the hospital was hit, so there were no casualties. Densely populated areas in the east of London were repeatedly heavily bombed. Several of the city's largest buildings, including several houses on Fleet Street, were cracked and damaged. Residential areas in other parts of Britain were also hit by many bombs last night. Material damage in the shipyard areas was very significant, and many fires that started on Saturday night were reignited on Sunday night. The number of casualties in London last night has not yet been determined. The number of casualties from the German air raid on Sunday night was 286 dead and approximately 1,400 seriously injured. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Exhausted Londoners, after nine hours and twenty minutes of continuous bombing by German aircraft, bravely went to work this morning amidst an environment of water gushing from burst water pipes, destroyed tram tracks, and shards of broken glass scattered all over the ground, and streets and alleys filled with smoke. Hundreds of thousands of Londoners were forced to work. With every step they took, they uttered words of hatred for the Germans. According to the Ministry of Aviation, although German bombs fell on London like rain, they did not damage any military equipment. Piles of rubble and collapsed walls are everywhere in London, a scene of devastation, which is evidence of the barbarous actions of German aircraft this morning and tonight, and the most urgent air raid since the beginning of the war. The severity of the casualties is heartbreaking. The famous St. Paul's Cathedral and the area near the Guildhall were heavily on fire. A large maternity hospital was targeted by German aircraft, resulting in countless deaths and injuries. In addition to dropping heavy bombs, German aircraft also dropped "Molotov breadbasket" bombs, causing the capital's streets to be riddled with holes. Water pipes were also bombed, and water sprayed from the broken pipes into the streets. Tram tracks on the streets were also destroyed, and the streets were filled with potholes, causing traffic congestion. (10th United Press)</p>
<p>London: A British official wireless broadcast declared that informed observers believe that this month is the most critical autumn of the war. London and other densely populated areas must still endure night raids. British experts are now working hard to intercept German night raiders flying at speeds of up to 300 miles per hour, but this problem has not yet reached a satisfactory solution. The Daily Mail today carried a message stating that the British Ministry of Aviation believes that the outcome of the war will be seen in the middle of this month. It is expected that the German air raids on Britain will reach their peak within two weeks. If Hitler fails to win the air war by October 1st, the British Air Force believes that his invasion may be delayed or even abandoned. (10th International Telegraph)</p>

<p>Dublin: German bombers again engaged in an all-night raid, with squadrons arriving in succession, bombing the center of London with 500-pound bombs. It is now feared that there will be many deaths and that many large buildings have been destroyed, including some of the largest in London, and some on Fleet Street, the street where newspaper offices are concentrated. One bomb hit an air-raid shelter, and it is feared that many people are buried inside. On several streets, rubble has accumulated to a height of twenty feet. The entire east end is almost covered with rubble, knee-deep. The harbor area was also heavily bombed. German aircraft started bombing at 8:38 PM last night and did not issue an all-clear signal until 5:40 AM this morning. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Between 11:54 AM and 12:18 PM today, London experienced its first air raid. Due to low cloud cover, the air battle could not be seen from the ground, but the sound of machine guns could be heard clearly. A bomb fell thirty yards from one of London's largest hotels, shattering the doors and windows of its dining room, but the building was undamaged. The passengers and staff, who took refuge in an air-raid shelter twenty feet below ground, were safe and sound and only heard faint explosions and did not feel any tremors. London issued a second alarm at 3:01 PM, which lasted only fifteen minutes, and the all-clear was given at 3:16 PM. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London: German long-range guns on the French coast, after two weeks of silence, suddenly roared yesterday, and shells flew to the Dover area. At the same time, London sounded its second air-raid alarm for the day. British heavy guns immediately retaliated, creating the largest cross-Channel artillery battle since the war began. British bombers also flew to enemy gun positions during the heavy shelling and attacked them. The severity of the tremors caused by the British bombs hitting the German gun positions shook the English Channel, twenty-five miles away, incessantly. However, the German guns continued to roar. After the new air raid over London stopped, the German shelling of Dover continued for an hour. (10th International Telegraph) London: German artillery positions on the French coast fired on the southeast coast of England today, luring away a large portion of the British Air Force that was previously defending London, making London's air defenses even weaker. During the 57th air raid on London by German aircraft this morning, which lasted nine hours, the German long-range guns also fired more and more fiercely. British artillery positions around Dover and other important strongholds on the British coast retaliated fiercely, temporarily silencing the German guns, but at dawn, shells flew from across the Channel to Britain again. Dover's artillery roared in response. The British Air Force and ground searchlights searched for German aircraft indicating targets for the artillery, non-stop from last night until this morning. (10th International Telegraph)</p>
<p>London: This morning, long-range guns on both sides of the Dover Strait continued to fire. German artillery positions opened fire first, and three shells shook the Dover area. The British responded by searching with searchlights for German aircraft spotting targets for the German artillery, and by firing long-range guns in retaliation. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London: A Ministry of Aviation communiqué stated that, according to reports received up to 9:00 PM last night, a total of forty-seven enemy aircraft were shot down on the 9th, including forty-five shot down by British fighter planes and two shot down by ground artillery. Thirteen British fighter planes were also lost, but the pilots of three of them were safe and sound. Last night, large numbers of enemy aircraft again approached the London area. The British retaliated fiercely. Although a small number of enemy aircraft sneaked to the north bank of the Thames, the damage there was minor. Bombs were scattered and fell south of London, mostly in the suburbs, and there did not appear to be any major damage. Detailed reports have not yet been received, but casualties are not expected to be heavy. A town in the Canterbury area was bombed yesterday, destroying several houses and killing several people. Dover was shelled last night, and British heavy guns retaliated. Several places in London were attacked last night. Many high-explosive and incendiary bombs fell in the western suburbs, and several fires broke out but were quickly extinguished by air-raid wardens and firefighters. Residents in west London saw a German aircraft emerge from the clouds and be pursued by a British fighter. It hastily dropped its bombs, then caught fire and crashed in the distance. Shortly afterwards, another German bomber was seen flying high over the Thames, and soon after, four explosions were heard. It is said that enemy aircraft also flew to the northeast and the Midlands. In a fierce air battle in the southeast yesterday afternoon, eight enemy aircraft were shot down. The air battle seemed to be directly over the Houses of Parliament. Londoners watching the battle saw a giant bomber, possibly a four-engine aircraft, hit by anti-aircraft fire and crash to the ground. One crew member parachuted to safety. It is widely believed that three enemy aircraft were also shot down in the air battle in southwest London. Two bombs hit a square in London, destroying part of a church. The church was built two hundred years ago. Several theaters in and around London have been ordered to close temporarily. London police are working hard due to the air raids, and no leave is allowed. Two bombs hit a museum in London, and the hall caught fire, and the roof collapsed. The fire was quickly extinguished, and it is reported that the museum did not suffer irreparable damage, and the valuables had been moved out several weeks ago. (10th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Yesterday, large groups of British Air Force bombers, braving the adverse weather over the continental coastline, fiercely bombed ships in German territory and German-occupied ports, as well as the ports of Hamburg, Bremen, Emden, Ostend, Calais, and Boulogne. According to the Ministry of Aviation, oil depots and ammunition depots were bombed, and many fires broke out, causing heavy damage. Eight British aircraft attacking did not return. British aircraft were particularly fierce in bombing German ships in various ports along the French and Belgian coast. The Germans have recently erected many anti-aircraft guns along the coast, indicating their desire to protect these assembled ships from being spotted and bombed by British aircraft. When British aircraft attacked last night, they flew to their destinations through intense gunfire. Ostend was repeatedly attacked from before 9:00 PM until 4:30 AM this morning. According to one pilot, British aircraft braved rain, snow, lightning, and thunder to fly to drop bombs, and saw explosions occurring inside and outside the Leopold Basin, followed by large fires. A barge in the dock was detected by another team of British aircraft, and they dropped large bombs, causing fires in many places. Another basin was attacked near 10:00 PM, and the basin was bombed again and set on fire within five hours. It is estimated that a fire in one of the Ostend docks spread over an area of 10,000 square yards. Ships moored at the pier were bombed and exploded violently. British aircraft at an altitude of 11,000 feet also felt the tremors. Shortly after 5:00 PM on the 8th, British aircraft flew to Boulogne to bomb ships with considerable success. Soon after, another group of British aircraft avoided barrage balloons and gunfire and flew over Boulogne. One aircraft dropped flares, illuminating the port as if it were daylight, and then dropped large bombs, hitting the outer harbor and the adjacent pier. Three bombs also hit the inner harbor. One British aircraft was initially unable to find its target due to the bad weather. At dawn yesterday, Calais was also bombed. The Ministry of Aviation also stated that British aircraft encountered German fighters several times. One Messerschmitt Bf 109 German aircraft pursued a British bomber that had already dropped its bombs. The British aircraft flew out to sea, and when the German aircraft approached, the rear gunner suddenly opened fire with two rows of shots, firing fiercely, and the German aircraft fled.

<p>London: Yesterday afternoon, German aircraft attacked London for the third time. German aircraft flew low to bomb several targets and dropped "Molotov breadbaskets" in densely populated areas of the city. This type of bomb, invented by the Soviet Union, consists of a basket containing countless small bombs. After being dropped, they scatter in the wind like hail.

<p>Bucharest: Romanian Prime Minister Ion Antonescu accepted the title of "National Leader" today. Antonescu forbade any military agency or other organization from using the name "King Carol II" in the future, and issued an order removing eleven generals from their positions, because they lacked talent and damaged the prestige of the Romanian army, and these eleven cannot escape responsibility for Romania losing territory, so they were dismissed.

<p>Bucharest: Romanian Iron Guard leader Professor Horia Sima met with German and Italian journalists yesterday and made a statement, saying that the participation of Iron Guard leaders in the new cabinet is the only way out for Romania. A few expert cabinet members are only assisting the Iron Guard cabinet members. Sima claimed that the Iron Guard and General Antonescu have consistent views, and he intends to begin discussing various political issues with Antonescu. The Iron Guard's political program focuses on material construction. The measures of the previous government were decided by foreign countries, while the Iron Guard movement will be based on the interests of all people of the country. Sima then announced the outline of the Iron Guard's policies: (1) In foreign affairs, absolute cooperation with the German-Italian axis; (2) In domestic affairs, destroying the power of the Jews and securing the freedom of all nationalities in the country. Sima continued to elaborate on his foreign policy, saying that he hopes that Romania and Germany and Italy will not only establish a political relationship of etiquette, but also build a relationship of joint struggle to realize common ideals. Sima mentioned the Iron Guard's attitude towards the royal family, stating that the group is loyal to King Michael. Regarding the attack on the special train of the deposed King Carol and the arrest of former Police Minister Marinescu, Sima claimed that he did not issue these orders. These actions were natural occurrences in the current tense situation in Romania. (10th Huitong dispatch)</p>

<p>Moscow - A correspondent for Pravda reports that, according to a report received by Krestinsky, the truth and background regarding the Romanian army's provocations on the Soviet-Romanian border in late August are now completely clear. According to a statement issued by the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on August 30th, the Soviet government had twice protested to the Romanian government. Prior to this, King Carol of Romania and his associates had been negotiating the cession of a large part of Outer Transylvania to Hungary and were also discussing guarantees from Germany and Italy regarding Romanian territory. However, in order to convince the Romanian people, the King had to seek excuses abroad to conceal these facts. Therefore, King Carol's faction decided to create a provocation on the Soviet-Romanian border. Those participating in the provocation included not only border troops but also regular army units and aircraft. King Carol knew that if Romanian troops attacked Soviet territory, the Soviet side would retaliate. He used this opportunity to spread baseless rumors that the Soviet Union was preparing to attack Romania and that Romanian military forces would inevitably fail. The only solution, he claimed, was to cede Outer Transylvania to Hungary and obtain territorial guarantees from Germany and Italy. It is clear that the King anticipated that these events would lead to conflict between the Soviet Union and Germany. The statement by the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on August 30th was published by various foreign newspapers, but it was not mentioned at all in the Romanian press. Clearly, King Carol's associates feared that publishing the document would expose the provocative actions of the Romanian leaders on the border. It is said that the current Romanian government is fully aware of King Carol and his associates' policy of provocation and has taken steps to expel the King and severely punish his associates. These factors are the real reasons for King Carol's abdication. (TASS dispatch from September 9th)</p>

The Pope's letter that Mr. Taylor brought to President Roosevelt, as the President said, shows that the Vatican is doing everything it can to seek world peace." The content of Early's statement did not seem to establish any basis for hopes that the joint efforts of the President and the Pope could produce any peace.

<p>(3) Forcing the investment of surplus funds in important national enterprises, such as coal-to-oil refining industry, synthetic rubber industry, and domestic unprofitable mining industries.</p>
<p>(4) Controlling all new factories and shops, making them devote themselves to national defense industries. Those unrelated to national defense industries are prohibited from being established or developed.</p>
<p>(5) All industries are under the complete control of the government. The delivery of goods, raw materials, and foreign exchange of factories are all controlled by the government.</p>
<p>(6) All capital markets, banks and insurance companies' financial resources, and company funds are borrowed by the government through various means.</p>
<p>(7) The salaries of company managers and directors are restricted.</p>
<p>Regarding labor: (1) Adjusting the wages that were reduced during the economic panic of 1932 to give workers a fixed wage.</p>
<p>(2) Controlling various occupations, conscripting workers to engage in various industries related to national defense, and prohibiting workers from switching to higher-paying jobs.</p>
<p>(3) Workers have no right to strike, and the establishment of all independent trade unions is prohibited. All workers must join the Labor Front, which is an organ of the National Socialist Party, and its organization includes employers and laborers.</p>
<p>Regarding consumers: (1) Under the slogan "Guns instead of butter," all food and daily necessities have long been subject to rationing. People's living standards have been reduced to a state of malnutrition.</p>
<p>(2) Using direct government distribution and propaganda to promote the consumption of abundant domestically produced food to conserve consumption.</p>
<p>Regarding farmers, fixed prices and controlled markets force farmers to hand over all their produce to special control agencies on a regular basis.</p>
<p>This German system looks very strict, but it is not without benefits. The unemployment problem has been solved. The industrial production index, which was 54 in 1932, had risen to 137 by June 1939. Agricultural production increased from 10,000,000,000 marks in 1932 to 14,000,000,000 marks in 1939. National income increased from 45,000,000,000 marks in 1932 to 100,000,000,000 marks in 1939. The number of employed workers increased from 12,500,000 in January 1932 to 22,000,000 before the outbreak of the war. The number of unemployed, which was more than 6,000,000 in January 1933, has now become so scarce that it is necessary to employ some workers from the conquered nations.</p>
<p>The treatment of German workers has been slightly improved in many ways compared to the past. For example, workers can receive regular pay during vacations. If they are dismissed or insulted, they can sue in the labor court. Workers also have more leisure time. On the other hand, if a factory lacks raw materials or workers, resulting in reduced working hours, the factory owner can obtain industrial assistance funds and partial redundancy payments.</p>
<p>Farmers can also obtain low-interest loans, cheap fertilizers, and other supplies. The prices of agricultural products are also higher than those in the world market. The only drawback is that the food shortage cannot be alleviated.</p>
<p>When Hitler came to power, he not only had to deal with a large number of unemployed workers but also had to fight against the Marxist proletariat. Hitler solved the unemployment problem and also partially realized the psychological transformation of the German people. However, Germany's birth rate, which was 971,000 in 1933, had increased to 1,420,000 last year. In terms of manpower, it can be said to be the first in Europe after the Soviet Union. Hitler still has two major obstacles to overcome: the lack of raw materials and the lack of gold and liquid capital to support his military expansion plans.</p>
<p>Germany's remedies for the shortage of raw materials are nothing more than three:</p>
<p>(1) All foreign trade, especially various imports, is under strict control. Every international trade transaction must be approved by the government. The import of non-essential goods is only permitted in exchange for German exports. This new plan was implemented in July 1934, stipulating that Germany's trade with other countries must be balanced in terms of imports and exports. Therefore, every country that wants to trade with Germany must also purchase goods from Germany, even if there is no need to purchase those goods.</p>
<p>(2) Strict allocation of raw materials according to the urgency of various productions for national needs.</p>
<p>(3) Massively utilizing its domestic raw materials to develop substitutes, such as extracting oil from coal, extracting rubber from coal and lime, and extracting textile fibers from wood. At the same time, regardless of cost, developing domestic mines of poor quality iron sand and other mineral deposits, and trying to save raw materials in all aspects. The main purpose of the "Four-Year Plan" lies in this, which is also the beginning of Germany's attempt to complete a self-sufficient policy as much as possible to avoid being trapped by blockades. The success of Germany's policy can be seen in its arms manufacturing. Germany's arms production exceeded twice that of 1913 at the start of this war.</p>
<p>According to the most favorable statistics for Germany, Germany can obtain two-thirds of the necessary raw materials from domestic resources. What is lacking are a few important basic metals, which must be imported from abroad at any high price.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the Four-Year Plan, the production of various factories has increased. However, the movement to increase agricultural production has not been very successful. Germany is not actually increasing production but reducing consumption, reaching a state of malnutrition. Germany's self-sufficiency in food was 75 percent in 1932 and had increased to 82 percent by the outbreak of the war, but there is still a shortage of more than 50 percent of domestic fats.</p>
<p>In terms of financial problems, the solutions used by Germany are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Declaring a suspension of the payment of interest on foreign debt in June 1933, which can save 1,200,000,000 marks per year. This measure can prevent domestic money from leaking to foreign countries, while money earned abroad through exports, shipping, and other businesses can be retained for purchasing foreign raw materials. In this way, Germany can not only purchase large amounts of devalued German stocks, which can be purchased for only a few cents per dollar, but also subsidize export goods. Furthermore, because German debtors pay foreign debts in non-circulating marks, the German government has a large amount of cash at its direct disposal. Creditor countries have also implemented currency devaluation to cope with this unfavorable situation.</p>
<p>(2) Germany also used its unique fundraising methods to issue securities and raise funds through various means. The loans of German provinces, cities, and agencies totaled 24,300,000,000 marks in 1933 and have now increased to more than 80,000,000,000 marks. According to some estimates, it is more than this number, and it is believed that German public debt has reached more than 100,000,000,000 marks, which is almost the same as the 160,000,000,000 marks accumulated during the four years of the last war.</p>
<p>However, the amount of banknotes in circulation in Germany has also tripled since 1933, with an additional 10,000,000,000 marks in banknotes and several trillion in public debt. Germany's domestic gold reserves are extremely scarce, amounting to only one percent. Therefore, although the German mark remains stable domestically due to the fixed price, it is practically worthless abroad.</p>
<p>(3) The economic prosperity created by the large-scale military expansion plan also allows the government to recover part of the money spent through a strict tax system. National tax revenue accounted for 25 percent of total income in 1932 and has now increased to about 47 percent. Various exorbitant taxes and levies totaled 14,131,000,000 marks in 1932 and have increased to 31,000,000,000 marks this year.</p>
<p>Germany's entire wartime machine, whether in the industrial or military field, has exhausted its resources. How long can this situation continue without collapsing is a question. But from the perspective of Germany's replenishment capabilities, Germany has placed the resources of the entire Europe under its control. If Britain blockades the entire European continent, waiting for Germany to starve to death or for a revolution to overthrow the National Socialist government, then German newspapers have already stated that it is not Germany that will suffer.</p>
<p>In short, the war has now become a confrontation between the two major forces of continental control and continental blockade. How the outcome will be is not yet possible to foresee. (End of this article)</p>
