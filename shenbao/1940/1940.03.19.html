<p>社評</p>
<h3>日本的政治攻勢</h3>
<p>軍事的攻勢失敗，跟着而來的，必然是政治的攻勢，這「團團轉」的方式。早已變為日本對華的一貫作風。現在阿部大將已內定為「駐華特使」而所謂「新中央政府」已在着手進行。不久以後，或許一九三二年在長春由當時駐偽滿特使簽訂議定書承認偽滿的怪劇，或將由阿部繼之搬演而再出現於今日。這一套把戲，無論其效果如何，日本既把這一節目作為它的最後救急的一張贏牌，到了武力征服中國既不可能，陰謀打擊抗戰政策又無半點效果可言時，就不能小把這一而再，再而三延期的舊節目，再行搬出來，作萬一的企圖。日本的幻想，是想通過這樣的新政權，建設其所謂「東亞新秩序」，調整中日關係，而達到其解決「中國事變」，完成其對華經濟侵略的最後月的。可是第一：今日全面抗戰的局勢決不同於以往局部的戰爭，日本以往行之於偽滿的一套戲法，可因傀儡的出現，可因中國一部分的軍隊暫被迫退它便，得到喘息的機會，而可從事進一步侵略的豫備。但自蘆溝橋全面戰爭發生後，這一局勢已完全改變，中國非把侵略軍隊逐去，決不停止抗戰，也決不讓它再有喘息的機會，而自陷於亡國的慘局，這一點上自最高將領，下至里巷庶民，都認識得很淸楚。日本也未嘗不想用武力來打得使中國屈膝，而把戰爭早日結束。但自湘北進攻的崩潰，以至南寗會戰的失敗，證明了日軍欲自西南山地擊潰華軍主力，達到訂立城下之盟，已不可能。賓陽的慘敗，日軍復被迫退至南髯城郊，南髯外圍的險要地帶於是皆由華軍克復，不但進攻的銳勢大减，並且鞏固南寗的防守綫也岌岌可危。南寗郊外現有華方的重軍在包圍着，而邕欽的後方也有華軍的機動部隊，時在襲擊，進則不免重蹈覆轍，退則後路華軍密佈，有被截擊的危險。現在日軍已在南寗改取守勢，而另向粵桂邊境的靈山縣取攻勢，這不是日軍的策略有了新的轉變，而正足以說明日軍為保守南寗，防護其後方的安全，不能不對於其側面威脅的華軍先加以「肅淸」，以謀其自身的安全。所以就桂南的局勢講，日軍已由進攻的銳勢，墮落至退守的頹勢。舉一反三，日軍既在華中無大規模的進展，又在晋省九度進犯中條山而華軍陣地屹然未動，都足說明中日兩軍已跨進了相持階段，相持愈久，則日本所受的損失必愈大，而促使其崩潰也必愈速。日本不能摧毀中國軍隊的主力，雖製造千百個手無寸鐵的偽組織，其所得的效果，根本就等於一個零。故目前全面抗戰中的特質，決不能和以往局部戰爭來相比擬，日本以往通過了一個偽組織，而就能暫獲喘息的機會，今欲獲之於它的未來偽組織已成夢想。第二：更有一點必須認識淸楚者，日本侵略東三省，可以收買張海鵬等實力供其驅使，達到以華制華的目的，而今日富有愛國思想的軍事將領及下級士兵，莫不奮不顧身，為國効死，從沒有受人利誘，而甘心失節投効的。日偽之所能利用者，不過那些沒落的舊軍閥及一二卑汚的失意軍人，而其所收編的軍隊，也是些土匪流氓，根本不夠供正規軍一擊，黃大偉所收買的偽軍，最近在潮汕一帶的失敗，就是其明證。這些土匪軍隊，是日方所培植的實力，而所得的下塲竟是如此，這是明白吾定了日本以華制華的目的。第三：日本成立所謂「新中央政府」，企圖除它自己承認外，同時也想用這新組織來威脅別國，斷絕對中國的接濟。日本海軍發言人在本月十四日曾發表談話謂，『如第三國一直對重慶政府予以同情及援助，新政權將排斥第三國的一切權利。』這是對美國最近以借款美金二千萬圓供給中國而發。可是美國在這新政權成立聲中，竟然以巨款借給中國，這又可證明中國抗戰的重要已為國際所認識，因為中國抗戰的勝利不但是民主勢力的勝利，也是世界良善秩序的勝利。美國羅斯福總統屢决指斥以侵略為手段的國家，決不會因日本此種作風而有所顧忌，那是很明顯的。總之，日本的玩弄手法，不過是自欺欺人，決不能改變世界的視聽，決不能有損中國的絲毫，這已成了鐵的一般的事實。</p>

<h3>德蘇對北歐　均謀擴展控制　各小國開始政治活動　巴爾幹各國進行團結</h3>
<p>瑞典京城　蘇芬媾和後、北歐諸國已開始空前未有之外交與政治活動、現有明白可見者、為下述兩點、（一）德蘇兩國均謀利用北歐諸國之惶慮、以擴展其對北歐之控制、（二）北歐對蘇芬解決之是非、爭論甚烈、恐北歐若干國家之內部政局將受影響、眾信德國亦望參加芬蘭對瑞典、與挪威建議之防守同盟、週杪德方官員兩人之抵此、當與政治現局有關、據消息靈通之觀察家意見、德國刻正加倍作宣傳努力以英法企圖便斯坎的那惟亞半島變作戰塲為言、並　誘令北歐諸國托庇於德國保護之下、以圖自救、聞斯坎的那維亞半島諸國、對德國此種運動之態度、可以「勿使吾人與友人分離」一語表示之、至於蘇聯擴張其勢力之努力、則更不為人樂聞、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>荷京　此間某報柏林訪員稱、德國似已開始擬在斯坎的那維亞半島商塲中排斥英國之運動、德政府以英國頃已與挪威瑞典締結商約為藉口、特向斯坎的那維亞半島諸國作緊急之交涉、說明具真正中立之需要、並聲明德國無論如何能從北歐半島諸國購取原料與食物、較英國　多、柏林人士雖指此　約為英國補償其對芬外交失敗之舉動、惟覺英國擬利用此　約、以取得斯堪的那維亞沿海之支配權、故已聲明如北歐諸國、允許英艦行使此權則為破壞中立之行為、其性質之嚴重、等於聽受英國唆使停止對德之貨物交換、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>瑞典京城　晚報載莫斯科消息稱、蘇聯政府除欲與芬蘭談判商約外、幷當與挪威、瑞典談判商務及貨物過境協定、俾蘇聯貨物得以通過兩國領土、運至各該國西部各港口、同時幷當要求各該國劃出自由港、以供蘇聯通商之用、（十七日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據此間特訊、前任柏林大學現任美國斯丹福大學教授之白朗特氏、近發表一文、內稱、如協約國以拖宕手段對付德國、則戰爭或須持久、惟德國終不免於失敗、德國在目前戰況繼續時、至少能抵抗封鎖至兩年之久、蘇聯因自己需要尚未能饜滿、故不能予德國以甚多之援助、而蘇德兩國之鐵路、亦未能在大規模上輸運油類、德國所　感棘手者殆為油之供給、徒以油不敷用、乃不能作長時期之大規模陸地戰爭後果如何、大都繫於今後戰事之性質、如協約國從事拖延以不速戰為策略、則戰事非一時所能結束、而德國卒必失敗、以意度之、英法在戰局中之第三年或第四年、當能以優勢軍力摧毀德軍也</p>
<p>紐約通報　分析各小國之地位、與迫其團結之壓力、謂此種演變、刻正在斯坎的那維亞半島進行中、但即在巴爾幹半島、以德蘇侵略為慮之各國、亦將逐漸改變其所固有彼此敵對之態度、而其盟約終將有反德與反蘇之趨勢、此乃吾人決不可忘懷者、蓋歐洲各小國獨立所將遭遇之危險、非來自協約國、但來自德蘇也、各小國所焦慮者在此、對德壓力屈服而起之危害、與對協約國壓力屈服而起之危害、兩者之程度與時期、大不相同、此種差異、雖巴爾幹極無知識之鄉農、亦深知之、此誠為了解巴爾幹半島現狀之關鍵也、（十八日路透社電）</p>

<h3>英美間　貿易難題</h3>
<p>海通社航空通訊、昇平之季、英國本部購置美國貨品之總值、超出輸往美國之英貨總值、每年在八千萬鎊之譜、若將自治領計算在內、則入超將再增一千五百萬鎊、但英國屬地與美國之貿易、則歲獲出超約三千五百萬鎊、是以就大英帝國貿易之通盤總賬觀察、由美國購入之貨、終較售給　國者為多、平時英國欲彌補上述之人超在財政上已感困難、因此於歐戰爆發前不久、擬訂英美商務協定、以為挽救之策、最近數年、英國輸入之美國貨、歲值一萬萬鎊、前次世界大戰時、最後之一兩年、英國因戰事之關係、英國輸入美國貨之總值、每年達三萬萬鎊、而今英鎊之價格減低、軍用品之價格飛漲、英國復有向美國購置軍用品之需要、則今後財政上所遭遇困難、豈不更大、況美國近又增訂付現自運之條款、英國得毋難上加難乎、英國政府固欲增加售給美國之商品數量、顧美國需購英國屬地出產之橡皮與錫等物雖有增加之可能、然充其量每年所增之貨值、終難超出一千五百萬鎊、豈能彌補漏巵、英國亦曾計及限制人口品之辦法、除軍用品有迫切之需要、難以限制外、英國已定購巨量之埃及棉花、佔其產額之大半、對於土耳其出產之煙草、英國復有購買相當數量之義務、由此可覘英國欲限制人口商品之數量、亦非毫無障礙、目前可預測者、英國似將停止購買美國出產之汽車、並將盡力購置自治領出產之食品、以代美國貨、但此種辦法之效果終屬有限、另有一策則為增加黃金之出口、大英帝國內每年出產之黃金、約值一萬萬鎊、近來已有大量黃金、輸入美國、為救濟英國對美貿易之入超計、自需再增加黃金之出口量、以資挹注、然所增數量、究竟能達幾何、仍無把握、總之通盤打算之後、英國對美國輸來之商品、如何籌款付償之問題、不惟尚未解決、目感異常棘手、英國政府當然不願大英帝國市塲中、以及南美市塲中、因此發生種種不利之反應、但戰爭如若延長、恐難免有此反應也、</p>

<p>預算較日大為減低</p>

<h3>工部局磋商　繼續平售麵粉　原定平賣期限明日為止　下期平賣價格尙未商妥</h3>
<p>本巿麵粉價格高漲後、上海工部局為抑平售價、救濟民食起見、前經商得阜豐·福新·兩麵粉廠之同　、自二月十九日起、至三月十九日止、共計三十天、每天供給平售麵粉七千五百包、由兩租界麵粉商店二十七家、平價出售、以資調節、此一個月中、計共平售麵扮二十二萬五千包、廠方損失至鉅、巳由該局總董樊克令君、專函以上兩廠、表示謝忱、惟聞繼續平賣一節、因近來原料洋麥價格高漲、工部局為廠方成本與抑平售價同時兼顧起見、已與以上兩廠積極磋商下期平售價格、進行以來、將近一週、尙未就緖、目前仍在繼續商洽中、一俟價格商妥後、再行宣布、俾得繼續調節、又切麵業公會、已通知各店、在三月十九日截止後、飭　常持續營業、如不得已購買回籠粉麵粉、因成本關係、得酌量提高、以應門售、</p>
<h3>工部局試行　節減監獄囚糧　以減發食米為入手　試騐期間定三個月</h3>
<p>公共租界工部局在增加市政捐反對聲中、昨日突發出公吿、略謂、本埠華德路監獄囚糧、在自後三月中、決定設法撙節、俾减輕工部局本年度之支出、按華德路監獄、範圍甚廣、共覊押八千五百餘人、（其中大半均係華人）彼輩所有支用經費、中國政府方面、向不負担、值此米珠薪桂之際、工部局鑒於華德路監獄經費日增、而增捐之事、又遭各方反對、故就一般的觀察、均認工部局此舉、乃屬應付各界反對加捐之第一步、</p>
<p>先行調查</p>
<p>工部局監獄囚糧經費、在本年度初步預算書內、原定每月七萬九千元、但實際上自本年一月份起、此項支出、每月增至十三萬五千元、即使糧食價格、以後不再吿漲、則本年全年囚糧支出、估計巳達一百六十萬元之譜、比初步預算、超出六十萬元、比上年約增一百十七萬元、該局有鑒於此、爰經砠織一特別委員會、會同各處代表曁衛生處專家、對於囚糧一層、進行調査、委員人選為麥唐納·許曉初·李文杰·及徐乃禮君等四人、</p>
<p>現行辦法</p>
<p>査過去對於减縮囚糧一端、曾有建議屢遭反對、其理由為囚糧一經减縮、當使犯人之患病與死亡率同時增加、現行之犯人膳食數量表、前經衛生處依據科學方法而編製、非常精密、同時對於膳食所含之滋養料、亦經予以注意、犯人之膳食、目前分為上·中·下三種、種類辦法、視犯人之是否在作工、是否在經醫生之診斷、及是否受罰而定、此外患有肺癆及他種疾病之犯人、並經給以特別膳食、委員會對於犯人之患病及死亡率亦曾加以注意、</p>
<p>酌減食米</p>
<p>據委員會聲明、其主要目的、在乎就囚糧所需與局方經費必須節省之兩方面、為納稅人利益着想、加以調整、以往各項囚糧之採購、均經公開招標、中標之標價、均選其最低數目、故認為囚糧方面、並無虛耗之處、至目下供給犯人之食米、為廉價之糙米、委員會對於囚糧之各種品料、均經遂項愼重審査、並考量是否可予酌减、結果向局方建議、囚糧中之食米一項、應作酌减之試騐試騐期間、定為一個月、上項建議、業經局方採納矣</p>

<p>下跌原因</p>
<p>不外貨多銷呆、市塲上賣多買少、並因銀根關係、大戶已將大量洋米脫售、加以目前堆棧、莫不滿坑滿谷、棧租遞增、同時各買戶鑒於米價下落、咸抱觀望態度、不願繼續吸納、於是供過於求、現貨允斥矣、並巿塲行號均須使用成票、故</p>

<h3>證券　公債一掃沉悶空氣　會德豐股造成新高價</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日巿况頗形騰　、一則以期貨買賣行將實現、又以外匯鬆軟、人心興奮、丙種驟衝出九元關、乙種亦穿出五十元大關多日來沉悶局面頓為之展開、市塲空氣緊張、又以丙種需要為多、籌碼忽告枯竭、前途已露曙光矣、昨日經過、上午趁勢尙形堅定、但以信孚天生昌記大康成及同順等不斷吸收、久豐號及聯和等先後賣出、而巿面仍屬求過於供、故上午即好起二三角行市、午後因賣、借貸不易、籌碼見枯、開做後在衆多買進中、丙種驟衝九元、乙種亦穿出五十元關、聯益聯和翻空為多、信孚昌記復行加碼、大豐順康同康等均有買進、久豐續有賣出、永豐大通天生均有出脫、但市氣甚盛、收盤後仍甚堅俏、綜計市價結果一致再漲六角半至八角半、成交約一百五十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交家庭工業社股三十股、價為五十二元正、</p>

<h3>糧食　粳米已有照限價開出　西貢跌進四十元關　原因到存擁擠銀根吃緊　又為棧租增加欲囤不是</h3>
<p>昨日米巿續在暴跌之中、較前史烈、各色洋米價繼瀉二元之巨、若一號西貢已有跌進四十元大關、售三十九元者、且市上久已絕跡之白粳、亦有依限四十元開出塘市宿粳一條、此猶似春雷乍發深堪震驚也、考此次米價一路直瀉、其原因實不脫夫到旺銷滯、滬棧儲存旣豐、而後大批洋米猶在不絕湧到、所需銀根繁重、謀其周轉靈便、祇有速脫一途、奈作客方面、初則尙有乘廉活動之心、及後日復一日、都是進則受虧、驚得悉懷戒心、縮手不出、於是造成愈跌愈呆、愈呆愈跌、逐日不息之跌風、一落千丈之際、昨雖早市一般客販曾擬堅持到底、卒以浮囤散戶、心懷恐懼、一跌再跌、迄午巿收盤、各色洋米續落二元左右、全巿成交較前尤稀、僅約三四千包而巳、回籠二號西貢及小絞原包均降至四十四元半、尙乏大戶問津、雖國外定價不需、然有大量存底與絡繹到貨、又被衛利韓公司將金利源棧租加至九角四分、藉以促客戶提貨、因此行囤莫不急於脫手、此亦洋米大跌之一因也、</p>
<p>糯米價盤素低、雖跌不若洋米之烈、計昨步下元砠耳、厚薄粳等國米、宿次者市上雖見塘市宿貨、業有依限開出一條、但高貨仍寂、尙在塲外私估暗盤、巳寥落異常、行情亦步步下趨元許云、</p>

<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開因美匯轉長、人心虛疲、銀樓帮與某金號均滿懷賣意、致開市遂撳小三十五元、銀樓帮售予現金號五十兩為五千三〇三十元、少頃賣風仍濃、續跌二十五元、銀號出金號三十兩為五千〇〇五元、此後某錢兌業乘低在拖、且美匯斯時轉定、而銀號亦買、雖某銀樓傾吐三百餘兩、但仍感不敷、反抬起四十五元、銀號進證券帮五十兩、為五千〇五十元、嗣因外匯重鬆、金號復來吐出、同時證券帮亦賣、再撳小三十五元、證券帮出錢兌業五十兩、為五千〇十五元、午刻錢兌業稍扒回升十元、證券帮進金號五十兩、為五千〇二十五元作午收價、午後初開略撳五元、金號互做五十兩、為五千〇二十元、俄而回起五元、錢兌業進金號三十兩、為五千〇二十五元、此後證券帮首來拋出、不久錢兌業銀號金號等傾向吐出、且斯時外匯報長、買者甚少、遂猛撳五十元、銀號出證券帮五十兩、為四千九百七十五元、入後某證券帮力代本帮搜買、而匯市亦報回軟、散戶浮空乘低補進、遂回升五十五元、銀號進錢兌業五十兩、為五千〇三十元作晚收價、結果比上週末軋跌三十五元、全天七十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金小而復大</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百十元、迨至下午二時半掛小五元、四時十分回起五元、結果平平、大同行依然懸五百十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>美金票　跌風大熾</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、以美金票趨勢最軟、各方供給奇盛、午後曾降至十五兀一角七分、蓋紐約巿塲之英鎊價格、果不出大衆所料、回長二分三七五、同時並有歐洲和平、又露曙光傳說故也、英美金鎊供塞亦湧、香港票隨港匯步軟、新加坡票及荷蘭羅比坎拿大斐律濱等潛勢仍弱、朝鮮票又復趨疲、晚市為九角八分五厘、僅日金票需要仍殷、市價續高至一先三角一分、昨日巿價、計英美金鎊各跌五角、美金票降一角八分、香港票低一分五厘、新加坡荷羅比坎斐律濱等票均跌五分、英金票供求平衡、巿價平穩、其餘各幣亦無變動、</p>
<h3>貼現續低一元　拆息升一分</h3>
<p>昨滙到票據貼現率略見下低、每千元上午由四十四元一度做低至四十二元、午刻稍回上至四十三元、下午仍站四十三元、比上週六最後價續低一元、錢業公會拆息、早午兩巿均掛一角八分、計升一分云、</p>
<h3>紗花　登記紗額不大　多頭復來加碼　站在一千元關內</h3>
<p>紗巿靜而穩、但美匯續見放長、海外印美棉巿轉趨下風、於是一般散戶人心看跌一步、無奈二十支雙馬、南方潮汕及香港需要繼續不懈、又有一說執貸者、向申新廠方登記之額僅三百餘包、多方認為存貨不厚、同時銷路不惡、所以對於雙馬紗看漲觀念愈進一步、就此而論、紗巿暫呈進退維谷之象也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、人氣仍緊、因汕頭帮突來收進現貨雙馬、市盤一鬨而升至九百七十四元、但匯兌放長、市價本有鬆動希望、被實銷支持一時、詎料美匯續長、檯面稍見虛弱、三月期雙馬由九百七十四元直跌至九百六十五元、一霎間多方復來拖進、又回漲至九百七十一元收盤、査半日間成交統計二千二百五十包、行情二十支雙馬現貨跌一元、出口棉紗、今有一百件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>棉銷沉寂　行情小一元許</h3>
<p>本棉交易轉趨沉寂、此因歐洲有和平消息、印美棉市均回下風、以致人心略疲、生意亦不及上日之旺、所以市態平當、行情稍短落一元光景、來源計有通花七百四十九包、茲將現棉成交情形左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉巿價、紐約棉市、晨初殊呈疲乏狀態、先因華爾街之賣出、及一部份多頭了結、故收盤市况、較之上日跌落十餘磅音、印度連同預測又跌八羅比、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊為靜寂、蓋因印棉已較美棉為廉、且近日印棉繼續步跌、淸明節又將屆臨、海外棉巿按照目前之情况、漲勢甚小、故各方現擬暫抱觀望、近數日交易恐難展開也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙六元三七五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布心思交易　移注期貨</h3>
<p>布巿實銷尙佳、惟巿上存底充盈、銀根週轉困難、故心思生意競趨遠期、呈近鬆遠緊之局、現貨售價平平、怡和十三磅粗布加五角、四月份各布開價較現貨每疋高二角半至五角、浙皖帮辦粗布·細布·漂染布一百餘件、閩粵辦漂布·花布·印花布百餘件、本街成交各項坯布及漂染印花布三百餘件、國外星加坡等地辦漂布·色布二千餘疋、十九日疋頭運香港五十八件、</p>
<p>東布白貨細布·細斜因外滙放長、業內外進意淡薄、市盤回挫、每疋跌一角半至二角半、惟中檔細布則以津帮及染廠頗有採納、成交五六百包、故陽鶴彩球等牌每疋僅降一角半、龍頭細布近疲遠堅、新棧單現出收盤時為一十七元九角半、而下月份尙需二十九元一角、四君子嗶嘰亦以下月份價最好、做開每碼八角八分、</p>
<h3>雜糧　堆棧加租　黃豆再跌</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆行巿、一再暴落、結果比上週六修削一二元不等、因大部份堆棧實行加租、二則銀根緊促、以致一般囤戶勢難株守、亟謀出籠、但辦胃裏足不前、行情步步下跌、下身貨已跌進二十元大關、統市祇由本街問津南京豆三車、價為二十一元至二十元零五角、蕪湖豆一千餘包、二十二元二角至十九元八角、揚州山黃豆一車、價為二十元、</p>
<p>十九日豆子運香港五百六十包、十八日自天津裝來生油二千聽、又自青島來一千一百三十四件、</p>
<h3>糖市　刁青漲五角</h3>
<p>昨太古車白、因某方曾以港幣一五·六〇開過數百包、比前升港幣〇·七〇、故公會劃盤B嘜西棧貨升三角、餘乏上落、H嘜車赤西棧四十五元半、升三角、東棧四十四元八角升一角、惟粗白續見下游、本掛六十二元、小二角、外棧新到六十一元八角、小七角、老貨六十一元半、小五角、荷赤現貨不動、轉口升半元、為三十九元半、本綿隨粗砂轉降、雪白六十一元半、一號冰七十四元、晶明冰七十五元半、均小五角、前日所開冰花靑初傳五十八元、昨證實為五十七元半、然已與普通白糖並駕、誠為靑糖中之最高價、國糖又開出新刁靑一百包、四十九元半、引五角、特高大宮粉叫六十二元、普通六十元、尙未成交、又荷蘭糖、昨日到滬二萬五千</p>
<h3>海味　螟蜅銷路轉稀</h3>
<p>螟蜅近以去化保滯、致巿勢漸入疲境、惟來源高檔仍少、但普通貨尙稱不乏、刻市正舟山蜅叫一百三四十元、外山　售七十元至六十八元、成交無多、</p>
<h3>海蜇頭皮升十元</h3>
<p>海蜇銷路漸展、近日頗有交易、査底積日薄、而來源亦少、故刻市較之舊臘已好起十元、如蜇皮為五十五元、蜇頭四十五元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　橘餅開升二元</h3>
<p>厦橘餅日前所到之貨、昨巳有開出、貨品色澤尙佳、惟坯子較硬、以需要正活、故開價又升二元、如有高檔到來、尙看再緊、</p>

<p>九十磅及一百磅之十四吋二十吋小馬口鐵、巿面一度告靜、唯前昨以來、各路銷塲又見蓬勃、聞昨日全市成交竟達白餘箱、市象扶搖直上、如九十磅每箱喊一百元、一百磅沽一百十元內、均係一百十二張裝、</p>

<p>心理</p>
<h3>欺嚇的敎育</h3>
<p>— 炎泉</p>
<p>一個常態的人，必定要具有常態的心理。要造就常態的心理，則必始自兒童。近代因敎育之不斷的演進，學校敎育都漸有注重兒童心理的趨勢。歐美各國許多前進的敎育家，現在也都已改　其注意點於兒童敎育，特別對於首六歲兒童的敎育，正在積極提倡。因為兒童在首六歲，是生長最快的一個時期，而人物的一切習慣，心理，行動，也無不在此一時期養成。依照心理學家實騐的結果，證明習慣既已養成，則改變自較不易。尤其到了成人時期，習慣的改變便格外困難。所以幼稚兒童的敎育，便格外値得重視了。</p>
<p>中國的幼稚敎育，現今尙在萌芽時期，幼稚兒童的保育，大都繫在一般母親身上。而中國的母親，訓導兒童的傳統方式，不外是欺騙或恐嚇。舉例來說：母親看見小孩子吃賸飯碗，便附會迷信去欺騙說。。</p>
<p>「雷公要打雷了。以前有人像你這樣，所以給天打死了。」如果晚上孩子哭鬧時，便說是「鬼怪來了，野貓來了。」這樣使兒童便染上一層迷信神鬼和恐懼黑暗動物或仇恨動物的心理。有的母親更要不得，她們在黑暗裏恐嚇兒童的吵鬧，時常說「紅頭阿三來了，外國人來了，或者竟是某國人來了」。這樣，在兒童徲弱的心靈上，便蒙上一種族自卑的暗影，或者會加深一種種族的仇恨。我以前有一位鄰居主母很愛她的兒子，在兒子跌了以後，時常移怒女僕，有時踢傷了桌椅自動的跌了，也總是去打擊桌椅為兒童出氣，雖然可以暫時移去兒童的注意或是會破滋而笑，但在無形中却給兒童養成了不如　時擊桌丟碗踢門打壁的習慣，反而使母親受累不淺。又如一個兒童如果受了過度的恐嚇，則不但能使他的觀念不正確，而到了晚上還要形諸夢境，甚至會心理失常。反之，一個兒童如果受到家庭溺愛，那也是無形中受了欺騙。他脫離了母親，便會感覺不能適應環境的痛苦，尤其對團體生活要生出種種惡感。上海一般的主母們叫傭僕帶領小孩，通常都說是「騙小孩」。好像成人對於幼兒，不必具有　實的心理，只要兒童能不哭不叫，那便是上好的保姆了。</p>
<p>欺騙，恐嚇，使兒童得到許多不正確的知識，也使兒童獲得了許多不正確觀念和心理。我們不要駡兒童脾氣壞，也不要恨兒童長得獃，每個做父母的人，都應該反躬自省，到底你給了他們羣小生命多少欺騙和嚇的敎育？</p>
<p>我們看在這個時代中，許多飽經滄桑的成人尙且會受小住威脅利誘的打擊而心理因之失常，那末，兒童那種穉弱的心靈，是格外不應該用「欺」一嚇」的方法去實行你的敎育的了。</p>
<p>我們抗議一般成人對兒童實施欺嚇！</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3>字數</h3>
<p>— 競爭</p>
<p>寫文章而計較到字數，除去為了應付某種考試或某種規定時「需若干字以上」或「限若干字以下』等情形而外，大概是一班寫稿的人。</p>
<p>自從報章雜誌徵稿，訂出了「每千字若干元」的稿酬條例以後，於是許多人便實行其『拉扯工夫』，明明的這點意見三百字可完，非拉到五白字八百字不可，蓋不如此不能得較多稿費也。因此，在各處常可見到內容簡單而篇幅奇長的，　是洋洋數千字而空若無物的文章。</p>
<p>我曾聽到一位「作家」的宏論；寫散文不若寫小說。』當下，我便虛心地『願聞其旨。』他便舉出寫小說的第一『好處』來，便是小說易拉字數，散文倒要有點『因思筆理順』（Inspiration）的作用，不容易寫得長。</p>
<p>寫文章而注意長短，為了一點稿費，不惜硬拉硬扯，弄得一篇很好的緊湊簡練文字，拉得「神龍見首不見尾」，一班「近視」讀者便贊曰：「好文章，看，寫得這們長！」如此，欲得眞正佳文，亦難矣！</p>
<p>我願以「有話便長，無話便短」八字獻給現今寫寫稿子的文人們！</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>希特勒的英國女友</h3>
<p>— 陳師超</p>
<p>本年一月間，報紙上曾刊載件消息，說希特勒的英國女友密德福女士，身受槍傷，歸家時是用担架界回的。這位被希氏認為理想的北歐女性，是英國貴族的女兒，自一九三八年以來，她的芳名，就時常出現於各報的大標題中了。</p>
<p>自一九三九年九月起到十二月止，她的活動，極為神秘。　時她是在德國。到了今年一月間，報紙才報吿她受槍傷用担架檯回倫敦的消息。</p>
<p>這位貴族女郞，現年二十五歲，身長玉立，金髮貌美。當去年九月三日英國對德國宣戰之時，因為交通斷絕，她被困在德國不得出境。到了十月二十日，就傳出一個消息，說她臥病於慕尼黑某醫院內。並有施行外科手術的必要。但是關於她所患何病，却沒有詳細報吿。</p>
<p>密德福女士之成為政潮的中心，已經兩年了。但是她初决邂逅希特勒，却遠在這塲波瀾之前。據說，在一九三四年的某天晚上，希氏到慕尼黑的某餐館用膳，他看見密德福女士坐在附近的一隻檯子。</p>
<p>希特勒就問他的一位副官說：「這位完美的北歐女性是誰？」那副官答稱她是英國人。希氏立刻命令邀其同席，從那時起，密德福女士就成為希氏的崇拜者。反之，她也變為希氏所賞識的少數女友之一。</p>
<p>她的擁護希特勒和純粹主義，遭遇了許多反響。一九三八年六月間，她在卡爾士巴城，以間諜嫌疑被捷克當局所捕。在這件事發生前不久，她曾宣佈要入德籍，這大概是她到捷克去不受歡迎的原故。但是，她却祇被扣留一天，便開釋了。</p>
<p>另一次，是在一九三八年四月間，也是因左袒納粹主義而吃苦頭。當時在倫敦海德公園，曾開個擁護西班牙共和政府的民眾大會，密女士臂上掛着一只卍字徽章，被示威的羣衆所毆傷。後來被警察所救出才脫險。</p>
<p>密女士，生於一九一四年。她的父親是第二雷列施戴男爵，共生女公子六人。她行居第四，芳名優妮蒂。她的一位姊姊，是英國法西斯黨魁莫士萊爵士的妻子。</p>

<h3>不怕批評</h3>
<p>— 史葉</p>
<p>無論那一個人，都免不了給人批評。</p>
<p>但有些人生來就是一副「薄皮相」，害怕人家的批評。指摘，訓斥的時候，就弄得面紅耳赤，手足無措；偶爾聽到背後揚醜，攻擊的說話，就弄得寢食不安，以為無顏見人，甚至生起厭世的念頭。</p>
<p>其實對於人家的批評，是不用害怕的。批評有善意惡意之分，善意的我們就應虛心地接受，惡意的就不用顧慮。據我平日的經騐看來，在人背後的批評，都不是善意的，甚至是造謠·中傷·誣蔑·這種人的人格的卑鄙可想而知。在人背後的批評，俗語叫做「說壞話一，所以最會說人壞話的人，一定是「壞人」。對於壞人」的批評，還用害怕什？</p>
<p>對於人家的批評，我們應該取種正確的態度。不論是規勸也好，指摘也好，攻擊也好，造謠也好，誣蔑也好，我們都一概收羅來，客觀地加以考察，再審愼地進行一自我批評」，澈底地檢討自己一切的言行有否錯誤和過失，「有」便應直認不諱，努力想法改正，克服；「無」便不用顧慮，處之泰　。假如對方的批評是惡意的話，那便給以嚴正的答覆。能够這樣，我們非但不用害怕人家的批評，相反的，我們要迎歡人家的批評了。</p>
<h3>兒童集團結婚</h3>
<p>— 海風</p>
<p>最近印度孟買管區之北部，卡提阿瓦鄉村中，舉行集團結婚。參加的嬰兒共三七四對，為近幾年來規模最大之兒童結婚典禮。有許多新人實在太小了，還不會跑路，由他們的父母抱了來，一切都由父母們去擺佈。嬰兒們却很舒適地躺在懷中，聽見禮砲嚮時，只是咯咯作笑聲。新郞來了，有許多是　着裝飾得很考突的牛車來的，送到了僧侶們的面前，有的在笑，有的在哭。大多數都小知道是什麼一回事。行禮時，由僧侶們誦讀誓詞，禮成後聯合餐宴，父母們也一同參加。新人們吃得很少，有的到處訂轉，有的搶食，有的在玩，頂小的又睡着了。　虔因為階級制度及賣　婚姻的關係，童婚一直到現在還是　行着，近年來，政府當局雖曾設法禁止，亦無大效。一九三五年頒佈法令規定最低結婚年齡為十四歲；一九　四年亦有類似的法律，規定最低年齡為十三歲，這種法律都難發生効力，因為印度所有階級，向來都是准許童婚的。據一九二一年的調査，印度共有二十五萬的凄于及寡婦是年齡在五歲以下的，有二百萬是在十歲以下的，據估計，印度女子中，在十歲與十五歲之間　婚的約佔白分之四〇。</p>

<h3>關於國片的建議</h3>
<p>— 包復興</p>
<p>近　　年以來，上海也許是因為環境關係，大部份的國片，都跑到「古裝片」這一條以前根本未想到的路途上去了，尤其是近一二年來，簡直是（古裝片」獨覇世界！在古裝片方面，又幾乎全部都是在「女人」身上轉念頭，這當然是極不應該的。</p>
<p>而且，現今及已往的古裝片，縱然攝製認眞，終也銷除不掉牠本身的缺點，因爲我們日常接觸着的都是現代的物質，現代的精神，一旦跑進電影院，就滿眼「古色古香」，這豈是「妥善之道」？</p>
<p>所以從今之後，無論如何，都不能讓古裝片獨覇下去，照我個人的意見，古裝片的攝製，應退爲輔助地位，主要的目標，應該是具有現代精神及現代意義的「現代片」——或稱具有時代精神及時代意義的「時代片」，——環境的困難，人人都知道，可是「事在人爲」最要緊的是。，肯幹！何况在服裝道具佈景劇本種種方面又都較古裝片容易得多呢！即如「現代片」中，國華的（七重天」就很能令人滿意。</p>
<p>在這物價暴漲的時候，（現代片」的材料，更是多得「俯拾皆是」；米蛀蟲，煤蛀蟲，冰死鬼，餓死鬼，盜賊的猖獗，自殺的增多，甚至敎育界一部份的「老板」等，也應當加以攻擊和糾正！這一切的一切，都是極佳的劇材！而且電影藝術的範圍又是異常廣大的，文藝片，科學片，社會片都是能够攝製而又賣座佳，有意義的，何樂而不「拍」呢？</p>
<p>所以，我希望各國片公司當局，對於攝製方針，能斟酌實際的情勢，加以改良，並以更大的努力，使國片更受國人的歡迎！</p>
<h3>飛機中放映無綫電影</h3>
<p>— 清暉</p>
<p>美國派拉蒙公司最近在茀洛立達地方上空，用航郵飛機開映無綫電影，試騐結果，認爲圓滿。此决試驗所用之機器，爲羅偉牌之標準放映機，一切機件悉係經過藥水洗練而無燃燒性，以防不測。銀幕寬度只六英吋，懸於機師室後，所佔地位極爲狹小。據美國報紙記載，影片中之動作對白，與平時放映者一般無二，惟飛機上升，速度突加之際，則幕上人影，略為歪曲。而對白亦爲軋之機聲所擾，然頃刻即能復原，故亦無太妨碍。空中飛行，本最寂寞，今後即可利用無綫電影，以供娛樂。因此次試騐之成功，衆信不决將來，凡長距離之載客飛機中，均將開映無綫電影，以解除旅客之寂寞也。</p>
<h3>壺齋曲話　反二簧與反西陂</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>平劇腔調，名目頗多，各有其性質意義及作用，今談反二簧與反西陂，反者變也，此二者皆變調也，兵家有正必有奇，樂歌有正必有變，蓋自然之勢也。二簧發源於長江流域，其聲緩以和，與崑曲之南曲相同，及變爲反二簧，則用以表現哀情，巫猿啼峽是矣。</p>
<p>老生戲，如碰碑，烏盆記，法塲換子，牧羊圈，柴桑口，靑衣戲，如祭塔，祭江，落花園，宇宙然，賣糕敦；小生戲如求義節，小顯，皆借反二簧之腔調，以吐出無限悲哀者也。至西陂本秦腔支流，產於山野，其聲高亢而激烈，及變寫反西陂，專爲唱出哀情之用，杜鵑泣血，恰足當之。反西陂無慢板，祇有二流，（即俗呼二六，）及散板二種，老生有之，連營寨劉備哭靈，唱反西陂二流，魚腸劍伍子胥吳市吹簫，唱反西陂散板，探母之別妻哭堂，亦唱反散板，惟反西陂不論二流板或散板，唱至末尾時，必須再復回西陂正調，因反西陂其實乃犯一簧腔，一往不復，則直成二簧矣。（上）</p>

<h3>國華花絮</h3>

<p>合古今滑稽之雄於一處，時裝古裝。同時演　，可說是國華的獨創。一李阿毛與東方朔一就是這一個空前的嘗試，昨天拍李阿毛與東方朔在南天鬥外相遇，一個說：「來者莫非是東方朔老前輩」？一個說：「來者莫非是李阿毛博士」？開口就令人發噱。這一段里，有許多新噱頭，都是想入非非的。他們在雲端里玩把戲，誰也不會看出是佈景的作用，足見美工科的技藝高明</p>
<p>工匠忙了三天，祗拍了一塲的戲，這是「蘇三艷史」裏，狀元游街。舒適飾王金龍，高中了一甲一名的狀元，奉旨游街，鼓樂喧天，盛極一時，飾觀衆及兩旁店夥的臨時演員有二百八十五人之多，襯托着堂皇富麗的排塲，眞是牡丹綠葉，相得益彰。</p>

<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Hopes Allied Nations Will Forgo Petty Grievances</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to an editorial in today's Shishi Xinbao, Japan is making a big fuss over the Soviet-Japanese military conflict on Sakhalin Island, clearly showing its overtures to Britain and France. Its purpose is nothing more than to establish a new relationship with Britain and France and then continue to plot against China. Although we firmly believe that Britain and France will not fall for the Japanese trick, we cannot but take precautions. Speaking of the Soviet Union, the newspaper said that Germany and Italy have already strengthened their friendship with the Soviet Union. Why can't Britain and France restore friendship with the Soviet Union? The matter is incomprehensible. We hope that all friendly countries will forgo petty grievances and not allow Japan to monopolize China's actions. This is the best policy. It is also reported that after the signing of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, Japan has transferred troops from various battle lines to the border of "Manchukuo".

<h3>Central Government Sends Personnel to Shanxi for Disaster Relief</h3>

<h3>National Socialist Party States Its Position</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The National Socialist Party cadres in Chongqing issued a declaration stating the party's solemn stance. Zhang Jun delivered the declaration to the Central News Agency, which stated: Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War on August 13, our party members believe that this is a critical moment for the survival of the nation, and it is unjustifiable to engage in internal strife and consume the country's strength. Therefore, following the precedent of national unity in wartime in general, we support the government's policy of resistance against Japan. However, in December 1938, Wang Jingwei suddenly fled the country and extended his hand to the Japanese for peace talks. Our party members believe that the source of this war lies in the Japanese occupation of Northeast China on September 18, and the subsequent endless invasion. If Japan truly wants peace, it should withdraw its troops and retreat from the occupied areas, and everything can be easily resolved, and peace can be achieved easily. If there is a faction within us advocating for peace, it will not only cause division of opinions and dispersal of strength, but there is also no hope for a victorious peace agreement. Moreover, a country negotiating peace with others must hold military power itself, so that it can make peace if it is suitable or continue fighting if it is not. Now, if a person is unarmed, the power of life and death is in the hands of others. This kind of peace negotiation method is unprecedented in world history. In the past, the Rhine region of Germany, incited by the French, attempted to secede from the German government, but the result was ultimately extinction. Therefore, the fate of the puppet government in Nanjing can be predicted. It is heard that there are people in Shanghai who have issued a declaration in the name of the "National Socialist Party Political Affairs Special Committee" to support it, which is clearly an act of stealing the name. Since its establishment, our party has always remembered the great righteousness of the nation above all else, only hoping to establish an independent government with the country's own strength. We are unwilling to participate in any other out-of-bounds actions. This is a special declaration. (18th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangxi Actively Promotes War Zone Education</h3>

<h3>Gansu Limits the Total Number of Opium Smokers in the Province to Eradicate Opium Addiction</h3>
<p>Lanzhou: The Gansu Provincial Government has listed opium prohibition as the most important policy this year, immediately ordering all opium smokers in the province to completely quit by the end of June. Chairman Zhu recently issued a special order to all commissioners and county magistrates to mobilize people from all walks of life and baojia personnel to carry out widespread publicity. All counties with opium rehabilitation centers should immediately implement mass rehabilitation. Those without opium rehabilitation centers should order opium smokers to quit on their own.

<h3>Japan's Political Offensive</h3>
<p>The military offensive fails, and what follows is inevitably a political offensive. This "spinning around" tactic has long been Japan's consistent approach to China. Now, General Abe has been internally designated as the "Special Envoy to China," and the so-called "New Central Government" is already underway. Before long, perhaps the strange drama of 1932 in Changchun, where the then Special Envoy to the puppet Manchuria signed a protocol recognizing the puppet Manchuria, will be re-enacted by Abe and reappear today. Regardless of its effectiveness, Japan is using this program as its last-ditch effort. When it is impossible to conquer China by force and there is no effect in undermining the policy of resistance, it has no choice but to bring out this old program, which has been postponed again and again, to make a last-ditch attempt. Japan's fantasy is to build its so-called "New Order in East Asia" through such a new regime, adjust Sino-Japanese relations, and achieve its final goal of resolving the "China Incident" and completing its economic aggression against China. But first: Today's situation of full-scale resistance is definitely different from the previous local wars. Japan's previous tricks in the puppet Manchuria could take advantage of the appearance of a puppet regime, the temporary forced retreat of a part of the Chinese army, and the opportunity to catch its breath and prepare for further aggression. However, since the outbreak of the full-scale war at the Marco Polo Bridge, this situation has completely changed. China will not stop resisting Japan until the invading army is driven out, and it will never allow it to catch its breath again and fall into the tragedy of national subjugation. From the highest generals to the common people in the streets, this point is very clear. Japan has never stopped wanting to use force to make China yield and end the war as soon as possible. But the collapse of the Xiangbei offensive and the failure of the Nanning Campaign proved that it is impossible for the Japanese army to defeat the main force of the Chinese army in the mountainous southwest and reach a treaty of surrender. The disastrous defeat at Binyang forced the Japanese army to retreat to the suburbs of Nanning again, and the strategic areas around Nanning were recaptured by the Chinese army. Not only was the momentum of the offensive greatly reduced, but also the defense line of Nanning was in danger. Heavy Chinese forces are currently surrounding the suburbs of Nanning, and there are also mobile units of the Chinese army in the rear of Yongqin, constantly attacking. Advancing would inevitably repeat the previous mistakes, and retreating would lead to the danger of being intercepted by the Chinese army, which is densely deployed in the rear. The Japanese army has now taken a defensive posture in Nanning and is taking an offensive posture towards Lingshan County on the border between Guangdong and Guangxi. This is not a new change in the Japanese army's strategy, but it is enough to say that in order to protect Nanning and the security of its rear, the Japanese army has no choice but to "eliminate" the Chinese army threatening its flank first in order to seek its own safety. Therefore, judging from the situation in Guinan, the Japanese army has fallen from the sharp momentum of the offensive to the declining trend of retreat. By analogy, since the Japanese army has not made large-scale progress in Central China, and the Chinese army's position has remained unshaken after the Japanese army has repeatedly invaded Zhongtiao Mountain in Shanxi, it is sufficient to show that the two armies of China and Japan have entered a stage of stalemate. The longer the stalemate lasts, the greater the losses suffered by Japan will be, and the faster it will collapse. Japan cannot destroy the main force of the Chinese army, and even if it creates hundreds and thousands of unarmed puppet organizations, the effect it gets is fundamentally equal to zero. Therefore, the characteristics of the current full-scale war cannot be compared with the previous local wars. In the past, Japan could temporarily gain a breather through a puppet organization, but now it has become a dream to gain it from its future puppet organization. Second: One more point that must be clearly understood is that Japan could buy over Zhang Hai Peng and other powerful figures to drive them to achieve the goal of controlling the Chinese with Chinese in the invasion of the three northeastern provinces. However, today, military generals and lower-level soldiers with patriotic ideas are all risking their lives and sacrificing themselves for the country, and no one has been tempted by bribes and willingly lost their integrity and surrendered. What the Japanese puppets can use is only those fallen old warlords and one or two base and frustrated military men. The army they recruit is also a group of bandits and rogues, which is not enough to withstand a single blow from the regular army. The recent failure of the puppet army bought over by Huang Dawei in the Chao-Shan area is proof of this. These bandit armies are the strength cultivated by the Japanese side, and the outcome they have obtained is like this, which clearly proves Japan's intention to control the Chinese with Chinese. Third: Japan has established a so-called "New Central Government" and attempted to use this new organization to threaten other countries and cut off aid to China, in addition to its own recognition. A Japanese naval spokesperson stated on the 14th of this month that "if a third country continues to sympathize with and provide aid to the Chongqing government, the new regime will exclude all rights of the third country." This was in response to the recent loan of US$20 million to China by the United States. However, the United States has loaned a large sum of money to China despite the establishment of this new regime, which proves that the importance of China's resistance has been recognized by the international community, because the victory of China's resistance is not only the victory of democratic forces, but also the victory of the world's good order. President Roosevelt of the United States has repeatedly condemned countries that use aggression as a means, and it is obvious that he will not be deterred by Japan's actions. In short, Japan's tricks are nothing more than deceiving itself and others. It cannot change the world's views and cannot harm China in the slightest. This has become an ironclad fact.</p>

The exact content of the two and a half hour discussion is unknown, but according to official hints, the main topic was the recent international developments in Europe.

<p>Rome: Political figures here claim that Mussolini will return to Rome early tomorrow morning and will meet with US Undersecretary of State Welles before noon. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to sources here, today's meeting between Mussolini and Hitler was the fifth such talk between the two dictators. Preparations for this meeting were swift and absolutely discreet, which is always sufficient to demonstrate the harmony between the Fascist Party and the National Socialist Party. Each of the two leaders was accompanied by a small group of strategists, who always accompany them on their travels. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Officials here stated at 11 PM last night that the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini had been planned for some time. Ribbentrop's recent trip to Rome was to discuss the procedures for the meeting. Hitler and Mussolini were scheduled to meet at the Brenner Pass on the morning of the 18th. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

(Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris: Although the news of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini came as a surprise, commentators here believe that this plan had been in the works between Berlin and Rome for some time. Pertinax declared in L'Ordre yesterday that a peace offensive was imminent. Mussolini and Hitler, behind the scenes, believe that they can use Welles as an intermediary to get President Roosevelt involved and feel smug. The Journal de Paris stated that Mussolini and Hitler will work according to a carefully prepared plan, possibly manipulated by the diplomatic intrigues conducted by the German government in Southeastern Europe in recent days. L'Ere Nouvelle also stated that rumors that Hitler intends to have closer cooperation between Germany and Italy to prevent the reddening of the Balkans, in order to win the favor of President Roosevelt and the Pope to come forward and mediate, are not entirely without basis. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>London: Well-informed sources here recently stated that when Italian Premier Mussolini holds talks with German Führer Hitler today, he will try his best to persuade him to make significant changes to the current situation in Czechoslovakia and Poland, bringing it closer to the views of Britain and France. However, the general public does not rate the results of this talk too highly, saying that in the view of Britain and France, even if Germany makes significant concessions on the issues of Czechoslovakia and Poland, it cannot be regarded as meeting the preconditions for peace talks. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Paris: Political figures here were not very surprised to hear that Italian Premier Mussolini is scheduled to meet with German Führer Hitler tomorrow, and said that according to diplomatic sources, the leaders of Germany and Italy had long decided to meet somewhere in early spring this year. This matter was reportedly initiated by Germany, with the goal of ascertaining to what extent Italy can take action to supplement Germany's actions. It is difficult to say whether this meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy will launch a new "peace offensive," but one thing is certain: Germany's actions, and the meeting between the leaders of Germany and Italy, show that their ambition to control Europe has not diminished in the slightest. As for Premier Mussolini, he firmly believes that Britain and France are determined to fight to the end and will only make peace after all their objectives have been achieved. For this reason, Italy will not initiate anything without the consent of the United States, hoping to end the current war. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Volkszeitung stated that "Mussolini and Hitler may only discuss the Balkan Peninsula issue, but they will certainly issue peace proposals to shake the nerves of Britain and France and confuse American public opinion. This is what the dictators are good at, but the democratic countries are now fighting based on the basic principles of conscience and strength, that is, freedom of speech and freedom of will. This is what the United States should be aware of." (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome: Observers here recently stated that the meeting between Premier Mussolini and German Führer Hitler at the border between Germany and Italy was agreed upon in a long-distance phone call yesterday. Because after exchanging views with US Undersecretary of State Welles, Mussolini believed that the timing was very opportune to mediate between Germany and Britain and France, so he arranged to meet Hitler in order to discuss peace issues. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Although German officials have taken a cautious and silent stance on the talks between Hitler and Mussolini, the Börsen-Zeitung declared that the people of the world are focused on the meeting between the German Führer and the Italian Premier, knowing that their words and decisions are in agreement with each other and are not only related to Germany and Italy, but also have an impact on all of Europe. The impact of this meeting will inevitably be seen in reality sooner or later. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Washington: Political circles are now focused on the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, but so far there is no indication that US Undersecretary of State Welles is involved. People in the State Department do not want to criticize this, but well-informed people in political circles believe that this meeting is more due to Germany's efforts to create a peace movement and less due to Italy's efforts to join its allies in the war. It is generally believed that this meeting may allow Mussolini to tell Hitler the last words he gave to Welles, and according to recent news from Italy, none of them indicate that this talk between the two leaders is a preparation for any overt resistance to Britain and France.

<p>New York: The New York Times stated that "President Roosevelt's speech has explained the views of most Americans on the conditions for a 'genuine peace.' In essence, a genuine peace should be based on a moral foundation.

<h3>Fourteen German Planes Attack Scottish Coast, Attempt to Bomb Forth Bridge Fails, Over One Hundred Bombs Dropped in Scapa Flow</h3>
<p>London: It is reported that on Sunday night, German planes attempted to bomb naval and military targets throughout the Scottish coast. German bombers planned to fly to the Forth Bridge, but were repelled by British fighter planes before they could get close. When German planes raided Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands, one civilian was killed. This is the first civilian to die in Orkney from an air raid. The person lived near the Stronsay civilian airfield and was killed by a high-explosive bomb when looking out the door at the bullets flying and anti-aircraft shells exploding. The bomb was one of nineteen bombs dropped by a fleeing German plane. The person left behind a wife and a child. Two male neighbors standing at the door were also injured by the bomb. The thatched roof of an old woman's cottage was destroyed, and the old woman crawled out of the rubble and collapsed on the way. Another woman and an old man were also injured. Few people sought shelter during the raid, preferring to witness the largest air raid that Orkney and Scapa Flow had ever experienced. German planes dropped over fifty high-explosive bombs and dozens of smaller incendiary bombs in West Orkney. Windows in the area were shattered, and the fragments flew to a height of 20 to 40 feet. Residents then ran into air-raid shelters to avoid them. German planes then flew over Kirkwall at a low altitude of 2,000 feet. At that time, the entire area was illuminated by a terrifying flash of gunfire, and explosions occurred every few minutes. Last night, the British naval community stated that only small encounters occurred over Scapa Flow. The German commander is eager to exaggerate this and falsely claim to have damaged British warships, which is enough to show his nervous instability and childish psychology of exaggerating victory. It is widely recognized that the eastern and northern bases of Britain are vulnerable to air raids, but we are confident that we will perform well in the course of the war. Only a small number of the planes sent out by the enemy to attack flew here to bomb, and the rest must have gotten lost. This is of great significance, and the German planes that arrived in Britain also did not dare to confront the gunfire of warships and artillery, and were only satisfied with harming civilians in small villages five or six miles from the port. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>London: According to reliable sources, fourteen German planes flew to Scapa Flow in northern Scotland at 7:50 PM last night and dropped bombs until 9:15 PM, dropping a total of over one hundred bombs. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London: The German air raid on Scapa Flow was the first incident causing civilian casualties since the outbreak of the European war. It is believed that there will be a fierce air war between Britain and Germany because of this. Yesterday, the British expeditionary force on the French front cancelled leave for soldiers. At the same time, the British newspapers urged the government to step up the war against Germany. Observers said that the appeal of the press will be greatly supported by the people, and there will be a fierce debate in the House of Commons this week. The British people first heard the news of the Scapa Flow air raid from the radio report at 1:00 PM yesterday. "German planes attacked at 7:30 PM the night before after three days of reconnaissance. One British warship was damaged." The German report stated that four warships were hit, but the British Admiralty denied this. (Associated Press dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>German Squadron Leader Talks About the Air Raid</p>
<p>Berlin: Major Döenitz, the squadron leader of the German Air Force who led the bombing of Scapa Flow the day before, met with foreign journalists yesterday and issued a statement on the bombing of the bay, saying that there were four of the largest British warships in the bay, each of which was hit by at least one heavy bomb. We saw it very clearly when it hit. He then described the details as follows: We have known for several days that there are many British ships in the bay. The weather was clear on the 16th. When we flew to the bay, it was already dusk. The British must have been at dinner, because we had been there for a long time before we heard the sound of anti-aircraft guns, which clearly showed that they had discovered us very late. Although British fighter planes took off to pursue us, they did not achieve much. I personally saw a huge ship engulfed in a cloud of black smoke after being hit, followed by a very intense fire. The bombing was completed at 7:55 PM. We flew back north and saw the four large warships hit and smoking along the way, which was very clear. At the same time, there were still many bullets near some warships. According to Döenitz, the German planes that went to bomb the bay were Heinkel He 111s, all of which returned to base safely. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The British said that one German plane was shot down during the German Air Force bombing of Scapa Flow. Berlin officials declared that all the German planes that went to bomb returned to base safely. If a plane was shot down, it must have been a British plane. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Berlin officials attached great importance to the German Air Force's bombing of the British Scapa Flow air base, believing that Britain's attempt to use the bay to control Norwegian territorial waters had clearly failed. The Sonntags-Zeitung published an editorial stating that "The entire German people firmly believe that the outcome of this war can be determined militarily. The success of the Scapa Flow air raid is the first major blow against the British air force base." (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

Although the fishing boat was hit by machine gun bullets, all the crew members were unharmed and returned to port yesterday. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>Finland and Soviet Union to Exchange Ratification Documents Tomorrow, Finnish Representatives Depart for Moscow to Conduct Border Demarcation and Economic Negotiations</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Minister of State Paasikivi, along with Foreign Minister Väinö Voionmaa, departed for Moscow this morning, scheduled to exchange ratification documents of the peace treaty with the Soviet authorities on the 20th. At the same time, they will also conduct negotiations with the Soviet Union on issues related to the re-demarcation of the border between the two countries, the restoration of diplomatic relations, and economic matters. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Finnish-Soviet peace treaty stipulates that the Hanko Peninsula will be leased to the Soviet Union for 30 years. Observers here commented that the Soviet Union did not ask the Finnish government for land transit rights, so Soviet naval bases will have to maintain transportation with the Hanko Peninsula by sea. However, in winter, the sea in that area is completely frozen, and transportation is difficult. In addition, the administration of the Hanko Peninsula and other issues have not been resolved. Finnish representative Paasikivi will arrive in Moscow on the 19th of this month to exchange ratification documents for the peace treaty, and he will definitely discuss these issues with the Soviet authorities.

<h3>Large Number of Australian Youth Enlist in Air Force</h3>
<p>Canberra: Australia needs to select 55,000 personnel in the Empire Air Training Scheme. 200,000 people are now enlisting and waiting for examination. According to Australian Minister for Air Fairbairn, the estimate of 200,000 people enlisting is based on facts, because air force personnel must have a certain level of education and physical fitness, and most need to have expertise. Even with lenient admission, the number of unqualified applicants will reach as high as 75%. Currently, there are 47,957 people enlisting to be ground and maintenance personnel for the air force, and 8,500 people enlisting to be pilots and other positions on the plane. This proves that Australian youth are very interested in aviation, but not all those who enlist can be admitted. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>British and French Aid Plan for Turkey: Butler Answers Question in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>London: During today's session of the House of Commons, a question was raised to Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Butler, asking whether there was a comprehensive plan between Britain and France to provide immediate military assistance to Turkey should its integrity be threatened or should it need to aid its neighbors. Mr. Butler replied that Britain and France are bound by a mutual assistance treaty. In the event that Turkey is drawn into war due to a European power or is invaded by such a power, they will do their utmost to provide all possible assistance.

Negotiations have been underway for several months, but significant disputes remain to be overcome before a compromise can truly be expected. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Quo Tai-chi on Sino-British Friendship: British Appeasement of Japan Will Affect Friendship with China</h3>
<p>London: Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Quo Tai-chi, recently stated, "Britain needs the friendship of China, but if it adopts an excessively 'appeasement' policy towards Japan, this friendship will inevitably suffer a serious blow." Japan's plans in Asia and the Western Pacific are aimed at Britain, France, the United States, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union, and are not solely directed at China. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Mail Steamer "Fushimi Maru" Subjected to Inspection: Japan to Protest to Britain</h3>
<p>Tokyo: On the night of the 17th, the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line) received a telegram from the "Fushimi Maru" stating that the ship was inspected by British authorities in Singapore on the 16th and that some of its mail was seized. The telegram stated that when the "Fushimi Maru" arrived in Singapore at 11:00 AM on the 16th, inspection officers demanded the handover of sixty-four pieces of mail destined for disembarkation at Naples, Italy. The ship, having no other choice, consulted with the consulate and handed over the mail on the condition that it be returned before the ship's departure. Fifty-two pieces were subsequently returned, but twelve pieces of mail bound for Germany were not returned because the inspection procedures had not been completed. Despite lodging a serious protest with the consul general, the authorities refused to return the mail, and the ship was forced to depart. The ship departed Yokohama on the 26th and was illegally inspected by the British en route in Singapore. Upon receiving the telegram, the Foreign Ministry decided to lodge a serious protest immediately. (Domei News Agency, 18th)</p>

<h3>Pawnshops Surge Across Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo Flight Dispatch: According to statistics released by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, Japan saw a decrease in pawnshops in major cities since the outbreak of the China Incident. Not fearing the long duration of the war and the difficulty of people's livelihood, pawnshops across the country have surged again. Salaried workers often see pawning as a normal practice. Ordinary laborers even pawn items for drinking pleasure. Intellectuals, due to the soaring prices of daily necessities, often pawn items to buy rice and food. There are approximately 1,200 pawnshops across Japan, with a total capital of approximately 16 million yen. The amount of money pawned annually in Tokyo pawnshops ranges from 80 million to 100 million yen. The value of items pledged at ordinary times is also between 25 million and 30 million yen. However, valuable items such as gold watches and rings have mostly been collected by the government during donation campaigns, and are rarely seen in pawnshops. (Havas)</p>
<h3>All India Congress Opens; Leaders of Various Factions Express Opinions</h3>
<p>Ranchi, India: The All India Congress Committee convened here today. Twenty-seven amendments to the Patna Resolution were proposed, including one by Communist representative Batve, advocating political non-cooperation and resistance against British military operations. Communist leader Roy, in explaining his amendment, advocated the immediate establishment of an Indian democratic republic to replace the current government, and severing diplomatic relations with the British government. Gandhi arrived at the meeting at 4:00 PM and will deliver a speech. (United Press, 18th)</p>
<p>Ranchi, India: Indian Communist leader Roy, upon arriving here today, told reporters that Gandhi's policy towards England was too weak. "Our goal is complete independence. We must have the determination to fight for our independence, rather than carefully select the means to achieve independence. Roy believes that now is a golden opportunity for India to seek independence, with England occupied in Western Europe. When asked whether India will adopt the same political line as the United States in the future, Roy replied, "American politics is not democratic politics. Everything in America is in the hands of financiers and industrialists. Roy sighed, stating he had lived in the United States for some time, and also visited the Soviet Union and Mexico. However, Nehru, the nationalist leader of young India, supported Gandhi's proposal, saying, "We must continue to prepare psychologically so that when Gandhi deems the time ripe for the national independence movement, we are ready to act. We are all united on Gandhi's fundamental principles of independence. The only difference is whether Gandhi's plan can be realized." When discussing Gandhi's advocacy of being too moderate, Nehru said, "Although Gandhi's words are moderate, his actions are often stronger than his words. Gandhi sometimes deliberately adopts a moderate tone in his speech." He also said that the All India Congress had only been a protest group in the past, but in recent years, it has assumed administrative responsibilities in some provinces. It is reported that Gandhi will deliver a speech at the All India Congress this week. (United Press, 18th)</p>

<h3>Germany and the Soviet Union Seek to Expand Control over Northern Europe; Small Countries Begin Political Activities; Balkan Countries Unite</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: Following the Soviet-Finnish armistice, the Nordic countries have begun unprecedented diplomatic and political activities. Two points are now clearly visible: (1) Germany and the Soviet Union are both seeking to exploit the anxieties of the Nordic countries to expand their control over Northern Europe; (2) There is fierce debate in Northern Europe about the merits of the Soviet-Finnish settlement, and the internal political situations of some Nordic countries may be affected. It is widely believed that Germany also hopes to participate in the defense alliance proposed by Finland to Sweden and Norway. The arrival of two German officials here at the end of the week is likely related to the current political situation. According to well-informed observers, Germany is currently doubling its propaganda efforts to portray Britain and France as attempting to turn the Scandinavian Peninsula into a battlefield, and is attempting to induce the Nordic countries to seek self-preservation under German protection. It is reported that the attitude of the Scandinavian countries towards this German movement can be expressed in the phrase "Do not separate us from our friends." As for the Soviet Union's efforts to expand its influence, they are even less welcome. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>The Hague: A Berlin correspondent for a local newspaper reports that Germany appears to have begun a campaign to exclude Britain from the Scandinavian market. Using the recent trade agreements concluded by Britain with Norway and Sweden as an excuse, the German government is engaging in urgent negotiations with the Scandinavian countries, explaining the need for true neutrality and stating that Germany can purchase more raw materials and food from the Nordic countries than Britain. While people in Berlin describe these agreements as Britain's attempt to compensate for its diplomatic failure with Finland, they feel that Britain intends to use these agreements to gain control of the Scandinavian coast and have declared that if the Nordic countries allow British warships to exercise this right, it will be a breach of neutrality equivalent to accepting British instigation to stop the exchange of goods with Germany. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: The "Evening News" reports from Moscow that in addition to negotiating a trade agreement with Finland, the Soviet government also intends to negotiate trade and transit agreements with Norway and Sweden, so that Soviet goods can pass through the territories of the two countries and be transported to their western ports. At the same time, they also intend to request that the countries designate free ports for Soviet trade. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>London: According to special dispatches here, Dr. Brant, a former professor at the University of Berlin and currently a professor at Stanford University in the United States, recently published an article stating that if the Allied powers deal with Germany through delaying tactics, the war may be prolonged, but Germany will inevitably fail. Germany can resist the blockade for at least two years under the current war situation. The Soviet Union cannot provide Germany with much assistance because it has not yet satisfied its own needs, and the railways of the Soviet Union and Germany cannot transport oil on a large scale. Germany's difficult problem is the supply of oil. Only with insufficient oil can it not wage a large-scale land war for a long time. What will be the consequences depends largely on the nature of the war in the future. If the Allied powers engage in delays and do not seek a quick battle, the war cannot be ended in a short time, and Germany will eventually fail. It is estimated that in the third or fourth year of the war, Britain and France will be able to destroy the German army with superior military strength.</p>
<p>New York Dispatch: Analyzing the position of the small countries and the pressures forcing them to unite, it states that this evolution is currently underway in the Scandinavian Peninsula, but even in the Balkan Peninsula, countries fearing German and Soviet aggression will gradually change their inherent adversarial attitudes towards each other, and their alliances will eventually tend to be anti-German and anti-Soviet. This is something we must not forget, as the dangers faced by the independence of the small countries of Europe do not come from the Allied powers, but from Germany and the Soviet Union. This is what the small countries are worried about. The degree and timing of the harm caused by yielding to German pressure and the harm caused by yielding to Allied pressure are very different. Even the most uneducated peasants in the Balkans are well aware of this difference. This is the key to understanding the current situation in the Balkan Peninsula. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<h3>Belgian Foreign Minister Reaffirms Neutral Policy</h3>
<p>Brussels: Foreign Minister Spaak recently attended a joint meeting of labor groups in Verviers and delivered a speech on the various current problems facing Belgium, reaffirming Belgium's neutral policy. He stated, "Since Britain and France have already recognized the inviolability of our country's territory, and Germany has also provided the same guarantee, this is clear evidence that our views have been unanimously recognized by our neighbors. Because of our pursuit of a neutral policy, we have been able to avoid war for the past six months, and we hope that we can continue to do so in the future." In addition, Foreign Minister Spaak elaborated on various domestic issues, such as the issue of food supplies and the mobilization of unemployed workers, as well as the issue of suppressing communist activities.

<h3>Romanian Prime Minister Claims National Stability; Continues to Expand Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Bucharest: Prime Minister Tătărescu delivered a radio address to the nation tonight, stating, "Most of the difficulties we have encountered have been overcome, and I believe that we can be more at ease in the future. The reason for this is that the government has worked hard to consolidate its position internationally, but what is especially important is that our army is strong enough to protect our independence and the security of our territory." However, the existing army must continue to be supplemented, and military spending must be increased to achieve perfection. "Although we desire peace, our rights must also be maintained, so we must be prepared and fulfill our highest responsibility to defend our territory." In addition, many members of the fascist Iron Guard have expressed sincerity to the government, and the government's appeasement policy has been remarkably successful, as can be seen from this. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Rumors that a certain country had proposed to Romania to guarantee its borders in exchange for Romania accepting economic or political constraints, or providing compensation, have been firmly denied by Romanian officials. Well-informed sources from Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union also said that they had not heard of it. However, rumors still abound here that Germany and Italy, as well as Germany, the Soviet Union, and Romania, have indeed been in contact on this issue. Certain political figures also said that Prime Minister Tătărescu's radio address yesterday, in which he spoke of the easing of the external and internal situation, was proof that the various rumors were not unfounded.

Economic experts believe that this is evidence that Germany is once again launching an economic offensive against Romania. When Germany and Romania signed an economic protocol last December, Clodius assured the Romanian authorities that as long as Romania faithfully fulfilled its commitments, it would not need to fear Germany. However, at this time, no matter what new proposals Germany makes or what new guarantees it attaches, Romania is unlikely to accept them lightly. A few days ago, Romanian Minister of Foreign Trade Cristu announced that he intended to take various measures to encourage the export of oil to those who pay for goods in cash, such as Egypt (Romania purchases a significant amount of cotton from Egypt), Greece, Britain, France, and Italy. Under these measures, Germany may not benefit. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Iron Guard Detainees Pardoned</h3>
<p>Bucharest: After the fascist Iron Guard expressed its sincerity to the government, the government recently ordered the pardon of 114 members of the group who are currently detained in various locations. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Internal Disputes in Yugoslavia</h3>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia: Rumors of differences of opinion among members of the Yugoslav cabinet on issues such as foreign policy have been denied by well-informed sources here. Government officials here solemnly declare that Yugoslavia's foreign policy is the best guarantee of its security and should continue to be maintained. Only the Serbian opposition is demanding active measures to form a neutral group in Southeast Europe. Other issues on which there are differences of opinion are of a domestic nature, such as the Croatian issue and the issue of the "Peasant Defense Corps." The "Peasant Defense Corps" is a paramilitary organization of the "Croatian Peasant Party." Serbians have expressed their opposition, but Croatians and members of the cabinet have assured the Minister of Defense that the group's mission is to maintain public order and is not of a military nature.

<h3>International Organization to Study Peace Terms; British Labour MP Raises Question</h3>
<p>London: At a meeting this afternoon, Labour MP Hood Pen asked the Prime Minister whether the government would be prepared to establish a federation of committees from various countries in a suitable neutral location, in order to publicly study all responsible proposals for the terms of a lasting world peace, impartially examine all major economic, territorial, and ethnic issues that have led to war, and determine whether there are principles for the peaceful resolution of international disputes that can be universally accepted. Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied that Mr. Hood Pen's ultimate goal certainly met with universal desire, but Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax felt that in the current environment, it was not yet possible to propose practical measures.

<h3>British Diplomatic Circles Observe International Situation</h3>
<p>London – Diplomatic figures have recently commented on the international situation, summarizing the major international events of the past week as follows: (1) The establishment of a peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union; (2) US Under Secretary of State Welles' visits to the capitals of England, France, and Italy; (3) The meeting between German leader Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Brenner Pass. Regarding the first point, the successful mediation of the Finnish-Soviet war by neutral countries has raised hopes for mediating the Western European war. However, England and France seem determined to continue fighting, with no possibility of compromise with Germany. As for German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's trip to Rome, it did not yield substantial results, as Germany's attempt to enlist Italy in joint actions in the Balkans may not be welcomed by Italian authorities. Furthermore, Under Secretary Welles is unlikely to adopt an opposing stance toward England and France. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Comments on the Czech Issue, Refuting British Foreign Secretary's Remarks</h3>
<p>Berlin – The "German Diplomatic-Political Correspondence" stated that British Foreign Secretary Halifax's recent remarks demanding the restoration of Czechoslovakia coincided with the establishment of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. England and France had encouraged Finland to resist, but Finland ended a hopeless war, and Poland ventured into war, ultimately leading to its demise. Halifax attempted to encourage other countries to resist Germany, spoke extravagantly about Germany's oppression of the Czech people, and made promises to restore Czech freedom. However, Czech President Hácha believes that the interests of the Czech people are best guaranteed through cooperation with Germany. The Czech people are under the protection of German troops and are confident that Germany will achieve final victory. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Reshuffle Issue, Former Prime Minister Laval May Succeed as Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Paris – According to political observers, it will be revealed no later than tonight whether French Prime Minister Daladier has decided to reshuffle the cabinet. The major debate in the Chamber of Deputies on Tuesday regarding the Finnish situation may be related to the cabinet reshuffle. The Chamber will use the opportunity to discuss the Finnish issue to question the government about the cabinet's composition. Political circles have been discussing the form the cabinet change will take since the end of last week, generally agreeing that forming a wartime cabinet headed by Daladier is highly likely, which would lead to a complete reshuffle of all departments. Some sources anticipate that former Prime Minister Laval may be asked to assume the post of Foreign Minister, while a certain member of the current government will be appointed as France's first Director of Intelligence.

<h3>Trade Difficulties Between England and the United States</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency's airmail communication states that in peacetime, the total value of American goods purchased by the British mainland exceeds the total value of British goods exported to the United States by approximately £80 million annually. If the self-governing territories are included, the trade deficit will increase by another £15 million. However, British territories have a trade surplus of approximately £35 million with the United States annually. Therefore, observing the overall trade balance of the British Empire, the goods purchased from the United States are ultimately more than those sold to it. In peacetime, England already finds it financially difficult to make up for the aforementioned trade deficit. Therefore, shortly before the outbreak of the European war, a British-American trade agreement was drafted as a remedial measure. In recent years, the annual value of American goods imported by England has been £100 million. During the last year or two of World War I, due to the war, the total value of American goods imported by England reached £300 million annually. Now that the price of the British pound has decreased, the prices of military supplies have soared, and England again needs to purchase military supplies from the United States, will the financial difficulties encountered in the future not be even greater? Moreover, the United States has recently added "cash and carry" provisions, making things even more difficult for England. The British government certainly wants to increase the quantity of goods sold to the United States. Although there is a possibility of increasing the purchase of rubber and tin produced by British territories, the value of the goods increased annually will ultimately not exceed £15 million, which cannot make up for the losses. England has also considered measures to restrict the import of non-essential goods. Except for military supplies, which are urgently needed and difficult to restrict, England has already ordered a large quantity of Egyptian cotton, accounting for the majority of its production. England is also obligated to purchase a considerable quantity of tobacco produced in Turkey. From this, it can be seen that there are obstacles to England's desire to restrict the quantity of imported non-essential goods. Currently, it can be predicted that England will likely stop purchasing American-made cars and will try its best to purchase food produced by the self-governing territories to replace American goods, but the effect of this method will ultimately be limited. Another strategy is to increase the export of gold. The British Empire produces gold worth approximately £100 million annually. Recently, a large amount of gold has been imported into the United States. To alleviate England's trade deficit with the United States, it is necessary to further increase the export of gold to make up for it. However, there is no certainty as to how much the increase will be. In short, after overall planning, the question of how England will raise funds to pay for goods imported from the United States has not only not been resolved, but also feels extremely thorny. The British government certainly does not want to see various unfavorable reactions occur in the British Empire's markets and in the South American markets, but if the war is prolonged, these reactions may be unavoidable.</p>
<h3>Snowflakes Fall in Laohekou in Spring</h3>

<h3>National Government Actively Develops Resources, Establishes New Economic Foundation, Unleashes Enormous Capacity, Abundant Finances, Budget Increases Little, Stable Currency Value, Gold Travels in Chongqing, Returns to Shanghai, Discusses Impressions</h3>
<p>Gold, the editor of the English-language "China Press," recently traveled to Chongqing and wrote an impression piece, published in the newspaper. A common question in people's minds is how long China and Japan can sustain their efforts. At the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War in 1937, knowledgeable experts predicted that this war of attrition would last for one or at most two years, and both countries would inevitably collapse. As for which side would collapse first, it depended on one's sympathies and point of view. Today, after a long period of testing, Japan has clearly shown signs of being under heavy pressure and has begun to show cracks, but it is still able to continue fighting. As for free China, it has a vast and fertile hinterland, and its potential is surprisingly great. Merchants from the coastal ports and the wealthy people who previously resided in Nanjing, along with knowledgeable Chinese people, are deeply patriotic and have come to Chongqing. They have discovered that the wartime capital is developing in many ways and is intensifying its efforts to continue the war. The situation is expected to continue to improve, and there is no dissent, whether privately or publicly, regarding the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction.</p>
<p>Finances are Sound and Not Threatened by Scarcity</p>
<p>The government's finances have not collapsed. It is true that the exchange rate of the legal currency has tightened and prices have risen, but these are not signs of currency or financial collapse. Vice Minister of Finance Xu Kan stated, "Our plan is for a long-term War of Resistance. China is an agricultural country with abundant food, clothing, and daily necessities. Our country has a vast land and enormous human and financial resources. The three key points of wartime finance are (1) increasing production. The budget for agricultural credit loans has been greatly increased this year;</p>
<p>Developing Resources, Prospering the Market</p>
<p>(2) Developing natural resources, especially minerals. Free China has far more natural resources than the occupied areas; (3) Rapidly developing light industry. Today, banks are established in the remote west to build the foundation for economic activity, with the aim of expanding production facilities to increase domestic products. Now, thirty-two months into the war, there is no concern about shortages of food and other necessities. European countries must immediately implement a rationing system when they encounter war. Our people continue to operate their businesses, which are very prosperous, as if there were no war. This is not superficial prosperity, but prosperity based on unleashing enormous capacity. With this as a basic principle, we can fight indefinitely. Our country maintains sufficient reserves while striving to prevent inflation and engaging in economic development.</p>
<p>Special Efforts to Develop the Economy</p>
<p>Our policy is to place government finances on a commercial basis. The money spent on agricultural projects will be doubled." The Chinese government is now making special efforts to promote development according to local needs, and each war zone has a special economic committee to combat the monopolistic activities of the Japanese in their semi-occupied areas. According to a government spokesperson, the guerrillas have been very successful in preventing the Japanese from forcibly seizing agricultural products from farmers. It is reported that in Sichuan alone, the government's four major banks are preparing to allocate 100 million yuan for agricultural credit loans.</p>
<p>Budget Significantly Lower Than Japan's</p>
<p>China's current budget is about three times that of 1934, but government officials claim that the budget should be based on 1937, when the war broke out, and today's budget has increased little compared to 1937. As for military spending, the claim that it accounts for three-quarters of the total budget has been denied by the Ministry of Finance. According to Minister Kong, Japan's debts and expenses are far greater than China's, and China's budget is insignificant compared to those of countries like England and France. Furthermore, China's currency is fundamentally sound. As for China's income, although customs duties, salt taxes, and consolidated taxes have all been greatly reduced, the losses have been offset by income tax and excess profits tax. The purchase of foreign goods is less than before, but many necessities are still obtained through foreign loans and barter trade.</p>

<h3>All Circles Commemorate the March 18th Massacre Yesterday, National Spirit Was Even More Vigorous After the Beijing Tragedy</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the March 18th Massacre, and all circles mourned deeply. At that time in 1926, the National Revolutionary Army and the Fengtian Army were at war, and the National Revolutionary Army blockaded the Dagukou, which led to diplomatic negotiations. On March 18th, the people of Beijing, motivated by righteous indignation, petitioned the State Council but were not accepted. Furthermore, they were shot at, resulting in the deaths of more than 20 petitioners and students. Since the occurrence of this tragedy, the national spirit has become even more vigorous, and people's awareness of national affairs has gradually awakened.</p>
<h3>All Trade Unions Support National Policy, Ministry Sends Telegram to Express Condolences and Encouragement, Hoping for Continued Efforts, Striving for Final Victory</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 18th – The Central Department of Social Affairs recently sent a telegram to more than 100 trade unions, including the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, denying their support for "peace," and sent a special telegram to Shanghai to express condolences and encouragement. The original telegram stated, "(Title omitted) Your associations have jointly sent a telegram, solemnly denying the so-called 'peace' proposal, firmly expressing support for the Commander-in-Chief and the national policy of resistance. This shows that although our workers are temporarily isolated and subject to oppression, their awareness of resistance has not wavered, and their patriotic enthusiasm has only increased. This is commendable. It is hoped that you will continue your efforts and strive for final victory. Central Department of Social Affairs."</p>
<h3>Elder Mr. Qin Yanqi's Funeral Held Yesterday, Public Organizations Discuss Commemoration</h3>
<p>Mr. Qin Yanqi, the general director of the Shanghai Charity Association, unfortunately passed away from illness the day before yesterday (the 16th). He was a Jinshi from the late Qing Dynasty, and his writing and morality were comparable to those of Lu Ling. He once held office in Hubei, earning a reputation for his political achievements. After the founding of the Republic, he served as a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Assembly, making proposals and abolishing evils, benefiting his hometown. He participated in compiling the Shanghai County Annals and editing the posthumous works of famous figures, drawing on a wide range of sources and demonstrating extraordinary precision. He was diligent in his writing and continued to be so in his old age. After the August 13th Incident, he continued to serve as a director of various charitable organizations, planning meticulously and remaining unblemished. This year, he was 80 years old and happily revisited Pan Shui. He composed a poem to record his feelings, and many people wrote in response. His old friends planned to offer him a cup of wine to celebrate his birthday, but unexpectedly, the news of his death spread, causing grief and regret to those who heard it. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the funeral was held at the Shanghai Funeral Home. More than 1,000 people attended, including Chen Taoyi, Shen Xinqing, Huang Hanzhi, Wen Lanting, Xi Yushu, Li Guiyong, Yan Shuhe, Jin Jushan, Mao Zijian, Yan Weilian, Zhou Jinghan, Zhu Yinjiang, Pei Yunqing, Ma Jiliang, Su Zugui, Yao Lizhi, and Qu Shaoqi. Organizations included the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association, the Shanghai Charity Association Federation, the Shanghai County Local Property Office, the Relief Association for Women and Children, the Yimiao Board of Directors, the Xin Pu Yu Tang, the Disabled Persons' Home, the Hu Nan Charity Association, the Pu Yi Vocational Training Institute, the Bao An Nursing Home, the Xin Pudong Newspaper, the Chinese Vocational Education Society, and more than 30 other organizations. Schools included Dajiang, Minli, Songhu, Sisheng, Xiang Yao, Sanlin, Zhonghua Vocational, Jisheng, and other primary and secondary schools, all of which sent representatives to pay their respects solemnly. Carriages and horses were crowded, and condolence banners were displayed everywhere, showing the utmost grief and honor. His son, Zhizhi Quanjiu, is also young and talented, able to read his father's books and carry on his legacy. It is also heard that various public organizations, remembering his hard work, plan to privately honor him with the posthumous title "Jing Hui Gong" to express their admiration. Therefore, a meeting will be convened soon to plan the ceremony and express their condolences together.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Wenzhou Ships Open to Passengers, Large Numbers of Passengers Travel There, Please Facilitate Entry at the Shipping Administration Office</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of passengers on Shanghai-Wenzhou ships, after the Wenzhou Fellow Villagers Association sent a letter to various shipping companies requesting them to purchase more tickets, the shipping companies believe that as long as passengers do not travel in stages, they should be allowed to board as much as possible. It is reported that in addition to deciding to strictly handle fellow villagers returning to their hometowns, the association has also sent a letter to the Wenzhou-Taiwan Shipping Administration Office, stating that for fellow villagers returning to their hometowns who have a genuine guarantee from the Fellow Villagers Association, they should be facilitated for entry to benefit commerce, transportation, and navigation. It has also been learned that recently, many fellow villagers from Wenzhou have requested the Fellow Villagers Association to provide guarantees for returning to their hometowns. The British ship "Xin An Tong" departed from Shanghai for Wenzhou yesterday afternoon, with a large number of passengers on board, marking the beginning of the opening of Shanghai-Wenzhou ships to passengers.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses Continuing to Sell Flour at Reduced Prices, Original Reduced Price Period Ends Tomorrow, Reduced Price for Next Period Not Yet Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>After the price of flour in the city rose, the Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to suppress the price and relieve the people's food difficulties, previously consulted with the Fufeng and Fuxin flour mills. From February 19th to March 19th, for a total of 30 days, they supplied 7,500 bags of flour at reduced prices every day, which were sold at reduced prices by 27 flour shops in the two concessions to regulate the market. During this month, a total of 225,000 bags of flour were sold at reduced prices, resulting in significant losses for the factories. The Chairman of the Council, Mr. Fackeley, has sent a special letter to the two factories to express his gratitude. However, it is heard that regarding the continuation of reduced prices, the price of imported wheat, the raw material, has recently risen sharply. The Municipal Council, in order to take into account both the factory's costs and the suppression of the selling price, has been actively consulting with the two factories mentioned above on the reduced price for the next period. The process has been underway for nearly a week and has not yet been finalized. Negotiations are still ongoing, and an announcement will be made once the price is agreed upon, so that regulation can continue. The Noodle Industry Association has notified all stores that after March 19th, they should continue to operate as usual. If they have to purchase recycled flour, they may increase the price appropriately due to cost considerations to meet retail sales.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Tries to Reduce Food for Prison Inmates, Starting with Reducing Rice Rations, Trial Period Set for Three Months</h3>
<p>Amidst the opposition to increasing the municipal tax, the Shanghai Municipal Council suddenly issued a public notice yesterday, stating that it has been decided to find ways to conserve food for prisoners in the Ward Road Jail from mid-March onwards in order to reduce the Municipal Council's expenditures for this year. The Ward Road Jail has a wide range and holds more than 8,500 people (mostly Chinese). The Chinese government has never borne any of their expenses. At a time when rice is expensive, the Municipal Council, seeing that the expenses of the Ward Road Jail are increasing daily and that the increase in taxes is opposed by all parties, generally believes that this move by the Municipal Council is the first step in responding to the opposition to raising taxes.</p>
<p>Preliminary Investigation</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's expenditure on food for prison inmates was originally set at 79,000 yuan per month in the preliminary budget for this year, but in reality, since January of this year, this expenditure has increased to 135,000 yuan per month. Even if food prices do not rise again in the future, the total expenditure on prisoner food for the entire year is estimated to reach 1.6 million yuan, exceeding the preliminary budget by 600,000 yuan and increasing by about 1.17 million yuan compared to the previous year. In view of this, the Council organized a special committee, together with representatives from various departments and experts from the Health Department, to conduct an investigation into food for prisoners. The committee members are McDonald, Xu Xiaochu, Li Wenjie, and Xu Naili.</p>
<p>Current Measures</p>
<p>In the past, suggestions for reducing food for prisoners have been repeatedly opposed, on the grounds that reducing food would increase the morbidity and mortality rates of prisoners. The current table of dietary quantities for prisoners was previously compiled by the Health Department using scientific methods and is very precise. At the same time, attention has been paid to the nutrients contained in the diet. The diet for prisoners is currently divided into three types: high, medium, and low, depending on whether the prisoner is working, whether they have been diagnosed by a doctor, and whether they are being punished. In addition, prisoners suffering from tuberculosis and other diseases are given special diets. The committee has also paid attention to the morbidity and mortality rates of prisoners.</p>
<p>Reducing Rice Rations</p>
<p>According to the committee's statement, its main purpose is to adjust both the needs of prison food and the necessary savings in the bureau's expenses for the sake of taxpayers' interests. In the past, all purchases of prison food were made through public bidding, and the lowest bids were selected. Therefore, it is believed that there is no waste in the food for prisoners. At present, the rice supplied to prisoners is inexpensive brown rice. The committee has carefully reviewed all the ingredients of prison food and considered whether they can be reduced. As a result, it has suggested to the Council that the rice ration in prison food should be reduced as a trial. The trial period is set for one month. The above suggestion has been adopted by the Council.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side to Revise the Nine-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>A spokesperson for the Japanese Consulate declared yesterday at a reception for journalists that the Nine-Power Treaty, like clothes from the past, is no longer applicable to the present and should be discarded. When asked when the Japanese side would announce the abolition of the treaty, the spokesperson said that in fact, it is necessary to revise this treaty significantly. The spokesperson continued that, from a legal point of view, Japan does not seem to need to fully comply with the various principles stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty. When asked whether this measure would affect the rights and interests of Americans in China, the spokesperson replied that the principle of Japan's policy is to try its best to avoid conflicts with the rights and interests of third countries in China.</p>

<h3>Children's Day Preparatory Committee Holds Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Various organizations have jointly established a preparatory committee for this year's April 4th Children's Day to carry out preparatory work.

It is reported that the committee will hold a committee meeting this afternoon to intensify the preparatory work and discuss everything.</p>
<h3>The Third Round of Government Rice Sales to Begin Today; Scheduled to End Temporarily on April 7th; Rice Prices Continue to Decline in the Market Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The third round of government rice sales will begin today. All procedures will be the same as in the first and second rounds, and it is scheduled to end temporarily on April 7th (end of the second month of the lunar calendar). The police departments of the two concessions have issued announcements at the various sales locations, requiring all civilians purchasing rice to maintain order and follow the instructions of the police officers to avoid accidents. The Rice Dealers Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Stabilization Committee yesterday, reporting that the locations of the three sale points have been</p>
<p>Confirmed and updated.</p>
<p>Therefore, the order during this round of sales is expected to be even more organized. Yesterday morning, after the market opened at 9 a.m., market sentiment continued to be bearish, and prices fell again. Saigon and other types of rice had dropped to 39 yuan, and other types of rice also continued to decline. A member of the Rice Industry Committee stated that the reasons for the recent decline in rice prices were</p>
<p>Due to the reasons for the price decline</p>
<p>Nothing more than an oversupply and slow sales. There were more sellers than buyers in the market, and due to tight credit conditions, large dealers were selling off large quantities of imported rice. Furthermore, warehouses were full to capacity, and storage fees were increasing. At the same time, buyers, seeing rice prices falling, adopted a wait-and-see attitude and were unwilling to continue purchasing, resulting in supply exceeding demand. Spot goods were readily available. Moreover, market firms were required to use cash notes. Therefore,</p>
<p>Illegal activities were suspected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bean and Rice Industry Association previously received a letter from Xing Zhigang, a standing committee member of the association, stating that robberies were rampant in the cargo docks, disrupting business. He requested that a letter be sent to the Municipal Council for serious action. The association has now forwarded the letter to the authorities for approval and implementation.</p>

<h3>Numerous Cases of Murder and Robbery; Large Group of Bandits Captured; However, Box Guns Were Taken by Fugitives</h3>
<p>At 2:00 p.m. on the 15th of this month, the French police received a tip that a large group of bandits was hiding at No. 22 Yuqing Lane, Ruli Bridge. They immediately dispatched detectives Sui Wenzhi, Ma Changxin, and officers Shao Guanrong, Cao Jiazhen, and others, discreetly proceeding to the address. On the spot, they captured Wang Shaoting, Wang Deqing, Chen Shouheng, Zu Guanghua, Ge Mingcai, Lu Jiantang, Ge Ziyu, a woman named Ge Wang, Chen Pu, Yuan Zhang, Li Wang, Wang Cai, Chen Zhou, all from Anhui Province, totaling thirteen people. They were taken to the police station and confessed that in July of last year, Wang Shaoting, Chen Shouheng, Zu Guanghua, and fugitives Zhu Zhenglong and Li Jinzhang, six people in total, had shot and robbed their fellow villager Shen Ganting, who ran a water-boiling stall, on a wasteland near Tongwen College on Hongqiao Road. Last winter, they also robbed a rice store on Kaizier Road and a milk booth on Ancient Priest Road. In January of this year, they robbed several thousand yuan in cash from Tiansheng Cloth Store on Annakin Road. They also confessed that three box guns and two pistols were hidden at the home of their fellow villager Gu Congyin at No. 3 Fenjin Lane, Xiahfei Road. The detectives went to the address, but the weapons had already been taken away by the fugitive Zhu and Li upon hearing the news. Only Gu Congyin was arrested.

<h3>West Shanghai Pseudo-Market Reportedly Opening; No Local Merchants Participating</h3>
<p>The so-called "Central Vegetable Market" was originally scheduled to open at the beginning of the month, but the date was temporarily changed. Therefore, it is still in a state of suspension. The "West Shanghai Vegetable Market," a branch located at the corner of Bailinan Road and Zhongshan Road in West Shanghai, has completed the construction of its three-story market building, and is reportedly scheduled to officially open on the 25th of this month. The market management will be handled by a "committee" that elected "Chairman" Zhang Longhai (owner of Zhang Yitai Local Produce Company), "Committee Members" Zhang Zhaokui (of Tongxing Company), Xue Xiaodi (of Yuxing Company), and Xu Jianqiu (of Longtai Company). In the future, if local goods companies want to join the "market" to do business, they will be divided into "three levels": "Grade A" requires a capital contribution of 800 yuan, "Grade B" 400 yuan, and "Grade C" 200 yuan. Yesterday morning at 10 a.m., the entire "market" committee held an inaugural meeting at the Yijia Chun Restaurant in the Caojiadu Triangular Market. However, most local goods companies and vegetable vendors in West Shanghai have an opposing attitude towards the "vegetable market" which has the nature of control, so few have joined to date. The talk of opening on schedule is feared to remain just a dream. (Hua Guang News Agency)</p>

<h3>Domestic Postage to Increase Soon; Shanghai Will Implement the Increase Uniformly</h3>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Shanghai Postal Administration, regarding the rumor that domestic postal rates will increase starting April 1, although the bureau has not yet received an order from the Kunming Postal Ministry, news from postal bureaus in the Northwest confirms that this is indeed the case.

<h3>Police Departments of Both Concessions Deny Advocating Peace</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Evening News stated that senior Chinese officials of the Municipal Council and Police Department of the Public Concession and the Municipal Council and Police Department of the French Concession unanimously denied yesterday morning that they had declared support for the "Peace Movement" and refuted the news as completely "made out of nothing." According to Chinese officials from the Municipal Council, although there are currently many Chinese officials in the two concessions, they are all heavily burdened with work and have no time to engage in politics. Furthermore, they firmly believe that all Chinese officials would definitely not agree with the so-called "Peace Movement." Chinese officials from the Police Department said that if they had supported the "Peace Movement," the Police Department would definitely know about it, but they have not heard of such action, which proves that it is completely a "rumor."</p>

<h3>Finland Holds World Games Problem Finnish Committee Discusses at the End of the Month International Conference Decides in May</h3>
<p>(Paris, 17th, Havas) The Paris Evening Post correspondent in the Netherlands recently wired that the Finnish Olympic Committee recently held a meeting in the capital of the country to discuss the question of whether the Olympic Movement Games this year should be held. After a long period of debate, the majority of the committee members believed that it should still be held as scheduled. Although several countries are currently at war and transportation is difficult, Finland can take this opportunity to attract tourists from neutral countries to assist in the country's reconstruction. This opportunity should not be ignored. However, the duration of the meeting can be reduced from two weeks to one week, and several competition programs, especially yachting, rowing, and equestrian competitions, will be cancelled. It is hoped that at least fifteen countries, including the United States, Italy, and Japan, will participate in the competition, so that the grand occasion of the conference can still be maintained. The Finnish Olympic Committee is scheduled to continue discussing this matter at the end of this month, but the final decision will be made by the International Olympic Committee at its meeting in May this year.</p>

<h3>Securities Public Bonds Sweep Away the Dull Air Jardine Matheson Stock Creates a New High Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the securities gray market was quite volatile. On the one hand, futures trading is about to be realized, and on the other hand, the exchange rate is softening, and people are excited. Category C stocks suddenly broke through the nine yuan mark, and Category B stocks also broke through the fifty yuan mark. The dull situation for many days has suddenly been unfolded. The market atmosphere is tense, and the demand for Category C stocks is high, and the chips suddenly reported exhaustion, and the future has revealed a glimmer of dawn. Yesterday's process, the momentum in the morning was still relatively firm, but with Xinfu, Tianshengchangji, Dakangcheng and Tongshun and others constantly absorbing, Jiufenghao and Lianhe and others sold out one after another, and the market was still in short supply, so the morning was good for two or three corners. In the afternoon, due to difficulty in selling and borrowing, the chips saw exhaustion. After the opening, among the many buy-ins, Category C stocks suddenly rushed to nine yuan, and Category B stocks also broke through the fifty yuan mark. Lianyi and Lianhe turned empty to many, Xinfu and Changji resumed adding codes, Dafengshun Kang, Tongkang and others all had buy-ins, Jiufeng continued to sell, Yongfeng Datong Tiansheng all had sell-offs, but the market atmosphere was very strong, and it was still very firm after the close. In summary, the market price results were consistent, rising another six and a half corners to eight and a half corners, and the transaction was about 1.5 million yuan. The concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 30 shares of Family Industrial Cooperative shares were traded, and the price was 52 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions of the Public Association were quite stable, with extremely small ups and downs. Only the Shanghai Silver Company and Jardine Matheson stocks were still in high demand, and the Shanghai Silver Company traded very smoothly and the price was firm. The buying price was 24 yuan and 75 cents. Jardine Matheson shares opened at 117 yuan, and due to rumors that the company had made huge profits, the price gradually rose, reaching 122 yuan.

<h3>Grain Early Rice Has Been Opened at the Limit Price Saigon Fell into the 40 Yuan Mark Reason Arrival Stockpiling Is Congested, Silver Is Tight, And Warehouse Rent Is Increased, It Is Not Good to Hoard</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market continued to plummet, which was more severe than before. The prices of various foreign rice continued to plummet by as much as two yuan. If the number one Saigon has fallen into the 40 yuan mark, the seller is 39 yuan, and the white early rice that has long disappeared in the market also has a pond market Su Geng that has opened a stream according to the limit of 40 yuan, which is like a spring thunder that bursts out and is deeply shocking. The reason why the rice price has been falling all the way is that the arrival is prosperous and the sales are sluggish. The Shanghai warehouse storage is abundant, and a large number of foreign rice is still pouring in continuously. The silver required is heavy. To facilitate the turnover, there is only a quick release. Naizuoke's aspect was initially still trying to take advantage of the cheap activity, but after day after day, it was all a loss, and they were surprised to be wary and shrink back. As a result, the more it fell, the more dull it became, the more dull it became, and the wind of falling day by day, at a time when it fell sharply, although the general merchants in the early market intended to persist to the end, the scattered households were afraid and fell again and again, until the end of the midday market, the prices of various foreign rice continued to fall by about two yuan, and the transaction volume in the whole market was even rarer than before, only about three or four thousand bags, and Erhaixiang and Xiaozhe original packages were reduced to forty-four and a half yuan, and there was still a lack of big households asking. Although the overseas pricing does not require it, there are a large number of deposits and continuous arrivals, and Willy Han Company has increased the Jinliyuan warehouse rent to 94 cents, in order to promote customers to pick up goods. Therefore, all the hoarders are eager to sell, which is also one of the reasons for the sharp drop in foreign rice.</p>
<p>The price of glutinous rice has always been low, although it has not fallen as sharply as foreign rice. It is estimated that yesterday it fell to one yuan. The state rice such as thick and thin glutinous rice, although the pond market su rice was seen on the market, there has been a limited number of streams opened, but the high-priced goods are still silent, and the private estimates in the outer market are also extraordinarily bleak, and the market is also declining step by step by one yuan.</p>
<p>Another 4,540 bags of foreign sugar arrived, which were shipped from Haiphong on the Taisheng ship of the Yihai Foreign Company and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (17th). It was completely unloaded yesterday.</p>
<h3>New Offerings from Flour Mills: Discussions Underway</h3>

The flat sale of flour, lasting a month, expires today. A total of 225,000 bags were sold at a reduced price of $10.30 each. The mills effectively received $10 per bag, with $0.30 as commission for the selling vendors. With the flat sale period ending, there is talk of price increases from the mills. It is rumored that an agreement has been reached for a price of $14 per bag, an increase of $4.</p>
<p>Wheat: Prices have been falling for days, as factories have pre-ordered foreign wheat. In addition to the recent arrival of over 1,000 tons of wheat, a large volume will soon arrive in Shanghai. Suzhou wheat was sold at the market at $24 per load. Fuxin Factory purchased 3,200 bags at $23.50, a decrease of $0.30-0.50 from last week.</p>

<h3>American Dollar Notes: Severe Price Drop</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market was marked by the sharpest fall in American dollar notes, with abundant supply from all sides. In the afternoon, the rate fell as low as $15.17.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Registered Yarn Volume Small, Bullish Traders Increase Holdings: Remains Above the $1,000 Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn market is quiet and stable, but the American dollar continues to strengthen, and overseas Indian and American cotton markets are trending downwards. As a result, retail investors generally expect a decline. However, demand for 20-count Double Horse yarn from Southern Chaozhou and Hong Kong remains strong. It is also said that the amount registered by borrowers with the Shenxin Factory is only over 300 bales. Bullish traders believe that inventory is not high and sales are good, further strengthening their bullish view on Double Horse yarn. Therefore, the yarn market is currently showing a difficult situation of both advancing and retreating.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened with strong sentiment as Chaozhou suddenly bought spot Double Horse yarn, causing the market to rise to $974. However, with the exchange rate strengthening, the market had the potential to weaken. Support from actual sales provided temporary support. Unexpectedly, with the American dollar continuing to strengthen, the market showed weakness. Three-month Double Horse yarn fell from $974 to $965. In an instant, bullish traders bought again, causing the price to rebound to $971 at closing. The total transaction volume for half a day was 2,250 bales.

<h3>Cotton Sales Sluggish: Market Falls by About One Dollar</h3>

The transaction details of raw cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>According to other reports, overseas cotton prices in the New York cotton market were weak in the early morning due to selling on Wall Street and profit-taking by some bullish traders. As a result, closing prices fell by over ten pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton fell by eight rupees, including forecasts. Egyptian cotton fell by over ten pounds.</p>
<p>Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai has been quiet recently, as Indian cotton is cheaper than American cotton. In addition, Indian cotton has continued to decline recently.

Trading may be difficult to start in the coming days. The shipping price to factories converted to the American dollar at $6.375 is listed below:</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Trading Shifts to Futures</h3>
<p>Sales of cotton cloth are still good, but there is sufficient inventory in the market, making it difficult to turn over capital. As a result, speculative trading is shifting towards futures, showing a near-term weak, long-term tight situation. Spot prices are stable. Ewo's 13-pound coarse cloth is up $0.50. April cloth prices are $0.25 to $0.50 higher per bolt than spot prices. Zhejiang and Anhui traders are handling over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and bleached cloth.

The market has retreated, falling $0.15 to $0.25 per bolt. However, mid-range fine cloth is being purchased by Tianjin traders and dyeing factories, with 500 to 600 bales traded. Therefore, Yanghe, Caqiu, and other brands have fallen by only $0.15 per bolt. Longtou fine cloth is weak in the near term and strong in the long term. New warehouse singles are currently listed at $17.95 at closing, while the price for next month is still $29.10. Four Gentlemen Serge is also best priced for next month, trading at $0.088 per yard.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Warehouse Rent Increase, Soybeans Fall Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market repeatedly plummeted, falling by $1-2 compared to last Saturday. This was due to the implementation of rent increases by most warehouses and tight capital, making it difficult for speculators to hold their positions. They were eager to sell, but buyers were hesitant, causing prices to fall step by step. Lower-grade goods have fallen below the $20 mark. Only Nanjing beans were sold in three loads on this street for $21.00 to $20.05. Over 1,000 bags of Wuhu beans were sold for $22.20 to $19.80.

<h3>Rehashed Old News: 67 Years Ago (428) (See This Newspaper from the 12th Year of the Tongzhi Reign of the Late Qing Dynasty)</h3>
<p>Misfortune and Fortune Intertwined</p>
<p>Among the myriad things that fill the world, everything is unequal. What is created will be destroyed, what gathers will scatter. Even the purest and noblest things, such as calligraphy, paintings, and literary artifacts, once treasured and accumulated excessively, are begrudged by the Creator. In ancient times, the Tang Dynasty collected calligraphy and paintings, filling secret archives. Taking Wang Xizhi's works as an example, it is said that there were over 5,000 pieces, all bearing the Zhenguan authentication seal, with jade axes and ivory labels, representing the height of the era. However, within a few centuries, Huang Chao's rebellion reduced everything to ashes. In more recent times, Grand Secretary Ruan Yuan collected ancient and modern books, surpassing all others in the southeast. Yet, within a few decades, they were consumed by fire. If books and rubbings are destroyed by excessive accumulation, how much more so are gold, silver, and wealth? Therefore, Qian Qianyi said, "National treasures should circulate." The meaning is clear and understandable. But fools do not see this, wasting their entire lives seeking constant accumulation without circulation, accumulating without exchange, relying on abacuses to calculate tirelessly. The more they calculate, the more enjoyable it becomes, until they calculate that no one in the world can match them. Then, the great abacus of Heaven appears. Tracing back to the founding of the Ming Dynasty in Nanjing, Emperor Taizu was besieged in the north by Chen Youliang and in the south by Zhang Shicheng, holding only a small territory with insufficient supplies. A man from Anhui deeply understood the secret of marketable goods,竭尽输将. Emperor Taizu deeply appreciated this. Later, Emperor Taizu unified the country and rewarded功行赏. The man from Anhui declined, saying, "We are all merchants and should not serve as officials." Therefore, Emperor Taizu granted the salt monopoly to Anhui. Thus, from the current dynasty to the provinces that respond to rural lifting, only Anhui merchants have commercial status. For a time, the people of Anhui accumulated wealth daily, and almost all the wealth of the world was calculated. The merchants returned to their hometown every three years, happily performing operas to thank the gods in the Yellow Mountains, imitating the ancient village wine ceremony, called the Yellow Mountain Meeting, seated in order of wealth. Those with more gold sat in the first seat.</p>

<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>Education by Intimidation</h3>
<p>— Yan Quan</p>
<p>A person in a normal state must have a normal psychology. To cultivate a normal psychology, it must begin with childhood. In modern times, with the continuous evolution of education, school education is gradually focusing on child psychology. Many progressive educators in Europe and the United States have shifted their attention to child education, and are actively promoting the education of children under six years old. Because the first six years of childhood is a period of rapid growth, and all of a person's habits, psychology, and actions are formed during this period. According to the results of psychological experiments, once habits are formed, it is more difficult to change them. Especially in adulthood, changing habits becomes extremely difficult. Therefore, the education of young children is particularly worthy of attention.</p>
<p>China's early childhood education is still in its infancy, and the care of young children mostly rests with mothers. The traditional methods of Chinese mothers to teach children are nothing more than deception or intimidation. For example, when a mother sees a child leaving food in his bowl, she deceives him with superstitions:</p>
<p>"The thunder god is going to strike. Someone used to be like you, and he was struck dead by the heavens." If a child cries at night, she will say, "Ghosts are coming, wild cats are coming." This causes the child to be stained with a layer of superstition in gods and ghosts and fear of dark animals or hatred of animals. Some mothers are even worse. They intimidate children in the dark, often saying, "The red-headed Indian is coming, foreigners are coming, or even someone from a certain country." In this way, a shadow of racial inferiority is cast on the weak mind of the child, or it can deepen racial hatred. I used to have a neighbor mistress who loved her son very much. After her son fell, she often transferred her anger to the maids, and sometimes even kicked the tables and chairs, which had fallen by themselves. She would always hit the tables and chairs to vent her son's anger. Although it could temporarily divert the child's attention or cause him to smile, it invisibly cultivated the child's habit of hitting tables, throwing bowls, kicking doors, and hitting walls, which would burden the mother instead. Also, if a child is subjected to excessive intimidation, it can not only make his ideas incorrect, but also manifest in dreams at night, and even lead to psychological disorders. Conversely, if a child is excessively spoiled by his family, he is also being deceived in an invisible way. If he is separated from his mother, he will feel the pain of not being able to adapt to the environment, especially towards group life, and will have various negative feelings. The general mistresses in Shanghai tell servants to lead the children, usually saying "deceive the children." It seems that adults do not need to have a sincere psychology towards young children, as long as the children do not cry or make noise, then they are the best nannies.</p>
<p>Deception and intimidation give children many incorrect knowledge and incorrect ideas and psychology. We should not scold children for having bad tempers, nor should we hate children for being stupid. Every parent should reflect on themselves, how much deception and intimidation have you given to these small lives?</p>
<p>We see that in this era, many seasoned adults can still be psychologically disordered by small threats and inducements. Then, the weak minds of children should not be educated by "deception" and "intimidation."</p>
<p>We protest against the general adults implementing intimidation on children!</p>
<p>Random Thoughts</p>
<h3>Word Count</h3>
<p>— Competition</p>
<p>Writing articles and being concerned about the word count is usually something for those who write for a living, except when it comes to meeting certain exam requirements or regulations like "requires above a certain number of words" or "limited to a certain number of words."</p>
<p>Since newspapers and magazines started soliciting articles and established payment standards such as "a certain amount of money per thousand words," many people have been practicing their 'stretching skills'. They deliberately stretch an opinion that could be expressed in three hundred words to five hundred or eight hundred words, simply because they cannot earn more if they don't. As a result, one often sees articles that are simple in content but extraordinarily long, articles that are thousands of words long but empty of substance.</p>
<p>I once heard a 'writer's' grand pronouncement: 'Writing novels is better than writing essays.' Immediately, I humbly said, 'I would like to hear the reasoning.' He then cited the first 'advantage' of writing novels, which is that it is easier to stretch the word count. Essays, on the other hand, require some 'inspiration' to flow smoothly, making them difficult to write long.</p>
<p>Writing articles and paying attention to length, for the sake of a little compensation, resorting to forced stretching, turning a good, concise piece of writing into something where 'the dragon shows its head but not its tail'. A group of 'nearsighted' readers then praise it, saying, "Good article, look, it's written so long!" In this way, it is difficult to obtain truly excellent articles!</p>
<p>I would like to offer the eight words "speak long if you have something to say, speak short if you have nothing to say" to the writers of articles today!</p>

<h3>Hitler's British Girlfriend</h3>
<p>— Chen Shichao</p>
<p>In January of this year, newspapers published a piece of news saying that Hitler's British girlfriend, Miss Mitford, was injured by a gunshot and was carried home on a stretcher. This Nordic woman, considered ideal by Hitler, is the daughter of a British aristocrat, and since 1938, her name has frequently appeared in the headlines of newspapers.</p>
<p>From September to December 1939, her activities were extremely mysterious. At that time, she was in Germany. It wasn't until January of this year that newspapers reported that she was shot and carried back to London on a stretcher.</p>
<p>This aristocratic woman is twenty-five years old, tall, with golden hair and beautiful appearance. When Britain declared war on Germany on September 3 last year, she was trapped in Germany due to the disruption of transportation and could not leave the country. On October 20, a message came out saying that she was ill in a hospital in Munich and needed to undergo surgery. However, there was no detailed report on what illness she was suffering from.</p>
<p>Miss Mitford has been at the center of political storms for two years. However, her initial encounter with Hitler was long before this wave. It is said that one night in 1934, Hitler was dining in a restaurant in Munich when he saw Miss Mitford sitting at a table nearby.</p>
<p>Hitler asked one of his adjutants, "Who is this perfect Nordic woman?" The adjutant replied that she was British. Hitler immediately ordered that she be invited to join him, and from that moment on, Miss Mitford became an admirer of Hitler. Conversely, she also became one of the few girlfriends appreciated by Hitler.</p>
<p>Her support for Hitler and purism has encountered many reactions. In June 1938, she was arrested by the Czech authorities in Karlsbad on suspicion of espionage. Shortly before this incident, she had announced her intention to become a German citizen, which was probably the reason why she was not welcomed in Czechoslovakia. However, she was only detained for one day before being released.</p>
<p>On another occasion, in April 1938, she also suffered because of her support for Nazism. At that time, a mass rally in support of the Spanish Republican government was held in Hyde Park in London. Miss Mitford was wearing a swastika armband and was beaten by the protesting crowd. She was later rescued by the police and escaped danger.</p>
<p>Miss Mitford was born in 1914. Her father is the second Baron Redesdale and has six daughters in total. She is the fourth, and her name is Unity. One of her sisters is the wife of Sir Mosley, the leader of the British Fascist Party.</p>

<h3>Not Afraid of Criticism</h3>
<p>— Shi Ye</p>
<p>No one can avoid being criticized.</p>
<p>But some people are born with a 'thin skin' and are afraid of people's criticism. When criticized, pointed out, or scolded, they blush and become flustered; when they occasionally hear ugly remarks or attacks behind their backs, they become restless and feel ashamed to face others, even developing suicidal thoughts.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no need to be afraid of people's criticism. Criticism can be well-intentioned or malicious. We should humbly accept well-intentioned criticism and ignore malicious criticism. According to my daily experience, criticism behind people's backs is not well-intentioned, and it is even rumors, slanders, and smears. The meanness of such people's character can be imagined. Criticism behind people's backs is commonly called "speaking ill of someone," so the person who is most likely to speak ill of others must be a "bad person." Why be afraid of "bad people's" criticism?</p>
<p>We should adopt a correct attitude towards people's criticism. Whether it is advice, pointing out, attack, rumor, or smear, we should gather it all, objectively examine it, and then carefully conduct "self-criticism," thoroughly examining whether there are any errors or faults in all our words and deeds. If there are, we should admit them frankly and strive to correct and overcome them; if there are none, then there is no need to worry and remain calm. If the other party's criticism is malicious, then give a stern reply. If we can do this, we will not only not be afraid of people's criticism, but on the contrary, we will welcome it.</p>
<h3>Children's Group Marriage</h3>
<p>— Hai Feng</p>
<p>Recently, a group marriage was held in the northern Katiawar village of the Mumbai region of India. A total of 374 pairs of infants participated, making it the largest children's marriage ceremony in recent years. Many of the newlyweds were too young to walk and were brought by their parents, who arranged everything. The babies lay comfortably in their arms, giggling when they heard the cannon fire. Many of the grooms came in elaborately decorated bullock carts, and when they were brought before the monks, some were laughing and some were crying. Most of them had no idea what was going on. During the ceremony, the monks recited vows. After the ceremony, there was a joint banquet, and the parents also participated. The newlyweds ate very little, some running around, some snatching food, some playing, and the smallest were asleep. Due to the caste system and arranged marriages, child marriages are still practiced. In recent years, although the government has tried to prohibit it, it has not been very effective. A law was promulgated in 1935 stipulating the minimum marriage age as fourteen; a similar law was also enacted in 1934, stipulating the minimum age as thirteen. These laws are difficult to enforce because all classes in India have always permitted child marriages. According to a survey in 1921, there were 250,000 wives and widows in India under the age of five, and two million under the age of ten. It is estimated that about 40% of Indian women marry between the ages of ten and fifteen.</p>

<h3>Suggestions on National Films</h3>
<p>— Bao Fuxing</p>
<p>In recent years, perhaps because of the environment in Shanghai, most domestic films have gone down the path of "historical dramas," which was never considered before. Especially in the past year or two, "historical dramas" have simply dominated the world! In terms of historical dramas, almost all of them revolve around "women," which is certainly not right.</p>
<p>Moreover, even if the current and past historical dramas are carefully produced, they cannot eliminate their inherent shortcomings, because we are in daily contact with modern materials and modern spirit. Once we run into the cinema, our eyes are full of "antique charm." How can this be the "proper way"?</p>
<p>Therefore, from now on, in any case, we cannot let historical dramas dominate. In my personal opinion, the production of historical dramas should be relegated to a supporting role, and the main goal should be "modern films" with modern spirit and modern significance—or "era films" with the spirit and significance of the times. Everyone knows the difficulties of the environment, but "it is up to people to make things happen." The most important thing is willingness to work hard! Besides, it is much easier than historical dramas in terms of clothing, props, scenery, and scripts! For example, in "modern films," Guohua's "Seven Heavens" is very satisfactory.</p>
<p>At this time of soaring prices, the materials for "modern films" are even more "easy to pick up"; rice weevils, coal weevils, frozen ghosts, starving ghosts, the rampant of thieves, the increase in suicides, and even a part of the "bosses" in the education field, etc., should also be attacked and corrected! All of this is excellent material for drama! Moreover, the scope of film art is extremely broad. Literary films, science films, and social films can all be produced and are both popular and meaningful. Why not "shoot" them?</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope that the authorities of various domestic film companies can consider the actual situation, make improvements to the production policy, and make greater efforts to make domestic films more popular with the Chinese people!</p>
<h3>Wireless Movies Shown in Airplanes</h3>
<p>— Qing Hui</p>
<p>The American Paramount Company recently opened wireless movies in postal airplanes over Florida, and the results of the experiment were considered satisfactory. The machine used in this test is a Lowe brand standard projector, and all parts have been washed with chemicals to make them non-flammable to prevent accidents. The width of the screen is only six inches, suspended behind the pilot's office, occupying a very small space. According to American newspapers, the actions and dialogues in the film are no different from those usually shown. However, when the aircraft ascends and the speed increases suddenly, the figures on the screen are slightly distorted. The dialogue is also disturbed by the sound of the aircraft, but it can be restored in a moment, so it is not too much of an obstacle. Flying in the air is originally the most lonely, and in the future, wireless movies can be used for entertainment. Therefore, due to the success of this experiment, many believe that in the future, wireless movies will be shown in all long-distance passenger aircraft to relieve the loneliness of passengers.</p>
<h3>Kettle Studio Opera Talk: Anti-Erh Huang and Anti-Xi Pi</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>There are many names for Peking opera tunes, each with its own nature, meaning, and function. Today, we will talk about Anti-Erh Huang and Anti-Xi Pi. "Anti" means change. Both of these are changed tunes. Military strategists have both orthodox and unorthodox strategies, and music and songs have both orthodox and changed forms. This is the natural course of things. Erh Huang originated in the Yangtze River basin. Its sound is slow and harmonious, the same as the southern tunes of Kunqu opera. When it changes to Anti-Erh Huang, it is used to express sorrowful emotions, as exemplified by "The Cries of the Witch Ape in the Gorges."</p>
<p>Old male roles, such as "Bumping the Stele," "The Clay Pot Case," "Changing Sons at the Execution Ground," "Herding Sheep Circle," and "Chaisang Port"; young female roles, such as "Sacrificing at the Pagoda," "Sacrificing at the River," "Falling Flower Garden," "Cosmos Edge," and "Selling Pastries"; and young male roles, such as "Seeking Righteousness and Chastity" and "Small Display," all borrow the tune of Anti-Erh Huang to express infinite sorrow. Xi Pi is a branch of Qinqiang opera, produced in the mountains and fields. Its sound is high-pitched and intense. When changed to Anti-Xi Pi, it is specially used to sing out sorrowful emotions, which is perfectly embodied in "The Cries of the Cuckoo Bird in Blood." Anti-Xi Pi has no slow tempo, only two types: Er Liu (commonly called Er Liu) and San Ban. Old male roles have it. In "Lianying Stockade," Liu Bei cries for the deceased, singing Anti-Xi Pi Er Liu; in "Fish Gut Sword," Wu Zixu plays the Xiao flute in the Wu market, singing Anti-Xi Pi San Ban; and in "Visiting the Mother," bidding farewell to his wife and crying in the hall, also singing Anti-Xi Pi San Ban. However, in Anti-Xi Pi, whether it is Er Liu or San Ban, it must return to the orthodox tune of Xi Pi at the end, because Anti-Xi Pi is actually infringing on Erh Huang tune. If it goes without returning, it will become Erh Huang. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Fat and Thin</h3>
<p>— Seal</p>
<p>Fat to thin—eat less fat, do not eat rice, replace it with wheat food, eat more wild vegetables, wild fruits, beans, salt, and exercise more. Thin to fat—eat more fatty meats, eat lightly, often eat some sugar, drink a small amount of alcohol, do less strenuous exercise, and get enough sleep.</p>
<h3>Guohua Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Quan</p>
<p>Combining the wit of ancient and modern times in one place, performing both modern and historical dramas at the same time can be said to be Guohua's unique creation. "Li Amao and Dongfang Shuo" is this unprecedented attempt. Yesterday, Li Amao and Dongfang Shuo met in Nantiandou. One said, "Could the one who comes be Senior Dongfang Shuo?" and the other said, "Could the one who comes be Dr. Li Amao?" The opening line is already hilarious. In this segment, there are many new jokes, all of which are far-fetched. They are playing tricks in the clouds, and no one will see that it is the effect of the scenery, which shows the high skill of the art department.</p>
<p>The craftsmen were busy for three days, and only one scene was filmed. This is the champion parade in "The Love Story of Su San." Shu Shi plays Wang Jinlong, who won the top spot in the imperial examination and was ordered to parade through the streets. The drums and music were loud, and the scene was extremely grand. There were as many as 285 extras playing the audience and shopkeepers on both sides,衬托着堂皇富丽的排塲，眞是牡丹綠葉，相得益彰。</p>
