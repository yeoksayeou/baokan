<p>社評</p>
<h3>安定遠東在此一舉</h3>
<p>追悔雖是最苦痛的事，有時却有敎育價値；所貴乎追悔之後，幡然改圖，急起直追，不然追悔無益，抑且不可救藥。即如遠東問題，自一九三一年以還，各民治國始終未能對症下藥，以致步步落後，事事受挫，終於釀成破碎混亂的局面，這是各民治國今日所後悔的：吾人於「前事不忘後事之師」的信念下，爰於隔昨發爲「先定遠東」之議，期望英美加緊援助中國，首先肅淸遠東禍根，默察這幾天國際間的動態，深覺本報此一建議，不但合理，且已顯見此種可能的趨歸。在這東西兩處戰事隨時均可繼續擴大的今日。這或者正是時局發展的一個轉捩點，自有再加引伸之必要。</p>
<p>本來，近三數年來，全世界任伺抱有善良意願之人，莫不企望民治國之間，能夠團結一致，以合力制裁侵略勢力；一直到現在，敢說還有不少人在默禱中蘇英美四國合作的實現。及至德義日三國結了盟的，中英美三國的增進聯繫，已由許多行動見諸事實；日下所成爲疑問的，祗剩蘇聯一國，尤其是在莫洛托夫報聘柏林之日，全世界更紛傳着錯綜複雜的消息；其中傳播最甚的，就歐洲言，是說蘇聯行將進一步協助德義，以對抗英國：就亞洲言，便是說蘇日行將成立協定；更有聳人聽聞的，大意是說德義日蘇四國行將合力樹立世界新秩序，而其第一步驟將爲合力破壞小列顚帝國，以瓜分其屬地與勢力範圍。凡此云云，無疑地，都是起因於蘇聯立塲之迷離撲朔。</p>
<p>莫斯科外交之以冷酷的出實主義爲出發點，雖是盡人皆知；但克林姆宮當局的行動，有時仍不免令人感到莫測高深，這種現象，如果以哲學的眼光來看，或者可以說是因爲一般觀察者的根本立塲和蘇聯不同，所以很不容易捉摸莫斯科人士的心境。祗有一點，大可以認爲確定不移的，那就是：史丹林所領導之社會主義蘇維埃聯邦，在沒有受到直接侵略之前，是不願意捲入所謂「帝國主義戰爭」；非但不願捲入戰爭漩渦，甚至反而樂於旁觀世界列强的互相砍殺，以待他日遂行它的全世界社會主義革命計劃。這種看法，未必適合蘇聯眞意態，但是蘇聯自有招致這種嫌疑之處。根據這一觀點，再默察今日歐耶兩洲的大勢，不妨推論蘇聯今後對於東西兩處的戰爭，仍將保持着小同的態度。換句話說，對於歐戰，蘇聯或者因爲軍略上政治上經濟上乃至地理上的顧慮，不免賡續出以親德的中立態度。以幫助軸心國渡過目前對於英吉利希臘埃及三國戰事毫無生路的難關。對於遠東戰事，却絕對不會因爲德國的慫恿，便改弦易轍，拋了中國去和日本携手；即使它和日本成立互不侵犯協定，也不過如本報過去一再所論，暫不相犯，以聽任日本南進而已。此際關於歐戰部份。莫洛托夫究竟和德國當局有何決定，不在本篇評述範圍之內，姑不具論；關於遠東部份，蘇聯官方雖迄今尙無具體表示，但至少塔斯社在過去兩日之間，已經發出了兩决吾認：其一，對於一蘇日成立協定，以劃分遠東勢力範圍並由蘇聯同意中止援華一，加以吾認；其二，對於「日使建川曾邀蘇聯加入三國同盟，而以英屬印度交換西伯利亞東部」，加以吾認。於此可見不但外間所傳日蘇之間行將合作云云，不盡可信，抑且日本假使悍然南進，更無理由相信蘇聯能爲之助；這就是說，英美今後果在遠東採取强硬行動，德義旣因自顧不暇和鞭長莫及而無法助日，蘇聯更未必改變一貫的政策，以打擊中國的同志。準此而論，中英美三國如果決定共同解決遠東亂源，蘇聯即使不積極參加、至少是小會從中作梗的；因此這件重大任務的實踐，完全將視中英美三國的決心和努力；其間車慶政府的堅決抗戰，是絕無疑問的，最近華軍在各路前綫的節節勝利，以及粵西桂南日軍的紛紛潰退，正是中國愈戰愈勇愈戰愈强的明證。以英國言，遠東軍區的設立，確是一個車大措置，華盛頓方面甚至有英國可派主力艦五艘至新嘉坡的觀察，這或者就是英美海軍在南太平洋與印度洋合作的先聲。至於美國呢，除增防菲島外，諾克斯海長更於一昨發表驚人的言論，明言「美國應以援助英國的恣態援助中國」；再證諸中國空軍司令毛邦初將軍之赴美接洽物費援助問題，以及泛美航空公司之計劃伸展航綫至香港新嘉坡，可見今後美國確將如本報日前之所建議，考慮對華作進一步之援助。當此東京作盡種種南進恣態。日軍在西貢登陸消息頻傳之際，英美態度的積極化，確是「懲前毖後」。挽救過去種種失策的最後關頭，殷願英美政家自羅斯福邱吉爾以次，千萬不要再蹈過去的覆轍。</p>

<h3>歐戰痛史（三）　法國悲劇中三主角　（一）外強中乾的達拉第</h3>
<p>我又說：「由你親自寫封信，並不出諸他人之手，——比王一定覺得欣慰，因而產生良好的印象。在這非常環境中，我將親自奉遞此書。去年他曾囑我辦過事，你當然還能記得。這種做法一定能使他感奮。凡百事情我們總要如此去做纔好。」</p>
<p>我們握手道別時，達拉第回答說：「我對你說，讓我再考慮一下。我將以最後決定通知考朗達。（代理外交部長）。明天你可到外交部看他</p>
<p>第二天，考朗達對我說道：「總理還未定奪。他說，我們不必急急。他親口說一讓他們（指比利時）再煎熬一歇罷」</p>
<p>我倒不能把此事就此了結。所冒的危險實然太大了。我旣不能用正面攻擊法獲得達拉第的允許，只好另用包圍戰術了。我依决往訪司法部長龐納，敎育部長台爾博斯老友，財政部長萊諾。</p>
<p>他們幾乎衆口一詞的道：「這分明是件非常重要之事，如此叫比王等待着，實屬不近情理。我們如能再和達拉第講講，當然最好，不過看上去很爲費事。在他沒有對我們說明之前，他極不願實我們去問他像這樣的事情。你爲什麽不去看看他的親信，譬如說，像克拉比愛（達拉第機要秘書）呢」</p>
<p>我就往訪克拉比愛。他很了解我的來意，允爲幫忙。但是直到三個月之後，我纔返回白魯塞爾，而比王則始終沒有接獲達拉第的信。</p>
<p>達拉第在戰事期中的作風，我尙能多所描寫。不過對於我剛才所述的一件事無關宏旨，就此從略罷。</p>
<p>現在我們可以問：「他爲政的基本價値何在？他巳成了怎樣一種人？」</p>
<p>在實際上，他已成爲一個獨裁者了。總攬了獨裁者一切大權，但毫無建樹可言。他在精神上，還是個民治主義者。我深信他之所以採取獨裁制者，由於環境使然，而爲一時權宜之計。他盼望着法國勝利之日，能在國會中向衆宣佈道：「現在，法蘭西共和國，和人道自由的勝利，終於達到了。我引以爲榮，已往的一切所爲，想來諸公都感覺滿意罷。現在我要退休了。」</p>
<p>對呀，他是一個獨裁者，但是第一他因禀性上的缺陷，勞而無功。他還未完擺脫二月六日（巴黎暴動事件）時的畏縮態度，雖然有許多地方，碰到劇變之時，巳知如何强自振作之方。他自已弄得有些半麻木的樣子，遇事一而再，再而三的深思潛想，延宕躭誤，遲疑不決。而最感不去的，他名爲獨裁者，在良心上却還是受民洽主義的驅使。這當然是他的光明之處，自不得加以提及。由因循的民主政治機構所產生的種種反抗，叢集其身，他一籌莫展，無法予以解脫。一方面又不能戰勝習俗上的惰性和各種短處。他之所以缺乏能力，不能與眞正獨裁者相提並論者，實緣於他一巳自由人民的天良未泯，不敢驅使自由人民作爲獨夫的工具。</p>
<p>可惜他做眞獨裁者的能力雖不足，而在不知不覺之間，一切獨裁者的惡習氣倒都學會了。對於別人總很懷疑，喜歡孤獨，總覺得自己是對的，天下一切事他沒有不明白的。凡是個性堅强，而能直指其面，敢說：「你錯了」的，他最嫌惡</p>
<p>最嚴重而令人無法解答的，當爲下面的一個問題：「他對於這次戰爭如何看法？是不是因爲他看不準的緣故，而冒險爲之麼」？</p>
<p>其中的一部份是神秘，難於解答的。但是我想在許多神秘之中，也能我出一個答案來，作爲局部的解釋呢。</p>
<p>達拉第有生以來，最痛恨戰爭。上决大戰時他以小兵資格入伍打仗。他政治見解中有一個不可動搖的意念，那就是：我們不能再像上决那樣的使國家與人交戰。我們對於弭戰之方，總較前人爲高明。倘然結果還是使國家發生戰事，那末這一定因爲他們沒有像我們那樣的澈底痛恨戰爭的緣故。</p>
<p>直到一九三九年三月十五日爲止，他還是相信自己能善爲處理一切。這就是他對慕尼克會議不表示異議的緣由。後來因爲我們的　人，明　的將不惜一切犧牲，以求一戰，他才漸漸的明白，他巳沒有弭戰之術了。但事至當時，他還對於飄渺的希望，執迷不悟，以爲在最後的一瞬間，還有奇蹟來臨呢。</p>
<p>當戰事爆發之後，我敢祖保其心理中必有如下的概念，一眞不講理，然而有誰知呢？也許遷延時日，敵人終於失敗。我們可從敵人的內部革命，或其疲於奔命，經濟或民氣崩潰時，將德國擊敗。在不必多流血，甚至不要流血之下，使全世界冉能領略自由空氣」。</p>
<p>以道種心理來應付戰事，成敗可知。我把它回全世界的民主國家，和愛好自由和平的朋友宣佈，心中猶有餘痛呢。</p>
<p>也許你可以說：「這種說法，對於達拉第担任國防部部長的多年任期中，爲什麼不製迭些飛機戰車的理由，仍舊沒有解釋淸楚。在戰事發生後六個月中，他對於訓練軍隊，促進軍火製造，及以波蘭及芬蘭被侵略的事實，作爲藍本的近世國防策路等，一件也不去做，溺職之咎，實無可貸」。</p>
<p>當然，他難逃其咎。他在這時期中縱飲成習，亦非無因。人家都說他，他爲刺激氣力起見，常常吃酒，而且所吃的酒，愈弄愈强。這也許是事實，但是我想起來，這未必是個致命的原因。</p>
<p>還有人說他玩女人——尤其他和克羅莎爾士侯爵夫人的繾綣。我恐怕達拉第在此女人身上所浪費的時間和精神實在太多了。一九二六年時，達拉第和我在法蘭西話劇院中笑談關於女優的香豔情事，早已付諸東流。我所認爲更可惜的，像這樣一位來自奧倫治的麵包師之子，竟因和侯爵夫人發生曖眛，而情甘做勢利塲中的俘處。在如此情狀之下，達拉第簡直自暤共短，授人以隙，曷勝浩嘆。但是我看起來，這倒也還在其次。</p>
<p>我想，女人和將軍們比起來，輕　懸殊，立刻可以判分。達拉第一度曾爲人民陣綫領袖之一，曾極端反對戰爭反對軍閥的，却漸漸的變爲軍人們的忠僕了。他在失敗怨忿之餘，竟把自己禁閉在枯廟似的陸軍部中，在那里朝夕接觸的，多是些糾糾武夫，他所聽到的完全是軍官們的口吻。他覺得他們和順可愛，不像輿論的要指摘他，這些軍官們的聲音，都是很有份寸，謹愼小心，甚至諂媚動人，字裏語問，處處表示着恭敬，渴慕和仰愛的心，達拉第竟爲他們麻醉了（完）</p>

<p>洋米昨日升降不一、然以買多於賣、市價繼見上升、以存底來源定貨及實銷而論、昨市例須回落、乃米市早在投機氣氛中、全　囤戶及米蠹所操縱、當上午早市尙居平平、因隔昨午後再度高漲後、人心未免顧忌、手中所有獲利之貨、多思乘高出籠、故當時形成出多進少、各價步落元砠、孰料經此貶短、一霎那間、一般客囤米蠹又乘機活躍、一時形勢復轉活絡、不知底蘊之浮戶、羣相附和、一味盲從跟進、於是市面反疲還緊、行情節節回升、市面越踢越高、上午收市已大一元之譜、午後續漲七八角、及晚收則又回平五六八角、結果仍比前晚漲起兀外、但有一部份現米祇稍大三五角、市面混沌頗不一律、如紅實塔二號米早開六十九元、小至六十八元六角、漸又漲至六十九元半收市、午後一度漲達七十元零二角、收市六十九元七八角、ＫＧ脾上午六十七八元、下午六十八元八角、收市仍祗六十八元、回籠一號西貢現貨八十六元八角、特高八十八元半、十一月八十二元半、十二月八十一元、又二號現八十三元半、十一月份上午七十八元半至八十元、下午至七十元零九角收市七十元零五角、十二月份上七十六元三角至七十七元、下午大至七十八元、收市又降小三五角、而乏受主、市價起伏不一、完全是搗把行爲、但貨主抬價之定貨問題、又因續有成交而予以反證、新成交計有日興行拋出卽裝小絞一千噸、價七十五元八角、全日　米成交萬餘包、回籠原包亦有千外噸、</p>
<p>至於評價一事、儘管向報章作種種紙面宜傳、無如說可如此說、做則不如此做、據傳說米價非漲至相當合於米商客囤所期望之價格後、不欲有所舉動、故米市之紊亂、實由於此、而米價之牛準、河淸難望、至於加百分之若干利息一節、設照目前進價以爲計算、則米商囤戶所獲之利息、優厚不可以數計、蓋所優爲者、正是善放烟幕謠言、欺世盜名、攫取非常之大和耳、</p>
<p>新粳尖及菉種野稻等到貨相繼仍有千餘石、而店銷猶暢、故市面一再增高、昨開新粳原包九十三元、九十元、斛見八十九元半、八十七元、野稻九十三元、九十元、菉種原包九十元、斛見八十七元、杜尖斛見七十七八元、</p>
<p>糯米香港貨有千餘包抵埠、本糯祗一些存貨應市、故本糯市勢較佳、續升元許、洋糯不過如是、計開宜溧白元八十四元、常丹白元八十二三元、香港元七十六元至七十四元、糯茶特自六十六元决至六十四元、</p>
<p>苞米前目西實等地運來者、爲數無多、本埠所銷有限、昨日有一千包運威海衛、二千包運烟台、</p>
<h3>新到洋粉　已有做開</h3>
<p>現粉昨日市况、平庸如故、查一號粉廠盤仍爲十七元、及客盤十八元五角、一時尙未變動、計由福阜兩廠批出老車福新牌粉八千餘包、前日新到之洋粉、亦巳做開、計由本客辦去三千餘包、因該貨品質並不過高、價在開十八元五角至七角之間、聞續批定粉絡繹而至、故市面難以望好、回籠貨本洋粉交易俱靜、暫乏成議、</p>
<p>小麥市况、依然供求兩稀、蓋以市十存到兩少、尤以租界存棧貨更爲稀寥、售價須二十六七元、聞最近絡繹到貨、均係直接解廠、故市塲交易、仍在靜默中、</p>
<h3>金融述評　—十一月十六日—　日銀發行的將來　聖凱瓊</h3>
<p>七月份金融述評日系通貨的膨脹，會劇本年六月底日本三大銀行紙幣與日系的通貨，說明它的膨脹情形。直到最近日系通貨發行數字在九月底的尙難收集齊全，且留待將來再加分析。但最近從束京方面傳來兩種消息，合併起來一加研究，可見日本銀行紙幣發行正在走向可怕的極端的惡性膨脹之途，正不必就整個的日系通貨情形去探求。</p>
<p>首先所要介紹的，就是日本銀行紙幣發行額，按若干時來均在三十三萬萬日元上下盤　，今年九月間仍是三十三萬三百萬日元，十月一日竟增至三十五萬七十九百萬日元，十一日减爲三十四萬三千六百萬日元，但至月底又增加至三十七萬五千三百萬日元，造成日本財政史上最高的紀綠。木月的發行額雖未可知，但依這個織减易增的趨勢看來，倘賡續不變，則大有再度打破紀錄的可能。</p>
<p>其次是日本銀行總裁結城氏在全國金融討論會上，由於黃金問題所發表演說稱：用爲國內通貨的基礎底黃金職能，已經失去它的重要性，而用爲國際收支淸算手段底黃金職能，今後由於內外情勢的推移，益爲增加它的重要性。一般的主張，以爲應冉行檢討日銀兌換券的發行制度，卽日銀券的發行額今後在年末勢將更形增加它的膨脹率，以故一般的主張，爲使採用最高發行制度以及其他的可能的通貨管理，必須根本改革發行制度。而自世界主要國家放棄金本位，以致斯絕黃金與物價關係的結果，日銀的準備，致被人視爲在國內巳非重要，金準備的一部份甚或全部實可滾存於滙兌基金，以謀滙兌賣金的擴充。今後將以此爲目標而進行兌換條令的改正和發行制度的改革云。</p>
<p>日銀的惡性膨脹旣已證明其爲事實，同時日銀總裁也深知今年末的必然會極端的走向惡性之途，於是想在這納粹黨人聲稱黃金無用之時，對發行制度加以根本改革，而將是否確實的現金發行準備移用於滬兌資金上去。將這可疑的値五萬萬日元的黃余準備移用於滙兌資金，在外滙與貿易上講起來，對於日本外滙頭襯缺乏和增加軍需材料購買力，從强化侵略行動的意義上講，當然是有利的。不過如何用　高將行制度以及其他的可能的通貨管理，以根本改革發行制度，確値得檢討的。（未完）</p>

<h3>滙市受謠諑支配</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、滙豊掛牌、悉無上落、英美匯暗市、遽又走緊、趨勢不定、雖經營者、亦難揣測、半日經過、晨初先因投機家廣幫叉塞出美金十數萬元、致五元九六八七五、又一度難賣可結、英滙銀行曾互做三便士八一二五、時外商各行出入均稀、僅有利扒英金叶出印滙、距至十一點一刻、市傳某方對某法院叉有企圖及發行金庫券種種無稽謠諑於是人心認爲消自利多、止塞而扒、允以港電投機商最力、結果午收英金吿三便士七五、美匯五元八七五、比上日英緊〇三一二五、美軟〇六二五、</p>

<h3>與匯市受同樣影響　金價重振　衡出五千七百元關</h3>
<p>昨烚赤金市暗盤、初仍平疲、午刻突轉漲、價於雙重謠風中、已衝出五千七百元大關外、外匯報緊、各方人心激昂、自晨初開頗平、爲五千六百五十元、因外滙微鬆、小錢莊補空雖切、銀號出籠甚殷、曾盤小至五千六百四十元、直至十一點一刻、更謠及金庫券並法院問題、外滙在投機扒風中趨緊、激起買風、滙票商復進、金號爭買、步昂見五千七百十元、終爲五千七百零八元、回漲五十八元、半日交易共的四千兩、下午週六無市、現金比期交價的低近十元、掉期買方貼出予賣方、由十三元做低至十元、飾金升十元、達五百九十元、關金等均平云、</p>
<p>烚赤漲五十八元</p>
<p>晨初以滙市開出、穩中帶硬、金價難起、銀號商出證券幫一十兩、爲五千六百五十元、金號再施壓力、塞予證券幫三十兩、吿五千六百四十五元、時錢兌業起撈、價稍回好、計錢兌業進金號二十兩、爲五千六百七十九元、後證券幫銀號傾向吐售、重猛落至五千六百四十元、惟因外滙漸見軟化、兼有利多空氣散播、金號銀號等猛搜、不久出五千七百元關外、計金號入證券幫二十兩、爲五千七百零五元、金號進銀號三十兩、吿五千七百元、最高價銀號曾對做見五千七百十元、午收結果、錢兌業出銀號二十兩、爲五千七百零八元、比隔昨軋升五十八元、半日七十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金赤掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出價、大同行與新同行初仍掛五百八十元、正午升十元、計五百九十元、收進减三十元云、</p>
<h3>外幣步高</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、在種種流言下、步趨漲勢、英美金鎊因亦各升二元、英金票仍鮮進出、市價依然呆定、美金票始曾退至十六元四角三分、旋因謠傳關於流通券之說甚熾、以致黑市美滙頓緊、美票於午後曾高至七角半、卒爲十六元七角比上日軋升二角半香港票終漲三分、日金票始漲繼落、晚市爲一元五角三分、朝鮮票呆定如故、　市仍爲一元一角八分、</p>

<p>此决銀行　减低活期存息、原望其酌川定期利息、化存爲定、以便內地建設之運用、而無如各銀行之减息、乃多栘作營業費用、如加給行員之津貼、其一也、故各工商業職工雖亦有津貼之發給、皆無如銀行職員之優厚、各銀行加給行員津貼辦法、有照工部局生活指數、依照薪額、發給津貼者、亦有按照在滬家屬人數多寡、發給米貼或煤貼或房貼者、聞銀行業中某團體、擬向各行徵集津貼辦法、籌訂統一辦法、以供各行參考、每見銀行行員、對於顧客往往顧指氣使、而不念所衣食者皆間接出之於顧客也、（壽）</p>

<h3>油市實銷清淡</h3>
<p>昨日油市因乏新刺激、致滬勢淸閒行情除遠期生油被投機商拉緊元許外、其餘均屬平庸、無甚變遷、豆油買賣兩淡、昨共成交膠州豆油五十件價爲七十六元、大連豆油三十桶、一百十一元、膠州生油二百件、七十四元一一角半、至七十四元五角、靑島生油五十桶、一百零三元五角、十一月下交二百桶、一百零三元至一百零三元五角、十二月下交八百桶、一百零四元二角半至一百零五元七角半、烟台聽生油二百聽、一百零六元、</p>
<p>證劵</p>
<h3>實貨有流出　公債不易抬頭</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨市兩度抬高、依然疲落、市上又有發行金庫券之說、但市塲看漲看跌、顯分兩派、見仁見智、各有理由、觀市塲趨勢、大戶不斷賣出，銀行亦有現貨流出、各情形觀察、市價殊不易抬頭、但買進方面亦頗具相當勢力、未可厚非、此種金融上之變化、在米曾正式發表前、恐將一度趨於混沌、昨日上午順昌繼續買進十餘萬、聯益同順買進亦有相當胃量、丙種市價曾再達一元六角行市、但同康賣出仍有餘與、協大怡泰亦有出籠、市價緩緩低落、反較隔日爲小、惟甲種堅挺、午後有厚大買進二十餘萬、鴻大買進亦不少、餘如永康聯益及三十五號均有買進、但以同康仍有大量賣出、同順聯和脫手亦極湧、市價竟吿不支而疲、結果除甲種尙略漲五分外、餘均回小一角至三角、成交的計一百七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>紗花</p>
<h3>原料來源未解決　紗廠不遠開售　雙馬昨回漲廿元</h3>
<p>紗市轉趨上升、目漲風亦熾、此因香港幫對於現紗需要繼續不懈、而二十支雙馬亦有購買、因之人心振作、一般拋空之戶、鑒於環境好轉、活動抵補、市盤乃逐步前進、又有人說、廠方何以不開售、實則原料不能爽爽快快的解決、所以一時不得出售也、昨有棉紗一千六百二十五件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣溫和、上日午後巳轉好面、因之市塲上賣者已見缺乏、二十支雙馬首盤價爲一千二百四十五元、同時外棉上升、做多吸收之輩較夥、頃刻間漲至一千二百五十五元、旋以外匯開出寗靜、獲利略有吐出、又復回挫幾元、在一千二百四十七八元之間返往、爲時甚久、繼聞廣帮實銷不弱、又見上升、漲至一千二百六上二元收盤、查半日間成交統計六千〇七十包、行情一十支雙馬漲二十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左香港一、一七〇同行四、九〇〇</p>
<p>午後雙馬紗人心殊佳、據云紗布交易所中做到一千二百六十六元、</p>
<h3>棉花僵局難開</h3>
<p>現棉情形良好、近日廠方需耍、未曾發展、所以人心和善、不過外棉漲風續見、至於本棉、各路來源仍未十分暢通、目前棉市大勢仍在僵持中、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、日來殊形活躍、先因投機者之購買、後因同業之搜求、結果收盤價格、較之上日叉漲十四五磅音、印度連同預測亦漲三羅比餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來始終靜寂異常、各方俱抱觀望態度、廠方暫時無意購買、同業則終以外棉來源之不易、故不願廉價出售、因之雙方俱無交易、</p>
<p>疋頭</p>
<h3>棉布交易活躍</h3>
<p>廠布昨市、晨開平平、午後軒堅、木街同業及門市交易情形活動、售幣棉布、粗布平平、細布、斜紋漲二角半之續、色布。漂布亦少軒輊、廠盤較手貨每疋昂五角至一元、本街成交坯布。絨布。漂染布八百餘件、粵港幫辦組布。色布。漂布一百餘件、浙路溫甬幫辦色布。色斜。漂布等二百餘件、國外暹邏。星加坡等地辦色布。漂布五六千疋、十六日有疋頭一千四百十件運香港、</p>
<p>東疋市氣轉堅、白貨龍頭細布上午收盤三十五元七角半、嗶嘰一元零九分二釐半、下午因過六無市、而同行暗盤交易、則又升騰、細布如龍頭有做開三十六元、四君子嗶嘰二元一角、情勢趨昂、</p>

<p>五金</p>
<h3>安的目尼　一再升騰</h3>
<p>安的目尼（卽國產純銻之俗種）、昨日市面通常秀俏、因本者存底不多、且港地來源赤不湧旺、故同業居奇之念、由是而生、標準一高再高、昨市每噸巳喊八千六百元、比前父漲二三百元不等、然實銷反因漲風鋒銳、而吿閑散、市塲僅有問訊及報價而已、</p>

<h3>美第三艘撤僑專輪　華盛頓號今抵滬　該輪噸位雖巨但將進口　預定廿日下午載僑離此</h3>
<p>美政府勸吿遠東僑民撒退、並指派專輪載運、其第一二兩艘、馬滬公司蒙德萊號。瑪利波匯號。兩輪、業巳先後由滬載運僑民回國、各情迭誌本報、第三專輪華盛頓號郵船、昨據美國總統輪船公司宣稱、準於今日下午三時抵埠、該輪噸位雖鉅、但將駛入浦江、預定停泊十一十二號浮筒、船員登陸小輪、的今日下午四時半至新關碼頭、此决離滬者、的九百人、該輪在滬的有三日停泊、定二十日下午二時離滬赴菲、本市撤退美僑登輪、規定二十日上午九時十一時、及中午十二時三决小輪、由新關碼頭開往、美國總統輪公司爲便利回國僑民起見、今日照常辦公、調換正式船票、</p>
<p>美僑婦女不勝依依</p>
<p>關於尙有多數美僑之撤退問題據記者調查所悉、現每一家庭中、頗多意見相左者、一般男子爲其妻子兒女之安全起見、大多願將眷屬遺送回美、但多數婦女、則又不願任具良人單獨在華、故臨行每多依依不捨之意、此外、尚有多數婦女來華數載、方覓得一棲枝之所、一旦撒退、又將喪失其所有之職業、且有大多數人不知將來時局平靜後、政府是吾將資叻彼等返華也、</p>
<p>請援助者在調查中</p>
<p>據美總領事署聯員稱、關於申請救濟援助之美僑七人、仍在繼續調查中、據稱、其中二人、已調查元華、連同眷屬、共計五人、將由政府協助、於下月或明年初乘輪返國、又據該署某一職員稱、吾人對於此輩申請人、將儘速辦理、但不能使其更先於通常之旅客、</p>
<p>教士去留頗感兩難</p>
<p>自華盛頓國務院發表通告、觀令遠東美僑撒退回國以來、全中國美籍敎士、對此撒退問題、頗有進退兩難之感、蓋在華美敎士之工作、均爲信仰基督之終生服務、同時對於美政府之勸吿、亦不能充耳不聞、故美敎士之撒退與吾、不僅個人之問題面巳、且美敎士若果大批撤退回國、則東方許多信奉耶穌之基督徒、其信心勢必發生動搖、同時美國國內基督敎徒、其中頗多捐助經費、使敎士等得在海外傳道、今敎士等若一日撤退、自必引起捐助人之灰心、某敎會醫師已無法獲得醫藥需用品之接濟、蓋因渠須將此項醫藥品、由淪陷區運至自由中國、但渠之職業爲敎會醫師、否則儘可撒退回美也、</p>
<p>郵船代表協助疏散</p>
<p>遠東美僑民奉令撒退後、美國郵船公司奉派來遠東指示之代表戈登（Royal　Gordon）魯賓遜（Hugh　Robinson）及華爾（Wallen　Well）三人、業於十日由舊金山起程搭聯美航空公司容機一檀香山號」「飛剪」號飛抵香港、協助疏散遠東僑民、叉戈登氏抵馬尼刺、曾赴馬尼刺酒店、謁見美遠東艦隊總司令赫德上將、奉商一切、</p>
<h3>明日起　安全週　全市一體注意　共維交通秩序</h3>
<p>本埠兩租界警務當局、鑒於去年推行「安全第一」運動、成績卓著、爲更促進人民注意交通規則、减少車輛肇禍起見、特聯合自明日起、推行第二次「安全第一」運動、各項辦法、已誌前報、據車務處負責人談、上年推行安全運動後、喪命車下者其數大减、此次再度推行、成績自必較前决爲佳、但事關公益、希望全市人民、不但於安全運動期內、特別負起鼓吹宣傳之責任、卽在期後、一方面自身注意行路規則、另一方面亦須敦促親友鄰居謹愼從事、則不但無辜喪生者可以减少、卽社會秩序、亦得因此進步也、</p>
<h3>昨又有日軍被槍擊　虹口形勢嚴重　開槍者逃逸華人中流彈　日方攔截交通大事搜索　昨夜與今晨兩處日軍槍擊華人</h3>
<p>邇來虹口日方警戒區內、迭次發生日軍官被殺血案、迄至前日、已達十决之多，詎昨日午後、虹口區域內、又發生一日軍被狙擊事件、當被射中一彈、傷勢沉重、其時有目擊其事之日軍官圖逮捕行刦者、乃　再開一槍、未敢近前、卒被逸去無踪、出事後、日方又嚴密戒備、大施搜查、居民備極騷擾之苦、茲將各情分誌於后、</p>
<p>日方軍曹又遭狙擊</p>
<p>昨日下午十二時四十五分許、有一日軍曹名富永貢者、在虹口吳淞路一帶聞步、」行抵吳淞路蓬路二九五號日本居留民會俱樂部門前時、突有人在其背後開槍狙擊、該富永貢中一彈卽應聲倒地、行刺者見目的已達、卽折入蓬路某小弄內逃逸、當時有日本商店之職員、目擊其事、亟步追入弄、欲將其逮捕、然未及數步、行刦者返身再開一槍、該職員畏縮、未敢近前、惟有任其逸去、一面將受傷者送入附近篠崎醫院醫治、當行刺者返擊一槍時、有一華人、會被流彈擦傷、亦併送院醫治、</p>
<p>封鎖橋樑交通斷絕</p>
<p>事後日方立將外白渡橋。四川路橋。及北江西路以西各馬路、加以封鎖、一面在出事地點挨戶搜查、並有海軍陸戰隊及憲兵分隊巡邏北江西路。天潼路。七浦路。文監師路。海寗路靶子路。轉角、均有日本海軍陸戰隊荷槍駐守、界路北火車站、亦暫時斷絕交通、公共租界警務處聞訊後、亦驅派大批武裝中西探捕、馳往外白渡橋。四川路橋。江西路橋等處、維持秩序、</p>
<p>多人被阻無法通行</p>
<p>日方於一時實施戒備後、該區域交通、完全斷絕、雖日人要求通過、亦未獲通融、當時往郵政總局投遞信函者、被阻不能出外、郵政總局各辦事人員、亦遭阻擋、一時鵠立於橋樑者、不下五百人、界內或界外之中西幼童放學後、均不得歸家、佇立於鐵絲網外、啼笑皆非、至搭滬杭火車來滬者、均在車站席地而坐、欲往火車站乘車者、紛携行李折返、直至叫時許、日方始將海寗路。北江西路。開放一缺口僅許住民出入、一切車輛均被阻止、檢查允爲苛細、而其餘各處、入晚猶未徹除戒備、</p>
<p>外白渡橋入晚開放</p>
<p>迄至晚間八時四十分許、外白渡橋始開放通行、行人及車輛司由百老匯路華德路暢行無阻惟吳淞路三角小菜　及漢壁禮路一帶、仍交通阻塞、以故乍浦路橋滬、駐有男女行人數百名、羣欲要求開放過橋、</p>
<p>乍浦路橋日軍開槍</p>
<p>駐於乍浦橋堍之日軍陸戰隊維持秩序、竟開槍數響、有一華人命中路地、傷勢沉重、後經日方用軍用車裝載他去、不知所終、中央救火會聞訊後、亟驅救護車趕往、奈駛至吳淞路、卽遭日方阻止前進、旋卽折回、至受傷之一華人是吾傷亡及運往何處、均無法探明、</p>
<p>工人聞眺又遭槍擊</p>
<p>今晨零點三十分許、有在靶子場爲小工之張小道（年三十二歲通州人）、在裏白渡橋下境閒眺時、又被日軍開放一槍、命中左腰部、傷勢沉重、嗣召救護車到塲、載送同仁醫院療治、</p>
<h3>錢業公會通過　週六下午休假</h3>

<h3>日僑競選工董計劃　成功希望絕妙　上海前途緊於美日談判　變更選舉法係一種試探</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（十五日）據消息靈通人士聲稱、上海日本居留民協會擬在下屆公共租界納稅人大會舉行之前、更變工部局董事選舉規則、以利日方、此種希圖、旣無重大關係、亦乏成功可能、蓋影響上海前送之眞正問題、刻由華盛頓與東京雙方循外交途徑解決之也、</p>
<p>雖加準備猶多顧慮</p>
<p>自本年四月間舉行劇烈之董事競選以還、迄今巳歷七閱月、而距下屆選舉、猶有五月、日人刻正注視外交發展、英美集團、亦留　於日人、待其有所行動、而後始組織選舉委員會、蓋日人方面或將決定、如藉選舉方法對公共租界實施「閃電戰」、將引起美國之敵對、而日人固不願美日關係趨惡化也、</p>
<p>目前對此尚守沉默</p>
<p>來歲四月間，日人苟不存奢望、而以現有之日董兩席爲滿足、則選舉根本不必舉行、今料雙方對競選問題、將守緘默、去年間主要英僑、早於六月份卽着手開闢競選得達最後勝利之途徑、以本年言、則日人競選失敗後、雖曾揚言立卽準備以謀明年四月間競選時東山再起、惟日人與英美兩集團迄今絕少或竟無所準備、</p>
<p>英僑實力足以制勝</p>
<p>傳若干日商已在公共租界購置地英房屋、以增加其選舉實力然倒僑集團、實力强勁、當能壓皮此種挑戰、所傳日本居留民協會希圖更變選舉法、實可視爲日人試探其在此方面能獲何種成就、此點多視東京對於「新秩序」程序、能進行至何種程度而定、</p>

<h3>各公團對電話加價　將有表示　根本無加價必要　法公董局應糾正</h3>
<p>自當局暫定電話加價三原則後、全市驚異、僉以上海電話公司戰後營業發達、　根本無加價必要、今乃企圖實現鉅額加價、倘此項辦法果見實行、則加價數目不啻將達兩倍、竟創其他公用事業加價之紀錄、其足以妨害工商營業、極爲顯見、現各方均盼法公董局對此項不台理之加價、尙能予以糾正、並聞界內各公團對於此事、亦深致關懷、將有嚴正之表示、</p>
<h3>抗議大生輪被扣　美領仍待答復　日方正在研究抗議內容　傳義輪赤被阻松門港外</h3>

<h3>融五社四屆講經　演繹精進要義　依佛敎經論分四項申述</h3>
<p>融五講經社四屆講經、由謝頌三牧師演講『耶敎與儒敎之同點、」其講詞已見昨日本報、謝牧帥講畢後、决卽由楊中一君講儒釋相同之點第四、亦卽六波羅密之四、復决曰昆黎耶波羅昆雜密，華言精進、謂由勇猛勇修而無退轉、卽是鷄鳴而起、孳孳爲善、乃至不舍晝夜、力行無怠之勤勉心、依佛敎經論、復分四項說之、</p>
<p>勤怠之分</p>
<p>菩薩本行經叙佛吿阿難言、一懈怠者、衆行之累、居家懈怠、則衣食小供、產業不舉、出家懈怠、則不能離生死之苦、一切衆事、皆由精進興、在家精進、衣食豐饒、居業益廣、出家精進、道行皆成、直至成佛、皆由精進而得成辦、」精進不退、直至成佛、此力行不倦、「人皆可以爲堯舜也、」嗟夫、「業精於勤荒於嬉、」是故勤儉起家、憂勞興國、宴安酖毒、逸豫亡身、「譬如爲山、未成」簧、止吾止也、譬如平地、雖覆一簧、進吾往也、勤怠之分、有如是者、</p>
<p>勤勉之理</p>
<p>晋竺法獲譯修行道地經、「佛云、自見宿命、徒無量劫往反生死、沒積身骨、過須彌山、其髓塗地、可徧天下三千世界、其血流墮、多於古今普雨、但欲免斯生死之患、晝夜精進、求於無爲、」「夫子之曾、性與天道、不可得而聞也、」大過之難聞如是、有有聞焉、「朝聞道、夕死可也、」聞道之可喜又如是、故聞斯行之、」子路有聞、未之能行、惟恐有聞、」道豈可徒聞、重在力行、近乎仁、「爲仁由己、」「我欲仁斯仁至矣」、故曰、「任重而道遠、仁以爲己任、不亦重乎，死而後已、，不亦遠乎、」故「君子無終食之問遠仁、」若信道不篤、半途而廢、孔子斥之曰、「今汝畫、」故必篤志好學、守死善道、」勉之哉、勉之哉、「語之而不惰哉、」顏淵之「欲罷不能、」故「見其進而未見其近也、」</p>
<p>勤勉之念</p>
<p>大實種經說、「精進有十念、菩薩如是思淮十念、三實功德、專念不亂、是名正念精進」「淮狂克念作聖、」念之不可巳如是夫、故曰、「念茲在茲、」「中心藏之、佝日忘之、」思之思之、又重思之、「思之弗得弗措也、」非曰鬼神通之也、吾心之明德自昭也、</p>
<p>勤勉之法</p>
<p>唐般若三藏釋大乘理趣六波羅密多經、說「有四種精進、具足智慧、何等爲四、一動於多聞、二勤於總持、三勤於樂說、四勤於正行、」案勤勉首在多聞、「多聞擇其善者而從之、見多而識之、」多聞愼言、多見愼行、「乃多聞益矣」、次耍能總持「專心一志、」「至死不變、」「擇乎中庸得一善、則拳拳服膺而弗失之矣、」「得見有恒者斯可矣、」故「君子遵道而行、」孔子有「弗能已矣」之歎、又次允須樂說蓋「知之者不如好之者、好之者不如樂之者、」文王之德之純、「純亦不已、」孔子仁且智旣聖、爲之不厭、誨人不倦、」其究在正行「誠之者擇善而固執之、更宜「篤行之、行之弗得弗措也不徒弗得弗措、人一能之己百之、人十能之已千之、中庸之「至誠無息、」易傳之「自强不息、」易傳「天行之健、」「逝水之流」夫、</p>
<h3>寗波鼠疫　週密防止傳染</h3>

<h3>倫敦人士　不畏空襲</h3>
<p>本埠某著名英僑、最近接倫教來函、述蘇聯軍部機關報紅星報近發表社評、略稱、德國對英之空中攻勢、顯已失敗、今日英國之實力、不特足以保衛本土、且已對德施行有效之空襲、倫敦遭受德機不斷的襲擊，損失頗巨、但該處防空設備周密、一切工業與其他活動、仍繼續無阻、</p>
<h3>謀福輪　食糧告罄　傳賣利江定亦被扣</h3>
<p>禮和洋行謀福輪、本月初在浙海洋面被日艦扣留、尙未獲釋、旅客船員均覊留輪中、昨日該輪有電到滬、報吿所載貨物、除郵件已起出外、其餘均不得搬動、目前旅客船員、因糧食吿罄、飢寒交迫、除巳請舟山方面設法救濟外、請公司當局亟予接濟、謀福輪船務部接電後、巳於昨日派員搭日輪赴舟山、携款前往接濟、一面並據情報吿德領事署再向日方交涉釋回、以謀旅客之安全、至德商魯麟洋行飛康輪及美商大生輪、現仍被扣在舟山洋面、各該輪公司曾分別去電詢問、但均遭退回、預料電臺亦爲日方所監視、致無法互通音訊、又聞義華洋行竇利輪，亦在松門外海面被日艦扣留、但公司尙無確實消息、江定輪外傳與賣利輪同時被扣、</p>
<h3>滬各界節約儲金　逾千萬元　宣傳週今日結束　決繼續推進不輟</h3>

<h3>美對日禁運趨勢</h3>
<p>美國對日，忍耐了三年之久，現已採取一種禁運行動。這種行動無異堅强的通知日本工業界，自此而後，日本所需白分之九—的廢鋼廢鐵，須另尋來源了。</p>
<p>但這一打擊，對於日本工業雖極兇猛，但並不如若干報紙大字標題听揭示的，美國鋼鐵供給日本，從此完全斷絕。在現行禁運以外，仍有人宗類似的貨物，如合金及鋼鐵半製品之類，仍照常供給日本軍隊大量消耗之用。這項純鋼在數量上雖較大批流入日本的鋼鐵碎片爲少，但在軍火製造上則手續更較簡使。</p>
<p>日本在去年一年，共向美國購買鋼鐵碎片三二，五九二，五〇〇美元，卽占其鋼鐵總輸入百分之九十。然在同時，日本還從美國購入合金五，九五八，七三九美元，卽占其此項輸入總額百分之九十八。五一，並且還購入鋼鐵半製品四，二二八，二七一美元，卽占其此項進口總額百分之三二。五三。</p>
<p>日本去年向美國購入的鋼鐵碎片，一方面比較合金與鋼鐵半製品兩項總値，超過三倍以上，但在另一方面，日本去年還有很長的一個時期，可以向歐洲購買，直至去年九月初二次歐戰發生以後，日本依賴美國接濟合金及鋼鐵的程度，始愈益增加。</p>
<p>至以一九三八年貿易而論，美國供給日本的精煉鋼鐵，價値一一，二五一，八〇四美元，日本國內工業的發達，一方面雖足以在一九三九年，减少該國從美國輸入此項鋼鐵，但由日本繼續輸人金屬工業機器觀之，足證日本在這一方面，仍未能達自給自足的程度。</p>
<p>美國經濟學家，對於日本繼續從美國不斷輸入金屬工業機器，特別感覺興趣，認爲在現代工業及軍事力量的技術基礎，日本仍需輸入大宗工業機器，乃北落後的明證。</p>
<p>據專家看來，這方面就是日本工業的弱點。一切機器及生產工具如果停止供給日本，日本不問繼續對華作戰，抑製造貨物輸出，以便換取外滙，皆爲不利。此項機器如果實行禁運，其對於日本經濟的打擊，比之禁運鋼鐵碎片及汽油，必然更大。</p>
<p>美幽正在加緊工業動員，以充實本國軍備並接濟英國。在這種情勢之下，美國官方好多人相信，美國除對西半球及英國外，完全停止工廠機器及生產工具的輸出，遲早必有實現的一日。據美國商務部最近報吿，美國機件對英輸出，在本年八月一月中巳增高白分之六十，這已可證明此項輸出，業巳由日本移往他國了。</p>
<p>更進一步對日禁運，必然包括汽車及載重車兩項，這兩項在去年一年間，美國供給日本的數量，占白分之七十六以上。美國若干汽車製造廠已騰出一部分的機器，改爲製造飛　引擎及戰車之用，這兩項軍備，英國需要甚殷，日本卽無美國國務部的反對，亦將無法購得美國車輛了。</p>
<p>因此，除開最初在道義上禁止飛機出口及後夾禁運飛機所用的汽油出口而外，美國業已更進一步禁止軍用品輸日。禁運鋼鐵碎片雖極車要，但合金及鋼鐵半製品的出口，仍未堵塞，德義日三國同盟的結果，也許會把這門完全關閉起來吧。（譯Christian　Seience　Monitor華盛頓電訊）</p>

<p>Navieert英國政府所發給之航運證書，證明所裝貨物並非輸德國者。可免貨物檢查　搜查之麻煩。</p>

<h3>老而彌堅的甘地</h3>
<p>— EL</p>
<p>甘地以七十歲的老翁，處此歐洲烽火連天，印度危機四伏的大動　時代，仍爲印度最活動的領袖。因爲年運的緣故，此老個人生活和一切動作，自不能不就着大自然的支配。面上的皺紋比徒前增多，睡眠的時間也較往昔爲長，而硬殼果等不容易咬　的東西，他巳摒隊勿進。所爲人所驚異的，就是他早起的習慣，一如已往。每天淸早四點鐘就起來參加團體祈禱，從不爽失。在實際上，他一天中最寶貴的思想和寫作工作，都完成於這清晨，時至四時的兩個鐘頭裹。祈禱旣竟，重復人睡，直至天亮始醒。起來吃些簡單的早餐，像羊乳水菓之類，然後步行英里，作爲一種運動。</p>
<p>甘地喜歡按摩，在冬天允喜日光浴。他的皮膚一分光緻潔凈，每爲往訪者所奇異。實則每天早上，他總要費上一個多鐘徐徐摩挲茶油，使他很容易得到熟睡。</p>
<p>每天的工作他都有一定規律，不容絲毫顚倒。上午十一時進膳，吃些羊乳，水菓，生的或蒸過的蔬菜，和鬆脆的土製黃麵包。一到中午尤其在夏季，總要休息一二小時。此時他的書記們把各種來往信整理　檔。如要他親覆親閱的，則擱置在他桌上。</p>
<p>下午一直到五時為止，接見賓客或商談要事。在太陽還未落山之前，他進晚膳。食品與早間相仿，不過份量少些，食畢，寫寫信，或為報紙選寫文章，直至七時始行晚禱。然後再像早間一樣，散步運動約半小時，九時入睡。</p>
<p>他住在「西華格拉姆」——意爲服務之村，處理一切公務。左右有許多他的信徒，而政治上的人物却很少見。他所感興味的非爲政治而爲民生問題。譬如如何開發農村，廢除階級，推行農村新敎育制度，改良貧民食物等。凡此種種他都得悉心去研究檢討，比之政治不知要多費上幾許心血哩。</p>
<p>甘地所關注的當然爲印度之自由，但是他的作風，不像印度國民大會的單求政治方式。他所醉心的事兩種原則：不用暴力和講眞理。甘地最恨暴力侵略，去年戰事旣起，他不朋其憂悶苦惟。而且最近兩年以來，印度國民會議中的有力份子，頗有表示反對甘地的主義，而欲出以反對行動者。但是甘地具有偉大的毅力，卓拔的見識，去歲九月以來，他自己照着他所主張的行去。深知希特勒的侵略主義將危害世界安定，和人類文明，他已表示無條件的擁護英法。至於印度之獲得解放再造，據他相信，乃是還早問題而已。但是他於與印度總督林立斯古爵士會見後，曾表示：「如英法戰敗，或德國滅亡，印度所希望之解放，其價値將何在乎？」</p>
<p>巳往數月中，甘地儘可使印度發生不服從之違悖行動，而予英人以莫大之痛苦。然而甘地之計不出此者，非謂暴動與不服從行動二者之間，相差甚機，實則渠所重視者，難不欲乘英人掙扎其生死存亡之秋，而予以憂亂無措之爲難。甘地寗願待戰事告終之後，提出印度之要求，而不欲以英人之危難，復作爲印度之良機也。</p>
<p>甘地器宇宏澈，不爲一切紛擾所惱。在羣情汹汹之下，能漠然不爲動搖；在他人酷厲指摘批評下，仍能出以笑談，無介於衷心。凡外來之一切困難，種種煩惱，甘地均能善爲解脫，此則得力於宗敎上之修簽爲鉅耳。</p>
<p>甘地以風燭殘年，果能目覩其祖國之解放，而達到其一已之願望乎？關於這點，他曾說過：「倘若在我有生之年，印度能歲自由，而我還有精力的話，我即以在野之身，仍當竭我棉薄，在不用暴力的原則之下，共同肩負「建國重任」。甘地之願望已於去歲七月中略覘梗槪。當時國民大會的領袖們，一致決議，在不用暴力的原則下，印度如不備武力，以抵抗外來的侵略，則甘地的見解，恐將無完成之日。</p>
<p>國民大會諸領袖與甘地的私人情感，可謂融合無間，親任有加，但雙方年齡相差咸在二十上下，其間於政治見解，自亦不無相異之處。國民大會主持對英　佈獨立，並在德里建立　時國民政府，英國如能接受此議，印度國民黨可以一片至誠，擁護英國作戰。惟英國方面尙未慨然接受。（譯紐約的泰晤十報雜誌）</p>

<h3>兒童行走安全教育</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>本市租界當局原定：六月中旬舉行的馬路安全運動，展期至本月十八日舉行到二十四日止，爲期一週。因爲我們知道在馬路肇禍案件中，受傷或死亡的人，兒童的數字也佔得很高，而且不僅在中國，就是海外各國亦然如此，所以覺得關於兒童行走安全敎育的提倡，是一個値得討論的問題。要求此一問題的收到實果，我以爲應由幾方面同時重視才好。</p>
<p>學校方面：目前一般的學校，允其是小學校，對於安全敎育的實施，雖然沒有規定的課程，但我們不能忽略這問題的重要。歐美各國目前對於安全敎育，非常重視，允其是行走安全敎育。我們雖缺乏安全敎育的工具和設施，但學校當局和敎師應時刻注意，負上促進行走安全敎育的使命，以减少枉死寃傷的兒童。隨時利用影片或口頭來灌輸行走安全的常識，如紅綠燈，巡捕的手勢，和司機人的手勢的辨別，並行走時所應特別注意的地方。</p>
<p>父母方面：大家知道，訓練兒童，敎育兒童的責任，在學校由敎師負，而在家庭非由父母負不可，所以安全敎育是極端的重要。允具是馬路行走安全，在安全敎育中所佔的地位更重要。做父母的也應把一切行路的安全方面和各種常識，液輸給兒童，告訴他們行路時怎樣才能安全，怎樣便很危險。如此兒童行走安全敎育，由學校與家庭雙方兼顧，自然可收事半功倍之利。</p>
<p>兒童方面：光就家庭與學校方面注意兒童行走安全敎育，還是不够，而最重要的一點，却在兒童本身的能够實行。關於都市中當局所定的交通規則，能够知道，穿馬路特別要小心，靠左邊走，紅綠燈的標幟，汽車夫的手勢，什麼都記在心裹。在走路的時候，小心翼翼，注意力不會放到別的事物上去。能够二方面合作，那兒童的行走問題，自然可增進不少安全哩！</p>
<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳（廿二）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>可是要學習雷影中的功課，倒也不是一件容易的事情。當我在「鬆髮兒」一片中工作時我先得知道怎樣跳那種跳繩踢躂舞。這種舞是要一面跳繩，一面作踢躂舞的。我料知有許多小孩子，和伊們的小朋友常在人行道上，玩着這跳繩的把戲的。然而我却不會跳繩，因此不得不跟着傑克杜努漢到體育室去，他敎我跳舞，給了我一根繩子，從頭指點我怎樣跳法的。可甘，你試想一，一個挺大的漢子，却敎一個小女孩子怎樣跳繩，這豈不是十分好玩的事嗎？</p>
<p>現在我巳能跳繩了，這是一種很好的遊戲。在初學的時候，確是一件艱苦的工作，因爲我學了第一課以後，兩條腿覺得有些痠痛的。我一面跳繩一面還能跳踢舞的步子。我到處帶着繩子，到處的跳着跳着。我在平屋中跳，在家裏的廊道中跳，更在攝影塲工作的　面上，和我作替身的女孩子一塊兒跳。跳到如今，我已把它當作我的一種運動了。</p>
<p>人家並不怎樣親近我，因爲我每决的工作一完畢後，就回到我的平屋中去，他們就沒有機會來和我接近了。希漢先生的意思，本來不要太多的人來和我接近，他並且不願意我到各城鎭中去露面，據說人多嘈雜，是和小女孩們極不相宜的。我對於這件事，倒並不在意，媽媽和爸爸也是如此，因爲我們三人都喜歡淸靜，而不喜歡熱閙的。</p>
<p>我覺得許多很有趣味的經歷中，有一件事使我很有回味的，便是在攝製小將軍」一片的時候，和兩個黑女孩子安鳳與南茶在一起做泥餅子玩。我們做這些泥餅，並不是供給影片裏用的，不過給我們自已玩罷了。此外我和金蕙漱合作「明眼」一片時，也得了一個玩笑快樂的機會。那時金的年紀是在十歲十一歲光景，在工作時，伊對於我的態度似乎不大好。到了休息的時間，伊自已也覺悟了，立刻跑到我跟前來，摟住了我的頭頸，懇切地說道：「秀蘭我剛才那麼對待你，使我抱歉得很！」我說這不算一回事，不用放在心上。於是我們倆手牽手的趕到園子裹去，那裏有一輛玩偶的睡車，是金在影片中推着走的。當初那個管理道具的人，不肯把這睡車給我們玩，經我們、番央求之後，終於應允了。那時金讓我推着，在園子裏繞着圈兒，金將一隻手放在車柄上，伴着我一塊兒走。呀，我們倆竟變做一對好朋友了！</p>
<h3>黑和白</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>初冬的氣候是一天比一天的冷起來了。阿明眼見得他自己的身上，由一件白色單薄的夏衣，變成了夾衣，後來又加了一件，允其是近幾天來，天氣特殊的冷了，母親竟把一件深黑色而厚厚的絨綫衫加在他的身上，於是他的身體在外表上瞧來，是胖了許多，加上了這好幾件衣服，當然是溫暖得多了。可是在早晚換衣的片刻間，覺得格外的寒冷。眞奇怪！在夏天穿了一件單衣，還覺得熱哩，如今穿了這許多衣服，到學校一路上的冷風，刮在他面上，畢竟有些刺骨的。不知怎的，阿明問着他哥哥：「爲什麽夏天的衣服都是白色的，而冬天的衣服大多是黑色，排道我在冬天小可穿白色的衣服嗎？」</p>
<p>「你問得很好，要知道我們的體溫是攝氏三十七度左右，如果空氣的溫度和體溫相差不大的時候，身體覺得很舒適，吾則便覺得不是熱，便是冷。而穿衣服的目的，在冷天便是使身體四周巳經暖熱的空氣不致逃跑；而在熱天，使體熱發散開去，因此一年四季中的氣候變化不同，便利用各種不同的材料做成衣服。在夏天，所穿的衣服，大都是麻布做的，因爲麻是最容易把體熱傳開去，而且在夏天，汗出得頂多，如果汗不蒸發，於是混身覺得難受，因此穿的都是很稀薄而白色，布眼很粗的衣服，可以使空氣直出直進，暢通無阻，卽使身體四周的熱空氣不致停切；白色的布，就是使太陽的熱不能元全吸收，而大部分都反射出去，這是白顏色特有的性質，而且在眼中瞧起來，也凉快得多。冬天，外界的溫度很低，我們的體溫容易發散，那就覺得寒冷了，便要穿上了好幾層衣服，才覺溫暖，不但增加了衣服的厚，而月就無異增加了包含在其中的空氣，因爲空氣是不導熱的，穿在最外層的衣服，假使使得它不通氣，空氣一點都不讓它出去，便很溫暖了。絲綿衣服之最溫暖就因爲它質地很疏鬆，包含的空氣也頂多。毛皮衣服，我們應把毛的一面穿在裏面，便很溫暖，而許多愛時髦的女子，把毛皮露在外面，除了好看之外，一些也不暖，這眞沒有道理。而深黑的顏色，便有把太陽的熱全部吸收的特性，所以覺得黑衣服很溫暖。在冬天，穿白色的，也未始不可，不過是冷在你自己的身上，與旁人沒有關係的呀！」</p>
<h3>小學生暑期作業競賽　高級第三名　記暑假中一件有意義的事</h3>
<p>— 德年小學　唐餘憂</p>
<p>自「八一三」戰事開始以後，物價一天天地高漲，生活一天天地艱難，許多同胞，在生活鞭子高壓下，爲了生存，苦苦的工作，終日不得一飽，對於他們子女的讀書問題，多數是無暇顧及了，以致戰後的上海，各弄子裏增加了許多沒有書讀，只好遊蕩的孩子。他們終日遊蕩，不受敎育，自然入於下流了。</p>
<p>我們學校，也在一個弄子裏，不能例外，也有一羣野孩子，常在我們學校的前門後戶，欺侮一般小同學。搶小同學的玩具哩；拋小同學的帽子哩；打駡小同學哩；擠軋衝撞女同學哩，種種惡形惡狀，他們都做得出來。</p>
<p>當學校裏上課的時候，他們就在門外牆上，用白粉筆寫侮辱學校裏帥長或同學的字句，或者在門外敲幾下，好像有人打門似的，等到開出門來一看，却連一個影子也沒有，眞是討厭</p>
<p>經師長調查的結果，知道這羣野孩子的領袖，名叫史根，他也讀過五年書，可是現在沒有錢，所以停學了。</p>
<p>暑假裏，學校裏做了一隻乒乓桌，給我們遊戲，史根見了，很有趣！他便請求老師，允許他加入一同遊玩，並自己保證，以後決不再來胡閙。老師因欲使其變成一個良好的孩子，就答應了他得要求。一方面使其得到正當的遊戲，不再胡鬧，一方面還可隨時感化他，使他漸漸改過，成為一個好人。一個多月來，果然改惡從善，客客氣氣，在學校裏一些不吵，就是對弄子裏其他的小孩，也不再無法無天了。</p>

<h3>電影界醞釀一訟案</h3>
<p>— 銀翼</p>
<p>國華將控袁美雲背約　袁延陳霆說律師辨議</p>
<p>最近的電影界中，將發動一件訟案，現正在醞釀之中，如果不能消弭的話，那實在是一件不幸的事。</p>
<p>訟案的發動者是國華影業公司主人柳中浩，而控訴的對象則是袁美雲。</p>
<p>此一事件的內在情形是如此：</p>
<p>去年的十二月間，國華計劃排製「華麗緣」，主角屬　於袁美雲，袁美雲是中國聯合影業公司的基本演員，國華企圖請她客串，最初派周璇同袁延雲遊說，周漩是柳中浩的義女，與袁美雲則過去是藝華公司的同事，向來感情很好，周璇在袁美雲之前，沒有作露骨的表示，不過慫恿袁美雲小妨爲國華客串一兩部戲，意思之間，如果袁美雲同意的話，她可以居間介紹；但袁美雲當時是拒絕了她的好意。之後，柳中浩親自往訪袁美雲，提出客串拍戲的請求。袁美雲因爲一則與國聯訂有合同，二則她的外子王引在香港，自己不能作主，根據了這兩點理由，婉辭謝絕了。後來柳中浩接速的造訪袁美雲三次，最後一决是帶了二千元現鈔去，他的措辭十分委婉，表示如果國聯總經理張善琨不允許她爲國華客串拍戲，或是王引回來了反對，都不妨作爲罷論，將錢退還就算。他更鄭重聲明，祇要袁美雲將錢收下了，拍戲無論什麼時候實踐都可以，不必亟亟於一時。當時袁美雲以盛情難却，便向柳中浩提出兩點：（一）如國聯常局不通過時，當退回此軟，取消原議。（二）每片酬勞至少五千圓。</p>
<p>磋商的結果，　中浩對於第一點，本是他所提議，表示絕對無問題，而酬勞則要求减爲三千元。袁美雲之意，以爲此事在國聯方面，未必能通過，柳中浩旣有不通過時作爲罷論的口頭保證，於是也就答應了。當下在收據上簽了字，收據上訂叫拍三部戲，酬勞是九千元，先付一千元作爲定洋。</p>
<p>待袁美雲什收據上簽了字，將定洋收了，柳中浩就向袁美雲聲明，三部中的一部戲是「華麗緣」，預備分上下集的。袁美雲對於道一件事立刻表示不可，因爲這樣就等於拍四部戲了。柳中浩答應她容緩冉談。</p>
<p>其後王引在香港，得悉此事，大不以爲然，於是寫了一封快信給袁美雲，阻止她接受國華的邀的。袁美雲就將二千兀定洋，存入嘉定商業儲蓄銀仃，一方面將此事經過報吿張善琨，請他調解。王引從香港回滬後，更挽請嘉定銀行總經理樊良伯（時猶未逝世），從中斡旋，願遵照當初柳中浩的諾言，退還定洋，作爲罷論。但國華方面却不答應，目催促袁美雲實踐前的。</p>
<p>事情差不多陷於僵局了，國華根據了那一紙收據，非要袁美雲履行不可；而袁美雲則堅决拒絕；這事一直延擱到最近，國華又重提舊事，發了一張拍戲通吿給袁美雲，袁美雲當然不接受；於是盛傳國華方面將對袁延雲提起背的之訴，要求賠償損失。</p>
<p>現在，袁美雲也在籌謀對付之策，她已延請陳霆銳律師爲法律顧問，如果一旦成訟的話，就請陳律師出庭辯護。</p>
<p>逆料此事的發展，勢將引起電影界甚大的注意了。</p>
<h3>王化影的魔術</h3>
<p>淸心中學曾於十三日起假寗波同鄕會舉行八十週紀念大會，至昨日止，一連三天，有話劇，音樂，滑稽，國術等種種表演，情殊熱烈。其中有王化影的魔術，　是罕見，如空箱出現女人，小旗變成大旗等，均甚有趣，尤其末一節憑空橫趟女人，更足令人驚奇；先是一個站着的女子，經王化影施行催眠術後，女子就筆挺地直立，再由二個助手把她憑空橫趟着，上面沒有吊繩，下面也沒有支撐；接着，又用一鐵圈，從頭部套至脚部，以表示空中無吊，地下無擱，據說，此種魔術來自印度，上海倒是難得看見的。</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十一章　趙伯雄的供詞</p>
<p>霍桑抬頭瞧着他，問道：「你開槍的時候，分明認爲伊還是活着的。對不對？」</p>
<p>趙伯雄有些侷促不安的樣子。他的舌尖又露釗嘴脣外面來。他不自在地說：「是的，這是我的粗莽，其實也是我過度興奮的緣故。不過這一個誤點，我一回上汽車，立刻感到。因有伊中槍以後，非但不曾叫喊，我彷彿記得，連牽動的動作都沒有。我就疑心伊也許已先被人謀死，我祗打中了一個死人！」</p>
<p>霍桑的脣角上忽而露出微笑，不過那笑容一剎那便消滅不見。他冷冷地說：「你的誤點發覺得眞很迅速，同時你對於你自己的發槍技術，也有很高的估價。」</p>
<p>趙伯雄的眼睛又張大了。「霍先生，請你容許我說一句放肆的話。我的手槍射擊，在十碼以內，成績可以有百分之九九。」</p>
<p>他說這話時，他的神氣和聲調，都有一種洋洋自得的表示，我暗忖他的誇張的說話，幸虧還留着一分。亞東旅館電話間木壁上的一彈，大概就是他的美中不足的餘下的一分了。</p>
<p>他叉補　說：「其實就是我的手槍不曾打中，伊如果是個活人，也應當有喊叫和站起來的動作。我的覺悟到自己的誤點原是很自然的。」</p>
<p>「我回到旅館以後，唯一的打算，就是這件事情揭發出來，我爲着我的任務的緣故，決不能被牽速在裏面。因此，我暫時換了一個房問。今天早晨化了裝，重新到七樓去繞一周，臉瞧有沒有人疑心到我。我恰巧瞧見了兩位先生正在向七十一號阿根調查。我有些兒害怕，因爲我知道這件事經了霍先生的手，而且叉已注意到我的身上，我的被牽連的危險簡直已沒法逃避。」他忽縐緊了眉毛，兩隻手交握着，表示出一種深切的懊悔。他繼續說：一霍先生，我現在回想，我那時眞是太愚蠢了。我想不到用坦白的態度向你說明原委，却一時昏憒，竟採用了那種笨拙的警吿方式。霍先生，這是我十二分抱歉的。」（一六八）</p>

<h3>America Will Not Yield in the Far East; British Battleships to be Stationed in Singapore; Takahashi's Mad Theories of Seizing All of East Asia; Says War Between US and Japan is Inevitable</h3>
<p>Washington - Former Japanese Supreme Military Counselor and Admiral of the Navy, Takahashi, recently made remarks outlining the scope of the new Asian order, saying it starts from China's Northeast (Manchuria) and extends to Australia, west to the Bay of Bengal and Burma. Japan, according to its national strength and environmental needs, will gradually advance through Manchuria, China, Vietnam, Burma, the Straits Settlements, the Dutch East Indies, New Caledonia Islands, New Guinea and other Pacific islands, the Philippines, Australia and other parts of the East Indies. Takahashi also said that war with the United States is inevitable and cannot be resolved until Japan and the United States have a decisive battle. Japan is now determined to face a war with the United States. Without this determination, how could we have concluded the Tripartite Pact? If the United States wants to avoid war, it is not impossible, but it must abandon the Open Door Policy and recognize Japan's new order in Asia. People here, hearing these arguments, do not find them strange. One newspaper headline asked, "Is that all?" According to people here, Takahashi's statement of the Japanese Empire's dreams is clear, letting people know Japan's true purpose, unlike the vacillating behavior of ordinary politicians who sometimes advocate war with the United States and sometimes advocate peace. If Japan's plans are as Takahashi says, then the US-Japan war he foresees is indeed possible. Therefore, there is evidence here indicating that the United States will not abandon its current position on the status quo in the Pacific. Some well-informed observers say that the United States has obtained assurances that it will not yield in the Far East, and military commentators here also say that the serious blow suffered by Italy in Taranto will have a great impact in the Far East. Since half of Italy's main battleships have been destroyed, Britain can send a battleship fleet to Singapore. It is estimated that Britain has sixteen active battleships, and three more will soon be added. Therefore, Britain can now station three battleships at each end of the western Mediterranean, and five of the latest battleships will patrol the Atlantic Ocean, searching for enemy raiders and for general combat purposes, and transfer the remaining five to Singapore. Major Eliot, a famous American commentator, said that with this British support, the policy of Britain and the United States applying economic and naval pressure on Japan offers the best hope of clarifying the situation in the Far East and allowing the resources of Australia, Malaya and India to be supplied to the Middle East Army without interruption. General opinion here believes that the stationing of British battleships in Singapore will prevent people in the Japanese naval circles from making further pronouncements about seizing all of the East and including Australia in the Japanese Empire's territory. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The "Red Star" newspaper published a lengthy article reviewing the recent international situation, stating that the most important event in the recent international situation was Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's trip to Berlin. Molotov's trip will allow for direct consultation and friendly exchange of views with German leaders, which will promote relations between the Soviet Union and Germany, and benefit both countries. Regarding Japan's withdrawal of troops from Nanning in the Far East, its increase in troops to Hainan Island and the Tokyo area, and Japan's demand to Vietnam to occupy Cochinchina and Saigon, these actions indicate that Japan intends to take action in the south. The establishment of the South Seas Affairs Bureau by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs also proves this trend. In order to cope with Japan's southward advance, Britain and the United States have taken new measures to strengthen their position in the South Seas. As a result of recent talks between Britain, the United States and Australia, the Pacific Joint Defense Treaty has been established. According to the views of foreign military circles, open conflict between the United States and Japan is only a matter of time. (15th telegram)</p>
<h3>Pan American Company to Expand Routes; Will Borrow Singapore's Civil Aviation Station</h3>
<p>New York - Pan American Airlines announced that it will expand its routes to Singapore and has applied to the Civil Aeronautics Authority for a permit. If approved, it will be implemented immediately. This new route will fly from Manila to Hong Kong and Singapore once a week. Its landing point in Singapore will borrow the Singapore airfield, and has already obtained permission from the British authorities to use all the facilities of the station. This statement is actually the strongest expression of America's determination to maintain its interests in the Far East and resist Japan. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Helping China Develop Industry; Yarnell Urges Americans to Host Fundraising Campaign</h3>
<p>New York - Former Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, last night urged Americans to continue to help China's industrial development movement. Admiral Yarnell strongly advocated that the American public host a fundraising campaign, with the "American Aid to China Industrial Cooperation Committee" raising US$200,000 to respond to China's cooperation movement. He said that this cooperative movement is sufficient to create a new stable area in the Far East and to revive the destruction of the Sino-Japanese War. Yarnell said that this movement is of direct importance to Americans, because this donation is the best way to express the courage of Americans to sympathize with China and their attempts to revive their economic institutions.

<h3>Uruguay to be Built as a Giant Fortress; For the Defense of the Americas</h3>
<p>Montevideo - Yesterday, the government here decided to rebuild Uruguay into a giant fortress for the defense of the Americas. After a large number of military preparations were approved in principle at the cabinet meeting, officials announced that all American countries, including the United States, could use Uruguay's key ports and base facilities to defend against foreign aggression. It is generally predicted that this great program will include the construction of countless naval, land and air military bases. When the project is completed, these bases "will be able to see each other." The program stipulates that it be implemented in the shortest possible time, and that a large number of artillery and other war materials will be deployed. It is believed that the adoption of this plan is a major step forward in completing the Pan-American defense plan. This plan was discussed and recorded at the Pan-American Conference several months ago. Although it had been agreed upon in principle by all countries at the time, this is the first time that a South American country has decided to implement this plan on a large scale.

<h3>Soviet Union Digs Canal in Desert; 100,000 People Participate in Work</h3>
<p>Moscow - A 180-kilometer-long canal will be built in the Karakum Desert (part of the Uzbek Republic of Asia). Construction will begin in December, with 100,000 collective farmers participating. They must dig eight million meters of soil. At the same time, the authorities have decided to use 2,000 camels to transport food to support the farmers. After the canal is built, 43,000 hectares of land will be irrigated. (TASS, 15th)</p>
<h3>Indians Eagerly Donate Money; To Purchase Aircraft to Help Britain</h3>
<p>London - Madras Radio said that India has so far remitted £1.5 million to London to purchase military aircraft to be incorporated into the British Air Force. This money was donated by people from all over India, from princes to commoners. In addition, India's donation to the Lord Mayor of London's Air Raid Relief Fund has exceeded £150,000.

<h3>Important Figure in Chinese Air Force, Mao Bangchu, Flies to America; Immediately Transfers from San Francisco to Washington; To Discuss the Issue of Increasing Material Assistance</h3>
<p>Washington - Chinese Air Force General Mao Bangchu and Colonel Chennault, military advisor to the Chinese government, have now arrived in San Francisco and will fly to Washington immediately. It is reported that they will hold talks with American military and civilian authorities. It is believed that the discussions will be related to the plan to increase material assistance to China from the United States. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Suggests Division of Spheres of Influence; Soviet Union Officially Denies; And Rejects This Claim as Absurd</h3>
<p>Moscow - New York "World Telegram" recently published a report by Sims, the international editor of the Howard newspaper series, saying, "Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Tatekawa has made a suggestion to the Soviet Union, saying that if the Soviet Union joins the Tripartite Alliance, Japan is willing to cede all or part of British India to the Soviet Union, and at the same time suggests that the Soviet Union abandon eastern Siberia and give it to Japan." TASS recently issued an official statement authorizing that the above report is absurd and does not conform to the facts at all. (TASS, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - This morning, all Chinese newspapers here published in prominent positions the news that the Soviet authorities officially denied the news that an understanding had been reached between the Soviet Union and Belarus that the Soviet Union would stop aiding China. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Revelations of the Japanese Imperial Conference</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Miyako Shimbun editorial today said that although the methods decided at the Imperial Conference held on Wednesday have not yet been officially announced, some progress must have been made in resolving the China Incident. It is best for Chongqing to consider peace before Japan officially recognizes the new government in Nanjing. The Miyako Shimbun also commented on the talks between Hitler and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, saying that although we do not believe that they directly discussed Soviet-Japanese relations, we believe that the strengthening of Soviet-German coordination also has a great indirect impact on Japan. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>200 Soviet Astronomers Prepare to Observe Eclipse</h3>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Stabilizing the Far East Depends on This One Move</h3>
<p>Regret, although the most painful thing, sometimes has educational value. What is valuable is that after regret, one suddenly changes course, catches up quickly, otherwise regret is useless, and even incurable. For example, in the Far East issue, since 1931, the democratic countries have consistently failed to prescribe the right medicine, resulting in step-by-step setbacks and failures in everything, and finally brewed a broken and chaotic situation, which is what the democratic countries regret today. With the belief that "forgetting the past is a guide to the future," this newspaper issued the proposal of "first settling the Far East" the day before yesterday, hoping that Britain and the United States will intensify their assistance to China and first eliminate the root of the disaster in the Far East. Observing the international dynamics of the past few days, I deeply feel that this proposal of this newspaper is not only reasonable, but also shows that this kind of possibility is already visible. In today's situation where wars in the East and West can continue to expand at any time, this may be a turning point in the development of the situation, and it is necessary to extend it further.</p>
<p>Originally, in the past three or four years, everyone in the world who holds good intentions has hoped that the democratic countries can unite to jointly sanction the forces of aggression. Even now, I dare say that there are still many people praying silently for the realization of cooperation between the four countries of China, the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States. As for the fact that the three countries of Germany, Italy and Japan have formed an alliance, the increased ties between the three countries of China, Britain and the United States have been seen in many actions. What is in doubt now is only the Soviet Union, especially on the day Molotov reciprocated his visit to Berlin, the world spread complex and confusing news. Among them, the most widely spread news, in terms of Europe, is that the Soviet Union will further assist Germany and Italy to resist Britain. In terms of Asia, it is that the Soviet Union and Japan will establish an agreement. Even more alarmingly, the general idea is that the four countries of Germany, Italy, Japan and the Soviet Union will jointly establish a new world order, and the first step will be to jointly destroy the British Empire in order to divide its territories and spheres of influence. All of this undoubtedly stems from the confusing position of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Although it is well known that Moscow diplomacy takes ruthless realism as its starting point, the actions of the Kremlin authorities sometimes inevitably make people feel unpredictable. If this phenomenon is viewed from a philosophical perspective, it may be said that it is because the fundamental position of ordinary observers is different from that of the Soviet Union, so it is very difficult to grasp the mindset of the people in Moscow. Only one thing can be considered certain, that is: the socialist Soviet Union led by Stalin is unwilling to be involved in the so-called "imperialist war" before it is directly invaded. Not only is it unwilling to be involved in the whirlpool of war, but it is even happy to watch the world's powers kill each other, so that it can carry out its plan for a worldwide socialist revolution in the future. This view may not be suitable for the true intentions of the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union has its own reasons for incurring this suspicion. Based on this point of view, and then silently observing the general trend in Europe and Asia today, it may be inferred that the Soviet Union will continue to maintain the same attitude towards the wars in the East and West in the future. In other words, for the European war, the Soviet Union may continue to adopt a pro-German neutral attitude due to military, political, economic and even geographical considerations, in order to help the Axis powers overcome the difficulties in the current war with Britain, Greece and Egypt. For the Far East war, it will never change course because of Germany's instigation, abandon China and join hands with Japan. Even if it establishes a non-aggression pact with Japan, it will only, as this newspaper has repeatedly argued in the past, refrain from attacking each other for the time being in order to allow Japan to advance southward. At this moment, what decision Molotov has made with the German authorities regarding the European war is not within the scope of this article's comments, so I will not discuss it for the time being. Regarding the Far East part, although there is still no concrete expression from the Soviet official until now, at least TASS has issued two decisions in the past two days that we recognize: one, to recognize that an agreement has been established between the Soviet Union and Japan to divide the Far East spheres of influence and that the Soviet Union has agreed to stop aiding China; second, to add our approval to the fact that "Japanese Ambassador Tatekawa once invited the Soviet Union to join the Three-Nation Alliance, and exchanged British India for eastern Siberia." From this, it can be seen that not only is the rumor that Japan and the Soviet Union are about to cooperate not entirely credible, but also if Japan brazenly advances southward, there is no reason to believe that the Soviet Union can help it. This means that if Britain and the United States take tough actions in the Far East in the future, Germany and Italy will not be able to help Japan because they are unable to help themselves and are beyond their reach, and the Soviet Union may not change its consistent policy to attack China's comrades. Based on this, if China, Britain and the United States decide to jointly resolve the source of chaos in the Far East, even if the Soviet Union does not actively participate, it will at least not hinder it from doing so. Therefore, the practice of this major task will completely depend on the determination and efforts of China, Britain and the United States. There is absolutely no doubt about the firm resistance of the Chongqing government. The recent victories of the Chinese army on all fronts and the successive retreats of the Japanese army in western Guangdong and southern Guangxi are clear evidence that China is becoming more courageous and stronger in the war. In terms of Britain, the establishment of the Far East Military Region is indeed a major measure. Washington even observes that Britain can send five main battleships to Singapore, which may be the prelude to cooperation between the British and American navies in the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. As for the United States, in addition to increasing the defense of the Philippines, Secretary of the Navy Knox also made an amazing statement the day before yesterday, clearly stating that "the United States should aid China with the attitude of aiding Britain." Furthermore, seeing that General Mao Bangchu, commander of the Chinese Air Force, is going to the United States to negotiate the issue of material assistance, and that Pan American Airlines is planning to extend its routes to Hong Kong and Singapore, it can be seen that the United States will indeed consider providing further assistance to China as this newspaper suggested a few days ago. At a time when Tokyo is making all kinds of southward advances and news of the Japanese army landing in Saigon is frequently reported, the active attitude of Britain and the United States is indeed a "corrective" and a last-ditch effort to salvage the various mistakes of the past. I earnestly hope that British and American politicians from Roosevelt Churchill onwards will never repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Yichang Attack Yuanjia Village Without Success; Chinese Troops in Southeast of Shashi Capture Yaowan; Japanese Warehouse Burned Down with Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Xigui - Part of the Japanese army in Yichang, under the cover of artillery fire on the morning of the 12th, attacked Yuanjia Village in China again. After a fierce attack by the Chinese army, the Japanese retreated with many corpses left behind. (16th telegram)</p>
<p>Changde - On the 10th, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese army in Yaowan, southeast of Shashi, and captured the Japanese position in one fell swoop, defeating the Japanese army and recovering Yaowan. (16th telegram)</p>
<p>Changde - A telegram from a certain place along the river reported that at 4 pm on the 14th, a sudden fire broke out in the Shichi San area of Shashi, which lasted for several hours before it was extinguished. It is reported that the Japanese warehouse was burned down and the losses were extremely heavy. The cause of the fire has not yet been ascertained. (15th telegram)</p>
<p>Xiushui - More than 1,000 Japanese troops with four artillery pieces from Wushijie and Putou in Xirui County attacked Gangbei on the 11th. The Chinese army bravely resisted. By the morning of the 12th, the Japanese were unable to support and collapsed. The Chinese took advantage of the victory to pursue and have approached Putou and surrounded the area. In this battle, they captured 15 war horses, more than 50 rifles, and a large amount of grain and ammunition. (15th telegram)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Chinese authorities here formally announced today that the war in southern Guangxi has ended after the Japanese army completely withdrew from Nanning, Qin County and Zhennanguan. According to Chinese sources, there is still fighting near Zhennanguan. After the Japanese army reinforced from Lang Son, Vietnam, they attacked several times. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - General Gu Zhutong, commander of the Third War Zone of the Chinese Army, told visiting reporters at a certain front-line headquarters today that the military situation in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin is very calm. The purpose of the recent Japanese offensive was to seize food, because the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui are all rich agricultural areas, and rice can be harvested in October. However, due to the rapid counterattack of the Chinese army, the Japanese only looted a small amount from the granaries in southern Anhui and western Zhejiang. During the offensive in October, the Japanese army mostly used cavalry, and stayed in any place for a maximum of two or three days. It is estimated that the total strength of the Japanese army in central China is about 200,000 people, but it is believed that the Japanese army in central China may not take action immediately. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>Measures to Eradicate Opium and Narcotics Among Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The final deadline for the six-year phased opium prohibition is approaching, after which opium prohibition within the country will be declared complete. In light of the increasingly serious problem of overseas Chinese becoming addicted to opium and narcotics in recent years, the Ministry of Interior, in order to comprehensively rectify the situation and eradicate the scourge, submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to convene relevant ministries and commissions for consultation and to determine five measures for eradication: (1) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should, based on the circumstances, notify the governments of relevant countries, requesting that they uphold humanitarian principles, respect the resolution of the 20th International Labour Conference in 1936 regarding the relief of smoking workers within their jurisdictions, and the spirit of previous international anti-opium conventions. The notification should also include the Chinese government's determination regarding opium prohibition and the completion of the six-year prohibition plan. (2) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should order all consulates to investigate the number of overseas Chinese who smoke or sell opium, as well as the relevant laws of the local governments and existing smoking cessation facilities. This should be completed within two months of receiving the order, with local consulates being responsible for eradicating opium and narcotics among overseas Chinese within their jurisdictions. (3) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Department, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission should mobilize overseas Chinese to conduct anti-opium propaganda and register opium addicts for cessation, as well as raise funds to establish smoking cessation facilities for free treatment. Such organizations should register with the consulates and be forwarded to the central government for commendation to provide encouragement. (4) Effective smoking cessation medications already determined by the Ministry of Health should be distributed to smoking overseas Chinese through the consulates for self-cessation. (5) The Ministry of Interior should compile and print anti-opium pamphlets detailing the severe harm of opium and narcotics, as well as the achievements of domestic opium prohibition and the completion of the six-year prohibition plan, and send them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Overseas Department, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission for distribution to raise awareness among overseas Chinese.

(United Press dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>Athens: As a result of two fierce bayonet charges by Greek infantry, most of the rocky highlands northeast of Korçë have been occupied. This is the most courageous offensive since the start of the war. The Greek army's objective is a certain mountain 6,000 feet high. If they can completely occupy it, it will make it more difficult for the Italian army to defend Korçë. It is reported that the fighting in the Korçë area is extremely fierce and still ongoing, indicating that the Italian army is well aware of the importance of the battle northeast of Korçë and is therefore doing its utmost to defend its positions in order to cope with the Greek army, whose morale has been boosted by recent victories. According to a bulletin announced by the headquarters of the British Air Force in Greece, a convoy of Italian motorized transport vehicles moving in the area north of Korçë was bombed and heavily damaged by British aircraft with machine gun fire.

<p>Invading Italian Troops Undergo Reorganization; Frontline Commanders Repeatedly Changed</p>
<p>London: After the Greek army entered Albania, it is now striving to carry out military sweep operations. Yesterday, the Greek army captured 700 people and many artillery pieces. According to sources in London military circles, the Italian side has a total of 200,000 to 250,000 troops and some military supplies in Albania, but if they cannot maintain their transportation lines with Italy, it is feared that they will not be able to carry out large-scale military operations in Greece. This refers to Durazzo, because 80% of the heavy military supplies from the Italian canals depart from there. The recent reorganization of the Italian army proves that the Italian army completely underestimated the strength of Greek resistance. The Italian army has now been divided into two armies. One will be commanded by General Vanselino, commander of mechanized units, and the second will be led by General Silosu. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<h3>Germany to Exert Significant Pressure on Turkey; Papen Returns to Post with New Proposals</h3>
<p>Istanbul: The Turkish ambassador to Germany returned to the Turkish capital after Molotov's visit to Berlin. At the same time, the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, also returned to his post. Turkish political figures believe that there will be important developments in Turkish diplomacy. (Haitong News Agency dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Well-informed German sources recently stated that they expect German Ambassador to Turkey Papen to return here from Germany soon, carrying "certain proposals." However, the nature of these proposals is unknown. However, some political figures here believe that these proposals must be a request for Turkey to maintain strict neutrality when Germany assists Italy in attacking Greece. Greek figures here also believe that Germany may assist Italy, but say that it is actually beneficial to Germany if Turkey remains neutral. Well-informed sources also believe that if Germany assists Italy, its troops will pass through Yugoslavia instead of Bulgaria, because the Germans believe that if Bulgaria participates in the war, Turkey will also send troops to participate. A certain Bulgarian figure here said that Italy has asked Bulgaria not to interfere in the Italo-Greek war and warned the country to recognize the consequences of intervening in the Italo-Greek war. Therefore, Bulgaria has assured Turkey that it has no intention of interfering in the Italo-Greek war. In light of the reported proposals from the German side, people here are waiting with close attention for the return of Turkish Ambassador to Germany Papen to the Turkish capital. In addition, authoritative figures here all believe that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's talks in Berlin will not lead to a Soviet attack on Turkey. However, many people here feel uneasy about this. The "Akşam" newspaper here said that the Berlin talks should be viewed from the perspective of the Soviet Union's determination to maintain neutrality. (United Press dispatch of the 16th)</p>

<h3>Spain Annexes Tangier; U.S. Protests; U.S. Considering Countermeasures to Spanish News Ban</h3>
<p>Washington: The U.S. protested to Madrid yesterday after Spain forcibly occupied the Tangier International Zone. The U.S. is also considering countermeasures to Spain's ban on American news agencies from sending news from Spain since Monday. The nature of the protest over the Tangier incident has not been announced by the U.S., but it is understood that the U.S. has taken a firm stance against Spain's violation of the treaty, which made the zone an international territory. According to the 1928 Tangier Conference, the U.S. holds treaty rights there. In view of Spain's serious measures, informed sources believe that Spain's move may be a sign that it will share the fate of the Axis powers. The news ban in Madrid will take effect after Monday, at which time the international press, United Press, Associated Press, New York Times, and Chicago Tribune, and other American news agencies and newspapers will be prohibited from sending news from Spain. Although the implementation of this ban is a retaliatory measure against the expulsion of a reporter from the Spanish official news agency from the U.S., government officials here suspect that it serves other purposes. The general opinion is that General Franco's government wants to conceal everything that is happening in Spain at this time. (International News Service dispatch of the 16th)</p>

<h3>British Government Makes Efforts to Promote Relations with the Soviet Union; Hopes to Conclude a Non-Aggression Treaty; Three Proposals Made, No Reply Received</h3>
<p>London: According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, on October 22nd, the British side made a proposal to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky through the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Cripps, which included (1) Britain's de facto recognition of the incorporation of the Baltic states into the Soviet Union; (2) Guaranteeing that the Soviet Union would be invited to participate in any post-war peace settlement; (3) Guaranteeing that Britain would never join any attack on the Soviet Union. So far, the British government has not received a reply. It is reported that Sir Cripps' proposal to the Soviet Union of these far-reaching suggestions was primarily to dispel misunderstandings and seek to establish a temporary agreement between Britain and the Soviet Union. The solemn guarantee provided by the British side that it would never ally with other countries or join other groups to attack the Soviet Union can be said to be the British side's suggestion to the Soviet Union to conclude a permanent non-aggression treaty. Of course, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov knew about this suggestion from the British side long before the invitation to visit Berlin arose. (Reuters dispatch of the 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: In order to protest against Britain's detention of debts and deposits of banks in the Baltic states, the Soviet Union has now taken various retaliatory measures.

In addition, the interest on the £10 million export loan in 1937 will also be stopped. Since the British government is the guarantor of this loan, the British government should pay the creditors on behalf of the Soviet Union. (Haitong dispatch of the 16th)</p>

<p>London, The Aviation Ministry stated that on Thursday, Berlin's largest railway terminal and freight yards were heavily damaged by British air force night raids, further disrupting the already damaged German transportation system. Berlin is the most important railway hub in Central Europe, and damage affects not only Germany itself but also the transportation of all the countries it has ravaged. A British bomber pilot who attacked Berlin yesterday said that a terrifying explosion illuminated the sky in a certain area of Berlin. The land artillery temporarily fell silent, and the clear moon was perfect for bombing. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>Residents of Lorraine Province Expelled; German Authorities Order Relocation; Refugees Flock to the Free Zone</h3>
<p>Lyon, Since the 11th of this month, German authorities in the French province of Lorraine have ordered the relocation of residents of French descent from the province. Every day, trains carrying 6,000 of these refugees pass through here to the Free Zone. Most of these refugees were residents along the Franco-German border in 1914. They recently received a notice from the German authorities stating that they must choose between relocating to Poland or the French Free Zone. It is also heard that the German authorities have provided assurances that those willing to relocate to Poland can temporarily reside in their original locations. However, most people still decided to relocate to the French Free Zone and were forced to leave in a hurry within a few hours, preventing them from bringing their belongings. When they arrived here by train, their situation was pitiful. The train cars were adorned with the French flag and the Lorraine Cross flag, and several Red Cross doctors accompanied them to treat illnesses. The government also sent representatives to care for them and send them to various provinces in the south and southwest. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<h3>Spanish Foreign Minister Invited to Visit Berlin Again; This Trip Will Determine Spain's Future Diplomatic Strategy; Ribbentrop to Meet Him in Southern Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin, Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer, recently invited by the German government, departed from Paris yesterday afternoon for Berlin. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Madrid, The authorities here issued a brief communique announcing the news of Foreign Minister Suñer's visit to Germany. Official sources remained tight-lipped about this visit. The secretary of the Spanish Moroccan High Commissioner also accompanied Suñer. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin, The news of Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer's visit to Germany was quite unexpected by most people, even those in political circles who are usually well-informed. According to reports from Paris last night, Suñer had already departed from Madrid and is expected to meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop tonight or tomorrow morning. German officials have adopted a reserved attitude towards Suñer's visit and have not even announced the location of the talks with Ribbentrop. Judging from the Berlin official announcement that the Spanish Foreign Minister will visit Germany but not Berlin, the location of the talks will not be in Berlin. It is widely rumored here that Ribbentrop will leave Berlin today for southern Germany. This is the third meeting between the Spanish Foreign Minister and the Germans in eight weeks. Suñer came to Berlin on September 16th as Franco's representative. According to Spanish newspapers, the negotiations will determine Spain's future diplomatic policy. Suñer was appointed Foreign Minister on October 17th. On October 20th, German Police Chief Himmler met with Franco and Suñer in Madrid. Three days later, Führer Hitler met with Franco and Suñer on the Franco-Spanish border. The Spanish officials did not disclose the content of Hitler's talks with Franco, only stating that "the two countries are connected by comradely friendship." However, the content of the negotiations can still be discerned. The third round of talks to be held will continue the previous negotiations, which have been ongoing for the past eight weeks.

<p>Berlin, The "Berlin Rome Tokyo" magazine published an article reviewing the "African Question," believing that this issue has already been discussed when Hitler met with Mussolini, Pétain, and Franco. Africa is an extension of Europe, just as South America is an extension of North America. European leadership of Africa is the same as American leadership of South America. Both France and Italy regard their North African territories as extensions of their own territory. The Spanish national revolution also originated in the African territories. The French bombing of Gibraltar from Morocco and General Graziani's strategy in North Africa mark the beginning of a new era in Africa. Britain will be expelled from Africa. Spain will also recover Gibraltar, which was lost three hundred years ago. The British territories in Africa are not vital to Britain's survival, and Britain has not fully developed these territories. Britain advocates the "Open Door Policy" and argues that Germany will eliminate the natives to transplant the Germanic people. German officials have stated that Germany has no intention of colonizing and will develop the region with the assistance of the natives. (Haitong Telegram, 16th)</p>
<h3>Molotov Returns to the Soviet Capital; German Foreign Minister to Visit Rome</h3>
<p>Moscow, At midnight on the 15th, Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov, along with several comrades, returned here from Berlin. From Berlin to the border, Molotov was personally escorted by representatives of the German government, including Department Director Tembo, Liaison Officer Stein, Hitler's adjutant Hess, and naval representative Steifeses. Those who greeted Molotov at the station included Soviet dignitaries Mikoyan, Kaganovich, Budyonny, Marshal Timoshenko, Chief of Staff Malizikov, and members of the diplomatic corps. The station was decorated with national flags, and the Red Army stood in formation to pay their respects. Those returning to the Soviet Union in the same train as Molotov included German Ambassador Schulenburg and the head of the German economic delegation to the Soviet Union, Schnarre. (TASS, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow, Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov recently telegraphed Hitler from the German-Soviet border to thank him, stating, "I am deeply grateful for the warm hospitality I received during my visit to your country. I hereby send my sincere thanks." Molotov also telegraphed German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, stating, "I am deeply touched by your gracious hospitality and send my sincere thanks." (TASS, 16th)</p>
<p>Basel, The Swiss Basler Zeitung reported that political and diplomatic circles in Rome expect German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to visit the Italian capital soon, as Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to Berlin has made it necessary for Germany and Italy to continue exchanging views.

<h3>A Painful History of the European War (3): Three Protagonists in the French Tragedy; (1) Daladier, Outwardly Strong But Inwardly Weak</h3>
<p>I further stated: "If you personally pen a letter, rather than have someone else do it, King Leopold will undoubtedly feel gratified, thus fostering a positive impression. In this precarious environment, I shall personally deliver this letter. You surely recall that he entrusted me with tasks last year. Such an approach is certain to inspire him. We must endeavor to handle all matters in this manner."</p>
<p>As we shook hands in farewell, Daladier replied, "Permit me to contemplate this further. I shall inform Courant (Acting Minister of Foreign Affairs) of my ultimate decision. You may consult with him at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs tomorrow."</p>
<p>The following day, Courant conveyed to me, "The Prime Minister has yet to reach a verdict. He suggests that we should not hasten. He stated in his own words, 'Let them (referring to the Belgians) stew a bit longer.'"</p>
<p>I could not bring myself to conclude the matter at this juncture. The peril involved was palpably immense. As I was unable to secure Daladier's endorsement through direct advocacy, I was compelled to resort to a strategy of circumvention. I resolved to visit Ponard, the Minister of Justice, Talbos, the Minister of Education and an old friend, and Reynaud, the Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>They almost unanimously asserted, "This is patently a matter of paramount import; it is manifestly unreasonable to keep King Leopold waiting in such a manner. Were we able to confer with Daladier again, it would be most advantageous; however, it appears to be rather cumbersome. He is exceedingly reluctant to have us inquire of him regarding matters of this nature until he has elucidated it to us. Why do you not consult with his confidante, such as Crabier (Daladier's Principal Private Secretary)?"</p>
<p>I therefore sought out Crabier. He comprehended my intention thoroughly and pledged his assistance. Nonetheless, it was not until three months thereafter that I returned to Brussels, and King Leopold remained without receipt of a letter from Daladier.</p>
<p>I could furnish copious elaborations regarding Daladier's conduct during the war years. However, given that it is extraneous to the matter I have just recounted, I shall refrain from doing so.</p>
<p>We may now inquire: "What fundamental values underpinned his governance? Into what manner of man had he transformed?"</p>
<p>In effect, he had become a dictator. He wielded all the vast powers of a dictator but achieved nothing of note. In spirit, he remained a democrat. I am firmly of the belief that his adoption of dictatorial methods was circumstantial and a temporary expedient. He hoped that on the day of France's victory, he could announce to the Parliament, "The French Republic and the triumph of human freedom have at last been attained. I am proud and believe that all past actions will be well-received by you all. Now I will retire."</p>
<p>Indeed, he was a dictator, but firstly, due to inherent flaws in his nature, his endeavors were ineffectual. He had not completely shed the trepidation stemming from the Sixth of February (the Paris riots), although in many instances, he had learned how to galvanize himself in the face of upheavals. He had rendered himself somewhat numb, repeatedly ruminating and pondering matters, delaying and procrastinating, hesitating and vacillating. And most egregiously, though nominally a dictator, in his conscience, he remained governed by democracy. This is, of course, his luminous aspect, and should not be withheld from mention. The multifarious oppositions arising from the dilatory democratic institutions converged upon him, rendering him helpless to extricate himself. On the one hand, he was unable to surmount the inertia of habit and various shortcomings. His lack of capacity to be likened to a genuine dictator stemmed from the fact that the innate goodness of a free people had not been extinguished within him, and he dared not drive free people as the tools of a tyrant.</p>
<p>Regrettably, while his capacity to be a genuine dictator was insufficient, he unwittingly acquired all the pernicious habits of dictators. He was ever suspicious of others, fond of solitude, and invariably persuaded that he was correct in all matters, that there was nothing in the world he did not understand. Those of steadfast character who dared to confront him directly and say, "You are mistaken," he most detested.</p>
<p>The most grave and intractable question is the following: "How did he perceive this war? Was it because he misjudged the situation that he ventured into it?"</p>
<p>A portion of this remains enigmatic, difficult to answer. However, I believe that within many mysteries, I can extract an answer to serve as a partial explanation.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, Daladier loathed war most vehemently. During the Great War, he enlisted as a private and fought in battle. An unshakeable conviction within his political ideology was this: "We must not once again involve the nation and its people in war as we did previously. We possess a superior understanding of the means to prevent war than our predecessors. If a war were to erupt despite our efforts, it would undoubtedly be because they did not loathe war as thoroughly as we do."</p>
<p>Until the fifteenth of March, 1939, he remained confident in his ability to handle all matters adeptly. This accounts for his lack of dissent regarding the Munich Conference. Subsequently, as our populace, clearly and overtly, demonstrated a willingness to sacrifice all in pursuit of war, he gradually came to realize that he possessed no art of preventing war. However, even at that juncture, he remained stubbornly attached to fleeting hopes, believing that a miracle might occur at the last moment.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of war, I venture to assert that the following notion must have been present within his mind: "It is truly unreasonable, yet who knows? Perhaps with the passage of time, the enemy will ultimately be defeated. We can defeat Germany through internal revolution within the enemy, or through their being exhausted, their economy or popular morale collapsing. Without much bloodshed, or even without any bloodshed, the whole world can once again savour the air of freedom."</p>
<p>To confront war with such a psychology, the outcome is predictable. As I declare this to the democratic nations of the world and to friends who cherish freedom and peace, my heart still aches.</p>
<p>Perhaps you might retort: "This explanation still fails to elucidate why Daladier, during his extensive tenure as Minister of National Defense, did not manufacture more aircraft and tanks. During the six months following the outbreak of war, he neglected to train troops, promote munitions manufacture, and adopt modern defense strategies modeled after the invasions of Poland and Finland. He is undeniably culpable of dereliction of duty."</p>
<p>Assuredly, he cannot escape his culpability. His descent into habitual drunkenness during this period was not without cause. It is said that he frequently consumed alcohol to stimulate his energy, and that the alcohol he consumed became increasingly potent. This may well be true, but I surmise that this was not a decisive factor.</p>
<p>Others claim that he indulged in women - particularly his dalliances with the Marchioness de Crussol. I fear that Daladier squandered too much time and energy on this woman. The lascivious anecdotes regarding actresses that Daladier and I jested about at the Comédie-Française in 1926 had long since vanished. What I deem more lamentable is that a baker's son from Orange should, by engaging in an affair with a marchioness, willingly become a captive in the world of social climbing. In such a state, Daladier simply exposed his weaknesses and provided others with opportunities to exploit him, a matter for profound regret. However, in my view, this, too, is of secondary importance.</p>
<p>I believe that women and generals, when compared, are of vastly disparate weight, and a distinction can be made forthwith. Daladier, who had once been a leader of the Popular Front and vehemently opposed war and militarists, gradually transformed into a loyal servant of the military. Overcome with frustration and resentment in the wake of defeat, he confined himself within the desolate-seeming Ministry of War, where he was in constant contact with boisterous military men. He heard only the voices of officers. He found them amenable and endearing, unlike the criticisms levelled against him by public opinion. The voices of these officers were measured, prudent, even ingratiating, with every word and expression conveying respect, longing, and adoration. Daladier was simply narcotized by them. (End)</p>

<p>continued dropping high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. Residences, shops, and factories suffered considerable damage. Fires broke out in some areas but were quickly extinguished. Casualties among the population were minimal. There was little German aircraft activity in other areas, and damage and casualties were minor. Yesterday, another enemy fighter plane was shot down. Two enemy bombers were destroyed during the night raid on London. Therefore, the total number of enemy aircraft shot down yesterday was twenty. Two British fighter planes went missing, but the pilots were safely rescued. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>London, Coventry, an ancient city and aircraft manufacturing center in England, and its surrounding areas were bombed by German planes last night, causing at least a thousand casualties. Extensive damage occurred everywhere. The sight was one of terrifying ruins. Rescue teams and firefighters are working hard to restore order on the surface. This ancient city in the Midlands, historically known for the legend of Lady Godiva riding a horse, is now desolate and filled with ashes after the disaster. It is estimated that 500 German planes participated in the air raid, bombing for ten and a half hours, dropping thousands of bombs. Although the area of destruction is vast, officials still claim that the damage to major military factories is minimal. The Aviation Ministry announced that British anti-aircraft fire prevented German planes from accurately bombing large aircraft engine factories and other factories. This air raid is the most devastating disaster that England has suffered. Tens of thousands of Coventry's 167,000 residents are now homeless, wandering aimlessly in streets filled with bomb craters, a pitiful sight. Charity workers from all areas around Coventry were mobilized to move most of the city's homeless residents out of the city. This "man-made earthquake from the sky" destroyed four crowded public air-raid shelters, as well as hospitals, hotels, theaters, churches, shops, clubs, schools, and other buildings. The majestic St. Michael's Cathedral, a medieval building, was also destroyed in this catastrophe. (International, 16th)</p>
<p>Coventry, After the German bombing of Coventry, a city located in the center of England, this Thursday night, the city is scarred and scarred, and only the spire of Coventry Cathedral still stands tall, as if on duty to guard the desolate scene. From dusk to dawn that night, there were few times when the sound of bombs falling to the ground was not heard for more than two minutes. Twenty-five or more enemy planes launched air strikes in turns in the first six hours of the attack, dropping hundreds of various bombs over a wide area. The moonlight was very bright, so in addition to burning bombs, enemy planes also dropped flares, so the whole city was in a red light. The land's anti-aircraft guns fired incessantly, and the enemy planes flew very high in the sky and could not drop bombs accurately. The enemy planes flew away after a night of mad attacks. At that time, several fires had not been completely extinguished. British Home Secretary Morrison visited the disaster area yesterday and was deeply moved by the courage and cheerful spirit of the residents in the face of such hardship. Most shops did not open for business today. Twelve incendiary bombs fell on Coventry Cathedral. Dean Howard led the crowd to put out the fire, but the second batch of incendiary bombs fell like rain, aided by bombs. The dean was helpless and the whole church was destroyed, leaving only the spire standing tall. The church was built in the 14th century and is one of the most precious models of stereoscopic architecture in England. The spire rises 300 feet, and all of its 15th-century glass had been moved to a safe place some time ago. In addition to the church, three other churches and a library with a rich collection of books were also destroyed. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin, The German side claimed that 500 German planes dropped 1,000 kilograms (one ton) of bombs each on the British city of Coventry on Thursday night, for a total of 500,000 kilograms of explosive bombs and 300,000 kilograms of incendiary bombs. Therefore, British aircraft manufacturing has suffered a fatal blow, as the large and small aircraft factories in Coventry no longer exist. Hitler's air force also attacked other cities in the British Midlands, hitting ammunition factories, gas plants, and a British air force supply depot. Three bombs hit Dover Wireless Station. Twenty British planes were shot down in the operation, and five German planes did not return. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Military Report</h3>
<p>Berlin, The German military report this afternoon stated that the German air force bombed London and many important cities in central and southern England again yesterday. A German long-range reconnaissance plane attacked a British convoy 700 kilometers from Ireland. Although the escorting destroyers fired anti-aircraft guns continuously, two cargo ships (9,300 tons and 16,000 tons) caught fire. As a result of British air raids on Germany last night, buildings in German shipyards were damaged, and a hospital was hit by a bomb. Losses elsewhere were minimal, with only a few casualties. In total, as a result of yesterday's air combat, German destroyers shot down seven British planes. German anti-aircraft guns shot down nine British planes last night. Six German planes went missing.

<h3>Rice Market Completely Speculative; No Longer Based on Actual Arrivals, Inventory, and Sales; Parasitic Merchants and Speculative Households Stir Up Trouble</h3>
<p>The price of foreign rice fluctuated yesterday, but with more buying than selling, the market price continued to rise. Based on inventory sources and actual sales, the market should have fallen yesterday, but the rice market has long been in a speculative atmosphere, completely manipulated by hoarding merchants and rice parasites. In the early morning market, the situation was still flat. Because of the rebound after yesterday afternoon's rise, people were inevitably wary, and many wanted to sell their profitable goods at a high price. Therefore, there was more selling than buying, and prices fell slightly. However, after this short decline, general speculative merchants and rice parasites took the opportunity to become active again. The situation suddenly became lively again. Speculative households, unaware of the underlying causes, echoed the trend and blindly followed suit. As a result, the market turned from weak to tight, and prices rose steadily. The market was pushed higher and higher. The morning close was up by one yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to rise by 70-80 cents. At the late close, it returned to a flat 50-60 cents. As a result, it was still a bit higher than the previous evening. However, the spot price of some rice was only slightly higher by 30-50 cents. The market was chaotic and inconsistent. The price of Red Real Pagoda No. 2 rice opened at 69 yuan, fell to 68.60 yuan, and then gradually rose to 69.50 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, it once rose to 70.02 yuan, closing at 69.70-80 yuan. KG spleen was 67-8 yuan in the morning, 68.8 yuan in the afternoon, and still only 68 yuan at the close. Saigon spot of Round-trip No. 1 was 86.8 yuan, extra high 88.5 yuan, November 82.5 yuan, December 81 yuan. Round-trip No. 2 spot was 83.5 yuan, November opened 78.5 yuan to 80 yuan in the morning, up to 70.09 yuan in the afternoon, and closed at 70.05 yuan. December opened 76.3 yuan to 77 yuan in the morning, up to 78 yuan in the afternoon, and fell slightly by 30-50 cents, with a lack of buyers. Market prices fluctuated inconsistently, completely due to manipulative behavior. However, the issue of sellers raising prices for pre-orders was confirmed by continued transactions. New transactions included 1,000 tons of small fine rice sold by the Rixing Company for 75.8 yuan. The total volume of rice traded throughout the day was over 10,000 bags. Over 1,000 tons of original packaged rice were also returned.</p>
<p>As for price stabilization, despite various publicity campaigns in newspapers, the reality is different. It is rumored that no action will be taken until the rice price rises to a level that satisfies the expectations of rice merchants and speculators. Therefore, the chaos in the rice market is due to this, and the stability of rice prices is unlikely. As for the addition of a certain percentage of interest, if calculated based on the current purchase price, the interest earned by rice merchants and speculators is immeasurably high. What they excel at is creating smoke and mirrors, spreading rumors, deceiving the world, stealing names, and grabbing extraordinary profits.</p>
<p>New Japonica rice, green rice, wild rice, and other arrivals continued to total over a thousand shi, and retail sales were still brisk. Therefore, the market has repeatedly increased. Yesterday, new Japonica original package opened at 93 yuan, 90 yuan, 89.50 yuan per hu, 87 yuan, wild rice 93 yuan, 90 yuan, green rice original package 90 yuan, 87 yuan per hu, and Dujian 77-8 yuan per hu.</p>
<p>Over a thousand bags of Hong Kong glutinous rice arrived in port. Only a small amount of local glutinous rice was available on the market. Therefore, the local glutinous rice market was better, rising by about one yuan. The price of foreign glutinous rice was similar. Yili white opened at 84 yuan, Chang Dan white 82-3 yuan, Hong Kong 76-74 yuan, and Nuo Cha was reduced from 66 yuan to 64 yuan.</p>
<p>The number of corn shipped from places such as the West and Real Estate was small, and sales in the local port were limited. Yesterday, 1,000 bags were shipped to Weihaiwei and 2,000 bags to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Newly Arrived Foreign Flour Already Being Traded</h3>
<p>The flour market was mediocre yesterday. The price of No. 1 flour from the factory remained at 17 yuan, and the market price was 18.5 yuan, unchanged for the time being. Fuxin and Fufu factories sold over 8,000 bags of the old Car Fuxin brand. The newly arrived foreign flour has also been traded, with local merchants taking over 3,000 bags. Because the quality of the goods is not very high, the price is between 18.5 yuan and 70 cents. It is said that new batches of flour are constantly arriving, so it is difficult to expect the market to improve. Transactions for return and foreign flour were quiet, with no agreements reached for the time being.</p>
<p>The wheat market remained scarce in both supply and demand. The amount of wheat in the market was small, especially the amount of wheat stored in concessions. The selling price was 26-7 yuan. It is said that recent arrivals were all directly delivered to factories, so market transactions remained quiet.</p>
<h3>Financial Commentary – November 16th – The Future of the Bank of Japan's Issuance – Saint Keyes</h3>
<p>The financial commentary in July discussed the inflation of the Japanese currency system and, compared the banknotes of the three major Japanese banks with the currency system at the end of June this year, explaining the inflationary situation. Until recently, it has been difficult to collect all the issuance figures of the Japanese currency system at the end of September, and we will analyze them in the future. However, recent reports from Tokyo, when combined, reveal that the issuance of Bank of Japan banknotes is heading towards a terrible and extremely vicious inflationary path. There is no need to investigate the entire Japanese currency system to find this out.</p>
<p>First, the amount of Bank of Japan banknotes issued has been hovering around 330 million yen for some time. In September of this year, it was still 330.3 million yen, but on October 1st, it increased to 350.79 million yen. On the 11th, it decreased to 340.36 million yen, but by the end of the month, it increased again to 370.53 million yen, creating the highest record in Japanese financial history. Although the issuance amount for this month is unknown, judging from this fluctuating trend, if it continues unchanged, it is very likely to break the record again.</p>
<p>Secondly, at the National Financial Discussion Conference, Bank of Japan Governor Yuki stated, regarding the gold issue: The function of gold as the basis for domestic currency has lost its importance, while the function of gold as a means of settling international payments will become increasingly important in the future due to changes in internal and external situations. There is a general argument that the Bank of Japan's convertible note issuance system should be re-examined. This means that the Bank of Japan's note issuance amount will inevitably increase its inflation rate further by the end of the year. Therefore, there is a general argument that, in order to adopt the highest issuance system and other possible currency management measures, the issuance system must be fundamentally reformed. Since major countries around the world have abandoned the gold standard, severing the relationship between gold and prices, the Bank of Japan's reserves are considered no longer important domestically. Part or even all of the gold reserves can be rolled over into the exchange fund to expand exchange sales. In the future, the goal will be to revise the exchange regulations and reform the issuance system.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan's vicious inflation has already been proven as a fact. At the same time, the Bank of Japan Governor is well aware that the end of this year will inevitably lead to an extreme and vicious situation. Therefore, at a time when the Nazis claim that gold is useless, they want to fundamentally reform the issuance system and transfer the questionable cash issuance reserves to the exchange fund. Transferring this questionable gold reserve, worth 500 million yen, to the exchange fund would of course be beneficial for Japan in terms of foreign exchange and trade, for lacking foreign exchange support and increasing the purchasing power of military supplies, from the perspective of strengthening aggressive actions. However, how to fundamentally reform the issuance system by using the highest issuance system and other possible currency management measures is worth examining. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Exchange Market Dominated by Rumors</h3>
<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed prices did not fluctuate. The black market for British and American exchange rates suddenly tightened again, with uncertain trends. Even operators found it difficult to predict. Halfway through the day, initially, speculators broadly offered over a hundred thousand US dollars, causing the price to reach 5.96875 yuan. It was difficult to sell, and British exchange banks did some trading at 3 pence 8125. At that time, foreign banks were rarely active, with only some British gold merchants releasing Indian exchange. Around 11:15, rumors spread that a certain party had intentions towards a certain court and the issuance of treasury bonds, all baseless rumors. As a result, people believed there was a profit motive, stopped selling, and started buying. Hong Kong telegram speculators were the most active. As a result, the British gold closed at 3 pence 75 and the US exchange rate at 5.875 yuan, which was 0.03125 tighter than the previous British and 0.0625 tighter than the American.</p>
<p>Sharp Tightening at Noon</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large strips, both near and forward months, fell by 0.0625. New York silver prices remained flat. London gold remained stable. Exchange rates remained unchanged between the UK and the US, increasing by 25 to Shanghai, and unchanged between the US and the UK, increasing by 7 points to Shanghai. The central government's listed rates remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, with British gold at 3 pence 78125 and US exchange at 5.9375 yuan, which was flat compared to the previous day's late close for both British and American exchange rates. After opening, the market was slightly firm. It was reported that a foreign bank made an initial offer of British currency at 3 pence 8125. Also, Huaxing did an interbank trade of US exchange for this month at 5.96875 yuan. The silver equalization tax was announced and fell by 0.025. After that, it temporarily stabilized. However, around 11:00, speculators and Hong Kong telegrams came to buy, and the underlying trend tightened. It was reported that spot US exchange for speculators and others entering foreign banks reached 5.9379 to 90625 yuan. At the same time, Hong Kong telegrams settled British currency into foreign banks at 3 pence 75. By noon, foreign banks offered spot US exchange at 5.90625 yuan, but it was difficult to settle before closing. As a result, British gold, both spot and futures, closed at 3 pence 75, and US exchange at 5.875 yuan. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday. Compared to the previous day's close, the British gold spot rate was reduced by 0.03125, December softened by 0.015625, and the US exchange rate was uniformly tighter by 0.0625.</p>
<p>British and American Rates Unchanged in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 16th (Saturday) Electric Dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning. British and American exchange rates remained unchanged. Shanghai exchange rate dropped by 2.5 yuan to 393 yuan. At 11:30, it reported flat, Shanghai exchange rate rose by 2.5 yuan, remaining at 395.5 yuan. The rest remained unchanged. There is no market on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rates Continue to Rise</p>
<p>Tianjin, 16th (Saturday) Electric Dispatch: The exchange market opened loose this morning. London Telegraphic Transfer still opened at 3 pence 875, New York Telegraphic Transfer firmed by 0.0625 to 6.125 yuan. Shanghai Exchange fell by 1.5 yuan to 96.5 yuan. The black market for "Joint Notes" also rose by 0.4 yuan to 82.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Affected Equally by the Exchange Market: Gold Prices Rebound, Breaching the 5,700 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the black market for refined gold, the initial trading was sluggish. However, at noon, there was a sudden surge. Amidst dual rumors, prices broke through the 5,700 Yuan mark. The foreign exchange market reported tight conditions, stirring up excitement among various parties. The morning opened rather flat at 5,650 Yuan. Due to a slight easing in foreign exchange, small money shops eagerly covered their short positions, while silver firms released substantial amounts, causing the price to briefly dip to 5,640 Yuan. However, around 11:15 am, rumors about treasury bonds and court issues surfaced, tightening the foreign exchange market amidst speculative buying. Exchange brokers re-entered the market, and gold firms scrambled to buy, pushing the price up to 5,710 Yuan, eventually settling at 5,708 Yuan, a rebound of 58 Yuan. The half-day trading volume totaled 4,000 taels. In the afternoon, due to the Saturday closure, the spot price was nearly 10 Yuan lower than the forward price. Swaps saw buyers offering a discount to sellers, dropping from 13 Yuan to 10 Yuan. Gold ornaments rose by 10 Yuan, reaching 590 Yuan. Customs gold and other items remained stable.</p>
<p>Refined Gold Rises by 58 Yuan</p>
<p>The morning opened with a stable-to-firm exchange market, making it difficult for gold prices to rise. Silver firms offered securities at 5,650 Yuan for 10 taels. Gold firms then exerted pressure, offering 30 taels of securities at 5,645 Yuan. At this point, cash shops began buying, slightly improving prices. Cash shops took 20 taels from gold firms at 5,679 Yuan. Later, securities firms and silver firms leaned towards selling, causing a sharp drop to 5,640 Yuan. However, as the foreign exchange market gradually softened and positive news spread, gold firms and silver firms aggressively searched for gold, soon pushing prices past the 5,700 Yuan mark. Gold firms took 20 taels from securities firms at 5,705 Yuan, and another 30 taels from silver firms at 5,700 Yuan. The highest price seen by silver firms trading with each other reached 5,710 Yuan. By the noon closing, cash shops were selling 20 taels to silver firms at 5,708 Yuan, a rise of 58 Yuan compared to yesterday's closing. The price fluctuated by 70 Yuan during the half-day. Spot gold firms sold their own-brand gold at a price more than 10 Yuan higher than refined gold, and bought it back at 30 Yuan lower. Bids for standard gold were listed 50 to 60 Yuan lower than the listed price, with little activity.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Listed 10 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael at major silver shops was initially listed at 580 Yuan by both Datongxing and Xintongxing. At noon, it rose by 10 Yuan, reaching 590 Yuan. The buy-back price was reduced by 30 Yuan, it was said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw prices trending upward amidst various rumors. British and American gold pounds each rose by 2 Yuan. British gold drafts saw little trading, and market prices remained stagnant. American gold drafts initially retreated to 16.43 Yuan, but due to intense rumors about currency circulation, the black market for US dollars tightened suddenly. The price of American drafts rose as high as 16.75 Yuan in the afternoon, a jump of 0.25 Yuan compared to the previous day's closing. Hong Kong drafts rose by 0.03 Yuan. Japanese gold drafts initially rose and then fell, ending the evening at 1.53 Yuan. Korean drafts remained unchanged at 1.18 Yuan.</p>
<h3>Reducing Interest on Savings Accounts, Increasing Staff Allowances—Leisurely and Carefree</h3>
<p>The decision of banks to reduce interest on current accounts was originally intended to encourage depositors to consider fixed-term deposits, transforming savings into fixed investments to support domestic construction. However, the interest rate reductions by various banks have largely been diverted to operating expenses, such as increasing allowances for staff. While employees in various industries and businesses also receive allowances, none are as generous as those of bank employees. The measures adopted by various banks to increase staff allowances include providing allowances based on the Shanghai Municipal Council's cost-of-living index, calculated according to salary amount, and providing rice, coal, or housing subsidies based on the number of family members in Shanghai. It is reported that a certain banking association plans to collect information on allowance measures from various banks to formulate a unified approach for reference. It is often observed that bank employees tend to be condescending towards customers, forgetting that their livelihood indirectly comes from these very customers. (Shou)</p>
<h3>Gold Production Increases, Expected to Reach 350,000 Taels This Year</h3>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: According to news from Chinese gold mining authorities, gold production is expected to reach 350,000 taels by the end of December this year, a sevenfold increase compared to pre-war production levels. Ninety percent of this amount is derived from panning in gold-bearing sand. Additionally, two significant new gold sources were discovered this year, one in Huitong, Western Hunan, estimated to contain 100,000 taels, and another in Jiangjin County near Chongqing, estimated to contain 50,000 taels. Gold mining authorities have been established in the provinces of Xikang, Sichuan, Qinghai, Henan, and Hunan. Recently, agencies will also be established in Guangxi and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<h3>Banks in Beiping to Reduce Interest Rates</h3>
<p>Beiping Dispatch: Commercial banks are planning to reduce interest rates on current accounts, similar to the measures taken by banks in Shanghai, due to an increase in current deposits and limitations on their utilization. This interest rate reduction is expected to be implemented soon.</p>
<h3>Silver Bars Drop in Both Near and Distant Terms</h3>
<p>London, 15th: Silver bar market prices for both near and distant terms fell by 0.0625. Market conditions were flat with little trading. Prices stabilized after the market closed. The price of American silver was flat for both spot and forward. Indian silver in Bombay was down by one anna for both spot and forward. Market conditions were flat, with a total of 15 contracts traded.</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate and Discount Rate Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills tended to stabilize at 4 yuan per thousand, with an offer rate of 5 yuan, the same as the previous day. The Shanghai Money Dealers Association's interbank lending rate was one point lower. Both morning and afternoon markets were quoted at 6 points.</p>
<p>Oil Cakes</p>
<h3>Sluggish Actual Sales in the Oil Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to a lack of new stimuli, the oil market in Shanghai was quiet. Apart from distant-term crude oil being tightened by speculators by about a yuan, the remaining prices were ordinary and mostly unchanged. Trade in soybean oil was weak in both buying and selling. Yesterday, a total of 50 cases of Jiaozhou soybean oil were traded at a price of 76 yuan, 30 barrels of Dalian soybean oil at 111 yuan, 200 cases of Jiaozhou crude oil at 74.15 to 74.5 yuan, 50 barrels of Qingdao crude oil at 103.5 yuan, 200 barrels of November futures at 103 to 103.5 yuan, 800 barrels of December futures at 104.25 to 105.75 yuan, and 200 cans of Yantai canned crude oil at 106 yuan.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Physical Goods Flow Out, Public Bonds Have Difficulty Rising</h3>
<p>The security black market saw two price increases yesterday but remained weak overall. There were also rumors of treasury bonds being issued, but the market was clearly divided into bulls and bears, each with their own reasons. Observing the market trends, large investors continued to sell, and banks also saw a flow of physical goods. Based on these observations, it is difficult for market prices to rise. However, buyers also possessed considerable strength, which cannot be ignored. Before any official announcement is made, this financial fluctuation is likely to remain in a state of chaos. Yesterday morning, Shunchang continued to buy over 100,000 units, and Lianyi and Tongshun also purchased a significant amount. The market price of Category C shares reached 1.6 yuan again, but Tongkang continued to sell a large volume, and Xieda and Yitai also released shares, causing the market price to slowly decline, although to a lesser extent than the previous day. However, Category A shares remained firm. In the afternoon, Houda bought over 200,000 units, and Hongda also made substantial purchases. Other firms like Yongkang, Lianyi, and No. 35 also made purchases, but with Tongkang still selling heavily and Tongshun and Lianhe also selling quickly, the market price ultimately weakened. As a result, apart from Category A shares, which rose slightly by 0.05 yuan, the rest retreated by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated at 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 100 shares of stock exchange shares were traded at a price of 29 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Friday): Today, the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat, with no changes in prices.</p>
<h3>Ewo Yarns Declares Dividend and Will Issue New Shares</h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd., manager of the Ewo Cotton Mills, Ltd., announced that the gross profit for the first half of this year (ending June) (including 1,229,597.33 yuan carried over from the previous period) totaled 10,901,031.97 yuan (depreciation and amortization not deducted). The board of directors decided to distribute an interim dividend of 1.5 yuan per share for this year, payable on December 9th. They will also issue 337,500 new shares, each with a face value of 5 taels of silver, at an issue price of 26 yuan. Existing shareholders are entitled to subscribe for one new share for every four old shares held. The subscription period for local shareholders ends on December 20th, with a slight extension for shareholders in other locations. It is understood that these new shares will have the same rights as the existing ordinary shares, and will be entitled to the same final dividend for this year.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cotton</p>
<h3>Raw Material Supply Unresolved, Yarn Factories Not Opening for Sale Soon, Shuangma Resumes Rising by 20 Yuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending upwards, and the bullish sentiment is strong. This is due to the continued and persistent demand for existing yarn from Hong Kong traders, as well as purchases of 20-count Shuangma yarn. This has boosted confidence, and short sellers are actively covering their positions in response to the improving environment, gradually pushing prices forward. Some say, why are the factories not opening for sale? In reality, the problem of raw material supply cannot be resolved quickly, so sales are temporarily impossible. Yesterday, 1,625 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The market for existing yarn opened with a moderate sentiment. The afternoon of the previous day had already turned positive, resulting in fewer sellers in the market. The initial bid price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,245 yuan. At the same time, prices for foreign cotton rose, attracting a larger number of bullish buyers. The price quickly rose to 1,255 yuan, but then eased slightly as the foreign exchange market opened quietly, with some profit-taking, retracing a few yuan to fluctuate between 1,247 and 1,248 yuan for a long time. Later, it was learned that actual sales to Guangdong traders were not weak, and prices rose again, closing at 1,262 yuan, a rise of 20 yuan. According to statistics, a total of 6,070 bales were traded during the half-day. Prices for 10-count Shuangma yarn rose by 20 yuan. The amount of yarn purchased by each trader group is listed below: Hong Kong: 1,170 bales, Local traders: 4,900 bales.</p>
<p>The sentiment for Shuangma yarn was particularly good in the afternoon. It is said that transactions at the Yarn and Fabric Exchange reached 1,266 yuan.</p>
<h3>Impasse in the Cotton Market Difficult to Break</h3>
<p>The situation for existing cotton is good. Recently, the mills' demand has not developed, so the sentiment is moderate. However, the bullish trend for foreign cotton continues, while the sources for local cotton are still not entirely smooth. The overall trend in the cotton market remains in a stalemate.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market has been particularly active recently, first due to purchases by speculators, then due to searches by traders. As a result, closing prices were 14 to 15 points higher compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, also rose by more than 3 rupees.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trade: Trading in Shanghai has remained extremely quiet recently. All parties are taking a wait-and-see approach. The mills are temporarily not interested in buying, while traders are unwilling to sell at low prices due to the difficulty in sourcing foreign cotton. As a result, there are no transactions between the two parties.</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<h3>Active Trade in Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>The cloth market opened flat yesterday morning but strengthened considerably in the afternoon. Trade on Wood Street and in retail outlets was active. Sales of cotton cloth priced in legal tender were mixed, with plain cloth remaining flat while fine cloth and twill rose by 0.25 yuan. Colored cloth and bleached cloth also saw slight fluctuations. Factory prices were 0.5 to 1 yuan higher per piece than spot goods. On this street, 800-odd pieces of grey cloth, flannelette, and bleached and dyed cloth were traded. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders handled 100-odd pieces of striped cloth, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. Zhejiang, Ningbo, and Yong traders handled 200-odd pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth. Overseas, Siamese and Singapore traders handled 5,000-6,000 pieces of striped cloth and bleached cloth. On the 16th, 1,410 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the East Piece Goods market turned firm. The closing price for fine cloth from the White Goods leader was 35.75 yuan, and for serge, 1.0925 yuan. In the afternoon, due to the market closing at six, the black market trade among traders rose again. Fine cloth such as Longtou traded at 36 yuan, and Sijunzi serge at 2.1 yuan, trending upward.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to weaken. The current prices for public chartering and existing goods were: Grade 2 Raw Sugar 72.5 yuan from the outer warehouse, Taikoo Granulated White B Mark 74.8 yuan from the western warehouse, down 0.2 yuan, 74.5 yuan from the eastern warehouse, DY Mark 69 yuan from the western warehouse, 68.8 yuan from the eastern warehouse, HX Mark 68.7 to 68.5 yuan from the eastern warehouse, and Dutch Red Sugar 55.9 to 56 yuan.</p>
<p>Metals</p>
<h3>Antimony Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The market for Antimony (i.e., the common term for domestically produced pure antimony) was generally attractive yesterday, because the remaining inventory was not high, and the sources from Hong Kong were not abundant. Therefore, the belief of manipulating the market by the traders came into being, causing the listed prices to rise again and again. Yesterday, the market price had risen to 8,600 yuan per ton, which was an increase of 200-300 yuan compared to the previous. However, the actual sales became sluggish because of the sharp increase in prices. The market was only seeing inquiries and quotations.</p>

<h3>Third U.S. Evacuation Ship: The Washington to Arrive in Shanghai Today; Despite its Size, the Ship Will Enter [the] Port; Expected to Depart on the 20th with Evacuees</h3>
<p>The U.S. government has advised its citizens in the Far East to evacuate and has dispatched special ships for transport. The first two ships, the "President McKinley" and the "President Pierce" of the [China] Mail Steamship Company, have already transported evacuees from Shanghai back to the U.S., as previously reported in this newspaper. According to an announcement yesterday by the United States Lines, the third special ship, the "Washington" postal ship, is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 3 PM today. Despite its large tonnage, it will enter the Huangpu River and is scheduled to dock at buoys 11 and 12. Crew members will disembark via small boats at the New Customs Wharf at 4:30 PM today. Approximately 900 people are planning to leave Shanghai on this ship. It will remain in Shanghai for three days and is scheduled to depart for the Philippines at 2 PM on the 20th. American evacuees in Shanghai are scheduled to board the ship in three groups on the morning of the 20th at 9 AM, 11 AM, and 12 PM via small boats departing from the New Customs Wharf. The United States Lines will remain open today to facilitate the exchange of formal tickets for the convenience of returning citizens.</p>
<p>American Women Reluctant to Part</p>
<p>Regarding the evacuation of a significant number of American citizens, according to a reporter's investigation, there are often conflicting opinions within families. Most men, for the sake of their wives' and children's safety, are willing to send their families back to the U.S. However, many women are unwilling to leave their husbands alone in China. Therefore, there is often reluctance to part. In addition, many women who have been in China for several years have just found a place to settle down. Once evacuated, they will lose all their jobs. Moreover, most of them do not know whether the government will fund their return to China after the situation calms down in the future.</p>
<p>Applications for Assistance Under Investigation</p>
<p>According to a staff member of the U.S. Consulate General, the applications for relief assistance from seven American citizens are still under investigation. Reportedly, two of them have been investigated and confirmed, and a total of five people, including their families, will be assisted by the government to return to the U.S. by ship next month or early next year. Another official from the consulate stated that they would process these applications as quickly as possible, but would not prioritize them over regular passengers.</p>
<p>Missionaries in a Dilemma Regarding Whether to Stay or Leave</p>
<p>Since the U.S. State Department in Washington issued a notice advising American citizens in the Far East to evacuate back to the U.S., American missionaries throughout China have been in a dilemma regarding this evacuation. The work of American missionaries in China is dedicated to lifelong service to the Christian faith. At the same time, they cannot turn a deaf ear to the U.S. government's advice. Therefore, the evacuation of American missionaries is not only a personal issue. If American missionaries evacuate in large numbers, the faith of many Christians in the East who believe in Jesus will inevitably be shaken. In addition, many Christians in the U.S. donate funds to enable missionaries to preach abroad. If the missionaries evacuate, it will certainly discourage donors. A certain church doctor has been unable to obtain the necessary medical supplies because he has to transport these supplies from the occupied areas to Free China. However, his profession is that of a church doctor; otherwise, he could evacuate back to the U.S.</p>
<p>Shipping Line Representatives Assisting with Evacuation</p>
<p>After American citizens in the Far East were ordered to evacuate, Royal Gordon, Hugh Robinson, and Wallen Well, representatives dispatched by the United States Lines to provide guidance in the Far East, departed from San Francisco on the 10th via Pan American Airways' "Honolulu Clipper" flying boat and arrived in Hong Kong to assist with the evacuation of American citizens in the Far East. Gordon also visited Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Far East Fleet, at the Manila Hotel in Manila to discuss everything.</p>
<h3>Safety Week to Begin Tomorrow; The Entire City Should Pay Attention to Maintain Traffic Order</h3>
<p>In view of the remarkable results achieved last year in promoting the "Safety First" campaign, the police authorities of the two foreign concessions in Shanghai, in order to further promote public awareness of traffic rules and reduce traffic accidents, have jointly launched the second "Safety First" campaign starting tomorrow. The various measures have been reported in previous newspapers. According to a person in charge of the Traffic Department, the number of deaths in traffic accidents has been greatly reduced since the implementation of the safety campaign last year. The results of this second campaign will certainly be better than before. However, as this concerns public welfare, it is hoped that the people of the city will not only assume the responsibility of promoting and publicizing the campaign during Safety Week, but also continue to pay attention to traffic rules and urge relatives and neighbors to act cautiously after the campaign. This will not only reduce the number of innocent deaths, but also improve social order.</p>
<h3>Another Japanese Soldier Shot Yesterday; Situation in Hongkou is Serious; Assailant Escaped into [the] Chinese Population; Japanese Blocked Traffic and Conducted a Major Search; Japanese Soldiers Shot at Chinese People in Two Locations Last Night and This Morning</h3>
<p>Recently, several assassinations of Japanese officers have occurred in the Japanese-controlled area of Hongkou. By the day before yesterday, the number had reached more than ten. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, another Japanese soldier was shot in the Hongkou area. He was hit by a bullet and seriously injured. At the time, a Japanese officer who witnessed the incident attempted to arrest the assailant, but the assailant fired another shot, preventing him from approaching. The assailant eventually escaped without a trace. After the incident, the Japanese side implemented strict security measures and conducted a large-scale search, causing great disturbance to residents. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Sergeant Again Ambushed</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 12:45 PM, a Japanese sergeant named Gon Tominaga was walking on Wusong Road in Hongkou. When he arrived in front of the Japanese Residents Association Club at No. 295 Peng Road, someone suddenly shot him in the back. Tominaga was hit by a bullet and immediately fell to the ground. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the assailant turned into a small alley on Peng Road and escaped. At the time, an employee of a Japanese shop witnessed the incident and quickly ran into the alley to arrest him. However, after only a few steps, the assailant turned around and fired another shot. The employee was frightened and did not dare to approach, allowing the assailant to escape. He then sent the injured soldier to the nearby Shinozaki Hospital for treatment. When the assailant fired the shot in return, a Chinese person was grazed by a stray bullet and was also sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Bridges Blockaded and Traffic Cut Off</p>
<p>After the incident, the Japanese immediately blockaded the Garden Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and all roads west of North Jiangxi Road. They also conducted a door-to-door search in the area where the incident occurred. Marines and military police patrolled North Jiangxi Road, Tiantong Road, Qipu Road, Wenzaoshi Road, Haining Road, and Bazilu Road. Japanese Marines armed with guns were stationed at the corners. Traffic was also temporarily cut off at the North Railway Station on the boundary road. After hearing the news, the Public Concession Police also dispatched a large number of armed Chinese and Western detectives to the Garden Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and Jiangxi Road Bridge to maintain order.</p>
<p>Many People Blocked and Unable to Pass</p>
<p>After the Japanese implemented security measures at 1:00 PM, traffic in the area was completely cut off. Even Japanese people who requested passage were not allowed. Those who went to the General Post Office to deliver letters were blocked from leaving. The staff of the General Post Office were also blocked. At one point, no fewer than 500 people were standing on the bridges. Chinese and Western children from schools within and outside the settlement were unable to return home and stood outside the barbed wire fence, not knowing whether to laugh or cry. Those who arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai-Hangzhou train sat on the ground at the station. Those who wanted to go to the railway station to catch a train had to turn back with their luggage. It was not until around 6:00 PM that the Japanese opened a gap on Haining Road and North Jiangxi Road, allowing only residents to enter and exit. All vehicles were blocked, and inspections were extremely strict. The security measures were not completely lifted in the other areas even late into the night.</p>
<p>Garden Bridge Opened Late into the Evening</p>
<p>It was not until around 8:40 PM that the Garden Bridge was opened for traffic. Pedestrians and vehicles could travel freely on Broadway Road and Ward Road. However, the traffic was still blocked in the area around the Wusong Road Triangle Vegetable Market and Hubei Road. As a result, hundreds of men and women were stationed at the Zha Pu Road Bridge, all wanting to demand that the bridge be opened.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Fired at Zha Pu Road Bridge</p>
<p>Japanese Marines stationed at the Zha Pu Road Bridge to maintain order fired several shots. A Chinese person was hit and fell to the ground, seriously injured. Later, the Japanese used a military vehicle to take him away, and his whereabouts are unknown. After hearing the news, the Central Fire Brigade quickly dispatched an ambulance, but it was stopped by the Japanese on Wusong Road and had to turn back. It is impossible to find out the casualties among the injured Chinese and where they were taken.</p>
<p>Worker Shot While Strolling Again</p>
<p>At approximately 0:30 AM this morning, Zhang Xiaodao (32 years old, from Tongzhou), a worker at the shooting range, was shot by Japanese soldiers while strolling under the Garden Bridge, hitting his left waist. He was seriously injured. An ambulance was called to the scene and took him to Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Money Guild Passes [Resolution] to Close on Saturday Afternoons</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Guild convened a provisional executive committee meeting at 2 PM yesterday, where it passed a resolution in principle to close on Saturday afternoons. The resolution will be officially announced for public information after coordination with the Shanghai Banking Association to finalize the holiday schedule for next year. The operating hours for the bank clearing house and the money guild will be decided together by both parties. The clearing will be moved to the morning every Saturday hereafter. It has been heard that holidays for next year will include: New Years 3 days; Spring Festival 3 days; Tomb Sweeping Day 3 days; Summer break 1 day; Semiannual closing of accounts 2 days; Confucius’ birthday 1 day; Autumn Festival 1 day; National Day 1 day; Sun Yat-sen’s birthday 1 day; and Yunnan Uprising memorial 1 day. The banks’ Spring Festival period coincides with the Shanghai Money Guild’s year end closing. If a date above should fall on a Sunday, then the holiday will be extended to the day immediately following the end of the holiday period.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents' Election Plan; Hopes of Success are Slim; Shanghai's Future Depends on U.S.-Japan Talks; Changing Election Laws is a Test</h3>
<p>According to The China Press, yesterday (the 15th), a well-informed source claimed that the Shanghai Japanese Residents Association planned to change the election rules for the Shanghai Municipal Council before the next annual ratepayers' meeting to benefit the Japanese side. This attempt has no major implications and is unlikely to succeed because the real issues affecting Shanghai's future are currently being resolved through diplomatic channels between Washington and Tokyo.</p>
<p>Prepared But Still Concerned</p>
<p>It has been seven months since the heated Council election was held this April. The next election is still five months away. The Japanese are currently watching the diplomatic developments, and the British and American groups are also waiting to see what the Japanese will do before forming an election committee. The Japanese side may decide that using elections to implement a "blitzkrieg" in the Public Concession will provoke the United States, and the Japanese do not want U.S.-Japan relations to worsen.</p>
<p>Currently Silent on the Matter</p>
<p>If the Japanese have no extravagant hopes and are satisfied with the existing two seats held by Japanese councilors next April, then there is no need for an election at all. It is expected that both sides will remain silent on the election issue. Last year, leading British citizens began preparing for the election in June, ultimately achieving victory. This year, although the Japanese side vowed to immediately prepare for a comeback in the election next April after their defeat in the election, there has been little or no preparation by the Japanese and the British-American groups to date.</p>
<p>British Strength Sufficient for Victory</p>
<p>It is rumored that some Japanese merchants have purchased land and houses in the Public Concession to increase their electoral strength. However, the strength of the British group is strong enough to suppress this challenge. The rumored attempt by the Japanese Residents Association to change the election law can be seen as a Japanese test to see what they can achieve in this regard. This depends largely on the extent to which Tokyo can proceed with the "New Order" program.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Continue Flat Price Rice Program with Strong Support; Rice Merchants Manipulating and Monopolizing Will Not Be Tolerated</h3>
<p>At the board meeting held on Wednesday morning, the Shanghai Municipal Council passed a resolution to continue the Flat Price Rice program. It is understood that the Council’s subsidized rice will sell out by the 19th of this month. Preparations are currently underway with the rice merchants to continue the program. Although the specific measures are still under discussion, the Shanghai Municipal Council has resolved to support its continuation with cash subsidies. The authorities of both Concessions are also paying close attention to the overall food supply in Shanghai. Responsible senior personnel stated emphatically that both authorities will not easily let go of the rice merchants who are manipulating, monopolizing, and hoarding. Once an investigation proves it, they will be severely punished in accordance with the regulations. In addition to the weekly reporting and verification of the rice stocks in each rice shop by the Rice Evaluation Committee, the evaluation committees of both authorities will also send staff to conduct periodic investigations for reference.</p>
<h3>Empress of Russia to Arrive in Shanghai Tomorrow; To Depart for the Philippines Immediately That Night</h3>
<p>The British-owned Jardine Matheson Shipping Company's Empress of Russia will arrive in Shanghai at approximately 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 18th) and berth at the Hongkou Gonghexiang Wharf. The ship sailed from Vancouver, Canada, via Honolulu, Yokohama, and Kobe, Japan, and is en route to Shanghai before proceeding to Hong Kong and Manila. The ship will not delay upon arriving in Shanghai at approximately 3:00 PM tomorrow, and will depart at 9:00 PM that night. The last tender for passengers will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 7:30 PM that evening.</p>
<p>President Taft Arrives Early in Shanghai</p>
<p>The American President Lines' President Taft postal ship, departing from the U.S., originally sailed directly to Hong Kong and Manila via Japan. Now returning from Manila, it is arriving in Shanghai via Hong Kong on its way back to the U.S. Originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th and return to the U.S. on the 21st, it is now heard that it may arrive early at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th, berthing at buoys 12 and 13. Passengers will disembark via small boat at 4:45 PM at the New Customs Wharf, remaining in Shanghai overnight and departing on the same day as the Washington, namely at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 20th, bound for Kobe and Yokohama, Japan, before returning to San Francisco via Honolulu. The last small boat for passengers will depart from the New Customs Wharf at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 20th.</p>
<h3>Various Public Organizations to Express Views on Telephone Price Increases; No Need for Price Increase at All; French Municipal Council Should Rectify</h3>
<p>Since the authorities provisionally set three principles for telephone price increases, the entire city has been surprised, unanimously believing that Shanghai Telephone Company's business has flourished after the war, and there is absolutely no need for a price increase. Now they are attempting to implement a huge price increase. If this measure is actually implemented, the price increase will amount to no less than double, setting a record for price increases in other public utilities. It will significantly hinder industrial and commercial operations. Currently, all parties hope that the French Municipal Council can still rectify this unreasonable price increase. It is also heard that various public organizations within the concession are deeply concerned about this matter and will express strong views.</p>
<h3>U.S. Consulate Still Awaiting Reply Regarding Protest Against Seizure of Dasheng; Japanese Side Studying Content of Protest; Rumor that Italian Ship PaoloIne Blocked Outside Songmen Port</h3>
<p>The U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai protested to the Japanese authorities a week ago regarding the seizure of the American ship Dasheng off the coast of Zhejiang. As of yesterday (the 16th), they were still awaiting a reply from the Japanese side. The Japanese Consulate General stated that they are still studying the U.S. protest and will promptly submit a written reply to U.S. officials. Furthermore, the Italian ship PaoloIne, sailing from Shanghai to Songmen, Zhejiang, on the 13th of this month, was reportedly blocked outside Songmen Port after the Japanese announced a blockade of five ports in Zhejiang, including Songmen, the following day, prohibiting ships from entering or leaving.

<h3>Fourth Dharma Talk by the Five Religions Society; Expounding the Essentials of Diligence; Explaining According to Buddhist Scriptures in Four Sections</h3>
<p>The Fourth Dharma Talk by the Five Religions Society was given by Pastor Xie Songsan on "The Similarities Between Christianity and Confucianism." His speech was featured in yesterday's newspaper. After Pastor Xie finished his speech, it was decided that Mr. Yang Zhongyi would speak on the fourth of the similar points between Confucianism and Buddhism, namely the fourth of the Six Paramitas (perfections): Virya Paramita. The name is translated from kun li ye po lo kun za mi in Sanskrit, Virya in Chinese is called diligence, which is an energetic practice without regression. That is, getting up at the crowing of the rooster, working diligently for good, and not resting day or night, diligently practicing without laziness. According to the Buddhist scriptures, it is explained in four sections:</p>
<p>Distinguishing Diligence and Laziness</p>
<p>The Bodhisattva's Conduct Sutra narrates the Buddha telling Ananda, "Laziness is the accumulation of all actions. Laziness at home leads to insufficient clothing and food, and the failure of industry. Laziness in monastic life makes it impossible to escape the suffering of birth and death. All things are achieved through diligence. Diligence at home leads to abundant clothing and food, and the expansion of industry. Diligence in monastic life leads to the completion of the path, until Buddhahood is attained. All are achieved through diligence." Diligence does not regress until Buddhahood is attained. This is diligent practice without fatigue. "Everyone can become a Yao or Shun." Alas, "skill comes from diligence and is wasted by play." Therefore, diligence and frugality build a family, and worry and toil build a nation. Pleasure and idleness are poison, and ease and extravagance destroy the body. "It is like building a mountain, not yet completed," stop I stop. "It is like leveling the ground, even covering a basket," progress I go. Such is the distinction between diligence and laziness.</p>
<p>The Principle of Diligence</p>
<p>Translated by the Jin Dynasty's Zhu Fahu, the Sutra of the Stages of Practice says, "The Buddha said, 'Seeing one's past lives, wandering back and forth in birth and death for countless kalpas, the accumulated bones exceed Mount Sumeru, the marrow smeared on the ground can cover the three thousand worlds, the blood shed is more than the rain that has fallen throughout ancient and modern times. Only by wanting to escape the suffering of birth and death, diligently day and night, seeking non-action.'" "The Master's nature and the Way of Heaven cannot be heard." The difficulty of hearing about the Great Overcoming is such. If there is hearing, "hearing the Way in the morning, one can die in the evening." The joy of hearing the Way is also such. Therefore, "upon hearing it, practice it." "Zilu, upon hearing something, was unable to practice it, fearing that he would hear something else." How can the Way be merely heard? The emphasis is on diligent practice, approaching benevolence. "The practice of benevolence comes from oneself." "If I desire benevolence, then benevolence arrives." Therefore, it is said, "Bearing a heavy burden and a long road, taking benevolence as one's own responsibility, is it not heavy? Ceasing only after death, is it not long?" Therefore, "the superior man does not depart from benevolence for the space of a single meal." If one's faith in the Way is not firm and one gives up halfway, Confucius rebukes them, saying, "Now you limit yourself." Therefore, one must be determined to love learning and uphold the Way unto death. Strive, strive, "Speak to him without laziness." Yan Yuan's "desire to stop is impossible," therefore "seeing his progress but not seeing his limit."</p>
<p>The Thought of Diligence</p>
<p>The Sutra of the Substantial Seed says, "Diligence has ten thoughts. The Bodhisattva, thinking of these ten thoughts, has three real merits and focuses on them without confusion. This is called Right Mindfulness Diligence." "Mad thoughts can overcome the sage." The impossibility of stopping thought is such. Therefore, it is said, "Think of this, think of this." "Keep it in your heart, how can you forget it?" Think of it, think of it, and think of it again. "If you think of it and cannot attain it, do not give up." It is not that ghosts and spirits communicate it. The bright virtue of our heart illuminates itself.</p>
<p>The Method of Diligence</p>
<p>The Tang Dynasty's Prajna-traya translated the Sutra of the Great Vehicle's Six Paramitas, saying, "There are four kinds of diligence, possessing complete wisdom. What are the four? First, diligence in much learning; second, diligence in upholding; third, diligence in joyful speaking; fourth, diligence in right practice." Diligence begins with much learning. "Learn much, choose the good and follow it, see much and recognize it." Hear much and speak carefully, see much and act carefully. "Then much learning is beneficial." Next, one must be able to uphold "with single-mindedness" and "unchanging until death." "Choose the mean and obtain one goodness, then hold it firmly and do not lose it." "Those who are seen to be consistent can be relied upon." Therefore, "the superior man follows the Way and acts." Confucius had the lament "I cannot stop," next one must be happy to speak. "Those who know it are not as good as those who love it, and those who love it are not as good as those who delight in it." King Wen's virtue is pure, "pure and unceasing." Confucius was benevolent and wise, both sage, never weary of doing it, never tired of teaching people. Finally, right practice, "those who are sincere choose goodness and hold fast to it," and should "practice it diligently. If you practice it and cannot attain it, do not give up. Not only do not give up, but if others can do it once, do it a hundred times; if others can do it ten times, do it a thousand times. The Doctrine of the Mean's "utmost sincerity is unceasing," The I Ching's "self-strengthening unceasing," The I Ching's "the movement of Heaven is strong," "the flow of passing water."</p>

<h3>London Residents Not Afraid of Air Raids</h3>
<p>A prominent British citizen in Shanghai recently received a letter from London, stating that the Soviet military newspaper Red Star recently published an editorial stating that Germany's aerial offensive against Britain has clearly failed. Today, Britain's strength is not only sufficient to defend its homeland, but it is also carrying out effective air raids against Germany. London has suffered considerable losses from continuous attacks by German aircraft, but the air defense facilities there are thorough, and all industries and other activities continue without hindrance.</p>
<h3>Moufu Food Supplies Exhausted; Rumors of Seizure of Jiangding Along with the Merli</h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson Line’s Moufu, seized by a Japanese naval vessel off the Zhejiang coast earlier this month, has not yet been released. Passengers and crew remain held aboard. Yesterday, a telegram arrived in Shanghai from the ship reporting that, with the exception of the mail already retrieved, none of the remaining cargo could be moved. Currently, passengers and crew are suffering from hunger and cold due to the exhaustion of food supplies. In addition to requesting assistance from Zhoushan, the company authorities were urged to provide assistance urgently. After receiving the telegram, the shipping department of the Moufu dispatched personnel yesterday to Zhoushan on a Japanese ship with funds to provide assistance. At the same time, the German consulate was informed of the situation again to negotiate with the Japanese for their release, to ensure the safety of the passengers. As for the German merchant Rulun Yanghang’s Feikang and the American merchant Dasheng, they are still being held off the coast of Zhoushan. Each company has sent telegrams of inquiry, but all have been returned, and it is expected that the radio station is also being monitored by the Japanese, preventing any communication. It has also been heard that the Italian merchant Douli was also detained by a Japanese warship off Songmen, but the company has no confirmed information. It is rumored that the Jiangding and the Merli were seized at the same time.</p>

<h3>Two Robbers Shot and Captured</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at 4:41, as dawn was breaking, a man traveling by rickshaw passed the entrance of Lane 687, Machen Road, when he was suddenly accosted by five robbers. Two of them, armed with handguns, stepped forward, threatening him. They robbed the man of 40 yuan in cash and fled. Afterwards, the victim shouted "robbery" from the rickshaw. Patrol officers No. 2028 and No. 2101 from the Gordon Road Police Station happened to pass by. Upon hearing the alarm, they immediately went forward to arrest the robbers. The robbers immediately opened fire to resist arrest. The police returned fire, and a fierce struggle ensued. As a result, both robbers were shot and fell to the ground, where they were captured. One robber, Zhang Xiaosan (21 years old), sustained a chest wound from a bullet, which was very serious. The other robber, Yan Lifa (38 years old), sustained a leg wound. Afterwards, they were sent by car to the police hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Robbers Arrested, Eventually Caught</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening at 8:45, three robbers, two armed with handguns, robbed a woman of a gold thread ring at Lane 250, Da Tong Road. Afterwards, the victim shouted "robbery" and chased them out of the lane. Officer No. 264 of the Chinese police heard the alarm and pursued the robbers. The robbers opened fire to resist arrest, and the officer also returned fire. More than ten shots were exchanged. As the two robbers fled to the front of the Xinhai Grand Theater on Chibang Bridge, Xinzha Road, Officer Ellis, No. 77 of the Xinzha Police Station, was leading two Chinese police officers in searching pedestrians nearby. Upon hearing the gunshots and seeing the men running, he bravely stepped forward and apprehended one of the criminals. A handgun was found on the spot, with only one bullet remaining. He was taken to the police station for investigation. As bullets flew, a rickshaw puller named Ji Yuben (33 years old, from Taizhou, residing at No. 233, Changping Road) was shot in the left foot and sent to Doulong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Incompetent Doctor Performing Abortion, Arrested and Awaiting Investigation</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhu, a woman from Shaoxing, and her husband, Zhou Zigao, both worked as servants in Westerners' homes. Recently, Zhou became pregnant for four months, and fearing it would affect her work, she went to Yao Weikun, a Shaoxing pediatrician at No. 84, Xinkang Lane, Connaught Road, on the 23rd of last month for an abortion, through the introduction of a young woman. At that time, Yao gave her a piece of "King Kong Mustard Herb," instructing her to insert it into her lower body at home. Zhou first paid a fee of sixteen yuan. She followed the instructions at home, and the fetus was aborted on the 25th. However, she continued to experience abdominal pain and bleeding. Her employer noticed this and sent her to Renji Hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Zhou's temperature was high in the hospital. Despite surgery, it did not subside. Her employer reported this to the General Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest Yao Weikun. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi requested that Yao be detained pending investigation and prosecution on charges of abortion. Zhou is currently unable to appear in court due to her condition in the hospital and requested a postponement. Judge Xiao, after reporting, ordered that Yao Weikun and others be allowed to be detained and the hearing postponed.</p>

<p>Weekly Supplement</p>
<h3>The Trend of US Embargo Against Japan</h3>
<p>The United States has been patient with Japan for three years, and now it has taken an embargo action. This action is tantamount to a strong notification to the Japanese industrial community that, from now on, Japan will need to find other sources for 90% of its scrap steel and iron.</p>
<p>But this blow, though extremely fierce to Japanese industry, is not as indicated by the large-print headlines of some newspapers that the US supply of steel to Japan is completely cut off from now on. Outside the current embargo, some similar goods, such as alloys and semi-finished steel, continue to be supplied to Japan for large-scale consumption by its army. This pure steel, though smaller in quantity than the large amounts of scrap steel flowing into Japan, is simpler in procedure for the manufacture of munitions.</p>
<p>In the past year, Japan purchased $32,592,500 worth of steel scrap from the United States, accounting for 90% of its total steel imports. At the same time, Japan also purchased $5,958,739 worth of alloys from the United States, accounting for 98.51% of its total imports of this item, and $4,228,271 worth of semi-finished steel, accounting for 32.53% of its total imports of this item.</p>
<p>The value of steel scrap purchased by Japan from the United States last year was more than three times the total value of alloys and semi-finished steel. On the other hand, Japan was able to purchase from Europe for a long period last year, until the outbreak of the Second European War in early September, after which Japan's reliance on the United States to supply alloys and steel increased.</p>
<p>As for the 1938 trade, the value of refined steel supplied to Japan by the United States was $11,251,804. While the development of domestic industry in Japan was sufficient to reduce the country's imports of this steel from the United States in 1939, the continued import of metalworking machinery by Japan proves that Japan has not yet achieved self-sufficiency in this regard.</p>
<p>American economists are particularly interested in Japan's continued and constant imports of metalworking machinery from the United States, considering it a clear indication that Japan still needs to import large quantities of industrial machinery for the technological basis of modern industry and military power.</p>
<p>According to experts, this is the weakness of Japanese industry. If the supply of all machinery and production tools to Japan were stopped, it would be detrimental to Japan, whether it continued its war against China or manufactured goods for export in order to earn foreign exchange. If an embargo on this machinery were implemented, its impact on the Japanese economy would certainly be greater than that of an embargo on steel scrap and gasoline.</p>
<p>The United States is stepping up industrial mobilization to replenish its own military equipment and to assist Britain. Under these circumstances, many US officials believe that the complete cessation of exports of factory machinery and production tools by the United States, except to the Western Hemisphere and Britain, will sooner or later be realized. According to a recent report from the US Department of Commerce, US exports of machinery to Britain increased by 60% in the first eight months of this year, which already proves that these exports have shifted from Japan to other countries.</p>
<p>Further embargoes against Japan would necessarily include automobiles and trucks, which accounted for more than 76% of the quantity supplied by the United States to Japan last year. Some American automobile manufacturers have already freed up some of their machinery to manufacture aircraft engines and tanks, two military equipment needs that Britain is very keen on, and Japan will be unable to purchase American vehicles even without the opposition of the US State Department.</p>
<p>Therefore, apart from the initial moral ban on the export of aircraft and the subsequent embargo on the export of gasoline used for aircraft, the United States has taken a further step in prohibiting the export of military supplies to Japan. The embargo on steel scrap is extremely important, but the export of alloys and semi-finished steel has not yet been blocked. The result of the tripartite alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan may completely close this door. (Translated from a Washington dispatch from the Christian Science Monitor)</p>

<h3>Gandhi, Old But Strong</h3>
<p>— EL</p>
<p>Gandhi, as a 70-year-old elder, is still the most active leader in India in this era of great change, with the flames of war raging in Europe and crises lurking in India. Because of his age, this elder's personal life and all his actions cannot but be subject to the dictates of nature. The wrinkles on his face have increased more than before, and his sleep time is longer than in the past. He has also eliminated hard-shelled fruits and other things that are not easy to chew. What is surprising is that his habit of getting up early remains the same as before. He gets up at four o'clock every morning to participate in group prayers without fail. In fact, his most precious thinking and writing work of the day is done in these two hours of the morning. After the prayer, he goes back to sleep until he wakes up at dawn. He gets up to eat a simple breakfast, such as sheep's milk and fruit, and then walks a mile as a form of exercise.</p>
<p>Gandhi likes massages and enjoys sunbathing in winter. His skin is exceptionally smooth and clean, which is always surprising to visitors. In fact, every morning, he spends more than an hour slowly massaging tea oil, which makes it easy for him to get a good night's sleep.</p>
<p>His daily work has a fixed routine, with no room for any disruption. He has a meal at 11:00 AM, eating some sheep's milk, fruit, raw or steamed vegetables, and crispy homemade yellow bread. At noon, especially in summer, he always rests for one or two hours. At this time, his secretaries sort and file all incoming and outgoing correspondence. Items requiring his personal review and reply are placed on his desk.</p>
<p>From the afternoon until five o'clock, he receives guests or discusses important matters. Before the sun sets, he has dinner. The food is similar to the morning, but the portion is smaller. After dinner, he writes letters or selects articles for newspapers until 7:00 PM when he begins his evening prayers. Then, just like in the morning, he takes a walk for about half an hour and goes to bed at nine o'clock.</p>
<p>He lives in "Sevagram" - meaning "Village of Service" - to handle all official business. He is surrounded by many of his disciples, but political figures are rarely seen. He is interested not in politics but in the people's livelihood issues, such as how to develop the countryside, abolish class divisions, promote a new rural education system, and improve the food of the poor. He has to carefully study and review all these things, which takes more effort than politics.</p>
<p>Gandhi's concern is of course the freedom of India, but his approach is not like the single political approach of the Indian National Congress. He is passionate about two principles: non-violence and truth-telling. Gandhi hates violent aggression the most. Since the war began last year, he has been tormented by his worries. Moreover, in the last two years, influential members of the Indian National Congress have expressed opposition to Gandhi's doctrine and want to take opposing actions. But Gandhi has great perseverance and outstanding insight. Since last September, he has been acting according to what he advocates. Knowing that Hitler's aggression will endanger world stability and human civilization, he has expressed unconditional support for Britain and France. As for India's achievement of liberation and reconstruction, he believes that it is only a matter of time. However, after meeting with the Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, he said: "If Britain and France are defeated, or Germany is destroyed, what will be the value of India's hoped-for liberation?"</p>
<p>In the past few months, Gandhi could have caused India to take disobedient and rebellious actions, and given the British great pain. However, the reason why Gandhi's plan does not go beyond this is not because the difference between riots and acts of disobedience is very small. What he values is that he does not want to take advantage of the British when they are struggling for their life and death and give them undue difficulty. Gandhi would rather wait until the end of the war before making India's demands, rather than using the British's crisis as India's opportunity.</p>
<p>Gandhi is broad-minded and is not bothered by all the disturbances. Under the surging public sentiment, he can remain indifferent and unwavering. He can still respond with jokes and smiles without being troubled by harsh accusations and criticisms from others. Gandhi can skillfully resolve all external difficulties and troubles, which is due to his religious cultivation.</p>
<p>Can Gandhi, with his waning years, witness the liberation of his motherland and achieve his lifelong wish? On this point, he once said: "If India can gain freedom in my lifetime, and I still have the energy, then I will still do my best as a civilian, and together shoulder the important task of national construction under the principle of non-violence." Gandhi's wishes were slightly hinted at in July of last year. At that time, the leaders of the National Congress unanimously resolved that, under the principle of non-violence, if India is not armed to resist foreign aggression, then Gandhi's views may not be completed.</p>
<p>The personal feelings of the leaders of the National Congress and Gandhi can be described as integrated and very close, but the age difference between the two sides is between twenty years, and there are inevitably differences in political views. The National Congress advocated declaring independence from Britain and establishing a wartime national government in Delhi. If Britain could accept this proposal, the Indian National Congress could wholeheartedly support Britain's war. However, the British side has not yet generously accepted.

<h3>Child Pedestrian Safety Education</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council originally scheduled the Road Safety Campaign for mid-June, but it has been postponed to run from the 18th to the 24th of this month, lasting for a week. We know that in road accident cases, the number of people injured or killed is high among children, and this is true not only in China but also in various overseas countries. Therefore, we feel that promoting safety education for child pedestrians is a worthwhile issue to discuss. To ensure that this issue yields practical results, I believe several aspects should be emphasized simultaneously.</p>
<p>Schools: Currently, most schools, especially elementary schools, do not have a set curriculum for implementing safety education, but we cannot overlook the importance of this issue. European and American countries currently place great emphasis on safety education, particularly pedestrian safety education. Although we lack the tools and facilities for safety education, school authorities and teachers should always pay attention and take on the mission of promoting pedestrian safety education to reduce the number of children who die needlessly. Use films or verbal instruction to impart common knowledge about pedestrian safety, such as recognizing traffic lights, police hand signals, and driver hand signals, as well as being aware of places that require special attention when walking.</p>
<p>Parents: As everyone knows, the responsibility of training and educating children falls on teachers at school and on parents at home. Therefore, safety education is extremely important. In particular, road pedestrian safety occupies an even more important position in safety education. Parents should also convey all aspects of road safety and various common-sense facts to their children, telling them how to be safe when walking and what is dangerous. If pedestrian safety education for children is taken care of by both schools and families, the benefits will naturally be multiplied.</p>
<p>Children: It is not enough for just families and schools to pay attention to child pedestrian safety education. The most important point is that children themselves can implement it. They should be able to understand the traffic rules set by the authorities in the city, be especially careful when crossing the road, walk on the left side, understand the meaning of traffic lights, and remember the gestures of drivers. When walking, they should be cautious and not let their attention be diverted to other things. If these two aspects can work together, the safety of children's walking will naturally be greatly improved!</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (22)</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>But learning the lessons in the film "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" was not an easy task. When I was working on that film, I first had to learn how to do that jump rope tap dance. This dance requires jumping rope while tap dancing. I knew that many children and their friends often played jump rope on the sidewalks. However, I didn't know how to jump rope, so I had to go to the gym with Jack Donohue. He taught me how to dance, gave me a rope, and showed me how to jump from beginning to end. Imagine, a big man teaching a little girl how to jump rope, isn't that a lot of fun?</p>
<p>Now I can jump rope, and it's a great game. In the beginning, it was hard work because my legs felt sore after the first lesson. I can jump rope and do tap dance steps at the same time. I carry the rope everywhere and jump everywhere. I jump in the bungalow, in the hallway at home, and even on the set at the studio with my stand-in. Now I treat it as a form of exercise.</p>
<p>People are not very close to me because I go back to my bungalow after each job, and they don't have a chance to approach me. Mr. Sheehan didn't want too many people to approach me, and he didn't want me to appear in various towns because he said that crowds and noise were not suitable for little girls. I didn't care about this, and neither did Mom and Dad, because all three of us like quiet and don't like excitement.</p>
<p>Of the many interesting experiences I've had, one that I find very memorable is playing with mud pies with two black girls, Ann and Nancy, when we were making the film "The Little Colonel." We didn't make these mud pies for the film, but just for ourselves. Also, when I worked with Jane Withers in "Bright Eyes," I had a chance to have fun and be happy. At that time, Jane was about ten or eleven years old, and her attitude towards me seemed not very good during work. When it was time for a break, she realized it herself, immediately ran up to me, put her arms around my neck, and said earnestly, "Shirley, I'm very sorry for treating you like that just now!" I said it didn't matter and didn't need to be taken to heart. So we both went hand in hand to the garden, where there was a doll carriage that Jane pushed in the film. At first, the prop manager refused to let us play with the carriage, but after we begged and pleaded, he finally agreed. Then Jane let me push her around the garden, with Jane putting one hand on the handle, walking with me. Oh, we became good friends!</p>
<h3>Black and White</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>The early winter weather is getting colder day by day. Ah Ming saw that his own clothes changed from a thin white summer shirt to a lined jacket, and then another layer was added. Especially in recent days, the weather has been particularly cold, and his mother put a thick dark black woolen shirt on him. So, his body looked much fatter on the outside. With the addition of these several layers of clothes, he was, of course, much warmer. However, during the moment of changing clothes in the morning and evening, he felt especially cold. Strange! Wearing a single shirt in the summer still felt hot, but now, wearing so many clothes, the cold wind on the way to school still felt piercing. For some reason, Ah Ming asked his brother, "Why are summer clothes mostly white, and winter clothes are mostly black? Can't I wear white clothes in the winter?"</p>
<p>"You ask a good question. You should know that our body temperature is around 37 degrees Celsius. If the air temperature is not much different from the body temperature, the body feels very comfortable; otherwise, it feels either hot or cold. The purpose of wearing clothes is to prevent the already warmed air around the body from escaping in cold weather, and to allow body heat to dissipate in hot weather. Therefore, the climate changes differently in different seasons, and various materials are used to make clothes. In summer, most of the clothes worn are made of linen because linen is the easiest to transmit body heat. Moreover, in summer, we sweat the most, and if the sweat does not evaporate, the whole body feels uncomfortable. Therefore, we wear very thin and white clothes with coarse weaves, which allow air to go straight in and out, unobstructed, so that the hot air around the body does not stagnate. White cloth is used to prevent the sun's heat from being completely absorbed, and most of it is reflected, which is a unique property of white, and it also looks much cooler in the eyes. In winter, the outside temperature is very low, and our body temperature easily dissipates, which makes us feel cold. So, we have to wear several layers of clothes to feel warm. This not only increases the thickness of the clothes but also increases the air contained within them because air does not conduct heat. If the outermost layer of clothing is made so that it does not let air through at all, it will be very warm. Silk and cotton clothes are the warmest because they are very loose and contain the most air. For fur clothes, we should wear the fur side inside to be very warm, but many fashionable women expose the fur on the outside, which is not warm at all except for looking good, which makes no sense. Dark black colors have the property of absorbing all the sun's heat, so black clothes feel very warm. In winter, it is not impossible to wear white, but it will be cold on your own body and has nothing to do with others!"</p>
<h3>Elementary School Student Summer Homework Competition – Third Place, Advanced Level – A Meaningful Thing During Summer Vacation</h3>
<p>— Denian Elementary School, Tang Yu You</p>
<p>Since the start of the "August 13th" battle, prices have risen day by day, and life has become more and more difficult. Many compatriots, under the high pressure of the whip of life, work hard for survival and cannot get enough to eat all day long. Most of them have no time to take care of their children's education problems, so after the war, many children who have no school to attend and can only wander around have been added to the alleys of Shanghai. They wander around all day and are not educated, so they naturally fall into the lower class.</p>
<p>Our school is also in an alley, and it is no exception. There is also a group of wild children who often bully the general elementary school students at the front and back doors of our school. They snatch the toys of elementary school students; throw the hats of elementary school students; beat and scold elementary school students; and squeeze and bump into female students. They can do all kinds of evil deeds.</p>
<p>When classes are in session at school, they write words that insult the principals or classmates of the school on the walls outside the door with white chalk, or knock on the door a few times outside the door as if someone is knocking on the door. When you open the door and look, there is not even a shadow of anyone. It is really annoying.</p>
<p>The teachers' investigation revealed that the leader of this group of wild children is named Shi Gen. He has also studied for five years, but now he has no money, so he has dropped out of school.</p>
<p>During the summer vacation, the school made a ping-pong table for us to play games. When Shi Gen saw it, he was very interested! He asked the teacher to allow him to join in the game and guaranteed that he would never cause trouble again. The teacher wanted to turn him into a good child, so he agreed to his request. On the one hand, he could have a proper game to play and no longer cause trouble, and on the other hand, he could gradually influence him at any time to make him change his ways and become a good person. For more than a month, he has indeed changed from bad to good and is very polite. He does not make any noise in the school, and he is no longer lawless to other children in the alley.</p>
<h3>Newspaper Reading Handbook</h3>
<p>— Mu Sheng</p>
<p>Little friends! You can always see the "Children's Weekly" specially set up for you in this newspaper every Sunday morning, right! Although it only publishes five or six articles in each issue, it contains a lot of knowledge! Look! It has articles that belong to common sense, articles that belong to conversation, articles that belong to science, and articles that belong to...Little friends! It is indeed your "Knowledge Compendium".</p>
<p>But, little friends! After you read this "Knowledge Compendium" every time, you will probably forget what is said in each article and your own insights after a few weeks or months, isn't that a pity? Never mind! There is a way, which is to make a "Newspaper Reading Handbook" for each person.</p>
<p>The materials and methods for the "Newspaper Reading Handbook" are very simple. I will now briefly write it down below:</p>
<p>Materials: Just prepare a useless notebook (such as a telephone book, etc.), some paste, and a pair of scissors.</p>
<p>Method: Cut out the articles published in each issue carefully with scissors, and then paste them on the notebook in different categories with paste. If you have any feelings or insights of your own, you may also record them and transcribe them after the article.</p>
<p>This is how a "Newspaper Reading Handbook" is made.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>Playing games with two people is more interesting than playing games alone; reading is also the same, it is easier to make progress when two people study each other than when one person studies alone.</p>
<p>Children of the modern age must have modern common sense, the era of relying only on what is read in some textbooks is over.</p>
<p>"Learning" should be done by both "learning" and "asking". "Learning without asking" is rote learning, and "asking without learning" is empty learning. Little friends, remember! Remember!</p>

<h3>Film Industry Brewing a Lawsuit</h3>
<p>— Yin Yi</p>
<p>Guohua to Sue Yuan Meiyun for Breach of Contract; Yuan Retains Chen Tingrui as Lawyer for Defense</p>
<p>A lawsuit is about to erupt in the film industry recently and is currently in the works. It would be an unfortunate event if it cannot be resolved.</p>
<p>The instigator of the lawsuit is Liu Zhonghao, owner of Guohua Film Company, and the target of the lawsuit is Yuan Meiyun.</p>
<p>The internal situation of this incident is as follows:</p>
<p>Around December of last year, Guohua planned to produce "Glamorous Romance" (華麗緣), with the main character belonging to Yuan Meiyun. Yuan Meiyun was a basic actor for China United Film Company (中國聯合影業公司). Guohua attempted to invite her as a guest star. Initially, Zhou Xuan (周璇) and Yuan Yanyun (袁延雲) were sent to persuade her. Zhou Xuan was Liu Zhonghao's adopted daughter, and she and Yuan Meiyun were colleagues at Yihua Film Company (藝華公司) in the past and had always had a good relationship. Before Yuan Meiyun, Zhou Xuan did not make any blatant gestures, but encouraged Yuan Meiyun to guest star in one or two films for Guohua. The meaning was that if Yuan Meiyun agreed, she could act as an intermediary. However, Yuan Meiyun rejected her kindness at that time. Later, Liu Zhonghao personally visited Yuan Meiyun and made a request to guest star in a film. Yuan Meiyun declined politely based on two reasons: first, she had a contract with China United, and second, her husband, Wang Yin (王引), was in Hong Kong, and she could not make a decision on her own. Later, Liu Zhonghao visited Yuan Meiyun three times in quick succession. The last time, he brought 2,000 yuan in cash. His wording was very euphemistic, saying that if China United's General Manager Zhang Shankun (張善琨) did not allow her to guest star in a film for Guohua, or if Wang Yin came back and objected, it would not hurt to call it off and return the money. He solemnly stated that as long as Yuan Meiyun accepted the money, filming could be done at any time and did not have to be done immediately. At that time, Yuan Meiyun, unable to refuse the hospitality, made two points to Liu Zhonghao: (1) If the China United leadership did not approve, the money would be returned, and the original agreement would be cancelled. (2) The remuneration for each film would be at least 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>As a result of the consultation, Liu Zhonghao said that the first point was absolutely no problem since he had proposed it. He asked to reduce the remuneration to 3,000 yuan. Yuan Meiyun believed that this matter might not be approved by China United, and since Liu Zhonghao had made an oral guarantee that it would be called off if it was not approved, she agreed. At the moment, she signed a receipt stating that three films would be filmed, with a remuneration of 9,000 yuan, and 1,000 yuan would be paid in advance as a deposit.</p>
<p>After Yuan Meiyun signed the receipt and received the deposit, Liu Zhonghao stated to Yuan Meiyun that one of the three films was "Glamorous Romance" (華麗緣), which was planned to be divided into two parts. Yuan Meiyun immediately stated that this was not possible because it would be equivalent to filming four films. Liu Zhonghao agreed to discuss it later.</p>
<p>Afterwards, Wang Yin in Hong Kong learned of this matter and strongly disagreed. He wrote a quick letter to Yuan Meiyun, preventing her from accepting Guohua's invitation. Yuan Meiyun deposited the 2,000 yuan deposit into the Jiading Commercial Savings Bank (嘉定商業儲蓄銀行). On the one hand, she reported the matter to Zhang Shankun and asked him to mediate. After Wang Yin returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong, he asked Fan Liangbo (樊良伯), the general manager of Jiading Bank (who had not yet passed away at the time), to mediate, willing to return the deposit in accordance with Liu Zhonghao's original promise and call it off. However, Guohua did not agree and urged Yuan Meiyun to carry out the previous agreement.</p>
<p>The matter was almost at a stalemate. Guohua insisted that Yuan Meiyun fulfill the agreement based on that receipt, while Yuan Meiyun resolutely refused. This matter has been delayed until recently, when Guohua brought up the old matter again and issued a filming notice to Yuan Meiyun, which Yuan Meiyun naturally did not accept. Therefore, it is rumored that Guohua will file a lawsuit against Yuan Yanyun for breach of contract and demand compensation for losses.</p>
<p>Now, Yuan Meiyun is also planning countermeasures. She has retained lawyer Chen Tingrui (陳霆銳) as her legal advisor and will ask Chen to appear in court to defend her if a lawsuit is filed.</p>
<p>It is expected that the development of this matter will attract great attention in the film industry.</p>
<h3>Wang Huaying's Magic</h3>
<p>Qingxin Middle School (淸心中學) held its 80th-anniversary celebration at the Ningbo Native Place Association (寧波同鄕會) starting on the 13th, and various performances such as plays, music, comedy, and martial arts were held for three consecutive days until yesterday, and the situation was very enthusiastic. Among them was Wang Huaying's (王化影) magic, which was rare, such as women appearing in empty boxes and small flags turning into large flags, all of which were very interesting. Especially the last section of horizontally laying a woman in the air was even more amazing; first, a woman standing up was hypnotized by Wang Huaying, and the woman stood upright. Then, two assistants lay her horizontally in the air. There were no hanging ropes above, and there were no supports below. Then, an iron ring was used to cover her from head to toe to indicate that there were no hanging objects in the air and no shelves on the ground. It is said that this kind of magic comes from India, and it is rare to see it in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Cases</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Zhao Boxiong's Confession</p>
<p>Hawthorne looked up at him and asked, "When you fired the gun, you clearly believed that she was still alive, right?"</p>
<p>Zhao Boxiong looked a little uneasy. The tip of his tongue was exposed outside his lips again. He said uncomfortably, "Yes, this was my recklessness, but it was actually because I was overly excited. But I immediately felt this mistake when I got back in the car. Because not only did she not shout after being shot, I seemed to remember that there was no movement at all. I suspected that she may have already been murdered before I shot her, and I only shot a dead person!"</p>
<p>A smile suddenly appeared on the corner of Hawthorne's lips, but the smile disappeared in an instant. He said coldly, "Your mistake was discovered very quickly, and you also have a very high estimate of your own shooting skills."</p>
<p>Zhao Boxiong's eyes widened again. "Mr. Hawthorne, please allow me to say something presumptuous. My handgun shooting, within ten yards, can achieve a score of 99 percent."</p>
<p>When he said this, his expression and tone both had a smug expression. I secretly thought that he was exaggerating, fortunately, he still left one point. The bullet on the wooden wall of the telephone room of the Yadon Hotel was probably the one point that was missing his perfection.</p>
<p>He added, "Actually, even if my handgun hadn't hit, she should have shouted and stood up if she was a living person. It was very natural for me to realize my mistake."</p>
<p>"After I returned to the hotel, my only plan was that if this matter was revealed, I could not be involved in it for the sake of my mission. Therefore, I temporarily changed a room. This morning, I disguised myself and went around the seventh floor again to see if anyone suspected me. I happened to see two gentlemen investigating Agen at Room 71. I was a little scared because I knew that this matter had gone through Mr. Hawthorne's hands, and he had already noticed me. The danger of my being involved was simply unavoidable." He suddenly frowned, clasped his hands together, expressing a deep sense of regret. He continued: "Mr. Hawthorne, when I think back now, I was really too stupid at that time. I didn't think of explaining the whole story to you frankly, but I was confused for a while and adopted that clumsy way of warning. Mr. Hawthorne, I am very sorry for this." (168)</p>
