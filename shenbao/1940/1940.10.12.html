<p>華盛頓　今日此間消息、美國鄭重注視英蘇關係之進展、顯已採取平行策略、以促蘇聯在可能之基礎上予美有限制的外交合作、外交界消息、國務院與蘇駐美大使奧曼斯基之談話、或曾討論尙存極大矛盾之英蘇關係、至英首相關於重啓緬甸公路之宣吿、或即取悅蘇聯、暨使中美二國滿意之一種表示、彼等復又指稱、蘇聯致力援助中國、今次新生外交陣錢、英國旣已放棄往昔觀念轉臉面對日本、則先前橫亘英蘇關係之主要阻碍當可予以免移去、彼等繼稱、蘇聯商業代表團現在仍未離去倫敦、此種商業談判、可以視為具體合作之初朕兆、而蘇聯此刻所予世界一種深刻印象者、即渠對於軸心民主雙方目下尙未有所決定、設今關於日本依附軸心之結果而予蘇以足够之誘導，則蘇當可傾向民主方面也、蓋蘇聯報紙確亦擁護此種見解、在過數日之中業已表示對英友好、</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>時局與上海居民</h3>
<p>近因國際局勢之變化，上海市塲又形動盪；大多數之心理，非心懷畏怖，即意存僥倖。畏怖者即以為一旦戰事延及南洋，波及太牛洋，則工商業最受影響者，香港之外，莫如上海：上海原有之孤島地位。恐將動搖。而在此狀况卜之上海工商業之處境、或亦將合作其名，獨占其實，苛捐雜稅，不勝騷擾。夫人孰無患得患失之情，何况為其財產所關，事業所在，瞻念前途，能保具不動心乎？即使不至於斯極，然上海原其有國際性質，平時以英美占其大部分勢力，而能遵守的章，市民猶得安居樂業；一旦强權繼代，予取予求，喜怒好惡，恣所欲為；此其間，影響百業者，相差遠甚。故無不惴惴以思，慄慄以懼；若大禍之將臨；其實豈必然哉。若以所憂所慮，為未來事勢所必至，則憂亦何益，如所慮所憂，在將來未必盡然、則今日之所憂慮，又徒見其為多憂多慮而已。應知上海租界乃一國際商塲也。英美德義乃中多數其他國家皆有其財產權利；即法租界名為一國人士所管理，而實際上，各國所有之利害關係，恐亦不亞於公共租界，惟無公共租界之旗幟鮮明耳。故各國放棄其全部對華貿易則已，如不放棄，則無論何國必欲保持上海原有之國際性質，及其中立地位，不願使之偏於一方，類於獨占；不然既擅目破壞與巾國政府之的定。且亦喪失其自由公平貿易之機會，此則以對華貿易為重之各國，決不願自貽伊戚也。故以變更上海租界現狀為慮，而生畏怖心者，似亦失之過早。何况磨拳擦掌，非皆抉心出於決鬥，乘瑕抵隙，是否終於一戰，其機會與可能，至多參牛而已。</p>
<p>至以時局變化而生僥倖心者，在商言商，商人所重者利，人人所欲者財，夫日僥倖，則必就其資產，乘此時會，以圖一逞，有如買空賣空以投機也，趁火打刧以發所謂「國難財」是也。但前有國難財可發者，以幣値由高而低；物價由低而高，就幣之數量以為比較，顯見有所增益也。今則各物已貴，容或再漲，但漲之程度固多，而跌之機會可謂更多；有跌有漲，於中一博，則博之道亦艱矣。而猶是抱舊日之信念，以為保產之道，發財之術，無過於囤貨也者，是則名日投機，不念今日之機」，與昔日之機「有逈異乎，抑相同乎？必確信其或異或同之點，而後可投不可投之理斯得。抑知今之為囤積，非同昔比。昔可以各出少數資本，互相集合換奇計贏，今則不然。以米言，百餘元一包之米價，囤百包即需萬金，千包需十萬金，已非小資本湊集所能從事矣。若以滬上棧存六十萬包　算其囤本，蓋達五六千萬元之鉅。試問五六千萬元之資力，若果盡出於小囤戶之集資，而無大資力者操縱其間，其誰信之。信之而為之說非為大囤戶移轉其目光，即為囤戶施烟慕，而蠱惑大衆。察其用心。抬價歛財，其一也；謀叨囤積之危險，轉嫁於外行之追踵囤積者，其二也。米若此，此外如布若紗若麵粉若一切雜糧油餅，固無一不如此。吾人一面猶如歷來之主張，希望由租界當局切實懲儆；一面則鑒於時局動盪，謠詠朋興，大多數之略有資財者，旣惶惶然若不知所歸，復歆羨於喪心病狂者之相繼發財而見獵心喜，盲目盲心，欲步武發財之後塵而不知適以自投陷阱，是大可憫也。爰不辭更為揭穿；要知適應於此動盪之時局之中，要在自重自愛；莫患財少，最患不能守，允患貪財。未嘗投機囤貨者，莫以為時局利投機，宜囤貨，自召傾家蕩產之禍；即在已事投機囤貨者，亦應為時局前途而「戒嚴」，不問盈虧，立即脫手了結，則換得幾分法幣，便是保障幾分生活。庶幾靜觀時變，謠諑何足動心哉！</p>
<h3>中央國府　聯合紀念國慶　林主席旣度演講　勗國民更加奮發</h3>
<p>重慶　中央黨部、國民政府、今日舉行國慶紀念聯合紀念會、林主席演講、略謂、今天是中華民國二十九年的國慶紀念日、從民國二十六年七月七日戰事發生之後、到現在止、舉行這雙十節國慶紀念會、已經是第四次、我們在困難嚴重的時期當中、舉行這個最神聖最光榮的開國慶典、有無限的感慨、和無限的興奮、我們一方面回想國父和辛亥革命先烈對於國家民族的慘淡經營、眞是創業維艱、需要我們來保全、更需要我們來發揚光大、一方面又展望黨國的前途和國際的形勢、覺得我們所負的責任、實在是異常重大、我們必須要史加奮發、繼續辛亥年的革命精神、完成復興民族的大業、才對得起國父和民衆、國父在民國八年國慶紀念日的演說、中間曾經這樣說過、「革命之事業、尙未成功也、革命之目的尙未達到也、尚有待於後起者之繼成大業也、民國由革命　來、則凡今日承涊民國者、必當服膺於革命主義、罪勉力行、以達革命之目的、而建設為民所有、為民所治、為民所享之國家、以貽留我中華民族子孫萬年之事業、庶幾今日乃有慶祝之價値、」國父又在民族主義演講詞中說過、「我們不但要恢復民族的地位、還要對於世界負一個人責任、這便是民族主義的眞精神、」國父這些寶貴遺敎、對於國慶紀念的　義和革命建國的方針都指示得非常明白都是我們在這紀念國慶的今天、要深切了解和切實遵行的、</p>
<p>而找們當前的重任、不但要爭取領土中權的完整、並且還要發揮找們民族潛在的偉大力量、在東亞做一個安定的重心、對世界的公理正誼與眞正永久的和平、盡我們應盡的維護責任、我們迥溯旣往、廿九年前的辛亥革命、雖然推翻了滿淸、建立了民國、但是因為有了國內和國外的種種阻力、不但從武員起義到民國八年、國父在國慶紀念日演說的時候、還沒有完成革命的事業、　到革命的目的、需耍國父來昭示我們、我們就是一直到廿九年後的今大、也還是沒有成就我們的革命大業、達到我們的革命目的、還是在等待我們這般後起者來完成這革命建國的重大任務、撫今追昔、眞有無窮的慚愧、我們因為看淸了革命沒有成功的原因、是由于國內與國外的兩種阻力沒有鏟除之故、整個革命事業、在辛亥革命以後、沒有機會來實行國父的革命方略、着手非常建設、也就沒有方法達到我們的革命埋想、所以大家必須一心一德、這兩</p>
<p>，完成眞正的統一事業、一切政治經濟建設、國防建設、也都在突飛猛進、一日千里、可見國內的阻力、巳經不成問題了、現在還在妨碍我們革命進行的惟有種外來的阻力、這種阻力不克服、革命事業就一天不能成功、我們國家民族的生存獨立和世界人類的正義和平、也就得不到保障、現在對日作戰巳經有了三年零三個月、在這三年多的艱險時期中、我們雖然遭受了很大的犧牲、但是我們早巳有了堅決的信心、愈戰愈强、愈持久愈有把握不到最後勝利，決不中途罷休、我相信凡是黃帝子孫、永遠沒有被征服的一天、我全國同胞艱苦奪鬥的光榮事跡、眞値得我們欽佩、允其是我們軍事統帥勤勞籌劃、全國戰士英勇奮鬥、海外僑胞熱心捐款、及</p>
<p>倫陷區域同胞的犧牲精神，都為全世界友邦所贊　、我們更在這紀念國慶的時候想着他們這樣勞苦功高、對於國家民族的偉大貢獻、除了表示我們的欽佩以外、必須對於他們表示誠懇的慰勞、同時又想到全國各戰塲殉職的將士與夫</p>
<p>我死難的同志同胞、必須對於他們表示崇高的敬禮、撫恤他們的遺族、敎養仙們的子孫、我們對於參加抗戰的將士叫胞全國、在精神上唯一的安慰、就是吿訴他們奮鬥犧牲的代價、不只是保衛祖國的獨立生存、同時還得到維持世界公理正義、擁護民主政體、爭取永久和平的偉大成果、光明漸漸接近、勝利必定屬於我們、從前我們軍政當局大聲疾呼說、中國的作戰、差不多替世界民主國家做了先鋒、但當時、這種預察先機的警吿、只有世界少數具有遠大眼光的政治家、才有同樣的觀感、卽一般近視的人們、或者免不了錯認為我們自己的宜傳作用、現在事實擺在面前、若是沒有中國的三年抵抗、恐怕所謂「大東亞新秩序」、早已在歐戰初期緊張的時候、就實現了、所以中國軍備雖不如人、對於世界上民主國家却已盡了前衛的責任、影響之大、可以想像而知、這種偉大實獻、可以引起全世界人士之同情心與自覺心、大勢所趨、各國自會聯台一致、向公理正義的光明大道携手進行、所以我們奮鬥的意義決不僅僅為一個國家一個民挨的獨立生存、至於我們對自已的督責、仍舊要繼承國父和先烈以及抗戰殉難同志同胞的革命情緒、不怕艱難、不惜犧牲、立定決心、奮鬥到底、無論當前的環境怎樣困難、國際的局勢怎樣變化、認定我們復興大業、必須依靠自已、不能仰仗外力、一致奮起、奉行國父在民國八年國慶紀念日吿訴我們要繼承大業的遺敎、近則達成抗戰建國的目的、遠則奠定東亞和世界眞正永久和平的基礎、實現三民主義、促進世界大同、才算盡了我們後起者資任、也才能不辜負我們今天這個莊嚴的慶典、（十日電）</p>

<h3>奮斗三年後的中國國慶節　中國人民應有之認識</h3>
<p>二十九年前的今天，由中國國父孫中山先生的偉大領導，與無數先烈的慷慨就義，為國犧牲，中國始得推翻帝制，建立共和。在東亞及世界風雲展開重大變化的今年雙十節，中國人民追憶到當年建國的業蹟，必須深切認識中國革命建國的目標，繼續革命先烈的精神，克盡自身當前的偉大任務。中國革命建國的目標，是要實現孫中山先生的三民主義，一方面求得中國的獨立自由，一方面要發揮中國民族固有道德的偉大精神，來恢複中國民族的地位，促進全人類的和平幸福。中國立國在東亞，當然先要謀東亞的安寗，也惟有確保太平洋的安定，而後全世界和平纔有確實的保障。所以孫中山先生畢生奮鬥的偉大目標，也就是辛亥革命建國的偉大理想，不外乎內而充實國防，求得中國的自由平等；外而安定亞洲，獲致世界之眞正和平</p>
<p>然而日方却惟恐中國革命建國這一個目標的完成，因為他們所抱的一貫企圖，是控制東亞，征服世界，倘中國建國完成而臻於强盛，他們的企圖卽無法實現。因此田中奏摺中不但說「如欲征服世界，必先征服中國」：又說一最可恐怕者，卽中國日就醒覺，將來中國統一，工業必隨之發達，故必須積極對滿蒙强取權利，再以滿蒙為司令塔，攫取全中國之利源」。這不是田中一人之言，而為日方的基本國策，自辛亥革命以來，日本對於中國統一與經濟復興及國防建設，不斷加以干涉與破壞，國民革命軍北伐以後，阻撓中國建國的企圖，更為顯著。由九一八以至七七，更對中國作大規模的進攻，中國在忍無可忍之下，奮起圖存，三年餘的奮鬥，實為力求實現建國理想而戰，亦卽為完成辛亥革命事業，實現三民主義而戰，必須達到恢復主權獨立，領土行政完整的　的，也必須達到樹立國際信義，人類公理，與世界和平的目的，方可謂完成革命命「世上惟公理不可磨滅正義必能戰勝强權」。中國人民在建國紀念的雙十節，對此更須有澈底的認識。</p>
<p>日本的企圖，是他們自巳所毫不隱諱的。田中奏摺中公然無忌的說：「日本要以中國富源，作為征服印度洋中小亞細亞及歐羅巴之用」；又說「日本必須與美國蘇聯一戰」。他們所謂「東亞新秩序」，就是要太平洋所有國家，都屈服於日本的威力之下，承認它為亞洲唯一的主宰。中國明白這一點，所以不僅決心作戰，來粉碎它征服中國的企圖；且要以此來打破它征服東亞的夢想。中國為東亞最古最大之國，無中國卽無東亞，而東亞安危，關係中國生存至深且切，故中國決不辭以安定東亞之先鋒自任。</p>
<p>自從歐戰以來日本見有機可乘，卽將「東亞新秩序」進而為「大東亞新秩序」，妄想乘人之危積極南進。最近更訂立三國同盟，這種倒行逆施的政策，實在是它內心惶急的表現。中國為了自衛與建國，必盡力之所及以謀應付。中國決不容忍所謂「東亞新秩序」或「大東亞新秩序」凡承認日本「大東亞領導地位」之國家，必有後悔之一日。因為任何與日本成立關於東亞之條的，凡為中國人民所反對者，必等於一張廢紙，不能發生任何效力。日本的本意，實在是要利用這三國同盟，以求結束「中國事變」，中國只要堅持到底決不屈服，則這種企圖必成粉碎。</p>
<p>回溯辛亥革命當時，中國建國諸先烈所處的環境，其艱難不下於今日而他們所憑藉的則尙不及今日中國前綫諸將士於萬一，然而他們萬死不辭，不折不回，終以赤手空拳，締造民國。正如中山先生所說：「黃花崗之役，以三百人打三萬多人，以手槍炸彈抵禦長槍大砲；至於武漢起義，則是用一個人打五百個人。這種奮鬥，是古今中外兵法上所沒有的，只有革命歷史中才有此創例」。中國民族如欲永遠生存於世界，就得效法先烈此種精神，要像他們一樣拾身報國犧牲一切，這樣才可達到革命建國成功的目的。而美國的獨立，蘇俄的革命，以及土耳其的復興中諸志士仁人歷萬險，破萬難，忍飢耐寒，堅强苦幹的精神，也同樣可供中國人民的效法。</p>
<p>中國現時的奮鬥，誠然是進入艱鉅的階級，但較之辛亥當時的環境要優越得多。因為中國作戰的對象，只是一個，而世界上所有愛好正義的國家，都是中國的友人，誰都希望亞洲有一個獨立强盛的中國。誰都預期着勝利後新中國的發展。可以有助於世界經濟五助合作，有助於世界眞正和平的樹立。所以祇要中國人民自身確具自信自此加倍努力，則任何外來的阻力，均不足為革命建國目標完成的障碍。</p>
<p>中國此次作戰目始至終以自立自强的立塲，獨力奮鬥，以貫澈其堅定不移的目標，因此國際形勢無論如何變化，都於中國有利，而絲毫不受其影響。最近各友邦對華援助更見積極，對日制裁也更見加緊。這果然有利於中國的作戰，但最大的無形的意義就是國際局勢的演變，一天天與中國所抱的目的更接近。孫中山先生救世的理想，必能在此次世界大動亂中，為世人所認識，而最後必全部實現。中國人民祇要抱定信心，任何環境困難，均可打破。國際形勢有利的時候固然要努力，卽或國際形勢有所不利的時候，也是還要奮鬥到底。未來的歷史，已經注定中國建國是一定成功的。</p>
<p>蔣委員長會經在民國二十六年的雙十節說過，「這一戰非一年半載可了。」在奮鬥三年後的現在，中國的艱苦奮鬥，已經接上了全世界在獲得最後光明前的總淸算。中國人民更應該感覺到他們眞是任重致遠，所以必須有更大的勇氣與忍耐，更進一步的刻苦與勤勞，以從事神聖的建國工作。中國人民必須知道中山先生從前苦心垂敎的一切建國典則就是預期到有今天這樣一個千載難逢的機會；他們必須以下列三點作為勗勉自身體立行的準備：（一）集中意志，充實民國，奠定健全的政治基礎。（二）開發產業增加生產，努力研究創造，以奠定堅實而獨立的經濟基礎。（三）努力訓練，振興工業，改良武器，開展交通，以奠立中山先生所定國防計盡的基礎。</p>
<p>中國全國軍民，尤其具有知識技能的領導人士，認淸中國復興的責仟與東亞興亡世界盛衰的責任，都在他們的肩上，這責任是不能規避的。必須站定脚跟以至忠至勇的決心，成就至偉至大的事業，纔不愧為中山先生與革命先烈的後繼者，繼算礎到對民族祖先與對東亞對世界的莊嚴使命。</p>

<h3>金融　外匯回緊</h3>
<p>昨日外匯市况、滙豐掛牌仍半、英美滙晤市、潛勢轉緊、乃反映日美關係、略鬆所致、而外行吃胃進步、晨初一度軟至三辦士七五及五元七八一二五、但華行與投機商頗有賣胃、且日銀行亦來塞出、故不久緊風遂息、轉入盤旋、結果以三辦士八一二五及五元八七五收盤、較假前軋緊〇一五六二五及一二五、</p>
<p>華商仍有賣出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠各跌〇六二五、紐約銀價仍　、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對　勿動、對滬升一八七五、美對英跌七五、對滬大二角七分、（以上均照假前軋過、）中央掛肆各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價英金三辦士七八一二五，美滙五元八七五、較之假前、英學〇四六八七五、美軟一二五、開後有利麥加利吃胃頗濃、而某美行亦有納胃、雖華商乘機賣出、但市面終吿續軟、計做開本月　美匯五元八七五與八一二五、期時現貨緊至三辦士七五及五元七八一二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉跌半分、此後華商繼續吐出、加之日銀行亦忽興賣意、而外行吃胃漸淡、市勢頓吿回硬、計做開本月份美滙五元八七五及九〇六二五、同時華行大陸亦吐予外行有利十月份美匯五元九〇六二五、十時半後華行吃進華商本月份美匯五元九三七五、斯時現貨亦鬆至三辦士八二八一二五及五元九三七五可結、午刻賣者减少、潛勢轉平、迄至午收、英金三辦士八一二五、美匯五元九〇六二五、</p>
<p>午後人氣轉變</p>
<p>後市港電首來拋出、潛勢初時微硬、計吐予外行本月份美滙五元九三七五、同時投機商此價亦有賣出、但不久經營者心思忽轉、反來扒入外行本月份美匯五元九〇六二五、市象遂行軟化、入後本月期五元九〇六二五、頗難結得、迄晚收英金仍三辦士八一二五、美匯為五元八七五、十一月期英金三辦士七九六八七五、美匯五元八四三七五、結果比假前現期英緊〇一五六二五、美軟一二五、</p>
<p>香港美金不定</p>
<p>香港十一日（週五）電、今晨匯市開盤央平、美呈動還、英美日各匯概無榮辱、申滙現貨升一元、為三百八十八元、允時五十分、美匯現貨硬〇六二五為廿三元二五、十一時三十分平穩、美匯現貨回軟〇六二五、仍為廿三元一八七五、下午二時三十分開盤，仍吿平穩、各匯仍無榮辱、</p>
<p>天津英平美緊</p>
<p>天津十一日（週五）電、今晨匯市開盤動盪不定、英匯現貨不動、仍站三便士五六二五、美滙現貨軟六二五、為五元五六二五、申匯升五角、為一百〇五元七角半、「聯鈔」暗盤昂一元二角半、為七十八元七角半、</p>
<h3>補空雖起　金市所漲尙微</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤轉入佳境、良以遠東日美關係、已稍鬆弛、致一部份操業者、心思轉變、逢賤補空、在搜不巳、但因錢兌業與銀號仍一貫作風、續來拋空、故當日回風並不過份猛烈、結果以五千五百七十元收盤、較假前軋漲六十五元、收後塲外堅挺、做達五千五百八十五元、全天交易約三千數百兩、銀樓飾金掛高十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤漲六十五元</p>
<p>晨初因遠東局勢稍鬆、匯市吿緊、開市遂比假前抬升三十五元、銀號出金號三十兩、為五千五百四十元、繼因錢兌業及證券幫稍塞、回挫十元、證券幫銀號各出銀樓業十兩、退為五千五百三十元、嗣匯市報緊、加之某金號力扒不息、而銀號斯時亦買、不久卽升至　千五百九十五元、旋因外匯回鬆、錢兌業乘高拋空頗力、而買戶審愼旁觀屆多、加之銀號幫反來賣出、未幾卽跌達五千五百零五元低盤、後匯市復稍走緊、某金號買意重萌、且證券幫亦跟之搜入、又漲至五千五百八十元、惟收盤前買者减少、錢兌業及浮多吐出、收市遂吿五千五百四十八元，午後開市、銀樓業進錢兌業二十兩、為五千五百六十元、俄傾金號多頭忽來稍吐、立跌至五千五百三十五元、旋證券幫及銀號競扒、復升至五千五百七十元、後以某銀號傾向拋空、錢兌業亦賣、又退至五千五百五十元、入後卒因證券幫及另一銀號車來爭購、收盤前遂抬至五千五百七十五元、晚收則為五千五百七十元、結果比假前軋漲六十五元、收後潛勢堅穩、塲外做過五千五百八十五元、全犬九十元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價、照烚赤較高十餘元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛大十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、九時半掛大十元、此後則無變勸、大同行改懸五百七十元、新同行與上價相仿、收　减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>外幣都漲　日票獨落</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、以國際局勢並無新發展、人心比較安定、烚赤回漲、外滙轉縮、英美金鎊纔漲二元、英金票則因供逾於求、市價續跌一元、美金票於晨初會高至十六元九角、但未幾叉退至十六元四角二分、卒為十六元七角、比假前計漲五角、香港票稍有需要、市價略漲、新加坡票及羅比菲列濱票等俱漲一角、日金票則因美日關係較緊、各方供給頓旺、市價暴落、晚市退為一元三角四分、朝鮮票趨勢尙平、晚市仍站一元一角三分原價、</p>
<h3>證券　內債依然興奮</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日　當開市、初以二十四號卽中國信託公司賣出甚湧、而為數甚鉅、繼以十六號又來乘低吸收、而回漲亦勁逢小買進、頗不乏人、此决行市連小五日、放空者巳經不少、故跌易漲亦不難、環境幷無變化、昨日上午初開、在十六號二十五號買進中、會緩緩抬高、繼以二十四及四卡一號賣出、　吿不支、丙種又打破七兀、雖有聯益同康等買進、無如久豐姓昶等仍有賣出、故市價未能抬頭、午後新消息又屬利多、十六及同康繼續買進、鼎康鴻大信孚紛紛買進、雖有聯益聯和恒康及怡泰賣出、但檯面仍屬求過於供、丙種穿出七元、戊樓亦衝出七元、乙種冉見六十元外、形勢極佳、故結果各種除乙種尙漲起二角外、餘祇小一角半至四角半不等、成交總數、共的一百五十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交三友實業社股一百股、價為二十一元、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市，假期中並無寺殊肖息傳來、晚市開盤殊形活潑、在新買戶活動與空頭急補下、市况上漲頗勁、各股中之有空頭地位者、幾已完全恢復週三所落之價、荷印各橡皮公司股成交不鮮、</p>
<h3>投機詩話</h3>
<p>— 胡毅孟</p>
<p>此次因傳撤退遠東美僑，及重開緬甸公路，如是外股市塲，乃因人心紛亂，一瀉千里，傾家蕩產者，大有人在，足以作迷戀外股及嗜好投機者之當頭棒喝。不過鄙人亦恭居其一，十年心血，一旦精光，在百無聊賴之時，祇得拂紙吮豪，借吟懷以寄恨，藉以贈我同好，而警惕來茲。</p>
<p>外股吟（調寄浪淘沙）</p>
<p>外股博金銀，一紙為憑，跌風倐起實堪驚。深鎖鐵箱開不得，觸目傷心。東亞戰雲興，草木皆兵，天堂將變集中營，祇悔當初輕法幣，自討呻吟。</p>
<p>挪威一役，外股狂瀉，不可收拾，上週甫轉佳境，不謂又以當前局勢，在瀾重倒慨然賦此！（七絕）</p>
<p>弱榦經霜甫茁芽，</p>
<p>技頭初復舊繁華，</p>
<p>太平洋上笳聲起，</p>
<p>一夜西風又落花。</p>
<p>十月九日市塲一瞥（七絕）</p>
<p>上次空頭補不成，</p>
<p>今朝拋出購無人，</p>
<p>勸君一洗屠龍手，</p>
<p>靜看江東日暮雲。</p>
<p>（却酬）</p>
<p>倫敦十日（週四）電、　（九日）今兩日（十日）中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票　牌行市、仍為銀行股　有上落、九日麥加利銀行股上升二先令六便士、價為七鎊、匯曹銀行英倫註冊股仍站六十四鎊、香港註冊股仍聞七十四鎊、有行無市、十日麥加利銀行股回降二先令六便士、仍為六鎊十七先令六便士、匯豐銀行英倫註冊股跌六鎊半、價為五十七鎊半、又香港註冊股跌四鎊、價為七十鎊、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>英法地產派息</h3>
<p>英商英法地產有限公可、定於十月二十二日分派截至一九四一年二月底止一年度之中期股息、每股國幣二元、</p>
<h3>紗花　多空見解不同　紗市迴旋</h3>
<p>紗市仍在迴旋之境、目前市塲議論紛岐、買方說原棉堅昂血看漲、賣方云外滙放長、存紗雄厚、加之時局緊張、且比低降時巳漲起四百元、或者可回小一步、所以買賣兩方爭持、殊為劇烈也、今日有棉紗一千一百七十五件運香港、五十五件運烟台、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人心尙好、塲內買戶興緻尙濃蜜、二十支雙馬價為一千一百七十元、旋聞日紗平庸、而外　縮而又復回升、故叫喊雖聲勢汹汹、然高價時新買者較為缺之、市盤又見向下、跌至一千一百六十二元、但有一部份搶帽子起來扒空、稍形回好、迨至收盤、仍屬平平、查半日間成交統計四千二百七十包、行情一十支雙馬跌十元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>棉市靜寂</h3>
<p>現棉情形依然滯鈍、而乏精彩、惟人心多數看好、依舊不外乎謂來源疏通無望、往後下去、存底趨减薄弱、然日廠動辦之念殊淡、不過同行互相買賣、較為熱鬧也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、市況略呈疲弱之狀、先因缺乏買戶、後因現貨交易之較靜、及受華　街股票市價之壓力、結果收盤較之上日跌八九磅音不等、印度預測跌一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來因市上存底之不豐、及棉紗價格之呆滯、交易未見活躍、大部同業俱　觀望態度、廠方因之竟有無貨可購之概、市况異常靜寂、然　價始終緊定也、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米銜接而來　新粳亦小一二元</h3>
<p>洋米接踵而來、前日（國慶日）太古公司蘇州輪自香港到滬、裝來五千六百零九包、又怡和洋行阜生輸同日到埠、亦由港運來四千一百八十九包、另有六百六十包轉往靑島、巳於昨日原船運往、昨日有怡和洋行永生輪抵埠、自香港裝來五百零一包、停羅斯福碼頭起卸、太古公司慶元輪亦昨日到滬、由香港裝來一千六百二十一包、停靠浦東本行碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米存底充足、定貸到源不絕、在外匯平鬆之際、國外新交易久經通划、而南洋問題及英美與日本之磨擦亦不足以引起進戶之興味、投機操縱者旣乏激刺市面之機緣、隨多觀望待變、以待其重行搗亂之機會來臨、因此昨市買氣甚寂、早市降小半元、午後有長義代華南企業公司拋出西貢一號一千噸、價祇七十五元半、又比雙十節前七十六元二角小去七角、人心趨軟、市上回籠原包仍無納戶、現洋米市價乃叉續削一元、比之週三晚收共小元半之譜、</p>
<p>新粳尖共到三千餘包、銷　因洋米疲跌、相隨見衰、所以售價較紀念日前貶短一二元不等、閔行新粳七十八元、西塘百　八十元、靑角杜尖六十八元、太倉洋尖獨以乏貨見俏、售六十六七元、</p>
<p>破粳市貨將罄、祇南港早稻續開高自八十一二元、次至七十六七元、</p>
<p>糯米國米亦稀、洋貨頗旺、所以價開國貨站而洋貨貶、計金溧特元仍須七十二元左右、香港特元巳祗七十一元左右、决至六十八九元、</p>
<h3>現粉軋缺　門售無貨應市</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉依然軋缺、因各廠所批有限、本街實銷因多搭食麥粉、需要頻增、常有供不敷求之虞、目下各店門售、大都無貨應市、均以少數洋粉警代、所以目下洋粉亦感缺乏、雙鷹牌每包十八元七八角、福壽牌零買價竟須十九元六角者、惟回籠老車牌棧單與華廠粉客盤、因受洋粉巨額定貨影響、暫無變動、仍為十八元四五角云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市聲靜如故、近來各地到源、以產價堅昂、及費用浩築，迄無整批運滬、而輸入租界署、更多困難、故售手頗思扳持、而廠家則無意放價吸收、結果仍為原盤零星點綴而巳、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆回跌</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆交易、雖有幾批做開、但慮　千餘包、行售巳比前挫跌一二元不等、况且各方漏網來源、絡經可抵、故大局暫須傾向疲憊之中、昨去路除出口占四分之一外、餘均為本街之胃、統計成交靑島新豆三百包、價為三十八元五角、常州牛皮黃二百包、價為三十五元五角至三十四兀、天津新豆四百餘包、價為四十八元至四十六元、大塲豆五十包、價為三十二元、及太倉豆三十包、價為三十二元五角、今日有生仁五百五十包、又芝蔴四百包運香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　食糖步降</h3>
<p>昨日糖市公會劃盤、二十四號組白本棧七十五元、外棧七月份七十四元二角、新貨討七十五元、轉口現貨五十九元、十月二十號五十八元三角至五十八元、大B七十三元二角七十三元三角、東棧七十二元七角、CX七十一元五角、DY七十一元四角、HY七十一元、東棧七十元另六七角、HW六十六元五角、荷棉白七十二元至七十一元五角、荷赤現貨五十六元、路貨五十五元六角、粗白比前小去五角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新紅黑棗　價俱上漲</h3>
<p>天津新　紅棗、近又續到數十包、價又上展、計棗王為一百元棗頭八十元、頭戶七十元、二戶六十元、</p>
<p>新黑棗茲到二高莊一百包、昨戶開出、價為七十元、市勢仍緊、尙看續升、</p>
<h3>南芡產量不豐</h3>
<p>南塘芡買、近日到貨稍增、價亦較平、行盤售過二百八十元、惟本屆出數不盛、地價未能過低不易續鬆、</p>
<h3>海味　香山尾二盤售開</h3>
<p>西洋蝦尾茲續到香山尾一批、日前售開二盤為四百零五元、查該貨較遜於前、故其價須削低六十元之鉅、</p>
<h3>白椒堅挺黑椒回軟</h3>
<p>胡椒邇來交易尙不寂寞、而白椒更形活潑，其勢堅挺、刻市文島貨售二百十元、荷蘭貨二百元、比前各升十元、惟黑椒反見回軟、一號與黑大同售一百零九元、小落三元、</p>
<h3>疋頭　布價尙穩</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市趣勢平定、蓋以棉布出路狹仄、過去不若原紗俏俐、售盤大都不敷成本、近以紗市稍有回風、布價尙穩、白貨細布細斜平平、粗布一部份跌每疋一角至二角半、漂染布亦無更動、本街成交坯布·絨布·粗布等四百餘件、粵港帮辦藍布色斜鴻章綸昌貢緞綫呢等三百餘件、北路烟台帮辦粗布色布色斜二百數十件、國外新加坡邏邏等地辦色布漂布五千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　昨白貨細布·細斜同降每疋一角半至二角半、龍頭細布晨盤高價見三十六元五角、後市收盤為三十六元二角、嗶嘰一元〇八分左右、蓋以同業人心良好、逢低收進、趨勢仍穩、</p>
<p>出口　今日有疋頭二百三十五件運烟台、九百二十件運香港、</p>
<h3>馬褲呢交易盛</h3>
<p>馬褲呢邇來交易甚盛、大批發戶按日均有售開、廠方現貨亦有開出、定貨交割增夥、蓋定製夾大衣者頻起、實銷當令、買賣殷繫、因物價昂貴致低級下檔全紗馬褲呢、市銷比之往年為旺、查市塲上各種馬褲呢趨勢、齊多不及駝斯錦為俏佳、而西貨馬褲呢、因貨底不多、市氣略好、一〇〇五普通齊喊售三十九以至四十元、怡和一至二八馬褲呢售二十五六元、章華綿羊圖為二十二元半、協新五福臨門二十七元、寅豐財神虎二十七元半、美綸聖誕老人紗貨三元五角、非西貨馬褲呢售三十元、日商申織本廠貨售二十元〇五角、</p>
<h3>藥材　益志仁回升</h3>
<p>益志仁近之續到、而去化依然活潑、故市上存底日見單薄、查前市曾由一百五十元、降至一百二十餘兀、現市已復至一百五十元、回起一十餘元、趨勢甚堅、</p>
<h3>絲茶　日美絲價頻漲　本市上漲有限</h3>
<p>前日雙十節封關、而美日絲價則繼續上漲、紐約現貨日絲漲一角至一角一分、上海絲漲六分、廣東絲漲八分昨日紐約絲價堅平、現貨遠期較前市漲六分至六分半、橫濱昨日無市、期現各貨、以九日市言、則較前日漲四十元與十九元、</p>
<p>本埠絲市、本可一帆風順、展開漲風、然日美風雲亦影響匯市、故絲價上漲有限、白廠B字售開五千一百元與五千一百五十元不等、較週初已高漲近一百元、聞英法洋行美國去路有少數成交、蓋受統制影饗、無貨應市也、</p>
<p>茶葉今日（十二日）有十件、運往香港、又五百十件、運往天津、</p>
<h3>戰後的中國蠶絲業　（續）（十）（日）</h3>
<p>— 施翔</p>
<p>（B）絲市逆境</p>
<p>本年絲市逐步後退、自春薾結束、更吿不穩、蓋歐戰之影響、已牽動整個絲業、紐約方面、逐日步跌、新絲登塲、首遭逆境、如六月中旬、紐約市塲、十三·十五條紋、每磅曾至美金二元七角五分、至八月份巳跌至二元四角五分、計每磅下跌達美金三角、（每絲一擔計重一百三十三磅、須下跌美金四十元之鉅）目下市情、雖巳稍有好境、然小廠絲已大部售罄、故獲利者已非吾人矣、</p>
<p>是時、生絲出運、復生問題、致事前拋售與滬上洋行者、無法解貨、出運既遭困難、故大都現地脫售、然售價較之上海洋行相差達五百元、現地絲商、鑒於廠商之需款孔殷、故頗多抑低售價、有一時期、每擔絲過磅後、現款僅可先支千元、餘款遲期二十天方可支取、廠方因鄉間欠款已屆燃眉、於是不顧血本、忍痛出售、以濟眉急、而是時價格每擔最高僅値四千元、合之血本每擔最少須虧蝕九百七十餘元、計算如下、</p>
<p>鮮薾價每擔三九〇元、烘折二八〇斤、開支六〇元、則每擔乾薾價為一千一百五十二元、繅成生絲一擔、須乾繭三百八十斤、則每絲一件其蔽本為四千三百七十七元、加繅工開支（即生產費）六百元則每擔絲之成本為四千九百七十七兀、而今只售得四千元、故每擔净蝕九百七十七元、　（未完）</p>

<p>傳左右談　致死原因</p>
<p>據傳之左右談、傳之死必有政治作用、因彼「過於謙遜不允赴南京作官所致」、傳平時戒備甚嚴、僱用衛士達二十三人之多、且其宅外復駐有日兵及「市警」，傅最近曾對人言、渠卽擬提出辭職、詎今不料竟為其家庭中所最親信之僕人听殺也、又據傅左右吳某對西報記者稱、在南京米委仟繼任人選前「市府」現狀、祇有聽令其停頓、</p>

<p>日兵出動　搜查行人</p>
<p>斯時傳張氏於夢中驚醒、人房探視、則傳已死於血泊中、頓起驚惶、樓下衛士、始悉其事、事後日海軍陸戰隊司令得訊、卽派大隊武裝士兵出動、在虹口區城一帶搜查行人、實施警戒、並至朱升南京路某處寓所搜查、則朱升之婦早於三星期前他遷、工部局警務處據報、亦派捕一隊至出事地點、但嗣獲來傳宅在公共租界以外、乃又中途折回、又據英文大美晚報消息、據今晨（十一日）消息、傳氏在寢室被殺時、鄰室有日籍及白俄保鑣各兩人、惟彼等未聞血案發生時有何聲響、今日淸展兇手離傳寓時、曾有附近某華人家一僕見其行色忽忽、怪而詢之、兇手謂渠因未獲工資、故巳辭職、</p>

<h3>美商銀行擠提說　全屬無稽　假日前後收解擁濟　業務蓬勃殊為發達</h3>
<p>外傳自美國務院發出公吿、勸令遠東美僑家屬，從速撤退後、本埠一般美僑、均向美商銀行提取存款一說、茲向各方調查、證明此項謠傳、並不眞確、據某銀行高級職昌稱、休假日前後、提款解款者、往柱較為擁擠、此為平常之現象、不足為異云、在此動盪不定之局勢下，銀行業務、反呈蓬勃發達之現象、華人資產階級、有將美鈔兌換法幣者、或有將法幣兌換美金者、售出購進、均依各自不同之需要行之、據華人方面一般意見、認為國務院撤退遠東美僑之提議、乃美國遠東政策愈趨張硬之一種表示、故日來法幣之價値、突見上漲、</p>

<p>達東局勢、自美國採取堅決立　維持其遠東權益後、雖日方態度、漸趨軟弱、但昨據若干外國外交界人員力面所稱、遠東局勢、現仍不因日本熊度之軟弱而和緩、此可於本埠美總領署對於辦理甚撤退僑民工作中覘之、蓋本埠美領署現仍繼續辦　其撤退僑民之工作，且據記者向美僑之權威方面獲得一獨特消息稱、本埠美海軍重要長官之在這眷屬、亦已確定日期、從事撤退回美、</p>
<p>首批美橋　定期離滬</p>
<p>關於撤退在華非必要僑民、雖羅斯福總統不予作有力之證實、但上海美總領事署巳於本月八日確接獲國務院之通知、昨日上午、據記者向美關係方面探悉美領事署對撤退僑民、刻正認眞辦理、甚第一批登記之撤退美僑、領署業已發出通吿、內容係說明關於國務院所發訓令內容、第二批通吿、日內亦將發出、準備撤退之第一批美僑泰半係寄居於公共租界滬東區內者、至於貧苦或中等階級職員眷屬美國大使館方面、將給予津貼、遺送返國撤退之美國婦孺一行、據新聲社記者察悉、準於十一月六日乘美國總統公司輪柯立芝總統輸回國、</p>
<p>美橋團體　開會討論</p>
<p>美國協會與美國商會、以官方旣接獲華盛頓國務院訓令、撇退遠東包括華北上海之僑民「節」、兩會此後應取之步驟、與如何協助官方辦理撤退事宜、有討論之必要、美國商會業於昨日下午舉行會議、對低級薪給之美僑遣散辦法、曾有詳細之決定、美國協會則於今明兩日內、由費　脫主席召集開會聞兩會方僉以撤退僑民、有增多船隻來遠　必要、將向當局請求、</p>
<p>英橋並未　準備撤退</p>
<p>英國　局、對在遠東或中國方面之僑民、有吾與美方取同梯措置、殊為各界所關切、英國總領事館消息、英官方尙無是項訓令到達、此問負責方面、亦無撤僑準備、嗣後是吾有撤僑之必要負責者以倫效官方、並無撤僑通吿、不欲有所表小、</p>
<p>美軍撤離　並未決定</p>
<p>美海軍部長諾克斯上校、在華盛頓宜示、將撤退在華之亞洲　隊與第四海軍聯隊士兵一千六　名之說、迄猶未至決定階段、性美海陸軍之充實太平洋重耍根據地如馬尼刺·檀杳山·夏威夷等地之防禦力、則實為遠東時局激動所致、萬一在滬美海軍有撤退可能、則上海原為國際件所在地、猶一九一四年世界大戰、不至有劇變、和界地位、仍保中立無疑、</p>

<h3>法租界公共交通　昨日再度停頓　臨時僱員上工突遭勸阻　各界擬調解談判未中輟</h3>
<p>法商水電公司車務部、自所屬司機售票員等發生罷工後、卽臨時招僱工人及藝徒二百餘人、充任罷工者之職位、維持電車之行駛、惟若輩大都居住南市、早出晚歸、兩星期來、尚無阻礙不意昨晨由南市赴呂班路電車廠上工時、突受罷工工人之阻止、不能上工、而該公司引擎間未參加罷工之五十餘人及機務處全體工人、亦被迫參加罷工、所有界內電車及公共汽車、遂全部停駛、聞全體罷工工人於昨日下午，齊集南市某處、召集會議、籌商向資方交涉方法、</p>
<p>調解無效</p>
<p>查該公司工人於上月二十五日發生罷工發、卽議定十六項條件、耍求資方予以答復、因該項條件須翻譯法文、故資方未能立卽答復、至三十日勞方復提先決條件六項、請求虞洽卿袁履登兩氏、於調解工潮時、向資方提出後、勞方復於本月二日向法捕房政事部請求調解、資方亦於是日答復勞方三項條件、勞方翌日冉携修改之條件前往談判、資方因故未能派人出席、致談判車陷於停頓、中間雖經有關各方從中斡旋、卒未成功、</p>
<p>條件爭點</p>
<p>又悉勞方之要求、仍爲堅持上月三十日所提之先決條件六項、其第一項「資方承認工會並月給辦公費國幣四百元」、而資方則僅承認舊工會、第二項爲稽查陳同章案無辜被覊押之二十八名、工人及罷工期內被捕工友、須一律釋放、資方因被捕工人釋放權在捕房、公司不能有所決定、其他第三項之增加工資、及第四項之增加開門人、第五項之不得藉故開除工人、第六項之罷工期內工資照給、及發給退職金等、雙方意見尚屬接近、故勞方若能對一二兩項條件讓步、則整個工潮、亦可迎刃而解矣、</p>
<p>各方關懷</p>
<p>昨據　方表示、渠等仍冀法捕房政事部及社會有力人士出任調停、至於罷工工友之生活、據稱已發給食米與各工友家屬云、又悉法捕房政事部及公共租界華董虞洽卿及魏廷榮等、鑒於茲事擴大、有礙社會治安、將迅謀一妥善之解決辦法、</p>
<p>車廠戒備</p>
<p>法租界電車公共汽車於昨晨完全停駛後、工潮又轉趨嚴重、徐家滙路該公司車棧及機務工塲等處大門、自罷工以來、亦照常開啟、修理車輛之各種工人、亦依舊出人工作、昨日則在呂班路康悌路口攔以鐵絲網、駐有法越巡捕十餘人、禁止一切行人車輛通過、凡居民欲進入呂班路者、須沿徐家滙路其他馬路折入、鐵絲網中間留一缺口、備該公司職員及巡邏之機器脚踏車出入、鐵絲網內車棧門口停有砲車一輛、各處廠門俱已下鍵關閉、情勢頗顯嚴重、惟一般悄形則尙安謐、聞雙十節晚、十六舖曾有大批車務工人及寫票失踪、同時、居住康腦脫路一百九十二號之二八二號開車、正在寓晚膳時、突來十人、將其　出戶外、該開車情急、在鳴警笛、始得脫身，</p>
<p>繼續談判</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、法商電車公司工友二千五百人之罷工風潮、迄今已歷七日、尙未解決、而維持主綫業務之司機員與售票員的二百人、今日（十一日）忽亦停止工作、參加罷工、據法商電車公司經理法佛萊今晨聲稱、勞資雙方刻仍繼續進行談判、惟關於工潮情勢、未能宣布確切消息云、法租界方面公共車輛主綫業務、今日淸晨尚賡續如常、惟電車公司外籍雇員在公館馬路八里橋路口修理電綫後、至午前八時三十分許、公共汽車完全停頓、聞本月七日勞方提出七項要求後、工潮已近解決、惟此等要求、已遭咨方拒絕、衆信今日工潮擴大、而電車與公共汽車主綫業務、皆告停頓者、乃因資方拒絕要求所致、惟今晨工潮雖再度蔓延、並未發生意外紛擾、</p>
<p>水電無虞</p>
<p>法商水電公司工潮、自昨晨電車及公共汽車怠工後、引擎間工人因過去與白俄工人糾紛、廠方未有圓滿解決、遂亦全部離廠、參加怠工、以　銅匠間引幣間工作、宣告停頓、一部份自來水廠工人、又被牽連、公司於得訊後、當卽召集白俄工人進廠接替、故引擎開及自來水廠仍照常開工、水電供應無虞、蓋公司方面極爲注意、已有準備也、</p>

<h3>編者的話</h3>
<p>關於「婦女到那裹去的問題，我們今天先發表江亦蕙女士的「我們的路」，在這小小的篇幅中，這篇文章也許是略嫌太長的，祇是我們覺得江女士從社會，國家，家庭，敎育，心理等各方面來立論，面面顧到，思想可說是相當透澈與正確的。我們覺得這是一篇不可多得的作品，每句每段，都値得各位讀者細細咀嚼的。還有許多其他的讀者的意見，當於整理後陸續發表。</p>
<p>婦女</p>
<h3>我們的路</h3>
<p>— 亦蕙</p>
<p>我是兩個孩子的母親，的確，我的大部分時間，是消耗在孩子的身上。特別是在孩子最初的一兩年的生活中，我差不多是沒有辦法從事任何負責的工作或社會活動。在母親眼見兒童日漸長成的過程所帶來的快樂裹，是句含着婦女無限的犧牲！也許有人耍說，兒童是會長大的，一個志在服務社會的婦女，在孩子進了學校的時候，不是依然可以在社會上從事各種的活動麼？可是，事實不像我們想像的那樣簡單。一個在家庭裹埋沒了五六年以上的婦女，即使是比較肯努力的，也不容易再攅進事業的圈子裹去。何况，因爲環境的關係，大多數的婦女，已早與家庭以外的社會，失去了一切的聯繫呢？婦女的一生，犧牲在家庭裹乃是個不合理的社會制度的獨特的現象。在整個的社會制度沒有合理化以前，這種現象是不能絕對消除的，但是却能藉着合理的保育兒童的機關將婦女的犧牲，减低至最低的限度。現在讓我們從婦女的自我發展社會國家的需要和兒童本身的福利三方面，來討論一下婦女爲什麼應該跳出家庭狹隘的圈子而走上社會活動的路。</p>
<p>各有所長</p>
<p>第一，從婦女本身來說，婦女的才幹正如男子一樣，是各有所長的。婦女的興趣也和男子一樣不是一致的。有些婦女在保育兒童的能力上是勝過別的婦女。也有些男子對於兒童的興趣是比婦女更深。同時，也有些婦女在科學政治或藝術上的才幹是遠勝過一般的男子。那些對於兒童特別感覺興趣的婦女，我們不但是贊成她保育自己的孩子，爲了增加社會效率起見，我們也贊成她代替別人保育孩子。因爲照管一個孩子，和照管十個孩子，在一個有專門訓練的人，是沒有多大分別的。這樣，其他的婦女，因爲有專門人才爲他們看顧孩子，各人可以安心發展展個性之所長，對於社曾有不同的貢獻。根據敎育上的調查，男子和女子在智力和興趣上的差異，同性問的差別比較兩性間的差別是顯著的多。這表示女子中有智愚之別正如男子中有智愚之別一樣。我們又何必說婦女的本分是在家庭裹呢？正如陳銘君所說，「料理家政和照顧兒女也是一種事業，」但是，正因爲它是一種事業，從事於這種事業的人，就必須有專門的訓練。我們應鼓勵一班對兒童特別感覺興趣的婦女，去受專門的育兒知識和訓練，爲社會負起偉大的育兒責任。這才是實實在在的分工合作。</p>
<p>共同奮鬬</p>
<p>第二，從國家社會的需要來說，佔人口半數的婦女，在任何國家內，我們都不能忽視她們的力量，特別是在我們這爭取自由，獨立和解放的中國。在我們努力的現階段上，多一分人力加入在民族解放的運動中去，我們離開最後的目標，便向前邁進了一步。建設新中國的艱靴的工作，是需要兩萬萬以上的婦女參加進去，才能發生有效的作用的。任何鼓勵婦女留戀在家庭的小圈子裹的企圖終必歸於失敗。因爲在二十世紀叫十年代的今天，不但是有覺悟的婦女，不願再把自己的命運交托在人家的手裹，就是有覺悟的男子，也認淸了婦女的利益是和民族的利益與大衆的利益一致的。婦女問題，正如失業問題一樣，乃是不合理社會制度所產生的問題之一。婦女與男子已不再站在對立的地位。在爭取民族解放和理想社會的實現上，他們乃是共同奮鬥的伴侶，爲要促成民族解放早日實現，婦女必定要從家　育兒的瑣事中解放出來，從事於民族解放的偉業，充當新中國建設的生力軍。婦女解放運動是要和民族解放鬥爭同時進行的。</p>
<p>集團生活</p>
<p>第三，我們都知道，兒竄最初幾年的生活，就是所謂學齡前的時期，對於十個人的終身，是有非常大的影響的。兒童日後的健康，習慣和態度，多數是要看父母在這時期敎養的方法是吾得當。從物質條件說起，兒童是需要充足的營養，陽光，空氣，大的塲子，以及各種能鍛鍊兒童的身體，發展兒童智力和想像力的玩具。但是，有幾個家庭能給兒童這樣理想的生長環境呢？說到心理環境吧，很少父母對於兒童敎育和心理曾有過研究，他們對於兒童的天性和需要，根本就沒有認識。他們不是過於嚴格，便是過於驕縱。兒童在這樣的環境中長大起來，很難成爲發展的均衡的，健全的個人。父母假如耍他們孩子長成健全的個人，最好是讓他們從小在集體的生活中長大起來。在這裹，所指的集團，便是收容初生不久到四歲的幼兒的托兒所。在它裹　，有受過專門訓練的護士，醫生，保姆和敎育家。這些人比母親更明瞭兒童的問題和需要。托兒所的一切設備和物賈環境，也是最適宜於兒童生長過程的。有這樣的一個理想的　所，做母親的，那個不願爲了孩子的幸福，把他們送去給專家敎養呢？</p>
<p>辦托兒所</p>
<p>我覺得我們當前急待解決的問題，不是婦女應不應該從家庭出來，從事各種社會活動的問題，因爲在爭取民挨解放的今天，婦女是不能不出來努力了。我們當前的問題，乃是怎樣引起社會上的人，對於托兒所的價値，有、種淸楚深刻的認識，同時，怎樣使那些對於這個問題已經有認識的人聯合起來，自願有錢出錢，有力出力，發起一個托兒所遝動。我們要趕緊訓練一班育兒的人才，建立幾處大模範的托兒所，使這個偉大的運動，普遍到全上海，以至於全中國。（聽說，上海女靑年會在不久將來有開辦托兒所的計劃，這，也許是大規模的托兒所運動的先聲。我們希望它早日實現。）</p>
<p>平等互助</p>
<p>最後，我要說的是，我希望男子不要有意地，或無意地存着封建的「男性中心」的思想和意識。夫婦的關係應當建立在平等互助的原則上。妻子應出輔助丈夫在事業上成功，丈夫也應該鼓勵妻子在事業上努力。我並不反對一個妻于「使她的丈夫從工作後的疲乏中迅速恢復，或使他從事業上的失望，受盡沮喪中重新振作。』但是，丈夫對於妻子，也應盡同樣的義務，吾則他便沒有權利作這樣的要求。同時，我也希望做妻子和做母親的人，不要僅僅把家庭看爲是我們的樂園，我們要擴大我們的眼界，放大我們的活動範圍，去創造自己和人類的幸福的將來！</p>

<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>霍桑不答，但微微點了點頭。他又問道：「我還有一句話要問你。昨夜你的汽車經過麗蘭家時，除了瞧見趙伯雄的背形伏在短牆外面以外，可還曾廳見過其他的人物？」</p>
<p>余甘棠疑遲道：「沒有什麼。我祇瞧見伊的會客室裹燈光亮着。—唉，我記得了，伊屋子的西面，好像還停着一輛汽車。」</p>
<p>「那汽車是什麼顏色的？汽車裹有沒有人？」</p>
<p>「這個我不曾留意，說不出。」</p>
<p>「那時麗蘭的會客室中有什麼人，你當然也不會瞧見。」</p>
<p>「是的，我不曾瞧見，因爲汽車駛得很快。」</p>
<p>霍桑聽到這裹，就立起身來。「好，你去罷。別的話再談。」</p>
<p>那枯坐了好久的許三也站起來挺了挺腰。</p>
<p>余甘棠也立起身來，張大了眼睛，驚喜地說道：「霍先生，你放我回由嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑搖搖頭。「不，我叫你回警廳去。」</p>
<p>余甘棠又失望了。「霍先生，你旣然相信我不會行兇，怎麼還不讓我自由？」</p>
<p>霍桑沉下了臉，答道：「自由？有這樣容易？你現在也知道自由的寳貴了嗎？可是太遲了些。你是個知識份子，竟會幹得出這種荒唐，墮落，和近於自殺的勾當。那你怎能不付代價？」</p>
<p>余甘棠作哀懇聲道：「霍先生，現在我明白了。以後我決計好好地做一個人。我旣然沒有殺人——」</p>
<p>霍桑搶着說：「你至少總有殺人的企圖。」他旋轉來，向那探員論：「許三兄，你帶着他回廳裹去罷。倪探長如果準備要向趙伯雄問供，請通知我一聲，我也想來聽聽。」</p>
<p>許三點點頭，便向余甘棠撅一撅嘴，叫他先走。那少年便懊喪地向那辦公室的門口走去。但他還沒有走出門口，那許三忽搶前一步，伸出手去攔住他。</p>
<p>許三說：「慢走，我還有一句話。霍先生，倪探長關照我通知你一聲，那陸健笙已說明他昨夜不到揚子去的原因。他在另外一個女朋友家裹打牌，地點是大沽路九號，姓干，不過這事是秘密的。他在臨走的時候，再三請求倪探長懇求你不要把他的事登在報上。倪探長已經答應他。」　（一三三）</p>

<h3>影城近事紀</h3>
<p>— 莎薇</p>
<p>貴重的壽禮</p>
<p>「風流王孫」的主角　爾遜埃第，曾經費了數個禮拜的功夫，把三十九枝蠟燭，揷入他生日的蛋糕中。這件事不知被誰傳了出去，因此奈爾遜得了許多賀　跟禮物；計幾百次電話和電報，一萬四千餘張賀片，一大堆禮物（大多數都是爆竹），及一個小孩千親自帶了禮物來恭賀。當奈爾遜在會客室接見那孩子的時候，他——那孩子不假思索地一開口就說：「這裹都是你的唱片，我用不着再開口　說了，它已代替我把要說的話都說了出來」。原來在近三年中，奈爾遜無論在影片中或電台上所唱的唱片，都被他收集了，這眞是件貴重的禮物。</p>
<p>未來的尤物</p>
<p>麗太海華滋是個很漂亮的女明星，幾個月中，有近萬的影迷寫信去向她討照片。麗太要使他或她們都不感失望，所以挖了腰包，添印大批玉照；並且分爲兩種寄出去，女影迷所得到的是一張麗太穿了運動衣和一隻小狗在一起的照片；而男影迷們所到手的，則是穿了一身緊貼的夜禮服，顯出萬分妖媚的芳影。啊，麗太海華滋眞是個未來的允物</p>
<p>漂亮的男友</p>
<p>海倫派麗許有一種郊遊的嗜好，在這些日子中，海倫一會兒和這個出去，一會兒跟那個郊遊，是從不開斷的。最近陪她出去的是兩個年靑的鄰居，一個是做演員的查理士林，另一個則是愛德華亞諾的兒子別爾。有一次當他們到達郊外時，在鄰近的桌子上，只單獨地坐了一個女的，海倫看了這種情形就很驕傲地說：「看呀，我們却多出了一個。」可是後來海倫却覺得有點難爲悄了，因爲那個女孩子的周圍，驀地裹坐滿了許多年靑而漂亮的男子啦。</p>
<p>寶蓮改樣了</p>
<p>寶蓮高黛眞是個千變萬化的女人，一年以前，從她的姿態上看去，完全像一個正在唸書的女學生。可是自從她和桃樂賽黛利奧一同出去旅行之後，寳蓮是完全改變了，她把她的長頭髮也和桃樂賽一樣，打成了辮子，端端正正梳了一個髮髻在她的頭上，臉上撲了淺藍色的香粉去遮沒她晒紅了的皮膚，夜遊用的藍色脣膏塗滿了嘴脣。把僩活潑的寳蓮完全改了個樣子。原來自那次旅行後，她和桃樂賽成了莫逆之交，兩人就一模樣的打扮　來</p>
<p>葷食與營養</p>
<p>喬奇勃倫在好萊塢，本是一個少有的不吃葷食的人，自從和「唔」女郞安秀麗丹發生羅曼斯之後，安秀麗丹對於這件事感到大大的不滿，就當面責備他不該如此，喬奇大概爲討好他的緣故吧？在他的三餐中，已可看到煮沸的洋葱，羊羔，跟猪排等物。他的身體看起來好像也比前壯健得多了。</p>

<p>上海之役</p>
<p>辛亥八月，武昌起義，他寄身上海，中心如焚，知道上海地位的扼要，並且革命的潛勢力已澎漲釗了最高峯，歷年經營，時機已熟，乃於九月十三日那一晚，在秋風悽雨的並襲中，率領着警察商團等三千人，開抵製造局，列隊猛攻，如臨大敵，那時局方的人，已經革命勢力所薰陶，思想都傾向於新政，因此躊躇不前，束手以待，月樵窺破對方的弱點，排衆直前，曉以大義，果然霎時化敵爲友，停止抵抗。月樵在那千鈞一髮的當兒，繞道後方，縱火啟鬥，歡聲雷動，蠭擁而入，一時流血遍地伏屍無算，他領導菜衆，奮勇邁進，傷及臂股數處，氣不少餒，全局旣下，退返司令部，他當衆歷述進攻的情形，娓娓不倦，鮮血從衣服中奔流而出，週身赤色，還是侃侃而談，不自覺其痛苦。事後有人嘉其勇敢的，他說，那時我已把性命交給了國家，早把自己忘掉了。革命本是犧牲，這點算不了什麼。這幾句話，說得多麼慷慨激昂，事定，陳英士督滬軍，論功行賞，授他調查部長職，他一笑却之，仍是寄情紅氍毺上，現身說法，幹他愛好的戲劇生活。</p>
<p>毀家紓難</p>
<p>那時革命的風氣，已延漫到全國，奉天革命健兒有藍天蔚，因起事失敗，來滬籌募軍餉小成，欲圖自殺，他在報上見了這段新聞，就急急的走到逆旅裹去訪問他，一見如舊，立斥三萬金，囑他冉圖大舉，這種慷慨輸將的豪舉，也是一生最得　的傑作。他曾說過，我的助友，是爲國家，友誼固重，國家更重。民元以後，受黎黃陂識拔，做過旅長，混成旅長，鹽巡統領，統稅局長，水上警察廳長等要職，可是因生性剛直，屢遭危厄，一度受制於鄭汝成，再度見厄於沈鴻英，雖然都得脫離險境，可是他的家產，從此傾蕩。總其一生，盡萃於革命事業，勇往直前，不屈不撓，精神毅力，兩皆址佩。晚年重理舊業，獻身舞台，可知仕途龐雜，那裹及得到伶工的自由。</p>

<h3>Close Contact Between the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union: Consulting on Steps for Cooperation in the Far East; Striving to Prevent the Import of Military Raw Materials into Japan; The Soviet Union Guarantees Its Unchanging Stance of Providing Financial Aid to China</h3>
<p>London - Today, it was revealed here that as a result of talks between representatives of Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, China, and the Soviet Union, an agreement for Britain and the United States to strive to prevent the import of wartime raw materials into Japan, as well as other forms of Anglo-American cooperation in the Pacific, was concluded last night. Foreign Under-Secretary Butler told the House of Commons yesterday that "very important" consultations regarding the Far East are currently underway. News arriving here from Washington stated that US Secretary of State Hull has confirmed this matter. However, Hull stated that the purpose of the talks is not to sign any formal agreements, and therefore no conclusions have been reached. Butler indicated that talks are also underway with the Soviet Union, China, and the Netherlands. Diplomatic circles believe that the US-Soviet talks held in Washington and Moscow are related to Britain. It is generally believed that the United States will act as an "intermediary" to avoid any difficulties, as the German-Soviet Union Pact exists. Direct dealings with Britain may cause difficulties. Although direct friction between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Far East seems unlikely, it is believed here that Britain is still promoting talks between the US and the Soviet Union regarding the situation in the Far East. (International Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to news from here today, the United States is seriously observing the progress of Anglo-Soviet relations and has apparently adopted a parallel strategy to promote limited diplomatic cooperation from the Soviet Union with the United States on a possible basis. Diplomatic sources say that the talks between the State Department and Soviet Ambassador to the US, Oumansky, may have discussed the Anglo-Soviet relations, which still have major contradictions. The British Prime Minister's announcement regarding the reopening of the Burma Road may be an expression to please the Soviet Union and satisfy the United States and China. They also pointed out that the Soviet Union is committed to assisting China. Now that a new diplomatic front has emerged and Britain has abandoned its past ideas and turned to face Japan, the main obstacles that previously stood between Anglo-Soviet relations can be removed. They continued to say that the Soviet commercial delegation has not yet left London. This commercial negotiation can be regarded as the first sign of concrete cooperation, and the profound impression that the Soviet Union is currently giving the world is that it has not yet made a decision between the Axis and the Democratic sides. If the Soviet Union is given sufficient inducement regarding the consequences of Japan's adherence to the Axis, it may lean towards the democratic side. Soviet newspapers do indeed support this view and have expressed friendliness towards Britain in the past few days.</p>
<p>Japanese Scrap Iron: Completely Collected</p>
<p>Tokyo - The people of Japan throughout the country are now collecting all their scrap iron and handing it over to the government in order to eliminate the impact on Japan caused by the US ban on scrap iron exports. A certain Japanese leader wrote an article in a newspaper suggesting that all iron fences, iron gates, and mosquito net iron hooks, etc., be donated to the government. Another writer advocated that all old-style iron rice threshers be handed over to be transformed into military equipment, as all farm families have this equipment, which is no longer used. It is said that this item alone can yield 600,000 tons of scrap iron. In addition, some people have suggested melting down the iron signs in front of tobacco shops in an attempt to remedy the situation. (Reuters Telegram, 11th) On the other hand, some diplomats believe that the Soviet Union may be like Italy, first showing goodwill to democratic countries and eventually joining hands with totalitarian countries. Furthermore, diplomatic observers point out that the US attitude towards Japan depends entirely on Soviet-Japanese relations, and Soviet-Japanese relations will also affect the Anglo-Soviet situation. (United Press Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>London - Reliable sources reported here last night that the Soviet Union has given Britain assurances that the Soviet Union's policy towards the Chongqing government remains unchanged. It is said that Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov told British Ambassador to Moscow Sir Stafford Cripps that the Soviet Union will continue to assist China in its war against Japan. (United Press Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>London - Soviet authorities in London today expressed satisfaction with Britain's decision to reopen the Burma Road to transport wartime materials to China. They said that the reopening of the road is a great help to China, and "the Soviet Union will naturally support anything that is beneficial to the Chinese government." (International Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>London - Yesterday in the House of Commons, former Labour MP Mander expressed anxiety that the US government had previously approved the shipment of up to one million barrels of American oil to Japan. He proposed that the US government agree to a joint Anglo-American action to block the transport of oil to Japan. Foreign Under-Secretary Butler replied that the US ban on oil exports is limited to certain types. Regarding this matter, Britain has been in contact with the United States, and the British government will definitely adopt the best policy in this environment, as the British government is well aware that it is not appropriate to supply Japan with military raw materials. Mander was still not satisfied and asked, "Can you give us a guarantee that military raw materials will not be supplied?" This is an open secret. US Secretary of State Hull has firmly announced that in the event of unfortunate consequences, Britain can definitely obtain US assistance. "The Times" stated that the Axis powers' rash actions to threaten the United States will inevitably produce the opposite effect from what they expect. The German side's propaganda of threats and inducements to the United States has completely missed its target. (Reuters Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>Ambassador Guo Speaks in London: Failure to Eliminate a Major Threat Will Leave Endless Trouble</p>
<p>London - At a banquet held by the Aid China Association to celebrate Double Tenth Day, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi said that British Prime Minister Churchill's announcement to reopen the Burma Road naturally gives China great satisfaction and reflects the public opinion of Britain and its allies overseas, including the United States and India. The policy of appeasement in the Far East should end forever from now on, as this policy has repeatedly proven to be endlessly harmful in the Far East or elsewhere. Guo urged that the first step in governing and strengthening the country is to resolve the problem of Japan, as Japan is the weakest link in the Axis chain. Japan's ability to gallop on the Far Eastern stage is only due to being allowed to do so. We can easily and effectively regard Japan as a harmful factor and eliminate it. This move will be a panacea for curing the military and moral chronic diseases in the entire world situation. Are China's doctrine and destiny more closely linked to democratic countries than ever before, or not? The House of Commons also expressed anxiety about the progress of Anglo-American cooperation in the Pacific. Independent MP Wedgwood asked whether the Soviet Union, China, and the Dutch government are cooperating with us, and whether we have the possibility of US protection of the East Indies. Butler replied that the British government fully understands the importance of contacting friendly governments on matters of common interest. The House of Commons can rest assured that certain very important talks have been underway and have not yet concluded. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Britain Decides to Reopen the Burma Road: Confirmed to Have Obtained Full US Support</p>
<p>London - "The Daily Telegraph" stated that, observing the remarks of the spokesperson of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Japan clearly does not want to protest to Britain because of the reopening of the Burma Road, or regard this matter as a sign of an immediate attack. The reason for adopting this attitude is that the occupation of Vietnam has caused the Burma Road to lose some of its previous importance. The US attitude has become increasingly tough since the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan. This is probably also one of the reasons why Japan has not shown any protest against the reopening of the Burma Road. Britain's decision to reopen the Burma Road has indeed gained the support of the US government. The world recognizes the importance of China's war of resistance in East Asia and its relationship to the entire world war. Thanks to China's courage and patience, Japan is trapped in a quagmire in China and cannot effectively strike for itself or for the Axis powers. Even those who hate China should now know that the deciding force of the nature of the situation and the trend of East Asian affairs is China, not Japan. (Reuters Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>US Navy Secretary Knox States: No Plans to Withdraw Naval Forces Stationed in China</p>
<p>Washington - US Secretary of the Navy Knox stated that yesterday's rumors that 1,600 US Marines would withdraw from Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin are not true. The United States has no such intention. He continued that the US fleet's plan to visit the west coast in stages has not been changed due to the situation in the Far East. (United Press Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington - US Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the issue of requesting American citizens in the Far East to withdraw to the country is merely a "customary precautionary measure for military zones." The rumors that the United States will withdraw American citizens from Shanghai have been denied by President Roosevelt at yesterday's White House intelligence meeting. (Haitong Telegram, 10th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Current Situation and the Residents of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, due to changes in the international situation, the Shanghai market has once again become turbulent. The majority of people either harbor fear or harbor a fluke mentality. Those who are afraid believe that once the war extends to Southeast Asia and affects the Pacific, Shanghai, besides Hong Kong, will be the most affected in terms of industry and commerce. Shanghai's original isolated island status is feared to be shaken. And the situation of Shanghai's industry and commerce under this situation may also live up to its name, occupying it exclusively in reality, with exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies causing endless harassment. Who is without the feeling of worrying about gains and losses, especially when it concerns their property and business? Looking at the future, can they guarantee that they will not be moved? Even if it doesn't reach that extreme, Shanghai originally has an international nature. In peacetime, Britain and the United States account for the majority of its power, and if the regulations are observed, the citizens can still live and work in peace. Once a strong power takes over, it will take and demand whatever it wants, and indulge in whatever it likes. The impact on all industries in between is vastly different. Therefore, everyone is uneasy and fearful, as if a great disaster is about to come. But is that really inevitable? If you consider the worries and concerns as inevitable to the future situation, then what is the use of worrying? If the worries and concerns are not necessarily true in the future, then today's worries and concerns are merely seen as excessive worry. It should be known that the Shanghai concessions are an international market. Britain, the United States, Germany, Italy, and the majority of other countries have their property rights and interests. Even though the French Concession is nominally managed by people of one country, the vested interests of all countries are probably no less than those of the International Settlement, only without the clear banner of the International Settlement. Therefore, unless all countries abandon their entire trade with China, if they do not abandon it, then no matter which country it is, it will want to maintain Shanghai's original international nature and its neutral status, and will not want to make it biased to one side, similar to exclusive occupation. Otherwise, it will not only arbitrarily destroy the treaties with the Chinese government, but also lose the opportunity for free and fair trade. This is something that all countries that value trade with China will never want to cause to themselves. Therefore, it seems too early to be worried about changing the current state of the Shanghai concessions and to have a fear in mind. Moreover, sharpening fists and rubbing palms does not necessarily mean being determined to fight to the death. Whether taking advantage of loopholes and gaps will eventually lead to a war, the opportunity and possibility of this is at most fifty-fifty.</p>
<p>As for those who have a fluke mentality due to changes in the current situation, in business, merchants value profit, and everyone wants wealth. If they have a fluke mentality, they will take advantage of this opportunity based on their assets to try to make a fortune, such as short selling and speculation, or taking advantage of the fire to rob and make so-called "national crisis money." However, in the past, national crisis money could be made because the currency value went from high to low, and commodity prices went from low to high. Comparing based on the quantity of currency, there was an obvious increase. Now, however, all goods are already expensive and may rise again, but the extent of the rise is limited, and the chance of falling can be said to be even greater. If there are both rises and falls, and you gamble in the middle, then the way of gambling is also difficult. And still holding the old belief that the way to protect assets and the art of making money is nothing more than hoarding goods, then this is called speculation. Do you not realize that "today's opportunity" is vastly different from "yesterday's opportunity," or are they the same? You must be sure of the points of difference or similarity before you can know the reasons for whether or not to speculate. Moreover, you should know that today's hoarding is not the same as in the past. In the past, everyone could contribute a small amount of capital and gather together to exchange strange plans and win profits. But now it is not the case. Taking rice as an example, with a price of more than one hundred yuan per bag of rice, hoarding a hundred bags would require ten thousand gold, and a thousand bags would require one hundred thousand gold, which is no longer something that small capital gatherings can engage in. If we take Shanghai's existing stock of 600,000 bags as a calculation of its hoarding capital, it reaches as much as fifty to sixty million yuan. May I ask, if the financial resources of fifty to sixty million yuan were entirely from the collection of small hoarders, without large financial resources manipulating it, who would believe it? Believing it and saying it is either to divert the attention of large hoarders, or to use smoke screens for hoarders to lure the public. Observing their intentions, raising prices to extract wealth is one; planning to shift the danger of hoarding to outsiders who follow suit is the second. Rice is like this, and other items such as cloth, yarn, flour, and all kinds of miscellaneous grains and oil cakes are all like this. We, on the one hand, hope that the concession authorities will severely punish them as in the past; on the other hand, we are aware that the situation is turbulent, rumors are spreading, and most of those who have some wealth are both panicked and do not know where to go, and they admire and are pleased to see those who have lost their minds and gone mad making fortunes one after another. They blindly and foolishly want to follow in the footsteps of making a fortune, but they do not know that they are simply throwing themselves into a trap. This is very pitiful. Therefore, I do not hesitate to expose it further. You must know that to adapt to this turbulent situation, you must value yourself and love yourself. Don't worry about having little money; the greatest worry is not being able to keep it, and the greatest worry is being greedy for money. Those who have never speculated and hoarded goods should not think that the situation is conducive to speculation and hoarding, and should not invite the disaster of losing their family property. Even those who have already speculated and hoarded goods should be "vigilant" for the future of the situation. Regardless of profit or loss, they should immediately dispose of it and settle it. Then, what you get in legal currency is a guarantee of a certain amount of life. Then, you can calmly observe the changes in the situation, and rumors are not enough to move your heart!</p>
<h3>The Central National Government Jointly Commemorates National Day; Chairman Lin Delivers a Speech; Encouraging the People to Strive Harder</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Party Headquarters and the National Government held a joint commemorative meeting for National Day today. Chairman Lin gave a speech, saying: "Today is the National Day of the 29th year of the Republic of China. Since the outbreak of war on July 7, 1937, this is the fourth time that we have held this Double Tenth National Day Commemorative Meeting. In this difficult and serious period, holding this most sacred and glorious founding celebration gives us infinite emotion and excitement. On the one hand, we recall the arduous efforts of the Father of the Nation and the martyrs of the Xinhai Revolution for the country and the nation. It is truly difficult to start a business, and we need to preserve it, and even more so, we need to promote and carry it forward. On the other hand, we look forward to the future of the Party and the country and the international situation, and we feel that the responsibilities we bear are extremely heavy. We must strive harder, continue the revolutionary spirit of the Xinhai year, and complete the great cause of national rejuvenation, so that we can be worthy of the Father of the Nation and the people. In his speech on the National Day of the 8th year of the Republic of China, the Father of the Nation once said, 'The cause of the revolution has not yet succeeded, and the purpose of the revolution has not yet been achieved. It still needs those who come after to continue the great cause. The Republic of China came from the revolution, so all those who acknowledge the Republic of China today must adhere to the revolutionary doctrine and strive to practice it in order to achieve the purpose of the revolution and build a country that is owned by the people, governed by the people, and enjoyed by the people, so as to leave the cause of our Chinese nation to future generations for ten thousand years. Only then will today have the value of celebrating.' The Father of the Nation also said in his lecture on nationalism, 'We must not only restore the status of the nation, but also bear a responsibility to the world. This is the true spirit of nationalism.' These precious teachings of the Father of the Nation have indicated very clearly the significance of the National Day commemoration and the guidelines for revolutionary nation-building. All of these are what we must deeply understand and earnestly follow on this National Day."</p>
<p>"And our current heavy responsibility is not only to strive for the integrity of territorial sovereignty and power, but also to give full play to the great potential power of our nation, to be a stable center in East Asia, and to fulfill our due responsibility for the world's public reason, righteousness, and true and lasting peace. Looking back on the past, the Xinhai Revolution 29 years ago, although it overthrew the Manchu Qing and established the Republic of China, because of various resistance from within and outside the country, not only from the armed uprising until the 8th year of the Republic of China, when the Father of the Nation gave a speech on National Day, he had not yet completed the cause of the revolution, let alone the purpose of the revolution. The Father of the Nation needed to show us, and even until today, 29 years later, we still have not achieved our great revolutionary cause, let alone achieved our revolutionary goals. We are still waiting for those of us who come after to complete this major task of revolutionary nation-building. Looking back on the past, we are truly infinitely ashamed. We see clearly that the reason why the revolution has not succeeded is because the two kinds of resistance from within and outside the country have not been eradicated. The entire revolutionary cause, after the Xinhai Revolution, did not have the opportunity to implement the Father of the Nation's revolutionary strategies and start very construction, so there was no way to achieve our revolutionary ideals. Therefore, everyone must be of one mind and one virtue. These two</p>
<p>, to complete the true cause of unification. All political and economic construction and national defense construction are also advancing by leaps and bounds, a thousand miles a day. It can be seen that domestic resistance is no longer a problem. The only thing that is still hindering our revolutionary progress is external resistance. If this resistance is not overcome, the revolutionary cause will not succeed for a single day, and the survival and independence of our country and nation and the justice and peace of the world will not be guaranteed. We have been fighting against Japan for three years and three months. In these more than three years of difficult times, although we have suffered great sacrifices, we have long had a firm belief that we will become stronger as we fight and we will be more confident in lasting. We will never stop halfway until we achieve final victory. I believe that all descendants of the Yellow Emperor will never be conquered. The glorious deeds of our compatriots fighting hard throughout the country are truly worthy of our admiration. In particular, our military commander's diligent planning, the heroic struggle of soldiers throughout the country, the enthusiastic donations of overseas Chinese, and</p>
<p>the spirit of sacrifice of our compatriots in the occupied areas are all praised by friendly countries around the world. When we commemorate National Day, we think of their hard work and great contributions to the country and the nation. In addition to expressing our admiration, we must express our sincere condolences to them. At the same time, we also think of the officers and men who died in the war and our martyred comrades and compatriots on all battlefields. We must express our high respect to them, comfort their bereaved families, and educate their descendants. The only spiritual comfort we can give to the officers and soldiers throughout the country who participated in the war of resistance is to tell them that the price of their struggle and sacrifice is not only to defend the independence and survival of the motherland, but also to maintain world justice and uphold the democratic system and strive for the great results of lasting peace. The light is gradually approaching, and victory will surely belong to us. In the past, our military and political authorities loudly proclaimed that China's war was almost a vanguard for the world's democratic countries, but at that time, this warning of predicting the future was only shared by a few statesmen with a long-term vision in the world. Even those who were short-sighted could not avoid mistaking it for our own propaganda. Now the facts are before us. If it were not for China's three years of resistance, the so-called "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" would probably have been realized during the tense early days of the European war. Therefore, although China's military preparations are not as good as others, it has fulfilled the responsibility of the vanguard for the democratic countries in the world. The magnitude of the impact can be imagined. This great achievement can arouse the sympathy and awareness of people all over the world. As the trend of the times, all countries will unite and proceed hand in hand towards the bright path of public reason and justice. Therefore, the significance of our struggle is not only for the independence and survival of a country and a nation. As for our self-supervision, we must still inherit the revolutionary spirit of the Father of the Nation and the martyrs and comrades and compatriots who died in the war of resistance. We must not fear difficulties or spare sacrifices. We must be determined to fight to the end. No matter how difficult the current environment is or how the international situation changes, we must believe that our great cause of rejuvenation must rely on ourselves and cannot rely on external forces. We must rise up together and follow the teachings of the Father of the Nation on National Day in the 8th year of the Republic of China to inherit the great cause, to achieve the goals of the war of resistance and nation-building in the near term, and to lay the foundation for true and lasting peace in East Asia and the world in the long term, to realize the Three Principles of the People, and to promote the Great Harmony of the world, so that we can fulfill our responsibilities as those who come after and can be worthy of this solemn celebration today.

<h3>German Air Force Exerts Utmost Effort, Intensifies Air Raids on Various Parts of Britain, Destructive Force Reaches New Peak Yesterday Morning, 36 Districts of London All Bombed</h3>
<p>London: Last night was the third night of intensified German air raids on London. The German air raid strength is increasing with time, reaching a new peak of destructive force last night. More than fifty places inside and around the British capital were bombed. By 2:30 AM on Friday, the losses from fires caused by explosions were rapidly increasing. The people of London all entered air raid shelters. Although the network of combined anti-aircraft guns was formidable, German planes were able to break through it and reach London, flying to western Wales, southeastern coastal towns of England, and other parts of the British Empire. Under this record-breaking blitz, all parts of Britain were shaken. (11th International Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Yesterday, thirty-six districts in London and its suburbs were bombed by German planes.

Anti-aircraft guns fired, and the German planes immediately scattered without dropping bombs in London. Shortly afterward, several German Messerschmitt aircraft flew very high over the coast. British fighter patrols rose to meet them, driving most of them back across the Channel. German planes strafed a certain town, but there were no casualties among the residents. During today's invasion, workers in a certain district of London saw a German plane firing at barrage balloons. Anti-aircraft guns immediately fired, and the German plane escaped, the balloon unharmed. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Last night and this morning, German planes recklessly roamed the skies over Britain all night. Over forty districts belonging to London and other places were bombed. Wales also suffered its most severe air raid in weeks, with twenty bombs landing in one district without injuring anyone. When German planes dropped flares over London to find targets, anti-aircraft guns accurately targeted them. Last night, on a clear night, fifteen flares suddenly appeared in the air. Searchlights immediately activated, and anti-aircraft guns bombarded the slowly descending flares, destroying all of them in minutes. After recklessly harassing the area all night, two more squadrons of German planes attempted to attack London again this morning, but were repelled by British fighter planes. Therefore, although London issued short-term alerts, no German planes were sighted. This morning, several squadrons of German planes circled over a city in eastern East Anglia, but were scattered by anti-aircraft fire. British fighter planes then joined the interception, and the German planes fled south, with British planes in hot pursuit. According to official reports on the recent German air raids, German planes still target London and its suburbs as their main objectives. Some parts of southern and northwestern England and southern Wales were also attacked. Fires in London and its suburbs were quickly extinguished.

<h3>U.S. Strengthens Pacific Defenses to Cope with Future Crisis, Sends National Guard to Hawaii, Naval Reserve Ordered to Mobilize</h3>
<p>Washington: The 23rd Regiment of the Marine Corps Reserve has been ordered to mobilize, assembling at several locations on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts on November 7. A regiment of anti-aircraft artillery from the California National Guard, totaling 1,200 men, has been ordered to Hawaii to supplement the 24,000 officers and men currently stationed there. James Roosevelt, son of President Roosevelt, is currently a reserve captain in the Marine Corps and is also among those being mobilized. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington: The War Department issued a statement today stating that the 251st Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment of the California National Guard has been dispatched to Hawaii to strengthen its defenses. This move adequately demonstrates that the United States has taken necessary military actions in response to the significant crisis in the Pacific. The statement was issued by Secretary of War Colonel Stimson. He issued the army's statement twenty-four hours after Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox announced that 4,800 naval officers and enlisted men had been sent to Hawaii to enhance its wartime capabilities. Colonel Stimson stated that the National Guard dispatched to Hawaii consists of 1,000 officers and men. They will first go to California to await transport and will be able to depart in a few weeks. At the same time, Colonel Stimson also stated that the War Department is considering further reinforcing the existing force of 24,000 men in Hawaii. According to officials from the War Department, the U.S. President, having been authorized by Congress to send the National Guard to any U.S. territory for "training," is now exercising his power for the first time. According to them, the National Guard sent to reinforce Hawaii will number not just one thousand, but likely one thousand two hundred men. When announcing the possible further reinforcement of Honolulu, Colonel Stimson stated, "Anti-aircraft artillery is gradually occupying an important position in present defense." He also stated that reinforcing the current garrison in the Philippines is not being considered at this time. The current policy of the government is to allow the Philippines to develop its military independently under the command of General MacArthur. Regarding this matter, General Stimson stated that General MacArthur had sent an exciting report to the War Department. (11th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: U.S. Navy Admiral Stirling recently made comments advocating that the U.S. fleet enter the Far East to blockade Japan. He stated that if Japan fought the U.S., Japan would inevitably dispatch a fleet to Hawaii. Because of the long distance, it is not suitable for the operations of many of Japan's main fleets. Those susceptible to attacks by cruisers and aircraft carriers would be the cities along the Pacific coast and the U.S. fleet anchored at Pearl Harbor. In addition, all thirty of Japan's large submarines capable of crossing the Pacific to fight would emerge and attempt to attack U.S. warships and disrupt commerce. The Japanese could even take such actions without declaring war, as they could delay the U.S. fleet's advance into the Western Pacific and allow Japan to gain ample time to occupy Singapore, the Dutch East Indies, and Hong Kong. If the U.S. were to go to war with Japan, the best strategy would be to have the U.S. fleet engage Japan as quickly as possible. If the U.S. decided to take the offensive and wanted to enter the East, the U.S. fleet would have to launch in time to allow the U.S. to use Singapore and Hong Kong. Once the U.S. occupied Singapore, it could begin a blockade of Japan. At that time, it may be necessary to use Manila as a naval and air base. Unless Germany and Italy could provide reinforcements to the Japanese Navy, Japan would already have been sold out by Hitler. In Hitler's mind, in order to eliminate British naval power, he would want to sacrifice Japan. In Hitler's view, if Japan fought the U.S., the U.S. would be unable to assist Britain, and he could then proceed to resolve the British naval and air forces. (11th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan, Weak in Spirit but Strong in Appearance, Tries to Maintain Friendship with the U.S., Matsuoka Says Tripartite Pact Not Against the U.S., Hopes the U.S. Can Stay Out of the War</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Yosuke Matsuoka issued a statement yesterday criticizing British Prime Minister Churchill's explanation for reopening the Burma Road. At the same time, Matsuoka reiterated that the intention of the military alliance Japan signed with the Berlin-Rome Axis is not entirely directed at the United States, but is merely a kind of peace objective. Matsuoka believes that Churchill's statement that the Burma Road was closed for three months was actually to allow Japan to make peace with China during this period. Matsuoka stated that the Japanese government has always been willing to maintain peace with China, and is still so at present. Churchill views the new treaty we signed with Germany and Italy as an unfortunate matter, but it is merely another method to achieve the aforementioned objective. This objective is indeed a peace objective. Matsuoka further stated, "If the United States hopes to see the dawn of peace soon appear in East Asia, I must admit that it will be difficult for this hope to be realized after Britain reopens the Burma Road, as reopening the Burma Road will cause Chiang Kai-shek to continue resisting Japan." Matsuoka further believes that the Tripartite Pact is not directed at the United States, stating, "The three countries sincerely hope that such strong countries, including the United States, and other countries that are currently neutral will not be drawn into the vortex of the European war and will not come into conflict with Japan due to the China issue or other reasons. If we further imagine the consequences, such a possible state of affairs that is sufficient to destroy humanity is enough to make us shudder." Japanese newspapers stated today that Matsuoka Yosuke's statement was issued at a significant time because it expressed friendship to the American people. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the American people currently "seem to be distorting the true intentions of the Tripartite Pact and are trending towards engaging in provocative anti-Japanese behavior." The newspaper said that Matsuoka Yosuke invited the American people to "return to normalcy." The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also pointed out that Matsuoka Yosuke desires the United States to reconsider its policy towards Japan, because only then can the United States change its involvement in the war. The United States should be responsible for the future development of the Pacific. The "Mainichi Shimbun" stated that the reopening of the Burma Road may be followed by equally tough actions by the United States against Japan. The newspaper said, "Any strengthening of U.S. anti-Japanese policy will be as dangerous as playing with fire." (11th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that the government is still satisfied with the news coming from the Far East. Britain's decision to reopen the Burma Road has received a relatively moderate response from Japan. It is generally believed that Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's speech shows a tendency to observe and adapt to changes. Matsuoka's claim that the Tripartite Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan is not directed at the United States, but intends to keep the United States out of the war, is like Matsuoka's statement that his eyebrows furrowed when he thought about fighting the U.S., which may be true. The best way to prevent war between the U.S. and Japan is to properly understand the dangers of such a development. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>London: Credible sources report that Hitler is currently preparing a joint offensive from the Balkans and Egypt, with the aim of breaking the Mediterranean blockade. The widespread speculation that German General Jodl has been appointed to command the Axis forces in Libya is being taken very seriously. It is apparent that the Italian forces there will continue to advance towards the Nile. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London: The Daily Mail's Viking correspondent, Mr. Shirto, predicted today that Italy will attack Greece, while Germany is preparing to confront Turkey via Romanian bases on the Black Sea. It is claimed that "I learned today that the Greek ambassador's reply to Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu has postponed this 'sudden change.' During the Brenner Pass Conference, Britain had already prepared for this. However, the serious situation they face is now becoming increasingly clear." (United Press, 21st)</p>
<p>Budapest: News from Bucharest indicates that diplomatic relations between Britain and Romania may be severed within twenty-four hours. German troops have already arrived in Constanța on the Black Sea and will build air and submarine bases at the mouth of the Danube. British personnel at Romanian oil refineries left the oilfields just before the German troops arrived. Italian aviators will soon arrive in Romania to reorganize the Romanian Air Force. (International News Service, 10th)</p>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: German troops conducted large-scale military operations in the Danube River region last night. They passed through Yugoslavia en route to Romania and Bulgaria. German troops have been marching in the Danube area for two days. Coincidentally, a German division recently arrived in Romania by train. Furthermore, it has been learned that German military vehicles passed through the Yugoslav capital in a continuous stream last night. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: After hearing the Axis powers' claim that the breakdown of British-Romanian diplomatic relations was only a "matter of time," British officials here began burning important documents last night. At the same time, British sources stated that British diplomats were awaiting instructions from London to prepare to withdraw to Istanbul. The highest Romanian authorities issued an announcement declaring the immediate commencement of the construction of air-raid shelters. Romania is making these preparations in fear that Britain will carry out retaliatory air strikes because Romania allowed German troops to enter the country to protect its oilfields. Meanwhile, Hitler's bodyguard commander, General Rollus, has flown to Galați to inspect Romanian defenses. Last night, diplomatic circles were also discussing completely unconfirmed reports that Germany might pass through Romania and Bulgaria to attack Turkey. (United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: The Romanian cabinet convened yesterday to discuss measures for reorganizing the Romanian army. Plans concerning the construction of barracks, underground defense works, and military highways have now been agreed upon. Conscripts from the 1940 and 1941 classes, originally scheduled to be called up next year, will now be called up early on November 20th. (Haitong Telegram, 11th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Romanian ministries related to national defense held a meeting yesterday, attended by Prime Minister Antonescu and his chief of staff. Since Romania and Germany have a new military partnership, the plans agreed upon at the meeting are of considerable significance. A communiqué stated that the meeting considered new methods for reorganizing the army and rearming, including building new warehouses to store large quantities of war materials brought by Germany, and building new air-raid shelters in Bucharest. Furthermore, it was decided to call up the 1941 class of reservists for training on November 20th and to take measures to prevent covert military sabotage, with emphasis on aviation.

<p>British Embassy Prepares to Withdraw</p>
<p>Rome: A Haitong News Agency reporter learned from reliable sources yesterday that the British Embassy in Vienna is now packing up everything in preparation for returning home. The British Embassy has also notified British nationals in Romania to prepare to return home quickly at any time. (Haitong Agency, 11th)</p>
<p>Bucharest: Although British nationals in Romania have not received concrete instructions to evacuate, British authorities have urged them to be prepared to leave the country at any time. The British Embassy and British businesses are now making preparations for any sudden changes. Diplomatic circles view the severance of British-Romanian relations as unavoidable, either because German troops may forcefully occupy Romania, or because London will decide that the position of Britons in Romania can no longer be supported. There are at least three hundred British nationals in Romania, and the British Embassy will be responsible for handling the evacuation. Although Romanian Prime Minister Antonescu reiterated his assurance to British Ambassador Hoare on Wednesday night that only small detachments of German troops were ordered to enter Romania, several towns in Romania now have numerous German officers stationed in them, busily arranging encampments and procuring military supplies. The arrogant behavior of these officers has provoked reactions in several provinces, as many leaflets have been found in the markets stating that Romania's inherent rights have been completely sold out. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Budapest: Axis personnel here expect that the Axis powers will take surprising action in the Balkans within a few days. It is generally predicted that the rapid military action will occur in the Balkans as a result of Germany dispatching troops to Romania and the British Embassy in Romania burning official documents. It is reported that the Italian Embassy in Athens has ordered Italian nationals to evacuate Greece. At the same time, Greek Prime Minister Metaxas and British Ambassador to Greece Sir Palairet discussed the future crisis. It is expected that the number of German troops arriving in Romania this weekend will increase further. The current number of German troops in Romania remains a major question. At the time of the British-Greek talks in Athens, news also came that British air force reinforcements had arrived in Cyprus. It is believed here that if Britain fails to obtain a "satisfactory" explanation from the Romanian government regarding German troop movements in Romania within another day, the breakdown of British-Romanian negotiations seems certain. (International News Service, 11th)</p>
<p>Germans Begin Migration</p>
<p>Budapest: The German consulate here is currently busy repatriating the 170,000 Germans scattered throughout Eastern Carpathia. A mixed Romanian-German committee began discussing the resettlement of 45,000 German minority members from Southern Bukovina here two days ago. The resettlement of German farmers from Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina is being carried out by the German Advance Squad. The first batch of several thousand farmers has set off in trucks, etc., and has now arrived at the port of Galați on the Danube River, from which they will travel upstream along the Danube, passing through the Yugoslav capital and returning to Germany. Another 15,000 Germans will withdraw from Northern Dobruja. However, 250,000 Germans in the Banat province and 350,000 Germans in Outer Transylvania will remain in their original locations. These minority members have already been granted the same rights as Romanians, and can hold important administrative positions in their districts and serve in the Romanian army. Mr. Miller, a British employee of the Astra Romana Oil Company, is still being detained at the police station, but it is said that after an investigation, the authorities are certain that Miller has not committed any acts of sabotage.

(Reuters, 10th)</p>

Also, British naval and coastal aircraft cooperated in attacking Brest, bombing German destroyers in the harbor. Anti-aircraft fire was quite heavy, but these German ships were still inevitably bombed by the central aircraft, and the port's docks and buildings were also damaged. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London: On Wednesday, the main targets of the British Air Force bombers' night raid were the Krupp factory in Essen, the aluminum factory in Grevenbroich, and the oil storage depot in Cologne. Other targets, such as the railway traffic in Rotterdam, Amsterdam, Vlissingen, Le Havre, Calais, and the German-Dutch border, were all bombed. Two major fires broke out in the factory area ten minutes after the Krupp factory was bombed.

<h3>Romania Continues to Expel Hungarians</h3>
<p>Budapest: According to the Hungarian semi-official news agency, Romania is still expelling Hungarians. To date, 1,150 people have been expelled. A total of 450 refugees arrived on Wednesday.

<p>Budapest: Hungarian Prime Minister Teleki spoke in parliament yesterday, protesting against Romania's treatment of expelling Hungarians after the Vienna conference. He claimed that he hoped Hungary and Romania would eventually reach an understanding, but at the same time, Hungary would act with great effort. Hungary's hopes for a reasonable understanding from Romania have not been realized, as the Romanian government has not taken action to prevent Hungarians from being mistreated. The situation that has existed for the past twenty-two years shows no signs of improvement. Hungary has therefore implemented retaliatory measures from Monday, deporting 850 people. The reason for their expulsion is not due to the deportees' own attitudes, but to the attitude of the Romanian government. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>US Government Authorities Discuss International Situation, Especially Emphasizing Pacific Problems, US Chargé d'Affaires to Berlin Recalled</h3>
<p>Washington: US President Roosevelt met with Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary of State Welles at the White House yesterday afternoon to discuss the current tense international situation. According to President Roosevelt's secretary, Mr. O'Leary, the president discussed general international situations, including various developments that could affect the situation in the Far East. He stated that senior government officials would continue to hold talks and make various discussions on the situation abroad, but Mr. O'Leary declined to express an opinion on which political situation the government authorities were particularly concerned about, but stated that the recent talks covered a very wide range. At the same time, State Department officials stated that the US Chargé d'Affaires to Berlin had been recalled home for consultations and would not return to Germany. The US Consul in Berlin will replace Mr. Kirk as Chargé d'Affaires, while Mr. Kirk, according to authoritative reports, will be appointed Chargé d'Affaires to Rome, as US Ambassador to Italy Phillips is currently on sick leave. The State Department has repeatedly stated that Mr. Kirk's recall does not have any significant political implications, and is merely a matter of routine. His appointment as Chargé d'Affaires to Rome is a temporary measure to deal with sudden changes. It is understood that President Roosevelt's meeting yesterday was due to the recent developments in the Dutch East Indies, which have attracted the President's attention. President Roosevelt also met with non-official personnel. After Pan American Airways manager Mr. Waldner told the press that he believed the situation in the Dutch East Indies was extremely serious, he was summoned by the President. According to Mr. Waldner, "Japan's demands on the Dutch East Indies and its 'New Order' plan have created an absolutely serious situation." He believes that the US taking a firm stance can counter the war in the Pacific. Pan American Airways has negotiated with the Dutch East Indies government authorities regarding the establishment of an airline route from Batavia directly to Manila by Pan American Airways. The latest report on this plan states that there has been improvement on the early realization of this plan. (United Press, 11th)</p>

<h3>The Chinese National Day After Three Years of Struggle: The Understanding That the Chinese People Should Have</h3>
<p>Today, twenty-nine years ago, under the great leadership of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation of China, and the generous sacrifice of countless martyrs who died for the country, China was able to overthrow the imperial system and establish a republic. On this Double Tenth Festival in this year when major changes are unfolding in East Asia and the world, the Chinese people, recalling the achievements of nation-building in those years, must deeply understand the goals of the Chinese revolution and nation-building, continue the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs, and do their utmost to fulfill their current great tasks. The goal of the Chinese revolution and nation-building is to realize Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People, on the one hand, to seek China's independence and freedom, and on the other hand, to promote the great spirit of China's inherent morality, to restore China's national status, and to promote peace and happiness for all mankind. China's founding in East Asia naturally requires first seeking peace and stability in East Asia, and only by ensuring the stability of the Pacific can there be a reliable guarantee of world peace. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's lifelong struggle, which is also the great ideal of nation-building of the Xinhai Revolution, is nothing more than strengthening national defense internally to seek China's freedom and equality; and stabilizing Asia externally to achieve true world peace.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese side fears the completion of this goal of the Chinese revolution and nation-building, because their consistent attempt is to control East Asia and conquer the world. If China's nation-building is completed and becomes strong, their attempt will be impossible to achieve. Therefore, the Tanaka Memorial not only says, "If you want to conquer the world, you must first conquer China," but also says, "The most frightening thing is that China is becoming increasingly aware. In the future, when China is unified, industry will inevitably develop accordingly. Therefore, it is necessary to actively seize rights in Manchuria and Mongolia, and then use Manchuria and Mongolia as the command tower to seize the benefits of all of China." This is not just Tanaka's words, but the basic national policy of the Japanese side. Since the Xinhai Revolution, Japan has continuously interfered with and undermined China's unification, economic recovery, and national defense construction. After the Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army, the attempt to obstruct China's nation-building became even more obvious. From September 18th to July 7th, they launched a large-scale attack on China. China, unable to endure it any longer, rose up to survive. The struggle of more than three years is actually to strive to realize the ideal of nation-building, and also to complete the cause of the Xinhai Revolution and realize the Three Principles of the People. It must achieve the goal of restoring sovereign independence and territorial and administrative integrity, and it must also achieve the goal of establishing international credibility, human justice, and world peace before it can be said to have completed the revolutionary mission. "Only justice in the world can never be extinguished, and justice will surely triumph over power." The Chinese people must have a thorough understanding of this on the Double Tenth Festival commemorating the founding of the nation.</p>
<p>Japan's attempts are not concealed by themselves. The Tanaka Memorial blatantly said: "Japan wants to use China's resources to conquer the Indian Ocean, Asia Minor, and Europe"; and also said: "Japan must fight the United States and the Soviet Union." Their so-called "New Order in East Asia" is to have all the countries in the Pacific submit to Japan's power and recognize it as the sole master of Asia. China understands this, so it is not only determined to fight to crush its attempt to conquer China, but also to break its dream of conquering East Asia. China is the oldest and largest country in East Asia. Without China, there is no East Asia, and the security of East Asia is deeply and closely related to China's survival. Therefore, China is determined to take the lead in stabilizing East Asia.</p>
<p>Since the European War, Japan has seen an opportunity and has advanced the "New Order in East Asia" to the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," vainly attempting to take advantage of the danger to actively advance southward. Recently, it has even concluded a tripartite alliance. This policy of going against the tide is actually an expression of its inner anxiety. China must do its best to cope with it for the sake of self-defense and nation-building. China will never tolerate the so-called "New Order in East Asia" or "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere." Any country that recognizes Japan's "leading position in Greater East Asia" will regret it one day. Because any treaty concluded with Japan regarding East Asia that is opposed by the Chinese people will be equal to a piece of waste paper and cannot have any effect. Japan's intention is really to use this tripartite alliance to end the "China Incident." As long as China perseveres to the end and never yields, this attempt will surely be shattered.</p>
<p>Looking back at the environment in which the pioneers of China's nation-building were in during the Xinhai Revolution, their difficulties were no less than today's, and what they relied on was less than one ten-thousandth of what the Chinese soldiers on the front lines have today. However, they were not afraid of death and never turned back, and finally created the Republic with bare hands. As Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "In the Battle of Huanghuagang, 300 people fought against more than 30,000 people, using pistols and bombs to resist long guns and artillery; as for the Wuchang Uprising, one person fought against 500 people. This kind of struggle is not found in the art of war in ancient and modern China and abroad, and only the history of revolution has this precedent." If the Chinese nation wants to survive in the world forever, it must follow the spirit of the martyrs, and like them, give their lives to serve the country and sacrifice everything. Only in this way can the goal of revolutionary nation-building be achieved. The spirit of those who experienced thousands of dangers, broke through thousands of difficulties, endured hunger and cold, and worked hard in the independence of the United States, the revolution in Soviet Russia, and the revival of Turkey can also be used as an example for the Chinese people.</p>
<p>China's current struggle is indeed entering a difficult stage, but it is much better than the environment at the time of the Xinhai Revolution. Because China is only fighting against one opponent, and all the countries in the world that love justice are friends of China. Everyone hopes that there will be an independent and strong China in Asia. Everyone anticipates that the development of the new China after victory will help the world's economic cooperation and help establish true world peace. Therefore, as long as the Chinese people themselves are confident and work harder from now on, any external resistance will not be an obstacle to the completion of the goal of revolutionary nation-building.</p>
<p>China's war from beginning to end is based on the position of self-reliance and self-strengthening, and strives independently to carry out its firm goal. Therefore, no matter how the international situation changes, it will be beneficial to China and will not be affected by it in the slightest. Recently, the assistance of various friendly countries to China has become more active, and the sanctions against Japan have also become more intensified. This is indeed beneficial to China's war, but the biggest intangible significance is that the evolution of the international situation is getting closer and closer to the purpose China has embraced day by day. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's ideal of saving the world will surely be recognized by the world in this great world turmoil, and will eventually be fully realized. As long as the Chinese people have confidence, any environmental difficulties can be overcome. It is necessary to work hard when the international situation is favorable, and even when the international situation is unfavorable, we must still fight to the end. Future history has already destined China's nation-building to be a success.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said on the Double Tenth Festival in 1937, "This war cannot be ended in a year and a half." Now, three years after the struggle, China's arduous struggle has been connected to the final liquidation before the world obtains the final light. The Chinese people should feel that they are truly shouldering heavy responsibilities, so they must have greater courage and patience, and more hard work and diligence, to engage in the sacred work of nation-building. The Chinese people must know that all the nation-building codes that Dr. Sun Yat-sen painstakingly taught in the past were anticipating such a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity today; they must take the following three points as preparations to encourage themselves to act: (1) Concentrate their will, enrich the Republic of China, and lay a sound political foundation. (2) Develop industries, increase production, and strive for research and creation to lay a solid and independent economic foundation. (3) Work hard to train, revitalize industry, improve weapons, develop transportation, and lay the foundation for the national defense plan set by Dr. Sun Yat-sen.</p>
<p>The people of the whole country of China, especially the leaders with knowledge and skills, recognize that the responsibility for China's revival and the responsibility for the rise and fall of East Asia and the prosperity and decline of the world are all on their shoulders. This responsibility cannot be avoided. They must stand firm and achieve the greatest and greatest cause with the determination of utmost loyalty and bravery, so that they are worthy of being the successors of Dr. Sun Yat-sen and the revolutionary martyrs, and continue the solemn mission to the nation, ancestors, East Asia, and the world.</p>

<p>Hong Kong Government Plans to Establish More British Children's Schools in Australia</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong government has always paid special attention to education. In addition to the government's public schools at all levels, it also allocates more than 17,000 pounds of funding to subsidized private schools every year. Over the years, it has cultivated many talents. However, since the situation became tense last year and the evacuation of women and children was carried out, the impact on education has been enormous. Most of the school children who receive government subsidies every year have been evacuated to Australia and other safer British colonies. After this group of school children was evacuated to Australia, because the number of people was too large, the local schools could not accommodate them as much as possible, and the transfer procedures were very troublesome, resulting in the vast majority of them dropping out of school. At the same time, the evacuation of school children in Hong Kong has caused the following problems: (1) Teachers who used to work in schools have lost their jobs due to the suspension of school affairs due to school children leaving school. (2) Indirectly affecting the income tax levied by the government on teachers' salaries is a serious issue.</p>

It is now known that most of the student rosters of various schools have been sent, so the review of student status documents will begin today based on these rosters, school by school. In addition to the fact that various schools should provide as much convenience as possible to the student status review personnel who hold proof documents, they should also number the documents of each student in advance to facilitate verification. The period for creating and submitting student rosters should have ended earlier, but for the sake of flexibility and convenience, it has been extended to the end of this month. Late submissions will not be accepted. The schools that have not created and submitted rosters will be published in various newspapers at the beginning of next month, so that the students of each school will know that the student status of their school has not been submitted to the Ministry of Education, and it will not be recognized.

<h3>補空雖起　金市所漲尙微</h3>
<p>Although short covering emerged, the gold market's gains were still minor.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash gold improved, mainly because the relationship between Japan and the United States in the Far East had slightly eased. This caused some operators to change their minds, covering their short positions at low prices, buying relentlessly. However, because money exchange firms and banks continued to sell short, the rebound was not overly strong. The market closed at 5,570 yuan, an increase of 65 yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, the off-market was firm, reaching 5,585 yuan. The total trading volume for the day was approximately 3,000 taels. Jewelry stores raised the price of gold jewelry by 10 yuan, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Rises 65 Yuan</p>
<p>The market opened 35 yuan higher than the previous day due to the slight easing of the situation in the Far East. Gold shops offered 30 taels of gold at 5,540 yuan. Subsequently, the market fell back 10 yuan due to some selling by money exchange firms and securities firms. Securities firms and banks each offered 10 taels of gold to jewelry stores, retreating to 5,530 yuan. Later, the exchange rate tightened, and a certain gold firm actively bought, and banks also bought at this time. The market soon rose to 5,595 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange rate softened, and money exchange firms aggressively sold short at high prices, while buyers cautiously observed. In addition, banks turned around and sold, and the market soon fell to a low of 5,505 yuan. Later, the exchange rate slightly tightened again, and a certain gold firm's buying interest revived, and securities firms also followed suit. The market rose again to 5,580 yuan. However, before the close, buyers decreased, and money exchange firms and floating profits were released, resulting in a closing price of 5,548 yuan. The market opened in the afternoon with jewelry stores purchasing 20 taels from money exchange firms at 5,560 yuan. Shortly thereafter, bulls from gold firms suddenly sold slightly, immediately falling to 5,535 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms and banks competed to buy, and the market rebounded to 5,570 yuan. Later, because a certain bank tended to sell short and money exchange firms also sold, the market retreated again to 5,550 yuan. Afterwards, the market rose to 5,575 yuan before the close due to securities firms and another bank competing to buy. The evening close was 5,570 yuan, an increase of 65 yuan compared to the previous day. After the close, the sentiment was stable, and the off-market traded at 5,585 yuan. The total fluctuation was 90 yuan. The selling price of cash gold from cash gold shops was more than 10 yuan higher compared to cash gold, and the purchasing price was reduced by 30 yuan. Current margin gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were few trades.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Listed 10 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The exchange rate for gold jewelry was listed 10 yuan higher at 9:30 AM, and there were no changes thereafter. Da Tong Hang revised the listing to 570 yuan, and the prices of Xin Tong Hang were similar to the previous prices. Purchases were reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>外幣都漲　日票獨落</h3>
<p>All foreign currencies rose, while Japanese currency fell alone.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw no new developments in the international situation, and public sentiment was relatively stable. Cash gold rebounded, and foreign exchange rates narrowed. British and American gold pounds rose by two yuan, while British gold notes continued to fall by one yuan due to oversupply. American gold notes rose to 16.90 yuan in the morning but soon retreated to 16.42 yuan, eventually settling at 16.70 yuan, an increase of 0.50 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes were in slightly higher demand, and the market price rose slightly. Singapore, Robi, and Philippine notes all rose by 0.10 yuan. Japanese gold notes fell sharply due to tighter relations between the United States and Japan, with increased supply from all sides. The market retreated to 1.34 yuan in the evening. Korean notes were relatively stable, remaining at the original price of 1.13 yuan in the evening.</p>
<h3>證券　內債依然興奮</h3>
<p>Securities - Domestic Bonds Still Excited</p>
<p>The grey market for securities: Yesterday, at the beginning of the market, China Trust Company No. 24 sold heavily in very large numbers. Subsequently, No. 16 absorbed them at low prices, and the rebound was strong. There were quite a few small purchases. The market has been down for five consecutive days, and there have been many short sellers, so it is not difficult for it to rise. The environment has not changed. Initially, in the morning, the prices were slowly raised by the buying from No. 16 and No. 25. Subsequently, No. 24 and No. 4 card No. 1 sold, and the market could not be sustained. Category C bonds broke through 7 yuan. Although Lianyi and Tongkang bought, Jiufeng and Xingchang still sold, so the market price could not rise. In the afternoon, new news was bullish, and No. 16 and Tongkang continued to buy. Dingkang, Hongda, and Xinfu bought one after another. Although Lianyi, Lianhe, Hengkang, and Yitai sold, the market was still in demand exceeding supply. Category C bonds exceeded 7 yuan, E-building also exceeded 7 yuan, and Category B bonds were seen again at over 60 yuan, and the situation was very good. Therefore, as a result, except for Category B bonds, which rose by 0.20 yuan, the remaining categories rose by only 0.15 to 0.45 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 100 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company were traded at a price of 21 yuan.</p>
<p>Public Industry Stock Market: No special news came during the holiday. The evening market opened very lively. Under the activity of new buyers and short covering, the market rose quite sharply. Most of the stocks with short positions had almost fully recovered the prices that had fallen on Wednesday. Trading in shares of Dutch-Indian rubber companies was not uncommon.</p>
<h3>投機詩話</h3>
<p>Speculative Poetic Talk</p>
<p>- Hu Yimeng</p>
<p>This time, due to the rumors of the evacuation of American expatriates from the Far East and the reopening of the Burma Road, the foreign stock market plunged due to public anxiety. Many people went bankrupt, which is enough to serve as a warning to those who are infatuated with foreign stocks and addicted to speculation. However, I am also one of them. Ten years of hard work were lost in an instant. In a state of utter boredom, I had no choice but to dip my brush and write poems to express my resentment, to give to my fellow enthusiasts, and to warn them for the future.</p>
<p>Ode to Foreign Stocks (Tune: Waves Washing Sand)</p>
<p>Betting on foreign stocks for gold and silver, a piece of paper as evidence, the sudden rise of a downward trend is truly frightening. Locked deep in an iron box, unable to open, it is heartbreaking to see. War clouds rise in East Asia, causing fear and panic, paradise is about to turn into a concentration camp, regretting that I lightly valued fiat currency in the first place, bringing groans of pain upon myself.</p>
<p>The Norwegian campaign caused a wild crash in foreign stocks, which could not be salvaged. The market had just turned better last week, but unexpectedly, due to the current situation, it collapsed again. I wrote this with a heavy heart! (Seven-character Quatrain)</p>
<p>A weak branch, barely sprouted after frost,</p>
<p>Skillful manipulation has initially restored its former glory,</p>
<p>The sound of reed pipes rises on the Pacific Ocean,</p>
<p>Overnight, the west wind scatters flowers again.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Market on October 9 (Seven-character Quatrain)</p>
<p>The short covering failed last time,</p>
<p>Today, there is no one to buy the sold-off shares,</p>
<p>I advise you to wash your dragon-slaying hands,</p>
<p>And quietly watch the sunset clouds over Jiangdong.</p>
<p>(Compensation)</p>
<p>London, October 10 (Thursday) - Today (October 9) and today (October 10), the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and shares of British companies in the Far East: only bank shares fluctuated. On the 9th, the share price of Mercantile Bank rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 7 pounds. The share price of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (London registration) remained at 64 pounds. The share price of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (Hong Kong registration) remained heard at 74 pounds, but there was no market to buy or sell. On the 10th, the share price of Mercantile Bank fell back by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 6 pounds, 17 shillings and 6 pence. The share price of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (London registration) fell by 6.5 pounds to 57.5 pounds, and the share price of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (Hong Kong registration) fell by 4 pounds to 70 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>英法地產派息</h3>

<h3>紗花　多空見解不同　紗市迴旋</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn - Divergent views between bulls and bears, the yarn market revolves.</p>
<p>The yarn market is still in a revolving state. Currently, there are divergent opinions in the market. The buyers say that raw cotton is firm, expensive, and bullish. The sellers say that foreign exchange rates are easing, there is a large stock of yarn, the situation is tense, and it has already risen by 400 yuan since the low point, so it may fall back a little. Therefore, the two sides are arguing fiercely. Today, 1,175 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong and 55 pieces to Yantai.</p>
<p>The market for current yarn opened with good sentiment. Buyers in the market were in high spirits. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,170 yuan. Subsequently, it was heard that Japanese yarn was mediocre, and foreign exchange rates shrank and then rose again. Therefore, although the calls were loud, there were few new buyers at high prices, and the market turned downward, falling to 1,162 yuan. However, some scalpers came out to cover their shorts, and the market improved slightly. By the time the market closed, it was still flat. The transaction volume for half a day was 4,270 bales. The price of 10-count Shuangma yarn fell by 10 yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is listed below.</p>
<h3>棉市靜寂</h3>
<p>The current cotton market remains sluggish and lacks excitement. However, most people are bullish, still believing that the sources of supply cannot be opened up, and the inventory will gradually decrease and become weaker. However, Japanese factories have little intention of operating. Only trading between colleagues is more lively.</p>
<p>Another news report on foreign cotton prices: The New York cotton market was slightly weak, first due to a lack of buyers, then due to quieter spot trading, and pressure from the stock market on Wall Street. As a result, the market closed down 8-9 pounds compared to the previous day. Indian forecasts fell by one rupee.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Trading: Trading has not been active in recent days due to the shortage of inventory on the market and the sluggish prices of cotton yarn. Most peers are in a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, factories have no cotton to buy. The market is unusually quiet, but prices remain firm.</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米銜接而來　新粳亦小一二元</h3>
<p>Grains - Imported rice arrives in succession, new japonica rice also down slightly by one or two yuan.</p>
<p>Imported rice arrives one after another. The Taikoo Company's Suzhou ship arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday (National Day), carrying 5,609 bags. Also, Jardine Matheson's Fusheng ship arrived on the same day, also carrying 4,189 bags from Hong Kong. Another 660 bags were transferred to Qingdao and shipped on the original ship yesterday. Yesterday, Jardine Matheson's Yongsheng ship arrived at the port, carrying 501 bags from Hong Kong, unloading at the Roosevelt Wharf. The Taikoo Company's Qingyuan ship also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 1,621 bags from Hong Kong, unloading at the company's wharf in Pudong (Zu).</p>
<p>The inventory of imported rice is sufficient, and fixed loans and sources of supply are continuous. With the foreign exchange market flat, new foreign transactions have been planned for a long time, and the Nanyang issue and the friction between Britain, the United States, and Japan are not enough to arouse the interest of importers. Speculators lack the opportunity to stimulate the market and are mostly waiting and seeing, waiting for the opportunity to disrupt the market again. Therefore, the market was very quiet yesterday, falling by a small half yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, Changyi, on behalf of China South Enterprise Company, sold 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 1 rice at a price of only 75.5 yuan, also down 0.70 yuan from the 76.2 yuan before Double Ten Festival. Public sentiment tended to soften, and there were no buyers for the original package rice returned to the market. The current market price of imported rice has continued to fall by one yuan, a total of one and a half yuan lower than the close on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>More than 3,000 bags of new japonica rice have arrived. Sales are declining due to the weakness of imported rice. Therefore, the selling price is 1-2 yuan lower than before the anniversary. Minhang new japonica rice is 78 yuan, Xitang Baixue rice is 80 yuan, Qingjiao Dujian rice is 68 yuan, and Taicang imported rice is the only one that is selling well due to lack of supply, selling for 66-67 yuan.</p>
<p>The market for broken japonica rice is about to run out. Only Nangang early rice continues to open high, from 81-82 yuan to 76-77 yuan.</p>
<p>National glutinous rice is also scarce, and foreign goods are very popular, so the prices of national goods are stable while the prices of foreign goods are depreciating. The price of Jinli special rice still needs about 72 yuan, and the price of Hong Kong special rice has already dropped to about 71 yuan, eventually dropping to 68-69 yuan.</p>
<h3>現粉軋缺　門售無貨應市</h3>
<p>Cash flour is in short supply, and there is no stock for sale in stores.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the current flour was still in short supply. Because the amount allocated by each factory was limited, the actual sales in the street increased due to the addition of wheat flour, and there was often a shortage of supply. Most stores currently have no stock for sale, and a small amount of imported flour is used as a substitute, so imported flour is also in short supply. Shuangying brand is 18.7-18.8 yuan per bag, and the retail price of Fushou brand is as high as 19.6 yuan. However, the purchase of returned old car brand warehouse warrants and Chinese factory flour customers has not changed due to the large orders of imported flour, remaining at 18.4-18.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat - The market was as quiet as ever yesterday. In recent days, the sources of supply from various places have been at firm and expensive production prices, and the costs have been high, so there has been no wholesale shipment to Shanghai. It is even more difficult to import into the concession, so sellers are thinking of supporting the prices, but manufacturers have no intention of lowering prices for purchases. The result is still original plate sporadic embellishment.</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆回跌</h3>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains - Soybeans Fall Back</p>
<p>Yesterday, although several batches of soybeans were traded, it is estimated that there were more than 1,000 bags. The retail price had fallen by 1-2 yuan compared to the previous price. Moreover, various sources of supply had been replenished, so the overall situation had to tend towards weakness. In addition to exports accounting for a quarter of the sales, the rest were purchases in the street. The statistics show that 300 bags of new Qingdao soybeans were sold at a price of 38.5 yuan, 200 bags of Changzhou cowhide yellow soybeans were sold at a price of 35.5 to 34 yuan, more than 400 bags of new Tianjin soybeans were sold at a price of 48 to 46 yuan, 50 bags of Dachan soybeans were sold at a price of 32 yuan, and 30 bags of Taicang soybeans were sold at a price of 32.5 yuan. Today, 550 bags of raw kernels and 400 bags of sesame seeds will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>糖市　食糖步降</h3>
<p>Sugar Market - Sugar Prices Gradually Fall</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Market Association set the price of the No. 24 group white sugar at 75 yuan for the main warehouse, 74.2 yuan for the external warehouse in July, 75 yuan for new goods, 59 yuan for transit spot goods, 58.3 yuan to 58.3 yuan for October 20, 73.2 yuan to 73.3 yuan for Large B, 72.7 yuan for Dongcang, 71.5 yuan for CX, 71.4 yuan for DY, 71 yuan for HY, 70 yuan plus 6-7 jiao for Dongcang, 66.5 yuan for HW, 72 yuan to 71.5 yuan for Dutch cotton white, and 56 yuan for Dutch red spot goods, 55.6 yuan for road goods. Coarse white was down 0.5 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3>南北貨　新紅黑棗　價俱上漲</h3>
<p>North-South Goods - New Red and Black Dates Both Rise in Price</p>
<p>New Tianjin red dates have recently arrived in dozens of bags, and the price has continued to rise. It is estimated that Jujube King is 100 yuan, Jujube Head is 80 yuan, First Household is 70 yuan, and Second Household is 60 yuan.</p>
<p>New black dates have now arrived in 100 bags from Ergaozhuang. The price opened yesterday at 70 yuan. The market is still tight and is expected to continue to rise.</p>
<h3>南芡產量不豐</h3>
<p>The production of Southern Gorgon Fruit is not abundant</p>
<p>Purchases of southern gorgon fruit have increased slightly in recent days, and the price is also relatively flat. The market price has been sold at over 280 yuan. However, the number of production this year is not high, and it is not easy for the land price to continue to ease if it cannot be too low.</p>
<h3>海味　香山尾二盤售開</h3>
<p>Seafood - Xiangshan Shrimp Tails Second Batch Sold Out</p>
<p>A batch of Xiangshan shrimp tails from the West has recently arrived. Two batches were sold for 405 yuan a few days ago. It is found that the goods are inferior to the previous batch, so the price must be reduced by as much as 60 yuan.</p>
<h3>白椒堅挺黑椒回軟</h3>
<p>White Pepper Firm, Black Pepper Softens</p>
<p>Pepper trading has not been quiet recently, and white pepper is even more active, and its trend is firm. The current market price of Wendao goods is 210 yuan, and the price of Dutch goods is 200 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan each compared to the previous price. However, black pepper has softened, and No. 1 and black Datong are sold at 109 yuan, a decrease of 3 yuan.</p>
<h3>疋頭　布價尙穩</h3>
<p>Piece Goods - Cloth Prices Still Stable</p>
<p>National Cloth - Yesterday, the trend of the cloth market was flat, because the sales of cotton cloth were narrow and not as good as the original yarn. The selling prices were mostly less than the cost. Recently, with the yarn market slightly rebounding, the cloth prices were still stable. White goods, fine cloth, fine twill, and plain cloth were flat, while some coarse cloth fell by 0.10 to 0.25 yuan per piece. There was no change in bleached and dyed cloth. The trading of grey cloth, flannel, and coarse cloth in the street was over 400 pieces. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs sold over 300 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, Hongzhang, Lun Chang, tribute satin, and woolen cloth. The North Road Yantai gangs sold over 200 pieces of coarse cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. Over 5,000 pieces of colored cloth and bleached cloth were handled from Singapore, Luoluo, and other places abroad.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth - Yesterday, white goods, fine cloth, and fine twill fell by 0.15 to 0.25 yuan per piece. The morning opening price of Longtou fine cloth was seen at a high of 36.5 yuan, and the closing price was 36.2 yuan. Serge was about 1.08 yuan, because the industry had good sentiment, buying at low prices, and the trend was still stable.</p>
<p>Export - Today, 235 pieces of piece goods will be shipped to Yantai, and 920 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>馬褲呢交易盛</h3>
<p>The Sale of Riding Breeches Fabric is Thriving</p>
<p>The trading of riding breeches fabric has been very active recently. Wholesale users sell daily, factories are currently offering their spot inventory, and the settling of future orders has increased. There are increasingly more people who are custom-making large coats, making this the season for sales. Due to the high price, the sales of the lower-grade, all-yarn riding breeches fabric are stronger than in previous years. It is found that of the various trends in the market, all types of fabrics are not as good as camel silk as far as good sales are concerned. The imported riding breeches fabric market is slightly better due to limited inventory. The price of 1005 ordinary fabric is sold for 39 to 40 yuan, the price of Ewo 1 to 28 riding breeches fabric is 25-26 yuan, the price of Zhanghua cotton sheep is 22.5 yuan, the price of Xie Xin Wufu Linmen is 27 yuan, the price of Yinfeng Caishen Hu is 27.5 yuan, and the price of Meilun Santa Claus yarn goods is 3.5 yuan. Non-Western riding breeches fabric is sold for 30 yuan, and the Japanese-owned Shenzhi Main Factory goods are sold for 20.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>藥材　益志仁回升</h3>
<p>Medicinal Materials - Yizhiren Rebounds</p>
<p>The recent shipments of Yizhiren have continued, and sales have remained brisk. Therefore, the market inventory is becoming increasingly thin. The previous market price fell from 150 yuan to just over 120 yuan, and the current market has recovered to 150 yuan, rebounding by over 10 yuan, and the trend is very firm.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Japanese and American Silk Prices Rise Frequently, Limited Rise in Local Prices</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday was the Double Tenth Festival and the market was closed, but American and Japanese silk prices continued to rise. New York spot Japanese silk rose by one dime to one dime and one cent, Shanghai silk rose by six cents, and Guangdong silk rose by eight cents. Yesterday, New York silk prices were firm and flat, with spot and forward prices rising by six to six and a half cents compared to the previous market. Yokohama had no market yesterday. Considering the futures and spot prices on the ninth, prices rose by forty yuan and nineteen yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The local silk market could have sailed smoothly and started an upward trend. However, the situation in Japan and the United States also affected the exchange rate, so the rise in silk prices was limited. White filature B-grade silk was sold at prices ranging from 5,100 yuan to 5,150 yuan, nearly 100 yuan higher than at the beginning of the week. It is said that a few transactions were made with British and French foreign firms for export to the United States, due to the impact of regulations and the lack of goods available on the market.</p>
<p>Ten cases of tea will be shipped to Hong Kong today (the 12th), and another 510 cases will be shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>China's Post-War Silk Industry (Continued) (10th)</h3>
<p>— Shi Xiang</p>
<p>(B) The Silk Market's Adversity</p>
<p>The silk market this year gradually declined. Since the end of the spring silkworm season, it has become even more unstable. The impact of the European War has affected the entire silk industry. In New York, prices have been falling daily. New silk entering the market has encountered adversity. For example, in mid-June, in the New York market, 13-15 denier silk reached US$2.75 per pound. By August, it had fallen to US$2.45, a drop of US$0.30 per pound (equivalent to a drop of US$40 per picul of silk, which weighs 133 pounds). Although the current market situation has improved slightly, most of the silk from small factories has been sold out, so we are no longer the ones profiting.</p>
<p>At that time, the issue of shipping raw silk arose again. Those who had sold to foreign firms in Shanghai beforehand were unable to deliver the goods. Because of the difficulties in shipping, most of them sold on the spot. However, the selling price was 500 yuan lower than that of foreign firms in Shanghai. Local silk merchants, seeing that manufacturers urgently needed funds, often lowered the selling price. At one point, only 1,000 yuan could be advanced in cash after weighing each picul of silk, and the remaining amount could only be collected after a delay of twenty days. Because manufacturers were facing imminent deadlines for payments in the countryside, they sold at a loss to solve their immediate needs. At that time, the highest price per picul of silk was only 4,000 yuan, which meant a loss of at least 970 yuan per picul. The calculation is as follows:</p>
<p>The price of fresh cocoons is 390 yuan per picul. After drying, this yields 280 catties. Adding 60 yuan for expenses, the price of dried cocoons per picul is 1,152 yuan. To reel one picul of raw silk requires 380 catties of dried cocoons. Therefore, the cost of one picul of silk is 4,377 yuan. Adding 600 yuan for reeling labor (i.e., production costs), the cost of each picul of silk is 4,977 yuan. However, it is now only sold for 4,000 yuan, resulting in a net loss of 977 yuan per picul.

<h3>Bloodshed in Hongkou Yesterday Morning: Rumors of Xiaoan's Assassination and Death, Tragedy Born from Within as Old Servant Murders with Knife, Japanese Side Conducts Major Search but Finds Nothing</h3>
<p>At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, a sudden assassination occurred at No. 26-2, Xiangde Road, at the intersection of Shigaota Road in Hongkou, shocking the area. The deceased was "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiaoan. It is said that the previous day was the Double Tenth Festival, and he reportedly went to the "City Government" in the morning to preside over the celebration ceremony. He gathered with relatives and friends somewhere in the evening, and returned home late after enjoying himself. Two hours after he fell asleep, he was killed by his close attendant Zhu Sheng with a sharp kitchen knife. It is rumored that he was stabbed three times, hitting the eye, jaw, and neck. The neck wound was the most fatal. After completing his objective, the murderer sneaked out of the mansion and disappeared without a trace. It is said that the Fu family has offered a reward of 50,000 yuan to capture the murderer. Anyone who provides information leading to the arrest will be rewarded with 25,000 yuan. Although Japanese soldiers and "city police" were dispatched on a large scale afterward, they found nothing.</p>
<p>Those Around Fu Talk About the Cause of Death</p>
<p>According to those around Fu, his death must have political implications, "because he was too humble and did not agree to go to Nanjing to take office." Fu usually had strict security, employing as many as 23 guards, and Japanese soldiers and "city police" were stationed outside his residence. Fu had recently told people that he was planning to resign. Unexpectedly, he was killed by the servant he trusted most in his family. Moreover, according to a Mr. Wu, a member of Fu’s circle, told Western reporters that prior to the Nanjing Committee appointing a successor, the current state of the "City Government" could only be put on hold,</p>
<p>The Residence's Security Was Extremely Tight</p>
<p>Fu, named Zongyao, courtesy name Xiaoan, was 69 years old (born in 1872) and a native of Zhenhai, Zhejiang. His Shanghai residence was previously at No. 1, Xingfu Lane, Lubaan Road in the French Concession, before moving to No. 1189, Xiafei Road. The house was purchased from a German at the lowest price during the First World War. He now resides at No. 2, Lane 26, Xianglu Road, Hongkou. He had one wife and one concubine. His first wife, Zhu, died of illness on November 25th of last year. She bore him one son and one daughter each. His eldest daughter is married to Zhu Zigui, manager of the Bank of Communications. His second son, Pinggui, is 46 years old and serves as the chief auditor of the China Exchange Bank. Pinggui's wife has nine sons and four daughters. His grown sons have also had three sons, one of whom is studying at a Japanese kindergarten. Fu's concubine, Zhang, is from North China and has been elevated to the status of wife. Fu's residence usually has extremely strict security, with more than 20 "shock troops" deployed, guarding the house day and night.</p>
<p>Three Fatal Wounds, Died on the Spot</p>
<p>Fu employed many male and female servants, but Zhu Sheng was the most trusted. Zhu, courtesy name Shengyuan, also known as Chen Zhongnan, was 42 years old and a native of Shandong. When Fu was wanted and fled to Dalian, Zhu was hired at a monthly salary of 22 yuan. Zhu has a mistress who lives somewhere on Nanjing Road. He usually either goes home or, when there are events taking place inside the residence, he stays in the “guard room.” The previous day was the Double Tenth Festival. Fu gathered with relatives and friends until midnight before returning, and fell asleep exhausted. At 4:30 AM yesterday morning, Zhu suddenly obtained a kitchen knife and entered Fu's bedroom to assassinate him, slashing at Fu's head three times, hitting the eyes, jaw, and throat. The wounds were extremely deep. Seeing that his objective had been achieved, Zhu abandoned the knife and fled.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Dispatched, Searching Pedestrians</p>
<p>At this time, Fu's wife, Zhang, woke up in a start and entered the room to investigate. She found Fu dead in a pool of blood, and became terrified. The guards downstairs then learned of the incident. After receiving the news, the commander of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces immediately dispatched a large group of armed soldiers to search pedestrians in the Hongkou area and implement a lockdown. They also went to Zhu Sheng's residence somewhere on Nanjing Road to search, but Zhu Sheng's wife had moved away three weeks earlier. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department also dispatched a team of detectives to the scene after receiving the report. However, after finding out that Fu's residence was outside the Public Concession, they turned back midway. According to the English-language "China Press" newspaper, this morning (the 11th), when Fu was killed in his bedroom, there were two Japanese and White Russian bodyguards in the neighboring room. However, they did not hear any sound when the bloodshed occurred. Today, it was said that when the murderer left Fu's residence, a servant of a nearby Chinese family saw his hurried appearance and asked him about it. The murderer said that he had resigned because he had not received his wages.</p>
<p>Trains on Both Lines Were Even Cut Off</p>
<p>After Fu was assassinated, in addition to implementing a special curfew in Hongkou, the Japanese side even ordered the suspension of trains on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways, hoping to arrest the murderer. It is noted that Fu took office as the so-called "Mayor of Shanghai" on October 16th, 1938, and it would be almost two years since then. In March of this year, he once went to Japan. He had once celebrated the first anniversary of his so-called "inauguration" last year, but the celebratory archway suddenly collapsed in a hurricane. It was said that this was an ominous sign, which has now come to pass. Fu was recently scheduled to visit Japan again for the "East Asia Metropolitan Alliance Conference," scheduled to depart on the 24th of this month, but he was killed before he could go.</p>
<p>Extraordinarily Prominent During Sun Chuanfang's Time</p>
<p>Fu had a humble background and only later became prominent. He successively served as the Director of the Gaochang Temple Manufacturing Bureau in Nanshi, the Shanghai Supervisor of the Bank of China, the General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, a High Advisor to the Ministry of Finance, the Director of the Shanghai Customs Clearing Office of the Ministry of Finance, the Chairman and General Manager of the Shanghai Commercial Bank, the General Manager of the Siming Bank, and the President of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. He was extraordinarily prominent during Sun Chuanfang's time. When the National Revolutionary Army pacified Jiangsu and Zhejiang, Fu was wanted and fled to Dalian, Japan. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, he secretly returned to Shanghai. He took office as "Mayor" on October 16th, 1938. It is said that Fu's body will be embalmed and lie in state at his residence for several days before the funeral.</p>
<p>Fu Assassinated</p>
<p>It has been found that there were four attempts to assassinate Fu. The first time was a few months after he took office in 1938, when he was suddenly shot at by a guard, but luckily was not hit. The second time was at a banquet at the International Hotel last year, when someone attempted to assassinate him at the table, but he escaped unharmed. The third time was a few months ago, when Fu was holding a Buddhist service at a temple on Gordon Road to commemorate his deceased wife, Zhu. He was attacked by a monk, but the attempt failed. The monk was caught by the guards and executed. Yesterday morning was the fourth time, when he was hacked to death by a trusted old servant. It seems that his fate was predestined. It is said that Fu's body is currently still lying in his residence.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tianduo Passes Away in Beiping, to be Commended, Jiang Lived a Pure and Self-Respecting Life, Kong Xiangxi Sends 1,000 Yuan in Condolences</h3>
<p>After Mr. Jiang Tianduo, who held important positions in the former Beijing government, passed away in Beiping last month, the central leaders deeply regretted his integrity and uprightness during his lifetime. In addition to Deputy Prime Minister Kong of the Executive Yuan sending 2,000 yuan in condolences, it is rumored that the government will issue an official commendation to promote encouragement. Jiang was a native of Huaxian, Guangdong. He studied in Japan in his early years and graduated from the law department of Waseda University. He joined the Tongmenghui and participated in the revolutionary movement. After the founding of the Republic of China, he was elected as a member of the first National Assembly. He successively served as the Vice Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, Vice Minister of Justice, Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, Minister of Justice, and President of the Water Conservancy Bureau in the former Beijing government. His entire family resided in Beiping. After the establishment of the National Government, he performed miscellaneous tasks in Shanghai. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, both the North and the South enticed him with "high positions," but he firmly refused and maintained his integrity. Last month, he rushed to Beiping to take care of his ailing mother, but suddenly contracted a serious illness and passed away at the age of 61.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hong Kong Route: Dangerous Areas, Announced by the Hong Kong Navigation Authority, Including Nine Locations Such as Xiangshan Port</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Shipping Administration announced the following dangerous areas between Hong Kong and Shanghai: (1) Dangerous areas for shelters, including Xiangshan Port, Sandu Ao, Laiyuan Bay, Ersha Bay, Nanwan Port, and Xinghua Bay. (2) Dangerous areas for underwater power drift, namely Haitan Gorge (between Ai Near Reef and Flag Island to Shuangzu Island). (3) Potentially dangerous areas, namely Biwan Port and Luqing Bay. Safety cannot be guaranteed in these areas. All navigators must consider the mine area and the possibility of floating mines. They must wait for changes in the weather before setting the course. All shipping companies operating on the Shanghai-Hong Kong route have followed this directive.</p>
<h3>Allegations of a Run on American Banks: Entirely Groundless, Busy with Deposits and Withdrawals Before and After the Holiday, Business Flourishing and Prosperous</h3>
<p>Rumors have circulated that following the U.S. State Department's public announcement advising the families of American nationals in the Far East to evacuate as quickly as possible, American nationals in Shanghai were rushing to withdraw their deposits from American banks. Inquiries from various sources have confirmed that these rumors are untrue. According to a senior staff member of a certain bank, the increased volume of deposits and withdrawals before and after the holiday is a normal phenomenon and nothing to be concerned about. Amidst the current volatile situation, banking business is in fact flourishing and prosperous. Some members of the Chinese propertied class are exchanging U.S. dollars for legal tender, while others are exchanging legal tender for U.S. dollars, buying and selling according to their individual needs. According to general opinion among the Chinese, the State Department's proposal to evacuate American nationals from the Far East is a sign of an increasingly assertive U.S. policy in the region. Consequently, the value of legal tender has suddenly risen.</p>

<h3>The U.S. Expedites Evacuation Work, First Group to Depart Next Month, Shanghai East American Community Notified by Consulate, Dependents of Naval Officers Also to Return Home</h3>
<p>Since the United States adopted a firm stance to maintain its interests in the Far East, the Japanese attitude has gradually softened. However, according to several foreign diplomatic personnel, the situation in the Far East has not eased due to Japan's softened attitude. This can be seen in the Shanghai U.S. Consulate's handling of the evacuation of American nationals. The U.S. Consulate is continuing its evacuation work. According to a unique source of information from authoritative American sources, the dependents of key U.S. naval officers in Shanghai have also confirmed dates for their evacuation back to the United States.</p>
<p>First Group of Americans Scheduled to Leave Shanghai</p>
<p>Although President Roosevelt has not strongly confirmed the evacuation of non-essential American nationals in China, the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai received notification from the State Department on the 8th of this month. Yesterday morning, reporters learned from American sources that the consulate is seriously handling the evacuation. The consulate has already issued notices to the first group of registered American evacuees, explaining the contents of the State Department's instructions. The second batch of notices will be issued within days. Most of the first group of Americans preparing to evacuate reside in the eastern district of the International Settlement. The U.S. Embassy will provide subsidies to the impoverished or middle-class employees and their families to facilitate their return home. According to a New Life News Agency reporter, a group of American women and children are scheduled to return to the United States on the American President Lines' President Coolidge on November 6th.</p>
<p>American Organizations Hold Meetings to Discuss</p>
<p>Since the American Association and the American Chamber of Commerce have received instructions from the State Department in Washington regarding the evacuation of American nationals from the Far East, including North China and Shanghai, the two organizations found it necessary to discuss the steps they should take and how they should assist the authorities in carrying out the evacuation. The American Chamber of Commerce held a meeting yesterday afternoon and made detailed decisions on how to dismiss lower-paid American employees. The American Association will be convened by Chairman Fett in the next two days. It is said that both organizations believe it is necessary to increase the number of ships to the Far East for the evacuation and will request this from the authorities.</p>
<p>British Nationals Not Preparing to Evacuate</p>
<p>The British government's attitude toward its nationals in the Far East or China is of great concern to all circles. According to the British Consulate General, the British government has not yet issued such instructions, and the responsible parties have no plans to evacuate. When asked whether it would be necessary to evacuate British nationals in the future, those in charge said that the British government in London had not issued any evacuation notices and did not wish to comment.</p>
<p>U.S. Military Withdrawal Undecided</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox's statement in Washington about withdrawing 1,600 soldiers from the Asiatic Fleet and the Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in China has not yet been finalized. However, the strengthening of the defenses of key U.S. naval and military bases in the Pacific, such as Manila, Subic Bay, and Hawaii, is indeed due to the escalating situation in the Far East. In the event of a possible withdrawal of the U.S. Navy in Shanghai, since Shanghai is an international settlement, it is unlikely to undergo drastic changes like in the First World War in 1914, and its neutral status will undoubtedly be maintained.</p>
<h3>French Concession Strengthens Military Force, Reorganizes Volunteer Corps and Special Police, Assists Garrison in Responding to Military Actions</h3>
<p>The French Consul General's office believes that the current situation has changed and the Concession is facing pressure. For this reason, it has reorganized the Volunteer Corps and the Special Police. The main points of the reorganization are as follows:</p>
<p>French Volunteer Corps</p>
<p>(1) The French Volunteer Corps of the French Concession was established in 1897 and reorganized in 1938. This reorganization is the fourth. (2) According to the new organization, all current members of the French Volunteer Corps must formally join the corps after registering. However, this is limited to those who support the Pétain government or are under French protection. Foreigners of nationalities other than French who wish to join the Volunteer Corps must have resided in the French Concession for many years, possess property, and have passed an examination by the authorities to prove their military knowledge. (3) The Volunteer Corps is organized into a regiment, consisting of A: an active regiment and B: a reserve regiment. Active duty personnel, after passing the new registration and examination, must have training in the operation of new weapons, possess military knowledge, and be well-intentioned towards the Pétain government. (4) The Volunteer Corps has one commander (currently the director of the education department of the French Municipal Council, Gu Loubao), one deputy commander, and several non-commissioned officers. (5) Weapons include heavy machine guns, light machine guns, grenade launchers, mortars, armored vehicles, automatic rifles, and pistols. (6) In the event of military action caused by foreign parties, the Volunteer Corps will assist the French garrison in Shanghai and act in concert. (7) The Volunteer Corps has never had a fixed number of personnel. Among them, 147 White Russian volunteers are incorporated into the French Police Department as paid mercenaries.</p>
<p>Special Police</p>

<h3>Nie Zhongcheng Public School Buildings to Be Returned on Schedule, School Likely to Reopen Next Year, Jewish Refugees Trying to Find Accommodation</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Nie Zhongcheng Chinese Public School on Jingzhou Road, which was leased to the Jewish Immigrant Committee and housed 2,000 German Jewish refugees, is to be vacated by the Jewish Immigrant Committee by November 1st, in accordance with the terms of the lease. Nie Zhongcheng Chinese Public School is expected to reopen next year. However, it is not known whether classes will be held at the original school on Jingzhou Road. It is said that the Municipal Council has sold the school property to a certain Japanese real estate company, but this has not been confirmed. At the same time, the Immigrant Committee has no concrete plans to accommodate these 2,000 Jewish people. It is rumored that some of them will move to the Pingliang Road refugee camp. However, most Jewish immigrants plan to do business in the central part of the International Settlement, and the Pingliang Road refugee camp is too far away to satisfy them.</p>

<h3>Public Transportation in the French Concession Halted Again Yesterday, Temporary Employees Prevented from Going to Work, All Sectors Intend to Mediate Negotiations Without Success</h3>
<p>Since the drivers and ticket sellers of the French Water and Electricity Company went on strike, they temporarily recruited more than 200 workers and apprentices to fill the positions of the strikers and maintain the operation of the trams. However, these people mostly lived in Nanshi and went out early and returned late. For two weeks, there had been no obstacles. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, when they went to the Luban Road tram depot from Nanshi, they were suddenly prevented from going to work by the striking workers. In addition, more than 50 people in the engine room of the company who had not participated in the strike and all the workers in the machine affairs office were forced to join the strike. As a result, all trams and public buses in the concession were completely suspended. It is said that all the striking workers gathered in a certain place in Nanshi yesterday afternoon and held a meeting to discuss methods of negotiating with the capitalists.</p>
<p>Mediation Fails</p>
<p>It was found that the company's workers went on strike on the 25th of last month and agreed on 16 conditions, requesting the capitalists to respond. Because the conditions had to be translated into French, the capitalists were unable to respond immediately. On the 30th, the labor side again proposed six preconditions, requesting Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng to present them to the capitalists when mediating the labor dispute. On the 2nd of this month, the labor side again requested mediation from the political affairs department of the French police station. The capitalist side also responded to three of the labor side's conditions on the same day. The labor side then carried the revised conditions for negotiation the next day. The capitalist side was unable to send anyone to attend for some reason, causing the negotiations to come to a standstill. Although relevant parties intervened to mediate, it was not successful in the end.</p>
<p>Points of Contention</p>
<p>It is also learned that the labor side's demands are still to insist on the six preconditions proposed on the 30th of last month. The first item is that "the capitalist side recognizes the union and pays office expenses of 400 yuan in national currency per month," while the capitalist side only recognizes the old union. The second item is that the 28 workers and striking workers who were unjustly detained in the case of inspector Chen Tongzhang must be released unconditionally. The capitalist side stated that the power to release the arrested workers was in the hands of the police station, and the company could not make any decisions. The opinions of both sides on the other items, such as the third item of increasing wages, the fourth item of increasing doorkeepers, the fifth item of not dismissing workers without cause, the sixth item of paying wages during the strike period, and the payment of retirement funds, are still close. Therefore, if the labor side can make concessions on the first and second items, the entire labor dispute can be resolved easily.</p>
<p>Concern from All Sides</p>
<p>It was stated by the authorities that they still hoped that the political affairs department of the French police station and influential people in society would come forward to mediate. As for the livelihood of the striking workers, it is said that rice has been distributed to the families of the workers. It is also learned that the political affairs department of the French police station and the Chinese directors of the Public Concession, Yu Qiaqing and Wei Tingrong, etc., considering that the matter is expanding and hindering social security, will quickly seek a proper solution.</p>
<p>Security at the Depot</p>
<p>After the trams and public buses in the French Concession were completely suspended yesterday morning, the labor unrest became more serious again. The main gates of the company's depot and machine workshops on Xujiahui Road, etc., have also been open as usual since the strike, and various workers repairing vehicles have also been working as usual. Yesterday, however, barbed wire was erected at the intersection of Luban Road and Kangti Road, and more than a dozen French and Vietnamese police officers were stationed there to prohibit all pedestrians and vehicles from passing through. Residents who want to enter Luban Road must enter through other roads from Xujiahui Road. A gap was left in the middle of the barbed wire for the company's employees and patrolling motorcycles to enter and exit. A gun carriage was parked at the door of the depot inside the barbed wire, and the doors of all the factories were locked, showing a rather serious situation. However, the general situation is still peaceful. It is heard that on the night of the Double Tenth Festival, a large number of transport workers and ticket writers disappeared from the Sixteenth Shop. At the same time, when a driver living at No. 192-282 Kangnao Road was having dinner at home, ten people suddenly came and dragged him out of the house. The driver was in a hurry and sounded the police whistle, which allowed him to escape.</p>
<p>Continued Negotiations</p>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, the strike of 2,500 workers of the French Tram Company has lasted for seven days and has not been resolved. The 200 drivers and ticket sellers who maintained the main line business also suddenly stopped working today (the 11th) and joined the strike. According to Mr. Fa Fulei, the manager of the French Tram Company, this morning, the labor and capital sides are still continuing negotiations, but he was unable to announce any definite news about the labor unrest. The main line business of public vehicles in the French Concession continued as usual this morning, but after foreign employees of the tram company repaired the wires at the intersection of Gongguan Road and Balizhao Road, the public buses were completely suspended at around 8:30 a.m. It is heard that after the labor side put forward seven demands on the 7th of this month, the labor unrest was close to resolution, but these demands were rejected by the capitalists. It is believed that the expansion of the labor unrest today, and the suspension of the main line business of trams and public buses, is due to the capitalists rejecting the demands. However, although the labor unrest spread again this morning, no accidents or disturbances occurred.</p>
<p>No Worry About Water and Electricity</p>
<p>After the workers in the engine room of the French Water and Electricity Company went on strike yesterday morning due to past disputes between the engine room workers and the White Russian workers, which the factory had not satisfactorily resolved, they also left the factory and joined the strike. The work in the copper shop and the coin shop was announced to be suspended. A part of the waterworks workers was also implicated. After the company received the news, it immediately summoned the White Russian workers to the factory to take over, so the engine opening and the waterworks were still operating as usual, and there was no worry about water and electricity supply. The company paid great attention to it and was prepared.</p>
<h3>Incidents of Robbery Recorded</h3>
<p>At 12:00 noon yesterday, in room 104 of the Hardoon Building on Nanjing Road, four robbers suddenly appeared. Two of the robbers took out guns to threaten the people and robbed more than 900 yuan in legal currency and more than 50 yuan in old Japanese bills before leaving.</p>
<p>Last night, a Western woman was walking along Baina Road in Shanghai when she was suddenly stopped by two robbers with guns. The robbers snatched the woman's handbag and tried to escape. The woman immediately shouted for the police to catch the robbers. The robbers turned back and fired four shots at her to warn her. The woman lay on the ground to avoid being hit. Fortunately, she was not hit. The robbers escaped without a trace with the stolen goods.</p>

<h3>Case of Assaulting American Soldiers: Japan Formally Apologizes, Willing to Have Responsible Officers Offer Apology Aboard Ship, Admiral Hart Believes No Need for Further Correspondence to Conclude Matter</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Admiral Hart, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, issued a public statement yesterday (the 10th), announcing the resolution of the unfortunate incident involving an American sailor and several Japanese military police inside the Bank of Communications Building. The statement said that on October 7, 1940, Admiral Hart received a letter from Major General Miura Saburo, Commander of the Japanese Military Police, regarding the unfortunate incident that occurred on September 28 at the Bank of Communications Building. In the letter, Miura expressed apology for the "unjustified behavior" of the Japanese military police in that incident, and offered to have the responsible officers directly apologize to the captain of the U.S.S. Augusta. Admiral Hart replied to Major General Miura on October 9, stating that since the Major General had already apologized, the separate direct apology could be waived. Furthermore, on the 8th, a Japanese warship anchored in the waters of Shuangzhi Harbor, Xiangshan Port, at 5:25 PM, sped towards the waters off Hengshan Lake, Houtou, for reconnaissance and fired eight shells towards the shore, causing no damage.</p>

<h3>Massive Copper Theft Case Involving Two Million Yuan: Perpetrator Escapes; Suspect Hides in Broadway Mansions; Police and Japanese Police Cooperate in Attempted Arrest; Japanese Military Police Firmly Request Leniency</h3>
<p>The English-language China Press reports that Swiss national Whittle has been wanted for stealing five hundred tons of copper worth two million yuan from the premises of the American trading company Swan, Culbertson &amp; Fritz, copper that was being transferred from the American firm's godown at the godown of the China Forwarding and Storage Company. Yesterday (the 10th) at 11:00 AM, a constable from the Shanghai Municipal Police and two officers from the Japanese Consular Police went to the seventeenth floor of Broadway Mansions</p>
<p>to arrest Whittle.</p>
<p>They were suddenly stopped by Japanese military police. It is understood that several years ago, the Swan, Culbertson &amp; Fritz sold coin-minting machinery to the Chinese government, and received five hundred tons of copper in payment, all packed in crates and stored in the godown of the China Forwarding and Storage Company. It was recently discovered that the copper had been stolen, and the crates had been replaced with sand. It was then discovered that Whittle had orchestrated this largest theft case. Before the theft, trucks had been seen driving to the godown at night, and then</p>
<p>driving to Hongkou</p>
<p>District. The Swiss Consul-General, upon learning of the situation, issued an arrest warrant ten days ago. However, Whittle was hiding in Hongkou, making it difficult for the Shanghai Municipal Police to arrest him. On the 10th, it was learned that Whittle was in his apartment in Broadway Mansions. A constable from the Shanghai Municipal Police, together with two officers from the Japanese Consular Police, went to the address to make the arrest. Whittle contacted his lawyer, Toune, by telephone, who then contacted the Japanese Military Police. A squad of armed Japanese military police arrived at Broadway Mansions and</p>
<p>firmly requested his release.</p>
<p>As a result, Whittle, the perpetrator of the massive theft, escaped. It has been reported that Whittle has previously been imprisoned twice for privately selling firearms and committing fraud. Furthermore, according to reliable sources, regarding the case of Swiss national Whittle stealing copper worth two million yuan, the Swiss Consul-General in Shanghai, Fontanel, stated that he was studying the steps to take, but could not comment at this time. American authorities also intend to initiate an investigation into this case, as the companies involved, Swan, Culbertson &amp; Fritz, and China Forwarding and Storage Company</p>
<p>are both American</p>
<p>firms. It is believed that Whittle is still hiding north of the Suzhou Creek. It is understood that the Shanghai Municipal Police has given up the pursuit, but if he enters the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek, he will be arrested. Sources believe that the Swiss Consul-General will submit a request to the Japanese authorities for cooperation in the arrest. Japanese military spokesmen remained silent on the matter, saying they were unaware of it.</p>
<h3>Extortion Attempt; Dong Hehai Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Zhang Yinlai, from Ningbo, operates the Zhang Xiangtai button shop at 690 Burkill Road. On the 6th of this month, Zhang received a threatening letter from gangsters, demanding 5,000 yuan in legal tender, instructing him to wrap the money in a package resembling a book, addressed to "Li," and send it to the intersection of Haining Road and North Jiangxi Road, where someone would contact him. The letter warned of consequences if he didn't comply. Zhang ignored the letter. On the 9th, he received a second letter, accusing Zhang of ignoring their warning and threatening the safety of his family if he continued to ignore them. Zhang reported the matter to the Zhabei Police Station, who dispatched detective Ma Zhong and Weng Peiyu to the designated location, accompanied by Zhang's representative, Xia Chengen. At the appointed time, Dong Hehai (aka Dong Ruhai) from Ningbo arrived to make contact and was arrested. A search of his residence at 49, Lane 348, Weihaiwei Road, uncovered envelopes and scratch paper identical to those used in the extortion letters. He was taken to the Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court. Attorney Li Zhishan of the Police brought charges against him. The defendant confessed. Judge Fu sentenced Dong to four months imprisonment and ordered the destruction of the extortion letters.</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities, in Conjunction with French Police, Seize Large Quantity of Military Supplies; Five Chinese Arrested</h3>

<h3>Daughters of Deceased Fujian Merchant Huang Zhan'ao Contest Inheritance; Request Detailed Calculation of Estate for Fair Distribution; Defendant Requests Dismissal; Adjourned Indefinitely</h3>
<p>Huang Linying (38 years old, from Min County, Fuzhou, residing at 7, Lane 164, Avenue Foch), the second wife of the late wealthy merchant Huang Zhan'ao from Min County, Fuzhou, acting as the legal representative for her daughters Huang Ruji (20 years old) and Huang Ruqi (19 years old), has retained attorney Li Zhongdao to file a lawsuit in the Second Special Court against Huang Ruchan (57 years old), Huang Rubi (50 years old, residing at 19, Lane 188, Avenue Albert), and Huang Ruhao (46 years old, residing at 15, Lane 56, Rue Foochow), all born to Huang Zhan'ao's first wife, Ji, demanding the surrender of the late father Zhan'ao's estate and a detailed accounting of the</p>
<p>entire estate,</p>
<p>and requesting that the portion to be distributed be specified and retained. They also request that Zhan'ao's will be surrendered. The facts are that the plaintiff's legal representative, Huang Linying, married the late wealthy merchant Huang Zhan'ao in 1921 as his second wife and had two daughters, Ruji and Ruqi. The first wife, Pan, bore the three brothers, Huang Ruchan, Huang Rubi, and Huang Ruhao, whom are the accused. Zhan'ao owned Hengsheng, Fuyuan, and other cloth shops in Fuzhou, 50,000 yuan worth of shares in the Shanghai Commercial Press, and the Huang Feng 嶰 shop in Shanghai, specializing in Shanghai-Fuzhou remittance services. In recent years, he also engaged in</p>
<p>the cotton and cloth business</p>
<p>in Guangzhou and Fuzhou, and owned over 800 mu of farmland and houses, totaling over three million yuan in assets. Unfortunately, in 1923, Zhan'ao was injured in a tram accident in the French Concession in Shanghai and died from his injuries. After Ruji was born, he made a will to protect the rights of his wife and daughters, with provisions for the inheritance of the plaintiffs. However, the defendants viewed this with jealousy. When the plaintiff went to the hospital to visit Zhan'ao when he was on his deathbed, she was refused by the defendants. When she saw her late father before his death, he could no longer speak. Now the defendants have divided up the estate and the property that the plaintiffs should inherit</p>
<p>has all been divided.</p>
<p>Therefore, the court is requested to order the defendants to surrender the will and report the total amount of the estate in order to present evidence for distribution according to law. The court accepted the case and, yesterday afternoon, Judge Tan Hao opened the seventh court to hear the case. First, the plaintiff's lawyer presented the facts and reasons of the case and the objects of the request. The defendants, represented by lawyer Ma Shouhua, requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Their defense was that Huang Linying, the legal representative, was Zhan'ao's concubine and not his second wife. Zhan'ao had only made a distribution list for his nephews and three sons and did not make a will. Furthermore, in 1923, women did not</p>
<p>have inheritance rights.</p>
<p>Women only had inheritance rights from 1927. All the estate was distributed in 1925, and the plaintiff signed on that occasion. However, the distribution list only specified the three defendant brothers and that a house was built for the plaintiff at a cost of 10,000 yuan. If she remained chaste, a chastity arch would be built to honor her after her death. The court examined the statements and ordered a postponement, instructing the defendant to submit the distribution list for review before further examination.</p>
<h3>Bomb Thrown into Gambling Den at Hotel des Nations; One Gambler Injured</h3>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>According to Mr. Lu Zhenqing, Director of the Sino-Western Sanatorium, the news report in the Shen Bao on October 4 regarding the lawsuit filed by Li Yuying's father to recover funeral expenses, contained elements that implicated him. Specifically, the report stated that "Lu Zhenqing withheld 8,700 yuan in cash and gold jewelry and clothing worth 100 yuan left by Li Yuying, refusing to return them to the deceased's parents, which led Li Shizhen, the deceased's father, to file a lawsuit against Lu in the Second Special Court, which is currently being audited by an accountant." However, Li Yuying's belongings were kept in the sanatorium at the request of the China Funeral Home for provisional attachment, and sealed by the Second Special District Court. It was not that Lu Zhenqing was withholding them. The deceased's parents filed a lawsuit for evidence preservation in the Second Special District Court. All the sanatorium's books and records were investigated and verified by the court and returned to the sanatorium. There was no lawsuit in the Civil Court. Past reports in various newspapers regarding the death of Li Yuying were largely inconsistent with the facts. The undersigned, as attorneys, always uphold fairness and impartiality in correcting inaccurate records, not only for the gratitude of Lu Zhenqing alone, but also to ensure that the truth is published for the benefit of society.

<h3>Editor's Note</h3>
<p>Regarding the "Where Should Women Go?" question, we are first publishing Ms. Jiang Yihui's "Our Path" today. In this small space, this article may seem a bit long, but we feel that Ms. Jiang's arguments from social, national, family, educational, psychological, and other perspectives are well-rounded and her thinking is quite thorough and correct. We believe that this is a rare work, with every sentence and paragraph worthy of careful consideration by our readers. We will publish the opinions of many other readers after organizing them in succession.</p>
<p>Women</p>
<h3>Our Path</h3>
<p>— Yihui</p>
<p>I am the mother of two children. Indeed, most of my time is spent on my children. Especially in the first year or two of a child's life, it is almost impossible for me to engage in any responsible work or social activities. In the joy that a mother sees in her children's daily growth, there is an expression of the infinite sacrifice of women! Perhaps some would say that children will grow up, and a woman who aspires to serve society can still engage in various activities in society when her children enter school, right? However, the reality is not as simple as we imagine. A woman who has been immersed in her family for five or six years or more, even if she is relatively willing to work hard, will not easily re-enter the circle of career. Moreover, due to environmental factors, most women have already lost all contact with the society outside the family, right? A woman's life sacrificed in the family is a unique phenomenon of an unreasonable social system. Before the entire social system is rationalized, this phenomenon cannot be completely eliminated, but it can be reduced to a minimum by means of rational child care institutions. Now let us discuss from the three aspects of women's self-development, the needs of society and the country, and the welfare of the children themselves, why women should jump out of the narrow circle of the family and embark on the path of social activity.</p>
<p>Each Has Its Own Strengths</p>
<p>First, from the perspective of women themselves, women's talents, like men's, have their own strengths. Women's interests are not consistent like men's. Some women are better than others at caring for children. Some men have a deeper interest in children than women. At the same time, some women have talents in science, politics, or art that far surpass ordinary men. For those women who are particularly interested in children, we not only agree that she should care for her own children, but also, in order to increase social efficiency, we also agree that she should care for other people's children on behalf of others. Because taking care of one child and taking care of ten children makes no big difference to a person who has special training. In this way, other women, because there are specialists to take care of their children for them, can develop their individual strengths with peace of mind and make different contributions to society. According to educational surveys, the difference in intelligence and interest between men and women, the difference between the same gender is significantly greater than the difference between the two genders. This indicates that there is a difference between intelligence and stupidity among women, just as there is a difference between intelligence and stupidity among men. Why should we say that women's duty is in the home? As Chen Mingjun said, "Managing housework and taking care of children is also a career," but precisely because it is a career, those who engage in this career must have specialized training. We should encourage a group of women who are particularly interested in children to receive specialized knowledge and training in childcare and to take on the great responsibility of childcare for society. This is truly division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>Fight Together</p>
<p>Second, from the perspective of the needs of the country and society, women, who account for half of the population, cannot be ignored in any country, especially in China, which is striving for freedom, independence, and liberation. At the current stage of our efforts, every additional person joining the national liberation movement will bring us one step closer to the final goal. The arduous work of building a new China requires the participation of more than 200 million women to be effective. Any attempt to encourage women to linger in the small circle of the family is doomed to failure. Because in the 1940s of the twentieth century, not only conscious women are no longer willing to entrust their fate to the hands of others, but conscious men have also recognized that women's interests are consistent with the interests of the nation and the interests of the public. The women's problem, like the unemployment problem, is one of the problems caused by an unreasonable social system. Women and men no longer stand in opposition. In the struggle for national liberation and the realization of an ideal society, they are partners fighting together. In order to promote the early realization of national liberation, women must be liberated from the trivial matters of family childcare and engage in the great cause of national liberation, serving as the vanguard of the construction of a new China. The women's liberation movement must be carried out simultaneously with the national liberation struggle.</p>
<p>Group Living</p>
<p>Third, we all know that the first few years of a child's life, the so-called pre-school age, has a very great impact on the entire life of an individual. A child's future health, habits, and attitudes largely depend on whether the parents' methods of education at this time are appropriate. From a material perspective, children need sufficient nutrition, sunlight, air, large spaces, and various toys that can exercise their bodies, develop their intelligence, and stimulate their imaginations. However, how many families can provide children with such an ideal growing environment? Speaking of the psychological environment, few parents have ever studied child education and psychology, and they have no understanding of the nature and needs of children. They are either too strict or too indulgent. Children who grow up in such an environment will hardly become well-balanced, healthy individuals. If parents want their children to grow into healthy individuals, it is best to let them grow up in collective living from an early age. Here, the group referred to is the nursery that accommodates infants from shortly after birth to four years of age. In it, there are specially trained nurses, doctors, nannies, and educators. These people understand the problems and needs of children better than mothers. All the facilities and material environment of the nursery are also most suitable for children's growth process. With such an ideal nursery, which mother would not be willing to send her children to be raised by experts for the sake of their happiness?</p>
<p>Run Nurseries</p>
<p>I feel that the problem that urgently needs to be solved at present is not whether women should come out of the family and engage in various social activities, because in today's struggle for national liberation, women cannot but come out to work hard. Our current problem is how to arouse people in society to have a clear and profound understanding of the value of nurseries, and at the same time, how to unite those who already have an understanding of this issue to voluntarily contribute money and effort to launch a nursery movement. We must hurry up to train a group of childcare talents and establish several large-scale model nurseries, so that this great movement can spread throughout Shanghai and even throughout China. (I heard that the Shanghai YWCA will have plans to open nurseries in the near future. This may be the harbinger of a large-scale nursery movement. We hope it will be realized soon.)</p>
<p>Equality and Mutual Assistance</p>
<p>Finally, I want to say that I hope that men do not intentionally or unintentionally harbor feudal "male-centered" thoughts and consciousness. The relationship between husband and wife should be based on the principle of equality and mutual assistance. Wives should assist their husbands in succeeding in their careers, and husbands should also encourage their wives to work hard in their careers. I am not opposed to a wife "quickly recovering her husband from fatigue after work, or revitalizing him from disappointment and frustration in his career." However, husbands should also fulfill the same obligations to their wives, otherwise they have no right to make such demands. At the same time, I also hope that wives and mothers do not only see the family as our paradise. We must broaden our horizons and expand our scope of activities to create a happy future for ourselves and mankind!</p>

<p>Hawthorne's Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Hawthorne didn't answer, but nodded slightly. He then asked, "I have one more question to ask you. Last night, when your car passed the Lilan's house, besides seeing Zhao Boxiong's back figure crouching outside the short wall, did you hear any other people?"</p>
<p>Yu Gantang hesitated and said, "Nothing. I only saw the lights on in her reception room. —Ah, I remember, it seemed like there was a car parked on the west side of her house."</p>
<p>"What color was the car? Was there anyone in the car?"</p>
<p>"I didn't pay attention to that, I can't say."</p>
<p>"You certainly wouldn't have seen anyone in Lilan's reception room at that time either."</p>
<p>"That's right, I didn't see them because the car was driving very fast."</p>
<p>Hearing this, Hawthorne stood up. "Alright, you can go now. We'll talk about other things later."</p>
<p>Xu San, who had been sitting there listlessly for a long time, also stood up and stretched his back.</p>
<p>Yu Gantang also stood up, his eyes widened, and he said in surprise, "Mr. Hawthorne, are you letting me go free?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne shook his head. "No, I'm telling you to go back to the police station."</p>
<p>Yu Gantang was disappointed again. "Mr. Hawthorne, since you believe I didn't commit the crime, why don't you let me go free?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne's face darkened, and he replied, "Freedom? Is it that easy? Do you now know the value of freedom? But it's too late. You're an intellectual, how could you do such absurd, degenerate, and almost suicidal things? How can you not pay the price?"</p>
<p>Yu Gantang pleaded, "Mr. Hawthorne, now I understand. I'm determined to be a good person from now on. Since I didn't kill anyone—"</p>
<p>Hawthorne interrupted, "You at least had the intention to kill." He turned to the detective and said, "Brother Xu San, take him back to the station. If Detective Ni is preparing to question Zhao Boxiong, please notify me, I'd like to listen as well."</p>
<p>Xu San nodded, then pursed his lips at Yu Gantang, telling him to go first. The young man dejectedly walked towards the door of the office. But before he could walk out the door, Xu San suddenly stepped forward and reached out to stop him.</p>
<p>Xu San said, "Wait a minute, I have one more thing to say. Mr. Hawthorne, Detective Ni instructed me to inform you that Lu Jiansheng has explained why he didn't go to Yangzi last night. He was playing mahjong at another girlfriend's house, located at 9 Dagu Road, surnamed Gan, but this is a secret. When he left, he repeatedly asked Detective Ni to plead with you not to publish his matter in the newspaper. Detective Ni has already agreed to him." (133)</p>

<p>A Precious Birthday Gift</p>
<p>Nelson Eddy, the star of "The Merry Widow," spent weeks inserting thirty-nine candles into his birthday cake. Someone must have spread the word, as Nelson received many congratulatory notes and gifts: hundreds of phone calls and telegrams, over fourteen thousand cards, a pile of gifts (mostly firecrackers), and a child who personally brought a gift to congratulate him. When Nelson met the child in the reception room, the child said without hesitation, "All your records are here, I don't need to say anything more, they've already said what I wanted to say for me." It turned out that the child had collected all of Nelson's records from films and radio performances in the past three years, making it a truly precious gift.</p>
<p>A Future Femme Fatale</p>
<p>Rita Hayworth is a very beautiful actress. In the past few months, nearly ten thousand fans have written to her asking for photos. Rita, wanting to avoid disappointing any of them, dug into her own pocket to print a large number of her portraits, dividing them into two types to send out. Female fans received a photo of Rita wearing sportswear with a puppy, while male fans received a photo of her wearing a tight-fitting evening gown, showing her charming beauty. Ah, Rita Hayworth is truly a future femme fatale.</p>
<p>Handsome Boyfriends</p>
<p>Helen Parrish has a hobby of going on outings. These days, Helen is constantly going out with one person or another. Recently, she has been accompanied by two young neighbors, one being the actor Charles Lamarr, and the other being Bert, the son of Edward Arnold. Once, when they arrived in the suburbs, there was only a woman sitting alone at a nearby table. Helen proudly said when she saw this situation, "Look, we have one more." But later, Helen felt a bit embarrassed, because suddenly many young and handsome men were sitting around the girl.</p>
<p>Paulette Has Changed</p>
<p>Paulette Goddard is truly a woman of a thousand faces. A year ago, from her appearance, she looked completely like a female student who was still studying. But since she traveled with Dorothy Dandridge, Paulette has completely changed. She braids her long hair like Dorothy, neatly combing a bun on her head, applying light blue face powder to cover her sun-reddened skin, and applying blue lipstick for evening outings. She completely changed the lively Paulette. It turned out that after that trip, she and Dorothy became close friends, and they dressed up in the same way.</p>
<p>Meat and Nutrition</p>
<p>George Brent in Hollywood was a rare vegetarian. Since his romance with the "Oomph Girl" Ann Sheridan, Ann Sheridan felt greatly dissatisfied with this and directly criticized him for not doing so. George, probably to please her, now includes boiled onions, lamb, and pork chops in his meals. He seems to look stronger than before.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Revolutionary Artist Pan Yueqiao (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— By Sick Dove</p>
<p>The Battle of Shanghai</p>
<p>In August of the Xinhai year, the Wuchang Uprising broke out. He was in Shanghai, his heart burning. Knowing the strategic importance of Shanghai and that the potential revolutionary force had surged to its peak, after years of preparation, the time was ripe. On the night of September 13th, amidst the bleak autumn wind and rain, he led three thousand people including police and merchants to the Shanghai Arsenal, launching a fierce attack as if facing a formidable enemy. At that time, the people in the bureau had been influenced by the revolutionary forces, and their thoughts were inclined towards the new government, so they hesitated and waited with their hands tied. Yueqiao saw through the opponent's weakness, stepped forward in the face of the crowd, and explained the great cause. Sure enough, in an instant, enemies turned into friends, and they stopped resisting. At that critical moment, Yueqiao detoured to the rear, set fire to start a fight, and cheers erupted. They poured in like bees, with blood flowing everywhere and countless corpses. He led the crowd, advancing bravely, injured in the arms and legs in several places, but his spirit did not diminish. After the entire situation was under control, he returned to the headquarters. He recounted the details of the attack to the crowd, tirelessly, with fresh blood flowing from his clothes, his whole body red, yet he still talked eloquently, unaware of his pain. Afterwards, some praised his courage. He said, "At that time, I had already given my life to the country, and had long forgotten myself. Revolution is a sacrifice, this is nothing." These words were so慷慨激昂. After the matter was settled, Chen Qimei supervised the Shanghai army and awarded him the position of Minister of Investigation. He smiled and declined, still devoting himself to the stage, using his life to advocate and do his beloved drama life.</p>
<p>Destroying the Home to Alleviate Difficulties</p>
<p>At that time, the revolutionary atmosphere had spread throughout the country. In Fengtian, the revolutionary hero Lan Tianwei, due to the failure of the uprising, came to Shanghai to raise military funds. He saw this news in the newspaper and hurried to the inn to visit him. They hit it off immediately. He immediately threw out thirty thousand gold to let him try to carry out great undertaking again. This kind of豪舉 to donate generously was also a masterpiece of his life. He once said that my friend, is for the country, friendship is important, the country is even more important. After the founding of the Republic of China, he was recognized by Li Yuanhong and served as brigade commander, mixed brigade commander, salt patrol commander, unified tax bureau chief, and water police chief. However, because of his upright nature, he repeatedly encountered dangers. He was once controlled by Zheng Ruicheng, and then again faced danger from Shen Hongying. Although he managed to escape from danger, his family property was destroyed from then on. In his entire life, he devoted himself to the revolutionary cause, going forward bravely, indomitable, with both spirit and perseverance worthy of admiration. In his later years, he returned to his old career and dedicated himself to the stage. It can be seen that the official career is complicated, and how can he get the freedom of an actor.</p>
