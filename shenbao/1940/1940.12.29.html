<h3>圖窮七見的軸心陣綫</h3>
<p>在此舉世承認德義軸心前途黯澹的今日，人人知道希特勒又在準備次一期的驚人行動，但恐無人敢斷言其行動之方向，他的最後一張紙牌究將如何打法，還是一個不易猜測的謎。隨件着德軍入義消息而來的，不是這些納粹部隊的實際渡海助戰，也不是柏林軍事當局的加緊攻英，而是三十萬德軍開入羅馬尼亞的傳聞：希特勒的用兵，向來詭秘，所傳不能視為意外。</p>
<p>不錯，柏林方面對於此事，已加否認，但言者鑿鑿，都道匈牙利境內，德國兵車絡繹不絕，紛紛開往羅馬尼亞的東南邊境，甚至傳說蘇聯當局也已在貝薩拉比亞區布魯特河左岸，集中大批紅軍，以事一戒備」，因此引起了種種揣測：一說德國行將不顧蘇聯的反對，悍然假道保加利亞。以進取希臘的薩洛尼加，俾一方換救義軍在阿爾巴尼亞的頹勢，一方還可自伊琴海進窺近東：另有一說，消兩德蘇之間　因多瑙河下游控制權問題，發生爭執，德軍東進。無非先發制人，以防紅軍突然佔據河口：祗要大批德軍開人羅境之說。證明屬實。上面兩種說法似乎都有可能，而且不同是第一說或第二說，均將反映德蘇兩國關係己由暫時的隱忍，逐漸走上了圖窮七見的階段。</p>
<p>自法國屈服之後，希特勒的課題，本來祗有一個：如何擊敗英國？他的拉攏日本締結二國同盟，威逼維希政府與西班牙加入戰爭，目的固然在此，卽放任墨索里尼去進攻希臘。又嘗’不在此！原來希特勒滿心希望借重日本，在遠束方面牽掣英國和英國的一死黨。美國，孰知日本在中國碰壁之後，南進南進，嚷了許久，始終還朱敢造次，這是第一件不如意事：他又希望慫恿西班牙去襲擊直布羅陀，以牽掣英國的海軍，脅迫貝當把法國艦隊和若干港口交出來，以協助對英作戰，但是前者旣不願代他人自火中取栗，後者又索性拿殖民地和海軍將士的向背，來做拒絕德國要求的擋前牌，這是第一件不如意事他不得已而期待他的歐洲盟友——墨索里尼，能在巴爾幹半島方面，替他打開一條血路，以便進窺近東和北菲，搖撼整個不列顛帝國，誰想到這步棋竟弄巧成拙，非但沒有收到牽掣英國的效益，反而助長了倫敦的「氣燄一；尤其使人難堪的。是希特勒於今年六月以後所全力以赴的，本來不過一個單純的「對英」問題，現在却平空又添了一個援義問題，這是第一件極大的不如意事！</p>
<p>希特勒不是瞎子，他在過去兩個月中，無日不親見義軍的敗退，他更不是笨伯，寗能不知現在來談援助，也嫌過遲？何况，牽一髮尼以動全身，在此黑衫軍大二特敗的今日，成為問題的，奚止，一個阿爾巴尼亞？換句話說，希特勒當前的課題，絕對不止是如何在阿爾巴尼亞一，隅，幫助墨索里尼轉敗為勝，而是如何在各方面，趕快穩定這業已動搖的「全盤局勢。」向之二惑於軸心國的威勢而慴伏的小國，旣未必長此「易與一，過去因一時利害關係而貌合神離的「友邦」。更難保不為聲勢日壯的敵方所拉去，甚至一向標榜親善合作的一盟友」，也不無中途仳離或澈底轉向的可能。</p>
<p>總之，黑衫軍被希臘戰敗之後，軸心陣綫已臨到重大危機，這是無可諱言的；希特勒的一切行動。雖時常帶一些神秘性，在以過去牛年的事實，，而論，雖非「動輒得咎」，至少是「事與願違」，今後之必須「孤注一擲」，殆已毫無疑問。不過，正在盛傳大批德軍開入羅馬尼亞的時候，素來主張親蘇的英國新任外相艾登，却特地約晤蘇聯大使邁斯，基，進行重要談話，這不知是偶然巧合呢，還是耐人尋味的外交運用。姑待事實的昭示罷。</p>
<h3>艾登與邁斯基會談　謀增進英蘇關係　對援華問題亦曾討論　樸芳稱贊華戰時經濟</h3>
<p>倫敦　新任外相艾登、昨與蘇聯大使邁斯基會談、事後兩方均稱、彼此均以極誠懇之願望、交換意見、以求增進吳·蘇兩國之友誼、外界咸認為、莫斯科當道現對於艾登之態度、已不復有前此對於哈里法克斯之猜疑心理、據聞此次會談、乃係艾登邀請邁斯基明白列出英·蘇兩國言歸於好之眼前的障礙、又兩氏亦曾討論遠東問題、對於英·蘇兩國一致深願繼續援助中國事件、頗有磋商、（二十八日合眾電）</p>

<h3>特載　美國駐日大使格魯</h3>
<p>他最後一步的升遷係在一九二七年被任爲駐土耳其大使，年俸一萬七千五百元。這個位置，頗覺安閒，他主要的工作，祇要和凱末爾聯絡。他的手段非常高超，他在全夜打撲克中，一味輸錢給他的東道主人。他又曾游泳過博斯布魯海峽，使土耳其人相顧驚訝。</p>
<p>格魯大使生在一個波士敦銀行家的舊家庭中。他排行第三，在沒有脫離育嬰房的時候，便已開始一生的事業。他的保姆管敎頗嚴，每逢他頑劣不肯聽話，便將他放在一張特製的小椅上，關照他不許下來。一天，他希望有幾個朋友來和他同玩。可是朋友未來，他已先犯了規，被保姆判坐在椅子上面。一會兒客人來了，在起居室中飲茶談話，格魯不得已，便荷着道張椅子，來到室中。能權衡文字和精神的輕重，是良大使的第一個主要條件，他已在這决表演中明白顯露出來了。</p>
<p>格魯的幼年敎育，並無什麼特殊之處，晤示他將來又是一個成功的銀行家。他初進小學讀書，幾個夏大，都消磨在孟哲斯德地方。靑年時代的格魯，逢星期日也常到海德公園鎭郊外祖老太爺的大莊園中獵取飛鳥，或是學奏鋼琴，或是收集郵票，或在家庭中參加茶會。他在格洛登讀書時候，仍不脫兒童時代的本色。他在哈佛大學中，因熱心硏究宗敎，以致無暇交際。他具有堅忍的特性，往往能發揮所長。他雖不是個有名的運動家，却曾得到一英里賽跑的錦標。他雖不是個文學家，却也曾主持過學會，擔任過編輯。</p>
<p>格魯的忠於母校，是很足使人感動的。哈佛大學舉行創立三百年紀念時，他寗可放棄一切，前往參加，擔任司賤一職。哈佛耶魯兩大學舉行賽船時，非有特別重大事故，他總要靜聽短波無綫電廣播，報吿兩校比賽的成績。大使又歡喜參加同級學友的聚餐會或俱樂部，演說時儼然有外交家自信的神情，可是在實際上終是空洞無物。</p>
<p>波士敦有錢的男子，可分兩種：一是志在經營商業，一是志在游資四方。格魯是屬於志在游歷的一派。他自畢業哈佛大學以後，便向父親進言，要週游世界歸來，再從事銀仃業務。他走馬看花般在歐洲忽忽游歷一過，便急忙趕往新加坡，和他預先的定的兩個遊伴惠勒和潘萊會面。三人連袂游歷馬來，印度，中國等地。途中遇到亞洲兩種動物，「飛象」「大蟲」，引起他投身外交界的熱心，到後來卒能如願以償。</p>
<p>「飛象」的奇遇，是在爪哇叢林中。所謂「飛欽」者，其實是一種毒蚊的外號。當時格魯和他的同伴，正在跟踪追逐虎豹熊鹿，不料螳螂捕蟬，黄雀在後，一頭「飛象」，却在暗中進隨格魯，把他可了一口，結果患着九死一生的瘧疾。四個苦力，把他放在吊床上，扛到新加坡，再送到印度北方去養病。中途到孟買，寒熱復發，病勢較前更重。美國總領事費，威廉常去看他。有一决，他在昏惘之中，把書籍，橘子，香蕉，花瓶，向來客亂擲。幸而費氏心地仁厚，毫不介意。他所談的外交職務，更是趣味盎然，從此便打動了格魯的心弦，決意要做一個外交家了。</p>
<p>這一隻毒蚊，雖引起了格魯的大志，後來却因一隻「山貓」，而使他達到目的。格魯游覽印度風景，又在巴爾的斯敦獵獲了六頭山羊，兩頭黑熊，和幾種野獸，便又動身到厦門去獵虎。一羣中國人，手執鋼又，幫着他把一隻「大蟲」趕入山洞，格魯蛇行而入，伏在地上，他的面部，離開那虎祇有四尺光景，看準要害，連發三槍，那虎掙扎一會，便直挺挺的死了。</p>
<p>格魯到波士敦家鄉，長日無聊，把旅行日記改寫成書，一面耐心等待，俟有機會，卽可投身外交界。這時羅斯福總統化在找求獵取巨獸的刺激。有一天，網球會中格魯的朋友，現任總檢察官柯萊，向羅總統提議畀格魯以外交職務。羅氏怒吼道，「我們用不着穿絲襪的波士敦人」。柯萊便把格魯的手寫稿呈與羅斯福，還加上一句評　道，「這是値得一讀的刺激性作品」。</p>
<p>羅斯福讀了格魯的著作，頗覺津津有味，當卽召他准見，經過一决談話之後，便派他做美國駐埃及開羅總領事館秘書，並目替他的，「遠東游獵記」做了一篇序文說，「你爬過狹仄的石徑，直入虎穴，在離虎不足四尺之處，將虎擊斃，這種驚人的冒險行動，爲我生平所創見，你做事旣膽識兼備，著作又有聲有色，我國外交界中得此人村，大可稱慶了</p>
<p>格魯的書齋地板上曾舖着那張虎皮，凶惡之狀，使人望而生畏，後來，格魯夫人以爲太覺可怕，方始把牠栘開。現在這張虎皮，還存放在華盛頓的冷藏室。</p>

<h3>經濟叢談</h3>
<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>紙烟（二）</p>
<p>紙烟當初只供外國人自己吸用。其時的進口稅則，凡外國人自用不以轉售於中國人的，可不納稅。遂致紙烟·雪茄·洋酒。等物，因華人與西人交結漸多，又加以洋派學時髦的心理，於是這一類消費品，逐漸傳入中國人社會中去，進口愈多，稅收損失甚大，所以光緒二十五年九月，盛宜懷條陳籌餉事宜，以此爲言，「近來外國烟·酒·藥料。器皿·等物，中國銷路甚廣，不盡各國官商自用，應分別籌議加稅。」足見這一時期中國人嗜好，逐漸歐化的了！</p>
<p>大約此時中國人一般所吸用之紙烟，爲品海（卽針頭牌Pin　Head　）牌紙烟。但最盛行的還推孔雀牌（Peacock與龍牌（Dragon）兩種烟。爲什麽這兩種紙烟爲中國人所喜吸，正爲其能投舉吸香烟之中國人的所好。蓋當時中國人對於吸紙烟尙無素習，若使不用香烟嘴（卽香烟管），那末，一枝香烟方入口，半枝香烟已爲唾沫浸濕了。孔雀牌與龍牌，每匣烟中，附有紙質塗蠟的烟嘴六七枚，每枚畏的半寸，互相套接，居然成爲一具良好的香烟嘴。但此兩種香烟不久就絕跡了。代之而起者則有强盜牌（刀牌Pirate）大英牌（亦稱粉包Ruby　Queen）這幾種烟。</p>
<p>最老的品海牌爲什麽在當初有一度不流行呢？這是受了國際政洽的影響。蓋在光緒三十一年（西曆一九〇五年）美國定了一種禁止華工苛例，其時的中國人，已是睡獅將醒，遂開始了第一次對外杯葛行動（Boy—Cott），掀動了東南數省抵制美貨，最熱心奔走的還推曾少卿先生，分赴各地演講，在頑舊嫉忌的政府下，更屬雜能可貴。因爲品海牌是美商烟公司出品，爲了避免抵制之故，遂由英商出而續辦，於是卽成爲B．A．T．（爲英美烟公司之簡稱）商標了！</p>
<p>紙烟雖是外洋輸入，但當光緒十四五年之間，上海已有洋商設廠製造。據說第一家是蘇州河畔老晋隆洋行，卽在他三層樓上製烟，惟恐爲華人偷學了去，所以是諱莫如深，謝絕參觀。</p>
<p>其時的紙烟，只賣三四十文一匣（銀圓一枚的兌九百三四十文）然而在當時的生活程度，還覺得紙烟價格太貴，所以又發行一種五支裝紙烟，如鼓牌鷄牌之類。至於最膾炙人口的上等香烟是二砲臺，三砲臺是綠色紙匣裝，吸一砲臺烟的是幾位大闊老，然亦不過一角餘一包。此時華商南洋兄弟烟草公司的出品雙喜牌，漸發現於市上了。一般吸烟的靑年，爲了他是中國人自己設廠製造的出品，所以雙喜烟一出世，銷路大盛。而且雙喜烟的包裝，頗有類於三砲臺，二十支裝雙喜烟，每包又附有竹烟嘴，更爲初吸烟者所歡迎。繼之而出者有飛艇牌，學生牌，俱爲投學生所好。從此華商紙烟廠如雨後春筍般開設，頗有壓倒洋商烟公司之勢；加以愛用國貨的潮流，又在鼓動着，而其後華商烟公司中出品，如南洋之白余龍，長城，及華成之金鼠，美麗，頗爲中上社會所愛吸。於是洋商烟公司目覩情况，至一九三五年，在上海的英美，大美，花旗三公司，合組爲頤中運銷烟公司，以與華商相競爭，到了八一三後，華商的幾家大烟廠，因爲設廠的地點關係，都受到絕大打擊，此本是一時現象，何况仍在繼續出烟，不過香烟的王座，又移轉於洋商烟廠了。</p>
<p>雪茄是著名的呂宋雪茄Cigar，不問而知爲外國貨了。中國雖亦有倣造，總不若舶來之佳。</p>
<p>中國原有生產的烟葉，絕少能供紙烟之用。是以英梟烟公司爲了求本地供給原料起見，特地在魯豫等省覓土質相宜者，散給烟植，命農家種植，再向之收買，辦理以來，頗著成效，然自華北事變之後，採辦亦多困難了。</p>
<p>紙烟所用的烟葉，以葉本之尖端最嫩。最嫩的烟葉製烟固然佳，可是味太淡了，吸烟者不毅勁。接近葉柄之大部分烟葉，父失之於太老了，只可製下等烟。於是不嫩不老恰到好處的，只有接近葉尖以下的一小部分。製烟時，將烟葉抽去烟筋烟梗，然後細切成絲，再用紙捲。抽下來的筋梗，壓扁之後，再用機切細，和於烟絲中以製烟，所以吸普涌紙烟，有時候突自烟中，迸裂出一些烟片來，卽是壓不平切不細的烟梗。那就使吸烟者感覺不快。紙烟之所以香，與有和潤的烟味，正爲其和有糖酒的絲故。然而過分多和了，那末，吸烟之際，或逢著潮濕天氣，那烟枝上一點一點黄汁斑點透露在紙上，卽不良於吸，而烟枝亦易霉化了！</p>
<p>香烟更較早烟水烟爲直刺咽喉，不言別的，單看吸紙烟的兩指，與一副牙齒，往往薰成黃黑色，那可知薰灼得利害了。至於牙痛，齦腫，咽頭與口腔發炎，那不算一回事。作者除雅片烟外，鼻烟雪茄偶亦嘗試，至於水烟，紙烟，旱烟，自信有相當經歷。允其是紙烟，具有二十七年的歷史，直到民國二十年冬天，因爲喉啞到發音無聲，經過不少醫生治療，未能奏效，有勸余戒吸紙烟者，遂於某一天晚上屛絕小吸。詰朝，友人不見余吸烟，以爲余忘帶烟，以一枝相貽，余語以故，友人笑謂余曰，一鼓作氣易，不及半年，君父將恢復舊態矣。余答以姑試之，且觀其後。如今父將第十年矣，余未嘗一吸烟，友朋中初皆不之信。其後皆知我爲眞誠，由可知戒烟非難事，所息無決心恒心耳！　（完）</p>

<p>埃及和利比亚　今古戰場的烏瞰　　　非洲北部地中海沿岸，自古卽爲羣雄爭覇之地，現在英義兩國軍隊又在該處酣戰了。　　非洲北部，地處險要，除受羅馬帝國控制外，歷來還曾受希臘，畢占與，阿刺伯和土耳其先後統治，多不得好結局　　直到五十餘年前，埃及還是內爭不已，英國的勢力開始伸入，英國向埃及王購得的蘇彝士運河權益仍常遭威脅，經英埃共同統治，力加整頓，這塊有歷史性的土地纔秩序井然，繁榮起來了。　　九一二年，義大利從土耳其奪得里比亞，至今軍隊叉在該地重演古時的衝突，祗是軍隊配備和作戰情形，古今不同而已。　　古時的羅馬，旣統治北非，便從　萊那加海岸和富庶的尼羅河流域，取得穀類的供給，且遂其控制地中海之願。　　現代的羅馬，一面在里比亞北部闢立農業殖民地，一面結集軍隊，擬破埃及，直取蘇彝士運河，且高呼地中海是一我們的海」。　　現代的埃及，較昔尤爲富庶。法國人特萊賽普曾在一片黃沙中，鑿成蘇彝士運河，是爲埃及前往東方的捷徑，舊時駱駝隊所循的陸路遂無人過問　　考埃及原是土耳其帝國的一部，一九一四年至一九二二年間則受英國保護，一九三六年，英埃簽訂條約，規定英國不復以武力佔據埃及，但埃及須承認英國有防衛蘇彝士運河與利用亞力山大里亞和賽特兩港爲海軍根據地的權利。　　筆者從班加齊港起，沿里比亞與埃及海岸，到蘇彝士運河爲止，遊歷這片古往今來的戰塲，茲略述沿途風光。　　啟程時係搭義大利民用機，飛入班加齊飛行港，縱目下矚，傳設中的「金蘋菓園」盡收眼底。移殖來此的義大利人，正在竭力發展進繁榮的「金蘋菓」園地。　　英義兩國軍隊在北非干戈相見後，班加齊已成義大利本國運輸軍隊軍需在北非登岸的重要兵站。其地土地肥渥，近年來菓園，葡萄園和麥田，擴展不已。塞萊那加沿海地帶的雨量，足够耕植所需，不必再加液溉，平均每五年亢旱一决，義大利工程帥現正開關自流井，以防天旱。　　在塞萊尼的途中，很多新關的橄欖園，靑翠欲滴。一片赤土上，長着金黄色的大麥，農民站在打穀機上眺望着，更有肥胖的農家孩子，從粉刷一新的農舍裏，向路人招手。　　十餘哩外的阿普羅尼亞，是塞萊尼的口岸，從希臘，巴力斯坦，尼羅河口各口岸和地中海各港駛出的船舶，都到該港起卸貨物。塞萊尼哲學鼻祖亞列斯蒂普斯，無神論者齊奧杜勒斯，最先決定地球子午綫長度和繪製世界地圖的地理學家伊拉都森斯和詩人加列瑪卓等古代名人，都卜居在塞萊尼　　向杜那越高原東行，沿道又有新闢農業殖民區。杜那多井，取水便利，從古便多菓園，至今還是如此。市塲上葡萄纍纍成球。鄕區產麥極多，運往蘇格蘭製麥茅，直至歐戰勃發，正常貿易纔吿中斷。　　杜那井水充足，此在義大利軍戰略上，關係重大。沿海向東的都白魯克却缺淸水，須用船從杜那運井水以維持。塞萊那加沿海產淸水地，祗杜那和班加齊而已。　　都白魯克港近來迭遭英國海空軍轟搫，故其名常見報端。這裹多的是勞工，可供義國使用。附近也有古城遺跡，大的是希臘人所建的安蒂比爾戈斯城，經過悠久的歲月，整天讓里比亞沙漠的風沙刮着，至今祇剩一片斷垣殘柱。　　都白魯克是北非海岸的良港，港內駐有義大利海陸軍。半島地東仲人海成灣，長約二哩，闊一哩弱，低論大氣如何，船隻都能駛入。　　里比亞最富僥的產物，除大麥外，首推地中海沿岸的海綿。從古以來，希臘漁夫就在這裏潛海採取杯形的海綿質地優良，每年四月到　月，西起里比亞的錫特拉灣，東止埃及的瑪特魯港，海面採綿船畢集。　　捕金鎗魚也漸成重要的實業。美國太平洋沿岸的漁商都抽盡金鎗魚的油質，裝罐出售，使其味像雞肉。義大利人却不然，完全保存着魚味。　　從都白魯克起，有支路向南穿過沙漠，到靑草叢牛的迦拉白勃，這是數年前埃及割讓義國之地。主要軍公路從都白魯克再向東仲展九十哩而達巴迪亞港和埃及邊界。　　就地圖看來，里比亞區面積廣博，較義國本部的大五倍半但適於耕植之地有限，除塞萊那加沿海的狹長地帶和特里波利太尼亞的若千區域外，其他見諸地圖的地名，祇是軍事前哨，一簇泥舍，一片草地或一處水穴而已，餘者便是茫茫無際的沙漠，沙丘起伏，亂石崎嶇。　　埃及也佔北菲洲的大塊土地，其情形正和里比亞相同。人們常說「埃及便是尼羅河，尼羅河伸是挨及」，可見該幽的肥渥地帶，祗在尼羅河流城。　　狹畏的尼羅河，穿過埃及，現在較往昔更窩腴了。過去五十年來，英國斥巨資派技師，會同埃及當局改良尼羅河水利，工程的偉大，堪與古代紀念碑媲美。　　往時埃及人賴尼羅河每年一度的泛濫，植穀以維生計，現在却不然了。河上築有堰堤水閘，控制河水，故每年榖熟可一二三次。埃及棉產常影響世界棉價。技師每年發展新計劃，逐漸在沙漠邊緣闢成農產區，但整個說來，埃及可耕植之區還是很小，祇全境二十八分之一而已。　　里比亞沙漠到尼羅河西面爲止，向東便是阿刺伯沙漠，直至蘇彝士和紅海。沙漠中祇有草地，部落人民的小舍，和駱駝隊所經之路，打破一片空曠，井旁偶有一簇泥舍，便利旅者不淺，距里比亞邊界六十哩的錫迪巴拉尼，便是這樣的地方。　　沿埃及海岸再向東行，抵瑪特魯港。該港簡直是一所防務鞏固的大軍營，英國駐紮大軍，有海道鐵路，與亞力山大里亞相聯絡。　　二千年前，埃及女王克麗奧巴屈拉曾將瑪特魯改爲避暑地，和她的寵臣安東尼在這裹眺望地中海浪湧潮漲，澎湃搫岸。現在士兵在瑪特魯海濱游泳之地，還留着「克麗奧巴屈拉女王沐浴處」的美名。　　瑪特魯常有顯要人物的足跡。紀元前三三一年，亞力山大大帝曾路過道裹，前往著名的沙漠中草地西華。那時亞力山大大帝從馬其頓率軍遠征，百戰百勝，已經過小亞細亞，在埃率斯大破波斯軍，包圍泰埃亞，歷七月而陷之，更征服巴力斯坦和埃及，建立亞力山大里亞港。　　西華在瑪特魯西南約二百哩，沿途盡是沙漠山崗，祗少許水井點綴其間。該地的神籤，在紀元前六百年，早已名聞遐邇，遠勝希臘的台爾斐神籤。在亞力山大大帝前後，也有許多帝王顯貴無法解決人事或國家大計，便到西華的朱匹特安蒙神廟求籤。這所神廟還存在着，沿路旅客，總是絡繹不絕。　　西華地勢低於海面的六十呎，盛產棗椰，石榴，檸檬，橄欖和蔬菜。每當豐收季節，駱駝隊首尾相接，都到這裹採辦甘美的鮮菓。西華週圍盡是山崗，村民多在山谷內造屋以居，餘者或在山崗中，闢石成室，或在山崗上蓋泥舍以棲，村民生活言語，不受外來影響。　　馬其頓征服埃及時，建造的亞力山大思亞港，是最能垂諸不朽的紀念物。該港沿海鬧市長十哩，商業繁盛，大厦齊整，居高下瞰，屋宇鱗次櫛比，祇公園區是一片空敝。港內船隻密集，鐵路塲中，濃烟陣陣，高升消散。　　亞力山大里亞沿海有斐洛燈塔（古代七奇之一）矗立着，現在沿海一帶，却滿佈着探照燈，入夜燈火横掃天空，搜査敵　蹤跡。四白多年前，葡萄牙航海家達加瑪等人發現繞好望角赴印度的海路後，亞力山大里亞的貿易一落千丈，直到蘇彝士運河闢成，埃及棉花發達，才使這城的商業，再轉繁榮。　　向東不遠，便是尼羅河左支流河口的洛賽泰村，以產石和瓜聞名。在去洛塞泰的半途，經過沿海的阿勃圭爾，該地海上漁夫听用的網，長達哩許。百餘年前，法王拿破崙曾率艦兵船十七艘准侵，鎭守尼羅河的英將納爾遜派兵船迎戰，在阿勃圭國外海中大戰，搫毀拿破崙的兵船十三艘，一戰破之。　　若從亞力山大里尼搭埃及航空公司飛機飛往賽特港和開羅，便可飽覽尼　河口富庶區的全景，祗見河畔農塲處處，河盡處是沙漢起點。開羅北十五哩尼羅河分流處的水堰是一八三三年間拆下基柴金字塔的石塊造成的，工程浩大，當時因耗費過巨，未曾完工，直到一八九一年纔經英技師擘劃，完全造竣。　　乘飛機向開羅南飛途中，俯矚地面，滿目是無數圓形物，辨認不淸。降陸後纔知道是沿用老法的打榖塲。　　旅客所想像中的開羅，乃是個古風盈然的大城，却不料現代屋宇林立，汽車街車，往來不絕，少婦不籠面巾，街頭小販叫賣冰結漣，一切都是現代城市的景象。假如折入阿刺伯區，當然還可見到狹猛的街道，古舊的房屋堡壘，土人的市集，商人在駱駝羣中，悠着談着小賣買，幾乎令人混忘生活在二十世紀。　　出開羅有大道直達尼羅河彼岸的基柴。那裏有著名的人面獅身像和金字塔，沿途却是新式的住宅區。入夜，旅館和總會裏，高奏蚊新的流行歌曲，埃及靑年男女，婆娑起舞。開羅博物院爲防空襲起見，已將買貴物品和埃及前王的遺體，運回墓地，以策安全。　　沿尼羅河上行，到處可見金字塔，古廟，和古城的遺蹟。朋尼哈桑地方的石墓上，還鐫着古代埃及人的生活畫，如行獵，舞蹈，摔角，耕植，甚至賭博，色色俱全。沿河更向南行，多處水閘早已落成，新閘還在建造，兩旁運河，不斷放闊，灌漑棉花和甘蔗田。現在的埃及，在英埃兩國實業的發展之下，已有長足的進步。　　若從間羅來飛機前往賽特港，途中飛過古域泰尼斯。本年二月間，埃及學家法國人蒙德曾亦這城發現第二十一朝第二代蘇賽納斯王之墓，內藏金銀珠寳極多。　　賽特港在蘇彝士運河口，沿海堤岸上立着費舉生心血，闢成這運河的法國技帥特萊賽普紀念像，一手直指運河。像某鐫着「打開世界任衆通行」八字。　　蘇彝士運河長百哩，穿過沙漠，蒂姆薩湖，和苦湖，而到蘇彝士入紅海，實爲歐洲通達束非，印度，和遠東各口岸的捷徑，逐漸疏濬，河床日深，河岸也愈放愈阔，以便巨船通航，至今除最大的船隻外，都能暢通。平常每年駛過此河的船舶的六千艘。此河，可說是不列顚帝國的生命綫了。</p>

<p>兒童周刋孔子的二塊寶石  張一雷　　　—忠和恕—　　童年時在私塾裏讀書，每當上學放學的時候，老師就要我們向壁上掛着的一個白鬚老者的肖像，行鞠躬禮，我們不懂所以要鞠躬的道理，老師就解釋，說他叫孔夫子，是個大聖人，我們應該恭敬他，……接着還講了很多關於孔夫子的故事，但總因那時候我們程度幼稚，聽了還是莫名其妙，不過老師的話總要遵守的，於是我們天天在上學放學的當兒，也就莫名其妙地朝着肖像行鞠躬禮了。　　直到我快要高小畢業，這中間經過很多老師的啟示，才漸漸有些瞭解了這位孔聖人，才知道他的品行旣好，學問父博，生活也過的非常樸素，待人接物更是慈祥可親，並且對學生們又常常講「忠」（就是盡心盡力做事）與「恕」（就是處處體諒人家）的道理。　　現在，我已經是個大孩子了，我的知識自然又要比先前提高不少，加之思想上受着「時代之浪」的冲搫，我又漸漸領悟到，我們對孔子的操行與學識，現在應該替他作一種「新」的解釋，大家不光要把孔子的良好的道德行爲，配合了時代精神去努力學取他，使自己鍛鍊成一個健全的模範的國民，同時還要把他「忠」與「恕」的道理發揚光大起來，比如孔子說的「忠」，是叫人盡心盡力做事，我們就要把他擴大爲盡心盡力爲國家社會效忠，至於「恕」，對於勇於改過的人，自然應該寬恕他，並且還要爭取他，爭取他做一個有爲的人，但對於一般已經失去了靈魂的人，非但不能寬恕他，並且還要打搫他，撲滅他，直把他撲滅到「根除」爲止，祗有這樣，我們才是眞正地瞭解了孔子的「忠」與「恕」的道理。冬天寒冷的緣故  金箴　　　近幾天來的風，打從西北面刮來，使人寒噤，似乎剌骨一般的可怕，尤其是在早晚的當兒。　　「這幾天的氣候，怎麼又比前幾天冷得多了？」阿慧剛從溫暖的被窩裹爬起來時，便這樣的同着止在洗臉的阿明。　　「這因爲冬大到了，氣候當然是變成很冷的了。」「那麽爲什麽到了冬天要寒冷起來呢？」阿慧同個不休。　　一天氣的冷熱，和太陽光與風的方向，最有關係。冬季的太陽偏在南方，而我國是在地球的北部，因此所受的太陽光，當然比了夏天耍弱得多，而且白天的時間很短，夜裏的時問長，於是地面上所受太陽的光熱不多，天氣就冷了。並且冬季的風多從西北方吹來，可是西北方的氣候，比了我們這裏更來得冷，所以那邊吹來的風，也是很冷的，於是這裏的天氣也就冷了起來。」　　「冬季的太陽爲什麽偏在南方，哥哥，你可能吿訴我嗎？」　　「好，做個實騐給你看，你便可明瞭了。」阿明脫完了這話，便去找到了。隻皮球，一枝蠟燭，和一枝粉筆，先在皮球中央書上了一條白線，作爲地球的赤道。然後他拖了阿慧到一間粉黑暗的房裏更把窗簾布拉沒了，房裹更黑暗得多。他在一張桌子上，劃成一個橢圓形，又在橢圓的中心放着一枝蠟燭，點上了火，把燭光當做太陽光；然後把皮球放在白線上，務須使燭光能照在皮球上，而皮球一面更在白線上移動。阿明便開口說道：「皮球本禮的轉動叫做地球的自轉，自轉一次，便是一日；皮球沿着白線的移動，便是地球的公轉，公轉一圍，要三百六十五日。」他使皮球上白線不和桌上的白線互相平行，這因為地球的軸是傾斜的。先使燭光射在赤道上（皮球中央的白線於是把皮球不住轉動，只見燭光漸漸地向赤道南面移動，和北溫帶更遠，並且北半球上暗的地方更多，明的地方逐漸减少。阿明便又說道：「這是在冬季的時候，太陽光照射在南方，而北方照着的部分少，因此北方便是在冬季，感覺得氣候很冷，並且陽光照射的時間也短，於是冬季是日短夜長，冬至日是一年中日照時間最短的一天。你明白了嗎？」　　「那我明白了。我還要問你：冬季爲什麼多北風和西北風？」　　「這因爲我們這裏的溫度本很高，空氣便桶薄於空氣上昇，北方濃厚的冷空氣，流來補足它，所以冬季多西北風。」追記一個值得紀念的聖誕節  宛文　　　村前的老虎山，被雙幻的雲海遮蔽着，忽現忽隱，青葱的松林，愈來愈糢糊了。天氣突然寒冷起來，濛濛的細雨開始下着，直到傍晚，片片雪花已到處　揚。在山谷下小村上一所瓦屋裏，站着一羣逃亡的孩子，他們面對着老虎山，默默地看着偌大的雪花，不發一語，往日的喜悅與興奮消失了。在每人的小心靈中，正在回憶着故鄉下雪的一幕。他們想着下雪的景象又是快樂聖誕節　臨的預兆，這裏雖沒有一份日曆可以査考，不過像這樣的氣候，這樣的氣象，似乎聖誕節已經在眼前了。在劍靑父親的日記簿上，果然寫着今天是十二月二十四日，這日子在他們想來，又覺得來得太忽促，也太不合時了。他們常聽得父母說。。「逃難出來，已有一年四個月了一。屈指算來，住戶這離故鄉一千多里的古黟，也有三個月，爲什麼還不能回去呢？爲什麽聖誕節不能等待我們回去慶祝呢？現在一切都空虛，明天就是聖誕節，可是光燦　目的聖誕樹呢？和藹慈祥的聖誕老人呢？還有美麗的卡片，美味的糖果，有趣的玩具呢？一切的一切都消失了。他們不能再想下去，垂頭喪氣的踏着雪回到自已的寓所。劍靑吃了晚飯，很早的就睡覺，一會兒，他入了甜蜜的夢鄕，夢見自己穿了新衣服，在一盛大的慶祝會中，和朋友們玩着吃着唱着：又夢見聖誕老公公坐了雪撬，從很遠的地方來，把許多糖果玩具卡片塞滿他掛着的襪子裏，他高興的跳躍着，歡呼着，突然被强烈的光照醒了。什麽都沒有，房中仍是幾隻床，孤獨的站在那裏，弟妹們早已起身，在外面玩雪。他不免失望起來，可是在他整理床舖時，發現紅紙包的禮物，上面寫着：「劍靑吾兒」，他看淸了筆跡，知道是母親送的禮物，於是卽忙扯去外面的包皮紙，裏面是本名人故事集，在書的第一頁，寫着許多字：「我親愛的孩子，在你接到這本書時，我知道你是如何的失望，可是我們在這惡劣的環境中，仍有房子住，仍有衣服穿，仍有三餐吃，而且這村上的隣人，很誠心的幫助我們，使我們在三月中，過着很平安的生活，你要知道有許多同胞，他們顚沛流離，沒有吃，沒有穿，需要他人救濟，更有許多將士，不顧自己的性命，爲我們爭取公義正理，受了傷，不能立刻醫治，肚子餓了，不能立刻得到食物，他們需要人們精神上物質上的安慰，所以我把聖誕節的費用，一部分捐給村上的長老，作爲過路傷兵膳食費用，一部分買些糖果，分給本村上窮苦兒童，使每人因我而得到快活，才是我眞正的快活，也是你眞正的快活。希望你依着偉人的足跡前行，犧牲自己，使人得到恩惠，這才是紀念聖誕　　節的眞諦，這才是我所悅納的孩子。」劍靑看完後，被他母親的話感動得流淚，覺得自己太自私，太偏狹了。於是在謝過母親後，偷偷的把逃難時留在身邊的一張五元鈔票，獨自踏着很厚的雪，到村上長老家去，說明來意，長老感激的收受了。在他的歸途中，心中滿溢着喜樂，母親的話，在他腦中蕩漾着：「他人因我而得到快活，才是我眞正的快活。」這時他才體昧到意思的深長。他正在且想且走時，他的同伴在很遠的地方招呼他：「劍靑，你到那裏去了，把我尋得好苦啊！張伯伯要我們去幫忙呢，下午要舉行聖誕會了，你還不快走。」「眞的嗎？在什麽地方開會呢？」「等一會吿訴你，他們已等了好久，我們快些走吧！」他們奔到了張伯伯家裏，果然有許多同鄕的小朋友已在練唱聖誕歌，成人們有的把報紙做袋子，有的在分派糖果，有的在佈置，大家都在忙碌的預備慶祝，劍靑就加入唱歌隊裹，並且張伯伯又請他講聖誕故事，他立刻答應了。這樣他上午很忙的工作了半天，心中却不再覺得空虛，因爲他時常想起了母親的話。下午他早已在村上的一所小學裏，幫着裝飾會堂，村上人扶老携幼，很早的等在那裏，發出好奇的眼光，因爲聖誕節在他們村上，還是第一次呢。在開會時間，會堂的座位已不够分配，遲到的只得站着，門內外都擁擠着村民，會堂的佈置，表演的節目，在劍靑的給騐中，是簡單的，可是在村民的眼中都覺得有趣新奇，他們笑着講着說：「這些異鄉人的玩意兒，正不錯呢。」最後他們每人拿了一包包的糖果，很滿意的回家去。劍靑雖亦分到一包，可是他送給了對門時常被主人敲打的小丫頭，伊表示無限的快活和感激，把它寳貴的藏起來。劍靑回到家裏，已是夕陽西下的時候，身子很是疲勞，但是他心中的煩悶，好似弟妹們淸晨堆的雪人，融化得只剩些水了。他呆望着白茫茫的老虎山，陶醉在廣闊的宇宙間，默念着：「他人因我而得到快活，才是我眞正的快活。」小典故  次愷　　「管窺」是所見不多的意思，就是說和眼睛帶着管子看東西一樣，看不見東西的全部，只看見極小的一部分。客氣地稱自己的意見叫「管見」，也就說自己的意見淺薄得像管中看見的一樣小。也有人用「井蛙之見」四個字看了一部的東西有時可以推到全部，這種情形我們便用一斑兩個字，好像帶着管子看豹，所看見的一個斑點似的。有時可用「一　；」　是肉塊，好像鑊子裏有肉，嘗了一塊就可以曉得全鑊的味道。</p>

<p>逰藝界歐戰給予好萊塢的影響  新影　　一年將過去了，在這歲暮的時節，好萊塢照例又發生了種種特殊的新聞。這裹就筆者所知道的，湊集幾則，寫在下面：　　重訂合同　　　一般的明星，和影片公司都訂有拍戲的合同。關於工作時間，薪金待遇，都詳細的在合同上規定的。這種合同，滿期的時節雖並不一律，而內中有一部分就在這年底滿的。所以在歲暮時節，那些明星又在忙着合同問題了。有的和公司續訂，有的轉換公司，也有改藉他業，不再拍戲的。總之，每經一次歲暮，好萊塢的影星，一定有一次變動的。像保羅茂尼，他和華納所訂的合同，到年底是滿期了，是吾續訂人們還沒有知道確實的消息，便是一例。　　節省開支　　歐戰已一年多了，歐洲是美片的大好市塲，戰事的爆發，當然使好萊塢的電影業，遭遇到莫大的影饗。這影響開初倒還不覺得很重，最边已非常節省了。因此，各公司便感到憂慮，而目前正計劃節省所有影片公司方面的開支，俾。度過這難關·入手的方法，先行减除不必要的所支，像影迷寫到影片公出的信，貢獻意見，過去公司方面都設有專門部分，派人處理這些信件。但一九四一年起，這種機關爲節省開支起見，都將預備取消。尤其是二十世福斯和派拉蒙兩公司，已宣佈將把這部分取消了。　　裁員減薪　　爲了美片的海外市塲縮小，一般的影片公司，自年底起，也不得不改變營業方針，同時實行裁員减薪。不過所裁去的大半是决要的明星，而大明星的爲公司所倚爲台柱者，還是不裁。所謂减薪，當然也是如此。他如製片方面，今後成本過於鉅大的影片，也將停止拍攝，主要的原因，就在歐洲的市塲旣喪失了，成本過鉅的片子，拍攝成立後，所得不償所失，免得傳公司蝕本呢。梨園軼事　譚鑫培與南陽闗  李雲影　　　　「南陽關」這齣戲，往昔扮演者均係二路老生，以陳福勝（卽現在名旦陳麗芳的父親，名小牛陳盛泰的祖父）演的得心應手。名伶多不願扮演，時至今日，不料尸成譚派流行戲矣，如老譚故婿王又宸及其孫（富英）每唱雙齣，莫不貼此。記得前、和名凈侯喜瑞在平晤面時，曾暢談譚鑫培當年演「南陽關」的經過很詳。當譚進同慶班的時候，該班在糧食店出演。戲院是中和園，現已改名中和大戲院。）有天王瑤卿，金秀山（卽少山之父）王長林等配角因日塲老譚進院過遲，乃在前塲演畢均先後離院，待譚進院，爲時已在六時左右，彼時因無電燈，乃在台上以火炬照亮，但結果以配角乏人，是日祇好以「南陽關」塡塞。適班底中何有在金林，李壽山未走，故向管事馮金壽馮薏林商妥，請在飾韓擒虎，李演宇文成都，並派李大黑的酒保。老譚已多年未唱是劇，誰知這樣一來，竟爲歡衆大加贊賞。嗣後又在文明園煩演一次，更乃大紅特紅，聆曲者咸以斯劇爲飽耳福之佳作。「孔夫子」喬遷之喜　接「西廂記」上演於「金都」　　民華影業公司敬謹攝製費時年餘的「孔夫子」，自在金城公映以來，賣座之盛，遠出一般人意料之外，在此盛况中，無論是民傘或金城，都極願意把「孔夫子」在余城繼續公映下去，不過金城的新年映期，遠「孔夫子」還未公映之前，早已和金星訂了合同了，若依舊讓「孔夫子」在新年中公映，那對金星是很說不過去，而若把「孔夫子」就此停映，於情於理，也屬不合，好在命城與民華在此决合作中，彼此感情頗爲融洽，金城在這左右爲難中也總於想出了一個兩全其美的辦法來，辦法如何？即「孔夫子」喬遷到金都去公映是也。金都是最近才開幕的新戲院，矞皇富麗，設備等等，較金城更高一等，現在正在公映「西廂記」中，而侍「西廂記」映期滿後，「孔夫子」就立卽緊接着作第二决隆重公映，以補回隅觀衆的喁喁之望。而「孔夫子」在金城的第一次公映，則決定到除夕晚塲暫吿休映。　　（編者按：據最後消息，「孔夫子」在金都上映之日的在與本報合作之「孔夫子」徵文結束之時。）章臺柳  頋明道　　　只聽西邊樹下吱的一聲叫，二人回頭一看，原來是自己家中養着的一頭狸奴，正蹲在那邊捕鳥，湊巧有一小麻雀飛下地來覓食，他撲上去抓住了，就望口裏送，這樣那小麻雀慘叫一聲，小小生命就斷送在兇殘者的口裏了。錢牧齋心裹父是一動。如是在旁說道：「相公，我們今日爲國殉身，他時名垂竹帛，自有其不朽者在，請相公安心下池，妾當相從。牧齋又一握如是的柔荑，顫着聲音說道：「我今與卿同歸地下了。願泉台之樂，無異於生。」說罷，遂一手摳衣，走下池去。柳如是此時含着一包眼淚，緊視着牧齋，但見牧齋左脚踏入水中，速忙縮了起來，口中喊着一聲「啊喲」。柳如是忙上前問道：「相公爲何驚呼？難道還有什麽事情放不下嗎？」牧齋搖搖頭道：「不是的。我覺這池水太塞，冷入骨髓，使人當不起。」柳如是一聽這話，也不出喊聲「啊喲，相公旣拚一死，還怕什麽寒不寒？）且風日晴和，春江水暖，池水何至一寒如此？相公，你究竟耍不要殉國？」如是說着道話，玉顏上父罩着一重嚴霜。牧齋默然不答，立在池石，低倒了頭。一陣風來，把他頭上戴的朝冠吹落池中。牧齋囁嚅而言道：「我不想效三閭大夫，却想做夏遺臣靡。今天不必死，請俟異日。」如是聽牧齋如此說，伊完全絕望了，回身一走。牧齋也就一步步走上來，如戰敗公雞一般，秃蒲頭髮，走回樓上去，一隻脚却濕淋淋的都是水了。家人在旁瞧着，都不明白這是什麼一回事，但瞧見了綫牧齋這般狼狽形狀，都在背後竊笑。牧齋步進房中，氣喘吁吁的便望椅子裏一坐，鞋襪下裳雖都濕了也不知。如是坐在妝台邊，桃靨氣得發靑，指着牧齋說道：「我不該說你是個銀樣蠟槍頭！怎麼鬧了三天的死，臨到未了，却叉死不成。你前日說的話，是否由衷？可是哄騙三歲小孩子嗎？你爲什麽不死？這樣大的年紀，還有所　惜嗎？一（二四）「保聯」公演為沉淵　　　　上海市保險業餘聯誼會之「保聯劇團」，爲紀念該會已故顧問胡詠騏先生，定二十九日晨九時半在璇宮上演林柯之三幕悲劇「沉淵」，由夏風導演，票價爲二元，一元，五角，售款充胡詠騏先生保險文化基本　　景天票房定於一月三日假座湖社舉行第十五决彩排，日塲劇目爲捉放曹，獨木關，女起解及名票訾瑞霖周翕園君等之全部龍鳳呈祥。夜塲爲借東風，駡殿，落馬湖，梅龍鎭探母回令，搭配齊整，精彩定可預卜。　　光華劇社定於民國三十年一月五日上午假辣斐公演「彌撒曲「未婚夫妻」「離婚」。</p>

<h3>The Axis Line's Hidden Intentions Revealed</h3>
<p>Today, as the world acknowledges the bleak future of the German-Italian Axis, everyone knows that Hitler is preparing for another surprising move. However, few dare to predict the direction of his actions. How he will play his last card remains a difficult mystery to guess. Accompanying the news of German troops entering Italy are rumors not of these Nazi troops actually crossing the sea to assist in the war effort, nor of Berlin's military authorities intensifying their attacks on Britain, but rather of 300,000 German troops entering Romania. Hitler's military tactics have always been deceptive, and these rumors should not be considered unexpected.</p>
<p>Admittedly, Berlin has denied this, but those who speak of it are adamant, saying that German military vehicles are constantly passing through Hungary, heading towards Romania's southeastern border. There are even rumors that Soviet authorities have concentrated a large number of Red Army troops on the left bank of the Prut River in Bessarabia as a precaution," which has led to various speculations. One theory is that Germany will disregard Soviet opposition and boldly pass through Bulgaria to seize Thessaloniki in Greece, both to salvage the Italian army's declining fortunes in Albania and to gain access to the Near East from the Aegean Sea. Another theory is that disputes have arisen between Germany and the Soviet Union over control of the lower Danube River, and the German advance is a preemptive move to prevent the Red Army from suddenly occupying the river mouth. As long as the rumor of a large number of German troops entering Romania proves true, both of the above theories seem possible. Regardless of whether it is the first or second theory, both will reflect that the relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union has gradually moved from temporary tolerance to a stage where hidden intentions are revealed.</p>
<p>Since France's surrender, Hitler has essentially had only one problem: how to defeat Britain? His efforts to rope in Japan to conclude a bilateral alliance, to coerce the Vichy government and Spain to join the war, were naturally aimed at this, and even allowing Mussolini to attack Greece was intended for the same purpose! Hitler fully hoped to rely on Japan to distract Britain and its staunch ally, the United States, in the Far East. However, after Japan ran into difficulties in China, its talk of advancing south went on for a long time, yet it still did not dare to act rashly. This was the first disappointment. He also hoped to encourage Spain to attack Gibraltar to distract the British navy and to coerce Pétain to hand over the French fleet and some ports to assist in the war against Britain. However, the former was unwilling to pull chestnuts out of the fire for others, and the latter simply used the support of the colonies and naval officers and soldiers as a pretext to reject Germany's demands. This was the second disappointment. He was forced to expect his European ally, Mussolini, to open a bloody path for him in the Balkans in order to gain access to the Near East and North Africa and shake the entire British Empire. Who would have thought that this move would backfire, not only failing to distract Britain but instead boosting London's "arrogance"? What is particularly embarrassing is that what Hitler has been fully committed to since June of this year was originally just a simple "anti-British" problem, but now he has suddenly added a problem of aiding Italy. This is the third great disappointment!</p>
<p>Hitler is not blind; he has personally witnessed the Italian army's retreat in the past two months. Nor is he a fool; how could he not know that it is too late to talk about assistance now? Moreover, pulling one hair can affect the whole body. Today, with the Blackshirts suffering a major defeat, what is at stake is more than just Albania. In other words, Hitler's current problem is definitely not just how to help Mussolini turn defeat into victory in one corner of Albania, but rather how to quickly stabilize the already wavering "overall situation" in all aspects. Small countries that were previously intimidated by the Axis powers may not remain "easy to deal with" for long. "Friendly nations" that have been outwardly cooperative but inwardly divided due to temporary interests are even more likely to be lured away by the increasingly powerful enemy. Even an "ally" that has always touted its friendly cooperation may abandon the cause or completely change course midway.</p>
<p>In short, after the Blackshirts were defeated by Greece, the Axis line has reached a major crisis, which cannot be denied. All of Hitler's actions often carry some mystery, but based on the facts of the past few years, even if they are not "always wrong," they are at least "contrary to expectations." From now on, it is almost certain that he must "risk everything on a single throw." However, at a time when it is widely rumored that a large number of German troops are entering Romania, the new British Foreign Secretary Eden, who has always advocated pro-Soviet policies, specifically met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky for important talks. It is unknown whether this is a coincidence or a thought-provoking diplomatic move. Let us wait for the facts to reveal the truth.</p>
<h3>Eden and Maisky Meet to Promote Anglo-Soviet Relations; Support for China Also Discussed; Brooke-Popham Praises China's Wartime Economy</h3>
<p>London, The new Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday. Afterward, both sides stated that they had exchanged views with the utmost sincerity to seek to enhance the friendship between Britain and the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that the Moscow authorities no longer have the suspicions about Eden that they previously had about Halifax. It is reported that the meeting was Eden's invitation to Maisky to clearly list the immediate obstacles to reconciliation between Britain and the Soviet Union. The two also discussed the Far East issue and had considerable consultations on the common desire of Britain and the Soviet Union to continue to assist China. (28th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, The new Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Far East, Brooke-Popham, told reporters today that the idea that Hong Kong could be captured in a matter of days or weeks is completely wrong. It should be known that Hong Kong is a highly valuable place for the British Empire, and its defense has its own responsibilities to fulfill in the world war. Brooke-Popham spoke of China's war of resistance, saying that the Chinese people were able to open up new industrial areas even after retreating hundreds of miles, which is greatly admirable. From the perspective of the wartime economy, the small industries in the interior can be called an extremely surprising phenomenon. (28th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Rumor That Japan Will Occupy Saigon; Thai Aircraft Attack Vietnam Again; French Aircraft Distribute Leaflets Over Thailand</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, A Chinese who recently returned here from Hanoi said that the Japanese army will soon invade Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay (transliteration), 270 miles northeast of Saigon. If this is done, the "southern advance" that Tokyo claims is a matter of life and death for Japan will have completed one-third of its goal. If Japan occupies these two places, it can use them as a starting point to attack the Philippines, Malaya, and the Dutch East Indies. When Japanese troops entered Haiphong and Hanoi at the beginning of October, the Franco-Japanese agreement only allowed Japanese troops to be stationed in the Tonkin region of northern Vietnam, on the grounds that the Japanese army would advance from there to Yunnan Province in China. However, in the past two months, the Japanese troops in Hanoi have shown no signs of attacking southern China, only sending out mother planes to scatter bombs over Yunnan and the Burma Road. The Chinese who returned from Hanoi also said that the Japanese army will occupy Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay not by force, but by concluding an agreement with Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux. Decoux's subordinates, since the departure of the pro-Pétain Hertugol, are now all loyal to the Vichy government. According to military observers here, Japan believes that seizing the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, or the Philippines at this time is too dangerous, as the combined naval power of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands in the Far East cannot be underestimated. By strengthening its position in Vietnam, Japan is, in any case, getting closer to its goal of advancing south. It is generally speculated that if Britain is defeated in Europe or the United States declares war on Germany, Japan will launch an offensive. Observers believe that if the Japanese navy and army extend to Saigon and Cam Ranh Bay, the Philippines, Malaya, Borneo, and the Dutch East Indies will all feel threatened.

The delegation's four days in Yunnan left a very positive impression. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – At a banquet held on the afternoon of the 28th to welcome the Burmese journalist delegation, Shi Jie from a department of the Central Propaganda Department delivered a speech. He first expressed his welcome, then stated that travel during this wartime period in China is quite inconvenient, and that he fears a lack of adequate hospitality to the distinguished guests. However, the delegation's visit to China has a solemn and valuable purpose beyond sightseeing. He hoped that the delegation would gain substantial insights. He added that the delegation aims to study the spirit and morale of the Chinese people, and that visiting China today will allow them to understand the Chinese people more deeply than at any other time. Wherever the delegation goes, they will not only receive official hospitality but also a warm welcome from the general public. We welcome your country for two reasons: Firstly, the Chinese people deeply appreciate the sympathy of the Burmese people towards China, which relies on your guidance and the power of public opinion. Secondly, we recognize the importance of friendship and mutual respect among the various Asian nations, especially between China and Burma, which share a border of one thousand kilometers. Moreover, friendship forged in times of adversity is even more precious. U Ba Gyi, the leader of the Burmese journalist delegation, in his reply, thanked them and stated that the delegation's visit to China is neither for political nor economic/financial purposes. The sole purpose is to understand the spirit of the Chinese people during wartime. Through the introduction of the delegation members, the Burmese people will also gain understanding. (28th dispatch) Chongqing – A delegation of eight Burmese journalists arrived here this morning by plane from Kunming. Propaganda Minister Wang Shijie hosted a luncheon to welcome them, and invited many Chinese and foreign reporters to accompany them.

You will receive a warm welcome from the Chinese government and people. It is hoped that the results of this trip will further consolidate Sino-Burmese friendship. China is willing to maintain friendly relations with the people of East Asia, especially with those who share a common border with China." U Ba Galei, the leader of the Burmese journalist delegation, rose to thank him, saying that the delegation has no political or economic mission. This visit to China is solely to personally observe the situation here and collect materials for publishing lengthy articles about China in Burmese newspapers.

<h3>Japanese Economic Situation Extremely Fragile; New System Provokes Resentment; War Expenditure Unsustainable</h3>
<p>Moscow – The Soviet newspaper "Labor" published a special article discussing the opening of the 76th Japanese Diet. The author first described the extreme tension in Japan's domestic political situation and the general public's dissatisfaction with the government over the war against China. According to the article, the significant difficulties Japan is encountering in its domestic and foreign policies have intensified conflicts among the major factions of the ruling class. The Japanese business community is extremely dissatisfied with the huge budget. The New Economic System bill has also caused great resentment. Japan's agricultural situation has deteriorated during the war, and the people's food problem is extremely serious. Various industries outside of military affairs are also gradually decreasing, foreign trade is becoming increasingly difficult, and war expenditure cannot be sustained. Under the pressure of numerous military forces, Japan's economic situation is more fragile than at any other time. Although the government is using various methods to control the people's political activities, the result is to arouse the people's suspicion. Even political figures are harboring worries. This is the main reason why the New Economic System has caused criticism from all walks of life. (7th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Germany Actively Engages in Military Preparations; Attempts to Reverse the Mediterranean Crisis; Nazi Troops Concentrated on the Border of Western Countries; Uninterrupted Transport of Romanian Troops Through Hungary</h3>
<p>New York – U.S. military critic Major Eliot stated that Germany is preparing for a final attack on Britain and is now engaged in stockpiling various supplies. It plans to use all of its naval vessels to attack British sea lanes, regardless of losses, and simultaneously conduct large-scale bombings of British ports and industrial areas. If successful, it will invade Britain from both the sky and the sea. Britain is aware of this plan and is therefore paying extra attention to national defense and launching a counteroffensive in the Mediterranean, because the Mediterranean is extremely important, and Hitler cannot stand idly by. Hitler may solve the Mediterranean problem by invading Spain. Therefore, twelve German divisions have been concentrated on the Spanish border. However, Spain is currently experiencing famine. If Britain provides food and weapons, the Spanish people may be able to deter the German invasion. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Breaking the Three-Day Truce, London Suffers Another Fierce Air Raid; German Aircraft Bomb for Four Hours, Causing Fires; British Air Force Flies to Germany and Italy for Retaliatory Bombing</h3>
<p>London – Hitler's air fleet attacked London again with all its strength last night for four hours. Fires broke out in dozens of places in the city. After these hours of violence, the activity suddenly ceased. Last night's attack was equal in intensity to the most brutal bombings in the past, so some people believe that German Air Minister Göring is once again testing his new tactics. Some people believe that the Germans are trying to make short attacks with all their strength first, but the reason for not continuing the attacks after the initial attack is not very clear. Another group believes that the reason why German aircraft did not continue their fierce attacks last night was because of bad weather conditions at the German base, which prevented them from coming again. However, during these four hours of air raids, the area where German aircraft dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs was very large. The air raid alarm was sounded in London at 7 PM last night, which was the first alarm sounded in the British capital during the 103rd period of silence. The informal Christmas truce was thus broken. The News Federation claimed that all the brutal actions taken by German aircraft since the attack on Britain were fully presented in last night's air raid. Despite the bomb explosions and the fierce anti-aircraft fire, London citizens remained as usual. Public buses and electric troops on major traffic roads were still running smoothly. After an hour and a half of silence, the alarm was lifted. Last night, German aircraft seemed to be invading London one after another. (28th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London – An Air Ministry communique stated that many German aircraft bombed London last night for several hours. Some bombs also fell in East Anglia and southwestern England, killing and injuring some residents and destroying many houses. There were some fires, but they were quickly extinguished. The air raid on London was quite fierce, but the lives of residents continued as usual. Buses and trains did not stop running, and the main avenues were never completely closed to pedestrians. The all-clear was issued in the London area earlier than at noon. According to reports, a church in London was completely destroyed by an incendiary bomb, and a heavy bomb hit a hotel, causing it to collapse completely. Several nearby houses were also destroyed. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry announced that British aircraft bombed German docks, airfields, and submarine bases in French-occupied areas last night. Bordeaux, Lorient, and Le Havre were among them. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – In the week ending at dawn on December 27, the British Air Force continued to conduct extensive and fierce bombings of Germany and occupied areas, but stopped operations on the 24th and 25th. When British aircraft raided Berlin, they bombed an aircraft engine factory, many other factories, a railway station, a freight yard, anti-aircraft positions, searchlight outposts, and a port in the west. Some British aircraft descended to a height of one hundred feet to ensure accurate bombing. The docks and oil factories in Porto Maghera near Venice, Italy, were bombed by British aircraft for the first time. The British aircraft participating traveled a total of over 1,600 miles round trip. Industrial and railway targets in Mannheim were bombed on two nights. British aircraft dropped thousands of incendiary bombs and heavy bombs. A fire and huge explosion were caused by bombing Ludwigshafen. The Oslo-Bergen railway, which was used by the German military for transportation and supply, was also hit in several places by British aircraft. Ships and airfields in Dunkirk were bombed four times, and docks and harbor works in Flushing were attacked three times. Only four British aircraft did not return to base in all of the above air raids. (28th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Danube River Navigation Issues; Germany and Soviet Union's Opinions Difficult to Reconcile</h3>
<p>Rome – The countries involved in the Danube River navigation issue held a conference here in September of this year to discuss it, which was adjourned until the beginning of this month and will reconvene in January of next year. There is no definite information to confirm the details of the discussions. According to reliable sources, since Romania ceded the Bessarabia region to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has become one of the countries along the Danube River and has a direct interest in the navigation issue of the river. Therefore, it advocates the establishment of two permanent organizations to be responsible for handling various issues related to navigation: one to manage the upper reaches of the Danube River, from the source to Graz City in Romania, which is the navigation of the river where it meets the Prut River; and the other to manage the lower reaches of the Danube River to the Black Sea. According to the Soviet Union, the only countries along the lower Danube River are the Soviet Union and Romania, which indicates that it intends to gain a major position in the latter organization, thereby controlling the mouth of the Danube River. If this is achieved, it will have great significance both politically and economically, because controlling the shipping at the mouth of the river is equivalent to controlling most of the shipping. The German government, on the other hand, insists that all issues related to the Danube River should be resolved by a single organization. It is difficult to reconcile the views of both sides for the time being. The Danube River International Conference was formed in 1856 in accordance with the Treaty of Paris. This treaty stipulates that the major European powers should be responsible for carrying out various necessary projects to ensure that the mouth of the Danube River is navigable. After World War I, this international conference was reorganized and composed of countries along the Danube River together with Britain, France, and Italy. By September of this year, Britain and France no longer participated due to the ongoing European war. Germany regards the entire southeastern Europe as the Axis powers' "space vital to survival." Therefore, it reorganized the Danube River International Conference again, so that only countries geographically adjacent to the Danube River Basin and countries with economic interests could participate. Italy, although not a coastal country, was allowed to participate in the conference for this reason. (17th Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Troops Reinforce Continuously; Intensify Siege of Bardia; Italian Prime Minister Orders Blackshirts to Defend to the Death; Fortifying Positions in Tobruk</h3>
<p>Cairo – An Italian senior military officer, captured here, told a United Press reporter yesterday that when the commander of Bardia was preparing to withdraw from the area, he suddenly received an emergency order from the Italian Governor of Africa, ordering them to defend the Italian military stronghold at all costs. The officer said that this was the intention of Prime Minister Mussolini. Governor Graziani of Africa is well aware that Bardia will eventually fall sooner or later. He is now planning to defend Tobruk, located a few miles west of Bardia, and the defense of that area has been strengthened. According to an Egyptian observer who recently returned from the British forward command, British soldiers and supply trucks are being transported to Bardia in large numbers and continuously on the road. Most interestingly, most of these troop carriers are Italian-made, either "Lancia" or "Fiat" brand. They are all in as-new condition and were seized by the British army from the Italian army. (28th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Lisbon – According to London news, semi-official sources believe that Bardia is different from Sidi Barrani.

<h3>Greek Troops Advance Through Snow in Freezing Weather; Offensive Continues to Progress; Albanian Anti-Italian Leader Leads Troops to Aid in Battle; British and Greek Air Forces Heavily Bomb Valona</h3>
<p>Struga: According to border reports, after a small half-day of fierce fighting between Italian and Greek forces at the confluence of the Haber River and the Susiča River on Thursday, the Italians suffered a crushing defeat. Many Italians were caught in the crossfire of Greek machine gun squads and fled into the Susiča River (in the coastal area), where many drowned. The Greek army is now planning to advance along the Susiča River valley to capture Valona. It is worth noting that the Greek army has now pursued to the area of activity of Albanian rebel forces. The battle on Thursday was personally assisted by the famous Albanian anti-Italian leader, Billia Tout, who commanded his troops. Six British and Greek aircraft heavily bombed Valona on Friday morning, causing significant damage, with 19 deaths and 50 injuries. The gasoline depot in the northern part of the port was also bombed. Furthermore, the Greek army on the Oshan River bombarded the Italian army all day on Thursday and occupied the village of Vereya on Friday. (United Press report on the 28th)</p>

Many were captured in the area of the Triilos River. The Greek army has erected strongholds on the occupied heights to control the area leading to the northern passes of Tepeleni. Although the area further north is covered in deep snow, the Greek army continues to repel the Italian army. It is reported that the Greek army has been assisted in combat by troops led by a certain Albanian anti-Italian leader. The Greek army's right wing advanced from the southwest and, after two hours of fierce fighting, forced the Italian army to retreat across the only remaining bridge over the deep Bopoly River. (Reuters report on the 28th)</p>
<p>Athens: A Greek official spokesman recently stated that although the weather has been extremely cold in recent days, the Greek army has continued to make progress and has advanced towards Valona (an Italian supply base on the Albanian coast) and Elbasan (a strategic stronghold in central Albania where Italian troops are concentrated). They have also made significant progress. The Greek army captured some enemy soldiers in the central front line near Trinos. To the north, the Italians attempted a counter-offensive, but were all repelled, and the Greek army captured several villages. The northern front line is covered in snow, which hinders military operations. (Reuters report on the 28th)</p>
<p>London: A Reuters correspondent cabled from Neoti in northern Albania that wolf packs are frequently seen searching for food in the snow in the high mountains of northern Albania. Heavy fog combined with three or four feet of snow in the past three days has slightly slowed the Greek army's advance. The Greek army is now fighting three Italian divisions in heavy fog. These Italian troops were recently reinforced by the "Bassagleyri" unit, which is known for its rapid marching. However, due to the heavy fog, the two armies cannot see each other even though they are only 200 yards apart. The Greek army has acted with agility, using ropes to drag troops and cannons up steep cliffs. (Reuters report on the 28th)</p>

<h3>German and Italian Newspapers Warn the United States Not to Send Ships to Southern Ireland; Otherwise, Germany May Sink Them; Ireland Has Taken Emergency Measures</h3>
<p>New York: According to reports from Berlin, German newspapers warned last night that if American ships sail into Irish ports, Germany will sink them. All newspapers issued warnings to the United States, believing that if the US Congress amends the Neutrality Act to allow American ships to sail into Irish ports, the American ships will be sunk and the United States will find itself at war. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German newspapers issued a strong warning to the United States yesterday, stating that if American ships risk sailing into the Irish Sea, the Germans may sink them. They also stated that if the United States sends ships to Irish ports to aid Britain, the United States may risk being drawn into the war. The German warning emphasized that the waters around Ireland are included in Germany's total blockade zone. This warning originated from official authorization and was further emphasized by the statement of Goebbels, Hitler's mouthpiece. Germany issued a warning last Saturday stating that the detention of Axis ships in US ports would be considered an "act of war." The new Nazi warning to the United States was prompted by news arriving in Berlin from New York. Following the German warning last Saturday, the news stated that Britain had made a proposal to designate Irish ports as a central zone and allow American ships to enter. US President Roosevelt is considering this. A Nazi editorial warned that Hitler had included Ireland in the blockade line several months ago, so sending American ships to Ireland would not only risk being sunk.

<p>London: Although German newspapers warned the United States not to send ships to Southern Ireland, Rome has assured Southern Ireland that if it is forced to defend itself against British tyranny and aggression, the Axis powers will provide full assistance. Rome Radio stated last night that Southern Irish Prime Minister de Valera's Christmas Day speech explained the truth of the current situation between Britain and Southern Ireland. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>De Valera Reaffirms Strict Neutrality</p>
<p>Berlin: Last night, Southern Ireland took new emergency measures to maintain neutrality to deal with Britain's restrictions on its commerce and the increasing attention of belligerent nations to Ireland. At the same time, Southern Irish Prime Minister de Valera, in view of the uncertain difficulties in maintaining supplies, has imposed strict restrictions on the distribution of gasoline. Observers stated that de Valera recently delivered a speech reaffirming strict neutrality in the European war, so his determination to prohibit the supply of military goods to Britain has not wavered. At the same time, de Valera vehemently criticized rumors that Britain wanted to use some Irish ports as naval bases, stating that his government would not consider this request. De Valera also ridiculed the news that German submarines are using the Irish coast. Observers also said that the British government, in view of the recent heavy ship losses and the importance of Irish coastal bases in the fight against German submarines, is continuing to exert pressure on the Irish government to lease bases in Southern Ireland to Britain.

<h3>Pétain Agrees to Economic Cooperation with Germany; Considers Forming a Core Cabinet</h3>
<p>London: The morning newspapers here are speculating about the demands made by Germany on the Vichy government or the possible results of "Alas-Medun." Some say that French President Marshal Pétain has clearly rejected this request. If Germany attempts to occupy the remaining areas of France or insists that the French fleet must be taken over by the Axis powers, Pétain and his government are prepared to move to North Africa. As of now, none of the above statements have been verified. However, most critics say that Pétain agrees to economic cooperation with Germany, but does not seem to be delving further into military cooperation. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3>German Warship Bombards Nauru Island; Australian Prime Minister Condemns in Strong Terms; Britain and the Netherlands Lay Mines in the Pacific; Efforts to Search for German Raiders</h3>
<p>Canberra: Australian Prime Minister Menzies yesterday condemned the recent bombardment of Nauru Island by a German warship flying the Japanese flag, saying that this was another example of the Germans disregarding the morality of civilized nations. Menzies also said that the island was completely undefended in accordance with the League of Nations regulations. Although the losses were heavy, fortunately there were no casualties. (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: This morning, a Navy Ministry spokesman stated that he had not received any information to verify the news reported from Melbourne, Australia yesterday, that Australian Prime Minister Menzies claimed that a German raider, flying the Japanese flag, had bombarded Nauru Island. Nauru Island is one of the Gilbert Islands, located in the South Pacific. It formerly belonged to Germany and is now administered by Australia under a League of Nations mandate. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>New York: The US Navy Headquarters issued a notice stating that all ships heading to the ports of the Fiji Islands must first go to Suva, the capital of the islands, starting from January 1st next year. Based on this notice, the general public speculated that Britain is now making efforts to search for German raiders in the South Pacific. Maritime industry insiders believe that controlling all ships in Suva will make it difficult for raiders to purchase their daily necessities in the small island harbors. It is generally believed here that British and Dutch warships have laid mines in some areas in the hope of capturing the raiders. (Reuters, 28th)</p>

<h3>Pan American Company Plans to Expand Air Network; Valuable for Commerce and Politics; Japan Will Also Open a South Seas Route</h3>
<p>New York Aviation News: Pan American Airlines General Manager Trippe recently made a speech outlining the company's development plans for the coming year, implying that it will do its best for national defense in the capacity of a private company. He said: "The important tasks of our company at present are threefold. The first step is to extend the Pacific route to Singapore, which can be realized within this year. This route is used to connect the Far East, and it has important value in both commerce and politics. Because there is no rapid transportation equipment between the United States and the Far East, and the interests of the United States in that area are becoming increasingly important, it is imperative to expand the air network to that area. The second step is to open non-stop flights across the Atlantic starting next spring, with one flight every day and night. It is expected that the new large aircraft ordered by our company will be completed at that time, so that it can carry more passengers on the one hand and double the speed on the other hand. As for the third step, it is planned to open daily air services between the United States and major cities in Latin America starting next summer. The line from New York to the capital of Argentina is expected to be reached within 24 hours." (Havas)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Asahi Shimbun reported that Japan will open a new air route on January 8th to quickly connect important locations on the islands in the South Seas under Japanese administration. The route passes through the Palau, Truk, Pohnpei, Kosrae, and Jaluit islands, with a total length of 3,873 miles, taking eight days to travel back and forth, and flying once every two weeks. The flight will start from the Palau Islands on January 8th. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Free French Movement Established in the Philippines; Led by Wahl, Preparing to Support Britain</h3>
<p>Manila: The Free French Movement under the leadership of de Gaulle has been established in Manila. Its leader is Major Wahl, a former mercenary of the French artillery. He said yesterday, "The French in the Philippines are ready to support Britain." Major Wahl also said, "Vichy's attitude can be seen from its belief in Germany's final victory. They will soon realize their mistake. The incorporation of France into Hitler's Europe is contrary to the traditional creed of establishing French democracy." (Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Special Feature: US Ambassador to Japan, Grew</h3>
<p>His final promotion was in 1927 when he was appointed as the ambassador to Turkey, with an annual salary of 17,500 yuan. This position was quite leisurely, and his main task was to contact Kemal. His methods were very clever. He deliberately lost money to his host during all-night poker games. He also swam across the Bosphorus Strait, to the surprise of the Turks.</p>
<p>Ambassador Grew was born into an old family of Boston bankers. He was the third child in the family, and his lifelong career began before he left the nursery. His nanny was very strict. Whenever he was naughty and refused to listen, she would put him on a special small chair and tell him not to get down. One day, he hoped to have some friends come and play with him. But the friends had not yet arrived, and he had already violated the rules and was sentenced by the nanny to sit on the chair. After a while, guests came and drank tea and talked in the living room. Grew had no choice but to carry the chair into the room. Being able to weigh the importance of words and spirit is the first major requirement of a good ambassador, and he had already clearly revealed it in this performance.</p>
<p>Grew's early education was nothing special, indicating that he would be another successful banker in the future. He first went to elementary school, and spent several summers in Menziesde. As a young man, Grew often went to his great-grandfather's estate outside Hyde Park Town on Sundays to hunt birds, learn to play the piano, collect stamps, or attend tea parties in the family. When he was studying at Glorton, he still retained the nature of his childhood. In Harvard University, he was so enthusiastic about studying religion that he had no time to socialize. He has the characteristic of perseverance, and can often give full play to his strengths. Although he was not a famous athlete, he did win the championship in the one-mile race. Although he was not a writer, he also presided over the student union and served as an editor.</p>
<p>Grew's loyalty to his alma mater is very touching. When Harvard University held its tricentennial celebration, he would rather give up everything to attend and serve as a steward. When Harvard and Yale Universities held boat races, unless there was a particularly important event, he would always listen quietly to shortwave radio broadcasts to report the results of the two schools' competitions. The ambassador also liked to attend dinners or clubs of his classmates. His speeches were seemingly confident and diplomatic, but in reality were empty.</p>
<p>There are two types of wealthy men in Boston: one is determined to engage in commerce, and the other is determined to travel around. Grew belongs to the latter. After graduating from Harvard University, he suggested to his father that he would travel around the world before engaging in banking business. After a hasty tour of Europe, he rushed to Singapore to meet with his two pre-arranged travel companions, Wheeler and Panley. The three traveled together to Malaysia, India, China and other places. Along the way, encountering two kinds of Asian animals, "flying elephants" and "big worms," aroused his enthusiasm for joining the diplomatic world, and eventually he was able to realize his wish.</p>
<p>The adventure of the "flying elephant" was in the jungle of Java. The so-called "flying elephant" is actually the nickname of a poisonous mosquito. At that time, Grew and his companions were tracking tigers, leopards, bears and deer. Unexpectedly, like the mantis stalking the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind, a "flying elephant" followed Grew in the dark and bit him, resulting in a near-fatal case of malaria. Four coolies put him in a hammock and carried him to Singapore, and then sent him to northern India to recuperate. On the way to Mumbai, the fever recurred and the illness was more serious than before. William, the American Consul General, often went to see him. One day, in his delirium, he threw books, oranges, bananas, and vases at the visitors. Fortunately, Mr. Fei was kind-hearted and did not mind at all. What he talked about was the diplomatic work, which was full of interest. From then on, it touched Grew's heart and he decided to become a diplomat.</p>
<p>This poisonous mosquito aroused Grew's great ambition, but later it was a "lynx" that enabled him to achieve his goal. Grew toured the scenery of India, and also hunted six mountain goats, two black bears, and several wild animals in Palston, and then set off to Xiamen to hunt tigers. A group of Chinese people, holding steel forks, helped him drive a "big worm" into a cave. Grew slithered in and lay on the ground. His face was only four feet away from the tiger. He aimed at the vitals and fired three shots in a row. The tiger struggled for a while and then died straight.</p>
<p>Grew returned to his hometown of Boston, bored for days, rewriting his travel diary into a book, while patiently waiting for an opportunity to join the diplomatic world. At this time, President Roosevelt was looking for the stimulation of hunting giant beasts. One day, Grew's friend in the tennis club, who is now Attorney General Korlay, suggested to President Roosevelt that he give Grew a diplomatic position. Roosevelt roared, "We don't need silk-stockinged Bostonians." Korlay presented Grew's manuscript to Roosevelt, and added a comment, "This is a stimulating work worth reading."</p>
<p>Roosevelt read Grew's work with great interest, and immediately summoned him for an interview. After a conversation, he sent him to serve as the secretary of the US Consulate General in Cairo, Egypt, and wrote a preface to his "Hunting in the Far East," saying, "You climbed through narrow stone paths and went straight into the tiger's den. You killed the tiger at a distance of less than four feet. This amazing adventure is the first time I have ever seen it in my life. You are both courageous and knowledgeable, and your writing is also vivid. It is a great joy for our diplomatic world to have this person."</p>
<p>The floor of Grew's study was once covered with that tiger skin, the ferocity of which made people feel frightened. Later, Mrs. Grew thought it was too terrible, so she moved it away. Now this tiger skin is still stored in the cold storage room in Washington.</p>

<h3>Principal Cheng Tianfang Reports on the General Situation in Sichuan, Plans to Add a Teachers College Next Year</h3>
<p>(Chengdu Airmail) The National Sichuan University Rong-based Alumni Association held a meeting in the Youth Association Auditorium on the 16th to welcome Principal Cheng Tianfang. More than 100 alumni attended. Mr. Cheng delivered a speech on the relocation of Sichuan University to Emei, the current situation of the university, the financial situation, and the plan to add a teachers college next year, providing a detailed report. His earnest encouragement to the graduating alumni was extremely sincere. Mr. Cheng said, "After the relocation of Sichuan University to Emei, the material facilities are far inferior to those in the provincial capital. Initially, teachers and students felt inconvenience, but today it has become a habit. Moreover, we have magnificent mountains and rivers, and beautiful river views, which provide us with infinite joy. In the nurturing of nature, teachers and students are united, studying from morning to night, without the unnecessary social interactions of the city, and the disturbances of air raid alarms. We can all concentrate our energy. We have never suspended classes for a single day due to air raids in recent years. This year, many universities postponed the start of school due to difficulties during the summer vacation, but Sichuan University's environment is unique, and it did not exceed the deadline. Even the new students were able to arrive at school on time. This is something that other universities have not been able to do. These gains can compensate for the lack of material things with surplus. When we moved to Emei last year, some people were afraid of not being accustomed to the life and held opposing views. Thinking about it now, we are really fortunate to have completed the relocation at that time. If it were today, with the skyrocketing prices, difficulties would inevitably arise. Because at that time, the total relocation cost was only 40,000 yuan, while recently, the Southwest Associated University received a relocation fee of 1 million yuan from the Ministry of Education, but it was still not enough. After the relocation to Emei, repairing temples and building dozens of auditoriums, classrooms, and dormitories only cost more than 100,000 yuan. Looking back at the old campus in Chengdu, it has been bombed. If we had not moved, there would have been a risk of suspension for several months, and the repair costs would not have been less than 100,000 yuan. In short, the discussion about Sichuan University in the past year, both internally and externally, can be summarized with the word "stability." After all, considering the state of various universities, this is also a difficult thing. Therefore, the government is deeply satisfied with Sichuan University and is eager to promote its development. Sichuan University now has a total of 1,376 students. This year's funding was originally 530,000 yuan, which is less than the 720,000 yuan when it was first established. Fortunately, the Ministry of Education's various subsidies increased to 400,000 yuan, which was barely enough. The budget for next year has been approved by the Executive Yuan at 660,000 yuan, and the Ministry of Education has approved an additional 150,000 yuan for the establishment of a teachers college, totaling 810,000 yuan. As long as I do not leave the school for a single day, I will fulfill my responsibility for a single day, and strive to achieve the goal of not defaulting on teachers' salaries and not reducing public funds. Furthermore, Sichuan University now has a freshman camp, which allows freshmen from various colleges to receive centralized military training. The spirit is excellent, and all parties have a good impression. In short, everything in Sichuan University is progressing. I and all of you should be pleased with this. I hope that alumni outside the school will often contact the alma mater. I have high hopes for the alumni outside the school. Although there are many universities in Sichuan at present, they will soon be moved away. In fact, there are only a few universities in the southwestern provinces, and the population of these provinces reaches 80 million, with a land area of more than 2.2 million square miles, which is equal to the sum of the territories of England, Germany, Italy, and France in Europe. To put it bluntly, Sichuan University, among all universities, is in a leading position today in terms of the number of students and facilities. Finally, Mr. Cheng encouraged all the students with three points: (1) Hope that all students enrich their work ability, (2) Students should be united in sincerity, (3) Maintain close contact with the alma mater."</p>
<h3>Educational Circles Jointly Advocate Charity Sale of New Year Cards</h3>
<p>(Daguang Agency) The Municipal Education Association believes that the New Year is approaching, and social customs include sending New Year cards. At a time when everything is expensive, the consumption of New Year cards is indeed a huge waste. Therefore, it has formulated a self-made New Year card charity sale to donate money, and promote various groups and schools to actively implement it. It is reported that many schools have followed the implementation and are currently promoting it universally, in order to have good results. The relevant measures are recorded as follows: (1) Purpose: To save New Year card consumption and use it for New Year air defense donations. (2) Measures: 1. Teachers guide students to draw by themselves in art class. 2. Openly exhibit on campus and hold regular charity sales, at least five cents per card. 3. All proceeds from the charity sale will be used as New Year air defense donations. (3) Payment procedures: Schools collect the money and then submit it to Zhengyan Bao for collection, which will be published daily to ensure credibility.</p>
<h3>Youth Association to Hold Concert Tonight</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Association will hold a grand concert in the auditorium of the association at 8 o'clock tonight to promote music.

Ms. Kuang graduated from Yanjing University and the National Conservatory of Music, and is a student of Mr. Chaharov. She will soon go abroad for further study. Xu Qilin studied in Belgium for eight years and is one of the few violinists in China. Su Shilin is a world-renowned bass singer. This conference is indeed a rare opportunity.</p>
<h3>Education Briefs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Hambury Road Western Children's Public School originally planned to move to Jessfield Road for classes. Due to various inconveniences, it has been decided to stop the relocation. The Sichuan Provincial Middle School Winter Vacation Graduation Examination will be held in mid-January.</p>
<p>The training class for directors of popular education centers in various provinces, organized by the Ministry of Education, has ended after a total of three sessions. The trainees have all returned to their posts one after another. The Ministry of Education has now sent inspector Wang Yizhou (formerly the director of the training class for directors of popular education centers) to inspect the recent work in seven counties in Sichuan Province, including Changshou and Dianjiang.</p>

<h3>Donghua Reserve Cup Wins the Final Right, Eliminates St. Francis 9-0, Jewish Also Wins the Final Right</h3>
<p>The Reserve Cup Football Championship, a new product after the war, was won by Laskers in the first edition last year. In this edition, after the preliminary competition, Donghua, Jewish, St. Francis and Laskers advanced to the quarter-final week. Yesterday, Laskers met Jewish at the Racecourse, while Donghua met St. Francis at Jiaozhou Park. St. Francis' strength was flat, and it was unbearable for the all-round Donghua to strike. Donghua used all reserve troops yesterday, only using Fei Chunhua and Wan Jin of the First Division on both wings. Because the First Division of St. Francis had a battle at the Racecourse, they met Laskers, and the battle situation passed under one-sidedness from beginning to end. Donghua took a 6-0 advantage in the first half. As a result, Donghua successfully advanced to the final week with a huge score of 9-0. Another Jewish Association also eliminated Laskers 5-3, and the final will be held on the 18th of next month to win this year's championship.</p>

<p>New Six Cup Finals Produce an Upset</p>
<h3>Gonghua Loses to Evening Glow</h3>
<p>Unexpected score of 1-6</p>
<p>The tenth battle of the New Six Cup table tennis finals was held at the Zhejiang Yuqiu Room the night before last. In the past record of Gonghua vs. Evening Glow A, Gonghua Association defeated the always-victorious Huayi A team, while Evening Glow once suffered a惨 defeat of 1-6 to Huayi. In yesterday's battle, Evening Glow could steadily win against Xinya but not win, and its vigor was greatly frustrated. Therefore, Gonghua's victory over Evening Glow can be said to be no problem at all. Unexpectedly, after the list of both sides was announced, Gonghua actually put the main force at the rear, and the front line was weakened. Jianjiang Pan Rixi lost to Liu Zaoshi in three straight games, which was also unexpected. Chen Ruilong performed abnormally, which led to a惨 murder by Ding Zhiming, the reserve member of Evening Glow, which affected the overall situation of Gonghua. As a result, Gonghua suffered a惨 defeat to Evening Glow with a huge score of 1-6, which was really unexpected and the only major upset in the six-strong finals. Gonghua has lost the hope of winning the runner-up. Now the three teams of Evening Glow Xinya each have two wins and two losses, and they will hold a rematch within the next week to determine who will be the third runner-up.</p>

<p>The Siyou Cup individual table tennis championship was held in the club's ball room at No. 6, Ruikangli, Beijing Road at 7:00 last night. A total of seven matches were held, and the battle situation was quite fierce.

At noon today, the hardest US exchange rate for January had opened at 5.59375 yuan.

HSBC sucked in spot US exchange, which had cheaply reached five yuan five six two five. The HSBC listing was announced, and there were no ups and downs. After that, Chinese merchants and speculators slammed in, and the potential was quite loose. The Chinese exchange leaving the bank for the next month was five yuan five nine three seven five.

<h3>Cash Falls Sharply Again, Price is 50 Yuan Lower than Futures Delivery</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was small and erratic, and the price fluctuated around the 6,500 yuan mark, showing a situation of falling first and then returning. Because HSBC suddenly came to exchange US dollars, the price stopped loosening and suddenly returned, so the price retreated to 6,430 yuan in a scattered manner. Later, with the help of gold shops and silver shops, it once soared to 6,520 yuan. Later, because of the decline in cash and the gold price was too high according to the US exchange rate, speculators came to sell. Therefore, it fell several times, and finally closed at 6,500 yuan, with a reduction of 35 yuan. According to the US exchange rate of 5 yuan 53125 for January, the settlement price was 6,316 yuan, with an increase of 184 yuan. The transaction volume in half a day was six or seven thousand taels. No market in the afternoon on Saturday. The cash price fell sharply again. A certain silver shop sold 40 taels of cash to the cash shop, and the price was 50 yuan lower than the futures delivery. Later, there were no more buyers. The inquiry was because the end of the year was approaching, and more and more people were asking for cash late in the evening. The silver shop's white gold was also 10 yuan lower, at 660 yuan. Guanyu and others were flat.</p>
<p>Hearsay Red Falls Again by 35 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the price of each bar (ten taels) fell to 6,400 yuan due to the weakening of foreign exchange reports and the fatigue of the previous day's closing price. It is said that there were many transactions. When the market opened at 9:15, the price was 6,445 yuan, which was 90 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous day. Subsequently, in the chaos, it was slightly inferior to 6,430 yuan. A certain silver shop and gold shop came to compete to enter, and the US dollar stopped loosening and suddenly returned. Retail investors also rushed to buy, and the price soared to 6,500 yuan, soaring 90 yuan, reaching 6,520 yuan. Because the remittance merchants came to sell fiercely, and the securities gangs also came out, they saw the market falling by more than 60 yuan, falling to 6,457 yuan. When they heard that the US dollar of 5 yuan 5625 this month was also difficult to settle, people's hearts were shocked. The silver shop and the securities gang (re-entered) competed to buy, and the price rose to 6,510 yuan. The range of ups and downs was narrower, and there were remittance merchants selling. The closing price was 6,500 yuan, which was 35 yuan lower than the closing price of the previous night. After the closing, it rose to 6,520 yuan, which was ten yuan higher than the outside price after the closing of the previous day. There were 90 yuan of ups and downs in the first half of the day. In the afternoon, because there was no market on Saturday, the selling price of the cash shop's own brand gold was more than 20 yuan lower than the hearsay red futures delivery. The receipt was 50 yuan lower than the sale. There was no market or price for the spot gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold is Lowered by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of silver jewelry gold per tael, Datonghang and Xintonghang initially listed at 672 yuan, and at 9:30 it was 10 yuan lower, which was 660 yuan. The receipt was reduced by 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market conditions, the hearsay red market price continued to weaken, so the British, American and gold pounds also continued to decline by one yuan. The British gold ticket remained unchanged as before, and the market price stood flat. The American gold ticket once retreated to 18 yuan and 5 cents, and then returned to 18 yuan and 22 cents, which was 5 cents lower than the previous day's final drop. The supply of Hong Kong tickets was strong, and the market price continued to decline. The supply and demand of Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets were equal, and the market price stood flat. The former was still 1 yuan and 61 cents, and the latter was still 1 yuan and 34 cents.</p>
<h3>Food, Rice Market Settles Down</h3>
<p>The price of foreign rice continued to flatten yesterday. The general market goods have been able to comply with the limited sales, and the price of Saigon No. 2 rice was 81 yuan and a half. Broken rice was 76 yuan, and second-grade broken rice was 68 yuan and 63 yuan. Fire small and twisted and other types were all traded within the limit. Although the two highest grades are still holding out and not selling, the market has indeed gradually entered a smooth path. The price of each rice sold yesterday was smaller than the previous market by a few yuan. A certain foreign rice in the futures market sold Siamese rice No. 1 at 94 yuan, which was loaded and sold, and people's hearts were even more empty. The set price of Saigon small twisted was also close, so most households waited and watched. After the small twisted in January once opened at 84 yuan and a half, there was no further opening. The asking price of the goods was smaller than the previous market by one yuan or less. The overall transaction was greatly 清淡 after the brokers stopped entering the market. Yesterday's spot rice transaction was less than 3,000 bags, and futures were only about 100 tons.</p>
<p>The source of thick rice and other national rice is still limited. The seller's heart is firmer, and the sales market is normal. The price of Kunshan斛 yuan white rice is 100 yuan to 97 yuan, and Qingjiao斛 sees thin rice at 92 yuan to 90 yuan.</p>
<p>The departure of glutinous rice is slightly more than before. Not only do rice carriers purchase it, but also cake shops and workshops are also quite aggressive. The market price has also stabilized, and there is no change. Yili white yuan is still 95 yuan, and Hong Kong white yuan is 85 yuan and a half and 83 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice and corn also came to Shanghai. Jiaohe Foreign Bank Yuesheng Wheel brought 3,119 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and 400 bags of corn. The previous day (27th) arrived at the port and berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. In addition, Taikoo Company's Guiyang Wheel also loaded 718 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, and arrived in Shanghai yesterday and berthed at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading.</p>
<h3>After the Order is Confirmed, Foreign Flour Has Turned to a Downward Trend</h3>
<p>Flour Yesterday, foreign flour has turned to a downward trend. During the weekend, the actual sales of the goods have not progressed, and the foreign pricing is still low. After the new fixed transaction is confirmed, the foreign flour stored in the Shanghai market is sufficient for supply. People's hearts are inevitably lazy. The unified market sells Huashen brand at 22 yuan and 8 cents, Meili brand at 22 yuan and 7 and a half cents, and Zhonglou Huaniao brand at 22 yuan and 6 cents, which is one or two cents lower than before. The transaction volume is more than 6,000 bags. The original plate of the local flour factory is still maintained at 18 yuan. The two factories sold more than 5,000 bags. It is said that new fixed measures may be implemented by the end of the Gregorian calendar year and in January next year.</p>
<p>In addition, foreign flour has also arrived at the port. Jiaohe Foreign Bank Yuesheng Wheel came to Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday. In addition to carrying foreign rice and corn, there were also 1,000 bags of flour and 6,500 bags of corn. It was transported to Yantai yesterday.</p>
<p>Wheat Yesterday's wheat transaction was very quiet. It was found that the domestic and foreign supply sources were quiet. It was rumored that the foreign wheat previously ordered by the Chinese factory would arrive. It is said that the ship has already sailed, and it will probably arrive in late January. It is even more lacking to transport inland Du wheat to Shanghai. There are occasional arrivals, all of which are designated for delivery to Japanese factories. Therefore, the market transaction is as usual.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers, Not Lacking to Drag In at Low Prices, Yarn Market Rises Again After Fatigue</h3>
<p>Yesterday's yarn market, which had been up and down greatly the previous day, returned to a quiet path, and turned from fatigue to strong. The amount of "foreign customers" has dropped in price, not only with no intention of spitting it out, but also with the appearance of continuing to advance. However, the speculation of general retail investors is constantly entering and exiting, which is very lively. As for a certain large household in the industry, in view of the fact that the environment is not beneficial to shorts, it absorbed a huge amount in the morning when the market opened. There were tens of bags. At the same time, Shengda first came out and then entered, so the depressed yarn market turned upward until the close. However, there was no large-scale progress in actual transactions, and the scattered purchases were still able to support it. It was found that there were 1,220 pieces of cotton yarn transported to Hong Kong today (29th).</p>
<p>Shuangma opened in the morning due to the poor popularity in the afternoon of the previous day. The shorts were very active and the market was able to be desolate. The opening price of the first plate was 1,390 yuan. This plate was disturbed by the scalpers and shorts calling out to sell, and the market was quite loose, falling straight to 1,380 yuan. After being compensated by the profitable ones, it rose to 1,386 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened slightly longer, and the seller's pressure was very high, falling again to 1,378 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain large household in the industry searched the market and ate in as much as possible, with a few thousand bags. The market situation gradually turned to rise, and Niu Da also came to drag in at the same time, soaring straight to 1,394 and 5 yuan. Those who made money in the middle slightly came out, and then returned to a few yuan. The closing fork was fully 1,394 yuan. It was found that the statistics of the amount bought by each gang in half a day were divided as follows:</p>
<p>Same industry 5,220 Hong Kong 280</p>
<p>Statistics 5,580</p>
<p>Afternoon Yarn Market Ang, the price of 20-count Shuangma was 1,398 yuan, up 7 yuan from the morning.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market as Stable as Before</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still firm. Although the factory side does not purchase a large amount, the yarn market is rising, and the holders of goods are in a very consolidated state, and they will never be willing to move. Therefore, the transaction is not complicated, but the American and Indian cotton markets have been rising recently.</p>
<p>Another message about foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market, the market situation is firm, first because of speculative purchases, and then because of the high stock prices and the purchases of the same industry. As a result, the closing price was higher than the previous day by 89 pounds. India rose more than three rupees yesterday.</p>
<p>The transaction of Shanghai foreign cotton has been extremely quiet recently. The factory side wants to buy but is unwilling to pay a high price, and the same industry is unwilling to sell cheaply. Therefore, the cotton market has become a good situation.</p>
<h3>Securities: Public Debt Shows Mixed Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The public debt grey market yesterday surprisingly failed to maintain the upward momentum of the previous day, instead showing a slump. Category C bonds once again broke through the four-yuan mark. Many large-scale bullish investors who had bought in the previous days continued to sell off yesterday. Since the bond market was hit by environmental factors, it has found it difficult to rebound. Currently, due to the impending expiration of interest payments, it may be able to remain stable. At the opening in the morning, Lianyi made purchases, and the market price was very firm. Later, with Lianhe, Yitai, and Shenchang selling off significantly, the price gradually eased, and the four-yuan threshold was quickly broken. Although Wantai and No. 14 attempted to support the market, the overall sentiment remained weak. In the afternoon, many investors bought, but the quantity was not large. Companies such as Sheng, Datong, Xinggong, Maomao, Lexin, and Fude all made some purchases. Category C bonds briefly rose to four yuan, but Tongkang, Hongda, and others came to sell again. Xiekang and Xieda also sold, so the price could not rise. In the end, Categories A, D, and C bonds improved slightly by one or two jiao, while the rest fell slightly by about one jiao. The total transaction volume was 1.78 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 100 shares of Xinxin Company were traded at a price of 20 yuan.</p>
<p>American China Securities Company: Has scheduled to pay the mid-term dividend for 194() on December 31st, with an annual interest rate of 6%.</p>

HSBC Bank's London-registered shares rose £2 to £75, and Hong Kong-registered shares rose £1 to £82, with quoted prices but no sales. Gulang Rubber shares were 4.5 pence at 15 shillings and 7.5 pence, the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Speculative Sentiment in Oil Beans Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for soybean oil, peanut oil, and soybeans uniformly declined. The reason is that the exchange rate is gradually easing, there is a lack of opportunity for manipulation, the general trend is over, and speculative bulls are heavily hit. Although some hoarding households are still buying on the cheap to raise prices, the overall trend is downward, and market prices are plummeting. Soybeans fell another half yuan, with more than 2,210 bags of various beans traded. Soybean oil continued to fall by one to one and a half yuan, with 150 barrels, 50 dans, and 30 pieces traded. Peanut oil was revised down by two to two and a half yuan, with 350 pieces and 3,200 cans traded. The above market prices are detailed in the market price column.</p>
<p>In addition, there are 1,210 bags of soybeans and 5,860 bags of soybean cakes today (29th), all being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Year-End Approaching, Cotton Cloth Sales Slow</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was stable yesterday. Some retail merchants continued to offer slightly cheaper goods, priced at around 2.5 jiao per piece. As the year-end approaches, transportation for merchant groups is difficult, and wholesale shops on this street are stepping up preparations for closing. Hoarding households have already absorbed a large amount of goods and are temporarily adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, actual transactions are even more sluggish. Retail goods, lacking buyers, are offered at slightly lower prices. Coarse and fine cloth fell by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao per piece. Some bleached and dyed cloth fell by around 2.5 jiao per piece. Over 300 pieces of various cloths were traded on this street. Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled over one hundred pieces of colored cloth twill and other goods. Zhejiang, Wenzhou, and Taizhou merchants handled fifty to sixty packages of fine cloth and colored twill.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The morning opening was sluggish due to the continued decline in yarn prices. Dragon Head fine cloth once fell to 41.2 yuan, but by the afternoon closing, it was reported that the standard gold had rebounded, and retail merchants compensated, rising to 41.5 yuan. The aftermarket grey market was firm and rising, trading at 41.6 or 41.7 jiao, but still down two or three jiao compared to the previous day's market. Four Gentlemen broadcloth was 1.19 yuan. Fine twill in the middle and lower grades continued to fall by five or six jiao, while high-end Dragon Head cloth was extremely scarce and still sold for 37.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports: Cotton cloth: Yesterday (28th), 200 pieces were shipped to Yantai. Today (29th), 700 pieces are being shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Prices Repeatedly Rise, Now at Nine Yuan</h3>
<p>Coal briquette prices: Since the price of raw coal dust increased some days ago, small stalls on the market have suddenly disappeared. Factories are also using the soaring cost as an excuse to limit sales to current stock on hand and not issue any more warehouse receipts. Starting yesterday, factory prices were uniformly increased to eight yuan. Nanyang, Yitai, and Guohua coal briquettes now cost 168 yuan per ton for self-pickup, plus three yuan for delivery. Retail prices at shops on this street are nine yuan per bundle (100 market catties), an increase of four jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Diao Qing Soon to Arrive</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to weaken due to the continued rise in foreign exchange rates, and prices fell again. The guild's quoted price for existing 24 coarse white sugar was 78 yuan at this warehouse, a drop of about one yuan. The initial spot price for Dutch red sugar was 63 yuan, then it fell to 62.8 yuan, and later recovered to 63.1 yuan and 9 jiao. The end-of-the-month trading price was 63.2 yuan to 64.1 yuan. Taikoo White B at the Western warehouse was 78 yuan, down 5 jiao. Old stock was 77.5 yuan. HX was 15.5 yuan, down 1.5 yuan. National Sugar: A letter from Zhangzhou reported that Diao Qing is about to appear fresh, but the production price has not been significantly eased.</p>
<h3>Southern and Northern Products: Quanzhou Longan Arrives Directly</h3>
<p>Quanzhou dried longan has been available for a long time, but due to transportation obstacles, except for some transshipment from Gulangyu, the first official batch of goods arrived in port on the Yongyuan Wheel the day before yesterday, totaling over a thousand pieces. Because water freight is still high, the cost has been difficult to reduce. Sales are not particularly strong, and the trend is relatively weak.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Artificial Silk Moves from Leak to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Artificial silk continues to arrive in Shanghai. Yizu Foreign Company's Yusheng Wheel transported 65 boxes of artificial silk from Hong Kong, arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday (27th). Also, Fusheng Wheel also loaded 30 boxes from Hong Kong, arriving yesterday. Both are stopping at Roosevelt Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Gardenia Yellow Shows New</h3>
<p>Arrivals of gardenia yellow from various places have been interrupted for a long time, and there is a shortage on the demand side. It is reported that the first batch of new goods from Jinjiang, totaling over a hundred pieces, has been transshipped and is currently being cleared through customs, and will be seen on the market soon.</p>
<h3>Economic Musings</h3>
<p>— Feng Liutang</p>
<p>Cigarettes (II)</p>
<p>Initially, cigarettes were only for the use of foreigners themselves. At that time, import tariffs stipulated that goods for the personal use of foreigners and not for resale to Chinese people were exempt from tax. This led to items like cigarettes, cigars, and foreign liquor gradually entering Chinese society as more Chinese people interacted with Westerners and adopted Westernized fashions. Imports increased, resulting in significant tax revenue losses. Therefore, in September of the 25th year of the Guangxu reign, Sheng Xuanhuai submitted a memorandum on raising funds, stating that "Recently, foreign cigarettes, liquor, medicines, utensils, and other items have been widely sold in China, not just for the personal use of foreign officials and merchants. Taxes should be increased accordingly." This shows that during this period, Chinese people's preferences gradually became more Europeanized.</p>
<p>Around this time, the most commonly smoked cigarette by Chinese people was the Pin Head brand. However, the most popular were the Peacock and Dragon brands. The reason why these two types of cigarettes were so popular among Chinese people was that they catered to the preferences of Chinese cigarette smokers. At that time, Chinese people were not yet accustomed to smoking cigarettes, and if they did not use a cigarette holder, half of the cigarette would be soaked with saliva as soon as it entered the mouth. Peacock and Dragon brands included six or seven waxed paper cigarette holders in each box of cigarettes, each about half an inch long, which could be connected to form a good cigarette holder. However, these two types of cigarettes soon disappeared. They were replaced by Pirate (Knife Brand) and Great Britain (also known as Powder Bag Ruby Queen) cigarettes.</p>
<p>Why was the oldest Pin Head brand not popular for a time in the beginning? This was influenced by international politics. In the 31st year of the Guangxu reign (1905 AD), the United States established a harsh exclusion policy for Chinese laborers. At that time, the Chinese people were awakening, and they began the first boycott movement against foreign goods, stirring up resistance in several southeastern provinces. Mr. Zeng Shaoqing was particularly enthusiastic in his efforts, traveling to various places to give lectures. Under the stubborn and jealous government, this was all the more commendable. Because the Pin Head brand was produced by an American tobacco company, in order to avoid the boycott, a British merchant came forward to continue its operation, and it became the B.A.T. (British American Tobacco Company) trademark!</p>
<p>Although cigarettes were imported from abroad, foreign merchants had already established factories in Shanghai to manufacture them during the 14th and 15th years of the Guangxu reign. It is said that the first one was the old Jinlong Foreign Company on the Suzhou River, which manufactured cigarettes on its three-story building, fearing that the Chinese would steal their methods, so they were very secretive and refused to allow visitors.</p>
<p>At that time, cigarettes only sold for thirty or forty cash per box (one silver dollar could be exchanged for nine hundred and thirty or forty cash). However, given the cost of living at the time, people still felt that cigarettes were too expensive, so they also released a type of cigarette with five sticks per pack, such as Drum Brand and Chicken Brand. As for the most popular high-quality cigarettes, the Second Gun Emplacement and Third Gun Emplacement were packaged in green paper boxes. Those who smoked First Gun Emplacement cigarettes were wealthy, but it was still only a little over a jiao per pack. At this time, the Double Happiness brand, produced by the Chinese-owned Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, gradually appeared on the market. Because it was a product manufactured by a factory owned by Chinese people themselves, young smokers in general greatly favored Double Happiness cigarettes. Moreover, the packaging of Double Happiness cigarettes was quite similar to that of Third Gun Emplacement, and each pack of twenty Double Happiness cigarettes also came with a bamboo cigarette holder, which was especially welcomed by new smokers. Following this came Flying Boat Brand and Student Brand, which were all tailored to the preferences of students. From then on, Chinese cigarette factories sprung up like bamboo shoots after rain, threatening to overwhelm foreign tobacco companies. Coupled with the rising tide of patriotism and support for domestic goods, the products of Chinese tobacco companies such as Nanyang's White Dragon, Great Wall, and Huacheng's Gold Mouse and Beauty became popular among the upper and middle classes. Seeing this situation, in 1935, the British-American Tobacco, Great American Tobacco, and Citibank Tobacco companies in Shanghai jointly formed the Yi Zhong Distribution Tobacco Company to compete with Chinese merchants. After the August 13th Incident, several large Chinese cigarette factories suffered a severe blow due to their factory locations. This was a temporary phenomenon, and they are still producing cigarettes, but the throne of cigarettes has shifted back to foreign tobacco factories.</p>
<p>Cigars are the famous Luzon cigars, which are known to be foreign goods. Although China also has imitations, they are not as good as those imported.</p>
<p>The tobacco leaves originally produced in China were rarely suitable for cigarette making. Therefore, in order to seek a local supply of raw materials, the British-American Tobacco Company specially sought out suitable soil in provinces such as Shandong and Henan, distributed tobacco seedlings, ordered farmers to plant them, and then bought them back. This has been quite successful, but since the North China Incident, procurement has become more difficult.</p>
<p>The tip of the tobacco leaf is the tenderest and is the best for making cigarettes. The most tender tobacco leaves are good for making cigarettes, but the taste is too light, and smokers do not feel satisfied. The majority of the tobacco leaves closer to the petiole are too old and can only be used to make inferior cigarettes. Therefore, only a small portion of the leaf near the tip is just right. When making cigarettes, the veins and stems of the tobacco leaves are removed, then finely shredded, and then rolled with paper. The extracted veins and stems are flattened and then finely chopped with a machine, and mixed with the shredded tobacco to make cigarettes. Therefore, when smoking ordinary cigarettes, sometimes some tobacco pieces will suddenly burst out of the cigarette, which are tobacco stems that have not been flattened or chopped finely enough. This makes smokers feel unpleasant. The reason why cigarettes are fragrant and have a mellow tobacco flavor is because they are mixed with sugar and alcohol. However, if too much is mixed, then when smoking, or in humid weather, small spots of yellow liquid will appear on the cigarette paper, making it unpleasant to smoke, and the cigarette will easily become moldy!</p>
<p>Cigarettes are even more irritating to the throat than pipe tobacco or water pipe tobacco. Not to mention anything else, just look at the fingers and teeth of cigarette smokers, which are often stained yellow-black, which shows how severely they are burned. As for toothaches, swollen gums, and inflammation of the throat and mouth, those are not even worth mentioning. Apart from opium, the author occasionally tried snuff and cigars, but as for water pipes, cigarettes, and dry tobacco, I am confident that I have considerable experience. I have had a twenty-seven-year history with cigarettes. Until the winter of the 20th year of the Republic of China, because my throat was hoarse to the point of being unable to speak, I underwent treatment by many doctors, but it was ineffective. Some advised me to quit smoking cigarettes, so one night I stopped smoking altogether. The next morning, a friend noticed that I was not smoking and thought that I had forgotten to bring cigarettes, so he offered me one. I told him the reason, and my friend laughed and said, "It's easy to make a burst of effort, but in less than half a year, you will return to your old habits." I replied that I would try it for now and see what happens later. Now, nearly ten years have passed, and I have not smoked a single cigarette. At first, my friends did not believe it, but later they all knew that I was sincere. From this, it can be seen that quitting smoking is not difficult, what is lacking is determination and perseverance! (The End)</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council previously planned to increase taxes starting next April due to a sudden increase in expenditures related to salary increases and allowances for Chinese and Western staff, resulting in a budget shortfall. However, at a regular meeting of the Board of Directors the day before yesterday, it was suddenly decided to increase the surcharge by 40% on the current Municipal General Rate (i.e., 18% plus a surcharge of 50%) and Land Tax collection rates starting from January 1, next year. A special meeting of foreign ratepayers will be convened on January 23, next year, to submit reports. The SMC Information Office also issued a proclamation yesterday explaining the reasons for bringing forward the tax increase. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Exchange Rate Declines, Expenses Increase</h3>
<p>Since the Bureau prepared this year's budget, various expenditures have increased sharply due to rising prices and tight foreign exchange. At the beginning of budget preparation, the exchange rate was originally set at four pence, and at the same time, it was expected that the temporary cost-of-living allowance for staff would remain unchanged at 40%. However, today the exchange rate has dropped to three pence and seven and a half pence, and the temporary cost-of-living allowance for junior staff has increased to 150%. In addition, rice subsidies for Chinese staff have also greatly increased. Due to these various reasons, the tax increase cannot be delayed. Therefore, it is planned to levy an additional surcharge of 40% on the current Municipal General Rate and Land Tax collection amount starting from January 1 next year, in order to increase revenue and provide financial support. If the tax increase is delayed until April next year, the proposed increase will have to be at least 50%. This is because in this time of inflation, the Bureau cannot control the situation, and various expenditures will inevitably continue to increase. As for another benefit for taxpayers at the special meeting of taxpayers to be held next month, the recommendations proposed by the Economic Committee regarding the new fee schedule for various licenses can take immediate effect.</p>
<h3>Meeting Tomorrow: Further Research</h3>
<p>According to a Píngmín Shè reporter who inquired with sources close to the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities yesterday, the SMC still needs to discuss the tax increase issue, so it has been decided to hold a special board meeting at the SMC tomorrow (i.e., next Monday) to specifically study this tax increase issue. According to the opinions of Chinese ratepayers, the SMC's current financial difficulties are indeed a fact, but the only remedy cannot be to repeatedly increase taxes without considering other ways to reduce government spending. During the ratepayer annual meeting in April of this year, a proposal to suppress prices within the Settlement was submitted and handed over to the SMC authorities.</p>
<h3>Citizens Hope: To Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>However, the SMC has not only had no effect on suppressing prices within the Settlement, but has also continued to increase them. It has no effective measures to suppress food prices within the Settlement. This has led to surging labor unrest within the Settlement and increased the cost-of-living allowances for SMC Chinese constables and all Chinese and Western staff. Therefore, residents throughout the city hope that the SMC will make the greatest effort to suppress prices and not just focus on increasing taxes to remedy the situation. The so-called "draining the pond to catch the fish" will make it difficult for Chinese people, who bear the greatest tax obligations, to cope.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Fares Will Increase Starting New Year's Day. Rickshaw Rentals Increase Also Approved by the Bureau. Streetcar Fares in the International Settlement Will Also Increase</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Guild, in view of the continuing price increases of various materials and the sharp increase in operating expenses for all guild members, making it difficult to cope, submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Council to approve an increase in rickshaw rentals to increase revenue and maintain operations. After comprehensive consideration, the Bureau deemed the request reasonable and approved an increase in the maximum rickshaw rental from 98 jiao per day to 1.4 yuan (including the rickshaw puller's contribution of 12 jiao to the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association) starting from January 1, next year. At the same time, rickshaw fares should be increased as follows:</p>
<p>Based on Distance:</p>
<p>15 jiao per half mile; 15 jiao for each subsequent half mile or portion thereof; Minimum fare: 15 jiao (originally 10 jiao)</p>
<p>Based on Time:</p>
<p>9 jiao per hour; 4.5 jiao for each subsequent half hour or portion thereof; Minimum fare: 9 jiao (originally 6 jiao)</p>
<p>In addition, the mutual aid association fee paid by rickshaw pullers should be increased from 7 to 12 jiao per rickshaw per day, starting from the same date, to increase the association's revenue to cope with expenses.</p>
<p>Streetcar Fares Will Also Continue to Increase</p>
<p>The English-language Dàměi Evening News reported that the Shanghai Electric Construction Company of the International Settlement has applied to the SMC to continue increasing streetcar fares. The Bureau is currently considering this application. According to Chinese-language newspaper reports, the SMC is expected to approve the streetcar company's application, and the new fares will take effect on January 1.</p>
<h3>Visas to Hong Kong Can Be Processed Through the China Travel Service. Obtain a Guarantee First, Then Collect Forms.</h3>
<p>The Hong Kong Government Immigration Department promulgated new entry control regulations on the 20th of last month, restricting the entry of people of any nationality. They were originally scheduled to take effect on the 18th of this month, but due to the inability to complete visa procedures in time, it was decided to postpone the start date to January 14, next year. According to a Píngmín Shè reporter who inquired with the China Travel Service yesterday, the Hong Kong government established these new restrictive conditions to prevent undesirable elements from entering the country. Therefore, the implementation date will no longer be postponed. The China Travel Service has now received application visa forms delegated for processing by the Immigration Department and is discussing the handling procedures. It is reported that after issuing the visa forms, the Immigration Department discovered that some people were forging these forms and selling them to travelers for profit, causing travelers to use forged forms when applying, which were discovered by the Hong Kong authorities. Therefore, after determining the agency procedures, the China Travel Service will require travelers from Shanghai to obtain a guarantee first before issuing visa forms. It is also reported that after the Immigration Department implements the new restrictions on the 14th of next month, it will not establish an office in Shanghai. The sailing dates of ships from major shipping companies in this port will also remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>President Coolidge Arrives in Port Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The American President Lines' President Coolidge is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning and berth at Pujiang's Floating Docks No. 10 and 23. After staying here overnight, it will set sail for Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and San Francisco, before returning to Los Angeles. Over one hundred American expatriates and forty missionaries from this port will take this ship back to the United States. As this is the only ship sailing to the United States this year, American expatriates who are unable to return to the United States this year will spend the New Year and wait for the ship to return to the United States. In addition, the second new ship in the World Class series built by the American Mail Line recently, the Monrovia, which is the same type as the Jackson, is also scheduled to set sail on its maiden voyage from the Newport News shipyard today, traveling around the world. It will arrive in Shanghai on February 6, next year, stay overnight, and then take the route through Hong Kong, Manila, Singapore, India, around South Africa's Cape of Good Hope, across the Atlantic Ocean, and return to New York. The ship's gross tonnage is 9,500 tons, and all internal equipment is as luxurious as that of the Jackson.</p>
<h3>Sir Victor Sassoon Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ta Tung Pao reported that Sir Victor Sassoon, a major Shanghai financier, returned to Shanghai on the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Asia Queen on the 26th of this month, after traveling to India for business in August. It is reported that Sir Victor Sassoon will handle various business interests in Shanghai and will leave Shanghai again in mid-January.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Volunteer Corps White Russian Unit To Be Reassigned to Police Department Effective January 15, Next Year. Commander and Treatment Remain Unchanged.</h3>
<p>The English-language Dàměi Evening News reported that the Shanghai Volunteer Corps White Russian Unit will be converted to the Shanghai Municipal Council Police White Russian Unit starting on January 15, next year, in accordance with the decision made by the SMC several months ago. It is reported that the White Russian Unit's commander will remain the same and will not be changed. The issue of uniforms has not yet been disclosed. The lives of the White Russian Unit members will not be changed. The White Russian Unit of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps was organized in January 1927. When the Battle of Shanghai broke out in 1937, the Unit was first mobilized, garrisoned in the Hongkou West District, and was responsible for guarding the Ward Road Jail, etc. Many police officers in the White Russian Unit of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police had served in the Volunteer Corps. In November 1936, another sixteen people transferred to the Police Department, forming the core of the White Russian Reserve Unit. Subsequently, more people joined, and the number of White Russian Reserve Unit personnel has greatly increased to this day.</p>
<h3>Far East American Retreat Nears Completion: Impact Foreseen in Potential US-Japan War</h3>
<p>Of the Americans in impacted areas, half of the elderly, infirm and women and children have already left.</p>
<p>According to the mainland press, the evacuation of American nationals from the Far East, as suggested by the U.S. State Department two months ago, is practically complete. The U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai has stated that the evacuation has been satisfactory in all respects. The exact number of American nationals who have already departed from the areas likely to be affected in the event of a U.S.-Japan war is still unknown. However, it is generally estimated that half of the American women, children, elderly and infirm residing in those areas have been evacuated. It is rumored that another large group of American nationals will leave China next month, and that they have already purchased tickets for regularly scheduled mail steamers.</p>
<p>Subsidized Rice Sale Scheduled for January 7th: Rice Market Investigators Increased, Grain Weevils Fearful</p>
<p>The Shanghai Subsidized Rice Committee convened a special meeting yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m. to discuss: (1) the date for the commencement of the eighth phase of subsidized rice sales. It was resolved that it would begin on January 7th (the tenth day of the lunar calendar) and last for fifteen days, ending on the 21st. (2) The establishment of subsidized rice distribution points. It was resolved that sixty distribution points would be set up in the two settlements, divided into thirty ticket-selling points and thirty rice-dispensing points, with members appointed by the Rice Merchants' Association to be responsible for operations. (3) The amount of rice to be sold per dollar. It was resolved that, due to higher purchase prices, each dollar would buy two "shih-chin" (market catties) of rice (equivalent to fifty yuan per "shih" - a unit of dry measure), with a limit of two yuan in national currency per person per day. (4) The daily limit for each distribution point. It was resolved that each distribution point would be limited to selling fifty bags per day, and that personnel would be dispatched daily to supervise each distribution point to prevent abuses. Other matters were briefly discussed.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Continue to Soften</p>
<p>The rice market has gradually improved since the previous market day. Yesterday, after the market opened, morale was low and prices fell by about one yuan compared to the previous market day. This indicates that the recent surge in rice prices was clearly due to hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. The authorities in the two settlements have increased the number of investigators stationed in the rice market to about ten. They are stationed in the market and among the crowds to investigate various clandestine transactions by rice merchants. If discovered, they will be arrested and punished. It is hoped that the supervisors appointed by the rice industry will also go to the market daily to assist in the investigation and arrests.</p>
<p>Grain Storage Committee</p>
<p>Each industry participating in the public warehouse grain storage of 200,000 bags has established its own grain storage committee. The remaining 13,500 bags that have not yet been allocated are rumored to have been taken up by the tobacco and other industries. It is also reported that the public warehouse grain storage subcommittee will be formally established on the 31st to begin operations. It is expected that once this grain storage plan is completed, there will be no shortage of food for the people by early spring next year. The industries have nominated Wang Yuqing from the industrial sector, Chen Ziyi and Zhu Zixiang from the rice sector, Lu Shuchen and Ye Fuxiao from the banking sector, representatives from the cotton mill sector have not yet been named, as well as He Dequi from the Public Works Department and Yu Qiaqing, to form the nine-member subcommittee.</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning's Lowest Temperature Dropped Below Freezing</p>
<p>The weather in Shanghai turned severely cold again starting yesterday morning. According to records from the Xujiahui Observatory, the lowest temperature at dawn fell below 0 degrees Celsius, or 31.1 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to an increase in the number of corpses found on the streets. The Pushan Cemetery collected and buried over sixty bodies of those who had died of exposure on the previous day alone. It has also been observed that the weather in Shanghai this winter, even in the depths of the season, has had fewer extremely cold days. The reason for this is that the Siberian high-pressure system has been less frequent than in previous years. However, winter is still long, and the arrival of extremely cold weather is still imminent.</p>
<p>Robbery at Shoe Store, Owner Shot</p>
<p>At Qian Fuxing Shoe Store, No. 224 Gansidong Road, six robbers arrived at 6 p.m. the night before. They brandished pistols and ordered everyone to be silent. Two robbers held guns to watch over the store owner, Qian Xingquan (also known as Fuxing), while the other four searched the store and found a burlap sack, into which they stuffed all the leather shoes. Unsatisfied, they attempted to open a safe to loot it, but the store owner, Qian, stepped forward to stop them, enraging one of the watching robbers who shot Qian in the waist, causing him to fall to the ground and die. The robbers, unable to carry the loot, fled in panic. The police transported Qian's body to the morgue for examination. Yesterday, Qian's son, Qian Anquan, claimed the body and sent it to the funeral home for preparation. It is said that various parties learned that the robbery and murder were instigated by someone from the same clan who hired outside bandits to carry out the crime. A report has been filed with the police in Pudong, requesting that they investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice to avenge the deceased.</p>
<p>American Missionary Narrowly Escapes Being Shot by Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>Repeatedly Encountered Danger En Route to Shaoguan: Japanese Aircraft Fiercely Strafe, Fortunately Miss</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports that the American Church in Shanghai recently received a letter from a female missionary, Hilti, from Guangdong, describing the perilous situation she and other missionaries encountered en route to Shaoguan. She stated that they repeatedly saw Japanese aircraft wreaking havoc in the distance along the way. On the morning of November 30th, as they were traveling by boat, they saw two Japanese aircraft flying low over the river. The aircraft then turned back, and fearing being bombed, they and the boatmen waded ashore to hide on a sandbar. Two male and female missionaries were hiding not far from each other when they were suddenly strafed by the Japanese aircraft. Bullets flew back and forth, but fortunately, no one was hit. The next morning, while walking along the river, they saw two Japanese aircraft flying over and strafing boats, but there were no casualties. They then boarded trucks and arrived in Shaoguan. Shortly after noon that day, the Shaoguan railway station was bombed by Japanese aircraft, causing a fire. The British Church on Main Street narrowly escaped being affected. According to information received by the American Church in Shaoguan, church properties in Chengdu were also bombed, destroying four or five buildings and injuring several people.</p>
<p>Two Schoolchildren Kidnapped Within One Hour Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>One Renzhong, One Changrong Born</p>
<p>Abducted and Disappeared on the Way to School Early in the Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, within the span of one hour, two kidnapping cases occurred in the two settlements. One involved Wang Renzhong, the son of the general manager of the New China Bank, and the other involved Chang Rongsheng, the son of a manager at the Chang Yun Shipping Company. Both were kidnapped on their way to school and disappeared without a trace. The details of each case are described below.</p>
<p>Sister and Brother Together, Encountered Kidnappers in Distress</p>
<p>Wang Zhixin, currently the general manager of the New China Bank in Shanghai, resides at No. 63 Jufou Road in the French Concession. His youngest son, Renzhong, is only nine years old and attends the affiliated primary school of Nanyang Model Middle School on Yaozhu Road. At 7:05 yesterday morning, he was accompanied by his older sister to school. As they were walking to the intersection of Jufou Road and Beidang Road, two kidnappers, one armed with a firearm, were lying in wait by the roadside. A Tailai automobile, license number 12056, was parked nearby. Seeing Renzhong approaching, the armed kidnapper ordered them to stop. The unarmed kidnapper rushed forward, grabbed Renzhong, and put him into the car. His sister, although witnessing everything, was helpless. The kidnappers, having achieved their goal, threatened the driver, Gong Guichun, to drive quickly eastward, turning to the desolate area west of No. 246 Yaozhu Road. They forced Gong to carry Renzhong into Tianyou Lane, followed by the two kidnappers. As they passed the East Asia Institute run by the Japanese at the intersection of Haig Road and Hongqiao Road, two more kidnappers arrived to receive the young hostage, ordering Gong to leave. They disappeared without a trace. Subsequently, Gong Guichun and Wang's family reported the incident to the French police, who immediately dispatched a large number of detectives and patrol cars to surround Tianyou Lane. They searched each residence in the alley, but found nothing. The police are currently investigating the case.</p>
<p>Cuffed the Driver, Carried into the Car</p>
<p>Chang Xiufeng, a native of Haizhou who works as a manager at the Duan Yun Shipping Company at No. 123 Guangdong Road, rents a residence at No. 9, Lane 443, Pei Kai'er Road, Yangshupu. His son, Rongsheng, is only ten years old and attends a certain primary school on Jingzhou Road. At around 8 a.m. yesterday morning, he was riding in a chartered car driven by Zheng Qingxi (a native of Haimen) when three kidnappers suddenly appeared at the intersection of Pei Kai'er Road and Taopeng Road. One of them was wearing a uniform, a military cap, and a mask, resembling a foreigner. They stopped the car, brandishing a pistol and forbidding any noise. They first handcuffed the driver, Zheng Qingxi, to the car's lever, then forcibly dragged the young hostage out of the car and pushed him into a car parked by the roadside, which then sped off northward. Afterward, Zheng Qingxi ran back to the residence and reported the kidnapping of the young master. The family immediately reported the incident to the Yulin Road police station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign police officers to the scene to investigate and search the area.</p>

<p>New Year's Charity Race Meeting</p>
<p>Three Days of Racing from January 2nd</p>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club had originally scheduled to hold its New Year's Race Meeting on January 2nd, 3rd, and 4th, starting at 11:30 a.m. each day. Now, to support the International Sports Association's efforts to raise funds for refugee relief, it has been decided to cooperate with the International Sports Association and transform the above three days of racing into a joint New Year's Charity Race Meeting. All net profits and commissions from the New Year's Charity Sweepstakes tickets, after deducting necessary expenses, will be used for charitable purposes. It is expected that a net profit of 100,000 yuan in national currency will be raised, with 50,000 yuan allocated to the British War Relief Fund and 50,000 yuan allocated to various civilian charities in Shanghai. It is reported that those wishing to request donations can write directly to the Board of Directors of the International Sports Association for distribution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to expand the organization and raise more charitable donations, the New Year's Charity Sweepstakes will be set for 50,000 numbers. All procedures will follow the Shanghai Race Club's spring and autumn season sweepstakes rules, with eleven articles in total. A full ticket costs ten yuan, with each strip costing one yuan. The first prize could be as much as 196,000 yuan. The public is enthusiastic about purchasing them because they provide both the opportunity to win a large prize and the chance to help refugees. It is reported that half of the total number of tickets has already been sold.</p>
<p>Economic Construction Publications and Economic Laws and Regulations Highly Praised</p>

<p>Egypt and Libya: An Aerial View of Ancient and Modern Battlefields</p>
<p>The Mediterranean coast of North Africa has been a battleground for various powers since ancient times. Now, British and Italian troops are engaged in fierce fighting there again.</p>
<p>North Africa is strategically important. Besides being controlled by the Roman Empire, it has historically been ruled by the Greeks, Byzantines, Arabs, and Turks, none of whom fared well in the end.</p>
<p>Until just over fifty years ago, Egypt was plagued by internal strife. British influence began to penetrate, and the British acquisition of rights to the Suez Canal from the Egyptian king was constantly threatened. After joint British-Egyptian rule and vigorous reorganization, this historically significant land became orderly and prosperous.</p>
<p>In 1912, Italy seized Libya from Turkey. Now, armies are re-enacting ancient conflicts in that land, with the only difference being the equipment and tactics used.</p>
<p>In ancient times, Rome, having conquered North Africa, obtained grain supplies from the Cyrenaica coast and the fertile Nile River valley, thus fulfilling its desire to control the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Modern Rome, while establishing agricultural colonies in northern Libya, is gathering troops to invade Egypt and seize the Suez Canal, proclaiming, "The Mediterranean is our sea!"</p>
<p>Modern Egypt is even more prosperous than in the past. The Frenchman Ferdinand de Lesseps carved the Suez Canal out of a desert of yellow sand, providing Egypt with a shortcut to the East. The old land routes followed by camel caravans were abandoned.</p>
<p>Egypt was originally part of the Turkish Empire. From 1914 to 1922, it was under British protection. In 1936, Britain and Egypt signed a treaty stipulating that Britain would no longer occupy Egypt by force, but Egypt had to recognize Britain's right to defend the Suez Canal and use the ports of Alexandria and Port Said as naval bases.</p>
<p>The author traveled along the coast of Libya and Egypt, from the port of Benghazi to the Suez Canal, a battlefield of ancient and modern times. The following is a brief account of the scenery along the way.</p>
<p>The journey began on an Italian civilian plane, flying into Benghazi Airport. Looking down, the legendary "Golden Apple Orchard" was fully visible. Italian immigrants are working hard to develop and prosper the "Golden Apple" orchards.</p>
<p>After the British and Italian forces clashed in North Africa, Benghazi became an important staging point for Italy to transport troops and supplies to North Africa. The land there is fertile, and in recent years, orchards, vineyards, and wheat fields have expanded considerably. The rainfall along the Cyrenaica coast is sufficient for cultivation, without the need for irrigation. Droughts occur on average every five years, and Italian engineers are currently opening artesian wells to prevent them.</p>
<p>On the way to Cyrene, there are many newly opened olive groves, lush and green. Golden wheat grows on a red soil. Farmers stand on threshing machines, gazing into the distance, and plump farm children wave to passers-by from freshly painted farmhouses.</p>
<p>A few miles away, Apollonia is the port of Cyrene. Ships from ports in Greece, Palestine, the Nile Delta, and other Mediterranean ports come to this port to load and unload goods. Ancient celebrities such as Aristippus, the founder of the Cyrenaic school of philosophy, Theodorus the Atheist, Eratosthenes, the geographer who first determined the length of the Earth's meridian and drew a world map, and the poet Callimachus all lived in Cyrene.</p>
<p>Traveling east along the Derna Highlands, there are more newly developed agricultural colonies along the way. Derna Wells provide convenient access to water, and have been the site of many orchards since ancient times, and still are today. The markets are full of grapes. The rural areas produce a lot of wheat, which is shipped to Scotland to make malt, until normal trade was interrupted by the outbreak of the European War.</p>
<p>The abundance of water in Derna is strategically important to the Italian military. Tobruk, located east along the coast, lacks fresh water and must be supplied by ships carrying water from Derna. Derna and Benghazi are the only places along the Cyrenaica coast with a supply of fresh water.</p>
<p>The port of Tobruk has recently been repeatedly bombed by British naval and air forces, so its name is often seen in the news. There are many laborers here who can be used by Italy. There are also ancient ruins nearby, the largest being the city of Antipyrgos, built by the Greeks. After many years, the wind and sand of the Libyan desert have blown over it, leaving only ruins.</p>
<p>Tobruk is a good harbor on the North African coast. The port is home to the Italian army, navy, and air force. The peninsula juts into the sea, forming a bay about two miles long and less than a mile wide. Regardless of the weather, ships can enter.</p>
<p>Libya's most valuable product, besides barley, is sponges from the Mediterranean coast. Since ancient times, Greek fishermen have dived here to collect cup-shaped sponges of excellent quality. From April to November, the sea from the Gulf of Sirte in Libya in the west to the port of Matruh in Egypt in the east is full of sponge-collecting boats.</p>
<p>Tuna fishing is also becoming an important industry. Fishermen on the American Pacific coast extract the oil from tuna, can it, and sell it, making it taste like chicken. The Italians, on the other hand, preserve the full flavor of the fish.</p>
<p>From Tobruk, a branch road runs south through the desert to the grassland of Giarabub, which Egypt ceded to Italy several years ago. The main military highway runs from Tobruk another ninety miles east to the port of Bardia and the Egyptian border.</p>
<p>Looking at the map, the area of Libya is vast, five and a half times larger than Italy itself. But only a limited area is suitable for cultivation: the narrow coastal strip of Cyrenaica and some areas of Tripolitania. Other place names on the map are merely military outposts, a cluster of mud huts, a patch of grass, or a waterhole. The rest is a vast and boundless desert, with rolling dunes and rugged rocks.</p>
<p>Egypt also occupies a large area of North Africa, and the situation is similar to Libya. People often say, "Egypt is the Nile, and the Nile is Egypt," which shows that the fertile land is only in the Nile River valley.</p>
<p>The narrow Nile River flows through Egypt, and is now more fertile than in the past. Over the past fifty years, Britain has invested heavily and sent engineers to work with the Egyptian authorities to improve the Nile's water conservancy. The scale of the project is comparable to ancient monuments.</p>
<p>In the past, Egyptians relied on the annual flooding of the Nile to grow crops and make a living. But this is no longer the case. Dams and sluices have been built on the river to control the water, so crops can be harvested one or two or three times a year. Egyptian cotton production often affects world cotton prices. Engineers are developing new plans every year, gradually turning the edge of the desert into agricultural areas. But on the whole, the arable area of Egypt is still very small, only one twenty-eighth of the entire country.</p>
<p>The Libyan desert ends to the west of the Nile. To the east is the Arabian Desert, stretching to Suez and the Red Sea. The desert is only broken by grasslands, the small huts of tribal people, and the routes taken by camel caravans. Occasionally, there is a cluster of mud huts next to a well, providing convenience for travelers. Sidi Barrani, sixty miles from the Libyan border, is such a place.</p>
<p>Continuing east along the Egyptian coast, one reaches the port of Marsa Matruh. The port is simply a heavily fortified military camp, with a large British garrison, a sea route, and a railway linking it to Alexandria.</p>
<p>Two thousand years ago, the Egyptian queen Cleopatra transformed Marsa Matruh into a summer resort, and she and her favorite, Antony, watched the waves of the Mediterranean crashing against the shore. Now, the area where soldiers swim on the beach of Marsa Matruh still bears the name "Cleopatra's Bath."</p>
<p>Marsa Matruh has often been visited by important figures. In 331 BC, Alexander the Great passed through on his way to Siwa, a famous oasis in the desert. At that time, Alexander the Great led his army from Macedonia on a long expedition, winning every battle. He had already passed through Asia Minor, defeated the Persian army at Issus, besieged Tyre, capturing it after seven months. He then conquered Palestine and Egypt, establishing the port of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Siwa is about two hundred miles southwest of Marsa Matruh, along a route that is entirely desert hills, with only a few wells scattered along the way. The oasis's oracle was famous as early as the sixth century BC, far surpassing the Oracle of Delphi in Greece. Before and after Alexander the Great, many emperors and dignitaries who could not resolve personal or national affairs would seek the oracle at the Temple of Jupiter-Amun in Siwa. The temple still exists, and travelers are always coming and going.</p>
<p>Siwa is sixty feet below sea level and produces dates, pomegranates, lemons, olives, and vegetables. During the harvest season, camel caravans line up to buy sweet fresh fruit. Siwa is surrounded by hills, and villagers mostly build houses in the valleys to live in, while others carve rooms out of the rocks in the hills or build mud huts on the hills to live in. The villagers' lives and languages are unaffected by outside influences.</p>
<p>The port of Alexandria, built when Macedonia conquered Egypt, is the most enduring monument. The city has a bustling coastal market ten miles long, with thriving commerce and well-organized buildings. Looking down from above, the houses are densely packed, with only the park area being open space. Ships are crowded in the port, and thick smoke rises and dissipates in the railway yards.</p>
<p>Along the coast of Alexandria stands the Pharos of Alexandria (one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World). Today, the coastline is filled with searchlights, which sweep across the sky at night, searching for traces of the enemy. Four hundred years ago, after Portuguese navigator Vasco da Gama and others discovered the sea route to India around the Cape of Good Hope, Alexandria's trade plummeted. It was not until the Suez Canal was built and Egyptian cotton flourished that the city's commerce revived.</p>
<p>Not far to the east is the village of Rosetta at the mouth of the Nile's western branch, known for its stones and melons. Halfway to Rosetta, one passes Abu Qir along the coast, where fishermen use nets that are miles long. Over a hundred years ago, French King Napoleon led an invasion fleet of seventeen warships. British General Nelson, who guarded the Nile, sent warships to meet them. A great battle took place off the coast of Abu Qir, destroying thirteen of Napoleon's warships in one battle.</p>
<p>If one takes an EgyptAir flight from Alexandria to Port Said and Cairo, one can enjoy a panoramic view of the fertile area of the Nile Delta. Farmland is visible everywhere along the river, and the desert begins at the end of the river. The dam at the point where the Nile splits fifteen miles north of Cairo was built in 1833 from stones removed from the base of the Pyramid of Giza. The project was enormous, but it was not completed at the time because it cost too much. It was not until 1891 that it was fully completed under the direction of British engineers.</p>
<p>Flying south to Cairo, one can see countless circular objects on the ground, which are difficult to identify. Only after landing does one realize that they are the traditional threshing floors.</p>
<p>Travelers imagine Cairo to be a large city full of ancient charm, but they do not expect to see modern buildings, cars, and streetcars, bustling back and forth. Young women do not wear veils, and street vendors sell ice-cold drinks. Everything is a scene of a modern city. If one enters the Arabian district, one can still see narrow streets, old fortress-like buildings, native markets, and merchants chatting and doing small business among camel herds, almost making one forget that one is living in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>There is a road leading directly from Cairo to Giza on the other side of the Nile. There are the famous Sphinx and pyramids, but along the way is a modern residential area. At night, modern popular songs are played in hotels and clubs, and young Egyptian men and women dance. To protect against air raids, the Cairo Museum has moved its valuable items and the remains of former Egyptian kings back to the tombs for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Traveling up the Nile, one can see pyramids, ancient temples, and the remains of ancient cities everywhere. On the stone tombs in the area of Beni Hasan are engraved paintings of ancient Egyptian life, such as hunting, dancing, wrestling, farming, and even gambling. Further south along the river, many sluices have already been completed, and new ones are still being built. The canals on both sides are constantly being widened to irrigate cotton and sugarcane fields. Today, Egypt has made great progress under the development of British and Egyptian industries.</p>
<p>If one takes a flight from Cairo to Port Said, one can fly over the ancient city of Tanis. In February of this year, the Egyptian scholar, the Frenchman Montet, discovered the tomb of the second king of the Twenty-First Dynasty, Psusennes I, in this city. The tomb contained a great deal of gold, silver, and jewels.</p>
<p>Port Said is located at the mouth of the Suez Canal. On the seawall stands a statue of Ferdinand de Lesseps, the French engineer who devoted his life to building the canal, with one hand pointing directly at the canal. The statue is engraved with the words: "Open to all the world."</p>
<p>The Suez Canal is a hundred miles long, cutting through the desert, Lake Timsah, and the Great Bitter Lake, and reaching the Red Sea at Suez. It is a shortcut for Europe to reach East Africa, India, and the ports of the Far East. It has been gradually dredged, the riverbed is becoming deeper, and the banks are becoming wider so that large ships can pass through. Today, all but the largest ships can pass through easily. Normally, 6,000 ships pass through the canal each year. The canal can be said to be the lifeline of the British Empire.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly Confucius' Two Jewels By Zhang Yilei</p>
<p>—Loyalty and Forgiveness—</p>
<p>When I was a child studying in a private school, every time we went to school and left school, the teacher would ask us to bow to a portrait of an old man with a white beard hanging on the wall. We didn't understand the reason for bowing, so the teacher explained that he was called Confucius and was a great sage, and we should respect him... Then he told many stories about Confucius, but because we were too young at that time, we still didn't understand what he said. However, we had to obey the teacher's words, so we bowed to the portrait every day when we went to school and left school without understanding why.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I was about to graduate from elementary school, after being enlightened by many teachers, that I gradually understood Confucius. I realized that his character was good, his knowledge was extensive, his life was very simple, and he was kind and approachable in his interactions with others. He also often taught his students the principles of "loyalty" (which means doing things with all your heart) and "forgiveness" (which means being considerate of others).</p>
<p>Now, I am already a big child, and my knowledge is naturally much higher than before. In addition, my thoughts have been impacted by the "tides of the times," and I have gradually realized that we should give a "new" interpretation to Confucius' character and knowledge. Everyone should not only strive to learn from Confucius' good moral behavior in the spirit of the times, so as to cultivate themselves into sound and exemplary citizens, but also carry forward his principles of "loyalty" and "forgiveness." For example, Confucius said that "loyalty" means doing things with all your heart, and we should expand it to mean doing our best to be loyal to the country and society. As for "forgiveness," we should naturally forgive those who are willing to correct their mistakes, and we should also strive to win them over and encourage them to become useful people. But for those who have lost their souls, we should not only not forgive them, but also attack them, destroy them, and eradicate them completely. Only in this way can we truly understand Confucius' principles of "loyalty" and "forgiveness."</p>
<p>Why Winter Is Cold By Jin Zhen</p>
<p>The wind in the past few days has been blowing from the northwest, making people shiver as if it were piercingly cold, especially in the morning and evening.</p>
<p>"Why is the weather so much colder these days than it was a few days ago?" Ah Hui asked Ah Ming, who was washing his face, as he got out of his warm bed.</p>
<p>"That's because the winter solstice has arrived, and the weather is naturally very cold."</p>
<p>"Then why does it get cold in winter?" Ah Hui kept asking.</p>
<p>"The temperature, whether hot or cold, is most closely related to sunlight and wind direction. In winter, the sun is in the south, and our country is in the northern part of the earth, so the amount of sunlight we receive is naturally much weaker than in summer, and the daytime is very short, while the night is long. Therefore, the ground receives little solar heat, and the weather is cold. Moreover, the wind in winter often blows from the northwest, but the climate in the northwest is even colder than it is here, so the wind blowing from there is also very cold, and the weather here becomes cold."</p>
<p>"Why is the sun in the south in winter, brother? Can you tell me?"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll do an experiment for you, and you'll understand." After saying this, Ah Ming went to find a ball, a candle, and a piece of chalk. First, he wrote a white line in the center of the ball to represent the Earth's equator. Then he dragged Ah Hui into a dark room and pulled down the curtains, making the room even darker. He drew an oval shape on a table and placed a candle in the center of the oval, lighting it to represent sunlight. Then he placed the ball on the white line, making sure that the sunlight could shine on the ball, and the ball kept moving along the white line. Ah Ming began to say: "The ball's rotation is called the Earth's rotation, and one rotation is one day. The ball's movement along the white line is called the Earth's revolution, and one revolution takes 365 days." He made the white line on the ball not parallel to the white line on the table, because the Earth's axis is tilted. First, he made the sunlight shine on the equator (the white line in the center of the ball), and then he kept rotating the ball, only to see the sunlight gradually moving to the south of the equator, farther away from the northern temperate zone, and there were more dark places and fewer bright places in the northern hemisphere. Ah Ming then said: "This is in winter, when the sunlight shines in the south, and less of the north is illuminated, so the north is in winter, and the climate feels very cold, and the time that the sunlight shines is also short. Therefore, winter is short days and long nights, and the winter solstice is the day with the shortest daylight hours of the year. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>"Then I understand. I still want to ask you: Why are there more north winds and northwest winds in winter?"</p>
<p>"That's because the temperature here is very high, the air is thin and rises, and the dense cold air in the north flows to replenish it, so there are more northwest winds in winter."</p>
<p>Recalling a Memorable Christmas By Wan Wen</p>
<p>Tiger Mountain in front of the village was obscured by double illusory clouds, appearing and disappearing intermittently, and the lush pine forest became increasingly blurred. The weather suddenly turned cold, and a misty drizzle began to fall. By evening, snowflakes were flying everywhere. In a tile-roofed house in a small village at the foot of the mountain, a group of refugee children stood, facing Tiger Mountain, silently watching the huge snowflakes, without saying a word. The joy and excitement of the past had disappeared. In each person's small heart, they were recalling the scene of snowfall in their hometown. They thought that the snowy scene was a sign that a happy Christmas was coming. Although there was no calendar to consult here, it seemed that Christmas was already in sight, given the climate and weather. In Jianqing's father's diary, it was indeed written that today was December 24th. When they thought of this day, they felt it came too suddenly and was too out of place. They often heard their parents say, "We have been refugees for a year and four months." Counting the days, they have been living in Guyi, which is more than a thousand miles away from their hometown, for three months. Why can't they go back yet? Why can't Christmas wait for them to go back and celebrate? Now everything is empty. Tomorrow is Christmas, but where is the glittering Christmas tree? Where is the kind and amiable Santa Claus? Where are the beautiful cards, delicious sweets, and interesting toys? Everything has disappeared. They couldn't think about it any longer and went back to their homes, dejected, treading through the snow. Jianqing ate dinner and went to bed early. After a while, he entered a sweet dream, dreaming that he was wearing new clothes, at a grand celebration, playing, eating, and singing with his friends. He also dreamed that Santa Claus came on a sleigh from a very far place and filled the socks he had hung with many sweets, toys, and cards. He jumped and cheered happily, but was suddenly awakened by a strong light. Nothing was there. The room was still the same, with several beds standing there alone. His younger siblings had already gotten up and were playing in the snow outside. He couldn't help but feel disappointed, but when he was making his bed, he found a red paper-wrapped gift, with the words "To My Son Jianqing" written on it. He recognized the handwriting and knew it was a gift from his mother. So he quickly tore off the wrapping paper, revealing a collection of stories about famous people. On the first page of the book, there were many words written: "My dear child,</p>
<h3>Eastern Hotel Entrance - A Bloodshed Occurred Yesterday Morning: Hua Yunjie Shot in a Vital Area, Life in Danger; Feng Zhiming and Wife Shot Themselves in the Great Western Road</h3>
<p>At the entrance of the New Eastern Hotel at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Beihai Road, at approximately 9:50 AM yesterday morning, a shooting incident suddenly occurred. The victim was Hua Yunjie, who held a position in Jiangning. He was shot in the waist on the spot and collapsed to the ground. The shooter took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Bullet Penetrated Chest - Collapsed on the Spot</p>
<p>Hua Yunjie was from Wuxi, 43 years old. He opened the Five Dragons Near Water Stage Teahouse at the intersection of Nicheng Bridge and Xinzha Road and was a student of Chang Yuqing. He currently holds an important position in Nanjing. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Yesterday morning, at approximately 9:50 AM, Hua, wearing a grey robe, a black overcoat, yellow leather shoes, and a coffee-colored felt hat, had just exited room 314 of the Eastern Hotel and reached the entrance. Suddenly, a person, noticing Hua leaving, immediately drew a gun and fired two shots. One bullet hit his right waist and penetrated his chest. He collapsed into a pool of blood on the spot.</p>
<p>Detectives Investigated - Already Gone Without a Trace</p>
<p>When the gunshots rang out, Zheng Ping, the clerk of the hotel at number 1536, who happened to be sipping tea inside, heard the shots and knew something was wrong. He quickly rushed out to investigate and saw a well-dressed man lying on the ground, realizing he had been assassinated. He searched the surrounding area for the shooter but found nothing. He immediately reported to a certain detective office stationed on Racecourse Road and telephoned the Old Zha station to dispatch Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They recovered a shell casing and quickly summoned an ambulance, accompanied by Detective Bao number 98, to Renji Hospital for treatment. Although doctors performed surgery, his life was still in danger.</p>
<p>Visiting a Friend Without Success - Trouble Arising from Within</p>
<p>When Hua fell to the ground after being injured, he kept repeating that he came from room 314, not knowing what he meant. When reporters investigated on the third floor afterward, it was learned that the registration book for room 314 showed Shen Fuqing, 34 years old, from Suzhou, a doctor. He had paid ten yuan for the room when he opened it the day before yesterday. The waiter in the hall told people that the room was already empty. The injured person was a friend of the room occupant. Before the incident, it was not noticed whether he had walked out of the room. However, Hua later told people that he had just gone to the room to visit his friend surnamed Shen, but he was already out. He then went downstairs to return home and unexpectedly encountered misfortune.</p>
<p>Feng Zhiming and Wife Shot Simultaneously</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, around 5:00 AM, Feng Zhiming (26 years old, a local resident, residing in Yinxiang Port, Yangshupu) and his wife, Feng Li (22 years old), were walking out of a certain building near Columbia Road on the Great Western Road in western Shanghai. The couple was walking leisurely when, after a few steps, in front of a wasteland, four men suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. Two men stepped forward and, without asking any questions, drew handguns and fired at Feng. Feng was hit in the head by a bullet and immediately collapsed in a pool of blood. Feng's wife, seeing this, screamed in horror and was then shot in the chest, collapsing to the ground injured. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the four men fled together without a trace. Subsequently, the Public Concession police received the news and quickly dispatched an ambulance to transport the Feng couple to the Second Tongren Hospital for treatment. It was reported that their injuries were extremely serious. According to news from the Pingming Society, the target of the assassination was Hong Zijun, who currently works for the "Peace and National Salvation Army."</p>
<h3>Sailors Fighting Each Other - Italian Statement - Denies Anyone Died</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that regarding the incident of American and Italian soldiers fighting each other in a Shanghai ballroom before Christmas, the Italian authorities in the city issued a public statement today (28th), denying that anyone died as a result of the fight. According to the statement, only on Wednesday did Italian military officers visit the headquarters of the U.S. Marine Corps Fourth Regiment to inquire about the injuries of those involved in the fight. Both American and Italian authorities believe that this unfortunate incident has been completely resolved and believe that the extremely harmonious and friendly relationship between the officers and soldiers of the two countries will not be affected by this incident.</p>
<h3>President Liner World Class - Six Ships Renamed - Original Names of Each Ship Transferred to New Ships for Use</h3>
<p>According to news from the American President Lines, the company's newly built World Class giant ships number seven. The names of six of these ships are the same as the names of the six old ships currently circumnavigating the world. Therefore, the names of these six old ships must be changed to avoid repetition. The ship name changes are as follows: (1) President Hayes changed to President Taylor, (2) President Polk changed to President Tyler, (3) President Garfield changed to President Madison, (4) President Monroe changed to President Buchanan, (5) President Adams changed to President Grant, (6) President Van Buren changed to President Fillmore.</p>
<h3>Speculation in Foreign Exchange - Already Showing Caution</h3>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee maintains the legal foreign exchange and stabilizes the Shanghai black market. This is carried out according to the established policy of the government. After temporarily suspending the maintenance of the black market exchange rate on May 2nd, a large amount of foreign exchange was purchased to replenish the fund. The previous temporary suspension of maintaining the black market was because the market situation was too adverse, and it was immediately restored. For example, last Monday, because a certain bank was about to issue miscellaneous banknotes, the market's buying of foreign exchange became even more intense, and the black market exchange rate tightened. Fortunately, the committee supplied as much as possible from Hong Kong by telegraph, which stabilized the situation. Moreover, in Shanghai's foreign exchange black market transactions, there are very few legitimate transactions by legal merchants, and most are speculative. The main reason is that there is too much floating capital in Shanghai. There are also many foreigners who speculate in foreign exchange. Speculators spread rumors at any time to make profits. Since the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee maintained the market, speculators have been cautious. Now the government's continued maintenance of the Shanghai black market has deeply won the admiration of Chinese and foreigners. All measures are considered to be the wise actions of the Chinese government. The foreign exchange black market is not a true and fair market price. The exchange rate of Chinese currency to foreign currencies, such as the Central Bank's listed exchange rates for British and American exchanges, remains the same as before. The changes in Shanghai's exchange rate are not related to the overall legal exchange rate.</p>
<h3>Principal and Interest of Consolidated Bonds Paid as Scheduled - Over Five Thousand US Dollars - Payments Will Not Be Stopped Due to Customs Duties Being Intercepted - Faith in All Quarters Deepens, Prices Soar</h3>
<p>In order to uphold credit, the Ministry of Finance has instructed the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Central Trust of China to discount and pay for domestic debts secured by customs duties, and has ordered the National Debt Fund Management Committee to carry out the drawing of lots for principal repayment, and will not stop payments due to the interception of customs duties in occupied areas.</p>
<p>Payment Methods</p>
<p>The tenth principal repayment of the 25th Year of the Republic Consolidated Bonds; the winning numbers for the A, B, C, D, and E bond types have all been drawn. The Central Bank has been instructed to start repaying principal and paying interest from January 31st. All bondholders may apply to the Central Bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications for discount and payment of winning bonds and matured interest coupons.</p>
<p>Principal and Interest Amounts</p>
<p>For this principal repayment and interest payment, the principal for Type A is 4.2 million yuan, and the interest is 3.915 million yuan. The principal for Type B is 1.95 million yuan, and the interest is 4.2255 million yuan. The principal for Type C is 2.8 million yuan, and the interest is 10.011 million yuan. The principal for Type D is 4.4 million yuan, and the interest is 15.609 million yuan. The principal for Type E is 2.08 million yuan, and the interest is 7.5036 million yuan.</p>
<p>Reconstruction Bonds</p>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee will execute the tenth principal repayment drawing of the 25th Year of the Republic Reconstruction Bonds in Shanghai on January 10th. From February 28th, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Central Trust of China will discount and pay for the bonds, totaling 1.7 million yuan in principal and 9.741 million yuan in interest. The government's measures have gained the trust of bondholders. The prices of various unified bonds on the Shanghai stock exchange have soared.</p>
<h3>Fan Keling Talks - Future of the Shanghai Concession - Japan Will Not Seize the Concession During a Japanese-American War - Anglo-American Loans to China Benefit Shanghai Commerce</h3>
<p>Mr. Fan Keling, the former Director-General of the Public Concession, has been engaged in legal work since he resigned this April. He left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the President Jackson on the 13th of this month. As the Director-General of the Municipal Council, he is extremely familiar with the international situation and has a clear understanding of the situation in Shanghai. During his tenure, he made careful plans and put in a lot of effort. According to sources from the foreign community in the city, he made a lengthy statement to reporters upon arriving in Hong Kong, stating that if the United States goes to war with Japan, he does not believe that Japan will seize the concession. The neutrality of the Public Concession is of great benefit to Japan, as Japan uses this as one of its last means of acquiring foreign exchange. Mr. Fan continued, "I am not evacuating my wife and family from Shanghai at this time because I don't think it is necessary at this time. I think that the State Department's evacuation order applies to those who are nervous or have no commercial affairs. But if you want to continue to stay, there is no need to leave. If war breaks out, I don't think we will be affected. If my guess is wrong, at most it will be a concentration camp. I also think that if that is the case, it will not harm our health." Regarding the situation in the Far East, Mr. Fan said that he firmly believes that the tough stance recently shown by the United States will not be intimidated. Although Shanghai is blockaded and traffic to the interior of China is cut off, making trade difficult, the recent British and American loans to China have brought new activity to Shanghai commerce. Observing the recent efforts of the Japanese to prepare for the next Municipal Council election, demanding to amend the land regulations, municipal election law, financial system, and donation tax system, and proclaiming that they will take back the Public Concession, Mr. Fan Keling's speech is a powerful response. Mr. Fan stayed in Hong Kong for ten days and then returned north.</p>
<h3>British Airways and Imperial Airways - Combined Operations</h3>
<p>When British Airways and Imperial Airways merged this April, they issued an announcement stating that Imperial Airways' Far East Branch would also be merged into the new organization. It is understood that this merger will be realized in the near future. Imperial Airways has prepared the merger procedures and will be renamed British Overseas Airways Corporation in the future. According to Mr. Meisili, manager of the company, the company's staff and office address will not be changed.</p>

<h3>"Raider" Discovered in the Indian Ocean - More Than Twenty Norwegian Ships Have Been Sunk - British Ship Crews Have Received Wartime Allowances</h3>
<p>According to the English "Great American Daily," a visitor from South China said this morning (28th) that crew members of ships traveling between Hong Kong and India have now received "wartime allowances" because of the increasing frequency with which a raider (ship name unknown) in the Indian Ocean intercepts British ships. More than twenty Norwegian ships have also been sunk.</p>
<p>Norwegian Ship Attacked</p>
<p>Approximately seventy survivors were rescued after the ship was shelled and sunk, including seventeen women and children. They were rescued by a Japanese cargo ship and taken to Hong Kong, and are now returning to Norway via Siberia. However, the British authorities in Hong Kong have secretly announced the news of the attack on British and Norwegian ships and do not recognize that crew members are entitled to wartime allowances. The visitor also said that when he stayed in Vietnam, he saw that the Japanese had almost completely controlled everything. The conflict between Thailand and Vietnam was caused by the natural feelings of Vietnamese natives seeking freedom and status, as most natives cannot obtain important positions.</p>
<p>Italian Ship's Chinese Staff and Passengers</p>
<h3>Released Last Night - But Prohibited from Sailing to Zhejiang Sea - Kaiming Comprador Still Not Released</h3>
<p>The Maberilia, an Italian ship of the Rochi Shipping Company, cleared customs in Shanghai and sailed to Haikou at the beginning of this month. It was inspected by the Japanese Navy en route and forced to return to Shanghai after discovering letters destined for Wenzhou on board. One Chinese comprador and two Wenzhou passengers were detained for nearly a month. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency, after repeated negotiations between the Italian Consulate in Shanghai and the Japanese side, the three detained Chinese were released on the evening of the 27th. However, the Japanese side prohibited the ship from sailing to ports in Zhejiang Province. The ship has now been forced to stop exporting. The incident in which the Chinese comprador of the British Kaiming Mailer was detained by the Japanese on the 24th of this month has not yet been resolved.</p>
<h3>Another Japanese Man Cut in Nanshi</h3>
<p>According to reports, at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, a Japanese man was passing through the intersection of Zhonghua Road and Penglai Road in Nanshi when he was cut several times with a sharp blade. The Japanese man was seriously injured at the time and moaned on the side of the road. He was discovered by someone who reported to the "police." Soon, the Italian troop detachment in Nanshi received the news and dispatched a team to search nearby, but found nothing. One account says that the injured Japanese man was a soldier.</p>
