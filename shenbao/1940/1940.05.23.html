<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c12">日本能學步德國麽？ <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>日本維新已數十年了，以蕞爾島國驟儕於世界一等强國之列，是近代史上一大奇蹟。然而這一成就，在歷史上既缺乏深厚的根基，其本身又未經歷澈底的興革，縱然在表面看來未嘗不光輝燦爛，內裏却包孕着無數矛盾和缺陷。其間尤其値得注意的，是什文化和學術一方面：舊有的是一切都蹈襲自中國，新興德則亦步亦趨的學習着西方；其間除却模倣和闡揚而外，幾絕無創造之可言，因之也就不能進而形成一個獨立的文化系統。這正是有關日本立國根本的嚴重問題，絕非一時的繁榮强盛所能掩飾的。</p>
<p>上述情形在日本侵華軍事方面可以找釗無數例證。據說最近日軍在豫鄂邊境的會戰，曾經使用大量坦克車鐵甲戰車飛機等武器猛烈進犯，即意在倣效德國在西歐戰事所運用的閃電戰略。德軍此種戰略，就其終極目標而言，爲得爲失，尚非今日所能斷定：而就戰略戰術本身來看，則誠爲軍事技術上一大變革，値得全世界的軍事人材去低首學步，把前此那些腐舊戰術理論重加檢討。日軍當局之驟加模倣，似乎水嘗不是得風氣之先。作窮極必變的打算；然而這種學步有沒有成功的可能呢？</p>
<p>所謂閃電戰術，不外結集大量機械部隊和銳利武器，乘敵不備以迅速猛烈進攻。此種運用，其器材和生命的消耗必倍蓰於普通軍事上的進攻；所以軍器彈藥的儲備補充，必須豐厚迅速，部隊士氣，必須勇往發揚，纔能以壓倒的優勢收迅雷閃電之效。其應用的塲合，也必須是利於速戰速決，準備於最短期間完成一個特定目標。德國最近此項戰略之屢獲成功，一由於其重工業的高度發展，軍事器材有大量生產及供備；其决由於在納粹嚴密統制及理論催眠之下，人民早已具備了戰爭機器的條件；日爾曼民族的抱負，凡爾賽條的的詬辱。咸視此一戰事爲宣洩途徑；復次則有如對波蘭丹麥挪威比荷以及侵法諸役，都具備着一個單純而明確的作戰目標，因之乃得收穫預期效果於一時。假使此後戰事拖延，前綫膠着，敵對的形勢由單純而漸趨繁複，則其功效必當逐次削弱。世人徒震驚於閃電戰術的煊赫戰績，而不去追求其所以成功的條件，這是一種錯誤。</p>
<p>目前日軍的一切情形，恰好都是德軍的反面，士氣早已衰頹，國力亦蝕損殆盡，銳利的武器雖是日方用以制勝的唯一憑藉，在數量上自絕不足以比擬德國，且禁不起大暈的消耗。此而以閃電戰略爲嘗試，徒見其不知量力，自速覆敗，此次豫鄂戰役的經過已提供了明顯的例證。尤其是中日戰爭到現階段，已發展爲平面戰。運動戰，持久戰，絕不適於閃電戰略的應用，並且也沒有可以被日軍視爲有類心臟的突擊對象。退一步講，即使此次鄂北日軍倖而獲逞，充其量也不過是擴大了武漢據點的外圍，並無關於全局戰事的勝敗。何况德國閃電戰略所運用的傘隊和第五縱隊，日方毫不具備；傘隊的訓練在日本根本沒有，以目前日本兵民的厭戰情緒，此種戰術的運用殆屬不可能；至於日方的第五縱隊，祗能寄生於淪陷區域，作威作福，却絲毫影響不到中國的大後方。縱觀中日戰役經過，只有京滬一役比較適於閃電戰略的運用；然而那時期的日方參謀人材既未能先德國而有所發明，其兵力又是從最初的一兩萬人逐次補充到最後的二十萬人，恰好和閃電戰略的用兵相違反。在上海方力百里之內，相持竟達三個月之久，已替中國抗戰的勝利奠定了最初的基礎，在日軍則失掉了速戰速決的時機，以後即使模倣德國戰略維妙維肖，亦將無所施其技倆。</p>
<p>日本戰略戰術之模倣德國，原不自今日而然，普奧普法兩役的經騐，在日本一向是當作作戰理論範本看待的。自太山岩從德國把「色富」戰略帶回東方，山縣有朋又在平壤一役親自導演一次包圍殲滅戰術獲得成就之後，「色當」以及繼之而起的「坦能堡」就成了日本軍人心目中的戰略典型。然而只有蹈襲，而不能適應環境去變化，却使這些軍事慕僚遭受嚴重打擊；三年　的中日戰爭，日軍念茲在茲的色當」一坦能堡二次都小曾獲逞，反而自身一再形成被包圍殲滅的對象；其原因固然是多方面的，無疑其只知一味模倣是主要的弱點。</p>
<p>如果聰明的話，看到德國軍事上最近的成就，霞關的首腦們應該廢然知返了！邯鄲學步，畫虎不成，不惟惹人訕笑，結局也只有目食失敗更慘的後果。日方不乏明達之士，當能從此一敎訓，認識到日本自身的嚴重問題；所惜乎理智在日本，還沒有到抬頭的機連。</p>

<p>（診所）　北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓　（時間）　上午十時至下午六時　星期日休息　做丈夫的門檻　如何使你的妻子永恆地愛你？……</p>
<p>我們知道一個健美而聰明的妻子，她對於丈夫唯一的希望是什麽？無疑的她希望丈夫能給予以最眞實而充分的愛情。換句話說：也就是佔領全身心的靈肉一致的愛情。誠然，一個精力豐足體格健壯的男子，來用着他熱烈的愛情向妻子求愛時，他的妻子是沒有不由衷地歡迎的！於是夫婦生活繾　而甜蜜着，使她芳心如醉，情腸歡暢，感到丈夫的可貴，人生的樂趣，男子若能常保其精力的健壯，使夫婦生活常能美滿，那他的妻子也一定會永恒地愛着她心愛的丈夫，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，人生是何等的幸福！</p>
<p>可是做丈夫的若毫無門檻，不謀其精力的增進。或更曾犯自凟遺精，荒淫縱慾，虧損了生殖腺內分泌液，則精力勢必衰退，而有腎虧，陽痿，發育不全，精薄不育，未老先衰等症象，則雖有美眷如花，亦如何能消受美人的恩情。或竟完全不能人道，愧對其妻！此種丈夫若不速謀補救其缺陷，那妻子怎能長此犧牲，蹉跎靑春？故由此憂鬱成疾，患貧血，經亂，不感不娠，乳　顏衰等症者有之；或因性的趨迫與人私通私奔者亦有之；或竟振振有詞與夫對簿公庭，大興離婚之訟者，在今日社會中亦是司空見慣的事，這時的爲丈夫者多麼的悽慘！</p>
<p>然爲丈夫者欲謀增强其精力，治愈其暗疾，在今日醫學昌明的時代已並非難事了。祗須積極服以健壯動物生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』則男子於服後一日夜間卽可生精補腎，健腦活血，尤貴不斷連服，則更助長發育，滋養神經，濃稠精血，必於短期內根治各症，使精力格外豐足。愛情得到永恒的美滿。中老年人常服，更可延年益壽，返老還童。惟有遺精者須兼服『希米脫氏固精片』以固精關，制止遺洩，收效必尤爲迅速。上項良藥，均經中外名醫化騐證明，確認爲强精補腎之唯一聖劑。所以早已風行全球，譽滿天下，卽本埠中西五洲等大藥房亦均有出售，因其品質之名貴，功效的確實，余曾以此劑治愈患者亦不下數萬人矣。故負責爲之介紹。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>妙齡年華俏女郎，</p>
<p>雪膚花貌玉樣妝，</p>
<p>最是勾人魂魄處，</p>
<p>一抖一聳兩胸膛。</p>
<p>女性身上最最惹人注意而勾人魂魄的東西，莫過於胸前的一對乳峯了，你瞧：這幾天天氣是漸漸的熱了，一般佔風氣之光的時髦女郎，大都已穿上夏季新裝。質料是那麼薄，肉體是那麽豐　、因爲一幅尺寸修短寬窄的適度，所以她們的全身曲線，便十足的顯露出來。行動時的一　三折，已够你目迷心蕩，怎禁得起她胸前的一對乳峯，便孤高自傲地挺了起來，把衣襟一聳一聳，旣似在向人誇耀，又似在向每一個注目的人打招呼，人非木石，看到這樣健美女郎。怎不要心里熱辣辣，腿里軟洋洋呢？所以此等女郎，在女子須有「健康美」的今日，是佔盡了種種便宜，結果典幸福自然也不可限量！</p>
<p>但話又要說回來了，如過去因東胸自凟，經亂帶多，營養障碍，多產虧弱，致卵巢機能遭遇摧殘，影响新陳代謝作用，而致乳峯萎　，臀部瘦削，曲線喪失者。則縱然敷粉塗脂，錦衣美飾，亦不値時代男子的一盼，結果到處碰壁，其命運必非常悲慘！唯一補救之法，可不必旁求，祗要日服女用『生殖素』三次，每次二片，連服四星期，卽覺胃納增强，百體皆舒，繼續再服三星期，萎　的乳峯，就會隆然高聳，同時臀部亦必日見豐腴，肌肉滑潤，面頰更嬌艷欲滴了。</p>

<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念會</p>
<p>足以葬送靑春幸福，貽誤靑年遠大前途！</p>
<p>一個男子過了春情發動期，遺精的現象雖屬難免，但要是正式息了遺精症，那他的嚴重性是不可忽略的。原來遺精有生理與病理的兩種，生理的遺精因體內精液製造的過嚴，或於數月之內偶有一次的遺精，遺後於次日毫不感覺得倦怠頭昏等異狀。這種現象，醫家稱之謂溢精，以判別其與遺精之不同。若患遺精症，則於一月之內恒二三次或更多之遺洩次數，遺後有倦怠不適之感。靑年一遇有此種現象時，即須及早醫治，如因循失治，則遺洩的次數必日漸加多，或竟至見色即遺，白日亦遺而成漏精症，同時因體內精液之枯耗，凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎虧陽痿，發育不全等症象必相繼爆發，於是求學不進，習業無成，誤了前程！且將爲女性不喜，妻妾所恨，人生幸福喪盡！</p>
<p>遺精並非爲不治之症，患者祗須服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」則當夜卽可收安眠止遺之效。如因遺精已有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以根本培補腦腎精血，必可迅速恢復美滿健康。患者若能親來本診所診治，更可保證治愈。</p>

<p>沈克先君，年卅歲，業銀錢界，婚後有腎虧陽痿症象，間有遺精。因之房事不能美滿，或竟完全不能，此不特自己沒趣，也未免太苦了妻子，曾服市上補品補藥，均鮮效果，近身體益感不支故求診治（上自述）經余鮮察其病狀後，囑其購「生殖素」三打，『希米脫氏固精片』一匣，幷每日用電療注射等醫術，兩月於茲，沈君覺精强力足，症象全愈，夫婦愛情彌深維　矣。</p>

<p>最近默洲戰事達嚴重階段、間接影響遠東局勢、茲美國決以全力維持遠東現狀、以戢止野心者之妄念、據傳美政府鑒於遠東局勢嚴重、已令駐在夏威夷之强大　隊駛往遠東、而歸由　德上將主持、該艦隊包括大小戰艦一百餘　、將配置於新加坡　港及中，沿海一帶、而以新加坡爲根據地、以備應付萬一事變、據本埠某著名大學外籍敎授某君謂、</p>
<p>遠東均勢</p>
<p>在最近時期內、不致瀕於破裂、而此均勢之發展、對於中國絕對有利、同時日本自發動侵華戰事後、已喪失其一等强國之優越地位、泥淖愈陷愈深不克自拔、其國策由自動而成爲被動、徬徨不知所措、故國內輿論羣起責難、大有「日本究竟往何處去」之感、則日本對於遠東均勢之影響、遠不如前顯而易見、據該敎授觀察、影響遠東均勢之</p>
<p>重要因素</p>
<p>有二、（一）中日戰事、（二）美國之態度、（三）蘇聯之遠東政策、此三者關係錯綜複雜、互相牽制、乃得維持太平洋現狀美國爲民主國家、其政策多以民意爲轉移、美國民衆、對於目前進行中之歐洲戰事、同情英法著佔大多數、但即使將來戰事發展、不過贊成借款於英法、况以</p>
<p>現時局勢</p>
<p>而　、太平洋情形之緊張、不亞於歐洲至於其遠東政策、則着重三點（一）美國永不承認以暴力獲得之領土或利益、（二）運用除訴　武力以外之種種方法、壓迫日本就範、維持在華利益、（三）極力支持中國門戶開放美國民衆、尤其是文化界及熟悉遠東情形者、如哈佛大學炎羅倫士敎授、前美國駐華海軍總司令雅露爾及孟綠博士等、均</p>
<p>同情中國</p>
<p>抗戰、主張對日實行經濟制裁、但美國當局仍視爲時機水熟、尚須詳細考慮、至於監視日本行動、則始終不懈、如最近派遣艦隊永駐檀香山、警告日本關於荷蘭東印度現狀之維持是、據該敎授稱、美國當局對於西部海岸及檀香山之防務、亦加以嚴密監視、檀杳山最近曾舉行燈火統制及防空演習、</p>

<p>呑滅自己者　　諸位小朋友，我想你們都看見過荒塲上變把戲的人，呑雞蛋，呑皮球，甚至呑刀呑火。但是，我不相信諸位曾聽見人說過，有人把自己從頭頂到脚尖完全呑食了。若是你們回去的時候，打開舊的傳道　十章十二節看看，「愚昧人的口脣呑滅自己，」便知道世上有運　一種人，聖經認他爲愚昧人，他實在是愚昧人，因爲他要呑滅自己，別人見不着他什麽，只見着他的口，小朋友，你們歡喜人只看見你的口嗎？你們想想看，聖經上指的是那種人？（一）誇大·有的孩子說，「我能跳兩尺高，」有的孩子便大誇其口說「那算什麽？我能跳兩丈高。」女孩子說，「我母親有一件新衣，」誇口的女孩子便說，「那不足道，我母親每日換一件新衣。」這種誇口的人，沒有人聽信，他們只是自說自聽罷了。他們的口唇，呑滅了自己。別人只看見他一張嘴。（二）攻訐。許多小孩子歡喜說人的壞話，人不肯信任他，因爲人明白他們當面說別人的壞話，當了別人的面，必然又要說我的壞括。俗語說得好，「來說是非者，便是是非人。你們不要和這樣的孩子做朋友，不要同他們去上學，或同他們遊玩。他們不仁慈的口唇呑滅了自己，我們不要想念這樣的人，雌則他們有很好的東西，我們一想到他們的嘴唇，便覺討厭。（三）假話。許多孩予喜歡說假括。一個人說了一次假話，給旁人證實了，卽不敢與他來往。嘗聽人說，「是的，我知道某某做人的態度很好，功課也做的不錯，只是他常說假話，他的話我一句不敢相信。」任何眞理，一經他的口便成了灣灣曲曲的是非，無人肯相信是眞理。無人信他，無人尊敬他。一個人因爲自己的口，便得不着他人的羨慕、敬重，和愛護，這是如何可怕的一件事。「愚昧人的口，呑滅自已。」願小朋友們緊記這句話，不要忘記。　　如欲詳細硏究請函郵箱一二二七號自由談	人生解剖室裏談人生  崔景泰　　我懷着半奇半懼的心理，跟着二位在讀醫利的友人到他們校中的解剖實騐室裏去參視了一次。常我猛的睹見那些人屍的片段，總不由自主地驚呆了。我的那種窘態，也引得友人笑了。他們領我到一架像病牀似的牀前，牀上蒙着一塊深黃色的布，包着一段東西，友人說這就是他們正在解剖實騐着的人屍。他把黃布揭去，露出那個已沒有腦蓋的頭顱，連着沒有肢體的已剖開了的胸腹，肺，腸，心……等等內臟都能看見的屍體。友人用手反覆羞那個頭顱，解釋它的構造給我聽，又將心肺等提了出來給我看個明白，又割下一隻眼睛來說：牠的構造眞像一具照相機。像這種已解剖不全的屍體，大約有十四具，都用黃布包着，有一架豎立着整體的人的骷髏，靠牆有一排木架，上面放着很多人屍各部份的片段，浸在大大小小的藥水瓶裏。這些，友人大半都不憚煩瑣地大略解釋給我聽了，使我不得不讚嘆這繁複而又微妙的人體構造，精巧得眞是不可思議。這麼一來，的確使我初進來時的那種疑懼的心理消散了。但是，同時却湧上了一陣人生虛幻的悲哀。於是？我忍不住問友人說：「你們處在道種環境裏，對人生引起一些什麼感想呵？』友人聽我這樣的問話，又都微笑了。　　有一位回答說：「找感到這些人——指屍體，牠們是盡了人生的義務了，或許牠們生前並沒有什麼對人羣的特殊貢獻，但是現在雖然僅是一具沒有生命的屍體，却使我們能獲得多少可貴的醫學智識。所以我僅希望自己，必須要爲活着的人的康健幸福不斷努力，不要在活着的時候，辜負了可貴的生命。另一位接着說：「是的，我相信人生並不是一件偶然的事。死，有時候雖然是能威脅人的生的意志，但也能激勵人去爲人羣服務的精神。所以我時常接近這些解剖了的屍體除了自己　惕自己要盡一點做人的義務，要　　地生活，和求得一些人體構　的醫學智識以外，並沒有什麽特殊的反感。」我却沉默着。　　友人又說我：「你以爲死」是人生的一個答復嗎？這實在是錯誤了。」　　「人不免是一種情感的動物，而習慣的確是容易轉移情感的，你或許誤會我們是很殘忍的，其實正因爲我們在這種環境中處得久了，所以並沒有什麽衝動的情感發生罷了。不過，我以爲你是太柔弱了，希望你要剛强一點，不要容這種無謂的感傷來煩擾你自己。」另個友人接着向我說：似乎是已明白我當時的感想。　　的確，我得着了一種新的生的意識，我點着頭，表示感激這二位友人對我這種懇摯的　惕，解釋。我說：「所謂人生的謎，現在可說是解決了。」　　「人生的問題，並不能在這間屋子裏，如此簡單的解決呵。我們環年輕呢！我們是還需要多多的從實際生活中去體會人生的眞義呢。」友人補充我所說的話。　　眞的，我對於人生的感識太膚淺了，聽了這二位友人對我所說的精惕的話，豁朗之下，不免史有些慚愧！　　在那間生死交饗的屋子裏，過了一小時多，友人又陪我出來，在街上沐着陽光煦風，有趣的散談了片刻，我帶了一種感愧和歡欣的心裏回來。　　那些片段的人屍，友人那幾句精惕的話，組成陳陣的回浪，交旋在我的腦海裏：「我必須剛强地生活下去—」「我必須有意義地生活下去！」筆端  陳錦墀　　祇管走過去，不必逗遛着去採了花朶來保存，因爲一路上，花朶目會繼續開放着。—太戈爾「飛鳥集」　　要光明起來，只要不做黑暗的附着物，爲光明而滅亡，則我們一定有悠久的將來，而是一定光明的將來。—魯迅　　在這樣多的苦痛前面，快樂是可　的。—尼采、却酬）長命富貴？  胡同光作雜感僥倖與慚愧  金川　　我們僥倖偷生苟安的住在這孤島上，沒有遭遇到那慘殺，空襲，姦淫，焚毀，顚沛的一切悲劇，反造成了各種畸形的繁榮，戲院的客滿，菜館的興隆，賭窟舞塲的勃興，衣飾消費的奢華，造成了驚人的人超，這眞是一面是慘死與流離，另一面享樂與荒淫；面是正進行着偉大的工作，另一面在黑暗裏跳樑與偷竊，投機與榨取，這種矛盾的現象，使我們慚愧無地，汗流浹背。　　僥倖而偷生，更應感到慚愧而奮起，這種精神，我們値得效學和激勵的。我記得世說新語上，寫周處傳中有這樣的幾句：「周處感到自己的橫暴而慚愧了，去求二陸，周處說：「欲自修改，　年已蹉跎，終無所成！」陸平原之弟陸淸河答道：「古人　朝聞夕死，况君前途尚有，且人患志之不立，而何憂名之不彰邪？」一處遂改動。這方是英雄的本色。所以光是慚愧是無用的，必須再有奮起的決心。　　僥倖而不死，這是給我們再有奮鬥的機會，認淸了目標，莫彷徨，莫恐懼，終有一天奪回我們的光明！　　在這種僥倖與慚愧之下，分頭努力本位的工作，就是省下了些錢，救救正在顚沛流離中的難胞，也可以减少我們的罪過的。通訊戰事擴大聲中歐洲三都文化　英法提携聲中的倫敦（中）  史弢　　戰禍一蔓延到北歐，這冬眠似的歐洲人戰，便逐漸熱鬧起來，牠對於英國國民物質，精神，兩方面的影響，也止一天深刻一天。從戰事的開始起，誰都覺悟到那是個畏期的戰爭，所以一般國民，對於長期戰的忍耐力和勝利的自信，是絕對必需的，要維持這種精神和信心，正如軍略，外交，經濟等一樣，同是戰爭進行中一件大事。　　國民精神統一　　到戰事爆發的時候爲止，張伯倫前首相始終採取和平政策，所以對於此决大戰的目的，一般國民當然不用說，就是那批動輙批評的思想家們，也是熱烈支持牠的。數年前，在學生層中反戰思想擁有　大勢力，但時至今日，這些學生也跟大衆同一步伐了。　　爲了戰事，英國的國民精神倒已統一了，但是這種國民精神是非建立在史堅固的基礎上不可的，所以英國現在對於靑年少年們的精神工作，是異常努力。前數日敎育部政務次官李裁氏，召集了各地敎育代表，在布來士頓舉行全國靑年委員會，討論今後的敎育方針，他們希望使今後的靑年少年們眞切地理解忠義，寬容，公正的思想，同時在這些思想上培養出一顆顆更深更潔的愛國心。　　灌輸協調意識　　英國敎育部又連絡了無綫電廣播協會，着手利用無綫電實施新的敎育方針。自四月十九日起，每星期五有專對學校的播音。播送的題目是「假使諸位是法國人的話」，介紹法國的風俗，習慣，家庭和孩子們的游戲等等，使學生們對法國有正確的認識，縱使在恢復和平以後，英法還是要維持同盟約關係，那是今日英國的政治路向，所以政府從現時起，就在對未來的主人翁們培植着英法協調的精神　　法國的流行歌曲，戲劇，影片等，在今日之美國是異常風行的，倫敦開演法國電影及戲劇的劇塲，一天多似一天。　　因爲戰事的發生，差不多完全等於停頓清的普通敎育，從今年四月起，又强制地復興了。市民的文化生活也一天天呈着重振的姿態，演說會，各種集會，像平時一般地舉行着，出版界的書價是昂貴了，但新刋的書籍却有增加的傾向，倫敦已從初期的異常狀態中漸漸地恢復平時狀態了。</p>

<p>㳺藝界導演的重要  君祺　　當二年前蓓蒂黛維絲在獲得電影藝術學院金牌獎章之後，會發起一個明是，製片家與導演的大集會。在席問她致詞說：「我以爲這個榮譽的獎章，應該由我的導通威利惠勒先生來承受才對，如果不是先生施展他的奇才，我想我無論如何不會獲得它」。　　這一段說話並不單單是謙虛之詞，這應視爲她個人的意見，——她承認導演的地位要比演員來得重要，或者是一張片子的成功，導演是佔着最重要的地位。因爲在好萊塢的大明星，肯坦白地，公開崇敬一個導演，這件事還是前所未見的。大多數的明星，都相信他們要比導演來得偉大，除非在他們表演失敗時，方才提起導演的名字，而往往推託這些都不過是導演的錯誤。　　至於就觀衆的地位來觀察呢，他們大都覺得演員較爲重要，這是無可諱言的。不過遂漸的當一位老明檻的影迷，花錢來看一張片子的時候，也曉得先將導演先生的大名注意一下了。譬如說；好來塢最著名的五大導演：佛蘭克卡潑拉，佛蘭克勞埃，西席地密爾，的翰福特和范達克，他們在報上的排名都在一般大明星之上，這無非是他們對於觀衆具有更大吸引力的緣故。　　你也許常常聽到這樣的說話：「一張片子的優劣雖決定於故事本身的動人與否」。其實按理這句話應該改爲：「一張片子的好壞是決定於導演的技巧如何」？須知一位優秀的攀演，能够攝出一張美滿的片子，雖則劇本不見高妙，反之一個老爺的導演，就算給他世界上頂好的劇本，他也弄不出好東西來。　　導演非但要在事前排定角色，在攝製時敎演員如何演述劇詞，有時還要現身說法，代替演員的地位將恰到好處的表悄演給他們做榜樣，所以大多數的導演，木身就是技術高超的演員。因爲導演的地位如此重要，故此他們大都具有眞才實學而斷不是濫竽充數的。阿英之公子錢毅（左）應雲衛之女公子薇薇（右）與呂吉胡導之熱烈表情  穆一龍攝　　記葉斯音樂會  音波　　斯義桂業懷德二君的音樂會於日前假美國婦女會舉行。在已往誰曾欣賞過他們動人的音色與精鍊的技巧的，莫不同聲贊美，此番重來，自當刮目相。看　　斯君是蘇石林君的高足，唱低音天賦極厚，加以刻苦自勵，在音專時代已蜚聲藝壇。他有雄厚的音量與嘹亮的音色，最後一支伏爾加船夫曲，更博得不少熱烈的掌聲。　　葉君的長笛，也是久已聞名的，曾記得他在聖約翰時代，已稱我國獨步。長笛最適宜奏輕快的曲子，而雜君更爲擅長。他曾指揮過好幾個大學（如之江交通聖約翰等）的管絃樂隊與歌詠團，成績優異並聞伊在作曲上曾下一番的苦工。南洋片商　——競購國片  亦海　　留滬之南洋片商，當歐戰開始擴大之際，曾暫取觀望態度，近以南洋一帶尙屬平靜，故已　續簽購新片，且情形殊爲踴躍，聞以近日外滙較長，在上海川法幣折合南洋幣價付款，較以前能便宜不少也。　　南京路四八六號進修袖習學校及進修圖畫館，原定於本月十一日舉行民衆音樂欣賞會，後因接工部局臨時通知而改期，茲聞已定於本月二十五日（星期六）晚七時半舉行，除原有節目外，並請邵雨文邵榮華姊妹表演吉太及口琴，凡領得原有入塲券者，必須於二十三日前至該校掉換新券。雨過天靑  包天笑　　第廿四回　湖山蕩滌各有千秋　士女歡騰共呼萬歲　　他們當時回到了自由村小學校，約略參觀了一下，也便吃夜飯了。鄉村間的蔬菜魚肉，那是出產之區，當然都是鮮美可口。而且朱村長近來却是提倡多吃蔬菜，少吃魚肉。蔬菜改良種植，也是自由村的農產副業。至於鷄鴨之類，也有好幾處養鷄放鴨之塲，他們都是爲生卵哺雛之需，不肯輕於　業。雖然吃了一頓鄉下飯，却是大家很爲滿意，尤其是蘇理雅太太，讚不絕口。蘇理雅太太參觀了自由村小學校後，她捐了三千塊錢給自由　圖書館。原來這目山村圖書館，也是新辦起來的，就設立在自山村小學校以內。朱村長每年有一筆卹金，約兩三百錢左右，積了五平工夫，也有千餘元光景。朱村長就把　筆踐，作爲一個鄉村圖書館的基金。但是區區）千餘元，未免太少了，後來承各處陸續捐錢捐書的不少，總　資本，也有三千餘　。大家說：這個圖書館，以朱老先生。榮戰傷所得的卹金而創辦起來的，應該以朱老先生的姓名，名此圖書　。但是朱老先生不願　，說我是爲自由村設立的，不是私家的圖書　。將來有機會，我們要極力擴充，自由村的人，官極力把它扶植起來。要知道我們中國從前的積弱，就是爲的識字讀書的人，實在太少了。尤其是鄕村間，絕少有知識的人，所以我現在給它植一個基礎，以後可以逐漸擴充起來。小來這個自由村圖書館，也頂備雙！節那　天正式揭幕的。此刻忽然加了蘇理雅太太　三千塊錢的捐叻金，好像來了一支生力軍：這使朱老先生愈加　興了。此刻距—月十日的國慶紀念，還有十來天，朱老先生却已在預備一切。他以爲白己年紀老了，做過了民國四十年的或慶紀念，到民國五—年的國慶紀念，大槪自已不午世七了。听以很想熱鬧一天，最好把今天來的這幾位來賓，到那—天，都請他們來。但是他雖有此心，却不敢說，因爲他們都有職務，况且自由村做國慶紀念，別地方也得做國慶紀念，別地方正有大規模的國慶紀念，何苦的到我們這個小地方來呢？可是朱愛人已知道老祖父的心事了，她要想法子，敎老祖父那天開心一下。　（二八四）</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Battle of Yubei, Henan Province, Unfolds: Chinese Troops Complete Counter-Encircling Maneuver; Japanese Counterattacking Forces Southeast of Zaoyang Repeatedly Suffer Setbacks; Chinese Forces Advancing on Xianghua, Beijing-Zhongxiang Routes Make Excellent Progress <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Guanghua: Since the 19th, Chinese forces in southern Henan and northern Hubei have once again implemented a thorough plan to annihilate the Japanese with extremely agile maneuvers. On one hand, they are doing their utmost to contain the Japanese forces in the area, preventing them from escaping, and after thoroughly allowing them to launch their inevitable counterattacks, they are gradually attracting them northward, guiding them directly into the trap pre-set by the Chinese. By the 21st, it was clear that the stubborn Japanese were gradually stepping into the edge of the area expected by the Chinese. The main force of the Chinese army on the front has already moved out to the flanks of the Japanese, with the Chinese forces advancing from the sides and closely pursuing the Japanese rear, completing a stronger large-scale counter-encirclement of the Japanese, jointly advancing towards the goal of annihilating the remaining Japanese in one fell swoop. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Nanyang: On the 21st, the Chinese army discovered that the remaining Japanese had entered the area initially designated by the Chinese for annihilating the Japanese. All the heroic warriors were exceptionally excited. According to the plan, which had not yet been fully completed at this point, they immediately implemented a very strong counter-encirclement of the Japanese. Currently, the deployment is gradually being completed, and the encirclement is being tightened from all sides, exerting its power to collectively annihilate the remaining Japanese. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Xiangyang: Since May 1st, the remaining Japanese, who had been continuously defeated by the Chinese forces on the border of Henan and Hubei, joined forces on the 19th with more than 10,000 Japanese reinforcements from the south. In the area southeast of Zaoyang, they launched a counterattack on the Chinese forces in multiple routes, relying on the remaining 200-plus vehicles and the cover of a large number of aircraft. The offensive was quite fierce. The Chinese army once again launched a large-scale mobile war. Since the 20th, in the areas on both sides of the Tang River and Bai River, they have inflicted blows on the Japanese at every turn. The Japanese forces have suffered repeated setbacks and heavy casualties. At noon on the 21st, the Chinese army gradually completed a new deployment and began to encircle and attack the Japanese forces in the area expected by the Chinese. The various armies repeatedly attacking the southern sections of the Xianghua Road and Beijing-Zhongxiang Road have now established contact with the newly added Chinese forces, cutting off the Japanese rear lines of communication while vigorously developing towards the southeast. Within days, they will be able to join forces with the victorious Chinese army from southern Henan to move south and attack the Japanese. The great battle is actively unfolding in the Jianghan exchange zone. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese dispatch arriving here today, the Chinese army is currently fiercely attacking the Japanese army entrenched south of Xinyang City. The Japanese army is putting up a desperate resistance. Currently, the Chinese army has controlled most of Xinyang. The complete retreat of the Japanese army is only a matter of time. In northern Hubei, along the Pinghan Railway, the Chinese army is said to have completely controlled the Wusheng Pass mountain paths at the foot of the Dabie Mountains and is attacking the Japanese army to the south. Currently, the Japanese army is guarding Guangshui. The Japanese attempt to break through the Chinese defenses in Zaoyang completely failed yesterday. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The Japanese forces retreating near Zaoyang have been gathering their remnants in recent days, and more than 10,000 people have been reinforced from the south, making another desperate struggle. Since the 19th, they have used a large number of aircraft and tanks as cover, advancing in disarray in multiple groups. One part engaged in another bloody battle with the Chinese forces on the outskirts of Xiangyang and attempted to stealthily cross the Bai River to harass the northwest. The Chinese are intercepting and attacking them in separate routes. Another group of Japanese troops attempted to take Shuanggou as a gathering point to cross the Xiang River, participating with more than 200 tanks and 50-plus aircraft. After the Chinese forces met them head-on with a severe blow, the Japanese forces suffered a major setback and have fallen into a dilemma where they cannot advance or retreat.

<p>Shaoguan: More than 1,600 Japanese troops from Zengcheng advanced towards Paitan on the afternoon of the 14th and engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese army until the morning of the 20th. The Japanese offensive was suddenly thwarted, and the Chinese army took the opportunity to switch to an offensive on the entire front, annihilating more than 600 Japanese. The Japanese retreated towards Zengcheng. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Yingde: The Japanese troops who attacked Fengmen’ao and Baibuti and were defeated by the Chinese army returned on the 19th to attack the areas of Shidong, Niuguling, and Xicaotang.

<p>Wengyuan: The Japanese troops who were defeated by the Chinese army near Mibu broke out of the encirclement and returned to attack.

<p>Chongqing: Chinese officials said moments ago that Chinese fighter planes engaged Japanese planes last night, resulting in the shooting down of one Japanese plane. The plane has crashed in Changshou, 30 miles northeast of Chongqing. Other Japanese planes are also said to have suffered serious damage. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Japanese planes attacking Chongqing in recent days have suffered heavy damage. Especially in the air battle over Liangshan on the 20th, the heroic Chinese air force achieved a great victory, shooting down as many as seven Japanese planes. At 9:33 a.m. on the 22nd, 54 Japanese planes attacked the airspace of the Chinese capital again. Upon receiving the news, the Chinese air force immediately rose to meet them. The Japanese ultimately fled to high altitude, hoping to avoid the interwoven fire net of the Chinese air force, but still suffered repeated attacks from the Chinese air force. Two Japanese planes were immediately seriously damaged and fled. The remaining Japanese planes dropped bombs on desolate land in the suburbs, with no losses on the Chinese side. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Last night and today, Japanese planes again bombed the suburbs of Chongqing. It is estimated that more than 50 Japanese bombers attacked this morning, flying over the city at an altitude of 10,000 feet. Air raid sirens were sounded here last night. Only five hours after the alert was lifted, the alarm was raised again at 6:45 this morning. The first batch of more than 30 Japanese planes arrived over the city at 7:30 in the morning. The second batch of 27 planes arrived at 9:45 a.m. The alert was lifted at 10:40 a.m. More than 30 Japanese planes attacked last night, which was particularly spectacular. According to Chinese sources, the first two batches of Japanese planes were driven back by Chinese fighter planes. The third batch of Japanese planes engaged in a fierce battle with Chinese planes for five minutes. Explosions burst in the air, and searchlights flashed. It is reported that one Japanese plane was shot down, but this has not been confirmed.

<p>Chongqing: On the 21st, Minister Weng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued an order to all economic enterprise management agencies under his jurisdiction, advising staff to maintain integrity and pursue fairness in handling affairs. The order stated that the government manages various economic enterprises selectively to ensure that supply and demand are balanced and prices are stable. When things are necessary, they should be handled conscientiously. However, since the staff has more contact with various enterprises, they must maintain integrity and pursue fairness in handling affairs. They must not seek private gain or favor relatives and friends, causing adverse effects on the people. The Ministry has always been extremely hateful of corrupt personnel. If any acts of embezzlement or malpractice by relying on their position are found, they will be severely punished. They are also expected to supervise at all times and not be negligent in the slightest. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

The Japanese commander Yamada So was also shot dead on the spot. On the 19th, the victorious Chinese troops, taking advantage of their momentum, continued to recapture the northern Zha Village of Yangcheng, capturing a great deal. The Chinese troops who recaptured Changjieling continued to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in Yin Zhuang and Qianhou Guangou on the 18th. Yin Zhuang and Qianhou Guangou have been recovered. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to Huanglong Temple, where their rear was cut off by the Chinese, and they could not escape, falling into the Chinese encirclement. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Judicial expenses in various provinces have traditionally been paid by local governments. In recent years, based on the resolutions of previous Central Plenary Sessions and the suggestions of the National Political Council and other institutions, the government decided to overcome difficulties and supplement the judicial organs. It has already included 5 million yuan in the central general budget for the 29th year to supplement the expenses of the judicial organs in various provinces. On one hand, the Executive and Judicial Yuan have supervised the relevant ministries to negotiate on the implementation areas and the issue of expense allocation. It has been agreed that this year, it will be implemented in nine provinces first: Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Xikang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guangxi, Ningxia, and Qinghai. (Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The Sichuan Provincial Government is now organizing a price stabilization office with a capital of 20 million yuan, half of which is contributed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and half by the Provincial Treasury, and will be operating in Chengdu. Sichuan's prices are "high, and the people are very troubled, especially with rice. Recently, the government used 150 handcarts to transport 40,000 dan of rice to Chengdu to be sold at a fair price to benefit the poor. Other daily necessities such as cloth, fuel, and salt will also have their prices suppressed. It is said that there is no shortage of daily necessities in Sichuan. Taking rice as an example, the average annual surplus reaches as much as 10 million dan. The current high price of rice must be due to hoarding and manipulation by someone. Last year, the production of various goods in Sichuan was greatly expanded. According to figures released today, Chongqing currently weaves 60,000 bolts of cloth, 10,000 dozen socks, and produces 4,000 bales of cotton yarn and 80,000 bags of flour each month. The Chongqing Price Stabilization Committee is currently importing a large number of goods from major coastal areas in an attempt to suppress local prices. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e12">Can Japan Emulate Germany? <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>It has been several decades since the Meiji Restoration in Japan. It is a historical miracle that a small island nation has suddenly joined the ranks of the world's leading powers. However, this achievement lacks a deep historical foundation and has not undergone thorough reforms. Although it may appear glorious and brilliant on the surface, it contains countless contradictions and flaws. Among them, what is particularly noteworthy is the cultural and academic aspect: everything old was copied from China, and the new learning has been closely following the West; apart from imitation and elaboration, there is almost no creation to speak of, and thus it cannot develop into an independent cultural system. This is a serious issue concerning the fundamental basis of Japan's founding, and cannot be concealed by temporary prosperity and power.</p>
<p>The above situation can be found in countless examples in the Japanese military aggression against China. It is said that the Japanese army recently used a large number of tanks, armored vehicles, aircraft, and other weapons to launch a fierce offensive in the battle on the border of Henan and Hubei, intending to imitate the German "Blitzkrieg" strategy used in the Western European war. As for the ultimate goal of the German army's strategy, whether it is gain or loss cannot be determined today; but from the perspective of the strategy and tactics themselves, it is indeed a major change in military technology, worthy of military talents all over the world to lower their heads and learn from, and to re-examine those corrupt and old tactical theories. The sudden imitation by the Japanese military authorities seems not to be at the forefront of the trend. Make plans for the ultimate change; but is this kind of imitation likely to succeed?</p>
<p>The so-called Blitzkrieg tactics are nothing more than gathering a large number of mechanized troops and sharp weapons, and taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to launch a rapid and fierce attack. This kind of application must consume multiples of the equipment and lives compared to ordinary military attacks; therefore, the reserves and replenishment of military weapons and ammunition must be abundant and rapid, and the morale of the troops must be courageous and developed in order to achieve the effect of overwhelming superiority. The occasions for its application must also be conducive to a quick and decisive battle, preparing to complete a specific goal in the shortest period of time. Germany's recent repeated successes in this strategy are due to the high degree of development of its heavy industry, and the large-scale production and supply of military equipment; the reason for its decision is that under the strict control and theoretical hypnosis of the Nazis, the people have long possessed the conditions of war machines; The aspirations of the German nation, the insults of the Treaty of Versailles. All see this war as a way to vent; Secondly, there are simple and clear operational goals, such as the Polish, Danish, Norwegian, Belgian, Dutch and French invasions, so they can harvest the expected results for a while. If the war is prolonged thereafter, the front line is in stalemate, and the hostile situation gradually becomes complex from simple, then its effectiveness must be gradually weakened. People are only shocked by the brilliant record of Blitzkrieg tactics, but do not pursue the conditions for its success, which is a mistake.</p>
<p>At present, all the situations of the Japanese army are exactly the opposite of those of the German army. The morale has already declined, and the national strength is almost exhausted. Although sharp weapons are the only reliance for the Japanese to win, the number is absolutely insufficient to compare with Germany, and it cannot withstand the consumption of large halos. Trying Blitzkrieg tactics in this way only shows that they do not know their own strength and speed up their own failure. The course of the recent Henan-Hubei campaign has provided a clear example. Especially since the Sino-Japanese War has developed into a plane war at this stage. Mobile warfare, protracted warfare, are absolutely not suitable for the application of Blitzkrieg tactics, and there is no target that can be regarded by the Japanese army as a kind of heart to attack. Taking a step back, even if the Japanese army in northern Hubei luckily succeeds this time, at best it will only expand the periphery of the Wuhan stronghold, which has nothing to do with the victory or defeat of the overall war. What's more, the parachute troops and fifth columns used in the German Blitzkrieg strategy are completely lacking on the Japanese side; there is no training for parachute troops in Japan at all, and with the current war-weariness of Japanese soldiers and civilians, the application of this tactic is almost impossible; as for the Japanese fifth column, they can only parasitize in the occupied areas, and act in an authoritarian manner, but they have no effect on the rear of China. Looking at the course of the Sino-Japanese War, only the Battle of Shanghai and Nanjing was more suitable for the application of Blitzkrieg tactics; however, the Japanese staff talents at that time not only failed to invent before Germany, but their troops were gradually supplemented from the initial 10,000 or 20,000 people to the final 200,000 people, which is exactly the opposite of the use of Blitzkrieg tactics. Within the area of Shanghai and Nanjing, which is hundreds of miles, the confrontation lasted for three months, which laid the initial foundation for the victory of the Chinese War of Resistance, while the Japanese army lost the opportunity for a quick victory, and even if they imitated the German strategy vividly afterwards, they would have nothing to show off.</p>
<p>The imitation of Germany by Japanese strategy and tactics has not only been from today. The experiences of the Prussian-Austrian and Prussian-French wars have always been regarded as a model for combat theory in Japan. Since Tai Shan Yan brought the "Sedan" strategy back to the East from Germany, Yamagata Aritomo personally directed an encirclement and annihilation tactic in the Battle of Pyongyang and achieved success. "Sedan" and the "Tannenberg" that followed became the strategic models in the minds of Japanese soldiers. However, only imitating and failing to adapt to the environment to change has caused these military entourages to suffer serious blows; in the three-year Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese army has always had "Sedan" and "Tannenberg" in mind twice, but has never succeeded, and instead has repeatedly formed the object of being surrounded and annihilated; the reasons are of course multifaceted, and there is no doubt that their only knowing how to imitate is the main weakness.</p>
<p>If they are smart, seeing the recent achievements of the German military, the heads of Kasumigaseki should turn back! Learning to walk in Handan and failing to draw a tiger will not only cause ridicule, but the result will only be a more miserable failure. There is no shortage of enlightened people on the Japanese side who should be able to recognize the serious problems of Japan itself from this lesson; unfortunately, reason in Japan has not yet reached the point where it can raise its head.</p>

<p>Paris: Military sources here recently stated that although no major changes occurred in the situation on the front last night, Arras has been recaptured by our army. The situation of the battles on each route is summarized as follows: (1) The situation on the north bank of the Somme River is quite chaotic due to the infiltration of small, agile German units into the Picardy region. (2) On the Belgian side, the Allied forces are engaged in fierce battles with the German army in the Scheldt River area, which have not stopped so far. (3) Both sides are fighting day and night in the Cambrai area, with mutual victories and losses, but the city of Arras has been recovered. (4) The line from the Aisne River to the southwest of Sedan and the entire Maginot Line are as solid as gold. The enemy army must not cross the line. (5) The German troops who have infiltrated Picardy are only small, agile units. Their vanguard has already arrived near Amiens, and another small unit is attacking the Abbeville railway station. All bridges on the Somme River have been destroyed by the French army, and it will be difficult for the German army to cross them. The situation on the Aisne River is also the same. In addition, the German army has not taken any action in the Rethel region. The garrison of the French Montmédy fortress continues to resist vigorously, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, and the enemy's offensive has been frustrated. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris: The Ministry of the Army recently issued a communiqué declaring that the French army has recovered Arras, a militarily important location that the Germans could use to attack Abbeville. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: Responsible German military officials declared that after Germany advanced from Amiens to Abbeville, it has completed the encirclement of the Allied forces on the Franco-Belgian border. German mechanized units and infantry are advancing steadily. The Belgian troops on the eastern flank are still fighting valiantly, but the British troops have retreated to the English Channel, wantonly destroying all areas they pass through. The French Ninth Army is in danger of being annihilated. General Giraud, the commander of the army, has been captured by the German army. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German side here declared last night that the German troops who reached the English Channel yesterday were not only advance units, but the total number of troops was about 60,000 or more, and there are many more powerful troops coming later. The German army spared no sacrifices. Yesterday, it swept through 60 miles along the Somme River through Amiens and Arras to Abbeville on the English Channel. Allied prisoners numbered in the hundreds. Abbeville is only 60 miles away from the British port of Hastings, which is enough to serve as a base for bomber squadrons and paratroopers to attack England. (Taiwan Zhong Dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>London: German troops reached the English Channel yesterday, only 60 miles from the port of Hastings. Britain has hastily stepped up its defenses, preparing for the first invasion of England by a foreign enemy in 874 years. Many fear that the British Navy, which has defended the country's integrity for many centuries, will be helpless against the German bomber squadrons and paratrooper tactics. Last night, a German plane was discovered off the southeast coast of England and was driven away by anti-aircraft guns. At the moment, defensive posts to annihilate paratroopers have been set up everywhere in London. Military circles do not recognize the German advance to Abbeville on the English Channel as a victorious battle, because the strongholds broken through by the German mechanized units have not yet consolidated their positions. (United Press dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>German Military Communiqué</p>
<p>Berlin: This afternoon, the German military report stated that yesterday's German actions were to advance northwest with the English Channel as the target. German military aircraft attacked the ports of Ostend, Dunkirk, Béthune, and Dieppe. The enemy forces in the Flanders region stubbornly resisted. In the Valenciennes area, the German army launched a fierce attack on the enemy. The enemy's attempts to break through to the southwest were unsuccessful. British tank units were defeated in the Arras area. German Junkers bombers made the greatest contribution to repelling the British tanks. In the battle of Zeeland a few days ago, the German army won more with less and captured 1,600 French soldiers. The enemy forces in the area of Neufchâtel-Hardelot have been defeated, the fortress has been occupied by the German army, 12 officers have been captured, and 500 soldiers have been captured. The main purpose of the German Air Force's activities yesterday was to prevent the enemy's retreat. Many enemy air force bases and aircraft were destroyed. The train stations at Compiègne and Creil were hit and caught fire. Near the coast of France and Belgium, German aircraft destroyed one cruiser, one cargo ship, and eleven military ships. Several other ships were also destroyed. A total of 120 enemy planes were lost yesterday, and 10 German planes are missing. (Haitong dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>German Front Line on the Western Front: General Reichnau, commander of the German Sixth Army, told foreign reporters at his headquarters yesterday that the final decisive battle has not yet arrived. At the moment, it is still the initial encounter battle, and the German army is only initially testing its victory, and has not yet engaged the main force of the enemy army. However, a great war will definitely occur, and we are prepared to achieve victory. He also said that so far in the offensive, the German losses are only one-tenth of the prisoners captured. Reichnau did not specify the exact number of German losses, but said that based on an estimate of the number of Allied prisoners captured, it should be around 11,000 to 12,000 people.

<p>Weigand Exerts All His Strength to Save the Critical Situation, Confident He Has a Grasp On It</p>
<p>Paris – Premier and Minister of National Defense Reynaud recently addressed the press, stating roughly: "General Weigand, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, has just returned to the capital from the front. According to his account, if the nation can, with unyielding perseverance, fulfill its responsibilities, then I am extremely confident about the future of the war." The Commander-in-Chief has spoken thus, and all our countrymen must not harbor fear because of the enemy's motorized forces. These forces are no different from the cavalry of old; if they become excessively rampant, they will inevitably become uncontrollable. At this critical juncture, all countrymen must exert themselves for the country and not remain idle at home. Understand that even a small reduction in production weakens the nation's strength. Therefore, the government will immediately issue orders to military and political authorities to pay attention to this at all times. In short, if we can hold out for one month (in reality, we are determined to hold out to the end), we will have already achieved three-quarters of the victory." (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris – A military spokesman here announced last night that General Weigand is now on the battlefield, making all necessary decisions, the results of which remain to be seen. Although the situation is extremely serious, we can maintain confidence and wait for it. It is noted that General Weigand has now replaced General Gamelin as the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied forces in all theaters. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>French Counteroffensive Wins, London Greatly Excited</p>
<p>London – The news that French forces have retaken Arras after fierce fighting has had a stimulating effect in London. The public spirit is greatly boosted. Some quarters interpret this as an indication that France, under the leadership of General Weigand, has begun a major counteroffensive. While we cannot be overly optimistic about the current victory, experts believe that this may be the initial action to stop the German advance from Abbeville towards the coast. The news of the recapture of Arras has made the stock exchange more stable, with various prominent government bonds seeing a rebound. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>London – The "News Chronicle" reports that "at this time, our only virtue is courage, and our only vice is uttering defeat." Although the Ninth Army has suffered a setback, the other great forces of France remain undamaged and have yet to engage the enemy in a decisive battle. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Natural Barrier of the Aisne River Easy to Defend, German Forces' Forced Crossing Ultimately Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Paris – Military figures here have recently stated that German light units have occupied the cities of Amiens and Arras. However, there is no official confirmation of German claims that they have occupied Abbeville at the mouth of the Somme River. The British Expeditionary Force is engaged in fierce fighting with German forces. The number of British troops is still unknown. In the Cambrai sector, repeated German advances have been blocked. French forces are now holding new positions. German forces have repeatedly attempted to force a crossing of the Aisne River, whether in the west, in the east, or in the area around Rethel, but have not succeeded. This shows that rivers are inherently natural barriers; simply destroying bridges prevents tank columns from advancing. As for the Somme River, it is also being firmly defended by French forces. From the Somme River to the Rhine River, French forces are now deploying, with a neat military appearance. They are extremely confident that they will be able to meet any German advance head-on and win. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>German Aircraft Appear Over Paris, Air Raid Alarm Twice in One Night in England</p>
<p>Berlin – Yesterday, German air force planes reached the skies over Paris, but whether it was reconnaissance or bombing is not yet known. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>London – The first air raid alarm in months was issued on the southeastern coast of England last night. Intense gunfire and machine-gun fire erupted offshore. The wailing of the alarm was mingled with the whistle blowing of air raid wardens. Air raid lights were turned on everywhere. The sound of aircraft could be clearly heard. According to an announcement from the Ministry of Aviation, an air raid alarm was issued and lifted one hour later last night. When a German plane approached a certain city on the southeast coast last night, no air raid alarm was issued. The plane dropped bombs into the sea near the coast, seemingly attempting to bomb ships, but missed. Naval patrol boats opened fire, but the German plane flew over the city and then turned south. Continuing intense gunfire was subsequently heard in the south. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3 id="e15">British House of Commons Authorizes Government to Control National Resources: Attlee Explains Bill, Responsibility of All to Save the Critical Situation <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>London – The Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons, Attlee, stated today after questioning, regarding the serious situation: "I am now informing the House that, given the current critical situation, the government has no choice but to request the House to grant special powers through a bill. This bill must pass through all stages in both Houses today. Every member is deeply aware of the seriousness of the overall situation, and every member knows that yesterday hung in the balance. The great war is now underway. Our soldiers on the sea, land, and air are now engaged in battle with bright courage, loyalty, and skill (cheers), aided by the freedom-loving people of our Allied nations. We cannot yet know the outcome of the current great war, but everyone should understand that the coming weeks are critical. The brutal enemy, disregarding international law and fairness or humanity, is now pouring all its resources into winning. We will not allow them to succeed (cheers). The government firmly believes that the time has come for us to mobilize our nation's entire resources to the utmost. We must exert all our strength to engage in the struggle. Every private interest must be sacrificed to meet the urgent needs of the nation. We cannot know what will be revealed in the coming weeks or days, but whatever may come, we will face it, for Englishmen have encountered danger in the past and overcome it. But as necessity dictates, the government must now be granted complete control over people and property, not just over certain individuals or certain strata of the population, but over the entire nation, rich and poor, employers and workers, men and women, or property, without distinction. The power I am requesting in the House this afternoon is this kind of power. I am not requesting it in a spirit of panic; there is no need for panic today. However, what we are requesting is that, in this time of rapid change, the necessary powers that are or will be needed be granted to the government. To ensure that this bill passes through all stages, it must be moved as a temporary motion. The government asks this House, in light of the serious danger the nation is now in, to approve this procedure. The form of the resolution is the same as the motion proposed in August of last year for requesting the immediate passage of the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act original bill." The Emergency Powers (Defence) Act, mentioned by Attlee, was announced this afternoon. The bill expands the powers exercised by the King under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act of 1939, stating: "In light of the development of the war since that day, it is now imperative to expand the powers mentioned above so that, when needed, the entire resources of the nation can be immediately used for purposes related to the defense of the nation. All personnel and their duties, and their property, may be dispatched by the King to ensure public safety, defend the nation, maintain public order, or effectively conduct the war, and all services necessary to maintain supplies or the people's livelihood may be ordered by the Cabinet." The bill was explained by Attlee, debated for less than an hour, and the House of Commons unanimously passed the second reading. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e16">British Minister of Information Broadcasts Speech, Convinced Allied Forces Will Turn the Tide <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>London – Minister of Information Duff Cooper delivered a broadcast speech last night, saying: "Although the news is quite serious at present, there is no reason for alarm. The Germans are using a new technology, allowing small units of German troops to penetrate deeply, but these are only small units. British forces and a larger number of French forces are still present, have not retreated, and have not suffered significant losses. It is impossible to know the true situation while the war is ongoing. From the fragments of information we receive, it is easy to make various conjectures. There are three facts that can be stated with certainty: (1) The Germans' current objective is the ports of the English Channel, hoping to attack Britain from there. (2) A small part of the German mechanized forces has bypassed its opponents and penetrated a great distance, and is approaching its target. (3) The British and French forces have not been defeated. They occupy the battlefield with absolutely superior numbers. When the time for a counterattack arrives, they will prove the dreadfulness of their power. The temporary fortunes of war are not of great importance; the most important thing is the outcome. I explained to you last week that the outcome of this war, no matter what, cannot place Britain and France in a position of failure. This situation is generally well-known, but those who are in the midst of it often cannot help but be surprised by it. The sudden advance with unexpected force, and the gains made at the beginning, are often beyond expectation. This was also true of the German offensives in August 1914 and March 1918 during the Great War. Therefore, we hope that the Germans will have the same ending this time. We must all fulfill our responsibilities, for the war is now so close to our shores that we are, in effect, already in the midst of it. The first thing we must have is courage. I firmly believe that we do not lack this quality. I now once again warn the people against the danger of rumors. My personal experience this afternoon is a perfect example..."</p>
<h3 id="e17">Further Interpretation of Reynaud's Speech <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>"...because according to a very reliable report, it was said that the French Premier had declared that nothing could save his country except a miracle. Although I do not believe that the steadfast and striving Reynaud would make such a statement, I was quite fearful at the time and relayed this matter to several friends, but I did not understand until I read his speech that it was completely different from what was rumored. Reynaud's speech expressed the highest confidence; he firmly believed that nothing could defeat the combined forces of Britain and France, and said that if tomorrow or the day after, anyone with a weak will were to tell him that nothing but a miracle could save France, he would confidently declare that such a miracle would be realized because he had the belief to save France. I firmly believe that the current serious events have been a tonic for the whole nation, for a calm and resolute spirit can be seen everywhere. The situation in the House of Commons this afternoon was very different from before the recess. I cannot help but recall Macaulay's famous saying, 'None for party, all for the state.' Our original partisan opinions were very deep in the past, and perhaps they will be again in the future, but for now, they have been set aside and are no longer useful. Those of us in the rear must each fulfill our duties, just like the soldiers who are on guard tonight on the front lines or who will be attacking the enemy at dawn tomorrow. They should know that behind the stable front lines, there is great trust backing them up." (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>London – As German forces advance even closer to the British coast, preparations are being accelerated within Britain to prevent German paratroopers from landing and the activities of the "Fifth Column." The authorities are now considering obliterating the names of village railway stations to prevent German paratroopers from finding their destinations by map. National civilian defense organizations have been rapidly established. The threat of enemy invasion only strengthens the people's calm and determined resolve. New civilian defense teams are now being trained on how to track paratroopers as soon as they land. It is said that because German paratroopers carry hand-held machine guns with a range of 500 yards, observers must conceal themselves well to avoid being harmed. In addition, civilians are being notified that if several German paratroopers occupy a village, they must try to destroy food and drink and stay indoors until armed defense teams arrive to rescue them. Defense team leaders across the country have listed the targets of German paratroopers as stations, intersections, factories, bridges, and unharvested crops, because only a few small incendiary bombs are needed to cause significant damage. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris – According to news received here, German paratroopers carrying incendiary equipment and explosives seem to have greatly aided the German advance north of the Somme River in the past two days. After landing, they immediately went to railway junctions, stations, bridges, and public buildings to cause disruption. It is said that even if a large number of these paratroopers were to land, although they might cause a serious situation, they could not achieve a firm occupation without the help of a very large land force.

As for some cabinet members in Sainte-Adresse, France, they are now trying to resolve some urgent and serious difficulties, such as the large number of our refugees who have gone to France to seek refuge, among whom are thousands of strong men who are willing to serve the country. If they can be trained, the strength of our army will definitely be enriched. Once the new army is established, our army will have a million strong men to defend the motherland and will not easily give up an inch of land.

<p>Washington – Congress is now prepared to discuss another new naval bill provided by the government, which appropriates US$29,587,000 to immediately strengthen US defenses in the Pacific. Although the bill does not mention appropriations to develop the defenses of Guam, it advocates using US$5,582,000 to develop the defenses of Wake Island, one of the two major projects in the new defense plan. The reason Guam is not mentioned in the bill is fear of causing congressional debate and delaying the bill's passage. It is noteworthy that the bill includes defense funds for Wake Island, as the US Navy has never before received large sums of money to develop this Pacific outpost. According to congressional sources last night, this new defense bill is part of President Roosevelt's US$3,000,000,000 defense budget and should be passed soon. The bill was submitted to the Senate yesterday by Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Affairs Committee. In the House, the bill was introduced by Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee. The funds in the bill are to be used to acquire land sufficient for the construction of Pacific defenses and to increase the US Air Force in the Pacific. (United Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington – Senate Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Walsh and House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson, after holding a meeting today with President Roosevelt and naval authorities, have submitted bills to their respective committees with two main points: (1) The total number of naval aircraft should be increased to 10,000 within two to three years, and the number of pilots should be increased to 16,000, with an estimated cost of US$250,000,000. (2) Twenty-one locations across the United States coast and naval bases, excluding Guam, should organize defenses in both land and air, with an estimated cost of US$123,132,000, and it will take three to five years to complete all of them. The names of the twenty-one locations are listed below: Norfolk, Virginia; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Panama Canal Zone; Seattle, Washington; Alaskan Peninsula; Pearl Harbor, Hawaii; Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii; Midway Island; Wake Island; Johnston Island; Quonset Point, Rhode Island; Quantico, Virginia; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; Virgin Islands; Charlotte Amalie, Virgin Islands; San Diego, California; Alameda, California; Unalaska Island, Aleutian Islands; Canton Island; Tongue Point, Oregon; Corpus Christi, Texas. (Havas dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington – A joint statement by Senate and House Naval Affairs Committee Chairmen Walsh and Vinson stated that President Roosevelt proposed using US$100 million to build naval aviation facilities and train naval aviation personnel, and will submit a bill requesting an additional US$125,000,000 to establish and develop naval aviation bases. The two committees are also taking major action against "Fifth Column" activities, as they have approved measures to dismiss suspicious workers and soldiers. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<p>Washington - President Roosevelt, yesterday at a reception for newspaper reporters, denounced the German planes' strafing of French refugees, stating that German planes descended rapidly over French territory and fiercely strafed refugees on the road. The number of refugee casualties is unprecedented. He believes America will understand the implications of this type of warfare. Regarding the phrase "implications," President Roosevelt did not clarify what he thought was implied, but stated that America is united in the current situation. The faster news arrives from Europe, the more united the American people become. Along a two-mile front in France, there are now five million women and children, mostly walking or riding in vehicles, fleeing south along various roads and being strafed by German planes. President Roosevelt's attitude was calm when he condemned the German planes' strafing of French women, children, and the elderly, but he showed sincerity, deeply moving the newspaper reporters. President Roosevelt also revealed the following three points regarding the general discussion policy of the defense program: (1) Not to allow Americans to become immensely wealthy from overseas war disasters; (2) Laborers must not seek their own benefit in the current emergency situation; (3) The government absolutely does not intend to weaken the social achievements it has made in the past two years.

<p>Washington - When the Senate began debating the Army supply bill yesterday, Democratic Senator Chamberlain stated, "The European war in the next few days may become a turning point in civilization." Chamberlain introduced a resolution authorizing President Roosevelt to sell any existing military aircraft and cash from the U.S. Army and Navy to the Allied powers. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt stated that he is aware that Democratic Senator Pepper has submitted a bill to the Senate proposing to authorize the President to sell existing aircraft of the Army and Navy to Britain and France, but he refused to express an opinion. Observers generally believe that the purpose of this bill is to test the opinions of members of Congress in order to ascertain the extent to which the U.S. government can assist Britain and France. Moreover, this bill proposes to sell aircraft to Britain and France, which is tantamount to explicitly prohibiting the sale of these aircraft to Germany. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow to discuss this bill. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Washington - Today, political and diplomatic circles here are discussing the conclusion of a new international agreement in the Americas, jointly defending North and South America against external aggression, as the main topic of discussion. Washington officials stated that President Roosevelt's recent proposal for a $3,000,000,000 bill to fund national defense does not yet involve international defense steps. However, these steps may not be realized until Congress passes this massive national defense bill. Military observers believe that President Roosevelt's defense plan must include agreements with other countries in the Western Hemisphere, enabling the United States to build naval and air bases in South America.

<p>Washington - The American people have been shaken frequently in the past two weeks. Germany's declaration today that it has reached the English Channel has caused a new shock. Coupled with newspapers filled with thrilling news, the public has risen up to criticize the Republican Party, as its isolationist policy is based on the invincibility of the Allied powers. In the past few months, President Roosevelt has tried to awaken public opinion and draw attention to the increasing danger in Europe, but the Republican Party has called it unwarranted alarmism. Colonel Lindbergh has also been heavily criticized, and many have denounced him as pro-German, as Lindbergh once claimed that the government's defense plan was a delusional call for aggression. At the same time, Congress is now passing national defense legislation at a very rapid pace, and there are many proposals advocating unlimited actions, such as selling the entire U.S. Army, Navy, and Air Force to the Allied powers so that they can curb the rampant barbarity of the Axis powers and seize several islands in the British West Indies as defense bases.

<p>Rome - The general public is increasingly influenced by the propaganda of "opportunity must not be lost" and is now preparing for an inevitable decision. Many people now believe that Italy's entry into the war is only a matter of time.

<p>Rome - According to the Rome News Agency, which is authorized by the government, although the tension still exists, there is no reason for excessive panic. It would be a mistake to draw hasty conclusions based on Foreign Minister Ciano's speech in Milan. Italy's position on the current war is still as originally decided. Italy has tried to prevent the outbreak of war and then to localize it. A large area of Europe has been preserved to this day, and the meaning of this situation does not mean that Italy can cease to consider its sovereign rights with respect to the issues caused by the naval blockade of the Mediterranean. Rome is paying close attention to the current situation, and Italy must maintain its natural aspirations, but the means used must be determined by the changes in the situation. Therefore, it seems too early to make predictions at present. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Capital City of Southern Country - Diplomatic observers here recently stated that Germany's policy in the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River Basin is to plunder the material resources of that area at any cost. Therefore, although Germany often threatens the Balkan countries with force, it also does not want to expand the war in that peninsula. If this corner of Europe suffers war, the transportation of Romanian oil and Yugoslavian food to Germany will be interrupted. At this time, all countries in Southeast Europe have taken various measures to prevent foreign expatriates from moving arbitrarily. However, the German minorities within those countries are restless and are still working for Germany. These people's attitudes have recently become increasingly arrogant, even making demands for "equal treatment" and conducting military training in secret. For example, Germans in Southern countries have suddenly developed a special interest in mechanical aspects of various sports programs and have recently purchased 10,000 motorcycles from German manufacturers. Their intention is noteworthy. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Tokyo - Abe Shinnosuke, editor-in-chief of the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun, spoke frankly and recently wrote an article criticizing the reorganization of the National Spiritual Mobilization Movement and the various living conditions within Japan, stating that since the outbreak of the China Incident, three years have passed, but Japan has not yet established what can be called a truly wartime organization, only using expedient measures to patch up the overall situation, like repairing a leaky roof. These leaks are now in danger of becoming more serious and uncontrollable. The National Spiritual Mobilization Movement was started to correct the shortcomings of our country's current system, but this movement has been carried out in an unhealthy state and has been found to be inconsistent with the actual situation. A movement that is inconsistent with the actual situation is bound to fail. Therefore, the Yonai cabinet has implemented a severe reorganization of this movement. According to the author's observation, the people who faithfully follow the lifestyle stipulated by the old Spiritual Mobilization Corps are in a very difficult situation, as these people do not hoard goods or engage in illegal transactions. Many of them eat the lowest grade of food, sweet potato porridge, and are unable to even buy a basket of charcoal, and their children die of pneumonia. The reason for this is simply loyalty to the country. On the other hand, there are people who engage in improper transactions and make huge profits, and there are many such people. This kind of contradiction in people's attitudes gives an extremely bad impression. The problem of controlling prices is difficult to deal with because it is too complicated. Some say that the Yonai cabinet will not last long, and the most serious incident it has encountered is the deadlock between the low-price policy and the distribution of materials. Last year, the government adopted a policy to make people eat seven-tenths of high-grade rice mixed with brown rice and halved the rice used for brewing sake in order to prevent a grain shortage this year. If implemented, each policy can save 50 million bushels of rice per year. However, on the other hand, this measure has caused a shortage of chicken feed, resulting in a reduction in egg production, and a shortage of pig feed, so they are slaughtered early. We are now using the rice we usually eat to feed livestock. Japanese people lack a systematic plan for important events, which is their characteristic. The price of rice has soared, and elementary school teachers have been greatly affected. Some have devoted themselves to improving the treatment of elementary school teachers, but it has been rejected by the government because it may affect other social situations. Just like adding water to wine, teachers have no choice but to reduce the materials on which their lives depend. In short, all matters are currently based on a subsistence policy, without regard for other things. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

Any steps taken by church groups to provide medical and educational facilities in Shanxi Province and other Japanese-occupied areas are supplementing the work done by the state, not replacing it. Labor MP Davidson followed up with a question, asking whether Britain's policy on this matter was one of complete neutrality. If so, he should not forget Prime Minister Churchill's remarks on neutrality. The Undersecretary replied that he did not fully understand all the implications, but what he could say was that their policy was to achieve as much improvement as possible. Labor MP Noel-Baker also asked whether any news had been received from the Chinese Embassy regarding the recent great victories claimed by the Chinese side in the war. The Undersecretary replied that the Chinese Ambassador, Guo Taiqi, had recently provided us with information of this nature. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, intersection of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road (Hours) 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM, closed Sundays The Threshold of Being a Husband How to Make Your Wife Love You Forever? ...</p>
<p>We know what a healthy and intelligent wife's only hope for her husband is. Undoubtedly, she hopes her husband can give her the truest and fullest love. In other words: a love that occupies her whole heart and soul, a united love of spirit and flesh. Indeed, when a man with abundant energy and a strong physique comes to woo his wife with ardent love, his wife cannot help but welcome him wholeheartedly! Thus, the couple's life is intimate and sweet, making her heart drunk, her emotions joyful, and making her feel the preciousness of her husband and the joy of life. If a man can always maintain the strength of his energy, so that his marital life can always be happy, then his wife will definitely love her beloved husband forever, build a happy family, and bear clever children. How happy life is!</p>
<p>But if a husband has no threshold and does not seek to increase his energy, or has even committed self-indulgence and wanton licentiousness, damaging the endocrine fluid in his reproductive glands, then his energy will inevitably decline, and he will have symptoms such as kidney deficiency, impotence, underdevelopment, thin sperm infertility, and premature aging. Then, even if he has a beautiful wife like a flower, how can he enjoy the grace of beauty? Or even be completely unable to perform his conjugal duties, ashamed to face his wife! If such a husband does not quickly seek to remedy his defects, how can his wife continue to sacrifice and waste her youth? Therefore, some become ill with depression, suffering from anemia, menstrual disorders, infertility, and breast and face decay; others have illicit affairs or elope due to sexual urges; or even righteously file lawsuits against their husbands in court, initiating divorce proceedings, which is also a common occurrence in today's society. How miserable the husband is at this time!</p>
<p>However, it is no longer difficult for a husband to seek to enhance his energy and cure his hidden diseases in today's era of flourishing medicine. He only needs to actively take the healthy animal gonadotropin preparation "Reproductive Element," and a man can produce sperm and tonify the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation in one day and night after taking it. It is especially valuable to take it continuously, which will further promote development, nourish the nerves, and thicken the blood. It is sure to cure all diseases in a short period of time, making energy exceptionally abundant. Love will achieve eternal happiness. Regular consumption by middle-aged and elderly people can further prolong life, delay aging, and rejuvenate. Only those with seminal emission need to also take "Hymid's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the seminal gate, stop leakage, and the effect will be particularly rapid. The above-mentioned good medicines have been verified and proven by famous Chinese and foreign doctors and confirmed as the only sacred medicine for strengthening sperm and tonifying the kidneys. Therefore, it has long been popular all over the world and is famous throughout the world. The major drugstores in this city, Chinese and Western, also sell it. Because of its noble quality and definite efficacy, I have cured no less than tens of thousands of patients with this agent. Therefore, I am responsible for introducing it.</p>
<p>Health and Beauty</p>
<h3 id="e42">Breast Beauty Lies in the Activeness of Early Summer <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>Fair young lady in the prime of youth,</p>
<p>Snowy skin, flowery face, and jade-like makeup,</p>
<p>Most captivating to the soul,</p>
<p>Shaking and heaving bosom.</p>
<p>The most noticeable and captivating thing on a woman's body is her pair of breasts. Look: the weather is gradually getting hotter these days, and most fashionable ladies who are at the forefront of fashion have already put on new summer clothes. The material is so thin, and the body is so full. Because the size, length, and width are moderate, the curves of their whole body are fully revealed. The one-step-three-bend movement is enough to make you lose your mind, how can you bear the pair of breasts on her chest, which stand proudly and shake her clothes, as if they are showing off to people and greeting everyone who is watching. People are not made of wood or stone, how can they not feel hot in their hearts and weak in their legs when they see such healthy and beautiful ladies? Therefore, such ladies, in today's age when women must have "health beauty," have taken full advantage of all kinds of advantages, and the result of happiness is naturally limitless!</p>
<p>But then again, if in the past, due to breast self-indulgence, menstrual disorders, excessive bleeding, nutritional disorders, or weak multiple births, the function of the ovaries was damaged, affecting metabolism, and leading to breast atrophy, thin hips, and loss of curves, then even with makeup and beautiful clothes, she is not worth a glance from a man of the times. As a result, she will be rejected everywhere, and her fate will be very tragic! The only remedy does not need to be sought elsewhere. Just take women's "Reproductive Element" three times a day, two tablets each time, for four consecutive weeks, and you will feel an increased appetite and a relaxed body. Continue to take it for another three weeks, and the atrophied breasts will rise and bulge, and at the same time, the hips will become plump, the muscles smooth, and the cheeks more delicate.</p>
<h3 id="e43">The Seriousness of Seminal Emission Syndrome <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianhui</p>
<p>Enough to bury youth and happiness, and delay the promising future of young people!</p>
<p>After a man passes the period of spring passion, seminal emission is inevitable, but if he is officially suffering from seminal emission syndrome, then its seriousness cannot be ignored. Originally, there are two types of seminal emission, physiological and pathological. Physiological seminal emission is due to the excessive production of semen in the body, or an occasional seminal emission within a few months, and there is no feeling of fatigue, dizziness, or other abnormalities the next day. This phenomenon is called overflowing sperm by doctors to distinguish it from seminal emission. If suffering from seminal emission syndrome, there will be two or three or more emissions per month, and there will be a feeling of fatigue and discomfort after the emission. When young people encounter this phenomenon, they must seek medical treatment as soon as possible. If it is not treated in time, the number of emissions will gradually increase, or even to the point where they emit semen at the sight of beauty, or even emit semen during the day, becoming sperm leakage syndrome. At the same time, due to the depletion of semen in the body, symptoms such as brain decay, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, kidney deficiency, impotence, and underdevelopment will inevitably erupt one after another. As a result, learning is not progressing, studying is unsuccessful, and the future is ruined! And it will be disliked by women, hated by wives and concubines, and the happiness of life will be lost!</p>
<p>Seminal emission is not an incurable disease. Patients only need to take the special medicine for seminal emission, "Hymid's Semen-Consolidating Tablets," and they can achieve the effect of sleeping peacefully and stopping seminal emission that night. If there are already the above-mentioned symptoms due to seminal emission, take both the gonadotropin preparation "Reproductive Element" to fundamentally cultivate and tonify the brain, kidneys, essence, and blood, and you can quickly restore perfect health. If patients can come to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment in person, we can guarantee a cure.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Ironclad Facts <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Recorded by Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nian-zeng</p>
<p>(I) Nocturnal Emission and Spermatorrhea Can Lead to Youthful Demise</p>
<p>Mr. Qin Zhi, age twenty, is from Hangzhou. His father is a real estate merchant, and the family is quite wealthy. He is currently a senior in high school at a certain middle school in M埠. Because he is naturally intelligent and excels in both character and academics, he is prone to being led astray by his cleverness. Mr. Qin developed romantic feelings early on and couldn't help but engage in love affairs with female classmates, exchanging love letters as a habit. Overwhelmed by longing, he couldn't restrain himself and committed masturbation. Despite repeated attempts to quit, he couldn't decisively break the habit, leading to weakened sperm control and subsequent spermatorrhea. Initially, it occurred two or three times a month, gradually increasing to five or six times. At first, it was due to dreams, but later it happened even without dreams. As a result, he felt mentally exhausted, suffered from memory loss and weakened brain function, insomnia, palpitations, and other symptoms. With slight exertion, he experienced lower back pain, fatigue, and weakness. His grades, once consistently in the top tier, now frequently fell below passing, posing a serious risk of dropping out or repeating a grade! During the spring break, he caught a cold and was bedridden for several days. He worried he was doomed to an early death! Therefore, he earnestly requested treatment (as narrated by the patient himself). Mr. Qin came to my clinic for treatment at the beginning of last month. After diagnosis, it was determined that his condition was indeed due to untreated spermatorrhea. I immediately instructed him to purchase two boxes of the "Hemitol Coagulant Tablets," a specific drug for spermatorrhea, and two dozen vials of the reproductive gland extract "Reproductive Essence" to take concurrently. After the spermatorrhea subsided, he continued to take "Reproductive Essence" and received Delemen's electrotherapy simultaneously. After more than a month, he felt clear-headed and energetic, and the aforementioned symptoms had completely disappeared.</p>
<p>(II) A Husband with Premature Ejaculation and Impotence Causes Suffering to His Wife</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Ke-xian, age thirty, works in the banking industry. After marriage, he developed symptoms of kidney deficiency and impotence, with occasional nocturnal emissions. As a result, marital relations were not fulfilling, or even impossible. This was not only unfulfilling for himself but also caused great suffering to his wife. He had tried various tonics and supplements on the market, but they had little effect. Recently, his body felt increasingly weak, so he sought treatment (as narrated above). After examining his condition, I instructed him to purchase three dozen vials of "Reproductive Essence" and one box of "Hemitol Coagulant Tablets," and he received daily electrotherapy injections and other medical treatments. After two months, Mr. Shen felt energized and strong, and all his symptoms had disappeared. The couple's love deepened further.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Maintaining the Shanghai Status Quo: The Attitude of All Nations Is Extremely Firm; All Support Admiral Hepburn's Opinion; European War Developments Will Not Have Any Impact <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>After Admiral Hepburn, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, arrived in Shanghai, he considered that the European war was increasingly expanding, and that European countries such as England, France, and Italy all had a portion of their defense forces in China. As a precautionary measure, Hepburn consulted with the commanders of the defense forces of various countries stationed in China to jointly maintain the status quo. Therefore, the Shanghai International Settlement would not be affected by other disputes related to the European war, which greatly pleased the people. However, Commander Takeda of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Force suddenly convened a meeting of the commanders of the British, French, American, and Italian defense forces the day before yesterday (the 20th), leading to much speculation from the outside world. A reporter from the Heiminsha Newspaper specifically inquired about this matter to those close to the International Settlement authorities and those familiar with the diplomatic situation in Shanghai. According to reports, after Admiral Hepburn repeatedly contacted and consulted with the commanders of the defense forces of various countries in Shanghai, the military commanders of various countries stationed in Shanghai unanimously and enthusiastically supported Admiral Hepburn's concern for jointly maintaining security. Even if the European war were to develop in any way, no disputes or impacts that could potentially arise would occur in Shanghai. Although the Japanese side made a similar proposal the day before yesterday and convened a meeting of the commanders of the defense forces of various countries, the commanders of the European and American stationed forces still adhered to the same principles that Admiral Hepburn had previously consulted and agreed upon. It would be unwise for any party to cause disputes in Shanghai due to the European war. Therefore, the future of the Shanghai International Settlement is secure.</p>
<p>British Commander Visits Hepburn</p>
<p>General Grasset, commander of the British Army in China, left Hong Kong on the 18th and arrived in Shanghai on the 20th. He was accompanied by four important subordinates and staff members. They are currently staying at the residence of Major General Simmons, commander of the U.S. Army stationed in Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, General Grasset, accompanied by his entourage, visited Mr. Ke Zijiewei, the new Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession. The two gentlemen had a very pleasant meeting that lasted a short time. After taking a photo together, they parted. To understand the general situation in Shanghai, General Grasset traveled by car to the U.S. Asiatic Fleet on the morning of the 21st and boarded the flagship Augusta to visit Admiral Hepburn. General Grasset will not stay in Shanghai for long. This visit is purely a routine annual inspection. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai this Friday and head north to Tianjin and then to Beijing for inspections.</p>
<p>Churchill Cables Thanks to British Overseas Chinese in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Da Mei Evening News," when former British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill took office as Prime Minister last week, various patriotic British overseas Chinese organizations in Shanghai, including the Chinese United Association, the British Women's Public Association, the British Chamber of Commerce, and the British Overseas Chinese United Association, jointly sent a congratulatory telegram to Churchill on his success. This telegram also received the full support of the heads of the four British overseas Chinese associations in the city: St. George, St. Andrew, St. Patrick, and St. David, as well as the Australian-New Zealand Association and the Canadian Association. This morning (the 22nd), Churchill replied, stating, "Humbled to receive your telegram of congratulations, deeply grateful for your earnest wishes. Churchill bows."</p>
<h3 id="e46">The Balance of Power in the Far East Has Not Changed <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The recent war in Europe has reached a serious stage, indirectly affecting the situation in the Far East. The United States has decided to use all its strength to maintain the status quo in the Far East to curb the delusions of ambitious individuals. It is rumored that the U.S. government, in view of the seriousness of the situation in the Far East, has ordered a powerful fleet stationed in Hawaii to sail to the Far East and be commanded by Hepburn. The fleet includes more than one hundred large and small warships, which will be deployed in Singapore and along the coast of China, with Singapore as the base, to prepare for any possible emergencies. According to a certain foreign professor at a well-known university in Shanghai,</p>
<p>The Balance of Power in the Far East</p>
<p>Will not be on the verge of collapse in the near future, and the development of this balance is absolutely beneficial to China. At the same time, since launching the war of aggression against China, Japan has lost its superior position as a first-class power, sinking deeper and deeper into the quagmire and unable to extricate itself. Its national policy has changed from being proactive to being passive, at a loss and not knowing what to do. Therefore, public opinion in the country has risen to criticize, with a strong sense of "Where is Japan going after all?" Therefore, Japan's influence on the balance of power in the Far East is far less obvious than before. According to the professor's observation, the</p>
<p>Important Factors</p>
<p>Affecting the balance of power in the Far East are two: (1) the Sino-Japanese War, (2) the attitude of the United States, and (3) the Soviet Union's Far Eastern policy. These three factors are intricately related and mutually constrained, allowing the status quo in the Pacific to be maintained. The United States is a democratic country, and its policies are mostly influenced by public opinion. The majority of the American public sympathizes with England and France in the current European war. However, even if the war develops in the future, they will only agree to lend money to England and France. Moreover, given the</p>
<p>Current Situation</p>
<p>The tension in the Pacific is no less than that in Europe. As for its Far Eastern policy, it emphasizes three points: (1) the United States will never recognize territories or interests obtained by violence; (2) it will use all means other than military force to pressure Japan to comply and maintain its interests in China; and (3) it will vigorously support the open door policy in China. The American public, especially those in cultural circles and those familiar with the situation in the Far East, such as Harvard University Professor Yan Lawrence, former U.S. Naval Commander in China Ya Luer, and Dr. Meng Lu, all</p>
<p>Sympathize with China's</p>
<p>Resistance and advocate for economic sanctions against Japan. However, the U.S. authorities still consider the timing immature and require further consideration. As for monitoring Japan's actions, they have always been unremitting. For example, they recently dispatched a fleet to permanently reside in Honolulu to warn Japan about maintaining the status quo in the Dutch East Indies. According to the professor, the U.S. authorities are also closely monitoring the defenses of the West Coast and Honolulu. Honolulu recently held blackout and air defense exercises.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Over One Hundred Norwegian Ships: Shipping Operations Concentrated in Shanghai: Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Manager Diverts Ships to Both Europe-Asia and America-Asia Lines <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the European War, various ships sailing on the Europe-Asia routes were significantly affected. Due to concerns about sea mines and submarine attacks, sailing was extremely cautious. British and French ships changed their routes to the Cape of Good Hope and then to Europe via the Indian Ocean. China strictly adheres to neutrality, so trade and transportation are as normal as before the war. However, the number of ships from various countries being requisitioned by their governments has decreased. As for transportation on the Pacific routes, it has suddenly become prosperous.</p>
<p>More Than Twenty President Liners Added</p>
<p>The American President Lines has added more than twenty unscheduled ships. Recently, the Yomachichi arrived in Shanghai tomorrow morning, carrying more than 3,000 tons of tobacco, galvanized iron, and paper from the United States. The company's regular mail ship, President Taft, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai this morning at 10:00 AM from Xiaoluson via Zha Port, berthing at buoys 11 and 12. Passengers will transfer to a small launch and disembark at the Customs Wharf at approximately 11:00 AM this morning. The mail ship is scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States at 9:30 PM tomorrow (the 24th). The last passenger launch will depart from the Customs Wharf at 8:00 PM tomorrow evening.</p>
<p>Regular Liners Transferred to the Atlantic</p>
<p>The regular mail ships of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. operating on the Pacific route (i.e., the America-Asia Line), such as the Pacific, the Taiping, the Taiyi, and the Sun, were transferred to the Atlantic route after the outbreak of the European War. Now, the majority of ships operating on the Europe-Asia and America-Asia routes are Norwegian ships. Recently, seeing the prosperous transportation on the America-Asia Line, the original plan of one ship per month from Shanghai to the United States has been increased to one additional ship starting next month. The new ship Tamerlane has been designated as the first additional ship and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on June 10th.</p>
<p>Norwegian Ships Resume Service on Europe-Asia Route</p>
<p>The Europe-Asia Line service was suspended after the outbreak of the European War. Now, the Norwegian ship Tricoior is the first to resume service, departing from Shanghai for Europe, stopping at Le Havre, France. It is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong, Singapore, Penang, via South Africa to French Morocco and then to Le Havre this Sunday (the 26th), without passing through the Mediterranean Sea. It is heard that the Norwegian merchant agent has more than one hundred ships, all of which will come to the Far East to participate in the Europe-Asia Line service. The Tongsheng fast ship, represented by Tongyi Shipping Company, is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong, Penang, Singapore, and other ports this week, with cargo transportation being crowded. The Zhini-Canada ship of the Java Company is scheduled to leave Shanghai at 4:00 PM today for Xiamen and Hong Kong, via various ports in Southeast Asia back to Surabaya.</p>

<p>Due to the appreciation of foreign exchange, the price of Shanghai coal has fallen sharply. Yesterday, the price of coal dust remained unchanged, but the price of coal balls fell by another six yuan per ton, bringing it to one hundred and thirty-two yuan per ton, or less than eight yuan per dan (a unit of weight). However, the selling prices in most coal ball retail stores on the market are rarely below eight yuan per dan, except for those selling at a loss. This is quite contrary to the flat-price laws promulgated by the authorities. It is hoped that the coal ball merchants will voluntarily reduce prices.</p>

<p>Da Guang She reported that all sectors of the city were extremely encouraged by the news of our side's unprecedented victory in the Henan-Hubei campaign. Various industrial and commercial groups in Shanghai sent a special telegram to the central government to congratulate them. The original text of the telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission in Chongqing and all the officers and soldiers at the front: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, for three years now, thanks to your wise command and the courageous efforts of the officers and soldiers, the enemy has sunk deep into the quagmire and is in an inextricable situation. In the recent Henan-Hubei campaign, we have won another unprecedented victory, inspiring the three armies and terrifying the enemy.

<p>Since Germany's attack on the Netherlands and Belgium and the expansion of the scope of the European war, the German official offices in Shanghai have paid close attention to the public opinion in various countries' newspapers.

<p>Yu Qiaqing initiated the handling of relief in Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui, and mortgaged his private property to raise one million yuan to purchase 200,000 bags of imported rice. However, it still felt like a drop in the bucket. He telegraphed Chairman Jiang of the Joint Office of the China, China, Communications, and Agriculture Banks, requesting that they provide a relief fund of 450,000 yuan for Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui. The Joint Office of the Four Banks has now received Chairman Jiang's order and telegraphed Yu, stating, "Shanghai Bank relays to Mr. Yu Qiaqing, we have read your telegram about purchasing imported rice to transport to Northern Jiangsu and Northern Anhui to handle relief.

<p>After the Shanghai-Wenzhou route was frequently obstructed, recently, all ships sailing to Wenzhou have been obstructed and forced to return. Yesterday, it was learned that the Deheunian Shipping Company's Feikang ship was also obstructed outside the port of Wenzhou. The company had not received any telegrams as of last night. It was also learned that there are currently two Japanese warships berthed in the waters off Wenzhou, constantly launching speedboats to patrol the estuary. It is clear that their intention is to monitor the movements of foreign ships.</p>

<p>Although the number of people is limited, they eagerly hope for foreign aid. Since Belgian Ambassador Ji Youmu issued a call, all sectors of the city and overseas Chinese in Shanghai have responded enthusiastically, donating large sums of money to cover the medical expenses of the Belgian Red Cross. However, the number of Belgian overseas Chinese in Shanghai is only a little over one hundred. Although they are doing their best to raise funds, their resources are relatively weak. Now, with the enthusiastic assistance of Chinese and foreign merchants, the soldiers at the front have no fear of a shortage of medical supplies and are wholeheartedly fighting. This is not only something that the Belgian government and foreign officials should be grateful for, but also something that the hundred or so overseas Chinese in Shanghai are praising unanimously.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The French Concession Will Thoroughly Investigate Housing Sub-renting and Establish a Special Department to Manage Rent Matters: Price Labeling of Goods Is Still Mostly Perfunctory and Evasive <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Da Mei Evening News," it has been learned that the French Concession's municipal authorities are determined to control all prices within the concession and will take stern measures to deal with illegal profiteering and the illegal collection of sub-renting when renting out housing. The French Concession Municipal Council's Price Equalization Committee is scheduled to meet on the 23rd. One of the resolutions in its minutes is to establish a special department dedicated to managing rent matters. It is hoped that the staff of the department will be selected on the 23rd, so that it can start working in early June. At that time, the department will thoroughly investigate housing rents and other expenses, first asking landlords and tenants to submit reports, and then comparing and studying the rents before the war and now. It will also conduct a thorough investigation of sub-renting and other matters that have resulted in illegal profits. It is heard that the department will work closely with the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, and the Price Equalization Committee hopes that within three weeks of the new department's establishment, it will formulate strict measures to deal with the collection of sub-renting and other fees.</p>
<p>Crack Down on the Rice Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association received a reply from the Municipal Council yesterday, stating that it deeply hopes that the method of limiting the payment period and delivery period will be effective in cracking down on speculation. It also hopes that any speculation that violates the rules will be reported at any time so that it can be cracked down on. The association immediately announced that the market should comply. The rice and grain trading methods are as follows: From the 10th of this month, regardless of domestic or imported rice (based on a unit of 160 jin), payment must be made with a bill of lading within five days of the transaction date, and the goods must be weighed and shipped within ten days. Imported rice will be paid in full according to the Yinghua book, Hong Kong rice, and domestic rice according to the original quantity on the cost sheet. However, it is feared that there may be insufficient quantity found during weighing, so the seller will deduct two jin per bag and return it to the buyer. Furthermore, to facilitate small imported rice buyers, the industry is notified that transactions of thirty to fifty bags should also be sold. However, if payment is required before weighing, the seller must provide a delivery slip.</p>
<p>Supervise Price Labeling</p>
<p>As foreign exchange appreciates, merchants continue to control prices and mostly refuse to comply with the authorities' price labeling and trading methods. Various civic groups have advised citizens to minimize consumption as much as possible and to not do business with merchants who do not label prices in order to show their resistance. It is understood that since the civic groups issued this advice, a small number of merchants have labeled prices for sales, and some have cut out advertisements and pasted them on the windows to evade responsibility. However, this is far from universal. Currently, all parties hope that the industry associations should urge member merchants to uniformly comply with the authorities' regulations, implement price labeling sales, and reduce prices according to accurate costs to benefit the common people and put industry and commerce on the right track.</p>
<p>Punish Rice Merchants</p>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council and the French Concession Municipal Council will begin implementing their legal sanctions against speculative merchants in the middle of next week. It is heard that there are ten rice merchants in the Public Concession who have repeatedly ignored warnings from the Municipal Council for failing to label the prices of their goods. Therefore, the Municipal Council has decided to file a public lawsuit against these twenty people in the middle of next week to punish them as a warning to others. The Municipal Council's Price Control Committee will also send staff to inspect and check the stores within the concession to see if the prices are labeled in full according to the committee's regulations and to review whether the labeled prices are appropriate or inflated. It is claimed that in the past, neighboring stores often labeled different prices on the same goods, with a difference of about ten cents. The Municipal Council has now ordered those who have labeled prices too high to correct them automatically.</p>
<h3 id="e59">The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Replies to the Municipal Council, Agreeing with Daylight Saving Time: The Post Office Is Likely to Be an Exception <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Public Concession Municipal Council proposing to hold a "Daylight Saving Time" campaign, advancing the clock by one hour in order to increase working hours and reduce electricity consumption, and requesting their consent. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce immediately replied, expressing its agreement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Municipal Council plans to implement Daylight Saving Time from June 1st, advancing Shanghai time by one hour. Whether this matter will be implemented will be decided within days. According to a reporter from Da Tong She, most of the public has expressed their approval of this matter. However, it is questionable whether the Shanghai Post Office will take the same approach due to its work arrangements. It is noted that the last time Shanghai implemented a similar Daylight Saving Time campaign, only the Shanghai Post Office did not implement it.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Stabilize the Value of Legal Tender, Maintain the Black Market for Foreign Exchange, Ensure That Fluctuations Are Not Too Drastic, and Prevent Manipulation by Arbitrageurs and Speculators <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>In addition to fully stabilizing the legal exchange rate, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will continue to maintain the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai for the sake of friendly trade. It has decided to ensure that the external prices do not fluctuate too drastically under the principle of not violating the natural trend of foreign exchange. It will also work with the British HSBC Bank to supply foreign exchange when the black market exchange rate falls sharply to stabilize it. If it rises too much, it will try to absorb it to replenish the fund. At the same time, it will do its best to prevent arbitrage by the Japanese puppets and manipulation by speculators.</p>
<p>Speculation and Opportunism</p>
<p>Since the soaring prices, the average poor common people have been unable to maintain their minimum standard of living. Salaried workers, with their low incomes, also feel that making a living is difficult. Seeing the profits of speculators, who earn ten thousand upon ten thousand, the desire to take a chance arises spontaneously, and they even want to make risky attempts. Therefore, the practice of "scalping" in the market has been quite active recently. Scalping is market jargon for buying goods for immediate sale and then selling them after making a small profit.</p>
<p>Should Awaken Quickly</p>
<p>There are now many people engaged in this practice, like the carp crossing the river. Now, due to the appreciation of the exchange rate, the sharp drop in gold prices, and the fall in the prices of all goods, speculators have learned a great lesson. It is heard that some speculators have gone bankrupt as a result and even committed suicide.</p>

<p>Table Tennis Friendly Match: Peicheng Defeats Soochow; Singles: 5-0, Gan Lanjun Suffers a Crushing Defeat; Doubles: Evenly Matched, Exciting Performances</p>
<p>Cao Jingyuan, the principal of Peicheng Girls' Middle School at 34 Xiaoshadu Road, and Zhu Zhiying, the director of physical education, established a table tennis research class to promote table tennis among female students. They selected the ten most outstanding female students to form a table tennis team and hired Chen Linsheng, a veteran table tennis player, as their instructor. Since then, their skills have improved by leaps and bounds. In the opening demonstration match of the Baolian Cup last Tuesday, they defeated the Baolian Women's Team 6-1 in their first appearance, achieving excellent results and proving to be a rising force among women's teams. Yesterday, the school accepted the challenge of the Soochow Women's University Table Tennis Team for a friendly match in the Peicheng Table Tennis Room, with Ding Du serving as the referee. A total of five singles matches and two doubles matches were played. Peicheng took the lead in one go, winning 5-0. In the last match, Soochow sent out its main player, Gan Lanjun, a former youth team player known for her attacking shots. Unexpectedly, Guo Huichao of Peicheng also showed her skills. Gan attacked while Guo defended, creating a spectacular display. In the third game, Guo attacked with short block shots, which Gan was unable to cope with. As a result, Peicheng won 5-0. In the doubles matches, Soochow sent out a mixed-gender team, which proved to be very strong. In the first match, they encountered fierce resistance, but ultimately relied on Lu Xiangyuan's accurate attacking shots and Luo Qingyu's effective saves to defeat Peicheng's Feng Mingyin and Guo Huichao team 21-17. In the second match, Peicheng sent out the doubles champions Gui Rongzheng and Zhang Lizhi. The two worked well together, coordinating their offense and defense. Although Gan Lanjun of Soochow was paired with the strong player Chen Ning, they were no match for Gui and Zhang's cooperation, and lost 12-21. In conclusion, Peicheng defeated Soochow Women's University by a large margin.</p>
<p>(Peicheng) (Soochow) Score</p>
<p>Zhang Xia Li Huizhen 2-1</p>
<p>Gui Rongzheng Tang Baoyu 2-0</p>
<p>Zhang Lizhi Zhu Yaohe 2-0</p>

<p>Zongjing Cup Table Tennis Semi-Finals: Qingyun Battles Huayi A; Starts Tonight at 7:30 PM</p>
<p>The Zongjing Cup Table Tennis semi-finals will begin tonight at 7:30 PM with Qingyun A vs. Huayi A. The outcome of this match may determine who wins the finals, so both sides will do their best to win. Qingyun A suffered an unfortunate defeat to Gonghua the day before yesterday and will definitely field its strongest lineup tonight to turn the tide; otherwise, it will have no hope of winning the Zongjing Cup championship and will also have difficulty winning the second or third place. However, the strength of Huayi A should not be underestimated. Players such as Zhang Ying, Fu Qifang, Liu Ziyan, and Ma Tingke are all top players of their time. The match will be intense and exciting, as expected. Referee: Shen Zhu Kuisheng; Location: Liangxi Billiards Room.</p>

<p>Commercial News and Finance: Foreign Exchange Rates Tighten, Prompting Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday's Foreign Exchange Market Conditions</p>
<p>The listed prices for all currencies remained unchanged. In the unofficial market, the British and American exchange rates fluctuated. Operators believed that the unfavorable development of the European war had a negative impact on the market, so bearish sentiment was not eliminated by a temporary increase in foreign demand. In other words, the market was prone to selling when prices tightened. In the morning, the exchange rate fell sharply by 0.01075, leading to a weakening of both the British and American currencies after the opening. Subsequently, heavy selling by speculators bolstered the market, but soon after, Macauley aggressively bought up £100,000 worth of British gold. It was said that this was on behalf of the Equalization Fund, causing sellers to temporarily retreat and the potential for tightening increased. The initial call rate remained at 0.0625, while the American exchange rate was seen at 5.375 yuan. However, Chinese merchants returned to engage in heavy selling, especially in the futures market for the American exchange rate. As a result, the market tightened again at the close. In the end, British gold closed at 4.0625 shillings to the yuan, and the American exchange rate closed at 5.53125 yuan, with the British currency weakening by 0.078125 and the American currency slightly strengthening by 0.03125. The futures and spot markets moved in the same direction.</p>
<p>Macauley's Appetite is Very Strong</p>
<p>In the morning, the London near-term was down 0.0615, the far-term was up 0.0625, and the silver price remained unchanged. The London raw gold price remained fixed. The exchange rate of British currency against the American currency was unchanged, against Shanghai it decreased by 0.015625, and against the French currency it did not change. The American currency decreased against the British currency by 0.01075, against Shanghai it decreased by 0.01, and against the French currency it decreased by 0.000875. The central listed prices for various currencies remained the same. The bank's opening selling price for spot currencies in the morning was 4.09375 shillings per yuan for British gold and 5.40625 yuan for the American exchange rate. Compared with the evening close of the previous day, the British currency weakened by 0.03125 and the American currency strengthened by 0.09375, due to the sharp drop in the exchange rate. After the opening, Chinese merchants generally sold, and the market stabilized and strengthened. At that time, speculators sold May American exchange rates to foreign firms for 5.46875 yuan, and then for 5.53125 yuan, while foreign firms sold spot British gold to Macauley for 4.1875 shillings. HSBC's listed price was unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced to be lower by 0.005. Later, Macauley's appetite was very strong, absorbing spot British gold at a call rate of 4.15625 shillings. Moreover, due to the scarcity of sellers, the position suddenly felt insufficient, and the situation was very tight. The American exchange rate weakened to 5.375 yuan, and the British exchange rate even reached 4.0625 shillings. However, Chinese merchants sold again when they saw the high price, and the situation soon loosened. It is estimated that speculators sold May American exchange rates to foreign firms for 5.5 yuan, and June American exchange rates for 5.25 to 5.3125 yuan. The noon close was still flat. As a result, British gold closed at 4.140625 shillings and the American exchange rate closed at 5.53125 yuan. This month's British gold was 4.125 shillings and the American exchange rate was 5.5 yuan. June's British gold was 3.96875 shillings and the American exchange rate was 5.25 yuan. Compared with yesterday's closing price, the spot British gold increased by 0.078125, and May and June both strengthened by 0.09375, while the American exchange rate was uniformly weaker by 0.03125 in both the futures and spot markets.</p>
<p>Hong Kong American Exchange Rate Fluctuates Greatly</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 22nd (Wednesday) The exchange market opened steadily this morning, but the American exchange rate fluctuated. The British exchange rate showed no changes in spot or futures markets. The American exchange rate sharply decreased by 0.08125 to 19.625 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate decreased by 1 yuan to 359 yuan (yesterday afternoon it was 360 yuan). The Japanese exchange rate also tightened by 3 yuan to 83.5 yuan. At 10:00 AM, the American exchange rate slightly loosened by 0.00625 to 19.6875 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate decreased by 2 yuan to 357 yuan. At 10:20 AM, it was still fluctuating. The Shanghai exchange rate increased by 1 yuan to 356 yuan. At 10:30 AM, it was still unstable.

The Shanghai exchange rate rose again by 1 yuan to 359 yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin British and American Currencies Both Weaken</p>
<p>Tianjin, 22nd (Wednesday) The exchange market opened with instability this morning. The spot British exchange rate tightened by 0.00625 to 3.0625 pence, and the spot American exchange rate also weakened by 0.00625 to 4.9375 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 2.5 yuan to 114 yuan. The unofficial market for "Joint Currency" was slightly lower by 0.15 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies Encounter Another Setback</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the British and American gold pounds ultimately fall again by two yuan along with the gold price. The supply of British gold notes was also strong, and the price fell by one yuan. The American gold notes were initially flat, but then, due to the general perception that the pound price had fallen sharply by more than a dime and that American stocks had also fallen, indicating unfavorable conditions for the Allied forces, various parties strongly increased their supply. The price once retreated to 17.6 yuan, but then the Equalization Fund resumed its purchase of foreign exchange, so it rose again to 18.4 yuan, but eventually retreated again to 17.7 yuan, a decrease of 0.45 yuan compared to the previous day. In addition, there was also a supply of Hong Kong notes, French francs, Singapore dollars, Annam piastres, and Philippine pesos, and the market prices all weakened. The supply and demand for Japanese yen and Korean won were balanced, and the market prices remained stable. The former remained at 1.08 yuan, and the latter remained at 0.92 yuan.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate for Bills and Discounts Rises</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange rate bills and notes slightly increased. Throughout the morning and afternoon, the rate was consistently between 115 yuan and 120 yuan per thousand yuan, an increase of two yuan. The interest rate for the Qianye Guild remained unchanged, with both the morning and afternoon markets quoting 0.26 yuan.</p>
<p>Banks Close for Interest Calculation; Staff Members Currently Processing</p>
<p>Mr. Ying Yongyu of the banking sector stated that since the outbreak of the war, the floating deposits of various banks in the city have increased, and the number of current accounts has surged. The interest calculation procedures at each term (June 20th and December) are cumbersome, and there is a real need for a holiday.

<p>Gold Market Fluctuates; Briefly Breaks Through the 6,000 Yuan Mark, But Ultimately Falls Again Due to War</p>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for cash gold saw an increasingly wide range of fluctuations, the result of competition between new bulls and bears. However, the general sentiment was still influenced by the deteriorating European war situation, leading to a tendency to sell, so the price ultimately fell by 70 yuan. The opening price in the morning was 5,750 yuan, a decrease of 80 yuan from the previous day. Furthermore, due to selling by money exchange businesses and banks, the price fell to a low of 5,660 yuan. Subsequently, the exchange market reported tightening, and buying sentiment suddenly rose, especially with aggressive bidding by new bulls, such as the continued purchase by the Hong Kong gang, which was very strong. In addition, gold shops and banks were also absorbing, and the price briefly broke through the 6,000 yuan mark, reaching a high of 6,030 yuan. However, this was short-lived, and the price soon fell back. At that time, the foreign exchange market weakened, and gold shops, banks, and retail investors continuously sold, and the price was only 5,740 yuan. The closing price was also only 5,760 yuan, a decrease of 70 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, there was no trading heard outside the market. The total transaction volume for the half-day was about 3,000 taels. Jewelry stores ultimately quoted a small increase of ten yuan for gold ornaments. Customs gold and other prices remained fixed.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Falls by 70 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially down 80 yuan because the exchange rate had fallen sharply, but the American exchange rate soon reversed and loosened, making it difficult to boost confidence. The opening price was 5,750 yuan, with gold shops trading ten taels. Subsequently, due to the tendency of money exchange businesses to sell and a certain bank's urgent selling, the price fell another 90 yuan. The interbank trading price for ten taels was only 5,660 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange market tightened, and a certain bank was the first to stop selling and aggressively buy, and the price rose again. Soon after, buying sentiment gradually increased, with securities firms and gold shops competing to aggressively buy, and the Hong Kong gang also actively participated. Before long, the price soared past the 6,000 yuan mark, with gold shops buying 30 taels from banks for 6,030 yuan. Unexpectedly, the market suddenly turned at this time, and selling sentiment rose again. Gold shops and banks rushed to sell at the high price, and the exchange market weakened again. Many retail bulls sold when they saw the situation. By the time of the close, the price had fallen back to 5,740 yuan. Later, securities firms sold ten taels to banks, making the noon closing price 5,760 yuan. As a result, the price fell by 70 yuan compared to the previous day, with a range of 370 yuan in half a day. The selling price of this brand of cash gold by gold shops was more than ten yuan higher than the unofficial price, and the buying price was reduced by thirty yuan. The current bid gold price was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Quoted at a Small Increase of Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Initially, the selling price of jewelry gold per tael by the Datonghang was still suspended at 600 yuan. However, at 9:30 AM, it was quoted at a small increase of ten yuan. At the same time, it returned to ten yuan higher at 9:50 AM. At 10:10 AM, it returned to ten yuan lower. At 10:40 AM, it fell back to ten yuan. At 11:45 AM, it was quoted at a small increase of ten yuan. There were no changes after that. As a result, it was quoted at a small increase of ten yuan, with Datonghang changing the suspended price to 590 yuan. The new Datonghang price was the same as the upper price, and the buying price was reduced by about thirty yuan.</p>
<p>Securities: A Gloomy Wednesday for Foreign Stocks Today</p>
<p>Yesterday's securities unofficial market turned bearish again. After falling for two consecutive days, it fell by about one yuan. Initially, there were rumors in the concession, which were nothing more than unfounded fears. In the afternoon, rumors suddenly spread that both the United States and Italy had joined the shame group, and the world would become a furnace, and people's hearts were again uneasy. In fact, there was no problem in the concession, and the United States and Italy joining the war, although expected, had nothing to do with government bonds. There were those who came out as bulls, and those who compensated as bears, each causing confusion. The market should improve today. Yesterday, Jiufeng consistently sold, while Hongkang bought. Yichang consistently bought in both the morning and afternoon. Defu bought more in the afternoon, and there were more sellers. Shunkang, Yitai, Renchang, Houdale, and Maole, especially No. 38, were the most eager to sell, so the market was even weaker in the afternoon, falling by 0.5 to 0.65 yuan compared to the previous day. The total transaction volume was more than 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 59.80 59.40 59.40 Down 0.60</p>
<p>Unified B 51.80 51.15 51.25 Down 0.65</p>
<p>Unified C 50.00 49.40 49.40 Down 0.50</p>
<p>Unified D 48.50 47.80 47.90 Down 0.65</p>
<p>Unified E 49.90 49.55 49.55 Down 0.60</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Bank of China were traded at a price of 73 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's public stock market could be named "Gloomy Wednesday." The brokers of the public industry association could not recall a day in their memories that was the same as this scene. The sorrow and desolation can be described as extreme. Stock prices have all become secondary matters, and the only point of anxiety in the public mood is the serious development of the war in northwestern France the day before yesterday. "Giger will be miserably defeated" was the general expectation the night before, and the fact turned out to be the case. At the opening, the public showed extreme indifference to the market. There was much to be said for the actions of the buyers, but the power of the sellers ultimately prevailed, and the closing price was the lowest of the day. Among rubber stocks, the stocks of various Dutch Indian companies suffered a serious blow again. The English-Chinese stock fell from 25.5 to 21 yuan, which is one example.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Tuesday) The listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt remained stable today, and there were no changes in the prices of various bonds.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Tuesday) The listed market prices of British companies in the Far East rose slightly today after consecutive falls in bank stocks. HSBC's London-registered shares rose by half a pound to 78.5 pounds, and Hong Kong-registered shares rose by 1.5 pounds to 81.5 pounds. The rest remained flat.</p>
<p>Shahua: In order to Protect Losses, Flower Shops Sell Futures Yarn; Current Loan Hong Kong Gang Procurement Still Good</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, and the trend is slightly stable. Because the actual demand is not bad, people's hearts have changed to stability. However, the cotton industry situation is still weakening due to the increasingly serious European war. Therefore, flower shops in the current yarn market have successively sold futures to protect losses. As a result, the table is still feeling loose.</p>
<p>The morning opening of the current yarn was due to the rise in gold in the afternoon of the previous day, and the good face was remembered. Continuing the aftershocks, the price of 20-count Shuangma yarn was 1,330 yuan, rising to 45 yuan. Soon, the flower shop sold and recovered to 1,290 yuan. Then, because the Hong Kong gang's</p>
<h3 id="e63">A Great Change in People's Hearts: Younger Brother Plots Against Elder Brother; Unable to Make Up for Misappropriated Funds, Evil Friends Incite a Murderous Intent; Fortunately Discovered, All Criminals Are Arrested <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, customs in Shanghai have changed drastically, morals have declined. The Zhou brothers' parricide case has not yet completely concluded, and now another case of a younger brother plotting to murder his elder brother has occurred. Fortunately, the police station discovered it early, allowing it to be solved. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Zhuang Renjun, a man from Dacha (大塲),</p>
<p>over thirty years of age, operates the Zhengfeng Herbal Medicine Store at number 419 Hankou Road. His younger brother, Zhuang Debao (22 years old), also works at Zhengfeng, responsible for sales and collecting payments. Recently, Zhuang Renjun discovered that his brother and another salesman, Meng Zhenhua (22 years old) from Nanxiang, had jointly embezzled collected funds amounting to several thousand yuan. He sternly ordered them to find a way to repay the money before the end of the old lunar year's Dragon Boat Festival. Meng and Zhuang Debao, finding it impossible to repay the money at once, conceived an evil plan. Meng then said to Xu Jin, "Your brother disregards brotherly affection and insists on the return of the funds. But you and I both</p>
<p>cannot raise huge sums of money.</p>
<p>The matter will inevitably end badly. It would be better for us to murder your brother. Not only can you avoid being oppressed, but you can also rise to take over your brother's business, so that you and I can enjoy freedom from now on," and other sweet-talking words. Zhuang Debao, upon hearing this, disregarded brotherly affection and readily agreed. Meng then returned to his hometown of Nanxiang and recruited four fellow villagers: Qiang Yunsheng, Sun Baokui, Teng Baozhong, and Chen Rongqian. They came to Shanghai and established a base in room 235 of the Jincheng Hotel at 570 Hankou Road, as a place for Qiang and the others to stay. At the same time, they instructed Qiang and the others to carry out</p>
<p>the assassination of Zhuang Renjun.</p>
<p>After the matter was completed, a reward of 400 yuan would be paid. To gain trust, Zhuang and Meng first paid 150 yuan. They also agreed to take action on the night of the 19th of the month. However, that night, Zhuang Renjun, for some reason, did not return home. Qiang and the others waited for a long time but did not arrive, so they returned empty-handed. As a result, they decided to go again at 10 p.m. on the 21st. But at 7:45 p.m. that afternoon, this secret was suddenly</p>
<p>detected by the Laozha Police Station.</p>
<p>They immediately rushed to room 235 of the Jincheng Hotel and arrested Zhuang, Meng, Qiang, Sun, Teng, and Chen. The 150 yuan reward that Zhuang and Meng had prepaid was also seized at the same time. After being interrogated, they also went to number 27 Xiaohualong (小花) Road, Zhejiang Road, and arrested Meng's lover, Chen Fengzhen (21 years old, a waitress in the Yong'an Rooftop Garden) from Changshu (常熟). Weapons prepared for the assassination were seized, including two pistols and ten bullets. Yesterday, they were all</p>
<p>transferred to the First Special Court,</p>
<p>Criminal Division 1. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi briefly explained what happened. Because this case still needs investigation, he requested a postponement of the hearing. Chief Judge Qian Hongye of the Criminal Division briefly questioned each defendant. Meng Zhenhua fully confessed without hesitation, while Zhuang Debao was evasive. The court then ordered that they be returned to custody together and the hearing be postponed.</p>

<p>The Yonghe Refinery on Yanping Road announced its closure in September of last year and commissioned lawyer Peng Xuehai to liquidate it. Recently, Zhu Chunrong, the manager of the factory, Zhu Qinzou, the assistant manager, and all the shareholders, commissioned lawyer Mao Xianshen to sue the chairman of the board, Wang He'an, and the liquidation lawyer, Peng Xuehai, jointly for</p>
<p>breach of trust and embezzlement in the First Special Court. According to their statement, the two defendants, using their positions as chairman of the board and liquidation lawyer, without the consent of all shareholders, arbitrarily sold the entire assets of the factory to the Liming Factory and privately unsealed the factory seal that was kept in the custody of lawyer Peng Xuehai, and signed a</p>
<p>transfer contract with the Liming Factory. According to the contract, the price was 20,000 yuan, but according to a secret informant to the plaintiffs and the board meeting minutes of Liming Factory, Liming Factory spent as much as 38,000 yuan. In addition to 20,000 yuan as the price, the rest was privately embezzled by the two defendants. The plaintiff, Zhu Chunrong, as manager, could not remain silent and, in addition to</p>
<p>refusing to sign, also published a statement declaring his position. The defendants ignored it, so he filed this lawsuit to investigate, etc. The court approved the statement and Judge Jiang Shuzi summoned the two defendants to court for questioning. They denied any breach of trust or embezzlement. The court, considering that the case was clear, announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment.</p>

<p>Wu Dekui and Xu Decheng, Chinese detectives of the Gordon Road Police Station, received a tip the night before last that a large number of human traffickers were hiding in room 25 of the Jiangxin Hotel on Shanxi Road. After receiving the report, they led detectives Hao Shangqin and others to arrest them at the address. On the spot, they arrested the suspected traffickers Tong Rende (owner of the Shanghai Light Guide Agency), Zhu Yuxing, Hong Honglai, Wu Jincheng, Zhang Wei's wife, Zhu Sun's wife, and six others, and rescued ten victims, girls between the ages of seventeen and twenty: Mao Aidi, Mao Juzhen, Li Qingmei, Lu Didi, Zhou Baiyun, Lu Zhou's wife, Yuan Genbao, Li Qingxia, Chen Cuiying, Wang Manna, and others. They seized fourteen passes and more than ten loan receipts. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., they were sent to the First Special Court and requested to be detained. Judge Fei opened the Criminal Division 3 for trial. According to the victims, the defendants Tong Rende and others initially tricked us into working as guides at his Shanghai Light Guide Agency. The money they lent us was all written on receipts to him. Now he is issuing passes and forcing us to follow him to Nanjing to engage in prostitution. We don't agree to go. He took out the loan receipts and asked us for money. There was no way, so we had to obey him. Now we beg the judge to protect us according to the law. The court verified the confessions and briefly questioned the defendants, then ordered them to be remanded in custody and the hearing postponed for seven days. The victims were temporarily handed over to the Women and Children Relief Association for care.</p>

<p>The Shooting</p>
<p>Yesterday at 5:00 p.m., after classes were dismissed at Minli Girls' Middle School, he had an appointment with a friend and planned to meet at the Gujiazhai Garden. When Lu stepped out of the school gate at 612 Route Lafayette and headed towards the Gujiazhai Garden, four unfamiliar men suddenly blocked his path at the intersection of Route Molliere and Route Massenet. Without asking any questions, one of them pulled out a pistol and fired three shots at Lu, hitting him in the left shoulder. He fell to the ground in great pain. At that time, several Western children were playing by the roadside and shouted "Catch the thief!" upon hearing the gunshots. The assailant, realizing the situation was bad, ran away. By the time the detectives arrived, the assailants were gone. Lu, because his injuries were not severe, hired a rickshaw and went to the Guangci Hospital for treatment.

<h3 id="e68">Man and Woman Conspire in Fraud; Continued Hearing Yesterday, Bail Revoked <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zongtao, a young man from Guangdong, previously hired lawyers Xu Wufang and Lu Ronggan to sue Xi Shaofen, a woman from Nanhui who was formerly a section member of the two railway bureaus, for conspiring with Wu Jinru and Feng Ruizhang to jointly defraud 37,300 yuan in checks. Judge Li has been hearing the case. Because Xi claimed that the money given to Feng was a Jincheng Bank check borrowed from Zhang Binren, who worked at the Ministry of Railways, the court postponed the hearing. The hearing continued yesterday afternoon. The plaintiff was absent due to illness and was represented by lawyers Xu and Lu. The defendants Feng and Xi also arrived in court with their defense lawyers. When questioned, Feng stated that he had obtained more than ten checks from Liang and had returned them all on the due date. Only one check for 500 yuan had not been cleared by the bank. As for the checks for more than 30,000 yuan, he had already given them to Xi Shaofen and had only received a check for 15,000 yuan in the name of Zhang Binren from Xi. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer Xu stated that it had been discovered that Feng Ruizhang had his own check at the China Reclamation Bank and did not use the plaintiff's check, which showed malicious intent to defraud. After questioning, the court adjourned the hearing to a later date. Xi was released on her original bail, Feng was released on a written guarantee of 15,000 yuan, and was taken into custody due to lack of bail.</p>
