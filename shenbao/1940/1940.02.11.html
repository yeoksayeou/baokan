<p>社評</p>
<h3>上海的今年春節</h3>
<p>不問誰何，假定他對於人生，對於社會機能，並不過於視如機械，則國家正朔儘是國家正朔，但仍不會過於道貌儼然的抹煞春節，過於輕蔑春節的意義。當然，存心抗違政令而變本加厲的提倡春節，那是不必要的，且是要不得的。</p>
<p>在春節期間，整個社會沿着習慣而休業；因此名業人士同時都在假期之中；成為睡眠狀態中的社會，成為特別消費的季節。觸目皆是的；煥然一新的春聯，善頌善禱；紅男綠女，結隊成行；遊戲塲宣吿客滿，通衢大道亦宣吿了人滿，平時習慣成性的動輒詬誶，甚至揮拳，這幾天却信口說來的祝福，彬彬有禮的打恭作揖；終年猙獰的惡姑，這幾天也許有一絲笑容；終年冷酷的鴇婦，這幾天也許有一些溫情；街頭乞兒，當然這幾天容易碰得臨時小小慈善家；終年牛馬，亦得稍紓喘息。總之，春節有此種種自然的賜予；不問誰何，當不抹煞這些賜予亦自有其價値，就得承認春節竟然普遍的造就了一時生趣。何况昨日證實華軍正式克復蕭出，更為春節添加不少風光！</p>
<p>但是還得懷念：抗戰之中，前綫將領士兵，冒風冒雪，流汗流血，他們為丁爭取國族的生存，為了爭取最後的勝利，他們無暇享受春節自然的賜予啊！　的存亡，族的生死，戰的勝敗，不是前綫將領士民獨有的責任；流汗流血，不是他們獨負的義務。最後勝利的來臨，是他們的血汗生命所換來，而勝利後的一切却又不是他們獨得的享受！懷念及此，一般人應如何渡此春節？</p>
<p>現在中國當局正在提倡廣泛的「春禮勞軍運動，」意在藉此表示後方人民對於前綫將士的懷念，而加以慰勞；這是名分，這是義務，決不能認為應時的點綴。蔣委員長以身作則，以鉅額代金，派員送交春禮勞軍會，用以嘉勉抗戰將士；各地人民也都羣起倣效，紛紛響應。上海自國軍西移以後，已成為孤島，孤島華人當然有種種不能同於內地之處；但血統同，良知同。國族榮枯與抗戰的利害關係完全相同。因此之故，此决「春禮勞軍運動，」亦起而響應，組織徵募委員會，向工商各界勸募，額定慰勞代金五十萬元，由各業公會分別攤認，以貢獻國家。以我們的觀感所及，以為以上海工商百業的規模，以去年畸形的特別繁榮，則五十萬之數，實嫌其小；又以為各業攤派，自易一呼而集，但其意義却為上海每一華籍居民所應分担；則安得於各業攤派五十萬元之外，更見華籍居民的自動捐輸，踴躍報効，使成績遠踰預期。</p>
<p>我們並不否認春節是一個佳節，我們並不反對春節的活氣，但孤島居民久蒙醉生夢死之譏，又有許多人蒙了發國難財的惡名，則應如何節省春節期間一部分的消費貢獻之於抗戰，貢獻之於國家，則成績所示，春節雖玩着鑼鼓花砲，更見其有聲有色了！</p>

<h3>美遠東政策　立場始終不變　所謂「東亞新秩序」　與門戶開放不相容</h3>
<p>華盛頓　日本衆院連日開會時、若干議員曁有田外相均曾涉及華府九國公的片面廢止問題、此間政界人士聞悉之餘、咸皆處以鎭靜、幷謂不問日本議員如何失言或發出威脅、美國對於遠東時局所推行之政策、仍如一九三八年十二月三十一日送達日本照會中之所述、絕不有所變更、質言之、美國依據華府九國公的而在中國所享有之權利、仍當加以維護、不容日本以片面行動破壞之、此種立塲迄今依然、幷無變化、又况一九一一年美日兩國商的失效之後、美國政府已脊隨時以禁運辦法加諸日本、其對於遠東時局、自更可處之泰然、此在美國官塲人士對於日本衆院辯論、不願多所批評、僅謂此乃該國內政問題、美國政府立塲如何、寗願由駐日大使格魯就近向日本政府當局隨時加以說明、而不欲由此間官方公開發表聲明、藉免在輿論方面引起反響、而使日美兩國緊張局勢愈益加甚云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>東京　日衆院之一明年度豫算審議日期、決定如下、二月五日至十二日為豫算總會質疑、十三至十九日為各分科會質疑、二十日為各派討議決定、二十一日上午為分科會決定、同日下午為豫算總會決定、故衆議院全體會議之提出預算案、當在二十二日、（五日同盟）</p>
<p>東京　今晨藏相櫻內、在衆院豫算委員會全體會議時、對於一九四〇—四一年度四·四六〇·〇〇〇·〇　〇元對華戰事特別軍事預算、有所說明、謂下屆特別軍事預算、計陸軍特別經費二·九七三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、海軍特別經費七三七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、及準備金七五〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、大的上述四·四六〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元中、將有三·六七三·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、須發行公債以募集之、六〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元由總收入項下撥付之、一五八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、由因華北事件而徵收之特稅應付之、其餘則由其他收入提用之云、藏相又提出補充預算約十一項、第一項旨在增加海陸軍人家屬撫卹費、藏相允撙節政府各部之經費、俾移作各補充預算經費、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　根據大藏省所發表日本於事變發生以來、至今次議會為止所提出之臨時軍費預算統計、總額達一百六十四億五千五百萬元、該項之財源一百六十四億九千一百萬元之財源超過額、為三千三六萬元、又大藏省於十日衆議院豫算總會中發表中國事變以來三年間、政府資金支付超過總額為、「昭明十二年」十二億八千五百六萬六千元、「昭和十三年」四十七億一千四百三十八萬七千元、「昭和十四年」五十三億三千四百廿六萬二千元、近年政府支出在急激增加中、去年中之總額、比之事變發生之當年竟達四倍强、（十日同盟電）</p>
<h3>戰時增稅計畫　議員反對甚力</h3>
<p>東京　昨日衆院開會時、議員對政府所提出關於戰時增稅其中含有許多爭點之議案三十二件、抨擊甚力、質問者均恐增稅之後、工業生產之擴張將受打擊而陷於危境、蓋今日彼等至不願見此種事態發生也、昨日舉行秘密會議時、企畫廳之解釋政府物質動員計畫後、顯已引起　更尖銳之爭點矣、按此項計畫之內容、迄今未經宣露、據「日日新聞」載稱、衆院議員昨日感覺企畫廳廳長關於物質動員計畫之解釋過於抽象、而不能令人滿意、遂止繼續進行討論、而要求今日再開秘密會議、由政府代表說明此項計畫之煎要細則、諸議員堅稱、該計與龐大之一百萬萬元預算案有關、而不能分立、故彼等必須先知其主要內容、然後始能從事討論預算案、庶不能茫無頭緖、政友會總裁兼衆院預算委員會主席於昨日秘密會議後、要求政府作詳明之解釋、而勿過事秘密、據稱、今日之主要問題、為預算案之支出是否能予增高、所需之材料是否能以指撥之款購之、又曰、「吾人今非請求政府宣露國防秘密、吾人所欲知者為整個工業、並注重預期所能應用之村料、是否足以彌補龐大驚人之預算案一問題、余希望政府從大處着想釋明一切、使國民較為滿意、今日各事皆包藏於秘密之中、如此簡單之事而亦守秘密、則國家將如何安渡目前之緊急時代、」按據大藏省宣稱、關於籌款一節、所許於三月三十一日止之本財政年度內發行之公債五·九二五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、現尙有三·〇七八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元未經發行、上屆財政年度內所許發行之公債共一·七〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元、巳經栘至本財政年度、大約半因缺乏必要之材料、致未能動用撥定之款之故、因是衆院乃要求政府對物質動員計畫作較詳細之釋明也、報知新聞今日載有照片一幅、示明藏相在衆院演說時議員七人安然在其席上作假寐狀、並加註語曰、「請議長注意此無意中映得之照片、要知五萬萬元之增稅法案、即在此瞌睡中提出者也、」（九日路透）</p>
<h3>滇越鐵路被炸事　法對日提抗議　美國視為貨運動脈　格魯大使促日注意</h3>
<p>東京　頃悉法國駐日大使亨利、現向日外相有田提出關於日機星期四日與星期六日轟炸滇越鐵路事之抗議、按星期四日之空襲中、法人傷亡五名、內有婦人二、與小孩一、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>重慶　昆明傳來關於上星期四日滇越鐵路被炸事之最近消息、已證實被炸三列車係屬慢車、並非「米許林」快車、列車機頭被炸毀、致延燒客車數輛、傷亡人數或達二三百人、以目前所知殞生者巳逾一百十人、某法籍鐵路雇員及其母子喪生之訊、尤為可慘、彼等姓名至今仍未宣布、據目擊該慘禍者稱、被炸死傷者外、其他死於蒸氣火燄沸水與土崩者為數頗夥、滇越客車常以頭等與二等車接近機頭、故死傷者均為外人與中上階級之華人、華方消息稱、是日中日飛機在開源（譯音）上空發生空戰數次、擊落日轟炸機一架云、但此訊尙未經官方證實、（五日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　美駐日大使格魯上星期明確通吿日本政府、謂美國對於日機轟炸滇越鐵路、頗為關切、格魯向日政府通吿、雖不能視為正式抗議、然因日美兩國關係早巳緊張、故該項通吿意味深長、據云、格魯通吿日本政府、謂美國政府視滇越路為輸往美國貨物之交通動脈、並為美國僑民及外交官員旅行要道、記者獲悉、美國以同樣通吿、促起法國外交部之注意、（四日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　外務省發言人今日招待新聞記者時聲稱、駐日法大使亨利昨向外務次官谷正之提出正式牒文、抗議二月二日飛機轟炸滇越鐵路、致死傷法人若干名、外次當時答稱、日飛機之出此、純為軍事上與戰略上之必要、發言人繼稱、如法人因此殞生、日政府對此不勝扼腕、日政府凖備取合理公正之道、以賠償第三國人民喪失生命之損失、日政府對法政府之抗議、於繼續研究後、或將予以書面之答覆云、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>日願與菲印荷屬　訂不侵約　獨不提及安南　顯有侵越野心</h3>
<p>東京　日外相有田昨日向議會聲稱、日本願與菲列濱荷屬東印度印度　或任何南洋國家、締結互不侵犯公約、但以各該國有意與日本締結該項公約為條件、有田於答覆日本與荷屬東印度締結互不侵犯公約之質問時聲稱、日本之南進政策、並不懷有領土野心、然僅欲開發南洋各國之資源而巳、渠稱、日本與菲列濱東印度及印度締結互不侵犯公約頗為合理云、（十日合衆電）</p>
<p>重慶　有田昨在日本議會中建議、與菲列賓印度及南洋各國簽訂不侵條約、而不及安南一點、此間熟悉時事之觀察家認為日本即將準備對安南採取侵略行動之表示、蓋日本若能征服富有之安南、則可為其南進政策奠定强固之基礎也、再則目日本佔領海南島新南羣島　洲島及最近侵入廣西之後、自覺安南業巳入其掌中、日本之野心、顯在切斷美國英國荷蘭對於法國之援助也、（十日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>日軍事深陷泥淖　求和心切　米內痴心妄想　盼蔣汪能合作</h3>
<p>東京　日政府定於十日在衆議院預算會議開秘密會、說明日政府與「中國新政府」訂立之和平條件、及其他處理事變之諸問題（九日同盟電）</p>
<p>東京　日本首相米內今日在議會中表示、日本盼望重慶方面之領袖、以個人資格加入在精衛之「新中央政府」、即蔣委員長亦所歡迎、按自中日戰事爆發以後、日方之負責人物始終表示不願與蔣委員長發生何種關係、今米內此種表示、可謂中日戰爭爆發以來之第一次、米內此項表示、乃於答覆議員窪井道義質問時所發表者、米內又謂、日本對於第三國亦可在華作相當限度之讓步、唯須與「東亞新秩序」之精神相符合、假若第三國有意妨礙日本在華之進行、則日本決取堅決態度、（七日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　此間官方對於米內昨日在日本議會中所作盼望重慶方面各領袖加入在精衛之組織、並謂蔣委員長若能加入、亦所歡迎等語、認為「痴心妄想」、完全不値得批評、米內此項表示、若非對於自由中國之實情毫無了解、即為意在欺騙日本之民衆、否則即為日本切於求和妥協之表示、蓋日本政府於兩年前曾獲日皇之准許、對於蔣委員長決計不再有所交涉、今米內明白表示歡迎蔣委員長與注合作、顯霹業已不能維持已往立塲也、（八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　關於東京所傳日本不反對蔣委員長加入有汪精衛氏在內的政府一說、昨有人向倫敦某負責發言人詢問駐華英大使寇爾在重慶與蔣委員長談話時曾吾提及此事、該發言人答稱、倫敦尙未得重慶所討論事件之情報、惟覺此種建議未必提及、蓋能應付此種建議者厥為重慶政府、而重慶政府已屢次明白表示其對於與日合作之態度也云、（九日路透電）</p>

<p>東京　陸相畑俊六大將頃在衆議院宣稱、日蘇兩國自於去歲九月十六日簽訂諾蒙亨休戰協定以還、蘇聯與「滿洲交界處所、仍不斷發生「非法行動」、一切幷未盡如人意（七日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>淺間丸案　英日妥協　被扣德人九名　英允移交與日</h3>
<p>東京　日外相有出今日在貴院聲稱、英政府對於淺問丸案、抱和平解決之旨願、故於二月五日來牒中允將從「淺間丸」捕去之德人交出九名、其交出日期與地點、由雙方議定之、日政府尙不以交出一郁份德人為滿足、將繼續要求英方交出其他十二德人云、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　昨晚英國上下兩院皆對於淺間丸案有所詰問、首相張伯倫與外相哈立法克斯在答復時、作同樣之言論、外相在上院言及英日兩政府交換公文後聲稱、「淺間丸」德籍船客二十一人被捕後、調査其訓練與經歷、發現其中有若干人、在比較上不適宜於軍役、英政府一方面保留其法律上權利、一方面準備釋放德人九名、此九人行將交與適當的日本航業當局、同時日政府已訓令其航業公司、今後不得准許隸屬軍隊或有此嫌疑之交戰國人民乘坐日輪、英政府仍維持其在此事中法律地位之見解、然料類似淺間丸案之事件、將來可免復作云、（七日路透社電）</p>

<h3>美國推進和平外交　與各中立國政府開始接洽　調整經濟及縮减軍備兩事　美國務卿發表談話</h3>
<p>華盛頓　國務卿赫爾昨夜發表書面談話稱、美國鑒於各中立國皆顯有亟盼世界和平恢復之願望、故已與各中立國政府開始非正式性質之外交談話、此項談話並不涉及任何方案、而其性質僅為關於（一）穩健的國際經濟制度、（二）全世界縮减軍備兩事之初步詢問而巳、此種談話亦可推及交戰國、但僅以上述兩種與將來和平有關之共同問題為限、而不包括涉及目前戰爭狀况之事件、再此種談話與國務院幫辦　爾斯之游歐並無關聯云、聞赫爾巳召見各國駐美大使與公使而開始此種談話、赫爾昨晨接見荷蘭公使、據國務院某代表言、談話非以促成歐洲和平為旨趣、但注重戰後世界應有何種組織耳、消息靈通方面咸以為如認與中立國和平談話之說為結束目前歐戰之努力、則未免錯誤、蓋美政府此舉之目的顯然在對干各中立國尤其是弱小國家予以保證、他日討論和平時決不忽視其利益、美國將竭力務得眞正耐久之和平、俾可縮减軍備而恢復國際商業而已、關於此點各要人在新近公開演詞中、皆曾謂他日戰爭結束時、美國與他國皆將因商業上與金融上必要調整而遇有極重大難題、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>紐約　據華盛頓宣稱、美政府已決議竭其所能、不復以關於中立問題之尖銳牒文送交英國、凡英美政府間所有之問題、今後可山華盛頓美國官員與英大使洛齊安或山英國官員與美國駐英大使甘納第作私人會談而解決之、據若干官員之意見、巳往兩月來、美國連續送交英國措詞强硬之牒文、巳激起英國之興情、而達於驚人程度、實則兩國爭論殊屬無益、徒予希特勒以直接鼓勵而巳、美國此種新政策當然視此後不復發生英國侵犯美國中立權利之嚴重事件為轉移、（六日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　赫爾國務卿於發表公報後、即邀請各關係使卽、分期前科國務院會談、今晨首先接見荷蘭國公使羅斯登。據國務院發言人談稱、此項談話不以恢復歐洲和平為目標、而實與戰後世界組織問題有關、但各交戰國倘能一併參加談話、和平實亦不無實現之可能、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>愛情在快樂的春節裏</p>
<p>……應該是蓬勃地生長起來！</p>
<p>愛恍和時令與環境是有着密切的關係。因為我們的心是最靈活的，它和外界隨時有一種感應的作用。若在荒凉而寂寞的沙漠裏，任何茂盛的愛苗，恐怕也要受着摧殘而枯萎吧！那末，在這萬家燈紅酒錄，皆大歡喜的春節裏，年輕男女們心中的愛苗，一定會蓬勃地生長起來，而開滿了燦爛之花！</p>
<p>朋友！講到這裏，願你莫以為愛情是奢侈品！它雖生長在比較優裕的環境裏，但却為健全人生中所必有的東西，此猶一顆苗木必須要經過開花結果的時期是一樣的理由，要是它不能開花或不能結果，這就是它的缺陷。缺陷會造成人生的痛苦，遺下永不能彌補的恨憾！</p>
<p>今有事實證明，在此快樂的春節裏，如果是男健女美的伉儷或情人，他們對對雙雙，你愛我貪，一定是度着繾綣而甜蜜的生活，生男育女，家庭美滿，人生是多麼的幸福！可是男子若於早年犯有手淫，早婚縱慾，或病後失調，憂勞新傷，虧損了生殖腺內分泌液者，則凡腎虧陽痿，發育不全，精力渙散，腎虧不育，神經衰弱等症象即不一而足，此種病夫，雖逢新春佳節，有嬌妻擁抱，彼亦必不感興趣，至於在夫婦愛情基礎的性生活上，恒如曇花一現，或竟完全無能為力，這怎能不使妻子憎恨，而陷愛情於毀滅呢？沒有愛情的夫婦，就等於與寃家相處，人生痛苦莫有甚於此者！</p>
<p>欲除痛苦而享幸福，端在治愈其疾病而增進其健康。欲達此目的。據世界名醫及余等經騐均以服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為對症特效。因此劑質料名貴，監製精良，功效確實，補力偉大，實為一切類似製劑所不及。所以銷行最廣，歷史最久，為中西名醫一致所贊許。患者於服用此劑後，一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，助長發育，連服一月，必能治愈各症，使精力倍增，中老年人常服則延年益壽，返老還童，惟患遺精者須兼服特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」（中西五洲華英太和等大藥房及永安公司西藥部均售每匣實價兩元）以固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤速。</p>
<h3>遺精可使青年昏愚</h3>
<p>— （性病科醫師念曾）</p>
<p>有許多父母，很驚奇地說：我們的孩子為什麼越大越愚笨了？其實，根據心理學的論斷，孩子斷沒有越大越笨之理。智力的發展，大概可分五個時期，一至五歲為嬰兒期，六至十二歲為孩童期，十三至十八歲為靑年期，十九至二十五歲為成年期，二十六至四十歲為壯年期，其中各期智力發展最快者為靑年期，發展至最高點者為成年期，壯年期的智力或稍减退，但所减甚微。以後至中年老年期那就要逐漸减退了。依此而論。　要兒至孩童至靑年至成年，智力只有繼長增高，尤以靑年期，此時適當春情發動期，體內的生殖腺內分泌液極為活潑，囚此刺激着發育機能，體格突然高長，容光煥發，聲音增大，毛鬚漸生，情性轉變為勇敢慷慨，見健美女性，乃有求愛之慾，此時的智力亦大增，在孩童期認為難解之問題，斯時均得迎刃而解，思想豐富，記憶長强。…有上述的種種證據，我們巳確知生殖腺內分泌液（即精液）與智力有莫大關係。可是青年不知自愛，犯有手淫，或早婚縱慾，或憂勞斵傷，摧殘了性神經，使精關鬆弛者，必繼起遺精症。若患遺精而因循失治。則腦，脊髓，性各部神經因缺乏滋養呈枯萎狀態，發育作用停滯，新陳代謝减退，於是腦力衰弱，健忘失眠，思想昏慵，過去雖聰明者，現在即成為昏憒愚蠢了。同時必面黃肌瘦，體貌不揚，或竟腰痠背痛，腎萎早洩，發育不全等症相繼叢生，此種靑年不特求學難成，習業無望，且為女性所棄，妻妾所恨，陷入人世間最悲慘之境地！</p>
<p>遺精並不是不治之症。只須服以特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」當夜即可鞏固精關，鎭靜神經收安眠止遺，套神健腦之功。如遺精已久有上述症象者須兼服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎精血及神經，必可根治各症。惟患者能親來本診所兼施電療注射等新療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<h3>從恭賀春釐說到　女性們發乳發福</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>在快樂的春節里，彼此見面，必然要說一句：「恭賀新禧」，或是「新春納福」。今天作者和諸位第一次見面，不但要向諸位深深地說一句「恭賀新禧」，「新春納福」。並得要向女界同胞們，來一句旣眞摯又誠懇的「發乳發福」！</p>
<p>「發乳發福」的意義何在？諸位或許有些懷疑，但請一閉目凝思，便知作者的所謂一發乳發福」，就是要女界同胞們從今天起，個個獲得眞眞的幸福，而所謂眞眞的幸福，那必須先從發育乳峯做起。因為時代是前進的，健康是一切幸福之源，在審美觀念大異於昔的今日，苟乳峯為束胸，自凟，白帶，不應，月經不調，營養不良，多產虧弱等症所摧殘，形成鬆她萎癟，或平坦一如男子者。則不但健美喪失，曲線毫無交際塲中，無從左顧右盼，博得男子們輕憐蜜愛，即在佳節當前的春節里，亦祇有滿懷愁緖，觸景生感，嘆我生之不辰！尙有何幸福可言。欲謀補救，深望乘時奮起，在大地春回之初，積極服以生殖腺卵巢內分泌製劑女用「生殖素」，則一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，倘繼續服用，持之以恒，不惟萎癟的乳峯，能使之隆然高聳，堅實而有彈性，即瘦削的臀部，亦能變成丯腴，此外並能烏髮美顏，却病强身，功效之大，補力之宏，為任何司保命及臟器製劑所不及，歷經中西醫師負責證明，故得風行十年，而歷久益盛也。</p>

<p>救世軍自實行冬季施飯工作以來、歷經兩週、每日上午十時與下午六時巡週施給、其過去情形會經詳載報端、亦頗為各界人士所贊許、惟工作以來、一般乞丐等均尙能遵守秩序、並由該軍軍官選出精幹乞徒指揮排隊、挨次領取、故每日施飯之數量、現增至萬餘包以上、舊歷大除夕、該軍感彼輩貧困之徒、有終年求乞而未得肉味者、際茲中國舊俗、特捐得大批鹹肉、並定製饅頭數萬隻、分裝萬餘包、於下午六時半、裝運汽車三輛、自惇信路出發、經愛多亞路。法大馬路。大通路。厦門路。蘇州河北。以及外難一帶、施給貧困乞丐、計出發工作者有馬瑞山中佐、杜保田中校、曁全體軍官等百餘入、聞斯項施飯工作、仍繼續進行兩個月、而給肉施賑饅頭則已停止、以後視情形再行舉行、</p>

<h3>一九三九年度　上海工人生活狀况</h3>
<p>各種工人之工資率及實際收入　戰事發生後，男女時件各種工人之工資率及實際收入均低，而以男工為甚，本年則各業各種工人工資均增，然男工工資率及實際收入，尙較戰前一九三六年度為證。茲將本年各種工人之工資率及實際收入，與上年及一九三六年相比較其增减之勢，略如下表：</p>
<p>工作時間　本年各業每日平均工作時數，以繅絲業為最長，其决為棉紡，麵粉，棉織等業。以上各業。本年工作大致甚忙，往往延長工作時間，增加產額。烟草廠因營業稍遜，故每日工作，平均不過七小時。各業合計，其平均為一〇·九二小時，較上年微低。惟本年每月工作日數，則較上年略增，平均每月工作二三·七八日，一九三八年為二二·四八日，一九三六年為二三·六六日。就一般情形而論，本年各業皆忙，造紙業每月工作日數最多，平均為二八·五九日，决榨油業，為二七·八一日，又次麵粉業，為二七·二二日。火柴業工作，時有間輟，天氣變動，原料供給，俱有影響。本年下期，秋繭無法運滬，繅絲業最受影響，大多不得不出於停工一途，工作日數遂减也。</p>

<h3>商會春假四天　昨已實際工作　棉布廠領證明單　尙積存約四千件</h3>
<p>各業運貨往內地、均係領具證明淸單、方能騐放、此項淸單、允以棉布為大宗廢曆年關時、因即須變更領證辦法、故各染織廠之趕領淸單者、紛至沓來、每日不暇塡給、其中尤以大新振。綸華。華豐。三廠、佔數尤多、計該會日夜工作、星期亦不停止、直至廢曆除夕、尙積存近四千件之多、因此自二月八日起、至十一日止、雖有春假四天、但實際上內部工作、自十日起即已開始、限於淸理趕辦存件、惟對外概不接受文件、</p>

<h3>本市生活費指數　上月又現新高峯　貨幣購買力大見减低　法幣一元僅值三角强</h3>
<p>本年年度開始，生活費指數，又現新高峯。一月份總指數為三二五·四四，較二十五年度基期平均指數高達百分之二二五·四四，較上年一月高百分之一一四·五七，以較歷來最高之上年十二月份指數，亦高出百分之七·〇三。貨幣購買力因之减低，去年十二月，法幣一元，的當民國二十五年度之三角二分八厘九毫，本月則僅當三角〇七厘三毫。分類指數，均較上月提高，摘錄如下：</p>
<p>本月月杪，適近廢　歲末，每當斯時，市民置備年貨，物價必高，加以月終一週內，氣候轉寒，雨雪載途，影響亦劇。此外投機操縱，尤為提高一般物價之重要原因。</p>
<p>本月二號粳米，平均售價，較上月微低，然食米前途，正未許樂觀。月杪米市操縱之風甚熾，企圖私自越限，中次之貨，開售頭號四十元之限價，高貨率為操縱者囤積居奇，零售米店，輒以次貨摻雜應市。</p>
<p>本月麵粉售價在漲，月初每包價格，尙不及九元，迨入下旬，竟達十一元有餘。近來米價日貴，市民往往兼食麵食，雖云南人食米，然粉市狂漲，對於民食，影響亦復匪淺也</p>

<p>因戰事而停頓兩載之滬港埠際足球賽、經多番努力、本年卒吿恢復、滬港兩隊於舊曆元旦下午會師逸園、港隊因陣綫之軟弱、固在意料之中、以零比二受挫、上海隊上下半時各中一球、保持些『香港電報盃』、是日適値大年初一、故逸園票價雖最高座位售至二元二角、亦爭先恐後、擠得水洩不通、盛况不减於慈善賽、約計當上一萬五千人以上也、是日兩隊陣綫如左、</p>

<p>港隊平庸　守勝於攻　港隊因華人選手之拒絕參加北上、而西人隊員之第一流選手亦有因公而不能來者、故實力上相當軟弱、離港前、在港以三對零敗於港華聯、故此番滬隊之得勝早在意中、港隊自身亦明乎此、故是日臨時改變陣綫、以大吿山奴改仟中堅、全力看住勞巴斯托夫、全部採取寓攻於守的戰略、大史杜蘭治為埠際老將、與印人夏仙、兩後衛確屬不凡、中衛甘氏亦甚佳美、故滬隊雖在完全攻勢之下、屢射不入、僅獲二球者、即在於此、但港隊前鋒則平庸之極、旣無、中心之靈魂作領導、而右翼麥衣雲實一丙組球員耳、全綫如一盤散沙、最能活動者、僅一左翼小史杜蘭治耳、滬隊表演亦大為减色、兩後衛與三中衛最佳、尤以柯來脫與西格倫為最滿意、威利華特不及試賽時之穩、傑姆華特則竟於上半時踢十二碼而不中、前鋒五人、完全較平日為差、福恩麥克拉德之佳妙聯絡亦未獲見、曹秋亭則得球機會甚少、無從顯其顏色也、</p>
<p>勞巴斯托夫開紀錄　上海隊開球，大軍即向港隊門前壓迫、西格倫在門前二十碼處踢任意球、福恩截傳中央、孫錦順遲到一步、港隊反攻、大告山奴衝抵門前力射、海列遜一掃而出、轉瞬港隊門前又傳警報、老史杜蘭治左右照呼、忙於接應、滬隊猛攻之下、終於破門而入、第八分鐘時、柯萊脫得球遠送、福恩力盤進襲、向中飛傳、勞巴斯托夫、穿入老史杜　治與大告由奴中間、猛掃進門、滬隊一比零佔先、港隊傾全力反攻、曾獲二次角球機會、但毫無成效、荷息亦來一記挺硬脚頭、落入威利華特之手、孫錦順頭攻中木曹秋亭射門被撲住、皆些二十分鐘內之風波、直至第三十五分鐘、港隊甘氏手觸球被罰十二碼、空氣為之一緊、滬隊長傑姆華特主罰、竟踢中莫士威、致被撲至門後、此後滬隊雖有攻射、一無成就、上半時滬隊一比零佔先、</p>
<p>福恩再中　成二對零　休息重賽、港隊似稍見振作、但機會雖多、未有成功、徒見橫衝直撞耳、值荷息有一二次射門機會、滬隊進攻、亦被港後方五衛、密密佈防、不得其門而入、勞巴斯托夫厄於大吿山奴、頗難發展、如此者凡三十七分鐘、春雲又見開展、李義臣中央得球、截傳麥克拉德、麥着地輕輕向福恩送去、福恩趕上一脚、恰中門柱一彈進網、滬隊增加一球、成一比零之局、其後兩隊均有攻守、亦不過數衍殘局而已、結果上海隊以二比零保持『香港電報盃』、</p>

<p>港變陣容　港隊陣綫、七分鐘之後、因守門莫士咸之面部受傷、即大加變動、陣容更改如下、守門莫士咸、後衛夏仙花路、中綫加士地路甘氏韓尼波路、前鋒李安納大吿山奴福克司荷息小史杜蘭治、華聯開球、迎陽作戰、地理上似乎不利、而李義臣又因前一日作戰過劇受傷、右翼張銘生一般上甚露軟弱、故許文奎處於孤立、只見其東奔西突、右翼完全陷入不利、港隊則一反其前一日之守為攻、故開賽之後、港隊殊為猖獗、華聯立起迎戰、秋亭沿邊進取、飛向中傳、許文奎迎門一脚、竟吿高飛失的、華聯進攻不已、阿奎傳孫錦順、甘氏救出、秋亭接得冉進、冲抵鬥前、莫士咸趕出撲救、不料秋亭迎面一脚、莫氏遂受傷不起、經扶起敷傷、停頓凡三分鐘之久、方繼續比賽、港隊陣容於是大加變換、</p>
<p>進而不計　戰端再啟、雙方動作、漸見粗魯、雖經裁判沈回春一再處罰、仍繼續發見、亦使是賽精彩、影響不少、雙方互有攻守、形成勢均力敵之概、港隊前鋒、不若前一日之愁眉不展、李安納大告山奴、活躍非凡、華聯張銘生之一再失着、亦殊可惜、接戰至四十分鐘、此難解難分之局勢、方有新局面發展、錦順傳秋亭、再達黃克厚、莫士咸救出後、小史杜蘭治得球挺進、張林根趕救不及、球已飛傳右角、大吿山奴跳起一頂、球入網去、港隊方握手稱慶、不料裁判沈回春判作無效、蓋大吿山奴頂中之前、已吿犯規也、一塲空歡喜、上半時各無所得、</p>
<p>十二碼球　唐喬司奏樂休息後、兩軍再行會戰、港隊之進攻、更見劇烈、小史杜蘭治單騎進擾、大吿山奴李安納左右夾擊、陸鍾恩頓時左右接應、急不擇暇、麗都則球運欠通、殊感格格不入之苦、張銘生許文奎聯袂而下、阻於花路、秋亭傳中、鐵腿又失、黃克厚加上一脚、但見飛人門後、而港隊之攻勢、依然未戢、孟義良力阻福克司、不料一推而犯規、被判罰十二碼、大告山奴輕蹴而入、華聯遂先吿陷落一城、</p>
<p>絕處逢生　雙方攻守互有、局勢之沉悶、一至於極、李義臣傷不能奔、代為着急、幸而港隊雖攻、不得其門而入、華聯之慘敗似為巳定之局、孫錦順許文奎黃克厚雖拚命反攻、亦無回天之術、萬餘球迷、正在垂頭喪氣、不料絕處逢生、最後二分鐘、曹秋亭沿邊直下、一脚挑中、恰落門前、黃克厚飛身趕上、球飛入右角、巳敗之局卒挽成和局、中錢開球、不數盤旋、終塲笛聲巳起矣、</p>

<h3>休刊期內之　外匯市場　謠風籠罩　市勢步驟</h3>

<p>六日（週二）、外滙巿况、中央與滙豐掛牌俱無上落、英美滙暗巿續吿緊軟、一度再創見本年來之最緊價、初　即受港地投機商委華行扒進、致不久即吿軟至四辦士三七五及七元二五、嗣以沙遜力售近期、且外行運通及少數投機商亦有賣出、故斯時曾回硬至四辦士四二一八七五及七元三四三七五、後因電傳偽方有籌備「新中央」銀行並發行紙幣之說、是以投機商紛起活動、再加沙遜午後亦來復進遠期、故一度又緊至四辦士三五九三七五及七元二一八七五、後以華比及美銀行乘貴尙肯供塞、故迄午收、遂稍回硬、仍為四辦士三九〇六二五及七元二八一二五、結果比上日續緊〇一五六二五及〇三一二五、</p>

<h3>中國空軍的生長</h3>
<p>— 蕙滋</p>
<p>壯健的飛將軍　是衛國的干城</p>
<p>二年半以前常日本開始侵略中國時，中國僅有一所航空學校，那就是杭州筧橋的航空軍官學校，但現在却在各處設立分校，訓練飛行學生。訓練時計分初步，中間，完成三種步驟，轟炸機飛行術和驅逐機飛行術也在各處分別訓練，這些都是隊伍以外的空軍的根本訓練。</p>
<p>飛行的學習　在四川的某幾個角落裏當　的居民從清夢中醒來常常聽得翱翔於空中的飛機的軋軋聲，那些駕駛員都是高大的個子，壯健而蓬勃，年齡大的在十八至二十二之間，最初的幾小時他們是需要教師伴同飛行，但大的經過十小時的伴同訓練飛行後，他們就能獨立飛翔於空中了，除了飛行術以外他們還要學攀援登高，躲避襲擊等其他作戰有用的技術。</p>
<p>經過六個月訓練後，一個聰明些的學生他的初步訓練吿終，再六個月以後次步訓練又吿終，於是在第一步完成訓練中分成轟炸驅逐二種，總之，至少要費十八個月去完成一個航空人員。</p>
<p>由於體力和智力方面的標準很高，那些被錄取的人數僅佔投考人數的百分之二或三（因體力失敗者大部由於目力不合格）而在錄取的人中一百人中只有六十人會畢業，其餘則都在歷次的試驗中被淘汰了。</p>

<p>那些不蒙錄取或後經淘汰的常常會痛哭而後離去，因為他們報國的機會失去了，至於那些錄取的靑年都是很好的飛行員，遇到艱難時很能沉着應付，因為在他們的胸中燃燒着愛國的火焰，當第一期訓練吿終將進入完成訓練時在轟炸和驅逐一種飛行之間，他們常常選擇驅逐飛行，雖經教師解釋轟炸在空戰中更為有用，但他們仍願學驅逐飛行，因為他們願意和　以轟炸中國平民的外來飛機決一雌雄，至於對於機身他們都很愛護，因此飛機的損壞率是很小很小的</p>
<p>學習的費用　至於飛行課程的所耗是非常驚人的，佔　中國政府所費於一個飛行學生的，在他初步訓練中約五〇〇〇至六〇〇〇元，第　步訓練中約一五〇〇〇至二五〇〇〇元，在第三步完成訓練中則要到三五〇〇〇—四五〇〇〇元之鉅了，所以每一個畢業的飛行生，除了他無代價的生命之外，還要費這麼鉅大的款項去完成他。</p>
<p>站着他們的生活不論在教室中或飛行塲十紀律是非常　密的，但决不至枯燥，因為他們常哼出一些進行或其他的曲子，飯食方圓是非常充足而優美，但他們總是站着吃飯的，因為他們曾聯合發了一個誓，就是在侵略者沒逐出黃海之前，他們的飯廳中不要有椅凳。</p>
<h3>第十四世達賴喇嘛卽位</h3>
<p>— 菊</p>
<p>據本月六日重慶電訊，謂第十四世達賴喇嘛，業已即位，（見七日本埠西報國民政府匯去四十萬元，作為舉行典禮時的費用。</p>
<p>依照西藏人的傳說，達賴喇嘛是不死的，所謂死是肉體的轉換，所以在一九三三年十二月十七日第十三世達賴喇嘛逝世時所產生的小孩，必有一人由他轉世，於是尋覓多日，直至一九三七年十月在靑海的江土崖尋得，這小孩現年六歲，名叫拉木登珠就是新近即位的達賴喇嘛第十四世。當他初見去尋他的呼圖克圖時，伸出小手來要念佛珠，原來十三世生前曾有一副念佛珠贈給呼圖克圖的，這是轉世的一個有力證據。他是一位富農的第三個兒子，兄弟共四人，家庭生活漢族化，所以這小孩子能說漢語，但並不多。身體壯健，目光炯炯。靑海的馬步芳將軍，以達賴轉世在他的轄地，便派人保護，主張在靑海養育，不久　薩又宣布在其附近覓得一位轉世者時，馬將軍方答應將他送往拉薩喇嘛寺，這才於去年七月十三日起程往西藏，旅費亦山國民政府開支，計十萬元。在路上八星期。</p>
<p>第十四世達賴的候選者既有三位，依照向例，應當用抽籤法來決定。抽籤儀式頗莊重，除衆喇嘛喃喃唸咒，焚香祝禱外，另用紙片，以藏文及華文書寫候選人的名氏，卷成與香烟差不多的樣子，放入金瓶中，由國府派去的代表（現為吳忠信氏）用筷箝出一個來，其人即為當選者。這次却沒有此項手續，因為在靑海誕生這一位達賴已證實為十三世轉世無號，所以同第八世達賴喇嘛能說出前世的故事一樣，不必再抽籤了。</p>
<p>關於抽籤時藏票的金瓶，此地順便說一說，該物為一七九二年時乾隆皇布設置的。這以前，達賴喇嘛的承繼者，常發生爭執。自從裝設金瓶後，就用拈闖為定。金瓶共二隻，一置拉薩，一置北平喇嘛廟，預備如遇拉薩有變亂時，這儀式就得在北平舉行。其間除八世及現在的十四世達賴喇嘛外，都用這法選出的。</p>

<h3>兩廣徭族考</h3>
<p>— 徐松石</p>
<p>徭本作猺。猺字的使用起於唐朝，含有輕視的意思。現在各族共和，應該改為径字。</p>
<p>徭的種族分佈　目前兩廣徭人在廣東則以北江湟水流域，和欽州　山等地為多。在廣西則以柳江流域為衆。廣西修仁。象縣。武宣。桂平。平南。蒙山。數縣交界的大徭山，尤為搖人叢聚的淵藪。現寺全廣東尚未齊民什的徭人的五萬餘。全廣西尚未齊民化的徭人約二十餘萬。單單上列大径山一處的人口，已在四萬以上了。</p>
<p>徭有侯徭，金秀徭，紅徭，坳徭，狗頭徭，蠻徭，藍靛徭，光頭徭，馬頭徭，白褲徭，三花徭，榜徭，尖頭徭，董籠徭，盤徭，良徭，板徭，過山徭，畬径，白衣山子，等二十餘種。在廣東的幾乎全是板徭盤搖畲搖。在廣西的亦以板徭盤徭為多。</p>
<p>作者生長嶺南，旅行考察西粵径山　次。據我所知道的，廣西徭人的先世大部分來自廣東。他們往往自稱來自廣東的珠璣巷。按珠璣巷本在南雄。嶺南的富家大族，多半以系出珠璣為口頭禪。徭人之說是否可靠，不敢斷定。</p>
<p>兩粵徭民來源　至於廣東徭人的來源，則世人論斷不一。或謂徭人原是廣東最初土著。被逼而漸漸流入廣西，遂使今日廣西的徭人多於廣東。或謂廣東徭人的來源已不可考，但非廣東最初土著。作者按淸初郝氏廣東通志，尚列淸遠縣徭山一〇六處，從化縣徭山三十五處，曲江縣徭山四處，英德縣徭山二處，高州徭山九處，四會縣徭山五十八處，新興縣徭山五十四處，陽春縣徭山九十四處，陽江縣徭山一十三處，恩平縣徭山七處，德慶州徭山四十九處，封川縣徭山二處，開建縣径山三十三處，茂名縣徭山四十四處，電白縣徭山二十一處，信宜縣徭山八十三處，化州徭山五十一處，靈山縣徭山二十六處，東安縣（即今雲浮）径山二十二處，西寗縣（即今鬱南）徭山二十八處，連山縣徭山五處。同時皇淸職貢圖也謂新寗樂昌增城乳源合浦等縣均有径人。淸朝初年廣東的徭人還這樣繁衆，怪不得有許多人說徭人乃是廣東最初的土著。</p>
<p>但照作者的考證，其實不是這樣。按嶺南徭亂最初見於宋仁宗時。宋史仁宗紀，謂仁宗景祐二年，徭僚寇雷化州。又宋史楊畋傳，謂仁宗慶歷三年，湖南徭人刦掠州縣。賊聞畋至，踰嶺南遁。自此以後，廣東徭亂方才日甚一日。可見徭人在廣東的歷史仍然比較的淺。况且根據作對十餘年的研究，巳經斷定兩廣最初的土著不是径人而是徸人了。</p>
<p>古代徭人居地　作新敢謂除了潮循，帶的畬徭外，兩廣其他各處的径人都全山江西湖南而來。而最遠古徭人的居地，還是浙江福建二省。我們可以說浙閩二省，原是徭族同胞的故鄉。法朝的山越，便是徭族。徭人喜用盤古二字為地名，迄今盤古二字的地名，自江蘇經江西湖南而至兩廣，連綿不絕。宋羅長源謂淮安有盤古廟，廣，即楊州有盤古塚和盤古祠，江西會昌有盤古由，　都有盤古祠，湖南湘鄉有盤古保。作者按其他如湖南的衡陽常寗，和江西的尋鄔等地，都有盤古的地名。兩粵盤古地名之多，更難枚舉。兩廣盤古地名都是徭人所立，而且唯獨徭人敬拜盤古。徭人先世來自華東，昭昭可考，這豈不是一件很有趣的事麽？作者近著的粵江流域人民史（中華書局出版）還有兩粵徭族同胞很詳細的考證。這裏只是一鱗半爪罷了。</p>

<h3>拾荒的人們</h3>
<p>— 靈雨</p>
<p>在垃圾裏發掘寶藏　每天所得僅一二毛</p>
<p>把隔夜的垃圾出淸，於是一畚箕一畚箕的傾倒在垃圾箱裏，拾荒的人們——在淸早便開始在活躍了。</p>
<p>他們所要的是什麽東西呢？破碎的玻璃片，和洋瓶，污穢不堪的破碎紙張，不到五分長的香烟屁股，沒有了蓋的破瓦罐頭。面與底將要脫離關係的鞋子，煤球的渣滓，包查烟的錫紙，已經歷癟了的香烟罐頭，一小塊一長條的破布或舊棉花，以及破的一切……他們什麽都要。</p>
<p>有些地方有專鬥收買這些東西的純粹舊垃圾店，據說，一罐頭的香烟屁股，可以買二分錢，包香烟的錫紙，十張可以買一分錢，破紙每斤是二分錢，破布每斤是三分錢，破銅爛鐵，那就比較得貴一些，不過很少見，破鞋子每隻一分，因為在那裏正可以配對。舊洋釘之類可以買到八分錢一斤，靠拾荒過活的人們，這一種店舖便是他們的出路。</p>
<p>有時，他們也有例外的收穫，破皮夾裏戊出一張二毛錢的角票，垃圾箱畔拾得一隻眼挖耳，香烟罐裏發見一隻香烟嘴，以及一切的成為物品的東西，這種東西的售價，當然要比破爛的東西高上幾倍。這一種都是例外的收護，不過是一種偶然的幸運罷了。</p>
<p>拾荒的人們，大半是衣衫襤褸，形容憔悴，枯貨的臉色夾着烟容，雖則可以得到一兩毛一天，可是，這一批人的生活簡直同乞丐是一樣的呢？</p>

<h3>求學愼始</h3>
<p>— 楊春樣</p>
<p>寒假一轉眼就溜去，一個新的學期已經開始了。小朋友們過了兩星期的家庭生活，現在又背着書包，跳跳蹦蹦地上學去了。</p>
<p>在寒假裏，你們做了些甚麼工作？我想也許多半被你們輕易地虛擲了的。那時候，你們是這樣想着：天氣這麼寒冷，等到開學以後再努力吧！</p>
<p>現在開學的時候是到了。你們是否如假期中所想的那樣努力呢？現在的思想，你們也許又改變了吧？以為來日方長，今天過了，還有明天，努力不必在初開學的時候，再過幾天靜靜心再說。要知道，光陰的消逝，是最迅速的。今天雖是開學的日子，但是也只要一剎眼，暑假是又會很快地到來的！多少有為的兒童們，都被「來日方長」道句成語躭誤了他們的前程。親愛的小朋友們！趁現在學期才開始的當兒，趕快打定你們的工作計劃！從今天起，就開始你們的努力吧！</p>
<p>『起首用點力，結果一定好。』小朋友們現在正同新春時候的一切草木的萌芽一般，如果希望將來有良好的結果，全靠在春日溫和的氣候裏，好好地培養起來，沒有病蟲害的摧殘，才會欣欣地向榮。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友們！現在是一學期的開始，也是你們努力的發軔。這麽一個重要的好機會，你們無論如何不可失去，好好地去幹吧！我想你們到下學期結束的時候，一定能得到更好的收穫！</p>
<h3>怎樣研究科學？</h3>
<p>— 叔善</p>
<p>小朋友們要知道：：一個人的一生根本都是在學」。你們以為對不對？諺語上所謂學到老，學不了」。「學無止境」……種種的話，是一個很明確的證實，而且都是在警戒我們，因此「學」對於我們有密切的關係。可是今天要和小朋友們討論的是關於科學方面，因為現代是科學化的時代，一切都需科學化，那麼科學和我們便有更重要的聯繫，因此我們對於科學要有一番確切的研究，否則就要捲入淘汰的漩渦。我國又是一個科學落後的國家，那麽科學的需要更是迫切了。然而怎樣去研究科學呢？筆者不是個科學家，當然沒有什麽有系統而詳密的方法，也談不到什麼經驗，不過，這下列的幾點提出來和各位小朋友們商討，也可說這幾點是研究科學的必需條件。</p>
<p>（一）仔細的觀察：科學大部分是着重觀察，因為現代研究科學的方法，大都採用歸納法，就是觀察各方面事實的演變，來測定其最後一定的結論，然而我們容易患一種毛病，就是自以為聰明，而先去猜測它的結果，便疏忽了仔細的觀察。</p>
<p>（二）忍耐的態度：這是研究科學的必須條件，但是我們時常貪簡怕繁，每個人都有逼心理，就是頂好拿到一問題目，一看之下希望立即得到它的結果，然而事實上恰恰不能符合你的理想：那你便丟，不去再思考了，這就缺乏了忍耐的態度，怎樣能得到正確的結果呢？</p>
<p>（三）客觀的批評：教師教給你的學識，一方面當誠意的接受下來，但一面應當批評這個學識的一端是對的，那一端為什麽不對？為什麼這一端是不錯的？能不能適合其他一切的現象？有什麼不完備的缺點？一一的由自己來決定，這樣便可澈底的了解不是盲從的了。</p>
<p>（四）盡量的參考，書本上的學識舉竟是有限的，就是你能十二分的明瞭，也寥寥無幾，更應盡量的參考其他的書籍，再請教比你學識豐富的師長或父兄……作進一步的認識，深一層的了解！</p>
<p>這淺淺的四點，貢離給剛開學了沒有多天的小朋友們，如能完全達到這標準，那你的學識日增無窮，前程遠大了，</p>
<h3>讀書小計劃</h3>
<p>— 童友</p>
<p>一，無論你造怎樣忙，每天至少有兩個時間讀書，就是早上早起一刻鐘，晚上遲睡刻鐘。</p>
<p>二，每天至少讀書半小時，至少讀五頁，在一年中就可以讀二千頁左右了。</p>
<p>三，在讀書的時候，必須專心，冬天不怕冷，夏天不怕熱，不想煩惱和快樂的事。</p>
<p>四，讀畢後，一定要思索一下，將書內的要點牢記。</p>
<h3>海陸兩用的炸彈</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>我們只知道，炸彈祇能轟炸陸地上的東西，海洋裏破壞的工作要讓魚雷去佔功了。但是聰明的科學家，它早已想也靠飛機上擲下來的炸彈去破壞敵人在水面上逞雄的戰艦，到現在，果然成功了。</p>
<p>這一個發明，我按捺不住要介紹給小朋友們，因為報紙上刊載的消息太使人興奮了，德國魚雷的工作竟使在海上稱覇的英國海軍遭受大難，巡洋艦，戰鬭艦犧牲了不少，我想小朋友看了這些新聞，一定　不住要稱讃魚雷的偉大了吧？是彈是偉大的。」</p>
<p>這一種海陸兩用的炸彈，能在空間為炸彈，入水成魚雷，一個大炸彈，包藏四個圓筒，如果丟落在水中，儲藏炸藥的四個圓筒立刻散開，由原來裝在裏面的壓縮空氣推動它們分四個方向進行，如同魚雷一般的快，它們撞着了敵船，立即爆發，最厲害的，假使這大炸彈投擲在水裏，並沒有碰到敵船的時候，它竟會分成四個魚雷向每一方向猛進，範圍很大，擊中目標也比較容易，因此敵、遭受的襲　危險也愈大。這一椿驚大的發明，一旦美國和世界上任何國家發生戰爭時，就能看到它的能力了。</p>
<h3>廢曆新年中的兩種影像</h3>
<p>— 聞怡</p>
<p>「新年到了！」「新年到了！」各處傳出這樣的歡呼聲。街上比以前更熱鬧，燦爛的光輝，由四方射出，散在嘈雜的空氣中。滬和甜蜜的音樂，顯出是文明國的人民所發出的。來來往往的，差不多一半是小朋友，笑着，跳着，奔着，玩着，覺得別有樂趣，勝人別的仙境。大人們也由此時作樂，牌聲到處可以聽見，肉，雞，以及種種的香味，從屋角裏傳出來。鞭爆連續不斷的響着，一般人都忙碌賀年。但是被饑寒所迫，猛向黑暗環境進攻着的人們，正在低低哭泣，為了謀生，不得不在街上跑來跑去行乞，心中在想：明天能否得到一些食糧，護他們繼續維持一天嗎？他們哭喪的臉，仰視着天，懇求上天賜給他們一些食物。皮膚是凍得僵了，再也不能動了，木偶似的伏着，以上二種景象，地獄對天堂，可是只隔一堵薄粉牆！</p>
<h3>孵鴿記</h3>
<p>— 沈錫身</p>
<p>虬兒家中的晒臺上，養着一對鴿了，潔白的羽毛，多麽可愛！白天一起飛出去，傍晚又一同飛回來。虬兒於課餘之暇，替他們打掃房舍，加餵食料，眞也愛　備至！有一天，虬兒正在替他們掉換稻草的時候，忽然在裏面發現了兩個鴿蛋，很是玲瓏可愛。有人說：鴿蛋是，可以滋補的，但虬兒却不忍把這兩條未來的小生命糟塌了，所以便讓那母鴿去孵小鴿子。</p>
<p>在孵鴿　內，那母鴿便不飛出去了，早早晚晚，只是把鴿蛋緊湊在身下：鴿蛋受着了長時間的熱力，內部更斬斬變化起來，約摸兩個星期後，小鴿子是出來了。起初是沒有一根羽毛的，三四天後，便長出了些黃黃的羽毛，也發出了些微弱的叫聲，形狀很像小鴿。母鴿便開始哺食了；他把自己吃過的米榖，再從喉中吐出來，去喂給他的兩個孩子吃，一天總得三四次。其他更很留心的照護他們，假使你走近小鴿身旁，而適巧母鴿不在的話，他會立刻跑回來，護衛他們；或者你想把鴿捉起來，母鴿就要伸出他的嘴來啄你。他對兒女們如此的愛護備至，形影不離，眞使我們暸解到母性的偉大，人與鳥獸，原是一樣的！</p>
<p>小鴿子在他母親小心的謹育下，長成是很快的；一十天後，這兩隻雛兒的顏色，形狀，沒有一樣不像他的父母，不久便會飛了。</p>
<p>但是母鴿却巳消瘦了不少。</p>
<h3>黑兄弟　（五）</h3>
<p>— 一木</p>
<p>希華喃喃地說道：你要是敢再來得小心一些才是！」他雖是這樣說，心中却也有些害怕害怕，顫巍巍地從壁角裏走將出來；同時那老紳士也早巳走了出去，砰的一聲，把那門帶上了。一霎時間，只見一片雲霧，飛過窗外，一會兒打着旋子，變出種種的模樣兒來，向着山谷下面滾去，又在空氣中翻了好幾個轉身，便在一陣急雨中消滅了。</p>
<p>希華轉向格勒怒叱道：「哼哼，格勒先生，你幹得好事！快快把那羊肉盛在碟子裏，要是你再敢搗鬼給我拿住了的話—呀，這羊肉怎麽割過了！」格勒忙道：「哥哥，你曾經允許過分　片給我的。」希華大怒道：「好好，你趁着熱先割下來，可以多吃些肉汁，你眞是個鬼精靈！奇是我也不許你再這樣的放肆下去了。先生，快快離開這裏，到煤窖子裏等着，不聽得我的呼喚，不許出來。」</p>
<p>格勒不敢違拗，沒精打采的走了出去，他的兩位哥哥却把那羊肉大嚼了一頓，到得肚子裏裝不下了，便將剩餘的鎖在碗　裏；當下兩人又拿出酒來，喝得醉醺醺地。</p>
<p>這一夜雨急風狂，兀自無休無歇。希華和漢士倆在臨睡時，先把窗上的木板全都關緊，又將門上拴上兩根鐵鍵，然後到臥房裏去。他們倆原是陲在一間房裏的。到得時鐘打十二下時，兩人忽被一片很大的倒塌聲驚醒了。那房門不知被什麽强大的力量打開，直使整個的屋子都震動起來。</p>
<p>希華在牀上驚呼道：「這是什麽一回事？」却聽得那老紳士冷冷地答道：不過是我罷了。」兄弟倆即忙翻身起來坐在那個長枕頭上瞪大了眼睛，向黑暗中望去，却見臥房中已漫了水，一道模糊的月光，從窗板上的一個窟窿中射進來，成了一個挺大的水泡泡，不住的滾動，接着又像木塞子搬上下擺動了一會，才頓住了上面正靠坐着那老紳士，熊去很舒服似的，倒像靠坐在一個最溫軟最富麗的椅墊上一般，並且尖帽長袍，仍然穿戴得齊齊整整；那帽子的尖項，　得高高地的，因為屋頂已沒有了。</p>
<p>老紳士　着譏議的口氣說道：「對不起，有擾了。我瞧你們的牀舖怕巳被雨水打濕，還是到你們弟弟的房間裏去，因為那邊的天花板，我還給他保留着哩。」</p>
<p>兄弟倆也不敢說什麼話，疾忙趕到格勒的臥房裏去，身上早已濕透，心中充滿了恐怖。老紳士在背後喊道：「你們倆可在廚房的桌子上發見我的名片。請記着，這是我末一次的奉訪。」希華抖顫着說道：「求求天，最好是末一次吧！」當下那水泡泡就不見了。</p>
<p>天明了，兄弟倆從格勒的小窗子裏望出去時，只見百實谷已成了荒地，所有的樹木啊，禾稼啊，牛羊啊，都被洪水冲去，換上了一大堆紅色的沙，和灰褐色的泥土。兄弟倆一面打顫，一面爬到廚房中去，却見水已浸沒了地板，所有的錢鈔和動用的東西，早已一掃而空，只有一張小小的白紙片留在桌子上，上面刻着幾個　彎曲曲的長體大字道：「西南風先生。」</p>

<h3>春節新片介紹</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>泰山得子　看完了一泰山得子」，我想特別提出飾泰山之子的小演員，——約翰休費爾。他在山谷中穿躥，在水底游泳（不知是否、替身」），活潑天眞，比「仲夏夜之夢」時候的米蓋羅納更可愛。</p>
<p>故事是泰山在失事的飛機中拾得一個倖免於難的孩子，他與珍妮取名：“Boy”愛如已出。後來孩子的族叔來鄉村探詢下落，泰山因不肯「寳愛」離去，被珍妮騙到山谷中困着，將孩子送去，但是族叔冀圖霸佔遺產，殺死了同伴，强逼珍妮仝行。却不幸誤入土人麕居區域，被土人所俘。後卒賴「寳愛」逃出，泰山率領象隊前來救護出險。</p>
<p>這裏有泰山與孩子在水底戲嬉的特攝那個猴子的滑稽表演，大隊象羣的衝鋒，及各種熱帶禽獸的攝取，這該是春節中最有趣味的一部電影。</p>
<p>江山美人　是女王伊麗莎白執政的時候，她和愛塞士伯爵的一段羅曼斯。但在伯爵叛變之後，伊麗莎白終於把伯爵送上斷頭台。</p>
<p>在戲院中的兩小時，不但這故事感動了我，蓓蒂台維絲的伊麗莎白，她的精湛的演技，更予人極大的與奮。從她的一舉一動中，我們彷彿透過了她的心胸一樣，看到了她內心的苦悶與衝突（江山和愛情）；然而她又處處保持淸崛强的性格，和女王的尊貴。這成功，我以爲是遠在「卿何薄命」和「長想思」之上的。</p>
<p>導演者對於故事的剪裁可以當得簡潔兩個字，更可愛的是每一塲戲的情緖氣氛，都能强固地把握着：譬如伊麗莎白解除愛塞士伯爵的兵權，及伯爵赴斷頭台的兩塲戲，更是緊湊生動。</p>
<p>鐘樓怪人　我沒有看過鄔却乃的默片，但是重攝的聲片一定超過默片，我敢武斷的。全片在導演者雄闊的手腕支持下，他始終緊緊地執着這故事所賦予的緊張氣氛，像洪水一樣直瀉而下，幾乎沒有使人喘息的餘地。面對於鐘樓怪人桂西摩杜的變態心理，也有可愛的描寫。</p>
<p>却爾斯勞頓的化裝與演技，可謂盡善盡美。瑪琳奧哈蘭也較「黑每人妖」進步。其他如路易十一，福洛伯爵，詩人格林戈里等搭配整齊。値得稱許。</p>
<h3>劇壇動態</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>葛嫩娘」自大除夕晚上獻演以來，還是每塲客滿。這裏面有幾個演員都是從開塲演到終塲，非常吃力，上次公演時，都因之病倒；現在爲調劑演員精力起見，大概三四天後，「葛嫩娘」只演夜塲，日塲改演熊佛西原著的「孽海花」。導演是李萍倩。</p>
<p>上海劇藝社的「女兒國，是一部新型幻想劇，在中國舞臺上尙屬創見，營業也是鼎盛。因爲這次全體演員都上臺，下一個新戲不能排練，所以接一女兒國」的，他們預備重演「愛與死的搏鬥」。</p>
<p>在許多大劇團中，大鐘劇社是最有精神與最有成績的一個，上次在福煦路俄國小劇塲公演五個獨幕劇，內外行一致贊許。現在他們又請「七夕」的編導者許幸之導演夏衍原著的「花燭之夜」定在元宵節起公演四天，塲地依舊借俄國小劇塲。</p>
<h3>馬連良四十壽辰　故都伶界籌備慶祝</h3>
<p>— 執戈</p>
<p>名伶馬連良，將於本月十七日度其四十誕辰，而夫人本年亦逢三十初度，故在平友好，爲之發起雙壽紀念，北平伶界聞已籌備盛大堂會，冀在此鐵蹄下之陰沉局面，一洩苦悶之氣氛；上海方面，馬氏頗多故舊，均將發電致賀，共伸慶祝屆時當有一番特殊盛况也。馬有五子二女均爲前妻所出，長子名崇仁，次崇義，崇禮，崇智，崇信，女亦成年，均在中小學攻讀，除長子習武生外，餘則不入伶界，蓋亦做一行怨一行之意歟！</p>
<p>又悉，馬氏將於兩月後來滬，出演黃金，該院預定奚嘯伯之後爲程硯秋之秋聲社，接程氏後隊者，即馬氏所率之扶風社也。</p>

<p>木偶匹諾丘</p>
<p>許久許久以前的一倘晚上，黃昏星在漆黑的天空中閃爍着。它的銀白色的光芒照着下面一個小村莊，照着一個孤零零的行人，獨自一個兒在這靜悄悄的小市鎭裏忽走着。他是衣衫　褸的蟋蟀吉密耐，小小的肩上還默着一個包裹。這時，他很疲倦，需要休息，因此便自一間屋子的窗洞裏跳了進去。</p>
<p>裏面的爐火還求熄滅，他見一個和靄的老者在做着個木偶。這個老頭兒便是遠近村人都敬愛的老木匠吉白吐。他一個人住在這裏——只有小貓費茄羅和金魚克麗娥是他僅有的夥伴——專替人製造和修理玩具。他眞是此地村裏製造快樂的天使。這裏是他的工塲，也就趁他的家。木偶最後一部工作——油漆——完畢了，小貓金魚和吉白吐都很歡喜地笑着。老木匠給他起了一個名字：匹諾丘。Pinocchio匹諾丘，多美的一個名字！恰似他的模樣一般引人愛憐。你看他坐在那兒，多神氣。圓圓的臉，大大的眼睛，又長又尖的鼻子，頭上戴着一頂帽子，上面還揷着一根美麗的羽毛：伶俐可愛，活像個眞的男孩子——可是，可是却不會說話，不會動。「希望之星啊！」在臨睡時候，吉白吐向天上的黃昏星渴望地祈求着，「假使匹諾丘是一個眞的活的孩子，那多麼好呢！」</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Spring Festival This Year</h3>
<p>Regardless of who it is, assuming that they do not regard life and the functions of society as merely mechanical, then the national new year is just the national new year. But one should still not overbearingly disregard the Spring Festival, or too lightly scorn its meaning. Of course, deliberately resisting government orders and excessively advocating the Spring Festival is unnecessary and unacceptable.</p>
<p>During the Spring Festival, the entire society takes a break following custom; therefore, people in all professions are also on vacation; the society becomes a sleeping state, and the season becomes a time for special consumption. What is striking is the completely new Spring Festival couplets, chanting good wishes; young men and women in brightly colored clothes, walking in groups; game parks announce they are full, and thoroughfares also announce that they are crowded. The usual habit of complaining at every turn, even throwing punches, is replaced these days by casually spoken blessings and polite bows; the evil mother-in-law who is stern all year round may have a hint of a smile these days; the cold-hearted procuress may have some warmth these days; street beggars, of course, these days are likely to meet a temporary small philanthropist; those who toil like oxen and horses all year round can also get a little respite. In short, the Spring Festival has all these natural blessings; regardless of who it is, one should not disregard these blessings, as they have their own value. One must admit that the Spring Festival generally creates a temporary zest for life. What's more, yesterday it was confirmed that the Chinese army had officially recovered Xiaochu, adding even more splendor to the Spring Festival!</p>
<p>But one must also remember: in the midst of the War of Resistance, the generals and soldiers on the front lines, braving wind and snow, sweating and bleeding, are striving for the survival of the nation, for the final victory, they have no time to enjoy the natural blessings of the Spring Festival! The survival or destruction of the nation, the life or death of the race, and the success or failure of the war are not the sole responsibility of the generals and soldiers on the front lines; sweating and bleeding are not their sole obligations. The arrival of the final victory is bought with their blood and lives, but everything after the victory is not for them to enjoy alone! Remembering this, how should the average person spend this Spring Festival?</p>
<p>Now, the Chinese authorities are promoting a widespread "Spring Gift Military Appreciation Movement," intending to express the people in the rear's remembrance of the soldiers on the front lines and to comfort them; this is a duty, and it must not be regarded as a mere seasonal decoration. Chairman Chiang himself has set an example, sending a large sum of money through representatives to the Spring Gift Military Appreciation Association to commend the soldiers fighting in the War of Resistance; people everywhere have also followed suit and responded enthusiastically. Since the National Army moved west, Shanghai has become an isolated island, and the Chinese people on the isolated island naturally have many differences from those in the interior; but the bloodlines are the same, and their consciences are the same. The relationship between the prosperity or decline of the nation and the success or failure of the War of Resistance is exactly the same. Therefore, this "Spring Gift Military Appreciation Movement" has also risen up in response, organizing a fundraising committee to solicit donations from all sectors of industry and commerce, setting a goal of 500,000 yuan for the comfort fund, which will be apportioned among the various industry associations to contribute to the country. From what we can see, we believe that with the scale of Shanghai's hundreds of industries, and with last year's abnormal special prosperity, the amount of 500,000 is actually too small; and we also believe that apportioning it among the various industries will easily gather the sum, but its meaning should be shared by every Chinese resident of Shanghai; so how can we, in addition to apportioning 500,000 yuan among the industries, see the automatic donations and enthusiastic contributions of Chinese residents, so that the results far exceed expectations?</p>
<p>We do not deny that the Spring Festival is a good festival, we do not oppose the liveliness of the Spring Festival, but the residents of the isolated island have long been criticized for being addicted to pleasure, and many people have earned a bad reputation for making a fortune from the national crisis, so how should they save a portion of their Spring Festival spending and contribute it to the War of Resistance, to the country? Then, as the results show, the Spring Festival, while playing with gongs and firecrackers, will be even more impressive!</p>

<h3>Japanese Diet Members Attack Arita's Diplomacy - Parliament Openly Discusses Expelling American Residents in China</h3>
<p>Tokyo. During today's session of the Japanese Diet, member Tang Gu launched a scathing attack on Foreign Minister Arita, criticizing his diplomacy toward Britain and the United States as humiliating. Tang Gu believed that this kind of diplomacy only plunged Japan into difficulties. For example, after Prime Minister Yonai stated in the Diet on the 7th of this month that Japan hoped that the leaders of Chongqing (including Chairman Chiang) would join Wang Jingwei's "new government" in their individual capacities, the United States immediately considered a new loan to China. Tang Gu then questioned Arita, asking him to answer whether the Nine-Power Treaty was still valid and to declare that it no longer existed. However, Arita replied that the Nine-Power Treaty had not yet been abolished. (Associated Press telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, in response to Lower House member Matsumoto's question about whether the Japanese government "advised the United States to withdraw its residents from China," stated, "The Japanese government believes that now is not the time to discuss this serious matter." (Associated Press telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Washington. U.S. State Department officials have taken note of Japanese Foreign Minister Arita's suggestion in parliament yesterday that all American residents withdraw from China, but do not intend to criticize it before receiving a detailed report. There are rumors that the Japanese side will implement measures to undermine American interests in China because the United States has abolished the Treaty of Commerce. Well-informed sources here do not take this seriously. Some believe that if the Japanese side actually undermines American interests in China, the United States will definitely retaliate against Japanese interests in the United States.

<h3>French Cabinet - Reported by Belgian Newspaper to Be Reorganized</h3>
<p>Brussels. According to the "New Metropolitan Daily" here, the French cabinet is about to undergo a major reorganization. Most notably, French Prime Minister Daladier concurrently holds the positions of Minister of Defense and Minister of Foreign Affairs, which is inevitably too much to handle, especially during this time of war, making it even more difficult to attend to everything. Therefore, political figures generally expect Daladier to resign from his concurrent positions as ministers soon. It was previously rumored that the current Foreign Minister, Deli Bo, would be promoted to Foreign Minister, but Deli is not well-known abroad. There is talk of choosing one of the three people to succeed him: former Prime Minister Naval, former Foreign Minister Taylor Bos, and the current Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Missetler. Secondly, both the Minister of Interior and the Minister of Aviation are rumored to be replaced. In particular, Interior Minister Sarraut is older and there is more possibility of change. In addition, Prime Minister Daladier is preparing to expand the foundation of the cabinet during this cabinet reorganization to include both the Radical Republican Party led by Marin on the right and the Socialist Party led by Blum on the left, but the general policy will not change.

<h3>US Government Decides to Continue Economic Aid to China - New Loan of $20 Million Negotiated - A Powerful Reply to Japan's Infringement of Rights</h3>
<p>Washington. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday passed a bill to increase the capital of the Export-Import Bank by one hundred million U.S. dollars, so that the bank can further provide economic assistance to China. At the same time, it also amended the loan bill to China, allowing China to obtain an additional loan of 20 million U.S. dollars. According to Biderman, the proposer of the bill, "The U.S. authorities are now very willing to provide more loans to assist China." According to Jones, the director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, the U.S. is currently conducting new loan negotiations with China. China has applied for a credit loan of 75 million U.S. dollars, secured by tin exports. (Associated Press telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Washington. Amidst the U.S. government's plan to lend the National Government another new loan of 20 million U.S. dollars in the near future, officials announced last night that China has already exceeded the original amount due for the repayment of the 25 million U.S. dollar loan from the U.S. Export-Import Bank to China in 1928. Jones, the chairman of the U.S. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, declared that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee had planned to approve the Export-Import Bank to lend China another 20 million U.S. dollars, but that the loan could not be used to purchase military supplies. Jones denied that part of the 25 million U.S. dollars in 1938 was used to purchase munitions. It is said that China did not use the loan proceeds to purchase aircraft and other military equipment. China's purchases were limited to non-military items only. Jones also announced that in addition to the 25 million U.S. dollar loan granted to the Universal Trading Corporation, which represented the Chinese government, in 1938, the Export-Import Bank had received an additional 16 million U.S. dollars in outstanding Chinese loans, of which 6 million U.S. dollars had already been repaid. The loan was originally 26 million U.S. dollars, divided into two parts. The first part was a 17 million U.S. dollar loan directly granted by the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to the Chinese government for the purchase of cotton and wheat. The second part was a 9 million U.S. dollar loan granted to China by the Food Relief Commission after the Chinese flood in 1931. China is about to exhaust the 25 million U.S. dollars in 1928, but has repaid 2.2 million U.S. dollars with the proceeds from tung oil exports, which is more than the repayment schedule. It is currently in contact with Chinese officials about China repaying the new U.S. loan of 20 million U.S. dollars with tin. China's loan negotiations with the U.S. amount to 75 million U.S. dollars. (Associated Press telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. This morning, the Chinese newspapers here all published the news that the United States intends to lend 20 million U.S. dollars to China in a prominent position. The newspapers believe that the United States is now giving a concrete response to Japan's discrimination against its rights in China. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Japanese Government and Public Are Unusually Concerned, Considering It an Unfriendly Act</p>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma Yakichiro stated that the Japanese government is extremely concerned about the possible news of the United States lending soft loans to China. If the U.S. loan is used for military needs, "the Japanese government will regard this as an extremely serious matter." (Associated Press telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. This morning, newspapers expressed indignation at the United States' policy of "obstructing Japan's establishment of a new order in East Asia," and criticized the United States' plan to lend Chongqing a new loan of 20 million U.S. dollars as an unfriendly act towards Japan, and severely criticized U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson for contacting other third countries to conduct a movement to refuse to recognize the regime. "Hoochi Shimbun" stated that the 80-year-old friendly relationship between the United States and Japan is now in danger of breaking down. The Japanese government is preparing to take countermeasures to cope with the changes. It is now closely watching the future trend of U.S. policy. It is expected that Baron Sakatani Yoshiro will speak out against the U.S. policy toward East Asia at the House of Peers meeting this morning. (Reuters telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>US Far East Policy - Its Position Remains Unchanged - The So-called "New Order in East Asia" - Is Incompatible with the Open Door</h3>
<p>Washington. During the consecutive meetings of the Japanese House of Representatives, some members and Foreign Minister Arita have been involved in the unilateral abolition of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. Officials here remain calm after hearing the news, and said that no matter how Japanese members make inappropriate remarks or issue threats, the policy that the United States is pursuing on the Far East situation is still as described in the note delivered to Japan on December 31, 1938, and will never change. In other words, the rights enjoyed by the United States in China based on the Washington Nine-Power Treaty will still be maintained and will not allow Japan to undermine them with unilateral actions. This position remains unchanged to this day, and there is no change. Moreover, after the expiration of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Commerce in 1911, the U.S. government has been imposing embargoes on Japan at any time, so it can be more calm about the Far East situation. American officials are unwilling to criticize the debate in the Japanese House of Representatives, and only said that this is an internal affair of the country. The U.S. government would rather have Ambassador Grew stationed in Japan explain the situation to the Japanese government authorities at any time, rather than issue a public statement here, so as not to cause repercussions in public opinion and make the tense situation between the U.S. and Japan more severe. (Havas telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita told the Diet Budget Committee yesterday that we must study the issue of abolishing the Nine-Power Treaty to determine whether the issue hinders or promotes the construction of the "new order in East Asia." Kiyose Ichiro's suggestion in the Japanese Diet on Wednesday, the Soviet Union put Outer Mongolia under the Soviet sphere of influence, first "infringed the Nine-Power Treaty," so it is necessary to demand that the government abolish the Nine-Power Treaty to adapt to the "new situation" in the Far East. Japan can abolish the Nine-Power Treaty for the same reason. On Thursday, the "Asahi Shimbun" published a new movement in Japan, arguing that if the United States implements a ban on the import of munitions raw materials to Japan, Japan will announce the abolition of the Nine-Power Treaty.

<h3>New York Financier - Sues Chen Guangfu, etc. - Demanding $1 Million in Compensation</h3>

In Hirsch's lawsuit, he filed a claim against Xi Demao for damages of one million U.S. dollars as compensation for conducting a 30 million U.S. dollar loan to China in 1938.

<p>Tokyo. This morning, Minister of Finance Sakurai explained the special military budget of 4,460,000,000 yuan for the war against China in 1940-41 at the plenary session of the House Budget Committee. He said that the special military budget for the next term includes 2,973,000,000 yuan for special army expenses, 737,000,000 yuan for special navy expenses, and 750,000,000 yuan for reserves. Of the above-mentioned 4,460,000,000 yuan, 3,673,000,000 yuan will have to be raised by issuing public bonds, 600,000,000 yuan will be allocated from general revenue, 158,000,000 yuan will be paid from the special tax levied due to the North China Incident, and the rest will be withdrawn from other revenues. The Minister of Finance also submitted about 11 supplementary budgets. The first item aims to increase the pensions for families of army and navy personnel. The Minister of Finance agreed to economize on the expenses of various government departments to transfer them to the expenses of the various supplementary budgets. (Reuters telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. According to the statistics of the temporary military budget submitted by the Ministry of Finance since the outbreak of the incident until this parliamentary session, the total amount reached 16.455 billion yuan. The source of funds for the 16.491 billion yuan exceeded the amount by 33.6 million yuan.

Government expenditures have been increasing rapidly in recent years. The total amount in the past year was more than four times stronger than the year the incident occurred.

<h3>Wartime Tax Increase Plan - Strong Opposition from Diet Members</h3>
<p>Tokyo. At yesterday's meeting of the House of Representatives, members strongly criticized the 32 bills proposed by the government regarding wartime tax increases, which contained many controversial points. Those who questioned were all worried that after the tax increase, the expansion of industrial production would be hit and fall into crisis. They do not want to see this happen today. It is said that when a secret meeting was held yesterday, the Planning Agency's explanation of the government's material mobilization plan has aroused even more acute disputes. The contents of this plan have not been disclosed so far. According to "Nikkan Shimbun," members of the House of Representatives yesterday felt that the Planning Agency Director's explanation of the material mobilization plan was too abstract and unsatisfactory, so they stopped continuing the discussion and requested that another secret meeting be held today, with government representatives explaining the main details of the plan. The members insisted that the plan was related to the huge 100 million yuan budget proposal and could not be separated. Therefore, they must first know its main contents before they could start discussing the budget proposal, so that they would not be clueless. After the secret meeting yesterday, the president of the Seiyukai and chairman of the House Budget Committee asked the government to provide a detailed explanation and not be too secretive. It is said that the main questions today are whether the expenditures in the budget proposal can be increased and whether the required materials can be purchased with the earmarked funds. It is also said, "We are not asking the government to disclose national defense secrets now. What we want to know is whether the entire industry, and focusing on the materials expected to be used, is sufficient to compensate for the huge and amazing budget proposal. I hope that the government will think from a larger perspective and clarify everything so that the people will be more satisfied. Today, everything is wrapped in secrecy. If such a simple matter is also kept secret, how will the country survive the current emergency?" According to the Ministry of Finance, of the 5,925,000,000 yuan in public bonds that were allowed to be issued within the current fiscal year ending on March 31, 3,078,000,000 yuan has not yet been issued. A total of 1,700,000,000 yuan in public bonds that were allowed to be issued in the previous fiscal year has been transferred to the current fiscal year, roughly half because of the lack of necessary materials, resulting in the failure to use the allocated funds. Therefore, the House of Representatives is requesting the government to provide a more detailed explanation of the material mobilization plan. Hoochi Shimbun today published a photo showing seven members of the Diet sleeping soundly in their seats while the Minister of Finance was speaking in the House of Representatives, and added a comment: "Please pay attention to this unintentionally captured photo, knowing that the 500 million yuan tax increase bill was proposed during this nap."

<h3>French Protest to Japan Over Bombing of Yunnan-Vietnam Railway - US Regards It As a Transportation Artery - Ambassador Grew Urges Japan to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>Tokyo. It has been learned that French Ambassador to Japan Henri has filed a protest with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita regarding the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by Japanese aircraft on Thursday and Saturday. In the air raid on Thursday, five French people were killed or injured, including two women and one child. (Reuters telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. The latest news from Kunming regarding the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway last Thursday has confirmed that the three trains bombed were slow trains, not the "Michelin" express train. The train's locomotive was destroyed, causing several passenger cars to burn. The number of casualties may reach two to three hundred. As far as is currently known, more than one hundred and ten people have died. The news that a French railway employee and his mother and children were killed is particularly tragic. Their names have not yet been announced. According to witnesses of the tragedy, in addition to those who were killed or injured by the bombing, there were quite a few who died from steam flames, boiling water, and landslides. Yunnan-Vietnam passenger cars often have first-class and second-class cars close to the locomotive, so the dead and injured are all foreigners and upper-class Chinese. Chinese sources said that Chinese and Japanese aircraft had several dogfights in the airspace over Kaiyuan (transliteration) on that day, shooting down a Japanese bomber. However, this news has not yet been officially confirmed. (Reuters telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew clearly notified the Japanese government last week that the United States was quite concerned about the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by Japanese aircraft. Grew informed the Japanese government that although it could not be regarded as a formal protest, the notification was meaningful because the relationship between Japan and the United States was already tense. It is said that Grew informed the Japanese government that the U.S. government regarded the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway as a transportation artery for goods shipped to the United States and as an important route for U.S. nationals and diplomats to travel. A reporter learned that the United States used the same notification to arouse the attention of the French Foreign Ministry. (Associated Press telegram, 4th)</p>
<p>Tokyo. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated today while hosting newspaper reporters that French Ambassador to Japan Henri submitted a formal note to Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani Masayuki yesterday, protesting the bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway by aircraft on February 2, which resulted in the death or injury of a number of French people. The Vice Minister replied at the time that the departure of Japanese aircraft was purely for military and strategic necessity. The spokesman continued that if French people were killed as a result, the Japanese government was extremely regretful. The Japanese government will take a reasonable and fair approach to compensate for the loss of life of the people of third countries. The Japanese government's protest to the French government will be given a written reply after further study. (Reuters telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japan Is Willing to Sign Non-Aggression Treaties with the Philippines, India, and the Dutch East Indies - It Does Not Mention Annam Alone - Revealing Its Ambition to Invade Vietnam</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Japanese Foreign Minister Arita told the Diet yesterday that Japan is willing to conclude non-aggression pacts with the Philippines, the Dutch East Indies, India, or any South Sea country, but only on the condition that each country intends to conclude such a pact with Japan. In response to questions about Japan concluding a non-aggression pact with the Dutch East Indies, Arita stated that Japan's southward advance policy does not harbor territorial ambitions, but only wants to develop the resources of the South Sea countries. He said that it is quite reasonable for Japan to conclude non-aggression pacts with the Philippines, the East Indies, and India. (Associated Press telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Arita suggested yesterday in the Japanese Diet that non-aggression treaties be signed with the Philippines, India, and the South Sea countries, but did not mention Annam at all. Observers familiar with current affairs here believe that this is an indication that Japan is preparing to take aggressive action against Annam. If Japan can conquer the wealthy Annam, it can lay a solid foundation for its southward advance policy. Furthermore, after Japan occupied Hainan Island, the Xinnansha Islands, Zhou Island, and recently invaded Guangxi, it felt that Annam was already in its grasp. Japan's ambition is obviously to cut off the United States, Britain, and the Netherlands' assistance to France. (Associated Press telegram, 10th)</p>
<h3>The Japanese Military Is Deeply Mired; Eager for Peace; Yonai's Delusional Hopes for Cooperation Between Chiang and Wang</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government has decided to hold a secret meeting in the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 10th to explain the peace terms concluded between the Japanese government and the "new Chinese government" and other issues related to the handling of the situation. (9th United Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Prime Minister Yonai stated in Parliament today that Japan hopes that the leaders of the Chongqing faction will join the "New Central Government" of Jingwei in their individual capacities, and that Commander-in-Chief Chiang is also welcome. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japanese officials have consistently stated that they do not want to have any relationship with Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Yonai's statement can be described as the first time since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Yonai made this statement in response to a question from Representative Kuboi Michiyoshi. Yonai also stated that Japan can also make considerable concessions to third countries in China, but they must be in line with the spirit of the "New Order in East Asia." If a third country intends to hinder Japan's progress in China, Japan will take a resolute attitude. (7th Associated Press)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Officials here believe that Yonai's statement in the Japanese Parliament yesterday, hoping that leaders of the Chongqing faction would join the organization of Jingwei and saying that Commander-in-Chief Chiang would be welcome if he could join, is "delusional" and not worthy of criticism at all. Yonai's statement either shows a complete lack of understanding of the true situation in free China, or it is intended to deceive the Japanese public, or it is a sign that Japan is eager for peace and compromise. Two years ago, the Japanese government obtained the Emperor's permission to no longer have any dealings with Commander-in-Chief Chiang. Now that Yonai has clearly stated that he welcomes Commander-in-Chief Chiang to cooperate, it is clear that he can no longer maintain his past position. (8th Associated Press)</p>
<p>London: Regarding the rumor from Tokyo that Japan does not oppose Commander-in-Chief Chiang joining a government that includes Wang Jingwei, someone asked a responsible spokesperson in London yesterday whether the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, had mentioned this matter when he spoke with Commander-in-Chief Chiang in Chongqing. The spokesperson replied that London had not received information on the events discussed in Chongqing, but felt that this suggestion may not have been mentioned, as the Chongqing government is the one that can respond to this suggestion, and the Chongqing government has repeatedly made clear its attitude towards cooperation with Japan.

<h3>General Stern Is Transferred Back to the Far East, Proving That Japanese-Soviet Relations Are Not Entirely Satisfactory</h3>
<p>Finland: General Meretskov, Commander of the Leningrad Military District, was originally the commander-in-chief of the Soviet Union's war against Finland. However, due to his lack of success, he was dismissed by the Soviet government and replaced by General Stern, Commander-in-Chief of the Far Eastern Red Army, to continue the battle. According to the "Iltasanomat" newspaper here, General Stern has recently been transferred back to the Far East, proving that relations between Japan and the Soviet Union are not entirely satisfactory. (8th Havas)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Army Minister General Hata Shunroku recently declared in the House of Representatives that since Japan and the Soviet Union signed the Nomonhan Armistice Agreement on September 16th last year, "illegal actions" have continued to occur on the Soviet and "Manchurian border," and everything has not been entirely satisfactory.

<h3>Asama Maru Incident: Anglo-Japanese Compromise; Nine Detained Germans: Britain Agrees to Hand Them Over to Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese Foreign Minister Arita Hachiro stated in the House of Peers today that the British government has the desire to resolve the Asama Maru incident peacefully. Therefore, in a letter received on February 5th, it agreed to hand over nine Germans captured from the "Asama Maru." The date and location of the handover will be agreed upon by both parties. The Japanese government is not satisfied with handing over only a portion of the Germans and will continue to demand that the British side hand over the other twelve Germans. (6th Reuters)</p>
<p>London: Last night, both the British House of Lords and the House of Commons raised questions about the Asama Maru incident. Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax made the same remarks in their replies. The Foreign Secretary stated in the House of Lords that after the British and Japanese governments exchanged documents, "After the twenty-one German passengers of the 'Asama Maru' were arrested, their training and experience were investigated, and it was found that some of them were relatively unsuitable for military service. The British government, while reserving its legal rights, is prepared to release nine Germans. These nine people will be handed over to the appropriate Japanese shipping authorities. At the same time, the Japanese government has instructed its shipping companies to no longer allow people of belligerent countries who belong to the military or are suspected of being military personnel to travel on Japanese ships. The British government maintains its view of its legal position in this matter, but it is expected that incidents similar to the Asama Maru incident will be avoided in the future." (7th Reuters)</p>

<h3>The United States Promotes Peaceful Diplomacy; Begins Contacting Neutral Governments; US Secretary of State Issues Statement on Adjusting the Economy and Reducing Armaments</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull issued a written statement last night stating that, in view of the fact that the neutral countries all show a strong desire for the restoration of world peace, the United States has begun informal diplomatic talks with the governments of the neutral countries. These talks do not involve any specific plan, and their nature is only a preliminary inquiry on (1) a sound international economic system and (2) worldwide arms reduction. These talks can also be extended to belligerent countries, but only limited to the above two common issues related to future peace, and do not include events related to the current war situation. Furthermore, these talks are not related to Under Secretary of State Welles' trip to Europe. It is reported that Hull has summoned the ambassadors and ministers of various countries to the United States and started these talks. According to a representative of the State Department, the talks are not aimed at promoting peace in Europe, but focus on what kind of organization the post-war world should have. Well-informed sources generally believe that it would be a mistake to regard the peace talks with neutral countries as an effort to end the current European war. The purpose of the US government's move is obviously to provide assurances to the neutral countries, especially the smaller ones, that their interests will not be ignored when peace is discussed in the future. The United States will strive to achieve a truly lasting peace, so that it can reduce armaments and restore international commerce. Regarding this point, all the dignitaries have stated in recent public speeches that when the war ends in the future, the United States and other countries will encounter extremely serious difficulties due to the necessary adjustments in commerce and finance. (10th Reuters)</p>
<p>New York: According to a statement from Washington, the US government has decided to do its best to no longer send sharp notes on the issue of neutrality to Britain. All issues between the British and American governments can now be resolved through private talks between American officials in Washington and British Ambassador Lord Lothian, or between British officials and American Ambassador to Britain Joseph Kennedy. According to some officials, in the past two months, the United States has continuously sent strongly worded notes to Britain, which has aroused British feelings to an alarming degree. In fact, the dispute between the two countries is useless and only provides direct encouragement to Hitler. This new policy of the United States naturally depends on whether serious incidents of British infringement of American neutral rights will occur in the future. (6th Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: After issuing the communique, Secretary of State Hull immediately invited the relevant ambassadors to the State Department in stages for talks. This morning, he first met with the Dutch Minister to the United States, Loudon. According to a spokesperson for the State Department, these talks are not aimed at restoring peace in Europe, but are actually related to the issue of the post-war world organization. However, if all the belligerent countries can participate in the talks together, peace may not be impossible to achieve. (9th Havas)</p>
<p>Washington: According to a recently published report, Secretary of State Hull stated to the House Appropriations Committee when he expressed his views on the State Department's annual fee of approximately 20 million yuan that there is no hope for an early peace in Europe at present. Judging from the phenomenon, tension and danger will continue indefinitely. (7th Reuters)</p>
<h3>The US President Sends Welles to Inspect Britain, France, Germany, and Italy; Officials Say He Does Not Have a Formal Negotiation Mission; Only Aims to Obtain Information on the European Situation</h3>
<p>Washington: US Under Secretary of State Welles will now depart for Europe immediately as a personal representative of President Roosevelt in order to seek the most reliable information on the overall situation in Europe. He is scheduled to depart on the Laconia on February 17th, going directly to Italy and then to London and Paris. Berlin may also be visited. The general impression in Washington is that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull want a detailed report from an unbiased source, but this move may not be a prelude to a peace movement. (10th Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt recently issued a written statement to the press stating, "Under Secretary of State Welles, at my request, is scheduled to travel to Britain, France, Germany, and Italy for a short period of time. The sole purpose of his trip is to inspect the current situation in Europe and submit a report to me and Secretary of State Hull, but he has no authority to make suggestions to other countries in the name of the US government or accept any constraints. The statements made to him by the authorities of various countries should also be kept absolutely confidential, and only reported by him to me and Secretary of State Hull." After the President read this written statement, a reporter asked whether Welles intended to meet with German leader Hitler on this trip. The President replied that he did not know. Another asked whether Welles intended to inspect other countries besides Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. The President replied that it had not been determined. A reporter also asked whether Welles was "carrying a letter from the President" on this trip. The President answered no. Finally, the President also stated that Welles was traveling to Europe alone this time, and that no one would be appointed to act as Under Secretary of State during his absence. It is reported that Welles is scheduled to take the Italian mail ship "Rex" to Italy on the 17th of this month. Myron Taylor, the President's personal representative to the Vatican, will also travel with him on the same ship. (9th Havas)</p>
<p>Washington: The Washington "Times" published an essay today explaining the reasons for the US government's dispatch of Under Secretary of State Welles to various European countries for investigation. It is said that (1) President Roosevelt deeply fears that Europe will face a serious crisis this spring. If it can be avoided, not only will the entire Europe not fall into chaos, but also the United States' foreign trade will not be affected. (2) Secretary of State Hull believes that the existence of the world's four major commercial groups affects the security of the US commercial treaties and large amounts of reserves. The so-called four major commercial groups are as follows: A. Countries that have signed clearing agreements with Germany, B. The British Empire and the Sterling Area (including Argentina and Uruguay), C. The Yen Area, and D. The Dollar Area. Hull intends to persuade the neutral countries to restore the international gold standard and unanimously demand a sound economic organization at the future peace conference. (10th Haimun)</p>
<p>London: The local morning newspapers have all praised the fact that US Under Secretary of State Welles will visit Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, but they said that Britain and France have already had a clear idea of the preliminary conditions for peace negotiations and will not change them. (10th Havas)</p>
<p>Berlin: Responsible officials in Berlin expressed great surprise at the United States' dispatch of Under Secretary of State Welles to visit Europe. As of last night, the German Foreign Ministry had not received a formal note. People in Berlin are not commenting on Welles' trip for the time being. (10th Haimun)</p>
<p>New York: Today, local newspapers printed the news of Under Secretary of State Welles' mission to Europe and the State Department's announcement of "peace talks" with various neutral countries in large print. The New York Times' correspondent in Washington called it a "dual offensive for European peace" and the "President's long-awaited peace offensive," and said that if Welles made practical progress in Berlin, it would not be impossible for the US Ambassador to Germany to return to his post. (10th Reuters)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: Today, a correspondent in Berlin for the local radio news agency stated that official circles in Berlin were keeping silent about the fact that US Under Secretary of State Welles was about to visit various European capitals. The correspondent also said that because the warring parties each have completely different goals, it is unlikely that peace can be achieved without a decisive military battle. The Nazi regime has announced that its sole war aim is to destroy Britain's "world hegemony." (—— Reuters)</p>
<p>Rome: Officials here have expressed satisfaction with the US announcement that Under Secretary of State Welles will visit Europe and that the US has begun informal diplomatic talks with the governments of various neutral countries.

<h3>US House of Representatives Reduces Navy Budget</h3>
<p>Washington: The House Appropriations Committee yesterday cut $100,000,000 from the Navy's budget for 1941. However, according to a member of the committee, although the Navy's budget has been reduced, it will not hinder the current shipbuilding program (that is, the program to build 19 ships in 1941). The $20,000,000 for purchasing harbor defense submarine nets was also cut. The purpose of this move is to avoid the $460,000,000 in new taxes estimated by the President. (9th United Press)</p>

<h3>The United States Is Reluctant to Sever Relations with the Soviet Union Prematurely; Hull Writes About Relations Between the Two Countries; American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow Closes</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that the US government firmly believes in "the obligations assumed by the Soviet Union when it resumed diplomatic relations." Hull wrote to Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, describing US-Soviet relations and explaining that the relations between the two countries are "not entirely consistent with the US-Soviet Treaty." In the treaty, the Soviet Union promised not to conduct propaganda in the United States, but on several occasions, the US government believed that the Soviet Union had not fulfilled its promise. When the United States negotiated with the Soviet Union, "satisfactory results were obtained on several occasions, but on several occasions, the Soviet Union's explanations conflicted with the treaty." (9th United Press)</p>
<p>Washington: Senator Vandenberg (Republican), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently requested that Secretary of State Hull sever diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. Hull recently replied in a letter, stating, "When the United States and the Soviet Union resumed diplomatic relations in 1933, the then Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Litvinov, provided several guarantees, which the Soviet government did not fully comply with." However, in the US government's view, the issue of maintaining US-Soviet diplomatic relations should not only depend on whether the Soviet Union complies with the guarantees it has provided. According to custom, whenever the US government believes that another government is not complying with its obligations, it will draw its attention through diplomatic channels. (8th Havas)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to news from here today, the American Chamber of Commerce in the Soviet Union closed its doors today.

<p>Washington: During a meeting of the House of Representatives yesterday, Democratic Representative McCormack proposed an amendment to the State Department's budget bill to eliminate the $175,000 salary for the US Ambassador to the Soviet Union. As a result of the vote, it was rejected by 108 votes to 105. McCormack proposed for the second time an amendment to prevent the State Department from maintaining diplomatic missions in the Soviet Union, which was also not passed by 95 votes to 38.

<h3>Fifteen US Warships Transferred to Pearl Harbor; Large-Scale Pacific Exercise to Begin in April</h3>
<p>Washington: The US Navy Department has transferred fifteen warships, mostly cruisers and destroyers, from San Pedro and San Diego in the United States to the Hawaiian area for exercises. It has been learned from authoritative sources that this transfer is not related to the development of the situation in the Far East. (7th United Press)</p>
<p>Washington: The Navy Department has recently decided to hold spring exercises in the Pacific starting in the first week of April and lasting until the end of May. Approximately 130 warships of various types (excluding submarines), 350 aircraft, 2,400 officers, and 40,000 sailors will participate in the exercises. According to the department's announcement, the program for these exercises will include several special issues caused by the current European war, to the extent possible. Although the department has not announced the location of the exercises, it is generally believed that they will be held within the "triangular defense zone" formed by the Alaskan Peninsula, the Hawaiian Islands, and the Panama Canal Zone.

<h3>French House of Representatives Holds Secret Meeting; Banning Observers</h3>
<p>Paris: The Chamber of Deputies held a meeting this morning. First, the leader of the Socialist Party, Blum, raised questions about the measures that the government intends to take to maximize France's military strength, and requested that observers be banned. Although Prime Minister Daladier expressed his opposition, the Chamber of Deputies ultimately decided to do so by a majority of 262 votes to 227. As a result, all the people in the audience and the journalists withdrew, and the Chamber of Deputies immediately held a secret meeting. In addition, five members of parliament raised questions about the government's general war policy. Prime Minister Daladier immediately revealed the activities of the German political police in France, saying that the local authorities had recently seized many documents, including a questionnaire, which should be answered item by item by the staff of the German political police. Thereupon Prime Minister Daladier presented the questionnaire and read it out. The most important questions were "Is Daladier loved by the French masses?" "What is his prestige like?" "When the Chamber of Deputies votes on a motion of confidence, how many votes can he get?" "Who are his political friends and who are his political enemies?" "Does France trust the Arab and black soldiers in its colonies?" "What is the number of French police and how is the National Directorate of Investigations organized?" The Prime Minister finally added, "There are quite a few German political police officers engaged in espionage in France. These people's attempts to undermine our national morale will surely fail." (9th Havas)</p>
<p>Paris: After the Chamber of Deputies met today, the Presidium issued a bulletin stating, "The Chamber of Deputies held two secret meetings today to discuss the issue of national defense organization. All the members were driven by patriotism and a spirit of harmony. Therefore, nothing untoward happened during the discussions. The Chamber of Deputies has now decided to continue holding secret meetings tomorrow." (9th Havas)</p>

<h3>The Balkan Consultation Countries Continue to Unite and Extend the Consultation Convention for Seven Years, Changing Economic Ties and Transportation</h3>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - The Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries held its eighth meeting this afternoon in the Yugoslav capital. Afterwards, Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu read a public statement, the full text of which is as follows: "The Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries, in this meeting, the representatives of each country were able to exchange opinions in an atmosphere of friendship and mutual trust, and the following results have been achieved: (1) The consultation countries all recognize that maintaining peace, order, and security in Southeast Europe is in their common interest; (2) Regarding the current European war, the consultation countries have decided to continue to implement a peaceful policy, maintain the current status, and ensure that the war does not spread to Southeast Europe; (3) The Balkan Consultation Convention was not initially concluded to target any other country. The consultation countries have decided to continue to unite within the scope of the convention and pay joint attention to the protection of the rights, independence, and national territories of each country; (4) The consultation countries are willing to maintain and develop friendly relations with all neighboring countries in a spirit of mutual understanding, peaceful cooperation, and compromise; (5) The consultation countries all recognize that it is necessary to improve the economic ties and transportation of the Balkan Peninsula countries, and in particular, the Balkan Consultation Countries should seek economic and transportation improvements by developing mutual trade; (6) The Balkan Consultation Convention will expire on February 9th of next year, and it has now been decided to extend it for seven years, until February 9th, 1948; (7) The next Standing Political Council meeting is scheduled to be held in the capital of Greece in February of next year. During this year, the foreign ministers of the consultation countries have decided to maintain close contact and exchange opinions at any time." (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - The public statement issued today by the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries has just been commented on by observers here, who say that Southeast Europe is about to establish a true "regional consultation." Because the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River basin are inherently united in terms of interests and form a separate region, a regional consultation must be established sooner or later. Romanian Foreign Minister Gafencu has already expressed this intention in his speech yesterday. In addition, there is a sentence in the public statement that says, "The four consultation countries have decided to unite and pay joint attention to the protection of the rights, independence, and national territories of each country." This sentence is extremely important. The public statement does not use the phrase "territorial integrity," but instead uses "national territories," which is actually a major concession in spirit to Bulgaria and Hungary. (Havas News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Turkish and Bulgarian Foreign Ministers Hold Talks</p>
<p>Sofia - Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu arrived here today from Niš. When Saracoğlu passed through here on his way to the Yugoslav capital, he held talks with Bulgarian Foreign Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov. He decided to come here to continue the previous talks. It is also reported that Bulgarian King Boris will invite Saracoğlu to lunch at a suburban palace. People here generally believe that the time for concrete developments is not far away. Although Bulgaria is disappointed with the results announced by the Belgrade meeting, it still earnestly hopes that Saracoğlu can bring a promise of support from the Balkan Consultation Countries, so that Bulgaria's territorial demands can be met through local negotiations. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>Germany and Italy Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>Berlin - German officials are very satisfied with the results of the Balkan Consultation Conference, as the countries declared their intention to maintain peace and neutrality, which has been the goal of Germany's efforts for months. Germany is extremely concerned about peace and neutrality in Southeast Europe and is willing to do its best to help the Balkan countries achieve that goal. Germany is a major buyer of products from Southeast European countries, especially Romanian oil. Therefore, purely for economic reasons, Germany also hopes that peace in Southeast Europe can be maintained. According to recent comments and observations in the British and French press, the British and French governments deeply hope that as a result of this Balkan conference, the Southeast European countries can form an anti-German bloc under the leadership of Turkey. However, this attempt has clearly failed. In order to maintain neutrality, Romania and Yugoslavia have pressured Turkey to adopt a more conservative attitude. Therefore, this Balkan conference was a failure for British and French diplomats. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Rome - After the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries closed its meeting, political figures here expressed satisfaction with the results of the meeting and agreed that the consultation countries had repeatedly declared their intention to maintain neutrality and independence. They also said that the countries' declaration of willingness to maintain friendly relations with neighboring countries and to find ways to improve diplomatic relations was probably referring to Bulgaria and Hungary. However, empty words are of no use. The consultation countries, especially Romania, should make concessions to Bulgaria and Hungary as soon as possible in order to establish lasting peace in Southeast Europe. In addition, the "Fascist Labor Daily" stated, "At this moment, the impact of the current European war on the neutral countries, especially the economic impact, can no longer be ignored. Therefore, the desire of the Balkan Consultation Countries lies in organizing peace and thereby maintaining it." (Havas News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris - News from Germany claims that the Black Sea coastal countries, Turkey, Bulgaria, and Romania, are about to sign a so-called Black Sea agreement to deal with the Soviet Union. This statement has been denied by French diplomatic officials. (Havas News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>Greek Prime Minister Delivers a Speech</p>
<p>Athens - General Metaxas, the Greek Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, who recently attended the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries in the Yugoslav capital, has now returned here via Thessaloniki. Before departing from Thessaloniki, he delivered a speech, saying, "The period we are currently experiencing is full of difficulties and there is a risk of being drawn into the vortex of war. Fortunately, we have a firm will and would rather be shattered jade than whole tile, and we are able to stay out of the war. I do not mean that we will necessarily be able to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war for a long time (this is what I deeply desire and will do my best to achieve). However, even if we are unfortunately drawn into the storm in the future, we will certainly be able to reach the other shore safely and gain the respect of people all over the world. The recent meeting of the Standing Political Council of the Balkan Consultation Countries was successful because the Balkan Consultation Countries do not want to provoke any country, nor do they want to harm anyone. On the contrary, they are extremely willing to cooperate with other countries in the Balkan Peninsula and the Danube River basin. In short, we are united, unafraid of storms, and determined to maintain peace, but we are also determined to make others respect our national survival and independence." (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Army Has Begun a Full-Scale Offensive Against Finland and Has Achieved Victory in Karelia. Finland Denies That the Mannerheim Line Has Been Breached.</h3>
<p>London - According to news from neutral sources here, the Soviet army has resumed its massive efforts to break through the Mannerheim Line and is currently developing the most intense offensive since the beginning of the war. The recent Soviet offensive has spread throughout Karelia, and there are fierce battles on all other lines. According to a semi-official announcement issued by the Finnish army, the Soviet army launched an offensive yesterday in the weakest area of the Mannerheim Line, the Summa sector, but made no progress. The Soviet army has also launched new offensives in Perkjärvi and Pasuri, first with long-range artillery fire, then with aircraft bombing and strafing Finnish positions, and finally with tanks and infantry launching ground attacks. The front line along the Taipale River, which has been quiet for a long time, is now also under attack, which shows the scale of the current Soviet offensive. There is new activity further north in Salla and Sakkijärvi. The Finnish army believes that the Soviet army's large-scale offensive is intended to show Finland the Soviet power before the end of February, as snowfall will occur again by the end of February and the war will be temporarily suspended. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The Soviet communique today mentioned for the first time the fighting in the Summa sector of Finland, saying that the Soviet army, in its offensive against the Mannerheim Line, has occupied the defensive area of Hotti, seized several artillery positions, and inflicted heavy casualties on the Finnish army.

<p>Helsinki - The Finnish army in the Summa area is determined to repel the largest Soviet offensive since the beginning of the war with an indomitable spirit. Previously, the Soviet army had launched fierce offensives in the northeast of Lake Ladoga and in the Summa area, but all of them failed.

<h3>The Soviet Union's Armistice Conditions for Finland Are Transferred to the Finnish Government by the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union.</h3>
<p>Stockholm - This morning, high-ranking political figures here said that the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, has met with representatives of the Soviet government and obtained the conditions that the Soviet side intends to propose to Finland. It is reported that Steinhardt first went to Tallinn, then flew via Riga and Stockholm to Helsinki to deliver the Soviet demands to the Finnish government. It is expected that he will arrive in Turku on the 12th. Because Steinhardt was previously the U.S. Minister to Sweden, people here hope that he can stay in Stockholm for a day to have contact with Swedish government officials. Regarding the nature of the Soviet demands, all well-informed sources are taking a silent attitude. Some say that its main purpose is to negotiate armistice conditions. Diplomatic officials here point out that the Soviet Union has recognized the so-called "Finnish People's Government" and may want to extend the authority of that government to the territory that the Soviet Union demands Finland cede. According to diplomatic observers, the territory that the Soviet Union wants Finland to cede should include Hanko Port and Hogland, Lavasaari, Tytärsaari, Koivisto Island, and the Karelian Isthmus. The Soviet Union may cede territory in the north to compensate Finland. (Haitong News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Reports on the Military and Diplomatic Situation in the House of Commons. The Link Between Britain and France Is Becoming Stronger. Britain and Greece Establish an Economic Agreement.</h3>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon, as usual, reporting on the military and diplomatic situation last week. First, he said that the Supreme Defense Committee of Britain and France recently held another joint meeting in Paris. He felt that the importance of this type of meeting was increasing day by day. It was not only a medium for communicating the views of the two countries, but also a major tool for conducting the war and seeking victory. He also believed that this meeting was not only of greater value than previous meetings, but also more pragmatic. In short, Britain and France have established an understanding, which is a major factor in achieving ultimate victory. Although the enemy is trying to alienate Britain and France, it is actually in vain. It should be known that the link between Britain and France is even greater than a close alliance. In addition, both sides share the same goals and share weal and woe, so this link is becoming stronger. In terms of the international situation, the Balkan Consultation Countries held a meeting in the Yugoslav capital at the beginning of the month and decided to do everything possible to maintain the stability of Southeast Europe, which is most welcome. In addition, the British government has conducted negotiations with a Greek delegation, and the process was extremely harmonious. Both sides have reached a satisfactory agreement on a number of financial and economic issues, which is gratifying. In terms of the war, German aircraft have recently repeatedly attacked small ships of various countries off the coast of Britain. This deliberate and barbaric means of aerial attack is not war, but massacre. As for our country's air force, with the assistance of naval patrol fleets, it recently sank a German submarine, which is vastly different from the German aircraft's attacks on neutral ships. Moreover, this kind of bandit behavior by Germany has little impact on the outcome of the war. The revulsion and anger it has aroused in all civilized countries has made our determination to fight to the end, to eliminate this ferocious evil for the sake of human civilization, even stronger. It is difficult to predict at this time how much longer the war will have to continue and how many difficulties we will have to encounter, but we have no reason to express dissatisfaction with the initial stage of this war. Therefore, we still look forward to the future with calm determination and firm faith. (Havas News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>London - During the House of Commons meeting yesterday, a question was raised as to whether the government would consider sending bombers and fighter jets, as well as pilots, to assist Finland.

According to what he heard, Finnish pilots can operate any aircraft currently available. Butler also said in response to various supplementary questions that the British government is very aware of Finland's need for assistance. (Reuters, 8th)</p>

<p>Love During the Joyful Spring Festival</p>
<p>…Should grow vigorously!</p>
<p>Love seems to have a close relationship with the season and environment. Because our hearts are most flexible, they have a responsive effect with the outside world at all times. If in a barren and lonely desert, any lush sprout of love would probably be subject to destruction and wither! Then, in this Spring Festival where thousands of families are brightly lit and everyone is happy, the sprouts of love in the hearts of young men and women will surely grow vigorously and be filled with splendid flowers!</p>
<p>Friends! Speaking of this, I hope you don't think that love is a luxury! Although it grows in a relatively comfortable environment, it is an essential thing in a healthy life. This is like a seedling that must go through a period of flowering and fruiting. If it cannot flower or bear fruit, that is its defect. Defects cause pain in life, leaving behind eternal regrets!</p>
<p>There is evidence to prove that during this happy Spring Festival, if there are couples or lovers who are healthy and beautiful, they will definitely live a lingering and sweet life, having sons and daughters, and a happy family. How happy life is! But if a man has committed masturbation in his early years, early marriage and indulgence, or is out of balance after illness, worry and new injuries, and has damaged the endocrine fluids in his reproductive glands, then symptoms such as kidney deficiency and impotence, incomplete development, loss of energy, kidney deficiency and infertility, and neurasthenia will abound. Such a sick man, even if he encounters the Spring Festival with a beautiful wife in his arms, he will certainly not be interested. As for the sexual life that is the foundation of love between husband and wife, it is always like a flash in the pan, or even completely powerless. How can this not make his wife hate him and plunge love into destruction? A couple without love is like living with an enemy, and there is no greater pain in life than this!</p>
<p>To remove pain and enjoy happiness, it is essential to cure the disease and improve health. To achieve this goal, according to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking "Shengzhi Su," a preparation made from healthy animal reproductive gland essence, is the most effective treatment. Because this agent has precious materials, excellent supervision, and sure effect, its tonic power is great, and it is unmatched by all similar preparations. Therefore, it has the widest sales and the longest history, and is unanimously praised by Chinese and Western doctors. After taking this agent, patients can produce essence, nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain, activate blood, nourish nerves, and promote development in one day and night. Taking it continuously for one month will surely cure all symptoms, double energy, and middle-aged and elderly people who take it regularly will prolong life and rejuvenate. However, those who suffer from spermatorrhea must also take the special medicine "Ximitushi Gujing Pian" (available at Chinese and Western pharmacies such as Wuzhou Huaying Taihe and the Western medicine department of Wing On Company, priced at two yuan per box) to consolidate the sperm gate and stop the leakage, and the effect will be even faster.</p>
<h3>Spermatorrhea Can Make Young People Dull</h3>
<p>– (Venereal Disease Physician Nian Zeng)</p>
<p>Many parents are surprised to say: Why is our child getting more and more stupid? In fact, according to psychological arguments, there is no reason for a child to become more stupid as they grow older. The development of intelligence can be roughly divided into five periods: one to five years old is infancy, six to twelve years old is childhood, thirteen to eighteen years old is adolescence, nineteen to twenty-five years old is adulthood, and twenty-six to forty years old is prime of life. Among these periods, the fastest development of intelligence is during adolescence, and the highest point of development is during adulthood. The intelligence of prime of life may decline slightly, but the decrease is very small. After that, during middle age and old age, it will gradually decline. According to this, a child from infancy to childhood to adolescence to adulthood, intelligence only continues to grow and increase, especially in adolescence. At this time, it is the period when spring passion is activated, and the endocrine fluid in the reproductive glands in the body is extremely active. Therefore, it stimulates the development function, the body suddenly grows taller, the complexion glows, the voice increases, the beard gradually grows, and the temperament turns to be brave and generous. Seeing healthy and beautiful women, there is a desire to court them. At this time, intelligence also greatly increases. Problems that were considered difficult to solve in childhood can be easily solved at this time. Thoughts are rich, and memory is strong. …With the above evidence, we have clearly known that reproductive gland endocrine fluid (i.e., semen) has a great relationship with intelligence. However, young people do not cherish themselves, commit masturbation, or have early marriage and indulgence, or worry and hurt, destroying the sexual nerves, and causing the sperm gate to relax, then spermatorrhea will follow. If suffering from spermatorrhea and delaying treatment, the nerves of the brain, spinal cord, and sexual organs will be in a state of atrophy due to lack of nourishment, developmental function will stagnate, and metabolism will decrease. As a result, brain power weakens, memory loss and insomnia occur, and thoughts become muddled. Those who were smart in the past are now dull and stupid. At the same time, they must have a sallow complexion and thin muscles, an unattractive appearance, or even waist pain and back pain, kidney atrophy and premature ejaculation, incomplete development and other symptoms will arise one after another. Such young people not only have difficulty in studying and no hope in learning a trade, but are also abandoned by women and hated by wives and concubines, falling into the most tragic situation in the world!</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is not an incurable disease. Just take the special medicine "Ximitushi Gujing Pian," and it can consolidate the sperm gate that night, calm the nerves, and have the effect of sleeping and stopping spermatorrhea, nourishing the mind and strengthening the brain. If spermatorrhea has been for a long time and has the above symptoms, you must also take "Shengzhi Su," a preparation made from healthy animal reproductive gland essence, to nourish the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves, and you will definitely be able to cure all symptoms. However, if patients can come to our clinic in person and apply new therapies such as electrotherapy and injection, it can be guaranteed to be cured.</p>
<h3>From Congratulating the Spring New Year to Women's Breast Development and Good Fortune</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>In the happy Spring Festival, when meeting each other, one must say, "Congratulations on the New Year," or "Welcome fortune in the New Year." Today, the author meets you for the first time, and not only must say to you deeply, "Congratulations on the New Year," and "Welcome fortune in the New Year," but also say to the female compatriots a sincere and earnest "Breast Development and Good Fortune"!</p>
<p>What is the meaning of "Breast Development and Good Fortune"? You may have some doubts, but please close your eyes and think for a moment, and you will know that what the author calls "Breast Development and Good Fortune" is to have all female compatriots get real happiness from today onwards, and the so-called real happiness must first start with breast development. Because the times are advancing, and health is the source of all happiness. In today's aesthetic concepts that are very different from the past, if the breasts are destroyed by tight breasts, self-indulgence, leukorrhea, infertility, irregular menstruation, malnutrition, multiple births and weakness, forming looseness, atrophy, or flatness like a man, then not only is health and beauty lost, and there are no curves in the social arena, and there is no way to look around and win the favor of men, but even in the Spring Festival, there is only sorrow in the heart, and feelings arise from seeing the scenery, sighing that I was not born at the right time! What happiness is there to speak of? To seek remedy, I deeply hope to take the opportunity to rise up and, at the beginning of the return of spring to the earth, actively take the reproductive gland ovarian endocrine preparation "Shengzhi Su" for women, then it can nourish the ovarian function in one day and night, enhance metabolism, regulate menstruation, and warm the uterus to stop leukorrhea. If you continue to take it and persevere, not only can the atrophied breasts be made to bulge high, firm and elastic, but also the thin buttocks can become plump. In addition, it can also darken hair, beautify the face, eliminate disease and strengthen the body. The effect is great, and the tonic power is magnificent, which is unmatched by any organ and life-saving preparation. It has been proven by Chinese and Western doctors, so it has been popular for ten years, and it has become more and more popular over time.</p>

<p>Full of Vigor</p>
<p>This month, the 8th to the 10th is the 29th year of the Spring Festival. Citizens from all walks of life believe that the military situation of the War of Resistance has entered a favorable stage. The Japanese army is deeply mired and unable to make progress. The national belief in the War of Resistance is becoming more and more firm. It is deeply believed that the final victory will surely come. As the Spring Festival begins, the spring sunshine is bright, the warm wind is gentle, and the earth is full of vitality, which further symbolizes the bright future of China.

Various organizations in this city, taking February 10 as the date for the general mobilization of the Spring Festival Army Appreciation in various parts of the country, jointly telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to express respect, and expressed their support for the national policy of resistance to the end. The original text said: "Chongqing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, since the July 7th Incident, Your Excellency has led the military and civilians to carry out the sacred all-out War of Resistance. For more than two years, relying on the hard work of the heroic soldiers and the common hatred of the enemy throughout the country, a foundation for the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance and the inevitable success of national reconstruction has been laid. All of us descendants of the Yan and Huang emperors are energized and redoubled our efforts to always support the national policy of resistance to the end. As the Spring Festival begins, we hereby send a telegram to express our respect and wish for victory. Shanghai various organizations kowtow."</p>
<p>Spring Festival Army Appreciation. According to the Shanghai Spring Festival Army Appreciation Fundraising Committee's regulations, the fundraising procedures are as follows: The Shanghai Spring Festival Army Appreciation Movement stipulates that the comfort money is 500,000 yuan in national currency, which is jointly and separately apportioned by various industry associations in the Shanghai business community. The amount is determined by the fundraising committee and issued to each member store and firm by the industry association in accordance with the number. After collecting the donated funds, each industry association or organizing body shall transfer the funds to the Central Bank for remittance. For convenience, the fundraising committee will attach a remittance slip from the Central Bank to each association, which can be filled out and sent directly to the bank. However, the receipt stub shall be submitted to the fundraising committee for verification.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Ticket Subscriptions. The Shanghai Spring Festival Army Appreciation Movement will be held from February 1st to February 29th. However, in fact, the "January 28th" Shanghai War Memorial Day has already begun to be promoted. Currently, the subscribed amount for each industry has exceeded 300,000 yuan. At the same time, individuals are also very enthusiastic in making automatic contributions. The industry associations are actively conducting fundraising from member stores and firms in order to concentrate and transfer the funds, and with the enthusiastic participation of all parties, it is expected that the full amount of fundraising will be completed as scheduled to comfort the loyal and brave soldiers fighting in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>Refugees Seeking Help. As the old lunar year draws to a close, various charitable organizations have unanimously and earnestly appealed for assistance due to the high prices and the difficulty in providing relief to refugees. At the same time, in the severe winter, refugees still lack supplies to protect themselves from the cold. The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Civil Group, Hometown Group, Industry Group, Amateur Troupe Group, Dance Hall Group Fundraising Committees, and the Shanghai International Relief Committee and Charity Federation have received a large number of donations in recent days, and have not taken a holiday during the Spring Festival.</p>
<h3>It is Reported that Xiaoshan has been Recovered. The Whole City is Delighted. Shipping Between Shanghai and Ningbo is Normal. The Haiford is Sailing Smoothly to Zhenhai.</h3>
<p>A certain shipping company in this city received a telegram from Ningbo at 10:50 AM yesterday, which briefly stated, "The Chinese army recovered Xiaoshan on the afternoon of the 9th. Ningbo heard the good news and the emotions are excited," etc. People from Zhejiang Province in Shanghai immediately spread the news, and their spirits were joyful. All walks of life in the city were also extremely delighted. As for the shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, it has been smooth and unobstructed since the outbreak of the war in eastern Zhejiang. The Haiheford of Lihe Foreign Company is scheduled to set sail for Zhenhai at 3:00 PM on the 12th. The Deping of Zhongyuan Company is also scheduled to open Zhenhai on the same day. However, due to the suspension of goods by merchants in eastern Zhejiang, the above two rounds only carry passengers and do not carry large quantities of goods.</p>
<h3>After a Smooth Passage Through the General Closing Period, Various Industries Will Open Tomorrow. The Abnormal Development of Shanghai has Benefited Greatly. The Financial Market is Sound and Stable as Always.</h3>
<p>After a smooth passage through the general closing period of the 28th year of the Republic of China, money houses and money exchange houses will be listed on the market on the 12th, and banks will open at the same time after the spring holidays. Various stores, factories, companies, and firms will resume business after the God of Wealth Day. Last year, due to the abnormal development of the concession area, various industries have benefited greatly. The details of the people's emotions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Money Houses and Money Exchange Houses Report Listing. The members of the Money Industry Association, including Huihua Qianzhuang Xianyuan, Yida, Baofeng, etc., and the Yuan, Heng, Li, and Zhen Qianzhuang will report to the Ningbo Road Association Market for listing from the 12th (Monday). The Market Management Committee will publicize the listing of each Zhuang for public knowledge. The members of the Money Exchange Industry Association, Fu, Lu, Shou, Xi, Qian Exchange Zhuang, have been engaged in various speculative matters since the war, such as buying and selling black market foreign exchange and remittance of discounted currencies of various countries, securities, dark markets, etc., so that they have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. These Qian Exchange Zhuang will also be listed and operated from the 12th.</p>
<p>Banks Resume Business and Various Industries Open. The member banks and trust companies of the Banking Association will take a spring holiday for four days from February 8th and will open for business after the spring holiday on the 12th. As for various companies, firms, factories, stores, etc., they will all take a holiday for four days after the general closing and will fully open for business after the God of Wealth Day. Regarding the business of various industries last year, according to the New Voice News reporter's inquiry to the parties concerned, the war-torn concession area has undergone abnormal development, and various industries have benefited greatly due to hoarding of goods and other reasons, especially the textile, cotton weaving, yarn flower, silk weaving, flour, grain, Western medicine, paint, foreign sundries, cotton cloth and other industries.</p>
<p>Financial Market. Sustained Stability</p>
<p>The Shanghai financial market has remained stable and unchanged after the regulation and adjustment by the four banks of China, Central, Transportation, and Agriculture and the preparatory committee of the silver and money industry. There is no tension at all. The deposits of the silver and money industries have increased sharply, and the overall capital has become surplus, creating various speculative businesses, such as buying and selling foreign exchange securities, hoarding goods, real estate businesses, etc., which have caused prices to skyrocket, affecting the livelihoods of ordinary people. Although the financial market has been subjected to rumors by speculators and certain parties in an attempt to disrupt and profit, the destruction plan has ultimately failed due to the sound and effective financial policy of China during the war.</p>
<p>Silver and Money Industries Have Made Great Profits. A reporter from New Voice News inquired in the financial community yesterday about the business situation of the silver and money industries last year: (1) In addition to the four banks of China, Central, Transportation, and Agriculture, other commercial banks earned profits ranging from 50,000 to 10 million yuan, but the most formal reported profits were only more than 1 million yuan, and the dividends issued ranged from 5% to 10%. Some major banks even earned huge profits by operating black market foreign exchange. (2) Money houses mainly focus on credit lending. Last year, due to the abnormal development of various industries, the accounts released were all recovered, so all houses were able to make profits ranging from 5,000 to 500,000 yuan, and only a few reported flat profits. Under the permitted business conditions,</p>
<h3>Understanding Employees. Under the Permitted Business Conditions, Treatment Must be Improved Appropriately</h3>
<p>On the fifth day of the lunar New Year, commonly known as the God of Wealth Day, on the eve of that day, various companies and firms often set up banquets to entertain colleagues, which is called the God of Wealth Wine, and the advancement and retreat of employees are also determined at this time. The First Special District Citizens' Federation of this city sincerely and respectfully informs the capital parties of various industries not to dismiss employees at will during this extraordinary period, briefly stating that in this extraordinary period, coordination between labor and capital is the most important thing. After the Shanghai war, due to the special environment and concentrated population, the business of various industries is still not bad. It is hoped that the capital parties will remember the shared hardships and give preferential treatment to the employees, and do not make too many changes or dismiss employees at will, and under the permitted business conditions, improve the treatment appropriately. The same is expected.</p>
<h3>Asama Maru Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday from the United States. Will Sail to Hong Kong This Morning</h3>
<p>The Asama Maru, a passenger ship of the American-Asia Line of the Japanese Dalian Steamship Company, was searched by the British Navy and arrested 21 German passengers on the British sea last month and escorted to Hong Kong for detention. The Japanese side had raised a protest with the British Navy authorities on this matter. It is learned that the Asama Maru arrived in Shanghai from Los Angeles via Honolulu. San Francisco. Yokohama.

<h3>The Chinese New Army Has Received Excellent Training. Prepared with New Weapons to Open the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River. Jardine Matheson's British Ship was Again Bombed by Japanese Aircraft. An Expatriate from Yichang, Xue Fa Xun, Talked About It in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Mainland Daily reported that Xue Fa Xun, an expatriate from Yichang, arrived in Shanghai on Thursday. According to him, the national spirit in western China is high, and the river transportation between Yichang and Chongqing is endless. Wounded soldiers are attached to the cotton transport ships upstream. The new army coming downstream has received the best training and is equipped with new and sophisticated weapons. The troops are dispatched without any mess. After landing in Yichang, they take trucks to Shashi and then transfer to the front line of the Han River. Xue had inspected a batch of new machine guns with friends and claimed that they were reported by Sweden. It is common for Japanese planes to fly over Yichang. On August 6, Xue saw two British ships of Jardine Matheson being hit by Japanese bombers who dived and dropped bombs, causing a fire. Japanese aircraft constantly bombard the Yangtze River traffic, so the navigation of ships is very cautious. According to Xue, he is the owner of an oil tanker and left Yichang for Chongqing at the end of January, and then flew to Hong Kong to Shanghai, and will return to Yichang soon.</p>

<h3>Negotiations for Road Construction Beyond the Settlement: Announcement to be Released Next Week - What Philippo Spoke About After Returning from a Trip South - Announcement Will Contain Mutually Agreed-Upon Recommendations</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that Mr. Philippo, Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC), told reporters yesterday (the 9th) that an announcement regarding the negotiations between the SMC and the "Shanghai Municipal Government" would be released early next week. He did not wish to comment on the negotiations at this time because, since his return to Shanghai from a vacation in the south, he was</p>
<p>somewhat unfamiliar with the city's development. He would need some time to familiarize himself with these developments. When asked about his impressions of Singapore, Mr. Philippo replied that he had nothing to report, other than that he had enjoyed a good rest. Sources close to the SMC stated that Mr. Philippo, after returning to Shanghai on the afternoon of Thursday the 4th, had</p>
<p>held multiple meetings with the acting officials who had been in charge during his absence, and had received detailed reports. It is widely rumored that the SMC and the puppet municipal government have already reached a compromise regarding the road areas outside the settlement. Although this has not yet been officially confirmed, well-informed sources believe that Mr. Philippo's upcoming announcement will reveal that both parties have</p>
<p>agreed on recommendations. According to the Continental Daily News's earlier predictions, this agreement will stipulate the establishment of a joint committee to manage police affairs in the road areas beyond the settlement. The "Shanghai Municipal Government" will appoint a police chief, and the SMC will appoint a deputy police chief. The headquarters staff will consist of 40 people, with each party appointing half. All personnel appointed by one party must be approved by the other party.</p>
<p>Negotiations Stalled Regarding Police Rights in the Northern District: The SMC has been negotiating with the Japanese regarding the signing of an agreement for the northern district, encompassing Hongkou and Yangshupu. The SMC hopes to restore the situation as it existed before the August 13th Incident. It is reported that negotiations stalled last week and are on the verge of collapse. The negotiations regarding police rights and the agreement for the northern district have been conducted in great secrecy, much like the issue of road construction beyond the settlement. Regarding the northern district agreement, in addition to Director-General Philippo, who returned to Shanghai on the 8th,</p>
<p>the decision-making process depends on the arrival of Chairman Fessenden in Shanghai. Regarding the agreement, the SMC insists on restoring the police rights it held in the northern district before the August 13th Incident. The Japanese side claims that the Japanese sentry posts on the North Sichuan Road Bridge must be withdrawn by May 1st of next year. After the withdrawal of the Japanese sentry posts, the Japanese authorities reportedly demanded that the SMC increase the number of</p>
<p>Japanese police officers in order to strengthen their presence in the northern district, as the Japanese side deems it necessary. It is understood that the area north of the Suzhou Creek was almost completely destroyed by artillery fire during the street fighting that followed the August 13th Incident in 1937. The Chinese army retreated westward in November.</p>
<h3>Employees of Two Railways Borrow Living Subsidies</h3>
<p>Employees of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have been suffering from prolonged unemployment and hardship. They requested that the railway management office find a way to provide relief. It was agreed, after discussion with the savings fund association, that each person could borrow ten yuan from the association's remaining funds as a relief loan. This was previously reported. It is now learned that the deadline for these loans will be the end of February. Any employees who have not yet applied for a loan can directly submit an application to No. 39 Beijing Road, requesting approval for the loan.</p>
<h3>Lunar New Year: Foreign Vessel Voyages - Scheduled Arrival of Postal Ships in Shanghai - Sluggishness of Yangtze River Vessels</h3>
<p>A record of the movements of Chinese and foreign routes during the Lunar New Year: For the Europe-Asia route, the French postal ship "D'Artagnan" of the French Mail Steamship Company is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow (the 12th). The Italian Mail Steamship Company's unscheduled ship,</p>
<p>the "Himalaya," is also scheduled to arrive tomorrow. The exact arrival times of both ships have not yet been determined. For the Pacific route, the American President Lines' "President Taft" previously suffered damage to its propeller on its return voyage from Manila and entered dry dock in Hong Kong for repairs. It is now learned that the ship is scheduled to depart from Hong Kong for Shanghai around the 12th and is expected to arrive on the 15th. The company's</p>
<p>"President Cleveland" is also returning to Shanghai from Manila and is expected to arrive on the 14th, departing for Japan and returning to the United States on the 15th. The schedules of British ships operating on the Chinese coastal routes have not been announced due to the European war. It is learned that the Danish company Jebsen Shipping's</p>
<p>"Meihing," managed by the Qiaocheng Shipping Company, is scheduled to sail directly to Hong Kong on the 15th. All ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo route are in Zhenhai. The Sino-Italian Company's "Deping" may arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, and if so, it will sail to Ningbo on the 14th or 15th. Navigation to ports on the lower Yangtze River (Jingjiang County) and (Taizhou County, i.e., Longwukou) is entirely monopolized by Japanese merchants. Ships operating to the above ports cannot load or unload cargo unless they fly the Japanese flag. Even German ships such as the "Haikang" and "Luan" are experiencing sluggish business. Consequently, after</p>
<p>suspending service at the end of the lunar year, their resumption is uncertain. The "Haiyi" has already changed its route to Lihu, and ships operating to Hai (Beihe) and Qidong are also facing considerable threats. These situations have been reported in previous issues. Therefore, the Swire Company's "Wulin" returned to Shanghai empty yesterday morning. The Jardine Matheson Company's "Tonghe" sailed empty to Beisha in order to maintain the route. It is not possible to predict when it will return to Shanghai. Therefore, the schedules of these two</p>
<p>British ships are uncertain. The German company Jebsen &amp; Jessen's "Kastell," which originally operated to Hupu, Changyinsha, and the new ports north of the Yangtze River, has changed to the Beisha route due to difficulties in cargo transportation. It is now scheduled to depart tomorrow evening. The sailing date for the "Lisha" has not been determined. The Fuhua Company's "Dingjiang" has not yet determined when it will resume service due to boiler repairs.</p>

<p>upstream along the Yangtze River. The ambassador arrived in Nanjing on the 23rd, departed Nanjing at 9:00 AM on the 24th, passing Xunyang, and arrived in Hankou on the 29th. He met with the Consul General in Hankou, Mr. Davis, to hear a report on the affairs of overseas Chinese, and after meeting with the main American businessmen in the area on the 30th, he returned on the 31st on the same ship, accompanied by the American ship "Guam" for</p>
<p>protection. The ambassador and his party arrived here on the afternoon of the 5th of this month and stayed at the Cathay Hotel. However, because Chongqing was eager for him to return to his post, he, along with Mr. Hemmick, a judge of the U.S. Court for China, left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the Dutch mail ship "Cheshire" at 2:00 PM on the 8th and flew to Chongqing on a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane. As for Military Attaché Major Oley, Army Attaché Major Max, Military Attaché Meyer, and others, after arriving in Hong Kong, they will</p>
<p>change their route to Hanoi and travel to Chongqing via the Yunnan-Burma Road. During the ambassador's trip to Hankou, the Japanese deliberately made threatening statements. The American community in Shanghai believes this to be absurd because of the extremely friendly relationship between China and the United States. It was rumored that the American ship "Luzon" was hit by an explosion resembling a bomb when the ambassador was returning to Shanghai near Wuhu. The U.S. Navy Department claimed that it had</p>
<p>no official report. Even Admiral Horder, commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, which is based in the Philippines, vehemently denied this rumor on the 9th. Admiral Horder dismissed the rumor that the "Luzon" was bombed in Wuhu as unfounded. The ambassador's return to his post will involve meetings with central authorities and a reunion with British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and French Ambassador Cosme. It is said that he will stay in Chongqing for an extended period.</p>
<h3>Post Office Temporarily Suspends Acceptance of Airmail to Austria and Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1602 states: This office has suspended the acceptance of airmail to Germany, as announced in this office's Notice No. 1596 of January 5, 1940. Now, this office also temporarily suspends the acceptance of airmail to Austria and Czechoslovakia. This is hereby announced for general information.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Fundraising Dinner: To Help Finland's War Effort - Also Held a Dance Party: To Raise Funds for Disaster Relief in War Zones</h3>
<p>The Norwegian Night Banquet Association in China held a night banquet and gathering at the French Club on the evening of the 9th to donate to Finland's wartime expenses. The event was presided over by Mr. A. Algot. From 11:00 PM that evening to 2:00 AM the next morning, a dance party was held, with tickets costing five yuan each. The proceeds were used for disaster relief in war zones around Helsinki. The launch of the association was reportedly supported by Mrs. Cosme, wife of the French Ambassador.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ships Prohibited from Carrying Military Personnel of European Warring Nations: Japanese Shipping Companies Receive Instructions from Japanese Government - Germans Can Only Travel on American Ships, etc.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Japanese shipping companies in this city have received instructions from the Japanese government prohibiting them from carrying people serving in the armed forces of European warring nations, in order to avoid a recurrence of incidents similar to the "Asama Maru" affair. However, pending further detailed explanation of these instructions, Japanese shipping companies in this city, such as NYK Line, will still allow British, French, and German nationals to travel to Europe and America on Japanese ships.</p>
<p>As for Jewish refugees fleeing Germany, since they are unlikely to be conscripted, they will also be allowed to travel on Japanese ships. British, French, and German nationals wishing to travel on Japanese ships must sign a declaration stating that they are not in active service nor have they been conscripted. If the ship is intercepted by a warring nation exercising its rights under international law, the Japanese shipping company</p>
<p>will not be held responsible. Therefore, it is very difficult for British and French nationals to depart Shanghai on Japanese ships, but this is not the case for Germans. If they depart Shanghai on Japanese ships, they will receive a notification that they are assuming the risk. Germans of military service age in Shanghai can only depart on Greek, Norwegian, and American ships.</p>
<p>American shipping companies in this city have not yet received instructions prohibiting them from carrying Germans or other nationals of warring nations, so they will continue to carry passengers with passports and other proper documents as before.</p>
<h3>Declared Value Should be Clearly Stated When Reporting Re-Exported Goods</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Trade Licensing Office announced yesterday that, from now on, when merchants report re-exporting goods that were originally imported, they must clearly state the value of the goods when applying for a trade license, in order to facilitate review. This is announced.</p>

<h3>Salvation Army Relief Efforts for Two Months - Second Round of Price Controls Planned - Over 40,000 Bags of Foreign Rice Arrived This Week - Donations for Price Controls Expected to Reach Full Amount Soon</h3>
<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. This week, a total of 44,336 bags were shipped from Hong Kong: 12,512 bags arrived on the "Jinan" on the 5th, 18,695 bags arrived on the "Taiyuan" on the same day, and another 13,129 bags arrived on the "Chengdu" yesterday. Yesterday was the Lunar New Year, so the foreign rice that arrived on the "Chengdu" will not be unloaded until tomorrow (Monday).</p>
<p>Over 10,000 Bags of Relief Rice Distributed Daily</p>
<p>Since the Salvation Army began its winter relief feeding program two weeks ago, it has been distributing food twice a day, at 10:00 AM and 6:00 PM, throughout the city. The details of this program have been reported extensively and have been praised by people from all walks of life. Since the start of the program, beggars have generally been able to maintain order. Officers of the Salvation Army have selected capable beggars to direct the queues, allowing them to receive food in an orderly manner. Therefore, the amount of food distributed daily has now increased to over 10,000 bags. On Lunar New Year's Eve, the Salvation Army, feeling that these impoverished people who beg year-round have not tasted meat, specially donated a large quantity of salted meat, as is customary in Chinese tradition. It also made tens of thousands of steamed buns, packed them into over 10,000 bags, and loaded them onto three trucks at 6:30 PM, departing from Dunxin Road and passing through Avenue Edward VII, Avenue du Grand Conseil, Datong Road, Xiamen Road, north of Suzhou Creek, and the Wai Nan area to distribute food to impoverished beggars. Over a hundred people participated in the distribution, including Lieutenant-Colonel Ma Ruishan, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Baotian, and all the officers of the Salvation Army. It is reported that this feeding program will continue for two months, while the distribution of meat and steamed buns has been stopped. It may be resumed later depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Second Round of Price Controls: Date of Commencement: The first round of price controls began on January 21st, with 50 price control points set up in the two settlements. It ended on February 6th, with a total of 34,070 bags of Saigon broken rice sold. The second round of price controls is scheduled to begin on February 23rd. The locations and prices for the second round will be decided at a meeting of the Price Control Committee. However, it has already been decided to continue to entrust the member rice shops of the Shanghai Rice Industry Association with the management, and the police departments of the two settlements will continue to be responsible for maintaining order. The association's second order of 11,000 bags of broken rice from Saigon has already been shipped to Shanghai in two batches and is temporarily stored in warehouses for the second round of price controls. It has also purchased 30,000 bags of spot goods on the Shanghai market, which were finalized before the general closing. Including the forward contracts and spot goods from the first time, the association has purchased approximately 80,000 bags of broken rice for price controls in total. After selling 34,070 bags in the first round, there are still 45,930 bags remaining.</p>
<p>Fundraising Must Reach Full Amount: A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the association's secretariat yesterday that, given the rising rice prices on the Shanghai market, the association has incurred significant losses in implementing price controls. Without substantial donations, it fears that it will be difficult to sustain the effort. Therefore, it hopes that enthusiastic people will donate generously so that the price controls will not be interrupted. The original target for price control donations was one million yuan, but only over 500,000 yuan has been confirmed to have been received. Therefore, it is hoped that the full amount can be raised in the near future.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Ambushed Near Xiashi: Japanese Troops Panicked, Over 30 Killed or Wounded - Japanese Artillery Fired Indiscriminately from Both Mountains All Night Long</h3>
<p>Around 8:00 PM on the 9th of this month, Chinese guerrillas near Xiashi took advantage of the Spring Festival holiday to launch a large-scale attack. At Siguan, they used machine guns, small steel cannons, and rifles to attack the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops were unprepared and panicked. The Japanese artillery on the east and west mountains fired artillery indiscriminately, and the fighting continued until 1:30 AM, when it finally stopped. Afterwards, the Japanese and puppet troops conducted a large-scale search, and over 200 passersby were arrested. On the morning of the 10th, they forcibly conscripted over 200 farmers to reinforce the fortifications at various passes, causing widespread panic and seclusion. The market was deserted. After investigation, it was found that over 30 Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded.</p>
<h3>Relief Situation in Hangzhou: Report from Jisheng Association</h3>
<p>In Hangzhou, there are approximately 60,000 to 70,000 disaster victims relying on relief. A household survey was conducted using the Baojia system, dividing the city into three districts inside the city and three districts outside the city. The third district is the most severely affected. The local Red Swastika Society, together with enthusiastic merchants, supervised the distribution of relief rice, with each person receiving several Sheng. However, the disaster is widespread, and the funds are limited, making it impossible to provide relief to everyone. Only those deemed eligible were given relief. 9,726 people received relief in the first district, 7,774 in the second district, and 6,311 in the third district. Work is underway in the other districts. However, after hearing the news, the disaster victims outside the city anxiously awaited food. They sent representatives, along with the Jia chiefs, to beg for relief, standing in the ice and snow all day without dispersing. The situation is extremely tragic. However, the funds entrusted by various charities in Shanghai amount to less than 50,000 yuan. Rice in Hangzhou costs around 40 yuan per Shi, making it difficult to provide widespread relief. It is reported that the number of people dying from cold and hunger is increasing daily, and they cannot survive without continued spring relief.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Workers' Living Conditions in 1939</h3>
<p>Wage Rates and Actual Income of Various Workers: After the outbreak of the war, the wage rates and actual income of male and female piece-rate workers in various industries were low, especially for male workers. This year, the wages of various workers in all industries have increased. However, the wage rates and actual income of male workers are still lower than those of the pre-war year of 1936. The following table compares the wage rates and actual income of various workers this year with those of the previous year and 1936, showing the trend of increase and decrease:</p>
<p>Working Hours: This year, the average daily working hours in various industries were the longest in the silk reeling industry, followed by cotton spinning, flour milling, and cotton weaving. The above industries were generally very busy this year, often extending working hours and increasing output. Due to slightly weaker business, tobacco factories averaged only seven hours of work per day. For all industries combined, the average was 10.92 hours, slightly lower than the previous year. However, the number of working days per month this year was slightly higher than the previous year, averaging 23.78 days, compared to 22.48 days in 1938 and 23.66 days in 1936. Generally speaking, all industries were busy this year. The paper industry had the most working days per month, averaging 28.59 days, followed by oil pressing at 27.81 days, and then flour milling at 27.22 days. Work in the match industry was intermittent, with weather changes and raw material supply having an impact. In the second half of this year, the silk reeling industry was most affected by the inability to transport autumn cocoons to Shanghai, and most factories had to shut down, reducing the number of working days.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Rise Uncontrollably: Over a Hundred Boiled Water Shops Close Down - Association Earnestly Urges Compliance with Association Rules</h3>
<p>Over 500 boiled water shops in this city have been unable to resolve the issue of coal supply and high prices, despite the Shanghai Boiled Water Industry Association's repeated efforts to dredge coal supplies and appeal for assistance to lower coal prices. Coal prices continue to soar, with the highest price breaking a new record of 200 yuan per ton. Boiled water shops with less capital have been unable to maintain operations due to the high expenses and have temporarily closed down one after another. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency visited various districts in the British and French Concessions yesterday and saw notices posted at the entrances of the closed boiled water shops stating, "This shop is affected by the soaring coal prices, resulting in significant losses. It is forced to temporarily suspend operations. This shop will suspend water sales from now on. It will resume operations as soon as coal prices drop." It is understood that the total number of closed shops has reached over a hundred, mainly due to the impact of expensive coal prices. Shops that are still selling water as usual will sell water at the prices stipulated by the association. Representatives of the industry association are now earnestly urging compliance with association rules, waiting for a solution, and not raising prices without reason to avoid affecting the livelihood of the common people and maintaining security within the settlements. The Boiled Water Industry Association is actively seeking solutions and continuing to appeal for assistance from all sectors to maintain the entire boiled water industry.</p>
<h3>Liu Haisu Sells Paintings Overseas: 100,000 Yuan Donated for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>A letter from the Java Charity Painting Exhibition Association yesterday stated that the famous painter Liu Haisu recently traveled south, bringing with him hundreds of modern masterpieces. The China Modern Painting Exhibition Charity Fundraising Conference, organized by the Charity Painting Exhibition Association and held at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, was an unprecedented success on its opening day. The overseas Chinese community and local political, business, and diplomatic circles warmly supported it. 150 paintings were sold in three days, earning 13,000 guilders, equivalent to over 100,000 legal currency, all of which were donated for disaster relief. It is expected that the number will exceed this before the closing.</p>
<h3>Refugee Area in Nanshi Continues to Operate as Usual</h3>
<p>After the opening of Nanshi, there were rumors that the refugee area would be designated as a commercial area by the Japanese puppet regime and that all refugee shelters would be taken over and relocated to Caohejing in western Shanghai. Gu Lun, director of the Refugee Area Supervisory Committee, stated that he had heard of these rumors beforehand. Father Jacquinot, the founder of the refugee area, had no comment. There are still 91 refugee shelters in the refugee area, housing over 20,000 refugees, all of whom are homeless and destitute. All supplies are being maintained as usual, and there are no problems. As for the rumors of being taken over, no one has approached us to discuss this as of recently.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Spring Holiday: Four Days - Resumed Actual Work Yesterday - Certificate Applications for Cotton Cloth Factories: Approximately 4,000 Items Still Outstanding</h3>
<p>All industries require a certificate list to be released to transport goods to the inland areas. This list includes cotton cloth for the most part. Because the method for obtaining certificates was required to be changed during the Lunar New Year, the dyeing and weaving factories were coming to hurry up to receive their list, so those coming could not be given in time. In particular, the Xin Xin Zhen, Lun Hua, and Hua Feng factories accounted for the largest number. The association worked day and night, even on Sundays. There were still nearly 4,000 items outstanding until the Lunar New Year's Eve. Therefore, although there was a four-day spring holiday from February 8th to 11th, the internal work actually started on the 10th, limited to clearing and expediting the outstanding items. However, no documents were accepted from the outside.</p>
<h3>Norwegian Government Donates: Pure Cod Liver Oil Arrives in Shanghai - Total Amount is 6,000 Pounds - Reportedly the Second Time</h3>
<p>The orphans in this city received 6,000 pounds of Norwegian pure cod liver oil donated by the Norwegian government on the 3rd of this month. It is learned that the donation was forwarded by the Norwegian Consulate in this city. This is the second time the cod liver oil has been donated. The first time was as far back as 1937. It is designated for refugee children or those suffering from lung diseases. The Norwegian authorities have a large quantity of pure cod liver oil to donate to suffering children in Finland.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Orchestra Concert</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Orchestra will hold the eighteenth concert of the season at the Lyceum Theatre on February 11th (Sunday) at 5:15 PM. There are three items on the program. Ticket prices remain the same.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Wharf Drug Case: Perpetrators Sentenced - Eight Suspects Released</h3>
<p>On the evening of December 28th of last year, at 11:00 PM, the Louza Police Station of the French Concession cracked a major drug case at Wharf No. 5 on Roosevelt Road. At that time, 160 kilograms of opium, totaling 2,460 taels, were confiscated. The three main culprits, Yang Tianxiang and Ma Ji from Shandong, and Li Huaian from Tianjin, were arrested and confessed that the main headquarters was located at No. 32 Baoxingli, Dongxin Bridge. The detectives immediately rushed there and arrested ten more people, including Li Shufang, Wang Jinhai, Wen Xingren, Wang Chunnian, Guo Zhiyuan, Sun Zhaozhong, Wu Zhengrong, Wu Wanxiang, Chen Yushan, and Liu Baolai. They were all sent to Criminal Division 1 of the Special No. 2 Court. The police lawyer found no connection to Li Shufang, Wen Xingren, Wang Chunnian, Guo Zhiyuan, Wu Zhengrong, Wu Wanxiang, Chen Yushan, and Liu Baolai and did not prosecute them. Judge Miao Qingbang released them in court and rescheduled the case. The trial continued yesterday morning, and the court ruled: Yang Tianxiang and Ma Ji are sentenced to two years imprisonment for helping to transport drugs. Sun Zhaozhong is sentenced to one year and six months imprisonment. Li Huaian is sentenced to six months imprisonment. Wang Jinhai is acquitted.</p>
<h3>Cost of Living Index in This City: Reached New Peak Last Month - Purchasing Power of Currency Greatly Reduced - One Legal Tender Yuan is Worth Only Slightly More Than 3 Jiao</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the year, the cost of living index reached a new peak. The total index for January was 325.44, 225.44% higher than the average index for the base period of 1936, and 114.57% higher than January of last year. It was also 7.03% higher than the highest index to date, December of last year. As a result, the purchasing power of currency decreased. In December of last year, one legal tender yuan was equivalent to 3 Jiao 2 Fen 8 Li 9 Hao of 1936, while this month it is equivalent to only 3 Jiao 0 Fen 7 Li 3 Hao. The classified indexes were all higher than last month, as excerpted below:</p>
<p>The end of the month coincides with the end of the Lunar New Year. Every year, citizens will prepare for the Lunar New Year, and prices will inevitably be high. Furthermore, in the last week of the month, the weather turned cold, with rain and snow covering the roads, having a serious impact. In addition, speculation and manipulation were also important reasons for raising general prices.</p>
<p>The average price of Japonica rice on the 2nd of this month was slightly lower than last month, but the future of rice is not optimistic. The rice market was very manipulated at the end of the month, attempting to privately exceed the limit and secretly sell first-class goods, opening a limited price of 40 yuan for first-class goods. The high prices were hoarded and speculated by manipulators, and retail rice shops often mixed second-class goods to meet the market.</p>
<p>The price of flour increased this month. At the beginning of the month, the price per bag was less than 9 yuan, but by the end of the month, it had reached more than 11 yuan. Recently, rice prices have been high, and citizens often eat pasta as well. Although Yunnanese people eat rice, the crazy rise in the flour market has had a great impact on the people's food.</p>

<h3>The Secretary of the Ham Industry Association, Cai Xiaohe, Assassinated; Three Shots Hit Vital Points; The Reason for the Murder is Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at around 12 noon, at the Ham Industry Association's premises located at 77 Race Course Road (near Longmen Road) in the Public Concession, a sudden</p>
<p>assassination bloodbath occurred. The person who was shot and died on the spot was Mr. Cai Xiaohe, the association's secretary. Cai was a native of Jinhua, Zhejiang, 46 years old, and lived alone in Shanghai without family. His residence was in the pavilion room at number 77. He was usually an active figure in society. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, someone carrying a weapon went upstairs, pushed open the door of the pavilion room, and without asking any questions, fired three consecutive shots at Cai. Cai was caught off guard and was hit once in the right chest, once in the left shoulder, and once in the right neck. He immediately fell into a pool of blood with serious injuries. The assassin, seeing that his purpose was achieved, turned around and went downstairs, fleeing through the door. Afterwards, the association's tea servant reported to the Chengdu Road police station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. At the same time, Cai Xiaohe, who was severely injured, was rushed to Baolong Hospital for emergency treatment. However, all three bullets hit Cai in</p>
<p>vital points, and he died due to excessive bleeding before he could be saved. The body was then transferred from the hospital to the coroner's office for examination. It is reported that Cai was wearing a dark blue leather robe, lined with silk cotton jacket and trousers, gray socks, and black shoes when he was attacked. He had a flat-top haircut and was not wearing a hat. The detectives only found his personal card near his body, and nothing else. As for the reason for his murder, whether it was a personal vendetta or some other political motive, the police authorities are currently conducting a detailed investigation.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Apprentice Extorting Money by Intimidation; Repeatedly Demanding Money from the Shop Owner; Finally Reported, Arrested and Detained</h3>
<p>Fan Jiashan (19 years old), a native of Chongming, had been an apprentice at the Most Fashionable Leather Shoe Store at 200 North Jiangxi Road for several years. Recently, due to his gambling habits, he was fired by the store owner, Chen Wenqing, a native of Ningbo, and became a vagrant. Between January 20th and 23rd of this year, he went to the store twice to borrow 15 yuan in legal tender from Chen, threatening to take drastic measures if refused. As a result, after persuasion, Chen gave him seven yuan to settle the matter. Unexpectedly, the apprentice Fan took the money he got to a gambling den in West Shanghai and lost it all. Yesterday, the 5th, at 11:15 PM, Fan encountered Chen Wenqing at the entrance of Lane 132, North Zhejiang Road. He drew a knife and demanded another 500 yuan, threatening Chen's life. Chen Wenqing immediately took out a police whistle from his pocket and blew it, while running and shouting "Robbery," finally escaping safely. The next day, he reported the matter to his introducer, Nie Youliang (a native of Nanjing), who at 7:30 PM, twisted Fan Jiashan over to Chinese Detective Huang Siming on Niuzhuang Road. He was taken to the Old Zha police station, then transferred to the Hui Division police station, where the case was reported to the police chief for detention. On the morning of the 7th, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a public prosecution against the apprentice Fan for extortion by intimidation. Subsequently, the owner of the Most Fashionable Leather Shoe Store, Chen Wenqing, and his introducer, Nie Youliang, testified about the incident. When questioned, the apprentice Fan stammered and denied using a knife to threaten and demand 500 yuan. Judge Liu Yugui ordered him to be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Four Strange Men in West Shanghai Kidnap a Pedestrian</h3>
<p>Near Wujiaochang in West Shanghai's Caojiadu, at around 11 PM the night before last, a pedestrian dressed in a Zhongshan suit, wearing a black wool overcoat, about thirty years old, and speaking with a Cantonese accent, was walking along the road when four strange men jumped out from the side of the road. Each of them took out a Mauser pistol and said, "We have been waiting for you for a long time. Please come with us." The pedestrian spoke a few words in Cantonese with the group, and the four strange men said, "Don't dawdle. Be sensible." After saying this, the four strange men grabbed him and went north. Arriving at the entrance of Garden Lane on Bailinan Road, they forced the pedestrian to board a car that was parked there, and drove away. According to witnesses at the time, the four strange men were wearing different clothes, but all had on uniform trousers. It is expected that the kidnapping of the pedestrian is politically motivated, and he may be arrested by some party.</p>
<h3>Shocking Robbery on Shanxi Road; Another Arms Dealer Captured; Robbers Confess to Buying Arms; Three Russians and Two Chinese Arrested; Injured Western Detective Chief Recovering</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that detectives from the Central Police Station of the Public Concession, in cooperation with the police of the French Concession, arrested three Russians and two Chinese in the French Concession on Wednesday night. It is said that the three Russians sold two Mauser pistols and 150 rounds of ammunition to the robbers who engaged in a shootout with detectives at the intersection of Shanxi Road and Beijing Road on February 1st. The two Chinese acted as</p>
<p>intermediaries in the sale of guns. These five people are now being held in the Central Police Station and the Chengdu Road Police Station and will be brought before the First Special District Court for questioning on Monday morning. Previously, the robbers who exchanged fire with the detectives were arrested and confessed that in mid-January, they bought two Mauser pistols and 150 rounds of ammunition from a Russian in the French Concession for 50 yuan. They did not remember the exact address of the Russian, but they were willing to lead the detectives there.</p>
<p>After obtaining the confession, the detectives went to a house on Ya'erbei Road at around 7 PM on Wednesday night and arrested three Russians: Huo Jueji, 57 years old, unemployed; Naqiefu, 57 years old, a mechanic; and Yalabai Xifu, 29 years old, a car salesman. The detectives then went to a house on Huanlong Road and arrested the two intermediaries, Cao Zhang and Yang Sen (both transliterations), and took them to the police station. At first, the five people categorically denied knowing the robbers or selling guns. Later, Huo Ciji confessed that he bought two guns and ammunition from Yalabai Xifu through Naqiefu's mediation. Afterwards, the guns were resold to several Chinese through the mediation of the two Chinese. He did not know who the Chinese who bought the guns were, nor did he ask their purpose for buying the guns. Naqiefu then also confessed to mediating the sale of two guns to Huo Ciji and receiving a commission. However, Yala Xi Baifu alone still categorically denied participating in the sale of guns, saying that he had nothing to do with the matter. Since being arrested on Wednesday night, Mr. Ya has refused to eat or drink. Thus, the</p>
<p>shocking robbery case has implicated more criminals. The police are continuing to interrogate them in the hope of capturing the two lookouts who fled before the incident occurred. It has been learned that the arrested robbers have committed several robberies in the Public Concession this year. (Another report) Western Deputy Detective Chief Moore of the Public Concession's Police Department was shot and injured during a fight with bandits in Zhongde Lane, Beijing Road, Shanxi Road, last Thursday. After Mr. Moore was injured, he was sent to the Public Concession Hospital for treatment. It is now known that the wound has healed and he will return to work at the Central Police Station next week. Police Chief Kak, was also hit by a bullet in this battle, but has also recovered, but still needs recuperation. Two robbers died and nine were captured in this battle. One of the robbers was only 15 years old. He was blinded by tear gas smoke and surrendered.</p>
<h3>Stabbing Incident; Wang Wenqing Seriously Wounded</h3>
<p>Wang Wenqing, 36 years old, lives at 126 Wujiaochang, Caojiadu, West Shanghai. Yesterday at 1:30 PM, while passing near Xiaohuayuan on Sanmalu Road, he suddenly encountered Cao Donglai, whom he knew. However, without asking any questions, Cao drew a knife and stabbed Wang Wenqing four times, once in the back, once in the head, and once in the left shoulder. The wounds were very deep, and he collapsed in a pool of blood with serious injuries. When Chinese police officer No. 306 arrived after hearing the alarm, he arrested the murderer on the spot and took him to the police station. At the same time, he called an ambulance to send the injured to Renji Hospital for treatment. His life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Trolleybus Drives into Store; One Elderly and One Young Person Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 0:20 noon, a No. 17 trolleybus returning from the Great World to Dapuqiao was traveling along Kangti Road when a group of children were playing in the middle of the road in front of the Fuxingxiang signboard shop at number 380. The driver tried to steer the bus to avoid them, but inadvertently drove the bus onto the sidewalk and into the Fuxingxiang store. In addition to damaging the walls and decorations, it also injured one old man and one child whose names are unknown. After the police were informed, they immediately dispatched an ambulance to take the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Employees dispatched by the French Electric Company removed the offending vehicle, causing traffic on the road to be cut off for more than twenty minutes.</p>
<h3>Great Joy Toothpaste's Sales on New Year's Eve are Astounding; Most Retail Stores Sold Out; Everyone is Happy and Wants Good Luck</h3>
<p>The Great Joy toothpaste produced by the Yecheng Industrial Society, because it contains a special spearmint scent, is of high quality, easily whitens teeth, eliminates bad breath, and is especially effective for yellow and stained teeth.

All inventory was sold out, and those who came later were politely turned away, showing the astonishing sales of Great Joy toothpaste. Since the company promoted Great Joy toothpaste as a celebratory gift, people in Shanghai with foresight have been promoting it, and upper-class families have adopted it as well, because it is the most generous and auspicious gift, making friends and relatives cheer and satisfying every guest. The company has samples available. To request a sample or inquire about details, please call 91503. The company will send a female employee to your residence to discuss business.</p>

<h3>Bomb Explodes in the Machine Room of the British Evening Post; One Worker Injured</h3>
<p>The Continental Post reported that yesterday (9th) at around 4 PM, a bomb exploded in the printing house of the British Evening Post at 181 Aiduya Road, owned by a British merchant. It appeared that the explosion was caused by a timed bomb. One Chinese worker was injured, and part of the printing house's equipment was damaged. The injured worker's legs were broken and he was rushed to the hospital. It is said that his injuries are very serious. The police of the French Concession are investigating this atrocity.</p>

He was wearing a black cotton jacket and trousers, gray socks, and black velvet-soled shoes. He appeared to be a merchant. The nose was severely injured and covered in blood. The cause of death is unknown. According to residents in the area, the corpse was probably killed by robbers.</p>
<h3>North Goods Company Staff Embezzles in Collusion with Apprentices; Forged Invoices Embezzle More Than Ten Thousand Yuan; Mastermind Flees to Ningbo, Two Apprentices Arrested</h3>
<p>Zheng Shangen, a native of Ningbo, around 30 years old, worked at Zai Xin North Goods Company at A-52 Yanghang Street in the French Concession. With the support of his cousin, shareholder and manager Zheng Hegeng, he was promoted to accountant and given the power to manage money. Recently, he became involved in gambling dens, incurring huge debts. At the end of the Lunar Year, unable to make up for the losses, he colluded with his colleagues Zhang Minghong (29 years old, from Jiading) and apprentice Shen Wenkui (also known as Pin Hai, 19 years old, from Ningbo) to privately engrave a seal,</p>
<p>forge invoices, and collect payments from customers. After slightly splitting the profits, the rest was used to pay off debts. Furthermore, fearing that customers would reconcile accounts during the Lunar New Year and that they would not be able to escape detection, he entrusted Shen Wenkui to deposit 10,000 yuan in cash into the Four Banks Savings Society on the 2nd of this month, using the pseudonym Wang Hengjiu. On the 3rd, he took a boat to Ningbo. Manager Zheng Hegeng discovered that 5,700 yuan was missing from the invoices and 1,700 yuan was missing in cash. On the Lunar New Year's Eve, it was also discovered that</p>
<p>customer payments had been collected, and it was observed that Zhang and Shen had sent Zheng Shangen off on the boat and that their attitude was unusual. Knowing that there was collusion, he reported it to the French police, who arrested Zhang Minghong and Shen Wenkui. The next day (Lunar New Year's Eve), they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. After police lawyer Yuan Jiahuan explained the case, he requested a postponement for further investigation before interrogation. The plaintiff Zheng Hegeng also stated that it was now determined that about 11,000 yuan had been embezzled, and that the remaining amount would only be clear after settling accounts tonight.</p>
<p>When questioned, Zhang Minghong confessed that Zheng Shangen gave me 200 yuan and also repaid 500 yuan of my debts to the company. Shen Wenkui confessed that he used 200 yuan and deposited 10,000 yuan into the Four Banks Savings Society for Zheng Shangen. After reviewing the confession, Judge Peng Xian ordered that the case be adjourned to the 16th for further questioning. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Case of Murdering Father An; Revokes Closure of Arguments; Further Detailed Investigation Required Before Final Verdict</h3>
<p>Father An, a Frenchman who was the head of the orphanage and workshop of the Catholic Church in Tushanwan, Xujiahui, West Shanghai, was robbed and strangled to death on August 30th of last year. After the case occurred, the French police dispatched detectives to investigate the murderers. Later, a Catholic robber named Ju Bolu surrendered himself to the police. Then, four accomplices and suspects were captured, including Jiang Yunqing, Lu Gendi, Shen Xingtang, and Wang Guirong. However, the main criminal, Zhou Yuelou, fled to the guerrilla area.</p>
<p>Ju and the five criminals were sent to the Second Special District Court. After investigation, they were publicly prosecuted for robbery and murder. Because the location of the incident belonged to the Chinese territory, the court submitted a request to the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court to designate the Second Special District Court to manage and try the case with regard to jurisdiction. Liao, the head of the Criminal Court in charge of the case, believing that the case was important, was not afraid to seek details. He held a hearing more than ten times and appointed Wang Hengyi, Yu Zhaolin, and Tao Ran as defense lawyers for the defendants. Originally, he had announced the closure of the trial and scheduled the sentence to be announced on the 7th of this month. All the details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Judge Liao, in order to be</p>
<p>cautious, still had several points regarding the evidence in the case that needed to be investigated in detail before a final verdict could be made in order to be convincing. Therefore, on the 7th, the date of the sentencing at 2 PM, he ordered the defendants to be brought to the court and announced the revocation of the closure of the arguments. He scheduled a retrial and reopening of the arguments on the 22nd. The defendants were transferred to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Chinese Detective Chief of Five Continents Detective Agency Sentenced for Fraud; Three Pairs of Handcuffs Confiscated</h3>
<p>Qiu Haitao, the Chinese detective chief of the Five Continents Detective Agency, led detectives Gao Wenbing and others, along with Western detective Ma Ying, to 408 Julida Road on December 23rd of last year at 9 AM, using the pretext of searching for contraband to extort 600 yuan in national currency from Du Shaoru, a wealthy merchant from Chongming. Du's daughter reported the matter to the French police, who arrested them. Apart from Ma Ying, who was handed over to the French Consulate for questioning, the other criminals were all sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang announced the sentence: Qiu Haitao, Wang Qiwen, and Gao Wenbing were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for using intimidation to cause others to hand over their property. Xu Yongchang was sentenced to nine months of imprisonment for illegally entering another person's residence. The other parts were acquitted. Three pairs of handcuffs were confiscated.</p>

<h3>Interport Football Match; Shanghai Defeats Hong Kong; One Goal in Each Half; Hong Kong Team Loses Due to Weak Forwards</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hong Kong interport football match, which had been suspended for two years due to the war, was finally resumed this year after much effort. The Shanghai and Hong Kong teams met at Yiyuan on the afternoon of the Lunar New Year. The Hong Kong team's weakness was as expected, and they suffered a 2-0 defeat. Shanghai scored one goal in each half, retaining the "Hong Kong Telegraph Cup." As it was the first day of the Lunar New Year, tickets for Yiyuan, even the most expensive seats at two yuan and two jiao, were snapped up, and the stadium was packed. The occasion was no less grand than a charity match, with an estimated attendance of over 15,000 people. The lineups for the two teams on that day were as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Team</p>
<p>Qi Lihuate</p>
<p>Hailieson Ke Laituo</p>
<p>Jiemu Huate Li Yicheng Xigelun</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting Sun Jinshun Lao Bashi Tuofu Maikelade Fu En</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team</p>
<p>Moshi Xian</p>
<p>Da Shidu</p>
<p>Lan Zhi Xia Xian</p>
<p>Hannibal Lu Da Gaoshan Nu Gan Shi</p>
<p>Xiao Shidu Lan Zhi Hua Lu He Xi Li Anna Mai Yiyun</p>
<p>Hong Kong Team Mediocre; Defense More Important Than Offense; The Hong Kong team was quite weak in strength due to the refusal of Chinese players to participate in the northbound journey, and the fact that some of the best Western players were unable to come due to official duties. Before leaving Hong Kong, they lost 3-0 to the Hong Kong Chinese League in Hong Kong. Therefore, Shanghai's victory this time was expected. The Hong Kong team itself was aware of this, so on that day, it temporarily changed its lineup, replacing Da Gaoshan Nu with Qian Zhongjian, focusing all its efforts on keeping a close watch on Lao Basituofu, and adopting a strategy of combining offense and defense. Da Shidu Lanzhi were veterans of the interport match, and together with Indian Xia Xian, the two fullbacks were indeed extraordinary. Central defender Gan Shi was also very good. Therefore, although the Shanghai team was in full offensive mode, they repeatedly failed to score, and only scored two goals because of this. However, the Hong Kong team's forwards were extremely mediocre. They lacked a central figure as leader, and right-winger Mai Yiyun was a third-tier player. The entire line was like a plate of loose sand. The only one who was most active was left-winger Xiao Shidu Lanzhi. The Shanghai team's performance was also greatly reduced. The two fullbacks and three central defenders were the best, especially Ke Laituo and Xigelun. Willy Huat was not as stable as in the trials, and Jiemu Huat even missed a penalty kick in the first half. The five forwards were completely inferior to their usual selves. The excellent connection between Fu En and Mai Kelade was not seen, and Cao Qiuting had very few chances to get the ball, so he could not show his color.</p>
<p>Lao Basituofu Opens the Scoring; Shanghai Opens the Kick-off, the Army Immediately Pressing in Front of the Hong Kong Team Gate, Xigelun in Front of the Door 20 Yards Place to Kick Any Ball, Fu En Intercepted Pass Central, Sun Jinshun Later One Step, the Hong Kong Team Counterattacks, Big Mountain Slaves Rushed to the Front Door, a Scourge out, in a Flash in Front of the Hong Kong Team Door Then Spread the Alarm, Old Story Duke Left and Right Call, Busy with Response, the Shanghai Team Fierce Attack, Finally Broke the Door and Entered, in the Eighth Minute, Kolo Toue Got the Ball and Far Sent, Fu Enli Pan Invading, to the Central Flying, Lao Basi Toue, Wore into the Old History Duke Governance and Big Report by You, a Swift Sweep into the Door, the Shanghai Team One to Zero Occupied First, the Hong Kong Team Poured All Their Efforts into Counterattack, Zenghuo Two Corner Ball Opportunities, But No Effect, the Dutch Also Came a Hard Head, Fell into the Hands of Willie Huat, Sun Jinshun Head Attack in Wood Cao Qiuting Shooting Was Pounced, All These Twenty Minutes of Storm, Until the Thirty-fifth Minute, the Hong Kong Team Kan Touch the Ball Was Punished with Twelve Yards, the Air is Tight, the Shanghai Team Long Jie Mu Huat Main Penalty, Then Kick into the Moshi Wei, Leading to Being Pounced to the Back of the Door, Since Then the Shanghai Team Has Attacked, Nothing Is Achieved, the First Half of the Shanghai Team One to Zero Occupied First,</p>

The other semi-final match between Surveying and Jardine Matheson is scheduled for today, with the winner facing the Italian Navy for the championship.</p>
<h3>Last Two Minutes See Breakthrough; China United Draws with Hong Kong; Second Interport Match Ends in a Tie; Huang Kehou's Goal Saves the Day</h3>
<p>The second act of the interport football match, a friendly between the Hong Kong team and Shanghai's China United team, was held at the Recreation Ground on the afternoon of the day after Yuandan. Despite being called "China United," it was not a united team. In fact, it was represented entirely by the top-tier regular champions, the Lidu team. It was unprecedented for an independent club to compete against an interport representative team, so the Recreation Ground was filled with fans eager to see the spectacle, with a crowd as large as the official interport match the day before, estimated to be over fifteen or sixteen thousand. The battle ended in a 1-1 draw, to the great joy of both sides, especially China United. In the first half, Dasagnu headed in a goal, but it was disallowed due to a foul, so both teams went scoreless. In the second half, Meng Yiliang committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Hong Kong took the lead, but Lidu's counter-attacks were ineffective. Until the last two minutes, Wang Kehou received a pass from Cao Qiuting and scored, resulting in a draw. The lineups for both teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai China United:</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen</p>
<p>Li Yichen, Zhang Linggen</p>
<p>Yan Shixin, Meng Yiliang, Jiang Zhaoxiang</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting, Sun Jinshun, Huang Kehou, Xu Wenkui, Zhang Mingsheng</p>
<p>Hong Kong Interport:</p>
<p>Mosham</p>
<p>Li Anna, Xia Xian</p>
<p>Hua Lu, Gan, Hanibolu</p>
<p>Sturridge, Gastelo, Fox, Dasagnu, Heshi</p>
<p>Hong Kong Changes Lineup: Seven minutes into the game, Hong Kong's goalkeeper Mosham was injured in the face, leading to significant changes in the lineup. The revised lineup was as follows: Goalkeeper Mosham, defenders Xia Xian and Hua Lu, midfielders Gastelo, Gan, and Hanibolu, forwards Li Anna, Dasagnu, Fox, Heshi, and Little Sturridge. China United kicked off, playing against the sun, which seemed disadvantageous. Furthermore, Li Yichen was injured from the previous day's strenuous match, and right-winger Zhang Mingsheng generally appeared weak, leaving Xu Wenkui isolated. Only he was seen rushing back and forth, and the right wing was completely disadvantaged. Hong Kong, on the other hand, switched from defense to offense, so Hong Kong was particularly rampant after the start of the game. China United immediately stood up to meet the challenge. Qiuting advanced along the side and passed to the center. Xu Wenkui took a shot at the goal, but it flew high and missed. China United continued to attack. A-kui passed to Sun Jinshun, but Gan cleared it. Qiuting received the ball and charged forward. Mosham rushed out to save, but Qiuting's shot hit Mosham in the face, and he was unable to continue. After being helped up and treated, the game was paused for three minutes before resuming. Hong Kong's lineup was then significantly changed.</p>
<p>Goal Disallowed: As the battle resumed, the actions of both sides became increasingly rough. Although the referee Shen Huichun repeatedly penalized them, the roughness continued, which negatively impacted the excitement of the match. Both sides exchanged attacks and defenses, resulting in a evenly matched game. Hong Kong's forwards were not as gloomy as the day before. Li Anna and Dasagnu were extremely active. China United's repeated mistakes by Zhang Mingsheng were also a pity. The stalemate continued until the fortieth minute, when a new situation developed. Jinshun passed to Qiuting, who passed to Huang Kehou. Mosham saved it, but Little Sturridge got the ball and charged forward. Zhang Linggen was unable to catch up, and the ball flew to the right corner. Dasagnu jumped up and headed the ball into the net. The Hong Kong team shook hands and celebrated, but the referee Shen Huichun ruled it invalid, as Dasagnu had committed a foul before heading the ball. It was a celebration for nothing. The first half ended with no score.</p>
<p>Penalty Kick: After the band played and the teams rested, the two armies met again. Hong Kong's attacks became even more intense. Little Sturridge made a solo advance, with Dasagnu and Li Anna attacking from the left and right. Lu Zhongen immediately responded to both sides, taking desperate measures. Lidu's ball movement was lacking, causing them to feel out of sync. Zhang Mingsheng and Xu Wenkui moved down together but were blocked by Hua Lu. Qiuting crossed, but Tie Tui missed again. Huang Kehou added a shot, but the ball flew past the gate. Hong Kong's attacks continued unabated. Meng Yiliang tried to stop Fox, but he pushed him and committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Dasagnu gently kicked the ball in, and China United conceded the first goal.</p>
<p>A Stroke of Genius: The attack and defense of both sides were mutual, and the situation became extremely tense. Li Yichen was unable to run due to his injury and was anxious. Fortunately, although Hong Kong attacked, they could not find the door to score again. China United's defeat seemed inevitable. Sun Jinshun, Xu Wenkui, and Huang Kehou tried their best to counter-attack, but they could not turn the tide. More than ten thousand fans were drooping their heads in dismay when, unexpectedly, a stroke of genius occurred. In the last two minutes, Cao Qiuting went straight down the side and crossed, and the ball landed right in front of the goal. Huang Kehou jumped up and kicked the ball into the right corner. The defeated situation was suddenly turned into a draw. Zhong Qian kicked off, but after a few passes, the final whistle blew.</p>

<h3>Industry and Commerce in 1939: Every Industry Profitable...Every Path Earns Money; Millions...Nothing Strange</h3>
<p>Spring is the beginning of the year, and the plum blossom occupies the first place among all flowers. In this accounting period, the current yarn market situation will start business as usual from tomorrow. Judging from the recent foreign exchange situation, people's hearts are very good, and the market should have an advancing trend. Upon investigation, industry and commerce last year were all profitable. The net profit of the cotton industry alone was unexpectedly abundant. Profits of millions of yuan and bonuses of dozens of months are not uncommon. According to the market, last year was the first year of the prosperity and development of speculative business. The most profitable were (1) the operation of foreign exchange cash, (2) metal materials, rayon, natural silk cotton, (3) cotton yarn, (4) cotton cloth, (5) flour industry, (6) oil, beans, grains, and (7) rice industry. The order listed above is not entirely the order of profit thickness, but for the convenience of accounting. Roughly speaking, last year, as long as you bought goods once, you could earn money once. Therefore, anyone who hoarded goods, regardless of the thickness of the profit, a small hoard earned a small amount, and a large hoard earned a lot, and there was no one who did not "earn money all the way and benefit in every industry." Therefore, the hoarding trend became more intense at the end of the year, and stocking up over the year (not storing cash) has almost become a creed. The surplus of flour mills is also very considerable. One factory has more than 10 million yuan, and the price of flour has risen to 13 yuan. Some people say that everyone makes money, where does this money come from? This requires readers to go to the next translation.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Market During the Holiday Period: Rumors Surrounded It; Market Situation Step by Step</h3>
<p>February 5 (Monday): Foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listed prices did not change. The black market trend of British and American exchange rates tightened. Until the evening close, the tight price of 401625 for this year's British gold four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 28125 for American exchange rates was discovered. Fortunately, HSBC slightly came to sell, and the potential was slightly settled. The result was 40625 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 3125 for the close, tighter than last week by 09375 and 15625. The early tension was due to the eagerness of importers to settle payments, and the strong appetite of foreign firms such as China-Belgium Beneficial.</p>
<p>6th (Tuesday): Foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listed prices did not rise or fall. The black market of British and American exchange rates continued to report tightness. Once again, the tightest price this year was seen. From the beginning, it was accepted by Hong Kong speculators entrusting Chinese firms to rush in, causing it to soften to 375 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 25 shortly. Later, Sassoon vigorously sold in the near future, and foreign firms Yuntong and a small number of speculators also sold, so at this time it had rebounded to 421875 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 34375. Later, because there was a rumor from the electrical transmission that the "New Central" bank was preparing and issuing banknotes, speculators started to move around, and Sassoon also came to repurchase futures in the afternoon, so it was once again tight to 359375 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 21875. Later, because China-Belgium and the American Bank were willing to supply during the expensive period, it rebounded slightly until the noon close, and remained at 390625 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 28125. As a result, it was tighter than the previous day by 015625 and 03125.</p>
<p>7th (Wednesday): Foreign exchange market situation, the central and HSBC listed prices did not change. The black market of British and American exchange rates only had half a day of trading. The potential trend slightly stabilized, but the morning was slightly softer, and it was tight to 375 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 25. Later, because Chinese merchants came out with profits, it grew to 40625 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 2503125. However, HSBC had a very strong appetite, absorbing a lot, and at this time there was a sudden rumor that Europe had peace, so people's hearts turned, and retail investors stopped selling. Furthermore, the demand from Japanese yarn mills was very strong, so the initial looseness completely disappeared by the end of the day. The result remained at 390625 for the four-ban Shi and 7 yuan 28125 for the close. It did not distinguish between honor and disgrace compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Rises Before the Holiday; Top Plate Reaches 4,395 Yuan; Qian Rises by a Huge 160 Yuan; Silver and Money Industry Approved to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Now that it is the winter vacation, this newspaper will be suspended for six days. During this vacation period, the cash and foreign exchange black markets still have two and a half days of business. Now I will supplement the general situation later.</p>
<p>March 5 (Monday) Cash roasting red black market situation The potential is firm and firm, especially in the afternoon, it is even stronger, breaking the high price of 4,300 yuan on February 1 this year, and setting a record of 4,335 yuan. The result of the evening closing was 4,340 yuan, up 110 yuan from the end of last week. As for the occurrence of buying, it is due to the following factors: the tightening of foreign exchange, the need for guest help is very good, and I heard that some local speculators have transferred to buy gold after profiting from the multi-headed stocks of the Public Industry Association, and the gold of silver building jewelry has also risen by 10 yuan, which is 440 yuan. (Tuesday) The black market continued to prosper, and once again the highest peak of the year appeared. Chen opened and jumped 40 yuan, which was 4,380 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange suddenly turned back, people's hearts turned, and a large number of retail investors closed, it suddenly fell to a low of 4,315 yuan. As a result, the foreign exchange recovered and softened, and the saying of Jialido was very popular, and the trade wind re-emerged, and the brokerage help absorbed a lot. By the afternoon, the top plate once reached 4,395 yuan. After entering, the floating profits were sold, and it fell back to 35 yuan, which was 4,360 yuan for the close. As a result, it still rose by 20 yuan. The gold of silver building jewelry had been raised by 5 yuan, and then it returned to a small amount, which was still 440 yuan.</p>
<p>(Wednesday) The gold market opened flat, still at 4,360 yuan. Then, due to the loosening of foreign exchange, it caused a selling trend, and it had dropped to a low of 4,315 yuan. Then, the foreign exchange market tightened again, and the rumors in the market were very strong. In addition, the Hong Kong gang moved and the floating air was forced to make up for it, so it was as high as 4,390 yuan in the afternoon. As a result, it still rose by 30 yuan. The gold of silver building jewelry was also raised by 5 yuan, which was 445 yuan.</p>
<p>The silver and money industries in this city will have a three-day holiday from the 8th to the 10th for the Spring Festival and the closing period. Today is a weekly holiday, and business will resume as usual tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice Arrives Vigorously</h3>
<p>During the suspension of this newspaper, a large amount of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company Jinan ship imported on the 5th, with 12,512 bags from Hong Kong. The Taiyuan ship, which arrived in Shanghai on the same day, also loaded 18,695 bags, which have been unloaded separately. Yesterday (the 10th), the company's Chengdu ship also transported 13,129 bags from Hong Kong. Because it was the Lunar New Year, the dock workers were on holiday, so after arriving in Shanghai, it berthed at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession, and waited until tomorrow (Monday) to start unloading.</p>
<p>On the 5th, 1,390 bags of sugar were imported from Haikou, and 328 pieces of tea were imported from Hong Kong. On the 10th, 200 bags of sugar were transported from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>On the 8th, 616 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, and on the same day, 145 pieces of cloth were shipped to Hong Kong, 28 pieces to Xiamen, 36 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 16 pieces to Haikou, and 40 pieces to Haiphong. Also, 20 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Haikou, 305 pieces to Hong Kong, and 1 piece to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>A Snapshot of Last Year's Yarn Market</h3>
<p>The change in the market price of cotton yarn Twenty-count Double Horse price was 405 yuan during the red market. It then fell to 365 yuan due to the abandonment of Nanchang. When the foreign exchange fell sharply in the middle of the 5th and 6th, from eight-ban Shi to six-ban Shi and five-ban Shi, after intense manipulation by speculators, it once reached a low of three-ban Shi and 25. At this time, the people of this port were panicked, and the cotton yarn rose sharply, jumping step by step to 860 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the market price soared, the demand decreased, the war clouds in Nanning were full, the transportation and sales were hindered. At the same time, our country's agricultural products were ripe, the export of local goods was strong, the lining was loosened, the exchange rate hardened, and the long position was released until mid-October. Twenty-count Double Horse fell straight from 860 yuan to 610 yuan. Later, in mid-December, due to the impact of the European war on the US and Indian cotton markets, consumption increased, and the market price was high. In addition, the speculation of bill shrinkage revived. At the end of the year, it was seen again at 775 yuan, and the closing price was 760 yuan. As a result, it was nearly 50% higher than in 1938. Tomorrow is the God of Wealth Day in 1940. The industry will open, and I wish the cotton industry to be even better this year.</p>

<h3>The Growth of the Chinese Air Force</h3>
<p>— Hui Zi</p>
<p>Strong and healthy flying generals are the guardians of the country.</p>
<p>Two and a half years ago, when Japan began to invade China, China had only one aviation school, the Aviation Officers' School in Jianqiao, Hangzhou. But now, branch schools are being established everywhere to train flight students. Training is divided into three steps: preliminary, intermediate, and advanced. Bomber and fighter flight techniques are also being trained separately in various places. These are the fundamental training of the air force outside of the ranks.</p>
<p>Flying Lessons: In some corners of Sichuan, residents often wake up from their sweet dreams to the sound of airplanes soaring in the sky. The pilots are all tall, strong, and vigorous, aged between eighteen and twenty-two. For the first few hours, they need an instructor to accompany them on the flight, but after ten hours of training with an instructor, they can fly independently in the sky. In addition to flying skills, they also need to learn climbing, dodging attacks, and other combat-useful techniques.</p>
<p>After six months of training, a clever student completes his preliminary training. Six months later, the second stage of training also ends. Then, in the first stage of completed training, they are divided into bomber and fighter pilots. In short, it takes at least eighteen months to complete an aviation officer's training.</p>
<p>Due to the high standards in physical strength and intelligence, the number of those admitted accounts for only two or three percent of the number of applicants (the majority of physical failures are due to unqualified eyesight), and among those admitted, only sixty out of a hundred will graduate, while the rest are eliminated in various tests.</p>
<p>Patriotic Zeal</p>
<p>Those who are not admitted or are eliminated often cry before leaving, because they have lost the opportunity to serve their country. As for the young people who are admitted, they are all very good pilots. They can cope calmly when encountering difficulties, because the flame of patriotism burns in their hearts. When the first phase of training ends and they are about to enter the advanced training, they often choose fighter flight between bomber and fighter flight. Although the teachers explained that bombing is more useful in air combat, they still want to learn fighter flight, because they are willing to compete with foreign aircraft that bomb Chinese civilians. As for the aircraft, they all cherish them very much, so the damage rate of the aircraft is very, very small.</p>
<p>Learning Costs: The cost of flying courses is staggering. The Chinese government spends about 5,000 to 6,000 yuan on a flight student in his preliminary training, about 15,000 to 25,000 yuan in the second stage of training, and a huge amount of 35,000 to 45,000 yuan in the third stage of completed training. So, every graduating flight student, in addition to his priceless life, has to spend such a huge amount of money to complete him.</p>
<p>Standing, Their Life: Whether in the classroom or on the flying field, the discipline is very strict, but it is not boring, because they often hum some marching or other tunes. The food is very sufficient and beautiful, but they always stand to eat, because they have jointly made an oath that before the invaders are driven out of the Yellow Sea, there will be no chairs and stools in their dining hall.</p>
<h3>Inauguration of the Fourteenth Dalai Lama</h3>
<p>— Chrysanthemum</p>
<p>According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 6th of this month, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama has already been inaugurated. (See the report from the Shanghai Western newspaper on the 7th that the National Government remitted 400,000 yuan for the ceremony.)</p>
<p>According to Tibetan legend, the Dalai Lama is immortal. What is called death is merely a transformation of the physical body. Therefore, a child born after the passing of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama on December 17, 1933, must be his reincarnation. After searching for many days, he was found in Jiangtuya, Qinghai, in October 1937. This child, now six years old, named Lhamo Dhondup, is the newly inaugurated Fourteenth Dalai Lama. When he first met the Living Buddha (Hutuktu) who came to find him, he reached out his small hand for prayer beads. It turned out that the Thirteenth Dalai Lama had given a set of prayer beads to the Living Buddha before his death, which was strong evidence of reincarnation. He is the third son of a wealthy farmer with a total of four siblings. His family life is Sinicized, so this child can speak some Chinese, though not much. He is healthy and has piercing eyes. General Ma Bufang of Qinghai, since the Dalai Lama's reincarnation was found in his territory, sent people to protect him and advocated for raising him in Qinghai. Later, when Lhasa announced that another reincarnation had been found near it, General Ma agreed to send him to the Lhasa Monastery. This journey began on July 13th last year, with the travel expenses borne by the National Government, totaling 100,000 yuan. The journey took eight weeks.</p>
<p>Since there were three candidates for the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, according to precedent, lots should be drawn to decide. The lottery ceremony is quite solemn. In addition to the chanting of mantras and burning of incense by the monks, slips of paper are used with the names of the candidates written in Tibetan and Chinese, rolled into shapes similar to cigarettes, and placed in a golden urn. The representative sent by the National Government (currently Wu Zhongxin) then uses chopsticks to pick one out, and that person is the chosen one. This time, however, this procedure was not followed, because the Dalai Lama born in Qinghai had already been confirmed as the reincarnation of the Thirteenth, just as the Eighth Dalai Lama was able to recount stories of his previous life, so there was no need to draw lots.</p>
<p>Regarding the golden urn for drawing lots, it is worth mentioning that it was established by Emperor Qianlong in 1792. Before this, disputes often arose over the succession of the Dalai Lama. Since the installation of the golden urn, lots have been drawn to decide. There are two golden urns, one placed in Lhasa and one in the Lama Temple in Beijing, in case something happens in Lhasa, this ceremony can be held in Beijing. With the exception of the Eighth and now the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, all others have been selected using this method.</p>

<h3>A Study of the Yao Ethnic Group in Guangdong and Guangxi</h3>
<p>— Xu Songshi</p>
<p>The Yao are also written as 猺. The character 猺 began to be used in the Tang Dynasty and contains a derogatory meaning. Now that all ethnic groups are united in the republic, it should be changed to 徭.</p>
<p>Distribution of the Yao Population Currently, the Yao people in Guangdong are mostly in the Beijiang River basin and Qinzhou. In Guangxi, they are mainly in the Liujiang River basin. The Dayaoshan Mountains, where the counties of Xiuren, Xiang, Wuxuan, Guiping, Pingnan, and Mengshan in Guangxi meet, are particularly dense with Yao people. Currently, there are more than 50,000 Yao people who have not yet been assimilated in Guangdong and about 200,000 in Guangxi. The population in the Dayaoshan Mountains alone exceeds 40,000.</p>
<p>There are more than 20 types of Yao, including Hou Yao, Jinxiu Yao, Hong Yao, Ao Yao, Gou Tou Yao, Man Yao, Lan Dian Yao, Guang Tou Yao, Ma Tou Yao, Bai Ku Yao, San Hua Yao, Bang Yao, Jian Tou Yao, Dong Long Yao, Pan Yao, Liang Yao, Ban Yao, Guo Shan Yao, She Yao, and Bai Yi Shanzi. In Guangdong, almost all are Ban Yao, Pan Yao, and She Yao. In Guangxi, Ban Yao and Pan Yao are also the most common.</p>
<p>The author grew up in Lingnan and has traveled and investigated the Yao Mountains in West Guangdong many times. As far as I know, most of the Yao people in Guangxi came from Guangdong. They often claim to be from Zhuji Lane in Guangdong. Zhuji Lane is originally in Nanxiong. Many wealthy families in Lingnan often cite Zhuji Lane as their origin. Whether the Yao people's claim is reliable, I dare not say.</p>
<p>Origins of the Yao People in Guangdong and Guangxi As for the origins of the Yao people in Guangdong, opinions vary. Some say that the Yao people were originally the earliest indigenous people of Guangdong, and were forced to gradually move into Guangxi, resulting in more Yao people in Guangxi today than in Guangdong. Others say that the origins of the Yao people in Guangdong are untraceable, but they were not the earliest indigenous people of Guangdong. According to Hao's Guangdong Tongzhi in the early Qing Dynasty, there were 106 Yao Mountains in Qingyuan County, 35 Yao Mountains in Conghua County, 4 Yao Mountains in Qujiang County, 2 Yao Mountains in Yingde County, 9 Yao Mountains in Gaozhou, 58 Yao Mountains in Sihui County, 54 Yao Mountains in Xinxing County, 94 Yao Mountains in Yangchun County, 13 Yao Mountains in Yangjiang County, 7 Yao Mountains in Enping County, 49 Yao Mountains in Deqing Prefecture, 2 Yao Mountains in Fengchuan County, 33 Yao Mountains in Kaijian County, 44 Yao Mountains in Maoming County, 21 Yao Mountains in Dianbai County, 83 Yao Mountains in Xinyi County, 51 Yao Mountains in Huazhou, 26 Yao Mountains in Lingshan County, 22 Yao Mountains in Dong'an County (now Yunfu), 28 Yao Mountains in Xining County (now Yunan), and 5 Yao Mountains in Lianshan County. At the same time, the Huang Qing Zhigong Tu also stated that Xining, Lechang, Zengcheng, Ruyuan, Hepu, and other counties all had Yao people. In the early Qing Dynasty, the Yao people in Guangdong were still so numerous, so it is not surprising that many people say that the Yao people were the earliest indigenous people of Guangdong.</p>
<p>However, according to the author's research, this is not the case. According to historical records, the Yao rebellions in Lingnan first appeared during the reign of Emperor Renzong of the Song Dynasty. The Song History Renzong Ji states that in the second year of Emperor Renzong's Jingyou reign, the Yao Liao attacked Leihua Prefecture. The Song History Yang Tian Zhuan also states that in the third year of Emperor Renzong's Qingli reign, the Yao people of Hunan robbed and plundered prefectures and counties. When the rebels heard that Tian had arrived, they fled south of the mountains. From then on, the Yao rebellions in Guangdong became increasingly frequent. It can be seen that the history of the Yao people in Guangdong is still relatively shallow. Moreover, based on the author's research of more than ten years, it has already been determined that the earliest indigenous people of Guangdong and Guangxi were not Yao people, but Zhuang people.</p>
<p>Ancient Yao People's Residence The author dares to say that except for the She Yao in Chaozhou and Xunzhou, the Yao people in other parts of Guangdong and Guangxi all came from Jiangxi and Hunan. And the most ancient Yao people's residence was still in Zhejiang and Fujian provinces. We can say that Zhejiang and Fujian provinces were originally the hometown of the Yao people. The Shan Yue of the Wu and Yue states were the Yao people. The Yao people like to use the words "Pan Gu" for place names. To this day, place names with "Pan Gu" can be found continuously from Jiangsu through Jiangxi and Hunan to Guangdong and Guangxi. Luo Changyuan of the Song Dynasty said that there was a Pan Gu Temple in Huai'an, Guang, and Yangzhou had a Pan Gu Tomb and Pan Gu Shrine, Huichang in Jiangxi had a Pan Gu Post, and both had a Pan Gu Shrine, and Xiangxiang in Hunan had Pan Gu Bao. According to the author, other places such as Hengyang and Changning in Hunan, and Xunwu in Jiangxi, also have place names with "Pan Gu". The number of Pan Gu place names in Guangdong and Guangxi is even more difficult to list. The Pan Gu place names in Guangdong and Guangxi were all established by the Yao people, and only the Yao people worship Pan Gu. The Yao people's ancestors came from East China, which is clearly verifiable. Isn't this a very interesting thing? The author's recent book, "History of the People in the Yuejiang River Basin" (published by Zhonghua Book Company), also has a very detailed study of the Yao compatriots in Guangdong and Guangxi. This is just a glimpse of it.</p>

<h3>The Scavengers</h3>
<p>— Ling Yu</p>
<p>Digging for Treasures in the Garbage Daily Income of Only One or Two Dimes</p>
<p>Clearing out the overnight garbage, they are dumped bucket by bucket into the trash cans, and the scavengers—begin to be active early in the morning.</p>
<p>What are they looking for? Broken pieces of glass, and foreign bottles, filthy broken paper, cigarette butts less than five cents long, broken tin cans without lids, shoes with the faces and soles about to separate, cinders of coal balls, tin foil for wrapping cigarettes, already flattened cigarette cans, a small piece or a long strip of broken cloth or old cotton, and all kinds of broken things...they want everything.</p>
<p>Some places have purely old garbage shops that specialize in buying these things. It is said that a can full of cigarette butts can be bought for two cents, ten pieces of tin foil for wrapping cigarettes can be bought for one cent, broken paper is two cents per catty, broken cloth is three cents per catty, broken copper and scrap iron are more expensive, but rarely seen, broken shoes are one cent each, because they can be matched there. Old foreign nails can be bought for eight cents a catty. For people who live by scavenging, these shops are their outlet.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they also have exceptional harvests, finding a two-dime corner ticket in a broken wallet, picking up an ear digger next to the trash can, finding a cigarette holder in a cigarette can, and everything else that becomes an item. The selling price of this kind of thing is of course several times higher than broken things. This is an exceptional harvest, but only a kind of accidental luck.</p>
<p>Most of the scavengers are ragged, haggard, with withered faces mixed with smoke, although they can earn one or two dimes a day, but the lives of this group of people are simply the same as beggars.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Beginning Learning with Care</h3>
<p>— Yang Chunyang</p>
<p>The winter vacation has slipped away in the blink of an eye, and a new semester has already begun. Children, after spending two weeks living at home, are now carrying their schoolbags and skipping and hopping to school.</p>
<p>What work did you do during the winter vacation? I think much of it was likely squandered away easily. At that time, you were thinking: the weather is so cold, I'll wait until school starts to work hard!</p>
<p>Now the time has come for school to start. Are you working as hard as you thought you would during the vacation? Perhaps your thoughts have changed again now? Thinking that there's plenty of time ahead, today is over, there's still tomorrow, no need to work hard when school just starts, I'll wait a few more days to calm down and then start. You must know that the passing of time is the fastest thing. Today is the first day of school, but it will only be a flash, and summer vacation will be here again soon! How many promising children have been delayed in their careers by the saying "there's plenty of time ahead." Dear children! While the semester has just begun, quickly decide on your work plan! Starting from today, begin your efforts!</p>
<p>"Start with a little effort, and the result will surely be good." Children are now like the sprouting of all the plants and trees in the spring. If you hope to have good results in the future, you must rely on cultivating them well in the warm climate of spring. Without the devastation of pests and diseases, they will thrive vigorously.</p>
<p>Dear children! Now is the beginning of a semester, and also the beginning of your efforts. You must not lose this important good opportunity, work hard! I think you will surely be able to get a better harvest when the next semester ends!</p>
<h3>How to Study Science?</h3>
<p>— Shu Shan</p>
<p>Children must know: "A person's life is all about learning." Do you think that's right? The proverb says, "Learn until you are old, but you will never finish learning." "Learning is endless"...all these words are a very clear confirmation, and they are all warning us, so "learning" has a close relationship with us. But today I want to discuss with the children about science, because the modern age is a scientific age, everything needs to be scientific, then science and us have a more important connection, so we need to have a clear study of science, otherwise we will be swept into the whirlpool of elimination. Our country is also a country with backward science, so the need for science is even more urgent. But how to study science? I am not a scientist, of course I don't have any systematic and detailed methods, and I can't talk about any experience, but the following points are put forward for discussion with the children, and it can also be said that these points are necessary conditions for studying science.</p>
<p>(1) Careful observation: Science mostly emphasizes observation, because modern methods of studying science mostly use the inductive method, which is to observe the evolution of various aspects of facts to determine its final certain conclusion, but we are prone to a problem, that is, we think we are smart, and first guess its result, and then neglect careful observation.</p>
<p>(2) Patient attitude: This is a necessary condition for studying science, but we often covet simplicity and fear complexity, and everyone has a hurried mentality, that is, it is best to get a problem, and after looking at it, hope to get its result immediately, but in fact it just can't meet your ideal: then you will throw it away and not think about it anymore, this lacks a patient attitude, how can you get a correct result?</p>
<p>(3) Objective criticism: The knowledge that the teacher teaches you, on the one hand, you should sincerely accept it, but on the other hand, you should criticize which end of this knowledge is right, and why is that end wrong? Why is this end correct? Can it be suitable for all other phenomena? What incomplete shortcomings are there? Decide for yourself one by one, so that you can understand thoroughly and not blindly follow.</p>
<p>(4) Refer as much as possible, the knowledge in books is ultimately limited, and even if you can understand it very clearly, it is very few, and you should refer to other books as much as possible, and then ask teachers or parents and brothers who are more knowledgeable than you...to make a further recognition and a deeper understanding!</p>
<p>These shallow four points are offered to the children who have just started school for not many days. If you can fully meet these standards, then your knowledge will increase infinitely and your future will be great.</p>
<h3>Small Reading Plan</h3>
<p>— Tong You</p>
<p>1.  No matter how busy you are, have at least two times to read every day, that is, get up a quarter of an hour earlier in the morning, and go to bed a quarter of an hour later at night.</p>
<p>2.  Read at least half an hour a day, at least five pages, and you can read about two thousand pages in a year.</p>
<p>3.  When reading, you must concentrate, not afraid of the cold in winter, not afraid of the heat in summer, and not think about worries and happy things.</p>
<p>4.  After reading, you must think about it and firmly remember the main points of the book.</p>
<h3>Amphibious Bomb</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>We only know that bombs can only bomb things on land, and the work of destruction in the ocean has to be taken over by torpedoes. But clever scientists had long thought of relying on bombs dropped from airplanes to destroy enemy warships rampaging on the water, and now, they have finally succeeded.</p>
<p>I can't help but introduce this invention to the children, because the news published in the newspaper is too exciting. The work of German torpedoes has caused the British Navy, which dominates the sea, to suffer greatly, and cruisers and battleships have sacrificed a lot. I think the children who have read this news must can't help but praise the greatness of the torpedo, right? Yes, the torpedo is great."</p>
<p>This kind of amphibious bomb can be a bomb in space and become a torpedo when it enters the water. A large bomb contains four cylinders. If it is dropped into the water, the four cylinders storing the explosives will immediately disperse, and the compressed air originally installed inside will push them in four directions, as fast as torpedoes. When they hit the enemy ship, they will immediately explode. The most powerful thing is that if this large bomb is dropped into the water and does not hit the enemy ship, it will be divided into four torpedoes and advance fiercely in each direction. The range is very large, and it is easier to hit the target, so the danger of being attacked by the enemy is also greater. Once the United States and any country in the world go to war, they will be able to see its capabilities in this amazing invention.</p>
<h3>Two Images in the Lunar New Year</h3>
<p>— Wen Yi</p>
<p>"The New Year is here!" "The New Year is here!" Such cheers came from everywhere. The streets were more lively than before, and brilliant light shone from all directions, scattered in the noisy air. The harmonious and sweet music showed that it was issued by the people of civilized countries. Coming and going, almost half of them were children, laughing, jumping, running, playing, feeling a special pleasure, better than other fairylands. Adults also made fun of this time, and the sound of cards could be heard everywhere. The aroma of meat, chicken, and all kinds of things came from the corners of the houses. The sound of firecrackers rang continuously, and people were generally busy celebrating the New Year. But people who are forced by hunger and cold and are fiercely attacking the dark environment are crying in a low voice, for the sake of making a living, they have to run around the streets begging, thinking in their hearts: will they be able to get some food tomorrow to help them continue to maintain for one day? Their mournful faces looked up at the sky, begging heaven to give them some food. Their skin was frozen stiff, and they could no longer move. They lay down like puppets. The above two scenes, hell versus heaven, but only separated by a thin plaster wall!</p>
<h3>Pigeon Hatching Record</h3>
<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>A pair of pigeons are raised on the drying platform of Qiu'er's home. How lovely their pure white feathers are! They fly out together during the day and fly back together in the evening. In his spare time, Qiu'er cleans their houses and feeds them food, and truly loves them very much! One day, when Qiu'er was changing the rice straw for them, he suddenly found two pigeon eggs inside, which were very exquisite and lovely. Some people say: pigeon eggs can be nourishing, but Qiu'er couldn't bear to ruin these two future little lives, so he let the hen pigeon hatch the little pigeons.</p>
<p>During the incubation, the hen pigeon did not fly out, but kept the pigeon eggs close to her body morning and night: the pigeon eggs were subjected to heat for a long time, and the inside gradually changed. About two weeks later, the little pigeons came out. At first, they didn't have a single feather. After three or four days, they grew some yellow feathers and made some faint sounds, and their shape was very similar to small pigeons. The hen pigeon began to feed them; she spit out the rice grains she had eaten from her throat and fed them to her two children, always three or four times a day. She also took care of them very carefully. If you approached the little pigeons and the hen pigeon happened to be away, she would immediately run back to protect them; or if you wanted to catch the pigeons, the hen pigeon would stretch out her beak to peck you. Her care for her children is so loving and inseparable, which really makes us understand the greatness of motherhood. People and birds and beasts are originally the same!</p>
<p>The little pigeons grow up very quickly under the careful care of their mother; after ten days, the color and shape of these two chicks are no different from their parents, and soon they will be able to fly.</p>
<p>But the hen pigeon has lost a lot of weight.</p>
<h3>Black Brothers (5)</h3>
<p>— Yi Mu</p>
<p>Xi Hua muttered: "If you dare to come again, be careful!" Although he said this, he was also a little scared in his heart. He trembled and walked out of the corner; at the same time, the old gentleman had already gone out and slammed the door shut. In an instant, I saw a cloud of mist flying past the window, swirling for a while, changing into various patterns, rolling down towards the valley, and turning several times in the air before disappearing in a burst of heavy rain.</p>
<p>Xi Hua turned to Ge Le and scolded: "Humph, Mr. Ge Le, you did a good job! Quickly put the mutton on the plate. If you dare to make trouble again, I'll catch you—ah, how come this mutton has been cut!" Ge Le hurriedly said: "Brother, you once allowed me to have a piece." Xi Hua said angrily: "Okay, you cut it down while it's hot, so you can eat more gravy. You are really a clever devil! But I won't allow you to be so presumptuous anymore. Sir, leave here quickly and wait in the coal cellar. Don't come out unless you hear my call."</p>
<p>Ge Le didn't dare to disobey, and walked out listlessly. His two brothers devoured the mutton, and when their stomachs couldn't hold it anymore, they locked the rest in a bowl. Then the two of them took out wine and drank until they were drunk.</p>
<p>That night, the rain was heavy and the wind was strong, and it didn't stop. When Xi Hua and Han Shi went to bed, they first closed all the wooden boards on the windows tightly, and then fastened two iron bolts on the door before going to the bedroom. The two of them originally slept in the same room. When the clock struck twelve, the two of them were suddenly awakened by a very loud collapsing sound. The bedroom door was opened by some powerful force, which shook the whole house.</p>
<p>Xi Hua exclaimed on the bed, "What's going on?" But he heard the old gentleman coldly reply, "It's just me." The two brothers hurriedly got up and sat on the long pillow, widening their eyes and looking into the darkness, but they saw that the bedroom was flooded with water, and a blurry moonlight shot in from a hole in the window board, forming a very large water bubble, constantly rolling. Then it swayed up and down like a cork for a while before stopping, and the old gentleman was sitting on it, looking very comfortable, as if he was sitting on the softest and most luxurious chair cushion, and the pointed hat and long robe were still neatly dressed; the pointed top of the hat stood high, because the roof was gone.</p>
<p>The old gentleman said with a mocking tone: "I'm sorry to disturb you. I see that your beds are probably wet with rainwater. You should go to your younger brother's room, because I have reserved the ceiling for him."</p>
<p>The two brothers didn't dare to say anything and hurried to Ge Le's bedroom, already soaked, their hearts filled with terror. The old gentleman shouted from behind: "You two can find my business card on the kitchen table. Please remember, this is my last visit." Xi Hua trembled and said: "Please God, let it be the last time!" Then the water bubble disappeared.</p>
<p>When it dawned, the two brothers looked out from Ge Le's small window and saw that Baishi Valley had become a wasteland. All the trees, crops, cattle, and sheep had been washed away by the flood, replaced by a large pile of red sand and grayish-brown soil. The two brothers trembled as they climbed to the kitchen, only to see that the water had submerged the floor. All the money and movable things had long been swept away, and only a small piece of white paper was left on the table, with several crooked and long-bodied characters engraved on it: "Mr. Southwest Wind."</p>

<h3>Spring Festival New Film Introductions</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Tarzan Finds a Son" After watching "Tarzan Finds a Son," I want to specifically mention the young actor playing Tarzan's son—John Sheffield. His movements through the valley and swimming underwater (not sure if a 'stunt double' was used) are lively and innocent, even more endearing than Mickey Rooney in "A Midsummer Night's Dream."</p>
<p>The story is about Tarzan finding a child who survived a plane crash. He and Jane name him "Boy" and love him as their own. Later, the child's uncle comes to the countryside searching for him. Tarzan, unwilling to part with his "treasure," is tricked by Jane and trapped in the valley. She sends the child away, but the uncle plots to seize the inheritance, killing his companion and forcing Jane to accompany him. Unfortunately, they accidentally enter a native tribal area and are captured. Eventually, "Boy" helps them escape. Tarzan leads an elephant troop to rescue them from danger.</p>
<p>There are special effects of Tarzan and the child playing underwater, humorous monkey performances, a charging elephant troop, and footage of various tropical birds and beasts. This should be the most interesting film of the Spring Festival.</p>
<p>"The Private Lives of Elizabeth and Essex" is about Queen Elizabeth's reign and her romance with the Earl of Essex. However, after the Earl's rebellion, Elizabeth ultimately sends him to the executioner's block.</p>
<p>During the two hours in the theater, not only was I moved by the story, but also by Bette Davis's superb acting as Elizabeth, which was extremely inspiring. Through her every move, we seemed to see through her heart, witnessing her inner struggles and conflicts (between empire and love). Yet, she maintained a clear and strong character and the dignity of a queen. I believe this success far surpasses "Of Human Bondage" and "A Longing for You."</p>
<p>The director's editing of the story can be described as concise. Even more endearing is how every scene's emotional atmosphere is strongly grasped. For example, the scenes of Elizabeth stripping the Earl of Essex of his military power and the Earl going to the executioner's block are particularly intense and vivid.</p>
<p>"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" I haven't seen Lon Chaney's silent film, but I dare to say that the remake with sound definitely surpasses the silent film. Under the director's grand and broad vision, he consistently maintained the tense atmosphere given by the story, like a flood rushing straight down, leaving almost no room for the audience to breathe. The depiction of Quasimodo's abnormal psychology is also quite endearing.</p>
<p>Charles Laughton's makeup and acting can be described as perfect. Maureen O'Hara has also improved compared to "The Black Swan." Other roles, such as Louis XI, Count Frollo, and the poet Gringoire, are also well-matched. Worthy of praise.</p>
<h3>Drama Scene Trends</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Since its premiere on New Year's Eve, "Ge Nen Niang" is still sold out every show. Several actors have been performing from the beginning to the end, which is very tiring. Last time, they all fell ill as a result. Now, to regulate the actors' energy, "Ge Nen Niang" will only be performed at night, probably after three or four days, and the daytime performances will be changed to "Nie Hai Hua," originally written by Xiong Fuxi. The director is Li Pingqian.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Art Theatre's "Daughter Country" is a new type of fantasy play, a novel concept on the Chinese stage, and the business is also booming. Because all the actors are on stage this time, a new play cannot be rehearsed, so they are preparing to revive "Love and Death Struggle" after "Daughter Country."</p>
<p>Among many large theater troupes, the Great Bell Theater Troupe is one of the most spirited and successful. Last time, their performance of five one-act plays at the Russian Little Theater on Avenue Foch was praised by both insiders and outsiders. Now, they have invited Xu Xingzhi, the writer and director of "The Seventh Evening," to direct Xia Yan's original "The Wedding Night," scheduled to premiere for four days starting from the Lantern Festival, and the venue will still be the Russian Little Theater.</p>
<h3>Celebrated Peking Opera Actor Ma Lianliang's Fortieth Birthday; Celebrations Being Prepared in the Old Capital's Theater Circle</h3>
<p>— Zhi Ge</p>
<p>The famous actor Ma Lianliang will celebrate his fortieth birthday on the seventeenth of this month, and his wife will also be celebrating her thirtieth birthday this year. Therefore, friends in Peiping (Beijing), have initiated a joint birthday celebration. It is said that the theater circles in Beiping are preparing a grand private performance, hoping to release the oppressive atmosphere under the iron heel of the occupation; In Shanghai, Ma has many old friends, all of whom will send telegrams of congratulations, jointly extending their congratulations. There should be a special grand occasion at that time. Ma has five sons and two daughters, all from his first wife. The eldest son is named Chongren, followed by Chongyi, Chongli, Chongzhi, and Chongxin. The daughters are also grown up and are studying in primary and secondary schools. Except for the eldest son who is learning martial arts, the others do not enter the theater world, perhaps indicating the sentiment of "doing one line and regretting it?"</p>
<p>It is also learned that Mr. Ma will come to Shanghai in two months to perform at the Huangjin Theater. This theater is expected to feature Xi Xiaobo after Cheng Yanqiu's Qiu Sheng Society. The group following Cheng's troupe will be Ma's Fufeng Society.</p>
<h3>An Old Carpenter Is Making a Puppet</h3>
<p>Movie Story</p>
<h3>Adventures of a Wooden Puppet</h3>
<p>— Translated by Yi Fan</p>
<p>Translator's Note: "The Adventures of Pinocchio is originally a world-famous fairy tale." After being adapted by Walt Disney, the creator of Snow White, it was drawn into the second full-color cartoon feature film; and it is said that it will soon be released in Shanghai. This article is excerpted and translated from Disney's original story.</p>
<p>Pinocchio the Puppet</p>
<p>Long, long ago, one evening, the evening star twinkled in the dark sky. Its silvery-white light shone on a small village below, and on a solitary traveler walking alone through this quiet little town. He was Jiminy Cricket, poorly dressed, with a package on his small shoulder. At this time, he was very tired and needed to rest, so he jumped into a house through a window hole.</p>
<p>The fire in the stove inside had not yet gone out. He saw a kind old man making a puppet. This old man was Geppetto, the old carpenter respected by all the villagers nearby. He lived here alone—with only his cat Figaro and his goldfish Cleo as his sole companions—specializing in making and repairing toys for people. He was truly the angel of happiness-making in this village. This was his workshop, which was also his home. The last step of the puppet's work—painting—was completed, and the cat, the goldfish, and Geppetto were all happily smiling. The old carpenter gave him a name: Pinocchio. Pinocchio, what a beautiful name! Just as endearing as his appearance. Look at him sitting there, so spirited. Round face, big eyes, long, pointy nose, wearing a hat on his head with a beautiful feather inserted on it: clever and lovely, looking just like a real boy—but, but he can't speak, can't move. "Wishing Star!" As he went to sleep, Geppetto earnestly prayed to the evening star in the sky, "How wonderful it would be if Pinocchio were a real, living child!"</p>
