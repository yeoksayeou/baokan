<p>社評</p>
<h3>羅斯福接受推選以後</h3>
<p>舉世屬目的美國民主黨大會，旣以百分九十的絕對多數擁戴羅斯福氏蟬聯第三任總統；羅氏旋亦打破其年餘以來一貫的沉默態度，對大會推選，予以接受。這在美國政制史上打破慣例的創舉，居然以膺選人並未直接從事競選的方式而吿實現，這固屬今日美國內外特殊局勢使然，但亦足見羅氏物望之隆與人民嚮往之殷，均非任何前例所能比擬。目前雖然少數分子仍斤於歷史慣例之爭，羅氏亦復謂爲國服務，事惟待決於全國選民的最後志願；吾人深信只要國際局勢不發生重大的意外變動，則富於理智及正義感的美國人民，決不致自隳長城，放棄此一具有國際威望的偉大領袖。</p>
<p>當羅斯福氏柄政之始，在美國正是經濟恐慌之餘，民生凋敝，百端待舉；在國際則侵略暴行已露根芽，逐漸嚴重的危脅着世界的秩序與安寗。羅氏內則措施新政，藉種種社會政策謀經濟的復興，外則繼續支持史汀生的不承認主義，對侵略作不斷的搏鬥。雖以內外牽制孔多，所謀輙左，八年以來的事實成就每每未能與理想符合，戰爭慘禍與侵略行爲反而風靡東西，使全世界過半數的人民遭逢浩刧，而世人事後追憶，轉不能不拳拳服膺羅氏遠慮與先見之過人，因而深致遺憾於少數孤立淺說之流的貽誤事機。此屆羅氏之重膺推選，已足證明美人對羅氏的推崇，已因世變日亟而益趨殷切；但是此後究竟能吾懲前毖後，使羅氏獲有充分自由運用其偉大抱負的機會，則尙爲一待決的問題。最近美政府的對外政策，以及民主黨日前所揭橥的外交政綱，似乎都已不能不爲競選關係所牽掣而暫形消極，同時遠東的野心侵略者流，則頗沾沾自喜，視此爲恣肆的絕好良機。是以由現在以迄美國大選的三個月間，適如本報日前所指出，實爲國際危局的重大關鍵。</p>
<p>羅斯福氏本月十八日接受膺選的廣播演說，懇摯而嚴正、較之近一週中英德兩揆首所發文告之僅斤斤於自國當前機運者，更覺語重心長，中人至深，其中『不論正義或效能，均不能允許以此項偉大事業（保衛美國）委諸任何黨派任何團體」一語，雖屬應有的辭令，亦適足見其胸懷的坦白和曠達。本來在任何民治國家當中，黨派分野，縱有異同，國家利益，則毫無二致，在平時儘管黨同伐異，各具信念，到嚴重關頭則絕不許把黨派私見提高到國家利益以上。羅斯福前此之延攬史汀生諾克斯入閣，已屬組織國民內閣的先聲；此屆民主共和兩黨競選政綱之大同小異，尤可見即在對立的政敵，其政見也並無很大出入。則此後三個月間，美政府當鑒於世變之嚴重，仍本一貫立場及信念，毅然從事於斷然措置，以遏絕侵略暴行：人民方面亦應予當局以種種便利，幸勿以大選關係拘牽其應有的運用，無形中縱容了國際的罪惡，以致到美國大選蕆事之日，也許世界地圖更將有某幾部分繼續變色，而保衛美國的任務，亦將更陷於空前的艱難。</p>
<p>以羅斯福的賢明睿智，相信他絕不會僅斤斤於個人的進退得失，致窒礙其偉大懷抱的發抒。際此一正義與武力之取捨，道德與惡德之取捨，有胆力之行動與錯誤的綏靖政策之取捨一都屆臨嚴重關頭之際，其如何決定如何從違，自然需要取決於人民的公意，但也不能一味佇候等待，而把迫在眉睫的國際危機置之度外。已往羅氏屢有驚人的言論和措置，其影響所及，只有使羅氏地位和威望更趨堅强。目前縱屬大選前夜，羅氏當也不致過分遷就淺陋的流俗見解，坐視太平洋彼岸侵略氣炤的高張。一種驚人的賢明措置，也許會使淺陋自私之輩爲之嚇退，而其澄淸國際危機的效果，也一定會使有識之士對羅氏的擁護更加增加。而且也只有更加積極和堅定，纔見得大選中最偉大的成就。</p>
<h3>美國會暫不考慮　遠東外交新步驟　羅斯福有相機應付之權　美報密切注意日政局及上海局勢</h3>
<p>華盛頓　國會暫時休會、以便議員參加民主黨大會、少數逗留此間之國會領袖、昨晚吿新聞記者云、今年國會並無任何意向促使美國在遠東採取新政策、據國會中人稱，彼等不信國會將執行任何明晰之步驟以對日本、行政部不致延長國會期間以提議新外交政策、惟或將對中立法稍加修正俾政府得予英法難童來美避難者以便利、參議員喬治稱對日禁運法案當不致於此次提出討論、環境亦不需要於此時付之討論、其他國會人士稱、羅斯福總統有絕對之法權應付遠東事件、羅斯福總統以海軍爲其外交工具、國務院爲其談判工具、在出口護照機構上遇有必要時、並有法定權力實施禁運、此間國會人士大半係共和黨人、渠等相信無論何黨不致就遠東形勢發表有關政治之文吿、惟苟一旦就此事有所宣佈、則必將堅決站定立塲、兩黨或皆同意准許行政部視遠東爲純粹外交及非政治地帶、而出以微妙堅定及整齊之態度、（二十一日合衆電）</p>

<p>破壞評價</p>
<p>米糧評價委員會已經三次開會評定市塲買賣洋米最高價格、唯一般投機米商、對於公定價格、竟視若岡聞、猶活躍市塲、掀風興浪、私做買賣、以致各檔米價、不無參差、或竟超越評定價格之外、茲悉米糧評價委員會決秉初衷、設法平衡米價、取締業外投　、制止輾轉買賣、以期穩定滬市整個民食、獎勵檢舉吿密、一經祭覺、卽陳報兩租界當局、嚴厲懲處、故凡米價一經評定公布、務須切實遵守、市塲買賣、祇准在評定價格以下、不得超越逾限、</p>

<h3>法商電車工潮解決　今晨全體復工　昨經奧仁調解認為滿意　工人表示並無政治背景</h3>
<p>法商電車公司　匠間七百餘工人、要求加薪未遂而怠工後、連日經法租界政治部從中調解、因勞資雙方、意見不合、致談判迄無結果、勞方乃於前晨致函法總領事奧仁·納稅華人會·及市商會、請求　解、奧仁氏當於前日午後召見工人代表、勸諭先行復工、要求條件、當有滿意答復、於是工人一部約百餘人、於當晚進廠復工、昨日則因例假休息、惟於下午四時半、勞方代表四人及政治部與資方代表、復集合於公館馬路法總領事署、與奧仁氏舉行談判、至下午六時始行散會</p>
<p>勞方要求條件四項</p>
<p>勞方於談判時、曾提出要求四項、為（一）米價以五十元一石為標準、五十元以內、其津貼照前規定付給、如超過五十元、則超過之數由公司津貼、（二）工友增高工資之限　、應予提高、（三）怠工期內、工資照給、（四）怠工第一日、工友與巡捕冲突而受傷者、由公司貼付醫藥費、</p>
<p>全體工人今晨復工</p>
<p>公司當局對勞方要求幾經磋商、答應（一）米貼每人每日加一角五分、（二）工資普加四成、（三）臨時津貼大工每日扣除三角、小工扣除二角四分（四）允許藥療受傷工友、（五）如卽日復工、怠工期內工資照給、此項答獲、於昨晚經全體工人討論後、認為小工受惠甚少、當卽推派代表、定今日向公司當局提此增加小工工資六成之要求、但對其餘各項、均表滿意、當決定自今晨起、所有怠工工人、全體復工、</p>
<p>工人表示絕無背景</p>
<p>昨據工人方面表示、此次工友怠工、實內最近生活程度高昂不已、工人收入徵小、一家生活、陷於苦痛境地、遂被迫而出此、公司當局曾於上次工人要求加薪時（時米價四十元）聲稱、如米價漲　五十元、當再酌予增加、現米價已超過五十元甚鉅、故工人要求、並無不合理之處、至外傳此次工潮為有背景之「政治」作用、則純係誤解、</p>

<p>無法談判</p>
<p>工潮起因、為公司迫令銅匠間工友楊漢章改做他項工作、楊不願、遂被開除、同時認為公司未能全部履行四月間勞資雙方所訂協定之義務、引起全部工友之反感、遂提出十六項要求改善待遇條件、經公司拒絕、實行怠工、前日上午、工部局派工業科主任顧炳元君從事調解、因公司當局堅決拒絕工人要求、　致無從談判、前日上午十一時、公司當局復揭貼英文布吿一紙、大意謂「今限全部工人於廿二日（今日）晨七時一律復工、否則不給工資、」工人方面、羣情憤激、並將該項布吿、當塲撕毀、形勢惡化、</p>
<p>新廠加入</p>

<h3>所謂「日圓集團」原料供給之實况</h3>
<p>— 慕秀譯</p>
<p>日本於一九三一年佔據滿洲：一九三七年起又佔領中國另一部。其在此等佔據區域內開發富源，以供給其國内土業所需之原料，究達何種程度？本來發展之可能性又如何？當此日本經濟受長期戰事影響巳陷於非正常狀態時，對於此等問题之解答頗為困難。然以今日世界情勢之趨向，此所謂「日圓集團＃富源，對於日本實至重要：其在大陸上冒險行動之成功與否？大部份胥視其能否運用此等富源，使成原料以供其擴張中工業之用為斷。本論所用材料幾全部來自日方，惟據此材料之探討，日本進口總額中，約四分之一係來自此「日圓集團」：然若細加分析，則大有缺點。一部分物品之出產固然增加，但若干其他物品之出產则呈减少：且其移入原料之增加，僅係表示供給之變轉，而非建設之發展，以通货之膨脹，與乎天災之流行，華北已達經濟破產與飢荒之地步矣，满洲重工業發展計劃之實施，尙在半途：正需大量投資；故其對於日本亦與華北同處消耗地位。在資本上，工具上組織上之困難包圍之下，日人之野心能否成功？實熊可疑。——至少，若無外資之幫助，且對其國内及大陸上之政策作有力之調整，則無成功之希望也。</p>
<p>「日圓集團」之輸日，在日本進口總額上所占之百分率，在過去兩年中確有進步，一九三七年為11.6%一九三八年為21.2%至一九三九年為23.4%。然實際情形並不如是動人；因一九三年，中日戰事刧起，日本大量增加第三國之输入，故「日圓集團」輸入之百分率，當然特低。一九二八—三〇年，「日圓集團」在日本貿易上之平均比重27.6%，一九三八—三九22.3%，此滿洲事變前僅增5%，卽此微弱之增加，尙屬日本戰時經濟上需要之膨脹與大陛開發上物資需求之擴張所致。然日本在大陛上探制之富源愈多，則其依賴於第三國之入口貿易亦愈甚：所謂自給自足，徒屬一夢耳。</p>
<p>日本輸入之華北產物，除鐵外過去兩年　，皆有重要增加如下表：</p>
<p>煤之進口增加最速，毛之入口亦有增加；一九三九年棉花及鹽雖已减退，仍較戰前為高。至於「滿洲國」及關東租借地方面之输入，尤見遜色</p>
<p>其間可注意者，為煤之輸入驟减，共他各項貨物，又均無重大增加。而過去兩年間「满洲國」輸日之增加，大半由大豆及豆餅對日輸出增加所致。若再將物價上漲因素加以考慮，则此等输日貿易實在反形减少。究何以故？誠以「日圓集團」區內之重要礦產，與農業富源，固極豐盛；但埋藏之富源與其轉換為原料而可供輸日，兩者間有鴻溝在也。</p>
<p>在中國本部方面</p>
<p>日人之主要努力集中於華北及内蒙：然此方之開發僅屬開始而已。事實上共機構大綱，亦未完全樹立。所謂「華北開發會社」，至今僅組自附屬公司四，以經營電訊鐵路電力及鹽業。該總公司收到之資本為官股四萬五千萬日圓及募得少許債款而已；一切發展事業，均因資本缺乏，交通不便，洪水泛濫，及游擊隊之活動而停頓。今在華北唯一之成就，為輸日煤量之驟增。惟此等增加，得力於荚商之開灤煤礦。該礦一面擴充其產量，一面則轉變其供給方向：卽將以前供給上海及中國其他地方者，今日改輸日本是也。</p>
<p>此種移轉性，在其他華北輪日物產中亦可見之。如鹽棉毛等皆是。惟此等輸日數量，近已逆轉。就棉花一項而論：現在華北棉花之出產，尙不足供當地紗廠需要；該地紗廠之工作率已大受限制；今後若將此類棉花繼輸日，當地紗廠勢必全部停工。而今日華北棉產之銳减，實係中國實施資敵防止政策之收效也。</p>
<p>抑又進者，今日華北食糧大感恐慌，不僅使農民自動將棉田改植稻禾；且削弱華北偽組織之外滬來源；因原可用於物質「建設」之外滬，現皆耗於購入大量食料矣。</p>
<p>華北毛類貿易，以内蒙及其他内地之供給為主。此等貿易，早為日人獨占：然其結果並不良好。第一：因日人有操縱之權力，故其收買價格低賤，於是内地毛貨，不得不另蕁出路；結果使日人控制　華北之毛貨來源頓減。其二：蒙古毛貨，質地粗劣，遠不及澳洲毛貸之優良。日本雖竭力設法改良，但並無多大進步。因所有羊羣，皆在蒙古人手中。</p>
<p>由於華北及滿洲沿海鹽　之開拓，日本自「日圓集團」輸入之鹽大見增加。一九三九年</p>
<p>因華北大水，鹽塲冲壤，藏鹽洗去，故骤形降落；困之一九三九年八月間，有「華北鹽業會社」之組織，為「華北開發會社」之子公司。圖於一九四一年能產鹽二百一十萬公噸。在满洲方面，亦有同樣計劃。</p>
<p>北華煤藏，在世界上至有位置。不惟埋藏量高達二千萬萬噸，品質亦甚優良。然日人尙無法恢復其戰前之產量。今年出產估計為一千二百萬噸，较前年平均一千五百萬噸為俄：且其半數來自開灤煤礦。近日人注意於山西大同之煤礦，交通問题若得解決，則其發展之可能量較大。</p>
<p>關於開發大同煤礦之主張，有加以非議者。認為距離遠，費用大；較之山東各礦為不合算：然日人仍繼續作開發該處磺藏之計劃。一九四〇年一月，有「大同煤礦公司」組織，資本為偽滿圓四千萬元。牛由內蒙偽組織負責，半由「華北開發會杜」及南滿鐵道株式會社平分應募。照預定計劃，該礦於一九四〇年中須出煤二百五十萬噸，至一九四一年則須為四百萬噸：其產量目標為每年二千六百萬噸。</p>
<p>為排除交通不便之障礙計，有若干方案之倡議。主要者為建設塘沽港之十年計劃。據聞大同塘沾鐵路建築工程已經着手進行。此綫長五百公里，預定四年完成，需費一萬九千萬日圓。此足以證明在中國資源可供日用以前，必需有大量之投資與建譏也。當此華北無力維有戰前之產量，而滿洲方面之輸日亦形减退之時，設非開灤出產數量增加，則日本之煤荒必更有甚於今日</p>
<p>在滿洲方面</p>
<p>满洲之「開發」已歷八載，自一九三二至一九三九年間，日人投資總額達三十億日圓。然日本所獲之報償則極微。此非滿洲富源之不足，乃係軍事目標從事投資之結果。關東軍控制之下，日本資本家並無投資自由，所有满洲之發展開拓，均歸一官方與半官方之公司所專利操縱。其開發並非注重於增加運日原料之生產，與促進農產之增加，而係關東軍所推行之巨大重工業計劃，企圖能於大陸上樹一工業根據地。所謂五年計劃者卽此。始於一九三七年，推行颇為努力，尤以鋼鐵礦產水力石炭液化等工業為最，此等計劃，實行上端賴德國之合作。已往「满洲國」常以大豆與德交換機械，但自歐戰爆發後，貿易中止，此五年計劃，固之無法進行，今日之「满洲國」巳陷困境；投資雖巨，而事業建設尙在中途：前途渺茫，距計劃完成之期尙遠。乃不得不修改計劃，目前似注重於煤鐵及輕金屬之出產以備輸日。</p>
<p>關東軍推行工業計劃之結果，且使「滿洲國」在經濟上成為日本之排水渠。卽僅在分取日本之資本，而不能對日本有所資助。蓋日本在滿所得原料，除大豆豆餅外，無何增加。但「满洲國」對於資本工具消費品之需要則銳增，日本在滿開拓之賭金日益浩大，但其報償，何時可達？則未可知也。日本對满之鉅大出口中，若干物品之原料，係日本以外匯由第三國購進製造者，雖不能確知：然為數必巨，則無疑也。</p>
<p>「满洲國」對日原料之供給並未盡量，煤炭一項為極好例證。滿洲煤藏雖不若華北豐富，惟其分佈亦頗廣闊。加計新近發見者，埋藏量已從戰前估計之四十八萬萬噸提高至二百萬萬噸之上。最大者為南滿鐵道株式會社之撫順煤礦與滿洲炭礦株式會杜所屬之礦區，彼等之產量雖已增加，但並未能與在滿新興工業及鐵路之煤炭需要並進。「满洲國」之煤荒，與日本國内同樣嚴重。</p>
<p>關於石油方面，除阜新札賚諾爾之試騐油井所產微量，及近日所聞在「通化省」內發見之新油礦外，满洲油源，僅限於石油岩及石炭液化工業而已。此種液化工業，具中等规模；已開始生產，但因德國機器供給之斷絕，又受重大打擊。按原定計劃将設四廠，今則僅南滿在撫順之一廠始得開始工作。但其產量仍極為有限。</p>
<p>一九三〇年起，甫滿在撫順，雖已有石岩油之製練。去年產頟已達三十五萬噸，預定至一九四一年底可達一百萬噸。撫順石油岩儲藏量頗豐，但在目前之煤荒中，亦屬徒然。故其產量尙遠在「满洲國」本身需要之下。惟因一部份粗油，與日本海軍有特別合同，不得不輸往日本。而滿方自用者，則不得不再從外洋輸入。</p>
<p>满洲礦藏固屬重要，農業仍為社曾經濟之基礎：然屬工礦業較，則實遠不受日方重視。農產物之產量，僅維持事變前之數。若干農產且呈下跌。惟「滿洲國」近巳開始注重農業之發展。按農產物約占滿洲對日輸出之半，其中大部為大豆及豆餅，更包有油籽絲及羊毛等。過去兩年間，大豆豆餅输日之增加，乃因日圓集團通貨膨脹，豆價上昇所致，但對第三國之出口則减少；惟當時對德意之出口尙未减退。及歐戰起，德意市塲亦相繼消减。於是更增大對「日集團」以內地方之輸出，如此情形，並非佳象。</p>
<p>一九三六年時，日本自滿洲方面所得銑鐵為二十七萬一千公噸。占銑鐵進口27%；從中國所得鐵礦為一百二十六萬四千公噸，占31%。近來數字，雖因日本不加公佈，無從知悉：但就中國貿易報告觀之，可見過去三年間，對日鐵礦輪出猛跌：卽從一九三六年之一百三十萬公噸跌成一九三九年之為十萬公噸是也。</p>
<p>中國重要礦區，雖已大半落於日人手中；但其出產仍顯著减退。此項礦區，包括現有長江區各礦，及察哈爾境內未開發之龍烟礦藏，華中鐵礦產額之恢復，似屬可能：但華北察哈爾境內之龍烟鐵礦，則無多大希望。去夏日本已有龍烟鐵礦會社之組織，資本二千萬日圓；同時並自此開築支綫以與平綏鐵路相接，但現在產最僅數十萬噸而巳。除龍烟鐵礦外，日人更在北平附近石景山，重設二百五十噸之鼓風鑪，從事鎔煉：並在山西接收若干小規模之鎔礦爐。然今日日本在華所得礦石，大部尙來自長江。</p>
<p>滿洲方面之鋼鐵工業，雖受注重，但數年來輸日並不出色。其情况與煤產同。所有增加之出產，為當地需要加高所抵銷。滿洲鋼鐵工業之擴展，實始於十年前礦質惡劣問題解決之後。生鐵之出產一九二九年為二十一萬噸，一九三七年已昇至七十六篱二千峨。一九三六年有一鍊網廠成立，翌年五年計劃卽行開始；一九三九年春，昭和製鋼株式會杜之製造銑鐵及鋼之能力，各增至一百七十萬噸及五十八萬噸。本溪湖鐵廠亦計劃使其產量自十五萬提高至五十萬嘶。然此等計劃，皆受焦煤及建築材料之缺乏所阻碍。昭和去年之鋼鐵出產已形减退；本漠湖六百噸鎔爐兩座，自一九三七年興工以來，亦因原料缺乏，迄未完成。竣工至早當在一九四〇年六月之後。</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>就各方面觀之，日本對於圓集團原料富藏之開發，僅屬開始而已；在華北埋藏之煤鐵幾全未發掘；日本雖從大陸獲得較前為多之原料供給，但仍處於「下種施肥」之候。當此在華消耗戰持續中，日本對於開發華北及完成在滿僅屬起始之重工業計劃上所需資本與工具之籌措，實感萬分困難。然此兩地之開發負擔，全部均須由日本任之，然日本又絕無單獨發展之能力。是以在今日情况之下，此兩地可謂為日本之絆腳石，而非其生命綫也。</p>

<h3>金融述評</h3>
<p>— 聖凱瓊</p>
<p>——七月二十日止——　（續）</p>
<p>前面是從推行法幣制度上說法幣發行增加的必然性，但是亦不能認為法幣的增加原因百份之百是如此，另外尙有戰事的原因和經濟的原因，以及財政的原因。所謂戰事的原因，是由於東南半壁，最先受到侵略的禍害，中產以上的人民，或於事前遷避，或隨華軍西遷，在這人口大變遷中，往往提出過去在銀行的存款，留置身邊，以供生活費用，結果遂成對於法幣底大量需要，因之法幣發行的數量乃形增加。所謂經濟的原因，是由於西南西北各省在戰前向以「金融枯竭，資本短缺，貨藏於地，無從開發」著稱，戰事發生後，尤其在戰事西移軍事政治經濟重心亦隨以俱去之後，為維持長期作戰起見，對於經濟建設，開發蘊藏，不遺餘力，因之需要大量的資金；又因中國作戰的基礎主要的在於農業，對於農業貸款更是雷厲風行，努力以赴—如四聯總處所擬定的農貸四萬萬元，結果法幣的發行額因各方需要資金的切急，乃隨四行金融綱的展佈而增加。所謂財政上的原因，在戰時中國政府所發救國國防軍需建設振濟等國幣公僅，二十八年止共計二十二萬三千萬元，四行在職責所關，多少要認購或受押一點，則在銀行借貸表上，一方面增加有價證券和抵押放款底資產，一方面亦增加了兌換券發行底負債。此外中國政府在戰時的努力收集金銀，華僑對西南西北的投資，滙款的增加，國外的捐輸，這些金銀外匯，統須以法幣去收兌，亦是法幣發行增加的一因</p>
<p>總之，法幣增加的原因，主要的在於法幣制度尙未普遍推行全國，以及開發西南西北，實行經濟建設，以達抗建目標，其次是在於收兌金銀，以及人民的留藏，而由於戰時的財政手段者，實在是很少的。</p>
<p>建設金公債的發行</p>
<p>根據路透社重慶　公　消息，說中國將發行新公債計軍需公債　　萬元，復興金公債英金一千萬鎊，美金五千萬元，垵二月十　日行政院會議曾通過民國　　九年軍需公債及建設金公債發行原則及條例草案、但　　公債條例並未見公布過，而建設金公債條例，業由國府在二月　日公布。</p>
<p>此處須加指出的，卽將發行的新公債應是軍需公債，和建設金公債，所謂復興金公債應是一半尙未發行的建設金公債，軍需公債條例內容現在無從覔取，金公債的主要內容如下：</p>
<p>國民政府為籌集建設事業經費，所以發行英金公債一千萬鎊，美金五千萬元，一律分兩期發行，第一期是五月一日，第二期是十一月一日，每期各五百萬英鎊和二千五百萬美金元，年利率五厘，前兩年祇付利息，自民國三十一年起開始還本，每六個月抽筏還本付息一次。債票分英金一千·一百·五十·十·五鎊五種，美金分五千·一千·一百·五十·十·五元六種。</p>
<p>購買建設金公債的貸幣，除掉以英金美金或其他外幣或外滙依當時比價折合美金英金外，亦可以法幣按財政部規定的商滙掛牌，滙價折合美金英金計算，依認購人的指定而發給英金債票或美金債票。這一項規定是過去所發的二十七年金公債認購方法中所無，允為建設金公債發行方法的特點，能夠利於該金公債的推銷，其理由是：　（未完）</p>

<p>捕蝗古法（三）</p>
<p>蝗之為災，必與旱同時，天隆雪雨，蝗且瀕死，以其飛行不能，而又飽食體重，沾濡於積潦之中，必漲爛而死也。旣在旱時，又當苦熱，赤日行空，翅簿而燥，着火卽焦，誠於飛近田間之際，束薪然炬，齊向空中舉發，則觸熱而顛，大半翅焦足脫，卽遺落田中，不難收拾。或疑蝗之多也，東阡西陌，分隊而來，恐不能徧應之，然農人各守其隴，當此災旱之時，或桔　取水，或芟耘非種，正無日不在田中預備火攻器具，不難各自火燒。且待飛墜肆食之後，從而捕取，雖徧畦皆是，密無隙縫，可以操畚挶而滿盛之，究不如焚之較為速也。去年旱幾成災，蝗已四出，聞飭役僱夫之外，竟至點營兵列隊而往，儼如大廠當前，雖曰蝗多，未免小題大做矣。况捕之之法，亦止搜括田間，放諸巨流之中，他無策也。營兵不嫻農功，又大率粗暴性成，分投搜捕，保無踐踏禾稼之虞，固不如令民自捕之為愈也。捕而殺之，其事較難，又不若用火焚之之為愈也。</p>

<h3>器物銘</h3>
<p>— 靜方</p>
<p>古代君子，於日常用物，就其性質，而著為銘，以作警惕，在砥礪道德陶冶性情上，頗有幫助。發軔於湯的盤銘，所謂「苟日新日日新對又日新」是也。明代王褘，曾有器物銘二十首，說理明白而切要，可以糾世道，正人心，茲錄數則如下：</p>
<p>冠銘：爾形之端，故居我元。吾德苟或愆，曷居人之先</p>
<p>履銘：義之趨，信之踐，毋蹈非，毋臨險。</p>
<p>蓆銘：我身之逸兮，藉爾以為偃也。我心之直兮，匪爾之可捲也。</p>
<p>衾銘：舉而施之，庇乎一體，苟能推之，覆幬乎遐邇。</p>
<p>笥銘：非義勿納，非禮勿發。</p>
<p>鏡銘：貌之妍醜，爾則辨其外，心之淑慝，爾曷鑒其內。</p>
<p>櫛銘：髮之亂也，可以理之，政之棼也，曷以治之。</p>
<p>尺鉻：百分之積，乃成乎尺，尺而復累，我不知其止。學之為功固如是：。</p>
<p>觚銘：以此書文常恩明，以此書事常思平，以此書獄常思生，以此書財常思輕。</p>

<h3>提倡穿短衣的我見</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>陳乃超君為了實行穿短衣而遭到電梯司機人的白眼，這自然是事質，因此也不容否認上海人確有「衹重衣衫不重人」的惡習，我們窮措大偶而跑到大菜館去赴宴，大旅社去訪友，眼瞧着僕役侍者們對於服飾華麗者的殷勤接待，而自己所見到的祇是冷冰冰的神氣，也許誰都有點不平之感，那麽穿斌衣有點跡近下流，受人白眼自是意中事了！</p>
<p>中國式短衫樣式的不大高明，基於傅統觀念與心理作用，是無可諱言的。然而實際上的不够大方與美觀，要亦給認為「小家氣」的原因之一。但每一個改革能够成功與否，必需建築在倡導者的效力與羣衆的擁護之上，自少数人的倡導到多數人的實行，中間要經過不少歧視，不少磨折，没有百折不回的勇氣，沒有一致奉行的步驟，即使一個很合乎理想的改革，却還是要失敗無疑。</p>
<p>因此，我們屏去大方美觀等等問題，卽以提倡穿短衣而言，唯一的先决條件，還是在於怎樣倡導？下列幾點，也許值得參考：</p>
<p>一：社會名流，應當率先倡導，如對於普通集會或平常應酬約宴等等，隨時以身作則。</p>
<p>一：商店，公司，行，號，（除原有制服者外）約束職員穿短衣，以期行動敏捷，最好能按照中國國貨公司勸令職員練習生穿制服，得予以免費洗滌的獎勵。</p>
<p>一：機關，學校（除原穿制服背外）允許敎師職員穿短衣上課辦公。</p>
<p>一：短农裁製，切忌與時下一般特殊階級者所穿的相同，令人瞧了發生惡感。</p>
<h3>經濟的維他命C</h3>
<p>— 愛農</p>
<p>維他命是對於我们身體上很有關係的營養素，能保持身體正常的發育和健康，若缺乏了紲他命，便形成很嚴重的後果，而紲他命的種類很多，故所生的後果也有不同：缺乏了縱他命A，體重就减少，而形成發育不良的病症。缺乏維他命B，就容易生脚氣病。缺少維他命C，發生壞血病，血液逐渐破壞，便有死亡的危險。缺乏維他命D，形成佝僂病和牙齒痛，减弱身體牴抗力。維他命E，對於繁殖上有關，還有維他命F……；它們的發現還很短促，不過二十多年的歷史，有的剛發現了不久，還不　分明瞭和人體的關係，有的科學家正在研究中，不久的將來，維他命的研究或許更有進展哩。</p>
<p>現當夏令，在道幾天的小菜塲上到處可以發見鮮紅光澗的番茄，可知今年的產量很豐饒，市塲上的番茄是供過於求，價格便很低廉，一毛大洋竟可買到十多隻。番茄是富有維他命C的食物，對於我們很有利益，它的功效和花旗橘子不相上下，而花旗橘子不是我們所能吃得起的，一隻竟要一元左右，而番茄只有一分錢一隻，但兩者的效果是同樣，那是何樂而不為呢？要是到藥屏去買一西西的純粹維他命C，恐怕要把你嚇出來。所以番茄倒是一樣價廉物美的營養品。不過我們中國人不十分喜歡吃有的把它燒湯，但番茄非生吃不可，若把它燒煮一下，它所含有的維他生C就會失去效力。所以我們把賈來的番茄用清水來洗一洗，把它外面的一層皮剝去，蘸些糖吃下去，便萬無一失的了，它雖是帶有一些青草氣，但看它的營養力面上，只得抱着好比喝苦藥般的吃下去，其實它的青草氣是微乎其微。所以我是提倡吃番茄者，因為它是大衆化的營養品呀！</p>
<h3>二個住的故事</h3>
<p>— 范舉暉</p>
<p>眞宗的時候，有一位李文靖公，他是太原人，在河南開封縣，做宰相，他造了一所居第於當地封邱門內，他的議事廳前只可容旋馬，那時候他的朋友問他。「公。你的居第為什麼造得這樣狹小」？</p>
<p>李文靖公微笑的回答：「我的居第將來要傅給子孫，現在我身為國家的宰相，當然是比較太小，但是將來我的子孫，做小官職時，一定覺得太寬闊些吧？</p>
<p>他的朋友愕無言。</p>
<p>古希臘有一位大哲學家，蘇裕拉蒂，他存講學時候，因為他的需要造了一間住所：那間住所竟小得像箱子一股。他的鄰居很奇怪的問他道：「先生，你是一位當代的偉大人物，為什麽造了這樣小的住所呢？」</p>
<p>蘇格拉蒂回答道：「假使我這一間小小的住所能够容滿我忠實的朋友於一堂，我已是十分的快樂了。」</p>
<h3>辨別方向的方法</h3>
<p>— 哀敏</p>
<p>方向有東南西北之別。假使有一個人要到東方某地去，如果他不向東方走，而向西方走，除了繞地球一週外，再無別的方法能够達到某地。所以，當我們出外遠行的時候，在荒山野地迷失了歸途，雖明知回去的時候祇要向南走就能够到家，但不知那個方向是朝南，於是心裏搖搖不定沒有了主意，尤其是單獨出外，或黑夜裏，在不見人跡的地方，更覺恐怖之至，如果隨意瞎走，那末，更是危險的專。</p>
<p>我們既知道迷失路徑的危險，必須要想出一個辨別方向的方法來，我所說的辨別方向的好方法，並不是說去購置一隻指南針，因為指南針這樣東西並不是個個人都佩有的。所以這個辨別方向的好方法，祇好用腦力去推測，例如觀測太陽的出沒，便是一個辨別方向的好方法，其他如觀察植物的陰腸和風吹的方向，都是辨別方向的好方法。</p>
<p>觀察植物的陰陽，必先觀察它那裏濕潤那裏生青苔，濕潤的地方和生青苔的地方都是陰面，反之是陽面，陰為北，陽為南，這是第一種辨別方向的好方法。</p>
<p>風的方向四季不同，大概在春天裏晴朗乾燥的天氣多東南風，潮濕落雨的夭氣多東風：在夏天裏天睛時多南風或東南風，落雨時多北風；在秋天裏風多捉摸不定，不能確定；在冬天多西風和西北風。但有時候風力微弱，一時不能測知風的方向，可向空中撒土或灰沙，看它飛向那一方，有樹木的地方更可以仔細觀察樹葉飄動的方向。這是第二種辨別方向的好方法。</p>
<p>如果到了夜裏，對於植物的陰陽面既看不清楚，要是再加上沒有風，那麽，豈不是糟了，但不要緊，你可以瞧天上去找北極星或北斗星，如果給你找着了那就是北方。其餘可依此類推，這也是一種辨別方向的好方法。</p>
<p>除了以上的三種辩別方向的好方法以外，尙有許多比較複雜的方法，非簡單筆墨所能盡述，以上三種如能用於實際，是百無一失的，因為筆者早巳一一試驗過的了。</p>
<h3>希特勒的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 江旅</p>
<p>最近的世界政治舞台上，最走紅的名角，要算德元首希特勒了。他的生活情形，當然是大家所關心的，現在我來簡略的介紹一下：</p>
<p>衣：希氏對衣着方面，素來不注重，尋常只穿着棕衫的制服，或是一身藏青嗶嘰的，此外就是一襲雨衣和一頂帽子。一九三四年六月，希氏和意首相墨索里尼會晤的時候，隨員們當時只替希氏帶了便服，當他走下飛機時，看見墨氏和義方歡迎的人員，全穿了制服，那時，希氏很窘，他疑心隨員們有意捉弄他，因此把他們申斥了一頓。</p>
<p>食：希氏是一位素食者，但對於烹調的方法，卸很講究。有一次，墨索里尼宴請他的時候，他破例地吃了兩隻煎蛋。有時，他也喝一些咖啡，每星期有一二次到凱薩霍夫旅館（國社黨上台前的機關部）去喝朱古力茶。希氏對烟酒是絕端痛惡的，他不但自己摒絕，且不許旁人在他身旁抽烟。</p>
<p>住：希氏的辦公處，在柏林威廉街的總理府邸，在同街百碼外的總統府，他是很少去的，因他不願意人民回想到總統時代的德圈。總理府邸，在希氏秉政俊，曾修理過一次，裝修全用最新式的玻璃和金屬，希氏本人，曾幫着設計，擘畫描繪的是北歐神道武敦Wotan的故事。府前有一所洋台，遇有大典的時候，希氏常站在上面檢閱。據說客廳下面還築有一個避彈的地窖。希氏的私邸，在明興，建築得十分富麗。在貝樞特斯加登BerchteSgaden　(巴凡里亞南部一小村)希氏有一個別墅Hans　Wachenfeld，從那個由阿的建築裏，可以望見他的故鄉—舆地利，希氏公餘之暇，常到這兩處去休憇的。</p>
<p>行：為了安金，希氏的行動，是極端秘密的，誰都不知道他下一次要到什麽地方。他出門常坐最高速率Mercedes牌子的汽車及安穩的飛機。火車，是不常坐的。當希氏坐着最高速率的汽車出行時，三個褐衫衛隊坐在希氏後面，希氏本人，却坐在汽車夫的旁邊。有時，那些衛隊，不坐在車中，站在希氏汽車的車板上，右手都攀着手槍的開關，以資警戒。至於路上，當希氏的汽車經過時，戒備自然十分嚴密。在飛機中，希氏從不和人談天，運動一動或笑一笑的機會也很少，這或許是他要保持領袖的尊嚴，才這樣的。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>焱夏的天氣，熟得使人飯也吃不下，過於油腻的東西，眞使人望而生畏；所以這幾天我們常吃冷拌的菜。冷絆的菜，最普通的莫如香椿拌豆腐，不必用醬油，只須用精鹽和在豆腐中，把鹽漬過的香椿切細丁，再加麻油一同拌和，吃起來無論佐粥佐飯，都很爽口。葷菜中最可口的，莫如生菜麻醬拌鷄絲，在夏季筵席的冷盆中常占主要的地位。可是家常吃鷄，實在太貴，只得以肉絲為代。此外如肉絲伴粉皮蝦米拌黄瓜，葱油或海蜇拌蘿蔔絲等，都是家常菜中的應時妙品。</p>

<h3>論工部局重行估價房租事</h3>
<p>— 王平</p>
<p>前公共租界以財政收支不敷，且相差甚巨，乃一方裁减局內職員，以資節省支出；一方提議於本年七月一日開始增收土地稅及市政總捐（卽房捐）各百分之五十，此舉雖加重公共租界內居民之負担，然以鑒於局方之苦衷，故斯項提議，終於本年四月十七日得納稅人之通過。</p>
<p>加捐之舉，乃於七月一日實行矣，然當吾人接獲付捐之通知時，見土地稅除照加附稅百分之五十外，其房捐之徵收額，竟以上月重行估價之房租微以百分之十八，又益以附稅百分之五十，結果同一房屋，其現估之房租，竟較昔日所估者增加十餘倍，而其微收之稅額，以益以附稅之故，其增加之比率，更爲驚人。</p>
<p>吾人以鑒於工部局處此非常時期內所遭遇之艱難，故雖當本身亦處於經濟十分困苦之際，仍概允增付百分之五十之土地稅及市政總捐附稅，然工部局似不甚瞭解吾等納稅人之苦衷，將房租重行估價，並增加之驚人之倍數，藉以增益其稅收，至是否人不免誹議工部局舉措之不妥，敢將其理由試述之如下。</p>
<p>（一）本次重行估價房租，僅限於公共和界內之中國式房屋（如平房等），故房捐依新估租價而微收者，僅限於是項房屋，此舉似有失公正之道，蓋聞界內共他各式房屋於明年一月一日，始依新估租値微收房捐，則工部局又何薄於中國式房屋，而於半年前之今日卽依新估租値徵收之耶？</p>
<p>（二）又此次所估之房租，甚不合理，同一房屋，僅因時間之不同，而所估之價，竟較昔日所估者大十數倍。聞局內捐務處某高級職員云：雖大三數十倍者亦有之，如詢以何以有如是之增値，則必難以回答也。蓋土地因交通發展等原因而增巨値者有之，然房屋則旣未翻新，復未添建，而能增如是巨大之租値者，實無理由可言。如云因戰事期間租界內人口擁擠關係，則按之實際，現在房租較之戰前，雖有增加，然並無如是之巨，且工部局亦不免有鼓勵房主提高其房租之嫌疑矣。</p>
<p>（三）如工部局將來重新估價廠屋或商店房屋（聞將於明年一月一日開始），則按已發生之事實觀之，必增其估價，工商各業卽可藉口營業費用因房捐之故而增加，而提高其貨品之售價，此種結果，將使工部局所採壓平物價步序之效力，受相當之影饗。</p>
<p>總之，在此戰事進行期內，凡在中國境內之各國人民，皆備嘗艱苦，上海之居民，何能獨免耶？然工部局亦應與界內居民共分甘苦，互諒苦衷，欲知公共租界之繁榮，繋於公共租界內居民之經濟富裕，如彼等過於貧困，則不特公共租界之繁榮，不能存在，卽界內治安，亦大足成問題也。</p>
<h3>工部局注目於二房東暴利</h3>
<p>— 蕭明</p>
<p>十七日本報本埠新聞欄內刊有一則新聞，爲「工部局討論房租問題，注目於二房東暴利，」大意謂：業主加租者，比戰前大抵僅一成，而二房東加於三房客者却有兩倍有餘。而後者據生活費指數指示：高漲約百分之二百〇五。</p>
<p>這一消息，在作爲「三房客」的我們聽來，當然是非常愉快的，我們覺得二房東加於三房客者，奚僅兩倍有餘，三倍有餘也可說是比比皆是的了</p>
<p>增加租界治安的困難的，當然有很大的「原因」在，然而市民生活的不安定，而由此滋生出來的所謂「罪惡」，當然有很多很多的。大者偷竊盜取欺詐不算，而小焉者每個屋頂下的「口舌之爭」，如果每月有所統計的話，那我想其數字之長，恐怕會打破世界一切數字之記錄，而使人驚恐不置的吧！</p>
<p>人類生活在現今，已可說是痛苦極點了，然而單單爲了「住」的問題，五百萬大上海的市民，恐怕有百分之九十九都是在痛苦之中的吧！這樣說來，工部局能够注意及於二房東的「暴利」，非但對大上海大多數的市民在物質上稍謀解放，而在精神上，也是替市民有了一個好的打算。</p>
<p>今天報上，又有工部局對於「房物估價不宜過高」的消息，說「當局已予嚴密注意，各方深盼今後能嚴格限制二房東之過分利得，在當局亦不宜爲捐稅關係，對若干房屋，予以過高之估價，庶房租問題，得漸决調整，而回復合理之常態。」這里値得注意的，就是工部局自七月份起增加捐稅，已給予二房東以「暴利」之機會了！就以我之住處而說：二房東藉工部局增稅已向三房客暴利式地加租了。工部局加於二房東的捐稅的爲一每季」十元左右，可是二房東加於我們三房客者，却是「每月」十餘元！</p>
<p>工部局對於二房東之「暴利」，雖已在「注意」，然而尙無具體辦法公佈，我敢以這末大胆地代表大上海大多數的市民的意見，向工部局與公董局提出我的意見來，卽：</p>
<p>—卽日起，開始調查各三房客付於二房東之房金，如有過分「暴利」者，應予嚴懲！</p>
<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第三章　對立的情報</p>
<p>霍桑父問道：「爲什麽？難道這大鬥每夜不下鎖的嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，下鎖的，而且大半是我鎖的，除非王小姐回來時太晏，那才由伊自己下鎖，伊也有大鬥上的鑰匙。不過昨夜裏我瞧見王小姐還在客室裏，客人還沒有去，故而我不曾下鎖。」</p>
<p>倪金壽分明聽得了重要的關子，再也耐不住靜默。他放了筆，豎直了身子，忘形骸似地搶着發問：「有客人嗎？幾個？誰？」</p>
<p>倪金壽一連串充滿著熱烈希望的問句，却祇換得老毛張一張鼠目，搖一搖頭，接連著的是一句：「我不知道。」</p>
<p>倪金壽忽發火似地說：「什麼不知道？你一回兒說有客人，一回兒又不知道？你可是想在我們面前放刁？」</p>
<p>霍桑在這價局又一度展開之下，從嘴裏拿下了紙燜，乘勢將手向倪金壽搖一搖。</p>
<p>他問道：「老毛，你說得明白些。你怎樣知道王小姐那時候有客人？」</p>
<p>老毛答道：「我進門時曾向這窗口望一望，裏面燈光很亮，窗帘却拉滿。我瞧不見什麼，但聽得裏面有談話聲音，我自然猜想得到有客。」</p>
<p>「可曾聽得什麼說話？」</p>
<p>「沒有，祇聽得一個是男子的聲音，一個是王小姐。他們說話的聲音不高，雨聲又大，我也因着頭昏，沒有仔細聽。」</p>
<p>「他們的說話你雖聽不淸楚，但那男子的聲音是誰，你也許聽得出來罷？」</p>
<p>老毛壁又用手抹他的額角，一壁又搖頭道：「聽不出。我在輕輕關大門時，聽得那男子的笑聲比較高一些，可是我也辨不出是誰。」</p>
<p>倪金壽忽又禁不住揷口說：「可會是余甘棠？」</p>
<p>老毛向那偵探長瞧了一瞧，疑遲地說：「這個我不敢亂說——我想不像是他。我想他和王小姐旣然閙過，見面時，也笑不出來。」　（五二）</p>
<h3>藥渣的來歷</h3>
<p>— 王滄萍</p>
<p>幼時讀筆記，見有藥渣倒在路上，因病人家中，深恐醫生開方有誤，所以將藥渣倒在路上，以備路過的醫生，將藥渣詳細檢騐，然後再問病情，始可辨別，前醫用藥是否得當。蓋從前醫生，大都存心濟世，故其行踪，類似苦行頭陀，到處爲人治病，藥渣倒在門前，亦可爲家有病人之標記，所以昔人稱醫生，爲行醫也。求諸現在之醫生，實有不勝今昔之感矣。</p>
<h3>時機與命運</h3>
<p>— 平平</p>
<p>有一個親戚，在幾月前發了些投機財，一時汽車也坐了，舞塲也跑了，小少爺」走出來是大姐跟班的，數數就是三個，眞是不可一世。戚友之間，誰也得對他多看一眼，最好希望自己能和這位貴人視綫接觸這麼一下，互相假笑一次，就覺得光榮萬分。於是也常聽人譽，他本來相貌就不凡，何况現在時機一至，那得不發呢</p>
<p>幾月後的今天，親友間又在傳說了：「某人現在投機賠本了，汽車賣了。」接着也就有人說，他時機不好，運氣轉了。</p>

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly Battle Situation, July 14th to 20th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission stated that since July 14th to 20th this week, the Chinese armies on all fronts have achieved significant victories. The defection of a large number of puppet troops in central Hubei and southern Shandong, as well as Zhang's troops in eastern Henan, is particularly sufficient to fundamentally strike at Japan's strategy of invading China. As for the Japanese army stirring up trouble on the Zhejiang coast, they have been met with fierce attacks by brave Chinese soldiers and have suffered heavy losses. Despite these defeats, the Japanese are still constantly sending reinforcements to invade, and the fighting is gradually intensifying. Regarding the course of the battles, the more important aspects are approximately as follows:</p>
<p>Zhejiang: Starting on the morning of the 16th, the Japanese launched a fierce offensive against the vicinity of Zhenhai, Zhejiang, by sea, land, and air. Chinese officers and soldiers met them head-on, and after a fierce battle until evening, many Japanese warships were sunk by the Chinese and the damaged ones retreated.

On the 15th, the Japanese army in Fuyang attempted to cross the Fuchun River in separate routes, landing on Dongsha Island east of Fuyang. Their vanguard was repelled by the Chinese. On the 16th and 17th, the Japanese sent reinforcements to attack fiercely again, but the Chinese army fought bravely, preventing them from succeeding and forcing them to retreat to their original positions. At the same time, a unit of the Chinese army took advantage of the situation to enter Xiaoshan City,斬馘killing countless enemies.</p>
<p>Hubei: The Chinese army advancing towards Suixian has captured many outer strongholds in recent days and has also charged into the city,斬獲killing countless enemies. The puppet troops stationed in Suixian have completely defected and responded to the National Army. A unit of the Japanese remnants near Yuxi River was surrounded and fiercely annihilated by the Chinese on the 16th, with hundreds killed and many Japanese vehicles destroyed. Furthermore, the Chinese army in southern Hubei has been fiercely attacking the strategically important Shihuiyao (east of Daye) on the Yangtze River for days, and after defeating the stubborn Japanese resistance, they charged into the city,纵横斬殺killing countless enemies. Shihuiyao is an important stronghold for the Japanese and puppet forces' Yangtze River transportation between Han and Xun, and there is a railway directly to the Xiangbishan iron mine. After the Chinese captured it, the Japanese Yangtze River transportation was controlled by the Chinese, and the Japanese attempt to develop the iron mine was also thwarted by the Chinese.</p>
<p>Shanxi and Henan: In southern Shanxi, the Japanese troops wreaking havoc southwest from Jincheng in Boping and other places were routed by the Chinese, suffering heavy casualties and fleeing in disarray. Currently, there are no traces of the Japanese in that area or its vicinity. Furthermore, over a thousand Japanese troops advancing from the Tianjingguan and Sichuan areas on the 14th were intercepted by the Chinese en route, and by the morning of the 15th, they retreated back to Tianjingguan. As for the Japanese troops advancing towards northwestern Shanxi, they were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army on multiple routes and suffered heavy losses. Currently, there are no traces of the Japanese in the Hequ and Baode areas. The Chinese army in eastern Henan has been sweeping up the Japanese remnants near Haoxian in recent days,斬獲 killing many. They are still continuing their mopping-up operations. The Chinese army in southern Henan has been fiercely attacking various outer strongholds of Xinyang in recent days, and once attacked as far as the North Gate of Xinyang,斃日 killing countless Japanese soldiers and completely destroying the transportation between Xinyang and Han. The Japanese trapped in Xinyang are in extreme panic.</p>
<p>Eastern Shandong: A unit of Japanese and puppet infantry, artillery, and cavalry in Changyi, eastern Shandong, has been advancing towards the areas of Shibu and Zhuangdong Village south of the city for days. The Chinese met them head-on and engaged in a fierce battle. Under the cover of artillery fire, the Japanese charged repeatedly. The Chinese army, in order to lure the Japanese deeper, retreated towards the left and right flanks. The Japanese entered Shibu, whereupon the Chinese immediately surrounded them and launched a heroic annihilation battle. Currently, Shibu has been recaptured. The Japanese remnants retreated into Gao埠 (Gaobu), Rizhao (日照) County. The Japanese sent reinforcements in several routes, but were all repelled. Currently, the Chinese army is still surrounding and annihilating the Japanese remnants with heroic and valiant姿態. Another 5,000 or so puppet troops under Zhao Yizeng in southern Shandong were stationed in Linqu, Yidu, Linxiang, Changle, Yishui, Mengyin, Huantai, and Shouguang counties, occupying a total of twenty-six strongholds, which the Japanese valued highly. However, the officers and soldiers of this unit were deeply aware of the righteous cause and recently all defected, with over twenty strongholds being recaptured. Many Japanese light and heavy machine guns, flat-trajectory guns, and other military supplies were seized. The Japanese troops stationed in the defense zone of this army were all歼灭annihilated.</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>After Roosevelt Accepts the Nomination</h3>
<p>The U.S. Democratic Party Convention, watched by the world, has endorsed Mr. Roosevelt with an absolute majority of 90 percent for a third term as president. Mr. Roosevelt subsequently broke his silence, maintained for more than a year, and accepted the nomination. This unprecedented move in the history of the American political system, breaking with tradition, was actually achieved in a way that the candidate did not directly engage in the campaign. This is certainly due to the special domestic and international situation in the United States today, but it also shows that Mr. Roosevelt's popularity and the people's yearning for him are beyond any precedent. Although a few people are still clinging to the dispute over historical precedent, and Mr. Roosevelt also said that serving the country depends on the final will of the national electorate, we firmly believe that as long as no major unexpected changes occur in the international situation, the rational and just American people will never destroy their own Great Wall and abandon this great leader with international prestige.</p>
<p>When Mr. Roosevelt first took power, the United States was still in the aftermath of the economic panic, with the people's livelihood withering and everything waiting to be rebuilt. Internationally, the roots of aggressive violence had already emerged, gradually and seriously threatening the world's order and tranquility. Mr. Roosevelt internally implemented the New Deal, seeking economic recovery through various social policies, and externally continued to support Stimson's non-recognition doctrine, constantly fighting against aggression. Although there were many internal and external constraints, the plans were often frustrated, and the actual achievements of the past eight years often failed to meet the ideals. The disasters of war and acts of aggression have swept across the East and West, causing more than half of the world's people to suffer great calamities, and posterity recalling the events cannot help but admire Mr. Roosevelt's foresight and the regret the missed opportunities caused by a few isolated and superficial views. Mr. Roosevelt's re-endorsement this time is enough to prove that the American people's admiration for Mr. Roosevelt has become more urgent as the world situation has deteriorated. However, whether he can learn from the past and give Mr. Roosevelt ample freedom to exercise his great ambitions is still a question to be decided. Recently, the U.S. government's foreign policy and the Democratic Party's recently announced foreign policy platform seem to have been temporarily passive due to the constraints of the election campaign. At the same time, the ambitious aggressors in the Far East are quite complacent, seeing this as an excellent opportunity for indulgence. Therefore, the three months from now until the U.S. election, as this newspaper pointed out a few days ago, is a major turning point in the international crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Roosevelt's radio address on the 18th of this month accepting the nomination was earnest and solemn, and compared with the statements issued by the heads of Britain and Germany in the past week, which only focused on their own current opportunities, it was even more meaningful and touched people deeply. Among them, the sentence "Neither justice nor efficiency can allow this great undertaking (defending the United States) to be entrusted to any party or any group," although it is a necessary statement, is also sufficient to show his frank and broad-mindedness. Originally, in any democratic country, party divisions may have differences, but national interests are the same. In peacetime, despite party affiliation, each has its own beliefs, but in serious times, it is never allowed to raise party prejudices above national interests. Mr. Roosevelt's previous appointment of Stimson and Knox to the cabinet was a prelude to the organization of a national cabinet. The similarities and differences between the Democratic and Republican party platforms in this election can also be seen that even in opposing political enemies, their political views do not have major differences. In the next three months, the U.S. government should take into account the seriousness of the world situation, continue to adhere to its consistent stance and beliefs, and resolutely engage in decisive measures to curb aggressive violence. The people should also give the authorities various conveniences, and not be constrained by the election relationship, inadvertently condoning international crimes, so that by the time the U.S. election is over, perhaps some parts of the world map will continue to change color, and the task of defending the United States will become even more difficult than ever before.</p>
<p>With Roosevelt's wisdom and intelligence, it is believed that he will never only focus on his personal gains and losses, thereby hindering the expression of his great ambitions. At this time when the choice between justice and force, the choice between morality and evil, and the choice between courageous action and erroneous appeasement policy are all reaching a critical juncture, how he decides and how he acts will naturally depend on the public will, but he cannot simply wait and put the imminent international crisis aside. In the past, Mr. Roosevelt has repeatedly made startling remarks and measures, and the impact has only made his position and prestige stronger. Even though it is currently the eve of the election, Mr. Roosevelt should not excessively cater to superficial and vulgar opinions and sit idly by as the aggressive atmosphere on the other side of the Pacific is soaring. A surprising wise measure may scare off the superficial and selfish, and its effect of clarifying the international crisis will certainly make supporters of Mr. Roosevelt even more supportive. Moreover, only by being more active and firm can the greatest achievements in the election be seen.</p>
<h3>U.S. Congress Temporarily Not Considering New Diplomatic Steps in the Far East; Roosevelt Has the Power to Respond Appropriately; American Newspapers Closely Monitor Japanese Political Situation and Shanghai Situation</h3>
<p>Washington: Congress is temporarily adjourned to allow members to attend the Democratic Party Convention. A few congressional leaders who stayed here last night told reporters that Congress has no intention this year to urge the United States to adopt a new policy in the Far East. According to sources in Congress, they do not believe that Congress will take any clear steps to confront Japan. The executive branch will not extend the congressional session to propose a new foreign policy. However, the Neutrality Act may be slightly amended to facilitate the government in providing convenience to British and French refugee children coming to the United States. Senator George said that the embargo bill against Japan will not be discussed this time, and the environment does not require it to be discussed at this time. Other congressional figures said that President Roosevelt has absolute legal authority to deal with Far Eastern events. President Roosevelt uses the Navy as his diplomatic tool, the State Department as his negotiating tool, and has the legal authority to implement an embargo when necessary on export passport agencies. Most of the members of Congress here are Republicans. They believe that no matter which party will not issue political documents related to the Far Eastern situation. However, if any announcement is made on this matter, they will firmly stand firm. Both parties may agree to allow the executive branch to regard the Far East as a purely diplomatic and non-political zone and adopt a subtle, firm, and orderly attitude. (United Press dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Washington: American newspapers are now publishing disturbing news from the Far East on the front page, occupying an important position along with news of the European war. This shows that Americans are increasingly concerned about the increasingly rampant arrogance of the Japanese in Shanghai and the developments that may be caused by the hard-line policy cabinet of the Konoe organization. The incident of Mr. Aponte, a Far East correspondent for the New York Times, being attacked by two armed Japanese men was detailed by newspapers here, along with a photo of the assaulted. The assassination of Zhang Sixu of the Greater American Evening News and the continued disputes between Japanese and American sailors have also attracted widespread attention. Public opinion is still criticizing Britain for closing the Burma Road. Yesterday, a newspaper published a cartoon depicting a British person and a Japanese officer shaking hands on a road with obstacles, and on the top of the obstacles was an umbrella, which is now a well-known symbol of appeasement. If the Japanese exert pressure, the American position will be even firmer. It remains to be seen to what extent President Roosevelt will be constrained by the Democratic Party's isolationist foreign policy. President Roosevelt's previous policy of making all American material resources available to the Allied countries seems to have retreated. The methods Roosevelt used to win his nomination for a third term as president have aroused considerable criticism from both friends and foes. Therefore, before he can restore his strength to defeat his Republican political enemy Wilkie in November, Roosevelt's policies will likely adopt a stable and moderate approach. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, all Chinese newspapers here published Hitler's speech to the Reichstag in large characters and believe that Britain seems unable to accept the German proposal for peace. The attention of the Chinese side is still focused on the future battles between Britain and Germany and the results of the U.S. presidential election. Chinese observers believe that there is not much difference between the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States regarding foreign policy. The only difference is that the Republican Party opposes the United States participating in the European war, while the Democratic Party is the opposite. As for the United States' opposition to Japanese aggression in China, it was first initiated by the Republican government and is now being continued by the Democrats. Therefore, no matter what the outcome of this presidential election, the U.S. Far Eastern policy will definitely not change. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Opinions in the British Cabinet on Closing the Burma Road Differ; Some Cabinet Members Oppose Showing Weakness to Japan; China Is Considering Importing Goods from the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Madrid: According to news received here from London, the disagreement within the British cabinet regarding the transport of munitions to China through Burma has become apparent. For example, Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Aircraft Production, does not approve of Britain acceding to Japan's demands. In addition, several other ministers also hold this view. Mr. Beaverbrook's newspaper, the Daily Express, said that Japan wants to insult Britain and provoke anger without resorting to war during China's war of resistance. Britain is now very strong and there is no need to show weakness to Japan. We must consult with the United States before making a decision. The United States will lose more from Japanese aggression than we will. A number of Liberal and Labour members of the cabinet also oppose taking a peaceful policy toward Japan. Their policies can be represented by the views expressed by Mr. Brailsford in the Chronicle. Mr. Brailsford said that Britain's surrender to Japan only shows Britain's weakness. The Foreign Office's failure to respond to Russia's views on the difficulties in the Far East is a mistake. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Chongqing: With the Burma Road now closed, cutting off Chongqing's access to the sea, the Chinese authorities are now taking active steps to place the Chinese economy on a new foundation. Government officials are now considering the problem of obtaining supplies from the Soviet Union to Sichuan by land to compensate for the loss of assistance from Western countries. Newspapers have published government officials' statements reiterating the Chinese determination to resist Japan. According to reliable sources, the long-standing discord between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has been resolved. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>New York: The New York Post commented on Churchill's remarks regarding the Burma Road agreement, saying that while the Prime Minister's wording was very cautious, it clearly indicated that the British government did not like this agreement, which is the same fact as the Chinese government. The Prime Minister's words contained the implication that three months later, if the situation improves, the British government will never allow Japan to replay this drama. The Chinese claim to be annoyed by this agreement, but we know that this is not the case. The Chinese are familiar with the technique of delaying matters by talking more and conceding less. Therefore, while the Chinese lamented the conclusion of this agreement, they secretly congratulated themselves that Britain had not made many concessions, and prayed that British fleet would enter the Singapore base three months later. If the Japanese did not learn from the Prime Minister's remarks that what the Japanese had imposed on Britain would be repaid with interest at the earliest opportunity, then the Japanese still need to learn the subtle nuances of the English language. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>London: An Observer diplomatic correspondent said that the Soviet Union's cooperation with Britain is more concerned about the Far East than about Europe. Therefore, Moscow openly expressed regret over the recent conclusion of the Anglo-Japanese agreement, and was even more surprised because Britain not only did not consult with the Soviet Union on this matter, but even did not formally notify the Soviet Union. Therefore, Moscow felt even more regret. It is now hoped that a kind of contact will still be made between London and Moscow. This is now very likely to be realized, because the British government has already stated that the Burma agreement is temporary, and the final solution will be fully participated by China, Japan, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

<h3>Burma Brews Independence Movement</h3>
<p>The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao recently reported that the Burmese Freedom Party held a convention in Yangon on July 7th, resulting in the launch of an independence movement. Leaders of the Burmese Freedom Party, as well as students and workers who participated in the convention, have issued a declaration stating that since the British government has declared that maintaining the independence and freedom of small and weak countries is one of the goals of this anti-German war, it should grant the Burmese independence and freedom and allow the Burmese to organize a government. However, Britain has not given the Burmese independence and freedom, but has instead arrested the leaders of the Burmese Freedom Party and confiscated the party's publications. The declaration also stated that if Britain wants to gain the sympathy of the Burmese, it must release the arrested Burmese people. (United Press dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Hong Kong According to the local "Sunday Post," three Americans, Mr. Seiffert, Mrs. Seiffert, and Mrs. Seiffert's brother, Mr. Battison, left Hong Kong for San Francisco on a two-masted ship on June 24th. They have now been arrested by the Japanese authorities in Taipei, Taiwan. It is believed that the three were arrested because they entered a defense zone without permission. It is also heard that the Japanese authorities have confiscated the ship the three were on. The American consulate here said that they only knew that a two-masted ship had left Hong Kong last month, but had not heard of the arrest of the three Americans.

<h3>Axis Powers Launch Peace Offensive Awaiting Britain's Formal Reply Rumors of Three Conflicting Opinions Within Britain Roman Newspaper Advises America Not to Interfere in European Affairs</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden According to reports from London today, Lloyd George recently requested the House of Commons to hold a closed-door meeting to discuss Hitler's speech in the Reichstag the night before. Lloyd George also requested an audience with the King to make a statement. Since Hitler's speech, three opinions have become prevalent in Britain: (1) Churchill and others advocate ignoring Hitler's speech; (2) advocate exploring the Axis powers' peace terms; (3) representative of the people's desire for peace. (Haitong Telegraph on the 21st)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden The British Broadcasting Corporation last night broadcast the following statement in German, responding to the peace proposal of Führer Hitler: "We reject your appeal. Our common sense, our national strength, our sense of honor and justice, and our responsibility to the world all require us to continue to fight for freedom with all our might, because this freedom is what you want to destroy." (Haitong Telegraph on the 21st)</p>
<p>Rome Yesterday's political news indicated that Italy is preparing to launch a major offensive against Britain in the Mediterranean. Italy may join forces with Spain to attack Gibraltar. Authoritative sources believe that Chancellor Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini are now awaiting Britain's response to Hitler's "appeal." Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, wrote in "The Italian Daily" that Italy's attack on the British Empire and Germany's plan to invade Britain will proceed simultaneously. Gayda praised Chancellor Hitler's speech to the German Parliament on Thursday and stated that Italy is currently responsible for restraining the British Navy, so that the British Navy cannot fully defend England when Germany invades. This war is against imperialists who want to control both Europe and the Americas. Gayda advised the American countries that are about to attend the Pan-Pacific Conference to unite with each other based on military mutual assistance agreements in order to eliminate the fear of aggression from Europe. However, "the Axis countries have no intention now or in the future to interfere in the Western Hemisphere, and at the same time we must declare that we do not want the American countries to interfere in European affairs." The United States must abandon its isolationist program and must declare practical neutrality and a determination to oppose any interference from non-American countries. They guarantee that they can achieve the only goal of the American countries, namely self-defense. (United Press dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Rome Regarding the comments on Hitler's speech, the evening newspapers published it first last night. The newspaper editorials paid particular attention to the points about Italy in the speech. The evening newspapers carried headlines about the German Air Force's new attacks on Britain and Italy's efforts to fight. The newspapers all agreed that if Britain does not surrender, the war will inevitably continue. They paid particular attention to Hitler's claim of the Axis powers' strength and sufficient war preparations, and the enemy's dream of war with Russia. The Tribune stated that Hitler's call for peace to Britain was not to present a new ultimatum, but to fulfill his responsibilities and appeal to world opinion. Gayda said that although the rulers of London can still shout loudly, they are concealing the facts and do not know what the outcome will be. This war is not against the Anglo-Saxon nation, but a war of noble culture against backward political factions. The general opinion is that if Britain does not change its attitude, the war will eventually continue and become more intense. (Haitong Telegraph on the 21st)</p>
<p>Hitler and Mussolini Exchange Telegrams The Two Countries Advance Hand in Hand</p>
<p>Berlin Mussolini sent the following telegram to Hitler today: "The words you delivered in the German Parliament have deeply resonated in the hearts of the Italian people. I thank you and reiterate my previous promise that the Italian people will advance together with the German people, no matter what happens, and will always cooperate until victory is in hand." Hitler replied: "Your telegram is sincere and deeply moving. Fascist Italy and National Socialist Germany will advance together and achieve final victory together, winning freedom for the people of both countries." (Haitong Telegraph on the 21st)</p>
<p>One Hundred British and German Aircraft Fierce Battle in the Skies Over the English Channel</p>
<p>London Approximately one hundred British and German aircraft engaged in a major battle over the sea in southeastern England again yesterday. They could be seen tumbling up and down, which was dazzling. Since the German aircraft carried out extensive bombings of the British Isles, this day seemed to be one of the most tense. The German Stuka bomber fleet, escorted by fighter jets, flew to the coast of England to provoke a battle. First, they launched a surprise attack on the British escort ships in the English Channel. Bombs fell around the ships, but none hit. The British anti-aircraft artillery immediately drove back the German aircraft. The British ships suffered no losses. Later, the German fighter jets encountered the British Air Force, and a large-scale air battle immediately broke out. The battle did not stop until dusk. The British claimed victory, saying that ten enemy aircraft were shot down and only two British aircraft were lost. It was also heard that the first statistics of civilian casualties were announced yesterday. It is said that since the German aircraft began bombing Britain on June 18, 336 non-combatants have died and 476 have been seriously injured. According to official reports, a total of 130 German aircraft have been destroyed during this period, and approximately 40 to 50 other enemy aircraft have been destroyed. Officials said that the German air raid on Britain yesterday seemed to be due to Britain's lack of a favorable response to Hitler's peace proposals. Officials are now silently dismissing Hitler's claim that he will win the war. (International News Agency dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>British Aircraft Night Raid on German Territory Fierce Bombing of Military Targets</p>
<p>London The British Air Ministry announced last night that British bombers attacked seaplane bases along the northwest coast of Germany and the northern coast of the Netherlands last night, and bombed aircraft factories in Wismar and other places along the Baltic coast, oil factories in Bremen and other places, and the railway transportation on the border between Germany and the Netherlands. British bombers engaged enemy aircraft, and two German fighter jets were severely damaged. Aircraft from the British Coastal Command also attacked the Emden naval base and the port of Harlingen in the Netherlands at night. Three British aircraft were lost. Two more enemy aircraft were shot down by British fighter jets yesterday, bringing the total to four. According to a communiqué issued by the Air Ministry's Intelligence Office, British bombers again attacked the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory in Bremen last night, bombing it in batches for more than ninety minutes. The factory buildings and the adjacent airfield were all hit by high-explosive bombs. The Dornier seaplane factory in Wismar was bombed, and the runways and other places were ablaze. The Dornier aircraft factory in Wiesensand and the Wilhelmshaven dockyard were also bombed and severely damaged. Although the British aircraft encountered heavy anti-aircraft fire and barrage balloons, they overcame the difficulties and attacked the docks, etc. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Berlin This afternoon's German military report stated that yesterday and last night, German fighter jets attacked airfields, seaports, and gasoline depots in central and southern England, and bombed industrial institutions near Newcastle. The explosions where the bombs fell were deafening. A cruiser and two destroyers in the British escort fleet were hit by German aircraft and suffered heavy damage. German aircraft and British aircraft engaged in fierce battles over the English Channel. German aircraft shot down eight British aircraft, and another British aircraft was destroyed near Rotterdam.

<h3>Hitler's Speech Elicits Reactions in British Colonies Believed to be Extravagant Talk of Peace Lacking Sincerity Various Parties Donate to British War Fund</h3>
<p>London It has been learned that all parts of the British Empire have reacted negatively to the speech delivered by German Führer Hitler yesterday. For example, Australian Federal Prime Minister Menzies recently gave a broadcast speech from Sydney, saying, "Hitler has again talked extravagantly about peace. Peace is indeed welcome to every rational person, but the peace we want to achieve must be able to give freedom and security to the whole world. In short, peace should be based on our terms, not on those proposed by Hitler. In addition, the Montreal Daily Star in the Canadian Federation also reported that the only response of the world to Hitler's speech is to scoff at it. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>London All India Radio broadcast yesterday that "all India considers Hitler's peace offensive to be a worthless gesture." The "Times of India" said, "Hitler's peace talks are clearly insincere, and no one can be deceived." The "Hindustan Times" of Delhi said, "Hitler appeals to Britain's common sense and reason, but his speech lacks both common sense and reason." The "Tribune" of Lahore believes that this speech will make Britain's determination to fight to the end even more firm. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3>British Aircraft Production Exceeds Germany Quality is Also Superior</h3>
<p>London According to the Sunday Times air force reporter, Britain's current aircraft production has exceeded Germany's monthly production of 1,800 aircraft. The reporter also said that Germany's first-line air force strength is estimated at 18,000 aircraft, which is still above Britain, but there is reason to believe that Germany lacks trained aircrew to fly the aircraft it has produced. As for the quality of the aircraft produced by Britain, it is completely superior to German aircraft in combat. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Comparison of British and Italian Naval Strength</h3>
<p>Berlin According to a naval report released by Rear Admiral Bufeifei, a special correspondent of the Haitong News Agency, in the past week, since the naval battle between Britain and Italy off Cape Spartivento in the Mediterranean on July 9, the Italian Navy has shattered the British plan and achieved a great victory. The naval strength in the Mediterranean has changed compared to before. Previously, it was Britain and France against Italy, but now that France has withdrawn, Italy is in a superior position. Britain currently has a fleet of seven capital ships, two aircraft carriers, ten heavy cruisers, and a total of seventy light cruisers and destroyers in the Mediterranean, as well as fifteen submarines. Italy has two 35,000-ton capital ships, four converted capital ships, seven heavy cruisers, twelve light cruisers, twelve torpedo cruisers, fifty-four destroyers, thirty-two torpedo boats, and one hundred submarines. Therefore, Italy's strength in the central Mediterranean today is clearly above Britain's. (Haitong Telegraph on the 21st)</p>
<h3>British Navy Announces Circumstances of Sinking of Italian Ship More Than 500 Officers and Men Rescued Another Cruiser Hit and Injured</h3>
<p>Cairo The British fleet commander in the Mediterranean recently issued a communiqué reviewing the sinking of the Italian cruiser "Colleoni," stating that the ship and a cruiser of the same class were spotted by a British destroyer northwest of Crete at approximately 7:30 am on June 19. About an hour later, the Australian cruiser "Sydney" arrived to assist in the battle. The Italian ship turned its head to the southwest to escape, but the British fleet was determined to attack. The "Sydney's" firepower was accurate, and the "Colleoni" was hit, reducing its speed. The British destroyer was able to completely destroy the ship. The second Italian cruiser was chased by the British ship and was also seen to be hit, but its speed was higher and it was able to escape. The British fleet rescued no less than 545 officers and men of the "Colleoni," including the captain. When the British ships were engaged in this humanitarian work and returning, they were bombed several times by the Italian Air Force, but there were no casualties. After returning to port, the fleet in the port vied to welcome them. (Reuters dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>Rome Regarding the sinking of the Italian light cruiser "Colleoni," the Italian Navy stated yesterday that Italian ships were inferior to British ships in terms of armor and gun positions. The Cini-class ships have eight 15.2 cm caliber guns and ten 10 cm caliber guns. Although the "Colleoni" also has eight 15.2 cm guns, it only has eight 10 cm guns, and its displacement is also 2,000 tons less than British ships. This is because the British ships have thicker armor, which is an advantage. The Italian ships took the initiative to attack in order to carry out their mission, but they sacrificed themselves due to their thinner armor. (Haitong Telegraph on the 21st)</p>
<h3>British Excavating Trenches in Gibraltar</h3>

<h3>The Three Baltic States Prepare to Merge with the Soviet Union: New National Assemblies of the Three States Meet to Decide on This</h3>
<p>Moscow: News from the Baltic states indicates that the new national assemblies of the three states are meeting today to decide on the merger of their respective countries with the Soviet Union. Moscow newspapers have given prominent coverage to this news, reprinting lengthy reports and feature articles from Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia, all expressing the desire of these three countries to merge. The national assemblies of the three states will meet at noon today. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3>Soviet Influence Spreads; Italy Watches Closely; Unease Especially Felt at British-Soviet Rapprochement; Improved Soviet-Turkish Relations</h3>
<p>New York: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano held another secret meeting with Führer Hitler in Berlin. At the same time, Italian newspapers issued warnings to Stalin, stating that if the Soviet government accepts suggestions for compromise and cooperation with Britain, the Soviet Union will share the fate of Poland. German and Italian newspapers have generally been cautious in their language regarding the Soviet Union's wartime preparations. Now, Italian Fascist newspapers are openly expressing suspicion of Soviet perfidy, implicitly conveying Mussolini's concern about the dangerous development of the Slavic situation. Ciano met with Hitler once earlier this month. The fact that Ciano returned to Berlin for another meeting with Hitler so soon afterwards is seen as extremely significant. Italy's suspicion of the Soviet Union is deeper than Germany's, as Mussolini has vital interests in the Balkans and the Mediterranean. At the same time, Germany is undoubtedly very concerned about the large-scale pro-Soviet plebiscites held in Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania this week. The result of these plebiscites will give Stalin complete control over the armed forces of the three Baltic states. The Soviet army has freed itself from France's encirclement of Germany, but a new encirclement of Yugoslavia is gradually strengthening. The Soviet Union's gains in Finland and the Balkans give it control of the Eastern Baltic Sea, its control over Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, the occupation of part of Poland and the Bukovina and Bessarabia provinces of Romania, give the Soviet Union a border stretching nearly a thousand miles with Germany. At the same time, the Soviet Union is not only pressuring Turkey to jointly control the Dardanelles Strait, but also attempting to use its favorable position in Bessarabia to stir up new waves of communism in the Eastern Balkans. Due to these developments, which are contrary to German and Italian interests, Italian newspapers are showing their alarm at the Soviet Union, fearing that the Soviet Union and Britain will form some kind of cooperation. The British government says that the severing of the Burma Road is related to the settlement of the Asian war between China and Japan. Britain may have the opportunity to cooperate with the Soviet Union in the East, and thus form a mutual assistance pact for their joint efforts in Europe. All these things contribute to the complexity of European diplomacy. The Soviet Union has now become a mystery for Germany and Italy in the European war. Both Hitler and Mussolini are watching Stalin closely and making uneasy estimates of Stalin's next ambitious move. At a time when Germany and Italy are planning to launch a major attack on Britain, both countries are particularly concerned about the Soviet Union. It is widely rumored in Europe that the German High Command lacks a consensus on the consequences of invading Britain. It is also heard that some of Hitler's generals have advised that an attack on Britain is bound to fail. If, at the same time, the Soviet Union seeks further territorial expansion, the overall situation of the war will immediately change. The instability of the war situation is truly unparalleled in today's European landscape. (United Press Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>New York: New York Times' Luo Jing correspondent Du Lin di discussed Romanian public opinion, saying that the Germans are now doing their utmost to promote conflicts between the Soviet Union and Romania, the Soviet Union and Turkey, and Turkey and Romania. Such as the Soviet Union's intention to send troops across the Prut River to reach the northern oilfields of Romania, and the Soviet Union's delivery of an ultimatum to Turkey, demanding key Turkish territories such as Kars and Ardahan, and requesting revisions to the Dardanelles Strait, these news all came from the German side, used to alienate Soviet-Romanian and Soviet-Turkish relations. People like Luo Jing, with shallow understanding, do not know the German intentions, and spread this kind of news abroad, thus creating a great stir. There is also one thing that is more concrete, but not very widely publicized, that is, the eastward advance of the German army and the westward movement of the large Soviet army. In terms of Soviet-Romanian relations, there is indeed progress now rather than deterioration. The Soviet Union can probably make some concessions to Romania rather than making demands. The reporter heard from the most reliable sources that the Turkish government is determined not to be used by Germany and knows the German army's ambition to advance eastward, and the process of threatening Turkish independence, is perhaps clearer than what the Soviet Union sees. Romanians have not forgotten the past hardships and are now wondering whether it is easier for the Germans to conquer Britain than it was for Napoleon, and whether the Germans will not repeat Napoleon's mistakes. Napoleon failed in Britain and then led his army east to Moscow. Will this historical event be repeated today? A month ago, the Germans boasted that before and after July 15, the swastika flag would fly over Buckingham Palace. Now this boast has changed into Hitler's plea for peace. However, this development does not change the fact that the German and Soviet armies are advancing, nor does it change the Soviet Union's fear, stemming from the evil seeds it sowed itself last August, that it may reap bitter fruit in the future.

<h3>Britain and the United States Establish Agreement Regarding the Supply of Defense Materials</h3>
<p>London: According to the details of the two agreements announced recently, the United States will be able to obtain stockpiles of tin and rubber for defense purposes. The agreement with the International Tin Committee stipulates that the United States Reconstruction Finance Corporation will purchase all available tin production under the standard production and export quota (recently increased to 130 percent), for a period of twelve months. The purchase price will be US$0.50 per pound. This tin production may be transferred to the US government in the event of a national emergency. This agreement may be terminated when the tin stockpile has accumulated to no less than 75,000 tons. After the expiration of a three-year period starting from January 1, 1941, the corporation will have the right to liquidate the tin stockpile, but it must notify the committee in writing and agree that the amount liquidated in any three-month period shall not exceed 5 percent of the stockpile. As for the agreement signed with the International Rubber Committee, it stipulates that a stockpile of 100,000 to 150,000 tons will be purchased at a price of US$0.18 to US$0.20 per pound, to be shipped to the United States before the end of this year. The committee has agreed to encourage producers to sell at the above-mentioned price. After December 31, 1943, the inventory will be liquidated, but not more than 100,000 tons per year, so as not to affect the world market price. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Signs "Two-Ocean" Navy Bill; US Navy Expected to Have 701 Warships by 1947</h3>
<p>Washington: The "Two-Ocean Navy Bill" was signed into law by President Roosevelt yesterday. The bill stipulates a seven-year navy expansion program to build a fleet that is larger than any other navy in the world in terms of range and striking power, so that the United States can simultaneously fight in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, 1,000 miles off both coasts, if necessary. By 1947, the US Navy is expected to have 701 warships, including 35 battleships, 20 aircraft carriers, 88 cruisers, 378 destroyers, and 180 submarines. It is estimated that the construction and maintenance costs of the fleet in the next seven years will require 200 million yuan per year, and the maintenance costs thereafter will require 180 million yuan per year. (Reuters Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Washington: Since US President Roosevelt signed the naval expansion bill yesterday, the United States has begun building a two-ocean fleet, whose strength will exceed the combined strength of Japan, Italy, Germany, and the Soviet Union. It is expected to be completed in 1946, giving the US Navy 701 warships (including 35 battleships, 20 aircraft carriers, 88 cruisers, 378 destroyers, and 180 submarines). At the same time, naval aircraft will also increase from 4,000 to 15,000. (United Press Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Pan-American Conference Opens Yesterday</h3>

It is heard that the agenda can be divided into three parts: (1) Matters concerning neutrality, such as reviewing the recommendations of the Pan-American Standing Neutrality Committee, reviewing the principles of the Panama Declaration, and discussing charitable issues arising from the war (such as refugee issues and Red Cross activities, etc.); (2) Safeguarding peace in the Western Hemisphere, such as investigating colonies owned by non-American countries in the Western Hemisphere, and reviewing methods that can promote the efficiency of the resolutions in the Panama Declaration; (3) Economic cooperation, such as reviewing the recommendations of the Pan-American Economic and Financial Committee, etc. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Submits Three Wishes to Konoe, Advocating Changes in Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo: After Konoe received the imperial order to form a cabinet, he repeatedly negotiated with the heads of the military. It is said that the main issues discussed by both sides were how to quickly end the "China Incident" in accordance with the principles announced by Konoe on December 22, 1938. According to the Miyako Shimbun, which is known for its well-informed sources, the army authorities submitted three wishes to Konoe: (1) to establish a new political structure in the country; (2) to organize a supreme national defense agency; and (3) to change Japan's current foreign policy. In short, after the formation of the new Konoe cabinet, it will maintain close contact with the army headquarters, so that the views of the military and the government can be brought closer. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun also published an editorial, stating that on the day the new cabinet is established, a new agency may need to be specially established to engage in coordination between civil and military affairs. This agency should be organized by the Prime Minister and the leaders of the army and navy. If its scope is considered too narrow, it may be replaced by a National Defense Committee jointly organized by the Prime Minister and the ministers of the army, navy, finance, and foreign affairs. In any case, Konoe's appointment as prime minister is the best way to prevent friction within the government due to domestic or international issues. In addition, although people in the business community have some hesitation about the so-called new political structure of the future, most also believe that without Konoe's assumption of office, it would be impossible to stabilize the domestic political situation. The Japan Times focused on the international situation, reporting that Konoe, at the beginning of his mandate, would reconsider Japan's "non-intervention policy" towards the current European war with all parties concerned, and even raise for discussion the two issues of expanding the prime minister's authority and strengthening Japan's relations with Germany and Italy. However, the main issue is how to eliminate friction between the government and the military. In short, Japanese newspapers now unanimously believe that any cabinet that does not obtain the active support and full understanding of the army and navy will be difficult to be strong and effective. (Havas Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>The Political Views of the New Army Minister Tojo</p>
<p>Tokyo: The unwritten law of successive cabinet formations in Japan is that a "weak" prime minister must be assisted by a moderate and compromising army minister, while a "strong" prime minister must be paired with a strong army representative to achieve balance. This time, Konoe's cabinet formation has not been able to surpass this convention. The position of army minister has already been decided to be held by Lieutenant General Tojo, a shrewd and decisive man, known as "the Razor," and truly the most dynamic figure in the Japanese army. Tojo is 56 years old this year, a strong figure among the younger generation of generals. The army headquarters believes that action is more important than words at this time. Tojo has a "youthful character," and it seems more appropriate to appoint him as army minister than other predecessors. Moreover, this person is the son of a general (his father, Lieutenant General Tojo, was a famous military strategist during the Meiji era). He has served as Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Decision Officer of the Ministry of the Army, Director of Aviation, and participated in the Sino-Japanese War. On August 22, 1937, he led his troops to occupy Zhangjiakou, and on October 14 of the same year, he occupied Baotou. He agrees with the Kwantung Army Commander Umezu and the former Army Minister Sugiyama on the two points that Japan must end the "China Incident" as soon as possible and that "Japan's prestige should be expanded to the South Seas."

<h3>Dutch East Indies Authorities Improve Treatment of German Nationals; German Criminal Law Implemented in the Netherlands</h3>
<p>London: Here, a Dutch person denies the allegation that the Dutch East Indies authorities are mistreating Germans, saying that according to the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies' report, the material and health conditions of the captured Germans are very satisfactory, and prayer meetings, lectures, concerts, and theatrical troupes are also being organized. The captured people have now been moved to new reception centers, where the entertainment facilities are even better than before.

<h3>Someone Attempts to Steal US Secret Weapons; State Judges Hold Conference to Discuss Strict Enforcement of National Defense Law</h3>
<p>Washington: Someone is attempting to steal the US secret invention, the "bomb aiming device." Therefore, the Department of Justice yesterday summoned 200 state judges to come here for a meeting to discuss the strict enforcement of the National Defense Law. Attorney General Jackson said that the meeting is scheduled for August 5-6, and the most urgent plans will be presented at the meeting.

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Analyzes Reasons for Cabinet Change in Japan; Attempts to End War Against China and Rapid Development Towards the Pacific</h3>
<p>Moscow: Regarding the resignation of the Yonai Cabinet, the Izvestia commented, "The resignation of the Yonai Cabinet occurred a few days after the third anniversary of the Sino-Japanese War. Undoubtedly, the Yonai Cabinet's departure is the overall result of Japan's military actions. In the past war process, although Japan had attempts to end the war, none were as urgent as in the recent two or three months. The main factor belongs to foreign policy, because the Japanese political aspect believes that the current international situation is most favorable for Japan's development in the southern and southwestern Pacific. In terms of domestic conditions, Japan also urgently needs to end the China Incident. The three years of war have artificially shaken Japan's economic structure, and the food problem has become more difficult. This difficulty is not only seen in Japan, but also felt in Korea and Manchuria. At the same time, the lack of raw materials has also become very acute. The gold reserves of the Bank of Japan are almost exhausted, and the national debt has reached 24,000,000,000 yuan. All these are the difficulties encountered by the Japanese government. The main task of the Konoe Cabinet is to solve these difficulties. The Japanese ruling class now hopes that Konoe can overcome the difficulties in a more 'resolute' and more 'effective' way." (TASS Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Moscow: Today, the newspapers here have published comments on the change of the Japanese cabinet and the formation of the Konoe Fumimaro cabinet. The Pravda claimed that this Japanese cabinet turmoil was caused by the military's dissatisfaction with the Yonai cabinet's foreign policy. Japanese soldiers, in view of the changes in the international situation and the recent dramatic changes in the European war, have ambitious plans to expand southward. Therefore, they have recently put forward slogans such as "putting the national system completely under wartime conditions" and "building a new order in East Asia, China, 'Manchuria,' and the South Seas." The domestic slogan is "one-party politics," in other words, establishing a dictatorship. The Japanese military is afraid that long nights bring bad dreams, and there will be changes along the way, so they urged Yonai to resign. Therefore, all the domestic and foreign affairs of the Konoe cabinet will represent the opinions of the military, and Japan's foreign and domestic policies will undergo important changes due to Konoe's rise to power.

<h3>US Ambassador to France Flies to New York; Does Not Plan to Return</h3>
<p>New York: US Ambassador to France Bullitt arrived here yesterday on a clipper from Lisbon, Portugal. Bullitt told reporters that Germany has severed all secret diplomatic relations between France and the United States, so he had to return to the United States in person to report to President Roosevelt. (International News Service Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>New York: Former Austrian Empress Zita, along with her daughter Elizabeth and US Ambassador to France Bullitt, flew to the United States from Lisbon on a clipper and arrived here yesterday. When asked about the outcome of the European war, the former Austrian empress replied, "Of course, I hope the democratic countries will win." Bullitt said that when he stayed in Paris and met the German occupying forces, he was treated well by the Germans, and said that at that time, although the French suffered a terrible defeat, they were still determined to continue resisting. "I hope everyone recognizes that the French people still retain their former greatness." Bullitt then mentioned the new all-powerful government of France and told reporters, "I left France on the day the new French government was established. I have not heard any comments from the French people about the new government." Bullitt estimated that the total number of French and Belgian refugees in France is 10.5 million. Bullitt said that the refugee problem is one of the biggest problems in France. Railways have been suspended due to the bombing of bridges, and gasoline is also extremely scarce. As a result, some parts of France have plenty of food, while other parts have a severe shortage of food. Some places have even formed terrible situations. The transportation of food is a very important issue. Premier Pétain is highly respected by the French people. Although he is old, he can quickly restore order from chaos. There is absolutely no revolution or unrest in France. (United Press Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>New York: After US Ambassador to France Bullitt arrived here yesterday on a clipper, he went to Hyde Park to meet President Roosevelt and report on the European situation. Bullitt told reporters that he did not believe he would return to his post in Paris. (Haitong Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>French Newspaper Editor Sentenced to Imprisonment by Germans</h3>
<p>London: According to a German radio station, Durn, the editor of the Echo du Nord newspaper in Lille, France, has recently been sentenced to five years of imprisonment by a German military court. It is said that Durn attempted to publish the full text of the armistice conditions before the Pétain government announced the armistice conditions, and disregarded the warnings of German inspectors, published text that implied the content of the armistice conditions, attempted to publish a photograph of Churchill, and published photographs of French spies who were shot by the Germans in the last war, actively inciting the French to engage in passive resistance.

<h3>Passionate American Support for China, Optimistic About the Future of Resistance, Over 50,000 Letters Sent Calling for an Embargo Against Japan, American Government and Public Unanimously Support China, Report from a Representative of the American Western Youth Association</h3>
<p>China's heroic resistance against Japan for the past three years is not only for the liberation of this ancient Eastern country, but also fulfills a great and profound obligation to all people of justice and humanity worldwide, and will be one of the most brilliant chapters in human history. Therefore, all true peace-loving people around the world have given their highest sympathy and wholeheartedly support it. In particular, the American people, who pursue freedom more than hunger and thirst, have been constantly providing material assistance for three years. This kind of enthusiastic action is not so much about the material benefits to China, but about the spiritual encouragement. As the saying goes, "Sincerity can penetrate metal and stone." China's arduous and outstanding resistance has the significance of inspiring the world and creating a new page in history. Recently, Mr. Howard D. Willits, the national secretary of the American Pacific Northwest Student Christian Association, sent a letter to a Mr. So-and-so of the International Friendship Committee of the Christian Student Group Federation in this city, detailing the sympathy of the American people for China's resistance against Japan and their enthusiastic support for China. This shows the direction of people's hearts and further increases the confidence of the Chinese people in fighting.</p>
<p>Embargo Against Japan Will Take Effect Immediately</p>
<p>According to the intentions of the Geneva World Student Service Society, the American Pacific Northwest Student Association has a regular fundraising and relief campaign for poor Chinese students every semester. In his letter, Mr. Willits first stated that the association has completed its fundraising work for poor Chinese students in the four states of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana, and the total amount has exceeded US$2,000, which will be remitted to China soon. In addition, what was reported was mostly about the American people's support for China. Mr. Willits' letter stated, "Some reporters here said that the changing situation in the European war has prompted Japan to take advantage of the situation in China, threatening and coercing, and has gained some benefits. However, we all hope that this news is not accurate. In any case, we do not believe that violence can guarantee lasting peace. Today, the arrogance of Japan, Germany, and Italy is undoubtedly due to the appeasement of Britain, France, and the United States, which has led to this. However, how can the ambition of the so-called 'omnipotent country' be curbed by appeasement? Therefore, our efforts must be to eliminate the formation of war by all means. Therefore, some people have recently launched a communication campaign. All those who love justice and peace must write to various government agencies and important figures in the United States, requesting the American government and the public to implement an embargo on Japan for all military supplies and raw materials. More than 50,000 letters have already been sent, and we firmly believe that there will be a very good response in the near future."</p>
<p>Generous Donations, Unanimous Support</p>
<p>In his letter, Mr. Willits continued to describe the general life of the American people, saying, "The high expansion of capitalism, coupled with the worldwide turmoil and the rampant war, has affected the lives of the American people. The depression formed by countless young men and women due to the bread problem cannot be immediately overcome by the New Economic Policy. The American people, although far away in the west of the earth, are also sharing the suffering of this turbulent era. However, in general, they all give great sympathy to China's resistance against Japan, even under their increasingly heavy living burden, and do their best to help China with generous donations. This is enough to express the noble spirit of the American people, their love for truth, and their hatred for evil, and their confidence in China's victory in the war and the success of nation-building is no different from that of the Chinese people themselves." It is also heard that the international youth student correspondence movement initiated by the Christian Student Group Federation in this city has its main purpose to win international sympathy for China's resistance against Japan. This movement has been promoted for two years and has achieved very good results. The scope of communication covers the entire globe. All young students who are enthusiastic and loyal to their country can apply to participate at any time.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Passenger Transport Unimpeded, Inland Export Goods Can Still Be Declared and Shipped</h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s ship "Taishing" arrived in Shanghai from Haiphong at about 1:00 PM yesterday, carrying more than 400 passengers. According to a passenger who told the "Pingming News" reporter, regarding the recent traffic situation of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, since the French authorities complied with the Japanese request and closed the freight transport of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway from July 1st, passenger transport is still unimpeded. However, ordinary goods passing through Vietnam to Kunming have also been temporarily suspended. Chinese inland export goods transported from Kunming through Vietnam to Shanghai and Hong Kong that have already completed export procedures can still be shipped as usual. Those that have not completed the procedures can also be declared and shipped as usual.</p>
<h3>National Government Concerned About Rice Prices in Shanghai, Planning to Stabilize Prices, Speculative Rice Merchants Still Engaging in Private Transactions, Price Evaluation Committee Determined to Eliminate Them as Originally Planned</h3>
<p>The food supply in Shanghai is being held by speculators, causing fluctuations in the prices of japonica and indica rice, seriously threatening ordinary people. After consultation between the authorities of the two concessions, concrete measures were taken to stabilize the rice market, and the relevant rice industry groups were ordered to inform their colleagues to implement them as scheduled. A reporter from the "Xin Sheng News" learned from relevant sources yesterday that the National Government authorities are very concerned about the overall food supply in Shanghai and will order the relevant groups in the city to assist the rice industry in jointly preventing rice shortages, purchasing and storing large amounts of rice in Shanghai, restricting rice market trade, and encouraging merchants to purchase large quantities from various producing areas. At the same time, the rice industry will be notified to do its best to stabilize the rice market and take the overall situation into consideration.</p>
<p>Undermining Evaluation</p>
<p>The Rice Price Evaluation Committee has held three meetings to evaluate and determine the maximum prices for foreign rice transactions in the market. However, the general speculative rice merchants have turned a deaf ear to the officially set prices, still being active in the market, stirring up trouble, and engaging in private transactions, so that the prices of various grades of rice are uneven, or even exceed the evaluated prices. It is now learned that the Rice Price Evaluation Committee is determined to maintain its original intention, find ways to balance rice prices, eliminate non-industry speculators, and stop roundabout transactions in order to stabilize the overall food supply in Shanghai. It will encourage reporting and whistleblowing. Once discovered, it will be reported to the authorities of the two concessions for severe punishment. Therefore, once rice prices are evaluated and announced, they must be strictly observed. Market transactions are only allowed below the evaluated prices and must not exceed the limits.</p>
<p>Smooth Sale of Broken Rice</p>
<p>The fourth phase of the sale of broken rice at a fair price has been very good in recent days. Although the number of people buying rice at a fair price is not as crowded as before, the total amount of rice sold daily is still more than 1,000 bags. It is now learned that the 40,000 bags of broken rice ordered by the association from abroad have already been shipped from the place of origin and are expected to arrive in port at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Stop Transshipment</p>
<p>Although the food panic in this city has passed, the authorities of the two concessions have ordered people in the rice industry to jointly order 100,000 bags of foreign rice and transport them to Shanghai for storage in order to prepare for future needs. However, to stabilize the entire rice market, the first step is to increase reserves so that speculators cannot be active. Currently, about 10,000 bags arrive in port every day. However, the reserves do not increase because the rice transported to Shanghai is transshipped to other ports for supply. Yesterday, someone suggested that the transshipment of rice to other ports should be stopped immediately, or there should be some restrictions.</p>
<h3>Settlement of the Labor Strike at the French Tram Company, All Workers Resumed Work This Morning, Satisfactory Mediation by Aoulien Yesterday, Workers Claim No Political Background</h3>
<p>After the 700-plus workers in the carpentry shop of the French Tram Company went on strike due to their failure to get a wage increase, the political department of the French Concession has been mediating for days. Due to disagreements between labor and management, the negotiations have not yielded any results. The labor side then sent letters to French Consul General Aoulien, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, requesting mediation. Mr. Aoulien summoned the worker representatives the day before yesterday afternoon, urging them to resume work first, and promised a satisfactory response to their demands. As a result, about 100 workers resumed work at the factory that night. Yesterday was a holiday, but at 4:30 PM, four representatives from the labor side and representatives from the political department and the management side gathered at the French Consul General's office on Rue de la Gare to negotiate with Mr. Aoulien. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Labor's Four Demands</p>
<p>During the negotiations, the labor side put forward four demands: (1) The price of rice should be standardized at 50 yuan per picul. The allowance should be paid according to the previous regulations for prices within 50 yuan. If the price exceeds 50 yuan, the company will subsidize the excess amount. (2) The limit for wage increases for workers should be raised. (3) Wages should be paid for the period of the strike. (4) The company should pay for the medical expenses of workers injured in the conflict with the police on the first day of the strike.</p>
<p>All Workers Resumed Work This Morning</p>
<p>After several rounds of consultation, the company agreed to (1) increase the rice allowance by 15 cents per person per day, (2) increase wages by 40% across the board, (3) deduct 30 cents per day for temporary allowances for skilled workers and 24 cents for unskilled workers, (4) allow medical treatment for injured workers, and (5) pay wages for the period of the strike if work is resumed immediately. After discussing this answer last night, all the workers felt that the unskilled workers benefited very little, so they immediately sent representatives to the company authorities today to request an increase of 60% in the wages of unskilled workers. However, they expressed satisfaction with the other items and decided that all striking workers would resume work starting this morning.</p>
<p>Workers Claim No Background</p>
<p>According to workers yesterday, the reason for the strike was the recent high cost of living. The workers' income was too low, and their families were in a state of suffering, so they were forced to do this. When the workers last asked for a wage increase (when the price of rice was 40 yuan), the company authorities claimed that if the price of rice rose to 50 yuan, they would give another discretionary increase. Now the price of rice has exceeded 50 yuan significantly, so the workers' demands are not unreasonable. As for the rumors that the strike was a "political" action with a background, it is purely a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>No Signs of Italian Defense Forces Withdrawing</h3>
<p>After Italy's entry into the war made the Mediterranean situation tense, rumors spread that the 250-member naval Marine Corps of the Italian defense forces stationed in Shanghai, affiliated with the San Giorgio detachment, would be relocated to Hongkou. This was solemnly denied by the Italian military commander. However, a few days ago, rumors suddenly surfaced again that the Italian troops stationed in Shanghai would leave Shanghai and take a train to Tianjin. Italian officials in Rome formally denied the rumors that Italy would withdraw its defense forces in Shanghai the day before yesterday, proving that the rumors were completely unfounded. A reporter from the Daguang News Agency patrolled the Italian military defense zone in the Robison Road area of ​​western Shanghai yesterday and saw that the Italian soldiers deployed there were maintaining their normal state. The Italian defense force camp gate was still guarded by armed Marines with guns, and there were no signs of withdrawal.</p>
<h3>Deterioration of the Water and Gas Strike, New Factory Workers Respond, Old Factory Workers Go to Yangshupu to Negotiate, Company Temporarily Hires White Russians to Replace Workers</h3>
<p>After all the workers at the old factory of the Shanghai Gas Company on Yu Qiaqing Road went on strike on the 19th due to their failure to improve their treatment, the labor and management sides have not had the opportunity to negotiate in the past two days. Yesterday morning, about 200 workers at the new factory in Yangshupu went on strike to respond to the old factory workers. The company authorities have hired White Russians to replace the workers, and the situation of the strike is difficult to be optimistic about. A reporter from the Dazhong News Agency learned the details as follows:</p>
<p>Unable to Negotiate</p>
<p>The cause of the strike was that the company forced the coppersmith Yang Hanzhang to switch to other work. Yang refused and was fired. At the same time, it was believed that the company had failed to fully fulfill the obligations of the agreement signed between labor and management in April, which aroused the resentment of all the workers, so they put forward 16 demands to improve the treatment conditions. After the company refused, they went on strike. On the morning of the day before yesterday, Mr. Gu Bingyuan, director of the Industrial Section of the Public Works Department, was sent to mediate. Because the company authorities firmly rejected the workers' demands, it was impossible to negotiate. At 11:00 AM on the morning of the day before yesterday, the company authorities re-posted an English notice, which generally meant, "All workers are now limited to resume work uniformly at 7:00 AM on the 22nd (today), otherwise, no wages will be paid." On the workers' side, the crowd was indignant and tore up the notice on the spot, and the situation deteriorated.</p>
<p>New Factory Joins</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, representatives of the old factory workers went to Yangshupu to appeal to the new factory workers for sympathy and assistance. Yesterday morning, about 200 workers from the new factory also left the factory and went on strike, and the situation deteriorated further. It is found that all the gas (i.e., water and gas) in Shanghai is supplied by the new factory in Yangshupu, which is no different from the heart of all parts of the company and is of great importance. In order to protect the interests of users and continue to supply gas, the company authorities hired more than 50 White Russians to work in the factory.</p>
<h3>Ning Shao Rice Tries to Transship It to Other Ports</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai fellow villagers and wealthy businessmen from all walks of life in Shao County initiated fundraising for relief, the panic gradually became stable. (1) The rice price in the county fell from 120 yuan to about 80 yuan. (2) The rice price in Ningbo fell from 70-80 yuan per picul to 40-50 yuan. Even today, the panic has subsided slightly. The war in Zhenhai has restarted, the gap in Ningbo is blocked, and the shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang is interrupted. Rice has been ordered from abroad, and it is obviously impossible to load it onto ships and transport it for adjustment. According to the person in charge of the Ning Shao Fellow Villagers Association yesterday, since the war in Zhenhai broke out, alarms have been frequently reported in Ning Shao, and inland river transport is also difficult, so it is not easy to transship the purchased rice for relief. Moreover, both counties urgently need rice, so it seems difficult to calm the panic for a while. What is quite noteworthy is that there is no way to provide a large amount of relief, and its future is worrying. However, the affiliated Fellow Villagers Association may try to transship it to other ports for relief.</p>
<h3>Depositors of Nanjing Bank's Shanghai Branch Meet Regularly to Mediate</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai branch of Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank closed on the 18th of last month, the accounts were sorted out, and the deposits and loans could be offset. (The total capital of the bank is 1 million yuan.) Since the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce was consulted and disposed of, the registration of depositors began on the 1st of this month and ended on the 26th of this month. It has also been scheduled to hold a mediation meeting at the Banking Club on Hong Kong Road at 2:00 PM on the 28th. All depositors are requested to bring their deposit slips to the Shanghai Branch Office at No. 80 Jiujiang Road to collect their admission tickets from today to the 25th. Everyone must enter the venue with the ticket at that time. It is heard that the bank may resume business after the accounts are sorted out clearly. Currently, the Chongqing head office and the Hong Kong branch are still doing business as usual.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Gradually Wipe Out Japanese Troops Landing in Zhenhai, Fierce Fighting at Hongyuan Fort, Important Preparations Made for the Defense of the Min River</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Groups received the following report on the Zhenhai war yesterday: (1) The Japanese troops in the Xiaogang area have been defeated and retreated, and they have abandoned the estuary and retreated to warships. The Nishimura unit of the Japanese naval landing force that had penetrated into Zhenhai Jiangnan has been mostly cleared after being besieged by the Chinese army. Only the Hongyuan Fort is still stubbornly resisting the Japanese army, attempting to defend it. Except for this corner, there are no more Japanese troops in Jiangnan. (2) From 8:00 PM last night, the fighting around Hongyuan Fort was very fierce, and the sound of artillery fire could be heard in Ningbo. (3) The Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties in this invasion of Qingzhiling. We are now occupying a superior terrain and launching night attacks on the Japanese troops. By the afternoon of the 19th, we had won a complete victory and recaptured the Zhenhai Fort, re-hoisting the blue sky and white sun flag. All officers and soldiers of the fort had returned to the defense yesterday morning. (4) During the battle of Zhushanling Dama Road in Zhenhai Jiangnan, Lian Xiaotong, the company commander of the first company of the supplementary business of our army, was killed in action by a bullet. Soldiers and civilians mourned together.</p>
<p>Fire in Zhenhai</p>
<p>The situation in Zhenhai City has been in a state of chaos since the Japanese troops invaded. Since the outbreak of the fire, it has not been extinguished for three days. From Xiaoximen Daguan Temple to outside the Ximen Gate, all the houses in the area are still burning fiercely. After the Japanese troops entered the city, they first pulled Zhu Nanzhou to serve as the "Chairman of the Autonomous Association", and then changed to pulling Wu Luxiang and Li Zhongyu to serve as the "Chairman and Vice-Chairman". Currently, the residents in the city have all fled, and the situation is desolate.</p>
<p>Bombing of Eastern Yin</p>
<p>In recent days, Japanese planes have also frequently flown over various parts of Ningbo. Ningbo has been alarmed all day long. At 3:00 PM on the 20th, a Japanese plane flew to the back of the Zhiyuan Temple in Dongwu, eastern Yin, and dropped a burning bomb, causing no damage. At 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 19th, a Japanese plane flew to Meixu and dropped bombs, destroying the houses in front and behind the local police station. Another bomb landed on the riverside pier and immediately caught fire, burning down three or four houses, with no other losses.</p>
<p>Japanese Wounded Soldiers</p>
<p>According to a visitor from Dinghai, since the war in Zhenhai broke out, the Japanese army has used Dinghai as a base for invading eastern Zhejiang. All the Japanese officers and soldiers who were injured or killed in the battle of Zhenhaikou were transported by ship to the "Imperial Army Hospital" in Ximen, Dinghai, for medical treatment. The transportation was frequent after midnight, and the Yamashima base team of the Japanese naval landing force entrenched in Dinghai was also transferred to Zhenhaikou to reinforce the city, making the city extremely empty.</p>
<p>Situation in Southern Fujian</p>
<p>According to news from the Sanshan Guild Hall (Fujian Fellow Villagers Association) on Fuzhou Road and the Shanghai-based Fujian merchants, Quanzhou and Hanjiang were both bombed a few days ago, but the situation is still peaceful. Although Japanese warships appear and disappear unpredictably outside Sanjiangkou, they have not attempted to land. The blockade line of Chuanshi outside the Minjiang Estuary in Fuzhou is well guarded, and it is difficult for Japanese warships to easily invade. Everything else is normal. Letters and telegrams between Fuzhou and Shanghai are still being delivered as usual, but the post office is still suspending the collection and delivery of parcels.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Wenzhou Navigation</p>
<p>Since the Japanese announced the blockade of the Shanghai-Zhejiang-Fujian sea route, all foreign ships have temporarily suspended sailing to the ports. However, in recent days, because Wenzhou is as peaceful as ever, foreign ships are sailing as usual. The Feikang wheel of the German Luen Fat Yoko and the Polli wheel of the Italian Cia. Ital. Estremo Oriente have both sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai yesterday, and are expected to arrive safely today. However, whether to continue sailing in the future depends on changes in the situation. In addition, the British ship Mariamala also sailed to Songmen the day before yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Zhejiang Telecommunications</p>
<p>Regarding Shanghai-Zhejiang telegrams, it was widely rumored in this city yesterday that it takes a lot of time because they all have to be transshipped through Hong Kong. In addition, the delivery is slow due to the frequent military telegrams in Ningbo. The reporter immediately asked the American Commercial News Agency at No. 18 Bund, the Great Northern Telegraph Company at No. 34 Rue Edward VII, and the Great Eastern Telegraph Company whether there was difficulty in receiving and sending telegrams to eastern Zhejiang, and whether telegrams from Ningbo and other places arrived as usual. They claimed that the round trip of Shanghai-Zhejiang telegrams is still unimpeded. In addition, the Shanghai Postal Administration has already cleared the delivery of light postal items from various cities and counties in eastern Zhejiang, which are transported by trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway and forwarded through Hangzhou Wuxing.</p>

<h3>American Consulate Protests the Case of Japanese Beating and Insulting American Reporter, Apunte Has Moved to HSBC Building</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that the New York Times Far East correspondent Apunte was beaten and insulted by two armed masked Japanese men at 12:30 PM on the 20th in his apartment in Broadway Mansion, and the manuscript of a nearly completed book was robbed. He reported the details to the American Consulate in Shanghai. After receiving the report, the American Consul General has made</p>
<p>Strong Protest to the Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>After the incident, three Japanese military police visited Apunte to inquire. Apunte asked them to meet at his office in HSBC Building later, but the Japanese military police did not go again. According to reports, after the outbreak of the Shanghai War in August 1937, except for the Western police officers of the various police stations in northern Hongkou, no foreigners lived there, and Chinese people would be shot if they were seen.</p>
<p>Therefore, it has disappeared. At that time, Apunte's apartment in Hongkou was looted. Afterwards, Apunte returned to the apartment and saw that everything was messy, with paper and clothes all over the floor, and valuable ivory and jade were robbed. Several years later, the Japanese authorities compensated Apunte for some of this loss. When Apunte moved into the Broadway Mansion, the American Consulate authorities</p>
<p>Officially Announced on the Door of Apunte's Apartment</p>
<p>Saying that the occupant of the room is a real American citizen. However, on the afternoon of the 19th, a few hours before the Japanese invaded, Apunte removed the announcement to take a photo for memory, but did not hang it up immediately. Now Apunte has moved from the Broadway Mansion to the office in the HSBC Building.</p>
<h3>Denial from Customs Officials Regarding Change in Customs Gold Unit, Rumors of Reform by a Certain Party, Calculated According to New York Pound Price</h3>
<p>Recently, a certain party used the excuse that the customs gold unit has always been based on the London gold pound market. Now that the pound price has fallen, it has been greatly affected, so it wanted to implement changes on the 20th, using the New York gold pound market as the standard. As a result, the ratio of the gold unit has also increased accordingly. The exchange rate of the fake "Hua Xing Quan" has increased from 2.70 yuan to 2.877 yuan, and the market price of the gold unit to the legal tender has also increased from 4.279 yuan to 4.604 yuan. Therefore, the import tax levied on goods imported into Shanghai has also increased by about 8% invisibly. Citizens of this city believe that this measure by a certain party will indirectly suffer great losses in terms of consumption. According to the reporter from the Pingming News Agency, when asking relevant personnel of the Inspector General of Customs, this fact is not true.</p>
<h3>Mr. Xu Chengxu's Memorial Service Will Be Held Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Mr. Xu Chengxu, a reporter from this newspaper, unfortunately passed away last month due to typhoid fever. People from all walks of life deeply mourned. Now the Xu family has scheduled to hold a memorial service at Huguo Temple on Rue Moliere in the Public Concession on the 23rd (i.e., tomorrow). Mr. Xu had a wide range of friends during his lifetime, and he was always generous in helping others in need. However, he did not work well in production, so he was very desolate after his death. He left behind a widow and a young son, and their food, clothing, education, and upbringing will be very difficult in the future. Mr. Xu's friends have been sending elegiac gifts one after another. The colleagues of this newspaper have also collected cash and sent it. Mr. Xu's funeral residence is at No. 7 Yaanli, Rue List, French Concession.</p>
<h3>Tired Domestic Sales and Difficult Foreign Sales, Manufacturers' Doom, Factories in Shanghai Limit Production</h3>
<p>Since the European war has spread and the Far East situation has also changed accordingly, both Chinese and foreign manufacturers in Shanghai are now paying close attention to the impact of this situation on the manufacturers in this city, and to what extent it will reach. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the manufactures of manufacturers in Shanghai have been greatly affected by domestic sales because the vast areas of China have been caught in a state of war, and only the Nanyang countries are the dumping ground for competition. Today, the flames of war have forced people in any part of the world to limit consumption, and most of the import ban regulations are more stringent than before the war. Military transport has surpassed ordinary commodity transport. The high cost and difficulty of freight transport are very obvious. Recently, Britain and France have compromised with Japan, and Haiphong and the Yunnan-Burma Highway have been declared closed one after another, and the ports of Zhejiang and Fujian are facing fierce fighting. All this is enough to increase the anxiety of manufacturers in Shanghai. A reporter from Xin Sheng Du visited the person in charge of the China National Products Manufacturers Association yesterday. It is said that the manufacturers in Shanghai, especially the domestic product manufacturers, are probably the most difficult today. Raw materials are as high as that, and the difficulty of foreign sales is like this. The purchasing power of the masses has been more generally reduced due to the war. According to what the Association knows, some factories have implemented reduced work and limited production. What will happen in the future is really difficult to predict.</p>

It is also reported that when Mr. Zhang was attacked, a Polish national named Slanov, bravely stepped forward to chase the assailant and was fatally injured in the process. It is now learned that Mr. Slanov's funeral will also be held at the International Funeral Parlor at 3 PM this afternoon, with burial immediately following at the Hongqiao Cemetery in western Shanghai. Mr. Slanov, an ordinary foreigner, acted heroically and sacrificed his life. The police authorities also expressed their deep sorrow.

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I recently read a news item in your paper dated July 18 entitled "Friend Sues Over Three-Year-Old Loan of One Thousand Yuan," which I found shocking. I investigated and discovered that Yun Fei met Shen He-fang in 1920 when the latter was a junior clerk at the Zhi Cheng Money Exchange. Not long after, he lost his job and had nowhere to live, so he lodged at Yun Fei's business establishment for three years. Over time, he borrowed a total of 1,200 yuan. Yun Fei, understanding his difficult situation, did not press him for repayment, even though he repeatedly missed the deadlines. Only when he secured a position at the Kenye Bank did Yun Fei request repayment. Shen He-fang then avoided him. On January 26, 1928, Yun Fei sent a registered letter demanding repayment, but to no avail. He then filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court to recover the debt. Unexpectedly, Shen He-fang, being treacherous and cunning, secretly switched the paper of Yun Fei's demand letter and forged a "promissory note" dated April 28, 1933, payable in two months, claiming that Yun Fei owed him 1,000 yuan. Yun Fei, finding this intolerable, filed a criminal complaint with the court, accusing him of forgery. Yun Fei won both cases, and Shen He-fang was sentenced to four months in prison, as documented. However, Shen, being audacious, resorted to the trick of transferring evidence and was then successful in the second trial, with the court overturning the original verdict. After which he sued Yun Fei for false accusation, for the intention of extorting money. This case has been investigated in court and Yun Fei was found not guilty, concluding that Yun Fei had no intention of false accusation. Yun Fei, suspecting he would default on his debt, sought to extort money, so Yun Fei collected the proof of the second time he forged evidence, and again sued for forging documents. This is the true situation and story of the case. Everybody who knows Yun Fei and Shen He-fang knows about this case. He was unemployed in 1933, how could he have borrowed 1,000 yuan to Yun Fei. How could the false promissory note from 1,000 yuan have not been pursued until now? Wrong from Right are easily apparent, and this should not need to be discussed. Now that I read that this news is twisting the story and in turn, is defending Shen He-fang, is it a false rumor and being used by others? I am afraid the people from the outside have not discovered this, and I am writing to request a correction to avoid misrepresentation. I am writing to the local news department, Hu Yunfei</p>
<h3>Nanyang Soap Factory Burned Down Due to Carelessness; More Than Ten Factory Buildings Destroyed; Significant Losses of Raw Materials and Other Items</h3>
<p>The Nanyang Soap Factory at 740 Rue Heger, owned by Zheng Wei-ren from Shaoxing and managed by Zhang Ru-ren, was a large and thriving business. Originally located on Zhongxing Road in Zhabei, the factory temporarily relocated to Route Masrenet in the French Concession after the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle. It was rebuilt on Rue Heger the spring before last. The factory has a distribution point at 122 Route Tenant de la Tour, a branch on the west side of the Old Garbage Bridge Small Vegetable Market, and a second branch at the intersection of Carter Road and Avenue Haig, all of which are doing well. However, a fire broke out on the second floor of the warehouse at around 3:30 AM yesterday, consuming raw materials such as wax oil, paper, and wooden boxes. The flames raged fiercely and were impossible to approach. The firefighters quickly arrived in fire trucks and worked hard to extinguish the blaze, finally putting it out completely by 6:30 AM. As a result, eight factory buildings and six sheds were destroyed, and all the soap raw materials inside were reduced to ashes. It is estimated that the losses are significant. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the police. It is said that the factory had substantial fire insurance policies with Ning Shao, Yong Long, Zhao Tai, Hua An, and other insurance companies.</p>

<h3>Siyuan Middle School Adds a Second Division</h3>

The registration date for students who have not been admitted to other specially approved middle schools is still set for the 28th of this month and will not be extended beyond that date. Transcripts are currently being transferred from the original examination schools, and the results of the review will be notified separately. The registration method is detailed in the education news column of major newspapers on the 19th of this month. Students who have not been admitted to other specially approved middle schools can refer to it.</p>

<h3>合衆盃 Basketball Yesterday's Game: Youlian Defeated by Shanghai-Qingdao; 78-58, Game Tense in the Beginning but Relaxed Later; Big Upset in Division Two: Tongren Defeats Paramount</h3>
<p>The Union Cup Charity Basketball game. Yesterday, a big upset occurred in Division Two. In the game between Paramount and Tongren, Paramount made mistakes in their lineup from the start, and their adopted strategy was also flawed, leading to a significant error. They suffered a crushing defeat to Tongren by a score of 38 to 53, losing by 15 points. This marked Paramount's first defeat since their establishment. Currently, in Division Two, Tongren, Mu, Shangxing, and Paramount B each have one loss. However, Tongren and Mu have the most advantage because both teams still have four more opportunities to play, while Shangxing and Paramount have one less. At the start of yesterday's game, Paramount took the lead several times. Later, when Tongren surpassed them with a four-point advantage, Paramount missed two good opportunities under the basket. At the end of the first half, Paramount trailed by ten points with a score of 18 to 28. After switching sides, Paramount made some progress, narrowing the deficit to only five points (32 to 37). However, in the last five minutes, due to their eagerness to win and failure to closely monitor Tongren's main player, Xuan Tong, Tongren's score increased significantly, ultimately leading to a crushing defeat with a score of 38 to 53, which was truly unexpected.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Qingdao's Momentum</p>
<p>The game between Shanghai-Qingdao and Youlian was a touchstone for whether Shanghai-Qingdao could continue to maintain its league leader status. After the game started, both sides were fully focused. Sun Hupei kept records for Shanghai-Qingdao, and Fan Qingxian made a shot, and Zhou Wenyong made a free throw. Youlian later took the lead, and Chen Xuechong scored with a turnaround shot, surpassing them again. Youlian's Lu Gusui, Wei Zhenxing, Fan Qingxian, and Zhou Yaokang successively scored, adding nine points in an instant, giving them a clear advantage with a score of 12 to 4. This was Youlian's golden age. However, due to occasional defensive lapses, Shanghai-Qingdao's Shen Yugong and Da Mao scored seven points, and Li Zude made a long shot, putting Shanghai-Qingdao ahead with a score of 13 to 12. From then on, Shanghai-Qingdao marched forward, and Youlian was unable to regain the lead. After Ren Xiangcheng temporarily stopped due to torn pants, Shanghai-Qingdao's momentum grew stronger. Sun Hupei, Chen Xuechong, and Li Zude shot accurately and frequently, increasing their score. The score difference remained between two and three points. Youlian eventually succumbed. After Shanghai-Qingdao brought on Wang Caigao, Youlian brought on Shen Ji'en. After both sides reached 25 points, Shanghai-Qingdao's Chen Xuechong, Ren Shaocheng, and Shen Yugong consecutively scored seven points. At the half-time whistle, Shanghai-Qingdao led with a score of 32 to 27. After switching sides,</p>
<p>Youlian Discouraged</p>
<p>Shanghai-Qingdao's scoring was quite balanced, while Youlian only had Lu Gu who scored three times. With the score at 38 to 49, Youlian's morale plummeted. Chen Bangzhen, who was brought on by Shanghai-Qingdao, made significant contributions. Xing Yugong, Huipei, and Xuechong successively scored, causing Youlian to lose as many as sixteen points in a very short period. Thus, a major mistake was made. Therefore, although Zhou Wenyong and Fan Qingxian rallied, it was difficult to recover from this significant loss. At the end of the game, Shanghai-Qingdao achieved a final victory with a score of 78 to 58.</p>

<h3>The Reality of Raw Material Supply in the So-Called "Yen Bloc"</h3>
<p>— Translated by Mu Xiu</p>
<p>Japan occupied Manchuria in 1931 and then occupied another part of China from 1937. To what extent has it developed resources in these occupied areas to supply raw materials needed by its domestic industries? What are the possibilities for future development? It is quite difficult to answer these questions when the Japanese economy has fallen into an abnormal state due to the impact of long-term warfare. However, given the current trend of the world situation, these so-called "Yen Bloc" resources are very important to Japan. The success or failure of its adventurous actions on the mainland largely depends on whether it can use these resources to provide raw materials for its expanding industries. The materials used in this article come almost entirely from the Japanese side. Based on this material, about a quarter of Japan's total imports come from this "Yen Bloc." However, a closer analysis reveals many shortcomings. The output of some items has indeed increased, but the output of some other items has decreased. Moreover, the increase in the import of raw materials only indicates a shift in supply, not the development of construction. Due to currency inflation and the prevalence of natural disasters, North China has reached a state of economic bankruptcy and famine. The implementation of the heavy industry development plan in Manchuria is still halfway through, requiring massive investment. Therefore, it is in the same consuming position as North China for Japan. Can the Japanese ambition succeed under the difficulties surrounding capital, tools, and organization? It is truly doubtful. At least, without the help of foreign capital and a strong adjustment to its domestic and mainland policies, there is no hope of success.</p>
<p>The percentage of the "Yen Bloc"'s exports to Japan in Japan's total imports has indeed improved in the past two years, from 11.6% in 1937 to 21.2% in 1938 and 23.4% in 1939. However, the actual situation is not so appealing because in 1937, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and Japan greatly increased its imports from third countries. Therefore, the percentage of imports from the "Yen Bloc" was naturally particularly low. From 1928 to 1930, the average proportion of the "Yen Bloc" in Japan's trade was 27.6%, and from 1938 to 1939 it was 22.3%. This is an increase of only 5% before the Manchurian Incident. Even this slight increase is due to the expansion of Japan's wartime economic needs and the expansion of material demand on the mainland. However, the more resources Japan controls on the mainland, the more it depends on imports from third countries. The so-called self-sufficiency is just a dream.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Japan's imports of products from North China, except for iron, have all increased significantly, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>The import of coal has increased the fastest, and the import of wool has also increased. Although cotton and salt decreased in 1939, they were still higher than before the war. As for the imports from "Manchukuo" and the Kwantung Leased Territory, they are even less impressive.</p>
<p>What is noteworthy is that the import of coal has decreased sharply, and there has been no significant increase in other goods. Moreover, the increase in "Manchukuo"'s exports to Japan in the past two years has been mainly due to the increase in the export of soybeans and soybean cakes to Japan. If the price increase factor is taken into account, then this trade to Japan is actually decreasing. Why? Indeed, the important minerals and agricultural resources in the "Yen Bloc" area are extremely abundant, but there is a gap between the buried resources and their conversion into raw materials that can be exported to Japan.</p>
<p>In the Mainland of China</p>
<p>The main efforts of the Japanese are concentrated in North China and Inner Mongolia, but the development of this area is only just beginning. In fact, the general outline of the organization has not yet been fully established. The so-called "North China Development Company" has only formed four affiliated companies to operate telecommunications, railways, electricity, and salt. The total capital received by the general company is only 450 million yen in official shares and a small amount of raised debt. All development projects have been suspended due to lack of capital, inconvenient transportation, floods, and guerrilla activities. The only achievement in North China today is the sharp increase in the amount of coal exported to Japan. However, this increase is due to the Kailuan Coal Mine owned by British merchants. While expanding its production, the mine is also changing its supply direction: that is, it is now supplying Japan with what it previously supplied to Shanghai and other parts of China.</p>
<p>This kind of transfer can also be seen in other North China products exported to Japan, such as salt, cotton, and wool. However, the quantity of these exports to Japan has recently reversed. Taking cotton as an example, the current production of cotton in North China is not enough to meet the needs of local textile mills. The operating rate of textile mills in the area has been greatly limited. If this type of cotton continues to be exported to Japan, local textile mills will inevitably shut down completely. The sharp decline in cotton production in North China today is actually the result of China's implementation of a policy to prevent supplying the enemy.</p>
<p>Moreover, there is a great food panic in North China today, which not only makes farmers automatically change cotton fields to rice fields, but also weakens the external Shanghai source of the North China puppet government, because the external Shanghai that could have been used for material "construction" is now consumed in purchasing large amounts of food.</p>
<p>The wool trade in North China is mainly supplied by Inner Mongolia and other inland areas. This trade has long been monopolized by the Japanese, but the result is not good. First, because the Japanese have the power to manipulate prices, the purchase prices are low, so inland wool goods have to find other ways out, resulting in a sharp reduction in the Japanese-controlled source of wool goods in North China. Second, Mongolian wool goods are of poor quality and far inferior to Australian wool. Although Japan has tried its best to improve it, there has not been much progress because all the sheep are in the hands of the Mongolians.</p>
<p>Due to the development of coastal salt fields in North China and Manchuria, Japan's imports of salt from the "Yen Bloc" have greatly increased. In 1939,</p>
<p>Due to the great flood in North China, the salt fields were washed away and the salt deposits were lost, resulting in a sharp drop. Therefore, in August 1939, the "North China Salt Industry Company" was organized as a subsidiary of the "North China Development Company" with the aim of producing 2.1 million tons of salt in 1941. There is a similar plan in Manchuria.</p>
<p>North China's coal reserves are among the world's largest. Not only are the reserves as high as 200 billion tons, but the quality is also very good. However, the Japanese have not been able to restore their pre-war production. This year's production is estimated to be 12 million tons, which is less than the average of 15 million tons in previous years, and half of it comes from the Kailuan Coal Mine. Recently, the Japanese have paid attention to the Datong Coal Mine in Shanxi. If the transportation problem is solved, its development potential is greater.</p>
<p>There are criticisms of the proposal to develop the Datong Coal Mine, arguing that it is far away and expensive, and less cost-effective than the Shandong mines. However, the Japanese continue to plan to develop the deposits there. In January 1940, the "Datong Coal Mine Company" was organized with a capital of 40 million pseudo-Manchurian yuan. Half is borne by the Inner Mongolia puppet organization, and half is equally divided between the "North China Development Corporation" and the South Manchuria Railway Co., Ltd. According to the plan, the mine must produce 2.5 million tons of coal in the middle of 1940 and 4 million tons in 1941. Its production target is 26 million tons per year.</p>
<p>In order to eliminate the obstacle of inconvenient transportation, several plans have been proposed. The main one is the ten-year plan for the construction of Tanggu Port. It is heard that the construction of the Datong-Tanggu railway has begun. This line is 500 kilometers long, and is scheduled to be completed in four years, costing 190 million yen. This is enough to prove that before China's resources can be used by Japan, a large amount of investment and construction is required. When North China is unable to maintain its pre-war production, and Manchuria's exports to Japan are also declining, if the output of Kailuan is not increased, Japan's coal shortage will be even more severe than it is today.</p>
<p>In Manchuria</p>
<p>Manchuria's "development" has lasted for eight years. From 1932 to 1939, the total investment of the Japanese reached 3 billion yen. However, the rewards Japan has received are minimal. This is not due to the lack of resources in Manchuria, but the result of investing in military objectives. Under the control of the Kwantung Army, Japanese capitalists have no freedom to invest. All development and exploitation in Manchuria is monopolized by official and semi-official companies. Its development does not focus on increasing the production of raw materials transported to Japan and promoting the increase of agricultural production, but on the huge heavy industry plan promoted by the Kwantung Army, attempting to establish an industrial base on the mainland. The so-called five-year plan is this. Starting in 1937, it was implemented with considerable effort, especially in the steel and mineral industries, hydroelectric power, and coal liquefaction. The implementation of these plans depends on Germany's cooperation. In the past, "Manchukuo" often exchanged soybeans for German machinery, but since the outbreak of the European War, trade has been suspended. This five-year plan has inevitably failed to proceed. Today's "Manchukuo" is in a difficult situation. Although the investment is huge, the construction is still halfway through. The future is bleak, and the completion of the plan is still far away. It has no choice but to modify the plan. It currently seems to focus on the production of coal, iron, and light metals for export to Japan.</p>
<p>The result of the Kwantung Army's industrial plan has also made "Manchukuo" an economic drain for Japan. That is, it only shares Japan's capital and cannot help Japan. Because the raw materials Japan has obtained in Manchuria, except for soybeans and soybean cakes, have not increased. However, the need for capital tools and consumer goods in "Manchukuo" has increased sharply. Japan's gambling money for development in Manchuria is increasing, but when will the reward be reached? It is unknown. It is impossible to know the raw materials for some of the items in Japan's huge exports to Manchuria, which are manufactured by Japan purchased from third countries with foreign exchange, although it cannot be confirmed. But there is no doubt that the number must be huge.</p>
<p>"Manchukuo"'s supply of raw materials to Japan is not as much as it could be. Coal is a very good example. Although Manchuria's coal reserves are not as abundant as those in North China, their distribution is also quite extensive. Including newly discovered ones, the reserves have been increased from the pre-war estimate of 48 billion tons to over 200 billion tons. The largest are the Fushun Coal Mine of the South Manchuria Railway Co., Ltd. and the mining areas belonging to the Manchuria Coal Mine Co., Ltd. Although their production has increased, they have not been able to keep up with the coal needs of the emerging industries and railways in Manchuria. The coal shortage in "Manchukuo" is as serious as in Japan.</p>
<p>Regarding oil, in addition to the small amount produced by the experimental oil wells in Fuxin and Zhalainuoer and the new oil fields recently discovered in "Tonghua Province", Manchuria's oil sources are limited to petroleum shale and coal liquefaction industries. This liquefaction industry is of medium size and has begun production, but it has been severely hit by the interruption of German machine supplies. According to the original plan, four plants will be set up, but only one plant of Naiman in Fushun has started working. But its production is still very limited.</p>
<p>Since 1930, Fushun has been refining oil from oil shale. Last year's production reached 350,000 tons, and it is scheduled to reach 1 million tons by the end of 1941. The reserves of petroleum shale in Fushun are quite abundant, but they are useless in the current coal shortage. Therefore, its production is still far below the needs of "Manchukuo" itself. However, because part of the crude oil has a special contract with the Japanese Navy, it has to be exported to Japan. And those for Manchurian use have to be imported from abroad again.</p>
<p>Although Manchuria's mineral resources are important, agriculture is still the foundation of its social economy. However, compared with industry and mining, it is far less valued by the Japanese. The output of agricultural products only maintains the number before the incident. The output of some agricultural products has even decreased. However, "Manchukuo" has recently begun to focus on the development of agriculture. Agricultural products account for about half of Manchuria's exports to Japan, most of which are soybeans and soybean cakes, and also include oilseeds, silk, and wool. The increase in the export of soybeans and soybean cakes to Japan in the past two years has been due to the inflation of the Yen Bloc currency and the rise in soybean prices, but exports to third countries have decreased; however, exports to Germany and Italy have not decreased at that time. And with the outbreak of the European War, the German and Italian markets have also decreased successively. As a result, the output to places within the "Japanese Group" has increased. This situation is not a good sign.</p>
<p>In 1936, Japan obtained 271,000 metric tons of pig iron from Manchuria, accounting for 27% of pig iron imports; and 1,264,400 metric tons of iron ore from China, accounting for 31%. Although the recent numbers are unknown because Japan has not made them public, judging from China's trade reports, it can be seen that in the past three years, the export of iron ore to Japan has plummeted: that is, from 1.3 million metric tons in 1936 to 100,000 metric tons in 1939.</p>
<p>Although most of China's important mining areas have fallen into the hands of the Japanese, their production has still declined significantly. These mining areas include the mines in the existing Yangtze River area and the undeveloped Longyan mines in Chahar. The recovery of iron ore production in Central China seems possible, but the Longyan Iron Mine in North China's Chahar has little hope. Last summer, Japan had a Longyan Iron Mine Company organized with a capital of 20 million yen; at the same time, it built a branch line to connect with the Ping Sui Railway, but now the output is only hundreds of thousands of tons. In addition to the Longyan Iron Mine, the Japanese also rebuilt a 250-ton blast furnace at Shijingshan near Beiping to engage in smelting, and received several small-scale smelting furnaces in Shanxi. However, most of the ore obtained by Japan in China today still comes from the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Although the steel industry in Manchuria has been valued, it has not been outstanding to Japan for several years. The situation is the same as that of coal production. All the increased output has been offset by the increased local demand. The expansion of Manchuria's steel industry really began ten years ago after the problem of poor ore quality was solved. The production of pig iron was 210,000 tons in 1929 and had risen to 762,000 tons in 1937. A wire mesh factory was established in 1936, and the five-year plan began the following year. In the spring of 1939, the production capacity of pig iron and steel of Showa Steel Works Co., Ltd. increased to 1.7 million tons and 580,000 tons, respectively. Benxi Lake Iron Plant also plans to increase its production from 150,000 to 500,000 tons. However, these plans are hindered by the lack of coking coal and building materials. Showa's steel production has declined last year; the two 600-ton smelting furnaces in Benxi Lake, which have been under construction since 1937, have not been completed due to lack of raw materials. Completion will be after June 1940 at the earliest.</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>From all aspects, Japan's development of the raw material deposits in the Yen Group is only just beginning; almost all the coal and iron buried in North China have not been exploited; although Japan has obtained more raw material supply from the mainland than before, it is still in the stage of "sowing and fertilizing". During this continuing war of attrition in China, Japan feels extremely difficult to raise the capital and tools needed to develop North China and complete the heavy industry plan in Manchuria, which is only just beginning. However, the burden of development in these two places must be borne entirely by Japan, but Japan has absolutely no ability to develop it alone. Therefore, under the current circumstances, these two places can be said to be a stumbling block for Japan, rather than its lifeline.</p>

<p>(Notice for this column) The answer to the foreign cotton discount question asked by Mr. Liao Yuanying in the previous issue of this column was provided by Mr. Zhang Fangren. The worker did not include Mr. Zhang's name, so this is corrected.</p>
<p>Mr. He Ying: Your proposed plan is excellent. There is definitely no problem with sales, just contact the local product company or the national goods market in this city, and there will be a solution. As the reporter knows, this kind of local product is very popular among all circles, such as Guizhou's silver fungus, leather goods: Fan Nan's ham, white medicine, leather goods, etc.: travelers like to bring some when going abroad, and they are snapped up by friends along the way. In short, your opinion is not only beneficial to you personally but also beneficial to the country. However, the procurement and transportation methods to Shanghai still need to be carefully planned, otherwise the cost may be too high.</p>

<h3>Cooked Coal Still Holds Original Price</h3>
<p>The market for cooked coal has been inseparable from the price of coal balls. Recently, although the price of coal balls has fallen again and again, cooked coal has gone in the opposite direction, maintaining the original price without any changes. According to the discount of a certain line of peers, it is 180 yuan per ton from the car, and 9 yuan per load for retail in the store, which is almost 2 yuan more expensive than 100 catties of coal balls. Therefore, business is sluggish, and it is not what it used to be.</p>
<h3>Sugar Price Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the sugar market stabilized, with only 2 or 3 corners of fluctuation. The association's pricing disk: the spot price of 24 coarse white local warehouse goods is 68 yuan, 3 corners, and a small 2 corners. The price of foreign warehouse is 68 yuan and 2 corners, without any fluctuation. The price of transit goods is 52 yuan, 7 and a half corners to 8 corners, and a small 2 corners. The price for delivery in 30 days is 53 yuan and 3 corners, without any change. Taikoo's car white B mark is still 78 yuan, the HX mark is 75 yuan, and Dutch red is 58 yuan and 2 corners, and a small 3 corners. The prices of local factory's cotton white and No. 1 ice sugar remain unchanged. The prices of national sugar are all called original prices, and no transactions have been heard.</p>
<h3>Taena Mala Rubber Share Distributes Final Dividend</h3>
<p>The Taena Mala Rubber Co., Ltd., managed by the British company Detailed Mao Foreign Firm, had a surplus of approximately 750,000 yuan for the year ending at the end of March 1940. In addition to the first interim dividend of 5 cents per share and the second interim dividend of 1 corner per share, totaling 1 corner and 5 cents per share, it is proposed to continue to distribute a final dividend of 3 corners per share, totaling 4 corners and 5 cents for the year. In addition, the company's 24th annual shareholders' meeting is scheduled to be held on August 14. A temporary shareholders' meeting will be held after the meeting.</p>

<h3>Financial Review</h3>
<p>— Sheng Kaiqiong</p>
<p>——Up to July 20th—— (Continued)</p>
<p>The preceding discussion explains the necessity of the increased issuance of legal tender from the perspective of implementing the legal tender system. However, it cannot be assumed that the increase in legal tender is solely due to this factor. There are also reasons related to warfare, economics, and finance. The so-called "warfare reasons" stem from the fact that the southeastern half of the country was the first to suffer from invasion. People with moderate to high incomes either moved away in advance or followed the Chinese army westward. During this massive population shift, they often withdrew their past savings from banks and kept them on hand for living expenses, resulting in a substantial demand for legal tender. Consequently, the amount of legal tender issued increased. The so-called "economic reasons" are due to the southwestern and northwestern provinces being known before the war for "financial depletion, capital shortage, goods buried in the ground, and inability to develop." After the war broke out, especially after the westward shift of the war and the accompanying relocation of the military, political, and economic center of gravity, no effort was spared in economic construction and resource development to sustain long-term operations, thus requiring a large amount of capital. Moreover, since the basis of China's war effort mainly lay in agriculture, agricultural loans were vigorously pursued—such as the 400 million yuan in agricultural loans planned by the Four Joint Offices. As a result, the amount of legal tender issued increased along with the expansion of the financial network of the Four Banks, due to the urgent need for funds from various parties. The so-called "financial reasons" relate to the fact that during the war, the Chinese government issued national currency bonds for national salvation, national defense, military supplies, construction, disaster relief, etc., totaling 223 million yuan by 1939. As part of their duties, the Four Banks had to subscribe to or accept collateral for a portion of these bonds, which increased both the assets of securities and collateralized loans, and the liabilities of banknote issuance, on the banks' balance sheets. In addition, the Chinese government's efforts to collect gold and silver during the war, increased investment and remittances from overseas Chinese to the southwest and northwest, and foreign donations, all required legal tender for conversion, which was also a reason for the increased issuance of legal tender.</p>
<p>In summary, the main reasons for the increase in legal tender are the incomplete implementation of the legal tender system nationwide, the development of the southwest and northwest, and the implementation of economic construction to achieve the goals of resistance and nation-building. Secondary reasons include the redemption of gold and silver and the hoarding by the people. Financial measures during the war played a relatively small role.</p>
<p>Issuance of Construction Gold Bonds</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Chongqing, China will issue new public bonds, including military supply bonds amounting to ______ yuan, and reconstruction gold bonds totaling 10 million pounds sterling and 50 million US dollars. The Executive Yuan's meeting on February 10th had already passed the draft principles and regulations for the 1940 military supply bonds and reconstruction gold bonds. However, the military supply bond regulations have not been published, while the reconstruction gold bond regulations were promulgated by the National Government in February.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out here that the new public bonds to be issued are military supply bonds and reconstruction gold bonds. The so-called reconstruction gold bonds should be half of the reconstruction gold bonds that have not yet been issued. The contents of the military supply bond regulations are currently unavailable. The main contents of the gold bonds are as follows:</p>
<p>The National Government is issuing British pound gold bonds of 10 million pounds and US dollar gold bonds of 50 million US dollars to raise funds for construction projects. Both will be issued in two tranches, with the first tranche on May 1st and the second tranche on November 1st, each tranche consisting of 5 million pounds sterling and 25 million US dollars. The annual interest rate is 5%. Interest will be paid only for the first two years, and principal will be repaid starting from 1942, with drawings every six months for principal and interest repayment. The bond denominations are 1,000, 100, 50, 10, and 5 pounds sterling, and 5,000, 1,000, 100, 50, 10, and 5 US dollars.</p>
<p>Currencies for purchasing the reconstruction gold bonds, in addition to British pounds, US dollars, or other foreign currencies or foreign exchange converted at the current exchange rate into US dollars or British pounds, may also be used in legal tender converted at the exchange rate quoted by the Ministry of Finance, and British pound bonds or US dollar bonds will be issued according to the subscriber's designation. This provision is not found in the subscription methods of the gold bonds issued in 1938, and it is indeed a characteristic of the issuance method of the reconstruction gold bonds, which can facilitate the promotion of these gold bonds. The reason is: (To be continued)</p>

<p>Ancient Methods of Locust Control (3)</p>
<p>Locust plagues invariably occur simultaneously with drought. When the weather is snowy and rainy, the locusts are on the verge of death because they cannot fly, and they are full and heavy. Soaked in accumulated puddles, they will inevitably swell and rot to death. During droughts, when it is also bitterly hot, with the red sun in the sky, their wings are thin and dry and will catch fire easily. Thus, when they fly near the fields, bundles of firewood should be lit and raised toward the sky. They will be struck by the heat and fall, most with scorched wings and broken legs, dropping into the fields, making them easy to collect. Some may doubt that there are too many locusts. Coming in squads from the eastern and western fields, it may be impossible to respond everywhere. However, farmers guarding their own ridges, at this time of disaster and drought, are either drawing water with well sweeps, or weeding and not planting. They are always in the fields preparing fire-fighting equipment and can easily burn them themselves. Moreover, after they have fallen and started feeding, they can be captured. Even if they are everywhere, dense without gaps, they can be scooped up and filled to overflowing. However, burning them is still faster. Last year, the drought almost became a disaster, and the locusts had already come out in force. I heard that in addition to ordering officials to hire laborers, even garrison troops were deployed in formation, as if a major factory was ahead. Although it is said that there were many locusts, it seems like making a mountain out of a molehill. Moreover, the method of capturing them is only to search the fields and release them into the large rivers, with no other strategy. Garrison troops are not skilled in farming, and they are generally rough and violent by nature. When searching and capturing in separate groups, there is inevitably a risk of trampling on crops. It would be better to let the people capture them themselves. Capturing and killing them is more difficult, and it is not as good as burning them with fire.</p>

<h3>Inscriptions on Utensils</h3>
<p>— Jingfang</p>
<p>In ancient times, gentlemen inscribed daily utensils based on their nature, as a reminder and to cultivate morality and temperaments, which was quite helpful. This originated with Tang's inscription on a washbasin, saying, "If you can one day renovate yourself, do so every day; yea, constantly renovate yourself." Wang Wei of the Ming Dynasty had twenty inscriptions on utensils, whose reasoning was clear and essential, capable of correcting the world and rectifying people's hearts. Several are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Inscription on a Hat: Your shape is upright, therefore you reside at my crown. If my virtue is deficient, how can I be the first among men?</p>
<p>Inscription on Shoes: Proceed with righteousness, tread with trustworthiness, do not step on impropriety, do not approach danger.</p>
<p>Inscription on a Mat: I rest my body in ease, leaning on you. My heart is upright, you cannot roll it up.</p>
<p>Inscription on Bedclothes: When lifted and applied, they shelter one body. If one can extend them, they cover the distant and near.</p>
<p>Inscription on a Chest: Do not store what is not righteous, do not reveal what is not proper.</p>
<p>Inscription on a Mirror: As for the beauty or ugliness of appearance, you distinguish the external. As for the goodness or evil of the heart, how can you reflect the internal?</p>
<p>Inscription on a Comb: The hair is in disarray, it can be straightened. The government is in chaos, how can it be governed?</p>
<p>Inscription on a Ruler: An accumulation of one hundred parts forms one foot. Foot upon foot, I do not know its end. Learning is achieved in such a manner.</p>
<p>Inscription on a Wine Vessel: Use this to write articles, always thinking of clarity. Use this to record events, always thinking of fairness. Use this to record lawsuits, always thinking of life. Use this to record wealth, always thinking of lightness.</p>
<p>Inscription on a Cupboard: Empty its interior, so it may contain. Only when it can contain, can it be filled for a long time.</p>
<h3>My Views on Promoting Short Clothing</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Naichao was given the cold shoulder by the elevator operator for wearing short clothing. This is naturally a fact, and it cannot be denied that Shanghai people do have the bad habit of "valuing clothes over people." We poor scholars occasionally go to banquets at large restaurants or visit friends at large hotels. Watching the attentive reception of servants and waiters towards those who are splendidly dressed, while we only receive icy glares, perhaps everyone feels a bit aggrieved. Then, wearing casual clothing is somewhat close to being vulgar, and being given the cold shoulder is expected!</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the styles of Chinese short clothing are not very good, based on traditional concepts and psychological effects. However, the actual lack of generosity and beauty is also one of the reasons for being considered "petty." However, whether every reform can succeed must be built on the effectiveness of the advocates and the support of the masses. From the advocacy of a few to the implementation of the majority, there will be many discriminations and many tribulations. Without the courage to persevere and without consistent steps to follow, even a very ideal reform will undoubtedly fail.</p>
<p>Therefore, putting aside the issues of generosity and beauty, when it comes to promoting short clothing, the only prerequisite is how to promote it? The following points may be worth considering:</p>
<p>One: Social celebrities should take the lead in advocating it, such as setting an example at ordinary gatherings or usual social engagements.</p>
<p>One: Shops, companies, firms, and stores (except those with existing uniforms) should require employees to wear short clothing in order to be more agile. It would be best to follow the example of the China National Goods Company in encouraging staff and trainees to wear uniforms, and give them a free laundry reward.</p>
<p>One: Agencies and schools (except those who originally wear uniforms) should allow teachers and staff to wear short clothing for classes and office work.</p>
<p>One: The tailoring of short clothing should avoid being the same as that worn by the general special classes, which would cause people to feel disgusted.</p>
<h3>The Economic Vitamin C</h3>
<p>— Ainong</p>
<p>Vitamins are nutrients that are closely related to our bodies, maintaining normal development and health. If we lack vitamins, it will lead to very serious consequences. There are many types of vitamins, so the consequences are also different. Lack of vitamin A reduces weight and causes developmental delays. Lack of vitamin B easily causes beriberi. Lack of vitamin C causes scurvy, gradually destroying blood and leading to the risk of death. Lack of vitamin D causes rickets and toothaches, weakening the body's resistance. Vitamin E is related to reproduction, and there is also vitamin F...; their discovery has been quite recent, with only about twenty years of history. Some have only been discovered recently, and their relationship with the human body is not yet fully understood. Some scientists are still studying them, and in the near future, vitamin research may make even more progress.</p>
<p>Now it is summer, and bright red, shiny tomatoes can be found everywhere in the farmers' markets, indicating that this year's production is very abundant. The supply of tomatoes in the market exceeds demand, and prices are very low. Ten or more can be bought for just one dime. Tomatoes are rich in vitamin C, which is very beneficial to us. Their effect is comparable to that of Florida oranges, which we cannot afford. One orange costs about one yuan, while a tomato costs only one cent each, but the effects are the same. Why not? If you go to the pharmacy to buy one cubic centimeter of pure vitamin C, it will probably scare you away. So tomatoes are indeed an affordable and high-quality nutritional product. However, we Chinese people don't particularly like to eat them, and some make soup out of them. But tomatoes must be eaten raw. If they are cooked, the vitamin C they contain will lose its effectiveness. So we wash the tomatoes we buy with clean water, peel off the outer skin, dip them in sugar, and eat them, and we will be foolproof. Although they have a bit of a grassy smell, considering their nutritional value, we have to eat them as if we are drinking bitter medicine. In fact, their grassy smell is very slight. So I am a proponent of eating tomatoes, because they are a popular nutritional product!</p>
<h3>Two Stories About Housing</h3>
<p>— Fan Juhui</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Zhenzong, there was a Duke Li Wenjing from Taiyuan. He was a prime minister in Kaifeng County, Henan. He built a residence inside Fengqiu Gate, where the hall could only accommodate a horse turning around. At that time, his friend asked him, "Duke, why did you build your residence so small?"</p>
<p>Duke Li Wenjing smiled and replied, "My residence will be passed down to my descendants. Now that I am the prime minister of the country, it is of course relatively small. But in the future, when my descendants hold small official positions, they will certainly find it too spacious, right?"</p>
<p>His friend was speechless.</p>
<p>In ancient Greece, there was a great philosopher, Socrates. When he was lecturing, he built a residence according to his needs. The residence was so small that it looked like a box. His neighbor asked him strangely, "Sir, you are a great figure of our time, why did you build such a small residence?"</p>
<p>Socrates replied, "If this small residence of mine can accommodate all my loyal friends in one place, I will be very happy."</p>
<h3>Methods of Determining Direction</h3>
<p>— Aimin</p>
<p>Directions are distinguished as east, south, west, and north. Suppose someone wants to go to a certain place in the east. If they do not go east but west, there is no other way to reach that place except by going around the earth. Therefore, when we travel far away and get lost in the wilderness, even if we know that we can get home by going south, we don't know which direction is south. So we are hesitant and have no idea. Especially when traveling alone, or at night, in places where there are no traces of people, we feel extremely terrified. If we just wander around blindly, it is even more dangerous.</p>
<p>Since we know the danger of getting lost, we must come up with a way to determine direction. The good method of determining direction that I am talking about is not to purchase a compass, because not everyone has a compass. So this good method of determining direction is simply to deduce it with brainpower. For example, observing the sunrise and sunset is a good method of determining direction. Other methods, such as observing the shady side of plants and the direction of the wind, are also good methods of determining direction.</p>
<p>When observing the shady and sunny sides of plants, you must first observe where it is moist and where moss grows. The moist places and the places where moss grows are the shady sides. The opposite is the sunny side. Shade is north, and sun is south. This is the first good method of determining direction.</p>
<p>The direction of the wind varies with the seasons. Generally speaking, in spring, sunny and dry weather has more southeasterly winds, and humid and rainy weather has more easterly winds. In summer, sunny weather has more southerly or southeasterly winds, and rainy weather has more northerly winds. In autumn, the wind is more unpredictable and cannot be determined. In winter, there are more westerly and northwesterly winds. But sometimes the wind is weak, and the direction of the wind cannot be determined for a while. You can throw soil or ashes into the air and see which way it flies. In places with trees, you can carefully observe the direction of the leaves swaying. This is the second good method of determining direction.</p>
<p>If it is night, and you cannot see the shady and sunny sides of plants clearly, and if there is no wind, then isn't it terrible? But don't worry, you can look up at the sky to find the North Star or the Big Dipper. If you find them, that is north. The rest can be inferred accordingly. This is also a method of determining direction.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three good methods of determining direction, there are many more complicated methods that cannot be fully described in simple words. If the above three can be applied in practice, they are foolproof, because the author has already tested them one by one.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Jiang Lü</p>
<p>In the recent world political arena, the most popular star is German leader Hitler. His living conditions are, of course, of great concern to everyone. Now I will briefly introduce them:</p>
<p>Clothing: Hitler has always been unconcerned about clothing. Usually, he only wears the brown shirt uniform, or a dark blue serge suit, in addition to a raincoat and a hat. In June 1934, when Hitler met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, his entourage only brought casual clothes for Hitler. When he got off the plane, he saw that Mussolini and the Italian welcoming personnel were all wearing uniforms. At that time, Hitler was very embarrassed. He suspected that his entourage had deliberately teased him, so he reprimanded them.</p>
<p>Food: Hitler is a vegetarian, but he is very particular about cooking methods. Once, when Mussolini hosted him, he exceptionally ate two fried eggs. Sometimes, he also drinks some coffee, and once or twice a week he goes to the Kaiserhof Hotel (the organ department before the Nazi Party came to power) to drink chocolate tea. Hitler utterly abhors smoking and drinking. Not only does he abstain himself, but he does not allow others to smoke around him.</p>
<p>Housing: Hitler's office is in the Chancellery on Wilhelmstrasse in Berlin. He rarely goes to the Presidential Palace, located a hundred yards away on the same street, because he does not want people to think back to the German Reich of the presidential era. The Chancellery was renovated once after Hitler came to power, and the decoration was all done with the latest-style glass and metal. Hitler himself helped design it, and the depiction was the story of the Nordic deity Wotan. There is a veranda in front of the residence. During major ceremonies, Hitler often stands on it to inspect. It is said that there is also a bomb shelter under the living room. Hitler's private residence is in Munich, and it is built very luxuriously. In BerchteSgaden (a small village in southern Bavaria), Hitler has a villa, Hans Wachenfeld. From that architectural marvel, one can see his hometown—Austria. Hitler often goes to these two places to rest in his spare time.</p>
<p>Transportation: For security reasons, Hitler's movements are extremely secret. No one knows where he will go next. He usually travels in the highest-speed Mercedes-Benz cars and safe airplanes. Trains are not often taken. When Hitler travels in the highest-speed car, three Brownshirt guards sit behind Hitler, while Hitler himself sits next to the driver. Sometimes, those guards do not sit in the car but stand on the running boards of Hitler's car, with their right hands on the triggers of their pistols as a warning. As for the road, the precautions are naturally very strict when Hitler's car passes. In the plane, Hitler never talks to anyone, and there are very few opportunities to move around or smile. Perhaps it is to maintain the dignity of the leader that he is like this.</p>

<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>In the scorching summer weather, the heat makes people lose their appetite. Overly greasy foods are truly daunting. Therefore, we often eat cold dishes these days. Among cold dishes, the most common is toon mixed with tofu. There's no need for soy sauce; just use refined salt mixed into the tofu. Finely chop salted toon, add sesame oil, and mix it all together. It's refreshing whether eaten with porridge or rice. Among meat dishes, the most delicious is chicken shreds mixed with sesame sauce, often occupying a prominent position in cold platters at summer banquets. However, eating chicken at home is really too expensive, so we can only substitute with shredded pork. In addition, dishes like shredded pork with mung bean sheets, dried shrimp with cucumber, scallion oil or jellyfish with shredded radish are all seasonal delicacies in home cooking.</p>

<h3>On the Shanghai Municipal Council's Reassessment of Rent</h3>
<p>— Wang Ping</p>
<p>Previously, the Shanghai Municipal Council faced a significant financial shortfall. Consequently, it reduced staff within the bureau to save expenses and proposed increasing land tax and municipal surcharges (i.e., house tax) by 50% starting July 1st of this year. Although this measure increased the burden on residents within the Shanghai International Settlement, in light of the Council's difficulties, the proposal was ultimately approved by taxpayers on April 17th of this year.</p>
<p>The tax increase was implemented on July 1st. However, when we received the payment notice, we saw that in addition to the 50% surcharge on land tax, the house tax was levied based on a rent reassessment increased by 18% last month, plus the 50% surcharge. As a result, the currently assessed rent for the same property has increased more than tenfold compared to the previous assessment, and the amount of tax collected, with the added surcharge, has increased even more dramatically.</p>
<p>Considering the difficulties faced by the Shanghai Municipal Council during this extraordinary period, we still agreed to pay the 50% surcharge on land tax and municipal surcharges, even though we ourselves are in dire economic straits. However, the Council does not seem to understand the plight of us taxpayers. It has reassessed rents and increased them by an astonishing multiple in order to increase its tax revenue. Whether or not people will criticize the Council's actions as inappropriate, I dare to state the reasons as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This rent reassessment is limited to Chinese-style houses (such as bungalows) within the Shanghai International Settlement. Therefore, the house tax levied based on the newly assessed rent is limited to these houses. This measure seems unfair, as it is said that other types of houses within the Settlement will only have house tax levied based on the newly assessed value starting January 1st of next year. So why is the Council being so harsh on Chinese-style houses, levying tax based on the newly assessed value from today, half a year earlier?</p>
<p>(2) Furthermore, the assessed rents this time are very unreasonable. For the same property, the assessed price is more than ten times higher than the previous assessment, simply because of the difference in time. I heard from a senior official in the Council's Tax Department that some properties have even increased by thirty or forty times. If asked why there is such an increase in value, it would be difficult to answer. Land may increase in value due to transportation development and other reasons, but there is no reason for houses to increase in rental value so drastically when they have not been renovated or added to. If it is said that this is due to the population congestion within the Settlement during the war, then in reality, although rents are higher now than before the war, they are not that much higher. Moreover, the Council is also suspected of encouraging landlords to raise their rents.</p>
<p>(3) If the Council reassesses factory or shop rents in the future (said to start on January 1st of next year), then based on what has already happened, it will inevitably increase their assessed value. Industrial and commercial businesses can then use the excuse that operating expenses have increased due to house tax and raise the prices of their goods. This result will significantly impact the effectiveness of the Council's efforts to stabilize prices.</p>
<p>In conclusion, during this period of war, people of all nationalities within China have experienced hardships. How can the residents of Shanghai be exempt? However, the Council should also share the joys and sorrows with the residents within the Settlement and understand each other's difficulties. It should be known that the prosperity of the Shanghai International Settlement depends on the economic prosperity of the residents within the Settlement. If they are too poor, then not only will the prosperity of the Shanghai International Settlement cease to exist, but even the security within the Settlement will become a major problem.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Focuses on the Profiteering of Second Landlords</h3>
<p>— Xiao Ming</p>
<p>On the 17th, a news item was published in this newspaper's local news column entitled "Shanghai Municipal Council Discusses Rent Issues, Focuses on the Profiteering of Second Landlords." The gist of it was that landlords generally only increased rents by about 10% compared to before the war, while second landlords increased rents on third tenants by more than double. According to the cost of living index, the latter has risen by about 205%.</p>
<p>This news is, of course, very pleasant for us "third tenants" to hear. We feel that the second landlords increase rents on the third tenants by more than double, and even more than triple is common.</p>
<p>The difficulty of increasing security in the Shanghai International Settlement certainly has a large "cause," but the instability of citizens' lives, and the so-called "crimes" that arise from it, are certainly numerous. Not to mention the big ones like theft, robbery, and fraud, but the small ones like "verbal disputes" under every roof, if there were monthly statistics, I think the length of the numbers would probably break all world records and be shocking!</p>
<p>Human life is now at its extreme of suffering, but just for the problem of "housing," probably 99% of the five million citizens of Shanghai are in pain! In this way, the Municipal Council's ability to pay attention to the "profiteering" of second landlords is not only a slight liberation for the majority of citizens in Shanghai in terms of material, but also a good plan for citizens in terms of spirit.</p>
<p>Today's newspaper also has news that the Municipal Council believes that "the valuation of real estate should not be too high," saying that "the authorities have paid close attention to it, and all parties deeply hope that the excessive profits of second landlords can be strictly restricted in the future, and the authorities should not give excessively high valuations to certain houses for the sake of donations and taxes, so that the rent problem can be gradually resolved and return to a reasonable normal state." It is worth noting here that the Municipal Council's increase in donations and taxes since July has given second landlords the opportunity to "profiteer"! Taking my residence as an example: the second landlord has already increased the rent to us third tenants in a profiteering manner by taking advantage of the Municipal Council's tax increase. The donations and taxes that the Municipal Council adds to the second landlord are about 10 yuan "per quarter," but the second landlord adds more than 10 yuan "per month" to us third tenants!</p>
<p>Although the Municipal Council has been "paying attention" to the "profiteering" of second landlords, it has not yet announced concrete measures. I dare to represent the opinions of the majority of citizens in Shanghai in this bold way and propose my opinions to the Municipal Council and the Board of Directors, namely:</p>
<p>— Starting from today, start investigating the rent paid by each third tenant to the second landlord, and those with excessive "profiteering" should be severely punished!</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Case</p>
<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Conflicting Information</p>
<p>Hawthorne's father asked, "Why? Isn't the main gate locked every night?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's locked, and I mostly lock it, unless Miss Wang comes back too late, then she locks it herself. She also has the key to the main gate. But last night I saw Miss Wang still in the guest room, the guests hadn't left yet, so I didn't lock it."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou clearly heard an important clue and couldn't stand the silence anymore. He put down his pen, straightened up, and excitedly interjected, "Guests? How many? Who?"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou's series of questions full of fervent hope only earned him an old man's rat-like eyes, a shake of his head, and the continuous phrase: "I don't know."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou suddenly said furiously, "What don't you know? One moment you say there were guests, the next you say you don't know? Are you trying to be difficult in front of us?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne, seeing this situation unfold again, took the paper from his mouth and took the opportunity to wave his hand at Ni Jinshou.</p>
<p>He asked, "Old Mao, explain yourself clearly. How do you know Miss Wang had guests at that time?"</p>
<p>Old Mao replied, "When I entered the gate, I looked at this window. The light inside was very bright, but the curtains were fully drawn. I couldn't see anything, but I heard voices inside, so I naturally guessed there were guests."</p>
<p>"Did you hear anything being said?"</p>
<p>"No, I only heard one man's voice and Miss Wang's. They weren't speaking loudly, and the rain was heavy, and I was also dizzy, so I didn't listen carefully."</p>
<p>"Although you couldn't hear what they were saying clearly, you might have been able to tell whose voice the man was?"</p>
<p>Old Mao wiped his forehead again and shook his head, saying, "I couldn't tell. When I was quietly closing the gate, I heard the man's laughter a little louder, but I couldn't recognize who it was."</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou couldn't help but interject again, "Could it have been Yu Gantang?"</p>
<p>Old Mao glanced at the chief detective hesitantly and said, "I wouldn't dare say for sure—I don't think it sounded like him. I don't think he and Miss Wang have had a quarrel, and they wouldn't be able to laugh when they met." (52)</p>
<h3>The Origin of Medicine Residue</h3>
<p>— Wang Cangping</p>
<p>When I was young, I read a notebook that talked about medicine residue being poured on the road. Because the family of the sick person was deeply afraid that the doctor's prescription was wrong, they poured the medicine residue on the road so that passing doctors could examine it in detail and then ask about the patient's condition to determine whether the previous doctor's medication was appropriate. In the past, doctors mostly had a heart to help the world, so their actions were similar to ascetic monks, treating people's illnesses everywhere. Pouring medicine residue in front of the door could also serve as a marker that the family had a sick person. Therefore, people in the past called doctors "traveling doctors." Compared to the doctors of today, I can't help but feel the difference between past and present.</p>
<h3>Opportunity and Fate</h3>
<p>— Ping Ping</p>
<p>A few months ago, a relative made some speculative wealth. For a time, they rode in cars, frequented dance halls, and the "young master" came out with a "big sister" as a follower, counting three of them. They were truly arrogant. Among relatives and friends, everyone had to give them a second glance, hoping that they could make eye contact with this noble person for just a moment, exchanging a fake smile, which would feel extremely glorious. So, people often praised that their appearance was extraordinary, and now that the opportunity had arrived, how could they not prosper?</p>
<p>A few months later, relatives and friends are spreading the news: "So-and-so has now lost money on speculation, and the car has been sold." Then someone says that their timing was bad and their luck has turned.</p>
<p>People entrust their lives to opportunity and fate, which they cannot see with their eyes or touch with their hands. They never consider the "facts that are placed before their eyes." Speculators who are able to "snatch" a lot of money are certainly qualified to have a lot of money snatched from them. And they stubbornly say: the timing and fate are not right.</p>
<p>We must know that there is no such thing as opportunity and fate in the world. You get what you pay for.</p>
