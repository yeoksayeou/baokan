<h3>日機分批襲川　瀘州夷為平地　渝市預防傘兵降陸　並設立情報傳遞站</h3>

<p>重慶　渝市各處今晨開始堆置沙袋、並裝設鐵絲網、某某觀察家以為此項工事、係防日本降落傘隊企圖在渝市降陸、或以詢諸軍事委員會發言人、據答稱、此事僅係渝市駐軍舉行演習、（十六日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>重慶　據率領戰鬥機保衛渝市之鄭紹禹（譯音）隊長語人、重慶上空之空戰、現正發展成為「上升之比賽」、當日機第一次空襲渝市時、飛行高度為四千米突、中國戰鬥機則在四千五百米之高度、加以攻擊、其後日機之高度逐見增高、目前中國戰鬥機、已在七千米突之高空、靜候突擊矣、在此高度、駕駛員必須應用養氣、因氣溫極低、需非常強壯之體魄、有支持此種狀況、吾人不知此種升高比賽將至何時為止、日轟炸機目前空襲時、採用密集V字隊形、以免中國戰鬥機之攻擊、有時九十架轟炸機結成一大隊而來、以期用其聯合之火力、使中國戰鬥機不能接近、（十六日路透社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>泛論上海社會之罪惡</h3>
<p>上海社會之刦掠殺傷事件，殆日必數起乃至十百起，徒以不盡鳴之官，不盡刋之報，故莫得而稱述其可驚之確數。即如愴殺與綁票，其案情重大至不能隱蔽者，自七月迄今，僅一月有半，報章所揭載，旣三十餘起。此以純粹的客觀、加以賅括的斷案，謂非社會病態，謂非人羣罪惡，不可得也。請從而泛論之。</p>
<p>夫社會之榮枯盛衰，人羣之安危利害，凡屬生息於其間者，實相共之，無得自外。蓋就表面而言，我爲我，爾爲爾，各自爲家，各奉一天，若不相涉也者；就環境而言，形成此環境爲人人，而人人復爲此環境所支配。然生息於此環境之內，人與人間，應如何相處，則未可舉以歸之環境，而實存其人之意識。世人今日之所以相尋相仇乃至相殺相害無已時者，大多由於怨忿而竟無術節制；殺機一動，遂致因果相伏：及其動盪之不已，使循良守分之輩，慄慄自危；强梁之徒，更蠢蠢思動；流風所被，蓋如堤防一壞，收拾自有不易言者。至此則無論其爲種因，爲受因，凡屬同此社會，同此人羣，悉爲恐怖所籠罩矣。</p>
<p>欲措治安於磐固，弭巨患於無形，地方有職者之責也。至若經濟上之原因，此有彼無，明爭暗奪，則人羣宜共分其責者也。竊以爲上海社會，自戰後畸形繁榮，投機盛行，物價飛漲，富者愈富，貧者愈貧，識者固早知其有自蒙其殃之一日，今則中產之家，掙扎於生活困境中，將瀕於無產。無產者雖勞苦終日，仍至食不飽，衣不溫，而無立錐之地。彼發國難財者，不顧一切，攘人之有，度其豪奢之享用，居則華厦，行則汽車，衣則綺羅，，食則珍饈，遂使桀驚生心，貧寒興嗟；獨不念象召焚身，正爲有齒，匹夫無罪，懷璧其罪；雖有物質之可傲，詎免精神之憂患。夫處共同之社會，而不顧共同之禍福，處危慕之上，而自欺爲財力萬能，此其所見，誠井底蛙之不若耳。上海工商業前途，危道正多；促成一般生活艱難之物價步漲，及今已臻飽和點。去年物價有漲無跌；而今年物價，或漲或跌；至未來之物價，如時局澄淸，運輸通暢，勢必有跌而無漲。夫有漲無跌，則當然盈利，雖期年而十百千萬，亦無足奇。及至或漲或跌，則有盈有虧、而其爲盈虧，復非一己之財力智力所得而趨避矣。若至有跌無漲，則其時工商業，有如出峽扁舟，一瀉千里，不知所屆。、若投機居奇者之傾家蕩產不足恤，然工商業有總崩潰之危，至少亦將以多數之破產與失業而使整個社會蒙其無法補苴之酷烈影響。試思其時之社會恐怖爲何如？</p>
<p>原近頃之恐怖，不盡由於經濟性質；然試轉輾推求，可謂無不有經濟因素存乎其間。是以爲消弭恐怖最善之辦法，莫如調節物價，使生活稍紓，一般道德稍恢復。禁暴利，禁淫靡，以冀减少凡由怨忿覬覦而釀成之罪惡。其生財有道，正常致富者，亦應知惟能散財濟衆者，方爲守富之善道；應如何斥資奉公，使生活艱難者得有蘇生之機會，對於職位卑於我生活艱於我者，務必予以實惠之同情，以互助精神，維持其最低，而必需之生活。夫如是？聲應氣感，化暴戾爲祥和，雖不能必恐怖之盡得消弭，而潛移默化，要亦不難收效於無形也。</p>

<h3>防軍決數昨公表　中區歸美軍接防　工部局董事會決議接受　傳下星期六卽實行接管</h3>
<p>前日在工部局舉行之各國防軍司令會議之結果、因其維繫中外市民利益甚鉅、萬目睽睽、竚延佳音、後該項關係重大之決議案、卒於昨晨九時正式揭曉、關於英防軍撤離後之接替問題、決定前由英西福資高地隊防守之公共租界中央區及虹口西區、改由美海軍第四聯隊接防、而原由東旭萊隊防守之公共租界西區、則由日本陸戰隊防守、聞兩軍將同時於本月二十四開始接防、消息傳出、各方均表欣慰、惟日方對此、似有深憾、據其宣稱、該防軍司令委員會所通過之決議、將於英軍移交前、重付討論、衆信防軍司令會議如再度召集、其日期當在英軍離滬之前、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>防區支配　昨晨公表</p>
<p>工部局情報室、於八月十六日、發表上海各國防軍委員會致上海工部局總董之函件如下、「八月十五日星期日、各國防軍司令舉行會議、由多數票決通過下列建議、「凡現由英軍防守之丁區部份、交由日軍接防、凡現由英軍防守之乙區部份、交由美軍接防、日本委員對於上項建議、投票反對、並保留向防軍委員會另提計劃之權利、意國委員未曾投票、查上述議案、自須待由工部局及有關各國政府之核准、</p>
<p>本委員會一致同意、對於上述種種不得於八月十六日上午九時以前公佈、請閣下在該時間以前、對於上項決議保守秘密爲荷、</p>
<p>（註）現由英軍担仟防守之丁區部分、其界綫約如下、自蘇州河起、至虹橋路口之鐵道路綫轉陸家宅路·海格路·極司非爾路·開納路。由開納路·億定盤路·之交叉點、向西北作直綫、通至蘇州河、（極司非爾路口）再沿蘇州河西至鐵道路綫止、乙區界綫、南自愛多亞路起、北至界路止、其西爲虞洽卿路·北西藏路、東自外灘經蘇州河轉北河南路至界路口止、」</p>
<p>此舉增高　華人興奮</p>
<p>路透社十六日紐約電、據非官塲消息、駐滬外國防軍司令開會議決、公共租界駐紮之英軍撤退後、界內之大部份、將由美國海軍陸戰隊接防、紐約通報今晨社論批評此事、謂日本軍閥久抱一種見解、以爲日軍僅須得入公共租界威嚇西人或華人、卽能使全中國感覺日人已被認爲遠東主人、則擊破華人抗戰志願、更屬易易、故今聞此消息、必爲憤懣無疑、職是之故、此舉實爲日本在外交上敗於美國之手、而可减輕英國威望之墮落、及大足增高華人之興奮、</p>
<p>局方開特　董會通過</p>
<p>公共租界工部局、於昨日上午九時、爲防軍會議中所決議之接防辦法問題、特召集董事會臨時特別會議、至上午十一時十五分始行散會、昨日上午出席此董事會特別會議者、計有總董凱自威·美總董卡納·華董虞洽卿·袁履登奚玉書郭順·英董赫蘭·麥道南·鮑威爾·米基爾·美董阿樂滿·日董碻雄·岡本一策、缺席者爲華董江一平、列席者有工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥·副總辦葛勃·華副總辦何德奎·情報室主任納許等四人、首由工部局總辦費利溥報吿防軍會議所決定之接防辦法、提付討論、當時總董及英董四人、與副總董及美董阿樂滿、均表示贊成、日董碻雄及岡本則反對、華董四人、對美防軍接防中區及北區一點、亦表贊成、最後則投票表決、結果英董五人及美董二人投贊同票、華董四人因西區讓由日軍接防、一致棄權不投票、日董二人則投反對票、但已七對二票而獲得完全通過矣</p>
<p>發表文告　補充意見</p>
<p>工部局情報室昨發表正式文吿云、本局曾接自防軍聯合委員會之本月十五日來函一件、十六日上午十時、本局開特別會議時、將該函提出考量、防軍聯合委員會多數建議、現由英軍駐防之「乙」防區、應交與美軍接防、現由英軍駐防之一部份「丁」防區、應交與日軍接防、當經決定通知該委員會、贊同此項建議、但因知防軍聯合委員會之日籍委員、曾保留提出其他計劃之權、因此本局又決定通知該委員會、倘將來另有建議提出、並經該會及時通知本局、而使能在英軍自「乙」及「丁」防區撤退之前、從事安排、本局亦保留將該項建議詳細考量之權、</p>
<p>分別呈報政府核准</p>
<p>又據外交界方面所知、前日防軍會議通過之建議、已由英·美義·日四國委員、分別呈報各該政府核准、據悉、英美兩國方面、當於前日會議散後一小時、卽已分別電吿華盛頓及倫敦各本國政府、</p>
<p>傳下週六　開始接防</p>

<p>義軍司令　放棄投票</p>

<p>日方或將　另提計劃</p>
<p>該項會議表決後、日司令武田、對於建議聲明保留向防軍委員會另提計劃之權利、據關係方面所知、日方或將於日內另提出所謂計　故此項會議、日內或將再度舉行、亦未可知、其日期當在英國防軍尙未離滬撤防之前、惟衆信日方雖聲明保留另提計劃之權利、但不足動搖或變更前日會議所通過之議案、</p>

<h3>金市不穩</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况立足不穩、滙市鬆平、欲升無力、卒吿下挫、惟人心並不頽唐、祇缺乏勇氣搜扒、致跌時少人維持、晨初尙爲五千八百十元、某金號首來塞小至五千七百九十元、後錢兌業銀號扒入復達五千八百十元、然金號幫再來猛吐、且銀號反見塞出、時買者極少、慘降至五千七百六十元、午收前幸某金號獲利補空、且賴斯時滙市回軟、漸漸拉起三四十元、午收爲五千七百八十二元、後市爲狀更疲、而五千七百七十五元開盤、曾微漲數元、終以外滙仍硬、銀號錢兌業聯袂拋出、退爲五千七百七十元、晚收祇五千七百七十二元、較上日軋小三十五元、全天交易約二十餘兩、銀樓飾金掛小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>粭赤跌卅五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初以人心尙佳、市勢穩平、首由錢兌業出金號一十兩、爲五千八百十元、比上日微升三元、　因金號幫吐賣、立撳二十元銀鐵號出錢兌業二十兩、爲五千七百九十元、旋賴某錢兌業及銀號扒進、復又拉達五千八百十元高盤、奈金號幫賣意尙濃、且錢兌業及銀號亦傾向吐出、竟一度退至五千七百六十元低價、惟不久賣者漸减、且某錢兌業及某金號獲利補空、而滙市亦吿回緊、故收盤前再見五千八百元、惟外滙重吿鬆平、因價難以拉提、迨收市父退五千七百八十二元、午後初開金號賣出略撳七元、金號出銀號二十兩、爲五千七百七十五元、嗣賴證券幫錢兌業吸收、會抬至五千七百八十三元、但銀號一再拋賣、而斯時某錢兌業亦來跟塞、遂壓小至五千七百七十元、惟晚收爲五千七百七十二元、結果比上日劇小三十五元、全天五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進减低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸六百元、迨十時二十分掛小十元、此後則無變動、計大同行改懸五百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>現鈔充裕　貼現猛降十元</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、跌勢突銳、乃現鈔近來大見充裕、每千元上午貼進已退至四十元、貼出四十二元、下午貼進竟在落至僅三十一元、貼出亦祗三十三元、比上日猛低十元、錢業公會拆息復小一分、早午兩市均掛一角四分云、</p>
<h3>證劵　防軍問題解決　內債興奮</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况起伏頗鉅、初以救國公債付息有停止三年之謠而跌、繼以本市防區問題已經妥善解決而漲、貼水行市忽然大跌、由四十六跌至二十九元內、公債市塲、各戶適有較大淮胃、人心乃愈見奮興、午前所跌、午後所漲、有過之無不及、昨日午前初開、僅爲仁昌鴻康聯益買進不少、故開價甚堅、恒孚頗有供給、旋以同康鴻大永祥中一賣出而漸疲、聯和出籠尤湧、甲種打破六十元、丙戊兩種亦破入五十元關、午後初開恒孚忽有買進、爲數較鉅、恒康繼之淮量亦不弱、於是鴻大抵補、聯益仁昌加碼、信孚順泰跟進、同康中一繼續賣出、震康通記益昌大豐亦紛紛供出、但市價　已扶搖直上、結果比上日、甲乙丙尙漲二三角、餘平定成交、總數共計的一百卅萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股二百股、價爲五元九角五分、</p>
<p>倫敦十五日（週四）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、債市平靜、股市微有起落、匯豐銀行股各升一鎊半、英倫註册股爲六十二鎊半、香港註册股爲六十八鎊半、古拉客林傍橡皮股則跌落六便士、價爲十三先令九便士、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米回漲</h3>
<p>昨日洋米市忽轉緊、良以前朝一跌、突又引起補空之風、一時盲從附和者絡繹不絕、形勢殊栗落、嗣後再經內地幫及本鄉店戶暢辦、各貨行情、遂在客販扳佾聲中、已提一元有奇、直迨近午、銷塲轉懈、且有獲利者乘高出籠、方見市色稍挫、略呈帶軟、然其收盤價猶較前市見增半元至近元耳、計一號陳西貢爲五十八元、</p>
<p>洋米昨因租界解嚴、本市實銷略有問津、且以連日步跌後、貨方亦不肯再度賤脫、而內地幫鄉莊浮囤亦略有趁平吸收、因此市面漸見轉好、至於同籠原包旣乏原根收補、亦無大戶吸收、客幫與囤戶均少顧問、統市祇浮戶稍有出入、總計成交祇一百多噸、故在現洋米回振七八角至元許時、而原包祇跟好三四角而已、二號西貢早市尙被多頭抑小至六十一元半、旋回至六十二元半、二號暹邏亦開六十二元半、轉棧連費者則爲六十四元云、</p>
<p>粳糯國米雖到貨依然不旺、共祇七八百包、但無論明暗市交易，傳聞均仍不暢、致價難能與洋米並駕齊驅、無甚榮辱、常幫鮮淸粳猶爲六十六七元、無錫淸粳六十五元半、六十五元、常州蘇崑粳高自六十四元左右、次之六十二三元、宿六十元上下、南港原包早稻六十二元半、六十一元半、斛見五十九元半、五十八元半、燕尖四十八元、國糯市乏高貨、僅金溧大市元、開出六十一元、六十元零七角、常丹白元五十八九元、香港特元五十九元半、五十九元、大市五十七八元、次五十五五元、砶元五十一二元左右、周浦新粳來源漸夥、昨有四五十石、高竹缺乏、中關者居多，、所以市色似緊而價開六上一元、</p>
<h3>粉業垂絕　福新停工已三日</h3>
<p>華北民衆慣食麵粉、故每年麵粉北運、其數較米多數倍、但目七七事變以來、華北首先淪陷、致糧食均遭統制、本市福新·阜豐等廠粉、停止北運已久、現所運往者、均係日商「三鑫廠出品、該三鑫廠原係福新三廠、被佔之後、改爲日商三鑫、該廠今日有麵粉一萬一千包運往威海衛、七千包運往靑島、係裝日輪台中丸運往、並有苞米八百包運威海衛、又聞上星期一有二萬四千包裝海平輪運津、（祖）</p>
<p>麵紛以福新停車已三日、非有原料接濟、不能開車、阜豐尙有少數存麥、照舊開車、惟目下粉市塲、早被日粉所霸佔、聞鳳凰牌初開尙平、旋以客囤問津、收買九月份期貨頗殷、價遂冉冉上升、計開本月份十四元六角至七角、九月份十四元由七角八角至八角半、成交三千餘包、洋粉及內地紛交易暫靜、華粉廠盤仍爲十五元、由　豐批出三千餘包、</p>
<p>小麥昨日平淡如故、華廠以運輸被阻、無法暢收、日廠進胃尙濃、而吃盤則尤重視、故市價仍在二十元有奇、中次　別不一、由三鑫廠收進三千五六百包、聞華廠收價須二十二元三四角、爲數不過四五十包與一二百包、市面開展、恐尙有待也、</p>
<h3>中國蠺絲業之刷新</h3>
<p>— 德</p>
<p>（丙）改良之情形</p>
<p>我國蠶絲業改良之嘗試，係由爲此目的所創立之國際貿易委員會施行之。卽先由日本輸人中國系白繭種——此係日本輸入中國種，而加以改良之，故名——藉以產生無遺傳病害之標準蠶種。此等之品種，概使白繭一化性與白繭二化性相交雜也。該委員會爲謀本事業之得趨於良好起見，更派遣宣傳員分赴各地指導養蠶之改良方法，作養蠶家之啟蒙運動，如斯，本事業自有優良之成績矣。惟多數養蠶家所產出之蠶絲，尙極粗大，又更缺乏淸楚之程度，故叩種上，仍無如何成效。</p>
<p>去年，全國經濟委員會爲適應環境之需要，遂行創立蠶絲改善委員會，考究其弊害之所在。該委員會去年更在四川省會成都設立一實騐所，施以種種之試騐，特別探求與歐洲種交雜之結果，其試騐上必需之蠶，殆包含全體種類，此係由全國所徵集也，但成都之實騐所，在實施特別作成之計畫上，尙缺充分之設備，故更在行都重慶設立試騐所以補助之。</p>
<p>此行都新試騐所之工作，早已開始。其目的自然在希圖產出蠶之改良種。故收集約二千五百瓩之蠶，其中一半爲廣東種，四川種；若由最近兩年之經騐推之，其改良似有長足之進展。</p>
<p>至於重慶試騐所之實騐綱領，則如下述。</p>
<p>（子）一化性</p>
<p>（一）一九三九年及一九三八年秋所產出之絲，殆爲品質不良之縐綢，故宜使若干中國系白繭種重新交雜，並精選其分雜及變化。</p>
<p>（二）使中國系白繭一化性及多化性與歐洲系交雜。</p>
<p>（三）爲大規模試騐白交雜種起見，將其種供給養蠶家。</p>
<p>（四）不論細毛之有無，應繼續育成純粹及交雜之白繭一化性及有色一化性。</p>
<p>（五）改善有色之湖北種。</p>
<p>（六）調査並選擇所收集之新自繭種。</p>
<p>（七）改善一九三九年所收集之北部及西部之黃·桃色等種。</p>
<p>（八）將我國西部及北部之白蘭種與歐洲之白繭種交雜之。</p>
<p>（九）交雜白繭種與中部之白繭種。</p>
<p>（十）以分雜，交雜之方法，固定新繭。</p>
<p>（丑）廣東之多化性</p>
<p>（一）繼續改良廣東白　種之多化性</p>
<p>（二）將一九三九年所獲得之純交雜種，變化爲二化性或一化性。</p>
<p>（三）注意若干製絲地方採用春·夏·秋蠶之純種。</p>
<p>此外，對於桑葉之決定，亦費去種種之實騐。關於新改良種之飼育期間，桑葉消費額，蠶絲製出額，皆有精密之調査，最後爲指導鄉村之養蠶家，養成蠶種製造業者起見，更已開始訓練宣傳員及指導者矣</p>
<p>觀上所述，我國蠶絲業若能循序漸進，則將來之希望，實未可限量也。（完）</p>
<h3>雜糧箝制　愈形尖銳</h3>
<p>本埠雜糧供應、因處孤島、受人箝制、故到貨斷續不常、市况起伏頗大、邇來統制情形，益形尖銳、以致來源不接、存貨日枯、大局漸抽漸緊、各種市價、無不漲、近以蠶豆又被日商吸收、上身貨衝出二十元大關、昨吳江靑蠶已開自一十一元至十九元五角、成交一千餘包、北港毛家市靑蠶爲二十元零七角至五角、成交四百包、嘉定白蠶五百包、價爲二十元、崇明沙蠶百許包、十七元五角、黃豆雖尸見新、但後批不接、故潛勢有漲無跌、昨做開安慶豆五百包、價詳市價欄、蕪湖豆百餘包、桑園豆二百包、浦東杜豆三百餘包、其餘大連豆靑島豆等均在暗中交易、刻下去路仍爲南洋本街二幫云、</p>
<p>豆子十七日運香港一千九白九十包、運新加坡七百三十包、</p>
<h3>糖市　轉口粗白　廣幫進二千包</h3>
<p>昨糖市因廣幫吸收轉口二四粗白二千包、趨勢頗覺堅緊、公會劃盤現貨二四粗白本棧七十二元七角至七十三元、升六角、外棧新貨七十二元半、老貨七十二元、升三角、轉口貨二十二日交割五十六元八角至五十七元半、升二角、二十九日交貨五十八元、廣幫獨進二千包、荷棉白KD嘜七十二元一角、升一角、荷赤　嘜五十九元八角至六十元、升六角、太古車白無甚上落、B嘜七十五元三角、DY嘜七十二元六角、HX嘜七十二元、H嘜車赤微鬆、爲五十八元一角、國糖有廣幫開出東鄕赤一百十八包、五十八元半、花油包又二百件、五十二元、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉紗存貨　有進無退　雙馬最小八七二元</h3>
<p>紗市始跌繼漲、趣勢稍見安定、同時香港帮採辦、聞有一千四百包外、多頭心意轉爲振作、但據云該帮亦含投機性質、（內慕究屬如何、尙不得而知也、）總之兩日以來、下跌殊巨、在百元以外、新買者又膽壯而活動、不過存紗仍在有進無退中、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因人心不佳、搶帽子輩、一律拋賣、所以情勢軟化、二十支雙馬價爲八八百八十元、跌至七十二元、在八十元外盤旋、爲時甚久、旋聞傳說上海防區問題、經五國會議後、事態和平解決、由此人心大爲震盪、空頭粉紛抵補、市盤乃逐步前進、直漲至九百十四元收盤、以後稍挫、査半日間成交三千五百十包、行情二十支雙馬跌十元零五角、今日有棉紗七百七十五件運香港、一百五十件運海口、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　二、〇三〇</p>
<p>內地　三〇</p>
<p>香港　一四五〇</p>
<p>統計　三、五二〇</p>
<h3>棉市疲憊如故</h3>
<p>現棉成交殊爲呆滯、廠家需要甚淸、至於同行中鑒於紗市希望不大、對於互相買賣興趣淡然、所以市面又入趦趄之象、行情依然疲憊不振、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉市價、紐約棉市、市况堅定、後且形活躍異常、現貨交易亦稍形轉好、一部份空頭抵補、結果收盤價格、較之上日略漲一二磅音、印度連同預測漲二羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日因防軍會議、結果尙稱滿意、因之人心忽轉鎭定、紗價亦見回好、故棉市市况又轉堅定、昨日交易雖見靜寂、然同業心思又好矣、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布至午　採辦轉旺</h3>
<p>布市晨疲午堅、首以承上日頽勢、浮戶爭先出籠、買戶觀望、跌風頗劇、惟近午防軍會議結果發表、人心轉定、本街客幫實需各戶、卽落手採辦、市氣轉堅、結果市盤較上日每疋廉一角至二角半、本街成交五百餘件、浙幫辦色布·色斜·粗布一百餘件、粵港幫辦斜紋·色布一百五六十件、西安幫辦印花·直貢等一千餘疋、新加坡等地辦漂染布五千餘疋、</p>
<p>東布晨市因津幫賣出、繼續下跌、龍頭細布降至三十元零四角、四君子嗶嘰跌見八角七分半、後市本街同業捕空、售盤逐漸拉高、龍頭收盤回升至三十元零六角半、嗶嘰八角九分、與前日比例、細布每疋又跌五角左右、</p>
<p>十七日疋頭出口、九百件運烟台、四十件運天津、五百九上五件運香港、三十八件運新加坡、五十件運海門、</p>
<h3>藥材　新百合片已到</h3>
<p>新百合片昨有續到一批、因產價步緊、成本愈高、當已見樣、色澤尙佳、惟身份較軟、行盤叫升十元、尙乏成交、大的今日方有正市云、</p>
<h3>五金　洋釘盤元略昂</h3>
<p>五金市况日來略覺熱鬧、蓋外埠客幫生意蠢動、本街廠家鬥莊亦時有買賣、故市塲空氣尙佳、業中人心思隨秀、各項貨價均稍振作、洋釘與盤元遂亦帶好、査盤元爲製釘之原料、故盤元之上落大多隨洋釘為漲跌、昔時洋釘因越南與南洋羣島斷銷、本市趨勢衰頽、同時盤元喊價亦一落千丈、最近雖南銷未見通暢、惟天津幫與內地客商却時有搜辦、故行情較前略昂、每桶倍司四十八元、盤元亦升至四十八元一担、</p>

<h3>績琵琶行並序</h3>
<p>徐玉珍，原名朱麗卿，滬上歌妓之翹楚也。乙亥秋，歸湖州楊氏，遭大婦悍妒，其夫亦不善調停，結褵四年，鬰鬰不得志。去年秋，聞母病，返棹琴川，旋因母死，携去衣飾，盡爲其戚某等攘去；訟於官，不得直。閒關來滬，尋其夫，夫不理焉；時囊資已罄，無所因依，不得已乃易今各，仍理故業。嗟乎！琵琶一曲，淚盈覊客靑衫；絲竹重調，仍是當年紅袖。因悲共遇，賦長歌以紀之。</p>
<p>申江本是烟花藪，秋菊春蘭齊競秀；歲歲尋芳興不窮，章台處處皆垂柳。朱家有女最淸絕，玉貌如花膚如雪；妝好常嫌脂粉汚，歌罷直叫金石裂。好花墜溷本非宜，春檻旋從金谷移；敢說商人皆重利，由來美女總情痴。翩翩裙屐楊家子，情深竟欲因情死；兩情相眷便相從，舞扇歌裙棄如屣。　溪一水本非遐，金屋堪居解語花；誰知忽蹙妬律浪，獅王怒吼風生沙。季常擲杖心無主，雄威不敵胭脂虎；欲爲左袒愧無能，妬花一任風和雨，</p>

<h3>以視代聽</h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>在器官不健全的人們中，除去啞子與盲子外，聾子也是十分痛苦的人；他們幾乎與這個世界隔絕得很遠，祇能在心理上體會外界的一切。動聽的音樂，友人的聲調，以及其他悅耳的聲音，他們從沒有福分享受，這眞是如何不幸的事！</p>
<p>在一八九一年當Edward　B．Nitchie十五歲的時候，他兩耳失去聽覺，他頗有自殺的意念，但接着，他決定要好好地活下去。不久之後，由於努力硏究的結果，被他發現以口脣的動作及面部表情作爲聾子與非聾子傳達言語的要素。聾子能够在經過一番訓練以後，不但可以談笑自如，而且他人的言語也都完全可以了解。愛德華氏的這一種」讀脣法」（Lip　Reading）收效頗宏，旣簡單又有趣，很小的孩子也可以一目瞭然，因此大受人們歡迎，遂籌資開辦一所學校，這學校漸漸進展，成爲今日的紐約聯合會（New　York　League）二十五年來堪稱是「讀脣法」的總發源地，影響所及，除全美外，加拿大，南美洲及歐洲的一部分也都已有了敎授讀脣的學校。</p>
<p>在全美三百萬兒童中，曾於一九三四年有一百萬兒童受過集體的聽覺測騐，結果發現有八萬個兒童的聽覺較常人爲劣。內中一萬個兒童須經過聲藥的治理，九千個兒童聽覺幾已完全失去，必須受讀脣的訓練。</p>
<p>敎授讀脣的敎員對學生講話時並無聲音，不過像平常一樣，兩爿嘴脣自然地移動，旣不過快，也不太慢。敎員起先在黑板上寫些Sing，Wing，Ring，Say，Way，Ray，Seed，Weed，Reed，等字，敎員先無聲地念一遍，學生們跟着大聲地朗讀。或敎員講述一隻故事，除把繁難的生字寫在黑板上外，並無聲地發一問，學生們却常能大聲地回答一他，道種訓練工作，漸漸由簡一而繁，使與日常談話相近。</p>
<p>不過讀脣有一種顯著的困一難，便是平日會話中，有百分之五十五的字句常發自齒隙或喉端或鼻底，因此眼睛的使用，也須特別靈敏，精密的思想務必緊跟在眼睛之後。</p>
<p>由於言語繁複萬端的緣故，凡到聯合會受學的人，常須有一個對象，例如做一個百貨店的職員與做一個寫字間的辦事員，兩者所學的截然不同。這種讀脣法頗有成效，在美國已經有不少商店僱用聾的職員，能力與常人一無兩樣。</p>
<p>現代科學昌明，人們的福利也已大大地增加，中國的許多聾子，恐怕仍舊與這個世界隔絕，那麼提倡讀脣似乎是急不容緩的事了！</p>

<p>— 吳緘三</p>
<p>對於社會上的一魁閎豪傑之士」，我最憎惡兩種虛有其表的角色：功利主議者和風頭主義者。風頭主義者旨在盜名欺世，一輩子也拿不出眞實的貨色來；而功利主義者則更可鄙，心目中只知有「權勢」二字，蠅營狗苟，擯斥異已，往往都流爲人羣中的巨奸大猾，爲禍至烈。我向來所景仰者，是那種沉默苦幹的，不矜伐已功的，不汲汲於聞達的；苦難的中國，目下所迫切需要的，正就是這種人村。毀家興辦厦門大學和集美學校的陳嘉庚先生，卽其佼佼者之一。</p>
<p>陳先生係福建同安縣集美社人，僑商南洋，現在已是五十開外的老人了。他是中國的第二個武訓，這是誰都知道的；同時他又是一位最孚衆望的華僑領袖，抗戰軍興，他被推戴爲「南僑援助祖國抗戰大會」的主席，統率數十萬僑胞，爲國效忠，不遺餘力。今夏他和侯西反一羣人遠迢迢地由星洲飛渝，向最高領袖報吿海外僑情，並慰勞抗戰將士，有一班嘁喊嚓嚓的扯淡家，頗說了些閑話；其實幾口狗血，是噴不倒作爲艱貞之士的先生的。這純屬造謠中傷，他此行那裏有甚麼副作用？借用他常引以自謙的一句話來說：「兄弟只不過是盡國民一份子的職責罷了！」</p>
<p>荀子所謂一勞苦之事則爭先，饒樂之事則能讓，」眞正能做到這種地步的，世有幾人？我就僅見到一個先生而已。舉一個例：五六年前，有一位英國記者去訪問先生，盛譽先生手創厦大和集美兩校，孕育人材無數，貢獻國家至巨。但先生却淡淡地回答他說：「透是我們中國勞苦功高的敎育家們的收穫，兄弟只不過是盡國民一份子的職責罷了！」然而這却又絕不是僞善者的口頭禪可比，先生從來不標榜自己，只知有人羣。在英屬星洲，他擁有南洋商報和總匯新報，他並不把它們當作自己的私產看待，他未嘗誇張地製造過自己的消息。「我辦報的目的，只想爲僑胞服務，爲祖國宣傳抗戰。」他曾經道樣說過，到了現在，他的話是被證實了。</p>
<p>先生爲人端慤誠信，拘守而詳，待人接物，溫藹懇摯；一副　　儒者的風度，絲毫沒有「財豪」的臭氣味。不諳國語，僅能操厦門話，辭令也很樸拙。自幼習爲商賈，文事似非所長，據說他所有布露的文章和宣言，皆由其秘書捉刀。然而這些都無傷於先生的日月之明，他還不失是一位最切實際的崇高的人物！</p>
<h3>假母親</h3>
<p>— 大年</p>
<p>一八七〇年左右，當美國的婦女們剛才獨身乘火車出門的時候，她們很多都帶了一個束得很緊的假嬰兒，再不就帶個大而會叫的洋囡囡。這樣人家就以爲她們都是作母親的人了。她們不但可以很容易地尋到座位，同時那些孤寂的男乘客也可因此不致對她們再生別的野心。</p>
<h3>霍桑探案　舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青小著</p>
<p>我也急叫車夫停住，又叫他先掉一個方向，方才停車。我在付車錢的時候，我瞧見余甘棠頭也不回，一直走進一條弄裏去，分明他並不會覺察我的尾隨。我走到那弄口一瞧，那是昌明里一弄，裏面都是一上一下的石庫門住宅。這弄有相當寬度，也很淸靜，他沒有那些一宅屋子住上五六家人家的小里弄的嘈雜現象。</p>
<p>我瞧見余甘棠走到第三個石庫門口，並不敲門，直走進去，好像那門本來開着。我急急趕到那門口，果然是二號，那黑油的門，一扇關着，一扇開着一半。我把身子掩護在關着的一扇門外，略略探頭瞧到裏面。裏面是個客堂，佈置也相當整齊。有一個瘦長的少年男子，正在方桌上寫什麼東西。這人下身穿一條淺色的西裝褲，　上身穿一件淡藍白條紋的襯衫。這時他已擱了筆立起來，跟余甘棠招呼。</p>
<p>「甘棠，怎麽樣？」</p>
<p>「白走了一趟。跑了。」</p>
<p>「那也好，這倒是你的造化。你把那傢伙還我罷。」</p>
<p>「不，我總要找着他。……兆麒，你怎麽這樣小器。我用一粒算一粒錢好了。」</p>
<p>我祇把耳朶湊在門邊，爲謹愼起見，不敢向裏面瞧。不過從他們的談話上，我已很明顯，所謂「傢伙」，所謂「一粒」，分明手槍。這手槍大概是余甘棠向這個叫做兆麒的借用的，這時那叫樹兆麒的，發出一陣笑聲，又接着說話。</p>
<p>「甘棠，你誤會了。這不是錢的問題。我始終反對你的計劃，我覺得太不値得。」</p>
<p>（七八）</p>
<h3>吼聲</h3>
<p>— 徐翊</p>
<p>感謝一個友人的高誼，邀我同去看了一次馬戲。</p>
<p>當我們跨進了充滿着惡臭氣的塲園裏的時候，首先使我驚駭的，是那嘹亮的吼聲；吼聲裏似乎帶着憤怒，也似乎帶着憂　。原來「馬戲」是已經開演到最緊張的一募了。</p>
<p>携着一顆顫抖的心，倚着友人的肩背，我終於見到了生長在大自然中的獅虎。</p>
<p>（然而現在的獅虎，可還是在大自然中麼？）</p>
<p>張着飢餓的嘴，睜着烈燄般的眼睛，聲嘶力竭地抗拒着「馬戲家們的殘酷的玩弄。猛虎與雄獅終於捧着一顆永不屈服的心，向無知的人們發出來一聲聲憤怒的咆哮。</p>
<p>幾聲咆哮傳得了觀衆的歡心，人們都興味地笑了。</p>
<p>咆哮與歡笑，組織成了一個可怕的故事；這故事，含着太多的諷刺意味，針對着我顫抖的心靈刺來。</p>
<p>我受不住了這痛苦，我站了起來，哀求着好心的友人：</p>
<p>「我們走罷』。</p>

<h3>美國提倡道德片</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>性感明星聞風披靡</p>
<p>近年來好萊塢的性感影片，層出不窮，性感影星，爭奇鬥艷，雖爲一般低級趣味者所在棒，而在營業上確有相當收穫：但究竟爲社會上一般正義道德者所不齒，故而重整道德片運動，在美國醞釀已久，至今已具體地實現了。</p>
<p>道德片運動幹部，設在華盛頓，其促進人員，包括名流，學者，報人，牧師，在內，都以堅强不屈的精神聞名於時。計畫中第一部影片，名爲「醒醒吧，美國同胞。」聞該片內容，以排斥性感作風，尤其是「唔女郞」安秀麗丹爲宗旨。該片女主角人選，係在福羅利達洲奧都克微城所公開物色，名之曰，「超等美國小姐（Miss　Special），以視有別於普通掩耳盜鈴的小姐皇后之類，該片宗旨的純正，大有我國國片「孔夫子」的作風。</p>
<p>另一方面，脾睨一切的唔女郞安秀麗丹，聞得四面楚歌，行將成爲道學家們家矢之的，也亟圖在表面上改變作風，她主張不露大腿和身體的任何部份，使人無性感的藉口，故決計多演古裝片，如新片「禍水」（Calamity　Jane）中，她搖身一變而爲美國西北部古裝的騎士，自始至終，並未露出一寸肌膚。這就算得道德運動的力量，足以感化性感明星的一斑。</p>
<h3>梁賽珍南洋獲冠軍</h3>
<p>— 凌凌</p>
<p>我們記得，梁氏四姝在上海，給予一般人的印象是相當深刻的。她們姊妹四人：—賽珍，賽珠，賽珊，賽瑚，都從歌舞界中奮鬭着。尤其賽珍，具有很長的生命歷史，幹過電影工作，也曾當過彈性女兒，雖說不足留芳，遺臭却也不致於的。</p>
<p>戰爭的火錢在上海燃發，梁氏四姝，就離滬他往了，爲了生活，據說，仍舊在以色相來維持一家人。</p>
<p>最近，我們得到一個關於梁賽珍的消息，那倒頗有留芳的價値。</p>
<p>原來梁賽珍目前是在星加坡某大舞塲伴舞，因爲華僑大都對她發生良好的印象，所以每月權益很是可觀。於是，她也利用這點，組織星洲舞女協會，爲國內受傷兵士難胞演劇募藥，同時鼓勵各同業姊妹的好勝心，特以捐款多少作爲錦標的標準。結果，梁賽珍總以售券最多數，得獲全會的冠軍，其餘黃梅芳，朱飛媛兩人，則居於殿亞二軍的次位。</p>
<p>同胞們！她們是被人指爲醉生夢死者，尙且時時刻刻不忘祖國的戰士和民族，反觀今日的上海，却已暮氣沉沉，不知讀了這篇文字後，也能在本位上，幹點比較有意義的工作麽。</p>
<p>「雪地鏖兵」是第部描述蘇芬戰爭的影片。劇情十分緊張，用雪地爲背景，更是新穎特別，該片是環球影片公司出品，不日在大上海戲院作首輪公映。（上圖卽其一影）</p>

<h3>Strict Prevention of Japanese Army's Deceptive Infiltration: Chinese Troops Concentrated on the Guangxi-Yunnan Border. Japan Attempts to Attack Yunnan Province via Baise and Vietnam in a Pincer Movement, but Insufficient Current Troops, Reinforcements Needed for Offensive.</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - In an urgent attempt to end the China Incident, the Japanese army is concentrating in Longzhou, preparing to advance towards Baise, and then attack Yunnan from Baise. The Chinese military authorities in Chongqing and Guilin also anticipate that after the negotiations between Tokyo and Vichy are resolved, the Japanese army will launch a pincer attack on Yunnan Province by passing through Vietnam. Therefore, the Chinese army is also concentrating at the junction of Guangxi and Yunnan, and in various places near the Vietnamese border, to prepare for any eventuality. However, according to the opinions of foreign military experts, the terrain around Baise is not conducive to marching, and it is currently the rainy season. Therefore, the main force of the Japanese army must advance from Vietnam. The Baise area is full of high mountains and steep ridges, which is extremely unsuitable for mechanized warfare, and the difficulty of obtaining food is self-evident. According to news from Guilin, the current Japanese troops in Guangxi are the 5th Division and the 28th Division, as well as one division of the garrison army and other mixed units. The 28th Division defends the area near Nanning on the south bank of the Xijiang River, as well as the highway between Nanning and Longzhou. The 5th Division defends Longzhou, Ningming, and Zhennanguan, and dispatches some troops to garrison the area around Santang and Sitang on the northeast highway of Nanning. One division of the garrison army defends the highway between Nanning and Qinzhou to maintain the sea route. In addition, scattered mixed units are distributed in the east and south of Nanning. According to the opinions of military experts here, last Christmas, the Japanese army attacked Kunlun Pass with four divisions, but failed and retreated. The current Japanese troops in Guangxi are only sufficient for defense. They cannot attack Yunnan Province until a large number of reinforcements arrive. (16th International News Agency)</p>
<p>Liuzhou - The Chinese army has been sweeping the Shuikouguan, Luohuixiang, and other places west of Longzhou for days. The remnants of the Japanese army are collapsing towards Fengxiang and Longzhou. The Japanese army in Ping'erguan also suffered defeats and fled towards Fengxiang due to the Chinese army's attacks. The Chinese army is pursuing them in separate directions. There are currently no traces of the Japanese army west of Longzhou. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuzhou - The Chinese army on the Yongqin Road launched a surprise attack on the Japanese army in the suburbs of Qin County on the 9th, resulting in fierce fighting. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan - On the morning of the 11th, the Chinese army in Zengcheng, with agile movements, launched surprise attacks on the Japanese army in Guantang, Fuhe, Guanyintang, and other places. The soldiers rushed into the Japanese camps in the dim light and threw grenades fiercely. The Japanese army fled to the northwest highlands of Guantang. The Chinese army pursued closely, fighting fiercely until dawn. The Japanese army sent major reinforcements. The Chinese army fought back on the Aotou, Fengchi, and Dabuling lines. By noon, the Japanese army had been completely defeated by the Chinese army. In this battle, the Chinese army killed four to five hundred Japanese soldiers, injured two hundred, captured more than twenty loads of ammunition and weapons, and destroyed four Japanese tanks. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Binyang - On the morning of the 15th, a part of the Japanese army on the Yongqin Road harassed Nayue. After a head-on attack by the Chinese army, fighting was still ongoing at noon. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Training Young People and Women</h3>
<p>Shaoguan - In order to organize and train young people and women in Guangdong Province to participate in the war of resistance and national reconstruction, the Guangdong Provincial Government has instructed all counties, townships, and towns to organize youth groups and women's teams to provide extensive training.

Physical training, with equal emphasis on military and physical education, and imparting hygiene and nursing knowledge, with labor service and social service as the main focus. (15th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes in Multiple Waves Attack Sichuan, Luzhou Razed to the Ground, Chongqing Prepares for Paratrooper Landings, and Establishes Information Relay Stations</h3>
<p>Chongqing - This afternoon, about fifty Japanese planes in two waves attacked Luzhou, west of Chongqing. Another report stated that a total of three waves, ninety planes, participated in the bombing. An air raid alarm was issued here at 11:00 AM, as it was discovered that Japanese planes had entered Sichuan and were flying towards Chongqing. Chinese fighters patrolled the city's airspace. After circling in the western suburbs, the Japanese planes continued to fly west and attacked Luzhou. This area was bombed by 36 Japanese planes on August 12th, and machine-gunned. It is reported that as many as 3,000 people died tragically. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - At about 10:00 AM today, two waves of Japanese planes, a total of 54, were discovered in a certain area of Hubei, passing through Qianjiang, Pengshui, Hejiang, and other places, and invaded the airspace of Luxian at 12:45 PM, dropping more than 200 bombs, and then fled. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - An air raid alarm was issued in Chongqing this morning at 10:30 AM and lifted at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. According to reports from relevant parties, four waves of Japanese planes flew west from Hankou, entered Sichuan Province, and merged into two waves, taking the route south of Chongqing to Luxian to drop bombs. Afterwards, they returned east along the same route. Chinese planes were on alert near Chongqing. The situation of the encounter is not yet known. (16th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Sandbags are being piled up and barbed wire is being installed in various places in Chongqing this morning. Some observers believe that these works are to prevent Japanese paratroopers from attempting to land in Chongqing. When asked of the spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission, the reply was that this matter was only an exercise held by the Chongqing garrison. (16th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - In view of the fact that after the previous Japanese air raids on Chongqing, it was not easy to determine the bombed areas for a while, resulting in delayed rescue work, the Chinese authorities have established many information relay stations to remedy this. They use telephones to transmit information, with a total of five main lines and multiple branch lines, so that the bombed locations can be quickly reported in the event of an air raid, which is conducive to rescue work. (16th Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to the aviation industry, Luzhou, a small city located on the Yangtze River, 100 miles from Chongqing, is a gathering point for evacuating residents. As a result of the tragic bombing by Japanese planes at noon today, it has been razed to the ground. Luzhou is the end point of the Zigong Railway, with a population of no more than 100,000, but it is the center of evacuation for the people of Sichuan. Fifteen days ago, Luzhou was bombed by hundreds of Japanese incendiary bombs, causing 30 major fires. Because there were no modern water pipes and fire-fighting equipment, all human efforts could not extinguish the fires. After August 2nd, three-quarters of the city's buildings were reduced to rubble. More than a thousand corpses were found in the ashes of the burned houses, all of whom were burned to death. Today's air raid was a concentrated attack on the remaining undamaged parts. As a result, the densely populated Luzhou has been completely destroyed and become a desolate wilderness. (16th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to Captain Zheng Shaoyu (transliteration), who leads the fighter planes to defend Chongqing, the air battles over Chongqing are now developing into a "climbing competition." When Japanese planes first raided Chongqing, the altitude was 4,000 meters, and Chinese fighter planes attacked at an altitude of 4,500 meters. Afterwards, the altitude of Japanese planes gradually increased. Currently, Chinese fighter planes are waiting for attacks at an altitude of 7,000 meters. At this altitude, the pilots must use oxygen, because the temperature is extremely low, and they need a very strong physique to withstand this situation. We do not know when this climbing competition will end. Japanese bombers currently use dense V-shaped formations when attacking to avoid attacks by Chinese fighter planes. Sometimes 90 bombers form a large formation to use their combined firepower to prevent Chinese fighter planes from approaching. (16th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A General Discussion on the Evils of Shanghai Society</h3>
<p>Robberies, assaults, and killings in Shanghai society occur almost daily, even hundreds of times a day. They are simply not fully reported to the authorities or fully published in the newspapers, so it is impossible to accurately describe the shocking number. Even looking at assassinations and kidnappings, cases that are so serious that they cannot be concealed, there have been over thirty such cases reported in newspapers in the month and a half since July. This is a purely objective and comprehensive judgment, and it cannot be denied that it is a social malaise, a collective sin of the people. Please allow me to discuss it generally.</p>
<p>The prosperity and decline of a society, the safety and interests of the people, are shared by all who live within it; no one can stand apart. On the surface, it may seem that I am I, and you are you, each running our own household and following our own paths, with no connection to each other. However, in terms of the environment, this environment is formed by everyone, and everyone is in turn governed by this environment. However, how people should interact with each other within this environment cannot be attributed solely to the environment, but rather exists within the consciousness of the individual. The reason why people today seek each other out to hate, even to kill and harm without end, is largely due to resentment that cannot be restrained. Once the intent to kill is set in motion, it leads to a cycle of cause and effect. This relentless turmoil causes those who are virtuous and law-abiding to live in constant fear, while the strong and unruly are even more eager to take action. The influence of this trend is like a breach in a dam, and it is difficult to repair the damage. At this point, whether one is the cause or the recipient of the consequences, all who belong to this society, all who belong to this community, are shrouded in terror.</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of those in local authority to ensure lasting peace and stability and to prevent major disasters from taking shape. As for the economic causes, the have and have-nots, the open and covert struggles, this is a responsibility that the people should share. I believe that Shanghai society, since its abnormal post-war prosperity, rampant speculation, and soaring prices, with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, those who are knowledgeable have long known that there would be a day of suffering. Today, the middle class is struggling to survive and is on the verge of becoming propertyless. The propertyless, though working hard all day, are still unable to eat their fill or keep themselves warm, and have no place to stand. Those who make a fortune from the national crisis, disregard everything, seize the possessions of others, and live in extravagant luxury, living in mansions, traveling in cars, wearing fine clothes, and eating delicacies, causing envy and resentment among the poor and humble. Do they not remember that the elephant invites its own destruction by having tusks, and that the common man is not guilty, but is condemned for possessing valuables? Although they have material wealth to boast of, can they escape mental anguish? Living in a common society without regard for the common good, living on a precarious pile, and deluding themselves that financial power is omnipotent, their vision is indeed inferior to that of a frog in a well. The future of Shanghai's industry and commerce is fraught with danger. The rising prices that have led to general hardship have now reached saturation. Last year, prices only rose and did not fall, while this year, prices may rise or fall. As for future prices, if the situation clears up and transportation becomes smooth, prices will inevitably fall rather than rise. When prices only rise and do not fall, profits are naturally made, and even if they increase tenfold or a hundredfold over the years, it is not surprising. But when prices may rise or fall, there will be profits and losses, and these profits and losses cannot be avoided by one's own financial or intellectual power. If prices only fall and do not rise, then the industry and commerce at that time will be like a small boat leaving a gorge, rushing down a thousand miles, not knowing where it will end up. The bankruptcy of those who speculate and hoard may not be worth worrying about, but the danger of a general collapse of industry and commerce, or at least the widespread bankruptcies and unemployment, will have a devastating impact on the entire society that cannot be remedied. Imagine what the social terror will be like at that time?</p>
<p>The recent terror is not entirely due to economic factors, but if we examine it carefully, we can say that there is an economic factor involved in every case. Therefore, the best way to eliminate terror is to regulate prices, so that life is slightly easier and general morality is slightly restored. Prohibit profiteering and extravagance in the hope of reducing the crimes that are caused by resentment and covetousness. Those who make a legitimate living and become wealthy through proper channels should also know that only those who can share their wealth with the public are on the right path to preserving their wealth. They should consider how to invest in public services to provide opportunities for those who are struggling to survive, and they must show practical sympathy to those who are in lower positions than themselves and who are struggling more than themselves, and maintain their minimum and necessary living standards with a spirit of mutual assistance. If so, there will be a natural response, and violence can be transformed into peace and harmony. Although it may not be possible to completely eliminate terror, it is not difficult to achieve imperceptible results through gradual influence.</p>
<h3>The Executive Yuan Strictly Orders Crackdown on Hoarding and Speculation, Urging Respect for the Warning that Ill-Gotten Wealth is Ominous, and Avoiding the Punishment of Greedy Men Who Sacrifice Themselves for Wealth</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Regarding the crackdown on hoarding and speculation, the Executive Yuan meeting this week decided to implement it strictly. It is learned that the Executive Yuan has issued the following order: it has always been forbidden for unscrupulous merchants to monopolize and hoard. The people's livelihood requires a corresponding supply. No hoarding or speculation is allowed to disrupt the market. All control measures have been formulated and promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. There are also explicit provisions in the Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Extraordinary Times. The government is concerned about the people's livelihood and considers all aspects. It is doing its best to increase production and balance prices. Now, in the midst of national crisis, all our people should share the difficulties of the times, serve society, not forget the greater good for the sake of petty gains, and not hinder the public interest for the sake of selfish plans. They should all respect the warning that ill-gotten wealth is ominous, and avoid the punishment of greedy men who sacrifice themselves for wealth. After this warning, if there are any who disobey the law and hoard designated daily necessities, exceeding the limit, attempting to monopolize and speculate, and manipulate market prices, they will be punished to the fullest extent of the law once discovered, and there will be no leniency. In addition to issuing orders separately, the order is also to be forwarded to subordinates for compliance, and the public is to be informed. This order (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops on Chongming Island Strike Japanese</h3>

<h3>More Than a Thousand German Planes Continuously Bomb England - Fierce Air Battles with the British Air Force - Airport in London Suburbs Attacked for the First Time - Both Sides Claim to Have Shot Down Over a Hundred Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>London Yesterday was a day of unprecedentedly intense air combat. The Royal Air Force and anti-aircraft guns shot down no fewer than one hundred and forty-four German planes, the highest number since the start of the war. According to a communiqué from the Air Ministry, the British also lost twenty-seven fighters, but the pilots of eight of them were safe. The Germans intensified their blitzkrieg air war, intending to destroy British airfields, dispatching more than a thousand bombers and fighters. One hundred and thirty were shot down by British fighters, eleven by anti-aircraft guns, two by infantry fire, and one by machine gun fire. The German raid achieved little success, most being intercepted by British fighters, and immediately turned to flee. Only three or four managed to reach Croydon Airport outside London and dropped bombs before escaping. It was found that the airport was attacked for the first time and suffered slight damage. German bombers also crossed the northeast coast of England to drop bombs. Several people were killed or injured in the industrial area, and a train was hit by shrapnel. Britain's new air defense weapon achieved its first success yesterday. This facility was established by the Ministry of Transport at the request of the military authorities. A German bomber touched it and was destroyed, and all the people in the plane died. Houses in the Rochester industrial area were destroyed yesterday, and private houses in several places in Yorkshire were also damaged. It is reported that only one person died. German planes tried to attack Portland, but failed. The public on the southeast coast saw German planes flying close to the coast in batches yesterday, with dozens of fierce air battles. Anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, and when enemy planes flew over the artillery fire, they were immediately intercepted by British fighters. The sound of machine guns roaring incessantly was heard from afar. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin This afternoon, the German military communique stated that yesterday, German planes, day and night, continued to bomb the seaports, arsenals, airfields, and anti-aircraft balloons of the British Isles. The aircraft manufacturing plants and motorcycle manufacturing plants in Birmingham and Broote, as well as the aircraft factories in eastern and southern England, suffered particularly heavy damage. While the German planes were carrying out bombing, British planes responded and fought fiercely several times. In total, at least one hundred and sixteen enemy aircraft were shot down yesterday, including one hundred and six destroyed in air combat, and the rest were either shot down by anti-aircraft guns or destroyed on the ground by German bombs. Twenty-one anti-aircraft balloons were shot down. Thirty-two German planes did not return to their original base. Major Harland's personal record of shooting down enemy aircraft has reached twenty to date. German Red Cross planes rescued nine German pilots and one British pilot in the English Channel. A German submarine sank two armed merchant ships (14,000 tons). A German minesweeper encountered ten British planes coming to bomb, and managed to shoot down four enemy planes, which is also commendable. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>The Air Battle Over Croydon Airport</p>
<p>London Residents within miles of Croydon Airport saw it when the airport was attacked. A woman nearby saw about thirty British and German planes in the air at the same time. According to a Reuters reporter who witnessed the air battle from the upper level of a bus, "As we were driving, we saw thirty or forty planes take off. Suddenly, we heard the sound of machine guns rattling and anti-aircraft guns banging. It seemed that three German planes were shot down, and a team of soldiers cheered whenever a German plane fell." A resident near the airport saw nine planes circling high above the airport, when suddenly another batch of planes broke through the air, and a melee ensued. The anti-aircraft gunners then launched a fierce attack. The German planes only dared to stay over the airport for a minute or two before fleeing in panic. British fighters pursued them. Fire brigades and ambulance teams were dispatched. A hangar near the airport was believed to have been hit by a bomb. The thirty or forty German planes that attacked the airport began their dive three miles from the airport, descending to within a few hundred feet to drop bombs. A bomb narrowly missed the power plant. A few minutes later, anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, and British fighters immediately took off. The German planes turned around to escape, but it was too late, and an air battle ensued. Three German planes were shot down. At the time, the residents showed no signs of panic. The damage to the houses around the airport was still slight, with only one house hit by a bomb. Several hours later, they were still digging for corpses in the rubble. A public car wash outside the wharf was hit by a bomb, and all the windows were shattered and the hood was half destroyed. Passengers were injured by broken glass. Also, twenty-four German planes attacked a certain area in the southeast, and at least four were shot down. The miners in the area watched the battle with their heads held high, and cheered and waved their hats whenever a German plane crashed. Last night, thirty British Spitfire and Hurricane fighters clashed with two hundred German Meuser Schmitt and Dornier planes in a certain area in the southwest, achieving another resounding victory. A town in the area saw twenty German planes shot down by British planes. German crew members who parachuted to the ground were arrested and escorted into the town one after another. In the evening, another eighty German bombers attacked the southeast coast, killing one person. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden German planes bombed the famous British Croydon air station near London for the first time yesterday. This bombing has been confirmed by the British Broadcasting Corporation. When the planes arrived near Croydon, the London air raid sirens were incessant. Residents were panic-stricken and rushed to air raid shelters to take refuge. The extent of the damage is still under investigation. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London Citizens Enter Air Raid Shelters</p>
<p>London Large formations of German planes continued their attacks on the British coast and inland areas last night, apparently seeking to destroy the RAF and defeat its patrol forces in order to invade Britain. Hitler committed more than 1,300 aircraft to this massive air raid, attacking the London area. Croydon Air Station and other suburban outposts were damaged. This large-scale air raid resulted in the Nazi leader losing between 125 and 150 aircraft within 24 hours. The number of German aircraft far exceeded that of British aircraft, at a ratio of four to one. British aircraft numbered just over 300, but the British were able to use them to engage the enemy, losing only 19 aircraft. The ability to prevent the direct bombing of London was entirely due to the efforts of British fighter pilots. After a 20-minute wireless alert during the day, millions of citizens calmly took refuge in air raid shelters, remaining very calm. Groups of German fighters, ranging from 20 to 40, were seen over the Thames, escorting dive bombers flying at high altitude over central London towards Croydon. Later, the Tilbury docks, as well as the defenses of Sheerness, Rochester, and Chatham, were attacked. London's defenses were very agile and effective, and large formations of Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft immediately took to the air to engage. At the same time, the deafening sound of anti-aircraft guns resounded throughout the city, but German bombs eventually hit Croydon Air Station, injuring several people. Later, German planes bombed northeast England, killing at least 12 people. German planes were active again after dusk, concentrating their attacks on the southeast coast of England, strafing countless towns and villages with machine guns. At the same time, British bombers dropped over a ton of bombs on German oil storage facilities and refineries along the French coast. It is reported that four giant bombs destroyed the French Fabry Air Station. At the same time, five other air stations were attacked. (International Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden An air raid alert was issued in London at 6:30 p.m. yesterday, and the British Broadcasting Corporation and other radio stations immediately ceased broadcasting. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Southeast England Attacked Three Times</p>
<p>London According to a communique from the Air Ministry, southeastern England was attacked three times yesterday. In the morning, large formations of German bombers attacked several British air force bases unsuccessfully. British fighters met them head-on and inflicted heavy damage. In the afternoon, another large formation of German bombers appeared, flying quite high, flying over the coast and dropping bombs, and were quickly attacked by British aircraft and driven back to sea. In the evening, German planes again attacked the southeast. Shortly after noon, several German planes flew over the northeast coast and dropped bombs on the Tyneside area and the Sunderland residential area. Casualties were minimal, and military targets were undamaged. Several inland locations were also bombed. One British air force base was bombed, with slight damage to buildings and some casualties. Also, three British coastal fighters, while patrolling the German coast yesterday afternoon, saw twenty-four German bombers limping home after attacking Britain, and a fierce battle ensued. The British planes, outnumbered eight to one, shot down two German planes. Hours before the Germans stepped up their attacks on Britain, large formations of British bombers carried out a night raid on three German oil storage facilities near Bordeaux, France, all of which caught fire and suffered heavy damage. Another squadron of British bombers attacked railway and power stations in Cologne, Germany. Both yesterday and the night before, British planes had been dispatched to attack German airfields in northern France. Four British planes did not return. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London Regarding the incident in which German planes attacked barrage balloons and engaged in combat with British fighters on the south coast, according to a Reuters reporter, the first German plane flew extremely low and shot down a balloon. As it ascended, it was hit by an anti-aircraft shell, caught fire, and crashed into the sea. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>London Last night and today, enemy air activity has spread across a wide area of ​​Britain. Today, seven of the thirty German Junkers dive bombers that attacked a certain area of ​​the southeast coast have been shot down by British fighters. Early this morning, another German bomber was attacked and shot down by British aircraft in the Humber area. Incendiary bombs have fallen in open areas in various eastern counties, but there have been no casualties and the damage is not significant. Several buildings in a certain city in the Midlands have been damaged, including several hospitals and sanatoriums. Last night, when enemy aircraft attacked a certain city on the southwest coast, a school was hit by a bomb, killing several students and injuring a small number who have been sent to the hospital. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>German Statement on the Air Battles</p>
<p>Berlin German aircraft yesterday again bombed British air force bases and seaports. German aircraft arrived one after another, almost preventing British fighters from getting a moment's rest. British interception was ineffective, and British anti-aircraft gunners fired inaccurately, so no German aircraft abandoned its bombing mission. Although British military experts claim that Britain's anti-aircraft gun network can prevent German aircraft attacks, the results of today's experiments prove that its effectiveness is minimal. Protecting Britain and resisting German air raids cannot be entrusted to the British anti-aircraft gunners, but must be entirely entrusted to the British fighter pilots. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin Yesterday's air battle in England proved that Britain's so-called domestic air defense line has lost its effectiveness. Due to the failure of the British anti-aircraft gunners, Britain had to send fighters into battle. Also, because German aircraft attacked British fighter forces in various places, the British air defense forces were dispersed in various places. British air defense is not sufficient to resist German aircraft. German aircraft are often able to break into the key areas of British air defense, select their targets, and bomb them, destroying British military targets. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin According to an official report issued here yesterday, another air battle occurred over Dover yesterday. When German planes bombed the Hawkins airfield west of Dover, they engaged in an air battle with British Spitfires. As a result, the British lost eight Spitfires and four Hurricane aircraft.

<p>Berlin When the German Air Force attacked southeastern England yesterday, many airfields in the Melrose, Newnham, and Eastchurch areas were bombed. Hangars, houses, and aircraft were all destroyed. During the air battles, several British fighters were shot down. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin Regarding the German bomber attack on Kent, the first report was received here at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. It was reported that the hangars at Lympne Airfield had been completely destroyed. After the anti-aircraft guns were hit by German bombs, they stopped firing. All German planes safely returned to their base. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin Britain's attempt to prevent German planes from bombing Hawkins Airfield has now completely failed. German planes invaded the airfield yesterday and dropped many bombs. The hangars caught fire on the spot. Although British fighters were waiting in battle, the German planes followed orders and descended rapidly from the clouds to the lower level, circling over the targets they wanted to bomb. Yesterday, two German Junkers Ju 87 Stuka dive bombers did not return to their original base. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Berlin According to news last night, a squadron of German bombers bombed the airfield at Thrybergh in Yorkshire. Hangars and barracks were destroyed. Twelve enemy Spitfires were heavily damaged. There were no German losses. Thrybergh is near the estuary of the River Aire and has several airfields. The area was completely undefended and anti-aircraft guns were powerless. By the time the British planes appeared, the German mission had already been completed. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>London According to those responsible, the severity of the situation in British Somaliland has not diminished. Italian forces are advancing rapidly along the coastal road from Zeila to Berbera, and have now reached 20 miles west of Bulhar. It is estimated that one route of the Italian forces, starting from Hargeisa, numbers between 9,000 and 10,000 men. The British forces are far outnumbered, but British casualties are not as heavy as those of the Italian forces. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Nairobi A communique issued here last night stated that Wajir in Kenya was bombed yesterday by three Italian planes, which dropped several heavy bombs, but there was no material damage.

There was no activity by British land forces. British planes carried out reconnaissance deep into southern Abyssinia. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Gibraltar A Reuters correspondent reports that the reporter, traveling on the British warship "___," patrolled the Strait of Gibraltar for two days and nights, and has just returned here. It is certain that ships under British naval protection can freely enter and leave the Mediterranean, because Italian merchant ships and Italian warships have been cleared from the sea. Before Italy declared war, the British contraband control station intercepted at least twelve Italian merchant ships every day. Now, Italian merchant ships have disappeared, and traffic to and from Italian ports has ceased. The reporter, traveling for two days and nights, only saw six merchant ships, all Spanish ships sailing between Spain and Spanish Morocco. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>New York A New York Times dispatch from Rome, referring to the British air raid on the Caproni factory in Milan and the Fiat factory in Turin, said that almost nowhere in Italy is not talking about this air raid. The fact that British planes were able to fly from Britain to Italy without being disturbed along the way has made a deep impression on the Italian people. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome According to the Italian General Headquarters, the Italian army continued its offensive in British Somaliland. A British plane was shot down over Zeila and burned on the spot. British planes bombed the airfields of Combolcia and Massawa, causing very little damage, but killing four and injuring twelve. Italian planes attacked Wegele, destroying two planes in the airfield, and shooting down a British fighter in an air battle. Several Italian bombers, protected by fighters, attacked the Alfa airfield on Malta, which immediately caught fire after being hit by bombs, and shot down a British plane. All Italian planes safely returned to their base. Italian planes also bombed the railway at Matruh in North Africa. British planes flew over Switzerland this morning and bombed northern Italy, killing two and injuring five in the village of Olgette, but the damage was minimal. An anti-aircraft battery near Turin shot down a British plane. (Haitong dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Commentary on the European War Situation: The Fate of the British Empire is at Stake</h3>
<p>Moscow The newspaper "Izvestia" today published an article titled "Britain Fights to Preserve its Colonies," commenting that "The defeat of France has greatly affected Britain's position and its African and Near Eastern territories. Britain's previous military plans have completely failed, and it can now only rely on its own naval and land forces to fight. Italy's invasion of Somaliland is the prelude to the battle for the Suez Canal (i.e., Egypt). Due to the spatial scale of the war and the instability of the political relationship between colonies and dependencies, the battle for the Mediterranean and colonies has become more complicated. For example, Egypt is unwilling to fight for the interests of others. However, we should pay attention to a very important fact, namely that all the battles for the Mediterranean and colonies will depend on the situation in Europe. Therefore, we believe that the fate of British territories and maritime traffic will depend entirely on the outcome of the European war." (TASS dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>German Planes Using Parachutes in England: Only Intended to Confuse People</h3>
<p>London Authorities stated that the enemy's dropping of parachutes on the night of the 13th to the 14th was nothing more than a clumsy trick by the enemy to disrupt British morale. The German's purpose in doing this was clearly to promote propaganda that Britain was bound to lose and to spread panic, but it ultimately failed. According to the Intelligence Department, the enemy's dropping of parachutes is being further investigated. The parachutes mostly landed far apart from each other, some landed without opening, some fell on rooftops and trees. In several places, local militias saw the parachutes fall and rushed to pick them up. In addition to empty parachutes, they also found small bags containing operational instructions. It is clear that the enemy intended for this bag to fall into the hands of the British military authorities. The documents contained in the bag have now been found to be false instructions.

<h3>Swiss Government Protests to England Regarding British Planes Entering its Territory</h3>

<h3>British Newspapers Praise the Great Achievements of the Air Force</h3>
<p>London The great achievements of the British Air Force continue to be praised by newspapers here. The Daily Mail reported that if Hitler had come to Britain yesterday as promised, it was not in person, but by his representatives. The representatives of Hitler, both dead and dying, fell from the sky and fell on our seas and shores. By the end of the day, their losses had been extremely heavy. There is hardly a district in Britain that has not reported the arrival of German planes, and there is not a district that has not reported their failure. We must admit that the intensity of the air raids has expanded to an unprecedented extent, and it is possible that it will expand further in the future. However, the experience we have gained so far has made us no longer afraid of air attacks, because the great Royal Air Force has not failed to overcome them. The News Chronicle stated that the aerial blitzkrieg tactics have brought us closer to Germany in terms of quantity, and equality in quantity means that the doctor has complete dominance. With the help of the United States, we will certainly achieve this goal. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>Berlin The German News Agency announced that the negotiations between Hungary and Romania opened this morning in Turnu Severin, but were announced to be adjourned for two days after only half an hour of discussion, because the Romanian representatives wanted to present the Hungarian proposal to their government. The Romanian representatives set off for Bucharest this afternoon and will return to Turnu Severin on Sunday to resume discussions. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Women Raise Funds to Purchase a Plane</h3>

<h3>British Admiralty Announces Accurate Loss Figures, Denounces German Communique as Inaccurate</h3>
<p>London - The Admiralty has recently released figures proving the inaccuracy of German claims of sinking numerous British warships and a large number of merchant ships. According to the British side, the confirmed number of naval vessel losses, including submarines, totals forty-seven ships. The enemy communique claimed to have sunk or severely damaged two hundred and sixty-nine British ships. The number of British battleships, aircraft carriers, and cruisers that the Germans claimed to have sunk or severely damaged exceeds the total number possessed by Britain. For example, the Germans claimed to have sunk or severely damaged thirty-two British battleships and battlecruisers, but Britain only had fifteen of these two types of warships at the start of the war. The confirmed tonnage of merchant ships lost by Britain, Allied nations, and neutral countries due to enemy action totals 2,500,000 tons, but the number publicized by the enemy exceeds 5,000,000 tons.

<h3>Shaw Speaks Out, Warns the World: Once Aroused, the English are Unmatched in Bravery</h3>
<p>London - The famous playwright George Bernard Shaw met with reporters yesterday and warned the world with satirical remarks, saying that Britain is just beginning to fight.

<h3>US Senator Proposes Selling 50 US Warships to Britain in Exchange for British West Indian Islands; Both British and American Authorities Deny the Matter</h3>
<p>Washington - Democratic Senator Lee Ju-hsu today formally submitted to the Senate a proposal that has been advocated for some time, namely, to sell fifty old destroyers to Britain. Lee had visited the White House for discussions a few hours before submitting the proposal. When presenting his reasons in the Senate, Lee spoke eloquently and continuously, stating that Hitler was the most brutal butcher ever seen on the face of the Earth, and that the only thing standing between the United States and this evil god was the British fleet. He stressed that the sale of destroyers to Britain was a matter of victory or defeat. When Lee finished his speech, the entire chamber erupted in applause that lasted for a long time. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - White House Secretary O'Leary recently told the press that President Roosevelt had denied reports that the United States was preparing to supply destroyers to Britain in exchange for Britain ceding islands in the Western Hemisphere to the United States. O'Leary said that when he discussed this report with the President, the President replied, "What is said in this report is absolutely not the case." The State Department declined to comment on this report. However, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau told the press here yesterday that the British Purchasing Commission had urged the United States to pay attention to Britain's need for destroyers two months ago, but he had not heard of any request for Britain to exchange islands in the Western Hemisphere for US destroyers. Furthermore, according to sources here, the number of destroyers Britain currently needs is the same as the number possessed by the United States. During the previous European war, General Pershing, Commander-in-Chief of the American Expeditionary Force, Senator Lodge, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and others, suggested selling US destroyers to Britain. This resale would require the permission of Congress, but no one in Congress has proposed any special legislation regarding such a resale. However, Senator Bulkeley recently suggested exchanging fifty destroyers for British-owned islands in the Western Hemisphere. According to rumors in diplomatic circles, Britain has already informed the United States about this exchange, but the Secretary of State has repeatedly requested information and has not been informed about it. The British Embassy stated that this rumor could only be answered by the British Foreign Office in London. However, this news has aroused great attention among international figures here. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain Willing to Lease Islands to the US as Air Force Bases</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters diplomatic correspondent states that responsible sources here say that reports that Britain is currently planning to sell some islands in the Caribbean are unfounded. On the other hand, if the US government proposes leasing them as air force bases, the British government will sympathetically accept the proposal. However, it would be a mistake to link this proposal with the issue of purchasing American destroyers. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Regarding the Cession of British Islands, One Account Says Negotiations are Underway</h3>
<p>New York - The New York Times yesterday published a dispatch from Washington stating that negotiations on Britain granting rights over the West Indies to the United States in exchange for American destroyers and torpedo boats are mostly complete, and a final decision could be reached within days. It is said that Britain is willing to cede certain islands to the United States and allow the United States the right to build naval, land, and air bases in any British territory in the Western Hemisphere. When asked about this matter at the British Embassy, the British Embassy replied that there was no statement to be issued and instructed the questioner to inquire with the US State Department. However, the State Department said that it had not heard of such talks. Although British and American authorities have not made any affirmative statements, well-informed sources believe that although formal negotiations have not taken place, there may have been some contact in an informal and non-official manner. The claim that negotiations are nearly complete may be an exaggeration, as American destroyers cannot be transferred to other countries without special permission from Congress. However, this exchange arrangement should be approved by Congress and the Navy. This is undoubtedly the case. Since the outbreak of the European war, Congress and newspapers have advocated finding a way to obtain one of the British West Indian islands as a naval and air base to protect the Panama Canal. At the same time, naval experts have repeatedly stated publicly that if the United States obtains Trinidad as a naval and air base, the Panama Canal could be protected from attacks from the Atlantic. According to those close to the Navy, the destroyers from the last World War that are still in service are not truly obsolete and are still extremely useful in the US Navy. Therefore, the relevant parties are unwilling to prove that they are obsolete and useless, as they do with naval aircraft. People here believe that if a temporary agreement is reached, it will take a month for Congress to pass legislation, and another month to train British crew members, as American destroyers are superior to British destroyers. According to United Press International, there is a rumor in Congress that Britain will lease naval bases in the Western Hemisphere to the United States for a term of ninety-nine years as compensation for allowing them to purchase American destroyers. There are also reports that Attorney General Jackson has expressed his opinion to the White House that current laws do not prevent the sale of destroyers, as long as the Chief of Naval Operations certifies that they are not necessary for the defense of the United States.

<h3>US House Passes National Guard Bill, Returns to Senate for Reconsideration</h3>
<p>Washington - Yesterday, the US House of Representatives passed a bill to mobilize 408,000 National Guard and Reserve troops to serve in various locations in the Western Hemisphere. This action is a major victory for Roosevelt. (International News Service, 16th)</p>
<p>Washington - The House of Representatives yesterday unanimously passed a bill authorizing President Roosevelt to mobilize 460,000 National Guard and Army Reserve troops for one year of service throughout the Western Hemisphere. This bill, which aims to increase the size of the US standing army to 400,000 men, has been sent back to the Senate for reconsideration due to slight amendments made by the House. The Senate passed this bill last week by a vote of 71 to 7. The Senate is currently engaged in debating the conscription bill. Yesterday, during the House debate on the National Guard bill, there was fierce debate over the so-called restriction on the use of the National Guard within the United States and its territories. However, the proposal to adopt this amendment was rejected by a vote of 210 to 110. Mr. May, Chairman of the House Army Committee, responded to the opposition's claim that the National Guard should only be convened when Congress declares war or a state of emergency, stating that Congress is effectively declaring this state of emergency by passing this bill now, and it is generally believed that sending the National Guard to various locations in the Western Hemisphere is to consolidate the Monroe Doctrine and strengthen the Havana Declaration. This declaration clearly stipulates that the twenty-one republics of the Americas mutually guarantee cooperation to protect the Western Hemisphere. Also, before the vote on the bill, military experts and New York Republican Representative Wadsworth harshly condemned those who advocated restricting the activities of the National Guard and Reserve troops to the United States and its territories. Wadsworth also stated that the mobilization of the National Guard is not only for training but also to deal with any emergency situation in the Western Hemisphere. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>US War Department Concludes Contract to Mass Produce Tanks</h3>
<p>Washington - The US War Department yesterday concluded a contract with Chrysler Corporation for US$53.5 million to produce a large number of tanks for the US Army. This contract is the largest contract in the United States for building new munitions industries with federal funding. The contract stipulates that US$20 million of this amount will be used to build factories and purchase equipment, and the remaining US$33.5 million will be used to manufacture tanks. The factory will be located in the Detroit area, the center of the US automobile manufacturing industry. It is expected that the factory will employ 4,000 to 5,000 workers at the start, and it is heard that work can begin within thirteen months. War Department officials said yesterday that the factory's production area will be 800,000 square feet, and the entire factory will occupy 113 acres. A War Department spokesman did not specify, but authoritative sources said that this contract will produce 1,000 medium tanks, each weighing 25 tons. This contract was negotiated by Knutson, Director of Production for the National Defense Advisory Commission, and Mr. Keller, owner of Chrysler Corporation, for a period of two months.

<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Prepares to Revamp the Domestic Front; Conducting Consultations with Leaders from Various Sectors; Obata Appointed Vice President of the Planning Board</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Prime Minister Konoe will begin implementing a new political structure and revamping the domestic front at the end of this month. At that time, after obtaining formal approval from the Cabinet, he will issue a declaration to the nation. Konoe has been in close contact with leaders from the political, financial, economic, and journalistic sectors to gauge their opinions on organizing a new and strong domestic front. The Chief Cabinet Secretary is currently actively drafting a declaration to be issued to the nation, which will be submitted to the Cabinet for formal approval at the end of this month. After issuing the declaration to the nation, Konoe will separately invite thirty representatives from the government, the army, the navy, political parties, finance, and education sectors to propose the establishment of a preparatory committee for the domestic front. It is expected that Konoe will serve as chairman. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," Obata, the accounting manager of the Osaka Sumitomo Corporation, has recently been appointed as Vice President of the Cabinet Planning Board. Obata is a classmate of Hoshino, the current President of the Planning Board. He has traveled to China and Manchuria and strongly supports the proposal that the South Sea Islands should be included in Japan's economic sphere of influence. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan and the Dutch East Indies Sign Agreement; Economic Relations Strengthen</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The "Asahi Shimbun" recently reported that the Japanese government has signed an agreement with the authorities of the Dutch East Indies stipulating that the Dutch East Indies will increase the quantity of raw materials such as kerosene, rubber, and sugar transported to Japan. In addition, representatives from both sides are conducting talks on the issue of Japanese people going to the Dutch East Indies to engage in industry and commerce. In short, the economic relations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies have greatly developed. Since the outbreak of the European war, the foreign sales channels for Dutch East Indies goods and the sources of imported goods have been blocked. Therefore, in recent months, the export of Japanese cotton, rayon, chemicals, and other goods to the Dutch East Indies has greatly increased. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Romanian Ceded Areas Sovietized; Banks and Industries Nationalized; Farmland Distributed to Farmers</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has recently issued an order declaring that all banks, industries, railways, water transport, and transportation in Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina are nationalized. The Soviet land nationalization laws will also be restored in the two regions.</p>
<p>A telegram also stated that the authorities in Northern Bukovina recently granted land to landless farmers. This work is currently underway. It has been verified that in the month and a half since Soviet rule, 30,000 hectares of land have been distributed to landless farmers in the Chernivtsi area. In addition, cultural work and medical facilities are also being carried out on a large scale. (TASS, 16th)</p>

<h3>Norwegian Female Writer Undset Leaves Japan</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Norwegian female writer Sigrid Undset, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1929, recently traveled to Japan with her youngest son (her eldest son died in the Norwegian war). She spent two weeks in Kyoto, Nara, Osaka, and Tokyo and left Japan yesterday on the "President Cleveland" steamer from Kobe. Mrs. Undset told a reporter from the "Japan Chronicle" that the world situation is chaotic and she intends to stop writing from now on. What she prays for is peace. However, in today's world, what can a writer with a clear mind write? Although she has no notable impressions of the various cities in Japan, she generally found it pleasant. The rural scenery of Japan is quite pleasing to the eye.</p>
<h3>Greek Warship Sunk; Italian-Greek Relations Worsen; Greece Makes Military Preparations to Deal with Contingencies; Turkey Extremely Uneasy About Italian Actions</h3>
<p>London - Reuters learned from responsible sources here last night that there are no British submarines near the Greek island of Tinos in the Aegean Sea. However, it is known that Italian submarines are active in the area. The Greek light cruiser "Helle" (2,115 tons) was sunk near Tinos Island yesterday morning by a submarine of unknown nationality. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Athens - Foreign diplomatic sources here believe that the Italian-Greek friction caused by the assassination of Albanian patriot Hoxha has further intensified yesterday due to the sinking of the Greek destroyer "Helle" near the Tinos Islands yesterday morning. Diplomatic sources believe that relations between the two countries are rapidly deteriorating due to the unanimous attacks on Greece by the Italian press. The "Helle" was hit by two moving torpedoes, resulting in the death and injury of many children. It is widely believed that this action will further threaten peace in the Balkans. After the sinking of the "Helle," motorized infantrymen drove throughout the city last night, recalling naval officers on holiday to return to their ships immediately. The Italian sectors here continue to believe that with time and propaganda, the Axis powers should be able to make territorial and economic changes to Greece without resorting to force. The so-called territorial changes include ceding Northern Epirus to Albania and Corfu to Italy. At the same time, the Greek government has not issued any comments on the sinking of the "Helle." The Tinos Islands are located about one hundred miles east of the Italian submarine base "Leros." The "Helle" was hit by one of three torpedoes, resulting in one death and thirty injuries. The other two torpedoes hit the wharf, where many sick pilgrims were gathered who had come to the island to offer prayers to the Virgin Mary of Tinos on August 15th. They were also unfortunately affected, resulting in one death and several injuries. The destroyer, weighing 2,115 tons, was originally named "Feiyun" and was built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation for the Chinese government. It was later sold to Greece in 1914. (United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>Athens - Greece has been actively preparing for war since announcing its determination not to accept Italian demands in order to prevent the Italian army from invading through Albania. Therefore, the situation between Greece and Italy has become more tense. Furthermore, news has recently been received from Istanbul that Turkey is greatly disturbed by Italy's accusations against Greece in connection with the death of Albanian Nationalist Hoxha. The People's Party newspaper "Tanin" stated that it is doubtful whether there is a real rebellion occurring within Albania, or whether Italy's actions are actually "a means of inciting incidents."

<h3>Guangxi University Efforts to Expand (Part 1): Increasing Departments and Adding Farms; Regular Annual Expenditures Provided by the National Treasury</h3>
<p>(Lin Correspondent) Guangxi University currently has three colleges: the College of Liberal Arts and Law, the College of Science and Engineering, and the College of Agriculture. The main campus for the College of Liberal Arts and Law and the College of Science and Engineering is located in Liangfeng Park. The College of Agriculture is located in Shatang, Liuzhou. The College of Liberal Arts and Law currently has three departments: Law, Political Science, and Economics, as well as one class each of a Banking and Accounting Specialization Program and a Liberal Arts, History, and Geography Specialization Course. As for the Literary and Social Studies department, which was merged from the Teacher's College, it was ordered to be changed to a Specialization Course in September of the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e. 1937]. It ended early that year, and after all students participated in the Guangxi Student Army and departed for front-line work, enrollment has now been suspended. The College of Science and Engineering currently has six departments: Mathematics and Physics, Chemistry, Civil Engineering, Mining and Metallurgy, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. The College of Agriculture currently has three departments: Agronomy, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine. It is also affiliated with a Plant Research Institute and an Agricultural and Forestry Training Class. The main campus is affiliated with a University Preparatory Class and an Experimental Primary School.</p>
<p>The recruitment of students for the various colleges, departments, and classes is, in principle, conducted during the summer vacation. However, to accommodate special circumstances, recruitment may be conducted in the spring. This is generally the same as other national universities. However, one special feature of this school is that, according to Ministry of Education regulations, all first-year university students must be taught basic subjects of the same kind, regardless of their college or department. All students are concentrated on the main campus for one year of training. The advantages of this new arrangement are: (1) it can utilize excellent teaching staff; (2) it can save expenses; and (3) it can cultivate the habit of group living.</p>
<p>In order to meet practical needs, the school will expand its various colleges and departments starting next year. It is currently planned to change the Liberal Arts, History, and Geography Specialization Course of the College of Liberal Arts and Law to the Department of Liberal Arts, History, and Geography, and to change the Banking and Accounting Specialization Program to the Department of Banking and Accounting. The College of Science and Engineering will add a Department of Earth Sciences and a Department of Chemical Engineering. The College of Agriculture will add a Department of Horticulture and a Department of Agricultural Economics. The Xiang-Gui Railway Administration has recently sent a letter to the school requesting the addition of a Department of Railway Engineering. It is heard that the various departments have already drafted detailed plans and submitted them to the Ministry of Education for approval. Once the procedures are completed, they can be formally established.</p>
<p>In the past, the College of Science and Engineering and the College of Agriculture had magnificent buildings and vast experimental fields in Wuzhou, which naturally received much praise. However, now that the College of Liberal Arts and Law and the College of Science and Engineering are in Liangfeng, and the College of Agriculture is in Liuzhou, all the facilities, compared to the famous universities that have moved repeatedly, naturally have their shortcomings. This cannot be denied. As far as the main campus, the College of Liberal Arts and Law, and the College of Science and Engineering are concerned, the two colleges and all first-year students have complete dormitories, spacious classrooms, laboratories, research rooms, a large library, palace-style office buildings, and newly built faculty dormitories, listening rooms, etc. in Liangfeng Park. Although some books, machines, specimens, and models have been lost due to the move, most of them are still completely intact. Currently, two formerly famous universities have written to the school to borrow physics instruments, but due to inconvenient transportation and difficulty in moving them, the request was declined. Since the College of Agriculture moved to Shatang in Liuzhou, new school buildings have been built, and vast farms and forests have been opened up. There are laboratories and pharmaceutical plants, and greenhouses and cold frames are all equipped. Since becoming a national university, the school's various buildings have been appearing in the embrace of the Yan Mountains with a brand-new look, despite the constant air raid alerts. The expansion of the new school buildings began when President Ma took office last year. After day and night work, the completed buildings include the Mining and Metallurgy Room, the Chemical Engineering Room, the Mechanical Room, the Materials and Electrical Room, the new-style hospital, and the large library storage and reading room. The buildings that remain to be completed include the Distilled Water Room, the Physics Building, the Chemistry Building, the Power Room, and the new student dormitories. These buildings will be completed during the summer vacation this year. Two months ago, the school began using electric lights, and running water will be available during the summer vacation.

<h3>Adult Education Promotion Association: Adult Literacy Schools, Fifth Term Begins</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Adult Compulsory Education Promotion Association, with the aim of eradicating illiteracy and promoting adult compulsory education, has been established for some time and has already run four terms of schools. It operates and co-operates a total of fifty-seven classes, with over three thousand students. Previously, it has been entrusted by the Shanghai Municipal Council Chinese Staff Association, the Booksellers' Association, the Ching Wu Athletic Association, the Hwa Lien Amusement Club, the Wood Industry Education Promotion Association, the Sino-French Pharmacy, the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, the Greater Shanghai Leather Factory, the Yi Tai Hing Coal Company, and Mr. Xu Guojun, among others, to run schools. It is now reported that the fifth term of classes will begin within days. In addition to continuing the previous methods, many improvements will be made in the teaching aspects, so that all types of people will be happy to attend school. In terms of age, it is set at sixteen to fifty years old, especially encouraging older dropouts to enroll voluntarily. At present, the quotas for workers in various factories, tram company workers, old wood industry foremen, and cotton cloth apprentices in each school are already full. Its central schools are divided into five districts: District 1, 1085 Gordon Road, Robison Road; District 2, New Tang Lane, New Tang Li, Datong Road; District 3, Ci Hou Nan Li, Avenue Haig, Rue Amann; District 4, The Great Bell, Robison Road; District 5, Xi He Le Li, Park Road, Avenue Edward VII.</p>

<h3>Who Is the Shanghai Basketball Champion? Suggestion for a Charity Challenge Match: Can the Paramount Maintain Its Hegemony? Readers Propose Forming a Mixed Team to Challenge</h3>
<p>The Paramount's victory in the United Cup Charity Basketball Tournament has been confirmed. Their performance and strength are indeed above those of other participating teams. We have received a letter from reader Mr. Zhang, advocating that the top players scattered among other teams be mixed into two or three strong teams to play several charity challenge matches against the Paramount to determine the best. This is indeed a competition worth promoting. At that time, it will surely cause a sensation in Shanghai, killing two birds with one stone. Whether the Paramount holds the hegemony of Chinese basketball in Shanghai can also be resolved. It is thought that the athletes will definitely be happy to show their skills. The letter is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Dear Editor, The United Cup Charity Basketball Tournament held by the Refugee Children's Education and Care Institute this time has gathered almost all of the strong teams in Shanghai. In particular, the two champions, Paramount and Shanghai Chinese YMCA, met again to determine the winner, which is most concerned by the basketball community. In addition to the original lineup, the Shanghai Chinese YMCA has also added former China United players. The Paramount has also strengthened its strength. Therefore, the gains and losses of the championship are really related to the control of Chinese basketball hegemony in Shanghai. However, the results of the competition were unexpected. The Paramount swept all opponents, while the Shanghai Chinese YMCA suffered three defeats in a row. The defeat of Shanghai Chinese YMCA was not due to a lack of strength. When they played, the main players were injured or absent. It can be said that defeat is destined, not the fault of the battle. Other teams also have many strong players. The pity is that they are scattered among the teams and cannot be concentrated to fight against the Paramount. Therefore, the issue of the Paramount's championship is indeed interesting. Without being presumptuous, for the sake of basketball interest and for the sake of charity, I suggest that the other teams in Groups A and B of the United Cup, if they can supplement strong players as much as possible, increase their strength, or concentrate the strong players and organize two or three strong mixed teams, play a three-game, two-win final against the Paramount in a neutral and legal venue (such as the Chinese YMCA), it will surely cause a sensation in the Shanghai basketball community, and the refugee children will also benefit greatly. Such a meaningful and great competition, if promoted by the media and promoted to success, is really what the sports community, the Refugee Children's Education and Care Institute, and enthusiastic people are looking forward to.

<h3>Shanghai Open Swimming Competition: First Event Tonight at the French Club</h3>
<p>The first event of the Shanghai Amateur Swimming Association's Shanghai Open Swimming Competition is scheduled to open tonight at 9:00 PM at the French Club. There are a total of five events, including four for men and one for women. At this session, the conference decided that the flip turn would be allowed as a legal move in backstroke. Also, due to the large number of participants in the women's 50-yard freestyle, a preliminary round was held a few days ago. As a result, six ladies including Lin Meiling, Mantemoya, Grant, Peach, Liqia, and Glack were selected. The order of events for tonight is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Men's 220-Yard Freestyle (2) Men's 200-Yard Backstroke (3) Women's 50-Yard Freestyle (4) Men's Novice 100-Yard Freestyle (5) Men's 880-Yard Freestyle</p>
<h3>United Cup Basketball Games Today: Qunyi Faces Youlian Again, A2 Zhongyi vs. Xihua for Last Place</h3>
<p>The United Cup Charity Basketball Tournament will have one game each from Group A and Group Shenyi this afternoon. In Group A2, Xihua will face Zhongyi. The former has five losses and one win, while the latter has lost every game. Therefore, today's battle is a struggle for the "yellow parcel" (a colloquialism for last place). In Group A1, Qunyi will face Youlian. Youlian won in the first round. Today, Youlian should be able to win again. However, Qunyi has recently defeated strong teams, so it is difficult to predict who will win. The order of events is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhongyi—Xihua (A2) 5:30 PM Zheng Zhifang</p>

<h3>Garrison Defense Plan Announced Yesterday: Central District Handed to American Forces, Municipal Council Resolution to Accept, Takeover Reportedly to Begin Next Saturday</h3>
<p>The results of the foreign military commanders' meeting held at the Shanghai Municipal Council the day before yesterday are of great importance to the interests of Chinese and foreign citizens. The long-awaited good news was finally officially announced at nine o'clock yesterday morning. Regarding the replacement of the British defense forces after their withdrawal, it was decided that the central area of the Public Settlement and the western area of Hongkou, previously defended by the British West Fokershire Highlanders, would be taken over by the Fourth Marine Regiment of the U.S. Navy, while the western area of the Public Settlement, originally defended by the East Surrey Regiment, would be defended by the Japanese Marines. It is reported that the two armies will begin the takeover simultaneously on the 24th of this month. The news was welcomed by all parties, but the Japanese side seemed to have deep regrets about this. They claimed that the resolution passed by the Defense Forces Commanders' Committee would be re-discussed before the British army handed over. It is believed that if the Defense Forces Commanders' Committee is convened again, the date will be before the British army leaves Shanghai. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Defense Area Distribution Announced Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office issued the following letter from the Shanghai Foreign Defense Forces Committee to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council on August 16: "Sunday, August 15, the commanders of the foreign defense forces held a meeting and passed the following recommendations by a majority vote: 'The part of District D currently defended by the British army should be handed over to the Japanese army for defense, and the part of District B currently defended by the British army should be handed over to the American army for defense.' The Japanese member voted against the above recommendation and reserved the right to submit another plan to the Defense Forces Committee. The Italian member did not vote. The above-mentioned motions must be approved by the Municipal Council and the governments of the countries concerned.</p>
<p>The Committee unanimously agreed that none of the above should be published before 9:00 AM on August 16. Please keep the above resolutions secret before that time.</p>
<p>(Note) The boundary of the part of District D currently defended by the British army is approximately as follows: from the Suzhou River to the railway line at the intersection of Hongqiao Road, turning to Lujiazai Road, Haig Road, Jessfield Road, and Kinnear Road. From the intersection of Kinnear Road and Edinburgh Road, a straight line extends northwest to the Suzhou River (Jessfield Road intersection) and then west along the Suzhou River to the railway line. The boundary of District B extends south from Avenue Edward VII to Boundary Road, west to Yu Qiaqing Road and North Tibet Road, and east from the Bund via the Suzhou River, turning to North Henan Road to the Boundary Road intersection."</p>
<p>This Move Boosts Chinese Morale</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, August 16: According to unofficial sources, the foreign military commanders stationed in Shanghai held a meeting and decided that after the withdrawal of the British army stationed in the Public Settlement, most of the area would be taken over by the U.S. Marine Corps. The New York News editorial criticized this matter this morning, saying that Japanese militarists have long held the view that if the Japanese army only needs to enter the Public Settlement to threaten Westerners or Chinese, they can make the entire Chinese people feel that the Japanese have been recognized as the masters of the Far East, and it will be easier to break the Chinese people's will to resist. Therefore, hearing this news will undoubtedly cause resentment. For this reason, this move is actually a diplomatic defeat for Japan against the United States, which can reduce the decline of British prestige and greatly increase the excitement of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Council Convened Special Board Meeting and Passed It</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council convened a special board meeting yesterday morning at 9:00 AM to discuss the handover plan decided at the Defense Forces Conference. The meeting adjourned at 11:15 AM. Those who attended this special board meeting yesterday morning included Chairman Keesee, U.S. Chairman Crane, Chinese Directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, British Directors Holland, MacDonald, Powell, Mikiell, U.S. Director Alerman, Japanese Directors Isoo and Okamoto, and those absent were Chinese Director Jiang Yiping. Those present included Council Secretary and Chief Executive Fessenden, Deputy Secretary Cabot, Chinese Deputy Secretary He Dehui, and Information Office Director Nash. First, Council Secretary Fessenden reported the handover plan decided at the Defense Forces Conference and submitted it for discussion. At that time, the Chairman and the four British Directors, and the Deputy Chairman and U.S. Director Alerman, all expressed their approval. Japanese Directors Isoo and Okamoto opposed it. The four Chinese Directors also expressed their support for the U.S. defense forces taking over the central and northern districts. Finally, a vote was taken. As a result, the five British Directors and the two U.S. Directors voted in favor. The four Chinese Directors abstained from voting because the western district was handed over to the Japanese army for defense. The two Japanese Directors voted against it, but it passed completely with a vote of seven to two.</p>
<p>Published Statement Supplementing Opinions</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Information Office issued an official statement yesterday stating that the Council had received a letter from the Joint Defense Forces Committee dated this month 15th. At the special meeting held by the Council on the 16th at 10:00 AM, the letter was submitted for consideration. The majority of the Joint Defense Forces Committee recommended that Defense District "B," which is currently defended by British forces, should be handed over to the American forces for defense, and a portion of Defense District "D," which is currently defended by British forces, should be handed over to the Japanese forces for defense. It was decided to notify the Committee that the recommendation was approved. However, knowing that the Japanese member of the Joint Defense Forces Committee had reserved the right to submit other plans, the Council also decided to notify the Committee that if another recommendation is submitted in the future, and the Committee promptly notifies the Council, so that arrangements can be made before the British forces withdraw from Defense Districts "B" and "D," the Council also reserves the right to consider the recommendation in detail.</p>
<p>Separate Reports Submitted to Governments for Approval</p>
<p>According to diplomatic circles, the recommendations passed at the Defense Forces Conference the day before yesterday have been separately reported to their respective governments for approval by the British, American, Italian, and Japanese members. It is reported that the British and American sides separately telegraphed their respective governments in Washington and London one hour after the meeting adjourned the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Takeover Reportedly to Begin Next Saturday</p>
<p>According to reliable foreign sources, the American Marines are scheduled to take over the central district of the Public Settlement (i.e., the area south of Suzhou Creek, north of Avenue Edward VII, west from Yu Qiaqing Road, and east to the Bund) and the northern district (i.e., the area north of Suzhou Creek to Boundary Road, east from North Henan Road to North Tibet Road) on the 24th of this month, i.e., next Saturday, before the British army withdraws. As for the area east from Yu Qiaqing Road to Jing'an Temple and the Haig Road area on Jiaozhou Road, it is still an American defense area. As for the area west of Jing'an Temple in the western district of the British army defense area, the Japanese army will also take over on the same day as the American army.</p>
<p>Italian Military Commander Abstained from Voting</p>
<p>At the Defense Forces Conference held the day before yesterday, the Japanese side insisted on its own views during the time from 12:00 PM to 1:30 PM, and it almost became a stalemate. But in the end, a vote was taken. The British and American defense force commanders voted in favor, while the Japanese commander Takeda voted against it, and Lande abstained from voting. Thus, the above-mentioned takeover plan recommendation was passed by a majority of two to one, and Chairman Keesee of the Municipal Council was notified at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side May Submit Another Plan</p>
<p>After the vote at the meeting, Japanese Commander Takeda declared that he reserved the right to submit another plan to the Defense Forces Committee. According to those concerned, the Japanese side may submit a so-called plan within days. Therefore, this meeting may be held again within days, but the date should be before the British defense forces leave Shanghai. However, it is believed that although the Japanese side has declared that it reserves the right to submit another plan, it is not enough to shake or change the motion passed at the meeting the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Tokyo Expresses Considerable Resentment</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, August 16: Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma told newspaper reporters today that if the United States intends to take over the British army defense area in Shanghai, it is feared that the plan may not be realized. When asked about the news that Colonel Baker, commander of the U.S. Fourth Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai, intends to take over the British army defense area in the Public Settlement after the British defense forces withdraw, Suma replied, "I do not know whether the U.S. military commander proposed this motion at the Shanghai Defense Joint Committee meeting yesterday. However, my impression is that this view has very little possibility of being realized, because Shanghai is not part of the territory owned by the United States." Suma went on to talk about the British withdrawal of troops stationed in China and expressed doubts about the need for foreign troops to continue to be stationed in Shanghai to maintain law and order, saying that there are now two factors to be noted on this issue: (1) the Japanese army is now responsible for maintaining law and order in its occupied areas; (2) whether any parts of China still need to station foreign troops to maintain law and order is very doubtful.</p>

<h3>Water and Electricity Company Strike Workers Returned to Work Yesterday: White Russian and Jewish Refugees All Stopped Being Hired, Resolution Terms Not Disclosed by Either Party</h3>
<p>The labor dispute between the British-owned Water and Electricity Company and its workers, which lasted for almost a month, was finally resolved yesterday. However, neither party is willing to disclose the terms of the resolution. The details are learned as follows:</p>
<p>Lasting Nearly a Month</p>
<p>Since the company fired worker Yang Hanzhang for a pretext on the 19th of last month, the workers made demands to the company to improve their treatment, but were rejected, which led to a go-slow strike. On the 20th, workers and staff at the Yangshupu New Plant also started a go-slow strike to help the workers. The strike has lasted for nearly a month. Although Gu Bingyuan of the Municipal Council's Industrial Section mediated, it was impossible to mediate because the attitudes of both parties were firm, resulting in a deadlock. Later, Yu Qiaqing mediated, and after several negotiations, the two sides gradually had a chance to approach each other. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the employee representatives suddenly notified all workers to return to work at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and the staff also resumed work at 8:00 AM today. The representatives also told the employees that the strike has been resolved.</p>
<p>Returned to Work Yesterday</p>
<p>All the workers returned to the factory to work at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, while the one hundred or so White Russians and fifty or so Jewish refugees hired by the Yangshupu New Plant went to the main office on Yu Qiaqing Road at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to settle their wages. According to the workers, the company has now stopped hiring these workers. All employees also went to the office as usual this morning to work.</p>
<p>Terms Revealed</p>
<p>According to the workers, the details of the resolution of this strike are not yet known in detail. According to the news revealed by the representatives, several employee representatives will be fired by the company. Regarding the improvement of treatment, the company authorities have agreed to implement it in accordance with the electricity company's method. The company has agreed to pay the salaries for July, but the salaries for the go-slow strike period from August 1st will be deducted.</p>
<h3>Public Settlement Continues to Be on Alert: Barbed Wire Only Sets Up Gaps</h3>
<p>The Public Settlement Police Department, in order to ensure the maintenance of law and order within the Settlement due to the holding of foreign military conferences on the 15th and the spread of rumors since the withdrawal of British troops stationed in Shanghai, is continuing to implement general security measures. According to a visit by a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday morning, the barbed wire fences at the Bund, Sichuan Road, the San Mao Ge Bridge, Dongxin Bridge, and the section where Qiaqing Road meets the French Concession have not been removed. The Chinese and Western detectives stationed on both sides are also performing inspection work as usual, which is quite thorough. However, the British troops and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps who assisted in the defense during the special alert have been withdrawn, and the barbed wire fences arranged at the southern end of Chongqing Road, Chengdu Road, and Avenue Haig have long been moved to the roadside to restore traffic. All security measures in the French Concession were completely removed at 11:00 PM on the 14th. However, in order to maintain order within the territory, the police station's patrol cars and Chinese and Western detectives continue to depart in shifts.</p>
<h3>High Tide Again from the 18th: Hurricane Far from Shanghai</h3>
<p>Two new hurricanes have occurred in the Pacific Ocean. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the first hurricane is currently located in the Pacific Ocean at 15 degrees north latitude and 130 degrees east longitude, and the second hurricane has advanced to 15 degrees north latitude and 134 degrees east longitude, also in the Pacific Ocean, far from Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to the news learned by the Datong News Agency reporter from the Bureau of Navigation and Dredging, according to the Bureau's forecast, there will be a high tide in the Huangpu River again starting from the 18th, measuring 11 feet, 6 and a half inches on the 18th, 11 feet, 6 inches on the 19th, 11 feet, 3 inches on the 10th, 10 feet and 9 and a half inches on the 21st, 10 feet and 2 and one-tenth inches on the 22nd, and it will start to recede below 10 feet from the 23rd. During the high tide, there is deep fear that it will coincide with a hurricane.</p>
<h3>The International Corps Bravely Defends Against the Heat; Caisewitz Expresses Gratitude in a Letter</h3>
<p>Caisewitz, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, yesterday sent a letter to Hempton, the Commander of the International Corps, expressing his sincere gratitude for the Corps members' assistance in maintaining order within the Settlement during the recent period of heightened alert surrounding the third anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai. The letter stated, in part, "On behalf of my colleagues within the Council and myself, I hereby extend our gratitude to Your Commander and ask that you convey our thanks to the members of the International Corps. The value of their work during the special alert period is known to all. We are deeply grateful for the enthusiastic assistance of all members, especially under the present sweltering heat."</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaolin's Funeral Held Yesterday; Over a Thousand People Participated in Carrying the Coffin; The Coffin Temporarily Placed in the Chinese Funeral Home</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaolin, a prominent figure in Shanghai, after being shot and killed by his bodyguard Lin Huaibu at approximately 1:45 PM the day before yesterday (the 14th), was given a grand funeral at his residence yesterday at 2:30 PM.</p>
<p>Condolences from Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries</p>
<p>Over a thousand people from all walks of life came to offer their condolences. Among the foreigners were the French Consul-General, O'Jen; former Director-General of the International Settlement, Fankerlin; the French Chief of Police, Fa Pei'er; and other heads of various departments. Among the Chinese were Yu Qiaqing, Wen Lanting, Feng Bingnan, Li Shihao, Huang Jinrong, Yuan Lvdeng, Lin Kanghou, Pan Zixin, Pan Xulun, Yan Chuntang, Gan Yuesong, Cai Hongsheng, Xi Ehan, and Xie Baosheng, all close friends of the deceased during his lifetime. It is understood that all unfinished matters from Zhang's life will be handled by his eldest son, Fayao.</p>
<p>Extravagant Funeral</p>
<p>Immediately following the encoffining, the funeral procession commenced. Participating in carrying the coffin were representatives from various charitable organizations, such as the Orphanages and Children's Education Centers, each sending marching bands. Temples such as the Fuzang Temple and the Jade Buddha Temple also sent numerous monks. There were five to six hundred floral wreaths from various sectors. Over a hundred streamers were carried. Monks and Taoist priests rode in trucks, while male and female guests traveled in over twenty chartered buses. Over a hundred private cars followed in the procession, with plain vehicles and white horses, showing extreme honor and sorrow. In terms of security, the French Concession's reserve teams, transportation office, and police officers from the French General Police Station were heavily armed and on alert. When the coffin passed through Avenue Foch, the Public Concession police authorities also dispatched detectives to patrol the route. At the entrance of the Chinese Funeral Home, the French Concession specially placed an armored car for protection. Zhang's coffin was temporarily placed in a newly constructed room within the Funeral Home, arriving safely at 3:45 PM. The funeral procession returned after 4:30 PM.</p>
<p>Criminal Record of the Assassin</p>
<p>The assassin, Lin Huaibu, was hired in April of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), introduced by driver Wang Wenliang, who was Lin's adopted son. It was discovered that Lin's father had previously served as a battalion commander under He Fenglin, the Military Governor of Songhu, and had considerable friendship with Zhang during his lifetime. Lin was originally a ne'er-do-well, with a violent temper. He had previously served as a Chinese constable in both Concession police forces, number 147 in the French Concession. He was dismissed for committing crimes, but he possessed a skill unmatched by ordinary people: marksmanship. He was accurate within dozens of steps. After being introduced to his employer by Wang Wenliang, he was hired as a bodyguard. When Zhang accompanied Lin to the police station to apply for a gun license, a Western officer at the police station told Zhang that Lin had committed crimes in both Concessions and should not be hired. Zhang at the time believed that if Lin could truly repent and be given a chance to reform, he would be able to do so. Alas, the opportunity was short-lived, and this tragedy occurred. Driver Wang Wenliang ("A Si from Nanjing") is still detained by the police, who are continuing their investigation.</p>
<p>Six Bodyguards Detained</p>
<p>Zhang's son, Fayao, reported to the police that after the assassin Lin Huaibu fired the first shot upwards in the courtyard, striking down his father, the other bodyguards stood idly by. They neither rushed to apprehend the assassin, nor grabbed the weapon from his hand, nor fired their own weapons to bring the assassin down. They allowed the assassin to run upstairs and continue firing, killing two more people. Therefore, he could not help but suspect collusion. He reported the situation to the police the day before yesterday, providing details and requesting a thorough investigation of all domestic employees to clarify the true circumstances of the assassin's actions. Upon receiving the report, the police chief dispatched detectives to Zhang's residence that evening, taking six bodyguards and one female servant back to the police station for investigation.</p>

<h3>Koukeng Estuary Virtually Blockaded; The Moufuk Ship Has Already Turned Back; Vertical Blockade of the Oujiang Estuary Halts Navigation; Despite Customs Clearance, the Guanwai Ship Still Intends to Sail Directly</h3>
<p>Shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang has become extremely bleak since the constant obstruction by Japanese warships. After being intercepted and inspected by Japanese warships outside the Koukeng Estuary, the shipping department of the German company Ritsuyo &amp; Company ship, Moufuk, the Japanese officer on board notified the ship's German owner to quickly leave the vertical blockade line from Yuhuan to Qianshan Island to the Pingyang vicinity. Due to the obstruction by Japanese warships, the ship departed at 6 AM yesterday and returned to Shanghai. The company has received a telegram stating that it can arrive in port today. However, the foreign ship believes that the area is not on the no-navigation list, and since customs has already granted clearance, it should sail. Therefore, the intentionally ship, Mabeiya, still sailed to Koukeng at 10 AM yesterday, according to the scheduled voyage. As for the Xinghua port in Fujian, after being re-blocked by the Japanese side, the ships docked at Sanjiangkou have returned to Shanghai one after another. The British company Eglon &amp; Company's ship, Shenyou, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, unloading the cargo and passengers that had been returned at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong.</p>
<p>Passengers to North China Must Have Epidemic Prevention Certificates</p>
<p>According to shipping industry news, from yesterday, Taikoo Company requires passengers traveling to North China on its ships to have a smallpox vaccination certificate issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department in order to purchase tickets. Those holding smallpox vaccination certificates issued by the Hongkou "Epidemic Prevention Association" or any other doctor will be refused the purchase of tickets to North China.</p>
<p>Shenhua Robbed; Passengers Demand Compensation</p>
<p>British company Eglon &amp; Company issued a public notice yesterday stating that the Shenhua ship was unfortunately robbed outside of Sanjiangkou on its return to Shanghai. It is scheduled to unload the remaining cargo from the robbery this morning (the 16th). The company has hired a maritime notary, who will be carrying out the inspection at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong from the 20th. Please, cargo owners, bring your bills of lading on that day to attend to the verification process. This is to inform you." It has been verified that among the passengers on board the Eglon &amp; Company's Shenhua ship who were robbed, there were about 100 people from Fujian. Representatives of the victims, Zheng Fenfei and Xu Tianlu, appealed to the Fujian Fellow Association about the tragic situation of the robbery, believing that Eglon &amp; Company was seriously at fault and demanding serious negotiations, requesting that the company compensate for the losses. The Fellow Association convened an emergency meeting at 4 PM yesterday, chaired by Chi Yunfei. Chi proposed organizing a Fujian Fellow Association's Rescue Committee for People Displaced by the Shenhua Robbery, which was passed. Jiang Yinan was elected as the chairman of the committee, and Chi Yunfei as the vice-chairman. It was also resolved that (1) the Rescue Committee of the Fujian Fellow Association would allocate 300 yuan to be used as temporary expenses to send personnel to the Asian and Peace Hotels to investigate the actual situation of the affected compatriots; (2) it was reported that when the Shenhua ship entered behind Nanri Island on the 7th, the local passengers on the ship strongly advised the driver not to stop, but the ship refused. Therefore, the company should be responsible for this accident. According to Zheng Fenfei, a passenger on the ship who returned from the bandit den, when the ship arrived near Nanri Island on the afternoon of the 7th, someone discovered four sailboats and a motorboat lurking ahead and urged them to increase their speed to escape, but it was unsuccessful. On the afternoon of the 8th at 5 PM, the sailboats and motorboats sailed straight over. One bandit on the ship was wearing a foreign military uniform, and others were in Western suits and plain clothes. After boarding, they forced them to show the cargo manifest and then proceeded to rob them. Three Jewish people (professors at the Fujian Music Academy), the ship's radio operator, another customs officer, and a priest were all arrested. Zheng was originally a student and happened to meet a bandit who had been a student, so he asked to go to the bandit den to retrieve his books, which was granted. Zheng followed the bandit boat and arrived half an hour later, realizing that the bandit den was a peninsula called Nanxia Maoyu. He also stated that there were still eight women and children being held and had not been released, while the Jewish people and he were released at the same time, each given 50 yuan for travel expenses.</p>
<p>Guangzhou Bay Still Transporting Goods as Usual</p>
<p>Most of the crew members of the British Taikoo Company's ships sailing to the South Seas also serve Guangzhou Bay. However, recently, because ships sailing to that place can only dock on the north shore and passengers cannot disembark on the north shore, the company has stopped selling tickets to Guangzhou Bay. However, it is understood that cargo to Guangzhou Bay is still allowed to be shipped, but the freight must be doubled as a refund fee. If the ship can unload goods in Guangzhou Bay, the increased double freight fee can be reclaimed from the company.</p>
<h3>Mackery Road Robbery Case; Three Thieves Apprehended; Two Thieves Shot, One Captured Alive</h3>
<p>At around 7 AM yesterday morning, six robbers suddenly arrived at No. 25, Lane 146, Rue Méquignon, four of them holding pistols. A female robber led the way, tricking the residents into opening the gate and entering the house, going straight to the second floor, brandishing guns to intimidate the family. They robbed over six hundred yuan in cash, a gold bracelet, a gold ring, and other jewelry, worth over one thousand yuan in total. As they fled, the family of the house followed and sounded the alarm for the police. The robbers noticed this and opened fire along the way to resist arrest. The police then blew the whistle and fired back. Soon, nearby police and armored car patrols received the news and came to encircle and arrest them. Both sides fired over ten shots, resulting in two robbers being shot and falling near the Xiaocai Chang side, one shot in the arm and one in the thigh. They were apprehended on the spot, and two pistols were seized. Another robber, named Chen Shengyou, was captured alive by a passerby while fleeing. The remaining robbers took the opportunity to escape. It has been verified that the house is inhabited by a local man named Xu Jiaping, and the second-floor residents who were robbed were three tenants.</p>
<h3>Kunming Builds a Leprosy Hospital; Shanghai Association Contributes 10,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>On August 12, the China Leprosy Relief Association, through its Executive Committee, approved the letter from the Yunnan Provincial Health Laboratory, approving a subsidy of 10,000 yuan in national currency to build a "new type of leprosy hospital" in Kunming. In addition, 2,000 yuan in national currency was allocated to be used as the operating expenses for the provincial mobile leprosy relief team.</p>
<h3>Japanese Man and Woman Hang Themselves Inside the Jiangwan Racecourse; Man Named Kobayashi Yasuyoshi, Woman Named Kobama</h3>
<p>She Wen She reported that at around 2 PM on the 15th, two Japanese men and women were suddenly found to have hanged themselves inside the Jiangwan Racecourse. After the case occurred, the Japanese immediately sent personnel to investigate. It was discovered that the man was named Kobayashi Yasuyoshi, 32 years old, and the woman was named Kobama, 24 years old. Kobayashi lived at No. 44, Gongan Lane, Hamilton Road. He had embezzled a large sum of 10,000 yuan from the company he worked for and had defrauded Nakamura Cooperative on North Sichuan Road of 3,000 yuan. However, the reason why the two hanged themselves at the same time is unknown. The Japanese are currently investigating. It is said that Kobama was Kobayashi's mistress.</p>
<h3>Axe Murder on Avenue Joffre, Baokang Lane; Victim Wu Gaoyou Struck Six or Seven Times with an Axe; Head Nearly Severed; Extremely Tragic</h3>
<p>At 10:30 PM the night before last, a case of murder by axe suddenly occurred at No. 59, Baokang Lane, Avenue Joffre. The resident of the house was Wu Gaoyou, a 52-year-old man from Suzhou, who had lived at the address for three to five years. At the time of the incident, two men entered, claiming to see Wu to discuss something. They went straight to the second floor. Wu happened to be in the room and stood up when he heard the sound. Unexpectedly, one of the men grabbed Wu's clothing and the other pulled out a sharp axe, violently striking Wu six or seven times. He was struck in the head, chest, and other places and fell into a pool of blood. The murderer finally struck a blow to the neck, causing his head to nearly fall off, a very tragic scene. The two murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, abandoned the axe and fled. Afterwards, Wu's family reported the incident to the police station, and the deceased was transported to the mortuary for examination.

<h3>Finance The New York Pound Rises Again, Now Equal to the Official London Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for foreign exchange: HSBC's listed prices showed no change. The black market for British-American exchange had nothing particularly exciting to report. The underlying trend remained mixed between tight and loose. The reason was that the New York pound rose again, now equal to the official exchange rate of London against the US dollar. Furthermore, the results of the defense meeting were considered satisfactory. American banks and Chinese merchant speculators were supplying heavily, and exporters were also selling, causing the US dollar to temporarily strengthen to $5.51125 for settlement.

Afterwards, because HSBC had an appetite to eat, and the British American Tobacco Company also slightly needed to settle, the trend softened. At one point, the spot US exchange tightened to $5.4375.

British gold was 3 shillings and 7 03125 pence, and the US exchange was $5.46875, without any change compared to the morning opening.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Unstable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market conditions were unstable. The exchange market was loose and flat, with no power to rise, and ultimately fell. However, morale was not decadent, only lacking the courage to search for opportunities, resulting in few people maintaining the price when it fell. In the early morning, it was still $5,810. A certain gold shop first offered to sell down to $5,790. Later, money exchange silver shops bought in, returning to $5,810. However, the gold shop group came again to aggressively sell, and the silver shops instead saw selling offers. At that time, there were very few buyers, and it plummeted to $5,760. Before the noon closing, fortunately a certain gold shop profited by covering shorts, and relying on the softening of the exchange market at that time, it gradually pulled up by thirty or forty yuan. The noon closing was $5,782. The post-market situation was even more sluggish, and it opened at $5,775, and briefly rose a few yuan. Ultimately, due to the continued strength of foreign exchange, silver shops and money changers sold together, falling back to $5,770. The evening closing was only $5,772, down thirty-five yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day's transactions were approximately 20 taels. Jewelry gold was listed down ten yuan, and customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Falls 35 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially had good morale, and the market situation was stable and flat. First, the money exchange industry sold 10 taels from the gold shop, for $5,810, a slight increase of three yuan compared to the previous day. Because the gold shop group sold, the Yin Tiehao immediately sold 20 taels to the money exchange industry, for $5,790. Then, relying on a certain money exchange industry and silver shop buying in, it pulled back to the high price of $5,810. However, the gold shop group still had a strong intention to sell, and the money exchange industry and silver shop also tended to sell, and it once retreated to the low price of $5,760. However, soon the sellers gradually decreased, and a certain money exchange industry and a certain gold shop profited by covering shorts, and the exchange market also reported tightening, so it saw $5,800 again before the closing. However, foreign exchange reported loose and flat again, so the price was difficult to pull up. By the time of the closing, it retreated to $5,782. In the afternoon, the gold shop's initial opening selling was slightly down by seven yuan. The gold shop sold 20 taels to the silver shop, for $5,775. Then, relying on the securities group and money exchange industry to absorb, it raised to $5,783. However, the silver shop sold again and again, and at that time a certain money exchange industry also came to sell, so it was pressed down to $5,770. However, the evening closing was $5,772. As a result, it was drastically down by thirty-five yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day fluctuated by fifty yuan. The cash shop's listed gold selling price was higher than the spot gold by more than ten yuan, and the buying price was lowered by thirty yuan. The current bid gold was more than fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed Down Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael from the silver shop initially remained at $600 at Datongxing. Then, at 10:20 AM, it was listed down ten yuan. After that, there was no change. It was calculated that Datongxing changed to listing $590. The new counterpart's price was similar to the above price, and the buying price was lowered by about thirty yuan.</p>
<h3>Ample Cash, Discount Rate Plummets Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts plummeted sharply. This was because cash has recently been very ample. The morning discount rate had already retreated to 40 yuan per thousand, and 42 yuan for selling. In the afternoon, the discount rate fell to only 31 yuan, and selling was only 33 yuan, down a sharp ten yuan compared to the previous day. The money industry association's interbank lending rate was also down one point. The morning and afternoon markets were both listed at 14 points, it was said.</p>
<h3>Securities The Defense Issue Resolved, Encouraging Domestic Debt</h3>
<p>The securities black market, yesterday's market conditions fluctuated greatly. Initially, it fell due to rumors that the national salvation bonds would suspend interest payments for three years. Then, it rose because the defense area issue in this city had been properly resolved. The discount market suddenly plummeted, falling from 46 to within 29 yuan. In the bond market, each household had a relatively large appetite, and morale was increasingly excited. The losses in the morning were more than compensated for by the gains in the afternoon. The initial opening yesterday morning was only because Renchang, Hongkang, and Lianyi bought a lot, so the opening price was very firm. Hengfu had quite a supply. Then, it gradually weakened because Tongkang, Hongda, Yongxiang, and Zhongyi sold. Lianhe's unloading was particularly heavy. Type A broke 60 yuan, and Type C and E also broke into the 50 yuan mark. Hengfu suddenly bought in at the initial opening in the afternoon, a relatively large amount. Hongkang followed, and its appetite was also not weak. Therefore, Hongda covered shorts, Lianyi and Renchang increased their positions, and Xinfu and Shuntai followed. Tongkang and Zhongyi continued to sell, and Zhenkang, Tongji, Yichang, and Dafeng also supplied one after another. But the market price had already risen sharply. As a result, Types A, B, and C rose two or three corners compared to the previous day, and the rest were stable transactions. The total volume was approximately 1.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transaction, 200 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity stock were traded, the price was $5.95.</p>

<h3>Food Grain The Price of Foreign Rice Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market suddenly turned tight. The reason was that after the previous drop, it suddenly aroused a wave of covering shorts. For a time, blind followers were endless, and the situation was particularly precarious. Afterwards, after further active trading by inland groups and local shops, the prices of various goods had already risen by more than one yuan amidst the shouts of peddlers. It was not until near noon that the sales market weakened, and some profiteers took advantage of the high prices to unload their inventory, and the market showed a slight decline, appearing slightly soft. However, the closing price was still up by half a yuan to nearly one yuan compared to the previous market. It was calculated that No. 1 Aged Saigon was 58 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the lifting of martial law in the concessions, foreign rice had a slight demand in the actual sales in this city. Also, after continuous declines in recent days, the sellers were unwilling to sell at lower prices again, and inland and village stockpiles also slightly absorbed at flat prices. Therefore, the market gradually improved. As for the original packaged rice, it lacked the original support and replenishment, and there were no large households absorbing. Both peddlers and hoarders rarely inquired. The entire market was only slightly active by floating households. The total transaction volume was only over 100 tons. Therefore, while spot foreign rice rebounded by 70 or 80 cents to around one yuan, the original package only followed the good by 30 or 40 cents. No. 2 Saigon was suppressed down to $61.5 in the early market by the bulls, then returned to $62.5. No. 2 Siam also opened at $62.5, and the transfer fee was $64.</p>
<p>Although early and glutinous domestic rice arrived, it was still not prosperous. There were only 700 or 800 bags, but regardless of the clear or black market transactions, rumors were still not smooth, so the price was difficult to keep pace with foreign rice, with not much rise or fall. Changshu Xianqing japonica was still 66-67 yuan. Wuxi Qing japonica was 65.5 yuan, 65 yuan. Changzhou Su Kun japonica was high from around 64 yuan, the next was 62-63 yuan, and Suzhou was around 60 yuan. Nangang original package early rice was 62.5 yuan, 61.5 yuan. Husk was 59.5 yuan, 58.5 yuan. Yanjian was 48 yuan. The domestic glutinous rice market lacked high-quality goods. Only Jinli big market was Yuan, opening at 61 yuan, 60 yuan and 7 cents, Changdan Baiyuan 58-9 yuan, Hong Kong Teyuan 59.5 yuan, 59 yuan, big market 57-8 yuan, next 55-5 yuan, and Moyuan around 51-2 yuan. The source of Zhoupu new japonica was gradually increasing, with 40-50 shi yesterday. Gaozhu was lacking, and Zhongguan was the majority, so the market seemed tight and the price opened at 61 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Industry on the Verge of Extinction Fuxin Plant Has Been Closed for Three Days</h3>
<p>The people of North China are accustomed to eating flour, so the number of flour shipments to the north each year is several times greater than rice. However, since the July 7th Incident, North China was the first to fall, resulting in all food grains being controlled. The flour from Fuxin and Fufeng plants in this city has been stopped from being shipped north for a long time. The current shipments are all products of the Japanese "Sanxin Plant." This Sanxin Plant was originally Fuxin No. 3 Plant, which was changed to Japanese Sanxin after being occupied. Today, the plant has 11,000 bags of flour being shipped to Weihaiwei, and 7,000 bags being shipped to Qingdao, which are being transported on the Japanese ship Taichung Maru. It is also heard that last Monday, 24,000 bags were loaded onto the Haiping Lun for shipment to Tianjin. (Zu)</p>
<p>Fuxin has stopped for three days. Unless raw materials are supplied, it cannot be started up. Fufeng still has a small amount of wheat in stock, and is continuing to operate as usual. However, the flour market is now dominated by Japanese flour. It is heard that the Phoenix brand initially opened flat, then customers bought up September futures quite actively, and the price gradually rose. It is calculated that this month opened at 14 yuan 6 cents to 7 cents, and September 14 yuan from 7 cents 8 cents to 8 cents half. More than 3,000 bags were transacted. Foreign flour and domestic flour transactions are temporarily quiet. The Chinese flour plant's price is still 15 yuan. More than 3,000 bags were wholesaled by Yifeng.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat was as flat as ever. Chinese plants are unable to smoothly collect due to transportation being blocked. Japanese plants have a strong appetite, and they are especially focusing on eating. Therefore, the market price is still more than 20 yuan, with different prices. The Sanxin plant collected 3,500 to 600 bags. It is heard that the Chinese plant's collection price must be 22 yuan and 34 cents. The number is only 40 to 50 bags to 100 to 200 bags. The market opening may still be waiting.</p>
<h3>The Renewal of China's Silk Industry</h3>
<p>— De</p>
<p>(C) The Situation of Improvement</p>
<p>The attempt to improve China's silk industry is carried out by the International Trade Commission established for this purpose. That is, first import into China the Japanese white cocoon species--this is named the Japanese imported into China species, and improved. The result would be generating standard silkworm eggs free of genetic diseases. These varieties generally intermingle white cocoon monovoltine and white cocoon bivoltine. For the sake of the success of this enterprise, the committee also sends propagandists to various places to guide the improvement methods of silkworm rearing, to educate silkworm farmers. As such, this enterprise will have excellent achievements. However, the silk produced by the majority of silkworm farmers is still extremely coarse, and also lacks a clear degree, so there is still no effective result on the species.</p>
<p>Last year, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, the National Economic Council established the Silkworm Silk Improvement Committee to study the location of its harms. Last year, the committee also established an experimental institute in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, to carry out various experiments, especially to explore the results of intermingling with European species. The silkworms necessary for its experiments almost include all types, which are collected from all over the country. However, the experimental institute in Chengdu lacks sufficient equipment to implement specially made plans, so it is further supplemented by the establishment of an experimental institute in the capital Chongqing.</p>
<p>The work of this new experimental institute in the capital has already begun. Its purpose is naturally to try to produce improved silkworm species. Therefore, it collects about 2,500 kilowatts of silkworms, half of which are Guangdong species and Sichuan species. Judging from the experience of the last two years, the improvement seems to have made considerable progress.</p>
<p>As for the experimental outline of the Chongqing Experimental Institute, it is as follows.</p>
<p>(A) Monovoltine</p>
<p>(1) The silk produced in the autumn of 1939 and 1938 is mostly crepes of poor quality, so it is appropriate to recombine some Chinese white cocoon species, and carefully select their mixing and changes.</p>
<p>(2) Intermingle the Chinese white cocoon monovoltine and polyvoltine with the European system.</p>
<p>(3) In order to carry out large-scale experiments with white mixed species, provide the species to silkworm farmers.</p>
<p>(4) Regardless of the presence or absence of fine hair, pure and mixed white cocoon monovoltine and colored monovoltine should continue to be developed.</p>
<p>(5) Improve the colored Hubei species.</p>
<p>(6) Investigate and select the collected new self-cocoon species.</p>
<p>(7) Improve the yellow and peach colors collected in the north and west in 1939.</p>
<p>(8) Intermingle the white orchid species in the west and north of our country with the European white cocoon species.</p>
<p>(9) Intermingle white cocoon species with the white cocoon species in the middle.</p>
<p>(10) Fix new cocoons by means of mixing and intermingling.</p>
<p>(B) Polyvoltine in Guangdong</p>
<p>(1) Continue to improve the polyvoltine of Guangdong white species.</p>
<p>(2) Change the pure mixed species obtained in 1939 into bivoltine or monovoltine.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to the use of pure species of spring, summer, and autumn silkworms in several silk-making places.</p>
<p>In addition, various experiments have been spent on the determination of mulberry leaves. Precise investigations are made on the feeding period of new improved species, the amount of mulberry leaf consumption, and the amount of silkworm silk produced. Finally, in order to guide silkworm farmers in rural areas and train silkworm egg manufacturers, it has also begun to train propagandists and instructors.</p>
<p>Judging from the above, if China's silk industry can progress step by step, the future hope is indeed unlimited. (End)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Control Becomes More Acute</h3>
<p>The supply of miscellaneous grains in this port is interrupted and irregular because it is an isolated island and is controlled by others. The market conditions fluctuate greatly. Recently, the control situation has become more acute, resulting in a lack of sources and a depletion of inventory. The overall situation is gradually tightening. All kinds of market prices are rising. Recently, soybeans have also been absorbed by Japanese merchants, and the top-quality goods have rushed through the 20 yuan mark. Yesterday, Wujiang Qing silkworms opened from 11 yuan to 19 yuan and 50 cents, with more than 1,000 bags transacted. Beigang Maojia City Qing silkworms were 20 yuan and 7 cents to 50 cents, with 400 bags transacted. Jiading white silkworms were 500 bags, the price was 20 yuan. Chongming sand silkworms were hundreds of bags, 17 yuan and 50 cents. Although soybeans saw new ones, subsequent batches were not received, so the underlying trend was rising rather than falling. Yesterday, 500 bags of Anqing beans were traded, the price is detailed in the market price column. Wuhu beans were more than 100 bags, Sangyuan beans were 200 bags, and Pudong Du beans were more than 300 bags. Other Dalian beans and Qingdao beans were traded secretly. At the moment, the downstream is still the Nanyang Bunjie two gangs.</p>
<p>1,990 bags of beans were shipped to Hong Kong on the 17th, and 730 bags were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Transshipment of Coarse White, Guangdong Gang Imports 2,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market's trend felt quite firm because the Guangdong gang absorbed 2,000 bags of transshipped 24 coarse white. The association's listed prices for spot 24 coarse white were 72 yuan and 7 cents to 73 yuan in this godown, up 6 cents, new goods from outside godowns were 72 yuan and 5 cents, old goods were 72 yuan, up 3 cents, transshipment goods were 56 yuan and 8 cents to 57 yuan and 5 cents for delivery on the 22nd, up 2 cents, 58 yuan for delivery on the 29th, the Guangdong gang exclusively imported 2,000 bags, Dutch cotton white KD mark was 72 yuan and 1 cent, up 1 cent, Dutch red mark was 59 yuan and 8 cents to 60 yuan, up 6 cents, Taikoo wheel white had not much rise or fall, B mark was 75 yuan and 3 cents, DY mark was 72 yuan and 6 cents, HX mark was 72 yuan, H mark wheel red was slightly loose, at 58 yuan and 1 cent. Guotang had Guangbang opening 118 bags of Dongxiang red, 58 yuan and 5 cents, and 200 pieces of Huayou bags, 52 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Cotton Yarn Inventory Has Advances Without Retreats Shuangma's Smallest is 872 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose, and the trend was slightly stabilized. At the same time, the Hong Kong help purchased, and it was heard that in addition to 1,400 bags, the bulls' intention turned to invigorate. However, it is said that this help also contains speculative nature (what the inside story is, it is still not known). In short, in the past two days, the decline was huge, outside of 100 yuan, and the new buyers were brave and active. However, the yarn in stock is still in a state of advancing without retreating.</p>
<p>Because morale was not good at the opening of the yarn market in the morning, the scalpers all sold off, so the situation softened. The price of 20-count Shuangma was 8880 yuan, falling to 72 yuan, hovering outside of 80 yuan for a long time. Then it was heard that the Shanghai defense area issue had been peacefully resolved after the Five Nations Conference. As a result, morale was greatly shaken, and the shorts covered their positions, and the market gradually moved forward, rising to 914 yuan at the close. Afterwards, it fell slightly. It was found that 3,510 bags were transacted in half a day. The price of 20-count Shuangma fell 10 yuan and 5 cents. Today, 775 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, and 150 pieces were shipped to Haikou. The amount bought by each help is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Colleagues 2,030</p>

<p>Hong Kong 1,450</p>
<p>Statistics 3,520</p>
<h3>The Cotton Market Remains Weary as Before</h3>
<p>The spot cotton transaction is particularly sluggish. The manufacturers' needs are very clear. As for colleagues, in view of the small hope in the yarn market, the interest in mutual buying and selling is indifferent, so the market has entered a hesitating phase again. The market is still tired and depressed.</p>
<p>Another message, the price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, the market conditions are firm, and later the shape is unusually active. Spot trading has also slightly improved. A part of the shorts covered their positions. As a result, the closing price rose slightly by one or two pounds compared to the previous day. India, including forecasts, rose by two rupees.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading, yesterday, because the results of the defense meeting were still satisfactory, morale suddenly turned to stability, and yarn prices also rebounded. Therefore, the cotton market has turned firm again. Although transactions were quiet yesterday, colleagues' thoughts are good again.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Purchases Turn Prosperous by Noon</h3>
<p>The cloth market was tired in the morning and firm at noon. First, due to the downward trend of the previous day, floating households scrambled to unload, and buyers watched. The downward trend was quite dramatic. However, near noon, the results of the defense meeting were released, and morale turned to stability. The local guest help's actual needs each household immediately started purchasing, and the market atmosphere turned firm. As a result, the market fell by one or two corners per piece compared to the previous day. The local street transacted more than 500 pieces. The Zhejiang help purchased more than 100 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and coarse cloth. The Guangdong-Hong Kong help purchased 150 to 60 pieces of twill and colored cloth. The Xi'an help purchased more than 1,000 pieces of printed and tribute, etc. Singapore and other places purchased more than 5,000 pieces of bleached and dyed cloth.</p>
<p>In the morning market of Dongbu, because the Tianjin help sold, it continued to fall. Longtou fine cloth fell to 30 yuan and 4 cents. Four Gentlemen Serge fell to 8 cents and 7 and a half. In the post-market, the colleagues in this street bought up the shorts, and the selling gradually increased. Longtou closed back to 30 yuan and 6 and a half cents, Serge 8 cents and 9 cents, compared with the previous day's ratio, the fine cloth fell by about 5 cents per piece again.</p>
<p>Piece goods exports on the 17th, 900 pieces shipped to Yantai, 40 pieces shipped to Tianjin, 595 pieces shipped to Hong Kong, 38 pieces shipped to Singapore, and 50 pieces shipped to Haimen.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials New Lily Bulb Slices Have Arrived</h3>
<p>A new batch of new lily bulb slices continued to arrive yesterday. Because the production price is tightening and the cost is increasing, samples have been seen, and the color is still good, but the identity is relatively soft. The market price is called up by 10 yuan, but there is still a lack of transactions. The big ones will have a regular market today, it is said.</p>
<h3>Hardware Wire Nails and Coils Are Slightly More Expensive</h3>
<p>The hardware market has been slightly lively in recent days. The reason is that the business of the foreign guest help is creeping, and the factories in this street are also buying and selling from time to time, so the atmosphere of the market is still good. The morale in the industry is thinking of showing, and the prices of various goods have been slightly invigorated. Wire nails and coils have also improved. It was found that coils are the raw material for making nails, so the rise and fall of coils mostly follow the rise and fall of wire nails. In the past, wire nails were cut off from Vietnam and the South Seas Islands, and the trend in this city was declining. At the same time, the asking price of coils also plummeted. Although the southern sales have not been smooth recently, the Tianjin help and inland merchants have been searching from time to time, so the market is slightly more expensive than before. Each barrel of Bessemer is 48 yuan, and the coils have also risen to 48 yuan per picul.</p>

<h3>Continued Pi Pa Xing with Preface</h3>
<p>Xu Yuzhen, formerly named Zhu Liqing, was a leading courtesan in Shanghai. In the autumn of the year Yi Hai, she married into the Yang family of Huzhou, but suffered from the fierce jealousy of the first wife, and her husband was also not good at mediating. After four years of marriage, she remained unfulfilled. Last autumn, hearing of her mother's illness, she returned by boat to Qinchuan. Soon after, her mother died, and her relatives, a certain Qi and others, seized all her belongings. She sued in court, but received no justice. After being idle for a while, she came to Shanghai to find her husband, but he ignored her. By then, her funds were exhausted, and having no one to rely on, she had no choice but to change her name and resume her old profession. Alas! A song of the pipa, tears fill the green robes of a sojourner; the strings and bamboo are retuned, still the red sleeves of yesteryear. Moved by her shared misfortune, I composed a long poem to record it.</p>
<p>Shanghai is originally a den of pleasure, where autumn chrysanthemums and spring orchids compete in beauty; year after year, the pursuit of beauty never ends, and weeping willows hang everywhere in the entertainment district. The Zhu family had a daughter of utmost purity and beauty, her jade face like a flower, her skin like snow; when dressed up, she always felt that rouge and powder were defiling, and when she sang, it was enough to shatter metal and stone. It was truly inappropriate for a beautiful flower to fall into a privy, and it was soon moved from a spring cage to the Golden Valley; dare to say that all merchants are only concerned with profit, but beauties have always been passionate. The elegant young master of the Yang family, with deep affection, even wished to die for love; their hearts were bound together, and they abandoned dancing fans and singing skirts as if they were worn-out shoes. A stream of water is not far away, and a golden house is a suitable place for a flower that understands words; who knew that suddenly a wave of jealousy would rise, and the lion king would roar, stirring up wind and sand. Ji Chang threw his staff, lost in his own mind, his masculine power no match for the rouge tiger; wanting to take her side, he felt powerless, letting the wind and rain ruin the flowers.</p>

<h3>Seeing Instead of Hearing</h3>
<p>— Rini</p>
<p>Among people with imperfect organs, besides the mute and the blind, the deaf are also very miserable; they are almost completely isolated from the world, only able to experience everything externally through their minds. They are not fortunate enough to enjoy beautiful music, the voices of friends, and other pleasant sounds, which is truly unfortunate!</p>
<p>In 1891, when Edward B. Nitchie was fifteen years old, he lost his hearing in both ears. He had thoughts of suicide, but then decided to live well. Soon after, as a result of diligent research, he discovered that lip movements and facial expressions are essential elements for the deaf to communicate with the non-deaf. The deaf, after training, can not only converse and laugh freely, but also completely understand the speech of others. Edward's "Lip Reading" is very effective, simple and interesting, and even very young children can understand it at a glance, so it is very popular. Funds were raised to open a school, which gradually developed into the New York League of today, which for twenty-five years has been considered the main source of "lip reading," influencing not only the United States, but also Canada, South America, and parts of Europe, where schools teaching lip reading have also been established.</p>
<p>Among the three million children in the United States, one million children underwent collective hearing tests in 1934, and it was found that the hearing of 80,000 children was worse than that of ordinary people. Among them, 10,000 children need to be treated with acoustic medicine, and 9,000 children have almost completely lost their hearing and must receive lip-reading training.</p>
<p>When teaching lip reading, teachers do not make any sound when speaking to students, but move their lips naturally as usual, neither too fast nor too slow. The teacher first writes words such as Sing, Wing, Ring, Say, Way, Ray, Seed, Weed, Reed, etc. on the blackboard. The teacher first reads them silently, and the students follow by reading them aloud. Or the teacher tells a story, and in addition to writing difficult new words on the blackboard, asks a silent question, but the students can often answer him aloud. This kind of training work gradually progresses from simple to complex, making it similar to daily conversation.</p>
<p>However, there is a significant difficulty in lip reading, which is that in daily conversation, 55% of the words are often uttered from the gaps between the teeth, the throat, or the bottom of the nose. Therefore, the use of the eyes must also be particularly sensitive, and precise thoughts must closely follow the eyes.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity of language, those who attend the League often need to have a specific target, such as being a clerk in a department store or an office worker in a writing room. The knowledge learned by the two is completely different. This kind of lip reading is quite effective, and many stores in the United States have hired deaf employees, whose abilities are no different from those of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Modern science is flourishing, and people's welfare has greatly increased. Many deaf people in China are probably still isolated from the world, so promoting lip reading seems to be an urgent task!</p>
<p>People</p>
<h3>Mr. Chen Jiageng</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiansan</p>
<p>Regarding the outstanding heroes of society, I most detest two kinds of superficially impressive roles: utilitarians and glory-seekers. Glory-seekers aim to steal fame and deceive the world, and can never produce anything of real value in their lives; while utilitarians are even more contemptible, with only "power" in their minds, busying themselves for personal gain, rejecting dissidents, and often degenerating into great traitors and villains who bring great harm to the people. What I have always admired are those who work silently and diligently, without boasting about their own achievements, and without eagerly seeking fame and fortune; what suffering China urgently needs at the moment is precisely this kind of people. Mr. Chen Jiageng, who destroyed his family to establish Xiamen University and Jimei Schools, is one of the best examples.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is from Jimei Village in Tongan County, Fujian Province. He is an overseas Chinese businessman in Southeast Asia and is now an elderly man over fifty. He is China's second Wu Xun, which everyone knows; at the same time, he is also the most respected overseas Chinese leader. When the war of resistance broke out, he was elected as the chairman of the "Nanyang Overseas Chinese Aid to the Motherland's War of Resistance Conference," leading hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese to serve the country loyally and spare no effort. This summer, he and a group of people, including Hou Xifan, flew all the way from Singapore to Chongqing to report on the overseas Chinese situation to the supreme leader and to慰劳 the anti-Japanese soldiers. Some chattering gossips said some idle words; in fact, a few mouthfuls of dog blood cannot knock down a man of perseverance like Mr. Chen. This is purely a rumor and slander. What negative effects did his trip have? To borrow a sentence he often uses to modestly say: "I am just fulfilling the duty of a citizen!"</p>
<p>Xunzi said, "When it comes to hard work, they compete to be first; when it comes to joyful things, they can yield." How many people in the world can truly achieve this? I have only seen one Mr. Chen. To give an example: five or six years ago, a British reporter went to interview Mr. Chen and highly praised Mr. Chen for creating Xiamen University and Jimei Schools, cultivating countless talents, and making huge contributions to the country. But Mr. Chen replied lightly, "This is the harvest of our hard-working educators in China. I am just fulfilling the duty of a citizen!" However, this is by no means comparable to the lip service of hypocrites. Mr. Chen never flaunts himself and only knows about the people. In British Singapore, he owns the Nanyang Business Daily and the General Compilation News. He does not regard them as his own private property, and he has never exaggeratedly created news about himself. "My purpose in running the newspaper is only to serve the overseas Chinese and to promote the war of resistance in the motherland." He once said this, and now his words have been confirmed.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is honest and trustworthy, meticulous and detailed, warm and sincere in dealing with people and things; he has the demeanor of a Confucian scholar, without the slightest trace of the stench of a "financial tycoon." He is not proficient in Mandarin and can only speak the Xiamen dialect, and his words are also simple and unadorned. He has been a businessman since childhood, and literature does not seem to be his forte. It is said that all his published articles and declarations were written by his secretary. However, these do not detract from Mr. Chen's brilliance, and he is still a most practical and noble person!</p>
<h3>The Fake Mother</h3>
<p>— Danian</p>
<p>Around 1870, when women in the United States were just starting to travel alone by train, many of them carried a tightly swaddled fake baby, or a large, crying doll. This made people think they were mothers. Not only could they easily find seats, but also lonely male passengers would not dare to have any other ambitions towards them.</p>
<h3>Hawthorne's Detective Case: The Ballerina's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>I also hurriedly told the driver to stop and asked him to turn the car around before stopping. While I was paying the fare, I saw Yu Gantang walking straight into a lane without looking back, clearly unaware that I was following him. I walked to the entrance of the lane and saw that it was Changming Lane, which was full of Shikumen residences, one up and one down. This lane was quite wide and very quiet. It did not have the noise of small lanes where five or six families lived in one house.</p>
<p>I saw Yu Gantang walking to the third Shikumen and walking straight in without knocking, as if the door was already open. I hurried to the door, which was indeed number two. One of the black lacquered doors was closed, and the other was half open. I hid myself behind the closed door and peeked inside. Inside was a living room, which was quite neatly arranged. A thin, tall young man was writing something on a square table. This person was wearing light-colored Western-style trousers and a light blue and white striped shirt. At this moment, he put down his pen and stood up to greet Yu Gantang.</p>
<p>"Gantang, how is it?"</p>
<p>"It was a wasted trip. He ran away."</p>
<p>"That's good, it's your good fortune. Give me that thing back."</p>
<p>"No, I must find him. ... Zhaoy, why are you so stingy? I'll pay you for each bullet."</p>
<p>I only put my ear to the door, and for the sake of caution, I didn't dare to look inside. However, from their conversation, it was very clear that the so-called "thing" and "bullet" were clearly guns. This gun was probably borrowed by Yu Gantang from this person named Zhaoqi. At this time, the person named Shu Zhaoxi let out a burst of laughter and then continued to speak.</p>
<p>"Gantang, you misunderstood. This is not a matter of money. I have always opposed your plan. I think it's too unworthy."</p>

<h3>Roar</h3>
<p>— Xu Yi</p>
<p>Thanks to the generosity of a friend, I was invited to see a circus.</p>
<p>When we stepped into the arena filled with foul odors, the first thing that shocked me was the loud roar; the roar seemed to carry anger, and it also seemed to carry sorrow. It turned out that the "circus" had already opened to the most intense scene.</p>
<p>Carrying a trembling heart and leaning on my friend's shoulders, I finally saw the lions and tigers that grew up in nature.</p>
<p>(But are the lions and tigers still in nature now?)</p>
<p>Opening their hungry mouths, opening their eyes like fierce flames, they resisted the cruel play of the "circus performers" with all their might. Finally, the tigers and lions, holding a heart that would never surrender, roared angrily at the ignorant people.</p>
<p>A few roars won the hearts of the audience, and people laughed with interest.</p>
<p>Roars and laughter formed a terrible story; this story contained too much irony, stabbing at my trembling heart.</p>
<p>I couldn't stand this pain, I stood up and begged my kind friend:</p>
<p>"Let's go."</p>
<h3>Experiences in Taking School Entrance Examinations</h3>
<p>— Bo</p>
<p>It is said that mathematics and physics and chemistry are the most difficult</p>
<p>According to students who have participated in the entrance examinations for universities and middle schools, the test questions are not very difficult, but the difficulty lies in the mathematics and physics and chemistry questions, which are impossible to start. You must be familiar with the principles before you can start, and relying on a few dead formulas is useless.</p>
<p>Most of the mathematics and science test questions are based on the foreign mathematics and science textbooks translated by Guangwenshe, such as Fan's Advanced Algebra, Boatai Practical Physics, etc. These books are the most popular standard textbooks in domestic middle schools, so the test questions of various schools are based on these.</p>
<p>In order to improve students' learning efficiency and facilitate preparation for entrance examinations, Guangwenshe hired experts to compile a set of problem solutions for these textbooks. The solutions are accurate, detailed, and concise, which is unmatched by other problem solution books. This problem solution book is the most helpful for self-study or taking entrance examinations for universities and middle schools.</p>
<p>The price of the problem solutions is very cheap. Fan's Advanced Algebra Problem Solution is 2.7 yuan, Boatai Practical Physics Problem Solution is 2 yuan, Bokan Practical Chemistry Problem Solution is 1.8 yuan, Three S Plane Geometry Problem Solution is 2.4 yuan, Three S Solid Geometry Problem Solution is 0.9 yuan, Ge's Plane Trigonometry Problem Solution is 2.2 yuan, and Analytical Geometry Problem Solution is 2.2 yuan. All are sold by the World Book Company, and a detailed catalog can be obtained from the company.</p>

<h3>America Promotes Moral Films</h3>
<p>— Huazhi</p>
<p>Sexy Stars Tremble at the News</p>
<p>In recent years, Hollywood's sexy films have emerged one after another, and sexy movie stars have competed for beauty. Although they are praised by general low-taste people, they do have considerable gains in business: but after all, they are despised by general righteous moral people in society. Therefore, the movement to reorganize moral films has been brewing in the United States for a long time, and now it has been concretely realized.</p>
<p>The moral film movement headquarters is located in Washington, and its promoters include celebrities, scholars, reporters, and pastors, all of whom are known for their strong and unyielding spirit. The first film in the plan is named "Wake Up, American Compatriots." It is said that the content of the film is to reject the sexy style, especially the "Oops Girl" Ann Sheridan. The female lead candidate for the film was publicly selected in Audukwei City, Florida, and named "Miss Special," to distinguish her from ordinary ear-covering and bell-stealing Miss Queen and the like. The film's pure purpose has the style of our country's national film "Confucius."</p>
<p>On the other hand, Ann Sheridan, the "Oops Girl" who despises everything, heard that she was being besieged on all sides and was about to become the target of moralists, and she was also trying to change her style on the surface. She advocated not showing her thighs or any part of her body, so that people would have no excuse to be sexy. Therefore, she decided to act in more costume dramas. In her new film "Calamity Jane," she transformed herself into a costume knight in the American Northwest. From beginning to end, she did not reveal an inch of skin. This can be regarded as the power of the moral movement, enough to influence a bit of sexy stars.</p>
<h3>Liang Saizhen Wins Championship in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>— Lingling</p>
<p>We remember that the Liang sisters made a deep impression on people in Shanghai. The four sisters, Saizhen, Saizhu, Saishan, and Saihu, were all struggling in the dance world. Especially Saizhen, who has a very long life history, has done film work and has also been an elastic daughter. Although she is not enough to leave a fragrance, she will not stink.</p>
<p>When the flames of war broke out in Shanghai, the four Liang sisters left Shanghai and went elsewhere. In order to make a living, it is said that they are still using their beauty to support their family.</p>
<p>Recently, we received a piece of news about Liang Saizhen, which is quite valuable for leaving a fragrance.</p>
<p>It turns out that Liang Saizhen is currently a dance partner in a large dance hall in Singapore. Because the overseas Chinese have a good impression of her, her monthly rights are very considerable. Therefore, she also used this point to organize the Singapore Dance Girl Association to perform dramas and raise money for wounded soldiers and refugees in China. At the same time, she encouraged the competitive spirit of her sisters in the same industry, and specifically used the amount of donations as the standard for the championship. As a result, Liang Saizhen always won the championship of the entire association for selling the most tickets. Huang Meifang and Zhu Feiyuan ranked second and third.</p>
<p>Compatriots! They are the ones who are pointed out as living in a drunken dream, but they still do not forget the soldiers and nation of the motherland at all times. On the other hand, today's Shanghai is already old and lifeless. I wonder if after reading this article, we can also do something more meaningful in our position.</p>
<p>"Snowfield Battle" is the first film to describe the Soviet-Finnish War. The plot is very tense, and the use of the snowfield as a background is even more novel and special. The film is produced by Universal Pictures and will be premiered at the Great Shanghai Theater soon. (The picture above is one of its stills.)</p>
<h3>Female Actor Liu Qinying Re-stages at the Times Theater</h3>
<p>Female actor and Hua Dan Liu Qinying, with her beautiful appearance and extremely mellow singing voice, is especially delicate in her performance skills. Her signature plays, such as "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet," "Meilong Town," and "June Snow," are always full of seats, and have long been appreciated by those who love opera. She took a short break due to the hot weather, but now it has been decided that she will return to the stage at the Times Theater as usual today (17th). The copper picture published above is Ms. Liu's casual wear.</p>
<h3>Movie Star Tidbits Record</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>(1) Patricia and Rosemary Lane, two of the Lane sisters, have opened a small movie theater in their hometown, and their mother is in charge of all matters.</p>
<p>(2) "Oops" girl Ann Sheridan has never liked to chat with people. She has a strange habit of buying any kind of flower.</p>
<p>(3) Little Van Punk has become the father of a daughter since he announced his marriage to Mary Hart in April last year.</p>
<p>(4) Frederic March, Paulette Goddard, Bob Hope, and Dorothy Lamour recently jointly invested in a very luxurious nightclub in the film city.</p>
<p>(5) Since Louis Stone played the role of Judge Hardy in the Hardy Family films, he has often received letters of praise from fans, and most of the fans are lawyers.</p>
<p>(6) Bette Davis often uses the evening to entertain friends outside the film circle at home; therefore, it is difficult to find her shadow at Hollywood's night gatherings.</p>
<p>(7) Humphrey Bogart, a famous "villain" on the screen, is a "good guy" off the screen, which has the same artistic effect as our country's Wang Xianzai.</p>
<p>(8) Diana Barrymore recently became particularly interested in studying geography. She once said to people: "If possible, I hope to leave the film industry and take a trip around the world."</p>
<h3>Teapot Talk</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Mao Shilai and Chen Shaolin</p>
<p>Last night I met Mao Shilai at Mr. Feng's house. Shilai's one-month performance in the Golden Theater has been completed, and he will return to the north in a few days. Mr. Feng set up a banquet to send him off. Most of the guests were old acquaintances, and after the wine and food were served, the guests and hosts talked freely, mostly about opera. There were two old friends at the seat who were devoted to the Gou Huisheng school, and unanimously advocated that Shilai specialize in learning Huisheng's plays. I said: "Yes, but the Xiao Cuihua style of plays should also be learned." The two said: "Shilai's fundamental nature is not suitable for the bold and unrestrained plays of Xiao Cuihua, and learning them will definitely not be like them." I said, "You don't have to seek likeness, just seek a wider range of plays and more patterns, such as 'Roaming Dragon Playing with Phoenix' and 'Sitting in the Building Killing a Daughter-in-Law.' Shouldn't you learn from Xiao Cuihua?" Not only that, this time I listened to Shilai's voice and saw great progress. He can handle both 'Jade Hall Spring' and 'Princess Iron Mirror.' His voice is gradually coming out. When his voice comes out, he will learn more Qingyi plays in the future, to adjust the laborious nature of Wudan and Daomadan, saving effort and being clever, and his range of plays will be wider. If one person can combine the strengths of all Dan roles, then it will not be difficult to become popular in the future. Shilai agreed with my statement very much, but counting on our fingers, there are very few old actors who can teach Qingyi, whether in Peiping or inland! I secretly peeked at Shilai's appearance. His forehead is full, his eyebrows are clear, and his eyes are raised upwards, containing heroic spirit, which is why he became famous as a Wudan, and was proud in his youth. His mouth is small and his lips are red, so singing Qingyi is not hopeless. However, the area below his mouth is narrow and short, so he should cultivate more blessings and reduce the loss of energy. It is very important, very important! There was no Chen Shaolin at the seat that night. A guest asked how his artistry was. I had heard his performance of 'Scolding Cao' this time (Mao Shilai played Xin'an Station, but I didn't finish watching it, I only saw the tea house competition). I used this to answer. Shaolin was at the Renewal Theater last year. I heard his performances of 'Lotus Lantern,' 'Selling the Horse,' and 'Empty City Stratagem.' After a year, his voice is the same as before. His voice is tight, round, and has a correct flavor. He has both high and low notes. The shortcoming is that it is small. Sometimes when he puts in effort and releases it, it is also clear and audible. It is known that his small voice is originally due to insufficient middle energy, insufficient age, and lack of diligent practice. According to my prediction, in another three or five years, at most ten years, when Shaolin is nearly forty years old, his voice will definitely be wider and larger. At that time, he will also become a first-class Sheng role. If he can work hard, train his voice, and cultivate his energy, then the date of success can be advanced by several years. There are very few Laosheng talents. Shaolin, encourage yourself! (Listening to his 'Scolding Cao,' his acting is very standard, but he suffers from a small voice, and there are not many highlights, so I will not comment in detail.)</p>
