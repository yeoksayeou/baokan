<h3 id="c13">從地中海戰事說起 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>一週來，英希兩國又在東地中海方面連戰皆捷，黑衫軍一方自埃及西北邊陲退入里比亞，一方則在阿爾巴尼亞各路前錢節節敗退。英國在地中海東部一度受到威脅的地位，至此似已完全重見穩固；軸心國想在東南歡或近東方面牽掣或粉碎不列顚帝國的計劃，至此可謂業已全部失敗。凡此情勢，不但足以左右歐菲戰事，簡直連遠東時局也無形中受到許多影響。</p>
<p>英國在埃及邊境發動了反攻，三數日來，據說除克復錫迪馬拉尼鎭外。已迫令黑衫軍處索倫撤退，英軍頗有乘勝攻入里比亞的模樣；在這方面，英軍氣勢極盛，大有破竹之象。但目前不過是大戰的開始。當然還不能定什麼勝負。至於義希戰事，就現階段而論，黑衫軍確已遭遇到無可掩飾的「慘敗」。自始至終，有退無進，幾乎連招架還手的能力都沒有；這樣出人意表的「不濟」，幾乎使人懷疑義國遠征部隊是根本「不願」作戰。不是「不能」作戰；因爲號稱一等强國。居於「新秩序」領導地位的法西斯國，竟打不倒一個彈丸之地，註定了須受「領導」的二等國乃至三等國。這是不可以想像的：這幾天所傳義國國內不靖以及法西斯黨和陸軍發生磨擦的消息，毌寗倒是比較合乎邏輯的法；不過。假使眞有不靖或磨擦的事實，那就很難適合謂「全能主義國家」的條件了。</p>
<p>不論義大利對希臘用兵失敗的原因，是軍事或政治，或軍事政治兼而有之，墨索里尼威信的掃地，已是鐵一般的事實，而和他結盟的德日兩國——尤其是德國，當然也連帶受到了莫大的打擊。日本之所以不敢馬上南進，松岡之所以還要發表談話。對於三國盟約作「退堂鼓式的解釋，不妨說完全是受了義國戰敗的影響；因爲日本的南進，是以軸心國在地中海大捷，英國處境益險，美國自顧不暇爲前提的；現在的事實既和當初的預計大相逕庭。南進政策雖有欲罷不能之勢，但至少需要特別愼重一點。這是遠東時局在希臘抗戰勝利後所受到的最大後果。</p>
<p>以言德國，希特勒當初對於義國發動希臘戰事之一慕，究竟抱何態度，實在澴是一個謎。因爲：黑衫軍的奉令開入希臘邊境，是在十月二十八日淸晨六時，而希特勒之趕往義國弗洛期斯城會晤墨索里尼，却是那天午前的十一時，照常理講，似乎應該先會晤後出兵，此可疑者一；義軍既已一敗冉敗，不問以軸心關係或三國盟的的立塲來說，德國似乎都有出兵助戰的義務和需要，可是，事實呢，希特勒除了拉攏幾個不能自主的小國，做些擴大盟約的外交攻勢之外，一則向蘇土兩國保證不參加巴爾幹戰事，再則慫恿匈牙利和南斯拉夫締結友好條的，一方忙於和蘇聯談判貿易問題，一方又和土耳其簽訂漁業協定二甚至一度還有向希臘誘和的傳聞，其種種動態二似乎祗在「綏靖」巴爾幹，而不想親自向東南歐擴大戰事。又似乎祇想「明哲保身」，而不願「從井救人」，此可疑者二。</p>
<p>德國對於希臘戰事，截至目前爲止，始終維持着一種一中立一態度，這眞是一個極堪玩味的問題，其底蘊如何，將來戰事平定之後，自然會得水落石出，此際似乎不必多事推測，目前所急於欲知道的，倒是義大利對於這件不堪討好的工作，究竟將如何下台？從另一種角度來看，也可以說，希特勒在受了義國極大的「牽累」之後，究竟將如何「指導」義國去挽救當前的危局？他將聽任義國自生自滅到底嗎？這是不可能的，因爲英希兩國的陸海空三軍眼看已有席捲阿爾巴尼亞全境的可能，英國空軍一旦在亞德里亞海沿岸立足之後，義國本來不敢出動的艦隊更將變成甕中之鼈，如果外强中乾的義大利帝國，竟因德國的坐視不救，而首先敗於英國的封鎖和轟炸之下，希特勒勢必感理脣亡齒寒，而致無法繼續作戰；他將出兵助戰嗎？這事也有很多困難。派陸軍假道保加利亞或南斯拉夫罷，將有引起蘇土兩國干涉，從而觸發巴爾幹大戰的可能，派飛機到義國本部去罷，數量太少無濟於事，太多又足以牽掣對英倫的攻勢：又况德國的兵力，如果直接開到義國本土，墨索里尼領導下的羅馬帝國，將立即淪爲大德意志國的附庸，其地位將與各戰敗國無甚差別，恐怕也不是義大利民族所能接受。德國坐視既不可能，援救又未必能有「立竿見影」而不致引起枝節的有效辦法，這眞是一個極大難題：有人不禁要問軸心國會小會再來一决和平攻勢，或者另闢蹊徑，向別方面找一點可以一遮羞」的事情做做：據聞德義兩國巨頭又有的地見面的準備。如果屬實，預料對於這個問題當有一番計議。倘使二籌莫展」，那麼本來聲勢浩大的德義陣錢，恐怕快要變成一個失去均衡的「跛足軸心」了。</p>

<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念培補</p>
<p>現在社會上有很多的丈夫因為不能人道，而被妻子提出控訴而請求離婚的案件，也有許多男子自知自己的身體太不興了，而不惜購求各種喪生的事情，他們這種措施我們雖然覺得可笑可鄙！但他們這種不幸的遭，我們也實在有些代他們可憐而可悲！</p>
<p>查男子們的所以會賢虧無能，而不能盡職人道，雖然其間有很多的原因，但據著者十餘年來的臨症經驗，覺得此輩患者，竞有百分之八十以上是肇端於早歲的自凟遺精，蓋自凟是一種　傷生殖腺最劇烈的舉動，如自凟的開始尚在發育之前，這時雖無出精現象，然生殖機能往往因此摧殘，其後年齡逐年增加，而生殖器始終還是保持原狀而短小如童之感。</p>
<p>其次，如此種惡癖，在發育時或發育後方始產生，那麼性器的發育，受害雖無上述之烈，但因精關開　過頻，精囊括約筋失去控制力，於是遺精，滑精等症必相繼爆發，遂影響及於神經中樞，而有陽萎，早　，舉而不堅，性慾減退，神經衰弱等各種狀態，此種丈夫。不但在性生活上不能滿足妻子的慾望，而為妻憎惡，同時於自己的事業與觀感上，亦因精力的不濟，毫無進展與快樂之可言！</p>
<p>所以我們為防患未然與夫免蹈惡果計，患有自凟與遺精的青年，祗有從速覺醒過來，立卽提高意志，戒絕自凟，有遺精者，尤應每晚臨睡以冷水摩擦局部，服『希米脫氏固精片』以業固精關，使射精中樞不再呈過敏狀態，如因遺　過久而有陽萎，早　，發育不全，記憶薄弱，失眠盜汗，心緒煩亂等症候者，更宜兼服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以為培補，誠能及時予以挽救，那麼精强力足，幸福無窮，何至於再有此種慘劇！</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培性病專科醫師詹念曾合著</p>
<p>夫婦愛情與男子精力關係</p>
<p>一分精神，一分事業，我們也可說：一分精力，一分愛情。事業固然須要快幹，硬幹，苦幹的精神來成功。夫婦間的愛情，那更需要精力充足，聰明活潑，繼續不斷的努力來創造。因為愛情是活的，在雙方的需要中生長，在雙方情慾的協調中繁榮，如果有着充洓的精力來灌溉，細心地注意培植，那它會生長得格外茂盛。要是有精力衰弱，未老先衰等現象，那它就會逐漸的消滅而至死去！</p>
<p>我們研究愛情的來源，是完全由於性（生殖腺的作用）的刺激而生情慾的緣故，要是性能一旦失健，情慾隨之衰退，夫婦而無情與性之關係，愛情即無從產生。一個生理成熟的少女，由於肉體的不斷刺激，故頗需要異性為之配偶，此時血液充盈，內心熱烈，不時的在憧憬着如何滿足其情慾，雖或毫無性　經騐，但對地生男育女的工作她們一定很明瞭的，不過若嫁了一個性能衰弱的丈夫，那在性的關係中欲得歡樂這是微乎其微的。甚至因此而更如陷入痛苦的無底深淵！要是嫁了一個精力充足，身體健康，而絕無性病之丈夫。那立刻可把妻子引入無限歡暢之境地，她會頓然感覺結婚在人生中之可貴，因此，夫婦間的愛情彌篤，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，融融樂樂，這是人世間何等的幸福！</p>
<p>男子何為而有性病，或婚後的性能呈急遽的衰落？這據醫家的診斷，是完全由於早年的自凟遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，或用腦過度工作斷傷之礦，致生殖腺液枯竭，而暴發着早　陽萎，精力渙散，久婚不育，神經衰弱等症，是以在夫婦間性生活上即不能相互協調而兩情繾綣，甚或根本不能人道，致辜負了愛妻的年華，寃枉了自己的人生，這是多麼的有罪過！</p>

<h3 id="c48">乳峯在健美上的價值 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>高聳而有彈性的乳峯是　健美女郎必要的條件！</p>
<p>雖然說：『佛金裝，人衣裝。』但這不過是表面上的一些假面具，只是欺騙淺識無知的人的。明眼人必會注意於女性健美的實體。女性健美的實體，包括着高聳而有彈性的乳峯，發達而豐腴的臀部，白嫩而紅潤的面頰，而尤以高聳的乳峯居主要地位。因為乳峯的發達與否，可以斷定她卵巢機能（性能）的是否健全？如果卵巢機能健全，那新陳代謝作用亦必旺盛，因此不特乳峯與臀部以及其他的女性特徵都有良好的發育，同時在皮膚，肌肉，血液，內分泌腺中都充滿着新生細胞，是以皮膚自然白嫩，血色自然鮮紅，肌肉自然豐腴，因此，面頰自然就紅潤，嘴唇的顏色那更鮮　欲滴，好像一顆正熟的櫻桃，此種女郎，如果加諸快樂的笑容嫋娜的媚態，那簡直好像在春天的和風中迎人的花朶，這是多麼的光榮而幸運呀！要是患有月經不調，白帶不感以及其他的婦女暗疾卵巢機能卽受其摧殘，新陳代謝作用亦因以减退，乳部卽無良好的發育，卽已有良好的發育者，亦必逐漸的萎癟下去，面部呈樵悴枯黃或慘白現象，年齡未老，已現皺紋，此各路　女子，雖衣以錦繡，滿面脂粉，亦適足以益顯其醜陋與俗氣，為男子所畏避，丈夫所遺棄，其前途的悲慘殊不堪設法，唯一補救辦水域，據世界婦科名醫及余經驗，均一致贊許服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』，最為對症而特效。因此藥係由醫聖斯丹那氏歷三十餘年之艱辛實驗面發明，復經歐美名醫多人之化驗証明，確認其効力偉大，性質王道，服後卽能促進卵巢機能使之健全，新陳代謝作用亦因以旺盛，所以上述各症可以根本治愈，並可使乳峯聳起，面領紅潤，增進健美。</p>

<p>自上月三十日日憲兵佐佐木在滬西大西路被人狙擊後、日當局即下令將海格路大西路憶定盤路及愚園路以內之區域、完全加以封鎖、當時羣情惶急、莫可名狀、旋經本埠領事團與日方再三交涉後、封鎖之限制、始稍可寬馳、但終未能恢復原狀、直至昨日上午十一時四十分、已全部開放、一二兩路公共汽車、亦已恢復行駛、於是爲時適達兩星期之封鎖　、遂告一段落、</p>
<p>人力車照局方交涉工部局因日憲兵干涉滬西區華籍內閣及迫令人力車夫領「捐助」兩事、昨已日方提出交涉、並由工部局情報處發表公報云「查關於封鎖界外馬路區域一案、工部局總董除已致函日本總領事提起交涉外、復經函請日本總領事，對於該區司　巡捕之遭受干涉、以及行駛於局有馬路上之人力車、須請領華方執照各點、加以注意、」</p>
<p>日憲兵仍繼續搜查滬西尚有兩處、其鐵絲綱障礙物尚未移去、一在大西路與憶定盤路轉角之南段、另一在宏恩醫院與法萊柴汽車公司之間、此兩處障礙物、亦可望於一二日內移去、大西路上之汪家弄中興邨、木栅門仍繫閉、傭　兩名、在弄口監視一切憶定盤路之諸安浜一帶里弄、卽日方所認爲「恐怖份子之巢穴」者、則堵塞如故、昨日下午四時、記者經過該處時、週有日憲兵七八名及傭　若干、在該處搜查區內各商店、則均已恢復營業、</p>
<p>英商汽車昨已恢復至英商公共汽車公司方面、以滬西區障礙物旣已移去、乃於昨日上午十一時許派出一路九路各一二輛、試行愚園路、至下午則一路二路九路三綫及英商無軌電車之廿路、在大西路及愚園路上行駛如常、惟昨日僅有半數駛入、半數仍以靜安寺爲終點、今日當可恢復上月卅日以前之原狀、至十四路公共汽車、則因靜安寺路大西路交叉點封鎖錢未予開放、仍以大西路地豐路口爲終點、至所謂「滬西市民公共汽車」者、昨日已銷聲匿跡、不復發見、</p>
<p>封鎖期內損失綦重聞英商公共汽車在此封鎖期內、每日損失的在九千元以上、英商無軌電車亦受相當損失、故封銷半月兩公司損失總數在七八萬之譜、至領有租界照會之人力車則依然不能踏入越界築路區域、非取有「市照」、或在車身後貼有「滬西交通委員會特准通行」字樣、均被摒於越界築路以外、至於日商公共汽車擅自在滬西封鎖區行駛、而侵害英商公共汽車與電車公司之專利特權一事、工部局已於本星期初向日總領事提出抗議、工部局迄今尚未接得答覆、但一般預料日商公共汽車將中止在滬西區行駛、蓋因日方官員早經聲明在先、謂日商公共汽車在滬西行駛、爲「臨時辦法」也、</p>

<p>奚玉書氏主張集購</p>
<p>奚玉書會計師昨發表「米慌防止問題之檢討」略云、去年夏初、因國米來源稀少、洋米外滙步緊、米價飛漲、工部局乃作限價、在二十八年六月二十三日、曾限價計國米爲二十一元、洋米爲十七元、同年七月十七日、又限價國米爲二十元、洋米爲十六兀同年十二月九日、又限價國米爲四十元、洋米爲三十元、限價雖有、殊少遵從、比卽組織上海民食調節協會、由協會籌集基金一百萬兀、爲購存洋米調劑市面之用、認者踴躍、卽增爲二百萬元、同時各方並向協會登記集團購米、另將基金用爲購存二十萬包洋米之墊頭、惟當時有人以爲米價高漲、貧民生活堪憐、力主先辦平糶、乃移已認購米基金</p>
<p>辦理平糶</p>
<p>認集基金購備基米之動機、乃無形停頓、遷延至今、殊以爲憾、近來米荒形勢、有增無减、而社會物議、歸諸集團購米爲失策、以爲集團購米、不足以解決米荒、反而助長米荒、其理由不外認爲集團購米、足以助長囤積之風、促成米漲之潮、並處於與米店爭利之地位、此三說、固不足以詞闢正也、蓋集團購米之基本理由、一方面在於消費合作之立塲、一方面則在存儲準備米、以呑吐之辦法、判平市價之猖獗、回溯限價之初、本市米之存底、祇有十餘萬包、最少數日、存數竟進十萬包之關口、自倡行集團購米、存底遂加厚、顯有相當進步、可徵歸責集團購米、迭成囤積漲價以及與米業爭利之見解、</p>
<p>不難自釋</p>
<p>但今日縱有相黨之存底、惟居此環境、居此時間、實難信託其有不冉漲價之可能、况來茲物議、或尚有促使米價騰貴之因素者在、（一）外滙遇有變動、（二）水脚再漲、（三）產地米漲或禁出口、（四）米區靑黃不接之秋、以及其不可預料之事件等、在在均有促使米漲之危機、欲使合理解決、盍求其本、卽所以儘量疏通來源、增厚存底、則自從供給增多、米價可無需限價之禁令、自然穩平、反言之、當局縱有禁令、若市塲上無可購之米、則其效力、亦無法產生、然今日集團購米之進行、亦有</p>
<p>幾項困難</p>
<p>（一）到貨缺磅、（二）已到之貨、無到埠確期、（三）欲定最後並希望二點、（一）平糶勿中輟、（二）購辦基米、設立公倉、希望各界儘量贊助、米貼加六斗餘</p>

<p>— 高揚</p>
<p>走完了虞洽卿路的南頭，踏上敏體吊蔭路的銜接口，越過水泥「保壘」，跨進了法租界，從人頭擠擠的「大世界」面前掠過，第一幢　衝進眼簾大厦便是九層樓的靑年會。</p>
<p>在靑年會的大門口，懸上了一幅白布的橫額，上面寫着「上海兒童保育會籌募經費書畫物品義賣。」走進比馬路的地而還要低三尺大厦，推着轉門走向前，裏面是左右分開的兩座水泥樓梯。本來，這兒在平時是人衆雜亂的去處，今天，加上了義賣，自然會更熱鬧，更人多了。</p>
<p>上樓，這兒算是靑年會的二層樓，大禮堂和圖書館都在這裹。而今天的義賣品却陳列在中間的通道上。頭一攤是牙刷，遙遙相對的男女皮鞋，看標價似乎比市上現售要便宜些。裏面是熱水瓶，肥皂，信牋，兒童圖書，刺繡，玩具，毛巾等許多日用物品，一般的價格，恐怕都比市上便宜吧！</p>
<p>偶然，從桌面把視綫移到牆上去，映　眼底的是滿壁的國畫，已裱求裱的皆有，價格從五元到一二百元不等。而這裹特別刺眼的是看到了一座湘繡的玻璃屛風，一連四摺，刺上了四隻飛禽，孔雀鳳凰，錦鷄仙鶴之。的　是人工精緻，而出品　　　　　老太太」，這不免使我起了敬意，定價是國幣一千元，我想不算貴吧，允其是在那些投機市塲上，逍遙窟窿裏一擲萬千金而毫無吝色的朋友們看來，是算不了一會事的。</p>
<p>「這幅畫什麽價錢？」一個穿着筆挺西裝的闊客指着一軸沒有標價的國畫。</p>
<p>「我不知道，請等等，我去問一下好嗎？」</p>
<p>負責人來了，要價二十元，那位客人毫不在意的從大衣袋裏拿出一大刀十元的新鈔票，付了賬。</p>
<p>走上三樓，人就感到稀少了。三樓的陳設，四周都是富麗堂皇的金色鏡框和油畫。最高價說楚四白元，到現在還沒有顧主。其餘中四甬道上擺的全是古董玩器之類，大概由於陳列道些東西的緣故吧，人們的情緒似乎沒有樓下活潑了。</p>
<p>走出靑年會大厦，已經是下午四點鐘了，馬路上的　燈，正好放光，人們正熙熙攘攘地在潛動。</p>
<p>這一個多鐘點的消磨，大概不是無意義的吧，而貧苦兒童的保育事業，在中國舉辦的也還不多，這是値得提倡的，而對丐童敎育的灌輸，在今天也有着特殊的意義，但這還是「大衆」中的「小衆，」我們希望他能推到實施大衆敎育的道路上去，要是這决義賣款多的話！</p>
<p>這是社會事業，是有益於民族國家的貢獻，一方面需要社會人士的輸將，一方面盼工作人員好自爲之。（附註：今後捐款可交八仙橋靑年會轉兒童保育會）</p>

<h3 id="c82">英國的新面目 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>英國對於德軍進攻的威脅，人人都抱有絕大的決心。數星期中，英倫三島的本來面目已完全改觀，而成爲一座極大的要塞了。</p>
<p>在廣漢的沙灘上，曠野上，以至於各鄉間，縱橫羅列着深而且長的戰壕，交織成爲恐怖的防線。沿線滿佈着　關槍和散兵陣地。到處建築着障礙工事和許多砲位。</p>
<p>深配備乃是英國防禦戰略的骨幹。從海岸綫起直至內地，蜿蜒無數哩，通過無數村，一連串地都是壕溝和防舍，碉堡和瞭望崗位。道就是英國的新面目了。</p>
<p>除道外表而外，全民族戰鬥的動脈也堅强地跳動着，工人，武裝隊伍，輔助團體，無小忠心耿耿，追隨着神迪廣大的　吉爾首相，足智多謀的勞工部大臣貝文，及幹練多材的飛機製造部大臣皮佛勃魯克等人的領導，羣策羣力，向最後勝利之途邁進。</p>
<p>軍火製造的速率煞是驚人戰車製造數量已提高一倍以上，勃倫式砲車也已提高百分之六四十各種槍砲的製造數量提高百分之五十至百分之二白二十八不等，某種軍火的製造數量，竟提高四倍以上。</p>
<p>皮佛勃魯克和他屬卜的工人，在短短的三星期之內，已把某種著名的驅逐機製造數量。提高一倍以上，這幾乎使人難以置信。至於其他各式飛機的製造數量，也有極大的增加。各工廠和各兵工廠的工作，還是日夜不息地製造最精良的配備，軍械和飛機，以供軍隊應用。</p>
<p>英國訓練有素的軍隊，已在一百萬以上。年事較長的男子，也在趕速微募受訓，準備人伍的已有好幾萬。各自治領的士兵，也絡續開到，準備參加不列顚之戰。加拿大，奧大利，新西蘭開到的步兵，水手。航空人員，個個體格結實，機警善戰，堪爲干城之寄。</p>
<p>在這些隊伍的後面，至少還有地方義勇隊五十萬名，大都是退伍軍人。他們統稱爲傘兵搜索隊，包羅萬象，如倫敦附近某區義勇隊，中有大律師，在短短的兩個月時期之內，，有銀行經理，有出版家，有歡醫，有新聞記者。某隊中有宿將一員，他在上次歐戰末期，曾在法國境內帶過軍隊。其他谷隊的情形，頗多與此相仿</p>
<p>英國的第三道防線，就是內部機構的增强，三島各種資源，都已加緊開發，以應急需。還有發萬的男女，加入空防輔助隊服務，並有大批戰時後備警察，日夜守着他們的崗位</p>
<p>婦女的熱忱絕不亞於男子。有許多女子，自開汽車，工作整天，不取分文報酬。有的担任駕駛救護車，有的在兵工廠輪班工作。</p>
<p>孩童遣往各治領和美國的計劃，早已實行。自五歲至十六歲的兒童離開本國，到海外安全的友邦避難的，已有好幾萬；整裝待發的，還有好幾萬</p>
<p>陸地防務之外，還有一道海上防線。英國海軍的制海權乃是希特勒最感棘手的問題。這種制海權保持着英國的海道運輸，使數千艘商船，日夜通航，川流不息地載運大批食物，原料，槍砲，飛機，前來英國。</p>
<p>在整個地球上，分散在東西南北四方的，是不列顚帝國不盡的人力，食物，原料和工業生產力的倉庫。英國深知這决戰爭必須倚靠帝國各部份及新大陸各國的接濟，並旦知道這種信賴是不會錯誤的。</p>
<p>軍事新聞名詞詮釋</p>
<p>Torpedo魚雷，由潛水艇，或其他船艇，及魚雷飛機所放射之雪茄式自動推進爆炸彈。水雷首部最多可裝一硝基甲埨五百磅，一經震擦，卽行爆炸。內部保有空氣及油料發生內燃作用，化所儲之水爲蒸汽，使推進器得以活動。巨型之魚雷直徑達二十一英寸，其長度通常爲直徑之十二倍。在每小時三十六英里之速度內，可前進至因英里之遙。如距離較短，速率亦較高。如速率减低其行程最遠可達十英里左右。</p>
<p>Torpedo　boat魚雷　　　爲在水面放射魚雷之各式船　。最近有一種「蚊子」艇，利用其高速率駛行目標，放射魚當後，又迅速離去。其最小型者彷彿小馬達艇，可裝魚雷一枚或　枚。最高速度的四十海哩。</p>
<p>Torpedo　Plane魚雷飛機，在空中放射魚雷轟擊海上目的物之飛機。英國之Swordfish式飛機卽屬於此式</p>
<p>U．Boat德國之潛水艇。原係Unterseeboot之縮寫。利用放水入艙底及橫舵而使之下沉，甲板上裝有砲位，但主要武器則爲魚雷，在水面，或水中均可放射。最新式而最佳之潛水艇，其排水量爲一千二百噸至一千三百噸。可載船員六人。世界之最大潛水艇爲法國之“Surconf”今在英人手中，排水量爲四千三白噸，載船員一百五十人。甲板上裝八英寸口徑砲兩尊，其不漏水之倉中可藏小型海面飛機一架。沉入水中之最高速率爲十海哩。在水面時以第塞爾引擎發動機力。在水中時則利用電氣。</p>
<p>胎兒的一生</p>
<p>一滴微小蠕動的精液，衝　了一個成熱的卵子，在不覺不知之中，人類一份子的生命便開始了。就在道個授精的刹那間，不但已決定了一個新人物的存在，抑且決定了它的性別和個性。</p>
<p>卵子受精之後，隨卽爲衝卵子的精液激動起極大的活動，卒使卵子分裂，一化而　，二又化而爲四，以此類推，直至形成全身無量數的細胞</p>
<p>同時，子宮築成一座衛城胎盤，與滋胚層　力合作，去營養這生長中的胎兒、母體的血液。把食物，養氣，水分，輸送釗胎盤，再由滋胚層去　；通過臍帶的血管，輸送給胎兒。胎兒的排洩物，也排洩於胎盤，再由胎盤喻　母體的血液，帶到腎臟和肺器官，然後排洩到身體外面。外傳母體的血液，流通過胎兒，不確。</p>
<p>卵子藉芯精液　胎　，在十五天之內，胎兒是個生物，的吋之十分之一長，有頭有尾有背有腹，但是臂和腿，面和頸，還沒有；心與腦却在最簡單的形形下，具備了。</p>
<p>第一月杪，胎兒的一吋之四分之一長，較之受精時期的大五十倍，重八千倍。這胎兒從一個小小圓形卵子，，在三十大之內，變成一個有頭，有身，還有條尾巴的生物；有一個跳動着的心，也有循環着的血：臂和腿，腿和耳，胃和腦，都一齊肇始了。</p>
<p>到了第個月，胎兒可說從蝌蚪進化到人類。其長度增加六倍（約有一吋半），重量增至五白倍。骨骼與筋肉，繞着身體的輪廓，亦於皮膚與內器官間，發展着。</p>
<p>口腔分成上下顎，面積逐漸减少，因爲面頰已形成了。液囊逐漸接攏起來，直至形成一個大鼻子。眼睛起初位於頭部兩旁，現在却移繞至頭的前部了。等到第　個月最後一星期，眼臉也出現了。額角是隆起凸出的。腦佔去頭的大部分</p>
<p>四肢也有同樣的驚人發展。「肢芽」延伸着。肢端扁平，作槳狀降起，構成指根或趾根。五個平行降起物，給出現於每根間的淺槽所隔離；淺槽後來逐漸切開，於是五隻手指和足趾便彼此分家。橫的收縮，使腕，肘膝，踝，在肢內形成</p>
<p>與筋肉平行發展的便是骨骼。骨骼的發展，起初亦由半透明質軟骨形成。堅硬的骨質　　傅　於　　骨型內外層。</p>
<p>第一個月的生命，最感味的特性，或許是性器官的發展。在第二個月的初頭，若要辨認兩性的區別，很不容易。等到月終，兩性區別，從性器官的內外部，都可辦認出來，甚至兩性的乳腺，也都開頭發展了。</p>
<p>第一個月可稱爲「齒月」：因爲此時已有「齒芽」二十隻了。在硬性的牙牀骨裏面，已有齒白出現了。</p>
<p>聲帶也已出現，不過發聲仍未完備。</p>
<p>消化系開始表現着活動的徵象。襯着胃臟的細胞已開始分泌黏液。肝臟也開始灌輸胆汁於腸臟。腎臟也從事動作，分泌尿水，從胎兒的膀胱洩於羊膜液內；胎兒的糞便，仍通過胎盤，送到母親的血液。</p>
<p>由於骨骼與筋肉的發展，胎兒的狀態，輪廓，體力，都決定了。至於面部，仍在發展中的牙牀骨，頰骨，鼻樑骨，開始供給一個人樣的掄廓，又替胎兒鑄成一個瘦面龐。</p>
<p>胎兒是吾是一個活着的人體，如今不再成爲問題了。</p>
<p>胎兒從第三到第四個月，已長大到六吋至八吋，等於達到出生時的二分之一。以後的生長率便低降下去。</p>
<p>胎兒的頭，在頭兩個月，幾佔全身二分一；從第三至第五個月，佔三分一；出生時，佔四分一。</p>
<p>胎兒在第四個月，頭部稍爲挺起，脊背照理是挺直的。闊面孔；大眼睛。手足長短適度。手指和足趾相當闊，常是屈曲的。指尖和趾的膚紋。已印了蝶旋紋。</p>
<p>膚色深紅　冬縐紋。非至第六個月，胎兒的身體是缺少脂肪的。</p>
<p>這時期，胎兒在橫衝直撞，臂拔腿張了，名之曰胎動。</p>
<p>等划第五個月，汙腺洩出脂肪的泌液，使整個身體　滿一層乾酪　黏糊，阻隔着包　住胎　藏有廢物的羊膜液，不致侵蝕胎兒幼嫩的皮膚。</p>
<p>就在這個時候，整個的頭蓋都長滿了潤澤的頭髮。指甲和趾甲也出現了。正在發展中的乳齒牙一。已有琺瑯質衣包裹着。</p>
<p>這個月最使人注意的發展，就是脊椎挺直。</p>
<p>第五個月的胎兒，長的呎，重的一磅。倘流產，可能存　幾分鐘，略爲呼吸一下，或者哭幾聲，然　夭折。</p>
<p>胎兒的眼臉，在　三個月老是閉着的，一到第六個月，伸張開了。睫毛和眉毛的發展，常在第六或第七個月。</p>
<p>六個月大的胎兒，如果出生，是會呼　哭喊蠕動的，或可存活幾小時。七個月大的未熟胎兒，不是難產的話，常是可能養大的。</p>
<p>胎兒在第三個月，腦的特殊部分和機構，已經　着，等到第七個月，胎兒的神經系，便能發生作用了。</p>
<p>七月大的胎兒，長的十六吋，重的三磅。一生出來，便會哭，吃，呼吸，或許會辨別光晤。</p>
<p>這時脂肪迅速地遍佈全身，使皮膚潤滑。胎兒皮色，非常微薄，所以在出生時，極難認出屬那一種。嬰兒在出生時，眼睛多作藍灰色。</p>
<p>這時候的胎兒，不是靜止不動的；手足老是不停地騷動着。</p>
<p>胎兒有百分之十是在第二百八十天出生的，有百分之七十五，是在未到二百八十天前兩星期以內便出生了。</p>
<p>胎兒出生後，臍帶與胎盤尚未分離，須得把它切斷。</p>
<p>從授胎到出生，凡經過九個月的轉折演變。</p>

<p>— 周錫慶</p>
<p>目前上海租界內開工之麺粉廠，有福新二·七·八廠，阜豐新老兩廠，信大華豐等廠七家。依生產能力而言，上述七廠，原可每日夜出粉七萬八千餘包，但邇以原料時缺，故不能如預期之數。在民國二十七二十八兩年，內地各產麥區運麥入上海租界，尚無阻碍，故上述各廠，得繼續開工，維持本外埠民食。至今年新麥上市；來源因受「統制」，故產粉額大爲减少。粉廠方面自不得不訂購生麥。惟洋麥基價於外幣，外滙緊縮，麥價隨之昂貴，加之粉廠各項開支累增，於是麵粉價格，逐步見升至目下廠盤名義上每包十八元之多。若干粉廠因原料關係，生產减少，或停工不作，故的計每日可製透者，在九千包至一萬包。本年一月間，廠方徇工部局之提議，曾發售平價麵粉一月，（每包爲十元另加手　費三角），每日巾福新阜豐兩粉廠供給七千五百包，一時稱頌。至六月間，又發生麵粉供不應求之現象，工部局設法調劑一每包價定爲十三元八角手續費在內）幸獲解決。及至九月下旬，內地淪陷區內粉廠及滬郊諸粉廠所出產之粉，忽被禁阻運入租界，卽已到申堆存於虹口區各倉庫中之麵粉，亦不能車進租界，因此人心惶惶，咸以爲租界內各粉廠，　料有限，生產不富，本市麵粉將有告斷之勢，故一時市上買氣蓬勃。適是時洋麥報價趨昂，外滙又形緊俏，粉價於是扶搖直上。然業內外人士（允以業外）僉以爲有再漲之望，紛紛囤積不售。查上海大餅，油條，煎饅頭店攤，的有一千五百餘戶，切麵店的有四百餘戶，麵包廠的有五十餘戶，共的計二千四百餘戶，如平均每戶需粉三包，則共需七千二百包。其他尚有餅乾廠，糖果店，麵製點心店，調味品廠，紗廠以及家用等銷用數額未計在內。故粉廠每日所產粉九千餘包，供給孤島上各界消費。如無從中囤積等情，供求原可平衡。奈商人積習，利慾薰心，卽以眼前麵粉每包十八元而言，市上暗盤竟有售到二十元以外，故市塲人心，爲之震盪不定。工部局有鑒於此，於九月下旬，又出任調劑，（每包定價爲十六元八角包括手續費），凡需要麵粉者，如大餅，麵包，切麵等業，經審查合格，可往各麵粉批發商號，直接購買，蓋其間可避免麵粉零售商之從中多增費用，故粉市爲之漸入平定之境。</p>
<p>當粉市緊張之時，上海各商店行號，向澳洲定成巨額洋粉（的一百五十萬包），其價格最廉者，到申每包國幣十六元餘。目下已見陸續到申。照理粉市有貨接濟，價格可望平靜，然事實上適得其反，蓋上海租界區各華商粉廠之原料，已無豐厚積儲，據估計服刻下之生產狀况，最多可維持三數月，若干粉廠祇有月餘之小麥原料，上半年尚有內地淪陷區各粉廠之所謂雜牌粉陸續運來銷售，頗能彌補一部份之滬埠粉銷，現本廠粉產旣難持久，後步又未聞訂成大量洋麥，內地麵粉已禁止運來，（有少數經自由車自南翔經閘北一帶轉輾車來，但爲數至微），米價節節上升，麵麥銷路轉俏，故粉市不以大量洋粉定妥而見軟。最近米價大漲後。投機者鑒於米糧囤積之成本太巨，或者囤積米糧　已告盈餘，移目光於麵粉之購囤。然本廠粉籌碼極少，黑市本廠自山車牌粉每包抬至二十元零五角　廠盤十八兀），於是到申之洋粉，（的三十萬包一爲投機者之唯一目標，自十九元左右之價格，已升至二十元以上。然揆之實情，各倉庫存粉小下一百萬包，况後首有大批洋粉啣接而來，初無引起麵粉恐慌之理。特孤島游資孔多，外匯黃金紗花股票等之投機機會嫌少，乃擇大衆所一日不可或缺之米，麵，煤等民生日用主要品而操縱之，獲利之厚，如探囊取物也。</p>
<p>茲以上海存粉一百萬包及洋粉陸續到申的爲一百萬包，二百萬包　言，設上海每日共銷八千包，則可維持八個月以上，事實上，本廠尚繼續產粉，及各界預先購存之粉不在少數，所以粉市之漲，實非到銷不平衡所發生者也。管見以爲粉廠原料，爲人「統制」，除當局設法疏通內地小麥運滬外，（曾有此表示，至今未見實現），應予粉廠方面協助，分批訂購洋麥。設洋麥價貴，產粉價昻而不易銷售，宜衡情度理，加台法利潤，使粉銷不滯，得源源應市。因洋粉到申之價，有較本廠粉便宜者，則屆時之本廠粉，勢必銷路狹小，故不得不藉當局之力，以維護之。（吾人採購洋粉，反不如採購洋麥爲合算，良以洋麥製粉後之利潤，及工人得排持工作，與國人有利，如洋粉來華，國人祗　售得利耳，其他一切，悉入外人掌握中也），但筆者非反對不須訂購洋粉，事實十正不妨雙方並進，充裕上海存粉也。對於麵粉賣買各戶，除應用各業外，當時加注意，　查其用途，避免被購囤積，以利現貨流通，供求正常。</p>
<p>目下上海粉價廠盤，實爲十八元，但外間暗市每包售至二十元以上，　廠盤相差每包二元之多，因此若干平價麵粉（現在工部局主辦之平價麵粉每包十八元三角連牛續費仍在舉行辦理）之買戶，每有以十八元餘之粉，一轉手間，售出獲利每包二元，較以麪粉製成各種食品售出後之利潤或且過之，况又便利簡潔，何樂不爲。可信此種害羣之馬，不在少數。惟對於當局平衡市市價調劑民食之初衷，絕對相反，設彼此傚允，正當麪製品反而减少，使大好粉糧，囤購封存，卒至貨存於棧，市少流轉，市價蒸蒸日上，寗不可怕，故吾人以爲當局應責成經領平價麪粉之代表人，逐日調查各戶所領之粉，是吾完全用罄，有吾餘存，（當然不能恰到好處，不過求其符合足矣），如有多報領粉而自行私售者，代表人宜卽報告，如不報告而經人指摘屬實者，除該戶應領之粉卽日取銷外，並向其追索以前每日所領去之平價粉。（此項索回之粉可轉售與其他各需要戶）而代表人失職之故，亦停止共領粉一天，以儆疏忽。一方面調查全市各倉庫存粉總額，本外埠逐日銷數，每日廠方生產額，及外洋到埠之洋粉數額，歸納各方資料，適應環境情形，評定一公允粉價，以三天或一週爲期，黑市價格竭力取締之，誠能如是，震盪中之上海粉市稍得鎭靜乎。</p>

<p>— 冬生</p>
<p>小朋友，你快樂嗎？因爲一個沒有事情做的人，他很難會快樂的。大人們有句話叫做「閒愁」，人一「閒」就會「愁起來。可是，你一定不能够完全知道這兩個字的意義，請看我這多事的解釋。是嗎？當你一個人獨自在一個角落裏，一點事情也沒做，兩隻眼睛白看着兩隻手，好啦，你高興不高興？說啊！所以你千萬得有事情做。</p>
<p>然而這個世界裏有幾個人是一生出來就會有事惰做的呢？又有幾個人一生出來就能够做事情的呢？——這完全得靠大人給你的「敎育」怎麼樣？死去的「魯迅先生」不是說過嗎？施以獅虎式的敎育，他們就能用爪牙，施以牛羊式的敎育，他們到萬分危急的時候還會用一對可憐的角。「敎育」是很重要的。其實，頂頂重要的還是你自己的「學習」。「學習」是人類的「本能」，你細細地想想看，你說的話是不是從大人嘴裏「學習」來的？你用筷子吃飯是不是望見人家用纔自己會用的？这些都是「學習」做，一個人就得「學習」。</p>
<p>怎樣去「學習」呢？先要具有一種「學習的精神」。「學習的精神」是什麽呢？就是「勇氣」，「毅力」和「恒心」。因爲，你有了「勇氣」纔會不怕困難，你有了「毅力」纔會下決心去做，你有了「恒心」一纔會繼續不斷的勤勉地去做。這個樣子，你纔會「學習」到許許多多，也因此，你纔會做許多許多的事情，也纔會有許多許多的事情給你做！</p>
<p>你曾看報紙？前幾天「中美日報」上有一個消息說是沈鈞儒老先生在重慶學習俄文，一天到晚地「學習」，不管是跑路還是坐車子。你知道，沈老先生巴經是六十歲的人，你想，六十歲的人還這樣，你，小朋友，是不是應該有「學習的精神」呢？</p>
<h3 id="c93">「打菱角」 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>在秋末冬初的時候，是孩子們「打菱角」的季節。任何那一條里弄裏的孩子們，老是喜歡圍緊在一堆，在平滑的水門汀地上畫了一個圓圈，正中放着一隻「鷄」，而四周的孩子們把「菱角」打準在那隻「鷄」，嘴裏還不住的嚷着好鮮呀！」不過在那隻「鷄」上已留着一個深深的凹痕，他們口中雖嚷着「鮮」，然而並沒有吃到鷄，這原來是那些孩子們在玩着「打菱角」的遊戲，那「鷄」便是「菱角」的口頭禪。</p>
<p>阿慧劉於這「打菱角」的玩意，是因着隣家孩子們的愛好，而提起了他的興趣，費了二角錢左右買到了一隻「菱角」，向家裏要了些繩，便也加入了「打菱角」的集團。起初他的技巧不大靈，於是那隻新「菱角」不幸的被關在圈子裏，而那些技術高妙的孩子們便你一下我一下的在那隻新「菱角」上，打上了好多的痕跡，這時他的心上好似刀刺一般的難受，異常的懊喪，其他的孩子還嚷着快「白鮮鷄」！並且滿臉現出很得意的神情，似乎是眞的吃到了「鮮鷄」一般的快樂。好容易的　隣家孩子救了出來，可是他已足足被關了一刻鐘之久。原來「打菱角」的孩子們也有他們的秘密組織，三五結成「黨」；要是自己「黨」裏孩子的「菱角」打「死」了，便搶先的把它救出來，決不先救别「黨」小孩的「菱角」。「黨」的領袖是技術最高妙的孩子担任，並且年齡也較大，在一條弄裹的勢力着實不小，可算是一個小大亨。有些會拍「馬屁」的孩子，便投入他的門下，甘拜下風，因此在「打菱角」的時候，終可佔到一些便宜，不致被關「長年牢監」。耍是勢力小而沒有「黨」組織的阿慧，一加入了「打菱角」的集團中，便一直被關在圈裏休想被人救出來，自己「菱角」被人打得老遠，便只得垂頭喪氣的跑過去，把它拾到圈子裹，其他的孩子們還譏笑嚷着一這部黃包車拉得很遠了。」這隻黃狗倒很會拾肉骨頭的。一這種種譏諷的話，一句句的刺在他心上，還加着「菱角」上的凹痕，使他懊喪的程度更增加了不少。然而經過了一星期之久，阿慧對於「打菱角一的技巧倒進步得很快，而此中的黑慕也一一的明瞭，誰是他的友，誰是他的敵，他已分別得明明白白，預備想報答的報答，復仇的復仇。一</p>
<p>在一天下午，阿慧玩得正在興高彩烈的當兒，想救隣家小孩的「菱角」出來，便用力的把「菱角」打下去，那知這時恰巧有一個孩子蹲在地上拾「菱角」，因此阿慧打下去的「菱角」，和那孩子的手背上接了一個吻，然而因用力過猛，更爲了「菱角」脚的小鐵釘的緣故，那孩子手上頓時流了血，於是鬧出亂子來了。他便很快的伴着那孩子回到了他家裏，被那孩子的母親一番埋怨，而心中還卜卜地跳個不停。他眼瞧着自已「菱角」上刻着不少的傷痕，更回想到那一句句刺在心頭的譏諷話，一張張孩子們得意忘形的怪臉，和一點點沾着「菱角」脚上那孩子的鮮血，便忿恨地把那隻「菱角」拋擲到不知那裏去了；並發一個誓，下回決不幹這近乎下流的玩意！</p>

<p>— 立德小学　任德貽　一天的日記</p>
<p>七月二十五日星期四天晴淸早起身太陽已經鮮紅地照在窗上了，我知道今天天氣一定很熱，就去看一下寒暑表上的溫度，啊！已是華氏八十八度了，吃了早飯，讀了幾課英文，就熱得我滿頭大汗，休息一會，坐在窗口靜心地寫了一頁字，也會淌汗，沾濕了半件襯衫。</p>
<p>吃了午飯，更比上午熱了，再去看看寒暑表，巳經升到九十六度了。就和媽媽說：「今天天氣很熱，我要買西瓜吃。」他說今年西瓜價錢這樣貴怎能買呢？」從前在宜興的時候不要說一隻，我常是幾十隻一買的，一個夏天要吃掉幾擔呢可是現在的家鄉呢？我們的房屋呢？唉！這是受誰的苦啊你去午睡吧！這隻蘋果，等你睡醒了吃。」</p>
<p>我就拿了蘋果去睡了，不知不覺和媽媽乘車到宜興去了，走到城門口，就看見二個守城的××兵，正在打瞌睡，我們就乘了這機會。走進去了，不多時，看見自己的家庭，依然很好，並沒有燒掉，而且還藏着許多西瓜，我就揀了一隻最大的，捧在手裏，哈哈大笑說：「我現在可以盡量吃西瓜了。」一笑笑醒了，原來捧的是蘋果，不是西瓜。</p>
<h3 id="c95">一個問題 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 丹尼</p>
<p>小朋友，今天星期日，你們不上學，我來問你們一個問題好嗎？假使有隻玻璃缸，盛滿了水和冰，水面正和缸口的邊緣齊平，冰塊很大，冰浮在水上，有許多部分，伸出缸口的外面。那末天氣熱了，冰都融解成水了，水會不會溢出來？小朋友，你先想一想，且慢看下面的解說。一</p>
<p>粗心的人或者會想：水旣已把缸盛滿了，冰又有許多浮出水面，則待全部的冰融解了，缸便容納不下，水一定耍溢出的。可是事實却不然。耍明白這道理。先要曉得二件事。</p>
<p>第一：凡物熱則漲，冷則縮，惟有水有些不同。溫度漸漸的降低，水固然漸漸的縮小，可是降到攝氏四度，就縮小到最小限度，若再將溫度降低，不但不縮小，反而澎漲，直至零度，便開始凝結成冰；在凝結的時候，又大大的澎漲，所以冰的密度，比水的小。換句話說，同重量的水和冰，冰的體積比水的大，水結成冰，體積便大了許多。</p>
<p>第二：任何物體，放在流體裏，爲容易明白起見，就說放在水裹，便受到水的浮力。浮力的大小，等於被這物體所排開的水之重量。這叫阿幾米德原理，因爲是阿幾米德發見的，阿幾米德是希臘的一個大數學家。所以當物體之重量大於浮力的時候，物體便下沉，當水的浮力等於物體重量的時候，物體便浮在水上。</p>
<p>現在冰浮在水上，冰的重量就等於水的浮力；也就是說，冰的重量等於被沒入水中的冰所排開的水之重量。因爲冰的體積比水的大，所以浮出在水面之上。等它融解成水，體積縮小，恰巧塡滿剛纔被冰的沒入水中部分所佔的地位，還可以盛在缸裏，不至於溢出來。</p>

<p>公牛答道：「我連你所躱的地方也不知道，假使在你飛去的時候，我也一定不會發覺到你是巳經飛去了，所以你怎樣能把你的重量來使我疲勞呢？」</p>

<h3 id="c97">樂聖貝多芬的一生 <a href="#c97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— 苦李</p>
<p>被尊重爲西洋音樂之神的樂聖貝多芬的誕辰紀念又到了（貝氏生於一七七〇年十二月十六日卒於一八二六年三月二十六日）。往年西洋各地，都有熱烈的慶視，舉行盛大的音樂會，演奏貝氏傑作，可是在這歐戰方酣的今日，也許沒有這種舉動了。</p>
<p>貝多芬是近代第一大音樂家，値得我們敬仰和模範的，貝多芬是他的姓，名叫羅特微希（Ludwig）西曆一七七〇年十二月十六日生於德意志萊茵河岸名Bonn的一個都市裏，他的父親是一個多口舌的人，在王宮裏當職業音樂師，雖然給世人所尊敬，可是收入甚微，生活因此淸苦異常。貝多芬是他的决子，終日受他嚴厲的父親所敎誨着，所以貝多芬幼年時，全然得不到一些快樂幸福的日子，一心硏究音樂</p>
<p>貝多芬在四歲，就開始學習鋼琴，十二歲已經能代理當時有名王宮音樂師奈維的工作。十七他辭去樂師的職務，旅行到維也納，想去受敎於大音樂家莫扎爾德，不幸他母親病，，就回家去。廿二歲再至維也納，自此以後，一生就在這地方度日，受敎富地大音樂家罕頓的二年。廿四歲時，罕頓旅居英國，於是貝多芬就成世界第一流音樂家。三十歲耳漸壞，結果成爲全聾。可是貝多芬並不就此灰心，仍舊熱心用功，努力作曲，四十四歲以後，不冉出塲指揮，埋頭做作曲的工作。五十四歲時完成世界最高貴，他的最後的「第九交響樂」以後，患了胃病。五十六歲時，在殘冬患了風邪，變成肺炎，五十七歲三月二十六日傍晚，在電雷交作，暴風雨時，幽然逝世。</p>
<p>貝多芬是沒有家的，終身住在旅店裏。他的用功練習，決非凡人所及，每天練習鋼琴，總得要繼續不斷地彈上五六小時。他平時常一面散步，一面作曲，甚至在大雨中，也要散步作曲。他的傑作有：“Monn　Light　Sonata”（月光曲）“Pathetic　Sonata”（悲愴奏鳴樂）“Krculz。er　Sonata”（克洛伊讚朔拿大）“Sonata　in　F”（F調朔拿大）“Eroica　SympIsdatin　Sonata”（華爾特斯泰因朔拿大）等名曲。貝氏一生所作大交響樂共有九曲。以作出的順序而定名爲「第一第二……第九」。英雄交響樂爲第三種，故又名「第三交響樂」。</p>

<p>陳臥子是柳如是芳心愛慕的一個，以爲是風塵中的名士，頗有意將終身寄托斯人。所以這天陳臥子飛箋相招，是極難得的。他也顧不得張天如，立即前往，筵前侑酒，高歌一曲，在衆賓客前極盡周旋的能事，以博陳臥子的歡心，因此侍至酒闌席散後始歸。從陳家回到伊香巢的路途很長，其間有一段較爲冷僻的路。鎭上人睡得很早的，除了有少數富人輿馬經過外，街道上陰沉沉地冷靜得很。柳如是坐的一肩小轎，是陳臥子不放心伊夜深行路，特地接送的。轎後打着燈籠，兩個轎夫抬着柳如是忽忽地走。忽然對面來了幾個無賴，不知從那裹灌飽了黃湯而來。其中一個別號一條腿趙七的，挺起胸肚，大踏步的走路，帶着五六分醉意，口裹高哼着俚歌。柳如是的轎子來了，他們也不知避讓，轎夫不能跑路，嘴裏喚着「轎」「轎」。一條腿趙七却站着街中心不動了。轎夫只得說道：「喂，請你們讓讓路。」趙七大聲說道：「你們不好讓路的嗎？轎中坐的是什麽人？待我看一下子。」恰好前面的一個轎夫名喚快嘴阿二，性急非常，早答道：「轎裏坐的是歸家院柳氏姑娘。我們陳家送伊歸去的。你們快快讓開一邊吧。」趙七聽說是柳如是，他也早聞芳名的，便說道：「柳姑娘嗎？很好，我們這般人素聞柳姑娘的大名，只沒有緣份相見，現在要我們讓路，快請柳姑娘出轎，當面喚我三聲親哥哥，便可安然過去，吾則莫怪我們　禮。」轎夫知道這些無賴不易對付，况又酒後更是難惹，地方又是冷靜，一時無人相助，只得停住轎子。柳如是在轎子裏　聽沾楚趙七的說話，父驚又怒。伊是烈性的女子，如何受得起這種侮辱？但也知深夜冷巷，和這些無賴有什麽道理可講，所以忍住不出聲。誰料趙七走上前來，掀伊的轎門帘，對伊說道：「柳姑娘，你聽見沒有？快叫我三聲親哥哥，讓你回去。」諸無賴又鼓掌附和。柳如是滿面生嗔，說道：「你這厮好生無禮，何得黃夜攔路？快快退去，吾則明天捉將官裏去，悔之無及。」趙七哈哈大笑道：「我們預備吃官司的，柳姑娘你不耍把官來嚇人，今夜非叫不可，停轎停轎。」趙七和諸無賴大聲嚷着，喝令轎夫把轎停下。柳如是叱道：「誰敢侮辱我，有死而已！看國法容得你們嗎？轎夫快喚人來。」快嘴阿二果然喊了一聲「救救哪！。」背上早着了趙七一拳。但是背後忽然　來一條黑影，大聲喝道：「什麼事？莫非有人行刦？」（一〇）</p>

<h3 id="e1">U.S. Sends Bombers and Submarines to Enhance Far East Air and Sea Defenses; Expected to Arrive in Manila from Honolulu Today or Tomorrow; Singapore Naval Base May Be Opened for Use <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Honolulu: It was recently announced here that twelve sturdy U.S. Navy patrol bombers and a squadron of six submarines departed from here yesterday for Manila. The planes flew to Manila very smoothly and are expected to arrive simultaneously with the submarines on Sunday or Monday. According to news from Washington, the Navy Department declined to comment on the movement of bombers and submarines. Naval officials said that the movement of aircraft and submarines should be kept secret. However, well-informed sources believe that these aircraft and submarines are equipped with various spare parts. There is also a long-standing rumor that at least three British and American cruisers will sail to Singapore after January 1, 1941. It is understood that the planes sent to Manila this time are giant, multi-engine patrol bombers with 15,000 horsepower. Some reports claim that these aircraft may be handed over to the British Far East military station, but the Navy Department dismissed this as unfounded speculation. Meanwhile, the U.S. team continued to conduct "routine exercises" in the waters here yesterday. The planes departed from Honolulu on Monday, passing through Midway Island, Wake Island, and Guam. It is said that they stayed overnight in Guam on Thursday evening and then went to Manila. When the planes and submarines set off, everything was kept strictly confidential. It is generally believed that the Navy Department hopes they will arrive simultaneously without being known to the public beforehand. Although there are rumors here that the aircraft may go to Singapore, Navy officials said they had heard nothing about it. Unofficial circles believe that Singapore may be openly used by the United States within two or three weeks. They reported to the public that their statement was purely speculation.

<p>Nomura's Mission to the U.S. is Ineffective; Japanese Journalists Advocate Breaking Diplomatic Relations with the U.S.</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Chugai Commercial News commented that if the United States continues to maintain its current attitude, Japan will be forced to utilize its national power to the greatest extent. The newspaper attacked the U.S.'s Far East policy, stating that the ultimate goal of British and American aid to Chongqing is definitely not to seek the survival of China or to defeat Japan, but to sacrifice China for their own benefit. The conclusion of the Japanese-Wang treaty prompted Washington to announce a new loan to Chongqing, which simply shows America's hostility towards Japan. In view of the recent attitude of the United States, Japan feels quite pessimistic about the future adjustment of Japanese-American relations. Even if Nomura is sent to the United States, it may be ineffective. Unless the United States completely changes its Far East policy, there is little hope for improvement in Sino-Japanese relations. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: Republican Representative Mr. Claflen from Michigan told the public yesterday, "If war breaks out, the Philippine Islands will be an important component for us." Mr. Claflen requested national attention to the economic status of the Philippines. He said, "The situation in the Far East is extremely delicate, and the Philippines is right in the middle of this area. Our government has decided not only to build a comprehensive national defense on the mainland, but also to extend it to the overseas territory of the Philippines. The Philippine leaders have expressed their loyalty and cooperation to the United States in the event of an incident. If war breaks out, the Philippines will be an "important component." (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Mr. Noi, the editor-in-chief of the extremist newspaper "Teito Nichinichi Shimbun," recently published a personally signed editorial stating that unless Japan breaks off relations with the United States, the Sino-Japanese war cannot be resolved. Mr. Noi is one of the few bold and outspoken journalists in Japan. He has always been critical of Washington's attitude, which, since the outbreak of the European war, has been even more blatant than Britain's aid to China, and is indeed the enemy of Japan. I do not understand why Japan is so eager to please such countries, even sending Mr. Nomura, who is favored by them, as ambassador. Furthermore, "Japan's appeasement of the United States, or the hope of purchasing a large number of military raw materials, this policy is enough to make Japan suffer countless insults and does nothing to resolve the China issue. This will only cause Japan to be ridiculed by the Chongqing government." He said, "If I were the Minister of Foreign Affairs, or the Minister of the Navy, or the Minister of the Army, I would adopt a tough attitude, that is, we do not need to buy raw materials in the United States. I will also prohibit exports to the United States. At the same time, I will tell the Japanese people that unless we break off relations with the United States, we will not be able to resolve the China issue." The raw materials we buy from the United States can be obtained domestically through the sacrifice of the people. The Japanese government should make a firm decision on this and implement it." Mr. Noi said that Japan's signing of the Tripartite Pact with Germany and the United States was aimed at resolving the Sino-Japanese issue. He accused the government of not taking strong action against Britain and the United States, and said that Britain and the United States are the enemies of the Tripartite Pact. Mr. Noi also said, "The root cause of the expansion of the China Incident is Britain and the United States. Unless we pour cold water on it, this fire will not be extinguished."

<p>Moscow: In order to prevent the possibility of being drawn into the vortex of war, the Soviet Union has implemented continued restrictions on the supply of certain foods nationwide, reducing them by half. However, in reality, the inventories of Moscow stores are insufficient. Although the Soviet Union currently does not have a rationing system, there is a prescribed amount of goods that each person can purchase at one time. In theory, they can purchase the same amount of goods at other stores, but because the number of people purchasing is extremely crowded, it is necessary to stand in a very long line, which takes a long time, so very few people implement this trick.

<p>On the Tuscaloosa: President Roosevelt spoke with the Duke of Windsor for two hours yesterday, discussing the issue of the United States leasing military bases in the Bahamas. Then the President boarded the ship and his escort ships and set sail back to the United States. The President's trip covered 3,000 miles and inspected four of the eight newly acquired bases. The President told people that the Duke of Windsor discussed with him the selection of a better base address in detail. Windsor may visit the United States in the future to study the U.S. relief for the unemployed and the Civil Conservation Corps as a model for relieving unemployment in the Bahamas. (United Press, 14th)</p>
<p>Miami: President Roosevelt and the Duke of Windsor had an unexpected meeting yesterday in the territorial waters of the British Bahamas, discussing issues for nearly three hours, ranging from the European war and the international situation to the Western Hemisphere defenses in the Caribbean, to the President's bravery as a fisherman. The Duke left the dramatic meeting and boarded the cruiser Tuscaloosa, with a cordial attitude and a bright spirit. Seven and a half hours later, he took off on a U.S. giant bomber. The Duke told reporters, "I have just returned from paying my respects to President Roosevelt in my capacity as Governor of the Bahamas." The Duke stressed that this meeting had been arranged before the death of the late British Ambassador to the United States, Lord Lothian, but observers here generally believe that the meeting between the Duke of Windsor and President Roosevelt is very important, as the Duke's name has been included in the list of successors to Lord Lothian's position.

<p>U.S. is Discussing Aid to Britain</p>
<p>Washington: According to announcements from responsible sources here, those who advocate more aid to Britain have drafted two proposals for maritime aid to Britain and will urge President Roosevelt's attention next week. The two proposals are: (1) U.S. ships escort U.S. ships to transport supplies to Britain; (2) Sell part or all of the 143 foreign cargo ships moored in various U.S. ports to Britain. It is said that this proposal is only in the discussion stage and will require congressional approval. The plan to sell or exchange the remaining 75 overage U.S. destroyers to Britain is still under discussion. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>New York Aerial News: The "American Emergency Relief Committee for China" has recently been established, with Mrs. President Roosevelt serving as honorary president. Many celebrities from all walks of life have supported the committee, including former U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See Taylor, Times Weekly editor Ross, Colonel Roosevelt, son of the late President Roosevelt, Mrs. Morgenthau, the current Secretary of the Treasury, and famous female writer Pearl S. Buck. The committee is cooperating with the American Medical Aid to China, and Ms. Pearl Buck has launched a fundraising campaign directly to the country in order to raise one million U.S. dollars to purchase medicines and aid China, with the goal of reaching the goal before January 1 next year. Ms. Buck made a statement at the beginning of the fundraising, calling on all sectors to donate generously, saying, "We have already expressed our deep sympathy for the British who are fighting heroically in Europe, but we cannot ignore the Chinese nation who are fighting for freedom in the Far East and are showing the same courageous spirit under bombing. The Chinese nation is continuing the war of resistance in silence and with unwavering determination, but because of famine and epidemics, millions of people are dying. It is time for us to provide relief." At the same time, famous Chinese writer Lin Yutang and famous movie star Lu Slanah (known for playing the female role in Pearl Buck's "The Good Earth") both gave radio speeches, urging all sectors to donate generously. In addition, Ms. Pearl Buck also received a telegram from Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek of China, Soong Mei-ling, which stated that during the previous period when the Yunnan-Burma Highway was closed, there was a lack of medicine in the rear of China. Major surgery was often performed without anesthesia, and the suffering of the patients can be imagined.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e13">Starting with the Mediterranean War <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Over the past week, Britain and Greece have repeatedly won victories in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Blackshirt forces have retreated from the northwestern border of Egypt into Libya, while on the Albanian front, various advance units are retreating steadily. Britain's position in the eastern Mediterranean, which was once threatened, now seems to have been completely stabilized. The Axis powers' plans to contain or crush the British Empire in Southeast Asia or the Near East can be said to have completely failed. All of these situations not only affect the European and African wars but also indirectly affect the Far East situation in many ways.</p>
<p>Britain launched a counterattack on the Egyptian border. In the past few days, in addition to reclaiming the town of Sidi Barrani, it is said that it has forced the Blackshirt forces to retreat to Sollum. The British army seems to be in a strong position to attack Libya in one fell swoop. In this regard, the British army is very powerful, with the momentum of splitting bamboo. But at present, it is only the beginning of the war. Of course, it is still impossible to determine the outcome. As for the Italian-Greek war, at this stage, the Blackshirt forces have indeed encountered an undisguised "惨敗" (miserable defeat). From beginning to end, there was only retreat and no advance. They almost did not even have the ability to parry. This unexpected "incompetence" almost made people suspect that the Italian expeditionary force simply "did not want" to fight, not "could not" fight. Because a self-proclaimed first-class power, occupying the leading position of the "new order," cannot defeat a small territory, which is destined to be "led" by second- or even third-rate countries. This is unimaginable. The news of domestic unrest in Italy and friction between the Fascist Party and the army that has been circulating these days is more logical. However, if there is indeed unrest or friction, it will be difficult to meet the conditions of a so-called "totalitarian state."</p>
<p>Regardless of the reasons for Italy's failure to use force against Greece, whether military or political, or both, Mussolini's prestige has been swept away like iron, and the two countries allied with him, Germany and Japan—especially Germany, have certainly suffered a tremendous blow as a result. Japan does not dare to immediately advance south, and Matsuoka still has to make a speech. His "retreating explanation" of the Tripartite Pact can be said to be entirely influenced by Italy's defeat. Because Japan's southward advance is based on the premise that the Axis powers win a great victory in the Mediterranean, the British situation is more dangerous, and the United States cannot take care of itself. Now that the facts are very different from the original expectations, the southward policy has a momentum of wanting to stop but not being able to stop, but at least it needs to be especially cautious. This is the biggest consequence that the Far East situation has suffered after the Greek victory in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>As for Germany, what attitude did Hitler originally hold towards Italy's launching of the Greek war is still a mystery. Because: The Blackshirt forces were ordered to enter the Greek border at 6:00 a.m. on October 28, while Hitler rushed to Florence, Italy, to meet with Mussolini at 11:00 a.m. that morning. According to common sense, it seems that he should have met before sending troops, this is suspicious point one. Since the Italian army has been repeatedly defeated, regardless of the Axis relationship or the standpoint of the Tripartite Pact, Germany seems to have the obligation and need to send troops to help. However, in fact, in addition to wooing a few small countries that cannot be autonomous and doing some diplomatic offensives to expand the alliance, Hitler guaranteed to the Soviet Union and Turkey that he would not participate in the Balkan war, and then encouraged Hungary and Yugoslavia to conclude a friendship treaty. He was busy negotiating trade issues with the Soviet Union, and then signed a fishery agreement with Turkey. There were even rumors of trying to induce peace with Greece. All kinds of trends seem to be only in "appeasing" the Balkans, and do not want to personally expand the war to Southeast Europe. It seems that he only wants to "protect himself wisely" and does not want to "save people from a well," this is suspicious point two.</p>
<p>Germany has maintained a neutral attitude towards the Greek war to this day. This is a very intriguing issue. What is the bottom line will naturally come to light after the war is settled in the future. At this moment, there seems to be no need to speculate too much. What we are eager to know is how Italy will end this unrewarding work? From another perspective, it can also be said, after Hitler has suffered a great "involvement" from Italy, how will he "guide" Italy to save the current crisis? Will he let Italy sink or swim to the end? This is impossible, because the British and Greek armies, navies, and air forces seem to have the possibility of sweeping the entire territory of Albania. Once the British air force gains a foothold on the Adriatic coast, the Italian fleet, which originally did not dare to move, will become a turtle in a jar. If the Italian Empire, which is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, is defeated by the British blockade and bombing because Germany sits idly by, Hitler will inevitably feel the cold of his lips and teeth and will not be able to continue the war. Will he send troops to help? There are also many difficulties in this matter. Sending the army through Bulgaria or Yugoslavia will cause intervention from the Soviet Union and Turkey, thereby triggering a Balkan war. Sending planes to mainland Italy would not be helpful if the number is too small, and too many would be enough to contain the offensive against Britain. Moreover, if Germany's troops directly opened to mainland Italy, the Roman Empire under Mussolini's leadership would immediately fall to the vassal of Great Germany, and its position would not be much different from that of the defeated countries, which may not be acceptable to the Italian nation. It is impossible for Germany to sit idly by, and there is no effective way to provide aid that can have an immediate effect without causing complications. This is a very big problem. Some people cannot help but ask whether the Axis powers will come to a final peace offensive, or find another way to find something that can "cover up their shame." It is heard that the two giants of Germany and Italy are preparing to meet again. If it is true, it is expected that there will be a discussion on this issue. If the two are at a loss, then the originally powerful German-Italian camp may soon become an unbalanced "lame axis."</p>

<h3 id="e20">British Loan to China: British Press Comments <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>London: The London "Gu's Paper" gave a positive assessment of the British loan of ten million pounds to China, stating that its main significance was that Britain and the United States were adopting a parallel policy in the Far East.</p>
<p>"The Times" Editorial</p>
<p>British self-governing dominions and the United States both welcome the US loan to China. The extent to which Britain supports China is less than the extent to which the United States supports China. However, a loan of ten million pounds is sufficient to assist the Chinese government in purchasing physical materials abroad and stabilizing foreign exchange rates. The loan is a sign of Britain's friendship towards China. Since the withdrawal of some Japanese troops from southern China, the situation of the Chinese government has improved. The loans from Britain and the United States will further enhance its position. If Japanese troops withdraw from the Yangtze River basin, then the (Nanjing Organization) will not be able to survive. Britain's loan to China will undoubtedly cause dissatisfaction in Japan. However, we should know that the blame lies with Japan. The Japanese side still remembers when Britain closed the Burma Road and concluded an unpopular agreement with the Japanese government. The British government hoped that China and Japan would reach an understanding during the closure of the road, but Japan signed a treaty with the (Nanjing Government), mistreating Britain and the United States. They concluded the Tripartite Pact and incited Japanese extremists to insult and slander the British in return for Britain's goodwill. Now that Foreign Minister Matsuoka has formally declared the Tripartite Pact as the cornerstone of Japanese foreign policy, Japan cannot expect Britain to act according to Japan's wishes.</p>
<p>The "Financial News" stated that people from all walks of life were pleased to learn of the British loan to China. London banking circles stated that this was a sign that Central America's cooperation and Japan's intimidation of British and American interests in the Far East had failed. As for the new stabilization fund, it will not affect the external price of the Chinese Yuan. The price of the Chinese Yuan will remain at its current level and will not increase further, because increasing it would cause China to increase imports of unnecessary goods and reduce China's exports.</p>
<p>The "Manchester Guardian" believes that Britain's loan to China, coming after the US loan, is a strong statement, in contrast to the weak attitude of closing the Burma Road. In the past, British and American actions in the Far East often failed to be consistent, but today a parallel policy has been completed. This is of great importance to the relationship between Britain and the United States, and to China. In nine days, the splendid Tripartite Pact boasted by Berlin has achieved the opposite result. Its threat only proves the sincerity of Britain and the United States in adhering to the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan has always regarded any conciliatory action by Britain as a sign of weakness, but they now recognize that Britain's policy of appeasement has ended, and China's indomitable perseverance has been rewarded.</p>
<p>The "Daily Telegraph" reported from Tokyo that the British loan was an innocuous act. Japanese newspapers and people from all walks of life have taken a consistent attitude and attacked it wantonly. But it is doubtful whether this action by Britain will receive any retaliatory action other than newspaper editorials criticizing it. Japan's actions in the Pacific are now extremely cautious and are doing their best to ease the concerns of democratic countries. In addition, the fate of the Japanese cabinet has begun to waver. The increase in the 1941 budget has made the Japanese people uneasy, because the shortfall can only be remedied by issuing public bonds. (Fourteenth Dispatch)</p>

<p>Hanoi: Well-informed French sources recently stated that since France issued a warning, stating that if Thailand bombed Vietnam, it would retaliate and bomb Bangkok, Thai troops have ceased their attacks on Vietnam for two days. As the situation on the border has become relatively calm, Vietnamese Governor Decoux is scheduled to leave here for Saigon on December 16th. News of new negotiations regarding the resolution of border disputes between Thailand and Vietnam is in progress. French officials neither deny nor confirm this, but state that based on the recent attitude of Thai radio and the fact that no Thai aircraft have bombed construction sites for two days, the transmission of this message does not seem to be without reason. Thai radio stated this week that Thailand is willing to engage in negotiations. Furthermore, local newspapers have recently expressed opinions opposing Thailand's territorial demands, stating that most of the territory north of Cambodia was previously part of the Khmer Kingdom, inhabited entirely by Cambodians. They also stated that the Se Mou River, more than one hundred kilometers north of the border, is a more suitable natural boundary. (Fourteenth United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Bangkok: The Thai Supreme Command announced last night that on Thursday, over one hundred French soldiers attempted to invade Ubon (transliteration) on the border. After more than half an hour of fierce fighting, the French soldiers were repelled. This conflict occurred at 10:30 a.m. The communique did not mention casualties, but stated that French troops also fired at outposts in other parts of the Thai border.

<p>Bangkok: Just as Hannibal, the Carthaginian general in the First Punic War in ancient history, rode elephants across the Alps, the French seem to be imitating this ancient hero. According to the Thai Supreme Command yesterday, French guerrillas recently invaded Thailand on elephants. The communique stated that twenty-four French guerrillas, two of whom rode elephants, three rode horses, and one rode a bicycle, invaded Sangkhlaburi to search for food. After engaging in combat with Thai troops, they were repelled by the Thai troops. These elephants, horses, and bicycle are said to be the French guerrillas' "mechanized equipment."

<p>Saigon: Vietnamese government officials recently told United Press reporters that the unrest in southern Vietnam has been quelled through the arrest of thousands of people and the implementation of high pressure. French officials have been able to completely control the situation in the area. If French officials had not known in advance that native communists were attempting to attack French troops and smuggle weapons to Saigon, serious consequences would have occurred. The French authorities have now detained the main rebel leaders. In addition to continuing to carry out arrests every day, they are planning to completely eliminate communist elements. The French authorities also pointed out that the arrest of communists began when the European war broke out. However, large-scale action against native communists was taken after the unrest occurred. The authorities also stated that because the communists were protected by the French Popular Front in the past, they had experienced various difficulties in dealing with them. They also stated that some native communists were hiding in the marshes outside Saigon, making it difficult for the French to bomb these areas. Telegraph communications have been completely restored today after the rebels cut the wires on November 28th. (Fourteenth United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Saigon: At dusk today, Savannakhet, a French military outpost in the Laotian region, was bombed by Thai aircraft and shelled by Thai troops. (Fourteenth United Press Dispatch)</p>

Governor Decoux of Vietnam told Japanese journalists that the Vietnamese government is determined to deal with the situation, stating that if the Thai side continues its military aggression, the Vietnamese side is prepared to counterattack. The Vietnamese side still hopes for a peaceful resolution, but if the situation develops into war, the responsibility must be borne by Thailand. (Tenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Since the US and British governments announced loans to China, the general public has been paying attention to the military supplies that China will purchase from the two countries in accordance with the agreements. According to Chinese authorities, the weapons most needed today are aircraft, so it is well known that they have recently sought to purchase these from the United States. Chinese leaders, newspapers, and the public are now strongly advocating that Britain and the United States increase the number of aircraft sold to China. It is said that after a large batch of aircraft arrives from overseas, China will be able to implement four actions. The first is to protect the Yunnan-Burma Road from Japanese air attacks, so that foreign goods can be imported and Chinese goods can be exported continuously, and to protect major cities such as Chongqing, Kunming, and Chengdu from Japanese air raids. With a large fleet of aircraft, China will be able to attack major cities currently occupied by the Japanese army, such as Hankou, Jiujiang, and Guangzhou. Furthermore, if there are enough aircraft to distribute, it will greatly assist the Chinese army in its counter-offensive. (Tenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Cairo: Bardia, an important coastal base in Libya, and Tobruk were bombed by the British Air Force last night. Several buildings became fiery ruins. The offensive army has driven tens of thousands of Italian troops invading Egypt out of Egypt, and there is a trend to counter-attack into Libya. The British Air Force's bombing of the above two places is almost a prelude to the counter-attack on Libya. According to the communique issued here, in addition to the 20,000 Italian troops who had already been taken prisoner, there were also tens of thousands of regiments, all of whose officers and soldiers were captured by the blitzkrieg British army. At the same time, the powerful British Air Force spread its wings and flew far into Libyan airspace, bombing its main ports and nerve centers, including at least twelve airfields. British official sources said that British warships used 13-inch shells to snipe at the retreating Italian troops and Italian bases. The British Air Force used this as cover to send flames thousands of feet into the sky over Bardia, and dropped "multi-ton" bombs on Tobruk. At the same time, it was heard that British mechanized forces were advancing on Sollum, the last major Italian base in Egypt. It is said that Sollum had already caught fire. (Fourteenth International News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: A communique from the British Air Force Headquarters in the Middle East stated that last night and yesterday, British Air Force bombers and fighters continuously intercepted enemy airfields, troops, and motor transport vehicles in Libya. Last night, British aircraft launched a particularly fierce attack on Tobruk, dropping tons of bombs on the city and port. Many fires were seen to be burning fiercely. When the British aircraft returned, fires were seen near the gasoline depot in Sollum Bay, and explosions also occurred near the electrical depot. British aircraft reconnoitered the El Adem airfield near Tobruk, strafing enemy aircraft on the field and seeing a hangar bombed and completely destroyed. British aircraft also flew to Bardia for a heavy bombing, hitting a storage depot with bombs, causing a roaring explosion and flames rising thousands of feet. Enemy aircraft on the ground were also strafed, and three were destroyed. Italian aircraft were also destroyed in El Imi. More than ten enemy airfields and landing grounds attacked by British aircraft were severely damaged. In addition, British fighter planes patrolled all day, covering the British army's pursuit and harassing the retreating enemy troops, destroying many enemy mechanized equipment. Enemy troops on the transportation lines were also attacked, and their morale was declining. The Australian Air Force also mobilized and continued to win victories, shooting down three enemy aircraft. One British eight-gun fighter plane attacked two Italian bombers escorted by fighter planes alone, shooting down one on the spot and injuring the other. (Fourteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Cairo: Well-informed sources said yesterday that although the British army had been fighting fiercely in the western desert area for five days, their casualties were unusually light. According to British wounded soldiers who returned here, the Italians and Libyans had no fighting spirit at all. As a result, the British army was able to capture a large number of prisoners. It was also said that all the food and gasoline that the Italian army had stockpiled for the invasion of Egypt were now being used by the British army. These British troops are now pursuing the remaining troops of the Italian 5th Division from northwestern Egypt towards Tobruk. The advanced units of the British army are now putting great pressure on the collapsing Italian army. Other British troops are carrying out mopping-up operations in this vast battlefield of four or five million miles. Aviators of British Hurricane aircraft attacked the rear of the Italian army 67 times in three days. According to them, Sollum, the extreme northwest of Egypt, was bombed by British aircraft and caught fire, and a long British motorized unit had stepped up its advance on Tobruk. Furthermore, on Thursday evening and yesterday morning, British Air Force fighter planes launched a terrible attack on the Libyan ports occupied by the Italian army.

The collapse of the Italian army will not only have a profound impact on the situation in the Middle East and the military situation elsewhere, but will also affect the future of civilization throughout the world. This battle may greatly shorten the war, but everyone must resolutely fulfill their responsibilities in order to win victory.

<p>Morale of Blackshirt Army Declining, British Warships Threaten Coastline</p>
<p>West Desert Port: In recent days, exhausted Italian prisoners have been passing through this small port in British warships. This situation can be regarded as the conclusion of the recent British army's lightning war on land, sea, and air. When the British warships were bombarding the Italian army with heavy artillery, the radio of this ship received a telegram from a British tank on land: "My car has stopped in front of more than two hundred people holding up their hands. I have captured these infantrymen." The British navy's bombardment of Sidi Barrani and the British Air Force's bombing of various airfields in Libya have undoubtedly threatened the Italian army. (Fourteenth United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Reuters has learned from the naval circles in London that the British Navy's shelling of the Italian army in the West Desert was extremely fierce, and the attacking fleet suffered no casualties. In addition to undertaking the important task of assisting the army and air force, the British fleet is also constantly monitoring the Italian maritime transportation lines, so it is becoming increasingly difficult for the Italian side to transport supplies to Libya. According to British naval circles, the rapid movement of the Greek army is also largely due to the assistance of the British Navy. This has not yet been known to the general public. Reuters' special correspondent on a British warship observing the British fleet's shelling of coastal battles near the Libyan border cabled that the British warship he was on was currently anchored outside a certain port in the western desert of Egypt. In the past few days, ragged prisoners have been continuously escorted to the port, causing major food and transportation problems. A large number of prisoners need to be transported elsewhere by rail and road in order to accommodate the prisoners who continue to arrive. The British coalition forces are now quite successful in driving out the Italian army. (Fourteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Three Italian Divisions Destroyed in the Battle of Sidi Barrani</p>
<p>London: Reuters' military commentator said that British Prime Minister Churchill described the Battle of Sidi Barrani as a first-class victory. This statement is not an exaggeration, whether from the impact on Libya's future status and the overall future of the war, or from the level of British military effectiveness. The enemy will definitely hesitate and think about their advantage in land warfare, whether we are only based on the number of people. The British have now destroyed three Italian divisions as a result of a resolute and rapid implementation of superior strategy. Italian General Graziani may still have ten divisions, but perhaps less than ten divisions, because the soldiers needed for transportation and administration are also included. If the recent battle can be regarded as the standard, then the lack of military training and efficiency on the Italian side can also be known. The extent of the Italian failure cannot yet be estimated. Will the entire Italian army collapse, or will General Graziani be able to reorganize a new army, hold a new position, and decide the outcome again? It is unknown. At the same time, the British army may not be able to continue its offensive immediately, because food, water, gasoline, and various repair materials must be transported to the front for application. The difficulty facing British commander Wavell is to send sufficient troops through Sollum to support the vanguard of the British army, so as to proceed with its great strategy. As for the supply problem, it may not be an obstacle to the British army's advance, because the British control the sea power and can use all the good ports along the coast. General Wavell can rely on the assistance of the navy on his right side, so the general situation is quite favorable to the British side. (Fourteenth Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Today, military experts here believe that Sollum, the main base of Italian North African Army Commander General Graziani, the general distribution point for all Italian army food and military supplies for the past three months, may become a death trap for the Italian army. There is only one extremely long and narrow road from Sollum to Bardia, and the Libyan coast and the western border of Egypt are connected by two narrow roads. The British army will be able to annihilate the retreating Italian army on these narrow roads in the future. (Fourteenth United Press)</p>

Since Fascist chief spokesman Farinacci fiercely attacked General Badoglio, Italian newspapers have begun to demand a major purge of "domestic enemies." The Fascist "Tavero" newspaper stated, "In this war, the Italian middle class has once again revealed its hateful face and become an enemy of the motherland. Since they are enemies of the motherland, they should be treated as they should be treated. Do not hesitate, do not pity, and purge them." The "Roman People's Daily" said, "The time has come for the Fascist Party to purge domestic rebels, defeatists, and those who are derelict in their duties. It must be carried out without mercy."

<h3 id="e34">British Air Force General Details Situation in Egyptian Theater, Imperial Troops Spiritually Elevated, Rapid Progress Like Splitting Bamboo <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>London - A Reuters military correspondent reports from the Western Desert of Egypt that a senior British Air Force general, who shot down over sixty German aircraft during the previous major battle, told reporters today that, by God's grace, the current Egyptian campaign has decisively defeated the Italian army. All British Imperial troops participating in this battle are spiritually uplifted, advancing and attacking like splitting bamboo, their progress unexpectedly rapid because the three services had extremely careful plans in advance and all operations proceeded extremely smoothly. The food and oil supplies that the Italian side had prepared for the invasion of Egypt were all captured by the British army, which is extremely useful for the advancing British troops. As for the total number of Italian casualties and the total amount of materials captured by the British army, it will not be possible to check clearly until several days later. The reporter traveled in a truck with the army in the desert for two days and only saw a batch of Italian aircraft dropping bombs on the camp. Apart from that, there was no further aerial activity by the Italian side. However, during these two days, British bombers and fighters soared in the air day and night, with the roar of engines constantly bombing Italian airfields and covering the advancing British army, hardly stopping their activities except to return to base for ammunition. An officer said that the British army's victory was a Christmas gift to the people at home. The Imperial troops participating in this attack, including the British, Scottish, and Indian troops, fought bravely and used ingenious tactics, enabling them to force the Italian army of five divisions, including the Blackshirts, out of their strong defensive positions in less than a week. Italian General Maletti, who died in the battle of Nibeiwa, had his chief of staff, Colonel Costellazzo, captured. The colonel highly praised the British army's operations. It is reported that the British army planned this battle well and carried it out meticulously, catching the Italian army by surprise. Colonel Costellazzo recounted the start of the battle of Nibeiwa on Monday morning, saying that the British army opened fire near dawn, and the Italian generals sent troops to patrol in front of the forts. Before long, they heard that British tanks had already rushed from [omitted]. The speed of the advance was such. After the British army captured Nibeiwa, it immediately prepared to attack north. The Damarcos fort between Nibeiwa and Sidi Barrani was captured that night, enabling them to concentrate and advance on Sidi Barrani. They arrived at Safarli, ten miles west of Nibeiwa, and did not immediately attack the important Italian barracks there, but only dispatched armored vehicles to contain them. The main force of the British army bypassed this place and advanced towards Sidi Barrani and Buq Buq. By the morning of Wednesday, the Italian army guarding Safarli decided to abandon it. Hundreds of motor vehicles and thousands of Italian soldiers, including part of the 63rd Division and some Blackshirts, retreated hastily towards Sallum all day, constantly harassed by British bombers and fighters. Before the fall of Sidi Barrani, the British army first attacked Maktila, twelve miles east along the coast of the area, which was heavily bombarded by the British navy. Most of the Libyan soldiers fled for their lives, leaving only the Italian garrison and some Italian officers to resist stubbornly, eventually failing to hold the position. The escaping troops were intercepted by the British army, who annihilated part of them. The rest fled to Sidi Barrani, which was defended by an elite Italian Blackshirt division and had been building sophisticated defenses for several months. Before long, the British navy and air force heavily bombarded Sidi Barrani, while the British army launched attacks from the east, southeast, and south. Another British force attacked the coastal area of Buq Buq, ten miles west, cutting off the Blackshirt's retreat along the coast. At that time, a westerly wind roared, sand and stones flew, hitting the faces of the British infantry. However, the British army braved these difficulties and fierce artillery fire to advance bravely. By noon on Wednesday, the Italian troops in Sidi Barrani had been completely cleared. The last to fall were some strong [omitted] points of the enemy around the city. This battle was not without quite interesting events, such as when Italian troops surrendered in one place, the British army found an Italian colonel inside who had already packed his pajamas and other items in a bag, waiting for the British army to come and detain him. The colonel was subsequently taken to a special officer detention camp in the desert, where Colonel Costellazzo, General Bastico, commander of the 2nd Libyan Division, and the son of General Maletti were already detained.

<p>Athens - A captured former Italian commander told a United Press reporter that the Italian military headquarters in Alghinetlana is currently debating whether to heed the Greek army's request for a ceasefire. There are two factions within the Italian command there, one advocating for peace, the other advocating for further withdrawal into the interior of Albania. The former believes that seeking peace can be used as a delaying tactic, allowing Italy a significant amount of time to re-prepare. The latter believes that the farther they withdraw, the longer the Greek lines of communication will become, and that the adverse weather conditions can stop the Greek advance.

However, while London was fortunate to escape the devastation of German aircraft, Sheffield suffered a fierce bombing raid on Thursday night. On Friday morning, residents of Sheffield emerged from their air raid shelters to find that the city's tall buildings had been transformed into a vast landscape of broken theaters, shops, and other buildings. All the streets were piled with rubble. Many residents of the damaged buildings have begun evacuating because of the risk of the buildings collapsing at any time. It is believed that many people are still buried under the rubble. (United Press dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Common Disease of Youth</p>
<h3 id="e46">Impotence and Weakness Due to Masturbation and Nocturnal Emission Affecting Marital Life! <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>---Supplement by Venereal Disease Specialist Doctor Zhan Nianpei</p>
<p>There are now many cases in society where husbands are sued by their wives for divorce because they are unable to perform sexually. There are also many men who, knowing that their bodies are too weak, do not hesitate to seek various ways of ending their lives. While we may find these actions laughable and despicable, we also feel sorry and sad for their unfortunate plight!</p>
<p>The reasons why men become impotent and unable to fulfill their sexual duties are varied. However, based on my clinical experience of over ten years, I believe that over 80% of these patients have their origin in early-age masturbation and nocturnal emission. Masturbation is an act that severely damages the reproductive glands. If masturbation begins before puberty, although there is no ejaculation at this time, reproductive function is often damaged as a result. As age increases, the genitals remain in their original state and feel as small as a child's.</p>
<p>Secondly, if this bad habit develops during or after puberty, then the development of the sexual organs may not be as severely affected as described above. However, because the seminal gate is opened and [omitted] too frequently, the sphincter muscles of the seminal vesicles lose their control, and symptoms such as nocturnal emission and spermatorrhea will inevitably erupt successively. This affects the central nervous system, leading to various conditions such as impotence, premature [omitted], failure to achieve an erection, decreased libido, and neurasthenia. Not only can such husbands not satisfy their wives' desires in their sex life, leading to resentment, but their own careers and prospects are also hindered by a lack of energy, with no progress or joy to speak of!</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to prevent such problems from happening and to avoid the consequences, young people suffering from masturbation and nocturnal emission must wake up as soon as possible and immediately strengthen their willpower to quit masturbation. Those suffering from nocturnal emission should especially rub their genitals with cold water every night before going to bed and take "Hemet's Semen-Conserving Pills" to strengthen the seminal gate and prevent the ejaculation center from becoming oversensitive. If impotence, premature [omitted], incomplete development, poor memory, insomnia, night sweats, or anxiety have resulted from prolonged seminal [omitted], it is even more advisable to take the gonadal hormone preparation "Gonadotrophic Hormone" as a tonic. If these measures can be taken in time to reverse the situation, then strength and energy will be restored, and happiness will be endless. Why should such tragedies occur again!</p>
<h3 id="e47">Husband and Wife Knowledge <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Co-authored by Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor and Venereal Disease Specialist, and Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>The Relationship Between Husband and Wife Love and Male Energy</p>
<p>One point of spirit, one point of career, we can also say: one point of energy, one point of love. A career certainly requires a spirit of quick, hard, and arduous work to succeed. The love between husband and wife requires even more abundant energy, intelligence, liveliness, and continuous effort to create. Because love is alive, it grows in the needs of both parties, and flourishes in the harmony of both parties' desires. If it is irrigated with abundant energy and carefully cultivated, it will grow exceptionally lush. If there are phenomena such as weakened energy and premature aging, it will gradually disappear and even die!</p>
<p>We study the source of love, which is entirely due to the stimulation of sex (the function of the reproductive glands) that produces desire. If sexual function is once impaired, desire will decline accordingly, and if there is no relationship between affection and sex in a husband and wife, love cannot be produced. A physiologically mature young woman, due to the constant stimulation of her body, greatly needs a partner of the opposite sex. At this time, her blood is full, her heart is fervent, and she is constantly dreaming of how to satisfy her desires. Even if she has no sexual experience, she will certainly be very clear about the work of giving birth to children. However, if she marries a husband with weakened sexual function, it is very unlikely that she will find joy in the sexual relationship. It may even lead her into a bottomless abyss of pain! If she marries a husband who is full of energy, healthy, and has absolutely no venereal disease, he can immediately lead his wife into a realm of infinite joy. She will suddenly feel the value of marriage in life. Therefore, the love between husband and wife is deep, they organize a happy family, and give birth to clever children, living in harmony and joy. What a happiness in this world!</p>
<p>Why do men have venereal diseases, or why does their sexual function decline sharply after marriage? According to the diagnosis of doctors, it is entirely due to early-year self-pollution and spermatorrhea, or post-marital debauchery and licentiousness, or excessive use of the brain and overwork, which damages the essence, leading to the exhaustion of reproductive gland fluid, and outbreaks of premature ejaculation, impotence, scattered energy, prolonged infertility, neurasthenia, and other symptoms. Therefore, in the sexual life between husband and wife, they cannot coordinate with each other and be intimate, or even cannot perform sexually at all, thus betraying the youth of their beloved wife and wronging their own lives. How guilty is this!</p>
<p>According to the experience of world-renowned doctors and myself over the years, the treatment method is to take the reproductive hormone preparation "Reproductive Hormone," which is the most appropriate and effective. Because this medicine is refined from the reproductive gland hormones extracted from strong animals, its quality is the purest, and its medicinal properties are the most effective. After taking it, it can generate spirit, strengthen the kidneys, nourish the brain, and activate blood within one day and night, exerting a positive effect. If you continue to take it, it will certainly be able to fundamentally cure the above symptoms, and your body will become healthier, achieving the effect of returning to youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Himitot's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate, stop ejaculation, and achieve even more rapid results!</p>

<h3 id="e48">The Value of Breasts in Fitness and Beauty <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Towering and elastic breasts are a necessary condition for healthy and beautiful women!</p>
<p>Although it is said: "Buddhas are dressed in gold, people are dressed in clothes." But these are just some superficial masks, only deceiving the shallow and ignorant. People with discerning eyes will definitely pay attention to the substance of female fitness and beauty. The substance of female fitness and beauty includes towering and elastic breasts, developed and plump buttocks, and fair and rosy cheeks, with the towering breasts occupying a major position. Because the development of the breasts can determine whether her ovarian function (sexual function) is sound? If the ovarian function is sound, then the metabolism must also be vigorous. Therefore, not only do the breasts, buttocks, and other female characteristics have good development, but also the skin, muscles, blood, and endocrine glands are full of new cells. Therefore, the skin is naturally fair, the blood color is naturally bright red, and the muscles are naturally plump. Therefore, the cheeks are naturally rosy, and the color of the lips is even more鲜艷欲滴, like a ripe cherry. If this kind of woman is given a happy smile and a graceful and charming attitude, it is simply like a flower greeting people in the gentle breeze of spring. How glorious and fortunate this is! If she suffers from irregular menstruation, vaginal discharge, and other hidden gynecological diseases, her ovarian function will be destroyed, and her metabolism will also decline. The breasts will not have good development, and even if they have had good development, they will gradually wither. The face will appear haggard, withered, yellow, or pale. Before she is old, wrinkles will appear. These kinds of women, even if dressed in silk and brocade and covered in makeup, are only enough to show their ugliness and vulgarity, and are avoided by men and abandoned by their husbands. The tragic prospects are simply unbearable to imagine. The only remedy is, according to the experience of world-renowned gynecologists and myself, everyone unanimously praises taking the ovarian preparation "Female Reproductive Hormone," which is the most appropriate and effective. Because this medicine was invented by the medical sage Stanislaus after more than 30 years of arduous experimentation, and has been verified by the chemical tests of many famous European and American doctors, confirming its great efficacy and dominant nature. After taking it, it can promote ovarian function and make it healthy, and the metabolism will also be vigorous. Therefore, the above symptoms can be fundamentally cured, and it can make the breasts erect and the face rosy, enhancing fitness and beauty.</p>

<p>The municipal authorities have already presented their negotiations with the Japanese side to the Public Works Department regarding the interference of Japanese military police in the Chinese Cabinet in the western Shanghai area and the coercion of rickshaw pullers to obtain "donations." The Public Works Department's Information Office issued a public statement saying, "Regarding the case of the locked-down road area outside the boundary, in addition to the Chairman of the Public Works Department already sending a letter to the Japanese Consul General to raise the issue, he has also sent a letter requesting the Japanese Consul General to pay attention to the interference suffered by police officers in that area and the need for rickshaws operating on roads owned by the Department to obtain Chinese licenses."</p>
<p>Japanese Military Police Continue Searches in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>There are still two places where iron wire obstacles have not been removed. One is at the southern end of the corner of Datong Road and Yidingpan Road, and the other is between Hong'en Hospital and Falachai Automobile Company. It is hoped that these two obstacles will also be removed within a day or two. The wooden gate of Wangjia Lane Zhongxing Village on Datong Road is still closed, with two servants monitoring everything at the entrance of the lane. The alley area of Zhu'anbang along Yidingpan Road, which the Japanese side considers a "nest of terrorists," remains blocked as before. When reporters passed by the area at 4 PM yesterday, there were seven or eight Japanese military police and several servants searching. All the shops in the area have resumed business.</p>
<p>British Cars Resumed Operation Yesterday</p>
<p>On the side of the British Public Automobile Company, because the obstacles in the western Shanghai area have been removed, they sent one or two of routes 1 and 9 around 11 AM yesterday to test Yuyuan Road. In the afternoon, routes 1, 2, 9, and 3, as well as route 20 of the British trolleybus, operated as usual on Datong Road and Yuyuan Road. However, only half of the buses entered yesterday, and half still used Jing'an Temple as the terminus. It is expected that the situation will return to its original state before the 30th of last month today. As for bus route 14, because the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Datong Road has not been opened since the lockdown, it still uses the intersection of Datong Road and Difeng Road as the terminus. As for the so-called "Western Shanghai Citizens' Bus," it disappeared yesterday and was no longer found.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses During the Lockdown</p>
<p>It is heard that the British Public Automobile Company lost more than 9,000 yuan per day during this lockdown period. The British trolleybus also suffered considerable losses. Therefore, the total losses of the two companies during the half-month lockdown are in the range of 70,000 to 80,000. Rickshaws with concession licenses are still unable to enter the road area built across the boundary unless they have a "municipal license" or the words "Special Permit for Passage by the Western Shanghai Transportation Committee" are pasted on the back of the vehicle; all are excluded from the road construction outside the boundary. As for the fact that Japanese buses have been operating in the locked-down area of western Shanghai without permission and infringing on the exclusive privileges of the British Public Automobile and Tramway Company, the Public Works Department filed a protest with the Japanese Consul General at the beginning of this week. The Public Works Department has not yet received a response, but it is generally expected that Japanese buses will stop operating in the western Shanghai area, because Japanese officials have already stated in advance that Japanese buses operating in western Shanghai are a "temporary measure."</p>

<p>Ms. Pearl S. Buck, the famous American novelist who lived in China for a long time, recently attended a new book exhibition held by the Boston Forum and met with journalists. She expressed her views on the Sino-Japanese war. According to Ms. Buck, the situation in China has greatly improved. She also said that Japan's situation with China is the same as Germany's situation with England. Japan is now racking its brains to figure out what the next step should be. She feels that China is even less likely to be defeated than it was a year ago, and it has now reached a level of determination, so she believes that China will never be defeated, and continuing to bomb China will not be effective. Because China is so large, bombing cannot achieve its purpose. Japan's bombing is like flicking a lion's skin with a finger, which is not enough to kill it.</p>

<p>The Social News Agency reported that a major case of assassination of a Japanese public official occurred in the Hongkou district the day before yesterday. The case occurred at 8 PM the night before. Four assassins broke into the Deswei Road residence of Kubo Tian, a Major of the Japanese Shanghai Secret Service, and opened fire on Kubo Tian, who was in the room, but he dodged the shot. When the four assassins fled in a panic, because the Japanese side had received the news, they quickly dispatched a large number of Japanese troops and police to rush to the scene. It is heard that three of the four assassins were captured alive on the spot and are now under strict investigation by the Japanese side.</p>

<p>The British Chapel on Jiujiang Road in this port will begin its Christmas season on the 12th. On that night, dramas and reports will be performed, which will be fully responsible for by more than 120 members of the church's youth fellowship. The costumes, props, and sets have all been designed and prepared in many ways and are extremely wonderful. In order to allow all sectors to recognize this kind of theatrical art, the church has scheduled to screen it again at the Jiujiang Road address at 6 PM today. Outside visitors are welcome to visit and are not charged any fees, and all donations will be given to Bishop Ke Xin of the Hangzhou District to help the Chinese refugees in that area. This kind of performance is of great historical value. In the Middle Ages, it was popular everywhere. In modern times, it has made immortal contributions in art, especially by changing its form and retaining its content. Every Christmas, this kind of performance is performed. Throughout the UK, from the churches in small rural towns to Canterbury Chapel in London, it is adopted. However, the British Chapel's performance of this kind of drama this year is still a historic first.</p>

<p>According to a message released by the Public Works Department's Information Office yesterday, "The British China Public Automobile Company, in view of the continued decline in exchange rates and the increased cost of various imported materials, as well as the increase in employee salaries, which has led to a sharp increase in operating expenses and difficulty in maintaining operations, has been forced to inform the Public Works Department of a proposed increase in bus fares of an average of 35 percent to supplement funds. The amended fare schedule will be implemented from the 17th of this month. It has been found that the proposed increase does not exceed the maximum amount stipulated in the franchise operating regulations."</p>

<p>In order to thank customers for their kindness, our store has specifically decided to hold a rice giveaway method from September 1, 1940 to December 15, 1941. If you purchase five dou of rice from our store, the invoice number will be used as the rice winning standard. The invoices drawn each month will be from the 16th of each month to the 15th of the following month. The last two digits of the Shanghai Central Savings Society's monthly lottery number will be used as the basis. Those with the same last two digits will be given five catties of high-quality glutinous rice or glutinous flour by our store for making cakes, dumplings, and cooking porridge. If the rice purchased on the invoice exceeds five dou, the rice will be given by analogy, but it must not exceed ten catties. However, the Central Savings Society has added a second special lottery since November. Now, due to the strange rise in rice prices, the rice giveaway method will temporarily use the first special lottery as the standard to avoid too much sacrifice. Once rice prices are slightly lower, the second special lottery will be used to increase the prize amount. A separate announcement will be made at that time.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Tribute Rice to Arrive in Port Soon; Rangoon Rice Already Ordered; Public Works Department Claims No Rice Shortage Problem; More Than 20,000 Bags of Flat-Priced Flour Already Withdrawn <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Great America Evening News said that Public Works Department officials said today (the 14th) that the 10,000 tons of Saigon rice that were previously scheduled to be shipped to Shanghai can be loaded and arrive here this month, so there is no rice shortage problem in this city. According to Mr. Matti, the head of the Vietnamese economic delegation to Japan, who traveled to Japan via the seven seas, 8,000 tons of tribute rice will be carried by the Dada No. 14 ship, and the remaining 2,000 tons will be shipped to Shanghai by other ships. The city has existing rice stores, along with the tribute rice that will be shipped soon, which is enough to meet the needs. In addition, the city has ordered at least 10,000 tons of rice from Rangoon, which can be shipped to Shanghai when the city's existing rice stores gradually decrease, to prevent a rice shortage in the winter in case of emergency. Rangoon rice is cheaper than Vietnamese rice and is especially popular with the poor.</p>
<p>Flat Powder Priced at 18 Yuan Per Bag</p>
<p>The Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the French Municipal Council have taken joint action to maintain the price of flour in this port. The plan is to withdraw 10% of the flour imported from abroad and hand it over to reliable flour merchants for sale at the lowest price. The Food Committee of this port announced that 11,600 bags of flour transported to this port by the Nanjing ship have been withdrawn, and another 6,000 bags will be withdrawn for sale to designated merchants at a price of 18 yuan per bag (49 pounds), which will be resold to the public by the merchants at a small profit.</p>
<p>Mr. Xi Yushu Advocates Collective Purchase</p>
<p>Accountant Xi Yushu yesterday published a "Review of the Rice Panic Prevention Problem," which stated that in the early summer of last year, due to the scarcity of domestic rice sources and the tight foreign exchange for foreign rice, rice prices soared. The Public Works Department then set a price limit. On June 23, 1939, the price limit for domestic rice was 21 yuan and foreign rice was 17 yuan. On July 17 of the same year, the price limit for domestic rice was 20 yuan and foreign rice was 16 yuan. On December 9 of the same year, the price limit for domestic rice was 40 yuan and foreign rice was 30 yuan. Although there were price limits, few people followed them. The Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association was then organized, and the association raised a fund of 1 million yuan for the purpose of purchasing and storing foreign rice to adjust the market. People enthusiastically registered, and it increased to 2 million yuan. At the same time, all parties registered with the association for collective rice purchases, and the funds were used as a down payment for purchasing and storing 200,000 bags of foreign rice. However, at the time, some people thought that rice prices were high and the lives of the poor were pitiful, so they strongly advocated first handling flat-priced sales, and the rice fund that had been recognized for purchase was then used to handle flat-priced sales.</p>
<p>The motivation for recognizing the collection of funds to prepare base rice was invisibly stopped, and it has been delayed until now, which is a pity. Recently, the rice shortage situation has increased unabated, and social opinions attribute it to the collective rice purchase being a mistake, believing that the collective rice purchase is not enough to solve the rice shortage, but instead contributes to the rice shortage. The reason is nothing more than believing that the collective rice purchase is enough to promote the hoarding trend, promote the rice price surge, and be in a position to compete for profits with rice stores. These three statements are certainly not enough to refute the justification. The basic reason for the collective rice purchase is, on the one hand, the establishment of consumer cooperation, and on the other hand, the storage of prepared rice, to judge and flatten the rampant market price by means of swallowing and spitting. Looking back to the beginning of the price limit, the bottom of the rice stock in the city was only more than 100,000 bags. In a few days, the stock number reached the 100,000-bag mark. Since the advocacy of collective rice purchases, the bottom has been thickened, which shows considerable progress. It can be traced back to the collective rice purchase, which has become a hoarding, price-raising, and profit-competing view with the rice industry.</p>
<p>It is Not Difficult to Explain</p>
<p>But even if there is a stock today, in this environment and at this time, it is really difficult to trust that there is no possibility of rising prices again. Moreover, in the future, there may still be factors that promote the rise in rice prices: (1) changes in foreign exchange rates, (2) another increase in water freight, (3) rice price increases or export bans in the producing areas, (4) the autumn of the green and yellow unconnectable seasons in the rice areas, and other unpredictable events. All of these have a crisis that promotes the rise in rice prices. To make a reasonable solution, why not seek its origin, that is, to try to dredge the source and thicken the stock as much as possible, then from the increase in supply, the rice price can naturally be stable and flat without the prohibition of the price limit. Conversely, even if the authorities have prohibitions, if there is no rice available for purchase on the market, its effectiveness cannot be produced. However, there are also several difficulties in the progress of collective rice purchases today: (1) shortage of weight on arrival, (2) no definite date of arrival for the goods that have arrived, (3) want to set the final and hope two points, (1) do not interrupt the flat-priced sales, (2) purchase and prepare base rice, establish public warehouses, and hope that all sectors will help as much as possible, rice subsidy plus more than six dou</p>

<p>This city's English-language China Press is the leader among English-language newspapers, with daily sales of more than 10,000 copies. Subscribers are all over the Far East and Europe and the United States. The newspaper's more than 300 Chinese employees recently found that the existing wages were not enough to cover expenses due to the sharp increase in rice prices and the high cost of living. On the 8th of this month, they submitted 12 conditions for improving treatment to the management and asked the management to respond within 48 hours. The deadline did not expire on the 10th. Because the time limit was too short and they could not consider it deeply, the management consulted with the labor and extended the deadline by two days. At 10 AM on the 12th, all the employees gathered in the main office on the first floor of the building and elected six representatives to visit the manager. At that time, the management only allowed one item for the rice subsidy. Because all daily necessities also increased with the rice price, it was difficult to maintain life if the living allowance was not appropriately increased. After several consultations, they could not get the gist of it and went on strike. Later, the management asked Xie Baosheng to come forward to mediate, and the comprador Yang Wenqing ran around and negotiated openly with the labor representatives Yao Liren, Peng De'an, Zhang Dingyu, Zhang Qinsheng, and Kang Jiwen, and on the morning of yesterday at 10 AM, the management agreed to increase the rice subsidy by 6 dou and 2.5 liters, the living allowance by 30%, and the minimum severance pay to 1,000 yuan and other three preconditions. The remaining nine conditions were reserved and will be discussed and negotiated by labor and management after resuming work, in the hope of guaranteeing the minimum living standard of employees.</p>
<p>Some Elevator Workers Return to Work</p>
<p>After the workers of the American Otis Elevator Company went on strike the day before yesterday, all companies, apartments, hotels, etc. that used Otis elevators were extremely inconvenient because the strikers removed the machine parts and the elevators could not be started. However, the problem was soon eliminated by engineers fitting other parts. According to the Great America Evening News yesterday, some of the 50 striking workers have returned to work as usual, so the dispute can be resolved soon. Also, the high-end Western clothing companies along Sichuan Road also announced a strike yesterday due to the failure to request a pay raise. Although the management tried its best to maintain operations, customers were greatly inconvenienced due to delayed orders. The Public Works Department has sent Chang to mediate, and there is hope for a resolution.</p>
<p>Tailei Telephone Operators Request</p>
<p>There are more than 50 telephone operators in this city's Tailei Automobile Co., Ltd. and its branches. It is difficult for them to maintain their lives, and they were forced to submit nine requests for improved treatment to the company authorities at 8 AM the day before yesterday (the 13th) and organized the "Tailei Friends Association," while requesting the company to recognize it. According to the association, they are not lazy in order to serve the community and maintain transportation lines, and they still work as usual every day, waiting for the management to consider and respond, and they are purely forced by the problem of life and have no other purpose.</p>

<p>The issue of subsidies for Chinese police in the French police station has been officially resolved yesterday afternoon. All Chinese police officers expressed satisfaction with the increased subsidies in this resolution. The following is the information obtained by the Social News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>The French Authorities</p>
<p>Had Already Considered</p>
<p>Director of Police Fabre personally requested the French Municipal Council to announce the subsidy method for Chinese police as soon as possible, so that all Chinese police officers could serve with peace of mind. After detailed calculation, the Municipal Council decided on the method, which was originally scheduled to be announced the day before yesterday, but due to lack of time, it was rescheduled to be officially announced yesterday. The subsidy method was officially announced at 4 PM yesterday and immediately conveyed to all police stations for compliance. According to the Social News Agency reporter,</p>
<p>Each Chinese Police Officer</p>
<p>The past 70% subsidy fee has now been increased to 140%. The special labor bonus has been increased from 6 yuan to 25 yuan. After the implementation of this subsidy, the lowest-level fifth-class trainee Chinese police officer can receive 83 yuan and 8 jiao per month, plus a rice subsidy of 5 dou, and can receive more than 120 yuan per month. The rice subsidy has also been stipulated to be calculated according to the rice market on the 5th of each month. It is also learned that from January next year, each trainee Chinese police officer will be given a salary increase of 2 yuan. Therefore, after the subsidy method was announced, the Chinese police officers were all satisfied.</p>

<p>According to a recent study of wage issues completed by the Industrial and Social Department of the Public Works Department, the various incomes of workers in Chinese factories this year have increased by more than one time compared to last year and by two and a half times compared to 1936. The index of the above income was 242.47 this year, 119.09 last year, and 100 in 1936. It can be seen from this that the Chinese factory authorities have made efforts to adjust wages. However, the actual wage index was 44.85 in November of this year, a decrease of 13.74 compared to last year. This means that although workers' income has increased, the monetary value of their income in November of this year is only 44.85 percent of what they earned previously. A survey of the income of workers in foreign factories has also been conducted, but the amount cannot be obtained at present. The following is a comparison table of the various indices of workers' income and living expenses over the past five years. The various indices in 1936 are equal to 100.</p>
<p>Note: The annual full-year living expenses index is not necessarily as high as 406.2, so the annual actual wage index is also not as low as 44.85.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs, in accordance with Article 17 of the Provisional Regulations for Encouraging Industrial Technology, has rewarded Wang Huawen of the Meteorological Institute of the Academia Sinica in Beibei for inventing the "Almighty Scale," granting a five-year new-type patent. The inventor of the "Almighty Scale," feeling that the structure of commonly used steelyards on the market is relatively simple, and because the units of weight are not decimal, calculating prices from the obtained weight easily leads to errors in mental calculation, has applied mechanics and formulas to design in detail a steelyard that can directly indicate prices. Similar in form and structure to ordinary steelyards, one type is a hanging scale, while another type, entirely mechanically constructed with gold plating, can stand on a base and is a platform scale. The hanging scale is made of a wooden rod, and the scale tie is a knife-edge type. To the left of the tie is suspended a weighing pan, which can pass straight through a slot in the spine of the scale rod and move left and right. There are graduations on the slot spine to indicate the position. Further to the left is a balancing body with the same quality as the pan, which can move in another corresponding slot. However, its graduations are in the opposite direction, used to eliminate the change in torque on the left side of the scale tie caused by the movement of the weighing pan. To the right of the tie is suspended a movable counterweight, used to balance the goods weighed on the left pan. The graduations on the right rod are coarse or fine depending on its size, and on one end, facing the user, is also engraved a comparative table of interconversion graduations between jin and liang. Furthermore, a bubble level is added to the end of the scale tie on the left. The distances and lengths of all points on the scale have been calculated and determined. It is reported that the ministry will change the name of this "Almighty Scale" to "Dual-Purpose Hanging Scale."</p>

<p>Salvation Army Major Ma Ruishan yesterday discussed the progress of the plan to shelter 1,500 beggars, stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council will allocate fourteen-tenths of the entertainment tax from the Public Concession to fund the beggar shelter. The economic affairs of the shelter will be managed by the Rotary Club and the Shanghai Municipal Council, while the Salvation Army will be responsible for the management work. The shelter is expected to be completed within the year and open on New Year's Day next year, housing 1,500 beggars from the streets of Shanghai. The water bath facilities in the shelter are expected to be installed by the 22nd of this month, and some beggars will be sheltered on that day. To date, 28 bays of wooden houses have been built in the shelter, and the rest can be completed shortly after Christmas, it is said. Also, an official from the Shanghai Municipal Council said that they are planning to invite newspaper reporters from the city to visit the beggar shelter next week.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Australian Envoy to Japan Speaks: Fighting Together with Britain, Supplying Britain with All Manpower and Material Resources, Believing that Civilization and Freedom Will Surely Prevail, Australian Envoy Left Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Take Up His New Post in Japan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>John Latham, the Australian envoy to Japan, left Shanghai for Japan yesterday morning. Before his departure, he gave a broadcast to the British community in Shanghai at the Democratic Lecture Hall at 8:10 PM on the 13th. Latham said that Australians voluntarily joined the war and vowed to strive for survival with all their strength. Latham first mentioned that the wives of some British expatriates in the Far East have now been evacuated to Australia, where the climate and environment are good, and the food supply is very sufficient. He also welcomed young people to go to Australia. Australia's civilization is based on autonomous governance and is determined to fight together with all the territories of Great Britain against the dictatorship of Germany and Italy. There are no concentration camps or political prisoners in Australia. We are also tired of hearing about the so-called "New European Order."</p>
<p>Australia's Military Preparations Are Extremely Substantial</p>
<p>Australia's national defense program requires a sum of 453,750,000 pounds by 1942. Due to the needs of the times, this amount must be increased again. The Royal Australian Army has now raised 90,000 people, and veteran officers have been sent to the Near East. In addition, there are 80,000 people responsible for the Australian defense local militia, which will gradually increase to 150,000 people. At the beginning of the European war, Australia had six cruisers and five destroyers, which have now increased. The Australian ship Sydney sank the Italian ship Colleoni in the Mediterranean. The Australian fleet is now working with the British Navy to transport supplies to the Near East and the United Kingdom. The strength of the Australian Navy, in addition to cruisers, destroyers, minesweepers, etc., also includes 30 auxiliary ships and 200 merchant ships, which are equipped with weapons by Australia. Shipbuilding capacity is also increasing. A Large Amount of Raw Materials Supplied to Britain</p>
<p>As of October this year, the strength of the Australian Air Force is 40,000 people, and it can train 1,000 people per month and can still be increased. Australia can also manufacture bombers and engines itself, and at the same time, it is purchasing 100 heavy bombers and reconnaissance aircraft from the United States, as well as giant airships to defend the Australian coast. Munitions production can not only be self-sufficient but also supply Britain and other parts of the empire. Raw materials such as wool, milk, wheat, canned food, zinc, aluminum copper, and tungsten are also supplied to Britain in large quantities. The total amount of Australian commercial orders has exceeded 120 million pounds, and Britain has priority rights. Although Britain has encountered crises in this war, it will surely win due to the full support of the various autonomous territories. We also believe that civilization and freedom will ultimately prevail.</p>

<p>Qinyi Paper Co., Ltd., located at No. 94, Lane 25, Xinjiapo Road, specializes in manufacturing kraft paper, gray newsprint, etc., which sell well in the market. Its business is quite prosperous. The distribution office was previously located at No. 20, Lane 212, Tianjin Road, and has now been moved to No. 12, Lane 542, Baike Road. Wang Bolei (56 years old), from Nanxiang, was hired as the factory director. His family resides at No. 1, Guba Xincun, Guba Road, in the French Concession, for more than a year. Because the factory is far away, he specially rented a private car (commonly known as a "wild chicken car"), license plate number 7502, from the lane to pick him up in the morning and evening. Yesterday at around 10:15 AM, Wang went to the factory as usual. When the car drove to the intersection of Jiaozhou Road and Xinjiapo Road, only a few steps away from the factory, four bandits suddenly emerged from the roadside. Two of them, holding guns, shouted to stop the car and drove the driver away. The bandits then swarmed up. One of them acted as the driver and fled west along Xinjiapo Road, and their whereabouts are unknown. After the incident, the driver went directly to the factory to report Wang's kidnapping. The factory then reported the incident to the relevant police station, ordering Chinese and foreign police officers to rush to the scene for investigation. The driver was taken to the police station for questioning. Meanwhile, the search for the kidnappers was underway. As of 5:00 PM, the car had not yet been found.</p>

<p>In room 716 of the Yangzi Hotel on Hankou Road, there was a traveler in his twenties who registered as Li Hongsheng from Nanxiang, a student at Datong University. Since closing himself in the room, he had not come out. At around 7:30 AM yesterday, the hotel staff seemed to hear groaning coming from the room. They urgently opened the door to investigate and saw that the man was unconscious. Noticing a bottle of poison beside him, they knew he had taken poison. They immediately called an ambulance and sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment. It was later learned that his real name was Gao Hongfan, and Li Hongsheng was an alias. His sudden decision to commit suicide was entirely due to a love affair gone wrong. After treatment by the doctor, his life is said to be out of danger, but he refused to disclose the details of his suicide attempt and did not want his family to know about the incident.</p>

<p>The Yongda Noodle Shop at No. 121, Limei Road, in the French Concession, is owned by Ouyang Shuigen from Danyang. On the 10th of this month, 180 yuan in cash was stolen from the shop. He suspected that his niece, A'ai (21 years old this year, married, and renting a room in the shop's annex with her husband), had stolen it. He immediately reported it to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest A'ai for investigation. Since there was no concrete evidence, she was released. A'ai returned to the shop, feeling humiliated and disgraced by the false accusation, and in despair, she decided to commit suicide. That night at 8:00 PM, she climbed onto the roof and jumped off, falling in front of No. 203, Kaizi'er Road. Someone noticed and called the police, who sent her to Guangci Hospital. Due to internal injuries from the fall, the treatment was ineffective, and she died at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday.</p>

<p>Various academic groups in Shanghai jointly initiated a public memorial service for Mr. Zhang Shanzi at Gongdelin, Pike Road, from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM today. During the memorial service, no formal ceremonies will be held, and attendees may come and pay their respects at any time. All those who admire Zhang's art are welcome to attend. It is also reported that New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, Tiger Balm Yong An Tang, Sheng Sheng Art Company, Huacheng Tobacco Company, and others will distribute various items on-site to commemorate him. Furthermore, it is reported that over a thousand yuan in condolence money has been received, demonstrating the admiration of all sectors for Zhang's art and charitable deeds. Father Youliang Company displayed photos of Mr. Zhang's funeral in Chongqing at the venue, "The left picture is Zhang's painting of a tiger."</p>
<p>Brief Biography of Zhang Shanzi</p>
<p>Zhong Yinjun's account of Mr. Zhang Shanzi's life states: Mr. Zhang's given name was Ze, his courtesy name Shanzi, and he was from Neijiang, Sichuan. There were four brothers; Mr. Zhang was the second, the eldest. The third was Lizheng, the fourth was Wenxiu, and Daqian was the eighth, the youngest. His mother was skilled in painting. Mr. Zhang inherited the family tradition early and later devoted himself to the revolution, living in exile for more than ten years. During the Republic period, around 1917-1918, he successively held positions in the Presidential Palace and the Northwest Army. In 1923, he served as magistrate of the Santai Salt Field, earning a reputation for his administration. He was especially known for painting tigers. Later, because of his aging parents and weariness of official life, he moved to Shanghai and Jiashan, focusing on painting and calligraphy with his brother Daqian. Later, he moved to the Wangshi Garden in Suzhou, raising a tiger and three cranes, enjoying himself among them daily. Therefore, his works are deeply imbued with natural charm. Mr. Zhang was proficient in figures, landscapes, flowers, and birds; painting tigers was merely a way to earn a living. He was sincere, honest, humble, and frugal—a true gentleman. In 1919, he went to Europe and America to promote Chinese art, and everywhere he went, he was admired by all. This year, he returned to China and died of illness in the capital, at the age of sixty.</p>
<p>Admiration from Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Hu Guigeng's account of Mr. Zhang's travels to the south, where he was warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese, states: In 1935, Mr. Zhang went to the Nanyang Islands to promote Chinese painting and develop Huangshan. Although I wrote letters of introduction to many friends to host him, I was still worried that the cultural level of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang was slightly lower, which would be a disservice to Mr. Zhang's good intentions. However, upon his arrival, the overseas Chinese of all circles warmly welcomed him. The Kunzhong brothers of the Hukong Tiger Clan were particularly impressed. This was because Mr. Zhang's warm heart, righteousness, and adherence to traditional values resonated with the psychology of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang. Mr. Zhang's paintings, on the other hand, were spread through his personality. As a result, Chinese painting became noticed in Nanyang. Since then, Chinese painters who have gone to Nanyang to promote their art have all achieved satisfactory results. All of this is due to Mr. Zhang's pioneering efforts. Furthermore, Jiang Danshu's elegiac couplet for Mr. Zhang reads: "The tiger general stands in the art world, watching crows disturb the array in the twilight, the cold crab walks sideways; surely his miraculous brush will sweep away all." "The Art Forest mourns the doctor; just as the raft returned, the idle garden summoned him, and suddenly the news came that a star had fallen in Sichuan, shocking the world."</p>

<p>Xia Jinbiao (28 years old), from Wuhu, came to Shanghai with his friend Wang Dequan in October to sell cloth. They were lured to a gambling den in western Shanghai by bad friends and lost all the money from the cloth, leaving them unable to make a living. They took the risk and embarked on a life of crime. On the 18th of this month at 10:45 AM, he gathered three fugitives, including the escaped Rong Kun, each carrying a handgun, and went to the Daishengchang Rice Store at No. 50 and No. 54 Yuanchang Road. They pointed their guns at the store staff and forbade them from making noise, robbing them of valuables worth 1,400 yuan.</p>
<p>Fleeing in Different Directions</p>
<p>The rice store staff and the cashier Qian A'san followed behind. Near Xinji浜 Road, they encountered Inspector Pang Ruiqing, Detective Li Dewei, and Number 796 Chinese Constable, and Number 191 Indian Constable Yinda Xing from the Huishan Police Station. They reported the incident to them, who went forward to apprehend the robbers. In desperation, Xia Jinbiao opened fire to resist arrest. The Chinese and foreign detectives also drew their guns and returned fire, resulting in:</p>
<p>Injured and Captured</p>
<p>Indian Constable Number 191 was shot in a vital area and sent to the Ward Road Police Hospital, where he died despite treatment. Xia Jinbiao was sent to the First Special Court.

The court listened to the report and awaited a suitable sentence. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the sentencing in the Third Criminal Court. Xia Jinbiao was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for conspiring to rob with deadly weapons and</p>

<h3 id="e73">Charity Bazaar for Children's Welfare Association <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Yang</p>
<p>After walking to the southern end of Yuqiaqing Road, stepping onto the connecting point of Min Ti Diaoying Road, crossing the concrete "fortress," entering the French Concession, and passing in front of the crowded "Great World," the first building that rushes into view is the nine-story YMCA.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the YMCA, a white cloth banner was hung, which read "Shanghai Children's Welfare Association Fundraising Charity Bazaar of Calligraphy, Paintings, and Goods." Walking into the building, which is three feet lower than the road, and pushing the revolving door forward, there are two separate cement staircases on the left and right. Originally, this place was a crowded place at ordinary times. Today, with the addition of the charity bazaar, it will naturally be more lively and more crowded.</p>
<p>Upstairs, this is considered the second floor of the YMCA, with the auditorium and library located here. However, today's charity bazaar items are displayed in the passageway in the middle. The first stall is toothbrushes, facing each other are men's and women's leather shoes. The marked prices seem to be cheaper than those currently sold on the market. Inside are thermos bottles, soap, stationery, children's books, embroidery, toys, towels, and many other daily necessities. The general prices are probably cheaper than those on the market!</p>
<p>Occasionally, shifting your gaze from the tabletop to the wall, what catches your eye is a wall full of Chinese paintings, both framed and unframed, priced from five to one or two hundred yuan. What is particularly eye-catching here is a Xiang embroidery glass screen, four panels in a row, embroidered with four birds: peacocks, phoenixes, brocade chickens, and cranes. The craftsmanship is exquisite, and the producer is described as "an old lady," which cannot but make me feel respect. The price is 1,000 yuan in national currency, which I think is not expensive, especially in the eyes of those friends who spend thousands of gold coins in those speculative markets and pleasure dens without the slightest bit of stinginess; it's not even a trivial matter.</p>
<p>"What's the price of this painting?" A dapperly dressed wealthy guest pointed to a Chinese painting without a price tag.</p>
<p>"I don't know. Please wait, may I go and ask?"</p>
<p>The person in charge came and quoted a price of twenty yuan. The guest indifferently took out a large stack of new ten-yuan bills from his coat pocket and paid the bill.</p>
<p>Going up to the third floor, people felt scarce. The furnishings on the third floor are all surrounded by magnificent golden frames and oil paintings. The highest price, said to be four hundred yuan, still has no customer. The rest of the middle four aisles are filled with antiques and curios. Perhaps because of the display of these items, people's emotions did not seem as lively as downstairs.</p>
<p>Walking out of the YMCA building, it was already 4:00 PM. The street lights were just lit, and people were surging in the dark.</p>
<p>This hour or so of time spent was probably not meaningless, and the cause of welfare for poor children, which is not yet widespread in China, is worth promoting. The inculcation of education for beggar children also has special significance today, but this is still a "small minority" within the "general public." We hope that it can be promoted to the road of implementing mass education, if the proceeds from this charity bazaar are high!</p>
<p>This is a social undertaking, a contribution beneficial to the nation and the country. On the one hand, it requires the support of people from all walks of life, and on the other hand, it is hoped that the staff will do their best. (Note: Donations can be sent to the YMCA at Ba Xian Qiao and forwarded to the Children's Welfare Association.)</p>
<h3 id="e74">Home Medicine Cabinet <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>For the sake of maintaining and expanding the family's health, it is very important to have a home medicine cabinet in the family. How to make a home medicine cabinet can be said to be common sense that every housewife must have. Below is a good way to make a home medicine cabinet.</p>
<p>First, find a suitable place in the house and determine a size to prepare for placing the home medicine cabinet. Just tell the carpenter your needs, and you can have him make a clever wooden box. After it is made, you can paint it in the color you like.</p>
<p>The following medicines are necessary in a home medicine cabinet:</p>
<p>(1) Epsom Salts: This is a laxative. It is best to take it every morning when you wake up. Use a tablespoon and put it in half a cup of warm water.</p>
<p>(2) Castor Oil: It is a mild laxative. You can prepare a bottle and use 6 to 12 ounces when necessary.</p>
<p>(3) Magnesia: This is a relatively strong laxative. There are now tasteless products on sale. Take about four teaspoons at a time.</p>
<p>(4) Agar Agar: This is a medicine for people who have long-term constipation. It is not absorbed by the intestines. The dosage is one to two tablespoons.</p>
<p>(5) Boric Acid: It has many uses. When you have an earache, you can put a few drops in mixed water to wash your ears.</p>
<p>(6) Zinc Oxide Ointment: It has miraculous effects on skin problems, wounds, sunburn, etc.</p>
<p>(7) Aspro: This is a pain reliever. It can relieve any pain in about ten minutes. It is absolutely safe and reliable and is produced by Nicholas Aspirin Co., Ltd. Take one or two tablets.</p>
<p>(8) Tincture of Iodine: This is a disinfectant. It can be used on small skin wounds. Use a cotton swab wrapped around a toothpick, then apply it.</p>
<p>(9) Bicarbonate of Soda: It can be used as a mouthwash. It is also effective for stomachaches. When the skin is irritated, you can put it in the bath water.</p>
<p>(10) Camphorated Oil: It can be used for coughs, etc.</p>
<p>In addition, gauze, bandages, adhesive tape, etc., are all necessary supplies.</p>

<h3 id="e75">In the Last Four Minutes, Li Yichen's One Kick: China Defeats England; International Cup Soccer Week One <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>In the first week of the International Cup soccer tournament, the Chinese team had a victorious start yesterday. In the last four minutes, Li Yichen scored a goal on the ground, eliminating England 1-0 at the Recreation Ground. Twelve thousand fans were overjoyed. The Chinese team's lineup is strong this year. England, due to the departure of British troops from Shanghai, suffered a great loss in strength and formed a team hastily. However, thanks to the excellent performance of goalkeeper Willie, who made countless saves, the Chinese team was unable to break through. The first half ended 0-0. In the second half, Li Yichen missed a penalty kick. Fortunately, in the last four minutes, Li Yichen received a brilliant pass from Jia Youliang and shot fiercely from ten yards in front of the goal, breaking the net. The stadium erupted in cheers. The Chinese team used this valuable goal to win and advance to the semi-finals.</p>
<p>Chinese Team</p>
<p>Qin Bigao</p>
<p>Zhuang Youren Li Ning</p>
<p>Han Longhai Huang Kehou Liang Shutang</p>
<p>Jia Youliang Li Yichen Dai Linjing Sun Jinshun Wan Jin</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>Willie</p>
<p>Jim Wah Wah Chi Mada</p>
<p>Simmons Te Fei Bo</p>
<p>FG</p>
<p>Pei Gan E Jipi Walker Deng Edward Edward</p>
<p>Each has its merits. The English lineup was exactly the same as previously announced. In terms of strength, China was indeed stronger. The English team had very few attacks. Simmons in the center defense line performed remarkably, and goalkeeper Willie was agile, preventing China from scoring repeatedly. The Chinese defense was also good, with Huang Kehou and Zhuang Youren being particularly excellent. Li Ning remained one of the weakest members of the defense line. Qin Bigao had few opportunities to attack, so there was no special performance. Forward Li Yichen was indeed capable, and Jia Youliang also worked very hard. Ah Dai made several brilliant shots, but they were all saved by the opposing goalkeeper. Sun Jinshun's footwork was unskilled and unremarkable. Wan Jin still showed no improvement and repeatedly missed opportunities, which was regrettable.</p>
<p>The Chinese team frequently missed good opportunities. England kicked off but was immediately blocked. Sun Jinshun received the ball and quickly passed it to Ah Dai, who passed it to Wan. Wan raised his foot to shoot, but missed the first scoring opportunity due to insufficient power. Later, Li Yichen and Huang Kehou passed to Wan Jin twice, but Wan missed both times. At that time, the Chinese team's attack was strong. Jia's corner kick was excellent, but it was saved by the opponent. The English team's counterattack was ineffective. China invaded the enemy's territory again. Dai, in the center forward position, shot with his heel, but the ball hit the crossbar and bounced out. In less than a minute, Ah Dai had a chance to shoot but missed wildly. The audience sighed. England launched a full-scale attack, invading the Chinese penalty area. Te Fei was eager to score but shot out of bounds. At that time, China attacked again. Jia Youliang pulled the ball back from eleven meters, but missed wildly again. Soon, Jia got the ball and crossed it in, but Sun headed it out of bounds. At that time, Dai, Sun, and Jia all had scoring opportunities, but they all missed by a hair. In the last two minutes, English player Pei Qian crossed the ball in. Qin Bigao ran out to catch it. Fortunately, Zhuang Youren cleared the danger with a high kick. The first half ended without a result.</p>
<p>Li Yichen scores with one arrow. The teams switched sides. Wan Jin received a pass from Huang Kehou, but failed to score again. Li Yichen intercepted the ball and lightly passed it to Youliang. Jia crossed it in, but there was no one to meet it. Fifteen minutes into the second half, the Chinese team's defense was suddenly in danger. F. Edward dribbled straight in. Han Longhai and Zhuang Youren failed to stop him, and the situation was extremely critical. Fortunately, F. Edward's shot was inaccurate and went wide. The Chinese team turned misfortune into fortune. Huang Kehou passed forward. Li Yichen received the pass from Jia, who passed it to Ah Dai. Ah Dai shot with a diving header, but it went inches wide. More than ten minutes later, Dai's shot hit Mada's arm, resulting in a penalty kick. Li Yichen took the penalty. The audience was overjoyed, but Li kicked powerfully and it was saved by Willie. The English team, having failed to defend, launched an attack. Pei Shi advanced, and Li Ran failed to stop him, resulting in a corner kick. Pei crossed it in brilliantly, but fortunately Han Longhai saved it quickly. In the last four minutes, Dai got the ball and passed it to the right. Jia Youliang passed it brilliantly to the center. Li Yichen slid and shot the ball into the net. Willie was helpless. The fans cheered wildly. China eliminated Scotland 1-0 and qualified for the semi-finals.</p>

The essence of all Chinese basketball teams will be gathered to compete for the championship, speaking up for the general poor. The competition will be unprecedentedly exciting. It is most enjoyable to appreciate the skills and do good deeds. It is a win-win situation. Unfortunately, the Western Youth Association basketball court has limited seats, accommodating only 370 people downstairs and 410 people upstairs each night. No more can be accommodated. Therefore, starting today, tickets will be pre-sold at the Shenbao Newspaper Office on Hankou Road and the Western Youth Association on Jing'an Temple Road. Tickets are 5 yuan downstairs and 3 yuan upstairs. The number of tickets is limited, so it is best to get them early to avoid regrets. According to the Shenbao Cup charity competition, all income, excluding expenses, will be donated equally to three charitable organizations: (1) Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, (2) Shanghai International Red Cross Society, (3) Western Youth Association Christmas Poor Children's Party. Also, the Chinese team held its final practice at the Central Youth Association last night, using Mai Lingbai as an opponent to find the ideal optimal lineup. Therefore, the entire team played in rotation last night, without counting the wins or losses. As a result, Mai Bai won by a score of 24 to 20. In the pre-competition friendly match, Liang Xi defeated Mai Hong by a large margin of 45 to 22, with the first half being 27 to 10.</p>

<p>Everyone in Britain has great determination to face the threat of German invasion. In a matter of weeks, the British Isles have been completely transformed into a vast fortress.</p>
<p>Deep and long trenches crisscross the sandy beaches, open fields, and countryside of Great Britain, forming a terrifying line of defense. Machine guns and foxholes are scattered along the line. Obstacles and gun emplacements are being built everywhere.</p>
<p>In-depth deployment is the backbone of Britain's defense strategy. From the coastline to the interior, winding for countless miles, passing through countless villages, a series of trenches and shelters, bunkers and observation posts. This is the new face of Britain.</p>
<p>In addition to this outer appearance, the fighting spirit of the entire nation is also beating strongly. Workers, armed forces, and auxiliary groups, all with unwavering loyalty, follow the leadership of the wise and broad-minded Prime Minister Churchill, the resourceful Minister of Labor Bevin, and the capable and talented Minister of Aircraft Production Beaverbrook, working together to advance towards the final victory.</p>
<p>The rate of arms production is astonishing. The number of tanks manufactured has more than doubled. The production of Bren gun carriers has increased by 60%. The production of various guns and artillery pieces has increased by 50% to 228%. The production of certain munitions has increased more than fourfold.</p>
<p>Beaverbrook and the workers under him have more than doubled the production of a famous fighter plane in just three weeks. This is almost unbelievable. The production of other types of aircraft has also increased significantly. Factories and arsenals are working day and night to produce the finest equipment, weapons, and aircraft for the military.</p>
<p>Britain's well-trained army is over one million strong. Older men are also being rapidly recruited and trained, with tens of thousands already prepared to join the ranks. Soldiers from the various dominions are also arriving in succession, ready to participate in the Battle of Britain. The infantry, sailors, and airmen from Canada, Australia, and New Zealand are all physically fit, alert, and skilled in combat, worthy of being pillars of the nation.</p>
<p>Behind these troops, there are at least 500,000 local volunteers, mostly veterans. They are collectively known as paratrooper search teams, encompassing a wide range of people. For example, a volunteer team near London includes lawyers, bank managers, publishers, doctors, and journalists. One team includes a veteran who commanded troops in France at the end of the last European war. The situation in other teams is quite similar.</p>
<p>Britain's third line of defense is the strengthening of internal institutions. All kinds of resources on the island are being rapidly developed to meet emergency needs. There are also tens of thousands of men and women serving in the air defense auxiliary teams, and a large number of wartime reserve police officers guarding their posts day and night.</p>
<p>Women's enthusiasm is no less than that of men. Many women drive their own cars and work all day without taking any pay. Some drive ambulances, while others work in shifts at arsenals.</p>
<p>The plan to send children to various dominions and the United States has already been implemented. Tens of thousands of children aged five to sixteen have left the country to seek refuge in safe, friendly nations overseas, and tens of thousands more are preparing to depart.</p>
<p>In addition to land defenses, there is also a naval defense line. The British Navy's control of the seas is the most difficult problem for Hitler. This control of the seas maintains Britain's maritime transportation, allowing thousands of merchant ships to sail day and night, carrying large quantities of food, raw materials, guns, and aircraft to Britain.</p>
<p>Scattered across the globe, in all directions, are the inexhaustible resources of manpower, food, raw materials, and industrial production of the British Empire. Britain knows that this war must rely on the support of all parts of the Empire and the countries of the New World, and it knows that this trust will not be misplaced.</p>
<p>Explanation of Military News Terms</p>
<p>Torpedo: A cigar-shaped, self-propelled explosive projectile launched from submarines, other boats, or torpedo planes. The warhead can contain up to 500 pounds of nitrocellulose, which explodes upon impact. It contains air and fuel that generate internal combustion, converting stored water into steam to power the propellers. Large torpedoes have a diameter of up to 21 inches, and their length is typically 12 times their diameter. They can travel up to four miles at a speed of 36 miles per hour. At shorter distances, the speed is higher. If the speed is reduced, the range can reach up to ten miles.</p>
<p>Torpedo Boat: Various types of boats that launch torpedoes on the surface of the water. Recently, there has been a type of "mosquito" boat that uses its high speed to approach targets, launch torpedoes, and then quickly leave. The smallest type resembles a small motorboat and can carry one or two torpedoes. The highest speed is 40 knots.</p>
<p>Torpedo Plane: An aircraft that launches torpedoes from the air to attack targets at sea. The British Swordfish aircraft belongs to this type.</p>
<p>U-Boat: A German submarine. Originally an abbreviation of Unterseeboot. It sinks by releasing water into the ballast tanks and using rudders. It has gun emplacements on the deck, but its main weapon is the torpedo, which can be launched on the surface or underwater. The latest and best submarines have a displacement of 1,200 to 1,300 tons and can carry a crew of 60. The world's largest submarine is the French "Surcouf," now in British hands, with a displacement of 4,300 tons and a crew of 150. It has two 8-inch caliber guns on the deck, and its watertight compartments can store a small seaplane. The highest speed when submerged is 10 knots. It is powered by a diesel engine on the surface and by electricity underwater.</p>
<p>The Life of a Fetus</p>
<p>A tiny, wriggling drop of semen penetrates a mature ovum, and without awareness, the life of a human being begins. In that instant of fertilization, not only has the existence of a new person been determined, but also its gender and personality.</p>
<p>After the ovum is fertilized, it is immediately stimulated by the penetrating semen, causing great activity, which eventually causes the ovum to divide. One becomes two, two becomes four, and so on, until countless cells that form the entire body have been formed.</p>
<p>At the same time, the uterus builds a fortress-like placenta, which works with the trophoblast to nourish the growing fetus. The mother's blood transports food, oxygen, and water to the placenta, which is then absorbed by the trophoblast and transported to the fetus through the blood vessels of the umbilical cord. The fetus's waste products are also excreted into the placenta, which then transfers them to the mother's blood, which carries them to the kidneys and lungs, and then excretes them out of the body. It is not true that the mother's blood flows through the fetus.</p>
<p>The ovum, fertilized by the semen, turns into a fetus. Within fifteen days, the fetus is a creature that is one-tenth of an inch long, with a head, tail, back, and abdomen, but without arms, legs, face, or neck. However, the heart and brain are already present in their simplest forms.</p>
<p>At the end of the first month, the fetus is one-quarter of an inch long, 50 times larger than it was at fertilization, and 8,000 times heavier. Within these thirty days, the fetus has transformed from a tiny, circular ovum into a creature with a head, body, and tail; a beating heart and circulating blood; and the beginnings of arms and legs, ears, stomach, and brain.</p>
<p>By the end of the second month, the fetus can be said to have evolved from a tadpole to a human being. Its length has increased sixfold (about one and a half inches), and its weight has increased 500 times. Bones and muscles, surrounding the outline of the body, are also developing between the skin and internal organs.</p>
<p>The oral cavity divides into upper and lower jaws, and the area gradually decreases as the cheeks form. The fluid sacs gradually close together until they form a large nose. The eyes, initially located on either side of the head, now move to the front of the head. By the last week of the second month, the eyelids have also appeared. The forehead is raised and prominent. The brain occupies most of the head.</p>
<p>The limbs also undergo the same amazing development. The "limb buds" extend. The limb ends flatten, resembling paddles, forming the root of fingers or toes. Five parallel elevations are separated by shallow grooves between each one; these grooves gradually cut open, and the five fingers and toes separate from each other. Transverse contractions form the wrist, elbow, knee, and ankle within the limbs.</p>
<p>Parallel to the development of muscles is the development of bones. The development of bones also begins with translucent, cartilaginous soft tissue. Hard bone tissue gradually permeates the inner and outer layers of the cartilaginous bone.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most flavorful characteristic of the first month is the development of the sexual organs. At the beginning of the second month, it is not easy to distinguish between the sexes. By the end of the month, the distinction between the sexes can be recognized from the internal and external sexual organs, and even the mammary glands of both sexes begin to develop.</p>
<p>The second month can be called the "tooth month" because there are already twenty "tooth buds" at this time. Within the hard alveolar bone, the dentin has already appeared.</p>
<p>The vocal cords have also appeared, but the vocalization is still incomplete.</p>
<p>The digestive system begins to show signs of activity. The cells lining the stomach have begun to secrete mucus. The liver has also begun to secrete bile into the intestines. The kidneys are also working, secreting urine, which is discharged from the fetus's bladder into the amniotic fluid; the fetus's feces are still passed through the placenta to the mother's blood.</p>
<p>Due to the development of bones and muscles, the fetus's state, outline, and physical strength are all determined. As for the face, the jawbone, cheekbone, and nasal bone, which are still developing, begin to provide a human-like outline, and also cast a thin face for the fetus.</p>
<p>The fetus is indeed a living human body, and this is no longer a question.</p>
<p>From the third to the fourth month, the fetus grows to six to eight inches long, which is equal to one-half of its length at birth. The growth rate slows down afterwards.</p>
<p>The fetus's head occupies almost one-half of the entire body in the first two months; from the third to the fifth month, it occupies one-third; and at birth, it occupies one-quarter.</p>
<p>In the fourth month, the fetus's head is slightly raised, and the spine should be straight. It has a wide face and large eyes. The arms and legs are of moderate length. The fingers and toes are quite wide and are often bent. The skin patterns on the fingertips and toes have already imprinted whorls.</p>
<p>The skin is dark red and wrinkled. The fetus's body lacks fat until the sixth month.</p>
<p>During this period, the fetus is rushing around, stretching its arms and legs, which is called fetal movement.</p>
<p>Around the fifth month, the sebaceous glands secrete fatty fluid, covering the entire body with a cheese-like paste, preventing the amniotic fluid containing waste products from eroding the fetus's delicate skin.</p>
<p>At this time, the entire scalp is covered with shiny hair. Fingernails and toenails have also appeared. The developing deciduous teeth are covered with enamel.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy development this month is that the spine straightens.</p>
<p>A five-month-old fetus is one foot long and weighs one pound. If it is miscarried, it may survive for a few minutes, breathing slightly or crying a few times, but then it will die prematurely.</p>
<p>The fetus's eyelids are always closed in the first three months, and they open in the sixth month. The development of eyelashes and eyebrows usually occurs in the sixth or seventh month.</p>
<p>A six-month-old fetus, if born, will breathe, cry, and wriggle, and may survive for a few hours. A seven-month-old premature fetus, if not difficult to deliver, can often be raised.</p>
<p>In the third month, the specific parts and structures of the brain have already been formed, and by the seventh month, the fetus's nervous system can function.</p>
<p>A seven-month-old fetus is sixteen inches long and weighs three pounds. As soon as it is born, it will cry, eat, breathe, and perhaps distinguish light.</p>
<p>At this time, fat quickly spreads throughout the body, making the skin smooth. The fetus's skin color is very thin, so it is extremely difficult to recognize which race it belongs to at birth. The eyes of babies are mostly blue-gray at birth.</p>
<p>At this time, the fetus is not still; its arms and legs are constantly fidgeting.</p>
<p>Ten percent of fetuses are born on the 280th day, and 75 percent are born within two weeks before the 280th day.</p>
<p>After the fetus is born, the umbilical cord and placenta have not yet separated, and they must be cut.</p>
<p>From conception to birth, all of this involves nine months of twists and turns.</p>
<p>Weekly Supplement "Issue 67" (The image below shows Australian camel soldiers) Military Spending</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch, the cost of this European war has increased from £9 million per day to £16 million per day for Britain. As for Germany, according to the New York Times, it is about 5 billion marks per month (i.e., more than 166.6 million marks per day), of which 2 billion marks are from taxes, and the remaining 3 billion marks are taken from borrowing and plundering in occupied areas. The total amount of German government debt has long exceeded 100 billion marks, or is about to reach 150 billion marks—this huge debt is equal to the amount that bankrupted the mark at the end of the last four-year war of the German Empire.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Grain: Rumors of Saigon Expanding Its Embargo Still Circulate in the Rice Market, Rice Prices Soar to the Maximum Limit Again; It is Unknown Which is True, What Was Stated by the Municipal Council or the Rice Merchants <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Since the spokesperson of the Municipal Council and the Chairman of the Food Committee of the French Municipal Council both denied the Saigon rice embargo, unexpectedly yesterday, the rumors in the rice market became even stranger, saying that Saigon not only embargoed No. 1 rice but has now expanded the embargo to No. 2 rice. In this case, what the Municipal Council and the rice merchants said, which is true and which is false, must be clarified. If there is indeed no embargo in Saigon, then the two concessions should not remain silent about the rice merchants who publicly spread rumors that are detrimental to the people's food and deliberately disrupt the statements made by the responsible persons of the two concessions. Yesterday, for this reason, speculators became more excited. Although speculative households were curbed by fixed deposits and deadlines for delivery, powerful major players could indulge in active trading. At the same time, sellers seized this good opportunity and raised prices from the sidelines. Once there were inquiries, bids rose one after another. The market sentiment soared all the way until the prices of No. 1 and No. 2 Saigon rice in the central market reached the maximum limit. At this point, with no room for further price increases, the prices wavered slightly, fell by half a yuan, and then suddenly returned to the top. This happened repeatedly until the market closed. All prices remained at the limit. No. 1 Saigon was priced at 87 yuan to 86.40 yuan, No. 2 at 81.50 yuan to 80 yuan, special quality fire-milled rice at 86 yuan to 82 yuan, No. 2 Siamese rice at 79 yuan to 78 yuan, small quality fire-milled rice at 78 yuan to 77 yuan, broken rice at 75 yuan to 74.80 yuan, shattered rice at 72.50 yuan to 70 yuan, Tokyo top quality rice at 71.50 yuan, and Wuhu top quality rice at 76 yuan, about 1.5 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous market. Futures prices rose by two to three yuan. Recovered original bags of No. 2 rice reached 95.50 yuan for immediate delivery and 93 yuan for December delivery, with plans to continue raising prices. The total daily transaction of ready cash foreign rice reached 14,500 bags, and original bags also amounted to more than 700 tons.</p>
<p>Yesterday, more foreign rice arrived in Shanghai on the Jardine Matheson's "Ewo" ship, carrying 1,683 bags from Hong Kong. It arrived at the port yesterday morning and docked at the Roosevelt Wharf for unloading. Also, the Taikoo Dockyard's "Anqing" ship had foreign rice loaded, arriving in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM and docking at the company's wharf in Pudong. Because it was Saturday afternoon and the office was closed, the exact amount of foreign rice loaded is unknown and will be reported next Monday. [Translator's note]</p>
<p>Domestic rice of thick and thin Japonica varieties is difficult to obtain, and arrivals are still limited. Therefore, foreign rice prices have been soaring repeatedly. With brisk sales, sellers are firm. However, prices are already high, making it difficult to raise them sharply. As a result, prices rose by about one yuan. For Kunshan rice sold by the "hu" unit, top-quality Japonica rice was priced at 98 yuan, 94 yuan, and special grade at 100 yuan. Thin Japonica rice was priced at 87-88 yuan.</p>
<p>Although the demand for glutinous rice was also quite smooth yesterday, new domestic glutinous rice from Danyang and other places has already entered the market, with a quantity of about one thousand bags. Prices for both domestic and foreign glutinous rice remained stable, with Yixing Chen Bai rice priced at 92-93 yuan and Danyang new white rice at 88 yuan. Hong Kong white rice ranged from 83.50 yuan to 80 yuan.</p>
<p>Sudden Surge in Foreign Flour Prices</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the spot and futures market for foreign flour experienced a sudden surge in prices. The inventory of No. 2 flour mills has been stagnant for a long time. Except for the 6,000 bags allocated for actual sales in this street, there are no remaining bags for sale. Australian foreign flour, which sells well in the market, is in great demand in this street. Due to the premium on foreign currency, the reduction in exchange rates, and the rising rice prices, many speculators are stocking up. The price of spot Australian foreign flour rose to 20 yuan, and incoming shipments were priced at 19.90 yuan, with the prospect of reaching 20 yuan. A total of over 6,000 bags were traded. It is heard that incoming shipments will continue to arrive soon, with one or two ships expected to arrive within days. With expectations of higher prices, although the market has not been excessively inflated, it is not easy to suppress.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's transactions were mostly scattered. Except for the Japanese factories, which slightly increased their purchases for delivery, there were few new whole-ticket transactions. It is heard that the Japanese factories have recently purchased a batch of futures wheat, but there is no enthusiastic trading intention. Because rice and flour prices are both firm and high, those holding wheat are trying to raise prices, so trading in the market has also become sparse.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Oil Market: Soybean Oil Continues to be Sold Off; Distant Futures Oil Acts Like a Soccer Ball <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot sales in the oil market were still normal (200 pieces of Jiaozhou Xinsheng Oil were delivered at 84 yuan, and 100 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil were delivered at 84.50 yuan). Therefore, there were no new developments in the overall situation. However, futures trading was quite tortuous due to the lively trend of speculative buying and selling throughout the day. Dalian soybean oil was sold off by the Adjustment Company, with more than 2,000 barrels of December futures delivered, "with a 10% deposit," priced at 106 yuan. The market for Qingdao crude oil, with over 800 barrels of December futures delivered, was weak due to most transactions being profit-taking. As a result, the price fell by one yuan compared to the previous market, from 113.75 yuan to 112.50 yuan. Over 500 barrels of February futures were contracted. This kind of distant futures "soccer ball" trading was quite turbulent. Although there were no significant increases or decreases, the price fluctuated by more than one yuan throughout the day. The opening price was 112.50 yuan, and the closing price was 112 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Shanghai Flour Market in Turmoil <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xiqing</p>
<p>Currently, there are seven flour mills operating in the Shanghai concessions: Fuxin Nos. 2, 7, and 8, Fufeng's old and new mills, and Xinda Huafeng, among others. In terms of production capacity, the above seven mills could originally produce more than 78,000 bags of flour per day and night, but recently, due to the shortage of raw materials, they cannot reach the expected amount. In 1938 and 1939, there were no obstacles to transporting wheat from various wheat-producing areas in the interior to the Shanghai concessions. Therefore, the above mills could continue to operate and maintain food supplies for both local and foreign populations. However, since the new wheat harvest this year, sources have been "controlled," resulting in a significant reduction in flour production. Flour mills have had to purchase foreign wheat. However, the base price of foreign wheat is in foreign currency, and with the tightening of foreign exchange, wheat prices have become expensive. In addition, the various expenses of the flour mills have increased cumulatively, so the price of flour has gradually risen to the nominal factory price of 18 yuan per bag. Some flour mills have reduced production or suspended operations due to raw material issues. It is estimated that the daily production is only between 9,000 and 10,000 bags. In January of this year, the flour mills, following the suggestion of the Municipal Council, sold flour at a fixed price for one month (10 yuan per bag plus a handling fee of 0.30 yuan), with the Fuxin and Fufeng flour mills supplying 7,500 bags per day, which was widely praised. In June, a shortage of flour occurred again, and the Municipal Council tried to regulate the price (fixed at 13.80 yuan per bag, including handling fees), which was fortunately resolved. By late September, flour produced by mills in the occupied areas of the interior and suburban Shanghai was suddenly prohibited from being transported into the concessions. Even flour already stored in warehouses in the Hongkou district could not be transported into the concessions. As a result, people were alarmed, believing that flour mills within the concessions had limited raw materials and insufficient production, and that the city's flour supply would be cut off. Therefore, the market became brisk with buying. At this time, foreign wheat quotations rose sharply, and foreign exchange became tight, so flour prices soared. However, both industry insiders and outsiders believed that prices would rise further and hoarded flour instead of selling it. It is estimated that there are more than 1,500 Shanghai pancake, fried dough stick, and pan-fried bun stalls, more than 400 noodle shops, and more than 50 bakeries, totaling more than 2,400 establishments. If each establishment needs an average of three bags of flour, then they would need a total of 7,200 bags. There are also biscuit factories, confectionery stores, noodle snack shops, condiment factories, yarn mills, and household consumption, the amount of which is not included. Therefore, the 9,000 bags or so of flour produced daily by flour mills are used to supply various sectors on the "isolated island." If there were no hoarding, supply and demand could be balanced. However, merchants are driven by habit and greed. Even with the current flour price of 18 yuan per bag, the black market price has actually reached over 20 yuan, causing market sentiment to fluctuate. The Municipal Council, recognizing this, stepped in again in late September to regulate prices (fixed at 16.80 yuan per bag, including handling fees). Those who need flour, such as pancake, bread, and noodle businesses, can purchase directly from the flour wholesalers after being approved, which avoids the additional costs charged by flour retailers, thus gradually stabilizing the flour market.</p>
<p>During the flour market tension, Shanghai stores and firms placed large orders for foreign flour from Australia (1.5 million bags), with the lowest price being 16 yuan or so per bag upon arrival in Shanghai. The flour is now arriving in Shanghai one after another. Logically, with the supply of flour replenished, prices should be stable, but in reality, the opposite has happened. The raw materials for Chinese flour mills in the Shanghai concession area no longer have abundant reserves. It is estimated that, at the current production rate, they can maintain operations for a maximum of three months. Some flour mills only have enough wheat for about a month. In the first half of the year, the so-called miscellaneous brands of flour from mills in the occupied areas of the interior were continuously transported and sold, which was able to make up for a portion of the flour sales in Shanghai. Now, the local flour production is difficult to sustain, and there has been no news of large orders for foreign wheat being placed. Flour from the interior has been prohibited from being transported in (a small amount is transported from Nanxiang to Zhabei by free cars, but the amount is minimal). Rice prices are rising steadily, and the sales of flour and wheat are brisk, so the flour market is not softening even with the large amount of foreign flour already ordered. After the recent surge in rice prices, speculators, realizing that the cost of hoarding rice is too high, or that they have already made a profit from hoarding rice, are turning their attention to hoarding flour. However, the amount of locally produced flour is extremely small, and the black market price of flour from the local Mountain Car brand mills has been raised to 20.05 yuan per bag (the mill price is 18 yuan). As a result, the foreign flour arriving in Shanghai (300,000 bags) has become the sole target of speculators. The price has risen from around 19 yuan to over 20 yuan. However, according to the actual situation, warehouses hold less than one million bags of flour, and a large batch of foreign flour is coming one after another, so there is no reason to cause a flour panic. However, there is a large amount of hot money on the "isolated island," and there are few opportunities for speculation in foreign exchange, gold, yarn, and stocks, so they choose rice, flour, coal, and other essential daily necessities to manipulate, reaping profits as easily as taking something out of a pocket.</p>
<p>Assuming that there are 1 million bags of flour in storage in Shanghai and 1 million bags of foreign flour arriving one after another, totaling 2 million bags, and assuming that Shanghai consumes a total of 8,000 bags per day, then it can last for more than eight months. In fact, local mills are still producing flour, and various sectors have already purchased and stored a considerable amount of flour, so the rise in flour prices is not actually caused by an imbalance between arrivals and sales. In my humble opinion, the raw materials for flour mills are "controlled," so in addition to the authorities finding ways to facilitate the transportation of wheat from the interior to Shanghai (which they have expressed an intention to do, but have not yet realized), the flour mills should be assisted in placing orders for foreign wheat in batches. If the price of foreign wheat is expensive and the price of flour is high, making it difficult to sell, the profit margin should be balanced and the flour should be sold smoothly, allowing it to be supplied to the market steadily. Because the price of foreign flour arriving in Shanghai is cheaper than that of local flour, local flour will inevitably have a smaller sales market at that time, so it is necessary to rely on the authorities to protect it. (It would be more cost-effective for us to purchase foreign wheat rather than foreign flour, because the profits from producing flour with foreign wheat, and the employment of workers, would be beneficial to the country. If foreign flour comes to China, the Chinese would only be able to sell it for profit, while everything else would be in the hands of foreigners.) However, I am not opposed to not ordering foreign flour. In fact, it is best to proceed on both fronts and replenish the flour supply in Shanghai. For flour buyers, in addition to applying to various industries, attention should be paid to investigating their usage to avoid hoarding and facilitate the circulation of goods and maintain normal supply and demand.</p>
<p>Currently, the mill price of flour in Shanghai is 18 yuan, but the black market price is over 20 yuan per bag, a difference of more than 2 yuan per bag. Therefore, some buyers of fixed-price flour (the fixed-price flour program currently organized by the Municipal Council, at 18.30 yuan per bag including handling fees, is still ongoing) sell the flour for over 18 yuan in one turn, making a profit of 2 yuan per bag, which is even more profitable than selling various food products made with flour, and it is more convenient and simple. It is believed that there are many such troublemakers. This is completely contrary to the original intention of the authorities to balance market prices and regulate the people's food supply. If everyone follows suit, the production of proper flour products will decrease, causing good flour to be hoarded and stored, eventually leading to goods being stored in warehouses and less circulation in the market, causing market prices to rise steadily, which is frightening. Therefore, I believe that the authorities should instruct the representatives who receive fixed-price flour to investigate daily whether the flour received by each household has been completely used up or whether there is any remaining (of course, it cannot be exact, but it should be reasonably close). If anyone is found to be over-reporting the amount of flour received and selling it privately, the representatives should report it immediately. If they fail to report it and it is verified by someone else, the household's right to receive flour should be cancelled immediately, and the fixed-price flour received daily in the past should be recovered (this recovered flour can be resold to other households in need). The representative who neglected their duty should also be suspended from receiving flour for one day as a warning against negligence. On the one hand, the total amount of flour stored in warehouses throughout the city, the daily sales volume in local and foreign areas, the daily production of flour mills, and the amount of foreign flour arriving at the port should be investigated. By combining information from all sources and adapting to environmental conditions, a fair flour price can be determined, with a period of three days or one week. Black market prices should be vigorously cracked down on. If this can be done, the Shanghai flour market in turmoil may be slightly calmed down.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Finance: Foreign Exchange Speculation; Demand Increases <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: the HSBC official exchange rate showed no change. The black market exchange rates for British pounds and US dollars remained tight, mainly because speculative demand increased. In addition, many foreign banks had a strong appetite. Although HSBC and China Bank, etc., supplied sufficiently, there was still a shortage of funds. The US dollar once reached 5.84375 yuan. However, by noon, the market calmed down. The price of British pounds was 3/7/1875, and the US dollar was 5.875 yuan. In the afternoon, there was no market due to Saturday. Compared to the previous day, both British pounds and US dollars were down by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively.</p>
<p>Both spot and futures were tight</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London spot price fell by 0.0625, and the long-term price was stable. Also, according to the New York telegram, the price of US bank notes remained unchanged, the price of London raw gold remained unchanged, the exchange rate of British pounds against US dollars and Shanghai was stable, the exchange rate of US dollars against British pounds did not change, and the exchange rate against Shanghai was slightly lower by 0.03. There was no market for the French franc. The exchange rates announced by the Central Bank remained the same. At the opening of the morning, the spot selling price of banks was 3/7/1875 for British pounds and 5.875 yuan for US dollars, which was tighter by 0.015625 and softer by 0.0335 compared to the previous day's closing. After the opening, speculators immediately scrambled. China Bank and Overseas Chinese Bank sold, and HSBC was willing to sell. The market was initially flat and then strengthened. US dollar speculation by merchants in the current month entered HSBC at 5.875 yuan, and soon rebounded to 5.90625 yuan. The HSBC official rate was announced unchanged. The silver balance tax was announced to be down 0.25%. Afterwards, China Bank sold shillings to HSBC for the current month, still at 3/7/1875. However, other foreign banks, such as Chase, Mercantile, and Chartered, had a strong appetite, and the underlying trend softened again. China Bank and HSBC sold US dollars to them for the current month at 5.875 yuan, once reaching 5.84375 yuan. By noon, the situation was still stable. As a result, at the closing, the spot and current month prices were 3/7/875 for British pounds and 5.875 yuan for US dollars. The price for British pounds in the next month was 3/7/03125, and the price for US dollars was 5.84375, tighter by 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively compared to the near-term price on the previous day. In the afternoon, there was no market due to Saturday.</p>

<p>Hong Kong, 14th (Saturday) dispatch: The exchange market opened flat this morning.

<h3 id="e87">After the Swap Trade, Cash Prices Rose Again; Buyers Paid a Premium of 40 Yuan <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market gold price: As the third-term cash futures transaction turned into the fourth-term, the buyer still paid a premium and the seller received a discount. Because the future contract has been extended to a one-month term, the discount relationship with the one-month interest rate after the multi-party receives the goods is higher than the previous two contracts. At 7:45 AM, brokers had already started pre-trading. Buyers initially called for a discount of 25 yuan. Soon, a major player paid a gold merchant a discount of 28 yuan for 150 taels. Silver firms and certain gold merchants rushed to pay a premium, and the price gradually increased. At 8:15 AM, when the official rate was posted, it had risen to 40 yuan for the buyer to pay the seller. Later, it rose further. The highest discount a gold merchant paid to a silver firm was 45 yuan for 10 taels, and when money changers and others came to collect the premium, it fell back slightly, eventually settling at around 40 yuan. At 9:00 AM, the fourth-term cash futures transaction opened, with a stable and firm underlying trend. After the swap trade, the market was inevitably bullish. Therefore, it opened at 5,850 yuan. Later, although HSBC supplied foreign exchange, speculators and other foreign banks had an appetite for it, so after several returns to equilibrium, the market tightened again. The price also fell back to 5,832 yuan. Under the buying pressure of the bill merchants, it rose to 5,865 yuan, eventually settling at 5,853 yuan, a rise of 52 yuan (excluding the swap trade of 40 yuan, a rise of 13 yuan). More than 4,000 taels were traded in the morning. There were few cash transactions, and the price was 40 yuan lower than the futures price. There was no afternoon market on Saturday. Jewelry gold rose by 10 yuan to 600 yuan.</p>
<p>Black Market Price Fell by More Than 50 Yuan</p>
<p>The market was surprisingly bullish in the early morning. Buying was prevalent on the trading floor. Gold merchants raised prices sharply at the opening, offering 5,850 yuan for 20 taels to silver firms. It was also heard that foreign exchange opened tighter, and sellers raised prices without moving. Dongzheng Securities offered 5,860 yuan for 20 taels to silver firms, a premium of 10 yuan. Later, as the market gradually recovered, securities firms and gold merchants immediately sold, slightly lowering the price. Gold merchants offered 5,832 yuan for 20 taels to silver firms. After 11:00 AM, the bill market softened again, and silver firms stirred up buying, rising again to 5,865 yuan. Silver firms bought 30 taels from gold merchants. Until the afternoon, the underlying trend remained firm. Gold merchants offered 5,853 yuan for 20 taels to silver firms. There was no afternoon market on Saturday, and the price rose by 53 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 35 yuan in half a day. The selling price of the cash gold of the card number firm was more than 10 yuan higher than the black market price. The purchase price was 30 yuan lower. The current premium gold was 50-60 yuan lower than the official gold price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Previous Jewelry Gold was Suspended at 600 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was raised by 10 yuan. Datong Bank changed the price to 600 yuan. The new banks charged a similar price, and the purchase price was reduced by about 30 yuan.</p>
<p>US Dollar Notes Approach the 17 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market: The black market price continued to rise, and the price of British pounds and US dollars also continued to rise by one yuan. The British pound notes remained stable, and the US dollar notes were about to hit the 17 yuan mark. They initially rose to 16.98 yuan, then fell back to 16.88 yuan, and finally rose again to 16.95 yuan, a final increase of 0.07 yuan compared to the previous day. The demand for Hong Kong notes was not weak, and the evening market price rose to 4.05 yuan. The Japanese yen notes continued to soften, with the evening market price at 1.57 yuan. The Korean notes continued to rise, with the market price reaching 1.35 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Securities: Stagnant Bond Market <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>The black market for public bonds was even quieter yesterday. There were only a few transactions, and the number of people attending the meeting decreased day by day, as if they had lost interest. Because the multiple parties bore too much interest, they gradually showed signs of shaking. The future market price will not fall or rise again. The stagnant situation cannot be broken without stimulation. Yesterday's transactions were mostly selling by Defu, amounting to one to two hundred thousand. The selling by Xinfu, Hu Heji, and Shuntai was also limited. However, Renchang, Xieda, and Shengda were not enthusiastic about buying. As a result, the consistent return was small, with only about 0.1 yuan fluctuation. The transaction volume was only about 500,000 yuan. There were no transactions for 96 bonds. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 200 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were traded at 8.3 yuan, 1.3 yuan higher than the previous price.</p>
<p>London, 13th (Friday) dispatch: The listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and Far East British companies' stocks remained flat today. Only the price of Mercantile Bank shares continued to rise by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 8 pounds, 2 shillings, and 6 pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Yarn and Cotton: Hong Kong Sales Revive; Yarn Prices Continue to Rise; Shuang Ma Rises Another 30 Yuan <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the rising trend was still strong. This was because the demand from Hong Kong has clearly improved, so the market is becoming more bullish. Short sellers, seeing the improved environment, had to painfully cover their positions. At the same time, a certain long position not only did not intend to sell but instead dragged in more positions, so the market trend continued to advance to a higher peak. Customer sales totaled 1,630 bales. The market sentiment remained bullish in the afternoon, and buyers were willing to buy at 1,325 yuan.</p>
<p>Shuang Ma unfolded. Because the market sentiment was firm and bullish in the afternoon of the previous day, the opening price continued to advance. The opening price was 1,310 yuan, rising slightly to 1,311 yuan. At this time, long positions took some profit, falling back to 1,304 yuan. However, a certain source still dragged in according to the market, and the chips became tight for a time. The market price rose again to 1,312 yuan. A batch of scattered long positions that made a profit in the middle were released, suddenly falling to 1,303 yuan. The low price attracted buyers like a swarm of bees. Then it was heard that foreign exchange was tightening, and the market sentiment was turbulent with buying. At the same time, the actual sales of the Hong Kong gang developed considerably, purchasing more than 1,000 bales. The buying momentum was stronger, rising directly to 1,324 yuan at the close. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 5,932 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma rose by 30 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchases is shown separately on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Cotton Market Also Tends to be Firm and Stable <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still firm. This is because the yarn price is rising, which has brought about a slight improvement in the cotton market. However, the manufacturers' purchases are not as strong as they were on the previous day. The market price is as stable as ever. The cotton market is also in a stable state.</p>
<p>In other news, the foreign cotton market price: The New York cotton market was active again. First, it was because of the continued purchases by spot merchants, and then it was because of the buying by fellow traders. As a result, the closing price was 5-6 pounds higher than the previous day. India fell by 2 rupees yesterday, including forecasts.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: The price of cotton yarn has been high in recent days, but the price of cotton has not improved. The inventory in the market is thin, and the dangers on the way are increasing. However, the cotton price cannot be stimulated. The main reason is that the factories are not purchasing. However, it is generally expected that there will be a turnaround within days.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Piece Goods Cotton Cloth Outward Transportation Still Difficult <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market trend was firm, with rising prices and active trading intentions. Despite tireless efforts to absorb the market, actual sales remained sluggish due to difficulties in outward transportation and ample stock preparations. The selling price of some coarse and fine twill fabrics continued to rise by about 2.5 jiao per piece, while the price of some bleached and dyed fabrics also rose by 2 to 3 jiao. Flannel prices remained stable due to limited sales orders. Transactions of various goods on this street amounted to 1,500 to 1,600 pieces, with over 100 pieces of fine cloth and colored cloth handled by Ningbo and Wenzhou merchants from the Zhejiang route, over 300 pieces of pongee, colored cloth, coarse cloth, and twill handled by merchants from Quanzhou, and over 100 pieces of coarse cloth, silk, and blue cloth handled by merchants from Tianjin on the northern route.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The selling prices of Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi drill remained unchanged, while the demand for medium- and low-grade miscellaneous fine cloths continued to increase, leading to further price increases. Twelve-pound Flying Fish fine cloth opened at 36 yuan in the morning, and later transactions among dealers reached 36.25 yuan, driving up the prices of other brands as well.</p>

<p>— Dong Sheng</p>
<p>Children, are you happy? Because a person with nothing to do will hardly be happy. Adults have a saying called "idle worries." When people are "idle," they become "worried." However, you may not fully understand the meaning of these two words. Please allow me to explain it. Right? When you are alone in a corner, doing nothing, staring blankly with your two eyes, are you happy? Tell me! So you must have something to do.</p>
<p>However, how many people in this world are born with something to do? And how many people are born able to do things? This entirely depends on the "education" adults give you. Didn't the deceased "Mr. Lu Xun" say that if you give them a lion-tiger style education, they will be able to use their claws and teeth; if you give them an ox-sheep style education, they will still use a pair of pitiful horns in times of extreme danger. "Education" is very important. In fact, the most important thing is your own "learning." "Learning" is a human "instinct." Think about it carefully. Didn't you "learn" your words from adults? Didn't you learn to use chopsticks by watching others? These are all "learning" to do things. A person must "learn."</p>
<p>How to "learn"? First, you must have a "spirit of learning." What is the "spirit of learning"? It is "courage," "perseverance," and "persistence." Because with "courage," you will not be afraid of difficulties; with "perseverance," you will be determined to do things; and with "persistence," you will continue to work diligently. In this way, you will "learn" many things, and therefore, you will have many things to do, and therefore, you will have many things to do!</p>
<p>Have you read the newspapers? A few days ago, the "China-America Daily" had a news item saying that Mr. Shen Junru was learning Russian in Chongqing, "learning" all day long, whether running or taking a car. You know, Mr. Shen is already sixty years old. Think about it, if a sixty-year-old is still like this, shouldn't you, children, have a "spirit of learning"?</p>
<h3 id="e93">"Hitting Water Chestnuts" <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>In late autumn and early winter, it is the season for children to "hit water chestnuts." Children in any alley always like to gather tightly together, drawing a circle on the smooth cement floor, putting a "chicken" in the center, and the children around hitting the "water chestnuts" accurately at the "chicken," constantly shouting, "How fresh!" However, a deep dent has been left on the "chicken." Although they shout "fresh," they don't actually eat the chicken. This is actually the children playing the game of "hitting water chestnuts." The "chicken" is the slang term for "water chestnuts."</p>
<p>A'hui Liu's interest in this game of "hitting water chestnuts" was aroused by the neighboring children's love for it. He spent about two jiao to buy a "water chestnut," asked his family for some rope, and joined the group of "hitting water chestnuts." At first, his skills were not very good, so the new "water chestnut" was unfortunately trapped in the circle, and the children with superb skills hit the new "water chestnut" many times, leaving many marks. At this time, his heart felt as if pierced by a knife, extremely frustrated. The other children shouted, "Quickly 'eat the fresh chicken'!" and their faces showed a very proud expression, as if they had really eaten a "fresh chicken." With great difficulty, the neighboring child saved him, but he had been trapped for a quarter of an hour. It turned out that the children "hitting water chestnuts" also had their secret organization, forming "parties" of three or five. If a child in their own "party's" "water chestnut" was "killed," they would rush to save it, never saving the "water chestnuts" of children from other "parties" first. The leader of the "party" was the child with the best skills, and also older, with considerable influence in an alley, a small tycoon. Some children who knew how to "flatter" joined his ranks, willingly submitting, so they could take some advantage when "hitting water chestnuts," not being trapped in "long-term prison." A'hui, with little influence and no "party" organization, was always trapped in the circle when he joined the "hitting water chestnuts" group, never hoping to be rescued. When his own "water chestnut" was hit far away by others, he had to run over dejectedly to pick it up and put it back in the circle. The other children ridiculed, "This rickshaw pulls very far," "This yellow dog is very good at picking up bones." These kinds of taunts, sentence by sentence, pierced his heart, and adding the dents on the "water chestnut" further increased his frustration. However, after a week, A'hui's skills in "hitting water chestnuts" improved very quickly, and he understood all the inside stories. Who were his friends, who were his enemies, he had distinguished them clearly, ready to repay those who deserved it and take revenge on those who deserved it.</p>
<p>One afternoon, A'hui was playing happily, wanting to save the "water chestnut" of a neighboring child, and forcefully hit the "water chestnut" down. Who knew that at this time, a child happened to be squatting on the ground picking up "water chestnuts," so A'hui's "water chestnut" kissed the back of that child's hand. However, due to excessive force and the small iron nail on the foot of the "water chestnut," the child's hand suddenly bled, causing a mess. He quickly accompanied the child back to his home, receiving a scolding from the child's mother, and his heart kept pounding. He watched the many scars engraved on his own "water chestnut," and recalled the taunts that pierced his heart, the distorted faces of the children, and the blood of that child stained on the foot of the "water chestnut," and resentfully threw the "water chestnut" to who knows where; and made a vow, never to do this nearly indecent game again!</p>

<p>— Lide Elementary School Ren Deyi One Day's Diary</p>
<p>July 25th, Thursday, sunny. I got up early in the morning, and the sun was already shining brightly on the window. I knew it would be very hot today, so I went to check the temperature on the thermometer. Ah! It was already 88 degrees Fahrenheit. After eating breakfast and reading a few English lessons, I was sweating profusely. After resting for a while, I sat by the window and quietly wrote a page of characters, and I was still sweating, soaking half of my shirt.</p>
<p>After eating lunch, it was even hotter than in the morning. I went to check the thermometer again, and it had already risen to 96 degrees. I said to my mother, "It's very hot today, I want to buy watermelon to eat." She said, "Watermelons are so expensive this year, how can we buy them?" In Yixing, not to mention one, I used to buy dozens at a time, eating several loads in one summer. But what about my hometown now? What about our houses? Alas! Whose suffering is this? Go take a nap! This apple, eat it when you wake up."</p>
<p>I took the apple and went to sleep. Unknowingly, my mother and I took a car to Yixing. When we reached the city gate, we saw two soldiers guarding the city, dozing off. We took this opportunity and walked in. Before long, I saw my own home, still very good, not burned down, and there were many watermelons hidden. I picked up the biggest one, held it in my hand, and laughed loudly, saying, "I can eat as much watermelon as I want now." I woke up with a laugh, and it turned out I was holding an apple, not a watermelon.</p>
<h3 id="e95">A Question <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Danny</p>
<p>Children, today is Sunday, you don't go to school, may I ask you a question? Suppose there is a glass tank filled with water and ice, and the water level is flush with the edge of the tank. The ice cubes are very large, floating on the water, with many parts extending out of the tank. Then, when the weather gets hot and all the ice melts into water, will the water overflow? Children, think about it first, and don't rush to read the explanation below.</p>
<p>Careless people might think: since the water has already filled the tank, and a lot of ice is floating on the surface, then once all the ice melts, the tank will not be able to hold it, and the water will definitely overflow. But the fact is not so. To understand this principle, you must first understand two things.</p>
<p>First: Everything expands when heated and contracts when cooled, but water is somewhat different. As the temperature gradually decreases, the water naturally gradually shrinks, but when it drops to 4 degrees Celsius, it shrinks to the smallest extent. If the temperature is lowered further, it not only does not shrink, but expands instead, until it reaches zero degrees, when it begins to freeze into ice; during freezing, it expands greatly, so the density of ice is less than that of water. In other words, for the same weight of water and ice, the volume of ice is greater than that of water. When water freezes into ice, its volume increases greatly.</p>
<p>Second: Any object placed in a fluid, for the sake of clarity, let's say placed in water, is subject to the buoyancy of the water. The magnitude of the buoyancy is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the object. This is called Archimedes' principle, because it was discovered by Archimedes, a great Greek mathematician. Therefore, when the weight of an object is greater than the buoyancy, the object sinks; when the buoyancy of the water is equal to the weight of the object, the object floats on the water.</p>
<p>Now that the ice is floating on the water, the weight of the ice is equal to the buoyancy of the water; that is to say, the weight of the ice is equal to the weight of the water displaced by the part of the ice submerged in the water. Because the volume of ice is greater than that of water, it floats above the water surface. When it melts into water, the volume shrinks, exactly filling the space previously occupied by the part of the ice submerged in the water. It can still be contained in the tank and will not overflow.</p>

<p>— Wang Xiaoping</p>
<p>One day, a little fly hid on the horn of a bull. It thought the bull would feel tired because of its weight. So it said, "If you think I'm too heavy, please be honest, then I can fly away immediately."</p>
<p>The bull replied, "I don't even know where you're hiding. If you fly away, I certainly won't notice that you've already flown away, so how can you use your weight to make me tired?"</p>
<p>Arrogant people always think that they are noticed by many people in the world, but they don't know that others are not paying attention to them!</p>

<h3 id="e97">The Life of Beethoven, the Sage of Music <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>— Bitter Plum</p>
<p>The anniversary of the birth of Beethoven, revered as the God of Western music, has arrived again (Beethoven was born on December 16, 1770, and died on March 26, 1826). In past years, various places in the West would have celebrated enthusiastically, holding grand concerts and performing Beethoven's masterpieces. However, amidst the ongoing European war, such activities may not take place this year.</p>
<p>Beethoven is the greatest musician of modern times, worthy of our respect and emulation. Beethoven is his last name; his given name is Ludwig. He was born on December 16, 1770, in a city named Bonn on the banks of the Rhine River in Germany. His father was a talkative man who worked as a professional musician in the royal court. Although respected by the world, his income was meager, and life was exceptionally difficult. Beethoven was his eldest son and was taught sternly by his father all day long. Therefore, Beethoven did not experience any happy days in his childhood, dedicating himself entirely to studying music.</p>
<p>Beethoven began learning the piano at the age of four. At the age of twelve, he was already able to substitute for the famous court musician Neefe. At seventeen, he resigned from his position as a musician and traveled to Vienna, intending to study with the great musician Mozart. Unfortunately, his mother fell ill, so he returned home. At the age of twenty-two, he went to Vienna again, and from then on, he spent his entire life there, studying for two years under the great musician Haydn. At the age of twenty-four, Haydn traveled to England, and Beethoven became a world-class musician. At the age of thirty, his hearing gradually deteriorated, eventually leading to complete deafness. However, Beethoven did not lose heart and continued to work diligently, composing with enthusiasm. After the age of forty-four, he no longer conducted in public, dedicating himself to composing. At the age of fifty-four, he completed the world's most noble, his last "Ninth Symphony," after which he suffered from stomach problems. At the age of fifty-six, he contracted a cold in the late winter, which developed into pneumonia. On the evening of March 26th, at the age of fifty-seven, he passed away peacefully amidst thunder, lightning, and a storm.</p>
<p>Beethoven did not have a home and lived in hotels his entire life. His diligence in practice was beyond the reach of ordinary people. He practiced the piano every day, constantly playing for five or six hours. He often composed while walking, even walking and composing in heavy rain. His masterpieces include "Moonlight Sonata," "Pathetique Sonata," "Kreutzer Sonata," "Sonata in F," "Eroica Symphony," "Waldstein Sonata," and other famous pieces. Beethoven composed a total of nine major symphonies in his lifetime. They are named "First, Second… Ninth" in the order of their composition. The Eroica Symphony is the third type, hence it is also known as the "Third Symphony."</p>
<h3 id="e98">Numbers of "The Great Dictator" <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin's latest masterpiece, "The Great Dictator," premiered worldwide in New York, USA, at the end of last month. The following "statistic" reports:</p>
<p>"The Great Dictator" is sixteen reels long, lasting a full two and a half hours.</p>
<p>Mr. Chaplin's scriptwriting work lasted from January 1st to April 1st, 1940, totaling fifty-one days.</p>
<p>Filming and sound testing began on June 10th and 20th, 1939, respectively.</p>
<p>The casting of actors concluded on September 5th.</p>
<p>The first day of formal filming was September 9th, 1939, and all filming was completed on March 9th, 1940, taking a total of over one hundred and eighty days. Subsequently, a considerable amount of time was spent on editing and dubbing.</p>
<p>Mr. Chaplin contributed $2.2 million to the film's capital, and he did not receive a salary during the filming period.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our evaluation of this film cannot be compared to ordinary, vulgar works!</p>
<p>Charles Laughton has rarely produced works since "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," and fans have been eagerly awaiting his return. According to Movie Mirror, he has completed a new work entitled They Knew What They Wanted. The female lead is Carole Lombard, Clark Gable's wife. This seems to be their first collaboration, so the wonderful results are expected. As for the plot, it tells the tragic story of a passionate woman and a man who must abandon his honor and position to obtain true love. In terms of the plot, the roles of the male and female leads are equally important. However, Charles Laughton, to welcome Carole Lombard's collaboration, willingly gave her top billing, naturally disregarding the size of the "font."</p>

<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>Chen Wozhi was someone Liu Rushi fondly admired, considering him a famous scholar amidst the courtesans, and she quite intended to entrust her life to him. Therefore, on this day, Chen Wozhi's invitation was extremely rare. She paid no heed to Zhang Tianru and immediately went. At the banquet, she offered wine and sang songs, exerting all her efforts to entertain the guests and win Chen Wozhi's favor. Thus, she served until the banquet ended and everyone dispersed before returning home. The journey from Chen's house back to Yixiang Nest was long, with a relatively secluded section. The townspeople went to bed early, and aside from a few wealthy people passing by in carriages, the streets were quiet and gloomy. Liu Rushi was sitting in a small sedan chair, provided by Chen Wozhi, who was worried about her traveling alone late at night. Lanterns were hung behind the chair, and two porters carried Liu Rushi along. Suddenly, several ruffians approached from the opposite direction, having apparently drunk their fill of wine. One of them, nicknamed One-Legged Zhao Qi, puffed out his chest and walked with large steps, with a hint of drunkenness, humming a vulgar song. When Liu Rushi's sedan chair arrived, they did not yield. The porters, unable to run, called out "Chair! Chair!" One-Legged Zhao Qi stood in the center of the street, refusing to move. The porters had no choice but to say, "Hey, please make way." Zhao Qi loudly said, "Why don't you make way? Who is sitting in the chair? Let me take a look." Just then, the porter in front, named Quick-Mouth Ah Er, was extremely impatient and quickly replied, "The sedan chair is carrying Miss Liu of Gui Jia Yuan. We are from the Chen family, escorting her home. Please step aside quickly." Zhao Qi, upon hearing it was Liu Rushi, whom he had long heard of, said, "Miss Liu? Very well, we have long heard of Miss Liu's name but have never had the chance to meet. Now, if you want us to make way, please have Miss Liu come out of the chair and call me 'Dear Brother' three times to my face, and then you may pass safely. Otherwise, don't blame us for being impolite." The porters knew that these ruffians were difficult to deal with, especially when drunk, and the place was quiet with no one to help. They had no choice but to stop the sedan chair. Liu Rushi, hearing Zhao Qi's words from inside the chair, was both surprised and angry. She was a woman of strong character, how could she endure such humiliation? But she also knew that there was no reasoning with these ruffians late at night in a deserted alley. So, she endured and remained silent. Unexpectedly, Zhao Qi stepped forward and lifted the curtain of her sedan chair, saying to her, "Miss Liu, did you hear? Quickly call me 'Dear Brother' three times, and I'll let you go back." The other ruffians applauded and echoed his words. Liu Rushi's face was filled with anger as she said, "You scoundrel, you are extremely rude. Why are you blocking the road in the dark? Leave quickly, or I will have you arrested tomorrow, and you will regret it!" Zhao Qi laughed loudly and said, "We are prepared to face legal trouble. Miss Liu, don't try to scare people with the authorities. You must call tonight, stop the chair, stop the chair!" Zhao Qi and the other ruffians shouted loudly, ordering the porters to stop the sedan chair. Liu Rushi scolded, "Who dares insult me? Death is preferable! Does the law allow this? Porters, call for help!" Quick-Mouth Ah Er did shout "Help!" But he was immediately punched in the back by Zhao Qi. However, suddenly a dark shadow came from behind, shouting loudly, "What's going on? Is someone committing robbery?" (10)</p>
