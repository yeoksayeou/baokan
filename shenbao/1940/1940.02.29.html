<p>社評</p>
<h3>最近日本經濟之剖視</h3>
<p>昨日本報社評，述現代戰爭之物力基礎，並重者三，日武器，曰兵源，日經濟；並槪論日本侵華戰爭中之兵源問題。茲再就經濟方面，檢討日本之作戰能力。</p>
<p>近來歐美各國輿論，對於日本社會經濟情形，頗多著文加以分析，殆已衆口一辭於日本社會已呈不安狀態，亦即經濟情勢正在日趨崩潰。此種普遍見解，當然未可視爲含有何種政治作用，或視爲惡意宣傳；蓋必各有資料取爲立論之根據。日前上　英僑沙遜爵士，在紐約向新聞記者發表類似談話，詎知遽為日本官方所不滿，謂非沙遜爵士之語鋒，刺着日本痛處歟？否則何必若是之悻悻耶？</p>
<p>事實勝於雄辯，日本窘態，要非空言所能掩蔽，亦非編製何種冠冕堂皇之數字所得粉飾。先就財政方面觀之：本年度日本預算（去年四月一號到今年三月底）為九十四億圓，下年度將增至一百零三億圓。偌大預算，如何使得平衡？此其挹注，不出增稅，發行公債，以及膨脹通貨等三種方法。據三菱經濟研究所之調查，在此三種辦怯之下，日本政府旣於去年底入不敷出者達九億七千萬圓；本年度猶然，下年度預算愈鉅，困難更甚，勢必不敷尤多；謂將增稅歟？則現在旣類渴澤而漁，再增稅未必猶能增加收入；謂繼續發行公債歟？則本年度規定爲五十六億圓，下年度爲五十七億圓；以實在發行數量言，去年四月到十二月，共發四十一億圓，平均每月爲四億六千萬圓元，較之前三年旣增九倍。若將日本歷年所發公債額，加上下年度的預算額，將超過三百億圓以上。以日本國民七千萬人担負三百億圓之公債，則每一老弱婦孺，每一苦力，每殘廢乞丐，平均皆須負担四百圓以上，此何種現象耶？</p>
<p>玫彼公債，雖曰發行，其實大都尤塞於銀行銀庫；最近日本竟擬用彩票力式，發行小額公債；具見其民間消納公債能力之薄弱。然則謂將更事膨脹通貨歟？日本經濟學家，久已發出惡性膨脹之警告。去年底日本銀行所發紙幣總額達三十億圓，約爲三年前之兩倍有餘。此外尚有其他銀行在日本本部以外所發行之鈔票與小額鈔票，尚未計算在內。抑不惟膨脹之爲惡性，惡性之爲患而己，幣值實已銳跌。蓋日圓在外滙上之價值，最近兩年來，雖在表面上所降甚微，實際已大非昔比；試觀彼以政治軍事勢力，扶助其在中國淪陷區內之對華貨幣戰爭，宜可以恣爲抑揚，無求不得矣，然證以黑市上之日圓滙價，充分暴露日政府已無法維持其法定的標準。據美國方面所獲可信之資料，日本金準備即將告罄，日圓在國際之價值，恐難　不在最近將來發生劇變。此次日本空前龐大之預算案，在衆議院中竟獲嘿然通過，夫豈日本當局與議員，對於預算案之實施，豈智珠在握，成竹在胸，斯泰然使之確立而絕無問題？而彼度支主管所作模稜之答復，噯昧之說明，又豈有其莫測之高深歟？謂非因各有深切認識，明知反對與不反對，在事實上之無辦法厥均，斯苟且其議政之過程耳。</p>
<p>再就一般經濟情勢言，日本之向政府發爲警告者非無其人；同時，亦復有自欺欺人之樂觀論調焉，謂對外貿易好轉矣，乃係光明之徵。誠以去年日本出口值三十五億圓，入口值二十八億圓，數額上爲出超六億圓。但分析其內容，去年度日本之大量出超，實得之於帶有强制性之所謂「日圓集團」範圍之貿易：至於對歐美各國之貿易，則非但未能出超，却爲入超四億圓；秘密性質之軍火輸入之代價，猶不在其列。據日本之經濟研究者所分析，去年對所謂『日圓集團』之出超，由於所謂復興華北華南，建設僞滿，緣是而需要大量機械與原料之關係云；在彼範圍內之事，與其謂爲貿易，無寗視爲搬動，根本非有一般貿易上之價值；或日於當前之日本國民經濟，非惟無益，抑且有損；觀於最近日政府忽爾宣佈此後在華工業不能專賴日本原料，個中利害消息，蓋可於此窺之矣。</p>
<p>他如日本國內工商農業之活動，在彼政府强力統制之下，當然不易發見何種變化與破綻，顧亦非無蛛絲馬跡可尋。、例如工業生產，據估計，去年九月較前年同期减低百分之六，四；其中礦業約增加百分之五，製造業則减低百分之八。在製造業中重工業增百分之十五，電氣與煤氣增百分之八，其他紡織業化學工業等則各有减低。夷攷其實，復非爾爾。蓋如近數月來之煤荒與電荒，引起工業界發生重大恐慌，勢必直接影響及於各種生產；而其間趨向發達之軍需工業，表面上雖亦能支持一部份國民生活之活氣，然根本上徒爲中國消耗戰之對象而並非生產性之工業。又如商業，政府宣佈銀行存款增加，去年達二百五十億圓，物價變化不大，僅較前年增加百分之十五。然存款增加之原因，半由强制之吸收，半由通貨之膨脹；至於物價之上張無多，乃以政府所規定之官價，爲標準，各種重要物品，蓋無不有其黑市價格焉；證以日本政府公佈去年所發現之違怯交易，較前年激增七倍，可知日本商業內情之如何混亂。再如農業，根據農業統計、去年生產曾有大量增加。日農相前曾公開報告，去年食米收穫量爲六千九百萬担，較預算數爲大，比前年增加百分之四·六。夫可信歟？何以事實上一反歷年現象而因米荒發生騷動？阿部內閣何以因食米問題而崩潰？紙面數字詎得消弭事實上之嚴重性耶。總之，從任何一方面觀察，日本經濟上之裂痕，觸目皆是也。</p>
<p>現代國家，無論在平時或戰時，都不能完全目給自足。平時國際經濟往來，可以促使兩國經濟繁榮；戰時國際經濟援助，更是決勝之重要因素。日本在國內經濟方面旣是無法支持，而在國際方面，更絕無援助。於是可以論斷中日戰爭之前途！</p>
<h3>江門新會日軍　迭遭華軍奇襲　日援軍中伏傷亡甚衆　殘部沒中新鶴公路敗退</h3>

<h3>津租界當局限制　麵粉售價</h3>
<p>天津　津市麵粉缺乏情形、日見緊迫當局最近自澳洲日本兩處輸入麵粉一百餘萬袋、但津市每月平均消費數量每三十萬戶卽須一百萬袋故仍有杯水車薪之槪、同峙粉價上漲漫無止境、美國政府對於出口麵粉津貼之數、雖已自每桶一角五分（美金）提高至一元四角（美金）顧津市粉價之漲風仍未稍戢、此其原因不外兩端、一爲當地幣價之跌落、二爲歐戰爆發之後、世界市塲上粉價不斷上漲是也、加之自北平「臨時政府」實施匯兌統制辦法以來、華北貨物之輸往、非日金集團各國者日見减少、而內地貨物來源、又因運輸困難之故、多被切斷、結果外幣遂益感短絀、此與粉價之上漲亦不無關係、此間英法兩租界當局、鑒於「粉荒」日甚一日、目下卽已漲至每袋廿元之高峯、爰乃採取各項措置、以取締投機者之操縱、法租界當局並巳令界內各糧食商號、按每袋十五元之限價發售、英租界工部局則限令各商號辦理麵粉存底登記、並實施各項緊急統制措置、結果界內粉價卽降至十五元五角、最近華界內雖已發生搶刧麵粉情事、英法兩租界內尚無此種舉動、則不得不歸功於租界當局之應付有方也、（哈瓦斯廿七日電）</p>

<h3>海軍預算通過衆院　英國決用全力　保持海上霸權　應付對德潛艇水雷戰爭　邱吉爾稱具有絕對把握　納爾遜號中魚雷已徴實</h3>
<p>倫敦　邱吉爾海相所提出之下年度海軍經費案、頃由下議院表決通過、按政府對於國防各部門經費、因欲保守機密、僅提出象徴數目、錄部門計一百鎊云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　海軍大臣邱吉爾昨在下院提出海軍預算時、於滿塲歡呼中發言、調余代表海軍來此請求多造數艦並多撥若干經費、使海車得進行其工作、海軍與海軍部之職務與行其職務時所遇之狀况、以及吾人雖極勉力、然慘苦損失不能免之情形、今巳漸得更廣大之了解、吾人於此唯有格外奮勉盡其職責、而以良好結果使國人滿意耳、余所憾者、關於所擬海軍力量與經費之事實與數字、未便向下院據實言之耳、</p>
<p>截至一九三九年底、德國因各種原因已喪失其所有潛艇之半數、而在最近兩日中、德潛艇之喪失已確定者一艘、大部份已確定者又兩艘、目前戰爭中首當其衝者厥爲海軍、如他日無所顧慮、則余當首先提議檢討海軍之力量與需要、惟此時機會猶未到時、吾人無時不期料敵方將以更大的範圍之攻擊施於吾人所依恃之供應綫、數月前余曾估計德國出產潛艇之速度爲每星期兩艘、今知此說錯誤、縱將來德國或能如是、但截至一九三九年底、迄未能每週造成潛艇兩艘也、一九三九年底德國共有潛艇約四十五艘、其中二十艘須加訓練、其能服役海上者大約二十五艘耳、而此二十五艘尚須分爲二三班輪流出發、故同時出動者其數不能甚多、揣度每次不過十艘、德潛艇喪失日增、但吾人非俟確知其巳沉後、不發表潛艇沉失消息、雖潛艇出沒海上爲數寥寥、然吾人非無多大損失、</p>
<p>就此觀之、下院可見吾人所應作之準備、必應如何周密而廣大矣、此項準備吾人今巳爲之、俾應付將來或有之大攻擊、預料夏季以後、新造之德潛艇將逐漸活動、而吾人亦將以最適宜摧毀潛艇之新式大飛機應付之、今夏吾人將以最大之速度建造此種新飛機、同時新商船之出產率現巳設法大增、俾補充必不可免之損失、德潛艇現被迫不用砲、亦不用魚雷、而改在吾人港口埋置磁性或非磁性之水雷、磁性水雷雖在機械上製作頗巧、然並不是特殊新奇、余現可謂吾人已發現戰勝此種磁性水雷及其他同類物之方法、吾人在科學上並不遜於德人、（衆歡呼）</p>
<p>應付磁性水雷之手續有兩階段、第一爲查明何以制之、第二爲旣知所以制之、乃積極用此知識、吾人現已達第二階段、雖吾人不可不預料敵方將來必用此種方法、以更重大之打擊加諸吾人、然吾人相信必能有以應付之、吾人欲應付水雷攻擊、不得不利用漁船與漁民、雖本年吾人尚須水兵二十五萬人供我遣調、然在去年十一月底已募義勇隊數萬人担任掃蕩水雷工作、義勇隊之担任工作、僅以三個月爲期、但此時期必須展長、今巳顯然、許多海港中之義勇隊原來担任三月工作者、今巳有四分之三願在戰爭期中繼續服務、海軍部刻將有以償其志願、（衆歡呼）</p>
<p>德國若干飛行家攻擊未置武裝之船隻、及掃射避於救生艇中之船員、其行爲之殘忍無可辯護、吾人乃不得不設法使吾人漁船及各小船悉備有自衛之工具、吾人現知德機若干、見漁船備有砲火向之射擊、即迅速遁去、吾人頃所發給各種大小砲位供客船與漁船用者已數千尊、德國乃指此爲其破壤公約的巳有行爲之理由、德國當然將更積極施用其方法、希特勒與其黨徒之殘酷、較諸上次戰爭時德國所爲者有過之無不及、德國所施遠法兇暴與野蠻之行爲、今漸被人所接受、一若爲每日尋常之舉、然此誠余平生經歷中最怪異事件之一也、中立國報紙在余發表言論告以何者爲其責任時、輒譁然置辯、而在某船隻被擊沉時、反不若是鼓噪、其故何歟、（衆大笑）實則其海員在公海上溺死或被害者數逾千矣、</p>
<p>中立國目前所抱之主義、殆爲德國所贊同、因依此主義、德國可用破壤一切規則之種種暴行獲取某種利益、而後於其認爲適當時、要求他國對其業已撕毀之國際條規、予以極嚴格之解釋、俾獲取另一種利益、此種情形無怪英政府厭棄之、即余亦厭棄之矣、（衆大笑）余可毫無躊躇而言曰、在涉及中立國的國際法規之解釋中、必以人道而非法律迂論爲吾人之主要指導、就「阿爾特馬克」號事察之、此似不獨爲英國之輿論、即文明世界之輿論亦如是也、</p>
<p>吾人此時在主力艦方面、佔有毫無疑問之優勢、否則德國巡洋重艦將出現於大西洋、橫行無忌、對於吾人無此不能生活之全部貿易、縱不停止之、亦將阻撓之、且可在地球各處設立臨時根據地、而扼守英國無法進攻之地位矣、苟如是、吾人不將迅速趨於減亡乎、幸而吾人主力艦遠較敵方爲强、如敵艦果敢出現、吾人隨時準備以更大力量與之周旋、而使之消減如「斯比」號然、吾人苟無優勢之戰鬥艦隊、吾人何能握取海權、更何能保持吾人生活、英國在上次戰爭中、須時常準備戰鬥艦三四十艘及其附腸之艦隊、以期隨時對德決戰、但今日則此種佈置已大減矣、蓋敵國今所有之眞正巨艦僅兩艘耳、不能希圖成立陣綫也、英國則至少可成立三偭陣綫、皆非德國力能對抗、故吾人現可分佈軍艦較前爲廣、同時又可常駐充量軍艦於海上、準備於敵艦出現時迎頭痛擊、吾人之整個海權實繫於此、</p>
<p>英國現所造之新艦能擋受天空轟炸、且更適宜於水底爆裂、逈非今日軍艦所可及、英海軍力量尤勿庸過慮、英艦「巴哈姆」號係一舊艦、雖遭魚雷轟擊、並未大毀、不久將修理完竣出海服役、又「納爾遜」號造成十五年、爲磁性水雷所傷、不日亦將復入艦隊、此係機密消息、當然爲數萬人所共知、但保持秘密、直至不復有重要關係時、始任其傳洩於德國（衆大笑）除「王家橡樹」號與「勇敢」號兩艘、自戰爭開始以來、其他巨艦未有損毀或沉失者、自汽機發明後、歷來戰爭中、大小軍艦從未有如此次繼續不斷時常巡邏海上者、開戰後、最初一百十九日中、而軍艦雖機器巳老、猶出沒波濤中歷九十日而不巳、英海軍機械組之能力於此可見、今後軍艦增多、　長夜短、飛機偵察更遠、故全部違禁品管理制、定可愈爲有效、就海軍觀察點而言、使封鎖更臻嚴峻並不困難、惟基於對外關係的政治決定之重要性質、亦未可漠視、故些二者之平衡不得不維持也吾人在過去六個月、喪失軍艦六萬三千噸、約及上次戰爭最初六個月中捐失之牛、吾人商船得失相抵後、在二千一百萬噸中、喪失尚不及二十萬噸、查一九一七年四月一偭月中船隻、共喪失四十五萬噸、誠不能與此相提並論矣、吾人所截獲運往敵國之貨物、以噸位計、較吾人所喪失者爲多云、（廿八日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　昨日海相邱吉爾第一次宣布曾於去年十二月間觸雷之戰艦「納爾遜」號、當時艦身洞穿、衆信若干艦員受傷、「納爾遜」號排水量三萬五千噸、造成雖巳歷十五年、仍爲英艦隊中最强大軍艦之一、裝有十六吋口徑主砲九·六吋口徑砲十二、（廿八日路透社電）</p>

<p>淸查棧單上海市商會昨接協泰興·永大·堃源興·勤大·章堃和·瑞泰·昇大、等十六家煤號來函、以棧單持有人、不能出淸存貨、皆由廠方造成、故持有人非但不能負担棧租、且應由廠方負担賠償棧單持有人之損失、特函請調查實情、轉致煤球公會、知照各廠從速增加生產、交淸棧單存貨、並盡量供給另售等情、當由商人函復云、「查各煤球廠應盡量生產、以期供求相劑、早經本會再三函令煤球公會、督率同業辦理在案、至棧單持有人、目前有無如期出貨、與各該廠不能交貨之事、迄未據持有人來函報告、現距截止之期僅有三天、如有此事、應請將其棧單號數戶名、數量及廠名、逐一列舉、以憑查詰、是爲至要、但傳聞新棧單自限期出淸後、父秘塡不少、今始截止、似已晚矣、</p>

<h3>所得稅處解釋　補發上年股息問題　應併入本年所得額計算</h3>

<p>先行減除股息、故如有以本年之盈餘、袖派上年股息者、於所得稅之計算、事實上尚不致有何影響、惟公司組織之營利事業、因公司怯第一七一條、定有公司非彌補損失、不得分派股息之限制、則其補發股息時、勢必先已彌補損失、即與第一類所得稅征收須知第十七項規定不合、自應將此項補發股息及彌補損失部份金額、仍一併加入本年度</p>
<p>所得額內計算，相應函復、即希查照爲荷、等因、過會、查此項解釋、關係非止一業、用特錄函通告、即希查照分轉所屬同業依據辦理、是爲至企、</p>

<p>磋跎靑春，這是最引人傷感的！因爲人生的靑春期能有幾何？惜之不暇，何能任其磋跎？所以說『花開堪折直須折，莫待無花空折枝。』成年男女，有機會有活力談愛情的時候，就得好好地享受些愛情的幸福，道是人生所應當的，可是眞正的愛情，必須以健康爲基礎。所謂活力亦即此意。要是男子於早年犯有自凟遺精，或早婚縱慾，或憂勞過度，虧損了生殖腺內分泌液，或新傷了性神經者，則凡陽痿，發育不全，腎虧不育，腰痠背痛，神經衰弱，未老先衰等症象即不一而足。此種病夫，雖有如花美眷，在春宵良夜，夫婦生活亦必不能美滿，或如曇花一現，或竟一籌莫展，無法人道，這怎能不引起妻子的憎恨呢？世間夫婦，由此而愛情破裂，演出反目失歡，私奔離婚等悲劇者，眞是不知其數！</p>
<p>病夫欲治愈其症象，增進其夫婦間的愛情，以挽回人生應享之幸福者，在今日醫學昌明的時代，已非爲難事。但切不可亂服春藥與雜藥。因服春藥猶疲馬加鞭，積久必一蹶不振，終至不可收拾。服用雜藥，則每致金錢虛擲，成效甚鮮，或竟貽誤治療時機！據世界名醫及余等經騐，均以服健壯動物生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，最爲對症特效，因此劑係根據新醫學上最有效之補給療法的原理，採取雄壯動物如猴猿，猩猩，獅虎，熊鹿，海狗等體中的生殖腺內分泌精華，用科學複製法精製而威，所以品質名貴，補力偉大，爲任何類似製劑所不及。男子於服用「生殖素」後一日夜間即可生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，助長發育。繼續連服，必於短期內治愈各症，使精力倍增。中老年人常服，則延年益壽，返老還童。惟有遺精者，須兼服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」（中西五洲等大藥房及永安公司西藥部均售每盒實價兩元）</p>
<p>患者鄭良君，婚後患腎虧陽痿症甚劇，且有遺精。致形容枯耗，夫婦惡感日深，月前由其友介紹至本診所治，即囑其購「生殖素」一打，「希米脫氏固精片」三盒，使這兼服，迄今未及一月，頃已百霍然，精力豐足，夫婦間的恩愛勝於新婚矣。</p>

<h3>可恥孰甚！竟因　乳峯萎癟受盡氣惱！</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>自從女子須有健康美的呼號傳遍到了各個都市以後，一般　侍脂粉衣飾裝點的病態西施，便爲社會唾棄，交際塲中沒有她們挿足的餘地了。不寗惟是，而且她們因着身體上的種種缺陷，如乳峯萎瘍，臀部瘦削，肌肉枯　，花容憔悴等等，即在家庭里，亦難免受着種種刺戟，茲試舉最近來函詢問的一例如下，聰明的女郎，應該有所　悟了，原文如后：「…………要說我的環境，家里僱有許多傭僕，出入有汽車代步，服裝的講究，享用的精美，可說極盡人間富貴，在理應該知道滿足了，有何氣惱可言呢？但事實上因爲我自小　多病多痛，現在更患着月經不調，白帶，頭昏，腹痛，神倦，一年到頭，極少有健爽的日子，而尤其覺得抱憾的，因病廠的不時侵襲，竟至容顏憔悴，肌肉枯槁，臀部瘦削，而乳峯尤其萎癟得可憐，我無論怎麽樣打扮，可是走出去，人們看到我，不知怎的，總是竊竊私議，有一位快嘴的親戚，背地里竟稱我『老槍寡老」，而「椒鹽排骨」，「乾癟老太婆」，在傭僕們的口里，似乎更當了正當稱呼，我聽到了此種譏訥，眞眞氣得發昏，然而發昏有什麼用呢？唉！年屆花信，猶無理想對象，靑春虛度，能不…………」以某小姐的環境，其遭遇猶如此，其他環境不如她的人，則其命運的悲慘，也就可想而知了。不過時至今日，科學萬能，此種缺陷，也是很易彌補。蓋乳瘍顏衰的主要原因，完全爲卵巢機能失健，影嚮新陳代謝作用所致。此時如服以對症良藥卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，則不難於短期內消滅上述各症，使身體日臻强健，則乳峯自然高聳，面頰自然紅潤，倘繼續服用，且能却病延年，靑春長駐。</p>
<h3>一年之計在於春　遺精靑年快覺醒</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>當此萬物萌動的春大，正該是我們及時努力的時候。若再糊塗過去，那就要蹉跎一年，或竟至誤了終身！所以我們必須要鍛練着身體，使之强壯，以奠定我們前程的幸福之基。可是靑年人當此春情發動的春天，最易犯自凟縱慾等行爲，因此，斵傷了性神經，使精關鬆弛，爆發着遺精症。患有遺精症的靑年，在此春大，若不速治愈，那尤爲危險！因爲到將來春暖洋洋之後，精關必愈益鬆弛，很容易由輕症的夢遺症而變爲險症的滑精漏精症或因體內精液的虧乏，使腦，性，春髓等神經，呈高度的衰弱，發育機能停滯，新陳代謝作用减退，於是凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰痠背痛，早洩陽痿，發育不全，未老先衰等症象業生。此種病態靑年，將如何能研究其學術，發展其事業，以創造他遠大的前程！更如何能爲女性所愛戀，妻妾所歡悅，於是失戀，失歡，遂陷入人生慘痛的境地！</p>
<p>靑年人若能早日覺悟，則遺精症並非爲不治之症。治療之法，須淸心寡慾，戒絕自凟，同時服以治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」（中西中英等大藥房均售每匣實價兩元）以固精關，鎭靜神經，患者服後於當夜即可收安眠止遺之特效。如因遺精已有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，速服一月，必可收却病强身之功。患者若能親來本診所診治，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>糧食　米商投機心難死　洋米到源雖旺米價仍漲</h3>
<p>邇來米價、一路下遊、一號西貢售四十三元半之價、與去年四十三元之收盤行情而論、相差巳僅半元、將紅盤內所升九元巨價、悉數跌去、方爲民食慶幸、其如及午又以金價穩健、匯水轉緊、人心復昂、一般浮戶客囤、再度搜羅、轉呈回勢、昨則開手尚有餘波、雖去路平常、奈客販等懷貨者、均抱產地定價已難劃合、不以途貨之多寡及銀根等周轉與否、消其居奇之念、不約而同、羣相持貨扳守、莫肯輕脫、浮囤客戶、深中下懷、相率不出、致市上籌碼無論回籠亦屬寥寥、於是作客即欲問津、祇得仰其鼻息、近午本鄉店胃見市面暴跌後回、乘勢採辦、市價乃即提升、收盤各色洋米行情、悉比前市較增半元之譜、若一號西貢自晨聞四十四元半後、直售至四十五元半、中間上落計達一元、二號自四十二元三角售至四十三元、火紋尖收盤四十四元、小絞三月份期貨原包五十一元半、現貨每担四十元零六角至四十二元半、東京砶尖高至四十一元半次至四十元零五角、最次如糙米者祗三十九元、混合碎高自三十四元半次至三十三元、至於糯米國貨、以底盤較低、一遇市色轉機、即多着意搜辦、而價格亦較易提足、故昨騾升一元半左右、不過香港洋糯僅能相隨洋米並加半元光景、厚薄粳及早晚稲等國米、聞塲外暗盤相助回高　元有奇、且崑錫眞特粳以缺貨獨俏、竟售五十三元、惟中次者仍祗四十七八元、特薄稻四十八元、早晚稻四十六元、而內地來源由虹口轉到界內者、昨祗有南港早晚稻四五百包而已、</p>

<p>小麥　昨日交易尚可、計開蘇州及蚌埠麥兩種、成交共有十車、仍由日廠收進、按近日粉價疲落後、少數行囤亦願脫手、惟目下存底有限、一時不易過小、故開價尚站二十五元關、較前日略見降小云、</p>

<h3>證劵　內債醞釀</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、更趨混沌、消息雖有德國擬再試探調停中日戰事、但巳不爲市塲所重視、其癥結所在、祇以銀根太緊、資本家無力及此、故愈見冷落、惟其醞釀待變之潛勢力、依然存在、未可忽視、因大戶多空互相聲持、並未搖動也、昨日兩市、價格極爲呆滯、上落至微、無非檯面屢進屢出、祇元康及十六號稍有買進、中一潤利及久豐等稍有賣出、餘則零星點綴而巳、結果略爲回好五分一角至二角、成交數約四十餘萬元、茲列簡表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交達豐紗廠股二十股、價爲一百元正、又聞中國銀行股二十股、價爲六十五元云、</p>
<p>衆業公所股市、潛勢略趨疲軟、買戶定單、至易完成、但未見有賣方眞實壓力、會得豐股仍堅、站穩於一百零九元半、怡和紗廠股四十二元之價、需求良好、橡皮股仍黯淡、除　格志橡皮信任暨地榜等股外、其他甚少興趣、</p>

<h3>紗花　三月期紗　逼近九百元關</h3>
<p>紗中續趨上升、而局勢尙穩、此因原棉及各項開繳昂貴、以致廠方成本提高、所以紗廠家無意賣紗、於是人心激昂、對於三月期紗紛紛收進、同時華南一帶諸帮、紗銷漸形起色、市面乃愈見挺分、三月期最高價爲八百九十五元、</p>
<p>現紗晨市態略平、因外棉及金價無大變化、二十支雙馬開價爲八百六十五元、三月期價爲八百八十五元、此價一開、買者稍增、檯風轉緊、徐徐做至八百七十三四元、三月期爲八百九十五元、中途雖經獲利者吐出、但氣勢仍挺昂、查半日間成交統計二千一百四十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲六元至十元、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、同行一、九○○計港二四五統計　、一四五</p>
<h3>廠辦雖寂　棉價尙定</h3>
<p>本棉交易尚稱不薄、但廠方仍少採辦、惟同行成交殊形熱鬧、人心堅挺、市價穩定、惟外棉亦在盤旋之中、然匯市不鬆、仍難合算也、蘇北午後到通花一千二百十八包、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>另訉外棉市價、紐約棉市昨日先因利物浦來電良好而漲、後因大衆賣出、及一部份之倒限價者賣出而回小、結果收盤價格較之上日略小三五磅音、印度棉市日來漲風殊盛、昨日連同預測又漲四羅比、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊形呆滯、各同業心意頗爲高昂、惟因銀根　緊、交易數額大减、廠方購意頗爲淡薄、前訂之貨、又有大批湧到、本週內將有美棉四萬包運到也、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元八一二五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>疋頭　三月期貨已開　本客銷路活躍　售盤大都較高</h3>
<p>國布　昨棉布市二月份期已滿、三月份之價格較月內每疋高五角至一元、故本街現墊心思頗濃、白貨售盤每疋漲　角半之譜、漂染印花紗錢布每疋漲五角至七角半、本街成交白貨粗細斜紋坯布五百餘包、漂染印花布三百餘件、溫州帮辦細布粗布府綢花布色布色斜近二百餘件、閩帮辦府綢條漂色布一百餘件、粤港帮辦細布府裯花布斜紋一百數埂件、南洋帮暹羅新加坡等地辦標布色布印花布五千餘疋、</p>

<h3>糖市　洋糖回降</h3>
<p>昨糖市因連日上漲過　、又值外匯放長、價乃轉鬆、公會劃盤二四粗白外棧新到六十二元二角、小八角、老貨六十一元七角、小元許、太古車白小一元四角至元許、西棧B嘜六十五元一角、東棧六十四元九角、小六角、HX嘜六十二元、小一元、H嘜車赤仍爲四十五元至四十四元半、荷赤小五角、WA嘜四十六元半、WP嘜四十七元、國糖市面依然穩定、建帮開出刁靑二六十包、四十六元半、又一百十五簍、四十五元八角、興化帮開出宮粉百餘包、五十八元至五十八元半、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤明定暗賤</h3>
<p>白煤市况售方心思雖堅、奈一交春令、銷塲未免呆滯、囤戶手貨、亦逐漸放出、乃爲本街猛殺、故門市價亦見鬆、　開鴻基提塊每噸一百九十元、篩塊一百八十元，統某一百七十五元、海峯白煤因　店清肆需要仍旺、故仍擯持原盤</p>

<h3>病入膏肓</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>現社會病微的明顯，病情的複雜，病勢的嚴重，已經不容許我們再諱疾忌醫了。</p>
<p>東歪西倒的露屍，街頭巷尾的餓莩，搶米案的層出不窮，在在都可以證明醫治社會病症是刻不容緩的了。</p>
<p>在物價暴漲的今日，社會矛盾的現象，已經到了最頂點。我們一方面看兄餓莩賊道，一方面看見投機商人把米麵煤囤積起來，廢置不用。</p>
<p>米麵煤的出產，其最大的目的，是要增進大衆生活的幸福，是要由大家去利用的。可是現在不是了，現在的社會制度，已經走上了一條牛角尖似的死路，使這些日常生活的必需品，成爲商人牟利的工具，成爲投機取巧把持的商品；使大部份的食糧燃料，成爲囤積的廢物，而同時却使大多數的民衆，生活於飢寒交迫的生死綫上。</p>
<p>陷多數無辜的民衆於生活的困境中的社會制度，難道是合理的嗎？使少數人度着過份奢侈的生活，而同時握着能制多數人的死命的力量，把生活必需的物品囤積起來，而任令多數不幸者在悲慘的命運之下掙扎着，這樣的一個社會，還能說是沒有毛病嗎？</p>
<p>告訴你，我們的社會已經病入膏肓了！</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>獨生子</h3>
<p>— 溫和</p>
<p>父母的愛子女，本是由於天性；但是獨生的兒童，往往受到特別的溺愛。這種情形在中國尤其顯著，因爲中國人項相信傳宗接代，獨生子女的責任旣然特別重大，做父母的也就特別疼愛他了。這些獨生兒童，幼時受到了畸形的溺愛敎育，他們的個性發展一定跟平常的兒童不一樣；他們成丁之後，再沒有父母去溺愛他們了，那時他們的生活恐怕也要跟別人不同。對於這些問題，中國人一向不加注意，這裏特介紹一位美國心理學家白立爾研究的報告。</p>
<p>白立爾氏研究了四百個巳經成人的獨生的或是受溺愛的子女，他們的年齡頂輕的是十八歲，頂高是六十八歲：其中男性的佔一七二人，女性的佔二二八人，他在這許多人中發現一種共同的現象：就是他們都很難在生存競爭中跟別人去較量，他們向都受了母親的顧惜和撫養，因此他們都缺乏獨立的精神和自信心。</p>
<p>獨生子在幼時就同成人們混在一塊，他常常是早熟的。而且在他長大時，他不慣去交際同他年齡差不多的人。他可以說沒有什麼朋友，他不能適應他的社會。</p>
<p>獨生子在小時候有什麽要求，父母總答應他，他有什麽過失，父母也不去管教。這樣他成年之後，稍爲受人家一點輕視，他心裏就要難過到好幾天，甚至好幾禮拜之久。有一個獨生的小姐，同她一個好朋友一同去參加集會，因爲在會塲中她的朋及比她還要受人注目，她氣憤之下，竟然企圖自殺了。</p>
<p>獨生子沒有兄弟姊妹的競爭，一家之中，好像完全是他在作主；他又從小聽慣了別人讚美的話，遝樣他不得不覺得世界上是「唯我獨尊」的了。他不單自負，而且嫉妬心也非常厲害。他對於親友的幸福，很是妬忌，所以人家看見他也覺得討厭了。這樣無怪他要鬱悶不樂了。</p>
<p>獨生兒童因爲受到父母的溺愛，他的精神力很難轉向到別的異性去，因此他的愛情生活也是異常的了。在白立爾氏所統計的四百個人中，其中的百分之三十六都有異乎尋常的愛情生活，他們或是同性戀者，或是偷窺狂者，露體狂者，虐待狂者，被虐狂者等等。其中的百分之十八是患着各種不同型的「早發衰退症」的，換言之這輩人巳經離瘋人不遠了。</p>
<p>歷史上受溺愛敎育敎養出來的獨生子的例子，可推羅馬暴君尼羅。然而沒有受溺愛放縱的獨生子，也可以發展得同平常的兒童一樣，而且很可能出人頭地，譬如找國大聖孔子就是個獨生子，他可以作爲受到良好敎育的獨生子的代表。</p>
<h3>行行出狀元</h3>

<p>逸聞</p>
<h3>威爾斯與呼呼爵士舌戰</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>最近蜚聲於國際上的，有兩位威爾斯先生。一位是美國的國務卿，他奉命前往歐洲。考察英法德義四國，有所建議，不　是個和平使者。但另一位英國歷史作家，即以「未來世界」一書出名的威爾斯，他却是一位戰神。</p>
<p>作家的威爾斯近曾與德國的演說家呼呼爵士，作了一塲舌戰，很引起人們的注意。事實是這樣：威爾斯不久前在美國權威刋物「自由」雜誌上，發表一篇文字，他附和蕭伯納約主張，以爲前綫不攻不戰的狀態，使人頽喪，英國空軍該大舉轟炸柏林。他寫道：「我是一個和平主義者，但却是一個眞正的和平者。德國的舉動不僅擾亂世界，而且阻碍進化的輪子，故我們非轟炸他們不可。轟炸的方法本是德國用來施虐於其他民族的，現在我們要他目食其果。」</p>
<p>威爾斯的言論一時爲大家注目，就引起德國評論家呼呼爵士（Lord　Haw　haw）的憤慨。爵士是德國無綫電台惟一的辯才，能操流利的英語。每天晚上，他必藉無綫電波向不列顛國民衆，大放厥辭，議論英國朝政得失。聽了威爾斯的言論，他就向英國民衆恫嚇道：「柏林如果落下一枚炸彈，我們要回敬倫敦十枚。我勸英國人不要胆大妄爲，因爲我們方面報復手段的慘毒，有非歷史家的腦子如威爾斯者所能想像得到的呀。」</p>
<p>有人就把呼呼爵士的桃釁，叩詢威爾斯的感想，他毫不介意，說這是德國軟弱的暴露，驚悸的哀號，德人要有胆量，在去年九月大炸華沙時，就敢來轟炸英倫了。「總之，我以爲與其利用海軍封鎖，把德人餓死，還不如把他們炸死。這種辦法直捷了當，好讓他們的神志早日淸楚。」</p>
<p>威爾斯的一席激烈的談話，確乎得到一般的歡迎與興奮；但截止目下為止，政界的穩重者流，還沒有贊同派機轟炸柏林的，事實上還不過是威爾斯與德方宣傳家的一塲舌戰而巳。</p>
<h3>威爾期像</h3>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>發明家的先見之明</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>自古以來，許多科學家和發明家的偉大貢獻，固然促進人類的文明，而使人生趨於更美滿，更有意義的境界；但另一方面他們却又「助紂爲虐」，助長人類劣根性的發展，而使世界更加悲慘，不寗起來。究竟是功是罪？是造福是作孽？這是很不容易分別淸楚的。不過發明家並不是沒有先見之明的，他們早巳顧慮到這一點了！飛艇的發明者拉那（Francesco　Land）在一六七〇年時，已料到他的發明準會遺禍於後世；他的發明雖告成功，但他認爲最遺憾的就是他巳替不法之徒創造了一種幹不人道和無理性暴行的利器。</p>
<p>十五世紀意大利的大藝術家兼科學家達芬奇（Leonardoda　Vinci）應當是潛水艇的最早發明者·從他的筆記中，我們可以發見他爲什麽不將他所發明的潛水法公開出來的理由：「因人類具有深固之好殺天性，勢必將利用此法於水底潛襲船舶，殺人越貨，無所不爲。」</p>
<p>痛心得很，這種遠古的頂言在二十世紀的今日都一一成爲事實了。飛機和潛艇巳在好幾决戰爭中表演過屠殺無辜的威力，於今更是變本加厲。這些發明家在九泉之下有知，恐怕亦要負疚不安的。</p>

<h3>不是「命運」！</h3>
<p>— 錢昌年</p>
<p>「從前」的中國人往往喜歡把臨到的災難認做「命該如此」，比如自己失業，說是「命運」；妻子跟別人跑，說是「命運」；脊樑上生了一個瘡，大腿給蚊子可了一口也說是「命運」。更有人以爲命運不是人力所能抵抗的，也無法避免的，因此，對於災難的原因便不去細察了。</p>
<p>相信命運就是「不信任自己」，結果是將自己活埋在命運裏面。</p>
<p>以上是說「從前」，目前似乎該不如此了。可是，有些人還弄不淸楚，比如：米價從八塊一担漲到五十塊吧！就有人嘆「命苦」，也不去深思這到底是不是「命」，或是有「更明顯」的理由？即使升到一百元一担，還有人以爲是「命裏注定」！</p>
<p>囤戶的貧慾是無止境的，希望大家思籌一個妥善的制裁辦法。同時更要認淸了物價昂貴的原因，並不是「命」裏該！</p>
<h3>斧柄</h3>
<p>— 洪飛</p>
<p>——一個現代的童話——</p>
<p>在很久很久以前，當時誰也沒有夢想到希特勒，有一天，一個樵夫到樹林裏去，他懇請衆樹讓他的斧頭配一支柄。</p>
<p>大樹們看見這麽小的一個要求，就慷慨地答應了，並且決議由那樸實無華的白楊樹去供給樵夫以斧柄。樵夫把斧柄配好，立刻，就東砍西伐，把樹林中的大樹都砍倒了。</p>
<p>橡樹看見事情糟糕得很，曉得悔之已晚，便低聲同杉樹說：「想不到第一次的讓步，竟使我們同歸於盡了；要是我們沒慷他人之慨，犧牲了我們的賤鄰，那麽我們說不定可以永久生存下去也說不定呢。」</p>

<h3>昆明之電影院　用土語譯講西片大意　新式電影院已吿落成</h3>
<p>— 泰隆</p>
<p>昆明爲現在西南最繁華之區，各娛樂塲斯頗見興盛，而電影事業亦漸見發達，各電影院賣座極佳，並聞原在重慶之「中製」亦有遷滇之說。</p>
<p>昆明原有電影院祇逸樂和大衆一家，所映影片大都西片，國片甚少；惟西片均甚陳舊，如滬上三輪戲院所映者。</p>
<p>最近新式電影院，「南屏」大戲院巳告落成，其建築不論外貌內觀皆極富麗，設備極完美，足與滬上頭輪電影院相媲美。每屆假日，各院無不客滿，因此有人預購戲票，開映前再提高票價兜讓與人，售票處有兒童專爲代客購票，略取少許酬費，開映時，擴音機內播奏中國國歌，銀幕上顯映孫總理林主席蔣委員長，及省主席龍雲之相片時，觀衆都起立致敬，廣告燈片有數十張之多，聞係取費低廉之故，燈片掉換甚速，然後始映正片，影院爲不請英語之觀衆明瞭劇情起見，特於月樓上設一翻譯員，把片中對白大意，高聲用雲南土語譯出，然現在本省人觀衆不多，故不諳英語之外省觀業，若亦不諳雲南土語者，對於片中對白大竟是否徹底明瞭，恐尚成問題也。</p>
<h3>上海書塲新陣容</h3>
<p>— 聿修</p>
<p>舊歷新年，是各書塲調檔的季節，所以「年檔」開書，各塲子無不陣容一新。不過上海書塲，在「大嚮檔」包辦的情形之下，雖說調檔，也終究是個換湯不換藥的老調，還是這幾張看得爛熟了的面孔。並目書塲有限，人材過剩，雖「大嚮檔」亦不免有向隅之虞。現在蔣朱和夏荷生的我不到地槃，就是一例。</p>
<p>日塲以東方的實力最爲雄厚，朱趙，沈薛和楊變檔，都是彈詞中的權威，就是吳均安同許繼祥，也各有號召的力量。唐馮擋的果報錄，雖比較峪遜，但在東方則人地相宜，極受歡迎，所以蟬聯，次之要算湖　了。日塲小書除朱趙而外，有嚴雪亭和周蔣檔，大書張鴻聲的英烈，也很走紅；夜塲則是淸一色的潤餘社天下，但僅黃異庵一檔，差强人意。</p>
<p>雅廬的日塲較遜，陳瑞麟雖開生書九絲縧，但也少有叫座能力。就是曹仁安的吳越春秋和湯康伯的水泊梁山，也都叫人聽得厥極發膩了。夜塲擁有周蔣，朱趙和張鴻聲外，顧宏伯的狸貓換太子，也到處受人歡迎。其實顧書長處，只有爽快二字，像說工，襯托和脚色，比之乃師楊蓮靑相差尚遠，南園日塲的李仲康，是彈詞大王李伯康的介弟，說唱頗有乃兄風度；惜中氣不足，喉嚨帶沙，但韻味則仍極雋永動聽</p>
<p>匯泉樓是資格最老的書塲，今年却少特別精彩，惟肯選用二檔新進人才，却是　樁好事。一檔是日塲的龐學庭和謝漢庭，彈唱落金扇，他們是蔣如庭的弟子，所以說唱一似乃師，琵琶紋子，彈來尤好，一檔是夜塲嚴筱祥的西漢，技藝如何，因未嘗領敎，不敢妄論。早檔書仍爲曹仁安的列幽。此外龍泉富春，旗鼓相當，互有短長。至於普餘社的女彈詞，因人力有限，無從發展，所以現仍侷促南京書塲　隅；而自謝小天遺嫁之後，三天檔的號召力量，也爲之大减。所以今日普餘社除非能有堅强的增援，一時很難挽救這種頽勢。</p>
<h3>記六齡神童　舒朶雲之起解</h3>
<p>— 屮屮</p>
<p>海上古柏公餘兩票房，在夏歷新正曾演戲　火，各票友均出其拿手傑作，以娛覜衆，共演戲二十餘齣，記者欲逐一論評，但限於篇幅，勢不可能，惟最引入注意者，厥爲舒舍予君之令媛朶雲小妹妹。（現在建樹小學二年級）年齡僅六歲，所演蘇三起解，居然老到，舉止表情，均與鑼鼓相合，從容不迫，毫不慌張，亦不矜持，唱工穩練，板槽極準，是日名小生兪振飛君亦佇立台上，終塲拍掌不止，對於「洪洞縣內無好人」一句拋下注杖將小嘴鼓起之表情，尤贊賞不置。此戲爲鄂森律師夫人所親授，名師出高徒，言不虛也　、左　　其戲裝。</p>
<h3>「中國影訊」</h3>
<p>— 遊記者</p>
<p>三月十五日創刊</p>
<p>本年的出版界將有一種巨大的刋物出現，那便是專載中國電影新聞的週刋——「中國影訊」。由於「亞洲影訊」的成功，使中國電影界遭遇了部分困難，那就是說西片宣傳與觀衆的成功。爲了這，也不僅提倡電影文化的原因吧，有幾個熱心國產電影的人決定創辦一個「中國影訊」週刋，定三月十五日出版。</p>
<p>據記者所知，他們資本相當充足，在有限公司組織下依廣告來維持，用道林紙精印，八開的二頁，與「亞洲影訊」相同，圖文並重，特約專家撰稿各影片公司戲院也出力贊助</p>
<p>爲了大規模的計劃，對於售價暫售每份五分，全年訂價連郵二元，並且每期有戲券和影星照片贈獎，以鼓勵定戶的興趣，這當然也是一件影迷們樂於知道的新聞吧？</p>

<h3>聽黃金二進宮（上）</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>奚嘯伯於農曆庚辰元旦登黃金之臺，由二牌老生一躍而爲頭牌，這是一件喜事，本當早日前柱一聽佳奏，半月以來，買票艱難，空城計碰碑皆錯過未聽，至二十一日貼演二進宮，始由唱友張君定座約往，先看了速環套拜山盜鈞，高盛麟扮天霸，唱做表白學楊小樓，具體而微，幾次笑聲，須再加研究，現在年輕，將來可望大成。裘盛戎扮竇爾　，前有盜馬未及看見，拜山之唱，鼻音太多，做工白口有時過火，有時惜力，大槪爲留氣力，好唱二進宮，吾想裘應學其父裘桂仙，不應學金少山，盜鈎一塲換李克昌，頗能稱職，唱學黃三，亦頗有味。</p>
<p>二進宮開始，侯玉蘭扮李艷妃上塲，唱一段二簧正板，是老腔，尚稱平穩。奚嘯伯唱千歲爺一段，妥當無疵，精彩不多，嗓子可吃正工調，高處有餘，寬處略差。凡各戲園元宵以前半月中，日夜雙工，角兒嗓音，無不受其影響，最好嗓子，亦必打一九折，精神亦如久戰之兵，勇氣疲憊，所以門襤精工之老顧曲家，元宵節前多不入戲館，今奚等三人尚有此成續，算得有過人天賦矣。</p>

<h3>Great Victory for the Eastern Henan Army in Xinyang; Japanese Army Suffers Crushing Defeat Attempting to Invade Luoshan Along the Highway; Battle Situation on Yongbin Road in Southern Guangxi Calms Down Yesterday</h3>
<p>Nanyang: The Japanese army in Dongwulidian, Xinyang, successively reinforced their troops on the 24th and 25th, committing arson and murder everywhere. Taking advantage of the mass escape of civilians, they advanced towards the county seat of Luoshan along the highway. After fierce resistance by the Chinese army, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties but continued to reinforce and advance south. On the night of the 25th, the Chinese army heavily surrounded the Japanese army in the vicinity of Luoshan, inflicting a crushing blow and launching a fierce attack on the Japanese flanks. The Japanese army retreated step by step, and the Chinese army pursued and annihilated them at every turn. That night, the Japanese army near Luoshan was completely cleared. At the same time, a unit of the Chinese army suddenly attacked Zhongshanpu, destroying the Xin-Luo Highway to prevent the Japanese army from retreating, and closely coordinated with the Chinese army advancing from the west of Luoshan, launching a pincer attack to annihilate the Japanese. By noon on the 26th, the invading Japanese army had been completely annihilated. In this battle, over 760 Japanese bodies were left behind, and the Chinese army seized a large number of spoils.

<h3>Chongqing Garrison Command Announces Forced Evacuation of Residents</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Chongqing Garrison Headquarters officially announced today that starting from March 1st, it will begin to forcibly evacuate Chongqing residents who do not have valid residence permits.

Currently, Chongqing's air-raid shelters can only accommodate 200,000 people, and the garrison headquarters has already issued that number of residence permits, so it is announced that no new permits will be issued. Over the past week, the weather has been clear, and residents believe that Chongqing may be subject to air raids at any time. However, rain in the past two days has slightly reduced residents' anxiety. According to the garrison headquarters' population evacuation plan, it will be implemented starting on February 1st and is expected to be completed within March. The garrison headquarters urged residents to leave the city in February and designated travel expenses for long-distance buses and ships. (Reuters, 28th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>An Analysis of the Recent Japanese Economy</h3>
<p>Yesterday's editorial in this newspaper discussed the material foundation of modern warfare, emphasizing three key elements: weaponry, manpower, and the economy. It also generally discussed the issue of manpower in Japan's war of aggression against China. Now, we will further examine Japan's combat capabilities from an economic perspective.</p>
<p>Recently, the press in various European and American countries has written extensively analyzing the socio-economic situation in Japan, and they have almost unanimously concluded that Japanese society is in a state of unrest, and that the economic situation is deteriorating. This widespread view should not be regarded as containing any political agenda or as malicious propaganda, as each must have its own sources of information as the basis for its arguments. A few days ago, Sir Victor Sassoon, a British expatriate, made similar remarks to reporters in New York, which were immediately met with displeasure from Japanese officials. Could it be that Sir Victor Sassoon's words struck a nerve with Japan? Otherwise, why would they be so resentful?</p>
<p>Facts speak louder than words. Japan's predicament cannot be hidden by empty words, nor can it be glossed over by fabricating any grand figures. First, let's look at the financial aspect: Japan's budget for this year (from April 1st of last year to the end of March this year) is 9.4 billion yen, and it will increase to 10.3 billion yen next year. How can such a large budget be balanced? The sources of revenue are no more than three methods: increasing taxes, issuing public bonds, and inflating the currency. According to a survey by the Mitsubishi Economic Research Institute, under these three methods, the Japanese government's deficit reached 970 million yen by the end of last year. The situation is the same this year, and the budget for next year is even larger, so the difficulty will be even greater, and the deficit will inevitably be even larger. Will taxes be increased? The current situation is already like draining a pond to catch all the fish, and increasing taxes may not even increase revenue. Will public bonds continue to be issued? The amount set for this year is 5.6 billion yen, and for next year it is 5.7 billion yen. In terms of the actual amount issued, a total of 4.1 billion yen was issued from April to December of last year, an average of 460 million yen per month, which is nine times more than in the previous three years. If we add up the amount of public bonds issued by Japan over the years, plus the budgeted amount for next year, it will exceed 30 billion yen. With a population of 70 million, each person must bear 400 yen. What kind of phenomenon is this?</p>
<p>Although these public bonds are said to be issued, they are mostly hoarded in bank vaults. Recently, Japan even plans to issue small-denomination public bonds in the form of lotteries, which shows the weakness of the public's ability to absorb public bonds. Then, will the currency be inflated further? Japanese economists have long issued warnings about malignant inflation. The total amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan at the end of last year reached 3 billion yen, which is more than double what it was three years ago. In addition, there are other banknotes and small-denomination banknotes issued by other banks outside the Japanese mainland, which are not included in the calculation. It is not only that inflation is malignant and that malignancy is a problem, but also that the value of the currency has actually fallen sharply. Although the value of the yen in foreign exchange has fallen only slightly on the surface in the past two years, it is actually very different from what it used to be. Just look at how it uses political and military power to support its currency war against China in the occupied areas, where it can do whatever it wants. However, the exchange rate of the yen on the black market fully exposes the fact that the Japanese government can no longer maintain its legal standard. According to reliable information obtained from the United States, Japan's gold reserves are about to run out, and the international value of the yen may inevitably undergo drastic changes in the near future. This unprecedentedly large budget proposal in Japan was actually approved in the House of Representatives without a word. Is it because Japanese authorities and legislators have a firm grasp of the implementation of the budget and are confident that there will be no problems? Or is there some unfathomable profundity in the ambiguous answers and explanations made by the finance officials? It is because everyone has a deep understanding and knows that opposing and not opposing are equally ineffective in practice, so they are perfunctorily going through the process of deliberation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in terms of the general economic situation, there are those in Japan who have issued warnings to the government. At the same time, there are also self-deceiving and optimistic views, saying that the improvement in foreign trade is a sign of hope. Indeed, last year Japan's exports were worth 3.5 billion yen and imports were worth 2.8 billion yen, resulting in a trade surplus of 600 million yen in terms of value. But analyzing its contents, last year's large Japanese trade surplus was actually obtained from trade within the so-called "Yen Bloc," as for trade with European and American countries, not only was there no trade surplus, but there was a trade deficit of 400 million yen. The cost of secret imports of military supplies is not even included in this figure. According to the analysis of Japanese economic researchers, the trade surplus with the so-called "Yen Bloc" last year was due to the so-called reconstruction of North and South China and the construction of Manchukuo, which required a large amount of machinery and raw materials. The matters within that scope, rather than being considered trade, can be regarded as moving things around, and fundamentally do not have the value of general trade. It may be said that it is not only useless to the current Japanese national economy, but also harmful. Looking at the recent sudden announcement by the Japanese government that industry in China can no longer rely solely on Japanese raw materials, one can get a glimpse of the advantages and disadvantages of the situation.</p>
<p>As for the activities of industry, commerce, and agriculture in Japan, it is naturally not easy to find any changes and flaws under the strong control of the government, but it is not without clues to be found. For example, industrial production is estimated to have decreased by 6.4% in September of last year compared to the same period of the previous year. Mining increased by about 5%, while manufacturing decreased by 8%. In manufacturing, heavy industry increased by 15%, electricity and gas increased by 8%, while other industries such as textiles and chemicals decreased. In fact, this is not entirely the case. The coal and electricity shortages in recent months have caused major panic in the industrial sector, which will inevitably directly affect various types of production. While the military industry, which is trending towards development, can superficially support a part of the national livelihood, it is fundamentally only a target for the war of attrition in China and is not a productive industry. Regarding commerce, the government announced that bank deposits have increased to 25 billion yen last year, and that prices have not changed much, increasing by only 15% compared to the previous year. However, the reason for the increase in deposits is half due to forced absorption and half due to currency inflation. As for the small increase in prices, it is based on the official prices set by the government. Various important items all have their black market prices. The Japanese government announced that the number of illegal transactions discovered last year increased sevenfold compared to the previous year, which shows how chaotic the internal affairs of Japanese commerce are. As for agriculture, according to agricultural statistics, production increased significantly last year. The Japanese Minister of Agriculture previously publicly reported that the rice harvest last year was 69 million dan, which was larger than the budgeted number and increased by 4.6% compared to the previous year. Is this credible? Why does the opposite of the historical phenomenon actually occur, and riots occur due to the rice shortage? Why did the Abe Cabinet collapse due to the rice problem? Can paper numbers eliminate the seriousness of the facts? In short, observing from any aspect, the cracks in the Japanese economy are all visible.</p>
<p>Modern nations, whether in peacetime or wartime, cannot be completely self-sufficient. In peacetime, international economic exchanges can promote the economic prosperity of both countries. In wartime, international economic assistance is an important factor in determining victory. Japan cannot support itself domestically, and there is no international assistance. Therefore, we can predict the future of the Sino-Japanese War!</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Jiangmen and Xinhui Repeatedly Ambushed by Chinese Army; Japanese Reinforcements Ambushed, Suffering Heavy Casualties; Remnants Retreat Along Xinhe Highway</h3>
<p>Zhaoqing: The Japanese troops trapped in Jiangmen and Xinhui have been repeatedly ambushed by the Chinese army recently, causing extreme panic. On the night of the 24th, several hundred Japanese troops were dispatched from Jiujiang to reinforce them but were ambushed by the Chinese army on Gangzhou Road, suffering heavy casualties. Their remnants fled along the Xinhe Road, only to be ambushed again by the Chinese army near Maowu. They then retreated back along their original route. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: On the night of the 23rd, taking advantage of the dim moonlight, the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on Xihu Chashan, Dongguan County. The Japanese army did not dare to engage in battle and immediately fled. The Chinese army captured Yuan Haoru and Yuan Rong, the chief and deputy chiefs of the puppet maintenance committee, seized over 200 rifles and other military supplies, and destroyed the Guanlong Highway.

<h3>American Ambassador to Arrive in Chongqing Today</h3>
<p>Chongqing: American Ambassador Johnson will arrive here tomorrow, which is attracting widespread attention. This is not only because the ambassador is undertaking a special mission, but more importantly because the ambassador recently traveled to Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, and traveled along the Yangtze River to and from Hankou on an American gunboat. He also traveled by car along the newly built Yunnan-Sichuan Highway. According to American highway experts, this highway is the best in southwestern China. People from all walks of life here are eager to learn about the American ambassador's impressions of his travels. However, the ambassador is known for his discretion and does not easily speak out when interviewed by reporters. Therefore, it is expected that the ambassador will not say much when meeting guests in order to satisfy public expectations. When the ambassador left Chongqing, the US government terminated the US-Japan commercial treaty, which gave the United States a new and important position in the future development of the situation in the Far East. Therefore, there is special concern here about the ambassador's arrival in Chongqing this time. After the ambassador arrives, the number of foreign ambassadors in Chongqing will increase to four, making it the largest gathering of foreign diplomats in China's wartime capital. In addition to the US ambassador, the current ambassadors stationed here include British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, French Ambassador Cosme, and Soviet Ambassador Pan Youxin. The Soviet ambassador has never left Chongqing since presenting his credentials last year, and the British and French ambassadors have also been in Chongqing for nearly two months. Other foreign diplomats in Chongqing include representatives from the Italian, Belgian, Dutch legations. The staff of the British Embassy in Chongqing include the leader of the British diplomatic mission, Mr. Broadmead, and Air Attaché Captain Aitken. In addition, Deputy Military Attaché Captain Miller is also coming to Chongqing from Shanghai and will likely be stationed here for a long time. (Reuters, 28th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Concession Authorities Restrict Flour Prices</h3>
<p>Tianjin: The flour shortage in Tianjin is becoming increasingly acute. The authorities recently imported over one million bags of flour from Australia and Japan, but the average monthly consumption in Tianjin is one million bags for every 300,000 households, so it is still a drop in the bucket. At the same time, flour prices are rising endlessly. Although the US government has increased the subsidy for flour exports from 15 cents (US dollars) per barrel to 1.40 dollars (US dollars), the price of flour in Tianjin has not decreased. The reasons for this are nothing more than two: one is the fall in the local currency's value, and the other is the continuous rise in flour prices on the world market after the outbreak of the European war. In addition, since the "Provisional Government" in Beijing implemented exchange controls, the export of goods from North China to countries outside the Yen Bloc has decreased daily, and the source of goods from the interior has been cut off due to transportation difficulties. As a result, foreign currencies are becoming increasingly scarce, which is also related to the rise in flour prices. The British and French concession authorities, in view of the increasingly severe "flour shortage," which has now risen to a peak of 20 yuan per bag, have taken various measures to crack down on speculators. The French concession authorities have ordered all grain merchants in the concession to sell flour at a limited price of 15 yuan per bag. The British concession's Public Works Department has ordered all merchants to register their flour stocks and implement various emergency control measures. As a result, flour prices in the concession have fallen to 15.50 yuan. Although flour robberies have recently occurred in the Chinese area, there have been no such incidents in the British and French concessions, which must be attributed to the concession authorities' effective handling of the situation.

<h3>Gao Tao Also Discloses: The Contents of the Liang-Japan Secret Agreements; Previously Acknowledged One by One by Wang Jingwei; Japanese Side Exclusively Occupies Central China Resources</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Gao Zongwu and Tao Xisheng yesterday continued to mail to this newspaper the full text of various secret agreements and contracts successively signed by Liang Hongzhi and others of the Nanjing puppet organization with the Japanese side. They also stated that before Wang Jingwei signed the (Japan-Wang Secret Agreement), the original text of each of these agreements and contracts was sent to Wang by the Japanese special affairs organs, and after he acknowledged them one by one, the second item of the so-called (Essentials for the Adjustment of New Japan-China Relations) stipulated, (Acknowledging the existing facts before the restoration of new national relations during the Incident.) The third item of the (Principles for Adjusting the New Japan-China Relations) stipulated that an (economically strong Japan-China combined zone) should be established in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River region. The various secret agreements and contracts signed by Liang were regarded by Japan as (existing facts). The various secret agreements and contracts were specific plans to promote the (economically strong combined zone in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River region). These included the resources, mining, railways, aviation, telegraph, telephone, water and electricity, and urban construction of Central China. According to their methods, they not only had exclusivity but also profound xenophobia; they not only had deceptive characteristics but also obvious plundering characteristics; they not only had economic characteristics but also full military characteristics. Wang betrayed his motherland and received a more concrete and subtle ironclad proof. Herewith, the various secret agreements and contracts sent by Gao and Tao are specifically disclosed in eight categories.</p>
<p>First, regarding the exclusive occupation of national defense resources, although the outline signed only has three articles, it has exhaustively covered all secondary sources in Central China. The provisions of the third article clearly refuse the participation of third countries. This undertaking not only adopts a policy of non-permission for the present and the future, but also quickly finds ways to cancel those that have already been permitted or have been engaged in development for a long time in the past. The original text of the secret agreement is as follows: Essentials for Handling the Development of Important National Defense Mineral Resources in Central China (Policy): In order to cope with the long-term resistance of the National Government and to start long-term construction, the important national defense mineral resources stored in the Central China region should be quickly planned and developed.

Second, regarding the development and control of iron and steel, a special company will be established to operate it. Not only will it seize existing mines, but also undiscovered mines. The original text is as follows: Outline for the Establishment of Central China Iron and Mining Joint Stock Company: (1) To develop and control iron mines in the Central China area. (2) First, establish a company in accordance with the following methods: (1) Established in accordance with the rules for the establishment of initiators.

<h3>Navy Budget Passed by the House of Representatives; Britain Determined to Use All Its Strength to Maintain Maritime Hegemony and Cope with Submarine and Mine Warfare Against Germany; Churchill Claims Absolute Confidence; Torpedoing of HMS Nelson Confirmed</h3>
<p>London - The next fiscal year's naval budget proposed by First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill was recently passed by the House of Commons. According to the government, due to the desire to maintain secrecy regarding the budgets of various national defense departments, only symbolic figures were presented, with each department accounting for £100. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London - When introducing the naval budget to the House of Commons yesterday, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill spoke amidst cheers, saying, "I represent the Navy in requesting the construction of more ships and the allocation of more funds so that the Navy can carry out its work. The duties of the Navy and the Admiralty, the circumstances they encounter while performing their duties, and the inevitable, albeit regrettable, losses we suffer despite our best efforts are now gradually becoming more widely understood. In this regard, we can only strive even harder to fulfill our responsibilities and satisfy the nation with good results. My only regret is that I cannot accurately reveal the facts and figures regarding the proposed naval strength and budget to the House."</p>
<p>"By the end of 1939, Germany had lost half of its submarines for various reasons. In the last two days, the loss of one German submarine has been confirmed, and the loss of two more is largely confirmed. The Navy is at the forefront of the current war. If there were no other considerations, I would first propose reviewing the Navy's strength and needs. However, the time is not yet right. We constantly anticipate that the enemy will launch even greater attacks on our lifeline of supplies. A few months ago, I estimated Germany's submarine production rate at two per week. I now know this was incorrect. Even if Germany is capable of this in the future, it had not managed to build two submarines per week by the end of 1939. At the end of 1939, Germany had about 45 submarines, 20 of which required training, leaving approximately 25 seaworthy. These 25 would have to be divided into two or three groups for rotation, so the number deployed at any one time would not be very large, perhaps no more than ten. The number of German submarines lost is increasing daily, but we do not release news of submarine sinkings until we are certain they have sunk. Although the number of submarines appearing at sea is small, we have not been without significant losses."</p>
<p>"From this, the House can see how thorough and extensive our preparations must be. We are now making these preparations to cope with any major attacks that may occur in the future. We anticipate that new German submarines will gradually become active after the summer, and we will respond with new types of large aircraft best suited to destroying submarines. This summer, we will build these new aircraft at maximum speed. At the same time, the production rate of new merchant ships is now being increased to compensate for inevitable losses. German submarines are now forced to avoid using cannons or torpedoes, and instead lay magnetic or non-magnetic mines in our ports. Although magnetic mines are mechanically ingenious, they are not particularly novel. I can now say that we have discovered a method to defeat these magnetic mines and similar devices. We are not inferior to the Germans in science." (Cheers)</p>
<p>"The procedure for dealing with magnetic mines has two stages: first, to determine how to defeat them; second, having learned how to defeat them, to actively use this knowledge. We have now reached the second stage. Although we must anticipate that the enemy will use this method in the future to inflict even greater blows upon us, we believe we will be able to cope with them. To deal with mine attacks, we must utilize fishing boats and fishermen. Although we still need 250,000 sailors for deployment this year, we recruited tens of thousands of volunteers to undertake mine-sweeping operations at the end of last November. The volunteers' service was initially set for three months, but this period must be extended, as is now evident. Three-quarters of the volunteers in many seaports who were originally serving for three months have now expressed their willingness to continue serving for the duration of the war. The Admiralty is now preparing to fulfill their wishes." (Cheers)</p>
<p>"Some German aviators have attacked unarmed vessels and strafed crew members taking refuge in lifeboats. Such cruel behavior is indefensible. We have had to find ways to equip our fishing boats and small vessels with self-defense tools. We now know that some German aircraft, upon seeing that fishing boats are armed with cannons, quickly retreat. We have recently issued thousands of cannons of various sizes for use on passenger ships and fishing boats. Germany cites this as justification for its own violations of conventions. Germany will certainly use its methods more aggressively. The cruelty of Hitler and his party surpasses that of Germany in the last war. The violent and barbaric actions taken by Germany are now gradually being accepted as if they were everyday occurrences. This is truly one of the strangest events I have ever experienced. When I make statements informing neutral countries of their responsibilities, they vehemently object, but they do not protest as loudly when ships are sunk. Why is that?" (Laughter) "In fact, the number of their sailors who have drowned or been killed on the high seas exceeds a thousand."</p>
<p>"The doctrine currently embraced by neutral countries is almost endorsed by Germany. According to this doctrine, Germany can gain a certain advantage by using all kinds of atrocities that violate all rules, and then, when it deems appropriate, demand that other countries apply the international rules it has already torn up with extreme strictness to gain another advantage. It is no wonder that the British government rejects this, and so do I." (Laughter) "I can say without hesitation that in the interpretation of international rules involving neutral countries, our primary guidance must be humanity, not legal quibbles. As the 'Altmark' incident shows, this seems to be the opinion not only of Britain but of the civilized world."</p>
<p>"We currently have an unquestionable advantage in terms of battleships. Otherwise, German heavy cruisers would appear in the Atlantic and roam unchecked, halting, or at least hindering, our entire trade, without which we cannot live. They could also establish temporary bases throughout the globe and hold positions that Britain could not attack. If that were the case, would we not quickly decline? Fortunately, our battleships are far stronger than the enemy's. If enemy ships dare to appear, we are ready at any time to engage them with greater force and reduce them like the 'Graf Spee.' If we did not have a superior battle fleet, how could we seize naval power, and how could we maintain our livelihood? In the last war, Britain had to constantly prepare three to four dozen battleships and their accompanying fleets in order to fight a decisive battle against Germany at any time. But today, this kind of arrangement has been greatly reduced because the enemy now has only two real capital ships and cannot hope to form a line of battle. Britain can form at least three lines of battle, none of which Germany can withstand. Therefore, we can now deploy warships more widely than before, while still maintaining a sufficient number of warships at sea, ready to strike a heavy blow when enemy ships appear. Our entire naval power depends on this."</p>
<p>"The new ships currently being built by Britain are able to withstand aerial bombardment and are more resistant to underwater explosions, far surpassing today's warships. There is no need to worry excessively about British naval power. HMS Barham, an old ship, was not greatly damaged despite being hit by a torpedo and will soon be repaired and returned to service. HMS Nelson, built 15 years ago, was damaged by a magnetic mine and will also rejoin the fleet soon. This is confidential information, of course, known to tens of thousands of people, but kept secret until it is no longer of great importance, and then allowed to leak to Germany." (Laughter) "Apart from HMS Royal Oak and HMS Courageous, no other capital ships have been damaged or sunk since the start of the war. Since the invention of the steam engine, never in the history of warfare have warships of all sizes patrolled the sea as continuously and frequently as this time. In the first 119 days after the start of the war, warships, even with aging machinery, were on the waves for 90 days. This demonstrates the capabilities of the British naval engineering team. In the future, as more warships are added, the nights will be shorter, and aircraft reconnaissance will be more extensive, so the entire contraband control system will certainly become more effective. From the naval observation point, it is not difficult to make the blockade more stringent, but the importance of political decisions based on foreign relations cannot be ignored, so a balance between these two must be maintained. In the past six months, we have lost 63,000 tons of warships, about half of the losses in the first six months of the last war. After offsetting gains and losses in merchant ships, we have lost less than 200,000 tons out of 21 million tons. In April 1917 alone, ship losses totaled 450,000 tons, which is incomparable to this. We have intercepted more goods destined for enemy countries, by tonnage, than we have lost." (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>London - Yesterday, First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill announced for the first time that the battleship HMS Nelson, which struck a mine in December of last year, had its hull pierced, and it was believed that some crew members were injured. HMS Nelson, with a displacement of 35,000 tons and built 15 years ago, is still one of the most powerful warships in the British fleet, armed with nine 16-inch main guns and twelve 6-inch guns. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - Yesterday, Churchill admitted in a report to the House of Commons that the British warship HMS Nelson had been severely damaged and also admitted that the warship HMS Barham had been hit by a torpedo. HMS Nelson is one of the two most powerful battleships in the world, launched in 1925, with a displacement of 33,950 tons, a speed of 23.5 knots, a crew of 1,320, and armed with nine 16-inch guns, twelve 6-inch guns, six 4.7-inch anti-aircraft guns, twenty-two other anti-aircraft guns, and eight machine guns, as well as two torpedo tubes.

<h3>A Shrew Can Transform into a Meek Lamb!</h3>
<p>"The daughter of the congee family marries into the rice family." Since ancient times, in marriages, the man's family should always be slightly better than the woman's. This is the proper way, and there is a profound reason for it. It would take too long to explain in detail. The same is true for the sexual life of a married couple. If the man's sexual ability is not slightly superior, it will inevitably affect the establishment of the husband's authority and weaken his control. This will diminish the wife's admiration and respect. As a result, jealousy arises, and the wife becomes domineering. The once proud man has no choice but to yield and submit because of his inner shame. However, over time, there is no joy in conjugal harmony, and the husband's authority is completely lost. What is the point of life? To seek happiness, why not immediately purchase the "Polemin fanlels" mystical elixir for enhancing sexual vitality from the Western Music Department of Wing On Company? Currently, it is on special offer, with each bottle of French currency costing one yuan, and you get one free when you buy one. This medicine can strengthen your body, fortify your kidneys, and consolidate your essence. Soon after taking it, it can change your style, transforming weakness into strength and making you physically robust. At that time, the other party will be surprised and delighted. From then on, her psychology will shift, and her shrewish roars will cease. In the bedroom, she will cling to her husband like a little bird, docile and submissive, just like a pair of meek lambs.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Repeatedly Reconnoiter German Naval Bases and Scatter Leaflets over Berlin; Germany Claims One British Aircraft Shot Down; Germany Also Loses Two Aircraft in Britain</h3>
<p>London - The Air Ministry has announced that multiple British aircraft have repeatedly conducted reconnaissance flights over the German naval base at Heligoland Bight in the past two days, with considerable success. They also flew to various locations along the German North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts, as well as Berlin and Hamburg, before returning. One aircraft has not returned to base and is presumed lost. In addition, we shot down two enemy aircraft off our coast today. Since the start of the war, a total of 43 German aircraft have been shot down over or off the coast of our country, and another nine aircraft, after being attacked by our aircraft, are believed not to have returned to base. Air Force sources also said that British aircraft, while conducting reconnaissance over Berlin this morning, scattered leaflets in the city and its suburbs. They encountered one German aircraft but did not engage. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>

<h3>One German Warship Sunk by a French Warship</h3>
<p>Paris - The Navy Ministry has announced that the French destroyer "Simon" has sunk a German submarine off Cape Finisterre in northwestern Spain. When the "Simon" spotted the submarine's periscope, it immediately steamed towards it and dropped several depth charges. The submarine submerged for a while and then resurfaced. The "Simon" rammed it head-on and dropped another batch of depth charges. Soon after, a slick of oil, stretching for eight nautical miles, appeared on the surface, indicating that the submarine had undoubtedly sunk. The "Simon" sustained minor damage in the collision. (Note: The ship has a displacement of 1,319 tons and belongs to the same class as the "Sirocco," which has sunk three German submarines.) (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>US House of Representatives Reduces Naval Budget</h3>
<p>Washington - When President Roosevelt submitted his budget message to Congress in early January, he requested an appropriation of $15 million to build a third lock at the Panama Canal.

<h3>Soviet Union Expands Far East Navy, Causing Concern in Japan; Outstanding Issues Between the Two Countries Become More Difficult to Resolve Satisfactorily</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" argued that reports of the Soviet Union's increasing naval strength in the Far East are of "extreme concern" to Japan. The newspaper quoted the Deputy Chairman of the Soviet People's Commissariat for the Navy as saying that the Soviet Union has 100 submarines, 12 torpedo boats, and other auxiliary ships based in Vladivostok in the Far East. "From the Soviet Union's point of view, the Soviet Union has the right to implement the above policies, but it is doubtful whether these policies are in line with current Japan-Soviet relations." The newspaper indicated that the commercial negotiations held in Moscow and the agreement by the opposing parties to organize a demarcation committee could indicate an improvement in Japan-Soviet relations, but warned that Japan-Soviet naval competition would hinder the satisfactory resolution of outstanding issues between the two countries. "If the Soviet Union's goal is to increase the strength of its Pacific Fleet, then Japan must, in addition to adjusting diplomatic relations, seriously consider countermeasures."

<h3>350,000 Soviet Troops Launch Full-Scale Assault on Viipuri; Aircraft and Artillery Assist Infantry Operations; Finnish Defenders Ordered to Retreat 25 Miles</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - According to reliable sources, fighting is extremely fierce on the Karelian Isthmus front. The Red Army, with 350,000 troops, has been launching a fierce assault on a 50-kilometer front near Viipuri for the past 48 hours, and the battle is still raging. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland - Well-informed sources here have said that the Red Army on the Karelian Isthmus front, in an effort to capture the port of Viipuri, has launched a large-scale offensive, involving no fewer than 14 divisions. The entire area from Viipuri to the coast of Lake Vuoksi is a war zone, with the most intense fighting concentrated around the town of Kamelelä (located on the banks of Lake Näykkijärvi and the River Vuoksi). According to a war report released by the Finnish General Staff, artillery fire is extremely intense on the Karelian Isthmus front. Our troops are putting up a strong resistance and have inflicted heavy losses on the enemy, and have also defeated several Red Army units northeast of Lake Ladoga. In addition, the enemy's air force has not been very active. Our air force has repeatedly conducted reconnaissance flights yesterday and has bombed enemy troops with considerable success. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - According to a telephone call from Helsinki received here today, Finnish General Staff Commander Marshal Mannerheim today ordered the evacuation of Finnish troops and civilians within 25 miles of Viipuri. At the same time, Finnish troops in Viipuri are moving north, concentrating in the Suomaa, Kamelelä, Gao Mei Di, Vuos, and Taipaoli areas. According to the Finnish side, the Soviet offensive began with a large number of aircraft bombing, followed by tank assaults and infantry advances. The recent increase in Soviet air force activity is due to Finnish acquisition of foreign aircraft assistance, which prompted the Soviet Union to take preemptive action. Several new divisions of Soviet troops have also been added in the Petsamo area of northern Finland, putting great pressure on Finnish troops, aiming to drive them inland to prevent them from making contact with the British Navy.

<p>Stockholm, Sweden - The Soviet army, having occupied the Koivisto fortress, opened the way for advance. When Soviet troops reach the tip of the Koivisto Peninsula, they will be only five miles from the main Finnish coast near the civilian-evacuated Sakijärvi. Therefore, the Finnish army in the Karelian Isthmus campaign may soon have to establish a new position for defense. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to a communiqué from the Leningrad Military District Headquarters, yesterday in the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops broke through enemy fortifications again, occupying 13 fortresses, including nine strong batteries. There were no other significant developments in other areas. In some areas, the Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets with great success. Six enemy aircraft were shot down in air battles. (TASS dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Helsinki, Finland - The Finnish side admitted last night that the Soviet army had won a victory south of Petsamo. The Finnish army's position was originally 10 kilometers south of Petsamo, but due to the Soviet army's continued offensive within 24 hours, the Finnish army retreated another 15 kilometers in several places.

<h3>US Senate Finance Committee Debates Trade Agreement Issue; Mentions Anglo-Turkish Tobacco Agreement; Vandenberg Opposes Embargo Against Japan</h3>
<p>Washington - The US Senate Finance Committee debated the trade agreement issue today. Senator La Follette said that the United States should find ways to deal with agreements made by belligerent and neutral countries that are detrimental to US trade, such as the Anglo-Turkish tobacco agreement. Senator Barkley said that if the United States forced Britain and France to buy tobacco from the United States, rather than providing them with US aircraft and other war materials, what would the result be? Agriculture Secretary Wallace replied that this would undoubtedly cause deep resentment and distrust towards us. If the United States attempts to force belligerent countries to buy agricultural products from the United States as if purchasing their needed munitions, then belligerent countries may retaliate economically after the war. Congress should continue its reciprocal trade program to create a valuable foundation for the future reconstruction of world trade. Senator La Follette then said that he heard the Anglo-Turkish agreement lasted for 25 years. Wallace replied that British Ambassador Lothian had told him that news reports about the agreement were inaccurate and that the British Ambassador hoped to discuss the matter with us another day. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>New York - Republican Senator Vandenberg recently sent a letter to Mr. Lippmann, a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune, opposing the imposition of an embargo on Japan. He said, "If the United States imposes an embargo on Japan, it will be taking a step towards war. When I introduced a bill in the Senate on July 18 of last year, requesting the government to declare the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, it was not intended as a prelude to a unilateral embargo. Although I oppose the embargo now, if Japan still does not respect our legitimate rights in the Far East, then this measure is not without the possibility of implementation. I hope the Japanese authorities will pay attention to this." (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Airplane "Dragon Wind" Arrives in Bangkok</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese authorities plan to inaugurate an airmail route between Tokyo and Bangkok. The Japanese airplane "Dragon Wind" departed on the 26th of this month for a trial flight and arrived in Bangkok yesterday. It is noted that the French authorities announced in December of last year that, due to the European war, they had to revoke the right for Japanese airplanes to fly over French Indochina. If Japanese airplanes do not take the route through Vietnam, the total distance will increase by 540 miles, and the route will be less safe. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and airlines are eager to reach a compromise with the French authorities to establish a landing station in Hanoi, Vietnam, which would not only shorten the journey but also increase safety. It is rumored that France's refusal to allow Japanese airplanes to fly over French Indochina is a retaliatory act for the Japanese bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. According to news from Paris, French officials deny this claim but also acknowledge that the Japanese bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway only makes all issues more difficult to resolve. In terms of climate, the most suitable time to fly from Tokyo to Bangkok is from January to May. However, between May and September, strong southwest winds are common, and in November, strong northeast winds prevail, both of which are unfavorable. In addition, the air route between the capitals of Japan and Thailand can be divided into three sections: (1) From Tokyo to Taiwan, a distance of 1,300 miles; (2) From Taiwan to Guangzhou, a distance of 520 miles; (3) From Guangzhou to Bangkok, a distance of 1,700 miles, totaling 3,520 miles. The journey can be completed in three days. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>England and Chile Sign a Commercial Agreement</h3>
<p>New York: According to Dow Jones News Agency, the Chilean Consulate General in New York announced today that the Chilean Exchange Control Commission and representatives of the British government have signed an agreement stipulating that Britain will purchase wool worth £800,000 from Chile, and Chile will use this foreign exchange to purchase British goods.

<h3>US Loan to China Expected to Pass Congress; Opinions of Members of Congress Still Highly Divided on the Capital Increase Bill for the Export-Import Bank</h3>
<p>Washington: According to news from here today, officials from the Export-Import Bank stated that the $20 million loan to China and the loan to Finland will be implemented as soon as the Congressional deliberations are completed and President Roosevelt signs the bills. They stated that China has a very good credit rating, so Congress may approve the loan to China. It is said that China aims to obtain a loan of $75 million, but this amount is beyond the capacity of the Export-Import Bank. (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Senate has already voted to pass the bill to increase the capital of the Federal Export-Import Bank by $100 million. The House of Representatives was originally scheduled to discuss the matter quickly and put it to a vote today. However, after five hours of debate, the opinions of the members of Congress are still highly divided, and it has been decided to postpone the vote until tomorrow. Some members believe that since the bill does not specifically mention providing credit to Finland, it is clearly not intended to benefit that country. Other members argue that the bill would only benefit Finland, and if it is enacted, it would set a precedent that would eventually draw the United States into the whirlpool of war, which is not advisable. In general, those members of Congress who spoke expressed sympathy for the heroic resistance of the Finnish people but have not been able to reach a conclusion, that is, whether the United States should provide loans to Finland without restricting their use. This policy has not yet been established in the House of Representatives. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>New York Air Dispatch: A reporter from the New York People's Forum observing the issue of Finland's application for a loan from the United States believes that it has failed. The reason is that President Roosevelt is unwilling to promote an understanding between the Soviet Union and Japan. "The White House and the State Department have always had many concerns about Finland's application for a loan to purchase military supplies and have ultimately refused the request. If we want to find an explanation, we must carefully examine the true nature of the relationship between the United States and Japan. According to responsible officials, the tension between the United States and Japan is more severe than the American public imagines." (Havas)</p>
<h3>American Newspaper Comments on US-Japan Trade</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Daily Mirror recently published an editorial on the commercial relationship between the United States and Japan, stating that the commercial relationship between the United States and Japan, which has now expired, was originally maintained by silk and cotton. However, the United States has a surplus of cotton, and warehouses everywhere are full. The raw silk it needs accounts for 70 percent of Japan's total production. "Japan can obtain the cotton it needs from India and Brazil, and the kerosene it needs from Mexico and Venezuela. However, the United States relies mainly on Japan for the raw silk it needs, and there is no other country that can replace it. The American silk industry, centered in New York City, employs 500,000 workers. The consumption of raw silk was 21,128 bales in December of last year, and it increased to 40,816 bales in January of this year. In January of this year, a total of 33,121 bales of raw silk were imported, of which Japan accounted for 27,020 bales, China accounted for 5,665 bales, and European countries accounted for 436 bales."

<h3>Panama Canal Defense Equipment Needs to Be Doubled</h3>
<p>New York: Yesterday, President Roosevelt inspected the defenses of the Panama Canal. On the cruiser Tuscaloosa, he told reporters that the amount of aircraft and cannons needed for the canal's extensive defenses should be doubled. President Roosevelt is now on the ship heading to Pensacola, Florida. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Welles Consults Zhou to Gauge European Political Tides; Brief Stopover in Switzerland En Route to Germany; Generally Expected to Achieve Concrete Results</h3>
<p>Rome: US Undersecretary of State Welles, representing President Roosevelt to tour Europe and review the overall situation, departed from Rome after midnight to Berlin. Mussolini sent a letter to Welles, warmly inviting him to visit Rome again on his return trip to the United States. Welles told reporters that his mission was to "gauge the depth and currents of the European political sea." He expressed his pleasure at the warm welcome in Rome but denied that he was carrying any proposals from President Roosevelt to any European government. Welles also remained silent on the results of his talks in Rome. Diplomatic and political figures believe that "unless Welles does miraculous work in London, Berlin, and Paris," he will not have any actions to end the war when he returns to Washington. However, it is believed that the general hope that Welles' trip will produce valuable concrete results is well-founded, so public interest in Welles' mission remains high. It is said that the letter President Roosevelt carried to Mussolini was a personal letter introducing Welles. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Rome: US Undersecretary of State Welles left here last night for Zurich, Switzerland, to go to Berlin to study the war situation and hopes for peace. He was accompanied by his private secretary. Officials from the American Embassy here escorted Welles to the train station. Before departing, Welles told reporters that he could not announce the content of his talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. He said, "Regarding my talks with Mussolini, I always refer to President Roosevelt's statements that my responsibility is to report to the President on the European situation during my travels in Italy, Germany, and England. My report will be strictly confidential. I do not represent the United States in making any suggestions or promises. I am naturally in contact with the State Department. I am very grateful for the kindness of the Italian government, and I feel that the talks were very beneficial." (United Press, 28th)</p>
<p>Rome: US Secretary of State Welles left for Zurich, Switzerland, at 12:15 AM this morning, so that he may go to Berlin tomorrow. The secretary of the US Embassy in Germany, Rahlmanson, came here from Berlin yesterday to greet him and also went to Germany with him today. When departing, Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Chief of Protocol Celesia and many American dignitaries were at the station to see him off. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Sends Letter to the Pope, Willing to Jointly Strive for Peace from a Religious and Humanitarian Perspective</h3>
<p>Vatican: President Roosevelt sent a letter to the Pope, mentioning Myron Taylor's appointment as his personal representative to the Vatican, stating that he hoped that Taylor would be a link for both parties to exchange views in order to seek harmony among the people of the world. He has instructed Taylor to pay his respects to the Holy See, and he hopes that the common views on religion and humanity can be expressed in a common path to establish a more lasting peace based on freedom and safety of life and the integrity of all countries under God's protection.

<h3>Rumor of Hitler's Proposed Peace Plan; Germany Rejects British Newspaper's False Claims</h3>
<p>Berlin: Hamburg's "Foreign Review" has a good relationship with Goering. Because the "Daily Telegraph," the mouthpiece of the British military, published slanderous remarks yesterday, the newspaper's editorial today made the following defense: It is claimed that the "Daily Telegraph" stated that Hitler would give Welles a draft peace plan when Welles was hired in Berlin, and it was stated that the plan included three main points: (1) Germany is prepared to establish a new Polish state; (2) Grant administrative autonomy to the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia; (3) Germany will participate in a disarmament conference, etc. All of which are inaccurate. We understand the meaning of this kind of slander. In short, the fact that Britain and France have been at war with Germany for six months, and military actions and blockade measures on the sea, land, and air have failed to win, is a fact known to the people of Britain and France. As public sentiment declines, the opportunity of Welles' visit is used to spread rumors to boost the morale of Britain and France. (Haitong News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Shanghai West District Police Affairs Negotiation Raised for Discussion in British House of Commons; Butler Reports on Progress</h3>
<p>London: Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today during a discussion of the Shanghai extraterritorial roads issue that, according to recent reports, the criminal situation in the Shanghai West District extraterritorial road area is still very bad. However, the Japanese authorities have expressed their intention to eliminate some gambling dens and sources of crime. Such gambling dens, etc., are the main causes of disorder in the area. Since the signing of the temporary agreement on police affairs on extraterritorial roads, the Japanese Consul General has issued a public statement stating that the Japanese authorities are prepared to continue negotiations on police affairs in Hongkou and other areas north of the Suzhou Creek. In fact, both sides have already started these talks, and it is hoped that other outstanding issues regarding the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council in the aforementioned areas can be resolved. Conservative Party member Milner asked Butler whether he would express his gratitude to the Japanese side for the practical actions they planned and promote the implementation of this work to the extent possible. Butler replied that he would very much like to see this action. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<h3>Britain Considers Establishing a Contraband Control Zone in Vladivostok to Prevent German-Soviet Freight</h3>
<p>London: British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross made a shocking announcement to the House of Commons yesterday, stating that Britain is considering establishing a contraband control zone in the Vladivostok area to prevent the Soviet Union from importing goods to Germany. This document can be interpreted as an increase in British-Soviet friction. This plan will increase the work of the British Navy in the North Pacific. The British Navy will manage the shipment of tin, rubber and other raw materials to the Soviet Union. (United Press, 28th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Warships Again Detain British Ships Outside Wenzhou; Two Ships Released, Two Still Detained; Japanese Warships Fire on British Ship Outside Yantai</h3>
<p>Since Japanese warships hindered foreign ships from sailing to Wenzhou, shipping on the Shanghai-Wenzhou route has been greatly affected. However, in order to facilitate the transportation of goods, shipping companies continue to operate. According to information from the New Voice News Agency, the British ships "Joseph," "Tongshun," and "Daxin" recently sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai and were again intercepted by a Japanese destroyer outside Wenzhou.</p>
<p>Three Motorboats Prevented Progress</p>
<p>At that time, the warship was anchored at the mouth of the Yanpan River. When it saw three ships sailing from the Oujiang River, it launched three motorboats and approached the ships to prevent them from proceeding. At the same time, the Japanese warship used signal flags to order them to anchor. The shipowners stopped sailing to avoid accidents. The Japanese army then boarded the ships and demanded inspection. The shipowners refused without success.</p>
<p>Repeated Negotiations Result in Release of Two Ships</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the Japanese army lingered under the guise of inspection, effectively placing the foreign ships under house arrest for a day and night. After repeated negotiations by the shipowners, the "Joseph" and "Tongshun" were released the night before and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The "Daxin" has not yet been released.</p>
<p>No News of the Yongtai Ship</p>
<p>It is also learned that there is still one ship, the "Yongtai," which telegraphed the night before that it would be able to come to Shanghai soon, but it has not arrived yet yesterday. It is feared that it was intercepted by a Japanese warship en route. The British ship "Mary Moller" sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou last Friday, taking six days to arrive. It was not until yesterday that it telegraphed to Shanghai, saying that it had arrived in Wenzhou on the evening of the 27th. The other ships, "Xinan Na," "Yonghua," "Xinan Tong," and "Xinan Li," have not continued to sail since returning to Shanghai last week due to the difficulty of sailing on the route. Whether they will sail to Wenzhou again will depend on the situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Fires on Hunan</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that yesterday (the 27th) at 5:00 PM, news broadcast from London said that the Swire Company's "Hunan" was intercepted by a Japanese warship outside Yantai. However, the interception procedure was unusual: the Japanese warship fired a solid small cannonball, which mistakenly hit the British ship. The Japanese government quickly apologized for the error and promised compensation. It is now believed that the matter has been resolved.</p>
<h3>Fessenden Not Resigning; Yesterday's News Reports Inaccurate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, some newspapers reported that Fessenden, the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, had expressed his intention to resign, which aroused great concern from all parties, both Chinese and foreign. Because Mr. Fessenden has been well-received since taking office, all sectors of society deeply hope that he will shoulder the arduous task. Yesterday, foreign reporters specially interviewed Mr. Fessenden on this matter. According to Mr. Fessenden's reply, "I have not submitted my resignation, nor do I intend to resign," confirming that the rumor was inaccurate.</p>
<h3>General Electric Strike Quickly Settled</h3>
<p>Resumed Normal Work Yesterday</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that workers at the General Electric Company on Route Robert Sivel (sic) went on strike last night, locking the gates and preventing anyone from entering or leaving. Marine Corps personnel arrived after receiving the news and issued a notice. Five minutes later, they threw smoke bombs outside the gate to disperse the strikers inside the gate. The time was 8:30 PM. A person climbed over the gate to unlock it. In less than an hour, the police had resolved the strike. The factory resumed normal work today (the 28th).</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Public Works Department Strike Not Yet Resolved</h3>
<p>2,500 Strikers; Disturbances Occurred in Several Places Yesterday</p>
<p>Several hundred workers in the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council joined the 2,000 workers who had already gone on strike last week and went on strike together. The police department received reports of disturbances in several places. Some workers pushing manure carts, who were not on strike, were attacked by strikers yesterday, causing great annoyance and inconvenience to the public.</p>
<p>One of the disturbances occurred on Gansu Road near Suzhou Creek, when a manure cart was pushed into the river by rioters. Another incident occurred on Muirhead Road, where the manure in the cart was</p>
<p>Dumped on the ground by the strikers. The police department did not make any arrests. The total number of strikers has now reached 2,500, most of whom are road repair workers. The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" also reported that thousands of workers in the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>Went on strike demanding rice subsidies. Although the Municipal Council agreed to increase their wages appropriately, the strikers demanded higher wages and rejected the new subsidies offered by the Municipal Council, resulting in disturbances such as dumping manure on the ground this morning (the 28th). However, there were no major riots, because the strikers dispersed as soon as they saw the police arriving. The incidents caused by the strikers today include (1) dismantling two wheels of a manure cart on Muirhead Road, causing manure to flow all over the road; (2) throwing a manure cart into the river at the manure station on Gansu Road in the West Hongkou District; (3) and throwing several manure carts into the river at the manure station in the Zhabei District. Other incidents of breaking cleaning brushes also occurred in several other places.</p>
<h3>"New Police Force" Issue; Meeting Last Night</h3>
<p>Regarding the meeting to discuss the details of the "Special Police Force" on the Shanghai West District extraterritorial roads, according to Article 2 of the agreement, both parties should discuss the details by the police authorities. Yesterday at 6:00 PM, a joint meeting was held at the Broadway Mansions in Hongkou, convened by Fu Xiao'an. The Municipal Council Police was represented by Police Commissioner Bowen and Japanese Deputy Police Commissioner Akaki Chikayuki. The "Great Way Municipal Government" was represented by Lu Ying and Japanese advisor Colonel Igarashi Minoru.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Request; General Post Office Replied</h3>
<p>Approved Rice Subsidy as per Kunming Precedent</p>
<p>Three months after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai Post Office implemented salary cuts, initially paying 60% of salaries. Although it has since improved, salaries are still paid at 80% to this day. The employees of the post office are deeply aware of the difficulty of maintaining their livelihoods under the pressure of the skyrocketing prices in the city and have repeatedly requested the authorities to restore full salaries, which has not been approved. All employees then submitted two requests to the authorities in December of last year: (1) When the price of rice exceeds 30 yuan, the excess amount will be subsidized by the authorities; (2) Relief subsidies will be issued according to 10% of salaries. The above two requests were submitted to the authorities by the association, and Director Cha urgently forwarded them to the General Post Office. It is now learned that a reply has been received from the General Post Office, approving the issuance of rice subsidies according to the Kunming precedent. Employees of post offices in the Shanghai area will also receive appropriate subsidies. However, the request to issue a 10% relief subsidy has not been approved. It is heard that Director Cha has promised to continue to strive for it on behalf of the employees, so that the employees' livelihoods can be maintained.</p>
<h3>Post Office Recruiting Postal Assistants; Women Allowed to Participate</h3>
<p>This time, the Shanghai Postal Administration is recruiting postal assistants for the Jiangsu and Anhui postal districts. The only restriction on women is that married women are not allowed to apply for the examination. Since registration began on the 26th, many people have been enthusiastically registering, and women account for a part of them.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Sympathetic to China; Japanese Side Pays Great Attention; Even Mentions Franco-Japanese Friendship; Miura Once Sent a Letter Inquiring of Mr. Baudic</h3>
<p>French Ambassador to China Cossé gave a speech at the China-France-Belgium-Switzerland Cultural Association in Chongqing on the 25th. According to reports, his speech stated that "China and France are currently in the same position, that is, both are fighting against aggressors, so they must help each other." Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy told foreign reporters that if this news is true, it will affect Franco-Japanese friendship. It is learned that Japanese Consul General Miura sent a letter to French Consul General in Shanghai Baudic for this purpose, but no reply has been received so far.

<h3>Taxes in the French Concession Will Not Increase Temporarily; Increased by 20% Since January This Year; Expected Not to Continue to Increase in July</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Public Concession is about to increase taxes. Yesterday (the 27th), a reporter asked an official of the French Municipal Council whether the French Concession plans to increase taxes in July. The reply was that, as far as is known at present, the French Concession is not expected to continue to increase taxes in July. It is noted that taxes in the French Concession were 13% in 1937 and increased to 15% from January 1, 1939. However, on December 29 of the same year, the Municipal Council, in view of the outbreak of war in Europe, decided to add an additional 20% surcharge from January 1 of this year, totaling 17%. This additional 20% defense surcharge is remitted to France.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fruits Dumped in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Exports to Europe and the United States Sharply Reduced; Efforts to Import to Shanghai Increased</p>
<p>The "Central Market" organized by the Japanese side originally intended to control vegetables, local products, fruits, and other goods. However, due to opposition from various industries concerned, the opening date has now been postponed. However, before the "Market" starts, the Japanese side is still extremely meticulous about fruits, suppressing imports while trying to sell Japanese products as much as possible. It has been learned that because of the difficulty of exporting Japanese fruits to Europe and the sharp decline in trade with the South Seas and the Americas, they have had no choice but to increase their efforts to import and dump them in Shanghai, China, hoping to make up for the decline in fruit trade with various countries around the world. The Japanese fruit industry has jointly formed the "Fresh Fruit Export Association," specializing in managing fruit trade with China. Recently, Japanese transport ships sailing from Japan to Shanghai have been fully loaded with large quantities of Japanese "apples" and "pears" arriving in port. Their cost is lower than that of Chinese fruits, so their selling price is slightly lower, attracting various fruit merchants to sell them on their behalf. However, buyers can distinguish them by the color of the fruit skin.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Leaders Give Farewell Dinner for American Consul General</h3>
<p>Gauss About to Go to Australia</p>

<p>Noodle Businesses Resumed Operations Yesterday</p>
<p>There were originally over 300 noodle businesses in the city, mostly run by people from Hubei, operating on a small scale. Due to the unavailability of flour, the businesses collectively decided to suspend operations from the 26th. Now, the Noodle Business Association, urgently in need of assistance, had Chairman Luo Haitao submit a special petition to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, outlining their difficulties and requesting solutions. The Chamber then sent a letter of introduction to the Shanghai Municipal Council, requesting assistance similar to that provided to the noodle-cutting industry. Deputy Secretary Ho of the Shanghai Municipal Council has agreed to the request, and 184 registered businesses will each receive two bags of flour directly from the flour mills daily. The distribution began yesterday, the 28th, with collection at the Yuang Feng Flour Mill on Nanyang Bridge. These businesses resumed operations yesterday. As for businesses operating on roads beyond the settlement limits that have not yet registered, they have begun the process of registering for the second round of flour distribution.</p>

<h3>Restoration and Construction Public Bonds - Principal and Interest Repayment</h3>
<p>The eighth repayment of principal and interest on the 25th Year of the Republic Restoration Public Bonds. After the National Debt Fund Committee and the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China) agreed on a method for discounting and paying, the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China has been ordered to begin payments today jointly with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. Those holding winning bonds and matured coupons should first fill out a discount application. In Shanghai, payments will be made in six installments, each lasting one month, with applicable drafts issued. As for the fourth principal and interest repayment of the first issuance of the third-period Railway Construction Public Bonds, and the third principal and interest repayment of the second issuance, the Ministry of Finance has allocated subsidies, and the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China will make full payments starting today. However, these bonds are mostly in the hands of banks, with few circulating in the market. Furthermore, the ninth principal repayment of the Category B bonds of the 25th Year of the Republic Unified Public Bonds, and the twenty-second principal repayment of the 17th Year of the Republic Long-Term Financial Public Bonds, are scheduled for a lottery at 10 AM on March 9th.

<h3>British Shanghai Public Omnibus Company - Coppersmiths Request Pay Raise - Submitted Eight Demands to Company Authorities - No Response as of 10 PM Last Night</h3>
<p>In the Shanghai Public Omnibus Company's Shanghai West Kangding Road depot, besides the drivers and conductors on the buses, there are also 450 coppersmiths employed. Their duties include not only repairing bus parts but also cleaning the bus bodies, glass windows, and adding oil daily, so the work is quite heavy. Since the sharp increase in prices last year, the company authorities had granted some subsidies at the request of the employees, but the amount was limited, and prices continued to rise sharply, doubling in the past three months. As a result, the additional subsidies received by the general employees were still insufficient to make ends meet. Therefore, all the coppersmiths in the factory jointly submitted a petition on the 14th of this month, requesting the company authorities to provide further assistance and demanding a public response by 10 AM yesterday, the 28th. However, the company authorities believed that no further increases could be made, so they did not accept it. The employees, on the other hand, believed that the company's business was booming and that granting their requests would not only not harm the company's interests but would also be reasonable. Therefore, after 10 AM yesterday morning, they elected representatives to request the company authorities to provide a formal written response by 4 PM yesterday, to meet public expectations. However, no news came at that time. Therefore, all the coppersmiths first went on strike and demanded that the company consider their difficult situation, accept their requests, and respond by 10 PM that night. Unfortunately, no results were achieved by then. Therefore, the coppersmiths went on strike and formally proposed eight demands, including a 40% wage increase, increased rice subsidies, and no dismissal of employees, requesting the company authorities to adopt them. According to reporters, the company authorities are said to respond to the coppersmiths' requests at 10 AM today, the 29th.</p>
<p>The eight demands are reportedly: (1) Increase wages by 40%; (2) Increase rice subsidies to 15 yuan per month; (3) Restore the same treatment for new and old employees in terms of annual bonuses (i.e., an additional 24 days' wages per person per year); (4) Require the company authorities to formally recognize the Coppersmiths' Union; (5) In the event of an employee's work-related death, the company will allocate a compensation fee of 1,000 yuan; (6) Restore rest on Sundays and holidays, otherwise, double wages should be paid; (7) Company employees ride company vehicles for free, and no fees should be charged; (8) No dismissal of employees without cause.</p>
<h3>Extension of Coal Briquette Voucher Delivery - Mass Sale to Start Tomorrow - Fair Price Committee Established - Investigation for Delayed Voucher Delivery</h3>
<p>The entire fuel problem in Shanghai is being monopolized and manipulated, resulting in a shortage of spot goods and soaring market prices, which poses a serious threat to ordinary people. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a prominent figure in the business community, have repeatedly sent letters to various fuel industry associations, strongly urging them to find ways to suppress market prices, crack down on illegal transactions in the market, and separately wrote to the authorities of the two concessions, requesting them to plan to dredge the source. Now, the fair-price sale of coal briquettes will begin tomorrow for a period of 20 days, with a limit of 2 jiao (1 jiao equals 1/10 yuan), or 4 catties (1 catty equals 1.1 pounds), per person. A fair-price coal briquette committee was established yesterday. The cooked-water industry has received more than 300 tons of fair-price coal, and the selling price of cooked water is being planned. The detailed information is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Meeting: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in view of the soaring coal prices that affect the livelihood of ordinary people, although the market prices of coal blocks, coal briquettes, firewood, and charcoal have gradually trended downstream, the fundamental solution remains to be resolved. In order to address the root cause, a joint meeting of representatives from the three associations of coal, coal briquette, and firewood and charcoal industries was convened yesterday at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club, with Yu Qiaqing elected as chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, the soaring coal prices, the livelihood of ordinary people, and the relationship to security within the boundaries. The representatives of the two parties stated the key issues of soaring coal prices and contributed to suppressing the methods. The discussion then began, and the meeting adjourned until about 4 pm.</p>
<p>The results of the fuel industry joint meeting yesterday are as follows: (1) Extension of voucher delivery for 15 days, from March 1 to March 15, passed by resolution; (2) Organization of the Fair Price Coal Briquette Committee, passed unanimously by resolution, and the following members were appointed: (A) Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representatives: Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, Xu Jilong, Yan Esheng; (B) Coal Industry Association representatives: Wei Zida, Bao Zhexing, Lu Qisheng; (C) Coal Briquette Industry Association representatives: Chen Cuifang, Qian Yaonan, You Chunxin, He Ziguo, Han Pihao; (D) Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association representatives: Ni Baizhai, Wang Zhusheng, Zhou Changchun, totaling 15 people; (3) No new vouchers will be issued, and it has been resolved by the Coal Industry Association and unanimously approved. The Fair Price Coal Briquette Committee is scheduled to convene its first committee meeting at the Bank Club at 4 PM this afternoon to determine the location of the fair price and all procedures.</p>
<p>Investigation of Vouchers: The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce received letters yesterday from 16 coal companies, including Xie Taixing, Yongda, Kunyuanxing, Qinda, Zhang Kunhe, Ruitai, and Shengda, stating that the failure of voucher holders to deliver the stored goods was caused by the factories, so the holders should not only not bear the storage rent, but the factories should also bear the compensation for the losses of the voucher holders, and specially requested to investigate the facts and forward them to the Coal Briquette Association to inform the factories to increase production as soon as possible, hand over the voucher stock, and provide as much as possible for separate sales. The Chamber of Commerce replied, "It has been repeatedly ordered by the Chamber of Commerce to the Coal Briquette Association to supervise the industry to increase production as much as possible in order to achieve supply and demand balance. As for whether the voucher holders are currently delivering the goods on time, and the failure of the factories to deliver the goods, no reports have been received from the voucher holders. There are only three days left until the deadline. If this is the case, please list the voucher numbers, account names, quantities, and factory names one by one for investigation. It is extremely important. However, it is rumored that many new vouchers have been secretly filled in since the deadline for delivery. It seems that it is too late to stop it now."</p>
<h3>Anti-Smoking and Drinking Campaign - City Federation Responds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Savings and Disaster Relief Committee believes that smoking and drinking not only waste money but also harm health. At a time when prices are high and life is difficult, it is essential to eliminate them. It is advocating an anti-smoking and drinking campaign. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation responded to this campaign yesterday and notified the district branches to implement it unanimously. The notice stated briefly that smoking and drinking stimulate nerves and harm health the most. At this time of high prices, everyone should resolutely abstain from this unnecessary consumption. The Savings and Disaster Relief Committee launched the anti-smoking and drinking campaign, which is extremely important. Therefore, a special notice is issued, hoping to widely persuade citizens to implement it unanimously, which is what is hoped for.</p>
<h3>British Public Bus Company - New Substitute Vouchers Issued Again</h3>
<p>February Vouchers - Discontinued from Today</p>
<p>The British-owned China General Omnibus Company's February substitute vouchers will be discontinued from today. A new type of yellow hard-quality substitute voucher was specially issued yesterday, printed with the words "In order to facilitate passengers, this voucher is specially issued, priced at 20 cents, and can only be used as a fare on the company's vehicles, valid until June 30, 1940." Each conductor is given 200 sheets per shift (totaling 4 yuan) as change. However, since the circulation of 20 cent denomination notes is quite extensive, the substitute vouchers have not entered the market.</p>
<h3>Tea Server Accidentally Discharges Firearm</h3>
<p>Shen Arong, a tea server at the Lianyi Gambling Den Entertainment Club at the intersection of Kangding Road and Yanping Road in Shanghai's West District, accidentally discharged a firearm while playing with a handgun at the foot of the stage around 10 PM the night before. The bullet hit his lower abdomen, and his life is said to be in critical condition.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Office Interpretation - Problem of Supplementary Dividends from Previous Year - Should Be Included in This Year's Income</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce notified the various industry associations yesterday, stating, "Dear Sirs, We have recently received a letter from the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance stating that your association's letter regarding whether a company's lack of profits in the 27th year of the Republic but profits in the 28th year, in addition to paying official interest for that year, still has surplus to pay the unpaid official interest of the 27th year, violates item 17 of the Category 1 Profit Income Tax Collection Notice, which states that the loss of business in the previous year may not be included in the calculation of this year, and requested your office to investigate and reply. The Office approved this. According to item 14 of the Category 1 Income Tax Collection Notice, the following items cannot be considered necessary and reasonable expenses and losses in business. If the taxpayer lists them as expenses, they should be removed when calculating net profit. (1) Interest on capital, etc. When calculating the amount of income, business enterprises are not allowed to deduct dividends in advance. Therefore, if the surplus of this year is used to pay the dividends of the previous year, it will not actually have any impact on the calculation of income tax. However, for profit enterprises organized as companies, since Article 171 of the Company Law stipulates that companies may not distribute dividends without making up for losses, they must have made up for losses before paying supplementary dividends, which is inconsistent with item 17 of the Category 1 Income Tax Collection Notice. The amount of this supplementary dividend and the amount of losses made up should still be included in this year's</p>
<p>calculation of income. We hereby reply accordingly, hoping that you will check this matter and forward it to your affiliated industries for reference and implementation. We look forward to your cooperation."</p>

<h3>Indeed a "Paper Tiger" - Gambling Dens Still Allowed to Operate - Gambling Den Owners Agree to Increase Substantial Donations and Taxes - Japanese Authorities Actually Protect in Every Possible Way</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Japanese side ordered the gambling dens in Shanghai's West District to close within a month, which has now become a "paper tiger" situation. The villainous gambling den owner, Shi Gongwei, used both threats and bribes to indefinitely postpone the closure order. According to reliable sources, the gambling den owner has convinced the Japanese authorities in charge of these evil places that there is no "goose that lays the golden eggs" until the agreement on roads beyond the settlement limits is implemented. Some sources even say that the gambling den owner's methods are very effective, causing the negotiations on the agreement on roads beyond the settlement limits to be suspended again. The "Entertainment Salt Supervisory Office" collects donations from each gambling den every month, which originally amounted to a huge sum of one million yuan. However, it is said that in order to postpone the closure order, the gambling den owner has agreed to increase this donation. On the other hand, he condoned his armed thugs to commit crimes in the Shanghai's West District, using this to warn the authorities that if they cut off their "lifeline," the situation in the Shanghai's West District will become even worse. It is said that in the past two weeks, robberies on buses and roads in the Shanghai's West District have also been committed by these thugs. It is also said that the Japanese authorities have allowed the gambling dens to continue operating, and the new conditions implemented are as follows: (1) The gambling dens should do their best to prevent shootings and conflicts from happening, so as not to cause public outcry; (2) The gambling dens should use dance halls, hotels, theaters, or bars as a cover to conceal the truth; (3) The gambling dens must avoid using electric torch signs to attract attention. In short, unless unexpected events such as a direct order from Tokyo occur, the gambling dens will continue to exist.</p>
<h3>Rampant Gambling Disasters in Shanghai's South District</h3>
<p>In addition to the prevalence of Huahui gambling in various places in Shanghai's South District, various gambling dens are springing up like mushrooms after rain. The Japanese puppet regime seems to have tacitly approved and openly called for them. There are already as many as six gambling dens that have opened, including Heng'an Company on Nanyang Bridge, Xingfa Company on Wengjia Lane in the Old West Gate, Xieli Company, Shengsheng Company in Pinhua Lane on Anren Street inside the New North Gate, Shixing Company on Fuyou Road, and Xieji Company on Qingyun Street, Niumudi. At the same time, there are two huge gambling dens that are being prepared and will be opened soon, one is Erxin Company at No. 501 Mingguo Road, hosted by Fan, and the other is Dafu Company at No. 725 Zhaojia Road inside Kaoxi Gate, hosted by Gao. There are also Dali Company at No. 31 Xima Street inside Fangbang Bridge, Huasen Company at No. 89 Baoren Lane on Anren Street inside the New North Gate, Fadaer Company on Gaodun Lane, Niumudi, Erlai Company at No. 196 Luxiangyuan Road, Liyuan Club in Jihe Lane, No. 27 Wengjia Lane, and Rongsheng Company in Xiangzheng Lane, No. 141 Jufang Lane, Old West Gate, which are being decorated and will be opened on a selected day. It is difficult to investigate those preparing to open. The future disasters are unimaginable. However, if all citizens restrain themselves and do not move forward, they will inevitably reduce themselves in a short time.</p>
<h3>Late Spring Cold</h3>
<p>Spring Snow Falling in Shanghai - Low Pressure System Has Passed Shanghai</p>
<p>In the past two days, the spring cold has been severe in Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon, starting at 1:00 PM, spring snow was falling, and it had not stopped by the evening. It melted as it fell, and there was no accumulation. It has been found that spring snow is particularly unfavorable to agricultural work and will show farmland pests, affecting spring plowing.</p>
<p>Due to the movement of the low-pressure system to the northeast-east, the weather in Shanghai was quite bad. Since the afternoon of the 27th, strong gusts of wind have swept through Shanghai, and the temperature has dropped sharply to about 5 degrees Celsius. Since yesterday morning, the low-pressure system has crossed the Shanghai border and entered the East China Sea, and the wind has subsided. However, the minimum temperature is still only 4 degrees Celsius. Although the rain has stopped, the sky is still very gloomy.</p>
<h3>Liu Zhongying Shot and Killed - Suspect Escorted to Court Yesterday - After a Brief Trial, Ordered to Be Detained for Another Week for Further Investigation</h3>
<p>Liu Zhongying, a native of Ningbo, has served as a member of the executive committee of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, a staff member of the citizens' group of the Shanghai Refugee Association, and a member of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association. The Daya Radio Station at No. 545 Huayao Lane, Jiujiang Road, was also run by Liu. At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, Liu left the Daya Radio Station, intending to go to the Yudechi Bathhouse on Nanjing Road. As he was walking out of Huawan Lane, two men suddenly stepped forward, each with a handgun, blocking Liu's path. One of them fired two shots at Liu, both of which hit him. One bullet hit Liu's throat, and the other hit his chest. He immediately fell to the ground injured. Nearby constables who heard the alarm rushed to the scene and arrested Xiao Yongming (22 years old, resident of No. 25, Lane 80, Beidiqian Road), another man who was acting as a lookout. They also seized a new-style "lotus root" handgun loaded with five bullets and found 34 bullets in Xiao's pocket. He was taken back to the police station along with the handgun and bullets. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. The police authorities requested that the defendant be temporarily detained pending further investigation. After review by the American judge, Xiao Yongming was ordered to be detained for one week. After Liu was injured, he died due to the severity of his injuries. The body was inspected by the prosecutor of the First Special District Court and ordered to be coffined. The reason for Liu's murder is rumored to be diverse, but according to general observation, it was a vendetta.</p>
<p>Funeral Today: After Liu Zhongying, a member of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession and a member of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, was tragically assassinated, his remains were moved to the Continental Funeral Home on Haige Road yesterday. The funeral is scheduled for 2:00 PM today.</p>
<h3>Woman Cao Zhao Sues for Support - Wins Case</h3>
<p>Cao Zhao, a woman from Ningbo, 31 years old this year, married Cao Sizhong, the young master of Yida Paper Shop on Lao Yong'an Street, through a matchmaker in the 21st year of the Republic. Since their marriage, they have had a son named Haixiang, who is now seven years old. The love between the couple was still considered harmonious. Unexpectedly, good times did not last long. Four years ago, Cao Sizhong suddenly went to his ancestral home in Huizhou and changed his original intention from then on. He actually found a new lover outside, ignoring his original wife. Her living expenses were paid monthly by Cao's father, Weiheng. Recently, Cao Weiheng also stopped paying her living expenses, so she hired lawyer Zhu Hefu to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Cao Weiheng and Cao Sizhong for support and education expenses. After receiving the complaint, the court, with Judge Li Liang presiding, opened Civil Court 7 for trial. The plaintiff requested the court to award her 20,000 yuan for support and 10,000 yuan for education expenses, for a total of 30,000 yuan. The court said that the defendants could not be located, so they completed the debate by appointing a proxy. The verdict was announced yesterday morning: The defendants should pay the plaintiff 60 yuan per month for living expenses and 25 yuan for education expenses. The litigation costs will be borne by the defendants.</p>
<h3>Frequent Kidnappings in Shanghai's West District - Young Son of Wealthy Merchant Kidnapped - Still Missing</h3>
<p>Recently, kidnappings have occurred frequently in Shanghai's West District. The day before yesterday, a kidnapping occurred again in Yongle Village near Caojiabo on Route de Zikawei. The victim was a three-year-old child, so the nature of the case is believed to be extortion. The wealthy Ying family, residing at No. 6 Yongle Village, was getting up to wash around 8:00 AM the day before yesterday. Their three-year-old son was being breastfed by a nanny when several men broke into the house. They were all armed and silenced the family. They snatched the child from the nanny's arms, rushed out of the door, and ran into a car parked at the entrance of Yongle Village Lane, speeding away. Mr. Ying reported to the nearby "puppet police station," and the "puppet police" were sent to investigate the case, but the child's whereabouts are still unknown.</p>
<h3>Fraternal Strife - Zhu Xiaonan Acquitted - Plaintiff's Incidental Civil Suit Also Dismissed</h3>
<p>The late traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Zhu Nanshan had two sons, Xiaonan (the elder) and He Gao (the younger). Both inherited their father's profession and practiced medicine at their self-built residence at No. 96 Ai Youyi Road and Changsha Road intersection. Their daily earnings from consultations were distributed and recorded equally according to the contract. However, recently, a rift suddenly developed between the Zhu brothers, leading to fraternal strife.</p>
<p>Fraternal strife: Zhu He Gao first filed a lawsuit against his elder brother, Xiaonan, in the Civil Division of the First Special Court for clearing accounts. Then, he reported his accountant Shen Wendou and Zhu Xiaonan to the police for criminal breach of trust and embezzlement of 201 yuan and 5 jiao in consultation fees. This case has been repeatedly tried by Judge Xiao Peishen of the First Special Court. The defendant Zhu Xiaonan hired lawyer Hong Shihao to appear in court. In addition to making every effort to defend himself, he also submitted</p>
<p>supplemental reasons. His words were thousands of words long. In addition to thoroughly analyzing the details of the case, his conclusion focused on human relations and the world, stating that the defendant Zhu Xiaonan and the plaintiff's father Zhu Nanshan had been bedridden for many years before his death. As the eldest son, the defendant was in charge of the family, and all matters inside and outside the family were handled by the defendant. He was responsible for financial income and expenditure. The bones of the deceased father were not yet cold, and as a fellow compatriot, he did not hesitate to file this unannounced lawsuit. Who has no family in the world? Who has no siblings? If this trend continues, what etiquette and morals will our Chinese descendants have? What families in the country will not be chaotic? At a time when the world is declining and getting worse, it is necessary for the law to correct this. He should be declared innocent. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao ascended the criminal</p>
<p>court and announced the verdict: Shen Wendou and Zhu Xiaonan were innocent. The incidental civil suit, the plaintiff's lawsuit, was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Lu Dacheng Sues Aunt</h3>
<p>For Embezzling More Than 600 Mu of Sand Land - Defendant Claims It Was a Gift from Biological Mother</p>
<p>Shi Lu Jingyun, the wife of Chongming's wealthy gentleman Lu Weicheng (resident of No. 215 Fuli Road, French Concession), was recently sued in the Second Special Court by her nephew Lu Dacheng (26 years old, Guanghua University student, resident of No. 4 Xuehua Lane, Xuehuali Road), represented by lawyer Ge Zhiqin,</p>
<p>for embezzlement. The reason for the case is that the defendant Shi Lu Jingyun is applying evidence of immovable property possession and jewelry. In addition to requesting punishment in accordance with the law, she is also submitting a civil suit requesting the return of the evidence and clothing. It has been found that the plaintiff inherited all the assets of his deceased father, Jianchang, and discovered that some key documents were missing, including Chongming Ping'an Sand Land, two qing one mu and three hao, and the seal of Qidong Yongfeng Sand Land, four qing 97 mu and six fen. The household registration books</p>
<p>were searched everywhere but could not be found. After detailed investigation with the grain counters of each county, it was found that the fields in Chongming, Qidong, and other places had been changed to the name of Shi Lu Jingyun. It has been found that the defendant Shi Lu Jingyun is the plaintiff's aunt, namely the daughter of Lu Sunshi, the concubine of the plaintiff's grandfather Nianqiao. Lu Sunshi was the plaintiff's step-grandmother. When the plaintiff's step-grandmother was alive, she often lived in the defendant's house, so she took the valuable jewelry and</p>
<p>business documents to the defendant's house and handed them over to the defendant for safekeeping. After the death of the plaintiff's step-grandmother, the defendant held the documents in his possession and claimed that the plaintiff's step-grandmother had debts before her death, and the plaintiff had to pay off the debts before the items could be returned. The plaintiff had no choice but to pay, but the defendant still embezzled the above-mentioned fields. The court should summon the defendant to the court and punish him for embezzlement. The court approved the complaint. Yesterday, Judge Wu summoned the parties for trial. The defendant commissioned a</p>
<p>lawyer to appear and claimed that the two sand lands in Chongming and Qidong were given to the defendant by Lu Sunshi and there is evidence to prove it. He asked the court to allow a postponement. Today, the defendant is sick and did not attend, so the evidence could not be collected. After reviewing the situation, the court instructed to wait for a postponement of the trial.</p>
<h3>Tram Passenger Falls from Tram and Dies; Ticket Seller Charged with Negligence</h3>
<p>Wu Xuegao, a Jiangbei native working as ticket seller number 1102 on the number 16 trolleybus, on the afternoon of the 19th of this month at 8 PM, while selling tickets on tram B39, opened the tram door approximately 30 yards away from the station at the location of Avenue Road and Maybark Road, allowing passenger Xu Yongyi to jump off, resulting in Xu's injury and death. The police believed that Wu Xuegao was suspected of causing death due to negligence, so they arrested and detained him for investigation. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special Court No. 1 and prosecuted for the crime of causing death due to negligence. The defendant hired lawyer Jiang Ping for defense. Judge Xiao Peishen presided over the trial, which concluded with the order for Wu to be detained and a judgment scheduled for March 4.</p>

<h3>A Sick Man's Sorrow in Spring</h3>
<p>Spring arrives, and flowers are about to bloom, how should a loving couple arrange their affairs?</p>
<p>Only because of impotence and weakness, precious youth is wasted!</p>
<p>Wasting youth, this is the saddest thing! Because how much youth does a person have in life? We barely have time to cherish it, how can we allow it to be wasted? Therefore, it is said, "Pluck the flower when it is time to pluck, don't wait until there are no flowers and break the branch in vain." Adult men and women, when they have the opportunity and vitality to talk about love, they must enjoy the happiness of love, which is what life should be about. But true love must be based on health. Vitality is what I mean. If a man has committed self-pollution and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has indulged in sex in early marriage, or has suffered from excessive worry and labor, depleting the endocrine fluid in his reproductive glands, or has damaged his sexual nerves, then impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency and infertility, back pain, neurasthenia, premature aging, and other symptoms will be endless. Such a sick man, even with a flower-like lover, will not have a fulfilling marital life on a beautiful spring night, or it will be like a flash in the pan, or even a failure, unable to perform his conjugal duty. How can this not arouse the hatred of his wife? In this world, many couples have their love broken because of this, leading to tragedies such as turning against each other, elopement, and divorce! The number is truly countless!</p>
<p>Sick men who want to cure their symptoms, enhance their love with their wives, and regain the happiness they should enjoy in life, it is not a difficult task in today's era of medical advancement. However, one must never乱服用春药与杂药. For taking aphrodisiacs is like whipping a tired horse, and it will eventually collapse and become irreparable. Taking miscellaneous drugs will only lead to wasted money, little effect, or even delay the opportunity for treatment! According to world-renowned doctors and our experience, taking the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" is the most effective treatment, because this agent is based on the most effective supplementation therapy principle in new medicine, taking the endocrine essence of gonads from robust animals such as monkeys, apes, gorillas, lions, tigers, bears, deer, sea dogs, etc., and refined by scientific cloning, so the quality is precious, the tonic power is great, and it is beyond any similar preparation. After a man takes "Shengzhi Su", he can produce sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate the blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development in one day and night. Continuing to take it continuously will surely cure all symptoms in a short period of time, making energy doubled. Middle-aged and elderly people often take it to prolong life, delay aging, and rejuvenate. Only those with nocturnal emission need to take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission, "Hope Detachable Solid Essence Tablets" (available at major pharmacies such as Zhongxi Wuzhou and the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company, priced at 2 yuan per box).</p>
<p>Patient Zheng Liangjun suffered from severe kidney deficiency and impotence after marriage, and also had nocturnal emission. This caused his appearance to wither and his relationship with his wife to worsen. A month ago, he was introduced by a friend to our clinic for treatment. We immediately instructed him to buy a dozen bottles of "Shengzhi Su" and three boxes of "Hope Detachable Solid Essence Tablets" and take them together. In less than a month, he has recovered completely, his energy is abundant, and the love between him and his wife is better than when they were newly married.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>What Could Be More Shameful! Suffering Annoyance Because of Withered and Shrunken Breasts!</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Since the call for women to have healthy beauty spread to every city, the sickly Xi Shi who only cared about脂粉衣饰装点 have been abandoned by society, and there is no room for them to插足 in social scenes. Not only that, but also because of their various physical defects, such as withered breasts, thin buttocks, withered muscles,憔悴容颜, etc., even in the family, they cannot avoid all kinds of刺戟. Now, let’s give one example of a recent letter of inquiry. Smart girls should have some悟悟了, the original text is as follows: "... to say my environment, there are many servants at home, cars come and go, and the exquisite clothing and enjoyment can be said to be the ultimate in human wealth. In theory, I should know how to be satisfied. What is there to be annoyed about? But in fact, because I have been病病多痛痛since I was a child, I am now suffering from irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, dizziness, abdominal pain, and神倦. There are very few healthy days throughout the year, and what I especially regret is that due to the constant invasion of the病厂, my appearance has become憔悴, my muscles withered, my buttocks thin, and my breasts are especially withered and pitiful. No matter how I dress up, when people see me, I don’t know why, they always竊竊私議. A quick-mouthed relative even called me "老枪寡老" behind my back, and "椒盐排骨" and "乾癟老太婆" seem to have become proper terms in the mouths of the servants. I am really發昏 when I hear this kind of譏訥, but what is the use of發昏? Alas! At the age of花信, I still have no ideal partner, and my youth is wasted, can I not... " In Miss Mou's environment, her encounters are like this, so the tragic fate of others who are not as well off as her can be imagined. However, in this day and age, science is omnipotent, and this kind of defect is also very easy to make up for. The main reason for乳瘍颜衰 is entirely due to the dysfunction of the ovaries, which affects metabolism. At this time, if you take the ovary preparation for women, "Shengzhi Su," which is a good medicine for the right symptom, it will not be difficult to eliminate the above symptoms in a short period of time, so that the body becomes stronger day by day, then the breasts will naturally be high and the cheeks will naturally be rosy. If you continue to take it, you can also prolong life and驻驻青春.</p>
<h3>The Plan for the Year Lies in Spring; The Youth of Nocturnal Emission Should Wake Up Quickly</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>At this time of spring, when all things are sprouting, it is time for us to work hard in time. If you continue to be confused, you will waste a year, or even miss your life! Therefore, we must鍛练着身体 and make it strong, so as to lay the foundation for the happiness of our future. However, young people are most likely to commit self-pollution and纵欲等行为 during this spring, when春情發動, thus,斵伤了性神经, causing精关松弛,爆发着遗精症. If young people suffering from遗精症 do not cure it quickly in this spring, it is even more dangerous! Because after the spring warms up, the精关 will become more and more松弛, and it is very easy to change from light symptoms of night emission to dangerous symptoms of滑精漏精症, or because of the lack of精液 in the body, the脑, 性, 春髓 and other nerves will show a high degree of衰弱, the developmental function will stagnate, and the metabolic function will decrease. Thus, symptoms such as脑衰健忘, 失眠心悸, 腰痠背痛, 早洩阳痿, 发育不全, 未老先衰 will occur. How can this kind of病态靑年 study his academics, develop his career, and create his great future! Moreover, how can he be loved by women and欢悦 by his wives and concubines, thus losing love, losing歡悅, and falling into a tragic situation in life!</p>
<p>If young people can wake up early,遗精症 is not an incurable disease. The method of treatment is to清心寡欲,戒绝自凟, and at the same time take the special medicine for treating遗, "Hope Detachable Solid Essence Tablets" (sold at major pharmacies such as Zhongxi Zhongying, priced at 2 yuan per box) to固精关 and镇静神经. Patients can receive the special effects of sleeping and stopping遗 when they take it that night. If there are already the above symptoms due to遗精, you must also take gonadotropic hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" to培补脑肾, 增益精血, and take it for a month to必可收却病强身之功. If patients can come to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment in person, we can guarantee a cure.</p>

<h3>Academia Sinica Benefits Various University Science and Chemistry Experiments by Manufacturing Instruments and Selling Them to Schools at Reduced Prices; Sino-American and Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Funds Assist in Its Success</h3>
<p>(Kunming Special Dispatch) In order to promote the advancement of scientific research, the National Academia Sinica, recognizing that various schools have relocated to the interior after the war and that it is not easy to purchase foreign exchange, making it difficult to obtain physical and chemical instruments and supplies, has manufactured physical and chemical instruments for middle schools and has received financial assistance from the Sino-American and Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Boards. Therefore, it is able to manufacture a complete set of physical and chemical instruments for middle schools and sell them to schools at half the cost. For several years, many middle schools in the interior have benefited greatly. The Academy is now taking this research and manufacturing of instruments a step further and has started manufacturing physical and chemical instruments for universities, also with the assistance of the Sino-American and Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Funds. It is reported that several sets of physical and chemical instruments for universities will be trial-produced first, and then gradually promoted. Universities will be able to purchase them at low prices, reducing their burden and facilitating student experiments, which will be of great help to the future of science.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of Jinling University After Moving West</h3>
<p>Jinling Women's College of Arts and Sciences Holds 24th Anniversary Celebration</p>
<p>(Chengdu Correspondent) Since Jinling University moved here from Nanjing, everything has been progressing step by step and developing day by day. From the autumn of the 27th year to the summer of the 28th year, a total of 506 students were registered, including 323 in the university department, 89 in the agricultural specialty, and a total of 94 in other auditing students and special students. A total of 514 students were registered in the spring, including 365 in the university department, 66 in the agricultural search, 12 in the electrical specialty, and a total of 10 students in auditing students and remedial students. There were 51 substitute teachers from Huada, Jin Nuda, and Qida. There are a total of 196 faculty and staff members, including 12 who remained in Nanjing to guard the school. The funds are 83% of the highest annual amount in Nanjing. In terms of business, in addition to the normal operation of various professional courses in the two colleges, new businesses include the Anti-Japanese War History of the College of Liberal Arts, slide cataloging, and the Survey of Handicrafts in Sichuan Province. The College of Science added two specialized courses in electrification and automobiles, focusing on the use of copper, soda, sulfuric acid, and insecticides in Sichuan Province to study the nutritional composition of agricultural products in Sichuan Province, and to study lightning chemical reactions. There are also new directions and new efforts in film education, wireless machine parts, and slides. The College of Agriculture has added 51 new research projects and promoted them separately in the three designated promotion areas. The affiliated middle school of the school is located in Wanxian with 512 students. The Chinese and Western professors who remained at the Nanjing school's office have been engaged in refugee relief work since the winter before, and in the autumn, they successively opened Yuling Remedial School and Work-Study School. The refugee treatment and emergency work of Gulou Hospital have not stopped since the school moved in the year before last. The school opened in the autumn of the 18th year and enrolled a total of 206 new students. There were 578 new and old students, and the three colleges of liberal arts, science, and agriculture offered a total of 196 courses. There were 273 faculty and staff members. In terms of funding, it is now possible to restore the highest annual budget in Nanjing. Yuling Women's College of Arts and Sciences celebrated its 24th anniversary in Chengdu in November last year. The school is now revising the organization outline of the college's administration in accordance with the resolution of the first National Education Conference to standardize the national administrative organization methods of colleges and universities above junior college level. The college has always attached importance to home economics courses, and now it is jointly running the home economics department with the Women's College of Huada. The goals are two: (1) to focus on family management and family economics; (2) to focus on food nutrition and hygiene. Among the various departments of the school, the Department of Sociology is the most developed. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Board has subsidized a professorship with a salary of 3,000 yuan to help the department develop. The original school in Nanjing retained some faculty and staff in Nanjing to maintain it. Initially, a women's shelter was set up to accommodate more than 10,000 women and children who had suffered. It ended at the end of May last year. After the end, a vocational training class was set up for women who had difficulty in life, and technicians were hired to teach them skills so that they could be self-reliant. The class has been very effective, and all the products are welcomed by all parties. The society has this need, so the vocational department was continued in the autumn to create a great cause. In addition, because there are not a few young women who cannot have a place to study, an experimental department was added to teach junior high school students to help them. Both departments are quite developed and are still continuing to run.</p>

<h3>Grains: Rice Merchants' Speculative Hearts Die Hard; Although Imported Rice Arrivals Are Strong, Rice Prices Still Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, rice prices have been declining all the way. The price of No. 1 Saigon rice sold for 43.5 yuan, a difference of only 0.5 yuan compared to the closing price of 43 yuan last year.  The huge price increase of 9 yuan within the "red zone" was completely erased, a fortunate occurrence for the people's food supply.  However, at noon, due to steady gold prices and tighter exchange rates, sentiment rebounded.  General floating speculative accounts once again accumulated stocks, causing a reversal.  Yesterday, there were still lingering effects at the opening, although the outflow was normal.  However, traders holding goods believed that pricing based on the origin had become difficult to align.  Regardless of the quantity of goods in transit or the availability of funds, they suppressed their desire to profit from scarcity. Unanimously, they held onto their goods, unwilling to easily release them. Floating speculative clients, deeply understanding the situation, refrained from selling, resulting in very limited turnover in the market.  Therefore, those wishing to buy had to rely on their decisions.  At noon, local stores, seeing the market rebound after a sharp fall, seized the opportunity to purchase, immediately driving up market prices.  Closing prices for all types of imported rice were about 0.5 yuan higher than the previous market.  No. 1 Saigon rice, after hearing of 44.5 yuan in the morning, was directly sold at 45.5 yuan, with fluctuations reaching 1 yuan.  No. 2 rice was sold from 42.3 yuan to 43 yuan.  Fire-grained pointed rice closed at 44 yuan.  March futures original package was 51.5 yuan, spot price was 40.06 to 42.5 yuan per dan.  Tokyo pointed rice was as high as 41.5 yuan, followed by 40.05 yuan, with the lowest grade like brown rice at only 39 yuan.  Mixed broken rice ranged from 34.5 yuan to 33 yuan.  As for domestic glutinous rice, with a lower base price, it attracted attention as soon as the market turned, and prices were easily raised.  Therefore, the price of domestic glutinous rice rose by about 1.5 yuan, but Hong Kong imported glutinous rice only followed imported rice with an increase of about 0.5 yuan.  Early and late season japonica rice and other domestic rice varieties were rumored to have secretly risen by more than one yuan in off-market transactions, and Kunshan Zhen specialty japonica rice, due to scarcity, was particularly popular, selling for as much as 53 yuan, while medium grades were still only 47-48 yuan, special thin indica rice was 48 yuan, and early and late season indica rice was 46 yuan. Only 400-500 bags of early and late season Nan Gang rice arrived from the interior, transferred from Hongkou into the concession.</p>
<p>Imported rice, under the pressure of congested arrivals and large amounts of capital, rebounded once after being absorbed by speculative accounts the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, it fell again due to the competitive blocking by floating accounts, especially with abundant arrivals of both current and forward rice. The situation was softest. In the early market, all rice varieties fell by about 0.5 yuan, but then were taken in by speculative accounts on the opportunity of the small price, and the current and forward rice were raised by nearly a yuan. The digestion of February and March futures was more greedy, and in the afternoon continued to rise. Xiaowen rose from 51 yuan to 51.5 yuan, No. 2 Siam rice rose from 52 yuan to 52.35 yuan, No. 2 Saigon rice rose from 52 yuan to 52.8 yuan, and the turnover of futures hedging transactions also increased to 1,535 tons.</p>
<p>Imported rice is arriving in succession. Danish-owned Jiecheng Shipping Line's Meihe wheel, transported more than 30,000 bags directly from Saigon, arrived in port at around 8 AM the day before yesterday (the 27th), docked at Qichang Pier in Pudong to unload. Also, the Zhizhibisha, a ship specially dispatched by the Java Post Shipping Company to Saigon to load rice, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today, but we now know that it entered port at around 3 PM yesterday, docking at the Blue Funnel Wharf in Pudong. In addition to more than 20,000 bags of imported rice loaded from Saigon, the ship also carried 1,500 tons of pearl rice (i.e., corn), also loaded from Saigon, and unloading began today. (Zu)</p>
<p>After the Wuxi rice market established a public sales office, disorder occurred due to chaotic order, and rice snatching incidents occurred. Most markets were closed. Later, they continued to handle the sale of white rice at a flat price of 25 yuan per shi (unit of volume). The rice market tea party started on the morning of the day before yesterday, and normal trading resumed. The supply of rice boats and the sample packages issued by the warehouses also increased, but buyers were very scarce, resulting in oversupply. The market price of rice immediately plummeted by 1 yuan to 0.5 or 0.6 yuan. The opening price for high-grade brown japonica rice was 26 yuan to 25.7-8 yuan per shi, while the market price for brown japonica rice was 25.35 yuan, a drop of 1.3-5 yuan compared to before the market closure. Japonica rice per dan fell from 14 yuan to as low as 13.2-3 yuan, a drop of nearly 1 yuan compared to the highest price. Many opportunistic factories purchased as much as possible. The opening of the forward market was aided by the news that several hundred bags of white rice were opened in the afternoon of the day before yesterday, together with the settlement reached by the former Rice Federation, immediately shifting sentiment. In addition, apportionment led factories with only Xian Yuan indica rice and miscellaneous grains to replenish japonica rice and brown japonica rice in the market. Retail stores also slightly replenished rice for sale to meet demand. As a result, the rice market turned strong again, trending upward by several jiao (tenths of a yuan) at any time. On the 26th, the market opened with several hundred shi of high-grade white japonica rice priced at 29 yuan, high-grade brown japonica rice at 27.35 yuan, market high-grade brown japonica rice at 27 yuan, japonica rice at 13.735 yuan per dan, and Yuan indica rice at 14 yuan. The Rice Federation has been very busy recently with the apportionment, remittance, and settlement of white rice purchased from Japanese merchants and various flat-price sales. (Zhi)</p>
<h3>Flour Tends to Slacken</h3>
<p>The flour market tended to slacken yesterday. It has been confirmed that Flour Factory No. 1 has been selling at a fixed price of 10 yuan for a long time without any changes. Because rice prices have fallen recently and demand is still comparable, the real sales in this area are temporarily quiet, and customers are even less active. Therefore, sentiment is weak and the market is inevitably affected by the returned goods. It is heard that the initial opening price for the Lao Che Pai warehouse was 14.5-6 yuan, but then fell to 14.4 yuan, 0.2 yuan lower than the previous day. Green Cannon and Warship brands were also lacking in regular market activity due to the quietness of the customer base.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's trading was acceptable. Both Suzhou and Bengbu wheat were traded for a total of ten carts, still bought by Japanese factories. Due to the recent fall in flour prices, a few shops are willing to sell, but the current stock is limited, making it difficult to cross, so the opening price is still around 25 yuan, a slight drop from the previous day.</p>
<p>Goldsmiths' Gold Prices Stay Fixed</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry in gold shops remained fixed throughout the day. Da Tong Heng still posted 485 yuan per tael, and the new shops had the same price. The buying price was reduced by about 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Firm and Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American gold pounds were soft due to limited demand. British gold notes were still stable at first, with a morning price of 55 yuan. In the afternoon, demand rebounded, and the market was strong, with an evening price of 55.3 yuan. The supply and demand for US dollar notes was balanced, and the whole day's process was stable, with an evening price still at 14.53 yuan. Hong Kong dollars and Singapore dollars were very quiet and stable, with no price fluctuations. The market price for travelers' needs for French francs and Annam dollars was slightly firm. The Philippines peso market was weak and slightly loose. The Japanese gold note was slightly higher, with an evening price of 1.295 yuan. The Korean dollar, on the other hand, was loose and cheap, with an evening price of 1.025 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: British and American gold pounds both fell by 0.05 yuan, British gold notes rose by 0.03 yuan, French francs rose by 0.001 yuan, Annam dollars rose by 0.005 yuan, Philippines dollars fell by 0.05 yuan, Philippines dollars fell by 0.03 yuan, and other currencies were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Rises Sharply: Total Increase of 18 Yuan in Three Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for drafts continued to rise. The discount rate per 1,000 yuan once approached 80 yuan, really due to the tightness of funds, leading to speculation. In the morning, 68 yuan rose to 79 yuan, and in the afternoon it slightly returned to 74.5 yuan, in the afternoon it was 75 yuan, 7 yuan higher than the previous day. The increase has been 18 yuan in total for three consecutive days. The rate of interbank lending by the Money Trade Association has not changed, and was 0.12 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Money Shops Raise Lending Rates</h3>
<p>Due to recent market conditions and tighter funds, money shops in this city have reportedly decided to increase the interest rate on loans from 10.5 yuan per 1,000 yuan per month to 12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Buyers Waiting and Watching</h3>
<p>Yesterday's dark market situation for real gold ingots was soft again, returning to the 4,800 yuan mark. Sentiment was unable to recover, partly due to reports of Germany's renewed mediation in the Sino-Japanese War, and partly due to difficult liquidity conditions. As a result, it fell by more than 10 yuan. The ordinary trading at the opening was slow, falling by 15 yuan to 4,790 yuan, due to gold shops and securities firms selling. Later, with some support from Hong Kong firms, it slightly rebounded. However, the foreign exchange suddenly reported weakness, and money changers resisted, coupled with continued selling by securities firms, and a certain bank also sold, immediately falling to a low of 4,772 yuan. Subsequently, a certain bank suddenly bought on behalf of another client, and cash houses frequently purchased, and also the exchange rate soon reported to return to normal, gradually pulling up more than 20 yuan, once reaching 4,798 yuan. Later, as gold shops continued to sell, it closed at 4,790 yuan. The foreign exchange market was closed in the afternoon, and the situation was more stable, closing early. However, the result was a further small drop of 2 yuan due to retail sales, to 4,788 yuan, a decrease of 17 yuan from the previous day. The total transaction was over 1,000 taels. The price of gold jewelry in gold shops was fixed, and customs gold was still stable.</p>
<p>The fall in gold ingots was still small.</p>
<p>From the opening in the morning, due to negative news reports, the gold shops took the lead in shouting to sell, and then the securities firms also competed to sell, and the opening price was down 15 yuan. The gold shops sold 50 taels to a certain bank for 4,790 yuan. After a while, a certain gold shop suddenly bought more than 100 taels on behalf of a Hong Kong firm, and then it rebounded by 5 yuan, buying 20 taels from a peer for 4,795 yuan. Later, because the foreign exchange reported weakness, the securities firms and money changers resumed selling, and at the same time, a certain bank also sold on behalf of customers, and the Hong Kong firms had stopped buying, and fell another 23 yuan. The securities firms sold 30 taels of gold for 4,772 yuan. Later, a certain bank suddenly dragged in retail investors, and a certain cash house frequently purchased, and also the exchange rate soon reported to return to normal, and the rise was seen again. A certain gold shop bought 10 taels from a money changer, as high as 4,798 yuan. At noon, the buying wind gradually subsided, and the gold shops continued to sell, and then fell by a small 8 yuan, with the gold shops doing 30 taels with each other, and a midday closing price of 4,790 yuan. In the afternoon, the gold house first sold 10 taels to the bank for 4,790 yuan. Later, a certain bank sold on behalf of retail investors, and the steps pressed 6 yuan. A certain bank sold 10 taels to a money changer, retreating to 4,784 yuan. After entering, the money changer made a slight buy-in, and recovered 4 yuan, and the money changer did 30 taels with each other, for a late closing price of 4,788 yuan. As a result, it fell by 17 yuan compared with the previous day, and the up and down of the whole day was only 26 yuan. The selling price of the cash house's own brand gold was several yuan higher than that of the gold ingots, and the purchase was reduced by 20 yuan, and the current bid gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and all were seldom done.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Buyers Waiting and Watching</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions, HSBC's listing price, had no up and down. The situation in the dark market for British and American exchange was slightly relaxed at first, and then returned to a normal level. It was reported that Germany intends to try again to mediate in the Sino-Japanese war, which caused speculators to stop buying and turn to wait and see. By half-day, the morning opening was still 4 office 140625 and 6.8125, and the later market was once silent. It was not until about 10 o'clock that the Hong Kong telegram suddenly came to sell, and the buyers had a weak appetite, and the situation was slightly hardened, and grew to 4 office 15625 and 6.84375. Afterwards, it was still for a long time until after 11 o'clock, when Jin Bang suddenly came to pull in the three-month U.S. exchange, and Jia Qian changed industries also had to settle the U.S. dollar bill, the market was flat, and the noon market was scarce, and the state was calm. Until the noon closing, it was still 4 office 14065 and 6.8125, the same as the evening closing yesterday. The futures trend is the same as the spot.</p>
<p>After Jin Bang Settled, It Returned to Level</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London Big Bar was flat and far shrunk by 0.0625. The price of silver in New York was still flat. The London Gold Exchange was stable. The exchanges between the British, the United States, Shanghai, and the frightened, etc. were all flat. The exchanges between the United States, Britain, Shanghai, and France, etc. were also flat and stable. The central listing exchanges are as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling price was 4 office 140625 for British gold and 6.8125 for American exchange. Compared with the previous collection, there was no honor or disgrace. After opening, the state was stable and lacked vitality. When HSBC's listing was announced without moving, the announcement of the white silver balance tax also did not rise or fall. Since then, a Chinese firm suddenly sold on behalf of Hong Kong, so the potential has been slightly hardened. It is estimated that the Hong Kong telegram sold a certain line of spot U.S. exchange 6.84375 to the profitable. At the same time, foreign firms did spot British gold 4 office 156 25 with each other. Afterwards, there was a period of stability, and when Jin Bang suddenly absorbed around 11 o'clock, the market was flat. It is estimated that Jin Bang absorbed 3-month U.S. exchanges 6.75 and 71875 from Huabi and other foreign firms. At that time, Chinese money changers also absorbed the U.S. dollar bill 6.875 from a certain line. For a while, the spot had returned to 4 office 140625 and 6.8125. The noon transaction was light, and the state was calm. Extending to the noon collection, British gold was 4 office 140615, and British exchange was still 6.8125. The next month's British gold was 4 office 09375 and the U.S. exchange was 6.71875. As a result, the current British and American calendars have no honor or disgrace compared to the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong U.S. Exchange Is Slightly Lengthened</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 28th (Wednesday) Telegram, the exchange market opened steadily this morning, and all exchanges have generally not changed. At 10:30, the spot of U.S. exchange was loose 0.0625, which was 24.5625. At 11:30, it was stable, and all exchanges had no glory. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Oriental Bank, Chongqing Bank Established</h3>
<p>French Oriental Bank of Commerce, for the convenience of Chongqing's frightened people to exchange, has established a branch in Chongqing. With the special approval of the Ministry of Finance, it was established on February 10. The manager is the legal person Dumen.</p>
<h3>Securities, Domestic Debt Brewing</h3>
<p>The black market for securities was even more chaotic yesterday. Although there were messages from Germany planning to try again to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, it was no longer valued by the market. The crux of the problem is simply that funds are too tight and capitalists have no power, so it is even more deserted. However, the potential power of brewing to change still exists and should not be ignored, because the big players are supporting each other, and have not been shaken. Yesterday's two markets, the price was extremely stable, the up and down to the micro, but the table repeatedly in and out, only Yuan Kang and No. 16 slightly bought in, Zhongyi Runli and Jiu Feng and other slightly sold out, and the rest are sporadic embellishments. As a result, it slightly recovered by 0.05 yuan to 0.1 to 0.2 yuan, and the number of transactions was about 400,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, the number of transactions reached 20 shares of Dafeng Yarn Factory, the price was 100 yuan. It was also heard that 20 shares of the Bank of China were traded, and the price was 65 yuan.</p>
<p>The potential of the stock market of the Public Works Bureau is slightly weaker, and the buyer's orders are easy to complete, but there is no real pressure from the sellers. The shares of Hui Defeng are still strong, standing firm at 109.5 yuan. The shares of Yihua Yarn Factory have good demand at a price of 42 yuan. Rubber stocks are still dim, except for the Griez Rubber Trust and the land list, there is little interest in other stocks.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Tuesday) Telegram, the listed prices of China's foreign debt today are still stable, and there is no change in the various bonds up and down.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Tuesday) Telegram, the listed prices of British-owned Far East companies' stocks today rose more and fell less. Shanghai Tap Water A shares fell 1 pound to 13.5 pounds. Baoan Insurance shares rose 1.5 pounds to 28 pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine bearer shares rose 6 pence to 18 shillings, and the rest were flat.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers, March Futures Yarn, Approaching the 900 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The yarn continues to rise, and the situation is still stable. This is because raw cotton and various opening fees are expensive, which has led to an increase in the cost of the factory, so the yarn factory has no intention of selling yarn, so the sentiment is excited, and the March futures yarn is bought in one after another. At the same time, the sales of yarn from various gangs in South China have gradually improved, and the market has become more prominent. The highest price in March was 895 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning market for the current yarn is slightly flat, because there is no major change in foreign cotton and gold prices. The opening price of 20-count double horse yarn is 865 yuan, and the March futures price is 885 yuan. As soon as this price opened, the buyers slightly increased, the table wind tightened, and slowly reached 8734 yuan, and the March futures price was 895 yuan. Although there were those who made a profit in the middle, the momentum was still strong. It is estimated that the half-day turnover was 2,145 bags, and the price of 20-count double horse yarn rose by 6 yuan to 10 yuan. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left, peers 1, 900 Hong Kong 245 Statistics 1, 145.</p>
<h3>Although the Factory Office Is Silent, the Price of Cotton Is Still Fixed</h3>
<p>The trading of this cotton is still considered not thin, but the factory is still less purchasing, but the peer-to-peer transactions are particularly lively, the sentiment is firm, and the market price is stable. However, foreign cotton is also in a swirl, but the exchange market is not loose, so it is still difficult to count. 1,218 bags of Tonghua arrived in Subei in the afternoon. The situation of the current cotton is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another message The price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market first rose yesterday due to good Liverpool calls, and then returned to a small level due to mass sales and the sale of a part of the reverse limit price. As a result, the closing price was slightly lower than the previous day 3-5 pounds. The Indian cotton market has been very prosperous recently. Yesterday, together with the forecast, it rose by another 4 rupees. Egypt fell more than 10 pounds.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very stable recently. Various industries are very enthusiastic, but due to the tight capital, the amount of transactions has been greatly reduced, and the factory's purchase intention is very weak. A large number of previously ordered goods have also arrived, and 40,000 bags of American cotton will arrive this week. The factory price converted to US exchange 6.8125 in yesterday's cotton market is as follows.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods, March Futures Have Opened, Local Customer Sales Are Active, Selling Prices Are Mostly Higher</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth The February futures market for cotton cloth was full yesterday, and the price in March was 0.5 yuan to 1 yuan higher per piece than in the month, so the local street is quite interested in the current pad. The selling price of white goods has risen by about 0.05 yuan per piece. Dyed and printed yarn money cloth has risen by 0.5 yuan to 0.75 yuan per piece. The local street has traded more than 500 bags of white goods, coarse and fine twill gray cloth, and more than 300 pieces of dyed and printed cloth. The Wenzhou gang has handled nearly 200 pieces of fine cloth, coarse cloth, silk cloth, patterned cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill. The Minbang has handled more than 100 pieces of silk cloth, striped bleached cloth, and colored cloth. The Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs have handled a number of pieces of fine cloth, silk cloth, patterned cloth, and twill. The Nanyang gang in Siam, Singapore and other places has handled more than 5,000 pieces of standard cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth.</p>
<p>Cloth The prices of white goods and colored goods continued to rise uniformly. The morning market for Longtou fine cloth was flat, but the market rose again, and the current price was 26.95 yuan per piece. Other middle and lower grades also jumped up by about 0.25 yuan per piece. Sijunzi poplin is especially smart, and the current price is already selling for 0.815 yuan per yard, and 0.84 yuan next month.</p>
<h3>Oil Market, Soybean Oil Returned to 1 Yuan in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Recently, the oil market has been restricted by various environmental factors, and the lack of real sales has led to a lack of sentiment. The market has been trimmed, and soybean oil has fallen by 3 yuan again, and peanut oil has continued to fall by 0.2 yuan. Suddenly, in the afternoon, the mainland office came to ask, and the price rose by about 1 yuan again. As a result, a total of 60 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded, the price was 111 yuan to 112 yuan, 20 barrels of Jiangbei oil, the price was 108.5 yuan, 10 barrels of Hankou oil, the price was 110.05 yuan, and 80 barrels of green and peanut oil, the price was 114 yuan to 113 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Foreign Sugar Returned</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, because it has risen too much for days, and the foreign exchange is lengthened, the price has turned loose. The association has drawn a board of 24 coarse white foreign warehouse new arrivals 62.2 yuan, small 0.8 yuan, old goods 61.7 yuan, small yuan, Taigu Chebai small 1.4 yuan to yuan Xu, West warehouse B Mark 65.1 yuan, East warehouse 64.9 yuan, small 0.6 yuan, HX Mark 62 yuan, small 1 yuan, H Mark Chechi is still 45 yuan to 44.5 yuan, Dutch red small 0.5 yuan, WA Mark 46.5 yuan, WP Mark 47 yuan, the domestic sugar market is still stable. Jianbang opened 260 bags of Diaoqing, 46.5 yuan, and another 115 baskets, 45.8 yuan. Xinghua opened more than 100 bags of Gongfen, 58 yuan to 58.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal, White Coal Clearly Fixed and Secretly Cheap</h3>
<p>The selling party in the white coal market has a firm mind, but once the spring order is handed over, the sales market is inevitably sluggish, and the hands of the stilt-up are gradually released, which is a fierce kill for the local street, so the door price is also loose. Kaihongji lift block is 190 yuan per ton, sieve block is 180 yuan, and Tong is 175 yuan. Haifeng white coal is still prosperous due to the need for shop liquidation, so it still supports the original market.</p>

<h3>Terminally Ill</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>The obvious signs of social illness, the complexity of the condition, and the severity of the situation no longer allow us to avoid seeking medical attention.</p>
<p>The corpses lying east and west, the starving people in the streets and alleys, and the endless cases of rice snatching all prove that treating social diseases is urgent.</p>
<p>In today's era of soaring prices, the phenomenon of social contradictions has reached its peak. On the one hand, we see starving people and bandits, and on the other hand, we see speculators hoarding rice, flour, and coal, leaving them unused.</p>
<p>The greatest purpose of producing rice, flour, and coal is to increase the happiness of the masses and to be utilized by everyone. But that's not the case now. The current social system has embarked on a dead end like a bull's horn, making these daily necessities tools for merchants to profit, commodities for speculative manipulation; making most of the food and fuel hoarded waste, while at the same time making most of the people live on the line between hunger and cold.</p>
<p>Is a social system that traps the majority of innocent people in a life of poverty reasonable? Is it reasonable to allow a few people to lead excessively luxurious lives, while at the same time holding the power to control the fate of the majority, hoarding essential items and letting the majority of the unfortunate struggle under a tragic destiny? Can such a society be said to have no problems?</p>
<p>Let me tell you, our society is terminally ill!</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>Only Child</h3>
<p>— Wen He</p>
<p>Parents' love for their children is innate; however, only children are often especially spoiled. This phenomenon is particularly prominent in China because the Chinese traditionally believe in carrying on the family line. Since the responsibility of an only child is exceptionally significant, parents tend to cherish them even more. These only children receive abnormally indulgent education during their youth, and their personality development is bound to differ from that of ordinary children. After they reach adulthood, they no longer have parents to pamper them, and their lives may also differ from others. The Chinese have generally overlooked these issues. Here, we introduce a report researched by an American psychologist, Mr. Burleigh.</p>
<p>Mr. Burleigh studied four hundred only children or spoiled children who had already reached adulthood. The youngest was eighteen years old, and the oldest was sixty-eight years old. Among them, 172 were male and 228 were female. He discovered a common phenomenon among these individuals: they all found it difficult to compete with others in the struggle for survival. They were all cared for and nurtured by their mothers, so they all lacked independence and self-confidence.</p>
<p>Only children mingle with adults from a young age, often maturing early. As they grow older, they are not accustomed to socializing with people of similar age. They can be said to have few friends and cannot adapt to their society.</p>
<p>When only children have any requests, their parents always grant them. When they make mistakes, their parents do not discipline them. As a result, after they grow up, even a slight disregard from others can make them feel sad for days or even weeks. One only daughter, who attended a gathering with a close friend, attempted suicide out of anger because her friend received more attention than she did at the event.</p>
<p>Only children do not experience competition from siblings, and it seems as if they are in charge of everything in the family. They are accustomed to hearing praise from others from a young age, leading them to feel that they are the most important person in the world. Not only are they conceited, but they are also extremely jealous. They are envious of the happiness of their relatives and friends, so people find them annoying. No wonder they are depressed.</p>
<p>Because only children are spoiled by their parents, their emotional energy is difficult to transfer to the opposite sex, resulting in abnormal love lives. In Mr. Burleigh's statistics of four hundred people, 36 percent had unusual love lives. Some were homosexuals, voyeurs, exhibitionists, sadists, masochists, etc. Eighteen percent suffered from various types of "early decline syndrome," meaning they were not far from being insane.</p>
<p>An example of a historically spoiled and overindulged only child is the Roman tyrant Nero. However, only children who are not spoiled can develop like ordinary children and are likely to excel. For example, China's great sage Confucius was an only child and can serve as a representative of well-educated only children.</p>
<h3>Every Profession Produces an Expert</h3>
<p>— Written by Hu Zhenxiang</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Mr. Wells's Verbal Battle with Lord Haw-Haw</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Recently, two Mr. Wellses have gained international prominence. One is the US Secretary of State, who was sent to Europe to investigate the four countries of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy and make recommendations, serving as a peace envoy. However, the other, a British historical writer famous for his book "The Shape of Things to Come," is a god of war.</p>
<p>The writer Wells recently engaged in a verbal battle with the German speaker Lord Haw-Haw, which attracted much attention. The facts are as follows: Wells recently published an article in the authoritative American magazine "Free World," echoing George Bernard Shaw's proposal that the stalemate on the front lines is depressing, and that the British Air Force should bomb Berlin on a large scale. He wrote, "I am a pacifist, but a true one. Germany's actions not only disrupt the world but also hinder the wheel of evolution, so we must bomb them. Bombing is a method that Germany used to inflict suffering on other nations, and now we want them to taste the fruits of their actions."</p>
<p>Wells's remarks immediately garnered attention and aroused the indignation of the German commentator Lord Haw-Haw. Lord Haw-Haw is the only eloquent speaker on German radio, fluent in English. Every evening, he uses radio waves to lecture the British public, discussing the merits and demerits of British politics. Upon hearing Wells's remarks, he threatened the British public, saying, "If a bomb falls on Berlin, we will retaliate with ten bombs on London. I advise the British not to be reckless, because the cruelty of our retaliatory measures is beyond the imagination of a historian like Wells."</p>
<p>Someone asked Wells for his thoughts on Lord Haw-Haw's provocation. He did not care, saying that it was a sign of Germany's weakness and a frightened cry. If the Germans had courage, they would have dared to bomb England when they bombed Warsaw last September. "In short, I think it is better to bomb them to death than to starve them to death by naval blockade. This method is direct and allows them to clear their minds sooner."</p>
<p>Wells's passionate remarks were indeed welcomed and excited by the general public; however, as of now, those in political circles who are cautious have not yet agreed to send planes to bomb Berlin. In fact, it is just a verbal battle between Wells and the German propagandist.</p>

<h3>The Foresight of Inventors</h3>
<p>— Mo Ming</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the great contributions of many scientists and inventors have promoted human civilization and led to a more fulfilling and meaningful life. However, on the other hand, they have also "helped the wicked" and fostered the development of humanity's worst traits, making the world more tragic and restless. Is it a merit or a crime? Is it a blessing or a curse? It is not easy to distinguish clearly. However, inventors are not without foresight, and they have long considered this point! The inventor of the airship, Francesco Lana, in 1670, had already anticipated that his invention would bring disaster to future generations. Although his invention was successful, he considered it most regrettable that he had created a tool for unscrupulous people to commit inhumane and irrational atrocities.</p>
<p>Leonardo da Vinci, the great Italian artist and scientist of the fifteenth century, should be considered the earliest inventor of the submarine. From his notes, we can discover why he did not make his submarine invention public: "Because humans have a deeply ingrained love of killing, they will inevitably use this method to secretly attack ships underwater, killing and plundering without restraint."</p>
<p>It is heartbreaking that these ancient predictions have all come true in the twentieth century. Airplanes and submarines have demonstrated the power to massacre the innocent in several wars, and now it is even worse. If these inventors knew in the afterlife, they would probably feel guilty and uneasy.</p>
<p>Reflections</p>
<h3>Not "Fate"!</h3>
<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>"In the past," Chinese people often liked to attribute disasters they encountered to "fate," such as losing their job being attributed to "fate," their wife running away with someone else being attributed to "fate," and even a sore on their back or a mosquito bite on their thigh being attributed to "fate." Some even believed that fate was irresistible and unavoidable, so they did not bother to investigate the causes of disasters.</p>
<p>Believing in fate is "not trusting oneself," and the result is burying oneself alive in fate.</p>
<p>The above refers to "the past," and things should be different now. However, some people still do not understand. For example, when the price of rice rises from eight yuan per dan (unit of weight) to fifty yuan, some people sigh about their "bitter fate" without deeply considering whether it is really "fate" or whether there are "more obvious" reasons. Even if it rises to one hundred yuan per dan, some people still believe it is "predestined"!</p>
<p>The greed of hoarders is endless. It is hoped that everyone will think of a proper way to sanction them. At the same time, it is necessary to recognize that the reason for high prices is not due to "fate"!</p>
<h3>Axe Handle</h3>
<p>— Hong Fei</p>
<p>——A Modern Fairy Tale——</p>
<p>A long, long time ago, when no one dreamed of Hitler, a woodcutter went into the forest and begged the trees to let his axe have a handle.</p>
<p>The trees saw that this was such a small request, so they generously agreed and decided that the simple and unadorned poplar tree would provide the woodcutter with an axe handle. The woodcutter fitted the axe handle and immediately began to chop and cut down all the large trees in the forest.</p>
<p>The oak tree saw that things were terrible and knew it was too late for regret. It whispered to the cedar tree, "I never imagined that the first concession would lead to our mutual destruction. If we had not been generous with others and sacrificed our lowly neighbors, then we might have been able to survive forever."</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Kunming's Cinemas Use Local Dialect to Translate Western Films' Main Points; New-Style Cinema Has Been Completed</h3>
<p>— Tai Long</p>
<p>Kunming is now the most prosperous area in the southwest, and various entertainment venues are flourishing. The film industry is also gradually developing, and the cinemas have excellent box office sales. It is also rumored that "China Film Studio," originally in Chongqing, may move to Yunnan.</p>
<p>Kunming originally had only two cinemas, Yile and Dazhong. The films shown were mostly Western films, with very few domestic films. However, the Western films were quite old, like those shown in the Sanlun Cinemas in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Recently, a new-style cinema, the "Nanping" Grand Theatre, has been completed. Its architecture, both exterior and interior, is extremely luxurious and the facilities are perfect, comparable to the top-tier cinemas in Shanghai. During the holidays, each cinema is full. Therefore, some people pre-purchase tickets and then raise the price before the screening to sell them to others. There are children at the ticket office who specialize in buying tickets for customers, taking a small fee. At the start of the screening, the Chinese national anthem is played on the loudspeaker, and the audience stands up to pay respects when photos of Sun Yat-sen, Chairman Lin Sen, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and Provincial Chairman Long Yun are displayed on the screen. There are dozens of advertising slides, which are said to be due to the low cost. The slides are changed very quickly, and then the feature film begins. In order to make the plot clear to the audience who do not understand English, the cinema has a translator on the balcony who loudly translates the main points of the dialogue in the film into the Yunnan dialect. However, there are not many local viewers in the province now, so whether the foreign viewers who do not understand English but also do not understand the Yunnan dialect can thoroughly understand the dialogue in the film is still questionable.</p>
<h3>New Lineup of Shanghai Storytelling Venues</h3>
<p>— Yu Xiu</p>
<p>The Lunar New Year is the season for each storytelling venue to adjust its lineup, so for the "New Year lineup," each venue has a new lineup. However, in Shanghai storytelling venues, under the situation of being monopolized by "Da Xiang Dang," although it is said to be adjusting the lineup, it is ultimately the same old tune, with the same faces that have been seen to death. Moreover, the number of storytelling venues is limited, and there is a surplus of talent, so even "Da Xiang Dang" inevitably has the risk of being left out. Now, Jiang Zhu and Xia Hesheng cannot get a spot, which is one example.</p>
<p>During the daytime, the strength of Dongfang is the most powerful. Zhu Zhao, Shen Xue, and Yang's lineup are all authorities in storytelling. Even Wu Jun'an and Xu Jixiang each have the power to attract an audience. Tang Feng's "Guobao Lu," although relatively inferior, is well-suited and popular in Dongfang, so it has been renewed. The next one is Lake. In the daytime small storytelling, in addition to Zhu Zhao, there are Yan Xueting and Zhou Jiang's lineup. Zhang Hongsheng's "Yinglie" is also very popular. The nighttime is the world of Qing Yueshe, but only Huang Yi'an's lineup is barely satisfactory.</p>
<p>Ya Lu's daytime lineup is inferior. Although Chen Ruilin is performing the new story "Nine Silk Threads," it rarely attracts an audience. Even Cao Ren'an's "Wu Yue Chunqiu" and Tang Kangbo's "Shuibo Liangshan" are making people sick of listening. In addition to Zhou Jiang, Zhu Zhao, and Zhang Hongsheng, the nighttime lineup includes Gu Hongbo's "Civet Cat Exchanging Prince," which is also popular everywhere. In fact, Gu's strength lies only in his quickness. In terms of storytelling skills, support, and roles, he is still far behind his teacher Yang Lianqing. Li Zhongkang of Nanyuan Daytime, the younger brother of storytelling king Li Bokang, has the style of his brother in his storytelling. Unfortunately, his energy is insufficient, and his throat is sandy, but the charm is still very elegant and moving.</p>
<p>Huiquanlou is the oldest storytelling venue, but this year it lacks special brilliance. However, the fact that it has chosen to use two new talents is a good thing. One lineup is Pang Xueting and Xie Hanting in the daytime, performing "Luo Jin Shan." They are disciples of Jiang Ruting, so their storytelling is similar to their teacher. The pipa is particularly well played. The other lineup is Yan Xiaoxiang's "Western Han" in the nighttime. I have not had the opportunity to hear his art, so I dare not comment rashly. The early morning storytelling is still Cao Ren'an's "Lie You." In addition, Longquan and Fuchun are evenly matched, with each having its own strengths and weaknesses. As for the female storytelling of Puyushe, due to limited manpower, there is no way to develop, so it is still confined to a corner of the Nanjing storytelling venue. Since Xie Xiaotian's marriage, the power to attract an audience for the three-day lineup has also been greatly reduced. Therefore, unless Puyushe can have strong reinforcements, it will be difficult to reverse this decline in a short time.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Six-Year-Old Prodigy Shu Duoyun's Escort</h3>
<p>— Cao Cao</p>
<p>The two amateur opera troupes, Haishang and Gubo, performed enthusiastically during the Lunar New Year, with each amateur showing their best works to entertain the audience. More than twenty operas were performed in total. I wanted to comment on them one by one, but due to limited space, it was impossible. However, the most eye-catching was Miss Shu Duoyun, the daughter of Mr. Shu Sheyu (now a second-grade student at Jian Shu Elementary School). At only six years old, her performance of "Su San Escorted" was surprisingly experienced. Her gestures and expressions were in harmony with the锣鼓 (percussion instruments) , and she was calm, unhurried, and not pretentious. Her singing was stable, and her rhythm was accurate. That day, famous young actor Yu Zhenfei also stood on the stage, applauding non-stop throughout the performance. He especially praised her expression of pursing her lips when she threw down her cane at the line "There are no good people in Hongdong County." This opera was personally taught by Mrs. Osen, and it is true that a famous teacher produces a brilliant student. The costumes are also excellent.</p>
<h3>"China Film News"</h3>
<p>— Traveling Reporter</p>
<p>Launching on March 15th</p>
<p>There will be a huge publication appearing in this year's publishing world, which is the weekly "China Film News" dedicated to Chinese film news. Due to the success of "Asian Film News," the Chinese film industry has encountered some difficulties, that is, the success of Western film promotion and audiences. For this reason, and not only to promote film culture, several people enthusiastic about domestic films decided to found a weekly "China Film News," which is scheduled to be published on March 15th.</p>
<p>As far as I know, they have sufficient capital, and they are maintained by advertising under the organization of a limited company. They are printed on glossy paper, eight open pages, the same as "Asian Film News," with equal emphasis on pictures and text, with specially invited experts writing articles, and various film companies and theaters also helping to sponsor.</p>
<p>For the large-scale plan, the selling price is temporarily set at five cents per copy, and the annual subscription price is two yuan including postage, and each issue has movie tickets and movie star photos as prizes to encourage the interest of subscribers. This is of course also news that movie fans are happy to know, right?</p>

<h3>Listening to Huangjin Erjinkong (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Xi Xiaobo ascended to the stage of Huangjin on the first day of the Lunar New Year of Gengchen, jumping from second-tier old male role to first-tier. This is a happy event. I should have rushed to listen to the wonderful performance some days ago, but for half a month, it was difficult to buy tickets, and I missed listening to "Empty City Stratagem" and "Bumping Monument." Until the 21st, "Erjinkong" was performed, and I was invited by a singing friend, Mr. Zhang, who had reserved seats. I first watched "Su Huantao Bai Shan Dao Jun." Gao Shenglin played Tianba, imitating Yang Xiaolou in singing, acting, and recitation, with a concise and clear representation. There were several bursts of laughter. Further study is needed. He is young now, and in the future, he can be expected to achieve great things. Qiu Shengrong played Dou Erdun. I did not see the horse theft scene before. There was too much nasal sound in the "Bai Shan" singing. The acting and dialogue were sometimes overdone and sometimes too restrained, probably to save energy to sing "Erjinkong." I think Qiu should learn from his father, Qiu Guixian, and not from Jin Shaoshan. Li Kechang's replacement in the "Hook Theft" scene was quite competent. His singing imitating Huang San was also quite tasteful.</p>
<p>"Erjinkong" began, and Hou Yulan, playing Li Yanfei, came on stage, singing a segment of the "Ehuang Zhengban," which was old-fashioned and fairly stable. Xi Xiaobo sang a segment of "Qian Sui Ye," which was perfect and flawless, but lacked excitement. His voice can handle the proper main key, with some reserve at the high notes, but slightly lacking in the wide range. In each theater, during the half-month before the Lantern Festival, with double daytime and nighttime performances, the voices of the actors were inevitably affected. Even the best voices would be 10% off, and their spirits were like those of soldiers who had fought for a long time, with their courage exhausted. Therefore, veteran opera fans who are particular about the details of the performance rarely enter the theater before the Lantern Festival. That Xi and the other three still have this achievement can be considered a remarkable talent.</p>
