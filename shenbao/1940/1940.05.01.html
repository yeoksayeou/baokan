<h3 id="c10">今日中國之勞動節 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>今日爲超越疆域族類之勞動節。</p>
<p>吾人竊深欣幸於獲此至善之機緣，得掬悃忱，謹向中國全國勞動界，致其無上敬愛之誠。此非一時一節之感念，復非一報一人之私言；蓋今日之中國勞動界實在最可同情之境界之中。他日殊於今日，他國殊於中國，他界殊於勞動界；此其爲此日此國此界之特徵者，應爲任何人發於良知而共認之，亦必爲任何人發於良知而同情之。爰攄肺腑，瀝肝膽，陳之中國勞動界之前，並願史普遍喚起任何人對於中國勞動界之良知。</p>
<p>中國之抗戰，神聖戰爭也；中國之建國，神聖使命，神聖事業也。何以見其神聖？曰：抗建動機，發於公道和平博愛；抗建過程，合於公道和平博愛；抗建之成就與貢獻，必有造於公道和平博愛；斯神聖視之而不疑，斯神聖居之向不媿。原勞動界之於現代文明，盡大力，有大功，旣爲大衆所熟知，故有勞動神聖之目；誠以血汗博工資，以工資維生活，逈異不勞而獲，抑目所勞甚而所獲菲，是以勞動界生存於現代，可以俯仰天地而傲視羣倫。然察其客觀結果，或身受脅迫而適成爲脅迫者之工具，或身受荼毒而適助長荼毒者之罪惡。例如彼侵略國家之勞動界不任略侵之咎，顧非彼勞動界血汗，則主持侵略者將何所資以侵略？仙如其他國家之勞動界，非不深惡痛絕於侵略國家之罪行，顧與侵略國家在一般經濟上之供求往返，甚至在軍火及其原料上之買賣不絕，固無不以勞動界血汗爲之主要因素馬。然則各國之所謂勞動神聖，有時而實爲罪惡之隊伍。以此比較論之於中國神聖抗建之全同，將領士兵爲前綫之戰鬥員，勞動界則爲中堅之戰鬥員，勞動界不惟於其操作之主觀意識，時時刻刻，事事物物，必以抗建爲宗；考其操作之終始，亦每一階段盡合神聖意義者也。</p>
<p>顧中國勞動界之現實何似乎？由形形色色之威脅利誘，形洛勢禁。乃致輿神聖之抗建事功相隔離者，甚至含垢忍辱，耗其血汗，所操作直接或間接與抗建事功相牴牾者，非無其人，於淪陷區爲甚。夫以良知論功罪，則大義昭然。豈有假借餘地；若作原情之論，非不可憫也。至於絕大多數之中國勞動界，究其實際，則盡大力，有大功矣；論其方式，猶是勞力與酬報也；顧乃幾乎無以維持其最低度之正常生活，百物騰貴，自爲衆所共知，而勞動界旣與百物無緣；蓋積一月之工資，不足擔石之代價，一家數口，僅求無饑而不可得，則其他百物豈勞動界所得問津。世人莫謂凍餒死者。僅彼乞食兒，在勞動界究不至此。要知典質以彌不足，其性貿實爲毀其旣往之資產：借貸以彌不足，其性質實爲耗其方來之收益：從事於額外工作以彌不足，其性質實爲預支其體力與壽命；驅老弱婦孺覓錙銖以彌不足，其性質實爲羅掘繼往開來之家族而犧牲之；此數者，固中國勞動界普遍而實在之現象也。夫生而爲中國人，適逢此大時代，茹苦如飴，視死如歸，各如其本位，各盡其天職，當然絕無怨尤。然百物騰貴，不盡爲大時代之當然現象，輒有其不合理不合法之貪酷爲之原因焉：於此百物騰貴之中，利用勞動者之血汗而致富者不知其若干輩焉。若此其不平，未可以其爲局部現象而諱之。此在平時，此在他國，至少亦不免於局部工潮，甚或不免引起何種勞動運動；蓋改善勞動條件爲勞動界權利範圍內之要求，而物價騰貴尤爲一般要求改善勞動條件之正當理由。今日之中國勞動界雖在生活艱難之中，却在抗建大義之下，於是困苦萬狀，委屈萬狀，亦隱忍萬狀。凡此困苦委屈，不待深入勞動界而知之，但問工資每日若干？糧食每斤若干？自必予勞動界以無上同情矣。以勞動界之隱忍，以一般社會之同情，由大時代中之相安，念抗戰勝利後之復興，是不能不厚望於資本家與企業家，體認勞動界實爲抗建之中堅戰鬭員，務秉良知，務揮良能，時時刻刻，事事物物，顧及勞動界應有之福。要知所謂勞資之於中國，自今日之戰時以迄將來之戰後，絕非對立之二階層，乃爲務相和諧之永久伴侶；此由戰時之共患難而奠定相敬相愛之基礎，亦由戰事所得敎訓而知中國百業落後，必由勞資相敬相愛始得相勗以急起直追。</p>

<p>日本朝野，對於美國國會討論議員文生所提出的第三次海軍擴大案，異常關心。其故有二：一因數月來美國對日態度日趨强硬，二因美國海軍的活動範圍或將伸展到日本附近的海面。第一種因不在本文範圍之內，不過一九一一年美日商約的廢止是不容忽視的，美國不願續訂新商約尤使日本人獲得深刻印象，認爲美國確實抱着反對日本對華政策的意嚮。有些人因而疑問美日衝突可吾避免。日本在亞洲大陸擴展政策，美國顯然拒絕合作，並擬壓迫日本改變這種政策。無論如何現局實在充滿着危險。</p>
<p>作者並沒有指摘美國海軍擴大計劃的理由。三年前，英國決定擴充海軍五年計劃時，作者會著文說明英國這種計劃將刺激美國擴張海軍。美國海軍擴張的影響將越太平洋而波及日本。美國海軍政策的方針在維持世界最大海軍力的均勢。所以英國的五年計劃，自然會促使美國加造軍艦，更轉而迫使日本擴充海軍，以應付龐大的美國艦隊。</p>
<p>文生氏第一次海軍造艦案係在一九三四年春由美國國會通過規定造戰鬥艦六艘，各級輔助艦九十六艘，共計二百零二艘，四十三萬噸。其主旨係爲美國建造實力牛均的艦隊，不能認爲大海軍政策的微象，因爲直到該議案通過時止，美國海軍雖有最强大的戰鬥艦和甲級巡洋艦，但乙級巡洋艦，驅逐艦和潛水艇，實力較低，對於戰艦不足以維持戰略上的比例。此外，文生第「案所規定建造的是各海軍國所認爲必要的艦隊。</p>
<p>當時美國有較一九一一年設計的奧克萊賀瑪號更老的戰艦十五艘。所有的轉巡洋艦十艘確是太少。至於美國所有的驅逐艦二百二十三艘，大多是一九一八年至一九一九年間緊急時期所落成，已經不合時宜。可充派第一綫軍艦的祇有五十艘。美國潛艇九十一艘中新式的約二十艘。所以文生第一案旨在迭新艦，以代這些陳舊的戰艦，並造新式輔助艦，以應付戰略上的需要，事屬當然。况且這案通過的時候，一九三〇年的倫敦海軍條件還是有效的，美國建造條的限度以內的輔助艦九十六艘，可說只是履行其條約上的權利，所以不能說它是海軍競爭的挑釁行動。但是美國根據條件建造活動力很大的最新式軍艦，編成艦隊，以夏威夷羣島的珍珠港爲根據地，却也很易擴張攻勢到日本本部附近的海面。</p>
<p>美國依照文生第一案造成的軍艦，異常圓滿。一九二九年所造的重巡洋艦鹽城湖號和其後造成的潘薩柯拉號却全然不同，這兩艦顯求達到預期的完善程度。可是根據文生的計劉，在一九三八年造成的第一艘軍艦，即裝有六英寸口徑大砲的巡洋艦布洛克林號，實足驚人。在這萬噸巡洋艦上裝六英寸大砲十五尊，並不逾份。每小時三十三海里的速率也不稀罕。可是布洛克林號的裝甲板却較舉世任何國重巡艦厚出兩倍以上，因此便補救了此種軍艦最大的弱點。布洛克林號的續航力在一萬二千英里以上，創一切水面艦隻續航力的新紀錄。</p>
<p>一般人都信美國艦隊中最弱的是驅逐艦隊。但按照文生的計劃，這一點也已得到顯著的改善。例如根據文生計劃造成的第一艦驅逐艦克萊文號，排水量一千五百噸，但其戰鬥力足與舉世任何第一級驅逐艦相等。該艦裝有五英寸大砲四尊，二十一英寸魚雷放射管十六具。至於每小時三十七海里的速率並非超乎尋常，但該艦具有較英日任何驅逐艦爲大的續航力，觀於該艦載着重油四百噸，不賴供應船接濟，能續航六千英里一節，可爲明證。與克萊文級同時建造的桑麼。士級驅逐艦，排水量一千八百噸，裝五英寸大砲八尊，續航力約七千英里。此外普奇級潛艇一艘，排水量雖祇一千二百五十噸，但能作一萬五千里之長征。</p>
<p>上文，討論的三種軍艦，即巡洋艦，驅逐艦，和潛艇，所具備的共同特點，即爲特別精銳的武備和偉大的續航力。這些軍艦，因爲具有異當的續航力，不免發生一種弱點。一艘軍艦增加續航力勢必减輕武裝，這可不言自明。因爲續航力的增加，不但需要更大的容量和重量，以裝載燃料和食物，且需有供給官兵容身的將殊設備。原定配備武裝的噸位必定减少。其確切數量雖未能言定，然而克萊文級驅逐　的續航力假定從六千英里减到三千英里必能添裝五英寸大砲一尊。</p>
<p>日本軍艦與美艦不同之處就在减小續航力加强武裝。假如美海軍的編制和配備，不以渡洋作戰爲目的，美國對日海軍儘保持一種優勢。爲將來的美日關係和世界一般和平計，美日兩國海軍均須嚴格保持守勢。（譯Contemporay　Japan）</p>

<p>男子漢！大丈夫！這種稱呼，在字義上即已有光榮的流露，何况身當其衝的就是我們自己！那末，一個男子由成年而結婚，在夫婦間的愛情上，就應當用着他充沛的精力，努力地加以灌漑與栽培，使他們的愛情之花，開放得異常的燦爛而美麗，同時因愛情的鼓勵，奮發地向着光明的前途邁進，這種人生是多麼地幸福而有意義！西諺有云：「一個美滿的生活，必須要有愛情來鼓勵，智識來領導」。眞是至理名言！</p>
<p>誠然，一個婚後的男子，無論在愛情上事業上均負有重大的責任。能負責任即是光榮，這是新婚丈夫應牢記在心中的格言。可是我知道有着很多的結婚男子在諉卸着做丈夫的責任，或竟把責任推在妻子的身上。丈夫患着精薄不育症，婚後數年不育，說是妻子的不娠，而要討小老婆，可是討了小老婆仍然不育，但他的小老婆早已和別人生過孩子了。也有一種丈夫，因早年曾犯自凟縱慾，虧損了生殖腺內分泌液，致精關鬆弛，腦，性，脊髓等神經衰弱，於是凡早洩，陽痿，發育不全，精薄不育，腦衰健忘，未老先衰等症象叢生，婚後在夫婦生活上每不能滿足其妻子的要求，或竟完全愧對其妻者亦有之，致令其妻芳心寂寞，春闔情怨，這豈是家庭中的好現象？聰明的丈夫，能速謀自强之道，來負起他應有的責任，尙為未晚，所最愚蠢而可恥者，仍因循不悟，不特自己的身體將至於不可救藥，其妻亦勢必惱羞成怒，或發雷霆之威；或因情慾的飢渴，與人私通私奔；或竟振振有詞與夫訴請離婚之訟；人生至此時此境，不亦大可哀乎！然則精力不足丈夫的自强之道若何？此據世界名醫及余經驗均以積極服生殖腺製劑「生殖素」最為對症特效。因此劑係根據醫學上最進步之補給療法之原理，採取健壯動物如猿猴，猩猩，虎狼，熊鹿，海狗等體中的生殖腺內分泌精華，用最新科學法儂縮複製成劑。所以此劑品質之貴重，功效之確實，為任何類似製劑所不及。男子於服後一日夜間即可生精補腎，健腦活血，尤貴不斷連服，則更助長發育，滋養神經，稠濃精血，必於短期內治愈各症，使精力倍增，中老年人常服，則延年益壽，返老還童。惟有遺精者，須兼服治遺特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」（中西五洲等大藥房及永安公司西藥部均售每匣實價兩元）以鞏固精關，制止遺洩，則收效尤為神速。余在美國研究性病特效療法時，曾與奧斯曼爾博士及威爾瓦特敎授等多人將此劑屢作臨床實驗，均有美滿的結果。回國後以此劑治愈患者亦不下十餘萬人，故特負責為之介紹。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3 id="c74">你的乳峯發育佳否？ <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>春光逝去莫能回！</p>
<p>健美喪失更可悲！</p>
<p>速將名藥求彌補，</p>
<p>巧奪天工亦快哉。</p>
<p>春天，固然美麗而可愛的，可是她匆匆地來了，而又匆匆地欲去了，雖然覺得美麗而可愛，但無法挽留，衹有徒給人們惆悵與感喟！</p>
<p>少女，也是美麗而可愛的，可是有許多乳峯萎癟健美喪失的少女，雖在妙齡年華，但她已似老去的秋光，絲毫不値得人們眷戀，倘一旦靑春消逝，玉容無華，那更其覺得可厭、可憎了！而且「春」究竟可以重回，美麗馥郁的花朵，今年萎謝了，明年又可重開，惟有號稱萬物之靈的人，靑春消逝，是無法挽回的。又似有了缺陷的人，如不設法彌補，那這個缺陷，便會愈缺愈陷的，說得明白點，例如乳峯萎癟，臀部瘦削，玉容憔悴，肌肉枯槁的不美女性，倘不及時以最對症的專藥挽救，那年齡漸增，衹有益增老醜，決不能因了年齡的增加，而自由恢復妳固有的美麗。</p>
<p>然則挽救此種缺陷的專藥，在今日之下，當以何藥最為對症而有效。此據中西著名的醫師與萬千服者一致的介紹，應推卵巢內分泌製劑女用「生殖素」為此中祭酒，蓋現在市上關於婦科的成藥雖多，但成分，功效，配製，均不逮女用「生殖素」速甚。此劑最特異而為人信仰驚奇者，就是於乳房一部發育，最具顯效，一經進服，除能調經止帶，却病强身外，能使萎癟的乳峯，在短期內立形聳起，若平時鬆弛下垂，狀態不美者，服後更能充實堅挺，成富有彈力之健美乳峯，人工巧奪天工，女用「生殖素」足以自豪矣。</p>
<h3 id="c75">遺精與疰夏的關係 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>有種身體衰弱的靑年，每到夏天，有所謂疰夏者。其實，疰夏並不是孤立的病症，多數是神經衰弱，貧血，腎呆的緣故，這種病症在天氣良好的時候，是感覺很輕徵。或　完全的不感覺，可是一至天氣火熱的夏天，那症象就很顯著了。常人不察其故，卽名之曰「疰夏」。</p>
<p>靑年人之身體，好像春天的苗木，應該很健壯而結實，而今神經何以會衰弱，血液何以會呆滯？這據醫學上的診斷：大半因曾犯自凟惡癖，或因縱慾斷傷，或久患遺精，因此，生命源泉的生殖腺內分泌液，即有逐漸枯竭之處！生殖腺內分泌液功能滋養神經，調整新陳代謝，、助長發育機能。若逐漸枯竭，神經亦卽逐漸衰弱，所以遺精患者，必有腦衰，健忘，失眠，心悸等症象，此即是腦神經衰弱的象徽。目眩，眼花，散光，近視等症象，此是視神經衰弱的象徵，胃部消化不良，食慾不振等症象，此是胃神經衰弱的象徽，若性神經衰弱者，則凡早洩，陽痿，精力渙散等症象不一而足。同時在皮膚，血液，肌肉等部的新陳代謝作用減退，則祗有老細胞的死去。而無新細胞的獲生，自然就面黃肌瘦，貧血早衰，發育不全等症象更相繼叢生，這樣的靑年，一至夏天，能有不疰夏者乎，恐怕疰夏尙是小瀝者也。其未來的前途，真是難以設想！欲謀補救與預防。唯有速即治愈其遺精。此時若服特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」，則必可常固精關，鎮靜神經，服後於當夜即可收安眠止遺之神效。已有上述症象者，須兼服健壯動物生殖腺　製劑「生殖素」以增補腦腎，精血及神經，則必可於短期內根治各症，健康增進，而永不疰夏。患者若能親來本診所診治，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3 id="c76">於無意中轉入慢性淋 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 淋病專科戴德醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：北京路四川路轉角</p>
<p>診時：上午九時到六時止</p>
<p>非常時期僅收號金四角</p>
<p>在初發之急性症狀，往往于不知不覺中轉入慢性淋者，以余歷年來經驗之結果，盡除淋菌而外，又多混有其他之病菌，尤其是起於桿菌者為多。患者之自覺症為尿道不快擾癢感，或於輕微的疼痛，始乞醫家診治。惟由於症状之輕微，故每使病家疏於治療與攝生</p>
<p>，故于不知不覺之間，將淋菌由前尿道侵入後尿道，遂致惹起攝護腺炎，精囊炎，睪丸炎，膀胱炎，及全身傳染之關節炎等，始知自己之病非但未癢，反而已趨惡化。</p>
<p>有時，此等症狀，其尿液並不完全溷濁，多呈透明色，或略帶少許之淋系而已。但是實際上此等塲所，恒在無意之中，傳染於異性，故已有妻子之丈夫，尤不可不留意於此等慢性淋之症狀，而求其即日治愈。凡是遇到此等症狀時，必須用尿液培養後，反覆檢查，或行攝護腺按摩法，將其漓出之液體，用顯微鏡檢查之，必能發見淋菌及其他桿菌，而確定淋病之所在，然後按症而治，庶幾百發百中，在治療方法上言之，則首推德國濾淋平流常療法，以其導子插入尿道內部，然後按病情之輕重而開放電度，使殺菌力直接透射病灶，適可而止。並擇用德國希氏血淸，以抗淋殺菌免疫，他如洗滌法，按摩法，冷却法，混湯法等，皆可按症而施，則凡如此等症之慢性淋，四五星期即可根治也</p>

<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌悉無上落、英美匯暗市、先鬆後回、終則軋軟、情況較爲活潑、初以投機商狂塞、價遂漫鬆不止、四月份英金竟做過四辦士一五六二五、惟聞滙豐吃胃頓佳、英金四辦士一四〇六二五之價吸入頗多、故至午刻、投機商等見景忽轉賣為買、遂起緊風、午後仍因投機商扒進、且先令供給缺乏、潛勢步軟、結果收盤英金四辦士一二五、美滙六元〇三一二五、較隔昨各緊〇一五六二五與〇三一二五、期貨趨勢與現貨一般、</p>
<p>開市甚形鬆動</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均長一八七五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬法等各匯俱平、美對英漲二分一二五、對滬不動、對法大一分一二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士一四〇六二五、美匯六元〇六二五、較之隔昨晚收、英美兩匯均平、同時期貨開出亦無更動、開後賣風即起、投機商售出最夥、市面隨見硬化、計投機商賣予外行四月份美匯六元〇九三七五、以至六元一二五之鬆價、又同時塞予外行五月份美匯爲五元八七五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉升一元五角五分、嗣投機商仍不斷吐出　且有利及外行等亦懷賣意、惟華新大陸等稍有結進、時四月份央金外行納入投機商已告四辦士七一五六二五、詎至十點左右、華商本月期多　漸在了結清楚、賣風平息之際、銀行納胃突佳、有利吐予華行大陸五月份美匯五元八四三七五及八一二五、較前微形回軟、後投機商止塞、更聞匯豐吸胃轉旺、市象立即轉緊、迄午收、英金爲四辦士一二五、美匯爲六元〇三一二五、較明開反縮〇一五六二五與〇二一二五、期貨亦緊、</p>
<p>英美期現轉緊</p>
<p>午後市面尚告穩定、開後投機商購進外行五月份美匯五元八一二五、並六月份美匯五元五九三七五、惟現貨先令爲狀略軟、治至晚收、結果英金四辦士一二五、美匯六元〇三一二五、五月份英金三辦士九八四三七五、美匯五元八一二五、六月份英金英金三辦士八四三七五、美匯五元五六二五、較上日現貨英軟〇一五六二五、美緊〇三一二五、五月份英美均縮〇三一二五、六月份英美亦均軟〇三一二五、</p>

<p>昨日外幣市況、始以鎊價突長二分一二五、黑市外匯　鬆、金價還至五千五百元關邊、致英美金鎊賡續下落、美金票曾還至十六元一角一分、此後則因關於流通劵之傳說、於是金價急進轉漲、外匯頓　緊俏、外幣買氣陡盤、迫至午刻、美金票已高至十六元四角、午後曾續高至十六元四角半、後稍挫至十六元三角七分、比上日軋漲一角七分、英美金鎊迄至晚市、各高二元五角、英金票需要不弱、市價挺漲、香港票隨港滬匯兌微漲五厘、法郎票供給漸減、市價站穩、坎拿大票稍有需要、僅漲一角、　日金票及朝鮮票又趨低落、前者又退爲一元二角六分、後者復降爲九角八分五厘、</p>

<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市況各債均徐上漲、初因四十一號忽有一四十萬進胃、因此又引起各散戶空頭之抵補、同時因金價轉漲、謠言隨起、或謂金庫將實行、亦謂僞銀行將成立、雖明知向壁虛構、但此種空氣最足以波動市面、各債之好半基於此、但仍無法證明、故下午又稍回疲、昨上午、四十一號照市收購、大通鴻大仁昌豐大隨之、或補空、或做多、市價上騰甚勁、聯和同順潤利及零星散戶雖有賣出、而買氣仍濃、甲種必衝出九元、午後交易已清、市價平疲、聯和聯益協大泰豐等均有賣出、結果已好起　角半至六角、成交約八十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交大達輪船公司股、五十股、價爲六十二元、昨日衆業股市之精華、全爲英聯所佔盡、成交六萬九十股、價自五十五元奔騰至六十一元半、收盤六十元、業廣·中國墾殖·揚子·怡和等亦附驥尾而前　、成交數僅次於英聯、會得豐股開盤時有孤戶（即無人躍進之謂）出範於一百七十元左右低價、不久買者紛紛來購、立被抬拉至一百九十九元、收盤價爲一百九十七元半買進、以昨日成交額依價計値、英聯股超過四百萬元、而會德豐股成交亦有一百五十萬元之譜、自來火股購者吸胃奇佳、蓋據傳其過剩房產之出賣手續、業已辦理竣事也、</p>

<p>本棉交易斷絕、惟印棉成交尚能支持、然亦盡係同行買賣、廠方安然勿動、所以市面無甚精彩、惟趨勢仍昂耳茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉布、昨日晨初即形活躍、然殊平穩、緽後因同業之購買、及海外棉商之購買、邃期漲三磅音、印度棉市因市上盛傳印日正在談判、以日本之棉紗棉布易取印棉之說各方異常興奮、故昨日連同預測漲起七羅比餘、埃及昨日停市、</p>

<p>達人之言曰：「見怪不怪，甚怪目絕。」古之聖人，遇有非常之事，恒聿修歐德，以期轉怪戾而為祥和也。夫子以言立教，怪在所不語；而春秋一書，二百四十二年之間，所記災異者，一百二十有二，在天則為薄蝕隕孛，在地則為震動崩圯，在物則為　蜮鵒　，而李梅草菽寒暑之節有違，雨雹震電時令之宜或爽，豕啼龍鬥，蛇出石言，或人事先見，亦異應之；或妖孽先兆，災禍隨之，無非欲人恐懼修省也。左傳所謂：妖由人興，人無釁焉，妖不自作，人　常妖生。蓋其氣燄有以致之也。所謂國家將興，必有禎祥；國家將亡，必有妖孽，惟至誠乃能先知，亦　至誠，乃能戒慎也。故德足以勝之，雖雊雉祥桑，亦不為災也；德不足以當之，即龍現麟出，亦屬不祥也。反常即怪，禮義廉恥不知，孝悌忠信之不講，曉然而言，貿然而行，明有人非，幽有鬼　，天理所當殛，王法所不容，災禍之來，有可拭目以俟，何怪如之！</p>

<p>我們人人都需要說話的才能，我們說話，同時卽對自己負有重大責任，因爲說話的才能，是一種的幾會，也是一種的危險。人說的話不好，能破壞自己的名譽，離散自己的朋友，說的話好，也能使整個環境蒙受好的影響，故說話的才能是十分重要的。即可幫助自己。如果不好。出能阻礙自己，使徒雅各在他所寫的書信中，曾說得很明白，他說「我們若把嚼環放在馬嘴裏，叫他順服，就能調動他的全身，船隻雖然大，又被大風催逼，只用小小的舵，就隨得掌舵的意思轉動，這樣，舌頭在百體裏，也是最小的，却能說大話，燃起大火，各類的走獸，飛禽，昆蟲，水族，本來都可以制服，惟獨舌頭，沒有人能制服。」若　君是聰明有充分知識的人，他在言論上，即能表現出他的智慧和謙卑。說話人人會，但是要緊的問題却在我們所說的是否有價值。我們試看耶蘇怎樣運用他說話的才能。耶蘇是傳敎士，常常要說話，並且說的很長，他明白這裏面有特權，也有危險。所以他對自己所說的話，和怎樣說法，很是當心。我們當學習耶蘇的榜樣，從每日所說的話上，表現出自己的智慧，知識，和謙卑。第一點我們看出耶蘇知道何時當閉口不言。聖書上關於他的緘默不言。記述多次。他爲何緘默，就是因爲他知道何時不宜說話。「如羊被牽到屠宰塲，如綿羊在剪羊毛的人面前不發一言。」人鞭打他，譏笑他，釘他在十字架上，他絕不回口，只求上帝饒恕他們。（待續）　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3 id="c118">如何紀念勞動節 <a href="#c118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— 紀方</p>
<p>五月，是一個多事月份，綜計「五一」爲國際勞動紀念節日，「五三」濟南慘案紀念日，「五四」青年節，「五五」國民政府成立紀念日，他如「五九」，「五一八」，「五卅」等許多日子，沒有一天不都屬含義深遠和沈痛悲憤的民族革命奮鬬的紀念日。</p>
<p>今天　，是民國二十九年度五月的第一天，也就是國際勞動紀念節日的一天。當然，在這一天裏，全世界各國的勞動工作者，均將舉行深深的紀念和緬懷以往奮鬬掙扎的成功，然而，我人處茲現實環境比較特殊的上海，將如何來紀念勞動節的今天，固必有其不容磨減的深刻印象；同時筆者還願乘此勞動紀念的佳節，敢向本市勞資階級雙方進附一言，也就是代申說紀念勞動節的深長意義罷了。</p>
<p>我們知道，上海是中國的巴黎，其繁榮着出可不加思索的明瞭了。然而，這是「八一三」以前的情形，在經過「八一三」砲火戰神的洗刷以後，繁榮的情形是倒退了，縱使說在表面上或者較前更爲景氣者，那是畸形的現象，在實質上正可說逐漸地踏上沒落敗退的過程中，因爲如此，一切的情形，都較前要困難上許多，而尤其是表現在工商業的生產不多，風險鉅大，人民日常生活程度的激盪於萬分緊張的無限主潮中逐浪着爲可怕。</p>
<p>最近來，因了這種種原因，致工商業各界的勞咨雙方，時在摩擦不安的景象中，血所調罷工的風潮，也隨時隨地都在醞釀，大有一觸即發之勢。但是，我們退一步來說，一種工商業的所以能興盛，完全要靠在勞資雙方的能合作協謀到如何地步以爲決定的，雖然在今天工廠中，因了運輸的不便，原料來處之不易和成本增加加關係，致影響到生產，但是爲了應付現實困難的環境，事業本身和勞者的生計着想，是萬萬不能有無意經營的一天；反之，在許多的勞工方面，誠也爲了生活品價格的激增起見，對於以往菲薄的薪職或每日工作的進款，在在都是不够維持，然而亦只能顧全國家民族的艱鉅目標的達成和整個環境局勢的限制，對於工廠當局，又不能不明瞭他們的苦衷以後，在，中提出合理的要求，萬不該受人縱使，有意爲難。因爲，上海的今日，除了生活高潮的激刺以外，更隨處多的是落人的陷阱，這希望勞資雙方，於今日勞動紀念節的緬懷追憶中，是必須看清認識的頂重要點子。所以，如何來紀念勞動節，便不能不注力於社會上的作來價，資方可能範圍內的自動增資，勞動者的能實行節約，能相互樂業，以共渡此艱難困苦的環境。</p>
<h3 id="c119">上海工人的生活調查 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 大川</p>
<p>上海自「八一三」戰事爆發以後，各大工廠曾一度停頓，但不久形勢稍定，外商工廠多數恢復原有的規模。去年歐戰再起，上海各工厰，頓受刺激，產銷益形旺盛，工人人數激增，幾與戰前相等，但是幾乎有百分之七十以上的工人，都在楊樹浦和滬西區工作，所以關心勞工神福利的人們，都對他們予以十分的關懷。</p>
<p>在被封鎖的孤島上，　生活指數一天天的增高起來，若與戰前相比較，一超過四倍速左右，在這咱情形之下，工人的生活，實在是最堪注意的。</p>
<p>第一，讓我們來看看男女工人的工資，據滬東化社托兒所調查四十五緣工人家庭結果；男工每月工資的平均數（Mean）是一九·〇五元，女工是一七·八元，較戰前僅加兩三元。這種被調查的工人，大都在楊樹浦英商相日商紗廠工作，所以這個統計，有相當正確性。假使夫妻二人，都入廠工作，那麼，每月所入，平均也不過四六·八五元，何况夫妻兩方都有失業的呢。又據統計：在四十五家工人家庭中，每家平均人數是二·七人，其中一家四人者，有十八家，佔最多數；一家三人者有十二家，佔次多數，可見此種家庭，均甚簡單，大槪以來自內地鄉間爲多，其中倘有父母兒女留居家鄉，必可按月寄歸家用者，亦不乏人。茲姑以每家月入四六·八五元爲根據，則每月需伙食最少三十五元，房租最少八元，所餘二元八角五分叫他們做什麼用處？何况家鄉還有年老的父母和嗷嗷待哺的兒女？而隨身帶着的兒女，在白天裏無人照顧，在看護和敎育上又是一個極磊的問題。</p>
<p>其次，他們的工作時間也是不合法的。男工每日工作時間平均爲九小時三十七分鍾，女工是十一小時十七分鍾。後者大都每晨五時，必須離家，五時半開始工作，至下午六時方可放工，有許多還要每個一星期做七天夜工。</p>
<p>所以我們很希望：第一，如工廠貨物價格增高，工人的工資也應依照比例予以提高；第二，各種日用品的價格，應予抑低，至少在接受商人請求加價時，要加以十二分的考慮，如能做到這二點，那麼，工人的生活或可以楔於合理化。</p>

<h3 id="c122">「大破納粹間諜網」攝製經過 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>轟傳一時的華納反德鉅片「大破納粹間諜網」Confessions　of　A　Nazispy將於明日起在滬光大戲院公映。因此，筆者特把華納攝製這部影片的經過情形，約略的寫述一些</p>
<p>反德前鋒</p>
<p>去年春天，好萊塢影片公司開始發表將大量攝製反德和反法西斯蒂影片的計劃。一時好萊塢的影片，也可代表美國的影片，全以商業爲出發點，不含政治作用的，這是片商的傳統政策。但自從這項消息傳出之後使一般人都理會到好萊塢的影片，開始傾向到政治方面了。這裏面，尤其是華納，被認爲反德的前鋒。不過事後有許多製片，這是停止拍攝，而衹有華納，依然照常進行。真不愧爲反德前鋒而華納的第一砲，就是「大破納粹間諜網」呢！</p>
<p>故事內容</p>
<p>「大破納粹間諜網」的故事是描寫德國間諜在美國活動的情形。這故事並不出於杜撰，是根據美國法庭上納粹間諜所實招的口供。暴露德國在國際方面的陰謀。同時對於國社黨的虐待猶太人，也有述及，無非對於猶太難民表示同情。所以攝成之後一般影評人都以爲不但每一個美國人都應去看，就是世界各國，凡是民主國家的人民，都值得去看這部影片的。</p>
<p>攝制經過</p>
<p>華納攝製「大破納粹間諜網」，所經過的時間，也有一年之久。對於這部影片的處理，是特別的審慎。同時要顧全美國的外交政策，所以不能地究的强調。在攝製的時候，攝影塲特別戒嚴，閒雜的人們一槪不准進出，連得新聞記者也不能去參觀。有許多演員，連故事的內容也不知道底細，直到全部工作完成後才知道故事始末的。華納防備的嚴密，卻此可想而知了。</p>

<p>並聞世善在更新不日約滿北行，該兩票房將於其臨別紀念之最後三日再度定座往觀，而世善今茲載譽歸去，於海上人士留一絕佳之印象，亦可謂不虛此行矣。</p>

<p>銀都人造溜冰塲定於今日開　，在前夜記者被邀參觀，去見識見識這個人造冰的玩意兒，我們一溜進門，只見塲面的佈置還相當玲瓏，設備尚稱新穎，有上空氣調節器通風機的裝置，四周一圈是客座，足容二三百來賓，正前掛着幔幕，中央溜池裏是一人塊灰白的結晶地板，蒙經理羅君工程師葛君招待，葛君還指示說：他研究人造冰已有兩年，今天總算成功了，我們便踏進溜池鑑賞一下，冰呢，是某種化學結晶。像大理石面較灰黯，重重踐踏冰面略有粉以屑，剝了一張，放在手裏，又像　梨高膏糖，　說這裏的面積是四十方尺，冰重三萬磅，計有二吋多厚，特備刀型溜冰鞋，溜在這人造冰上能旋轉自如，毫無雜聲　　我們又向四周流覽着，望望入口處的閃爍的紅綠燈光，撫摸脚下的冰屑，心中怪覺熱烘烘地。</p>

<p>Changsha, 29th night: The Hua army in Southern Hubei, Northern Hunan, and Northern Jiangxi launched a full-scale offensive, taking advantage of their victories to fiercely annihilate the Japanese. The advance was extremely rapid and the gains were substantial. (Dispatch from the 30th)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Japanese army on the south bank of the Yangtze River launched several attacks on Longgang Town and Jiugong Mountain in recent days but were repelled by the Hua army. On the 27th and 28th, two groups of Japanese troops surged from the vicinity of Yueyang and Tongcheng, advancing along separate routes toward Xishan (east of Yueyang) and Jiuling Mountain (east of Tongcheng). On the 28th and 29th, they engaged in fierce fighting with the Hua army near Qushandong, south of Xishan, with over 800 Japanese soldiers and over 160 warhorses killed.

<h3 id="e10">Today's Labor Day in China <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Today is Labor Day, transcending borders and ethnicities.</p>
<p>We deeply rejoice in this excellent opportunity to express our sincere respect and love to the working class throughout China. This is not a momentary feeling, nor is it a private statement from a single newspaper or individual; the working class in China today is truly in a position most worthy of sympathy. The future will differ from the present, other countries will differ from China, and other sectors will differ from the working class; these are the characteristics of this day, this country, and this sector, which should be recognized by anyone with a conscience and sympathized with by anyone with a conscience. Therefore, we express our heartfelt thoughts to the working class of China and hope to awaken the conscience of anyone towards the Chinese working class.</p>
<p>China's war of resistance is a sacred war; China's nation-building is a sacred mission and a sacred undertaking. How do we know it is sacred? Because the motivation for resistance and nation-building is based on justice, peace, and universal love; the process of resistance and nation-building is consistent with justice, peace, and universal love; and the achievements and contributions of resistance and nation-building will contribute to justice, peace, and universal love. Therefore, we regard it as sacred without doubt, and we uphold it with a clear conscience. The working class's efforts and great contributions to modern civilization are well known, hence the term "sacred labor." Indeed, blood and sweat are exchanged for wages, and wages maintain life, which is vastly different from obtaining without labor. Moreover, the labor is hard, but the rewards are meager. Therefore, the working class lives in the modern world with their heads held high and looking down on the masses. However, examining the objective results, they may be coerced and become tools of the coercers, or they may be poisoned and help to increase the evils of the poisoners. For example, the working class of an aggressor nation is not responsible for the guilt of aggression, but without their blood and sweat, what would the leaders of aggression rely on to invade? Similarly, the working class of other nations may deeply hate the crimes of aggressor nations, but their economic supply and demand with aggressor nations, even their trade in arms and raw materials, continues unabated, with the blood and sweat of the working class being the main factor. Therefore, the so-called "sacred labor" in various countries sometimes becomes a cohort of evil. Comparing this to the complete unity of China's sacred resistance and nation-building, the officers and soldiers are the combatants on the front lines, and the working class is the backbone of the combatants. Not only is the subjective consciousness of their operations constantly focused on resistance and nation-building, but every stage of their operations also fully embodies the sacred meaning.</p>
<p>But what does the reality of the Chinese working class seem like? They are subjected to various forms of threats and inducements, and various restrictive situations. As a result, some are separated from the sacred cause of resistance and nation-building, and some even endure humiliation and waste their blood and sweat, their operations directly or indirectly contradicting the cause of resistance and nation-building. This is especially true in the occupied areas. In terms of judging merit and crime based on conscience, the great righteousness is clear and leaves no room for excuses. However, if we consider the circumstances, they are not without pity. As for the vast majority of the Chinese working class, in reality, they have done their best and made great contributions. In terms of their methods, it is still labor and reward. However, they can barely maintain their minimum normal living standards. The soaring prices are well known, but the working class has no connection with these prices. The wages earned in a month are not enough to pay for a stone of grain. A family of several people can only seek to avoid hunger, but cannot even achieve that. How can the working class inquire about other goods? People may say that only beggars die of cold and hunger, but the working class does not reach this point. It must be known that pawning to make up for the deficit is essentially destroying their past assets; borrowing to make up for the deficit is essentially consuming their future income; engaging in extra work to make up for the deficit is essentially drawing on their physical strength and lifespan in advance; and driving the elderly, weak, women, and children to seek small gains to make up for the deficit is essentially exploiting and sacrificing their families' past and future. These are the common and real phenomena of the Chinese working class. Being born as Chinese people and living in this great era, they endure hardship, regard death as homecoming, each fulfilling their position and their natural duty, of course, without any complaints. However, the soaring prices are not entirely a natural phenomenon of this great era. There are often unreasonable and illegal forms of greed that cause it. In this context of soaring prices, those who take advantage of the workers' blood and sweat to get rich are unknown in number. Such injustice cannot be concealed by the fact that it is a local phenomenon. In peacetime or in other countries, this would at least lead to local strikes or even trigger some kind of labor movement. Improving labor conditions is a demand within the scope of the rights of the working class, and rising prices are a legitimate reason for the general demand to improve labor conditions. Although the Chinese working class today is living in difficult circumstances, they are under the great righteousness of resistance and nation-building, so they endure all kinds of hardships and grievances. These hardships and grievances can be known without deeply inquiring into the working class, but simply asking how much the daily wages are and how much a pound of grain costs will give one the utmost sympathy for the working class. Given the workers' endurance, the general social sympathy, the peaceful coexistence in this great era, and the thought of the post-war reconstruction, we cannot but place high hopes on capitalists and entrepreneurs, recognizing that the working class is the backbone of the combatants in resistance and nation-building. They must uphold conscience, exert their abilities, and at all times and in all matters, consider the welfare that the working class deserves. It must be known that the so-called labor and capital in China, from today's wartime to the future post-war period, are by no means two opposing classes, but permanent partners who must be harmonious with each other. This is to establish a foundation of mutual respect and love through sharing the hardships of wartime, and also to learn from the lessons of the war that China's backwardness in all industries must be overcome by mutual respect and love between labor and capital so that they can encourage each other to catch up quickly.</p>

<p>Chongqing: Today, the Central Daily News published a special report, describing the newspaper's reporter's interview with foreign correspondents residing in Chongqing, asking them about their observations on the European war. According to Hsingk, a correspondent from the German News Agency who returned here last week from Berlin via Moscow, Germany would not invade Sweden because it was not a necessary action. The war in Norway would end in three to four weeks with the withdrawal of British and French troops. Italy's participation in the war was only a matter of time, but that time had not yet come. Germany's biggest target was Britain, so Germany had no intention of violating the neutrality of Belgium and the Netherlands. At present, Germany did not want the Soviet Union to participate in the war. A political understanding between Germany and the Soviet Union might be brewing into a military alliance, but the time had not yet come. According to Max, a correspondent from Havas, Germany might invade Sweden, but would face strong resistance. Italy might not participate in the war because it could not gain anything from participating and risked being attacked by France. Germany might try to invade France through the Netherlands and Belgium, but those two countries had strong defenses, and if they were invaded, France would provide assistance. According to Jacque Shamin, a correspondent from the Soviet TASS News Agency, the Soviet Union would strictly maintain neutrality. He believed that Germany was very likely to control Norway, and this situation would affect Sweden's position. Italy would not take any action. Mr. Sthavin refused to make any criticisms, only saying that the war in Northern Europe might not end in the short term. (Dispatch from Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>Chongqing – According to German news agency representative Xing Ke, who spoke to guests here, relations between Japan and Germany have indeed gradually cooled. Germans now understand that Japan is preoccupied with its operations in China and cannot assist Germany in the European war. Japanese ships no longer load goods for Germany or carry German passengers of military age, which has caused resentment among Germans. Xing Ke also said that the Germans had hoped Japan would attack Hong Kong or Singapore, but now realize that Japan is unable to do so. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Involving the European War Situation</p>
<p>Chongqing – Xing Ke, the representative of the German News Agency, arrived in Chongqing by plane from Berlin via Moscow. He discussed the European war situation and his journey, saying that there are about 100,000 German troops in Norway, most of whom landed in Oslo. When German troops began to invade Norway, they used 3,000 airplanes to transport soldiers and military supplies to Norway day and night, each plane carrying 30 people each time. He believes that Germany's control of Norway is important to the final outcome of the European war: (1) Germany can freely use the Atlantic Ocean to maintain transportation with overseas areas; (2) Germany will use the Norwegian coast as a base to attack England and also to attack British naval and air force bases. He believes that German troops will not attack Sweden, violate the neutrality of Holland and Belgium, or expand the war to the Balkans, because it is in Germany's interest not to expand the war zone. When the Soviet-Finnish War broke out, Germany concentrated a large army along its southern Baltic coast, preparing to set sail by ship if the Allies intervened in the Finnish war. This army was carefully selected and skilled in mountain warfare. Germany is now deeply convinced that it will win the final victory because the Allies can no longer blockade Germany, and Romania is unwilling to get involved in the war because its country would be destroyed if it participated in the war and its trade with Germany would also be lost. At one point, there was intense suspicion between Italy and the Soviet Union, but after Germany's mediation, the Soviet Union assured Italy that it would not take any action in the Balkans. He believes that when the Italian air force heavily damaged the British fleet in the North Sea, it would likely join the German side to weaken British naval power in the Mediterranean.

<p>Lisbon – Regarding the dispute between Portuguese police and Japanese troops on Lapa Island near Macau, the Colonial Department here issued a statement saying, "Since this dispute occurred, there have been many rumors. The Portuguese government is now clarifying the situation to set the record straight. The issue of sovereignty over Lapa Island has long been under negotiation between the Chinese and Portuguese governments. After the island, which belongs to a part of China, was occupied by Japanese troops, the Portuguese authorities dispatched police to occupy another part that should belong to Portugal. When the dispute occurred, three of our African Moorish police officers suddenly went missing, but there were no deaths or injuries. Regarding this matter, the Portuguese government will lodge a protest and necessary representations with the Japanese government to protect Portuguese rights." (Havas, 30th)</p>

<p>Tokyo – According to the "Chugai Commercial News," the Japan Youth Association, in order to prevent merchants nationwide from illegal trading, monopolization, and profiteering, and to assist the government in maintaining morale during the China Incident, plans to organize a Youth Commercial Patriotic Corps and has established a preparatory committee to draft a plan. It will first mobilize about half of the Youth Association members, estimated at 1.5 million, and will begin organizing in Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, and Kobe in May, and then extend to other regions. Regarding the progress of the work, the Youth Association will consult with the Ministries of Education, Health and Welfare, and Commerce and Industry, as well as the Planning Board. The following two matters are already being planned: (1) Each corps should establish a night school so that members can study current economic and spiritual issues, and guide their private lives to be consistent with wartime national policy; (2) Promote practical actions to prevent merchants nationwide from engaging in illegal trading, monopolization, and profiteering. In addition, the corps will also encourage national savings and assist the nationwide silver collection movement. (Havas, 29th)</p>

<h3 id="e25">British Newspaper Calls for Establishing Air Superiority with the Aim of Cutting Off German Transportation <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>London – According to special reports, several newspapers here have reiterated that if the Allies want to overcome the initial advantages gained by German troops in their fraudulent attack on Norway, they must quickly establish air superiority in Norway. The newspapers insisted that the war in Norway is difficult, but the final victory will undoubtedly belong to the Allies. The Allied forces' defeat of the attacking German troops north of Stenkjer is an encouraging factor. One or two other newspapers eagerly hope that Prime Minister Chamberlain will firmly announce that despite the various difficulties in the war in Norway, it can and will proceed without being discouraged. The Times newspaper said, "The Allied forces are now going through a severe test period. Although they are still unable to join the garrison in Trondheim, it is not easy for the German troops to prevent them from making contact. We now control the sea from this coast to that coast, so the Allied forces' actions have gained greater freedom. However, to extend this freedom to the entire theater of war, in addition to naval power, air superiority is also needed to coordinate with each other. Therefore, establishing air superiority is an urgent task in the entire war in Norway." British soldiers in Norway are fighting under extremely difficult circumstances, but this has been understood by the people of the Allied countries, so they are not discouraged at all. The British people have always strengthened their resolve when the difficulties ahead are clearly visible. This spirit was particularly great when the news of the war in Norway was particularly unfavorable last week. The Daily Telegraph also insisted on the various difficulties encountered by the Allied forces in Norway, but the Allied navies' power to cut off German transportation will still be one of the main features of the war. The newspaper also said, "We are still far from our goal. The Allied countries will use their maximum efforts in the sea, land, and air to inflict a miserable defeat on the German troops and punish them for their atrocities in Norway." (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>Stockholm – Regarding the war in Norway, according to the latest news, German troops are attacking the Allied positions between Dombas and Trondheim in four directions: (1) In the Gudbrandsdalen River valley, the town of Kvam is currently occupied by German troops, while the town of Otta is in the hands of the Allies, and the two sides are fighting between the two towns; (2) German troops are advancing along the Otta River and the Folla River towards Hjerkinn. The Allied forces are resisting strongly seven or eight miles outside the town; (3) German troops are attacking along the highway from Tynset to Osberget, clashing with Norwegian troops in the town of Kvikne, and fierce battles are still ongoing; (4) German troops have occupied the highway from Røros to Støren. In addition, the war is also ongoing in the northern Narvik area. As for the Stenkjer front, French troops have made contact with Norwegian troops, and are working together to attack the German troops with considerable success. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – According to the latest news, German troops advancing through the mountains south of Trondheim have engaged Allied forces in new positions: one at Hejkin on the railway north of Dombas, and the other at Kvikne, northeast of Hejkin. Since German troops were blocked by British troops on the direct route to the Gudbrandsdalen valley, they sent out two motorized units, advancing along the two highways originating from the Østerdalen valley, in order to cut off the railway behind the British positions. The first of these two highways passes through the Folla valley to Hejkin, which is held by British troops, and the British troops have been reinforced to meet the enemy troops. At Kvikne, the second of these two locations, Norwegian troops are confronting German troops. The details of the battles at these two points are currently unknown, but a large-scale engagement is expected. The German troops in the Gudbrandsdalen valley, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, have reportedly been dispersed by British defenders who attacked around Kvam. British troops are currently defending positions resembling bottlenecks in the upper part of the valley. Several German aircraft flew north over the Røros area, indicating that Germany is sending troops to Trondheim. German aircraft are still bombing the Allied forces arriving south of Trondheim to reinforce, but anti-aircraft guns have made it impossible for enemy aircraft to fly below 9,000 feet, so enemy aircraft are currently unable to attack at will. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London – According to the latest news, the situation is quite good for the Allied forces in Narvik port in northern Norway, and their positions in Namsos port in the central region are also very stable, but they are in a rather difficult situation in the town of Dombas. Fresh British and French troops landed in Narvik port and immediately moved to the front to reinforce, continuing to advance towards the enemy troops. Looking back on yesterday, the Allied forces fought fiercely. The enemy troops repeatedly attacked between Otta and Dombas, but were repelled by the Allied forces, and many tanks were lost. Many fortifications were also destroyed, but the German troops still made progress, so the Allied forces have suffered significant losses in one area. According to unconfirmed news, the city of Røros has fallen, but the city of Hjerkinn is still held by Allied forces and remains unmoved. In addition, according to sources in Sweden, the city of Støren has also fallen, but this has not yet been confirmed. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German High Command issued a communiqué stating that German troops are advancing along various routes to Trondheim and Dombas, repelling the enemy whenever they are encountered. German troops in the mountains are continuing to operate, also with considerable success. A Norwegian infantry regiment northwest of Lillehammer, consisting of 2,500 men, surrendered to the German troops along with their commander. Enemy troops landing in Namsos and Åndalsnes were heavily damaged by German aircraft bombings, with six enemy ships sunk and several others severely damaged. German troops also sunk two enemy submarines in the Skagerrak and Kattegat. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin – An official communiqué issued this afternoon stated that German troops departing north from Oslo via Tynset and German troops departing south from Trondheim met today west of Støren, and land transport from Oslo to Trondheim is now unobstructed. (Haidong, 30th)</p>
<p>Berlin – A battle report issued today by the German High Command stated that enemy troops retreated yesterday on all routes to Trondheim and Dombas. Our army used Otta as a base to pursue enemy troops in Dombas, capturing a large amount of military equipment. The Bergen area war is also progressing very rapidly. The 2,500 men of the Fourth Norwegian Infantry Regiment retreated into the mountains and have now surrendered to our army in Lillehammer. Our army is pursuing the enemy eastward from Bergen, using Voss as a base, capturing 260 people and five artillery pieces. The enemy's landing operations in Namsos and Åndalsnes were severely hampered by our air force bombing, sinking six ships. One British aircraft was shot down by our army northwest of Kristiansand the day before yesterday. Two or three enemy submarines were destroyed by us in the Skagerrak and Kattegat areas. There is no special military news on the Western Front. (Haidong, 3rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm – It is said that Allied troops are landing continuously in Norway at the original landing sites and new locations, and are entering Norway. According to news from Namsos, the Allied heavy troops include Polish and Czech legions. It is generally believed that the number of German troops currently arriving in Norway is not as large as that of the Allied troops, because German troops mostly arrive in Norway by plane, only fighting 30 or 40 people each time, and it is said that Germany uses coastal boats to transport troops, each boat cannot accommodate more than 50 or 100 people. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Allied Forces Head to Dombas to Reinforce</p>
<p>Stockholm – Regarding the war situation in Norway, observers here recently commented that the center of gravity of the war is now between Dombas and Trondheim in the central region. After the Allied forces continued to land in Åndalsnes port, they immediately divided into two routes, north and south, heading to Dombas to reinforce. The southern route army has arrived in Lillehammer, and the northern route army is consolidating positions in Dalsburg and Hjerkinn. Koppang is an important railway transportation hub and is of great military importance. It is expected that a large-scale war will soon occur there. Generally speaking, the war in Norway is still in the experimental stage, and there is no fixed front line, so a real war has not yet occurred. According to an Allied officer, military operations at this time are essentially strategic and tactical actions, so there is no victory or defeat to speak of. German troops and Allied troops are now moving separately into the Norwegian interior. The current problem is not to defeat the enemy, but to send as many troops as possible to land, occupy important railway highways, cities, and strategic strongholds. Because at the beginning of the war, Germany relied on its motorized units, which was quite convenient, but until now, fresh troops have been landing in Norway continuously and gradually becoming effective in resisting the German army's attacks in the air. Although Germany has several airfields, some of which have been bombed by the Allied forces, there are still some that can be used, which is much more convenient than the British Air Force, which must use its own bases. Fortunately, Allied aircraft have recently been able to use the frozen lakes of Norway, and at the same time, they have stepped up the construction of airfields, so the overall situation will soon change. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>German Offensive Blocked by Allied Forces</p>
<p>London – A message was recently broadcast by a radio station affiliated with the British Broadcasting Corporation: (1) German troops near Stenkjer in northern Norway were repeatedly attacked and repelled by our army, suffering heavy losses. The positions on the Gudbrandsdal River are still being held. The two cities of Namsos and Molde were heavily bombed by German aircraft. The two cities of Namsos and Stenkjer were also repeatedly bombed by German aircraft and have become a burnt ground. (2) German troops in the east are moving towards Røros, but all bridges have been destroyed by the Norwegian army, which has blocked them. They have also been blocked by the Norwegian army south of Trondheim. As for the Kvam and Osdalen River basins, although enemy air forces are bombing fiercely, the German offensive has been blocked by Allied forces. (3) German transport fleets in the Skagerrak Strait have suffered heavy losses. German troops have repeatedly attempted to land in the strait but have failed. According to unofficial sources, a German ship (3,000 tons) has sunk between the island of Zealand in Denmark and the Scandinavian Peninsula. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Allied Anti-Aircraft Guns Arrive on Shore</p>
<p>London – Reuters military correspondents claim that the German army is now using in Norway the same tactic that was successful in Poland: sending aircraft to bomb railway junctions and docks in order to disrupt Allied transportation, and dropping large numbers of bombs at low altitude to prevent reserve troops from landing. The most eager hope of the German side is to prevent the transportation of anti-aircraft guns to shore, because without the resistance of anti-aircraft guns, German aircraft can fly at low altitude. However, it is heard that a large number of Allied anti-aircraft guns have arrived on shore, so the position of the Allied bases has become more stable. The Allied positions in Narvik have indeed become stronger and stronger because their transportation has not been cut off and the Allied forces can move freely. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Støren's Military Importance</p>
<p>London – According to news from the capital of Sweden, there have been reports that Støren in central Norway has fallen, but this has not yet been confirmed. The city is located south of Trondheim and has a railway that goes directly to the port. As it is a transportation hub and a military stronghold, if the Allied forces can hold the city, German troops landing in Oslo will be unable to head to Trondheim to reinforce. Therefore, it is generally believed that the war will be centered on Støren. However, the British Broadcasting Corporation issued a message this afternoon saying that there has been no major change in the war situation in Norway. Allied forces are still able to hold their positions in the Gudbrandsdalen River and Oslo River basins, preventing the enemy from making any progress. British aircraft have also been heavily bombing German airfields in Norway. In addition, according to news from Sweden, Allied forces are now landing in two inlets on the Norwegian coast, one in Norddalen Bay, which has a highway that leads directly to Dombas, and one in Sundalsøra, which also has a road that leads directly to Støren. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Only British Warships Dock Along the Norwegian Coast</p>
<p>London – According to a captain of a large seaplane patrol team on the British coast, there are virtually no ships of other countries other than British warships along the Norwegian coast. It is almost certain that the German fresh troops are transported to Norway by air. At the same time, the country may still have a part of ships that go to Norway via the Skagerrak Strait, but in any case, the enemy cannot do what they want. Our ships escorted by airplanes and warships have never been attacked by enemy aircraft in Norwegian waters, which is clear evidence. In addition, the Norwegian port of Namsos has been completely destroyed by German aircraft. Our aircraft have attacked the German-occupied airfields of Stenkjer and Bergen 12 times, dropping incendiary bombs and using machine guns to strafe enemy aircraft. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>British and French Military Authorities Decide to Increase Troops</p>
<p>The Hague – According to reliable sources here, the highest British-French Joint Defense Conference recently held in London, when discussing the situation in Norway, decided that British and French troops will take one of the following two routes in Norway: (1) British and French troops completely withdraw, at least withdraw from southern Norway; (2) Increase the number of British and French troops in Norway to gain superiority in the war situation. As a result, it was decided to take the second route, regardless of all dangers, and step up the British and French naval and air forces in Norway.</p>

So he hurriedly took a small boat to board the plane, and bombs fell all around. However, the captain finally drove the giant seaplane into the air and shot down a Mauser Schmitt-style German aircraft. Now the wreckage of the German aircraft has been found on land. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London – According to reliable sources, since May 8, a total of 28 German transport and supply ships have been sunk, and another ten have been hit by torpedoes launched by British submarines, and are likely submerged. In addition, several German troop transport ships have sunk due to German mines and British mines in Norwegian waters. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – The Helsinki branch of the Norwegian Telegraph Agency recently published a situation in which German aircraft attacked Molde. It is said that German aircraft bombed the central area of the city, causing great material damage. It is not yet known whether there were any casualties. One German aircraft was hit, caught fire and crashed to the ground. Two crew members were burned to death, and one was captured. Several German aircraft were also shot down near Ålesund.

<p>Berlin - German well-informed sources, when interviewed today by the Havas News Agency correspondent, issued comments regarding the British and French refutation of the German White Paper and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech. There are six main points: (1) Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is responsible for pointing out that the German government learned from extremely reliable sources that the occupation of Scandinavia did not proceed because Norway and Sweden did not express consent, but because Finland did not make a formal request. (2) The British troops prepared to land in Norway could not act immediately after the German troops landed because the planned operational plan was completely overturned. The German occupation of Norway was completely unexpected by the British General Staff. According to documents seized from captured British officers, it proves that the ports originally designated for landing by the British were all occupied by German forces, which left the British Navy feeling helpless. (3) The German Foreign Minister explained that the reason why German marines gathered near the Norwegian coast before the British laid mines was that the German side had already received reports that French Premier Reynaud, when meeting with foreign reporters on March 30, declared that Britain and France would make a decisive decision on the situation in Northern Europe in the near future. With this warning from France, it was natural for Germany to mobilize troops. (4) British officials deny that British forces had plans to land in Norway, but this is based on instructions from the Admiralty to the British Consul in Narvik. The evidence is solid and cannot be fabricated by Germany. (5) British officials deny that Britain and France intend to expand the battlefield, but this is a well-known fact. Is not the fact that Britain and France were unwilling to reconcile the Soviet-Finnish conflict evidence of hoping to expand the battlefield? (6) The reason why Ribbentrop's speech did not mention Denmark is because Germany and Denmark have reached a satisfactory agreement. The British War Office denies that German forces captured the headquarters of the British 148th Brigade, but in fact, what was captured were the headquarters of two major units. (Havas, 30th)</p>

<p>London - The Admiralty will adopt a new approach regarding the announcement of ship losses to prevent the enemy from obtaining seemingly favorable information. Subsequently, the total number and tonnage of ships lost will be announced every Sunday, and all will be delayed. It is said that the British Navy has inflicted heavy losses on enemy ships in recent battles, but because Norwegian territorial waters are mined, details beyond the number of ships sunk cannot be obtained. However, Britain readily announces the names of ships sunk by enemy action against Allied countries, which may be what the enemy wants to know, so it is necessary to change the method. The Admiralty also firmly stated that this move is not intended to hide losses but purely to prevent favorable information from reaching the enemy. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>Moscow - People's Commissar for Defence, Marshal Voroshilov, took the opportunity of tomorrow's Labor Day to issue a letter to the soldiers, praising the victories of the Red Army in previous foreign operations, and said that the policies promoted by the Communist Party are both far-sighted and extremely wise. The fact that our country has not been involved in the Western European war is indeed due to this. As for our country's foreign policy, People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov explained it in the Supreme Soviet a few days ago and was unanimously approved by the Supreme Soviet. From now on, this should be the goal. However, Bolsheviks do not have the habit of sticking to old ways, so we must constantly strengthen the Red Army. The various shortcomings we discovered during the last operation against Finland must be corrected by referring to past lessons.

<p>Changchun - Reports from Suifenhe on the Soviet-Manchurian border state that the Soviet army is currently conducting an unprecedentedly large-scale military exercise in the area. It is reported that there was a large fire outside the border in the area that lasted for thirteen hours, and Soviet barracks were destroyed. The "Manchurian" army is on high alert and has set up machine guns. Since the Harbin Soviet-Japanese conference concluded, the "Manchurian" side has adopted a cautious attitude. It is now believed that a large number of military supplies are being transported to the north to prevent further unexpected events. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<p>London - The London branch of the American Chamber of Commerce hosted a banquet for British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross at noon today. During the banquet, Minister Cross gave a speech in which he said, "Our country has implemented economic pressure on Germany, making it feel the pain, but there is also a major loophole, namely the Soviet port of Vladivostok. Since the outbreak of the current European war, a large amount of copper, tin, rubber, and other military supplies have been imported into Vladivostok. It has now been proven that most of them are transshipped from the Soviet Union to Germany, and many other goods have arrived in Vladivostok under the same suspicious circumstances, especially American goods. As for how many American military supplies have arrived in Germany, it is still difficult to determine." (Havas, 30th)</p>

<p>London - Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that Soviet Ambassador Maisky visited Foreign Secretary Halifax last night and delivered a written reply from the Soviet government to the British memorandum of April 19 regarding the resumption of British-Soviet commercial talks. The reply stated that goods imported by the Soviet Union from Britain under the trade agreement will be used exclusively for domestic sales, but the Soviet Union has the right to transport its domestic products to any country that has commercial relations with the Soviet Union, and it is not appropriate to discuss this issue with Britain. It is reported that various sectors in Britain regard the reply as unsatisfactory because of this. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>London - The Soviet Union's reply on the issue of reopening commercial negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union has been commented on by political figures here, who say the content is disappointing. The British government originally hoped that the Soviet government would allow free competition in the country's market, so that Britain could purchase as much Soviet goods as possible, thereby reducing the amount sold to Germany. If the Soviet Union refuses to inform Britain of the figures for the German-Soviet trade agreement, then Britain's above-mentioned goal will not be achieved. Therefore, the current question is whether the Soviet Union is willing to facilitate Britain's purchasing policy. Otherwise, there is nothing to talk about regarding Britain purchasing goods from the Soviet Union. In short, the British government must carefully study the Soviet reply and demand that the Soviet Union give a concrete reply on several issues before reopening commercial negotiations.

<p>London - The Liberal Party's News Chronicle recently published a telegram from a correspondent stationed in Istanbul, Turkey, stating that Turkey is planning two major groups in Southeast Europe and the Near East to resist aggression. The first group is to be formed by the conclusion of a military alliance treaty by the Near Eastern Muslim countries. The scope of the second group is even larger and will be united by Turkey, Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Hungary in the form of a military alliance. When the second group is completed, it will have a population of 80 million. It is reported that the arguments Turkey holds towards the other five countries are roughly as follows: if any country in Southeast Europe is invaded, it will not be able to resist it alone. On the contrary, if an alliance is concluded, the other five countries will certainly come to help. Even if defeated, they can still retreat into the territory of the allied countries and be welcomed by the allied countries, and help them establish a second, third, or even fourth front. Moreover, after the six countries of Southeast Europe conclude an alliance treaty, with eighty million people united, and with the support of Britain and France, its benefits are very obvious.

<p>Rome - Renowned Italian journalist Gayda published an article in the "Berlin Rome Monthly" today, refuting the British and French claims that Italy is not well-prepared for war, and strongly argued that the Italian Navy is not only strong in tonnage, but also has new-style armaments. If ordered to take action, it can not only guarantee the security of the Mediterranean against any strongest enemy, but also be sent to other places for activities. Secondly, the air force has had considerable development based on Mussolini's policy of being prepared for anything. Expenditures for aviation have reached 3,250,000,000 lire, and aircraft production has reached its maximum limit. Thirdly, the Italian Army has a total of eighteen army corps, including ninety-four infantry divisions, one army corps of armored troops with three divisions, one army corps of mechanized troops with two divisions, one army corps of rapid deployment troops with three divisions, and five divisions of Alpine troops. Today, compared with 1935, the Italian Army has increased by three army corps, twenty divisions, and twenty artillery regiments. In addition, the defenses of Italian East Africa and the islands in the Aegean Sea are very strong, which shows that Italy's non-participation in the war is not due to insufficient preparation, but to maintain freedom of action in the future.

<p>Rome - The Italian newspapers' criticism of Britain and France has become increasingly clear recently, and the methods are constantly emerging, with no two being alike.

The newspapers have all traced back to the battle between French and Italian troops in Janiculum in 1849, and said that France has been hostile to Italy since then. The Giornale d'Italia also cited examples to illustrate this, saying that France's occupation of Tunisia is one, its consistent disregard for Italy's actions in Libya and Abyssinia is two, and France's repeated and firm refusal of Italy's recent legitimate demands is three. All of these are manifestations of the traditional spirit of France. (Havas, 30th)</p>

<h3 id="e54">U.S. Naval Officers Study Pacific Defense: Vincent's Naval Expansion Plan Deeply Concerns Japan <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Washington – U.S. naval officers yesterday studied reports of setbacks encountered by the British Navy off the Norwegian coast. According to well-informed naval sources, the U.S. Navy will focus on small torpedo boats and small vessels suitable for the rugged coastlines of Alaska, Hawaii, the Philippines, and other Pacific islands. Meanwhile, Democratic Senator Reno reintroduced the request to acquire Wrangel Island north of Alaska. Democratic Senator Hugh Wellesley claimed he would demand fortifications be built at the Dutch port of Anchorage, Alaska, and at Fair-banks, to prepare for enemies invading Alaska via the Bering Sea and the Arctic Ocean. Increased attention is being paid here to the construction of a defensive highway from the western coast of the United States through Canada to Alaska. (30th Associated Press) "Contemporary Japan" Contem Poray Janan</p>
<p>The Japanese government and public are extraordinarily concerned about the discussion in the U.S. Congress regarding the third naval expansion plan proposed by Congressman Vincent. There are two reasons for this: first, the U.S. attitude towards Japan has become increasingly tough in recent months, and second, the scope of U.S. naval activities may extend to the waters near Japan. The first reason is beyond the scope of this article, but the termination of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty of 1911 cannot be ignored. The U.S.'s unwillingness to renew the treaty has particularly impressed the Japanese, who believe that the U.S. holds a truly negative attitude towards Japan's policy towards China. Some people therefore question whether a U.S.-Japan conflict can be avoided. The U.S. clearly refuses to cooperate with Japan's policy of expansion on the Asian continent and intends to pressure Japan to change this policy. In any case, the current situation is indeed fraught with danger.</p>
<p>The author does not point out any reasons to criticize the U.S. naval expansion plan. Three years ago, when Britain decided to expand its naval five-year plan, the author wrote an article explaining that Britain's plan would stimulate U.S. naval expansion. The impact of U.S. naval expansion will spread across the Pacific Ocean and affect Japan. The direction of U.S. naval policy is to maintain the balance of the world's largest naval power. Therefore, Britain's five-year plan will naturally prompt the United States to build more warships, which in turn will force Japan to expand its navy to cope with the massive U.S. fleet.</p>
<p>Vincent's first naval shipbuilding plan was passed by the U.S. Congress in the spring of 1934, stipulating the construction of six battleships, ninety-six auxiliary ships of various classes, totaling two hundred and two ships, with a total tonnage of 430,000 tons. The main purpose was for the United States to build a fleet of average strength, which cannot be considered a sign of a major naval policy, because until the passage of the bill, although the U.S. Navy had the most powerful battleships and first-class cruisers, second-class cruisers, destroyers, and submarines were relatively weak and insufficient to maintain strategic proportions for battleships. In addition, what Vincent's "plan" stipulated was the fleet deemed necessary by various naval powers.</p>
<p>At that time, the United States had fifteen battleships older than the Oklahoma, designed in 1911. The ten light cruisers were indeed too few. As for the 223 destroyers owned by the United States, most were completed during the emergency period from 1918 to 1919 and were already outdated. Only about fifty ships could be deployed as first-line warships. Of the ninety-one U.S. submarines, about twenty were new. Therefore, Vincent's first plan aimed to replace these old warships with new ones and build new auxiliary ships to meet strategic needs, which was a matter of course. Moreover, when this plan was passed, the 1930 London Naval Treaty was still in effect. The United States built ninety-six auxiliary ships within the limits of the treaty, which can be said to be merely fulfilling its treaty rights, so it cannot be said to be a provocative act of naval competition. However, the United States, based on the treaty, built the latest type of warships with great mobility and formed a fleet based at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands, which could easily expand its offensive to the waters near the Japanese mainland.</p>
<p>The warships built by the United States in accordance with Vincent's first plan are extraordinarily satisfactory. The heavy cruiser Salt Lake City, built in 1929, is completely different from the later Pensacola, and these two ships clearly seek to achieve the expected perfection. However, the first warship built according to Vincent's plan in 1938, the cruiser Brooklyn, equipped with six-inch caliber guns, is truly astonishing. It is not excessive to equip this 10,000-ton cruiser with fifteen six-inch guns. A speed of thirty-three knots per hour is also not uncommon. However, the armor plate of the Brooklyn is more than twice as thick as that of any heavy cruiser in the world, thus remedying the greatest weakness of this type of warship. The Brooklyn's range is over 12,000 miles, setting a new record for the range of all surface ships.</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the weakest part of the U.S. fleet is the destroyer fleet. However, according to Vincent's plan, this point has also been significantly improved. For example, the first destroyer Craven built according to Vincent's plan has a displacement of 1,500 tons, but its combat power is equal to that of any first-class destroyer in the world. The ship is equipped with four five-inch guns and sixteen 21-inch torpedo tubes. As for the speed of thirty-seven knots per hour, it is not extraordinary, but the ship has a greater range than any British or Japanese destroyer. This can be clearly demonstrated by the fact that the ship carries 400 tons of heavy oil and can cruise for 6,000 miles without relying on supply ships for replenishment. The Sum-mers-class destroyers built at the same time as the Craven class have a displacement of 1,800 tons, are equipped with eight five-inch guns, and have a range of about 7,000 miles. In addition, the Porpoise-class submarine has a displacement of only 1,250 tons, but can make a long voyage of 15,000 miles.</p>
<p>The three types of warships discussed above—cruisers, destroyers, and submarines—share a common characteristic: exceptionally sharp armament and great range. These warships inevitably have a weakness due to their extraordinary range. It goes without saying that increasing the range of a warship will necessarily reduce its armament. Because increasing the range not only requires greater capacity and weight to carry fuel and food, but also requires special facilities to accommodate the officers and men. The tonnage originally allocated to armament must be reduced. Although the exact amount cannot be determined, if the range of the Craven-class destroyer is reduced from 6,000 miles to 3,000 miles, one five-inch gun could be added.</p>
<p>The difference between Japanese warships and U.S. warships lies in reducing the range and strengthening the armament. If the U.S. Navy's organization and equipment are not intended for transoceanic operations, the U.S. Navy should maintain an advantage over Japan. For the sake of future U.S.-Japan relations and general world peace, the navies of both the United States and Japan must strictly maintain a defensive posture. (Translated Contemporay Japan)</p>

It is said that the Immigration Act seems to have caused unrest in Japan, but the United States has had nothing to do with the case from the beginning. The case was drafted by the Philippine government a year ago. Some people speculate that the bill aims to prevent the continuous entry of Jews, but the Philippine government treats Chinese, Japanese, and people of other countries equally and does not discriminate, so there is no question of excluding Jews. Regarding the issue of Philippine independence, if it is not subject to unforeseeable obstacles, the move towards independence should be realized in 1946. (30th Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e58">Japan Begins Fortifications on Mandated Islands: Report Seemingly Credible and Worthy of Study <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Washington – It is now generally believed here that Japan has begun building defensive works on several islands in the Pacific Ocean mandated by the League of Nations. The draft of the 1938 report on Japan's mandated situation has now been delivered to Washington. The book makes no mention of fortifications, which is very different from the 1937 report, in which Qi Zhong clearly stated that Japan had not established fortifications on the islands. Since the 1938 book does not contain this guarantee, many people here believe that the widespread rumors that Japan is building defensive works on several islands are true, although they cannot be confirmed. However, there must be a reason for this. Japan's mandated islands total 623, all of which belonged to Germany before the last European war. Among them are the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands, and the Marshall Islands. The U.S. outpost of Guam is located in the center of Japan's mandated territory. Some of the islands are only about 400 miles from the Philippines. The United States has previously firmly refused to allocate funds to improve the port of Guam, lest Japan have an excuse. The existing treaties between Japan and the Western powers, including the United States, do not allow Japan to build defensive works on its mandated islands. The report mentions that in 1938, only twelve foreigners arrived on the islands, including one Filipino and one Australian, two Dutchmen, two Russians, and two Frenchmen, and four Dutch East Indians. The number of Japanese residents on the islands has exceeded that of the indigenous people. In 1938, there were a total of 121,128 residents, of whom 70,141 were Japanese and 119 were foreigners, mostly clergy. The largest number of foreigners were Spaniards, followed by Chinese, and then Germans. Currently, residents of the islands speak Japanese in conversation. The 1938 report also did not mention the trade figures for that year, but only said that "there is a good prospect for development," and mentioned that the trade figures for 1937 were 61,500,000 Japanese yen.

<h3 id="e62">Labor Day Celebrated Today: Shanghai Workers Support Resistance and Reconstruction, Unanimously Intensifying Work and Striving for Production; Municipal Party Committee Encourages Workers to Save the Country From Their Positions <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Today is International Labor Day. The city's workers, as usual, are taking a holiday to celebrate. The Municipal Party Committee and the Kuomintang Zhongzi Comrades Datongmeng and the General Labor Union issued letters to the workers and paid tribute to Chairman Chiang. The authorities in the concessions, due to the heavy revolutionary commemorations during the May holidays, are implementing emergency precautions for one month starting today. Details are described below.</p>
<p>General Labor Union Pays Tribute to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>In celebration of May 1st Labor Day, the Shanghai General Labor Union yesterday sent a special telegram to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek paying tribute, saying: "Respectful Generalissimo Chiang, time flies, and International Labor Day has arrived again. At this time, news of victories is frequently reported, and the whole country is invigorated, indicating that the final victory is coming soon. This union has always supported you and respected national policy. In the future, we will adhere to the spirit of 'May 1st' and vow not to slacken. We send this telegram respectfully wishing you good health. Shanghai General Labor Union."</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Party Committee Encourages the Labor Sector</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, in its letter to the labor compatriots of this city on the occasion of "May 1st," stated: "May 1st originated in 1886 and has a history of 54 years. The labor masses of the entire world, in commemoration of their past struggles, are all happy and inspired to celebrate the victory they won more than half a century ago. Our country's national industry is still in its infancy, with short capital and a fragile foundation. Therefore, the number of laborers in the industrial sector accounts for a small proportion of the total employed population in the country. Therefore, the Japanese, in view of the gradual rise of our country's national industry and the rapid progress of economic construction, resolutely launched their war of aggression, trapping our cities and destroying our industry. Coupled with the dumping of Japanese goods and rampant smuggling, our national industry in its infancy was either destroyed by the aggressors' claws or struggled under their iron hooves, unable to catch its breath. It is not difficult to imagine the difficult lives of the hundreds of thousands of labor compatriots in this city. You have dedicated yourselves to the war of resistance, and have made laborious contributions. Since the withdrawal of the national army to the west, the environment has become increasingly difficult. Except for a few workers who sell their souls and bodies, all can bury themselves in production and engage in their jobs. Although the situation is difficult, their loyalty is unwavering. This kind of admirable spirit is the cornerstone for the inevitable victory of the war of resistance and the inevitable success of national construction, which is why this department has always admired and respected you. We sincerely hope that our labor compatriots will all maintain their firm will, unite as one, not be intimidated by threats, not be tempted by bribes, intensify their work, strive for production, and contribute to the great cause of resistance and reconstruction. If you commemorate today's 'May 1st' with a long-term war of resistance, and commemorate the future 'May 1st' with final victory, would it not be even more significant?"</p>
<p>General Labor Union's Letter to Workers</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union's letter to the city's workers in commemoration of "May 1st" stated: "Dear workers of the city, the all-nation war of resistance has reached the eve of final victory. We are happy to celebrate the most glorious and precious 'May 1st' International Labor Day in the history of the labor movement. We should not only celebrate and be encouraged, but also emulate its great cause. The facts of 'May 1st' are already deeply recognized and understood by labor workers all over the world. It seems that there is no need to repeat them here. However, the lessons that this history has given us are too profound and are worth writing about. Just imagine that on this day in 1888, the workers of Chicago, USA, could not bear the oppression and exploitation of capitalism and rose up in reasonable resistance. However, its original demand had only one condition: the eight-hour system. It can also be said that it only demanded a reduction in working hours. But such a simple demand required the sacrifice of many lives and the shedding of countless blood to win a glorious victory. In this way, we can further deduce that the success of any matter must be obtained through sacrifice and difficulty. This precious historical fact and our great cause of resistance and reconstruction are truly the most appropriate lessons. The oppression we have suffered from Japanese imperialism is ten thousand times greater than that of capitalism, and what we demand is national independence, freedom, and the integrity of territorial sovereignty, which is also ten thousand times greater than the eight-hour system. The sacred war of resistance has been going on for two years and ten months, and the certainty of victory is as firm as iron. Workers, the lessons of history and the grasp of reality, all have been fully demonstrated. The final victory truly belongs to us. However, this precious victory still needs to be won through hardship. We cannot sit idly by and wait for victory to come. We are in this isolated island filled with human demons and ghosts, and we should strengthen our will, intensify our organization, strictly adhere to our posts, and complete our great cause of resistance and reconstruction."</p>
<p>Expansion of the Honesty and Shame Movement Propaganda</p>
<p>Today is International Labor Day. The Honesty and Shame Movement Committee of the city's labor sector, considering that there are many workers in this city and their educational levels are uneven, is deeply concerned that those with ulterior motives may use the workers to incite them, which will not only harm the workers themselves but also affect society and the country. Therefore, a day of expanded propaganda for the labor sector is being held. The committee has printed a large number of letters to the workers' leaflets, encouraging the workers to recognize the environment, unite labor and capital, develop organizations, participate in the war of resistance and reconstruction, and strive for final victory. It has notified the members of the affiliated Lixing Corps to act together.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities on Alert for One Month</p>
<p>May is the month with the most revolutionary commemorations, such as "May 1st" for World Labor Day, "May 3rd" the Jinan Massacre, "May 4th" Youth Day, "May 5th" the Anniversary of the Premier's Inauguration as the Extraordinary Grand President, "May 9th" the National Humiliation Day of the Twenty-One Demands, and "May 30th" the Shanghai Massacre Day. The police authorities of the two concessions, for fear of bad elements disrupting public order, implement special precautions for one month every year during this month. Because the situation in Shanghai is special, in order to ensure the safety of the area, it has been decided to implement emergency precautions from today until the 31st of this month. All gatherings, associations, parades, and demonstrations that have not been approved are prohibited. At the same time, detectives will be dispatched to be stationed at various public venues and recreational venues to monitor everything. In addition, patrol teams and inspection teams will patrol the roads, and all suspicious pedestrians and vehicles will be searched. In addition, the defense forces stationed in Shanghai by various countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Italy, as well as the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, will also assist the police authorities in maintaining public order at any time.</p>

<p>Interest Rates Slightly Higher, Foreign Exchange Market Remains the Same</p>
<p>Yesterday was the only final settlement date for the long-term loans at the end of April in the 29th year of the Republic. All deposits and loans were finalized in the market yesterday. Most of the transactions were old accounts transferred, and there were few new loans. It is estimated that national goods factories accounted for about 10 million yuan, silk shops, sugar and northern goods shops, grocery stores, etc. accounted for about 7.8 million yuan, and old customers accounted for about 4.5 million yuan, totaling about 20 million yuan. The interest rate was slightly higher than before. As for the financial market, it remained as stable as ever. The market foreign exchange market still opened at 20 cents per tael. All industries safely passed through, and there were no bankruptcies, which was very different from the end of April before the war. However, the various banks and shops extended their office hours according to their business situation, and the exchange of bills and all collections were particularly busy.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Which Ship Will Carry Parcels to Europe Must Be Decided First <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The sender fills it in themselves so that the post office can deliver it</p>
<p>The post office announced that the public must decide which ship to use to transport parcels to various countries in Europe in the future, and clearly fill in the name of the ship on the parcel and the parcel delivery form for processing. Furthermore, the said ship is limited to those carrying parcel mail. The announcement is hereby made to inform the public. The announcement, Director Zha Peilin, Republic of China, April 29, 19.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Legal Tender Brought to Shanghai Must Have a Ministry Permit <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>No matter which party, the same shall apply</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance issued an order restricting the export of legal tender, the Zhejiang Customs became even stricter in checking travelers carrying legal tender. The amount seized and confiscated has reached more than 100,000 yuan. However, if there is a legitimate use, an application can be made to the Ministry of Finance for a passport before it can be carried for export. In the past, various local troops wanted to purchase military supplies in Shanghai and asked the Zhejiang Customs to allow them to carry legal tender for export. The total amount in the past year reached more than 2.4 million yuan. However, from January 1 to the end of April in the 29th year, the amount of legal tender that the Zhejiang Customs released for various troops to apply for export exceeded 4 million yuan. There were even a very small number of unscrupulous soldiers who managed to obtain a paper document to transport it for others or to buy profits for merchants. Therefore, there was a lot of criticism, and the Zhejiang Customs was pointed out. According to reliable sources, after the Chongqing Ministry of Finance learned of the above news, it ordered the Zhejiang Customs to strictly examine those who applied to export legal tender. Only those who were sure of legitimate use could be allowed to export. After receiving the order, the Zhejiang Customs has stated that no matter which party carries legal tender for export, those who have not obtained a passport from the Ministry of Finance will not be allowed to export.</p>

<p>In addition to merging the Japan Mail Steamship Company, Nissin, Osaka, etc. into the East Asia Shipping Company to monopolize the coastal shipping lines of China, the Japanese are also plotting to seize the Yangtze River shipping industry. The company and the former "Renovation Government" jointly invested 30 million Japanese yen to establish the "China Shipping Company" to facilitate the future control of the Yangtze River. The inaugural meeting was held on February 25 this year at the Japanese Club on Jiaojianshi Road in Hongkou. The lower floor on the left side of the French Postboat Company Building on the Bund in the French Concession is now being rented as an office. The interior is being painted and will start operations on the 15th of this month. However, there is no sign of the ships yet. The company is jointly run by the "East Asia Shipping Company," the "Central China Revitalization Company," and the Nanjing puppet organization. However, all the power is in the hands of the Japanese, and the puppet side is only a nominal one. According to well-informed sources, after the "company" is established, it will exert strong control over the Yangtze River shipping industry. The result will be that although the Yangtze River is open, third-country shipping will not be able to compete with it.</p>

<h3 id="e67">More Than 5,000 Villages in Western Shanghai Are Devastated, the Surrounding Area Spans Over a Hundred Li, and 50,000 Households Are Affected <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>For more than half a month, the villages and towns in the Shang, Jia, Qing, and Song counties in western Shanghai have suffered repeated massacres and atrocities by Japanese and puppet troops. The general situation has been reported in various newspapers, shocking society. The horror of the situation, which is unprecedented, is heartbreaking to hear. The western Shanghai area is a rice-producing region. Due to this devastation, no one is cultivating the land, which will have a significant impact on the future rice shortage. The truth about the devastation is of great concern to society. Mr. Song from Shipinong Village in the northern countryside of Zhudi Town returned to Shanghai today and spoke of his personal experiences, which are a vivid depiction of the tragedy, causing pain and indignation. The following is a transcript:</p>
<p>Fearing Accidents, Dared Not Go East</p>
<p>I am a merchant in Shanghai. During the Spring Festival and Qingming Festival, I returned to my hometown to sweep the tombs. Unexpectedly, I was caught in the crossfire and nearly lost my life. Although I have escaped from the tiger's mouth, recalling the situation at that time, I still feel frightened. Now I will make public the truth of the massacre to show the true face of the Japanese, who constantly talk about "building a new order in East Asia," "good neighborliness and friendship," and "Sino-Japanese cooperation." I stayed in my hometown for three days and finished my business. I was preparing to return to Shanghai when I suddenly heard that the three traitors of the puppet Peaceful National Construction Army, Xu Leisheng, Zhao Jiayou, and Tian Weiyong, led their troops and came with the Japanese army to suppress the guerrilla forces of Gu Fusheng. I also heard that the villages near Zhudi Town had been greatly devastated. Fearing accidents, I dared not go east, because Zhudi Town was the only way for me to go back and forth.</p>
<p>Old, Weak, Women, and Children: Insulted and Shot</p>
<p>The next day, the situation became very urgent and was about to affect our village. So the whole family fled west. Fortunately, we left half an hour earlier and escaped the catastrophe. Looking at the eastern village from a few miles away, we saw flames reaching the sky and faint cries could be heard. So we fled as hard as we could and stayed temporarily with relatives more than ten miles away. Unexpectedly, at dawn, the Japanese and puppet troops chased after us. We heard gunshots nearby. Before we could wash, we fled wildly north. Soon, the Japanese and puppet troops had stormed into the village. Helpless, we hid in the deep trenches of the wheat fields to avoid them. After the Japanese and puppet troops entered the village, they saw only the old, weak, women, and children left behind, so they gathered them together and questioned them separately about whether there were any guerrillas hiding. As a result, the answers were not satisfactory, so they were angry and insulted them one by one before brutally killing or shooting them.</p>
<p>Searching the Wheat Fields: Slaughtered Completely</p>
<p>All the villagers who had not been able to escape far and were hiding in the wheat fields could have been spared. However, the wicked puppet soldier Zhao Jiayou flattered the Japanese army, saying that the guerrillas might not have gone far and must be hiding in the nearby wheat fields. This remark led to an unprecedented disaster. The Japanese army believed Zhao's words. Whenever they went to a village and saw no one, they searched the nearby wheat fields, slaughtering everyone, regardless of age or gender. After the Japanese army left, the puppet soldiers bundled up all the food, livestock, clothing, and belongings left behind in the homes of the villagers and took them away on civilian boats.</p>
<p>Corpses Everywhere: Foul Odor Lingering</p>
<p>At that time, my whole family was fortunate to have hidden in a relatively remote place and was not found, which was very lucky. We heard that the Japanese and puppet troops had gone far away, so we fled in a hurry to the home of relatives in Huangdu Town to take refuge for a few days. On the 22nd, we learned that the puppet Peaceful National Construction Army had posted public notices in Zhudi, Panlong, and announcing the cessation of the massacre. So on the 24th, we dared to return home to visit relatives. Along the way, corpses were everywhere, and the stench was suffocating. Some family members were searching for bodies and crying, while others dared not collect the bodies and left them exposed. It was truly a human tragedy that I could not bear to witness. Looking back at my home, it was also desolate, with only dilapidated walls left.</p>
<p>More Than 5,000 Villages: More Than 50,000 Households</p>
<p>The disaster area was very wide, stretching from Zhudi and Panlong in the east to Baihegang in the old Qingpu in the west, and from Chenfangqiao and Qibao in the south to Jiwangmiao and Huangdu in the north, covering an area of more than a hundred li. There were more than 5,000 villages, and with an average of ten households per village, more than 50,000 households were affected. The area near Guanyintang suffered the most damage. The villages were burned to scorched earth, and there were almost no people within ten li. In the entire outline of western Shanghai, hundreds of villages were destroyed, and more than 1,000 innocent villagers were killed. The injured were countless. The number of those who died from their injuries could not be counted. The number of people who were homeless must be enormous, which is unbearable to hear. I sincerely hope that people in Shanghai will provide concrete relief to protect the survivors.</p>
<p>Xu and Zhao Did Evil: The Villagers Gnashed Their Teeth</p>
<p>Now, the Japanese and puppet troops are still rampant. In the past two days, a large number of them have come again, and they have not stopped the killing despite the public notice of peace. It seems that there will be no survivors left. This tragedy was caused by the two traitors, Xu and Zhao. Before the incident, Zhao made a living by petty theft, and Xu was a vagrant who roamed the western Shanghai area. Now, one is acting as a lackey, insidious and vicious, even surpassing the Japanese army. Both traitors are now wealthy, with many wives and concubines, and their behavior is extravagant. All of this is nothing more than extracting the fat from the people. Therefore, the people of western Shanghai all hate them to the bone and hope that they will be brought to justice as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Western Reporters: On-the-Spot Investigation</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that last Wednesday, the Japanese army burned 300 farmhouses and massacred about 500 farmers beside the Qinghu Highway, less than fifteen miles west of Shanghai. This was discovered by reporters who recently visited the area. The reporter, accompanied by two British journalists, took a car to the suburbs of Shanghai for a spring outing on the green Qinghu Highway. Unexpectedly, they saw that the farmhouses in the area had been devastated by the Japanese army and reduced to ruins, with wounds everywhere. Farmers were picking up the remnants in the gravel.</p>
<p>Collecting the Remnants</p>
<p>They went forward to investigate. A villager in tattered clothes told the reporter that the area was located halfway between Shanghai and Qingpu. Last Wednesday, the Japanese army suddenly surrounded the area from the north, south, and west to search for guerrillas. The farmers suffered a catastrophe. Many died under the guns and bayonets of the Japanese army, including many women, children, and the elderly. Several were injured and needed medical treatment, but they could not come to Shanghai because they did not have passes. The reporters saw a total of twelve burned villages along the way. However, the villagers said that there were dozens more villages that had also been burned. The most concrete evidence seen by the reporters was seven new coffins by the river. According to a villager, the twelve villages were set on fire and burned during the day, because after dusk, the Japanese army did not dare to venture into areas where they suspected guerrillas were present. When the thatched houses caught fire, the farmers fled in panic and were stabbed by the Japanese army. It was said that in the first villages to be devastated, four old men were stabbed to death. The reporters visited the tragic scene after the devastation one by one.</p>
<p>The Tragic Scene After the Devastation</p>
<p>They saw that a large amount of white rice stored in the farmhouses had also been burned and scattered all over the ground. The farmers' hard work for a year had been in vain. The seven coffins by the river contained the remains of a farmer's family who had died in the disaster. The corpses had rotted, and the stench was overwhelming. People covered their noses and passed by. The reporters then went to a farmhouse that had escaped the fire for a short rest. The owner offered tea to entertain them. Women and children from nearby villages gathered around upon hearing the news. One eight-year-old girl had an apparent injury to her left arm. When asked, it turned out that she had been injured by a Japanese soldier. The reporter also saw a bloodstain on the girl's shoulder.</p>
<p>Stains of Blood</p>
<p>When asked about the reason, the homeowner gestured with both hands, not knowing what to call the bayonet. The reporter took out a small knife, and the injured girl screamed in fright. The homeowner nodded in agreement and asked if there was any medicine to treat the worsening wound. The reporter told them that they needed to go to Shanghai to buy it, but the homeowner shook his head, saying that they could not get a pass to go to Shanghai. After a while, the reporters said goodbye and returned north to the Qinghu Highway two miles away. Guided by a young farmer, they saw several more burned villages along the way, the situation was extremely tragic.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Detailed Account of Transportation from Eastern Zhejiang to the Interior, Reaching Hengyang Directly from Ningbo, Jinhua, and Yingtan, Highways and Trains Are Seamlessly Connected <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>(Special Report from This Newspaper) The route from Ningbo to the interior via Jinhua was once disrupted at the beginning of the war in eastern Zhejiang. However, due to the stabilization of the war situation, various transportation lines gradually returned to normal. Since the end of February, it has returned to its original state. However, the train and bus times and fares along the route have changed greatly. Here is an exploration of the latest situation:</p>

<h3 id="e69">Norwegian Ships Resume Normal Navigation, American Liners Gather in the Huangpu River, American Far East Shipping Is Reviving, and Shanghai's Commerce Relies on It to Not Decline <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Norwegian Legation in this city recently announced that Norwegian ships have now resumed normal navigation before the outbreak of the war between Germany and Norway, as are the Norwegian ships along the coast of China. Norwegian ships on the Far East seas are following the instructions of the Norwegian Shipping Committee in London and have resumed navigation without hindrance.</p>

<p>A real man! A great man! These titles already reveal glory in their meaning, not to mention that we ourselves are the ones bearing them! Therefore, a man from adulthood to marriage should use his abundant energy to diligently irrigate and cultivate the love between husband and wife, so that their flower of love blossoms exceptionally brilliantly and beautifully. At the same time, encouraged by love, they should strive to move forward towards a bright future. How happy and meaningful is such a life! As a Western proverb says: "A happy life must be encouraged by love and led by knowledge." These are truly wise words!</p>
<p>Indeed, a married man bears great responsibilities in both love and career. Being able to take responsibility is glory. This is a motto that a newlywed husband should keep in mind. But I know that there are many married men who shirk their responsibilities as husbands, or even push the responsibility onto their wives. The husband suffers from sperm deficiency and infertility, and after years of marriage, he is infertile, saying that it is the wife's infertility and wanting to take a concubine. But even after taking a concubine, he is still infertile, but his concubine has already had children with someone else. There are also husbands who, due to masturbation and indulgence in their early years, have damaged the endocrine fluid in their reproductive glands, resulting in loose sperm gates and weakened nerves in the brain, sex organs, and spinal cord. As a result, symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, sperm deficiency and infertility, brain decay and forgetfulness, and premature aging occur. After marriage, they often cannot satisfy their wives' demands in married life, or even completely fail their wives, causing their wives' hearts to be lonely and resentful. Is this a good phenomenon in the family? A smart husband can quickly seek ways to strengthen himself and take the responsibilities he should have. It is not too late. The most foolish and shameful thing is to remain ignorant and unrepentant. Not only will his own body become incurable, but his wife will also inevitably become angry and resentful, or display thunderous power; or, due to the hunger and thirst for love, commit adultery and elope with someone else; or even file a divorce lawsuit against her husband with good reason. Life at this time and in this situation is not very sad! Then, what is the way for husbands with insufficient energy to strengthen themselves? According to the experience of world-renowned doctors and my own, actively taking the reproductive gland preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" is the most effective treatment for this condition. Because this agent is based on the most advanced principle of replenishment therapy in medicine, it extracts the endocrine essence of reproductive glands from healthy animals such as apes, orangutans, tigers, wolves, deer, and sea dogs, and uses the latest scientific methods to concentrate and replicate it into an agent. Therefore, the quality of this agent is precious and its efficacy is certain, which is unmatched by any similar preparation. Men can produce sperm, nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain, and promote blood circulation within one day and night after taking it. What is even more valuable is continuous use, which will further promote development, nourish nerves, thicken sperm and blood, and cure various symptoms in the short term, doubling energy. Middle-aged and elderly people can take it regularly to prolong life, rejuvenate, and return to youth. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take the special medicine for treating nocturnal emission "Xi Mi Tuo Shi Gu Jing Pian" (sold in major pharmacies such as Zhongxi Wuzhou and the Western Medicine Department of Wing On Company, the actual price is 2 yuan per box) to consolidate the sperm gates and prevent leakage, so that the effect is even more rapid. When I was studying special treatments for venereal diseases in the United States, I and Dr. Osman and Professor Weir Walter and others repeatedly conducted clinical trials of this agent, and all had satisfactory results. After returning to China, I have used this agent to cure no less than tens of thousands of patients, so I specially recommend it responsibly.</p>
<p>Fitness and Beauty</p>
<h3 id="e74">Is Your Breast Development Good? <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Spring is gone and cannot be returned!</p>
<p>Losing fitness and beauty is even more tragic!</p>
<p>Quickly seek famous medicines to make up for it,</p>
<p>It is also great to cleverly steal from heaven.</p>
<p>Spring, of course, is beautiful and lovely, but it comes and goes quickly. Although it feels beautiful and lovely, it cannot be retained, only giving people sadness and regret!</p>
<p>Girls are also beautiful and lovely, but many girls with withered breasts and lost fitness, although in their prime years, already resemble the fading autumn light, not worth cherishing at all. If youth disappears and beauty fades, it will be even more disgusting and hateful! Moreover, "spring" can eventually return. Beautiful and fragrant flowers wither this year, but can bloom again next year. Only humans, known as the spirit of all things, cannot regain their lost youth. It is like a person with flaws. If they do not find ways to make up for them, then the flaws will become more and more deficient. To put it plainly, for example, if a woman with withered breasts, thin hips, haggard face, and withered muscles is not rescued in time with the most appropriate special medicine, then as age increases, she will only become older and uglier. She will never be able to freely restore her inherent beauty due to the increase in age.</p>
<p>Then, what is the most appropriate and effective special medicine to remedy such defects today? According to the unanimous introduction of famous Chinese and Western doctors and thousands of users, the ovarian endocrine preparation "Female Sheng Zhi Su" should be considered the best of its kind. Although there are many gynecological medicines on the market today, their ingredients, efficacy, and preparation are not as fast as "Female Sheng Zhi Su." The most unique and amazing thing about this agent that people believe in is that it has the most obvious effect on the development of the breast. Once taken, in addition to regulating menstruation, stopping leucorrhea, dispelling disease, and strengthening the body, it can make the withered breasts stand up in a short period of time. If they are usually loose and sagging and not in a beautiful state, they will become fuller and firmer after taking it, forming a healthy and beautiful breast full of elasticity. Artificial cleverness steals from heaven, and "Female Sheng Zhi Su" is enough to be proud of.</p>
<h3 id="e75">The Relationship Between Nocturnal Emission and Summer Heat Syndrome <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>There is a type of weak youth who, every summer, experience what is called summer heat syndrome. In fact, summer heat syndrome is not an isolated disease; it is mostly due to neurasthenia, anemia, and kidney deficiency. This condition feels very mild, or not felt at all, when the weather is good. However, when the weather becomes hot in summer, the symptoms become very obvious. Ordinary people, not understanding the cause, simply call it "summer heat syndrome."</p>
<p>The body of a young person is like a sapling in spring, which should be strong and robust. Why then does the nervous system become weak, and the blood become stagnant? According to medical diagnosis, this is mostly due to having committed the bad habit of self-pollution, or due to excessive indulgence, or prolonged nocturnal emission. Therefore, the endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands, the source of life, gradually becomes exhausted! The endocrine fluid of the reproductive glands nourishes the nerves, regulates metabolism, and promotes developmental functions. If it gradually becomes exhausted, the nerves will gradually weaken. Therefore, patients with nocturnal emission will inevitably have symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, and palpitations, which are all symbols of neurasthenia. Symptoms such as dizziness, blurred vision, astigmatism, and nearsightedness are symbols of optic nerve weakness. Symptoms such as poor digestion and loss of appetite are symbols of gastric nerve weakness. If the sexual nerves are weak, then symptoms such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and dissipated energy abound. At the same time, if the metabolism in the skin, blood, muscles, and other parts is reduced, only old cells die, and no new cells are generated. Naturally, symptoms such as a sallow complexion, thinness, anemia, premature aging, and incomplete development will successively arise. Such a young person, when summer arrives, can they avoid summer heat syndrome? I am afraid that summer heat syndrome is only a minor ailment. Their future prospects are truly unimaginable! To seek remedy and prevention, the only way is to quickly cure the nocturnal emission. If the special medicine "Hemitol Semen-Consolidating Tablets" is taken at this time, it will surely consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves. After taking it, it will have the miraculous effect of inducing sleep and stopping nocturnal emission on the same night. Those who already have the above symptoms must also take the strengthening animal reproductive gland preparation "Reproductin" to supplement the brain, kidneys, essence, blood, and nerves. This will surely cure all symptoms, improve health, and prevent summer heat syndrome permanently in a short period of time. If patients can come to our clinic for diagnosis and treatment in person, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3 id="e76">Unintentionally Developing Chronic Gonorrhea <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Dai De, Gonorrhea Specialist</p>
<p>Clinic: Corner of Beijing Road and Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Consultation hours: 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM</p>
<p>Only 40 cents registration fee during extraordinary times</p>
<p>In the initial acute symptoms, it often turns into chronic gonorrhea without realizing it. Based on my years of experience, in addition to gonorrhea bacteria, other bacteria are often mixed in, especially bacilli. Patients feel discomfort and itching in the urethra, or slight pain, and then seek medical treatment. However, due to the mild symptoms, patients often neglect treatment and health maintenance.</p>
<p>Therefore, unknowingly, the gonorrhea bacteria invade the posterior urethra from the anterior urethra, causing prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, orchitis, cystitis, and systemic infectious arthritis, and only then do they realize that their disease has not only not healed, but has worsened.</p>
<p>Sometimes, in these cases, the urine is not completely turbid, but mostly transparent, or slightly tinted with a small amount of gonorrheal discharge. However, in reality, these situations often unintentionally transmit the disease to the opposite sex. Therefore, husbands who already have wives should pay special attention to the symptoms of chronic gonorrhea and seek immediate treatment. Whenever such symptoms are encountered, urine culture must be used for repeated examinations, or prostate massage should be performed, and the fluid extracted should be examined under a microscope. Gonorrhea bacteria and other bacilli will surely be found to determine the location of the gonorrhea, and then treatment can be given according to the symptoms. The most effective treatment method is the German Filtral Current Therapy, in which a conductor is inserted into the urethra, and then the electrical intensity is adjusted according to the severity of the condition, so that the bactericidal power directly penetrates the lesion, just right. German Hee's Serum is also used to resist gonorrhea, kill bacteria, and build immunity. Other methods, such as irrigation, massage, cooling, and hot baths, can be applied according to the symptoms. Chronic gonorrhea in such cases can be cured in four to five weeks.</p>

<p>The French Municipal Council Price Equalization Committee is conducting a detailed investigation into the causes of rising prices of various daily necessities in this city in order to suppress price increases. Regarding the various main causes of the "Shanghai Coal Shortage," it has once studied them and announced its research results, saying, "We still remember that before the war, the coal consumed in Shanghai was almost entirely supplied by China itself. However, due to the situation, it was necessary to import foreign coal for supply. To determine the price of foreign coal, we must consider a major factor, namely, the change in the value of Shanghai legal tender and the increase in shipping costs. On the one hand, it is due to the decrease in the value of legal tender, and on the other hand, it is also affected by the European War. Since the outbreak of the war, all parties have increased the burden on shipowners. For example, the freight cost of transporting one ton of coal from Vietnam to Shanghai was six shillings in 1937, but now it has reached twenty-six shillings. This is more than four times higher. However, we cannot be sure of the real market price, because in terms of exchange rate, it amounts to seventy-five yuan, six jiao, and three fen, while in 1937, it was only about five yuan."</p>

<p>French Consul-General Awards Gold Medal; Colonel Essoutier and Others Hold the Funeral Ropes</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily News reported that Ba Wenbo, the Vietnamese detective who died in the line of duty during the bombing of the Great American Newspaper on April 27, was buried in the Xujiahui Cemetery on the afternoon of the 29th. Chief Superintendent Fevrier of the police station and Consul Durtal, representing the French Consul-General, led the ceremony.</p>
<p>Funeral Procession: Among those who participated in holding the funeral ropes were Colonel Essoutier, commander of the French garrison in Shanghai, Commanders Ardico des Pointes and Blanchard of the French garrison in Shanghai, Detective Brunet of the police station, Director-General Decugis of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Commander Groubeille of the French Chamber of Commerce, Special Superintendent of Detectives Davis, Chief of the Fire Brigade Berson, as well as representatives from the French Navy and Army, representatives from British and French concession agencies and organizations, and many others.</p>
<p>Scene of the Funeral: When Ba's remains were moved out of the Tailast Road mortuary, a French detective and four Chinese detectives led the way on bicycles, directing traffic. Behind them were wreaths presented by various circles, followed by the police station band. The coffin was surrounded by a line of Vietnamese detectives from Tokyo, and escorted by four groups of Vietnamese detectives and two groups of Russian detectives, to add to the solemnity. They passed through Fuli Road and Ladu Road to the Xujiahui cemetery.</p>
<p>Posthumous Honors: At the burial, Chief Superintendent Fevrier placed a gold medal of the Shanghai Municipal Council, posthumously awarded by the French Consul-General to the Vietnamese detective, on Ba's coffin. Fevrier also gave a brief speech, saying, "The list of detectives who died in the line of duty has added another name, Ba Wenbo. In recent years, Vietnamese detectives from Tokyo have always fought bravely in the face of violent attacks, until their last breath. But Ba was unable to do so. When he was answering an inquiry from a disguised gangster, he was shot in the head from behind. Although Ba did not have time to react, he died. However, the glory of his death is not diminished because of this. The gangsters knew that if Ba discovered their assassination attempt, he would fire his gun to protect himself, so they harmed Ba first in order to escape. Recently, gangsters have been rampant in Shanghai, and Vietnamese detectives have fought alongside them, facing the dangers of life and death with composure. This spirit is truly inspiring."</p>
<p>Ba's Family: Ba was only 25 years old and had been in the force for five years. He had only served in our police station for 18 months. He left behind a wife and a young son, who is only five years old, in his hometown of Du Ma (transliteration) in Nan Ting Province. We express our condolences to the widow and orphan. Ba Wenbo, I now place the medal given to you by the French Consul-General on your coffin. In the future, this medal will be sent to your home as a memento of loyalty to duty. Rest in peace." Afterwards, Vietnamese Detective Niu Nao Lin and Vietnamese Detective Yu Wan Yue (both transliterations) gave eulogies.</p>
<p>Contributions of Flowers from All Sides: Those who presented wreaths included the French Ambassador, the French Consul-General, the Chairman and all members of the Provisional Administrative Committee of the French Concession, Chief Superintendent Fevrier of the police station, the Director-General and all staff of the French Municipal Council, Detective Brunet of the police station, the Special Detective Team of the French Concession, the French garrison in Shanghai, officials of the Public Concession, and the French and Vietnamese schools.</p>

<p>Yesterday (30th) morning at around 3:00 AM, a fire suddenly broke out at Liu Yanghetang National Pharmacy, a double-front four-story building located at No. 130 and No. 132 Ningxing Street (i.e., Baoyu Lane in Caishi Street) in the French Concession, resulting in the tragic death of two men and five women, and one person being injured from a fall. The details of the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<p>Fire Started in the Kitchen on the Ground Floor</p>
<p>Liu Yanghetang National Pharmacy was originally opened in Hongkou. After the August 13th Incident, it relocated to a double-front four-story building at No. 130 and No. 132 Ningxing Street in the French Concession. The storefront was used as a pharmacy, and the upper floors were rented out to others. National doctor Liu Huilin had his clinic in the store. Business was usually good. Yesterday (30th) morning before dawn, at around 3:00 AM, a fire broke out in the kitchen behind the store (caused by carelessness in cooking tonic medicine). In an instant, the entire store was on fire. A patrolling detective noticed it, knocked on the door, but received no response. He broke open the gate, but the fire was already beyond control. Immediately, the staircase was burned down, and the fire spread to the upper floors.</p>
<p>Two Men and Five Women Burned to Death</p>
<p>The second and third floors of the pharmacy were rented by Dong Lifa, a Ningbo native, and his three generations (Dong lived on the second floor, and his son and grandchildren lived on the third floor). The fourth floor was rented by Lin Bao's family and Zhang Jin's family, etc. When the fire spread to the upper floors, Dong Lifa and others escaped to the third floor, but were all trapped by the smoke, resulting in the burning death of two men and five women, including Dong Lifa (63 years old), Dong's grandson, Guo Liang (9 years old), granddaughter, Huizhen (7 years old), an 18-year-old girl from Yangzhou (a maid), as well as fourth-floor tenants Lin Bao's family (60 years old), Zhang's family (59 years old), and Zhuan Ti's daughter-in-law, Jin (40 years old). Dong's son jumped from the third-floor window and was seriously injured, and sent to the hospital for treatment. The seven bodies of Dong Lifa and others were later dug out by workers, all resembling charred wood, a tragic sight to behold. They were all transported by car to the Tongren Fuyuan branch mortuary for examination. Wang Ren, a prosecutor from the Second Special District Court, confirmed their identities.</p>
<p>Two Buildings Destroyed by Fire</p>
<p>At that time, fire brigades from various districts of the French Concession drove to the scene to put out the fire. It was extinguished by dawn. As a result, in addition to the complete destruction of the two buildings of Liu Yanghetang Pharmacy, the coal and charcoal shop, Songtai, at No. 128 next door on the east side, and Tianjingyuan Tianjin Grocery Store at No. 3 and No. 4 next door on the west side, suffered severe water damage. Both were closed yesterday. Liu Yanghetang has a huge amount of fire insurance. The police station sent detectives to take the owner of the store to the police station to await verification. The cause of the fire is under investigation.</p>

<p>The Chinese-language edition of the North China Daily News reports that Mrs. Frl. Schlömilch, a German Jewish refugee, was knocked down by a large truck near the intersection of Zhoujiazui Road and Gongping Road at 8:35 PM on the 28th. She suffered serious injuries and died at the Shanghai Sanitarium on靶子路(Bazi Road) at 10 PM that night. The truck sped away after hitting Mrs. Schlömilch. When the police tried to investigate, they were only able to roughly determine the appearance of the truck. It is said that the truck model is similar to the Japanese military truck.</p>

<p>Wang Yigong Wins Lawsuit; Xu Guansheng Expresses Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>Xu Guansheng from Nantong established Hengren Shipping Company on Hankou Road in the winter of the year before last, and served as the manager. He hired Wang Yigong as the assistant manager. Not long after the establishment, due to financial difficulties, he wrote a note to borrow 18,000 yuan from Wang. After operating for only one month, the company went bankrupt, with huge debts. Xu entrusted Wang to be responsible for clearing the debts. As a result, Wang paid 9,700 yuan to clear various debts. However, after the company was liquidated, Xu refused to repay Wang's loan and advances. Wang hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against Xu for repayment. After receiving the lawsuit, the court opened hearings for deliberation and was presided over by Judge Yu Changzi. The defendant hired lawyer Zuo Dequan to represent him and denied the loan and advances. The court sent the promissory note and the seal presented by the defendant to the Inspection Division of the Police Affairs Department. After being appraised by the Frenchman Henry De Simone (transliteration), the appraisal was unable to make a definite conclusion. The court then sent the note to seal engraving expert Wu Fu'an for appraisal. The results confirmed that the strokes engraved in the seal on the promissory note matched the seal presented by the defendant, according to the report to the court. Judge Yu then relied on the report to make a final judgment and announced the end of the deliberation. The judgment declared that the defendant Xu Guansheng should repay the plaintiff Wang Yigong a loan of 18,000 yuan, and advances of 4,900 yuan, and an annual interest rate of six percent from the time of the lawsuit until the execution is completed. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant for six-sevenths, and by the plaintiff for one-seventh. The plaintiff's request for provisional execution was rejected. It is heard that the defendant expressed his dissatisfaction with the judgment and, after receiving the judgment, will prepare to file an appeal.</p>

The defendants refused to accept the sentence and hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Ye Shaoying, Yang Sicheng, Jiang Pingfan, and Jiang Baoli to appeal to the Second Branch of the High Court, listing reasons. The Second Branch has already interrogated them, ordered the end of the debate, and scheduled a sentencing date. All the details have been described in detail in this newspaper. It is learned that the case was judged yesterday afternoon. Because the case involved patricide, the general public wanted to see the real faces of the main characters. Therefore, even though it was the sentencing date, many people came to the courtroom, which was crowded. There were also many people standing outside the court. After a while, the male and female defendants were brought to the court separately. At 2:30 PM, the police lawyer Gan Rao Xian and the lawyers representing the appellants arrived in court one after another. The presiding Judge of the Criminal Court, Zhou Han, along with judges Mu Ruizhang and Gao Qimai, and prosecutor Lin Wopeng, took their seats and announced the judgment. The main text stated, "The appeal is rejected." It also instructed that if the parties did not accept this judgment, they could appeal to the Supreme Court within ten days of receiving the judgment. And Zhou Jing's lawyer Jiang Pingfan requested that Zhou Jing be allowed to post bail because she had a history of heart disease and was weak. The court instructed that a separate petition be submitted. After hearing the judgment of the High Court, each defendant still expressed his dissatisfaction and planned to file a third-instance appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

<p>Yang Xinzheng, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, detectives Zhang Decai and Western detective De Vere, previously in the Fuxinxiang Tobacco and Grocery Store at No. 355 Baoding Road, Hongkou, and No. 27, Lane 350, Zhoujiazui Road, cracked the biggest human trafficking agency in Shanghai's history. They arrested suspects Ling Rongsen (i.e., Ke Bin), Ling Zhang, Dai Lu (i.e., Aunt Fu), Wang Li Fu (i.e., [unreadable]), Wang Wu, Cui Sheng, Wang Zhang, Lu Wenzhong, Zhuge Chun, and Zhuge Qian, and seized two abducted children, Zhang Zhikang and Fu Bingkui, 106 pieces of children's clothing, 19 pairs of shoes, six hats, three Xiamen passes, and 40 children's photos. All of them were sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. It has been learned that the defendants committed more than 100 abduction cases in the British and French Concessions of Shanghai, which can be said to be the most innovative case of abduction cracked by the police station in recent years. It has now been verified by the police station that the owners of the lost children have identified the abducted children's clothes and photos in 52 cases, and two children have been recovered, one is Ma Xiaoniu, a six-year-old boy from the Ma family who is the gateman of the劳神父路栢薌邨 (Lao Shenfu Road Baixiang Village), and the other is Qi Renjin, a six-year-old boy from No. 583 Kangti Road. It was learned that the traffickers sold the abducted children to Xiamen. Due to special circumstances, the police station was unable to go to Xiamen to investigate. Yesterday morning, the defendants were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin Chenming presented the case, and Judge Xiao interrogated them, instructing them to wait for further review.</p>

<p>Xia Hongkui, the 16-year-old nephew of Xia Jintang, owner of the Guangfu Eye Hospital at No. 5, Lane 63, Paomating Road and a native of Jiangbei, was studying at Minli Middle School. On April 11 of this year, at 4:30 PM, Hongkui was walking alone on Weihaiwei Road after school when he was suddenly confronted by several kidnappers who threatened him with weapons.</p>
<p>Abducting Xia</p>
<p>They took him directly to Room 191 of the Tongshang Hotel on Avenue Road and imprisoned him. That night, the kidnappers thought that the cash cow had arrived and the money would come immediately, so they not only demanded a ransom of 10,000 yuan from his family, but also indulged in eating and drinking, calling their escorts, and rejoicing. Until the night was quiet, each embraced their joy and slept soundly. Unexpectedly, the hostage Xia Hongkui was extremely alert and saw that the kidnappers were</p>
<p>Soundly Asleep</p>
<p>He tiptoed and sneaked away, taking the opportunity to escape and report to the police station, who ordered detectives to arrest them. There was no trace of the kidnappers. On the 22nd, the kidnappers again called the Xia family and instructed them to send a representative to the Qingyunge Teahouse on Simalu for negotiations. The person who came was holding a newspaper and two bananas as a sign. Xia then reported to the police, who sent detectives to wait. Xia Quntang was sent as a representative to Qingyunge. After a while, Zhou Xueyi, a native of Zhenjiang,</p>
<p>Arrived to Talk</p>
<p>He said that it was inconvenient to negotiate here because there were too many people, and asked Xia to follow him to the Changle Teahouse across the street. When they arrived at Changle, he was arrested by the detectives and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Peishen took his seat in the Second Criminal Court for continued interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit according to the law and stated the case, saying that he had received a report from Xia Jintang that on April 9, the kidnappers had come to his hospital</p>
<p>To Extort 20,000</p>
<p>Yuan, and fled only after Xia shouted, etc. When asked, the defendant Zhou Xueyi made excuses, saying that he was sent by someone named Deng and did not know the contents. The court ordered the defendant to be detained.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Coffins Sent to North Shanghai; Japanese Authorities Order Removal <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Extended to June Due to No Claim</p>
<p>Before the incident in North Shanghai, there were many guild halls and houses, and there were many coffins deposited in the guild halls. Since the incident, some have been destroyed, and some coffins have been moved for cremation, but many still remain. Two months ago, the Japanese authorities suddenly issued an order, citing summer hygiene, ordering the owners of the coffins to move them all elsewhere by the end of April. If they were not moved by the deadline, they would all be cremated. However, in the past two months, very few people have come to claim them, and various agencies in North Shanghai have repeatedly extorted and harassed the coffin owners by using the deadline for moving the coffins as an excuse. Recently, it was learned that this method has not been effective in North Shanghai, so they have extended the deadline by another six months. If the coffins are not moved by October 31 of this year, they will be cremated. (Huawen News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e96">National Education Conference Revises and Passes Key Points for Guaranteeing Facilities in National Schools <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail News) The National Education Conference of various provinces and cities is being held in Chongqing, as reported in this newspaper. The Ministry of Education has announced the 17 articles of the "Key Points for Guaranteeing Facilities in National Schools," which were revised and passed by the conference. The full text is recorded below:</p>
<p>(Article 1) These key points are formulated in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 3 of the Outline for the Implementation of National Education. (Article 2) For the purpose of popularizing national education, national schools are established in each bao (administrative unit) and are called "National School of Bao X". (Article 3) The principle is to establish one national school per bao. If a bao has a dense population but an area of less than four square li, or if a natural unit of one village or street cannot be separated, a joint school may be established by two or three bao, called "Joint National School of Bao X and Bao Y". If a bao is too vast and the villages are scattered, the national school may establish classes in each village, or implement itinerant teaching by setting up itinerant teaching classes. Bao that already have a central school and are within three li of the central school will not establish a separate national school. Children and the public who should attend school should enroll in the primary school department and the public education department of the central school. (Article 4) National schools should be located where the bao office is located, and the school buildings should be adjacent to the bao office in principle. (Article 5) The primary school department should follow the structure of a junior primary school, with four grades from the first grade to the fourth grade. School-age children aged six to twelve within the bao should be admitted to receive four, two, or one year of national primary school education. Kindergartens or kindergarten classes may be attached. The public education department should establish at least one elementary adult class and one elementary women's class. In accordance with the revised regulations for public schools, out-of-school people aged fifteen to thirty-five should be admitted as a priority to receive elementary remedial education. Advanced adult classes and women's classes may be established to admit graduates from the elementary adult or women's classes to receive advanced remedial education. The primary school department and the public education department may, depending on local circumstances, admit out-of-school children over twelve years of age but under fifteen years of age to receive education. (Article 6) When children enter the primary school department of a national school, they should be grouped into classes according to their age, intelligence, etc. The number of students per class should be around 50. Depending on local circumstances, a two-shift system or a combined single-grade system may be adopted. The public education department may conduct teaching by dividing classes according to occupation and gender. The number of students per class should be around 50. (Article 7) The primary school department of a national school should hold classes during the day. The curriculum and teaching hours should be in accordance with the primary school curriculum standards and the short-term primary school curriculum standards. (Article 8) The expenses of national schools should be raised by the bao in principle. The methods for raising funds will be determined separately. (Article 9) The primary school department of a national school does not charge tuition fees. Necessary school supplies may be sold to children by the school in conjunction with local cooperative organizations. The public education department does not charge tuition fees. Textbooks should be requested by the school from the county and municipal governments. (Article 10) A national school should have one principal to preside over the school's affairs. In areas with more developed economies and education, the county government should select qualified personnel as stipulated in Article 64 of the Revised Regulations for Primary Schools or certified personnel to serve full-time. In areas with difficult talent and economic conditions, the principal may temporarily serve concurrently as the bao chief or deputy bao chief. A bao chief or deputy bao chief who is qualified as a primary school principal may also temporarily serve as the principal. (Article 11) If the principal of a national school concurrently serves as the bao chief, a full-time teacher should be added within the possible scope to serve concurrently as the director of teaching, assisting the principal in handling school affairs. (Article 12) Teachers of national schools should be selected by the principal and hired from those who are qualified as stipulated in Article 62 of the Revised Regulations for Primary Schools and those who are certified. In areas with difficult talent and economic conditions, substitute teachers may be hired in accordance with the provisions of Article 66 of the Revised Regulations for Primary Schools. (Article 13) Teachers of national schools should handle affairs of the bao office in addition to their teaching work hours. (Article 14) National schools should, depending on local needs, carry out various social education undertakings in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of the Revised Regulations for Public Schools. (Article 15) Within one month after the beginning of each semester, national schools should report the school's organization, financial equipment, and general situation, as well as the roster of teachers and staff, the roster of enrolled children, and the roster of enrolled people, to the township (town) office and submit them to the competent education administrative organ for record. (Article 16) The financial budget, staffing, training, equipment, performance evaluation, teachers and staff, etc. of national schools should comply with the provisions of the Revised Regulations for Primary Schools and the Revised Regulations for Public Schools, except as otherwise provided in these regulations. (Article 17) These key points shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Guangdong Province Develops Social Education <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Universally Holding Public Schools, Seeking Ways to Increase Social Education Funding</p>
<p>(Shaoguan Airmail News) Since taking office, Huang Linshu, Director of the Education Department of Guangdong Province, has continued the unfinished work of former Director Xu, actively developing social education. The progress includes: (A) Universally Holding Public Schools: Using existing primary and secondary schools to carry out the work effectively. According to statistics, there are more than 24,000 primary schools in the province, with more than 54,000 classes and more than 62,000 teachers. Assuming that one-tenth of them are used, at least 5,000 public school classes can be run each term. Secondary schools run more public school classes than primary schools. Assuming that each school runs two classes, a total of 500 classes can be run, which can accommodate 275,000 people each term. Three terms can be run each year, totaling 825,000 people. After the implementation of the new county system, each township central school has established three departments for children, adults, and women. (B) Developing the Central Business Regulations of the Public Education Center, stipulating central work, supervising the handling, so that the Public Education Center becomes the leading social education organ in the area, completing the great task of organizing and training the public. (C) Improving the Efficiency of Social Work Teams: The Education Department has established three detachments of social education work teams directly under it. Last year, they were sent to work in Dongjiang and Huiyang, achieving considerable results. They are now being assembled back to the department for short-term training, and then sent to various counties in the northern Guangdong war zone, so as to give full play to the team's service capacity and effectively assist the local authorities in carrying out various revitalization projects. After the work in the northern Guangdong war zone is completed, they will be sent to other counties close to the war zone. (D) The total social education funding submitted throughout the year is only more than 1.3 million yuan, which is only 6% of the total education funding of more than 21 million yuan spent annually in the province. This is far from the standard that social education funding should account for 20% of the total. Attention has been paid to this, and efforts are being made to give social education an opportunity to progress.</p>

<p>Pan Rixi Wins Over Li Zongpei; There Are Four Matches Tonight</p>
<p>The Third Jingwu Cup All-Shanghai Individual Table Tennis Championship, after the ten group champions were produced, opened the round-robin tournament the night before at the association's billiard room. In the first schedule, there were originally five matches, but Huang Fen, who won the seventh group championship, happened to go to Fuzhou for business on that day and voluntarily gave up, which was a pity. The clashes between the groups were quite fierce, with the battle between Pan Rixi, a new player in the third group, and the short-blocking expert Li Zongpei being the most intense. Li seemed very careless when he took the court, while Pan was careful and cautious, taking the lead step by step. Although Li wanted to recover, it was too late. In the final game, he was defeated by Pan by a score of 11 to 9, a one-point difference. A major upset occurred in the first act, which was beyond the audience's expectations. There are still four matches tonight.</p>

<h3 id="e106">Finance: Capitalizing on Rumors, Gold Market Suddenly Reverses: Astonishing Buying Arises After Low Prices; Consecutive Breaches of the Two-Hundred-Yuan Mark <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold price in the Shanghai market first fell and then suddenly soared, returning to above the 5,600 yuan mark. It then repeatedly rose above 5,700 yuan. Sentiment uniformly turned firm, and the bullish side gained momentum. In fact, the long-term speculators who had been subdued for a long time released empty rumors, and there was even a rumor of issuing gold treasury bonds. The foreign exchange suddenly tightened, which aroused the astonishing buying that had not been seen for eleven days. Because the foreign exchange was hardening, the bullish side still cut profits. Therefore, the opening price was low at 5,510 yuan. Shortly after, it saw a low price of 5,505 yuan. Later, rumors suddenly rose, and money changers, securities firms, and gold shops successively poured in. Upon hearing that the foreign exchange also softened, the sellers were even more hesitant to move forward. The price soared above 5,600 yuan. The upward momentum became more acute at noon, and in the afternoon, it jumped above the 5,700 yuan mark again, seeing a high price of 5,730 yuan. Fortunately, the exchange's tightening was limited, and the closing price slightly fell back to 5,693 yuan, a rebound of 121 yuan. The overall trading was quite active, above 3,000 taels. Jewelry gold was also once listed as low as 550 yuan, and later rose to 575 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. Customs gold, etc., were all flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rebounds by One Hundred and Twenty Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, the exchange rate reported a long position, and the U.S. exchange rate reported a hard position. Sentiment was extremely exhausted. At the opening, there was a sell-off, first from a gold shop issuing 30 taels from a securities firm, at 5,510 yuan, lower than the previous day by 62 yuan. Later, a securities firm aggressively advanced, suddenly seeing a rebound of 23 yuan. The securities firm entered the silver shop for 20 taels, at 5,530 yuan. At that time, most retail investors were still bearish and were constantly selling, while a securities firm suddenly turned from buying to selling, falling back 27 yuan. The silver shop issued 20 taels to the gold shop, less than 5,505 yuan. Later, the securities firm came back to frantically scoop up, coupled with money changers and silver shops also coming to compete to buy, and retail short sellers also rose up to cover their positions. The position suddenly felt exhausted, and it soared 95 yuan. The gold shop entered the securities firm for 20 taels, at 5,600 yuan. After this, the buying momentum was slightly frustrated, and money changers sold out some, immediately returning 30 yuan. The money changers made mutual transactions of 20 taels, at 5,570 yuan. Finally, because favorable news came from the market, the buying momentum rose again, and the silver shops absorbed the gold shops with extra effort, and it soon soared 105 yuan. The silver shop entered the money changers for 20 taels, at 5,675 yuan. Near the close, the money changers sold out, and then fell back 10 yuan. The money changers issued 20 taels to the gold shop, at 5,665 yuan as the noon closing price. After the opening in the afternoon, sentiment was even better. Although a securities firm sold out, asking for 5,700 yuan, the general retail investors did not think it was expensive, and scrambled to buy. It is estimated that the securities firm filled money changers, etc. with dozens of taels, all at 5,700 yuan. Later buyers still poured in, rising another 30 yuan. The silver shop entered the gold shop for 20 taels, at 5,730 yuan. But at that time, the gold shops and other bulls took profits, and the buyers gradually decreased, so it returned to the 5,700 yuan mark. The silver shop issued 20 taels to the securities firm, retreating to 5,680 yuan. After entering, the selling momentum gradually subsided, and the silver shops and money changers successively scooped up, and again rushed out of the 5,700 yuan mark. The silver shop entered the gold shops, etc. for 50 taels, at 5,725 yuan. Later, the silver shops suddenly saw high and came out again, so it fell 32 yuan. The silver shop issued 20 taels to the money changers, at 5,693 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it rebounded 121 yuan compared with the previous day, with a fluctuation of 225 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the spot gold of the present brand gold shop is several yuan higher than the spot gold, and the purchase price is reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold is about 50 or 60 yuan lower than the listed gold.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>For silver and gold jewelry, each tael was first suspended at 565 yuan by Da Tong Hang. It was reduced by 10 yuan at 9:30 AM, rebounded by 5 yuan at 10:30 AM, increased by 5 yuan again at 11:00 AM, and increased by 5 yuan again at 11:15 AM. At 12:09 PM, it increased by 5 yuan again. As a result, it rose a total of 10 yuan. It is estimated that Da Tong Hang changed to suspend at 575 yuan. The new industry has the same price as the above, and the purchase price is reduced by 15 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Multiple Bulls Close Out Clearly, Foreign Exchange Has New Buyers Again <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange market first loosened then rebounded, ultimately softening. The situation was relatively lively. Initially, speculators frantically sold, causing prices to fall continuously. The British pound for April even reached 1/4 15/625. However, it was heard that HSBC absorbed a good amount, buying in a lot of British pounds at 1/4 14/0625. Therefore, by noon, speculators saw the situation suddenly reverse and turned from selling to buying, causing a tight squeeze. In the afternoon, speculators continued to pile in, and the earlier supply shortage led to a soft undertone. As a result, the closing price for the British pound was 1/4 125, and the US dollar was 6 yuan 03125, which was 015625 and 03125 tighter than the previous day, respectively. The futures trend was similar to the spot market.</p>
<p>The Opening Was Very Loose</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large volume contracts, both near and far, were up 1/875, New York silver prices remained flat, and London spot gold was stable. Exchange rates for British pounds against US dollars, Shanghai, and France were all flat. The US dollar rose 1/125 against the British pound, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and rose 1/125 against France. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning, with the British pound at 1/4 14/0625 and the US dollar at 6 yuan 0625, both flat compared to the previous night's close. Futures also opened unchanged at the same time. Selling pressure rose immediately after opening, with speculators selling the most. The market then showed hardening. It was estimated that speculators sold April US dollars to outsiders at a loose price of 6 yuan 09375 to 6 yuan 125, and simultaneously sold May US dollars to outsiders at 5 yuan 875. HSBC's listed prices were announced as unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced to have risen by 1 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen. Subsequently, speculators continued to unload, and those with interests and outsiders also intended to sell. However, China United and the Mainland made some closing purchases. At that time, outsiders bought April central gold from speculators at 1/4 7/15625. Unexpectedly, around 10 o'clock, Chinese merchants had many contracts expiring this month and gradually closed out clearly. As the selling pressure subsided, banks absorbed very well. Interests sold May US dollars to Chinese banks and the Mainland at 5 yuan 84375 and 8125, a slight rebound from before. Later, speculators stopped selling, and it was also heard that HSBC's absorption became stronger, and the market immediately tightened. By noon closing, the British pound was 1/4 125 and the US dollar was 6 yuan 03125, a contraction of 015625 and 02125 compared to the opening. Futures also tightened.</p>
<p>British and American Spot and Futures Tighten</p>
<p>The market was still stable in the afternoon. After opening, speculators purchased May US dollars from outsiders at 5 yuan 8125, and June US dollars at 5 yuan 59375.

<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market initially saw the pound price suddenly rise by 2/125. The black market foreign exchange loosened, and gold prices returned to the 5,500 yuan mark, causing the British and American gold pounds to continue to fall. US dollar notes once returned to 16 yuan 1 jiao 1 fen. After that, due to rumors about circulating notes, gold prices rapidly turned and rose, and foreign exchange suddenly became tight. The buying interest in foreign currencies sharply increased, forcing the US dollar notes to rise to 16 yuan 4 jiao by noon. In the afternoon, it continued to rise to 16 yuan 4 jiao and a half, then slightly retreated to 16 yuan 3 jiao 7 fen, which was 1 jiao 7 fen higher than the previous day.

<h3 id="e109">Securities: Foreign Stock Speculation Shifts to British United, Domestic Bonds Have Considerable Fluctuations, Foreign Bonds Remain Stable <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>In the securities unofficial market, all bonds rose slowly yesterday. Initially, due to No. 41 suddenly having a purchase of 400,000, it caused short covering by various retail investors. At the same time, due to the rise in gold prices, rumors arose, some saying that the treasury would be implemented, and others saying that a pseudo-bank would be established. Although it was clearly known to be fabricated, this kind of atmosphere was most likely to fluctuate the market. The goodness of each bond was half based on this, but it could not be proven, so it weakened again slightly in the afternoon. Yesterday morning, No. 41 purchased according to the market, followed by Datong, Hongda, Renchang, and Fengda, either covering shorts or going long. The market price rose very sharply. Although Lianhe, Tongshun, Runli, and scattered retail investors sold, the buying interest was still strong. Class A bonds were bound to break through 9 yuan. Transactions had cleared by the afternoon, and the market price was flat and weak. Lianhe, Lianyi, Xieda, and Taifeng all sold. As a result, it had risen from jiao ban to 6 jiao. The transaction volume was about more than 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, a large number of shares of Dada Steamship Company were traded, 50 shares at a price of 62 yuan. The essence of the stock market for various industries yesterday was entirely occupied by British United. 69,090 shares were traded, with the price soaring from 55 yuan to 61 yuan and a half, and closing at 60 yuan. Yeguang, China Reclamation, Yangtze, Jardine Matheson, and others also followed suit. The transaction volume was second only to British United. Jardine Matheson shares had an isolated bid (meaning no one bid) at a low price of around 170 yuan at the opening. Soon, buyers came to purchase one after another, and it was immediately raised to 199 yuan. The closing price was 197 yuan and a half for purchase. Based on yesterday's transaction volume and price, British United shares exceeded 4 million yuan, and Jardine Matheson shares also had a transaction volume of 1.5 million yuan. The buying interest in Zilai Fire shares was exceptionally good, as it was rumored that the procedures for selling its surplus real estate had been completed.</p>
<p>The buyers of rubber stocks were not very enthusiastic, but within a narrow range, there was its own supply and demand. The price was almost unchanged from before.</p>
<p>London, 29th (blank) Dispatch: Today's listed prices of Chinese foreign bonds and shares of British-owned Far East companies were all stable, and the market conditions were neither good nor bad.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Yarn and Cloth: The Yarn Market is Chaotic, The Same 20-Count Yarn Differs by Over 100 Yuan <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>After several days of frantic rises in the yarn market, there was a slight reaction, due to the lack of spot sales. However, sentiment remained good, and most people were optimistic. Therefore, the selling price of the same count of yarn differed by more than 100 yuan, which shows the chaotic nature of the yarn market. The price of 20-count Double Globe yarn was about 200 yuan higher than Double Horse    . The spot yarn opened flat in the morning, and the market was quiet. The unit price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,560 yuan, down 10 yuan from the previous day. Then, with the activity of buyers, it rose again, reaching 1,586 yuan to 90 yuan. Unexpectedly, high prices brought out long positions, and at the same time, actual demand was weak, and speculative sentiment rose again, and it fell straight to 1,543 yuan. The transaction volume in half a day was estimated to be 1,375 bales. Apart from the spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn falling by 20 yuan, 307 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong in one day. The amounts bought by each group are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same Trade 1,000 Hong Kong 155</p>
<p>Ningbo 00 Mainland 210</p>

<p>Transactions of domestic cotton were cut off, but transactions of Indian cotton were still able to support the market. However, they were all transactions between the same traders. The mills remained calm, so the market was not very exciting. However, the trend was still upward. The transaction situation of spot cotton is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton cloth market was active yesterday morning, but it was very stable. After that, due to purchases by the same industry and foreign cotton merchants, the futures are expected to rise by three pounds in tone. The Indian cotton market was extraordinarily excited due to the widespread rumors that India and Japan were negotiating, and that Japanese cotton yarn and cloth could be exchanged for Indian cotton. Therefore, yesterday, together with the forecasts, it rose more than seven rupees. The Egyptian market was closed yesterday.</p>
<p>Another News: The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai was very active yesterday. Due to the increasing scarcity of spot goods in the market, there were many inquiries about futures among the same industry, and some orders were placed. However, they were all for Indian cotton to be shipped in June and Brazilian cotton to be shipped in July. Whether they can be shipped on time is still doubtful. The factory price converted at the US dollar exchange rate of 6 yuan is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Grain: Both Northern and Southern Rice are Controlled, This is the Main Reason for High Rice Prices. Yesterday's Market Went From Weak to Firm <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market tightened again. Early in the morning, there were inland village customers searching for cheap goods. The actual buying interest of shops was also more active. The situation at that time was quite prosperous, and shouts rose again, with the prices of various goods increasing by 3-5 jiao to 6-7 jiao. Small Jiaojin entered and exited the most and opened at 41 yuan 4 jiao. However, the stock of a certain store was very tightly held, and customers still insisted on not buying unless it was cheap. Once the price was high, it immediately slackened. The market stagnated in the middle of the day, and the overall situation was hesitant. It softened back by 2-3 jiao, and small Jiaojin was only 42 yuan 2 jiao. It dragged on for a long time like this, without any change. Just as the market was about to close, suddenly the general floating hoarders who had been watching saw that the market was not easy to plummet again and believed that the foothold was firm and there was an opportunity to be seized. Therefore, they suddenly rushed in at the moment of closing, forming a flurry of activity. The market rebounded again, similar to the morning market. It was estimated that the closing price of No. 1 4 Tribute was 46 yuan and a half to 46 yuan 3 jiao, and small Jiaojin was 42 yuan 4 jiao. The arrival of various types of state rice, such as thick and thin Japonica rice, suddenly turned scarce. Those arriving at the port were only 4-5 cars of Chang粳 and more than 700 bales of Qingjiao Nangang early and late rice. The owners shouted higher prices for the rebounding foreign rice, but the trading in the market was still not fresh, so the price also increased by 5 jiao. Changkun Su粳 and Nangang Hu early millet were sold at 40 yuan. It was heard that unofficial markets outside the market were mutually attracting each other and rising in unison. The opening price of Wuxi Special Qing粳 was 45 yuan and a half, Large market 45 yuan, Fen粳 44 yuan, Changzhou Qing粳 45 yuan, 44 yuan and a half, Fen胚 43 yuan and a half, Kunshan White粳 44 yuan and a half to 43 yuan and a half, Qingsi Zhen Special Thin Rice 45 yuan and a half, Special 45 yuan, Chong Special 44 yuan, Large Market 43 yuan and a half to 43 yuan, Nangang original package early rice 43 yuan, 42 yuan 2 jiao, Duzi Jian 43 yuan, 42 yuan and a half. Glutinous rice, however, lacked prosperity because the road ahead was not broad and only maintained the original market. Looking back at the source of state rice, it started from the Da Chang Company in the Hongkou District in the northern city, transporting it from the mainland, and gradually being able to loosen it every day. Recently, it was heard that in the southern city, in the old site of the Miscellaneous Grain Association, a so-called Minsheng Rice Grain Association was also established. All the daily needs of rice and grain for rice shops and refugees in the district were exclusively transported and sold by the association. It was also planned that when goods were surging, they would also plan to transport and sell within the border. However, the surface seemed to be written by a Chinese organization, and behind it was fully supported by the Japanese side, etc.</p>
<p>Although the arrival of foreign rice has been strong for several consecutive days, the actual sales to local customers were very good yesterday morning, and there were also hoarders inquiring, so the market price rose by 7-8 jiao early in the morning. Then, due to reduced sales and unloading by hoarders, the market once retreated slightly by 2-3 jiao at noon. However, it was affected by the gold market in the afternoon and aroused absorption by large merchants and hoarders, The initial price of No. 2 Western goods that had arrived and were immediately delivered once fell to 51 yuan 7 jiao, but in the afternoon, due to the competitive purchase by new hoarders, it rose to 52 yuan and a half. The 4-5 day road goods rose from 52 yuan and a half in the morning to 53 yuan 05 fen in the afternoon, a sudden increase of half a yuan 7-8 jiao. The spot price of small Jiaojin was the lowest at 42 yuan in the morning, the highest at 52 yuan and a half in the early market, retreated by two jiao at noon, and then rose to 43 yuan 2 jiao in the afternoon, a difference of 1 yuan 2 jiao throughout the day, The inflow and outflow for the whole day were booming. It is said that 7-8,000 bags of spot rice were opened, and there were also more than 400 tons of futures and road goods that were immediately delivered.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 2,113 bags of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, carried by the Taikoo Company's Guiyang wheel, transported from Hong Kong. In addition, the company's Suzhou wheel exported to Qingdao last night. It was heard that the wheel loaded 5,831 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong and transported it to Qingdao (rented).</p>

<p>The flour market was dull and lifeless. Although the price of No. 2 Flour Factory had been reduced by a small triangle, the sales on the street were still flat, and the sales to customers showed no signs of improvement. The recycled goods of the old brand had already dropped by triangle and a half due to the influence of the factory price being lowered, and only opened at 13 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen. Other inland miscellaneous brand flours also had drops to within 13 yuan, but both sellers and buyers were still holding on, so the market did not get rid of its quiet state.</p>
<p>There was slight trading in the wheat market. It had been held up for many days. The holders had no intention of unloading urgently, as there were currently two inventories of goods. Yesterday, due to the continuous decline in the flour market, the future of raw materials would naturally have a related impact, so the selling price also showed a slight decline. It was estimated that more than 1,000 bags of Kai錫 and other wheat were opened at a price of 20 yuan 08 jiao to 20 yuan 06 jiao and a half, all of which were handled by Fufeng Factory. Fuxin has not yet handled it, and customers and Japanese factories rarely inquire.</p>

<p>A batch of crude sugar was opened by Taikoo Yoko in this city, according to O.I.F.I.O. regulations, the price was 5.05 Dutch guilders, a discount of 5 fen. The association's pricing was also slightly loose. Spot 24 crude white local warehouse goods were relatively stable at 63 yuan 3 jiao, new foreign warehouse goods were 62 yuan 9 jiao to 8 jiao, July old goods were 62 yuan 6 jiao, a small discount of 2 jiao.

Taikoo car white was stable, B mark old goods were 72 yuan, new goods were 73 yuan 4 jiao, CW mark was 73 yuan, CX mark was 72 yuan and a half, DY mark was 72 yuan, HX mark was 71 yuan 8 jiao. Car red Dutch red remained unchanged. However, the local factory's snow white was a small discount of 2 jiao at 62 yuan 8 jiao. According to the letter from the production area of domestic sugar Qingdao, the handling price is rising. Now the application is required for 55-60 yuan, exceeding the Shanghai market by 2-3 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a large amount of sugar was shipped to Qingdao, totaling 6,490 bags of granulated sugar and 1,436 bags of Taikoo car sugar, which was loaded on the Taikoo Company's Suzhou wheel from Hong Kong via Shanghai and transshipped to Qingdao. Yesterday, another 500 bags of sugar arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>New tea from Zhejiang Province has been concentrated in large quantities in Hangzhou for listing in recent days. Tea merchants from Shanghai have gathered there. For domestic sales, the price of Lion Peak Longjing is from 670-80 yuan to 730-40 yuan per dan. The price of Mao Feng also needs to be around 400 yuan. The opening price of stir-fried green for foreign sales is 330-40 yuan, and because there are many buyers, it continues to rise to 360-70 yuan. It is heard that the new goods on this road will be loaded and shipped to Shanghai within days.</p>
<p>The sales of foreign merchants' silk and tea are still sluggish. Although Xiehe, Tongfu, and other firms have negotiated prices, they have not heard of any transactions because the distance is too far. Most merchants are waiting to see because the market is full of old goods. 700 pieces of tea were shipped from Ningbo on the 30th, and another 138 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong in one day.</p>

<h3 id="e116">On Calamities and Anomalies <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>A wise man said, "If strange things are not considered strange, then very strange things will become extinct." In ancient times, when encountering extraordinary events, sages always cultivated their virtues in order to turn anomalies into auspiciousness. Confucius established teachings with words, and strangeness was not to be spoken of; but in the Book of Spring and Autumn, in the 242 years, the recorded calamities and anomalies numbered 122. In the sky, there were eclipses and meteor showers; on the earth, there were earthquakes and collapses; among things, there were 　蜮 and 鵒; and the seasons of plum trees, beans, grass, and cereals violated the seasons, and rain, hail, thunder, and lightning missed the proper times. Pigs cried, dragons fought, snakes emerged, stones spoke, or human affairs were foreseen, also corresponding to anomalies; or demonic signs appeared first, and disasters followed, all intended to make people fearful and reflective. The Zuo Zhuan said, "Demons arise from people; if people have no faults, demons will not arise spontaneously; people　often create demons." Their arrogance is the cause. It is said that when a state is about to rise, there must be auspicious signs; when a state is about to fall, there must be demonic signs. Only utmost sincerity can know beforehand, and only utmost sincerity can be cautious. Therefore, if virtue is sufficient to overcome it, even a pheasant crowing on a mulberry tree will not be a calamity; if virtue is insufficient to match it, even a dragon appearing or a unicorn emerging will be inauspicious. Anything contrary to the norm is strange. If etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are not known, if filial piety, brotherly love, loyalty, and trustworthiness are not practiced, if one speaks knowingly and acts rashly, if there are obvious human wrongs and hidden ghostly spirits, what Heaven should condemn and what the king's law should not tolerate, the coming of disaster can be watched with bated breath, what could be stranger than this!</p>

<h3 id="e117">The Talent of Speech (1) <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>We all need the talent of speech. When we speak, we simultaneously bear a significant responsibility because the talent of speech is both an opportunity and a danger. Poor speech can ruin one's reputation and alienate friends, while good speech can positively influence the entire environment. Therefore, the talent of speech is extremely important. It can help oneself, but if it's bad, it can hinder oneself. James the Apostle, in his epistle, stated this very clearly, saying, "If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us, we can turn the whole animal. Or take ships, which are very large and are driven by strong winds, are steered by a very small rudder wherever the pilot wants to go. Likewise, the tongue is a small part of the body, but it makes great boasts. A great forest fire can start from a small spark. All kinds of animals, birds, reptiles and sea creatures can be tamed, but no one can tame the tongue." If a person is intelligent and knowledgeable, they can demonstrate wisdom and humility in their speech. Everyone can speak, but the crucial question is whether what we say has value. Let us see how Jesus used his talent of speech. Jesus was a missionary who often had to speak, and at length. He understood that there were privileges and dangers in this. Therefore, he was very careful about what he said and how he said it. We should learn from Jesus' example and show our wisdom, knowledge, and humility in the words we speak every day. First, we see that Jesus knew when to remain silent. The scriptures record many instances of his silence. He remained silent because he knew when it was inappropriate to speak. "Like a sheep led to the slaughter, or a lamb before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth." When people whipped him, mocked him, and nailed him to the cross, he never retorted, only asking God to forgive them. (To be continued) For detailed study, please write to P.O. Box 1227.</p>
<h3 id="e118">How to Commemorate Labor Day <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Fang</p>
<p>May is an eventful month. "May 1st" is International Labor Day, "May 3rd" is the Jinan Massacre Memorial Day, "May 4th" is Youth Day, and "May 5th" is the Founding Day of the National Government. Other days like "May 9th", "May 18th", and "May 30th" are also significant and deeply meaningful memorial days commemorating the national revolutionary struggles filled with sorrow and indignation.</p>
<p>Today is the first day of May in the 29th year of the Republic of China, and also International Labor Day. Of course, on this day, laborers all over the world will deeply commemorate and reminisce about the successes of past struggles and hardships. However, we in Shanghai, with our particularly unique circumstances, will have an indelible impression of how to commemorate Labor Day today. At the same time, the author would like to take advantage of this Labor Day to offer a word to both labor and management in this city, that is, to explain the profound meaning of commemorating Labor Day.</p>
<p>We know that Shanghai is the Paris of China, and its prosperity is obvious without much thought. However, this was the situation before "August 13th." After the baptism of the fires of war that began on August 13th, prosperity has declined. Even if it seems more prosperous on the surface, it is an abnormal phenomenon. In essence, it is gradually heading towards decline, because everything is much more difficult than before, especially the low production of industry and commerce, the great risks, and the people's daily lives being tossed about in the extremely tense and surging tides.</p>
<p>Recently, due to these various reasons, labor and management in various industrial and commercial sectors have often been in a state of friction and unrest. The tide of strikes is brewing at any time and anywhere, threatening to erupt at any moment. However, stepping back, the prosperity of an industry or commerce depends entirely on how well labor and management can cooperate and conspire. Although today's factories are affected by transportation difficulties, the difficulty of obtaining raw materials, and increased costs, in order to cope with the difficult reality, and for the sake of the business itself and the livelihood of the laborers, it is absolutely impossible to have even one day of unintentional management. Conversely, on the part of many workers, due to the soaring prices of necessities, the meager salaries or daily wages are not enough to maintain life. However, they can only take into consideration the achievement of the nation's difficult goals and the limitations of the overall situation. They should also understand the factory authorities' difficulties before making reasonable demands and should not be instigated by others to deliberately cause trouble. Because Shanghai today, in addition to the stimulation of the high cost of living, is also full of traps for people to fall into. Labor and management must clearly recognize this most important point in today's Labor Day commemoration and remembrance. Therefore, how to commemorate Labor Day must focus on the social wage, the automatic wage increases within the possible range of the employer, the ability of workers to practice frugality, and the ability to work happily together to overcome this difficult and arduous environment.</p>
<h3 id="e119">A Survey of Shanghai Workers' Lives <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Da Chuan</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the "August 13th" war in Shanghai, major factories once came to a standstill, but soon the situation stabilized slightly, and most foreign factories restored their original scale. Last year, the outbreak of the European War again stimulated Shanghai's factories, and production and sales became increasingly prosperous. The number of workers increased sharply, almost equal to that before the war. However, almost 70% of the workers work in Yangshupu and West Shanghai, so those who care about the welfare of laborers are very concerned about them.</p>
<p>On the blockaded isolated island, the cost of living is increasing day by day. Compared with before the war, it has more than quadrupled. Under this circumstance, the lives of workers are most worthy of attention.</p>
<p>First, let's take a look at the wages of male and female workers. According to a survey of 45 worker families by the Hudong Huashe Nursery, the average (Mean) monthly wage for male workers is 19.05 yuan, and for female workers is 17.8 yuan, only two or three yuan more than before the war. The workers surveyed mostly work in British and Japanese cotton mills in Yangshupu, so this statistic is quite accurate. If both husband and wife work in the factory, the average monthly income is only 46.85 yuan, not to mention that both husband and wife may be unemployed. According to statistics, in the 45 worker families, the average number of people per family is 2.7, of which 18 families have four people, accounting for the largest number; 12 families have three people, accounting for the second largest number. It can be seen that these families are very simple, mostly from the inland countryside. If there are parents and children left in their hometown, there must be many who send money home monthly for household expenses. Now, based on a monthly income of 46.85 yuan per family, the minimum monthly food cost is 35 yuan, the minimum rent is 8 yuan, what are they supposed to do with the remaining 2 yuan and 8 jiao 5 fen? What about the elderly parents and starving children in their hometown? And the children they bring with them have no one to take care of during the day, and childcare and education are extremely difficult problems.</p>
<p>Secondly, their working hours are also illegal. Male workers work an average of 9 hours and 37 minutes per day, and female workers work 11 hours and 17 minutes. The latter mostly have to leave home at 5 am every morning, start work at 5:30 am, and can only leave work at 6 pm. Many also have to work seven nights a week.</p>
<p>Therefore, we very much hope that: First, if the price of factory goods increases, workers' wages should also be increased proportionally; Second, the prices of various daily necessities should be suppressed, at least when accepting merchants' requests to increase prices, twelve points of consideration should be given. If these two points can be achieved, then the lives of workers may be brought to a reasonable level.</p>

<p>Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Companions, Articles are Valuable; Famous Scenic Spots, Management Obtains the Right People</p>
<p>Although this car was spacious, there were quite a few people in it today. Besides Mrs. Su Liya and their newlywed couple, there were also the five Zhu Ai’ren sisters, already eight people. Adding the driver, there were a total of nine people. Moreover, Mrs. Su Liya was of double the size, and she often took up two seats by herself. Fortunately, the car was like a small family, with everything one could need. If you wanted to sleep in the car, you could immediately set up two mandarin duck beds, with all the brocade quilts and embroidered bedding arranged. Since the berths were not needed at the moment, the beds were turned into sofa chairs. It could be considered suitable for all four seasons. Originally, this car also had a small kitchen, equipped with an electric stove and various tableware. However, it could only provide food for three or four people, which was not enough for eight people now. Therefore, they planned to go to Wuxi for dinner today. The car only had some bread, cold food, coffee, and soda, for snacks. What was especially pleasing was that the weather was clear, the scenery was fresh, the chrysanthemums were yellow, and the maple leaves were gradually turning red, making everyone's spirits even higher. Although Mrs. Su Liya was American, she spoke excellent Chinese. Because she had been in China for so many years, she regarded China as her second nationality. In many ways, she had become Chinese. Even her own countrymen called her an old China hand. She only had a child in America, and handling her many properties, she had to return to America often. She said that her child would also come to China after graduating from university. They were already studying Chinese for an hour every day at school. In addition, Mrs. Su Liya was very dashing and humorous, and she was even more congenial with a group of young and progressive Chinese girls. At this time, they talked and laughed all the way, as the car drove straight towards Suzhou. When they talked about the Women and Children's Hospital and the Nursery where Zhu Ai'ren worked, Mrs. Su Liya asked if Dr. Lao Zhang was doing well, they hadn’t seen each other in a long time. It turned out that when Zhu Ai'ren came to Shanghai this time, she wanted to ask Mrs. Su Liya for help with the development of the two hospitals and the training of talents. Mrs. Su Liya had also helped a lot with public welfare in China. Zhu Ai'ren had already asked Jin Danyu to talk to Mrs. Su Liya about this matter, and she readily agreed. She could not only help herself, but she was also willing to solicit donations from her American friends. Because now all corners of the world are one family, there is no distinction between borders.

<h3 id="e122">The Filming Process of "Confessions of a Nazi Spy" <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>The sensational Warner anti-German film "Confessions of a Nazi Spy" will be released at the Shanghai Guangda Theater tomorrow. Therefore, I have written a brief account of the filming process of this film by Warner.</p>
<p>Anti-German Vanguard</p>
<p>Last spring, Hollywood film companies began to announce plans to produce a large number of anti-German and anti-fascist films. For a time, Hollywood films, which could also represent American films, were all based on commerce and did not contain political functions. This was the traditional policy of film merchants. But since the news came out, everyone realized that Hollywood films were beginning to lean towards politics. Among them, Warner was especially recognized as the anti-German vanguard. However, many producers later stopped filming, and only Warner continued as usual. It truly deserves to be called the anti-German vanguard, and Warner's first shot was "Confessions of a Nazi Spy"!</p>
<p>Story Content</p>
<p>The story of "Confessions of a Nazi Spy" depicts the activities of German spies in the United States. This story is not fictional but is based on the confessions of Nazi spies in American courts, exposing Germany's international conspiracies. It also mentions the Nazi Party's abuse of Jews, expressing sympathy for Jewish refugees. Therefore, after it was filmed, film critics generally believed that not only should every American watch it, but people in democratic countries all over the world should also watch this film.</p>
<p>Filming Process</p>
<p>Warner took a year to film "Confessions of a Nazi Spy." The handling of this film was particularly cautious. At the same time, to take into account American foreign policy, it could not be emphasized too strongly. During filming, the studio was under strict security, and irrelevant people were not allowed to enter or leave. Even news reporters were not allowed to visit. Many actors did not even know the details of the story until all the work was completed. It is conceivable how strict Warner's precautions were.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Meng Xiaodong and Zhang Eyun Arrive in Hong Kong Together <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Xing</p>
<p>The famous Kunqu opera singers Meng Xiaodong and Zhang Eyun have arrived in Hong Kong together. Rui Qingrong, the owner of the Shanghai Xinguang Theater who is staying in Hong Kong, plans to invite the two singers to perform at the Lee Theatre, but they are still considering. It is found that the Hong Kong troupe is too bad, and the performance of Peking opera in the past has not been good, so the performance may not be possible. Meng Xiaodong is Mei Lanfang's ex-wife, and they may be able to meet in Hong Kong this time.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Ms. Wu Leyi's Solo Concert <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Wu Leyi is one of Shanghai's leading piano experts. She has been gifted since childhood, and whenever she performs, she is admired by the audience. On April 7, Ms. Wu performed famous piano pieces at the Shanghai Lyceum Theatre Municipal Council String Orchestra concert, which was praised by many. This time, it is scheduled to hold a solo concert at the Lyceum Theatre again on the evening of May 3 (Friday). The program includes Western masterpieces, and Mr. Xu Mianqing will assist in singing. The proceeds from the tickets, after expenses, will all be donated to the Shanghai Christian Poor and Sick Relief Center. Listening to music and helping the poor and sick can be said to be a double benefit.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Composer of "Flying Phoenix" Rudolf Film Leaves Shanghai for the Philippines <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Wangshu</p>
<p>The famous composer and piano virtuoso Rudolf Film boarded the President Coolidge yesterday, making only a one-day stopover in Shanghai before continuing on the original ship to the Philippines and Bali. Film collected materials in the above two places and included them in his new work "World Tour Harmony." Film said that the world-famous music conductor Leopold Stokowski will serve as the music conductor when this new harmony is completed. A major Hollywood film company has also prepared to sign a contract with him to purchase the filming rights to this piece.</p>
<p>Film had visited Shanghai several times years ago. During his travels around the world, he photographed famous city scenery to serve as the musical theme when composing the new harmony. Although Film must leave Shanghai today, he will return soon because he wants to experience the opposite musical theories here and incorporate the adoptable elements of Eastern music into his new work to enhance the local flavor of the new harmony. Film has traveled to Madrid, Vienna, and Annam, and this trip will also traverse famous cities in the Far East.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Yan Shishan's Trip Was Worth It <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Dai Yun</p>
<p>Although Yan Shishan's treatment this time in the south was not particularly good and the repertoire was still arranged too early, her popularity and strong reputation surpassed even the top two famous actors, who paled in comparison. The critics unanimously praised her. The number of music lovers in the audience who praised and enthusiastically supported her was especially large. On the 26th of this month, the Shanghai Bank Club and Fengshe, two major ticket offices, greatly admired Shishan's art and wanted to reward and encourage her. They specially reserved two or three hundred seats at the Xinguang Theater and asked her to re-perform her most popular play, Yang Paifeng. That night, on the side of Niuzhuang Road, the traffic was heavy, and the road was almost blocked. Elegant figures and officials gathered, all aiming to appreciate this special and wonderful play. The scene was unprecedented, and the high-ranking guests were mostly there for Shishan. The theater seemed to understand the intention of the music lovers and specially moved Shishan's performance to the end, which allowed Shishan to breathe a sigh of relief!</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Wang is most impressed by Shishan's performance. Mr. Wang is a famous amateur Peking opera singer in Shanghai. When Shishan came south, she was introduced to Mr. Wang by a friend. Mr. Wang saw that her skills were excellent and her behavior was dignified without the habits of a performer, so he greatly appreciated her. His intention was to appreciate art and support talent, not just to befriend someone.</p>
<p>It is also heard that Yan Shishan's contract at the Xinguang Theater will expire soon and she will return north. The two ticket offices will reserve seats again for the last three days of her farewell performance. Shishan is now returning with honor, leaving an excellent impression on the people of Shanghai, which can be said to be a worthwhile trip.</p>
<h3 id="e127">"Chinese Snow White" <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>Director Wu Yonggang told reporters yesterday that the script for his new film "Chinese Snow White" has been completed. The outline of the story uses the stepmother to symbolize dark forces, and the seven dwarfs to represent the masses. Although it is still a fairy tale, it is more subtle. The characters are assigned as follows: Chen Juanjuan as Snow White, Han Langen as the Little Mute, Yin Xiucen as Shy, Tang Jie as Old Stubborn, Zhang Zhizhi as Sneezy, Hong Ling as Old Doctor, Ge Furong as Sleepy, and the role of Happy has not yet been decided. The cruel stepmother is planned to be played by Yan Fei, who won the praise of "End of the Ming Dynasty". He said that many places will use the exaggerated techniques of cartoons. For example, a sneeze will shake the doors and windows, and the smile on the photos on the wall will immediately turn into anger when they see hateful characters. Wu Yonggang intends to make it a fairy tale that is not only interesting but also meaningful.</p>
<h3 id="e128">An Xiulu and Dan Xiang: She actually has become such a charming girl, don't let it be a dream. But her "charm" is definitely "real." <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<h3 id="e129">First Look at the Yindu Ice Skating Rink <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— Chao Yan</p>
<p>The Yindu Artificial Ice Skating Rink is scheduled to open today. The night before, reporters were invited to visit and see this artificial ice trick. As soon as we entered the door, we saw that the layout of the venue was quite exquisite, and the equipment was quite new. There was an air conditioner and ventilation fan installed overhead. Around the perimeter were seats for guests, enough to accommodate two or three hundred guests. A curtain hung in front, and in the center of the skating rink was a grayish-white crystalline floor. Manager Luo and engineer Ge greeted us. Engineer Ge also pointed out that he had been studying artificial ice for two years, and today he finally succeeded. We stepped into the skating rink to admire it. The ice is a kind of chemical crystal. It is darker than marble, and slightly powdered with debris when heavily trampled. We peeled off a piece and put it in our hands. It was like pear paste candy. It is said that the area here is forty square feet, the ice weighs 30,000 pounds, and it is more than two inches thick. Special knife-shaped skates are prepared, which can rotate freely on this artificial ice without any noise. We wandered around, looking at the flashing red and green lights at the entrance, and touching the ice debris under our feet, we felt strangely warm in our hearts.</p>
<p>Engineer Ge also said, "This ice is the most mysterious. Skating on it, you can teach heroes to use their skills, but it's not too slippery..." We nodded in agreement. They also showed us many photos of the venue, which looked even more magnificent.</p>
<p>We stepped onto the walkway and leaned on the soft chairs. A foreign Miss began to perform in the skating rink. The waltz steps seemed to be very skilled, and a gentleman next to her cooperated with her.</p>
<p>The air in the venue was quiet, and they talked and talked to us.</p>
<p>I thought: In twenty-odd hours, this place will definitely be crowded with people, won't it? Lin Kanghou and Yuan Lvdeng are about to come to preside over the opening, and there will be Yuan Meiyun, Chen Yanyan, Tong Yuejuan, Gu Lanjun, Li Minghui, and a garden of brilliant cutouts, guest performances by Chinese and Western skating masters...</p>
<p>Engineer Ge explained it to us again, drawing a triangle on the paper, just to show that skating shoes would be too slippery on glass, and the rotation on this artificial ice would be just right.</p>
<p>We looked at the foreign Miss again from afar, and she did another somersault.</p>
<p>The ventilation fan hissed on the wall. We rested and strolled around again, and then said goodbye and left.</p>
