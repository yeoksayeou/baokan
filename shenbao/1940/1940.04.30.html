<h3 id="c11">歐戰中的商戰 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>歐戰向挪威方面蔓延之後；在軍事上，是各交戰國大規模戰爭的開展；在軍備上，是各中立國高速度擴軍的競爭；在經濟上，則公閉或隱秘，直接或間接，從事於封鎖反封鎖，從事於合作與排擠，從事於內在的強化生產，外向的爭取物料，爭取市塲，形成最尖銳的商戰；參加這商戰的，卻却小分為交戰國或為中立國，國際之林，絕無例外。以商戰傷而論，大體亦以軍事陣地為中心；槃旋於中心，由近及遠；故最初是歐洲中立的各小國，繼之及於近東，南徉，遠東，以及於拉丁美洲。這是任何國家生命與養命的源泉，亦是整個國際的矛盾。矛盾所在，祗能期望中立國家彼此並行不悖於和平空氣之下；雖不免於彼此磨擦，抑亦無法使矛盾根本的消弭。</p>
<p>各交戰國的商戰，主要塲面是英法兩國對於德國的封鎖；亦即以使任何中立國對德絕對斷絕商業關係為最高最後的目標。原來德國在戰前是工商業很發達的國家；以德國對外貿易的輸入而論，在一九三八年，德國對英的輸入是二八二，七（單位百萬馬克）；對阿根廷是二一六，一；對美是四〇四，六；對瑞典是二六一，七；對義國是二四五，七；對荷蘭是一九七，九；對比利時是一九四?四；對巴西是二一四，四；對丹麥是一六六·三；對法國是一四三·七；對羅馬尼亞是一四〇四；總之，為數甚鉅。及至戰時，英法對於歐洲許多中立國家之在德國勢力範圍的，雖不能禁止其對德貿易關係，可是他們一方面用封鎖的方法，使這些國家確認英法的意態，一方面却用貿易政策使這些國家沒有多餘的物料賣給德國。許多中立國家，雖對於交戰國的雙方，至少在貿賣上必求其一視同仁，無分軒輊，但因海上封鎖的壓力，經濟上的必需，以及商業交易的基本原則與性質上，以前獲之於德國者，現在事實上不能不轉而交易之於英法，亦即無形中不能不接受英法方面的限制。因此之故，歐洲中立國的市塲，大禮因英法的政策而為英法所控制。</p>
<p>英法這樣的政策，不獨行之歐洲，即在大西洋彼岸的拉丁美洲亦為英國的主要對象。英國海外貿易大臣赫德生曾宣言英國準備考量其對於拉丁美洲的輪出量，不加以限制；質言之，英國準備在拉丁美洲竭力推廣貿易。原來英國對於這一方面，亦自有其兩種主要的武器，一是貶價的貨驚，一是英國為購買而用之於拉丁美洲的金鎊，因勢利導的為推銷英國商品，開闢了坦途。即如在阿根廷與烏拉圭，英國原有貿易上的優勢，所以英國學持必須用貿易來撈回他百分之九十五的購買所費去的金額。在智利，英國對於羊毛的購買，則想用互惠的商業協定，以達到貿易令衡的目的。對於購買巴西的罐頭肉類，也想以同一方式行之。我們若祇從英國的觀點來說，不能不承認英國政策的高明；州從另一親點說來，最受英國政策影響的，自然是美以對於拉丁尖洲各國的商業利益；二者之問，確成高皮的矛盾。美國在二次大戰爆發之初，滿以為這次大戰中也像上次一樣，不獨軍需工業，可以戛憂獨造，大利盈溢；並且可以使於拉丁美洲各國方面的英貨市塲，自然歸於衰退消減；美國得由政冶上的門羅主義，進而形成經濟上的門羅主義。但事實却並不如美國人想像的那般圓滿。美國對拉丁美洲的輪出，雖由前年十一月份的二千三百萬元，增至上年十一月份的三千三百萬元，但英國並沒有放棄他的對南美的商業進攻，并且還在繼續努力之中。</p>
<p>但英法對美國，不容見利忘義而祗謀片面的商業利益的，他們畢竟對美國是有所依賴的；在作戰需要美國軍火經濟的援助，畢竟此任何利益為軍要。是以英國經濟戰爭部顧問郭德慶，及法國經濟專家即法蘭西銀行前任副總裁李斯德於三月初的赴美，就旱想解決英美間的經濟封鎖及商業絞爭上的種種矛盾。英法方面發言人謂此行的使命，是在（一）使英法兩國封鎖政策運用可以避免各中立國遭受影響，（二）聽取美國力面所提出的建議，同時並將戰爭所起的各項問題，覓致解決。這裏所說的中立國，自然以美國為主體。美國對於英法的建議，必然為英法所不能不重視。據日昨所得消息，謂英法專使與美國政肘的談判，雙方業。已各作相當讓步，並稱「英決與美國之問的戰時貿易，不致有甚大的摩擦。」這樣寥寥的幾句話，一方面流露了美國與英法之間的諒解與友愛，一方面暴露了英法與美國經濟對立態棋的存在。原來中立國與交戰國問的經濟利益，正如在對壘國家間的戰爭一樣，很可能發生對立的磨擦，尖銳的矛盾，每每不是憑了幾度外交談判，就可以獲得圓滿解決。解決之道，在技術上固有其無數的方法、在政治上亦有各種程度的折衷方法；但我們亦不能忽視政治方法上的兩個極端：其一，由各不相讓而引起戰爭：其二，由化合於同一戰綫而成為其通利害。當然，吾們不希望其趨於任何一極端，日英法美之問決不趨於第一極端；但是究竟如何程度的相讓而折衷，這是極可往意，且是對於戰爭全局，有其微妙而宏遠的影響！</p>

<p>今日爲唯一之總結束期、到期之款及新放之款、而其奔走接洽之時期、亦惟是日是賴、聞四底成交之款、總的二三千萬元、以國貨事業之工廠行號、以及客幫老戶糖北貨行爲最多、長期息自八釐至一分半不等、至於銀錢兩業之收解、因四底關係特別繁忙、各莊劉內均延長時間辦理結算、銀行票據交換所、票據交換額激增、</p>
<p>金融穩定　各業安渡</p>
<p>上海之金融、自經中中交農四行之拆放、及銀錢業準備會庫倉調劑、與各莊之增加準備、新滙劃實施收效、所以市塲依然穩定、惟因投機之風太盛、不得小提高利率設法防止、故市塲銀根表面上甚緊、實際上游資依然充斥、金融情形與戰前大小相同、行莊倒閉情事、絕無發生、並因滬市之畸形發展、各業均獲厚利、四底之安渡、決無問題、</p>

<p>工部局弦樂隊指揮梅百器（Maestro　Maico　Paci）氏，昨天下午，對往訪的新聞記者道：「我希望報界能予我們以贊助，使上海愛好音樂的仕女們，在聆得這次俄國大作曲家查科夫斯基（P．J．Tschaikovsky）百年誕辰紀念音樂奏演之後，對於舞曲—Ballet發生興趣」。</p>
<p>梅先生講得高興的時候，揮手舉臂，句句有勁，字字嘹亮，叫人想像起他在音樂台上，抑揚頓挫，快慢疾徐，那一副指揮時的情狀。</p>
<p>他說，在五月中，世界各地將舉行紀念這位大作曲家的百年初度。工部局絃樂隊打算在五月下旬舉行「查科夫斯基音樂祝典，」來紀念這位不朽的俄國昔樂大師。日期一共三天，—廿一·廿四·廿六—奏演查氏的各種傑作。第一晚是室內音樂，有俄籍音樂師參加；第二晚舞曲，第三晚交響樂。時間都在晚上九時一刻，地點大的是蘭心，在奏演前幾天，另有廣告公佈。</p>
<p>「滿座…滿座，」梅樂師說，「我要使這三晚都滿座，」他說到這裏格外興奮起來，手頻頻在桌子上拍着。他的意思，票子是三塲連用的，早日預售；只用一塲的，將在臨奏演前幾天才有買，價錢也貴得多了。</p>
<p>在這一次查科夫期基百年紀念音樂週中，最具有興趣的，將爲第二晚—就是廿四日星期五—的舞曲，曲「天鵝湖」。由梅氏領導工部局弦樂隊奏樂，俄人舞曲團表演，弦樂隊與舞曲團的合作這是初次，預料在這「二難並」的情况之下，成績「定十分美具」。</p>
<p>「天鵝湖」這支舞樂曲，是查氏一八七六年間的成熟作品。他於一八七七年作歌劇“Eugen　Onegin”—此劇故事，原爲普希金所作，一八七九年三月間，查氏以其樂曲公演於莫斯科的音樂館，獲得莫大成功。所以「天鵝湖」也可說是查科夫斯與他歌劇傑作同垂不朽的大作品。</p>
<p>俄人舞曲團台柱天才藝術家金女士，將担任要角天鵝公主。並已邀請史魯斯基氏指揮工部局弦樂隊的。主持這次舞曲團表演的爲索可斯基和希夫勒金二氏。梅氏並一稱室內音樂奏演時，也有三位俄國音樂家參加，其中一位是靑年鋼琴名手石克哈諾夫，其其才能很為梅氏所推重。</p>
<p>查科夫斯基生於一八四〇年五月七日，誕生地為伏金斯克，又親是一位礦學工稈師。查氏初學法律，又曾在司法部供職，可是他具有音樂天才，常以愛美音樂家姿態出演，爲人擊節稱賞。呆板板的法律，當然非他所喜。嗣後入聖彼得堡音樂館肄業，爲館長大音樂家羅皮斯汀氏所識拔，查氏從此便以音樂家終其生。</p>
<p>查氏生平曾作交響樂曲兩支，都是膾炙人口之作，其他舞曲，歌劇等亦都風靡一時，但是最著名的傑作，還是成功於一八七六年之後。一八九三年他完成Pathetie一曲，國外人士傾倒備至。這一年他在劍橋指揮他目己的作品，而獲得名譽音樂博十學位。但是，可惜得很，十一月六日，這位名重一時的大音樂家，竟染霍亂病死於聖彼得堡，享年五十三歲。</p>
<p>大藝術家的身世，往往令人喟然！這位查科夫斯基氏一生，雖也有過羅曼斯，受知於紅粉佳人和士大夫之流。低是坎坷之來，似乎他無從抵抗，人，本來是受命運支配的。他結婚過，但不久就和夫人仳離；又在聖彼得堡因病企圖自殺，幸而未遂，吾則百年之後的今日，那里會在異國的上海，有人爲他憑弔紀念呢！</p>

<p>昨日米市當晨至午、一路平平、無甚變化、賣方因序米產地劃價尙雜相合、未顧輕脫、買方以週前市面既遭挫折、復恐記暴風、客鑰非廉不辦、似呈相待之狀、僅浮厘做戶回藝貨頗多授受、所以結果全市銷塲牛常、收盤行悄與前相仿也、</p>
<p>粳需國米、兩朝合計共到錫常青泗及蘇嘉路－帶之貨不下三四千包、銷塲糯不若粳、則以糯米價格近來一度回昂、已鮮大戶屋收僅－些糕舖飯擔去路、故售價較戰、除身骨擊潤之真特貨以市上缺乏尚見挺立外、質弱潮柔者、則已略短三五角、其粳米則自－路貶低、殊校洋米便宜、深受一般吃戶歡迎、因是門市頓旺、店家為謀應付計、遂專所採購、市上依限開出不鮮外、日聞塲外暗盤、亦複不弱、開特別清坯鍋粳四十五元、大市四十四元左右、粉坯四十三元、崑常梗四十三四元、青泗特薄四十四尤、大市四十三元、四十二元半、南港原包早晚稻四十二元半至四十一元半、而久已乏貨之枉尖、亦有做開、為四十二元半四十二元云云</p>
<p>洋米邇日被眼根奇緊之壓力影響、市乃稍起即落、久難振作、昨日雖有日商與行號鄕回舖作趁小吸收、終以浮多散戶紛紛求駝、市價依然驚小二三四角、回籠期貨四五月份二號西貢因時閒逼近、大半付裝在途、前聞五十三元半之貨品昨竟以即交跡貨豈開五十二元、十大半月之路期貨喊五十二元四元角亦乏對手、統市現洋米開六千包、原包回籠貨開三百多噸、中日商及散囤辦進云、</p>

<p>麪粉昨二號紛廠盤、由十三元八角降至十三元五角、較前改低三角、蓋以邇來內地雜牌粉運滬傾銷、本街零批交易日減、廠方為維持性質、故將廠槃自動減低、以挽漏卮、聞回龍貨老車牌上午一度開道十三元七角、內地紛　屬脾價關十三元二角、但午後因悉廠聲降落、雖廉亦乏受主、紋市各紛成交併計一萬餘包、悉由本街及內地鄉莊辦去、客紹則餃然沉辭</p>

<p>我們試看看天然界，小東西的能力眞是偉大呵！小草不微小嗎？然而因爲有上帝的能力幫助牠的緣故，久而久之，牠欲從盤石底下生長出來。水不軟弱嗎？小孩子能夠用指頭隨意把牠彈開，然而因爲有上帝的能力幫助牠幾千噸的鐵船，戴在牠身上，却牠毫不費力，如負浮萍一般。空氣不是最輕的嗎？然而因爲有上帝的能力幫助牠，牠的能力足以推樹倒　，所以我們萬不可輕看了小事，我們本是極軟弱極無能力的，但是上帝能使我們有能力，如他使那些軟弱的東西有能力一般，所以我們不要看自己不能做事，我們本人固然不能，但我們靠着，加給我們力量的上帝我們便覺萬事都能作。某海口有一次被人投下了一塊大石頭，許多年以後，因這石頭的攔阻而淤積在此地的泥沙日見增多，到後來竟變成了一個小小的海島，諸位看，一個小石頭竟有如此偉大的能力！保羅說，「那時我軟弱，以後我卻剛強，」這話實在眞理，因爲自己靠着自己的聰明能力，決抵當不過魔鬼的能力，我們須要知道自己的軟弱，知道自己不能勝過世俗，情慾，和魔鬼的誘惑，以後轉面向上帝，誠心禱求他的能力，我們才可剛強。總而言之，我們應當常常記着於小事上忠心，於小事上謹愼，常常知道自己的軟弱，常常求上帝賜給我們的能力，然後我們才可剛強，上帝才會把大事給我們管理。　（完）　欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3 id="c112">科學家與昆蟲作戰 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 藍垀</p>
<p>天氣漸熱，昆蟲活躍的時期又到了。昆蟲之繁殖力實足驚人；以最普通的蒼蠅來說：一隻蒼蠅能生產四次，每次所產卵子在一顆與二百顆之間，自春至秋約可生產十代，以每隻產卵四百計，一年之間，每隻蒼蠅可以繁殖到無數萬萬。</p>
<p>奇特現象</p>
<p>或曰：「昆蟲之繁殖如是之快，決非人類之力量所能撲滅，長此以往，昆蟲豈非要充滿全世界嗎？但自地球上有生物以來，已經過數千萬年，何以各種昆蟲之數量，並不見其增加？」</p>
<p>的確，這是一個奇特的現象，據昆蟲學家研究的結果，以爲每一種昆蟲，都有一種寄生蟲寄生在其身上，吸收昆蟲體內養料，並排泄毒素，昆蟲往往因此死之。在夏季你可以發現很多昆蟲的屍體，堆積在角落裏或窗檻上；這些屍體便是那微小寄生蟲工作的成績。</p>
<p>昆蟲軍隊</p>
<p>最近，人類已應用了這種原理與疫癘荒歉相抵抗，一切傳染疫病與傷害植物之昆蟲皆爲人類作戰之對象。美國有專門養育各種昆蟲身上的寄生蟲之工塲，實行大量生產制度，以便與昆蟲相搏鬭。大家知道美國現有近一　萬之摩托化常備軍，但很少人知道美國現正有一百萬萬的昆蟲常備　與昆蟲在作戰呢！</p>
<p>但昆蟲也有牠們繁殖的方法，牠們可以趁商　到數千里以外的地方去，那兒沒有牠們的死仇——寄生蟲，牠們可以自由地繁殖着，在短時間中造成嚴重的災害。然而科學家們亦決會不容昆蟲長此猖獗下去。科學家常組成一個團體，出發到數千哩外的深山密林中，尋覓寶貴的寄生蟲。</p>
<p>萬里長征</p>
<p>有一次美國西部發生蟲災，幾百方哩的麥，都給某種昆蟲吃光了。科學家就開始研究關於這種蟲類的種種，他們發現其繁殖的原因是因尚無寄生蟲來阻止其繁殖，於是他們就得出動去尋覓其老巢。尋覓的結果，知道是從奧大利亞傳佈過來的。於是他們就組織一個尋訪團到澳洲去尋覓寄生蟲。這工作也是相當困難，因寄生蟲非人眼所能看見，所以祇好捕捉該昆蟲而取其體內之寄生蟲。但昆蟲之老巢中寄生蟲繁多，昆蟲反不易繁殖，故尋覓亦非容易，常常走過數百方哩而猶找不到。而且其地常多叢林沼澤，氣候惡劣，水土不服之科學家常因此而生病。</p>
<p>驚險萬分</p>
<p>記得有一次一隊科學家在非洲採集寄生蟲時，突過大隊象羣迎面衝來，團員避讓不及，致有不少工具爲其毀傷；更有一次一隻獅子在夜間偷偷地爬進營帳，團員發槍射擊，不料却因此激怒獅子，咆哮蹝跳，營內什物，爲其毀壞無遺，帳幕幾乎爲其傾覆，許多科學家亦因此而受傷。當朋友問他們爲什麼會受傷的時候，他們常愛這樣回答：「還不是爲了這些小東西嗎？」</p>
<p>這些小東西帶到美國以後，最初須由科學家與醫生檢騐，假使發現這種蟲類於人身有害，就得把牠們全部毒死，檢騐無毒方許培養。養育之室與養花暖房差不多，上通陽光，用玻璃造成，門外有一黑暗甬道；中有一燈，開門時其燈自熄，蟲性向光，故不願飛出，蓋所以防其奪門而出也。此後復分養於溫度與潮濕不同之各種房間中，以覘其在何種情形下繁殖最快，以後即以此種情形爲標準，實行大量生產。</p>

<p>— 矅生</p>
<p>誰都知道，讀書的目的，決不是光光爲充實腦袋，而是要把所得的知識應用於日常事務，「學以致用」，已成爲千古顚撲不破的良言了。</p>
<p>雖然「致用」是我們讀書的最終目標，但空想着我要學些實用的東西，對於讀書效能是毫無裨益的。學問的範圍是最廣大沒有了，假使東拉西抓，毫無計劃地看書，其結果時常對於任何書籍都感到缺乏興趣，以致一無所得。</p>
<p>因此在讀書時，我們需要一個範圍比較小而切實的目標，例如讀歷史，我們可以預備在讀畢後當故事樣講給孩子們聽，讀文學詩詞，便可以當歌曲唱熟了與友人對咏，讀心理學，就可以練習如何增進記憶力，讀電學，就可計劃造一架收音機。有了這樣一種與日常生活密切關聯的具體目標，讀者會覺得求知底迫切需要，因此而發生興趣，而知所選擇，而收到實際效果。</p>
<p>青年人往往認讀書爲苦事，舊式的教育，用責罰來使他們與書本太接近，效果究竟是暫時的。若使學者爲着某種具體的目標而讀書，那他爲了解決目前問題起見，便會津津有味地專心研究，非但不致缺乏興趣，並且爲要達到他的目標，一定很有恒心。</p>
<p>爲學要似金字塔，要廣博，但更要精深。在廣博中精深，這是一件難事，具體的目標便會幫助我們解決這困難。一本書決不會從頭至尾每一個字都有價值，況且價值的評定是隨人而異的，假如我們讀書沒有目標，那看完一本書後，祗覺得處處平凡，提不出精華來。惟有在定了一個具體的目標後，我們才能分別得出何者是我所屬意，何者對我是無價值的，這樣把現成的材料取捨而有次序地歸納起來，方可以談應用。</p>
<p>除非學者有一個清楚的目標，否則讀書是不容易收到效果的。爲娛樂而閱讀得到的效果是娛樂，爲消遣而閱讀得到的效果是消遣，要解決某種問題或達到某種目的而讀書，其效果便是解決此問題或達到此目的。若信手拿本書來看幾個字，那誰敢斷定其效果呢？所以有了目標，方能有效果，目標是收到實際效果的橋樑；換言之，是「學以致用」的一種手段。</p>
<p>人生是學習的人生，讀書僅是人生學習的一個縮影。平常我們對於任何事物的觀察與研究，都是應有一個目標，其價值與讀書應有目標是毫無差別的。記着，養成常懷有特殊目標的習慣，目標是成功的橋樑</p>

<h3 id="c116">駱駝底夢 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— 悟心</p>
<p>幾幀關於駱駝的照片，那是前幾天有個友人從遠方寄來的，在我的腦海裏撩起了一個遠古的駱駝的夢跟美麗的鄉土。</p>
<p>當小的時候在故鄉，每個清晨跟黃昏，那駱駝鈴清脆的聲浪和軋軋的水車聲，很諧和地在我們屋子的四周唱着勞苦之歌；使人們聯想起那遼遠的沙漠裹的駱駝隊，在它們如山峰般的背子上脊着許多沈重的東西，趕上它們的路程。</p>
<p>那時候，我的祖父還健在。記得：在一個寒冷的冬夜，全家圍在火爐傍閑談。那烘烘的火光浸透了我們四周的墨黑之綱；反映着那老人家滿雕生活創痕的和藹臉孔，浮出一些自得跟　　的色彩。披着銀　　的　　嘴上　着旱烟　　一陣陣地噴出濃　的白烟，使　個人的視綫都有點糢糊。他　呑呑地嗄啞地說着，帶些教訓意味：</p>
<p>「麟兒，將來你長大了得像那駱駝一樣，」他沈重地咳嗽了幾聲，一面把旱烟管在火爐傍邊敲了一下。那灼爍的目光射着我的面孔，「它們能夠替人們背着那麼笨重的東西，越過那麼窵遠而干燥的沙漠，曠野，……不論在狂風和暴雨中，不覺得一點的痛苦跟沮喪；這就是你將來應有的「駱駝底精神」，現在你就要養成這種精神，將來才能夠負起那繁重的責任。不要偷懶。時間比金錢還寶貴。麟兒，你記着這些話吧，……」</p>
<p>每趟我看見了駱駝和銅鈴的響聲，祖父那慈愛的面孔跟這一長串熱誠的聲浪，鮮明地，像澎湃的狂濤一樣，一股股湧在我的腦海上，使我掀起了一陣子的戰慄，徬徨跟慚愧。然而，我又記起我還年青。不由地又鼓起了一股勇氣——前進啊。青年人應該像駱駝一般地馳騁在祖國烽火的原野上。</p>
<p>可是，荒無的「孤島」上駱駝太少了，部份青年人看不見駱駝，也聽不見銅鈴的清脆的音響，連把它們的影子也忘掉了。他們就過着平靜的生活，如池塘裏躺着的無波的死水。</p>
<p>夢啊，我有著駱駝底夢。</p>

<p>— 君美</p>
<p>戲劇至精彩處，演，與觀衆，其精神往往融感一片，同。化境，劇中人旣渾忘自我，覜衆亦靡有其他，舊劇伶人諺籍所謂「唱戲瘋子，看戲傻子」，蓋可象徵此一時間之台上台下，沆瀣一氣，於是戲劇之感應盡至，而戲劇之功效盡矣。</p>
<p>感應與胡調不同，第劇塲中眞正之感應，則頗不易得，而胡調之感應，苟稍稍涉之歌塲，俯拾即是；如劇中一採花賊强一女角脫衣，且欲令其一脫再脫，女角有難色，則飾採花賊者，忽向台下觀衆詢問「你們看脫不得？台下亦竟有多人爲之應聲曰「脫說脫」，又如描寫寡婦思春，輒作輾側不能成眠狀，台下觀衆遂有大聲呼喊「今夜睡不着啦」，而劇中人亦居然在台上報以浪聲曰：「你看我睡得着睡不着」！此種現象，其台上台下固亦融化一片矣，而其破壞劇塲空氣，與眞正感應之熱烈嚴肅，蓋小可同日而語，此則演員與觀衆，當同負其咎！</p>
<p>是知戲劇之與感應，常亦視演員與觀衆之文化程度爲準則，窮鄉僻壤，文化水準低落，如吾鄕往日演春台戲，唱截江奪斗，孫夫人與張飛之唱白，詢句俚俗，不忍卒聽，如張唱：「大駡」聲養漢精，夾着浪×那裏行」？孫夫人接唱：「聽一言來怒氣生，大駡三弟老龜孫，皆因我母身得病，因叫接我轉回程，孩子不帶不吃勁，你不該××胡亂云」！「罷罷罷來捨了罷！狠着心腸將你咬，將小鼈種交與了老龜孫」！此段絕妙好詞，爲全劇最精彩處，兩人皆有不少身段，唱做俱極賣力，觀衆遂未有不凝神屏氣，認爲無上佳奏者，居然台上台下，融化一片，使易以文雅之詞，其不口呆目瞪，如墮五里霧中者幾　！使我輩聞之，則有小掩面却走者乎？</p>
<p>今日滬上平劇院，雖已少有如前者之胡調現象，而劇本演昌之與覜衆程度扞格不入者，則正復不少，或則戲本身祇能迎合低級社會，　則觀衆無以認識戲劇使命，於是從而抑揚之，歪曲之，或則予以苛求，或則施以放任，而台上台下，遂鮮有眞正之感應者，喝采，鼓掌，噓噓倒好，雜然同作，可笑也矣！</p>
<h3 id="c119">陳雲裳「謠傳」始末記 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>關於陳雲裳「墮胎殞命」的謠傳，第二天海星社就發表新華宣傳部長龔之方的談話，這謠言已不攻自破了。當時本報欲求更詳盡的報道起見，特致電本報駐港記者，昨天已接得詳細回電；略謂謠傳的起因，是一張在香港出版的廣東報，於四月ｇ　日「憑人節」造了這樣一個謠言，但第二天即目動更正了。至於陳雲裳的來滬日期，因爲「風流皇后」的工作緊張，或許要延至下月五號左右了。</p>
<p>由於這謠言的發生，我想起香港電影界的情形來了，過去香港電影界是在一片色情恐怖的包圍之中。陳雲裳未來滬之前，也曾拍過那些色情電影，所以那張以黃色新聞聳聽讀者的廣東報，就我陳雲裳來開一下玩笑。不過，我記得「木蘭從軍」公映的時候，陳雲裳答譯報記者的訪問中曾說過以後要多拍一點有意義的電影，可是她兩次回香港，都在巨人的包銀下「趕戲」，這多少使港滬兩地的觀衆對陳雲裳發生了兩種不同的印象，如這次謠言的發生，那廣東報的惡作劇，果應負完全責任，但以後「趕戲」的時候，也該選擇一下劇本」才好。這不但對陳雲裳個人的希望，也同時對整個華南電影界的忠告。</p>
<p>方法去請托運動，實實在在是非常不正當的。你想考試委員有六七人之多，每人保荐六七人，一天之內就可以湊足男女各二十人之數，何必耗費如評廣告費去登報徵求？既經登報徵求，當然希望由這個社會裏拔選出一些眞材，來充實未來的電影園。我們每一位考試委員如果要對得住全數投考人，對得住委托我們考試的公司，對得住整個兒的電影圈，當然不能有一絲毫舞弊的心。所以用盡心機去請托運　，完全是自欺欺人的行爲。</p>
<p>正當的準備就是應徵者除履行直接投函報名手續之外，自己先給自己，點兒心理訓練</p>
<p>第一，先問自已是否已合標明的資格？據筆者個人的經騐，訓練六個月，任何學科都</p>

<p>第二，所謂犧牲色相」這句話在表演藝術中是有極深切的意義的。沒有犧牲的決心，　　　　由自在地運用你的身　　　　　　　　　的工具。旣經决心之後，首先必須戰勝的就是你從襁褓時起逐漸培養滋長的怕着的畏怯心理。這種心理在法庭上是極受法官歡迎的。但是在電影演員的考試室裏是絕對用不着的。乾脆一句話，你旣沒有犧牲色相的勇氣，你又何必來躭悮人家的實責光陰呢？</p>
<p>自己鼓勵自己勇往應試的心理訓練便是我所希望於應試者的正當準備。拆穿西洋鏡說一句吧，考試委員們在電話中含糊答應「不可能範圍內盡力幫忙」的話，整個兒是「荳腐」。千萬別信他！</p>

<p>Luoyang: Since the 24th, Japanese troops defeated by Chinese forces in the area north of Jincheng attempted to break through and retreat north on the 26th. That evening, they were intercepted by Chinese forces near Machun Town (west of Gaoping) and surrounded again. On that day, the Japanese troops were completely cut off from supplies and had no hope of escape. By the morning of the 27th, they had been annihilated in one fell swoop by Chinese forces. It is estimated that over 1,800 Japanese soldiers were killed, and countless military weapons and documents were seized, which are currently being inventoried. (29th dispatch)</p>
<p>Lingbao: After suffering a crushing defeat, Japanese troops in southeastern Shanxi Province quickly continued to reinforce their positions in an attempt to reverse the declining situation, resulting in extremely weak rear forces. On the evening of the 25th, a Chinese unit, acting with agility, seized the opportunity to advance on Linjin. The Japanese closed the city gates and defended desperately, but the morale of the Chinese army was high, and they immediately launched a fierce attack on the city, inflicting countless casualties on the Japanese. The fierce battle continued until dawn on the 26th, when a Chinese unit broke into the East Gate and engaged the Japanese in hand-to-hand combat, annihilating even more Japanese troops. In this battle, the Chinese seized countless weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies. (29th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: After capturing Yangcheng on the 25th, Chinese forces in southeastern Shanxi continued to intercept and annihilate Japanese troops retreating southeast in the area of Gecheng Town, Xianling, and Huangdaotou (all east of Yangcheng), pressing the Japanese into the southeastern area of Yangcheng, Zhoucun, Tianjingguan, and Dadao, inflicting a crushing defeat. Over 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese rear area was completely taken over by Chinese forces, and the Japanese troops, cut off from food and ammunition, fled towards Bo'ai. Chinese forces are closely pursuing the Japanese, advancing step by step. (29th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: A detachment of Japanese troops defeated by Chinese forces near Yangcheng in southeastern Shanxi has suffered heavy casualties due to continuous pursuit and annihilation by Chinese forces in recent days. On the evening of the 25th, the victorious Chinese army turned again to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in the area west of Xianlin Mountain (west of Fudian). After repeated hand-to-hand combat, the Japanese suffered heavy losses. In the fierce battle that lasted until the morning of the 26th, a Chinese unit launched a pincer attack from the Lianping to Yangpo line, nearly wiping out the Japanese. The remaining approximately 300-400 soldiers attempted to flee south again, and Chinese forces are currently encircling and annihilating them on all sides. In this battle, the Chinese seized 13 machine guns, over 210 rifles, and countless mules, horses, and supplies. (29th dispatch)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The war in northern Henan Province is becoming increasingly tense. Over a thousand Japanese troops from Xinxiang, with many cannons, reinforced Bo'ai on the 24th and then divided their forces to invade north from areas such as Sigou and Zhangpo (both northwest of Bo'ai), and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese forces near Changping. Japanese troops defeated by Chinese forces in Lingchuan arrived near Nanli (south of Jincheng) on the morning of the 26th, where they were met with a head-on attack by Chinese forces, suffering heavy casualties.

<h3 id="e11">Commercial Warfare in the European War <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Since the European war spread to Norway, militarily, it is the expansion of large-scale warfare among the belligerent countries; in terms of armaments, it is the high-speed expansion competition of armaments among the neutral countries; in economic terms, whether public or hidden, direct or indirect, engaging in blockade and anti-blockade, engaging in cooperation and exclusion, engaging in internal strengthening of production, external striving for materials and markets, forming the most acute commercial warfare; those who participate in this commercial warfare, without distinction, are belligerent countries or neutral countries, and there is no exception in the international community. In terms of commercial warfare injuries, it is generally centered on the military positions; hovering around the center, from near to far; therefore, initially it is the small European neutral countries, followed by the Near East, the South Pacific, the Far East, and Latin America. This is the source of life and sustenance for any country, and it is also the contradiction of the entire international community. Where the contradiction lies, it can only be hoped that neutral countries will proceed in parallel with each other under the atmosphere of peace; although inevitable mutual friction, it is also impossible to fundamentally eliminate the contradiction.</p>
<p>The main battlefield of the commercial warfare of the belligerent countries is the blockade of Germany by Britain and France; that is, to make any neutral country absolutely cut off commercial relations with Germany as the highest and final goal. Originally, Germany was a very developed country in industry and commerce before the war; in terms of Germany's foreign trade imports, in 1938, Germany's imports from Britain were 282.7 (unit: million marks); from Argentina, 216.1; from the United States, 404.6; from Sweden, 261.7; from Italy, 245.7; from the Netherlands, 197.9; from Belgium, 194.4; from Brazil, 214.4; from Denmark, 166.3; from France, 143.7; from Romania, 140.4; in short, the amount was very large. When the war came, Britain and France could not prohibit the trade relations of many European neutral countries in the German sphere of influence with Germany, but on the one hand, they used blockade methods to make these countries recognize the intentions of Britain and France, and on the other hand, they used trade policies to make these countries have no surplus materials to sell to Germany. Although many neutral countries must seek equal treatment in trade with both belligerent countries, without distinction, due to the pressure of maritime blockade, economic necessity, and the basic principles and nature of commercial transactions, what was previously obtained from Germany must now in fact be transferred to Britain and France, that is, invisibly, they cannot but accept the restrictions of Britain and France. Therefore, the market of European neutral countries is largely controlled by Britain and France due to the policies of Britain and France.</p>
<p>Britain and France's policies are not only implemented in Europe, but also in Latin America across the Atlantic, which is also the main target of Britain. The British Minister of Overseas Trade, Hudson, has declared that Britain is prepared to consider its exports to Latin America without restrictions; in other words, Britain is prepared to vigorously promote trade in Latin America. Originally, Britain also had two main weapons in this regard: one is devalued goods, and the other is the British pound used in Latin America for purchases, which paved the way for promoting British goods by taking advantage of the situation. For example, in Argentina and Uruguay, Britain originally had trade advantages, so Britain believed that it must use trade to recover 95% of the amount spent on purchases. In Chile, Britain wants to use reciprocal commercial agreements for wool purchases to achieve the goal of trade balance. For the purchase of canned meat from Brazil, the same method is also intended to be used. If we only look at it from the British point of view, we cannot but admit the ingenuity of British policy; from another point of view, the most affected by British policy is naturally the commercial interests of the United States in the countries of Latin America; the two are indeed forming a high-level contradiction. At the beginning of World War II, the United States was full of the belief that, as in the last war, not only the military industry could be self-sufficient and profitable, but also the British goods market in Latin American countries would naturally decline and diminish; the United States could proceed from the political Monroe Doctrine and form an economic Monroe Doctrine. But the reality was not as perfect as the Americans imagined. Although the United States' exports to Latin America increased from 23 million yuan in November of the previous year to 33 million yuan in November of the last year, Britain did not abandon its commercial offensive against South America, and is still continuing its efforts.</p>
<p>However, Britain and France cannot allow the United States to be ungrateful and only seek one-sided commercial interests, they are still dependent on the United States; the need for American military and economic assistance in combat is ultimately more important than any interest. Therefore, the adviser to the British Ministry of Economic Warfare, Goodeqing, and the French economic expert, that is, the former vice president of the Bank of France, Lister, went to the United States in early March to resolve the various contradictions in economic blockade and commercial competition between Britain and the United States. Spokespersons for Britain and France said that the mission of this trip was to (1) ensure that the implementation of the blockade policies of Britain and France can avoid affecting the neutral countries, (2) listen to the suggestions made by the United States, and at the same time seek solutions to the various problems caused by the war. The neutral country mentioned here is naturally mainly the United States. The suggestions of the United States to Britain and France must be valued by Britain and France. According to the news obtained yesterday, the negotiations between the special envoys of Britain and France and the American government have already made considerable concessions on both sides, and it is said that "the wartime trade between Britain and the United States will not have much friction." These few words reveal the understanding and friendship between the United States and Britain and France on the one hand, and expose the existence of the economic opposition chessboard between Britain and France and the United States on the other hand. Originally, the economic interests between neutral countries and belligerent countries, just like the war between opposing countries, are very likely to have conflicting friction and acute contradictions, which cannot be fully resolved by several diplomatic negotiations. The solution has countless methods in terms of technology, and there are various degrees of compromise in terms of politics; but we cannot ignore the two extremes in political methods: one is that war is caused by not giving way to each other; the other is that it is combined into the same front and becomes the mutual benefit. Of course, we do not want it to tend to any extreme, and the relationship between Britain, Japan, France, and the United States will never tend to the first extreme; but to what extent the concession and compromise is extremely noteworthy, and it has a subtle and far-reaching impact on the overall situation of the war!</p>

<h3 id="e14">Military Affairs Commission Announces One Week of War Situation <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: A spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that large-scale battles have been launched on the northern and southern battlefields in the past week. In Shanxi and Anhui provinces, the enemy's momentum has been checked. Under the fierce resistance of the Chinese forces, the Japanese have suffered millions of casualties, and many important towns and cities have been recaptured. Although the enemy besieged in Nanchang, Jiangxi has launched repeated counterattacks, they have not succeeded so far. In eastern Henan, Kaifeng was bravely captured by Chinese forces, killing thousands of Japanese, causing panic among the Japanese. The other battle situations are also under the control of the Chinese forces. The offensive attempts exaggerated and propagated by the Japanese have been defeated. The important battle situations are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Shanxi Province: The Japanese troops in southeastern Shanxi have gathered tens of thousands of troops and launched attacks from Changzhi, Changzi, Huguan, Fushan, Yicheng, and other places, attempting to seize the area on both sides of the Qinshui River to open up the traffic between the Baijin Highway and the Daoqing Railway. The Japanese forces advancing along the Baijin Highway and the areas on both sides of it towards Gaoping were attacked by Chinese forces in the area north of Gaoping, and the main force launched a fierce pincer attack on the Japanese rear. By the 25th, all the Japanese troops had been defeated, and they turned their attack eastward, responding to the Chinese forces in the northeast of Lingchuan, and seized Lingchuan by taking advantage of the victory. The Japanese rear road to Jincheng was completely cut off by the Chinese forces. The Japanese forces advancing southeast from Fushan and Yicheng were met by Chinese forces in the Zhangma and Nakamura area, and the battle was extremely fierce. By the 25th, most of the Japanese were annihilated, and a few surviving Japanese troops fled south desperately. The Chinese forces pursued with all their strength and recaptured Yangcheng on the evening of the same day. The Japanese troops were in complete disarray. At this moment, the Chinese armies are advancing rapidly, compressing the encirclement of the stubborn Japanese troops in the Jincheng and Boai area and intensifying the annihilation. In total, the actual number of Japanese casualties in recent days has been over 14,000, and the combat will has been completely lost. In the triangular area of southern Shanxi, since the important strongholds such as Maojindu have been recaptured by Chinese forces, they have continued to advance, pressing the remaining Japanese troops east of Zhangmao Avenue and killing them in all directions. The Japanese casualties have reached over 5,000, and they are now being intercepted into several sections by the Chinese forces and encircled and annihilated separately.</p>
<p>Anhui Province: The Japanese troops from Wuhu, Cizhi, Tongling, Guichi, and other places in southern Anhui launched a large-scale multi-pronged attack south. Chinese forces mobilized to meet the attack. Since the 25th, fierce battles have been launched near Nanling, Fanchang, Qingyang, and Baiyang Temple. The Chinese army was overwhelming, and fought bloodily until the morning of the 26th. The Japanese suffered extremely heavy casualties. The county seat of Nanling was often recaptured by Chinese forces, annihilating over 800 Japanese troops. Then, a large Chinese army bypassed the Japanese rear and directly approached Wuzhou. At this moment, they have advanced to the Wuhu, Linqiao, and Ding'an area, cutting off the rear of the attacking Japanese troops and completing the encirclement. The other routes are launching bloody battles.</p>
<p>Northern Jiangxi: Chinese forces in northern Jiangxi took advantage of the victory to continue to recapture many key points after defeating the Japanese forces in Fengxin and Jing'an. At this moment, the outer strongholds of Nanchang were completely under the control of the Chinese forces. In order to defend Nanchang to the death, the Japanese forces continued to reinforce from Jiujiang, launching a large-scale counter-offensive from the 24th in multiple directions towards Xiangtang, Xishan, and Wanshou Palace. Chinese forces fought bravely to meet the attack. In the fierce battles that lasted until the 26th, over 1,500 Japanese troops were killed, and bloody battles are still ongoing in the same place. At the same time, Chinese forces along the Nanchang-Xunyang line took advantage of the momentum to launch a fierce attack on Tujiapu, beheading countless Japanese troops. The Japanese rear road was controlled by Chinese forces, and the situation of the Japanese forces trapped in the isolated city of Nanchang was extremely shaky.</p>
<p>Eastern Henan: On the evening of the 22nd, the Yu Lai troops launched a fierce attack on Kaifeng with the momentum of a hurricane and lightning, first annihilating all the stubborn Japanese troops in the suburbs of the city. By dawn on the 23rd, they divided into three routes and broke into the city. After two days and one night of fierce street fighting, a total of over 1,000 Japanese troops were killed. Several Japanese gasoline depots, ammunition depots, and grain depots were burned down. Dozens of Japanese trucks and four tank vehicles were destroyed, and countless Japanese military supplies were seized. The Japanese losses reached over 10 million yuan. While the battle in the city was in full swing, another elite force of the Chinese troops took advantage of the victory and broke into Damazhuang, north of the city, and blew up the Bianxin Railway bridge, blocking Japanese reinforcements. The Japanese troops were panicked, and then launched counterattacks from Guide, Taikang, and other places. After a brave killing by the Chinese forces, over 1,000 Japanese troops were killed in the suburbs of the city. On the same day, a certain unit of the Chinese forces recaptured Huaiyang, killing over 1,000 Japanese troops. On the same day, a part of the Chinese forces attacking Zhuxian Town broke into the city from the south corner of the Zhaizilin, fighting fiercely until dawn on the 24th, and beheading many enemy troops. The Chinese follow-up troops are continuing to advance and closely annihilate the dying Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Southern Hubei: The Japanese troops in the Tongshan area of southern Zou, about 2,000 infantry and artillery, launched attacks in four routes on the area north of Gongshan from the 23rd. Chinese forces met the attack head-on, annihilating three of them entirely after two days and nights of fierce fighting. Another route was surrounded by the Chinese forces in Fuyou Town, south of Dazi Town, and failed to break through. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese troops reinforced with several thousand troops, launching a fierce attack, and over 800 were killed by Chinese forces. At this moment, the fierce battle is still continuing.</p>
<p>Northern Hunan: Japanese warships on the Dongting Lake surface have continued to intrude on the Luojiao area, and have been repeatedly hit hard by Chinese forces. Sixteen Japanese motorboats have been destroyed and four Japanese warships have been severely damaged. At this moment, the Chinese forces are still closely monitoring them. In addition, the Chinese forces in southern Hebei invaded Xingtai and burned down the entire Japanese automobile factory. The eastern section of the Jiangsu-North Anhui Railway recaptured Yangji Station, the Zhejiang West forces defeated the Japanese forces invading Si'an Town from Changxing, and the Guangxi South forces recovered the three strongholds of Jiulong, Niuduan, and Bancheng on the east side of Yongqin, and swept away the remaining Japanese troops west of Fangcheng to Dongxing, with significant achievements.

<h3 id="e17">Chairman Jiang兼 of Sichuan Province Urges Virtuous and Able Gentry to Take Office as Chiefs of Townships, Villages, and Baojia, Hoping They Will Participate in Local Self-Government in Accordance with Legal Regulations <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Chengdu. Chairman Jiang兼 believes that Sichuan Province's new county system has already begun implementation. Regarding local self-government at all levels of organization, he earnestly hopes that virtuous and able gentry in each county will take office as chiefs of townships, villages, and Baojia, to set an example for the people of the region. He specifically issued a telegram to urge the virtuous and able gentry of Sichuan Province to serve local self-government and take office as township, village, and Baojia chiefs, stating that "Zhongzheng (Jiang's courtesy name) has quietly observed the internal and external situation and believes that to save the country and build the nation, it is necessary to awaken compatriots and work together. Therefore, for the past ten years, establishing Baojia and implementing community education have been the focus of local politics, aiming to improve education, cultivate production, and establish the foundation of national moral education. Later, promoting the New Life Movement and the National Spiritual Mobilization aimed to reform bad customs and invigorate spirits, all with the clear intention of enlightening compatriots and enhancing their ability to participate in politics, guiding them onto the right path of national salvation, survival, nation-building, and self-strengthening. During my years of inspection, I have always issued appeals to the local gentry, encouraging them to take on local political, educational, and construction undertakings as leaders. My earnest expectations are based on sincerity. Last year, I personally drafted the outline for county-level organizations and issued it for implementation, stipulating that townships are the basic level for building local self-government, and Baojia are the cells for enriching township organization. Moreover, management, education, support, and hygiene are unified, with the heads of each level concurrently serving as the captain of the local militia and the school principal, in order to concentrate authority, facilitate responsibility, and ensure practical implementation. At every level of organization, public opinion is established and training is conducted, and detailed lists of matters to be handled are carefully drawn up, all in order to increase public strength and enrich people's livelihoods. All these plans are aimed at striving for the completion of democratic politics and relying on local virtuous and capable individuals to work together. This is not only a key plan to concentrate forces and thoroughly achieve victory in the war of resistance, but also a major plan for long-term peace and stability and the consolidation of national survival. Since Sichuan Province is the most important and is under my personal leadership, the various implementation experiences of the new county-level organization system have already been specified in detail and are being implemented uniformly throughout the province within three years. The plan estimates that the positions of township chiefs, the heads of civil administration, economic affairs, culture, health, and other departments in township offices, and the staff of Bao chiefs' offices will require a large number of people, more than 300,000, while the positions of Jia chiefs will require approximately 700,000. Since ancient times, the key to governance has been said to be 'politics arises from people'. Moreover, today's vast undertaking of democratic governance will be futile even with good intentions if local talents are lacking, and the law will be ineffective. Sichuan is the base for the War of Resistance and nation-building. If the new system fails to be implemented smoothly, its impact on the whole country will be significant. This is the greatest responsibility of our Sichuan compatriots and the only good opportunity to save the hometown and serve the nation. I sincerely hope you will deeply understand this purpose, work together, uphold the spirit of self-government and self-strengthening, and contribute to leading and encouraging others. All local gentry and virtuous individuals are expected to resolutely participate in the township, village, and Baojia undertakings of local self-government in accordance with legal regulations, either participating in training to take on various positions as leaders of townships, villages, and Baojia, or providing assistance to various business implementations in the local area. Although the duties may vary, the merit of serving the locality and serving the country is the same. At the same time, county magistrates and party cadres at all levels should know that in a village of ten households, there must be loyal and trustworthy individuals. They should especially humbly seek out, sincerely welcome, and respectfully treat the virtuous and capable elders of their local townships, earnestly persuading them to come out and take office, and giving them their full support. They should consider the public opinion, choose the good and follow it, trust and respect expertise, and ensure security. Do not be misled by frivolous accusations or confused by right and wrong. Select talents appropriately, assign them according to their abilities, and let them take on responsibilities without complaint, encouraging their sincerity and developing their potential. Uphold this purpose and never be lax. If sincerity is shown, it will be felt day by day, and people will naturally be drawn to participate in governance together. The great cause of nation-building will surely be achieved on schedule." (Telegram dated the 29th)</p>

However, after dark, the two Germans who returned to Beiping were prevented from leaving the city by the Chinese police, so their unfortunate companions were left in the hands of the bandits overnight. However, the other two were also released and returned to Beiping this morning. It is reported that a squad of Chinese military police engaged in a battle with the bandits near the Luohan Temple, where the kidnapping occurred. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>Paris. It was learned here yesterday that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has prevented two German submarines from using the island of Maralgar in the Spanish Balearic Islands as a base to attack French merchant ships traveling in the Mediterranean. French political newspapers claim that Mussolini is firmly opposed to the expansion of the European war to the Mediterranean region. Two German submarines docked at Maralgar Island two weeks before the outbreak of the European war and participated in exercises with the German fleet off the Spanish coast last summer. Mussolini advised the Spanish government to order the two submarines to leave Maralgar Island. The crew members were not detained, but half of them were replaced by Spanish sailors. The Spanish government explained that it could not detain the German sailors because it wanted to buy the two submarines. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Rome. Ansaldo, the editor-in-chief of "Telegraphic News" (the organ of Foreign Minister Ciano), recently delivered a broadcast speech, saying, "Our country cannot remain aloof from the current European war for long." Justice Minister Grandi and well-known political commentator Gitti have also made similar statements. The question before us is to prepare to obey all orders from the government. In short, we deeply hope that the German army can achieve victory in Norway and express our respect for the German soldiers who sacrificed for their country. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Moscow. The local newspapers commented on Italy's position in the Mediterranean and vehemently attacked the essays published by British writer Bywater, saying, "Bywater believes that the Allied powers' superior position in the Mediterranean is beyond doubt. Once war breaks out, they can blockade the Suez Canal and the Strait of Gibraltar, cutting off Italy's maritime communications. But in fact, although the Anglo-French navy is large, the Italian fleet cannot be ignored. Moreover, Italy has a strong air force. We should not underestimate Italy's fighting power in the Mediterranean. Although the Allied powers can blockade the Strait of Gibraltar, it cannot affect Italy's military position. Italy can cut off the communication lines of Britain and France, occupy Pantelleria Island, and lay mines between Sicily and Tunis, so that the Anglo-French fleet will be blockaded in the western Mediterranean.

<p>Rome. Famous Italian journalist Gaida published an article in "Italian Daily," commenting on the fourth German White Paper, stating, "The publication of this document by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop is of extreme importance. This document has proven in detail what we already know and understand: the Western European countries, disregarding the rights of neutral countries, have prepared to attack the northern European countries. Britain's laying of mines in Norwegian territorial waters on April 8 was an open beginning to the violation of Norwegian neutrality. In terms of international law, territorial waters should be in the same position as territory and airspace. If the Netherlands and Belgium were to shoot down aircraft of belligerent countries flying over their airspace, we could also expect Norway to fire on ships laying mines, but the Norwegian government only protested. This weak measure has constituted the prerequisite for German military and political action. If other countries can violate Norwegian neutrality to achieve war goals, then Germany can also consolidate its national defense in the same way. Britain and France attempted to occupy Norway to fill the loopholes in the blockade against Germany, and to expand the war, creating a new battlefield against Germany. After Britain and France began to implement a policy of encirclement against Germany in the spring of 1939, they sought other countries, creating a situation of expanding the war zone. After the outbreak of the European war, the Allied powers did their best to drag all countries into the vortex of war, and attempted to rely on the military power of foreign countries to conduct war within foreign territories, so as to reduce the destruction and damage suffered by their own people and territory. The Allied powers' coveting of northern Europe is the same as their conspiracy in the Balkans. The Allied powers attempted to use the parties and internal conflicts of various countries to achieve their goal of expanding the war zone. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>London. Since the outbreak of war on the Scandinavian Peninsula, the British Information Department has been publishing a war report in the Swedish capital. It was learned that the war report published yesterday has been banned by the Swedish authorities, because the report contained a speech by First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill when the rescued sailors of the British destroyer "Hardy" returned to London, and criticized the neutral declaration issued by Swedish Prime Minister Hansson. Diplomatic circles here said that the Swedish government's move was probably under German pressure. At a time when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop praised Sweden's attitude and declared respect for its neutrality, Sweden actually allowed that country to interfere in its internal affairs. In the view of the British government, it should lodge a strong protest with Sweden. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Sweden. Military circles in Norway are extremely concerned about the fighting on the front line of the city of Dombaas in the central part of the country. If the city were occupied by the Germans, the British troops in the direction of Andalsnes would no longer be able to use the railway line to maintain contact with the rear.

A Reuters special correspondent who departed with the Allied forces recently telegraphed from Trondheim that the Allied forces along the line north of Trondheim are currently deploying everything in a smooth and effective manner. Thousands of British and French troops have landed safely in South Soth and reached the battlefield around Stankar. He received official news that the Allied forces were forced to abandon the town of Stankar last week because the town was completely destroyed by incendiary bombs. The powerful British and French troops are now holding positions north of the town. He traveled 316 hours from the Swedish border in a horse-drawn snow car, passing through high mountains and frozen lakes, along a very dangerous road, and connecting the central part of Norway. He saw a German bomber forced to land in Lake Yinminghan. Three crew members, because the villagers were armed and hidden, surrendered to the villagers.

The Admiralty has issued a communiqué: "Our navy has laid mines in the two bays of northern Norway," from 66 degrees north latitude to Varo Island, which is 67 degrees 39 minutes north latitude and 12 degrees 20 minutes east longitude. In addition, the waterways northeast and south of Stan Kiel Island, i.e., the north of the Lofoten Islands, 69 degrees 10 minutes north latitude and 16 degrees 35 minutes east longitude, have also been mined. All ships navigating in the above-mentioned areas, without complying with the orders of the Norwegian Navy authorities in British-occupied areas, shall bear the risk themselves. Xiyue and the Lofoten Islands are both outside the port of Narvik. After the mines are laid, the German navy will not be able to enter the port of Narvik, and the German garrison in the port of Narvik will not be able to receive support.

<p>Somewhere in Norway – Foreign Minister Koht issued a lengthy statement to the press on the 27th of this month, refuting German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech. He stated that Ribbentrop had claimed that the Norwegian government was aware of and approved of British mining activities in its territorial waters, and that Germany therefore had sufficient reason to invade Norway. However, according to the facts, the British mining operation was completely unexpected by the Norwegian government, which immediately protested to Britain. I also reported on this matter to the Parliament on the day the government lodged its protest, and the government decided on the same day that if Britain did not remove these mines within a short period, it would order the Norwegian fleet to clear them. From this sequence of events, it can be seen that all the claims made by the German authorities are complete fabrications, their intention being simply to find a pretext for the German invasion of Norway. In fact, the British laid the mines on April 8th, and German warships entered Narvik, Norway's northernmost port, the evening of the next day, which shows that the German fleet must have been dispatched to Norwegian waters long before the British laid the mines; otherwise, it would not have been so swift. In short, Norway has not only never violated its obligations as a neutral nation, but its scrupulous adherence to those obligations has even displeased certain nations. Therefore, to say that our country has violated its neutrality, thereby giving others an excuse to invade our territory, is a complete fabrication and requires no refutation. (Havas News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Stockholm – Norwegian Speaker of Parliament and Chairman of the Norwegian Foreign Affairs Committee Hambro, when interviewed by a Taiwan public news agency reporter yesterday, denied German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's false claim that Norway had permitted Allied troops to land in Norway before the German invasion. "I have obtained solid evidence to the contrary. Germany had been planning to invade Norway in detail for months. If the Allies had indeed been preparing to land, our country would be in a better position today. If Allied intelligence had alerted our country when they learned of Germany's intentions, we would not be in such difficulty today. What we must acknowledge is that our embassy in Berlin had clear evidence that the German landing force had boarded ships a week before the invasion of Norway. According to embassy personnel, they had already received news that German troops were boarding ships in various German ports, but because they trusted others' promises, they initially did not expect the German troops to be heading to Norway. The Allies also knew of this conspiracy early on. If Britain and France had been willing to notify Norway in advance, we would not have been caught so unprepared. This failure of the Allies to notify the Norwegian government proves that the Allies regarded Norway as an absolutely neutral country and had not prepared to ally with it."

<p>Paris – Regarding the safety of Danube River shipping, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Romania have recently signed an agreement to jointly guarantee it. Recently, the Hungarian government proposed to the other signatory countries that Germany should jointly bear the responsibility for guaranteeing safety. French diplomatic circles have commented on this, saying that this plan was informally brought up in March of this year. By the 17th of this month, the four countries of Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria had signed a temporary agreement, at which time Hungary stated that it reserved the right to make further suggestions later. It is rumored that Germany is dissatisfied with this agreement and has incited Hungary to make new proposals. Although this claim has been denied by the Hungarian government, the fact that it has now made the proposal proves that German pressure has been successful. If the Hungarian proposal is implemented, German gunboats would be able to navigate the Danube all the way to the mouth of the river. Romania and Yugoslavia, upon learning this, immediately expressed their opposition. Their reason is that the countries of Southeast Europe all wish to strictly adhere to neutrality, and the Hungarian proposal is contrary to neutrality, fearing that other belligerent countries will also invoke this precedent and demand the same rights, which they are unwilling to agree to. Bulgaria has not yet submitted a response. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>Tokyo – An official responsible for the military's control of munitions industry profits recently explained that the main principle of this plan is to prevent a small number of manufacturers from obtaining monopoly profits and to allow more manufacturers to share in the profits. The control measures will not only apply to the three factories supervised by the military but will also be extended to all munitions industry factories and stores nationwide. However, it is technically impossible to control all small-scale merchants, so the military will limit itself to supervising larger stores. Commenting on this discussion, the newspapers said that the nation's war industry will be completely placed "under the control of the military." The first step is to appoint 250 accountants to audit the books of munitions factories across the country. Larger factories will have one accountant responsible for auditing each, while smaller factories will have one accountant auditing the books of several factories combined. These candidates must not only be proficient in accounting but also be loyal and reliable. In short, under the control of the military, no munitions factory can obtain excessive profits, and all manufacturers will be able to obtain equal profits. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3 id="e41">US Congress to Consider Embargo Against Japan Before Adjournment, Senate Follows Government Lead, No Possibility of New US-Japan Treaty <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Washington – It is entirely possible that the US Congress will consider an embargo on war materials against Japan before adjourning in June. The two embargo resolutions proposed by Senators Pittman and Schwellenbach have been submitted to the Review Board. The reason why no action has been taken on these two cases is that the Senate is waiting for the State Department to take the lead. Now the Senate's mood clearly indicates that if the State Department or the White House takes no action, the embargo resolutions will easily pass. According to a recent private survey, senators strongly support the embargo by a vote of 24 to 9, with 24 opposed, and the remaining 48 indicating that they are awaiting the State Department's action. If the State Department agrees to the embargo, they will follow the State Department's lead. Political figures believe that if the embargo resolution encounters no difficulties and is passed by the Senate, the House will also pass it. According to what has been learned, the State Department is keeping silent on this issue because Hull firmly believes that the most important bill he wants Congress to pass is the restoration of the reciprocal trade agreement procedure. Once this bill is safely passed, Hull can give greater public attention to the Far East. Schwellenbach stated in his opinion that if the State Department or the White House does not propose a bill on this matter before the adjournment, the Senate will also pass the embargo against Japan proposed by him, Pittman, or both of them jointly. From a diplomatic perspective, if the United States has clean hands, then the embargo is necessary, because under the Nine-Power Treaty, the United States was a guarantor of China, and in honor, the United States should stop Japan's aggression against China; otherwise, the United States itself is no different from being an accomplice in Japan's violation of this treaty. At the same time, according to what has been heard here, negotiations for a new treaty after the abolition of the US-Japan treaty are unlikely to be launched in the near future. The position of the US authorities is that as long as the state of affairs that forced the US to abolish the old treaty has not been eliminated, it is impossible to conclude another treaty. As for the state of affairs that would allow negotiations for a new treaty to begin, it will be created by Japan. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Washington – Washington Democratic Senator Schwellenbach announced last night that he is still continuing to work to pass the question of an embargo against Japan through Congress. Schwellenbach said, "The United States should maintain its position as a moral leader among all neutral countries in the world that oppose aggression and violations of international law. Therefore, I have always advocated that we should not continue to supply Japan with arms, which will destroy the policy of Chinese territorial and political integrity, in accordance with the current obligations of the Nine-Power Treaty." Schwellenbach also believes that the world's struggle is due to the failure of countries to maintain international obligations. Schwellenbach also pointed out that France was ultimately unable to monitor Germany after it was disarmed, so that it would not rearm, and Britain was ultimately unable to fulfill its promise to aid China when Japan seized Manchuria. Other countries are similarly disregarding international obligations, and therefore there is only one way to war. (United Press dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Sharp Decline in Arms Exports to Japan <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Washington – The annual report of the Washington Munitions Control Board states that US arms exports have increased eightfold in four years, making it a world arms depot. In 1936, US arms exports were only worth a little over $24 million. Since then, they have increased year by year: $46 million in 1937, $83 million in 1938, and then increased to $204,555,780 in 1939. The largest increase was in exports to France: $60,000 in 1937, $7 million in the following year, and $122,120,267 in 1939, because France purchased a large number of American aircraft last year. Over the past four years, arms exports to various parts of the British Empire have also increased annually. Britain increased from $50,000 in 1936 to more than $20 million in 1939, Australia increased from $600,000 in 1936 to $11,469,934 in 1939, and Canada also increased from $60,000 to $6 million. As for the numbers of exports to the Far East, moral sanctions against Japan have been quite effective. In 1937, Japan purchased about $2 million worth of US arms. In 1938, it increased to about $9 million, but in 1939, it sharply declined to $761,684. Chinese purchases remained stable, ranging from $5 million to $7 million each year for four years, totaling $27 million. The lowest number was $5,062,617 in 1939, but that was still more than six times greater than Japan's purchases that year. German purchases were extremely low last year, falling from just over $1 million in 1937 to $14,944 in 1939. Italian purchases were also small, only about $80,000 over the four years. Soviet purchases were still stable: less than $1 million in 1936, more than $2 million each in 1937 and 1938, but then decreased again to $4,000 in 1939. Among the countries around Germany that have increased their purchases of arms from the United States, Denmark purchased $50,000 in 1936, but only purchased $20,000 in 1939. The Netherlands increased from just over $2 million in 1938 to $5,737,885 in 1939. Norway purchased a small amount, but Sweden jumped from $151,000 in 1938 to $5,895,406 in 1939. Turkey was also a good customer of the United States, increasing from $151,114 in 1938 to $3,174,979 in 1939. The purchases described above have not all been shipped, but this is the number listed on the export licenses. At the same time, the United States also imported some arms, about $1 million in 1939. During the four years from 1936 to 1939, the United States imported a total of $1,787,122, most of which was purchased by arms factories and aircraft factories. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e43">US Senators Debate on Radio, Some Advocate Seizing British and Dutch Islands <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Washington – US senators recently participated in a radio debate. Senators Thomas and Schwellenbach warned the United States not to seize islands in the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean belonging to France or the Netherlands. Thomas said that unilateral action by the United States would destroy the Good Neighbor Policy and jeopardize the trust of small Latin American governments in the United States. The United States states that when talking about any changes in the status quo of any land in the Western Hemisphere, this change is not only related to the United States itself, but also related to the US's neighboring countries. Senators Reynolds and Lunden, on the other hand, advocated that Congress should approve a resolution stating that the President should act immediately to acquire strategic islands in the Western Hemisphere. Lunden said that for national defense purposes, the United States should seize Greenland and the British, French, and Dutch islands in the Caribbean Sea. Reynolds said that Cocos Island of Costa Rica and the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador must also be placed under the American flag in order to fully protect American interests.

<p>New York – Utah Democratic Senator King gave a speech here last night, fiercely criticizing National Socialism and Fascism. He said, "National Socialism wants to reduce mankind to slaves of modern tyrants, and to degrade modern civilization to its primitive state." The United States "will never turn a blind eye to the struggle made by various free peoples." "When the enemies of this civilization are using the name of neutrality to silence our mouths and fall into crisis, we should immediately declare to the world that there is no room for compromise with the principles of freedom and democracy. We must also expose the poison of official propaganda. Any joint action that undermines the independence of small countries and abolishes the rights that minorities should enjoy is an attack on the foundation of democratic governance and individual freedom."

<h3 id="e45">Overview of Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish Deposits in the US, US Treasury Department Issues Briefing <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Washington – The US Treasury Department publishes a monthly report on capital flows between the United States and other countries. Information on the Scandinavian Peninsula has always been summarized in the "Other European Countries" column. Since the outbreak of the war in Northern Europe, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau has temporarily served as the custodian of Norwegian and Danish assets. The current monthly report discloses an overview of the deposits in the United States by the three countries on the peninsula. According to its records, as of the end of January of this year, Denmark had short-term deposits of $28,703,000, Norway had $66,986,000, and Sweden had $163,385,000. According to estimates from the Department of Commerce, these three countries also have long-term deposits totaling $121.5 million, including $45 million for Sweden, $67 million for Norway, and $13 million for Denmark. After Germany invaded Norway and Denmark, President Roosevelt issued an order that all assets of the two countries in the United States were not allowed to be moved and authorized the Treasury Secretary to manage the transfer of their funds to prevent the funds from falling into German hands. According to the Treasury Department's monthly report, the United Kingdom withdrew a substantial amount of short-term bank loans in January of this year. The balance at the end of January was $586,295,000, which was $60 million less than the previous month. The United Kingdom sold more US securities than it bought, with sales exceeding purchases by $12,365,000. Switzerland and the Netherlands continued to purchase US securities in large quantities, with Switzerland newly purchasing $4,444,000 and the Netherlands newly purchasing $1,614,000.

<h3 id="e47">Ministry of Education Relief for Current University Students Whose Admission Qualifications Do Not Meet Requirements; Should Participate in the 29th Unified Enrollment Examination <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing Air Mail) Article 3 of the University Regulations stipulates the following regarding university or independent college admission qualifications: candidates must have graduated from a public or registered private senior high school or equivalent, and must have passed the entrance examination. However, in recent years, some schools have admitted new students whose qualifications did not meet requirements and were disapproved by the Ministry of Education, yet they continued to study at the schools. These students have either completed two or three academic years, or are about to graduate, and have repeatedly requested relief from the Ministry of Education. It is now heard that, in order to safeguard the studies of these students, the Ministry of Education has formulated the following relief measures:</p>
<p>(1) All current students in all grades of public and private universities or independent colleges in the 28th academic year whose admission qualifications do not meet the requirements and have not been approved by the Ministry shall uniformly participate in the unified enrollment examination for the 29th academic year. Only those who pass the examination will be granted approval for their admission. (2) All students whose admission qualifications are in compliance but have been instructed by the Ministry to submit or exchange formal certificates, as well as students who have forged certificates and have been ordered to be expelled, and students whose admission qualifications do not meet requirements and have already left the school (regardless of whether they have withdrawn or are on leave of absence), shall not be handled in accordance with the preceding measures. (3) Each school and college shall compile a roster of current students in all grades in the 28th academic year whose admission qualifications do not meet the requirements, detailing their names, genders, ages, native places, departments or majors, current grades, dates of admission, details of the Ministry's review and disapproval of their admission qualifications, the dates and numbers of the official documents issued, and other relevant notes. The roster shall be submitted to the Ministry for record-keeping before the end of May of this year. The academic records of students who participate in the examination without having been reported to the Ministry will not be retroactively recognized. (4) The schools and colleges shall issue certificates to students whose admission qualifications do not meet the requirements for their participation in the unified enrollment examination, and shall instruct the students to clearly indicate this in the remarks column of the registration form when registering. (5) Students whose admission qualifications do not meet the requirements and who participate in the unified enrollment examination but fail shall not be allowed to continue their studies in the 29th academic year. (6) These relief measures are limited to this year only.</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Ministry of Education Actively Enhances Biological Specimens for Schools <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Engaging Staff to Trial Produce</p>
<p>(Chongqing Air Mail) In view of the urgent need to enrich biological experimental specimens for schools in the rear, the Ministry of Education has engaged Ma Rumei as a special editor to conduct trial production at the National No. 2 Middle School in Hechuan. It is reported that Mr. Ma is very knowledgeable in biology. For the convenience of collecting materials this time, he has been working on the creation of dissection specimens of five types of vertebrates—mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish—according to the curriculum standards promulgated by the Ministry. One set has already been completed in the past year (each set consists of forty bottles), and has been reviewed by National Central University and the Academia Sinica, who found it satisfactory. Recently, forty sets have been produced and partially distributed to national middle schools and the Zhongshan Middle School for application.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education considers the production of these specimens to be very important for the study of biology in schools. In addition to continuing the above work, it has recently instructed the Biology Department of West China Union University in Chengdu to undertake the production and complete five sets of biological specimen models for senior high schools and one hundred sets for junior high schools within a specified time period (the prices for each set have also been determined: 1,000 yuan per set for senior high schools, and 500 yuan per set for junior high schools), so as to fully supply schools in the rear with the application.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Cycling Association's 6th Cycling Competition was held at Jiaozhou Public Park yesterday (Sunday) morning at 8:00 a.m. in a warm spring breeze and bright sunshine. There were more than 2,000 spectators. The competition included nine events, with 84 athletes participating. Mr. Tang Guanyi, the chairman of the association, has served as chairman for 15 years. Due to his advanced age, he has voluntarily resigned and retired. The association is grateful for Mr. Tang's pioneering efforts in establishing the Shanghai Cycling Association and his more than 20 years of dedicated service. Therefore, it specially invited Mr. A.H. George, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, to present Mr. Tang with an exquisite cane on behalf of the Shanghai Cycling Association as a souvenir.

<p>Tomorrow is International Labor Day. The labor community in this city will, as usual, take a day off to celebrate. However, due to the special circumstances, no gatherings will be held. At a time when the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction are in full swing, laborers should uphold the spirit of coordination, cooperate fully, and overcome difficulties together. Therefore, most of the labor-management disputes in some factories have been resolved satisfactorily before yesterday. It is also learned that the foreign labor community in Bing City will also stop working tomorrow to celebrate enthusiastically. In particular, the American community believes that the Labor Day was initiated in 1884 by various powerful labor groups in the United States to strive for the "3 8 system" (i.e., 8 hours of work, 8 hours of rest, and 8 hours of sleep). They agreed to request the employers to implement it on May 1st of the following year (1886), so the American community's celebration will be even more enthusiastic. In addition, the police authorities of the two concessions, fearing that unscrupulous elements would mix into the concessions and take the opportunity to create trouble, have decided to implement a state of alert tomorrow and check suspicious pedestrians.</p>
<p>Shame and Integrity Movement Encourages Workers</p>
<p>The Shame and Integrity Movement Committee of the city's labor community issued a "Letter to Shanghai Laborers" on the occasion of the May 1st Labor Day commemoration, saying that the May 1st Labor Day commemoration is an international labor movement. This date was decided by the International National Eight Congress of Chicago, USA in 1884. The purpose of the movement is to achieve a system of eight hours of work, eight hours of education, and eight hours of rest per day. Later, almost every corner of the world was shrouded in this demonstration movement. China is a part of the international community, and it cannot ignore the labor movement. Moreover, in the journey towards freedom and independence, it feels particularly exciting to commemorate this day. However, China's current reality is different from that of European and American countries, and the supreme principle guiding the national revolution—the Three Principles of the People—has essential differences. We are currently standing on the front line of national liberation, fighting fiercely and arduously with Japanese imperialism, and we must complete the task of national reconstruction in this long-term struggle. In other words, we are beginning to practice the work of the Three Principles of the People. Chinese laborers must understand the importance of their current responsibilities and what responsibilities they should fulfill. They must first understand the relationship between themselves and the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction. The lives of laborers are painful, and poverty, unemployment, and disasters are pressing down on them. The biggest reason is that they are subjected to the political and economic aggression of imperialism, which has led to the bankruptcy of rural areas, the depression of cities, and the inability of national industries to develop. Except for comprador classes who may have the opportunity to make a fortune, most industrial and commercial circles are in a state of half-dead. The general public, due to their weak purchasing power, coupled with the influx of imported goods into the market, directly affects the country's industry and indirectly affects the working masses. Especially in the past twenty years, Japanese imperialism has caused us the greatest pain. Now China is fighting for freedom and independence, for the realization of the Three Principles of the People, and also for world peace and justice. While resisting the war, we are also striving to implement constitutional government and large-scale economic construction to improve people's livelihoods and strengthen our military strength. When the final victory comes, the problems of labor unemployment, education, health, and entertainment will inevitably be resolved satisfactorily, because the biggest goal of the Principle of People's Livelihood is to achieve a balanced livelihood and eliminate pain, and the implementation of industrial plans has direct benefits for laborers. Therefore, the only way for Chinese laborers to survive is to recognize the environment, develop organizations, participate in the War of Resistance, and participate in national reconstruction, and use their entire spirit and strength to strive for a happy and glorious future. There are three points that we should recognize at present, namely, first, participate in the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction; second, unite labor and management; and third, reject traitors. We know that in the past three years, whether on the front line, in the rear, or in the occupied areas, laborers have made great contributions to all aspects of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and we hope to further develop their efforts in the future, especially the movement to eliminate traitors.</p>

<p>More than 3,000 meat shops in the Public Concession and the French Concession of this city closed down the day before yesterday due to the interruption of supplies. It is learned that more than 3,000 live pigs had been transported from Jiangbei the afternoon before yesterday, so the meat shops in this city resumed business yesterday. Another thousand live pigs were transported yesterday, but the amount of goods is too small and may not be enough to meet the market demand.</p>

<p>Six submarines of the 141st to 146th Submarine Division of the US Navy's Asian Fleet stationed in the Philippines, led by the submarine tender USS Canopus, departed from the Philippines on the 13th of this month, came to Shanghai via 杳港, and were anchored on the Yangshupu anchorage. They have been staying in Shanghai for about half a month. At about 6:00 a.m. yesterday, the six submarines successively raised their anchors, and from 7:45 a.m. to 7:55 a.m., within 20 minutes, the six submarines sailed out of the Wusongkou one after another and headed north. The tender USS Canopus also departed from Shanghai at about 10:00 a.m. yesterday and left Wusongkou at 12:10 p.m. at noon, and went to Yantai for docking. This is an annual summer exercise of the US Navy's Asian Fleet on the waters off Yantai in North China, so there are still many destroyers following to participate in North China.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Today's April Quarter-End: All Industries Profit and Pass Safely; Transaction Volume Approximately 20-30 Million Yuan; Mostly Old Customers Rolling Over Accounts, Few New Loans <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Today is the April quarter-end for Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors, and all deposits and loans that need to be settled will be determined on a large scale today. For loans that are due, all banks will provide accommodation for extension. However, new loans are particularly cautious, and there are not many transactions. The entire financial market remains stable, and there should be no problems for all industries to safely pass the April quarter-end. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Money Shops Issue Notice: Internal Market Quotation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Shop Association issued a notice to all member shops, saying, "We hereby inform you that an internal market meeting was held at 2:00 p.m. on April 25th, and the full resolution was six yuan and two jiao, which is recorded in the file. Please comply accordingly." Now, each shop has "added prices" based on the "internal market" quotation to settle long-term interest rates. The amount of the "added price" varies from one yuan to several yuan. Generally, an agreement must be reached between the two parties before a transaction can be made.</p>
<p>Handling the April Quarter-End: General Closing Matters</p>
<p>Today is the only general closing period for loans that are due and new loans, and the period for running around and making contacts is also limited to this day. It is heard that the total transaction volume for the April quarter-end is 20-30 million yuan, with the most being from factories, firms, and old customers in the domestic goods industry, and sugar and northern goods firms. Long-term interest rates range from 8% to 1.5%. As for the receipt and settlement of the money and silver industries, the time for settlement has been extended due to the particularly busy schedule of the April quarter-end. The volume of negotiable instruments exchanged at the bank clearing house has increased sharply.</p>
<p>Financial Stability: All Industries Pass Safely</p>
<p>Since the four banks of the Central Bank, China Bank, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China have provided loans, and the money and silver industry has adjusted the reserve warehouse and implemented new foreign exchange plans, the market remains stable. However, due to excessive speculation, it is necessary to slightly increase interest rates to prevent it, so the money supply in the market is superficially tight, but in fact, speculative funds are still abundant. The financial situation is similar to that before the war. There is no possibility of bank or firm failures. Moreover, due to the abnormal development of Shanghai, all industries have made large profits, and there is no problem for the safe passage of the April quarter-end.</p>

<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce recently received a letter from a member stating, "Travelers taking the route from China to the United States via Japan have great difficulty carrying foreign exchange purchased in China or outside Japan when leaving Japan. The Japanese authorities seem not to allow anyone to carry foreign exchange worth more than 500 yen out of the country without permission." The American Chamber of Commerce then wrote to the American Consulate in Kobe to explain this difficulty and asked whether travelers could declare the foreign exchange they were carrying when entering Japan, so that they would not be obstructed when carrying the foreign exchange out of Japan. The American Consulate in Kobe replied to the Tianjin American Chamber of Commerce, saying that the matter had been reported to the American Embassy in Japan. However, Japan is currently implementing foreign exchange controls, and the only way for travelers to avoid trouble is to remit the foreign exchange worth more than 500 yen directly to the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Another Dispute Occurred at the Lonely Army Barracks on Jiaozhou Road Yesterday; White Russian Team Planned to Raise the Surrounding Barbed Wire Fence; Commander Xie Strictly Refused and a Dispute Arose <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Outside the Lonely Army Barracks on Jiaozhou Road in West Shanghai, there was originally a White Russian team stationed. At 2:30 p.m. yesterday, a dispute suddenly broke out between the White Russian team and the soldiers of the Lonely Army Barracks. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Tense Situation</p>
<p>The Lonely Army Barracks was playing a basketball game on the parade ground with the Golden Pagoda Basketball Team of the Fuxin Tobacco Company at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. In addition to those participating in the game, most of the soldiers in the barracks were watching, and only guards were left to guard the gate of the barracks. At this time, the White Russian team outside the door suddenly argued loudly with the soldiers guarding the gate. The soldiers in the barracks heard the sound and immediately stopped the basketball game. At this time, the White Russian team planned to enter the barracks, but fortunately, they were stopped by the Lonely Army. Commander Xie also remained calm, so no major accident occurred. After the dispute occurred, the concession authorities were informed and immediately sent two patrol cars to suppress it. The Italian defense forces also arrived by car at about 5:00 p.m. For a while, the situation on Jiaozhou Road was very tense. When the two sides confronted each other, the White Russian team gathered at the gate of the barracks with weapons, monitoring the Lonely Army. The Golden Pagoda Basketball Team of the Fuxin Tobacco Company, which was competing with the Lonely Army, could not finish the game, so they planned to leave the barracks at about 6:00 p.m. When they reached the gate of the barracks, the White Russian team mistakenly thought that the Lonely Army was rushing out and stopped them. After explanation, they were able to leave the barracks safely. By about 8:00 p.m., the situation gradually eased, and the vehicles of the Italian defense forces also withdrew.</p>
<p>Cause of the Dispute</p>
<p>It is learned that the cause of the dispute was that the White Russian team indicated to the Lonely Army Barracks that they planned to raise the barbed wire fence around the barracks. The barbed wire fence around the barracks was originally seven feet high. Now, the White Russian team planned to raise it by three feet to a height of one zhang, and all the expenses required would have to be borne by the Lonely Army. Commander Xie, the leader of the Lonely Army, strictly refused, believing that raising the barbed wire fence was purely the other party's business and that the Lonely Army Barracks could not bear this loss. The White Russian team insisted on not giving up and unilaterally raised the barbed wire fence yesterday afternoon, and insisted on demanding compensation from the Lonely Army Barracks. The two sides refused to budge, which led to the dispute.</p>

<p>The NYK Line's "Tatsuta Maru," carrying 800 passengers, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. Among the passengers were two high-ranking Japanese officials of the Shanghai Municipal Council. One was Mr. Makoto Ta, the vice chairman of the Central China Railway Company, who was newly elected as a Japanese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council but resigned before taking office. The other was Mr. Furuya, the former chief of the Hokkaido Police Bureau in Japan, who has now been appointed as the chief of Sector E of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department. Sector E police district was created as a result of the agreement between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side regarding the return of police authority in Hongkou. In addition, the ship's passengers included 160 new students from the Toa Dobun Shoin (East Asia Common Culture Academy) coming to Shanghai to study.</p>

<p>Previously, in order to strengthen defenses, the concession authorities specially installed iron wire nets at the entrances of major alleys to block traffic, which has affected businesses in the alleys, especially in the Nanjing Road area. They have repeatedly petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council to approve the removal of the iron wire nets. Now, dozens of businesses including the Meiling Pharmacy located at 614 Nanjing Road in the Xinda Hsiang Building, have jointly petitioned the Municipal Council's Director-General to quickly remove the nets to facilitate traffic.</p>
<h3 id="e68">If War Breaks Out Between the United States and Japan, Japan Should Be Held Responsible; Japan Will Not Seize the Dutch East Indies; If It Does, It Would Be Suicide: Sassoon's Remarks After Returning to Shanghai <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," Sir Victor Sassoon, a Shanghai financier, returned to Shanghai from the United States on the morning of the 29th and told reporters that the United States would not participate in the European war unless forced to do so. American business has not yet experienced a sudden boom due to the war, but the general public clearly has a sense that business is about to develop and that unemployment will decrease. The United States does not want war, so Americans generally have the impression that if war breaks out between the United States and Japan, Japan will be to blame. Japan will not seize the Dutch East Indies, as this action would trigger war, which would not be in Japan's interest. If Japan were to do so, it would be suicide. For the sake of Japan's and all relevant countries' interests, the United States and Japan should not engage in war, which would give the Soviet Union an opportunity to expand its influence in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Defenses Should Not Be Underestimated</p>
<p>Recently, a certain foreigner (J.B.) arrived in Shanghai from Java, the capital of the Dutch East Indies. According to his conversation with the French-language "Journal de Shanghai," he praised the improvements in the defenses of the Dutch East Indies in great detail. According to (J.B.), the Dutch East Indies has 2,500 senior military officers and 43,000 junior military officers. Its military organization includes more than 20 infantry battalions, more than 10 cavalry and mechanized units, and numerous artillery and engineering units. Its military budget for this year is approximately 140 million Dutch guilders, accounting for approximately 25% of revenue. In addition, the strength of its air force and navy has also greatly increased in recent years, and it now has many cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. Its military equipment is completely independent from that of the Netherlands. According to (J.B.'s) observation, the Dutch East Indies can defend itself if attacked by Japan, and the British and American navies will certainly rise up to assist the Dutch East Indies at that time.</p>
<p>Starr's Observations on the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," Mr. C.V. Starr, the chairman of the board of the English-language "China Press" and American Asiatic Underwriters, returned to Shanghai from the United States on the morning of the 29th. According to his remarks, if Japan intends to take action against the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam, the United States will certainly retaliate, or cut off a large part of Japan's existing foreign trade in order to curb it. If American interests in China are in danger, then the United States should already prohibit the export of war materials to Japan.</p>
<p>The Entire Issue</p>
<p>Is Very Important, Related to America's Pacific Policy, Even Its Standard of Living. However, the US government has already abolished the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation several months ago, and therefore a US embargo against Japan is evidently imminent. In recent years, American</p>
<p>China Policy</p>
<p>Has Been Definite and Consistent. As for the possibility of the United States participating in the European war, many people believe that the United States will participate in the war within a year. However, he believes that this will depend on the fortunes of the Allied Powers. If the Allied Powers are clearly on the verge of defeat, then the United States will send troops to help, just as the United States participated in the World War. As for whether President Roosevelt will seek reelection for a</p>
<p>Third Term as President</p>
<p>Depends on Whether He Can Find a Candidate to Entrust with the Responsibility. President Roosevelt must choose someone he can trust as this candidate to carry out his democratic and foreign policies. However, if President Roosevelt is pushed forward, then he may be chosen for reelection for a third term.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, in accordance with the seventh resolution passed at the taxpayers' annual meeting on April 17 of this year, issued 16 million yuan of new 6% public bonds for 1940, calculated in the local Chinese currency. The first interest payment date is December 31 of this year, and thereafter, interest will be paid twice a year on June 30 and December 20, and the principal will be repaid by lottery once each time, until December 31, 1950, when the principal and interest will be fully repaid. It was decided to issue the bonds at 95% of face value. It is reported that the bonds were publicly issued at the council's Finance Department at 10:00 AM yesterday. It is now known that the above-mentioned bonds were fully subscribed yesterday afternoon. These public bonds are divided into five denominations: 10,000 yuan, 5,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, and 100 yuan. A corresponding amount from the special business fee paid to the council by the Shanghai Power Company and the Shanghai Waterworks Company due to the price increase in August 1938 has been designated and deposited in a special account opened at HSBC to guarantee the repayment of principal and interest.</p>

<p>The British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s North China Line steamer "Lishun" was originally scheduled to depart from Tianjin for Shanghai last Tuesday (the 23rd). Before leaving port in Tianjin, a large quantity of smuggled silver dollars, packed in a barrel, was discovered in the ship by Japanese customs inspectors. There were also 40,000 Japanese yen. After learning of this, the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin summoned the ship's comprador, second comprador, supervisor, stoker, and other crew members, totaling seven people, for interrogation. As a result, the ship was unable to leave Tianjin, causing a delay in its arrival in Shanghai. According to the company's news, the personnel from the "Lishun" who were summoned by the Japanese military were all released last Friday. The ship departed from Tianjin last Saturday afternoon for Shanghai, making a stop at Yantai en route. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e72">No Apparent Motive in the Murder of Briton Kalin; Thugs May Have Opened Fire Out of Fear of Arrest; Deceased Was Not a Bodyguard of British Director Hiley <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>According to the "Shanghai Times," Kalin, a 53-year-old British man, was a caretaker at the Buttle-Layton Co. residential complex for employees on Crescent Road off Yu Yuen Road. At 9:20 AM on the 28th, Kalin, unarmed, was watching alone on Crescent Road when he saw two Chinese men with suspicious appearances passing by. Because the road was the private property of Buttle-Layton Co., Kalin went forward to question the two men as to why they were entering this private road. Unexpectedly, the two thugs pulled out guns and shot Kalin to death before fleeing. According to</p>
<p>Witnesses, Kalin questioned the thugs, but before he could say a few words, the thugs opened fire three times, hitting him and causing him to fall to the ground with serious injuries. By the time the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department received the report and sent a team to the scene to investigate, Kalin was barely alive. He was rushed to the Country Hospital in an ambulance, but he died en route. The case seems to have no motive. It may be that the thugs had already entered the private road and were afraid of being arrested by Kalin, so in order to escape, they each took out</p>
<p>Mauser pistols, with one firing one shot and the other firing two shots, all hitting Kalin. Then they fled. As of the night of the 28th, no suspects had been arrested or detained. The Police Department is currently making every effort to investigate in order to apprehend the perpetrators and bring them to justice. However, Crescent Road and the surrounding area are outside the settlement, which hinders the investigation work. British coroner Haynes is scheduled to examine Kalin's body at the Country Hospital on the morning of the 29th.</p>
<p>Crescent Road</p>
<p>Is the private property of Buttle-Layton Co., leading from Yu Yuen Road to several large residences where senior employees of Buttle-Layton Co. live. At the entrance is a small shed for Kalin to watch from. The crime occurred on a small bridge about 200 yards from the entrance of Crescent Road from Yu Yuen Road, where Kalin often questioned Chinese people passing by. Kalin worked as a sailor on merchant ships for many years. After coming to Shanghai, he got married and worked at the Customs for a time.</p>
<p>He then retired and, about two and a half years ago, obtained the position of caretaker at the Buttle-Layton Co. employee residence. He lived at 52 Hua Kee Road. His daughter, Julia, works at the Dutch Indies Bank. After the crime occurred, the thugs left behind three bullet casings, which have been taken by the Police Department to the firearms department for inspection. The officer in charge of handling the case is Vice Detective Yang Ge of the Jing'an Temple Police Station. When Kalin was killed,</p>
<p>He was wearing casual clothes, not a uniform. The thugs, one dressed in Chinese clothing and the other in Western clothing. The rumor circulating among the Chinese that Kalin was the bodyguard of Hiley, the new director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, is actually not true. Hiley is a director of Buttle-Layton Co. and merely lives in the house guarded by Kalin. According to the police, the case has no motive for murder. Kalin's funeral date has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Japanese Businesses Request Shanghai and Central China Be Removed From the Yen Bloc in Order to Facilitate the Dumping of Japanese Goods and Compete Commercially With Third Countries <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>According to the French-language "Journal de Shanghai," recently, according to Japanese sources, several prominent Japanese businessmen have petitioned the government, requesting that Shanghai and even Central China be completely removed from the yen bloc in order to facilitate the dumping of Japanese goods. According to the plan of the Japanese businessmen, after the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are opened in the future, the commercial competition between the Japanese and third countries will inevitably become more intense. If Shanghai and Central China are removed from the yen bloc, Japanese goods can be reduced in price by as much as 6.6 jiao per yen. Currently, the value of Japanese goods in Shanghai is actually three times higher than in Japan. It is now reported that Shanghai Japanese businesses have a large accumulation of rayon, woolen fabrics, chemical raw materials, dyes, paper, and other goods that cannot be dumped in Shanghai and must be re-exported to various countries, which is a very troublesome procedure. Therefore, Japanese businesses are vigorously petitioning their government to remove Shanghai and Central China from the yen bloc.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Special Report: Tchaikovsky Centennial Celebration: Shanghai Holds Musical Gala; Performing Masterpieces from Tchaikovsky's Life <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Maestro Paci, conductor of the Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra, told visiting news reporters yesterday afternoon: "I hope the press can support us, so that the ladies and gentlemen of Shanghai who love music, after listening to this Centennial Memorial Concert of the great Russian composer Tchaikovsky (P.J. Tchaikovsky), will become interested in ballet."</p>
<p>When Maestro Paci was speaking happily, he gestured with his hands and arms, his words were powerful and clear, making people imagine the state he was in on the music stage, with his ups and downs, fast and slow rhythms, when he was conducting.</p>
<p>He said that in mid-May, the world will be holding celebrations to commemorate the centenary of this great composer's birth. The Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra plans to hold a "Tchaikovsky Music Festival" in late May to commemorate this immortal Russian music master of the past. The dates are a total of three days—the 21st, 24th, and 26th—performing various masterpieces of Tchaikovsky. The first night is chamber music, with Russian musicians participating; the second night is ballet, and the third night is symphonic music. The time is all at 9:15 PM, the venue is mainly the Lyceum Theatre, and an advertisement will be announced a few days before the performances.</p>
<p>"Full house...full house," Maestro Paci said, "I want to make all three nights a full house," he said, becoming particularly excited, tapping his hands frequently on the table. His meaning was that the tickets are for all three performances and should be pre-sold early; tickets for only one performance will only be available for purchase a few days before the performances, and the price will be much higher.</p>
<p>In this Tchaikovsky Centennial Music Week, the most interesting will be the second night—that is, the ballet on Friday the 24th, "Swan Lake". The Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra, led by Maestro Paci, will perform the music, and the Russian Ballet Troupe will perform the dance. This is the first time that the string orchestra and the ballet troupe will cooperate, and it is expected that under this "difficult combination," the results will be "very beautiful".</p>
<p>"Swan Lake" is a mature work of Tchaikovsky from 1876. In 1877, he composed the opera "Eugene Onegin"—the story of this opera was originally written by Pushkin. In March 1879, Tchaikovsky premiered his music at the Moscow Conservatory of Music, achieving great success. Therefore, "Swan Lake" can also be said to be a great work of Tchaikovsky that is as immortal as his operatic masterpieces.</p>
<p>Ms. Jin, the pillar and genius artist of the Russian Ballet Troupe, will play the leading role of Princess Swan. Mr. Slutsky has also been invited to conduct the Shanghai Municipal Council String Orchestra. The performance of this ballet troupe is hosted by Mr. Sokosky and Mr. Shifrekin. Maestro Paci also mentioned that three Russian musicians will participate in the chamber music performance, one of whom is the young piano virtuoso Shikhanov, whose talent is highly praised by Maestro Paci.</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky was born on May 7, 1840, in Votkinsk, and his father was a mining engineer. Tchaikovsky initially studied law and also worked in the Ministry of Justice, but he had musical talent and often appeared as a loving musician, which was praised by people. The rigid law was certainly not what he liked. Later, he entered the St. Petersburg Conservatory of Music, where he was recognized by the director, the great musician Rubinstein. From then on, Tchaikovsky devoted his life to music.</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky composed two symphonies in his life, both of which are popular works. Other ballets, operas, etc. were also very popular for a time, but his most famous masterpiece was still the one that succeeded after 1876. In 1893, he completed the Pathetique symphony, which was admired by people abroad. In that year, he conducted his own works at Cambridge and received an honorary doctorate in music. But, unfortunately, on November 6, this great musician, who was famous for a time, died of cholera in St. Petersburg at the age of 53.</p>
<p>The life of a great artist often makes people sigh! Although this Tchaikovsky had romances and was known by beauties and literati, it seemed that he could not resist the misfortunes that came to him. Man is originally controlled by fate. He was married, but soon divorced his wife; he also attempted suicide due to illness in St. Petersburg, but fortunately he did not succeed. Otherwise, where would there be people in Shanghai, a foreign country, commemorating him a hundred years later today!</p>

<p>Since Britain and France declared war on Germany, all traffic and trade between the two countries have been completely cut off, and their original commercial relations in the Far East have also come to a standstill. According to information from the shipping industry, in addition to taking strict surveillance and precautions, the commercial relations of the warring countries operating in the Far East</p>
<p>Have Been Severed.</p>
<p>Therefore, all shipping operations have also come to a standstill. Most of the foreign companies in Shanghai that handle shipping insurance are British. Merchant ships operating in the Far East of various countries mostly insure with British insurance companies. Now that British and German businesses have been largely cut off, the companies are</p>
<p>Ceasing Insurance</p>
<p>For German Ships.</p>
<p>Therefore, the insurance matters of existing German merchant ships have been widely taken over by American insurance companies. However, American insurance companies believe that at this time of war, there are many risks for ships. Although there are no problems with navigation in the Far East, the situation is different compared to peacetime, so the insurance premiums they charge cannot but be increased. In recent months, there have been</p>
<p>Successive Premium Increases</p>
<p>Many Times. As of now, the insurance premium accounts for one-fifteenth of the insured amount, that is, a German ship insured for 150,000 yuan must pay an insurance premium of about 10,000 yuan, which is about twice as much as before the European war.</p>

<p>The authorities of the two concessions are concerned about commodity prices and their impact on people's livelihoods, and have organized special committees to study and adjust them from various aspects in order to suppress price increases. In addition to preventing hoarding and speculation, the first concrete measure is to order all shops,菜塲, etc. to mark the prices of the items they sell so that citizens can compare and choose. However, since the bureau distributed sample price tags, most of the companies, except for the major companies and shoe stores that already had price labeling methods, have been taking a wait-and-see attitude. Most citizens now hope that the concession authorities will strictly implement this measure as the first step in suppressing price increases. In addition, price increases are still strong this month, especially for food, vegetables, fish, and delicacies, which are even more expensive. As a result, the livelihood of citizens is becoming increasingly difficult, and it is hoped that the authorities will do their best to dredge the sources of supply.</p>

<p>At 4:30 AM yesterday, five robbers broke into the Ru Da butcher shop at 525 Weihaiwei Road in the International Settlement. Each held sharp blades and fake pistols, accosting the shop's owner, Yong native Fang A'mao (30 years old), near the counter, ordering him to remain silent. Unexpectedly, Fang was quite alert and, noticing the foremost bandit's gun was a fake, he jumped up and embraced the thief while shouting for the police. Seeing things were going poorly, one of the remaining robbers stepped forward and stabbed Fang in the chest with a sharp blade, causing him to bleed profusely and fall to the ground. The robbers, not daring to linger, rushed out the door and fled north towards Muirhead Road. Although wounded, Fang bravely struggled to his feet and pursued them.

<p>A massive fire broke out at the Hongxing lumber yard located near the Beiding Water Bridge on the Beiyangjing Road in Pudong yesterday afternoon, completely destroying the yard buildings and the lumber piles. A significant amount of timber was also destroyed, with losses amounting to over ten thousand yuan. The fire started around 1:30 PM. Only two carpenters were sawing wood at the time, with no one else present. It is unknown how, but thick smoke started to rise from a pile of straw, suddenly bursting into flames before the carpenters could react. The fire quickly spread to other lumber piles, raging skyward and engulfing two houses to the south and five to the north. The fire intensified, and Japanese marines, soldiers, and unarmed police arrived on the scene but were helpless to stop it. After two hours, the seven buildings of the lumber yard were reduced to rubble. The fire in the lumber piles continued to burn until 6:00 PM yesterday evening, completely turning everything to ashes. Although half of the timber was salvaged, the other half was charred beyond recognition. The owner of the lumber yard, Chen Yueqiu, is engaged in construction business in Shanghai. His son, Miaosheng, and his wife both passed away in recent years. Their coffins, temporarily placed inside the lumber yard, were also destroyed in the fire. The total loss is estimated at tens of thousands of yuan. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.</p>

<p>Yesterday, spot gold prices were sluggish, with prices continuing to trend downwards. There's a clear sense of nostalgia for the days when gold was favored. Daytime trading was still relatively active due to securities firms needing to sell, but prices struggled to rise. The initial asking price was 5,600 yuan, with banks slightly increasing bids to a high of 5,600.05 yuan. However, due to easing exchange rates, securities firms and money changers initiated selling, causing a sharp drop to a low of 5,540 yuan. The midday close was only 5,565 yuan. In the afternoon, substantial buying activity by speculators helped prices recover to 5,585 yuan, but the final close was 5,572.50 yuan, down 38 yuan from the previous weekend. Approximately 2,000-3,000 taels were traded throughout the day. Gold jewelry prices initially fell but then leveled out. Customs duties remain unchanged.</p>

Gold shops sold 20 taels to banks at 5,565 yuan, which became the midday close. In the afternoon, prices opened flat. Securities firms sold 10 taels to gold shops at 5,565 yuan.

As buying interest waned, money changers began selling, pushing prices down by 13 yuan. Banks sold 20 taels to gold shops at 5,572.50 yuan, which became the evening close.

<p>Yesterday, British and American pounds continued to face downward pressure. Trading in British gold notes was balanced in the morning, but in the afternoon, the black market exchange rate for British currency suddenly rose by 0.015625, leading to increased selling pressure. The evening market retreated to 55 yuan and 2 jiao. American notes initially rose to 16 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen, but then the black market rate for American currency dried up, causing the rate to fall to 16 yuan, 1 jiao, and 8 fen briefly. It later fell to 16 yuan and 2 jiao, down 1 jiao and 1 fen from the previous Saturday. The Hong Kong currency market was weak due to a decline in the Shanghai exchange rate.

<p>In yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange rates continued to decline. Speculators who had previously been aggressively buying were now the primary sellers in the market. Banque de l'Indochine, a French bank, also heavily sold off. As a result, HSBC maintained its supply price, which had not changed since February 29th of this year, and was able to convert to 4 shillings, 1 penny, 125, and the highest point reached 4 shillings, 1 penny, 140625. American exchange rates also reached a high of 6.0625 yuan. Although the rates eventually stabilized, banks were willing to sell at 6.0625 yuan for American exchange rates, indicating a recovery. This was because speculators were being forced to sell. As a result, the British gold rate closed at 4 shillings, 1 penny, 140625, and the American exchange rate closed at 6.0625 yuan. The British rate was up 0.015625 from the previous close, and the American rate was down 0.03125. The futures market showed the same trends as the spot market.</p>
<p>Banque de l'Indochine Sells Heavily</p>

The American rate was down 375 against the British rate, down 5 points against the Shanghai rate, and unchanged against the French rate. The central bank's listed rates for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot selling price at 4 shillings, 1 penny, 125 for British gold and 6.03125 yuan for American exchange, the same as the previous close. The futures market opened unchanged. After the opening, speculators began to sell, causing the market to shift from flat to weak. It was reported that outside investors bought American currency for May delivery from speculators at 5.84375 yuan. HSBC's listed rates remained unchanged. The silver tax was announced with no increases or decreases. Subsequently, rumors circulated that banks were making small purchases. The May futures rate was the same as the spot rate. However, speculators were eager to sell, and Banque de l'Indochine and other banks were selling heavily, causing the market to weaken. Speculators sold British gold for April delivery to outside investors at 4 shillings, 1 penny, 140625, and Chinese currency at 6.00625. HSBC also took in spot British gold from Banque de l'Indochine at 4 shillings, 1 penny, 140625, and the spot American currency rate was said to be 6.009375 yuan. By the noon hour, the situation had softened slightly, but even at the 6.0625 yuan price for spot American currency, banks were reluctant to sell. At the close, the spot British rate was 4 shillings, 1 penny, 125, the Chinese currency rate was 6.03125 yuan, the May British gold rate was 4 shillings, and the May American exchange rate was 5.8125 yuan.

<p>Trading on the securities exchange became even more subdued yesterday, and the market was increasingly sluggish. A few bulls attempted to raise prices, but there was little support from the broader market, leading to quick declines. The current credit crunch in Shanghai, which is usually awash with funds, is said to be worse than in previous years. It is reported that the four major banks are rarely releasing legal tender and are not allowing loan extensions. This is especially impactful as the end of the month approaches. This measure is intended to reduce financial speculation and allow the foreign exchange rate to float, while preventing unexpected surges in prices. Government bonds have been significantly affected by this trend. Although the draw of the Ding Chou Railway is not far off, it seems no one is paying attention. Most trading involved Lien Yee buying and Lien Ho selling, with the majority of other transactions being sales. Although there was not much activity from retail investors, it was relatively lively. As a result, the A, B, and C types remained unchanged, while the D and E types fell slightly by five fen and one jiao, respectively. The total turnover was approximately 400,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 20 shares of Continental Bank stock were traded, with a price of 670 yuan per share (face value of 1,000 yuan).</p>
<p>Trading on the Public Brokers Association stock market was active, and prices were well-maintained. The firm trend did not diminish from the usual start-of-the-week appearance. However, the volume of sellers increased significantly later, and many types were immediately affected and gradually declined. The Lundin stock was once again subject to pressure from sellers and closed at 180 yuan. The reasons behind the weakness of the stock prices of the companies each holding the shares are generally based on this. The National stock fell from 34.25 yuan to 32 yuan, the Shanghai stock fell from 34.5 yuan to 32.5 yuan, and the Yangtze stock fell from 21 yuan to 20 yuan.</p>
<p>In the financial market this week, in addition to the stock settlement requiring a large amount of cash, the settlement of bills of exchange and cotton yarn also requires large amounts to be handled. It is unknown how little the influence of the recent switch in the financial base can be known.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks are extremely quiet, with narrow price fluctuations. The Lan Xia Zhi was more active, briefly reaching 37 yuan, but also fell to 35.5 yuan at the close.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Anglo-Java Rubber Company <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>To Issue a Final Dividend Again</p>
<p>The Anglo-Java Rubber Company Limited, managed by British business Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., Ltd., will hold its 30th annual general meeting on May 15th in Shanghai. In addition to the interim dividend of 1.5 yuan per share already paid for the 1939 financial year, the company plans to issue a final dividend of 2.15 yuan per share, for a total dividend of 3.75 yuan per share.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Grains: Round-Grain Rice Sales Become More Active <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The rice market was generally flat and uneventful from morning to midday yesterday. Sellers did not rush to sell due to the inconsistent prices from different rice-producing regions. Buyers, remembering the market slump from the previous week and fearing another drop, were only willing to buy at low prices. Only speculators were actively buying and selling. As a result, the overall market was normal, and the closing price was similar to the previous day.</p>
<p>The total quantity of round-grain rice arriving in Xichang, Qingsi, and Sujia Road totaled no less than 3,000-4,000 bags. Glutinous rice sales were not as robust as round-grain rice, because the price of glutinous rice had recently increased, and only some cake shops and food stalls purchased it, so sales were difficult. Except for some top-quality rice that was difficult to find on the market, most rice which was weak or wet was down three to five jiao. Round-grain rice was therefore cheaper than foreign rice and was popular with most consumers. For this reason, storefronts saw an increase in purchases. Besides the amount listed in official markets, there were also many off-market deals. Specially cleaned round-grain rice sold for 45 yuan, common round-grain rice for around 44 yuan, powdered round-grain rice for 43 yuan, Kunshan-Changzhou round-grain rice for 43-44 yuan, and Qingsi extra thin round-grain rice for 44 yuan, 43 yuan, and 42.5 yuan. South Port early and late rice in original bags sold for 42.5 yuan to 41.5 yuan. Wang Jian rice, which had been out of stock for a long time, sold for 42.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign rice has been affected by the pressure of tight credit lately. It is difficult to make real progress because of the slight rises and immediate drops. Although Japanese merchants and local shops made some small purchases yesterday, many speculators and retail investors were eager to sell, so market prices were still down by two, three, or four jiao. The quantity of spot foreign rice totaled 6,000 bags, and the quantity of futures rice that had been imported was over 300 tons. It was said that Japanese merchants and speculators made the purchases.</p>
<p>Large Imports of Foreign Rice: The French shipping company Messageries Maritimes' freighter Felix Roussel arrived in Shanghai from the West on Sunday with 14,139 bags of foreign rice. It docked at the Shun Tai Wharf in Hongkou. In addition, Jardine Matheson's Tai Seng arrived in Shanghai from Cap Saint Jacques yesterday, carrying 3,069 bags of foreign rice. That company's Desheng also arrived yesterday morning with 1,615 bags of foreign rice from Cap Saint Jacques destined for Tianjin, as well as 2,000 bags of flour.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Flour Mill Prices Reduced by Three Jiao <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of flour from the No. 2 Flour Mill was reduced from 13.8 yuan to 13.5 yuan, a decrease of three jiao. This was because miscellaneous brands of flour from the interior were being shipped to Shanghai for dumping, and retail sales in this district were decreasing daily. In order to maintain operations, the factory voluntarily reduced its prices to stem the losses. It was reported that previously imported flour was being offered at 13.7 yuan, and flour from the interior was priced at 13.2 yuan, but there were no buyers even at this low price because factory prices were expected to fall. Total flour transactions in the city amounted to more than 10,000 bags, all purchased by shops in this district and rural villages. Jobbers, however, were reticent.</p>
<p>Wheat trading was slow yesterday. Old wheat is out of season, and although the new crop has not yet entered the market, harvest prospects are good. With flour mills reporting slow sales, their demand for raw materials is weak. Sellers do not want to follow prices because foreign wheat is expensive and difficult to obtain, so the quantity of wheat being sent to factories daily is very small.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Trading Weak <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The soybean and oilseed cake markets are still in a slump. Prices for local products in the producing areas are reported to be good, but this has not reversed the bad market. Trading was quiet yesterday. Only 80 bags of Yellow Summer soybeans were traded for 21 yuan, and 300 bags of Chongming sand soybeans were traded for 19.8 yuan. Only 4,000 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded for 105.5 yuan, and 10 barrels of Qingdao oil were traded for 104.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Today (the 30th), there are 2,270 bags of soybeans, 1,000 pieces of oilseed cake, and 1,600 cans of crude oil from Haikou.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Cotton and Yarn: 3,000 Bales of American Cotton Arrive Yesterday <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Cotton trading was fairly active, and Indian cotton was especially popular. Market sentiment was stable, and with a good yarn market, the raw material market was especially strong. Factories also had some demand, but large purchases were lacking. The current status of cotton transactions is listed on the left.</p>
<p>In other news, the foreign cotton market saw the New York cotton market initially fall slightly because of the mass exodus, but later rose due to purchases by other traders and speculative short-covering. As a result, closing prices were up five to seven points. The forward price fell by three or four points. The Indian cotton market, along with the estimate, fell by two rupees yesterday. The Egyptian market was closed.</p>
<p>Because of fundraising difficulties, trade in foreign cotton in Shanghai yesterday was comparatively quiet, but in the afternoon, the situation turned better. Because various parties have found a way to transfer funds and they expect cotton prices to keep rising, there were many inquiries about price. Below, cotton market prices are listed with the American exchange rate at 6 yuan including factory fees:</p>
<p>3,000 bales of American cotton arrived in Shanghai yesterday via the U.S. President Lines City of Omaha, which docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou.</p>

<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the trend was extremely strong. The sustained increase in prices prompted some long-term holders to sell and realize profits, causing a slight reaction and a drop in prices. However, some are holding tight due to their belief in a sound economy. Current yarn sales are not as strong as in the past, and inventory has been significantly reduced.</p>
<p>The current yarn market opened with the same enthusiasm as the previous day, and the momentum continued. Twenty-count Double Horse factory yarn rose directly from 1,560 yuan to 1,595 yuan. Afterwards, as investors began realizing profits during the surge, the market weakened slightly and fell by 20 yuan. The closing price was 1,571 yuan. Statistics show that 1,730 bales were traded in half a day. Twenty-count Double Horse yarn rose by 30 yuan. Today, 297 bales of yarn arrived in Cap Saint Jacques, 55 bales were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, 15 bales were shipped to Haikou, and 245 bales were shipped to Haiphong. A breakdown of the quantity purchased by each trade group is listed below:</p>
<p>Traders 1,470, Hong Kong 250, Xiamen 10, Total 7,730</p>

<p>The coal market has seen prices rise since the previous week when the guild released their holdings and Indian coal prices increased by 40 yuan, leading to high prices attracting foreign coal from various regions. A foreign firm had over 2,000 tons of American Bessemer bituminous coal brought in from overseas, which has already arrived at the port. It is currently being transferred at the wharf for sale on the market. The firm is selling lump coal for 215 yuan per ton and coal dust for 190 yuan per ton. Prices delivered to customers are slightly higher to account for transport costs.</p>

<p>The tangerine peel market has seen slight improvements recently. The quality of the goods is better than before, such as Heze tangerine peel being redder and more attractive, but sales have been weak and quotations have not been able to increase further. There was a batch sold at prices slightly lower than before.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Sugar Market: National Sugar Remains Tight <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Group White quoted from Holland, with shipments for June and July still at 8.550. Shanghai Xinyi Company offered 200 tons at a price of 2.450 Dutch guilders. The guild market was stable, with little fluctuation. Spot prices for 24 Group White new goods from foreign warehouses were 63 yuan to 63 yuan and 10 cents, with 300 to 400 bags traded. Old goods were at 62.8 yuan. Taikoo Granulated White remains tight, with B-grade old goods at 73 yuan, up 40 cents. H-grade raw red sugar was at 51 yuan, and Dutch red sugar at 53.5 yuan. Crystal sugar remained tight, with Guangdong-style Dongxiang red sugar at 44.1 to 44.4 yuan, Hainan white sugar at 60 yuan, Huizhou secondary white sugar at 72 yuan, Xinghua secondary white sugar at 75 yuan, and Gao Diao Qing at 53 yuan. A Japanese ship arrived with 100 bags of Diao Qing sugar, priced at 51.8 yuan. Also, yesterday, 17,500 bags of sugar arrived from Holland.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American bar iron market was quite active, with total city transactions reaching 200 to 300 cases. The majority of these went to local canneries and toy factories. Tianjin and Yantai merchants also purchased small amounts. Demand from cigarette and printing factories was also strong. Consequently, traders' confidence increased, and standard prices were up by 1 to 2 yuan. Current market prices are approximately 125 yuan per case for 200-pound figured iron sheets, and around 100 yuan per 200 pounds for smaller sizes, while large figured iron sheets require over 130 yuan per case.</p>

<p>According to Hong Kong news, prices for pangolin scales from mainland China are quite reasonable. Several shipments were transported from Guangzhou Bay by medicine shops and have already been sold. Prices are similar to previous levels and are not easily increased at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Piece Goods: Cotton Cloth Fluctuations Have Lost Their Normal Path <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, the market was sluggish due to weak actual sales. Although yarn prices continued to rise sharply, the impact on cloth prices was minimal. Local merchants taking delivery and selling short for the next month saw slightly improved prices. However, price decreases for other goods lacked support, resulting in confused sales and a departure from normal market patterns. The overall situation remained uncertain. Sales volumes decreased, and Ningbo merchants faced stricter import inspections, causing delivery delays and concerns about potential prohibitions on dyed goods. Consequently, new goods shipments were scarce. Approximately 500 pieces of various goods were purchased from domestic cloth factories. Due to the impact of rising yarn prices on production costs, the factories were more willing to sell off yarn stocks for greater profit, significantly reducing orders for grey cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, cloth prices followed the continued rise in yarn prices. Morning prices for No. 2 Sheng Longtou fine cloth opened at 46.5 yuan per bolt. Enthusiasm from local merchants remained strong, and demand continued to be high, causing prices to rise steadily. The afternoon market price was 47.25 yuan. Futures for the next month were sold at a high price of 49.5 yuan, with an afternoon market price of 49.25 yuan. Large buyers absorbed current and futures contracts for mid-range miscellaneous fine cloth, strengthening the market. Next month's "Colorful Ball Yang Crane" opened at 45.25 yuan. Spot prices for "Four Gentlemen" serge from yellow warehouses rose to 1.46 yuan per yard, falling slightly by 0.05 yuan at closing. Futures also increased to 1.53 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Woolen Fabric Orders Continue to Be Transacted <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Recently, transactions in woolen fabrics have been quite active. Merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, Nanjing, Ningbo, and other places have been actively purchasing. Tailors on this street have also made transactions. Popular patterns include thin flannel, "Wanliding" French flannel, "Bale" flannel, yellow twill, white canvas, "Pali Si," "Harvey" flannel, linen cloth, and "Yu Sha" flannel. Due to brisk market sales, woolen fabric shops are also placing orders with foreign companies. It is reported that most orders are for Japanese goods, with shipping scheduled for the near future due to the war situation.</p>
<h3 id="e108">The Shanghai Woolen Fabric Industry After the Second European War <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Since the "January 28th Incident," Shanghai's woolen fabric industry, during the war period, once encountered an unprecedented crisis. Those in Hongkou were mostly destroyed by artillery fire, while businesses in the central districts were completely shut down. However, with the internal shift of the war and the gradual increase in population, Shanghai's various industries, including the woolen fabric industry, trended towards a distorted prosperity. Especially because woolen fabrics are also imported goods, since the government implemented foreign exchange controls and import restrictions last year, and with the outbreak of the Second European War, foreign manufacturing and exports became difficult, the Shanghai woolen fabric industry, which had relatively abundant stocks, has shown a trend of "rapid development."</p>
<p>For example, at present, woolen fabric prices are only increasing. Regardless of foreign exchange fluctuations, the biggest reason is due to the continuous increase in foreign prices. For example, the price of "Yu Sha" thin flannel, which was previously four or five shillings per yard, rose to six or seven shillings per yard at the beginning of this year, and today it is confirmed by telegram that it will be ten shillings. Other woolen fabrics such as overcoat wool have also increased in price. However, given the fact that Shanghai woolen fabric prices are increasing by the day (this situation is most prevalent in the Qipan Street area), the large-scale buying and monopolistic manipulation by some woolen fabric hoarders cannot be ignored.

<p>Wu Shengfangshi, residing outside Fengshan Gate in Hangzhou, his father suddenly suffered from a debilitating illness last autumn and was bedridden. He deeply regretted not seeing his daughter-in-law. Therefore, the family chose last month for Wu to get married. Unexpectedly, on the eve of the wedding ceremony, his father passed away. Thus, a wedding and funeral were held together. Someone wrote a poem for the occasion: "Tree lamps and flower candles shine brightly, The Old Man Under the Moon and Impermanence are each busy, Cries and sobs will enter the coffin, The sound of drums and trumpets wants to return to the bridal chamber. The new bride is helped to pay respects to the new ghost, Wedding wine is poured to celebrate the joyous mourning, A child under the flowers will be conceived in one try, Next year, mourning clothes will be worn to hold the grandson."</p>

<p>Xin Linxi petitioned the public court for a divorce. Magistrate Sun ordered the case to be transferred to the county for review, which Xin sought to avoid, as he believed the transfer would involve significant expenses. Magistrate Sun instructed that the case be sent directly from the public court, so the bailiffs would not dare to extort money, assuring him he could be at ease. However, after Mo County Judge summoned and questioned them, he still ordered Xin to take Li back. If she were to run away again, only Hu Er would be held responsible, and Hu was instructed to submit a written guarantee on record. Unexpectedly, after the judgment, the county bailiff privately detained Xin, while Li was handed over to an official matchmaker. Xin's brother, upon hearing this, shouted at the county office. Only then did the bailiff release Xin. Before Xin's brother shouted his grievance, the bailiff asked Xin for money, but Xin told him that he was completely penniless. The bailiff then asked if he knew anyone who could vouch for him. Xin only knew of someone named Su. The bailiff happily invited Su, and after much discussion, Su agreed to provide a pair of eyeglasses. This was because, colloquially, two silver dollars were called "a pair of eyeglasses." The bailiff was still not satisfied. Later, upon hearing that Xin's brother had come to complain, fearing that the officials would find out, he quickly released him. The other day, the bailiff went to a tea house in the French Concession to find Su and ask for the money. Su said, "When did I ever promise you any money?" The bailiff said, "Didn't you promise me a pair of eyeglasses?" Su then burst out laughing, saying, "You also want to make a fortune from this kind of case? You have no discernment. I just wanted to give you a pair of eyeglasses, but it seems you still haven't realized it."</p>

<h3 id="e111">Faithfulness in Small Things (2) <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Let us look at the natural world. The power of small things is truly great! Is the grass not small? Yet, because of God's power helping it, over time, it grows out from under the bedrock. Is water not weak? A child can easily flick it away with a finger. Yet, because of God's power helping it, it effortlessly carries thousands of tons of iron ships, as if they were floating duckweed. Is air not the lightest? Yet, because of God's power helping it, its power is sufficient to topple trees and houses. Therefore, we must never underestimate small things. We are inherently extremely weak and incapable, but God can empower us, just as He empowers those weak things. Therefore, we should not think that we cannot do things. We, in ourselves, certainly cannot, but through God, who strengthens us, we feel that we can do all things. Once, a large stone was thrown into a certain harbor. Many years later, due to the obstruction of this stone, the silt accumulating in this area gradually increased, and eventually, it became a small island. Everyone, see how a small stone has such great power! Paul said, "When I am weak, then I am strong." This saying is indeed true, because relying on one's own intelligence and ability will never withstand the power of the devil. We must know our own weakness, know that we cannot overcome the world, lust, and the temptations of the devil. Then, we turn to God and sincerely pray for His power, and we can become strong. In short, we should always remember to be faithful in small things, to be cautious in small things, to always know our own weakness, and to always seek God's power to be given to us. Then, we can be strong, and God will entrust us with great things to manage. (The End) For detailed research, please write to P.O. Box 1227.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Scientists at War with Insects <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Lan Hu</p>
<p>As the weather gets warmer, the active period for insects has arrived again. The reproductive capacity of insects is truly astonishing. Take the most common fly, for example: a fly can reproduce four times, with each laying between one hundred and two hundred eggs. From spring to autumn, they can reproduce about ten generations. Counting 400 eggs per fly, each fly can reproduce countless millions in a year.</p>
<p>Strange Phenomenon</p>
<p>Some may ask: "If insects reproduce so quickly, it is definitely impossible for human power to eradicate them. If this continues, won't insects fill the whole world? But since there has been life on Earth, tens of millions of years have passed. Why hasn't the number of various insects increased?"</p>
<p>Indeed, this is a strange phenomenon. According to research by entomologists, it is believed that every kind of insect has a parasite that lives on it, absorbing nutrients from the insect's body and excreting toxins. Insects often die as a result. In the summer, you can find many insect corpses piled up in corners or on windowsills; these corpses are the achievements of those tiny parasites.</p>
<p>Insect Army</p>
<p>Recently, humans have applied this principle to resist epidemics and famines. All insects that transmit diseases and harm plants are the objects of human warfare. The United States has factories that specialize in raising parasites that live on various insects, implementing a mass production system in order to fight with insects. Everyone knows that the United States currently has nearly one million motorized regular troops, but few people know that the United States currently has trillions of insect regular troops at war with insects!</p>
<p>However, insects also have their own methods of reproduction. They can take advantage of merchants to go to places thousands of miles away, where there are no mortal enemies—parasites. They can reproduce freely there, causing serious disasters in a short time. However, scientists will certainly not allow insects to continue to be rampant. Scientists often form a group and set off to deep mountains and dense forests thousands of miles away to find valuable parasites.</p>
<p>Ten Thousand Mile Long March</p>
<p>Once, there was an insect plague in the western United States, and hundreds of square miles of wheat were eaten up by a certain kind of insect. Scientists began to study all kinds of things about this insect. They discovered that the reason for its reproduction was that there were no parasites to prevent its reproduction, so they had to go to find its old nest. As a result of the search, they knew that it had spread from Australia. So they organized a search team to Australia to find parasites. This work is also quite difficult, because parasites cannot be seen with the human eye, so they have to capture the insect and take the parasites from its body. But there are many parasites in the old nest of the insect, and the insect is not easy to reproduce, so it is not easy to find, often walking hundreds of square miles and still not finding it. Moreover, the area is often full of jungles and swamps, and the climate is harsh, and scientists who are unaccustomed to the climate often get sick as a result.</p>
<p>Extremely Thrilling</p>
<p>I remember once when a team of scientists was collecting parasites in Africa, a large herd of elephants suddenly rushed towards them. The team members could not avoid them, and many tools were damaged; more than once, a lion secretly crawled into the camp at night. The team members fired shots, but unexpectedly angered the lion, which roared and jumped around, destroying everything in the camp, and the tents almost collapsed, and many scientists were also injured as a result. When friends asked them why they were injured, they often liked to answer like this: "Isn't it because of these little things?"</p>
<p>After these little things are brought to the United States, they must first be inspected by scientists and doctors. If it is found that this kind of insect is harmful to the human body, they must be poisoned to death. It is only allowed to be cultivated if the inspection is non-toxic. The breeding room is similar to a flower greenhouse, with sunlight coming in from above, made of glass, and there is a dark passage outside the door; there is a lamp in the middle, and when the door is opened, the lamp goes out by itself. The insect nature is towards the light, so they do not want to fly out, which is to prevent them from rushing out of the door. Afterwards, they are divided and raised in various rooms with different temperatures and humidity to see under what circumstances they reproduce the fastest, and then this situation is used as a standard to implement mass production.</p>

<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>A happy life, a sound personality, perfect intelligence, and a strong physique are obtained through struggle. If you want to have fun, you should work harder. To enjoy, you must first suffer. We learn humility from failure and disaster.</p>
<p>A fulfilling life is a life of hard work and effort, not only mental labor but also physical labor. If you want to be happy and content, both are indispensable. Ease exceeding effort will definitely lead to nothing.</p>
<p>But, beware of "hope," beware of "ambition." Moderation is naturally beneficial. Too much negligence will lead to failure. "Hope" makes you indulge until you are defeated, because you have been living in sweet and boundless fantasies. "Ambition" can destroy your body.</p>
<p>Work brings experience, experience combines with knowledge, and time gives you a reward. What is more satisfying than the joy after completing work? What knowledge is more practical than that produced by experience? A turbulent life cultivates a strong character.</p>
<p>Hard work is the foundation of a nation and also the capital for seeking happiness.</p>
<p>Only those who are full of energy, willing to work, focused, capable, brave, generous, and upright can enjoy a fulfilling life.</p>

<p>Miss Shen Yingjun, a famous socialite in Shanghai, usually goes in and out of major dance halls and theaters. She is good at socializing, so her boyfriends secretly give her a lot of cosmetics, as well as shoes, fabrics, and other accessories. Some even pay for her meals and rent, but if you want to pursue a certain relationship with her, she is as cold as ice and resolutely refuses. One morning, the newspaper suddenly published that she and Mr. Lu Aijie had begun cohabiting. As a result, the servants who cared about her were all talking about it. Later, after her two best friends, Mr. Tang, told me, according to Miss Shen, "The reason for living with Mr. Lu is nothing more than loving Mr. Lu's appearance. Just talking about clothes, no matter how clean they are, they are not as clean as his!" Because Mr. Lu has a special characteristic: that is, he must take his clothes to the West Shanghai Dry Cleaning Store in West Shanghai every day to be cleaned. At the same time, for their convenience, they also live in the West Shanghai Dry Cleaning Store at 1601 Jing'an Temple Road. When they moved in on the first day, many spectators swarmed outside, all carrying their dirty clothes as gifts for them. In an instant, the red curtains behind were crowded. Afterwards, it was heard that the spectators who cared about them felt 120,000 points satisfied. They all felt that they had added a lot of beauty to their faces with spring breeze, and they said in unison: "The West Shanghai Dry Cleaning Store's cleaning of clothes is really the best in Shanghai, and you can't find a second one."</p>

<h3 id="e115">Reading Should Have a Goal <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Sheng</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the purpose of reading is definitely not just to fill the brain, but to apply the knowledge gained to daily affairs. "Learning for application" has become a timeless and unbreakable good saying.</p>
<p>Although "application" is our ultimate goal in reading, simply thinking about learning something practical does not contribute to reading efficiency. The scope of learning is the most vast and boundless. If you grab here and there without any plan, the result is often that you feel a lack of interest in any books, resulting in nothing.</p>
<p>Therefore, when reading, we need a goal that is relatively small and practical. For example, when reading history, we can prepare to tell stories to children after reading. When reading literature and poetry, we can sing them like songs and recite them with friends. When reading psychology, we can practice how to improve memory. When reading electricity, we can plan to build a radio. With such a concrete goal closely related to daily life, readers will feel an urgent need to acquire knowledge, thus developing interest, knowing what to choose, and achieving practical results.</p>
<p>Young people often recognize reading as a painful thing. Old-fashioned education uses punishment to bring them too close to books, and the effect is ultimately temporary. If scholars read for a certain concrete goal, then in order to solve the current problem, they will concentrate on studying with relish. Not only will they not lack interest, but also in order to achieve their goal, they will definitely have perseverance.</p>
<p>Learning should be like a pyramid, broad but also deep. It is a difficult thing to be both broad and deep. A concrete goal will help us solve this difficulty. A book will never have value in every word from beginning to end, and the evaluation of value varies from person to person. If we read without a goal, then after reading a book, we only feel that it is ordinary everywhere and cannot extract the essence. Only after setting a concrete goal can we distinguish what is what I belong to and what is worthless to me. In this way, we can select and arrange the existing materials in an orderly manner before we can talk about application.</p>
<p>Unless scholars have a clear goal, reading is not easy to achieve results. Reading for entertainment gets the effect of entertainment, reading for recreation gets the effect of recreation. Reading to solve a certain problem or achieve a certain purpose has the effect of solving this problem or achieving this purpose. If you pick up a book and read a few words at random, then who dares to determine its effect? Therefore, only with a goal can there be an effect. The goal is the bridge to achieving practical results; in other words, it is a means of "learning for application."</p>
<p>Life is a life of learning, and reading is only a microcosm of life learning. Usually, our observation and research of anything should have a goal, and its value is no different from reading with a goal. Remember, develop the habit of always having a special goal. The goal is the bridge to success.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Dream of a Camel's Spirit <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Wuxin</p>
<p>Several photographs of camels, sent by a friend from afar a few days ago, stirred in my mind a distant dream of camels and a beautiful homeland.</p>
<p>When I was a child in my hometown, every morning and evening, the crisp sound of the camel bells and the creaking of the waterwheel harmoniously sang a song of labor around our house; reminding people of the camel caravans in the vast desert, with many heavy things on their mountain-like backs, hurrying on their way.</p>
<p>At that time, my grandfather was still alive. I remember: on a cold winter night, the whole family gathered around the fireplace for a chat. The blazing fire permeated the ink-black curtain around us; reflecting the old man's kind face, full of the marks of life's trials, revealing some complacency and satisfaction. His silver-haired mustache covered his mouth, and he puffed on his dry tobacco pipe, blowing out thick white smoke in bursts, making everyone's vision a little blurred. He slowly and hoarsely said, with a hint of instruction:</p>
<p>"My child, when you grow up, you must be like a camel," he coughed heavily a few times, and knocked his dry tobacco pipe against the fireplace. His bright eyes shone on my face, "They can carry such heavy things for people, cross such distant and dry deserts and wildernesses... Regardless of wind and rain, without feeling a bit of pain or frustration; this is the 'camel's spirit' that you should have in the future. You must cultivate this spirit now, so that you can take on heavy responsibilities in the future. Don't be lazy. Time is more precious than money. My child, remember these words..."</p>
<p>Every time I saw camels and heard the sound of copper bells, my grandfather's loving face and this long string of sincere words vividly, like surging waves, poured into my mind, causing me to feel a burst of trembling, bewilderment, and shame. However, I also remember that I am still young. I cannot help but muster courage again - move forward! Young people should gallop like camels on the fiery fields of the motherland.</p>
<p>However, there are too few camels on the desolate "isolated island." Some young people cannot see camels, nor can they hear the crisp sound of copper bells, and even forget their shadows. They live a peaceful life, like stagnant water lying in a pond.</p>
<p>Ah, I have a dream of a camel's spirit.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Drama and Resonance <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>At the most wonderful point of a drama, the actors and the audience often merge into one, sharing the same spirit. In the realm of perfection, the actors completely forget themselves, and the audience has nothing else in mind. The old actors' saying, "The actor is crazy, the audience is stupid," can symbolize the stage and the audience at that moment, united in spirit, and then the resonance of the drama is complete, and the effect of the drama is complete.</p>
<p>Resonance is different from nonsense. True resonance in the theater is not easy to obtain, while nonsense resonance is easily found in song and dance halls. For example, in a play, a flower thief forces a female character to undress, and wants her to undress again, but the female character hesitates. Then the actor playing the flower thief suddenly asks the audience, "Do you think she should undress?" Many people in the audience actually respond by saying, "Undress, undress!" Or, when depicting a widow longing for spring, she always acts as if she is tossing and turning and cannot fall asleep. The audience then shouts loudly, "Can't sleep tonight!" And the actors actually respond on stage with lewd voices, saying, "Do you think I can sleep?" This kind of phenomenon, the stage and the audience are indeed united, but it destroys the atmosphere of the theater, and the fervent solemnity of true resonance cannot be compared. This is the fault of both the actors and the audience!</p>
<p>It is known that the relationship between drama and resonance often depends on the cultural level of the actors and the audience. In remote areas with low cultural standards, such as the Chuntai Opera performances in my hometown in the past, the singing and dialogue of Lady Sun and Zhang Fei in "Intercepting the River and Seizing the Battle" were so vulgar that one could not bear to listen to them. For example, Zhang sang: "A loud curse nourishes the Han essence, where are you going with that prostitute?" Lady Sun then sang: "Hearing your words, my anger rises, I scold my third brother, you old turtle son, because my mother is sick, so I called you to take me back home, I can't handle the child, you shouldn't talk nonsense!" "Enough, enough, let it go! I'll be cruel and bite you, and give the little bastard to the old turtle son!" This wonderful passage was the most exciting part of the whole play. Both of them had a lot of body movements, and their singing and acting were very energetic. The audience was so focused and breathless that they thought it was a supreme performance. The stage and the audience were united. If they were replaced with elegant words, wouldn't they be stunned and speechless, as if lost in a fog? If people like us heard it, wouldn't we cover our faces and leave?</p>
<p>Today, in the Shanghai Peking Opera Theater, although there are fewer nonsensical phenomena like the former, there are still many cases where the script and the audience's level are incompatible. Sometimes the play itself can only cater to the lower classes, or the audience cannot understand the mission of the drama, so they exaggerate it, distort it, or make harsh demands, or indulge it. As a result, there is rarely true resonance between the stage and the audience. Cheers, applause, and boos are all mixed together, which is ridiculous!</p>
<h3 id="e119">The Inside Story of the "Rumor" about Chen Yunshang <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Regarding the rumor that Chen Yunshang "had an abortion and died," the Hai Xing News Agency published a statement by Gong Zhifang, the Propaganda Minister, on the second day, and the rumor was dispelled. At that time, in order to obtain a more detailed report, this newspaper sent a telegram to its Hong Kong correspondent, and received a detailed reply yesterday; briefly stating that the rumor originated from a Cantonese newspaper published in Hong Kong, which fabricated such a rumor on April 1st, "April Fool's Day," but corrected it the next day. As for Chen Yunshang's arrival in Shanghai, it may be delayed until around the 5th of next month due to the intense work on "The Merry Empress."</p>
<p>Due to the occurrence of this rumor, I thought about the situation of the Hong Kong film industry. In the past, the Hong Kong film industry was surrounded by pornography and horror. Before Chen Yunshang came to Shanghai, she also made those pornographic films, so the Cantonese newspaper that sensationalized readers with yellow news made a joke about Chen Yunshang's arrival. However, I remember that when "Mulan Joins the Army" was released, Chen Yunshang said in an interview with a newspaper reporter that she would make more meaningful films in the future. However, both times she returned to Hong Kong, she was "rushing to film" under the sponsorship of the giants, which made the audience in Hong Kong and Shanghai have two different impressions of Chen Yunshang. As in the case of this rumor, the Cantonese newspaper should be fully responsible for the prank, but when "rushing to film" in the future, she should also choose the script carefully. This is not only a personal hope for Chen Yunshang, but also a sincere advice to the entire South China film industry.</p>
<p>It is really inappropriate to ask for help through improper means. Think about it, there are six or seven members of the examination committee. If each person recommends six or seven people, they can gather enough twenty men and women in one day. Why bother spending money like advertising fees to post recruitment notices in the newspaper? Since you have posted recruitment notices in the newspaper, you naturally hope to select some real talents from the society to enrich the future film industry. If each of us examination committee members wants to be worthy of all the applicants, the company that entrusted us to conduct the examination, and the entire film industry, we must not have any intention of cheating. Therefore, trying to ask for help through improper means is completely self-deceptive.</p>
<p>The proper preparation is that, in addition to completing the direct application procedures, the applicants should first give themselves some psychological training.</p>
<p>First, ask yourself if you meet the stated qualifications? According to my personal experience, training for six months, any subject can</p>
<h3 id="e120">Preparation for the Xinhua Training Class Examination <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Dabei</p>
<p>Since the Xinhua Company's establishment of a film acting training class and its recruitment announcement were published in the newspapers, because I am also one of the members of the examination committee, the number of letters and phone calls I have received asking for help has been particularly large in the past few days, and I have really had no time to answer them. I am taking advantage of a little space in the "Entertainment World" to share my thoughts with everyone, so that everyone can discover and prepare. The most important thing is to calm down. To be honest, you can achieve very significant results in only six months of training in other subjects. However, six months is very limited for Mandarin Chinese. Therefore, people who cannot speak Mandarin fluently should not waste their time. If there are no problems with Mandarin Chinese and other qualifications, you have a great chance to try.</p>
<p>Second, the so-called "sacrificing your appearance" has a very profound meaning in the performing arts. Without the determination to sacrifice, you will not be able to use your body freely, which is the most important tool. Once you have made up your mind, the first thing you must overcome is the fear and timidity that you have gradually cultivated since you were a baby. This kind of psychology is very popular with judges in court. However, it is absolutely useless in the examination room for film actors. To put it bluntly, if you don't have the courage to sacrifice your appearance, why bother wasting other people's precious time?</p>
<p>The psychological training of encouraging yourself to bravely take the exam is the proper preparation that I hope for from the applicants. To break through the illusion, let me tell you that the "promises to help as much as possible within the impossible range" that the examination committee members make vaguely on the phone are all "nonsense." Don't believe them!</p>
