<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c4">這三個月 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>英日間緬甸禁運協定已經東京倫敦兩地證實，協定內所定英政府須禁止武器子彈汽油運貨汽車及鐵路材料，經緬甸運入中國，以三個月爲期，而始於昨日七月十八，尤見得締結協定還是昨日以前的事情。</p>
<p>英國外交當局在他們議院內，對於本問題無所說明，亦不作强辯，默然接受議員們『可恥！』『實屬可恥！』的唾駡。英國一般人士對此協定，表示憤慨的不一而足；而若干英國人士則謂；滇緬公路即使被封鎖三個月，對於軍火並無多大影響；因爲該公路在七八九三個月輒爲猛烈的熱帶雨所侵襲，不能行駛卡車；且國民政府早有未雨綢繆之計，預儲軍火甚充足，故不致礙及抗戰云云。此類說明，所根據的事實自屬可信；蓋七八九月是西南雨季，而三五個月內抗戰所需軍火決非依恃這三個月的滇緬公路運輸。但事實儘事實，絕對不能作爲英國背棄條的道義的原諒；故國民政府强硬抗議，辭嚴義正，自有顚撲不破的論據，却不因爲抗戰軍火受了嚴重影響而抗議。簡單言之；直接利害所關不大，而是非所在當然必爭。</p>
<p>在是非上，不容藐視這三個月的停運；更從別方面加以檢討，則這三個月實爲國際極端重要的時期，而英國的簽訂這協定，祗暴露了卑怯愚蠢而已。云何國際極端重要時期？其一，德義兩國對於英國，將立即有所發動。假定所發動的，是附有和平條件的重要提議，則事前即不應斷言爲英國所權衡利害而絕對不能接受；假定所發動的是陸空海三軍總攻勢，則事前亦即不應斷言爲英國所强毅抗禦而絕對不能退敵。目前的德國，自從連克波蘭挪威盧森堡荷蘭比利時法蘭西之後，且義大利參戰，羅馬尼亞變志相從，非復侷促中歐的德國可比，不虞被封鎖而資源竭蹶，漸次備具久戰的條件了，但其作戰計畫還是速戰速決；並傳元首希特勒，有七月下旬勝英奏凱的豪語。目前的英國，雖孤軍奮鬥，而朝野迭次表示長期抗戰的決心，首相邱吉爾及其閣僚，允吐氣如虹；然至少以滇緬通運問題爲例，可以證明英國很可能的有如神龍而見首不見尾；况現代的立體戰術允非往年平面的陣地戰可比，無論攻勢守勢，易分勝敗。因此之故，吾們深深感覺得英德戰爭雖氣勢宏偉，但即在十這三個月內竟得結束，並非意外。</p>
<p>第二，中日發動戰爭後，日本四倒其閣，現在近衛又來了。這以事實說明日本國內政情的不安，姑勿申論；然近衛再任首相，在其主觀上務望解決日本人所謂中國事變，則所昌言不諱，原來日本什客觀條件上，亦自非謀停止侵略，解決戰爭不可，再不解決，日本如何支撑？近衛知何維持，如何下臺？故這一次推出近衛，乃至於所謂「新體制」，實是日本方面的最後一着。惟其如此，近衛上臺後，對國內，對中國，對其他各國，在經濟上，在外交上，在軍事上，必竭其所剩餘的全力，作別開生面的新策動。策動的方向與內容，今日不必多所推論，即以英日關係爲例，無論緬甸停運協定所規定，祗是英國片面的屈服義務，即使有如英國一部份人所『吹聽』，謂別有交換，謂別有默契，然近衛對英國，謂將受這一協定的拘束，將以這一協定爲改善英日關係的基礎，則普天之下，除英國人，決不如此想法。於是推測，這三個月，在日本發動其最後一着之後，國際必須準備變局的來臨。</p>
<p>第三，國際動盪，瞬息幻變，昨今更有大可注意者三端；美國十一月間競選總統，羅斯福是否破例三選三任，是美國以及世界有關的絕大問題；昨夜芝加哥電訊，民主黨已將羅氏列入候選名單了。蘇聯在巴爾幹方面自羅馬尼亞屈服後，似與德義相默契而靜止；但昨夜消息，蘇聯軍隊又進佔羅國十二村；欲知後事，且待靜觀。西班牙忍耐已久，而地中海咽喉直布羅陀港久歸英人掌握，自爲西人所沒齒不忘；乃昨日由西國元首弗朗哥公開要求收回。這三事，皆將於三個月內發酵。</p>
<p>中國抗戰，方在膠着之下，穩定之中，大舉反攻，雖未必即在目前，却亦爲期不遠；但英國的這三個月，則必遭遇空前嚴重的試騐。三個月後，商決緬甸運輸問題的人，究竟是誰，目前亦不妨留爲疑問；屆時由中國參加研討，亦是極合理的現象，極合理的發展！</p>
<p>日關於斷絕滇緬交通之談判，在法理上實有顯著之區別、况中日兩國均未正式宜戰也、國務卿復稱、交戰國間之封鎖乃國際公法所承認者、而經由非交戰領土私有路綫者、則另有條款規定、交戰國家一經宣佈其交戰權、卽在海上享有禁運法律、並得依法截阻貨品及干涉任何非中立行動、至於私有通路則復有完全不同之規條定之、頃間中英經由香港及緬甸公路交通之新限制、對於美國之重要、已由商務部之報吿中加以指明、該報告謂、五月份中香港輸出桐油的達二百萬磅、其中有一百六十九萬磅係運入美國、僅有二十四寓九千磅桐油運入歐洲、商務部官員謂至於滇緬公路方面、則無從獲得統計、（十八日合衆社電）</p>
<p>薛西爾爵士在上院希望政府審愼將事</p>
<p>倫敦　薜西爾動爵昨在上院稱、渠固不欲此時使政府爲難、然有不得不言者、卽對日談判已引起大部份公衆之焦慮是也、外傳有人利用英國勢力謀中日和平之說、殊堪主意、故渠請政府審愼進行、至於封閉緬甸公路事、渠希望政府極端愼重將事、免作類似助日抑華之舉動、薛氏維稱、「吾人許緬甸路由私人或其他方面、用以輸運將售與中國、或業已售與中國之貨物、此實無所謂有背中立、貿易道路之尋常使用、固吾人所應享有者也、吾人皆承認情况甚為嚴重、余極願不妨礙政府採行其認爲可减少大局嚴重性之任何步驟、惟余請政府考慮顯然在威脅下對日讓步、是否可减輕此嚴重性、吾人所須老慮者、不僅爲吾人動靜之重大與立卽結果、亦當爲戰局最後勝利所繫之最後結果」云、外相哈立法克斯答稱、此時渠不能與薛氏辯論、但若薜氏或其他上議員以爲、政府對此嚴重事件未嘗注意、則渠殊爲扼腕、渠希望明日可向上院作較詳細之陳述、上院可靜待之云、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　工黨議員興威爾、昨在下院請外次白特勒、以毫無疑義之詞句、說明英國固亟願避免對日衝突、然不欲屈意奉承日本、白特勒答稱、渠希望行將潑表之詳細言論、可解釋政府關於此事之政策而使下院滿意、故渠此時不欲有所陳說云、（十八日路透社電要</p>
<p>英著名評論家主張召集五强舉行會議</p>
<p>倫敦　新聞紀事報今日載國際事務著名評論家巴特萊特之建議、主張召集五强會議、討論遠東問題、據謂美國務卿赫爾之宣言、足以表示更勇敢更莊嚴處置該問題之途徑、赫爾所處之地位、當知英國不獲援助、而以武力保衛緬甸公路將如何困難、有關之列强英·美·蘇·中·日·五國舉行會議、此殊有外交上可能性、日人亦知英國之困難、現有種種理由、可信日本新政府甚至將較前政府更堅持其要求、惟彼等亦知日本今日所處之地位不能由戰　擴大而增大收獲、彼等苟非能獲泰西列强之接濟品、不能擊敗中國、彼等知華人現甚堅決、不容中國任何部份爲日本所有、故願見獨立的中國與美英蘇三國相互討論、或可覓得能使日軍稍得讓步退出中國，不喪顏面、且獲蔣委員長贊同之解決辦法云、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>日外省發言人猶謂協定尙非極度滿意</p>
<p>東京　外務省發言人、今日答覆關於英日緬甸公路協定之問話謂、此非極度滿意云、今後三個月緬甸公路正當雨季、運輸或不甚多、但發言人希望雨季過後、運輸漸繁時、該路中止戰品運輸將更加嚴、有問及英國抗議日本中止華中與華南海岸之航運者、發言人答稱、渠見某報會載此訊、並謂日本之新行動、乃以軍事上絕對必要爲根據、各國航運商必須承認大規模之軍事行動刻正在中國進行中、此事實英法兩國均已承認、故第三國之船隻、今以不圖駛近華中華南劃定區域爲妥、至於劃定區域內有避風之要港　處、發言人謂氣候可以豫測、將至之颶風趨何方向、一經測知、各船卽可豫作必要之防備云、（十八日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日海軍省發言人、詳述美國務卿反對封閉緬甸公路之宣言云、日本之政策「將不爲第三者僅有之口頭姿態」所影響云、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>中國運輸車輛開始移往西北公路應用</p>

<p>法租界沿華界之新開河·新橋街·南陽橋·三處鐵門、開放已歷多時、詎於昨晨起、均一律封閉、南市與法租界之女通、全吿斷絕、南市居民之欲入租界者、均須繞道浦東、是以各掄渡均利市三倍、至法當局突將各鐵門加以封閉之原因、係因法商電車公司銅匠間之念工風潮有關、據悉法當局偵悉此次怠工工人、大多居住南市、且有開會醞釀擴大之傳聞、法捕房爲維持公用事業及界內秩序、不得不暫予封閉、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>談判決裂　相率怠工</p>
<p>法租界呂班路二四九號法商電車公司機務處銅匠間全體工友七百餘人、近以生計維艱、曾於日前向公司方面提出加薪三成要求、惟據勞方消息、則謂勞方之要求、係米價超出五十元時、所超出數目、山資方津貼、而資方僅允超出五十元、由資方津貼四元五角、因之雙方意見紛歧、遷延未決、勞方乃限資方於前日下午三時前答覆、但資方堅提昨日下午五時談判、勞方遂於前日午後二時許相率怠工、</p>
<p>電車汽車照常行駛</p>
<p>該管捕房聞訊後、立遣大批探捕前　維持秩序、罷工工友乃悉數離開公司、至外傳怠工者係該公司之司機人、因之前晚法商各路電車及二十一路二十二路公共汽車、均曾一度停駛一小時等說、並非事實、又據平明社記者昨向公司方面探悉、參加罷工之工友、多數寓居於南市、且彼輩在罷工後、均紛赴南市集議、且有參加所謂「工人福利會」消息、</p>
<p>邊界鐵門全部封閉是以公司方面爲防止公司內其他部分工友或被勾引及其他意外事端計、業於昨晨與法租界警務當局商妥、將所有毘連於南市邊界之法租界鐵鬥、如南陽橋·新橋街·新開河·等各處、悉數於昨晨七時半起暫予關閉、停止通行、致有若干希圖通行者咸被禁於鐵門內外、無法通過云、據警務當局消息、該項關閉、須至該項工潮完全解決後、方予恢復、故預料數日內、法租界與南市交通、一時未能恢復、</p>
<p>捕房採取嚴密戒備自法商電車公司銅匠問工人罷工後、法租界當局因恐有妨害治安之行動、當於呂班路電車公司附近舉行嚴密戒備、見康悌路電車公司側門處、停有鐵甲車一輛、法華巡捕四名、荷槍守衛、大門前亦停有鐵甲車輛一、並有法華巡捕二十餘名嚴密守衛形勢相當緊張、自銅匠工人罷工後、該公司待修車輛甚多、而每日尙有車輛必須修理後、始能行駛者、今亦因此而擱置、</p>
<p>公司方面所抱態度</p>
<p>公司職員認為此次工潮、純係一種政治之發展、故主張經理部對於工人增加工資與米貼之要求、應保持堅決不屈之態度、此輩職員指明電車公司經理部以前曾表示對於工人所提出仕何合理之要求、準備予以考慮、祇須此等要求之動機爲眞正之需要、而出之以和平之方法、但在上次三個月之前、接受工人所提出大部份之要求時、據稱、公司當局曾向工人警告、凡受政治黨派之鼓動而向經理部纏擾、必將遭受碰壁云、查此次工潮最初發動之時、加入罷工者、僅工人二百名、而現已擴至七百人、惟司機·賣票·及查票等、均未參加、故公共汽車與電車之服務、仍得照常進行、</p>
<p>發縱指使另有其人</p>
<p>據該公司職員稱、此次罷工之掀起、實受某方唆使、公司經理斐弗利對於此項消息、旣不證實、亦不否認、但稱現在罷工中之工人七百名、其堅持其「過甚之要求」、則法租界之公共汽車與電車、在不到二星期之後、將有全部停頓之可能、斐氏謂、法商電車公司之工人、所得之工資、並不遜於本埠各大行號所僱之工人、而今經理部與工人代表之談判、已吿決裂、</p>
<p>求新船廠昨亦罷工</p>
<p>南市滬軍營機廠街法商求新造船廠全體工人、爲表示援助法商水電仝人起見、亦於昨晨起一致行動、同時該處機廠街、尙有法商水電公司之自來水亭機器廠、爲汲取黄浦水源、接管灌通法租界蘆家灣總水匯櫃、佻給法租界全區用戶、頗屬重要、故廠方已另雇法俄工匠輪替工作、俾免中輟、而在法國花園地底層早已建成儲水池、足供多時之需、</p>

<p>紗市平靜、大勢不離盤旋之境、此因浙閩沿海口岸被封鎖之後、浙東方面運輸完全停駛、紗銷去路大受影響、惟華南香港裝運艱難、現改小港口轉往內地而去、所以香港幫稍有零碎額子採辦交易矣、人心安定、多頭不急於了結、市盤尤見寗靜、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因海外棉市不振、及外滙無甚變遷、市象平淡、二十支雙馬開小盤爲九百三十五元、比上日跌五六元、旋後微跌至九百三十二元、在三十五六元之價徘徊甚久、繼聞香港幫實銷稍形購辦、較上日爲活絡、買氣見濃、徐徐上升、漲至九百四十八元、收盤時又復回疲、查半日間成交統計一千八百十包、行情二十支雙馬漲三元、今日有紗一百八十件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初先因多頭之了結及大衆之賣出、續後又因華爾街之軟弱、結果收盤價格近期漲十七及二十七磅音、遠期則降七八磅音、印度昨日連開預測降落七八羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來尙稱熱鬧、廠方存底微薄、購意甚濃、但以紗價未能猛騰、故祗絡續稍有購辦而已、故一般者預料、原棉因到貨日稀、今後更將看好也、</p>

<p>國布　昨市續疲、乃因銷路太仄、囤戶進意懈怠、售價逐步盤小、白貨粗細斜紋每疋又跌二角半至五角、漂染布尙少軒輊、蘇浙內地各路需要較殷、故本街批發交易頗盛、成交各布三百數十件、粤港幫辦色布色斜細布斜紋等貨二百餘件、北路烟台幫辦斜紋絨色布色斜等一百數十件、</p>
<p>東布　市盤平穩、惟龍頭細布因增加棧租、又有新舊棧單之分、晨開新棧單一度升至二十九元七角、收盤時二十九元六角、老棧單盤旋於二十八元八九角之間、四君子嗶嘰每碼八角六分二厘半至六分半、而中擋細布及細斜走銷仍呆、亦鮮售開、</p>

<p>糯米去路雖亦不暢、但市貨無多、較能站住、僅有三四角之上落、計開金溧特元六十三元二角、六十二元七角、常丹白元六十一元左右、不過香港洋糯因與國貨情形較有不同、惟洋米爲馬首是瞻、所以際斯疲境爲準則市綫計、遂祗開六十元五十九元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米到貨仍有千餘包、而塲外暗盤交易、傳聞依然寥落、貨主搬運不易、與夫身本着想、仍在堅持、買價高貨亦僅略降半元光景、次貨似較貶重、常幫特淸粳六十六七元、崑常蘇白粳高自六十五六元、次至宿貨六十元、靑泗薄稻六十五六元、次至六十二三元、南港早稻六十一元、六十元、斛見五十七八元云、</p>

<p>麪粉昨日疲軟不振、因銷街需要、一動卽退、客本如華北方面、均受洋粉傾銷影響、更無開展之望、內地粉旣可源源來申、與日廠粉同時競賣、故市面虛弱、統市僅開八月份鳳凰粉一千餘包、價爲十五元、比前再小一角、其他內地雜牌粉價亦暗鬆、惟華廠粉則以原料嚴受統制、不易購買、廠盤仍爲十六元原價、兩廠批出約有七八千包、</p>

<p>彼得曾奉主耶蘇的名，令一個瘸腿的人起來行走，同他進入聖殿，媲美真神。現在世界上有許多人是瘸了腿，需要扶助的手，拉他們起來，好崇拜神，讚美神。彼得是做了這事，就被當地的官長審問；他就將這事歸榮主耶蘇，他說：「站在你們面前的這人得痊癒，是因爲你們所釘在十字架神叫他從死裏復活的，拿撒勸耶蘇基督的名」。又說：「除他以外，並無拯救，因爲在天下人間，没有賜下别的名，我們可以靠着得救」。</p>
<p>在天上人間没有一個名字比耶蘇的名字更偉大；他是神，也是人，勝過自然，勝過死亡，如：以五餅二魚吃飽五千人，平風斥浪，從死裏復活。有一次一個回回教徒對一位基督徒說：「我們的回回教比基督教高明得多」。基督徒問他：「爲什麼？」他說：「我們到麥加城龍找到我們教主的死骨來做紀念；你們基督徒到耶路撒冷去，卻找不到你們教主耶蘇的死骨來做紀念」，那位基督徒回答說：「是的，你們能找到你們教主的骨頭，因爲他是死了，我們找不着我們教主的骨頭，因爲他是活的，三日從墳墓裏復活升天，在神的右邊爲信徒禱告」。世界各宗教的領袖，都有缺點，但耶蘇没有缺點，没有罪恶，李博士（R．Ｅ．Lea）說耶蘇是美術家，科學家，植物學家，地質學家，歷史學家，光學家，工人，農人，總而言之，他是一個完全的救主，你相信這樣完全的救主嗎？</p>
<p>一個人犯了罪，没有其它的藥能醫治，祇有耶蘇基督才能拯救，除他以外，别無拯救，因爲在天上人間，没有賜下别人的名，我們可以靠着得救。</p>

<p>— 乃流</p>
<p>路過小菜場，一堆人攔住了我的去路。嘩啦嘩啦的，不知是什麼事情發生了。</p>
<p>那一堆人的核心是一個婦人，她左手提着一隻買小菜的藍子，在人　中呆立着。旁邊有一個年老的勸她：「買小菜去了吧，他是不會來還你的了！」</p>
<p>我聽了莫明其妙。後來人漸漸的散了，那個剛剛在勸慰着婦人的老年人，似乎受到了太多的感觸，於是向這個說一陣向那個說一陣。當他走近我的時候，我就不耐煩地問她了：</p>
<p>「什麼事呀？這個婦人。」</p>
<p>「搶戒子。」年老的簡單地回答了我一聲以後，接着加了一番仔細的說明：「那個婦人帶了一隻金的指戒來買小菜，但是時間還早，菜販來的還不多，這時候卻來了兩個搶的，把她手上的指戒勒了去。並且還把她教訓一頓，說：現在人家都空着肚皮没有飯吃，你卻還要帶金戒子？說完就拿着指戒去了。」</p>
<p>我注意地聽着，心想：「現在人家都空着肚皮没有飯吃，你卻還要帶金戒子。」這大約是搶的「理由」了！那個被搶的婦人，聽了這個「理由」，不知在要用什麼話來回答呢？我想或許是回答不出什麼的。</p>
<p>（編者按：搶是犯法的，這「理由」自然不能成立。但許多人空着肚皮是事實，而有人藏着金條也是事實。）</p>

<p>— 國强</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>請你原諒我的冒昧，要求你将我下面一段遇骗的实情，公佈于贵刊一角之地，使滬地同我一樣俱好奇心者不致同遭覆轍。</p>
<p>××日的晚上，向××路路过的我，偶見周围立着许多长幼男女不齊中間的一位營業魔術先生，牆上懸着一幅引人的魔術繪圖，我就請教這位先生，授「五鬼搬運法」，付值二角，他就與我走入僻靜的地方說：「五鬼搬運」不是手法，亦不是咒法，是一種符法，因此不能當時面授，須一方將你的年齡及生日紀錄，經過他一夜的手續，隔時××時仍在×地即可授教，且當晚不能與任何朋友談及此事。第二天我就照舊約×時×路跑去這位先生早在待候了，即開始他一番騙人迷人的手段（焚符念咒），後說：這張五鬼神符，　因非真神，務須金銀銅鐵錫五物一同裏了，才可拿回家中藏在箱內，經一時後取出便可行法了；然我一時無金子及銀子，與他商量，結果說五元法幣亦可，我就將袋內五元拿出，與符一同放入自來火柴盒內，外間用皮紙一裏，用紅羅繋好交我，這時我的目力全注意在五元法幣上，但他將火柴盒藏在我的後背腰部，即褲腰布上，口中念着一請××，二請××，三請××，×××勅向西方各念一邊，同時他即將我腰部的一包火柴盒，掉爲他預先備好同樣的一盒給我（假意是爲我安放好），這時我鼓着勇氣，把他袋內的一盒奪回，忽忽走了。據說幹這行的人多得很呢，請大家留意。</p>
<p>國强先生：如果你稍稍留意報章的話，你早應知道這是個騙局了。你說「幹這行的人多得很」，就因爲像你這樣容易受騙的人多得很的緣故。但是請你息恕，我不是責怪你「受騙」，而是你受騙的因系——好奇心會有着不光明的成分。我先問你：你爲什麼不學「飛鳥人籠」，或者「紙牌飛舞」，而要學「五鬼搬運法」呢？請你忠實地回答我，你是不是想憑借了這「法術」，冀獲得意外的什麼嗎？如果是的，那末我勸告你，這樣高明的「法術」秘而不宣都唯恐不及，那裏會僅僅化二毛錢的代價就公諸同好呢？除了不義之財之外，每一分錢的收獲都要付出相當的工作的，正如你没有騙去的五元法幣決不是輕易得來的一樣。</p>
<h3 id="c95">郵票的價值 <a href="#c95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— 新方</p>
<p>在中央銀行未發行分幣券前，市上因爲缺乏銅幣，一度曾由郵票代替的時候。你說破碎的郵票不要，我說浸爛的郵票不要，郵票的價值是減低了，一元法幣竟能換一百十分至一百二十分呢！</p>
<p>到了現在，郵票又被一部分商店列爲可以謀利的東西了。昨天筆者因爲要寄一封信，就到附近的一家煙紙店去買二分郵票，該店的夥計要我三分錢，到另一家去也是同樣。時隔未久，而前後的情形，竟有如此的　異，我不禁嘆了一口氣！</p>
<h3 id="c96">藥渣 <a href="#c96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— 編著：曹健</p>
<p>在弄堂裏，我常常會發現一堆一堆國藥的渣滓。我起初很覺得奇怪，爲什麼人要把藥的渣滓倒在路的正中呢？難道没有垃圾箱嗎？假如垃圾箱是安放在很遠的地方，因爲懶惰的緣故，順手的倒在地上，那還算一點理由。說來奇怪，倒藥的渣滓的地方，離開垃圾箱只有幾步路程，那爲什麼藥的渣滓一定要倒在路中而不倒在垃圾箱裏呢？這個問題在我腦中成了一個不可解的謎。</p>
<p>有一次，當我在弄堂路中走的時候，剛巧看見了一個人把藥的渣滓倒在地上，我就對他說：「請你以後把藥的渣滓倒在垃圾箱中，不要弄得路上污穢得很。」但結果卻遭遇到他的白眼，反罵我幾句，叫我少管閑事。</p>
<p>後來偶然和一位朋友談起這件事業。他對我說：「這是中國人的迷信，以爲藥渣倒在路中，行人假如踐踏了，就會得着他家中病人的病，而他家中的病人就會好了。」我聽了朋友的話，不禁爲之一笑。在每日中，踐踏藥渣的人，不可以數計，病人真會這樣就好了嗎？踐踏藥的渣滓的人真的會生病嗎？</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>金蕙漱這顆著名的童星，最近爲二十世紀福斯公司主演的「校花小史」High　School一片，著有超越的成績。光陰很快，今年她已是十三歲了，童星時代也瞬將逝去，這裏把她成功的經過和十三歲誕辰的盛况，寫些在下面：</p>
<p>誕辰紀念</p>
<p>很小就上銀幕，到而今是十三歲了，這小姑娘無論在銀幕上或銀幕下，都很惹人歡喜。最近，當她在家一裏舉行十三歲誕辰紀念時，電影圈裏，一般人士都去祝賀，盛况空前。特別可提出的一點，就是那天她邀請了五個常影圈外的小朋友，到她家裏參加盛會，而就爲了這一邀請，二十世紀福斯拍攝「校花小史」時，這五個小朋友也都上銀幕，飾金蕙漱的同學。</p>
<p>標準影迷</p>
<p>為了她所主演的影片，每一部都有相當成功，所以銀幕下的觀衆，對於她表示愛戴。平常有很多影迷也不斷的寫信給她。金蕙漱自己不光是一顆小明星，而且也是一個標準的影迷。好萊塢的電影院，有新片放映，她十九會抽出閒來去看一次的，祇要不在拍戲，大部分空閒就耗費在電影院裏。</p>
<p>受到好攝影</p>
<p>年紀雖然還祗十三歲，可是她還會攝影。　　八耗尺寸的快鏡，時常拿在手裏，要是公司方面到外面去拍攝外景，她就會拿了照相機，隨處拍些風景片，回來的時候，總可拍到很多照片，成績相當好。所以有人說金蕙漱同時還是一個女攝影家呢！</p>
<p>飼養動物</p>
<p>金蕙漱的家裏，養着好多動物，自猴子到雞子，什麽都養着。平日非常愛護，連食物都自己去餵。玩具，機器的，泥製的，什麼都有，洋囡囡不知堆着多少。她歡喜看歷史書，關於鋸子，鐵錘，刀，和各式樣的釘，金蕙漱都有着，她自己正會做矮凳，積木，小房子一類的玩具哩。</p>

<p>— 章玉卿</p>
<p>這是夏衍在三年前爲「業餘」寫就的一部社會劇，是表現上海的超特創作。舞臺上給予我們底視覺是幢一樓一底的住宅房子，亦就是在上海習見的所謂「弄堂」房子。住在這幢屋子里的人們，當然是上海社會層里的幹部人員，正因爲社會組織的不健全，所以也住有過着私娼生活的獨身少女，熬着畢業就是失業的大學生，以及鑽在抬不起頭的三層擱樓上的報販。全劇的故事就在這樣的一個環境中展開着。</p>
<p>就全劇的成績講，可以說着實够得上水準的，但就我個人的觀後所感說來，我覺得與共忠實劇作者，不如山導演人稍加補充來得好，好比住在亭子間里的大學生黄家楣，假如把他的個性變得積極一點，那一定能够反暴露變爲指示的，尤其是當前樓的施小寳（私娼）請他看信時，他不敢抗拒她的調戲，同時從這塲合中似乎說明了，她的爲娼好像是甘習下流，並不是爲了生活。</p>
<p>又如灶披間里小學敎員趙振宇，這種隨遇而安的態度也是要不得的。他的這種適應環境的表現，恰是給予一般缺少熱血的人們的一個莫大掩護。不容說，如果他能對報販李陵碑解釋他的兒子的戰死沙塲的責任，我相信，他一定能够明瞭，眼前的戰爭是爲了甚麽。</p>
<p>在整個的演出上，觀衆們却覺得很滿意。尤其値得稱道，是裝置，對啦，在中國的舞臺上以前從來沒有見過整幢的房子出現過哩。</p>
<p>演員要算飾小學敎員的蘇丹最稱職。劉黛云也不錯。婉兒因爲沒有她做戲的機會，所以也看不出她的演技。柏李的嗓子可惜太低。餘則平平。嚴俊的流氓太欠强，這也許少體騐吧。値得不可忽視的那位飾葆珍的施玲芳小妹妹，確實是成功的，順此祝福這位新藝人努力吧。</p>

<p>London: News was received here last night from Tokyo confirming that Britain and Japan have reached an agreement to temporarily close the Burma Road to prevent supplies from being transported into China. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: During a meeting of the House of Commons today, someone asked Prime Minister Churchill if he could comment on Japan's recent request to halt the transportation of supplies through Hong Kong and Burma to China. Churchill replied that on June 24th, the Japanese government requested that the British government take measures to stop military supplies and certain other goods from being transported to China via Burma. A similar request was made regarding Hong Kong. It was claimed that the continued transportation of these materials would have a serious impact on Anglo-Japanese relations. Currently, the British government has reached the following compromise agreement with the Japanese government: "Hong Kong": Since January 1939, the export of arms and ammunition from Hong Kong has been prohibited. In fact, there is currently no export of military materials valued by the Japanese government. "Burma": The Burmese government has agreed to suspend the transportation of arms, ammunition, automobiles, trucks, and railway materials to China for a period of three months. The same types of goods prohibited in Burma will also be prohibited in Hong Kong. When considering the Japanese government's request and negotiating the above agreement, the British government has not neglected the various obligations it has accepted, including those to the Chinese government and the relevant British territories. However, the British government must also consider the current world situation (cheers). Furthermore, the evident fact that we ourselves are currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle cannot be ignored. Britain's general policy regarding the Far Eastern dispute has been repeatedly clarified. We have firmly stated our desire to see China guaranteed a future of freedom and independence (cheers). We have also repeatedly expressed our willingness to improve relations with Japan. To achieve this goal, two things are particularly important: namely, time and the easing of tensions. On the one hand, the tense situation has rapidly escalated due to Japan's complaint that military supplies are being transported to China via the Burma Road. On the other hand, if we agree to permanently close the road, it would be tantamount to abandoning our obligations to a neutral country and friend, China. Therefore, what we have now negotiated is a temporary measure, hoping that within the time gained, a solution can be found that is fair and impartial to both China and Japan and freely acceptable to both parties. We do not wish to have a conflict with any country in the Far East. We wish to see China's position and integrity maintained. In our dispatch of January 14, 1939, we expressed our readiness to negotiate with the Chinese government after the restoration of peace to abolish consular jurisdiction, return concessions, and revise treaties on a basis of mutual benefit and equality. We also wish to see Japan achieve prosperity so that its people can obtain the happiness and economic stability that every Japanese person naturally desires. To enable both countries to achieve their goals, we are prepared to offer cooperation and contribution. However, one thing must be made clear: that if both countries wish to achieve these goals, they must do so through peaceful and conciliatory means, rather than war or the threat of war.

<p>London: The Soviet ambassador to London, Maisky, visited the Foreign Office yesterday to meet with Deputy Foreign Minister Butler regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. The British side has been constantly informing other relevant governments of this negotiation event. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: The London Morning Post has published only two comments on the Burma Road issue to date. The Daily Mail said, "We must recognize reality. We are currently engaged in a life-and-death struggle alone with Germany and Italy and cannot afford to make Japan hostile to our country. Britain is willing to be friendly with Japan but does not want to obtain it through gradual concessions." Regarding the agreement as a whole, we can hope to firmly acknowledge Britain's rights in the Far East. The News Chronicle said, "From an opportunistic point of view, it would be possible to force a decision to close the Burma Road. We are now fully engaged in a great war and do not want to see a serious dispute arise in the Far East at this time, increasing the difficulty of coping. Since the United States does not wish to take effective action to extend its own objectives in the Far East, Britain can use this as another reason for its concessions to Japan. However, such a display of opportunism will not benefit our principles. The weakness we have already shown will encourage the new Japanese government to make even greater demands than it does today. It is of utmost importance that we maintain our morals today and prevent them from being tarnished." (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A certain authoritative source received news last night stating that the Anglo-Japanese agreement to close the Burma Road for three months, until October 18th, was signed yesterday in Tokyo. It was stated that during the period of closure, Japan will seek a peaceful resolution with China. British sources reiterated that if Tokyo and Chongqing need it, Britain is willing to facilitate peace in East Asia. Chinese sources asked last night what Britain would do if the United States were to cut off its supply of arms to Britain in order to facilitate peace between Britain and Germany. British commentators said that this analogy is not valid because the United States is not in a war of survival in the West. British officials here solemnly declared that Britain has not authorized Japanese consular officials to inspect or prevent traffic from the Burma Road into the Chinese mainland. However, British authorities will allow the Japanese side to review the customs statistics after they have been accurately counted. In this regard, it is believed that the British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, quickly completed the Burma agreement before the old cabinet resigned for fear that the new Japanese government might not be as friendly as the Yonai cabinet. They believe that this was the Yonai government's attempt to resolve this matter quickly before the new people took office. (18th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>American Newspapers Express Regret to Britain: A Grave Mistake Made Eight Years Ago</p>
<p>New York: The New York Herald Tribune recently published a commentary on the Anglo-Japanese agreement on the Burma Road, stating that the British concession is reportedly limited to three months, but no one who understands the situation in the East believes that Japan will allow the status quo to be restored when the deadline arrives. On the contrary, Japan will definitely demand more, knowing that British concessions are almost certain. The United States has no effective way to deal with this except to regret that Britain did not adopt a policy of appeasement eight years ago during the Manchurian Incident; otherwise, Japan would not have dared to insult the British Empire in this way today.

<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull yesterday reiterated the government's position on Britain's closure of the Yunnan-Burma Road and rejected reports that Germany had proposed that the United States protest Britain's blockade of Germany in order to be consistent with each other.

<h3 id="e4">These Three Months <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>The Anglo-Japanese Burma transport agreement has been confirmed in both Tokyo and London. The agreement stipulates that the British government must prohibit weapons, bullets, gasoline, trucks, and railway materials from being transported to China via Burma for a period of three months, starting yesterday, July 18th, indicating that the agreement was concluded before yesterday.</p>
<p>British foreign affairs authorities made no explanations or strong defenses in their parliament regarding this issue, silently accepting the jeers of "Shameful!" and "Truly shameful!" from members of parliament. The general public in Britain has expressed outrage at this agreement to varying degrees; while some British sources have said that even if the Yunnan-Burma Road is blocked for three months, it will not have much impact on military supplies because the road is often plagued by torrential tropical rains in July, August, and September, making it impossible for trucks to travel. Furthermore, the National Government has planned ahead and stored ample military supplies, so it will not hinder the war of resistance, and so on. The facts on which these explanations are based are certainly credible; after all, July, August, and September are the rainy season in the Southwest, and the military supplies needed for the war of resistance in three or five months will certainly not rely on these three months of Yunnan-Burma Road transport. However, facts are facts and absolutely cannot be used to excuse Britain's abandonment of treaty morality. Therefore, the National Government's strong protest, with its stern wording and righteous arguments, has irrefutable basis, but it is not protesting because the military supplies for the war of resistance have been severely affected. In short, the direct interests involved are not significant, but the principles at stake must of course be fought for.</p>
<p>In terms of principles, the three-month suspension cannot be ignored. Furthermore, from another perspective, these three months are indeed an extremely important period internationally, and Britain's signing of this agreement only exposes cowardice and stupidity. Why is this an extremely important period internationally? First, Germany and Italy will immediately launch something against Britain. Assuming that what is launched is an important proposal with peace terms, then it should not be presumed beforehand that Britain will weigh the pros and cons and absolutely reject it; assuming that what is launched is a general offensive by the army, air force, and navy, then it should not be presumed beforehand that Britain will strongly resist it and absolutely not retreat. The current Germany, since successively conquering Poland, Norway, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, and with Italy joining the war and Romania changing its allegiance, is no longer the Germany confined to Central Europe. It is no longer worried about being blockaded and running out of resources and is gradually preparing for the conditions for a long war, but its war plan is still to achieve a quick victory; and it is rumored that the Führer Hitler has boasted that he will triumph over Britain by the end of July. The current Britain, although fighting alone, has repeatedly expressed its determination to fight a long-term war from the government to the people, and Prime Minister Churchill and his cabinet are full of vigor; but at least taking the Yunnan-Burma transport issue as an example, it can be proved that Britain is very likely to be like a divine dragon, with only its head visible and not its tail. Moreover, modern three-dimensional tactics are certainly not comparable to the two-dimensional positional warfare of previous years. Whether it is offense or defense, it is easy to distinguish victory and defeat. Therefore, we deeply feel that although the Anglo-German war has a magnificent momentum, it is not an accident that it can end within these three months.</p>
<p>Second, after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan has overthrown its cabinet four times, and now Konoe is back again. This fact illustrates the instability of the domestic political situation in Japan, which we will not discuss for the time being; but Konoe's re-appointment as prime minister, in his subjective desire to resolve what the Japanese call the China Incident, is what he unabashedly proclaims. Originally, in terms of Japan's objective conditions, it is impossible not to seek to stop the invasion and resolve the war. If it is not resolved, how will Japan support it? How will Konoe maintain it? How will he step down? Therefore, this time, putting forward Konoe, and even the so-called "New Structure," is actually Japan's last resort. Because of this, after Konoe comes to power, he will exert all his remaining strength, at home, to China, and to other countries, economically, diplomatically, and militarily, to make a new plan that opens up a new perspective. There is no need to speculate too much on the direction and content of the plan today. Taking Anglo-Japanese relations as an example, no matter whether the Burma suspension agreement stipulates only Britain's unilateral obligation to yield, even if there is, as some people in Britain "hear," that there are other exchanges, that there is other tacit understanding, but Konoe says to Britain that he will be bound by this agreement and that he will use this agreement as the basis for improving Anglo-Japanese relations, then no one in the world except the British would think so. Therefore, it is speculated that in these three months, after Japan launches its last resort, the international community must prepare for the coming of changes.</p>
<p>Third, the international situation is turbulent and changing in an instant, and there are three more noteworthy points today: the US presidential election in November, whether Roosevelt will break the precedent and run for a third term, is a major issue related to the United States and the world; last night's Chicago telegram reported that the Democratic Party has included Roosevelt in the list of candidates. The Soviet Union seems to have tacitly agreed with Germany and Italy and remained still in the Balkans after Romania yielded; but last night's news reported that Soviet troops have again occupied twelve villages in Romania; to know what happens next, we must wait and see. Spain has been enduring for a long time, and the Strait of Gibraltar, the throat of the Mediterranean, has long been controlled by the British, which is something that the Spanish have never forgotten; yesterday, the Spanish head of state Franco publicly demanded its return. These three things will all ferment within three months.</p>
<p>China's war of resistance is currently under deadlock and in stability. Although a major counteroffensive may not be imminent, it is not far off; but Britain's these three months will inevitably encounter unprecedented severe tests. Who will be the person to discuss and decide on the Burma transport issue after three months? It may also be left as a question for the time being; it is also a very reasonable phenomenon and development that China participates in the discussion at that time!</p>
<p>Hull stated here to the press that blockades between belligerent countries are recognized by international law, while those via private routes in non-belligerent territories are governed by other provisions. Once a belligerent country declares its belligerent rights, it enjoys the right of blockade at sea and may legally intercept goods and interfere with any non-neutral actions. As for private routes, they are governed by completely different regulations. The recent new restrictions on Sino-British traffic through Hong Kong and the Burma Road have been highlighted by a report from the Department of Commerce. The report stated that in May, Hong Kong exported 2 million pounds of tung oil, of which 1.69 million pounds were shipped to the United States and only 249,000 pounds were shipped to Europe. Department of Commerce officials said that as for the Yunnan-Burma Road, statistics are unavailable. (18th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Sir Cecil Hopes Government Will Consider Matters Carefully in the House of Lords</p>
<p>London: Sir Cecil said in the House of Lords yesterday that he did not want to embarrass the government at this time, but there was something he had to say, namely that negotiations with Japan had caused anxiety to a large portion of the public. Rumors that some people were using British influence to seek peace between China and Japan were noteworthy, so he asked the government to proceed with caution. As for the closure of the Burma Road, he hoped that the government would handle the matter with extreme care to avoid taking actions that would help Japan and suppress China. Sir Cecil claimed, "We allow the Burma Road to be used by private individuals or other parties to transport goods that will be sold to China or have already been sold to China. This is not a violation of neutrality. The normal use of trade routes is what we should enjoy. We all recognize that the situation is very serious, and I am very willing not to hinder the government from taking any steps it deems necessary to reduce the severity of the overall situation. However, I ask the government to consider whether making concessions to Japan under obvious threats can alleviate this severity. What we need to consider is not only the magnitude and immediate consequences of our actions, but also the ultimate consequences on which the final victory of the war depends." Foreign Secretary Halifax replied that he could not debate with Cecil at this time, but he was very sorry if Cecil or other lords thought that the government had not paid attention to this serious matter. He hoped to make a more detailed statement to the House of Lords tomorrow, and the House of Lords could wait patiently. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London: Labour MP Hugh Dalton asked Deputy Foreign Minister Butler in the House of Commons yesterday to explain in unambiguous terms that Britain was eager to avoid conflict with Japan but did not want to flatter Japan. Butler replied that he hoped that the detailed comments to be made public would explain the government's policy on this matter and satisfy the House of Commons, so he did not want to make any statements at this time. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Famous British Commentator Advocates Convening a Conference of the Five Great Powers</p>
<p>London: The News Chronicle today published a suggestion from Bartley, a famous commentator on international affairs, advocating convening a conference of the five great powers to discuss the Far East issue. It is said that Secretary of State Hull's declaration is sufficient to indicate a way to deal with the issue more bravely and solemnly. Given his position, Hull knows how difficult it would be for Britain to defend the Burma Road by force without assistance. A conference of the relevant powers—Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, China, and Japan—is diplomatically possible. The Japanese also know Britain's difficulties, and there are various reasons to believe that the new Japanese government will be even more insistent on its demands than the previous government. However, they also know that Japan's current position cannot be enlarged by expanding the war. They cannot defeat China without supplies from the Western powers. They know that the Chinese are now very determined and will not allow any part of China to belong to Japan. Therefore, it may be possible to find a solution that allows the Japanese army to retreat from China while slightly conceding face and is approved by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek if they are willing to see an independent China discuss with the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. (18th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Still Says Agreement Is Not Extremely Satisfactory</p>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today in response to questions about the Anglo-Japanese Burma Road agreement that it was not extremely satisfactory. For the next three months, the Burma Road is in the rainy season, and transportation may not be very high, but the spokesman hoped that when transportation gradually becomes more frequent after the rainy season, the suspension of war materials on the road will be more strict. When asked about Britain's protest against Japan's suspension of shipping off the coast of Central and Southern China, the spokesman replied that he had seen this news in a certain newspaper and said that Japan's new actions were based on absolute military necessity. Shipping merchants of all countries must recognize that large-scale military operations are currently underway in China. This fact has been recognized by both Britain and France, so it is advisable for ships from third countries not to try to approach the designated areas in Central and Southern China. As for the safe harbors in the designated areas, the spokesman said that the climate can be predicted, and once the direction of the approaching hurricane is known, each ship can make the necessary preparations in advance.

<p>Chinese Transport Vehicles Begin to Move to Northwest Highway for Use</p>
<p>Chongqing: Due to the blockade of Southwest transport, the government has begun to transfer a large number of vehicles to Northwest transport for use to increase the transportation of goods. Subsequently, Chinese inland goods will reach the Soviet Union via the Xinjiang Highway. As of now, there are 1,000 vehicles traveling between China and the Soviet Union via the Xinjiang Highway.

<p>Sino-American Cultural Association Cables Hull to Appeal</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Sino-American Cultural Association telegraphed Secretary of State Hull, saying, briefly, that the Chinese people deeply appreciate your steadfast position on the Yunnan-Burma transport issue. The diplomatic policy adopted by Britain in the spirit of the Munich Agreement will further destroy the peace and order in the Far East that has been painstakingly maintained by past and present statesmen in the United States. In order to uphold justice, please take active actions, such as completely stopping arms exports to Japan, so as to impose effective sanctions on the aggressor. Sincerely, Chu Ching-wei, Director-General of the Sino-American Cultural Association. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: News of Britain's concession to Japan, agreeing to Japan's request to suspend transport to China via Burma, has caused deep indignation among people throughout China. Chu Chia-hua, President of the Chinese League of Nations Union, has telegraphed Sir Cecil, President of the League of Nations Union, asking him to advise the British government to rein in before it is too late. (18th dispatch)</p>
<p>Diplomatic Association Hopes Britain Will Cancel the Suspension Decision</p>
<p>Chongqing: The National Diplomatic Association believes that Britain's compromise with Japan today, blocking the Yunnan-Burma Road, is an unprecedentedly dishonorable event in British diplomatic history. Japan is invading China without daring to formally declare war and has no right to block traffic between third countries and China. Even if war has already been declared, it cannot interfere with the territory of third countries. Moreover, Britain has repeatedly stated that it will abide by the resolutions of the League of Nations and will not take any steps to weaken China's strength in the war of resistance. Today, it has violated its promises and illegally blocked the Zhen-Burma transport, which is not only unacceptable in law and morality, but also causes infinite damage to Britain's interests and security. Japan is getting an inch and will take a mile and will attack British territories in the Pacific. China's war of resistance is a matter of life and death for the entire nation and will not be stopped by Japan's threats or the obstruction of any third country. Japan's belief that blocking transport can "end the incident" is a foolish illusion. Moreover, China has long had sufficient preparations for military supplies, and its determination and policies for the war of resistance will not change in the slightest as a result. The association specifically wrote to the China Aid Committee in London with the above meaning, forwarding it to the British Parliament and the British people, hoping to advise the British government to quickly cancel the decision to suspend Burmese transport.

<p>Tokyo: Japan's new Prime Minister Konoe declared to Japanese journalists last night that the Japanese Prime Minister should cooperate closely with the Japanese military.

<h3 id="e17">US Democratic Party Convention Nominates Roosevelt as Presidential Candidate; Unanimous and Enthusiastic Support; Result Achieved in First Ballot <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Chicago: President Roosevelt, amidst cheers, has been nominated as the presidential candidate by the Democratic Party convention this morning. In the first ballot, President Roosevelt's votes overwhelmed Vice President Garner, Senator Tydings, Secretary of State Hull, and the anti-Roosevelt opposition faction supporting Farley. According to unofficial reports, in the first ballot, President Roosevelt received 946.5 votes, Farley 72.5 votes, Garner 61 votes, Tydings 9.5 votes, Hull 6 votes, in addition to 3 spoiled ballots and 1.5 abstentions. However, news regarding whether President Roosevelt is willing to serve a third consecutive term is still unknown. The election was held at the same venue where President Roosevelt first became a candidate in July 1932, the sweltering arena. Although cheers were constantly heard before President Roosevelt's election, the convention proceeded according to its usual procedures. The names of three other individuals were also presented to the convention, namely Postmaster General Farley, Vice President Garner, and Maryland Democratic Senator Tydings, with Tydings being a prominent leader opposing Roosevelt, who strongly opposed President Roosevelt's third term. Roosevelt's election came after the delegates passed a resolution from the Resolutions Committee at 9 p.m., strongly supporting the New Deal and opposing war. After the isolationists prevailed in the debate, the convention decided to adopt a platform guaranteeing that the American military would only defend the Western Hemisphere and not be involved in wars elsewhere, the procedure for electing President Roosevelt then commenced. Simultaneously, Montana Senator Wheeler withdrew from the presidential race, claiming that President Roosevelt's staff had been engaged in campaigning and enabling President Roosevelt to be re-elected. The election of the vice-presidential candidate will be held tomorrow, after which the convention will adjourn. (18th dispatch, United Press)</p>
<p>Chicago: The Democratic Party convention has just elected Roosevelt as the Democratic presidential candidate in the first ballot with an absolute majority. After the vote count was completed, Postmaster General Farley proposed that Roosevelt be elected in a form of full support, and the audience welcomed the proposal with applause. Subsequently, spokespersons from each state seconded and supported Roosevelt's election one by one. Whenever a state announced its secondment, the attending delegates and people in the audience cheered. Before the vote, Senator Hill said that the whole country looked forward to Roosevelt, not just one state or one place, otherwise, the state of Alabama he represented would have nominated Bankhead. Congressman Ryan proposed an amendment that the president should not be re-elected for a third term, which was denounced by the delegates and was rejected. Senator Glass spoke, nominating Farley as the presidential candidate, and his speech also defended the traditional custom of the president not serving three consecutive terms, which shows that a small number of people are indeed opposed to Roosevelt's third election. The new Democratic Party platform was quickly adopted by the delegates, and the delegates lined up and paraded with flags in hand to show their welcome to the platform, accompanied by bands and piano, which increased the liveliness of the venue. Farley's proposal to elect Roosevelt unanimously in the whole house was met with the most enthusiastic support from the convention. The state of Texas was the first to change the votes originally for Garner to vote for Roosevelt, and Senator Tydings also voluntarily withdrew his right to be elected and supported Farley's proposal. Secretary of State Hull, although his name was not nominated, also asked to change the few votes he received to elect Roosevelt. (18th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>Content of the Platform Passed by the Convention</p>
<p>Chicago: The 4,000-word Democratic Party platform, which was passed by the convention, stated that the American people are determined not to allow the wars currently taking place in Europe, Asia, and Africa to spread to the Americas, nor to participate in foreign wars. Except when attacked, they will not send their land, sea, and air forces to fight abroad. The United States must be strong enough that other countries, even if united, dare not attack the United States. The experience of other countries warns the United States that a comprehensive defense is the only way to resist insults, and a partial defense is equal to no defense. The United States will do its best to destroy the insidious activities of disguised anti-democratic and un-American organizations. In order to ensure that American armaments should be instruments of peace, the United States will continue its traditional good-neighbor policy, abide by and advocate international respect for the rights of other countries and treaty obligations, and promote commercial and economic cooperation with these Western Hemisphere republics. The United States, as the world's largest democracy, cannot remain indifferent or, in a spirit of appeasement, despise peace-loving people who are being recklessly attacked by aggressive countries, for the sake of self-defense and for the sake of conscience. The United States will assume the task of providing these people with all material assistance suitable for the law without hindering self-defense, so that peace and international faith can eventually prevail. The rest of the platform focuses on domestic affairs, recognizing the current rural programs, committing to continuing to enforce appropriate wage standards, and advocating convening a national unemployment conference. It also stated that the Democratic Party will continue to attack the unlimited concentration of economic power. The Republican Party's nomination of Willkie, a leading figure in public utilities, as its presidential candidate has raised the question of whether the nation's water resources should be used for the benefit of all people or for the profit of a few. (18th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>Chicago: Several members of the Democratic Party's drafting committee for the foreign policy platform reopened discussions yesterday after speaking with President Roosevelt by telephone. Before long, drafters of the platform claimed that after a day of debate, they had finally agreed on a moderate foreign policy platform. It is heard that the currently drafted platform guarantees not to send American armed forces across the ocean to fight, and reaffirms the American determination to safeguard the Monroe Doctrine, in other words, the Western Hemisphere shows sympathy for the democratic countries resisting totalitarian countries, and supports giving various assistance to these countries that do not violate the law. House Speaker Bankhead later said that the entire 1940 platform has been unanimously agreed upon, and although there were debates on foreign policy, there were no major changes to the original plan.

<p>Tallinn: Soviet Deputy Foreign People's Commissar Dekanozov, along with Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee Veteski, arrived here yesterday. It is expected that Mr. Dekanozov will hold consultations with Mr. Stahanov, a member of the Supreme Soviet currently here.

These sources said that the withdrawal of garrison troops and military supplies from the island began in July, and has now been fully completed. The Åland Islands are at the entrance of the Gulf of Bothnia and are strategically important because they can protect the east coast of Sweden and the west coast of Finland.

There are now various reasons to believe that hundreds of experienced American pilots are eager to enlist. Although there is no question of forming a purely American squadron at present, there is a possibility of gradually forming an American squadron in the future. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

<p>British Air Minister warns the people</p>
<p>London - Air Minister Sinclair, in a broadcast to the Empire last night, said that a large-scale German attack on Britain from the sea, land, and air is bound to fail. The enemy air force, due to its numerical superiority, remains a serious threat. We must be prepared to face air attacks on a scale several times greater than before. However, so far, the enemy has only been able to inflict insignificant damage on us. We are not content with repelling attacking enemy aircraft, and we are also launching major attacks on Germany. The enemy now occupies a vast coastline and can invade Britain not only from bases in Germany, but also from Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, or France. Therefore, in addition to ceaseless maritime patrols, Britain must also pay attention to the above-mentioned locations, Sinclair continued, highly praising Canadian, Australian, and New Zealand pilots, saying that the self-governing dominions have valuable training space and can build an air force that is numerically stronger than Germany's. The sooner Britain takes the offensive, the sooner it will win. Since the beginning of this month, a total of 105 German planes have been shot down, while 24 British planes have been lost in combat with German planes. Moreover, the British Air Force flies into enemy territory to fight without ceasing, causing considerable damage to German war industries and transportation. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Germany announces the results of naval and air battles</p>
<p>Berlin - Today's German military report stated that German warships recently operating overseas sank another 30,000 tons of enemy cargo. German fighter planes attacked the army training camp set up by the British in Aldershot, and bombed the aircraft fields, port works, industrial buildings, revolving bridges, aircraft fields, and factories in southern and central England, and in Eastbourne. The fires caused by the hits illuminated the distance. The large arsenal in Greenock was also hit by bombs. German planes also attacked ships in the English Channel. One ship was hit and caught fire, and another was heavily damaged. Nine other patrol boats were also heavily damaged. All crew members abandoned ship and fled. Last night, enemy planes flew over the Rhine region and the Ruhr region, but were repelled by enemy anti-aircraft guns. They failed to aim and drop bombs. Germany suffered no losses. One British plane was shot down north of Cherbourg, and one German plane crashed into the English Channel. (Haitong, 18th)</p>

<p>German newspaper comments on Churchill's speech</p>
<p>Berlin - According to the "Hamburger Ausland Zeitung," there is only one possible response to Churchill's speech, and that is a German attack. Churchill declared that he would defend London even if it were turned into a rubble field. This statement has proven that London is not an undefended city, but a military fortress. In this situation, it would not be surprising if Churchill's prediction came true. Churchill is prepared to subject London to the same fate as Warsaw and Rotterdam, and knows that this destructive action cannot prevent Germany and Italy from rebuilding Europe. (Haitong, 18th)</p>

<p>New York - The New York Times stated in an editorial today that the Italian navy and air force have not yet blockaded the central Mediterranean Sea, preventing British warships from venturing in. The naval battle last week occurred in the central Mediterranean, in what Italy calls its territorial waters. According to Italian statements, British ships disregarded Italian air attacks, crossed the area safely, and escorted ships directly to their destination. From this, it can be seen that the British naval power has gained the upper hand in the initial engagement with the Italian air power, and the Italian claim that the Mediterranean is its territorial sea is still just empty talk.

<p>London - The House of Commons last night again questioned the plan to send British children to self-governing dominions and the United States, and strongly advocated eliminating class distinctions. Labor Party member Griffiths said that the people want to hear whether the plan is suspended or whether an announcement is made to abolish it. If it is impossible to evacuate children from all classes, then the government should prevent the children of wealthy families from leaving the country. Labor Party members are very disturbed by the fact that the children of cabinet members have already left the country. Prime Minister Churchill recently asked senior officials to set an example for the people, but those in high positions have not set the best example. Their actions are hated and give the people the impression that Britain is still ruled by the aristocracy. Conservative Party member Braithwaite asked whether the government would allow the United States to send ships to pick up the children. 4,000 people have registered with the American committee in the past two days. The committee will send them out as soon as ships are available. He hopes that under this plan, children who cannot afford the ship fare can get help. Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Shakespeare replied that he has been ordered to proceed with preparations, and the children will be sent as soon as the situation improves. The reason for the suspension is only because of the military situation. As for the matter of the United States sending ships to pick up British children, there is no formal proposal for this at present. If there is one, the government will definitely consider it. The self-governing dominions and the United States have all agreed to take in 50,000 British children each. (Reuters, 18th)</p>

France severed diplomatic relations with Britain, but Britain recalled its envoy to France on June 20 and isolated itself from France. Later, the events of Oran and other attacks completely severed British-French relations. Baudouin mentioned economic issues, briefly stating that economic life is based on cooperation.

<h3 id="e40">All Iron Gates in the French Concession Are Closed; Tram Workers' Strike Gradually Intensifies; Traffic in Southern City Temporarily Cut Off to Prevent Disputes; Tram Workers Continued Working as Usual Yesterday; Rumors of Political Instigation Behind the Scenes <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The iron gates along the Chinese boundary of the French Concession at Xinkai River, Xinqiao Street, and Nanyang Bridge, which had been open for a long time, were all closed uniformly from yesterday morning, completely severing female communication between the Southern City and the French Concession. Residents of the Southern City who wanted to enter the concession had to detour through Pudong, resulting in a threefold increase in business for all ferries. It is reported that the reason why the French authorities suddenly closed the iron gates is related to the copper workers' strike in the French Tram Company. It is understood that the French authorities have detected that most of the striking workers reside in the Southern City, and there are rumors of meetings being held to discuss expansion. The French Concession police, in order to maintain public utilities and order within the concession, had no choice but to temporarily close the gates. Details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Negotiations Break Down; Workers Simultaneously Go on Strike</p>
<p>More than 700 copper workers from the machinery department of the French Tram Company at 249 Rue Lyons have recently requested a 30% salary increase from the company due to difficult living conditions. However, according to labor sources, the labor's demand is for the company to subsidize the amount exceeding 50 yuan when the rice price exceeds 50 yuan, while the company only agreed to subsidize 4.5 yuan for the amount exceeding 50 yuan. As a result, the two sides had differing opinions and the matter was delayed. The labor side set a deadline for the company to reply by 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, but the company insisted on negotiating at 5:00 PM yesterday. Therefore, the labor side simultaneously went on strike at around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Trams and Buses Run as Usual</p>
<p>After receiving the news, the responsible police department immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to maintain order. The striking workers all left the company. The rumors that the strikers were the company's drivers and that all French trams and public buses on routes 21 and 22 had stopped running for an hour the night before were not true. According to a reporter from the Pingming News Agency, it was learned from the company yesterday that most of the workers participating in the strike reside in the Southern City, and they all went to the Southern City to gather and discuss after the strike, and there were also reports of them participating in the so-called "Workers' Welfare Association."</p>
<p>All Border Iron Gates Closed</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to prevent other workers in the company from being seduced or other accidents from occurring, the company agreed with the French Concession police authorities yesterday morning to temporarily close all the iron gates of the French Concession bordering the Southern City, such as Nanyang Bridge, Xinqiao Street, and Xinkai River, from 7:30 AM yesterday, stopping traffic. As a result, some people who wanted to pass through were trapped inside and outside the iron gates and could not pass through. According to police authorities, the closure will remain in effect until the strike is completely resolved, so it is expected that traffic between the French Concession and the Southern City will not be restored for a few days.</p>
<p>Police Take Strict Precautions</p>
<p>Since the copper workers of the French Tram Company went on strike, the French Concession authorities, fearing actions that would disrupt public order, have taken strict precautions near the tram company on Rue Lyons. An armored car was parked at the side door of the tram company on Kangti Road, guarded by four French Huajie police officers with guns. Another armored car was parked in front of the main gate, and more than 20 French Huajie police officers were on strict guard. The situation was quite tense. Since the copper workers went on strike, there have been many vehicles awaiting repair at the company, and vehicles that must be repaired before they can run every day are now also stranded.</p>
<p>The Company's Attitude</p>
<p>Company staff believe that this strike is purely a kind of political development, so they advocate that the management should maintain a firm and unyielding attitude towards the workers' demands for increased wages and rice subsidies. These staff members pointed out that the tram company's management had previously stated that it was prepared to consider any reasonable demands put forward by the workers, as long as the motives for these demands were genuine needs and made in a peaceful manner. However, when accepting most of the demands put forward by the workers three months ago, it was said that the company authorities warned the workers that anyone who was instigated by political parties to pester the management would be rebuffed. It was found that when the strike was first launched, only 200 workers joined the strike, but now it has expanded to 700 people. However, drivers, ticket sellers, and ticket inspectors have not participated, so the public bus and tram services can still proceed as usual.</p>
<p>Someone Else Is Behind the Instigation</p>
<p>According to company staff, the strike was actually instigated by someone. Company manager Feifeili neither confirmed nor denied this news, but said that the 700 workers currently on strike, who insist on their "excessive demands," will make it possible for the French Concession's buses and trams to stop completely in less than two weeks. Fei said that the wages earned by the workers of the French Tram Company are not inferior to those of workers employed by major firms in this port, and now the negotiations between the management and worker representatives have broken down.</p>
<p>Qiuxin Shipyard Also Went on Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>All the workers of the French Qiuxin Shipyard on Jichang Street in the Southern City, in order to express their support for the French water and electricity colleagues, also took consistent action from yesterday morning. At the same time, the French water and electricity company's tap water pavilion and machinery factory on Jichang Street is also located there, which draws water from the Huangpu River and connects to the Lujiawan main water distribution cabinet in the French Concession, supplying users in the entire French Concession. It is quite important, so the factory has hired French and Russian craftsmen to work in shifts to avoid interruption. A water storage pool has long been built in the underground of the French Garden, which is sufficient for many hours of need.</p>
<h3 id="e41">This Newspaper Received a Telegram from Zhenhai; Local Situation is Stable; Japanese Warships Gather in Hangzhou Bay; Chinese Army Uses Containment Strategy Along the River <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>This newspaper received the latest news at 0:35 this morning, saying that the Zhenhai County Government and the County Public Security Bureau had relocated their offices due to the emergency situation, but returned to their original locations yesterday afternoon. The local situation is extremely stable.</p>
<p>Since the Japanese side blockaded the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian at midnight on the 15th, fierce artillery battles have been taking place outside Zhenhai Port for days. Yesterday, the battle did not stop all day and intensified. The garrison of Zhenhai Fortress calmly fought back and launched a fierce counterattack under the intensive Japanese artillery fire. A medium-sized Japanese warship was hit by more than ten shells and sank within minutes. Five other ships were injured and fled in panic. The remnants of the White Chicken Mountain were completely wiped out on the 17th night after being encircled and suppressed by the Chinese. Zhejiang Chairman Huang Shaohong and Commander-in-Chief of the ×th Army Corps Liu Jianxu have both arrived at the defense line to command due to the serious situation in eastern Zhejiang, and have transferred large numbers of elite troops from 囗囗 and 囗囗 to reinforce Yongzhen. Morale is high, the military appearance is strong, and the people are at peace. They are determined to annihilate all invading Japanese troops.</p>
<p>Containment Strategy</p>
<p>After the Japanese troops on White Chicken Mountain were eliminated, the Chinese authorities immediately stationed heavy troops there and at Chuanshan and Chaiqiao to prevent Japanese troops from invading. In the Zhenhai Qiliqi Ligang area, in addition to the five injured and one sunk Japanese warships, there are more than ten other ships anchored in the waters there, and two Japanese planes flew to Zhensi to bomb indiscriminately. The bombs fell on wasteland. After a fierce shooting by the Chinese air defense troops, they fled. At the same time, Chinese guerrillas in Xiaoshan, Fuchun River, Hangzhou, and the four suburbs all dispatched separately to contain Japanese reinforcements.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Telegraph</p>
<p>From dawn to noon yesterday, because no telegrams from Yongzhen arrived, the Japanese and speculative merchants fabricated rumors again, saying that Zhenhai had been landed. However, at 1:00 PM, Ningbo merchants received a telegram saying, "Chinese troops gather, Liu (Jianxu) Huang (Shao　) personally went to the front line to command, Yongzhen is as peaceful as ever." Ningbo postal and telegraph exchanges are also still smooth. However, it was rumored again last night that telecommunications were interrupted.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Appear</p>
<p>The coastline of Hangzhou Bay is winding and stretches for hundreds of miles. At each port, such as Yuyao, Andong, 　Shanwei, Cixi, Guanhaiwei, Zhenhai, Longshan, Fenghua, and Houtoudu, Japanese planes and warships appear, shining with sea-searching lights at night, which are dazzling. The intention is unclear, but the local people are able to deal with them calmly. The number of Japanese warships has increased to 29, surrounding the waters of Zhenhai Ligang. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired from the Ningbo Shanghai group last night, Xiaogang, Zhenhai (south of the Grand Canyon), was once landed by Japanese troops on the 17th and was bravely repelled by our garrison. Furthermore, at the Hengshan Pier in Dongxiang Binhai, Yinxian, Ningbo, a battle once broke out on the afternoon of the 16th. The Japanese warships fled after the garrison opened fire. At 4:00 PM on the 16th, three Japanese planes dropped four bombs on Zhenhai Meilu. After investigation, there were no casualties of people or animals.</p>
<p>Oil Tanker Detained</p>
<p>The English-language Greater American Evening Post reported that after the Japanese began blockading the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian a few days ago, the British-owned Asia Petroleum Company's Chuguang (transliteration) ship, which was docked in Ningbo, did not sail out, resulting in its detention by the Japanese naval authorities for 16 hours. It was only released this morning (18th). It is heard that British and Japanese authorities are not taking this matter seriously, as they believe that the ship may not have received the Japanese military's notice to gather in the area. According to Jinong, nine British ships, seven Portuguese ships, and several foreign ships from other countries have all received the Japanese blockade news and sailed away from Ningbo and Zhenhai, but the Chuguang did not sail away within the time limit set by the Japanese authorities, resulting in its detention. A Japanese naval spokesperson stated this morning that the matter should be investigated to determine whether the captain of the ship was aware of the Japanese notice. It is expected that the Chuguang will return to Shanghai this afternoon and will dock at the Asia Wharf in Pudong.</p>
<p>Postal Delivery Routes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration is still dredging the delivery of light mail to the Zhejiang and Fujian areas. According to a senior postal official from the Transportation Department of the Bureau who spoke to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, since the seaports of Zhejiang and Fujian were blockaded, all navigation ships have stopped sailing one after another, so the mail received from Zhejiang and Fujian since the 16th has not been sent out. It is now planned that (1) eastern Zhejiang will be re-routed via Hangzhou, and (2) Fuzhou will be re-routed via Guangzhou. However, no formal decision has been made as of last night.</p>

<p>Since the commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in China announced the blockade of the coasts of Zhejiang and Fujian, foreign shipping companies, in order to maintain their shipping business with China, decided to find ways to send ships to resume sailing in addition to reporting to their respective consuls in Shanghai to negotiate with Japan. The German-owned Gaodeng ship is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Songmen and Wanligang today. The Shenfu, Yongfeng, and Xinanna ships are scheduled to sail to Xinghua and Quanzhou within the next few days. However, navigation to Ningbo has been temporarily suspended due to military actions in Zhenhai.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Fujian Shipping Routes</p>
<p>Foreign shipping companies are preparing to resume navigation to Xinghua and Quanzhou ports in Fujian: (1) The British-owned Yilong Company's Shenfu ship completed customs clearance at Sanjiangkou yesterday and was approved to export from Shanghai today. The Shenyou ship is now waiting at Sanjiangkou and it has been decided that several ships will sail this route in the future. It is heard that the schedule can be arranged within the next week. (2) The British-owned Yongfeng ship, managed by the Fusheng Company, plans to sail from Shanghai to Xinghua and Quanzhou within the next few days, but customs clearance was not seen yesterday. (3) The British-owned 　Ciyang Company's Xinanna ship is scheduled to load cargo in Shanghai and sail to Quanzhou today. Customs clearance was also not seen yesterday. However, there are no ships sailing to Sandu'ao and Fuzhou for the time being.</p>
<p>Japanese Ship Itinerary</p>
<p>The Lower Temple of Baoben Hall of Putuoshan and the South Department of the East China Shipping Bureau dispatched three Japanese ships, Changrong, Chenli, and Lianfeng, to sail exclusively between Shanghai and Putuoshan, departing once every two days. The ships dock at the Guangxin Wharf in Yangshupu. It is heard that the Lianfeng ship has already raised its anchor from Shanghai at 5:00 PM yesterday. The ticket price is uniformly 12 yuan. Their external publicity is to facilitate pilgrimage to Putuo Guanyin's birthday, but because the situation on the mountain has not become peaceful, there are few passengers. As for those who go to the mountain to escape the summer heat, it can be said that there are none.</p>
<p>Ligang Navigation</p>
<p>The German-owned Lulin Trading Company's Gaodeng ship published a shipping schedule advertisement yesterday: "Departing for Songmen and Wanligang at 5:00 PM on July 19." However, according to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, it was learned that the ship has decided to stop sailing to Songmen (outside the Haimen Jiaojiang Port) and will go directly from Shanghai to Ligang (a small island outside Zhenhai Port). As for the German-owned Haiyi ship, which sailed from Shanghai to Ligang the day before yesterday, it arrived safely at Ligang yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Yongzhen Suspension</p>
<p>Foreign merchant ships sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Zhen lines have temporarily suspended navigation because the Japanese side used the excuse that there were military actions in Zhenhai and are waiting for the resumption order from their respective consuls. The foreign ships docked in Shanghai include Deping, Shantong, Hana, Jiangding, Ruitai, Jiangsu, Haifu, Changde, and Avima Li. Those fearing repairs at Yongjiang include Kaisideng. The Shanghai Customs has even agreed to the Japanese request and refused customs clearance for merchant ships of various countries wishing to sail to Ningbo and Zhenhai.</p>
<p>Sailing Wenzhou Ship</p>
<p>The German-owned Lulin Trading Company's Feikang ship and the British ship Ka Siding, represented by the American-owned Weili Han Company, which sailed the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, have recently unloaded cargo in Wenzhou. Yesterday, the Fdiath Mmoller ship cleared customs and is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Wenzhou today. The ships that have been notified to temporarily suspend navigation include Chang Youli and Anna, and are also waiting for the orders of their respective consuls. As for the Baoli ship of the Italian-owned Yihua Trading Company, which sailed from Shanghai to Yueqing last Sunday, there is no telegram as to whether it has arrived at its destination. However, the shipping company plans to send ships to sail, as there are no battles in Wenzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Withdrawal of Italian Troops from Tianjin is Absolutely Untrue; Japanese Side Also Says They Are Unaware <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that it was recently rumored that the Italian Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai would withdraw to Tianjin. According to the Japanese Embassy spokesperson Hejianxian, this statement is mostly a rumor and he has not heard of it. However, if this statement is true and the troops of all belligerent countries withdraw from this city, as advocated by Nanjing and the Japanese authorities, it will be beneficial to Shanghai. It is also rumored that the Italian troops stationed in Shanghai are willing to withdraw, but do not want to leave Shanghai first. When this statement was posed to an Italian military officer, the reply was that from now on, the Italian side would not release any information to the press.</p>

<p>Recently, various anti-British leaflets have been found repeatedly in this port, posted on streets and telephone poles. The Zi Lin West Newspaper reported yesterday that the printed matter issued by the so-called "Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Expulsion of British People Association" depicted a map of Shanghai and the defense fleets of the British, American, and French forces at the top, and indicated that British soldiers would soon be driven out of Shanghai, followed by a "Another Warning to Britain" and a signed name. The source of the leaflets is still unclear.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Thugs Who Attacked This Newspaper Will Be Sent to Court Today; Thugs Fully Confessed After Interrogation; Police Released the Investigation Process of This Case <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The English-language Greater American Evening Post reported that, according to a statement released by the Public Concession Police, the bombing of the Shenbao Building on Tuesday morning was carried out by members of the "East Asia Anti-Communist League." In this atrocity, one person was killed and 18 injured. According to the police report, the suspect Huang Biaoqing (transliteration), who was arrested near the Shenbao Building during the attack, confessed to the police about the attack and admitted his part in the case, and demonstrated to the police.</p>
<p>Three Others Came; One Was Arrested</p>
<p>According to the police report, one of the bombers was arrested by a plainclothes police officer from the Old Zhabei Police Station as the three attempted to escape along Shanxi Road near Jiujiang Road. When he was taken to the police station, a vaccination certificate was found on his person, with the following Chinese sentences written on the back: "Chen Yiyou (transliteration), No. 20 Guihua Lane (transliteration) near Lafayette Road, Caishi Road, French Concession, I want to borrow some money from you. I don't know if you are willing. How much do you want? A few days later." Next to Huang was also a red piece of paper, obviously torn from another large piece of paper, with the Chinese characters "East Asia Anti-Communist League" written on it. In addition, there were 16 yuan in cash.</p>
<p>Careful Interrogation; Direct Admission</p>
<p>The suspect confessed that his name was Huang Biaoqing, also known as A Biao, 33 years old, from Ningbo, unemployed, and lived at No. 10 Yongfu Lane (transliteration), Glock Road. When first interrogated, he denied having done anything in the case, but after a few hours of careful interrogation, he confessed about it and made a statement. He claimed that for the past two years, he had been working in various teahouses and living with his mistress at No. 10 Yongfu Lane, Lane 118, Glock Road, French Concession. At the end of June this year, he met his friend Chen Changgong (transliteration), who invited him to join the "East Asia Anti-Communist League" as a "member." On July 8, he met this person again on North Henan Road and agreed to join the "League." This person led him to a place on Feihong Road in Zhabei and introduced him to two members of the "League" named Sun and Liu. They especially made him a member and told him that he could get a subsidy of 40 yuan per month, and told him to go to the "League" every morning. On July 9, he went there again and Chen Changgong gave him a badge. He then went there every day.</p>
<p>First Came to Inspect; Bombing the Next Day</p>
<p>On July 14, he was told that they would bomb the Shenbao Building. The next day, he and Chen went to inspect the Shenbao Building. On the afternoon of July 15, he, Chen, Liu, and Sun gathered in Room 7 of the Xin Luming Hotel at No. 25 Shanxi Road and discussed in the room. Chen Changgong brought four hand grenades to the hotel. On the morning of July 16, he and Zhang each took two hand grenades and left the hotel together. Sun and Liu followed closely behind. The hand grenades were wrapped in newspapers. The arrested person and Chen walked along Shanxi Road to Hankou Road, and then from Hankou Road to near the Shenbao Building, each person a short distance apart. The arrested person was then at the north end of the road. He saw Chen throw the two hand grenades in his newspaper package into the glass windows of the Shenbao Building and immediately turned and fled. He also opened the hand grenades in the newspaper and pulled out the fuse, throwing two grenades at the entrance corner of the Shenbao Building. He then fled westward, turned north on Shanxi Road, but was caught by a plainclothes police officer. As for the whereabouts of Chen, Liu, and Sun, he did not know.</p>
<p>Demonstration After Arrest</p>
<p>The suspect led the detectives to the above-mentioned hotel, where the teahouse waiter proved that the arrested person had been staying in the room opened at 2:00 PM on the 15th. He then led the detectives, together with detectives from the French Police Station, to his residence and found the badge he had described. The badge had the words "East Asia Anti-Communist League" written on it, and the number 1093 was engraved on one side of the back. The arrested person was then taken to the vicinity of the Shenbao Building, where he re-enacted the circumstances of his crime. He is now being detained at the Central Police Station and will be sent to court for trial on the 19th (i.e., today).</p>

<h3 id="e48">Yunnan-Burma Road is Blockaded; China-Soviet Union Highway is Open; The Road Transports 3,000 Tons of Military Supplies Monthly; China's Source of Military Supplies is Still Endless <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>After several brewing sessions, the news of the British and Japanese negotiations in Tokyo on the blockade of Yunnan-Burma traffic problems has been heard again, and it has been settled by compromise. Britain believes that it is in a dangerous situation in Europe, so it tries its best to avoid all possible new disputes and make its position more difficult. In addition, the Mini Cabinet, which relies on the British and Americans, has collapsed, and it is deeply feared that Konoe will take the stage and make even more demands. Therefore, on the eve of Konoe's cabinet formation, it hastily sang with Japan and cast a serious mistake. Although the Chinese side quite understands Britain's difficulties, it cannot tolerate this act of violating international obligations. However, in fact, before the rainy season on the Burma Road, the Chinese side had made preparations for military supplies long ago and had no fear. Moreover, with the Yunnan-Burma Road closed, the China-Soviet Union Highway, the international artery in the northwest, is still unobstructed, and its position is becoming more and more important and is attracting worldwide attention.</p>
<p>Transportation Situation on the China-Soviet Union Highway</p>
<p>The China-Soviet Union Highway stretches across northwest China for 2,500 miles, and the area it passes through has vertical and horizontal mountains, which takes time to transport, and the consumption of gasoline is huge. Therefore, in the past, the China-Soviet Union Highway was only limited to transporting military supplies. According to Japanese reports, the road transports 3,000 tons of military supplies per month. The goods transported from China to the Soviet Union mostly take the road through 　 and are transported to Hong Kong and then to Vladivostok or various Soviet ports in the Black Sea. In the future, heavy-duty vehicles traveling to various 　 in the southwest will not be difficult to change to the northwest, so China's source of military supplies will remain continuous. However, the export of tung oil and 　 sand will inevitably be stopped due to the heavy weight. This is because there is a relationship of repaying American debts with goods, so the United States first suffered losses, and tung oil is also necessary for American industry. Therefore, the US government is firmly 　　 against the blockade of Yunnan-Burma traffic.</p>

<p>According to Xiangren who came to Shanghai, early rice in Jiaxing Zhoupu and its near suburbs can be harvested, and the grains are like pearls and the grass stalks are thick and large. The villagers are all smiling and preparing to harvest. As for the late rice, it is being sown and inserted. Recently, because the rainfall is uniform, the farmland has no sense of lack. It is said that although the amount of early rice is quite fresh, it has a great relationship in regulating the entire people's food in Shanghai. Moreover, the collection and transportation are more convenient. At that time, general sales merchants will go to each production area to purchase a large amount and transport it to Shanghai for relief. It is also learned that the source of foreign rice continues to arrive. Of the 10,000 tons ordered by the rice industry, most have been loaded on wheels and are on their way to Shanghai and will arrive in succession around the end of the month. Also, the first batch of broken rice ordered by the Ping Tiao Committee will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Briquette Trade Association has been handling the seventh phase of subsidized coal briquette sales. Since sales began on the 10th of this month, a total of 11,500 dan of coal briquettes have been sold, with a value of 69,000 national currency. This phase of subsidized sales is scheduled to end as planned. It is reported that the source of coal dust has been increasing recently, and the production price has also decreased. Therefore, the manufacturing cost of coal briquettes has been reduced compared to before. The selling price of non-subsidized coal briquettes urgently needs to be reduced. The Coal Briquette Association will hold a meeting to discuss the continuation of subsidized coal briquette sales and the reduction of the market price of non-subsidized coal briquettes.</p>

<p>The Continental Press reports that yesterday (the 17th), the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department disclosed that Hou Yanli, a guest at a certain number of the Dahua Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road, was assassinated on the afternoon of the 16th at 9:30 pm, due to a drastic shake-up in the controlling class of gambling dens in the badlands of western Shanghai. Chinese people who controlled the gambling dens in this city have recently fled Shanghai due to life-threatening situations. Hou Yanli was one of them, but he failed to escape and was shot dead by three assassins. It is said that the former head of the gambling den "management office" was forced to flee after pocketing a portion of the gambling den's profits for himself. Hou Yanli colluded with him and was "punished" by the badlands side. It was also rumored yesterday that the "Municipal Government" had ordered all gambling dens in the badlands to close for three days. It is widely believed that the gambling dens will temporarily close until the new "management office" hands over the demanded "protection fee" before reopening. According to reliable sources, the gambling dens had recently temporarily closed and then reopened after paying a "fee" of 100,000 yuan each. There are currently nine large gambling dens and three small gambling dens in the badlands. Although yesterday was close to the reported closure time, the gambling business was still booming.</p>

<p>Pan Juquan (22 years old), a sand turner from Wuxi, was wandering around due to his dissolute nature and recent unemployment, leaving him homeless. At around 4:00 pm on the 10th of this month, he met Xue Sanbao, also a sand turner from the same hometown, near Yuezhou Road. Xue, a former colleague, invited him to Xue's house at No. 3, Lane 288 on the same road for dinner. That night, he temporarily stayed on the third-floor loft. Xue's wife, Yan, also from Wuxi, knew Pan Juquan, so they slept together on the floorboard. At 2:15 am, Xue Sanbao, feeling unusually hot, sneaked down from the loft to cool off in the alley at the back door. Unexpectedly, Pan Juquan took the opportunity to remove Yan's underpants and commit adultery. Yan, in her sleep, thought it was her husband Xue Sanbao having sex with her. After a while, she realized it was not her husband and shouted. Xue heard the sound and rushed over, seeing Pan Juquan on top of Yan. He was furious and slapped Pan. Pan, in a panic, put on Yan's pants and ran down the loft. Xue chased after him, grabbed him, and beat him severely. Pan Juquan, feeling resentful, reported to the Huishan Patrol Room, crying that Xue Sanbao had beaten him without cause. Later, Chinese and Western detectives discovered that the pants he was wearing were female's. After questioning, they learned the truth and sent both Pan and Xue to the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Patrol Room, filed a public prosecution against Pan and Xue for rape and assault. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody pending the arrival of Xue and Yan to testify. Yesterday morning, Magistrate Huang Risheng presided over the third criminal court and, after hearing the case, sentenced Pan Juquan to one year and six months of imprisonment. Xue Sanbao's assault case was not accepted, and he was immediately released.</p>

<p>The Quan'an Tea House downstairs from the Quan'an Bubble Water Hall at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Xinzha Bridge in the Public Concession is operated by Zhu Shunxing (50 years old) from Nanjing. At around 5:00 am yesterday morning, three robbers suddenly arrived, using pistols to threaten silence. One robber stood guard at the door, while two robbers went straight up to Zhu's sleeping quarters on the overpass loft, intending to search and rob. The victim, in a panic, escaped from the small door of the hall that leads to the Yifeng Cigarette and Paper Shop in front, shouting for robbers.

<p>Chen Ruihua, a staff member of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. at No. 27 Beijing Road, a Ningbo native, 20 years old, residing at No. 32, Lane 88, Connaught Road, colluded with his cousin Lu Ruixin in April of this year to embezzle 750,000 yuan in company funds to be used as seed money for speculative ventures. The Chinese manager Pan Zhiquan discovered this and reported it to the Central Patrol Room, which sent Chen and Lu to the First Special Court for prosecution on charges of embezzlement. Later, due to a settlement in the ancillary civil lawsuit, the plaintiff was unwilling to pursue the matter. Judge Qian sentenced Chen Ruihua to two years of imprisonment for continuous use of forged private documents, while Lu Ruixin was found not guilty. Chen refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court. Yesterday, Judge Zhou opened the first criminal court to hear the case. The appellant Chen Ruihua stated in his testimony: "I did not intend to embezzle, but to misappropriate temporarily as speculative capital. Later, I failed, and after being discovered by the manager, I tried to repay it. The trial judge in the first instance believed that I was involved in speculative ventures and was not a good person, so he sentenced me to two years of imprisonment. I am not willing to accept this and appeal to your court, asking the judge for leniency." After reviewing the evidence, the court ordered a change of date to await verification and then adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Sichuan Province's New County System Implemented Smoothly; Actively Training National Education Teachers; Appropriately Increasing the Salaries of Elementary School Teachers <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>(Chengdu Airmail) The Central Government promulgated the outline of county-level organizations to promote local autonomy. Sichuan Province first implemented it on March 1 of this year. Because Chengdu has more abundant funds and manpower and made full preparations in advance, it was fully realized within March. The adjustment of the municipal government and Baojia organizations has been completed, and the central township schools and Bao National Schools have also been completed in sequence. As of the end of June, other counties and cities have also completed the county government and Baojia institutions successively. Therefore, as of the end of June, Sichuan Province's implementation of the new county system has been roughly completed in terms of organizational structure. Although personnel training has been partially started since May 1, the entire training work started on July 1. More than 20,000 people throughout Sichuan are being trained due to the implementation of the new county system. The popularization of national education in Sichuan is scheduled to begin on August 1 and be completed in three years. The Provincial Government established the Sichuan Provincial National Education Committee in early July to be responsible for promoting it. Premier Chiang Kai-shek of the Executive Yuan instructed that the new county system in Sichuan should be completed within three years. The planned work for the first year is progressing smoothly and is expected to be completed on schedule.</p>
<p>Civil and Education Commissioners Inspect Various Counties</p>
<p>In order to inspect the implementation of the new county system in various counties, the Provincial Government specially sent Hu Juewei, Commissioner of Civil Affairs, and Guo Youshou, Commissioner of Education, to depart from Chengdu on May 22 to inspect eastern, northern, and southern Sichuan. They returned to the province on June 28, lasting 37 days. They traveled through 22 counties and cities, gave 36 speeches, explained the government's essentials and detailed methods for implementing the new county system, and attracted more than 35,000 listeners. Overall, the implementation of the new county system in various places has achieved generally good results. Commissioners and county heads have worked extremely hard to promote the new system, especially in the 10th and 11th districts, where the results are the best. The 10th district established township offices on June 1 and decided to establish central township schools and Bao National Schools uniformly starting from September 1. The 3rd and 7th districts also convened administrative meetings and decided to establish one central school in each township and one national school in each Bao within one year. Regarding township Bao issues, the 6th, 10th, and 11th districts have formulated specific plans and are actively promoting them. The 3rd and 7th districts have the largest number of training classes in each district. Township chiefs, section chiefs, and financial personnel have been convened for training, totaling more than 600 people. The educational qualifications of the students are better in the 3rd district, with more than 40 university graduates and 50 vocational school graduates. The discipline and spirit of the students are best in the 7th district. The progress of primary and secondary schools in various places is very slow, especially in the counties along the Chengdu-Chongqing Road. The salaries of elementary school teachers have been increased considerably, but they still feel that life is difficult. Currently, the 3rd, 10th, 7th, and 11th districts plan to provide all teachers in central and national schools with 3 shi dou of rice per month in addition to their prescribed salaries starting from the next semester. Civil servants below the township level will also receive the same treatment. A few counties have already started implementing it. If other places can follow suit, the salary problem of elementary school teachers and low-level civil servants can be easily solved. Among the counties' secondary schools, except for girls' schools and a few public and private secondary schools that are better, the rest should strive to enrich and improve. After a short rest, Hu and Guo will go to various counties in western Sichuan to inspect.</p>
<p>Training 17,000 Teachers</p>
<p>In order to implement the new county system and promote national education, the counties of Sichuan Province will set up short-term Bao National School Teacher Training Classes starting from July 1 to rush to train national education teachers. The training period is two months of summer vacation, from July 1 to August 31, and one month of winter vacation, with different dates. Each class has about 100 people. The first phase of the training will involve more than 17,000 teachers throughout Sichuan, with a total of 170 classes. The cost of each class is 4,000 yuan, totaling 680,000 yuan, which will be paid by the province. The selection of trainees is based on selecting the best from among private school teachers and intellectuals in various counties. The county head兼任s as the head of the short-term class, and the principal of the county normal school or other secondary school principal, or the section chief or superintendent of the county government serves as the deputy head. In addition to免收免收免收 all fees, students are also provided with subsidies. The training subjects include spiritual training, an overview of national education, administration of central national schools, an overview of local autonomy, teaching materials and methods for national language, arithmetic, music, physical education, labor, art, and other teaching materials and methods. After the training is completed, they will be assigned to various places to open national schools. If there are not enough people, it is planned to supplement them with teachers who have teacher qualifications or normal students and teachers from the war zone who have come to Sichuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in the HSBC listing. The unofficial British and American exchange market showed a state of hesitation, partly because people's minds were calm and interest in buying and selling was quite weak. Both bulls and bears took very little action, waiting for changes next week. The exchange rate fell early in the morning, reaching six and a half points, so after opening, it became a picture of a flat British pound and a tight American dollar. The trend was uncertain for a time, and the price continued to tighten. Later, Sassoon, Nikko, and China Bank stirred up selling, and the price returned to long positions. The US dollar once reached 6.25 yuan, and the British gold also reached three pence, nine three seven five. The afternoon closing was quite stable, and the market was quiet afterward. The amount released by China Bank and American Bank was just eaten up by speculators, with little fluctuation. As a result, British gold was three pence, nine two one eight seven five, and the American dollar was six yuan one eight seven five, each higher than the previous day's British and American prices by 0.015625 and 0.03125, respectively. Futures and spot prices were exactly the same.</p>
<p>Sassoon Sells Strongly</p>

The American against the British fell by six and a half points, against Shanghai it was down by a small five points, and there was no market against France. The central listing exchange rates remained the same. The bank opened the spot selling price in the morning at three pence, nine zero six two five for British gold and six yuan one two five for the US dollar, which was flat for British and tight for American by 0.03125 compared to the previous day's closing. This was due to the fall in the exchange rate. The market was uncertain after opening, and the price tightened slightly, which was beneficial to selling the August US dollar to foreign banks for 6.0625 yuan. The HSBC listing announcement did not move, and the white silver balance tax announcement increased by 1.25 percent. Subsequently, speculators and Sassoon China Bank came to sell, and the market turned loose. It is estimated that speculators and Sassoon mutually stuffed the foreign bank's July US dollar at 6.15625 and 1875, and China Bank issued the foreign bank's US dollar in the same month. Soon it had been made from 6.1875 yuan to 21875 yuan, and Sassoon had sold to American Bank for as low as 6.25 yuan. The first order was seen at three pence nine three seven five. After 10:30 a.m., Sassoon re-entered the August US dollar at 6.15625 yuan, as well as 125. The market had fallen back. The foreign bank had also entered Nikko's August US dollar, announcing 6.125 yuan, and speculators entered British Bank's August shilling at three pence nine zero six two five. The closing market was even more flat, with British gold at three pence, nine two one eight seven five and the US dollar at six yuan one five six two five, up 0.015625 for British and down 0.03125 for American compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>American Bank Also Has Supply</p>
<p>The market was quiet in the afternoon, and China Bank slightly released. American Bank also had the intention to supply. It is estimated that China Bank issued the July US dollar to speculators at 6.15625 yuan. American Bank sold the July US dollar, and the same was eaten by speculators at a price of 6.1875 yuan. The evening closing was three pence, nine two one eight seven five for British gold and six yuan one eight seven five for the US dollar, and three pence, eight nine zero six two five for August British gold and six yuan one two five for the US dollar, which was up 0.015625 for spot British and down 0.03125 for American compared to the previous day.

<h3 id="e76">The Gold Market Hesitates <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash bullion black market situation, although the trend was volatile, the scope was narrow and not very exciting. Operators' goals differed, and entries and exits were chaotic, rising and falling with the tightness and looseness of the exchange market. The foreign exchange was initially soft in the morning, and the opening was quite good at 5,270 yuan. Soon, gold and silver firms and securities firms fiercely stuffed, falling by about 100 yuan. However, money exchange firms took advantage of the cheapness and absorbed, and then rose to 5,260 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange firm vigorously sold, lowering the price by several tens of yuan. The afternoon closing was still announced at 5,230 yuan. Later, trading turned sparse, and the market was also flat, initially at 5,230 yuan. After the securities firm purchased some, it pulled to 5,245 yuan. The evening closing was announced at 5,240 yuan, only falling by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The total trading volume was about 2,000 taels. Silver building jewelry first fell and then rose, and as a result, there was no difference in honor or disgrace. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Bullion Fell by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, the market was stable due to the slightly tighter foreign exchange. The opening was raised by 20 yuan, and the silver firm issued gold firm twenty taels, for 5,270 yuan. Subsequently, the market was soft due to the easing of foreign exchange, which caused a selling trend. Securities firms and gold firms sold jointly, and soon silver firms also followed suit, and it was actually spat out to within 5,200 yuan. Silver firms mutually made ten taels, inferior to 5,170 yuan. Fortunately, a certain money exchange firm took advantage of the cheapness and absorbed, so it was able to return to the 5,200 yuan mark. Although a certain money exchange firm then profited and spat out, Nes held that foreign exchange reported softly, and the retail appetite was surprisingly strong. In addition, gold firms frequently bought, so it rose by several tens of yuan again. The gold firm entered the securities firm ten taels, rising to 5,260 yuan. The buying trend was slightly frustrated at noon, and the silver firm helped a certain money exchange firm to throw out a number, and then pressed down a small 30-40 yuan. The gold firm issued the silver firm ten taels, retreating to 5,225 yuan. Subsequently, the gold firm entered the silver firm thirty taels, for 5,230 yuan, as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the silver firm issued the gold firm ten taels, still for 5,230 yuan. Subsequently, the securities firm suddenly became interested in buying, and at that time a certain silver building also had a catch, and soon stepped up 15 yuan. The gold firm issued the silver firm twenty taels, for 5,245 yuan. Although a certain money exchange firm also came to absorb after entering, a certain gold firm had a strong intention to supply, and was finally pressed back five yuan. The gold firm issued the money exchange firm fifty taels, for 5,240 yuan, as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell by 10 yuan compared to the previous day, and the whole day rose and fell by 100 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold firm's capital spleen gold was more than ten yuan higher than the bullion, and the buying was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was little trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry First Small then Large</p>
<p>At the beginning of the sale of gold jewelry per tael, Da Tonghang still suspended 540 yuan. At half past ten, it hung a small ten yuan, and at a quarter past eleven it returned to a high of ten yuan. There were no changes after this. It is estimated that Da Tonghang still suspended 540 yuan, and Xin Tonghang was similar to the above price, reducing the purchase by about 30 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's silk market was stable. Yokohama spot prices remained unchanged, and forward prices rose by 13 yuan. New York spot prices opened at the original price, with the near term rising by two cents and the far term rising by two and a half cents. Silk prices in this port were not very uniform. White factory seven or eight points, Japanese merchant foreign firms entered at 4370 yuan, and British and French foreign firms entered at 4700 yuan. The difference between the two was 330 yuan. The former was mostly impounded goods, so manufacturers could only endure the pain of delivery. The entry price of British and French foreign firms was a normal transaction. The comparison of the two prices before and after has fully proved that the future of China's silk industry is hopeless.</p>

<p>Yesterday's unofficial market conditions for unified government bonds were such that news from all parties was silent, and the surrounding situation seemed chaotic again. After several days of soaring prices, the prices of various bonds had risen to a peak, and the general floating short positions were profitable, so many people sold one after another, but the demand of large households was not as eager as in the previous few days, and most of them carefully selected purchases, so speculators took the opportunity to be active and sold in large quantities, so that the market atmosphere was tired and declined. When it opened in the morning, the trend was still firm because Xinfu Hongda No. 64 Gongmao and others were quite interested, but Tongkang Jiufeng Dafeng Shengyu Xing Datong and others came out one after another to sell, so the market state lacked the strength to stabilize, and then gradually fell. The situation in the afternoon was still not strong, and there were more sellers on the counter, so Defu Hongda Taifeng Tongyu continued to spit out, and only Jiufeng Lianyi Sheng Darunli slightly purchased, but the market was quiet and not as prosperous as in the morning. The result was roughly closing at the lowest price, with a drop of one jiao to four jiao, etc. compared to the previous day. The turnover decreased sharply, only about one million yuan.</p>

<p>The yarn market is calm, and the overall trend remains in a state of hovering. This is because after the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian were blocked, transportation in eastern Zhejiang was completely suspended, and the sales of yarn were greatly affected. However, shipments to Hong Kong in South China were difficult, and they are now being changed to small ports to be transferred to the interior, so Hong Kong traders have made some fragmented purchases. People's minds are stable, and the bulls are not in a hurry to close, and the market is even quieter.</p>
<p>The opening of the current yarn market in the morning was lackluster due to the weakness of the overseas cotton market and the lack of significant changes in foreign exchange rates. 20-count Double Horse opened at a small price of 935 yuan, a drop of five or six yuan from the previous day. Subsequently, it fell slightly to 932 yuan, hovering at the price of 35-36 yuan for a long time. Later, it was heard that Hong Kong traders' actual sales were slightly more active, which was more active than the previous day, and the buying sentiment was strong, gradually rising to 948 yuan. The market recovered and fell back at the close. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 1,810 bales were traded, and the 20-count Double Horse price rose by 3 yuan. 180 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each trader is listed below:</p>

<h3 id="e80">Two Spot Cotton Transactions <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Spot cotton transactions still have sporadic transactions, which are just embellishments from all parties. Indian cotton, which had risen for two consecutive days, fell back, which affected people's minds again. At the same time, the yarn market was also mediocre, and only traders had two transactions. The price of fire engine grass bales was 151 yuan, and traders entered 150 bales. Another 150 yuan, traders entered 200 bales, all of which were delivered at the stack.</p>
<p>In other news, overseas cotton prices in the New York cotton market initially fell due to the closing of long positions and the selling of the public, and later due to the weakness of Wall Street. As a result, the closing prices in the near term rose by 17 and 27 pound notes, and the far term fell by seven or eight pound notes. Indian yesterday opened a forecast drop of seven or eight rupees.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market has been quite lively in recent days. Factory stocks are thin, and buying intentions are strong, but because yarn prices have not soared, there have only been continuous slight purchases. Therefore, it is generally expected that raw cotton will be in short supply in the future, and will be more promising.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Piece Goods: Cloth Sales are Narrow; White Goods Sales Prices Decline <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday, the market continued to be weak because sales were too narrow, and囤户's buying intention was sluggish, and sales prices gradually declined. The price of each piece of white goods, coarse and fine twill, fell by 2.5 to 5 jiao again. Dyed cloth had little ups and downs. The demand in various parts of Suzhou and Zhejiang was relatively strong, so the wholesale transactions in this street were quite prosperous. The number of transactions was about 300 pieces of cloth. Guangdong and Hong Kong traders purchased more than 200 pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, fine cloth, twill, etc. Yantai traders in the north purchased more than 100 pieces of twill velvet colored cloth, colored twill, etc.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The market was stable, but Longtou fine cloth increased stack rent, and there was a distinction between new and old stack receipts. The new stack receipts once rose to 29.7 yuan at the morning opening, and 29.6 yuan at the close. The old stack receipts hovered between 28.8 and 9 jiao. Four Gentlemen serge was 8.625 to 625 jiao per yard, and the sales of middle-grade fine cloth and fine twill were still sluggish, and there were few sales.</p>

<p>Gauze is used for mosquito nets in summer, and it is currently in the peak sales season, but current market transactions are limited, because most of them are directly ordered by carpentry and foreign goods traders. It is found that only a few nihong stores sell it, such as Yikang, Xinfeng, and Hefeng. The average wholesale price is about 5 yuan per yard. Ruikang Tianyuhua old-brand gauze is only sold by western-style carpentry shops such as Taichang Mao and Quantai.</p>

<p>The rice market has been selling well since prices fell sharply in the previous dynasty, and then suddenly rebounded. Yesterday, the surge of foreign rice in large quantities and the heavy silver capital and other problems caused another violent decline. When the market opened early in the morning, the general inland rural clients and the appetite of the shops in this street were still hoping for good, and there were still many people who wanted to start purchasing first, so the market was quite firm and there was no change. No. 1 Chen Saigon still opened at 56.5 yuan, No. 2 at 53.5 yuan, Fire Mark at 55.5 yuan, and Small Jiao at 54.5 jiao. But later, it was expected that customers and vendors would have more hand goods, and they urgently needed flexible silver capital. Taking advantage of this tight file, they suddenly poured out a large number of spot goods. For a time, the market was flooded with goods. The general guests felt caught between a rock and a hard place, and they were dumbfounded and helpless. They stopped buying, so the overall situation was only out and not in. Although it was supported by buyers, it was eventually unable to last, and the market prices of various foreign rice fell section by section. By the close of the market, the price had fallen by about 2 yuan compared to the previous closing price. It is estimated that No. 1 Chen Saigon was only 55 yuan, No. 2 was 52.5 yuan, 52 yuan, No. 1 Siam was 55 yuan, No. 2 was 52 yuan, 51.5 yuan, Fire Jiao was 54 yuan, Hong Kong Tip was 53.5 yuan, and then to 50 yuan, Small Jiao was 53 yuan, Tokyo Tip was 48.5 yuan, and then to 46.5 yuan, Coarse Tip was 44-5 yuan, Cui Tip was 41.5 yuan, and then to 39 yuan, Mi Lu was 43.5 yuan, 42.5 yuan, and the price of Lu goods loaded on June 26 was still 62.5 yuan in the early market, and then from 62.2 jiao, it decreased to 61 yuan, and compared to the 63.5 yuan on the previous day, it was a decrease of 2.5 yuan, and the price of 20th loaded rice initially opened at 62.2 jiao, and then from 61.7 jiao and 61.6 jiao, it decreased to 61.2 jiao, which was also 2 yuan less than the price of 63.5 yuan on the previous day. The situation was still weak, and the market was not easy to stand up.</p>
<p>Foreign rice continued to arrive in Shanghai. The Taigu Company's Taiyuan wheel arrived in Shanghai at noon, with 19,721 bags of foreign rice loaded from Hong Kong. It was docked at the company's pier on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading.</p>
<p>Although the sales of glutinous rice are not smooth, there are not many goods on the market, so it can stand up better, with only a rise and fall of 3-4 jiao. It is estimated that Jin Li Te Yuan opened at 63.2 jiao, 62.7 jiao, and Chang Dan Bai Yuan at about 61 yuan. However, Hong Kong foreign glutinous rice is different from domestic goods. Only foreign rice is the leader, so the market line is based on the situation, and it only opened at 60 yuan and 59 yuan.</p>
<p>There are still more than 1,000 bags of domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica arriving, and the off-site black market transactions are said to be still sparse. The owners are not easy to transport, and they are still persisting for their own benefit. The purchase price of high-quality goods has only been slightly reduced by half a yuan. The price of secondary goods seems to have depreciated more heavily. Changbang Te Qing Japonica is 66-7 yuan, Kun Chang Su Bai Japonica is high from 65-6 yuan, and the secondary goods are 60 yuan. Qing Si Thin Rice is 65-6 yuan, and the secondary goods are 62-3 yuan. Nanhai Early Rice is 61 yuan, 60 yuan, and the bushel is 57-8 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's flour was weak and sluggish, because sales streets needed it, and it retreated as soon as it moved. The customers, such as those in North China, were affected by the dumping of foreign flour, and there was no hope of development. Since domestic flour can be supplied to Shanghai from source, it is sold at the same time as Japanese factory flour, so the market is weak. The unified market only opened more than 1,000 bags of August Phoenix Flour, and the price was 15 yuan, which was another jiao less than before. The prices of other domestic miscellaneous brand flour also eased in secret. However, the raw materials of China Factory flour are strictly controlled and not easy to purchase, so the factory price is still the original price of 16 yuan. About 7-8,000 bags were wholesaled by the two factories.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat transactions were quiet, but the arrival in Hongkou was still strong. It was heard that the purchase price of China Factory was 23.3-4 jiao, and the purchase price of Japanese Factory was only about 22 yuan, with a difference of one yuan and several jiao across the river.</p>

Recently, 屯户, in view of the decline in lump coal, also took advantage of the high price to get on the market, and the current goods suddenly flooded. The same industry from the car stack bill, each ton is 210 yuan, and there are also transactions. The shop in this street is still holding the original price because the cost of the old goods is high.</p>

It is found that the previous market price of black big pepper and No. 1 pepper was the same at 106 yuan, and it has now dropped to 103 yuan. The trading is still possible. However, the bottom stock of white pepper is relatively thin, and it is quite firm. For example, the price of Wen Island goods is 202 yuan, and the price of Dutch goods is 190 yuan.</p>

<p>Raw Oil: Recently, the oil market has been blocked except for the iron bucket oil from Dalian that is allowed to pass. Relying only on the few movements of the gardens and workshops in this street, the trend has become increasingly unfavorable, and the market price has fallen step by step. Yesterday, only peanut oil was traded by Muji Street, with 100 pieces of Jiaozhou current oil and 1,000 pieces of road goods, and the prices were all 57 yuan. 100 pieces of Yantai oil were also priced at 57 yuan, 60 barrels of Qingdao oil were priced at 86.5 yuan, and 30 barrels of Tianjin oil were priced at 81 yuan. The market prices have fallen by 2-3 yuan across the board. In addition, 1,295 listens of raw oil will be shipped to Hong Kong today.</p>
<p>Bean Cake: The potential still shifts according to the weather. It rained overnight, and it cleared up this morning, so people's hearts were excited again, and market prices continued to increase by 2-3 jiao. The purchases were still made by various traders in South China and inland, and a total of 7,000 pieces of Dayou Four Brand Cake were traded, and the price is detailed in the market price column. 4,000 pieces of Shengji Cake, two cars of Feizi Cake, two cars of Yuanlong Cake, and 1,000 pieces of Qingzhong Cake.</p>

<p>Since the traders from other places reduced their purchases sharply, and the number of purchases made by the building traders in this street was also small, the market was quite sluggish, and people's hearts also turned soft. The standard market price initially fell from 1,400 yuan to 1,300 yuan, and then to 1,250 yuan. It was found that the shouting price of the market yesterday was only 1,200 yuan per ton (this is a 24-point pattern), and the coarse goods of 5 points to 1 inch also fell from 1,350 yuan to 1,250 yuan, and then to 1,200 yuan.

<p>The market for the factory's round nails, which had been sluggish for a long time, has still not improved recently. The widest sales areas in the South Seas Islands and Hong Kong have been closed, and the traders in the ports of North China and the traders in the Yangtze River, Ningbo, and Fujian have no time to absorb them, so the market is quite depressed and people's hearts are also declining. Therefore, sales prices are also calm and lifeless, and the shouting price yesterday was 45-6 yuan, and the transactions were only with building traders and sporadic.</p>

<p>A Fortuitous Coincidence</p>
<p>A man named Jia from Tianchang was betrothed to a woman from the same village, surnamed Mou. Due to poverty, he could not settle down to farming and became a soldier in a certain military camp. Later, he became a household servant for a certain committee member. Over ten years passed without news. His fiancée's family, unable to wait any longer, married her off to a man named Yi. When Jia learned of this, he devised a plan: He pretended to be a household servant from the county government, dispatched to Tianchang County to deliver official documents. He took the opportunity to go home briefly, acting as if he was in a hurry and couldn't stay long. He anticipated that his fiancée's family, seeing him still alive and working for the county government, would be afraid and ask someone to intercede. With his plan set, he dressed accordingly and set off. Upon arriving home, he stayed for one night and then prepared to return to the county to deliver the documents. His fiancée's family, seeing him still alive and an official follower, was indeed very frightened! They immediately asked village elders to persuade Jia to stay. Jia refused, but they pleaded with him repeatedly until he finally agreed. The elders prepared wine and food to entertain Jia, being very solicitous. While drinking, Jia deliberately spoke boastfully. Before long, one of the elders raised his cup to Jia and said, "Please finish this cup, as I have something to tell you." Jia accepted and drank it dry. The elder said, "Today's gathering is actually hosted by your fiancée's father. He then recounted the entire story of the other marriage to Jia, explaining that the fiancée's father had acted rashly and regretted it immensely. However, since the matter had already reached this point, there was no turning back. They now proposed to find another wife for Jia, namely Yi's younger sister, who was just reaching marriageable age and was more beautiful than the previous fiancée. If Jia agreed, they would arrange the wedding that very evening. All the betrothal gifts and wedding expenses would be covered by the former fiancée's father, without Jia having to spend a single penny." Jia was overjoyed and agreed to the proposal.</p>

<h3 id="e92">No Salvation Apart From Jesus <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Peter, in the name of the Lord Jesus, commanded a lame man to rise and walk, and he entered the temple with him, matching the true God. There are many people in the world today who are lame and need a helping hand to lift them up to worship and praise God. Peter did this, and he was questioned by the local officials. He attributed the glory to the Lord Jesus, saying, "This man stands before you healed because of the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead." He also said, "There is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."</p>
<p>There is no name in heaven or on earth greater than the name of Jesus. He is God and also man, overcoming nature and death, such as feeding five thousand people with five loaves of bread and two fish, calming the wind and waves, and rising from the dead. Once, a Muslim said to a Christian, "Our Muslim religion is much better than Christianity." The Christian asked him, "Why?" He said, "We went to the city of Mecca and found the dead bones of our leader to commemorate; you Christians went to Jerusalem, but you cannot find the dead bones of your leader Jesus to commemorate." The Christian replied, "Yes, you can find the bones of your leader because he is dead. We cannot find the bones of our leader because he is alive. He rose from the tomb on the third day, ascended to heaven, and intercedes for believers at the right hand of God." The leaders of all the world's religions have flaws, but Jesus has no flaws, no sins. Dr. R. E. Lea said that Jesus is an artist, a scientist, a botanist, a geologist, a historian, an optician, a worker, a farmer, and in short, He is a complete savior. Do you believe in such a complete savior?</p>
<p>When a person sins, there is no other medicine that can heal, only Jesus Christ can save. There is no salvation in anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.</p>

<h3 id="e93">The Reason for Robbery <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Liu</p>
<p>Passing by a small vegetable market, a group of people blocked my way. There was a commotion, and I didn't know what had happened.</p>
<p>At the center of the group was a woman, standing blankly with a basket of vegetables in her left hand. An old man beside her was advising her, "Go buy your vegetables, he won't return it to you!"</p>
<p>I was confused. As the crowd gradually dispersed, the old man who had been comforting the woman seemed to be deeply moved, so he spoke to one person after another. When he approached me, I impatiently asked him:</p>
<p>"What's wrong? What happened to this woman?"</p>
<p>"Robbed of her ring." The old man replied simply, then added a detailed explanation: "That woman was wearing a gold ring to buy vegetables, but it was still early, and not many vegetable vendors had arrived. At that moment, two robbers came and snatched the ring from her hand. They even lectured her, saying, 'Now people are starving and have no food to eat, yet you still wear a gold ring?' After saying that, they took the ring and left."</p>
<p>I listened attentively, thinking, "Now people are starving and have no food to eat, yet you still wear a gold ring." This is probably the "reason" for the robbery! I wonder what the woman who was robbed would say in response to this "reason"? I suppose she couldn't say anything.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: Robbery is illegal, so this "reason" is naturally invalid. But the fact that many people are starving is a fact, and the fact that some people hoard gold bars is also a fact.)</p>
<h3 id="e94">"The Five Ghosts Moving Treasures" <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Qiang</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>Please forgive my intrusion. I ask that you publish my following experience of being scammed in a corner of your esteemed publication, so that those in Shanghai who are as curious as I am will not suffer the same fate.</p>
<p>On the evening of ××, as I was passing through ×× Road, I happened to see a crowd of people of all ages standing around. In the middle was a "magic master" of some sort. A captivating magic picture was hanging on the wall. I asked this master to teach me the "Five Ghosts Moving Treasures" method, paying him two dimes. He then led me to a secluded place and said, "'Five Ghosts Moving Treasures' is not a trick or a spell, but a kind of talisman magic. Therefore, it cannot be taught on the spot. You must record your age and birthday, which he will process overnight. At ×× o'clock the next day, I could learn at the same place, but I could not discuss this matter with any friends that night." The next day, I went to × Road at the appointed time, and the master was already waiting. He began his deceptive and captivating performance (burning talismans and chanting spells). Then he said, "This Five Ghosts divine talisman is not a true god, so it must be wrapped together with five materials: gold, silver, copper, iron, and tin. Then you can take it home and hide it in a box. After an hour, you can take it out and perform the magic." However, I didn't have any gold or silver with me, so I discussed it with him. The result was that he said five yuan in legal tender would also work. I took out the five yuan from my pocket and put it in a matchbox with the talisman, wrapped it in leather paper, tied it with red silk, and handed it to him. At this time, my attention was entirely focused on the five yuan in legal tender. However, he hid the matchbox behind my back, on my waistband, and chanted, "I invite ××, I invite ××, I invite ××, ××× command to the west," reciting each line once. At the same time, he replaced the matchbox on my waist with a pre-prepared box that looked the same (pretending to secure it for me). At that moment, I mustered my courage, snatched back the box in his pocket, and hurried away. It is said that there are many people doing this kind of thing, please be careful.</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Qiang: If you had paid a little attention to the newspapers, you would have known this was a scam long ago. You say "there are many people doing this kind of thing," precisely because there are so many easily scammed people like you. But please forgive me, I am not blaming you for "being scammed," but for the reason you were scammed—curiosity contains an element of darkness. Let me ask you: Why didn't you learn "Flying Bird Cage" or "Flying Cards," but instead wanted to learn "Five Ghosts Moving Treasures"? Please answer me honestly, did you want to rely on this "magic" to obtain something unexpected? If so, then I advise you, such a brilliant "magic" would be kept secret for fear of being discovered, how could it be shared with everyone for the mere price of two dimes? Apart from ill-gotten gains, every penny earned requires considerable work, just as the five yuan in legal tender you were not scammed out of was not easily earned.</p>
<h3 id="e95">The Value of Stamps <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>Before the Central Bank issued fractional currency, there was a time when stamps were used in the market to replace copper coins because of the shortage of copper coins. You said broken stamps were worthless, and I said soaked stamps were worthless. The value of stamps was reduced, and one yuan in legal tender could be exchanged for 110 to 120 cents!</p>
<p>Now, stamps have been listed by some stores as something that can be profited from. Yesterday, I went to a tobacco and paper shop near me to buy a two-cent stamp because I wanted to send a letter. The shop assistant wanted three cents from me, and it was the same at another shop. Not long ago, the situation before and after was so different that I couldn't help but sigh!</p>
<h3 id="e96">Medicine Residue <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Written by: Cao Jian</p>
<p>In the alley, I often find piles of Chinese medicine residue. At first, I found it very strange. Why do people dump medicine residue in the middle of the road? Is there no trash can? If the trash can is placed far away, and they dump it on the ground out of laziness, then that would be a reason. Strangely, the place where the medicine residue is dumped is only a few steps away from the trash can. So why must the medicine residue be dumped in the middle of the road instead of in the trash can? This question has become an unsolvable mystery in my mind.</p>
<p>Once, when I was walking in the alley, I happened to see someone dumping medicine residue on the ground. I said to him, "Please dump the medicine residue in the trash can in the future, don't make the road so dirty." But as a result, I was met with his contempt and he scolded me a few times, telling me to mind my own business.</p>
<p>Later, I accidentally talked about this matter with a friend. He said to me, "This is Chinese superstition. They believe that if the medicine residue is dumped in the middle of the road, and pedestrians step on it, they will get the disease of the patient in their home, and the patient in their home will get better." I couldn't help but laugh when I heard my friend's words. Every day, countless people step on medicine residue, will the patient really get better like this? Will the person who steps on the medicine residue really get sick?</p>
<p>We must know that if we don't want to be invaded by disease, maintain a healthy body, and enjoy a happy life, then in addition to working hard to maintain our health, we must all strive to abide by public hygiene. Only if we all strive to focus on public hygiene is that a truly healthy path!</p>

<p>To whom it may concern, I recently read the news about scholarships for poor students in various newspapers, and the details were very detailed, which shows that the society is enthusiastic about cultivating poor children and has a lot of sympathy. At a time when life is expensive, it is not easy for poor children to aspire to study. In view of this, this office has launched the Gu Shu Ping Memorial Scholarship for junior and senior high schools since the spring of this year. The purpose is, on the one hand, to commemorate Mr. Gu Shu Ping's lifelong enthusiasm for charity and his untiring efforts to promote education; and on the other hand, to consider the difficulty of studying for poor and studious children, and to allocate funds to promote it. All poor high school students in the port, who are of exceptional character and academic performance, and who aspire to study but are not allowed by their family circumstances; or those who have dropped out of school, with proof from a formal school, and attaching a report card from the last semester or the previous semester, with a total average of 85 points or more, and detailed resume, the name and occupation of the parents, and family situation, and a recent half-length photo, send it to this office by registered mail for registration. After the investigation by this office, if the family circumstances are indeed poor and unable to afford tuition fees, then the examination will be conducted by this office. Once admitted, the student may study at the original school or choose a formal school in the port, and the tuition fees will be borne by this office, and the cost of books will be subsidized by this office according to the situation; the funds will be paid directly by this office, and no cash will be paid to the students, in order to be properly managed. In the spring of this year, the first phase of scholarship students admitted by this office totaled 42 people. In the last semester, the academic performance of each student was excellent, and the total average score of the school examination was mostly above 85 points, and even above 95 points. In order to encourage the first phase of scholarship students to study hard, this office will continue to provide scholarships to those whose academic performance is above 85 points and whose family circumstances are still unable to afford tuition fees. The second phase of scholarship examination has already begun, and the registration will be closed at the end of this month. There are already dozens of people who have registered. It is hoped that the details of the scholarship organized by this office will be revealed and introduced, so that poor and excellent children can obtain more opportunities to study.

<p>"Detective, I've finished my words, I'm going to the gatehouse."</p>
<p>Hawthorne suddenly waved his hand to stop him. "Wait, I still have something to ask you."</p>
<p>The doorman had to stop and turn around. Hawthorne sat down again and thought of his cigarette. He took out his cigarette case while speaking calmly.</p>
<p>"Old Mao, there are also things about yourself that you haven't told us."</p>
<p>Old Mao stuck out his tongue to lick his lips, his rat eyes changed repeatedly, then his eyes focused on Hawthorne's face, as if he couldn't understand the meaning of Hawthorne's words for a moment.</p>
<p>He asked back, "About me? What do you mean? Could it be that—could it be that I killed him?"</p>

<h3 id="e99">Kim Hyeseu's Thirteenth Birthday <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>Kim Hyeseu, this famous child star, recently starred in the 20th Century Fox film "High School," achieving outstanding results. Time flies quickly, and she is already thirteen years old this year, and her child star era is about to pass. Here are some words about her successful experience and the grand occasion of her thirteenth birthday:</p>
<p>Birthday Celebration</p>
<p>She went on the screen at a very young age, and now she is thirteen years old. This little girl is very likable both on and off the screen. Recently, when she held a thirteenth birthday celebration at home, people from the film industry came to congratulate her, and the grand occasion was unprecedented. One point that can be particularly mentioned is that she invited five children from outside the film circle to her home to participate in the grand event that day, and because of this invitation, these five children also went on the screen when 20th Century Fox filmed "High School," playing Kim Hyeseu's classmates.</p>
<p>Standard Movie Fan</p>
<p>Because every film she stars in is quite successful, the audience off-screen expresses their love for her. Usually, many movie fans also write letters to her constantly. Kim Hyeseu herself is not only a small star, but also a standard movie fan. When new films are released in Hollywood cinemas, she always takes the time to see them once. As long as she is not filming, most of her free time is spent in the cinema.</p>
<p>Good at Photography</p>
<p>Although she is only thirteen years old, she can also take photographs. She often carries an eight-inch quick-shot camera in her hand. When the company goes outside to shoot location scenes, she takes her camera and takes pictures of the scenery everywhere. When she comes back, she can always take a lot of photos, and the results are quite good. So some people say that Kim Hyeseu is also a female photographer!</p>
<p>Raising Animals</p>
<p>Kim Hyeseu's home has a lot of animals, from monkeys to chickens, she raises everything. She usually takes great care of them, and even feeds them herself. Toys, mechanical, clay, she has everything, and I don't know how many foreign dolls she has. She likes to read history books, and about saws, hammers, knives, and all kinds of nails, Kim Hyeseu has them all. She can make toys such as stools, building blocks, and small houses.</p>
<h3 id="e100">After Watching "Under the Eaves of Shanghai" <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuqing</p>
<p>This is a social drama written by Xia Yan for "Amateur" three years ago, and it is a super-special creation showing Shanghai. What the stage gives us is a one-story residential house, which is also the so-called "alley" house commonly seen in Shanghai. The people living in this house are of course cadres in the Shanghai social class. Because the social organization is unsound, there is also a single girl living a life of prostitution, a college student who is unemployed upon graduation, and a newspaper vendor who is huddled in the three-story attic who cannot lift his head. The story of the whole play unfolds in such an environment.</p>
<p>Judging from the achievements of the whole play, it can be said that it is really up to standard, but from my personal feelings after watching it, I think it is better for the co-faithful playwright to make a slight supplement to the mountain director, just like the college student Huang Jiamei living in the pavilion room, if his personality is changed to be more positive, then he will definitely be able to turn the exposure into an instruction, especially when the prostitute Shi Xiaobao on the front floor asks him to read the letter, he does not dare to resist her teasing. At the same time, it seems to be explained from this scene that her prostitution seems to be willingly indulging in depravity, not for the sake of life.</p>
<p>Another example is Zhao Zhenyu, a primary school teacher in the kitchen, whose attitude of going with the flow is also undesirable. His performance of adapting to the environment is precisely giving a great cover to the general people who lack hot blood. Needless to say, if he can explain to the newspaper vendor Li Lingbei the responsibility for the death of his son on the battlefield, I believe he will definitely be able to understand what the current war is for.</p>
<p>In the entire performance, the audience felt very satisfied. Especially worth mentioning is the device, yes, a whole house has never been seen on the Chinese stage before.</p>
<p>The actor who plays the primary school teacher, Su Dan, is the most qualified. Liu Daiyun is also good. Because Wan'er does not have the opportunity to act, so her acting skills cannot be seen. Bai Li's voice is a pity that it is too low. The rest are mediocre. Yan Jun's rogue is too lacking in strength, this may be less experience. It is worth not neglecting the little sister Shi Lingfang who plays Baozhen, she is indeed successful, and I wish this new artist to work hard.</p>

<p>— Written by Dong Yun, Illustrated by Xiu Yan</p>
<p>Ordinary tanci novels. The main characters are usually only two. For example, Fang Qing and Chen Cuie in The Pearl Pagoda, Tang Yin and Qiu Xiang in A Smiling Destiny, Zhou Xuewen and Lu Qingyun in Falling Golden Fan... There are countless examples like this.</p>
<p>But Describing the Golden Phoenix is an exception. The characters who appear on the stage, such as Xu Huilan, Jin Jichun, Qian Acui, Wang Xian, and Qian Duxiao, cannot be regarded as supporting roles in the book. The reason is that "Describing the Golden Phoenix" does not focus on narrow love between men and women. However, comparatively speaking, Xu Huilan and Qian Acui are the backbone of the book.</p>
<p>"Qian Duxiao Praying for Rain" is a famous section in Describing the Golden Phoenix—an interlude of jokes.</p>

<p>— Dong Yun</p>
<p>Shanghai opera is a kind of folk opera. Although the literati class derogate it as the sound of the lower class, there is no doubt that it can match the taste of Shanghai people.</p>
<p>Miss Xiuying is the youngest red artist in today's Shanghai opera circle. Her achievements should be attributed to "genius." Now, in addition to performing at the Chang Le Theater day and night, she has four broadcasting programs every day, and almost all of her time is spent on the singing stage. She has grown into a likable appearance. When performing on the red carpet, she is naturally "vivid"; and when meeting in private, she feels even more "gorgeous." In terms of appearance, she can cover Wang Yaqin and make Shi Xiaoying lose face; in terms of art, her voice and tone, learning from Xiao Yuezhen can be confused with the real, and his future achievements are definitely not limited to Xiao Yuezhen.</p>
<p>What is especially worth mentioning is that Miss is extremely clever. She can learn the new drama "Drilling the Pot" as soon as she learns it; she can memorize unfamiliar lyrics after a little reading. Her expressions are meticulous, and when performing a tragedy, her tears are really crystal clear, and the people on the stage are almost integrated with the people in the play.</p>
<p>She is only nineteen years old this year, and her achievements are not easy to achieve.</p>
