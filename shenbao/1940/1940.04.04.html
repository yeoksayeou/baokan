<p>社評</p>
<h3>兒童節感言</h3>
<p>「四四」兒童節的創始，到現在不過九年的歷史。每年這一天，各地皆有慶祝盛會，並有種種加惠兒童的措施。但是，逢節舉行的，除了一部分兒童自動之外，大多是敎育機關與文化團體所策動；至於一般社會，却似並大感受濃厚趣味，亦未產生何種反應。不但如此，除了節日之外，兒童運動似亦始終沒有像其他社會運動一樣被重視。以兒童的普遍，而兒童節與兒童運動的現象若此，除非說是因為九年的歷史很短，此外很難覓得仙種較可滿意的原諒之辭。</p>
<p>兒童是未來社會的主人，也就是國家根本命脈所在；尤其在一個存亡絕續除舊布新的轉換關頭，兒童問題是應該放在國策首位來考慮的。中國面臨着這樣一個非常時代，現在的一輩人正擔負着抗戰救亡的神聖偉業；但是關於未來的復興工作，必然的十百倍於今日抗戰的艱苦繁雜；這一重任，却早已注定要落到後一輩國民身上。將來他們能吾充分發揮偉大能力，在五千年的中華民族建國史上創造新的奇蹟，那便全要看今日之如何努力從事於對兒童的撫育與敎養。中國當局對於這一問題，自從戰爭開始之後，亦已相當注意到了；有如全國各地兒童保育所敎養所的設立，蔣委員長的一再通電嘉慰各地小學敎師，以及敎育當局對於兒童敎育家庭敎育的種種措施，無疑都是着眼於這一輩未來復興中國的生力軍。所以在慶祝兒童節的今天，除了形式上的種種慶祝措施而外。更應該嚴重考慮到如何使兒童連動與非常時期的偉大使命相配合。</p>
<p>第一，應該努力維護兒童的生存。在綿延將近三年的抗戰中間，正不知有多少天眞活潑的兒童犧牲在慘酷轟炸和無情砲火之下，又不知有多少生機蓬勃的兒童寃枉喪生於疾苦，也不知有多少美滿家庭的兒童在一刹那間變成孤苦流亡。這種國家民族的損失將永遠無法估計其如何鉅大。其中自然有一部分是屬於無法避免和補救的一類，但也必然有許多由於人力與人謀的缺憾。如果疏散和救護工作能更得力，一定可以避免許多的傷亡；如果難童保育工作能更普遍，一定也會替國家保存更多的元氣。即以上海租界而言，飢餓綫上的兒童不計其數，而每月工部局的死亡報告當中，嬰孩與幼兒死亡率又高得驚人。我們不禁要替這些小國民呼籲，希望各力加以深切關懷，好設法解決他們的保育問題。</p>
<p>第二，要加緊鍛鍊兒童們的精神堡壘。天眞純樸是兒童的特長，同時也等於一張白紙；得到優良正確的鍛鍊與薰陶，一定會形成健全堅毅的國民人格；如果不幸遭遇邪惡環境的沾染也會躭誤兒童一生的前途。在抗戰過程當中，最令人痛心的一幕，無過於把那些不能從淪陷區脫走的兒童更淪陷而成為侵略者的對象；每天灌輪奴化意識，塗染了他們潔白純凈的心靈。這是一種在武力侵略以上的最卑劣的罪惡，凡有正義感的人們，務必負起責任設法加以拯救。至於在內地，一切負有兒童敎育責任的人們，自然應該以鍛煉民族精神當作教育的第一要義。這是比較一切知識技能的灌輸更加重要的基本教育。</p>
<p>中國之有新式敎育，至今不過四十年的歷史，雖迄今尙多缺陷，但就對於國家民族一方面效果而論，已有顯著的成功，這只要把此次抗戰和甲午之役作一比較，便可明暸。廻想那四十年間的敎育，一方與悠久的黑暗時代相銜接，一方又要和醜惡的社會及不安的政治相搏鬥，其本身的歷盡磨折而難臻健全，自所當然，然對國家民族已有貢獻亦即國家民族已有收穫。足見敎育功能之偉大。今日的兒童一輩，生在這樣動蕩時代，飽受精神物質種種苦惱，固應算是不幸；但另一方面，他們所接觸的已不僅是課堂裏的訓話與課本上的知識，到是活生生的現實與切身生活的體騐；但看他們的一動一靜，一言一語，既與往昔大相逕庭。何况五千年古文化所遺留下的腐醜，已受了大時代的洗鍊，故在這一時代當中孕育出來的國民，在先天上實已遠較其前一代為俊秀健全。所以未來的建國工作，在本質上實已蘊藏着光明燦爛的前途；但一定還要在人事方面能夠針對現　需要盡到最大的努力、使兒童的保育和陶冶，都發揮出偉大功效。這是今日每一個中國人在努力抗戰以外的另一天職，也是在慶祝兒童節這一天所應特別注意的。</p>

<h3>對彰德反英暴動　日示歉意</h3>
<p>北平　三月十九日、駐北平英副頒事羅培與加拿大敎會人員二人在彰德調查敎會房產之毀壞情形時、遭遇有組織的反英示威運動、並有華人一羣衝入該三英人下榻之旅舍、向英副領事行兇　北平英大使館乃向日大使館提出抗議、責備日方保護不力、茲聞英當局已接得日當局對此「不幸事件」而表示之同悄、日軍發言人聲稱、渠對於此種事件之發生、感覺誠摯之遺憾云、故此間英大使館當局、刻已接奉對此事不再續取行動之訓令、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>外部致各國使節照會　蘇各報一致揭載　所謂「東亞新秩序」將遭大困難　中國人民決心抗戰必獲勝利</h3>
<p>莫斯科　游力報紙、一致揭載華外交部致各國使節、否認偽組織之照曾全文、蘇聯人士獲　偽組織成立後、莫不表示憤慨、並認偽組織僅為日本帝國主義者之工具、政界人士亦表示日軍建立所謂「東亞新秩序」、必將遭受極大困難、近日以來、蘇報不斷抨擊偽組織、此足證與論之所在、例如一月二十六日勞動報、刊有蘇維埃最高會議代表蘇伯勒夫之論文一則、內稱「吾人希望中國抗戰獲勝、蘇聯人民一致注意日本建立偽組織之策動、然余敢言此種滑稽戲劇、決將引起蘇方人士之憤慨、日本現正夢為東亞之主人、且以少數人之組織、威脅四萬五千萬人民」、三月二十五百之眞理報亦為文曰、「日本軍閥之所急欲建立偽組織者、係因其在佔領區內之地位、已不如以前之鞏固、故欲偽組織為之維持、杳偽組織之口號為和平反共、然自（一九三七）年以來、中國人民即知此口號之眞意、乃砍陷中國人民於奴隸地位、又昨日之眞理報、刋有檢討日本經濟困難之論文一則、內容多取材於美國之「國家週刋」、其結論有曰、日方近聲明不欲向華深進、此實非其政治上之智慧、而乃軍事上不得不如此也、日本雖尙未崩潰、然中國獲勝之機會、已較多於日本、偽組織決不能削弱中國人民抗戰之決心、（二日電）</p>

<h3>美為民意國譽　不得不考慮禁運　在華保有權利如遭蹂躪　卽可立卽採取報復手段</h3>
<p>紐約　紐約民聲講壇報、　就美日兩國關係、發表社評、　謂、美國亞洲艦隊前任司令雅納爾少將近談稱、日本在亞洲之冒險行徑、業已深入泥淖、倘再與美國作戰、不啻自殺、言下之意、乃關日本尚無自殺之準備、雅納爾少將初非危言聳聽之輩、其所表示之見解、吾人亦具有同感、至於美日商約失效以後、美國倘禁止若干種貨物運往日本、該國不致即用為宣戰之理由、殆無意義、但日本政府前曾聽任各報發表激烈文字、評論禁運問題、於以見美國國會若果通過禁運法案、日本輿論界自必堅決要求該國政府出以報復手段、屆時該國政府恐難予以拒絕、此則不可不加注意耳、即日本縱有採取報復之可能、吾人自未能因此而不考慮禁運辦法、美國人衡諸時局情形、民意新識與國家榮譽、倘以此為禁運辦法有不得不實施之道、則難以此項辦法所可引却之風險作為論據、而加以勸阻、恐亦無效、特美國人茍欲擔負此項風險、務必預事準備、並密切加以注視而後可、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　華盛頓日報云、「日本軍人倘迫令在精衛蹂躪美國在華現仍保有之權利、則美國政府自當向此保護周密之紳士、不斷提出照會、同時並向日本政府示意、告以美國可以禁止某某種貨物輸往日本、或可對於日本輸入美國之貨物、課以特稅、此兩種辦法、具有同時實施之可能」云、（二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>日報竟著論　責美武斷　以遠東困難局勢　不能打開相威嚇</h3>
<p>東京　日本某報頃發表一社評、將英·美兩大使在東京所表示之態度、為一比較、而認美國隊日本政策之態度、殊為「狂妄」、該報指陳、美國駐日大使格魯、對日本在華行動、發表激怒的語調、謂美國不自約束、竟企圖判斷日本之行為、美國若堅持此種態度、遠東之困難局勢、將長此存續而不能打開、美國誠係一味武斷、而不察實際者、該報又稱、英國雖與日本在華之活動不能合調、然能了解實際、並能研究其保障及發展利益應採取之立場、「南京新政府」似已「構成一重要之因素、而不能以任何反對之意見傾覆之」云、（三日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>政治攻勢　赫爾強硬宣言　予日重大打擊</h3>
<p>巴黎　「汪精衛政權」之成立頃由急進社會黨事業報加以評論「略謂」意大利政府於接獲「汪政權」通告之後、旦夕間即提出答案、是以日政府當局在昨日午前甚為欣幸、反之華盛頓消息則未足使東京方面感覺愉快、據吾人所知「汪政權」與日本政府之間、無日不發生困難、實際言之、汪方意欲日本代為綏靖中國、而日政府則祗圖自利、並限制「汪政權」之勢力、俾以各大城市為限、而不聽其擴張、職是之故、雙方對於權限問題爭持甚力、且互相以「斤斤於字面之爭」為對方詬病、迄至美國務卿赫爾發表宣言、聲明該國僅承認重慶國民政府之後、日本政府已受重大打擊、該國首相米內之左右尚存一種幻想、以為英法兩國或不致與美國持同一見解、特一部份報紙則並不作如是觀、且攻擊米內內閣對於「汪政權」亦不發表滿意、良以「汪政權」之成立、初非中國事變行將結束之謂、「各該報固知之甚諗也」云、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美艦在太平洋　舉行初步演習　海長愛迪生親行指揮　大批艦隊已駛夏威夷</h3>
<p>聖彼得羅　美國海軍「黑」「白」兩艦隊、已在太平洋某處舉行初步演習、大批艦隊已駛往夏威夷、於明朗天氣之下、開始一九四〇演習、當昨日清晨、艦隊即已魚貫前進、午夜初過、第一艘驅逐艦駛離桑狄哥港、其他三艘、緊隨於後、驅逐艦在港外靜候巡洋艦之駛出、列成隊伍前進、主力艦則最後離港、海軍部長愛迪生及美國艦隊總司令李查德孫一同在旗艦「賓夕法尼亞」號後甲板上指揮、聞大艦在夏威夷裝煤添水後、將分為「紫色」及「褐紅色」二艦、從事作大規模海軍演習、（三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>重慶　此間掃蕩報、頃著文評論美海軍大操、謂美海軍在太平洋之大操、實為對付南京偽府之一種姿態、並美國務卿赫爾、業已聲明不承認偽府、並同時指斥日本企圖獨占中國、以危害第三國之權益、故此次大操、足以表示三月三十日赫爾聲明之後、尚有美國之海陸空軍正在準備、亦可謂美國封鎖日本之序幕、並可認為美國加緊努力、鞏固太平洋之防禦、而使日本南進遭受嚴重之打擊云、（三日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>日將派加藤　赴中南美</h3>
<p>南京　日本報章載稱、日本赴華特使加藤外松、即將被任為中美及南美各國特使、日政府派加藤往中美及南美各國、與東京政府之改正經濟依賴美國及同時擴充日本與拉丁美洲各國商業之政策連繫、日本政府已努力促進日本與中美及南美各國之商務、阿根廷及秘魯經濟考察團最近訪問日本、墨西哥經濟考察團、亦在來日途中、加藤將於四月初離日赴美、（三日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>英駐日大使演說　引起下議員注意　自特勒氏答覆工黨詢問　英遠東政策根本無變更</h3>
<p>倫敦　英駐日大使克萊琪爵士、前於上月二十八日、在東京日·英協會聚餐會席次、所發表之演說、甚為下議院各議員所注意、下院本日午後開會時、工黨議員培克、曾提出詢問云、「克萊琪大使之演詞、是否政府在遠東現行政策、行將變更之謂、抑或政府仍擬澈底推行援助中國國民政府之政策、應請首相加以說明、」外次白特勒當即答稱、「哈里法克斯外相對於此項演詞、業已注意及之、吾國駐外使節、遇有此類情事、原無先將演詞內容、徵求外相同意之習慣、但哈里法克斯外相對於克萊琪大使所稱各節、仍準備擔負責任、該大使並請余代為聲明、渠本意初謂本國現行政策業已有何變更、或與政府所一再告諸下議院者、有何參差之處、於以見政府對於　續承認重慶國民政府為中國合法政府之見解、暨其對於遠東問題所持一般態度、初未有何變更、即政府願望遠東爭端、能依照公尤條件、獲有解決之心理、亦絕未有所改變、」（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日與德義西　暗中勾結　傳許予經濟特惠</h3>
<p>東京　朝日新聞　、義人對於上海天津·北平·與廣州公共汽車事業與道路計劃、有多數深切之注意者、今已繕就關於平津築路工程之計劃及上海市之交通程序、送呈在華之「中」·日當局、日方之經營此事者、現正對於義人之提議作友好之考慮、（三日路透社電）</p>
<p>巴黎　衆院昨日於討論汪精衛之「南京政府」成立事項後、延期本星期四開會、消息靈通方面謂、「南京政府」或可獲馬德里及羅馬方面之承認、而以在華之特惠經濟條件作為交換、據「巴黎晚報」稱、東京方面正對柏林施用壓力、以期避免與柏林及羅馬的友好關係之鬆弛、該報謂、蘇　外長莫洛托夫及德外長里賓特洛甫會晤時、若莫斯科方面保證於蘇芬戰事結束後、無加緊遠東軍事之意向、則東京亦可因此獲得保證、（三日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>義駐日大使　啟程返國</h3>

<h3>外國軍事專家聲稱　華軍作戰勇敢　克復崑崙關卒達到目的</h3>
<p>重慶　據目擊數月前華軍克復南甯東北要隘崑崙關情形之某外國軍事專家語人、謂中國士兵作戰之勇極堪欽佩、因該地為南甯之門戶、日軍駐有重兵扼守、華軍為企圖可復南甯計、猛力進攻、雖遭嚴重損失、卒達到克復目的、傳華軍進攻時曾損失坦克車九輛、惟據華軍宣稱、其中三輛業已奪回、該專家曾親見三坦克車拖回後方修理、該專家對於中國兵士之作戰精神、備致讚揚、而對於其中若干小隊之戰績、尤具深刻印象、彼意華軍當局不應僅提升各指揮官、或給予兵士現金、以為獎勵、更宜頒發勳章、以鼓勵下級將士、該專家認為華軍之進攻崑崙關、似缺乏「再接再厲」、此點在任何大規模軍事行動中、殊屬重要、倘使華軍能利用其已得之優勢、而續對敵軍加以打擊、則此戰之重要、必將更見偉大矣、該專家又評論日軍之進攻賓陽、謂此不過為襲擊性質、日軍派一旅之衆、作廣大之迂迴行動、以期挽救崑崙關之危急、然日軍此舉已稍嫌過遲、因日軍尚在採取攻勢之時、華軍已克復該關也、日軍雖在此情勢之下、仍繼續向賓陽前進、蓋此路日軍係屬襲擊部隊、並不企圖與後方維持連絡、故結果遭華軍之截擊、因華軍各部隊缺乏相當之一致行動、致大部份日軍仍得退向南甯云、（路透社二日電）</p>
<h3>張伯倫宣稱　強化對德經濟戰　決嚴格限制中立國貿易　申明願維持巴爾幹和平</h3>
<p>倫敦　英相張伯倫昨夜在下院討論英國對中立國以貨物接濟德國之態度、及巴爾幹半島之局勢、當其言及貨物裝船運入德國一事時、曾發「吾人欲採行相當計畫」一語、含　加緊經濟封鎖之意、張伯倫又駁斥德國所發指協約國蓄意擾亂巴爾幹半島和平之宣傳、張伯倫之言曰、德國或已設法欲用前所不用之路綫、增多來自中立國方面之接濟、吾人對此可能性已予以注意吾人已檢討一般局勢而擬採行相當計畫、關於此點、余可為下院議員告者、英政府近已在遠東領海截留有裝運違禁品前往海參崴轉運德國的嫌疑之蘇聯船隻、吾人所締結之戰時商約、皆載有限制中立國以其國內出品運往德國之條文、試舉一例言之、此項條文載有凡德國戰爭努力所必要的油脂、須嚴行限制其對德輸出之規定、此外吾人採購辦法、亦為吾人武庫中之利器、吾人固不能將德國隣邦所可輸出之剩餘盡量採購、但吾人對於若干種選定貨物、如礦油與油脂等積極增購、現使此種貨物之對德供給大為减少、如吾人今已議定辦法、將挪威本季所有剩餘之鯨魚油可供出口者、全部收買一事即其一也、余雖未便縷述其詳、惟余可言者、協約國在東南歐採辦礦物事、規模固甚大也、英國對德國鄰邦之貿易確有甚大發展至可能、余期望貿易交換之加強、而使雙方互獲其惠、同時有關係國必須諒解、彼　茍不準備予吾人以限制其此後對德貿易之擔保、則吾人不能依尤彼等獲有來自英帝國方面之出品也、東南歐之可能的發展、吾人近已時有所聞、德國宣傳甚至謂協約國目的在擾亂巴爾幹半島諸國之和平、其實不然、吾人已與土國作甚有效力之貢獻、以維持東南歐之和平與安全、為研究政治上與經濟上許多緊急問題起見、英政府業已決定召令駐巴爾幹諸國之公使返英商討、而駐義英大使亦將於此時短期告假前來倫敦、余料下院必歡迎此舉、吾人希望駐巴爾幹各國英使在倫敦之商討、當可對於協約國之主義與巴爾幹和平安全之維持、發生良好結果云、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國外交策動　歐局入新階段　英分別與中立諸國　訂立戰時貿易協定</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間權威方面今日謂、英國已與四中立國訂立戰時貿易新協定、且另有較重要之四種協定亦已擬就、據高級人員之報告、協定中含有重要條文、依據此等條文、各中立國尤不以商品與原料再運出口而輸至德國、按英法在歐洲策動之外交戰、為努力使德受困於飢餓、並於斯堪的那維亞巴　幹以及丹麥比利時等處、填　其對德封鎖綫之漏洞、故上述協定之訂立、表示歐洲外交戰已入新階段、聞英法之努力、尤集中於巴爾幹諸國云、又　謂此等協定之中、其與丹麥荷　訂立者、業已簽署第一字母、其條文規定丹荷二中立國可輸入足敷本國正常　要之貨物、不受任何阻礙、但不得以其所輸入之原料、製成商品後再行出口輸至德國，其與希臘西班牙訂立者亦已完成、此外並聞英南二國之商務談判、已於昨日在此間舉行、英羅二國數日內亦將有相仿之會商、至於協定中強迫中立國自願不向德再行輸出之條款、乃出自英國單方面之意見、故各中立國。不致根據該條、採取嚴峻之封鎖手段、如上次大戰美國於一九一八年加入時之所為、據英國之發言人謂、協約國雖覺有加緊封鎖之必要、但一九一八年之計口按日授糧制、政府認為乃最後之手段、該發言人又謂「蘇聯之供給德國」、不足為慮、蘇聯自給不暇、况德國乎（國際社特派員聶克森三日電）</p>
<p>倫敦　張伯倫昨在下院宣稱、英國與丹麥自去歲十一月即開始進行商務談判、迄至昨日已簽訂商務協定、按之此次協定、丹麥以農產物及牛酪等輸入英國、而英國則以煤斤輸往丹麥云、（單日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>中立各國　感覺不安　深懼德施行報復</h3>
<p>阿姆斯特丹　此間政界接讀張伯倫演詞後、不無惶慮、仍以為英國未完全明瞭中立國之地位、蓋對英給予限制對德貿易之擔保一層、乃非中立之行動、勢將使荷蘭受德國方面報復行動之危險也（三日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　此間政界認英相張伯倫之言論、表示協約國將於其認為事宜時、視中立國權利為不復存在、（三日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　關於英首相張伯倫昨日在下院所發表之演說、德國政界人士頃加以評論中稱、該項申明證明兩點、（一）英法決定隨時侵犯其他國家之中立、因張伯倫宣稱英國兵艦將來準備再斯堪的那維亞各國領海之內襲擊德國商船、（二）英法準備摧毀歐洲整個之經濟機構云、（三日通電）</p>
<h3>土國決履行　條約義務　不准交戰國艦　通過韃靼海峽</h3>
<p>土耳其京城　伊諾努總統本日延見英大使許閣森、會談一小時半、薩拉茄格魯外長時亦在座、（三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>安加拉　此間報紙所載之主要新聞、為協約國要求土國准許軍艦通向韃靼尼爾海峽之消息、惟此項消息、旋由倫敦正式予以否認、據本國負責方面云、土國決不違反其諾言、定將恪遵蒙特婁條約、而不許交戰國軍艦於土國守中立時通過此海峽云、（三日路透電）</p>
<h3>瑞典重申　嚴守中立　決傾全國力量　維護獨立權利</h3>

<h3>莫洛托夫　演詞全文　（續完）</h3>
<p>總之蘇聯與立拉愛三四之公約、正忠實的加以實施、三國關係全途發展、實不可限量、</p>
<p>最近外報對於蘇聯及其南部邊境鄰邦之關係、表示極度之關切、特別為高加索邊境與羅馬尼亞方面、吾國政府對於吾人與南部鄰邦之關係、亦覺其並無惡化之理由、此乃無需聲述者、英法兩國、正在敘利亞及近東各地、組織殖民地軍隊、由偉甘特將軍統率、作大規模之可疑活動、此乃事實之事、吾人對於利用此　殖民地或非殖民地之軍隊、作仇蘇行動之企圖、必須機警應付、任何此種企圖、均將引起吾人對抗侵略者之行動、仇視蘇聯之國家或將成為對蘇侵略工具之鄰邦、當已明若觀火矣、至於吾國與土耳其及伊蘭之關係、可由雙方之互不侵犯條約及蘇聯遵守雙方義務之決心決定之、吾國興伊蘭在經濟方面之關係、可由不久以前簽訂之蘇伊商約調整之、余所提及之南部鄰邦中、羅馬尼亞與否人並元互不侵犯條約存在、此乃因兩國之間、尚未解決之糾風存在之故、蘇聯從未承認羅馬尼亞之佔據白沙拉比亞、唯亦從未提出以軍事力量收復白沙拉比亞之問題、是以蘇羅國交亦無惡化之理由、吾國雖久已撤回駐羅公使、而由參贊代理其職務、唯此乃最近過去之特殊環境所造成者、</p>
<p>關於此點、吾人應憶及羅馬尼亞當局一九三八年時對付前蘇聯駐羅代理公使布登哥之行為、查布氏在羅　突告失踪、迄今全無音信、但羅當局則否認與此事有關、</p>
<p>毫無疑問、此種事實、絕不應在開化及有秩序之國家發生、此後蘇聯遲未遺派新公使至羅馬尼亞之理由、已無說明之必要、吾人認為羅當局已認識蘇聯當局决不容忍此種行為之決心、蘇聯政府現已採取步驟將通達蘇聯之地方及卡萊里亞土峽原來區域連繋一氣、業已築成之彼得羅柴夫特斯克蘇裔維鐵路已將卡萊里亞之首都及茂曼斯克鐵路與蘇泰樊拉樊堡綫接通又甘德拉克沙顧魯喬維綫現正在趕築中、不久即可竣事、該綫所將卡萊里亞並本部接連通達蘇聯之顧魯喬維一帶地方、在併入卡萊里亞領土內之工業、除一部份外、均由卡萊里亞芬蘭蘇維埃社會主義共和邦處理、</p>
<p>此次卡萊里亞共和邦是為聯邦之一後、其名稱頗有加以討論之必要、查通全卡萊里亞之區域、並非完全屬於卡萊里亞、一部份係純粹芬蘭領土、芬蘭與卡萊里亞人民在種屬及血統方面、均有密切之關係、此次將卡萊里亞自治共和邦易為卡萊里亞芬蘭共和聯邦必可使該兩民族之經濟及文化獲得進一步之發展、而使彼等之友誼益為增强、同時彼等數年來之積仇亦因此而消弭、蘇聯人民委員會頃授權本人、起草關於卡萊里亞易名之法規、呈交最高蘇維埃審查、</p>
<p>此新共和聯邦行將參加蘇聯之其他共和聯邦、此事在蘇聯各聯邦之團結上、為一重大之新發展、在此帝國主義奴役民眾之時期、帝國主義之戰爭已使民族及殖民地之壓迫尖銳化、小國之權益已成為帝國主義者手中之零錢、吾人之新共和聯邦在此時期成立、足以强調蘇維埃制度保證小國充分發展之利益、</p>
<p>余深信卡萊里亞芬蘭共和聯邦不僅將成為蘇聯西北邊境和平及安全之障屏、且成為共和聯邦中最進步之一頁」（三十一日塔斯電）</p>
<h3>巴爾幹局勢　各國角逐正烈　軍事胥視政治為轉移</h3>
<p>巴爾幹協商各國（土耳其，希臘，羅馬尼亞，南斯拉夫，）近在南斯拉夫京城舉行會議，各國名記者前去採訪消息的，共有二百人，可知其意義的重要。這次會議決議的是什麽，雖要待事實為之證明，但有些軍事上的基本問題，現在很可加以研究，此在今後巴爾幹半島時局的演進，不無裨益。</p>
<p>保加利亞和匈牙利並不是巴爾幹協商國，它們都抱着收復失地政策，尤以對羅馬尼亞為甚。它們都已由德國一手經營，重新武裝起來了。蘇聯在保加利亞的勢力也很强，義大利的外交，在保匈兩國都很活躍。但是，該兩國對南斯拉夫却無眞正重大的爭執，匈牙利在地勢上足以掩護羅馬尼亞，使德國不能南下。保加利亞則可阻止英法和土耳其從陸地援助羅馬尼亞。囚之，保加利亞和匈牙利，在他巴爾幹半島的危局中，都佔有舉足重輕的地位。</p>
<p>其次，義大利的態度也須顧及。該國添造的戰艦四艘，也許今春可告完成，屆時，該國海軍將成為較前更重要的原素，地中海，關係各國有何決策時，或須權衡輕重。這種海軍跨於英法與近東軍隊及英法的盟國（土耳其和埃及）交通綫，至少可使英法不能高枕而臥。義國此種海軍對於該國的政策和討價還價的力量，大有臂助。義國的政策，可認為確實反對蘇聯擴張勢力到巴爾幹區域，但並非即為反對德國。</p>
<p>義大利在南斯拉夫境內的勢力特別强大，該國的海岸綫旣在義國艦隊控制之下，就是在陸地上也有兩面和義國接壤，不過這兩處邊疆，山脈連綿，不易通過而已。義大利，南某件拉夫，匈牙利三國有共同的軍事「諒解」，外面也有傅聞。</p>
<p>南斯拉夫的軍隊，訓練有素，指揮幹練，可稱一種勁旅，不過現代配備不足。該國地勢險阻，遠較波蘭和羅馬尼亞為甚。德國若欲向之進攻，不是容易的事。從另一方面說，南斯拉夫若未得迅速援助的保證，也不敢貿然進攻德國。南斯拉夫的輿情，雖則贊成援助英法兩國，但有其他許多問題也須顧及。</p>
<p>巴爾幹各國之中，羅馬尼亞處境最為危險。德國如果假道匈牙利，或者會同該國及蘇聯，向之進攻，羅馬尼亞或能暫加抵抗，但除非得到外援，長期抵抗恐無希望。</p>
<p>土耳其和英法三國的援助，可從陸地經過保加利亞，或從海道及空中到達羅馬尼亞。土耳其或許會對保加利亞施用充量的壓力，使之聽任這種援助過境，屆時德國旣難立　為保加利亞聲援，而保加利亞的陸軍也無力和土耳其一戰。至於蘇聯對於保加利亞的援助，必須經過羅馬尼亞，道又是費時而不穩常的事，若取海道，則因土耳其的艦隊稍得英法海軍的增援，便可加以截斷。蘇聯黑海艦隊的戰鬥力也許不及土耳其艦隊，旣不能保障蘇聯援軍在海上行動的安全，也不能防阻英法和土耳其取道海上援助羅馬尼亞。中是在英法和土耳其方面也有困難，各該國雖有充分的輸艦，但羅馬尼亞援軍登岸，很費間，在空襲之下，更為費時。</p>
<p>時間的因素在巴爾幹局勢演化中很為重要，德國如何行動，也許視此為轉移。因為德國對於巴爾幹半島的任何軍事冒險行動，茍無迅速獲勝的把握，是不會輕易嘗試的。以二三十師兵力，迅速併呑羅馬尼亞是一件事，與英法近東軍所援助的土羅兩國聯軍作長期的殊死戰，是另一件事。假使德國不顧一切，在巴爾幹方面作長期戰，它的實力必因而大耗，致减弱其西綫的地位。德國在波蘭方面，旣曾竭力避免　種持久戰，茲未必敢在更困難的情况下，在羅馬尼亞方面陷入類似的漩渦。但有一事可注意，蘇聯旣對波蘭用兵，而使波蘭戰爭提早結束，何嘗不可對羅馬尼亞採取同樣行動。</p>
<p>德蘇聯合進攻羅馬尼亞，有種種機會可在土耳其與英法能派大軍開到羅國之前，便在多腦河一帶獲得堅强的據點。不過這種企圖必將引起義國積極的仇視。由此看來，巴爾幹半島的局勢還是混沌不安，胥視種種力量和利害關係如何　制拉攏為轉移，其間軍事的因素，更須視政治上如何調整而定。（譯紐約Herald　Tribune）</p>

<h3>金融　歐戰有轉劇之訉　引起少數外匯買戶</h3>
<p>外　滙昨日巿况、滙豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗巿、近日來平靖異常、祗投機者之小動作、或時使滙價微微波動、故本日情况、亦如是而已、初因滙兌再長二分、開後美滙又鬆〇六二五、為六元一二五、英金則未更、嗣投機家多頭出售、而輞戶稀少、勢遂告鬆期貨一致告硬、一度本月六元美滙、亦難脫手、頃間有利銀行忽入巿、猛吸（傅代某方）、且巿上突傅歐洲戰事轉劇、滙兌有復跌模樣、致賣戶裏足不前、反激起一般經營者稍購、於是為狀轉定、及至午刻、美行供意已漸淡薄、期貨價即由定回平、收盤結果與開盤價相同、（合美英滙兌三元五角六分三七五）、較上日美滙略硬〇六二五、英金仍不分榮辱、期貨潛勢與現貨稍有差別、</p>
<p>開盤多方拋售</p>
<p>晨　初以倫敦大條、近期跌一八七五、遠期降二五、紐約銀價仍平倫敦金呆定、滙兌英對美·滬·法等各滙俱平、美對英續長一分、對滬未更、對法大一分二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辨士一二五、美滙六元一二五、較之前收、英平美硬〇六二五、乃滙兌上漲之故、同時期貨開出、亦告英平美鬆〇六二五、開後投機商前來吐出期貨、微告鬆硬、計賣予有利本月份美滙六元、及五月份美滙五元八四三七五、斯時外行互做本月份英金四辨士〇六二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉小一分、此後靜中仍告鬆態、本月期　滙六元尚難找買戶、但不久外行有利乘機復來吸納、計吃進某行本月份美滙六元、且其時突傅歐洲戰事加劇、滙兌看小、故賣者頓見减少、而反引起少數買戶、計投機商扒入外行五月份美滙五元八一二五、及錢兌業購入華義某行本月份美滙兌業購入華義某行本月份美滙六元、並有利扒進美行現貨美滙六元一二五、午刻美行賣意漸淡、期貨逐形回平、迨至收盤、英金四辨士一二五、美滙六元一二五、本月份英金四辨士〇三一二五、美滙五元九六八七五、五月份英金三辨士九二一八七五、美滙五元八一二五、現期均與晨開相同、結果比上日現期英平美各硬〇六二五、午後週三無巿、</p>
<p>香港美滙轉鬆</p>
<p>香　港三日（週三）電、今晨滙巿開盤告平、英滙無變動、美滙現貨鬆一八七五、為二十二元〇六二五、遠期未開出、申滙現貨降一無為三百五十九元、日滙現貨亦長一元、為九十三元五角、十一時三十分告平、各匯槪無變動、十一時四十七分平穩、申滙現貨升五角、為一百五十九元五角、下午週三無巿、</p>
<p>天津英滙不動</p>
<p>天　津三日（週三）電、今晨滙巿開盤告硬、英匯現貨及申滙均站原盤、美滙現貨鬆〇六二五、為五元八一二五、「聯鈔」暗盤回昂一元、為一百〇一元二角五分、</p>
<h3>金巿開盤　人氣甚餒　不久又復回上</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤巿况、雖環境影響　疲落、但人心依然堅挺、結果僅小二十七元、初開首因匯兌放長、美匯報鬆、即猛撳六十元、不少賣戶、注意力集中、似有所待、繼聞滙巿期貨一致微硬、求售愈多、致再小十元、但金號錢兌業等突搜購殊力、一拉即達五千四百八十元、惟銀號及證券帮均不時塞出、復跌至五千四百四十五元、午刻外匯期貨回平、巿象亦為之一振、故其時購者踴躍、步步上升、最高曾到五千四百九十二元、結果亦為五千四百八十三元、午後週三停巿、塲外未聞做開、半天交易約二千兩以上、銀樓飾金先跌後回、海關金呆定、</p>
<p>烚赤續跌廿七元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩、）初開匯兌報長二分、美斯匯帶硬、塲中人氣甚餒、一片喊賣聲、開巿即撳小六十元、證券帮出銀號二十兩、為五千四百五十元、少頃錢兌業吐出、且斯時外匯期貨微鬆再做低十元、金號賣予錢兌業三十兩、為五千四百四十元、嗣有現金號乘低買入、銀樓帮亦稍拖進、再加某金號猛進、而賣者一時寂然、遂回起四十元、錢兌業互做五十兩、為五千四百八十元、旋乃某證券帮多頭脫手、且某錢兌業賣意亦濃、散戶跟寒者亦佔多數、復又步跌三十五元、證券帮出金號五十兩為五千四百四十五元、此後金號復來搜入、巿勢轉穩、回上十餘元、迨十一時後、再有某錢兌業及銀號等競吸、而斯時外滙期貨已報回平、遂繼續漲起三十餘元、銀號進金號三十兩、為五千四百九十二元、後銀號復吐重又降落九元、銀號互做十兩、為五千四百八十三元、作午收價、結果比上日續跌二十七元、半天五十二元十落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高數元、收進减低二十元、現標金照掛牌低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金先小後回平</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百五十五元、迨至九點半、掛小五元、十一時五十分、回高五元、此後無變化、結果大同行依然懸五百五十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>美金票動盪不定</h3>
<p>昨日外瞥巿况、英美金鎊供塞未减、巿價賡續趨下、英金票供求尚衡、巿價站穩、美金票猶激盪不定、終仍趨下、晨即退至十六元三角一分、開後賣氣益盛、一霎時更落至十六元二角三分、跌後引起一般購吸、嗣又步高至十六元三角四五分、午後復趨低落、卒為十六元三角、香港票隨港滬匯兌趨漲、安南票仍有需要、巿價續漲、斐律濱票趨勢仍軟、日金票各方需要激增、漲風未載、晚巿為一元三角二分五厘、朝鮮票跟隨步漲、晚巿為一元零四分五厘、昨日巿價、計英美金鎊各跌五角、美金票降七分、香港票大五厘、安南票漲三分、斐律濱票小五分、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3>貼現回小四元</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、反動回落、每千元上午初做六十九元、一度做升至七十一元、但不久即回下至六十六元、下午無變動、仍為六十六元、比前日回小四元、錢業公會拆息、晨午兩巿均掛二角云、</p>
<h3>證券　目標移轉　活動公債</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日巿况漲勢仍頗緊俏、巿上不乏補空交易、人心亦大都看好、微聞金融界頗有吸收、此時行有餘力、亦意中事、且公債倲用匯劃票據與銀根鬆緊並無多大關係、故丙種頗有人預料或將穿出五十元關、昨日買戶以德孚為最踴躍、餘如天生鴻大聯和生大以及茂泰恒孚胡鶴記等均有相當收進、賣方以樂茂為多、同康泰豐庚興以及散戶等均有拋售、行巿在求過於供下、復漲一二角至四角不等、成交總　約有一百三十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>統戊四九·七〇　四九·三五　四九·六〇又·三五</p>
<p>股　票交易、成交中一信託股五十股、價為十元正、眾業公所　股巿因前日賣方殘餘壓力尚存、開盤趨勢未堅、後因低價不易獲得想望之股、買方出價頻增、收盤各股需求良好、巿况回堅多、一洗疲軟風氣、上海銀公司會德豐公共汽車及怡和等股尤有起色、</p>
<p>中國懇植股因公司頃所宣布之上屆末期股良祗六角、未免令人失望、開盤價格下遊、一度曾見十四元低價、但後有人深覺是項股息（連前合計一元二角）名為全年利息、實祗經半年工作後之營業利得（蓋該公司之礦在一九三〇年開始數月中幾全耗於機械裝置、而秋間又困於大雨不能工作）、故回風條起、收盤十四元半有買戶、</p>
<p>橡皮股需求較殷、蘭格志特形活潑、因謠傳其將有優良股息發表也、</p>
<p>英商麥邊洋行經理中國墾殖有限公司（即門頭溝煤礦）第二十一次股東常年大會、定於四月二十六日舉行、一九三九年份末次股息、擬續派國幣六角、連中期共派國幣一元二角、</p>

<h3>糧食　米巿稍鬆</h3>
<p>米　巿自暴跌回昂轉呈盤旋後、若一號西貢常徘徊於四十四五元、其間雖有一度高峯曾達四十六元半、然一漲即落、昨巿上囂傅內地若京蕪及常錫蘇加一帶不日均將開放、疏通來滬之訊、致作客不敢貿然從事、浮囤散戶亟謀速脫、頃刻各貨行情貶落近元、其後跌風益熾、迄中巿先後一瀉、已將二元左右、一號西貢祇售四十四元半四十四元、米菉則以巿貨較薄、所跌元許、計開碎米高自三十六元低至三十五元、米菉三十七元半至三十七元、引起乘廉動辦、各價曾稍回昂三五角、但終以人心已餒一動即懈、結果收盤各色洋米價仍較前巿暴跌元至二元不一、糯米巿貨雖夥、然以巿面一跌再跌、價格與碎米將伯仲、已屬底盤、頗有問津、一方售方亦不肯再貶、所以行情獨堪站住、無甚變化、厚薄粳及早晚稻等國米、昨由虹口轉出者頓旺、不下四五千包、而塲外暗盤、聞一般貨主遂謀急脫亦降元外、崑錫粳四十五六元、中四十四元、特薄稻四十四五元、中四十三元、南港早晚稻四十二三元、次至四十一元云云、</p>
<p>大　宗洋米又有運到、係華綸洋行大浦輪、自西貢直接運來、計二萬九千一百五十包、於前日（二日）傍晚六時許抵埠、停靠虹口公和祥碼頭、昨晨起正起卸中、又意輪孟脫披阿那號亦由西貢運來大量洋米、約明日可到、確數容待續報、</p>
<p>洋　米晨間開價即見狂瀉、蓋近日定貨大批到申外又被日商拋出大量粳米、人心更為虛軟、早巿現洋米狂落二元、後巿實銷動辦、始見回好三四角、然人心依然虛軟、期貨跌風亦猛、四月份一號西貢五十二元、二號四十九元半、即交降至四十九元尚乏進戶、　還四月份四十八元六角、即交四十八元二角、又小絞小至四十八元半、四月份小至四十九元、比之前日高價跌落一元半至一元不等、統巿期貨開三百七十五噸、現米四千五百包、</p>
<p>另　訊、日前本報所誌「大昌公司」之組織、頃據記者探悉、業已正式成立、主持人為郁某、參加者大都為資力雄厚之糧商、查以偌大之資本來經營糧食、尚屬創舉、嗣後頗有操持本巿民食之可能、又據米業領袖符某云、目下租界當局與社業所商討之產銷合作問題、與此事無關、蓋前者為私、後者則為謀租界居民大眾之福利也、（餘）</p>
<h3>麵粉交易微動　小麥依然呆滯</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日交易、較前微活、除本街及內地鄉帮略有點綴外、客帮亦稍有染指、惟巿面則反見鬆濫、蓋由於米價回跌一二元、且目下日廠雜牌粉在巿傾銷、頗受影響、聞老車牌回籠貨晨初喊價與廠盤相埒、上午一度擯持、迨後巿僅開十三元七角二分、比前日回鬆數分、惟綠砲車客盤仍須十五元、天竹牌亦須十四元、由鹿牌十三元、全日間成交約計四五千包、本街零銷由廠家批出者約有七八千包、查麵今（四日）有六千包、運往天津、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日交易殊屬有限、巿面仍不脫呆定之局、邇來華廠方面、因洋麥雖有運到、亦需本麥搭配、故進胃尚不寂寞、惟終不肯放價收買、而執貨者亦始終不願鬆讓、結果由福新廠等辦去常錫麥一鎖千包、價仍為二十三元五角、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆尚少進展</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆巿况、實銷尚少發展、故大局迂緩不前、昨高豆擯持未開上中關貨由榨油廠及囤胃等拖進、下身貨本街間有問津、共計做開南京豆一百十餘包、價為十八元五角、蕪湖豆六百餘包、價自二十元至二十一元二角、蚌埠豆五車、價為二十二元七角二十二元五角、揚州山黃一車、價為十九元、丁家州豆百餘包、價為二十二元、及大連夾青豆一百包、價為二十元零五角云、</p>
<h3>紗花　西南辨紗　繼續不懈</h3>
<p>紗　巿先跌後回、結果與上日無軒輊、然人心依然熱烈、因西南方面對於華紗仍屬繼續不懈、故多頭對於二十支雙馬紗盡量吸收、所以巿價一鬆即漲、惟匯巿已見放長、海外棉巿疲憊、印棉跌風日熾、換算價廉宜、就日前廠方營業順利、購進遠期印棉、開出期紗而論、當有巨利可得矣、</p>
<p>現　紗晨開、聞英美匯兌續漲、印棉大跌、人心尚平、二十支雙馬四月份價為一千一百二十五元、旋以黃金下落、美匯軟弱、賣氣稍盛、直跌至一千一百十五元、但低價一見、多頭復來活動、巿盤徐徐回升、漲至一千一百四十五元收盤、以後略形回挫、查半日間成交統計二千六百十包、行情二十支雙馬現貨跌　元、廠方由申新開出二十支雙馬一千五百包、價為一千〇五十元至一千〇六十五元、卅二支雙馬一百五十包、價一千四百五十五元、均係粵帮買去、四日運天津一百十五件、運烟臺一百四十五件、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、九〇〇　香港六五五內地五五　統計二、六一〇</p>
<h3>印棉跌勢加厲　本棉交易仍清</h3>
<p>本　棉交易、依然寥寥、惟外棉同行稍有互　買賣、但巿消甚為軟弱、因外棉趨勢續趨下風、而印棉跌風俞熾、換算價殊廉也、蘇北來源到通花五百餘包、茲將現棉成交情形如左、</p>
<p>米特林　二七二·〇〇　同行進一〇〇件</p>
<p>又　二七五·五〇　又　二〇〇件</p>
<p>奧姆拉　二〇七·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>

<p>北太　二〇五·〇〇　又　三〇〇包</p>
<p>魯米特林二七〇·〇〇　又　一〇〇件</p>
<p>另　訊、外棉巿價、紐約棉巿昨晨又趨沉悶、先因利物浦來電告跌、及孟買來電又跌、因之人心異常虛弱、加之一部份多頭在巿了結、結果收盤價格較之上日降落六七磅音、印度連同高效能又跌七羅比、埃及停巿、</p>
<p>滬　滬外棉交易、因印度棉巿之續跌、雖紗價之德續高翔、人心頗為虛弱、同業間前訂之印棉、至今俱成高價、加之昨日匯兌、略見鬆長、各方均急欲脫售、然廠方購意仍淡、茲將昨日棉巿以美滙六元一二五、折合送廠價列左、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　二八三·二五</p>
<p>二十支　又　下級二七一·〇〇</p>

<h3>絲茶　紐約絲價大跌</h3>
<p>昨國外絲巿紐約入跌、（橫濱節假停業）、紐約近期跌一角九分、遠期跌二角二分、前日本埠發出電報、昨乃一無回音、蓋紐約新人造絲織品、已將出現巿上、而維新自尚之美國民眾、在對眞絲之感情上、堂將减少、故在最近間之絲價或將繼續軟弱狀態云、</p>
<h3>糖巿　粗白小挫</h3>
<p>昨糖巿據荷蘭產電又小一角、粗白價照C．I．K．G．例為荷盾八·六五、故本巿公盤趨勢見疲、現貨二四粗白本棧貨六十二元半、小五角、外棧新到六十二元一角至二元、小八角、老貨六十一元八角、小六角、轉口貨四十八元四角、亦降六角、太古車白上檔小二三角、B嘜西綫六十八元八角、CW嘜六十八元三角、CX嘜六十七元八角DY嘜六十七元二角、HX嘜六十七元、東棧照退、H嘜軍赤新貨四十九元、老貨四十八元、油包四十七元、荷赤WA嘜五十二元、轉口四十四元、本冰一號七十四元半、二號七十四元、晶明冰七十六元、雪白六十二元、均小五角、國糖僅廣帮開出懸州洋八十二包、五十六元條青七十箱、三十九元、</p>

<h3>工部局董事競選　英美陣綫極鞏固　日虛聲恫嚇必於事無補　未納清捐稅者不得投票　大陸報促外僑選民一致奮起</h3>
<p>自日方向工部局要求增加日籍董事名額以後、工部局以地皮章程不能變更、迄未應尤、乃日方竟逕自提出日籍候選人、增至五名之多、其意蓋欲强行打破英五·美二·日二之「君子協定」、而與英籍董事同其名額、籍此統制租界行政、英美納稅人為抵制日方意圖起見、除與其他歐美僑民中之選舉人、採取聯合戰綫、使英美籍當選者所獲票數、多於日籍當選者所獲票數外、並將英籍候選人增加一名、連日英美日各方面、對競選活動甚力、日方叫囂萬狀、竟謂英方增加候選人一名、為桃戰行為、可謂英日兩方利害衝突最烈、日半官方面機關報大陸新報、昨日社評、竟對公共租界發恫嚇之詞、謂如此次競選不達目的、則日軍有採取可能范圍之行動、又云、凡各團體阻止日人此種進展者、應準備對此後結果負完全之責任、可謂無所不用其極、故事態之嚴重與緊張、可相而知、茲分誌昨日發展情形於后、</p>
<p>日對猶人威脅利誘</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局董事競選、即將舉行、日方遊說者今以「准許猶太移民之親戚入滬」為餌、引誘蘇州河北岸之歐洲猶人選舉日籍候選人五名、日方已在兆豐路設立競選運動辦事處、內有日人兩名、由德國出亡來滬之猶太人四名、襄助工作、傾其全力以獲取少數民族之選舉權、俾使工部局日董增至五名、」</p>
<p>英美僑民不選日人</p>
<p>惟眾信德籍猶太人之有選舉權者、多居蘇州河南岸、不受日方壓力之引誘、而上海有選舉權之德僑、僅半數為國社黨員、查往年有選舉權之英美僑民、大多選舉英美及日籍候選人、惟本年英僑民朱必復選日人、而將選舉英籍候選人五名與額外候選人麥唐納、曁美籍候選人二名、因此甚至有將日董减至一人之可能、</p>
<p>付清捐稅始能選舉</p>
<p>至於投票時間、則為十日與十一日上午十時至下午三時、在萬國商團操練廳及虹口小菜塲按向例舉行、目下英美日僑民間均甚活動、爭取少數民族之選舉權、並查問本國籍納稅人已否付淸捐稅、蓋納稅人未納淸捐稅、即不能獲得赴投票處所必需之投票證也、聞開啟票箱、檢點票數之監票人可隨意得若干人助手、協約檢點、蓋選舉票並非工部局官員檢點數目也、</p>
<p>日方態度甚為強橫</p>
<p>日半官方機關報大陸新報、昨日社評竟對公共租界發為恫嚇云云、「此次日方若不能在工部局中獲得較多之代表地位、則日軍自採取可能範圍以內之行動、以獲得公共租界之管理權、如日人此種「合理」之要求、不幸而為西僑所蔑視、而英人對租界之「獨裁」狀况、仍將繼續時、則日方將放棄其「合法程序」而代以他道、如此後狀態果如上述、則租界內形况、將重入混亂狀態中矣」、該報又警告各團體云、「凡阻止日人此種進展者、應準備對此後結果負完全之責任」、該報復稱、「當去年公共租界問題提出討論時、曾有人指責公共租界為「反日運動」之策源地、而建議日人對租界應以武力解決、使之成為日軍管轄下之一部份、但據吾等所知、租界問題之結果、業已有「合法」之解決、蓋越界築路警務協定及虹口區之協定、業已由雙方簽訂也、」</p>
<p>目前情勢無從估計</p>
<p>據外人方面觀察、此次日人突然宣布候選人增至五人之多、實將使公共租界七十年以來從未變更之基礎、為之動搖、而在最近十年中、公共租界工部局西董席次五二二之比例、將首次發生搖動、此次日方果達目的、則英美僅得其餘之四席、相形之下、英僑勢力雖較美僑為强、但目今對分配情形、則一般人固無從作若伺預測也、</p>
<p>德俄僑民舉足重輕</p>
<p>此次競選中、其最關重要之外人團體、厥為在滬之德僑與俄僑、德僑納稅人約共七百、包括德人及德籍猶太難民、而德籍猶太難民、大半均居於日人所統制之蘇州河北區、不論德人是否完全擁護英美僑候選人、但就估計、至少有猶太難民四白人之譜、投票贊成日僑候選人、如上所述、則本埠四百五十名俄籍納稅人、其居於橋南者或居於橋北者、其態度可知矣、此外、尚有居住於公共租界之德人一百名、葡人一百名、彼等或可贊助英美方面、但議僑九十名、西班牙僑民十二人、則恐因所謂反共協定」關係、而擁護日人、荷人二十四名、及其他各國僑民約三百人、或可擁護英美方面、由上雙方所能獰得之票數估計、如所有投票人能維持百分之八十五之票數發生效力、（德人及俄人除外）英美方面、始可與日人獲得相等票數、昨日據可靠方面宣稱日人在舉行選舉前、決對爭取票數一事加緊抗幟、但渠以為如日人確已如是、則橋北區日僑須首先繳付所應納之捐稅、</p>
<p>英候選人聲明態度</p>
<p>英僑獨立候選人上海名律師雷諾麥唐氏、昨日對西報記者發表談話、略謂、「余為英僑候選人、但並非五人中之一、余係一「超人」、但在此次選舉中、余果當選、則余極願自稱為「上海人」、余之所以自命為「超然」者、因余並非屬于某一方面、或某一集團、故余不願為任何一方面或一團體之「公僕」、余願為整個上海社會効力、且願以百折不回之精神、以爭取整個市民不論其疏于任何國籍者之幸福余為一民主主義者、而深信在上海應有民主政體式之管理機關、余願代表一完全為「民治·民有·民享·」之政府、余願使工部局之事務完全公開、一洗積習、而使市民對工部局各種制度、無一陰暗之處、余願現狀完全改變、尤其對不平等之地產規則、應予改善、余果當選、余將為最可能之經濟節約方法而奮鬥、直至公共租界之經濟狀况、獲得健全之基礎而後已、父訊、又日僑候選人對工部局增加市政損百分之五十之擬議、早已表示堅決之反對、此事之解決、殆將士本月十七日召開之納稅西人年會中決定、但日方對於具體辦法、迄今尙無若何表示、</p>
<h3>外僑一致團結</h3>
<p>本屆選舉關係綦鉅</p>
<p>大陸報昨刋題名一公共秬界之地位」社評云、日僑選舉委員會提出候選人五名、參加工部局董事競選一舉、已使本年度之競選問題具體化、本月十日與十一日選舉時所將決定之唯一問題、厥為公共租界之政治地位與國際性質、將吾在此時更變</p>
<p>不斷挑　靡有已時</p>
<p>溯自一九三七年八月以還、日人即向公共租界施加種種壓力、用其武力威脅租界之中立與安全、不斷利用壓迫外交陰損公共租界之主權及國際性、並得不法行動之鼓勵、一再向工部局統治其轄區之能力挑　、此次競選中、乃其最近之挑釁、須由公共租界納稅人單獨迎戰而擊敗之、</p>
<p>競選運動自身努力</p>
<p>日方目下之競選運動、與日人已往謀控制公共租界之企圖逈異、不能由第三國之外交行動在旁協助以阻之、故公共租界納稅人務必不恃外來援助、而在行將舉行之選舉中奮鬥、公共租界與非日人外僑苟敗於日人之選舉挑戰、則非英美政府不願援助工部局之故、亦非大遭營議的工部局屈從政策所致、而許由上海外籍納稅人之昏憒負其全責、</p>
<p>英美政府無可相助</p>
<p>往時本市居民對外搏鬥時、恒過份依恃於在公共租界有利益的第三國之行動、當日人謀以威脅外交壓力及武力控制公共租界時、納稅人泰然處之、希望華盛頓與倫敦方面之行動、相信英美政府決當救上海出於水火、惟此次局勢迪異、英美雖願保護公共租界　亦不能相助轉移本月十日與十一日之投票決定、非日人外僑苟有棄權或內江致未能投足額選舉票以擊敗日人、則上海日人依法有權統制公共租界、工部局董事亦將　日人集團</p>
<p>日人言論極堪注意</p>
<p>日僑選舉委員會主席林雄吉所宣布之選舉政綱、値得本市納稅人加以注意、林氏之言有「日人目的、端在消除任何特殊僑民團體獨斷市政事務、庶公共租界之行政、得在眞正的國際狀態中進行之」等語、此種選舉政綱、以外交詞令出之、其眞意一閱即知、即日人志在消除目下之獨斷制、而代以日人之獨斷制、及改變目下之國際成為純粹的日入行政機構是也、</p>
<p>外僑選民一致奮起</p>
<p>從上海前途炎觀點而言、本月十日與十一日競選之重要性、殆未能過於誇張、公共租界　吾成為東京市郊之問題將視選舉結果而定、本市外僑將否仍由本人管理、抑由日人市政當局統治之問題、將　非日人外僑之投票能力而定、如　文所述、此等問題、非　決於華盛頓或倫敦、而取決　公共租界之投栗人、蓋維持公共租界之國際地位、及上海之日本化、其間區別、唯投票人之將吾投票是賴也、</p>

<p>僞「中央市塲」及滬西白利南路南市兩分「塲」、原定於前日同時開始營業、然因富時擱截所得、不敷分配、故僅「中央市塲」一處開業、現掠取地貨、已逐漸增多、故白利南路分「塲一、已决定於明日開市、至南市分「塲」、開張之圖、已無期延擱、茲將詳情分誌於後、</p>
<p>自知苛刻防范故嚴</p>
<p>僞「中央市場成立後、加緊攔截運滬地貨、致除鄉人秘密運滬者外、市塲上地貨來源、已逐漸稀少、商人遂不得不向該「塲」批購地貨、　用小工至該「塲」戰返、然該「塲」明知剝削平民、故防範之間、備極小心、對批貨菜販、均規定須購領「出入證」後、始能出入、而一般地貨商人、雇用之小工、均無此「證」、懼有意外、乃於昨日通知地貨商人、並在大門前貼出布吿、以後一律嚴禁外間之小工人內、</p>

<p>滬西白利南路僞一中央市塲分塲」、原定與「中央市塲」同日開始營業、然以當時攔截所得地貨不多、若一處同時開始營業、將不數分配、故僅「中央市塲」先行開市、現日僞在四郊加緊攔截後、掠取地貨、已逐漸增加、故白利南路分「塲」巳決定於明日起正式開始營業、至南市分「塲」、則雖數次向法租界當局請求開放十六舖鐵門、均無結果、故開張之圖、已無期延擱矣、</p>

<h3>法租界　昨晚發生綁案　被綁者為台州人葛醴泉　烟兌店老闆中流彈受傷</h3>
<p>昨晚九時四十分、法租界鄭家木橋街發生匪徒綁架一台州商人、當時爲該處崗捕覺察、雙方開槍互轟、結果該商人終被架去、流彈擊傷一烟兌店老闆、詳情錄后、</p>
<p>闢室旅社</p>
<p>台州人葛醴泉、年四十五歲、滬寓法租界呂班路呂班坊三號、宅內附設台帮船商駐滬辦事處」、葛於去年十一月一日忽在鄭家木橋街一百十四號新新祥記旅社二樓闢第二一八號房間、携有一少婦及一靑年男子、據葛稱、少婦即渠之髮妻、靑年乃彼之胞姪、</p>
<p>突來四人</p>
<p>昨晚九時半左右、忽有一形似某國人率同一着中裝兩御西服之華人三名、同乘自備汽車一輛、直抵新新祥記旅社門口、四人一齊下車後、即留一八字鬍鬚面色號黑者守於門口把風、餘三人則一擁而入、直上二樓、闖入二一八號房間、時葛正在房內與妻姪閒談、該三人一見葛在、即有二人袖出手槍、禁止聲張、</p>
<p>將葛架走</p>
<p>當時葛見狀知難抵抗、即被三人曳出房間、待抵二樓扶梯口時、該三人即將葛推跌於樓下、其時葛已暈倒、仆地不起、三人跟踪下樓、會同站立門口把風之人、即將葛抬起、挾入匪徒乘來之汽車內、開足速率、向北穿過公館馬路、一直駛去、</p>
<p>汽車號碼</p>
<p>常時該處適立有一崗捕、初見匪徒所乘汽車上之符號係一白色　圓形、中有號碼第二四七號、心中即起疑寳、蓋該捕深知該種汽車牌號爲某國人所用之軍用汽車、故即加以注意、迨見四人自旅社中共抬一人上車、更知不妙、正欲趕上喝令停車、而汽車已疾馳而去、</p>
<p>開槍互轟</p>
<p>該捕乃尾追車後、一面狂呼、一面拔取　寗興街四　路路口詎汽車內之匪徒、已先行開槍拒捕、該捕遂亦還擊、隻方互轟四五槍、終以時在夜間、該捕一人實力單薄、卒被兎脫、目睹匪車駛向愛多亞路轉瞬無踪、</p>
<p>流彈傷人</p>
<p>同時該管麥蘭捕房亦聞警、派出大批中西探捕趕到、惜匪徒早已遠颶乃返至新新祥記旅社調查一過、當匪徒開槍拒捕時、有寗興街八十四號（即鄭家木橋街四义路西北首之轉角）永豐泰姻兌店之老闆羅店人主寳忠（年五十一歲）正在收拾打烊之際、竟被擊中一流彈、子彈自右鼻旁顴骨射入、並未洞穿、隨送仁濟醫院、聞傷勢尙無大碍、惟聞法捕房當局對本案異常重視、現正嚴密偵查中、</p>

<p>上海一隅，綜東南數省之華麗，而反乎西北數省之儉嗇，未遊其地者，羨者有之，鄙者有之。平日自信持守之嚴，亳無失足，忽作申江之遊，乃其嗜好比久居者為甚，甚矣哉習俗之移人也。近日淺邑之衣，始行於京都，而講求又莫過於梨園，今蜜色竹根青之衣，相屬於道，反置天靑深藍於無用。又如鞋舖之花樣，百款俱備，而惟天津是尚。　之不厭其醜，試於洋塲四圍，徧數行人，着花鞋者十之七八，凡雲頭緞帮或雙梁靴尖，則十之二三，甚而五六十歲之老人，亦如是趨時好異，則翩翩少年，更不待言矣。至於婦女妝束，蘇州最為繁華，而香艷之中，又尚雅淡，妓寮林立，鬥巧爭妍，而大家宅眷，輒復效之，其為蘇松人無論矣，乃杭州寗紹等府之人，挈眷僦居者，亦爭效尤。梳頭凡枕式如盤如龜般，紹式如元寶，寗式如蜻蜓如蟬翼；諸不之尚，使見者莫辨其非蘇人。而近又因妓寮尚挽髻，亦學而梳櫛之，此等妝束，果何所取，而變本加厲乃如是，寗非習之移人乎。習不能除，則性不可復，大而人之終身，小而事之一端，莫不皆然。良民日少，盜賊日多，亦皆自此積漸而成也。夫人各有性，世不能無習，習之害性，如此其義！上知以下，下愚以上，皆可慮也。</p>

<h3>兒童節的話</h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>四月的兒童節又到了，照例又有慶祝委員會產生，也照例要熱烈地慶祝一番；同時，照例又有許多報紙雜誌，刋載批評慶祝兒童節的文章，照例有許多人指出大部份兒童的悲慘的命運。這些都是很好的。</p>
<p>的確，在第九屆兒童節的今日，我們不應該把我們不幸的小同胞遺忘了，尤其是那些在水深火熱中與飢餓綫上掙扎着的小朋友，我們更不應該把他們忘掉。</p>
<p>我們承認在不合理的現社會制度下，要為大多數的兒童謀福利，是難乎其難的。我們要認清，惟有社會制度的合理化，才有使我們的小同胞享受眞福利的可能。所以，在紀念兒童節的今日，我們要緊緊抓住我們最後的目標——促合理社會制度的實現。</p>
<p>在今日，社會制度的改革雖未實現，可是我們還得以各盡本位上的力時，去謀取兒童的福利，來慶祝我們的兒童節。</p>
<p>我們要記住：今日多種一粒好種籽，明天就多開一朶美麗的鮮花。一切都不是徒然的！</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>解放兒童心理的束縛</h3>
<p>— 程炎泉</p>
<p>現代一般兒童精神上最大的痛苦，莫過於大人給他們的壓迫，使他們缺乏內心的自由。中國人有一種傅統的心理，便是一般家庭禁止兒童遊戲。他們的見解是：「白相要把兒童的心玩野了。」所謂詩禮之家，總要牢守着「勤有功，嬉無益」的訓條，要壓迫兒童少年老成，不要去做種種遊戲。但兒童偏要不爭氣，不論貧富貴賤，十中有九是喜歡游戲的。於是大人就要把他們管束，這種態度，在二十世紀的今日，實有改正之必要。依照兒童心理和生理的發展來說，遊戲對兒童實有很大的價値。在身體上遊戲能增進血液循環，發達肌肉，臟腑的運動加速，消化的機能也同時增進。身體的抵抗力因此就大可增加。又因遊戲大部份在戶外及寬廣的地方，所以呼吸的空氣也可較為新鮮。遊戲對於精神上則可以生出愉快與滿足的感情，可以調節精神的疲勞。也可以發抒過剩的精力。一種創造的精神，競勝的精神，都可以在遊戲上訓練出來。遊戲在道德上，也有很大價値，如服從規律的習慣，公正嚴明的態度，忠於團體的義務，以及集體生活的知識坦直地承認自的失敗而努力的美德，都可以由此養成。所以成人對於兒童遊戲，只能有指導，不能有壓迫。可以防止他們的過分劇烈及危險的舉動，而不能根本把他們取消。因為取消了遊戲，也就是取消了兒童的發展。</p>
<p>其次，大人對兒童總是抱着老資格的成見，訓誨兒童的舉動，而不喜歡兒童利用嘗試錯誤去改變行為。這在精神上對於兒童也是一種壓迫，所謂創造的天性，都給大人一齊理沒。其三，一般父母都是抱着「捧打出孝子」的成見，往往過分責罰兒童，使兒童有被壓迫的感覺。這種影響使兒童努力求解脫，有時候兒童在心理上排斥外綠。例如有些兒童因父親脾氣大，使他學會以反抗一切。有的則變得很害羞，不喜羣居，或性慾變態。父母脾氣大或管束嚴的兒童，往往就是脾氣最壞，或是舉動最危險的兒童。其四，許多家庭往往有男女歧視的觀念，這樣，使女孩子的自卑心格外發展，使她長大了，總是猶豫狐疑的。狐疑如果太過，便以為只有男子是有作為的。</p>
<p>其五，是學校和敎師對兒童的壓迫。中國人向來是重視師道的，「敎不嚴，師之惰，」也就是敎師們的信條。敎師對兒童總是敎師們的信條。敎師對兒童總是不顧兒童心理，而硬拉兒童到知識的海中去游泳，這樣，使敎學就難以得到效果。敎師處理問題兒童，多半是用責罰，懲戒，訓誨來處置。但如果不了解兒童，則無論怎樣責罰訓誨，都是沒得用的。</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>靜靜的大華路</h3>
<p>— 周世德</p>
<p>在這裏，我要敘述的是大華路的情形。那是在靜安寺路與愛文義路之間，戈登路之東的一條很短的路。可是，路雖是很短而很平凡的，却有許多不平凡的事在那裏陸續發生。也許，有些人們以為這也是很平凡的。</p>
<p>大華路是一條荒凉的路，在白天，也是很靜的。路面是沙泥和石子。行人道也是沙泥的只有行人道的邊緣是水泥的。路的兩邊儘是堆棧。卡車來時，沙灰颺起丈把高。卡車去後，聲音也沒有了，沙灰也歇息了，一切復歸於平靜。沙泥的行人道是乞丐們的公館，乞丐們白天是不常在公館裏的，因為他們也要生活，他們也要吃一點維持生命的東西。只有天氣晴朗的時候，他們會坐在行人道上晒太陽，有的坐在那裏捉虱子放到嘴裏嚼得格別格別的響。我想他們會想到富翁們吃佳餚美酒時的滋味的吧！有的閉着眼睡在行人道上養神。太陽和暖的照着。可是夜晚到來之後，寒冷和黑暗包圍着他們，他們只有瑟縮在籬笆的下面了。這時，他們沒有這許多空閒來想像富人們吃穿的與的睡的了，唯一的問題是冷。他們的身體縮做一團，他們的心也縮做一團了。</p>
<p>當夜晚到來之後，大華路上也許一個人影都看不見。他們也許是瑟縮在大飯館的牆角邊吧：然而大華路總是靜靜的。除了風聲之外，一點聲音也沒有。只有隔得老遠才有一張的路燈，因風的吹動而顯出淡淡的寒光。</p>
<p>有一晚，我從大華路經過時，忽然看到一個小孩的屍體。在他蒼白的面孔上，看不出一點什麽來，看到的只是靜的表現。他小眼睛緊緊地閉着。此後我就不常走大華路了。然而以後還看見過兩三回，有的用蒲包裹着。有的就穿着他生前穿的衣服，躺在路旁邊。他們的父母太窮了，我想是這個緣故有時反要引起反動，使問題兒童更成問題。改正兒童的正當方法，是要明白他的家庭，明白他晚上的夢境，明白他過去的遭遇，從此了解他的原型，知道他在一切生活情境中發生的不良結果。把自己放到兒童的過去環境裏，設身處地想一下，就會對他個人生出很大的同情。我們要改變原型，不能僅僅用生活的經騐去改變，因為生活的經騐已經是遵照他一己的統覺組織的，我們惟有從根本的人格着手，才能把他改變。例如有許多兒童功課壞，敎師不喜他，他就喜歡吵架，制服別人，認為是一種英雄的行為，但我們一加分析，他與英雄簡直相差太遠，他缺乏社會興趣，過的是無益生活，他沒有勇氣在功課上競爭，這是懦弱的表現。我們要改變他，應該使他澈底明白，自己的犯過是懦弱的表示。</p>
<p>學校規程如果太嚴，兒童規程不應該是依照批評壓迫，與責罰的原則而訂，它必須是注意鍛練的，敎育的，有社會價値的，發展兒童興趣的為原則。學校固不應放任兒童過度活動，但也不宜限制兒童適當的活動，而於懲獎，指導，更宜再三注意。</p>
<p>愛倫凱說：「二十世紀是兒童的世紀。」我希望大家記住這一句話。</p>

<h3>天堂中的地獄</h3>
<p>— 唐愛珍</p>
<p>「孤島」是兒童的天堂，也是兒童的地獄。</p>
<p>兒童節來臨了，瞳　於我們眼前的，是一幅悲喜相對的人生圖畫，襯着孩子們的哭與笑的交響曲；在人類短促的生命路途中進行着。</p>
<p>「天堂」裏的孩子們，是幸運兒，天之嬌子。他們生長在富有的家庭裏，衣，食，住，和敎育……都沒有問題。他們逍遙自在，享受人間所有的快樂。</p>
<p>「地獄」下的孩子們，是不幸的，痛苦的「畜生」！他們生長在貧苦之家，無衣，無食，無住所。更談不到敎育了。他們流亡各地，受盡人世間種種的悽凉苦楚。</p>
<p>在「天使」們快樂地慶祝兒童節的歌聲中，我們不要忘却「孤島」上還有數十萬貧苦流亡的小孩子，在「地獄」裏受盡狂風暴雨的摧殘！</p>
<p>這一羣可憐的遍野「哀鴻」；是等待我們拯救的。幸福的人們，除了自己享受快樂之外，還須為貧苦的兒童着想，盡一己之所能，救濟難童，捐助慈善機關；，像孤兒院，育嬰堂，難民收容所……。更須羣策羣力，多方籌設難音敎養所，使數十佢無家可歸的災童，得有安身和受敎的地方。這不僅是難童的幸福，也就是整個民族前途的幸福。</p>
<h3>父母子女</h3>
<p>— 修和</p>
<p>小孩子是天眞的，也是很易受感染的：「習於蒼則蒼，習於黃則黃。」因此，凡做父母的，都應該隨時隨地留意子女所處的動境。從前孟母三遷，確有至理的。因為我們偶一不愼，便會使孩子受到不良的影響。下面是一個實例：</p>
<p>有位兒童的家長告訴我：他的孩子在家竊錢浪用，而偷竊方法，則得自同座的同學。我即傅詢那同座的小友，經婉言開導後，直認曾所竊錢方法告訴他。至此，我便作進一步的探詢，問他何以知道這種方法？兒童眞不失其天眞，老實告訴我說。「有天眼爸爸去看影戲，裏面有個人偷了錢，過很快活的生活。我覺得這倒有些好玩的，便告訴同學，商量着回家去試試看！」</p>
<p>我聽後，遂加以一番勸導訴他，他淚流滿臉的連連點頭。接着又勉慰了一下，他才很受感的退去。</p>
<p>父母携帶子女觀電影，原是很好的事，但那裏知道識別力較差的孩子，竟因此感染到不良之習呢！</p>
<p>寄語有子女的父母們：請隨時隨地留意子女所處的環境，莫讓純潔無疵的天眞孩子，墜入了不幸的深淵而毫不知覺</p>
<h3>這位耶穌是誰　（二）</h3>
<p>有的人對耶穌所抱觀念，正與上面所說的相反，他們看耶穌是大敎師。他們不問耶穌的出身怎樣。他們覺得耶穌說話不像別人，像有權柄的人，這是很要緊的。瞎子領瞎子，益處何在。耶穌不是瞎子，他所敎所講，有如醫生之刀，能刺透人心，故尼哥底母覺得他是上帝差來的大敎師。他們的大難處在這裏：他們從耶穌看出上帝，却不能看明上帝即在耶穌裏面，所以他們看耶穌如平常的先生，不能認識他是人類的至大救主。還有一種觀念，是耶穌的一些門徒所抱的，就是認耶穌要成為國家的大領袖。他們看見在大衛的城中，有一個實座給耶穌置備着。但是，這種觀念也錯了。耶穌曾明確宣言，「我的國度，不是這世上的國度。」他要戴的是荊棘冠冕，只是世人不能明白。有一天耶穌在敎訓人的時候，問門徒說，「人們對我的意見怎樣，他們說我是誰？」門徒回答說，有人說他是以利亞，有人說他是耶利米，或先知中的一位。到耶穌進耶路撒冷城的日子，尚有人問，「這是誰？」有人回答說，「這是耶穌，加利利拿撒勒的先知」。這種觀念，較前者略有進步。他們答的不錯，耶穌是先知，若是當日的猶太人均能看見耶穌為先知，今日猶太國當有燦爛歷史供人瀏覽，耶穌當時也不必為所愛所望的耶路撒冷城流淚了。耶穌問過門徒，眾人對他的意見怎樣之後，復正色問門徒道，「你們說我是誰？」心直口快的彼得從眾人中擠出來大聲說，「你是基督，是上帝的兒子。」從這一句話裏，我們好像看出彼得當時眼光四射，手摸佩刀，抵死不肯改口的神氣。這種觀念，可說高明到頂點。耶穌基督，是活上帝的兒子。木匠嗎，敎師嗎？是的，領神嗎？先知嗎？也是的。但這一觀念皆不能包括耶穌。耶穌是基督，是活上帝的兒子。這是正確觀念。　如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>兒童節談兒童影片</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>近年來各國為實施電影教育起見，對於兒童影片，正大量的攝製。這樣可使任何兒童都成適合於他們的影片觀看，而不致再到電影院裏去看足以給予他不良影響的影片了。任何人都知道牟和的影片是不適合於兒童觀看的，就是有，也祇是例外的幾部。因此，一個國家如果關心電影教育，確信電影除了娛樂，更是種良好的教育工具，便會特別為兒童編製一種足以發展智力，增進知識的影片。</p>
<p>於這個問題，日內瓦國際聯盟會也很注意，所以特地設有一個電影遷入館，從事促進電影教育。到現在為止，歐美各國的教育片的作者能自由的發揮各人自己的觀念，所以作品的藝術價值却遠過於專門為影片公司編寫劇本的職業作家所寫的東西。</p>
<p>影片的效力，所以有大小，倒不在於量的多少，如果每隔兩三年出一種好影片，那這部影片所發生的效果，一定比充斥市場的那些盈千累萬的影片要大得多。可惜營利性質的影片公司，決不會在這方面努力。這正有賴於國家的能夠提倡和補助。才可疾以地推進電影教育。</p>
<p>關於這問題，更不限政府當局應得關心，就是市民的父母的人，也應保持他們為子女選擇影響的權利。如果映演的影片，在教育和藝術方面，教有價值的，不妨先由做父母的人去看，去批評，這影片究竟是否適於兒童，要是確認對兒童有益無害，然後再帶兒童去看，那是有百利而無一弊的。在這方面，影評人的指導和批評，當然，也要盡一分責任哩！</p>
<h3>萬世師表女角　葛麗亞嘉蓀小史</h3>
<p>— 良</p>
<p>倘　使你看過萬世師剛度的話，　對於這部片子的女主角葛麗亞嘉蓀　定要表示驚奇了。因為她是一個不大熱悉的明星呀！是的，她是一個銀幕新人，生在愛爾蘭北部的唐州，在很小的時候就能顯出有演戲的天才，後　曾參加一總分戲的演出，她知道她自己，除了在戲院外，什麼都對她沒有興趣，可是不幸地，她家中的父母全多不贊成她的志願，堅欲她進學校讀書，她沒有辦法反抗，只好服　她們，暫時放棄從事於戲劇的理想，先後在倫敦大學和法蘭西大學求學，後來忽然患了一場幾乎不起的嚴重的流行性感冒，醫生回答說也沒有辦法，虧得到漸漸的好了起來。但對於在學校求學的精神却永遠不能回復了。她母親至此曉得她有志於戲劇，強迫終是沒有效力的，所以也就不固執地讓她去從事於戲劇的修養了。曾先生在“Street　Scene”中演出後又至英格蘭演“Too　Trne　to　be　good”但祗是配角罷了。終於否極泰來，有一日她正坐在俱樂部裏，忽然被一個製片人所賞識，於是很快地訂了</p>
<p>紙合同，在“Golden　AT　Tow”中當主角，雖然這總片子並不怎樣好，但是她却被觀眾認為是一個新的美國女伶。後來“Old　Music”片問世，就被米高梅公司羅致了去：並且還訂了長期合同，第一次就被派定和勞勃村奈合演「萬世師表」，現在她正在等米高梅的第一次派定她的新作，愛護她的觀眾，請拭目以待罷。（移酬助難）</p>

<h3>The Chinese Air Force Attacks: Bombarding Yuncheng and Yueyang in Batches. All Thirty Japanese Planes at Yuncheng Airport Were Hit. Japanese Supplies in Yueyang Were All Destroyed, Flames Reached the Sky.</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The Japanese 6th Army Air Force has recently used Yuncheng Airport in Shanxi as a forward base, planning to indiscriminately bomb Xi'an, Luoyang, Xianyang and other places. The brave Chinese Air Force, in order to annihilate the Japanese air power and break their plans, departed at 1:50 PM on the 3rd, led by a certain unit commander, to attack the thirty Japanese aircraft parked at the airfield. They dropped large bombs, hitting all of them. When the Chinese planes arrived over the target, no Japanese planes took off to engage in combat. After completing their mission, all Chinese planes returned to base safely. At the same time, another brave Chinese Air Force unit, flying [blanks] sharp aircraft, launched a large-scale attack on Yueyang, the largest gathering place for Japanese military supplies in northern Hunan. It was observed that around the Yueyang Tower, there were over ten thousand boxes of gasoline, fifty thousand boxes of bullets, and eight thousand boxes of artillery shells. In Ganming Temple, Wu Temple, Juyin Street, and other locations in the south of the city, the Japanese high command had stored a large quantity of ammunition and food. The Chinese Air Force immediately dropped [blanks] tons of large bombs in batches, ensuring they all hit their targets. Immediately, flames soared into the sky, thick smoke rose, and the rumbling sounds of explosions were incessant. Chinese ground troops near Yueyang were extremely jubilant when they saw the Chinese eagles in the sky. The Chinese planes returned to base safely amidst cheers. (3rd dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing. According to official sources, this afternoon, two squadrons of Chinese heavy bombers attacked the Japanese airfield in Yuncheng, Shanxi, destroying thirty-five Japanese planes parked at the airfield. They also flew to Yuezhou to bomb Japanese ammunition depots and oil storage facilities. The first squadron flew to Yuncheng. Although Japanese anti-aircraft fire was heavy, all Chinese planes returned safely. There were no Japanese fighters to intercept them. The second squadron flew to Yuezhou, where the Japanese command headquarters were located, and bombed the Japanese ammunition depots and oil storage facilities. The Japanese did not resist. (3rd United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Huangpi Stir, Driven Back After Being Defeated.</h3>
<p>Fancheng. On the morning of March 23rd, over two thousand Japanese troops, divided from Huangpi and Xiaogan, launched a large-scale invasion towards the mining areas at the junction of Xiaogan, Lishan, and Huangpi counties. They engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army for a day and a night, and were defeated with over five hundred killed. Unable to withstand the attack, they retreated. The Chinese army followed and pursued them to the vicinity of Baotongdian (northwest of Huangpi) and Yangdian (northeast of Xiaogan), completely defeating the Japanese. The Japanese abandoned many corpses and objects along the way. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Near Xiaodong, Part of the Japanese Army Annihilated, Chinese Troops in Southern Guangdong Encircle and Suppress the Japanese in the Southwest Towns</h3>
<p>Shiyang. Fierce fighting is raging between Chinese and Japanese forces near Xiaodong. One night, a portion of the Japanese army was completely annihilated by Chinese forces in the northwest region of Xiaodong, with over three hundred Japanese officers and soldiers killed.

Reinforcements totaling tens of thousands of people arrived, and under the cover of machine guns and artillery, they reached the outskirts of the city on the evening of the 27th, engaging in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the Chinese. A portion even charged into the city, and the street fighting was extremely brutal. The brave soldiers of Western Suiyuan, displaying a fearless spirit, fought more and more courageously.

<h3>Japan Attempts to Sow Discord Between the Kuomintang and the Communists, Scheme Unsuccessful. Japan Changed Its Strategy Towards the Communists in an Attempt to Create a New Situation, Which Did Not Succeed.</h3>
<p>Chongqing. After thorough inquiries by Reuters from well-informed sources, it has been learned of Japan's attempts to use the Chinese Communist Party to deal with the Nationalist government in detail. When friction occurred between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, the leaders of both parties made various efforts to prevent serious consequences, and the opinions between the two parties were satisfactorily resolved. Several months ago, the strategy of the Japanese army, especially in North China, had a notable change. The Japanese army seemed to have [blanks] not take military action against the Chinese Communist army, commonly known as the Eighth Route Army. Because the Communist Party army and the Nationalist government army were both in North China [blanks] fighting, friction occurred between the two sides as a result of the sudden change in Japanese policy. The motivation of the Japanese policy was to increase the strength of the Chinese Communist army, in order to harass the Chongqing government. The Japanese hoped to create a new situation so that Chongqing would have to fight against Japan on the one hand and deal with the growing Communist Party on the other. With divided intentions, they could not deal with Japan with all their energy, but their plan did not succeed. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Children's Day</h3>
<p>The founding of "April 4th" Children's Day has only been nine years ago. Every year on this day, celebrations are held everywhere, and there are various measures to benefit children. However, apart from a few children who participate voluntarily, most of the events held on the holiday are organized by educational institutions and cultural groups. As for the general society, it does not seem to feel a strong interest, nor has it produced any reaction. Not only that, but apart from holidays, children's movements do not seem to have been valued as much as other social movements. Given the ubiquity of children, the phenomenon of Children's Day and children's movements is as such. Unless one says it is because the history of nine years is very short, it is difficult to find a more satisfactory excuse.</p>
<p>Children are the masters of the future society, which is where the fundamental lifeline of the country lies. Especially at a time of transition for survival, abolition of the old, and establishment of the new, the issue of children should be considered as the top priority in national policy. China is facing such an extraordinary era, and the current generation is shouldering the sacred great cause of resisting Japan and saving the nation. However, the future work of restoration will inevitably be ten or a hundred times more arduous and complicated than today's resistance. This heavy responsibility has already been destined to fall on the next generation of citizens. Whether they can fully exert their great abilities and create new miracles in the five-thousand-year history of the Chinese nation's nation-building depends entirely on how we work hard to nurture and educate children today. The Chinese authorities have also paid considerable attention to this issue since the war began. The establishment of children's welfare homes and educational institutions throughout the country, President Chiang's repeated telegrams of appreciation to elementary school teachers across the country, and the various measures taken by the education authorities for children's education and family education are undoubtedly focused on this generation, the new force for the future revival of China. Therefore, on the occasion of celebrating Children's Day today, in addition to the various celebratory measures in form, we should also seriously consider how to coordinate children's movements with the great mission of the extraordinary period.</p>
<p>First, we should strive to protect the survival of children. In the nearly three years of the War of Resistance, I don't know how many innocent and lively children have been sacrificed in the cruel bombings and ruthless artillery fire. I also don't know how many vibrant children have died unjustly from suffering, and I also don't know how many happy families' children have become orphaned refugees in an instant. This kind of loss to the country and the nation will never be estimated how great it is. Naturally, some of them belong to the category that cannot be avoided or remedied, but there must also be many due to human and human shortcomings. If the evacuation and rescue work can be more effective, many casualties can be avoided. If the work of caring for refugee children can be more widespread, it will definitely save more vitality for the country. Even in the Shanghai Concession, the number of children on the starvation line is countless, and the mortality rate of infants and young children in the Municipal Council's monthly death reports is astonishingly high. We can't help but appeal to these young citizens, hoping that all parties will pay close attention to them and find ways to solve their welfare problems.</p>
<p>Second, we must step up the training of children's spiritual fortresses. Innocence and simplicity are the characteristics of children, and are also equivalent to a blank sheet of paper. With excellent and correct training and cultivation, they will definitely form a healthy and determined national character. If unfortunately encountered by the contamination of an evil environment, it will also delay the children's lifelong future. During the War of Resistance, the most heartbreaking scene was to make those children who could not escape from the occupied areas even more trapped and become the objects of the invaders. Every day they are instilled with enslaved consciousness, painting their white and pure souls. This is the most despicable crime above armed aggression, and all people with a sense of justice must take responsibility to find ways to save them. As for the inland areas, all those who have the responsibility of educating children should naturally take the training of national spirit as the first essential of education. This is a basic education that is more important than the instillation of all knowledge and skills.</p>
<p>China's new-style education has only been forty years old, and although it still has many shortcomings, in terms of the effect on the country and the nation, it has already achieved significant success. This can be understood by comparing the current War of Resistance with the Sino-Japanese War. Looking back at the education in those forty years, on the one hand, it was connected to the long dark age, and on the other hand, it had to fight against the ugly society and the unstable politics. It is natural that its own experiences have been full of hardships and it is difficult to achieve soundness, but it has already made contributions to the country and the nation, that is, the country and the nation have already gained. This shows the greatness of the educational function. Today's generation of children, born in such a turbulent era, suffer from various mental and material distress, which should be considered unfortunate. But on the other hand, what they have come into contact with is not only the lectures in the classroom and the knowledge in the textbooks, but the vivid reality and the experience of personal life. Looking at their every move, every word and deed, they are already very different from the past. What's more, the corruption and ugliness left over from the five-thousand-year ancient culture have been tempered by the great era, so the citizens nurtured in this era are inherently more handsome and healthy than their previous generation. Therefore, the future nation-building work inherently contains a bright and splendid future. However, it must also be able to exert the greatest efforts in terms of personnel to meet the current needs, so that children's welfare and cultivation can all exert great effects. This is another natural duty of every Chinese today besides striving for the War of Resistance, and it is also what should be paid special attention to on this Children's Day.</p>
<h3>Third Meeting of the National Political Council: Zhang Jia'ao and Weng Wenhao Report on Transportation and Economic Conditions; Unanimous Approval to Send Condolences to Frontline Soldiers and Sympathies to Compatriots in War Zones</h3>

<p>Telegram of Condolences to Soldiers and Compatriots</p>
<p>Chongqing: The National Political Council passed two telegrams at its third meeting today, one to comfort the frontline soldiers and the other to express sympathy to the compatriots in the war zones. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Telegram of condolences to the frontline soldiers: To Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission, and to the frontline soldiers: Since the beginning of the War of Resistance, our loyal and brave soldiers, under the command of the supreme commander, have killed the enemy and achieved results, defended the country, endured hardships, and become stronger in battle. The recent great victories in northern Hunan and northern Guangdong, and the thwarting of the enemy in southern Guangxi and western Suiyuan, have shifted the overall situation of the War of Resistance and laid the foundation for victory. Their merit lies with the country and will forever be recorded in history. This is due to the effective leadership of our supreme commander, and the dedication and bravery of our national soldiers in battle, which have left an indelible glory in the hearts of the people. We should unite as one, share the same hatred for the enemy, expel the Japanese army, and swiftly carry out divine punishment. We are willing to encourage each other with the soldiers. On the occasion of the fifth session of this council, we respectfully express our condolences and encouragement together. The National Political Council, Jiang. (2) Telegram of sympathy to the compatriots in the war zones: To the Military Affairs Commission, to be forwarded to the compatriots in the war zones: The Japanese army has deeply penetrated for three years now. The suffering and pain experienced by our compatriots in the war zones cannot be described in words. Our compatriots are determined to love the country and unwilling to be trampled upon. Some have requested to fight the enemy, their spirit soaring to the clouds, while others have sacrificed their lives, their glory illuminating the sun and moon. All these commendable and moving deeds prove that the spirit of our nation cannot be extinguished. Our compatriots have always distinguished between loyalty and treachery, and recognized the difference between obedience and defiance. They will endure hardship for a moment, and further encourage loyalty and integrity. As the situation of the War of Resistance improves daily, the members of this council specially express their sincere condolences to our compatriots in the war zones, and are willing to share with our compatriots the arduous tasks of the War of Resistance and national construction, in order to achieve the final victory. We hope that our compatriots will take note of this. The National Political Council, ninth session, Jiang. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The National Political Council issued a telegram denouncing the puppet organization in Nanjing, stating that Wang Zhaoming had long been wanted by the government, and this council also issued a telegram denouncing him at the fourth session. Unexpectedly, he showed no remorse and signed a secret agreement with the Japanese invaders. Under the protection and direction of the Japanese invaders, he established a puppet organization in Nanjing, intending to implement the secret agreement to destroy China. It is clearly destroying independence, yet he calls it independence; it is clearly losing freedom, yet he calls it freedom. In fact, all tangible and intangible rights entrusted to national sovereignty and the lifeline of the nation, including political, military, economic, and resource rights, are completely handed over to the Japanese. Yet they shamelessly claim to be saving the country through peace. At the extreme, they want the Chinese nation to perish without knowing it, and to gradually forget all the conditions that an independent country must possess. There has never been a case of surrendering to the enemy to save the country, calling the destruction of the country peace, justifying assisting the enemy in its aggression, or preaching ideologies while surrendering on behalf of the enemy. Since being elected to the council in 1938, we have, under the guiding principles of resistance and national construction, represented the public opinion of the country, assisted the government, and jointly overcome national difficulties. We express our deep hatred for this behavior and once again encourage the military and civilians to jointly punish and eliminate him. As a result of our military and civilians' brave resistance over the past three years, Japan's foundation has been shaken and its people are in panic. The Japanese invaders, although their ambition has not died, have lost their confidence. Their contemptible act of supporting Wang is actually their last futile attempt. Therefore, our military and civilians must respect the achievements of the past, strengthen their confidence in victory, and from now on, with one heart and one mind, strive to fight and give the Japanese their final blow. Furthermore, our compatriots in the front and rear and in the guerrilla areas must always remember the great righteousness that national sovereignty is sacred and inviolable, and the truth that our resistance will surely succeed and our nation will surely be built. How can there be a government in the occupied areas of the Japanese army? How can a false agreement have any effect? How can the national sovereignty safeguarded by the blood and sweat of 450 million compatriots be stolen by the Japanese puppets? How can the international reputation earned by countless loyal and brave soldiers and various diligent workers through three years of bloody battles be shaken by the Japanese? Therefore, only by strengthening the Chinese nation's determination to resist and seeking the most rapid victory can we achieve our goals. As for the friendly nations of the world, they have long had a correct understanding and will not be misled by Japanese puppet propaganda. It goes without saying that the cleansing of filth and the restoration of our homeland depend on the intensified efforts of all compatriots. Respectfully submitted for your consideration.

<h3>Nationwide Financial Network Gradually Completed: Four Major Banks Establish Branches Throughout the Country, Exceeding 300 Locations Including the Southwest and Northwest</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Ministry of Finance, in order to circulate finance in the rear and strengthen economic power, had previously formulated a two-year plan to complete the financial network in the southwest, northwest, and neighboring war zones. The steps are as follows: (1) For towns and cities in the rear that are related to politics, economy, transportation, and commodity distribution, and that do not yet have branches of the four major banks, the Joint Office of the Four Banks is responsible for ensuring that at least one bank goes to establish an agency. (2) For locations that are slightly remote, the four banks may not be able to take care of them in the short term, so the provincial banks of each province are responsible for ensuring that they go to establish branches, with the principle of at least one bank in each location. (3) In the process of establishing branches in various towns and cities, the cooperative treasury and the postal savings and remittance bureau will assist in the local financial turnover and remittance circulation. (4) The same shall apply to establishing branches in areas adjacent to the war zone. In the first phase of completing the financial network, the four banks have established a total of 154 new branches in the southwest and northwest regions for the above-mentioned purposes. Among them, the Central Bank added 33 branches, the Bank of China 59, the Bank of Communications 26, and the Farmers Bank 36. The areas where new branches were established include 63 in Sichuan, 18 in Yunnan, 18 in Guizhou, 21 in Guangxi, 2 in Guangdong, 5 in Hunan, 15 in Shaanxi, 14 in Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia combined, and 3 in Xikang. In addition, 60 branches were added in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hubei, and Fujian provinces. In total, the four major banks have more than 300 branches throughout the country. In addition, more than 60 branches are planned to be established in the southwest and northwest in stages. It is estimated that the great plan to complete the nationwide financial network can be completed within this year. (3rd dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan Expresses Apology for Anti-British Riot in Zhangde</h3>
<p>Beiping: On March 19, Luo Pei, the British Vice-Consul stationed in Beiping, and two members of the Canadian Church were investigating the damage to church property in Zhangde when they encountered an organized anti-British demonstration. A group of Chinese rushed into the hotel where the three British people were staying and attacked the British Vice-Consul. The British Embassy in Beiping protested to the Japanese Embassy, accusing the Japanese side of failing to provide adequate protection. It is now heard that the British authorities have received an apology from the Japanese authorities for this "unfortunate incident." A Japanese military spokesman stated that he felt sincere regret for the occurrence of such an incident. Therefore, the British Embassy authorities here have received instructions not to take further action on this matter. (3rd dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Note from Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Envoys of Various Countries Unanimously Published in Soviet Newspapers: The So-Called "New Order in East Asia" Will Encounter Great Difficulties; The Chinese People's Determination to Resist Will Surely Achieve Victory</h3>
<p>Moscow: All major newspapers have unanimously published the full text of the note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the envoys of various countries, denying the puppet organization. Soviet people expressed indignation after learning of the establishment of the puppet organization, and recognized that the puppet organization is merely a tool of Japanese imperialism. Political figures also stated that the Japanese army's establishment of the so-called "New Order in East Asia" will inevitably encounter great difficulties. Recently, Soviet newspapers have continuously criticized the puppet organization, which proves the direction of public opinion. For example, the Labor Daily published an article on January 26 by Soviet Supreme Soviet representative Sobolev, which stated, "We hope that China will win the War of Resistance. The Soviet people are paying close attention to Japan's scheme to establish a puppet organization. However, I dare to say that this farcical drama will surely arouse the indignation of the Soviet people. Japan is now dreaming of becoming the master of East Asia, and is using the organization of a small number of people to threaten 450 million people." The Truth newspaper of March 25 also wrote, "The reason why the Japanese warlords are eager to establish a puppet organization is that their position in the occupied areas is not as solid as before, so they want the puppet organization to maintain it. The slogan of the puppet organization is peace and anti-communism. However, since (1937), the Chinese people have known that the true meaning of this slogan is to trap the Chinese people in a position of slavery." Yesterday's Truth newspaper also published an article examining Japan's economic difficulties, the content of which was largely taken from the American "National Weekly." The conclusion stated that Japan's recent statement that it does not want to advance further into China is not its political wisdom, but its military necessity. Although Japan has not yet collapsed, China's chances of winning are greater than Japan's. The puppet organization will never weaken the Chinese people's determination to resist. (2nd dispatch)</p>

<h3>United States Must Consider Embargo for the Sake of Public Opinion and National Reputation; Retaining Rights in China, If Trampled Upon, Can Immediately Take Retaliatory Measures</h3>
<p>New York: The New York Public Opinion Forum published an editorial on the relations between the United States and Japan, stating that Rear Admiral Yarnall, the former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, recently said that Japan's adventurous behavior in Asia has sunk deep into the mud, and that fighting the United States again would be tantamount to suicide. The implication is that Japan is not yet prepared for suicide. Rear Admiral Yarnall is not one to make alarmist statements, and we share his views. As for whether the United States should prohibit the shipment of certain goods to Japan after the expiration of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty, the country would not immediately use it as a reason for declaring war, which is almost meaningless. However, the Japanese government had previously allowed newspapers to publish fierce articles commenting on the embargo issue. It can be seen that if the US Congress does pass an embargo bill, Japanese public opinion will definitely strongly demand that the country's government take retaliatory measures, which the country's government may find difficult to refuse at that time. This should not be ignored. Even if Japan has the possibility of taking retaliatory measures, we cannot therefore fail to consider embargo measures. Considering the situation, public opinion, and national honor, if Americans believe that the embargo is a necessary course of action, then it will be difficult to use the risks that this measure may entail as an argument to dissuade them. However, if Americans want to take this risk, they must prepare in advance and pay close attention to it. (2nd dispatch, Havas)</p>
<p>Washington: The Washington Daily News said, "If Japanese soldiers force the Jingwei to trample upon the rights that the United States still retains in China, then the United States government should constantly send notes to this meticulously protected gentleman, and at the same time indicate to the Japanese government that the United States may prohibit the export of certain goods to Japan, or may impose special taxes on goods imported into the United States from Japan. These two methods can be implemented simultaneously." (2nd dispatch, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Actually Publish Articles Blaming American Arbitrariness, Threatening That the Difficult Situation in the Far East Cannot Be Resolved</h3>
<p>Tokyo: A certain Japanese newspaper recently published an editorial comparing the attitudes of the British and American ambassadors in Tokyo, and believed that the United States' attitude towards Japan's policy was "arrogant." The newspaper pointed out that US Ambassador to Japan Grew made inflammatory remarks about Japan's actions in China, saying that the United States was not self-restrained and was attempting to judge Japan's behavior. If the United States insists on this attitude, the difficult situation in the Far East will persist and cannot be resolved. The United States is truly arbitrary and does not observe reality. The newspaper also claimed that although Britain's activities in China are not in harmony with Japan's, it can understand the reality and study the position it should take to protect and develop its interests. "The new government in Nanjing" seems to have "constituted an important factor and cannot be overturned by any opposing opinion." (3rd dispatch, United Press)</p>
<h3>Political Offensive: Hull's Strong Declaration Deals a Major Blow to Japan</h3>
<p>Paris: The establishment of the "Wang Jingwei regime" was recently commented on by the Progressive Socialist Party's Enterprise News, which stated, "The Italian government submitted an answer almost immediately after receiving the notification from the 'Wang regime.' Therefore, the Japanese government was very pleased yesterday morning. On the contrary, the news from Washington did not make Tokyo feel happy. As far as we know, difficulties arise between the 'Wang regime' and the Japanese government every day. In fact, Wang intends for Japan to pacify China on its behalf, while the Japanese government only seeks its own interests and limits the power of the 'Wang regime' to the major cities, not allowing it to expand. For this reason, the two sides are arguing strongly over the issue of authority, and are criticizing each other for 'quibbling over the words.' Until US Secretary of State Hull issued a declaration stating that the country only recognizes the Chongqing National Government, the Japanese government suffered a major blow. Some of the people around Prime Minister Yonai still have an illusion that Britain and France may not hold the same views as the United States. However, some newspapers do not think so, and criticize the Yonai cabinet for not expressing satisfaction with the 'Wang regime,' because the establishment of the 'Wang regime' does not mean that the China Incident is about to end. 'Those newspapers know it very well.'" (3rd dispatch, Havas)</p>
<h3>US Navy Conducts Preliminary Exercises in the Pacific: Navy Secretary Edison Personally Commands; Large Fleet Has Sailed to Hawaii</h3>
<p>San Pedro: The US Navy's "Black" and "White" fleets have conducted preliminary exercises in the Pacific. A large fleet has sailed to Hawaii to begin the 1940 exercises in clear weather. Yesterday morning, the fleet advanced one after another. Shortly after midnight, the first destroyer left the port of San Diego, followed by three others. The destroyers waited outside the port for the cruisers to sail out and form a line. The battleships left the port last. Navy Secretary Edison and US Fleet Commander-in-Chief Richardson commanded together on the aft deck of the flagship "Pennsylvania." It is heard that after the large ships refuel and take on water in Hawaii, they will be divided into "Purple" and "Maroon" fleets to engage in large-scale naval exercises. (3rd dispatch, United Press)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Saodang News here recently published an article commenting on the US naval maneuvers, stating that the US Navy's large-scale maneuvers in the Pacific are actually a posture against the puppet government in Nanjing. US Secretary of State Hull has already stated that he does not recognize the puppet government and has also criticized Japan's attempt to monopolize China and harm the interests of third countries. Therefore, this exercise is sufficient to show that after Hull's statement on March 30, the US Army, Navy, and Air Force are preparing. It can also be said to be the prelude to the US blockade of Japan, and it can be regarded as the US stepping up efforts to consolidate the defense of the Pacific, so that Japan's southward advance will suffer a serious blow.

<h3>Japan Will Send Kato to Central and South America</h3>
<p>Nanjing: Japanese newspapers reported that Kato Gaimatsu, the Japanese special envoy to China, will be appointed as a special envoy to Central and South American countries. The Japanese government's dispatch of Kato to Central and South American countries is linked to the Tokyo government's policy of correcting its economic dependence on the United States and simultaneously expanding Japanese trade with Latin American countries. The Japanese government has been working hard to promote Japanese trade with Central and South American countries. Economic survey groups from Argentina and Peru recently visited Japan, and an economic survey group from Mexico is also on its way to Japan. Kato will leave Japan for the United States in early April. (3rd dispatch, United Press)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Japan's Speech Attracts Attention of Members of Parliament; Since Butler's Reply to the Labor Party's Inquiry, There Has Been No Fundamental Change in British Far East Policy</h3>
<p>London: The speech delivered by Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, at the dinner party of the Japan-British Association in Tokyo on the 28th of last month, has attracted the attention of members of the Lower House. At the afternoon session of the Lower House today, Labor Party member Baker asked, "Does Ambassador Craigie's speech mean that the government's current policy in the Far East is about to change, or does the government still intend to thoroughly implement the policy of assisting the National Government of China? Please ask the Prime Minister to explain." Undersecretary Butler immediately replied, "Foreign Secretary Halifax has already taken note of this speech. Our envoys abroad are not in the habit of seeking the Foreign Secretary's agreement on the content of their speeches beforehand. However, Foreign Secretary Halifax is still prepared to take responsibility for the points made by Ambassador Craigie. The Ambassador also asked me to state on his behalf that his original intention was not to say that there has been any change in the country's current policy, or that there is any discrepancy with what the government has repeatedly told the Lower House. It can be seen that the government's view of continuing to recognize the Chongqing National Government as the legitimate government of China, and its general attitude towards the Far East issue, have not changed in any way. That is, the government's desire for the Far East dispute to be resolved according to fair conditions has never changed." (3rd dispatch, Havas)</p>
<h3>Japan Conspires with Germany, Italy, and Spain in Secret, Allegedly Granting Economic Privileges</h3>

Well-informed sources said that the "Nanjing Government" may be recognized by Madrid and Rome, with preferential economic conditions in China as an exchange. According to Le Parisien, Tokyo is putting pressure on Berlin to avoid weakening its friendly relations with Berlin and Rome. The newspaper said that if Moscow guarantees that it will not intensify its military intentions in the Far East after the end of the Soviet-Finnish war during the meeting between Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, then Tokyo can also obtain a guarantee as a result.

<h3>Foreign Military Experts Claim: Chinese Troops Fight Bravely, Recapturing Kunlun Pass and Achieving Objective</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to a foreign military expert who witnessed the Chinese troops recapturing the strategically important Kunlun Pass northeast of Nanning a few months ago, the bravery of the Chinese soldiers is truly admirable.  This location serves as the gateway to Nanning, and the Japanese army had stationed a large force to defend it. The Chinese army, in an attempt to recapture Nanning, launched a fierce offensive. Despite suffering serious losses, they ultimately achieved their objective of recapturing the pass.  It is said that the Chinese army lost nine tanks during the offensive, but according to the Chinese army, three of them have been recovered.  The expert personally witnessed three tanks being towed back for repairs. The expert highly praised the fighting spirit of the Chinese soldiers and was particularly impressed by the achievements of some small squads. He believes that the Chinese military authorities should not only promote commanders or give soldiers cash as rewards but also award medals to encourage lower-ranking officers and soldiers. The expert believes that the Chinese army's offensive on Kunlun Pass seemed to lack "sustained effort," which is crucial in any large-scale military operation. If the Chinese army could capitalize on its gains and continue to strike the enemy, the significance of this battle would be even greater. The expert also commented on the Japanese army's attack on Pinyang, saying it was merely a raid. The Japanese army sent a brigade to carry out a large detour to try to relieve the crisis at Kunlun Pass. However, this move by the Japanese army was a little too late, because while the Japanese army was still taking the offensive, the Chinese army had already recaptured the pass.  Even under these circumstances, the Japanese army continued to advance towards Pinyang because the Japanese army on this route belonged to a raiding force and did not attempt to maintain contact with the rear, so it was intercepted by the Chinese army. Due to the lack of sufficient coordinated action by the Chinese army units, most of the Japanese army was still able to retreat towards Nanning. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Declares: Strengthening Economic Warfare Against Germany, Determined to Strictly Limit Neutral Country Trade, Declares Willingness to Maintain Balkan Peace</h3>
<p>London – British Prime Minister Chamberlain discussed in the House of Commons last night the British attitude towards neutral countries supplying Germany with goods and the situation in the Balkan Peninsula. When he spoke about goods being shipped to Germany, he issued the statement, "We want to adopt a corresponding plan," implying an intensification of the economic blockade. Chamberlain also refuted German propaganda accusing the Allied powers of deliberately disrupting peace in the Balkan Peninsula. Chamberlain said, “Germany may have found ways to increase supplies from neutral countries using routes not previously used. We have paid attention to this possibility. We have reviewed the general situation and plan to adopt a corresponding plan. On this point, I can inform the members of the House that the British government has recently intercepted in the Far East territorial waters a Soviet ship suspected of carrying contraband to Vladivostok for transshipment to Germany. The wartime commercial agreements we have concluded all contain clauses restricting neutral countries from transporting their domestic products to Germany. To cite an example, this clause stipulates that the export to Germany of oils and fats necessary for Germany's war effort must be strictly limited. In addition, our procurement methods are also a powerful weapon in our arsenal. We certainly cannot purchase all the surplus that Germany's neighboring countries can export, but we are actively increasing purchases of certain selected goods, such as mineral oil and fats, and now the supply of these goods to Germany has been greatly reduced. For example, we have now agreed to buy all the surplus whale oil available for export from Norway this season. Although I am not at liberty to elaborate, I can say that the Allied powers are procuring minerals in Southeast Europe on a very large scale. British trade with Germany's neighbors has indeed developed greatly, and I hope that the strengthening of trade exchanges will benefit both sides. At the same time, the countries concerned must understand that if they are not prepared to give us guarantees that they will limit their subsequent trade with Germany, then we cannot rely on them to obtain products from the British Empire. We have recently heard about the possible developments in Southeast Europe. German propaganda even says that the aim of the Allied powers is to disrupt the peace of the Balkan Peninsula countries, but this is not the case. We have made very effective contributions to Turkey to maintain peace and security in Southeast Europe. In order to study many urgent political and economic issues, the British government has decided to recall the ministers stationed in the Balkan countries to the UK for discussion, and the British ambassador to Italy will also take a short leave of absence to come to London at this time. I expect the House will welcome this move. We hope that the discussions of the British ministers in the Balkan countries in London will have a positive result for the Allied powers' doctrine and the maintenance of peace and security in the Balkans.” (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>British Diplomatic Maneuvering: European Situation Enters New Phase, Britain Concludes Wartime Trade Agreements Separately With Neutral Countries</h3>
<p>London – Authoritative sources here said today that Britain has concluded new wartime trade agreements with four neutral countries, and another four more important agreements have also been drafted. According to reports from senior officials, the agreements contain important clauses according to which neutral countries will no longer re-export goods and raw materials to Germany. According to British and French diplomatic warfare in Europe, efforts are being made to starve Germany and fill the loopholes in its blockade lines in Scandinavia, the Balkans, and Denmark, Belgium, etc. Therefore, the conclusion of the above agreements indicates that the European diplomatic war has entered a new phase. It is said that the efforts of Britain and France are particularly focused on the Balkan countries. It is also said that among these agreements, those signed with Denmark and the Netherlands have already signed the first letter. The clauses stipulate that the two neutral countries of Denmark and the Netherlands can import goods sufficient for their normal needs without any hindrance, but they must not use the raw materials they import to make goods and then re-export them to Germany. Those concluded with Greece and Spain have also been completed. In addition, it is also said that the British-South African commercial negotiations were held here yesterday, and similar consultations between Britain and Romania will also be held in the next few days. As for the clause in the agreement that forces neutral countries to voluntarily not re-export to Germany, it comes from the unilateral opinion of the United Kingdom, so the neutral countries will not adopt severe blockade measures based on this clause, as the United States did when it joined the last World War in 1918. According to a British spokesperson, although the Allied powers feel the need to intensify the blockade, the government believes that the rationing system of giving food by the day in 1918 is a last resort. The spokesperson also said that "the Soviet Union's supply to Germany" is not a cause for concern. The Soviet Union is too busy to supply itself, let alone Germany.

<h3>Neutral Countries: Feel Uneasy, Deeply Fear German Retaliation</h3>
<p>Amsterdam – After reading Chamberlain's speech, political circles here are not without anxiety and still believe that Britain has not fully understood the position of neutral countries. Giving Britain a guarantee to restrict trade with Germany is a non-neutral action and will put the Netherlands at risk of retaliatory action from Germany. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin – Political circles here believe that British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks indicate that the Allied powers will regard the rights of neutral countries as non-existent whenever they deem it appropriate. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Berlin – Regarding the speech given by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons yesterday, German political figures have recently commented, stating that the statement proves two points: (1) Britain and France have decided to infringe on the neutrality of other countries at any time, because Chamberlain declared that British warships will be prepared to attack German merchant ships within the territorial waters of Scandinavian countries in the future; (2) Britain and France are prepared to destroy the entire economic structure of Europe.

<h3>Sweden Reaffirms Strict Neutrality: Determined to Exert National Strength to Uphold Independent Rights</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital – Swedish Minister of Defense Scholt said in Uppsala last night that if Swedish territory is attacked, the Swedish people will exert all their strength to expel the invaders. If anyone threatens Sweden's independence, Sweden will do its best to defend itself with arms. As long as the European powers fight to the death, Sweden's fate will be precarious. New and serious threats will occur at any time, so the Swedish people must prepare for the worst and never slack off. A weak country whose strength does not allow it to be involved in threats, Sweden must adopt a neutrality policy based on respecting Sweden's legitimate rights and treating the warring nations impartially in order to seek Sweden's independence.

<h3>Goering Urges the Air Force Youth League: To Strive Hard Externally, So As To Achieve The Purpose Of Glorious Victory</h3>
<p>Berlin – German Aviation Minister General Goering delivered a speech to the Hitler Youth Aviation League in the auditorium of the new Air Force building today and broadcast it to factories, schools, and companies across the country. His words were roughly as follows: I would like to remind you that what the leader Hitler said about Germany's current hard struggle will create the most glorious victory in German history. Germany has now entered the second stage of the struggle. The first stage has ended victoriously. The first stage is the struggle of National Socialism. During the World War, Germany endured for four and a half years with the greatest strength. After the war, Germany was almost exhausted, but at this historical turning point, Hitler rose to lead the people to carry out the work of national revival. This first stage of the struggle has now been successfully completed on January 30, 1933. What follows is the second stage of external struggle, which is currently at its most intense. External struggles can also be successful, just like the result of the first stage of internal struggle. In fact, the environment of the first stage of struggle was more difficult than the current one, because at that time there was a lack of human and material resources, relying only on the belief of the nation. General Goering then solemnly stated that the preliminary condition for building a great Germany is to build Germany's new air force. Today, the amazing achievements of the German air force have been recognized by young people across the country and will have even greater achievements in the future. Speaking to this point, Goering briefly described the process of Germany's annexation of the Sudetenland, Memel region, and the establishment of the Polish Protectorate, and then said that the dreams of thousands of years of Germany have now been realized. Great Germany has been created by Hitler and has become one of the world's powers again. German youth should be determined to continue the struggle and create Germany's future. The enemy's current war aim is to plunge Germany back into a weak country. When Germany was working hard on revival and reconstruction, the enemy tried to hinder it in many ways, but it was ultimately ineffective, thus causing this war. At this point, the enemy will be taught a lesson for attacking Germany. The Polish war was a major blow to the enemy. Germany has no fear of being attacked from both the front and the back. The German air force can fully resist Britain and France on the Western Front. The leader Hitler has announced to the national army that they are responsible for protecting the country. You young people should work together for the glory and freedom of Germany in the future. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)</p>

<p>Paris – Former French Finance Minister, now Prime Minister Reynaud, and U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles reviewed a map of European borders at a meeting at the French Ministry of Finance the other day. The outside world saw this map and thought that the Allied powers wanted to create a future Europe by dividing the land and creating territories such as Poland and Austria. The French Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a communiqué to dispel the rumors, saying that this map shows the European borders before Germany's repeated invasions in recent years. However, when the photographer made this country, he mentioned some border lines. Italian newspapers mistakenly believed that this map included the Italian Trieste region in Austrian territory, and public opinion was in an uproar. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<h3>British Wartime Cabinet: To Be Reorganized Imminently</h3>
<p>London – It is generally expected that Prime Minister Chamberlain will take the opportunity of the death of Minister of Navigation Kilmore to announce changes to cabinet members. No one knows the Prime Minister's will yet, but it is expected that First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill may concurrently serve as the director of a new agency with the nature of a national defense conference. This does not seem to affect the position of the current Minister for Coordination of Defence. Hoare and Wood seem to be swapped positions, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and Minister of Food Morrison may leave the Ministry of Food and be able to take on other duties, but will still retain the first position. The vacant position of Minister of Food will be filled by Hulton, who has been assisting with everything in the Ministry of Supply since the outbreak of the war. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>

<h3>German, Italian, and South Cabinets: Arrive in Hungarian Capital Together, The Mission Undertaken By This Trip Attracts Attention From All Parties</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital – Minister Without Portfolio Konstantinovic, a well-known jurist, recently went to the Hungarian capital with Minister of Agriculture Subrilovic. Hearing this, all the onlookers were deeply surprised, saying that the trip of the two men happened to coincide with the simultaneous arrival of German Minister of Agriculture Darré and Italian Minister of Agriculture Basianteri in Hungary, which was very noteworthy. Since Konstantinovic is a jurist, he has no experience in discussing economic issues. This time, he is accompanying the Minister of Agriculture to Hungary. It is difficult to say whether there are other missions. However, well-informed sources believe that there have been frequent exchanges between Hungary and South Korea recently. This trip by the South Korean cabinet members is just a continuation of expressing their eagerness to approach Hungary. (Havas News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<h3>US Democratic Party Presidential Primary: Roosevelt Wins Big</h3>
<p>Milwaukee – During the Wisconsin Democratic Party's presidential primary vote, those who decided to re-elect Roosevelt as president won the majority of votes. According to a recent report from 1844 districts, those who decided to elect Roosevelt received 168,210 votes, while those who decided to elect Garner received 56,806 votes. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>New York – The New York State Democratic Party recently held a primary to nominate candidates for the general election. As a result, President Roosevelt received an overwhelming majority, far more than Vice President Garner. Therefore, if President Roosevelt decides to participate in the general election, the 94 votes of the New York State delegation can be guaranteed to support him at the Democratic National Convention.

<h3>Molotov's Speech: Full Text (Continued and Completed)</h3>
<p>In short, the Soviet Union's treaties with Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia are being faithfully implemented. The overall development of relations between the three countries is truly unlimited.</p>
<p>Recently, foreign newspapers have expressed great concern about the Soviet Union and its relationship with its southern border neighbors, especially the Caucasus border and Romania. Our government also feels that there is no reason for our relations with our southern neighbors to deteriorate. This is self-evident. The UK and France are organizing colonial armies in Syria and the Near East, led by General Weygand, undertaking large-scale suspicious activities. This is a matter of fact. We must be vigilant against any attempt to use these colonial or non-colonial troops to take anti-Soviet action. Any such attempt will trigger our action against the aggressors. Countries that are hostile to the Soviet Union or neighbors that will become tools of aggression against the Soviet Union will clearly see the consequences. As for our country's relations with Turkey and Iran, they can be determined by the mutual non-aggression treaties of both parties and the Soviet Union's determination to abide by its obligations. Our country's economic relations with Iran can be adjusted by the Soviet-Iranian trade agreement signed not long ago. Among the southern neighbors I mentioned, Romania does not have a mutual non-aggression treaty with us. This is because there are unresolved disputes between the two countries. The Soviet Union has never recognized Romania's occupation of Bessarabia, but has never raised the issue of recovering Bessarabia by military force. Therefore, there is no reason for the deterioration of Soviet-Romanian relations. Although our country has long withdrawn its ambassador to Romania and replaced him with a counselor, this was caused by special circumstances in the recent past.</p>
<p>Regarding this point, we should remember the Romanian authorities' treatment of the former Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Romania, Butenko, in 1938. Butenko suddenly disappeared in Romania and has not been heard from since, but the Romanian authorities deny any involvement in the matter.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that such facts should never happen in civilized and orderly countries. The reason why the Soviet Union has been slow to send a new ambassador to Romania since then does not need to be explained. We believe that the Romanian authorities have recognized the Soviet Union's determination not to tolerate such behavior. The Soviet government has now taken steps to connect the areas leading to the Soviet Union and the original area of the Karelian Isthmus. The Petrozavodsk-Suoyarvi railway, which has already been built, connects the capital of Karelia and the Murmansk Railway with the Suoyarvi-Raivola line. The Kandalaksha-Kuolajärvi line is currently under construction and will be completed soon. This line will connect Karelia with the area of Kuolajärvi in the Soviet Union. With the exception of a small portion, the industry incorporated into Karelian territory is handled by the Karelian Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>
<p>Since this time the Karelian Republic is one of the federations, there is a need to discuss its name. The entire Karelian region does not completely belong to Karelia. A part of it is purely Finnish territory. The Finnish and Karelian peoples have close relations in terms of race and bloodline. This time, changing the Karelian Autonomous Republic to the Karelian-Finnish Federal Republic will enable the economic and cultural development of the two ethnic groups to be further developed and their friendship to be further enhanced, while eliminating their accumulated hatred of many years. The Soviet Council of People's Commissars has authorized me to draft regulations on the renaming of Karelia and submit them to the Supreme Soviet for review.</p>
<p>This new Federal Republic will participate in the other Federal Republics of the Soviet Union. This is a major new development in the unity of the various Federations of the Soviet Union. During this era of imperialist enslavement of the masses, imperialist wars have intensified national and colonial oppression. The rights and interests of small countries have become pocket change in the hands of imperialists. The establishment of our new Federal Republic during this period is enough to emphasize the benefits of the Soviet system guaranteeing the full development of small countries.</p>
<p>I am convinced that the Karelian-Finnish Federal Republic will not only become a barrier to peace and security on the northwestern border of the Soviet Union, but also become one of the most progressive pages in the Federal Republic." (TASS, 31st)</p>
<h3>Situation in the Balkans: Fierce Competition Among Countries, Military Developments Dependent on Politics</h3>
<p>The Balkan Entente countries (Turkey, Greece, Romania, Yugoslavia) recently held a meeting in the Yugoslav capital. A total of 200 well-known journalists went to cover the news, which shows the importance of the meeting. What this meeting decided will have to be proven by the facts, but some basic military issues can be studied now, which will be beneficial to the evolution of the situation in the Balkan Peninsula in the future.</p>
<p>Bulgaria and Hungary are not Balkan Entente countries. They both hold irredentist policies, especially against Romania. They have both been rearmed by Germany. The Soviet Union also has a strong influence in Bulgaria. Italian diplomacy is very active in both Hungary and Bulgaria. However, these two countries do not have any truly significant disputes with Yugoslavia. Hungary is geographically sufficient to protect Romania, preventing Germany from going south. Bulgaria can prevent Britain, France and Turkey from providing land assistance to Romania. Therefore, Bulgaria and Hungary occupy a pivotal position in the dangerous situation in the Balkan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Secondly, Italy's attitude must also be taken into account. The four battleships that the country has built may be completed this spring. At that time, the country's navy will become a more important element. When making decisions regarding the Mediterranean Sea, the countries concerned may need to weigh the pros and cons. This kind of navy is located on the transportation lines of the British, French, and Near Eastern troops and the allies of Britain and France (Turkey and Egypt), at least making it impossible for Britain and France to rest easy. This kind of navy of Italy greatly helps the country's policy and bargaining power. Italy's policy can be considered to be firmly opposed to the Soviet Union's expansion of power into the Balkan region, but it is not necessarily opposed to Germany.</p>
<p>Italy has a particularly strong influence in Yugoslavia. The country's coastline is under the control of the Italian fleet, and there are also two land borders with Italy, although these two borders are mountainous and difficult to pass. There are rumors that Italy, Yugoslavia, and Hungary have a joint military "understanding."</p>
<p>The Yugoslav army is well-trained and skillfully commanded, and can be called a strong force, but its modern equipment is insufficient. The country's terrain is rugged, far more so than Poland and Romania. It will not be easy for Germany to attack it. On the other hand, Yugoslavia would not dare to attack Germany rashly without a guarantee of rapid assistance. Although Yugoslav public opinion favors aiding Britain and France, there are many other issues to consider.</p>
<p>Among the Balkan countries, Romania is in the most dangerous situation. If Germany attacks through Hungary, or together with that country and the Soviet Union, Romania may be able to resist temporarily, but unless it receives foreign aid, long-term resistance is unlikely.</p>
<p>The assistance of Turkey and Britain and France can reach Romania from land through Bulgaria, or from the sea and air. Turkey may exert sufficient pressure on Bulgaria to allow this aid to pass through. At that time, it will be difficult for Germany to stand up for Bulgaria, and the Bulgarian army will not have the strength to fight Turkey. As for the Soviet Union's assistance to Bulgaria, it must pass through Romania, which is time-consuming and unstable. If the sea route is taken, the Turkish fleet can intercept it with the reinforcement of the British and French navies. The fighting power of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet may not be as strong as the Turkish fleet. It cannot guarantee the safety of Soviet reinforcements at sea, nor can it prevent Britain, France, and Turkey from taking the sea route to aid Romania. However, there are also difficulties on the side of Britain and France. Although the countries have sufficient transport ships, it takes a long time for Romanian reinforcements to land, and it takes even longer under air strikes.</p>
<p>The time factor is very important in the evolution of the situation in the Balkans. How Germany acts may depend on this. Because Germany will not easily try any military adventures in the Balkan Peninsula without the certainty of a quick victory. Quickly annexing Romania with 20 or 30 divisions is one thing, and fighting a long-term desperate battle with the joint forces of Turkey and Romania aided by the British and French Near East Army is another. If Germany disregards everything and engages in a long-term war in the Balkans, its strength will be greatly depleted, weakening its position on the Western Front. Germany has tried its best to avoid a long-term war in Poland, so it may not dare to fall into a similar vortex in Romania under more difficult circumstances. But one thing to note is that since the Soviet Union used troops against Poland, ending the Polish war early, why can't it take the same action against Romania?</p>
<p>A joint German-Soviet attack on Romania has all sorts of opportunities to gain a strong foothold in the Danube region before Turkey and Britain and France can send large troops to Romania. However, this attempt will inevitably arouse active hostility from Italy. From this point of view, the situation in the Balkan Peninsula is still chaotic and uneasy, depending on how various forces and interests are balanced and drawn together. The military factors in between need to be determined by how political adjustments are made. (Translated from the New York Herald Tribune)</p>

In addition, the first batch of children's welfare badges ordered by our association has been completely distributed to people from all walks of life. Yesterday, the drivers' mutual aid association and ticket sellers' public welfare association of the British-owned Public Bus Company also sent donations for the children's library and received thousands of children's welfare badges for commemoration.</p>
<p>Also, Da Guang She says that the Shanghai Special City Council of the China Boy Scouts issued a letter to all Boy Scouts in the city on Children's Day to encourage and commemorate them, briefly stating that we should have a deeper understanding of the current position of the nation and the country. Our nation is persevering in fighting to resist insults and seek survival, and our country is vigorously fighting to resist the war and survive. The final victory is already in sight. Only if each of us guards our posts, works hard from our positions, is unyielding, united in spirit, and united in mind and morality, and supports the national policy of resistance and reconstruction, can we complete the mission of revitalizing the nation. On this Children's Memorial Day, we hope that all Boy Scouts in our city will maintain our pure intentions and promote our sincere patriotic sentiments.</p>

<h3>Western Football Club Angered by Rejection of Chinese Team Protest: Not Only No Explanation Given, but Players Severely Penalized - A Laughingstock in Sports, a Stain on the International Cup</h3>
<p>In the list of penalties announced by the Western Football Club earlier this week, all those punished were Chinese, and the severity of the penalties set a new record for the season. Li Du, Meng Yangliang, and Jiang Zhaoxiang were all banned from playing in the remaining games of the season. Captain Sun Jinshun also received a very severe warning, and Jia Youliang of Donghua was also reprimanded. Those concerned about football were shocked upon hearing this but did not know the reasons for the penalties. Now it is learned that Meng and Jia were punished based on the China-Portugal final in the International Cup, and Jiang Zhaoxiang was punished for the consequences of being sent off during the Scoloto Cup final. As for the reasons for punishing Meng and Jia, they are extremely ridiculous. According to the written explanation sent by the Western Club, Sun Jinshun's offense is translated as "ungentlemanly conduct," referring to the fact that after referee Pantuo unfairly penalized the Chinese team with a fabricated penalty kick, Captain Sun Jinshun should not have protested on the spot, which incited the audience, led to accusations, and disrupted order on the field. As for Meng Yiliang, he did not receive any warnings from referee Pantuo during the International Cup, nor did he make any transgressions. In the referee's report after the game, there was no mention of Meng Yi deserving punishment, yet he received such a severe penalty. It is truly "wanting to condemn someone, one can always find a reason." As for Sun Jinshun, it is even more laughable, as he is the captain and has the responsibility to protest when the referee makes a mistake. The Western Club wants the captain to be silenced and then accuses him of inciting the audience and charges him with "ungentlemanly conduct." This is completely absurd. The motive for this penalty is purely the International Cup final. The players being punished are members of the Chinese team, and their affiliated clubs should not be listed in the penalty notice. If they must be listed, it should be clearly stated "Chinese team members." Regarding the delivery procedure of the penalty notice, the Western Club did not take appropriate measures. The Western League did not send the penalty notice to Mr. Shen Siliang, the person in charge of the Chinese team, or Li Baojun, the manager of the Chinese team, but directly sent it to the clubs to which the penalized players belonged, which was a case of mistaken identity. Therefore, it was returned by various clubs the next day, with the explanation that it was a "misdelivery." After the Chinese team protested the referee's dereliction of duty in the China-Portugal final of the International Cup, it was rejected by the Western League Executive Committee, and the reasons have not been made public. Instead, this penalty notice was issued, which shows the Western Club's bizarre actions.</p>

<h3>Finance: Rumors of Escalating European War Trigger Limited Foreign Exchange Buying</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. The unofficial British and American exchange markets have been unusually calm recently, with only small movements by speculators causing minor fluctuations in exchange rates. Therefore, the situation today was the same. Initially, due to a two-point increase in exchange rates, the US dollar opened lower by 0.0625 at 6.125 yuan, while the British pound remained unchanged. Subsequently, speculators sold heavily, but there were few buyers, leading to a decline. Futures prices all strengthened, and at one point, even the current month's 6 yuan US dollar was difficult to sell. Suddenly, the Banque de l'Indochine entered the market, aggressively buying (apparently from a certain party), and rumors spread that the European war was escalating, suggesting that exchange rates might fall again. This deterred sellers and instead spurred some operators to buy slightly, stabilizing the situation. By noon, the Banque de l'Indochine's willingness to buy had waned, and futures prices returned to their opening levels. The closing results were the same as the opening prices (with the combined British and American exchange rate at 3.56375 yuan), with the US dollar slightly firmer by 0.0625 compared to the previous day, while the British pound remained unchanged. The potential for futures differed slightly from the spot market.</p>
<p>Opening Saw Heavy Selling</p>
<p>In the morning, London's large cables fell by 1.875 for near-term and 2.5 for deferred. New York silver prices remained flat, and London gold was stable. Exchange rates for British pounds against US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The US dollar against the British pound continued to rise by one point, remained unchanged against Shanghai, and rose by 1.25 against the French franc. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with a spot selling price of 4 pence and 125 for the British pound and 6.125 yuan for the US dollar, with the British pound flat and the US dollar firmer by 0.0625 compared to the previous close due to the increase in exchange rates. At the same time, futures opened with the British pound flat and the US dollar weaker by 0.0625. After opening, speculators came to sell futures, slightly weakening the market. Transactions included selling the current month's US dollar at 6 yuan and the May US dollar at 5.84375 yuan to the Banque de l'Indochine. At that time, foreign banks were mutually trading the current month's British pound at 4 pence and 0.0625. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced at a slightly lower one point. Afterward, the market remained weak. It was difficult to find buyers for the current month's futures exchange rate of 6 yuan. However, the Banque de l'Indochine seized the opportunity to come back and buy, taking in the current month's US dollar at 6 yuan from a certain bank. At the same time, rumors suddenly spread that the European war was escalating, and exchange rates were expected to fall, causing sellers to decrease and instead attracting a few buyers. Speculators bought the May US dollar at 5.8125 yuan from a foreign bank, and money exchange businesses bought the current month's US dollar at 6 yuan from the China-Italy Bank. The Banque de l'Indochine also bought the spot US dollar at 6.125 yuan from an American bank. At noon, American banks gradually reduced their willingness to sell, and futures prices gradually returned to their opening levels. By the close, the British pound was at 4 pence and 125, the US dollar at 6.125 yuan, the current month's British pound at 4 pence and 0.03125, the US dollar at 5.96875 yuan, and the May British pound at 3 pence and 921875, the US dollar at 5.8125 yuan. Both current and futures prices were the same as the morning opening. As a result, the current British pound was flat and the US dollar firmer by 0.0625 compared to the previous day. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Weakened</p>
<p>A cable from Hong Kong on the 3rd (Wednesday) reported that the foreign exchange market opened flat this morning, with the British pound unchanged. The spot US dollar weakened by 0.1875 to 22.0625 yuan, and the deferred rate was not opened. The spot Shanghai exchange rate fell by one to 359 yuan. The spot Japanese exchange rate also increased by one yuan to 93.5 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market was flat, with no changes in any exchange rates. At 11:47 AM, the market was stable, with the spot Shanghai exchange rate rising by 0.5 yuan to 159.5 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Tianjin British Pound Unchanged</p>
<p>A cable from Tianjin on the 3rd (Wednesday) reported that the foreign exchange market opened firmer this morning, with the spot British pound and Shanghai exchange rate remaining unchanged. The spot US dollar weakened by 0.0625 to 5.8125 yuan, and the unofficial "Joint Note" rebounded by one yuan to 101.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Opens Weak, Quickly Rebounding</h3>
<p>Although the cash gold market was affected by the environment yesterday, sentiment remained strong, resulting in a small decline of only 27 yuan. The market initially opened weak due to the increase in exchange rates and the weakening of the US dollar, immediately dropping by 60 yuan. Many sellers focused their attention, seeming to be waiting for something. Subsequently, rumors spread that futures prices were slightly firmer, leading to more selling and another 10 yuan drop. However, gold shops and money exchange businesses suddenly bought aggressively, pulling the price up to 5,480 yuan. Banks and securities firms occasionally sold, causing the price to fall back to 5,445 yuan. At noon, foreign exchange futures prices returned to their opening levels, boosting market sentiment. As a result, buyers actively purchased, pushing prices up step by step, reaching a high of 5,492 yuan. The market closed at 5,483 yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon. Approximately 2,000 taels or more were traded in the morning session. Gold jewelry prices initially fell but rebounded, while customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Continues to Fall by 27 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning opening, when exchange rates were reported higher by two points and the US dollar was firm, market sentiment was weak, with widespread selling. The market opened with a 60 yuan drop, with securities firms selling 20 taels to banks at 5,450 yuan. Shortly after, money exchange businesses sold, and foreign exchange futures prices slightly weakened, causing another 10 yuan drop. Gold shops sold 30 taels to money exchange businesses at 5,440 yuan. Subsequently, cash gold shops bought in at the lower price, and banks also bought in slightly. Furthermore, a certain gold shop bought aggressively, and sellers were momentarily silent, causing the price to rebound by 40 yuan. Money exchange businesses mutually traded 50 taels at 5,480 yuan. Subsequently, a certain securities firm sold long positions, and a money exchange business also showed a strong intention to sell. Many retail investors also followed suit, causing the price to fall again by 35 yuan. Securities firms sold 50 taels to gold shops at 5,445 yuan. Afterward, gold shops came back to buy in, stabilizing the market and rebounding by more than 10 yuan. After 11:00 AM, certain money exchange businesses and banks aggressively bought in, and foreign exchange futures prices were reported to have returned to their opening levels, causing the price to continue to rise by more than 30 yuan. Banks bought 30 taels from gold shops at 5,492 yuan. Later, banks sold again, causing the price to fall by 9 yuan. Banks mutually traded 10 taels at 5,483 yuan, the afternoon closing price. As a result, the price continued to fall by 27 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fluctuated by 52 yuan and 10 cents during the morning session. The selling price of cash gold shops was several yuan higher than the "smelting red" price, while the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current standard gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, with little activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Prices Initially Fall, Then Rebound to Flat</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry in silver shops initially remained at 555 yuan per tael among the major players. By 9:30 AM, the price was lowered by 5 yuan. At 11:50 AM, the price rebounded by 5 yuan. There were no further changes afterward. As a result, the major players still maintained a price of 555 yuan, with new players offering the same price. The buying price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Bills Fluctuate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign bill market saw the supply of British and American gold pounds unchanged, and market prices continued to decline. The supply and demand of British gold bills remained balanced, and market prices remained stable. US dollar bills still fluctuated, eventually declining. The price initially fell to 16.31 yuan in the morning, and after opening, selling pressure increased, causing the price to fall to 16.23 yuan. The price rebounded after the fall, rising to 16.345 yuan. In the afternoon, the price declined again, eventually closing at 16.3 yuan. Hong Kong bills rose along with Hong Kong-Shanghai exchange rates. Annam bills continued to be in demand, and market prices continued to rise. Philippine bills remained weak. The demand for Japanese gold bills increased sharply, and prices rose sharply, reaching 1.325 yuan in the evening. Korean bills followed suit, rising to 1.045 yuan in the evening. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds each fall by 0.5 yuan, US dollar bills fall by 0.07 yuan, Hong Kong bills rise by 0.05 yuan, Annam bills rise by 0.03 yuan, Philippine bills fall by 0.05 yuan, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Falls by 4 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange-drawn bills rebounded and fell, initially trading at 69 yuan per thousand in the morning, rising to 71 yuan at one point, but soon falling back to 66 yuan. There were no changes in the afternoon, remaining at 66 yuan, 4 yuan lower than the previous day. The clearing rate for the Money Industry Association was reported at 0.2 yuan for both morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Securities: Shift in Focus to Active Government Bonds</h3>
<p>The securities market saw continued bullishness yesterday, with ample short-covering trades. Sentiment was generally positive, and rumors suggested that the financial sector was actively absorbing, which was within expectations given their current surplus. Furthermore, government bonds use exchange-drawn bills, which are not significantly correlated with tight or loose credit conditions. Consequently, some predicted that Category C bonds might break through the 50 yuan barrier. The most active buyers yesterday were De Fu, followed by Tian Sheng, Hong Da, Lian He Sheng Da, Mao Tai, Heng Fu, and Hu He Ji, all of whom saw considerable buying. The main sellers were Le Mao, along with Tong Kang, Tai Feng, Geng Xing, and retail investors, all of whom were selling. With demand exceeding supply, market prices rose by 0.12 to 0.4 yuan. Total turnover was approximately 1.3 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A	58.90	58.50	58.70	+0.30</p>
<p>Unified B	50.75	50.50	50.55	+0.15</p>
<p>Unified C	49.70	49.30	49.65	+0.40</p>
<p>Unified D	48.55	48.20	48.55	+0.40</p>
<p>Unified E	49.70	49.35	49.60	+0.35</p>
<p>For stock trading, 50 shares of China Trust were traded at a price of 10 yuan each. Due to residual selling pressure from the previous day, the stock market's opening trend was not strong. However, as buyers found it difficult to obtain desired shares at lower prices, they frequently increased their bids. The closing demand for all shares was good, and the market recovered strongly, washing away the sluggish atmosphere. Shanghai Silver, Jardine Matheson, and Public Motors shares, in particular, showed improvement.</p>
<p>China Coal Development shares were disappointing due to the company's recent announcement of only 60 cents of dividends for the end of the previous period. The opening price declined, reaching a low of 14 yuan. However, some realized that the dividend (including the previous dividend, totaling 1.2 yuan) was nominally for the entire year but was actually the operating profit after only half a year of work (as the company's mines were almost entirely consumed by mechanical equipment in the first few months of 1930 and were then hindered by heavy rain in the autumn). Consequently, prices rebounded, and buyers were present at 14.5 yuan at the close.</p>
<p>Rubber shares saw strong demand, with the Langkat share being particularly active due to rumors that it would announce excellent dividends.</p>
<p>The 21st Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of China Coal Development Co., Ltd. (Mentougou Coal Mine), managed by the British firm McBain &amp; Co., will be held on April 26th. The final dividend for 1939 is proposed to be 60 cents, bringing the total dividend for the year to 1.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the British firm Hong Kong Security Insurance Co., Ltd. will be held in Hong Kong on May 3rd. The final dividend for 1939 is proposed to be 12 shillings and 6 pence.</p>
<p>The British firm Shanghai Enterprise Co., Ltd. recently decided at a board meeting to pay a dividend of 20 cents per share for 1939, with a remaining balance of over 10,000 yuan to be carried forward to the next period.</p>
<p>A cable from London on the 2nd (Tuesday) reported that the listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British Far East company stocks were stable today, and there were no changes in market prices.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Market Slightly Weakens</h3>
<p>After a sharp decline and subsequent rebound, the rice market has been fluctuating. No. 1 Saigon rice has generally hovered around 44 to 45 yuan. Although it briefly reached a high of 46.5 yuan, it fell as soon as it rose. Yesterday, rumors spread in the market that the interior areas such as Jingwu, Changxi, and Sujia were about to be opened up and cleared for traffic to Shanghai, causing merchants to hesitate to engage in rash actions. Floating hoarders urgently sought to sell quickly, causing prices to fall by nearly one yuan. The downward trend intensified, and prices fell successively throughout the morning market, falling by about two yuan. No. 1 Saigon rice was only selling for 44 to 44.5 yuan, while meter-luh rice fell by about one yuan due to the smaller amount of goods available. Broken rice opened at 36 yuan, dropping to a low of 35 yuan, while meter-luh rice dropped from 37.5 yuan to 37 yuan, prompting bargain hunting. Prices briefly rebounded by 0.3 to 0.5 yuan. However, sentiment was weak, and the rebound was short-lived. As a result, the prices of various foreign rice varieties fell by 1 to 2 yuan compared to the previous market. Although there was a large amount of glutinous rice available, the prices were close to those of broken rice due to repeated price drops, reaching a bottom, attracting inquiries. Sellers were unwilling to lower prices further, so prices remained stable with little change. Large and thin japonica rice and early and late indica rice saw increased activity in transit from Hongkou, with no fewer than 4,000 to 5,000 bags traded. In the unofficial market, it was reported that most cargo owners sought to quickly sell off their stocks, also lowering prices by more than one yuan. Kunshan japonica rice was priced at 45 to 46 yuan, medium rice at 44 yuan, special thin indica rice at 44 to 45 yuan, medium rice at 43 yuan, and Nanxiang early and late indica rice at 42 to 43 yuan, down to 41 yuan, etc.</p>
<p>Another large shipment of foreign rice arrived, transported directly from Saigon by the Wah Lun Shipping Company's Da Pu Lun, totaling 29,150 bags, arriving at the port around 6 PM on the 2nd (previous day), berthing at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou, and unloading operations commenced yesterday morning. The Italian ship Meng Tuo Pi Ana also transported a large amount of foreign rice from Saigon, expected to arrive tomorrow. The exact amount will be reported later.</p>
<p>The morning opening prices for foreign rice saw a sharp decline, as a large number of recent orders had arrived in Shanghai and were being sold off by Japanese merchants, further weakening sentiment. Spot foreign rice prices fell sharply by 2 yuan in the early market, but the market saw a slight improvement in actual sales, rebounding by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. However, sentiment remained weak, and futures prices also saw a sharp decline. April No. 1 Saigon rice was priced at 52 yuan, and No. 2 at 49.5 yuan, immediately dropping to 49 yuan with few buyers, or even 48.6 yuan for April delivery, or even 48.2 yuan for immediate delivery. Xiaojiao (short-grained) rice was as low as 48.5 yuan, and April Xiaojiao was as low as 49 yuan, falling by 1.5 to 1 yuan compared to the previous day's high price. Total futures volume was 375 tons, and spot rice volume was 4,500 bags.</p>
<p>In other news, it was recently learned that the "Da Chang Company" organization mentioned in a previous report has been formally established, with Mr. Yu as the organizer and most participants being well-funded grain merchants. It is the first time such a large capital has been used to operate in the grain business, and it is possible that it will control the city's food supply in the future. According to Mr. Fu, a leader in the rice industry, the production and sales cooperation issue being discussed by the concession authorities and the social affairs office is unrelated to this matter, as the former is private and the latter is for the welfare of the residents of the concession. (End)</p>
<h3>Flour Trading Slightly Active, Wheat Remains Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour trading was slightly more active than before, with slight activity from local and inland merchants, as well as some involvement from merchant groups. However, the market saw increased supply, likely due to the 1 to 2 yuan drop in rice prices and the current dumping of miscellaneous Japanese brand flour in the market. Reportedly, the initial asking price for returned goods of the old Che brand was equal to the factory price, but the market price was only 13.72 yuan in the morning, a slight decrease from the previous day. However, green cannon car goods still required 15 yuan, Tianzhu brand also required 14 yuan, and Youlu brand required 13 yuan. Total transaction volume was estimated at 4,000 to 5,000 bags throughout the day. Local retail sales from factories were approximately 7,000 to 8,000 bags. It is estimated that 6,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin today (4th).</p>
<p>Wheat trading was very limited yesterday, and the market remained sluggish. Recently, domestic factories need to mix foreign wheat with local wheat, so their demand has not been low. However, they are still unwilling to raise prices, while those holding wheat are still unwilling to lower prices. As a result, Fuxin Factory purchased 1,000 bags of Changxi wheat at a price of 23.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans See Little Progress</h3>
<p>The sales of soybeans were limited yesterday, and the overall situation was slow and stagnant. The market price for high-quality soybeans was stable, and the upper-middle-grade goods from the oil pressing factory and storage owners were selling. Local merchants inquired about the lower-grade goods. A total of 110 bags of Nanjing soybeans were sold at a price of 18.5 yuan, over 600 bags of Wuhu soybeans were sold at a price ranging from 20 yuan to 21.2 yuan, 5 carloads of Bengbu soybeans were sold at a price of 22.7 yuan and 22.5 yuan, 1 carload of Yangzhou Shanhuang was sold at a price of 19 yuan, over 100 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans were sold at a price of 22 yuan, and 100 bags of Dalian mixed green soybeans were sold at a price of 20.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Southwest Yarn Continues Unabated</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rebounded, resulting in no significant changes from the previous day. However, sentiment remained enthusiastic, as Southwest China continued to demand Chinese yarn, so buyers actively absorbed 20-count Double Horse yarn, causing prices to rise as soon as they fell. However, foreign exchange rates have increased, and the overseas cotton market has weakened, with Indian cotton prices falling sharply, resulting in lower conversion prices. Considering the recent smooth operations of factories and the purchase of forward Indian cotton for forward yarn production, significant profits can be expected.</p>
<p>The morning opening of spot yarn saw continued increases in British and American exchange rates and sharp declines in Indian cotton, with relatively calm sentiment. The April price for 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,125 yuan. Subsequently, due to the decline in gold prices and the weakness of the US dollar, selling pressure increased slightly, causing the price to fall to 1,115 yuan. However, buyers returned to the market at the lower price, and the market slowly rebounded, rising to 1,145 yuan at the close. Afterwards, the market slightly weakened. The total transaction volume for the morning session was 2,610 bales. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 10 yuan. Shenxin Factory sold 1,500 bales of 20-count Double Horse yarn at prices ranging from 1,050 yuan to 1,065 yuan, and 150 bales of 32-count Double Horse yarn at a price of 1,455 yuan, all purchased by Cantonese merchants. 115 items were shipped to Tianjin on the 4th, and 145 items were shipped to Yantai. The purchase amounts by various merchant groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Local: 1,900; Hong Kong: 655; Inland: 55; Total: 2,610</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Falling Sharply, Local Cotton Trading Still Quiet</h3>
<p>Local cotton trading was still quiet. There were some mutual purchases and sales of foreign cotton among local merchants, but market demand was very weak, as the trend of foreign cotton continued to decline, and the price of Indian cotton was falling sharply, resulting in lower conversion prices. More than 500 bales of Supai sourced from Northern Jiangsu arrived. The current cotton transaction situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Mitterlin: 272.00 - 100 items purchased by local merchants</p>
<p>Also: 275.50 - 200 items purchased by local merchants</p>
<p>Oomra: 207.00 - 100 items purchased by local merchants</p>
<p>Bhiloch: 218.00 - 300 items purchased by Shenxin Factory</p>
<p>American Seed: 208.00 - 156 bales purchased by local merchants</p>
<p>Northern Thai: 205.00 - 300 bales purchased by local merchants</p>
<p>Lumiline: 270.00 - 100 items purchased by local merchants</p>
<p>In other news, the New York cotton market was weak again this morning, as the Liverpool telegraph reported a decline and the Mumbai telegraph reported another decline, causing great market anxiety. Also, some long positions were liquidated in the market, resulting in closing prices that were 6 to 7 pounds lower compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including high-efficiency, also fell by 7 rupees. The Egyptian market was closed.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trading was weak due to the continued decline in the Indian cotton market, even though yarn prices continued to rise. Indian cotton previously ordered by merchants has now become high-priced. Also, as exchange rates slightly increased yesterday, various parties were eager to sell. However, factory purchases remained weak. The factory delivery prices, converted at a US exchange rate of 6.125, are listed below:</p>
<p>20-count: American Mitterlin 283.25</p>
<p>20-count: Also, Lower Grade 271.00</p>
<p>32-count: Also 299.20</p>
<p>32-count: Also, Lower Grade 288.70</p>
<p>42-count: Also 302.70</p>
<p>42-count: Also, Lower Grade 292.50</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New York Silk Prices Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign silk market in New York fell (Yokohama closed for a holiday). New York's near-term price fell by 0.19 yuan, and the deferred price fell by 0.22 yuan. There were no replies to telegrams sent from Shanghai the previous day. New artificial silk products have appeared in the New York market, and the patriotic American people will likely reduce their affection for genuine silk, so silk prices may continue to weaken in the near future.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>According to a telegram from the Netherlands yesterday, sugar prices slightly declined by 0.1 yuan. The C.I.F.K.G. price for coarse white sugar was 8.65 Dutch guilders, causing the trend in the local market to weaken. The current price for coarse white sugar was 62.5 yuan for goods stored in Shanghai warehouses, down by 0.5 yuan; the price for newly arrived goods stored in foreign warehouses was 62.1 to 62.2 yuan, down by 0.8 yuan; and the price for old goods was 61.8 yuan, down by 0.6 yuan. Re-exported goods were 48.4 yuan, also down by 0.6 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar prices were slightly lower by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The B mark on the west line was 68.8 yuan, the CW mark was 68.3 yuan, the CX mark was 67.8 yuan, the DY mark was 67.2 yuan, and the HX mark was 67 yuan. Goods stored in eastern warehouses were discounted. H mark military-use sugar was 49 yuan for new goods, 48 yuan for old goods, and 47 yuan for oil-packed goods. Dutch red sugar WA mark was 52 yuan, and re-exported sugar was 44 yuan. Local crystal sugar No. 1 was 74.5 yuan, No. 2 was 74 yuan, Crystal Bright Ice was 76 yuan, and Snow White was 62 yuan, all down by 0.5 yuan. For domestic sugar, only Guang Bang offered 82 packages of Xuanzhou ocean sugar at 56 yuan and 70 boxes of Qing sugar at 39 yuan.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods: High Price of Hanshang Celestial Rice</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's dispatch from Hankou, Celestial Rice is extremely expensive, with Celestial Rice priced at 320 yuan and Celestial Rice flakes at 520 yuan.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Election: The British-American Front is Extremely Solid; Japanese Empty Threats Are of No Use; Those Who Have Not Paid Their Taxes Cannot Vote; The Mainland News Urges Foreign Voters to Rise Up in Unity</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side requested the Municipal Council to increase the number of Japanese directors, the Municipal Council has not agreed because the Land Regulations cannot be changed. The Japanese side has gone ahead and nominated as many as five Japanese candidates, intending to forcibly break the "gentleman's agreement" of five British, two American, and two Japanese directors and have the same number of directors as the British, thereby controlling the administration of the concession. In order to resist the Japanese intention, British and American taxpayers, in addition to adopting a united front with electors from other European and American communities to ensure that the British and American elected candidates receive more votes than the Japanese elected candidates, will also increase the number of British candidates by one. All parties, including the British, American, and Japanese sides, are working hard on the election campaign. The Japanese side is clamoring, even saying that the British side's increase of one candidate is an act of provocation. It can be said that the conflict of interest between the British and Japanese sides is the most intense. The Japanese semi-official organ, the Mainland News, even used threatening words against the Public Concession in yesterday's editorial, saying that if this election does not achieve its goal, the Japanese army will take action within the possible range. It also said that all groups that prevent the Japanese from making this progress should be prepared to take full responsibility for the consequences. It can be said that they are using every possible means, and the seriousness and tension of the situation can be imagined. The developments of yesterday are recorded below,</p>
<p>Japanese Threats and Inducements to Jews</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Municipal Council election is about to be held. Japanese lobbyists are now using "permission for relatives of Jewish immigrants to enter Shanghai" as bait to induce European Jews on the north bank of Suzhou Creek to elect five Japanese candidates. The Japanese have already set up a campaign office on Zhao Feng Road, with two Japanese and four Jewish refugees from Germany assisting in the work, doing their best to win the minority electorate in order to increase the number of Japanese directors on the Municipal Council to five.</p>
<p>British and American Residents Do Not Vote for Japanese</p>
<p>However, most of the German-Jewish residents with voting rights live on the south bank of Suzhou Creek and are not tempted by Japanese pressure. Only half of the German residents in Shanghai with voting rights are National Socialist Party members. In previous years, most of the British and American residents with voting rights elected British, American, and Japanese candidates. However, this year, the British resident Zhu Bifu elected the Japanese and will elect five British candidates and the extra candidate McDonald, as well as two American candidates. Therefore, it is even possible to reduce the number of Japanese directors to one.</p>
<p>Paying Taxes is Required to Vote</p>
<p>As for the voting time, it will be held on the 10th and 11th from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM at the Shanghai Volunteer Corps drill hall and the Hongkou Small Vegetable Market, as usual. Currently, British, American, and Japanese residents are very active, vying for the electorate of minorities and inquiring whether taxpayers of their own nationality have paid their taxes, because taxpayers who have not paid their taxes will not be able to obtain the voting certificate necessary to go to the polling place. It is heard that the ballot counters who open the ballot boxes and count the votes can freely obtain several assistants to assist in the counting, because the election ballots are not counted by Municipal Council officials.</p>
<p>The Japanese Attitude is Very Arrogant</p>
<p>The Japanese semi-official organ, the Mainland News, even issued a threat to the Public Concession in yesterday's editorial, saying, "If the Japanese side cannot obtain a greater representation in the Municipal Council this time, the Japanese army will take action within the possible range to obtain control of the Public Concession. If such a 'reasonable' demand of the Japanese is unfortunately despised by the Western residents, and the 'dictatorship' of the British over the concession continues, then the Japanese side will abandon its 'legal procedure' and replace it with other means. If the situation after this is as described above, the situation in the concession will return to a state of chaos." The newspaper also warned various groups, saying, "All groups that prevent the Japanese from making this progress should be prepared to take full responsibility for the consequences." The newspaper further stated, "When the issue of the Public Concession was discussed last year, some people accused the Public Concession of being a base for the 'anti-Japanese movement' and suggested that the Japanese should resolve the issue of the concession with force, making it a part of the Japanese military's jurisdiction. But to our knowledge, the result of the concession issue has already been resolved 'legally,' because the cross-border road construction police agreement and the Hongkou district agreement have already been signed by both sides."</p>
<p>The Current Situation Cannot Be Estimated</p>
<p>According to foreign observations, the Japanese suddenly announcing that the number of candidates has increased to as many as five this time will shake the foundations of the Public Concession, which have never changed in the past seventy years. In the past decade, the proportion of five British, two American, and two Japanese directors on the Public Concession Municipal Council will shake for the first time. If the Japanese side achieves its goal this time, the British and Americans will only get the remaining four seats. In comparison, although the British influence is stronger than the American influence, it is currently impossible for the general public to predict how the distribution will be.</p>
<p>German and Russian Residents are of Utmost Importance</p>
<p>Among the foreign groups that are most important in this election are the German and Russian residents in Shanghai. There are about 700 German taxpayers, including Germans and German-Jewish refugees. Most of the German-Jewish refugees live in the northern district of Suzhou Creek, which is controlled by the Japanese. Regardless of whether the Germans fully support the British and American candidates, it is estimated that at least 400 Jewish refugees will vote for the Japanese candidates. As mentioned above, the attitude of the 450 Russian taxpayers in this port, whether they live south or north of the bridge, can be known. In addition, there are 100 Germans and 100 Portuguese living in the Public Concession, who may support the British and American side, but the 90 Italian residents and 12 Spanish residents are afraid that they will support the Japanese because of the so-called "Anti-Comintern Pact." The 24 Dutch residents and about 300 residents from other countries may support the British and American side. Based on the estimated number of votes that both sides can win, if all voters can maintain 85 percent of the votes being valid (excluding Germans and Russians), the British and American side can obtain an equal number of votes with the Japanese. Yesterday, according to reliable sources, it was claimed that the Japanese will intensify their protests against the matter of fighting for votes before the election, but they believe that if the Japanese have indeed done so, the Japanese residents in the northern district of the bridge must first pay the taxes they owe.</p>
<p>British Candidate Declares His Attitude</p>
<p>The British independent candidate, Shanghai's famous lawyer, Reynolds MacDonald, made a statement to Western reporters yesterday, saying, "I am a British candidate, but not one of the five. I am a 'superman,' but if I am elected in this election, I would be very willing to call myself a 'Shanghaier.' The reason why I call myself 'transcendent' is because I do not belong to any one side or any one group, so I do not want to be a 'servant' of any one side or one group. I am willing to serve the entire Shanghai society and am willing to fight with unwavering spirit to win the happiness of all citizens, regardless of their nationality. I am a democrat and believe that there should be a democratic administrative body in Shanghai. I am willing to represent a government that is completely 'of the people, by the people, and for the people.' I am willing to make the affairs of the Municipal Council completely open, wash away the accumulated bad habits, and make the citizens feel that there are no dark corners in the various systems of the Municipal Council. I am willing to completely change the current situation, especially to improve the unequal land regulations. If I am elected, I will fight for the most possible economic savings methods until the economic situation of the Public Concession is on a sound foundation." According to reports, the Japanese candidates have long expressed their firm opposition to the Municipal Council's proposed increase of 50 percent in municipal rates. The resolution of this matter will probably be decided at the Western Taxpayers' Annual Meeting to be held on the 17th of this month, but the Japanese side has not yet expressed any specific methods.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals Unite</h3>
<p>This Election Is Extremely Important</p>
<p>The Ta Lu Bao (Mainland News) yesterday published an editorial titled "The Position of the Shanghai International Settlement," stating that the Japanese Residents Election Committee has nominated five candidates to run for seats on the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC). This action has made the issue of this year's election concrete. The only question to be decided in the election on the 10th and 11th of this month is whether the political status and international character of the Shanghai International Settlement will be changed.</p>
<p>Continuous Provocation Without End</p>
<p>Since August 1937, the Japanese have been exerting various pressures on the International Settlement, using their military force to threaten the neutrality and security of the Settlement, constantly exploiting oppressive diplomacy to undermine the Settlement's sovereignty and internationality, and encouraged by illegal actions, they have repeatedly challenged the ability of the SMC to govern its jurisdiction. This election is their latest provocation, which must be met and defeated by the ratepayers of the International Settlement alone.</p>
<p>Striving Through Own Election Campaign</p>
<p>The Japanese side's current election campaign is vastly different from their past attempts to control the International Settlement. It cannot be prevented by the diplomatic actions of third countries. Therefore, the ratepayers of the International Settlement must not rely on foreign assistance but fight in the upcoming election. If the International Settlement and non-Japanese foreign residents lose in this election challenge from the Japanese, it will not be because the British and American governments are unwilling to help the SMC, nor will it be due to the much-criticized appeasement policy of the SMC, but rather it will be entirely the fault of the muddleheadedness of the foreign ratepayers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>British and American Governments Cannot Help</p>
<p>In the past, when residents of this city fought against external forces, they always relied too much on the actions of third countries with interests in the International Settlement. When the Japanese sought to control the International Settlement through threats, diplomatic pressure, and military force, the ratepayers remained calm, hoping for action from Washington and London, believing that the British and American governments would surely rescue Shanghai from its troubles. However, the current situation is different. Although Britain and America are willing to protect the International Settlement, they cannot help shift the outcome of the vote on the 10th and 11th of this month. If non-Japanese foreign residents abstain from voting or fail to cast the full amount of votes necessary to defeat the Japanese, then the Japanese in Shanghai will legally have the right to control the International Settlement, and the SMC board will also become a Japanese group.</p>
<p>Japanese Statements Deserve Attention</p>
<p>The election platform announced by Hayashi Yuukichi, Chairman of the Japanese Residents Election Committee, deserves the attention of the city's ratepayers. Hayashi stated, "The purpose of the Japanese is to eliminate the monopoly of municipal affairs by any particular group of foreigners, so that the administration of the International Settlement can be conducted in a truly international state." This kind of election platform, expressed in diplomatic language, reveals its true meaning at a glance: the Japanese aim to eliminate the current monopoly system and replace it with a Japanese monopoly, and to change the current international character into a purely Japanese administrative organization.</p>
<p>Foreign Voters Must Rise Up Together</p>
<p>From the perspective of Shanghai's future, the importance of the election on the 10th and 11th of this month cannot be overstated. Whether the International Settlement becomes a suburb of Tokyo will depend on the outcome of the election. Whether the city's foreign residents will continue to be managed by themselves or ruled by the Japanese municipal authorities will depend on the voting ability of the non-Japanese foreign residents. As mentioned above, these issues are not decided in Washington or London, but determined by the voters of the International Settlement. The difference between maintaining the international status of the International Settlement and the Japanization of Shanghai depends entirely on whether the voters will cast their votes.</p>
<h3>The SMC Spends 5,000 Taels of Gold on Decorating the Director-General's Office; Western Staff Are Dismissed and Replaced by Jews</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that while the SMC seeks to economize by dismissing Western staff, it has now spent 5,000 yuan to decorate the Director-General's office. This is the second time 5,000 yuan has been spent on decorating Mr. Stirling Fessenden's office within a year, as the office was also renovated when Fessenden retired. In addition, Mr. Cale, head of the Parks and Open Spaces Department of the Public Works Department, who has served the SMC for 17 years, recently received a dismissal notice and left his post on the 31st of last month, to be replaced by European immigrants hired by the SMC at low wages. Furthermore, four Jewish immigrants, who entered the Public Works Department's automobile factory six months ago to study under motor engineer Mr. White, now Mr. White has also</p>
<h3>Taiping in Anhui Suffers Horrific Bombing by Japanese Aircraft; News Received in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that news has been received in Shanghai that from 8:00 AM on the 19th of last month, Japanese aircraft bombed Taiping in Anhui for four consecutive hours until noon, destroying houses and causing many civilian casualties. The buildings of the American mission in the area were also destroyed, and the caretaker was killed. Taiping is located on the highway from Tunxi to Guichi in southern Anhui. Although it is not far from the war zone, it has never been threatened by modern warfare. The Japanese-occupied Xuancheng is the closest to the area, but the Japanese army is advancing along the south bank of the Yangtze River, attempting to seize Qingyang in order to drive away the mobile artillery units bombarding Japanese warships. The bombing of Taiping on March 19th is likely a scene from a new military operation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Natives in Shanghai Organize to Relieve the Rice Shortage in Sanbei</h3>
<p>Ningbo natives in Shanghai initiated the organization of the Sanbei Ningbo Native Relief Committee to raise funds to provide food for their hometowns. They plan to raise funds to purchase rice and sell it at reasonable prices. After the first meeting, 50 committee members were selected, stipulating that each person must raise at least 2,000 yuan. Yu Qiaqing was elected as the chairman, and Shen Weiting and Fan Chufeng were elected as vice-chairmen. The commander of the fundraising team is Yu Qiaqing, with five vice-commanders. Five economic committee members were appointed, and donation collection points were designated as: (1) Shipping Association, (2) Tobacco Exchange Association, (3) Huacheng Company, (4) Dacheng Company, (5) Ji Ji Tobacco Shop. The fundraising period is limited to one month starting immediately. The meeting place was decided to be at the Ningbo Road Tobacco Exchange Association. They plan to purchase 20,000 bags of Saigon rice and resolved to ask Yu Qiaqing to arrange for telegraphic purchase. It was decided that Yu Qiaqing would temporarily advance 100,000 yuan for the rice purchase.</p>
<h3>Company Commander Executed for Ineffective Resistance; Six Deputies Shot Dead</h3>
<p>Gu Fusheng, commander of the Qingpu County Guerrilla Force and commander of the Third Detachment, has reportedly received secret information that Zhang Taosheng, company commander of the Third Company under his command, along with deputy Zhu Xilin, district commander Xu Xiaomei, platoon leader Xi Adi, and orderly Zhang Shunsheng, a total of seven people, were stationed on the Qinghu Road but had failed to achieve any results. Moreover, they had recently been ineffective in resisting the enemy. Commander Gu was furious upon receiving the report and summoned Zhang Taosheng and the other seven to headquarters for a reprimand. Consequently, the company commander Zhang Taosheng was executed by beheading at Wangjiatang the night before, and the remaining six, including deputy Zhu Xilin, were all executed by firing squad as a warning.</p>
<h3>Increased Taxes Are Difficult to Recover; The Hotel Industry Increases Prices; Water, Electricity, and Fuel Costs Increase Simultaneously; A Temporary Increase of 40% Starting This Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement is scheduled to increase license taxes for the hotel business starting April 1st. The Hotel Industry Association believes that if taxes are increased again at a time of rising prices, it will be impossible to operate. They have sent separate letters to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement and entertained all the Chinese directors, asking the SMC to withdraw the order or reduce the tax amount. Although the Bureau briefly considered reviewing the files, a reporter from Xin Sheng She (New Voice News Agency) learned that the Hotel Industry Association received news from the Chinese directors yesterday that it is difficult to withdraw the order for the tax increase. If they wait for the situation to change and the hotel business to be light, they will reduce the tax amount to ease the burden on taxpayers. The Hotel Industry Association stated that it would be difficult to protest this measure by the SMC again. Therefore, some large and small hotels have officially announced price increases. Their notice states: "To whom it may concern, the prices of fuel, water, and electricity in Shanghai are soaring endlessly. In addition, there has recently been an increase in hotel taxes. Therefore, we will temporarily add 40% to the original price starting April 1st as a compensation. We hereby announce this and hope for your understanding."</p>

<h3>Current Rice Prices Are Still Difficult to Bear; Discuss Continuing to Run Grain Shops; There Is Talk of Lifting the Ban on Domestic Rice Being Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the two settlements, the Soybean Industry Association, the Rice Industry Tea Party Market, and others have been paying close attention to the attempts of speculators to manipulate the rice market and raise rice prices, the rice market has become slightly more stable yesterday. In addition, after the Rice Industry Tea Party Market opened yesterday, it was rumored that a large amount of domestic rice would be transported to Shanghai, so the prices of various types of rice fell by one to two yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). The reason why the Japanese puppet government previously blocked the transportation of domestic rice to Shanghai was to threaten the residents of the settlements, but fortunately, a large amount of foreign rice was supplied, which did not fulfill their wish. Moreover, blocking the transportation of domestic rice and tax revenue has greatly hindered them, so there is talk of lifting the ban on domestic rice to increase tax revenue.</p>
<p>Continuing to Run Grain Shops Is Urgently Awaiting Discussion</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pingjiao (Fair Price) Committee announced: "Since the establishment of this committee, three months have passed in a blink of an eye. In the midst of all difficulties, we have maintained the livelihoods of ordinary people, and they have been able to obtain food without difficulty. All this is due to the cooperation of our colleagues. Although we have done our duty, we cannot boast about it. However, we can be happy that we have acted tirelessly. Now that the third phase of the grain sales is about to expire on April 7th, our comrades have worked hard together and are deeply exhausted, and the donations we have received are also coming to an end. We have temporarily planned to stop selling grain and make a small conclusion. However, after investigating the price of rice, it is difficult to enable ordinary people to afford it immediately, and the facts are clear to all. In this case, it is not appropriate to interrupt the matter, otherwise it will be incomplete. Regardless of whether it is ridiculed, can we be at peace with ourselves? Poverty still exists, and a gentleman does not abandon the old. Whether to continue the grain sales is urgently in need of consultation. We have scheduled a general committee meeting to be held at the Shipping Club on the fourth floor of 93 Guangdong Road at 2:00 PM on April 6th (Saturday) to discuss the matter."</p>
<h3>The Pseudo "Central Market" Is Again Controlling the Transportation of Local Goods; The Number of Seized Local Goods Has Gradually Increased; The Branch Market in Western Shanghai Will Also Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The pseudo "Central Market" and the two branch "markets" in Baiteli Nan Road and Nanshi in western Shanghai were originally scheduled to open simultaneously the day before yesterday. However, due to insufficient distribution of seized goods, only the "Central Market" opened. Now the seizure of local goods has gradually increased, so the Baiteli Nan Road branch "market" has decided to open tomorrow. As for the Nanshi branch "market", the opening plan has been postponed indefinitely. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Knowing That It Is Onerous, Precautions Are Strict</p>
<p>After the pseudo "Central Market" was established, it stepped up the interception of local goods transported to Shanghai, resulting in a gradual scarcity of local goods sources in the market, except for those secretly transported to Shanghai by villagers. Merchants had no choice but to purchase local goods from the "market", and use coolies to go to the "market" to transport them back. However, the "market" clearly knows that it is exploiting the common people, so it is extremely careful in its precautions. It stipulates that vendors who purchase goods must obtain an "entry and exit permit" before they can enter and exit, but the coolies hired by general local goods merchants do not have this "permit". Fearing accidents, it notified the local goods merchants yesterday and posted a notice in front of the gate that from now on, all coolies from outside are strictly prohibited from entering.</p>
<p>Even Transportation Vehicles Are Package-Dealt</p>
<p>Since the "market" controlled the local goods in the city, knowing that general local goods merchants would be forced to purchase from the "market", the trucking business must be prosperous. Therefore, the "market" gathered more than a dozen transport trucks and organized a "Central Transport Company" to control the transportation of local goods throughout the city. However, the "company" found that many local goods merchants hired their own vehicles to directly enter the "market" for loading and transportation, which affected its business. Therefore, it posted a notice yesterday that in the future, local goods merchants who want to hire transport trucks and workers to transport local goods must contact the "company", otherwise they will not be allowed to enter. The livelihoods of the city's transportation industry and general workers are also suffering from its attack.</p>
<p>The Branch "Market" in Western Shanghai Will Open Tomorrow</p>
<p>The pseudo "Central Market Branch Market" on Baiteli Nan Road in western Shanghai was originally scheduled to open on the same day as the "Central Market". However, because there were not many local goods seized at that time, if one place opened at the same time, it would not be enough to distribute. Therefore, only the "Central Market" opened first. Now that the Japanese puppet government has stepped up its interception in the suburbs, the seizure of local goods has gradually increased. Therefore, the Baiteli Nan Road branch "market" has decided to officially open tomorrow. As for the Nanshi branch "market", although it has repeatedly requested the French Concession authorities to open the iron gates of the 16th Pier, there has been no result, so the opening plan has been postponed indefinitely.</p>
<h3>British Ships Reduce Sailings in the Lower Yangtze River; Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire Reduce Schedules; Chinese Ships Forced to Fly the Japanese Flag</h3>
<p>Since Japanese shipping companies joined the Lower Yangtze River route, passenger and cargo traffic has been completely controlled, causing foreign shipping companies to have no cargo to load. Several ships have changed to other routes one after another. It has been learned that since the Sino-Japanese war, the Jiangyin River surface has been blocked, so the British companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire have changed to the Lower Yangtze River. The original four ships, Tonghe, Yihe, Wuhu, and Datong, have recently been changed to fly the Japanese flag by the Japanese, and all passenger and cargo traffic in various ports is monopolized by their ships. Moreover, the two major cargo transports, cotton and grain, cannot be exported, so the shipping business is greatly affected. Now the two companies' ships, Tonghe and Wulin, are changed to run one ship per week for rotation, so as to merely embellish shipping rights.</p>
<h3>A Kidnapping Occurred in the French Concession Last Night; The Kidnapped Person Was Ge Liquan From Taizhou; The Owner of a Tobacco Shop Was Injured by a Stray Bullet</h3>
<p>At 9:40 last night, a kidnapping of a Taizhou merchant occurred on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession. At that time, it was detected by the local patrolman, and the two sides exchanged fire. As a result, the merchant was eventually taken away, and a stray bullet injured the owner of a tobacco shop. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Private Lodging</p>
<p>Ge Liquan, a native of Taizhou, 45 years old, resides at No. 3 Luban Lane, Luban Road, French Concession, Shanghai. The residence is attached with the "Taizhou Bang Shipping Merchants' Shanghai Office". Ge suddenly rented Room 218 on the second floor of the Xinxinxiangji Inn at No. 114 Zhengjia Muqiao Street on November 1st of last year, carrying a young woman and a young man. According to Ge, the young woman is his wife, and the young man is his nephew.</p>
<p>A Sudden Arrival of Four People</p>
<p>At around 9:30 last night, a person resembling a certain foreigner led three Chinese men in Western suits, riding in a private car, directly to the entrance of the Xinxinxiangji Inn. After the four got out of the car, one with a figure eight mustache and a dark complexion was left at the entrance to keep watch, while the remaining three rushed in, went straight to the second floor, and broke into Room 218. At that time, Ge was chatting with his wife and nephew in the room. As soon as the three saw Ge, two of them took out handguns and prohibited them from making a sound.</p>
<p>Ge Was Taken Away</p>
<p>At that time, Ge knew that it was difficult to resist, and was dragged out of the room by the three. When they reached the stairs on the second floor, the three pushed Ge down the stairs. At that time, Ge fainted and fell to the ground. The three followed down the stairs and, together with the person standing at the entrance to keep watch, lifted Ge up, squeezed him into the car that the bandits had ridden in, and drove off at full speed, heading north through Gongguan Road and all the way away.</p>
<p>Car Number</p>
<p>At that time, a patrolman happened to be standing there. When he first saw that the symbol on the bandits' car was a white circle with the number 247 in it, he became suspicious. The patrolman knew that this type of car number was used by the military vehicles of a certain country, so he paid attention to it. When he saw four people carrying someone into the car together from the inn, he knew that something was wrong. He wanted to rush forward and order them to stop, but the car had already sped away.</p>
<p>Exchanging Gunfire</p>
<p>The patrolman chased after the car, shouting and pulling out his gun. At the intersection of Ningxing Street and Zhengjia Muqiao Street, the bandits in the car opened fire to resist arrest. The patrolman also returned fire, and the two sides exchanged four or five shots. In the end, because it was night and the patrolman was alone and weak, he was escaped. He watched the bandits' car drive towards Edward Road and disappear in an instant.</p>
<p>Injured by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>At the same time, the McClellan Police Station also heard the alarm and sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene. Unfortunately, the bandits had already fled far away. They returned to the Xinxinxiangji Inn to investigate. When the bandits opened fire to resist arrest, Luo Baozhong (51 years old), the boss of the Yongfengtai Tobacco Shop at No. 84 Ningxing Street (i.e., the northwest corner of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street and the Fourth Road), was hit by a stray bullet while packing up to close for the night. The bullet entered from the cheekbone next to the right nose and did not penetrate. He was sent to Renji Hospital. It is said that the injury is not serious. However, it is said that the French Police Department attaches great importance to this case and is currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>A Small Ship From the Lu Lin Foreign Firm Collided With a Sailing Boat; The Boat Owner Is Claiming More Than 10,000 Taels of Gold; The Two Sides Are Negotiating</h3>
<p>The Dalu Bao (Mainland News) reports that the small ship Kang Taier (245 tons) of the German firm Lu Lin Foreign Firm collided with a sailing boat heading to Shanghai outside of Wusong on the evening of the 31st of last month. The sailing boat sank immediately. All eleven people on board were rescued by Customs Steamer No. 302. The boat owner demanded 10,500 yuan in compensation from the Lu Lin Foreign Firm. It is said that the two sides are negotiating. If a solution cannot be reached, litigation may be initiated. According to reliable sources, the boat owner purchased the sailing boat about two years ago for 7,000 yuan, and then spent 1,500 yuan to repair it and about 1,000 yuan to purchase equipment. The iron anchor was worth 200 yuan. When it sank, the boat was carrying sand worth 1,200 yuan. The Kang Taier was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 1st, but due to the collision with the sailing boat, it did not arrive in port until 9:00 PM on the night of the 1st and berthed at Buoy No. 4.</p>
<h3>After 33 Years in China, Gauss Returned to the United States Yesterday; U.S. Navy Honor Guard Played Music to Pay Respects; Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries All Came to the Wharf to See Him Off</h3>
<p>The newly appointed US Minister to Australia, Gauss, left for the United States last night. Gauss left Shanghai at 4:45 pm. The honor guard of the US Navy Mackling team went to the Customs Wharf to play music to see him off. In addition, those who went to the wharf to see him off included British Consul General in Shanghai George, Japanese Consul General Miura, US Customs Commissioner Hielmik, SMC Director General Fankling, Australian Commercial Representative in China Bowton, SMC Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, etc. Gauss shook hands with each person, and then, in the melodious music of the US Yangtze River Fleet, bid farewell by waving his hat to the shore with US Yangtze River Fleet Commander Grasefford, and sailed away. This old friend of China said goodbye to this familiar city.</p>
<p>A Brief Stay in Washington</p>
<p>Gauss will leave port on the Tiger President this morning at 1:00 AM. After arriving in the United States, he will stay with his family on Balboa Island for three weeks, and then go to Washington to report to President Roosevelt and take the oath of office. Gauss hopes to stay in Washington for a month, as Washington is Gauss's hometown.</p>
<p>Served in China for 33 Years</p>
<p>He was born there on January 12, 1887. He also studied law in Washington. In 1906, Gauss was recommended to serve in the government, as the secretary of Deng Pei, an expert on Far Eastern affairs. In 1909, when Deng Pei was transferred to Shanghai as Consul General, Gauss was called to accompany him, but Gauss returned to Washington in the same year to continue his studies and prepare for the national diplomatic examination. However, Gauss did not retire and continued to serve in the national diplomatic service. In 1913, he returned to Shanghai as Vice Consul. Since then, Gauss has repeatedly served as Consul in Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinan, Shanghai, etc. In 1931, Gauss was recalled to Washington, and Gauss served in the Department of Far Eastern Affairs when the September 18th Incident occurred. On February 3, 1917, Gauss married Miss Louise from California. In November 1918, his wife gave birth to a son in Los Angeles, named Pike Gauss. In 1933, Gauss first took office in Peiping, and in 1934 he was transferred to Paris to serve in the embassy. In 1936, he returned to Shanghai to serve as Consul General, for five years. He has served in China for 33 years, so all parties call him a friend of China. As for the issue of the new consul's selection, the US government has not yet made any announcement.</p>
<h3>Japanese Police Officers in the SMC Resign in Protest</h3>
<p>The Japanese are trying to control the police power of the settlement and are willing to use various methods. One Anchuan Shixiong was originally the director of the Japanese team of the traffic section of the SMC. Recently, he made four demands to Mr. Baker, the head of the traffic section: (1) expand the authority of the Japanese team of the traffic section and allow it to be independent; (2) remove the subordinate status of the Japanese team to the Westerners; (3) expand the use of the Japanese team police; (4) the treatment of the Japanese team police must be equal to that of the Westerners. This opinion was completely rejected by Baker. The Anchuan Shixiong submitted his resignation on the afternoon of the 2nd as a threat.</p>

<h3>Litigation Case of Refusing to Compensate for Losses in the Battle of Shanghai; Huadong Company Sues American Insurance Company</h3>
<p>American Customs Commissioner Asks Philippe to Testify; The Dalu Bao (Mainland News) reports that Huadong Electrical Appliance Company at No. 959 Zhoujiazui Road suffered significant losses during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937. However, the company had war risk insurance with the American Family Insurance Company, so it requested compensation of US$27,160.75. The Family Company argued that Huadong Company was slightly damaged during the war and that its machines had been transported to the south side of the Suzhou River before the war.</p>
<p>Refused to Compensate</p>
<p>Huadong Company filed a lawsuit with the US Customs Commissioner's Office in China. The US Customs Commissioner's Office has held several trials. The retrial was held on the 2nd and asked Philippe, the General Manager and Director of the SMC, to appear in court to testify on the extent to which the SMC has jurisdiction over the northern district of the Public Concession. The Family Company's lawyer Nelson asked whether the SMC's recent agreement with the Japanese side on the Northern District</p>
<p>Police Agreement</p>
<p>Has taken effect. Philippe replied that this question was difficult to answer, but the two sides had reached "some compromises." Philippe replied to another question that after the Japanese occupied the northern and eastern districts of the Public Concession, they soon promulgated traffic regulations in the area and sent sentries to the bridges on the Suzhou River to prevent people from traveling north from the south bank. The Japanese did not consult the SMC for both of these actions, but</p>
<p>British Troops in This City</p>
<p>Did not consult the SMC either, and sent British sentries to the bridges on the Suzhou River. Nelson asked whether the SMC protested when the Japanese bus company took over the British bus routes in the northern district. Philippe replied that this issue was not public in nature and that he did not intend to answer. At this point, Nelson presented the bureau's protest on the matter. Philippe then said that he recalled that in 1938</p>
<p>Protested</p>
<p>The Japanese bus company is still infringing on the British bus company's privileges in the northern district. Later, Mr. Hoden, the Chief Patrol Officer of the SMC Police Department, testified that since 1938, the Japanese Residents Group had instructed their employees to plunder in Yangshupu. At that time, he was working at the Yulin Road Police Station and witnessed the Japanese Residents Group</p>
<p>Transporting Scrap Iron</p>
<p>To Japan must be countless times. The police station protested to the commander of the Japanese Navy Landing Force barracks on Huacheng Road. The commander replied that the Japanese Residents Group had a "permit to clear the area." The Japanese had all obtained permits specifying the names of certain roads, and that all objects in between were Japanese property. Mr. Ju Kesilin, a reporter for Tzu Bao (Word News), testified that he was</p>
<p>Taking Pictures in the Northern District</p>
<p>In January 1938, he saw Japanese people and Chinese coolies loading iron into trucks. He remembered seeing the Japanese looting scrap iron near Huadong Company on Zhoujiazui Road. Previously, when the case was heard, other witnesses testified that the Japanese Navy Landing Force had systematically plundered in the eastern and northern districts at the end of 1937. Nelson, the lawyer for the Family Company, argued that the removal of Huadong Company's machines, etc., was ordered by the military authorities controlling the area, so it was not covered by the "plunder" clause of the war risk insurance.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Negligence Against the Head of Surgery at Bao Long Hospital: Surgical Incision for Chest Discomfort Proves Fatal; Xie Jia-shu Denies Negligence, Claiming Incurable Disease; Case Requires Summoning Witnesses, Plaintiff Requests Exhumation for Autopsy</h3>
<p>Xie Jia-shu, the head of surgery at Bao Long Hospital on Baker Road (age 29, from Songjiang, a graduate of Tongji University Medical School), was recently sued in the First Special District Court by Hui Zhu Shu-xiang, a woman residing at 572 Yu Qiaqing Road, through lawyers Cai Zhi-su and Weng Wei-xian. She accused Xie of causing the death of her husband, Hui Ming-zhi (age 39, from Yixing, an employee in the confectionery department of the New World Company), due to negligence, and requested that he be punished according to Article 276 of the Criminal Law. According to Hui Zhu's statement and her lawsuit, her late husband, Hui Ming-zhi, had always been in good health but suddenly experienced chest</p>
<p>occasional discomfort</p>
<p>around December of last year in the lunar calendar. However, because his appetite was strong and his spirits remained high, they did not suspect anything else. But on February 17th in the Gregorian calendar, Hui Ming-zhi passed by Bao Long Hospital on Baker Road and decided to go in to ask about the cause of his chest discomfort. The hospital ordered him to be admitted for observation and requested a deposit of one hundred yuan for hospitalization. Hui raised the funds and paid the fee, being admitted to the hospital that day. He was subsequently examined by the defendant, Xie Jia-shu. On the 31st, Xie stated that surgery was necessary. Both Hui and his wife expressed opposition and</p>
<p>asked about the cause of the illness.</p>
<p>According to Xie, the cause could not be determined without surgery, and he insisted on performing the operation. Eventually, the surgery was performed. On the 26th, Hui's wound suddenly bled profusely. His wife requested that he be given an injection to stop the bleeding. However, the doctor demanded a fee of ten yuan for the injection before administering it. After she went out to raise the ten yuan and paid it, a hemostatic injection was finally given. However, a significant amount of time had passed, and the excessive bleeding led to his death. Hui believes that her husband's death was due to Xie Jia-shu's professional negligence, disregarding human life and using her husband as an</p>
<p>experimental sacrifice.</p>
<p>Therefore, she filed a lawsuit. Yesterday morning, this case was heard in the Third Criminal Court by Judge Liu Yu-gui. According to Xie Jia-shu's testimony, the deceased suffered from liver cancer, which is an incurable disease. Even without surgery, there was no hope. After the surgery, it was discovered that the entire area had become cancerous, so no surgery was performed, and the incision was sewn up. He also stated that the surgery was performed by the hospital director, Dr. Bai De, himself, with Xie assisting. The deceased also</p>
<p>signed a consent form.</p>
<p>The signed form was presented to the court. Hui Zhu Shu-xiang, after reviewing the signed form in court, claimed that it was a forgery and that her late husband's handwriting could be verified. She also stated that her husband had requested an X-ray to determine the cause of the illness upon admission, but the defendant did not comply and rashly performed surgery. The court stated that the matter still required the summoning of witnesses and adjourned the hearing for one week. The plaintiff's lawyer, in order to clarify the facts, requested an exhumation for examination. The court stated that the request would be considered.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Two Prosecutors</h3>
<p>Zhao Chang-min, prosecutor of the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, and Wang Ren, prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, have been ordered by their superiors to exchange offices. After receiving the order, both Zhao and Wang completed the handover of case files yesterday and went to their new posts.</p>
<h3>Fine for Copyright Infringement</h3>
<p>During the spring sales of textbooks from the Zheng Zhong Bookstore on Fourth Avenue, pirated books suddenly appeared on the market. It was found that these pirated books were reproduced using photographic printing, resulting in blurry characters, unclear outlines, poor paper quality, and insufficient size. In order to protect the convenience of readers and safeguard its own legal rights, the bookstore sent people to investigate. They discovered the sale of pirated books such as "Junior High School Chinese Culture" in the Modern Bookstore in the French Concession. After the discovery, the bookstore hired someone to mediate, voluntarily compensated for the losses, and published statements of apology in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers, promising not to sell them again. At the same time, pirated books such as "Junior High School Geometry Algebra" were also found being sold at the Xie He Bookstore, Wen De Bookstore, and Lian Yi Bookstore in the British Concession. The Aihong Road police station filed a public prosecution with the Special District Court, and Hua Jia-dong and Wang Yong-lin were sentenced on the 28th of last month for knowingly selling goods with counterfeit trademarks, each fined twenty yuan. It is reported that the bookstore is currently collecting evidence and will file a claim for damages with the First Court of the Special District. A certain collector, based on his lifelong experience, has collected no less than hundreds of pieces of calligraphy and paintings from various dynasties, all of which are masterpieces by famous artists. In order to solicit opinions from experts from all walks of life, he has decided to hold an exhibition at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association on Edward Road for four days, starting on April 5th. All sectors are welcome to provide fair evaluations. It is also reported that famous Shanghai artists will be present to appraise the works for identification. A grand occasion is expected.</p>
<h3>Holding a Large Sum of Money, Attempting to Gamble, Ultimately Losing Everything in the Gambling Den, Lying About a Robbery to Avoid Accountability, Exposure of the Crime Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>Ling Jue-qian, a Cantonese man residing at 56 Yue Village, Yidingpan Road, worked as a typist at the Meizuishi Foreign Firm on Jiujiang Road. Previously, at 10:45 AM, Ling was ordered by Dickman, a German employee of the firm, to take a check for 4,900 yuan to the French Bank to cash it and purchase a remittance to the Citibank, in order to remit the money to Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, after Ling</p>
<p>cashed the check</p>
<p>he did not return to the firm until evening, claiming that he had encountered several robbers on Yidingpan Road near Yu Yuan Road, who threatened him with guns, took him to a certain place, robbed him of the money, and imprisoned him for several hours before releasing him. The firm found Ling's statements suspicious and reported the information to the Jing'an Temple police station. Detectives Ni Jia-feng and Xi Tan Kai-nai-tai brought Ling to the police station. Under investigation, it was revealed that Ling's claim of being robbed</p>
<p>was a lie.</p>
<p>It turned out that Ling's family was poor, and his wife was pregnant and about to give birth, with no funds available for childbirth expenses. Having a large sum of money in hand, he went to the Xilai Men gambling house on Jing'an Temple Road, hoping to win a few hundred yuan to cover the expenses. Unfortunately, his luck was bad, and he lost every bet. Within two or three hours, he lost all 4,900 yuan he had received. Unable to make amends, he lied about the robbery. After the police learned the truth, they ordered</p>
<p>Ling's detention.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police officer Zhang Tian-yin prosecuted him for embezzlement and making false reports and presented the case, requesting a postponement for further investigation. When questioned, the defendant, Ling Jue-qian, confessed that he had lost all the money at Xilai Men and had none left. He stated that he was willing to find a way to return it. Judge Chuan Lin verified the confession and ordered Ling to be detained for a rescheduled hearing next Friday.</p>

<h3>Old News, Newly Copied: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (444)</h3>
<p>(From the "Shen Bao" of the 12th year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>On Customs</p>
<p>Shanghai, a corner of the world, gathers the splendor of several southeastern provinces, in contrast to the frugality of several northwestern provinces. Those who have not visited it either admire it or despise it. Those who are usually confident in their strict adherence to principles and have never faltered, suddenly take a trip to Shanghai, and their preferences become even more extreme than those who have lived there for a long time. How powerful is the influence of customs! Recently, the clothing of rural towns has begun to appear in the capital, and the pursuit of fashion is even more prevalent among actors. Today, clothes of honey color and bamboo root green are common, while sky blue and dark blue are neglected. Likewise, shoe stores offer a wide variety of styles, but only those from Tianjin are considered fashionable. The ugliness is not abhorred. Try to count the pedestrians around the foreign concessions, and seven or eight out of ten are wearing embroidered shoes, while only two or three out of ten are wearing cloud-patterned satin shoes, double-strapped shoes, or boots. Even the elderly in their fifties and sixties are keen on following the trend, let alone the young men. As for women's makeup, Suzhou is the most extravagant, but even in its glamour, it emphasizes elegance and simplicity. Brothels abound, competing in skill and beauty, and the wives and daughters of wealthy families often imitate them. It is understandable that people from Suzhou and Songjiang would do so, but even those from Hangzhou, Ningbo, and Shaoxing who have brought their families to live here also compete to emulate them. Hairstyles include pillow styles shaped like plates or turtles, Shaoxing styles shaped like ingots, and Ningbo styles shaped like dragonflies or cicada wings; nothing else is considered fashionable, making it impossible for onlookers to distinguish them from Suzhou natives. Recently, due to the popularity of high buns in brothels, they have also learned to comb their hair in that style. What is the point of such makeup, and why is it becoming so extreme? Is this not the influence of customs? If customs cannot be eliminated, then nature cannot be restored. This is true for everything, from the entire life of a person to a single matter. The number of good people is decreasing day by day, and the number of thieves is increasing day by day, all gradually accumulating from this. Everyone has their own nature, and the world cannot be without customs, but the harm of customs to nature is such that it is worrying for both the superiors and the inferiors.</p>

<h3>Words on Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Huang Jia-yin</p>
<p>The Children's Day of April has arrived again. As usual, there will be a Celebration Committee formed, and as usual, there will be a grand celebration. At the same time, as usual, many newspapers and magazines will publish articles criticizing the celebration of Children's Day, and as usual, many people will point out the tragic fate of most children. These are all good.</p>
<p>Indeed, on this, the ninth Children's Day, we should not forget our unfortunate little compatriots, especially those children struggling in the depths of misery and on the brink of starvation. We should not forget them even more.</p>
<p>We acknowledge that, under the current unreasonable social system, it is extremely difficult to seek welfare for the majority of children. We must recognize that only the rationalization of the social system can enable our little compatriots to enjoy genuine welfare. Therefore, on this Children's Day, we must firmly grasp our ultimate goal—to promote the realization of a rational social system.</p>
<p>Today, although the reform of the social system has not been realized, we can still do our best in our respective positions to seek the welfare of children and celebrate our Children's Day.</p>
<p>We must remember: today, planting one more good seed will result in one more beautiful flower blooming tomorrow. Everything is not in vain!</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>Releasing the Shackles on Children's Psychology</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yan-quan</p>
<p>The greatest mental suffering of modern children lies in the oppression they receive from adults, which deprives them of inner freedom. Chinese people have a traditional mindset of forbidding children from playing in general families. Their view is: "Playing will make the children's minds wild." The so-called scholarly families must firmly adhere to the maxim of "Diligence brings success, play is useless," and they want to force children to become mature at a young age and not to engage in various games. However, children are often uncooperative, and regardless of poverty, wealth, or status, nine out of ten like to play games. Thus, adults want to control them, and this attitude needs to be corrected in the 20th century. According to the psychological and physiological development of children, games have great value for children. Physically, games can promote blood circulation, develop muscles, accelerate the movement of internal organs, and improve digestive function. The body's resistance can therefore be greatly increased. Also, because most games are played outdoors and in spacious places, the air breathed can be fresher. Spiritually, games can produce pleasant and satisfying emotions, regulate mental fatigue, and release excess energy. A spirit of creativity and competition can be cultivated in games. Games also have great moral value, such as the habit of obeying rules, a fair and impartial attitude, loyalty to the collective, and the knowledge of collective life, and the virtue of honestly admitting one's failures and striving for improvement, all of which can be developed. Therefore, adults should only guide children's games and not oppress them. They can prevent them from engaging in overly strenuous and dangerous activities, but they cannot fundamentally eliminate them. Because eliminating games is tantamount to eliminating children's development.</p>
<p>Secondly, adults always hold on to their old-fashioned prejudices against children, instructing them on how to behave and not liking children to use trial and error to change their behavior. This is also a kind of oppression for children spiritually, and the so-called creative nature is all suppressed by adults. Thirdly, most parents hold the view that "beating produces filial sons," and they often excessively punish children, making them feel oppressed. This influence causes children to strive for liberation, and sometimes children reject external stimuli psychologically. For example, some children, because their father has a bad temper, learn to resist everything. Others become very shy, dislike being with others, or develop sexual perversions. Children with parents who have bad tempers or are overly strict are often the ones with the worst tempers or the most dangerous behaviors. Fourthly, many families often have a discriminatory view against women, which makes girls' inferiority complex develop even more, making them always hesitant and doubtful when they grow up. If doubt is excessive, they will think that only men are capable.</p>
<p>Fifthly, there is the oppression of children by schools and teachers. Chinese people have always valued the way of the teacher. "If the teacher is not strict, it is the teacher's laziness," which is also the creed of teachers. Teachers always ignore children's psychology and force children to swim in the sea of knowledge, making teaching difficult to be effective. Teachers mostly use punishment, reprimands, and admonishments to deal with problem children. But if they do not understand the child, then no matter how much they punish and admonish, it is useless.</p>

<h3>The Quiet Dahua Road</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shi-de</p>
<p>Here, I want to describe the situation on Dahua Road. It is a very short road between Jing'an Temple Road and Avenue Road, east of Gordon Road. However, although the road is very short and ordinary, many extraordinary things have been happening there one after another. Perhaps, some people think this is also very ordinary.</p>
<p>Dahua Road is a desolate road, and it is very quiet even during the day. The road surface is sand, mud, and stones. The sidewalks are also sand and mud, with only the edges of the sidewalks being cement. The two sides of the road are full of warehouses. When trucks come, the sand and dust rise ten feet high. After the trucks leave, there is no sound, and the sand and dust settle, and everything returns to peace. The sandy sidewalks are the mansions of beggars. Beggars are not often in their mansions during the day, because they also have to live, they also have to eat something to maintain their lives. Only when the weather is clear will they sit on the sidewalks to bask in the sun. Some sit there catching lice and chewing them in their mouths, making a particularly loud sound. I think they must be thinking about the taste of the delicacies and fine wines that the rich eat! Some close their eyes and sleep on the sidewalks to rest. The sun shines warmly. But after the night comes, cold and darkness surround them, and they can only huddle under the fences. At this time, they do not have so much leisure to imagine the food, clothing, and sleep of the rich. The only problem is the cold. Their bodies shrink into a ball, and their hearts also shrink into a ball.</p>
<p>When night comes, perhaps not a single figure can be seen on Dahua Road. They may be huddling in the corners of the walls of the big restaurants. However, Dahua Road is always quiet. Except for the sound of the wind, there is no sound at all. Only a street lamp some distance away shows a faint, cold light due to the blowing of the wind.</p>
<p>One night, when I was passing through Dahua Road, I suddenly saw the corpse of a child. On his pale face, nothing could be seen, only the expression of stillness. His small eyes were tightly closed. After that, I did not often walk on Dahua Road. However, I have seen it two or three times since, some wrapped in mats, others lying by the roadside in the clothes they wore when they were alive. Their parents are too poor, and I think this is the reason, which sometimes causes reactions and makes problem children even more problematic. The proper way to correct children is to understand their families, understand their dreams at night, understand their past experiences, and understand their archetypes, and know the bad consequences that occur in all life situations. Putting oneself in the child's past environment and thinking empathetically will create great sympathy for him personally. We have to change the archetype. We cannot simply use life experience to change it, because life experience is already organized according to his own apperception. We can only change him by starting from the root of his personality. For example, many children do poorly in school, and teachers do not like him, so he likes to quarrel, subdue others, and think it is a heroic behavior. But when we analyze it, he is far from a hero. He lacks social interest, leads a useless life, and does not have the courage to compete in his studies. This is a manifestation of cowardice. To change him, we should make him fully understand that his offense is a sign of cowardice.</p>
<p>If school rules are too strict, children's rules should not be formulated according to the principles of criticism, oppression, and punishment. They must be based on the principles of attention to training, education, social value, and development of children's interests. Schools should not allow children to overdo activities, but they should not restrict children's appropriate activities, and they should pay more attention to rewards, punishments, and guidance.</p>
<p>Ellen Key said, "The twentieth century is the century of the child." I hope everyone remembers this sentence.</p>

<h3>Hell in Paradise</h3>
<p>— Tang Ai-zhen</p>
<p>The "isolated island" is a paradise for children and also a hell for children.</p>
<p>As Children's Day approaches, what appears before our eyes is a picture of life with both joy and sorrow, accompanied by a symphony of children's cries and laughter; proceeding on the short journey of human life.</p>
<p>The children in "paradise" are lucky ones, the darlings of heaven. They grow up in wealthy families, and there are no problems with clothing, food, housing, and education... They are carefree and enjoy all the pleasures of the world.</p>
<p>The children in "hell" are unfortunate, the suffering "animals"! They grow up in poor families, with no clothing, no food, and no shelter. Education is out of the question. They wander everywhere, enduring all kinds of misery and suffering in the world.</p>
<p>In the joyful celebration songs of the "angels", we must not forget that on the "isolated island" there are still hundreds of thousands of poor and displaced children, suffering the ravages of storms in "hell"!</p>
<p>This group of pitiful "wailing wild geese" is waiting for us to save them. Happy people, in addition to enjoying their own happiness, must also think about the poor children, do what they can to help refugee children, and donate to charitable organizations, such as orphanages, nurseries, and refugee shelters. More efforts must be made collectively to set up refugee education and training centers in various ways, so that tens of thousands of homeless disaster-stricken children can have a place to settle down and receive education. This is not only the happiness of refugee children, but also the happiness of the entire nation's future.</p>
<h3>Parents and Children</h3>
<p>— Xiu He</p>
<p>Children are innocent and easily influenced: "If accustomed to blue, they become blue; if accustomed to yellow, they become yellow." Therefore, all parents should be constantly aware of the environment their children are in. The story of Mencius' mother moving three times holds great wisdom. Because even a moment of carelessness can expose children to negative influences. Here's a real-life example:</p>
<p>A child's parent told me that their child was stealing money at home and spending it recklessly, and the method of stealing was learned from a classmate. I immediately inquired with that classmate, and after gentle guidance, he admitted to telling him the method of stealing money. At this point, I inquired further, asking him how he knew this method. The child, true to his innocent nature, honestly told me, "One day Dad took me to see a movie, and there was a person in it who stole money and lived a very happy life. I thought it was kind of fun, so I told my classmate, and we discussed trying it out at home!"</p>
<p>After hearing this, I gave him a lecture, and he nodded repeatedly with tears streaming down his face. Then, after some more encouragement, he left feeling very touched.</p>
<p>Parents taking their children to see movies is a good thing in itself, but who would have thought that children with poorer judgment could be exposed to bad habits because of it!</p>
<p>A message to parents with children: Please be constantly aware of the environment your children are in, and do not let pure and innocent children fall into the abyss of misfortune without realizing it.</p>
<h3>Who is This Jesus? (II)</h3>
<p>Some people's perception of Jesus is the opposite of what was said above; they see Jesus as a great teacher. They don't ask about Jesus' background. They feel that Jesus speaks unlike others, with authority, which is very important. What good is it if a blind man leads a blind man? Jesus is not blind; his teachings are like a doctor's knife, able to pierce the heart, so Nicodemus felt he was a great teacher sent by God. Their great difficulty lies here: they see God through Jesus, but they cannot see that God is in Jesus, so they see Jesus as an ordinary teacher and cannot recognize him as the greatest savior of mankind. Another view, held by some of Jesus' disciples, is that Jesus would become a great leader of the nation. They saw a throne prepared for Jesus in the city of David. However, this view is also wrong. Jesus clearly declared, "My kingdom is not of this world." He was to wear a crown of thorns, but the world could not understand. One day, when Jesus was teaching, he asked his disciples, "What do people think of me? Who do they say I am?" The disciples answered, some said he was Elijah, others said he was Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. On the day Jesus entered Jerusalem, some people still asked, "Who is this?" Others answered, "This is Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee." This view is a slight improvement over the previous one. Their answer is correct; Jesus is a prophet. If the Jews of that day could have seen Jesus as a prophet, the Jewish nation today would have a splendid history for people to admire, and Jesus would not have had to weep for the beloved and hoped-for city of Jerusalem. After Jesus asked his disciples what people thought of him, he seriously asked them again, "But who do you say I am?" The outspoken Peter stepped out from the crowd and loudly said, "You are the Christ, the Son of God." From this statement, we seem to see Peter's eyes shining brightly, his hand on his sword, with an air of refusing to change his words even unto death. This view can be said to be at the highest point. Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God. A carpenter? A teacher? Yes. A leader of the divine? A prophet? Also yes. But none of these views can encompass Jesus. Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God. This is the correct view. If you want to study in detail, please write to P.O. Box 1227</p>

<h3>Talking About Children's Films on Children's Day</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>In recent years, various countries, in order to implement film education, are producing a large number of films for children. This allows any child to watch films suitable for them and avoids them going to the cinema to watch films that could have a negative impact. Everyone knows that Mouhe's films are not suitable for children, and even if they are, there are only a few exceptions. Therefore, if a country cares about film education and believes that films are not only for entertainment but also a good educational tool, it will specifically create films for children that can develop their intelligence and increase their knowledge.</p>
<p>The League of Nations in Geneva also pays attention to this issue, so it has specially set up a film import museum to promote film education. So far, European and American educational film authors can freely express their own ideas, so the artistic value of their works far exceeds that of professional writers who write scripts specifically for film companies.</p>
<p>The effectiveness of a film does not depend on the quantity; if a good film is produced every two or three years, the effect of this film will certainly be much greater than that of the thousands of films that flood the market. Unfortunately, profit-oriented film companies will never work hard in this area. This depends on the country being able to promote and subsidize it in order to rapidly advance film education.</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, it is not only the government authorities who should be concerned, but also the parents of citizens, who should maintain their right to choose influences for their children. If the films being shown are valuable in terms of education and art, parents may wish to watch and critique them first to see if the film is suitable for children. If it is confirmed that it is beneficial and harmless to children, then take the children to see it, which will have only benefits and no drawbacks. In this regard, the guidance and criticism of film critics should, of course, also fulfill their responsibility!</p>
<h3>The History of Greta Garbo, the Female Lead in "The Greatest Story Ever Told"</h3>
<p>— Liang</p>
<p>If you've seen "The Greatest Story Ever Told," you must be amazed by Greta Garbo, the female lead in the film. Because she is not a very well-known star! Yes, she is a newcomer to the screen, born in County Down in Northern Ireland. She showed a talent for acting at a very young age. Later, she participated in a general performance. She knew that she was not interested in anything but the theater. Unfortunately, her parents did not approve of her aspirations and insisted that she go to school. She had no way to resist and had to obey them, temporarily giving up her ideal of pursuing drama and first studying at the University of London and the University of France. Later, she suddenly suffered from a serious case of the flu that almost killed her. The doctors said there was nothing they could do, but she gradually recovered. However, her spirit for studying at school could never be restored. At this point, her mother realized that she was determined to pursue drama and that coercion would not work, so she no longer insisted and let her pursue drama. After performing in "Street Scene," she went to England to perform in "Too True to be Good," but only in a supporting role. Finally, things took a turn for the better. One day, she was sitting in a club when she was suddenly recognized by a producer. Soon, a contract was signed, and she played the lead role in "Golden AT Tow." Although this film was not very good, she was considered by the audience to be a new American actress. Later, when "Old Music" was released, she was recruited by MGM, signed a long-term contract, and was first assigned to co-star with Robert Taylor in "The Greatest Story Ever Told." Now she is waiting for MGM's first assignment of her new work. Audiences who love her, please wait and see. (Remittance to help the needy)</p>
<h3>The Secrets of the Sound Stage - How to Dub</h3>
<p>(6) The sound of an airplane flying is created in the same way as a motorcycle, except using drums and cylinders to strike.</p>
<h3>News of Actors</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Liang Yiming, a Sheng (male role) actor at the Great Stage, is the chairman of the Tianjin Pear Garden Guild. Last year, he and Zhang Shu, a Kun Dan (female role) actor, and others were hired to come to Shanghai. He represented the Tianjin disaster-stricken actors and requested relief from the Shanghai Actors' Union. They performed a grand charity show and received more than 3,000 yuan in donations, so he has made great contributions to the Pear Garden Guild. Recently, he has received several letters from the guild urging him to return to Tianjin to preside over the guild affairs, and preparations for a welcome are already underway. However, Yiming cannot get away from the Great Stage in the short term.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Star National Opera Troupe is performing in the Philippines. Recently, they have secured the services of Wang Junchen, a veteran of both civil and military roles, in Shanghai. He is scheduled to depart around the 10th. The troupe also needs to hire a stage director. Originally, they had their eye on Lu Wenyi of the Common Stage, but he is the general manager of the Common Stage and cannot leave for the time being. Now, Zhao Ruquan is recommending Meng Junwen, the eldest son of the late actor Xiao Mengqi. He used to sing Lao Sheng (old male roles) but now plays the qin (zither). He has a very rich collection of scripts. The two sides are still in negotiations.</p>
<p>Xiao Sheng (young male role) actor Yu Zhenfei, after announcing his performance at the New Stage, took the early train to Suzhou yesterday morning to sweep the tombs. He will probably stay in Shanghai for a month or so and then return to Beiping. Zhu Chuanming, the pillar of the Xianni Society, intends to go north with him to seek development.</p>
<p>There has been no news recently from Jia Biyun and Jin Lianxi, who formed the Meihua National Opera Troupe to perform in Little Luzon. Their families are very worried. Moreover, his eldest daughter, Ruizhen, is scheduled to get married on the 22nd day of the second lunar month to Yang Suolai, the elder brother of Yang Youying.</p>

<h3>Chinese Film News</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Ms. Fengzi, an editor for the Chongqing Central Daily News, will appear on the screen, taking on an important role in Situ Min's film "Hometown of White Clouds," which is a new production by the China Film Studio.</p>
<p>The "A Hundred Thousand Miles of Sky," a patriotic air combat film produced by the Central Photography Studio with all its might, has completed all its outdoor scenes in Yunnan. According to Li Gongke, the film's production manager, they are currently rushing to film a crowd scene and several indoor scenes. Once these are completed, the entire film will be finished. The authorities have scheduled a grand premiere in Chongqing on April 29, the anniversary of the Wuhan Air Battle.</p>
<p>Recently, two theaters have appeared in Kunming: the Nanping Grand Theater opened on March 15th, and members of the concert were invited to play. Another is the Kunming Grand Theater, which cost hundreds of thousands and is leased by the Southwest Film Cooperative, which opened with a performance of Peking Opera at 6 pm on February 22nd.</p>
<p>The "Little Master" and "Little Spy" performed by the Kunming Children's Troupe this time have received extremely high praise. In addition to expenses, the surplus of ticket revenue was used to donate 400 yuan to the army for the Spring Festival and 800 yuan to the primary school fund for the poor, with the remainder used to purchase equipment for the troupe.</p>
<h3>"Huang Tianba" - Different From the Rest</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zai</p>
<p>Period dramas are at their peak, and it seems that contemporary dramas have almost disappeared. Recently, a very unique period drama is about to be released, which is "Huang Tianba," written and directed by Xu Xinfu and starring Gu Lanjun. The production company is Danghua Film Company, and "Huang Tianba" is this company's debut. In fact, all the manpower and resources are the same as Xinhua Company, and it is still produced by Zhang Shankun. The most valuable aspect of this film is that its content is very different from that of ordinary period dramas. Other period dramas are usually tragic or romantic, while "Huang Tianba" is full of tension and danger, enough to inspire people and correct the declining trend, and is well worth watching. It is scheduled to be screened at the New Light Theater immediately after "The Emperor and the Assassin."</p>
<h3>"Hero of Troubled Times" - A New Type of Martial Arts Film</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Recently, "Guohua" produced a new type of martial arts film, "Hero of Troubled Times." The story breaks all the old patterns of gods and monsters, and the structure is extremely bizarre and tortuous. Chen Jingfang of the former Tianyi Company and Xu Tianren of the Central Photography Studio have all achieved new things here, and the new talents from last year's Star Performing Arts Training Institute have also each shown their skills. In addition, well-known stars such as Pi Rang William, Shu Shi, You Guangzhao, Zheng Zhong, Zhou Manhua, Yao Ping, etc. have all participated in the performance.</p>
<p>The story is set in the late Song and early Yuan dynasties. Lady Zhaohua, because her husband, Marquis Jiancheng, was killed and the country was destroyed, went to Guanzhong to secretly plot a restoration, gathering many extraordinary men and women. They robbed Wu Guanghan, who was in exile, causing the failure of the powerful and treacherous officials. Finally, the base, Lu Family Village, was surrounded and turned into scorched earth, so they sought a new location and sought to rise again. Sword curtains and clues are indeed a meaningful historical drama.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>(1) The Huaguang Drama Academy decided to perform two programs on the issue of daily employment for the foundation on April 7 at the New World Taigong Theater: three one-act plays, "False Marriage," "People of Pleasure," which target the real environment in Shanghai. Now they are stepping up training. (2) As a special performance by the Shanghai Drama Society, "Parasitic Grass" was written by Hong Shen and directed by Zhu Duanjun. The content is extremely humorous and satirizes degenerate women.</p>
