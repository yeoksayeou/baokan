<p>社評</p>
<h3>美國對日舉措的積極意義</h3>
<p>最近數日，美國種種舉措，漸决答復了美日商的廢棄後美國究將如何作為的疑問。如此答復，當然不是答復的全案而是答復的開始，誰都感覺不很痛快而却雙甚為滿意。按部就班，堅實穩定，這是美國國際的一貫政策，是美國外交的特有風度！</p>
<p>美國近日所決定的：一，增加進出口銀行資金一萬萬美圓；其主要的理由是對中國輿芬蘭得再放款各二千萬圓。二，擴充海軍，俾以六萬五千五百萬美圓，實現其兩年造艦計畫；其主要的理由是在太平洋完成其絕對優勢。三，撒銷財政部收買國外白銀之權力案，暫從緩議；其理由之一。惟恐不利中國。四，對日禁止輸出案，暫從緩議；其主要的說明，乃在聽任國務院注視時局演進情形。四端之外，（一）對日禁運軍火案，正在推進之中；（二）太平洋的關島等處，以及亞美兩洲的橋樑阿拉斯加等處，設立海空軍根據案，正在審議之中；（三）民意測驗院宣布，贊成禁止軍用品運往日本者，已遞增至百分之七十；（四）副國務卿威爾斯氏之奉命聘間歐洲，聞將與英國當局交換關於英美兩國遠東政策的意見。凡此種種，活現了美國國家應付遠東變局的神態。</p>
<p>美國國際政策的特長，在於把握其公道原則，一絲不苟，循序而進，但仍能在時間上保留餘裕，予對方以善自轉圜，適應公道的機會。他在一九三七年「八一三」之後，不斷的對於日本殷勤啟示；一九三八年底，纔予日本以全面的嚴正牒文；一九三九年六月，宣吿限期廢止美日商的；本年一月，商的實行失效之前，駐日格魯大使史預於三個月前發表誠懇而透闢的演說；到了現在，開始種種切實的舉措。在事實上，日本絕對不能抗達美國的壓力；在時間上，日本儘有悔禍改圖的餘地。我們從旁觀察，深覺日本竟不幸未能利用餘地以保持其光榮；却反而報之以種種粗鄙的咆哮，幼稚的恐嚇，引誘之以媚態與微利；這當然美國所不予理睬，而僅足以證明日本的無悔意。無誠意。</p>
<p>美國最近的舉措，使日本的具有理智，確能愛國者，更理解美國的眞意。更明瞭日本的危機；但是並不痛快的舉措，決不足以促使瘋在者迅即恢復其理智；不但如此而已，且將使瘋在者加緊追求所憧憶的迷夢，以為美國在時間上予彼以追求迷夢的餘裕，而日本祗須在中國霸佔壓榨，儘可以備今後急起直追，以與美國競擴海軍。此類迷夢。對於美國自是不無影響，然我們亦自由諒美國舉措所以不能痛快，有其政治上不得不然的原因；何況美國的舉措與中國長期抗戰的戰略，允兩相脗合。中國抗戰勝利之日，亦即美國解脫日本迷夢脅迫之時。</p>
<p>原來中國在期待於日本的祗有兩方式之一：其一是日本的澈底悔悟，自動放棄侵略，然後在絕對牛等的原則上，重新締立國交；其二是日本的澈底失敗，由財力兵力的崩潰而自此無復覬覦中國的可能，俯首就範於國際常軌。因此之故，抗戰的得失成敗，始終不以戰綫進退為標凖，而以日本力量所消耗的鉅細為衡量。戰到現在，日本為鎮懾其議會而在彼政治季節中所採取的軍事攻勢，無論在綏遠方面，在廣西方面，甚主在浙西方面，無一不暴露其為捉襟見肘，既成强弩之末；中國所誇者，亦即不在綏遠克復臨河，廣西反攻南寗，而在長期消耗戰略的功效，愈著愈宏！誰不愛和平，誰無茍安的下意識，因此期待日本澈底悔悟，自屬人情之常；然念及奇恥大辱，念及血債的慘痛，則與其期待日本澈底悔悟，母寗期待日本澈底失敗；此二方式，惟待日本自擇，而瘋在愈久，侵略愈酷，然後失敗愈慘，失敗愈澈底，這是必然的道理。</p>
<p>以此揆之美國的舉措，他再給中國以貸款二千萬美圓，在美國眞是九牛一毛；更以二千萬來比較去年一年的美日貿易，則祗及美國輸日（二萬三千餘萬）的十一分之一，祇及日本輸美（一萬六千餘萬）的八分之一，亦祇及美國對日本出超淨益的七分之二；貿易是大有裨於日本侵略的，故尚不必恭維美國為怎樣慷慨的豪舉。同時，二千萬美圓合之目前的實際涯價，幾及中國法幣二萬六千萬圓，洵非小數，在精神上與物力上當然大有裨於中國的抗戰；但比之中國抗戰中所犧牲的，亦祗夠抵補了很小的一部分。然而論大局關係，論利害影響，不但應以些一千萬美圓的貸款，另作一種估價，幷且應於美國的不即禁止對日輸出，追加一種意味。蓋中國但求繼續抗戰，有以最後一滴血，爭取最後勝利的雄、心；今則遠在最後一滴血之前，增加了二萬六千萬圓的外來新力量！這在任何標準之下所絕不能藐視的事情，無怪日本對此驚呼之為嚴重。在日本，自美日商的廢棄後，美國猶不立即禁止對日輸出，雖一方面似是日本尚有在美國市塲購求貨品的餘地，而自另一方面觀之，亦即是美國留此門戶，用以吸收日本的黃金白銀，以促日本減縮其血枯力竭的過程；使日本在軍事的失敗之外，在經濟方面以金銀的外流而終於澈底崩潰。這與中國的長期消耗戰略，不能不視為殊途同歸。</p>
<p>美國舉措雖令人感覺不痛快，禁止軍用品輸日案雖為美國國民百分之七十所贊成而尚未確立，然其目前舉措的具有積極意義，將有良好功效，實所不容吾定。</p>

<h3>煤米高漲無止境　市民生活受威脅　租界當局宜籌救濟辦法　囤積操縱應採有效取締</h3>
<p>本埠連日以來、市民所資以日用必需之品、市價均呈飛騰、允以米煤兩項、上漲無巳、國米因限價關係、幾絕跡市塲、西貢米則因匯市上升、昨亦躍出五十元大關、煤市亦日數漲、市民奔走相吿、咸引為生活上莫大之穩憂、一般人士、對操縱囤積者、咸盼租界當局能迅予遏止、俾市民生活、得以早日回復平定、各煤號對於囤存煤斤之客戶、並通知迅即出貨、其中六家煤號計囤存客戶訂貨達二萬噸之鉅、此外亦尚有私人囤積者、足證目前市上煤斤漲風、並非純因缺貨之故、即米糧存底亦並非不足、預料短期內如能實施有效折平物價辦法、市況當或可稍蘇、茲將各情分誌如次、</p>
<p>米價依然飛漲</p>
<p>上海豆米行業茶會市塲、於二十八年總結束後開市後、一般投機者操縱囤積、致米價驚人飛漲、破歷年之新紀錄、市塲交易、國米因租界當局之限價、正式交易絕跡、塲外暗盤交易叢生、頭號白米竟逾越限價每石十餘元之鉅、洋米因無限價關係、一號西貢竟破五十元大關、長此以往、影響民生、殊匪鮮淺、</p>
<p>豆米公會集議一切</p>
<p>豆米行業同業公會於二月十三日公告第一二一號、禁止越軌交易、第一一三號、應負各種義務之後、今米價依然飛漲、影響民生、洋米扣捐未能即辦、故已定今日下午四時、在愛多亞路十五號、舉行執監委員聯席會議、除集議如何穩定米價外、並設法勸導實行洋米扣捐、並聞該會為米價飛漲事、曾推派代表謁工部局何副總辦有所陳述、並會談如何穩定今後之米價、</p>
<p>平糶委會二期平糶</p>
<p>上海平糶委員會為救濟滬市平民、舉辦平糶以來、第一期已於二月六日結束、並定今日下午三時、在廣東路航運俱樂部、召開常務委員會議、集議第二期平糶日期及一切辦法、據新聲社記者咋向該會探悉、平糶日期內定二月二十三日、如籌備不及、則延長數天、並決定仍舊委託米號業同業公會會員米號辦理、價格是吾提高、待今日會議決定、關於勸募捐款、決積極進行、</p>
<p>集團訂米二批抵滬</p>
<p>上海民食調節協會舉辦集團訂購洋米後、各機關團體廠號公司等、委託該會訂購洋米者甚為踴躍、該會先後已訂購洋米（二號西貢）共計六批、二萬五千四百包、除第一批六千包巳抵滬外、第二批一萬包、亦已裝外輪抵滬、巳辦理墊款出貨等手續、第三·四·五·六·批即將繼續到滬、聞運日向該會申請委託代訂洋米者、較前更為擁擠、</p>
<h3>煤市極度混亂</h3>
<p>滬市存煤、據估計尚達五十萬噸、而售價反畸形在漲、致使其他物價、同蒙影響、威脅平民生計至鉅、大光社記者昨探詢原因、據悉各情如下、</p>
<p>水脚狂漲影響煤價</p>
<p>據談、此次煤價狂漲、　海防印度水脚已漲至二十五至二十七先令、與三個月前相差一倍以上、究其原因、當統制外匯時、同業競相預購外滙、人量訂貨、及歐戰後船隻均被統制航行、未經核准、不准行駛、來華船隻班期減少、因此種種、造成水脚在漲、而影響煤價急遽提高、</p>
<p>售價漲進十倍以上</p>
<p>雖然水脚價格騰漲而預進之存貸、並未全部運到、故二十五先令之新貨、迄無裝運來滬現在所售之貨物、尚係一百元以內之存貨、本日市價、開平塊三百元、（三月前七十元、戰前十二元、）煤屑一百七十元、（三月前四十元、戰前九元、）白煤一百七十元、（三月前八十元、戰前二十二元、）印度烟煤一百五十元、（三月前一百元、戰前無貨到滬、）因此投機競進、少數人復故抬售價、造成此日漲夜大之局面、更有同樣貨品、兩樣售價之奇談</p>
<p>滬市存煤並不缺乏</p>
<p>若謂存貨缺少、則浦東堆存者、共達六棧、每棧至少有七萬噸、浦西薩坡賽路·麥根路·各棧、亦達六萬噸以上、而煤球原料、亦有六萬噸、總計已達五十一萬噸、即使仍以日銷三千噸計算、亦有二十白可用、況目下僅每日千噸耳、益以海防運滬途中、有數十萬噸、每週必有十餘號駁船裝來、在天后宮橋起卸（每船的裝千噸、）故存貨缺少兩字、更非事實、</p>
<p>熟水用煤平售救濟</p>
<p>至於熟水業、前因煤價飛漲、無法維持、故有二百五十家宣吿停業外、並聯合向市商會煤業公會請求設法救濟、茲據探悉、巳由煤業三公司、自動集合煤屑六百噸、以九十八元之廉價（現應售一百七十元、）平售於老虎灶、每家一噸、故停業者多數已恢復營業、惟區區之數、僅足供少數日期之應用、故該業前途、依然黯淡異常、</p>
<p>煤球售價昨又激漲</p>
<p>煤球業原料頭號屑無貨、僅有一號屑應市、其成本經公吿如下、批發十二日售一百十六元、十三日售一百廿元、十四日售一百廿六元、昨售一百三十二元、零售每担自五元二角、五元八角、六元二角、而至六元八角、漲風之大、實無以復加、計分（一）原料成本、義泰與二號屑每公噸國幣一百元、大隆興二號屑每公噸國幣一百十元、通成公司二號屑每公噸國幣一百零五元、農歷正月初五之市價、（市塲首日市價）晨夕時有上落、頭號屑無貨、（二）製造成本、烘煤每公噸十一元、電費一元四角、人工一元一角、機器修理二元二角、回屑損失五角、事務費一元七角、上水車力一元八角、黃泥一元四角、合計製造成本每噸二十元零一角、煤屑原料九七折計算、現每噸最高市價、竟達一百十六元、每祖（一百市斤）六元一角、</p>
<h3>虹口開放之管理權問題　日方無交還訉　對防務尤注意　市民探視居倍增傷感</h3>
<p>字林報云、日方昨日（十四日）招待新聞記者席上、某記者問、日海軍陸戰隊發表公報、宣布自昨日午夜十二時起華人入公共租界日軍防區、無需出示通行證、且撤銷宵禁一事、是吾為蘇州河北區將交還工部局全權管理之預兆、日海軍發言人答稱、日海軍相信警務事宜、應儘可能由警務機關辦理之、但防務問題、則全屬另一事件云、各記者就此點續加詰問、發言人僅以「過渡時期必比較的長久、一語作答、旋稱、至於寬弛通行證之檢查一節、載運廢鐵·金屬·瓦磚與武器之卡車、並不在免予檢查之列、發言人答覆另一問話稱、開放虹口與西虹口及他區間一部份障碍物一事、尚未加以考慮、</p>
<p>昨晨開放</p>
<p>日方於進佔虹口閘北等區域後、曾頒發種「通行證」「市民證」限制、准由持證人通行、第三國人交通限制辦法、亦同時執行迄今、近日方企圖復興佔據區域內市面起見、常於昨晨起、按照宜佈撤銷該「通行證」辦法、已正式予以實行、所有一切中外行人、已可自由出入通行惟各處原有步崗之日軍、並未見撤退無論包裹箱籠等件、仍須逐一予以嚴厲檢查後、方准放行、頃據有關方面傳出消息、謂最近之將來、所有戰前行駛於虹口區域之電車交通、亦將恢復、</p>
<p>各橋一瞥</p>
<p>沿虹口區之外白渡橋·乍浦路橋·四川路橋、北江西路之文監師路、海寗路兩缺口·烏鎮路橋·新閘橋·造幣廠橋等、仍各有二名至三四名日本海軍特別陸戰隊、立於守望亭內、每橋每缺口之進出口、仍設路牌示明、倘有誤走、即飽以槍柄、進出人仍須脫帽示禮、入境者固屬甚多、而出境亦復不少、但均係前往探視住听、倍增傷感、旋即走出、</p>
<p>警戒地段</p>
<p>大光社記者昨曾赴該虹口區一帶巡視、見虬江路口·外虹橋·中虹橋·寳山路口等處日本哨兵、仍舊守立如常、北四川路底及北站、中央造幣廠·中山路平民村之日兵營前、仍設警戒、禁止通行、到處頹頃殘壁、冷落異常、沿途熙熙攘攘者、均為貧苦工人、北江西路甲區日軍防區內、亦十之八九為低級平民、</p>
<p>英軍駐防</p>
<p>蘇州河北北河南路錢業會館駐守之英國英格蘭軍、及界路旱橋·開封路·新垃圾橋·等處之守崗英軍、照舊駐防、屹然未動、觀其情形、似仍加緊防備、鎮靜防區治安、對於閘北·虹口·進入　仍嚴密予以注意、決繼續補助警力不足、</p>
<h3>救世軍　捐款用途　在滬募集之款　絕不移挪他用</h3>
<p>救世軍旅長莫利氏、對外聲　、該軍預定至本週末、可募集捐款八萬元、昨日有二十華人集體捐款五白元、該軍中將西門氏、又慨捐鉅款、以是慕集總數激增至七萬九千餘元、該軍軍官均極形興奮、莫利氏又言、在滬募集之款、涓滴皆用於滬上北平南京等處、該軍另行勸募、絕不移挪滬款、各界如有捐款、可送至該軍總部沙遜大廈四十號云、</p>
<h3>國內匯兌　通匯地點　匯至各口岸之匯款　須申請經審查合格</h3>
<p>中中交農四行聯合辦事總處、以各界對於四行通匯地點不甚明瞭、往往因此發生周折、故特印製四行通匯地點一覽、惟由內地匯至各口岸之匯款、必須先向四行內匯審核處巾請、經密查合格後始准通匯、茲由新聲社記者探錄四行通匯地點一覽表如下、（廣西省）桂林·梧州·宜山·　州·南寗·靖西·百邑·憑祥·柳州·田東·貴縣、（雲南省）昆明·蒙自·下關·祥雲·楚雄·保山·騰衝·芒市·徵江·曲靖、（貴州省）貴陽·盤驟·都勻·黔西·獨山·安順·遵義·鎮遠·畢節·黃平·銅仁、（四川省）重慶·新市區·成都·萬縣·三台·內江·江津·廣元·綿陽·南部·瀘縣·北培·自流井·南溫泉·樂山·灌縣·太和鎮·奉節·石橋·合川·合江·培陵·資陽·榮昌·簡陽·五通橋·隆昌·資中·宜漢·宜濱·南充·永川·大渡·、（湖南省）衡陽·常德·沅陵·零陵·邱陽·秀山·芷江·新化·湘潭、（湖北省）宜昌·老河口·×漢口、（江西省）撫州吉安·贛州·上饒“景德鎮·龍南·萍鄉·南城·寗都、（浙江省）永康·衡州·×寗波·紹興·海門·　江·嵊縣·×溫州·蘭谿·鎮海·金華·溪口·江山·東陽、（陝西省）西安·南鄭·寳鷄·寗羌·咸陽·涇陽·渭南·漢中·安康、（河南省）鎭平·洛陽、（甘嘯省）蘭州·天永·岷縣·平涼、（福建省）×福州·延平·建甌·三都·浦城·×泉州·漳州·永春·永安·龍岩·涵江·×鼓浪嶼、（寗夏省）寗夏·（靑海省）西寗、（西康省）雅安·（安徽省）屯溪·歙縣、（廣東省）韶關·×廣州灣、（上海市）×上海、×香港、以上內有×者為口岸、</p>
<h3>寗波形成出納要口　浙關稅收激增</h3>
<p>浙海關稅收、巳見激增、統計二十八年度徵收進口稅出口稅轉口稅、共計國幣三百七十二萬零二百四十二元八角、較二十七年度增加百萬元弱、尤以下半年稅收最旺、因去夏甬江一度停航、經復航後、而廣州北海等、相繼陷落、福州溫州又吿封鎖、浙關進出口貨物擁擠、稅收隨之而增、</p>
<h3>越界築路協定　有今日簽訂說　簽字後半披露協定全文　各國駐軍防區不致變更</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據日當局今日（十五日）聲稱、工部局總董樊克令與「上海市長」傅筱庵、將於星期五日午後四時　、簽訂關於滬西越界築路區管理問題之協定聞同時工部局與「市府」將披露協定全文、而日總領署亦將就此發表文告、公共租界工部局與偽「市府」談判越界築路警權問題、即將簽訂、所有派駐滬西區內之英美意各國防軍是否繼續防守工作、頗為一般市民所注意、咋據大光社記者向外僑方面探悉、英·美·　·一國駐軍、無論租界當局與偽方是否簽訂臨時協定、對滬西防守任務、當不致有任何變更、因各國防軍係代表各該國政府命令而來滬、分駐各處、　所有各車各處防守步哨及梭巡工作、仍照常辦理、</p>
<h3>虹口閘北　一片凄凉景象　探視故居者無限酸辛</h3>
<p>自從華軍西撒以後，公共租界的東北區（即虹口及楊樹浦），和鄰近租界的地區，便淪為沒有自由的地域。日軍當局為『復興』虹口閘北的市面起見，特於昨日起，取銷『通行證』的限制，宣吿將閘北虹口楊樹浦及浦東『開放』。</p>
<p>從租界到虹口楊樹沛區去的外白渡橋。二白渡橋（博物院路橋）和四川路橋，橋樑中間都佈置着鐵絲網架，日方放置的崗亭，仍舊站立着日本海軍陸戰隊，中間擺着「左側行」的木牌，這情形和以前沒有兩樣，只不過日兵已經停止對於「通行證」的檢查。還有從蘇州河北「甲區」內，北江西路海寗路口和文監師路口的兩個缺口，還架着緊密的鐵絲網，缺口兩旁的兩個日兵崗哨，亦依舊站立着。自從昨天早晨起，大概是因為第一天廢除「通行證」，並且天氣晴朗的緣故，所以從以上幾處通過到虹口楊樹浦一帶去的人，比平常是較擁擠；他們大都是乘便去探視刦後的故居，或久別的親友，但是却不是如日人所希求的「回歸」。</p>
<p>二年多來，虹口楊樹浦和以前是完全改樣了！尤其是楊樹浦帶，刦後景象，眞是凄涼。日海軍管轄下的虹口區域內，新設了不少的「洋行」，街頭牆壁上亦增加了不「味　素」「利比兒」……的廣吿招貼，花花綠綠的點綴着靜寂的角落，只有這批工部局的巡捕，却還依舊分佈在那裏，和戰前一樣担任着工作。</p>
<p>在「八一三」以前，英商公共汽車和有無軌電車，有幾路是經過虹口楊樹浦地區的，現在取而代之的便楚日商「華中公司」的公共汽車，分綫行駛着。</p>
<p>在這公共汽車站頭，都新貼着一張佈吿，它的大意是：自即日起，華中都市公共汽車上祇限用日本軍用手票，否則若使用中國法幣，須加倍給資</p>
<p>閘北自從遭了砲火的洗刦後，已經成了一片瓦礫空塲，寳山路虬江路一帶，倖存的幾幢房屋，除了點級着幾塊新開「洋行」的招牌以外，都緊閉着脾鬥。其餘幾條往昔非常繁榮的馬路，現在却祇有一些斷垣殘壁，情形十分荒凉死寂。兩路管理局大樓，已經只賸一個瘡痍滿目的軀壳。後面却新築了一批低矮的房屋。四週的瓦礫荒地上，都豎立着「租界部隊用地」字樣的木牌。蘇州河北岸的叫行倉庫，已經雀巢鳩佔，粉刷着「中央市塲」的大字。但是却還很容易使人回憶起當年英勇的可歌可泣的故事。</p>
<p>浦東的情况，大致還沒有多大的變化，只不過情況是比前黯淡許多，並且在沿浦江一帶新添了許多使人啼笑皆非的標語招牌罷了。</p>
<p>宣佈開放以後，戰後新興的特殊事業一代領通行證的旅行社和製售派司套的商販，以及專以「通行證」來發財的人，便受了一個嚴重的打擊。這正和目前「孤島」上的許多事業一樣，曇花一現，終是難免趨向沒落的！（大通）</p>

<h3>肅清賭窟之謎　日方否認發表封閉消息　工部局人士亦感覺疑惑　事實上南市已有賭窟準備開張</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、日陸軍發方人昨（十四日）晚招待新聞記者時聲稱、渠既未公開披露日方對滬西賭窟之正式見解、亦未聲明日陸軍特務部將封閉「歹土」中罪惡塲所、英文大美晚報曾載渠在前此招待新聞記者席上宣稱、日方將封閉此等塲所之訊、實則渠未發是言云、發言人續加說明稱、前此招待新聞記者完畢後、某記者又以「謠傳日陸軍擬封閉賭窟等、是否確實」、相叩、渠乃非正式答覆該記者謂、「日方當然重視此事、或將有所主張」、渠不解此項非正式答覆、何能作為招待席上之正式聲明、</p>
<p>月底封閉已有傳聞</p>

<p>米市自前午稍見回疲後、昨日開手、一般人心、見市面變化劇烈、多所顧慮、不敢貿然大進、都抱觀機、所以早市形勢呆木異常、無論零躉兩胃、均鮮問津、獨售方仍居奇不售、穩健者有錢可賺、亦有回出、故西貢火紋行情悉落三五角、近午突聞滙水又縮、一般作客乃對於採納之心復堅、霎時互相競購、客販喊聲又起、市面即復回昂、至收盤先疲後緊、堪稱定格、西貢火絞以及東砶尖等價、悉與前盤無甚上落、不過白元以行盤最低、去路轉廣、所到亦僅丹陽貨二三車而已、致價續升元砠、丹陽白元做開四十五兀、至於厚薄粳等國米、已屬公開秘密、洋米價格旣達此五十元之高峯、其杜米豈忍依限而售、都在市塲之外、開成暗盤、聞昨崑山粳有售五十五元、薄稻五十二元之說、至是否事實、祇有向市塲去訪查耳、</p>
<p>洋米昨日升降不一、早市買氣極旺、一號西貢自四十八元半漲至四十九元八角、旋因定貨作實與前定到滬、售手較鬆、回至四十九元、午後被滙縮金漲影響、價又昂達五十元關口、回籠貨晨市平平、午後買戶熱烈、貨方趁機喊高、市面突呈混亂、前開小絞與二號暹暹五十五元三五角者、均喊高至五十六七八元之鉅、雖無正式成交、而人心更被搖撼矣、新交易定實小絞五千噸、價五十五元三角、二號暹邏二千七百噸、價五十五元半、惟午後新接洽者均難接近云、</p>
<h3>粉價暗漲不已　日廠收辦小麥</h3>
<p>麵粉昨日暗漲不已、查本街批價、名為十元原盤、但市上出十元之價、不易買得此種責任之在廠方、抑在店方、無能道之、反觀回籠貨無日不在居奇扳俏中、　綠　車棧單售價已達十五元三角、又創最新紀錄、其餘兵船及老車棧單、亦莫不同時提高、惟此種交易、既非正市、亦為暗盤、聞廠方有在暗中收買、以便限制粉價之再漲、所以日廠粉鳳風牌、亦已抬至十四元六角、尚有北洋帮向福新阜豐批購之紅財神紅桃花等粉價仍為十三元、成交各有數千包、</p>
<p>麥昨日堅穩如常、因市供售者寥寥、非到相當售價、不願脫手、有某日廠收進蘇常等麥十餘車之多、價為二十三元、華廠方面、除直接送廠貨外、尚無正式妥交、</p>
<h3>麩皮同時居奇</h3>
<p>麩皮連朝隨粉麥在漲不已、</p>
<p>查目理申存尚有十多萬包、但大都操於囤戶手中、堅守不肯脫、昨由福新廠售出五千包、價達十五元空前高峯、較總結賬前父飛升二元之巨、回籠貨交易亦有近千包、除內地帮略有少數需取、去路以囤戶為大宗、（仁）</p>
<h3>紗花　投機集中　紗市暴騰　雙馬到八四四元</h3>
<p>紗市續升、且漲風奇熾、此因黃金飛漲、而匯市堅縮、人心惶惶、買風劇烈、據市塲言、證券及金業市股票商一律紛紛出動、大衆拋進、所以紗市乃扶搖直上矣、此種漲風、殊堪恐怖也、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、外匯雖平定、然塲中買者叢集、二十支雙馬一漲十元、旋以買戶仍踴、再漲十元、價為八百三十二三元、此價盤旋甚久、迨至十一時將近、聞滙票轉硬、檯面上風勢、堅挺萬丈、步步前進、一跳十七八元、二十支雙馬價為八百四十四元頂高峯收盤、查半日間成交三千一百十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲三十元今日有紗三件運香港、一百〇七件運廈門、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<p>本棉交易益覺發展、同行中之買賣、尤其熱鬧也、良以紗市猛跳、外滙趨縮、投機交易興奮異常、市價乃節節前進、通花已漲至一百九十元、比上日漲六七元之譜、但廠方需要未起、蘇北來源未兌、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日晨初先因投機者之購買而漲、後因同業購買、及空頭抵補而漲、結果收盤價格較之上日漲起十餘磅音、印度速同預測漲三羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、利物浦漲七八便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日又因棉紗價格之飛漲、外棉交易因之頗為活躍、各方購意殊為濃厚、尤以同業為最、交易異常熱鬧、廠方購意較為淡薄、市上印棉之存貨幾被搜購一空、即裝者亦己有做開、昨日成交總額的有三千包之譜、昨日午後滙兌又趨緊縮、故一般預測、棉價將繼續高翔也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙七元折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>證券　洋股一度興奮　內債頗形堅穩</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况趨勢仍屬堅定、微微上漲、惟因金子繼續在漲、已超出上次最高價、公債多方因此頗有出籠、收盤後價又回小、但金子所以漲、乃因有發行金庫券之謠、公債之所以回鬆、不過人心關係、與大體實屬無關、在此通貨膨脹之情形中、公債實無下跌之理山、執貨者認識不消、故有恍惚不定狀况耳、昨日聯益泰硬買進、頗有胃量、散戶亦有收購、雖在六十四號及聯和永豐潤利等賣氣之下、仍能稍漲數角、足見公債有小回、市價結果、微好二角至四角半、成交總數計的五十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>響應成都中學生的「減低書價運動」</h3>
<p>— 一個中學生堯</p>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>讀了貴報二月十四日敎育欄內的成都航訊一則，不禁使我發生十二萬分的表同情。忙裏抽閒來寫這封信，要求你把它披露出來，響應這「减低書價運動」，救救我們這一般窮學生，我希望你接受我們這一點點苦衷。</p>
<p>成都市二十三個中學校學生，為書價過高，求學困難，所以發起組織「减低書價運動」，我們認為這種運動是迫切需要的；尤其是在目前狀况的孤島上，更有其特殊的密切關係。</p>
<p>戰前一本書定價一元的，照例可打七折或是八折，在學校開學上課前的幾星期，甚至可享得一個六折的優待，這樣在戰前定價一元的書本子，祗須實洋六角就可以購到。現在却大不然了，本來定價一元的書籍，現在除增高定價外，還須加上三成五成不等，這樣一來，原來可以六角購到的，現在差不多要出三倍於前的高價才可買到，這種增價的加速度，確可使人生畏！</p>
<p>像我一個高中學生，每學期的書籍用品費，總非十一二元不行，（大部分還是舊攤上購的舊書），平時所購備的參考書還除外，這學期因為是畢業的半年，所以新書籍要買的很少，比之上學期所購的本數還不及三分之一，然而算來連文具用品費在內，竟用去了十元五角八分，如果是高二的學生，那單單就書籍費一項，恐怕就要二三十元了吧？</p>
<p>在這百物飛漲的當兒，照例說起來，書價自然也由於「成本」的關係，不得不增加，不過我們還請求各書商在可能範圍之內，盡量减低書價，减輕我們這一般窮苦學生負擔。</p>
<p>同時，還請求校方酌量加多印發講義，减少不必要的書籍，最後，還希望各方以愛護自己子女學業的熱情，給予我們有力的援助，來響應「减低書價運動」，切實地推行，不談了，祝你好。　一個中學生堯上</p>
<h3>談米價</h3>
<p>— 青桐</p>
<p>由於米蛀虫的居奇操縱，米市塲紅盤一開，各米價格便都超出了四十元的限價；暗盤並有在五十元以上的。</p>
<p>讀日前本報一六十七年前舊報新抄」，記寗羣因「雨雪連綿，為時甚久，」而『柴米因而陡長」，『上白米每石四千八百文，次白亦須四千六百文，」已稱為「米珠薪桂」，較諸今日，直不可同日而語。</p>
<p>又見某筆記談米價一則說：「考之往史，、得知米價從來貴時多而賤時少。觀以下所記，可以知矣。吳越時，米一石不過數十文。淸康熙五年，田禾大熟，石米銀四錢。乾隆二十七年，米產特豐，斗米不足百錢。而當時已以為貴者，有宋紹興丸年之斗米千錢。明嘉靖二十四年之石米銀一兩六錢；四十一年之斗米一百七十文；萬歷戊子之斗米銀二錢；崇禎十四年之斗米銀四錢；淸順治八年之每石銀四兩；康熙十八年之每石銀一兩四錢；乾隆十三年之斗米二百文；二十年之斗米二百五十文；五十一年之斗米五百六十文。道光三年大水，斗米亦五百六十文；二十九年，亦因水災又貴四十文一斗。同治元年，兵事甫定，石米賣十二千五百文。而最貴者莫如梁武帝天監元年之斗米五千，則有史以來所僅見。」</p>
<p>現在的米價，非但和「當時已以為貴者」不能相比就是『有史以來所僅見」的『斗米五千」，也相去遠甚了。一方面固然說因為各時代生活程度的不同，但五十塊錢就是一百五十千，一百五十千文一担米，恐怕歷史上沒有一偭人會意想得到吧！</p>
<p>同治十二年間奪羣的「米珠薪桂」，已經是「鄉人日食維艱」了，在米價如此高漲的「孤島　上，叫薪級階級的小職員們如何過活呢？我們仍希望輿論的指摘和租界當局的制裁，能使米蛀虫的投機國積，稍稍斂跡；同時更期待着各方面能够商討出一個最妥善的辦法來安定民食！</p>
<p>生活報告</p>
<h3>裁縫店學徒</h3>
<p>— 文卓</p>
<p>雖是一段短短的問答，郤包括了上海畸形繁榮下，被壓迫者的一羣普遍的生活狀况。下面就是那一段會話：</p>
<p>「你幾歲了？什麽地方的人呀？我開始問他。</p>
<p>「泰州人，十一歲了。」</p>
<p>「你們的吃喝起居怎樣？」</p>
<p>一先生！你想得到嗎？每天夜裏十二點鐘睡，四點鐘就得起來。如果活計要忙的話，兩點鐘才睡也是常有的。吃呢，也不過吃點老闆師夫等吃下來的殘羹冷飯。每日兩頓，早上一頓粥，下午一頓飯。」</p>
<p>「你們每天作些什麼事情？」</p>
<p>「唉」每天從早上起來，一直頂到深夜，沒有片刻休息的時候。起來之後先升火燒水，再到小菜塲賣菜。賣菜回來，大師夫老闆等差不多都起來了，趕快給疊好被褥。倒馬桶的又來了，涮完馬桶，天已大亮了，己有人來找做活。在這略為停手的辰光，還得給老闆娘看孩子。不然就是燒熨斗，送衣服，或站在師夫的一旁學點手藝，不過很少有這種時候</p>
<p>「旣然这樣苦，你為什麼不作别业，而学裁缝呢？」</p>
<p>「先生！你不知道我们的苦處啊！我入這個裁縫店還是爹爹托了很多人呢！况且還訂有契的，是不出師不准退工回家，學徒有疾或走失（筆者註：恐學徒受虐待後潛逃而其家庭中追究）老闆不負責任，只好熬着，有什麼法子呢？」</p>
<p>「那麼你們出師後的待遇怎樣呢？</p>
<p>「少的很！要是在老店中</p>
<p>，每日一角錢；到店中或許能賺到二三角錢一天。或者先生你覺着我們賺的錢太少，先生！你要知道，我們的老師夫每天也祇有六七角錢好賺呀！」</p>
<h3>「勤學旗」</h3>
<p>— 燁爍</p>
<p>弟弟讀書的一家中學，和妹妹讀書的一家小學，在廢曆年前十二月一日都開課了。</p>
<p>七日，就是廢曆大除夕的那一天，下午四點鐘妹妹從小學裏放學回家時，帶來了一張學校裏的通知書，上面寫的是：「啟者，本校自八日起放假三天」等語。</p>
<p>弟弟的學校裏，並沒有放假。在年初一的早晨，仍然和平時一樣，挾了書包去上學，不料去了一個鐘點，又回轉家來，對我說：「學校裏同學來上課的倒不少，不料先生却沒有到齊，我們只上了第一課，下面幾課所担任的先生都沒來，所以只好叫我們回家。」</p>
<p>像以上兩種情形，前者「公然放假」。已屬大大不該，而後者的「無形放假」，更屬非是。廢曆新年中學生「逃學」，是學生本身的事，尚不會害及全體，而敎師們如果「逃敎」，那將要關及學生全體的，這在敎師的良心和私德方面，顯然是有相當的不對，而學生們光陰的損失，那還是其次呢！</p>
<p>所以我主張將「勤學旗」先送給敎師們，不，或許應該說「勤敎旗」。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第二十回　世界交通同文共語　兒童敎育獎學憐才</p>
<p>當葉誦芬家要掉換那個送報人的時候，他們的女傭人，就說起：隔壁那個小送報人，送報就早得多，有時我們剛剛起來，到竈下去生煤爐，已聽見他在敲隔壁的後門，報已經送來了。而且不論天晴天雨，終是那辰光送來。有時雨下得很大，他寗可自己身上雨落得很潮，把報紙包在衣兜裏，不讓它潮濕咧。葉太太說道：「那來我們以後，也敎他送就是了。老張媽！你是起得早的，你留心着！明天隔壁送報來時，你就可以關照他。」老張媽答應了，到了明天，開了後門等着他。及至隔壁的送去了，老張媽却在後門裏面喊道：「喂！小送報的！小送報的！」江鏡蓉最怕葉家的人和他有什麽兜搭，他假做不聽見，挾着報紙就跑。老張媽一想不好，不喊住了他，回頭太太要怪怨她。便飛步追出去，把江鏡蓉一把抓住，說道：「小送報的！你耳朶阿聽得？我們這裏每天一份申報，一份中美日報，你每天也是這辰光送來。」江鏡蓉道。「這個……」老張媽道：「沒有什麽這個那個，你到隔壁每天送報，不是便路嗎？」江鏡蓉道：「你們不是原有送報人嗎？只怕他不答應。老張媽道：」不相干！因為他送得太遲了，所以我們太太關照要你送。我們喜歡要誰送，就叫誰送，他怎麼可以不答應呢？」江鏡蓉道：「那未到月底沒有幾天了，到了下月初，由我送吧。」在江鏡蓉也算是個緩兵之計，好在他們要敎我送報，他們到底不知我是誰。那知老張媽去回報她太太時，恰巧葉誦芬在他媽身邊，老張媽就喜歡多說話，她道：「今天早晨，我已經給小送報的說了，他說從下月份送起。」停了一停，又道：「這個小送報的，年紀也和我們小少爺差不多，就出來送報了。」停了一停，又道：「這個小送報的，和從前來過的，我們小少爺的朋友，江家少爺的面孔，眞有點相似。不過江家少爺比他胖一點，他似乎瘦一點。」葉太太不曾留心，葉誦芬轉念頭了，他想：江鏡蓉，我寫了好幾封信給他，他老不答復。究竟進了那一家中學，也不吿訴我。聽說他家裏很窮，不要這送報的人，就是他嗎？（二三八）</p>

<h3>修改滸歌曲歌詞的建議</h3>
<p>— 陳述</p>
<p>歌曲對於社會的影響是很大的。它能深入民問，感化民衆，敎導民衆。筆者特地在這裏提出個關於修改流行歌曲歌辭的問題以作商討。目前所謂流行歌曲，大都是一種情歌，在一般靑年及兒童的心理上，種入了不少毒素，目前社會上許多不幸的情態，有許多是這種歌曲所促成的！</p>
<p>講到歌曲的所以能流行，大概不外具有二種原因：一是歌譜之動聽，一是歌詞的適合一般人的脾胃。拿現在流行的歌曲來講，我們可以看出目前一般人的旨趣是怎樣的低劣。關於這一層，實在還得歸咎於已往的歌唱界。這裏，應該要特別請目前歌唱界來負糾正的責任，另外，我還得向大家呼籲，要認識時代，認識每一份子的責任，幹快勘正已往錯誤的觀點！</p>
<p>不久以前，有人將「何日君再來」改為「何日君不來」，「蓮花落」改為「傷兵蓮花落」等，但這工作似乎不曾擴大。希望目前文化界和歌唱界共同來擔負這項工作；當然範圍不僅限於流行歌曲，不過因為易於着手和收效罷了。至於非流行歌曲，凡是無益的，有毒素的；都得同樣的來一體修正它！</p>
<p>或許有人要將目前的環境來答覆我這個提議，那末也儘可以將相當有用的不十分有抵觸性的改編進去。總之，我們應該用歌曲作為敎育工具，絕對不允許借它來麻醉人們，至於新歌的產生，更應嚴密注意，負責闢一光明坦道，如此則靡靡之音絕跡於孤島空間，於靑年兒童社會國家。誠有莫大之裨益。（酬移春禮勞軍）</p>
<h3>南華銀團影后　李綺年應聘藝華</h3>

<p>她現在和香港最享盛名的馬師曾趕拍一部「虎嘯枇杷巷」，這影片是以抗戰為背景，把戀愛作穿挿，此片將博得千萬影迷和輿論界的佳譽呢！</p>
<h3>京戲與話劇（六）</h3>
<p>有許多人說「京戲」沒有意義，不合潮流。也有許多人說「話劇」味同嚼蠟，旣不歌，又不舞，與其看話劇，不如到馬路上去看來來往往的男女老少。這兩種人同我講時，我總叫他們去多看幾回再說。愚見以為京戲與話劇，好的都好，不好的都小好，簡單地說，就是各有各的好處。我們在沒有研究某種藝術之前，最好不要輕易去批評，即使批評，也祗能說是個人的見解，千萬不可下肯定的斷語。因為一種藝術的成立，總有其獨特性，劇作者也總有一番苦心孤詣，不論其趣味是低級或高級，也總能獲得社會上一部份人的欣賞和同情，否則，即使沒有人去批評指摘，終須歸於天然淘汰也。</p>
<p>個人的意見，京劇的作風是寫意，話劇是寫實，京戲好比繪畫，話劇好比照相，但畫家不怕他寫意到什麽程度，總不能畫一個人祗生一隻眼睛倒長着兩隻嘴，攝影家不怕他寫實到什麼程度，總不至採取一只馬桶一只溺壺做他攝影的對象，這就是說，旣然稱謂一種蘇術，為眞也不能不顧到美的條件，反之，不合實情實理的美，也不能存在。</p>
<p>京戲與話劇，有兩點是同樣要下功夫研究的。第一點是說白，總要淸晰流利。因為要淸晰，就不得不研究求尖團平仄陰陽反切。因為要流利，就要熟練，要有抑揚頓挫，要分上下句，要疾徐有節。京戲裏面的說白，最忌是一順邊，或一道湯，又坤伶常易犯滿嘴尖字的毛病，在內家聽了，未免要毛骨悚然，就是外行聽了，雖然不敢下什麽批評，但也總覺得不順耳，或竟聽不懂，說句笑話，這不是對牛彈琴，簡直好比對人彈棉花，雖遇鍾子期，也莫測高山流水之志了。或者以為話劇的說白，總沒有這些窮講究了，我以為不然，話劇旣不重唱，說白豈不更重要嗎，况且話劇又偏重寫實，要不讓入聽出是怎麼回事，那末眞個味同嚼蠟了，我常聽見的毛病，王種是半南半北的國語，一種是像西洋人說耶穌般的調子，不過，幾個常飾主角的人，尤其是女主角，都沒有這種毛病，但是配角也不是不重要的吓。寫到這裏，忽然想起了十年前一椿舊事，有一位中學敎員，來同我接洽一件事情，我順便問他在貴校担任什麽功課，他說是担任鬼語，當時我也沒有想一想，很驚詫地就問他怎麽鬼還會說語麽，不想他意弄得面紅頸赤，我到此纔恍然大悟，原來先生將國字說別了音也。即此也可以證明說白字音的重要性。</p>
<p>再說第二點，就是表情，第一不可忽視劇中人的身份。第二要將當時喜怒哀樂的情緒顯示出來，最難表的是隱憂，佯歡，薄怒，喬醋，裝瘋等等，總不可把上一字忘記了，單表底下一個字。第三不要忽略了研究全劇人物的時代變遷關係，響如演全本雷峰塔，斷橋產子時的仕林，纔呱呱墮地，狀元祭塔時的仕林，已經長成二十許人了，白娘娘是仙家，我們不去管他，許仙官的姊姊和姊丈，難道也得了仙家的駐顏術了麼？其餘如敎子連演雙官誥，乾坤福壽鏡等一類的戲，不暇盡述，這在話劇，倒是很注意的。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Retreat on All Fronts in Southern Guangxi; Chinese Troops Press to the Northern Outskirts of Nanning; Casualties in the Battle of Binyang Exceed 20,000; Yamamoto Regiment Completely Annihilated, Regimental Commander Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Recent reports from the Chinese side claim that the vanguard of the Chinese army in southern Guangxi has reached the northern outskirts of Nanning. (Reuters dispatch, 15th) Chongqing: According to news received here today, prior to the Chinese army's recapture of Binyang in Guangxi, the Japanese Yamamoto Regiment was completely annihilated under the fierce assault of the Chinese army. Its regimental commander was also killed in action. One can imagine the intensity of the battle. The Yamamoto Regiment was originally stationed in the Sanshui area of Guangdong and was only recently transferred to the Nanning theater. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesperson stated this afternoon while meeting with reporters that Japanese troops in southern Guangxi are currently retreating on all fronts. This was decided when the main force of the Japanese army took extensive flanking action, initially launching from Nanning, crossing the Yu River, and advancing northwest to Binyang, eventually reaching Shanglin (northwest of Binyang). Thereupon, the Chinese army attacked from the northwest, northeast, and southeast, forcing them to retreat towards Nanning. Since the highway southeast of Binyang was under Chinese army control, the retreating Japanese troops had to struggle through narrow mountain paths to return to Nanning. With the main force of the Japanese army having suffered defeat, the Japanese troops in Wuming, Silong, and south of Kunlun Pass all had to retreat towards Nanning. The Chinese army in Wuming, after fierce fighting at Shuangqiao, has advanced to Dagao Peak (north of Nanning). Japanese casualties in the Battle of Binyang exceeded 20,000. Chinese losses were also considerable. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesperson today, in the past week, intense fighting occurred only in Suiyuan and Guangxi. There has been little activity in northern Guangdong, southern Shanxi, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi. There have been only minor battles in northern Hubei and southern Henan. In Suiyuan and Guangxi, the Chinese army's strategy of flanking maneuvers has proven successful, leading to the recapture of many cities that had fallen into Japanese hands and inflicting significant blows on the Japanese. In Guangxi, the Japanese launched a four-pronged attack in the past week. One route attacked towards Wuming, suffering a major blow from the Chinese side. The Japanese troops on that route are now attempting to block the Chinese army's advance on the northern part of Nanning. The other three routes were the left, center, and right routes taken by the Japanese against Binyang, each with a division of troops. The left and right routes were completely routed due to the Chinese army's semi-circular flanking and counter-offensive strategy. Only the central route remains, still stalled west of Kunlun Pass. In total, the Japanese losses in the Binyang campaign exceed 20,000. Before this offensive, the Japanese forces in the Nanning area numbered five divisions. Currently, only three and a half divisions remain. As for the Japanese troops in the Wuyuan and Baotou areas, because their rear lines of communication, highways, and railways are constantly under attack by the Chinese army, they will also likely face total collapse. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Qianjiang: The Binyang area has previously been ravaged, with thousands of civilians killed. In Liaopingxu, Lianhuaxu, Dengxu, and other places east of Binyang, the Japanese forcibly conscripted 2,000 civilians to transport ammunition. Most have now returned home. (Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: The Japanese troops who invaded north from Yongning, after suffering over 20,000 casualties at the hands of the Chinese forces, have scattered among the mountain villages. After continuous searches by the Chinese army, a great number have been killed. Currently, there are no traces of the Japanese in the Silong and Gaotian areas. The bodies of Japanese soldiers are scattered all over the southwest of Binyang, and the Chinese army is in the process of burying them. (Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: The Japanese Yamamoto Regiment was recently transferred from Sanshui to reinforce southern Guangxi. In the Battle of Binyang, the entire regiment was annihilated by the Chinese army, and its regimental commander, Colonel Yamamoto, was also killed. (Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Fancheng: A unit of Japanese troops from Maping, accompanied by several artillery pieces, launched an attack on the Chinese army on the 10th. After a fierce engagement, the Japanese suffered extremely heavy losses and retreated. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue them, and near Zhangjiamiao, they were ambushed from both sides. The Japanese army panicked and fled back to Maping. In this battle, the Japanese left behind more than 300 corpses. (Dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Foreign Mission Confirms Japanese Planes Attacked Hanzhong Last Year; German Broadcast of News That Chinese Planes Attacked Hanzhong Proven Unfounded</h3>
<p>Chongqing: It is reported that a formal document has been received here from the Italian Catholic Church in Hanzhong, southern Shaanxi, confirming that the bombing of the city on two occasions last October was indeed carried out by Japanese planes and not Chinese planes. The previous claim that Chinese planes carried out the bombing was incorrect. According to the document, two months after the air raids, a German radio station broadcast news from Rome stating that Chinese planes bombed the buildings of the Catholic Church in Hanzhong on October 25th and 30th. A certain reliable news agency received this news and, without investigating its veracity, immediately forwarded it to the world. Upon reading this, the Church immediately wrote to the local Chinese authorities to prove the falsity of this claim. The Church also requested the Italian government to protest to the Japanese government regarding the indiscriminate destruction of third-country property by the Japanese. It is reported that on October 25th, 35 Japanese planes bombed Hanzhong, killing 83 people, injuring 70 people, and destroying approximately 200 houses. On October 30th, Japanese planes attacked the city again, dropping 80 bombs, killing and injuring 10 people. The Church's buildings were damaged in both attacks. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane Shot Down in Yunnan Recovered</h3>
<p>Kunming: A Japanese plane was met head-on and attacked by the Chinese Air Force over Kaiyuan yesterday afternoon. The Japanese formation was immediately thrown into disarray. One plane, the squadron leader, was shot down by the Chinese and crashed in Qijiaotang, south of Wenshan. The wreckage has been found, but the plane was destroyed and the crew killed. Two other planes were seriously damaged. Upon receiving the report, officials were immediately dispatched to transport the wreckage to Kunming for display. (Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to French sources here, the Dian-Vietnam Railway was bombed by Japanese planes on Tuesday but was not damaged, and the bridges were not hit. Chinese sources criticized the Japanese claim that a Japanese bomber "descended rapidly towards the bridges regardless of danger," saying that the plane crashed at Wen Shan (transliteration), about fifteen miles from the bridge. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Fellow Hunan Provincials in Hubei Support the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Hubei Hunan Provincial Association and the Wuhan Hunan Public Property Management Committee recently sent a telegram from an undisclosed location, stating that they respectfully lead 26,000 fellow Hunan provincials in Hubei in sincerely supporting the President to complete the great cause of the War of Resistance and national reconstruction. (Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Journalists Inspect Wuyuan Area</h3>
<p>Beiping: A group of foreign journalists, including a Reuters reporter, accompanied a Japanese military spokesman to Wuyuan to observe the fighting and returned to Beiping today. They traveled in six Fokker monoplanes. The reporters saw a long line of Japanese transport vehicles and one or two tanks near Wuyuan. This was part of the Japanese army that had retreated from Wuyuan after the battle in Inner Mongolia. The garrison defending Wuyuan is thin, with several field artillery pieces deployed at Dalukou. The city is extremely impoverished, with only one or two brick buildings among the humble mud houses. The residents rely on wool for a living and serve as a stop for camel caravans. Few Chinese were seen along the way, as all the residents had fled before the Japanese occupation. The small shops in the narrow, dirty streets were all empty, making the desolation indescribable. When the planes flew over Wucheng, the site of the recent battle north of Wuyuan, it became clear why the Chinese army could not firmly resist the Japanese army in that area. To the south, there is a mountain range and the Yellow River, but the rest of the area is all plains with no cover. In addition, although the Japanese army attacked with only 10,000 men against 30,000 Chinese troops, they were fully mechanized and far better equipped than the Chinese army. The Chinese army had only about 28 howitzers and several mortars, in addition to rifles and machine guns, and no new-style weapons. Throughout the entire trip, a continuous range of mountains was in sight, with peaks and ridges connected, capped with white snow. Sometimes the mountains were shrouded in white clouds. When the weather was clear, the scenery viewed from the air was extremely magnificent. Even at an altitude of 7,000 feet, the mountains seemed to be very close. There was not a single stream that was not frozen. There were very few living creatures to be seen. On the return trip, they flew over Nankou and Zhangjiakou on the Great Wall.

<h3>The Positive Significance of US Actions Toward Japan</h3>
<p>In recent days, the various actions of the United States have gradually answered the question of what the United States will do after the abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce. Of course, this answer is not a complete solution but rather the beginning of an answer. Everyone feels it is not very satisfying but still quite satisfactory. Proceeding step by step, firmly and steadily, this is the consistent policy of the United States internationally, the unique style of American diplomacy!</p>
<p>The United States has recently decided on: First, to increase the capital of the Export-Import Bank by 100 million US dollars, mainly for the reason of providing further loans of 20 million US dollars each to China and Finland. Second, to expand the navy, allocating 655 million US dollars to realize its two-year shipbuilding plan, mainly to establish its absolute superiority in the Pacific. Third, to temporarily postpone the bill to abolish the Treasury Department's power to purchase foreign silver, one of the reasons being concern that it would be detrimental to China. Fourth, to temporarily postpone the ban on exports to Japan, the main explanation being to allow the State Department to observe the evolution of the situation. In addition to these four points, (1) the ban on the export of arms to Japan is being promoted; (2) the establishment of naval and air bases in Guam and other places in the Pacific, as well as in Alaska and other bridgeheads between the Americas, is under consideration; (3) public opinion polls show that support for prohibiting the shipment of military supplies to Japan has increased to 70 percent; and (4) Undersecretary of State Welles has been ordered to visit Europe, reportedly to exchange views with British authorities on the Far East policies of the United Kingdom and the United States. All of this vividly portrays the attitude of the United States in dealing with the changing situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>The strength of US international policy lies in adhering to its principles of fairness, meticulously and progressively, while still leaving room in time for the other party to make adjustments and adapt to fairness. After the "August 13th Incident" in 1937, it constantly and diligently enlightened Japan. At the end of 1938, it gave Japan a comprehensive and stern memorandum. In June 1939, it announced the limited-term abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce. In January of this year, before the treaty actually expired, Ambassador Grew gave a sincere and insightful speech three months in advance. And now, it is beginning to take concrete actions. In fact, Japan cannot resist the pressure from the United States. In terms of time, Japan has ample room to repent and change its course. We observe from the sidelines and deeply feel that Japan has unfortunately failed to take advantage of this room to maintain its honor. Instead, it has responded with all sorts of vulgar roars, childish threats, and enticements with flattery and petty gains. This is of course ignored by the United States and only serves to prove Japan's lack of remorse and lack of sincerity.</p>
<p>Recent US actions have made those in Japan who are rational and truly patriotic understand the true intentions of the United States and better understand Japan's crisis. However, these actions, which are not entirely satisfactory, are not enough to prompt the madmen to quickly regain their senses. Not only that, but they will also cause the madmen to intensify their pursuit of the delusions they yearn for, believing that the United States is giving them room in time to pursue their delusions, and that Japan only needs to seize and oppress in China to prepare for catching up later and competing with the United States in expanding its navy. These kinds of delusions naturally have some impact on the United States. However, we are also free to understand that the reason why the United States' actions cannot be completely satisfactory is because of political reasons. Moreover, the actions of the United States and China's long-term war of resistance strategy coincide. The day that China wins the war of resistance is also the day that the United States gets rid of Japan's delusions.</p>
<p>Originally, China only expects one of two outcomes from Japan: one is Japan's complete repentance, voluntarily abandoning its aggression, and then re-establishing diplomatic relations on the principle of absolute equality; the other is Japan's complete defeat, with its financial and military power collapsing to the point that it can no longer covet China, submitting to international norms. Therefore, the gains and losses of the war of resistance have never been measured by the advance or retreat of the battle lines, but by the magnitude of Japan's power being consumed. Now that the war has reached this point, the military offensives that Japan has adopted during its political season to quell its parliament, whether in Suiyuan, Guangxi, or even western Zhejiang, have all exposed that it is stretched thin and has already reached the end of its strength. What China boasts of is not the recapture of Linhe in Suiyuan or the counter-offensive against Nanning in Guangxi, but the increasingly obvious and significant effect of the long-term attrition strategy! Who does not love peace, who does not have a subconscious desire for a temporary respite? Therefore, expecting Japan to completely repent is a natural human feeling. However, when considering the extraordinary shame and humiliation, and the pain of the blood debts, it is better to expect Japan to be completely defeated than to expect Japan to completely repent. These two outcomes are for Japan to choose itself. The longer the madness lasts and the more cruel the aggression, the more tragic and thorough the defeat will be. This is an inevitable truth.</p>
<p>Judging from this perspective, the actions of the United States, giving China another loan of 20 million US dollars, is truly a drop in the bucket for the United States. Comparing 20 million US dollars to US-Japan trade last year, it is only one-eleventh of US exports to Japan (over 230 million) and one-eighth of Japanese exports to the US (over 160 million). It is also only two-sevenths of the US trade surplus with Japan. Trade is of great benefit to Japan's aggression, so it is not necessary to compliment the United States for being generous. At the same time, 20 million US dollars, combined with the current actual exchange rate, is nearly 260 million Chinese legal tender, which is not a small amount. It will certainly be of great benefit to China's war of resistance in terms of morale and material resources. However, compared to what China has sacrificed in the war of resistance, it is only enough to compensate for a very small part. However, in terms of the overall situation and the impact of interests, not only should we place a different value on this 10 million US dollar loan, but we should also add a certain meaning to the United States' not immediately prohibiting exports to Japan. Because China only seeks to continue the war of resistance, with the ambition to fight for the final victory with its last drop of blood. Now, far before the last drop of blood, there is an increase of 260 million yuan of foreign new strength! This is something that cannot be despised under any standards. No wonder Japan exclaimed that this was serious. In Japan, after the abrogation of the US-Japan Treaty of Commerce, the United States did not immediately prohibit exports to Japan. Although on the one hand it seems that Japan still has room to purchase goods in the US market, on the other hand, it is also that the United States is leaving this gateway open to absorb Japan's gold and silver, to accelerate the process of Japan reducing its blood loss and exhaustion, so that Japan, in addition to military failure, will eventually collapse economically due to the outflow of gold and silver. This cannot be regarded as reaching the same goal by different paths as China's long-term attrition strategy.</p>
<p>Although the actions of the United States are not entirely satisfactory, and although the ban on the export of military supplies to Japan is supported by 70 percent of the American people but has not yet been established, the current actions have positive significance and will have good effects, which cannot be denied.</p>
<h3>US Senate Foreign Relations Committee Temporarily Postpones Discussion of Embargo Against Japan; Anti-Japanese Sentiment Among Senators Remains High; State Department Watches Developments</h3>
<p>Washington: Yesterday's actions in Congress have made it clear here that the second step of the United States in the Far East is to provide economic assistance to China, while using naval expansion to pressure Japan without "sanctions." The most important of Congress's actions is that the US loan to China will be discussed directly by the House of Representatives without going through two committees. Also, the House is now prepared to consider the issue of fortifying Guam and other locations in the Pacific. Anti-Japanese sentiment in Congress is extremely high, but congressional leaders are asking all parties to act with caution. The official here has refused to comment on a proposal put forward in the Japanese parliament about the US and Japan convening a conference in the Pacific. (United Press dispatch, 15th) Washington: At its meeting today, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee proposed a study of the issue of commercially restricting Japan. After an hour of debate, it was decided to temporarily postpone discussion of various measures. At the same time, a date for discussion was not set for a bill proposed by Committee Chairman Pittman, which advocated prohibiting certain goods from being shipped to Japan. Most committee members believe that US-Japan relations should be maintained in their current state for the time being, allowing the State Department to watch the evolution of the situation. Observers here say that if Japan adopts new discriminatory measures against the United States, it will be intolerable to US senators and will undoubtedly lead to a re-examination of the issue and a demand for discussion of sanctions against Japan. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington: The US Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced yesterday that the US has decided to temporarily postpone the embargo against Japan until it is known whether the Senate-passed loan to China will create a further relationship between the United States and the Far East. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee discussed Senator Connally and Senator McKellar's proposals to ban the export of military supplies to Japan for several hours yesterday. Senator Connally and Senator McKellar declared that "we have fired empty cartridges and then retrieved them." Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman believed that postponing the embargo did not mean that he did not want to discuss it at this meeting. "About four-fifths of the people on this committee are not very familiar with the contents of this proposal," Pittman declared, "In fact, they still need an opportunity to study it." A subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will hold an ad hoc meeting to discuss the application of neutrality legislation to the Sino-Japanese War and the Soviet-Finnish conflict.

<h3>US House Naval Affairs Committee Passes Naval Expansion Budget Totaling $655,500,000 USD; 21 Warships to be Built in Two Years</h3>
<p>Washington - The House Appropriations Committee yesterday approved a Naval budget of $966,772,878. The Naval Affairs Committee also reviewed and passed a separate naval expansion plan today, totaling $655,000,000. It proposes to begin construction of 21 warships of various sizes within two years. This includes three aircraft carriers, each with a higher tonnage than current models, as well as several cruisers and submarines, and 22 auxiliary warships. The number of naval aircraft is to be increased from the current 3,000 to at least 4,500. Before the vote, the Naval Affairs Committee presented and read a letter from Secretary of the Navy Edison, stating that, in the view of the Navy Department, a three-year plan by Mother Neff to increase naval expenditures to $1,300,000,000 would have a very positive psychological impact on the international situation. However, Chairman Vincent of the Naval Affairs Committee believed that a two-year plan was more suited to the existing construction capacity of US shipyards. If necessary in the future, Congress could still increase the number of ships built. As a result of the discussion, the Naval Affairs Committee ultimately heeded Chairman Vincent's request and passed the naval expansion plan. (Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Washington - When President Roosevelt submitted the budget proposal for the next fiscal year to Congress, he requested an appropriation of $15 million to purchase various raw materials necessary for the arms industry, especially manganese, tin, and rubber. After discussion in the House of Representatives, it was decided to reduce the amount to $12.5 million. Subsequently, the Senate Appropriations Committee also agreed. President Roosevelt then sent a letter to the President of the Senate, Vice President Garner, and Speaker of the House Bankhead today, maintaining the original amount of $15 million, requesting immediate approval, and, based on the report submitted by the joint committee of various departments, reiterated the necessity of immediately purchasing and storing these materials.

<h3>British Newspaper Comments on the Bleak Future of Japanese Military Operations in China</h3>
<p>London - The Manchester Guardian stated today that it is now certain that Japan no longer expects to achieve victory through decisive battles or territorial acquisition. Japan's hope lies entirely in China eventually succumbing to exhaustion and internal division, thus begging Japan for peace. China's suffering is indeed great, but the Chinese authorities and people are now very different from before, and they remain united regardless of Japan's actions. Japan believes that what cannot be achieved by military force can be achieved by political means. The plan itself is simple: General Chiang Kai-shek surrenders, and Wang Jingwei becomes Japan's tool for establishing a new order in East Asia. The difficulty is that this plan seems to have little relation to reality. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Newspapers Attack the United States</h3>
<p>Tokyo - The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" commented yesterday that the US protests regarding Japanese military actions in China are "trivial matters," and that one must doubt the common sense of the nation making such protests. The "Asahi Shimbun" stated that Japan's attempt to adjust Japanese-American relations has been deadlocked due to "American obstinacy and prejudice." The newspaper concluded by saying that the future of Japanese-American relations is very serious. (Associated Press Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Guo Taiqi Delivers Speech in England: China, Britain, and the United States Should Closely Cooperate to Establish a New World Order</h3>
<p>London - Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi recently delivered a speech at the National Liberal Club in England, stating: "There is currently no so-called European war, nor is there a so-called Asian war; there is only a world war. In other words, whether it is the war that you have just participated in in Europe or the war that my country has been fully engaged in in Asia, it is the same war waged by the same hostile forces. There is a dangerous notion that if the European problem is solved first, then other problems can be easily resolved. I would first like to express my disagreement because no European solution, no matter how perfect, can solve any problem alone, not even the problems of Europeans can be completely solved. I recall that the Chinese people issued an appeal eight years ago, stating that if the Manchurian Incident could find a just solution, the entire world could be peaceful for at least several decades." This view is closer to the truth. "For the sake of the vital interests that you hold, the importance of the Chinese coast is no less than that of the Baltic Sea or the Balkans." Moreover, the Pacific problem is essentially the China problem and has a significant impact on the relations between Britain and the United States. If Britain and the United States can cooperate sincerely in the Far East, they will be able to establish the greatest coordination in other areas. Thus, it can be seen that China can become the key to the satisfactory resolution of all problems. It is hoped that the first contribution of China, Britain, and the United States to the mission of establishing a new world order will be to abandon prejudice, fully understand each other, and closely cooperate. This is not only fortunate for China, but also fortunate for all English-speaking nations. (Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>France and Japan Hold Opposing Views on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Bombing Incident; France Unwilling to Renew Trade Agreement with Japan Until the Issue is Resolved</h3>
<p>Paris - Japanese Ambassador to France Renzo Sawada submitted a memorandum to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, attempting to persuade France to recognize "large-scale hostile acts in China" in order to induce France to adopt a more definite neutrality in the Sino-Japanese war. Japan obviously wants France to issue a formal statement indicating that France will not allow China to use the assistance of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to fight against Japan. The general impression here is that the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway does not transport munitions, but munitions or supplies are transported from Vietnam to China. The French side admits that trucks, gasoline, and other supplies are imported into China via the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, but they insist that trucks, gasoline, and other supplies cannot be classified as munitions. It is reported that France and Japan will continue to exchange political views, but France is unwilling to renew the Franco-Japanese trade agreement until the issue of the Japanese bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway is resolved. The current trade agreement will expire on March 15. (Associated Press Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>A Comparison of US and Japanese Naval Strength</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Ito, a well-known Japanese naval affairs commentator, recently published an article in the Asahi Shimbun comparing the naval strengths of the United States and Japan. He stated that after the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, the US Navy possessed fifteen battleships, but lacked auxiliary warships. All of its light cruisers and destroyers were nearing the end of their service lives, and its light cruisers were particularly inferior to Japan's. Therefore, although the US fleet was large, it lacked balance and could not operate far from the ocean, and was not sufficient to threaten Japan. Thus, although the total tonnage of the US and Japanese navies was in a ratio of five to three, in reality, it should be four to five, with Japan having the advantage. However, since 1933, the United States has actively expanded its navy, and the warships built are the most modern in the world. It is expected that by 1942, the United States will possess a fleet with an appropriate tonnage, totaling 1.6 million tons, with 300 warships of various sizes, including six new battleships and many new submarines with a range of 15,000 to 17,000 nautical miles, and 100 new destroyers with a range of 6,000 nautical miles. With regard to destroyers, the US believes that they are superior to Japan's "Fubuki" class destroyers (Note: The Fubuki has a displacement of 1,700 tons, a speed of 34 knots, and is equipped with six 5-inch guns and nine torpedo tubes). However, the cost of each US warship is 20 million yen, comparable to the cost of Japan's battleship Yamashiro, which is also true. In short, once the US fleet replenishes fuel at Wake Island or Midway Island in the Pacific Ocean by 1942, it can approach the Sea of Japan and wage a "week-long war." However, the US naval authorities still believe that this is not enough. Chairman Vincent of the House Naval Affairs Committee proposed a naval expansion plan on January 3 of this year, calling for the construction of an additional 400,000 tons of new ships, which is the fourth expansion since 1933. As a result of the previous three expansions, the strength of the US Navy is sufficient to defend its own country, but after the fourth expansion plan is implemented, it will become an extremely powerful fleet that can be used to attack other countries. This will threaten Japan and force it to respond. Regarding this issue, Naval Minister Vice Admiral Yoshida issued a statement to the House of Representatives on the 10th of this month, saying that although the warship construction program from 1937 to 1939 was kept secret, he had carefully studied it and believed that it would be sufficient, at least temporarily, to cope with the two recent Vincent plans in the United States.

<h3>Soviet Red Star Newspaper Comments on the Situation of China's War of Resistance; The Success of the Chinese Army's Counteroffensive at the Beginning of the Year is Based on the Success of Rear Area Construction</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Red Star newspaper today published an article discussing the military and economic successes of the Chinese side, entitled "China's New Economic and Military Base." The article stated: "A characteristic of the year 1940 is the smooth progress of the Chinese army's counteroffensive against the Japanese army. This victory is largely due to China's abundant industrial and military raw materials and the success of the industrialization of China's rear base. In addition, China's economic strength will enable China to become an independent and free country and achieve victory in the war. The National Government of China and all the Chinese people are now working hard to build the economy with a spirit of great courage. In this regard, China has achieved great success. Previously economically backward provinces have now produced large-scale industries and become wartime economic bases. This success and the enthusiastic support of all the Chinese people will enable the National Government to achieve further progress in building domestic industry, greatly assisting the war of liberation."

<h3>German Government Statement on the Panama Declaration; If Britain and France Do Not Change Their Attitudes, the Safety Zone Plan Cannot Be Effectively Implemented; German Foreign Minister's Reply to Panama</h3>
<p>Switzerland - After the Pan-American Conference decided in October last year in Panama City to demarcate neutral zones around the Americas, the governments of the American countries, led by the government of Panama, jointly sent notes to the European belligerent countries, asking them to respect them. Later, after the German pocket battleship "Admiral Graf Spee" scuttled itself in Uruguayan waters, notes were again sent to the respective countries lodging protests. It has been learned that the German government has sent a reply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Panama. (Havas Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Regarding the proposal for an American safety zone, the German government submitted a note to Panama yesterday, explaining the German government's position. The original text is as follows: "The President of Panama, representing the American countries, telegraphed the German head of state on October 4, 1939, informing him of the full text of the so-called Panama Declaration, the purpose of which is to protect the rights and interests of the neutral countries of the Americas from being harmed by the current European war. Therefore, it is proposed to establish a safety zone within certain limits of territorial waters in the Americas, in which no belligerent country may engage in acts of war. The governments of the American countries agree that they will endeavor to have the belligerent countries recognize the zone. On December 24, 1939, the Vice President of Panama issued another telegram, in which he raised a number of events that were considered to be efforts endangering the safety of the Americas, and stated that the American countries had lodged protests with the belligerent countries regarding the above-mentioned events. At the same time, the American countries also held meetings with each other to discuss how to strengthen their defense organizations. After receiving the above-mentioned two telegrams, the German head of state replied on October 23 and December 29, respectively, expressing his willingness to examine this issue. As a result of the examination, we hereby notify your country of the following facts and request that they be relayed to other American countries: (1) The German government welcomes the determination expressed by the American countries in the Panama Declaration to maintain absolute neutrality in the existing European war and understands their hope to keep their people unaffected by the war. (2) The German government shares the same view as the American countries that the establishment of a safety zone is tantamount to changing existing international law. The German government does not believe that international law should remain unchanged, but rather that international law should be adapted to the emergence of new circumstances and changed accordingly. Based on this spirit, the German government is willing to consider the proposals of the neutral countries of the Americas, but it must be stated that until the Panama Declaration is recognized by both belligerent countries, German warships will only know how to abide by international law. The German Navy's past activities have strictly adhered to this law and have not dared to overstep it. Therefore, the protests lodged by the American countries with Germany are in fact a groundless step. (3) When considering the safety zone issue, there is an important point: Germany and other belligerent countries have different positions. That is, Germany has never had territorial ambitions for the American continent, while Britain and France have acquired military territories and bases in the Americas in the past hundred years. This fact, which changes the Monroe Doctrine to the benefit of Britain and France, fundamentally calls into question the success of the safety zone plan. Even if Britain and France guarantee that they will not use the territories as bases for war, Canada, as the territory of a belligerent country, still lies between the safety zones. (4) Nevertheless, Germany is still willing to consider how to implement the Panama Declaration, but from various telegrams and newspaper reports, it seems that Britain and France do not value the safety zone plan. They only ask the American countries not to allow German warships to enter, while British and French warships can pass unhindered. This not only violates the neutrality of the American countries, but also fundamentally overturns the basic principles of international law. (5) Based on the above points, although the German government is very willing to consider the safety plan proposed by the American countries, it is convinced that only if Britain and France fundamentally revise their recently published views can the safety zone plan be expected to succeed. Signed by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop." (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Romania Conscripts Reservists</h3>
<p>Geneva - French newspapers today published a statement from the Romanian Embassy in France stating that all reservists of the 1941 class, i.e., citizens born in Romania in 1922, must report for duty between February 15 and 25. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>British Reinforcements in the Near East Arouse Italian Suspicion; Italian Newspapers Point Out Disruption of Mediterranean Balance of Power; Britain Uses Egypt as Important Military Base</h3>
<p>Rome - The Allied military strength in the Near East has aroused suspicion among political figures here since the dispatch of Australian and New Zealand troops. Regarding the explanation in British newspapers that Britain's dispatch of troops to the Near East does not intend to expand the scope of the war, but only to protect transportation routes such as the Iraq oil fields and the Suez Canal, and has no other purpose, people here express doubt about this. The "Tribune" commented, "The balance of power in the Mediterranean has now been disrupted by Britain's dispatch of troops to the Near East, and at the same time it is in conflict with the Anglo-Italian agreement to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean. Although Britain guarantees that it does not intend to expand the scope of the war, judging from the rumor spread by the British news agency that Germany will invade the Netherlands, Britain seems to be making the situation increasingly complicated." (Haitong Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Cairo - The current Egypt can be called the largest military training ground for Britain and France, and it is also an important military base for Britain and France. After this base, British and French troops can be sent to the Balkans or the Caucasus, depending on the situation of the war. In addition, troops from the British Empire, such as Australia, New Zealand, and India, are stationed here before being sent to Europe. New Zealand troops are now stationed in the Egyptian desert, planning to move to the Western Front when the weather in Europe is slightly warmer, while Australian troops will be sent to Palestine. During my two weeks of observation in Egypt, I was deeply impressed by the full military preparations made by Britain and France here. I feel that in all respects, the senior commanders of Britain, France, and Egypt are cooperating sincerely. In the past two weeks, Egyptian King Farouk, French Commander of the Near East Weygand, British Commander of the Middle East Wavell, British Commander of the Mediterranean Fleet Cunningham, and other naval and military leaders have repeatedly held tripartite negotiations to discuss various issues of cooperation. (Associated Press Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - The Turkish Ambassador to Britain told British Foreign Secretary Halifax today that the Soviet Union is now engaged in the construction of defensive fortifications along the Turkish border. It is also reported that the two sides discussed the situation in the Near East and the Middle East, especially the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea regions. It is said that Turkey is very concerned about the rumored closer cooperation between the Soviet Union and Germany. It is said that the reason why the Soviet Union is actively defending in the Caucasus is due to the concentration of large British and French forces in the Near East and the Middle East. At the same time, Britain and France's active assistance to Finland and the Nordic countries, increasing troops in the Near East, and attempting to improve relations with Japan are all aimed at threatening the Soviet Union.

<h3>Eden Arrives in Palestine to Comfort Australian Troops</h3>
<p>Jerusalem - Dominion Secretary Eden arrived in Palestine by plane from Cairo today, planning to spend a day touring the Australian troops' camps and offering his condolences. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London - Reuters' exploration of Dominion Secretary Eden's visit to Egypt revealed that he conveyed King George VI's sincere condolences to Egyptian King Farouk. According to the Egyptian Al-Ahram newspaper, the Egyptian Prime Minister said that in King George VI's letter, he expressed his regret that the outbreak of war had prevented him and the Queen from accepting the invitation of the King and Queen of Egypt to visit England, and expressed his gratitude for Egypt's past and present cooperation and assistance to Britain. He concluded by saying that he believed that the righteous principles of the allied countries would eventually prevail. (Reuters Dispatch, 15th) Jerusalem - A new batch of Australian Federal Expeditionary Forces has recently arrived in Palestine. Although the region has not implemented compulsory conscription, the soldiers of the expeditionary force have received good training and are of excellent quality, and most of them were originally members of the militia. At present, the number of Australian troops stationed in various parts of the Near East has reached 100,000, which is more than the number of Australian troops who participated in the last European war.

<h3>Cabinet Crisis Occurs in Bulgaria; Cabinet Resigns En Masse</h3>
<p>Sofia - Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Georgi Kyoseivanov recently submitted the cabinet's resignation en masse to King Boris III, which was immediately accepted by the King. (Havas Dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>Sofia - The Kyoseivanov cabinet resigned en masse today. According to well-informed sources, recently, Agriculture Minister Atanas Atanasov and Prime Minister Kyoseivanov held opposing views on the issue of parliamentary salaries. Although other cabinet members mediated, they failed to reach an agreement. This is the cause of the cabinet crisis. Another theory is that Bulgarian Minister to Yugoslavia Popov was recalled home by telegram yesterday, and the cabinet's resignation is not unrelated to his sudden return. (Havas)</p>

<h3>Churchill's Statement: Fully Arming Merchant Ships to Resist Brutal Sea Attacks; Defense Plan in Constant Implementation</h3>
<p>London - British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill, in response to a question in the House of Commons last night regarding measures to protect fishing boats, stated that they are constantly engaged in implementing defense plans and measures, which can only be judged by their results. He hoped that within a very short period, a large-scale protection plan would be implemented for those working in the North Sea. Attacks on unarmed small boats were, of course, unexpected, but at present, any small boat must have sufficient armament to resist such brutal attacks. A Member of Parliament asked why five German merchant ships loading cargo in Rotterdam were able to escape without being detected by the British. Churchill replied that the information received by the House of Commons did not match that received by the Admiralty. However, the House should know that the coastlines of the Netherlands and Germany are adjacent. Another Member of Parliament asked if the First Lord was satisfied with the effectiveness of maritime patrols. Churchill replied that no one who knows about the great development of the air force since the last war would expect the British Navy to maintain close patrols or a close blockade off the German coast. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>London - During this afternoon's session of the House of Commons, Labor MP Mr. Aitchison inquired whether, since German aircraft have repeatedly bombed British merchant ships and massacred innocent sailors, the British government would not send ships to rescue enemy pilots when they were shot down at sea by the British. First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill immediately replied that although German pilots have repeatedly bombed and machine-gunned British sailors, British ships will still rescue German pilots adrift at sea. "This is based on the inherent compassion of mankind." (Cheers from MPs.) Furthermore, the government will take all measures to protect British merchant ships so that they can sail safely in dangerous areas, and each ship will be equipped with sufficient armament to resist attacks. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - British First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill declared in the House of Commons yesterday that all British North Sea merchant ships would be fully armed within six weeks, which is the best way to protect British sailors in dangerous areas. (Haitong, 15th)</p>

<p>Oslo - After the Danish merchant ship "Marask" (5,177 tons) was sunk by a German submarine in the North Sea, 80 miles off the Norwegian coast, its 30 crew members were rescued thanks to the assistance of a British aircraft. The British plane spotted the crew members floating at sea in small boats and immediately notified a Norwegian ship to come to their rescue. The "Marask" was loaded with fertilizer from Morocco and was returning to Denmark when it was intercepted by a German submarine. The submarine ordered the crew to immediately lower the lifeboats, and then fired 27 shells at the ship, sinking it. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>London - The Swedish ship "Daralos" (3,927 tons) was attacked by a German submarine in a certain area of the Atlantic Ocean on the 12th. First, a torpedo was fired, and then cannon fire was used to sink it. The shipowner died on the spot. The 29 crew members drifted at sea for 17 hours before being rescued by a Belgian fishing boat and landed in an Irish port. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Oslo - Local newspapers report that Norway may have to notify Germany, stating that if Germany is not prepared to guarantee the lives of sailors, then Norwegian sailors will not be interested in continuing trade relations with Germany. One newspaper commented on Germany's recent sinking of neutral ships, saying that if Germany continues to conduct maritime warfare in this way, neutral countries will have to change their attitude towards Germany.

<h3>Karelian Isthmus Front: Soviet and Finnish Troops Engage in Hand-to-Hand Combat; Although Some Strongholds Have Been Captured, the Mannerheim Line Remains Unaffected</h3>
<p>Helsinki - Last night, a public communiqué reported on the continued fierce attacks by Soviet troops, stating that the Soviet troops had captured some Finnish strongholds in front of the Finnish lines in the Suvanto area, but their deep advance had been blocked by Finnish supporting strongholds. Elsewhere, the Soviet offensive was repulsed with heavy losses. Thousands of enemy corpses and dozens of tank wrecks were abandoned in front of the Finnish lines. The battle is currently underway. Northeast of Lake Ladoga, the Finnish army has crushed the Soviet army's attempt to advance and destroyed several of their tanks. A large unit of Soviet soldiers was annihilated in the Kumo (central Finland) area, and several machine gun nests were destroyed. Reconnaissance troops were also quite active elsewhere. The communiqué also mentioned Finnish air operations on Tuesday, stating that Finnish aircraft continued to bomb Soviet troop concentrations and fortifications with considerable effect. Yesterday, Soviet aircraft attacked Finnish towns, and Viitassari was also bombed. It is estimated that hundreds of Soviet aircraft were active in Finland that day. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Regarding the fighting on the Karelian Isthmus front, the Finnish General Headquarters admitted that the Red Army had captured some strongholds but believed that the Red Army's breakthrough had no significant consequences. The defensive strength of the Mannerheim Line was not affected in any way. Some of the tanks used by the Red Army in the offensive weighed up to 70 tons. Initially, when the Finnish troops suddenly saw the huge objects, they were somewhat frightened, but they soon discovered that the armor of these tanks was not strong enough to withstand the firepower of flat-trajectory guns, so they no longer considered them a concern. At this moment, the Red Army in the Karelian region is sparing no effort to continuously reinforce its troops and launch repeated attacks, but the Finnish army is still fighting bravely. As for the area along Lake Ladoga and the Gulf of Finland, the Red Army is taking advantage of the frozen ground to launch offensives, but they have been repulsed by the Finnish artillery. The situation on that front can be said to be completely in favor of the Finnish army, and its encirclement tactics are quite successful. In addition, the Finnish positions on the northern Kumo front have also been further consolidated. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - Today, hand-to-hand combat continues in Karelia. Although the Finnish side does not deny the severity of the positions there, they show no signs of panic. It is claimed that the Soviet army has suffered 250,000 casualties in two and a half months of fighting, and the only result has been the capture of outposts on the outer edge of the Mannerheim Line. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Yesterday, the fierce Soviet offensive in Karelia showed signs of weakening slightly. However, fierce hand-to-hand combat took place in the trenches. According to the Finnish General Headquarters, the intensity of the fighting in the Summa area surpassed any battle in the World War. The corpses of Soviet soldiers are piled up like mountains in front of the Finnish lines, and the Finnish side has also suffered considerable losses. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>Moscow - According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, on the 14th, there were continued fierce infantry and artillery actions in several areas of the front. In the Karelian region, Soviet troops are operating successfully. Enemy attacks against Soviet troops are unable to resist and are forced to retreat, suffering heavy losses. As a result of successful Soviet operations yesterday, another 16 enemy fortifications were captured, including eight artillery batteries. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy troops and enemy military targets with great success, and also conducted reconnaissance flights. (TASS, 15th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Film Industry's 20th Anniversary</h3>
<p>Moscow - On the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Soviet film industry, the Pravda newspaper commented, "The Soviet film industry has now become an important part of the Soviet socialist industry. There are currently 100,000 people engaged in film work. The Soviet film industry was founded after the success of the revolution, and now Soviet filmmaking no longer needs to seek assistance from abroad. The Soviet people's interest in movies has been increasing day by day. In 1928, movie theaters sold a total of 310,000,000 tickets, which increased to 1.2 billion in 1939. In the Tsarist era, there were only 2,000 movie theaters, which has now increased to 31,000. Soviet films are popular in Europe and the United States, and are also shown in 30 countries. The hallmark of Soviet films is the trinity of truth, goodness, and beauty." (TASS, 14th)</p>
<h3>3,000 Britons Volunteer for Finnish Army; Government Has Issued General Licenses and Allowed Finland to Establish Recruitment Agency</h3>
<p>London - It was announced in the House of Commons last night that the government has issued general licenses to Britons who volunteer for the Finnish army and has allowed Finland to establish a recruitment agency in London. Soviet Ambassador Maisky anticipated this announcement and sat in the diplomatic gallery of the House of Commons to listen. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>London - According to Finnish sources last night, 2,000 Britons have enlisted as volunteers to go to Finland. These volunteers are those who have registered at the Finnish embassy in London. (United Press, 15th)</p>
<p>London - During this afternoon's session of the House of Commons, Labor MP Mr. Plett asked about the issue of aid to Finland. Undersecretary of State for the Home Department Mr. Pike immediately replied in writing, stating, "Regarding the issue of our country's volunteers joining the Finnish army, the government has carefully considered it in reference to the resolution on aid to Finland passed by the League of Nations Assembly on December 14th of last year. It was immediately determined that the existing laws prohibiting people from joining foreign armies have existing exemptions. Moreover, if our citizens who voluntarily go to Finland to enlist were subject to these laws, it would contradict the League of Nations Assembly resolution both in letter and in spirit. For this reason, the government has already permitted its citizens to join the Finnish army and has allowed that country to establish a recruitment office in London." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>London - The British government's permission for people to volunteer for the Finnish army has been well-received by the local press, who say that it is in line with the League of Nations Assembly resolution. Some have said that this matter may hinder British foreign policy, thereby inviting disputes, which is absurd. The Hague International Public Law has stated, "Neutral countries bear no responsibility for those who cross their borders to enlist in the army of one of the belligerent parties." Therefore, the Soviet Union has no reason to protest, especially since the Soviet Union also had volunteers participating in the Spanish Civil War. The Times published an editorial stating, "A small nation is fighting to defend its freedom, and it is necessary to organize an army to provide assistance, but it cannot be considered perfect without the participation of Britons. At this moment, a volunteer recruitment center has been established in London, and all British people, regardless of class or party, are enthusiastically supporting it." (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>London - People here are very concerned about the news of the recent fighting on the Finnish front. Although the Red Army, relying on its military strength, is constantly attacking the Mannerheim Line and suffering heavy casualties, there is concern about how long this "Finnish Verdun" can hold out. At this point, Finland urgently needs foreign aid. In addition to the 400 aircraft that Britain and France have already shipped to Finland, Britain has also allowed volunteers to go to enlist. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam - According to news from London, because there is no doubt about the Western countries' determination to aid Finland, the British newspapers are writing articles discussing the scope of the aid. A Reuter dispatch from New York stated that New York sources are spreading rumors that if the Soviet Union makes successful advances or Germany interferes in the Scandinavian countries, the Allied forces will send one division each from the French army, the Polish army, and the Canadian army to aid Finland. According to the Standard Evening News, British Chief of the General Staff General Ironside said that Finland currently needs 150,000 volunteers and 200 aircraft to resist the Soviet army. It is believed that the New York rumors may have originated from this. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<h3>Heavy Snow on the Western Front; Fighting West of the Saar River</h3>
<p>Paris - Heavy snow has fallen on the Western Front, and all military activity has been reduced to a minimum. However, the cold has now subsided slightly. Air activity has completely stopped due to poor visibility. According to an army communiqué, there were two incidents of fighting west of the Saar River today. In one incident, German troops attempted to attack a French outpost in Lin隅, but after opening fire, they retreated. In the other incident, a German patrol was scattered by French artillery fire after approaching a French outpost too closely after sunset, leaving behind several corpses. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<h3>Rumor: German-Soviet Defensive Alliance Treaty Established, Applicable to Northern Europe and the Near East</h3>
<p>London - It is widely rumored here that Germany and the Soviet Union have established a defensive alliance treaty applicable to Northern Europe and the Near East. The two countries have also agreed to cooperate on Turkey, and German troops will be sent to the Caucasus region of the Soviet Union (bordering Turkey and Persia). Officials here are unaware of this. Informed sources say that the Soviet Union once concentrated troops near the Turkish border in the territories of the Georgian, Azerbaijani, and Armenian republics last year, especially in Baku (on the Caspian Sea coast) and Batumi (on the Black Sea coast), as well as along the oil pipeline connecting the Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. Later, after Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu visited Moscow, the Soviet authorities withdrew a portion of the troops on the pretext of expressing sincerity to Turkey. In reality, the withdrawal was necessary because the people of the Georgian Republic often opposed the Red Army's presence in their territory, which often led to disturbances. Even now, it is possible that the Soviet Union, citing the presence of large American and French forces in the Near East as a pretext, is concentrating troops on the Turkish border again. However, the rumor that 500,000 German troops will also be sent to the Transcaucasus is not credible, both because such a force would pose a significant threat to the Soviet Union and because it would be difficult to accomplish in practice due to transportation problems. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Moscow - The local Izvestia newspaper commented on the situation in the Near East, believing that the Allied powers were attempting to organize an anti-German bloc in the Near East in order to weaken Germany's economic power and use the Near East as a base to threaten the Soviet Union. However, the people of the Near East are no longer willing to be exploited by Britain. The Arabs continue to resist British rule, and the Turkish people also oppose those who encourage war. The people of Turkey and Afghanistan have not forgotten that they were able to break free from British imperialism with the help of the Soviet Union. (Haitong, 15th)</p>

<h3>Shou Jingwei Arrives in Hong Kong from Chongqing</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - Shou Jingwei arrived in Hong Kong from Chongqing to handle the foreign trade of tea for the China Tea Company. According to him, the China Tea Company has been designated as a specialized tea company and transformed into a purely state-owned agency under the Ministry of Trade, with its capital increased to 10 million yuan. The original shares held by the provinces will be returned. However, experimental tea factories will be established in various provinces in the future, and the ten provinces will still be allowed to invest and cooperate. Shou has been in contact with various countries in recent days to promote sales, which have been quite successful. He will return to Chongqing in a week. (Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Wu Zhongxin Distributes Alms in Tibet</h3>
<p>Lhasa - Tibetan society is centered on Buddhism, and the three major monasteries of Drepung, Sera, and Ganden each have thousands of lamas, wielding great authority in Buddhism. After Chairman Wu Zhongxin arrived in Tibet, he personally visited and gave alms to the three major monasteries, leaving a very good impression. According to Tibetan custom, every Lunar New Year, all the lamas from the various monasteries gather at the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa to chant scriptures, worship Buddha, and receive alms from the government and philanthropists. Chairman Wu arrived during this period and expanded the distribution of alms at the Jokhang Temple today. Lamas chanted scriptures to pray for victory in the war against Japan, and an estimated 30,000 monks participated, all of whom were delighted and inspired by the Central Government's kindness. Chairman Wu plans to send representatives to Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse, rear Tibet, to distribute alms after the enthronement ceremony of the Dalai Lama. (Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Prepares to Celebrate Dalai Lama Enthronement Ceremony</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The enthronement ceremony of the 14th Dalai Lama is scheduled to be held in Lhasa on the 22nd of this month. All sectors of Chongqing will hold a celebration meeting on that day.

<h3>Lingdong Chinese Laborers Attack Nan'ao by Raft Across the Sea; Japanese Navy Considers Nan'ao an Important Stronghold; Chinese Laborers Sneak In and Burn Japanese Military Warehouse; Dozens of Japanese Soldiers Killed in the Warehouse Battle</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: Nan'ao County is an isolated island overseas, located at the junction of Fujian and Guangdong provinces. At the beginning of the "July 7th" Resistance War, Nan'ao was once occupied. Because the island is the throat of Lingdong and the key to Fujian and Guangdong, the Japanese Navy regards it as one of the important strongholds in its southward policy. The island produces fish and salt, and together with Dongshan Island in Zhao'an County, Fujian Province, it forms a strategic alignment. It is only separated by a narrow strip of water from Zhaolin, Haishan, and Huanggang in Raoping, with a sea journey of about thirteen miles. If the sea is calm and the wind is favorable, it can be crossed within three hours. The year before last, Nan'ao fell, and the military, political, and party organs moved to Haishan Island. County Magistrate Hong Zhizheng set up an office in the Yu Family Ancestral Hall in Huanggang City. Party Affairs Commissioner Zhang Qianlong secretly stayed at Yun'gai Temple to work, guiding the village chiefs to organize the people. Hong Zhizheng once led more than 300 maritime braves to cross the sea and raid Long'ao, Shen'ao, Qianjiang, and Houzhai, capturing nine puppet organization leaders alive and recovering the entire island. Last year, the island was occupied by the Japanese army again, which accelerated the construction of coastal roads, using Long'ao and Qianjiang as military strongholds, and completely blockaded Nan'ao, forbidding fishing boats and bamboo rafts from going out to prevent leakage of military secrets. Only one electric boat was left to trade with Shantou, collecting import and export taxes, and using military tickets. Industry and commerce were all under control, and everything was expensive, with opium and gambling rampant, and the people living in misery. The laborers arrested by the Japanese army in Chaozhou and Shantou were first imprisoned in Nan'ao, trained, and then sent to Taiwan, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and other places. New soldiers and military supplies shipped from Taiwan to Chaozhou and Shantou also first arrived at Nan'ao to land, and then used small electric boats to transport them to Shantou, Chenghai, and other places to replenish supplies. Since the island was blockaded, it has been isolated from the mainland of Raoping and Chenghai, and no news can get through. Fishermen who escaped from Nan'ao gathered in Zhaolin, Jingzhou, Hongmen, Haishan, Xunhui, Nanbeigang, Caogou, Dongli, and other places, still making a living by the sea. Fishermen's families moved to Fushan, Lotus Mountain, Wanghailing, and other places to reclaim wasteland, living in extreme poverty. Although the government tried to provide relief from time to time, it was a drop in the bucket and ultimately did no good. They missed their hometowns and gazed at the blue Yun'gai Mountain, longing for it. Therefore, they eagerly sought to recover their homeland and rebuild their homes, so they joined Hong Zhizheng's command one after another, volunteering to go out to sea to fish at night. If they met Nan'ao fishing boats, they would be filled with mixed emotions of sorrow and joy, privately inquiring about the recent situation of their hometown, whether the houses had been destroyed, and whether there was any way to pass through the coastal inspection posts. As a result, they knew the internal situation of the island, as well as the strength of the Japanese army, the island's defensive works, and the ways to enter and exit. Since Nan'ao had become the general maritime supply station for the Japanese army in Chaozhou and Shantou, the Japanese and puppet army hospital for the wounded and sick, and the electric oil and bombs needed by the Japanese air force were all stored on the island, the movements of the Japanese army in Lingdong were closely related to Nan'ao. Last November, Huang Dawei, with the help of the Japanese Navy, sneaked into Zhao'an in Fujian. Beforehand, the puppet army had gathered in Nan'ao to distribute guns, and then transported them into Chenghai City to invade Zhanglin, Donglong, and Huanggang. On the 25th of that month, 700 to 800 Japanese Marine Corps soldiers also gathered in Qianjiang and Houzhai, and took advantage of shallow-water gunboats to occupy Haishan, Zhaolin, Huanggang, and Jingzhou, in response to Huang Dawei's troops, and sneaked along the coastline into Zhao'an territory. On December 8, the puppet Peace Army was miserably defeated on the border of Fujian and Guangdong, Lin Zhizhou was captured alive, and Zhaolin, Huanggang, Zhanglin, and Lianyang were successively recovered by the Chinese army. The Japanese Marine Corps crossed Haishan Island and Hongmen Island by boat, occupying them for more than a month without retreating. The two islands are very close to Huangdao and Xiaodong, which can protect Nan'ao. Because the Chinese side had no naval forces, it could not attack Haishan. The eastern border of Haishan is the production area of ​​Baiying Mountain, and the island is surrounded by shallow beaches and salt fields, which can be easily crossed by boats. When the tide recedes, fishermen from Huanggang can travel freely to and from Sishui without any obstacles, so the Chinese side can easily control the Japanese situation.</p>
<p>On January 20 this year, when the Japanese army in Chao'an attempted to invade Fengshun and Jieyang, the new Japanese soldiers on Nan'ao Island (transported from Taiwan, Dalian, Xiamen, and other places) were all transported to Chaozhou and Shantou. Only about 300 Japanese Marines and Northeastern puppet troops remained, stationed in several key ports such as Long'ao, Yun'ao, Shen'ao, Qing'ao, Qianjiang, and Houjiang, with only 20 or 30 people in each place. The number of warships was reduced from six or seven to two. The Japanese troops in Haishan and Hongmen also took speedboats to Waisha, Nanbeigang, to rescue Chenghai City, losing their lateral monitoring effect. The Japanese electric boats and speedboats near Haishan Island disappeared from then on. Upon receiving the report, the Chinese team stationed in Zhaolin, Raoping, immediately summoned the village chiefs and armed laborers to discuss taking advantage of the opportunity to cross the sea and attack Nan'ao, and recover Haishan and Hongmen. At that time, because of the severe drought, the salt fields had a bumper harvest, and the snow-white sea salt had already piled up into mountains, with sharp corners exposed on the coastline, like Egyptian pyramids. If Haishan Island is recaptured, this salt can be transported to the interior of Raoping for sale, and the threat to the Fujian-Guangdong border can be reduced. At that time (20th), the villages in Zhaolin, Dagang, Shencun, Huanggang, Xialiao, and other places, after consultation, were convened by the magistrate of Nan'ao County to recruit fishermen who had lost their homes in Nan'ao to participate. At this time, everyone was overjoyed to hear the news. Subsequently, one or two hundred maritime heroes who were good at swimming were selected, equipped with fishing rafts, and put guns, grenades, and other items on the rafts, and crossed the sea in four or five teams. After dusk on the 21st, everyone gathered at the Xiaoxue School in the Dagang District for dinner, and led by the Nan'ao fishermen, crossed Haishan Island, first occupying the Japanese signal tower, not allowing it to launch rockets to send signals. At 11 o'clock at night, taking advantage of the Japanese-left speedboats and fishing boats, more than a dozen of them towed the bamboo rafts and sailed towards Houzhai, Nan'ao. At that time, the moonlight was hazy, and white mist filled the sea. The boats dispersed and sailed into Houzhai, without the sound of oars or lights or dog barking on the shore. The laborers calmly landed with guns, leaving very few fishermen to guard the boats, and then groped forward in teams towards Long'ao (where the county government was located), Qianjiang (where the Japanese military warehouse wharf was located). The laborers all wore leather shoes, and their steps were unfamiliar. The Japanese soldiers watching on the mountain did not find the signal from Haishan Island, nor the movement on the sea, and were completely unprepared. When the Chinese army rushed into the camp, the Japanese and puppet troops began to fight in panic. Because it was late at night, they did not know the truth, and dozens of them were killed by the laborers with grenades and broadswords. The Japanese army scrambled up the mountain, using wire and steel to cover themselves, and fired artillery indiscriminately. The Chinese army threw bombs and set fire to the Qianjiang warehouse. For a time, the flames soared into the sky. The Chinese army seized dozens of long guns and more than a dozen boxes of bullets. Later, Japanese warships sailed to Long'ao for rescue. The Chinese army quietly retreated to a remote place, put the captured documents and so on on the bamboo rafts, and retreated back to Zhaolin across the sea. At this time, the east was already white. In this battle, the Chinese army only died one person and injured six or seven people. The corpses were also dragged back, and none were lost. The Japanese army on the Fujian-Guangdong border could not instigate another invasion of Fujian. The Japanese army in Fujian intended to lift the coastal blockade and send Japanese people to forcibly collect taxes on the sea.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army on the Fujian-Guangdong Border Cannot Instigate Another Invasion of Fujian; The Japanese Army in Fujian Intends to Lift the Coastal Blockade and Send Japanese People to Forcibly Collect Taxes on the Sea</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: The Japanese invasion of Dongshan and Zhao'an counties in southern Fujian has failed. The occupation of Pingtan and Meizhou in eastern Fujian has also been retaken by the Chinese army. A month ago, the Japanese army in Chaozhou and Shantou transferred reinforcements from Guangzhou and Shanghai, planning to invade the Fujian border again, but there has been no movement so far. According to reports, it is because of problems within the Japanese and puppet forces that military operations to invade Fujian cannot be instigated. Now the Japanese side deeply feels that it is at the end of its rope and has come up with another way politically. It has set up a puppet Guangdong Eastern Administrative Office in Shantou to control the puppet organs in Chaozhou and Shantou, and use it to form a confrontation with the Japanese army in Guangzhou. Because the Japanese army in Chaozhou is from the naval faction and the Japanese army in Guangzhou is from the land faction, they have always been jealous of each other and are uneasy. The puppet troops in various places echo each other and obey their respective factions, which is why the internal rifts are very deep and cannot be reconciled. Moreover, the US-Japan commercial treaty has been declared abolished, and Japan's ruling and opposition parties are extremely anxious. They feel that the military expenses for the invasion of China are huge, and the domestic economy has long been riddled with holes. Now that they have suffered this major blow, they are even more panicked. The Japanese army in Fujian, unable to cope with the situation, has come up with a strange idea, plotting to open up the previously blockaded coast of Fujian and send Japanese personnel in sections to be responsible for collecting taxes, in order to subsidize the shortage of military expenses. It is planned that Gao Qi Hongji will be responsible for the waters of Pingtan, Jingtian, and Xianyou, Kuanfeng Sanlang will be responsible for the waters of Zhangpu, and the local navy will be responsible for the waters of Fuzhou and Wenzhou. However, the Chinese military and political authorities have seen through their plot and have telegraphed the military and political organs in various places to pay close attention. The Xiamen Office of the Guangzhou Maritime Administration Bureau has issued five articles of the Measures for Restricting Navigation in Coastal Ports in accordance with the order of the Military Affairs Commission: (1) During the military period, coastal and river ports may be prohibited from navigation if it is deemed necessary to block them. (2) All Chinese and foreign ships, when sailing in war zones or martial law zones, shall apply to the competent maritime administration office for a pass certificate. (3) Navigation or berthing is not allowed in the route and berthing location not specified in the pass certificate. (4) If the military authorities believe that a certain place or port should be restricted from navigation during a certain special period, they must notify the competent maritime administration office to investigate and stop approving the route there. (5) For those who intrude into prohibited ports or navigate without a pass certificate, the method of punishment shall be divided into three types according to the seriousness of the circumstances: 1. 2. Allow them to load and unload passengers and goods, and the original ship shall return, prohibiting them from interacting with the shore. 3. Confiscate all or part of the goods carried. The foregoing handling shall be executed by the local military chief, the local government, and the maritime administration office to prevent the conspiracy of Japanese economic aggression.</p>

The registration of specialized and technical personnel is based on the principle of registering in person. Those who are not in Chongqing may register by correspondence. The registration procedure is simplified as much as possible. Anyone with a skill can apply for registration. In the past year (from December 1938 to the end of November 1939), a total of 1128 people have been qualified after review, including science, engineering, agriculture, commerce, medicine, law, education, liberal arts, military, and special occupations. Among them, 59 graduated from foreign universities, 7 studied abroad, 9 graduated from foreign specialized schools, 437 graduated from domestic universities, 38 studied, 106 graduated from specialized schools, 5 studied, 374 graduated from senior vocational schools, 2 studied, 5 graduated from junior vocational schools, 10 graduated from middle schools, 4 studied, 1 graduated from primary schools, 62 graduated from special training classes, and 91 others, totaling 1126 people.

Others such as Xi'an, Kunming, Hanzhong, and the provinces of Gan, Min, Yue, Yu, and Jin, and Xikang have fewer than 10 people each. There are also correspondence registrants in the occupied areas such as Shanghai and Su and Wan, and abroad such as Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, and Annam, especially Shanghai with 52 people and Macau with 23 people. The amount of remuneration that the registrants fill in can reveal the nature of their desire to work and the level of their qualifications. According to the statistics, the desired remuneration ranges from 30 yuan to 360 yuan, among which the most people hope to earn 60 yuan per month (128 people), followed by those who hope to earn 100 yuan (107 people), followed by those who hope to earn 40 or 50 yuan, and 385 people who stated that they do not care about the amount of remuneration.</p>

The presidents of people's education centers in Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Hubei, and Kang provinces drawn in the first phase have already started school on December 25, 1939, and officially started classes on the 28th. The main purpose of establishing the class is to enable the trainees to: 1. Truly become believers in the Three Principles of the People and warriors who thoroughly follow orders; 2. Truly obtain the knowledge to preside over general institutions and the essentials of leading affairs; and 3. Have a true understanding of social education theory, a proper method for promoting undertakings, and a great improvement in work technology, so that when they return to the center in the future, they can use what they have learned to transform the people's education center into a center for promoting society, in order to complete the great mission of the War of Resistance and national construction.

The referees Dai Changling and Lu Changfu, who were sent by the referee association, were both absent for no reason. They were temporarily replaced by Wu Zibin and Zheng Zhifang. The game was delayed until 8:15 pm. The discipline of the referees also seems to need to be maintained. The unreasonable spectators booed and cheered, which was disappointing. Shanghai Youth's performance was subpar last night, while the Bombers were more invigorated. As a result, the Bombers defeated Shanghai Youth by twenty-seven to twenty. Now both sides have won once, forming a tie. A final duel will be held at 8 pm tomorrow to determine the champion. In last night's contact, Zhang Xianlun of the Bombers made one of two free throws, and Dong Yangfeng added a goal, leading remotely with six to zero. Shanghai Youth was unwilling to show weakness, and Chen Hongqi, Li Zude, and Sun Damiao regained five points, with the difference only a small amount. After Guangyi and Zude reciprocated, Kong, Qu, Zhang, and Xu of the Bombers suddenly increased by ten points. In the first half, Shanghai Youth was at a disadvantage with seven to eighteen. When the change of battle sounded, Damiao scored first, and Jusheng immediately returned the color. At this point, both sides committed a lot of fouls. At twenty-five to fourteen, Zhang Xianlun and Dong Yangfeng of the Bombers and Chen Hongqi of Shanghai Youth were all disqualified for four fouls in succession. Although Shanghai Youth launched a fierce counterattack, it ultimately suffered a disastrous defeat with twenty to twenty-seven due to the excessive score in the first half.</p>

<h3>West Qing Handball Singles Final Tonight: He Suoqing to Face Que Keling; He Eliminated Hua Fenggang the Night Before</h3>
<p>The West Qing handball singles final, a clash between Chinese and Western champions, will see He Suoqing face off against F. Que Keling at 6 PM today in the association's handball room. He is a master player among the Chinese, while Que is a leading figure among the Westerners. Their skills are considered evenly matched on the court. The two players previously met in the quarter-final week, where He easily won the first set but lost the following two, unfortunately losing by a score of 1-2. The night before last, he directly defeated Hua Fenggang in two sets, securing the right to the final. He is returning with a determined mindset for revenge, aiming to avenge his previous defeat. However, Que's momentum is strong and should not be underestimated. The competition uses a double-elimination system; since He has already lost once, if he wins this match, he will still need to have a final showdown with Que. Otherwise, he will be runner-up, and the championship will belong to Que. At this critical juncture, He must exert all his strength to defeat his strong opponent, allowing handball king Zhu Kuan's championship, held for several years, to return to Chinese hands.</p>
<p>The He-Hua Match</p>
<p>The quarter-final between He Suoqing and Hua Fenggang was held the night before last. After the start, He demonstrated his prowess, taking the first three points. Hua worked hard to win back one point, but He quickly took the lead at 6-1, and then established a commanding lead of 17-3. Hua was unable to recover, losing the first set 10-21. In the second set, his momentum increased, gaining three consecutive points, leaving He helpless. After He recovered one point, Hua added two more, making it 5-1. After several rounds, Hua again led by 7-3. At this point, He unleashed his power, scoring 14 consecutive points in one go, quickly reaching 20-7, reversing the score by 13 points. In the end, he won again 21-9, securing his place in the final.</p>

<h3>Coal and Rice Prices Soar Uncontrollably, Threatening Citizens' Livelihoods; Concession Authorities Should Plan Relief Measures, and Effective Crackdowns Should Be Implemented on Hoarding and Manipulation</h3>
<p>Recently, the market prices of daily necessities for citizens in this city have been soaring. The prices of rice and coal, in particular, have been rising continuously. Due to price controls, domestic rice is rarely seen in the market, while Saigon rice has exceeded 50 yuan due to the rising exchange rate yesterday. The price of coal is also rising daily. Citizens are spreading the news to each other, feeling deeply uneasy about their livelihoods. The general public hopes that the concession authorities can quickly curb those who manipulate and hoard, so that citizens' lives can return to stability as soon as possible. Coal companies are also notifying customers with stored coal to ship it out quickly. Among them, six coal companies have stored a total of 20,000 tons of customer orders. In addition, there are also private hoarders, proving that the current surge in coal prices in the market is not solely due to a shortage of goods. Similarly, the reserves of rice are not insufficient. It is expected that if effective measures to reduce prices can be implemented in the short term, the market situation may improve slightly. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Prices Continue to Soar</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Tea Association market opened after the overall conclusion of the 28th year, speculators manipulated and hoarded, causing rice prices to soar shockingly, breaking the new record of previous years. In market transactions, domestic rice is absent due to the price limits set by the concession authorities, and off-market transactions are rampant. Top-grade white rice even exceeds the price limit by more than ten yuan per shih. Foreign rice has no price limit. As a result, No. 1 Saigon broke the 50 yuan mark. If this continues, it will have a very significant impact on people's livelihoods.</p>
<p>Bean and Rice Association Gathers to Discuss Everything</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association issued Announcement No. 121 on February 13, prohibiting irregular transactions, and Announcement No. 113, stating responsibilities. Rice prices continue to soar, affecting people's livelihoods. The deduction of donations for foreign rice has not yet been implemented, so a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees has been scheduled for 4:00 PM today at No. 15 Edward Road. In addition to discussing how to stabilize rice prices, it will also seek ways to encourage the implementation of foreign rice donation deductions. It is also heard that the association has sent representatives to visit Deputy General Manager He of the Public Works Department to discuss the soaring rice prices, and to discuss how to stabilize rice prices in the future.</p>
<p>The Ping Tiao Committee to Conduct a Second Phase of Subsidized Sales</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ping Tiao Committee has been conducting subsidized sales to relieve the people of Shanghai. The first phase ended on February 6, and a standing committee meeting has been scheduled for 3:00 PM today at the Guangdong Road Shipping Club to discuss the date and all measures for the second phase of subsidized sales. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, the subsidized sales date is tentatively set for February 23. If preparations are not completed in time, it will be extended for several days. It has also been decided to continue to entrust the rice shops that are members of the Rice Industry Association to handle the subsidized sales. The price will be raised, pending a decision at today's meeting. Regarding soliciting donations, it will be carried out actively.</p>
<p>The Second Batch of Group-Ordered Rice Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>After the Shanghai People's Food Adjustment Association launched group purchases of foreign rice, various agencies, groups, factories, and companies enthusiastically commissioned the association to order foreign rice. The association has ordered a total of six batches of foreign rice (No. 2 Saigon), totaling 25,400 bags. Apart from the first batch of 6,000 bags that have already arrived in Shanghai, the second batch of 10,000 bags has also been loaded onto foreign ships and has arrived in Shanghai. Procedures such as advance payments and deliveries have been processed. The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth batches will continue to arrive soon. It is heard that those applying to the association to entrust them to order foreign rice are more crowded than before.</p>
<h3>Extreme Chaos in the Coal Market</h3>
<p>It is estimated that there are still 500,000 tons of coal in Shanghai, but the selling price is rising abnormally, which is affecting other prices and threatening the livelihoods of civilians. A reporter from Daguan News Agency inquired about the reasons yesterday and learned the following details:</p>
<p>Rampant Increase in Water Transportation Costs Affects Coal Prices</p>
<p>Reportedly, the water transportation costs from Haiphong, India, have risen to 25 to 27 shillings, more than double the rate three months ago. The reason is that when foreign exchange was controlled, companies competed to purchase foreign exchange and ordered large quantities of goods. Also, after the European war, ships were controlled for navigation. Without approval, they were not allowed to sail, and the number of ships coming to China was reduced. All of these factors caused water transportation costs to rise, which in turn led to a sharp increase in coal prices.</p>
<p>Selling Prices Increase More Than Tenfold</p>
<p>Although water transportation prices have risen sharply, not all of the advanced payment loans have been delivered. Therefore, the new goods at 25 shillings have not yet been shipped to Shanghai. The goods currently sold are still inventory at 100 yuan or less. Today's market price: Kai Ping block is 300 yuan (70 yuan three months ago, 12 yuan before the war), coal dust is 170 yuan (40 yuan three months ago, 9 yuan before the war), white coal is 170 yuan (80 yuan three months ago, 22 yuan before the war), Indian bituminous coal is 150 yuan (100 yuan three months ago, no goods arrived in Shanghai before the war). As a result, speculation is rampant. A few people are deliberately raising prices, creating a situation where prices rise every day and night. There is even the strange tale of the same goods having two different prices.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Coal Reserves Are Not Lacking</p>
<p>If we say that inventory is lacking, then there are a total of six warehouses in Pudong, each with at least 70,000 tons. The warehouses on Saposey Road and Macon Road in Puxi also have more than 60,000 tons. The raw materials for coal balls also total 60,000 tons, bringing the total to 510,000 tons. Even if we continue to calculate at 3,000 tons sold per day, there are still 200 days of supply. Moreover, the current daily sales are only 1,000 tons. In addition, there are hundreds of thousands of tons being transported from Haiphong to Shanghai. More than a dozen barge ships arrive every week, unloading at Tianhou Palace Bridge (each ship carries 1,000 tons). Therefore, the claim that inventory is lacking is not a fact.</p>
<p>Boiled Water Industry is Being Helped with Subsidized Coal Sales</p>
<p>As for the boiled water industry, it was unable to maintain operations due to soaring coal prices, so 250 businesses declared they were suspending operations and jointly requested assistance from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Coal Industry Association. According to sources, the three coal companies have voluntarily gathered 600 tons of coal dust and are selling it at a low price of 98 yuan (currently selling for 170 yuan) to tiger stoves, one ton per business. Therefore, most of the businesses that had suspended operations have resumed operations. However, this small amount is only enough to supply a few days' use, so the future of the industry remains extremely bleak.</p>
<p>Coal Ball Prices Rose Sharply Again Yesterday</p>
<p>There are no No. 1 coal dust raw materials for the coal ball industry. Only No. 2 coal dust is available on the market. The cost has been announced as follows: wholesale was 116 yuan on the 12th, 120 yuan on the 13th, 126 yuan on the 14th, and 132 yuan yesterday. Retail prices have risen from 5.2 yuan, 5.8 yuan, 6.2 yuan to 6.8 yuan per dan. The soaring prices are beyond description. The breakdown is as follows: (1) Raw material costs: Yitai and No. 2 coal dust are 100 yuan per metric ton in national currency, Dalongxing No. 2 coal dust is 110 yuan per metric ton in national currency, and Tongcheng Company No. 2 coal dust is 105 yuan per metric ton in national currency. These were the market prices on the fifth day of the lunar new year (the first day of market opening), and fluctuate from morning to night. No. 1 coal dust is unavailable. (2) Manufacturing costs: 11 yuan per metric ton for drying coal, 1.4 yuan for electricity, 1.1 yuan for labor, 2.2 yuan for machine repair, 0.5 yuan for waste loss, 1.7 yuan for administrative expenses, 1.8 yuan for water and cartage, and 1.4 yuan for yellow mud, totaling 20.01 yuan for manufacturing costs per ton. Based on a 97% conversion rate for coal dust raw materials, the current maximum market price is as high as 116 yuan per ton, or 6.1 yuan per zu (100 market catties).</p>
<h3>Question of Management Rights Over the Opening of Hongkou: The Japanese Side Has Not Relinquished Control; Paying Special Attention to Defense; Citizens Visiting Their Residences Feel Doubly Sad</h3>
<p>The China Press reported that at yesterday's (14th) reception for journalists by the Japanese side, a reporter asked whether the Japanese naval landing force's announcement that Chinese people entering the Japanese military defense zone in the Public Concession from midnight yesterday would no longer need to show a pass and that the curfew would be lifted was a precursor to returning full management of the area north of Suzhou Creek to the Municipal Council. A spokesman for the Japanese Navy replied that the Japanese Navy believed that police matters should be handled by the police as much as possible, but defense issues were an entirely separate matter. Reporters continued to press on this point, but the spokesman only replied, "The transition period will be relatively long," and then stated that the easing of pass checks did not apply to trucks carrying scrap iron, metal, tiles, bricks, and weapons. In response to another question, the spokesman said that the opening of obstacles between Hongkou and West Hongkou, as well as parts of other areas, had not yet been considered.</p>
<p>Opened Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>After occupying areas such as Hongkou and Zhabei, the Japanese side issued various "passes" and "citizen's certificates" to restrict access, allowing only pass holders to pass through. Measures restricting the movement of third-country nationals have also been enforced to this day. Recently, in an attempt to revive the market in the occupied areas, the Japanese side officially implemented the announced cancellation of the "pass" system starting yesterday morning. All Chinese and foreign pedestrians can now freely enter and exit. However, the Japanese soldiers at the original guard posts have not been seen retreating. All packages, boxes, etc., must still be strictly inspected before being allowed to pass. According to news from relevant sources, in the near future, all tram services that operated in the Hongkou area before the war will also be restored.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Bridges</p>
<p>Along the Hongkou District's Waibaidu Bridge, Zhapu Road Bridge, Sichuan Road Bridge, and the Wengjianshi Road and Haining Road gaps on North Jiangxi Road, Wuzhen Road Bridge, Xinzha Bridge, and the Mint Bridge, there are still two to three or three to four Japanese naval special landing forces stationed in the watchtowers. Each bridge and gap has road signs indicating the direction of entry and exit. If anyone mistakenly enters, they are beaten with rifle butts. There are many people entering, and many leaving, but they are all visiting their residences, feeling doubly sad, and then leaving.</p>
<p>Guarded Areas</p>
<p>A Daguan News Agency reporter visited the Hongkou area yesterday and saw Japanese sentries still standing guard as usual at the Qiujiang Road intersection, Outer Hongqiao, Middle Hongqiao, and Baoshan Road intersection. At the end of North Sichuan Road and the North Station, the Central Mint, and in front of the Japanese military camp in the Civilian Village on Zhongshan Road, security guards are still stationed, prohibiting passage. Dilapidated walls and ruins are everywhere, desolate and unusual. The bustling streets are filled with poor workers. In the Japanese military defense zone in the A area of North Jiangxi Road, the majority are also lower-class civilians.</p>
<p>British Troops Stationed</p>
<p>The British England Army stationed at the Qianye Guild Hall on North Henan Road, north of Suzhou Creek, and the British troops guarding the Jie Lu Han Bridge, Kaifeng Road, and New Garbage Bridge remain stationed as before, unmoved. Judging from their situation, they seem to be strengthening their defenses, maintaining tranquility and security in the defense zone. They continue to pay close attention to entrances into Zhabei and Hongkou, and are determined to continue supplementing insufficient police force.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army: Use of Donations; Funds Raised in Shanghai Will Never Be Used Elsewhere</h3>
<p>Salvation Army Brigadier Morey announced that the army expects to raise 80,000 yuan in donations by the end of this week. Yesterday, a group of twenty Chinese people collectively donated five hundred yuan, and Salvation Army Lieutenant-General Simon also made a generous donation, bringing the total amount raised to over 79,000 yuan. The army officers are extremely excited. Morey also said that every penny raised in Shanghai will be used in Shanghai, Beiping, Nanjing, and other places. The army will conduct separate fundraising and will never divert funds from Shanghai. If people from all walks of life have donations, they can send them to the army headquarters at No. 40 Sassoon House.</p>
<h3>Domestic Remittances: Remittance Locations; Remittances to Various Ports Must Be Applied for and Approved</h3>
<p>The Joint Office of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China has printed a list of the locations where the four banks can remit funds, as many people are unclear about the remittance locations of the four banks, often causing difficulties. However, remittances from the mainland to various ports must first be applied to the domestic remittance review office of the four banks, and remittances will only be approved after a confidential investigation. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency has recorded the list of remittance locations of the four banks as follows: (Guangxi Province) Guilin, Wuzhou, Yishan, Xuzhou, Nanning, Jingxi, Baiyi, Pingxiang, Liuzhou, Tiandong, Guixian; (Yunnan Province) Kunming, Mengzi, Xiaguan, Xiangyun, Chuxiong, Baoshan, Tengchong, Mangshi, Zhengjiang, Qujing; (Guizhou Province) Guiyang, Panxian, Duyun, Qianxi, Dushan, Anshun, Zunyi, Zhenyuan, Bijie, Huangping, Tongren; (Sichuan Province) Chongqing, New Urban Area, Chengdu, Wanxian, Santai, Neijiang, Jiangjin, Guangyuan, Mianyang, Nanbu, Luxian, Beibei, Zigong, South Hot Spring, Leshan, Guanxian, Taihezhen, Fengjie, Shiqiao, Hechuan, Hejiang, Peiling, Ziyang, Rongchang, Jianyang, Wutongqiao, Longchang, Zizhong, Yihan, Yibin, Nanchong, Yongchuan, Dadu; (Hunan Province) Hengyang, Changde, Yuanling, Lingling, Qiuyang, Xiushan, Zhijiang, Xinhua, Xiangtan; (Hubei Province) Yichang, Laohekou, ×Hankou; (Jiangxi Province) Fuzhou, Ji'an, Ganzhou, Shangrao, Jingdezhen, Longnan, Pingxiang, Nancheng, Ningdu; (Zhejiang Province) Yongkang, Hengzhou, ×Ningbo, Shaoxing, Haimen, Qujiang, Shengxian, ×Wenzhou, Lanxi, Zhenhai, Jinhua, Xikou, Jiangshan, Dongyang; (Shaanxi Province) Xi'an, Nanzheng, Baoji, Ningqiang, Xianyang, Jingyang, Weinan, Hanzhong, Ankang; (Henan Province) Zhenping, Luoyang; (Gansu Province) Lanzhou, Tianyong, Minxian, Pingliang; (Fujian Province) ×Fuzhou, Yanping, Jian'ou, Sandu, Pucheng, ×Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, Yongchun, Yong'an, Longyan, Hanjiang, ×Gulangyu; (Ningxia Province) Ningxia; (Qinghai Province) Xining; (Xikang Province) Ya'an; (Anhui Province) Tunxi, Shexian; (Guangdong Province) Shaoguan, ×Guangzhou Bay; (Shanghai City) ×Shanghai, ×Hong Kong. Those marked with × above are ports.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Becomes an Important Port for Revenue; Zhejiang Customs Revenue Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Customs revenue has seen a sharp increase. Statistics show that in 1939, the total import tax, export tax, and transit tax collected amounted to 3,720,242.8 yuan in national currency, an increase of nearly one million yuan compared to 1938. The second half of the year saw the strongest tax revenue. Because the Yongjiang River was once closed last summer, after the resumption of navigation, Guangzhou and Beihai fell one after another, and Fuzhou and Wenzhou were blockaded. The import and export goods in Zhejiang Customs were crowded, and tax revenue increased accordingly.</p>
<h3>The Agreement on Road Building Beyond the Border May Be Signed Today; The Full Text of the Agreement Will Be Disclosed After Signing; The Defense Areas of the Garrison Troops of Various Countries Will Not Change</h3>
<p>The English-language North China Daily Mail reported that, according to the Japanese authorities today (15th), Municipal Council Chairman Fessenden and "Shanghai Mayor" Fu Xiao'an will sign an agreement on the management of the road construction area beyond the border in western Shanghai at 4:00 PM on Friday. At the same time, the Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" will disclose the full text of the agreement, and the Japanese Consulate General will also issue a statement on this matter. The negotiation between the Public Concession Municipal Council and the puppet "Municipal Government" on the issue of police powers for road construction beyond the border is about to be signed. Whether the garrison troops of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy stationed in the western Shanghai area will continue their defense work has attracted the attention of the general public. According to a reporter from Daguan News Agency, whether the concession authorities and the puppet side sign a temporary agreement, the defense missions in western Shanghai of the troops stationed by the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy will not change. The troops of the various countries are in Shanghai representing orders from their respective governments and stationed in various locations. All defense sentries and patrols in all locations will continue as usual.</p>
<h3>Hongkou and Zhabei: A Scene of Desolation; Visitors to Their Former Residences Feel Limitless Sorrow</h3>
<p>Since the withdrawal of Chinese troops to the west, the northeastern district of the Public Concession (i.e., Hongkou and Yangshupu) and the areas adjacent to the concession have become territories without freedom. In order to "revive" the market in Hongkou and Zhabei, the Japanese military authorities abolished the "pass" restrictions starting yesterday and declared that Zhabei, Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Pudong would be "opened."</p>
<p>The Waibaidu Bridge, Erbaidu Bridge (Museum Road Bridge), and Sichuan Road Bridge, which lead from the concession to the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, are all equipped with wire mesh frames in the middle. The guard posts placed by the Japanese side are still occupied by Japanese naval landing forces, with a wooden sign saying "Keep to the Left." The situation is the same as before, except that the Japanese soldiers have stopped checking "passes." In addition, the two gaps at the North Jiangxi Road, Haining Road, and Wengjianshi Road intersections in the "A area" north of Suzhou Creek are still covered with dense wire mesh. The two Japanese sentry posts on both sides of the gap are also still standing. Since yesterday morning, probably because it was the first day of abolishing the "pass" and the weather was sunny, the number of people passing through the above-mentioned places to Hongkou and Yangshupu was more crowded than usual. Most of them took the opportunity to visit their former residences after the looting or long-lost relatives and friends, but it was not the "return" that the Japanese were hoping for.</p>
<p>For more than two years, Hongkou and Yangshupu have completely changed! Especially the Yangshupu area, the scene after the looting is truly desolate. In the Hongkou area under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Navy, many new "foreign firms" have been established, and advertisements for "Ajinomoto," "Liebig," etc., have been added to the walls of the streets, decorating the quiet corners with colorful colors. Only the patrols of the Municipal Council are still distributed there, performing their duties as they did before the war.</p>
<p>Before "August 13," several routes of British public buses and trolleybuses passed through the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas. Now, the public buses of the Japanese-owned "China Central Company" have replaced them, operating on different lines.</p>
<p>At these bus stops, a new notice has been posted, stating in essence that from now on, only Japanese military scrip is allowed on the China Central Metropolitan Public Bus. Otherwise, if Chinese legal tender is used, the fare must be doubled.</p>
<p>Since Zhabei was washed by artillery fire, it has become a pile of rubble. The few buildings that survived in the Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road area, apart from a few newly opened "foreign firms," are all tightly closed. The remaining few once very prosperous roads now have only broken walls and ruins, a scene of desolation and death. The Lianglu Administration Building is now just a shell full of sores. A new batch of low-rise houses has been built behind it. On the surrounding rubble wasteland, wooden signs with the words "Land for Concession Troops" are erected. The Jiaohang Warehouse on the north bank of Suzhou Creek has been occupied by nest-robbing doves, painted with the large characters "Central Market." But it is still easy to recall the heroic and moving stories of that year.</p>
<p>The situation in Pudong has not changed much, but it is much dimmer than before, and many nonsensical slogans and signs have been added along the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>After the announcement of the opening, the travel agencies that specialized in issuing passes and the vendors who made and sold pass covers, which were new special businesses that emerged after the war, as well as those who made a fortune with "passes," suffered a serious blow. This is just like many businesses on the "isolated island" at present: they are fleeting, and it is inevitable that they will tend towards decline! (Datong)</p>

<h3>Mystery of the Crackdown on Gambling Dens: Japanese Side Denies Releasing Closure News; Shanghai Municipal Council Personnel Also Feel Doubt; In Fact, Gambling Dens in Nanshi are Preparing to Open</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that a spokesman for the Japanese Army stated last night (the 14th) while entertaining news reporters that he had neither publicly disclosed the Japanese side's official view on the gambling dens in western Shanghai, nor had he stated that the Japanese Army Special Affairs Department would close down the criminal venues in the "Badlands." The English-language "China Press" had reported that he had declared at a previous reception for news reporters that the Japanese side would close down these venues, but he had not actually made such a statement, the spokesman said. The spokesman further added that after the previous reception for news reporters ended, a certain reporter asked him, "Is it true that there are rumors that the Japanese Army intends to close down gambling dens, etc.?" He then replied to the reporter informally, saying, "The Japanese side naturally attaches importance to this matter and may take some action." He did not understand how this informal reply could be taken as a formal statement at a reception.</p>
<p>Closure by the End of the Month is Already Rumored</p>
<p>The "Continental Times" reports that regarding the Japanese military police having taken formal steps to make the gambling establishments in the extra-settlement roads area cease operations, the "Continental Times" had already obtained confirmed news yesterday (the 14th). According to the news, the gambling houses have received orders to close on February 29th, without exception. However, although Shanghai Municipal Council personnel admitted to knowing about the aforementioned order, they could not say for sure whether this measure was temporary. It is now expected that the gambling houses in the extra-settlement roads area will not suddenly close down on March 1st, but will be gradually cleaned up, with those doing more business closing later.</p>
<p>Whether it Can Be Achieved is Highly Doubtful</p>
<p>However, although the Japanese authorities have already ordered the cleanup of the area, Shanghai Municipal Council personnel cannot help but feel doubtful about whether the order can be achieved. This is because large gambling houses have yet to recoup their investments, and when they invested, they believed that they would not be interfered with for at least a year. It is said that shortly after the withdrawal of the Chinese army from western Shanghai in December 1937, small gambling dens began to appear in the western district. After the opening of large gambling houses such as the Hollywood Amusement Park, the original small gambling dens mostly closed down. Rumors of a crackdown on gambling dens will also affect opium dens. Suicides or crimes by residents due to gambling debts are constantly occurring.</p>
<p>Extensive Activities in the Nanshi Area</p>
<p>It is widely rumored that the entire "Badlands" of western Shanghai will be moved to the western district. Even if the cleanup is achieved, Shanghai will still not be able to eliminate the evils of opium and gambling. It is heard that after the opening of Nanshi, many gangsters and opium and gambling operators have been extensively active, and there is large-scale flower lottery gambling. The owner of a certain large gambling house in the western district now intends to open a gambling house in a building formerly used as a restaurant at No. 725 Zhaojiabang Road, near Laoximen. In addition, some people intend to open large gambling houses at No. 1451 and No. 1603 Zhonghua Road, and at the Gonghe Theater in Laoximen.</p>
<h3>Citizens Suggest to Various Public Organizations Establishing Fair-Price Purchasing and Sales Centers, Limited to Daily Necessities Such as Rice, Flour, and Coal to Remedy People's Livelihood Difficulties and Prevent Illegitimate Profits</h3>
<p>Shanghai's commodity prices have reached a critical stage, and finding ways to suppress them is urgent. Yesterday, the United Association of Citizens of the First Special District and other public organizations received suggestions from citizens requesting the joint establishment of fair-price purchasing and sales centers to implement fair-price purchasing and sales to remedy the situation. The main points of the suggestion are: (1) The Shanghai Fair-Price Purchasing and Sales Center should be jointly organized by all legal public organizations in Shanghai. (2) The purchasing and sales funds should be advanced by various industries, and banks and money houses should provide ample loans. (3) Fair-price purchasing and sales should be limited to daily necessities such as rice, coal, flour, firewood, and charcoal. (4) The wholesale of daily necessities should be directly sold to consumers, without being re-wholesaled, and the highest prices should be set to protect the interests of consumers. (5) The sale of necessities should be priced based on the cost of purchasing and sales plus a profit, with the maximum not exceeding 5% (the profit should be used to cover administrative expenses and the lowest interest on loans). (6) The purpose of implementing fair-price purchasing and sales is to remedy the difficulties of the people's livelihood. Once the selling prices are publicly announced, they must not be adjusted according to market price fluctuations to seek illegitimate profits, and they must not compete with merchants for profits, but maintain the legitimate business of merchants.</p>
<h3>British Employee of the Power Company Died Suddenly; The Body Will be Examined; Served for Nearly Twenty Years</h3>
<p>A British employee of the Shanghai Power Company, Mr. Hayes, suddenly died at his residence at No. 278, Lane 591, Jing'an Temple Road, on the morning of the 14th. There were no signs of assassination on the body, and the sudden death was quite strange. The body has been sent to the Universal Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road. It is reported that Mr. Hayes was still working at the company as usual on Tuesday, and his actions were no different from usual. The British coroner will examine the body because Mr. Hayes' death was so sudden and strange. It is said that Mr. Hayes was 52 years old, born in 1888. He joined the Shanghai Power Company on July 1, 1919 (incidentally, Mr. Hayes' birthday). He was also a member of the British Royal Aviation Association. Mr. Hayes worked in the construction section of the Power Company and was once a member of the Shanghai Golf Club. He has a son, 12 years old. His wife and son are currently residing in his home country of Scotland.</p>
<h3>A Truck Caused an Accident; Killed a Schoolboy; Brakes Failed and Ran onto the Sidewalk; Also Knocked Down a Power Pole and a Plane Tree</h3>
<p>Su Weizhong, an 11-year-old boy from Guangdong residing at No. 6, Lane 1096, Edward Road, was a student at the nearby Boren Primary School. At 6:40 am on the morning of the incident, Su was walking to school with his leather satchel when he was passing in front of No. 1128 Edward Road on the sidewalk. At that time, a truck No. 232270 from the Youli Transportation Company at No. 352 Macgregor Road, driven by Zhu Zhaoxuan from Shaoxing, was traveling without cargo, carrying only a few empty baskets, intending to go to the Bund to load coal. However, due to speeding and malfunctioning foot brakes, the front of the truck crashed straight onto the sidewalk. In addition to overturning a rickshaw and injuring the rickshaw puller Wu Youheng, it also knocked down an iron telegraph pole and a 130-numbered tree planted by the Shanghai Municipal Council on the sidewalk. Continuing forward, it knocked down Su, crushing his skull and killing him instantly. The leather satchel Su was carrying was covered in bloodstains. Afterwards, the watchman at No. 929 reported to the Chengdu Road police station, which dispatched detectives Wang Bingheng and No. 128 Xi Sandao Tou to arrest the soldier Zhu Zhaoxuan who caused the accident. Both the truck and the driver were taken to the police station, and the rickshaw puller Wu Youheng was sent to Baojiang Hospital. Fortunately, his injuries were minor and he was soon discharged. Su's body was taken to the coroner's office. Yesterday morning, Zhu Zhaoyi was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, and the police lawyer Zhang Songyin filed charges of manslaughter, stating the facts of the case, saying that the defendant was indeed speeding and knew that the machinery was not good and the brakes were malfunctioning, so he should not have driven the car out, etc. After the judge questioned him, he ordered Zhu to be detained pending verification of the body.</p>
<h3>A Russian Sold Guns to Bandits; A French Youth Was Involved; After the Arrest of French National Yasannian, the French Consular Court Reprimanded and Released Him</h3>
<p>The "Continental Times" reports that regarding the shootout between police officers and armed bandits at the corner of Shansi Road and Peking Road on February 1, a team of police detectives went to No. 198 McNair Road at 9 am yesterday (the 14th) after obtaining an arrest warrant issued by the French Consulate and arrested French merchant</p>
<p>Yasannian.</p>
<p>Mr. Yasannian, age 20, works for a French silk import company. It is said that the weapons held by the nine bandits arrested in the February 1 shooting case were sold by Mr. Yasannian. Detectives seized a Smith &amp; Wesson pistol in Mr. Yasannian's residence, which was the same type of pistol used by one of the arrested bandits. The French Consular Court held a trial yesterday morning. Mr. Yasannian stated that he sold the pistol to a Russian intermediary and did not know that it would be resold to bandits for illegal purposes. The Consular Court, considering Mr. Yasannian's young age, reprimanded him and then</p>
<p>immediately released him.</p>
<p>Regarding the arms dealing in this case, three Russians have been arrested. One of them, named Nickolayev, has turned over a Luger automatic pistol and another pistol to the police, and stated that the Mauser gun and Smith &amp; Wesson pistol seized by the police from the bandits were purchased from Yasannian for 300 yuan and 80 yuan respectively, and that the</p>
<p>Luger gun</p>
<p>was also Mr. Yasannian's property, sold to the bandits for 180 yuan. The police have seized a total of twelve firearms in this case, after seizing a pistol at Mr. Yasannian's residence yesterday. The three Russians involved in the firearms dealing are still detained in the Central Police Station and will be interrogated by the First Special Court along with the arrested bandits.</p>

<p>Zhou Bangjun, the manager of the China-West Pharmacy, lived at No. 120, Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road. At 1:10 pm on January 25th of this year, four bandits suddenly entered with weapons, intending to take action. The Zhou family's maidservant climbed from the drying platform to the home of lawyer Dan Yuhua next door and telegraphed the Chengdu Road police station, which immediately dispatched a large team of Chinese and Western armed detectives to surround and arrest them.

At 2:30 pm yesterday, all the victims were summoned, and Wang Yizhi and the other seven were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Judge Xiao Peishen took the bench to hear the case. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendants had committed offenses not only in the French Concession, but also one attempted robbery, seven completed robberies, and</p>
<p>fourteen unsuccessful</p>
<p>extortions in the Public Concession. Therefore, they were charged under Articles 330 and 346 of the Criminal Code, etc., and the details of the case were explained in detail to make it easier to understand. The first case, the attempted robbery of Zhou Bangjun's home, was committed by the four defendants Wang Yizhi, Luo Hongxing, He Jun, and Zhou Fusheng. On January 15th of this year, He Jun met a friend, Zhang Dakuaitou, in room 09 of the Daxin Hotel on Edward Road. According to Zhang, the Zhou family was quite wealthy, and Zhou had recently received 20,000 yuan in legal tender, which could be robbed. He agreed. The next day, He went to a silk factory on Jiaozhou Road to visit Wang Yizhi and talk about the robbery of the Zhou family. Wang said that the end of the year was approaching and he was short of money, so he agreed. They then agreed to discuss it the next day at the intersection of Route Robert and Jiaozhou Road. At that time, Wang brought Luo and Zhou. According to Wang, he had three handguns that could be used. Later, he discussed it with Zhang Dakuaitou again on Edward Road and went to Zhou's house on Tongfu Road to scout it out, deciding to</p>
<p>strike at 3 pm</p>
<p>on January 23rd. At that time, because the handguns were not prepared in time, the date was changed to the 25th. They gathered in room 313 of the Daxin Hotel on Edward Road in advance and rented a bicycle from the Jiangxinghe Bicycle Shop at No. 30 Jiaozhou Road and went to rob. That is why they were arrested, etc. Afterwards, Wang Shengquan, the secretary of the China-West Pharmacy, testified, proving that the four defendants were all present at the scene. When Wang, Luo, He, and Zhou were questioned, they all confessed to the robbery. Then Judge Xiao questioned them one by one about the remaining cases. The defendants mostly confessed. It was not until dusk that the court adjourned, and the defendants were detained pending further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>Gao Fengchi Sued by His Grandchildren for Support; Demands a Total of 190,000 Yuan for Living and Education Expenses; Unable to Pay Litigation Costs, Requests Litigation Assistance</h3>
<p>Gao Fengchi, a Shanghai native residing at No. 34, the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour and Avenue Messimy, has recently been sued by his grandchildren Gao Shuren (also known as Kaidi, 11 years old) and Gao Sufei (7 years old), with their mother Gao Wang Youmei (38 years old, native of Dongguan, Guangdong) as their legal representative, and represented by lawyers Yang Linzhi and Wang Jiachuo. They have filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court for the payment of living and education expenses. According to</p>
<p>the statement of claim,</p>
<p>the plaintiffs' father, Gao Pengyun, is the defendant's biological son. He lived with the plaintiffs' mother in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China and had the plaintiffs and their brothers. They are also the defendant's grandsons. Although the plaintiffs' father studied in Europe and America, he had nothing to do after returning to China. All household expenses were paid by their grandfather, the defendant, from the sixteenth year of the Republic of China until the year before last, as evidenced by the defendant's handwritten letters. In the winter of the twenty-seventh year, the plaintiffs' father's personal debts led to the seizure and auction of all household appliances by the court. He was then framed and prosecuted by the court's prosecutor for obstructing official duties and ordered to be wanted, causing the plaintiffs' father to</p>
<p>have nowhere to live</p>
<p>and flee without a trace. Their grandfather not only ignored it but also stopped paying for the plaintiffs' family living expenses. The plaintiffs, forced by economic circumstances, initially borrowed money with their mother to make ends meet, but then the debt burden became too heavy, and they had no way to borrow. They had nowhere to go. In October, they learned that the plaintiffs' father had another small residence at No. 15, Lane 1414, Edward Road, where he lived with his concubine, Miss Fan. They went to beg to stay temporarily, and their mother sent a letter to their grandfather, requesting living expenses as usual. Their grandfather ignored them. Later, their father's residence was discovered and seized by creditors, and the plaintiffs were evicted again. The plaintiffs' mother, with the help of Gong Fenglin, went to see their grandfather in person to request living expenses,</p>
<p>but were scolded</p>
<p>and returned. They had to live temporarily in the countryside of Pudong. Now, they are under the pressure of life and can no longer endure it. On December 3rd, they commissioned a lawyer to send a letter to their grandfather, requesting living and education expenses. The reply was refused. The plaintiffs are the defendant's direct blood relatives, and the defendant should be responsible for providing support. Moreover, since the plaintiffs' father is on the run, the defendant should take care of them. Therefore, they are forced to file a lawsuit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay 500 yuan per month for living expenses until the plaintiffs can support themselves. Calculated over five years, this totals 90,000 yuan. In addition, the education expenses from primary school to studying abroad are estimated at 100,000 yuan, totaling</p>
<p>190,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The defendant owns huge commercial shares and real estate with a total value of no less than several million. The amount requested by the plaintiffs is only a very small part. They request a one-time payment, and state that the plaintiffs are currently in a difficult situation and are unable to pay the litigation costs. They request litigation assistance. Based on the statement, the court held a hearing in Civil Court 1 yesterday, presided over by Judge Ma Yishu. The defendant did not appear. Only the plaintiff's side and their lawyer appeared in court, stating that the defendant's address was not incorrect and that a subpoena could be issued next time. The court ordered that the case be adjourned to the 22nd to await the summons of the defendant for further questioning.</p>
<p>Robbery Notes</p>
<p>On Montauban Road in the Public Concession, at around 9:35 pm last night, a man was stopped by four bandits. Two bandits displayed pistols and robbed the man of his own pistol and several suits of clothes, and then fled. At No. 28, Lane 258, Tangshan Road, Hongkew, at 6:45 pm last night, four bandits broke in. Two of them were armed. As a result, 221 yuan was robbed.</p>
<p>At No. 75, Lane 190, Wuting Road, at 7:15 pm last night, six bandits broke in. Three of them displayed weapons, overturned boxes and ransacked for twenty minutes. However, the losses are unknown.</p>
<h3>Heavy Dew and Severe Frost; Many Bodies of People Freezing to Death on the Streets; An Average of Twenty Bodies Per Day</h3>
<p>Although the local weather has entered spring, the dew is still heavy and the frost is severe in the mornings and evenings. Bodies of people freezing to death on the streets are still everywhere. According to the Pushen Mountain Villa, in the past week, the hall has collected and buried an average of twenty bodies of people freezing to death on the streets every day. This does not include the bodies of children.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, According to the statement of my client, Mr. Chuan Fengying, the news item in the local section of today's "Shen Xin" and "Er Bao" newspapers regarding the liquidation office of the Tong Tai Shun Ji Money Shop suing for debt is entirely based on the plaintiff's statement of claim and does not conform to the facts. My late father, Yu Jinggong, passed away long ago. He was engaged in business in Shanghai for several decades and had an outstanding reputation, which was praised by his peers. He never defaulted on debts. The Tong Tai Shop has been closed for five years, and it is difficult to understand the true intention of suddenly filing a lawsuit for debt at this time. It concerns the reputation of my late father, and I request that you correct it in a letter, etc. Therefore, I am sending this on his behalf, hoping that you will make the correction. Respectfully, Lawyer Wu Chu, January 15, 1940.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory predicted at 4:30 pm yesterday that the weather around Shandong is sunny and cloudy, relatively warm, with morning fog and no fixed wind direction. Here and in the East China Sea, there is a rather strong north to east wind. Also, in the 24 hours before 2:00 pm yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 57.6 and the lowest was 31.5. On the same day last year, the highest was 48.2 and the lowest was 28.8.</p>

<h3>Finance Speculators' Flames Rekindle: Gold Creates an Unprecedented Peak, Appearing at a New Price of $4,880, Counteracting the Sterling Settlement by More Than $70</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash "shá chì" (speculation) grey market situation rose sharply again, endlessly, even breaking the peak of $4,820 on August 11 of last year, suddenly appearing at $4,880 again, creating an astonishing record in the history of the gold market. In reality, it is because the foreign exchange market continues to tighten, the desire to buy gold has rekindled, and in addition, the wealthy merchants of this city have a mentality that buying gold can make a fortune, disregarding everything, thus creating a terrifying situation. Upon investigation, although the foreign exchange has been shrinking recently, since the red market for gold prices, it has already soared by more than $475. Assuming a foreign exchange ratio, the gold price increase is excessive. According to the evening closing price of British gold, it was $4,790, which has already counteracted by $75. The settlement price for the U.S. dollar was $5,070, only pressing down about $200. As for the Hong Kong group, although they keep on buying, it is said that the gold price in this city is already higher than the gold price in that area, so it may contain speculative elements, and the future is difficult to predict. The morning opening jumped $38, to $4,650. Subsequently, money changers and securities firms entered the market to buy strongly, and the buying trend rekindled, leaping to $4,730. In the afternoon, the tight situation in the foreign exchange market intensified, and the Tianjin and Hong Kong groups secretly made rapid progress, and large households continued to increase their positions, while sellers took the opportunity to raise prices. Until the evening closing, an unprecedented new high of $4,880 appeared. Afterwards, a certain money changer profited and then sold, closing at $4,865. As a result, it rose sharply by $253 compared with the previous day. The entire day's transactions were very active, with more than 3,000 taels. Silver ornaments also rose by $20, also creating a record high of $490. Customs gold, etc., remained flat.</p>
<p>Speculation Jumps Up $253</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), although the initial foreign exchange market was flat, buyers still flocked in. The opening rose by $38. A securities firm entered 50 taels of gold, at $4,650. Afterwards, money changers sold, and at the same time, silver firms and a certain "ming hao" (name brand) also sold, so it returned down $30. Money changers did 50 taels between themselves, at $4,620. At that time, a certain bank suddenly came to buy in, and it rose step by step. After that, a certain money changer and securities firm buying trend suddenly rose, and it was heard that they were all on behalf of customers, so it aroused retail investors to follow suit. In addition, at this time, there was a lack of sellers, and it immediately jumped across, leaping over the $4,700 mark. A certain silver firm entered 20 taels from a money changer, at $4,730. However, the rise in strength was inevitable, and the foreign exchange returned to flat after tightening. In addition, the buying trend was not sustained, causing profit-takers to sell. Silver firms selling intentions were even stronger, and soon it fell back by $40. Yu Hao sold 30 taels to a money changer, down to $4,690. Finally, a certain money changer restarted the selling trend, and the foreign exchange market softened again, rising again by $25. A money changer entered 20 taels of cash, for $4,715. At noon, securities firm bulls re-emerged, so it returned down $10. A securities firm sold 30 taels to a money changer, for $4,705. Later, a money changer entered 40 taels from a securities firm, at $4,710 as the afternoon closing price. The afternoon situation was firm and strong, opening up $20. Money changers did 30 taels between themselves, at $4,730. A little later, the foreign exchange market reported tightening, and a certain money changer and securities firm worked hard to enter, raising it up $30 again. Money changers did 20 taels between themselves, at $4,760. After a period of stability, unexpectedly, at about 3 o'clock, the foreign exchange tightened further, the buying trend was historically strong. A certain gold shop and money changer and a certain silver firm rushed to buy wildly, although a certain bank took the opportunity to release on behalf of the bulls, the positions were still seeking more than supply several times, leaping up another $120. Securities firms traded 10 taels between themselves, at $4,880. Afterwards, a certain money changer turned from buying to selling, and at the same time, floating bulls also followed suit and sold, so the rising trend was suddenly frustrated, dropping slightly by $25. A money changer sold 40 taels to a gold shop, for $4,855. Later, the gold shop re-entered, jumping $10, entering 30 taels from a certain cash shop, for $4,865 as the evening closing price. As a result, it rose sharply by $253 compared with the previous day, and has risen a total of $465 since the opening of the customs. The entire day rose and fell by $260.</p>
<p>Ornaments Listed at $490</p>
<p>Silver jewelry, the asking price per tael, initially the Datong firm still listed $465. Then, at 10 o'clock, it listed up $5, at 11 o'clock it listed up another $5, at 2:13 in the afternoon, it listed up another $5, at 3:10 it listed up another $5, at 3:25 it listed up another $5, a total of $25, creating a record high price of $490. The purchase price was reduced by $15 to $20.</p>
<h3>U.S. Dollar Notes Above $14</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies rose sharply. British and American gold pounds were affected by the sharp increase in speculation. Market prices soared. British and American gold notes rose early in the morning. U.S. dollar notes rose to $14.17. There was little maneuvering along the way. In the afternoon market, British gold notes were $52.25, and U.S. dollar notes were $14.08. In the afternoon, the rising trend was historically strong. The bulls absorbed unremittingly, and market prices rose, without any upper limit, re-presenting last year's panic phenomenon. Hong Kong notes and French franc notes, etc., were lacking in supply. The Italian notes, Australian gold notes, and Siamese notes, which had been inactive for a long time, also tended to be active and rise. The tightening of Japanese yen notes slowed slightly. The evening market was $1.298. Korean notes continued to be firm. The evening market was $1.06. Yesterday's market prices, British and American gold pounds both rose $7.5. British gold notes rose $1.65. U.S. dollar notes rose $0.53, to $14.50. Hong Kong notes rose $0.07. French franc notes rose $0.007. Singapore notes and Dutch notes both rose $0.3.

<h3>Cash Soars: Suddenly Causes Foreign Exchange Buying Trend, HSBC Listing Shrinks in Afternoon, U.S. Dollar Already Enters $7 Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the HSBC listing, announced at 9:30, with no ups and downs. When the announcement came at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, British gold suddenly listed shrinking by 125, calculated as 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 125. The U.S. dollar was changed to shrink 25, calculated as $6.75. The others were also changed to shrink. The grey market of British and American exchange was again in a tight situation. The U.S. dollar has entered the $7 mark, and also created a new tight price this year. This is actually due to the many settlement shares in the foreign firm circles, and the lack of supply intentions of Hong Kong Electric and HSBC, etc. As for the usual process, the morning opening was flat. Then, Qiao Zhifu first came to buy in, plus a small number of Chinese merchants followed up. Although Chinese firms frequently came to sell out, the positions still felt insufficient, so it immediately reported soft. Subsequently, Sassoon bulls emerged, and exporters also came to sell out, so the market situation saw a return to flat. However, soon Hong Kong Electric suddenly came to buy in, and in addition, British and American tobacco companies also had settlements, and it re-reported tight and soft. At noon, the buying trend had subsided, so until the afternoon closing, it was slightly firm, at 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 28125 and $7.0625. In the afternoon, due to the soaring cash, it suddenly caused a fierce buying trend. The foreign firm circles continued to buy and settle, but fortunately HSBC was still willing to supply at the time, so the tight situation was still slow at the time. Unexpectedly, HSBC suddenly turned from selling to buying, so the foreign firm circles and a small number of Chinese merchants saw the scene and came to search again, and other foreign firms were extremely indifferent to supply, so until the close, it tightened straight to 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 1875 and $7.875. As a result, it tightened 125 and 25 compared with the previous day. The forward potential is on the same path as the spot.</p>
<p>Qiao Zhifu First Bought and Settled</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the London big bars, recently shrunk 275, long-term fell 3125. The New York silver price was still flat, and London raw gold was fixed. The HSBC exchange rates for British, American, Shanghai, and French, etc., were flat. The U.S. dollar to British fell 1 "fen" 125, to Shanghai fell $0.2, to French small 625. The Central Bank listed each exchange rate as before. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were British gold 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 3125, and U.S. dollar $7.125. Compared with the previous close, both were without honor or disgrace. After opening, the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu came to buy and settle, but fortunately the Chinese firms still had intentions to supply, so the market was not affected. It is estimated that Qiao Zhifu settled into the Chinese firms' spot U.S. dollar $7.125. The HSBC listing announcement did not move. The white silver balancing tax announcement fell $0.02. After that, Chinese merchants also followed up on activities, and there were also both profits and eating stomachs, so the market situation reported soft. It is estimated that Qiao Zhifu and a small number of speculators and Youli, etc., mutually purchased and accepted the Chinese firms, Zhejiang and a certain firm's March U.S. dollar, and the prices were all $6.9375. At this time, the spot price softened to 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 28125 and $7.0625. Later, a certain firm was quite willing to supply for the upper price, and soon the exporter suddenly came to sell out, and at the same time, Sassoon also came to sell spot, so the market image returned to bullish. It is estimated that Sassoon sold to foreign firms' spot British gold 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 3125, and exporters sold to a certain firm spot U.S. dollar $7.125. At that time, speculators also sold to foreign firms this month's U.S. dollar $7.09375. Subsequently, Hong Kong Electric suddenly came to buy in, and the British and American Tobacco Company also had a slight settlement, so the situation re-reported tight and soft. It is estimated that Hong Kong Electric bought into foreign firms' spot British gold 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 28125, and the British and American Tobacco Company purchased the cabinet of Feng's spot U.S. dollar $7.03125. After this, the tightest would call over 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 25 and $7. At noon, the buying trend had subsided, so the situation reported turn to flat. Until the closing, British gold was 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 28125, and U.S. dollar $7.0625, compared with the morning opening, British tight 03125, and U.S. soft 0625.</p>
<p>HSBC Enters Spot British Gold</p>
<p>The initial post-market opening was still flat. Suddenly, the foreign firm circles first came to settle in, but HSBC still had intentions to supply, so the tight situation was eased. It is estimated that the foreign firm bought into HSBC U.S. dollar $7.03125 and $7. At the same time, Chinese merchants also purchased a certain firm's this month's U.S. dollar $7. Unexpectedly, at 3 o'clock, HSBC suddenly turned from selling to buying, buying Chinese firms and the same industry spot British gold, (it is said that tens of thousands of pounds), the price was called 265625 and 25. In addition, at that time, the foreign firm circles came to buy wildly again, and the Chinese merchants continued to move slightly, and foreign firms' selling intentions were extremely weak, so the tightness of the market accelerated, and the U.S. dollar immediately broke into the $7 mark. Soon, the HSBC listing also reported shrinking 125 and 25. It is estimated that the foreign firm settled in foreign firms' March U.S. dollar $6.875. Until the evening closing, it is estimated that the current sterling was 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 1875, February called 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 171875, March 4 "ban shi" (shillings) 125, the current U.S. dollar was $6.875, February $6.84375, March $6.75, compared with the previous day's noon closing, British tight 125, and U.S. tight 25.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Rises $4</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 15th Telegram. This morning, the exchange market opened and reported flat. The British exchange current futures are still not moving. The U.S. exchange spot is tight 125, for $24.5. The Shanghai exchange spot rises $4. The Japanese exchange spot shrinks 375, for $104. At 9:55, the Central Bank exchange spot fell back $2, for $344. At 11:30, it was stable. Each exchange rate had no changes in general. The noon closing reported flat. The Shanghai exchange spot rebounded $3, for $347. At 2:30 in the afternoon, the opening was flat. The British exchange and Japanese exchange had no honor or disgrace. The U.S. exchange spot loosened 0625, for $24.5625. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped again $1, for $346.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rate Still Loose</p>
<p>Tianjin, 15th Telegram. This morning, the exchange market opening was still sluggish. The British exchange spot loosened 03125, for 3 "bian shi" (pence) 78125. The U.S. exchange spot sold out 0625, for $6.25. The Shanghai exchange rate did not move, still at $114. The "United Notes" grey market was cheap another $1.5, for $106.</p>
<h3>Grain Foreign Rice Still Expensive, Japonica and Indica Even More Expensive</h3>
<p>After the rice market saw a slight decline the day before yesterday, at yesterday's opening, the general consensus was that seeing the drastic changes in the market, there were many concerns, and they did not dare to make great progress rashly, and they all held a wait-and-see attitude, so the early market situation was unusually sluggish. Regardless of retail or wholesale, there were few inquiries. Only the sellers still hoarded and did not sell, and the prudent ones had money to earn, and there were also those who sold out, so the Saigon "huǒ wén" (fire pattern) market all fell by $0.3 to $0.5. Near noon, it was suddenly heard that the exchange rate had shrunk again, and the general merchants' hearts were resolute for acceptance again. In a short time, they competed to buy each other, and the cries of the merchants rose again, and the market immediately returned to being expensive. Until the close, it was tired first and then tight, which can be said to be the stereotype. Saigon fire squeeze and Dongbei sharp, etc., all had not much rise or fall compared with the previous market. However, Bai Yuan had the lowest market price, and the road to go became wide, and only 2-3 cars of Danyang goods arrived, so the price continued to rise. Danyang Bai Yuan was sold for $45. As for the thick and thin japonica rice and other national rice, they were already open secrets. Since the foreign rice price has reached this peak of $50, how can the "dù mǐ" (Du rice) bear to sell according to the limit? They are all outside the market, opening a grey market. It was heard that yesterday Kunshan japonica rice was sold for $55, and thin rice was sold for $52. As to whether this is fact, only go to the market to investigate.</p>
<p>The rise and fall of foreign rice yesterday was uneven. The buying sentiment in the early market was extremely strong. No. 1 Saigon rose from $48.50 to $49.80. Subsequently, due to firm orders and previous orders arriving in Shanghai, the sellers were more willing to sell, returning to $49. In the afternoon, affected by the shrinking exchange rate and rising gold, the price rose again to the $50 mark. The morning market of returned goods was flat, and in the afternoon, the buyers were enthusiastic, and the sellers took the opportunity to shout high. The market suddenly became chaotic. The previous opening small squeeze and No. 2 Siam at $55.35 were all shouted up to $56, $57, and $58, although there were no formal transactions, people's hearts were even more shaken. New transactions were set for 5,000 tons of small squeeze at $55.30, and 2,700 tons of No. 2 Siam at $55.50. However, new negotiations in the afternoon are difficult to approach.</p>
<h3>Flour Prices Secretly Rise Endlessly, Japanese Factories Collect Wheat</h3>
<p>Flour secretly rose endlessly yesterday. Upon investigation, the wholesale price on this street is nominally $10 for the original package, but at the market, it is not easy to buy this kind of responsibility at the factory price of $10. This responsibility is at the factory or at the store, and it is impossible to say. On the contrary, the returned goods are hoarding and raising prices every day. The selling price of "lv" (green) car stack tickets has reached $15.30, also creating a new record. The remaining "bing chuan" (military ship) and old car stack tickets also raised prices at the same time. However, this kind of transaction is neither a formal market nor a grey market. It was heard that the factory has been secretly buying in order to limit the further rise in flour prices, so the Japanese factory flour, Fengfeng brand, has also been raised to $14.60. In addition, the Beiyang group wholesale prices for Hong Caishén and Hong Taohua, etc., purchased from Fuxin and Fufeng are still $13, and each transaction has thousands of bags.</p>
<p>Wheat was firm and stable as usual yesterday, because there were few sellers in the market, and they were unwilling to sell unless they reached a considerable selling price. A certain Japanese factory collected more than ten cars of Su Chang and other wheat, and the price was $23. On the Chinese factory side, in addition to the goods directly sent to the factory, there has been no formal delivery.</p>
<h3>Bran Also Hoarding</h3>
<p>Bran has been rising continuously with flour and wheat for several days.</p>
<p>It is estimated that there are still more than 100,000 bags stored in Mulishen, but most of them are controlled by hoarders, who firmly refuse to sell. Yesterday, the Fuxin factory sold 5,000 bags, and the price reached an unprecedented high of $15, a huge increase of $2 compared to the total settlement account before the father. There were also nearly 1,000 bags of returned goods transactions. In addition to a small number of needs taken by the inland group, the road to go is mainly hoarders. (Ren)</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Speculation Concentrated, Yarn Market Soars, Double Horse Reaches $844</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to rise, and the rising trend was extremely fierce. This is because gold is soaring, and the foreign exchange market is tightening. People's hearts are panic-stricken, and the buying trend is fierce. According to the market, securities, gold, and stock market dealers are all dispatched, and the public is selling into it, so the yarn market is soaring. This kind of rising trend is quite terrifying.</p>
<p>At the opening of the spot yarn market this morning, although the foreign exchange market was stable, there was a crowd of buyers in the market. 20-count Double Horse rose $10. Subsequently, with the buyers still enthusiastic, it rose $10 again, and the price was $832-33. This price hovered for a long time. When it was almost 11 o'clock, it was heard that the exchange notes had turned firm, and the wind on the table was extremely strong, advancing step by step, jumping $17-18. The price of 20-count Double Horse was $844, the highest closing price. It is estimated that 3,115 bales were traded in half a day. The market for 20-count Double Horse rose $30. Today, there are 3 pieces of yarn shipped to Hong Kong and 107 pieces shipped to Xiamen. The amount purchased by each group is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Same industry 2,180, mainland 70, Hong Kong 50</p>
<p>Xiamen 3, Sichuan 20, Statistics 3,125</p>
<h3>Cotton Also Jumps Madly, Tong Cotton Reaches $190</h3>
<p>The transaction of local cotton is even more developed, and the buying and selling among the same industry is especially lively. Because the yarn market is soaring, the foreign exchange market is shrinking, and the speculative transactions are extremely excited, the market price is advancing step by step. Tong cotton has risen to $190, an increase of $6-7 compared with the previous day. However, the factory's needs have not risen, and the source of Northern Jiangsu has not been fulfilled. The transaction situation of the spot cotton is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Another message: foreign cotton market prices. In the New York cotton market, the morning initially rose due to purchases by speculators, and later rose due to purchases by the same industry and short covering. As a result, the closing price rose more than ten "bang yin" compared with the previous day. India forecast an increase of three rupees, Egypt an increase of more than ten "bang yin", and Liverpool an increase of 7-8 pence.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton transaction, yesterday the foreign cotton transaction was quite active due to the soaring price of cotton yarn. The purchasing intentions of all parties were very strong, especially the same industry. The transaction was extremely lively. The factory's purchasing intentions were relatively weak. The market's inventory of Indian cotton was almost searched empty, and even the loaded ones had already started trading. The total transaction amount yesterday was about 3,000 bales. Yesterday afternoon, the exchange rate tightened again, so the general prediction is that cotton prices will continue to soar. The following is the factory price converted from the U.S. dollar $7 for yesterday's cotton market.</p>
<h3>Securities Foreign Stocks Once Excited, Domestic Debt Quite Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the securities grey market trend was still firm, rising slightly. However, because gold continued to rise, exceeding the previous highest price, many parties have been issuing public debt for this reason. After the close, the price returned down slightly. However, the reason for the rise in gold is because there is a rumor of issuing treasury bills. The reason for the return and loosening of public debt is only related to people's hearts, and has nothing to do with the overall situation. In this situation of inflation, there is no reason for public debt to fall. Those who hold goods recognize that it is not necessary, so there is a dazed and uncertain situation. Yesterday, Lian Yi Tai bought hard, and there was quite a stomach. Retail investors also purchased. Although under the selling pressure of No. 64 and Lian He Yong Feng Run Li, etc., it was still able to rise a few corners slightly, which shows that public debt has a small return. The market price results were slightly better by $0.2 to $0.45. The total number of transactions was about $500,000. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 200 shares of Hanyeping were traded, and the price was $3 per share, rising a few corners compared to before. 200 shares of Chinese Business Electric shares, the price was $7 cash.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the stock market of the Public Industry Association, because the opening of Hongkou was progressing smoothly, the opening was unusually excited. The stocks of Shanghai Yeh Kwong Land and China Business Company became the target of public criticism, and the price fluctuated greatly, and the transaction was extremely large. The decision of International Trust shares also had an amazing rising trend. The transactions at the disparate prices totaled more than 80,000 shares. Various profit-taking stocks were absorbed easily, like waving feathers. Rubber stocks were silent at the opening, but later, because the foreign exchange market reported tight, the buyers were enthusiastic, and the closing was also extremely firm.</p>
<p>London 14th Daily Drama. Today's listing of Chinese foreign debt shows that the English issued bond tickets for the aftermath loan continued to fall by half a pound, and the price was 40 pounds. The rest was flat.</p>
<p>London, 14th Telegram. Today's listing of stocks of British Far East companies was generally stable. Only HSBC Bank shares fell by half a pound. The British registered shares were 85 pounds, the Hong Kong registered shares were 87 pounds, and the rest did not move.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes, Raw Soybean Oil Only Rise, No Fall</h3>
<p>The oil market fluctuated quite a bit yesterday. In the early morning, soybean oil hoarders tried to release (because the deadline for delivery), the opening fell $2. Afterwards, because the raw oil took a step and soared, and was constrained by the exchange rate, people's hearts became tense again, and the market price went up in circles. As a result, it repeated the original market price of the previous day. It is estimated that 450 barrels of Dalian crude oil were traded, and the price rose from $116 to $118. 50 barrels of Jiangbei oil were $115.50, 100 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were $87, 50 pieces of Yanqi oil were $91, 50 pieces of Qingqi oil were $89, and 200 dan of this factory's oil were $98. Peanut oil reported an increase in production prices, and the arrival and storage were rare, so the potential was sharp, and the market price soared step by step. Jiaozhou oil rose from $93 to $95, and more than 300 pieces were traded. 40 barrels of Jiangbei barrel oil, 300 tins of tin oil, 500 tins of Yantai tin oil, 300 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil were ordered to be delivered in March, and the price rose from $123 to $125.</p>
<p>On the 16th, 340 packages of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen, 4,100 packages were shipped to Hong Kong, and 759 packages were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Silk Market Tired and Unable to Prosper</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market, the trend in Japan and the United States was weak. New York recently fell $0.11, long-term fell $0.115. Yokohama spot fell $50, long-term fell $54. The local silk market was therefore tired and unable to prosper. The price of B-character Fa Zhuang silk from the Bai factory was $4,800, and $4,850 to $4,900 for 7-8 points. It is estimated that Dachang and others entered 30 dan. In the afternoon, the Yokohama silk market closing rebounded, and Baitou Foreign Firm's Qianjin silk entered and the stomach was not weak. Yesterday, 30 dan were traded, and the price was $1,800, the same as the previous market. On the 16th, 102 packages of silk warp were shipped to Hong Kong, and 8 pieces were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Sugar Prices Stepping Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to expand again due to the continued shrinking of foreign exchange. The Association's drawing disk spot was $1.7 to $1.2 higher for 24 coarse white, $63.2 for this stack, $63 for the new arrival in the foreign stack, $62.5 for the old goods, and $2 higher for the transshipment goods, which was $50. Taikoo car white also rose about $1. The West stack B mark was $63, CW mark was $62.5, CX mark and DY mark were $62, and HX mark was $61.5. The East stack goods were discounted $0.5 to $0.3, and H mark car red was $45 for the West stack and $44.5 for the East stack, an increase of $1. The Dutch red MP mark was $47.8, and the WH mark was $47.3. This cotton white increased by half a yuan, the snow white was $63, and the ice increase degree was the same, No. 1 was $74, and Jingming ice was $75.5. The national essence market was also strong. Jianbang opened 1,800 packages of Diao Qing, $45. Xinghua called the number of cases of Xinghua Qing, $41.5. The Guangbang opened more than 100 pieces of Dongxiang red, $42, an increase of $1. 30 pieces of Tiao Qing, $40, an increase of about $3 (all cash).</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Gather Branch Hand Goods No Intention to Sell Cheap</h3>
<p>Because the arrival of the gathered branches is lacking, those who have hand goods have no intention of selling immediately, and the asking price is high, which is more than $10 worse than last year. It is expected that there will be a chance to loosen only when the source is seen to increase.</p>
<h3>First Opening of Tree Fungus Red and Black Dates</h3>
<p>The first market of Tianjin red dates opened with dozens of packages of Leling goods, with the date head at $55, the first household at $45, the second household at $35, and 196 packages of Tongjin red at $31.5, and 40 packages of Tong black dates at $40.</p>
<p>Because there is no continuation of the source of the Sichuan goods of black tree fungus, the high goods opened at $350, the ordinary Shanghai Sichuan Yong brand was $315, and the mouth fungus was $310.</p>
<h3>Red Rice Soars $10</h3>
<p>Recently, because Hong Kong has been acting, the market stock of red rice has become thin day by day. The current market has reached $95 to $90, and it is heard that the after-market will continue to tighten, or it will come out of the $100 mark.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Tibetan Huate Ni is the Most Popular</h3>
<p>Tibetan Green Huate Ni is exceptionally short of spot goods, and sales are extremely smooth. The orders from the East and West foreign firms have not arrived in Shanghai. Shanghai's production is expensive and difficult to import. Yihé Factory has absolutely no large quantities coming out, and Japanese factories such as Yongxing Hongkang Gongda have also not produced anything. Only domestic factories such as Dalu, Dahua, Dalong, Yinfeng, and Xiexin have slightly spun out, and the current wholesale price per yard has risen to $10.</p>

<h3>Responding to the "Reduce Book Prices Movement" of Chengdu Middle School Students</h3>
<p>— A Middle School Student Yao</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>After reading the Chengdu dispatch in the Education section of your newspaper on February 14th, I couldn't help but feel deeply sympathetic. I'm taking time out of my busy schedule to write this letter, requesting that you publish it to support the "Reduce Book Prices Movement" and help us poor students. I hope you will accept our little bit of hardship.</p>
<p>The students of twenty-three middle schools in Chengdu have initiated and organized the "Reduce Book Prices Movement" due to the high cost of books and the difficulty in pursuing education. We believe this movement is urgently needed; especially on the isolated island in the current situation, it is even more closely related.</p>
<p>Before the war, a book priced at one yuan could usually be bought at a 30% or 20% discount. In the weeks before school started, one could even enjoy a 40% discount, so a book originally priced at one yuan could be purchased for just sixty cents. Now, it's completely different. A book originally priced at one yuan now has its price increased and an additional 30% or 50% added on top. As a result, what could originally be bought for sixty cents now costs almost three times as much. This accelerated price increase is truly frightening!</p>
<p>As a high school student, I need at least eleven or twelve yuan for books and supplies each semester (and most of them are still old books purchased from used bookstores), excluding the reference books I usually buy. This semester, because it's the last half year before graduation, I need to buy very few new books, less than a third of the number I bought last semester. However, even including stationery, it still cost me ten yuan, fifty-eight cents. If it were a second-year high school student, the cost of books alone would probably be twenty or thirty yuan, right?</p>
<p>In this era of soaring prices, it is usually said that the price of books naturally has to increase due to "costs," but we still request that booksellers reduce book prices as much as possible within the possible range, to reduce the burden on us poor students.</p>
<p>At the same time, we also request that the school increase the printing and distribution of lecture notes and reduce unnecessary books. Finally, we hope that all parties will give us strong support with the enthusiasm of caring for their own children's education, to respond to the "Reduce Book Prices Movement" and earnestly promote it. I won't talk anymore, I wish you well. A Middle School Student Yao</p>
<h3>Talking About Rice Prices</h3>
<p>— Qing Tong</p>
<p>Due to the hoarding and manipulation of rice by rice weevils, the rice market opened on a red plate, and the prices of all rice exceeded the price limit of forty yuan; the black market even had prices above fifty yuan.</p>
<p>I read the "New Copy of an Old Newspaper from 167 Years Ago" in your newspaper the other day, which recorded that Ning Qun said that due to "continuous rain and snow for a long time," "firewood and rice prices rose sharply," and "the best white rice cost 4,800 cash per shi, and the next best also cost 4,600 cash," which was already called "rice as pearls and firewood as cinnamon." Compared to today, it is simply incomparable.</p>
<p>I also saw a note about rice prices that said: "According to past history, rice prices have always been more expensive than cheap. This can be seen from the following records. During the Wu-Yue period, rice cost only a few dozen cash per shi. In the fifth year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, the fields yielded a great harvest, and a shi of rice cost four qian of silver. In the twenty-seventh year of the Qianlong reign, rice production was particularly abundant, and a dou of rice cost less than one hundred cash. And at that time, 1,000 cash per dou of rice in the ninth year of the Shaoxing reign of the Song Dynasty was already considered expensive. In the twenty-fourth year of the Jiajing reign of the Ming Dynasty, one shi of rice cost 1.6 liang of silver; in the forty-first year, a dou of rice cost 170 cash; in the Wuzi year of the Wanli reign, a dou of rice cost two qian of silver; in the fourteenth year of the Chongzhen reign, a dou of rice cost four qian of silver; in the eighth year of the Shunzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, each shi cost four liang of silver; in the eighteenth year of the Kangxi reign, each shi cost 1.4 liang of silver; in the thirteenth year of the Qianlong reign, a dou of rice cost 200 cash; in the twentieth year, a dou of rice cost 250 cash; in the fifty-first year, a dou of rice cost 560 cash. In the third year of the Daoguang reign, there was a major flood, and a dou of rice also cost 560 cash; in the twenty-ninth year, it was also expensive due to the flood, costing 40 cash per dou. In the first year of the Tongzhi reign, the war had just ended, and a shi of rice sold for 12,500 cash. And the most expensive was 5,000 cash per dou of rice in the first year of the Tianjian reign of Emperor Wu of Liang, which is only seen in history."</p>
<p>The current price of rice cannot be compared not only with "what was considered expensive at the time," but also with the "5,000 cash per dou," which is "only seen in history." On the one hand, it is certainly said that it is because of the different standards of living in each era, but fifty yuan is one hundred and fifty thousand cash, and one hundred and fifty thousand cash for one dan of rice, I am afraid that no one in history would have imagined it!</p>
<p>During the Tongzhi reign, Duo Qun's "rice as pearls and firewood as cinnamon" was already "difficult for the villagers to eat daily." On the "isolated island" with such high rice prices, how can the low-salary clerks live? We still hope that the criticism of public opinion and the sanctions of the concession authorities can make the speculation and hoarding of rice weevils slightly restrained; at the same time, we look forward to all parties being able to discuss the most appropriate way to stabilize people's food!</p>
<p>Life Report</p>
<h3>Apprentice in a Tailor Shop</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhuo</p>
<p>Although it is a short question and answer, it includes the general living conditions of a group of oppressed people under Shanghai's abnormal prosperity. Below is that conversation:</p>
<p>"How old are you? Where are you from?" I began to ask him.</p>
<p>"I'm from Taizhou, eleven years old."</p>
<p>"How are your meals, drinks, and living?"</p>
<p>"Sir! Can you imagine? I sleep at twelve o'clock every night, and I have to get up at four o'clock. If the work is busy, it is common to sleep at two o'clock. As for eating, I only eat the leftovers from the boss and master. Two meals a day, porridge in the morning and rice in the afternoon."</p>
<p>"What do you do every day?"</p>
<p>"Alas," I work from morning to night every day, without a moment's rest. After getting up, I first light the fire to boil water, and then go to the vegetable market to sell vegetables. After selling vegetables, the master and boss are almost up, so I quickly fold their bedding. The person who empties the chamber pot comes again. After washing the chamber pot, it is already dawn, and someone has already come to find work. In this moment of respite, I also have to take care of the boss's children. Otherwise, I have to burn the iron, deliver clothes, or stand next to the master to learn some skills, but there are very few such times."</p>
<p>"Since it's so hard, why don't you do other jobs and learn tailoring?"</p>
<p>"Sir! You don't know our hardships! My father entrusted many people to get me into this tailor shop! Moreover, there is also a contract, which says that I am not allowed to quit work and go home until I have completed my apprenticeship. The boss is not responsible if the apprentice is sick or lost (the author's note: I am afraid that the apprentice will escape after being abused and their family will investigate), so I have to endure it, what can I do?"</p>
<p>"So what is the treatment after you complete your apprenticeship?"</p>
<p>"Very little! If I stay in the old shop, one jiao a day; if I go to another shop, I might be able to earn two or three jiao a day. Maybe you think we earn too little, sir! You have to know that our master only earns six or seven jiao a day!"</p>
<h3>"Diligent Study Flag"</h3>
<p>— Ye Shuo</p>
<p>The middle school my younger brother attends and the elementary school my younger sister attends both started classes on December 1st of the lunar calendar year.</p>
<p>On the 7th, which was Lunar New Year's Eve, at 4:00 PM, my younger sister came home from elementary school with a notice from the school, which read: "Dear Parents, our school will be closed for three days starting from the 8th," and so on.</p>
<p>My younger brother's school did not have a holiday. On the morning of the Lunar New Year, he still went to school with his schoolbag as usual. Unexpectedly, after an hour, he returned home and said to me: "Many students came to school, but the teachers were not all there. We only had the first class. The teachers in charge of the following classes did not come, so they had to tell us to go home."</p>
<p>In the above two situations, the former "openly taking a holiday" is already very inappropriate, while the latter "informal holiday" is even more wrong. During the Lunar New Year, middle school students "skipping school" is a matter for the students themselves and will not harm the whole, but if teachers "skip teaching," it will affect all the students. This is obviously quite wrong in terms of the teacher's conscience and private morality, and the loss of students' time is secondary!</p>
<p>Therefore, I advocate that the "Diligent Study Flag" should first be given to the teachers, no, perhaps it should be called the "Diligent Teaching Flag."</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 20: Global Transportation, Common Language, Children's Education, Scholarship for Talented and Compassionate</p>
<p>When Ye Songfen's family wanted to replace the newspaper delivery person, their maid said: "The little newspaper delivery person next door delivers the newspaper much earlier. Sometimes we just get up and go to the stove to start the coal stove, and we already hear him knocking on the back door next door, and the newspaper has already been delivered. And no matter if it's sunny or rainy, he always delivers it at that time. Sometimes it rains very heavily, and he would rather his own body get wet, but he wraps the newspaper in his pocket so that it doesn't get wet." Mrs. Ye said: "Then we'll have him deliver it after we come here. Old Zhang Ma! You get up early, so pay attention! Tomorrow, when the newspaper is delivered next door, you can tell him." Old Zhang Ma agreed. The next day, she opened the back door and waited for him. When the newspaper delivery person next door had left, Old Zhang Ma shouted inside the back door: "Hey! Little newspaper delivery person! Little newspaper delivery person!" Jiang Jingrong was most afraid that the Ye family would have any contact with him. He pretended not to hear and ran away with the newspaper. Old Zhang Ma thought it was bad. If she didn't stop him, her mistress would blame her. So she ran out in a hurry, grabbed Jiang Jingrong, and said: "Little newspaper delivery person! Can your ears hear? We want one copy of Shen Bao and one copy of Zhongmei Daily every day. You deliver them at this time every day." Jiang Jingrong said, "This..." Old Zhang Ma said: "There's no this or that. Isn't it convenient for you to deliver newspapers to the next door every day?" Jiang Jingrong said, "Don't you have a newspaper delivery person already? I'm afraid he won't agree." Old Zhang Ma said, "It doesn't matter! Because he delivers it too late, my mistress told me to ask you to deliver it. We like whoever we want to deliver it, so we'll have them deliver it. How can he not agree?" Jiang Jingrong said, "Then there are only a few days left until the end of the month. Let me deliver it from the beginning of next month." For Jiang Jingrong, it was a delaying tactic. Fortunately, they wanted me to deliver the newspaper, but they didn't know who I was. Who knew that when Old Zhang Ma went to report to her mistress, Ye Songfen happened to be by his mother's side. Old Zhang Ma liked to talk a lot. She said: "This morning, I already told the little newspaper delivery person, and he said he would deliver it from next month." After a pause, she said again: "This little newspaper delivery person is about the same age as our young master and has come out to deliver newspapers." After a pause, she said again: "This little newspaper delivery person has a face that is a bit similar to the Jiang family's young master, who used to come here and was a friend of our young master. But the Jiang family's young master is a bit fatter, and he seems a bit thinner." Mrs. Ye didn't pay attention. Ye Songfen changed his mind. He thought: Jiang Jingrong, I wrote several letters to him, but he never replied. He didn't even tell me which middle school he went to. I heard that his family is very poor. Could this newspaper delivery person be him? (238)</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Revising Popular Song Lyrics</h3>
<p>— Chen Shu</p>
<p>Songs have a great influence on society. They can penetrate the people, influence the masses, and educate the masses. I am specifically raising the issue of revising popular song lyrics here for discussion. Most of the current so-called popular songs are love songs, which instill a lot of toxins into the minds of young people and children. Many of the unfortunate situations in society today are caused by these songs!</p>
<p>Speaking of why songs become popular, there are probably only two reasons: one is that the melody is pleasant to the ear, and the other is that the lyrics suit the tastes of the general public. Looking at the popular songs today, we can see how low the general public's tastes are. Regarding this point, it is really necessary to blame the singing circles in the past. Here, we should especially ask the current singing circles to take responsibility for correcting the situation. In addition, I must also appeal to everyone to recognize the times, recognize the responsibility of each individual, and quickly correct the erroneous views of the past!</p>
<p>Not long ago, someone changed "When Will You Return" to "When Will You Not Return," and "Lotus Drop" to "Wounded Soldier Lotus Drop," etc., but this work does not seem to have been expanded. I hope that the current cultural and singing circles will jointly undertake this work; of course, the scope is not limited to popular songs, but because it is easy to start and effective. As for non-popular songs, all those that are useless and toxic must also be revised in the same way!</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will use the current environment to answer my proposal, then it is also possible to adapt it into something that is quite useful and not very conflicting. In short, we should use songs as an educational tool, and absolutely not allow it to be used to anesthetize people. As for the production of new songs, we should pay close attention and be responsible for opening a bright and broad path, so that靡靡之音 will disappear from the isolated island, and it will be of great benefit to young people, children, society, and the country.

<h3>Nanhua Silver Group Movie Queen Li Qinian Accepted a Job from Yi Hua</h3>
<p>— A Traveling Reporter</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, Li Qinian is a movie queen who has been popular in the South China film industry for many years. She really knows how to act, so she is known as the "Rare Treasure of the Southern Film Industry." Not long ago, Yi Hua's young owner Yan Youxiang mentioned inviting Qinian to join Yi Hua while conveniently inviting Li Li from Peiping. However, in order to endure the severe cold and speed up learning Mandarin, she decided to come to Shanghai in the bright spring of March. This time, Yan Youxiang went to Hong Kong again, and Qinian has officially signed the contract, deciding to advance the schedule, and let him return to Shanghai first to arrange the residence, select scripts, and prepare to use all her strength to establish a new and glorious page for the Shanghai film industry in 1940.</p>
<p>She is currently rushing to shoot a film "Tiger Roars in Pipa Lane" with Ma Shizeng, the most famous in Hong Kong. This film is set against the background of the Anti-Japanese War and uses love as an insertion. This film will win the praise of millions of movie fans and the media!</p>
<h3>Beijing Opera and Drama (6)</h3>
<p>Many people say that "Beijing Opera" is meaningless and does not conform to the trend. There are also many people who say that "Drama" is tasteless, neither singing nor dancing. Rather than watching a drama, it is better to go to the road to see the men, women, old, and young coming and going. When these two types of people talk to me, I always tell them to watch it a few more times before speaking. In my opinion, both Beijing Opera and Drama, the good ones are good, and the bad ones are also okay. Simply put, each has its own advantages. Before we study a certain art, it is best not to criticize it easily. Even if we criticize it, we can only say that it is a personal opinion, and we must never make a definitive statement. Because the establishment of an art always has its uniqueness, and the playwright always has a lot of painstaking efforts. No matter whether its taste is low-level or high-level, it can always gain the appreciation and sympathy of a part of society. Otherwise, even if no one criticizes or points out its flaws, it will eventually be naturally eliminated.</p>
<p>In my personal opinion, the style of Beijing Opera is freehand, while the drama is realistic. Beijing Opera is like painting, while the drama is like photography. But no matter how freehand the painter is, he can't paint a person with only one eye and two mouths growing backwards. No matter how realistic the photographer is, he won't take a toilet and a chamber pot as his photographic objects. This means that since it is called an art, it must consider the conditions of beauty even for the real. Conversely, beauty that does not conform to the facts and principles cannot exist.</p>
<p>There are two points that both Beijing Opera and Drama need to study hard. The first point is the dialogue, which must be clear and fluent. Because it must be clear, you have to study the initial and final consonants, the four tones, and the phonetic spellings. Because it must be fluent, you must be proficient, have intonation, divide into upper and lower sentences, and have rhythm. The most taboo in Beijing Opera's dialogue is a smooth side, or a single soup, and female actors often make the mistake of filling their mouths with尖characters. When insiders hear it, they can't help but feel terrified. Even outsiders, although they dare not make any criticisms, always feel that it is unpleasant to the ear, or even incomprehensible. To put it jokingly, this is not like playing the lute to a cow, it is simply like playing cotton to a person. Even if you meet Zhong Ziqi, you can't fathom the ambition of high mountains and flowing water. Or perhaps you think that the dialogue in a drama doesn't have these poor requirements. I think otherwise. Since the drama does not emphasize singing, isn't the dialogue more important? Moreover, the drama focuses on realism. If you don't let people hear what's going on, then it's really tasteless. The problems I often hear are that one is Mandarin that is half southern and half northern, and the other is a tone like a Westerner saying Jesus. However, a few people who often play the main roles, especially the female lead, do not have this problem, but supporting roles are not unimportant. Writing this, I suddenly remembered an old incident ten years ago. A middle school teacher came to me to discuss something. I asked him what subject he was teaching at your school. He said he was teaching鬼語. At the time, I didn't think about it and asked in surprise how ghosts could speak. I didn't want him to be embarrassed, and I only realized at this point that the teacher had mispronounced the character國. This can also prove the importance of the pronunciation of words in dialogue.</p>
<p>The second point is expression. First, you can't ignore the identity of the character in the play. Second, you must show the emotions of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness at the time. The most difficult to express are hidden worries, feigned joy, slight anger, false jealousy, pretending to be crazy, etc. You must never forget the previous character and only express the next one. Third, don't neglect the study of the relationship between the characters' eras throughout the play. For example, when performing the full-length play of Leifeng Pagoda, Shi Lin at the time of the broken bridge and childbirth has just been born, and Shi Lin at the time of the champion's sacrifice to the pagoda has grown into a person in his twenties. Bai Niangniang is a fairy, so we won't bother with her, but have Xu Xian Guan's sister and brother-in-law also obtained the fairy's art of staying young? Other plays such as Teaching the Son, Double Official Edict, Qiankun Fushou Mirror, etc., are too numerous to mention. This is something that drama pays a lot of attention to.</p>

<h3>Pinocchio's Adventures</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ivan</p>
<p>Falling for Tricks Again</p>
<p>On the way home, Pinocchio comes across a small inn called the Red Lobster Restaurant. It's where the thief brothers divide their loot and hatch their schemes. The cat Gideon and the fox John are there too, counting their coins. At the inn, they meet a coachman who specializes in buying naughty boys. Another fortune! they think. So they offer to go outside the restaurant to find him some.</p>
<p>The unfortunate puppet is running into them at that very moment. He'd made a bet with Jiminy Cricket about who could get home first, leaving the tiny cricket far behind. The two rogues spot him at once. They stop Pinocchio and pretend to ask him all sorts of questions.</p>
<p>They tell Pinocchio that he looks unwell and needs to go to Pleasure Island for a cure. They describe the island in glowing terms. The poor little puppet can't resist the lure of the ice cream mountains and fudge trees, and finally puts the thought of school out of his mind. He's been tricked again. Jiminy Cricket, meanwhile, has run all the way to the old carpenter's house, only to find that Pinocchio is missing. What to do? Go back and look for him. (5)</p>

<h3>First Love</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Because of Diana Durbin's growth, New Universal Company produced this "First Love" following "Adolescence." The grown-up Diana Durbin is still very innocent and lively, and in the singing in the first and last sections of this film, she shows that she is not only a comedic actor, but also a tragic one.</p>
<p>The style of "First Love" is similar to "Three Flowers." The playwright has created several characters with different personalities: James, the wealthy uncle; the aunt who believes in astrology; Walter, the lazy and clumsy cousin; Babe Lan, the dissolute cousin; and George, the loyal and humorous servant. These characters form a comedy.</p>
<p>The director also has delicate descriptions of the personalities of these characters; however, because of the simplicity of the story, the comedic atmosphere is not as strong as "Three Flowers."</p>
<p>Diana Durbin sang four songs before and after. At the beginning, she sang "Sweet Home" because she had nowhere to go after graduation. Her sadness and the lovers who finally get married at the end echo each other and are very lovely. The other two songs also have humorous descriptions.</p>
<p>Robert Stack, who is hailed as the "Star of Luck," may be on the silver screen for the first time, but he is not outstanding and has very few scenes.</p>
