<h3 id="c16">社會不安之因素 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>社會不安定，則必趨衰頹。而今日之上海社會，形之於外者則如綁刦暗殺案件之日出不已；蘊之於內者則爲社會基幹之薪工階級，惶惶不髯於生活之如何維持。飢寒交迫，無可爲計。鋌而走險者，或相率思蠢動。夫若是，社會之整個基礎搖動矣。整個社會果至於搖動之地步，固非富有者之福，亦豈爲有治安之責者，所易收拾於將來；若至事後補苴，又何如消弭禍患於未作之前爲愈也。</p>
<p>消弭上海今日社會不安定之因素，似非易言，但扼要言之，袪其泰甚，補其不足，撒除其故障而已。</p>
<p>所謂袪其泰甚也者，賭風淫風，俱足以滋長盜風。故自宵禁加嚴，冶遊知戒；而一切不正當之娛樂事業，無形中富不無打擊。然此恐爲一時之現象也，蓋宵禁之應從嚴，宜無間於貧富，亦應不自今始；然而戒嚴之後，蹁躚舞女，出入自如；便便腹賈，往來無礙，今雖從嚴執行，能保其有持久性否；藉曰不然，一曝十寒，於事何濟。要知上海社會所以多罪惡，正爲不正當娛樂事業誘惑太强，刺激太烈，人孰無欲，而能克己者少，遂有不勝一時之衝動，自陷於綱羅，同歸墮落，無從湔祓也已。當然，羣居不能無娛樂，然都市之容許娛樂事業，不可偏重於公收益爲目的，置善良風紀社會治安於緩圖。目不見所欲，其心不亂；意有所不平，敢於逞暴，社會享樂，過分懸殊，强者攘臂，弱者扼腕，社會不安所由起也，袪其太甚，不平稍平，是在管理之中從嚴執行而已。</p>
<p>所謂補其不足也者，蓋自投機風行，物價飛漲，富者增富，貧者益貧；月有所入，　然若有不足焉已；昔日能如此，可以度其安閒之生活，今日猶如此，不足以養家活口。非不足也，不能抵銷物價所漲之鉅也。夫此不足之數，即生活所以感覺不安，而如何可使之安，固在於物價平準，然在物價未平準前，以彌補其所不足者，惟望在於社會上層，對於下級生活津貼之加給；但加給生活津貼，間接亦可以提高物價。何况津貼之有無，不能一概論，營業有大小，盈虧復不一，故有多有少，有有有無，未可以解決一般生活之安定也。再則惟有用集團之力量，採辦日用所必需之品，以應團員之消費，此其理論固正大，而事實上萬難辦到，有之，亦極少數而已。况所謂集團購買也者，往往不能如其理想之圓滿，於是最直接簡捷之辦法，仍莫如物價之平準是已。</p>
<p>上海物價之高貴，非由於供求之不相稱，而由於人爲操縱之力量太大，操縱之方式有二，運用其資力，一也；利用其勢力，二也。用資力相操縱，其勢雖盛，然至其有利之時則脫，不脫固有之，但爲少數。或至其資力不足時，亦不能久相持；或劻絕其周轉之路，雖欲操縱，有不可得已。但如利用其勢力以相操縱，害有不可勝言。蓋可强歛農商所出產，歸其獨營，於是物價不隨市漲跌而恣意居奇矣。悉收四方之所有，惟經營者獨得利用，此外則莫得而問津，於是官營托拉司之局面以成，而日用所資失其調節矣。即不歸其獨營，而限制其輸出，束縛其轉運，或「寓禁於征」橫征暴歛，婪索無饜，於是物產歉固貴，物產豐亦貴，民生尙有寬裕之日哉？多少罪害，假統制之名而肆，夫是豈統制之本意哉？民生不寗，社會不安，蓋有由來矣。</p>

<p>上海米糧評價委員會爲協商穩定米市具體辦法起見、復於昨日下午四時、在愛多亞路十五號會所召開第四次常務委員會議、計到法租界評價委員會代表謝雪芳、上海市商會鍾謹忱、暨該會全體委員、議決結果、函請兩租界當局暨市商會勸導各業、一致集團購米、以期增厚存糧、穩定米價、至於各種洋米評價、重行變訂（見通吿），並定於今日起公吿市塲實行、至六時許始吿散會、</p>
<p>評定價格</p>
<p>該會昨日商討結果、決按照產價情形酌予增加、並於今晨公吿市塲云、「查近來洋米產價步漲、超過本埠現售市價、相差漸巨、國內早稻雖已見新、來源依然受阻、長此以往、存糧勢難增多、爰經本委咒會召集常會鄭重討論、酌量現實情形、重行評定各種洋米最高市價、開列如左（八月三十一日起）一號西貢暹羅六十一元五角、火絞六十一元、二號西貢暹羅五十九元、小絞五十九元、高東京臼米五十六元、東京糙米五十二元、米菉五十元、混合碎米四十六元、上列價格、務須切實遵守、市塲買賣、祗准在該項價格之下、不得超越逾限、如有暗盤等情事、一經察覺、卽當陳報兩租界當局嚴厲懲處之、特此通吿」、</p>
<p>囤戶猖獗</p>
<p>近來一般投機米蠢莫不掀風作浪、囤藏大宗食米、乘機抬價出籠、企圖不勞而獲巨利、乃至整個米市動盪不定、此次竟藉口滬越間航運中斷、西貢洋米來源斷絕、認爲時機復臨、乃繼續作崇、一時滿城風雨、人心忐忑、市况至爲紊亂、彼此互抬、「搶帽子」之風復熾、洋米在塲買賣、竟超越限價、而市塲暗盤亦隨之叢生、惟此輩投機奸徒、竟將當局訓論、置若罔聞、橫行不法、誠罪大惡極、今全市四百萬市民莫不渴盼兩租界當局嚴厲查究、照旣頒規則按章懲處，藉以取締非法交易、穩定整個民食、</p>
<p>存米充斥新聲社記者昨分別向米業界探悉、關於本市米機存底、目前極度充實、整個民食決無匱乏之虞、茲據上海米糧評價委員會報吿、該會本週調查（自上星期四起至本星期四止）各米棧存底共計七十四萬五千九百零八包、其中（一）浦東之老太古·隆茂·其昌·公司棧爲機多、（二）虹口之公和祥棧次之、（三）中區之中國銀行·茂泰棧·等第三、兩租界米店及住戶儲藏者不在內、惟大宗米糧則爲囤戶所有、流通市上者僅及一半、況過去數日中、仍由國外源源運抵、每日到銷足够平衡、而日內市塲買賣各貨、顯與各地產價無關、蓋市塲米價騰漲、顯係被投機操縱者把持現貨故也、聞昨日較好洋米、已難購到、足見投機囤積者之居心叵測、</p>

<p>自英國禁止英倫鈔票輸入後、在華之英商銀行以及財政部之中國銀行、收兌英倫鈔票業已如期截止、上海錢兌業市場鑒於英倫鈔票、並非絕對禁止行便、僅不得輸入英國而已、况由華旅行英國者、得隨時携帶十鎊進口、所以對小額英金票仍予收進、公會因有實際交易、故暫予掛牌、例如昨日爲五十三元五角、此後是否繼續掛牌決視有無交易而定、</p>
<p>收兌部額決不宣布</p>
<p>中國銀行上海分行奉令收兌英倫鈔票業已如期截止、昨晨起已不再收受、對收得之英鈔、已彙總運英、並已於前日午夜十二時以前由郵局寄英、同時電英倫敦中國銀行分行知照、此次該行收兌之英鈔總額、依照業務上之向例、對外則決不宣佈、聞中國銀行倫敦分行、已照禁英鈔輸英後之轉滙補救辦法、向英國財政部報吿備查、</p>
<p>小額英鈔仍予收受</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向匯豐麥加利等行探悉、英商銀行收兌英鈔截止後、已將收得之英鈔總額電倫敦總行報吿、再分批將英鈔由郵運英、聞今收兌期雖已截止、對往來戶之小額英金票、仍另酌量收兌、故英金票此後在華、仍有折合法幣之行市、蓋英金票係爲英國之幣制、在國內外仍得行使、惟不得自由輸入英國耳、</p>
<p>英鈔付郵自負責任</p>
<p>上海郵政管理局對於英國禁止英倫鈔票輸入、因迄未奉交通部昆明郵政總局之命令、所以此後由郵寄英之英鈔票、仍予照常收寄、暫不禁止、惟中途如有任何障碍、由寄件人自負責任、如到達目的地後、遭富局拒絕進口者、則由郵局將原件退回寄件人、惟今英國已頒佈禁止英鈔輸入之命令、望在華持英鈔付郵寄英者、應特別注意、以免蒙受意外損失、</p>

<h3 id="c102">怎樣識別假鈔票？ <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 子</p>
<p>怎樣鑒別假鈔票，這是每個「櫃台朋友一所急欲知的常識。</p>
<p>其實不通用的鈔票，並不僅限於「假」，其他如改票夾條等僞鈔，亦屬禁止通用之列，現在大略將其種類及鑒別方法分述於下：</p>
<p>假鈔票這動鈔票市上發現最多，印刷有好有差，印刷差的鈔票，自然容易辨別，印刷好的鈔票，却簡直可以亂眞，使人鑒別爲難，不過如若細心察閱，終究可看出破綻來，因爲無論假鈔票的印刷怎樣優良，如和眞鈔比較，花紋必較粗，同時，眞鈔大多有水印，假鈔則無，故鑒別僞造鈔票，「細心察閱」是不二法鬥。</p>
<p>改票　改票乃是將眞鈔原底，加以更改，例如一元鈔票，被改成五元，五元鈔票，將數目改成十元，鑒別之法，必須記熟各銀行所發鈔票之色樣，一旦遇見這種改票時，由色樣上就可分別出來。譬如廿五年中央銀行所發行之五元鈔，四邊花紋是綠色的，數目字上之圖案，略呈方形，而同年該行所發行之十元票，四周花紋却是綠深顏色，數目字上之圖案，略呈橢圓形，如此記熟後，則看到該行此種鈔票之五元改十元僞鈔時，就會由圖案上辨別出其僞·自然，鈔票上數目字被更改之處，無論更改手段怎樣高妙，總有些更改後無法彌補之踪跡，不過，這如在不常看鈔票的人，是很難看出的。</p>
<p>夾條　一張鈔票，使用日久，傳遞收授，難免破損，於是在不障礙顯著圖色範圍之內，加以貼補，仍可通用，亦屬人情之常的事。但我們絕不可認作人情之常而就忽略，因爲這種鈔票，正有不少夾條僞鈔參雜其中，大意收下來，就將成廢紙。這種鈔票是將眞鈔上抽下一條，再將偽鈔補上去，如此抽下的眞鈔又可併成整鈔混用，所以鑒別這種偽鈔，祇須就貼補部份細心察看，就不難看出破綻。</p>
<p>除去上述以外，尙有，不通用鈔票多種，如限於一省行使的鈔票，他處卽不可通用，這種鈔票，票面上印明通行之地，不難一望而知。又有鈔票上號碼不全或兩邊不同號碼的鈔票，亦不通用。</p>
<p>最後得附帶說，僞鈔並不限於元票，角票之中亦有很多偽鈔，而最近中央所發行的五分分幣券，市上已有僞者出現，我們不可以其額小而不加注意。</p>
<p>編者按：如何鑒別鈔票眞僞，確是人人所欲得知之一事，編者雖非工商界中人，而生平鈔票過手亦不多，然求知之心，正不亞於讀者，平常就觀察所得，大概眞鈔票紙張花紋印刷皆精。用手指相摸，紙張光潔勻細，花紋凹凸歷歷可辨。用目力觀察，色澤光鮮，雖陳舊而花紋淸楚精細，大都爲眞鈔。有謂有不少鈔票在未有水印前，附有暗號，但不肯示人，誠恐公開之後，作僞者亦可仿造，失其效用，故只可由本行或其有關係之銀錢業知之，至於鈔票使用人之利害有所不顧。亦有謂造僞鈔者，並不欲求其逼眞，常故露破綻，將來設有破獲之日，以爲用者自不小心，輕减其罪刑，然乎吾乎，還當質之銀錢業中人。</p>

<p>洋米昨市更形鋒俏、雖評價委員會照最高限價嚴厲執行限制、並公吿云、「値茲棧存豐足、凡吾同業務須遵照評價交易、如有故違、經檢舉、報吿兩工部局從嚴懲處」云云、故市上公開價格悉照日前評開高價、但高貨殊少出樣、中次抵冲、市價已暗砌一元至一元半矣、原包回籠英華司允見交易活潑、蓋貨主以奇貨可居、而囤客則盡力吸收、且無限制之評價、因此二號邊邏初開六十六元三角、繼爲六十七元、六十八元七角、最高六十九元半、乃比前日漲二元半、二號西貢初開六十八元、已大一元、旋喊六十九元半及七十元零五角、雖未妥交、而後形則已見悄西貢碎開五十三元八角至五十四元八角、小絞初開六十七元尙少受主、繼至六十七元六角又無售出、暹米茶開五十八元半、均　前價大二三五元不一、統市原已有七百多噸、現一萬三千包交易、</p>

<p>周浦新粳昨到三十五擔、而銷塲方面以斷貨數朝、應需頓淮、在一般作客相互競購下、一霎卽罄、所以市面堅悄異常、開六十四元七角、六十四元半、計升一二元之巨、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨市日粉、近疲遠俏、因現貨邇來實銷不起、內地粉及洋粉充斥於市、人心難看好、遠期情勢、則被金高滙縮所激起、囤戶問津者頗不乏人、故九月份鳳凰牌卽由十四元七角半升至八角半、十月份由十四元九角升至十五元〇三分、成交七千五百包、現貨仍爲十四元五角、僅本客零星點綴而已、至華粉廠盤、久無變動、福阜兩廠批出的有三四千包、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日小麥交易、依然淸寂、蓋以邇日內地到貨不多、洋麥已到兩船、尙有三船、須下月初旬可到、而國外定價、巳難通劃、故人心漸吿堅穩、行販意圖扳高、惟日廠吃盤奇苛、華廠解運困難、需要難於開展、僅三鑫廠每日收進二三千包云、</p>

<p>紗市開盤上漲、旋卽回落、局勢仍在高檔徘徊、頗有拉鋸式之勢、市場一般投機者之議論、謂黃金昂騰、匯票趨縮、紗市應當看升、漲出千元關門、不足爲奇　　以長在九百七八十元間盤旋不前、又有一說則謂存紗日增、紗銷出路殊爲狄隘、所以投機商雖竭力抬高、然籌碼依然充斥也、</p>

<p>現棉情形、依然澹泊、此因上月外棉進口數字殊巨、各廠納胃殊滯、所以情况無大向　之力、不過近來新　　　良佳、據四鄕莊客云、本年之棉質、皮份較上年爲佳、故日　對於新棉已開始活動採辦、但華廠需要未見發展、實因　棉充足之故也、</p>

<p>三代之世，禮樂盛明，夏商各有制作，至周大備，故禮樂等書，亦惟周歷年最久，聖人最多，述作相傳，重訓後世；而二代禮榮，乃由朝廟之沿革，儒生之考證，裒集成文，其標明夏商之禮以外，皆爲周制，亦云繁矣！秦楚二炬之後，蕩然無存，文武景宣之世，乃漸復出，然經後儒竄易，淺人掇摭，已非周時遣書。終漢之世，儒生聚訟，以爲學之所在，而朝野上下，鮮有能行之者，自是遂不複言古禮。明尙八股，至於庠序之士，科目之官，並禮經句讀之不知，此風沿及本朝，雖經　輩出，而八股之士，襲明夙尙，更有甚焉，以至見四人作樂作舞，皆以爲異域之聲，而不屑過視，嗚呼！豈知古音古節之所存者，今得見之西樂，而猶與三代聲容，相爲表裏也。中國之樂舞，行於三代，盛於周，至春秋而止，蓋封建廢而井田不行，井田不行而飲射之禮不習於鄉，由是民不知樂，安見樂舞，推其所由，自秦已然，此氣運使之，非盡關於人事也。</p>

<p>— 杭客</p>
<p>在　篇文章裏描寫然高　基。據說高爾基在死的那天，莫斯科遍街掛滿紅底黑邊喪旂，各家書店都列出高爾基　著作書像及銅像；戲院停演；公園閉門；無綫電播送着蕭邦的葬禮進行曲；第天的報紙十塞滿追悼的哀文；送喪者萬人空巷，史太林，莫洛托夫諸要人立在高氏遺體傍任榮譽守衛人……以一個要蕭桿兒者在死後榮耀如此，至是可羨。但是我們不要忘記，高氏並不是以一個文人的身份得着這樣榮譽的，高氏在史太林及蘇俄全民衆的目光中，他簡直同列寗一般是一個社會主義國家的奠立者。</p>
<p>有人看見中國文學家都是寂寞的死去，又看見俄國政府如此的寵愛高爾基，因而憤激的說：「中國文人無出路，根本政府就輕視文學家的力量！」其實並非政府輕視文學家，而是文學家自身拿不出適合時代同民衆需要的產品。漢的辭賦家，魏晋六朝的小品文作者，唐代的詩人，小說家，散文家，宋的詞客，元的曲家，在帝王及貴族的面前是奴隸，在民衆的面前是路人；簡言之，都是以文章作玩品而已！民國以後，鬧了多年的革金文學，作家與民衆仍是路人。可見輕視文學家是民衆而非政附，而日也要民衆的寵愛，才是文人所可以寳貴的。杜斯脫以夫期基並不見重於舊俄當軸，但死後仍有幾十萬勞苦民衆的自動送喪，完成了一次隆重不亞於高氏的葬禮。</p>
<p>偉大的時代在中國是到了！中日抗戰同十月革命的時代一樣可以造就不少的高爾基，中國作家想在死後受到高氏的榮譽，要靠自己在抗戰中把自身弄成高爾基才行。吾則民衆對你還是淡漠的。</p>

<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>我們爲什麼而勞動呢？金錢麼？</p>
<p>你縣着了幾千萬金錢；但一定的，你的金錢終不能保留長久，最後還是不免要被消蝕個精光。</p>
<p>那麼，爲權勢而勞動麼？</p>
<p>全世界第一個偉大的帝王的名字，早已被人忘却。而其他具有被我們傾慕的權勢者，亦都已付諸流水。幾曾有大力的人能够站在尼加拉瀑布之旁而不心驚胆寒？幾會有人的權勢力量曾可以與風浪的威力相比擬？人類的權勢所賜予自己的一無他物，除去愚拙的暫時使個人慾望滿足而已！</p>
<p>然而，什麼最有價値呢？讓我們看一看已來與已往値得人們景仰的偉人，隨便舉幾個例：哥崙布，米開蘭基羅，感勃福斯，莎士比亞，伽利略，福爾敦，瓦特，哈格利佛斯—</p>
<p>他們每個人都有値得提起的歷史，他們都是爲人家的利益而辛勤工作。</p>
<p>哈格利佛斯，他是一個服裝家，他發明紡織機，使千萬個人都有舒服的衣服穿着。伽利略，他改良望遠鏡，使人們得以測窺太空的宏偉。威勃福斯，協助人們恢復良知，他解放幾百萬奴隸。哥侖布給予一個大民族良好的家園。米開蘭基羅與莎士比亞激動人們的才能致力於新事業，飼餵人們精神的飢渴—眞是比塡充腸胃更重要的工作！我們坐着福爾教發明的汽船，幷瓦特發明的引擎推動我們前進。</p>
<p>最偉大的人常爲後入的福利而努力；耶蘇所竭力規勸世人的也不過是互相愛護。</p>
<p>金錢有了，樣勢有了，但你如果想稍稍高出於千萬個自生自死的人們，試問你有金錢與權勢，但有何用？</p>
<p>倘你是百萬個旣無財又無勢的人中之一，你可以做的事正也不少：你可以爲老人負担重物，你可以鼓勵一個可憐的的惡徒悔過自新，你可以做一個好榜樣給孩子，你可以規勸工作者誠實爲謀取自身幸福而工作。</p>
<p>殺戮十個大人較重要於飼養一千個孩子的時代，早已過去，現在我們是要幫助人們好好利用共百萬家財以濟世。</p>
<p>你應當現在立刻盡最大能力爲大衆幸福而努力，寗可以做一個因係先鋒而致出軌的人</p>

<p>— 止軒</p>
<p>許多人，用着誇耀和羨慕的口氣，述說着一件件的故事。某人做了近二三十年的生意，到這二年來，才多了二三萬。有某人，今年不滿二十歲，現在恐怕有千把一月的進賬。</p>
<p>又有某人，乘今年風頭上，也賺了萬把。</p>
<p>記不淸那許多不同的人和彷事的。在我聽來覺得都是相我驚異那許多的話，都是離不了一個同樣的目標。我要感謝那許多鼓勵黽勉的諄諄說話的心。但，我卻感到如身在沙漠上，無限的寂寞。</p>

<p>第六章　危險的經歷</p>
<p>這時候辦公室的門上忽悠有咯咯的聲音，接着不等倪金壽的回音，那門已推開了，走進一個穿一身藏靑西裝，戴黑呢軟胎帽的人來。那人臉上戴着一副闊邊墨晶眼鏡，上嘴脣留着黑色的短鬚，他進了門便直立着，連帽子都沒除去。</p>
<p>倪金壽立起身來，兩手撑着書桌，向那來客問道：「那一位？有什麼事？」</p>
<p>那人仍僵立着不答。我覺得有些突兀，這是公務員的辦公處，這個人怎麼能隨便闖進來。我的視綫一集中，便不禁驚呼起來</p>
<p>「霍桑！」</p>
<p>他果眞是霍桑，不過我細　他左右面頰上，却不見有什麼傷痕。倪金壽倒呆了一呆。霍桑一壁除去他的黑帽，黑眼鏡，一壁好像懊惱地說話。</p>
<p>「唉，我太膽小了！一價人上了年紀、做事往往會比少年謹愼。可是有時候我壞在太謹愼上！」</p>
<p>倪金壽笑着說：「霍先生，這話什麼意思？我摸不着頭腦——你的化　術眞不錯。」</p>
<p>霍桑又將嘴脣一黏着的假鬚輕輕揭了下來。「不錯？可是給包朗瞧破了。這也算不得化裝，祇是一種臨時的急救罷了。」</p>
<p>那余甘棠忽又從椅子上挺直了身子。他的眼光在霍桑和我二人的臉上往來打轉。霍桑也注意到這少年。</p>
<p>他用手指着那少年向倪金壽發問「這一位是誰？」他的語調中帶着輕率，分明他故意裝做不認識而問的。</p>
<p>倪金壽答道：「余甘棠——江南大學的高材生。」</p>
<p>霍桑旋轉頭去，莊重地向那少年鞠了一個躬。「唉，失敬了！余先生，你是個時代育年，智識份子，未來社會的導領者，我眞是失敬！」他恭敬地鞠了個躬，頓了一頓，接續說：「很可惜的，你到了這裏，也許要躭誤你的功課。」</p>

<p>人生不知有多少事，爲將來所誤。</p>
<p>一般人，做什麼事，萬一失敗，非但不再接再厲，反而云：「羽毛未豐，將來再說。」共實，到什麼時候羽毛才算豐？人生有幾個將來？</p>
<p>語云「追悼過去，無濟於事。僮憬未來，渺小難靠。」故人生最寳貴的莫如抓住現在。</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>「一葉落而天下秋」，金風送凉，暑氣全消，正是讀書最適宜的時候。但是書價高漲，贖書欲購無力，只好「望書興歎」，辜負這大好環境，眞所謂「秋天不是讀書天」了呢！</p>
<p>話得說回來，化少許金錢買有價値書本的地方，並非沒有，啓明書局卽其一例，所出「世界文學名著」，都二百餘種，本本名着，譯筆流暢，售價低廉，如「茵夢湖一一書，只售一角六分，屠格湼夫之「初戀」，亦只售二角餘，不愧被舉爲大衆之唯一精神食糧。</p>
<p>又出有英文自修叢書，完全依據自修需要而編輯，由淺入深，値得瀏覽。如文法，讀本，會話，習字，書信，辭典，字典等俱全。</p>

<p>— 郁啸</p>
<p>「小城故事」是袁駿編的，從這駿字上着想，也許可以知道這編者是誰；總之，也許也是留美戲劇專家，與導演佐臨（也就是本刊前些天所載的黃作霖）一樣。編者頗自負不凡，這喜劇的確也寫得好，尤其是最後的第五慕。情節呢，讓我賣一個關子，諸位一看就知道。我這兒只介紹他所刻畫的幾個人物；</p>
<p>郎四太太　慕容婉兒演。戴了一副環子，說話的時候，不住的搖頭，漂亮極了。這做工不容易，猶如平劇中的老褚彪擺鬍子。編者或導演弄一點Oharacter，可苦了婉兒，我擔心她幾天演下來，會要頸子酸的，</p>
<p>郎四老爺　韓非演。前額禿了一大片，小禿子忽然做了老禿子。穿一件古　　心。最妙的連牙齒也化裝得脫落了幾顆似的。說起話來，下巴一伸一伸的；走起路來，一搖一擺的，煞是好看，怕老婆專家唯命是從。</p>
<p>老徐　魏征演。專愛偷看，每每在偷看的時候，面靠着門，人家把門一推，他的臉上就是一塊靑。據說他自己結婚，本性難移，竟也到窗外去偷看新房，忘了這新房是他自己的。</p>
<p>大薛　含　演。吝嗇鬼，白吃專家，到楊家來住了好多天，從來不曾賞給僕人一個小錢。爲了幾個銅元，會和黃包車夫打架。據說他小的時候吃花生米，一粒掉在地下，恐怕別人搶他的，就用脚踏碎。</p>
<p>其他如賣假古董的揚繩祖，吳冰演，三塊錢的破香爐會討價十八塊；他的妻子柳葉子，夏霞演，是個浪漫的交際花，一心只想到上海去；十足舊派的貝二太太，戴紜演，走路一扭一扭的；她的丈夫貝二老爺，莫言演，一肚皮的壞主意；極度近　的錢八爺，嚴俊演，老而好色；以及王祺的王媽，芷君的小薜，天然的鼓上風，沒有一個不是典型的人物。</p>
<h3 id="c117">好萊塢影星的私人秘書 <a href="#c117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— 莎薇</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在好萊塢較有地位的電影演員，他或她差不多都騁有私人秘害，后面所記的，就是大明星中的幾個秘書則影。</p>
<p>第一個要提到的那是埃蘭克拉克（Ｉola　ＯlarK）那是在三個月之前愛德華羅寳遜的友人，聽羅賓遜說要用一個女書記來助理他的信札，這位朋友就想到克小姐正在想找工作做，他就把她介紹了給他。二十四歲的埃蘭，她出身於高等學校，並還在大學裏進過商科，後來又曾服務於鉛業公司及保險公司。現在她已漸漸地成爲一個老練的明星秘書了，她同時還是羅賓遜家裏的一個精幹的管家婦，他和羅賓遜夫人很合得來，常常幫着她處理一切的家務，或者照顧他們的小孩。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>佐伊麥克利也有一個私人秘書，那位女士本是佐伊替身卡爾Ｏarl）的妻子，名字叫克利拉安狄勒（Ｏlaire　Andre），她已和佐伊相處有三年之久，在這三年內每個星期中有五天半是伏在派拉蒙攝影塲中的一個特設的小寫字間裏爲佐伊工作着，平時她叫他爲佐伊，佐伊也直呼她的名字，所以兩人已如朋友那樣的親熱了</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>華爾脫辟克（Ｗaltel　ＰicK）是一個很英俊的少年，也就是茂文陶格拉斯的左右手，數年前曾畢業於華盛頓大舉，後來在紐約碰着他的表姊陶格拉斯夫人，就跟着他們到好萊塢去，做了茂文陶格拉期的害記。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>當銀幕上的風流小生泰羅尼鮑華兒，還在紐約舞台上和女戲劇家凱司琳康納兒合作時，他認識了一個叫皮兒格勒格（Ｂill　Ｇallagher）的少年。後來泰在好萊塢想起了他，就寫信去把皮爾請了來。泰在決定無論什麼事情之前，總喜歡先和皮爾商量，因爲泰觉得皮爾實在是個很可信託而且腦力過人的人。</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>配奇姑（Peggy　Ｇough）小姐雖在史本塞屈萊賽處服務了好多年，但他們見了面，還是非常客氣。她現在是二十七　，看上去好像還只有一十一歲的模樣。配奇本是加利福尼亞大學的學生，自從做了史本塞的秘害後，天天巷他答覆那些業務上的，或者影迷們的信件。她說，雖則她的辦公處是在神秘女郞嘉寳的化裝室（在米高梅攝影　中）的隔壁，可是她却一次也沒有見過嘉寳，這大概就是嘉寳之所以謂神秘吧！</p>

<h3 id="e16">Factors of Social Unrest <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Social instability inevitably leads to decline. The Shanghai society of today outwardly manifests itself in the incessant rise of cases of kidnapping and assassination; inwardly, it is the wage-earning class, the foundation of society, who are anxiously concerned about how to maintain their livelihoods. Beset by hunger and cold, with no way out, some may resort to desperate measures or contemplate unrest. If this is the case, the entire foundation of society is shaken. If the entire society reaches a state of turmoil, it is certainly not a blessing for the wealthy, nor is it something that those responsible for maintaining order can easily manage in the future. It is far better to eliminate the causes of trouble before they arise than to try to repair the damage after it has been done.</p>
<p>Eliminating the factors of social unrest in Shanghai today is not easy, but to put it succinctly, it is a matter of curbing the excessive, supplementing the insufficient, and removing the obstacles.</p>
<p>By "curbing the excessive" is meant that gambling and lewdness are both sufficient to breed thievery. Therefore, since the curfew has been tightened, licentious activities have been curtailed, and all illegitimate entertainment businesses have been dealt a blow. However, this may only be a temporary phenomenon. The strict enforcement of the curfew should apply equally to the rich and the poor, and should not begin only now. However, after the imposition of martial law, dancing girls can come and go as they please, and wealthy merchants can travel without hindrance. Even if it is strictly enforced now, can it be guaranteed to be sustainable? If not, a flash in the pan will be of no use. It is important to understand that the reason why Shanghai society has so much crime is that illegitimate entertainment businesses are too tempting and too stimulating. Who is without desires, but few can restrain themselves, and thus many succumb to momentary impulses, trap themselves in the net, fall into depravity, and have no way to cleanse themselves. Of course, there can be no lack of entertainment in a community, but the permission of entertainment businesses in a city should not be overly focused on public revenue as the goal, while putting good morals and social order on the back burner. If the eyes do not see what they desire, the heart will not be disturbed. If there is a sense of injustice, there is a willingness to resort to violence. Social enjoyment is excessively disparate. The strong flex their muscles, the weak gnash their teeth, and social unrest arises. Curbing the excessive and leveling out the inequality a little requires strict enforcement by the authorities.</p>
<p>By "supplementing the insufficient" is meant that since speculation has become rampant and prices have soared, the rich have become richer and the poor have become poorer. Even with a monthly income, it still seems insufficient. In the past, this amount was enough to live a comfortable life; today, it is not enough to support a family. It is not that the income is insufficient, but that it cannot offset the huge increase in prices. This insufficient amount is the reason why people feel insecure about their lives. How can this insecurity be alleviated? Of course, prices must be stabilized. But before prices are stabilized, the only way to make up for the shortfall is to hope that the upper echelons of society will provide additional living subsidies to those in the lower ranks. However, increasing living subsidies may indirectly raise prices. Moreover, the availability of subsidies cannot be generalized. Businesses vary in size, and profits and losses differ, so there will be more or less, or none at all. This cannot solve the general problem of livelihood security. Another option is to use the power of groups to purchase daily necessities to meet the consumption needs of group members. The theory behind this is certainly sound, but in reality, it is extremely difficult to achieve, and even when it does happen, it involves only a very small number of people. Moreover, the so-called group purchases often fail to live up to their ideals. Therefore, the most direct and simple solution is still to stabilize prices.</p>
<p>The high cost of goods in Shanghai is not due to an imbalance between supply and demand, but to the excessive power of artificial manipulation. There are two ways to manipulate prices: one is to use financial resources, and the other is to use influence. Manipulating prices with financial resources, although powerful, can be abandoned when it is profitable to do so. Those who do not abandon it are few. Or when their financial resources are insufficient, they cannot sustain it for long. Or if their access to capital is cut off, they cannot manipulate prices even if they want to. However, the harm of using influence to manipulate prices is unspeakable. They can forcibly requisition the products of farmers and merchants and monopolize their operations, so that prices do not fluctuate with the market but are arbitrarily set at high levels. They collect everything from all directions, and only the operators can benefit from it. Others cannot even inquire about it. Thus, the situation of state-run trusts is formed, and the daily necessities lose their regulation. Even if they do not monopolize operations, they restrict exports, shackle transportation, or "hide prohibition in taxation," levying exorbitant taxes and insatiable demands. How can the people have a day of respite, whether harvests are poor or abundant? How many crimes are committed in the name of control? Is this the original intention of control? Social unrest arises from the fact that the people's livelihood is not secure.</p>

<p>Hong Kong, Sources here learned today that goods such as tung oil, tungsten, antimony, and bristles, which are guaranteed to repay American loans, are being shipped to Japan at the request of Japanese inspectors in Guangzhou Bay [Kwangchow Bay]. As a result, Chinese exporters have refused to ship exports through Guangzhou Bay [Kwangchow Bay]. These goods are mostly produced in Guangxi [Kwangsi] and exported through Vietnam. Small amounts of other Chinese goods also have to pass through Guangzhou Bay [Kwangchow Bay] to reach Hong Kong. The supply of pigs, chickens, and ducks in Hong Kong comes from various places, so their prices have recently soared by 80 percent in the last two months. Even non-military or contraband goods destined for inland southwestern China from Britain and the United States are being detained in Guangzhou Bay [Kwangchow Bay] with no hope of being released. Chinese merchants have repeatedly negotiated, but to no avail. They finally plan to ship these goods back to Shanghai or Hong Kong, but they must apply for re-export permits. As a result, Guangzhou Bay [Kwangchow Bay] has become a dead market in July. A Chinese source reports that an American ship arrived in Guangzhou Bay [Kwangchow Bay] not long ago and unloaded tung oil intended for shipment to the United States via Manila, but no one has since inquired about it. Tung oil is now being shipped to Hong Kong from various places, and large quantities of tungsten ore are also stockpiled here to meet the needs of the United States and other neutral countries. Hong Kong newspapers say that the Chinese side is also stepping up its blockade of Guangzhou Bay [Kwangchow Bay] so that Japanese inspectors will not detain valuable military supplies for use in Japanese factories or sell them at high prices. A traveler who recently arrived in Hong Kong from the mainland via Vietnam said that Japanese inspectors impose heavy taxes on Chinese exports, with daily revenues reaching over 10,000 yuan in national currency. The Chinese side's counter-blockade plan aims to eliminate Japanese tax revenue. (29th International Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Civilian Casualties in Chongqing [Ch’ung-ch’ing] Bombings Mostly Poor <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing [Chungking], According to a report from the Joint Air Raid Relief Office, as of August 28th of this year, Chongqing [Ch’ung-ch’ing] has suffered 36 air raids, with a verified total of 7,084 bombs and 2,512 incendiary bombs dropped. Death benefits have been paid to the families of 1,205 people who died, disability benefits have been paid to 745 people with serious injuries, and 951 people with minor injuries. Those killed or injured in air raids are often poor, so the actual number of casualties is likely to be slightly higher than this figure. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Authorities Study Construction Work</p>
<p>Chongqing [Ch’ung-ch’ing], Mayor Wu Guozhen [Wu Kuo-chen] recently said that the air raid season is coming to an end, and the city authorities are currently studying construction work. Chinese banks have already donated $300,000, and will continue to support construction plans in the future. Other Chinese and foreign groups and individuals will also donate funds. In short, the reconstruction of Chongqing [Ch’ung-ch’ing] will be carried out in a systematic way, so that fires will not spread too widely when Japanese planes come to drop incendiary bombs in the future. As for the central area of the city, since it was bombed on the 19th and 20th of this month, three-quarters of the buildings have been reduced to ashes. Once reconstructed, there will be wide streets to separate the groups of buildings. Buildings made of brick and tile will not be allowed to exceed three stories in height, and every effort will be made to avoid using flammable building materials. During the reconstruction period, a portion of the funds will be used to build mat sheds to accommodate homeless refugees. Construction work has already begun to provide shelter for the 30,000 refugees in Chongqing [Ch’ung-ch’ing] who have lost their homes in air raids. The city government will also provide them with care and help them find work. In addition, the city government also plans to build a "New Life District" in the commercial center, including clubs, entertainment venues, hospitals, lecture halls, and so on. Madame Chiang [Chiang], the generalissimo's wife, has already donated $80,000 as seed money. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>Hanoi [Ha-noi], The situation in Vietnam is very peaceful today. Local French and Japanese authorities continue to conduct business negotiations. The French committee held a meeting on Wednesday, to which the Japanese were not invited. The results of the meeting were not announced. Railway traffic to and from Yunnan [Yunnan] is currently limited to transporting the private property of foreigners. French officials here deny that a fleet of French warships has arrived in Haiphong [Hai-phong], and also deny that a fleet of Japanese warships has arrived in the same area. They say that there is currently only one Japanese mine-laying ship berthed in Haiphong [Hai-phong]. Business traffic between the Japanese and Vietnamese is still normal, but two Japanese ships were forced to leave Haiphong [Hai-phong] in mid-August, and their cargo was not unloaded. It is believed that the ships were carrying military supplies, which the French authorities did not allow to enter the area. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Well-informed sources recently said that negotiations between Britain and France on resolving the Hong Kong-Vietnam shipping issue are underway. It is reported that an English ship sailed to Haiphong [Hai-phong] earlier this week and then turned back. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London, According to a statement issued yesterday by the Chinese Embassy here, the Japanese military occupation of the key bases in French Indochina is about to be realized. Information received here indicates that the Japanese are intercepting British and other countries' ships between Hong Kong and French Indochina. This information is supplemented by an official Chongqing [Ch’ung-ch’ing] statement issued by the Chinese Embassy. According to the official Chongqing [Ch’ung-ch’ing] statement, Japanese actions are intended to prevent foreign sailors from witnessing Japanese military preparations along the French Indochina coast. The embassy also stated that Japanese transport ships and warships have arrived in Hainan Island and the vicinity of the island. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>London – This morning, German air forces attempted to penetrate the London area from the southeast, engaging in a fierce air battle with British fighters. They were defeated. This shows that the German aerial blitz against England has increased in speed. A large number of British fighters participated in today's large-scale air battle, which took place over southeastern England. As a result, most of the German bombers turned back towards the coast. Although anti-aircraft batteries in a certain district of London opened fire and machine gun fire was heard, no bombs were dropped. An air raid alarm was issued in London for about half an hour. During this time, traffic remained congested, and many pedestrians stood on the sidewalks or continued to move forward. German planes, in formations of fifteen or twenty, apparently attempted to penetrate the southeastern defenses but were scattered by anti-aircraft fire and fighters. The German planes appeared to attack from several points. British anti-aircraft gunners opened fire first, and a few minutes later, fighters were spotted in the sky in succession. After a fierce air battle, the German planes retreated. At that time, another squadron of British fighters flew in and circled the area for some time before leaving. It is reported that at least six German planes were shot down in the air battle. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – This morning, two high-explosive bombs fell on London, killing and injuring several people in a residential area after the explosions. In addition, several bombs fell on the suburbs and surrounding areas, causing only minor damage. Most of London's residents were able to sleep peacefully last night, the first such night in a week. However, enemy aircraft were reported to have attacked other areas. The northwest and northeast of England were also attacked by enemy bombers several times, and the southwest was also disturbed. It is now believed that during recent night raids, members of the Fifth Column are signaling to the enemy. Several fires are suspected to have been caused by these individuals signaling to Nazi pilots. A bright light was seen flashing from a tall building in the London area, and the police rushed into the building and arrested a person for questioning. Last night, German planes dropped many bombs during the attack, mostly incendiary bombs, but most caused no damage. A certain town in the Midlands was attacked for the seventh time in five days, lasting for several hours. Incendiary bombs also fell in several other places. Anti-aircraft guns fired continuously at the German planes, and searchlights were very active. German planes flew over the northeast coast, traveling back and forth at high altitude over several towns. Several bombs fell in rural areas, reportedly damaging a water main. The northwest coastal area was bombed by the Germans for several hours. German planes circled over a large area in rotation, and anti-aircraft guns tracked and fired at them. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – This afternoon, a squadron of enemy planes flew into the southeastern area, and London issued another alarm. It is reported that the German formation was scattered by British fighters, and some German planes flew towards the coast. According to an Air Ministry communiqué, as of 2 p.m. (10 p.m. Shanghai time), a total of nineteen German planes were shot down by British fighters today, and six British planes were lost, but the crew of one of them escaped safely.

<p>British Air Force Takes Offensive Against Germany</p>
<p>London – British authorities announced yesterday that the Royal Air Force now has a systematic plan to completely destroy dozens of important military targets in the Berlin area. British authorities say that this destruction plan will be as precise and as successful as the recent destruction of 175 German industrial areas. In order to achieve this goal of destruction, the industrial areas of western Germany have been bombed more than 50 times. British authorities also stated that German military targets, after repeated bombing, have been completely destroyed, including the Dornier aircraft factory in Wismar and the Focke-Wulf aircraft factory in Bremen. It is said that the British are bombing heavily to destroy large numbers of new German fighters, which are said to be far superior to the British Spitfire. Before the Focke-Wulf factory was destroyed, the Germans were already engaged in manufacturing this type of aircraft. (30th International dispatch)</p>
<p>London – An Air Ministry communiqué stated that on Wednesday night, British bombers launched large-scale attacks on military targets in Germany, the Netherlands, and occupied France. Important targets in the Berlin area were also heavily bombed. Other British planes bombed the aircraft skeleton factory in Leipzig, the Junkers aircraft factory in Dessau, oil plants in Reichenbach and other places, and several airfields in Germany. A large ship in a canal near Reisena, 25 miles west of Berlin, was hit and exploded. All British planes returned, and two were forced to land, but the crew members were all safe. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>British Airmen Describe Long-Range Experiences</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry Information Office announced last night that British Air Force pilots are now vying to be sent to attack Berlin. The British selected aircraft from two squadrons to attack Berlin, gathering and taking off in the twilight. Seven hours later, the first plane returned, the crew calm and collected, entering the intelligence room to report on the attack. Shortly thereafter, the remaining aircraft returned in succession. According to the captain of the second British plane, which bombed a power station, "We bombed at midnight. Before our plane arrived, friendly aircraft had already arrived, so when our plane arrived from north to south, we saw that the target was already ablaze. We dropped bombs to the left of the fire, and four other places caught fire, with white light flashing and everything brightly lit. Twenty-five minutes after leaving the area and turning back, we could still see the flames raging. Five planes circled over Berlin for half an hour. At the same time, there were quite a few British planes soaring over the city of Berlin, and other British planes were active in the suburbs." Another pilot said, "Our plane circled over the city of Berlin for fifty minutes and saw friendly aircraft drop eight to ten flares and more than ten batches of bombs." One pilot said that a German plane was shot down by its own defenses. When the plane he was flying returned after dropping its bombs, the flames could still be seen shooting into the sky from 50 miles away. When the British plane approached Berlin, it could already see flames raging, forming a line half a mile long. The plane then dived from 12,000 feet to 5,000 feet to bomb the power station. Another target in the Berlin area was repeatedly bombed by British planes from 11:35 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. One of the first British planes to attack saw that the bombs it dropped hit the target and exploded, causing a large fire. Several British planes specifically attacked a target only four miles from the center of Berlin. At that time, the searchlights were flashing densely, and there was smoke, making it impossible for the pilots to see the results of the bombing. However, a few minutes after midnight, another British plane arrived and dropped high-explosive bombs and incendiary bombs. The smoke had dissipated, and fires were seen breaking out in the southern and central parts of the target area. At 0:20 a.m., the buildings in the target area were bombed again, causing a violent explosion. Fifteen minutes later, flames shot into the sky. A factory near Lake Tegel in Berlin was also bombed and caught fire. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Southern England Defenses Strengthened</p>
<p>London – A Reuters correspondent reports from Southern Command that the British forces in the south have not been discouraged by Hitler's aerial blitz. They are now prepared for two possibilities: that southern England will not only be the landing site for a German invasion but also the starting point for a British offensive. Lieutenant General Auchinleck, commander-in-chief of the South, who led troops against the Germans in Narvik, told a Reuters reporter that Southern Command is prepared to invade enemy territory one day, using German tactics with improvements to defeat the German army, that is, "to use their own methods to defeat them." The troops in the South and throughout England are known for their flexibility, and they will use this to devise tactics that are superior to those of the Germans. Many divisions in General Auchinleck's army fought in France with the British Expeditionary Force. Since the evacuation from Dunkirk, the younger soldiers who have replenished their strength have heard other soldiers describe the fighting in France and are eager to try their hand. These British soldiers are no longer worried that the Battle of Britain is about to take place. The 500-mile coastline from the Thames Estuary to the Severn is now guarded by soldiers to prevent possible landings. British soldiers are currently being trained for a counterattack against Germany, and their numbers are increasing daily, thanks to the increasingly solid coastal defenses. Britain now has the latest methods to harass invading enemy forces, methods that are simple and terrifying but must currently be kept secret. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Minor Losses from Air Raids in England</p>
<p>London – An Air Ministry official recently stated that the German air force's strategy is to circle London under the cover of darkness and clouds, dropping bombs only occasionally and aimlessly. Their purpose is only to terrorize civilians, but the residents of London all know that the Germans' attempt has completely failed. The German planes attack aimlessly, and the bombing is ineffective. Yesterday afternoon, another act of terror took place in a town in southern England when a German plane strafed civilians working in the fields. Fortunately, they escaped death by throwing themselves to the ground. At the same time, a Messerschmitt German plane suddenly appeared in a town in the southeast, diving and strafing. A barrage balloon was hit, caught fire, and fell to the ground. The German plane turned around and flew away. It returned a few minutes later and shot down two barrage balloons that were lined up, flying very low through intense anti-aircraft fire. Two swastikas could be seen on the ground. The plane then shot down another barrage balloon before escaping, apparently unharmed. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>German Announcement of Air Force Results</p>
<p>Berlin – A German military expert yesterday issued the following supplementary war report to Haisong News Agency, stating that German planes targeted airfields north and east of the British capital for bombing yesterday. The damage to the Stotfield Eastern Church airfield was particularly heavy, with many aircraft hangars hit and destroyed. On the morning of the 28th, German planes bombed the Hatfield and Heimsweil airfields, with great success. On the same day, German planes bombed port facilities at Middlesbrough, Thames Haven, Chesham, and Liverpool. German planes also carried out group bombings of British armaments factory centers in Sheffield and Birmingham, as well as armaments factories in Coventry and other places. In the air battles that took place at that time, 44 British planes and one barrage balloon were shot down. The Germans lost 15 planes. British air raids on the English Channel coast and the Netherlands produced few results. From the night of the 28th to the morning of the 29th, British planes attacked Berlin, apparently targeting residential areas of the German capital for bombing. Many bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped, and many houses were hit and caught fire, killing ten civilians and injuring twenty-eight. They were killed because they had not taken shelter in air raid shelters. Other losses were extremely light, proving the thoroughness of Berlin's air defense measures. No military targets were damaged. One British plane was shot down by German anti-aircraft guns. The German Air Force continued to attack coastal shipping in England and lay mines. Submarines commanded by Captain Spuk sank a total of seven British armed merchant ships, totaling 43,000 tons. (30th Haisong dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin – The German High Command announced this afternoon that while the German Air Force's activities yesterday were aimed at reconnaissance, several air battles still took place in southeastern England. Last night, German planes attacked the airfields of Lincoln and Suffolk, the factory in Felixstowe, the aircraft manufacturing field in Weihe, the aircraft manufacturing field in Langreith Ross, the port works of Dundee, Laith, Hartlepool, and Liverpool. The fire in Liverpool was the largest. The Germans also laid mines near British ports. British planes bombed non-military buildings in western Germany last night. Several houses in towns in the Ruhr area were hit and caught fire, but were extinguished by firefighters. The losses were very small. Two enemy planes were shot down by anti-aircraft guns during the attack on the Ruhr. During the daytime air battles, nineteen enemy planes and six barrage balloons were shot down. Seven German planes did not return to their original defenses. A German submarine sank three enemy merchant ships at night, totaling 21,000 tons. (30th Haisong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e22">British Military Strategy Effective in African Desert; Italian Forces in Libya Unable to Attack <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Cairo – The British Army's strategy in the western desert during the initial weeks of the war against Italy, aimed at preventing Italian forces from crossing the Libyan border province, has now been effective, beyond initial expectations. The British Navy has recently cooperated with this strategy. The Italians had intended to concentrate their main forces in Bardia to launch an offensive, but this plan has been thwarted by the British strategy. The coast near Bardia that can be used to garrison troops is very narrow and cannot avoid the fire of the British fleet. If they were to advance south into the desert, it would require a great price and long-term preparations to succeed. Therefore, the Italians have no choice but to disperse their forces and halt their offensive. The Italian air raids on Alexandria and the western desert are gradually decreasing, while the British Air Force continues to bomb enemy supply stations and seaports. The Italian actions planned in North Africa will likely fall into one of the following three categories: (1) attacking the Nile Delta at all costs, hoping that Abyssinia will no longer be trapped by British forces; (2) continuing the current attitude to hold up a large number of British troops in the western desert; (3) accumulating materials so that they can negotiate favorable armistice conditions in the future. The second option is the most likely to be realized, but whether the enemy can endure the constant bombardment of the navy and air force remains to be seen. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>London – A Reuters British military correspondent reports that after the British disrupted air traffic between Libya and Abyssinia, Abyssinia was further isolated from the outside world. The Italian forces in Abyssinia, including one Italian division and twelve brigades composed of local troops, are in an unenviable position, as unrest often breaks out in Abyssinia, requiring troops to suppress it. Strategically, although the Italians have occupied British Somaliland, they have not strengthened their position in Abyssinia, but have weakened their forces due to dispersal, as the line of communication between British Somaliland and Harar, the starting point of the Italian offensive, is long and difficult to defend. Although the coast between Zeila and Berbera is occupied by the Italians, it is worthless without the help of the navy. The gasoline, ammunition, and bombs stored in Abyssinia are only sufficient for a short period. Since the invasion of British Somaliland, this reserve has been greatly reduced, and the Italian hope of transporting supplies through Libya via Kufra to make up for the lack has now been shattered by British air strikes.

<p>Rome – According to the Italian Military Headquarters, Italian aircraft bombed the Halfar Naval Port on Malta. British planes engaged in combat and three were damaged by Italian machine gun fire. In North Africa, Italian planes repeatedly bombed British ammunition depots, a barracks, and warehouses in Mersa Matruh, dropping hundreds of bombs. In East Africa, Italian planes bombed troop concentrations near Kenya Garissa and the Koto Force, and bombed the Buna airfield. One plane at the field was destroyed and two were damaged. Several Italian planes were damaged, but all returned to their bases, and none of the pilots were injured. The attack on Buna destroyed one British vehicle, and the British suffered heavy losses. British planes bombed Mogadishu three times, killing two civilians and injuring six, with minimal damage. (30th Haisong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>London – A recent Italian communiqué contains a rather amusing description, stating that when the Italian bomber squadron flew over the naval base of Migabba in Malta for an air raid, the British fighters in the air did not engage the Italian planes but tried to escape. However, regarding the losses of the British planes, it only stated that three British planes were damaged by machine gun fire. The communiqué also stated that Italian planes bombed Mogadishu three times yesterday. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Gibraltar – A Reuters correspondent reports that the Italian fleet is now mostly moored in port, while the British fleet continues to cruise the sea, never slacking, in order to search for enemy ships, show off its skills, and train to boost the morale of its officers and men. The reporter accompanied the naval air arm on an aircraft carrier, traveling back and forth at sea for four days. Berlin has repeatedly falsely claimed to have sunk the ship. Life on the aircraft carrier is exciting and orderly, and there is harmony and friendship between officers and men, but discipline and courtesy are not relaxed in the slightest.

<h3 id="e27">British Planes' Excellent Concealment Technique; Fuselage Painted with Secret Black Paint <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Berlin – German Air Force intelligence sources here announced last night that the British planes that recently attacked Germany have a special paint on their fuselages that prevents searchlights from detecting them. It is said that these planes have a thick black paint on the underside of the plane. This is a British secret invention. Whenever a British plane is shot down, the underside is painted with this secret paint. Whenever car headlights come into contact with the fuselage, the plane immediately disappears. For this reason, German anti-aircraft guns can only return fire by reflecting the black shadows in the eastern clouds, while the plane itself is completely invisible. Intelligence sources also stated that the British planes that recently attacked Berlin often fly at altitudes of 6,000 to 15,000 feet. The constant changes in the altitude of the planes and the sound of the engines make it difficult for German anti-aircraft guns to retaliate, as sound detectors are also difficult to use. It is said that the squadrons are divided into countless teams, like waves, with each team staying over Berlin for an average of ten to fifteen minutes. As one team passes, the second team follows. German air force officials praised the British squadron's journey to Berlin, especially the air raids in bad weather, calling it "a miracle of navigation." (30th United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington – President Roosevelt's Western Hemisphere defense program gained further momentum yesterday, as the Senate passed the "Overall Defense" bill, which allocates funds to build a two-ocean navy and 18,422 warplanes. This massive national defense bill, which includes US$5,133,169,277 in funding, was passed by the Senate by a vote of 51 to 28. There was a fierce debate before the bill was passed. This bill was passed by the House of Representatives earlier this month. The bill provides for the construction of 18,422 aircraft, of which 4,028 will belong to the Navy. If so, the total number of Navy aircraft will increase to 10,028. The remaining 14,394 will belong to the Army. If so, the total number of Army aircraft will increase to 25,000. The bill also provides US$352,000 for the improvement of Guam, US$1,200,000 for the improvement of Hawaii, US$535,500 for the improvement of Midway, and US$180,000 for the improvement of Alaska.

<h3 id="e29">US Military Experts Discuss National Defense Plan: Complete Modernization of the Army <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Washington – US military experts recently stated that the current US Army, undergoing a national defense plan, will be fully capable of launching a counterattack against blitzkrieg tactics in the future. Although the US war plan is only conceived for defense, it is based on offensive methods. With the new equipment and the expansion of personnel, the US Army may be able to fight against the forces of terror. What the United States is currently focusing on is building sufficient equipment for one million people, the mechanization of regular army divisions, and the training of rapid tank fleets. These two aspects are being carried out in every army unit. A large-scale exercise is also planned for the beginning of the second year to test the increased military strength of the army. Experts recalled that a year ago, the regular army was less than 150,000 men, a third of whom were stationed in remote areas such as the Canal Zone, Hawaii, and the Philippines. Today, the army is rapidly increasing, with the regular army approaching 300,000 men. The National Guard is also expanding and being mobilized, and the construction of mechanized equipment has factories working at an unprecedented speed. It is roughly estimated that by mid-1940, the value of all contracts ordered for building army equipment will be US$2 billion. This is truly the largest peacetime expenditure in American history. The newly added troops, once equipped, will be partly vehicle-borne, partly foot-borne, and partly horse-borne. The army's mechanized units will have the newest, best, and fastest armored vehicles. Tank fleets will possess a variety of massive and irresistible weapons. Each army unit will have superior shooting weapons compared to similar units in the world. Infantry will have semi-automatic rifles, the effectiveness of which will surpass that of any country's infantry. In defensive key areas such as Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Canal Zone, the number of aircraft has also been increased. Every defensive point is being rapidly improved to make it difficult for the enemy to attack. Regarding the defense of the Philippine Islands, it remains the undecided part of the national defense issue. The national defense plan does not specify the degree of defense responsibility for this American bulge in the Far East. Many experts believe that the US Army and Navy will not engage in a major war in the Far East, nor will they resist foreign aggression against the Philippines. Because the Philippines is scheduled to become fully independent on July 4, 1946, the US long-range defense plan does not include the Philippines. However, the Philippine issue is still of deep concern to US defense planners, because while the American flag is still flying on the island, the United States cannot but care about its defense.

<p>Washington – The President yesterday directed Undersecretary of State Welles to be the US representative to the Emergency Committee. The Emergency Committee is a product of the Havana Conference. The Havana Conference last month decided to establish an Emergency Committee to assume temporary management of European territories in the Western Hemisphere once they are threatened by non-American countries. Currently, none of the European countries with territories in the Western Hemisphere agree with this proposal. However, this agreement is unilateral and does not require European countries' recognition. (United Press dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Sydney – Local officials today declared that Australia is now united in supporting Prime Minister Menzies' "all-out" war policy. Reservists are flocking to report to their units, and the rate of manufacturing aircraft, ordnance, and other war materials is increasing greatly. According to local observer reports, workers and the public alike unanimously support every newly issued war measure. In the near future, Australia will have three new divisions available to be deployed to the front lines, including several small teams of various experts. Veterans of the last war have now been granted government permission to organize a domestic self-defense volunteer corps, expected to attract 100,000 men over the age of forty. The strength of the Royal Australian Air Force is increasing daily, and the Navy is serving on the sea day and night. The government has taken all steps to ensure that 250,000 men are constantly under military training, including the Australian Imperial Army. To achieve this goal, the age for compulsory training has been lowered, and older men are also allowed to volunteer. The authorities have also allocated A$8 million to build eight new training camps for soldiers. The production of shells has now increased thirteenfold, bombs twentyfold, gunpowder fivefold, cartridge cases sevenfold, and small arms fourfold. It is expected that by the end of this year, the rate of this manufacturing can be doubled. The recent cost of the ordnance manufacturing program is A$50 million, employing at least 150,000 men and women. To support this policy, the government has passed a law similar to that in Britain, to increase taxes without restriction, control personal property, manage workers and employers, and force people to undergo military training. Prime Minister Menzies stated, "If necessary, the government will increase taxes as much as possible, even if the entire economic structure collapses, because economic collapse is far better than national collapse."

<p>Vienna – Romanian Foreign Minister Manoilescu held talks with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano at the Hotel Imperial yesterday, lasting for one hour and thirty-five minutes. He left at 4:15 PM. The preparatory negotiations between the Romanian and Hungarian representatives are still unknown at this time, and it is also unknown how Germany and Italy will facilitate understanding between the two parties. But one thing can be determined: the development of the negotiations still has no definite plan. It is therefore impossible to determine when the four foreign ministers will hold a joint meeting. An official spokesman stated yesterday that the participants in the Vienna Conference are all acting voluntarily, and the purpose is to establish peace and order and thereby lay the foundation for the situation in Southeastern Europe. Now that Romania and Hungary have encountered difficult events of a racial, territorial, and historical nature that the two parties cannot resolve, the Vienna Conference was convened.

The communiqué was signed by the government and the leaders of various parties. Therefore, the opposition also shares the government's responsibility for accepting the arbitration award.

<p>Moscow – Regarding the provocative actions of the Romanian army on the Soviet-Romanian border, Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs Dekanozov lodged a protest with the Romanian envoy to the Soviet Union, Gafencu, on the 29th. The protest note solemnly stated that the Romanian army repeatedly opened fire on the Soviet border guards on the border, forcing the Soviet side to retaliate. Such actions by the Romanian army were absolutely intolerable to the Soviet side. Yesterday, Dekanozov again delivered a note to the Romanian envoy, lodging a serious protest against the new hostile actions of the Romanian border guards and other Romanian military aircraft violating the border. The note stated that the Soviet side has not yet suffered any losses, but if the Soviet side has suffered losses, the situation will inevitably become serious. The Romanian government should bear full responsibility for all serious consequences that may be caused by the above-mentioned actions of the Romanian army and Romanian aircraft. On the same day, the Romanian envoy handed Dekanozov the Romanian government's reply to the Soviet government's note of August 19. In the reply, the Romanian government defended the Romanian army's firing alleged in the Soviet note, and at the same time stated that the Romanian government had instructed the border guards to do their best to avoid any accidents that could damage the friendly relations between the two countries. In addition, the Romanian envoy also said that Soviet troops and Soviet aircraft had crossed the border. Dekanozov immediately replied that the information provided by the Romanian envoy about the Soviet troops crossing the border was still awaiting investigation and confirmation, and said that although the Romanian government had instructed the border guards to avoid accidents, the Romanian army was still violating the border. Therefore, the Soviet government believes that the Romanian government should give a satisfactory answer to the new Soviet protest today. (TASS dispatch, 30th)</p>

The newspaper continued that the activities of German warships in the waters off Australia and India indicate that the war is now gradually extending from the West to the East, especially to the waters near the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, but its scale is still small. When asked whether the Japanese government held the same opinion as the newspaper, the spokesman replied that the newspaper's opinion was deeply moving. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Since the withdrawal of British defense forces from the Public Concession, the defense of its remaining B District has been temporarily filled by the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. However, the Japanese side does not agree with teams other than British teams in the Corps. Therefore, the Municipal Council had to summon all British teams, namely A Company, the Armored Car Team, and the Light Horse Team, in turn to take over the defense of the western district of Hongkou. However, the number of British teams is not large, and they all have occupations, so they feel extremely difficult with the defense. According to sources yesterday, the Municipal Council Corps Commander Humpheys has decided to summon the American B Company (ie, the Second Battalion) of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, which was previously opposed by the Japanese side, to assist in the defense. An order has been issued yesterday, scheduled to gather at 12:30 this afternoon to stand by, and will soon be dispatched to assist in the deficiency of the British Corps. The B Company has 70 American teams, 100 Portuguese teams, more than 70 Filipino teams, and more than 50 American machine gun teams, totaling 300 people. The commander is American lawyer Rogers.

After the postage increase, domestic letters should be affixed with the following postage rates: ordinary letters will be 10 cents (currently 5 cents), single registered letters will be 18 cents (currently 13 cents), double registered letters will be 26 cents (currently 21 cents), express registered letters will be 22 cents (currently 17 cents), and airmail letters will be 60 cents (currently the same as ordinary postage which is 10 cents; local postage is rumored to increase to 4 cents).</p>
<p>Exemptions from Price Increase</p>
<p>The remaining items such as newspapers, books, printed materials, trade contracts, samples, and business leaflets will not be increased. The new postage stamps reflecting the increased postage amounts have been commissioned to be printed in Hong Kong. During the period when the new value stamps are being issued, the old value stamps can also be used, as long as the correct postage amount is affixed.</p>
<p>Scope of Price Increase</p>
<p>Finally, according to Datong News Agency inquiries, Hong Kong, Macau, and leased territories in Guangzhou (such as Guangzhou Bay), and Japan, because the values of their affixed stamps have always been the same as domestic postage rates, will also be subject to the same increase. Foreign postage rates were increased once last year and must be coordinated with postage rates in other countries, so there will be no further increase this time. Parcel postage rates will be determined based on transportation conditions and may be increased at any time, so they are not included in this postage increase.</p>
<p>Shanghai Post Office Preparations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has not yet received a clear order from the Ministry of Communications, but it is prepared to implement the changes at the same time as the post offices in the Southwest and Fujian-Zhejiang areas when it receives an order from the General Administration. Inquiries reveal that postal delivery has been quite difficult recently due to inconvenient transportation and recent increases in commodity price indexes. The increase in postage rates is, therefore, a natural and reasonable step.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of Japan's war of aggression against China, the mobilization of troops and the involvement of the masses for three years has yielded no achievements. As a result, the cabinet has been changed four times, and efforts have been made to reorganize the diplomatic lineup in the hope of making a final struggle in diplomatic policy. Recently, a large number of ambassadors and ministers stationed in various countries, as well as 40 others below them, have been recalled to their home countries, and extreme figures have been appointed to succeed them. Although it is difficult to predict how things will evolve in the future, it is still worth paying attention to. Shanghai Consul General Miura Yoshiaki is also on the list of those to be recalled. His successor is Horiuchi Kanjō.</p>
<p>Farewell Banquet Prepared Before Departure</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, someone visited Consul General Miura and asked if he had received the recall order. He replied that he had not yet received it and also declined to express any opinion on the recall of 40 ambassadors and ministers below them. It is expected that the order will arrive here within the next day or two. At 10 PM the day before yesterday, the owner of a restaurant on Zha Pu Road in Hongkou, knowing that Miura was about to depart, hosted a grand banquet to bid him farewell. Miura has served as Consul General of Shanghai since January 4 of last year, and it has been a year and a half since then.</p>
<p>Horiuchi Kanjō Called a China Expert</p>
<p>His successor, Horiuchi Kanjō, is currently the Director of the East Asia Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is 52 years old, a graduate of the Shanghai Tongwen College, and then returned to Japan to enter the Department of Political Science at Kyoto Imperial University. He is one of the leading China experts. He has resided in Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin), Nanjing, and other places for nearly 20 years, so he is proficient in the Chinese language. His former name was Kame Taro, which was later changed to Kanjō.</p>

<p>At approximately 6:30 AM the day before yesterday (the 29th), three or four Japanese military police, together with three or four detectives from the Public Works Department, suddenly arrived at the Jiangsu Hotel at No. 50, Lane 379, Guangdong Road, and arrested two lodgers, Lü Shouxin and Zhou Chunfu, residing in Room 95. Inquiries into the situation revealed the following:</p>
<p>Rarely Went Out</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 18th of this month, two travelers carrying a leather suitcase went to the Jiangsu Hotel and opened Room 95. They wrote down Lü Shouxin's name in the registration book, stating that he was from Jiangsu Province, 25 years old, and worked in business. However, their accents did not sound like Jiangsu. The two slept in the same bed and rarely went out. Sometimes they called female guides for entertainment. Their clothing was sometimes Chinese and sometimes Western, and it was inconsistent.</p>
<p>Sudden Arrival of Police</p>
<p>Initially, they borrowed a radio and listened to it frequently, and returned it on the 28th. Unexpectedly, the unfortunate incident occurred on the morning of the 29th. When the police arrived, the two were still fast asleep. The police woke them up, ordered them to put on their clothes, handcuffed them, and took away their suitcases. To this day, the hotel still has 40.67 yuan that was advanced for their meals.</p>

<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that an official of the Public Works Department recently stated that the Japanese had blocked the junction of Yihua Road and Yangshupu Road. The Public Works Department has lodged a protest with the Japanese authorities but has not yet received a reply. The official could not say whether the Public Works Department would lodge another protest regarding this matter. According to reports, at the beginning of this month, several Japanese wharves in the Yangshupu area merged and arbitrarily blocked Yihua Road, which leads to the public wharves. When the East Asia Shipping Company and Osaka Steamship Company, whose wharves are on both sides of Yihua Road, merged, they built a barrier at the junction of Yihua Road, prohibiting all traffic to the public wharves.</p>

<h3 id="e52">Price Assessment Committee to Implement Today - Increase Assessment of Foreign Rice Prices - Rice Stocks Abundant but Hoarders Refuse to Sell <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>In order to negotiate specific measures to stabilize the rice market, the Shanghai Rice Price Assessment Committee held its fourth standing committee meeting at its office at 15 Avenue Edward VII at 4 PM yesterday. Representatives from the French Concession Price Assessment Committee, Xie Xuefang, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Zhong Jinzhen, as well as all members of the committee, attended. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to send letters to the authorities of the two concessions and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, urging all industries to unite and purchase rice in groups to increase their reserves and stabilize rice prices. The assessments of various types of foreign rice have been revised (see notice) and will be announced to the market for implementation starting today. The meeting adjourned at about 6 PM.</p>
<p>Assessed Prices</p>
<p>As a result of yesterday's discussions, the committee decided to increase prices appropriately based on production costs and announced the following to the market this morning: "It has been found that foreign rice production costs have been rising recently, exceeding the current selling prices in this port by a growing margin. Although domestic early rice has appeared on the market, the supply is still blocked. If this continues, it will be difficult to increase reserves. Therefore, this committee convened a standing committee meeting to seriously discuss and reassess the highest market prices for various types of foreign rice, taking into account the current situation, as listed below (effective August 31st): No. 1 Saigon Siam Rice: 61.50 yuan; Fire Brand Rice: 61 yuan; No. 2 Saigon Siam Rice: 59 yuan; Small Brand Rice: 59 yuan; High-grade Tokyo Milled Rice: 56 yuan; Tokyo Brown Rice: 52 yuan; Milu Rice: 50 yuan; Mixed Broken Rice: 46 yuan. The above prices must be strictly observed. Buying and selling in the market is only allowed below these prices and may not exceed the limits. If any under-the-table transactions are discovered, they will be reported to the authorities of the two concessions for severe punishment. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Rampant Hoarding</p>
<p>Recently, rice speculators have been making waves, hoarding large quantities of rice and taking the opportunity to raise prices in order to make huge profits without working. As a result, the entire rice market has been unstable. This time, they are taking advantage of the disruption of shipping between Shanghai and Vietnam and the interruption of the supply of Saigon foreign rice, believing that the opportunity has come again. They continue to be disruptive, causing widespread rumors and anxiety. The market is extremely chaotic, with each side raising prices and the "scalping" trend reviving. Foreign rice is being bought and sold in the market at prices exceeding the limits, and under-the-table transactions are also rampant. However, these speculative profiteers completely disregard the authorities' warnings and act lawlessly, which is a great crime. Now, the four million citizens of the city are eagerly awaiting the authorities of the two concessions to investigate strictly and punish them in accordance with the regulations, in order to eliminate illegal transactions and stabilize the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Rice Stocks Abundant</p>
<p>Reporters from the New Voice News Agency separately inquired with the rice industry yesterday and learned that rice stocks in the city's rice mills are currently extremely abundant, and there is no shortage of food for the population. According to a report from the Shanghai Rice Price Assessment Committee, the committee's survey this week (from last Thursday to this Thursday) found a total of 745,908 bags of rice in the stocks of various rice warehouses, of which: (1) the stocks of the Laotaigu, Longmao, and Qichang warehouses in Pudong are the largest; (2) the stocks of the Gonghexing warehouse in Hongkou are the second largest; and (3) the stocks of the Bank of China and Maotai warehouses in the Central District are the third largest. This does not include rice stored in rice shops and homes in the two concessions. However, the bulk of the rice is owned by hoarders, and only about half of it is circulating on the market. Moreover, in the past few days, rice has continued to arrive from abroad in a steady stream, and daily arrivals and sales are enough to maintain equilibrium. However, the buying and selling of goods in the market each day has nothing to do with the production costs in various places. The rise in rice prices in the market is clearly due to the fact that speculators are manipulating spot goods. It is reported that it has been difficult to buy good foreign rice yesterday, which shows the ulterior motives of the speculative hoarders.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Exchange of British Banknotes Not Prohibited - Money Exchange Businesses Put Up Rates at Any Time <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Since the United Kingdom banned the import of British banknotes, British banks in China and the Bank of China of the Ministry of Finance have stopped exchanging British banknotes as scheduled. The Shanghai money exchange market, in view of the fact that British banknotes are not absolutely prohibited from circulation but are only not allowed to be imported into the United Kingdom, and that travelers to the United Kingdom can carry ten pounds for import at any time, still accepts small amounts of British banknotes. Because the association has actual transactions, it temporarily lists exchange rates. For example, yesterday it was 53.50 yuan. Whether to continue listing rates will depend on whether there are any transactions.</p>
<p>Exchange Amount Never Announced</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Bank of China has stopped exchanging British banknotes as scheduled after receiving the order. It has not accepted any since yesterday morning. The total amount of British banknotes received has been summarized and shipped to the United Kingdom and has been sent to the London branch of the Bank of China by post before midnight the day before yesterday. The Bank of China's London branch has been informed. According to the usual practice in business, the total amount of British banknotes exchanged by the bank will never be announced to the outside world. It is reported that the London branch of the Bank of China has reported to the British Treasury regarding the remedial measures for remittances after the ban on the import of British banknotes for the record.</p>
<p>Small Amounts of British Banknotes Still Accepted</p>
<p>Reporters from the New Voice News Agency inquired with HSBC and Chartered Bank yesterday and learned that after the British banks stopped exchanging British banknotes, they have reported the total amount of British banknotes received to their London head offices. They will ship the British banknotes to the United Kingdom in batches by mail. It is reported that although the exchange period has ended, small amounts of British banknotes from customers will still be exchanged at their discretion. Therefore, British banknotes will still have a legal tender exchange rate in China in the future, as British banknotes are the currency system of the United Kingdom and can still be used at home and abroad, but may not be freely imported into the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Responsibility for Posting British Banknotes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has not received any orders from the Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Communications regarding the United Kingdom's ban on the import of British banknotes. Therefore, it will continue to accept and post British banknotes to the United Kingdom as usual for the time being and will not prohibit it. However, if there are any obstacles along the way, the sender will be responsible. If the British Post Office refuses to import the item after it arrives at its destination, the post office will return the original item to the sender. However, since the United Kingdom has issued an order prohibiting the import of British banknotes, those in China who hold British banknotes and want to mail them to the United Kingdom should pay special attention to avoid suffering unexpected losses.</p>

There may be new developments within days. When the situation becomes clear, the Shanghai-Hong Kong-Fangchenggang shipping route can be restored. Therefore, the current situation is only a temporary suspension.</p>

Finally, they intruded into Jinhua South Street and dropped 18 bombs. The damage is unknown. The Japanese planes then returned along the same route and escaped out to sea.</p>
<p>Shelling of Shipu</p>
<p>Japanese warships also patrolled the waters of Zhejiang frequently the day before yesterday, and even shelled Shipu. The Japanese warship that shelled Shipu arrived the day before yesterday and anchored in Jietou Harbor, opposite Shipu. At dawn the day before yesterday, it suddenly fired ten shots at the Jiang'an coast of Shipu. The sound of artillery fire was deafening and lasted for more than ten minutes before ceasing. An investigation revealed that the shells all landed in the mudflats and there was no damage. Also, two Japanese warships sailed to the waters of Yueqing the day before yesterday. Eight planes were stationed on the ships, and they were still anchored there in the evening without any movement.</p>
<p>Dinghai Airfield</p>
<p>According to news from Dinghai, the Japanese troops of Shima Shigeo's unit have recently been building a seaplane field in the waters east of Laoshujiao, opposite the Minsheng Fine Salt Company outside the East Gate of Dinghai City, adding many signs around it. A large number of bombs have been placed in the warehouses of the fine salt factory. Since the outbreak of the war in Zhenhai, bombers and fighters have been taking off every morning and returning after several hours. They are flying to various parts of Eastern Zhejiang to drop bombs and wreak havoc.</p>
<p>Pujiang Robbery Case - Water Patrol Office Investigates - Robbed Ship Name Not Shantai</p>
<p>A report in the *North China Daily News* stated that the Portuguese merchant Zhengde Shipping Company's Shantai was boarded and robbed by armed bandits at night on the 24th of this month at No. 11 floating pontoon in the Pujiang River in Nanshi.

According to a letter from the company, the Shantai ship of the company is docked at No. J6 to J7 floating pontoon in Nanshi, and the captain is not Aquino. There was no robbery on the ship that day. Perhaps another ship was mistakenly docked at No. J11 floating pontoon. However, it is heard that the Water Patrol Office has now begun investigating this case, and it will not be difficult to clarify it.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Hanner Returned from Gu'ao - Detailed Account of Japanese Warship Obstruction - Japanese Naval Attaché's "Guarantee" Ineffective - Foreign Passengers Were Also Unable to Land <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reports that the German merchant Lihe Company's Hanner, a 1,000-ton ship, sailed to Gu'aotou in southern Zhejiang and was fired upon by the Japanese Navy once and boarded by Japanese soldiers three times. At 4 AM today (the 30th), the ship returned to Shanghai. Twenty foreign passengers, including British, American, German, Australian, and Canadian missionaries, returned on the ship because they were not allowed to land at Gu'aotou. According to one passenger, the details of the Hanner's trip were as follows:</p>
<p>Guarantee Ineffective</p>
<p>The Hanner obtained a customs clearance certificate and a guarantee from the Japanese military attaché in Shanghai that the ship would be allowed to sail to Gu'aotou without obstruction. It left Shanghai at 6 PM on the 24th of this month and headed for Gu'aotou. Captain Hamann had a notice issued by the Japanese authorities stating the restricted navigation areas along the Chinese coast, and Gu'aotou was not among them. The Hanner had no incidents for 22 hours after sailing. At 4 PM on the 25th, when it was four miles away from Dog Head Island (transliteration), Japanese auxiliary ship No. 31 ordered the Hanner to stop.</p>
<p>Warning Shot</p>
<p>A warning shot was fired at the ship, and the bullet fell into the water a short distance from the ship. The Hanner dropped anchor and temporarily anchored overnight. The next morning, two Japanese officers and several soldiers boarded the ship to check the documents. Captain Hamann showed a notice issued by the commander of the Japanese fleet in China, proving that the Hanner was not sailing in a Japanese restricted area. The Japanese officer then told the German captain that the Hanner's sailing area had just been added to the restricted area. The Japanese officer heard that the Hanner was sailing to Gu'aotou and said that Gu'aotou was an undefended port and was "dangerous," and it would be better to return to Shanghai. However, the German captain refused. After the Hanner was allowed to continue sailing for about two hours, it was blocked again by the auxiliary ship Japan Maru.</p>
<p>Arrived Outside Port</p>
<p>Japanese officers and soldiers boarded the ship, but they behaved very politely and admitted that Gu'aotou was not on the restricted list. However, they also persuaded the German captain to return to Shanghai. The Hanner still ignored it and finally arrived outside Gu'aotou on the morning of the 27th. Unexpectedly, it was ordered to stop by a nearby Japanese destroyer. Four Japanese officers and several soldiers boarded the ship. The German captain again showed the Japanese notice, but the Japanese officer did not allow it to enter Gu'aotou. After checking the documents, he expressed doubt about the ship's nationality, saying that it had been registered in the name of a Chinese merchant in 1937. After speaking, he took the ship's documents back to the destroyer. The Hanner was forced to anchor overnight.</p>
<p>Ordered to Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>The next morning, Japanese officers and soldiers boarded the Hanner again. The captain requested permission for 20 foreign passengers to land, but was unsuccessful. The ship was ordered to return to Shanghai at noon. When the Hanner was anchored outside Gu'aotou, there was no activity taking place. Only the next morning, a Japanese four-funnel cruiser and a small aircraft carrier, as well as two auxiliary ships, arrived nearby. It is reported that the Hanner's passengers have jointly signed a letter expressing their gratitude to the captain for his efforts to get them ashore at Gu'aotou. After the Hanner returned to Shanghai this morning, the captain immediately reported to the German consulate. A German consulate official told reporters that he was awaiting a written report on the matter in order to study it carefully and take action if necessary. According to the German captain's report, the Japanese warship fired at least one shot at the Hanner "to warn" it. The official added that the Japanese authorities' move may have been due to "military needs."</p>

Over the past year, significant progress has been made, with a total of more than 138,000 yuan raised in donations. All of these funds have been transferred to the Refugee Relief Association to cover refugee relief expenses. The refugees in the city have greatly benefited from this effort. It is now understood that, given the recent lack of enthusiastic donation sources, the committee has announced its conclusion on the 29th to reduce procedures. All seals, documents, etc., have been inventoried and handed over to the association. All pledge books previously issued but not yet returned to the committee are also rendered invalid as of that date. Going forward, all external donations should still be sent to the Refugee Relief Association for unified management.</p>

<p>Gu Huanzhang, a native of this county, 38 years old, runs the Gongyi Leather Factory at 1097 Kangnai Road and the Hengxiang Leather Store at 85 Beihai Road. Due to thriving business, Gu has accumulated considerable wealth. On January 1, 1931, through a matchmaker, he married Ye Peiyu (currently 27 years old), daughter of the famous Zhenhai physician Ye Peilin, at the China Hotel. They have two sons and one daughter, the eldest son being ten years old. Ye is quite attractive. However, in January of the previous year, Gu, having grown complacent with his wealth, began an affair with a Suzhou woman, Ding Yanqin (currently only 19 years old). Because Ding is an educated woman, Gu feared she would not be content as a concubine, so he lied and said he was not yet married. They initially cohabited at 14 Kangbao Lane, Beijing Road, and now reside on the second floor of 1294 Aiduya Road (i.e., Junle Village). However, Ye was unaware of this. Whenever Gu stayed overnight at Ding's place, he always excused himself by saying he was playing mahjong all night with friends at an inn. Ye, thinking her husband was socializing with friends, considered it normal and was not suspicious. Recently, in May of this year, Gu was kidnapped and ransomed for a large sum of money. Since then, Gu's attitude towards Ye suddenly changed, frequently becoming violent. Ye became suspicious and, after private investigation, learned that Gu was having an affair. She then reported this to the Chengdu Road Police Station, requesting assistance. After investigation, Chinese Detective Sun Wenxi confirmed the information and requested a search warrant from the First Special District Court. At 3:00 AM on the 21st of this month, they rushed to 1294 Aiduya Road and arrested Gu and Ding, taking them back to the police station. Because Gu has a fixed residence, he was not detained. A summons was issued to the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo opened a criminal court for interrogation. Ding Yanqin claimed illness and did not attend, sending lawyer Yao to court to request a postponement. Gu arrived with lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang. Gu's wife, Ye Peiyu, also hired lawyer Sun Zuji to file a related civil suit, requesting one million yuan in emotional distress compensation. Police lawyer Peng Qiqi stated the facts, prosecuting Gu on charges of adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. Questioned by the court, Gu claimed that his cohabitation with Ding was with Ye's consent, and that he was allowed to stay at Ding's place once a week. He even claimed that the cohabitation agreement with Ding was stolen by Ye. The court asked whether Ding knew that Gu was married. He replied, "I told Ding that I was not yet married." The court asked whether Ding and Ye had ever met or interacted. He replied, "They have never met." The court then asked Ye about Gu's claims. According to her testimony, "The defendant already has children, so there is no need to take a concubine. As for the claim that he married Ding with my consent, where is the evidence? Every woman is inevitably narrow-minded; how could I consent to my husband taking a concubine? As for the so-called cohabitation agreement, which he claims I stole and hid, that is even more ridiculous. That kind of agreement is a valuable item for both defendants, how could I obtain it, and what use would it be to me? What I would want to keep is my marriage certificate with Gu." After reviewing the testimonies, the court, noting that Ding Yanqin claimed illness and did not attend, ordered a postponement of the hearing. It also informed her representative lawyer that he must comply with the summons for the next hearing.</p>

He recently learned that Jin Tai had 198 pieces of brown paper, worth 3,900 yuan, for sale, which would be shipped out by a customer. Li then forged a warehouse receipt and presented it to the warehouse to claim the goods. Chang, an employee of the warehouse, unable to distinguish the authenticity of the receipt, handed the goods over to Li. Li then tried to sell the paper to the Quan Ji Yong Paper Store. After the transaction, he brought the truck to the Quan Ji Yong warehouse at 18 Shunfu Lane, Beidi Road. It was discovered that the paper was from Jin Tai, and Quan Ji Yong inquired about the matter by telephone. The case was then exposed. Jin Tai reported this to the Xinzha Police Station. Chinese Detective Ma Derong arrested Li. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan prosecuted him according to law. After questioning by Judge Liu, Li was ordered to be detained for a further seven days of interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Securities: Four Years of Resistance War; Domestic Debt Credit Steps Up; Thirty to Forty Yuan: Forty to Fifty Yuan: Fifty to Sixty Yuan <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The over-the-counter securities market surged even more strongly yesterday. Major investors re-emerged to snap up stocks, further depleting the supply on the trading floor. The major buyers of the day were systematically accumulating stocks, and their continuous purchasing suggests a specific purpose. The likely reason is the decreasing interest rates and the increasing availability of idle funds, which are driving investment towards government bonds. Market rumors suggest that the debt market will continue to rise in price, mirroring the trend seen during the initial years of the war: from twenty to forty yuan in the first year, to forty to fifty yuan in the second year, and fifty yuan and above in the third year. Now, in the fourth year of the war, a continued increase in market prices is inevitable. This demonstrates the increasing strength of the resistance war and can enhance international credit. Further leaps in progress are possible. At the opening yesterday morning, the market weakened, continuing the sluggishness of the previous afternoon. Nos. 16 and Xinfu took advantage of the low prices to absorb stocks. Wanchun, Xinchang, Lianhe, and Tiansheng also supported prices. Domestic bonds briefly exceeded the two-yuan mark. Shunchang, Tongxing, and Tianfeng saw supply from retail investors, but prices remained very firm. Later, Tongkang bought aggressively, and Xinfu and No. 16 continued to purchase steadily. Dahua focused on purchasing Class B bonds, and Xinchang also bought significantly. Hongkang, Runyi, Yichang, and Jiufeng sold quite a bit. Hengfu sold more than it bought, but the market continued to rise. By the end of the day, prices had risen by 0.30 to 0.70 yuan, with a total trading volume of over 1.4 million. A simplified table is provided below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of Sanyou Industrial Company were traded at a price of 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market at the Public Industry Association opened extremely strong yesterday, with the prices of various stocks rising rapidly. Suddenly, rumors emerged that the Japanese might take action against Vietnam. Although this rumor was unconfirmed, the market was immediately affected, and a wave of selling began. Those with financial strength recognized the opportunity and began purchasing stocks. However, there were few cheap stocks available. As a result of the buying frenzy, the market rose again at the close.</p>
<p>London, 29th (Thursday) - The listed prices of Chinese foreign debt and British Far Eastern Company stocks remained unchanged today, with only bank stocks showing slight improvement. HSBC British and Hong Kong Registered shares rose by one pound to six pounds and thirty shillings. Hong Kong Registered shares also rose by half a pound to sixty-eight pounds and ten shillings. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Finance: Foreign Exchange Enters a Hovering State <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in HSBC's listed rates. The over-the-counter market for British and American currencies experienced slower fluctuations and entered a hovering state. There were no new stimuli to excite the public, so speculators were indecisive, entering and exiting the market without a clear direction. However, most who were bullish remained patient, waiting for an opportunity to increase their positions. Although American banks were eager to supply currency and speculators were selling, these offers were absorbed. The American exchange rate briefly reached a high of 5.40625 yuan, but it ultimately eased by the close of the morning session. The market hardened again initially, but speculators emerged to take profits, stabilizing the situation. Ultimately, the British gold exchange rate remained unchanged at 3 shillings and 5.9375 pence, while the American exchange rate eased by 0.03125 yuan to 5.375 yuan. The gap between futures and spot rates gradually narrowed.</p>
<p>Speculative Activity Uneven</p>
<p>In the morning, the London big bars rose by 0.0625 for near-term contracts and 0.25 for long-term contracts. New York silver prices remained stable. London gold prices were fixed. The British exchange rate was unchanged against the US dollar and Shanghai. The American exchange rate rose by 0.35 against the British pound, by 0.06 against Shanghai, and had no market against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3 shillings and 5.5625 pence for the British gold exchange rate and 5.34375 yuan for the American exchange rate, reflecting a tightening of 0.03125 yuan for the British rate and no change for the American rate compared to the previous day's close. The market remained calm after opening. HSBC offered American currency at 3 shillings and 5.625 pence, and soon after, American banks sold spot American currency to foreign banks at 5.375 yuan. Chinese speculators bought American currency for the current month at 5.375 yuan. At this time, the American exchange rate reached a high of 5.406 yuan. HSBC's listed rates were unchanged. The white silver balance tax increased by 0.50%. Subsequently, speculative activity increased, leading to a gradual easing of prices. Speculators sold American currency for the current month to foreign banks, driving the price from 5.375 yuan down to 5.3125 yuan. Due to a lack of sellers, the tightening trend peaked around 11:00 AM. American banks also sold American currency for September to Chinese speculators at 5.3125 yuan. There were no significant changes at the close of the morning session, with a slight easing in prices. The British gold exchange rate closed at 3 shillings and 5.578125 pence, and the American exchange rate closed at 5.375 yuan, showing a gain of 0.015625 yuan for the British rate and a gain of 0.0325 yuan for the American rate compared to the opening rates.</p>
<p>Weak Afternoon Demand</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the market eased further as speculators reversed course and began selling, and demand remained weak. American banks initially bought September American currency from speculators at 5.375 yuan. At that time, the spot price of British gold eased to 3 shillings and 5.59375 pence. However, speculators re-emerged to cover their positions in September American currency, causing prices to recover slightly. The Eastern Asia Bank bought September American currency at 5.34375 yuan. The closing rates were 3 shillings and 5.59375 pence for British gold and 5.375 yuan for American currency, with September British gold at 3 shillings and 5.578125 pence and September American currency at 5.34375 yuan. Compared to the previous day, British gold spot and futures were unchanged, and American currency rates were all higher by 0.03215 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong American Exchange Rate Continues to Tighten</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 30th (Friday) - The foreign exchange market opened stable this morning. Both spot and futures rates for the British exchange rate were unchanged. The spot rate for the American exchange rate tightened by 0.0625 to 22.5 yuan. The spot rate for the Shanghai exchange rate rose by 0.50 yuan to 115 yuan. The spot rate for the Japanese exchange rate fell by 0.50 yuan to 95.5 yuan. At 9:30 AM, the spot rate for the Shanghai exchange rate continued to rise by 1 yuan to 116 yuan. At 11:30 AM, the market stabilized. The spot rate for the American exchange rate continued to tighten by 0.0625 to 22.41275 yuan. The spot rate for the Shanghai exchange rate fell by 2 yuan to 414 yuan. The rest remained unchanged. The market closed stable in the afternoon. The spot rate for the Shanghai exchange rate rose by 1 yuan to 115 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened stable at 2:30 PM. All exchange rates were unchanged.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rates Also Contract</p>
<p>Tianjin, 30th (Friday) - The foreign exchange market opened stable this morning. Spot rates for British and American currencies each tightened by 0.03125. The spot rate for the British exchange rate was 3 shillings and 3.125 pence, and the spot rate for the American exchange rate was 5.03125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate fell by 0.50 yuan to 108 yuan. The over-the-counter rate for "Allied Currency" rose by 0.25 yuan to 92.65 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Gold Market Lingers; Lacks Power to Rise; Highest Rate Seen at 6,125 Yuan <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's over-the-counter gold market lacked the power to rise and ultimately fell slightly. Although sentiment remained firm, general observations suggested that the market was lingering. Consequently, many bulls took profits at high prices. With the Shanghai market being stable, it was easier for prices to fall than to rise. The opening price was 6,000 yuan. Subsequently, the Jin Hao Qian Dui firm aggressively absorbed gold, driving prices up to 6,115 yuan. The Yinhang gold sellers re-emerged, and despite the Jin Hao Qian Dui firm's relentless efforts to purchase gold, the imbalance in supply and demand caused prices to fall back to 6,020 yuan. The morning session closed with the Qian Dui firm pushing prices back up to 6,035 yuan. The Shanghai market was stable, and initial conditions were quite good. However, a slight offering by the Qian Dui firm caused prices to drop by several dozen yuan. Later, securities firms began to purchase gold, driving prices as high as 6,080 yuan. Ultimately, continued selling by the Yinhang firms pushed prices down again to 6,020 yuan. The closing price was only 6,035 yuan, a slight decline of 10 yuan from the previous day. Trading volume remained strong throughout the day, with over 3,000 taels traded. Silver jewelry remained unchanged, and customs gold prices also remained stable.</p>
<p>The Pure Gold Crushed and Fell by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>Since morning (each bar weighing 10 taels), the pure gold market initially weakened due to a hardening in the foreign exchange market. The opening price was immediately lowered by 45 yuan. The Yinhang offered 20 taels to the Jin Hao firm at a price of 6,000 yuan. As there were still many sellers, prices continued to fall by 20 yuan, reaching a low of 5,980 yuan. However, trading volume was very low. Subsequently, the foreign exchange market tightened, and the Jin Hao firm, Qian Dui firm, and others aggressively absorbed gold. Before long, prices soared by 145 yuan, reaching a high of 6,125 yuan. However, at that time, some Yinhang firms began to take profits, causing prices to fall back to 6,095 yuan. Ultimately, the Qian Dui firm and the Jin Hao firm repurchased gold, driving prices back up to 6,120 yuan. After that, some Yinhang firms showed a tendency to exit the market, and at the same time, the tightening of the foreign exchange market eased slightly, leading to new sellers entering the market. The market weakened considerably, falling back to 6,020 yuan. Later, some Jin Hao firms stopped selling, and the Qian Dui firm increased its purchases at a low price, pushing prices up by another 45 yuan. However, the closing price still retreated to 6,035 yuan. The opening price was raised by 25 yuan, with the Yinhang purchasing 10 taels from the silver jewelry industry at 6,060 yuan. Later, the Qian Dui firm sold gold, causing prices to fall by 15 yuan. Securities firms offered 10 taels to the Yinhang at 6,045 yuan. Soon after, securities firms stopped selling and aggressively purchased gold, driving prices up to 6,080 yuan. As buyers decreased, prices gradually declined, falling by several yuan. Soon after, gold firms sold gold, causing floating profits to be closed out. Although the Qian Dui firm took in gold, its head position ultimately felt crowded. Before the close, prices had retreated to 6,020 yuan. Fortunately, Yinhang firms slightly repurchased gold, so the closing price was still 6,035 yuan. As a result, prices fell by only 10 yuan compared to the previous day, with a daily range of 145 yuan. The selling price of spot gold at the current Jin Hao firm's main brand was several dozen yuan higher than the pure gold price, and the purchasing price was reduced by 30 yuan. The current standard gold price was over 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of silver jewelry remained unchanged throughout the day. Datong Hang still held at 620 yuan per tael. The new Datong Hang's prices were similar to those of the previous day, with a purchase price reduction of around 30 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e101">The Japanese Yen's Rise is Startling; British Gold Bills Still Being Traded <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market saw gold prices linger and slightly ease, with both British and American gold pounds each decreasing by 0.50 yuan. British gold bills were still being traded, and the market price ultimately rose by 0.50 yuan. The prices of American gold bills fluctuated, and the market ultimately fell by 0.10 yuan. Demand for Hong Kong bills remained strong, and the market price continued to rise. The rise in Japanese gold bills was startling. The evening price rose to 1.75 yuan, a sharp increase of 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day. The reason for the continued rise in these bills is said to be due to the high demand from Japanese individuals, who are reportedly taking them back to their country. However, the amount of these bills circulating in the local market is not very large, so once they are bought up, prices rise sharply. Korean bills followed suit, rising to 1.72 yuan in the evening market.</p>
<h3 id="e102">How to Identify Counterfeit Banknotes? <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>How to identify counterfeit banknotes is a piece of common knowledge that every "counter clerk" urgently wants to know.</p>
<p>In fact, banknotes that are not valid for circulation are not limited to "fake" ones. Other counterfeit banknotes, such as altered banknotes and banknotes with inserted strips, are also prohibited from circulation. I will now briefly describe their types and identification methods:</p>
<p>Counterfeit Banknotes: These are the most commonly found banknotes in the market. Some are printed well, and others are printed poorly. Poorly printed banknotes are naturally easy to identify. Well-printed banknotes, however, can be almost indistinguishable from real ones, making it difficult to identify them. However, if you examine them carefully, you can eventually see the flaws. No matter how well a counterfeit banknote is printed, its patterns will be coarser than those of a real banknote when compared. Also, most real banknotes have watermarks, while counterfeit banknotes do not. Therefore, "careful examination" is the only way to identify counterfeit banknotes.</p>
<p>Altered Banknotes: An altered banknote is a real banknote that has been changed. For example, a one-yuan banknote is changed to a five-yuan banknote, or a five-yuan banknote has its denomination changed to ten yuan. To identify them, you must memorize the color patterns of banknotes issued by various banks. When you encounter such an altered banknote, you can identify it by its color pattern. For example, the five-yuan banknotes issued by the Central Bank in the 25th year of the Republic have green patterns on all four sides, and the pattern above the denomination is slightly square. The ten-yuan banknotes issued by the same bank in the same year have dark green patterns on all four sides, and the pattern above the denomination is slightly oval. If you memorize these patterns, you will be able to identify the five-yuan altered to ten-yuan counterfeit banknotes issued by this bank by their patterns. Naturally, no matter how clever the means of alteration, there will always be some traces of alteration that cannot be completely concealed in the area where the denomination is changed. However, it is difficult for people who do not often handle banknotes to notice these traces.</p>
<p>Banknotes with Inserted Strips: A banknote that has been used for a long time and passed through many hands is inevitably damaged. Therefore, it is common practice to patch a banknote in areas that do not obstruct the main images and colors so that it can continue to be used. However, we must not take this as a common practice and overlook it, because many of these patched banknotes are actually counterfeit banknotes with inserted strips. If you carelessly accept such a banknote, it will become worthless. These banknotes are made by removing a strip from a real banknote and replacing it with a strip from a counterfeit banknote. The removed strip from the real banknote can then be combined with other strips to make a whole banknote for use. Therefore, to identify these counterfeit banknotes, you only need to carefully examine the patched area, and it will not be difficult to see the flaws.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are many other types of banknotes that are not valid for circulation. For example, banknotes that are only valid for circulation in one province cannot be used in other provinces. These banknotes have the area of validity printed on them and are easy to identify. Also, banknotes with incomplete serial numbers or different serial numbers on each side are not valid for circulation.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be added that counterfeit banknotes are not limited to yuan denominations. There are also many counterfeit banknotes among the jiao denominations. Recently, counterfeit versions of the five-fen denomination banknotes issued by the Central Bank have appeared on the market. We must not ignore them because of their small value.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: How to identify genuine banknotes is indeed something that everyone wants to know. Although I am not a member of the business community and have not handled many banknotes in my life, my desire for knowledge is no less than that of our readers. Based on my usual observations, the paper, patterns, and printing of genuine banknotes are generally exquisite. When you touch them with your fingers, the paper is smooth and fine, and the patterns are clearly raised. When you look at them with your eyes, the colors are bright, and even if they are old, the patterns are clear and detailed. Most of these are genuine banknotes. It is said that many banknotes have hidden marks before they are watermarked, but they are unwilling to reveal them, fearing that counterfeiters could imitate them if they are made public, rendering them ineffective. Therefore, only the bank itself or related money-handling businesses know them, and the interests of banknote users are disregarded. It is also said that counterfeiters do not want to make their banknotes too realistic and often deliberately leave flaws in them, so that if they are caught in the future, they can argue that users were careless, thereby mitigating their punishment. Is this true? We should ask people in the money-handling business about this.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for foreign rice was even more brisk. Although the Evaluation Committee strictly enforced restrictions according to the highest price limit and issued a public notice saying, "Considering the abundant stock in warehouses, all of us in the business must comply with the evaluation for transactions. Any deliberate violations, once reported, will be severely punished by the two municipal councils," the open market prices all followed the high prices evaluated and opened in recent days. However, very few high-quality goods were displayed as samples, and medium-low quality rice was used as substitutes. The market price had already secretly risen by one to one and a half yuan. Original packages from English and Chinese firms were eagerly bought and sold, indicating lively transactions. It is said that cargo owners considered the goods to be rare and valuable, while hoarders tried their best to absorb them. Moreover, with unrestricted evaluations, the initial price of No. 2 Border rice opened at sixty-six yuan and three jiao, followed by sixty-seven yuan, sixty-eight yuan and seven jiao, and a maximum of sixty-nine yuan and a half, which was two and a half yuan higher than the previous day. The initial price of No. 2 Saigon rice opened at sixty-eight yuan, already one yuan higher, and then was shouted up to sixty-nine yuan and a half and seventy yuan and five jiao. Although no deals were finalized, the trend was already evident. Saigon broken rice opened at fifty-three yuan and eight jiao to fifty-four yuan and eight jiao. Little milled rice initially opened at sixty-seven yuan, but few buyers were found. Subsequently, at sixty-seven yuan and six jiao, there were still no sales. Siamese tea rice opened at fifty-eight yuan and a half, generally two, three, or five yuan higher than previous prices. In total, there were already more than 700 tons on the market, with 13,000 bags being traded.</p>
<p>The arrival of glutinous rice was small, but sales were brisk, also increasing by half a yuan. Jinli special grade was sixty-four yuan and a half, sixty-four yuan. Changdan was sixty-two or three yuan, Hong Kong special grade was sixty-four or five yuan, and ordinary was sixty-two or three yuan.</p>
<p>Although the supply of thick and thin粳and other domestic rice continued, there were still only six or seven hundred bags. Rumors outside the market followed the surge in foreign rice, continuing to increase by one yuan. Changbang fresh Qing粳 has already broken through the seventy-yuan mark, opening at seventy-one or two yuan. Changsu Kun粳was sixty-eight or nine yuan, followed by sixty-five yuan. Nangang original packaged early rice was sixty-seven yuan or sixty-six yuan and a half, with bulk seen at sixty-four yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 35 dan of Zhoupu new粳arrived, and the sales market, having been out of stock for several days, urgently needed it. Under the mutual competition of general merchants, it was quickly sold out. Therefore, the market was unusually firm and brisk, opening at sixty-four yuan and seven jiao, sixty-four yuan and a half, an increase of one or two yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, with 1,217 bags brought by the Taikoo Company's Zhejiang轮from Hong Kong, and unloaded at the company's own wharf in Pudong.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Hoarding by Speculators, Forward Purchases of Japanese Flour <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the market for Japanese flour was weak in the near term but brisk in the long term. This was because spot goods had been actually slow to sell recently, with domestic and foreign flour flooding the market, making it difficult for people to be optimistic. However, the long-term situation was stimulated by the narrowing of the gold and foreign exchange rates, and there were quite a few speculators inquiring about prices. Therefore, September's Phoenix brand rose from fourteen yuan and seven jiao and a half to eight jiao and a half, and October's rose from fourteen yuan and nine jiao to fifteen yuan and three fen, with 7,500 bags traded. Spot goods remained at fourteen yuan and five jiao, with only sporadic purchases by local customers. As for the prices of Chinese flour mills, there had been no changes for a long time. The Fufu mills released three to four thousand bags.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat trading remained quiet. This was because few domestic goods had arrived recently, and two ships of foreign wheat had arrived, with three more ships expected to arrive in early next month. However, it had become difficult to calculate international prices, so people's minds gradually became stable, and merchants intended to raise prices. However, Japanese mills had unusually harsh purchasing conditions, and Chinese mills had difficulties in shipping, making it difficult to expand demand. Only the Sanxin mill received two to three thousand bags per day, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Miscellaneous Grains, New Sesame Seeds Continue to Arrive <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>New sesame seeds: The first batch of Yangzhou goods, consisting of eight bags, arrived on the market the day before yesterday, with a price of forty-two yuan. The harvest this year is good, and the color is also good, with dirt and ash at around 10%. Yesterday, another ten bags arrived, with a slightly worse color, and the price fell by two yuan compared to the first batch, to forty yuan. It was still handled by Mujie. Currently, the supply of miscellaneous grains is restricted, so the arrival of goods is mostly small and sporadic. Yesterday, it was reported that more than two hundred bags of new Changzhou cowhide green beans had arrived. The selling price of domestic beans was tight and had already been secretly raised. Yesterday, there were export merchants from this street inquiring about yellow beans in the sales market. Therefore, under the potential situation of unequal supply and demand, the price was tightly raised by three or four jiao, with more than seven hundred bags of Anqing beans traded, priced at thirty-one yuan and five jiao to thirty-two yuan. Three hundred bags of Pudong Zhongdu beans were priced at twenty-nine yuan and eight jiao and five fen. Four hundred bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were priced at twenty-eight yuan and four jiao to twenty-nine yuan, it is said. Today, two hundred bags of beans and one thousand pieces of bean cake will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Yarn and Cotton, Sales are Made When Prices are High, Yarn Prices are in a Saw-like Pattern, Hovering Around the Thousand Yuan Mark <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market opened higher, then immediately fell back, with the situation still hovering at high levels, quite like a tug-of-war. The general discussion among speculators in the market is that with the rise in gold and the shrinking of exchange rates, the yarn market should be seen as rising, and it would not be surprising if it rose above the thousand-yuan mark. However, it has been hovering around 970-980 yuan for a long time. Another saying is that the stock of yarn is increasing daily, and the sales channels for yarn are very narrow, so although speculators are trying their best to raise prices, the chips are still flooding the market.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning with a fierce momentum, because the sentiment was strong in the afternoon of the previous day, and the buying trend was even stronger. The price of 20-count Bianma was 986 yuan, but as soon as the price opened, the bulls came to sell in large quantities, and the atmosphere on the trading floor felt relaxed. At the same time, the foreign exchange rate rose slightly, and the sentiment weakened, quickly falling to 965 yuan. Afterwards, the US exchange rate changed and contracted, and the market image tightened to 977 yuan. Ultimately, due to poor actual digestion and the urgency in Vietnam, it fell back to 967 yuan at the close. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,785 packages were traded. The price of 20-count Double Horse fell by 2 yuan. Today, 110 pieces of cotton yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each trade is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Trade: 1,600 Domestic: 20</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 1615 Total: 2,785</p>
<h3 id="e107">New Cotton is Already Being Traded <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The spot cotton situation remains quiet. This is because the import figures for foreign cotton last month were very large, and the storage capacity of various factories is very slow, so the situation does not have much upward momentum. However, recently the quality of new is good. According to farmers in the surrounding villages, the cotton quality and husk percentage this year are better than last year, so is already actively purchasing new cotton, but the demand from Chinese factories has not been developed, mainly due to the abundance of cotton.</p>

<p>In other news, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, was quite quiet in the morning. Initially, there was a lack of sellers, and later, due to the firmness of stock prices on Wall Street and the hedging by some short sellers, the closing price was one or three points higher than the previous day. The Indian market situation was quiet. Yesterday, including forecasts, it rose by half a rupee.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai was quite deserted. Both parties held expectations, but the long stock in the market was extremely meager. The factory side still believed that new cotton would soon enter the market, and the cotton price could be reduced. Whether the new cotton will be transported and how the new cotton can be cheap are all problems.</p>

<p>During the Three Dynasties, rites and music flourished. The Xia and Shang had their own creations, and the Zhou Dynasty had the most comprehensive system. Therefore, books on rites and music were most prevalent during the Zhou Dynasty, which lasted the longest and had the most sages. Their writings were passed down, instructing future generations. The rites of the Second Dynasties were honored due to the evolution of ancestral temples and the textual research of Confucian scholars, which were compiled into written form. Except for those that specified the rites of the Xia and Shang Dynasties, all were Zhou institutions. It can be said to be very complex! After the torches of Qin and Chu, nothing remained. During the reigns of Emperor Wen, Wu, Jing, and Xuan, they gradually reappeared. However, after being tampered with by later Confucian scholars and pieced together by superficial people, they were no longer the original texts of the Zhou Dynasty. Throughout the Han Dynasty, Confucian scholars gathered to argue, considering it the essence of learning. However, few people in the court and among the common people could practice them. From then on, people no longer spoke of ancient rites. The Ming Dynasty valued the eight-legged essay. Even the scholars and officials did not know the punctuation of the classics of rites. This trend continued into our dynasty. Although talents emerged, the scholars of eight-legged essays inherited the old habits of the Ming Dynasty, even more so. To the point that when they see four people making music and dancing, they all think it is the sound of a foreign land and do not bother to look at it. Alas! How can they know that what remains of the ancient sounds and rhythms can now be seen in Western music, which still has a similar appearance to the sounds and appearances of the Three Dynasties. Chinese music and dance were practiced in the Three Dynasties and flourished in the Zhou Dynasty, ending in the Spring and Autumn period. This was because the feudal system was abolished and the well-field system was not implemented. If the well-field system is not implemented, then the drinking and archery ceremony is not learned in the countryside. Therefore, the people do not know music, how can they see music and dance? Tracing the reason for this, it has been the case since the Qin Dynasty. This is due to the destiny of the times, not entirely related to human affairs.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Feelings on Funerals <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Hangke</p>
<p>This article describes Gorky's funeral. It is said that on the day of Gorky's death, mourning flags with black borders on red backgrounds were hung all over Moscow. Bookstores displayed Gorky's works, books, portraits, and bronze statues. Theaters suspended performances, parks closed their doors, and Chopin's Funeral March was broadcast on the radio. The next day's newspapers were filled with eulogies and obituaries. Tens of thousands of people lined the streets to pay their respects, and important figures such as Stalin and Molotov stood beside Gorky's body as honorary guards. To receive such honor after death, even for an essential figure, is indeed enviable. However, we must not forget that Gorky did not receive such honor as a mere literary figure. In the eyes of Stalin and the entire Soviet population, Gorky was practically a founder of a socialist country, on par with Lenin.</p>
<p>Some people, seeing that Chinese literary figures often die in obscurity and witnessing the Russian government's great affection for Gorky, angrily say, "Chinese writers have no prospects; the government simply undervalues the power of literary figures!" In reality, it is not that the government undervalues literary figures, but that the literary figures themselves cannot produce works suitable for the times and the needs of the people. The writers of rhyming prose in the Han Dynasty, the essayists of the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties, the poets, novelists, and prose writers of the Tang Dynasty, the lyricists of the Song Dynasty, and the playwrights of the Yuan Dynasty were slaves before emperors and aristocrats, and strangers to the common people. In short, they merely used their writings as playthings! After the Republic of China, despite years of literary revolution, writers and the common people remained strangers. It is evident that it is the people who undervalue literary figures, not the government, and only by winning the favor of the people can writers be truly valued. Dostoevsky was not valued by the old Russian authorities, but after his death, hundreds of thousands of working people automatically attended his funeral, completing a solemn ceremony no less grand than Gorky's.</p>
<p>A great era has arrived in China! The Sino-Japanese War, like the October Revolution, can create many Gorkys. If Chinese writers wish to receive Gorky's honor after death, they must transform themselves into Gorkys in the War of Resistance. Otherwise, the people will remain indifferent to you.</p>

<p>— Lini</p>
<p>Why do we labor? For money?</p>
<p>You may possess tens of millions of dollars, but surely, your money cannot be kept forever. Eventually, it will inevitably be completely depleted.</p>
<p>Then, do we labor for power?</p>
<p>The name of the first great emperor in the world has long been forgotten. And other figures of power whom we admired have also vanished like flowing water. How many powerful people can stand beside Niagara Falls without trembling in fear? How many people's power can compare to the force of wind and waves? The power granted to oneself by mankind is nothing but foolishly and temporarily satisfying personal desires!</p>
<p>However, what is most valuable? Let us look at the great figures of the past and present who are worthy of people's admiration. Let us just name a few examples: Columbus, Michelangelo, Guttenberg, Shakespeare, Galileo, Fulton, Watt, Hargreaves—</p>
<p>Each of them has a noteworthy history; they all worked diligently for the benefit of others.</p>
<p>Hargreaves, a clothier, invented the spinning jenny, enabling millions of people to have comfortable clothing. Galileo improved the telescope, allowing people to explore the magnificence of space. Wilberforce helped people restore their conscience; he freed millions of slaves. Columbus gave a great nation a good homeland. Michelangelo and Shakespeare stirred people's talents, inspiring them to devote themselves to new endeavors, feeding people's spiritual hunger—a truly more important task than filling their stomachs! We sit in steamboats invented by Fulton and are propelled forward by engines invented by Watt.</p>
<p>The greatest people often strive for the welfare of later generations; what Jesus earnestly exhorted the world to do was simply to love one another.</p>
<p>You may have money, you may have power, but if you want to stand out even slightly from the millions of people who are born and die without a trace, what is the use of your money and power?</p>
<p>If you are one of the millions who have neither wealth nor power, there is still much you can do: you can carry heavy objects for the elderly, you can encourage a pitiful evildoer to repent and start anew, you can set a good example for children, and you can urge workers to work honestly to seek their own happiness.</p>
<p>The era when killing ten adults was considered more important than raising a thousand children has long passed. Now, we must help people make good use of their millions to benefit the world.</p>
<p>You should strive now to do your best for the happiness of the masses; it is better to be a pioneer who goes astray.</p>

<p>— Zhixuan</p>
<p>Many people, with boastful and envious tones, recount story after story. Someone who has been doing business for nearly twenty or thirty years has only made twenty or thirty thousand in the last two years. Someone else, not yet twenty years old, probably earns a thousand or so a month now.</p>
<p>Yet another person, riding this year's trend, has also earned ten thousand or so.</p>
<p>I can't remember all the different people and events. As I listen, I feel amazed by all these words, but they all revolve around the same goal. I want to thank the many hearts that encourage and urge me on. But I feel as if I am in a desert, experiencing boundless loneliness.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Case</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Ballerina's Ending <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter Six: A Dangerous Experience</p>
<p>At this moment, there was a gentle knock on the office door. Then, without waiting for Ni Jinshou's response, the door was pushed open, and a person in a navy blue suit and a black felt hat walked in. The person wore wide-rimmed dark glasses and had a short black mustache. He stood straight after entering the door without even removing his hat.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou stood up, propped himself on the desk with both hands, and asked the visitor, "Who is it? What's the matter?"</p>
<p>The person remained stiff and did not answer. I felt something was amiss. This was a government office; how could this person just barge in? Once my attention was focused, I couldn't help but exclaim,</p>
<p>"Hawthorne!"</p>
<p>It was indeed Hawthorne, but after carefully examining his left and right cheeks, I saw no scars. Ni Jinshou was stunned for a moment. Hawthorne removed his black hat and dark glasses, and spoke in a seemingly annoyed tone.</p>
<p>"Ah, I'm too timid! When people get older, they tend to be more cautious than young people. But sometimes, my caution is my downfall!"</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou smiled and said, "Mr. Hawthorne, what do you mean by that? I can't make heads or tails of it—your disguise is really good."</p>
<p>Hawthorne lightly peeled off the fake mustache stuck to his lip. "Good? But Bao Lang saw through it. This doesn't even count as a disguise; it's just a temporary emergency measure."</p>
<p>Yu Gantang suddenly straightened up in his chair. His eyes darted back and forth between Hawthorne's and my faces. Hawthorne also noticed the young man.</p>
<p>He pointed at the young man and asked Ni Jinshou, "Who is this?" His tone was casual, clearly pretending not to recognize him.</p>
<p>Ni Jinshou replied, "Yu Gantang—a brilliant student from Jiangnan University."</p>
<p>Hawthorne turned his head and solemnly bowed to the young man. "Ah, forgive me! Mr. Yu, you are an educated youth of the times, an intellectual, a leader of the future society. I truly apologize!" He bowed respectfully, paused, and continued, "It's a pity that you've come here; it may delay your studies."</p>

<p>— Mingxun</p>
<p>How many things in life are delayed by the future?</p>
<p>Generally, when people do something and fail, they not only don't persevere but instead say, "My wings are not yet fully fledged; I'll try again in the future." In reality, when will one's wings ever be considered fully fledged? How many futures does one have in life?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Mourning the past is futile; longing for the future is unreliable." Therefore, the most precious thing in life is to seize the present.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Autumn is Not for Reading <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>"When a leaf falls, autumn arrives." The golden breeze brings coolness, and the summer heat completely dissipates, making it the most suitable time for reading. However, with the high price of books, I am unable to afford them, so I can only "sigh at the sight of books," wasting this excellent environment. It truly is a case of "autumn is not for reading"!</p>
<p>But on the other hand, there are places where you can buy valuable books for a small amount of money, and Qiming Book Company is one example. The "World Literature Masterpieces" they publish include over two hundred titles, all famous works with fluent translations, sold at low prices. For example, "Immensee" is sold for only sixteen cents, and Turgenev's "First Love" is only twenty-odd cents, truly worthy of being hailed as the only spiritual food for the masses.</p>
<p>They also publish an English Self-Study Series, completely edited according to the needs of self-study, from simple to complex, worth browsing. Grammar, readers, conversation, calligraphy, letters, dictionaries, and other tools are all available.</p>
<p>A detailed catalog can be obtained from Qiming Book Company at No. 5, Lane 328, Fourth Road, telephone 95967. Major bookstores are also retailers.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Character Sketches from "Small Town Stories" <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Yuxiao</p>
<p>"Small Town Stories" was written by Yuan Jun. Considering the name "Jun," one might guess who the writer is. In any case, he is probably also a drama expert who studied in the United States, like director Zuo Lin (also known as Huang Zuolin, as mentioned in this publication a few days ago). The writer is quite self-assured, and the comedy is indeed well-written, especially the final fifth act. As for the plot, let me keep you in suspense; you will know as soon as you see it. Here, I will only introduce a few of the characters he portrays:</p>
<p>Mrs. Lang Si (Fourth Master Lang's Wife) - Played by Murong Wan'er. Wearing a pair of hoop earrings, she shakes her head constantly while speaking, which is extremely charming. This is not an easy feat, like Lao Chubiao in Peking opera, stroking his beard. The writer or director added a bit of character, making it difficult for Wan'er. I'm worried that after a few days of performing, her neck will be sore.</p>
<p>Master Lang Si (Fourth Master Lang) - Played by Han Fei. A large patch of his forehead is bald. The little bald man has suddenly become an old bald man. He wears an antique waistcoat. Most wonderfully, his teeth also appear to have been made up to look as if several are missing. When he speaks, his chin stretches out, and when he walks, he sways back and forth, which is very amusing. He is an expert at being afraid of his wife and obeying her every command.</p>
<p>Lao Xu - Played by Wei Zheng. He loves to eavesdrop. Every time he eavesdrops, his face leans against the door. When someone pushes the door open, his face gets a bruise. It is said that when he got married himself, he couldn't change his nature and actually went outside the window to eavesdrop on the bridal chamber, forgetting that the bridal chamber was his own.</p>
<p>Da Xue - Played by Han. A miser and an expert at eating for free, he has been staying at the Yang family's house for many days and has never given the servants a single penny. He would fight with rickshaw pullers over a few cents. It is said that when he was a child, he ate peanuts. If a peanut fell on the ground, he would stomp on it with his foot, afraid that someone else would snatch it from him.</p>
<p>Others, such as Yang Shengzu, played by Wu Bing, who sells fake antiques and tries to bargain an eighteen-dollar price for a broken three-dollar incense burner; his wife, Liu Yezi, played by Xia Xia, a romantic socialite who only wants to go to Shanghai; the extremely old-fashioned Mrs. Bei Er (Second Master Bei's Wife), played by Dai Yun, who walks with a twist; her husband, Master Bei Er, played by Mo Yan, who is full of bad ideas; the extremely stingy Master Qian Ba (Eighth Master Qian), played by Yan Jun, who is old and lecherous; and Wang Qi's Wang Ma (Mother Wang) and Zhi Jun's Xiao Bi (Little Bi), naturally adding to the atmosphere, are all typical characters.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Private Secretaries of Hollywood Stars <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>— Shawi</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Almost every movie actor with a prominent position in Hollywood has a private secretary. What is recorded below are the secretary situations of several major stars.</p>
<p>The first one to be mentioned is Iola Clark. Three months ago, Edward G. Robinson's friend heard that Robinson wanted a female secretary to assist him with his correspondence, and the friend thought of Miss Clark, who was looking for a job. The twenty-four-year-old Eran graduated from a higher education institution and also took business courses at the university. Later, she worked for a lead company and an insurance company. Now she has gradually become an experienced star secretary. She is also a capable housekeeper in the Robinson family. She gets along well with Mrs. Robinson and often helps her handle all the household affairs or take care of their children.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Zoe McKay also has a private secretary. The lady is actually the wife of Zoe's substitute, Earl, named Claire Andre. She has been with Zoe for three years. During these three years, she has been working for Zoe five and a half days a week in a specially set up small writing room in the Paramount Studio. Usually, she calls him Zoe, and Zoe also calls her by her name, so the two are as close as friends.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Walter Pick is a very handsome young man who is also Melvin Douglas's right-hand man. He graduated from Washington University a few years ago. Later, he met his cousin Mrs. Douglas in New York and followed them to Hollywood, where he became Melvin Douglas's secretary.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>When the suave young man on the screen, Tyrone Power, was still working with female playwright Kathleen Connor on the New York stage, he met a young man named Bill Gallagher. Later, Ty in Hollywood remembered him and wrote to Bill to invite him over. Before deciding anything, Ty always likes to discuss it with Bill first, because Ty feels that Bill is a very trustworthy and intelligent person.</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Miss Peggy Gough has been working for Spencer Tracy for many years, but they are still very polite when they meet. She is now twenty-seven, but she looks like she is only eleven years old. Peggy was originally a student at the University of California. Since becoming Spencer's secretary, she has been answering his business and fan mail every day. She said that although her office is next door to the mysterious girl Garbo's dressing room (in the MGM studio), she has never met Garbo even once. This is probably why Garbo is so mysterious!</p>

<p>The Times Theater on Jiujiang Road and Daxin Street has been reorganized and is striving for innovation. It has spent a large amount of money to renovate the interior and exterior. Since its opening, business has been booming. Recently, it has again hired famous performers at a high price, including the champion female lead Xu Biyan, the male lead Tai ★ Meiying, and the female lead and flower-shirt actress Li Suqiu, all of whom have excellent acting skills and are extremely popular.

<p>— Zhiqian</p>
<p>The circus is a sensation in Shanghai again. In the impression of Shanghai people, there was only the Haikingbo Circus on Gordon Road and Dabiru Road seven years ago. Who knew that fifty years ago, there was a large circus led by a man named Zorini in an open space in Hongkou, which returned with great acclaim; that circus was also the forefather of Shanghai circus.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Shanghai Music Concert <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Mingshan</p>
<p>A year ago, the responsible persons of several major harmonica groups in Shanghai and I initiated the "Shanghai Harmonica Team Joint Concert" at the Huibinlou on Fourth Road. After the meeting, readers of "Chinese Harmonica Circle" and others suggested that our country urgently needs to establish a complete joint harmonica team. As a result, Li Houxiang and others initiated the formation of the "Shanghai United Harmonica Team" by combining the core members of various harmonica teams in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Shanghai United Harmonica Team has been established for a full year since its founding last August. During this period, under the enthusiastic guidance of famous musicians Li Shuhua, Huang Yongxi, and others, it was invited by the US Fourth Naval Band to perform a great performance at the Grand Theater on February 18 this year, with extremely satisfactory results. It is now reported that the team will hold its first anniversary commemorative music concert at the American Women's General Association on Jing'an Temple Road at 8:30 p.m. today (the 31st). A grand occasion can be expected at that time. Now I will specially introduce four wonderful large ensemble programs in this performance to the readers of this newspaper...</p>
<p>(1) Semiramis Queen Overture (2) Unfinished Symphony (3) Invitation to the Dance (4) Floating Poet. These four large ensembles are all great in scale and worth recommending to readers.</p>
