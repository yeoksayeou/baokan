<h3 id="c12">工部局增加附稅問題商榷 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>於此百物騰貴聲中，上海居民方苦於生活艱難。熱望有出而調整市塲，平準物價者，俾得减輕負袒，稍妤痛苦。孰意公共租界工部局本年度預算之結果，因財政竭蹶，而有增加附稅百分之五十；並將以之為担保，向滙豐銀行借款一千萬元，彌補虧空；據稱，倘不加捐，則工部局預算虧空益將龐大，於以見其加捐之決心。本案之通過與吾，繫於納稅西人年會之手；而納稅華人會則非待舉行特別會議，加以密切研究後，不作正式批評；然與情沸騰，有如報載，亦可以覘知民意矣。故此案在會議席上是否尚有變更之餘地，抑工部局能吾顧及大多數納稅人目前生活所遭遇稀有之痛苦，而於財務及社會民生各方面，重行加以縝密之，考慮，別籌兩全之策，茲猶無從逆料也。</p>
<p>抑工部局虧空何以如是之鉅乎？分析預算，用於薪水年金及津貼者，居支出百分之六十九；蓋其收入悉以法幣為準。而薪給之一部分則以外幣計算。故如月薪為英金二百五十鎊，在戰前折合法幣四千二百餘元，今非付以一萬三千七百餘元不可，前後相差為一與三之比，亦即工部局對此支出，突增三分之二。滙價關係之外，亦有因物價高漲，另給津貼而使工部局增加支出者；然如華員月薪在百元以下不受局方膳食津貼者，月給米貼，至多為七元，即如上一二兩月，米價至五十元左右，而每人所得之米貼，僅七元零四分，是以局方經費，雖對華員亦有所增，然巨大之出入影響，則因外籍人員。現實如斯，殊不牽涉華洋歧視問題，然以客觀分析，得此結果，則研討財務者，宜不漠視之也。</p>
<p>夫以上海表面之繁榮，認為力可負擔大宗稅之明證，此則不但味於實情，忽視危機，抑且對於捐稅轉展轉嫁之最後負擔者，似亦未加體認；申言之，負擔者絕非繁榮中之享受者與獲利者。蓋普遍增加附捐百分之五十，此其轉嫁之結果。仍由大多數之薪工階級為其最後之負擔者；而今日之薪工階級，正苦於物價昂貴，房租高增，其生活旣减無可减，省無可省，亦即負擔已重，加無可加。以房捐言，則大房東可以轉嫁於二房客三房客；以地稅言，則業主可以轉嫁於租：此種理論，淺近易見淌無庸贅述。凡百捐稅，似以加重一般負担為公允，為平衡，然自社會意義觀察之，凡其最後歸宿仍什一般貧窮階級者，不得謂之良稅。何也，責貧富不均者以負袒相均，不合理之至也。此非理論短長，此非信仰出入，此乃事實上之利害得失。工部局而能注意及此，則應加稅於一般負担能力較强者之身上，方為正辦。例如關於娛樂遊戲享用之各種事業，莫不受戰神之厚賜；又如投機性質之各種事業，因環境而異常活躍，且皆順適，凡此事業皆富有資財者所經營所消費而享受，倘若以此為加征正附稅之對象，為開流之財源，則雖至百分之一百二百，乃至三百四百，以其純粹為奢侈稅，亦不為過。此項收入，雖無統計可作計算之依據，然如工部局決心加以整頓，其數必大有可觀，用以裨補財務，當非鮮淺；即使不足以挹注虧空，亦可使其他負担者所負較輕。</p>
<p>奢侈稅劇增之後。倘若仍有增加房捐之必要，則亦不應以一種稅率相征收；務宜詳細釐訂各種標準，分別等差，而輕重其稅率。允應注意最低租値，凡不逮此水準者，仍照舊率徵收，不加附稅。此項辦法，在手續上誠不免比較繁瑣，然增加若于不須外幣給薪之華員助理其事，亦足以了之；而其精神所在，即為貧富其負担，享用與使用，殊其義務。工部局果能為大多數生活維艱者着想，則對於分級徵收房捐辦法，宜加善意考慮也。</p>

<p>招待報界報吿經過</p>
<p>公司總理蕭脫、於昨日下午三時、在康腦脫路寓邸、招待中外報界、報吿此次工潮經過、略謂、本公司機匠、於廿八日下午四時、提出要求改善待遇後、公司方面曾允予自二月　起每人月發給米貼八元四角一分、三月份起再籌辦平糶米、但機匠未能意、當時早班機匠即拒絕離廠、並向公司提出八項要求、公司因須待考慮、不能產時各覆、其時夜班機匠已到廠上工、早班工匠除阻止夜班工作外、並將廠內加油機卸去、致事態漸趨嚴重、翌晨車務處工人到廠後、亦隨同機匠停止工作、並提出十三項要求、捕房方面得悉後、即派探捕到廠維持秩序、並邀請意國防軍共同維持、是日午後、竟兵為保全公司財產及維持治安計、驅逐工人離廠、本公司被迫出此、深為遺憾、然本公司對於工人、向極優待、八年來未嘗發生事故、此次機匠突然罷工、殊為費解、</p>

<p>意兵撤退當局調處</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨特往康腦脫路一一七一號公司門前視察、知該地之意兵、業於前晚完全撤退、改由捕房派探捕駐守保護、門前路上停有經色警備車兩輛、至於前日意兵開放催淚彈受傷之工人十三名、現仍住在醫院治中、大致均可無性命之虞、關於罷工之工人均嚴守秩序、毫無越軌行動、公司門首已無罷工工人矣、又工部局方面除派政治部　前往調查外、工業科方面昨派　炳元前往設法調處、</p>
<p>虞洽卿氏出任斡旋</p>
<p>昨日五峙許、海上聞人虞洽卿氏出為調解、以（一）增加工資四成、（二）增加米貼若干、（三）銅匠得有免費乘坐公司公共汽車、三條件為調解條件、聞該公司買辦蕭脫已允接受考慮、俟今日上午九時徐復、</p>

<p>罷工工人昨開大會</p>
<p>車務機務罷工工人、昨日下午二時三十分、在愚園路開會、除慰問受傷各工人外、對意兵之行動、甚為憤槪、並即成立第三區公共汽車工人聯誼會、並推派代表請願予以援助、此外並推出向公司交涉之代表、</p>

<p>字林西報云、德國袖珍戰艦斯比號、巳在南美洲烏拉圭海面自行鎜沉、其艦上中有華人六名、係担任洗衣工作、頃乘義火利郵船皮洋卡莫諾伯爵號抵滬、據談、斯比號與英巡洋縊艾克斯時號·阿傑克斯號·及阿吉勒斯號·交戰情形稱、當時彼等藏身該艦洗衣間內、所見</p>
<p>作戰情形</p>
<p>雖不甚詳、但聞砲聲隆隆、頗為司怖、旋有一彈穿艙而入　續向對面飛去、彼等乃離洗衣間避往醫療室、至於斯比號所以被英艦發現者、乃因所載偵察機、不能起飛搜索敵艦、斯比號因不得小自行</p>
<p>四出游弋</p>
<p>所致、當斯比號瞭望員瞥見英巡洋艦時、誤認為商船、迄英艦開始連發八吋砲彈、壓於斯比號附近時、艦上諸人、無不大驚、乃力圖逃逸、一面向英艦開放十一吋排砲、</p>
<p>以資擁護</p>
<p>雙方追逐互轟、約三小時半、斯比號終駛入烏拉圭蒙特維多港云、其中一華人会窺視交戰、據談稱、英巡艦三艘中最巨者在中央攻擊、其他兩艘、則在左右兩側助戰、彼等六人、並無傷亡、惟有一人正在洗衣問收藏襯衫時、一彈穿入、適當其面、轟去</p>
<p>襯衫半疊</p>
<p>致受重大震驚、查皮洋卡莫諾伯爵戰來華籟水手共四百二十五人、均曾在自行鑿沉或在中立港被拘之德艦工作者、估計在德船工作之華籍水手因此失業者、至少已有二千人、此次乘義大利郵船抵滬者、多數會在德船亞那托爾號·迦斯拉號·梅克侖堡號·與佛朗克福號工作、此四船今均被枸於南美緒港、</p>

<p>查工部局學務處本年度預算書草案所列各項數目、均經財務學務兩處長會商核减至最低限度、並提交二月二日教育委員會例會審查、</p>
<p>甲、臨時支出門　查臨時支出門各項重要開支、包括（一）膠州路新嘉坡路轉角擬添造可容學生三百人之華童小學一所、需費三三、〇〇〇元、此數經修正後、增至四〇、〇〇〇元、當經通過、（二）西區西童公學擬添建脚踏車棚一所、又華童女子中學擬添建脚踏車棚一所、並加長圍墻、兩共需費六、一〇〇元、旋經決定以上兩脚踏車棚工程、延對來年再辦、（三）西區西童公學內部擬修繕髹漆、並將汽爐一具遷移重裝、准撥工程費一、二〇〇元、又愚園路西童女學擬建大雨走道一條、准撥工程費一二百元、（四）預算書內准列克能海路華童小學圖書室建造費名義上之開支一〇〇元一項、（五）各西童學校零星工程費一、六〇〇元、及華童學校零星工程費一、五〇〇元、兩項均經准撥、</p>
<p>乙、經常支出門　據財務處長報告、學務處各項經常費草案、業經愼重審查並與學務處長會商以後、依照草案所列、增加一四、江九〇元、於是全部經常費計列三、一五七、一九〇元、比上年超出八一七、二七〇元、茲分列比較如下、</p>
<p>以上各項開支所以增加之原因、不外由於各種應用品之高漲、以及增發教職員津貼所致、關於西僑與華人私立學校之補助金、均比上年加列百分之二十五、惟此為試騐性質、不能謂為確定數目、將來當另有報告、</p>
<p>據財務處長報告、關於全部教育經費數額、前經規定小得超過總捐與地稅率之百分之二、上年敎育經費預算為百分之一·八四、旋因開支激增、共經撥發二、六七二、〇〇〇元、適合計項捐率百分之二、但个敷之數、仍達三〇、一五〇元、而本年度虧空、預計當在四六八、三四〇元之譜、此項虧空、是否移人下年度計算、應請董事會決定、</p>
<p>本年全部學費、估計可收六四三、一三〇元、內西童學校二八九、四五〇元、華童學校三五三、六八〇元、財務處長鑒於各校用費激增、會提等將西童與華童各校學費之附加費、分別提高至百分之五十及百分之三十、以資彌補、</p>
<p>當時某委員表示、當總捐率在百分之十四之時、教育經費規定為捐牽百分之二、但現在總捐率已增至百分之十八、而教育經費之比率、仍無變更、如此情形、則學費附加費、應予提高、或即停辦若干所學校、另一委員認為上項限制制度、對於推進教育方面諸多窒碍、况開支繼續增加、維持為難、故本年度教育經費預算、殊不能謂為之鉅、亦無可予核減之理由、又另一委員表示、如果本年加撥總捐半厘、則本年預計之虧空、即可掃數抵消、且此後教育經費之比率、應與總捐率、同時提增、以應需要、</p>
<p>以上經臨預算、均經教育委員會通過、准提交財務委員會審查、各委員最後並議決向局方建議、儻維持非常時期之教育工作着想、所有前項教育經費之限制辦法、應予取消、</p>

<h3 id="c104">此路不通！ <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 黃嘉音</p>
<p>我說現社會制度已經走上牛角尖似的死路，這並不是故乍驚人之語，而是一種千眞萬確的實在情形。我們祇要看社會矛盾的尖銳化，就可以明白我說的是甚麽息思了。</p>
<p>天津發生了飢民搶麵粉的悲劇，驚察為維持秩序起見，開槍鎮壓，結果擊斃飢民六名。</p>
<p>在現狀下，這些飢民遲早是要餓死的，所以擊斃六個，算不了甚麼事。可是從這一件慘痛的事實，我們可以很明顯地看出現社會的悲哀與徬徨；</p>
<p>麵粉是要吃的，可是現在却拿麵粉囤積起來，使許多人望麵粉而興嘆　這似乎是麵粉商人的錯誤。可是麵粉是商人所有的，所有權在他手頭，他要怎辦就怎辦，別人管他不得。所以麵粉舖的老板又似沒有錯兒，理直氣壯。</p>
<p>警察的職務是要維持社會秩序的安寗，所以看見飢民搶麵粉而聞槍，應該是名正言順的。可是飢腸轆轆的窮人，肚子實在餓得壞了，看見那麽多的麵粉堆置着，由於天然的要求，食指大動，羣起而搶之，你又怎能無綠無故地把人打死，難道窮人沒有生活的權利嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c105">水雷 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 陸德鋼</p>
<p>自從歐戰爆發以來，我們看見報上所載，英法和很多中立國的船隻，被德方水雷所炸沉的不知凡幾。還有其他在海洋中捕魚的漁船，因觸雷而遭沉沒的，更不知有多少。但因漁船大都很小，所以雖每日總有多艘沉掉，但普通報紙上都忽略不載。</p>
<p>水電究竟是什麽樣的東西？為什麼這樣厲害？其構造如何？想讀者們必然樂於知道吧</p>
<p>水雷幷分兩種，一種呌固定水雷，另一種叫磁性水雷。我們先談第一種：</p>
<p>一個國定水雷，共分兩部構成；第一部是一個能浮在水面的中空鐵球。球內儲有强烈的炸藥，重量的有一百至二百公斤，球上裝有三個金屬包裹的玻璃管型之觸角，只要其中仟何一觸碰着船殼時，玻璃管便破碎，管中所盛的琉酸流入一電池內；於是立即便有電流發生，使炸藥在頃劉間爆炸。構成固定水雷的第二部份是一隻蛙樣的鐵錨，具有四個小輪，使在裝置水雷船上搬動時較為便利，錨上穿有鐵索一根，使運結能浮動的鐵球。</p>
<p>埋置水雷時所用的船，不論普通輪船，軍艦，或潛水艇都可用。埋置的方法也很簡單：先將水雷的錨拋下，使牢理在海底下。錨上的鐵索將鐵球繫在一固定深度的海水中，使球不能任意上浮。球在水面下的深度視情形而定；若騰水需是為炸水面之船而設，則鐵球的在水面下二公尺的深度；若為炸潛艇之用，那麼鐵球的在二十公尺的深度。</p>
<p>這種固定水雷的佈置，也分兩種：第一種叫念佛珠式，就是說將一排水雷，置成一字長蛇陳式，有時並且各决雷間都用繩索相牽連；第二種名四普放式，就是說將好幾排水電先後排置而成。</p>
<p>在上次大戰時，英國和美國的海軍當局，為破壞德軍的潛艇計，會佈置一條由蘇格蘭至北海挪威的長水雷陣，總共埋去水雷七萬七千零三十個。</p>
<p>其决我們要講到磁性水雷了，磁性水雷構造的原理大致和固定水雷相同，不過磁性水雷沒有錨而帶吸鐵性，隨波逐流而行，沒有固定的方位。所以這種水雷的危險性更大。依據國際公法上規定是不可使用的，但目前德國却不顧這些，大量應用，害得建中立國的船隻也時常無辜遭受水雷的攻擊。所以英法海軍當局，每日派出許多掃雷艦在洋面上打撈這種水雷，日夜相繼，這工作是辛苦而危險，但他們相信總有一天能將這些可怖的東西悉數掃除的！</p>

<h3 id="c106">中國之友—詹森大使 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— 夏楚</p>
<p>詹森大使矮胖得像一隻枕頭。五十三歲的他，頭髮眉毛眼睫毛都己經是稀薄而呈淡金色了。他的臉色紅潤，鼻子相當的大，下頰堅强，嘴上的笑容？永不會間斷。照他的樣子，活像是一個美國商八，倒不大像是美利堅合衆國的全權大使。</p>
<p>十一年以前—即一九二九年，他就做駐華的公使了。一九三五年，他晋級成為美國駐華的第一任大使，薪俸也從一萬元美金昇到一萬七千五百元。這幾年來，却巧碰到中國的多事之秋，美國是最關心遠東的安危的，詹森大使的責任也無疑越發的重大了。</p>
<p>他在前淸時候，就到了中國。廿四歲的時候，已經在上海「新衙門」裏做法官，這證明他同中國關係發生得多麽的早！一九一八年，被召返國，在國務院遠東司裏担任職務。後來昇為遠東司司長，四十歲，他成了國務副卿，再隔兩年，駐華使節的重任就落在他的肩上，一直到現在。</p>
<p>他實在是一個中國通，能够講一口好國語，不但能够看得懂中文的報紙，而且還能讀古文。他的語言學天才本是很出色的，在美國華盛頓大學唸書的時候，他就把希臘，拉丁，德文亦得很好了。他能唱中國歌曲，還彈得一手好琵琶。在高朋雲集的時候，若能叫他來高歌一闋，再沒有東西比這更有趣的了。</p>
<p>詹森大使沒有官架子，他有着美國人的不拘禮的謙和態度。接見新聞記者的時候，身上往往只穿着襯衫。宴會的時候，他總歡喜坐在地板上。酒喝得很少，香烟愛抽一種很便宜的哈德門牌。生平最愛讀一本「阿麗思漫游奇境記」，也常在中國各碼頭跑來跑去，這本書是總帶在身邊的。他也愛讀偵探小說。除了中國的琵琶以外，他還能玩好幾種西洋的樂器。打高爾夫球的資格也是很老到的。</p>
<p>大使夫人間名珍蓓克（Jane　Beck），現在同兩個孩子都住在北平。北平說來還是大使結婚的地點。原來一九三一年，大使夫人同她的兄弟週游全球，到了北平，恰巧夫人的家庭和大使的家庭是三代世交，所以她就住在使館裏面。有一天，獨身的公使忽然通知他的友好，說明天六點鐘他要同珍小姐結婚了。這樣，她就成了他的夫人。</p>
<p>大使在重慶的時候，早晨七點起身，吃了一頓豐盛的早餐以後，坐了四人扛抬的橋子到使館去辦公。那邊有四十多封從中國各處來的電報，要他閱覽，而且還得答覆。夜裏他偶然也請客人來吃一頓純男客的夜飯，不然便讀了些輕鬆的諫物，上床安寢。</p>
<p>大使的生活是很艱苦的。半夜裏也許會給空襲警報所吵醒，忽忽的避到防空壕去。大使館有一座堅固的防空壕，但是假如它直接給炸彈擊中，那也得化為粉碎的了。上次大使巡視長江的時候，會經有不利大使的謠言，後來虧得化為無事。為了中美間的親密的友誼，我們敬在這裏祝福詹森大使的安全和健康！</p>

<p>— 淸</p>
<p>間諜，因為負有特殊的任務，所以人材之選擇，必須嚴厲。而且還需要加以一個長時期的訓練，才能完成為一個有為的間諜。</p>
<p>在平時，覜諜的訓練大概是由專門的人才負責的；而在戰時，則由資望較深的老間諜負責。</p>
<p>德國間諜的訓練，是比較嚴風而科學化的，因為德國有專門訓練間諜的學校，尤其是在德國柏林的陸軍大學中，附有諜報的特別班。他們的學員是直接由陸軍部長在陸軍大學畢業生中指定的，規定是二年畢業。他們的課程是：一·諜報發展史；二·諜報之组織；三·諜報之策略與計劃。四。技術和智識；五·偵察之重要與方法；六·心理學；七·攝影學；八·人體測騐學；九·外國文。並且還有三個月對六個月之實習工作，他們將來的位置，即依照此種實習工作成績之優劣為標準。</p>
<p>德國，不僅在國內嚴密訓練，在各軍團中，亦有訓練間諜的專校，他們的課程是：一。敵軍的編制；二·敵軍的識別，三。武器口徑之辨別；四·鞏固陣地之特徵；五·地圖地物之識別，六·爆炸學；七·被捕後之供辨該。這些功課，都口授的，並且是因人而異的，因為這是對於受訓練者將來被派往國而定，至於他們畢業的時期，大概重要的間諜是二三個星期至一月或一個半月；不重要的行探，就僅只有十天左右至三星期而已。</p>
<p>雜感</p>
<h3 id="c109">大學敎育 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 家樹</p>
<p>英國著名教育家亨利紐門說：「大學教育之目的在於提高社會上的智識水準，鍛鍊一般民衆的思想，澄淸民族的嗜好，改進時代的精神，美化個人的生活……它要訓練人們勝任各種職位和熟悉各種事情。」</p>
<p>他又說：一個大學生必須其有淸靜的頭腦，正確的觀點，和鐵活的口才；他知道甚麽時候應開口或緘默，他能很確切地提鐵或回答問題，他能講，能聽，能嚴肅，能詼諧……。」</p>
<p>我並不奢望我們的大學教育能够百分之百地達到這些目的，我們的大學生個個能够符合這些標準，不，但願他們眞正「為教育而教育」，少製一批只知「循規蹈矩」，「唯命是聽」的書櫥，或整天看影戲跑舞塲的寶貝，就算是萬幸的了。</p>

<p>— 韻</p>
<p>這是溜冰鉅片的一朶銀花。它以更新的姿態出現在銀壇上，溜冰塲面，全部五彩，無疑地造成絕無僅有的電影奇蹟，「水樹銀花」的轟動全滬，是必然的事實。</p>
<p>主演的人物是瓊克勞馥，騰姆斯史都華，劉亞理斯三大明星。表演溜冰的男女明星，是全美聞名的萬國水　豔舞團，所有的男女演員，全是經過相常苦統的歲月，有出神入化的演出，這部片的舞技，比起過去任何溜冰片來，另有一番風格，它融合雄闊細膩的作風，有印第安土風舞母鵝廻旋舞滑稽鴛鴦舞及天魔探戈舞；全部煊染着天然五彩，呈現着更美化的觀感。</p>
<p>情節充滿着悲感的成份。把藝人的苦痛充份顯露出米，妻子投身到影片公司，公司造就她明星地位，却附帶一個莫名其妙的條件，就是要抱獨身主義到底，結果，一對結婚的藝人，當着羣衆面前，只能視同陌路，她倆內心的痛苦，就可想而知了。瓊克勞馥在「水桛銀花」中，獨唱“Something's　Golta　Happen　Soon歌，値得每個影迷去賞聽一下的。</p>
<h3 id="c112">戰鼓情花 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>「戰鼓情花」是寫美利豎立國之初，所經過的堅苦奮鬥情形。劇作者在一對新婚夫婦身上，展開了一頁正義的史實。同時在美國電影中也弟一次寫出印第安人的淺鐵，痛恨白人，是有着幕後的主動者，他們的所作所為，不過是供人驅策的傀儡而已。</p>
<p>我們自然很高興能够看到這樣的電影，因有它昭示我們建立一個自由的國家，是要從荊棘業中去覓取和平的大道的，美利堅立國時的情形，也正是我們現在所處的時代。</p>
<p>但是這個戲的分聽是喧賓奪主的，璧如克勞黛考爾白產子塲戲，在整個劇本中之無關緊要的塲戲，而且正當義勇軍歸來之後，應該是更堅定意志，去走完最後的一道關，它的儘量描寫羣衆的歡樂，和亨利方達第一次做父親的驚喜交集，是會使後面的戲鬆弛下來的；雖然單以這塲戲講，是很精彩的塲戲。</p>
<p>至於導演的翰福特，他接受了這劇本中的該諧之處加以描寫，也是失策的，譬如奥主佛在印第安人入室之後，拼命保護她的床；在變方進攻的時候，又因為她的死去而轉入另一塲面，這一切却减低了劇本本身的價値，同時全劇也失去聯繫的力量。</p>
<p>亨利方達沉着有力。克勞黛考爾白我以為　是演喜劇相宜。</p>

<p>近來劇界人材缺乏，鬚生及武生行更有才難之歡，從前還覺得京朝派略勝一籌，現在却不能這樣講了。我們試拿周信芳說吧，他除了嗓音帶沙，唱的部分難與北來諸伶一較短長外，若論作派表情和身上腿上的工夫，的確速勝於馬譚諸人。同時他的技術也深得平角一致推許，可見祇要貨眞價實，不怕不為識家所激賞呢。我還記得二十年前本埠二馬路天蟾舞臺邀請小樓南下演唱時，老伶工李春來適亦與楊同隸一臺，彼時的春來業已花甲以外，牙齒脫落，而小樓則方在中年，正是馳聘歌壇的時候，二人雖同屬南北武生行中之泰山北斗，惟李係長於短打，宗法黃胖，（月山）楊則擅演長靠，繼承毛包（俞菊生）之衣缽，所謂井水不犯河水，各有專長的拿手戲也。小樓久振李名，聞其盛時，嘗自携配角數十人，有所謂哼哈二將，四大金剛，三十六觔斗蟲之說。如老伶工沈韻秋，晚年會出演亦舞豪甚久，渠即哼哈二將之一也。又如開口跳譚永奎，武凈李德山、鞠德奎、武旦祁彩芬、水上飄、等，均會先後隨李出演，列入金剛之數，其後蓋叫天繼春來之後而為南方短打武生之祭酒，沈、李、祁、諸人復為蓋老五羅致以去，亦取駕輕就熟之意也。</p>

<p>Tianjin: The export of animal hides and furs from North China is now subject to another layer of Japanese restrictions, namely, prior approval from the Japanese military authorities is required before shipment. Previously, merchants exporting furs and hides to the United States via parcel post had to obtain approval from the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin. However, now an additional restriction has been added. However, when local leather and fur exporters today sought export permits from the Japanese military authorities, the Japanese military claimed that they were not yet ready to issue such permits. However, the Japanese military can send people to the post office to inspect packages awaiting shipment. It is reported that today, there are one hundred packages of leather goods awaiting shipment to the United States piled up in the General Post Office here, all awaiting inspection by the Japanese. However, the Japanese army has not sent anyone to inspect them, so they cannot be shipped. Exporters are feeling extremely anxious about this, and are afraid that if the goods are not allowed to be shipped, they will not be able to be transported back to the French Concession, as the General Post Office is located near the Japanese-controlled area, so the Japanese can arbitrarily interfere.

<p>Yingde: Anti-war sentiment is intensifying among Japanese troops in various places. On February 8th, the Fukuyama unit of the Japanese army in Guangzhou disobeyed orders and moved independently, occupying the Japanese army hospital for wounded soldiers at the Qianyan Tang Military Academy, which was a secret organization of the Anti-War League of Japanese Soldiers. The Japanese military police cracked the case, seized a large number of anti-war propaganda materials, and arrested two anti-war leaders, who were executed on the spot. As a result, all the wounded Japanese soldiers in the hospital went on a hunger strike, and the Japanese commander Ando was unable to take any measures. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters in Tokyo urgently dispatched Prince Chichibu to Guangzhou on February 16th to appease the troops, but to no avail. Now the situation is escalating, and anti-war sentiment is brewing among Japanese troops in Nanning, Hainan Island, Shantou, and other places. Prince Chichibu also flew to inspect the situation, but was unable to resolve it. (1st Telegram)</p>

<p>Suiyuan West: A reporter telegraphed back from the front line on the evening of the 28th. Passing through Linhe, Shanba, Huangyangmutou, and other places, he witnessed the burning, killing, looting, and plunder by the Japanese, and the post-disaster situation was extremely tragic. In the above places, nine out of ten houses were empty, and they had all been turned into rubble. Among them, the burning and killing in the Catholic Church of Sandaohe and the villages of Ulan淖, etc., were the most severe and unbearable to witness. On the 16th and 17th, Japanese aircraft released poison gas in Linhe and Huangyangmutou, causing the death and injury of many women and children. Later, they scattered blistering gas near Wuzhen, causing fewer deaths. The remaining Japanese troops entrenched in Wuyuan are now very few in number. The Chinese army has advanced to the vicinity of Wuyuan, trapping the Japanese in a heavy siege, and cutting off the transportation routes east of Wuyuan, making it easy to wipe them out in one fell swoop.

<h3 id="e12">Discussion on the Issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council Increasing Surtaxes <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>At a time when prices are soaring, Shanghai residents are struggling with difficult living conditions. They fervently hope that someone will come forward to adjust the market and stabilize prices, so as to alleviate their burdens and ease their suffering. Unexpectedly, the result of the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget for this year is that, due to financial exhaustion, there is an increase of 50% in surtaxes. This will be used as collateral to borrow ten million yuan from the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation to make up for the deficit. It is claimed that if the surtax is not increased, the Municipal Council's budget deficit will become even larger, thus demonstrating their determination to increase the surtax. Whether this proposal passes or not rests in the hands of the foreign ratepayers at the annual meeting. The Chinese ratepayers, on the other hand, will not make a formal criticism until after holding a special meeting to study the matter closely. However, the public's sentiments are boiling, as reported in the newspapers, which is also indicative of public opinion. Therefore, it is still impossible to predict whether there is any room for change in this proposal at the meeting, or whether the Municipal Council will consider the rare suffering currently experienced by the majority of taxpayers in their lives, and conduct a thorough review of financial, social, and livelihood aspects, and devise a mutually beneficial strategy.</p>
<p>But why is the Municipal Council's deficit so large? Analyzing the budget, salaries, pensions, and subsidies account for 69% of the expenditure. This is because its income is all based on legal tender (fapi), while a portion of the salaries are calculated in foreign currency. For example, a monthly salary of £250, which before the war was equivalent to over 4,200 fapi, now has to be paid over 13,700 fapi. The difference is a ratio of one to three, meaning that the Municipal Council's expenditure on this has suddenly increased by two-thirds. In addition to exchange rate issues, the Municipal Council also has increased expenditure due to high prices and the provision of additional subsidies. However, for Chinese staff with monthly salaries below one hundred yuan who do not receive meal subsidies from the Bureau, the rice subsidy is at most seven yuan. Even in the last two months, when the price of rice was around fifty yuan, each person only received a rice subsidy of seven yuan and four cents. Therefore, although the Bureau's expenses have also increased for Chinese staff, the significant impact is due to foreign staff. The reality is such that it does not involve the issue of discrimination between Chinese and foreigners, but an objective analysis yields this result, so those studying finance should not ignore it.</p>
<p>To assume that Shanghai's superficial prosperity is proof of its ability to bear a large amount of taxes is not only oblivious to the actual situation and ignores the crisis, but also seems to fail to recognize the final bearers of the burden of taxes that are passed down through various layers. In other words, the bearers are definitely not those who enjoy and profit from prosperity. Generally increasing the surtax by 50% will ultimately result in the majority of the wage-earning class bearing the burden. Today's wage-earning class is already suffering from high prices and soaring rents. Their lives have been reduced as much as possible and saved as much as possible. That is to say, the burden is already heavy and cannot be increased further. In terms of house tax, the large landlords can pass it on to the second and third tenants; in terms of land tax, the owners can pass it on to the renters. This kind of theory is simple and easy to understand, so there is no need to elaborate further. It seems fair and balanced to increase the general burden through all kinds of taxes, but from a social perspective, anything that ultimately falls on the general poor class cannot be called a good tax. Why? It is extremely unreasonable to ask the unequal wealthy and poor to bear the same burden. This is not a matter of the merits of the theory, nor a matter of differences in beliefs, but a matter of actual gains and losses. If the Municipal Council can pay attention to this, then it should increase the tax on those with a greater ability to bear the burden, which is the right thing to do. For example, various businesses related to entertainment, games, and enjoyment are all greatly blessed by the god of war. Also, various businesses with a speculative nature are unusually active due to the environment, and are all smoothly operated. These businesses are all operated, consumed, and enjoyed by those with wealth. If these are the targets for increasing regular surtaxes, and the source of new revenue, then even if it is increased to 100%, 200%, or even 300% or 400%, it would not be excessive, because it is purely a luxury tax. Although there are no statistics to calculate this revenue, if the Municipal Council is determined to rectify it, the amount will definitely be considerable, and it would be sufficient to supplement the finances. Even if it is not enough to fill the deficit, it can still make the burden lighter for those who bear other burdens.</p>
<p>After the luxury tax is drastically increased, if it is still necessary to increase the house tax, then it should not be collected with a single tax rate. It is necessary to carefully formulate various standards, differentiate between levels, and vary the tax rates accordingly. Attention should be paid to the lowest rental value. Those who do not reach this level should still be taxed at the old rate, without increasing the surtax. This method may be more cumbersome in terms of procedure, but it can be solved by increasing the number of Chinese assistants who do not need to be paid in foreign currency. The spirit of this is to differentiate the burden between the rich and the poor, and to differentiate the obligations of those who enjoy and those who use. If the Municipal Council can think for the majority who are struggling to make a living, then it should give serious consideration to the method of levying house tax in grades.</p>
<p>There is one more thing I would like to tell the Municipal Council. After the rumor of increasing the surtax spread, the talk of reducing expenses arose accordingly, focusing on items such as the band. I believe that there is no end to the debate on the branches and leaves of finance. However, the so-called public economy, which follows the economic principle of "spending according to income" should not be quoted in this abnormally transformed society. Everything that can increase the living standards of the citizens, and everything that can be avoided should be avoided. Although Shanghai is prosperous, it cannot be compared with London or New York. Therefore, when dealing with the public economy, one should use the perspective of Shanghai, save what can be saved, economize what should be economized, and spend according to income. This is also a way to balance the budget.</p>

<p>8. All the above-mentioned companies are organized as (special legal persons) with the nature of (special companies). In other words, they obtain special rights and interests based on special agreements, in order to monopolize the special professions of Central China. In addition, there are ordinary commercial companies organized as (ordinary legal persons) to seize various economic benefits. This mechanism is centered on the (Central China Development Company). The company invests in the organization of various companies to form an extortion network, which functions much like the (South Manchuria Railway Company). Therefore, the Japanese also signed the so-called (Directing and Supervising the Sino-Japanese Joint Ventures Invested by the Central China Development Co., Ltd.) with the puppet organization to determine the scope of the Japanese local authorities and the puppet organization's exercise of guidance and supervision. The original text is as follows: Directing and Supervising the Sino-Japanese Joint Ventures Invested by the Central China Development Co., Ltd. 1. Guiding Principle: The Japanese local authorities and the Reformed Government authorities shall cooperate with each other to promote the revival of the Central China economy and implement the gist of Sino-Japanese cooperation. The two authorities must closely coordinate and handle matters fully and quickly with respect to guiding and supervising the Sino-Japanese joint ventures (hereinafter referred to as "joint ventures") invested by the Central China Development Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "Development Co."), in order to ensure smooth development. 2. Key Points: (1) The government, unless otherwise stipulated in the articles of association, applies the relevant laws to the company, and is responsible for administrative supervision in the spirit of promoting the company's activities. (2) The joint venture must obtain the government's approval for the following matters: 1. The establishment of the articles of association and changes to important regulations; 2. The appointment or dismissal of the Chairman (President) and Vice Chairman (Vice President); 3. Resolutions on mergers or dissolutions. However, with respect to the Shanghai Hengchan Co., Ltd., in addition to the foregoing, the following items are specifically added: (1) The issuance of prize-bearing corporate bonds and lottery tickets; (1) The disposition of profits; (1) Other important matters in the business. When the government approves the foregoing, it shall first cooperate with the Japanese local authorities. (3) With respect to the handling of the bankruptcy declaration of the joint venture and the dissolution of the company, the government shall first consult with the Japanese local authorities to handle the matter properly. (4) When the government issues orders to the joint venture due to public interest or military necessity, it shall first consult with the Japanese local authorities and cooperate with each other to handle the matter. The losses suffered by the joint venture due to the aforementioned orders shall be compensated by the government. (5) The Japanese local authorities may request the government to issue the aforementioned orders. However, in cases of emergency due to military reasons, the Japanese local authorities may directly make necessary requests to the joint venture and notify the government of its intention. (6) The Japanese local authorities and the government shall ensure that the joint venture obtains the approval of the Development Co. for the following matters: (1) Appointment or dismissal of the manager (executive), director (manager), accounting director, and technical director; (2) Changes to the articles of association; (3) Resolutions on mergers or dissolutions; (4) Business plans; (5) Issuance of corporate bonds; (6) Other important matters in the business.

<p>London: Conservative Party member Morgan asked in the House of Commons last night whether the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers have been opened for general trade as promised by the Prime Minister on December 18. If not, to what extent are commercial and shipping activities in these two areas currently restricted? Foreign Under-Secretary Butler replied in writing that neither the Yangtze nor the Pearl River has been opened. Current arrangements for the Pearl River allow one British ship to go to Guangzhou once a week. As for the Yangtze River, navigation above Jiangyin remains closed to third-country shipping. Even below Jiangyin, British ships face some difficulties. He said that these difficulties have been brought to the attention of the Japanese authorities. Morgan also asked what steps the British government has taken regarding the resumption of British inland navigation within the Yangtze River Delta, apart from the Yangtze River itself, and whether British ships can now freely travel along their original routes. Butler stated in his written reply that Foreign Secretary Halifax is currently instructing local British authorities to prepare a report on the current situation in the inland waterways.

<p>London: Conservative Member of Parliament Sandeman stated in the House of Commons that the Japanese are still stingy in allowing British ships access to Qingdao docks, and that the only dock nominally available to foreign ships is either occupied by the Japanese or unusable. He asked if the Prime Minister was aware that the Japanese intend to obstruct British trade for another year, and whether the Japanese government would genuinely try to end the serious incidents harming British trade and dignity. Under-Secretary Butler replied in writing that until March 25, 1939, third-country ships had to anchor outside Qingdao port to load and unload cargo. Since that date, one jetty and two berthing areas have been opened, but without warehousing facilities, and these docks and berths are very unsafe in bad weather. In addition to these difficulties, all berths were occupied by Japanese ships for three months last year. Only after the end of October could British ships resume using the docks, and the third berth has also been available since January 13. From the perspective of British shipping, there are still many dissatisfactions, but it feels that there have been some improvements recently. The British government will continue to push for improvements whenever the opportunity arises. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Strict Japanese Inspection of News Telegrams Discussed in the House of Representatives <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo: News telegrams sent from Japan are about to be subjected to stricter inspection, as the matter has recently been discussed in the Japanese House of Representatives. According to a certain member, the current method of controlling telegrams has many shortcomings. This is because the four ministries of Home Affairs, Communications, Foreign Affairs, and the Army each control newspapers. Now, the inspection matters should be uniformly handled by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Home Minister Kodama replied that telegrams sent overseas are now inspected by the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Communications is cooperating with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the best of its ability. To ensure the speed and integrity of the inspection procedures, it is indeed necessary to entrust this matter to one ministry for exclusive handling. He will carefully study this matter together with the relevant ministries. For the time being, he believes that close cooperation between the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Home Affairs has already resulted in sufficient control over news telegrams sent overseas. Previously, Japanese inspection of news telegrams was relatively lenient. What was deleted was mostly military and alarming news, as well as predictions about domestic political situation. Foreign reporters who sent the telegrams were not notified after deletion. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)</p>

<p>Washington: Retired former commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, wrote a letter today to Representative Shulenbai, the initiator of the bill on embargoing Japan, stating, "In social life, purely adopting a policy of 'appeasement' towards those who violate the law is absolutely ineffective. This is shown by the facts. At the same time, recent experience tells us that reasoning, principles, and laws are also ineffective with countries that deliberately invade peaceful nations, disregard the suffering of the people, and disregard humane treaties. In the past two and a half years, the blatant destruction and contempt of the U.S. rights and interests in China by Japan is countless. This shows that Japan firmly believes that trampling on U.S. rights and interests will not lead to a U.S.-Japan war, otherwise Japan would certainly not dare to do so. Furthermore, the friendship between the United States and China is a great asset of the United States, and it must not be abandoned. Therefore, our current problem is to decide whether we can allow a country that idealizes militarism to dominate this vast region. In short, if Japan's current adventure is successful, then its military warlords will certainly be able to prolong their control of the regime. Therefore, Japan's continued aggression is inevitable. For our own benefit, we should quickly decide to take active steps to help countries whose political ideals are the same as ours, because if the democratic countries of Europe and China in Asia fail in this war, our future will also be in danger."

<p>Washington: Jesse Jones, chairman of the U.S. Reconstruction Finance Corporation, told reporters yesterday that after Congress passes the bill to increase the capital of the U.S. Export-Import Bank by $100 million, Finland will "first" obtain a loan from the bank. China is seeking to borrow another $20 million in credit from the bank. China is willing to export tin ore to the U.S. to repay the new loan. "If China can guarantee that we can obtain tin ore, then we will lend China the loan." China has already exceeded the amount listed on the repayment schedule for the last loan.

<p>Moscow: Recently, "The Japan Times" published a commentary on Franco-Japanese relations, stating, "Negotiations on the Japanese bombing of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway have completely failed." Pravda commented on this matter, "Japan is taking various steps (military and diplomatic) to cut off the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, thereby preventing all goods from being transported to China via Indochina. Although this action by Japan has aroused opposition from Britain, the United States, and France, Britain, the United States, and France are extremely uneasy about Japan's activities in South China, as Japan is now approaching their most important colonies in Southeast Asia. The importance of Indochina to France's economic life is well known. Even in terms of the European War, Indochina can supply raw materials and various goods to the country. In particular, all of France's needs for rubber are taken from Indochina. Therefore, the French side expresses extreme unease about Japan's offensive in South China. This sense of unease has spread to the United States, as the United States is deeply afraid of Japan's power expanding to the South China Sea. In short, this conflict between Japan and France fully proves that the contradictions of imperialism in the Pacific are becoming increasingly acute." (TASS dispatch dated one day)</p>

Daladier said, "Bolshevism and National Socialism are equivalent to cholera epidemics. The situation in Europe is bad. France must participate in war once every twenty-five years. Currently, France has decided to eliminate this bad situation." France is now expecting the German army to launch a major offensive in the spring. As for whether the Allied forces will counterattack if the German army does not attack at that time, it has not yet been decided, but it is quite possible.

Turkey has spent £30 million on the army in the past year. The recent implementation of Turkey's emergency decrees has been misunderstood by people at home and abroad. In fact, rumors that Turkey has declared a state of emergency and ordered mobilization, and that it is preparing offensive and defensive steps against the Soviet Union are all unfounded. Whether Turkey joins the war will be entirely determined by the concept of national interest. The reason why Turkey has adopted emergency decrees is only to prepare in case foreign changes make it impossible for Turkey to rely solely on its ordinary national laws. War and mobilization are major responsibilities that Turkish politicians must bear. They cannot be carried out lightly. They must be given the closest consideration. This action can only be taken when the country and its survival are threatened. Turkey's relations with the Soviet Union have not changed in the past six months. We do not want to take anti-Soviet actions, nor do we see any reason for the Soviet Union to attack us. Our purpose is very clear. The issue of our participation in the war and our diplomacy will never be controlled by external forces. The disturbances outside our borders cannot prevent us from making appropriate judgments with a calm mind. The storm that is now spreading to most of the world is already at our doorstep. He knows that all the people of the country will be able to fulfill their responsibilities. (Reuter dispatch dated one day)</p>
<p>Istanbul: Turkish Prime Minister Saydam stated in a speech last night that Turkey is seeking to adopt an aggressive attitude towards the Soviet Union, and at the same time, the Soviet Union does not currently have any signs of attacking Turkey. Saydam continued that since Turkey implemented the law to protect the national economy, rumors have arisen and are alarming. In fact, this move does not indicate Turkey's mobilization, nor does it indicate that Turkey is about to participate in the war, because the constitution clearly stipulates that Turkey must obtain the public approval of Congress before participating in the war. Relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey have not changed in the past six months. (Haitong dispatch dated one day)</p>

<p>Geneva: Reports from Swiss newspaper correspondents stationed in the Balkans all stated that the capitals of the Balkan countries are rife with rumors that the Allied powers will soon plunge the Near East into war. The reports claimed, "The Balkan Peninsula is now considered to be on the verge of the outbreak of war on the Caucasian front, or even conflict on the borders of the Soviet Union with Iran and Afghanistan. General Weygand, commander-in-chief of the Anglo-French Allied forces in the Near East, has apparently planned to attack the Baku oil region, with the aim of destroying the Soviet Union's wartime infrastructure and preventing the transport of Soviet oil to Germany. If this is the case, the European war will enter its second phase. According to Swiss correspondents, telephone communications between Turkey and Yugoslavia have been severed. Although the true extent of the threat of war to Asia Minor is unknown, the mobilization measures of Turkey and the countries of Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan all indicate that the situation in the Near East has reached a critical juncture." (Haitong dispatch dated one day)</p>
<p>Rome: Romanian political commentator Cica Mu wrote an article in "Curentul" today, discussing the possibility of "amazing events" in the Near East, stating that because of the proximity of the Caucasian oil fields to the Near East and the increasing cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union, the Allied powers will launch an offensive in the region. If this is the case, Turkey's attitude will carry significant weight. If Turkey maintains its neutrality, the Black Sea will be outside the war zone, and then the shipping of all countries neighboring the Black Sea will be completely reorganized.

<p>Rome: Observers here are closely watching the Near East issue. They forcefully stated that the sudden increase in rumors about Turkey in recent days is clearly spread by the Allied powers. They are paying unusual attention to rumors such as Soviet troops in the Caucasus fleeing into Turkey, Soviet submarines being found in the Bosphorus Strait, and Turkey recalling overseas merchant ships. The Paris "Times" reported that the Turkish army is poorly equipped and lacks mechanized units. People in Turkish military circles claimed that it is absurd for the Allied powers to hope that Turkey will launch an offensive in the Caucasus while reiterating the weakness of the Turkish army. Turkish shipping companies have denied recalling merchant ships. Political figures here are very satisfied because this news will affect Italian-Turkish trade. (Haitong dispatch dated one day)</p>
<p>Rome: People close to official sources here said that the British government is rumored to have requested Turkey, based on the 1936 Montreux Convention, to allow its warships to pass through the Dardanelles and Bosphorus Straits to the Black Sea to protect shipping. Although this has not yet been confirmed, if it is true, the Italian government should also make a similar request, because the Italian government signed the Mediterranean Agreement with Britain on April 16, 1938, and signed the Montreux Convention on May 2 of the same year. Although Turkey has special ties with Britain and France through a mutual assistance pact, the various clauses contained in the Montreux Convention are still fully effective. Italy is in the same position as other signatory countries and should not be discriminated against. Moreover, it is difficult to predict how the current European war will develop. In order to prepare for the future, Italy must pay attention to the safety of its overseas shipping lines. In short, no matter what happens in the Balkans and the Near East, Italy cannot turn a blind eye. (Havas dispatch dated the 29th)</p>
<p>London: It has been rumored from the Italian side that the British government has already requested Turkey, based on the 1936 Montreux Convention, to allow British warships to pass through the Dardanelles Strait into the Black Sea to protect shipping.

German Deputy Foreign Minister Weizsäcker and Director of Protocol Dörnberg both went to the station to welcome him. Welles' visit is of an informal nature, so only representatives of the German government, members of the U.S. Embassy, and a few journalists welcomed him at the station.

According to sources in the German Foreign Ministry, Hitler intends to explain the reasons why the war is unavoidable and ask for the U.S.'s understanding. He will also state that Germany's current war is being fought for justice, so that Germany can obtain an equal position in Europe. As for the peace offensive, Germany is unlikely to launch it for the time being, for fear that this action will be seen as a weakness. (Associated Press dispatch dated one day)</p>

<p>London: Lord Tavistock and the British Christian Reconstruction Organization in Europe have published a so-called peace plan. Most British newspapers are not interested in it. Newspapers such as "The Times" have completely ignored it. According to a Reuter diplomatic correspondent, political circles do not pay attention to this plan, believing that it is just another expression of the peace offensive launched by the German propaganda machine, and that it is obviously contrary to Hitler's recent speech. It is rumored that the plan is currently supported by the German side, which stipulates (1) the reconstruction of the Slovak state, but on the condition of maintaining neutrality, (2) the restoration of an independent Polish state, giving it access to the sea and railway transportation facilities, and the right to use the Vistula River, (3) Germany can hold a referendum in Austria, but will not accept international intervention, (4) If other powers are willing to reduce armaments, Germany is also prepared to do so, (5) Germany is prepared to rejoin the League of Nations, but must obtain a guarantee of fair action, (6) Germany is prepared to consider suggestions that it can obtain raw materials from colonies, and if these raw materials are not paid for with gold, then Germany may not insist on reclaiming the colonies. Lord Tavistock, the initiator of the aforementioned plan, has been quite active in participating in communism, peace, and national socialism in recent years. One of his old comrades is "Lord Haw Haw," who is now believed to be in Germany working as an English broadcaster. Another person, Coning, is a member of the aforementioned committee and recently still belonged to the British Fascist Party. British officials pointed out that Britain's peace goals have long been fully clarified in the recent speeches of Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax.

"Asahi Shimbun" expressed doubts about whether the Allied forces in the Far East fleet have expanded their activities to the extent of a blockade, and said that Japan must continue to strictly adhere to neutrality on the one hand and take various steps to protect the complete rights of neutral countries on the other.

<p>Maastricht: Yesterday, German forces continued their efforts to extend the Siegfried Line along the German border and the Limburg province of the Netherlands. According to reliable sources, Germany is extending the Siegfried Line along the Belgian-Dutch border. Although there is no blockade visible on the Limburg border, the movement of people living on the Dutch and German borders has long been restricted. People can only obtain permits from the Aelasha Bo Police Station, and these permits are only valid for twelve hours. German border officials have warned Germans traveling to the Netherlands to return to Germany before March 15. (United Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Informed sources in The Hague recently stated that German troops have been moving frequently along the Dutch border in the past 48 hours.

<p>The Hague: It is rumored that the borders between Germany and Belgium and the Netherlands will be closed starting tomorrow. Officials here recently stated that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not received any information sufficient to confirm this. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin: A spokesman for the German High Command stated yesterday in response to questions from foreign reporters that rumors about Germany constructing defenses near the Danish border are completely unfounded. The strength of Germany and Denmark is vastly different, and a non-aggression treaty was signed last year. Therefore, there is no need to mention border defenses. These rumors are likely due to labor service personnel in uniform building roads near the Danish border, leading to misunderstandings. It is also possible that rumors regarding the Netherlands were caused by the dredging of swamps. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e31">French Finance Minister Reports on Economic Situation: Reduce Consumption, Increase Production; Seek Ways to Eliminate the Crisis <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Paris: Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a radio address tonight, stating, "Up to now, Germany has imposed an economic war on us. Their offensive at sea is entirely aimed at cutting off supplies to Britain and France. It has been six months since the outbreak of the war. Our financial situation is very sound, but the crisis lies only in the economic aspect, especially the rise in prices and the increase in the cost of living. Everything is dominated by the following two facts: first, production has decreased compared to before the war, and second, consumption is equal to that before the war. This situation cannot be allowed to continue. The current solution is to consume material and financial resources, and to purchase goods from abroad with part of our gold reserves. Therefore, the amount of domestic gold reserves is decreasing day by day. However, since November of last year, prices have already begun to rise. If we try to cope by raising wages, the impact will only cause prices to continue to rise. This cycle will never end. France suffered enough from this after the last European war. How can we repeat the same mistake now? In view of this, the government has signed an order approving the agreement concluded between the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of France, and will use two funds to cope with domestic and foreign payments: (1) Regarding foreign payments, the government will use part of the war fund, but its use must be kept secret so that the enemy does not know. (2) Regarding domestic payments, the government will use its deposits in the Bank of France, and the price of the franc will not change at all, so that all kinds of situations caused by the war can be handled with ease. In addition, the various laws promulgated by the government are all economic remedies, which, in short, are only to limit consumption and increase production. Our country now maintains a linked relationship with Britain, and the government has also promulgated new laws to facilitate trade between the two countries, thereby enriching this relationship. The United States believes that the monetary and economic agreements between Britain and France are sufficient to form the seeds of a future European organization. This view is extremely correct, and their sympathy should be valued by us. However, the scope of implementation of the British-French agreement must continue to be expanded." Reynaud concluded by saying that the relationship between Britain and France has great strength, but there are still many difficulties ahead in the struggle, and we must preserve our strength as much as possible to succeed.

<p>Helsinki: The General Headquarters issued a war report stating: (1) On the Karelian front, the Red Army has launched a vigorous attack on our army's positions from Vyborg to Vuoksen. Our army was forced to retreat and move to new positions. In this battle, the Red Army lost 14 tanks. The Red Army also attacked our army's positions three times in the Taipale River area, but all failed. (2) On the Ladoga Lake front, the Red Army launched an attack on Pitkäranta, but was repelled by our army. (3) In the Gum district, our army occupied many Soviet positions and has cleared out the remaining enemy forces. (4) In the northern Petsamo port area, along the Nantsijoki River, our enemy forces also came into contact, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to a communiqué disclosed last night, the situation in Finland is now extremely serious. Finnish forces guarding Vyborg, the coastal side of the Mannerheim Line, have been forced to retreat under terrible pressure from Soviet forces. Although the Finnish army did not easily give up an inch of land and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy, it finally retreated along the line from the Gulf of Finland to Vuoksen. Finnish forces are still standing firm around Taipale. However, according to the opinion of military experts here, if the Soviet forces break through Vyborg, the Taipale area will be seriously threatened in the rear. Soviet forces now advancing towards Vyborg have control of three railway lines and four key roads leading to the city. The expected melting snow and heavy snowstorms that usually occur in February have not materialized to hinder the advance of the Soviet forces. The Finnish army now has no choice but to resist the incessant attacks of the vastly superior Soviet forces to the death. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to reports yesterday, the right wing of Finland's new defense line in Karelia is at Summa, 15 kilometers south of Vyborg. From there, through Aglajaärvi, Salmenkaita, towards Vuoksen, Soviet forces are attacking in three directions. The fighting on the Vyborg front is particularly fierce. Finnish forces are resisting stubbornly, using granite to stop Soviet tanks. Tank traps and air-raid shelters have been built in the forests of various positions. After breaking through the Finnish positions at Summa, the Soviet forces have launched a full-line attack on the new Finnish positions. Soviet forces at Taipale have been repelled. (Haitong, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: People here observed today that the occupation of Vyborg by the Red Army is purely a matter of time. Soviet forces are still using fierce artillery fire to destroy obstacles on the road. Regarding a peace agreement with the Soviet Union that requires territorial concessions, both the military and civilian sectors in Finland have expressed their inability to accept it. Although the Soviet forces have achieved victories in Karelia, the morale and spirit of the Finnish people are still very strong and show no signs of decline. (Associated Press, 1st)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to a communiqué from the headquarters of the Leningrad Military District, the Soviet offensive in Karelia continued to develop yesterday. We occupied Vyborg, the Valkeala-Kouvola railway, and the Alappia, Hangonki, and Pirola stations (9 kilometers east of Vyborg) on that line. At the same time, we also recaptured the town of Lauritsala and the summer recreation area on the east bank of Vyborg Bay, only 2 kilometers south of Vyborg. Also, on February 28th and 29th, Soviet forces captured a total of 270 enemy fortifications, including 66 artillery batteries (excluding the 42 mentioned in the February 28th communiqué). There were no other significant developments in other areas. The Soviet Air Force bombed enemy forces and enemy military targets, and shot down 36 enemy aircraft in air battles. (TASS, 1st)</p>

<p>If Mediation Succeeds, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden Will Mediate</p>
<p>London: Reuters diplomatic correspondents have learned from responsible neutral sources that there is a feeling that the Finnish war has now entered a dangerous phase and that several countries must reconsider their position to avoid future regrets. The only glimmer of hope is that Soviet forces have now reached the gates of Vyborg. The Soviet Union has already obtained most of the territorial concessions from Finland that it had previously demanded, except for Hanko. The Soviet Union should now be able to grant Finland a peace that preserves its independence. Since the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet war, Britain and France have never come forward to mediate. However, if there is a slight hope of successful mediation, the governments of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden are definitely prepared to come forward to mediate. When Soviet forces began to invade Finland, President Roosevelt made an effort to achieve a peaceful solution. It is now heard that the US President is sending Under Secretary of State Welles to Europe to test the chances of peace. What is being discussed is not only the war between Germany and the Allied Powers. On Tuesday, February 22nd, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and others met with the US Ambassador and staff in Moscow for three and a half hours. At that time, the United States had the opportunity to express its wishes. However, the US President may have to wait until Welles returns to Washington before indicating whether there is an atmosphere of overall peace restoration in Europe. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The "Uusi Suomi" newspaper here carried a report from Moscow that US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt recently held talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov for three and a half hours. According to responsible sources, the discussion was solely about the Finnish-Soviet war. It is heard that the US Ambassador has tried to find terms acceptable to Finland (that do not harm the country's independence) in order to end the war between the two countries. In addition, German Ambassador to the Soviet Union Schulenburg is also very active in Moscow. (Havas, 1st)</p>

<p>Oslo: Norwegian Foreign Minister Koht declared last night that Norway will re-engage with Berlin in the coming days regarding the sinking of Norwegian ships. The Nordic countries will support any protest raised as a result of this incident, and hope that other neutral countries will also support it. The warning issued by German semi-official sources that ships must not enter British territorial waters has nothing to do with international law. Norway must maintain its trade with Britain. Norwegian-British trade has always been large, and this has been the case since ancient times. During the war, Norway has lost 50 ships totaling 110,000 tons and 350 lives. It has now been proven that nine of them were sunk by the German side, and most of the rest sank after hitting mines. We do not want any contraband controls, and have already stated that controlling ships traveling to and from neutral ports violates international law, but Germany does not therefore have the right to sink Norwegian ships that are forced into controlled ports.

<p>London: Reuters diplomatic correspondents have learned from reliable sources in London that the diplomatic issues between Britain and Norway regarding the Altmark incident can now be considered to have lost their previous sharpness. Britain is currently considering its reply to Norway's recent note. The only point in dispute is the interpretation of the clause in the Hague Convention that warships of belligerent countries are allowed to pass through territorial waters. Norway believes that the Altmark was a warship and could freely pass through territorial waters, while the British authorities said that since the Altmark was carrying prisoners of war, its passage through territorial waters was an act of war and should not be allowed. For Norway's sake, it should have refused to pass through territorial waters or released the prisoners of war at the time. As for the Norwegian government's claim that it did not know that the ship was carrying prisoners of war, its words should be credible. However, the Norwegian government's suggestion to submit the matter to arbitration would create difficult-to-solve problems from the British point of view. (Reuters, 1st)</p>

We are fighting a war for the sake of our motherland, which has been forced to do so, in accordance with international law. Five years ago today, the world knew that Germany had an Air Force. All the achievements in recent years are due to the concerted efforts of all the soldiers. Since Chancellor Hitler ordered the protection of the country, you have proven that you are heroes in the air, whether in war or in peace. In addition to the Air Force soldiers, I also express my gratitude to the air defense teams and air force intelligence personnel. In addition, I pay infinite respect to the martyred soldiers. We should inherit the spirit of the martyred soldiers and continue to fight to win the final victory. Heil Hitler! Air Minister Göring (sealed), 1st" (Haitong, 1st)</p>

<p>Tokyo - At a meeting of the subcommittee of the House of Representatives Budget Committee yesterday, Democratic Party member Nakajima and Seiyukai Kuhara faction member Ishizaka both made proposals, stating in brief that since the next fiscal year's budget no longer includes funds for the "Manchurian" Incident, the various agencies established by the cabinet to handle "Manchurian" affairs should be merged into the Colonial Affairs Ministry. Social Mass Party member Tahara advocated merging the Asia Development Board, the "Manchuria" Affairs Bureau, and the Colonial Affairs Ministry into one, tentatively named the East Asia Ministry. Colonial Affairs Minister General Koiso immediately replied that the "Manchuria" Affairs Bureau would likely be merged into the Colonial Affairs Ministry in the near future. As this matter concerns the Kwantung Army and other departments, opinions are being exchanged, and it will take some time to reach a consensus. As for the merger of the Asia Development Board, it will be discussed after the conclusion of the "China Incident." At this point, Shih Chüeh T'ung Chih Hui (Current Situation Comrades Association) member Ishizaka asked about the government's southward advance policy. General Koiso replied that the government hopes to use Taiwan and the Pacific mandate islands as bases to develop the economy peacefully in Thailand, the Malay Peninsula, the Dutch East Indies, and the South Sea Islands. To promote this policy, the government plans to first establish a large-scale research agency and then train personnel to engage in this development work. Regarding the issue of immigration to "Manchuria," the area of uncultivated land in "Manchuria" is very large, of which 80% is in northern Manchuria, which the government attaches great importance to. Democratic Party member Sakurai then asked if it was true that the Japanese government had suggested to the Dutch government the establishment of a non-aggression pact, but was rejected by the Netherlands. Minister Koiso replied that he was unaware of this matter. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<p>New York - Mr. Pond, an American carpet industry magnate, recently traveled in China for three months and moved his carpet factory in Tianjin to Shanghai. Having traveled no less than three thousand miles, he has now returned here. According to his remarks, American businessmen in China are currently encountering major difficulties. "We have moved our factory out of Tianjin, and it is likely that many others will follow suit. For the Japanese, who will soon be able to monopolize the market, this is naturally a cause for celebration. In short, American businessmen in China hope that their government will not only abolish the commercial treaty with Japan but also take further action. These people are eager for the government to take new steps, namely, to completely ban any goods that could assist Japan," he said. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3 id="e62">Public Buses Still on Strike Yesterday; All Parties Seek Solutions; Shanghai Municipal Council Mediates, Yu Qiaqing Negotiates; Labor and Management Seemingly Should Coordinate Early; Company Hired White Russians Yesterday to Resume Routes 19 and 2 <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>After all the vehicle and machinery workers of the British-owned China General Omnibus Company went on strike the day before yesterday morning due to their demands for improved treatment not being met, the company immediately convened a board meeting. Starting yesterday morning, they hired White Russians to resume operating buses on routes 1, 9, and 2, and invited the press to report on the situation. Yesterday, the workers held a general meeting and established the Third District Public Bus Workers United Benefit Association. The Italian soldiers who were stationed in front of the factory gate have completely withdrawn. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Company Convenes Board Meeting</p>
<p>In order to quickly resolve the labor dispute, the China General Omnibus Company, in addition to inviting General Manager Xiao Tuo the day before yesterday to convene Xie Annuoqiongsi and Transportation Manager Zhang Delan to discuss countermeasures, also convened a company board meeting at 2 PM the day before yesterday in the main office of the Sassoon House. First, General Manager Xiao Tuo reported on the workers' demands and the course of the strike. The conditions proposed by the workers were discussed in detail, but the content was not announced. A written reply to the workers was scheduled for three days later. As for maintaining public transport, a resolution was made to make every effort to proceed.</p>
<p>Routes One and Nine Resume Operation</p>
<p>For the sake of maintaining transportation, the company resumed operations of routes 1 and 9 yesterday morning. Route 1 operated fifteen vehicles (double-decker), running from Zhaofeng Park via Yuyuan Road, Jing'an Temple Road, to the Bund on Nanjing Road. Route 9 operated thirteen vehicles (single-decker), running from Zhaofeng Park via Yuyuan Road, Fuxi Road, Avenue Edward VII, to the Bund on Beijing Road. All drivers and ticket sellers were White Russians and Western staff of the company. A Chinese constable (two for double-deckers) was dispatched by the police to provide protection. However, because the ticket sellers were not familiar with the fares for each stop, all passengers were charged 20 cents, regardless of distance. A sign was posted on the bus stating "Any Distance 20 Cents."</p>
<p>Briefing the Press on the Situation</p>
<p>Company General Manager Xiao Tuo hosted a briefing for the Chinese and foreign press at his residence on Connaught Road at 3 PM yesterday to report on the recent labor dispute. He stated briefly that after the company's mechanics raised demands for improved treatment at 4 PM on the 28th, the company agreed to provide each person with a rice subsidy of $8.41 per month starting from February. Starting in March, the company would also organize the sale of rice at subsidized prices. However, the mechanics were not satisfied. The mechanics on the early shift refused to leave the factory and made eight demands to the company. Because the company needed time to consider, it could not reply immediately. At that time, the mechanics on the night shift had already arrived at the factory to work. The early shift workers, in addition to preventing the night shift from working, also removed the refueling machine in the factory, causing the situation to gradually become serious. The next morning, after the vehicle department workers arrived at the factory, they also joined the mechanics in stopping work and made thirteen demands. After the police learned of this, they dispatched detectives to the factory to maintain order and invited Italian defense forces to jointly maintain order. That afternoon, the Italian soldiers, in order to protect the company's property and maintain public order, drove the workers out of the factory. The company was forced to do this, which it deeply regrets. However, the company has always treated the workers extremely well and has not experienced any accidents in the past eight years. This sudden strike by the mechanics is very puzzling.</p>
<p>Workers Present Thirteen Demands</p>
<p>The thirty conditions jointly presented by the vehicle and machinery workers are as follows: (1) Due to the difficulty of living, we demand an increase in treatment, with a 40% increase in monthly salary. (2) Each worker demands an increase in rice subsidy, in addition to the original 25 cents per person per day, add another 25 cents per person per day, totaling 50 cents per person per day. (3) We request that the company jointly organize subsidized rice sales. If this can be realized, the workers will automatically cancel the above rice subsidy per day, but the price of subsidized rice must not exceed $20 per picul. (4) We request that the year-end bonus should still follow the old rules, and 24 work holidays should also follow the old rules, with a rest every Sunday. (5) We request that the company provide all workers with preferential treatment and free rides. (6) We request that the company provide compensation for workers who are injured or killed on duty during work hours. (7) We request that temporary workers who have worked for more than six months should be changed to permanent workers. (8) Ticket sellers, doormen, and drivers should all have a subsidy of a dollar. (9) Restore the year-end salary of one month, regardless of seniority, as a reward. (10) Working hours should not exceed eight hours per day. (11) Workers should not be dismissed without cause. (12) The $15 borrowed by new workers at the end of 1939 should be subsidized and not repaid. (13) Wages should be paid as usual during the strike.</p>
<p>Italian Soldiers Withdraw, Authorities Mediate</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency made a special trip to inspect the front of the company's gate at 1171 Connaught Road yesterday and learned that the Italian soldiers stationed there had completely withdrawn the night before last and were replaced by detectives dispatched by the police to protect the site. Two police cars were parked on the road in front of the gate. As for the thirteen workers who were injured by the tear gas released by the Italian soldiers the day before, they are still being treated in the hospital. Most of them are not in life-threatening condition. The striking workers are strictly maintaining order and have not taken any excessive actions. There are no striking workers in front of the company gate. In addition to dispatching the Political Department to investigate, the Shanghai Municipal Council also sent Bing Yuan from the Industrial Section yesterday to find ways to mediate.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Appointed as Mediator</p>
<p>Yesterday around 5 PM, Shanghai celebrity Yu Qiaqing stepped forward to mediate, using the following three conditions: (1) Increase wages by 40%; (2) Increase rice subsidies by a certain amount; (3) Coppersmiths are allowed to ride the company's public buses for free. It is heard that the company's compradore Xiao Tuo has agreed to consider it and will reply at 9 AM today.</p>
<p>Driver Arrested, Still Not Released</p>
<p>At about 3 PM yesterday, a driver of the company's No. 133 bus was suddenly arrested by Chinese police in front of the Westward Gate of the Jing'an Temple on Jing'an Temple Road. As of the time of publication, there was still no news of his release.</p>
<p>Striking Workers Hold General Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The striking vehicle and machinery workers held a meeting at 2:30 PM yesterday on Yuyuan Road. In addition to expressing condolences to the injured workers, they were very angry about the actions of the Italian soldiers. They immediately established the Third District Public Bus Workers United Benefit Association and elected representatives to petition for assistance. In addition, they also elected representatives to negotiate with the company.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Controlling Citywide Prices; Two Settlements Will Cooperate <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council, noting that the French Concession Municipal Council has a committee to control prices, which has a significant impact on stabilizing people's livelihoods and maintaining public order, is also following the French Concession Municipal Council by establishing a price research subcommittee. Fei Si Tuo, Hong Ke, and Mei Luo have been appointed as committee members to study prices, determine price levels, and stabilize the market. This move by the Shanghai Municipal Council has been unanimously supported by the citizens.</p>
<p>It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors is considering a definite price order for price control within the settlement, and then coordinating with the French Concession authorities in order to implement it. The French Concession Municipal Council, at the end of February, was convened by French Consul General Bao Daizhi, with Consul Oqi also attending the meeting. The measures will be announced soon.</p>
<p>As for the subcommittee established by the Shanghai Municipal Council, it is also scheduled to convene for discussions within days. The Mainland News also reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to organize a subcommittee to study methods for controlling prices in order to alleviate the people's difficulties. Although it is considered "too late," the general public still welcomes it. It is said that the authorities of the Public Settlement and the French Concession are cooperating with each other to control prices, and there is great hope that speculators who manipulate prices for profit will restrain themselves. However, Chinese people in the city are somewhat disappointed that no Chinese people have been appointed to the subcommittee.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Agreement Signed on Police Authority North of the Suzhou Creek; New Police District Established, Headed by a Japanese; Existing Restrictions by the Japanese Side to Be Lifted as Much as Possible <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the restoration of full Shanghai Municipal Council police authority in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, the Shanghai Municipal Council has long been negotiating with the Japanese authorities. This negotiation was once suspended in August of last year, but has now come to a conclusion and an agreement has been signed. The agreement stipulates that police authority in the area north of the Suzhou Creek will be returned to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and a new police district will be established in the area, headed by a Japanese person. The above agreement was formally signed by the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors and the Japanese Consul General. The full text of the agreement is published as follows:</p>
<p>The Full Text of the Agreement is Divided into Three Sections</p>
<p>A. (1) A new police district will be established in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, named Police District "E." The jurisdiction of Police District "E" is the portion marked "Proposal of the Head of the Police Department" in the attached map. The candidate for the head of Police District "E" will be recommended by the Japanese authorities and appointed by the Shanghai Municipal Council on a trial basis. After a trial period of six months, if the Municipal Council deems him satisfactory, he will be formally appointed as the head of Police District "E." (2) An assistant district head will be established for Police Districts "C" and "D." The candidates will be recommended by the Japanese authorities and appointed by the Shanghai Municipal Council. (3) Japanese police officers who are deemed capable of managing the affairs of the Dixwell Road and Xing Road police stations within Police District "E" may serve under the direction of experienced Western police officers for several months in order to become familiar with the work to be handled. After four to six months, they may be appointed as chief inspectors of the above two police stations. Japanese police officers who are competent and available for deployment may also be assigned to the positions of trial officers in the police stations within Police Districts "C" and "D." (4) The employment of Japanese police officers to manage the affairs of police stations other than Police District "E" will be considered in the future, depending on the situation and the number of police officers.</p>
<p>B. The special deputy superintendent of the Police Department should, based on his special abilities, serve as the direct advisor to the superintendent in all aspects of police affairs, and his authority is second only to the superintendent and the acting superintendent appointed during the superintendent's illness or leave of absence.</p>
<p>C. In order to ensure the smooth and harmonious implementation of police authority in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, representatives from the Japanese Consulate General, the Japanese Army and Navy, and the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department should hold meetings.</p>
<p>Japanese Restrictions to Be Lifted as Much as Possible</p>
<p>One point to be noted is that Gao Shi once sent a letter to the Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors on December 10, 1938, stating that the Japanese authorities should continue to find ways to lift various existing restrictions as quickly as possible. Therefore, it is hoped that this layer can be realized as soon as possible in order to conform to the original intention of the Shanghai Municipal Council during the negotiations.</p>
<p>Both Parties Signed Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>At 3 PM yesterday, both parties held a signing ceremony at the Japanese Consulate General. Fan Keling, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors, Fei Lipu, Director-General, Bao En, Superintendent, Chimu, Deputy Superintendent, and Miura, Japanese Consul General, Tsurumi, Director of Intelligence, Lieutenant Colonel Utsunomiya, and Lieutenant Commander Kawabata attended. After reviewing the full text of the new agreement, they signed it in sequence. At this point, the area north of the Suzhou Creek, which had been guarded by the Japanese Navy since the Incident, was finally resolved and returned to the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council police authority.</p>
<p>Japanese Police Chief on Six-Month Trial</p>
<p>The most noteworthy part of the agreement is the establishment of Police District E, which places part of the Jiading Road Dixwell Road Police Station and Hongkou Police Management Area, which were previously in the Western District, under its jurisdiction, and places a Japanese chief in charge. However, within six months of the implementation of the handover of police authority, it is a training period for the district chief. If the Shanghai Municipal Council deems him satisfactory after the full term, he will be formally appointed.</p>
<p>Japanese Consul General Issues Statement</p>
<p>The authorities of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai issued a statement after the agreement was signed yesterday, briefly stating that this result began with the outline decided by the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities in August of last year, and so on. As for the point stipulated in the agreement that the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, the Japanese Consulate General, and representatives of the Japanese Army and Navy should hold meetings in order to ensure the smooth and harmonious implementation of police authority in the area, it is reported that they will continue to hold meetings soon.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Coal Industry Association, the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association, and the Shanghai Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association jointly announced that, "In order to benefit the common people, the members of the Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association, namely Yi Tai Xing, Nanyang, Guohua, Dongfang, Jinghua, Guanghua, Huacheng Cuiji, Yuedong, Yuanhua, Nanfang Changji, Hu Licheng, Heji, Yan Yan, and Beiyang, fourteen factories in total, are enthusiastically supplying 1,000 loads of coal balls per day for sale at low prices, and the three associations will assist in handling the sales.

(C) Each two jiao purchases four city jin of coal balls. (D) Pay first, then weigh the coal balls. (E) The period of low-price sales is tentatively set from March 2nd to March 21st."</p>
<p>Sales Methods</p>
<p>Last month's low-price sales of coal balls failed to benefit the common people widely, so the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce invited the coal industry, coal ball industry, and firewood and charcoal industry to organize a low-price coal ball sales committee to discuss the sales methods. It was decided to start today. The methods are recorded as follows: (1) Fifteen member factories of the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association will sell 20,000 loads at low prices during the 20-day low-price period, which is 1,000 loads per day (a separate list of the fifteen member factories is provided). (2) A low-price committee will be established to handle all affairs, and its members will be selected by the relevant associations. The committee will be composed of four people from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, five people from the Coal Ball Industry Association, three people from the Coal Industry Association, and three people from the Firewood and Charcoal Industry Association. (3) The meeting dates will be determined at any time, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce will be designated as the convener. The location will be the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. (4) Twenty-six locations throughout the city will be designated for the exclusive sale of low-price coal balls. The low-price committee will issue city signs to these locations, designated as "Shanghai Coal Ball Low-Price Committee Coal Ball Low-Price Location No. 〇" for identification. (5) The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce will send a letter to the police authorities of the two settlements, requesting them to maintain order at the locations during the low-price sales period. (6) Each person is limited to purchasing two jiao worth of coins. (7) Each two jiao purchases four city jin of coal balls. (8) Coal balls will be sold from 2 PM every day until they are sold out. (9) Pay first, then receive the coal balls. (10) Each factory responsible for the sales will be responsible for the quality of the low-price goods. (11) Representatives selected by each association will be present every day to supervise the sales in order to ensure reputation. (12) The current round of low-price sales is tentatively set for 20 days. If we receive sympathy from enthusiastic philanthropists and are willing to provide assistance, we can consider extending the period, and the methods will be determined later.</p>
<p>Sales Locations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Coal Ball Association sent a letter to all coal ball factories, stating that "Regarding the case of exempting warehouse rent for the low-price sale of coal balls, our association has jointly discussed with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Coal Ball and Firewood and Charcoal Associations, and the results are as follows: (1) The low-price sale period is approved from the 2nd to the 21st of this month. (2) Warehouse receipts issued from March 2nd to March 15th for goods leaving the factory will be exempt from warehouse rent. (3) Warehouse rent that has already been paid will not be refunded." The above resolutions are approved. Correspondingly, we are sending this letter to inform you, and we have attached a copy of the low-price coal ball sales methods and a list of sales locations. We hope that your factory will examine and receive it, and send the quantity you previously acknowledged directly to the locations listed in the low-price sales location list before 2 PM every day starting from the 2nd of this month. We are very grateful. The list of low-price sales locations stipulated by the Coal Ball Association is as follows:</p>

<p>Regarding the French Consulate's visa for German goods shipped to Vietnam before the outbreak of the European war, there are still many cases where the deadline was too short and the procedures could not be completed. According to reliable sources, the Shanghai China-France Express Transportation Company has negotiated with the Vietnam Tokyo Chinese Chamber of Commerce and obtained permission from the French authorities to apply for supplementary visas. Merchants who failed to apply for visas last time and hold valid documents such as full payment certificates before September 3rd of last year can go to the company to negotiate the procedures. After completing the visa application, the company will send it to the Vietnam Tokyo Chinese Chamber of Commerce on their behalf, which will then forward it to the General Consulate of France in Indochina, which will then forward it to the French Embassy in Paris. After the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs reviews and approves it, the German goods detained in Vietnam can be released. Therefore, the large number of German goods detained in Vietnam is not a problem.</p>

<h3 id="e68">Unbearable Increase in Taxes and Levies; Please Negotiate with the Ratepayers' Association; Raising Levies at This Time Endangers the Market; Balancing Revenue and Expenditure Lies in Cutting Wasteful Expenses <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council announced its intention to increase municipal general tax, special house tax, and land tax surcharges by 50% starting on July 1 this year, the public has been alarmed. The district branches of the First Special District Citizens' Federation jointly sent a letter to the General Federation yesterday, stating, "We have recently learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council is planning to increase the municipal general tax, special house tax, and land tax surcharges by 50% starting on July 1 this year in order to make up for increased expenses. Upon hearing this news, the residents within the settlement are all in a state of panic. Since the outbreak of the war, the population of this city has become concentrated, and all goods have become expensive. Although industry and commerce appear to be prosperous on the surface, in reality, this prosperity is entirely consumer-driven and cannot last. Most of the citizens are from the war zones and have been here for nearly three years. Their economic capabilities are gradually being depleted. At a time when prices are soaring, their livelihoods are already under serious threat. Therefore, raising levies at this time will only deepen the market crisis. If the Shanghai Municipal Council claims that the market is improving and that most salaried employees have received salary increases or subsidies, such salary increases are merely a drop in the bucket and cannot compensate for the increased expenses due to the high prices. Therefore, we hope that the Shanghai Municipal Council will abandon the proposed increase in levies at this time when people's livelihoods are declining. The way to remedy the situation is to pay as much attention as possible to cutting wasteful expenses in order to balance revenue and expenditure. We are therefore sending this letter to request that your association and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association forward a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, urging them to negotiate and prevent the levy increase from becoming a reality. This will benefit the citizens and the market."</p>

<p>According to the Mainland News, Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire shipping companies have announced that freight rates for coastal ports served by their ships will increase by 5 to 10 Hong Kong dollars starting on March 1. The increase is greater for routes to South China and smaller for routes to North China. The freight rates of these two companies were already increased by 10% to 20% three weeks ago. According to the Shanghai Java Shipping Company, the fares for its ships will now be calculated in guilders, and freight rates will also be converted into foreign currencies.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Chinese Crew Members of Sunken German Warship Arrive in Shanghai, Discussing the Terrifying Scene of the Naval Battle; Three British Cruisers Fired Shells Side by Side; Half a Stack of Shirts in the Laundry Room Was Blown Away <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, the German pocket battleship Graf Spee was scuttled off the coast of Uruguay in South America. There were six Chinese crew members on board, who were responsible for laundry work. They recently arrived in Shanghai on the Italian mail ship Conte Biancamano. They discussed the battle between the Graf Spee and the British cruisers HMS Exeter, HMS Ajax, and HMS Achilles. They said that they were hiding in the ship's laundry room at the time and did not see the battle very clearly, but they heard loud cannon fire, which was quite terrifying. Then, a shell entered the cabin and continued to fly to the opposite side. They left the laundry room and went to the infirmary to take shelter. The reason why the Graf Spee was discovered by the British ships was that the reconnaissance aircraft it was carrying could not take off to search for enemy ships. The Graf Spee had no choice but to wander around on its own. When the lookouts on the Graf Spee spotted the British cruisers, they mistakenly thought they were merchant ships. It was not until the British ships began firing eight-inch shells in succession near the Graf Spee that everyone on board was greatly shocked and tried to escape while opening eleven-inch broadsides on the British ships to defend themselves.</p>
<p>The two sides chased and bombarded each other for about three and a half hours before the Graf Spee finally entered the port of Montevideo in Uruguay. One of the Chinese, who had peeked at the battle, said that the largest of the three British cruisers attacked in the center, while the other two assisted on the left and right sides. None of the six men were injured, but one of them was storing shirts in the laundry room when a shell entered, hitting him in the face and blowing away half a stack of shirts, causing him great shock. It is understood that there were 425 Chinese sailors on the Conte Biancamano who had worked on German ships that were scuttled or detained in neutral ports. It is estimated that at least 2,000 Chinese sailors working on German ships have lost their jobs as a result. Most of those who arrived in Shanghai on the Italian mail ship had worked on the German ships Anatol, Gasira, Mecklenburg, and Frankfurt. These four ships have now been detained in South American ports.</p>
<h3 id="e72">工部局本年度預算　敎育費 <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the draft budget of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Education Department for this year, all the listed amounts have been discussed and reduced to the lowest possible level by the heads of the Finance and Education Departments and submitted to the Education Committee's regular meeting on February 2nd for review.</p>
<p>A. Temporary Expenditure Items: The important expenses under the temporary expenditure items include (1) the planned construction of a Chinese primary school for 300 students at the corner of Kiaochow Road and Singapore Road, costing 33,000 yuan. After amendment, this amount was increased to 40,000 yuan, and it was approved. (2) The proposed construction of a bicycle shed at the Western District Western Children's Public School and another bicycle shed at the Chinese Girls' Middle School, as well as lengthening the surrounding walls, with a total cost of 6,100 yuan. It was decided that the above two bicycle shed projects would be postponed until next year. (3) The internal renovation and painting of the Western District Western Children's Public School, as well as the relocation and reinstallation of a steam boiler, were approved with an engineering fee of 1,200 yuan. Also, the construction of a covered walkway at the Yu Yuen Road Western Girls' School was approved with an engineering fee of 200 yuan. (4) An expense of 100 yuan was listed in the budget for the construction of a library at the Kunning Road Chinese Primary School. (5) 1,600 yuan for miscellaneous engineering fees for Western Children's Schools and 1,500 yuan for miscellaneous engineering fees for Chinese Schools were both approved.</p>
<p>B. Regular Expenditure Items: According to the report of the Head of the Finance Department, the draft of the Education Department's regular expenses has been carefully reviewed and discussed with the Head of the Education Department. According to the list in the draft, 14,990 yuan has been added, so the total regular expenses are listed as 3,157,190 yuan, which is 817,270 yuan more than last year. The detailed comparison is as follows:</p>
<p>The reasons for the increase in the above expenses are nothing more than the high prices of various supplies and the increase in subsidies for teachers and staff. The subsidies for Western and Chinese private schools have been increased by 25% compared to last year. However, this is experimental and cannot be considered a fixed amount. There will be another report in the future.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Head of the Finance Department, the total amount of educational funding was previously stipulated not to exceed 2% of the total donation and land tax rate. The education budget last year was 1.84%. However, due to a sharp increase in expenditure, a total of 2,672,000 yuan was allocated, which met the 2% donation rate. However, the deficit still reached 30,150 yuan, and the deficit for this year is estimated to be 468,340 yuan. Whether this deficit should be carried over to the next year should be decided by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The total tuition fee for this year is estimated to be 643,130 yuan, of which 289,450 yuan is from Western schools and 353,680 yuan is from Chinese schools. The Head of the Finance Department, in view of the sharp increase in the cost of various schools, will propose to increase the surcharge on tuition fees for Western and Chinese schools to 50% and 30%, respectively, to make up for the deficit.</p>
<p>At that time, a committee member said that when the total donation rate was 14%, the education funding was stipulated to be 2% of the donation. However, now that the total donation rate has increased to 18%, the ratio of education funding has not changed. In this case, the tuition fee surcharge should be increased, or some schools should be closed. Another committee member believed that the above restriction system had many obstacles to the promotion of education, and that it was difficult to maintain the continuous increase in expenditure. Therefore, this year's education budget cannot be said to be huge, nor can it be reduced. Another committee member said that if half a percent of the total donation is allocated this year, the estimated deficit this year can be offset, and the ratio of education funding should be increased simultaneously with the total donation rate to meet the needs.</p>
<p>The above provisional budget has been approved by the Education Committee and submitted to the Finance Committee for review. The committee members finally decided to recommend to the Bureau that, considering the maintenance of education work during the extraordinary period, all the previous restrictions on educational funding should be lifted.</p>

<p>Request to ban gambling dens in Nantao, iron gates will be closed, French authorities will take decisive action</p>
<p>Since the opening of iron gates in various places such as Nanyang Bridge and Xieqiao, which are connected to the French Concession and Nantao, a group of profit-seeking people thought they had an opportunity and have been seeking houses in the Nantao area to open gambling dens. At present, more than a dozen small gambling dens are ready to open or have already opened. The French Concession authorities and the Nantao Refugee Area General Office believe that the opening of these gambling dens not only induces people to lose their time and jobs and go bankrupt, but also hinders public security. It is reported that the French Consul and Father Rao, the director of the General Office, Gu Lun, sent a letter to the so-called "Nantao District Government" yesterday, requesting that the opening of gambling dens be banned. It is also reported that the French authorities have stated that if the Nantao gambling dens continue to exist, the French Concession will take decisive action to maintain public security, and all the opened iron gates may be forced to close again. At that time, even if citizens hold "citizen certificates", they will be prohibited from passing.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning in Zhaojiadu, bandits resisted arrest</p>
<p>At 2:15 a.m. yesterday morning, 5 or 6 bandits suddenly arrived at Jida Pawnshop No. 259, Wujiaochang, Zhaojiadu. Three of the bandits, holding Mauser pistols, pried open the back door of the pawnshop, broke into the upstairs of the pawnshop, and looted wildly. As a result, thousands of yuan were looted. At that time, a shop assistant, Mr. Jia, heard the alarm and immediately pressed the alarm bell, then ran to the upstairs window, shouting for help, and blowing the police whistle. The bandits heard this and knew that the incident had been exposed, but they were unwilling to give up and fired four shots at the shop assistant. Fortunately, the shop assistant was alert and was not hit by the bullets. At that time, the Jing'an Temple Police Station heard the news and immediately sent dozens of Chinese and Western detectives to encircle and suppress the bandits. The bandits knew that the situation was not good, so they quickly took steps to escape, firing several shots at the detectives. The detectives immediately drew their guns and chased after them. Later, the bandits fled into the lane of the Xiang Sheng gambling den. When the pseudo-"Bureau" heard the news, it also sent a large number of pseudo-"police" to the scene. It is reported that the police station is paying close attention to this case and is still investigating it closely.</p>

<p>Japanese and puppet personnel threatened and extorted money, a woman filed a private prosecution</p>
<p>A woman, He Li, who has been setting up a fish stall in the Hongkou Xiaocai Market, previously filed a private prosecution in the special court against Bao Le and Ruan Wangyu, Shang Lianqing, etc., women in the same industry, for threatening and extorting money. The complaint stated briefly that, due to the jealousy of his counterpart Le, a design to frame, at nine o'clock in the morning on October 17 last year, accompanied by Ruan Zhou and two unknown Chinese and Japanese people, falsely accused the plaintiff of owing him 1,560 yuan, and handcuffed Ms. He to a certain consulate, illegally assaulted, and demanded money. He was detained at 11 o'clock, and then the defendants escorted him to the Hongkou Xiaocai Market, forcing Wang Changkang, the owner of a small money house in the same vegetable market, to borrow 200 yuan to pay. The rest was guaranteed by Lu Ajin, who was entrusted by the plaintiff. Unexpectedly, at 11 o'clock the next morning, the defendant gathered many people to demand 360 yuan without success, and was still escorted to the consulate for detention. Fortunately, relatives and friends hired a Japanese lawyer to rescue him and reported to the Hongkou Police Station, instructing him to file a private prosecution. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit. After the special court conducted a trial, it was ordered to stop the trial due to civil litigation. Now, He Li has hired lawyer Wang Yaotang to apply for a retrial. Jiang Tuishi summoned him the morning before, but because Lu Ajin, who was wanted as a witness, did not arrive, he ordered him to wait for another date for verification.</p>

<p>連同同黨併案訊辦　偵查未終改期再訊</p>
<p>The accomplice was also interrogated in the same case. The investigation was not over, and the hearing was postponed.</p>
<p>Zai Xinbei Goods Store, 52A Yangxing Street, French Concession, has a thriving business. Shareholder Zheng Heting hired Zheng Geng as accountant. Recently, Zheng Shan geng entered the gambling dens in West Shanghai and had a huge loss. On February 2nd, he conspired with Zhang Minghong and Shen Wenkui, two apprentices in the store, to embezzle more than 17,000 yuan of accounts, and deposited 10,000 yuan of cash in the Si Hang Savings Association under the pseudonym Wang Hengjiu. He then fled to Ningbo, his hometown. When the manager found out about it, he often reported to the French Police Station, and Detective Shen Lianfang arrested the students Zhang Shen er and brought them to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court for trial. Sun Tuishi was in charge of the trial. According to the confessions of Zhang and Shen, the police also arrested two accomplices, Shen Baokang and Yu Chuangen, and tried them together. However, the main culprit, Zheng Shanzeng, was still at large. Recently, the police learned that he was hiding in Jiangbei and sent someone to lure him to Shanghai and then arrest him. Yesterday morning, he and the other defendants were brought to the same case. Fei Xizhen, the lawyer of the police station, requested the court to postpone the trial because the investigation was not over. Zheng Shanzeng confessed to the embezzlement. All the embezzled money, except for 10,000 yuan deposited in the Si Hang Savings Association, the remaining 7,000 yuan has been lost. After questioning each defendant, the court ordered that the retrial be held on the 6th of the month. Each defendant was selected and defended. The lawyer's request for bail was rejected.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:15, a tragic bridge collapse and injury occurred in Tiandengtou, Gaoqiao Town, Pudong. A "public bus" belonging to the so-called "Public Works Bureau" fell into the river and was damaged, injuring several women and children on the spot. The Jiangsu Maru, a Gaoqiao bus of the Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company, carried passengers from the Beijing Road Pier back to Pudong at 3 pm yesterday. Arriving in Gaoqiao at about 4 pm, more than 100 passengers landed, of whom more than 40 took a public bus to Gaoqiao Town. When driving to the No. 1 Datong Bridge on the Gaoqiao Highway, there was a sudden crash,</p>
<p>The bridge body was interrupted</p>
<p>Collapsed, the rear half of the public bus fell into the river, the two rear wheels were in the water, and the front of the car was stranded on the bridge foot. All the passengers fell completely into the rear half of the car body, pressing on each other and unable to move. At that time, a passenger kicked through the glass window, and the passengers climbed out of the rear window one by one. At that time, there were two pseudo-police chiefs, a woman, and a boy over ten years old, who were all injured and were rescued to Gaoqiao for treatment. There was also a boy over twelve years old who was more seriously injured, breathless and unconscious, and was hugged to the Jiangsu Maru by everyone.</p>
<p>Try to rescue</p>
<p>Gradually waking up, the children and others started the Jiangsu Maru and gathered 51.7 yuan in French currency, which was sent to the hospital in Shanghai for treatment. The children were cyanotic and had a severe condition. It is not yet known whether they can preserve their lives. It is said that Datong Bridge was repaired once last year, because the local "District Office" did not pay the workers' wages. When the bridge was found to be in a dangerous condition this year, workers were recruited to repair it, but no one was willing to contract the work, which led to the tragedy. A "public bus" was also severely damaged and cannot be driven.</p>

<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchanges was relatively calm, because HSBC was still willing to maintain the current four shillings and one and two five. Initially, the sharp contraction of the US-British exchange rate abroad caused the market to open with a flat British and tight American image. The price was four shillings and one and two five and six yuan seven one eight seven five. Subsequently, China Merchants Bank and other banks climbed into the shilling and a Chinese bank bought and sold April futures on behalf of Hong Kong, and the foreign trade community also climbed up slightly. However, Xin HSBC was willing to supply the current shilling as much as possible, so other foreign firms were willing to spit it back, which stabilized the market. The flag was slightly reduced due to the wind, and the goal was to sell continuously. At this time, the currency exchange also issued some US dollar bills, which led to the US exchange rate once reaching six yuan and seventy-five. Finally, because the non-sick industry came back to buy, it immediately subsided like a Sichuan dog barking at the sun. The transaction was sparse at noon, and the situation was very quiet. Until the afternoon closing, the spot prices were all flat, and the futures softened darkly. In the afternoon, both buyers and sellers hesitated, and the market was silent. There was no change. By the evening closing, it was still the same as the morning opening, resulting in a 03125 British-American tight compared to yesterday.

<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big streak, the recent long 0625, the speed period has not changed, the New York silver price is still flat, London raw gold is stable, and the exchange rate of British to American, Shanghai, French and other exchanges are flat. The US to British is reduced by two points, the Shanghai to French is down by one cent, and the French to British is down by one cent and one two five. The central listed exchanges are as before, and the bank opened the spot selling price in the morning. British gold is four shillings and one two five, and the US exchange rate is six yuan seven eight seven five. Compared with the previous closing, British is flat and American is tight three one two five, which is due to the reduction of the exchange rate by two points. After opening, a certain bank in North China did not climb into the spot shilling, but HSBC was quite willing to supply it, and the price was four shillings one two five. After a while, a certain Chinese bank was suddenly entrusted by Hong Kong to climb into April futures for both British and American gold. The price was four shillings and six yuan half, which were supplied by Youli. The supply and demand were evenly matched, and there was no change. The HSBC listing was announced without moving, and the silver balancing tax was announced at 025. After that, foreign firms also came to settle in HSBC's spot British gold at four shillings and one two five, and then Taiyeli and other foreign firms bought spot exchange at six yuan seven one eight seven five. At that time, Youli's stomach was still good, so the US exchange rate once returned to six yuan seventy-five. It is estimated that a certain bank could give the same industry a spot US exchange rate of six yuan seventy-five. At the same time, the currency exchange industry did not give foreign firms US dollar bills at six yuan eighty one two five. Then, because the foreign industry had some cotton settlement, it came back to buy, which caused the US exchange rate to return to flatness immediately. After that, buying and selling were cautious, and the state suddenly became calm. Until the afternoon closing, there was no change. British gold was still standing still at four shillings one two five, and the US exchange rate was still six yuan seven one eight seven five. The forward four-month futures were slightly tight and soft, and the price was four shillings and six yuan four six eight seven five.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Multi-Party Affected by Tight Credit, Gold Market Wants to Rise But Stops, Fluctuation Range Also Narrows, Daily Trading Volume About 2,000 Taels <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash red dark market conditions, although the US dollar slightly showed weakness, gold prices did not show much color, mainly because the fundamental reason is still tight credit. This point greatly restricts the power of multi-party activities, so most long positions do not hold their positions for long, and they are very willing to close out with a small profit at any time. Moreover, the Hong Kong firms' demand is sluggish, resulting in a slight decline in the end. In terms of immediate crystal conditions, the opening in the morning was quite flat, at 4,860 yuan. Then, a certain gold shop's barge customer bought in, pulling it up by 10 yuan. Subsequently, securities firms suddenly competed to buy, and at that time the US dollar reported firm, so it was pushed down slightly to 4,845 yuan. Then, the exchange rate returned to flat, and gold shops' buying intentions suddenly increased, coupled with retail investors taking advantage of the low price to buy in, and it continued to rise to a peak of 4,870 yuan. Soon, securities firms saw an opportunity and again sold, and a certain bank and gold shop also rushed to sell again, and then gold shops sold out, resulting in a further small decline to a low price of 4,836 yuan. After that, securities firms made some profits and re-entered the market. Although a certain bank again sold, it finally recovered several yuan by the close of noon, to 4,842 yuan. The afternoon market hovered, with even smaller fluctuations, but the market trend was slightly hardened. Although a certain gold shop and a certain securities firm sold off one after another, it ultimately continued to improve by 7 yuan due to the strong suction from the money exchange industry, to 4,849 yuan. As a result, it was still down slightly by 13 yuan compared to the previous day, and the total daily transaction was about 2,000 taels. Gold jewelry shops did not change their prices, and customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The "red" also fell slightly by 13 yuan</p>
<p>Since the opening of the morning, the situation was quite flat. At first, a securities firm sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop for 4,860 yuan, a slight decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous close. Soon, a certain gold shop still had buying appetite, and retail investors also followed up slightly, stepping up by 10 yuan. A certain gold shop entered 20 taels of money exchange business, for 4,870 yuan. Later, a certain securities firm suddenly sold on behalf of its firm, and the US dollar exchange rate was slightly reported firm at that time, and gold shops and money exchange businesses also sold each other, and in a moment it was fiercely suppressed by 25 yuan. A securities firm paid 30 taels to the money exchange business for 4,845 yuan. Then, gold shops saw the cheapness and aggressively entered, coupled with a certain bank also dragging retail investors in, and the exchange rate suddenly reported a return to flat, so the market rose again, reaching 4,870 yuan. However, after that, buyers gradually decreased and the selling momentum suddenly increased. A certain securities firm came to sell again, and a certain gold shop made a profit and sold again. In addition, gold shops and a certain bank also sold each other, and again fell by a small 34 yuan. A gold shop sold 10 taels to a gold shop for 4,836 yuan. At 11:15, money exchange businesses bought cheaply, and a certain securities firm also turned from selling to buying, and immediately recovered 18 yuan. A securities firm entered 44 taels of help from the gold shop for 4,854 yuan. At noon, a certain bank started selling again, and it was lowered by 12 yuan. A certain company paid 30 taels to the gold shop for 4,842 yuan, as the closing price for the noon. In the afternoon, the money exchange business came to search for purchases first, and the market opened 8 yuan higher. A certain gold shop entered 20 taels of gold shops for 4,850 yuan. Later, a certain bank also tracked and bought in, and continued to rise by 5 yuan, entering 20 taels of help from the gold shop for 4,855 yuan. However, after that, a certain gold shop suddenly sold fiercely, for 40 yuan. Gold shops did each other 10 taels for 4,845 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business forcefully entered more than 100 taels, and again pulled up 18 yuan. The gold shop paid 50 taels to the securities firm for 4,863 yuan. After entering, a certain securities firm suddenly sold on behalf of the customer group, and then stepped back 14 yuan. The securities firm paid 20 taels to the gold shop for 4,849 yuan, as the closing price for the evening. As a result, it was down slightly by 13 yuan compared to the previous day, with fluctuations of 34 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash gold number's own brand gold is several yuan higher than the "red", and the purchase price is reduced by 20 yuan. The current bid gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the "Yi" brand gold, and there is little trading.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Still Hangs at the Original Price</p>
<p>The gold jewelry in the gold shops is exchanged per tael, and it does not move all day. The Da Tong Hang still hangs at the original price of 490 yuan. The new firms have the same price as the upper price, and the purchase price is reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's rice market situation was similar to the previous day, and it was still a morning rise and afternoon fatigue situation. At the opening of the early market, the general local hometown shops took the opportunity of yesterday's rice price returning to flat to continue to purchase, and the situation turned tight again. The market rose step by step, and the highest price rose by more than one yuan compared to the previous market. No. 1 Saigon was sold at 47.5 yuan, Huojiao was 45.7 yuan, and all other foreign goods were good. However, after this wave, the goods in the hands of floating speculators returned to the market at a high price. Since the chips on the market surged, the stores' real appetite did not change their rash re-entry, and they all announced that they would withdraw their hands, and the overall market color suddenly suffered a setback, and it was no longer able to rise as vigorously as in the early market, and it also went down step by step. As a result, the closing quotations for various foreign rice were only 45 jiao better than before. No. 1 Saigon was 47 yuan, Huojiao was 45.2-3 yuan, Tokyo Jiantou Dashi goods returned from 42.5 yuan to 42 yuan, and mixed broken rice returned from 36.5 yuan to about 36 yuan. The number of transactions has increased from more than 3,000 to 5,000-6,000 bags. Although some profit-taking floaters sold out, the spot high prices were all raised by 45 jiao. In terms of futures, because the market was firmly held, the Tongshi only opened 200-300 tons of No. 2 Saigon Xiaojiao, No. 2 Saigon was 53 yuan, and Xiaojiao was 51.5 yuan. However, in the afternoon, there were again floating retail investors selling out, and the entrants did not move, and the market showed a soft image again.</p>
<p>In the morning, glutinous rice took advantage of the foreign rice boom, and there were many customer groups pulling in. The market price once rose by half a yuan, but the impact also returned to flat, without much rise. In terms of thick and thin japonica and early and late rice, etc., there were more than 2,000 bags that were transferred from Hongkou yesterday. However, it was heard that the dark market outside the market was extremely expensive, and it was not easy to invite the owner, and it was very few to want to make it. Only Changxi Special Japonica still had a slight opening. For the rest, such as thin rice and early and late rice, the goods owners were still trying to keep pace with foreign rice, which led to the other party not intending to pick it up, and there was no transaction.</p>
<p>Foreign rice also arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the French ship MIN (transliteration) directly transported more than 70 bags of foreign rice from Xihuang, imported at noon, and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf in Hongkou to unload.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Su Wheat Slightly Down <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>There is no special change in flour. The declining trend of old car brand return goods has also subsided slightly, and there are a few inquiries from rural villages in the mainland. The warehouse receipt price is 14.4 yuan, which is up 2 jiao from the previous day. Other artillery, warship and other brands do not have formal market conditions. In this time of high prices, the market of 2-3 jiao up and down is equal to no glory or disgrace. Today, 1,000 bags of flour were transported to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat transactions included the opening of five trucks of Suzhou wheat, priced at 24.5 yuan, which is a small decrease of 5 jiao compared to the previous opening price. According to Suzhou white wheat, the quality is the best, and it is different from the situation in Wuhu wheat. It is said that the current bottom of domestic wheat is less than 30,000 bags, and the new pricing of foreign wheat is 30 yuan, which remains to be verified.</p>

<p>In the past two days, the wind and waves in the oil market have gradually calmed down. The market fluctuated slightly yesterday, but its activity was not great. In the early morning, the market was affected by foreign influences, and the soybean oil market rose, which was a 1.5 yuan increase from the previous day. Peanut oil also returned to the market. In the afternoon, the sales of materials were lacking, and people's hearts were not swimming, and the market turned from high to low. As a result, it was the same as the opening price. The Tongshi totaled the transaction of 180 barrels of Lian You, priced at 114.5 yuan, 114 yuan, 20 barrels of Jiangbei oil, priced at 112 yuan, and 150 dan of Dayou oil, priced at 91.5 yuan, 91 yuan, 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at 115.5 yuan, 115 yuan, 2,600 cans of Jiangbei raw oil, priced at 110 yuan, and 200 cans of Yantai raw oil, priced at 109 yuan.</p>

<p>In the securities dark market, yesterday's market turned from weak to strong, and gradually revealed vitality. The market is also rumored that there will be the issuance of treasury bills, which is only for the purpose of controlling the exchange rate, and has nothing to do with public bonds. Ambassador Johnson's trip to Chongqing may be related to the financial aspects. The credit crunch is due to the hoarding of cotton yarn, which is only a change of direction for hoarding families. Public bonds are bought and sold by remittance, and have independent characteristics, so people's hearts are moved by the high and low of other prices. Seeing that the big players are opening up and suddenly increasing their positions, and the new shorts are suddenly making up for their positions, the future may still have a good side. Yesterday morning's trading was still clear, but people's hearts have gradually turned firm. Type C deferred bonds came out at 8 yuan. In the afternoon, Xinfu continued to receive purchases, Lianhe slightly made up for its short positions, and Lianyi Shenkang continued to buy. Xieda also had considerable needs. Although Hongkang, Tongkang and No. 18 continued to sell, the market price still rose again and again, and the transaction gradually increased. As a result, they all returned to one to five jiao, and the total number of transactions was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of China Trust Company were transacted at a price of 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of the stock market in the public industry was filled with selling pressure, and almost all stocks were affected. The price fell to the downstream quickly, and many also created a low price record in January. However, this soft trend soon ceased. Buying orders poured in, and the market gradually improved. The closing price at noon was slightly the same as the previous day's closing. In the afternoon, the buying trend was even stronger, and the price had a renewed improvement. The closing trend was extremely firm. Rubber stocks rose due to the tightening of exchange rates. The rest of the market was initially very unsustainable. However, it also returned later, and the closing price was the best of the day.</p>
<p>London, 29th (Thursday) - Today's listed market for Chinese foreign debt is still flat, and there is no change in the upper and lower bonds.</p>

<p>The yarn market started to rise and then became tired, but the trend is still upright. The general non-industry people have a deep understanding of rising prices, and they are unwilling to give up the amount of absorption at low prices. In addition, there is no hope for the raw materials to relax temporarily. At the same time, the spot sales in the South have a little bit of retail purchase. Therefore, people's hearts are firm.

<p>The transaction of cotton has developed greatly, but the factory's needs have not been very prosperous, but slightly lively. The rest of the peers buy and sell each other, as lively as ever.

<p>New York telegraphic dispatch on the 29th: The stock market today: Short covering in steel stocks caused a slight increase in steel stocks. The government's move to dismantle major public utility companies into smaller units pushed many utility stocks to new lows for the year. A few special stocks were quite active. Other than that, the market was mixed. There were no special news affecting steel stocks. Only yesterday, "Steel Age" published an article stating that the decline in steel production has come to an end, thus promoting short covering.</p>

<h3 id="e104">This Road is Blocked! <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>I say that the current social system has already reached a dead end like a bull's horn. This is not a deliberate exaggeration, but a real and undeniable situation. We only need to look at the sharpening of social contradictions to understand what I mean.</p>
<p>A tragedy occurred in Tianjin where starving people robbed flour. The police, in order to maintain order, opened fire to suppress the riot, resulting in the death of six starving people.</p>
<p>Under the current situation, these starving people would have starved to death sooner or later, so killing six of them is not a big deal. However, from this painful fact, we can clearly see the sadness and bewilderment of the current society:</p>
<p>Flour is meant to be eaten, but now it is hoarded, causing many people to sigh when they see flour. This seems to be the fault of the flour merchants. However, the flour belongs to the merchants, and they have the right to do whatever they want with it. No one can interfere with them. Therefore, the flour shop owners seem to be blameless and feel justified.</p>
<p>The duty of the police is to maintain the peace and order of society, so it is justifiable for them to use guns when they see starving people robbing flour. However, the poor people with rumbling stomachs are really starving and, seeing so much flour piled up, due to their natural needs, their appetites are aroused, and they rise up to rob it. How can you kill people for no reason? Don't the poor have the right to live?</p>
<p>The weakness of the current social system lies in this: on the one hand, it cannot limit the excessive exploitation by wealthy merchants, and on the other hand, it fails to take care of the lives of the majority of ordinary people. That's why I say the current social system has reached a dead end like a bull's horn, because "this road is blocked"!</p>

<h3 id="e105">Mines <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Degang</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, we have seen reports that countless ships of England, France, and many neutral countries have been sunk by German mines. There are also countless fishing boats that have been sunk by mines while fishing in the ocean. However, because fishing boats are generally small, although several are sunk every day, ordinary newspapers often neglect to report them.</p>
<p>What exactly are mines? Why are they so dangerous? What is their construction like? Readers would surely be interested to know.</p>
<p>Mines are divided into two types: fixed mines and magnetic mines. Let's first talk about the first type:</p>
<p>A fixed mine consists of two parts: the first part is a hollow iron ball that can float on the surface of the water. The ball contains powerful explosives, weighing between one hundred and two hundred kilograms. The ball is equipped with three metal-encased glass tubes as detonators. When any of these detonators touch the hull of a ship, the glass tube breaks, and the sulfuric acid inside flows into a battery. Immediately, an electric current is generated, causing the explosive to detonate instantly. The second part of a fixed mine is an anchor shaped like a frog, with four small wheels to facilitate movement on the mine-laying ship. The anchor has an iron cable attached to it, allowing it to connect to the floating iron ball.</p>
<p>The ship used to lay mines can be an ordinary ship, a warship, or a submarine. The laying method is also very simple: first, the mine's anchor is dropped, securing it to the seabed. The iron cable on the anchor keeps the iron ball at a fixed depth in the seawater, preventing the ball from floating freely. The depth of the ball below the surface of the water is determined by the situation. If the mine is intended to detonate ships on the surface, the iron ball is placed two meters below the surface. If it is used to detonate submarines, then the iron ball is placed twenty meters below the surface.</p>
<p>The deployment of these fixed mines is also divided into two types: the first type is called the "rosary bead" method, which means placing a row of mines in a straight line, sometimes even connecting each mine with a rope. The second type is called the "dispersed" method, which means placing several rows of mines one after another.</p>
<p>During the last World War, the naval authorities of Great Britain and the United States, in order to destroy German submarines, laid a long minefield from Scotland to Norway in the North Sea, burying a total of seventy-seven thousand and thirty mines.</p>
<p>Next, we will talk about magnetic mines. The construction principle of magnetic mines is roughly the same as that of fixed mines, but magnetic mines do not have anchors and have magnetic properties, drifting with the waves without a fixed direction. Therefore, the danger of this type of mine is greater. According to international law, it is not allowed to be used, but Germany currently disregards these regulations and uses them extensively, causing ships of neutral countries to often be attacked by mines innocently. Therefore, the naval authorities of Great Britain and France send many minesweepers to the ocean to retrieve these mines every day, day and night. This work is arduous and dangerous, but they believe that one day they will be able to remove all these terrible things!</p>

<h3 id="e106">Friend of China – Ambassador Johnson <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Chu</p>
<p>Ambassador Johnson is short and stout, resembling a pillow. At fifty-three years old, his hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes are already thin and light blonde. He has a ruddy complexion, a rather large nose, a strong jaw, and a smile that never ceases. In appearance, he looks more like an American businessman than the plenipotentiary ambassador of the United States of America.</p>
<p>Eleven years ago—that is, in 1929—he became the minister to China. In 1935, he was promoted to be the first American ambassador to China, with his salary increasing from $10,000 to $17,500. These years have coincided with China's turbulent times, and the United States is most concerned about the safety of the Far East. Ambassador Johnson's responsibilities have undoubtedly become even greater.</p>
<p>He arrived in China during the late Qing Dynasty. At the age of twenty-four, he was already working as a judge in the "New Yamen" in Shanghai, which proves how early his relationship with China began! In 1918, he was recalled to the country and served in the Far Eastern Division of the State Department. He later rose to become the director of the Far Eastern Division. At forty, he became the Under Secretary of State, and two years later, the important task of envoy to China fell on his shoulders, and he has remained there until now.</p>
<p>He is truly a Sinophile, able to speak good Mandarin, not only able to understand Chinese newspapers, but also able to read classical Chinese. His linguistic talent is outstanding. When he was studying at the University of Washington in the United States, he mastered Greek, Latin, and German very well. He can sing Chinese songs and also plays the pipa very well. When friends gather, nothing is more interesting than having him sing a song.</p>
<p>Ambassador Johnson has no airs. He has the informal and modest attitude of an American. When meeting with reporters, he often wears only a shirt. At banquets, he always likes to sit on the floor. He drinks very little alcohol and likes to smoke a cheap brand of cigarettes called Hadman. He loves to read "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" and always carries this book with him when he travels to various ports in China. He also loves to read detective novels. In addition to the Chinese pipa, he can also play several Western musical instruments well. He is also a seasoned golfer.</p>
<p>The ambassador's wife is named Jane Beck, and she and their two children now live in Beiping. Speaking of Beiping, it is also where the ambassador got married. Originally, in 1931, the ambassador's wife and her brother were traveling around the world, and when they arrived in Beiping, it happened that the wife's family and the ambassador's family had been friends for three generations, so she stayed at the embassy. One day, the single minister suddenly notified his friends that he would marry Miss Jane at six o'clock the next day. Thus, she became his wife.</p>
<p>When the ambassador was in Chongqing, he would get up at seven in the morning, eat a hearty breakfast, and then take a sedan chair carried by four people to the embassy to work. There, he had to read and answer more than forty telegrams from all over China. At night, he would occasionally invite guests for a purely male dinner, or he would read some light reading and go to bed.</p>
<p>The ambassador's life is very difficult. He might be awakened in the middle of the night by an air raid siren, and hurriedly take refuge in an air raid shelter. The embassy has a solid air raid shelter, but if it were directly hit by a bomb, it would also be reduced to powder. Last time the ambassador inspected the Yangtze River, there were rumors against the ambassador, but fortunately nothing happened. For the sake of the close friendship between China and the United States, we respectfully wish Ambassador Johnson safety and health!</p>

<p>Education</p>
<h3 id="e108">German Spy Training <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Spies, because they are entrusted with special missions, must be strictly selected. Moreover, they need to undergo a long period of training in order to become accomplished spies.</p>
<p>In peacetime, spy training is usually the responsibility of specialized personnel; in wartime, it is the responsibility of experienced veteran spies.</p>
<p>German spy training is relatively strict and scientific because Germany has specialized schools for training spies, especially the special intelligence class attached to the Army University in Berlin, Germany. Their students are directly designated by the Minister of the Army from the graduates of the Army University, and the course is two years. Their courses are: 1. History of Intelligence Development; 2. Organization of Intelligence; 3. Strategy and Planning of Intelligence; 4. Technology and Knowledge; 5. Importance and Methods of Reconnaissance; 6. Psychology; 7. Photography; 8. Human Biometrics; 9. Foreign Languages. There is also a practical work period of three to six months, and their future positions are determined based on the quality of their performance in this practical work.</p>
<p>Germany not only conducts rigorous training domestically but also has specialized schools for training spies in various legions. Their courses are: 1. Organization of Enemy Forces; 2. Identification of Enemy Forces; 3. Identification of Weapon Calibers; 4. Characteristics of Fortified Positions; 5. Identification of Maps and Terrain; 6. Explosives; 7. Confessions After Being Captured. These lessons are all taught orally and vary depending on the individual because they are determined by the country to which the trainee will be sent. As for the length of their graduation period, important spies generally undergo training for two to three weeks to a month or a month and a half; unimportant scouts only undergo training for about ten days to three weeks.</p>
<p>Various Thoughts</p>
<h3 id="e109">University Education <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Shu</p>
<p>The famous British educator Henry Newman said: "The purpose of university education is to raise the intellectual level of society, to train the thinking of the general public, to clarify the tastes of the nation, to improve the spirit of the times, and to beautify the lives of individuals... It is to train people to be competent in various positions and familiar with various things."</p>
<p>He also said: "A university student must have a clear mind, a correct point of view, and eloquent speech; he knows when to speak or remain silent, he can accurately ask or answer questions, he can speak, listen, be serious, and be humorous..."</p>
<p>I do not expect that our university education can achieve these goals one hundred percent, and that all our university students can meet these standards. No, I only hope that they truly "educate for the sake of education" and produce fewer bookworms who only know how to "follow the rules" and "obey orders", or treasures who spend all day watching movies and running to dance halls. That would be fortunate indeed.</p>

<p>Overseas Art Scene</p>
<h3 id="e110">Lin Yutang Plans to Build a Theater to Perform Various Dramas and Promote Chinese Art <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Qiu Wen</p>
<p>The Chinese theater, built by overseas Chinese in America on Duster Street in New York, is expected to be fully completed in the middle of this month since construction began in July of last year. It is reported that the initiators of the construction of the theater are the writer Lin Yutang and Gu Baowei, and all the construction costs and expenses are allocated by the American Chinese Drama Association, with an estimated cost of 550,000 US dollars. Later, because the association's public reserve fund for the 29th year was insufficient, it was temporarily changed to 450,000 US dollars. The entire structure of the theater is modeled after the three-dimensional pattern of the American Astoke Theater, so it is extremely magnificent. It is said that after the establishment of the theater in the future, two Chinese art exhibition rooms will be opened on the third floor, specializing in displaying Chinese artistic works from past generations. As for the performance of dramas, the Chinese Drama Club and the Chinese Drama Theater will take turns performing various Chinese dramas in the theater every Saturday to promote Chinese art.</p>
<h3 id="e111">A Unique Ice Skating Blockbuster – Ice Tree Silver Flower <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>This is a silver flower among ice skating blockbusters. It appears on the silver screen with a newer look. The ice skating scene is entirely colorful, undoubtedly creating an unprecedented film miracle. The sensation of "Ice Tree Silver Flower" throughout Shanghai is an inevitable fact.</p>
<p>The main characters are Joan Crawford, Thomas Stewart, and Louis Ares, three major stars. The male and female stars performing ice skating are the internationally renowned Universal Ice Show. All the male and female actors have undergone considerably hard training over the years and have divine performances. The dance skills in this film have a different style than any previous ice skating film. It integrates grand and delicate styles, including an Indian tribal dance, a Mother Goose waltz, a comedic mandarin duck dance, and a demonic tango. The entire film is filled with natural colors, presenting a more beautiful visual experience.</p>
<p>The plot is full of tragic elements. It fully reveals the suffering of the artists. The wife joins a film company, and the company creates her star status but with a strange condition: she must remain single until the end. As a result, a married couple can only treat each other as strangers in front of the crowd. The pain in their hearts can be imagined. Joan Crawford sings "Something's Gotta Happen Soon" in "Ice Tree Silver Flower", which is worth listening to by every movie fan.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Drums Along the Mohawk <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Drums Along the Mohawk" depicts the arduous struggles that the United States of America went through in its early days. The playwright unfolds a page of righteous history on a newly married couple. At the same time, for the first time in American movies, it shows the Indian's superficial hatred of white people, with a backstage instigator. Their actions are merely puppets for people to drive.</p>
<p>We are naturally very happy to see such a movie because it shows us that building a free country requires finding a path to peace from thorns. The situation when the United States was founded is exactly the era we are in now.</p>
<p>But the distribution of this play is a case of the guest overshadowing the host. For example, the scene of Claudette Colbert giving birth is an unimportant scene in the entire play, and it should be even more determined to go through the final pass after the volunteers return. Its best description of the joy of the crowd and Henry Fonda's surprise at becoming a father for the first time will relax the subsequent play; although this scene alone is a very exciting scene.</p>
<p>As for the director John Ford, he made a mistake by accepting and depicting the humorous aspects of this script. For example, Olive attempts to protect her bed after the Indians enter the room; when the enemy attacks, she turns to another scene because of her death. All of this reduces the value of the script itself, and at the same time, the entire play loses its cohesive power.</p>
<p>Henry Fonda is calm and powerful. I think Claudette Colbert is suitable for comedies.</p>

<p>Yang Xiaolou Also Admires Li Chunlai (Part 1)</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a lack of talent in the opera world, and it is even more difficult to find talent in the Sheng (male) and Wusheng (martial male) roles. In the past, it was still felt that the Beijing Chaopai (Beijing style) was slightly better, but now it cannot be said that. Let's take Zhou Xinfang as an example. Apart from his husky voice, which makes it difficult to compare his singing with that of the northern performers, his acting style, expressions, and physical skills are indeed better than those of Ma Lianliang, Tan Xinpei, and others. At the same time, his skills are also highly praised by the Pingjiao (opera critics), which shows that as long as the goods are genuine, you don't have to worry about not being appreciated by connoisseurs. I still remember twenty years ago when the Tianchan Stage on Erma Road in this city invited Xiaolou to perform in the south, the veteran performer Li Chunlai happened to be on the same stage as Yang. At that time, Chunlai was already over sixty years old and had lost his teeth, while Xiaolou was in his middle age and was at the height of his singing career. Although the two belonged to the Taishan Beidou (leading figures) in the northern and southern Wusheng roles, Li was good at short fighting and followed the Huang Pang (Yueshan) style, while Yang was good at performing in long costumes and inherited the mantle of Mao Bao (Yu Jusheng). The so-called "well water does not interfere with river water," each had their own specialties. Xiaolou had long admired Li's name. It was said that in his heyday, he often brought dozens of supporting actors with him, including the so-called "Hum and Ha Generals," "Four Vajras," and "Thirty-Six Somersaults." For example, the veteran performer Shen Yunqiu, who in his later years performed in Yi Wu Hao (A Righteous and Heroic Hero) for a long time, was one of the Hum and Ha Generals. Also, Tan Yongkui, who would open his mouth and jump, Wu Jing (martial male painted face) Li Deshan, Ju Dekui, Wu Dan (martial female) Qi Caifen, Shui Shang Piao, and others, all followed Li in performances, listed as one of the Vajras. Later, after Gai Jiaotian succeeded Chunlai as the priest of the southern short fighting Wusheng, Shen, Li, Qi, and others were recruited by Gai Lao Wu (Gai Jiaotian), also taking the meaning of being familiar with the road.</p>
