<p>社評</p>
<h3>文化與抗戰</h3>
<p>中這次的抗戰、是民族主義運動的偉大成就，這一點、就是　和中國敵對着的日人、也未嘗不肯定的予以承認。中國的民族運動，在歷史上和社會上都有悠久深厚的根源，春秋的尊王攘夷，南宋諸將的志切匡復、和明末顧黃諸老的抱殘守闕究心學術，都應當作爲具體而微的原始民族運動來看待；而孫中山先生及其繼承者所領導的民族主義，尤能在最近中國遭受侵略的塲合獲致空前效果者，則二十餘年來的新文化運動實有其不可磨　的貢獻。這一文化運動，曾把人民從蒙昧頑冥狀態當中喚醒起來，也曾使民族思想深植於社會的各個角落、因之纔會有中國歷史上第一次的全國對外戰爭。目前在戎馬倥惚軍書旁午期間、當然也不會把已往文化運動的偉績，輕易忘却、何况在歷史的回憶而外、更有現實的重大意義。</p>
<p>文化與戰爭的關係，以已往的黑暗時代與現今的文明時代相比較，其間顯然具有鴻溝般的差異。在從前的時候，戰爭要靠國人體力和簡單武器來決脾、文化不惟無補於武事，反而有時形成可厭的障礙。所以那時候開化人民往往不是野蠻部落的對手、文化本身也就不免在戰爭當中遭受詛咒。及至時代進化，戰爭由單純的體力角逐蛻變而爲整個國力與文明成果的對比、文化遂到處發揮着重要作用、形成決勝的重要條件、於是以往純恃體力逞强的部落乃竟爲所謂文明國家所奴役。近四十年來、有如南菲布爾之役、摩洛哥叙利亞的叛變、以及最近義阿之役、都提供着此種慘痛的例證。更就近代科學發明方面來看：有如輕氣球的製造，由鹽製鹼的成功，坦克車的發明、都是戰事需要所促成。此皮歐戰甫經擴大、德方的新奇武器已一再　之報章，其可信程度固尙成問題、但無疑今日列强科學家均正竭其智力以求制勝之方。他如精神的激勵、敵愾的發揚、都要從文化方面來運用。這些事實、都證明了在現代戰爭　中、文化方面的努力實與軍事政治經濟具有同等的重要。</p>
<p>從現代觀點來看、中國不能否認自身的落後；然而中國却絕不同於那些沒有歷史或者不求進步的國家。一方舊的民族遺產有豐富的寳藏，他方近年文化科學運動也有光榮的業績、則際此存亡絕續的非常時代、當不僅以故步自封　效　學步爲已足，更應該磨　激揚、發揮光大、從　美到求真、從究源到實用、各　本位上的努力、創爲時代文化以與當前的抗建偉大任務相配合。固然、救亡急於救火、在危急之秋，一個民族的最大力　都該直接用之於抗戰行動，然而、要學者上火綫，讓藝術家去衝鋒、其成績必遠不如一個來自田間的壯丁；而硏究室裏的收穫、文學藝術的創造、其所貢獻的價値也正不容作過低的估量。一只馬賽曲、曾經激厲法國士兵的敵愾、坦克車的發明，也曾使協約國什前此歐戰中獲致有決定性的勝利。此種奇蹟、未必就不能重見於今日之中國。</p>
<p>三年以米、全中國的文化從業員、無論在前後方以主淪陷地區，都盡了很大的努力、把艱苦從事的精神作業貢之於時代和民族。但是嚴格以求、這自然很不夠。在前綫通訉一類消息當中時常可以看到士兵們精神飢饉的呼聲；劃時代的偉大貢獻，無論在思想文學科學　樹各個部門都至今尚付缺如。這自然不能不切迫期待　所有文化門土更進一步的奮力、同時、也不能不注意解除他們所遭際的困難。社會方面、從來很少給予文化以有力的鼓勵文士之流、也很少能享到可以過得去的生活；自從物價暴漲、楮墨奇昂，直接最感受威脅的是文人、間接最遭受打擊的是文化、其間除中央一度以十萬元撥充文藝基金而外，一般社會、對此始終鮮所措意。即以上海地力而言，目前雖失掉政治經濟文化中心的地位、却依舊不曾减少其舉足重輕的影響；且在前後方各地之中，上拇所蒙受損害和擾亂比較最少、對於文化工作實具有相當便利的條件。然而這裏只看見幾十萬萬游資譸張爲幻、發國難財者躊躇滿志、而所有文化事業和文化人員都無不困處空前窘迫之中、得不到社會相當的扶持和助力。即便目前局勢是救死不遑、而一個有關民族根本的問題業不能容其自由生　。何況文化一向最爲侵略者所深嫉，正　意予以隨殘和滅絕；而另一方面。文化又正是國家民族的精神堡壘、復興建國的主要根基。在今天這一問題是應當放在第一位去考慮的。</p>
<h3>一周戰況　五月十九至廿五日</h3>

<h3>男子的遺精癥與　女性月經病療法</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博　士黃仲昌</p>
<p>我們醫師在硏究遺精症的病因時，的可分爲兩大原因，其一純由先天衰弱而生，其二則完全由後天新傷而成，先天衰弱是母體健康失常所致，後天斲傷則手淫，縱慾及操勞過度等是。凡有上述等過失者，遺精必難避免，而且手淫只　不自然的空想力，努力幻想　索，所以極容易使注意力和推想力衰弱，遺精不免，試想精液旣由手淫排出不已，再加緊遺精的威　，人體生理上所產生的精液，勢必枯竭無餘，遺精之後，就是衰弱的暗示，如不及早將遺精洽好，則神經衰弱癥接踵而至，同時早洩陽痿發育不全等煩惱病症無可避免</p>
<p>洽療遺精，切忌用霜烈之藥品，除清心寡欲之外，服以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以培補虧損，增精補血，則不論先天衰弱後天新傷均能轉弱爲强，然後每於陲前進服「耐而斯遺精片」三片，則遺精可澈底根治，兩藥同服，收效如神。</p>
<p>至於女性常患的月經症，亦與健康有關，如月經不調，經來腹痛，月經來量過多與過少等，均屬病態，凡有此種疾病的人，第一是妨碍生育，不妊症難免，第二是身心上的不適，此種女子常促短壽命，治療之法，端在調整月經，服以女用「補體康」卽可達到調經種子並促進發育，解除貧血腎虧之功，蓋女用「補體康」之成分，完全採自卵巢內分泌素，並有補腦，補血，補腎之礦質成分摻入，是故功效準確，譽爲婦科中的傑品。</p>
<h3>手淫遺精治愈例</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士　鄭霆</p>
<p>患者章雲明，年廿三歲，向在某印書館爲職員，（自訴）—發育時誤犯手淫，初係受不良友人的引誘，其後習慣成自然，每夜必手淫一次，甚至晨起亦必手淫以圖一時快感，因之面黃肌瘦，神經衰弱，遺精滑精，叢集一身，作事無力，發育亦受阻，有時雖停止手淫，然睡夢時必引起遺精，晨起昏懶，終日不適，體益虧損，乞爲治療云云。（治愈經過）先囑每日三次服以德國雄壯動物睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以培補虧損，更施行電療以固精關，睡前並投以「耐而斯遺精片」三片，以止遺精，如此三面兼治，不到三月，章君所患各症，完全治愈，體重亦增加五六磅矣。</p>
<h3>急性白應特別注意</h3>
<p>— 德國醫　學博士　王克春醫師</p>
<p>急性白濁，的可分爲如下數期，卽潛期InKubationsyeit，粘液期或前驅期Stadium　Mucosum，S．Prodromorunm，膿漏期或極盛期Stadium　BlennorrbaicnM．S．floritionis减退期Stadiumr　secrementi等，潛伏期之淋菌，卽潛伏尿道舟狀窩內等處，營分裂增殖作用，其處卽因淋菌。毒素的刺戟，而呈炎症之反應，此潛伏尿道部分殖工作之淋菌時，無何等現象，及其炎疾發炎於外，則爲病態顯露之朕兆，及此等炎症漸漸嚴重，而分泌出一種粘液，此時如其用顯微鏡檢査，則可見除了上皮細之外，尙有多核白血球，及許多淋菌混入於內，其後即入極盛期，此時一般多在二三日見此症。而流出液，由牛乳狀之粘液膿性，而變爲漸次濃厚之黃色之膿液，至第二星期則變作綠色而帶微量血液之膿液，炎症如火之焚，龜頭包皮浮腫，排尿不暢，痛苦殊甚。如此又的一星期左右，泌出液漸少，痛苦漸輕，而入减退期，但如其在此時而猶米治愈，則必轉入慢性，而變症百出矣。故此時不可不注意其療法也。余從事淋病治療，業已多年，而以德國彼德博士發明之「克淋儂」一藥爲內服劑，立能扑滅淋菌。而杜絕其侵人深部之根源，一方更外用「抗淋水」按法自家洗滌尿，尤爲相得益彰之妙。至於女子淋毒白帶，可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，內服「克淋儂」亦收同等的功效。蓋用此等特效藥治療，其功效可指日而待也。</p>
<h3>淋病講座</h3>
<p>— 姚菊醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路　九號四川路口</p>
<p>夏天為何淋菌活躍？</p>
<p>時序與細菌</p>
<p>時序與細菌之生存，有莫大之關係，故許多時令的疾病，在其一時令中，則流行頗爲倡厥，而在某一時令中，幾不見其蹤跡。此蓋與氣候活動的效能，有十二分關係之故也。現在且以淋菌的活動而言，淋病的傳染固不限於氣候時令，但對於淋菌的活動，不能不說與氣候無關也。當此春去夏來，萬物欣欣向榮之時，而吾人亦因夏日炎熱，於行動方面，亦較其他季節爲活動。於是久伏之淋菌，不免乘機出動，　行爲虐，故有未愈之慢性淋，往往要到夏天重行爆發者，其故即在乎此。更有一種原因，亦爲淋病放肆之要素，即吾人一到夏天，於性慾方面較他　爲需要。故亦爲淋病　傳染之主因也。</p>
<p>易愈的機緣</p>
<p>然而括又應該回過來，在此淋菌最活躍的季節，也就是淋病最易治的季節。因爲此時淋菌久蟄思動，大有傾　來犯之勢。所以乘其全部活動時，作一網打盡之根治，實爲一　數得之事。就余所經騐，惟用淋病聖　「新克淋儂」（永安公司有售）最佳。因爲「新克淋儂」殺菌之功效，無微不至，乃更用德國靜電療法，及Ｘ線電療交相爲用，結果其潛伏之淋菌，無不迅速撲滅，故新夏時序，實爲剿滅淋病最好的機會，幸勿錯過此種良機。</p>
<p>診所：上午十時至下午六時。</p>
<h3>咯血應速根治</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>關於因結核病之咯血，由於病變部分血管脆弱，因了運動和咳嗽等關係，而突使脈管破裂而成咯血症狀，結核病本爲慢性病，一切病的變化，其經過均極蠕緩。惟咯血一症，爲其突發之事，故須作有效之處置，絕對不可疎忽。惟在學理上及經騐上，咯血並非絕對危篤之症。但亦不能視爲輕微症狀。以余多年來之經騐，在內服藥方面，惟「補　拿爾」功效最著，不僅可將咯血治愈。卽咯血之根源，亦可根治，余　肺病咯血之並不可畏者，其故卽在於此。且「補　拿爾」有殺滅肺結　菌之奇功，故爲　病與咯血最有效之內　　。</p>

<h3>日人聲色自娛　已入簡頹廢途徑　虹口之日青年豪飲狂歌　國內生活窮困人心厭戰　蘇聯遠東防務日趨堅强</h3>
<p>據昨日日文大陸新報記載、日與亞院華中聯絡部次長及川、以居留上海虹口區域之日本青年、最近縱情聲色、豪飲狂歌、忘却前綫劇　、國勢阽危、此種表現世紀末之瘋狂及</p>
<p>頹廢現象大非佳兆、故發表談話、促此輩反省、證之昨日每日新聞之統計、日在滬居留民為七萬人、而飲食店則有三百卅家、喫茶店五十四家、料理二十五家、可見此種營業之發達、日本國民儉樸之風、本為世　共知、乃最近風氣、</p>
<p>忽呈突變</p>
<p>據最近由日本來滬之某人談、此種頹風、在日本國內、亦　一般現象、蓋日本自侵華三年以來、對外貿易衰落、及國內經濟情形之漸瀕絕跡、已為不可掩飾之事實、自粵北·桂面·贛北·鄂北日軍敗績後、在軍事方面、已不能操勝算在</p>
<p>政治方面</p>
<p>本擬利用偽「政府」、能解決中國事件、但又毫無結果、阿部信行此次奉派來華、本抱有重大使命與滿腔熱望、至此目擊心傷、毫無前途、殊出其個人意料之外、故阿部在南京閉門謝客、即偽方大員往訪、亦拒不延見、因之曾</p>
<p>謠傳阿部</p>
<p>已赴越南者、由於上述情形、日本人民既感侵略戰爭消耗之無為、復遭日常生活趨窮困之壓迫、厭戰情緒既深、而又不敢公然反戰、內心若悶、無可伸訴、遂縱情聲色、借酒澆愁、以為麻醉、此種悲慘景象、實為中外人士所寄予無限同情者也、</p>
<p>蘇聯全力防禦日本</p>
<p>頃有某西人由哈爾濱來滬、據談、蘇聯對於歐戰雖極注意、但並未絲毫鬆懈對日之防範、蘇聯在其遠東邊境、不但已强化軍事防禦上之必要措置、且積極充實經濟建設、務令遠東達到自足自給、以備萬一需要東西兩面作戰時、遠東方面、不必倚賴國內他處之供給、遠東之</p>
<p>重工業現正加緊擴充、例如蘇摩里斯克之大規模製鐵廠、查奧得之製鐵廠、及其他在動工中之工廠、均將提前完成其建設、（依第三次五年計劃、應於一九四二年完成）哈巴羅夫斯克之</p>
<p>兵工廠遠東軍需工廠、正忙於增加生產、屯　原料、哈巴羅夫斯克之煉油工廠、亦已開工、關於軍事運輸方面、與西伯利亞平行向西蜿蜒約千三百哩之鐵路及其各支綫、工事進行、非常秘密、但已距完全竣工期不遠、關於糧食方面、正着手農業</p>
<p>機械化、並獎勵移民、成績頗佳、觀於移民中有遠自烏克蘭來者、足見蘇聯對於遠東農業開發之積極、據該西人觀察、日蘇兩國雖彼此均有謀接近之心理、但相互間之利害對立、則已成為難於消滅之障壁、故彼此均不能不準備在可能　生之未來軍事衝突中制勝也、</p>
<h3>國貨運往南洋　銷路倍增</h3>
<p>歐洲僑胞遷地營業　愛用國貨極力提倡</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向本市各國貨團體探悉、歐洲戰事轉趨緊張後、旅居歐洲僑胞紛紛避居南洋各屬地經營商業、並愛國心切、對於抵制日貨不遺餘力、極力提倡國貨、協助當地商民推動、並力加勸導服用國貨、凡有購買國貨者、即詳加說明國貨品質之精美及耐用、故國貨之運銷南洋、倍形增加、並頗得當地人氏之樂於購用、此於抗戰建國裨益殊巨、據悉行銷該地者以電器·搪瓷·棉織·針織·等品為大宗、蓋國內工廠在銷路苦悶之際、惟一銷路、為向外發展、因華僑之服用國貨、與國人不分軒輊也、</p>
<h3>工潮兩起</h3>
<p>競新印書館怠工　八達廠工人絕食</p>

<p>八達綢廠</p>
<p>要求增加工資不遂、七十餘人實行絕食、查河南路海寗路八達綢廠、規模相當宏大、傭工一百五十餘人、近因物價更加高漲、廠中準備部女工及帮機工人、因每日所得六七角之工資、無法維持生活、向資方提出要求不遂、奔告無門、彼七十餘人乃實行在廠中絕食、以促資方覺　、一方面擬請求工部局工業科從速調解、</p>

<h3>教友派友誼會　收容流浪兒童　施以心理治療卓著成效　苦兒度新生活均感愉快</h3>
<p>大陸報云、教友派友誼會觀於街頭流浪兒童、被環境所迫、流為小竊、爰設「招待所」於愚　路一〇八六弄八號、收容流浪兒童、　以心理上「治療」、記者頃走訪之、其中現收容兒童十七名、備受優待、白　或團坐圓桌前讀書習字、或羣集陽光普照之草地上、</p>
<p>跳踉遊戲患疾者受醫治、臥床上則被褥整潔、種種情景、殊足令人感動、該所保姆貝漢娜女士、和善可親、與記者談話時、方為一童揩拭創傷、據貝女士　、流浪兒童入所時、身有創傷者佔三分之一、彼　先　警員押入捕房、因恐懼異常、不敢發言、比送入「招待所」後、即溫言宣慰之、</p>
<p>流落街頭之經過、所答幾盡相同、非一九三七年滬戰時與父母分散、即在家受拷打、私自逃出、遂流落街頭、孤苦無告者數閱月、始經警員送來、惟數月流浪、如何得以溫飽、則不肯言明、來所後見人人皆如友好、乃消失其疑慮、而歡然開始其新的生活云、又據該所照護人陳女士稱、收容此輩流浪兒童、毫無困難、待之適當、則</p>
<p>不難教養最費事者、厥為兒童入所時、使之潔身云、下述一事、可代表各竄之已往經過、綠有一男童名孔和弟（譯音）者、年甫七歲、其容已呈飽受困苦之狀、兩腿與身部有烏青之撻打痕跡、可見其在家中遭異母苛待之甚、因不堪其苦、乃逃出流為浪童、旋遭</p>

<p>乘機尅扣平糶米斤量、殊屬違背每口五斤之原旨、如（一）慈北獲東鄉長戎紹龐、對鄉民每名祗售三斤、餘二斤自行私賣中飽、（二）慈北護西鄉長虞瑞璋、對每名祗售三斤四兩或半斤不等、（三）慈北附海鄉第二保長楊乾、每名五斤祗售四斤八兩等情、如果屬實、逕函請該各地方軍警機關拘拿懲辦、以儆效尤、</p>

<h3>從嗬匯停市說到外幣存款</h3>
<p>— 穆深思</p>
<p>自德軍侵入嗬境，上海嗬滙即告停市（五月十三日，）凡執有嗬幣匯款或存款者、因無匯率合成法幣或其他貨幣，以致一時不得動用、實與遭受扣押無異。其所蒙損害、可以想見。又考嗬匯之先，尙有德匯、亦早經於去年（九月四日）因歐戰爆發而停市，迄今九閱。所幸者，上海嗬德貨幣交易不多，蒙害者尙屬有限，且因知者甚鮮，一般人士未加重視。然其意義之嚴重，固不容吾人輕忽也。試思嗬匯德匯旣已先後停市，則由於局勢之推移，焉能斷定其他外匯決無停市之可能？往昔國人以存儲國幣為原則、除進出口商人外，鮮有外幣存儲者。今則不然，自中日戰事發生、國經爭購外匯。最初僅為富有者之資金逃避。嗣後上海黑市外匯步縮，一般意志薄弱者，誤認法幣基礎動搖，稍有資財，即競購外幣，以爲得計。馴至不惜以四五倍代價購存外幣，其危險性誠非若輩所能計及。筆者不敏，心所謂危，不得不吐，　抒管見，期與讀者一商榷之：</p>
<p>逃避資金固爲戰時不可避免之現象，惟當時僅有中日戰爭，其他國家安靜無事，購存外幣，或有可原。今則歐戰日趨擴大，吾國均有波及可能，一旦局勢變遷，發生某匯停市，則存有某匯者，勢必措手不及，遭受封鎖，悔已晚矣。存有外幣者當考慮及之，此其一。</p>
<p>際此世界局勢不定中，凡「滙兌統制」與「貨幣貶値」，不僅爲失利國家之當然現象，亦爲勝利國家之可能措施；換言之，不獨經濟拮据國家宜施行之，經濟優越國家亦可實施之。例如義國實行匯兌統制，義幣不得自　滙出，已數載於茲；又如世界最富有國家之美金，早已拆值五九〇六，目前因英美匯兌暴落，復有再度貶值之盛傳。蓋「國幣對外價值，過高過低，均非所宜。所謂「統制」與「貶值」，即為現代經濟政策之運用。此其二。</p>
<p>或以為向當地外國銀行結存某幣存款，實際上改仍存於當地，此係心理錯覺。按諸事實，凡存外幣者，其款早已匯往外國。茍一旦某國發生事變，當地某匯因之停市，則該款勢必無法還成國幣，質言之，即無法提回存款，蓋已遭受改國封鎖。不可不知之，此其三。</p>
<p>或謂購儲外鈔較存外匯為佳，殊不知任何國家鈔票，僅在國內通用，其在國外仍有價値者、因有滙率故耳。一旦某滙停市，某鈔即同樣失去價值，目前荷鈔即具明證。昔年馬克與盧布之破產，受害者厥為國外之執有人，而德俄國家均有相當之利得焉。加以鈔值本較滙值爲低，因須扣除利息運輸與保險等費，平時尙且如此，戰時交通阻梗，損失人人，况執有少</p>
<p>或謂購藏條金、究屬實貨，最為可，殊靠不知黃金早已收歸國有，上海環境特殊，政府法令，一時不及，乃有黃金黑市產生，價值飛昇，較之中央銀行法定價格，超越數倍。　日抗戰勝利，政府縱不予沒收，而以法定價格收集之、、購藏者損失已屬不貲矣，且美國現正閙黃金過多恐慌，主張抑低金價之說，時有所聞。存有黃金者，亦當計及之，此其五。</p>
<p>進言之，近來外匯趨勢易長，考其主要　素有四：（一）專事扒結外匯之某方，今則反爲供給者。據云此乃換成法幣，以之收集土貨出口，故售出外匯，無須購　，且可從此源源供給。證以某籍銀行連日出售現貨，兼拋遠期，此說似堪置信。（二）世界風雲曰惡，各國遠東屬地之資金，以及各地華僑之存款，恐　為各當局統制，避難來滬，為數頗巨。（三）現已牽涉歐戰之各國銀行，以及傳說即將參戰之某國銀行等，勢必出售外匯，易成法幣，以應付存戶之提成。（四）據專家估計上海進口日少，未結外滙，爲數無幾，另一方面出口吒盛季節已屆，此後外滙市塲瓦屋過於求，定可預下，除上述四點外，最近豫鄂會戰空前勝利，國人對於法幣之信心益堅，亦爲此後外匯易跌難漲之另一因紫。善於經營外滙投機者，早已窺及，固無待筆者之饒舌。惟一般本與外匯無緣者，旣不知外滙爲何物，更缺乏經濟常識，至於世界經濟狀况之現實與演變，固無論矣。若輩或惑於投機之獲利，或受謠言之中傷，一味盲從，競購外匯或外鈔，實屬憑不可及。即令彼等之外幣幸而不遭遇「停匯」或「貶値」等情事，然一俟抗建完成，黑市告終，勢必以法定匯率結之，（英匯一先令二辦士半，美滙二十元）則其資財亦已十去七八矣。曷如在吾國軍事日形順利之今日，將所存外幣還成法幣，在國家銀行領導之下，投資西南，爲國家謀建設，爲子孫造幸福，目可享受「保息」與「分紅」之權利（見日前報載）。較之儲存外幣，以寳貴之財力，專供異族使用，尤處於世界風雲萬分險惡中，每易遭受一部或全部損失之危險，智愚之判擇，寗待借箸耶</p>

<p>「自然水準」與「人為為準」</p>
<p>現在或許正有不少人在硏究着：「目前對英三便士半，對美四元六八七五，是否就是新的自然水準」？甚至還會研究淸：「這個水準，將穩定多少時間」？</p>
<p>一般投機份子，依照他們的投機經騐，想像着所謂「自然水凖」也者，一定是一個較前爲低的滙價。因此黑滙市塲每經一個風潮，便產生一個新的所謂「自然水準」；而且每個新的「自然水準」總是使黑滙價縮去一二成。我覺得這是對於「自然水準」的一種侮辱。財部發言人常希望黑滙市塲在自由上落中產生一個一自然水準」如果他也把較低滙價當做「自然水凖」，實在也是一個莫可比擬的錯誤？</p>
<p>依照上述對於國際滙　的決定關鍵來說：國際滙價的主要因素，不在貨幣素村與幣値是吾平衡？而在商品貿易的是否平衡。而欲硏討商品貿易平衡的趨勢，理應依照法定的一先令二便士半的滙率來觀測戰時貿易的趨勢。如根　黑匯價推算，那末所得的結果，只是貨幣現象，只是物價現象，而不是商品貿易的眞相。唯有從商品貿易的眞相，才能發現決定滙價的主要因素正在如何變化，於是可以判斷目前的黑滙行市的是否台理？是否合乎所謂「自然水凖」的意義了？</p>
<p>這種理論如果不錯，那末我國戰時貿易平衡的趨勢，非特不比戰前惡化，抑且比戰前有很大的進步。這種進步斷非瞎吹，因為戰時的新建設，足夠抵消砲火炎下破壞的一部份，高物價又自然節約了一部份消費。如果內地的情形不足以代表全國的情形，那末不防退一步拿準淪陷區裏的上海對外貿易來說吧。上海貿易向居全國貿易總額的牛數之上。那末上海貿易平衡的實續，理應有力地影響着國際滙價的趨勢了。</p>
<p>上海的對外貿易，過去常年地呈着二億到五億以上的入超額。但開戰以來，入超額便日漸軋平。像民二十六年是减爲一億零五百萬元，二十七年减爲四千七百萬元，二十八年且一變入超而爲出超一千一百餘萬元。雖則其中並未包刮私運進口在內，然而私運出口的數量恐比私進更大。道種商品貿易平衡的進步，反射於滙市的正是冉好不過的條件。所以如果要談「自然水準一，應該是一個較高的匯價，不該是一個較低的匯價。而目前的滙價？只好說牠是一個「人爲的水準」。</p>
<p>從商品貿易的實際平衡上說：這個「人爲水準」顯已造成了他抑止進口的作用。但是從貨幣現象上說：却已使進口商受到極大的損失。那就是付出非常多的貨幣，而牧進比過去更少的貨物。因此就貨幣現象，那就是依照黑匯價來觀測當前的上海貿易收支，非特依然是人超，而且有空前龐大的入超，像二十八年份的入超貨幣値，幾達八億五千萬元之巨。</p>
<p>商品貿易是實際的出超，但反映於貨幣收支上却就形成空前的入超，這種貨幣現象的不合理可想而知：造成這種不合理現象的便是黑匯市塲。所以人們如要確保你們的財富，祇有不和黑滙市塲接觸的一法。於是政府為了調整國際收支而向黑滙市塲實施低滙價政策時，受到打擊的，只有妄圖套買我外匯的日偽。因爲政府在這種政策下的打擊對象，是日僞而非一般人民。如有人因進出黑滙市塲而認爲法幣在跌價，其實一般法幣並未跌價，跌價的只是那些進出黑滙市塲的法幣。這是他自取其禍，只好自作自受。假使黑匯市塲上日僞的套買和投機者的活動一旦停止，那末黑匯價便在商品貿易的平衡趨勢所決定中，定必立刻自然地放長。這才是黑匯市塲上的「自然水準」。總之：只要黑市上的人爲壓力一輕，那末他就一躍而上</p>
<p>外幣價值與投機利益</p>
<p>黑匯價的降落，外幣價値表面上似乎大漲特漲了。購藏外匯的人們表面上也似乎大賺特賺了。比如他們在五月一日以法幣一百元買進了美金五元七角半，到五月三日美匯已縮到四元三一二五。於是他這五元七角半的美金，便可以買到一百三十三元三角四分三毫二厘的法幣。平地裏他似乎巳賺了三十三元多。殊不這美金五元七角半，在二年　僅値十五元一角五分法幣：當他拿一百元法幣買進道五元七角半美金的時候，實際上已經蝕去了八十多元法幣。如果他現在把拿進的一百三十三元三角四分三厘的法幣保存起來，將來就可以買到四十多元美金。如果因爲你立刻就要到美國去讀書，那末一經敎育部核准，中央銀行在扣除之應納的平衡費之後，依然可以立刻售給你二三十元美金的。所以你進出黑匯市塲，表面上似乎賺錢，實際上却正大蝕其本。你的法幣在黑匯市塲進出次數愈多，那末你的實際財產所受的損失也愈大。</p>
<p>假使你們能瞭解歷史事實的，那末必須記住：一個國家政府，他如有　破壞外匯則已，吾則。一經動作，立刻就可以恢復原狀。像德蘇二國，無論他們的盧布馬克的價値跌到千百萬倍的零點之下的零點，但一到他們的政策轉變時，頃刻間就整理成功了。何况中國的法幣，根本沒有發生通貨膨脹的現象。中國的人力，物力，財力的資源，較之德蘇更豐富多多，所以要使恢復原狀，更易如反掌。你能說中國的民族精神力，獨不及德蘇等國嗎？何况中國的戰爭對象，是一隻行將拆穿的紙老虎。比之德蘇當時所遭逢的敵人，簡直是渺不足道。</p>
<p>不僅是法幣眞價値的光復是勢所必在，何况外幣的眞價値，也立刻就要「顯原形」的。黑滙市塲上外幣的昂漲，並不是外幣眞價値的增漲，乃係法幣在黑滙市塲上表面跌價所反襯出來的。道種反襯成的後果，對於歐美各國在華的商業地位，在日本的排斥之外，又多了一層嚴重的打擊。試看下表：在中國民二十六年與二十八年的進口貿易中各國所佔的比率，只有日本一國已從一七·三·六％增擴為三四·三九％，此外幾一致大减。如英國從一一·六八％激减爲五·八〇％：美國從一九·七五％激减爲一五·九四％；法國從一·五八％激减爲〇·八四％；就是德意也都在同受擯斥之列·德國已從一五·三一％降爲六·四九％，意國也從一·〇四％降爲　·八三％。這種現象，除了日本歡迎之外，沒有第二個國家會滿意的。換句話說：黑滙市塲的存在，除了日本便宜之外，歐美各團和中國同樣是大吃其虧的。不過歐美各國，目前可以少數的貨物換到高貴的代價，暫時或聊以自慰。可是在國際政局劇烈變動的現在，由於政治軍事等等理由，變更貨幣政策的國家，恐將如雨後春筍一般地發生，歐洲戰爭國家的貨幣之危危乎，已不待言。就是美金，也何能獨穗？在「歐戰擴大與美匯前途」一節裏會指出「美國雖未必立刻參戰，但經濟上的援助聯軍是有共必要的」。觀乎今日英美互匯率的穩定，不復如前之急速變動，大概就是他援助聯軍的一種方式吧？</p>
<p>日偽搗亂之最大限度</p>
<p>至於日僞的搗亂，也不足懼。因爲他們已「心有餘而力不足」。誰都知道：要搗亂，需要有搗亂的實力；所謂實力，那就是須先凖備鉅額的法幣頭寸，才能躍上黑市猛扒。過去：他用槍桿子强迫華北人民繳出法幣，繳出的已　掠奪而且已被他化盡了，窖藏的已窖藏到使他無法加以掠奪了。所以他獲得大額法幣的來源之一，現已消失。至於華中華南，因爲法幣在民間的基礎更深，所以不得不放棄他「消滅法幣一的夢，改取「利用法幣」的政策。這樣，他雖靠着對華的輸出而獲得法幣，但爲了要掠取中國的土產，仍不得不吐出法幣。因此從貿易方面搜集法幣的可能，遠不如一般人意想之大。不錯，關稅被奪，每月確有一千多萬元的法幣可以到手。但正因為他們旣然小得不「利用法幣」，因此　筆法幣也未　能至部用於套買外滙。所以他們雖然蓄志套買外匯，事實上却不節不受法幣的限制。過去，他們每次扒取外匯，已須經過一個相當長的時期，作爲技集法幣的準備。今後這個準備時間，當然要比過去更多。無論他經過很長時間來搜集法幣，但當他開始扒取外滙時，如果投機華商不跟着回時扒購，那末他的搗亂力量勢必更弱，制約機者跟　着日偽扒購外匯，這是啻是助長日偽搗亂滙市的聲勢；而且又自討苦吃。因爲政府爲了防止日偽套買而實行暫停供給，原以日僞爲打擊目標。投機者跟着日僞扒購，豈不自招損失？假使只有日僞扒而投機者不跟着走，那末雖因政府的暫停供給而一時吿緊，但緊勢就不致更大，而壓力一鬆以後的回騰力量，定必更大。這是可以想像得到的。</p>
<p>同樣的；偽方爲了要滿足他「昇官發財」麥，確有濫發小兌現紙幣的企圖，以便利他搾取民脂民膏的計劃。但「聯鈔」「華券」的着着失敗，前車可鑑。這種廢紙，無補於他的荷包，這父何必？僞「中央銀行」之所以開門無期，便是這個道理。不過他們旣因搜刮而上台，凡有搜刮可能的，當然會不計成敗，幹牠一下。但無礙於法幣，無礙於外滙，已是顯而易見。</p>
<h3>投機末日中之生路</h3>
<p>— 曹振昭</p>
<p>自本月二日香港匯豐放棄維持滙41／8率後，致英匯美匯又重見新高峯，黑市標金達七千三百元，外股亦極度上漲，有超過票面十倍或二十倍者，一日之間，市塲日用貨品，抬高至二成以上，甚至疑及法幣地位，將有變動，於是黑市以外，復有暗市，明盤以外，復有暗盤，動　恍惚，非筆墨所能宣。乃甫及一週，德忽以閃電戰術由荷比優入法境，世界經濟頓起重大變化，英美滙兌，一度跌入二元九角以內，美股連日驟跌，尤以實業股爲最，平均的跌至二十餘磅音，影響所及，遂使上海外匯驟然放長，而衆業公所各外股下降尤鉅，其他各市塲亦隨之波動　譎，靡有定時。夫外匯之仲縮，視進出口貨物之多寡，股票之高低，視本身業務之發展，初非任何人所得而操縱，無如上海各市塲，已成爲投機者壟斷之所，國內外形勢偶有變動，投機者即從而推波助瀾，翻雲覆雨。一般昧於利害，誤墮彀中，損失至於巨萬。余於三月二十五日，在本報經濟專刊中發表一文，曾分析外匯標金股票等情狀，並述投機之不可爲，以作忠吿，閱者當尙能憶及。不圖未及兩月，，而多空已易其位矣。平心而論，今日上海各種市塲，其樞紐皆在國際現勢。例如在滙豐放棄41／8匯率之際，美滙當然趨縮，然其勢必不驟，所以使之驟縮者，投機者爲之也，當德用兵法境之際，美國各市塲莫不下跌，美匯富然放長，然其勢亦必不驟，所以使之驟長者，亦投機者爲之也。於是所謂股票，標金，及各種貨品，或高或低，咸視投機者之趨向而定。投機者一伸手，一般人即羣起和之。然而勝敗之機，決于俄頃，往往投機者已翻空爲多，而一般人尙視空，投機者已翻多爲空，而一般尙執多。一出一入，　壤懸殊，豈一般人意料所及哉。要知我國係以法幣爲本位，自前方勝利迭决傳來，法幣地位無形提高，與黑市外匯，本無關係，即因進口洋貨，必須結購外匯，亦僅一時需要，値茲國際風雲險惡，外輪時聞徵集，此後國際貿易漸减，需要外匯亦漸减，凡非經營進口業者，斷不可再購外滙，自速其亡。即已購買各種貨物者，亦應顧及市塲情況，不宜再事囤積，至於黃金將來必由國家搜購，本無利息之可言，而外股有息可收者，亦不必妄自菲薄。果能抱定宗旨，不與投機者以可乘之機。則市面由此而定，金融由此而安矣。雖然投機者虎，而爲之作倀者游資也。此種游資，據外界之統計，的在五十萬萬元以上。其中一大部份，皆係內地國人，避居上海移之而來者。當此生活日高，居大不易，僅恃存款博取銀行微利，不足以維持　生活。偶而經營投機，藉　差益，　情自可原，苟有確實生利之途，自不致爲行險饒倖之計。</p>
<p>至一般薪給階級，鑒於生活程度之日高，炫于厚利，忘其利害，　然盲從幸而獲利，所得無幾。不幸而失利，必致傾家蕩產而尙不敷，則其情尤可憐憫。余以爲　健之道，在今日唯有刻苦自勵，視富貴如浮雲，斷不可再捲人漩渦，自貽伊戚，尤不可再翻多爲空，重蹈覆轍。至如手存現金或外匯，而無法運用者，其一，最好以外匯定存銀行生息，旣可保障安全，又可滋生利息，在銀行則視其定存日期之久</p>
<p>市塲知識問題，因地位關係，本期暫停。，暫優予給息。其二，如苦於游資過剩者，銀行可特闢信託部，優量介紹投資於內地工廠，或代規劃運　方法，代爲經營內地各種事業，且可由銀行或政府保息，化無用游資爲有用。其三，如將款項匯人內地存款者，銀行可從優照市申水，並優給存息，如欲將利息作爲生活費者，其到期利息，仍可按原定匯費匯滬，照付法幣。如定存經過若干時期，仍願櫃滬者，銀行亦可如數照匯，小受限制。且其匯費如較舊時爲長者，可按新匯費計算，反之仍按舊匯費計算，以示優待。以上數點，僅略述其梗槪，其詳細計劃，自當由各經濟專家精密計議。至套利台息雖厚，適足助長投機之風，且如差額過鉅，危險性極大，尤不可爲。游資苟能一有舊宿，則上海各業市塲必可安定，而內地生產事業亦趨繁榮矣。彼擁有遊資者，在此匯長金跌貨落聲中，懲前毖後，何去何從，當無待豐干之饒舌也。</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>荷蘭人的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 彤呆</p>
<p>荷關這一個低地國，而今已因德國的進攻而陷落了。這裏，筆者想一說的，是荷蘭人的衣食住行。因爲荷蘭人在這方面的風俗，和各國是不同的。</p>
<p>衣荷蘭的農人和漁人，在服裝上都因地區的關係，有很多的差別。名聞世界的舊時代的荷蘭服裝，像木鞋，像大脚管褲，打锏的圍裙，前端高出的風兜，兩邊蹺起的小帽，祇是在沿海諸省，尤其是各島上可以時常見到。不過大戰以後，就是那些地方的年靑人，也有厭棄本國型服裝的傾向了。</p>
<p>食　荷蘭沿海一帶，農塲中土地肥沃，物產很多，所以甘蔗，山芋，和豆這些東西，荷蘭人也吃不完。爲了養牛事業在荷蘭相當發達，奶油和乳酪，每年出產很多，成了荷蘭人普通的食物。新鮮的或罐裝的牛奶，到處可以買到。家禽也相當充斥。總之，荷蘭人民吃的方面，是非常舒服。每年有一决定期的宴會舉行，到了那天，更是熱鬧，而大家要大吃一次哩！</p>
<p>住　荷蘭國內，雖然不產石料，可是建有不少莊嚴，富麗的房屋和其他建染物。首都海牙，有優雅的風光，同時也有官僚化的氣象，街道寬闊，水道交錯，王宮，議院，和政府都在這地方。富豪住宅也多。阿姆斯德丹是荷蘭最有國際風光的都市，新頴的現代建築物到處可見，這地方的大造船所是十分著名的。荷蘭的民族，有三種成分，就是，住在沿海諸省的法里森族，住在東部的撒克遜族，住在南部的蘭克斯族，各有小同的特性的。</p>
<p>行　何蘭的交通，不拘水陸，都很便利，尤其是行業，相當的發達。不拘輪船，火車，汽車，近代的交通器具，到處可以看見。尤其使人注意的是遍地有腳踏車可見。離海牙三英里外的文寗根海水浴塲，是歐洲著名的地方，有整齊的綠蔭大道通到海牙。不過第一商業都市洛特丹，街道不很　潔，和阿姆斯德丹相比，那就差得很遠，而帶有荷蘭本國的風光了。</p>
<h3>男子夏服的改良</h3>
<p>— 耳東</p>
<p>最近靑年會發出通吿一則，徵求男千夏服的改良式樣，理由是：世界婦女服裝都很輕便舒適，男子則西裝硬領，華人則長袍垂地。極不宜夏令穿着。故有此議。辦法是：以舒適，美觀，大方，經濟爲四原則。手續是：繪就新服圖樣，阻　話及地址，於六月卅日以前寄交靑年會羣育部。由該部採用後，給予獎品。</p>
<p>的確，現有的夏服，穿來極感累贅，尤其是出外酬酢，穿西服穿中裝無疑地都異常難受，却又不得小受。以前亦有人提倡長袍减短運動，以計劃不善，不久默默無聞，今番肯年會出來偶議，有了完美的式樣，提侶起來亦易見效果。我們謹寄厚望。</p>
<p>我們試把四個原則檢討一下：經濟該居首位，那末間接地就可减少窮措大製備價昂的綢衣的困難，同時又不損體面。西裝一襲，至少數十元，情形亦同。至於舒適，應以寬大爲主，美觀和大方，我想該在反面說過來，只要不難看就是了。</p>
<p>不過，男子服裝向來很少變化，此番改良，必甚不易，這自得看提倡者的努力，而大衆合意的式樣，則又看設計得如何了。</p>
<h3>大哉栩園</h3>
<p>— 一之寄自荷國柳苗村</p>
<p>願公化身千萬億，爲「衣食住行」大放光明。</p>
<p>三生幽草夢杭州。遊戲神仙蝶與周。被樹沾雲寒食淚。忽敎吹綠滿西歐。（栩園以民二十九之三月二十四日細雨中，撒手塵寰，老友瘦鵑往送之，噩耗傳至西歐，鬥庭花木，纔沾宿雨之靑，萬里感通，如響斯應。）子皮貨殖稱無敵。臣朔文章擅外家。科學爲魂藝爲骨。新機如海發奇花。（家庭工業社製無敵牌牙粉及化妝品，力挽利權，遐邇贊許。衣食住行特的撰述之科學論文，別具入妙入微之　人藝術。）</p>
<p>並肩管宜同傳。出海雲霞絕才。城郭江山丁令宅。何年化鶴賦歸來。（天虛我生旅滇作　　感懷和　兒　四詩，有「涉趣園林甘入夢」之句。）此行或詣潘　史。再世當爲愛迪生T．A．Fdison。佇看中華齊法美。蟹行書誦栩園名。（法文英文皆橫寫，「蟹行書」如譯爲臘丁語源之英文，可稱之爲CancerSeript）。以蒙瘦鵑先生之招宴，獲於民十四之十二月，一瞻栩園風采。（此事栩園有記，見諸是年十二月六日之上海畫報）。栩國公詼諧神味，微類民元以前主辦世界社之故監委周公柏年。二公齒相若，籍相近，並以文化先覺而持籌滬市，同情之感，油然以興。而栩園計慮精詳，涉歷豐富，先在人文蔚起之杭　，首創萃利公司於保住坊大律，爲我文化男之國貨事業樹先聲，並聯合桂海詞人潘蘭史輩，發行闡究文藝之雜誌，談笑雜絲竹，桃李滿門牆，望之直如神仙中人。而公意終以蟄居內省，未獲主掌世界大城之論壇爲憾，如是往返滬杭者多次，而有志　吿成功，越數年技事繁興，愛公者益引爲慶幸。吾故謂栩園奮鬥歷程，在我勵精圖治之中華，最當爲無量數靑年勤求出路者所師法。誠以我中國之患，莫如貧愚弱之三大病，綜栩園之一生，足稱者有三特色。能興實業以救貧，一也。能治科學以療愚，二也。能精於詩文，並能如東方朔之博觀外家書，凡所爲文，極能曲盡方塊字「立體性」質强力大之特長，反較錯把漢文當洋語，一味拉「長蔴綫」之後學靑年更精切。以不識洋字者，反爲昭示科學價値之好身手，絕不示弱，三也</p>
<p>昔者五季大亂，有人仰犬默禱，曰願早生聖人。方今中國患貧父患愚，且患意志能力之薄弱，若有人視國家前途之興勝，自必曰，願天更生如栩園者千萬億，以遂科學救國之推行，蓋一國之人才，最忌如黃金偏聚於一隅之不能遠布與勻分，二詩吟客陳立夫指導訓育目標與方法之十六字訓，所謂「自信信道，自治治事，自養養人，自衛衛國云云，必在野之人，各以栩園之命，乃可望朝野相得而表裏相成，浙有兩陳，其揆一也。</p>
<p>抑予嘗閱先進國之史傳書報以及大事記焉，西方作家所推重之今古名人，門戶之見不能無所偏，推而至於其極，將謂「强國有人，而强國以外大抵空無人」。他日中國自力臻盛强，果能袪除貧愚弱之三大病者，則如栩園其名，不獨可以寫成蟹行字，而見重於異國論史之儔，且必化身千萬億，彌漫於國中，如太平洋彼岸之愛迪生，起爲現代科學放光明。</p>
<p>尤足奇者，聞栩園之逝，本人能預知爲上午十時，此誠科學史之一異蹟，宜憑科學之眼光，加以解釋。蓋今西土醫專家，每因統計爲依據，深信死之時刻與季節，若風雨表之可預測，羅盫博士Dr．F．Nettesheim之立論，略異於他家，大旨謂人之死，其占最多數之危險時刻，乃在半夜而後之第一時。（即中國子正丑初。）其占次多數之危險時刻，則為上午十時起至下午十三時。（已正迨未初。）再次爲第三等危險時刻，云自旁晚十七時至二十時爲止。（自酉初逮戌正）反之在此危險時刻以前一小時，盡爲死者特少之安全時刻。栩園臨逝不幸而言中之上午十時，及予十六年感舊詩之所謂「雲凄風晦十三時，」固皆巧合次多數危險時刻之定律。又據羅盫氏之推定，謂在歐洲各國，陽曆十二月及一月，盡爲死人特多之危險季節。反之四月六月及九月之三個月，死者特少云。惟査世界天氣，各地不盡相同，地氣之乾濕，最足左右天氣天氣又可從而增損疾疫與死亡。古人所謂癘氣miasma，微生物學家斥爲荒謬無稽者，而今細按疾疫及死亡之統計相對照，漸覺信而有徵。惟如中國舊說，二十四節候前三後四七日間死者之　多，至今尚爲科學界未窺破之一種神秘。最近　　之逝，即在春分節後四日間，不期而有合乎中國　說，惜乎哲人已逝，不及共予　，從輪及此　。</p>

<h3>一星期經濟榮單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>不要說是鷄鴨魚肉等葷菜價格飛漲了：就是這幾天的菜蔬也昂貴異常，眞有這人專吃白飯而不吃菜餚的趨勢。你瞧那最最平常的蓊萊，每斤貴到三角，莧菜上市已久，每斤也要兩角，蠶豆雖說每斤只須八分，然而帶着殼，佔去一半分量，也不能算廉，比較廉的，那只有每斤一角二分的捲心菜了。我家原是愛吃捲心菜的，所以每星期中總有三四天吃捲心菜。葷的做法和肉片或肉丁同炒，有時將肉切爛，用大片菜葉包做舖蓋吃。素的做法，或單獨淸炒，或加些筍片，香菌，麪筋，番薯之類，做素十景吃。總之這年頭兒度日維艱，只得專揀比較價廉的東西吃了。</p>
<p>星期一</p>
<p>捲心菜肉片　糖醋鳳尾魚　　丁炒蠶豆　香椿拌豆腐</p>
<p>星期二</p>
<p>芹菜牛肉　　　菜黃魚　　　菜煎豆腐　清炒　　菜</p>
<p>星期三</p>

<p>星期日</p>

<h3>臭蟲之患</h3>
<p>— 雲</p>
<p>臭　吮吸人血，騷擾安甯　令人寢不安枕，以致精神萎靡，影響健康與日間工作，此在社會大衆—尤其勞働大衆—尤爲夏令中莫大的生活威脅。滅除臭蟲法，如　除蟲菊粉，如注射火油汽油或臭藥水，或注射其他水液狀之殺蟲水，但其效只限於治標，有效範圍，只限於臭蟲觸及藥粉或藥水之一刹那。理想的除滅臭蟲法，應以根本滅絕爲重。最近市上盛行之爬勿動臭蟲自滅粉，臨睡前，只須以少許藥粉，倒入紙袋內，放置四牀角，即能引聚臭蟲，使蟲自斃，猶如捕蟲燈之引蛾撲火，使蟲自來，使蟲自死，旣省時，父省力。且「爬勿動臭蟲粉」能連續使用，使臭蟲逐漸减少，終奏根絕之效。洵殺蟲藥品之效能完善者也。</p>

<h3>暑假之前　升學難就業更難　求學難畢業尤難</h3>
<p>— 任明</p>
<p>做了六年的中學生，是很不容易的一件事，父母費了一番心血，應付了十二個學期的學費，自己是六年窓下，用功勤讀，也算經過了種種的磨折，總算熬到了畢業。</p>
<p>畢業，在道個年頭，並不是可樂觀的，將來的出路，是一件很渺茫的事，升學難，就業更難，然而這是畢業後的問題，誰知現在考試還未舉行，這幾天看到教務處和同學會的通吿，才知到要畢業，還有一道難關，是尙需一筆很大的用費。</p>
<p>在生活指數日高的時候，書費文具費，已難祖負，如今畢業時，這筆用費，一時更無法措籌，而道筆款子的用途，父沒有多大的價値，但因於學校當局和同學會規定的，雖然不贊成，個人不能違反全體，所以也成爲萬不能少的費用了！</p>
<p>預算起來，祗少要四十塊錢，繳款的名目有下列幾種：</p>
<p>學校方面規定的：（一）繳畢業證書手續費五元；（二）微半身照片四張（要拍二寸照片半打）</p>
<p>同學會方面規定的：（一）聚餐費八元；（二）畢業紀念刊五元（這是一本精印美觀的冊子，內容除師長題字外，乃是在各人作文簿上選出較佳的一篇文章刊載，如今印刷費漲了，五塊錢還不够，恐怕還要補緻一，二元）；（三）團體照二元；（四）畢業紀念戒三元；（五）全校師生通信錄三角（原欲附在紀念刊中，因佔篇幅過多，恐增加紙費印刷費，所以改印油印本子）；（六）畢業同學應合送紀念品給母校，作爲永久紀念（目前還沒有採購，但已暫收五元）</p>
<p>在私人方面，同學們有的在交換照片，贈送紀念品，這當然也和自己有份的，父很難推却，此外有到內地去的同學，大家還要餞行。</p>
<p>這筆費用，有人以爲算不了什麼，况且畢業是件大事，一生中難遇幾回，化道幾個錢來紀念，是很値得的。但是家境較差的同學，每個學期的用費，都是有預算的，不能多用，這筆用費，却是意外的，要拿出錢來，當然又是難事。</p>
<p>大家感歎敎育是建築在金錢上的，要進學校的大門，是非錢小行，可是到了畢業，要拿文憑，要離開學校，還是要錢，「求學難」，可是誰料到「畢業　難呢！</p>
<h3>曅業費</h3>
<p>— 茅邨</p>
<p>我有一個弟弟，他在本埠卡德路王家沙花園某小學唸書，這學期算是六年級了，將於本年暑假前畢</p>
<p>今天他跑回家來，向父親要七元錢，父親問他作什麼用，他說是「畢業費」。</p>
<p>父親因爲「畢業」而要」費，很少聽見過，以爲弟弟說謊，就借了一個電活，打給學校去詢問。學校裏的校長親自來聽電話，很爽直地吿訴父親說是事實，理由很簡單：一紙價飛漲，畢業學生很多，畢業證書學校負担不起。故要畢業，就非繳畢業費不可。」</p>
<p>父親回家以後，很氣憤，但終於開了皮箱，忍痛拿出七元錢來給了弟弟。但我却很懷疑，一張畢業文憑紙就須要七元錢嗎？紙張眞的漲到了如此地步嗎？</p>
<p>老實說，學校也必定知道這點，他們利用畢業的難關想藉此敲一下竹槓，所以竟要求出較學費相差無幾的數額來。我想在上海這種「巧立名目」的學校一定不少，希望社會上有正義感的人們一同出來制裁！</p>
<h3>衛生之道</h3>
<p>— 或人</p>
<p>夏天剛剛開始，住在鴿棚中人們已經感至熏蒸之苦，再週一些時候，自然又得抄老文章，挾破席而露宿到街頭巷尾去了。看到高樓大厦的冷氣設備，風扇不停，當然是欣羨不止，即是過冷飲店門前，也不禁垂涎三尺呢。</p>
<p>但是眼紅是沒有用的，還是在可能範圍內注意一下自己的衛生吧，窮人的生命雖不値錢，然過份的享受也不見得是幸福。</p>
<p>冷氣設備和風扇不停，住在里面確是怡然自得，可是室外的氣候是無法改變的，這冷熱的懸殊，常常在出入之間，反容易遭遇到可怕的病魔的侵入呢。同時，據醫生說，夏天必須流汗，否則統體不暢，而且冷飲刺激胃部，也是有害而無利的。這不是阿Ｑ的「你是我的兒子」，正如我們有了健全的體格，何必羨慕那些高貴的補品一樣的。</p>
<p>夏天最中要的條件，是注意飲食，時常在電桿木上看到的「勿食不潔之物，勿飲未沸之水確是包括了夏日的衛生之道。</p>
<p>不要眼紅富人們的享受，祇要留意自己的健康，如不幸而生了病，窮人的生命才不値錢呢。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天青</p>
<p>第廿四回　湖山　　各有千秋　士女歡勝共呼萬歲</p>
<p>這一天，金澹雲和蘇理雅太太商量，開了兩輛家庭旅行車，到自由村去。爲的上海有許多人，要到自由村去觀光，一部份是林建成，金澹雲的朋友，連承造何家兩位小姐廠屋的建築師也在內。一部份是蘇理雅太太的朋友，也有好幾位，都是久居中國，與中國人有親切之誼的咧。本來爲了天雨，有許多人正在猶豫之中，現在見大氣晴朗，大家都要去了。還有一位江鏡蓉先生，爲了何家小姐的綢廠，在那天行奠基禮，兩位小姐一定要請江老伯到塲，那也附趁在家庭旅行車裏。這車子是直開自由村，沿途不冉躭擱了。至於吳君素等一行人，她們由蘇州直接去。老章醫師等一行人，她們由安樂鎭直接去，都很便利。朱愛人是前一天已到了自由村，幫助着老祖父和她的母親，料理一切。好在鄉村中辦事人很多，衆擎易舉，也不須朱村長十分辛苦。還有一件事，何家小姐早兩天就寫信給朱愛人了。就是邶天的午餐，由她們擔任，因爲那天是她們的綢廠行奠基禮，她們應得請客。不過地方是要借一借村會義堂的了，她們的廠，以及她們的住屋，都造在自由村，她們現在也都是村民的一份子咧。不過到那天，因爲有外賓列席，菜似乎要辦得好點，恐怕自由村還沒有人能辦道樣的大筵席吧。但朱愛人說：這無須顧慮，自由村離蘇州不遠，到時招一家廚房，到這裏辦一辦就是了。不過你要預備多少客，方可以敎他們預備。何家小姐說是三百客够吧？她們預備這一天大饗來賓，以及自由村人。朱愛人道：無論如何，要不了三百客，减半之數，一百五—客想已够了。朱愛人是處處在節儉上打算，不肯有一點虛糜的。她就預先給她招了一家廚房，辦理妥貼。宴餐的地方，也和老祖父商量，安排好了。到了明天，有許多人，在天剛破曉時，已起身了。第一件大事，是看看今天的天氣如何？起初還覺得有些晨靄矇朧，漸漸的一輪紅日，破雲而出，宿霧全收，照耀了大地。到了那個時候，一片歡呼之聲，大家都道：「今天是一個好天氣呀！不但是人的精神全提起米，連所有的花木，也都有了精神。（二八七）</p>
<h3>筆，墨，紙</h3>
<p>— 強弓</p>
<p>我寫好這個題目，意思是要想在使用筆墨紙的人面前提倡國產品。全國—尤其是上海，對於這方面的消耗，委實也爲數可觀。</p>
<p>日常所用的筆墨紙，大都以洋貨居多，如今物價樣樣高貴，筆墨紙當然也不能例外，所以改用中國筆墨紙，即使價錢不能怎樣便宜，但利權總不至外溢了。</p>
<p>現在的學校，商號，差不多都用鋼筆，洋墨水，洋紙，一旦能改用毛筆，中國紙，那末也不無小補於國力之增加。</p>
<p>我國向來對於正式文件，都是用毛筆書寫的，機關公署所用的文書，也是用毛筆寫在中國紙上的，然而目前小學中學大學都用鋼筆寫洋紙而作他們的課業了。所以一出校鬥，簡直小能握毛筆以作文件，這似乎有點矛盾。</p>
<p>一樣的寫文，一樣的表示意思，爲什麽不用毛筆而用鋼筆？這大概風氣造成，一支鋼筆，表示學貫中西，即不能貫中西，也必可掛之衣襟而表示「登樣一。這在外表方面，固然鋼筆芥樣多，然而實際上的應用或將來出了學校的時候，則毛筆處處要和你爲難，我希望現在在核的大中小學生對於毛筆，中國紙，墨等件，亦能稍稍注意及之。</p>
<p>本文並不對中國筆墨紙有怎樣的誇獎，不過事實上毛筆等件在中國的社會　裏還是處處存在的，爲了現代的靑年學子太忽視這倘將來仍舊要利用之而視爲良友者，稍稍涉筆談之耳。</p>
<h3>姑妄聽之</h3>
<p>— 洛克</p>
<p>十年之前，據一家書店老闆　，做書生意要望着中學生做目標；因爲小學生還不知道讀書的重要，大學生是愛進跳舞塲去玩，不想讀書了，祇　中學生，才是眞正讀書的。</p>
<p>現在，據一位敎育家說，大學生進跳舞塲，中學生有不少也在進跳舞塲，還有大部分的人在電影院中，更有不少借着目前孤島上的學校，大都沒有體育的緣故而進跑冰塲，他們也和大學生一樣的不想讀書，祇有小學生，那才是眞正讀書的。</p>
<h3>從怕到勇敢</h3>
<p>我們今日需要的東西是勇敢，我們每日生活所要求的，也是勇敢。一個人生在今日的時代，如沒有心理和精神上的權能，決不能應付這人生的繁難，也許你有才學，但若無勇敢，你的成就。也很有限。若是你不會發現出自己生命中勇敢之源，你必覺着自已的心思才力均屬無用。今日有多少的人，在失望灰心中對自己說，「無用無用，這種仗不値得我們去打，與論太反對我們，我們缺乏生命所要求的主力。」在這種態度的背後，有種種無數的懼怕。從我們兒時起，這種種的懼怕，只見增加而擴大。我們兒時懼怕黑暗，懼怕比我們大的强悍學友，懼怕的功課考試不及格。稍大一點，懼怕更大，有些人懼怕他們社會的地位和經濟發生危險，有些做父親的懼怕無法維持他們家屬的生活，有些年輕男女要結婚，但又不知道經濟上怎樣辦法。我們被各種的懼　圍困着。物質上的懼怕。如無錢用，怕失業，等等，總而言之，在日常生活中，無人不經騐着懼怕，結果怎樣呢，精神疾靡，覺滿痛苦，恐慌和失效。我們的懼怕，阻當了我們的進步，閉塞了我們的才能。在絕望當中，我們大聲喊着說，「誰能救我們脫離道必死的身體呢？」人們所需要的是脫離懼怕，克服一切敗壞人格的煩悶。聖經上有一位大先知敎訓我們勇敢，他的話本是對被放逐在外的希伯來人說的，這些希伯來人被別的民族以殘忍手段，把他們從祖國放逐到文化宗敎不同的外國作囚徒，服役他們的主人。他們本是有大勇敢的民族，曾發現過給他們以力量，安慰，和權能的信心秘訣。（待續）如欲詳細研究請函郵箱一二二七號</p>

<h3>Large Numbers of Japanese Planes Raid Sichuan Yesterday Morning; Two Shot Down in Suburban Areas; Chinese Air Force Fights Bravely, Unleashing Fierce Fire; Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Non-Military Zones in Suburbs</h3>
<p>Chongqing: 136 Japanese aircraft, divided into four groups, invaded Sichuan Province at 10:50 AM on the morning of the 26th. Two of the groups flew to Hejiang, Qijiang, and Yongchuan, wreaking havoc before being repelled by the Chinese Air Force, scattering in retreat. The other two groups, comprising 72 planes, intruded into the city's airspace at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. The Chinese Air Force, well-prepared, immediately engaged in a fierce encounter. The Japanese planes initially attempted to resist stubbornly, but were subjected to severe pressure from the Chinese high-altitude aircraft and ground fire. The Japanese indiscriminately dropped dozens of bombs on the outskirts of Chongqing before attempting to flee eastward. The brave Chinese airmen pursued and attacked the second plane in the Japanese formation. The Japanese concentrated their machine-gun fire, resulting in intense firepower. General Gao, showing great courage, increased the intensity of his attacks, damaging the Japanese aircraft. The crippled Japanese plane fell behind and fled southeast. Gao did not relent, pursuing it relentlessly until it reached Xiaoguanyin Bridge (40 kilometers southeast of Chongqing), where he accurately shot it down with machine-gun fire. The Japanese plane immediately exploded, scattering flames and crashing to the ground. Gao, satisfied that his mission was accomplished, returned to base. An inspection of his aircraft revealed that it had been hit by over forty bullets from the Japanese. His bravery and skill in battle were highly praised by the air force commanders. The remaining Japanese planes fled in disarray, pursued relentlessly by the Chinese airmen. As they reached the skies over Qianjiang, another large-scale air battle ensued. The Japanese scattered, seeking escape. The Chinese Air Force, with high morale and utilizing its advantageous position, engaged in a fierce attack, shooting down another Japanese heavy bomber. The surviving Japanese planes finally managed to escape. In this battle, the Chinese Air Force achieved victory, shooting down a total of two Japanese planes and returning safely to base. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: At 2:00 PM this afternoon, 71 Japanese planes bombed the outskirts of Chongqing again, destroying many houses and killing over 200 civilians. This air raid was the most horrific since May 4th. The area most severely bombed was Hualong Bridge (transliteration), seven miles west of Chongqing. The exact number of dead and wounded is still unknown, as countless houses were flattened. Many residents were likely crushed or killed by collapsing walls. Red Cross ambulances and stretchers rushed to the bombed area, transporting the wounded to hospitals, working tirelessly through the night. The structures destroyed by the Japanese planes included three newspaper offices, one school, and many public facilities and private residences. There were no military installations in the area, and most of the residents were women and children. Fudan Middle School, which had relocated here from Shanghai, was also destroyed. However, some of the school's young students had left earlier, and the rest had sought shelter in air raid shelters when the alarm sounded. Therefore, no one was injured when the school was damaged. However, two soldiers stationed near the school were wounded by shrapnel. The Chongqing office of the Central Daily News, the printing house of another newspaper, and the courtyard of the Spanish News (transliteration) were all directly hit. Casualties were heaviest in this area. Most of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes landed outside the city. Several civilian boats on the Jialing River were also sunk. Many officials of the National Government personally went to Hualong Bridge to inspect the disaster and assess the damage. United Press reporters learned that all the wounded had been taken to hospitals in the city, and Mayor Wu Guozhen of Chongqing personally supervised their care. Although the Japanese bombs did not land inside the city, residents of Chongqing were forced to remain in air raid shelters for over four hours. The Chongqing anti-aircraft artillery fired on the Japanese planes as they approached, driving them away. (United Press, 26th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This afternoon, approximately one hundred Japanese planes heavily bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing, resulting in many civilian casualties. The city proper and its immediate surroundings were not bombed. An air raid alert was issued around 11:00 AM, reporting that several waves of Japanese planes were flying upriver toward Chongqing. Initially, people believed that the poor weather and visibility would prevent the Japanese planes from reaching Chongqing. However, half an hour later, Chinese reconnaissance planes were patrolling the city's airspace, and the first wave of 36 Japanese bombers was sighted. Around 1:00 PM, the second and third waves of Japanese planes arrived in succession. Visibility was still poor at the time. The Japanese planes were unable to drop bombs from high altitude and were afraid to descend due to anti-aircraft fire. Therefore, the hundred or so Japanese planes circled the city for two hours, waiting for the weather to improve. Shortly after 2:00 PM, the Japanese planes began diving in three waves, dropping bombs in the western suburbs. The Chinese anti-aircraft artillery immediately responded with heavy fire. One of the waves then flew back to its base along the Jialing River. The other two waves attacked Chongqing from the north and south. This was the first time that Japanese planes had dropped bombs within the city limits. (Reuters, 26th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Japanese air raids on major cities in Sichuan Province intensified again today. Ninety-nine Japanese bombers flew to various cities in Sichuan Province to bomb them. The outskirts of Chongqing were also bombed, but there were no losses. Seventy-seven of the planes bombing Chongqing flew in two formations. After the Japanese planes were spotted, Chongqing responded with anti-aircraft fire, eventually driving them away completely. The air raid alert in Chongqing lasted for over four hours that day.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Culture and the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>This war of resistance by China is a great achievement of the nationalist movement. Even the Japanese, who are our enemies, cannot deny this fact. The Chinese nationalist movement has deep and long-standing roots in history and society. The respect for the King and the expulsion of barbarians in the Spring and Autumn period, the determination of the generals of the Southern Song Dynasty to restore the country, and the efforts of scholars like Gu Yanwu and Huang Zongxi at the end of the Ming Dynasty to preserve what remained and delve into scholarship should all be regarded as specific and microcosmic examples of the early nationalist movement. Furthermore, the nationalist movement led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen and his successors has been particularly effective in the recent situation of Chinese being invaded. The New Culture Movement of the past twenty years has made indelible contributions. This cultural movement has awakened the people from a state of ignorance and obscurantism, and has deeply rooted nationalist thought in all corners of society, resulting in China's first nationwide war against foreign aggression. At this time of war, when military affairs are pressing, we should not easily forget the great achievements of the past cultural movement. Moreover, there is a significant practical significance besides historical memories.</p>
<p>The relationship between culture and war, compared to the dark ages of the past and the civilized era of today, clearly shows a huge difference. In the past, wars depended on the physical strength of the people and simple weapons. Culture not only did not help military affairs, but sometimes formed a hateful obstacle. Therefore, at that time, civilized people were often no match for barbarian tribes, and culture itself inevitably suffered curses in war. As the era evolved, wars transformed from a pure contest of physical strength into a comparison of national power and the fruits of civilization. Culture then played an important role everywhere, forming an important condition for victory. Consequently, tribes that relied solely on physical strength were enslaved by so-called civilized countries. In the past forty years, examples such as the Boer War in South Africa, the rebellions in Morocco and Syria, and the recent Italian-Ethiopian War have all provided painful examples of this. Furthermore, from the perspective of modern scientific inventions, the manufacture of lighter-than-air balloons, the success of salt-making alkali, and the invention of tanks were all prompted by the needs of war. Now that the European war has expanded, reports of new and unusual German weapons have repeatedly appeared in newspapers. Although the degree of credibility is questionable, there is no doubt that scientists of the great powers are now exerting their intelligence to find ways to win. Other things, such as spiritual motivation and the promotion of hatred of the enemy, must be applied from the cultural perspective. These facts all prove that in modern warfare, cultural efforts are as important as military, political, and economic efforts.</p>
<p>From a modern perspective, China cannot deny its own backwardness; however, China is by no means the same as those countries without history or that do not seek progress. On one hand, the old national heritage has rich treasures, and on the other hand, the recent cultural and scientific movement also has glorious achievements. In this extraordinary era of survival, we should not only be content with following the old ways but should also polish ourselves, stimulate progress, promote and magnify the results, seek truth, seek practicality, and make efforts on each position to create a culture of the times to cooperate with the great task of resistance and construction. Of course, saving the country is more urgent than putting out a fire. In times of crisis, a nation's greatest strength should be directly used in the war of resistance. However, making scholars go to the front lines and letting artists charge into battle will not be as effective as a strong man from the fields. The gains in the research room and the creation of literature and art should not be underestimated. One Marseillaise has inspired French soldiers to hate the enemy, and the invention of the tank enabled the Allied countries to achieve decisive victory in the European War. This miracle may well be seen again in today's China.</p>
<p>For three years, all Chinese cultural practitioners, whether in the front lines, the rear areas, or the occupied areas, have made great efforts to contribute their hard-working spiritual work to the times and the nation. However, strictly speaking, this is naturally not enough. In front-line communications, one can often see the calls for spiritual food from the soldiers. Groundbreaking great contributions are still lacking in various departments, whether in thought, literature, or science. Naturally, we must urgently expect all cultural figures to make further efforts. At the same time, we must pay attention to relieving the difficulties they face. Society has rarely given strong encouragement to culture, and literary people have rarely been able to enjoy a decent life. Since prices have soared and paper and ink have become extraordinarily expensive, it is the literati who feel the most threatened directly, and it is culture that suffers the most indirectly. Except for the central government once appropriating 100,000 yuan to replenish the literary and artistic fund, the general society has always shown little concern for this. Even if we take Shanghai as an example, although it has lost its position as a political, economic, and cultural center, it has not reduced its decisive influence. Moreover, among the various places in the front lines and rear areas, Shanghai has suffered the least damage and disruption, and has relatively convenient conditions for cultural work. However, here we only see hundreds of millions of speculative capital deceiving the public, and those who make money from national calamities are complacent, while all cultural undertakings and cultural personnel are trapped in unprecedented difficulties, unable to obtain adequate social support and assistance. Even if the current situation is such that we are too busy saving the dying, a problem concerning the root of the nation cannot be allowed to grow freely. Moreover, culture has always been deeply resented by the invaders, who are trying to destroy and exterminate it. On the other hand, culture is also the spiritual fortress of the country and nation, and the main foundation for revival and nation-building. Today, this issue should be considered first.</p>
<h3>Weekly War Situation: May 19th to 25th</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The spokesperson for the Military Affairs Commission stated that the most intense battles this week were still in the Henan and Hubei areas. Our troops continued to encourage the remaining men, and to fight the enemy who reinforced and counterattacked, we accomplished a counter-encirclement, killing thousands. The other Japanese troops active on the other lines were also heavily damaged. The important war achievements are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Henan and Hubei</p>
<p>The enemy who retreated from Zaoyang in northern Hubei ventured deep into our area after being reinforced on the 19th, and on the midnight of the 21st entered the periphery of our area of planned annihilation. Our troops reaching the towns of Xinyie and Luyie northeast of Fancheng saw that the counter-encirclement net had been formed, and began a full-scale attack on the noon of the 22nd. After day and night of bloody fighting, by the noon of the 13th, all of the enemy had been defeated by us and fled in all directions. The Japanese that we had surrounded in Zaoyang began to retreat south. Our troops are now stepping up efforts to annihilate the remaining Japanese troops. Also, on the morning of the 18th, our troops who had launched a fierce attack on Xinyang in southern Honan fought the Japanese and by 1:00 in the afternoon, the recapture of Xinyang was announced. In total, thousands of Japanese were killed inside and outside the city, 11 Japanese planes, more than a hundred tanks, and more than 200 vehicles were destroyed, and over ten large and small guns and over two thousand rifles and machine guns were seized, accomplishing an enormous victory in southern Honan and northern Hubei.</p>
<p>Southern Shanxi</p>
<p>More than 20,000 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery troops advanced north toward Xiangning, and were met with a fierce attack by our troops in the areas of Nanbei, Wuqin, Mabi, Yuguan, and Guanyu. After fighting bloodily for the entire day and night, by 6:00 PM of the 18th, more than a thousand Japanese had been annihilated. The Japanese retreated south, and the recapture of Xiangning was announced. Since the 20th, the Chinese troops in southeastern Shanxi have launched a full-scale attack, and the various strongholds on the periphery of Jincheng and Yangcheng have been captured by us. On the 23rd, Nan Cun and Chen Cun in Shadian west of Jincheng were captured. Over ten Japanese tanks and more than a hundred armored vehicles were destroyed. The Japanese in Jincheng are now under our control. The battle for the suburbs of Yangcheng is also extremely fierce, with the high ground northwest of the city being contested more than seven times. It was finally captured by the Chinese troops on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Hunan</p>
<p>The Chinese troops in northern Hunan have launched large-scale attacks for days, annihilating many Japanese. On the 19th, they achieved victory in attacking Yanglousi. On the evening of the 20th, they attacked Wulipai east of Linxiang. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 21st, they penetrated the Japanese lines, killing many Japanese. On the 23rd, they attacked Taolin, fighting fiercely with the Japanese, killing over a thousand Japanese, seizing over 200 guns, and destroying 40 kilometers of railway and over 20 bridges. The Japanese in northern Jiangxi have gathered thousands of troops on the east bank of Poyang Lake since the 17th and invaded in two directions. One route landed at Pingzhi in Duchang, comprising over six thousand troops, invading Majianqiao, but were fiercely attacked by us. By 3:00 PM of the 23rd, the remaining Japanese were defeated and retreated north to Caijialing. We immediately recovered Majianqiao. The other route invaded from Pengze and was still in battle against us at Mamagiao on the 23rd. We have a great advantage.</p>
<p>Southern Guangdong</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese at Wugongshan in Conghua, our troops launched a fierce attack on the morning of the 22nd. By 2:00 in the afternoon, we had captured the area, and joined forces with the friendly troops at Gaoshadi Ding to attack the enemy. At noon on the 20th, another elite unit completely eliminated the remaining enemy at Shiliuhuading and Piaotianfengding. They are now continuing to encircle and annihilate the Japanese at Shichuangbei. In summary, the recent battles have resulted in the annihilation of over three thousand Japanese officers and soldiers and the seizure of countless military supplies.</p>
<p>Southwestern Shandong</p>
<p>The Japanese army of nine thousand soldiers from Jinan have invaded Chengwu and Caoxian, gathering over four thousand people. Attached to them were ten cannons, over twenty vehicles, and many tanks were fiercely attacked by us. After a day of intense fighting, we killed over two thousand Japanese, and the remaining Japanese are based in the areas of Houji and Yangzhuzhai.</p>
<p>Chinese Air Force</p>
<p>On the morning of the 20th, seven Japanese planes were shot down in the skies over Liangshan. On the 15th, our troops near Wushengguan shot down a Japanese heavy bomber. On the 22nd, our troops in eastern Jiangxi shot down a Japanese plane in the southeast of Hukou. On the same day, our troops in southern Chahar shot down a Japanese plane northeast of Yuxian. These were all significant gains. (26th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Attack Huang'an City</h3>
<p>Lingshan, 19th evening, Chinese troops stormed Kexi Mountain, about three miles north of Huang'an, killing countless Japanese soldiers.

<h3>Disputes Expected in the Legation Quarter in Beiping</h3>
<p>Beiping, as the number of European countries involved in the war increases, disputes are expected to arise in the Legation Quarter in Dongjiaomin Lane. This is because Dongjiaomin Lane is a special zone managed by an international organization composed of a number of embassy staff from various countries. Following the fall of the Netherlands and Belgium, the Dutch legation has notified the Germans in some Dutch properties in Dongjiaomin Lane to move out. However, the German school and the German Association are now moving people into the former Austrian legation, which was seized when Germany annexed Austria, and are expelling all Dutch residents as retaliation. However, the Germans have not yet taken over the Dutch and Belgian embassies, and it is questionable whether the Japanese will allow this to happen. It should be noted that there are no Norwegian or Danish embassies in Beiping. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Tianjin, a dispute occurred last night at the entrance to the blockade line of the Tianjin Concession.

<h3>Mechanization of Soviet Coal Mining. Output Ranks First in the World</h3>
<p>TASS Special Article, in the two five-year plans, Soviet coal mines have become the most mechanized industry. In terms of coal mining mechanization, the Soviet Union ranks first in the world. At the beginning of the first five-year plan, the Soviet Union stopped buying coal mining machinery from abroad. 84% of the work of dragging to the ground has been mechanized, and coal transportation is also handled by special electric vehicles. In 1939, a total of 1,258 electric vehicles were used in Dunazhi and Gusnazhik. Due to the success of mechanization, Soviet coal production has greatly increased, reaching 132,900,000 tons in 1938, which is four and a half times more than in 1913. The third five-year plan stipulates that coal production in 1942 will be 243,000,000 tons, and all excavation work will be carried out with new methods and new machinery.</p>

<h3>Allied Forces Launch Counter-Offensive. War Situation Gradually Becoming Favorable. German Troops Fail to Attack New Allied Positions in the North. French Troops Recapture Several Strongholds Along the Somme River</h3>
<p>Paris, the General Headquarters issued a war report stating that the enemy forces in the north of our country have repeatedly attacked our army's positions, but have not succeeded. Our army has launched an offensive in certain areas along the Somme River and has been quite successful, having already captured several new strongholds. The artillery forces of both sides are quite active between the Aisne and Meuse rivers. In addition, the enemy forces have repeatedly attacked fiercely along the line of Montmédy and Arras, but have been repelled by our army. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris, responsible military officials here recently released the following news on the war situation on the front line: (1) In the Courtrai area of southern Belgium, German troops have repeatedly launched fierce attacks without success, and were subsequently repelled by the counter-offensive of French and Belgian troops. (2) The war situation is calm along the line of Valenciennes, Cambrai, and Arras in northern France. German tank units and mechanized units have been reinforced northwest of Arras, but there is not much activity. (3) On the English Channel side, the German army is still quite far south of the port of Calais, and the fighting is extremely fierce. The enemy has suffered heavy losses, especially the air force. As for the port of Boulogne, as of noon today, it is still in the hands of the French army. (4) East of Amiens, the French army is conducting mopping-up operations along the Somme River valley and has recovered several strongholds along the river. (5) On the eastern front, the French artillery fiercely bombarded German positions in the Upper Argonne area, inflicting heavy damage. (6) In the Houthulst area, the German army's attempt to forcibly cross the Scheldt River failed. (7) There is nothing worth mentioning between the Aisne and Meuse rivers and between the Lys and Somme rivers. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris, a French military spokesman claimed last night that Boulogne was still in the hands of the Allied forces before dusk yesterday, and Calais was being firmly defended by the French army. The spokesman summarized the war situation as follows:</p>
<p>German troops in the north attacked the new positions of the British and French forces, and the Belgian army has launched a counter-offensive. The fighting in the areas of Valenciennes, Cambrai, and Arras is becoming more intense. German armored vehicles and mechanized units are advancing west of the "gap" in the province of Pas-de-Calais and have occupied several ridges northwest of Arras. The fighting in the Saint-Omer area is continuing. German troops are currently attacking Boulogne, but have not been able to occupy the city as of yesterday evening. The French army continues to have local battles along the Somme River and has been quite successful. In summary, there is no need to be pessimistic. In fact, we can feel a certain confidence. However, it must be stated that the Allied forces in the north have not been surrounded and maintain all traffic in the area and receive sufficient military supplies. All the claims made by the German side are inaccurate. The German armored vehicle units that have broken into the pocket area between Arras and Amiens are attacking the west side of the Allied forces concentrated in the north and have been blocked at Saint-Omer and can only reach several ridges northwest of Arras. The most famous of these is Vimy Ridge. The German troops fighting in the "gap" in Pas-de-Calais are currently only mobile units, armored vehicles, and mechanized infantry. The infantry division has not invaded this "gap." (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>German War Report</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters, the German High Command issued a war report today stating that our army continues to advance towards the provinces of Flanders and Artois, reducing the area of activity of the enemy army within the encirclement line. However, the enemy army is still trying to resist stubbornly. In order to quickly destroy the enemy army's resistance, our army sent aircraft to assist in the battle and bombed its combat strongholds. The coastal ports of Belgium and France, such as Ostend and Dunkirk, were all bombed by our aircraft. The ammunition depot in Ostend caught fire after being hit, and a transport ship was also destroyed. On the night of the 24th, our air force bombed the east coast and southeast coast of England and achieved considerable results. Two small freighters and one warship were destroyed near Calais. Two other merchant ships (each of 5,000 tons) were also destroyed by bombs. Yesterday, the enemy lost 59 aircraft, and 11 of our air force aircraft were missing. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin, it is claimed here that the German army captured the port of Boulogne-sur-Mer yesterday. The port has a population of 60,000 and is located in the central part of the French province of Pas-de-Calais.

Quillard, with a tired face, simply said, "You know more than I do." Important official documents were also seized. Over a thousand prisoners were sent to the rear, and the German army discovered a French regimental commander in a certain place who committed suicide because of the defeat. The German army praised his loyalty and buried him. (Haitong dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Germany Claims New Weapons Will Be Used to Attack England. Three Belgian Coastal Cities Bombed to the Ground</p>
<p>Berlin, German sources here claimed yesterday that the annihilation of the British, French, Belgian, and Dutch troops trapped in southern Belgium and northern France is beyond doubt. Authoritative sources recently indicated that Germany will use a top-secret weapon in future operations against England, "It is predicted that there will be amazing miracles." They said that the contents of this secret weapon could not be disclosed at the moment, "But England will soon see the results." German bombers launched a large-scale attack on the English Channel ports of Ostend, Dunkirk, and Bruges yesterday. German military sources said that these cities have been bombed into "ruins." Therefore, the retreat of approximately 500,000 troops from the French 1st, 7th, and 9th armies, the remnants of the Belgian army, and the British expeditionary force is now hopeless, and the rear transportation of these troops has also been completely blocked. It is reported that Calais was surrounded by German troops yesterday and is about to fall. The current advance of the German army has occupied two-thirds of the land in Flanders and Picardy held by the Allied forces. The German army is attempting to break through the Vimy Ridge of Gravelines, cross the north, and cut off the Allied troops to the English Channel. The German Air Force continues to bomb troop concentration points and anti-aircraft gun positions on the French and Belgian coasts. Oil tanks, shipyards, docks, and artillery positions were also bombed at the same time. One destroyer and seven merchant transport ships totaling 10,000 tons have reportedly been destroyed.

<p>French Coastal Villages Enveloped in Flames. Mr. Walter Directs Destruction Work</p>
<p>Paris, according to military sources received here last night, the Allied forces yesterday prevented the German army from advancing from Boulogne and Calais. The Allied forces in the center advanced northward, heading straight for the German corridor to the English Channel, almost able to see the besieged Allied forces in the north. Military sources predict that the northern gap will soon be closed, isolating the German army in the Channel. The German army's lifeline to the ports of the Channel, 12 miles wide, was heavily bombarded by Allied artillery fire last night, making it impossible for the German army to use the corridor to retreat its threatened tank divisions or send reinforcements. Behind the French army's positions, a German army corps under the command of General Walter, a friend of Hitler and a senior member of the Reichstag, is active. Some of the mechanized units of this army have been cut off from the rear supply station, and some have been captured or destroyed. The German tanks and motorized units active around Saint-Omer and behind Calais and Boulogne turned north last night, and it is believed that they are trying to return to the "pocket" on the Belgian front. Yesterday's fighting in northern France actually involved two different operational situations. One was General Weygand's attempt to connect with the northern army and concentrate it on the plains of Flanders. The second was the army of General Walter harassing the French countryside, burning villages, destroying fields, factories, mines, roads, railways, and bridges, so that the Allied forces could not maintain their lines of communication. Motorized units with machine guns, armored cars, and tanks have roamed the coastal villages between Dieppe and Boulogne. These villages have become scorched earth after being passed by General Walter's troops, desolate and desolate. Thousands of farmhouses have been burned down, and countless villages are completely enveloped in flames. The dark night sky is also dyed red by the fire, and the fire is spreading very widely and can be seen from the coast of England. Millions of civilians are fleeing in panic when the German army approaches, as if they were the vanguard of the German army. In the coastal areas where German motorized units were discovered, all small boats were sunk by artillery fire. The entire coastal area has been razed to the ground by German bombers, tanks, and infantry riding in armored vehicles. Although the German bombers systematically destroyed the coastal areas with their incendiary bombs, they did not destroy the important docks, warehouses, and other large coastal ports of Boulogne and Calais. This is truly unusual. The commander of this army responsible for the destruction work is one of the famous figures in the German General Staff. He was one of the initiators of Hitler's National Socialism. Before Hitler came to power, Walter had been colluding with him for a long time. After the Nazi Party gained power, Walter was favored, and the other members of the General Staff, who were all jealous of him, called him "the Nazi general." However, Walter finally entered the General Staff and became a soldier. According to military sources here, after the German command learned that General Walter's army was surrounded by the Allied forces and was in danger, it repeatedly tried to break through the Allied encirclement. However, despite fierce attacks on the lines of the British, French, and Belgian armies, the German army made no progress except at Ghent. In Ghent, the left wing of the Allied forces has gradually retreated towards the Lys River line of Zulte. The German army also claimed to have occupied Doornik, but this news has been denied by the Belgian army. (United Press dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>German Operations on the Western Front: New Weapons Emerge Endlessly; Utilizing "Sound Terror" Methods Shows No Surprising Effect</h3>
<p>Paris: A French military communique stated that the German side has recently employed "sound terror" methods, including "sharp-sounding aircraft" that generate ear-splitting noise like numerous air raid sirens when diving. Another is "screaming bombs" equipped with cardboard containing drilled holes, which emit piercing shrieking sounds as they fall. The Allied forces are now completely accustomed to these methods, and even if they once had any surprising effect, it has now completely failed. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Bomber Squadrons on the Front Lines Assisting Allied Forces in Operations: Destroying Transportation, Bombing German Tank Columns</h3>
<p>London: Yesterday, the Ministry of Aviation announced that on the previous evening, British bombers conducted raids in northeastern France, southern Belgium, and German territory. As a result, they destroyed transport vehicles, troop concentrations, road and railway intersections, bridges, and trains. In several locations, enemy transportation lines have been thrown into chaos, with fires breaking out in multiple places, causing significant damage. Three British aircraft did not return. Today, British bomber squadrons are continuously assisting British, French, and Belgian forces in operations on various front lines. British fighter squadrons are still patrolling the airspace over various war zones and the French and Belgian coasts. According to this morning's report, twelve enemy aircraft have been shot down or severely damaged, while the British side only lost one Hurricane fighter. On Friday, a squadron of British Blenheim bombers discovered German mechanized units along coastal roads near Boulogne and immediately subjected them to intense bombing. Although some British aircraft were hit by enemy anti-aircraft fire, there were no casualties among the crew. In the evening, a large squadron of British bombers, under heavy anti-aircraft fire, destroyed a crucial canal bridge, dropping no fewer than three hundred bombs. All British aircraft returned safely, with only one pilot suffering minor injuries. Furthermore, forty German motorcycles were attacked by British Blenheim bombers, sustaining multiple hits. On Friday evening, enemy anti-aircraft positions not far from the coast were subjected to intense British air attacks, and several German armored vehicles were destroyed. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>National Churches in England Pray for Victory</h3>
<p>The King in Military Attire; Even with Protective Gear, He Personally Attends the Cathedral</p>
<p>London: King George VI designated today as a day of prayer for the British Empire and its Allied nations. Consequently, the entire country responded. Churches in major cities and small villages, as well as households, all engaged in sincere prayer. The King and Queen of the Netherlands both attended the service at Westminster Abbey, along with the Prime Minister and many cabinet members. Churches and all synagogues across the country also opened their doors for this special prayer service. When Bishop Hensley Henson was delivering his radio broadcast sermon at Westminster Abbey, a woman shouted "Peace!" The broadcast was briefly interrupted, and the woman was escorted out of the church. The Bishop continued his sermon, seemingly unaffected by the interruption. The Archbishop of Canterbury also preached at Westminster Abbey, describing the fierce and brutal advance of demonic forces. He continued, saying that a spirit of quiet confidence can break through the darkness. In this abbey, which is also a shrine to the nation's history, surrounded by memorials to heroes who faced and overcame other dangers, mere panic and unmoving worry are unacceptable. From ancient times, the German rulers have prepared for years to carry out their evil schemes with impressive, powerful machines. However, the strength of humans always surpasses that of any machine, and the spirit of free people will prove stronger than those who use machines. This can only slow down the machines. The King, wearing the uniform of the Royal Air Force, had a gas mask slung over his shoulder. The Queen also had a gas mask hanging from her shoulder. The King and Queen sat with the Queen of the Netherlands in a special pew south of the altar. The abbey was packed, with many people who arrived late standing outside. As the King, Queen, Prime Minister Churchill, and other cabinet members left the abbey, the crowd outside cheered. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, only one woman disrupted Bishop Henson's radio broadcast sermon, which was due to the overwhelming emotion induced by the religious ceremony. The Archbishop of Canterbury later broadcast his entire speech during a family prayer service. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<p>Paris: Diplomatic circles here generally believe that Italy will enter the European War between June 6th and 8th. According to reliable sources, the Italian authorities are actively taking military measures, such as rapidly conscripting army reservists, intensifying organizational efforts, and requisitioning resources. Many residents of major cities are fleeing to the countryside. The atmosphere of war is palpable. The British, French, and Belgian envoys to the Vatican, who previously resided outside Vatican City, are now preparing to move into the Vatican. The Vatican is also preparing to receive them. Observers also say that the Vatican authorities deeply believe that Italy will soon take military intervention measures. Therefore, they have advised British and French clergy to return to their respective countries. In addition, the public has been holding demonstrations for days, supporting Italy's entry into the war against Britain and France. People from all walks of life, under the leadership of Fascist Party leaders, are sending letters and telegrams, expressing the Italian nation's determination to fight. The newspapers largely predict that the British and French empires are about to cease to exist. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome: Rumors that Italy will join Germany in the war have become more widespread yesterday, based on the development of four situations. First, the Vatican Secretary of State sent letters to consulates and embassies, inquiring whether they would seek refuge in Vatican City should war break out between their countries and Italy. Second, all Italian ocean liners to the Atlantic have been postponed until June 10th, and it is announced that there will be no further schedules to the Far East and the Near East published. Third, yesterday, the official gazette published an emergency public mobilization bill approved by the King, Prime Minister Mussolini, and the cabinet committee. Fourth, the Undersecretary of War, Soddu, delivered a speech to the Italian infantry, expressing his confidence in the soldiers, saying, "This is our nation's destiny... we are preparing to advance towards the glory of new goals." (Associated Press, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian King has issued a decree stating that all those who have not performed military service and all private industrial institutions must comply with national discipline. People with the obligation to perform compulsory service are divided into four classes, as follows: (1) men aged 19 to 55 who have not currently performed military service; (2) men aged 56 to 70; (3) women aged 14 to 60. The decree also empowers Prime Minister Mussolini to mobilize all important industries in the country when necessary. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome: The semi-official "International Relations Magazine" published an article today openly advocating for national participation in the war, stating, "Germany's goals are nearly achieved, and so are Italy's. The shackles on the Italian nation in the Mediterranean Sea must be removed, thereby achieving maritime freedom. Regarding this, since Britain and France insist on opposing and refusing to change, the Italian nation cannot realize its legitimate aspirations without the use of force. In short, the decisive moment has arrived. In today's world, cowards or those 'obsessed with moral precepts' have no place to stand. Therefore, the Italian nation is currently awaiting Prime Minister Mussolini's orders, preparing to pave a new path for the security and development of the empire." (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>Italy Reaffirms Guarantee Not to Invade the Balkans; Yugoslavia Adopts Security Measures; US Hopes Hungary Will Maintain Peace</h3>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: It is heard that Italy has renewed its guarantees to the governments of the Balkan countries, stating that it does not plan to take any action in the Balkans. The semi-official Vreme newspaper carries a dispatch from Rome, saying that according to reliable sources, the Italian government has instructed its envoys to the Balkan countries to inform the governments where they are stationed that rumors of Italy having military plans in the Balkans are completely unfounded, and that Italy has firmly decided to make every effort to prevent the war from spreading to the Balkans and to continue to maintain relations with all countries on the basis of existing treaties. According to well-informed sources in Yugoslavia, the above news is quite accurate in general sense and confirms the documents received by the Yugoslav Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Allied observers here are now comparing the recent firm attitude taken by the Soviet Union with this guarantee from Italy. The recent attitude of the Soviet Union can be reflected in the remarks of Moscow leaders, that the current situation in Southeastern Europe must not be changed. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: According to information received here, Italy has concentrated 150,000 troops in Albania in the past few days. Also, the port of Zara on the Adriatic coast, which is Italy's base within Yugoslav territory, has concentrated 5,000 troops. The people along the coast of Dalmatia Province are extremely anxious upon learning of this. Observers here are deeply concerned that Italy may attack southern Serbia Province, thereby cutting off Yugoslavia's communication with Greece and Yugoslavia's communication with the Mediterranean. Due to these reasons, the Yugoslav military authorities have taken necessary steps to ensure security. On the Italian side, it is said that these measures are only precautionary in nature, in order to protect Italian interests in case Britain and France take any action in Yugoslavia or the Thessaloniki Province of Greece.

<p>Capital of Yugoslavia: The Politika newspaper recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that diplomatic and political figures in Germany are widely spreading rumors that the Soviet Union and Italy have been conducting diplomatic negotiations for some time and that an understanding will be reached imminently. Furthermore, the ambassadors of both countries have been summoned back to their respective countries and have not yet returned to their posts. They are about to return to their posts separately, because Italy urgently wants to stabilize relations with the Soviet Union before going to war against Britain and France, and wants that country to take responsibility for maintaining peace in the Balkan Peninsula, so it is trying to get closer. German officials have neither confirmed nor denied the above rumors, saying only that Germany helped broker relations between Italy and the Soviet Union some time ago. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3>Review of the Second Week of Fighting on the Western Front: Allied Strategy Fails, Germans Claim to Have Gained the Upper Hand</h3>
<p>Berlin: General Steel Fried, a military correspondent for Reuters, recently described the second week of fighting on the Western Front, stating that from May 18th to 24th, the German army created a decisive situation in the war. The area where we broke through the Maginot Line is over 100 kilometers long. Armored divisions have advanced from Amiens to the coast of the English Channel, encircling the enemy in Flanders Province from the north. The British, French, and Belgian troops currently surrounded have no chance of self-rescue. The initial operational goal of the German army was to break through the southern defenses of Namur and strike directly at the English Channel via Amiens. The constant movement of the main force of armored divisions and motorized units to that location, coupled with large reinforcements being sent to supplement that direction, is a fact. Because our army must supplement its advance to the west step by step, our southern wing is extended and its strength is empty, it will inevitably be attacked by the French army. However, at that time, the French army's strength south of the Sambre River was extremely weak. The French army, perhaps at the request of the British army, was unable to firmly refuse and concentrated its main force in the area from Valenciennes to Namur, directly protecting the coasts of the Netherlands and Belgium. The British and French commanders made this great mistake, apparently failing to properly estimate the power of the German offensive and the speed of its progress. General Gamelin thus believed that he could calmly organize countermeasures. As a result, the German armored divisions and motorized divisions advanced step by step, as easily as splitting bamboo. Saint-Quentin and Arras were occupied on May 18th, and on the 20th they advanced to Amiens and Abbeville. At this point, the communication between Flanders Province and the enemy forces within France was cut off, completing the encirclement. If German reinforcements could have quickly arrived at that time to secure the occupied positions, the fate of the British, French, and Belgian troops there could have been decided earlier. However, at that time, the French army did not immediately launch a counterattack from the south. The German army was able to consolidate its advances. Thus, General Gamelin's plan became impossible to implement. In addition, the German air force engaged in destroying railway lines, preventing French reinforcements from reaching the north. Therefore, the German army was able to maintain its positions along the Somme River and also advance to the north. Saint-Pol and Étaples fell successively. On May 22nd, the German army continued to advance towards Calais and Saint-Omer. On May 24th, after advancing to the Saint-Pol defense line between Saint-Omer and Aire, it besieged Calais and occupied Boulogne. At this point, France recalled General Weygand, commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in the Near East, to replace General Gamelin. However, after General Weygand took office, the shocking news occurred that General Giraud, commander of the French Ninth Army, was captured. This may be because General Weygand's reputation led the French army and British armored units to attempt to break through the heavy German encirclement. Fierce battles occurred in the areas of Maubeuge, Valenciennes, Saint-Pol, Arras, and Cambrai on the 20th, but the British and French forces failed to break through. Until May 24th, the German army advanced from the southeast in two directions, and the fighting in that area finally ended. On May 19th, the northern flank of the British and French Allied forces had retreated to the defense line east of Ghent, along the Scheldt River to the Franco-Belgian border. However, the German army broke through this defense line near Tournai (east of Lille) on the 23rd and immediately occupied the city of Ghent and the city of Courtrai. This was the initial situation of the breakthrough south of Ghent across the Lys River on the 24th. In addition, the German front line has advanced north along the Somme River towards Montmédy. The forts in the Maginot Line there have been attacked, but the German commander does not appear to be launching an attack there. The final decisive battle may occur first in Flanders Province.

<h3>Sweden Issues National Defense Bonds; New Swedish Pursuit Aircraft First Appear in the Sky</h3>
<p>Capital of Sweden: A rally was held in Skansen, Sweden, last night to solicit five hundred million Swedish kronor for national defense bonds. Crown Prince Gustaf of Sweden and Swedish Defense Minister Sköld delivered speeches in succession. The Crown Prince said briefly, "Sweden is fortunate to be outside the war. We have no grievances against the people of any country, but in order to maintain the country's freedom and independence, we will spare no sacrifice." The Defense Minister said in his speech, "Sweden is a small country with limited capacity, so it must maintain its consistent policies of the past." During the rally yesterday, the new Swedish pursuit aircraft appeared in the sky for the first time. Out of the five hundred million bonds, two hundred and ten million kronor were raised on yesterday alone. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>French Air Force Commander-in-Chief Encourages Troops to Maintain Historical Glory</h3>
<p>Paris: General Vuillemin, commander-in-chief of the French Air Force, issued an order encouraging the entire army, saying, "Since the outbreak of the war, you have strived day and night in the two weeks of major battles to resist the numerically superior enemy and have achieved victory. I know I can rely on you. The time for decisive battle has come today. We must ensure that our skies still belong to France. Our planes and the planes of our allies will fly wing to wing in the sky filled with glory, fly in the sky of Guynemer (the most famous French aviator in the last war). Following the example of our predecessors, win new victories to commemorate your merits." (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Youth Eagerly Register for Service; Since the Implementation of Conscription, More Than Two Million People Have Enlisted</h3>
<p>London: According to official announcement, on Friday, those who registered under the National Service (Armed Forces) Act included 326,000 men born in 1912 and those who turned 20 on April 28th. This is the largest number of people registered in a single day. The number of people who provisionally registered as conscientious objectors was 3,400 (0.105 percent). This is the lowest percentage since the start of conscription. By the end of April, 1.85 million people had been conscripted. Including the number registered on Friday, more than two million people have enlisted. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>London: The British War Office announced last night that it has decided to add several squadrons to some battalions of the Home Guard, to perform special tasks in the UK. Their age is limited to 18 to 19 and a half years. They are to be transferred to battle-trained army units when they reach the age of 20. Those who are engaged in manufacturing munitions, ships, and producing military supplies should continue their work. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>British Munitions Factories Accelerate Work</h3>
<p>London: The "National Service Column" promoted by Ernest Bevin, Minister of Labor and National Service, has begun its large-scale movement today as munitions factories are accelerating work. Transport authorities are also participating in the cooperation to enable thousands of workers, who are accustomed to sleeping in a little longer on Sundays, to go out to work as usual. They all got up early, the same as on working days, and went to the factories by train and bus. The sound of the machines turning and the clang of hammers were mixed with the sound of church bells. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Bulgarian Army</h3>
<p>Sofia: Bulgarian Minister of National Defense Daskalov yesterday submitted a broad military bill to parliament, stipulating the complete reorganization of the Bulgarian army, setting the conscription age from 17 to 65, and establishing military schools to train officers. (Reuter, 26th)</p>
<h3>Province Establishment: Wartime Special Goods Public Sales Office to Regulate Sales and Ensure Supply and Demand Balance; Trial Implementation of Several Items, to be Expanded in the Future</h3>
<p>Nancheng Correspondence: Jiangxi, located in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, has always relied on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Nanxun Railway, which connects to the Yangtze River, as its main transportation routes. After the fall of Hangzhou and the demolition of the eastern section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, the Nanxun line in northern Jiangxi also suffered the same fate. As a result, transportation in Jiangxi Province became extremely difficult, and the supply and demand of various goods could not be balanced. Major exports such as rice, porcelain, tea, paper, and bamboo and wood were difficult to regulate, and essential imported goods such as cotton yarn, cloth, kerosene, , hardware, pigments, and Western medicine were also difficult to obtain. Even when small quantities were imported, they were controlled by capitalists and war profiteers. Prices soared like a kite with a cut string. In order to stabilize foreign exchange and regulate prices, the provincial government, in addition to the monopoly of tungsten sand and other items by the Resources Commission, also established a wartime trade department. Its main business included: (A) Exports: (1) pig bristles; (2) leather and other items that could earn foreign exchange; (3) rice, paper, sugar, and other items urgently needed by neighboring provinces. Items (1) and (2) were prohibited from free trade by the public. (B) Imports: mainly cigarettes, hardware, cotton yarn, Western medicine, electrical materials, etc., which were distributed to merchants after import. However, the strength of the trade department was limited, and merchants took advantage of the situation, manipulating most of the goods, causing prices to rise sharply, of course, varying from morning to night. Currently, taking Ji'an as the standard, ordinary cotton yarn is priced at 2,300 to 2,400 yuan per bale, raw cotton is 210 yuan per 100 jin, blue cloth is 1 yuan per foot, and quinine pills are 15 cents each. Other prices can be imagined. To further control the market, the trade department has established a wartime goods public sales office, with a general office in Ji'an and branch offices in Ganzhou, Nancheng, Jingdezhen, Linchuan, and Shangrao. For the time being, cigarettes, matches, liquid fuels (gasoline, diesel, kerosene), hardware, and pigments are designated as items for public sale. All of the above items must be purchased and sold publicly by the office, and private sales by the public are prohibited. If the trial run yields good results, it will be expanded to include other items.</p>
<h3>Jinghu and Huhu-Hangzhou Railways Repeatedly Damaged; Japanese Side Uses Inducements to Protect Farmers</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The Jinghu and Huhu-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have been occupied and opened to traffic by the Japanese for more than two years. However, Chinese troops constantly damaged them, causing the Japanese side to suffer losses. Recently, the Japanese side used various methods to induce farmers along the two railways to protect the railways. Within two kilometers on both sides of the railway, Baojia (local security system) was established, and after completion, it would be extended to within five kilometers, to be completed within August. Farmers were responsible for reporting the whereabouts of Chinese troops and were subject to joint liability. If the railway was damaged, they had to report it beforehand and assist in the repair afterwards, and were not allowed to escape. All trees in the villages had to be cut down, and high ridges and hills had to be leveled. If this was implemented, villagers along the railway would be allowed to ride the train for free, and free medical treatment would be available at each station, with mobile medical vehicles and mobile low-priced sales vehicles. Priority would be given to the transportation of goods, and free agricultural seeds and vegetable seedlings would be distributed. However, the farmers, deeply aware of righteousness, ignored these inducements.</p>
<h3>Japanese and Puppet Troops Building Road in Gaoyou Lake; Landmines Kill Dozens</h3>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: On the 17th of this month, two Japanese shallow-water submarines and six speedboats, carrying over 300 Japanese and puppet soldiers and hundreds of civilian laborers, landed near Chexiemba in Gaoyou Lake to build a road. Chinese troops had previously laid landmines in the area. After the Japanese and puppet soldiers landed, they triggered the landmines, killing seventy or eighty Japanese soldiers and over a hundred puppet pacification troops. While the Japanese and puppet soldiers were in panic and chaos, Chinese troops launched a fierce attack, inflicting over a hundred more casualties despite the stubborn resistance of the Japanese and puppet forces. After a fierce battle lasting six hours, the Japanese and puppet forces were defeated and fled.</p>

<h3>The Seriousness of Stomach Disease</h3>
<p>The stomach is located between the heart and abdomen and is the general hub of the body's digestive functions. However, stomach diseases often arise due to irregular eating habits, such as loss of appetite, vomiting, acid reflux, and unbearable stomach pain, leading to internal and external complications and dangerous conditions. At this time, "Strengthening Stomach Essence" must be taken to be effective, as it can promote appetite and provide nutrients. It can quickly cure all stomach diseases, pale complexion, anemia, constipation, etc. "Strengthening Stomach Essence" is available at the Western Medicine Department of Wing On, Sincere, and The Sun.</p>

<h3>Treatment of Spermatorrhea in Men and Menstrual Disorders in Women</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Our doctors, when studying the causes of spermatorrhea, can divide them into two major reasons: one is purely due to congenital weakness, and the other is entirely due to acquired injuries. Congenital weakness is caused by abnormal maternal health, while acquired injuries are caused by masturbation, indulgence, and overwork. Those with the above-mentioned faults will inevitably suffer from spermatorrhea, and masturbation only leads to unnatural daydreams, forced fantasies , so it is very easy to weaken attention and reasoning power, and spermatorrhea is unavoidable. Just imagine that if semen is discharged incessantly by masturbation, plus the threat of spermatorrhea, the semen produced by the human body will inevitably be exhausted. After spermatorrhea, there is a sign of weakness. If spermatorrhea is not treated early, neurasthenia will follow, and at the same time, troublesome diseases such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and incomplete development are inevitable.</p>
<p>When treating spermatorrhea, avoid using harsh medicines. In addition to clearing the mind and reducing desires, take the German testicular essence preparation for men, "Bu Ti Kang," to nourish deficiencies, increase sperm, and replenish blood, so that both congenital weakness and acquired injuries can be turned from weak to strong. Then, take three tablets of "Nai Er Shi Spermatorrhea Tablets" before going to bed every night, and spermatorrhea can be completely cured. The two medicines taken together have miraculous effects.</p>
<p>As for the menstrual disorders commonly suffered by women, they are also related to health. Such as irregular menstruation, abdominal pain during menstruation, excessive or insufficient menstrual flow, etc., are all pathological conditions. Those with this kind of disease, first, hinder fertility, and infertility is unavoidable; second, physical and mental discomfort. Such women often shorten their lifespan. The method of treatment lies in adjusting menstruation. Taking female "Bu Ti Kang" can achieve the effect of regulating menstruation and promoting development, relieving anemia and kidney deficiency. The ingredients of female "Bu Ti Kang" are entirely derived from ovarian secretions, and it also contains brain-boosting, blood-replenishing, and kidney-tonifying minerals, so its efficacy is accurate and it is praised as a masterpiece in gynecology.</p>
<h3>Cured Case of Masturbation and Spermatorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Patient Zhang Yunming, 23 years old, works as a clerk in a printing house. (Self-reported) — He mistakenly committed masturbation during development. At first, he was seduced by bad friends, and later it became a natural habit. He masturbated once every night, and even in the morning he had to masturbate for temporary pleasure, resulting in a sallow complexion, neurasthenia, spermatorrhea, and nocturnal emission, all gathered in one body. He was weak in doing things, and his development was also hindered. Sometimes, although he stopped masturbating, he would inevitably experience spermatorrhea during sleep, and he would be drowsy in the morning and uncomfortable all day long. His body became more and more depleted, and he begged for treatment. (Treatment process) First, he was instructed to take the German strong animal testicular essence preparation for men, "Bu Ti Kang," three times a day to nourish deficiencies, and then electrotherapy was performed to strengthen the sperm barrier. Three tablets of "Nai Er Shi Spermatorrhea Tablets" were also given before going to bed to stop spermatorrhea. With such three-pronged treatment, in less than three months, all the symptoms suffered by Zhang Yunming were completely cured, and his weight also increased by five or six pounds.</p>
<h3>Special Attention Should Be Paid to Acute Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Wang Kechun, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Acute gonorrhea can be divided into the following stages: incubation period, mucous period or prodromal period, purulent discharge period or peak period, and remission period. The gonococci in the incubation period are latent in the navicular fossa of the urethra and other places, carrying out division and proliferation. The place is inflamed due to the stimulation of gonococci and toxins. The gonococci working in this latent urethral part have no phenomenon, and when its inflammation occurs outside, it is a sign of the onset of the disease. As this inflammation gradually becomes serious, a kind of mucus is secreted. At this time, if examined under a microscope, it can be seen that in addition to epithelial cells, there are also multinucleated white blood cells and many gonococci mixed in. After that, it enters the peak period, and this symptom is generally seen in two or three days. The outflow fluid changes from a milky mucus-purulent liquid to a gradually thick yellow pus. By the second week, it becomes a green pus with a small amount of blood. The inflammation burns like fire, and the glans and foreskin are swollen, urination is not smooth, and the pain is very severe. After another week or so, the secretion gradually decreases, the pain gradually eases, and it enters the remission period. However, if it is still not cured at this time, it will inevitably turn into a chronic disease, and various complications will occur. Therefore, attention must be paid to its treatment at this time. I have been engaged in the treatment of gonorrhea for many years, and I use "Ke Lin Nong," a medicine invented by German Dr. Peter, as an oral agent, which can immediately kill gonococci and prevent them from invading the deep parts of the body. On the other hand, using "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally to wash the urine according to the method is even more wonderful. As for female gonorrhea leukorrhea, "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories, and taking "Ke Lin Nong" internally also has the same effect. Using these special medicines for treatment, the efficacy can be expected soon.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Dr. Yao Ju</p>
<p>Clinic: Ningbo Road, No. 9, at the intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Why Are Gonococci Active in Summer?</p>
<p>Seasons and Bacteria</p>
<p>There is a great relationship between the seasons and the survival of bacteria, so many seasonal diseases are quite prevalent in a certain season, but they are rarely seen in a certain season. This is because the effectiveness of climate activity is inextricably linked. Now, let’s talk about the activity of gonococci. The transmission of gonorrhea is not limited to climate and seasons, but it cannot be said that the activity of gonococci has nothing to do with the climate. When spring goes and summer comes, all things are thriving, and we also move more actively than in other seasons due to the heat of summer. Therefore, the long-dormant gonococci inevitably take the opportunity to move out and act wantonly, so there are cases where chronic gonorrhea that has not been cured often recurs in summer, and the reason lies in this. There is another reason that is also an element of gonorrhea's licentiousness, that is, we need more sexual desire in summer than in other seasons. Therefore, it is also the main reason for the spread of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Easy Curing Opportunity</p>
<p>However, we should turn back and say that this season, when gonococci are most active, is also the season when gonorrhea is easiest to cure. Because at this time, gonococci have been dormant for a long time and are thinking about moving, and they have the potential to come and attack with all their strength. Therefore, taking advantage of their full activity to eradicate them all at once is really a one-shot-kill thing. According to my experience, only "New Ke Lin Nong" (available at Wing On Company), the holy medicine for gonorrhea, is the best. Because the bactericidal effect of "New Ke Lin Nong" is meticulous. It is even better to use German electrostatic therapy and X-ray electrotherapy alternately. As a result, the latent gonococci are quickly eliminated, so the new summer season is actually the best opportunity to eradicate gonorrhea, and don't miss this good opportunity.</p>

<h3>Hemoptysis Should Be Cured Quickly</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Regarding hemoptysis caused by tuberculosis, the blood vessels in the diseased part are fragile, and due to movement and coughing, the blood vessels rupture and cause hemoptysis symptoms. Tuberculosis is a chronic disease, and the process of all disease changes is extremely slow. However, hemoptysis is a sudden event, so effective measures must be taken and absolutely no negligence is allowed. However, in terms of theory and experience, hemoptysis is not an absolutely critical disease. But it cannot be regarded as a minor symptom. According to my many years of experience, "Bu Nao Er" is the most effective in terms of oral medicine. It can not only cure hemoptysis, but also cure the root cause of hemoptysis. I am not afraid of pulmonary tuberculosis and hemoptysis, and the reason lies in this. Moreover, "Bu Nao Er" has the miraculous effect of killing pulmonary tuberculosis bacteria, so it is the most effective internal medicine for pulmonary tuberculosis and hemoptysis.</p>

<h3>Various Belligerent Countries Such as England, France, and Germany Are Conducting Propaganda Offensives in Shanghai; Publishing Various Publications to Expand Propaganda; American Magazine Says Italy Will Not Participate in the War</h3>
<p>The recently published Millard's Review once carried an article recording the unusually active situation of the German "Fifth Column" in Shanghai. This kind of psychological warfare waged by belligerent countries in Shanghai is indeed worthy of attention. According to reporter investigations, in order to counteract it, the British and French sides also often issue pamphlets in Chinese and Japanese, distributing them to all parties, and using radio broadcasts to expand propaganda. The determination of their will cannot be overwhelmed by the temporary military victories of the German side. And the activities of the German "Fifth Column" are becoming more and more active. In addition to the lone struggle of the Huitong News Agency, it is heard that it is trying its best to make the English publications issued in this port attack England and France. The German newspaper issues an English extra once every afternoon, originally one page, but now it has been expanded to four pages. In addition, the German consulate stipulates that it will entertain Chinese and foreign reporters once a week to explain Germany's position. The German school on Da Xi Road shows a film once a week. The German side has recently issued a Chinese version of the Far East Pictorial, using pictures for propaganda. It can be said that Germany and England and France have already engaged in short-range combat in Shanghai in terms of psychological warfare.</p>
<p>Italy Will Not Participate in the War for the Time Being</p>
<p>According to an article by Mr. Woolf published in the famous American magazine "Modern History," Italy will certainly not participate in the European war recently. The longer the European war lasts, the more opportunities Italy has to bargain with Germany or the Allies. The more financial resources, manpower, and material resources the two warring countries in Europe spend, the stronger Italy's naval and military strength is than other countries. The longer the European war lasts, the more say Mussolini will have at the future peace conference. At that time, other powers will have fought to the point of exhaustion, while Italy will still be the only strong country in Europe, unaffected by economic panic and social revolution. A politician who can achieve his goals without launching a war is the most successful in the world. Hitler, Stalin, Chamberlain, and Daladier had to engage in war to meet the needs of their countries. Mussolini is currently enjoying enthusiastic support from the public in Italy, because Italy can still be the only major "non-belligerent" country when the European war is at its most intense. Therefore, as the European war continues to develop, Italy, with its status as a non-belligerent country, may be the only victorious country.</p>
<p>Outstanding Achievements of Young British Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Thomas, the son of Mr. Devitt, a British overseas Chinese and manager of the printing department of the Shanghai North-China Daily News &amp; Herald, joined the British Royal Air Force in August last year and served on the front line. He has achieved outstanding results. Recently, his family received a telegram informing them that Thomas has received a special air force medal. When he was in Shanghai, he studied at a church school and was fond of sports. He left Shanghai for England in 1934 and studied at Magdalen College in Oxford.</p>
<h3>Daylight Saving Time Can Be Achieved</h3>
<p>Hong Kong and Xiamen Will Also Follow Suit</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, the daylight saving time suggested by the Shanghai Public Concession’s Municipal Council has been enthusiastically supported by Chinese and foreign circles along the Chinese coast. Even the Japanese Chamber of Commerce, which initially expressed dissatisfaction, has also stated its support. Therefore, it is expected that this city and major coastal cities such as Hong Kong and Xiamen will uniformly move their clocks forward one hour from the afternoon of the 11th of this month. After the Municipal Council adopted the principle of daylight saving time, it immediately sent letters to the French Concession and the authorities of various coastal ports. It is heard that Hong Kong has replied, stating its full agreement. Although this statement has not been officially confirmed, well-informed sources say that the French Concession authorities have already expressed their readiness to implement daylight saving time within the concession. It is expected that the Municipal Council directors will pass the daylight saving time measure without reservation at a special meeting to be held next Wednesday.</p>
<h3>June 3rd Opium Suppression Day: Anti-Drug Movement</h3>
<p>Unanimous Response from All Circles</p>
<p>This year's June 3rd Opium Suppression Day has been stipulated by the central government, and the national anti-smoking movement will be promoted uniformly in order to eradicate the scourge of drugs and promote national health. Since the withdrawal of the national army from Shanghai and the loss of political guidelines, the opium ban has been abolished. To this day, sales are openly organized and smoking is common in the alleys. The harm is unprecedented. Therefore, all circles will unanimously respond to the anti-drug movement at that time, widely publicize it, and persuade gentlemen in the sea of sin to turn back quickly, in order to correct the situation and maintain public security.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry Ordered to Stop Doing Warehousing Receipt Loans</h3>
<p>The Silver and Money Industry Association has received an order from the Ministry of Finance that banks and money shops are not allowed to make warehousing receipt or warehouse receipt loans in the future, so as to avoid indirectly helping merchants hoard goods. It is heard that these loans are limited to daily necessities, such as food, coal balls, yarn, cloth, soap, and matches. The banks and money shops have now complied with the order.</p>
<h3>Far East Route: Beautiful Journey</h3>
<p>Italian Cargo Ships Sail to Shanghai as Usual</p>
<p>After the US Mail Steamship Company planned to stop the ships traveling between Europe and Asia due to the US government's imminent participation in the European war, it was learned from the reporter of the New Voice News Agency that ships of other neutral countries will continue to maintain navigation between Europe and the Far East. The transportation and loading of goods will not be affected by the suspension of Italian merchant ships.</p>
<p>The Italian cargo ship "Quirico Gluck" is currently berthed at the company's dock with empty cargo. However, the ship and the "Telamone" will continue to carry cargo to Europe. The "Quirico Gluck" is scheduled to sail to South China within the week, and the "Telamone" will come to Shanghai in the first week of next month. After a short stay in Shanghai, it will continue to sail to Europe. The various President ships of the American President Lines have decided to continue sailing between the Far East and Europe, maintaining normal navigation. The New Voice News Agency learned from the American</p>
<p>President Lines that the company's Adams, Garfield, Harrison, and Baker will come to Shanghai one after another this summer. The Garfield will set sail from Europe via the Suez Canal on June 15 to China. The Adams is scheduled to depart for China on July 17, the Harrison at the end of July, and the Baker on September 12. It is heard that the company also has three ships, the Hibaas, Mongolia, and Bayard, which will no longer pass through the Suez Canal in the future, but will instead take the Cape of Good Hope and travel between New York and the Far East via Manila, Hong Kong, and Singapore. It is also stipulated that these three ships will not call at Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Strict Crackdown on Rice Mixed with Inferior Goods</h3>
<p>Violators Will Be Punished According to Regulations</p>
<p>Previously, Shanghai's rice market was monopolized and manipulated by rice merchants, resulting in soaring prices. Some unscrupulous merchants still mixed inferior goods into high-quality rice, deceiving buyers and selling them at high prices, making profits that were indeed unscrupulous. The authorities of the two concessions have repeatedly strictly prohibited this. Now, most rice merchants have followed the regulations, but there are still many who ignore them. Recently, the authorities decided to strictly crack down on them. If the same incident occurs again in the future, they will be punished according to the regulations.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Trade Unions Send Joint Telegram to Salute Soldiers in Henan and Hubei; Successful Use of Novel Strategy Achieves Unprecedented Success; Growing Confidence that the Foundation for Final Victory is Solidified</h3>
<p>The Shanghai trade unions believed that the battle of Henan and Hubei, in which we achieved an unprecedented victory, was of great importance to the entire war situation. Therefore, yesterday, they sent a joint telegram to Commander Li Zongren and the soldiers on the front line to express their congratulations and condolences. The original telegram said: Commander Li Zongren De Lin, and transferred to all the officers and soldiers on the front line, Jianjian, in the battle of Henan and Hubei, we deployed our troops for thousands of miles, annihilated tens of thousands of enemies, and achieved unprecedented success with a novel strategy. The foundation for final victory has been further consolidated. When the good news came, the whole country rejoiced. The Shanghai trade unions, on behalf of their 800,000 members, send a remote telegram to express their congratulations and give the highest respect. Shanghai trade unions kowtow. Please note.</p>
<h3>Japanese Indulgence and Entertainment: A Sign of Decline; Japanese Youths in Hongkou Revel in Drinking and Singing; Domestic Poverty and War Fatigue; Soviet Far East Defenses Strengthen</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language *Continental News*, Aikawa, Deputy Director of the Japanese-Asia Institute's Central China Liaison Department, stated that Japanese youths residing in the Hongkou area of Shanghai have recently indulged in entertainment, reveling in drinking and singing, forgetting the hardships at the front lines and the perilous state of the nation. This kind of behavior, like the madness and decline of the fin de siècle, is not a good omen. Therefore, he issued a statement urging these people to reflect. According to yesterday's *Mainichi Shimbun* statistics, there are 70,000 Japanese residents in Shanghai, with 330 restaurants, 54 cafes, and 25 high-end restaurants. It can be seen that this kind of business is thriving. The Japanese people's frugality was once known throughout the world, but recently the atmosphere has suddenly changed.</p>
<p>According to someone who recently came to Shanghai from Japan, this kind of decadent atmosphere is also a general phenomenon in Japan. Since the invasion of China three years ago, the decline in foreign trade and the domestic economy approaching collapse have been undeniable facts. After the defeats of the Japanese army in northern Guangdong, Guangxi, northern Jiangxi, and northern Hubei, they could no longer count on military victories.</p>
<p>Politically,</p>
<p>the intention was to use the puppet "government" to resolve the China Incident, but this yielded no results. When Abe Nobuyuki was dispatched to China this time, he had great missions and hopes, but now he is heartbroken at the sight of the lack of prospects, which was completely unexpected. Therefore, Abe has closed his doors to guests in Nanjing, refusing to meet even important figures from the puppet regime, leading to</p>
<p>rumors that Abe</p>
<p>had already gone to Vietnam. Due to the above circumstances, the Japanese people feel the futility of the costly war of aggression and are oppressed by increasingly impoverished daily lives. Their war-weariness is deep, but they dare not openly oppose the war. Their hearts are filled with anxiety, and with no way to express it, they indulge in entertainment and drown their sorrows in alcohol as a form of anesthesia. This tragic scene is one that people both at home and abroad view with immense sympathy.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Fully Defends Against Japan</p>
<p>Recently, a Westerner came to Shanghai from Harbin and reported that although the Soviet Union is paying close attention to the European war, it has not relaxed its defenses against Japan in the slightest. The Soviet Union has not only strengthened the necessary military defenses along its Far Eastern border, but is also actively enriching its economic construction, striving to make the Far East self-sufficient and self-reliant, so that in the event of a need to fight on both the eastern and western fronts, the Far East will not have to rely on supplies from elsewhere in the country. The</p>
<p>heavy industry in the Far East is currently being rapidly expanded. For example, the large-scale ironworks in Somolysk, the ironworks in Chaote, and other factories under construction will all complete their construction ahead of schedule (according to the Third Five-Year Plan, they should be completed in 1942). The</p>
<p>arsenals and military supply factories in Khabarovsk are busy increasing production and stockpiling raw materials. The oil refinery in Khabarovsk has also begun operations. Regarding military transportation, the construction of a railway and its branch lines that run parallel to Siberia, winding westward for about 1,300 miles, is proceeding in great secrecy, but it is not far from complete. Regarding food, mechanization of agriculture is underway, and immigration is encouraged, with excellent results. The fact that some immigrants come from as far away as Ukraine shows the Soviet Union's active development of agriculture in the Far East. According to the Westerner's observation, although Japan and the Soviet Union both have a desire for rapprochement, the conflict of interests between them has become a barrier that is difficult to eliminate. Therefore, they both have to prepare to win in a possible future military conflict.</p>
<h3>Domestically Produced Goods Shipped to Southeast Asia: Sales Double</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Europe Relocate and Do Business; Patriotic Support and Promotion of Domestically Produced Goods</p>
<p>A reporter from the *New Voice News* learned yesterday from domestic goods organizations in this city that after the European war intensified, overseas Chinese residing in Europe have been flocking to various territories in Southeast Asia to do business. With a strong sense of patriotism, they are sparing no effort to boycott Japanese goods, vigorously promote domestic goods, assist local merchants, and strongly encourage the use of domestic goods. Whenever someone purchases domestic goods, they explain in detail the exquisite quality and durability of domestic goods. As a result, the shipping and sales of domestic goods to Southeast Asia have doubled, and they are quite popular with the local people. This greatly benefits the war of resistance and national reconstruction. It is understood that electrical appliances, enamelware, cotton textiles, and knitwear are the main products sold in the area. At a time when domestic factories are struggling to sell their products, the only outlet is to develop overseas markets, because overseas Chinese support domestic goods as much as people in the country do.</p>
<h3>Two Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>Slowdown at Jingxin Printing House; Workers at Bada Factory on Hunger Strike</p>
<p>Jingxin Bookstore</p>
<p>All workers at the Jingxin Printing House at 94 Glock Road went on strike due to unmet demands for improved treatment. It is understood that all workers at the printing house requested a 20 yuan increase in allowance in writing on the 21st of this month, because their wages were insufficient to maintain a livelihood. They also requested bathing facilities due to the hot weather. The employer did not reply, so the workers began a slowdown on the 24th. Yesterday, the employer notified all workers through a lawyer to complete the handover procedures, allegedly to replace them with new workers. However, all workers are still continuing to negotiate frankly with the employer in order to break the deadlock.</p>
<p>Bada Silk Factory</p>
<p>More than 70 workers went on a hunger strike after their request for a wage increase was denied. The Bada Silk Factory on Haining Road, Henan Road, is quite large, employing more than 150 people. Recently, as prices have risen even higher, the female workers in the preparation department and the machine operators found that their daily wages of 60-70 cents were not enough to live on. When their request to the employer was denied and they had nowhere to turn, more than 70 of them went on a hunger strike in the factory to awaken the employer. They also plan to ask the Industrial Section of the Municipal Council to mediate as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Staff Preparing for Salary Increase</h3>
<p>Personnel Committee Meeting Discussed</p>
<p>Due to soaring prices and difficult living conditions, Chinese and Western staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council are preparing for a salary increase. A reporter from *Pingming News* inquired about this matter with the Municipal Council. It is understood that the Municipal Council is quite aware of the common desire of its Chinese and foreign staff for a salary increase. However, as of recently, the Council staff has not made any collective formal demands or proposals. The Municipal Council is now considering it. The Municipal Council Personnel Committee held a meeting in the conference room at 5 p.m. the day before yesterday. Attendees included Personnel Committee members Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, Kana, McDonald, Herle, Powell, Mitchell, and Hana Yutaro, among other Chinese and foreign members. The motion discussed was that the salary increase for Chinese and foreign staff of the Municipal Council would be implemented after being approved by the next regular meeting of the Board of Directors.</p>
<h3>Another Agency Established to Control Vegetables and Local Produce</h3>
<p>In addition to the "Central Market" at the bridgehead of Xizang Road and the "Food Market" on Wusong Road, the Japanese puppet organization controlling vegetables and local produce in the city has recently created a "Shanghai Market," leading to intensified competition. Local vegetable and produce merchants are already facing ubiquitous traps and are in dire straits. The control methods of the "Shanghai Market" are similar to those of the "Food Market" on Wusong Road, levying a 3% tax on the cargo price "to allow merchants to operate freely." Its control extends to local produce transported to Shanghai via the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways. Transportation companies have immense power after transporting goods, and local produce merchants on both routes are caught in their net. Now that the "markets" are encroaching on each other, it is the general cargo merchants who suffer.</p>

<h3>Quakers' Friendship Society Shelters Homeless Children; Remarkable Success in Psychological Treatment; Unhappy Children Enjoy New Lives</h3>
<p>According to *Continental News*, the Quakers' Friendship Society, observing that street children are forced by circumstances to become petty thieves, established a "Reception Center" at No. 8, Lane 1086, Yu Yuan Road, to shelter homeless children and provide them with psychological "treatment." A reporter recently visited the center, which currently houses 17 children who are treated with great kindness. During the day, they either sit around a round table reading and writing, or gather in groups on the sunny lawn,</p>
<p>jumping and playing. Those who are ill receive medical treatment, and the bedding on the beds is clean and tidy. The matron of the center, Ms. Bella Hannah, is kind and friendly. When speaking with the reporter, she was wiping a child's wound. According to Ms. Bella, one-third of the homeless children have wounds on their bodies when they enter the center. They are first brought to the police station by the police, and are extremely frightened and dare not speak. After being sent to the "Reception Center," they are soothed with gentle words.</p>
<p>Their accounts of how they ended up on the streets are almost identical: either they were separated from their parents during the Shanghai war in 1937, or they were abused at home and ran away on their own, ending up on the streets, destitute and helpless, for several months before being sent here by the police. However, they refuse to say how they managed to survive for months on the streets. After arriving at the center, they see that everyone is friendly, and their anxieties disappear, and they happily begin their new lives. According to Ms. Chen, the caregiver at the center, there are no difficulties in accommodating these homeless children. If they are treated properly, then</p>
<p>they can easily be educated. The most difficult thing is to get the children to clean themselves when they first arrive at the center. The following incident can represent the past experiences of each of the children. There is a boy named Kong Hedi (transliteration), who is only seven years old. His appearance already shows signs of hardship. There are dark blue marks of beatings on his legs and body, which shows that he was severely treated by his stepmother at home. Unable to bear the suffering, he ran away and became a street child, and was soon</p>
<p>arrested by the police and sent to the "Reception Center." He will be sent back home after staying for about two weeks. The child claims that his home is near the No. 2 bus station and a butcher shop on Qiujiang Road. People from the Municipal Council's Child Protection Section will search for it according to the address and visit the "Reception Center" regularly. If the child's parents do not want him to return home, then he will be sent to an orphanage,</p>
<p>taught a skill, and be able to support himself. Now, in the "Reception Center," they are made to forget their criminal tendencies and encouraged to love cleanliness and self-sufficiency, such as making their beds and cleaning their bedrooms, and they are taught daily lessons. After two weeks, they are sent back home. As for the child's future, it will depend on himself.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Native Association Solicits Donations for Low-Priced Grain</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Native Association has established a fundraising committee to relieve the famine in its hometown. It has decided to raise one million yuan, divided into special donations and industry donations, soliciting donations from individuals and various industries. Kui Yanfang, Zhang Lianfang, Ding Fangyuan, Chen Qingzhao, Le Rucheng, Liu Liangcai, Ge Weian, and other seven people have been appointed as general managers from the standing committee, and they will be at the meeting every day to preside over the fundraising matters. They are soliciting donations separately every day, and donors are very enthusiastic.</p>
<p>The Three-North low-priced grain business is being managed diligently by the Three-North Shanghai Native Low-Priced Grain Association. Zhang Chude, representative of 560,000 people in northern Yao, sent a letter yesterday thanking Yu Qiaqing for his sincere concern for disaster relief. There were also letters from natives in northern Ci to Yu accusing village chiefs of deducting low-priced grain. According to a member of the low-priced grain association, the organization was originally founded by Yu Zhiqing and Shen Weiting, giants from the Three-North area in Shanghai. When the hometown was hit by a rice shortage and the village chiefs from various towns sent letters to Yu asking for low-priced relief, they enthusiastically donated in Shanghai Native Association. When they were hoping to continue purchasing rice for low-priced relief, they suddenly received letters from the people of northern Ci accusing the few village chiefs of taking the opportunity to deduct the quantity of low-priced rice, which was in violation of the original intention of five kilograms per person. For example, (1) Rong Shaopang, chief of Huodong Township in northern Ci, sold only three kilograms to each villager, privately selling the remaining two kilograms for personal gain; (2) Yu Ruizhang, chief of Huxi Township in northern Ci, sold only three kilograms and four taels or half a kilogram to each person; (3) Yang Qian, second village chief of Fuhai Township in northern Ci, sold only four kilograms and eight taels out of the five kilograms per person. If true, please send a letter directly to the local military and police authorities to arrest and punish them as a warning.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Port Import and Export Duty; Ningbo Has Already Stopped Collecting; Ningbo Shanghai Native Association Has Received Reply Telegram</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Party Bureau previously promulgated a method to raise funds for poor people's food. All cargo transported by commercial ships entering and leaving Ningbo Port and stored in warehouses would be subject to a relief fee of 5%. The Ningbo Shanghai Native Association sent two telegrams requesting a postponement, as the matter was tantamount to disguised additional taxes. According to a message from the association yesterday, the Ningbo side had been requested to raise funds for poor people's relief by other means and to cancel the 5% tax on goods. A reply telegram had been received from the Ningbo side, especially to stop it.</p>
<h3>Tap Water Surcharge to Increase Again Next Month; City's Hot Water Shops Request Preferential Treatment</h3>
<p>In view of soaring prices and increasing expenses, the Shanghai Waterworks Company has attached a revised budget for this year and submitted it to the Municipal Council last month, requesting that the current 50% surcharge on tap water be increased to 110% starting June 1st. The Council's Public Utilities Committee put it forward for discussion at its first meeting on the 9th of this month and it has been approved. After the news became public, users were shocked. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the *New Voice News*, the city's more than 500 hot water shops have always had preferential treatment for monthly water consumption, and the company has a very harmonious and close relationship with the shops. However, this time, the increase in water fees seems to have disregarded the preferential treatment for the hot water shops, so the shop owners are very apprehensive and have separately sent letters to the Shanghai Hot Water Industry Association, requesting them to prepare a document for negotiation in order to reduce the expenditure. It is understood that the reasons for their request are nothing more than the high price of coal, rising prices of all goods, and the difficulty in covering daily operating expenses. If the water price is doubled again, they will have to close their doors. For the sake of their future and the health of the citizens, they have no choice but to take this action, so they hope that the company will approve it within a possible range.</p>

<h3>Jian De Bank Bankruptcy Fraud Appeal</h3>
<p>Investigation of Evidence Not Permitted; Judge Recusal Requested</p>
<p>Wei Haijiang, Wang Ruyao, and other creditors of the Jian De Bank, filed a lawsuit against Xie Keming, the bank's director, and Yu Yuanxiang, the bankruptcy administrator, for bankruptcy fraud.

However, Yu Yuanxiang delayed for more than fifty days before handing them over, preventing Wei and others from having the opportunity to review them. During the court hearing the day before yesterday (the afternoon of the 24th), a request was made for an extension to allow for a detailed review. However, Chief Judge Nie Er, eager to close the case, denied the request and ordered the debate to begin immediately. Wei and Wang argued that Chief Judge Nie's leniency towards Yu Yuanxiang's delayed submission of documents and his eagerness to close the case deprived the creditors of the opportunity to thoroughly examine the evidence. Therefore, they will file a request for recusal.</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Emphasizes Children's Education</h3>
<p>Book Publications More Than Six Times Higher Than Before; National Experts Write for Children</p>
<p>(TASS) The Soviet Union places exceptional emphasis on children's education. In 1939, a total of 1,643 types of children's books were published, totaling 41 million copies, more than six times the number of books published during the Tsarist era.</p>
<p>These children's books are both beautiful and informative. The authors tell readers about reality and develop their will, creativity, and collective spirit. The style of famous Soviet writers such as Mayakovsky is all aimed at this goal.</p>
<p>Most children's books are about the evolution of civilization, natural history, and industrial development. Writers are not limited to famous writers, but also include scientists, inventors, and explorers, all of whom write for children.

<h3>Sichuan Province Provides Relief to Elementary School Teachers, Promotes "One Dou of Rice" Campaign</h3>
<p>One Dou of Rice Per Month in Addition to Salary</p>
<p>(Weiyuan Correspondence) The salaries of elementary school teachers in Weiyuan County were extremely low. Only after the establishment of the Education Subsidy Fundraising Committee this year were they modestly increased. The monthly salary for elementary school principals is 22 yuan, the monthly salary for elementary school teachers and short course elementary school principals is 20 yuan, and the monthly salary for elementary school teachers is 18 yuan, all paid according to the December standard. Although this is double the amount paid in the first half of 1939, the soaring prices have made the teachers' plight ten times worse than before. Due to budget constraints, the government has no additional funds to raise, and the teachers have no rice to cook, which will inevitably lead to the closure of schools, with far-reaching effects. Local party and government organs and community organizations in the county seat have launched a "One Dou of Rice" campaign as a remedy. County Magistrate Cheng personally wrote to the heads of various Lianbao (joint security units) to earnestly promote the campaign. The method involves the Lianbao heads convening meetings of local gentry and students' families to solicit donations, with the goal of providing each teacher in each school with one dou of rice per month in addition to their original salary. It is reported that several townships have widely promoted the campaign, and progress is proceeding smoothly.</p>

<h3>Zong Jing Cup Table Tennis Semifinals: Huayi A Holds Absolute Advantage</h3>
<p>Qingyun A Loses Again, Championship Hopes Dashed; Upset Occurs, Qingyun Xin Defeats Youbang</p>
<p>In the first match of the Zong Jing Cup table tennis semifinals the day before yesterday, Qingyun Xin pulled off another upset against Youbang. It was unexpected as Youbang had a strong lineup and was considered a top contender, but due to the absence of Rong Deneng, they suffered a 3-4 defeat against Qingyun Xin, which had an impact on their championship prospects. Youbang still has three matches remaining against Qingyun A, Post Office A, and Huayi A. If they can win all three matches, they will still need to compete with Huayi A in the final to determine the champion. In the first match, Huayi A easily defeated Gonghua 5-2. Yesterday evening at 7:00 PM, Huayi A played against Qingyun A. This match was crucial for both sides. If Qingyun A won, then Huayi A and Youbang would each have lost once, giving them hope for the championship. At the start of the match, Qingyun A took the lead with a burst of energy, winning three consecutive games. However, Huayi A did not lose heart and relied on their overall strength to reverse the situation and win 4-3, which was no easy feat. Huayi A has now won four matches in a row and holds an absolute advantage. The only team that can compete with them is Youbang. If Youbang can defeat Post Office A and Qingyun A in succession, they can still compete with Huayi A for the championship. Otherwise, even if Huayi A loses to Youbang, they will still be able to win the championship. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Qingyun Xin defeats Youbang 4-3</p>
<p>Huayi A defeats Gonghua 5-2</p>
<p>Huayi A defeats Qingyun A 4-3</p>

<p>Champions of Each Group Produced; Lido Defeats French Business Yesterday</p>
<p>The Zhendan Cup Small Alley Soccer Tournament saw Lido defeat French Business 4-2 in Group A1 yesterday, while Baimen was defeated by Youyou in Group A2. Portuguese Business forfeited, so Universe won without effort. As a result of the B Group playoff, the Russian Overseas Chinese Association, with its strong lineup, eliminated French Water and Electricity 5-2 and, along with the Jewish Association, secured the right to compete in the B Group overall championship final, which is scheduled to take place this Sunday (the 2nd).

<p>Lido Overwhelms French Business</p>
<p>French Business was only missing one player, Bao Xiu. The veteran Huang Mao Peier and Gem Huater formed a fierce forward line. "Ape" Willy guarded the goal. On the Lido side, Yan Shixin was limited by a foot injury and played goalkeeper, while Zheng Tongyu was active on the front lines. Under the leadership of Sun Jinshun, Lido, together with Meng Yiliang and Zheng Tongyu, formed a formidable offensive line. Shortly after the start of the match, Meng Yiliang scored, and Sun scored again, piercing the steel gate. Zheng Tongyu received a pass from Ah Cai and poked the ball into the upper right corner. The first half ended with Lido leading by three goals. After the switch, Meng Yiliang broke through the center, making it four to zero. After the big victory, Lido inevitably became negligent, and Jim managed to pass two goals. As a result, Lido won 4-2. Unfortunately, they missed the championship by one point (eight points), with the championship being taken by the Gelin Association (nine points). Lido's lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Yan Shixin, Jiang Chao, Zhang Lingen (up), Meng Yiliang (down), Cai Zhisen, Sun Jinshun, Meng Yiliang (up), Zhang Lingen (down), Zheng Tongyu</p>
<p>Youyou Defeats Baimen</p>
<p>Youyou and Baimen played very politely. Baimen has a lot of players, and they used them all. The lineup was new again yesterday. They temporarily pulled in the judge Zhang Le to make up the numbers. Both sides made it clear that if a goal was scored, it would not be counted. In the first half, Youyou only scored one goal by Hu Boyong, taking the lead 1-0. At the start of the second half, Baimen's midfielder Luo Lu scored, tying the game at 1-1. Youyou brought in new players, Zhou Qilin and Cao Qinfang, who scored two goals in a row, and Youyou won 3-1.</p>
<p>Youyou Association: Tao Ziming, Zhou Qilin, Chen Xiaoping, Wang Zhangbao, Wu Hao, Hu Boyong, Cao Qinfang, Shen Jinyuan</p>
<p>Baimen: Gu Dekui, Lu Dazhen, Zhou Zhi, Mao Hongfa, Zhang Le, Luo Lu, Xue Erfo</p>

<h3>From the Suspension of the Dutch Guilder in Shanghai to Foreign Currency Deposits</h3>
<p>— Mu Shensi</p>
<p>Since the German army invaded Dutch territory, the Shanghai Dutch guilder exchange market has been suspended (May 13th). Anyone holding Dutch guilder remittances or deposits, because there is no exchange rate to convert them into legal tender or other currencies, is temporarily unable to use them, which is tantamount to being detained. The damage suffered can be imagined. Furthermore, prior to the Dutch guilder, there was also the German mark, which had already been suspended last year (September 4th) due to the outbreak of the European war, and it has been nine months now. Fortunately, the trading of Dutch and German currencies in Shanghai was not significant, and the damage suffered was limited. Also, because few people knew about it, the general public did not pay much attention to it. However, the seriousness of its significance cannot be ignored. If the Dutch guilder and German mark have been suspended one after another, then due to the shift in the situation, how can we determine that other foreign currencies have no possibility of suspension? In the past, people in our country took storing domestic currency as a principle, and few people stored foreign currencies except for import and export merchants. But now it is different. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Nationalists have been scrambling to purchase foreign exchange. Initially, it was only for the escape of funds by the wealthy. Later, the Shanghai black market for foreign exchange shrunk, and those with weak wills mistakenly believed that the foundation of the legal tender was shaking. As soon as they had any assets, they rushed to purchase foreign currencies, thinking it was a good deal. It has come to the point where they are willing to purchase and store foreign currencies at four or five times the price, and the danger is something that those people cannot anticipate. I am not smart, but I have to speak out about what I think is dangerous, express my humble opinions, and hope to discuss it with readers:</p>
<p>The escape of funds is an unavoidable phenomenon during wartime, but at that time, there was only the Sino-Japanese War, and other countries were peaceful. Purchasing and storing foreign currencies may have been justifiable. Now, the European war is increasingly expanding, and our country may be affected. Once the situation changes and a certain currency is suspended, then those who have stored that currency will inevitably be caught off guard, be subject to being frozen, and it will be too late to regret. Those who have foreign currencies should consider this, this is the first point.</p>
<p>In this uncertain world situation, "exchange control" and "currency devaluation" are not only natural phenomena for losing countries, but also possible measures for winning countries. In other words, they are not only suitable for countries with financial difficulties, but also for countries with superior economies. For example, Italy has implemented exchange control, and Italian currency cannot be remitted abroad, which has been the case for several years. Another example is the US dollar, the currency of the wealthiest country in the world, which has already devalued by 59.06%, and there are widespread rumors that it may be devalued again due to the sharp drop in the British-American exchange rate. The "external value of a country's currency, whether too high or too low, is not appropriate." The so-called "control" and "devaluation" are the application of modern economic policies. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Some people think that depositing a certain currency in a local foreign bank is actually still deposited locally. This is a psychological illusion. According to the facts, all foreign currency deposits have already been remitted abroad. If an incident occurs in a certain country and the local currency is suspended as a result, then the money will inevitably be unable to be converted back into domestic currency. In other words, it will not be possible to withdraw the deposit, because it has been blocked by the foreign country. This must be known, this is the third point.</p>
<p>Some people say that buying and storing foreign banknotes is better than depositing foreign exchange, but everyone knows that any country's banknotes are only used domestically, and their value abroad is because of the exchange rate. Once a currency is suspended, the banknote will lose its value in the same way. The current Dutch banknote is a clear example. In the past, the victims of the bankruptcy of the Mark and Ruble were those who held them abroad, while Germany and Russia each had considerable gains. In addition, the value of banknotes is lower than the value of exchange, because interest, transportation, and insurance costs must be deducted. This is the case in peacetime, let alone during wartime when traffic is obstructed, and everyone suffers losses, especially with so few holdings.</p>
<p>Some people say that buying and storing gold bars is ultimately a tangible asset, which is the best way to go, but unbeknownst to you, gold has already been nationalized. The Shanghai environment is special, and the government's decrees are temporarily not in place, so there is a black market for gold, and its value has soared, exceeding the legal price of the central bank by several times. Even if the government does not confiscate it after the victory of the War of Resistance against Japan, but collects it at the legal price, the loss to the buyer is already considerable. Moreover, the United States is currently experiencing a panic over too much gold, and there are frequent arguments for lowering the price of gold. Those who have gold should also consider this, this is the fifth point.</p>
<p>Furthermore, recently the trend of foreign exchange is likely to rise. The main factors can be considered as four: (1) A certain party specializing in manipulating foreign exchange is now a supplier. It is said that this is to convert it into legal tender in order to collect local goods for export, so the sale of foreign exchange does not require purchase, and it can be supplied from this source. This is evidenced by the fact that a certain foreign bank has been selling spot goods and shorting futures for days, and this statement seems credible. (2) The world situation is deteriorating, and the funds of various countries' Far East territories, as well as the deposits of overseas Chinese in various places, are afraid of being controlled by the authorities, and they are coming to Shanghai for refuge in large numbers. (3) Banks of various countries that are currently involved in the European war, as well as banks in certain countries that are rumored to be about to join the war, will inevitably sell foreign exchange and convert it into legal tender to meet the withdrawals of depositors. (4) According to experts, the imports to Shanghai are decreasing and the outstanding foreign exchange is few. On the other hand, the peak season for exports has arrived, and in the future, the foreign exchange market will inevitably have excess demand. In addition to the above four points, the recent unprecedented victory in the Battle of Henan-Hubei has further strengthened the confidence of the people in the legal tender, which is another reason why foreign exchange is likely to fall and is difficult to rise in the future. Those who are good at speculating in foreign exchange have already seen this, and there is no need for me to elaborate. However, the general public has no connection with foreign exchange, does not know what foreign exchange is, and lacks economic common sense, let alone the reality and evolution of the world economic situation. These people may be confused by the profits of speculation, or injured by rumors, blindly follow the crowd, and rush to purchase foreign exchange or foreign banknotes, which is really reckless. Even if their foreign currency is fortunate enough not to encounter "suspension of exchange" or "devaluation," once the completion of the War of Resistance is achieved, the black market will end, and it will inevitably be settled at the legal exchange rate (one shilling and two and a half pence for British pound, twenty yuan for US dollar), then their assets will have already lost 70% to 80%. Why not, in today's situation where our country's military is progressing smoothly, convert the foreign currency into legal tender, invest in the Southwest under the leadership of the national bank, seek construction for the country, and create happiness for future generations, so that you can enjoy the rights of "guaranteed interest" and "profit sharing" (see the recent newspaper reports). Compared with storing foreign currency, using valuable financial resources to be used exclusively by foreigners, and being in an extremely dangerous world situation, where it is easy to suffer the risk of partial or total loss, is this not an obvious choice between wisdom and foolishness?</p>
<h3>How About the Future of Foreign Exchange (4)</h3>

<p>6. European War Expansion and the Future of the US Dollar (Issue 319) 12. The Maximum Extent of Japanese and Puppet Sabotage (This Issue)</p>
<p>Furthermore, the first paragraph of the ninth section was published in the previous issue. For the convenience of readers, it is republished here for consistency.</p>
<p>"Natural Level" and "Artificial Level"</p>
<p>There may be many people who are currently studying: "Is the current rate of three and a half pence per British pound and four yuan six eight seven five per US dollar the new natural level?" Some may even be trying to figure out, "How long will this level remain stable?"</p>
<p>According to their speculative experience, general speculators imagine that the so-called "natural level" must be a lower exchange rate than before. Therefore, every time there is a trend in the black exchange market, a new so-called "natural level" is produced; and each new "natural level" always causes the black exchange price to shrink by 10% to 20%. I think this is an insult to the "natural level." The spokesman of the Ministry of Finance often hopes that the black exchange market will generate a "natural level" in free fluctuations. If he also regards a lower exchange rate as a "natural level," it is also an unparalleled mistake.</p>
<p>According to the above-mentioned key factors in determining international exchange rates: the main factor in international exchange rates is not whether the monetary elements and currency values are balanced, but whether the trade in goods is balanced. To discuss the trend of trade balance, one should observe the trend of wartime trade according to the legal exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. If the black exchange price is used to calculate, then the result obtained is only a monetary phenomenon, only a price phenomenon, not the truth of trade in goods. Only from the truth of trade in goods can we discover how the main factors determining the exchange rate are changing, so we can judge whether the current black exchange market is reasonable? Is it in line with the meaning of the so-called "natural level?"</p>
<p>If this theory is correct, then the trend of trade balance in our country during the war is not only not worse than before the war, but also has made great progress compared with before the war. This progress is by no means a wild boast, because the new construction during the war is enough to offset part of the destruction under the flames of artillery fire, and high prices naturally save part of the consumption. If the situation in the interior is not enough to represent the situation in the whole country, then let's take a step back and take Shanghai's foreign trade in the occupied areas as an example. Shanghai's trade has always accounted for more than half of the total trade in the country. Then, the actual performance of Shanghai's trade balance should powerfully affect the trend of international exchange rates.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign trade has always shown a deficit of more than 200 million to 500 million yuan. But since the start of the war, the deficit has gradually been reduced. For example, in the 26th year of the Republic [1937], it was reduced to 105 million yuan, in the 27th year [1938] it was reduced to 47 million yuan, and in the 28th year [1939], it changed from a deficit to a surplus of more than 11 million yuan. Although this does not include private imports, the quantity of private exports is probably even greater than private imports. The progress of this trade balance is precisely the best condition reflected in the foreign exchange market. So if we want to talk about the "natural level," it should be a higher exchange rate, not a lower exchange rate. And the current exchange rate? It can only be said to be an "artificial level."</p>
<p>From the actual balance of trade in goods: this "artificial level" has clearly created the effect of suppressing imports. But from the perspective of monetary phenomena: it has caused great losses to importers. That is, they pay a lot of money, but import less goods than in the past. Therefore, from the monetary phenomenon, that is, according to the black exchange price to observe Shanghai's current trade balance, it is not only still a deficit, but also an unprecedentedly large deficit. The currency value of the deficit in the 28th year [1939] is as high as 850 million yuan.</p>
<p>Trade in goods is actually a surplus, but the reflection on the monetary balance sheet forms an unprecedented deficit. The unreasonableness of this monetary phenomenon can be imagined: the black exchange market has created this unreasonable phenomenon. Therefore, if people want to ensure your wealth, there is only one way: do not contact the black exchange market. Therefore, when the government implements a low exchange rate policy towards the black exchange market in order to adjust the international balance of payments, those who are hit are only the Japanese and puppets who try to buy up our foreign exchange. Because the target of the government's attack under this policy is the Japanese and puppets, not the general public. If someone thinks that the legal tender is depreciating because of entering and exiting the black exchange market, in fact, the general legal tender has not depreciated. What has depreciated is only the legal tender that enters and exits the black exchange market. This is self-inflicted, and they can only blame themselves. If the Japanese and puppets' buying and speculators' activities in the black exchange market stop, then the black exchange price will inevitably rise naturally in the trade balance that is determined by trade in goods. This is the "natural level" in the black exchange market. In short: as long as the artificial pressure on the black market is reduced, then it will jump up.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Value and Speculative Profits</p>
<p>With the fall of the black exchange price, the value of foreign currencies seems to have risen sharply on the surface. Those who hoard foreign exchange also seem to have made a lot of money on the surface. For example, if they bought US$5.75 with 100 yuan of legal tender on May 1st, and on May 3rd, the US dollar has shrunk to 4.3125 yuan. Then his US$5.75 can buy 133.3432 yuan of legal tender. It seems that he has earned more than 33 yuan out of thin air. But unbeknownst to them, those US$5.75 were only worth 15.15 yuan of legal tender in the 2nd year. When he bought those US$5.75 with 100 yuan of legal tender, he actually lost more than 80 yuan of legal tender. If he now saves the 133.3432 yuan of legal tender he gets back, he will be able to buy more than 40 US dollars in the future. If you have to go to the United States to study right away, then with the approval of the Ministry of Education, the central bank can still sell you 20 to 30 US dollars right away after deducting the balance fee. So you seem to be making money by entering and exiting the black exchange market, but in reality, you are losing your capital greatly. The more times your legal tender enters and exits the black exchange market, the greater the loss to your actual property.</p>
<p>If you can understand historical facts, then you must remember: if a country's government has already destroyed foreign exchange, I will. Once it acts, it can restore the original state immediately. Like Germany and the Soviet Union, no matter how many millions of times the value of their rubles and marks has fallen below zero, as soon as their policies change, they will be reorganized in an instant. Moreover, the legal tender of China has not experienced currency inflation at all. China's human, material, and financial resources are much more abundant than those of Germany and the Soviet Union, so it is even easier to restore the original state. Can you say that the national spirit of China is not as good as that of Germany and the Soviet Union? What's more, China's war target is a paper tiger that is about to be torn apart. Compared to the enemies that Germany and the Soviet Union encountered at that time, it is simply insignificant.</p>
<p>Not only is the restoration of the true value of the legal tender inevitable, but the true value of foreign currencies is also about to be "revealed." The rise in foreign currencies in the black exchange market is not an increase in the true value of foreign currencies, but is reflected by the apparent depreciation of the legal tender in the black exchange market. The consequences of this reflection have added another layer of serious blow to the commercial status of European and American countries in China in addition to the exclusion of Japan. Look at the table below: In the import trade of China in the 26th and 28th years of the Republic [1937 and 1939], the proportion occupied by each country has only increased from 17.36% to 34.39% for Japan alone, and almost all others have decreased significantly. For example, the United Kingdom has decreased sharply from 11.68% to 5.80%: the United States has decreased sharply from 19.75% to 15.94%; France has decreased sharply from 1.58% to 0.84%; even Germany and Italy are being rejected in the same way. Germany has dropped from 15.31% to 6.49%, and Italy has also dropped from 1.04% to 0.83%. Except for Japan, no other country will be satisfied with this phenomenon. In other words: the existence of the black exchange market is a big loss for European and American groups and China, except for the convenience of Japan. However, European and American countries can temporarily take comfort in the fact that they can exchange a small number of goods for valuable prices for the time being. However, in the current drastic changes in the international political situation, countries that change monetary policies for political, military, and other reasons will probably emerge like bamboo shoots after a rain. The currencies of European warring countries are in danger, which goes without saying. Even the US dollar, how can it be unique? In the "European War Expansion and the Future of the US Dollar" section, it was pointed out that "the United States may not necessarily join the war immediately, but economic assistance to the Allied forces is necessary." Judging from the stability of the British-American exchange rate today, which is no longer as rapidly changing as before, it is probably a way for him to assist the Allied forces?</p>
<p>The Maximum Extent of Japanese and Puppet Sabotage</p>
<p>As for the sabotage of the Japanese and puppets, it is not to be feared. Because they are already "willing but unable." Everyone knows: to sabotage, you need to have the strength to sabotage; the so-called strength is that you must first prepare a huge amount of legal tender capital before you can jump into the black market and snatch wildly. In the past: he used guns to force the people of North China to hand over legal tender, and the handed over legal tender has already been looted and has been exhausted by him, and the hoarded legal tender has been hoarded to the point where he cannot loot it. Therefore, one of the sources for him to obtain large amounts of legal tender has now disappeared. As for Central and Southern China, because the foundation of the legal tender among the people is deeper, he has to abandon his dream of "eliminating the legal tender" and adopt the policy of "using the legal tender." In this way, although he obtains legal tender by exporting to China, in order to plunder China's native products, he still has to spit out legal tender. Therefore, the possibility of collecting legal tender from the trade aspect is far less than what people generally imagine. It is true that the customs duties have been seized, and more than 10 million yuan of legal tender can be obtained every month. But precisely because they have already learned not to "use the legal tender," therefore all of this legal tender has not been used to buy up foreign exchange. Therefore, although they have been planning to buy up foreign exchange, they are in fact restricted by the legal tender. In the past, every time they snatched foreign exchange, they had to go through a considerable period of time to prepare for the gathering of legal tender. In the future, this preparation time will of course be longer than in the past. No matter how long it takes him to collect legal tender, when he starts to buy up foreign exchange, if speculative Chinese merchants do not follow him to buy up at the same time, then his sabotage power will inevitably be weaker. Restraining the machine and following the Japanese and puppets to buy up foreign exchange is only helping the Japanese and puppets to boost the momentum of sabotaging the foreign exchange market; and it is also asking for trouble. Because the government has temporarily suspended supply in order to prevent the Japanese and puppets from buying up, and the original target of the attack is the Japanese and puppets. Speculators follow the Japanese and puppets to buy up, wouldn't they be asking for losses themselves? If only the Japanese and puppets are buying up and speculators do not follow, then although the situation will be temporarily tight due to the government's temporary suspension of supply, the tight situation will not be greater, and the rebounding force after the pressure is released will definitely be greater. This can be imagined.</p>
<p>Similarly; in order to satisfy his desire to "get promoted and make a fortune," the puppet side does have the intention of wantonly issuing small exchangeable banknotes to facilitate his plan to squeeze the people's fat and cream. However, the failures of "joint banknotes" and "China coupons" are precedents. This kind of waste paper does not help his pockets, so why bother? The reason why the puppet "central bank" has no opening date is this. However, since they came to power through looting, they will definitely do it regardless of success or failure as long as there is a possibility of looting. But it is harmless to the legal tender and harmless to foreign exchange, which is already obvious.</p>
<h3>A Way Out of the Impending Demise of Speculation</h3>
<p>— Cao Zhenzhao</p>
<p>Since the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation abandoned maintaining the exchange rate of 4 1/8 on the second of this month, the British and American exchange rates have reached new peaks again. The black market premium reached 7,300 yuan. Foreign stocks have also risen to an extreme, with some exceeding ten or twenty times their face value. Within a single day, the market price of daily necessities has increased by more than 20%, and there are even doubts about changes to the legal tender's status. Therefore, in addition to the black market, there is also a gray market. In addition to official quotations, there are also unofficial quotations. The situation is erratic, beyond the power of words to describe. However, within just one week, Germany suddenly launched a blitzkrieg, entering France through the Netherlands and Belgium. The world economy underwent a major change. The British and American exchange rates once fell below 2.9 yuan, and American stocks plummeted for days, especially industrial stocks, which fell to an average of over 20 pounds. As a result, the Shanghai foreign exchange market suddenly lengthened, and the various foreign stocks of public associations fell sharply. Other markets also fluctuated erratically, without any fixed timing. The rise and fall of foreign exchange rates depend on the volume of import and export goods, and the high and low of stock prices depend on the development of the business itself, which no one can control. However, the various markets in Shanghai have become places monopolized by speculators. When domestic and international situations change, speculators take the opportunity to fuel the flames, manipulating the market. The general public, unaware of the dangers, mistakenly fall into their trap, suffering huge losses. On March 25th, I published an article in the economic supplement of this newspaper, analyzing the situation of foreign exchange premiums and stocks, and warned against speculation, intending it as a loyal admonition, which readers should still be able to recall. Unexpectedly, in less than two months, the positions of bulls and bears have already changed. In all fairness, the key to today's various markets in Shanghai lies in the current international situation. For example, when HSBC abandoned the 4 1/8 exchange rate, the U.S. dollar naturally tended to contract, but its momentum was not rapid. The speculators caused it to contract rapidly. When Germany used military force in France, all U.S. markets fell, and the U.S. dollar naturally lengthened, but its momentum was not rapid. The speculators also caused it to lengthen rapidly. Therefore, the so-called stocks, premiums, and various goods, whether high or low, are all determined by the trend of speculators. Once the speculators make a move, the general public follows suit. However, the opportunity for victory or defeat is determined in an instant. Often, speculators have already turned short into long, while the general public still sees short. Speculators have already turned long into short, while the general public still holds long. The difference between buying and selling is vast, beyond the expectation of the general public. It should be known that China uses legal tender as its standard. Since successive victories have been reported from the front lines, the status of legal tender has been invisibly elevated, and it has no relationship with the black market foreign exchange. Even the need to purchase foreign exchange for imported foreign goods is only a temporary need. Given the current treacherous international situation and frequent requisitions of foreign ships, international trade will gradually decrease in the future, and the need for foreign exchange will also gradually decrease. Anyone who is not engaged in import business must not purchase foreign exchange again, hastening their demise. Even those who have already purchased various goods should consider the market situation and not hoard them again. As for gold, it will inevitably be purchased by the state in the future, and there is no interest to speak of, while foreign stocks that can receive interest should not be underestimated. If one can maintain a firm principle and not give speculators an opportunity to exploit, the market will stabilize and finance will be secure. Although speculators are tigers, the floating capital is what makes them strong. According to external statistics, this kind of floating capital is indeed over 500 million yuan, a large part of which comes from mainland Chinese who have taken refuge in Shanghai. In this time of rising living costs and great difficulty in living, relying solely on deposits to earn meager interest from banks is not enough to maintain livelihood. Occasionally engaging in speculation to make a small profit is understandable. If there is a truly profitable path, they would not resort to risky and侥幸计策.</p>
<p>As for the general salaried class, seeing the daily increase in the cost of living, dazzled by high profits, forgetting the dangers, blindly following, if they are lucky enough to profit, the gains are minimal. If they are unfortunate enough to lose, they will inevitably be ruined and still not have enough, then their situation is even more pitiful. I believe that the way to health is to cultivate self-discipline, view wealth and status as fleeting clouds, and never be drawn into the whirlpool again, bringing trouble upon oneself, and especially not to turn long into short again, repeating the same mistakes. As for those who have cash or foreign exchange on hand but have no way to use it, one, it is best to deposit foreign exchange in the bank for a fixed period to earn interest, which can both ensure safety and generate interest. The bank will give preferential interest rates depending on the length of the fixed deposit. Two, if suffering from excess floating capital, the bank can open a special trust department to introduce investments in mainland factories, or provide planning and operational methods on preferential terms, and operate various mainland businesses on their behalf, and the bank or government can guarantee interest, transforming useless floating capital into useful capital. Three, if transferring funds to the mainland for deposit, the bank can offer preferential water rates and deposit interest rates according to the market. If the interest is to be used as living expenses, the matured interest can still be remitted to Shanghai at the original remittance fee and paid in legal tender. If, after a certain period of fixed deposit, one still wishes to withdraw funds in Shanghai, the bank can also remit the funds in full, subject to minimal restrictions. Moreover, if the remittance fee is longer than before, it can be calculated according to the new remittance fee, and vice versa, it can be calculated according to the old remittance fee, to show preferential treatment. The above points are just a brief outline, and the detailed plan should be carefully discussed by various economic experts. As for arbitrage with thick Taiwan interest rates, it is enough to promote the wind of speculation, and if the difference is too large, the risk is extremely high, and it should not be done. If floating capital can have a stable home, then the various industries and markets in Shanghai will be stable, and the production businesses in the mainland will also prosper. Those who possess floating capital, in this sound of rising exchange rates, falling gold prices, and falling goods prices, learning from past mistakes, should know where to go and what to do, without needing my verbose advice.</p>
<p>To Mr. Qu: Your letter has been forwarded to the China National Economic Research Institute. Where should the institute's publications be sent? Please let me know. Sincerely, Zhang Yifan</p>

<h3>Silver Inflation Intensifies</h3>
<p>Bombay, 25th - The Indian silver market is strong, with spot and afternoon monthly contracts each rising sharply by 19 annas compared to the previous day. July contracts also rose by 18 annas. A total of 150 contracts were traded. The British and American silver markets are closed for the weekend as usual.</p>
<h3>Sugar Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained soft. The guild's spot price for 24 crude white goods ex-godown was 65 yuan 8 jiao to 9 jiao, a slight increase of 3-4 jiao. Transshipment goods arriving on June 1st were 53 yuan 8 jiao to 5 jiao, and those with godown receipts dated May 28th were 52 yuan 6 jiao, both rising by 2-3 jiao. Taikoo refined white sugar continued to decline, with little activity in B-mark transactions. The actual market price is unlikely to exceed 80 yuan. The sales of national sugar are also low, and the company still has goods on hand, so there are no new offers. It is said that activity may only resume after the festival.</p>
<h3>Orchid Rice Price is High</h3>
<p>According to letters from the orchid rice producing areas, the price is relatively high due to demand from Hong Kong, so there have been no shipments to Shanghai for a long time. Judging from the production price, it is almost 20 yuan higher than the previous price in the Shanghai market, so there have been no further arrivals. Checks show that the grade A stock has run out, and only grade B goods remain, but they are not very marketable.</p>
<h3>Yantai Shrimp Tails are Fresh</h3>
<p>New Yantai Longxu Island shrimp tails have already appeared on the market. Several pieces have arrived recently. The opening price for the first batch was 320 yuan. Yesterday, two more pieces arrived, with excellent quality and color, priced at 360 yuan. Both parties are in discussion and have not yet reached a deal.</p>
<h3>Pepper Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Recently, the exchange rate for pepper has risen sharply, and the inventory here is also quite full, so the market is seeing a continued decline. Currently, black pepper and number one pepper are both sold for 118 yuan, and white pepper is sold for 205 yuan to 190 yuan, a further small decrease of 5 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3>Binding Wire Prices Soar, New Discs Remain Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>Binding Wire: The binding wire market is exceptionally strong due to the lack of new arrivals and low inventory. Holders are unwilling to sell at low prices due to environmental factors, and the market situation is excellent. Buyers remain enthusiastic, including construction gangs, machinery factories, and Tianjin merchants. As a result, due to cost and market trends, prices have soared, rising from 62 yuan to 65 yuan per dan, and then from 65 yuan to 68 yuan. It is estimated that 300-400 dan were traded yesterday.</p>
<p>New Discs: Most new discs come from countries such as Britain, Belgium, Germany, and the United States. Since the expansion of the European war, the routes from the first three countries have been cut off. Currently, only the United States can ship to Shanghai, but transportation is quite difficult, and freight rates have doubled. The market price after arrival in Shanghai will undoubtedly increase. Although trading in recent shipments has been very quiet, standards remain firm and expensive. The reason for this is undoubtedly as described above. The current asking price is around 70 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Wool Prices Remain Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>On May 2nd, the black market exchange rate rose sharply, pushing from 4 offices to nearly 3 offices, causing significant changes in prices throughout the city. Wool, being an imported product, was also affected. On one hand, Western-style clothing customers and tailors rushed to buy from wool merchants, and on the other hand, wool merchants also hurriedly announced price increases. Yifeng announced a 30% increase, Lianxing announced a 25% increase, and Meifa, Yida, Lianyi, etc., also announced separate price increases of 20% for new spring samples. Although the surface appeared tense and panicked, business actually improved greatly compared to the previous day, with daily transaction figures exceeding 10,000 yuan between the 2nd and 4th.</p>
<p>In the past few days, several Italian ships arriving from Europe have brought in a lot of wool yardage, such as panpiqu, fan'erding, ma jiaobu, and various thin summer wool fabrics. Suddenly, the entire wool market, which had been filled with simple old goods, was given a fresh look. This should have been a time of increasingly frequent wholesale transactions, but the black market exchange rate in Shanghai suddenly turned, first gradually easing, and then as yarn, flowers, gold, etc., gradually fell back, all parties seemed to unanimously hope that the wool market price would ease. However, no matter how eager the hope was, the market price remained firm and expensive, without any signs of easing. Inquiries with industry insiders revealed that the European war is only expanding, and transportation of European goods will become more difficult in the future, with no increase. If Italy declares war, wool will almost disappear from the Far East. It is difficult to expect prices to fall.</p>
<p>Currently, general market prices are as follows: American Sijigen requires around 30 yuan per yard, and ordinary panpiqu generally costs more than 30 yuan per yard. Fan'erding is nearly 40 yuan per yard, and single-width majiaobu is around 20 yuan per yard, generally five or six times higher than the same period last year, which can be said to be dramatic.</p>

<p>New York, May 25th - The stock market today saw reduced trading, but prices were quite firm. Speculators are awaiting President Roosevelt's speech tomorrow, in which he will outline the broad outlines of economic and military national defense plans. When military procedures are fully implemented, the need for metals, especially steel, will increase. Roosevelt's speech will likely immediately stimulate purchases of , aircraft, paper, rubber, and aviation stocks rebounded. Automobile stocks were stable, and retail stocks saw mixed ups and downs.</p>

<h3>Water Ghost</h3>
<p>South of the Red Bridge outside Xumen, a boatman named Jia, nicknamed "Water Ghost," was so named because he was good at swimming. On the 20th of last month, due to the continuous spring rain, the river suddenly flooded, and the fish in the harbor were submerged by the water. Jia took off his clothes and entered the water to arrange things, but he had just gone into the water when he suddenly jumped up, looking embarrassed and hesitant, appearing quite frightened. When asked the reason, he said that there was a ghost haunting the place, with immense power, difficult to fight against. After getting up, people gave him wine to calm his nerves and mocked him, saying, "I have heard of people being afraid of ghosts, but I have never heard of ghosts being afraid of ghosts. Your name is Water Ghost, but you are afraid of the ghost in the water. That is not living up to your name, and you will be laughed at not only by people but also by ghosts." At that time, someone was already drunk. Hearing this, he suddenly got up and jumped into the water. The boat was afraid of accidents, and they quickly followed him, but there was no trace of either of them. The next day, someone's body was found in the position of the fish , with the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose all blocked with mud.</p>
<h3>Gas Lamp Leaks</h3>
<p>At 10 o'clock on the fifth night, the Jin Guixuan Theater was performing a drama when the gas lamp at the second entrance suddenly dimmed and brightened. It was found that the iron pipe was cracked, and the gas company was immediately notified to repair it and the main gas valve was closed. After that, nothing happened, but at that time, the audience was already panic-stricken.</p>

<h3>The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of the Dutch</h3>
<p>— Tong Dai</p>
<p>The Netherlands, this low-lying country, has now fallen due to the German invasion. Here, what I want to talk about is the clothing, food, housing, and transportation of the Dutch. Because the customs of the Dutch in these aspects are different from those of other countries.</p>
<p>Clothing: The clothing of Dutch farmers and fishermen varies greatly depending on the region. The world-famous old-fashioned Dutch clothing, such as wooden shoes, big-legged trousers, laced aprons, wind hoods with high fronts, and small hats with upturned sides, can often be seen in the coastal provinces, especially on the islands. However, after the war, even the young people in those places have a tendency to reject the national-style clothing.</p>
<p>Food: The coastal areas of the Netherlands have fertile land in the farms and produce a lot of products, so the Dutch can't eat all the sugarcane, sweet potatoes, and beans. Because cattle farming is quite developed in the Netherlands, butter and cheese are produced in large quantities every year and have become common foods for the Dutch. Fresh or canned milk can be bought everywhere. Poultry is also quite abundant. In short, the Dutch people are very comfortable in terms of food. There is an annual banquet held on a fixed date. On that day, it is even more lively, and everyone will eat a big meal!</p>
<p>Housing: Although the Netherlands does not produce stone materials, it has built many solemn and magnificent houses and other buildings. The capital, The Hague, has elegant scenery and a bureaucratic atmosphere. The streets are wide, the waterways are crisscrossed, and the royal palace, parliament, and government are all located there. There are also many wealthy residences. Amsterdam is the most internationally styled city in the Netherlands, and new modern buildings can be seen everywhere. The large shipyard in this place is very famous. The Dutch nation has three components: the Frisians living in the coastal provinces, the Saxons living in the east, and the Franks living in the south, each with slightly different characteristics.</p>
<p>Transportation: Transportation in the Netherlands, whether by water or land, is very convenient, especially the industry, which is quite developed. Modern means of transportation, such as ships, trains, and cars, can be seen everywhere. What is particularly noteworthy is that bicycles can be seen everywhere. The Wenningen seaside resort, three miles from The Hague, is a famous place in Europe, with neat, tree-lined avenues leading to The Hague. However, Rotterdam, the first commercial city, has streets that are not very clean, and compared with Amsterdam, it is far behind and has a Dutch style.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Men's Summer Clothing</h3>
<p>— Er Dong</p>
<p>Recently, the Youth Association issued a notice soliciting improved styles of men's summer clothing. The reason is that women's clothing all over the world is light and comfortable, while men wear suits with stiff collars, and Chinese men wear long robes that drag on the ground. These are extremely unsuitable for summer wear. Therefore, there is this proposal. The principles are: comfort, beauty, elegance, and economy. The procedure is: draw a new clothing design, with address and phone number, and submit it to the Qunyubu of the Youth Association before June 30th. The department will adopt the design and award prizes.</p>
<p>Indeed, existing summer clothing is extremely cumbersome to wear, especially when going out for social occasions. Wearing a suit or Chinese attire is undoubtedly extremely uncomfortable, but it is unavoidable. In the past, some people advocated a movement to shorten long robes, but it was unsuccessful and soon became silent. This time, the Youth Association has come out with a proposal. If there is a perfect style, it will be easier to see results. We sincerely place our hopes on it.</p>
<p>Let's examine the four principles: economy should be the first priority, so that it can indirectly reduce the difficulty for poor scholars to prepare expensive silk clothes, while at the same time not harming their appearance. A suit costs at least dozens of yuan, and the situation is the same. As for comfort, it should be based on spaciousness. I think beauty and elegance should be said in reverse, as long as it is not ugly.</p>
<p>However, men's clothing has rarely changed, so this improvement will be very difficult. This depends on the efforts of the promoters, and the style that is agreeable to the public depends on how well it is designed.</p>
<h3>The Great Xu Garden</h3>
<p>— A Letter from Willow Seed Village, Holland</p>
<p>I wish you could transform into countless incarnations, radiating light on "clothing, food, housing, and transportation."</p>
<p>Three lifetimes of quiet grass dreaming of Hangzhou. Playing as immortals, butterflies with Zhuang Zhou. Dew-covered trees in the Cold Food Festival, weeping tears. Suddenly, teaching green to fill all of Western Europe. (Xu Garden passed away in the drizzle of March 24th, the twenty-ninth year of the Republic, and old friend Shou Juan went to see him off. The news reached Western Europe, and the flowers and trees in the courtyard, just touched by the green of the overnight rain, felt it ten thousand miles away, responding like an echo.) Zipi's wealth was said to be unmatched. Chen Shuo's literary talent excelled in foreign studies. Science as the soul, art as the bones. New opportunities bloom like strange flowers in the sea. (The Invincible brand tooth powder and cosmetics produced by the family industry society, striving to protect rights and interests, are praised far and wide. The scientific papers specially written on clothing, food, housing, and transportation possess people with exquisite and insightful artistic talent.)</p>
<p>Together with Guan Zhong and Yi Ya, they were passed down. Clouds and rosy clouds crossing the sea, extraordinary talent. Cities, landscapes, the abode of Ding Ling. When will you return, transformed into a crane, writing poetry? (Tian Xu, I, born traveling in Yunnan, composed four poems expressing feelings and responding to his son, with the line "Wading into gardens, I willingly enter dreams.") This journey may lead to Pan Lanshi. In the next life, become another Thomas Edison. Let's wait and see China emulate France and America. Crab-walking script reciting the name of Xu Garden. (French and English are both written horizontally, and "crab-walking script," if translated into English derived from Latin, can be called CancerScript). Thanks to Mr. Shou Juan's invitation to a feast, I had the opportunity in December of the fourteenth year of the Republic to catch a glimpse of Xu Garden's demeanor. (Xu Garden recorded this event, which appeared in the Shanghai Pictorial on December 6th of that year.) Xu Garden's wit and charm were somewhat similar to Mr. Zhou Bonian, the former supervisor of the World Society before the founding of the Republic. The two men were of similar age and came from similar backgrounds, and both held positions in Shanghai as cultural pioneers. A feeling of empathy naturally arose. Xu Garden's planning was meticulous and his experience was extensive. He first created the Cuili Company in Baoshu Fang in Hangzhou, where culture was flourishing, setting a precedent for our cultural men's national goods enterprise. He also joined forces with Pan Lanshi and others, lyricists from Guilin and the sea, to publish magazines that explored literature and art. Amidst laughter and music, peach and plum trees filled his courtyard, and looking at him was like seeing an immortal. However, his ambition ultimately lay in seclusion and introspection, regretting that he never presided over the forum of a world-class city. He traveled back and forth between Shanghai and Hangzhou many times, and when his ambitions finally succeeded and his skills flourished over the years, those who loved him were even more delighted. Therefore, I say that Xu Garden's struggling journey, in our revitalizing China, should be emulated by countless young people seeking a way out. Indeed, China's greatest problems are the three major diseases of poverty, ignorance, and weakness. Summarizing Xu Garden's life, there are three noteworthy characteristics. He was able to revitalize industry to alleviate poverty, first. He was able to pursue science to cure ignorance, second. He was proficient in poetry and prose, and like Dongfang Shuo, he had a broad knowledge of foreign books. All of his writings were able to fully express the "three-dimensional" nature and powerful characteristics of Chinese characters, surpassing the young people who mistakenly treated Chinese as a foreign language and only knew how to draw out "long hemp threads." He, who did not know foreign languages, was able to demonstrate the value of science with such skill, never showing weakness, third.</p>
<p>In the past, during the great chaos of the Five Dynasties, someone looked up to a dog and silently prayed, saying, "I wish for a sage to be born soon." Today, China suffers from poverty, ignorance, and weak will and ability. If someone considers the rise and prosperity of the country's future, they will surely say, "I wish Heaven would give birth to countless more like Xu Garden, to advance the promotion of saving the country through science." The most important thing about a country's talent is to avoid gold being concentrated in one corner, unable to spread far and evenly. The sixteen-character motto of guidance and education for the two-poem singing guest Chen Lifu, namely "self-confidence and belief, self-governance and management, self-nurturing and nurturing others, self-defense and defending the country," can only be achieved if people in the field each live according to Xu Garden's mandate, so that the court and the field can cooperate and complement each other. Zhejiang has two Chens, and their principles are the same.</p>
<p>Moreover, I have often read the histories, reports, and annals of advanced countries. Western writers cannot avoid bias in their appreciation of famous figures, ancient and modern. At the extreme, they would say, "Powerful countries have people, while outside of powerful countries, there are mostly no people." One day, when China strengthens itself and eliminates the three major diseases of poverty, ignorance, and weakness, then Xu Garden's name will not only be written in crab-walking script and valued by foreign historians, but he will also transform into countless incarnations, spreading throughout the country, like Edison across the Pacific Ocean, rising to illuminate modern science.</p>
<p>What is even more remarkable is that I heard that Xu Garden was able to predict his own death at 10:00 AM. This is truly a unique event in the history of science, and should be explained from a scientific perspective. Today's Western medical experts, based on statistics, deeply believe that the time and season of death can be predicted like a barometer. Dr. F. Nettesheim's theory differs slightly from others, stating that the most dangerous time for a person to die is the first hour after midnight. (i.e., the beginning of Zi Zheng and Chou in Chinese time). The next most dangerous time is from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. (Yi Zheng until Wei Chu). The third most dangerous time is from 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM. (from You Chu to Xu Zheng). Conversely, one hour before these dangerous times is the safest time with the fewest deaths. Xu Garden's passing, unfortunately coinciding with the predicted 10:00 AM, and my nostalgic poem from the sixteenth year, "Clouds dreary, wind dark at 1:00 PM," are both coincidences with the law of the next most dangerous time. Furthermore, according to Dr. Luo An's estimation, December and January in the Gregorian calendar are the most dangerous seasons for deaths in European countries. Conversely, April, June, and September are the three months with the fewest deaths. However, examining the world's weather, conditions vary greatly from place to place. The humidity of the earth's atmosphere most significantly affects the weather, and the weather can thereby increase or decrease diseases and deaths. The ancients' so-called miasma, dismissed as absurd by microbiologists, is now gradually seen to be reliable and evident when comparing statistics of diseases and deaths. However, the old Chinese saying that deaths are most numerous in the seven days, three days before and four days after the twenty-four solar terms, remains a mystery that science has yet to unravel. Recently, [someone]'s passing occurred four days after the Spring Equinox, coincidentally aligning with the Chinese saying. It is a pity that the wise man has passed away, and I cannot share [this understanding] with him, discussing this matter together.</p>
<p>Attached is Ms. Gu Qingyao's poem mourning her teacher, Xu Garden:</p>
<p>The mountain collapses, the tree decays, writing mournful words. Crying aloud, losing my respected teacher at the bedroom door. His surviving writings are worthy of being passed down like the Nine Tripod Cauldrons. His established words are revered like the Tai Qiu Stele. Trying to surpass Yang Ming's learning of a generation, (The teacher's "New Explanation of the Great Learning" sought to criticize Zhu Zi by examining bamboo like Yang Ming. In fact, without sincerely seeking knowledge, one cannot investigate the principles of things.) Faintly like Bai Juyi writing poetry in his later years. Knowing the "Book of Changes," one should know there is no regret. Passing on the torch, his children and grandchildren have virtuous heirs. Wearing white mourning clothes like snow, expressing heartfelt grief. Shedding tears, three thousand disciples walk in mourning. Upright qi exists between heaven and earth. The landscape will sense the vicissitudes of life from now on. A master of the literary world, respecting the teacher's model. A national defense, his industrial achievements have fallen. It is difficult to recall the events of the past with wine and music. The spring lanterns and literary games at the high hall. Not lamenting the unicorn's misfortune or resenting the poverty of the Way. Compiling annals is even better than Du Fu. Creating deep and great achievements that are also reorganizing. After the cataclysm, the family garden is half-abandoned. Few people in this chaotic world are like Tao Yuanming. His unwavering heart can be compared to Zhuang Zhou throughout the ages. The dragon has left the tripod, leaving the bow behind. Sorrowfully remembering the rain of enlightenment in those years. Twenty years of deleted drafts, treasures in the box. Personally bearing the scarlet curtain, bestowed with fine wine. Asking about characters, he strictly taught the details of prosody. Discussing poetry, he especially permitted the truth of the soul. Having experienced separation and chaos, compiling new grass, (The teacher recently compiled "Grass Amidst Separation and Chaos" for publication.) Awakening to emptiness, opening up the dust of the cataclysm. (The teacher foretold his departure from the world at 10:00 AM to his family in the morning of his passing.) Leaving behind a ten-thousand-mile pen south of the sky. Rarely recording sorrow and hardship with a broad mind.</p>

<h3>Economic Menu for a Week</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Don't say that the prices of meat dishes like chicken, duck, and fish have skyrocketed: even the vegetables these days are exceptionally expensive, truly leading to a trend where people only eat white rice without vegetables. Look at the most ordinary water spinach, costing as much as 30 cents per pound, amaranth has been on the market for a long time, and it still costs 20 cents per pound, broad beans, although only cost 8 cents per pound, are in pods, taking up half the weight, and cannot be considered cheap. The relatively cheap option is cabbage at 12 cents per pound. My family originally loves to eat cabbage, so we eat cabbage three or four days a week. For meat dishes, stir-fry with sliced or diced pork, sometimes chopping the pork and using large cabbage leaves to wrap it like a quilt to eat. For vegetarian dishes, either stir-fry alone or add bamboo shoots, shiitake mushrooms, wheat gluten, sweet potatoes, etc., to make vegetarian "Ten Delights." In short, living is difficult these days, so we can only choose relatively cheap things to eat.</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>Cabbage with Sliced Pork, Sweet and Sour Mandarin Fish, Diced Broad Beans, Tofu with Chinese Toon</p>
<p>Tuesday</p>
<p>Celery Beef, Yellow Croaker with Vegetables, Pan-fried Tofu with Vegetables, Stir-fried Water Spinach</p>
<p>Wednesday</p>
<p>Stir-fried Shredded Pork, Clear Stewed Carp Soup, Braised Vegetarian Ten Delights, Stinky Tofu</p>

<p>Tomato Beef Soup, Braised Small Carp, Yellow Bean Sprouts with Cabbage, Stir-fried Cellophane Noodles with Vegetables</p>
<p>Friday</p>
<p>Cabbage Wrapped Pork, Sweet and Sour Fried Hairtail, Celery and Bean Sprouts, Stir-fried Wheat Gluten with Seaweed</p>

<h3>The Plague of Bedbugs</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Bedbugs suck human blood and disturb peace, causing sleepless nights, leading to mental exhaustion, affecting health and daytime work. This is a major threat to the lives of the general public—especially the working masses—during the summer. Methods to eliminate bedbugs, such as pyrethrum powder, injecting kerosene or gasoline or stinky liquid, or injecting other water-like insecticidal liquids, are only effective in treating the symptoms. The effective range is limited to the moment when the bedbug touches the powder or liquid. The ideal method of eradicating bedbugs should focus on complete extermination. Recently, the "Climb Not Bedbug Self-Extermination Powder," which is popular on the market, only requires a small amount of powder to be poured into a paper bag and placed on the four corners of the bed before going to bed, which can attract bedbugs and cause them to die on their own, just like a bug-catching lamp that attracts moths to the fire, causing the bugs to come on their own and die on their own. It saves time and labor. Moreover, "Climb Not Bedbug Powder" can be used continuously, gradually reducing bedbugs and eventually achieving the effect of complete eradication. It is truly a pesticide with perfect efficacy.</p>

<h3>Before Summer Vacation: Difficulty in Further Education, Greater Difficulty in Employment, Difficulty in Studying, Even Greater Difficulty in Graduating</h3>
<p>— Ren Ming</p>
<p>It is not easy to be a middle school student for six years. Parents have put in a lot of effort, paying tuition for twelve semesters, and one has also studied diligently under the window for six years, enduring all kinds of hardships, and finally made it to graduation.</p>
<p>Graduation, in this day and age, is not something to be optimistic about. The future prospects are very uncertain, further education is difficult, and employment is even more difficult. However, these are problems after graduation. Who knew that the exams have not yet been held, and seeing the notices from the academic affairs office and the student union these days, I realized that there is still a hurdle to overcome before graduating, which is a large sum of money.</p>
<p>At a time when the cost of living is rising daily, the cost of books and stationery is already difficult to bear. Now, at the time of graduation, it is even more impossible to raise this sum of money temporarily, and the use of this money does not have much value. However, because it is stipulated by the school authorities and the student union, although one does not agree, one cannot violate the whole, so it has become an indispensable expense!</p>
<p>The estimated amount is at least forty dollars, and the items for payment are as follows:</p>
<p>Regulations from the school side: (1) Pay a graduation certificate fee of five yuan; (2) Four semi-body photos (need to take half a dozen two-inch photos)</p>
<p>Regulations from the student union side: (1) Eight yuan for a farewell dinner; (2) Five yuan for the graduation yearbook (this is a beautifully printed booklet, the content of which, in addition to inscriptions from teachers, is to select a better article from each person's composition book for publication. Now that printing costs have risen, five dollars is not enough, and I am afraid we will have to pay another one or two yuan); (3) Two yuan for group photos; (4) Three yuan for the graduation souvenir ring; (5) Three cents for the directory of all teachers and students (originally intended to be attached to the yearbook, but because it took up too much space, fearing that it would increase paper and printing costs, it was changed to a mimeographed booklet); (6) Graduating students should jointly send a souvenir to the alma mater as a permanent memento (no purchase has been made yet, but five yuan has been collected temporarily)</p>
<p>In private, some students are exchanging photos and giving souvenirs, which, of course, I am also a part of, and it is difficult to refuse. In addition, there are students going to the interior, and everyone has to send them off.</p>
<p>Some people think that this expense is nothing, and besides, graduation is a major event, rarely encountered in a lifetime, and it is worth spending a few dollars to commemorate it. However, for students from poorer families, the expenses for each semester are budgeted and cannot be overspent. This expense is unexpected, and of course it is difficult to take out the money.</p>
<p>Everyone laments that education is built on money. To enter the gates of school, one must have money, but even when graduating, to get a diploma and leave school, one still needs money. "Studying is difficult," but who would have thought that "graduation is difficult too!"</p>
<h3>Graduation Fees</h3>
<p>— Mao Chun</p>
<p>I have a younger brother who is studying at a certain primary school in Wangjiesha Garden on Carter Road in this city. This semester is his sixth grade, and he will graduate before this summer vacation.</p>
<p>Today he ran home and asked his father for seven dollars, and his father asked him what it was for. He said it was a "graduation fee."</p>
<p>His father had rarely heard of "graduation" requiring a "fee" and thought his younger brother was lying, so he borrowed a telephone and called the school to inquire. The principal in the school personally listened to the phone and told his father very frankly that it was true, and the reason was very simple: "Paper prices are soaring, there are many graduating students, and the school cannot afford the graduation certificates. Therefore, to graduate, one must pay a graduation fee."</p>
<p>After his father returned home, he was very angry, but finally opened the trunk and reluctantly took out seven dollars to give to his younger brother. But I am very skeptical, does a graduation diploma really require seven dollars? Have paper prices really risen to this point?</p>
<p>To be honest, the school must also know this. They are taking advantage of the difficulty of graduating to try to rip off the students, so they are even demanding an amount that is almost the same as tuition. I think there must be many schools in Shanghai that "set up various pretexts" to collect fees. I hope that people with a sense of justice in society will come out and punish them together!</p>
<h3>The Way to Hygiene</h3>
<p>— A Certain Person</p>
<p>Summer has just begun, and people living in pigeon lofts are already feeling the heat. In a few more weeks, they will naturally have to copy old articles, carry broken mats, and sleep on the streets again. Seeing the air-conditioning equipment in tall buildings, with fans running non-stop, is of course endlessly enviable. Even passing by the door of an ice cream shop, one can't help but salivate.</p>
<p>But being envious is useless. It is still important to pay attention to one's own hygiene within the possible range. The lives of the poor are not worth much, but excessive enjoyment is not necessarily happiness.</p>
<p>Air-conditioning equipment and fans running non-stop are indeed comfortable to live in, but the outdoor climate cannot be changed. This disparity between cold and heat often makes it easy to encounter the invasion of terrible diseases when going in and out. At the same time, according to doctors, it is necessary to sweat in the summer, otherwise the body will not be smooth, and cold drinks stimulate the stomach, which is also harmful and unprofitable. This is not Ah Q's "You are my son," just as we have a healthy body, why envy those expensive tonics.</p>
<p>The most important condition in summer is to pay attention to diet. The "Do not eat unclean things, do not drink unboiled water" that is often seen on electric poles truly encompasses the way to hygiene in the summer.</p>
<p>Don't be envious of the rich's enjoyment, just pay attention to your own health. If you unfortunately get sick, the lives of the poor are not worth much.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianqing</p>
<p>Chapter 24: Lakes and Mountains Each Have Their Own Charms, Scholars and Ladies Joyfully Call Out "Long Live" Together</p>
<p>On this day, Jin Danyang and Mrs. Su Liya discussed opening two family touring cars to go to Freedom Village. The reason was that many people from Shanghai wanted to visit Freedom Village. One part was Lin Jiancheng, Jin Danyang's friend, and even the architect who built the factory building for the He family's two young ladies was also included. One part was Mrs. Su Liya's friends, and there were also several, all of whom had lived in China for a long time and had a close friendship with the Chinese. Originally, because of the rain, many people were hesitant, but now that they saw that the atmosphere was clear, everyone wanted to go. There was also Mr. Jiang Jingrong, who, for the He family's young ladies' silk factory, had the groundbreaking ceremony on that day, and the two young ladies insisted on inviting Elder Jiang to the scene, so he also hitched a ride in the family touring car. This car went straight to Freedom Village, without stopping along the way. As for Wu Junsu and her party, they went directly from Suzhou. Lao Zhang the doctor and his party went directly from Anle Town, which was very convenient. Zhu Airen had arrived at Freedom Village the day before, helping her grandfather and mother manage everything. Fortunately, there were many people in the countryside who could handle things, and it was easy with everyone's help, so Village Chief Zhu did not have to work very hard. There was also one more thing, the He family's young ladies had written a letter to Zhu Airen two days earlier. That was to have them take care of the lunch on that day, because that day was the groundbreaking ceremony for their silk factory, and they should treat their guests. However, the place had to borrow the village hall. Their factory, as well as their residence, were being built in Freedom Village, and they were now all members of the village. However, on that day, because there were foreign guests in attendance, the dishes seemed to have to be better prepared, and I was afraid that no one in Freedom Village could handle such a large banquet. But Zhu Airen said: There is no need to worry about this, Freedom Village is not far from Suzhou, and when the time comes, hire a kitchen to handle it here. But you have to prepare how many guests, so that they can prepare. The He family's young ladies said that 300 guests would be enough, right? They were preparing to feast the guests and the people of Freedom Village on this day. Zhu Airen said: No matter what, we won't need 300 guests, half that number, 150 guests should be enough. Zhu Airen was always planning to be thrifty and did not want to waste a single bit. She hired a kitchen in advance to handle it properly. The place for the banquet was also discussed and arranged with her grandfather. When tomorrow came, many people had already gotten up at the break of dawn. The first major thing to do was to see what the weather was like today. At first, it still felt a bit hazy with morning mist, but gradually a round red sun broke through the clouds, and the overnight mist was completely cleared, illuminating the earth. At that time, there was a burst of cheers, and everyone said: "Today is a good day! Not only is everyone's spirits lifted, but even all the flowers and trees have been revitalized. (287)</p>
<h3>Pen, Ink, Paper</h3>
<p>— Qiang Gong</p>
<p>I wrote this topic, meaning that I want to advocate for domestic products in front of people who use pen, ink, and paper. The consumption of these things nationwide—especially in Shanghai—is truly considerable.</p>
<p>Most of the pens, ink, and paper used daily are foreign goods. Nowadays, prices are expensive for everything, and of course pens, ink, and paper cannot be exceptions. Therefore, switching to Chinese pens, ink, and paper, even if the price cannot be much cheaper, at least the rights and interests will not flow out.</p>
<p>Now schools and businesses almost all use fountain pens, foreign ink, and foreign paper. If they can switch to using brushes and Chinese paper, then it will also be a small supplement to the increase in national power.</p>
<p>Our country has always used brushes to write formal documents, and the documents used by government agencies are also written with brushes on Chinese paper. However, at present, elementary, middle, and universities use fountain pens to write on foreign paper for their homework. Therefore, once out of school, they simply cannot hold a brush to write documents, which seems a bit contradictory.</p>
<p>Writing the same text, expressing the same meaning, why not use a brush but a fountain pen? This is probably due to the trend. A fountain pen represents being well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning. Even if you cannot be well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning, you must be able to hang it on your clothes to show "登樣一." In terms of appearance, fountain pens are certainly more "fashionable," but in terms of practical application or when you leave school in the future, brushes will be difficult for you everywhere. I hope that the current students in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools can also pay a little attention to brushes, Chinese paper, ink, and other items.</p>
<p>This article does not have any exaggerated praise for Chinese pens, ink, and paper. However, in fact, brushes and other items are still everywhere in Chinese society. Because modern young students have too neglected these things, which they will still have to use in the future and regard as good friends, I have made some casual comments about them.</p>
<h3>Take It or Leave It</h3>
<p>— Locke</p>
<p>Ten years ago, according to a bookstore owner, booksellers should aim for middle school students; because elementary school students do not yet know the importance of reading, university students love to go to dance halls to play and do not want to read, only middle school students are really reading.</p>
<p>Now, according to an educator, university students go to dance halls, and many middle school students are also going to dance halls. There are also a large number of people in movie theaters, and even more are taking advantage of the fact that most of the schools on the current isolated island do not have physical education and are going to ice skating rinks. They, like university students, do not want to read, only elementary school students are really reading.</p>
<h3>From Fear to Courage</h3>
<p>What we need today is courage, and what our daily life demands is also courage. A person born in this era, if without the mental and spiritual power, can never cope with the difficulties of life. Perhaps you have talent and learning, but without courage, your achievements will be very limited. If you cannot discover the source of courage in your own life, you will feel that your thoughts and talents are useless. How many people today, in disappointment and despair, say to themselves, "It's useless, useless, this kind of battle is not worth fighting for us, public opinion is too opposed to us, we lack the main force required by life." Behind this attitude are countless kinds of fears. From our childhood, these kinds of fears have only increased and expanded. When we were children, we were afraid of the dark, afraid of strong classmates bigger than us, afraid of failing homework and exams. A little older, the fear is even greater. Some people fear that their social status and economy will be in danger. Some fathers fear that they will not be able to maintain the lives of their families. Some young men and women want to get married, but they don't know how to manage economically. We are surrounded by all kinds of fears. Material fears, such as having no money to spend, fearing unemployment, etc. In short, in daily life, no one does not experience fear, and what is the result? Mental decay, feeling full of pain, panic, and failure. Our fears hinder our progress and block our talents. In despair, we shout loudly, "Who can save us from this body of death?" What people need is to get rid of fear and overcome all the boredom that corrupts personality. There is a great prophet in the Bible who teaches us courage. His words were originally spoken to the exiled Hebrews, who were cruelly exiled from their homeland by other nations to foreign countries with different cultures and religions to be prisoners, serving their masters. They were originally a nation of great courage, who had discovered the secret of faith that gave them strength, comfort, and power. (To be continued) For detailed study, please write to P.O.
