<p>社評</p>
<h3>美加聯防</h3>
<p>美國總統羅斯福氏於十七晚，在俄格登斯堡，與加拿大首相金氏會談的結果,於十八日發表共同文告，略謂「雙方業已議定，加拿大與美國應立即組織關於國防之永遠聯合委員會，俾即日着手研究海陸空問題，而以廣大觀念，考慮西半球北半部之防務；此會由雙方各派代表四五人組織之，此項代表大都由海陸空軍中選任」云。加拿大是大不列顚帝國的一部分，去年九月，即已追隨英國，對德國宣戰，現在正在歐洲方面繼續作戰之中；遠征軍早已陸續出發，關於空軍人員以及物資方面尤竭力供應。在這時候，更與美國成立防守同盟性質的協定，當然是極耐體味而極堪注意的事件。美加聯防的範圍與具體辦法，或者尙未秘密確定；總之，未經透露，無從懸測。所可信的，美加相處的態度，必能披肝瀝膽而彼此誠信相孚；在性質上，在精神上、美國決非侵略，決非趁火打刦，必完全尊重加拿大的主權與國家的原來地位；而加拿大決非背棄了大不列顚，自甘委屈而爲美國的附庸。其間有待方來的事實爲說明者：加拿大一面矢忠誠於大不列顚而竭全力作戰，一面又將怎樣忠誠於美加聯防協定而竭全力與美國分担西半球北部的海陸空防務重任？關於這一點，美加雙方必有深切諒解，自不容疑；但實際分寸究竟如何，殆爲舉世所欲先知爲快吧！</p>
<p>美國左臨大西洋，右控太平洋；大西洋方面使美國應付複雜的原因，在乎歐洲局勢的複雜，在在影饗及於美國的將來；太平洋方面使美國應付複雜的原因，在乎所屬夏威夷間島菲列賓的迢遠伸人遠東，關係複雜，在在牽涉美國當前的利害。如此兩面應付，使美國更感覺亟於團結美洲的必要。故分析美國的國際政策，東對歐洲，南對中美南美各國，西對遠東，北對加拿大，因對象的逈然不同，所追求的目的亦絕相懸殊；綜觀其東南西北，纔見得美國的整個國策。當前的國際全盤情况，陷美國於必須多方斟酌的環境之中。較之世界其他各國，即使各國各有其空前的艱鉅危險，却亦各有所專；如中國惟對日抗戰以求最後勝利，日本惟求完成對華侵略，英國亟於對德，德義亟於對英；蘇聯猶得靜以待動，惟美國則不容束手而不能不有所作爲，但千端萬緒。蘇聯至少在目前業已保持着主動的萬分自由，而美國的主動地位還待挣扎，始策萬全；不但如此，中國的被侵略，法國的被征服，英國的孤軍苦鬥，無一不是美國的殷鑒，亦無一不是美國所感覺的威脅。總統羅斯福氏以次的遠見卓識之士，所殫思竭盧者，即在如何遂行其國策，如何對於其本國，與對美洲，以及對歐局對遠東，克副美國所擺脫不了的各種責任與道義。但是陸續已有其偉大的成就了。七月上旬的泛美會議，對於中美南美各國、形成進一步的團結；現在父對於加拿大，確定聯防；凡此竟義，在政治上經濟上軍事上當然有無上的價値，而其根本的主　意義，還在美國精神的透達全美洲、締造了和好無間，通力合作的基礎。</p>
<p>美國不能團結美洲，是美國致命的失敗；使美國對於美洲以外的國際，缺乏　健的憑藉；至於今後，美國必然一面在美洲完成其技術的建設，一面在國際顯示其政策的活躍。</p>
<h3>美國與加拿大　訂聯合防禦同盟　組織永久聯合委員會　考慮西半球北部防務</h3>
<p>俄格頓斯堡　美總統羅斯福與加拿大首相金氏昨在羅斯福總統專車上舉行重要會議時、雙方同意設立加拿大、美國永久聯合委員會、計劃西半球防務、該會並將聯合硏究「關於海·陸·空問題、包括人事及原料等等」、會後雙方發表文吿聲稱、「永久聯合防務委員會、將由兩國各派四五人組織之、大多數爲現役軍人、該會卽將召集」、羅斯福總統與金氏會談、自星期六下午六時十五分起、至昨晨一時止、文吿未嘗提及加拿大以自治領資格、參加歐戰、但該項協定重申羅斯福總統在加拿大翁泰利俄向金氏所發之保證、謂倘加拿大受北美洲國家威脅時、美國不能袖手旁觀、加·美協定之後、英·美兩國將接洽美國購買或租賃西半球英國島嶼之海空根據地、（十九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>俄格頓斯堡　羅斯福總統與加拿大首相金氏、昨日聯合發表一文謂、已議定加拿大與美國應立卽組織關於國防之永遠聯合委員會、俾卽日着手硏究海·陸·空問題、而以廣大觀念、考慮西半球北半部之防務、雙方各派代表四五人組成此會、此項代表大都由海·陸·空軍中選出云、羅總統於此文吿發表後、卽起程赴其海德公園之消夏別墅、（十九日路透社電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　共和黨參議員樊登堡、評述美國與加拿大設立永久聯合防務委員會之提議云、加拿大之保衛、乃美國最後無可避免之責任云、按昨日蒞會表示意見之參·衆兩院外交委員、對於羅斯福總統與加拿大首相金氏所發成立聯合防務委員會之宣言、均表贊成、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>渥太華　此間行政界對美總統羅斯福與加拿大總理金氏、成立創設美加永久聯防機關之協定、均認爲非常重要、據美官方意見、此事之進展、將增大加拿大爲一北美國之地位、美人士均信、此協定將使加拿大完全加入門羅主義之維持、又稱、此項諒解、足爲美英間關於西半球防禦問題合作之媒介、此間政界相信、內閣總理金氏已被授權代表英帝國參與西半球之防禦、若千具體建議、當望成立云、（十九日合衆社電）</p>
<p>渥太華　前任美國威爾遜總統內閣陸軍次長之白萊根利芝上校、頃應加拿大情報部長之請、向加拿大全國播音、略謂、「余對本國所希望者、厥爲美國拔刀爲自由與人道而戰、余茲向絕無疑懼之加拿大致敬、西半球各國爲本身利益計、並就智勇兩者言、均應步加拿大之後塵、而予英國以無吝色之援助、苟美洲昏睡不醒、而英國衰落、則美洲醒覺時悔之晚矣、世界不能在半奴隸與半自由之狀態中苟延殘喘、希特勒熟知此點、故驅其以蹂躪他人爲能事之民族、摧毀自由的最後堡壘云、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>紐約　頃接巴拿馬運河地帶電訊稱、美國將在嘎拉怕戈斯羣島建設海軍根據地、以防衛西半球爲目的、上述羣島屬赤道國管轄、美國與赤道國組織聯合委員會、以赤道國參謀部長烏魯西亞將軍爲主席、該委員會人員於數日前乘美國巡洋艦愛利號、前往視察擬闢爲軍港之地點、今晨美國驅逐艦塔特拿號、護送愛利號抵此、（十九日海通社電）</p>

<p>日來新秋酷熱，天氣失常，各種時症，最易流行。秋老虎又在張牙舞爪，肆虐人間矣。近據工部局衛生處統計：前週死亡人數共八八四人，突破年來死亡最高紀錄，其中以痢疾傷寒痧症流行最烈。又據本市消息，霍亂漸有流行趨勢，死亡率約百分之十五云云。足見情形相當嚴重。市民怵於虎患，紛紛購用各種有効預防藥物，以備萬一。其中尤以購用李衆勝堂保濟丸為最多。緣以此種保濟丸乃中外著名之老牌良藥，最具有治病防病能力，對於吐·瀉·肚痛·時疫·霍亂·各種痢疾，及其他陽胃各病等，均奏實効。且藥性純和，服用簡便。故各界多樂於購備保濟丸，僉認為預防秋老虎之最有効方法云。</p>
<h3>外輪復航滬閩綫　最近絕無希望　謀福輪再駛古鰲頭已作罷論　噸位較輕船隻尚擬再度試航</h3>
<p>浙閩海口、日軍宣布封鎖後、浙省有松門·古鰲頭·福建有三江口、不在封鎖之例、故海關照常結關放行、惟駛往上述三處之航輪、均遭檢查、並勒令開回、致前駛往三江口之神佑·神華·新安納·永豐·等各輪、均未達目的地、而被迫駛回、神華輪復遇盜騎刦、損失浩大、駛往古鰲頭之哈納·謀福·永泰·等輪、亦遭阻撓、亦已開回上海、又傳謀福輪再擬駛往試探一節、聞該公司已作罷、所裝貨物卽往起卸上棧、</p>
<p>常德返滬</p>
<p>常德輪於本月七日、自滬儎貨駛往古鰲頭、中途屢遭日艦搜查、並誤入日海軍警戒綫、一度被扣留、船主極力向日海軍說明後、得獲釋放、經過許多波折、始於十日晨開鰲江、卸貨竟達一星期之久、因日機連日轟炸、沿江碼頭略損、工人大多逃避、白畫無事可做、傍晚略予工作、故去貨得能卸清、已屬大幸、來貨裝儎更覺困難、祇得放空返滬、昨午到埠、在五馬路外灘三號碼頭略事停靠、卽開往黃浦董家渡對岸停泊、英商永華輪日前駛往古鰲頭、雖得進口、惟因工人逃避一空、無法卸貨、故祇得退回上海、昨已到埠、現正將貨卸出上棧、俟貨物卸空、亦卽駛入南市浦面停泊、對於復航、恐最近希望毫無、</p>
<p>試航松門</p>
<p>德商魯麟洋行高登輪雖擬復航松門·南田·金清港·　溪·能否實行、尚難確定、昨日傍晚、有懸掛憲國旗二小輪、均不滿五十噸、出口駛往松門、該二小輪又無無綫電之設備、故在海面情形將無從得悉、須抵目的地後、始有報告、</p>

<p>日輪失事</p>

<h3>夫婦知識</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念曾合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川中口中國信托公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>夫婦間受情久暫的研究</p>
<p>這個問題太嚴重了，有著很多的夫婦、他們也是戀愛結婚的，在新婚的時候、是何等的恩愛、可是曾幾何時？他們就鬧翻了　不是男子在外另行金屋藏嬌，就是女的暗結張望歡或竟與夫訴請離婚之訟。俗諺說得好：「新作夫妻三年香，過了三年臭坑缸」。把男女間喜新厭舊的心理、真是形容得淋漓盡緻。</p>
<p>我們再在另一方觀察，衣服是愈新愈好，人是愈舊愈好。少年夫婦來來伴，白首偕老的畫眉夫妻在世間也真多著，不是常有於婚後數十年的老年夫婦、還舉行著什麼銀婚金婚嗎？這是，家庭和樂，兒孫滿堂，親朋滿座，額手稱觴，是何等的愉快而幸福！多福多壽多男子，是中國社會一向所稱頌的。那末，夫婦間的愛情為什麼不天長地久而欲短暫於一時呢？</p>
<p>揭開天窗說亮話、夫婦是男女兩性的結合、他們的愛情，是完全建築在「靈肉一致」的基礎之上，夫婦於婚後、如果大家能注意於性的衛生，保持著性機能的永久健康。那他們如果因戀愛而結婚者，必然愛情能地久天長、遠無止境、如果是媒約妁之言的婚姻、他們的愛情更會長增高、熱烈的恩愛更在於婚後的將來。總之，一對男健女美的夫婦、大家能永保性能健康、更能運用著智慧、隨時製造著他們愛情的話，若無特殊環境的引誘、他們愛情必不會中途變節的。要是男子如果於早年犯有自瀆與遺精、或婚後的荒淫縱欲與憂勞新傷之故、爆發著滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，神經衰弱，粗薄不育，發育不全，精力渙散等症，在這樣的情形之下，無論他們意志是如何的相投、生活和環境是如何的舒適、偏在精神一方面的愛是斷不能維持長久的。必然愛情日漸淡薄、終至於同床異夢，演出家庭間之種種悲劇！聰明丈夫欲謀恢復愛情，好夢重圓，唯一辦法，即在根本治愈其疾病。治療之法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服生殖腺素制劑「生殖素」，最為對症而特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間卽能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，必要於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，並可收延年益壽，返老還童之效。惟一遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止潰洩，則收效尤速。但患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電離療·注射·手術等各種對症療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯是女性幸福的源泉</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>願作鴛鴦不羨仙。濃呢蜜愛度華年，倘因疾病雙乳癟，科學彌補英遲延！</p>
<p>在現代潮流中，要做一個摩登女子，而值得被人稱上一聲「美」，非注意身體的健康不可，而尤其非注意乳峯的發育不可！因為現在的男子看女人，他們不看頭足，兩只閃電似的眼睛，祇向你的胸前射來，如果看到你的一對乳峯，在行動時，高高地現著一起一伏，有著十足誇人的驕姿，則面貌就是較次，亦屬滿不在乎。反之，如果你的乳峯像出了氣的皮球，松馳萎癟，那麼即使你的面孔長得真似林黛玉，趙飛燕，也不能博得他們的好感，甚至冷言譏諷！至於自認聰明的女子，不惜魚目混珠，戴上乳罩，可是當春閨喜劇序幕揭開的時候，依然白費心機一場空，原形畢露，結果，自己羞愧，男子厭惡！感情破裂，悲劇產生！</p>
<p>然則女子的乳峯何以會萎癟的呢？此據世界婦科名醫Kandeaning及余等經驗，均認為由於自瀆，束胸，月經不調，白帶，以及產後虛弱，而致卵巢機能遭受摧殘所致，唯一補救辦法，祇有積極服以卵巢劑女用，「生殖素」，最為對症而特效，蓋此劑配制精良，服後一日夜間卽可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經。暖宮止帶，如繼續服用，不但可使萎癟的乳峯變得高聳，同時還能使追記憔悴的面孔，變成豐腴紅潤，從肌肉裏透出鮮　的光彩，嫵媚動人。</p>
<h3>遺精與腦弱失眠的關係</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>在這煩囂的都市，日長夜短的夏天，如果患者夜不成寢的失收眠症，這是最痛苦的。因為終日工作已十分辛勞，在血液內充滿著疲勞的毒素，晚間又轉輾反側的不能熟睡，聽著時鐘一秒一分的過去，然天將發曉重行駕在勞動的事務上了，這是何等的淒慘！他的健康必然一天天的低落，而終至於不可救藥！</p>
<p>考失眠症的原因，雖有多端，青年人初入春情發動時期，因無知與好奇，每有自瀆惡癖，自瀆稍久，因神經受其摧殘，常致減弱或竟失卻效用。因此，精關開闔遂無法控制，就繼起遺精症。遺精一起，如遷延不治，腦，脊髓，性三大神經更受嚴重的打擊，是以凡腦衰健忘，失眠多夢，畏煩思慮，志氣消沉，腰　背痛，腎虧無能，精力渙散，發育不全等症相繼而來，此種男子，終日神思恍惚，如睡非睡，如醉非醉，不特在職業與學術上毫無成就，即在夫婦生活上亦必不能美滿，為妻憎恨！甚或未老先衰，早年殤亡，枉此一生！唯一補救辦法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，鎮靜神經，不特可得安眠，更可根治遺精。如因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，並可收延年益壽返老還童之效。</p>
<h3>鐵一般的事實</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾錄</p>
<p>（一）遺精青年莫因循自誤</p>
<p>喬榮祖君，年三十歲，寧波人，為家鄉常遭轟炸，客歲來滬，寄宿於本埠某中學疑業。但滬地環境過於淫靡，校中又無良好之訓育設施，寄宿學生常可以出外閑遊，曾有一次為妓拉去，因時興淫念，或犯自瀆，詎知自瀆一犯，極易成癖，致精關松弛，爆發遺精症，初時每月不過二三次，繼漸增至五六次十數次，於是面黃肌瘦，記憶不良，腦昏頭痛，耳鳴耳花，四肢疲備，腰酸背痛等症象叢生，校中功課因此亦一落千丈，春假前考試未能及格，喬君至此，乃覺悟自瀆遺精之為害，然屢服市上成藥，均鮮效果，上月初始來本診所診治，欲決心治癒其症症，由專家醫師詳細診察其病狀後，知確係由遺精失治之故，即囑其赴中西大藥房購治遺特效藥「　米脫氏固精片」兩匣，及生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」兩打，使之兼服，並間　施用「迭門氏」電療術，經三星期之悉心治療，頃已精神振足，頭腦清明，上述症象已完全　然矣。</p>
<p>（二）結婚後丈夫的悲哀</p>
<p>高明君，年廿六，於去年冬間結婚，夫婦間從未能融洽，因高君於婚後發現陽痿症，且略有遺精，夫婦感情惡劣異常，然高君內心中之痛苦雙豈能以言語形容，雖曾服用市上所謂「補腎生精內分泌劑」甚少效果，心益奧喪！上月因其友介紹（其友顧君亦曾在本診所治愈其暗疾者）親至本診所診治，經察知其狀後，卽囑其購生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」三打，「希米脫氏固精片」一盒，使之兼服，並每日施用電療注射等新醫術，一月於茲，頃已精強力壯，夫婦愛情不朦繾綣雲。</p>

<h3>多頭興趣漢衰　現金重漲　匯票漸緊實為主因</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、疲中帶堅、乃買進者多頭信心不變、加碼吸收尚勇、兼外匯復轉緊勢、價更易拉起、晨初最低僅五千六百二十元、經銀號金號乘機猛購後、升達五千六百九十元、中錢兌業供塞佔多、後證券幫及某金號賣出、略挫三四十元、惟終聞匯市呈軟、散戶俱進、再漲至五千六百八十元、午收則為五千六百七十六元、後市買氣愈盛、乃利多流言又至、傳日軍海防登陸、激動而漲、金號等力扒由開盤五千六百八十元、抬至七百〇五元、後雖小跌、但最高竟晉達五千七百五十元、乃證券幫大買之故、晚收亦有五千七百三十元、較上星期六收軋升七十元之巨、全日成交尚旺、約　千余兩、銀樓飾金終則掛高十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲七十元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十輛）、初以人心疲軟、賣者頗多、致開市撳小四十元、錢兌業出銀號三十兩、為五千六百二十元、嗣某銀號一再狂吸、而斯時金號幫吃胃亦健、雖錢兌業居間塞出、但終寡不敵眾、未幾卽升達五千六百九十元、旋乃金號幫及散多復吐、加之證券幫亦有賣出、一度曾又挫至五千六百五十五、此後錢兌業忽來補空、月人心仍堅、脫手者復來拖入、故　盤前再升至五千六百八十元、　收市則告五千六百七十六元、午後市氣更佳、開市卽高四元、銀號互做上兩、為五千六百八十元、嗣經銀樓業及銀號等競入、不久即出五千七百元關口、銀號進金號十兩、升為五千七百〇五元、後乃證券幫與銀號多頭吐出、回低至五千六百九十三元、不意斯時本埠防軍會議有重開之說、一時買風復起、金號及銀號等首來拖進、立升至五千七百二十元、此後更以再有海防吃緊之消息、買風愈濃、三時許竟見五千七百五十元高價、而後則因獲利浮多出龍、回跌二十元、金號出銀號二十兩、退為五千七百三十九元、結果比上週未軋漲七十元、（收後場外初曾做過五千七百二十元、但最後五千七百三十元、尚難習進）、全天一百三十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十數元、收進　低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮做　、</p>

<p>「附注」上海近來因流資充塞、市面平穩、交易日減、使七月份之交換及代改金額與票據均較六月份減少、而交換及同業存款則較六月份增加達二千八百八十四萬五千一百二十七元七角四分、開銀行準備會存款之新紀錄、</p>
<h3>外幣轉漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市況、烚赤跌後突漲、午後漲勢尤勁、故英美金鎊一跌卽漲、終告上漲二元、英金票需要不惡、市價回漲二角、美金票雖曾退至十七元五角一分、但旋卽步漲、午後更有種種利多傳說、故漲風益熾、晚市高至十七元五角二角、比上週亦軋升　角七分、香港票稍有需要、市價略漲、日金票及朝鮮票堅挺非凡、各方需要奇殷、市價奔勝殊烈、前者高至一元三角九分、後者高至一　零五分、</p>
<h3>敬告惠稿諸君</h3>
<p>邇來時荷各方惠稿，長篇巨著、非本刊篇幅所能容、亦非本刊性質所宜有、棄之有負作者盛意，故請開示地址、附帶郵花，以便退奉。</p>
<p>讀商業新聞縱有興趣，終覺沉悶，蓋大旨不外松緊軟硬，漲跌上下，質言之，非漲即跌，非跌即平，編者常思調劑讀者精神，故屏高談闊論之作於不用，凡有市場情況，生意內容，經濟掌故，工商珍聞，事不論大小，材不拘今古，體不論莊諧，文務求簡練，甚所歡迎，絕表同情，一經刊載，從優致酬。有志作者，盡與乎來！</p>
<h3>證券　內債堅穩　外股一度回疲</h3>
<p>證券暗盤昨市略有盤旋、趨勢仍甚堅俏、多空雙方競爭甚烈、但仍為多方佔優勢、如聯和同康及聯益賣出極為踴躍、而多方竟不感壓迫、實以市場流通籌碼自經各幫收雲關住後、市上籌碼益感缺乏、觀於同行中借貨不易之情況、空方實不易抬頭、昨日上午、聯和奮勇賣出、聯益樂茂繼之、市氣似見虛軟、但以同興進胃極濃、　昶搜購戊丙赤甚有力、此又係一批收貨關進者、樹面形勢頓轉堅定、午後聯和忽又補空、　昶多頭加碼、七號及三十八號專收乙種、市況頓又轉優、同康聯益供出仍感不敷、市價乃又上騰、故結果仍漲五分一角至二角半、成交總數約九十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲　六〇·四五　六〇·三〇　六〇·四五　漲〇·〇五</p>
<p>統乙　五三·七〇　五三·三〇　五三·六〇　又〇·二五</p>
<p>統丙　五〇·七〇　五〇·四五　五〇·六五　又〇·一五</p>
<p>統丁　四九·八五　四九·七五　四九·八〇　平</p>
<p>統戊　五〇·二五　五〇·一五　五〇·二五　漲〇·〇五</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華成煙草公司股五十股、價為四十一元半</p>
<p>昨日眾業股市堅穩非凡、　植企業會德豐等股價俱上漲、下午因謠傳工部局　開　種臨時緊急會議、引起賣北京市拋售、售多方維持亦力、故結果各股價格較最高點僅稍微落、</p>
<h3>紗花　客銷雖零碎如故　棉張江多頭　仍在活動</h3>
<p>紗市始疲繼昂、但趨勢仍在飄忽摩常中、不過現紗銷路、滇港兩幫雖運輸航線中斷、然該幫零星採辦、續而不懈、所以有一份人心、仍傾向在多頭方面、又有一說、申新九廠昔日催促客家出貨、茲有多方將四千包、業已轉寄他棧、棧單仍不吐出、於是大戶空額稍有抵進、市態復活矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、場中人氣不振、多數仍在空方、故二十支雙馬開價跌進九百元關內、為八百九十五元微落至八百九十一元、旋聞雲南香港零碎需要仍不斷、買方又形活動、市價漸漸而上、卒以多方稍有做作、買氣忽濃、四十支雙馬漲至九百五十五元、收盤以後再升八九元、今日有紗一百四十件運煙臺、茲將各幫買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行一、九七〇　江西　二〇</p>
<p>香港　六一〇　內地　四〇</p>
<p>雲南　四四〇　統計三、〇八五</p>
<p>廈門　五</p>
<h3>棉市平凡　實交寂靜</h3>
<p>現棉交易異常寂寞、各方皆在觀望中、加之紗市無大興奮希望、因存紗增厚之故也、而本年國內新棉作有良好消息、所以人心平凡、市面之勁也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市靜寂、因南方幫之套實、及一部份之多頭了結、結果收盤價格較之上日跌落三四磅音、印度市況平平、昨日連同預測無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>滬部外棉交易、昨日又因紗價之穩定、人心因之轉好、棉市交易雖屬清淡、然同業心思破為堅定、蓋因市上目前存底不豐之故也、日商仍稍購放銀期之印棉數百件、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米疲滯</h3>
<p>洋米自週前、度轉疲後、昨則假後初開、仍覺不振、雖早市原根客販力圖扳持、奈內地幫及本鄉店戶等一般實銷依然觀望、市色平庸、及後浮囤散戶等心思交易、亦皆散漫、如中段貨以貨旺銷滯、卽雖立足、漸見下遊三五角、直迨午市、應需者乘廉活動、收盤甚稱定局、迨午後賣氣更旺、且平　米已決定今日開　、本市店化愈形呆滯、市卽不支下降、結果又比上週六小去五六七角不等、回籠原包賣氣亦濃、而實銷與囤戶均乏進意、未致售開、現洋米全日交易亦祇三千多包、</p>
<p>糯米到貨　斷、但以銷場初秋清檔、致市包續軟、價落半元左右、開金溧白元六十元零五角至六十元、常州白元五十八元至五十七元、香港白元五十七元半至五十七元、次米五十四五元、　元五十二元、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、邇來到貨亦稀、前昨朝共僅千餘包、而場外暗盤、傳聞清淡、售價垂軟、開常幫清粳六十五元半至六十六元、無錫粳六十四元半至六十四元、常州蘇崑粳六十三四元、次至六十元左右、宿薄稻六十元、南港原包早稻六十一二元、斛見五十八九元雲、</p>
<p>周浦新粳出新已久、其來源漸旺、不下百餘擔、不過去路零星、更受他貨影響、市面遂起變化、呈疲軟之色、開六十一元至六十元、較週前貶落一元之　、</p>
<p>洋米昨日又有到滬、係怡和洋行之裕生輪、自香港裝來九百九十六包、昨晨抵埠停靠羅斯福碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<h3>日廠粉最活躍</h3>
<p>麵粉自華廠粉供應缺乏、惟日粉馬首是瞻、統市售開錄鳳凰牌近二萬包、上午開盤、因行囤稍有傾吐、價尚平疲、旋以客銷活動、市面轉堅、本月份由十四元六角升至六角半、九月份十四元八角、十月份十四元九角半、內地粉仍為十四元九角半、內地粉仍為十四元五六角、二號粉廠盤亦無出入、聞福新廠雖未開車、尚有少數餘剩貨售出、</p>
<p>小麥昨日尚稱堅稱、查前昨兩天到貨略增、除日商搬運來埠外、華商亦有零星二三千包　法過勁到、所以日廠進胃雖佳、不願一再放盤、聞　市三鑫廠收　　船麥一十一元四五角、華廠吃盤至一十三元、終雖暢辦、</p>
<p>今日有麵粉二萬六千包運往天津、該項麵粉係福新廠之四號粉、今由新祥泰輪運去、（祖）</p>
<h3>雜訉　保管箱召頂　—聞銀行業有取締說—</h3>
<p>最近發現銀行保管箱召頂廣告中、每年租費八元至十二元之保管箱、索頂費一百元至五百元不等、某會職員應永玉君以此事有礙銀行業務、曾向銀行學會、提議、不准保管箱過戶及更換印鑑、並公告各界勿受其愚、該會認為此種建議、銀行與一般租戶均有俾益、故已轉函各行採擇施行、聞各出租保管箱銀行將登報公告、勿受召頂之愚、如欲租保管箱者、盡可先向各銀行登記、以便遇有退租時租用、無需頂費雲、</p>
<h3>疋頭　初冬布疋動銷</h3>
<p>國布　昨日市面平穩、本街及華北粵港各區現銷尚佳、囤戶觀望、略有進出、各市盤站定、浮戶手貨每疋微廉一角至二角半、本街以內地秋銷漸見發展、厚薄　絨·印花絨·藍布·嗶嘰等貨、交易日繁、綜計成交現貨及九月份期貨五百余件、粵港幫辦色布色斜等二百餘件、北路煙津幫辦藍布粗布絨布二百數十件、浙閩幫仍以航運受阻、陷於停頓、</p>
<p>東布　始疲終堅、蓋以本街實銷頗形活動、故晨盤龍頭細布開三十元零四角、同業空頭卽來抵補、午後一度升至三十一元、收盤時為三十元零八角半、中檔彩球陽鶴等牌、每疋亦各提升二角半、細斜存底不多、價尤堅定、四君子嗶嘰每碼漲五厘、後市售開九角零七釐半、</p>
<p>出口　棉布今日有三百八十件、運往煙臺、</p>
<h3>油市　食油再漲元許</h3>
<p>近日油市自動上升以來、又得產價報昂、以致人心活躍、市場中買氣充溢、踢皮球交易又見擴泛、結果比上週末再漲元譜、計成交膠州生油一百件、價為六十五元、又訂九月上半月內交路貨二千件、價亦為六十五元、青島生油一百桶、價為九十三元五角、煙臺生油五百聽、價為九十四元、膠州豆油一百件、價為七十元、煙岐豆油七十件、價為七十元零五角、至七十一元、大運生豆油一百桶、價為九十八元九十九元、及大有餘幫豆油、百擔、價為七十七元、老棧餅為七十六元、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新蜜棗步降</h3>

<h3>五金、竹節鋼條久靜思動</h3>
<p>竹節鋼條岑寂已久、聞最近津幫略見採辦、本街建築幫雖納胃未寬、唯亦已在群起問津、市場氣象、漸有轉機之望、業中人心思隨昂、市盤明平暗緊、昨市喊價三四分雖仍售一千一百五十元、五分至一寸一千一百元、然暗盤已見到相當緊俏、成交因昨適值星期日、故未見有如何廣數、而市場趨勢、已挺秀夥矣、</p>
<h3>統計　七月份　上海工商業異動</h3>
<p>自從五月中旬歐戰局勢發生變化、法國被迫屈服後、繼之紐約市場股票慘落、印美棉下跌、上海市場受此影響、急　發生變化、卽匯市松長、金價狂落、投機份子、均遭來重打擊、予上海畸形繁榮籠罩下黯淡的影子、可是禍不單行、又以世界經濟及政治等等的局勢轉變、如港地加緊防禦工作、積極疏散人口、海防一度封鎖、滇越交通被阻、不久滇緬運輸中斷三月、而浙　沿海口岸、隨著也加緊封鎖、航運中斷、至是上海市場封內地的貿易、在這樣狀況之下、是趨於停頓過程中了、而佛北貿易統制、自六月廿六修正加強之後北方各省的營業、復受阻滯、所謂上海景氣繁榮、是逐漸蝕了、我們祇要看到進出口商營業的蕭條閑散、門市店家的顧客寥寥、便是有力的反映、所以七月份的上海商業、是踏入了由景氣而遞變到不景氣的銜接中、</p>
<p>就七月份上海七商業的異動來說、共計一百六十五家、分析其異動的性質、那末要以推受盤九十三家為首、次為推受股二十九家、創立在籌備及復業各一家、新張之所以不及倒閉家數、也足以證工商業的趨勢是如何呢、這裏更就異動性質來分說一下、</p>
<p>新張　七月份新張十七家、內商號十六家、工廠一家、其比較重要的、有丙康化這製藥廠、中國股票公司、金門大酒店、通惠銀號、正豐銀號、怡紅酒家等、新漲工商的趨勢、可說是仍在畸形發展中、不過值得注意的、是中國股票公司、自外股在五月中旬慘落後、一般驚醒的投機份子、移轉其投機目標、趨向於貨商股票這一方面、果能以遊資而改變為正當投資、是一件很好的現象、中國股票公司、在此風雲際會而成立、許是導入遊資而登投資之途的先聲吧、</p>
<p>創立　七月份經籌備而宣告創立的為大華釘廠一家、</p>
<p>復業　七月份復業的祇賈西義路二百號敖利馬化學品公司</p>
<p>閉歇　七月份清理閉歇的共十二家、就中比較重要的，有益新教育用品製造廠、恒與染坊、華興熱水瓶廠、五福染織廠、振豐銀號等家、紗花業自五月底崩潰後、七月份仍有數家宣告清理、於茲可見此次紗價暴落後所生的後果、真可說是嚴重打擊、（未完）</p>

<h3>齋戒辨（二）</h3>
<p>吳俗尙鬼神，其民間比戶皆有齋戒之單貼於門前，幾於無地無之，或以公醮之故，或以保病之故，視爲正經大事，翕然信之！婦女尤甚。有所謂長齋者，則其誓不開葷者也；有所謂報齋者，率以三年爲期；有所謂雷齋者，觀音齋者，三官齋者，則皆每月數日。値此齋期，雖有戚友喜慶宴會，亦必令廚下素菜以供應之。珍錯在前，絕不下箸，人則嘖啧焉，稱其持齋之心虔，而明理者竊笑之，愚夫愚婦，確然遵信，是固有不可解者矣。昔梁武帝最信佛，三次捨身於同泰寺，羣臣以金錢百萬贖回，通令大下，祭祀以麵跡代犧牲，其所爲如痴如夢，後受困台城，卒之絕食嘔血而死，國亦繼之而亡，是何故也。曾見有吃素幾年後，以「報素一個，某某收用」宇樣，寫於疏中而焚之，不禁爲之捧腹大笑！素屬何物，豈有個數，又安得收而用之耶。若以茹素爲節飮食愼嗜欲之意，藉此以少免殺生，義亦無乖於正道。而蚩蚩者多行不義，欲以此爲消除罪業之計，硜硜謹守，則誤甚矣。</p>

<h3>「向上爬」與「自制力」</h3>
<p>— 丁人</p>
<p>看到本月六日本刊的「自制的力量」以後，覺得有幾點的確是值得商酌的：因爲我們既然能够幸福地生長在目前這種偉大的時代裏，一方面當然要敢於正視現實，而不是逃避現實；另一方面，我們所生長的祖國，是怎樣性質的一個國家，這點，我們千萬含糊不得，否則，恐怕連我們自己的生存，都會感到無所適從的吧！</p>
<p>在中國，這種半殖民地，半封建性質的社會裏，尤其是在目前的過渡時期中一般人往往會找不到自己的生路而感到苦悶；同時，更由於數十年來所經營建設的資本主義社會的影響，和在洋人手下生活已久的習慣，便不能「自制」地想用少數人超過多數人而「鶴立鷄羣」的方法來取得自己的地位，可是這種辦法目前是否行得通呢？這條路走上去有無阻礙呢？倒是值得研討的問題了。</p>
<p>首先，德國的詩人哥德說：「我要做我的主人」，這句話是好的，可是哥德最大的錯誤是犯了「個人主義」的毛病，他沒有看到整個國家，整個民族不能做主人的時候，你「個人」也就只好是做奴隸的，這真理是任何人都不可抹煞，同時也是不能抹煞的。「諸如此類」的現成例子，真是多得很哩，遠的像猶太人，近的像捷克·波蘭……等國有錢有勢的人們，他們怎樣呢？是不是自己是「鶴立鷄羣」「出人頭地」而可以不被驅逐，不被欺侮了呢？事實是最好的說明，柏林的「逐猶政策」是不分有無財勢，有無地位的，它將一體虐待，驅逐，而是無國籍者始終得流浪，顛簸，這就是以「個人」利益爲前提的猶太人民所遭受的苦痛。捷克·波蘭也何嘗不是如此，結果，都是由於少數人的想「保存」「個人利益」，情願爲別人所利用，而結果是變成了人家「國際旅館」裏的「上賓」，這些都是以個人「利益」爲出發，而忘記自己是民族，國家裏的一份子，而得到喪失國籍的報答，那末「前車可鑒」，我們生長在中國的人，是不是應該再從「個人」出發，即使知道牠是壞的，也不妨「克制·忍耐·和平·知足」地來「向上爬」呢？還是走向廣大的人民中間，自己做人民中的一份子，來跟大家學習，獲得真正的提高修養的道路呢？想讀者們自己也會揀定走那一條的。</p>
<p>關於「那些爲人父母的，應該用合理的方法來教導自己的兒女」，這點，就應該是教他們怎樣去學習鬥爭和獲得真理，而不是使他們養成無條件的「忍耐·和平·知足」了。否則中華民族的下一代將更不堪設想！</p>
<p>總之，我也同意運用「自制力，」但它必須是：整個的，國家的，民族的，而不是個人的；同時，它還是「嫉惡如仇」的，「追根究底」的，而不是無條件的隨便「自制」，否則失去了自制的真義。要是「自制」是爲了「有資格去管理命令他人」，這是某些人的本來面目，那是該「又當別論」了！</p>

<h3>偵察機的空中照相</h3>
<p>— 節流</p>
<p>飛機偵察的工作，首先需要精良訓練的飛機師，其次也須頒給飛機師以詳細的命令，命其專事偵察指定的各處地點，庶幾不致茫無頭緒。飛機偵察，如果僅限於少數地點，尚較容易，反之，如果飛行師必須長時期注意整個廣大的地區，那末其工作自必十分困難的了。現代的空軍，爲避免高射槍砲的射擊起見，必須飛得極快，又要飛得很高，同時，敵人地上部隊的僞裝和高射砲等，亦已大見進步，因此，偵察的工作，便更形艱難了。我們不要忘記，當一架雙座機中的偵察員，向地面注視或拍攝照片之時，他隨時都有被敵機襲擊的危險，所以現在偵察機，都逐漸改用三座機了。</p>
<p>不過，空中照相却能補救此項偵察上的困難。它有下列各項主要的優點：</p>
<p>一，凡眼睛不能辨認的細微之點，照片都能够將其攝取，這些細微之點，有時竟連地面上的觀察者，也看不清楚。（因爲角度不同的緣故）。照片最大的優點，就是可以仔細地研究所拍攝的影像，而獲得重要的綫索。將一幀清晰的照片放大以後，就可以準確地發現許多偵察者所看不見的東西。其次如果把許多屬於同一地區，而拍攝時期不同的照片，並列在一起研究，那末既可明瞭敵人的行爲，又能推測其未來的動靜。這是研究敵人火車運輸動態的極妙方法，因爲吾人能在照片上面，準確地計算停留在每一車站中間的車輛數目。又從拍攝普通道路的照片上，亦可發現路上的一切，如車輛，軍隊，甚至單獨的行人，等等。</p>
<p>二，現代的自動照相機，能够把一塊狹長的地區，拍攝在一捲連續的照片之上。這種照相，是由許多照片所合成，每一照片的一半，和其前面一張照片的一半相同，以便研究時互相比較。但是當拍攝是項照片的時候，飛機必須在同一高度飛翔，然後所攝的照片，才有同樣的大小，俾能將各項照片併在一起，湊成一幅總圖。至於飛機的高度，應視所需照片的大小，和所攝地區的廣狹而定。這是一種需要極大的準確性的工作，故攝取照片時飛機必須筆直地作着水平飛行，但是這時敵人的高射砲和驅逐機，極易加以攻擊；所以偵察機在危險區域的上空，欲拍攝地面的景象，非依賴其他飛機的護衛不可。</p>
<p>除在空中向地面垂直拍攝的照片以外，有時尚須拍攝斜視的照片，始能發現某種重要的綫索，飛機要攝得這種照片，常須飛行極低，因此也更加危險，此時地面上的機關槍，甚至步槍，都能把它打下來。</p>
<p>最近的轟炸機，每次突襲以後，必將轟炸的地區，攝於照片上面，以便改進其轟炸的準確性。</p>
<p>三，此次英法德意諸國，在爭奪殖民地的戰事中間，往往有許多區域，沒有地圖可資研究。空中照相便能够滿足一部份的需要。除上述各項拍攝的方法以外，又有一種遠距離照相機，能够將遙遠的景物，清晰地拍攝下來。現在尚有一種特製的，能感受赤外光綫的底片，可於大霧迷漫的天氣，攝取地面一切景物，其清晰的程度，較之晴天所攝的照片，並無遜色。</p>
<p>偵察機上的照相員，似乎不甚爲人注意，其實他的重要，正不亞於轟炸員和戰鬥員呢。</p>

<p>有人說人生在世是要努力去改進一切以謀後代的福利。有人說人生的意義是創造宇宙繼續的生命。生物書告訴我們；人類的生活在世界上是爲了維持和繼續自己種族的生命。這些答覆使你滿意嗎？</p>
<p>Henry　David　Thorean曾說過：「人類的生命被瑣細的事物輾碎了；我們需要的是簡單。簡單是我們生活的方式。但是如今虛僞和欺詐視爲世界上的真情，而事實反被視作荒誕的。我們必須要把我們的腳插入滿佈全球任何地方的污泥－意見。偏見。成見以及欺詐浮面等－。直到我們的腳碰到一塊硬的地方，那就是事實或真理。然後我們可以立一個標記，讓我們以後的日子有了一個憑藉。只要見到事實，你就可以快活地結束你人間的事業了。探求真理是人生唯一的目的。」</p>
<p>探求真理是人生的目的。</p>

<p>八月六日拙作「撒謊的必要」一文中有「從窮苦家庭出身的兒童，撒謊的比從寬裕的家庭出來的兒童多；女孩子撒謊的次數平均比男孩子多」等語，頃有讀者質詢關於以上兩點之根據。按Louttit所著之「臨牀心理」（Chnical　Psychology）及Harshorne　&amp;　May所著之「欺騙的研究」（Studies　in　Deceipt）兩書，均有此種統計材料發表。故該文中所提出之兩點，均係美國心理學家實際研究及調查之結果，並非鄙人杜撰者。因恐引起誤會，特此聲明。</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第五章　惡消息</p>
<p>「以後他可曾打過電話到　裏？」</p>
<p>「還沒有，我們正等他的消息呢。」</p>
<p>我擱好了電話筒回到辦公室中時，心裏着實有些慌。難道霍桑會遭遇什麼意外？施桂站在我的旁邊，他的嘴裏雖不說話，眼晴裏却明明充滿了關切的疑問。</p>
<p>我因作簡語向他解釋：「我跟霍先生在亞東旅館裏分手。我到樓上去監視一個人，他在電話間跟倪探長接談。現在經警察署裏的報告，那電話好像是突然中斷的。」</p>
<p>施桂顫聲道：「包先生，你想霍先生會不會遭到什麼意外？」</p>
<p>我簡直不能回答，但瞧了施桂那副神態，又不能不答。</p>
<p>「也許不會，施桂你別慌——」</p>
<p>電話的鈴聲又響了。我接應以後，才知是倪金壽。</p>
<p>他急促地說道：「包先生，霍先生還沒有消息嗎？」</p>
<p>我答道：「沒有，我正要問你啊。」</p>
<p>他又急促地說；「消息很不好，他已中了槍！……好，你等一等，我馬上就來。」</p>
<p>霍桑中了槍！這消息怎麼不使我吃驚？他在那裏中槍？在亞東的電話間裏嗎？可是我下電梯時，在電梯間門前站過一站，也曾向電話間方面瞧過一瞧，並不曾瞧見霍桑。　（八一）</p>

<h3>名伶會串中之二大戲劇</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>滬上南北名伶，爲伶界聯合會籌募經費，將於二十，二十一，二十二三日，舉行會串於大舞台，劇目露佈，有龍鳳呈祥，割髮代首，大名府等戲，名伶盛劇，支配齊整，洵不愧爲一九四〇年滬上梨園之羣英大會矣。</p>
<p>綜觀三日劇目，其最値得注意者，當推割髮代首與大名府連演史文恭二戲，此二劇在往昔梨園，無不盛行一時，近年以來，梨園伶人「明星」制度之日益發展，於是此生旦凈丑文武並重之劇，竟漸淪爲冷戲，良可惜也！</p>
<p>割髮代首，早年爲武生之正工戲，自譚鑫培氏以鬚生應行，於是鬚生甚至以不能動此劇爲恥，叔岩盛時，亦每以此劇爲號召，風氣所趨，一變而爲鬚生之正工武生所應行矣。會串以周信芳飾張繡，趙如泉飾曹操，芙蓉草飾鄒氏，張翼鵬林樹森分飾前後典韋，李仲林飾胡車兒，搭配齊整，工力悉敵，預料其演出，當可使顧曲者大殺戲　矣。</p>
<p>大名府演盧俊義逼上梁山事，所包含角色，無論生旦凈丑末，文武二行，與割髮代首向一爲吃重戲，早年余嘗數數於鄉間草台班中見之，當時如文武老生小聾甏之盧俊義，花旦海棠紅之賈氏，麻子小面之李固，每至一處露演此劇，遠近必爭相往觀，演至豪奴淫婦串通陷主時，觀者無不髮指，及梁山好漢刦法塲，一時又歡聲雷動，其表演之認眞，令人如處其境。會串周信芳飾廬俊義，芙蓉草飾賈氏，韓金奎飾李固，趙如泉飾時遷，並由蓋叫天擔任史文恭一角，以信芳之悲昂，桐珊之潑辣，金奎之狠毒，如泉之老練，而益以蓋叫天之武工，珠聯璧合，宜亦可以轟動一時矣。</p>
<h3>趙如泉重排陸根榮</h3>
<p>— 泰晤居士</p>
<p>—金泰雯加入飾黃慧如—</p>
<p>今年海上遊藝界也好像在提倡「復古運動」，民間故事，如孟姜女，描金鳳，華麗緣等，電影界把它搬上銀慕，二十年前轟動一時的閻瑞生謀斃王蓮英一案，梨園界重把它搬上舞台，開演已近一月，售座仍盛。</p>
<p>因鑒於「閻瑞生」新劇的受普通階級人所歡迎（所謂中級趣味），現在共舞台決以十二年前一件全僕相戀的故事，重行搬演，乃是「黃慧如與陸根榮」。</p>
<p>當時海上首先排演此戲的，乃是上海舞台（卽今天蟾原址）由趙如泉飾陸根榮，趙君玉飾黃慧如，連演數月之久，賣座始終不衰。三年復趙如泉搭三星舞台，重排此戲，依然能够叫座。</p>
<p>現在趙如泉又將以此十二年前之應時戲，重演於共舞台上，而由新角全素雯飾黃慧如，共舞台之演員，夙以演新劇聞於時，更兼該台之佈景，在上海堪稱首屈一指，日內正在排練之中，將繼「新天河配」之後上演。</p>
<p>聞其中最像眞佈景，爲交易所市塲，日昇樓市景，四馬路靑蓮閣野鷄拉客流氓吃講茶，東亞旅館，法院開審，台上搭台等等，其最精彩者爲連環變景，如日昇樓一變而爲先施公司商塲之內景，且置有扶梯，購物者熙攘往來；再一變爲東亞旅館之電梯，黃陸携手而入，電梯由下上升；更一變則爲旅館內景，電梯由台下上升，黃陸自電梯中出，上述種種，均以最迅捷之方式變換之。</p>
<p>白玉豔亦爲該台新聘要角，在此劇中，特在台上再搭一共舞台門口之景，一變而爲共舞台內部，案目及觀客甚衆，黃陸亦爲座上客之一，台上再置一小型之共舞台，此小台則供白玉豔演劇之用，白每日演舊劇一齣，或大打出手之武戲，或唱做兼重之文戲，新戲中夾老戲，戲中串戲，亦舞台上之別開生面者，演出之日，其盛况可預期也。</p>
<h3>留英戲劇家　黃作霖加入劇藝社</h3>
<p>— 琳</p>
<p>任「小城故事」導演</p>
<p>暑期公演形將完畢的上海劇藝社，他們早計劃在秋季公演開始之後，在人材方面，要大加充實，這計劃已經在逐步的實行了。首先是留英戲劇家黃作霖加入了劇藝社，黃氏在英國攻過幾年的戲劇科，學識和經騐都很豐富，是全國僅有的幾個留外戲劇專家中間的一個新幹材。他回到中國，曾在國立戲劇學校當過敎援，培養造就了許多戰劇靑年。現在，他爲劇藝社聘請，開始在執行袁　俊編的五慕喜劇，「小城故事」，工作是那麽愼重而認眞。我們在「夜上海」之後，就可以看到他的導演的作品。除此之外，還有一位留美的戲劇家和一位留英的表演家要加入劇藝社。在濱員方面，也會函的正內地工作的出色的演員來滬參加。同時在「暑期訓練班」裏又造就了不少的新人，預料當有六七人被錄取作爲正式演員。照這情形看來，入秋後的上海劇藝社又有一番新的作為了。</p>
<h3>關於「孔夫子」</h3>
<p>— 羅村</p>
<p>民華影業公司的處女作「孔夫子」，經過八月的攝製，現在已全部完竣。聞將於本月二十七日孔子誕辰在大光明公映。該片是由費穆導演，我們知道他的作風，一向不苟且，不濫造的，我們相信這决導演「孔夫子」一定會有美好的收穫。關於該片有幾點値得向各位讀者報吿的：</p>
<p>全片共耗去膠片一萬六千多尺，經剪接後，留剩三分之二。</p>
<p>佈景——如宮殿等一切偉大的建設，都由費穆的令弟親目設計，他的令弟是某大學土木工程學士，並且對於考古亦很有硏究，所以把「孔夫子」的故鄉景色，都很認眞的搬造，到公映時，我們可以一飽眼福了。</p>
<p>攝製子路力戰死難一塲，因表演逼眞，激鬥過烈，有一位演員自兩丈餘的衛高台上跌下受傷，張翼亦有槍刀傷多處，可知各演員，都很賣力。</p>
<p>費穆爲對「孔夫子」尊重起見，要求公司當局不以個人與孔夫子合攝的照片在任何報章上公開發表，可見費君對聖人尊敬的態度。</p>
<p>據說南洋各屬影片商人，都紛紛向民棄購買「孔夫子」拷貝，原來南洋華僑，都有尊孔的心理，自從「孔夫子」影片攝製後，他們早就注意到了。至於該片的陣容，抄錄如后：</p>
<p>唐槐秋—飾孔夫子。</p>
<p>慕容婉兒—飾南子。</p>
<p>張翼—飾子路。</p>
<p>徐立—飾陽貨。</p>

<h3>15,000 Japanese Soldiers from Taiwan Arrive at Hainan Island to Threaten Vietnam. Haikou Becomes the Center of Japanese Military Activities. Battles Continue Around Ding'an and Jiaji.</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to local Chinese newspapers, more than 15,000 Japanese soldiers have arrived at Hainan Island from Taiwan, preparing to attack Vietnam. The key port of Haikou on the island has now become the center of Japanese military activities. A large number of transport ships are busily unloading soldiers, field artillery, tanks, armored vehicles, and food supplies. In addition to two elite regiments of Japanese troops from North China, there are also Koreans, Taiwanese, and puppet troops. These troops are stationed in Haikou, Qiongshan, and Lingao on the northern coast of Hainan Island, ready to be dispatched to Haiphong at a moment's notice. The tall buildings in Haikou have been occupied by the Japanese army and used as barracks and military supply depots. All troops must train under the scorching sun to acclimate to the tropical climate. Japanese soldiers are frequently seen coming and going on the streets and in the suburbs of Haikou.</p>
<p>It is reported that the naval base in Yulin Port, Sanya, and Yazhou Bay in the south of Hainan Island has been completed in fact. The repair dock in Yulin Port has also been completed, capable of repairing ships up to 10,000 tons. Three Japanese light cruisers are currently undergoing repairs in the dock. It is rumored that Japanese torpedo boats and submarines in Sanya and Yazhou Bay are loading food supplies. The construction of this naval base began ten months ago. A large number of laborers were forced to serve under the strict protection of the Japanese navy, and the construction work was extremely secretive. Strict measures were taken to prevent intruders and spies. In Ding'an and Jiaji in the northern part of Hainan Island, Chinese and Japanese troops are engaged in scattered battles. The Chinese side has mobilized more than 3,000 local Li and Miao people to resist. These indigenous people are extremely resentful of the Japanese army's previous air raids, which killed 300 of their people. The Wuzhi Mountain in the center of Hainan Island is still in the hands of the Chinese army. (International News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>US-Canada Joint Defense</h3>
<p>As a result of the meeting between US President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King in Ogdensburg on the evening of the 17th, a joint statement was issued on the 18th, stating, "The two sides have agreed that Canada and the United States should immediately organize a permanent joint committee on defense, to begin studying naval, land, and air problems immediately, and to consider the defense of the northern part of the Western Hemisphere from a broad perspective; this committee will be organized by four or five representatives from each side, mostly selected from the naval, land, and air forces." Canada is part of the British Empire. Last September, it followed Britain in declaring war on Germany and is now continuing to fight in Europe. The expeditionary force has already departed one after another, and it is making every effort to supply air force personnel and materials. At this time, the establishment of an agreement with the United States of a defensive alliance nature is, of course, a very thought-provoking and noteworthy event. The scope and specific methods of US-Canada joint defense may not yet be secretly determined; in short, they have not been revealed and cannot be speculated upon. What is credible is that the attitude of the US and Canada towards each other will be open and honest, and they will trust each other sincerely. In nature and in spirit, the US will definitely not invade or take advantage of the situation; it will completely respect Canada's sovereignty and original national status; and Canada will definitely not abandon Great Britain, willingly humbling itself and becoming a vassal of the US. Facts are still needed to explain what is to come: On the one hand, Canada is loyal to Great Britain and is doing its best to fight; on the other hand, how will it be loyal to the US-Canada joint defense agreement and do its best to share the heavy responsibility of naval, land, and air defense in the northern part of the Western Hemisphere with the US? There is no doubt that both the US and Canada have a deep understanding of this point, but what the actual dimensions are is probably what the world wants to know as soon as possible!</p>
<p>The US faces the Atlantic Ocean on the left and controls the Pacific Ocean on the right. The Atlantic Ocean side causes the US to deal with complex factors because of the complexity of the European situation, which affects the future of the US in every way. The Pacific Ocean side causes the US to deal with complex factors because of the distance of Hawaii and the Philippines, which extend into the Far East, and the complex relations, which involve the current interests of the US in every way. Dealing with both sides in this way makes the US feel the need to unite the Americas more urgently. Therefore, analyzing the international policy of the US, to the east towards Europe, to the south towards the countries of Central and South America, to the west towards the Far East, and to the north towards Canada, the objectives pursued are completely different because the objects are completely different. Only by comprehensively observing the east, south, west, and north can the entire national policy of the US be seen. The current overall international situation places the US in an environment where it must carefully consider various factors. Compared to other countries in the world, even if each country has its unprecedented difficulties and dangers, it also has its own specialty; for example, China is only fighting against Japan to seek final victory, Japan is only seeking to complete its aggression against China, Britain is urgently dealing with Germany, Germany and Italy are urgently dealing with Britain; the Soviet Union can still wait and see, while the US cannot stand idly by and must do something, but there are thousands of threads. The Soviet Union has at least maintained complete freedom of initiative at present, while the US's initiative still needs to be struggled for in order to ensure complete security. Not only that, but China's being invaded, France's being conquered, and Britain's fighting alone are all warnings to the US, and they are all threats that the US feels. President Roosevelt and other far-sighted people are exhausting their minds and energies to figure out how to carry out their national policy, how to fulfill the various responsibilities and morals that the US cannot get rid of to its own country, to the Americas, to the European situation, and to the Far East. But there have been great achievements one after another. The Pan-American Conference in early July formed a further unity for the countries of Central and South America; now, for Canada, joint defense is determined; all these acts of righteousness have supreme value in politics, economics, and military affairs, and the fundamental significance lies in the penetration of the American spirit throughout the Americas, creating a basis for good harmony and close cooperation.</p>
<p>If the US cannot unite the Americas, it will be a fatal failure for the US; it will lack a sound basis for the US to deal with international affairs outside the Americas; as for the future, the US will inevitably complete its technological construction in the Americas on the one hand, and show the activity of its policies in the international community on the other hand.</p>
<h3>US and Canada Sign Joint Defense Alliance, Organize Permanent Joint Committee to Consider Defense of the Northern Part of the Western Hemisphere</h3>
<p>Ogdensburg: When US President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King held an important meeting in President Roosevelt's special train yesterday, the two sides agreed to establish a permanent joint committee for Canada and the United States to plan the defense of the Western Hemisphere. The committee will also jointly study "issues related to the sea, land, and air, including personnel and raw materials, etc." After the meeting, the two sides issued a statement stating, "The permanent joint defense committee will be organized by four or five representatives from each country, most of whom will be active military personnel, and the meeting will be convened soon." President Roosevelt's meeting with Prime Minister King lasted from 6:15 PM on Saturday to 1:00 AM yesterday. The statement did not mention Canada's participation in the European war as an autonomous dominion, but the agreement reiterated President Roosevelt's assurance to King in Ontario, Canada, that the United States would not stand idly by if Canada was threatened by a North American country. After the US-Canada agreement, the United States and Britain will negotiate the purchase or lease of sea and air bases on British islands in the Western Hemisphere. (Dispatch on the 19th by the United Press)</p>
<p>Ogdensburg: President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King jointly issued a statement yesterday, saying that they have agreed that Canada and the United States should immediately organize a permanent joint committee on defense, to begin studying sea, land, and air issues immediately, and to consider the defense of the northern part of the Western Hemisphere from a broad perspective. The two sides will each send four or five representatives to form this committee, most of whom will be selected from the sea, land, and air forces. After the statement was issued, President Roosevelt set off for his summer villa in Hyde Park. (Dispatch on the 19th by Reuters)</p>
<p>Washington: Today, people here have expressed their approval of the establishment of a permanent joint defense mechanism between Canada and believe that it is an effective means to enhance the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Isolationists have unanimously praised this plan, and administrative officials have also fully supported this joint defense mechanism. Senator Holder of the Democratic Party of Sifford and Niger, while expressing approval of this mechanism, also issued a warning, saying that if the British government moves to Canada, it will introduce the war into the United States; if Canada wants the United States to defend its territory, it must allow the British government not to move to the Western Hemisphere. Senator Thomas of the Democratic Party of Utah said that this mechanism is very good and will be beneficial to us. Congressman Bloom of the Democratic Party of New York also said that this mechanism is excellent. Senator Van Nuys of the Democratic Party of Indiana told a reporter from the United Press that he would do his best to cooperate with this mechanism. Senator George of the Democratic Party of Georgia said that this plan is very good because it can allow the United States to obtain bases in the Atlantic Ocean, but he also said that any formal agreement must be like a treaty and should first be approved by Congress. This remark has made some observers wonder whether President Roosevelt has been authorized to establish this mechanism, but legal circles believe that President Roosevelt has been authorized to build this mechanism and does not need the approval of Congress. (Dispatch on the 19th by the United Press)</p>
<p>Washington: Republican Senator Vandenberg commented on the proposal to establish a permanent joint defense committee between the United States and Canada, saying that the defense of Canada is the ultimate and unavoidable responsibility of the United States. According to the senators and representatives of the foreign affairs committees of the two houses who attended the meeting yesterday to express their opinions, they all expressed their support for the declaration issued by President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King on the establishment of a joint defense committee. (Dispatch on the 19th by Reuters)</p>
<p>Ottawa: The administrative circles here believe that the agreement between US President Roosevelt and Canadian Prime Minister King to establish a permanent joint defense mechanism between the US and Canada is very important. According to US official opinion, the progress of this matter will increase Canada's status as a North American country. People in the US believe that this agreement will allow Canada to fully join the maintenance of the Monroe Doctrine. It is also said that this understanding is sufficient to serve as a medium for cooperation between the US and Britain on the defense of the Western Hemisphere. Political circles here believe that Prime Minister King has been authorized to represent the British Empire in participating in the defense of the Western Hemisphere, and some specific proposals are expected to be established. (Dispatch on the 19th by the United Press)</p>
<p>Ottawa: Colonel White Legan Lee, former Assistant Secretary of the Army in the cabinet of US President Wilson, recently responded to the invitation of the Canadian Minister of Information and broadcast to the entire country, saying, "What I hope for from my country is that the United States will draw its sword to fight for freedom and humanity. I pay tribute to Canada, which has no doubts. For the sake of their own interests, and in terms of both wisdom and courage, the countries of the Western Hemisphere should follow in Canada's footsteps and provide Britain with unreserved assistance. If the Americas remain asleep and Britain declines, then the Americas will regret it too late when they wake up. The world cannot survive in a state of half-slave and half-free. Hitler knows this, so he drives his nation, which is good at trampling on others, to destroy the last fortress of freedom." (Dispatch on the 19th by Reuters)</p>

<h3>Japanese Ships Ordered to Avoid British Ports, Overseas Chinese Will Be Unable to Leave Britain</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Those overseas Chinese who wish to leave Britain may not be able to do so because German announced on August 17th a counter-blockade against Britain, and Japanese ships can no longer reach various ports in Britain. The Ministry of Communications ordered the Japanese Yusen Company's ship Suma Maru, which was scheduled to arrive in Liverpool on August 18th, to leave the dangerous area and avoid berthing at a suitable port.

<h3>Japan Will Prohibit the Sale of Luxury Goods, 300 Million Yen Worth of Inventory Difficult to Dispose of in the Short Term</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese government has issued a notice prohibiting the domestic sale of various luxury goods from October 7th of this year. General merchants are planning to clear their inventory before the ban is implemented. Among them, silk fabrics, such as embroidery, gold thread, and silver thread inlaid fabrics, have a total inventory of 300 million yen. It is impossible to dispose of them in the extremely short period of seven weeks. The only option is to reweave them into other things, remove their gorgeous colors, and relaunch them on the market. Regarding this matter, the Osaka Prefectural Government's Economic Section has temporarily agreed with the store owners to assist them in transforming luxury goods into plain daily-use clothing. In addition, pearls and gems are also prohibited. The Kobe Jewelers Association is now planning to stop manufacturing ornaments and convert the factory to manufacture various instrument parts, which has been tested once and the results are satisfactory.

<h3>Italy Considers Attacking Aden</h3>
<p>Rome: Authoritative sources recently stated that once the Japanese army completely occupies British Somaliland, the Italian army will not rest for a moment and will continue to attack Aden in order to completely control the Red Sea and cut off the supply of military supplies and reinforcements to British territories in the Near East. Although the Italians generally acknowledge that Aden is more difficult to attack than Somaliland, most are optimistic because the Italians believe that there are three methods sufficient to force Aden to surrender, and they say that this method can also be used simultaneously. Aden is to Italy as Britain is to Germany, the problem is the same, holding that the former's scope is smaller, because Italy's attack on Aden also requires troops to cross the sea to attack, and although Britain's navy in Aden is not very large, it is stronger than Italy's navy in East Africa. Most of the Italian fleet is currently in the Mediterranean, but according to observers, Italy has a large number of aircraft in East Africa, which Britain cannot match. The Italian army may consider transporting troops by plane to attack Aden, which is also unknown, because Italy used planes to transport troops when advancing into Albania. The second method to make Aden submit is to blockade. The Italian army can use its air superiority to have planes bomb all supply ships sailing to Aden. Aden is surrounded by barren land with no food production, and even drinking water must be transported from outside. Once Italy implements a blockade, this British colony will immediately feel a terrible poverty. Also, this blockade can also be carried out by bombing Aden's reservoirs and water tanks. Water is an extremely precious item in Aden. I have been to the site twice during the Italian-Albanian war, so I know. The third method to capture Aden is a diplomatic method, which may be used in conjunction with other means. Mussolini has worked hard to promote the friendship between Italy and Arab countries, and has an even stronger friendship with the King of Yemen. All the areas in front of Aden are related to Yemen, and the Yemen tribes are often heard to have not very good feelings with Britain. Therefore, Italy may be able to obtain the assistance of Yemen or at least obtain the permission of the King of Yemen for the Italian army to attack Aden from land through its territory.

<h3>General Comfort Association Telegraphed to Report Income and Expenditure Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing. The National General Comfort Association telegraphed the whole country on the 18th to report on the income and expenditure of donations, stating briefly: The association handles national comfort affairs, and all administrative expenses are jointly maintained by participating agencies, without using any donations. In addition to issuing formal receipts for all donations received, they are all compiled and published in the Central Daily News or simultaneously published in several newspapers. The use of donations is decided in advance at meetings of representatives from various agencies, and afterwards, the auditing situation is reviewed by representatives from the Audit Department stationed in the association and reported to the Audit Department and participating agencies for their records. A list of donations collected up to the end of June of this year is being compiled for printing. The spring festival comfort funds received in Chongqing totaled more than 600,000 yuan, and more than 400,000 yuan have been remitted from other places one after another, all of which have been published in newspapers one by one. According to the regulations for the implementation of spring festival comfort activities, the recipients of the gifts are frontline soldiers, honored veterans, new recruits, and families of those resisting aggression. The association: (1) Entrusted the Logistics Department's Political Department with 160,000 yuan to continue running five general teams of wounded soldier reception centers, totaling 120 centers, which are currently distributed in the front lines of various war zones [text missing]; (2) Used more than 200,000 yuan to comfort the national air force and handle air raid relief and funeral subsidies for families of those resisting aggression, as well as to comfort honored veterans and volunteer soldiers; (3) Plans to invest 300,000 yuan in developing production enterprises for families of those resisting aggression and has requested the Agricultural Production Promotion Association and the China Industrial Cooperative Association to plan three to five anti-leprosy factories on their behalf, and is selecting factory sites in [text missing] and other places, which will be promoted to various parts of the country in the future; (4) Will donate 500,000 yuan (if the spring festival donations are insufficient, the association will find other ways to make up for it) to frontline soldiers and has decided to organize four comfort groups to go to various war zones to deliver gifts, stipulating that they be delivered to the (regiment) level, with each group using 500 yuan as the standard for a meat meal for the entire group. It was originally scheduled to depart on (July 7), but because the Nanyang Overseas Chinese Comfort Group was comforting the front lines at that time and comfort groups from various places were also traveling frequently, it was decided to postpone the departure to (August 13). However, due to transportation issues, negotiations for vehicles and gasoline have not yet been resolved. Furthermore, because the meaning of gift-giving is more about spirit than material, secretly distributing the gifts has little impact. The association is currently researching various ways to find a satisfactory and effective method. If various circles wish to further understand all of the association's work and income and expenditure, the association's upcoming General Situation of Association Affairs and List of Donations can be consulted.

<h3>German Air Force Offensive Against Britain Subdued Yesterday; German Losses in the Air Battle the Day Before Were Extremely Heavy; British Planes Attacked Boulogne, Dropping Three Tons of Bombs</h3>
<p>London. After suffering heavy losses of 140 aircraft yesterday, Germany's air blitz has diminished in intensity today. One German bomber appeared over a city in the southeast this afternoon, circled for several weeks, and dropped two bombs, both of which landed in open fields.

The Air Ministry claims that a German bomber was shot down in southern London yesterday by soldiers of the Home Guard using Lee-Enfield rifles. A joint communique issued by the Air Ministry and the Ministry of Home Security stated that recent reports have confirmed that the general damage from enemy air raids on Britain yesterday was not significant. However, several high-explosive bombs fell on a city in southeastern England, destroying several houses and causing minor casualties. Last night's air raid was small in scale. Several bombs fell on some parts of England and southern Wales, causing minimal damage and injuring only a few people. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

Air force observers here pointed out that although Germany has declared a complete blockade of Britain, the points where German forces concentrate their air raids are all aimed at eliminating Britain's resistance, so as to facilitate German landing attempts. Observers here believe that last week's air blitz was a prelude to the cooperation of other German forces. The targets of German attacks are all aircraft factories and munitions factories, which are sufficient to weaken Britain's long-term resistance. (19th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<p>Air Battle Situation Near London</p>
<p>London. The Air Ministry Intelligence Department stated that two bombs hit a commercial center in a London suburb, and when some people ran into air raid shelters, they were strafed by enemy aircraft. Several areas were also bombed in the evening. A warden in a certain town stated that when enemy aircraft flew to the town, they were only 80 feet high. Three or four German aircraft several miles away appeared to be out of control. When passing through the streets of a certain village, they flew so low that they touched the chimney of a village house, dropping a bomb that landed on the roof, causing several shops in the neighborhood to be destroyed. An elderly woman, aged ninety, who refused to take refuge in an air raid shelter, was killed in the bombing. Several bombs fell in the cemetery of a church in another town, shattering tombstones. Enemy aircraft were severely hit by British fighter planes and crashed in the countryside. Some German aircrew members died in the fires, and the rest were quickly captured. At noon yesterday, the southern outskirts of London, Kent, and other areas in southeastern and southern England were also bombed. There were minor civilian casualties near Croydon. Casualties from bombing elsewhere were light, and material damage was also minimal. In the evening, large numbers of German aircraft crossed the southeastern coast near Dover, attempting to break through the London defense line along the banks of the Thames estuary. However, they were repelled by British fighter planes over Kent and Essex. According to incomplete information received, material damage from last night's air raids was slight, and there were few casualties. Several British Air Force airfields were bombed, causing some deaths and injuries. According to unofficial reports, 42 enemy aircraft rushed towards the London area last night but did not reach their targets, as they were stopped by anti-aircraft guns and intercepted by British fighter planes. They turned and fled back to sea. At night, the skies over a certain town in Essex were densely packed with about 100 German bombers. British fighter planes met them head-on, and the crowds ignored the calls of the air raid wardens and gathered at the doors to watch the battle, cheering wildly every time a German aircraft crashed. Furthermore, 40 German dive bombers escorted by fighter planes heavily attacked airfields in the southeastern region, and were fiercely attacked by British aircraft emerging from the clouds. It is generally believed that about 15 people were killed or injured around the airfield, including two young women. Airfields and ports in southern and southeastern England were attacked again. London residents heard the roar of anti-aircraft guns for the first time. Coastal batteries from Essex to Hampshire also shelled. Two alarms were issued in London in the evening, and the loud explosion of 17 bombs dropped on the suburbs could be clearly heard. A squadron of Spitfire British aircraft engaged a formation of German bombers attacking airfields over Surrey and destroyed six German bombers and five fighters in an instant. A squadron of Hurricane British fighters patrolling over Kent saw five Messerschmitt German bombers at an altitude of 11,000 meters and climbed to shoot down all five aircraft. There were two break-ins over Hampshire, the first at 1 p.m., when nine British fighters shot down nine enemy aircraft. An hour later, 11 British fighters intercepted another batch of enemy aircraft and shot down all 11 of them. A reporter who witnessed the enemy aircraft attacking the London area reported that the enemy aircraft first came in at an altitude of 25,000 to 30,000 feet, and their presence was only known from the occasional reflection of sunlight on the tips and the sound of their engines. Nearby residents quickly entered air raid shelters, and British fighter planes had already begun to engage. Soon, judging from the sound of the aircraft, it was known that the enemy aircraft had turned back from not far from its destination. About a quarter of an hour later, bombers were seen arriving and diving rapidly to bomb. The houses shook as bombs exploded and anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely. When the enemy aircraft returned, those who looked up saw enemy aircraft falling and being pursued separately by British fighters. Another reporter in the southeastern area stated that the enemy aircraft came in three groups, each with 12 aircraft, flying in a V formation. It was seen that one group rapidly descended towards a certain target to drop bombs, while the remaining two groups flew in other directions. British Spitfire fighters then followed closely in pursuit. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

A merchant ship (4,000 tons) was sunk in the English Channel, and another was severely damaged. German aircraft and enemy aircraft engaged in fierce battles with enemy aircraft in various places. 51 enemy aircraft were destroyed by the Air Force brigade led by Lieutenant Colonel Huss. It is rare for one air force squadron to achieve such a great battle record. Last night, German fighters bombed the large gasoline pond in eastern London, the arsenals in Norwich and Essex, the port facilities in Milford Haven, Bournemouth, and Weymouth, and several airfields in southern England and near Liverpool. The sky was lit up by flames, and explosions were heard far and wide. Several ships in the aforementioned ports were damaged by bombs.

<h3>Britain Prepares to Attack When the Time is Right; Morrison Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>London. British Minister of Supply Morrison said yesterday: "Britain is preparing to launch a large-scale offensive when the time is right. Three months ago, the situation was serious, but the situation has changed, and I am very gratified. Although today's situation is not yet satisfactory, we have already placed in the hands of the army the weapons that are sufficient to defeat the enemy. Even if the enemy attacks tonight, our army will be able to deal with it effectively. After the navy's protection, supplemented by the great resources of the British Empire, the United States, and other neutral countries, and our firm determination not to fail, we will be able to reach a position in a few weeks that is worthy of appropriately trusting to cope with everything. Once the current crisis has passed, our armed strength will be even stronger." After listing the numbers of war equipment that the Ministry of Supply has procured, Morrison said that in recent months, the war equipment industry has greatly increased because it has purchased refined steel from the United States. Germany's statement that Britain lacks steelmaking raw materials is false, because Britain has an abundant supply of British Empire and foreign iron ore, so there is no need to worry about a lack of sources. Morrison went on to talk about post-war construction, saying that many of Britain's weaknesses before the war were the result of a lack of appropriate economic and management planning. We are willing to eliminate inequality and eliminate insecurity and fear, and we want all aspects to have more complete, freer, and more creative national life opportunities.

<h3>British Air Force's Unprecedented Victory; British Newspapers Enthusiastically Praise</h3>
<p>London. Today's Times enthusiastically praised the unprecedented victory of the British Air Force last week, saying that the only credible point in the various propaganda from the German General Command and the German Propaganda Ministry about the air raids on Britain is that they often call this air raid a large-scale offensive. This is evidenced by the number of aircraft used last week, especially the German aircraft that attacked our country's coast on Thursday, estimated at about 1,000. The only possible conclusion is that we have already secured a steady victory in the first round of the Battle of Britain. The newspaper's diplomatic reporter claimed that the various false propaganda released by Germany over the weekend was clearly intended to lure Japan and Spain, judging from the German radio station's selection of all comments from Japanese and Spanish newspapers over the weekend, which can show that Germany is eager to understand the effect of its propaganda. Germany believes that the false propaganda during the Norway campaign (such as saying that Germany had sunk half of the British Navy) was very helpful in swaying Italy to join the war. Now it hopes that fabricating the result of Britain's "lack of resistance" can similarly lure Japan and Spain. The Germans have filled the pages of newspapers in Japan and Spain with their propaganda, probably believing that they can cover up the truth. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Use Smoke to Write Words in the British Sky</h3>

<p>Rome: Mussolini’s spokesman, Gayda, declared yesterday in Rome that the fate of British Somaliland is already decided. A large contingent of British troops began embarking on ships on Saturday for Aden to avoid the advance of Italian forces. Gayda also attacked the civil and military officials of French Somaliland, condemning them for assisting the British after France and Italy signed a peace treaty.

<h3>British Fleet Bombards Italian Fortifications in Libya, Causing Damage to the Capuzzo Fortress</h3>
<p>Somewhere in the Mediterranean: A Reuters correspondent with the British Mediterranean Fleet reports on the bombardment of Bardia and Capuzzo fortresses by the British fleet on Saturday. After receiving intelligence from the British army along the Libyan border, the British fleet set sail on Friday afternoon, proceeding without lights through the night. At dawn on Saturday, they formed a line several miles off the Libyan coast. Shortly after, bugles sounded, ordering fire to commence at 7:00 AM. Minutes before the start of firing, the correspondent climbed a ladder and crouched near the smokestack. The commander and staff stood on the bridge, while artillerymen, wearing steel helmets, waited by their guns, everyone with cotton stuffed in their ears. At 7:00 AM, the cannons opened fire, from six-inch to fifteen-inch guns firing together. The air vibrated, and smoke filled the sky. We could barely stand due to the shock, and when the sixteen-inch cannons fired, the warship shuddered violently from the recoil, and my knees buckled. Tons of shells and explosives flew toward the enemy positions. Navy reconnaissance planes circled above, reporting that the fifteen-inch guns were hitting their targets accurately. One shell scored a direct hit on the Capuzzo fortress, eight miles inland, causing extensive damage. Another shell landed in the camp. The small Italian fort of Lanra was almost completely destroyed after a few minutes of intense bombardment. The cannons then concentrated on destroying locations where enemy forces were concentrated. All four British ships hit their targets. The barracks in Bardia were also damaged. After half an hour of continuous bombardment, the firing ceased. British fighter planes accompanying the British fleet destroyed five enemy aircraft while the British ships were bombarding Bardia and Capuzzo fortresses. Two more enemy aircraft were probably lost. British aircraft first engaged an Italian seaplane attacking the British fleet, causing it to catch fire and crash. Shortly after, a squadron of seventy-nine type enemy aircraft attacked, but were scattered by British aircraft. Two Italian aircraft crashed. Soon after, another large squadron of seventy-nine type enemy aircraft flew towards the British fleet to attack. In the ensuing engagement, two more Italian aircraft caught fire and crashed. Another Italian aircraft was pursued and shot down by a British plane. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>

<h3>German Foreign Ministry Elaborates on the Meaning of the Total Blockade of England, Blockade Plan Does Not Target Neutral Countries, Absolute Adherence to General Principles of International Law</h3>
<p>Berlin: Dr. Ritter, a German Foreign Ministry ambassador, declared to foreign journalists yesterday that the German note on the total blockade of England was delivered to the governments of various neutral countries the day before yesterday.

Regarding the issue of American ships going to England to evacuate children, the German government has not yet received a formal proposal and cannot express an opinion. The American government should contact the German government regarding this matter. The spokesperson stated that the total blockade of England is not an unrestricted submarine warfare. The British blockade plan targets not only Germany but also the non-occupied areas of France, and neutral countries such as Spain and Portugal are also affected by the naval certification system. The German blockade of England targets only England, and the means of blockade are not limited to submarines. Aircraft and speedboats also play an important role. The German blockade plan does not target neutral countries and strictly adheres to the general principles of international law. (Haitong dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Vichy: The French Minister of Production and Labor, Pétain, recently told reporters, "At this point, the free trade system has gradually disappeared. Countries around the world, regardless of their political system, are inclined towards a controlled economy. This phenomenon has existed for a long time and is not a new fact. This is because a country's economy must be subject to some control, which has always been the case. What is different from the past is that the question in the past depended on who implemented the control and for whose benefit. At this point, we are trying to implement a controlled economy for the common good, which refers to the interests of the nation and the people." (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>

<h3>China Press Reporter Cheng Zhenzhang Shot, Hit by Two Bullets, Recovery Progressing Well, Rickshaw Puller Injured by Stray Bullet</h3>
<p>At 10:45 AM yesterday, an assassination occurred at the intersection of Avenue See Ang Road and Route Pére Robert in the French Concession. The victim was China Press reporter Cheng Zhenzhang, who was shot twice. At the same time, a rickshaw puller was also injured by the thugs. The thugs then escaped in a car. The following is a report of the details:</p>
<p>(Attacked by Thugs Not Far From Home)</p>
<p>Cheng Zhenzhang is from Hangzhou, 30 years old, and resides at 17 Shun'an Lane, Avenue See Ang Road. He works at China Press as an international editor. At 10:45 AM yesterday morning, Cheng walked out of his residence intending to wait for the No. 21 bus at the intersection of Route Pére Robert to go to work. A white-牌 car was parked in front of No. 10, Lane 7, Avenue See Ang Road. Four thugs were lying in wait inside the car, and had been waiting there. Although there were many pedestrians on the street at the time, no one paid attention to it. When Cheng walked to the front of the Zhengda Rice Store at No. 9, two of the thugs suddenly got out of the car, both wearing black short shirts and trousers made of Xiangyunsha silk. One person grabbed Cheng's chest, and the other pulled out a pistol and shot Cheng. A total of three shots were fired. Cheng was hit by two bullets, one entering through his mouth and exiting through his left cheek, and the other entering through his abdomen and exiting through his lower back. He fell to the ground bleeding.</p>
<p>(Rickshaw Puller Also Hit by a Bullet)</p>
<p>Seeing that they had achieved their goal, the thugs were about to get back into the car and escape when a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei named Shen Pin You (27 years old, living at 222 Kangti Road, Ma Lang Road) suddenly heard the gunshots. Not knowing what was happening, he abandoned his rickshaw and fled. The thugs suspected he would report them to the police and aimed and fired a shot. The bullet hit the rickshaw puller in the buttocks, causing him to fall to the ground injured. At that time, the thugs got back into the car and fled north on Route Pére Robert. An Annamese policeman patrolling Route Pére Robert heard the news and drew his gun and chased after them, firing a shot at the car. The thugs also returned fire from the car, but no one was injured. However, the thugs managed to escape. Because the atmosphere was tense during the exchange of fire, the policeman was unable to record the license plate number of the car used by the thugs.</p>
<p>(Surgery Went Well)</p>
<p>As for Cheng, after being shot, he was rushed to the Guangci Hospital by ambulance. The French police also dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene of the incident to investigate. After Cheng arrived at Guangci Hospital, he immediately underwent surgery. The progress of the operation was quite good, but the liver was pierced by a bullet, and there was also minor damage to the intestines. As of yesterday afternoon, his temperature was only 37.1 degrees, and he was very alert. According to the doctor, he will be out of danger within three days if there are no changes. It is said that Cheng is not yet married and has only an elderly mother. His father is in Jinhua. Before the war, Cheng worked as an editor for the Chen Bao and Xin Bao. He is honest and amiable. After he was suddenly attacked yesterday morning, people from all walks of life sent their condolences to the newspaper.</p>

<p>At 6:00 PM yesterday, all British nationals and Chinese and foreign people in the city gathered at the Racecourse. The crowd was so large that people entered in single file through the side door of the Racecourse. The cars they arrived in stretched all the way to Avenue Edward VII Road and Chengdu Road, causing traffic congestion. Both stands inside the Racecourse were packed with people, with hardly any space left, numbering no less than 6,000. There were still more than 300 guests who were unable to enter and were blocked in the grassy area in the center of the Racecourse. In order to maintain order, in addition to dispatching detectives to direct traffic at each entrance, more than 30 Chinese and Western detectives were deployed throughout the venue to provide tight security.</p>
<p>(On the Reviewing Stand)</p>
<p>More than ten British military flags of various types fluttered in the wind on the stands. A corner of the northern stand was specially set aside as a reviewing stand for British officials. Mr. Cornell, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Major General Smyth of the U.S. Army, and other British and American leaders, more than ten in all, arrived early. At 6:30 PM, two cars drove in from outside. Under the gaze of all eyes, British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, British Commander Major General Simmons, British Consul-General George, and the leading consul, four in all, stepped out of the cars and, to the enthusiastic applause of all British nationals, were led by Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to the reviewing stand, where they shook hands with British and American leaders one by one before taking their seats in the front row of the reviewing stand to await the review.</p>
<p>(Performance and March)</p>
<p>At 6:45 PM, the bands of the East Surrey and West Yorkshire Regiments marched out in formation to thunderous applause from the guests. The East Surrey band, comprising 28 people, led by Mr. Henry, played and sang Scottish folk songs, walking back and forth in front of the stands for about 15 minutes. Following them, the West Yorkshire band, with about the same number of people, led by Mr. Operting, began playing another famous song, also marching in the same way in front of the stands. After the two bands performed separately, they joined forces and set off again, playing and singing an extremely beautiful and moving song. After the song, they lined up at the stands and paid their respects to the British officials. British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr stood up and returned the salute. Thus, amid the "Farewell Song" played loudly by the two bands and the cheers and applause, the 40-minute performance came to an end. British nationals flocked to the bands, offering the members extremely sincere farewell wishes. In the fading twilight, they shook hands and bid each other farewell.</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane Crashes and Burns at D场</h3>
<p>At the Japanese military airfield in the D场 town north of Shanghai, at around 5:00 AM yesterday (the 18th), three Japanese light bombers took off. As they were circling and ascending, one of them suddenly crashed to the ground and caught fire at a low altitude of several hundred feet above the ground. For a time, thick smoke billowed into the sky, and the sound of the explosion shook the ground, greatly alarming nearby residents. Because the area is a Japanese military zone, heavily guarded, the cause of the crash and the extent of the damage were temporarily unknown.</p>
<h3>New Japanese Organization, Japanese Taxpayers' Association</h3>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, after the Japanese failed in the Shanghai Municipal Council elections, the newly formed Japanese Taxpayers' Association will hold a meeting soon to elect 20 standing committee members to discuss the interests of Japanese taxpayers. The association has gathered 100 members to participate in the meeting and elect standing committee members from among them. The chairman of the association is currently concurrently the chairman of the Japanese Residents' Association, and the association's address is also located within the association.</p>
<h3>Strict Security Measures to Ensure Concession Security</h3>
<p>The ordinary security measures adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Police are being continued to ensure the security within the concession in light of the frequent robbery cases in recent days. The barbed wire frameworks set up at various key intersections have not yet been completely removed. Chinese and Western detectives stationed on both sides are selectively checking suspicious pedestrians. These ordinary security measures will now be extended to maintain security and order within the district.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Changes Direction, Threatens Coastal Fujian and Guangdong</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Zikawei Observatory yesterday morning, the direction of the Pacific hurricane has changed from northwest to west-northwest, so the threat to Shanghai has gradually decreased. According to the observatory's report at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, the hurricane had reached 19 degrees north latitude and 122 degrees east longitude. The center of the storm was within a radius of 60 nautical miles, heading west-northwest. According to the reported position, the hurricane has reached the north side of Luzon. If it continues in a west-northwest direction, it will clearly threaten the coast of Fujian and Guangdong. Another Pacific hurricane, after appearing to stall, has ceased to be reported on, suggesting that it may have dissipated.</p>
<h3>Zhang Hanyuan Shot in Front of the Continental Swimming Pool, Bullet Pierces Back, Life in Danger</h3>
<p>Zhang Hanyuan, a 28-year-old native of Zhejiang residing on Avenue Joffre, was walking east on Jing'an Temple Road in front of the Continental Swimming Pool last night at 9:30 PM, wearing a light gray suit, when two men suddenly followed behind Zhang and fired a shot at Zhang's back. The bullet entered his back and exited through his left chest. He fainted and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The shooter, seeing that his goal had been achieved, escaped into the crowd and disappeared. Chinese policeman No. 1014 nearby heard the sound and rushed to the scene, immediately summoning an ambulance to take him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, where he was placed in room 307. His injuries are severe, and his life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Dreadful Indian Summer, Citizens Need to Take Precautions</h3>
<p>In recent days, the new autumn heat has been unusually severe, and the weather is abnormal, making all kinds of seasonal ailments easily spread. The Indian summer is again baring its fangs and claws, wreaking havoc on the human world. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department: the number of deaths in the previous week totaled 884, breaking the highest death record of the year, with dysentery, typhoid fever, and measles being the most prevalent. According to local news, cholera is gradually becoming epidemic, with a mortality rate of about 15%. This shows that the situation is quite serious. Citizens, fearing the plague, are buying various effective preventive medicines to prepare for the worst. Among them, the most popular is Lee Chung Seng Tong's Bao Ji Pills. Because this Bao Ji Pills is a well-known old-brand medicine in China and abroad, it has the most effective ability to treat and prevent diseases. It is effective for vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, epidemics, cholera, various dysenteries, and other Yangwei diseases. Moreover, the medicine is pure and mild, and it is easy to take. Therefore, people from all walks of life are happy to purchase and prepare Bao Ji Pills, and they all believe that it is the most effective way to prevent the Indian summer.</p>
<h3>Resumption of Foreign Ships on Shanghai-Fujian Line, No Hope in the Near Future, Moufu Wheel Resailing to Gu'aotou Has Been Abandoned, Lighter Tonnage Vessels Are Still Planned to Try Sailing Again</h3>
<p>After the Japanese army announced the blockade of the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, Songmen and Gu'aotou in Zhejiang Province, and Sanjiangkou in Fujian, were not included in the blockade, so customs clearance was carried out as usual. However, ships sailing to the above three places were all subjected to inspection and ordered to return. As a result, the ships Shenyou, Shenhua, Xin'anna, and Yongfeng, which had previously sailed to Sanjiangkou, did not reach their destinations and were forced to return. The Shenhua Wheel also encountered a robbery, resulting in huge losses. The ships Hana, Moufu, and Yongtai, which sailed to Gu'aotou, were also obstructed and have returned to Shanghai. It is also rumored that the Moufu Wheel planned to try sailing again, but it is reported that the company has abandoned the plan and is unloading the goods onto the wharf.</p>
<p>Changde Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Changde Wheel sailed from Shanghai to Gu'aotou with cargo on the 7th of this month. It was repeatedly searched by Japanese warships along the way and accidentally entered the Japanese naval cordon line and was detained for a time. After the shipowner tried his best to explain to the Japanese navy, he was released. After many twists and turns, he left Aojiang on the morning of the 10th. It took a whole week to unload the cargo. Because Japanese planes bombed continuously for days, the wharves along the river were slightly damaged, and most of the workers fled. There was nothing to do during the day, and a little work was done in the evening, so it was very fortunate that the cargo could be unloaded. Loading the return cargo was even more difficult and had to be returned to Shanghai empty. He arrived in port yesterday afternoon and stopped briefly at Pier 3, The Bund, Wuma Road, before sailing to the opposite bank of Dongjiadu on the Huangpu River to moor. The British-owned Yonghua Wheel sailed to Gu'aotou a few days ago and was able to enter the port. However, because the workers had fled completely, it was impossible to unload the cargo, so it had to return to Shanghai. It has arrived in port yesterday and is now unloading the goods onto the wharf. After the goods are unloaded, it will sail to the waterfront of Nanshi to moor. It is feared that there is no hope of resuming sailing in the near future.</p>
<p>Trying to Sail to Songmen</p>
<p>Although the German Roulin Foreign Company's Gaodeng Wheel plans to resume sailing to Songmen, Nantian, Jinqing Port, and 溪, it is difficult to determine whether it can be implemented. Yesterday evening, two small vessels flying the flags of the constitutional government, both with a tonnage of less than 50 tons, sailed to Songmen. These two small vessels do not have radio equipment, so it will be impossible to know the situation on the sea. A report will only be available after they reach their destination.</p>
<p>Shenhua Passengers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fujian Fellow Villagers Association, which organized the Shenhua Wheel Robbery Relief Committee, sent representatives to the Yilong Company yesterday morning to negotiate compensation for the losses. However, no concrete results have been obtained. It is reported that the company has agreed in principle to allocate funds to relieve the victims. The details of the negotiations will be announced in detail after the Relief Committee holds its second meeting at 9:00 AM this morning. According to news from the Luodun Company, a Fujianese merchant in Shanghai, the Fujianese passengers whose drafts were robbed received a telegram from Fujian yesterday morning stating that the drafts had not been cashed, which was a great comfort to the losers.</p>
<p>Japanese Shipwrecked</p>
<p>The Japanese ship Chen Li Maru of the Huadong Shipping Bureau, which sails on the Shanghai-Dinghai line to Putuoshan and other ports, was loading passengers and cargo in Shanghai and sailing to Dinghai when it was suddenly hit by a hurricane outside Wusongkou. The hurricane was extremely violent, and the ship could not be steered and drifted with the wind before running aground on a reef outside Wusongkou. Although the entire crew of the ship tried to rescue it, it was to no avail. The hull of the ship was severely damaged, and seawater poured in. More than 100 passengers on board were terrified when they saw that the ship had been shipwrecked and cried for help before jumping onto a nearby shallow beach sailboat to escape. However, they were all badly frightened and suffered many losses of luggage. More than 1,000 pieces of cloth, cigarettes, paper, groceries, and other items were washed away, resulting in huge losses. The ship has now drifted to the beach opposite the Nanhui levee west of Tongsha. The hull of the ship is damaged in many places and cannot be driven to Shanghai for the time being.</p>
<h3>Issuance Dates for Two National Defense and Construction Bonds, Second Instalment</h3>
<p>In order to enrich military supplies and raise funds for construction projects, the National Government is issuing 1.2 billion Chinese yuan of National Defense Bonds and 10 million British pounds and 50 million U.S. dollars of Construction Bonds. Each will be issued in two instalments. The first National Defense instalment was issued on March 1st, and the second instalment will be issued on September 1st at 94 on the par.

<h3>Sharp Decline in Dance Hall Visitors, Reduced Donation Revenue, Decrease of About 30,000 Dancers</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has been abnormally hot, even more so than in the intense heat, and there has been a drought without rain, resulting in the spread of infectious diseases. Amusement venues have also seen a sharp decline in business due to this reason. In order to raise funds for the refugee factory, the Dance Hall Group of the Refugee Relief Association Negotiating Committee reached an agreement with each dance hall at the beginning of its establishment. Those with dance tickets of five yuan or more were classified as Grade A dance halls, and each dancer entering or leaving was charged a refugee donation of 10 cents. Those with dance tickets of less than five yuan were charged a refugee donation of 5 cents per dancer entering or leaving. This has been in effect for 17 months. Now, due to the hot weather, the business of each dance hall has greatly decreased. In the past ten months or so, the monthly donation revenue of the dance halls has been around 11,000 yuan, with Grade A dance halls accounting for more than 8,000 yuan (i.e., more than 80,000 dancers per month) and Grade B dance halls accounting for more than 3,000 yuan (i.e., more than 60,000 dancers). However, in July, due to rising prices, poor market conditions, and hot weather, the revenue was only 9,617.55 yuan, with Grade A dance halls accounting for more than 6,000 yuan (more than 60,000 dancers) and Grade B dance halls accounting for more than 2,000 yuan (40 to 50,000 dancers). June was 10,057.40 yuan, which is about 1,000 yuan less than the average of previous months, and the number of visitors has also decreased proportionally by about 30,000 people.</p>
<h3>Eastern Zhejiang Mail Has Not Arrived</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration has received a notice from Zhejiang Libuhuo that more than 1,000 bags of mail from eastern Zhejiang will arrive in Shanghai. However, they have not arrived as of today. It has been found that no batch of mail between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been received since the interruption on the 16th of last month. Therefore, people from Zhejiang in Shanghai feel very depressed and hope that the post office will find a way to open the postal route and increase the speed of delivery.</p>
<h3>Chen Yanlin Kidnapping Case Planned - Three Captured Bandits All Suffered Gunshot Wounds - Sent to Hospital for Treatment, Interrogation After Recovery</h3>
<p>Chen Yanlin, owner of Yecheng Industrial Company located at No. 9, Jinfuli, 389 Hankou Road, was suddenly attacked by four kidnappers at 11:00 AM on the 18th. One person stood guard outside the door, while three entered the manager's office. Upon seeing Chen, two of them took out Mauser pistols to intimidate him, then handcuffed Chen's hands and forcibly dragged him out. Chen, at the time, did his utmost to struggle and</p>
<p>shouted for help.</p>
<p>Seeing things were not going well, the three kidnappers immediately used the butt of a Mauser pistol to strike Chen's head violently, causing him to bleed, in an attempt to stop him from shouting. However, Chen continued to shout. As the bandits dragged Chen out the door, they fired two shots, one bullet hitting Chen's right shoulder. At that moment, a Western constable, No. 280 of the Central Police Station, and a Chinese constable were patrolling nearby and, hearing the commotion, rushed to the scene. Seeing the situation, they opened fire, resulting in all three kidnappers being shot in their hands and legs. Consequently, they abandoned their hostage and</p>
<p>scattered and fled.</p>
<p>One of the bandits, named Wang Chengqiong (also known as Rui Tong, 20 years old, from Jiangbei), fled into the back door of the Huadong Shoe Store at No. 13, Shanxi Road, where he was apprehended by the Western constable. His leg had already sustained a gunshot wound. A Mauser pistol and 18 bullets were confiscated. Another bandit, Zhang Guilin (28 years old, from Jiangbei), sustained a gunshot wound to each leg and continued to flee, injured, to Fuzhou Road. There, a Ruifeng Transportation Company coal truck, No. 23632, was passing by. Zhang fired two shots to</p>
<p>stop the vehicle.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Constable No. 1582 was on board escorting the truck. Zhang immediately pointed the Mauser pistol at the constable to intimidate him, then snatched the constable's official pistol and jumped off the truck, fleeing rapidly. He entered through the front door of a certain hotel and exited through the back door, turning into the alley of the Wugong Hotel and running out, entering No. 140, Fujian Road. At this time, a Chinese constable from the Third Patrol Division, No. 172, was passing by. Seeing that Zhang had fresh blood on both legs, he knew he was no good and</p>
<p>drew his gun to stop</p>
<p>his movements. Zhang, exhausted and unable to resist, immediately threw the Mauser pistol he was holding, along with 28 bullets, on the ground. The constable apprehended him and also confiscated the pistol snatched from Constable No. 1582. Another bandit, Xu Baocheng (34 years old, also known as Lao Chen, from Jiangbei), sustained a gunshot wound to his arm. After escaping to the Hongmiao intersection on Nanjing Road, he hired a rickshaw. When the rickshaw reached the Zhifu Road intersection, it was spotted by Chinese Constable No. 3289, who, seeing Chen</p>
<p>covered in blood,</p>
<p>stopped him and asked what had happened. Xu replied that he had just been in a fight and was injured. The constable, considering the injury case to be a criminal matter, took him to the police station, where it was discovered that he was also one of the kidnappers. After investigation by Chinese detectives Li Pengfei and Xu Fusheng, the three criminals and Chen Yanlin were sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, the police station's lawyer, Ru Bao-yi, petitioned the First Special Court to approve the temporary detention of the three criminals. Judge Xiao then ordered the detention, pending further interrogation after the criminals recovered from their injuries.</p>
<h3>Robert Road Shooting - Wang Xingjin Shot Dead by Friend</h3>
<p>Wang Xingjin, residing at No. 9, Fugui Lane, Robert Road, was visited by Cao Zhenpeng, an acquaintance, around 9:00 AM yesterday. Cao pretended to invite Wang to discuss a matter. Wang, suspecting nothing, followed him to the front of the Jin Yi Glass Factory nearby. Unexpectedly, Cao pulled out a pistol and fired two shots at him, one hitting his left shoulder and the other hitting his ribs. The wounds were very serious, and Wang collapsed to the ground. Seeing that his objective had been achieved, the killer immediately fled without a trace. People summoned an ambulance, which rushed him to Luren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died.</p>
<h3>Fire at US Military Barracks - Huge Losses - Worth Over US$5,000</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", a fire broke out in the material storage room of the US Marine Corps Fourth Regiment barracks near Gordon Road, Xinzha Road, at 2:35 PM last Saturday. The value of the materials destroyed was estimated at US$5,000 to US$7,000, equivalent to approximately 125,000 legal tender. The destroyed materials included a large amount of paint, wood cutting machines, and timber. Fire brigades from Xinzha and Jing'an Temple responded to the alarm and dispatched vehicles to extinguish the fire, which was brought under control around 4:00 PM. A wooden shed used by the motor transport team within the barracks was also completely destroyed, and two trees were scorched.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Overseas Chinese's Son - Defendant Found Not Guilty - Bail Granted During Appeal Period</h3>
<p>Yang Litai, a 15-year-old Fujianese and son of an overseas Chinese resident at No. 804, Pu Shi Road, was kidnapped on June 8th at noon on his way home from Gubal Primary School on Gubal Road. The vehicle was passing the intersection of Gubal Road and Pu Shi Road when he was suddenly abducted by kidnappers. Yang's mother reported the incident to the police station based on information received. Investigations revealed that a relative of the Yang family, Shi Guozhen, was involved, and he was arrested. He confessed. Based on his confession, Dong Xiaowuzi, Zheng Rusong, Lin Shuangquan, and Chen Wangshi, wife of the driver Chen Er who drove the car during the kidnapping, were also apprehended. During interrogation at the police station, Dong, fearing punishment, violently struck his head against the wall and died from his injuries. The hostage was rescued by the French police on July 6th in a thatched house on Daxi Road, and four kidnappers were captured. As it was not within the jurisdiction of that police station, they were taken away by the "Shanghai Municipal Police Department". The police station handed the four defendants over to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. As Chen Wangshi was deemed uninvolved, she was not prosecuted. The others were prosecuted on charges of kidnapping for ransom. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao concluded the trial and ruled: "Judgement" Shi Guozhen, Zheng Rusong, and Lin Shuangquan are all found not guilty. During the appeal period, the three defendants were each granted bail of one thousand yuan. Without bail, they will remain in custody.</p>
<h3>Chengxing Lane - Water Bill Dispute</h3>
<p>A water bill dispute has erupted in Chengxing Lane, May-er-bai-ge Road. Water has been cut off to several households at Nos. 27, 29, and 33. The remaining households have been granted an extension until the 22nd of this month. With the deadline fast approaching, tenant representatives petitioned the Public Works Department, the Fire Department, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the International Settlement, the Citizens' Federation, and the Xinzha Police Station, one after another, yesterday afternoon. They argued that if the water supply were cut off, the diet and hygiene of the thousands of residents in the entire lane would face a severe crisis. Furthermore, it is now the height of summer, and if a fire were to break out due to negligence, it would inevitably spread rapidly. If this were to happen late at night, the consequences would be unbearable. They were compelled to submit a petition, earnestly requesting that the authorities grant protection and instruct the landlords to consider the hardship faced by ordinary people and the safety of social order, and not to demolish the premises without legal resolution, in order to avoid further disputes. This would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h3>Two Carjacking Cases Occurred Yesterday Morning - Xiang Sheng Car Later Intercepted on Yuyuan Road</h3>
<p>Two carjacking cases occurred within the Public Settlement yesterday morning between 8:40 AM and 9:05 AM. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Yi Tai)</p>
<p>At 8:40 AM yesterday morning, two passengers dressed in Western suits suddenly came to the Yi Tai Automobile Company at No. 188, Hubei Road, to hire a car. The accounting office dispatched driver Li A-lin (36 years old, from Haimen, driver number 9000) to drive car number 17711. After the passengers got into the car, they asked to be driven to the Baoshan Road intersection in Zhabei. When the car arrived there, two more people got on, one dressed in a long gown and the other in a coppersmith's outfit. They then ordered the car to be driven to Baotong Road in the northern part of the city. Upon arriving at a dilapidated house, the four people in the car each produced weapons and forced the driver to get out of the car, declaring "Help me out here." One person took the driver, Li A-lin, into the dilapidated house and detained him until around 11:30 AM, before releasing him and telling him that he could find the car himself in the Hongqiao area of western Shanghai. The car was discovered at the Wujiaochang in western Shanghai at 2:20 PM in the afternoon, and the company dispatched Constable No. 2027 to retrieve it. The purpose of carjacking is still under investigation.</p>
<p>(Xiang Sheng)</p>
<p>Around 9:05 AM yesterday morning, two customers suddenly arrived at the Xiang Sheng Automobile branch station on Jiaozhou Road, Yuyuan Road, in western Shanghai. Driver Qian A-liang drove car number 18562 to the intersection of Jessfield Road and Dihua Road. Four more people got on, one of whom was holding a pistol. They instructed the driver to go to the French area's Fahua Town on Columbia Road, ordering the car to stop. Two people jumped out and forcibly dragged the driver, Qian A-liang, out of the car, took off the driver's uniform and had one of the bandits put it on, then drove the car away. They dragged Qian A-liang into a thatched hut and held him captive for about half an hour before releasing him. He then reported the carjacking to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station. The police station issued an emergency order, notifying all street constables to pay close attention to the vehicle. Before long, the car was intercepted by a constable on duty on Yuyuan Road, and the people and the car were taken to the police station for strict interrogation. According to the bandit, who identified himself as Pan Changsheng, the car was hijacked to kidnap Zhong Caiqing, the manager of the De'erke Lamp Factory at No. 40, Lane 876, Gordon Road. The police are currently searching for the remaining fugitives.</p>

<p>Research on the Duration of Affection Between Spouses</p>
<p>This is a very serious question. There are many couples who married out of love, and were so affectionate during their honeymoon period. But how long does it last? They fall out with each other. Either the man seeks a mistress outside the home, or the woman secretly engages in clandestine affairs, or even sues for divorce. As the saying goes: "Newlyweds are fragrant for three years, after three years they are a stinky latrine." This vividly describes the human tendency to be fond of the new and tired of the old.</p>
<p>Looking at it from another perspective, clothes are better the newer they are, but people are better the older they are. There are many young couples living together and elderly couples who grow old together in the world. Don't elderly couples who have been married for decades often celebrate silver or gold wedding anniversaries? This brings family harmony, a house full of children and grandchildren, and friends gathered together, raising their glasses in joyful celebration. How pleasant and happy! Multiple blessings, long life, and many sons are what Chinese society has always praised. So why doesn't the love between spouses last forever, but is only fleeting?</p>
<p>Let's be frank. A couple is the union of two sexes, and their love is entirely built on the foundation of "unity of soul and body." If couples pay attention to sexual hygiene after marriage and maintain the permanent health of their sexual function, then if they married out of love, their love will surely last forever, without end. If it is a marriage arranged by matchmakers, their love will grow stronger, and their passionate affection will be even greater in the future after marriage. In short, if a healthy and beautiful couple can maintain their sexual health and use their wisdom to create romance, their love will not waver unless there are special environmental temptations. If a man has engaged in masturbation or nocturnal emissions in his youth, or has suffered from excessive indulgence, overwork, or new injuries after marriage, resulting in spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, neurasthenia, infertility, incomplete development, or dissipation of energy, then no matter how compatible their wills are or how comfortable their lives and environment are, love that is only spiritual cannot last long. Their love will inevitably fade day by day, leading to sleeping in the same bed with different dreams, and various tragedies in the family! A smart husband who wants to restore love and rekindle the good times should cure his illness at its root. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" is the most effective and targeted treatment. This preparation can generate sperm and invigorate the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation, and nourish nerves within one day and night after taking it. Continued use will completely cure the above symptoms in a short period, and can also achieve the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Ximituo's Solid Essence Tablets" to strengthen the essence gate and stop the leakage, which will yield faster results. However, if patients can come to this clinic for diagnosis by expert doctors, and then undergo various targeted therapies such as ionization therapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>Breasts are the Source of a Woman's Happiness</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, MD, USA</p>
<p>I'd rather be mandarin ducks than immortals. Spend the golden years in sweet love. If illness causes the breasts to shrink, science can remedy it without delay!</p>
<p>In today's trend, to be a modern woman and be called "beautiful", one must pay attention to the health of the body, and especially to the development of the breasts! Because when men look at women today, they don't look at their head or feet. Their lightning-like eyes are only directed at your chest. If they see your breasts rising and falling high when you move, showing a proud posture, then even if your face is less attractive, they won't mind at all. Conversely, if your breasts are like deflated balls, loose and shriveled, then even if your face looks like Lin Daiyu or Zhao Feiyan, you won't be able to win their favor, and they may even make sarcastic remarks! As for women who consider themselves smart, they don't hesitate to pass off fish eyes as pearls by wearing bras. But when the curtain of the boudoir comedy rises, their efforts are still in vain, and their true form is revealed. As a result, they are ashamed, and the men are disgusted! Feelings break down, and tragedy occurs!</p>
<p>So why do women's breasts shrivel? According to the experience of world-renowned gynecologist Kandeaning and others, this is due to masturbation, tight clothing, menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, and postpartum weakness, which damage the function of the ovaries. The only way to remedy this is to actively take the ovarian preparation for women, "Sheng Zhi Su", which is the most effective and targeted treatment. This preparation is well-formulated, and can nourish ovarian function, boost metabolism, adjust menstruation, and warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea within one day and night after taking it. Continued use will not only make shriveled breasts become high and erect, but also make a haggard face become plump and rosy, exuding a fresh radiance from the muscles, charming and moving.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Nocturnal Emission and Brain Weakness and Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>In this bustling city, in the long days and short nights of summer, insomnia is the most painful thing. Because working all day is already very tiring, and the blood is full of fatigue toxins, yet one tosses and turns at night and cannot sleep soundly, listening to the clock ticking away, and then has to return to labor again at dawn. How miserable is this! One's health will inevitably decline day by day, and eventually become incurable!</p>
<p>Although there are many causes of insomnia, young people who are just beginning to experience spring feelings often develop bad habits of masturbation due to ignorance and curiosity. After masturbating for a long time, the nerves are destroyed, and their effectiveness is often weakened or even lost. Therefore, the essence gate cannot be controlled, and nocturnal emission follows. Once nocturnal emission starts, and is not treated for a long time, the brain, spinal cord, and sexual nerves are severely damaged. Therefore, symptoms such as brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, excessive dreaming, aversion to worries, decline of ambition, lower back pain, kidney deficiency, dissipation of energy, and incomplete development follow. Such men are dazed all day long, as if they are sleeping but not sleeping, as if they are drunk but not drunk. Not only do they achieve nothing in their careers and studies, but they also cannot have a happy married life, and are hated by their wives! They may even become prematurely senile and die young, wasting their lives! The only way to remedy this, according to the experience of world-renowned doctors and my own, is to take "Ximituo's Solid Essence Tablets" to strengthen the essence gate and calm the nerves. This not only provides a good night's sleep, but also cures nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above symptoms, one must also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase essence and blood, and nourish the nerves. Continued use will completely cure the above symptoms in a short period, and can also achieve the effects of prolonging life and rejuvenating youth.</p>
<h3>Ironclad Facts</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Zhan Nianceng, Specialist in Venereal Diseases</p>
<p>(1) Young Men with Nocturnal Emission Should Not Delay and Mislead Themselves</p>
<p>Mr. Qiao Rongzu, 30 years old, from Ningbo, came to Shanghai last year to stay in a middle school in this city because his hometown was often bombed. However, the environment in Shanghai was too licentious, and the school lacked good training facilities. Boarding students could often go out for leisure. Once, he was pulled away by a prostitute, and because of lustful thoughts, he committed masturbation. He didn't know that once masturbation is committed, it is easy to become an addiction, leading to relaxation of the essence gate and the outbreak of nocturnal emission. At first, it was only two or three times a month, but then it gradually increased to five or six times, or even ten times. As a result, his face became sallow and thin, his memory deteriorated, he suffered from dizziness and headaches, tinnitus, blurred vision, fatigue in his limbs, and lower back pain. His schoolwork also plummeted. At this point, Mr. Qiao realized the harm of masturbation and nocturnal emission, but repeatedly taking over-the-counter medicines on the market had little effect. He came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment at the beginning of last month, determined to cure his disease. After the expert doctor carefully examined his symptoms, he knew that it was indeed caused by the mistreatment of nocturnal emission, so he instructed him to go to the Zhongxi Pharmacy to purchase two boxes of the special medicine for nocturnal emission "Ximituo's Solid Essence Tablets" and two dozens of the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" to take together, and also intermittently use "Diemen's" electrotherapy. After three weeks of careful treatment, he is now full of energy, his mind is clear, and the above symptoms have completely disappeared.</p>
<p>(2) The Husband's Sorrow After Marriage</p>
<p>Mr. Gao Ming, 26 years old, married last winter. The couple has never been able to get along harmoniously because Mr. Gao discovered impotence after marriage, and also had slight nocturnal emission. The couple's relationship is extremely bad. Mr. Gao's inner pain can hardly be described in words. Although he had taken so-called "kidney-tonifying and essence-producing endocrine agents" on the market, they had little effect, and he felt even more depressed! Last month, introduced by his friend (Mr. Gu, who had also been cured of his hidden illness in this clinic), he came to this clinic for diagnosis and treatment. After examining his condition, he instructed him to purchase three dozens of the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Sheng Zhi Su" and one box of "Ximituo's Solid Essence Tablets" to take together, and also administer new medical techniques such as electrotherapy and injections every day. One month has passed, and now he is full of energy and strength, and the couple's love is infinitely entwined.</p>

<h3>Financial News: Foreign Exchange Constrained by Rumors, Chinese Merchants Compete to Purchase Foreign Exchange, Prices Tighten Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. In the unofficial market for British and American exchange rates, prices fluctuated and tightened, which was due to British and American banks suddenly absorbing large amounts of cheap currency. The pound in New York continued to decline slightly by two points in the morning, but was unaffected. When Chinese merchants and Hong Kong telegram operators saw that American banks intended to sell, they also came to compete for US dollars, so the US dollar was strongest, and could be settled at 5.6875 yuan. HSBC and Citibank suddenly absorbed strongly, and British firm Sassoon continued to buy. The Asian Petroleum Company had a long-term British gold settlement, so it leveled off at noon, and British gold softened to 3 pence 703125. In the afternoon, there were even urgent reports from Haiphong, Vietnam, and rumors of a second meeting of the city's defense forces. The intention of oil and foreign firms to settle was not diminished, and foreign rice settlements also rose. Chinese merchants such as Shengda competed to purchase US dollars for the current month, and the lowest settlement was only 5.3125 yuan. Although it rebounded slightly at the end, it was calculated at 5.5625 yuan, which was still tightened by 0.0625. British gold was tightened by 0.03125, to 3 pence 6875. The trading volume for the whole day was quite high.</p>
<p>Asia Petroleum Settles Long-Term Contracts</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the exchange rate was unchanged between British and US dollars, and flat against Shanghai. The US dollar was down two points against the British dollar, and down one corner and one point against Shanghai. There was no market for French currency. The listed exchange rates of the Central Bank remained the same. Banks opened with spot selling prices in the morning: British gold at 3 pence 71875, US exchange at 5.625 yuan. Compared with the closing price on Saturday, British and American banks also intended to supply, and speculators followed suit, so the market eased. The foreign banks' purchase price for US exchange in August was 5.65625 yuan. Chinese merchants and speculators dumped US exchange with foreign banks for 5.59375 and 6875 yuan for September. HSBC's listed prices did not change at all. The silver balance tax was announced, with no increase or decrease. Afterwards, Chinese merchants and speculators continued to release, and HSBC American Bank had the appetite to eat. Although the initial purchase price for US exchange in August was 5.6875 yuan, the downtrend stabilized slightly, so soon Chinese banks, East Asia, and foreign banks and speculators mutually sold the same month's US exchange to Sassoon, returning to 5.65625 yuan, and 5.59375 yuan for September. Asia Petroleum also bought US exchange for October at an opening price of 5.5625 yuan. Until before closing, HSBC still had the intention to buy, and the market trend was unstable. As a result, British gold was 3 pence 703125, and US exchange was 5.625 yuan, which was tighter by 0.015625 than the morning opening for British, and unchanged for US.</p>
<p>The Aftermarket Only Has Buyers</p>
<p>The market softened in the afternoon, due to speculators turning to sell. Calculated into foreign banks, August US exchange was 5.59375 yuan, and Shengda American Bank and others September US exchange was 5.5625 yuan. Asia Petroleum continued to accept US exchange for October at a price of 5.5 yuan. At the time, it was rumored that the Japanese army had landed in Haiphong, and people were uneasy, and there was a lack of sellers. British gold closed at 3 pence 6875, and US exchange at 5.5625 yuan. September British gold was 3 pence 65625, and US exchange was 5.53225. Compared with last Saturday's close, British gold was tighter by 0.02125 and 0.046875 for term and spot, respectively, and US exchange was softer by 0.0625 for both term and spot.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Still Stable</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 19th (Monday) Telegram. This morning's exchange market opened and closed. British exchange spot and futures both opened at the original levels.

<h3>Bullish Interest in Cash Gold Declines, Cash Rebounds Sharply, Bills of Exchange Gradually Tighten is the Main Reason</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market, in the unofficial market, was tired but firm, due to the unchanged bullish confidence of buyers, bold absorption of additional amounts, and the tightening trend of foreign exchange. Prices were easily pulled up. The lowest in the early morning was only 5,620 yuan. After banks and gold shops took the opportunity to purchase aggressively, it rose to 5,690 yuan. Money changers mostly supplied. Later, securities firms and a certain gold shop sold, slightly reducing it by 30 to 40 yuan. However, upon hearing that the exchange market was soft, retail investors all entered, and it rose again to 5,680 yuan. The noon close was 5,676 yuan. The buying momentum in the aftermarket was even stronger, as favorable rumors arrived again, reporting that the Japanese army had landed in Haiphong, stimulating a rise. Gold shops and others forcefully pushed it up from the opening of 5,680 yuan to 705 yuan. Although it fell slightly later, the highest actually reached 5,750 yuan, due to large purchases by securities firms. The evening close was also 5,730 yuan, a huge rise of 70 yuan compared to last Saturday's close. The transaction volume for the whole day was still strong, about one thousand taels. Jewelry gold in silver shops ultimately increased by 10 yuan, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Rises Sharply by 70 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), initially had many sellers due to tired sentiment, resulting in a small press of 40 yuan at the opening. Money changers issued 30 taels of silver, for 5,620 yuan. Subsequently, a certain silver shop absorbed madly again and again, and at this time, the gold shop also had a healthy appetite. Although money changers were issuing in the middle, they were ultimately outnumbered. Before long, it rose to 5,690 yuan. Then the gold shop and scattered retailers vomited again, and in addition, securities firms also sold, and it once fell to 5,655 yuan. After this, money changers suddenly came to cover short positions, and the sentiment remained firm. Those who had sold out came to drag in again, so it rose again to 5,680 yuan before closing, and the closing was 5,676 yuan. The market atmosphere was even better in the afternoon. The opening was high by 4 yuan, and silver shops mutually did the upper two, for 5,680 yuan. Subsequently, silver shops and other firms competed to enter, and soon exceeded the 5,700 yuan mark. Silver shops entered 10 taels for gold shops, rising to 5,705 yuan. Later, the securities firm and bullish silver shops vomited out, returning low to 5,693 yuan. Unexpectedly, at this time, there was talk of a reopened meeting of the city's defense forces, and the buying wind rose again. Gold shops and silver shops first came to drag in, rising immediately to 5,720 yuan. After this, there was even more news that Haiphong was tight, and the buying wind became stronger. Around 3:00 PM, a high price of 5,750 yuan was seen. Afterwards, due to excessive floating profits coming out of the market, it fell back by 20 yuan. Gold shops issued 20 taels for silver shops, retreating to 5,739 yuan. As a result, it rose sharply by 70 yuan compared to the end of last week (after the close, the off-site had initially done 5,720 yuan, but the last 5,730 yuan was still difficult to get used to), with a fluctuation of 130 yuan for the whole day. The selling price of cash gold shop's own brand gold was ten yuan higher than cash gold, and the purchase was thirty yuan lower. The current auction gold was fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Hung High by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops was initially still 580 yuan in major firms. By 3:00 PM in the afternoon, it was hung high by ten yuan, so major firms changed to suspend 590 yuan. The new firms had similar prices, and the purchase price was reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Reduced by Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills of exchange rebounded. The discount for each thousand yuan was as low as 33 yuan in the morning, and the discount for issuance was 35 yuan. In the afternoon, the discount prices were all around 34 yuan, a reduction of two yuan compared to the price on Saturday. The interest rate for money trade association rose by one point. Both the morning and afternoon markets hung at one point four cents, it is said.</p>

<h3>Foreign Currency Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market: Cash gold suddenly rose after falling, and the rising momentum was especially strong in the afternoon, so British and American gold pounds rose as soon as they fell, and ultimately rose by two yuan. The demand for British gold bills was not bad, and the market price rebounded by two corners. Although the US dollar bill had retreated to 17 yuan, 5 corners and 1 point, it immediately stepped up. There were various favorable rumors in the afternoon, so the rising wind was even more intense. The evening market was as high as 17 yuan, 5 corners and 2 corners, which was also a sharp increase of corners and seven points compared to last week. There was a slight demand for Hong Kong tickets, and the market price rose slightly. Japanese gold tickets and Korean tickets were exceptionally strong. The demand from all parties was extraordinarily strong, and the market price surged extraordinarily. The former was as high as 1 yuan, 3 corners and 9 points, and the latter was as high as 1 yuan and 5 points.</p>

<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Firm and Stable, Foreign Stocks Briefly Tired</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities unofficial market fluctuated slightly, but the trend was still very firm and charming. The competition between the long and short sides was very fierce, but the long side still had the advantage. For example, Lianhe, Tongkang, and Lianyi were sold very enthusiastically, but the long side did not feel pressured. In fact, the circulating chips in the market have been collected and closed by various factions, and the chips in the market are increasingly lacking. Judging from the difficulty of borrowing goods among peers, it is not easy for the short side to raise its head. Yesterday morning, Lianhe sold bravely, followed by Lianyi and Lemao. The market atmosphere seemed to be weak, but as Tongxing's appetite for intake was extremely strong, and Chongsou purchased the Bing and Ding Reds very powerfully, this was another group of collectors closing in. The surface situation suddenly turned firm. In the afternoon, Lianhe suddenly covered short positions, and Chongsou added to the long positions. No. 7 and No. 38 specialized in collecting Category B, and the market situation suddenly improved again. Tongkang and Lianyi were still unable to supply enough, and the market price rose again, so as a result, it still rose by five points one corner to two corners and a half. The total number of transactions was about 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category	Highest	Lowest	Closing	Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A	60.45	60.30	60.45	Up 0.05</p>
<p>Unified B	53.70	53.30	53.60	Up 0.25</p>
<p>Unified C	50.70	50.45	50.65	Up 0.15</p>
<p>Unified D	49.85	49.75	49.80	Flat</p>
<p>Unified E	50.25	50.15	50.25	Up 0.05</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company were traded, at a price of 41.5 yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market of various industries was exceptionally firm and stable, and the stock prices of Zhizhi Enterprise, Wheelock Marden, and others all rose. In the afternoon, due to rumors that the工部局 would hold a temporary emergency meeting, selling was triggered in Beijing. The multiple maintaining party was also powerful, so as a result, the prices of various stocks only fell slightly from their highest points.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Customer Sales Still Fragmented as Before, Long Positions in Cotton Changjiang Still Active</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially tired and then rose, but the trend is still in a fickle and constant state. However, current yarn sales, although the transportation routes between Yunnan and Hong Kong have been interrupted, the sporadic purchases of this group continue unabated, so a portion of the people's hearts still tend towards the bullish side. Another saying is that Shenxin No. 9 Factory used to urge customers to ship goods, and now multiple parties have already transferred 4,000 bales to other warehouses, and the warehouse receipts are still not being released, so the large accounts have slightly increased, and the market attitude has been resurrected.</p>
<p>The opening of current yarn in the morning: the atmosphere in the market was sluggish, and most were still on the short side, so the opening price of 20-count Double Horse fell below the 900 yuan mark, to 895 yuan, falling slightly to 891 yuan. Subsequently, upon hearing that the scattered demand in Yunnan and Hong Kong continued, the buying side became active again, and the market price gradually rose. Finally, the multiple parties made some efforts, and the buying momentum suddenly became strong. 40-count Double Horse rose to 955 yuan, and rose another 8 to 9 yuan after closing. Today, 140 pieces of yarn are being transported to Yantai. The amount purchased by various groups is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Peers 1,970	Jiangxi	20</p>
<p>Hong Kong	610	Inland	40</p>
<p>Yunnan	440	Statistics 3,085</p>
<p>Xiamen	5</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Mediocrity, Actual Transactions Quiet</h3>
<p>Current cotton trading is exceptionally quiet, with all parties adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Furthermore, there is no great hope for excitement in the yarn market, due to the increasing stock of yarn. In addition, there is good news regarding this year's domestic new cotton crop, so people's hearts are calm, and the market is lackluster.</p>
<p>Another report on foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market is quiet, due to the settlement of hedges by Southern traders and the closing of positions by some bulls. As a result, closing prices fell by three to four points compared to the previous day. The Indian market is stable, with yesterday's conditions and forecasts showing little fluctuation.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: yesterday, due to the stability of yarn prices, people's sentiment improved. Although cotton trading was quiet, industry players' minds were surprisingly firm, mainly because current inventory levels in the market are not abundant. Japanese merchants still purchased a few hundred bales of Indian cotton for forward delivery on silver terms.</p>
<h3>Food: Imported Rice Sluggish</h3>
<p>Imported rice, which had been trending downwards since the week before, still felt weak yesterday after the holiday reopening. Although early market brokers tried hard to support prices, the general practical sales from inland traders and local shops remained cautious, making the market mediocre. Later, speculators and smallholders were also listless in their transactions. For example, mid-grade goods were experiencing strong supply but sluggish sales, and even though they were holding steady, they gradually saw a decline of three to five cents from downstream. Only at the midday market did those in need take advantage of the lower prices and become active, settling the market situation. By the afternoon, selling pressure intensified, and because standard rice was already scheduled to open today, the local market became even more sluggish, and the market could not support itself and declined. As a result, it fell by another five, six, or seven cents compared to last Saturday. Reimported original packages were also heavily offered, but both practical buyers and speculators lacked interest in buying, so sales did not open. The total transaction volume of imported rice for the entire day was only a little over three thousand bags.</p>
<p>Glutinous rice arrivals are cut off, but due to the market's need to clear inventory for early autumn, the market price continued to soften, falling by about half a yuan. Opening prices were 60.05 to 61 yuan for Jinxi Liyang white rice, 57 to 58 yuan for Changzhou white rice, 57 to 57.5 yuan for Hong Kong white rice, 54 to 55 yuan for sub-grade rice, and 52 yuan for broken rice.</p>
<p>Domestic rice such as thick and thin japonica rice has also been scarce recently. Only a little over a thousand bags arrived in the past two days. It is rumored that off-market trading is weak and prices are trending downwards. Opening prices were 65.5 to 66 yuan for Changbang clear japonica rice, 64 to 64.5 yuan for Wuxi japonica rice, 63 to 64 yuan for Changzhou Sukun japonica rice, about 60 yuan for sub-grade rice, 60 yuan for Suxi thin rice, 61 to 62 yuan for original package early rice from Nangang, and 58 to 59 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Zhoupu new japonica rice has been on the market for a while, and its supply is gradually increasing, reaching no less than a hundred dan. However, due to scattered deliveries and the influence of other goods, the market is changing and showing signs of weakness. Opening prices were 60 to 61 yuan, a drop of one yuan compared to the week before.</p>
<p>More imported rice arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carried by the Yisheng wheel of Jardine Matheson, shipping 996 bags from Hong Kong. It arrived at the port and docked at Roosevelt Wharf yesterday morning to unload. (Ancestor)</p>
<h3>Japanese Flour Most Active</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of supply of flour from Chinese factories, Japanese flour is leading the way, with total sales of nearly 20,000 bags of Phoenix brand. At the opening of the morning session, prices were still weak due to the slight unloading by traders and speculators. However, as customer sales picked up, the market turned firm. This month's price rose from 14.60 yuan to 14.65 yuan, September's price was 14.80 yuan, and October's price was 14.95 yuan. The price of inland flour remained at 14.50 to 14.60 yuan. There was no change in the prices of the Second Flour Factory. It is heard that although the Fuxin Factory has not started production, it is still selling some remaining goods.</p>
<p>Wheat was still considered firm yesterday. It was found that arrivals had increased slightly in the past two days. In addition to Japanese merchants transporting it to the port, Chinese merchants also had scattered arrivals of two to three thousand bags. Because French overstocking was too vigorous, although Japanese factories have good demand, they are unwilling to release goods repeatedly. It is heard that Sanxin Factory in the Pudong market purchased a ship of wheat for 11.45 yuan, while Chinese factories bid up to 13 yuan, and eventually the business was transacted smoothly.</p>
<p>Today, 26,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin. This flour is No. 4 flour from the Fuxin Factory and will be transported by the Xixiangtai wheel today. (Ancestor)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News: Safe Deposit Boxes Are Being Sold At Premium Prices—There Are Rumors of a Crackdown by the Banking Industry</h3>
<p>Recently, it has been discovered that in advertisements for the sale of safe deposit boxes, the safe deposit boxes with annual rental fees of 8 to 12 yuan are being sold for premium prices ranging from 100 to 500 yuan. Mr. Ying Yongyu, a staff member of a certain association, believes that this matter is detrimental to the banking business. He suggested to the Banking Association that the transfer of safe deposit boxes and the replacement of seals should not be allowed, and that the public should be notified not to be fooled. The association believes that this kind of suggestion is beneficial to both banks and general tenants, so it has forwarded a letter to each bank for adoption and implementation. It is heard that each bank that rents out safe deposit boxes will publish an announcement, urging people not to be fooled by the sale of premium prices. Those who wish to rent safe deposit boxes can register with each bank first, so that they can rent them when they become available without paying a premium.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Early Winter Cloth Sales Pick Up</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth: the market was stable yesterday. Spot sales in this street and in various regions of North China, Guangdong, and Hong Kong were good. Speculators were watching, with slight inflows and outflows. Market prices were stable, and the goods held by floating holders were slightly cheaper, by one to two and a half cents per piece. In this street, the inland autumn sales are gradually developing, and transactions of thick and thin velveteen, printed velveteen, blue cloth, and serge are increasing daily. Total transactions of spot goods and September futures were over 500 pieces. Guangdong and Hong Kong brokers handled over 200 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. The Zhejiang and Fujian brokers were still facing transportation obstacles and were at a standstill.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth: it started weak and ended firm, mainly because practical sales in this street were quite active. Therefore, at the morning opening, Longtou fine cloth opened at 30.04 yuan, and short sellers immediately came to cover their positions. In the afternoon, it once rose to 31 yuan, and the closing price was 30.085 yuan. Medium-grade brands such as Caiqiu and Yanghe also rose by 2.5 cents per piece. The inventory of fine twill is not abundant, and the price is particularly firm. Sijunzi serge rose by 5 li per yard, and the future market price was 9.075 cents.</p>
<p>Export: 380 pieces of cotton cloth were shipped to Yantai today.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Edible Oil Rises Again by About One Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the oil market started to rise automatically in recent days, and with reports of rising production prices, people's sentiment has become active, and the market is filled with buying interest. "Kick the football" trading has expanded again, and the result is that it has risen by another yuan compared to last weekend. It is estimated that 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were transacted, with a price of 65 yuan. In addition, 2,000 pieces of road goods were ordered for delivery in the first half of September, also at a price of 65 yuan. 100 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, priced at 93.5 yuan. 500 cans of Yantai raw oil, priced at 94 yuan. 100 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, priced at 70 yuan. 70 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, priced from 70.05 yuan to 71 yuan. 100 barrels of Dayun raw soybean oil, priced at 98 to 99 yuan, and 100 dan of Dayouyu soybean oil, priced at 77 yuan, and the old shop cake was 76 yuan.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: New Honey Dates Gradually Decline</h3>
<p>New honey dates from Jiaxing and Suzhou have continued to arrive recently, and prices are gradually softening. Yesterday, the wholesale price was 145 to 140 yuan plus, with the usual discounts for higher and lower grades. The market was mediocre, with prices about 20 yuan lower than the initial market.</p>
<h3>Coal: Actual Demand for Cooked Coal is Sluggish</h3>
<p>The cooked coal market is as calm as ever, without much excitement. This is because after prices rose, actual demand gradually entered a sluggish phase, and the market price is in a state of hesitation. It is estimated that the price among traders is 160 yuan per ton ex-vehicle, and the cost of delivery to shops in this street for retail is 9 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>Metals: Ribbed Steel Bars, Long Quiet, Consider Moving</h3>
<p>Ribbed steel bars have been quiet for a long time. It is heard that Tianjin traders have recently been purchasing them slightly. Although the construction traders in this street have not fully accepted it, they are also starting to inquire about it. The market atmosphere is gradually showing signs of change. Sentiment among industry players is rising, and the market price is apparently flat but secretly tight. Yesterday's asking price of three to four cents was still 1,150 yuan, and five cents to one inch was 1,100 yuan. However, the off-market price has already shown considerable tightness. Because yesterday was a Sunday, there was no large volume of transactions, but the market trend is already quite promising.</p>
<h3>Statistics: Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Changes in July</h3>
<p>Since the European war situation changed in mid-May, and France was forced to surrender, followed by the stock market crash in New York and the fall of Indian and American cotton, the Shanghai market was affected, and rapid changes occurred, namely the relaxation of the exchange rate and the sharp fall in gold prices. Speculators have been heavily hit, casting a dark shadow over Shanghai's abnormal prosperity. However, misfortunes do not come singly. There have also been changes in the world economy and political situation, such as Hong Kong strengthening its defense work, actively evacuating its population, and the sea defense being temporarily closed. The Yunnan-Vietnam transportation was blocked, and soon the Yunnan-Burma transportation was interrupted for three months. The coastal ports of Zhejiang were also tightened, and shipping was interrupted. Under such circumstances, the trade between the Shanghai market and the mainland is in the process of stagnation. The control of trade with North Buddha has been strengthened since the 26th of June, and the business of various provinces in the north has been hampered. The so-called prosperity of Shanghai is gradually eroding. We only need to see the desolation and idleness of import and export merchants' business, and the few customers in the retail stores, to see a powerful reflection. Therefore, Shanghai's commerce in July has entered a transition from prosperity to recession.</p>
<p>In terms of the changes in Shanghai's commercial industry in July, a total of 165 companies were affected. Analyzing the nature of these changes, the 93 cases of business transfer are the most numerous, followed by the 29 cases of share transfer, and one case each of establishment in preparation and resumption of business. The fact that the number of new openings is less than the number of closures is enough to prove how the trend of industrial and commercial development is. Here, we will further analyze the nature of the changes.</p>
<p>New Openings: There were 17 new openings in July, including 16 domestic businesses and 1 factory. The more important ones include Bingkang Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, China Stock Company, Jinmen Grand Hotel, Tonghui Bank, Zhengfeng Bank, and Yihong Restaurant. The trend of new industrial and commercial openings can be said to be still in abnormal development. However, it is worth noting that the China Stock Company, after the crash of foreign stocks in mid-May, generally awakened speculators, shifted their speculative goals, and tended towards commodity stocks. If it can turn idle funds into legitimate investment, it is a very good phenomenon. The China Stock Company was established at this opportune moment and may be a prelude to guiding idle funds to the path of investment.</p>
<p>Establishment: In July, the Dahua Nail Factory was established after preparation.</p>
<p>Resumption of Business: In July, only Aoleima Chemical Company at No. 200 Jiayi Road resumed business.</p>
<p>Closure: There were 12 closures in July. Among them, the more important ones include Yixin Educational Supplies Manufacturing Factory, Hengyu Dyeing Workshop, Huaxing Thermos Factory, Wufu Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and Zhenfeng Bank. Since the collapse of the yarn and flower industry at the end of May, several companies still announced their liquidation in July. It can be seen that the consequences of this sharp fall in yarn prices can be said to be a serious blow. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Rehashing Old News Sixty-seven Years Ago (481) (See this newspaper from the twelfth year of Tongzhi of the defunct Qing Dynasty)</p>
<h3>Discriminating Abstinence (2)</h3>
<p>The customs of Wu venerate ghosts and gods. Almost every household has abstinence notices pasted on their doors, virtually everywhere. Whether due to public rituals or for the sake of protecting against illness, they treat it as a serious matter and readily believe in it! Women are especially so. There are those who "abstain for life," meaning they vow never to eat meat. There are those who "repay abstinence," usually for a period of three years. There are also those who observe "Thunder Abstinence," "Guanyin Abstinence," and "Three Officials Abstinence," all of which involve abstaining on certain days of each month. During these abstinence periods, even if there are celebrations and banquets with relatives and friends, they insist on having vegetarian dishes prepared by the kitchen. Even with delicacies in front of them, they never touch meat, and people praise their piety in observing abstinence, while those who understand the principles laugh secretly. Foolish men and women faithfully follow these practices, which is truly incomprehensible. In the past, Emperor Wu of Liang was the most devout Buddhist. He offered himself to Tongtai Temple three times, and his ministers redeemed him for millions of coins. He issued an order throughout the land to use wheat cakes as substitutes for sacrifices. His actions were like a dream, and later he was trapped in Taicheng, eventually starving to death while vomiting blood, and the country followed suit. What was the reason for this? I once saw someone who had been vegetarian for several years write on a memorial a request like "Repay a Vegetarian Meal, so-and-so receive and use." I couldn't help but burst into laughter! What is a vegetarian meal? Can it be quantified? And how can it be received and used? If fasting is taken as the intent to moderate eating and be careful of desires, and to reduce killing, there is nothing wrong with the righteous way. But many of the foolish masses act unrighteously, wanting to use this as a plan to eliminate sins, and are Kengkeng who abide strictly, and they are greatly mistaken.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous Feelings</p>
<h3>"Climbing Up" and "Self-Control"</h3>
<p>— Ding Ren</p>
<p>After reading "The Power of Self-Control" in this publication on the 6th of this month, I feel that there are a few points that are indeed worth discussing. Since we are fortunate enough to live and grow in this great era, on the one hand, we must dare to face reality and not escape it; on the other hand, we must never be ambiguous about the nature of the country we are growing in. Otherwise, I am afraid that even our own survival will feel disoriented!</p>
<p>In China, a semi-colonial and semi-feudal society, especially during the current transitional period, people often find themselves unable to find a way out and feel depressed. At the same time, due to the influence of the capitalist society that has been built and operated for decades, and the long-standing habit of living under foreigners, they cannot "self-control" and want to use the method of a few people surpassing the majority and "standing out from the crowd" to obtain their own status. But is this method feasible at present? Are there obstacles on this road? These are issues worth exploring.</p>
<p>First of all, the German poet Goethe said, "I want to be the master of myself." This sentence is good, but Goethe's biggest mistake was committing the fault of "individualism." He did not see that when the entire country and the entire nation cannot be their own masters, then you as an "individual" can only be a slave. This truth is undeniable and cannot be erased by anyone. There are many ready-made examples of "this kind of thing." The Jews are far away, and the wealthy and powerful people of countries such as the Czech Republic and Poland are nearby... What about them? Can they be "standing out from the crowd" and "excelling" without being expelled or bullied? The facts are the best explanation. Berlin's "anti-Jewish policy" does not distinguish between having wealth or power, or having a position. It treats and expels them all the same, and stateless people are always destined to wander and be tossed around. This is the suffering suffered by the Jewish people who take "individual" interests as a premise. Isn't the Czech Republic and Poland the same? In the end, it is all because a few people want to "preserve" their "individual interests" and are willing to be used by others, and as a result, they become "VIPs" in other people's "international hotels." These all start from individual "interests" and forget that they are part of a nation and a country, and they are rewarded with the loss of nationality. Then, with the "lessons of the past," should we Chinese people still start from the "individual," even if we know it is bad, and still "restrain, endure, be peaceful, and be content" to "climb up"? Or should we go to the broad masses of the people, be a part of the people ourselves, learn from everyone, and obtain the path to genuine self-cultivation? I think readers will choose which path to take.</p>
<p>Regarding "those who are parents should teach their children in a reasonable way," they should be taught how to learn to struggle and obtain the truth, rather than cultivate unconditional "endurance, peace, and contentment." Otherwise, the next generation of the Chinese nation will be even more unimaginable!</p>
<p>In short, I also agree with the use of "self-control," but it must be: holistic, national, and ethnic, not individual; at the same time, it must also be "hating evil like an enemy" and "getting to the bottom of things," rather than unconditionally and casually "self-control." Otherwise, the true meaning of self-control will be lost. If "self-control" is for "being qualified to manage and order others," this is the true face of some people, then that should be "discussed separately"!</p>

<h3>Aerial Photography by Reconnaissance Planes</h3>
<p>— Jie Liu</p>
<p>The work of aerial reconnaissance first requires well-trained pilots. Secondly, pilots must also be given detailed orders, directing them to specifically reconnoiter designated locations, so as not to be clueless. Aerial reconnaissance is easier if it is limited to a small number of locations. Conversely, if the pilot must pay attention to an entire vast area for a long period of time, then the work will naturally be very difficult. Modern air forces, in order to avoid the firing of anti-aircraft guns, must fly extremely fast and very high. At the same time, the camouflage of enemy ground forces and anti-aircraft guns has also greatly improved. Therefore, the work of reconnaissance has become even more difficult. We must not forget that when the reconnaissance officer in a two-seater plane is looking at the ground or taking pictures, he is always in danger of being attacked by enemy planes. Therefore, reconnaissance planes are now gradually being changed to three-seater planes.</p>
<p>However, aerial photography can make up for this difficulty in reconnaissance. It has the following major advantages:</p>
<p>1.  Photographs can capture subtle details that the eye cannot recognize, and sometimes even observers on the ground cannot see them. (Because of the different angles). The biggest advantage of photographs is that they can be carefully studied to obtain important clues. After enlarging a clear photo, many things that reconnaissance officers cannot see can be accurately discovered. Secondly, if many photos belonging to the same area but taken at different times are studied side by side, the enemy's actions can be understood and future trends can be predicted. This is an excellent way to study the dynamics of enemy train transportation, because we can accurately calculate the number of vehicles parked in the middle of each station on the photo. Also, everything on the road, such as vehicles, troops, and even individual pedestrians, can be found from photos taken of ordinary roads.</p>
<p>2.  Modern automatic cameras can photograph a narrow and long area on a roll of continuous photos. This type of photography is composed of many photos, with one half of each photo being the same as one half of the photo in front of it, so that they can be compared with each other during research. However, when taking this photo, the plane must fly at the same altitude, so that the photos taken are the same size, so that the photos can be put together to form an overall picture. As for the height of the plane, it should be determined according to the size of the required photos and the width of the area being photographed. This is a job that requires great accuracy, so the plane must fly horizontally in a straight line when taking pictures. However, at this time, enemy anti-aircraft guns and fighter planes are very likely to attack; therefore, reconnaissance planes must rely on the protection of other planes to photograph the ground scene over dangerous areas.</p>
<p>In addition to photos taken vertically from the air to the ground, it is sometimes necessary to take oblique photos in order to discover certain important clues. Planes often have to fly very low to take these photos, which is even more dangerous. At this time, ground machine guns and even rifles can shoot it down.</p>
<p>Recently, bombers, after each raid, must photograph the bombed area in order to improve the accuracy of their bombing.</p>
<p>3.  During the recent wars between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy for colonies, there were often many areas for which no maps were available for research. Aerial photography can meet part of the needs. In addition to the above-mentioned photography methods, there is also a long-distance camera that can clearly photograph distant scenery. There is also a specially made film that can sense infrared rays, which can capture everything on the ground in foggy weather, and its clarity is no less than that of photos taken in sunny weather.</p>
<p>The photographers on reconnaissance planes do not seem to attract much attention, but in fact their importance is no less than that of bombers and fighters.</p>
<h3>Seeking the Truth</h3>
<p>— Ling Tong</p>
<p>Some say that life is about striving to improve everything to seek the welfare of future generations. Some say that the meaning of life is to create the continuing life of the universe. Biology books tell us that human life in the world is to maintain and continue the life of its own species. Are you satisfied with these answers?</p>
<p>Henry David Thoreau once said: "The life of man is crushed by petty things; what we need is simplicity. Simplicity is our way of life. But now hypocrisy and deceit are regarded as the truth in the world, and the truth is regarded as absurd. We must put our feet into the mud that covers every part of the world - opinions, prejudices, preconceptions and fraudulent surfaces, etc. - until our feet touch a hard place, which is fact or truth. Then we can put up a sign so that we have a basis for our future days. As long as you see the truth, you can happily end your earthly career. Seeking the truth is the only purpose of life."</p>
<p>Seeking the truth is the purpose of life.</p>
<h3>Not Fabricated</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>In my article "The Necessity of Lying" on August 6, there are statements such as "Children from poor families lie more than children from wealthy families; girls lie more on average than boys," etc. Recently, a reader questioned the basis for the above two points. According to the books "Clinical Psychology" by Louttit and "Studies in Deceit" by Harshorne &amp; May, there are statistical materials published on this type. Therefore, the two points raised in the article are the results of actual research and investigation by American psychologists, and are not fabricated by me. I am hereby clarifying this to avoid misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Fate of the Dancing Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 5 Bad News</p>
<p>"Has he called the [dance hall] since?"</p>
<p>"Not yet, we're waiting for his news."</p>
<p>I hung up the phone and returned to the office, feeling quite flustered. Could Hawthorne have had an accident? Shi Gui stood beside me, and although he didn't speak, his eyes were clearly filled with concerned questions.</p>
<p>I explained to him briefly: "Mr. Hawthorne and I separated at the Asia Hotel. I went upstairs to monitor someone who was talking to Detective Ni in the phone booth. According to the report from the police station, the call seemed to be suddenly interrupted."</p>
<p>Shi Gui said in a trembling voice: "Mr. Bao, do you think something might have happened to Mr. Hawthorne?"</p>
<p>I simply couldn't answer, but looking at Shi Gui's expression, I couldn't help but answer.</p>
<p>"Maybe not, Shi Gui, don't panic—"</p>
<p>The phone rang again. After answering, I learned that it was Ni Jinshou.</p>
<p>He said urgently: "Mr. Bao, is there still no news about Mr. Hawthorne?"</p>
<p>I replied, "No, I was just about to ask you."</p>
<p>He said urgently again: "The news is very bad, he has been shot! ... Okay, wait a moment, I'll be there right away."</p>
<p>Hawthorne was shot! How could this news not surprise me? Where was he shot? In the Asia Hotel phone booth? But when I went down the elevator, I stood for a moment in front of the elevator door and also glanced at the phone booth, but I didn't see Hawthorne. (81)</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Two Major Dramas in the Gathering of Famous Actors</h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>Famous actors from both the North and South in Shanghai will hold a gathering at the Great Stage on the 20th, 21st, 22nd, and 23rd to raise funds for the Actors' Union. The program has been announced, including dramas such as "The Dragon and Phoenix Present Auspiciousness," "Cutting Hair to Replace the Head," and "Daming Prefecture." The dramas are performed by famous actors and the arrangements are well-organized, truly worthy of being a grand gathering of elites in the Shanghai opera scene in 1940.</p>
<p>Looking at the programs for the three days, the most noteworthy ones are the consecutive performances of "Cutting Hair to Replace the Head" and "Daming Prefecture" featuring Shi Wengong. These two dramas were both very popular in the past opera scene. In recent years, the "star" system of opera performers has become increasingly developed, and these dramas that emphasize both sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted face), chou (clown), and both civil and military roles have gradually become unpopular, which is a pity!</p>
<p>"Cutting Hair to Replace the Head" was originally a zheng gong xi (main play) for wusheng (male martial role). Since Tan Xinpei performed it as a xusheng (male role with beard), xusheng were even ashamed if they could not perform this drama. When Shuyan was at his peak, he also used this drama as an attraction. As the trend went, it changed from being a zheng gong xi for xusheng to being performed by wusheng. In this gathering, Zhou Xinfang plays Zhang Xiu, Zhao Ruquan plays Cao Cao, Furongcao plays Zou, Zhang Yipeng and Lin Shusen play the preceding and following Dian Wei, and Li Zhonglin plays Hu Che'er. The arrangement is complete and the skills are evenly matched. It is expected that the performance will allow the audience to greatly enjoy the drama.</p>
<p>"Daming Prefecture" tells the story of Lu Junyi being forced to go to Liangshan. The roles it contains, whether sheng, dan, jing, chou, or mo, and whether civil or military, are as important as "Cutting Hair to Replace the Head." I have often seen it in rural stage performances in the early years. At that time, when Lu Junyi played by the civil and military laosheng (old male role) Xiao Longbang, the prostitute Jia played by huadan (young female role) Haitanghong, and Li Gu played by the pockmarked Xiao Mian performed this drama in one place, people from far and near would compete to watch it. When it came to the performance of the treacherous servant and lewd woman colluding to frame the master, the audience would all point their fingers in anger. When the Liangshan heroes robbed the execution ground, there was a burst of cheers. The seriousness of the performance made people feel as if they were in the situation. In this gathering, Zhou Xinfang plays Lu Junyi, Furongcao plays Jia, Han Jinkui plays Li Gu, Zhao Ruquan plays Shi Qian, and Gai Jiaotian takes on the role of Shi Wengong. With Xinfang's sad grandeur, Tongshan's shrewishness, Jinkui's viciousness, Ruquan's experience, and Gai Jiaotian's martial skills, a perfect combination, it should also be a sensation.</p>
<h3>Zhao Ruquan Re-stages Lu Genrong</h3>
<p>— Tai Wu Jushi</p>
<p>—Jin Taiwen Joins to Play Huang Huiru—</p>
<p>This year, the entertainment scene in Shanghai seems to be advocating a "retro movement." Folk stories such as "Meng Jiangnu," "Painting the Golden Phoenix," and "The Gorgeous Marriage" are being put on the silver screen by the film industry. The case of Yan Ruisheng murdering Wang Lianying, which caused a sensation twenty years ago, has been put back on the stage by the opera scene and has been playing for nearly a month, with strong ticket sales.</p>
<p>In view of the popularity of the new play "Yan Ruisheng" among the ordinary classes (the so-called middle-class taste), the Gong Stage has now decided to re-stage the story of a servant and mistress love affair from twelve years ago, which is "Huang Huiru and Lu Genrong."</p>
<p>At that time, the first theater in Shanghai to stage this play was the Shanghai Stage (now the old site of Tianchan), with Zhao Ruquan playing Lu Genrong and Zhao Junyu playing Huang Huiru. It ran for several months and the ticket sales remained strong. Three years later, Zhao Ruquan joined the Sanxing Stage and re-staged this play, and it was still able to attract audiences.</p>
<p>Now Zhao Ruquan will re-stage this play, which was popular twelve years ago, at the Gong Stage, with the new actress Quan Suwen playing Huang Huiru. The actors of the Gong Stage have always been known for performing new plays. In addition, the stage scenery of the Gong Stage is second to none in Shanghai. It is currently being rehearsed and will be staged after "The New Celestial River Match."</p>
<p>It is said that the most realistic scenes include the stock exchange market, the scenery of the Rising Sun Building, the scene of prostitutes soliciting customers and gangsters drinking tea on Fourth Avenue's Qinglian Pavilion, the East Asia Hotel, the court trial, and platforms on the stage, etc. The most exciting part is the continuously changing scenery, such as the Rising Sun Building changing into the interior scene of the Sincere Company department store, with escalators and shoppers coming and going; then changing into the elevator of the East Asia Hotel, with Huang and Lu entering hand in hand, the elevator rising from below; then changing into the interior scene of the hotel, the elevator rising from below the stage, with Huang and Lu coming out of the elevator. All of the above are changed in the fastest possible way.</p>
<p>Bai Yuyan is also a new and important actress hired by the Gong Stage. In this play, a scene of the entrance of the Gong Stage will be re-created on the stage, changing into the interior of the Gong Stage, with many ushers and audience members. Huang and Lu are also among the audience. A small Gong Stage will be set up on the stage, and this small stage will be used for Bai Yuyan's performances. Bai performs an old play every day, either a martial arts play with a lot of fighting or a civil play that emphasizes both singing and acting. A new play interspersed with old plays, a play within a play, is also a unique feature on the stage. The grand occasion on the day of the performance can be expected.</p>
<h3>Playwright Huang Zuolin, Who Studied in England, Joins the Drama and Art Society</h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>Directs "Small Town Story"</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama and Art Society, whose summer performance is about to end, had planned to greatly enrich the talent after the autumn performance begins, and this plan is being implemented step by step. The first is that playwright Huang Zuolin, who studied in England, has joined the Drama and Art Society. Mr. Huang studied drama in England for several years and has a wealth of knowledge and experience. He is a new and capable talent among the few drama experts who have studied abroad in the country. After returning to China, he taught at the National Drama School and cultivated many young war drama talents. Now, he has been hired by the Drama and Art Society and is beginning to work on Yuan Jun's five-act comedy, "Small Town Story," with such care and seriousness. After "Night Shanghai," we will be able to see his directed works. In addition, a playwright who studied in the United States and a performer who studied in England will also join the Drama and Art Society. In terms of personnel, excellent actors working in the interior will also be invited to Shanghai to participate. At the same time, the "Summer Training Class" has also created many new talents, and it is expected that six or seven people will be admitted as formal actors. Judging from this situation, the Shanghai Drama and Art Society will have a new start after the autumn.</p>
<h3>About "Confucius"</h3>
<p>— Luo Cun</p>
<p>The debut work of the Minhua Film Company, "Confucius," has been completely completed after filming in August. It is said that it will be premiered at the Grand Theater on the 27th of this month, Confucius's birthday. The film is directed by Fei Mu. We know his style, which has always been unhurried and not carelessly made. We believe that this director "Confucius" will definitely have a good harvest. There are a few points about the film that are worth reporting to the readers:</p>
<p>The entire film cost more than 16,000 feet of film, and after editing, two-thirds remained.</p>
<p>Scenery—such as palaces and all great buildings, were personally designed by Fei Mu's younger brother, who is a bachelor of civil engineering from a university and also has a lot of research on archaeology, so the scenery of Confucius's hometown was very carefully rebuilt. When it is premiered, we can feast our eyes.</p>
<p>During the filming of the scene of Zilu fighting to the death, because the performance was realistic and the fighting was too intense, one of the actors fell from a more than two-丈 high platform and was injured, and Zhang Yi also had many gun and knife wounds, which shows that all the actors worked very hard.</p>
<p>In order to respect "Confucius," Fei Mu asked the company not to publicly publish photos of him and Confucius together in any newspapers, which shows Mr. Fei's respectful attitude towards the sage.</p>
<p>It is said that film merchants from various Nanyang provinces have been rushing to buy copies of "Confucius" from Min Hua. It turns out that overseas Chinese in Nanyang have a psychology of respecting Confucius. Since the filming of "Confucius," they have paid attention to it long ago. As for the cast of the film, it is copied as follows:</p>
<p>Tang Huaiqiu—plays Confucius.</p>
<p>Murong Wan'er—plays Nanzi.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi—plays Zilu.</p>

<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Edited by Putian Yun Xue Zheng</p>
<p>Game 197 Blue Field Scattered Colors</p>
<p>Proposed by Zhang Dingcheng</p>
<p>Challenge Answer: Red Moves First and Wins</p>
<p>Notice (1) We welcome answers to this game, with a time limit of one week. The first seven correct answers will receive a small reward. Please send your answers to 271 Da Lu Road. (2) If you have the Complete Collection of Chinese Chess Scores, Volume 2, or the Newly Compiled Chinese Chess Scores (thank you in advance), please send a letter to me if you are willing to part with them. New or old is fine.</p>
<p>Also, in the Battle General Game, change the red cannon on row 1 column 3 to row 1 column 1 (draw), otherwise red wins.</p>
<p>Explanation of Game 68 The red pawn advancing 1 from column 9 should be answered by the black chariot advancing 6 from column 2. The red chariot can then advance 3 from column 9, exchanging chariots and seizing the initiative. Then the black cannon moves to column 7 from column 8, to the red affair moving to column 4 from column 1, all of which are official moves. At this point, although the black side has the initiative, the red side's responses are appropriate and can maintain the balance.</p>
<p>Also, in the Earthworm Descending Dragon Game, black has no elephant on row 9 column 3 and a cannon on row 7 column 7. This is hereby corrected.</p>
