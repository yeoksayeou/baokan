<h3 id="c12">太平洋問題之重心 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>近一週來，注意太平洋問題者、咸置其重點於荷屬東印度之危機。本月十五日、日外相有田於特別閣議後宣稱，渠對於可使荷屬東印度地位發生變化之任何局勢，，表示關切之意。度其用心，不外兩點；一則所以安慰國內衰疲之民氣，示以日本猶有積極向外發展之雄圖與餘力；二則藉此測量國外之反響——特別窺探美國之反應如何，以爲推行南進攻策之參攷。美國務卿赫爾氏乃以嚴正之態度，發爲獅吼，於十七日發表聲明曰：荷屬東印度羣島現狀之任何變更，將損害太平洋之和平與安全，爲條約所不容，美國所不許。以美國盛强之國勢，爲赫爾氏聲明之後盾，日本勢將不能不知難而暫退。就表面判斷，荷屬檔印度之危機，殆將暫告一段落。雖然，國際風雲方亟，而日本之侵略慾無止境，若謂太平洋乃因赫　爾氏之一言而遂得化險爲夷，則問題固不若是之簡單，抑局勢亦不若是之樂觀也。</p>
<p>日本今日在國際間，猶未示人以弱而稍歛其咄咄逼人之氣燄；其所書恃者無他，在海軍耳。據最近調查，目前英美日三大海軍國，其實力之比較，英國艦隊各級艦隻共二百零五萬餘噸，其中在建築中者占七十二萬噸弱；美國艦隊共計約一百七十五萬餘噸，其中在建築中者占四十七萬餘噸；日本艦隊共計約一百萬零七千餘噸，其中在建築中者佔二十六萬餘噸。英國海軍現方集中全力應付歐戰，其角逐於太平洋上者，厥惟美日。從數字觀察，美日海軍總噸位雖爲五對三之比；但在實力上，美國雖擁有主力艦十滿，對日本之各級軍艦，多屬新型，不　免相形見絀；是以五三之經，不無疑問，然亦決不能據此遂謂日本之海軍竟足以在西太平洋壓倒美國，或美國之海軍不敵日本也。蓋現代之戰爭，國力綜合之戰爭也，勝負之數，不僅決於武力之高下，尤有關於整個國力，特別是經濟力之强弱。日本自從發動全面侵華戰事以來，三十四閱月矣，其軍費之消耗，應不下於一百五十萬元，兵力之傷亡，應不下於一百萬人；且中國之英勇抗戰，今方在積極擴大中，所謂「中國事變」者，在日本誠爲附骨之疽，寗有餘力以應付美日戰爭乎？而美國則經濟力之雄厚，居全世界首席；近者，九六三，〇〇〇，〇〇〇美元之文生補充造艦案，亦已爲眾院所核准，大勢判斷，必可在參議院通過；關島設防之案，亦由海軍作戰部長史達克上將重行提出於國會。凡此種種，日本旣嫉忌，又恐懼，然終無要叨嘮何者，客觀條件所限，力不能勝也。况日本軍需資源之輸入，半數以上，依賴美國；據美國商務部長霍甫金氏調查，美國之供給日本者，爲其重工業必需品百分之五六，原棉百分之四〇，五金百分之四〇，機器百分之五〇，石油百分之六五。故美國在經濟上實行絕交，即足制日死命，日本之外强中乾，從可知矣。</p>
<p>日本國力脆弱如此，然其侵略野心，實無止境。吾人所可得而斷言者，日本軍閥之侵略野心存在一日，太平洋即一日無和平可言，五十年來一部遠東歷史，充滿血淚，皆其明證也。日本之侵略目標，向北則由朝鮮而滿州，由滿洲而蒙古，又由滿蒙而及全中國；向南則由琉則台灣，由台灣而海南島，今且將更進而覬覦荷屬東印度矣。去歲二月十一日，即日軍進擾海南島之翌日，蔣委員長發表談話，其言有曰：「是本在太平洋上有三個最重要之戰略據點，在北島樺太島，在西爲海南島，在東爲關島。……且欲造成此三大據點聯絡線，處心積慮，已有三十年之外」。然則日本對荷屬東印度之覬覦，亦示嘗不可以解釋爲企圖切斷英美聯絡，準備進一步奪取關島與菲律賓，先聲奪人，以制美國；此誠整個太平洋問題之重心也。日人品性沈鷙貪很，非至絕境，不知回頭，而其國力之漸趨衰疲，適足以使其欲求之亢進與急進。不聞彼邦權威雜誌「外交時報」以次之雜誌報紙所昌言者乎？彼在南京方面之佈置，以及阿部使團之來華，即所以謀制華而排擠英美，總之，可以象徵日閥對於大陸之繼續急進侵略者也。而外相有田之所宣稱，則視爲日閥將對太平洋發動猛烈攻勢之徵象可也。養虎貽患，智者不取，察近日美國當局之所表示，强毅逾恒，似已瞿然於優容之非計；然謂即此表示而不作切實行動，便得制止侵略者之野心，消弭太平洋之大患，則日人品性不若是也。</p>

<p>美國民主，共和，兩大政黨，對於下屆總統候選人，已絡精在各州舉行初選，民主黨方面，似傾向於推舉羅斯福連任第三屆總統，這種活動，祗有羅斯福總統說一聲「吾」才能加以阻止，然而民主黨幹部相信羅斯福總統將在數星期之後，才能表示贊成或反對，目前決不致抑制這活動，所以黨中已經擬定競選計計劃，預定在七月十五日該黨舉行全國委員會議時，要求羅斯福首肯。</p>
<p>其第一步係三月十二日，在新罕普夏州舉行總統初選，產生一個擁護羅斯福的代表團，來策動競選的進行，然後於四月二日在威期康辛州舉行總統初選，取得擁護羅斯福的進步黨的援助，擊敗加入競選的副總統賈納，一星期後，伊利諾州民主黨舉行初選，因爲該州佔有大勢力的凱萊與納煦兩人所領導的集團，和州長霍納，都熱烈擁護羅斯爾連任第三屆總統，威斯康辛和伊利諾兩州初選結果揭曉之後，副總統賈納便可知難而退，奧萊岡，和加利福尼亞兩州，則定於五月間舉行初選，該兩州的黨幹部，也贊成羅斯福連任第三屆總統，各該州初選結果揭曉後，那些想向西部各州進行推舉參議員惠勒爲候選運動的人，也可放棄向西活動的一切意念了。</p>
<p>擁護羅斯福連任第三屆總統的幹部並擬將各州民主黨大會和各州民主黨執行委員會推定的許多代表團，聯合起來，以壯聲勢，他們相信這是容易辦到的，因爲各州榦部人物大多數已在第三屆運動的陣營中了，這種推測，已無人加以懷疑，競選運動到了這種形勢，祇有羅斯福本人確切表示不願再出競選，才能阻止道種運動，可是，即使如此，所謂第三屆運動派也還能照預定計劃，進行活動，或克克服這層困難</p>
<p>羅斯福對於競選問題，暫時不致發表意見，這有若干種事件足資憑信，其中最重要的，便是羅斯福對於伊利諾州的初選情形，始終保持緘默，他的大名被人作爲該州初選名單，他旣未公開加以核准，也沒有要救加以除去，羅斯福爲何聽任他的大名留在選舉票上，實屬耐人尋味，或謂羅斯福本人已在暗中積極活動，或調羅斯福在鞏固勢力，一俟時機成熟，即保舉某人爲候選總統，以集中的勢力，促其當選。</p>
<p>還有一說，羅斯福派遣國務决長韋爾斯赴歐，係在預留進退地步，他要批閱韋爾斯的報吿之後，才能對於是否願意連任第三屆總統問題，切實表示意見，歐洲的和戰問題與美國的政治實具有不可分離的關係，威爾遜總統前在一九一六年競選時旣知道這層，羅斯福總統亦非門外漢，他在白宮閒談中曾吐露一種口氣，說他雖不求戀棧四年，但歐洲戰爭如若變本加厲，他爲保持美國不捲入漩渦起見，繼續秉政，也是責無旁貸，林德萊也曾在他所作的羅斯福傳中引着羅斯福的談片說，「我有些厭倦，不願再參加競選了，這時應由他人繼任，但若德軍打敗英國，乘戰勝的餘威，威脅美國，我斷不能許諾職守」，這樣看了，美國下屇總統屬於何人可以思過半了。（譯New　YorkTimes，　　New　YorkHerald　Trlbune）</p>

<p>英美大美晚報昨發表一文、述及日本國內恐怖黨徒之組織及其如何操縱政治情形頗詳、該文首述日本現在國際上處於孤立地位、到處咸被斥責為威脅世界和平之侵略者、其原因乃國內恐怖黨徒積極活動、此種黨徒以</p>

<p>而「戰士」則為秘密愛國團體向各商店暮捐、不肯捐欵者當被斤為「不愛國」、在中國之浪人均屬日本反動會社所雇用、會社之至大勢力者為黑龍會、頭山滿為共首領、該會活動專在反對蘇聯、而其他浪人、則壓抑罷工反危險份子，在東京不久以前、某</p>

<p>滬西流動戰、連日甚為活躍、日方現正調動重兵、約二三千乏衆、並附以偽軍約一千人、佈防於沿蘇州河及靑滬公路一帶、此項日軍自遭華流動部隊襲擊之後、連日大事屠殺無辜村民、「八一三」滬戰華軍撤退之時、日軍所進行之慘劇、現又重演於離上海租界不足二十公里之虹橋飛機塲以西地區、茲據昨午由該地來滬之鄕民所談各情、分誌於後、</p>
<p>接戰三次</p>
<p>據悉沿靑滬公路附近之華方游擊隊、於最近與日軍發生三次接觸、第一次為本月十二日、在虹橋機塲西北沿蒲滙塘之小連橋、激戰達五小時、第二次為本月十五日、在靑滬交界地區之徐涇趙巷附近、激戰七小時之久、第三次為滬西七寶鎭以西杜家行附近、激戰亦達三小時、於此三次戰事中、尤以本月十五日趙巷一役、日軍受創最重、實為上海近郊任何流動戰所罕有、</p>
<p>顧部突圍</p>
<p>日軍於本月十二日、首遭華軍襲擊之後、在虹橋機塲以西、靑浦以東、滬杭鐵路以北、蘇州河以南之區域內、抽調日偽軍約三四千名、坦克車二十餘輛、幷同時出動飛機、從事所謂「掃蕩」、以冀一網打盡華軍、所有滬西各據點如虹橋·七寶·蟠龍·諸翟·莘莊·泗涇·錢涇·黃波·南翔·觀音堂·等各鎭、約增駐重兵、形成包圍形勢、迄至昨午、尙未撤退、但華軍第三支隊顧復生部、聞業於前日衝山重圍、移至安全地帶休養、</p>
<p>鄕民刧運</p>
<p>惟日軍於受創之後、懷恨村民容留華軍、乃先接在諸翟·觀音堂·杜家行·各地、大事焚燒農民村落、房屋之被燬者、至少在一千餘幢以上、而村民之遇見日軍、無分老幼、即遭槍殺、或刺刀戳斃、以觀音堂一地而論婦孺老幼之慘遭荼毒者、共達五百人左右、諸翟附近約二百餘人、七寶以西之杜家行、亦達一百人左右、因之該地村民之略有資財者、相率避滬、即困苦無依者、亦已逃亡他鄕、附近各鎭、已十室九空、又訊、靑滬路戰事‵顧部於前晚安然引退、日偽軍即分兩路進駐、一路由徐涇向北重固親音堂、一路由徐涇向南杜家巷小連橋一帶、挨戶搜查、槍殺農民、不計其數、老幼婦女、多遭侮辱、</p>
<p>日方防務</p>
<p>滬西虹橋詻飛機塲、原有房屋甚多、滬戰時全被炸燬、該處為滬西要道日方擬派重兵駐守、以防游擊隊襲擊、故於前日起、在機塲東首（即坡亞司路口）、建造營房五十餘間、均用舊磚砌成、</p>
<p>襲擊汽車</p>

<p>馮炳南先生致詞救濟中山難民會舉行慈善播音開慕才期、承蒙該會不棄、　鄙人致開慕詞、本應親目到電台來播送的、但是鄙人身體不大好、所以在家中閉門養病、已經兩年有多、至今尚未能州門、據醫生囑咐、是絕對不容外出的、所以根本就不宜於担任開慕致詞這件事、但是又承救濟中山難民會諸君為鄙人設想周全、說是新都電台裝置了轉播的新機、鄙人可以在家中用電話轉播、這可見他們各位對於鄙人見許太過了、所以雖自知不宜於担任、也不好十分堅辭、今天鄙人僅能够坐在家中說話、而未能親到電台、這是萬分抱歉的、鄙人一向對於服務社會人羣、認為是人生最高的天職、只要是義所當為、而又是力所能及、都無不樂於應命、因為鄙人覺得天地萬物、皆為一體、圓顱方趾、都是同類、同類有需要到我效勞的地方、豈有不樂於盡力之理、全人類旣然像一整個身體、則身體的一部分受了創痛、別個部分就得去照顧它、一處地方不幸而有了災難、沒有災難或災難較輕的地方就應該去幫忙它、一部分人受着困苦、沒有困苦或困苦比較不嚴重的人就該想法給他們懈救、如果身體一部分受了創傷、而別的部分不知不覺、不去理會、這個人就是麻木不仁了、中山縣不幸一再遭難、災情的慘重、可以想見、諸位聽衆、想來不少是親身經過患難的生活的、現在我們算居住在比較安全的地域、但是別忘記了在不太平的地域的同類們的悲慘、日夜担心着飛機炸彈、受了傷的不一定得到醫藥的照料、有許多幸而沒有受傷的、往往在烈日下捱着不可忍受的飢渴、不但想吃一口飯不容易、甚至連一口水也喝不到、山頭露宿、風雨交加、因此生病的也很多、悲慘的情景、有非言語所能形容其萬一、他們時時刻刻在等候着死亡、又時時刻刻在期待着有人心的同類們來加以拯救、現在，中山縣的同鄕們、感覺到家鄕所受的非常慘痛、發起這個會以謀救濟、這確是有自助的精神、能够自助的、便有資格請人家的幫助、所以中山同鄕固應熱烈贊助此舉、即非中山的同鄕、甚至終無論什麽地方的人們、都有幫忙的義務、不論一個人、一個地方、或者一個國家，首先要有自助的精神、把自己的能力發揮盡致了、再有需要時、便可以請求他人的帮助、在人家請求自已帮助的時候、如果所請求是合理的、而自問又是有此能力的、便應該絕不遲疑絕不吝惜的加以帮助、因為互助是人類最高的道德、也是人類所以能够生存的　要的條件、不獨非常時要互助、在平常時也要互助、誰都不能不盡別人的帮助誰都不應該不帮助他人、人類和禽獸之所以不同、人類所以能在世界上生存了好幾千萬年、就因為發展了這互助人類所以能在世界上生存了好幾千萬年、就因為發展了這互助的德性、在不自覺之中互助了、惟有互助、才有社會、惟有互助、才有世界、現在的災難、不止中山一處、也不止中國一處、全世界四分之三都在非常浩刦之中、正是天翻地覆的時候、就算是居住在比較無事的上海的人們、也不免多少蒙受到這個災難的影響、每天打開報紙來看時、幾乎有五分之四都是報吿着人類在受苦難的消息、人類旣是在這樣苦難的刦運之中、更應該要發揮其互助的精神、才能獲得生存、同在一隻船中、在風平浪靜的時候、尚且要彼此合作、若一旦波濤險惡、則更需要大家帮忙、才可以平安渡過、今日我能助人、他日人家也會助我、一個人需要人家帮助的地方很多、不一定指災難而言、這一次上海救濟中山難民會舉行慈善播音而籌款救濟、許多藝員和業餘藝人、義務演唱、這便是有力者出力、各位聽衆觀衆、多多捐助點唱、這便是有錢者出錢、極合互助的宗旨、對於這出錢出力的兩方面的熱心人士、不獨救濟中山難民會應該感謝、就是關切人類福利的人士、也應當感謝、鄙人也是自居人類之一，所以對於出錢出力的各位人士各位藝員、亦當表示感謝、這個會之舉行、不止同鄕贊助、並且已經獲得別省人士的同情、剛才聽說、虞洽卿·金廷蓀·袁履登·林康侯先生等對於這個會的同情、請外省的藝員來帮忙一天的節目、本來預定兩天節目的播音、現在延長為三天、可見互助之心、人人同具、虞洽卿·金廷蓀兩先生和各位外省藝員的熱心、是值得我們非常感謝的、有人對於播音演劇的舉行、或者會加以指摘、以為在此兵荒馬亂顚沛流離的時期中、何忍舉行娛樂、歐陽修不說過嗎、「憂勞可以興國、逸豫可以亡身」、鄙人以為關於娛樂、可以有兩種看法、凡事都有個限度、凡事之合乎限度的、都是對的、超過限度的、便是不好、娛樂也是如此、過度的娛樂、可以令人玩物喪志、可以廢時失事、可以勞神傷財、適合限度的娛樂、可以調節精神、增加作事的效率、故人在極度疲勞極度緊張之後、能以娛樂為消解、則精神容易恢復、健康不至受損、中國古時六藝之中、樂·射·御三件事情、佔了一半、音樂·射箭·騎馬、都是屬於娛樂之事、好比一個人在工作疲勞之後、不能不睡眠一樣、我們不能說在危難之中、便不許睡眠、在危急存亡之秋、調節精神、維護健康、亦是一件重要的事、越是煩愁苦悶、越是需要娛樂、娛樂本身並不壞、只要看娛樂的性質是否高尚而已、古來賢智之士、亦不免借酒解愁、不過過度飮酒、未必對於健康有益、然而我們已可見得在緊張苦悶的時候誰都需要調節的、鄙人說這些話、並非為娛樂的營業者作辯護、乃係根據事實而言、而且本人除了以讀書為娛樂外、對於其他一般的娛樂都沒有嗜好、對於娛樂的營業也沒有參加、所以本人是最有資格來說這句公正的話的、最後、鄙人希望各位聽衆、不分省界、不分縣界、並且不分國界、凡有人類互助的同情心的、都熱烈贊助救濟中山難民會的這次的救濟工作、鄙人說了許多話、費了各位的時間不少、現在謹以人類之一員的資格、向各位聽衆表示感謝、向工作出力的人員表示感謝、</p>

<p>天開於子，地關於丑，人生於寅，是為三才，亦即三統，而三代分建歲首遞尙之。孔子吿顏子，必曰行夏之時，何也？　時周正建子，孔子布衣敢非諸本期朝之正朔乎，實有見於建子建丑之不如建寅也。堯命義和曰：敬授人時。即此以繹其義，可見時之所重在人也。故夏正建寅，而四時不失其序，建子建丑，改冬為春矣。秦正建亥，繫冬十月為正月，則竟易為冬春夏秋矣。有孔子之教，為王者取法，自漢而後，皆用夏正，於是歲首有定制，而人生於寅之義以明。周雖用子，而周公作爾雅　歲名，亦始寅而終丑，則用天統者，亦不過三王不相沿襲之意，藉以明一代之所尙，而以建寅為正，亦未始不知其義也。惟歲首宜用寅，故以甲子統紀年月日時，而時以寅為明也。天時地時不言，而獨言人時者，義繫乎人也。歲至寅而更新，亦時至寅而蚤起。假以一年之終始，一日之終始言之，則亥為終，子為始，宜乎歲首　子月，天明為子時，而無如人時之義不明矣。今試以人言之，自歲首以至歲除，無一日閒，其所行之事，必於歲一綜核之，假而　事順，　一年之利有大盈　，必　　明年之更倍於此也；假令運逢杌揑，事不遂意，統計折耗幾何，必曰明年殆　盈　，是又有奢望也。願使人人知歲首建寅　在人時之義，而急圖所以自全也。</p>

<p>— 鏞</p>
<p>小朋友們！現在孤島上的各種物價都似飛般的高漲，你們都知道嗎？我想凡是有智　的各們小朋友，他們都在設法怎樣來節約了。總之，在這個時候，是不應該再把你們父母的金錢任意的浪費才是。最低的限度對於下列的幾個不良的習慣從今天起應該有則除之，無則加勉。</p>
<p>一，吃閒食：吃閒食非但耗費金錢，並且有害身體，你看有許多小朋友，他們終日吃閒食，以致弄得向黃肌瘦，營養缺乏。適當有節制的飲食，這是獲取健康的唯一秘訣，請各位能够把這句話牢記著。</p>
<p>二，看連環圖畫：小朋友們在空暇的時候，常常喜歡向父母討了幾分錢到街頭巷弄裏的小書攤上云租幾部武俠神怪的連環圖畫來作消遣；這種書可以　與小朋友們是絕對無益的，所以亦是屬於浪費之二，各位不妨把討得的錢積儲起來後，到書局裏去揀幾本實用而有意義的書，那是有益得了。</p>
<p>三，亂塗紙張：小朋友中十之八九看到有一張雪白的紙張時，、就喜歡拿來亂塗一陣，塗後就把它丟去，還有的是把整本的練習薄，不知道愛　地來川，前撕一張，後撕一張：這種惡習亦不是一個好學生所應有的，損喪物力，這該屬於最大的浪費呢！</p>
<p>以上三點，差不多是在小朋友間最容易發現的。如果有一位是三皆不患，那麼是已够體諒了你們的家長，至於談到怎樣來減　家長們的負擔及增加家　間的收入這項問題，却不是你們的力量　能勝任。</p>
<h3 id="c111">危險的磁性水雷不危險了 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 陸安之</p>
<p>小朋友們，假使你們記性好的話，總記得在這决歐戰爆發後二三個月中，報上每天常有英法或中立國的船隻，因觸水雷而慘遭沉沒。但研究其觸雷的原因，大都由於遇到德國最近發明的磁性水雷，因爲這種水雷，裝有極强的電磁石，在海面自由移動。所以有船隻在附近航過時，就能吸住這些水雷，以致爆炸。爲了防止這種水雷的危險，英法各國的科學家，費了許多工夫研究避免觸雷的方法，於數月前，終於想出了一種方法，來防止這種可怕的水雷，這種防禦方法就是在商船或兵艦身上，能免去用鋼鐵做的機械，如汽鍋，推進機，引擎等，總設法免除，而以鋁等合金代替，其决就是於船的首尾，置有兩個極强烈的反磁電磁石，因同種磁性是互相排斥的，所以磁性水雷非但不能走近船隻一步，反而遠而避去。現在英法的大商船，都備有這種裝置，所以能很安穩地渡過危險四伏的大西洋。至於船上的機械，所以不能用鋼鐵製造，因爲這種極强烈的反磁電磁，能影響鋼鐵製的機器轉動等，據說德國潛水艇上，很早就裝有這種電磁石，也是防止自已　雷的危險，不過是嚴守秘密的，現在被英法也利用了這種磁性水雷，去加緊封鎖德國的海岸綫，這也可說是　武者的報應了。</p>
<h3 id="c112">光的曲折 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 蘇明</p>
<p>到得時鐘打了七下，不論在平日或是放假日，庸兒已起了身洗凈了臉，漱淸了口，更喝杯鹽湯，這一件事成了他的習慣，假使有一天有沸水冲鹽湯，那使他覺到十二分的不暢快，非等着喝到了不可，吾則寗願不吃早餐的。</p>
<p>今天他起了身，洗臉漱口之後，便把水冲在有鹽的杯子裏，更把一隻筷在杯裏掬了一掏，這樣可使　溶得快一些。那知今天他無意中又發現了一個奇蹟——常他放下筷在水裏時，從杯外看去，那隻筷似乎是曲了一曲，要折斷的樣兒，他急忙把筷從水中拿起來，却完好如舊，再放下水去，又曲折了。他便　生了疑問，就去請敎他的哥哥——宗兒：「爲什麼筷在水中，有曲折的現象」？</p>
<p>「這是個物理的光學原理，光在空氣中是直綫的進行，故我們叫它光綫，可是光從某一環續轉到另一環境，會改變它的途徑，這是自然界中很奇異的現象。你所發生的疑問，便是這種現象，因爲光錢從空氣而到水中，空氣和水是兩種不同的物質，光綫便會發生曲折的現象。爲什麼光綫到水中，不保持自己所有的力向而要曲折呢？這似乎是一件莫明其妙的事情，如果把它仔細實騐和觀察也可獲得滿意的結果」</p>
<p>「那麼怎樣實騐，才可認識光綫所走的路徑和發生曲折的現象呢？而光綫又是無色無味無臭的東西，這眞不容易實騐，也不容易觀察」。席兒說完了道話，眼見得他哥哥去拿了一塊桌布和一個沒有綫的洋綫軸（就是縫衣用的洋綫　，能够滾動的）。宗兒先把桌布遮住桌子的半，便開口說道：「我們以這個玩意兒來作爲光綫曲折的例了」。說時，更使桌子傾斜，便把那滾軸在高處滾下去，軸是斜的，進行到桌布的邊緣，它就要曲折的在桌布上　去。宗兒又繼續的說道：「這因爲在分界處運動的速度有差異，顯然可見從桌上運動的速度較大，而移行到速度較小的蓋布部分，那軸便有曲折，而軸即代表光綫，從這個實騐，我們便可觀察到光綫曲折的現象。爲什麼發生曲折？也可解答了。總之，光在空氣中和水中的速度是不同的，那就發生曲折，如果速度的相差越大，則曲折也愈大。假使那軸是直的滾到桌布的邊緣上，就不會發生曲折。這現象更可用軍隊行軍來比喻，假如有一橫隊從平坦的硬地向高低不平的地上進行，那必定會减低速度，因爲要繞越過不便行走的道路而趨向到平坦的大道，光綫所走的途徑，恰好和行軍的情形相似一。</p>
<h3 id="c113">一擔棉花一擔鐵 <a href="#c113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— 白水</p>
<p>星期六的晚上，父親母親哥哥弟弟大家團叙在一間屋子裏，大家要求着父親講故事。可是，父親想了又想，總是講不出來。忽然做哥哥的喊起來道：「父親的故事還沒有想出來，現在我有一個問題，誰能回答出來，便是誰的本領大。第弟聽了忙着問是那一個問題。哥哥說：「一擔棉花和一擔鐵是那一擔重一些」？弟弟聽了不加思索地說道一鐵重」。</p>
<p>母親在旁邊聽了笑着說：「傻孩子，你上了哥哥的常了！一擔是一百斤，那麼，不管是鐵是棉花，同樣的一百斤還有什麼輕重可言」！哥哥拍手笑道：一我知道弟弟要說鐵重的。今天，我們的先生吿訴我們，說是做一個科學家第一要心細，碰到一個問題，不可隨便貿然作答。我們先生說，年輕的人，碰到問題每易隨便的爽快作答，可是對不對他就不去計及了，這不是科學家應有的態度」。</p>
<p>弟弟被母親和哥哥這樣一說，紅着臉，幾乎要哭出來了。父親便出來說道：「我的故事不講了，我就來談談這一個問題吧！一擔棉花和一担鐵」　，雖然同是一百斤，但是有輕重的，所以弟弟的回答並不算錯。比方，前幾天一直下着雨，空氣十分潮濕，你去秤了一百斤的棉花和一百斤的鐵，當時確是一樣輕重的。可是，接着好幾天晴朗的大氣，先前秤着的一百斤棉花，在太陽中晒一過了幾决，你再秤一下，棉花一不到百斤，鐵仍是一百斤，這不是鐵比棉花重了嗎？反過來，在睛朗的天氣中秤了一百斤的棉花和一百斤的鐵，放在汽車上送到遠地去，汽車走到中途碰到了一陣雨，以後你再秤一下，棉花又比鐵重了。所以，鐵和棉花，雖然同樣一百斤，因了氣候和環境的不同，重量是不同的。因此，要說弟弟的回答不對，這句話就不大好說的一。</p>

<p>當下見岩石上開着種種的鮮花，五鐸繽紛，鮮綠的山苔，襯托著繁星般的淡紅色的花朵；溫柔可愛的龍膽草，比了天空的蔚藍色　藍得悅目；還有白色的百合花，潔白得好似透明的一樣。紅色和紫色的蝴蝶，穿來穿去的十分活發，抬頭瞧時，又見萬這祥光從半空中射下來，格勒處在這樣的環境中，覺得生平從來沒有如此快樂過。</p>
<p>但他再向山上爬了一點鐘光景，他又口渴得打熬不住了；向他那隻水瓶瞧時，只剩了五六滴水，再也不敢渴下去。他正待從新將瓶子掛在腰帶上時，却見一頭小狗躺在石上，在不住的喘著氣——這頭狗正是漢士先前上山時所遇到的。格勒站住了腳，向着它瞧，又轉眼瞧瞧黃金江，離開他的頭項已不到五百碼遠了，他想走過了狗，向上趕去，却聽得那畜生嗚嗚地叫着，煞是可憐，於是他又站住了。格勒對它起了無限的同情心，自言自語道：「可憐的畜生，我此刻要是不教它，停會兒下山來時，它一定死了一。說時，他在那狗瞧得更仔細了些，只見它的眼色十分悽慘，使他不忍再看。當下他　了一跺腳，放聲嚷道：「該死的黃金江的王，他的黃金我決計不要了」！於是拔去了瓶塞，把那剩餘的聖水，一起滴在狗的嘴裏。</p>
<p>那狗跳起身來，用兩條後腿作人立；一霎時間，它的尾兒不見了，它的耳朵漸漸的長起來，亮晃晃地像絲光，又像是黃金江的光彩，它的鼻子變成通紅，它的眼睛閃閃地發光，不過是二三秒鐘左右，那狗已不知到那裏去了，站在格勒面前的，卻是他的老友——黃金江的王。</p>
<p>王對格勒說道：「謝謝你，但你不要吃驚這一回事，你是幹得對的」。原來格勒想起剛才會大聲大氣咒罵過，定已給他老家聽得了，因此不免有些兒恐惶，流露到臉上來。黃金江的王接下去說道：「你先前為什麼不來？偏讓你那兩個可惡的哥子兒趕了來，累得我多費了一番手腳，把他們倆變做了石塊。他們已變做很堅硬的石塊了」。</p>

<p>— 鄧爾敬</p>
<p>戲劇的揷曲務須顧慮到戲劇的效果，即令是一首民謠也應穿揷得適當，所以顧仲彝在「梁紅玉」的每一首歌詞上都很小心的標註了它應有的旨趣。作曲方面除此更要顧慮到演唱者的技術以及其他種種困難。因之，揷曲是依附在戲上的，不能祗站在純音樂方面去欣賞</p>
<p>這裏第一首歌是妓女在主子飲酒行樂時所唱，即使「淫靡之音」也不妨，但拘於詞意與形式，所以音樂是由小調「民謠」的方式寫出，發酵的作用完全交給唱奏的人了，這種唱法不希望觀眾去摹仿。</p>
<p>第二首歌爲王子逼令梁紅玉舞劍時邊舞邊唱者。歌詞計有三段，詞意由哀怨而愼激，韓世忠爲之感動，乃拔劍同舞同唱。。</p>
<p>男兒立志去投軍，殺盡胡寇保家邦！</p>
<p>第三首歌是軍民台築城牆時所唱，節奏明顯如進行曲，共唱三段，曲調雖甚簡單，但詞意足以警惕一般睡夢的中人，因把歌詞錄後作本文之結尾</p>
<p>「風兒吹，雨兒飄，雷電交加出海蛟，打斷了牆，吹壞了巢，屋兒搖晃搖晃不定怕要倒，滿家性命都小保！只要弟兄們心一條，不怕風兒不怕蛟，只要忍得苦來耐得勞，同心合力把家保！</p>
<p>風兒吹，雨兒飄，狠心的豺狼打宋朝，搶我土地，殺我同胞，蹂躪我中華秦燕齊趙，國家命祚要不保。只要弟兄們心一條，不怕豺狼與虎豹，只要立定主義打到老，同心合力把國保。</p>
<p>角兒吹，鼓兒敲，全國男兒奮臂號，不滅胡寇，誓不回朝，收復我中原直搗賊巢，斬草除根不輕饒！全國同胞心一條，死裏求生眞榮耀，要知國破家亡身安在，同心合力把國保」！</p>

<p>— 梯公</p>
<p>溫如玉一劇，前年在移風劇社上演的時候，曾一連演了四十二天，我看了也不下十餘决，觀衆的輿論，相當的美滿，然而那時我感覺得有點奇怪，道是一支大悲劇，爲什麼找看了這許多决，並不曾爲牠流過一滴眼淚，雖然在讀劇本的時候，我確曾動過情感，而當時担任在全劇高峯裏佔最重要的位置的—金鐘兒，她的表演技巧，又相當的熟練豐富，像已做到了我們所要期望的一切</p>
<p>今年掃墓節的白天，移風社父寫過一回溫如玉，我看了以後，忽然的的束不住自己的情感起來，於是寫了一點感想，接着的下一個星期的白天，移風又貼這支戲，我問信芳，擱了許久的冷戲，爲什麼忽而要連翻兩决，信芳笑說，這是胡君特煩的，大概他也看到了我這篇東西，可是這一天的成績，倒確實是自演溫如玉以來之所未有，在金鐘兒跟如玉別院的一塲高峯裏，滿院的太太小姐們的手帕，如雪花般飛舞，就連先生們的手指，也很忙碌的在背着人偷了牠彈去一絲淸淚。</p>
<p>道一個對比，使我深切感覺到一個演員，僅僅倚仗她或他的技巧是不够的，一定要體味到劇作者的心理，在上演的時候，忘了自己，把劇作者在劇本裹所鑄裂的角色的靈魂，放進自己的軀殼裏，使自己完全變成了這某一偭角色，這樣才可以引起台下的共鳴，這樣才可以算是藝術家Artist，如果只有技巧而沒有靈魂，充其量也不過是一個藝術匠Artisan，這一决溫如玉之所以成功，就因爲台上的金鐘兒，她已經把金姐的靈魂放進了自已的軀殼裏。</p>
<p>如果有看了溫如玉則不曾流過眼淚的，有機會不妨再去溫一次，順便可以參證技巧和靈魂對於戲劇效果所發生的重一大的影響。</p>

<p>我問她在那裏演戲的情形怎樣，她說：「最初半個月很好，下半個月就差了，就是粵劇在那裏，最多也祇演到了十天，沒有一個月這麼久的。一我父問：「拜梅先生以後，替　說些什麼戲？」她回答說：「老師時常來看戲，看後就隨時指點，什麼地方應該怎樣唱或怎樣做。」說到這裏，她給我看一張梅蘭芳畫了送給她的一梅花，上面題着「熙春問業於余，以行將北歸，索余畫寫此貽之」幾個字，最後，她笑着吿訴我，在香港每天學畫，曾畫了不少梅花送人。</p>

<p>— 辛</p>
<p>進攻荷印是外交上的試探　英美監視下決無成功可能　上進的夢幻</p>
<p>日本南進政策的口號喊出來已有好多年了，這口號並沒有確定的　義，只表示着一個怪誕的幻想。這幻想的起因，有人認爲是由於日本　軍想借此提高牠的地位，可是這並不與日本陸軍的幻想相左，陸軍所抱的幻想，本巳奇誕，橫斷中國北部而出波斯，橫斷中國南　而出印度，是早在牠們的一向情的杓算內的。前　打算，多少還曾受國際的　，但這在大亞洲夢中，是　條更遙遠更艱難的路，現在繼續走下去的希望，愈過愈少，因而夢的這一部份，實際恐已經不再延續。後一打算，進則成爲推動海軍南進的力源，退則不失爲支助海軍南進的聲援，道似還有時機可以等待，而在等待期中，先施放海軍南進的空氣作試</p>
<p>德國與日本</p>
<p>試探的目標，是在解決牠應當加入歐洲交戰團體上那一方面。表面的，素被視爲海上强國的日本，在兩面之間，應有舉足重輕的地位，牠應該可以造成時機，而不必僅等待時機，可是事實上兩面連讓他表示一點態度的時機也不給，牠已幾乎降到無是申輕的地位，因而他終於只有等待。德國將進攻荷蘭的消息，使荷屬東印度成爲間題，牠等待，第一個機會了，然而重心還繫於德國會不會進攻荷蘭，對這點德國似毫米覺有給日本以一點暗示的必要，而相反方面。德國或還感覺若因牠進攻荷蘭，而使荷印落入於日本或英國之手，要比留牠在中立的荷蘭的手裏，於自已更爲不利。德國進攻荷蘭的傳說，到這回已是第三次，前二决已知道是英法方面的宜傳，這次的仍是英法方面的宣傳，也很可能。如　，則日本所將利用的時機，只是英法方面所安排下的策略。英法想測騐日本加人德方的可能性，而日本已被測騐得並不敢明白表示這種傾向。雖然道也是留退步，但已够見乏力。</p>
<p>南洋錯綜關係</p>
<p>不僅日本會不會眞南進是在被試探中，進一步的能不能把他逼得後退的試探，似也在進行中，道角色另由美國担承着。日本要更南進才與英法發生衝突，而現在的南進程度，却巳包圍住菲列濱，自然美國的目標與英法略異。日本代管的密克羅內西亞，橫梗着檀香山與菲列濱的交通。尤其密克羅內西亞中的重要島嶼馬利亞納及帛琉，緊緊挾制着關島及雅浦島，是美國所永遠不能安心的。加上去年三月三十日，日本佔據中國南海中的團沙羣島，四月十八日，史伸展到連西沙在內，這些島嶼的意義，就純在可作海軍空軍的根據地，雖然牠們的離西貢，山打根是與離馬尼刺同樣地近，但菲列濱既近台　，又夾在密克羅內西亞及團沙羣島的地位，是比英法領地更見不利的。並且英法的防禦，只能以新加坡爲中心，對於馬來羣島的極東部份，如摩鹿加，新幾內亞等處，或竟不能兼顧，而日本却素注意道一方向，曾幾度提出收買荷屬新幾尼亞之　，巧取不　，或不免終行豪奪，那是更將造成四面包圍菲列濱之勢，這自然更是美國所不能不遏止的。</p>
<p>對美的試探</p>
<p>雖然中　海西岸是更好的目標，但新幾尼亞一帶的防禦力顯然要較弱，而翻地圖　看，這帶更接近日本代管地，更在日本的正南，澳洲的達爾文港就的與長崎同經度，亞得米爾港就的與東京同經度，日本向澳洲，幷不此向爪哇更遠，日本仍有轉向這一面的可能，向這面而牽入美國，自然將遇更大的困難，可是美國宜言後面預備着怎樣大的實力，仍是日本所想試探的。可是他不在這方面進行試探，這轉足證明牠的不敢向新加坡一面的南進。</p>
<h3 id="c121">荷印的前途　方企　是世界的寶藏　是進攻的目標　荷印往何處去 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>荷蘭和葡萄牙同是近代初期的重要殖民國家，到現代也同樣以小小的本土，領有廣大的殖民地，論本土，以葡萄牙爲大，論殖民地也以葡萄牙　廣，但論國力，則葡萄牙　不及荷蘭，這不同的由來，可說完全在於荷蘭保有世界上最富蔗的東印度羣島的原故。</p>
<p>美國與荷印</p>
<p>荷屬東印度的精華，父在爪哇（連瑪都拉）。爪哇的面積僅佔荷印全部的—七分之一，而居民則佔荷印全區十分之七，即面積五〇·七五二方哩，而人口四一·七一九，〇〇〇人。與中國浙江省相比，面　略等而人口則多浙江一倍，與英國英蘇兩島比，是人口略等，而面積只有英蘇二島的一半。北美的古巴，在形勢及　　十　和牠相似，面積有牠的十分之九，而人口只有牠的十分之一。所以古巴的進出口貿易　和爪哇相仿，而就生產量說，就　非爪哇之比。古巴已經是加勒比亞海的珍珠，爪挂的寳貴，簡直難以形容了。老羅斯福爲了古巴，不惜揭起美西戰爭，這史實也許在激　小羅期福的心，因而在現在德荷關係日見緊張聲中，美國已早在吹擂由美國保護荷印之說了。這事件的定局固然還遠著，但美國如果保護格林蘭，那末也就曾以同樣手段來對付荷屬東印度。</p>
<p>英國與荷印</p>
<p>另一面，英國對於表示保護的義勇心自不甘落後，也已經發表了宣言。荷關本身，則　言東印度自已，已儘有防護自己的力量。歷史的關係，使我們每覺得荷印離歐洲較近，但事實上倫　離巴打威　　萬哩，而洛桑磯離巴打威只有　千哩。洛桑磯離澳洲雪尼只有七千五白哩，而　　離　尼有一萬二千五哩。自然在實際爭奪的現象中，這一點的遠近之差是無關係的，但這很司成　美國認爲與牠們有深切關俘的理　。</p>
<p>日本與荷印</p>
<p>日本打着「亞洲人的亞洲」的口號，自然也在打着中意，可是他的對於這問題將如何着落，還不能下準確的估計。單對美國，牠是可以拿出爭保護權的姿態的，而對於英國，就還要考慮是小是得取聯合保護之名。自然事實上牠所能與競爭的對手，剛是相反，但在試探的局勢之下，運用的方法，就頗有不同。在牠一方面，英國的爭保護權，未曹不可解釋為以拒絕美國爲暗示對她的拉攏，而美國如對這不起多　的反應，她的空想確也就頗有不少時候可以延續，以迄英國無　顧及東方的時候</p>
<h3 id="c122">作為英帝　防禦要塞的馬來關島 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— 雨</p>
<p>在亞洲極南端介乎中國與印度之間的馬來半島，北自暹邊境南迄新加坡爲止，長的四百六十四英里，東自中國海西至麻六甲海中間，闊度沒有超過二百十六英里。雖其面積，在英帝國中，眞是渺乎其少，但在其政治組織上，却有三種不同的地位，例如新加坡，檳榔嶼馬六甲，及拉布安島，則爲英屬直轄的殖民地，統稱爲海峽殖民地。霹靂，雪蘭莪，森美蘭及彭亨則組成馬來聯邦，柔佛，吉打，吉靈打，丁加奴及玻璃市，則爲馬來屬邦，這許多地方，都以海峽殖民地的總督爲其長官。</p>
<p>英國的與馬來半島接觸，遠在一千六百年，到了一八二四年東印度公司的職員萊佛士與柔佛王國訂的，始逐漸成爲英國殖民地。一八九五年成立聯邦，其他五邦，雖沒有加入聯邦以內，但也在英國保護之下。經過百年經營，到了現在，馬來半島極南端而軍事上極占重要的新加坡，遂變爲世界十二大海港之一。它不但是防衛馬來亞半島的堡壘，並且也是澳洲　西蘭屬東印度的防浪堤。</p>
<p>馬來半　各地方政治首領，對於新加坡軍港的建設，也捐助很大。馬來聯邦，幾年以前曾捐助二百萬鎊，以爲建設海軍根據地之用。英前王喬治五世登極二—五周紀念的時候，柔佛的蘇丹父捐助五十萬　，即使最貧窮的吉靈打，也捐助兩萬鎊。總數達一百五十萬鎊。可見馬來半島的土著，也出了不小的力量呀。</p>

<p>— 鐘望舒</p>
<p>自歐風東漸以來，國人已習慣於近代合理的日常衛生手續，如刷牙一事，在今日已極普遍。牙刷爲刷牙主要用品，吾國初無是項出產，後因需量日增，舶來品則其價甚昂，廣東佛山梁日新日盛昆仲有鑒於斯，爰於民國紀元前三年集資試辦家庭手工製造牙刷廠於其故鄉，當時僅在鎭內昇平街租一狹小之市房爲發行所，因出品有「一手不拔，脫毛包換」之優　，故極得社會人士之樂用，慘澹經營，其　務遂得蒸蒸日上，以至於今，分廠遍設國內外，出品遠銷南洋歐美，成爲國產牙刷業之巨擘，梁氏昆仲克苦耐勞沉毅勇敢之精神，實爲其成功之因素，該廠自草創以至今日廣大之範圍，化經過足資從事日用品工業者之參考與楷模，故記者樂爲介紹於本刋。</p>
<p>簡史</p>
<p>民國紀元前　年設手工製造廠於佛山，產量不多，鼎革後銷路大暢，乃增加生產，以應國人之需要，並設分行於香港犬道中，，藉此向海外推銷出品，而使國貨謀一出路。民國九年三月，總經理粱日盛經理陳冰俠到滬，成立上海總行，同時在廣州增設製刷工廠，使各支行於推銷上得以源源供給。民國十四年，設機製牙刷總廠於西門局鬥路，自此以後，出品式樣翻新，精益求精，比之舶來，有過之無不及，截止八一三時，上海廣州香港佛山漢口蘇州，共有製刷廠四，發行所十五，工人以是爲生者五千餘名。</p>
<p>八一三後一部份工廠遷往內地，在漢口大智路創設新廠，漢口人會戰時，又西　重慶，在　陵江邊增設　六分廠。一至於上海西門及昆明路二　刷工廠，均於艱形勢下全部遷入租界，二十六年底，重建新總廠於徐家匯路A九七號，平均每日產刷一萬餘把。八一三前行銷遍及全國各省各埠，戰後則注重南洋及美洲，良以華僑愛用國貨，兼之外滙緊縮易向外人推銷，海外定單，已有求過於供之勢。營業數額，民國九年時年僅二萬餘元，今則已超過二百萬元，進展之　度，因此可見一般。</p>
<p>製造</p>
<p>一，原料製刷原料以牛骨與猪鬃爲最主要。牛骨吾國蜀，鄂，蘇，魯，粵諸省均有出產，平日足供需求，戰後則因運輸困難，原料驟感缺乏，現各牙刷廠所採牛骨，國貨之外，間亦用美產。猪鬃產自蜀，鄂，湘，滇，黔，粵諸省，而以蜀產爲最佳，現因國府統制出口，致原料成本飛漲至七倍以上，製刷成本，乃隨之增高。有以馬鬃製刷者，僅供回敎同胞之用，象鬃則因價昂極稀應用。</p>
<p>二，程序製刷程序，至爲複雜，經過手續，須十八决之多：一，定長，將不同長慶之牛骨截就刷柄所需要之長度，二，剖骨，將整塊牛骨剖成數塊，三，削骨，將剖就之牛骨加以削製，四，磨胚，將削過之牛骨磨成柄胚，五，打孔及水孔，即打穿毛之孔及洩水之孔，六，立孔，即將打就之孔加以整即，匕，磨頭，將柄頭磨成所需之式樣，八，磨頸，將柄頸磨成所需之式樣，九，開漕，將穿刷處開成水漕，十，打尼孔，就柄　開孔，十一，漂白消毒，將骨柄加以漂白及消毒，十二，磨光，將漂白後之刷柄加以上汕及磨光，十三，穿孔，將猪鬃穿上，十四，塞頭，將穿就之刷頭加以　理，十五，修　，將穿毛之綫加以整即，十六，切毛，將穿就之毛加以整理，成所需之高度及斜度，十七，夾板，將刷毛夾成分綫，十八，打印，打上鋼印標記，一支完全的牙刷於以完成。以上裂造程序一，至十三，均用機器，十四，至十八，則用人了，分工合作，製造至爲迅速，設全部皆用機器，更可節省時間人工。據該廠負責人談，定貨擠時，日夜製造，每天可出刷二萬餘支之多云。</p>

The Japanese attack on Maojin Ferry began on Thursday under the cover of heavy artillery fire. However, Chinese troops held firmly to their mountain positions.

<h3 id="e8">Foreigners' Views on the Reopening of Navigation on the Pearl River <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou. Regarding the reopening of navigation on the Pearl River today, the Guangzhou Foreign Chamber of Commerce recently issued a statement saying that this move seems to be a step in the right direction. However, after studying the detailed procedures for ship movement and cargo entry and exit, as well as the list of prohibited items, an accurate decision can be made on the value of this step. If these regulations and restrictions hinder the free movement of goods that could be obtained under the customs administration, the reopening of the Pearl River will be of little value to trade and navigation. It is incomprehensible why merchants must first apply to the Customs Supervisor for a permit before applying to the Customs Commissioner. This approach contradicts the established procedures for applying to transport goods and cannot be taken lightly. Furthermore, this move will increase unnecessary procedures and costs for merchants, causing frustrating delays. It should be understood that Guangzhou is a distribution center for goods entering and exiting, and the surrounding areas are mostly production and consumption areas. If the free movement of goods in the surrounding areas is restricted, there is no hope of restoring trade. The return of Whampoa and other ports in the Pearl River Delta to customs administration is also absolutely necessary for the normal operation of trade. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo. The Pearl River was opened today, allowing foreign general trade to pass through, as announced in the joint communiqué issued by the Japanese naval and land forces in Southern China on the 12th of this month. According to the communiqué, "The Japanese land forces in Southern China will, from April 20th, allow general trade to pass through to Guangzhou within the scope that does not hinder military operations."

<h3 id="e12">The Focus of the Pacific Problem <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>In the past week, those who have paid attention to the Pacific problem have placed their emphasis on the crisis in the Dutch East Indies. On the 15th of this month, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita declared after a special cabinet meeting that he expressed concern about any situation that could change the status of the Dutch East Indies. There are only two things in his heart; One is to comfort the depressed morale of the people in the country, showing that Japan still has the ambition and spare power to actively develop abroad; The second is to use this to measure the repercussions abroad - especially to spy on the reaction of the United States as a reference for promoting the Southern Advance strategy. US Secretary of State Hull adopted a solemn attitude and issued a lion's roar, issuing a statement on the 17th, saying: Any change in the status quo of the Dutch East Indies will damage the peace and security of the Pacific, which is not allowed by the treaty and is not allowed by the United States. With the strong national power of the United States as the backing of Mr. Hull's statement, Japan will inevitably have to retreat temporarily. Judging from the surface, the crisis in the Dutch East Indies will come to an end for the time being. However, the international situation is urgent, and Japan's desire for aggression is endless. If we say that the Pacific has been turned into a safe haven because of Mr. Hull's words, the problem is not so simple, and the situation is not so optimistic.</p>
<p>Japan today has not yet shown weakness in the international community and has not yet reduced its aggressive arrogance. What it relies on is nothing more than the navy. According to the latest survey, the comparison of the strength of the three major naval powers, Britain, the United States, and Japan, is as follows: The British fleet has a total of more than 2,050,000 tons of ships of all classes, of which those under construction account for slightly less than 720,000 tons; The US fleet has a total of about 1,750,000 tons, of which those under construction account for more than 470,000 tons; The Japanese fleet has a total of more than 1,007,000 tons, of which those under construction account for more than 260,000 tons. The British Navy is now concentrating all its efforts to cope with the European war, and the only ones competing in the Pacific are the United States and Japan. From a numerical point of view, the total tonnage of the US and Japanese navies is in a ratio of five to three; However, in terms of strength, although the United States has ten main battle ships, most of Japan's warships of all classes are new types, which is inevitable; Therefore, the strength of the five-to-three ratio is doubtful, but it cannot be concluded that Japan's navy is enough to overwhelm the United States in the Western Pacific, or that the US navy is no match for Japan. Modern warfare is a war of comprehensive national strength. The outcome depends not only on the level of military power, but also on the strength of the entire national strength, especially economic strength. Since Japan launched a full-scale war of aggression against China, it has been thirty-four months. The consumption of its military expenditure should not be less than 1.5 million yuan, and the casualties of its troops should not be less than one million people; And China's heroic resistance is now actively expanding. The so-called "China Incident" is a chronic disease in Japan. Is there any spare power to cope with the US-Japanese war? The United States, on the other hand, has the world's leading economic strength; Recently, the 963,000,000 USD Vincent supplementary shipbuilding bill has also been approved by the House of Representatives, and it is certain that it will be passed by the Senate; The plan to defend Guam has also been re-submitted to Congress by Chief of Naval Operations Stark. All of this is what Japan is jealous of and afraid of, but it has nothing to complain about. Limited by objective conditions, it is not able to win. Moreover, more than half of Japan's military supplies and resources depend on the United States; According to a survey by US Secretary of Commerce Hopkins, the United States supplies Japan with 56% of its heavy industry necessities, 40% of raw cotton, 40% of metals, 50% of machinery, and 65% of oil. Therefore, the implementation of economic sanctions by the United States is enough to control Japan's fate, and it can be seen that Japan's outward strength is empty.</p>
<p>Japan's national strength is so weak, but its ambition for aggression is endless. What we can say for sure is that as long as the aggressive ambition of the Japanese warlords exists, there will be no peace in the Pacific, and the history of the Far East for the past fifty years, which is full of blood and tears, is clear evidence of this. Japan's aggressive goals are to the north, from Korea to Manchuria, from Manchuria to Mongolia, and from Mongolia to all of China; To the south, from Ryukyu to Taiwan, from Taiwan to Hainan Island, and now it will go further and covet the Dutch East Indies. On February 11th last year, the day after the Japanese army invaded Hainan Island, President Chiang Kai-shek issued a speech, saying: "There are three most important strategic bases in the Pacific, Sakhalin Island in the north, Hainan Island in the west, and Guam in the east. … And it has been painstakingly trying to create a communication line between these three bases for more than 30 years." Then, Japan's coveting of the Dutch East Indies cannot be interpreted as an attempt to cut off the British-American connection, prepare to further seize Guam and the Philippines, take the lead, and control the United States; This is indeed the focus of the entire Pacific problem. The Japanese are taciturn, greedy, and resentful. They will not turn back until they are in a desperate situation, and the gradual decline of their national strength is enough to make their desire for progress and urgency even more acute. Haven't you heard what is said by the authoritative magazine "Diplomatic Times" and other magazines and newspapers? Their arrangements in Nanjing and the visit of the Abe mission to China are to control China and exclude Britain and the United States. In short, they can symbolize the Japanese warlords' continued aggressive invasion of the mainland. And what Foreign Minister Arita declared can be regarded as a sign that the Japanese warlords will launch a fierce offensive against the Pacific. It is unwise to raise a tiger and cause trouble. Judging from the recent expressions of the US authorities, their strength and perseverance have exceeded the norm, and they seem to have realized that it is not advisable to be lenient; However, if we say that this expression alone, without taking concrete actions, can stop the aggressor's ambition and eliminate the major problems in the Pacific, then the Japanese are not like that.</p>

<p>Nashville Ship. US Secretary of the Navy Edison declared last night that the US fleet is now prepared to act in any part of the world. Mr. Edison arrived at Maar Island after inspecting the Pacific naval exercises in Hawaii last week. When it comes to the Dutch East Indies issue, he said, "With the current strength of our navy, we are prepared to operate in any location in accordance with our national policy." He built a "very strong outpost" with the command and authority given by the Navy Department. He will ask Congress to increase the budget for kerosene and munitions to expand the scope of the current Pacific exercises. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington. The "New York Daily News" stated yesterday that the government's policy toward the Far East, especially the Dutch East Indies issue, will "include the seeds of a possible US-Japanese war." The newspaper intervened in the US government's policy of maintaining the status quo in the South Seas, saying, "If this is the State Department's policy on the East Indies, and Congress supports it, then we have no reason to object. Regardless of whether our country is right or wrong in war or possible war, this policy undoubtedly includes the seeds of a possible US-Japanese war. Once the Netherlands is invaded, Japan will definitely prepare to quickly seize the East Indies with its navy, and the United States will then feel the threat of war everywhere, and the fire may also involve the Philippines." Recently, it is believed in Congress that the US-Japanese commercial relationship and the long-pending embargo plan will be the weapons of the United States to respond to Japan's invasion of the Dutch East Indies. People in the State Department believe that these measures by the United States are enough to curb any attempt to disrupt the status quo in the South Seas. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome. The "Italian People's Daily" implied yesterday that the US fleet's exercises in the Pacific were for the US fleet to seize the Dutch East Indies in the event that the Netherlands was drawn into the vortex of the European war. When commenting on Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita's statement that Japan would not allow other countries to occupy the East Indies, the newspaper claimed that the Hague government hurriedly assured Japan that this assumption was impossible. But how can the Dutch government know the future, and the US main battle ships are currently sailing to the Pacific. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Washington. US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics Director Rear Admiral Towers told the Senate Naval Committee yesterday that since the outbreak of the European War, foreign countries, especially Britain and France, have ordered 7,000 aircraft from the United States, of which 3,000 have already been exported to foreign countries. By the end of this year, the number of aircraft produced in the United States will increase to 25,000 per year. He predicted that the final production speed of aircraft is 750 per hour. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington. The amount of war materials exported by the United States to Britain and France in March fell sharply, probably because Britain and France temporarily stopped purchasing to wait for the United States to approve their purchase of new types of aircraft. According to statistics released today, the value of war material export licenses obtained by France in March was only 500,000 yuan. However, the amount obtained by the British Autonomous Territory was very large, especially in Canada, valued at 15,750,000 yuan, almost all of which were aircraft. Australia purchased 1,600,000 yuan, and New Zealand approximately 2,000,000 yuan. The war materials actually exported by the United States in March totaled 17,500,000 yuan, of which those exported to Norway were valued at 1,000,000 yuan, mostly aircraft. In total, in the first three months of this year, the United States exported war materials worth 61,000,000 yuan. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Manila. Members of the Philippine Congress today rejected Japan's protest against the immigration bill to be adopted in the Philippines. The bill restricts the immigration of China and Japan to the Philippines to 500 people per year. A spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said yesterday that this bill is a discriminatory expression against Japan. Congressman Esgairel said, "This bill is inevitable. Japan seems to have a tendency to interfere in the interests of the Philippines." After passing three readings and being approved by President Quezon and President Roosevelt, this immigration bill can become law. Political circles say that approval is not a problem. Japanese immigration to the Philippines will be reduced by about 70% per year. (20th United Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Yonai, in a review of the global situation to Japanese journalists, stated that in the past few days, there has been talk of Italy joining the European war. However, the relationship between Germany, the Soviet Union, and Italy is very complex and subtle, and he does not believe Italy will act rashly. The United States is paying close attention to the gains and losses of U.S. involvement in the war. However, we should not make a rash judgment as to whether the United States will enter the war. Foreign Minister Arita's remarks regarding the Dutch East Indies are merely an expression of Japan's concerns. Japan has a mission to prevent the spread of the European war to the East. Ethically speaking, it is right and honorable for us to express this attitude. The U.S. Navy customarily holds exercises around April each year, and this year it will proceed as usual. There is nothing more to it. We do not need to believe the large-scale U.S. naval maneuvers have any connection to the establishment of the "new Chinese regime." The United States may intend to use this exercise for political purposes, but even so, the Japanese Navy does not feel threatened. Japan's position is one of non-threat and non-aggression. The war Japan is currently engaged in is no less than the war between England and Germany. However, the Japanese people still seem to lack the necessary spirit to cope with various hardships. The Japanese people have never had the experience of a long-term war, nor have they undergone the severe hardships experienced by European countries. Therefore, there is a phenomenon of difficulty in coping with the war situation. However, observing the current European war, the international situation is constantly changing. Therefore, in today's urgent situation, the Japanese people must have the determination and preparation to cope with any hardship. For this reason, the government must strengthen its policies, and all political parties should be especially serious in persuading the people to participate in the movement to shoulder the needs of the situation. Japan's current focus is the China Incident. The "new Chinese regime" has just been established and has not yet achieved any notable results. Japan should assist in creating this "new regime" in accordance with its predetermined policy. Chongqing is now making propaganda for a summer offensive. However, the Chinese coast is completely blockaded, and the Chongqing government lacks funds and raw materials. Therefore, there will eventually be a day when it cannot resist the "new regime." We must wait patiently. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e20">Supplementary Report of Chairman Chiang's Closing Remarks at the Fifth Session of the People's Political Council: Developing the Economy and Implementing Constitutional Government are Both Important Measures for Saving the Country <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing - At the closing of the Fifth Session of the People's Political Council, Chairman Chiang personally delivered a closing speech. The main points of its contents were published in various newspapers on April 11th, but they were only outlines. The official record of this closing speech has now been finalized, and a supplementary report is provided below. Vice-Chairman Zhang, fellow councilors, this session of the council is concluding today. This session lasted for ten days. Our councilors have worked diligently day and night. The government has submitted reports to this council, speaking without reservation. Fellow councilors have reviewed the government's implementation of contributions and offered opinions, speaking without reserve. We have been in harmony and cooperation, selfless and impartial. It can be said that this session was more substantial in spirit and more complete in results than the previous four sessions. Moreover, all the proposals of the session were directed at practical matters, with not a single one being empty and difficult to implement. This is the greatest progress of this council, giving great comfort to our fellow countrymen and greatly inspiring the soldiers and civilians of the country. This council is composed of the wise and talented people of the country. It can be said that it represents the public opinion of our national people. The more successful the session is, the stronger our army becomes. The government will fully accept and earnestly implement the review reports and proposals of the session. It is hoped that everyone will urge the people to work together to implement them. Looking back on the establishment of this council, nearly two years have passed. Our contribution to the country is indeed very great. The most important of these is the realization of spiritual unity. Since the establishment of this council, the whole country, from top to bottom, has been able to unite sincerely and truly concentrate will, unify actions, share life and death, and share weal and woe. The opinions of the government and the people have been closely connected. All the wise and talented people of the country can work together with one heart and one mind to fight the war and build the country. Second, the war policy has been implemented. At each session of the council, there has been a solemn expression of support for the major war policy, so that the people of the country have a unified goal, and all countries of the world have a clear understanding. In the past two years, no matter how difficult the war environment has been, the war policy has always been firm and unwavering. The consistent support of this council has had a great force. Third, a model of civil governance has been established. This is the hope that this chair offered at the first session, and we have fully achieved it in the past two years. We have completely abandoned all the shortcomings of past parliaments. Everything is open and public, and there is absolutely no acting emotionally. In China, from the Han and Tang Dynasties to the Song and Ming Dynasties, the biggest bad habit of the scholars and officials was to act on their own emotions, sacrificing the interests of the country and the nation. The Niu-Li faction in the Tang Dynasty, the Luo-Shu faction in the Song Dynasty, and the Donglin Society and Fushe Society in the Ming Dynasty all despised and excluded each other, stubbornly adhered to their prejudices, and disregarded the interests of the country and the nation. As a result, the will and strength could not be concentrated, and the country and the nation were in turmoil and danger. However, our current situation is completely different. As long as we mention the country, the nation, and the war, all individual or minority opinions can be completely resolved, and we can understand each other and seek reasonable solutions. This fully proves that the Chinese nation has become a modern and progressive nation. Moreover, I believe that China's progress has been as rapid as in recent years, and its future position in the world will surely surpass others. Today, as chairman, I review our past achievements, and I feel infinite glory. I am also convinced that this is a symbol of the bright future of our nation. Comprehensively observing, many cases were resolved in this session, and the entire focus was concentrated on three major points: first, to condemn the Japanese puppets; second, to develop the economy; and third, to implement constitutional government. These are all important measures for us at present, and they are also issues of concern to the people of the country. Now, this chair will describe and explain them one by one. First, condemn the Japanese puppets. On the second day of this session, the entire audience unanimously passed and issued a telegram denouncing the puppet organization. This is the most solemn expression of the public opinion of our entire nation. This clearly declares the firm determination of all Chinese people with blood and intelligence. This point is extremely important to the future of our war. Looking at the history of China in the past, whenever the country encountered foreign aggression and was in great difficulty, the most important thing was to make clear right and wrong and to distinguish between evil and righteousness. We are not afraid of the weakness of the country, nor are we afraid of the seriousness of foreign troubles. We are only afraid of the confusion of evil and righteousness and the obscurity of right and wrong. The dynasties that fell were not only because the scholars and officials competed for emotions and harmed the public for private interests, or lost all sense of shame and did not value integrity, but also because the general society was also confused about evil and righteousness, and did not distinguish between black and white, so that people's minds were numb and unknowingly fell into destruction. Everyone can read the History of the Song Dynasty. When the Jin soldiers crossed the Yellow River and invaded the south, they once said (there is really no one in the Southern Dynasty). We still feel pain, anger, and shame when we read this sentence today. At that time, the population of the Southern Song Dynasty after the southward crossing, although there are no accurate statistics now, was at least over 100 million people. The reason why the Jin people said that there was no one in the Southern Dynasty was because the national integrity was declining and the sense of shame was lost. Traitors such as Zhang Bangchang and Qin Hui only knew how to surrender to the enemy to seek peace, and did not know how to resist the war to seek survival. Therefore, people did not become people, and the country did not become a country. Therefore, even the very small Jin people dared to invade our dignified China, and even be defeated by him. From this, we can know that the most important thing in our current war is to promote national integrity, clarify the meaning of spring and autumn, and strictly distinguish between Yi and Xia. Now, the puppet organization vainly tries to reverse black and white and confuse people's minds. At this critical juncture, the entire council unanimously denounced it, which is to fulfill the responsibility of clarifying right and wrong and distinguishing between evil and righteousness. This force of righteousness makes the people of the country recognize the significance of loyalty and treachery not being compatible, and the enemy and us not coexisting. Strengthening our determination to resist Japan and eliminate traitors is more powerful than the force of one million troops. As long as the people of the country know that traitors and bandits must be punished, and the dignity of China must be protected, so that righteousness will always exist and justice will be manifested, any violent enemy will never be able to destroy China. Therefore, this solemn denunciation of the council is enough to make the Japanese lose their courage and the traitors lose their souls. But on the Japanese side, the Japanese warlords will never recognize the great spiritual power of the Chinese people today. The Japanese warlords have never recognized the times, nor have they recognized China. They are not only scheming, but also deaf and blind, and only vainly try to destroy China. They only know the history of the late Song and Ming Dynasties of China. They have studied in detail the methods by which the Yuan and Qing Dynasties destroyed the Song and Ming Dynasties, but they have not studied the history of the establishment of the Republic of China before and after. He does not even know how the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, how the Republic of China was established, and how the National Revolutionary Army carried out the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance. The Japanese warlords have completely ignored and do not understand this most important history. Moreover, he would not think of the Three Principles of the People, the highest principle of China's nation-building, and the great power of the National Revolution for thirty years. Everyone has recently read the newspaper, didn't Japan loudly clamor to send Abe Nobuyuki to be a disguised Governor-General of Korea? Why do they have to put on such an act and make such a fuss? It is because they themselves know that this is completely an act of (covering their ears to steal the bell). Therefore, he especially wants to embellish the show, thinking that it is a plan to deceive himself, but he does not know that he has caused such invasion and humiliation to China, which only intensifies the national consciousness of the Chinese compatriots, enhances the spirit of resistance, and deepens the irreconcilable hatred between China and Japan for generations. China today is not only like the Southern Song Dynasty, which was despised by the enemy as having no one. China is now concentrating the wise and talented people of the country, actively responsible, and unanimously resisting the war. Just talking about the spirit of the councilors today, who are united against the enemy, is enough to show that China not only has people, but also 50 million compatriots, who are all educated by national consciousness. The Three Principles of the People are all the incarnations of Xu Xilin, Wen Shengcai, Li Peiji, and Peng Jiazhen, the martyrs who revived the nation. Whoever wants to destroy China will be destroyed by China first. I can boldly say that China is now completely a believer in the Three Principles of the People, with principles, determination, and plans. China is really not afraid of not having people. Looking back at the situation in Japan today, some people have tasted and said "Japan really has no one". This sentence is not only often said by foreigners, but also by the Japanese themselves who have publicly and unscrupulously said "Japan is really unmanned". But in my opinion, it can only be said that his current politicians have no backbone and no vision. His soldiers have no martial virtue. Just look at him since (September 18), the statement of Konoe Fumimaro (New Order in East Asia) before the year, and even the secret agreement (New Sino-Japanese Relations) signed by Kagesa Sadaki and Wang Jingwei at the end of last year. Until this spring, Abe Nobuyuki was sent to China, vainly trying to relive his old dream of destroying Korea, we can know that Japanese politicians and soldiers are really greedy, cruel, and arrogant, deceiving themselves. They have no brains and no backbone. People without this kind of backbone are in charge of everything, which is tantamount to no one. Everyone, look at Abe's fate, what will be the result in the future? His visit to China this time not only proves that Japan (unmanned), but also fundamentally the entire Japanese country, has completely failed. Therefore, it can be proved that China has completely laid the foundation for its revival through this war of resistance, and the guarantee for the entire liberation of the East Asian nation lies entirely in this.

That evening, they arrived at Zhongxin Township in Lianping County, where they summoned the local district chief and the director of the tax bureau to inquire in detail. On the 18th, after passing through Longchuan County, it was discovered that Huang Fu, the patrol officer of the first district of the county, had neglected his duties and misled the public. He was immediately dismissed. Huang Yingcai, the police officer of the county, was given a major demerit for failing to supervise effectively. Then, a meeting of local government officials was called, and Chairman Li and Commissioner Lu successively gave instructions, encouraging all officials to fulfill their duties and abide by the law, and to be self-disciplined and honest. Li and Lu sought out the people's grievances along the way, and paid close attention to the diligence and laziness of the officials. (Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>The "Electric News" in The Hague recently reported that Soviet Ambassador to Germany, Shkvartsev, has returned to his post in Berlin after a three-week vacation in his home country. According to well-informed sources, Ambassador Shkvartsev brought with him a note from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, explaining the Soviet view on the solution of various issues in the Balkans. Judging from various signs, the three countries of Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union all want to eliminate the influence of Britain and France in the Balkans and divide the spheres of influence there. Generally, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary are included in the space vital to Germany's survival, Yugoslavia and Greece are controlled by Italy, and Turkey is controlled by the Soviet Union. At this time, the German authorities are optimistic that Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union can reach a concrete agreement, and telephone contacts between Berlin and Rome are becoming more frequent.

<p>Rome - Although satisfaction has been expressed here with British Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement on Thursday that Britain wants to maintain peace in the Balkans, responsible political figures have expressed great skepticism about the meeting of British ambassadors to the Balkan countries in London. It is claimed that Italy has prevented the spread of war to the Mediterranean and the Balkans through diplomatic action. Therefore, this part of Europe is not threatened by Germany and Italy. Then, what kind of danger does Britain want to use the plans already studied in the London Church meeting to deal with? It is really incomprehensible. Italy has already explained its position on the Balkans, the Danube River, and the Mediterranean region, and will now decide to defend it against any sudden attack. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>Rome - A machine newspaper of Prime Minister Mussolini is titled, "Critical Moment of Decision," advocating that "the Italian people must take action." "The Italian People's News" recently published an article stating, "The Italian nation is now at a historical crossroads, and its position is in the center of the war zone. It cannot stand by and watch for long, so as to be caught between two enemies in the future. In other words, a great nation like ours cannot allow others to supervise or control its internal activities. For example, if we want to go from the port of Trieste in our country to the port of Massawa in East Africa, that is, from Italy to Italy, we must be blocked, questioned, checked, and even ordered to stop, which not only violates the dignity of an independent country, but also hinders the transportation of all easily corrosive goods. Ordinary criminal law prohibits arbitrarily checking others in broad daylight. To this day, our country has been deprived of the protection of this ordinary criminal law by others. Under this violent measure, our country may be strangled to death. On the other hand, a great position requires space. All great nations in the world have direct access to the ocean, but only our Italy does not. From this point of view, the freedom enjoyed by our country is not even as good as Portugal. How can it be said to be fair? Prime Minister Mussolini once said that in order to eliminate the fate of our nation as a prisoner of the Mediterranean, we will not hesitate to make special sacrifices. How wonderful is this statement. We deeply know that the bayonet is more important than gold, and we know even more that anyone who is unwilling to take risks or despise life cannot maintain his position. Therefore, we should not resent the iron and blood mission given to us by fate, because there is no construction without destruction." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Italian Naval and Air Force Power Should Not Be Underestimated</p>
<p>Rome - Military figures here recently said that the air force is in an important position in the Norwegian war. Italy's air force is comparable to the most powerful countries and is not inferior at all. "The Italian People's News," a machine newspaper of Prime Minister Mussolini, also stated that the war situation in the North Sea is of great significance to Italy. From this, it can be seen that the naval power of a country is not based on the total tonnage of the fleet, but should take into account the entire naval and air force and its bases. For this reason, the so-called naval country has ceased to exist and has become a naval and air force country. Italy in the Mediterranean is like a huge aircraft carrier and is a strong naval and air force country. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Rome - British Minister of Economic Warfare Cross spoke on Wednesday, saying that if Italy wants other countries to treat it as a neutral country, its actions must be within the scope of a neutral country. Gedda, the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, wrote an article today in response, saying that although Cross's words were declared by the British semi-official spokesperson that there was no reason to attach excessive importance to them, some newspapers in London published this article under intolerable and bizarre titles, stating that Italy does not need to be taught by others how to rectify its behavior, nor can it accept warnings from others. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Rome - Italian newspapers continued to criticize Britain and France today. "Fascist System News" stated, "British and French newspapers have been commenting on Italy's attitude for days. In short, what they want is for us to transform the resentment we had when the League of Nations imposed sanctions on our country into love. In other words, they hope that we will love the people who wanted to starve our nation. How is this possible? Forgiveness without knowing the way can easily be mistaken for cowardice or weakness. This is something that will never be done in Fascist Italy. Even from the perspective of national interests, our country does not need to fight alongside the jailers of our enemies. Wouldn't it be better if the French newspapers praised the victory of the Anglo-French Allied Forces? In fact, Germany has achieved absolute success so far, and Italy and Germany have concluded an alliance treaty, which Britain and France must not forget." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>

General Walter von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Admiral Raeder, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, and General Goering, Minister of Aviation, respectively issued statements declaring that the national army, navy, and air force are loyal to the leader and trust the leader. General Goering also said, "The best gift our air force can present to the leader is to devote all our strength to realizing our goals, even if we go through fire and water, we will not hesitate. This is the case now, and it will be the case in the future." Minister Hess then delivered a speech to the National Socialist Youth League, saying, "Germany can obtain colonies at the end of the war. You, at this moment, cannot fight with weapons due to age, then you can only work for the colonies at that time to develop your talents. In short, the path opened up by Leader Hitler is a brave path.

<p>Berlin - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels broadcast a speech last night on the eve of Hitler's 51st birthday, saying that the German people may have different opinions on some events, but their respect, love, obedience, and trust in Hitler are unanimous and without the slightest difference. This is the strongest armed force to protect the country in the current war on which Germany's survival depends. We are now facing difficult trials. The new type of war does not rely solely on weapons, but also relies on the economic front and, more importantly, on the front of striving for the national soul. The propaganda of plutocratic Britain against the German people is completely ineffective. The German people will never accept orders, advice, or encouragement from Britain. Now the whole country has gathered its entire strength, and the front line and the domestic front line have been united. No one utters a complaint, and no one utters a doubt. Although we all have our own things to do, our wishes are the same, that is, to wish Hitler a long life and lead us to achieve a glorious German victory. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e29">Anglo-Turkish Talks: Exchange of Views on the Balkan Situation <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>London - The British Foreign Secretary met with the Turkish Ambassador Aras yesterday afternoon. It is widely believed that they exchanged views regarding intelligence on Italy's attitude towards Britain and France. Both British and Turkish officials have remained silent on this discussion, but diplomatic circles consider it particularly important, believing that this discussion may lead Turkey to immediately state its position should Italy take any action in Yugoslavia or the Eastern Mediterranean. Well-informed sources in the Balkans believe that Greece would welcome a strong Turkish army entering Greece to resist any invader of the Balkans. British figures now believe that Italy may not risk launching a major war at this time. It is reported that Britain and Turkey have already planned thoroughly for any possible situation. Knowledgeable Balkan diplomats believe that if Italy attacks Dalmatia, Bulgaria will assist Yugoslavia, and neutral observers also state that if Italy invades Yugoslavia, Turkey will also provide assistance.

<p>London - Political figures here recently stated that German leader Hitler is currently pursuing a policy of expanding the war. Because the group lacks material resources and cannot conduct a long-term war, it intends to invade many parts of Europe in order to plunder various resources. Under these circumstances, Germany may deploy troops to "protect" neighboring countries already in the "most dangerous situation," as it did with Denmark and Norway. Therefore, all small countries are uneasy. As for the Netherlands, taking Norway as a lesson, in addition to strengthening its national defense, it has also taken various preventive measures to cope with the domestic crisis. As for the countries of Southeastern Europe, according to reliable sources, Germany has recently deployed several more divisions near the Hungarian border. There are rumors that the country has also been mobilizing troops on the Yugoslav border, but this is not reliable. Political figures say that if Germany takes any action towards Hungary, Italy will definitely follow, seeking a new sphere of influence. The Italian government seems to be creating public opinion in preparation for abandoning its non-intervention policy in the future. Although the British government recently inquired about Italy's true intentions through diplomatic channels, the results were still difficult to reassure people. Therefore, the British Ambassador to Italy, Loraine, may soon ask the Italian government to clearly state its attitude, and also inform it that if it takes interventionist action against its neighbors, it will cause severe consequences. According to well-informed sources, the greatest threat is currently to Yugoslavia. As for Turkey, regardless of what happens in the Mediterranean, the country will absolutely adhere to the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and Turkey. In short, Britain continues to implement the same policy towards all threatened small countries, that is, if these countries request protection from Britain and France, it will immediately provide it, but will never force these countries to accept protection.

<p>London - Official sources recently stated that Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky yesterday and immediately informed him that the British government is willing to accept the Soviet proposal and prepare to negotiate the basis for bilateral trade talks. According to well-informed sources, what Britain and the Soviet Union should negotiate is a "wartime trade agreement," the content of which takes into account wartime needs and is generally the same as those concluded by Britain with various neutral countries. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>London - Authoritative sources here last night reported that the British government notified the Soviet Union yesterday that it had, in principle, accepted the Soviet Union's recent request to start Anglo-Soviet trade negotiations. Soviet Ambassador Maisky was invited to visit Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday, and the Foreign Secretary clearly stated that he must obtain a firm guarantee from the Soviet side regarding trade with Germany, especially regarding Soviet exports to Germany. Informed circles say that Britain is clearly going to discuss with the Soviet Union the transport of important raw materials to the Soviet Union and British-made machinery to the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union must guarantee that these raw materials are not re-exported to Germany. Neutral parties believe that this move by Britain may loosen the economic bloc between Germany and the Soviet Union. (United Press, 20th)</p>

<p>Belgrade, Yugoslavia - Former Yugoslav Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović was arrested today and will be imprisoned in Rutnik Castle. It is noted that former Prime Minister Stojadinović is a well-known pro-German figure and has always opposed the Soviet Union. This matter may be related to the government's intention to approach the Soviet Union. In addition, the government also searched the residences of most of former Prime Minister Stojadinović's political friends, immediately finding various propaganda materials attacking the current government's internal affairs. (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>According to reports, Mr. Stojadinović is known throughout Yugoslavia as the "savior of the Dinar" because when he was Minister of Finance from 1922 to 1926, he not only curbed the decline of the Dinar but also increased its exchange rate against the Swiss Franc, and also stabilized the Dinar during the unprecedented and rapid fluctuations in the currencies of major European countries.

<p>Stockholm, Sweden - British expeditionary forces have made first contact with German troops in the town of Grong, near Trondheim, Norway. In addition, a food panic has broken out in Oslo, which is quite serious, especially with meat being the most scarce. (Havas News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - Military experts here recently stated that British troops landed yesterday at Namsos, north of Trondheim, Norway. This move has a great impact on the war situation, because (1) the German forces in northern Norway have been completely cut off from their rear bases, making development very difficult, and (2) after landing, the British forces should rapidly attack the weaker areas of German defenses. Both of these points are unfavorable to the German forces. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin - According to news from the border, German forces have occupied Hamar, 99 miles from Oslo, and have reached a point 40 miles north of Kongsvinger. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>London - There is news that Canadian expeditionary forces have landed in Langste Bay, Norway. Informed sources have commented that if this news is proven to be true, then a major battle will occur 160 miles southeast of Hamar. As for the critical situation in western Norway, Allied forces are now in contact with the advance troops of the German forces led by Colonel Weiss (who came to guard Trondheim) in Namsos and Steinkjer. Generally, a major battle will occur in the vicinity of Steinkjer. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden - According to indirect news here, the situation in the Trondheim area seems to be developing into a battle. The Norwegians in the area have been fully mobilized and armed, and are now concentrated in Steinkjer, 60 miles north of Trondheim, and have made contact with the Allied forces landing in Namsos, Molde, and Rauma (75 miles into the Sogneg Inlet). The Norwegian forces south of Trondheim have also made contact with the Allied forces. German forces are currently setting up defenses around Trondheim, and it is expected that battles will also occur 20 miles south of the city, between Okdal and Kvaal. According to a Reuters military correspondent, Elverum is an important junction for northern transportation. Since the fall of Kongsvinger, German forces have been meeting resistance from Norwegian rear guards who are destroying bridges and laying mines along the way with every inch of advance. When German forces tried to cross the Glomma River, Norwegian guerrillas destroyed the gates upstream, flooding the German forces. 120 German soldiers were lost. If the report that Canadian troops landed at the mouth of Langste Bay, 160 miles southeast of Hamar, is confirmed, then a fierce battle is expected to occur rapidly in that area. The strength of the Allied forces in Norway has not yet been confirmed. One report says that there are about 50,000 troops in total, including two British divisions and one French division. The first German troops to land in the Trondheim area numbered 1,200, and later about 2,000 more arrived by plane. However, their numbers are relatively weak, and they are expected to fight a defensive battle. It is heard that German troops along the railway have been recalled, and it is also expected that German forces will send small teams to launch surprise attacks to prevent Allied forces from advancing south from Namsos. It is heard that 400 German soldiers who landed on thick ice six miles east of Namsos have already engaged in combat with the Allied forces, and fresh troops have arrived. Refugees fleeing from Narvik often arrive here exhausted after traveling on snowshoes. According to them, men and women leaving Narvik are prohibited.

<p>London - A senior official of the Norwegian government arrived here this month after many transfers to reveal the details of the country's invasion by Germany and the current situation of resistance. (The details discussed should be included in the Norwegian government's White Paper.) It shows that Germany had carefully prepared for a long time before carrying out the invasion. It is said that he witnessed the German fleet forcing Norwegian fishing boats and cargo ships to lead the way into Trondheim Harbor. The Norwegian batteries were unable to fire because they feared injuring the innocent, and because it was dawn and the line of sight was not clear, it was difficult to aim. Some parties accused several officers of the batteries of treason, but in fact, it is difficult to judge before the country is completely liberated and thoroughly investigated. At this moment, the legitimate government has moved to a safe location and completely controls the free zone. Mobilization in the free zone is proceeding as usual. King Haakon VII was repeatedly attacked by German planes in Hamar, Elverum, and Nybergsund, and he also witnessed it. Now the king has moved to a safe location, the specific name of which cannot be disclosed. As for the former puppet government of Quisling and the newly established administrative committee in the occupied area, they are all nominal. The chairman of the committee, Christianson, and the members initially refused to organize a puppet regime under German supervision, and two members of the Quisling government mistakenly believed it to be the legitimate government, so they cooperated with Quisling. They immediately resigned upon learning the truth. (Havas News Agency, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e50">Trend of Roosevelt's Re-election as US President <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The two major parties in the United States, the Democratic and Republican parties, have been actively holding primaries in various states to select candidates for the next presidential election. Within the Democratic Party, there seems to be a tendency to nominate Roosevelt for a third term. This movement can only be stopped if President Roosevelt himself says "no." However, Democratic Party officials believe that President Roosevelt will not express his approval or disapproval for several weeks and will not suppress this movement at this time. Therefore, the party has already drafted an election campaign plan and intends to request Roosevelt's consent when the party's national committee meets on July 15th.</p>
<p>The first step is to hold a presidential primary in New Hampshire on March 12th to generate a delegation that supports Roosevelt and to promote the campaign. Then, on April 2nd, a presidential primary will be held in Wisconsin to obtain the support of the Progressive Party, which supports Roosevelt, and defeat Vice President Garner, who has joined the race. A week later, the Democratic Party in Illinois will hold a primary. Because the powerful groups led by Kelley and Nash, as well as Governor Horner, are enthusiastically supporting Roosevelt's re-election for a third term. After the results of the Wisconsin and Illinois primaries are revealed, Vice President Garner will know when to withdraw. Primaries in Oregon and California are scheduled for May. Party officials in both states also support Roosevelt's re-election for a third term. After the results of the primaries in these states are revealed, those who want to promote Senator Wheeler as a candidate in the western states can abandon all intentions of campaigning in the West.</p>
<p>The officials who support Roosevelt's re-election for a third term also plan to unite many delegations appointed by the Democratic Party conventions and Democratic Party executive committees in various states to strengthen their momentum. They believe this will be easy to accomplish because most of the officials in various states are already in the third-term movement camp. No one doubts this prediction. With the election campaign in this situation, only Roosevelt's definite statement that he does not want to run again can stop this movement. However, even so, the so-called third-term movement faction can still carry out its planned activities or overcome this difficulty.</p>
<p>Roosevelt is not expected to comment on the election issue for the time being, and there are several events that support this belief. The most important of these is that Roosevelt has remained silent about the primary situation in Illinois. His name has been used as a candidate in the state's primary list. He has neither publicly approved it nor asked for it to be removed. Why Roosevelt allows his name to remain on the ballot is intriguing. Some say that Roosevelt himself is actively campaigning in secret, or that Roosevelt is consolidating his power and, when the time is right, will recommend someone as a presidential candidate to concentrate his power and promote their election.</p>
<p>Another theory is that Roosevelt's dispatch of Secretary of State Welles to Europe is to reserve room for maneuver. He will only be able to express his real opinion on the question of whether he is willing to run for a third term after reviewing Welles' report. The issue of war and peace in Europe is inextricably linked to American politics. President Wilson knew this when he ran in 1916, and President Roosevelt is no outsider. He once revealed in a casual conversation at the White House that although he does not seek to cling to power for four more years, if the European war intensifies, he has an undeniable responsibility to continue in office to keep the United States from being drawn into the whirlpool. Lindley also quoted Roosevelt's remarks in his biography of Roosevelt, saying, "I am a little tired and don't want to run again. It is time for someone else to take over. But if the German army defeats Britain and threatens the United States with the momentum of victory, I cannot promise to leave office." From this, one can think about who the next president of the United States will be. (Translated from New York Times, New York Herald Tribune)</p>

<p>(Yong'an Correspondence) The Fujian Department of Education recently received an order from the Ministry of Education to implement temporary measures for mobilizing intellectuals nationwide to handle public education. Considering that the province has been lacking teachers to promote national education, it would be greatly beneficial to mobilize intellectuals to assist in handling it. After drafting six supplementary measures, they were approved by the Provincial Government Committee and decided to first conduct pilot programs in Yong'an County and other counties, and then promote them universally after achieving results. The measures are extracted below: (1) Each county district should have an overall plan for mobilizing intellectuals to handle public education, so that the result of the mobilization can compensate for the shortage of local teachers. (2) Before the mobilization, a survey of the intellectuals in each county district should be conducted and statistics compiled in preparation for conscription. (3) Intellectuals in each county district who are already serving in national schools and central schools are not subject to conscription. (4) All intellectuals who are to be conscripted should be assigned to adult classes or women's classes in nearby national schools and central schools to teach. (5) Counties and districts with a large number of national schools and sufficient teachers may allow a portion of the conscripted intellectuals (county government or district office staff) to serve as supervisors. (6) For the convenience of teaching and to supplement the current lack of investigation, the service time of the conscripted intellectuals (at least 156 hours per year) may be concentrated within six months, so that they can specialize in teaching one term at one school.</p>

<p>(Chongqing Airmail) In order to improve the work efficiency of public education centers in various provinces, the Ministry of Education previously organized a training class for directors of public education centers in various provinces. The first class was completed at the end of February. The second class continues to be organized, and students recommended by the education departments of various provinces, such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Hubei, and Xikang, began school on March 25 and classes on March 28.

<h3 id="e55">Current Situation of Secondary Education in Sichuan Province Reported by Provincial Inspector Zhang Dengshou <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(Chengdu Airmail) Provincial Inspector Zhang Dengshou reported on secondary education in Sichuan Province, as follows: (1) The secondary education in Sichuan is progressive in terms of quantity. The funding in 1939 increased by 48% compared to 1935, the number of classes increased by 100%, and the number of students increased by 211%. Currently, there is funding of 5,144,738 yuan, 309 schools, 1,874 classes, and 100,977 students. However, in terms of the distribution of quantity, the distribution of secondary, vocational, and normal schools is unbalanced, and the distribution is not very even. (2) The strengths of secondary schools are that teachers have a strong sense of respecting teachers and valuing education, and they can work hard despite meager treatment. Students are able to endure hardship and are extremely simple in nature. In terms of school administration, some schools have strict organization and planning. (3) The shortcomings of secondary schools are that some teachers have not yet been certified as qualified, and some lack a good service spirit. Some students have a poor foundation and have poor living habits. In terms of school administration, there are no proper methods for making finances public, and many new and old principals have failed to handle the handover seriously. In terms of education, the teaching progress has not been carried out according to standards, and there are many areas in teaching that need to be studied and improved. In terms of training, physical punishment has not been completely abolished, the tutor system has not been fully implemented, and students do not have a definite organization for self-government. (4) The urgent problems to be solved in secondary education in the future are to adjust distribution and allocation, increase funding, increase compensation, enrich equipment, cultivate teachers, carefully enroll students, improve teaching, and strictly train students. In the future, normal schools and vocational schools should be established as much as possible to shift the social trend of people favoring general secondary schools.</p>

<p>The Jingwu Cup Individual Table Tennis Tournament was held in the club's billiard room at 7:00 PM last night for the elimination round of Group Eight. The seeded player in this group was Zhang Ying, the runner-up of the previous tournament. After Zhang improved his rubber racket, his chops became more powerful. He first defeated Liang Huacheng, then Chen Xuelin, showing his prowess. Zhou Weixin, a veteran nicknamed "Red Nose," was trapped in a fierce battle with the newcomer Li Zhen, who was good at chopping, in the semi-finals. The two fought fiercely for five rounds, and Zhou narrowly defeated Li Zhen 3-2 and reached the final with Zhang Ying. Zhou was very experienced, but before the battle, he had a fear of Zhang. He once took the lead with 11-1 in the first game, but could not get another point, losing the chance to win. His spirit was greatly frustrated. After a fierce battle with Li Zhen, he had no strength to pull the ball and was physically exhausted. Zhang defeated him with three straight sets. Today is the elimination round for the last two groups. Group Nine will be held at 2:00 PM, and the referees will be Zhao Suijia and Zhu Lianxiang. Group Ten will start at 7:00 PM, and the referees will be Zhu Kuicheng and Wang Huizhang. Tickets are two cents per person.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Weekend Floating Profits Dwindle, Gold Market Continues to Weaken, Falling Below the 5,800 Yuan Level <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was dull, with few bright spots. Prices were generally weak, and the instability of the trend made ordinary operators wary, making it difficult to determine direction. Both bulls and bears awaited a clearer market outlook, and dared not act rashly. The morning started high, with an opening price of 5,810 yuan, but due to the selling pressure from gold shops and a lack of buyers due to the weekend, the price quickly fell back after a brief hold. Later, currency exchange firms and securities houses bought in, pushing the price up again, but it only struggled around the 5,815 yuan level. Soon after, many floating longs, due to urgent silver needs, rushed to sell at limit prices. Securities houses attempted to absorb these sales, but ultimately found it unsustainable, and the price fell below the 5,800 yuan mark to 5,780 yuan. Later, currency exchange businesses and gold shops saw the low price and stepped in to buy, pushing the price back to the 5,800 yuan level. However, as the closing time approached, buyers disappeared, and currency exchange businesses suddenly resumed selling, resulting in a final price of 5,790 yuan, down 16 yuan from the previous evening's closing price. There was no trading in the afternoon due to the weekend, and little activity was heard of outside the market. The turnover for the day was meager, approximately 1,700 taels. Gold ornaments at silver shops remained unchanged, and customs gold remained stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Down 16 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the initial opening price per bar (ten taels) was encouraging. One silver firm showed strong buying interest, pushing the opening price up slightly by 4 yuan. Silver firms, currency exchange businesses, and others bought several dozen taels at 5,810 yuan. Subsequently, gold shops, currency exchange businesses, and others sold off, and the silver firm stopped buying, causing the price to fall back 8 yuan. Gold shops sold ten taels to securities houses at 5,802 yuan. Later, securities houses bought vigorously, and a currency exchange business also competed to buy, creating a strong upward trend, with the price rising again by 13 yuan. Currency exchange businesses sold thirty taels to silver firms at 5,815 yuan. However, buyers gradually decreased, and floating longs saw an opportunity to sell, causing the price to fall again. Shortly after, silver firms, currency exchange businesses, and others competed to sell, causing the price to retreat below the 5,800 yuan mark. Silver firms sold twenty taels to securities houses, but only at 5,780 yuan. Afterward, both buying and selling decreased, and the market was relatively quiet for a time. Around 11 o'clock, buying picked up suddenly. Gold shops repeatedly bought, and currency exchange businesses followed suit, causing the situation to become tense. The price returned to the 5,800 yuan mark. Silver firms traded thirty taels with each other at 5,808 yuan. Unexpectedly, after 11:30, floating longs saw an opportunity to sell again, and currency exchange businesses also shifted to selling, causing the price to fall back below the 5,800 yuan mark again. Silver firms sold several dozen taels to gold shops at 5,790 yuan, as the closing price for the morning session. As a result, the price was down 16 yuan from the previous day. The price fluctuated by 35 yuan during the morning session. The selling price of spot gold by gold shops was several yuan higher than the spot price, while the buying price was 20 yuan lower. The current premium for gold certificates was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and trading was minimal.</p>
<p>Price of Gold Ornaments Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments at silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang continued to offer the original price of 585 yuan per tael. The new firms had the same selling price, but the buying price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Foreign Currency Market Increasingly Quiet <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market was even more quiet, mainly due to tight credit conditions and the weekend, leading to a wait-and-see attitude. The trend for British and American gold continued to be weak, with market prices falling by 5 jiao each. British gold notes fell back by 1 jiao, while American gold notes remained fluctuating within a narrow range, with the evening price still at 16.55 yuan. Hong Kong notes and French franc notes saw little change. Canadian notes showed a weak trend, with the price falling by 5 fen. Japanese gold notes fell and then recovered to their original level, with the evening price still at 1.305 yuan. Korean notes were in ample supply, and the market price continued to decline, with the evening price at 1.025 yuan. The rest remained unchanged.</p>

<h3 id="e64">Securities Market Tight Credit, Domestic Bonds Sold Off <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The securities gray market experienced a worsening decline yesterday, with various factions selling off. The underlying cause was the pressure from extraordinarily tight credit conditions. Many were forced to sell to raise cash for working capital, in order to maintain their operations, leading to a gradual decline in market prices. Moreover, due to the end of the quarter, financial institutions mostly only took money in and didn't lend it out. Therefore, it was difficult for the market to improve this month. The high interest rates and the flight of capital made it even harder for the financial sector to operate. Unfavorable rumors regarding Abe and others arriving in Shanghai further dampened sentiment. The eagerness of sellers was particularly evident with the Lianhe bonds, which were sold throughout the day. Others, such as Da Lian, Cheng Da, Tong De, Fu Shun, Yong Yuan, Lian Yi, Tian Feng, Tian Sheng, and Thirty-Eight, also liquidated their holdings along with the market. Hong Da bought in briefly, but quickly sold again. Run He and Ren Chang covered their short positions slightly. No. 20 had some strength to buy E bonds, but still broke the 50 yuan mark. A and C bonds also both broke the 9 yuan mark, falling another 4 to 5.5 jiao. There was no trading in D bonds in the afternoon, so there was no price movement. The total turnover was estimated at around 800,000 to 900,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category High Low Closing Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 59.40 58.95 58.90 Down 0.55</p>

<h3 id="e65">Grains: 40,000 Bags of Changshu and Wuxi Japonica Rice Arrive in Shanghai, Glut of Glutinous Rice Due to Poor Sales Channels <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Regarding domestic rice supplies, the Da Chang Company has procured 40,000 bags of japonica rice from Changzhou, Wuxi, and other areas in the interior, which have been arriving in Shanghai in succession, stored in warehouses one and two, and shipped in batches. It is reported that further procurement has not yet continued, but someone is still procuring in Wuxi. As for the thin rice from Qingpu, Sijing, and other areas, as well as the early and late rice from Nangang, 600 to 700 bags arrive daily, mostly transported by small riverboats, first reaching Hongkou, and then transferred to various storage facilities and banks such as Mao Tai. Glutinous rice, which is not subject to restrictions, continues to circulate as usual, so its arrivals are particularly large. However, the main destination in the past, the Shaoshi area of Zhejiang Province, where it was used in distilleries, is now hindered by transportation difficulties, making it difficult to transport and sell, causing glutinous rice to accumulate in Shanghai, creating an unusual glutinous rice glut. As a result, the price of glutinous rice has fallen repeatedly, becoming comparable to broken rice, and cheaper than high quality japonica rice. This is unprecedented. Yesterday, the price of glutinous rice in the market and gray market fell by about 0.50 yuan. Changshu and Wuxi japonica rice was around 46 yuan, Kunshan and Suzhou japonica rice was 45-46 yuan, Qingpu and Sijing extra thin rice was 45.50 yuan, medium quality was 44-45 yuan, and Nangang early and late rice was 42-43 yuan.</p>
<p>The early market for foreign rice continued the momentum from the previous day, wavering several times without changes. However, due to the persistence of traders, the cargo price was still sustainable, despite the sluggish sales market. Later, as the sales channel became more sluggish, most floating retailers realized that the overall situation was not good and sold off, leading to an oversupply and a gradual decline in prices. As a result, the closing price was about 0.50 yuan lower than the previous market, with No. 1 Saigon at 47 yuan.</p>
<p>The inventory of high-quality foreign rice was relatively small, so the selling price was still stable. The inventory of mid- to low-quality rice was abundant, and once floating retailers sought to sell, the market quietly softened. However, the forward trading continued to be brisk, as original merchants had a bullish view and were unwilling to sell, and about 4,500 to 4,600 tons of tradable chips in the market had been absorbed by the northern merchants and large households. Therefore, although the spot market showed a weakening trend, the asking price for No. 2 Saigon for April and May delivery was 54.50 yuan, and it once dropped lower in the afternoon, but the result was still at the original price. No. 1 road cargo was 55 yuan, and a total of more than 200 tons were offered, with about 7,000 bags of spot goods.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Old Car Brand Flour Returns, Noticed by Speculators <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The flour market trend is firm and quiet. The street's buying is not strong due to increased factory inventories. Only 5,000 to 6,000 bags are directly distributed by the factory. Sales are also slow due to the weekend, and new transactions are very quiet. However, customers still need a price of 15 yuan, so returning goods under old car brands are noticed by general speculators. Those who hold goods tend to hoard them, which is equal to the factory price, and supply is still lacking, leading to sustained support throughout the day. 1,000 bags of Yantai flour will be shipped on the 20th.</p>
<p>Trading in the wheat market has already started. Changshu and Wuxi wheat is priced at 21 yuan. Fuxin Factory purchased three cartloads, and Fufeng Factory is not purchasing for the time being. However, wholesale deliveries to the factory continue at 100 to 200 bags each, which have not yet been priced. The future of the wheat market is gradually stabilizing, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans Rise Sharply <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was strong. Firstly, the soybean cake market was extremely bullish, and oil mills were eager to buy. Secondly, although the export market had weakened, speculators were still absorbing supplies, so the market sentiment remained good, and prices rose repeatedly by 4-5 jiao. However, the overall trading was not as lively as yesterday. It is estimated that more than ten carloads of Bengbu soybeans were traded, priced at 24 yuan; more than 700 bags of Wuhu soybeans were traded, priced from 12.20 yuan to 23.70 yuan; 300 bags of Dingjia Zhou soybeans were traded, priced from 24.50 yuan to 25 yuan; 300 bags of Anqing soybeans were traded, priced from 23.16 yuan; 200 bags of Yangzhou soybeans were traded, priced at 19 yuan; 140 bags of Sangyuan soybeans were traded, priced at 20.70 yuan; and 50 bags of Taicang soybeans were traded, priced at 23.70 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Yarn and Cotton: New Purchases Lacking, Yarn Market Softens <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is flat and weak, showing a slight downward trend. This is because actual sales are not as strong as in the past few days, which has softened sentiment. Many short-term speculators are liquidating their positions, causing the market to decline. Since cotton yarn exports are still large, there are still many people buying when the market falls. The situation is still fluctuating.</p>
<p>Spot yarn trading has slowed down. It is reported that Hong Kong merchants' actual demand is not smooth, and new purchases are not pouring in. The table is lax. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse yarn is 1,390 yuan, down 10 yuan, while the factory price is 1,370 yuan, down 14 yuan. It was then reported that foreign exchange rates were flat, and many retail investors sold off, causing prices to fall another 10 yuan or more. The lowest spot price was 1,370 yuan, and the factory price was 1,355 yuan. The market rallied again near the close. It is found that the half-day turnover was 2,000 bales. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 19 yuan. The amount purchased by each faction is listed below:</p>

<p>Local cotton trading is very light because factory demand is lacking, and the overseas Indian and American cotton markets are not very lively. Therefore, the cotton market situation is flat. However, fellow traders are actively buying and selling Indian cotton. Recently, incoming supplies have been arriving continuously. The Taikoo Company's Whangpoo steamer transported 1,130 bales of Yao cotton from Ningbo yesterday, berthing at the company's dock in the French Concession for unloading, so the cotton market is stable.</p>

<p>Foreign cotton market prices: the New York cotton market was quieter yesterday. Due to mass selling, the market weakened and the closing price was 200 points lower for near term and 7-8 points lower for distant future compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market also fell with future forecasts due to a portion of the bulls losing interest and liquidating, down 5 rupees, and Egyptian rose 5-6 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: According to reliable investigations, the market's raw cotton inventory is low. There will still be one or two ships arriving this month, but no ships will arrive from next month onwards, causing fellow traders to compete to buy spot goods. Cotton for spinning 20-count yarns is a popular item, and the spot price of Indian cotton is actually more than 20 yuan higher than the price quoted by foreign firms. Currently, only long staple cotton is available, and it can still be purchased for more than 10 yuan cheaper than the price quoted by foreign firms. Fellow traders are competing to purchase this raw cotton. Yesterday, 42 count American Mitterling raw cotton was traded at 297 yuan. The prices were converted into delivery-to-factory prices at an exchange rate of 6 yuan for USD, as listed on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Piece Goods: Piece Goods in Hand Sold Back at Low Prices, Fabric Mills Busy with Production <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The futures market saw substantial turnover. Fabric mills are busy with production.</p>
<p>The piece goods market is gradually stabilizing. Retailers continue to sell factory goods, but the prices are difficult to match factory prices. There are many orders for 5-6 month delivery of gray fabrics, particularly autumn goods like wool serge and flannel. Finishing factories and plain street-dyed fabric shops are placing a lot of orders. Therefore, the factories do not have to worry about interrupted work recently. Most sellers did not change their prices yesterday. Hand-held goods were selling cheaply at 0.50 to 1 yuan per piece, and traders were buying them. The street traded nearly 100,000 pieces of coarse and fine cloth twill gray fabric. The Cantonese traders bought 10,000+ pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and poplin. The Zhejiang and Jiangxi traders bought 100+ pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and bleached cloth. 98 pieces of fabric will be transported to Yantai and 11 pieces to Tianjin on the 20th.</p>
<p>The morning market for Dong cloth was quite weak due to the drop in prices. Afterwards, Tianjin merchants bought in. Fellow traders in the street have always been optimistic, and they also started to raise prices. Although the turnover was not large, the fine cloth market gradually stabilized. The closing price for 12-pound "Dragon" cloth was 42.80 yuan, and the price for next month's order was 46 yuan. The current price for "Four Gentlemen" drill was 1.31 yuan per yard, and the price for next month rose to 1.42 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Flannel is Selling Well <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Recently, as the weather has gradually warmed, spring and summer wool fabrics have been selling briskly in a timely manner. Tailors have seen a sharp increase in clothing business, and sales of yard goods for Chinese clothing at retail shops have also increased. Flannel is selling particularly well, and sales are stable. Prices for most goods have already reached their peak and should reasonably drop a bit. Yesterday, domestic Tianjin-exported Ren Li and Tianma brand gray flannel was wholesaled for 16.75 yuan per yard, and the price for Gong Da Shen textiles was 15 yuan. Western goods from Hua Ji and Lao Gong Mao were 18 yuan, and number one British goods with a slanting flower pattern sold for 26-27 yuan, and number two board number four was 20 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Rubberized Cloth Sales Are Even Stronger <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Wool fabrics are in very tight supply, and sales are rising. Retail trade is very strong. Rubberized cloth sales are even more robust. Western goods are out of stock, and few domestic pure rubber products are available, so the market is extremely firm and rising. The material cost for imported goods made entirely of waxed thread has also risen dramatically due to the sharp increase in raw materials. Yesterday, the wholesale price for Shui Cheng rubberized cloth was 1.55 yuan per yard, Ren Tai was 1.65 yuan, Hong Sheng He genuine rubberized cloth sold for 4.25 yuan, Western goods Three Ports genuine rubberized cloth sold for 10.05 yuan, and yellow and white genuine pure rubberized cloth sold for 19 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Coal: White Coal Rises Another 8 Yuan <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Coal stacked up like mountains in warehouses, wholesale limited to two baskets</p>
<p>Although sales of various types of white coal have been very flat lately, owners have been hoarding it because of the expansion of the European war, and wholesale trade is limited to two baskets (1/8 of a ton). This has made people even more restless, and rumors are spreading, allowing the gray market to take the opportunity to manipulate prices. Yesterday, the Mallory vessel brought 2,500 tons of Hongji white coal, which was transferred at the pier and sold by Da Long Xing. Although there is plenty of coal stacked up in the warehouses, and there is no shortage, the listed price today has risen another 8 yuan, to 188 yuan per ton, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Sugar Market: "Car White" Slackens <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trended weaker due to the release of 15,000 bags of "X" sugar from the previous day. The association's listed prices were 64.70 yuan for new 24 coarse white sugar from foreign warehouses and 64.50 yuan for old goods, unchanged. Taikoo "Car White" sugar showed some slackening, with "B Mark" sugar from Western warehouses at 71.42 yuan, down 0.02 yuan. Other "OW Mark" sugars were similarly reduced. Spot "Zero Red" sugar was 53.75 yuan, up 0.25 yuan. Domestic "Diao Qing" sugar continued to open at 50 bags, 51.50 yuan, up 0.50 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Dried Goods: Miscellaneous Lichee Branches Weak <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been some continued arrivals of miscellaneous lychee branches, but sales are still normal, so the market is gradually declining. The price of "Section Bamboo" branches has dropped by more than 10 yuan, and the current market price is less than 100 yuan. "Black Leaf" branches are even weaker, and high-quality goods are scarce. However, it is heard that the stock in the production areas is running out, so the prices are relatively firm, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Cangzhou Jujubes Recover <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Jujubes have fallen too much and are showing signs of recovery. Yesterday, 119 bags of Cangzhou jujubes were opened, with the wholesale price listed for North Specification at 30 yuan, up 5-6 yuan from before. At the same time, Tianjin goods are also showing a tight trend. Checks of the market show that the inventory is gradually decreasing. The inventory of genuine Tianjin goods is only a few hundred bags. The market price for Tianjin red jujube king is 60 yuan, jujube heads 50 yuan, first households 40 yuan, second households 30 yuan, and unified red jujubes 10 yuan. High quality Fujian jujubes are 22-23 yuan, ordinary ones are 18-20 yuan, and long red jujubes are 15-16 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Yang Ge, Detained in Japan, Has Quietly Arrived in Shanghai, Bringing His Wife and Children to Reside at the Metropole Hotel for a Short Ten-Day Stay Before Returning to the United States <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yang Ge, the Far East General Manager of the American International News Service, formerly stationed in Tokyo, has arrived in Shanghai from Japan on the Yasukuni Maru with his wife and beloved child. He arrived at the port at 10 PM the night before last and is residing at the Metropole Hotel, where he will stay for a short ten days. Yang Ge was arrested in Tokyo on January 21 by the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department for allegedly disseminating "incorrect military information" and was detained for two months. Subsequently, the Tokyo Prosecutor's Office filed charges against him under Article 99 of the Army Criminal Code, and the Tokyo Court sentenced him on the morning of March 23 to six months of imprisonment with labor. However, because Yang Ge is an American citizen and, according to American law, citizens enjoy freedom of speech, and because he works in the press, the court decided to grant him a three-year suspended sentence. Yang Ge was released the next day. After Yang Ge's arrest, news of it caused widespread shock. It is understood that the reason for Yang Ge's arrest was that he published articles in Japanese newspapers about the situation in China, which the Japanese authorities considered to be shaking Japanese public opinion. Yang Ge had also held talks with Japanese and foreign friends at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo, which was also resented by the Japanese authorities, leading to his arrest. However, because Yang Ge is an American citizen, they dared not make things too difficult for him, so they concluded the matter with a suspended sentence.</p>
<p>Will Return to the United States in a Short Period</p>
<p>After a short ten-day stay in Shanghai, Yang Ge will still go to Japan before taking the ashes of American journalist Harry Keys, who recently passed away in Beijing, back to the United States. Harry Keys died of a heart attack in front of Hibiya Park in Tokyo on April 10. His funeral was held two days later. The American Ambassador to Japan, Grew, and the Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Su, representing Hirota, both attended the ceremony to pay their respects.</p>
<p>Japanese Domestic Turmoil and Unease</p>
<p>The English-American Great Evening Post published an article yesterday describing in detail the organization of terrorist groups in Japan and how they manipulate politics. The article begins by stating that Japan is now internationally isolated and is universally condemned as a threat to world peace and an aggressor. The reason for this is the active presence of terrorist groups in the country, who use</p>
<p>Coercive Means</p>
<p>to suppress all tendencies towards liberalism or to simultaneously plan conspiracies to expand the power of the Japanese Empire on the Asian continent. Japanese terrorist groups are roughly divided into two types: ronin and "warriors." Few of these Japanese terrorists are punished by the authorities. They are sometimes hired to</p>
<p>Hold Demonstrations</p>
<p>in front of foreign embassies, while the "warriors" are secret patriotic organizations that solicit donations from various shops. Those who refuse to donate are labeled as "unpatriotic." The ronin in China are all employed by Japanese reactionary societies. The most powerful of these societies is the Black Dragon Society, headed by Mitsuru Toyama. The society's activities are focused on opposing the Soviet Union, while other ronin suppress strikes and anti-dangerous elements. In Tokyo not long ago, a</p>
<p>Labor Party</p>
<p>leader named Oyama was severely beaten by them, and the police who witnessed the incident stood by and did nothing. The former Minister of Home Affairs, Suetsugu, was a member of the Kokuhonsha, and the former Prime Minister Hiranuma was the founder of the Kokuhonsha. General Masaki was also a member of the society. Since the "February 26" Incident, Hiranuma and his subordinates have gradually gained power. Therefore,</p>
<p>Japanese Politics</p>
<p>is entirely manipulated by these terrorists filled with fascist ideas, who act arbitrarily and attempt to conquer China by force. Once the war progresses to an unmanageable point, this reactionary ruling class will immediately collapse without a doubt.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Farewell to the Five German Nationals; Statement from the French Consulate: These Five People Engaged in "Anti-French Activities," Hence a Friendly Advisory to Leave for Other Suitable Places <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The French Consulate General in Shanghai announced on the 19th that five German nationals residing within the French Concession had been given a "friendly advisory" to leave the country by the end of this month. When the European War broke out, the French authorities notified the German nationals in the Concession that if they did not disturb the peace and if their actions did not violate the neutrality of the French Concession, they could continue to reside there without interference. However, these five German residents did not abide by this promise and have been ordered to move out by the end of the month. The French Consulate General has confirmed that they engaged in "anti-French activities." According to German sources, four other well-known German nationals have also been notified by the French Concession Police Department to leave. These four are believed to be representatives of the German official commercial news agency, Karl Molk, the scientific publicity section of the chemical company Haas, the representative of a German manufacturer, Xu Xin, and the German businessman, Hafmey. However, the French authorities have also admitted that another German national has also been ordered to leave, but they do not want to reveal his name.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Three Clashes in Guerrilla Warfare West of Shanghai; Japanese Troops Suffer Heavy Losses; Several Thousand Japanese Troops Have Not Yet Withdrawn; Over Eight Hundred Elderly, Weak, Women, and Children Tragically Tortured <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The mobile warfare west of Shanghai has been very active in recent days. The Japanese side is currently mobilizing heavy troops, about two or three thousand, along with about one thousand puppet troops, and deploying defenses along the Suzhou Creek and the Qinghu Highway. Since these Japanese troops were attacked by Chinese mobile units, they have been slaughtering innocent villagers for days. The tragedy that the Japanese army carried out when the Chinese army withdrew during the "August 13th" Shanghai battle is now being replayed in the area west of Hongqiao Airport, less than twenty kilometers from the Shanghai concessions. The following is a summary of the various situations recounted by villagers who came to Shanghai from the area yesterday afternoon:</p>
<p>Three Encounters</p>
<p>It is reported that the Chinese guerrillas near the Qinghu Highway have had three encounters with the Japanese army recently. The first was on the 12th of this month at Xiaolian Bridge, northwest of Hongqiao Airport along the Puhuitang, where fierce fighting lasted for five hours. The second was on the 15th of this month near the Xujing Zhaoxiang area at the junction of Qingpu and Shanghai, where fierce fighting lasted for seven hours. The third was near Dujiagang, west of Qibao Town in western Shanghai, where fierce fighting also lasted for three hours. Of these three battles, the battle of Zhaoxiang on the 15th of this month was the most damaging to the Japanese army, a rare occurrence in any mobile warfare in the suburbs of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Gu's Troops Break Through</p>
<p>After the Japanese army was first attacked by Chinese troops on the 12th of this month, they mobilized about three or four thousand Japanese and puppet troops, more than twenty tanks, and aircraft from the area west of Hongqiao Airport, east of Qingpu, north of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and south of the Suzhou Creek to carry out a so-called "mopping-up" operation, hoping to wipe out the Chinese troops in one fell swoop. All the strongholds west of Shanghai, such as Hongqiao, Qibao, Panlong, Zhudi, Xinzhuang, Sijing, Qianjing, Huangbo, Nanxiang, Guanyintang, and other towns, have increased their heavy troops, forming an encirclement. As of yesterday afternoon, they had not yet withdrawn. However, it is said that Gu Fusheng's unit of the Third Detachment of the Chinese army broke through the heavy encirclement the day before and moved to a safe area for rest.</p>
<p>Village Calamities</p>
<p>However, after suffering losses, the Japanese army harbored resentment against the villagers for harboring Chinese troops, so they first set fire to peasant villages in Zhudi, Guanyintang, Dujiagang, and other places on a large scale. At least more than a thousand houses were destroyed, and villagers who encountered the Japanese army, regardless of age, were shot or stabbed to death with bayonets. In Guanyintang alone, about five hundred women, children, and elderly people were tragically tortured. Around Zhudi, about two hundred people were affected, and around Dujiagang, west of Qibao, about one hundred people were affected. As a result, those villagers in the area who had some wealth fled to Shanghai, and those who were poor and destitute fled to other places. Nearby towns have become nearly deserted. It is also reported that Gu's troops safely retreated from the Qinghu Road battle the night before last. The Japanese and puppet troops immediately advanced in two routes, one from Xujing north to Chongu Guanyintang, and the other from Xujing south to Dujiagang Xiaolian Bridge, searching house to house and shooting farmers indiscriminately. Many elderly, women, and children were humiliated.</p>
<p>Japanese Defense</p>
<p>Hongqiao Airport in western Shanghai had many buildings, all of which were destroyed during the Shanghai battle. The area is a key road west of Shanghai, and the Japanese side plans to station heavy troops there to prevent guerrilla attacks. Therefore, they have been building more than fifty barracks on the east side of the airport (i.e., at the intersection of Poasi Road) since the day before yesterday, all built with old bricks.</p>
<p>Attacks on Cars</p>
<p>According to transportation sources, a long-distance bus heading to Pinghu from Jiaxing the day before yesterday, full of passengers, was suddenly attacked near Jiuliting, resulting in the death of four passengers and the injury of more than ten others.</p>

<p>Danish and Norwegian merchant ships have recently been affected by the expansion of the European War. All Danish ships sailing in the Far East have been suspended, and Norwegian ships have also been ordered to concentrate in Hong Kong. Those in this city and Southeast Asia are continuing to sail to Hong Kong to await orders. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the Danish ship Meizhongmei, which is berthed in Shanghai, also left Shanghai for Hong Kong on the morning of the day before yesterday (the 19th). The Meixi, which transported goods from Shanghai to Yantai at the beginning of this month, is still berthed in Yantai. Whether it will leave Yantai or go elsewhere is unknown. The Norwegian ship Wellford (managed by Jebsen &amp; Co.), which was originally scheduled to load a large batch of corn, more than 6,000 bags, on the 12th of this month and transport it to Longkou, has unloaded the goods that had been loaded at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong. After completing the unloading on the 19th, it set sail for Hong Kong at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning (the 20th).</p>
<p>Norwegian Ship Rerouted</p>
<p>It is reported that the Norwegian ship Talismar, managed by the shipping department of the Tianxiang Company, was carrying goods from the United States via Little Luzon to Shanghai and was originally scheduled to arrive on the day before yesterday (the 19th). Unexpectedly, on the morning of the day before yesterday, it was stopped by a British warship while sailing in the waters of Daji. The ship has now sailed back to Hong Kong. The company also has two Norwegian ships, Titania and Tiranna, which are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai next Thursday (the 25th). According to the company, due to the above-mentioned situation, it is feared that they will not be able to come to Shanghai at that time. As for whether Norwegian ships can continue to sail in the Far East, although the manager of the China Shipping Company has been going to the consulate every day to discuss the matter for the past week, the results are still unknown. However, it is expected that an order will arrive in Shanghai within the next week with a definite solution.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Watching</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the Shanghai Japanese Navy spokesperson recently declared that "the Japanese military believes that the status of the charter ships has not changed because Denmark and Norway are neutral countries and have not declared war." Japanese merchants in the Far East, who have also chartered several Danish and Norwegian ships, are closely watching the development of the shipping situation, as the results of the development will have a significant impact on these ships.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of the war of resistance, countless young men and women have gone deep into the interior, each contributing their talents to serve the country.

<h3 id="e87">Relief for Zhongshan Refugees - Charity Broadcast Conference - Opened at the Xindu Radio Station Yesterday - Three-Day Conference Unprecedented in Scale <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai All Circles Relief for Zhongshan Refugees Charity Broadcast Conference, which had been in preparation for a long time, opened yesterday at the Xindu Hotel Glass Radio Station on Nanjing Road. At 11:30 a.m. yesterday, the chairman of the conference, Guo Shun, Feng Bingnan, Li Ze, and others led the opening ceremony with speeches. Prominent figures in the city, such as Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Ludeng, also enthusiastically participated. The conference will last for three days, from yesterday to the 22nd. Participants in the charity broadcast include famous musicians from Shanghai, high-ranking ladies, famous amateur opera singers, famous actors, famous courtesans, and all kinds of artists such as comedians and ballad singers who are enthusiastically participating. The scale is grand and the situation is unprecedented.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results Exceeded Ten Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The Xindu Hotel believes that the nature of this charity broadcast to aid the Zhongshan compatriots in distress is related to the belief and commemoration of the late Premier, so it voluntarily sacrificed three days of business and generously provided tea for the guests. The admission tickets are divided into two types: one yuan "Joyful Benevolence Ticket" and five yuan "Charity Ticket". Ladies from all walks of life actively participated. From 12:00 noon yesterday to 2:00 a.m. late at night, a total of more than ten thousand yuan was donated, which proves that the ladies of Shanghai, in addition to enjoying entertainment, are also extremely concerned about the compatriots in distress in the Premier's hometown.</p>
<p>Today and Tomorrow's Programs are Wonderful</p>
<p>Today's program includes various wonderful programs such as Chinese and Western music by Southern ladies, famous amateur opera singers, famous actors, comedians, and miscellaneous performances. It is hoped that benevolent ladies will gather their strength to assist.</p>
<p>Guo Shun's Speech</p>
<p>Guo Shun said in his speech, "Ladies and gentlemen, Zhongshan County has fallen once since October 7th last year. The countryside is devastated, and it is now the dead of winter. Residents are displaced and suffering from hunger and cold. The fellow villagers in Shanghai, following Hong Kong Zhongshan, established the Shanghai Relief Zhongshan Disaster Work on the fourth floor of Wing On Department Store on Nanjing Road on November 18th. The work is in progress. At the beginning of March of this year, it fell again. This disaster is more serious than last year. All the people in the county are displaced and wandering on the road. The tragic situation is unprecedented. Zhongshan County is the hometown of the late Premier and is concerned by China and foreign countries. Moreover, since the fall of Guangzhou, the area has become a transportation hub between Hong Kong and Macau, and a thoroughfare for people from the mainland. There are many people from other provinces who have taken refuge in the county. When the war comes, transportation is cut off first. The residents in the territory are waiting to die. The winter storage is empty, and spring farming is also affected. Therefore, the victims are from all provinces, not just the people of Zhongshan County. In order to step up fundraising, on the one hand, we have invited the Wing On Music Society to give a free Cantonese opera performance for six nights at the Lyceum Theatre from the 22nd of this month. On the other hand, from now on, for three consecutive days, we will invite famous musicians from this city to broadcast songs through this radio station. The songs requested and the income from the Xindu tea will be used to help the victims. I hope that all philanthropists will uphold the principle of not dividing regions in disaster relief, and generously donate to help the Zhongshan refugees get rid of their suffering. I am deeply grateful. Furthermore, this grand broadcast has been assisted by Mr. Yu Qiaqing and others. The vice chairman of this association, Mr. Li Ze, and the members Chen Qihao have been providing money and effort. All the musicians and famous amateur opera singers have been broadcasting voluntarily. All the benefactors have been donating enthusiastically. On behalf of the Zhongshan refugees, I would like to express my sincere gratitude."</p>
<p>Feng Bingnan's Speech</p>
<p>Mr. Feng Bingnan gave a speech at the opening ceremony of the charity broadcast of the Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association. Thank you to the association for not abandoning me. I should have come to the radio station in person to broadcast my opening speech, but I am not in good health, so I have been closing my doors to recuperate at home for more than two years. I have not been able to leave the house so far. According to the doctor's instructions, I am absolutely not allowed to go out, so it is not appropriate for me to give the opening speech. However, the gentlemen of the Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association have taken my situation into consideration and said that the Xindu Radio Station has installed a new rebroadcasting machine, and I can rebroadcast by phone at home. This shows that they have placed too much trust in me, so although I know that it is not appropriate for me to take on this task, I cannot strongly refuse. Today, I can only sit at home and speak, and I cannot come to the radio station in person. I am very sorry for this. I have always regarded serving the society as the highest vocation in life. As long as it is right and within my ability, I am happy to respond. Because I think that all things in the world are one, and all human beings are the same kind. If people of the same kind need my help, how can I not be happy to do my best? Since all mankind is like one whole body, if one part of the body is injured, the other parts must take care of it. If a place is unfortunately afflicted by disaster, places without disaster or with less disaster should help it. If some people are suffering, those without suffering or with less suffering should think of ways to help them. If one part of the body is injured and the other parts are unaware and do not care, then that person is numb. Zhongshan County has unfortunately been repeatedly afflicted by disaster, and the severity of the disaster can be imagined. Listeners, I think many of you have personally experienced a life of hardship. Now we are considered to be living in a relatively safe area, but don't forget the misery of our fellow human beings in the insecure areas. They are worried about planes and bombs day and night. The injured may not receive medical care. Many who are lucky enough not to be injured often endure unbearable hunger and thirst under the scorching sun. Not only is it difficult to eat a mouthful of rice, but they can't even drink a mouthful of water. They are exposed to the elements, wind and rain, and many of them are sick. The tragic scene cannot be described in words. They are waiting for death at all times, and they are also expecting fellow human beings to come and rescue them at all times. Now, the fellow villagers in Zhongshan County feel the extreme pain suffered by their hometown and have launched this association to seek relief. This is indeed a spirit of self-help. Those who can help themselves are qualified to ask for help from others. Therefore, the Zhongshan fellow villagers should enthusiastically support this initiative. Even those who are not from Zhongshan, or even people from any other place, have the obligation to help. Whether it is a person, a place, or a country, first of all, it must have a spirit of self-help, and give full play to its own abilities. When it is necessary, it can ask for help from others. When someone asks for your help, if the request is reasonable and you have the ability to do so, you should not hesitate to help them, because mutual assistance is the highest morality of mankind and the most important condition for human survival. Not only is it necessary to help each other in times of crisis, but also in ordinary times. No one can do without the help of others, and no one should not help others. The reason why human beings are different from animals, and the reason why human beings have been able to survive in the world for tens of millions of years, is because they have developed this virtue of mutual assistance, and they have been helping each other unconsciously. Only with mutual assistance can there be a society, and only with mutual assistance can there be a world. The current disaster is not only in Zhongshan, nor is it only in China. Three-quarters of the world are in a very chaotic situation. It is a time of upheaval. Even those who live in relatively peaceful Shanghai are inevitably affected by this disaster. Every day when we open the newspaper, almost four-fifths of it is reporting news of human beings suffering. Since human beings are in such a difficult situation, they should give full play to the spirit of mutual assistance in order to survive. We are all in the same boat. In calm seas, we still need to cooperate with each other. If the waves are dangerous, we need everyone to help each other to get through safely. Today I can help others, and others will help me in the future. A person needs help from others in many places, not necessarily referring to disasters. This time, the Shanghai Relief Zhongshan Refugee Association is holding a charity broadcast to raise funds for relief. Many actors and amateur artists are volunteering to sing. This is the powerful contributing their strength, and the listeners are donating to request songs. This is the rich contributing their money, which is very much in line with the purpose of mutual assistance. Not only should the Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association thank the enthusiastic people on both sides who contribute money and effort, but also those who are concerned about the welfare of mankind. I am also one of mankind, so I should also express my gratitude to the people who contribute money and effort, and to all the artists. The holding of this association has not only been supported by fellow villagers, but has also been sympathized by people from other provinces. I just heard that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Jin Tingsun, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, and Mr. Lin Kanghou have sympathy for this association. They have invited artists from other provinces to help with a day's program. The originally planned two-day broadcast has now been extended to three days, which shows that everyone has the same heart of mutual assistance. The enthusiasm of Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Jin Tingsun, and the artists from other provinces is worthy of our deep gratitude. Some people may criticize the holding of broadcasting and performances, thinking that in this time of war and turmoil, how can we bear to hold entertainment? Didn't Ouyang Xiu say, "Worry and labor can rejuvenate a country, while pleasure and ease can destroy oneself"? I think there can be two views on entertainment. Everything has a limit. Everything that is within the limit is right. Anything that exceeds the limit is not good. Entertainment is also like this. Excessive entertainment can make people indulge in pleasure and lose their ambition, waste time and delay matters, and waste energy and money. Entertainment that is within the limit can regulate the spirit and increase work efficiency. Therefore, after a person is extremely tired and extremely nervous, being able to use entertainment as a relief can easily restore the spirit and prevent health from being damaged. Among the six arts in ancient China, music, archery, and horsemanship accounted for half of them. Music, archery, and riding are all things that belong to entertainment. Just like a person who is tired from work cannot but sleep, we cannot say that in times of crisis, we are not allowed to sleep. In times of crisis and survival, regulating the spirit and maintaining health is also an important thing. The more troubled and depressed you are, the more you need entertainment. Entertainment itself is not bad, it just depends on whether the nature of the entertainment is noble. Wise men in ancient times also used wine to relieve their sorrows, but excessive drinking may not be beneficial to health. However, we can already see that in times of tension and depression, everyone needs adjustment. I am saying these words not to defend the entertainment operators, but based on the facts. Moreover, I have no taste for other general entertainment except reading, and I have not participated in the entertainment business, so I am the most qualified to say this fair word. Finally, I hope that all listeners, regardless of provincial boundaries, county boundaries, and even national boundaries, all who have the sympathy of human mutual assistance, will enthusiastically support the relief work of the Zhongshan Refugee Relief Association this time. I have said a lot of words and wasted a lot of your time. Now, in the capacity of a member of mankind, I would like to express my gratitude to all the listeners and to the staff who have contributed their efforts."</p>

<h3 id="e89">After Commander Xie's Mother Died - Expresses His Feelings and Strives Hard - Grieved and Enduring, Diligently Learning and Practicing - Hoping Not to Betray the Expectations of Compatriots <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Li Tai, the mother of Commander Xie Jinyuan of the Lone Army Camp, passed away due to illness on the 12th in her hometown of Jiaoling, Guangdong. Commander Xie was deeply saddened because he was stranded on a isolated island and unable to attend the funeral. All circles in Shanghai expressed their condolences to Xie for the tragic death of his mother, hoping that he would restrain his grief and cherish himself for the sake of the country. Xie specifically issued a statement yesterday to thank all circles for their condolence. The original text says, "At 6:00 p.m. on April 13th, I received a telegram from home and was shocked to learn that my old mother had passed away in the morning. The bad news came and I was heartbroken. Jinyuan is ungrateful, and was not able to serve her medicine when she was alive, and could not see her burial after her death. Encountering family difficulties, and causing further sorrow to my elderly father, I am confused and ashamed. The sin of unfilial piety will be regretted forever. Since my elder brother passed away in the 18th year of the Republic of China, leaving only one daughter, and Jinyuan has dedicated himself to the party and the country, and is busy with military affairs, I am alone. My mother had already mourned the sudden death of her son, and relied on her son to return. My mother's hair turned white, and the family was in decline. Sadness and grief caused her health to decline day by day, and she often fell ill. How could heaven not bless my mother's remaining years? Alas, it is painful! Jinyuan has been trembling and restless for ten days, sitting and lying uneasily. According to my fortune, this year is extremely difficult and dangerous. I am worried in my heart. On the 9th, I read my father's letter dated March 2nd, knowing that my mother was weak and thinking of her son eagerly, sobbing at midnight. After reading it, I shed tears. I sent a telegram, roughly saying, "I am in pain of losing my freedom, in case of death, this regret will be endless." According to the time, it should have arrived on the evening of the 10th or noon on the 11th, but my mother passed away on the morning of the 13th. As the saying goes, "A loving mother's love for her son is in her heart." My mother worked hard all her life, saved money, and raised Jinyuan to adulthood. Before her death, she only protected these few words of telegram, which increased Jinyuan's fear and panic. Since Jinyuan left home at the age of 18 to study in Guangzhou, and after four years, transferred to the Whampoa Military Academy, and graduated in the 15th year of the Republic of China, and followed the army on the Northern Expedition, only in the autumn of the 17th year of the Republic of China did I return home to visit my family for two weeks due to injury, and in the spring of the 25th year of the Republic of China, I sent my family back to my hometown twice. Unexpectedly, this farewell would be a final farewell. My family has a small amount of property, works diligently, and is frugal, and does not worry about freezing or starving. However, my family is in a "weak house" position, and is often bullied and insulted for no reason. My father and mother have endured hardships and swallowed their anger for decades. However, my brother and I are naturally foolish and wise. As children, we could not bear the oppression of the environment on my family, and we stood up and argued with reason. However, because our strength was not as good as others, we were often subjected to abuse and beatings by the strong. Thinking about it now, it is still vivid in my mind. My mother is kind, gentle, thrifty, hardworking, and cares for her children. She personally takes care of everything, food and clothing, and teaches them. She never slacks, but my family is in a difficult situation, so the constraints on the children are particularly strict. A meal and a porridge cannot be taken lightly. However, Jinyuan is particularly naughty by nature, which often makes my mother unable to laugh or cry. I especially remember when I was a child, whenever I saw my mother kill a chicken or duck, she would always mutter something. Jinyuan once asked, "What is my mother saying?" She said that you are young and ignorant, and you smile when you see animals being killed, but all things in the world have their own spirituality, and killing is a sin. My mother does not believe in religion, but the kindness and compassion of her are too numerous to write down. Thinking about the past and the present, I have mixed feelings. Jinyuan will from now on atone for his sins in the ranks, and will work harder and be more vigilant, and be loyal to repay the country. Therefore, in the past thirty months, the dangerous environment and the humiliation of the strong have increased with time. The decline of public reason and justice, and international law has become a tool used by a part of the people. The difficult years are not known to end. Only whether people are involved in the revolution, looking up to the country and the nation, and are determined to "endure pain and learn diligently" to pray that they will not betray the nurturing of heaven and earth, the cultivation of the party and the country, and the teachings of good teachers and the expectations of compatriots. Furthermore, we must closely follow the instructions of the leader to "be independent, self-reliant, and self-strengthening", work hard to encourage ourselves, and adhere to the principles of "not being discouraged, not yielding, and not being humiliated", so as to not disgrace this life, to redeem the deep grace of my virtuous mother in the days to come, and to comfort the hope of the nine springs."</p>
<h3 id="e90">British Federation Shipyards All Struck - Shengjing Delayed from Docking <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The four shipyards of the British Federation, the Yaisong and Ruiyong shipyards, have been on strike for a long time. Now it is known that the Xiang Sheng and Hefeng factories in Pudong have also been affected. The Taikoo Company's Beiyang liner Shengjing, which was undergoing annual repairs at the Hefeng factory shipyard, should have been completed last Friday according to regulations. Due to the impact of the strike, the unloaded propellers and anchors could not be installed and the ship could not leave the dock. In addition to negotiating with the factory, Taikoo Company hired Russian craftsmen to go to the factory to install the parts. It was scheduled to leave the dock yesterday and resume sailing today, but it could not be completed on time, so it failed to leave the dock yesterday. It is said that it will be able to leave the dock today and sail to the company's wharf in the French Concession, and resume sailing next Tuesday (23rd). However, the cargo of the Hakka people reported to be loaded on the ship has been piled up at the wharf.</p>

<p>The French Concession Police recently cracked the case of highway robbers Lu Jinrong, Zhang Jinsheng, Xu Abing, Zhang Xiaodi, Xia Shunsheng, Lu Jiasheng, Wu Jinsu, and eight others, and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation, and pursued the stolen goods for further investigation. During the investigation, it was found that Feng Xiaoyun (40 years old, local), the owner of the Dazhong Hotel on Zhengjia Bridge, Avenue Edward VII, had bought stolen goods, so Feng was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for detention.</p>
<p>Combined Trial</p>
<p>The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now, the Shanxi Road Police found that the Daike Goudang Department of Laotianshi Silver Shop on Avenue de France also received stolen goods, and arrested the store manager Wang Changchun. Yesterday morning, the police sent Lu and other robbers and Feng and Wang, who received the stolen goods, to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court, where Judge Miao Qingbang interrogated them. The police lawyer requested a postponement due to the unresolved investigation, and said that Lu Jinrong had confessed that he had robbed a Russian woman of</p>
<p>a pair of diamond earrings</p>
<p>worth 2,000 yuan at the entrance of No. 2831 Avenue de France at the end of September last year, and sold them to Laotianshi Silver Shop for 190 yuan. Xu Abing confessed that he had robbed a woman Chen Chen's handbag at the entrance of No. 168 Route Wagner on the 6th of this month, which contained a gold cigarette holder, a gold cigarette case, and a diamond-studded watch, worth a total of 2,300 yuan, and sold them to Feng Xiaoyun for 460 yuan, and so on. During the interrogation, the robbers confessed to committing robbery or participating in robbery, and Wang Changchun also</p>
<p>admitted to receiving stolen goods.</p>
<p>Feng Xiaoyun confessed that Yao Rongfu rented a corner of the Dazhong Hotel to set up a business for redeeming pawned goods, and Xu sold the stolen goods to Yao. They negotiated the price in an empty small room, which I saw and scolded Yao for not talking in the empty room and told them to go out. The stolen goods were bought by Yao, and I did not participate. He also hired lawyer Ai Zhenlin to defend him. After the court verified the confession, it ordered a postponement for further interrogation on the 25th, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Chen Xiaoming, a pediatrician from Danyang, at No. 54, Lane 177, Qipu Road, was suddenly invaded by five armed robbers at 11:15 a.m. on the 19th. They took out pistols, threatened them not to make a sound, robbed property worth 140 yuan, and swaggered away. The tea servant Wang Xihe followed them to the opposite side of the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road, and four robbers hired a car from Taitelai Motor Company, intending to rob somewhere else. The report was made to the patrol officers No. 565, Hua Sandao Tou, and No. 1443, No. 1667, No. 2202, and No. 355 and other four Chinese police officers, who surrounded the car. The robbers resisted arrest and opened fire. Both sides fought. As a result, one robber was shot dead and two were captured. Two pistols and seven bullets were seized. A stray bullet injured a 12-year-old boy, who died from his injuries after a while, and Lu Lianyuan, a native of Tongzhou, were treated in the hospital. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Now it has been found that the dead robber's name is Qi Asheng, 20 years old (origin unknown). The two robbers who were arrested are Jin Honggen (27 years old) and Chen Zhenglin (33 years old), both from Jiangbei. Jin was also shot several times in the body and is being treated in the patrol hospital. The two bodies of the dead robber Qi Asheng and the 12-year-old boy were taken to the Jiaozhou Road Morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, the police sent the arrested robber Chen Zhenglin to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu claimed that the leader of the robbers, Wang Afu, was on the run, and requested a postponement. Then, the doctor Chen Xiaoming and the tea servant Wang Xihe testified to the incident. When Chen was questioned, he confessed that he was invited by the fugitive Wang Afu to commit the robbery, and that the pistols and other items were all from him. The rest of the confession was vague. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be returned to custody and re-examined at a later date.</p>

<p>At about 9:00 p.m. on the night before (the 19th), two neatly dressed Russians, carrying a pair of handcuffs, suddenly arrived at the Zhongxi Sanatorium at No. 536 Rue Paul Beau. They were spotted by Ding, a Chinese guard from Anhui, No. 289 of the hospital, who thought they were Western police officers from the police station. He immediately stepped forward. Unexpectedly, the two Russians asked him where his pistol was. He replied that he was not wearing it and it was hidden in his room. Upon hearing this, the visitors took out handcuffs and handcuffed him, forcing him to ask where it was hidden. At this time, the hospital had received the news and knew that they were robbers, so they immediately called the police station. By the time the police officers arrived, the two Russian criminals had already escaped without a trace.</p>

<p>Recently, a large number of young rogues have been robbing pedestrians of their property in the area of Avenue Edward VII and North Jiangxi Road. At about 10:00 a.m. the day before, Wang Bingrong, a native of Ningbo, was carrying a bag of tin foil ash worth 120 yuan when he passed by the area. The rogues saw him and thought that there was money or legal tender hidden in the bag, so they rushed forward and surrounded him, robbing him of the tin foil ash and fleeing in different directions. As a result, Shi Huanting, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, arrested Yi Daqun, a native of Tongzhou, and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special Court, where the police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested detention. The court ruled that the case would be re-examined at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Summary of General Manager Fan Keling's Speech at the Annual Meeting (3) <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned above, the ordinary reserve fund had been almost entirely depleted. Therefore, it was decided last year to increase the surtax rate to 18% starting from October 1st. At the same time, it was hoped that the exchange rate would not continue to decline and that income would remain normal, so that a balanced budget could be produced for 1940. The severe drop in the national currency around July of last year deeply affected the budget. In order to remedy this, a special sub-committee was formed to study the Bureau's economic situation. The committee formulated several recommendations, which were all adopted by the Bureau. Simultaneously, the Bureau managed to borrow a new loan of 10 million yuan to meet urgent needs.</p>
<p>The budget for each department for this fiscal year has already been published separately. The draft budget was carefully scrutinized, resulting in a total reduction of more than 2 million yuan. Unfortunately, the current skyrocketing food prices have led to an increase of approximately 1.5 million yuan, offsetting the budget reductions.</p>
<p>Regarding this year's recurrent income, including the proposed additional surcharge and excluding educational expenses and the previous year's deficit, it is estimated that the net income will be around 37,806,700. The budget for each item of income has been prepared based on various facts. If there are no significant changes during the year, it should be possible to achieve the goals. Due to the income from various public utilities and municipal services, an increase of 2,632,000 yuan is expected this year. The allocation for educational expenses is 2,711,440 yuan, corresponding to a surtax rate of 2%.</p>
<p>The total estimated recurrent expenditure is approximately 42,870,390 yuan, excluding educational expenses and the previous year's deficit. Last year's recurrent expenses totaled 28,232,460 yuan. The biggest reason for the increase is the depreciation of the national currency, which has led to a sharp increase in various expenses required for the Bureau to maintain good administrative efficiency. While the Bureau has made every effort to economize, it has also taken into account the need to maintain and develop key tasks, and cannot be negligent even in these uncertain times. Department heads have been able to understand the Bureau's intention to save, and each plan that requires large expenditures has been carefully considered before being approved. Most foreign staff members have temporarily suspended their furloughs this year, saving considerable expenses.</p>
<p>The Police Department's needs for this year are approximately 4,367,360 yuan more than last year. If we can understand the importance of maintaining law and order under the current circumstances, we will not consider the increased police expenses to be unreasonable.</p>
<p>Ordinary expenses are approximately 5,304,920 yuan more than last year. The biggest reason is that the amount of staff pensions and other retirement benefits that must be paid according to regulations has increased due to the tightening of the exchange rate. These expenses are bound by contracts, and it is impossible to reduce them for the time being unless the exchange situation improves. The guaranteed exchange rate for staff savings has been revised, reduced to eight pence from May 1st of this year. Furthermore, future employee compensation will be calculated in national currency as much as possible. Once these two measures are implemented, it is hoped that ordinary expenses can be gradually reduced.</p>
<p>As for the estimated deficit in the recurrent expenditure budget for this year, it is 5,572,280 yuan, of which 509,590 yuan is the shortfall in educational expenses. Educational expenses are not allowed to exceed the income from a surtax rate of 2%, but this year's educational expense budget must exceed this due to a sharp increase in various expenses. In the future, efforts should be made to reduce expenses and increase tuition fees in order to reduce the aforementioned budget deficit. Although the educational expense budget was approved, the additional allocation was not passed after discussion.</p>
<p>The estimated budget for various temporary expenses is around 1,859,6306 yuan, which does not include temporary educational expenses. The deficit carried over from the previous year is 2,970,530 yuan. This year's funds are intended to cover various major facilities, debt repayment, pension fund contributions, emergency measures, and to make up for the deficit in the recurrent expenditure budget, totaling 13,889,100 yuan. Among them, the expenses for land requisition, construction, and various other expenses have been reduced to a minimum. The temporary expenditure for education is a construction cost of 89,600 yuan.</p>
<p>Various temporary income, due to the sale of the Bureau's surplus land, can yield 950,000 yuan. Other miscellaneous income is estimated at 30,000 yuan. In order to cope with various expenditures in this year's temporary expense budget, it is planned to issue new public bonds or use other methods to raise 16 million yuan, the use of which is stated in the temporary expense budget.</p>
<p>All of this year's Bureau's various expense budgets, as well as the proposed surtax increase measures, together with the funds to be raised in the temporary expense budget, totaling no more than 16 million yuan or its equivalent, are hereby requested to be approved by the General Assembly for implementation.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Anti-Narcotics Division of the Central Police Department received a tip-off and rushed to Room 122 of the Jiangsu Inn at No. 50, Lane 379, Guangdong Road. There, they apprehended Yuan Shuangxi, a Yangzhou native, for selling heroin, and confiscated five and a half ounces of heroin. In the same room, they also apprehended You Zhifang, Chen Wuzi, and Wang Hanzheng, all natives of Changzhou, on suspicion of impersonating public officials, illegally exercising authority, and extorting money. They confiscated a pair of handcuffs, a police whistle, a training rope, and an appointment license. This morning, they were all sent to the First Special Court to apply for a postponement of the hearing to investigate whether the defendants had already committed extortion cases within the concession. The judge of the First Criminal Court approved the detention for one week.</p>

<p>Zhou Esheng, a local resident living at No. 24, Xinmin Village, Malang Road, is currently the accounting director of the Jiangxi Dayu Resources Committee. He has only one son, Zhou Zuomin (12 years old this year, studying at Fuchun Primary School in Lane 157, Luban Road), who is also adopted by four families, so he loves him dearly. At 12:20 PM on the of this month, he was taking his son home from school when a private car, number 7200, owned by Mr. Perrier Yuan of the Lujiawan Bus Company, driven by Peng Chaohua (35 years old, from Yancheng), sped by. The car failed to brake in time and knocked Zhou’s son down, resulting in his death. The police sent Peng to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, prosecuting him under Article 276, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The deceased's mother, Zhou Shuying, appointed lawyer Dai Jien to file a civil suit, demanding compensation of 15,280 yuan. The case was concluded yesterday morning by Judge Miao, who ruled that Peng Chaohua was guilty of causing death due to negligence in his profession and sentenced him to one year of imprisonment. The civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court.</p>

<p>A certain eyeglass factory at Nos. 8-10, Yunliang Fang, Fahua Bridge, Columbia Road, in West Shanghai, suddenly caught fire at 5:10 AM yesterday. The fire was very intense because the eyeglass materials inside were all made of tortoiseshell, celluloid, and other materials, which are difficult to extinguish once ignited. The fire quickly spread to the Meifeng Silk Weaving Factory at Nos. 11-12. The Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after about two hours. As a result, 96 bungalows were burned down. When the fire was at its height, two apprentices, Xu Fangshou (16 years old) and Shi Qingsheng (17 years old), jumped out of the windows, injuring their shoulders and arms.

<p>(From the Shen Bao of the Twelfth Year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>**On Building in Yin**</p>
<p>Heaven opened in Zi, Earth established in Chou, and Humanity was born in Yin. These are the Three Powers and the Three Beginnings, and the three dynasties built their calendar years differently, passing on the legacy. Confucius told Yan Zi that it was necessary to “follow the calendar of the Xia dynasty.” Why? The calendar of the Zhou dynasty built from Zi. As a commoner, Confucius dared not defy the orthodox calendar that was intended by the imperial court, but he saw that building in Zi and Chou was not as good as building in Yin. Yao ordered Yi and He to “respectfully impart the seasons to the people.” If you interpret the meaning of this, you can see that the important thing about the seasons is humanity. Therefore, the Xia calendar built in Yin, and the four seasons did not lose their order. Building in Zi and Chou would change winter into spring. The Qin calendar built in Hai, making the tenth month of winter the first month, and thus completely changing winter, spring, summer, and autumn. With Confucius' teaching, kings can take example. From the Han Dynasty onward, all used the Xia calendar, so the beginning of the year had a fixed system, and the meaning of humanity being born in Yin became clear. Although the Zhou dynasty used Zi, Duke Zhou created the *Erya* , where the names of the years also began with Yin and ended with Chou. Those who used the Heavenly Beginning were simply following the idea that the Three Kings did not follow each other, in order to clarify what each dynasty esteemed. To build in Yin as the proper way, they also could not have been unaware of the meaning of it. Only the beginning of the year should use Yin. Therefore, Jiazi is used to record the years, months, days, and hours, and the hour is used to clarify Yin. Heaven's time and Earth's time are not mentioned, but only human time is mentioned, because its meaning is tied to humanity. The year is renewed in Yin, and one must rise early in Yin. If we talk about the beginning and end of a year or the beginning and end of a day, then Hai is the end and Zi is the beginning, and the meaning of humanity's time will not be clear in the beginning of the year's Zi month, or the Zi hour of the sky’s dawn. Now let us speak of it in terms of humanity. From the beginning of the year to the end of the year, there is not a single idle day. The things that one does must be summed up at the end of the year. If things go smoothly, and the profit of the year is great, one will surely double the efforts in the coming year. If one's luck is bad and things do not go as planned, one must calculate how much has been lost and say that next year will be dangerous. It is my wish that everyone knows the meaning of building in Yin at the beginning of the year is in humanity's time, and to quickly plan for self-preservation.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Abolish a Few Bad Habits <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Little friends! Do you know that all kinds of prices on the isolated island are soaring like they're flying? I think all the smart little friends are figuring out how to save money. In short, at this time, you should no longer arbitrarily waste your parents' money. At the very least, from today onwards, you should eliminate the following bad habits if you have them, and encourage yourselves if you don't.</p>
<p>1.  Eating snacks: Eating snacks not only costs money but is also harmful to the body. You see, many little friends eat snacks all day long, leading to a sallow complexion and lack of nutrition. Proper and moderate eating is the only secret to obtaining health, please remember this sentence well.</p>
<p>2.  Reading comic strips: When little friends have free time, they often like to ask their parents for a few cents to rent some martial arts and supernatural comic strips from the small bookstalls on the streets; these kinds of books are absolutely useless to little friends, so they are also a waste of money. You may as well save the money you get and then go to the bookstore to pick out some practical and meaningful books, which will be beneficial.</p>
<p>3.  Scribbling on paper: Eight or nine out of ten little friends like to grab a piece of snow-white paper and scribble on it for a while, and then throw it away. Some even tear out pages from their exercise books without knowing how to cherish them: this bad habit is also not something that a good student should have. Wasting resources, this should be the biggest waste!</p>
<p>The above three points are almost the easiest to find among little friends. If one person doesn't have any of these three habits, then they are considerate enough of their parents. As for talking about how to reduce the burden on parents and increase the income of families, it is not something that you can do.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Dangerous Magnetic Mines Are No Longer Dangerous <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Anzhi</p>
<p>Little friends, if you have a good memory, you should remember that in the two or three months after the outbreak of the European War, newspapers often reported daily that British, French, or neutral ships had been tragically sunk after hitting mines. But the reason for hitting the mines was mostly due to encountering the magnetic mines recently invented by Germany, because these mines are equipped with extremely strong electromagnets and move freely on the sea surface. So when ships pass nearby, they can attract these mines, causing them to explode. To prevent the danger of these mines, scientists from various countries in Britain and France spent a lot of effort researching ways to avoid hitting the mines. Several months ago, they finally came up with a method to prevent these terrible mines. This defensive method is to avoid using steel-made machinery on merchant ships or warships, such as steam boilers, propulsion machines, engines, etc., and try to replace them with aluminum and other alloys. The key is to place two extremely strong anti-magnetic electromagnets at the bow and stern of the ship. Since similar magnetic forces repel each other, magnetic mines not only cannot approach the ship but instead move away. Now, large merchant ships in Britain and France are equipped with this device, so they can safely cross the dangerous Atlantic Ocean. As for why the machinery on ships cannot be made of steel, it is because these extremely strong anti-magnetic electric magnets can affect the rotation of steel machinery. It is said that German submarines have long been equipped with this kind of electromagnet, which also prevents the danger of their own mines. However, it was kept secret, and now Britain and France are also using this magnetic mine to step up the blockade of the German coastline, which can be said to be the retribution of warmongers.</p>
<h3 id="e112">The Bending of Light <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Su Ming</p>
<p>When the clock struck seven, whether it was a weekday or a holiday, Yong-er had already gotten up, washed his face, brushed his teeth, and drank a cup of salt water. This had become his habit. If one day there was no boiling water to make salt water, he would feel very uncomfortable and would wait until he had drunk it, or else he would rather skip breakfast.</p>
<p>Today, he got up, washed his face, and brushed his teeth. Then, he poured water into the cup with salt, and stirred it with a chopstick to make the salt dissolve faster. Who knew that today he would unintentionally discover another miracle—often when he put a chopstick into the water, it seemed from outside the cup that the chopstick was bent, as if it was about to break. He quickly took the chopstick out of the water, but it was still as good as new. He put it back into the water, and it bent again. He became curious and went to ask his older brother—Zong-er: "Why does the chopstick seem to bend in the water?"</p>
<p>"This is a physics principle of optics. Light travels in a straight line in the air, so we call it a light ray. But when light travels from one environment to another, it will change its path. This is a very strange phenomenon in nature. The question you raised is this phenomenon, because light rays travel from air to water, and air and water are two different substances, so light rays will bend. Why does light, when entering the water, not maintain its original direction and bend? This seems to be a mysterious thing. If you observe and experiment carefully, you can get satisfactory results."</p>
<p>"Then how can I experiment to recognize the path that light rays take and the phenomenon of bending? And light rays are colorless, tasteless, and odorless, so it's really not easy to experiment or observe." After Xi-er finished speaking, he saw his brother take a piece of tablecloth and a threadless spool (the kind of spool used for sewing clothes that can roll). Zong-er first covered half of the table with the tablecloth, and then said, "Let's use this toy as an example of the bending of light rays." As he spoke, he tilted the table and rolled the spool down from a high place. The spool was slanted, and as it moved to the edge of the tablecloth, it bent and traveled over the tablecloth. Zong-er continued to say, "This is because there is a difference in speed at the boundary. It is clear that the speed of movement on the table is greater, and when it moves to the cloth-covered part, which has a slower speed, the spool bends. The spool represents the light ray. From this experiment, we can observe the phenomenon of light bending. We can also answer why bending occurs. In short, the speed of light in air and water is different, so bending occurs. If the difference in speed is greater, the bending will be greater. If the spool rolled straight to the edge of the tablecloth, it would not bend. This phenomenon can also be compared to an army marching. If a line of soldiers is proceeding from flat, hard ground to uneven ground, it will definitely reduce its speed, because it must bypass the difficult-to-walk roads and tend to the flat road. The path taken by light rays is exactly similar to the situation of marching."</p>
<h3 id="e113">A Load of Cotton, A Load of Iron <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Shui</p>
<p>One Saturday evening, father, mother, older brother, and younger brother were all gathered together in a room, urging their father to tell a story. However, their father thought and thought, but couldn't come up with one. Suddenly, the older brother exclaimed, "Father hasn't thought of a story yet, but I have a question. Whoever can answer it has the greatest ability." Upon hearing this, the younger brother eagerly asked what the question was. The older brother said, "Which is heavier, a load of cotton or a load of iron?" Without a moment's thought, the younger brother replied, "Iron is heavier."</p>
<p>The mother, who was listening nearby, smiled and said, "Silly child, you fell for your brother's trick! A load is one hundred catties, so whether it's iron or cotton, if they both weigh one hundred catties, how can one be heavier than the other?" The older brother clapped his hands and laughed, "I knew the younger brother would say iron is heavier. Today, our teacher told us that the most important thing for a scientist is to be meticulous. When faced with a problem, one shouldn't answer rashly. Our teacher said that young people tend to give quick answers to problems, but they don't consider whether they're correct or not, and that's not the attitude a scientist should have."</p>
<p>The younger brother, after being told this by his mother and older brother, blushed and was almost about to cry. So, the father came forward and said, "I won't tell a story. Instead, let's talk about this question! A load of cotton and a load of iron, although both are one hundred catties, do have different weights, so the younger brother's answer isn't entirely wrong. For example, it has been raining for the past few days, and the air is very humid. If you weigh one hundred catties of cotton and one hundred catties of iron, they would indeed weigh the same at that time. However, after several days of sunny weather, the previously weighed one hundred catties of cotton, after being exposed to the sun for a few days, would weigh less than one hundred catties when weighed again, while the iron would still weigh one hundred catties. Wouldn't that mean the iron is heavier than the cotton? Conversely, if you weighed one hundred catties of cotton and one hundred catties of iron on a clear day and transported them to a distant place by car, and the car encountered a rainstorm midway, the cotton would then weigh more than the iron when weighed again. Therefore, although iron and cotton both weigh one hundred catties, their weights are different due to different climates and environments. So, it wouldn't be quite right to say that the younger brother's answer is wrong."</p>

<p>— Yi Mu</p>
<p>At that moment, he saw all sorts of vibrant flowers blooming on the rocks. Their five different colors were dazzling, the fresh green moss accentuating the star-like pale red flowers. The gentle and lovely gentian flowers were more pleasing to the eye than the sky's azure blue, and there were white lilies, pure white as if they were transparent. Red and purple butterflies flitted about, full of life. Looking up, he also saw thousands of auspicious rays of light shooting down from the sky. Ge Le, being in such an environment, felt happier than he had ever been in his life.</p>
<p>However, after he climbed up the mountain for another hour, he was unbearably thirsty again. When he looked at his water bottle, there were only five or six drops of water left, and he dared not drink any more. Just as he was about to re-hang the bottle on his belt, he saw a small dog lying on a rock, panting incessantly—this dog was the very one Hans had encountered earlier when going up the mountain. Ge Le stopped in his tracks and looked at it, then glanced at the Golden River, which was less than five hundred yards away from his destination. He considered walking past the dog and continuing upward, but he heard the creature whimpering pathetically, so he stopped again. Ge Le felt immense sympathy for it and said to himself, "Poor creature, if I don't help it now, it will surely die when I come down later." As he looked at the dog more closely, he saw the extreme misery in its eyes, making it unbearable for him to look any further. He stomped his foot and exclaimed loudly, "Damn the king of the Golden River! I absolutely don't want his gold!" Then, he removed the bottle's stopper and poured the remaining holy water into the dog's mouth.</p>
<p>The dog jumped up and stood on its hind legs like a human. In an instant, its tail disappeared, its ears gradually grew longer, shimmering like silk or the glow of the Golden River, its nose turned bright red, and its eyes gleamed. In just a few seconds, the dog was gone, and standing before Ge Le was his old friend—the king of the Golden River.</p>
<p>The king said to Ge Le, "Thank you, but don't be alarmed by this. You did the right thing." Originally, Ge Le thought that his loud curses just now must have been heard by the king's family, so he couldn't help feeling somewhat apprehensive, which showed on his face. The king of the Golden River continued, "Why didn't you come sooner? You let those two detestable brothers of yours come, forcing me to put in extra effort to turn them into rocks. They have become very hard rocks."</p>

<h3 id="e115">Interludes in "Liang Hongyu" <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Deng Erjing</p>
<p>The interludes in a drama must consider the effect of the drama; even a folk song should be inserted appropriately. Therefore, Gu Zhongyi carefully noted the intended purpose of each lyric in "Liang Hongyu." In terms of musical composition, one must also consider the performer's technique and various other difficulties. As a result, the interludes are attached to the play and cannot be appreciated purely from a musical standpoint.</p>
<p>The first song here is sung by prostitutes when their masters are drinking and making merry. Even "lascivious tunes" are acceptable, but due to the constraints of the lyrics and form, the music is written in the style of a folk song, with the task of enlivening the atmosphere left entirely to the singers and instrumentalists. It is not expected that the audience will imitate this way of singing.</p>
<p>The second song is sung by Liang Hongyu while dancing with a sword at the prince's command. The lyrics consist of three verses, with the meaning progressing from sorrowful to indignant, which moves Han Shizhong to draw his sword and dance and sing along.</p>
<p>A man should be determined to join the army, to kill all the barbarian bandits and protect our homeland!</p>
<p>The third song is sung by soldiers and civilians while building the city wall. The rhythm is distinct, like a march. It is sung in three verses. Although the melody is simple, the lyrics are enough to alert those who are still dreaming. Therefore, the lyrics are recorded at the end of this article.</p>
<p>"The wind blows, the rain falls, thunder and lightning bring forth sea dragons, breaking the walls, destroying the nests, houses shaking, shaking, unstable, afraid they will collapse, the whole family's lives are at stake! As long as the brothers are of one mind, we fear neither wind nor dragons, as long as we endure hardship and bear labor, we will protect our home with united hearts!</p>
<p>The wind blows, the rain falls, the cruel jackals attack the Song Dynasty, seizing our land, killing our compatriots, trampling on our China, Qin, Yan, Qi, Zhao, the country's fate is at stake. As long as the brothers are of one mind, we fear neither jackals nor leopards, as long as we are determined to fight to the end, we will protect our country with united hearts!</p>
<p>Horns blow, drums beat, the men of the whole country raise their arms and shout, we will not return to the court until we eliminate the barbarian bandits, we will recover our Central Plains and strike straight into the enemy's lair, we will cut the grass and eliminate the roots without mercy! The people of the whole country are of one mind, seeking life in death is true glory, knowing that when the country is broken, where can the home be safe, we will protect our country with united hearts!"</p>
<h3 id="e116">Technique and Soul <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Ti Gong</p>
<p>The play "Wen Ruyu" was performed by the Yifeng Drama Society two years ago for forty-two consecutive days. I watched it no fewer than ten times. The audience's opinion was quite satisfactory. However, I felt a bit strange at the time. It was a great tragedy, yet I had watched it so many times without shedding a single tear. Although I had been moved when reading the script, Jin Zhong'er, who played the most important role at the climax of the play, had a technique that was quite skillful and rich, as if she had achieved everything we had hoped for.</p>
<p>During the Qingming Festival this year, the Yifeng Society performed "Wen Ruyu" once again during the daytime. After watching it, I suddenly couldn't restrain my emotions, so I wrote down some thoughts. The following week, the Yifeng Society posted the play again. I asked Xinfang why they were performing this play, which had been shelved for so long, twice in a row. Xinfang smiled and said that it was specially requested by Mr. Hu, probably because he had seen my article. However, the performance that day was indeed unprecedented since "Wen Ruyu" had been performed. During the climax of the scene between Jin Zhong'er and Ruyu in the courtyard, the handkerchiefs of the ladies in the audience fluttered like snowflakes, and even the gentlemen were busy secretly wiping away tears with their fingers behind their backs.</p>
<p>This comparison made me deeply realize that an actor cannot rely solely on their technique. They must understand the playwright's psychology. When performing, they must forget themselves, put the soul of the character created by the playwright in the script into their own body, and completely transform themselves into that particular character. Only then can they arouse empathy from the audience and be considered an artist. If they only have technique and no soul, they are, at best, an artisan. The success of this performance of "Wen Ruyu" was because Jin Zhong'er on stage had already put Jin Jie's soul into her own body.</p>
<p>If there are those who have watched "Wen Ruyu" but have not shed tears, they may wish to watch it again to witness the significant influence of technique and soul on the effect of the play.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Wang Xichun <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>

<p>Conversations after Returning to Shanghai</p>
<p>Wang Xichun, the "Little Island Wang Xichun," has been in Hong Kong for over a month. Yesterday, she and her mother returned to Shanghai on the Debao Steamer. Originally, the small steamer was supposed to dock at the new customs wharf at two o'clock, where her father, Wang Jinrong, Ms. Zheng, Gong Jichuan, Wu Shan, reporters, and her younger siblings were waiting to welcome them. However, the ship didn't dock until 3:15. She was wearing a green cheongsam and a gray short coat. Upon seeing us, she smiled and waved. She was still as charming and lively as ever, but perhaps due to the fatigue of the journey and the sea breeze, her face was dark and thin.</p>
<p>I asked her how the performances were going there. She said, "The first half of the month was very good, but the second half was worse. Even Cantonese opera there rarely lasts more than ten days, let alone a month." Her father asked, "After apprenticing with Mr. Mei, what plays did he tell you to rehearse?" She replied, "The teacher often came to watch the plays and gave instructions at any time, pointing out how certain parts should be sung or acted." As she said this, she showed me a plum blossom painting that Mei Lanfang had drawn and given to her, inscribed with the words, "Xichun asks for guidance from me, and as she is about to return north, I have painted this for her." Finally, she smiled and told me that she learned to paint every day in Hong Kong and had painted many plum blossoms to give away.</p>
<p>As an aside, the film tycoon Wu Xingzai returned to Shanghai yesterday on the Zhibade Steamer, arriving an hour earlier than Xichun, but he had left a day earlier.</p>

<p>— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>The Legend of the White Snake is the story of "The White Maiden Repaying Kindness," which is widely circulated among women. Some people thought that the title "Legend of the White Snake" was not suitable for the times, so they changed it to "The Grievances of Leifeng Pagoda"—the protagonist, Bai Suzhen, was imprisoned at the bottom of the Xiaofeng Pagoda for eighteen years because of "Flooding Jinshan Temple."</p>
<p>"Bai Suzhen is said to be a white snake that has attained enlightenment; the maid Xiaoqing is a green snake; Bai had received great kindness from Xu Xuan in a previous life, so she transformed into a woman and dedicated herself to Xu Xuan to repay his kindness." This story is quite absurd, but fortunately, we are just "speaking nonsense and listening to nonsense."</p>

<h3 id="e120">Japan's Southward Advance Without a Clear Target <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Attacking the Dutch East Indies is a Diplomatic Probe, No Chance of Success under Anglo-American Surveillance, Southward Advance Dream</p>
<p>The slogan of Japan's southward advance policy has been shouted for many years, but it has no definite meaning and only represents a bizarre fantasy. Some believe that the origin of this fantasy is that the Japanese army wants to use it to raise its status, but this does not conflict with the fantasies of the Japanese army. The army's fantasies are already bizarre, crossing northern China to Persia, and crossing southern China to India, which have long been within their calculations. The former plan was somewhat restrained by international opposition, but this is a more distant and difficult road in the Great Asian Dream, and the hope of continuing to walk it is becoming less and less, so this part of the dream may no longer continue in reality. The latter plan, if it succeeds, will become a force driving the navy southward, and if it fails, it will still be a voice supporting the navy's southward advance. It seems that there are still opportunities to wait for, and during the waiting period, the navy's southward advance atmosphere should be released for testing.</p>
<p>Germany and Japan</p>
<p>The target of the probe is to resolve which side it should join in the European war. Superficially, Japan, which has always been regarded as a maritime power, should have a pivotal position between the two sides. It should be able to create opportunities, not just wait for them, but in fact, neither side gives it a chance to express its attitude, and it has almost been reduced to a non-essential position, so it can only wait in the end. The news that Germany will attack the Netherlands has made the Dutch East Indies a problem. It waits for the first opportunity, but the center of gravity is still on whether Germany will attack the Netherlands. On this point, Germany does not seem to feel the need to give Japan a hint, and on the contrary. Germany may also feel that if it attacks the Netherlands and the Dutch East Indies fall into the hands of Japan or Britain, it would be more unfavorable to itself than leaving them in the hands of a neutral Netherlands. The rumor that Germany will attack the Netherlands is already the third time, and the first two times were known to be propaganda from the British and French sides. This time it is still propaganda from the British and French sides, and it is also very likely. If so, the opportunity that Japan will use is just a strategy arranged by the British and French sides. Britain and France want to test the possibility of Japan joining the German side, and Japan has been tested and dare not clearly express this tendency. Although this is also leaving a way out, it is enough to show its lack of strength.</p>
<p>The Complex Relationship of the South Seas</p>
<p>Not only is it being tested whether Japan will truly advance southward, but it seems that tests are also being carried out to see if it can be forced to retreat further. This role is played by the United States. Japan must advance further south to conflict with Britain and France, but the current degree of southward advance has already surrounded the Philippines. Naturally, the goals of the United States are slightly different from those of Britain and France. Micronesia, which Japan administers on behalf of the United Nations, blocks the traffic between Honolulu and the Philippines. In particular, the important islands of Micronesia, Mariana and Palau, tightly control Guam and Yap Island, which the United States can never feel at ease about. In addition, on March 30 last year, Japan occupied the Tuan Sha Islands in the South China Sea, and on April 18, it extended to include the Xisha Islands. The significance of these islands lies purely in that they can be used as naval and air force bases. Although they are as close to Saigon and Sandakan as they are to Manila, the Philippines is close to Taiwan and sandwiched between Micronesia and the Tuan Sha Islands, which is more unfavorable than the British and French territories. Moreover, the defense of Britain and France can only be centered on Singapore. For the easternmost part of the Malay Archipelago, such as the Moluccas and New Guinea, they may not be able to take care of it all, while Japan has always paid attention to this direction and has repeatedly proposed buying Dutch New Guinea. If it cannot obtain it by trickery, it may eventually resort to forceful seizure, which will further create a situation of encircling the Philippines on all sides, which the United States naturally cannot help but curb.</p>
<p>Probing the United States</p>
<p>Although the west coast of Central China is a better target, the defense of the New Guinea area is obviously weaker, and looking at the map, this area is closer to Japan's administered territory and is directly south of Japan. The port of Darwin in Australia is on the same longitude as Nagasaki, and Port Moresby is on the same longitude as Tokyo. Japan is no farther from Australia than it is from Java. Japan may still turn to this side. Turning to this side and involving the United States will naturally encounter greater difficulties, but what great strength the United States declares it has prepared behind it is still something that Japan wants to test. But it does not conduct tests in this area, which further proves that it does not dare to advance southward on the Singapore side.</p>
<h3 id="e121">The Future of the Dutch East Indies: A Treasure of the World, A Target of Attack, Where is the Dutch East Indies Going <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The Netherlands and Portugal were both important colonial countries in the early modern period, and in modern times, they both have vast colonies with small homelands. In terms of homeland, Portugal is larger, and in terms of colonies, Portugal is also more extensive, but in terms of national strength, Portugal is far inferior to the Netherlands. The reason for this difference can be said to be entirely because the Netherlands possesses the world's richest East Indies archipelago.</p>
<p>The United States and the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>The essence of the Dutch East Indies lies in Java (including Madura). Java's area accounts for only one-seventh of the total area of the Dutch East Indies, while its population accounts for seven-tenths of the total area of the Dutch East Indies, that is, an area of 50,752 square miles and a population of 41,719,000. Compared with Zhejiang Province in China, the area is slightly equal and the population is twice that of Zhejiang, compared with the two islands of England and Scotland, the population is slightly equal, and the area is only half of the two islands of England and Scotland. Cuba in North America is similar to it in terms of situation and shape, with an area of nine-tenths of it and a population of only one-tenth of it. Therefore, Cuba's import and export trade is similar to Java's, but in terms of production, it is not comparable to Java. Cuba is already the pearl of the Caribbean Sea, and the preciousness of Java is simply indescribable. Theodore Roosevelt did not hesitate to launch the Spanish-American War for Cuba. This historical fact may be stimulating Franklin Roosevelt's heart, so in the current situation where German-Dutch relations are becoming increasingly tense, the United States has already boasted about protecting the Dutch East Indies. The final outcome of this event is still far away, but if the United States protects Greenland, it would have used the same method to deal with the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Britain and the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>On the other hand, Britain is not willing to be left behind in expressing its sense of righteousness to protect it, and has also issued a declaration. The Dutch themselves have declared that the East Indies themselves have the strength to protect themselves. Historical relations make us often feel that the Dutch East Indies is closer to Europe, but in fact London is 8,000 miles away from Batavia, while Los Angeles is only 7,000 miles away from Batavia. Los Angeles is only 7,500 miles away from Sydney, Australia, while London is 12,500 miles away from Sydney. Naturally, in the phenomenon of actual competition, the difference in distance is irrelevant, but this is very much a reason for the United States to believe that it has a deep relationship with them.</p>
<p>Japan and the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Japan, under the slogan of "Asia for Asians," is naturally also interested, but how it will deal with this problem cannot be accurately estimated. Alone against the United States, it can take a posture of fighting for the right to protect, but for Britain, it also needs to consider whether it is more worthwhile to take the name of joint protection. Naturally, in fact, the opponents it can compete with are the opposite, but under the situation of testing, the methods used are quite different. On its side, Britain's fight for the right to protect can be interpreted as a rejection of the United States as an hint to court it, and if the United States does not react much to this, its fantasy can indeed continue for quite some time, until Britain cannot take care of the East.</p>
<h3 id="e122">The Malay Peninsula as a British Imperial Defense Fortress <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The Malay Peninsula, located at the southernmost tip of Asia between China and India, extends 464 miles from the Siamese border in the north to Singapore in the south, and does not exceed 216 miles in width from the China Sea in the east to the Strait of Malacca in the west. Although its area is truly insignificant in the British Empire, it has three different statuses in its political organization. For example, Singapore, Penang, Malacca, and Labuan Island are directly administered colonies of the British Empire, collectively known as the Straits Settlements. Perak, Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Pahang form the Federated Malay States. Johor, Kedah, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Perlis are the Unfederated Malay States. These many places are all headed by the governor of the Straits Settlements.</p>
<p>British contact with the Malay Peninsula dates back to 1600. It gradually became a British colony after 1824, when Stamford Raffles of the East India Company made a treaty with the Kingdom of Johor. The Federation was established in 1895. Although the other five states did not join the Federation, they were also under British protection. After a century of operation, Singapore, which is located at the southernmost tip of the Malay Peninsula and is of extreme military importance, has become one of the world's twelve major ports. It is not only a fortress defending the Malay Peninsula, but also a breakwater for Australia, New Zealand, and the East Indies.</p>
<p>The political leaders of various places in the Malay Peninsula have also contributed greatly to the construction of the Singapore naval base. The Federated Malay States donated £2 million several years ago for the construction of a naval base. When former British King George V celebrated the twenty-fifth anniversary of his accession to the throne, the Sultan of Johor donated £500,000, and even the poorest Kelantan donated £20,000. The total amount reached £1.5 million. It can be seen that the natives of the Malay Peninsula have also contributed no small amount of effort.</p>

<p>— Bai</p>
<p>The development of Shanghai's national goods industry is certainly due to the efforts of national entrepreneurs themselves, but the assistance of the financial world to national goods factories over the years is also an undeniable contribution. After all, any factory that relies solely on its limited funds for operation, without the assistance of the financial world, will often find its business development limited by capital and unable to cope. Therefore, the financial world is to the national goods industry as water is to fish and green leaves are to peonies. The survival and development of the national goods industry truly depends on it.</p>
<p>As world warfare intensifies and foreign goods become unavailable, the demand for national goods from domestic and foreign customers has also increased with the anti-Japanese sentiment. This is truly a golden opportunity for the development of national goods. However, with the Sino-Japanese War in full swing, transportation in the interior is difficult, the source of raw materials is cut off, and the difficulty of transportation and sales is increasing. Meanwhile, the domestic and foreign markets' demand for national goods has increased several times over. To achieve mass production, national goods factories must increase their strength to cope. This is why the government has issued orders to the four banks to implement industrial loans as much as possible. I, as a reporter, have previously suggested using surplus floating capital to invest in national goods factories. I believe that there is a great deal of floating capital accumulated in Shanghai banks, and the enthusiasm of Shanghai financiers for loving their country and safeguarding industry has always been praised by the nation. In this era of thriving national industry, they should spare no effort to promote industrial loans to support the government's intention to promote industry. Although there are many ways to use funds at present, for the sake of supporting the national policy of resistance and reconstruction, nothing is more important than assisting national goods factories to produce as much as possible to meet market demand. If national factories have complete equipment but lack sufficient working capital to cope with the current special situation and engage in mass production, or if they are industries with great promise but need to strengthen their foundation, the financial world may wish to provide assistance within its capacity. Safeguarding national enterprises is a concrete manifestation of the financial world's support for the national policy of resistance and reconstruction. I know that the Shanghai financial community, which has always been known for safeguarding national industry and supporting the national policy of resistance and reconstruction, understands the direction of future efforts without needing my repeated urging.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Introduction to National Goods Factories: Daily Hygiene Necessities - The Manufacturing Process of "Double Ten" Brand Toothbrushes - "Not a Single Hair Pulled, Guarantee Replacement" - Outstanding Reputation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Wangshu</p>
<p>Since the eastward spread of European trends, Chinese people have become accustomed to modern and rational daily hygiene practices, such as brushing teeth, which is now extremely common. Toothbrushes are the main tool for brushing teeth. China initially did not produce them, but as demand increased, imported products became very expensive. Seeing this, Liang Rixin and Liang Risheng, brothers from Foshan, Guangdong, raised capital to start a home-based handmade toothbrush factory in their hometown three years before the founding of the Republic of China. At that time, they only rented a small shop on Shengping Street in the town as a distribution point. Because their products had the advantage of "not a single hair pulled, guaranteed replacement," they were very popular among the public. After hard work, their business gradually prospered, and to this day, branch factories have been established all over the country and abroad, and their products are sold far and wide in Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, becoming a giant in the domestic toothbrush industry. The Liang brothers' spirit of hard work, perseverance, and courage is truly the key to their success. The factory's development from its humble beginnings to its current large scale is a valuable reference and model for those engaged in the daily necessities industry. Therefore, I am happy to introduce it in this publication.</p>
<p>Brief History</p>
<p>A handmade factory was established in Foshan three years before the founding of the Republic of China, with a small output. After the revolution, sales soared, so production was increased to meet the needs of the Chinese people. A branch was established in Hong Kong's Dog Lane to promote products overseas and find a way out for national goods. In March of the ninth year of the Republic of China, General Manager Liang Risheng and Manager Chen Bingxia arrived in Shanghai and established the Shanghai General Branch. At the same time, a toothbrush factory was established in Guangzhou to ensure a steady supply for the various branches in their sales efforts. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, a mechanized toothbrush factory was established on Doulou Road in Ximen, and since then, the product styles have been innovative and refined, surpassing imported products. As of August 13th, there were a total of four toothbrush factories and fifteen distribution points in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Foshan, Hankou, and Suzhou, providing livelihoods for more than 5,000 workers.</p>
<p>After August 13th, some factories moved to the interior. A new factory was established on Dazhi Road in Hankou. During the Battle of Wuhan, it moved westward to Chongqing and established the Sixth Branch on the banks of the Jialing River. As for the two toothbrush factories in Ximen and Kunming Road in Shanghai, they were all moved into the concessions under difficult circumstances. At the end of the twenty-sixth year, a new general factory was rebuilt at No. A97 Xujiahui Road, producing an average of more than 10,000 toothbrushes per day. Before August 13th, sales covered all provinces and ports across the country. After the war, focus shifted to Southeast Asia and the Americas, because overseas Chinese love to use national goods, and foreign exchange is tight, making it easier to promote to foreigners. Overseas orders already exceed supply. The turnover in the ninth year of the Republic of China was only more than 20,000 yuan, but now it has exceeded 2 million yuan. The degree of progress is evident from this.</p>
<p>Manufacturing</p>
<p>1. Raw Materials: The main raw materials for toothbrush manufacturing are cow bones and pig bristles. Cow bones are produced in Sichuan, Hubei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, and other provinces in China, which normally meet the demand. After the war, due to transportation difficulties, raw materials suddenly became scarce. The cow bones currently used by various toothbrush factories include domestic products and some American products. Pig bristles are produced in Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and other provinces, with those from Sichuan being the best. Now, because the national government controls exports, the cost of raw materials has soared to more than seven times the original price, and the cost of toothbrush manufacturing has increased accordingly. Horse bristles are used to make toothbrushes only for the use of Muslim compatriots, while elephant bristles are rarely used due to their high price.</p>
<p>2. Procedures: The toothbrush manufacturing process is extremely complex, requiring more than eighteen steps: 1. Determining Length: Cutting cow bones of different lengths to the length required for the toothbrush handle. 2. Splitting Bone: Splitting the whole cow bone into several pieces. 3. Shaping Bone: Shaping the split cow bones. 4. Grinding Blank: Grinding the shaped cow bones into handle blanks. 5. Drilling Holes and Water Holes: Drilling holes for bristles and water drainage. 6. Aligning Holes: Aligning the drilled holes. 7. Grinding Head: Grinding the handle head into the desired shape. 8. Grinding Neck: Grinding the handle neck into the desired shape. 9. Opening Groove: Opening a water groove where the bristles are to be inserted. 10. Drilling Nail Holes: Drilling holes on the handle. 11. Bleaching and Disinfection: Bleaching and disinfecting the bone handle. 12. Polishing: Applying paint and polishing the bleached handle. 13. Inserting Bristles: Inserting the pig bristles. 14. Securing Head: Securing the inserted bristles. 15. Trimming: Trimming the lines of the inserted bristles. 16. Cutting Bristles: Trimming the inserted bristles to the desired height and angle. 17. Clamping: Clamping the bristles into sections. 18. Stamping: Stamping with a steel stamp mark. A complete toothbrush is thus completed. Steps 1 to 13 above are done by machine, while steps 14 to 18 are done by hand. Division of labor and cooperation make manufacturing very fast. If all the steps were done by machine, it would save even more time and labor. According to the person in charge of the factory, when orders are rushed, they manufacture day and night, and can produce more than 20,000 toothbrushes per day.</p>

<p>In the past week, managers of national goods companies from various places have come to Shanghai to purchase various national goods. The demand for national goods in the interior has greatly increased, but unfortunately, transportation difficulties are a serious obstacle to the transportation and sale of national goods to the interior.</p>
<p>With the outbreak of the war, industries moved inland, and the construction of industries in the inland provinces is also progressing day by day. According to recent investigations, wool weaving, rubber, cotton spinning, chemical industry, and other factories have been successively established in the interior. "The war has destroyed industries in the coastal areas and promoted the construction of industries in the interior. It is difficult to say whether this war is a blessing or a curse for China."</p>
<p>Chinese industrialist Liu Hongsheng has opened a large-scale Chinese wool textile factory in Chongqing. It is said that the machinery has been purchased and will be put into operation this autumn.</p>
<p>The Chongqing branch of Tianyuan Electrochemical Plant was put into operation in Chongqing on the 10th of this month. From then on, the important industrial raw materials needed in the southwest regions can be supplied by the factory.</p>

<p>— Junqing</p>
<p>"New clothes" are Western suits for women, and Western suits are "new clothes" for men. Both can be said to be the most fashionable and modern attire in this great era. Modern men and women, in this spring scenery like brocade, one with a handsome youthful appearance, and the other with a graceful demeanor, can indeed evoke a lot of envy.</p>
<p>The Dachangxiang Silk and Satin Store on Nanjing Road has a huge amount of wool fabrics and domestically produced textiles with novel patterns for new clothes. In terms of work, there is a self-established workshop for direct command and expert tailoring. Hundreds of new coats are produced every day. To expand the Western suit business, highly skilled technicians have been specially hired to be responsible for supervision. For Chinese-style clothes, a custom-made clothing department has already been established to supervise the production of men's and women's clothing on schedule. Recently, to meet the general urgent needs, they have pioneered express clothing, which can be delivered in three hours after being commissioned. This kind of trend-following action also shows Dachangxiang's serious service.</p>

<p>Regarding the standards for national goods, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce had detailed regulations before the war. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was established, and the standards for national goods were revised, still divided into principles for national goods and standards for national goods.</p>
<p>1. Principles for National Goods</p>
<p>1. Capital: All capital must be owned by Chinese citizens; however, foreign capital may be used as working capital when necessary, provided that it is not attached with conditions that hinder sovereignty. The right to operate, the right to do business, and the right to manage should belong to Chinese citizens.</p>
<p>2. Raw Materials: Domestic raw materials should be used; foreign raw materials may be used when necessary, but the foreign raw materials used should be limited to those for which there are no equivalent domestic raw materials that can be substituted.</p>
<p>3. Labor: Domestic workers should be employed; however, foreigners may be employed as technicians when necessary, provided that they are not attached with conditions that harm sovereignty. The foreign capital, foreign raw materials, and foreigners as technicians mentioned in the preceding paragraphs are limited to those who do not belong to the enemy during wartime.</p>
<p>2. Standards for National Goods</p>
<p>First Class: Chinese capital, Chinese management, Chinese labor, completely domestic raw materials.</p>
<p>Second Class: Chinese capital, Chinese management, Chinese labor, mostly domestic raw materials.</p>
<p>Third Class: Chinese capital, Chinese management, Chinese labor, mostly foreign raw materials.</p>
<p>Fourth Class: Chinese capital, Chinese management, Chinese labor, completely foreign raw materials.</p>
<p>Those who have the following circumstances will be downgraded, except with special permission from the government. The lowest grade is the sixth grade. (1) Those who have one of the circumstances under the proviso of paragraph 2 or paragraph 4 of the principles will be downgraded by one grade; (2) Those who have the circumstances under the proviso of paragraph 1 and paragraph 4 of the principles will be downgraded by two grades.</p>
