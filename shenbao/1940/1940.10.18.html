<p>社評</p>
<p>— 縦觀滇緬路開放之後</p>
<p>「白駒過隙，忽然而已；」每每只是銷沉的感慨，抑且未免無聊之甚。但如英國的屈從了日本，封鎖了滇緬路的軍需運輸，的期三月，迨至今日，却也告了屆滿。回想當初情景：日本方面趾高氣揚，好似扼人咽喉；勝算在握；英國政府含垢忍辱，議員在國會裏鬨責外交當局「可恥，實屬可恥！」法國苦笑，且以此爲爾後對於强暴繼續讓步，妥協，斷送的口實；德義從旁冷笑，世界輿情譁然，多以爲殆將促成不幸的後果；凡此種種，歷歷盡在目前，而現在則滇緬路又似受了不可抗違的自然律的支配而終於恢復其機能了。自今日起，行見大量軍需，蜿蜒萬山叢中，連綿小絕而入華夏；這在中英兩國人士以及中英兩國的國際友好，自必爲此欣然；然不能不歎息於時日駒馳而懊喪者，必有其人吧！制勝須借重時間，時間利於中國，屬於中國！</p>
<p>滇緬路恢復其活力之後，每日所得運入中國的軍火總量的自三百噸乃至五百噸。三五百噸非小數。日積月累則更有可觀；但在大規模的現代戰爭中，此數並非什麼了不得的大數，中國抗戰亦並非倚存之爲獨一無二的來源。吾人乃至一般世人所以異常注意於此路的通塞者，甚至旬日前美國方面有人且因此路復通關係而推論昨今兩日有在太平洋爆發戰爭的可能者，總之，重視之至於極點，決不爲了每日三五百噸的軍火運輸量，蓋別有其値得極度重視的意義在焉。舉言其意義之最顯著者：其一，有路而不通，是反常，是卑怯，是恥辱，是抑弱媚强的悖理謬舉，是文明與道德逆轉的動嚮，是强暴揚眉而正義淪亡的徵象：故不必計較通量的鉅細，所貴乎通，今則復通；何况日通三五百噸，爲量自不算小數。其二，在滇緬路封鎖的當初，乃至最近，英國方面不諱言於英日相的，由日本在這封鎖的三個月內促成中日戰爭的和解；夫和解貴乎平等而相齊，若乃用片面的封鎖來促成和解，則知其企求的標的，在於獨予另一片面獲得强制其對方屈服的機會；中國有其自信，故自始未嘗因此對於英國遽作無情的抨擊，現在過如日蝕，更不必說；然以往日的企求之下締的，復於今日的情狀之下解的，即此一收一放，恰將中國抗戰閱三四年，歷無數刦而依然不屈不撓，又將强制中國屈服的陰謀之終歸失敗，俱在萬目睽睽，極度車視之中，一正一負，作有力的說明。其三，英國當時屈從日本而封鎖滇緬路，笑駡由人，强顏而爲之者，事屬幫兇，詎其素願；亦無非懾於德國在歐洲大陸，連戰連捷，英倫三島，岌岌可危；雖英國當局大言炎炎，未嘗示弱，然證以對日卑屈，可知其意怯矣，氣餒矣，自虞其不克自保矣，遂惶恐而不敢堅拒日本的要挾，擋不住日本的恫嚇與脅迫；現在德國的攻勢，以及日本的恫嚇與脅迫，不但依然存在，抑且冉接冉厲，而英國不但小再接受要挾，不但不續作別種讓步。乃毅然決然，將屈辱的協定，及期廢棄；可知英國對於戰事前途，對於帝國運命，已能恢復其自信矣；英德兩國之間由交戰而分勝敗存亡，原屬局外人所不必十分關切，然自三國同盟成立之後，即不復能漠視其間的消長；故由開放滇緬路所映射的英國方面的信心，應　視爲含着異常的意義。其四，英國所以恢復其自信的因素，當然不止一端；然美國國策由堅强而更趨明朗，由蘊藉而演爲行動，由對英的同情默契而進爲公開的無限制的援助，由原則上的力援進而爲每一個別問題個別　目的具體應付，有如國務卿赫爾氏宣稱對於開放滇緬路的影響由美國担其責任，這是曖昧世界的破曉，這是有關大勢的偉舉啊！其五，恫嚇的虛聲，脅迫的姿態，經此滇緬路開放的事實試騐而成爲國際術數中的陳跡了；闢除這一類術數，大可便國際的這一方面歸於淸澄；今後猶得成爲問題的，必須是具有實際力量的實際新行動；雖恫嚇與脅迫的幻滅並不限制了新行動的發端，然新行動必以恫嚇與脅迫的失效而謹慎考量其必然的反應與後果；因此之故，自滇緬路開放後。吾人得推想明日與後日以及最近的將來，或將反而獲見表面上的沈靜，亦即暫時不聞何種幼稚的大吹大擂，　亦可想而知的乃爲各方從事於决一演變的安排與醞釀，以迄爆發何種突變。</p>
<p>由此五端，開放滇緬路之爲舉世所重視。五端之外，吾人猶有以爲別饒意義，但在今日不必加以論遠而堪供默察者，即儼然爲日本新型領袖的近衛，及其僚屬松岡，在力竭聲嘶，劍拔弩張、以冀阻撓滇緬路開放而卒歸失敗後、除了試行其炸不斷交通的無效轟炸。固將何爲？固將何以自維其尙未卓立的聲望威信？</p>
<h3>赫爾將發表演說　美鞏固遠東政策　積極與澳洲進行談判　加拿大禁止錫產運日</h3>
<p>華盛頓　國務院宣布、國務卿赫爾將於十月二十五日、就外交政策發表演說（十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間政府高級人士、繼續密切注意遠東之局勢、美國則加緊作鞏固其遠東强硬政策之談判、羅斯福總統接見駐華盛頓澳洲公使凱西氏、衆信渠等嘗檢討遠東之全部局勢、聞美·澳在太平洋之加緊合作問題、爲此决討論之要點、凱西氏嗣後拒絕說明渠曾吾與羅總統討論美國海軍之借用新加坡軍港一事、凱西氏語報界稱、「最好目下對此等事件不加特別提及」、以後澳公使復與國務卿赫爾作長時間之會談、衆信渠等係賡續數月前所開始之談判、當時英國建議由美國借用新加坡軍港及太平洋之其他海空軍根據地、此間消息靈通界之印象以爲遠東大部份美國僑民撤退後、目前之英·美·澳談話卽可澄淸、（十七日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>追念奧國精神病專家　華格納葉雷克敎授（三）　瘋人全身麻痹症的客服者  韓芬著　夏楚譯</h3>
<p>一九一一年，愛爾利虛發明魔彈，新希望又生。可是不久大家知道，潛伏在腦血管內部的蝶旋體，仍舊不受新醫療方法的影響。</p>
<p>華格納葉雷克遭受了卅年的失敗和灰心，最後於一九一七年六月十四日，他毅然決然替兩個麻痺病人注射瘧疾病人的血液，這樣可以代替細菌所產生的人工熱度。他自己有一次說：「一八八七年路上所留在路中的寳物，一直到一九一七年才檢起來。」</p>
<p>別的麻痺病人也跟着受同樣的注射，華格納葉雷克的方法使得已經落在致命的瘋在掌握中的病人，回復康健，恢復他們做人的尊嚴，使他們在社會上重新做一個有用的人。許多年以後，他最初所醫愈的兩個麻痺病人，已康健如常，能够自力謀生了，他們死中得生，在歷史上有了地位，大家都認他們是醫學界的骨董。</p>
<p>這發明家和他的學派，還下了幾年的苦工，才把新的醫療法建立起來。而且又化了好幾年的功夫，來探討如何消除生理上的危險和如何制止人造的傳染。新的困難發生了：「在沒有瘧疾的地方，怎樣培植瘧疾原形體呢？」一這種醫療法如果採用後，瘧疾就此蔓延起來了，那怎麽辦？」華格納葉雷克知道道些都是駡他「科學爲名，殺人其實」的標題。</p>
<p>這一切問顯結果部解決了，一切恐懼　慮却消失無蹤，懷疑家噤　無言，而全球數千萬的麻痺病人都霑受華氏瘧疾療法之福。爲了這，他受了諾貝爾獎金。</p>
<p>可是他的發明不止限於醫治全身麻痺症而已，它的仁慈的後果，推進得更深、層。華氏曾夢想要預防神終梅毒，使得可怖的全身麻痺還沒、發生的好幾年前，在梅毒的初期就把蝶旋體驅出神經系外，這個夢想也實現了。瘧疾療法只要用得時候適宜，指導正當，也成了一種預防的方法。</p>
<p>這樣華氏不但給精神病醫師一種武器，實在每個醫師都受了他的益處。他們的敵人—螺旋體—正潛伏着等待最後一擊，他希望他們能覺到這是摧毀敵人的機會。　（完）</p>

<p>昨日本市現金烚赤暗市驟吿升騰、價已飛出五千七百元大關外、查其主因、、軋空風潮擴大、外滙劇緊、致將各方人心激昂、上午因一般多實力者、尙不敢多頭活動、故某銀號與錢莊補空雖切、而證券幫金號出籠亦殷、故晨開五千六百七十元、後盤於五千六百四十五元至五千六百八十元間、無大波動、下午傳說利外、外滙緊勢突銳、銀號再補空如前、證券幫復進加碼繼後、散戶從事多頭活動、價頓飛躍直上、升至五千七百七十五元、終見獲利散多脫手稍回、收市五千七百三十八元、回漲九十八元、全日交易不旺、的四千兩、飾金升十元、達五百九十元、關金等均平、</p>
<p>烚赤軋百元弱</p>
<p>晨初雖外滙平靜、而塲內有買無賣、開盤價抬高數十元、計錢兌業進金號十兩、爲五千六百七十元、未幾滙市報硬、金號證券幫來售、卽遭挫落、計銀號塞予錢兌業二十兩、五千六百四十五元、但斯時某金號及錢兌業等進意甚殷、力購數十兩、價乃回高、計銀號進金號二十兩、爲五千六百八十元、再於證劵幫銀號吐塞下、重又向下、銀號塞予金號二十兩、五千六百四十五元、然近午刻、因外滙轉軟、賣戶减少、爲狀復昂、計銀號對做二十兩、五千六百八十元、收盤金號售予銀號十兩、爲五千六百七十五元、收後則喊五千六百九十元、午後開盤、銀號首進金號二十兩、爲五千六百九十元、此時銀號幫在撈、外滙亦緊、立出五千七百元關外、銀號入金號二十兩、五千七百四十元、後金號稍售、微撳數十元、計錢兌業出金號十兩、五千六百九十元、但銀號證劵幫聯袂扒吸、價乃猛跳、證券幫進錢兌業二十兩、已漲至五千七百七十五元、不意金號銀號等乘機大賣、致又回跌至五千七百三十元、然晚收證券幫入金號二十兩、已回升至五千七百三十八元、比上日軋漲九十八元、全日有一百三十元上落、現金號本牌金售出價、較烚赤高十數元、收進低三十餘元、現標金照掛牌低五十餘元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>餘金亦掛高十元</p>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出價、初時未更、午後二時半掛大十元、結果大同行懸六百九十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>烚赤籌碼缺乏　專做期貨</h3>
<p>烚赤暗盤市塲、處特殊環境之下、曾極一時之盛、經營此業及兼營買賣者、如雨後春筍、惟此種買賣、以現貨爲限、雖亦有買空賣空、而均有實貨準備、過去收解裕如、第因本埠游資充斥富有者及一般商人、莫不購金儲藏、更有暗中巨額搜買、現籌碼已感枯竭、同業收解竟然失效、故近日交易已極淸稀、上落相當擴大、因聞市塲當局將加改革、擬專做期貨、到期以結價方法交割、（灝）</p>
<h3>美票再漲</h3>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價、突然猛漲、英美金鎊因亦各漲二元、英金票仍鮮變動、美金票始曾退至十六元四角八分、旋卽步漲、午後漲勢允勁、一度抬至十六元八角半、又傳日美洋行間商業有於今日午夜暫停說、但卒爲十六元七角八分、比上日軋漲二角、香港票微漲一分、日金票及朝鮮票漲勢益勁、前者高至一元四角、後者升爲一元三角七分、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米大批卽到</h3>
<p>洋米定到不絕、市面繼續趨軟、整批七千五百噸將於明日抵申、且國外定價亦以滙宜產平劃低、昨日續有錦發售出一號西貢三百噸價七十七元八角、又二號五百噸價七十三元六角、建源售出一千噸價七十四元、在洋米定貨蟬聯之下、雖實銷與客囤趁平吸收、而市面終難支持、結果各洋米午前小二三角、午後則續小半元、交易淸淡、全日不足五千包、後形依然疲軟無神云、</p>
<h3>粉麥仍少進展</h3>
<p>粉市交易、仍鮮進展、因客幫並無實需、僅本街鬥市實銷、爲數亦屬不巨、蓋以各廠供給有限、終不能普遍供應、所以各粉號均以洋粉搭配、昨聞本街做開砲台脾及三角牌洋粉一千餘包、價爲十九元至上八元八角半、市因定貨到期有待、人心頗爲堅俏、老車牌回籠貨更以本銷專品、在籌碼枯蜴之下、竟扳俏至十九元一角、聞本街亦有二三百包交易、市面堅　如常、</p>
<p>小麥市况、仍鮮開展、因國內國外來源均難暢通、到貨稀少之下、售手扳俏異常、惟日廠雖有辦意、不肯放價、華廠則以運入租界因難、一時無法收購、聞市上沽價仍爲二十七元至二十五元、偶有成交、亦祇一二百包之零星點綴而已、</p>
<h3>證劵　外股重見蓬勃　內債轉形沉悶</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况愈形呆滯、午前稍有交易、午後祇甲丙兩種略有做開、餘竟無人問津、市塲空氣寗靜、昨日上午交易比較稍多、市價仍無變動、祇二十四號稍有賣出、恒孚稍有買進而已、午後交易愈見减退、甲種一個市價做開五千、丙種一個行市、做開三四萬交易、餘均絕無問津、市價結果高低互見五分一角而已、成交的共三十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交閘北水電股一百股、價爲七元正、日衆業股市開盤穩定、謠言雖仍繁興、業已被衆蔑視、下午市况轉趨硬化、過去蓬勃之象復又重見、信心似亦完全恢復、若形勢不變、市况不難再行進展、會德豐漲勢激急、荷印各橡皮公司股騰進亦猛、</p>
<p>倫敦十六日（週三）電　今日中國公債及遠東英商各公司司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、行情概無變動、邊洋行經理之英商上海銀公司、定於十十一月八日分一九四〇年份第二决中期股息、每股國幣一元、</p>
<p>滙通洋行經之之伯土安南橡樹公司、定價十月三十一日分派一九四〇年份中期股息、每股國幣一角、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗布市飄忽　抵盤時友人收進昨日行市又回升</h3>
<p>上日下挫之紗市、今則又復回漲、大有「紗瘧病」之象、乍升乍降、殊難捉摸、一半由投機者時進時出故也、蓋籌碼一緊、則迅速上升、之則向下跌、就此而論、紗市仍處飄盪不定中、不過實際銷路、依然寂寞耳、</p>
<p>現紗晨凱、人氣轉虛、但塲中抱開小盤拖進者仍顆、所以首盤又見上升、二十支雙馬價爲一千二百二十五元、少頃卽漲至一千二百二十九元、旋以多頭了結、搶帽子之輩拋出、又見下墜、至一千二百十八元、在二十元外至十八九元、盤旋甚久、忽落至一千二百十元、低盤一現、多頭大爲活動、新買者認爲迴勢已過、可轉好面、於是大家互相拉抬、你拖我進、直漲至一千二百四十八元、不料一霎間、跌去十元、收盤價爲一千二百四十四元、查半日問成交統計五千五百包、茲將各帮口買去之額量錄後、</p>
<p>香港二九〇同行五·一〇〇統計五〇〇</p>
<h3>棉紗外行投機　畢竟蝕多嫌少</h3>
<p>近一星期來、孤島的棉紗市塲上、顯得特別熱鬧、交頭接耳、叫囂紛呶、手中拱子的下注、各具目光、各顯神通、鈎心鬬角的市盤、有如閃電、呼吸上下、莫可捉摸、而逢低拖進、逢高吐出、可謂人同此心、心同此理、所不同的、惟感覺敏銳與遲鈍、判其優劣耳、敏的僭先、遲的落後、於是乎敏「賺」遲「蝕」、可是偶時也有相反的、敏「蝕」遲「賺」、雖說是目光不一、然亦在巧運如何耳、默察紗市塲上情况、「外行」投機者多、「內行」投機者少、外行之投慣外匯·外幣·金子·或米·麥·粉·者、有些感覺厭倦、因此見獵心喜的、冉來換了「棉紗投機」的口味、至於內行呢、因爲做期紗、吃過苦頭、當此國際局勢千變萬化之秋、還是脚踏實地、做做廠單（現貨）吧、（或代客、或自己吃進、）有多少財力、做多少交易、穩紥　打、倒也不失爲「識時務者」也、外行却多一味盲從、故賺少蝕多、其不被在濤沒頂者幾希、筆者於本月九日（上星期三）上午、代一蚌客某君雜糧鉅商）在某紗號做進雙馬期紗十包、價是中盤一千一百七十四元、當付證金一千五百元、做後曾回小到五六十元、客商似不耐、我勸他旣購之、則安之、且看十四·五日、（星期日後）必露鋒鋩、果然十四晨、開盤價就做到一千一百九十元左右、不料客商外行，太心急、諄囑我在八十元時賣出、可謂傻極、但是外行要搶先、亦是難事、好處終是內行占先、輪到外行、最好的是分潤餘瀝的了、穩妥朋友、還是少投機、（昭）</p>
<h3>大批印棉　抵埠起卸</h3>
<p>現棉情形　依然堅定、大家認為存貨趨弱、所以心思望好、茲據棉商云、前昨兩日拍電向海外購訂印棉額量已巨、且三星期可抵申、每担可盈利三四十元之譜、所以利慾一厚、有人冒險購定云、</p>
<p>另訊、外棉布價、紐約棉市、　初卽呈堅定之狀、後因投機者之購買、及華爾街股票價格高昂之影響、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起三五磅音不等、印度市况靜寂、昨日連同預測漲半羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、各方購意頗爲濃厚、同業凡藏有手貨者、竟不願出售、因之交易不多、一般同業對於原棉繼續看高也、</p>
<p>大批印棉到滬、昨日大英公司愛立浦（譯音）號輪、由孟買抵埠、運來棉花八千四百噸、的合二萬五千二百餘件、停靠浦東其昌　起卸、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆轉定</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、先因隔日天津豆在到存兩接之下（的連途中之貨有萬譜包）、有一部份貨主甩價兜售、致市氣疲憊小振、入後出口去路有港粤幫採辦靑島豆千譜包、因之疲風頓歛、大局得以站定、蠶豆銷塲本屬時過旺令、故刻下靑白兩豆不免分馳、靑皮去路近祗本街少數走動、發展難免乏力、白皮日商北運尙見熱鬧、所以湃勢頗樂觀、昨日商津幫採去茄皮蠶一千五六百包、（價詳市價欄）、本街問津各種靑皮蠶五百餘包、除高貨堅定外、餘均平疲如故、</p>
<p>又黃豆昨（十七日）有五千五百叫十包、由天津運來、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷赤開出七千包</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外匯見長、復現疲態、公會劃盤、現貨二四粗白本棧七十五元、小五角、外棧七十四元七角、小三角、轉口貨五十九元、小半元、荷赤現貨五十七元至五十六元八角、小七角、路貨五十六元六角、並有天祥洋行開出七千包、價爲美金二·五、OIF例、太古車白B嘜西棧七十三元、東棧七十二元牛、均小五角、DY嘜西棧六十九元八角、HX嘜東棧六十八元九角、小二三角、</p>
<h3>南北貨　滄州紅棗獻新　川耳高漲</h3>
<p>滄州紅棗、首批新貨業已到申、昨曾開出一百三十八包、價達七十五元、比前陳貨市價須加一倍之譜、</p>
<p>四川木耳、近以乏到、市勢頻緊、前曾叫五百元、未開者現已開至五百四十元、昨又叫五百六十元、</p>
<h3>油餅　生油再跌二三元　豆油市亦下墜</h3>
<p>昨日　糧油市、跌風劇烈、做開生油現貨、再跌有二三元、計開膠州生油數十桶、價爲七十二元半至七十四元、至豆油市况、因市存充沛、祇少數人之把持、市成虛緊局面、一有壓力、市卽不支、做開大有廠油價爲八十五元、又昨（十七日）有生油二千九百八十聽父三百五十件、並豆油五百件、俱由靑島運來、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布投機活躍　售盤漲跌靡定</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市盤旋、晨跌午回、蓋以目下市面投機活動、實際交易、價高漲後卽有放出、逢低又來拖進、故售盤倐忽之間變動迅速、晨市細布斜紋每疋跌二角半至五角、近午回漲五角左右、粗布漂染布開價不動、囤戶活動、午後又盛、本街成交粗細布色布及府綢色丁等坯布及印花貨一千餘件、實銷仍形平淡、粤港幫辦色布色斜等三百餘件、烟臺幫辦重磅粗布等近二百元、</p>
<p>東布　先平後漲、形勢殊堅、十二磅龍頭細布晨開三十七元六七角、嗣以同業及囤戶進胃甚强、市氣轉緊、喊盤頻漲、龍頭細布收盤每疋升至三十八元一角半、四君子嗶嘰每碼一元一角五分七五、</p>
<h3>呢絨衣裝步步抵　——銷路反比以前旺——</h3>
<p>自穿西裝者夥、呢羢毛棉織物、銷路隨之而廣、不論男色女色、莫不較戰前爲多、因物價高漲、遂使申織本廠呢羢爲普及、在目下呢羢市塲上占最優勢、又鑒於各馬路服裝店生意、邇來則以大新街及里街內之包袱裁縫、營業較盛、霞飛路·四川路·南京路一段服裝店、營業則均較春季爲减色、高等買主翻落中等、中等買主翻落下等、大半齊感乏力添製新衣等之故、</p>
<h3>五金　平摺鐵實銷動</h3>
<p>平摺鐵實銷、自長江幫停辦後·卽受一重大打擊·及前昨因本街製罐廠·玩具廠·香烟廠·以及機器工廠等、稍有採納、市面略見起色、惟人心因成交不廣、行盤依然穩站於舊價、如揀貨每二百磅（合二扎）售一百五十元、决花色則每箱喊一百三十元光景、查昨市實銷數的百餘箱光景、</p>
<h3>靑鉛平定　鐵坯漸昂</h3>
<p>靑鉛市面、因來源不濟、而交易亦淡、故未顯如何高低、查昨由洋莊幫稍見進意、聞喊價仍在一百十元左右、</p>
<p>鐵坯交易、前昨由熱水瓶廠吸收數十紮、此外印鐵廠製坯廠亦時見搜進、故市不寂寞、人心亦因之優秀、行情漸見高昂、蓋昨市之成交價、已達每紮一千一百元、而同業之喊價、尙須一千一百五十元至一千二百元不等耳、</p>
<h3>絲茶　外銷絲仍萎縮</h3>
<p>昨日絲市突形轉跌、允以美市更見軟弱、計紐約近期跌去五分、較前二日跌去一角四分、遠期跌三分半、較前一日跌一角一分、橫濱昨節日封關無市、但本埠洋行吃價乃轉萎縮、然目下無錫生絲運滬費用、每包當在六百元左右、再加上特捐一百十元、担負並不見輕、故申埠持價尙堅、昨未聞有交、</p>

<h3>當舖門前</h3>
<p>— 水冗</p>
<p>你見過一個堂堂七尺的男兒掉眼淚嗎？</p>
<p>我見過一個。就在今天。他一根木頭似的獃在一個當舖的門檻內，手裏揑着一張當票，大顆的淚珠順着他的瘦削的臉掉下來。掉下來。</p>
<p>在他的背後是那個大得可怕的「當字。</p>
<p>（是不勝精明的朝奉的剝削嗎？是爲了當貨的代價換不到升斗的米嗎？是天寒怯衣單，却無力贖取夾衣，棉衣嗎？）</p>
<p>瘦削的臉和藏在藍布短衫下面的肩胛抽動着，抽動着。</p>
<p>但我聽不到他的哭聲。我也分辨不淸那是吾由於他只在飲泣，還是它給都市的騷音呑沒了的緣故。</p>
<p>街上，公共汽車轟響着。汽車嗚嗚着。黃包車推擠着。人們也推擠着。在街上，在人行道上。這樣形成了一條生活的河流。流着，流着。大家掙扎着：推人，被人推，每個人懼怕落後，懼怕做滓渣。</p>
<p>好多人從那個當鋪門前，那個工人面前跑過去了。沒給瞥一下的跑過去了。</p>
<p>每個人顯得那麽慌迫的，自顧自的；沒有同情，沒有互助！</p>
<p>「兄弟，你怎麽了？」我的嘴脣在翕動，我想這樣的對他喊。</p>
<p>但突然，一個骯髒的身子撞了我個滿懷，又溜過去了。跟蹤而來的是皮靴聲和呼嘯的皮鞭！</p>
<p>我吃了一驚，跑開了</p>
<h3>提倡火葬</h3>
<p>— 肇戟</p>
<p>據報載：「本埠自形成孤島後，居民稠密，屍體棺柩亦較前增加，據工部局統計，目前上海因人口擠居，致死人之數亦增，上月內經火葬屍體共計二·二八七具，寄柩則達三九·一〇七具云、一</p>
<p>我們姑不論火葬屍體以及棺殮屍體，合計起來，在上月份竟有那末的許多，然而這却是個事實，卽：棺殮的有三九·一〇七具，而火葬的有二：二八七具：棺殮的無論如何是佔到多數。可是我們却也不能忽視，火葬的却也有了二·二八七具了。</p>
<p>在我們這風俗習慣的社會，人死了要是去「火葬」，這眞可說是件非同小可的大事件了。和尙圓寂了，坐在大缸中要焚化，是當作一件有趣的事情趕去看熱鬧的；而若有人問到他死了也去火葬好麽的話，那他就要大爲反對了，「我又不是和尙。」年長的如果子孫要把他火葬，那更目爲大逆不孝。其實，這還不是迷信在作祟，認爲人死了還是有「靈魂」的，人之覺知，就是因爲有「靈魂」的緣故，因此肉體雖僵冷，如若要焚化，那是很痛苦的。至若和尙圓寂焚化，那是道巳修成，而昇天去了的緣故。</p>
<p>其實，古時本無棺本，人若死了就棄之於壑的，至虞時始用「瓦棺」，夏時用「堲周」，然也都以土而不用木的，直到殷代始用木棺。可知以棺木盛屍體，原不是一件什麽大不了的事件，只是後人爲一保善屍體」而鬧玩意兒吧了。然而「屍體」究能保得完善麽？還不是經過若干時候要腐爛掉的麽？所以我說：人死了也就算了，放一把火燒掉是很乾脆不過的事。我常對友人說的：人的一生，有三樁戲劇要做，出生了，做「彌月」，父母把你抱出抱進，供人欣賞。到了成年結婚了，那更是「大一喜劇」。比至老死，還要把你玩弄一會，現在有殯儀館了，那更把你打扮得如活着一般，我總覺得這是戲劇，不過是悲」的罷了。</p>
<p>其實「火葬」也不是近時的「發明」呀，宋時就已經很「盛行」了，這是有「史」可靠的事實，誰都不能否認的。火葬除了乾脆以外，還有一種好處，是可以使田畝少爲「死人」所據，咱們中國人的田畝間，隆隆地一堆一堆的，全省墳頭，要是再過五百年一千年，豈不是田畝要全爲「死人」所佔據了麽？所以火葬就可以騰出許多可耕種的田畝來，以增殖生產之用。</p>
<p>上月份的火葬數字竟也有二·二八七具，而我想是因爲上海形成孤島的緣故，逼不得已的事！可是我却要向大家提議，（這提議又有誰肯接受呢？）提倡火葬，除了乾脆以及少爲「死人」佔田畝外，還有，屍體焚化了，總覺得「衛生」得多。目下各物昂貴，棺材當也不能例外，窮人卽使要死，也「死不起」，所以火葬旣可省錢，而實在也免得盛殮在蹩脚的棺木裏，給活着的人們一種傳染性的威脅。</p>
<p>我提倡火葬，上海應該有個專門火葬的「殯儀館」（我不知道這名字恰當不恰當）。</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>第九章　駕人消息</p>
<p>我在靑蒲路二十七號門前停車的時候，瞧見大同路的轉角站着一個身材瘦小穿黑衣的人。這人一瞧見我下車，就慢慢地走開去，模樣兒有些可疑。這個人好像是派在那裏監視的探夥，不過我不認識他。我並不顧忌，就推開了那盤花的鐵門走進去。那鐵門虛掩着，我推門時動作很輕，走到裏　，也不見人。客室中的黃紗窗帘密密地下着，靜悄悄地沒有聲息。我先向右手裏老毛的門房瞧瞧，那門關着。我就直接走到門房門口，用手指在門上彈了兩響，沒有回音。我順手把門鈕一旋，也是虛掩着沒有下鎖。老毛不在裏面，那雙汚舊的黃皮鞋，却留在一隻小方桌的底下。我走進去拿起一隻皮鞋一瞧，鞋底上已有一個洞，我從衣袋中摸出軟尺來一量，果眞是十一寸六。</p>
<p>這個發見，又不能不使我感到驚喜。原來這老毛也是有關係的！可是我剛才把皮鞋放在原處，回轉身來，正要退出門房，驟然間瞧見那頭髮花白的老毛正站在門外，一雙小而圓的鼠目，驚與地向我凝視。他的脚上已換了一雙黑嗶嘰蒲鞋面鞋子。接着他張開了缺齒的嘴脣向我開口了。</p>
<p>「先生，你—你—」他分明要問我在他房裏做什麽，却因着有所顧忌而不敢直截地晚出來。</p>
<p>我答道：「老毛，我來我你。」</p>
<p>「找我？有什麽事？」</p>
<p>我覺得有些難於回答，我當然不願把察騐他的皮鞋故事就吿訴他。我含糊地說：「你在裏邊做什麽？」</p>
<p>老毛等了一等，答道一我在接電話。有個鮑玉小小姐，來的王小姐又麻雀呢—這鮑小姐也是王小姐的好朋友，伊還不知道王小姐已被人打死。我把這訊息吿訴了伊，伊說就要到這裏來哩。」他頓了一頓，向我瞧瞧，似覺得我不很注意他的報吿，便重新提出他先前的問句。「先生，你要我我做什麽？」</p>
<p>我隨意應道：「我要叫你去通知一聲你們的李老爺，請他下樓來跟我談幾句話。」</p>
<p>老毛的鼠目仍釘住在我的臉上，好像覺得我的答語是隨意扯出來的。他分明懷疑我走進他的門房裏去，一定有什麽作用。他搖搖頭說。。「先生，你要見李老爺？他不在樓上了啊。」　（一三九）</p>
<h3>爲流行熱病公告社會人士</h3>
<p>— 章巨膺</p>
<p>登革熱一千七百九十年始在爪哇等處發見流行，後盛行於熱帶，的四十年前，菩國汕潮厦門等處有劇烈之流行。大的近海之地方患之，其流行迅速而普泛。爲流行病之巨璧。病之傳播由於黃熱蚊，其言熱弛張起落之狀甚詳，初形寒發熱，爲前驅熱陣期，在此期內熱漸升，至第三四日達最高度，繼則出汗，腹瀉，發熱間歇，病者感疲弱，高熱既退，自覺略愈，此所謂間歇期，或無熱期者是也。自十二小時以至於三日，久暫不定，繼則熱陣又起，熱度且更高，而入終期熱陣，或稱第二熱陣。在此期內，痛狀又顯，或且較前更苦；至於發疹，初面紅漲，面皮顯充血性斑樣點，（有時或僅顯血色痕）此所謂初疹；繼則大多數發疹，（有時或在間歇期內發顯）此所謂末疹；此疹無定狀，或如斑疹，或與痳疹者相似，或散漫與猩紅熱者相類，或似丘疹，或似平扁苔癬者，大份似痳疹者爲多。</p>
<p>以上所言，爲登革熱標準病型，外此有不合以上標準，而實係此病者，一不顯初疹，二或有體溫不甚高者，又此病併發他病者不多，但小兒或有驚厥者，或有兩星期後回歸再作熱者，或誤治而致變病者。</p>
<p>此非國貨病，乃舶來品病，然西醫亦多忽略，未曾注意，或檢查白血球减少而以爲傷寒者，然高熱脈遲，騐血無韋氏反應，熱型弛張作陣，然後知傷寒非是也。或疑係痲疹者，然鼻無卡他，無科氏斑，疹先見於面部，則痳疹亦非是也。或係猩紅熱者，然猩紅熱脈數咽炎，白血球增多，又大不同也。以西醫診西病，尙似疑不能診斷，何况醉生夢死討生活於豆豉豆卷之市醫所能治療邪？不佞非自矜創獲，特以病非重證，吿社會人士，毋盲人瞎馬，輕於進藥，願平安如意之病始終平安如意焉。（完）</p>

<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒的遊戲室</h3>
<p>— 怡</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒脫離影壇後，關於她家的經濟方面外界仍不免有些刻薄的批評。允其是一種訛傳，說：毘連她家住宅建造的一所游戲室，是作爲博物館，預備供人觀覧而收費的可是事實上並非如此，那座屋子是造起來作爲秀蘭儲藏她的玩具，幾百個洋囡囡和影迷們送給她的禮物的。秀蘭的一切宴會，以後將在這裏　舉行。或許就因爲她玩偶室每年開放兩决，便有了上述的誤會。不過，今後每年將在這屋子裏舉行兩决慈善募捐：一决是爲「電影界救濟基金」，另一决是爲兒童醫院。</p>
<h3>病候初度觀劇記</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>余因病入院療養後，已四月未曾握管，往黃余觀劇，尙屬病後第一遭也。新艶秋，茹富蘭之劇藝，均已十數年未嘗寓目，况首夕之「探莊」「碧玉簪」又爲二伶之成名傑作，故特於七時前趕至，恐富蘭之「探莊」有未窺全豹之憾也、前聞富蘭眼疾影響，已改習小生，余不勝惋惜。殊知渠演此唱作繁重之武小生戲，不特工架更覺穩練，即後來與下手張連廷之開打，亦複嫻熟敏捷，精彩百出，有幾處全塲掌聲雷動，博得內外行一致推許，允以兩人各持槍捧之一端，同時翻筋斗之表演爲最難能可貴。海上名武生李春來演白水灘」時，恒有此絕技表現於觀衆之前，富蘭翻時亦甚靈敏美觀，足見其功力深矣。舊京武生行中，尙。楊，俞諸前輩後，惟富蘭爲最守規矩，最下苦工。曩歲諸前輩猶不時出演，無不體態雄偉，如周瑞安者，偶飾項羽，尙有小霜王之譏，以致富蘭頭受抑，雖會數度南來，然均為能大紅，今則老伶凋謝，如萬春，盛麟輩，身材，工力，皆不違富蘭者，猶得備受孤島人士之熱烈歡迎，何况彼之資格較深，嗓音於武生，武小生，俱各相宜，崑亂不擋，不失老派典型。茲於打泡第一日竟博得唯一好評，吾想潦倒十餘年之富蘭，亦必稍覺快慰，足徵有眞才實藝者，終必有揚眉吐氣之日也，「探莊」後爲周嘯天之「空城計」大致小差，較之第一决隨小雲南下時，確已大有進步，惜嗓音仄細，爲天賦所限，座位稍遠者，聽時頗覺費力，然能力自振作，再下苦工，他日亦甚有希望也。新艷秋學程最早，舞台經騐豐富，且色藝俱佳，作工細膩，殊不媿為坤伶祭酒。益以俞振飛之小生，儒雅風流，態度大方，更為新伶生色不少，故「全部碧王簪」亦極受台下歡迎。是日散塲時間，雖較往日略遲，而路遠者又無電車可乘，但全塲觀客均聽至劇終時方始離座以去，於此亦可見艶秋之魔力矣。</p>

<h3>「秦淮世界」的劇情</h3>
<p>— 嫋嫋</p>
<p>金星第一部出品「秦淮世家」業已攝成，並定最近期內繼「梁紅玉」而在金城上演了。在今天所謂無聊片紛攝的浪潮還未全退盡的時候，金星將張恨水的文藝作品搬上銀幕仍是不失爲進步的。以「秦淮世家」之擁有廣大讀者，對改攝之電影必更感最高度興趣，預計當可轟動一時的。</p>
<p>恨水說部，向以情節見長，在「秦淮世家」中人物的描寫與佈置上是更見趣味萬分。不同性格的男性和女性，在筆端已足引人入勝，如今搬上銀幕有着更活動的表演；緊張處使人胆戰，凄艷處使人心酸，激昂處令人豪邁，輕鬆處令人捧腹。穿揷的故事則有歌壇的羅曼斯，豪强的凌弱史；更有拾金不味的正直人物；行竊養母的仗義好漢，爲母賣身的伶仃孤雛，玩弄男性的玲瓏嬌燕，帮閒生非的爺們，二敎九流的人傑。刻劃性格有出似猛虎的强梁，有馴服如羊的弱者，有反抗權威的女性，有智慧絕頂的姣娃。論噱頭有狠天狠地的三劍客，有隻身鋤惡的女英雄。談人物，有麻子，禿子，蹺脚，測字的，擺小書攤的，歌女，交際花，私娼，拆白黨，混混兒，大亨，談情節有遇豔，行竊，兩刦女娃，數探魔窟，手誅惡覇，火焚巨宅……</p>
<p>由於該片是大抵舞台劇人串演的，在演技上更把劇情誇張的介紹出來，使觀衆更爲激發。總之，這是値得介紹的一部鉅作。</p>

<h3>The Chinese Government Receives Official Notification from the British Side: The Burma Road Resumes Transportation Today; Hundreds of Loaded Trucks Stand Ready, Equipped with Military Supplies to Enter China; a Japanese Newspaper Claims the International Situation Has Reached a Most Important Juncture; a Japanese Military Officer Declares Bombings Will Be Carried Out</h3>
<p>Chongqing: The British government has decided to reopen the Burma Road as scheduled. The Chinese government has received official notification from the British government that the road will resume transportation on the 18th. Zeng Jue-long has been ordered to go to Yangon to preside over matters related to transportation; it is said that no ceremony will be held. (Dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Yangon: According to news from Lashio on the Sino-Burmese border, hundreds of loaded trucks are now preparing to simultaneously transport military supplies into China when the Burma Road reopens today. Transport workers are loading goods day and night. The rainy season has passed, and the road conditions are good. Taking advantage of the moonlight this month, the trucks will be able to travel the 700-mile road to Kunming at a suitable speed, pressing on with all possible haste. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: On the eve of the reopening of the Burma Road, the Chinese authorities here are preparing to rapidly process thousands of tons of military supplies that will be transported north from the Burmese border. Thousands of transport vehicles, which are extremely important for military supplies, are currently stationed in Lashio, awaiting orders to move north. The vehicles are loaded with supplies from Britain and the United States, which accumulated in Yangon and other parts of Burma during the period when the Burma Road was closed. It is said that during the closure, the Chinese authorities made efforts to increase the road's capacity. (International News Agency dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Asahi Shimbun believes that the reopening of the Burma Road is a retaliatory move by Britain and the United States against the Tripartite Pact. It will issue a warning today, stating that if the British authorities disregard Japan's attitude and use Hong Kong as a base for anti-Japanese activities, the Japanese government will be forced to adopt "appropriate and effective strategies." The newspaper continued, stating that the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong has already visited the Hong Kong authorities to urge them to pay attention to the fact that goods prohibited from transport on the Burma Road also apply in Hong Kong. Although the British currently believe that the reopening of the Burma Road also takes effect in Hong Kong, according to the Anglo-Japanese Agreement, items prohibited from Burma do not simultaneously expire in Hong Kong. The Kokumin Shimbun claimed that after the reopening of the Burma Road, international developments will reach a most important juncture, for this obstacle given to Japan by Britain and the United States will also be a touchstone for Japan's determination to quickly end the China Incident and establish "Greater East Asia." The situation of merely posturing is over, and now action is needed to urge Britain and the United States to awaken. (United Press dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Hanoi: Colonel Nakatsuchi, head of the Japanese Naval Commission in Vietnam, told a United Press reporter here today that Japanese aircraft in Vietnam will bomb a section of the Burma Road within Chinese territory tomorrow morning, weather permitting. It is said that Japanese aircraft will destroy the Burma Road as quickly as possible after it reopens. The main goal of the Japanese naval representative here is to establish an air base for bombing China. As for air bases in Vietnam, Japan needs to increase them in addition to Haiphong. The French authorities may agree on this point, because since Japan allied with Germany and Italy, the Vichy government has been under the control of the Hitler government, and Germany will be able to make France cooperate with Japan. Nakatsuchi also said that Japan would not attack Hong Kong, calling Hong Kong "a rotten apple." Japan does not need to shake its trunk to make it fall, nor does it maintain fruit. (United Press dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japanese newspapers today prominently published the news of the Burma Road's reopening at midnight tonight. Japanese newspapers said that Japan "is watching the development of the situation with a calm and stern attitude, because Japan is firmly determined to reduce the assistance of third countries to the Chongqing government." Recently, Japanese newspapers have not paid attention to the expansion of the United States' military power, only publishing a short message about the registration of 16.4 million Americans for military service yesterday. Roosevelt's speech on "Registration Day" was also given unimportant attention. The Asahi Shimbun, which usually publishes lengthy special dispatches from Washington and New York, also did not publish any news about American defense today. (United Press dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Yangon: Chinese diplomat Zeng Rongfu, who is now in Yangon for the reopening of the Burma Road, told a Reuters reporter that most of China's war necessities now come from the United States. Although the United States is engaged in a great war, it is also doing its best to help China. What China urgently needs now are heavy artillery, aircraft, and anti-aircraft guns. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Newspapers prominently published on the front page the news that the British government intends to lift the ban on the transport of arms, bullets, and other supplies to China via Hong Kong, along with reaction news, hinting that the Japanese government will take strong measures to deal with it. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>London: According to responsible sources in London, the Hong Kong-China route was closed by order of the Governor of Hong Kong in January 1939 for security reasons. No guarantees were given to Japan before the Burma Road Agreement was concluded; a guarantee was only made in that agreement. Therefore, since the Burma Road Agreement expires today, Britain's guarantee regarding Hong Kong also ends simultaneously. The order to close the road will continue and will be entirely at the discretion of the Governor of Hong Kong, because the importance of the Hong Kong route is limited due to the geographical position of the Japanese navy and army. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>London: According to unofficial sources, the Burma Road, which has been closed for three months, will reopen today, but military supplies will continue to be transported to China. Although there has been no official announcement, well-informed sources claim that when the Burmese government rescinds its order to close the road, the transport of arms will resume, because the aforementioned order was issued on the advice of the British government. Therefore, it is generally believed that it is only a technicality that will be quickly resolved. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Well-informed sources here believe that the Japanese side will not only bomb the Chinese section of the Burma Road but also bomb Hong Kong if it resumes arms transport to China. Both routes, "west" and east, are within easy reach of Japanese bombers. The Japanese side will issue an "important declaration regarding the situation soon." (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Lashio: Sixty of the first batch of trucks will drive to the Sino-Burmese border seven minutes after midnight tonight. Twenty minutes later, other trucks will follow. It is expected that all 200 trucks will be transported out before dawn. (United Press dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Lashio: Preparations for reopening the Burma Road at midnight tonight to transport military supplies to the Chongqing government have been completed today. Midnight tonight marks the expiration of the three-month Anglo-Japanese agreement to close the Burma Road and the beginning of Britain's new, stronger policy towards Japan. According to Chinese sources on the Burmese border, military preparations to protect cargo transport on the Chinese section of the Burma Road have been completed, and it is expected that the Chinese section of the road will be attacked by Japanese aircraft by dawn. Also, Chinese officials here recently stated that the Chongqing government has taken appropriate measures to protect the Burma Road from Japanese bombing, and said that the Japanese will have to attack the targets along the road from a very high altitude, which would likely result in inaccurate bombing. A Chinese official said, "We are not afraid of bombs, and the trucks must pass through." With the permission of the authorities, reporters visited various warehouses and loading areas today, and learned that the first step is to transport a large amount of accumulated military supplies to Chongqing. In one loading area, reporters saw 2,000 dark gray American trucks being loaded by 5,000 workers of different nationalities. Under the scorching midday sun, Indians, Chinese, Thais, Burmese, and Miao people hummed and sweated as they carried weapons and other military supplies into hundreds of American trucks, preparing for departure at midnight. Large signs reading "No Smoking" and "No Photography" were posted everywhere in the loading area. The Chinese official said, "Our slogan is to engage in all preparations for tonight's reopening of the northern route, and the trucks are about to leave." Mr. Potter, the manager of the Burma Road, recently told a United Press reporter that he was very pleased to see the Burma Road reopen and military supplies transported to China. Potter praised the methods China had taken to prepare for the reopening of the road in the three months since it was closed, and said that even when it was known that the road would reopen, China's efforts did not stop. China will not hold a celebration for the reopening of the road. At this time of the road's reopening, China's expression is only of arduous work. The local authorities have paid attention to detecting Japanese spies who are trying to get the Japanese air base in Vietnam to know the time when the trucks enter China. On October 11, a member of the Japanese consulate arrived here from Yangon, but suddenly left the next day. The consulate member came to see the reopening of the road, but the police officers here immediately advised him, saying that the Burmese authorities could hardly guarantee their safety. The police authorities told the Japanese that there were no fewer than a thousand patriotic Chinese living in Lashio, so the Japanese returned to Yangon the next day. Among the goods to be transported to China starting tonight, there are also a large number of Japanese goods. These goods were left here together with British and American goods after the road was closed a month ago. According to well-informed sources, since the Japanese navy tightened its blockade of the Chinese coast, Japanese merchants often transported large quantities of their goods to free China via Burma. Most of the Japanese goods transported to China via Burma are decorated with Chinese trademarks, so that the Chinese believe they are buying domestic products. The first batch of goods to be loaded tonight may be test goods, and other goods will not be transported until after the Japanese aircraft bomb the Chinese section of the road. It is said that among these test goods, there will be some Japanese textiles, and it is believed that British and American arms and aircraft will be transported later this week. An inspection of the road shows that neither China nor Britain neglected this road during the three-month closure. During these three months, goods transported to China continued to enter Burma, and now they are concentrated at the border, ready for rapid transport. At 2:00 PM today, British customs officials began inspecting the first batch of goods to be transported to China, so that the batch of goods could be transported out by midnight.

<p>Editorial</p>
<p>— A Look at the Reopening of the Burma Road</p>
<p>"Like a white colt glimpsed through a crack, it passes in a flash." All too often, there is only a despondent sigh, which is all too often rather pointless. But when Britain succumbed to Japan, blocking the transport of military supplies on the Burma Road for a period of three months, it has finally come to an end today. Recalling the scene at the beginning: the Japanese side was arrogant, as if holding a person by the throat, with victory in hand; the British government endured humiliation, and members of Parliament rebuked the diplomatic authorities in Parliament as "shameful, truly shameful!" France smiled bitterly, using this as an excuse for continued concessions and compromises to violence in the future; Germany and Italy sneered from the sidelines, and world opinion was in uproar, mostly believing that it would lead to unfortunate consequences. All of these things are still fresh in our minds, but now the Burma Road seems to be governed by an irresistible natural law and has finally resumed its function. From today onwards, we will see large quantities of military supplies winding through thousands of mountains, continuously entering China. This will surely please the people of both China and Britain, as well as the international friendship between the two countries. But there must be those who lament the passage of time. Victory depends on time; time is on China's side, belonging to China!</p>
<p>After the Burma Road regains its vitality, the total amount of military supplies transported into China each day will be from 300 to 500 tons. Three to five hundred tons is not a small number. Over time, it will be even more impressive. But in large-scale modern warfare, this number is not a particularly large number, and China's resistance war does not rely on it as the sole source. The reason why we and even the general public pay such close attention to the opening and closing of this road, and even some people in the United States a few weeks ago inferred that the reopening of this road might lead to the outbreak of war in the Pacific in the past two days, is not simply because of the daily transport volume of 300 to 500 tons of military supplies. There is another meaning that deserves extreme attention. To state the most obvious meaning: First, having a road that is not open is abnormal, cowardly, shameful, and a paradoxical and erroneous act of suppressing the weak and flattering the strong. It is a trend of civilization and morality being reversed, and a sign of violence raising its eyebrows and justice perishing. Therefore, it is not necessary to consider the size of the throughput. What is valuable is that it is open, and now it is reopened. Moreover, 300 to 500 tons per day is not a small number in itself. Second, at the beginning of the Burma Road's closure, and even recently, the British side did not deny to Japan that it hoped to promote a reconciliation of the Sino-Japanese War within these three months of closure. Reconciliation values equality and parity. If a one-sided blockade is used to promote reconciliation, it is known that the goal sought is to unilaterally give the other side the opportunity to force the other party to submit. China has its self-confidence, so it has never made ruthless criticisms of Britain because of this from the beginning. Now that it has passed like a solar eclipse, there is no need to say more. However, the agreement was concluded under the pursuit of the past, and now it is dissolved under the current situation. This one opening and one closing accurately shows that China's war of resistance has spanned three or four years, experienced countless hardships, and remains unyielding. It also shows that the conspiracy to force China to submit has ultimately failed, all under the watchful eyes of the world, with a clear and powerful explanation of positive and negative. Third, when Britain succumbed to Japan and closed the Burma Road, laughing and scolding were from others, and it was forced to do so. It was not its original wish. It was nothing more than being frightened by Germany's continued victories in Europe and the precarious state of the British Isles. Although the British authorities spoke loudly and did not show weakness, it can be seen from their subservience to Japan that they were timid and discouraged, and they were worried that they would not be able to protect themselves. Therefore, they were afraid and dared not firmly reject Japan's demands, and could not resist Japan's intimidation and coercion. Now, Germany's offensive and Japan's intimidation and coercion not only still exist, but are also intensifying. Britain not only did not accept further demands, but also did not continue to make other concessions. They resolutely decided to abolish the humiliating agreement at the end of its term. It can be seen that Britain has been able to regain its self-confidence in the future of the war and the fate of the empire. The conflict between Britain and Germany, involving victory, defeat, survival, and death, was originally something that outsiders did not need to be very concerned about. However, since the establishment of the Tripartite Pact, it has no longer been possible to ignore the changes between them. Therefore, the confidence of the British side reflected by the opening of the Burma Road should be seen as containing an unusual meaning. Fourth, the factors for Britain's regained confidence are certainly not limited to one. However, the United States' national policy has become stronger and clearer, evolving from understatement to action, from sympathy and tacit understanding with Britain to open and unlimited assistance, and from principled support to concrete responses to each individual problem and individual purpose. For example, Secretary of State Hull declared that the United States would take responsibility for the impact of the Burma Road's reopening. This is the dawn of an ambiguous world, a great event concerning the overall situation! Fifth, the empty threats and coercive postures have been tested by the reopening of the Burma Road and have become a relic of international tactics. Eliminating this type of tactic can largely bring clarity to the international aspect. In the future, the only things that can become problems must be actual new actions with actual power. Although the disillusionment of threats and coercion does not limit the beginning of new actions, new actions must carefully consider their inevitable reactions and consequences due to the ineffectiveness of threats and coercion. Therefore, after the reopening of the Burma Road, we can imagine that tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, as well as the near future, may instead see superficial calm, that is, temporarily not hearing any childish boasting. It is also conceivable that all parties are engaged in arrangements and brewing for a decisive evolution, until some kind of sudden change breaks out.</p>
<p>From these five points, the reopening of the Burma Road is valued by the world. In addition to the five points, we still believe that there are other meanings, but there is no need to discuss them in detail today. What can be silently observed is that Konoe, the apparent new leader of Japan, and his subordinate Matsuoka, after exhausting their efforts and shouting at the top of their lungs to obstruct the reopening of the Burma Road and ultimately failing, what will they do besides trying ineffective bombings that cannot cut off traffic? How will they maintain their prestige and credibility that have not yet been firmly established?</p>
<h3>Hull to Deliver Speech; U.S. to Strengthen Far East Policy; Actively Negotiating with Australia; Canada Bans Tin Exports to Japan</h3>
<p>Washington: The State Department announced that Secretary of State Hull will deliver a speech on foreign policy on October 25. (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Washington: Senior government officials here continue to closely monitor the situation in the Far East, and the United States is stepping up negotiations to strengthen its tough policy in the Far East. President Roosevelt met with Australian Minister to Washington Casey, and it is believed that they reviewed the entire situation in the Far East. It is said that the issue of closer cooperation between the United States and Australia in the Pacific was the main point of discussion. Casey subsequently declined to comment on whether he had discussed the U.S. Navy's borrowing of the Singapore naval base with President Roosevelt. Casey told reporters, "It is best not to make special mention of such matters at this time." Later, the Australian Minister had a lengthy meeting with Secretary of State Hull, and it is believed that they continued negotiations that began several months ago, when Britain suggested that the United States borrow the Singapore naval base and other naval and air bases in the Pacific. The impression among well-informed circles here is that after most American expatriates have withdrawn from the Far East, the current British, American, and Australian talks can be clarified.

<p>Washington: The current Canadian Governor General, Earl Athlone, is about to visit President Roosevelt. This trip is of an informal nature and is different from the formal visit of former Canadian Governor General Tweedsmuir in 1937. Although Athlone's trip has no political significance, officials here say that it is another example of the close friendship between Canada and the United States. (Reuters dispatch of the 16th)</p>
<p>U.S. Navy Advocates Borrowing Singapore to Effectively Deal with Far East Crisis</p>
<p>Washington: Senior naval officers declared last night that if the United States does not borrow the Singapore naval base, the U.S. fleet will experience difficulties in the event of an incident. It is said that from a diplomatic standpoint, there may be considerable obstacles to establishing this agreement with Britain, but considering it from a purely naval standpoint, this move is necessary, because if the Singapore naval base is not borrowed, the U.S. Navy will inevitably encounter various serious difficulties in operating in the Far East. However, once this base is adopted, the U.S. Navy can immediately and effectively deal with the crisis in the Far East and prevent the enemy from approaching the China Sea from the southwest. Naval experts here point out that Singapore controls all the major oil sources in Malaya, so the fleet stationed in Singapore will not have any fuel problems. It is said that the Singapore naval base is large enough to accommodate the entire U.S. fleet, as it is larger than Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. As for food, it is shipped from Australia to Singapore, and arms and other supplies can be shipped from the United States to Singapore via the Cape of Good Hope, which is easier than via the Pacific.

<p>New York: Former Secretary of the Navy Johnson delivered a broadcast speech today, saying, "We are not prepared to act. In terms of complete military preparations, our achievements in two years can exceed Germany's construction in seven years. Only if Britain and its navy fall into enemy hands will we encounter an extremely dangerous situation." He also said that American aircraft are the best in the world, and currently 950 fully equipped aircraft can be produced each month. From January next year, this will reach 1,250 per month. "America's attempt to withdraw from the battlefield is more dedicated than any other country, but the result will be the destruction of American people and property in the Far East. The Germans are trying to interfere with the peace of the United States and its sister countries in the Americas." (Reuters dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<p>Several Prominent Professors Propose Absolute Embargo on Japan</p>
<p>Washington: Authoritative circles declared last night that the public's pressure on the government has gradually increased in recent weeks, so that the United States adopts a strict policy in the Far East. Recently established non-governmental organizations have repeatedly requested the government to "intensify and continue the pressure on Japan." At the same time, American newspapers have almost unanimously supported the government's tough attitude towards Japan. Recently established groups advocating strengthening Far East policy include several prominent university law professors. Led by Harvard University professor Warren Seavey, several university professors sent a letter to prestigious Americans yesterday, proposing a "three-principle program" to be adopted in the East. The three points are as follows: (1) Implement an absolute embargo on the export of electricity and important raw materials to Japan, and absolutely prohibit the import of Japanese goods. (2) Do everything possible to assist China, including unlimited credit loans and large quantities of arms and aircraft. (3) Establish an agreement with Britain to borrow the Singapore naval base and immediately send the U.S. fleet to Singapore. The university professor group announced its support for Far East policy several weeks ago, but only issued this letter yesterday. It is understood that the recipients are all prestigious members of society, most of whom are leaders in the business and education fields. The letter said, "American public opinion has changed, and America has awakened. Our country is now willing to take strong action. We are no longer burying our heads in the sand. Chamberlain's hesitation led to tragedy for Britain. We should not allow such people to mislead the United States again." (United Press dispatch of the 17th)</p>
<h3>Millions of American Youths Register for Draft, Supporting President Roosevelt's Declaration, Ready to Enlist for Military Training</h3>
<p>Washington - Millions of American youths yesterday registered for the draft, preparing to enlist and receive unprecedented military training in American history. Youths across the nation, regardless of race or class, uniformly responded to President Roosevelt's declaration that "Democratic government is created by you – it is the accomplishment of the youth." Sixteen million men between the ages of 21 and 35 flocked to thousands of registration officials to obtain registration certificates. After the Senate passed the conscription process, Sir Dykstra, President of the University of Wisconsin, was appointed as the Chief Registrar. After the President announced "Registration Day" on the radio at 8:00 AM, each registration office was immediately crowded with thousands of American youths seeking registration certificates. It is understood that one out of every forty registrants will be drafted to concentrate on training before the end of 1940. In New York City, 100,000 youths have registered. In Chicago, around 500,000 have registered. Philadelphia and Los Angeles have each registered around 250,000. A few Hollywood movie stars who are not yet of legal age also joined other adult men in requesting registration. Famous actors such as Clark Gable, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, Ronald Colman, and Cary Grant are over the legal age and were unable to go. Unmarried actors like James Stewart and Cesar Romero have a high chance of becoming soldiers. Most of the famous actors who have already registered are married, so they have little chance of being drafted. Famous actors who have formally registered include Robert Taylor, Lew Ayres, Tony Martin, and Robert Young. Crosby, Don Ameche, Henry Fonda, and Tyrone Power also registered. Many nightclub singers and waiters registered. They went immediately after closing at 4:00 AM, waiting until 7:00 AM. In addition, millions of workers participated in registration before going to work. As a result, crowds lined up in the streets, which were extremely crowded. (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Turkey Seeks to Enhance Cooperation with the Soviet Union; Soviet Union Denies Concentrating Troops on the Romanian Border</h3>
<p>Budapest - Balkan diplomatic circles claim that Turkey is now striving to establish closer cooperation with the Soviet Union. It is generally believed that Turkey may be placed under the Soviet Union's protection, like Outer Mongolia. This action may be possible as the Russian Black Sea Fleet is heading towards the abundant Batumi oil fields on the Russian coast, where the warships will be close to Turkey. The large-scale concentration of Red Army troops in Bessarabia and northern Bukovina, near the Romanian border, has brought the garrison forces at the border to ten divisions. Political observers here, therefore, predict that Germany and Russia will "show their cards" in the Balkans sooner than expected. (International dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Bucharest - Officials of the Soviet High Delegation asked here last night denied the reports that the Soviet Union had concentrated twelve Soviet divisions on the Soviet-Romanian border due to the German army's southward invasion of the Balkans. The official stated that the report that the Soviet Union had concentrated a very large army along the Romanian border was unfounded, and that they had indeed stationed a regular number of border defense troops along the Romanian border, but had not concentrated Soviet troops at any location on the Soviet-Romanian border. According to another report, some Soviet troops had built defensive fortifications along the Soviet-Romanian border. (United Press dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>Bucharest - Romanian newspapers advised Turkey to change its attitude, believing that a change in diplomatic strategy would be beneficial to Turkey. After the public signing of the German, Italian, and Japanese pact, the European war has entered a new stage. It is crucial for Turkey to decide its attitude, but it is surprising that Turkey is still hesitant when Britain and France are in dire straits. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Istanbul - Authoritative sources in Ankara claim that the rumors that the Soviet Union and Turkey are currently negotiating a mutual assistance treaty are unfounded. On Wednesday, the British Ambassador arrived in Ankara and met with Turkish Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu. According to political circles, this meeting was a routine exchange of opinions. The British Ambassador is now returning here. It is generally believed that the Turkish government does not view the overall situation as critically as initially perceived.

<h3>The Shadow of War Looms: German Planes Bomb English Countryside; Fierce Dogfights Between British and German Aircraft Over London; Britain to Employ Secret Anti-Aircraft Weapon</h3>
<p>London – Thick clouds, misty rain, visibility reduced to a hundred yards, making it difficult to see clearly. This weather, coupled with the agile work of anti-aircraft guns, has allowed Londoners to avoid Nazi atrocities and enjoy their first peaceful sleep in recent weeks. Although the sound of aircraft soaring overhead can still be heard from time to time, only a few bombs have fallen, mostly outside the city of London. However, last night, German aircraft once again scattered leaflets over the city. This was the first time in six weeks, since the start of the intense air raids, that this has occurred. A certain county in the east has obtained these leaflets. They appear to have been attached to balloons or parachutes and dropped. However, the content of these leaflets is not yet known. It is reported that three German planes were shot down over Britain last night. According to reports this morning, although some areas of London were bombed, the majority of the air raids were focused on inland counties, with countless rural areas being bombed. Two hospitals in southeastern England were hit. The London area was generally quiet until the all-clear sounded at 6:30 AM. Although some houses in London and other places were destroyed, the Air Ministry stated that last night's air raid resulted in the least damage and fewest casualties of any night raid. London newspapers this morning generally stated that the German night raiders had restrained their arrogance, as few German aircraft were seen below the clouds last night. Therefore, the bombs that fell must have been dropped completely at random. However, the raiders occasionally swooped down from the clouds. The anti-aircraft artillery suddenly intensified their firing after hearing the sound of German planes flying from afar, from low to high. Upon seeing the heavy anti-aircraft fire, the German planes immediately retreated above the clouds. The night raids in other provinces were also not very serious, but a German plane in a village in the southwest flew low and fired a machine gun, and then dropped high-explosive and incendiary bombs in another village, injuring two people. A nursery and a cottage were severely damaged. Two hospitals in a town in southeastern England were hit, one of which killed several nurses and injured several nurses and patients. German planes were also shot down in Stockport, Harwich, and other places. It is generally expected that Britain's night air defense plan, as well as other factors, will make it very difficult for German planes to raid Britain. Britain's air defense plan is very secret, but reliable sources said this morning that the new plan to resist German planes has been completed. The Daily Telegraph's air raid reporter said, "Once this plan is adopted, Hitler will see that our secret weapon is more terrifying than anything he can implement. Once this weapon is used, it will greatly surprise the Germans." (United Press dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London – German planes attacked London all night, dropping high-explosive bombs, incendiary bombs, and time bombs over London. The air raid ended at 6:00 AM this morning. The number of deaths and the extent of the damage were unprecedented. This was the 222nd air raid on London since the start of the war. British anti-aircraft fire was intensified in the air, forcing German planes to stay at high altitude and drop bombs randomly. The German planes concentrated their attack on the outskirts of London. In the fortieth consecutive night raid, four German planes were shot down by the British. Almost all of Britain suffered severe air raids this time. A certain southeastern city was subjected to terrible bombing for several hours. A certain city in the Midlands was also hit hard. Some areas of Wales were also severely hit. Liverpool, a city that is frequently raided, was no exception this time. A large air-raid shelter in the city was hit by a German bomb, and it is said that there were many deaths and injuries. In a city in southwestern England, a German bomber flew straight down and strafed crowded streets with machine guns, while also dropping many high-explosive and incendiary bombs. Although the Germans have recently bombed London all night, they have so far failed to inflict any major damage on London. (International Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin – This morning, German bomber squadrons attacked various districts in central England and the western coast south of Liverpool. A large airfield was bombed, destroying three hangars and a boiler room. Other buildings were also hit and caught fire. Several English planes parked on the airfield were severely damaged. A German Junkers 88 attacked a British military transport train and hit the locomotive, causing it to explode immediately. Six carriages were derailed and the rest were destroyed. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin – According to inquiries by this agency, the areas of London bombed on Wednesday night are still burning. There are still five major fires in the large warehouses north of Victoria Dock. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>London – Today, there was very little enemy aircraft activity in the daytime. The night gradually became more intense. London was covered with low-lying clouds tonight. German bombers came and indiscriminately dropped bombs above the clouds, causing significant damage to residential areas. The first German bomber shot down tonight was shot down by anti-aircraft fire in Hertfordshire. It caught fire and burned fiercely, lasting for an hour before it was extinguished. All crew members perished in the flames. It is heard that two more German planes were shot down after that. One crashed in North Wales, and the other was damaged by anti-aircraft fire and crashed into a house in a southeastern town. Several enemy planes flew low from the southeast towards London late at night, and were subjected to particularly intense anti-aircraft fire. They hurriedly dropped high-explosive bombs and fled back to the coast. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>London – Britain was severely attacked last night, and today's daytime was quite peaceful. It is reported that only a certain coastal town in Scotland and a place in the west had bombs dropped. King George of England drove through the bombed areas of London this afternoon and inspected the headquarters of the London Fire Brigade, listening to the Fire Brigade's report on fighting fires during air raids. He also stayed in the command room for half an hour, examining a large map of London, which marked the locations where fires had started and been extinguished. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin – A German reconnaissance plane flew to London yesterday morning to inspect the results of the previous night's battle. It saw thirty or forty locations where major fires had recently occurred. Houses and factories were still burning, with flames reaching as high as four hundred meters. London was like a volcano. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin – This morning, German bombers set out for England again. The first batch of German planes arrived over London at 9:50 AM. Before long, English planes took off to engage them. As a result of the fierce battle, both sides lost two planes each. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Naval and Air Forces Jointly Attack Cherbourg: Heavy German Casualties; Invasion Plans Likely to be Delayed; Three German Supply Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>London – The London Daily Express's Madrid correspondent reported today that in the recent British naval and air attacks on Cherbourg, the German death toll was between 40,000 and 50,000. The correspondent stated that exhausted and defeated German troops have left the coastal area, and their invasion plan appears to have been at least temporarily abandoned. It is said that at least 500,000 German troops have been stationed in the key ports of the French Channel, awaiting the order to invade England for more than a month. This force is fully armed, and thousands of barges are ready to carry them across the sea to Britain. However, the naval guns and long-range artillery in the English Channel, as well as the frequent visits by British bombers, have further delayed the invasion date. A London Daily Express reporter stated that the result of the British naval and air attacks on Cherbourg last week was that the German side suffered heavy losses, and the number of dead and injured was also huge. The army has now been sent to southern France for rest and replenishment. Bayonne and Biarritz have been turned into large-scale German convalescent centers for the wounded. (International News, 17th)</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry has continued to release details of the British bomber attacks on military targets and transportation within Germany on Tuesday and Wednesday nights. From this, it can be seen that the scope of the offensive taken by the British Air Force against Germany is increasing. Kiel was continuously attacked for several hours, with many tons of bombs dropped. Torpedo boat docks and nautical colleges in the harbor were hit. Major wharves, southeast of the shipyard and the Germania shipyard, were repeatedly hit by huge bombs. Another batch of bombs apparently hit oil storage tanks, causing a huge fire. Other targets bombed by the British Air Force included the Magdburg, Salzburg, and Gelsenkirch oil refineries and storage facilities, the Hamburg docks, and Cologne, Düsseldorf, and other places. A supply train near Rouen was hit by a bomb. In addition, more than 20 locations in the heart of Germany, airfields in Germany and the Netherlands, and docks and ships in the Netherlands, Belgium, and France were heavily bombed. Antwerp was attacked on Wednesday morning, with warehouses and railway lines hit and destroyed in Zeebrugge. Docks in the ports of Calais and Boulogne were also bombed by British naval aircraft. On Tuesday, British bombers, while evading German planes attempting to intercept them, bombed key targets such as sluice gates and oil ponds in Flushing. Another batch of Blenheim bombers attacked two power stations in Lorient. In addition, naval aviation and coastal command aircraft jointly attacked Brest, dropping huge bombs on port facilities and ships. Hudson aircraft were also active in the Netherlands, bombing the inner harbor of Wilhelmshaven and enemy destroyers off Texel. According to reports from the pilots who carried out the attacks, the bombings mentioned above caused heavy damage to enemy port facilities and major ship gathering locations. (Reuters, 17th)</p>

An airfield south of Liverpool was attacked, and an ordnance factory in the center was bombed and caught fire. In the evening, more and more German planes bombed London. From night to morning, military facilities on both sides of the Thames River were rained down with bombs. Military targets in Birmingham and Liverpool were also subjected to heavy bombardment. Enemy warships attempted to enter the English Channel but were blocked by German coastal artillery fire. A German submarine sank three armed merchant ships (21,000 tons) and one oil tanker (10,000 tons). Last night, English planes attacked residential areas in Germany, with no damage to military facilities. One plane attempting to fly into Germany was shot down, another was destroyed in aerial combat, and yet another was shot down by naval anti-aircraft guns. Two German planes did not return to their original base. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>

<h3>London Citizens Live in Stability; Traffic Maintains Normalcy</h3>
<p>London - A Reuters correspondent reports: I inspected both banks of the River Thames in London for two hours yesterday and saw that industrial and private life are as stable as before. The German bombers that attacked London on Tuesday night continued to cause minor damage to this great city and its suburbs. Berlin's claim that London experienced "unprecedented chaos" and that "all kinds of businesses were temporarily suspended" is nothing but self-congratulatory fabrication. London's streetcars and trains run uninterrupted, and citizens work as usual. I rented a car at a place where streetcars were shuttling back and forth, and waited for a quarter of an hour because of the traffic congestion before my car could start. In a corner of central London, the cars for business trips, buses, trams, and trucks are bumper to bumper, and the congestion is no less than before the war. The reporter couldn't wait and ordered the driver to take a detour to the first station on the main railway line. Upon arriving, I saw that the trains were running smoothly as usual, and the group of citizens, many of whom were women and children, abandoned their newly bombed houses and boarded the train to go elsewhere. A railway employee said that the number of passengers was no more than usual. According to the station staff on the night shift, the trains ran smoothly yesterday morning. In the places the reporter passed, there were occasional walls collapsing and roads cracking, which was an indication that bombs had fallen nearby. Workers were busy clearing rubble. A certain area was on fire and had already been watered, and the water hoses were still scattered on the ground. Smoke billowed from the chimneys of one of London's most important power plants, and the workers were just finishing their work. The reporter stopped at a roadside cafe to have breakfast. Milk and bread were delivered on time, but the meat delivery man was half an hour late, and the owner complained annoyingly. Outside the cafe, women carrying baskets were shopping in an endless stream. The dock area was still lively. Shops and banks in the city center were open as usual. The reporter saw the scars of new and old bombs in more than a dozen areas of London, but the citizens now regard the air raids as commonplace and proceed with their work as usual. This is what moved the reporter the most. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>German Pilots Achieve Remarkable Victories</h3>
<p>Berlin – German Air Force Major Mölders has shot down 47 enemy planes since the outbreak of the war in Europe. He shot down 14 planes during the Spanish Civil War.

<h3>German Diplomacy Strictly Maintains Secrecy</h3>
<p>Berlin – According to the "Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger", the attacks by Germany and Italy are not limited to London, but also pay attention to other parts of Britain. Berlin has not announced where the Axis powers will attack in the near future. According to well-informed sources, when the time is ripe, Britain will understand what kind of decisions the Axis powers have made. German officials declined to comment on reports by foreign journalists that the Axis powers are actively engaged in diplomatic activities and that they attach great importance to Southeast Europe, as this issue involves diplomatic secrets and is extremely difficult to answer. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement in Palestine</h3>
<p>Hejing – According to news from Beirut, Palestinian Arabs held anti-British and anti-Jewish demonstrations yesterday and the day before. This was caused by the insult to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. It was found that on the tenth day of this month, some Jews threw stones at the Grand Mufti, and the British police nearby turned a blind eye and did not intervene. The Grand Mufti openly criticized Britain that evening, which aroused public outrage among the Arabs. There was also chaos in the Haifa Jewish Institute of Technology, caused by a Jewish student illegally carrying a handgun. The British authorities dispatched troops and tanks to suppress the riots, resulting in clashes and casualties on both sides. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<h3>Western Indian Princely States Raise Aircraft Fund</h3>

<h3>Three Thousand American Women and Children from the Far East to Be Evacuated; Americans from Various Places Head to Shanghai to Secure Ship Berths; Men Seem Likely to Remain Temporarily Awaiting Developments; U.S. Flagship Carrying Naval Dependents Departs Today</h3>
<p>More than 3,300 applications from American citizens in this city preparing to evacuate and reserving passage on U.S. President Lines ships have been received to date. Over 1,100 of these applications were filed by American citizens in this city, while the rest came from other cities in China and Japan, etc. According to a statement issued by a senior official of the shipping company, almost all those reserving passage are women and children, with very few men. This proves that all the children and most of the women among the American citizens in this city will be evacuated from Shanghai first, but the men are still waiting to see how things develop. Furthermore, according to a reporter from the English-language *China Press* who learned yesterday morning that the U.S. Consul General's Office in this city had issued a notice advising American citizens to evacuate and had received 2,500 responses, it is expected that more than 3,000 replies will be received. It is reported that the Chinese Consulate here will likely continue to issue notices within this week, informing American citizens who have not registered with the consulate to quickly prepare to evacuate.</p>
<p>Registered American Citizens: 2,500</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports that after the U.S. Consulate issued the notice for American citizens in Shanghai to evacuate, it has received approximately 2,500 responses as of this (17th) morning. The U.S. Consulate is still awaiting the remaining responses, as more than 3,000 notices were sent to American citizens within the Shanghai Consulate district. It is also heard that the U.S. Consulate is expected to continue sending this notice to American citizens who have not registered with the consulate within this week.</p>
<p>Unanimous Hope for Reduced Travel Expenses</p>
<p>At the same time, American citizens in this city unanimously believe that shipping companies should reduce the cost of repatriation for American citizens being evacuated. They say that since the U.S. government recognizes the evacuation of American citizens in Shanghai as extremely important and is sending additional ships to the Far East, the shipping companies should understand the situation and reduce the fares for evacuating American citizens.</p>
<p>Over Three Thousand Reservations</p>
<p>Yesterday, officials at the shipping company told reporters that although payment has not yet been made for the 3,300-plus applications for ship tickets, it is believed that these are genuine reservations. Even if some are cancelled due to uncertainty, these will undoubtedly be few in number. Once the passenger ships sent to Shanghai to evacuate the overseas Chinese are about to arrive, all those who have applied to reserve tickets will be required to pay in cash first in order to make the reservation valid. This will happen within a week or two. At that time, the so-called precautionary measures will become a reality.</p>
<p>Only Three U.S. Ships to Evacuate Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>The U.S. government has slightly adjusted the schedule of four giant ships to transport evacuating overseas Chinese from the Far East. The first ship, the *Monterey* of Matson Lines, has already set sail eastward and is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month. The second ship has not yet been reported to have set sail. According to U.S. shipping circles, the *Manhattan* may not be coming for the time being. Currently, it is confirmed that only the *Washington*, *Monterey*, and *Mariposa* will be coming. If necessary, the *Manhattan* will be dispatched. The ship berths reserved by American citizens in this city with U.S. President Lines have not been designated to any specific ship.</p>
<p>The *Augusta* Departs Today</p>
<p>Regarding the actions of the U.S. Navy, reporters have obtained all information from Western sources, but because the U.S. is strictly maintaining secrecy, it is often impossible to verify the information. For example, the large transport ships *Altair* and *Chaumont* were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Manila yesterday, but as of yesterday, it was said that the *Altair* would have to be delayed until around the 20th, while the *Chaumont* would not arrive until around the 10th of next month. Regarding the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, the *Augusta*, there was also talk yesterday morning that its departure from Shanghai would be delayed, but reliable sources reported last night that the *Augusta* suddenly received urgent orders yesterday afternoon and decided to depart as scheduled today. It is said that all the families of senior U.S. Navy officers planning to leave Shanghai on the ship, as well as reservists in Shanghai who have been summoned to depart, boarded the ship last night and will go to Manila today. The uncertainty of U.S. naval vessel movements is indicative of the general seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>Shanghai American School to Continue Classes as Usual</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to reliable sources, although a large number of American women and children in this city are preparing to return home, the Shanghai American School will not suspend classes. Since the U.S. State Department issued the notice advising American citizens to evacuate, only ten students have withdrawn from the school. School officials have stated that the future of the school still depends on the decision of all American citizens. The American citizens who have applied to the U.S. Consul General's Office to prepare for evacuation may not all leave Shanghai at that time, as applying and actually doing it are two different things. Therefore, school officials do not intend to make any definite plans until the appropriate time.</p>
<h3>The Burma Road Reopens Today; Preparations for Freight Transportation are Busy; Shipping Companies Consider Opening Regular Shipping Routes; Daily Necessities to Be Shipped to Singapore First</h3>
<p>The Burma Road has been reopened today. The Shanghai branch of British shipping company is considering opening a regular shipping route between Shanghai and Singapore or Rangoon. The transportation industry has dispatched a specialist to Rangoon to inspect. Regarding waterway shipping costs, negotiations have been held with various shipping companies to reduce them. Regarding land transportation, contact has been made with the National Government to dispatch trucks for transportation. It is reported that some daily necessities will be allowed to be shipped from Shanghai to Singapore, then transferred to Rangoon, and then enter Sichuan via the Burma Road. The Postal Administration has decided to find ways to import parcels to the southwest and northwest via the Burma Road.</p>
<p>Sino-American Trade Sees Light Again</p>
<p>Since China implemented a full-scale war of resistance against Japan, in addition to domestic production, its military supplies have mainly come from the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. Before the fall of Guangzhou, the import of British and American materials was through Kowloon. After the fall of Guangzhou, imports were rerouted through land routes in the southwest. Since French Indochina succumbed to Japan, and Britain adopted a policy of appeasement in the Far East, the routes through Vietnam and Burma were closed one after another. China's external communication relied solely on the Sino-Soviet Highway. The import of Soviet goods was not a problem, but the transportation of American goods to China was quite difficult. Lighter goods could still be transported via Vladivostok, through Kulun and Ningxia to Lanzhou, but heavy goods were difficult to transport. The export of tungsten sand and tung oil to the United States was affected. These two types of goods are unique products of China, which are not only related to the repayment of American debt, but also needed by the U.S. national defense industry. Therefore, the closing of the routes through Vietnam and Burma was opposed by Washington. With the signing of the alliance between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the United States firmly supported Britain in opening the Burma Road in order to safeguard the common interests of both China and the United States. It is expected that American materials will be continuously imported, and Chinese raw materials will also be continuously transported to the United States, promoting trade and benefiting both sides.</p>
<p>Transportation Routes as Dense as Spider Webs</p>
<p>With the preparations of both China and Britain, transportation on the Burma Road is very convenient. There is a railway connecting Rangoon to Lashio and then to Kunming. The highway between Rangoon and Lashio runs parallel to the railway, and there are rivers that can通 to Bhamo. There is a highway from Bhamo to Kunming. There are 6,000 trucks available in China, and countless mules, horses, boats, coolies, and porters. The transportation capacity is quite sufficient.</p>
<h3>Another Arrest in the Attempted Assassination of Fu Xiaoan; Also Worked in Fu's Residence; Has Been Detained by the Japanese</h3>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports that, according to reliable sources, in connection with the assassination of Fu Xiaoan, the "Municipal Police" arrested another suspect yesterday (16th) afternoon, who is believed to be the mastermind behind the assassination. The "Municipal Police" did not acknowledge the arrest, but did not disclose the name. It was only learned that the person also worked in Fu's residence. After the suspect was arrested, he was handed over to the Japanese Army Special Service Department for interrogation. Currently, two people have been detained by the Japanese authorities in connection with the assassination attempt on Fu: one is the person arrested yesterday, and the other is a cook surnamed Chen who was detained shortly after the incident.</p>
<h3>Bomb Case at North Railway Station; Japanese Say Attempt to Assassinate Liang Hongzhi</h3>
<p>At 10:10 AM the day before yesterday (16th), a grenade was suddenly discovered at ticket window number four of the North Railway Station. It did not explode at the time and was removed immediately after being discovered, so no incident occurred. It is now learned that the Japanese have paid close attention to the incident. In addition to strictly investigating the source of the bomb, it is also learned that the Japanese claimed that the first person to discover the two bombs was a Japanese guard, Taichi Mizumura, who reported it to the Japanese military police stationed there, who then devised a way to remove it. They also said that the bomb must have been intended by an assassin to assassinate Liang Hongzhi, the head of the "Supervisory Yuan," because Liang was returning to Nanjing on the 7:00 AM express train that day. At that time, the assassin must have been unable to act due to the strict security at the station, so he abandoned the bomb there.</p>
<h3>Chinese Guerrillas Active in the Yangtze River Basin; The Spirit of the Guerrillas is Further Enhanced Because the International Situation is Favorable to China</h3>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports that a foreign traveler recently returned to Shanghai from the Yangtze River basin and said that the guerrillas are becoming increasingly active in the Yangtze River basin. They heard that the Japanese are preoccupied in the south, and that Britain and the United States are now taking actions against Japan, which has further boosted their morale. The general public in the Yangtze River basin believes that the pressure from the guerrillas has made the Japanese even more difficult. The Japanese troops stationed in the Yangtze River basin are not numerous. The Japanese troops stationed in the Taihu Lake area are worried about the guerrillas west and north of Taihu Lake. The Japanese have implemented a strong economic monopoly throughout the Yangtze River basin. The people in the Yangtze River basin are living in dire conditions because the cost of living has risen to unprecedented levels.</p>
<h3>Siam's Bumper Harvest; No Restrictions on Shipments to Hong Kong; 250,000 Bags of Foreign Rice to Arrive in Port; But Concerns About Panic Are Not Alleviated</h3>
<p>According to a statement issued to the Hong Kong press by Mr. Soya, the Acting Consul of Thailand (Siam) in Hong Kong, he had not heard of any restrictions on the shipment of rice to Hong Kong. Siamese rice is abundant in foreign markets (i.e., foreign countries such as Japan, the Netherlands East Indies, British Malaya, and the Straits Settlements, the Philippines, China, etc.), but this year's harvest is bumper, and even after meeting domestic needs, supply still exceeds demand, so there is no need for government control. The sudden rise and fall of rice prices in Hong Kong is due to the war, and the slight increase in shipping costs and insurance, but it is difficult to know whether the cause of the rise lies in Hong Kong or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Profits on Foreign Rice</p>
<p>The Rice Price Evaluation Committee convened a plenary committee meeting the day before yesterday and resolved that the legal profit for buying and selling foreign rice in the market should be 5% added to the production price. The principle has been formally approved by the committee and it was resolved that instructions be requested from the authorities of the two concession areas for formal implementation. In order to actively proceed, the committee sent letters to the authorities of the two concession areas yesterday. Once the instructions from the two concession areas are received, a committee meeting will be scheduled to discuss the specific measures and implement them according to the established policy. It is reported that the two authorities have expressed their support for the principle and will approve it for implementation at that time, so the city's overall food situation may gradually stabilize.</p>
<p>Huge Shipment to Shanghai</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports that rice prices in this city are high, and the food situation is still quite serious. However, it was learned this (17th) morning that more than 250,000 bags of Saigon rice are expected to be shipped to Shanghai before October 28, which will improve the food situation. The above-mentioned Saigon rice will be shipped in four batches. The quantity is larger than previous shipments of rice to Shanghai. The first batch of 50,000 bags is scheduled to leave Vietnam on October 18. The subsequent batches will be shipped successively on October 22, October 26, and October 28, with 50,000 bags, 30,000 bags, and 40,000 bags each. It is also reported that the Shanghai Zengji Company (transliteration) ordered another 15,000 bags of Saigon rice on Tuesday, which is also expected to arrive soon. At the same time,</p>
<p>Key to High Rice Prices</p>
<p>Shanghai officials stated this morning that although Saigon rice is being shipped intermittently, the difficulties currently encountered in the Shanghai rice market will not be alleviated. To make the food situation more normal and lower rice prices, it is necessary to obtain more domestic rice from the areas around Shanghai. This depends on the Japanese authorities' willingness to cooperate. The concession authorities have repeatedly requested the Japanese authorities to provide assistance. It is also reported that almost all the rice produced in the occupied areas is handled by Mitsui Bussan Kaisha and shipped out of China in large quantities. Mitsui Bussan Kaisha had previously forcibly seized the egg export business, causing a large shortage of eggs in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Lack of Domestic Rice</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that, according to sources responsible yesterday (16th), domestic rice is constantly being smuggled into Shanghai, but the quantity is very small and insufficient to meet the huge demand of the Chinese residents in the concession areas. This is one of the main reasons why foreign rice remains expensive and does not tend to fall in price. It is said that the rice situation in this city has reached a serious level. Qualified observers say that importing foreign rice to feed the 3.5 million Chinese residents in the International Settlement cannot solve the food problem, as most of these residents can only afford to buy low-priced domestic rice. The concession authorities are currently urging the Japanese army to allow the domestic rice produced in its controlled areas to be shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream. According to Chinese officials, even if the military authorities allow domestic rice to be shipped in, the issue of rice supply and distribution will still require a longer period of consideration. At the same time, the demand for domestic rice in this city is becoming increasingly urgent. An official from the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Investigation Office stated that he has spoken with the liaison officer of the Japanese military authorities several times, and the Japanese military authorities have promised to give careful consideration to the matter of shipping in domestic rice.</p>
<h3>Mental Health Association to Hold Lecture Today</h3>

<h3>Labor and Management of French Tram Company to Hold Direct Negotiations; Company Manager Made Frank Statement Yesterday; No Success in Negotiations with Intermediaries</h3>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports that Mr. Favre, the manager of the French Tram Company, told reporters this (17th) morning that the company's labor strike has lasted for three weeks, and he is very dissatisfied with the lack of progress in negotiations with intermediaries. Therefore, the company will attempt to negotiate directly with the strikers today in order to end the dispute. The strikers may not have been informed of the details of the negotiations. At 3:00 PM this afternoon, Favre received reporters in his office and said that the French Tram Company is seeking the assistance of newspapers to convey the company's desire to negotiate directly with the 2,500 striking workers, so that they can accurately understand the employer's attitude. It is believed that most of the strikers are unaware that negotiations are taking place.</p>
<p>Strict Security Still Around Company</p>
<p>In order to prevent serious incidents from occurring, the French police have implemented strict security around the tram depot on Rue Lupan. The intersection in front of the tram depot on Rue Lupan and Route Conty has been locked with iron nets, leaving only an entrance, and four French and Chinese police officers and one armored car are stationed there. Pedestrians and vehicles are not allowed to enter or exit. Additional police officers have also been stationed at the intersection of the tram depot on Rue Siccawei to provide protection, and patrol teams are patrolling the nearby roads.</p>
<p>Employer's Attitude Not Harsh</p>
<p>According to another report, company officials stated that they hope to resolve the labor strike as soon as possible in a spirit of goodwill and cooperation. The company is willing to negotiate directly or indirectly with the workers, as long as a reasonable solution is reached. The company is willing to make some sacrifices. The authorities refuted rumors that the company's attitude is tough and that it is dealing harshly with the workers' demands as malicious propaganda and untrue.</p>
<p>Mr. Chapellain Denies Mediation</p>
<p>Mr. Chapellain, the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday stating that he read the following news in the local news section of your newspaper on the 17th of this month: "Mr. Chapellain, the Director of the Postal Department of the General Post Office and Director of the French Municipal Council, is serving as a mediator in the labor strike of the French Tram Company." Upon investigation, since I am not a Director of the French Municipal Council, I have not participated in mediating the labor strike of the French Tram Company. The above news is likely based on inaccurate rumors. Please investigate and correct it. Respectfully, The Editorial Department of *Shen Bao*, Chapellain, October 17.</p>
<h3>Shengjing Returns to Export After Inspection Finds Nothing; Passengers and Cargo Once Ashore</h3>
<p>The Shengjing, a North China liner of British Taikoo Company, loaded with cargo and passengers and sailed from Shanghai at 12:00 noon the day before yesterday (15). At 4:00 PM on the same day, the company received a secret report saying that there were bombs hidden in the cargo of the ship, and immediately telegraphed the ship to return. As reported in earlier newspapers, when the ship received the telegram, it had already left Sheshan waters. It was already 6:00 PM. The ship immediately turned around and returned to Shanghai, arriving at the port at 12:30 AM at night, and berthed at the company's No. 1 Wharf (i.e., the former New Peking Wharf) on the Bund of the French Concession. The Customs Port Police Station (i.e., the water police station) and fire boats had paid close attention beforehand. After the ship berthed, customs police immediately boarded the ship to search. Fire boats were parked nearby to stand by. The company prepared coolies to open the cargo hold and unload all the cargo ashore for temporary storage in warehouse No. 6. After the cargo was unloaded, the inspection found nothing. The original cargo was then reloaded onto the ship. The ship returned to export and sailed to Weihaiwei, Yantai, and Tianjin at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Passengers had once landed, but then boarded the ship again with their original tickets. The general passengers were surprised when the ship returned.</p>

<h3>Inhuman Parricide Case; Appeal to Third Instance</h3>
<p>The nationally sensational inhuman parricide case, in which brothers Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxian used cruel means, electrocuting their father Zhou Yongjie and dismembering his body in an attempt to destroy evidence, was exposed by their sister, Zhou Qinzhu. Their father's wife, Zhou Jing, was also suspected of aiding and abetting the crime and was arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. The two sons were sentenced to death and Zhou Jing was sentenced to two years and six months in prison. Unsatisfied, they appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, but the appeal was rejected. Zhou Qinji and Zhou Qinxian remained dissatisfied and had their defense lawyers Yang Encheng, Yang Linzhi, and Ye Shaoying file an appeal to the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court on their behalf. The appeal statement, which is over 10,000 words long, was submitted to the branch of the Supreme Court yesterday. The final outcome is currently unpredictable.</p>

<h3>Bomb Found Again in Sixth National Hotel Gambling Den; Fortunately, It Did Not Explode</h3>
<p>Huaguang News Agency reports that the Sixth National Hotel gambling den at No. 346, Haig Road, is an organization formed by merging the former Autumn Garden, Hollywood, and other six major gambling dens, hence the name "Sixth National." More than a thousand gamblers enter and leave every day, generating huge profits. Therefore, it is inevitable that it will be envied by others. A week ago, a bomb was thrown at it, injuring one gambler. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 PM the night before last, another bomb was discovered in the gambling den. The address was still next to the Pai Gow table downstairs in the new building. It was discovered by an inspector at the time, who then devised a way to remove it. Fortunately, it did not explode.</p>
<h3>Rong Feng Textile Company Sued for Damages; Fu Company Sues for 280,000 Yuan; Rong Feng Company Also Counter-Sues for Damages</h3>
<p>Zhang Rongchu's Rong Feng Textile Company has recently been sued by Fu Company of 34 Avenue Edward VII, represented by lawyer Jiang Baoli, in the First Special Court's civil division, due to a dispute over an order for Indian cotton. The lawsuit seeks damages of 280,000 national currency. The gist of the lawsuit is that the defendant, Rong Feng Textile Company, entered into contracts with the plaintiff from January to February of this year,委托ing the plaintiff to purchase several thousand bales of Indian cotton. Because the defendant failed to make timely payments, the exchange rate fluctuations were significant, causing the plaintiff a loss of 280,000 yuan. The plaintiff requests the court to order the defendant to bear this loss. After receiving the lawsuit, the court, presided over by Judge Li, held a hearing yesterday. The plaintiff, Fu Company, through its lawyer Jiang Baoli, presented the facts and reasons for the lawsuit in detail. The defendant, Rong Feng Textile Company, represented by its lawyer, argued that the loss claimed by the plaintiff was due to the plaintiff's fault. The plaintiff failed to ship the ordered cotton quickly, causing even greater losses to the defendant. In addition to requesting the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit, the defendant also filed a counter-suit seeking damages from the plaintiff, Fu Company, for an unspecified amount. The court noted that the case required further investigation and adjourned the hearing to the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Dr. Ding Hanren Explains Symptoms of "Dengue Fever"</h3>
<p>Reports in the newspaper recently indicated that the epidemic disease "dengue fever" is prevalent in Shanghai. Dr. Ding Hanren's description of this disease, also known as autumn epidemic, is quite detailed from a traditional Chinese medicine perspective. It is recorded below to help patients and doctors understand the true nature of this disease.</p>
<p>(1) Cause: A month ago, the autumn sun was still scorching hot, no less severe than midsummer, which marked the beginning of the autumn epidemic. Then came days of continuous wind and rain, with cold and dampness invading. Once contracted, the disease follows. Before the appearance of red rashes, both symptoms and blood tests may be mistaken for typhoid fever. The disease is autumn epidemic, often occurring with cold and dampness, thus resembling damp-heat epidemic and typhoid fever. However, its incubation period is very short, making it easier to contract and spread rapidly.</p>
<p>(2) Symptoms: Initially, chills and fever, headache, chest tightness, dry mouth, sore limbs, white and greasy tongue coating, red prickles on the tip of the tongue, and a soft and rapid pulse. After three or four days, red, itchy rashes appear on the face and limbs. The fever gradually subsides as the rashes appear, or the rashes appear as the fever weakens. The disease usually resolves in seven or eight days.</p>
<p>(3) Treatment: According to personal clinical statistics, over a hundred soldiers have been cured of this disease in the past month. Recently, with the widespread flooding, the spread of bacteria has intensified, and the number of patients has increased. However, the treatment process has been smooth. First, use a pungent-cooling and dispersing method to release the warm evil. This helps the red rashes to emerge easily. Then, use a heat-clearing and dampness-transforming method to eliminate residual heat. The body heat gradually subsides. If one can avoid wind-chill and control their diet, there is no need to worry about recurrence. Follow the treatment methods for exogenous warm-heat diseases of the ancient sage Ye Tianshi, and be cautious with bitter-warm and fragrant-drying medicines. This will leave no regrets.</p>
<h3>Silk Mercerizing Industry Labor Dispute Resolved; Labor-Management Agreement Signed</h3>

<h3>Case of Huge Copper Ingot Theft; Three Suspects to be Tried Together; German National Bender and White Le Suspected of Conspiracy; Two Warehouse Managers Arrested</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of Swiss national White Le stealing a large amount of copper ingots and copper coins from the warehouse of the American Ruifeng Transfer Company, at 0:20 on the night of September 26, Yang Peisheng, deputy chief of the Central Police Station, acting on a tip, arrested two suspects, Yong natives Zhuang Zixiang and Zhou Maofa (both warehouse managers of Ruifeng), within his jurisdiction. They were escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation and detained. At 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, the police station, based on the suspects' confessions, learned that White Le had stolen from the warehouse with the prior collusion of Wilhehm Bender (40 years old, resident of 7 Pike Street), the German general manager of the warehouse. They claimed that they only found out about the conspiracy when the theft was carried out. The police station then ordered Western officers to Bender's residence at the address, arrested him, and escorted him to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. A request was made for a postponement. Judge Fang presided over the hearing. The defendant's testimony was evasive, and he refused to provide a truthful account. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled the case to be heard together with Zhuang Zixiang and others on the 25th of this month.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Austrian Psychiatrist Professor Wagner-Jauregg (3) The Conqueror of General Paralysis of the Insane By Han Fen Translated by Xia Chu</h3>
<p>In 1911, Ehrlich invented the magic bullet, bringing new hope. However, it soon became clear that the spirochetes lurking within the blood vessels of the brain remained unaffected by the new treatment.</p>
<p>Wagner-Jauregg endured thirty years of failure and discouragement. Finally, on June 14, 1917, he resolutely injected the blood of malaria patients into two paralytic patients, using it as an artificial fever to replace bacteria. He once said, "The treasure left on the road in 1887 was finally picked up in 1917."</p>
<p>Other paralytic patients followed suit and received the same injections. Wagner-Jauregg's method allowed patients already in the deadly grip of madness to recover their health, regain their human dignity, and reintegrate into society as useful individuals. Many years later, the first two paralytic patients he treated remained healthy and able to support themselves. They were resurrected from the brink of death and gained a place in history. Everyone recognizes them as relics of the medical field.</p>
<p>The inventor and his school worked hard for several more years to establish the new treatment method. It also took many years to explore how to eliminate physiological dangers and how to control artificial infections. New difficulties arose: "How to cultivate malaria protozoa in places without malaria?" "If this treatment is adopted, what if malaria spreads?" Wagner-Jauregg knew that these would become the headlines accusing him of "killing in the name of science."</p>
<p>All these questions were eventually resolved, all fears and anxieties disappeared, skeptics were silenced, and tens of millions of paralytic patients worldwide benefited from Wagner's malaria therapy. For this, he received the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>However, his invention was not limited to treating general paralysis alone; its benevolent consequences extended even deeper. Wagner dreamed of preventing neurosyphilis, driving the spirochetes out of the nervous system in the early stages of syphilis, several years before the terrible general paralysis developed. This dream also came true. When used appropriately and guided properly, malaria therapy also became a preventive method.</p>
<p>In this way, Wagner not only gave psychiatrists a weapon, but every physician benefited from it. Their enemy—the spirochete—is lurking, waiting for the final blow. He hopes they can realize that this is the opportunity to destroy the enemy. (End)</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road Antique Store Robbery; Losses Amount to Hundreds of Thousands of Yuan; Female Owner and Friend Bound; Two of the Seven Robbers are Foreigners</h3>
<p>The "Sea Captain's Shop," an antique store at 119 Nanjing Road, on the first floor of the Central Mansion, run by Tornroth, an American woman residing at 14 Rue Bourgeat, specializing in various antiques and precious items such as jade and diamonds, was suddenly broken into by seven robbers at around 8:00 PM last night. One of them was a foreigner. Two robbers were watching outside the door, and the other five drew pistols, ordering everyone to remain silent. They produced pre-prepared ropes,绑ing the store owner Tornroth and her friend Hanson, and stuffing their mouths with cotton. One robber guarded them with a gun while the other four began searching everywhere for a long time. A large number of jade antiques and other valuable items, valued at five to sixty thousand yuan, were stolen. After obtaining the loot, the robbers fled without a trace. The store immediately reported the incident to the local police station, which dispatched detectives and patrol cars to search for the robbers, but they had already escaped far away. An investigation was conducted at the scene to aid in the investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Female Guide's Jewelry</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, the Jincheng Singing Girl Agency at 8 Lane 105 Guangxi Road received a phone call from a Mr. Chen in room 6 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Xiaqing Road, requesting a female guide. The agency sent Hua Meili. After arriving at the Oriental Hotel, Hua Meili entered the room and saw three men, one in Chinese dress and one in Western dress. One of the men stood up, greeted Hua Meili, and invited her to sit down. They chatted and laughed happily. Around 11:00 PM, the three men suddenly became stern, demanding Hua Meili's ring and watch. Hua Meili refused. The three men then threatened her with knives, tied her hands and feet with ropes, and stuffed her mouth with cotton. They stole two gold rings, a watch, and several yuan in cash from her wallet, then left one after another, locking the door and fleeing without a trace. After a long time, Hua Meili managed to untie herself and reported the incident to the tea room, who then reported it to the police station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate and apprehend the robbers.</p>

<h3>Sixth Charity Basketball Challenge: Shanghai Qing vs. Paramount Tomorrow Night; All Special Honorary Seats Sold Out; Mr. Songting Mao Wins First Ticket</h3>
<p>The final act of Shanghai's highly popular charity basketball challenge, Shanghai Qing vs. Paramount, has been set for tomorrow night at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA gymnasium after Shanghai Qing confirmed that there would be no extension. Before the game, there will be two interludes: a women's performance and a Sino-Western exhibition match. In addition to the awards ceremony, which will be combined with the chrysanthemum charity sale at the Great China Swimming Pool on the 24th of this month, a closing ceremony and ball auction will be held tomorrow night, presided over by Mr. Yuan. The Nanyang Middle School band will also perform on site. All ten special honorary seats were sold out after the bidding continued yesterday afternoon. Details and the order of events for tomorrow night are listed below.</p>
<p>Tomorrow Night's Order</p>
<p>Youyou Jingwu (Women's Performance) 7:30 PM</p>
<p>Giant vs. Paramount B (Sino-Western Match) 8:10 PM</p>
<p>Shanghai Qing vs. Paramount (Challenge Match) 9:00 PM</p>
<p>Bidding for Tickets</p>
<p>The bidding for the tenth special honorary seat continued yesterday afternoon, with two sides showing a three-way trend, making it impossible to produce a winner for a while. Mr. Yuan, along with his secretaries Cheng Zhiliang and Chen Shengyuan, personally received the bids. From 11:00 AM, the two phones in Mr. Yuan's office rang non-stop, making it difficult to handle all the calls. Soon, Mr. Songting Mao, the eldest son of local industrialist Mao Heqing, initially bid 130 yuan. At the same time, Zhou Junhua and his brother Junli also bid 220 yuan and 210 yuan, respectively, for the first and third tickets. Thus, Mrs. Li's standard price of 200 yuan was broken. After Mr. Yuan电询ed Mrs. Li, she expressed her willingness to increase her bid to take the lead. However, Mrs. Li was very modest, as the Zhou brothers were the younger brothers of Zhou Junxian. During the charity ball auction last week, Mrs. Li outbid Zhou's 1,000 yuan with a top bid of 1,100 yuan. Therefore, she decided to concede the first honorary ticket to the Zhou brothers, allowing them to take the lead. However, Mrs. Li was happy to contribute and expressed her willingness to spend 350 yuan to buy all the honorary tickets from the fourth to the tenth. The benevolent and righteous actions of the Mao, Zhou, and Li families are truly admirable. It is also heard that although this decision by Li Hengzhai was made by his mother, he is scheduled to return to Shanghai today and will participate in the charity ball auction tomorrow night. At the same time, industrialist Zhou Junxian has expressed his decision to join the bidding group.</p>
<p>Ticket Sales Locations</p>
<p>The news reported yesterday about the twelve Chinese and foreign celebrities signing the tickets contained some inaccuracies. The four foreign celebrities, including Inspector-General Ke Zijie of the Public Works Department, Superintendent Philippe, British Consul George, and Captain Little, will be invited by Nanyang Middle School to attend the chrysanthemum charity sale held at the school, not to sign the tickets. However, the eight Chinese celebrities who have decided to sign the tickets will indeed sign them as a souvenir. As for the 10-yuan honorary tickets and the 5-yuan regular tickets, the number is still limited to 800 seats. Since the sales began, more than half have been sold. However, yesterday a large number of fans went to Nanyang Middle School to inquire about alternative sales locations, as it has been a long time and some may have forgotten. Therefore, we are reprinting the list of locations: 1. Shen Bao Office, 2. Xinwen Bao Office, 3. YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge, 4. China Amusement Company at the racecourse, 5. Hua Dong Sporting Goods Company, 6. Xie He Sporting Goods Company at 1000 Avenue Edward VII, 7. World Book Company, 8. China Book Company, 9. Commercial Press, 10. Tongyi Middle School at Rue Marigney and Avenue Foch, 11.

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Improves Secondary Education; Provinces Should Establish Advanced Training Classes for Senior and Junior High School Teachers; Measures and Key Points Promulgated to Provinces for Compliance</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News Agency) Article 13 and 14 of the regulations for Normal Colleges already stipulated that Normal Colleges could set up advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers. The Ministry of Education has now decided that secondary education in the rear provinces urgently needs improvement, and advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers should be actively prepared. The Ministry proposed a resolution from the Second Senior Normal Education Conference, with the key points of the measures for advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers as follows: (1) Provinces and cities should continue to conduct qualification examinations for secondary school teachers in accordance with the Ministry's orders. (2) Provinces and cities should give priority to recommending senior and junior high school or equivalent school teachers with more than two years of teaching experience who have failed the examination to advanced training classes in various Normal Colleges, providing them with more than one year of professional training (which can be completed in stages). (3) Students in advanced training classes for senior and junior high schools should not only make up for specialized subjects, but also study basic education subjects and research on subject-specific teaching materials. (4) Students in advanced training classes for senior and junior high schools should be exempt from tuition and board fees. (5) Funding for advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers should be raised by the education departments of each province and city, and the Ministry of Education may provide subsidies as appropriate. Each class should raise at least 20,000 yuan. (6) Students in advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers who pass the examination and are confirmed by the Ministry of Education will be given a certificate of advanced training for teachers in certain subjects in senior and junior high schools and equivalent schools by the Normal College. This certificate is equivalent to a certificate of qualification for senior and junior high school teachers. (7) Students in advanced training classes for senior and junior high school teachers should return to their original schools to teach as a general principle after completing their training and passing the examination. Those with excellent results should be given preferential treatment by the educational administrative agencies of the province and city. (8) Separate regulations will be issued for individual advanced training programs for senior and junior high school teachers.</p>

<h3>Finance Foreign Exchange Experiences Another Surge</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday saw HSBC's listed rates remain unchanged. The unofficial rates for British and American currency weakened slightly, but initially, speculators still entered the market, briefly causing prices to loosen. The US dollar reached 5.9875. However, in the afternoon, operators, buoyed by positive news, aggressively bought, leading to a tightening trend. As a result, British gold closed at 3-bent 76.5625, and the US dollar at 5.78125, down 0.046875 and 0.0625 respectively, compared to the previous day. The futures trend mirrored the spot market.</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Also Conclude Transactions</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London cable rate for the near term fell by 0.0625, while the forward rate remained stable. The New York silver price remained unchanged, and the London gold spot price was fixed. The exchange rate between the British and American currencies was unchanged, while the rate against Shanghai was also stable. The US dollar rose two and a half against the British pound, one cent against Shanghai, and there was no market for the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained as before. Banks opened in the morning with spot selling prices of 3-bent 81.25 for British gold and 5.84375 for the US dollar, unchanged from the previous day's closing prices. After the opening, Chinese speculators sold off, making the market quite firm, with Datong Bank and an American bank selling US dollars for this month at 5.875. Later, due to some buying interest from Chinese banks, the trend stabilized slightly, with Chinese banks and speculators buying US dollars for this month at 5.84375. At that time, foreign firms also came to settle transactions, buying US dollars for October delivery at 5.84375. HSBC's listed rates were announced and remained unchanged. The silver equalization tax was announced, down 0.25 percent. At this point, the spot US dollar weakened to 5.8125, but soon speculators continued to sell, and the market returned to equilibrium. Speculators sold East Asian US dollars for this month at 5.84375. Later, speculators tried to buy at this price but were unsuccessful, so the closing condition remained weak, with British gold at 3-bent 79.6875 and the US dollar at 5.8125, up 0.015625 and 0.03125 respectively, compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>British and American Currencies Both Tighten</p>
<p>The post-market trend remained tight. Speculators first bought US dollars for this month at 5.8125. The Beneficial Bank bought British gold for this month at 3-bent 78.125. Furthermore, HSBC also absorbed US dollars for this month at 5.78125 from the American Datong Bank. The evening closing price was 3-bent 76.5625 for British gold and 5.78125 for the US dollar for this month, the same as the spot price. British gold for November was 3-bent 75, and the US dollar was 5.75, down 0.046875 for both spot and futures British gold, and up 0.0652 for the US dollar, compared to the previous day's closing.</p>
<p>Hong Kong US Dollar Eases</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 17th (Thursday) - The foreign exchange market opened steady this morning, with no changes in British, American, and Japanese currencies. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot fell by one yuan to 391 yuan. At 11:30, it was stable. The spot US dollar strengthened by 0.0625 to 23 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate for spot rose by one yuan to 392 yuan, with other rates unchanged. At 11:55, it was stable. The spot US dollar continued to ease by 0.0625 to 23.0625 yuan.

The unofficial rate for "Joint Currency" rebounded by 1.5 yuan to 79.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Short Squeeze Trend Expands - Gold Market Uptrend Revives</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market in Shanghai suddenly surged, with prices soaring past the 5,700 yuan mark. The main reason was the expansion of the short squeeze trend and the dramatic tightening of foreign exchange, which stimulated sentiment in all quarters. In the morning, most players with substantial capital were still hesitant to engage in long positions. Although some banks and money shops were eager to cover their short positions, securities firms and gold dealers were also actively selling. As a result, the market opened at 5,670 yuan and fluctuated between 5,645 yuan and 5,680 yuan without significant movement. In the afternoon, rumors of favorable news and the sudden tightening of foreign exchange spurred banks to continue covering their short positions as before. Securities firms further increased their long positions, and retail investors also engaged in long positions, causing prices to leap upward to 5,775 yuan. Eventually, many profit-taking retail investors sold off, causing a slight pullback, and the market closed at 5,738 yuan, up 98 yuan. Trading volume was not strong, totaling 4,000 taels. Gold ornaments rose 10 yuan, reaching 590 yuan. Customs gold, etc., remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Squeezed by Nearly 100 Yuan</p>
<p>Although the foreign exchange market was calm in the early morning, there were only buyers and no sellers in the market, pushing up the opening price by several tens of yuan. A money shop bought ten taels from a gold dealer for 5,670 yuan. Before long, as the foreign exchange market reported strengthening, gold dealers and securities firms came to sell, which immediately caused a setback. A bank sold 20 taels to a money shop for 5,645 yuan. However, at this time, a certain gold dealer and money shop were very eager to buy, aggressively purchasing several tens of taels, which pushed the price back up. A bank bought 20 taels from a gold dealer for 5,680 yuan. Then, under the dumping pressure from securities firms and banks, the price moved downward again. A bank sold 20 taels to a gold dealer for 5,645 yuan. However, near noon, due to the weakening of foreign exchange, sellers decreased, and the situation turned upward again. A bank traded 20 taels for 5,680 yuan. At the close, a gold dealer sold ten taels to a bank for 5,675 yuan, and after the close, the asking price was 5,690 yuan. In the afternoon, at the opening, a bank first bought 20 taels from a gold dealer for 5,690 yuan. At this time, bank groups were buying, and foreign exchange was also tightening, immediately pushing the price past the 5,700 yuan mark. A bank bought 20 taels from a gold dealer for 5,740 yuan. Later, the gold dealer sold off slightly, slightly suppressing the price by several tens of yuan. A money shop sold ten taels to a gold dealer for 5,690 yuan. However, banks and securities firms jointly aggressively bought, causing the price to jump sharply. A securities firm bought 20 taels from a money shop, and the price had already risen to 5,775 yuan. Unexpectedly, gold dealers and banks seized the opportunity to sell heavily, causing another fall back to 5,730 yuan. However, in the evening close, a securities firm bought 20 taels from a gold dealer, and the price had recovered to 5,738 yuan, up 98 yuan compared to the previous day. The total fluctuation for the day was 130 yuan. The selling price of spot gold from the gold shops was several tens of yuan higher than spot gold, and the buying price was more than 30 yuan lower. The spot gold was more than 50 yuan lower than the listed price, and there were hardly any trades.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Also Increase by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments per tael in jewelry stores did not change initially, but at 2:30 PM, it increased by ten yuan. As a result, Da Tong Heng suspended the price at 690 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng's price was similar to the previous price, with the buying price about 30 yuan lower.</p>
<h3>Spot Gold Lacks Chips - Focus on Futures Trading</h3>
<p>The unofficial spot gold market, under special circumstances, once reached its peak. Operators and those engaged in buying and selling sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. However, this type of trading was limited to spot gold. Although there were also buying long and selling short, there were always actual goods prepared. In the past, delivery was sufficient. However, due to the abundance of floating capital in this city, wealthy individuals and general merchants all bought gold for storage, and even secretly bought in huge amounts. The current chips have already become scarce, and delivery among peers has proven ineffective. Therefore, recent trading has been extremely scarce, and the fluctuations have expanded considerably. It is heard that the market authorities will reform and plan to focus solely on futures trading, with settlement based on the closing price upon expiration. (Hao)</p>
<h3>US Dollar Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign currency market, the spot gold price suddenly surged, and British and American gold pounds also rose by two yuan each. British gold notes remained mostly unchanged. US dollar notes initially retreated to 16.48 yuan, then gradually rose. In the afternoon, the upward trend was strong, once rising to 16.85 yuan. There were also rumors that commercial activities between Japanese and American foreign firms would temporarily cease tonight, but the final price was 16.78 yuan, up 20 cents compared to the previous day. Hong Kong notes rose slightly by one cent. The upward trend of Japanese gold notes and Korean notes was even stronger, with the former rising to 1.4 yuan and the latter to 1.37 yuan.</p>
<h3>Food - Large Batch of Foreign Rice Arrives</h3>
<p>Foreign rice is arriving continuously, and the market continues to soften. A batch of 7,500 tons will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, and overseas prices are also being lowered due to favorable exchange rates and cheap production. Yesterday, Jin Fa continued to sell 300 tons of No. 1 Saigon rice at 77.8 yuan, and 500 tons of No. 2 at 73.6 yuan. Jian Yuan sold 1,000 tons at 74 yuan. Under the continuous orders of foreign rice, although actual sales and customer stockpiling are absorbing the supply due to the low prices, the market is ultimately difficult to support. As a result, the price of each type of foreign rice fell slightly by two or three cents in the morning and then continued to fall by half a yuan in the afternoon. Trading volume was light, with less than 5,000 bags traded for the entire day. The later trend remained weak and sluggish.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Still Show Little Progress</h3>
<p>There is still little progress in the flour market. Because the customer groups have no actual needs, only the local street market has actual sales, and the quantity is not significant. Because the supply from various factories is limited, it is ultimately impossible to supply universally. Therefore, various flour mills are using foreign flour as a substitute. Yesterday, it was heard that more than 1,000 bags of Pao Tai brand and San Jiao brand foreign flour were traded in the local street market, with prices ranging from 19 yuan to 18.85 yuan. Because orders are due to arrive, sentiment is quite firm. The old Che Pai brand returned goods, even as a special local sales product, has rebounded to 19.1 yuan due to the depletion of supplies. It is heard that there were also two to three hundred bags traded in the local street market, and the market is as firm as usual.</p>
<p>The wheat market is still showing little development. Because domestic and foreign sources are both difficult to unblock, and the goods arriving are scarce, sellers are unusually aggressive. However, although Japanese factories are willing to take action, they are unwilling to lower their prices. Chinese factories are unable to purchase them for the time being due to the difficulty of transporting them into the concession. It is heard that the asking price in the market is still 27 yuan to 25 yuan, and even if there is a transaction, it is only a sporadic embellishment of one or two hundred bags.</p>
<h3>Securities - Foreign Stocks Reappear Prosperous - Domestic Debt Turns Dull</h3>
<p>The securities market was increasingly sluggish yesterday. There were a few trades in the morning, but only types A and C saw any activity in the afternoon, while the rest were ignored. The atmosphere in the market was quiet. Trading was relatively more frequent yesterday morning, and market prices remained unchanged. Only No. 24 was slightly sold, and Heng Fu was slightly bought. Trading declined even further in the afternoon. One Type A stock traded at a market price of 5,000, and one Type C stock traded at a market price of 30,000 to 40,000. The rest were completely ignored. As a result, market prices saw highs and lows of only five cents and one dime. The total turnover was approximately 300,000 yuan. A brief and clear table is listed below.</p>
<p>For stock transactions, 100 shares of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company were traded at a price of 7 yuan. The opening of the Nichi Zhong Industry stock market was stable. Although rumors were still rampant, they had been widely ignored. The market situation turned firmer in the afternoon, and the prosperous image of the past reappeared. Confidence seemed to be completely restored. If the situation does not change, the market should be able to make further progress. Jardine Matheson's shares rose sharply, and the shares of various Dutch East Indies rubber companies also increased significantly.</p>
<p>London, 16th (Wednesday) - Today, the listed prices of Chinese government bonds and Far East British companies' shares remain flat, and the market conditions are generally unchanged. The British Shanghai Bank, managed by the foreign firm, has set its second interim dividend for 1940 on November 8th, at one yuan per share (national currency).</p>
<p>The Bertam Consolidated Rubber Company, managed by the Huifeng Foreign Firm, has set its interim dividend for 1940 on October 31st, at ten cents per share (national currency).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Yarn and Cloth Markets Fluctuate - Resale Prices Rise and Fall Indeterminately</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market, which fell the previous day, rebounded again today, exhibiting a "yarn malaria" phenomenon, rising and falling suddenly, which is very difficult to grasp. This is partly due to the fact that speculators enter and exit from time to time. When chips are tight, it rises rapidly, and when they are released, it falls. From this perspective, the yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation, but actual sales remain sluggish.</p>
<p>At the start of the current yarn market, morale turned weak, but there were still those in the market who dragged in small orders, so the first market showed another increase. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 1,225 yuan, which soon rose to 1,229 yuan. Then, as long positions were settled and scalpers sold off, it fell again, hovering at 1,218 yuan to 1,219 yuan. Suddenly, it fell to 1,210 yuan. When the low price appeared, long positions became very active. New buyers believed that the downward trend had passed and that it could turn to a good side. So everyone pulled each other, dragging each other in, rising straight to 1,248 yuan. Unexpectedly, it lost ten yuan in an instant, and the closing price was 1,244 yuan. It is estimated that 5,500 bales were traded in half a day. The amount of purchases made by each industry association is recorded below:</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Outside Speculation - Ultimately More Losses Than Gains</h3>
<p>In the past week, the cotton yarn market in the isolated island has been particularly lively, with people whispering, shouting, and arguing. The betting with money in hand shows each person's vision and displays their skills. The cutthroat market is as fast as lightning, fluctuating up and down, making it impossible to grasp. Buying low and selling high can be said to be the consensus of all people. The only difference lies in the sensitivity and slowness of perception. The sensitive ones take precedence, and the slow ones lag behind. Therefore, the sensitive "earn" and the slow "lose." But occasionally, there are also opposites, the sensitive "lose" and the slow "earn," although it is said that the visions are different, but it is also based on the fortune. Observing the situation in the yarn market, there are more "outside" speculators and fewer "insider" speculators. Some of the outsiders who are accustomed to speculating in foreign exchange, foreign currencies, gold, or rice, wheat, and flour are feeling tired, so they are attracted to the "cotton yarn speculation" to change their taste. As for the insiders, because they have suffered in futures yarn, in this autumn of ever-changing international situation, it is better to be down-to-earth, do factory orders (spot), or act as an agent for customers, or buy in themselves, and do as much business as they have the financial capacity to do, and secure a solid foundation. Outsiders are mostly blindly following, so there are more losses than gains, and there are few who are not overwhelmed by the waves. On the morning of the 9th of this month (last Wednesday), the writer, on behalf of a certain gentleman from a customer in Bengbu (a large grain merchant), placed a double horse futures yarn order for ten bales at a certain yarn number, with the price being 1,174 yuan at the market midpoint, and a deposit of 1,500 yuan was paid. After the order was placed, it once bounced back to 50 or 60 yuan. The customer seemed impatient. I advised him that since he had already bought it, he should rest assured and see what would happen on the 14th and 15th (after Sunday), when it would surely show its edge. Sure enough, on the morning of the 14th, the opening price reached about 1,190 yuan. Unexpectedly, the customer was an amateur and was too anxious, instructing me to sell when it reached 80 yuan, which can be said to be extremely foolish. But it is difficult for an amateur to be first, and the insiders always take precedence. The best thing that the outsiders can do is to get a share of the remaining profit. Safe friends, it is better to speculate less. (Zhao)</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Indian Cotton Arrives at Port and is Unloaded</h3>
<p>The current cotton situation is still firm. Everyone believes that inventory is trending weak, so they are hoping for the best. According to cotton merchants, the amount of Indian cotton ordered from overseas by telegram in the past two days has been huge, and it can arrive in Shanghai in three weeks, with a profit of 30 to 40 yuan per dan, so some people are risking buying it.</p>
<p>Another message states that the price of foreign cotton cloth and the New York cotton market initially showed firmness. Later, due to the purchases of speculators and the influence of high Wall Street stock prices, the closing price was 3 to 5 points higher than the previous day. The Indian market was quiet. Yesterday, the forecast rose by half a rupee.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, the buying intentions from all parties were quite strong. Fellow traders who had goods on hand were unwilling to sell them, so there were not many transactions. Fellow traders generally continued to be bullish on raw cotton.</p>
<p>A large batch of Indian cotton arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, the British company's Elifura (transliteration) ship arrived from Mumbai, carrying 8,400 tons of cotton, which is equivalent to more than 25,200 pieces, and docked at Pudong Qichang Wharf for unloading.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains - Soybeans Turn Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market, because Tianjin beans were arriving at the same time (with 10,000 packages on the way), some cargo owners dumped prices to sell, resulting in a tired market atmosphere and a small shake. After that, exporters from Hong Kong and Guangdong purchased 1,000 packages of Qingdao beans, so the weary wind stopped, and the overall situation was stabilized. The broad bean sales market is usually only busy for a certain period, so the current Qing and Bai beans are inevitably split. The route of Qingpi is only moving slightly in the local street, and development is inevitably weak. Baimi's northbound transportation by Japanese merchants is still lively, so the momentum is quite optimistic. Yesterday, Shangjin merchants purchased 1,500 to 1,600 packages of eggplant peel silkworm (price details in the market price column), and the local street inquired about various Qingpi silkworms more than 500 packages. Except for the firmness of high-quality goods, the rest were as flat and tired as before.</p>
<p>Yesterday (17th), there were also 5,510 packages of soybeans transported from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market - Dutch Raw Sugar Opens at 7,000 Packages</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market benefited from foreign exchange, and fatigue reappeared. The guild's market price was: current spot for No. 24 coarse white, 75 yuan, a small five cents for local merchants, 74.7 yuan, a small three cents for foreign merchants, and 59 yuan, a small half yuan for re-exported goods. Dutch raw sugar current spot was 57 yuan to 56.87 yuan, a small seven cents, and road goods were 56.6 yuan, and Tianxiang Foreign Firm opened 7,000 packages at a price of US$2.5, OIF example. Taikoo Car White B mark was 73 yuan, a small five cents for the West warehouse, and 72.5 yuan, also a small five cents for the East warehouse. DY mark was 69.8 yuan for the West warehouse, and HX mark was 68.9 yuan, a small two and three cents for the East warehouse.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods - Cangzhou Red Dates Offer New Products - Sichuan Fungus Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>The first batch of new Cangzhou red dates has arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, 138 packages were opened, with a price of 75 yuan, which is almost double the market price of the previous old goods.</p>
<p>Sichuan fungus, recently, has become scarce, and the market situation is frequently tight. It used to be priced at 500 yuan, but now it has been raised to 540 yuan for those that are unopened. Yesterday, it was priced at 560 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes - Raw Oil Falls Again by Two or Three Yuan - Soybean Oil Market Also Drops</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grain and oil market saw a sharp decline. The current spot price of raw oil fell again by two or three yuan. It is estimated that dozens of barrels of Jiaozhou raw oil opened at a price of 72.5 yuan to 74 yuan. As for the soybean oil market, because the market inventory is abundant, it is only controlled by a small number of people, and the market has become a falsely tight situation. Once there is pressure, the market will not be able to support it. The price of Dayou Factory oil opened at 85 yuan. Yesterday (17th), there were also 2,980 cans and 350 pieces of raw oil, and 500 pieces of soybean oil, all transported from Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Speculation is Active - Selling Prices Rise and Fall Indeterminately</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth - Yesterday, the cloth market fluctuated, falling in the morning and rebounding in the afternoon. This is because there is speculation in the market at present. In actual trading, the price rises and then there are releases. When it is low, there are also draggings. Therefore, the selling price changes rapidly in an instant. In the morning market, fine cloth and twill each fell by two and a half to five cents per piece. Near noon, it rebounded by about five cents. The opening prices of coarse cloth and bleached cloth remained unchanged. Stockpilers were active, and in the afternoon, they were even more prosperous. The local street traded more than 1,000 pieces of coarse and fine cloth, colored cloth, and grey fabrics such as poplin and satin, and printed goods. Actual sales were still flat. Guangdong and Hong Kong buyers purchased more than 300 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill. Yantai buyers purchased nearly 200 yuan of heavyweight coarse cloth.</p>
<p>East Cloth - It was flat first and then rose, and the situation was very firm. The 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 37.67 yuan in the morning. Then, because the fellow traders and stockpilers had a strong appetite, the market atmosphere turned tight, and the asking price frequently increased. The closing price of the Dragon Head fine cloth rose to 38.15 yuan per piece. The Four Gentlemen's serge was 1.1575 yuan per yard.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics and Clothing Steadily Rising - Sales are More Prosperous Than Before</h3>
<p>Since more people are wearing suits, the sales of woolen, cotton, and knitted fabrics have expanded accordingly. Whether it is for men or women, it is more than before the war. Because prices have risen sharply, Shanghai-woven woolen fabrics have become popular and occupy the most advantageous position in the current woolen fabric market. Furthermore, judging from the business of clothing stores on various roads, the most prosperous are the luggage tailors on Daxin Street and in the inner streets. The business of clothing stores on Xiafei Road, Sichuan Road, and Nanjing Road has decreased compared to the spring. High-end buyers are turning to mid-range, and mid-range buyers are turning to low-end, mostly because they feel that they lack the financial resources to make new clothes.</p>
<h3>Hardware - Flat Folded Iron Sales Are Active</h3>
<p>Flat folded iron sales have been severely hit since the Changjiang gang stopped doing business. In the past, both because can manufacturers, toy factories, cigarette factories, and machine factories in the local street have slightly adopted it, the market has slightly improved. However, because transactions are not widespread, the market price remains stable at the old price, such as 150 yuan per 200 pounds (equivalent to two bundles) for selected goods, and 130 yuan for each case of patterned goods. It is estimated that the actual sales in the market yesterday were approximately 100 cases.</p>
<h3>Blue Lead is Flat - Iron Billets Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>The blue lead market is not showing how high or low it is because the supply is insufficient and the transactions are also light. It is estimated that the foreign merchant group showed some intention to enter yesterday, and it is heard that the asking price is still around 110 yuan.</p>
<p>The iron billet market saw several tens of bundles absorbed by thermos factories in the past two days. In addition, iron printing factories and billet manufacturers also occasionally searched for entry, so the market is not lonely, and sentiment is excellent because of this. The market price is gradually rising. It is estimated that the transaction price in the market yesterday has reached 1,100 yuan per bundle, and the asking price of fellow traders is still 1,150 yuan to 1,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea - Silk Exports Still Shrinking</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market suddenly took a turn for the worse, with the American market showing even more weakness. New York spot prices fell five points, a drop of one dime and four cents from the previous two days, while forward prices fell three and a half points, a drop of one dime and one cent from the previous day. Yokohama was closed yesterday for a holiday, so there was no market. However, the buying interest of foreign firms in this port has weakened. Currently, the cost of transporting Wuxi raw silk to Shanghai is around 600 yuan per bale, plus a special tax of 110 yuan, making the burden not light. Therefore, prices in Shanghai are holding firm, and no transactions were reported yesterday.</p>

<h3>In Front of the Pawnshop</h3>
<p>— Shui Rong</p>
<p>Have you ever seen a dignified seven-foot man shed tears?</p>
<p>I have. Just today. He stood like a log inside the doorway of a pawnshop, clutching a pawn ticket in his hand, large teardrops falling down his gaunt face. Falling.</p>
<p>Behind him was that terrifyingly large character for "pawn."</p>
<p>(Was it the exploitation of the exceedingly shrewd shop assistant? Was it that the price of the pawn could not buy a measure of rice? Was it the cold, with thin clothes, and no ability to redeem a lined jacket, a cotton coat?)</p>
<p>The gaunt face and the shoulder blades hidden beneath the blue cloth short shirt were twitching, twitching.</p>
<p>But I could not hear his crying. I could not tell whether it was because he was only sobbing, or because it was swallowed up by the city's noise.</p>
<p>On the street, buses roared. Cars honked. Rickshaws jostled. People also jostled. This formed a river of life. Flowing, flowing. Everyone struggled: pushing people, being pushed, everyone fearing falling behind, fearing becoming dregs.</p>
<p>Many people ran past that pawnshop door, that worker. Running past without a glance.</p>
<p>Everyone appeared so hurried, self-absorbed; without sympathy, without mutual aid!</p>
<p>"Brother, what's wrong?" My lips were moving, I wanted to shout that to him.</p>
<p>But suddenly, a dirty body bumped into me full on, and slipped away. Following closely were the sounds of leather boots and the whistling of a leather whip!</p>
<p>I was startled and ran away.</p>
<h3>Promoting Cremation</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ji</p>
<p>According to reports: "Since the formation of the isolated island in this port, the population density has increased, and the number of corpses and coffins has also increased compared to before. According to the Municipal Council's statistics, the number of deaths in Shanghai has also increased due to population crowding. Last month, the number of corpses cremated totaled 2,287, while the number of coffins sent reached 39,107."</p>
<p>Regardless of whether we consider the cremated corpses or the coffined corpses, the combined total was so large last month, but this is a fact: there were 39,107 coffined corpses, and 2,287 cremated corpses; the coffined corpses accounted for the majority. But we cannot ignore that there were also 2,287 cremated corpses.</p>
<p>In our society with its customs and habits, if a person dies and is to be "cremated," this can truly be said to be a major event. When a monk passes away, sitting in a large vat to be cremated, it is treated as an interesting event to rush to watch the spectacle; but if someone asks him if it would be good to be cremated when he dies, then he would strongly oppose it, "I am not a monk." If elderly people's descendants want to cremate them, that is even seen as great rebellion and unfilial piety. In fact, is this not superstition at work, believing that people still have a "soul" after death? Human awareness is because of the "soul," so even though the physical body is stiff and cold, if it is to be cremated, it is very painful. As for monks who are cremated after passing away, that is because they have completed their cultivation and ascended to heaven.</p>
<p>In fact, there were originally no coffins in ancient times, and if people died, they were abandoned in ravines. It was not until the time of Yu that "tile coffins" were used, and during the Xia Dynasty, "堲周" were used, but they were all made of earth and not wood. It was not until the Yin Dynasty that wooden coffins began to be used. It can be seen that using coffins to hold corpses was not originally a big deal; it was just that later generations played around in order to "preserve corpses well." However, can "corpses" ultimately be preserved well? Won't they still rot after a certain amount of time? So I say: when people die, that's it, setting a fire to burn them is the most straightforward thing to do. I often tell my friends: there are three dramas to be performed in a person's life. When you are born, you celebrate the "full month," your parents carry you in and out for people to admire. When you reach adulthood and get married, that is even a "great comedy." Until you die of old age, they still want to play with you for a while. Now there are funeral homes, so they dress you up as if you were still alive. I always feel that this is a drama, but it is a "tragedy."</p>
<p>In fact, "cremation" is not a recent "invention." It was already very "popular" during the Song Dynasty. This is a historically verifiable fact that no one can deny. In addition to being straightforward, cremation also has a benefit: it can reduce the amount of farmland occupied by the "dead." In the farmlands of us Chinese people, there are mounds and mounds, all over the province are mounds of graves. If another five hundred or a thousand years pass, wouldn't the farmlands be entirely occupied by the "dead"? Therefore, cremation can free up a lot of arable land for increased production.</p>
<p>Last month's cremation numbers were as high as 2,287, and I think it was because Shanghai was formed into an isolated island, a matter of necessity! But I want to suggest to everyone (who would be willing to accept this suggestion?): promote cremation. In addition to being straightforward and reducing the amount of farmland occupied by the "dead," there is also the fact that burning corpses feels much more "hygienic." Currently, everything is expensive, and coffins cannot be an exception. Even if poor people want to die, they "cannot afford to die," so cremation can save money and really avoids being buried in shoddy coffins, giving the living people a threat of infection.</p>
<p>I advocate cremation, and Shanghai should have a special "funeral home" for cremation (I don't know if this name is appropriate).</p>

<h3>The Homecoming of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 9 - The Chauffeur's News</p>
<p>When I parked in front of number 27 Qingpu Road, I saw a thin man dressed in black standing at the corner of Datong Road. As soon as this man saw me get out of the car, he slowly walked away, looking rather suspicious. This person seemed to be a detective sent to monitor the place, but I did not recognize him. I did not worry about it and pushed open the iron gate with the floral pattern and walked in. The iron gate was ajar. I pushed the gate open very gently. When I walked inside, I did not see anyone. The yellow gauze curtains in the reception room were tightly drawn, and it was quiet without a sound. I first took a look at Old Mao's gatehouse on the right-hand side, but the door was closed. I went directly to the entrance of the gatehouse and tapped on the door twice with my finger, but there was no response. I turned the doorknob, and it was also ajar and not locked. Old Mao was not inside, but his dirty old yellow leather shoes were left under a small square table. I walked in and picked up a leather shoe and looked at it. There was indeed a hole in the sole. I took out a soft ruler from my pocket and measured it. It was indeed eleven inches and six.</p>
<p>This discovery could not help but make me feel delighted. So this Old Mao was also involved! But just as I put the leather shoe back in its place and turned around to leave the gatehouse, I suddenly saw the gray-haired Old Mao standing outside the door, his small, round rat-like eyes staring at me in shock. He had already changed into a pair of black serge cloth-topped shoes. Then he opened his toothless lips and spoke to me.</p>
<p>"Sir, you—you—" He clearly wanted to ask what I was doing in his room, but he did not dare to ask directly because he was concerned about something.</p>
<p>I replied, "Old Mao, I've come to find you."</p>
<p>"Find me? What's the matter?"</p>
<p>I felt it was difficult to answer. Of course, I did not want to tell him the story of examining his leather shoes. I vaguely said, "What are you doing inside?"</p>
<p>Old Mao waited a moment and replied, "I was answering the phone. A Miss Bao Yu called, and a Miss Wang was playing mahjong—this Miss Bao is also a good friend of Miss Wang, and she doesn't know that Miss Wang has been beaten to death. I told her this information, and she said she would come here immediately." He paused, looked at me, and seemed to feel that I was not paying much attention to his report, so he brought up his previous question again. "Sir, what do you want from me?"</p>
<p>I casually replied, "I want you to go and inform your Old Master Li, and ask him to come downstairs and talk to me for a few words."</p>
<p>Old Mao's rat-like eyes were still fixed on my face, as if he felt that my answer was just made up on the spot. He clearly suspected that I had some purpose in walking into his gatehouse. He shook his head and said, "Sir, you want to see Old Master Li? He is not upstairs." (139)</p>
<h3>Public Notice to Society Regarding the Current Epidemic</h3>
<p>— Zhang Juying</p>
<p>Dengue fever was first discovered and became prevalent in Java and other places in 1790. Later, it became rampant in the tropics. Forty years ago, there was a severe epidemic in Shantou, Chaozhou, Xiamen, and other places in China. It often affects coastal areas, spreading rapidly and widely, becoming a major menace of epidemics. The disease is transmitted by the yellow fever mosquito. The description of the rising and falling nature of the fever is very detailed. Initially, it manifests as chills and fever, the prodromal febrile phase. During this phase, the fever gradually rises, reaching its peak on the third or fourth day, followed by sweating, diarrhea, and intermittent fever. The patient feels weak. After the high fever subsides, they feel slightly better; this is the so-called intermittent phase, or afebrile phase. It can last from twelve hours to three days, varying in duration. Then, the fever returns, even higher than before, entering the terminal febrile phase, also known as the secondary febrile phase. During this phase, pain symptoms become more pronounced, possibly even more severe than before. As for the rash, the face initially turns red and flushed, with apparent congestive spots on the facial skin (sometimes only blood-colored marks are visible); this is the so-called initial rash. Then, most rashes appear (sometimes appearing during the intermittent phase); this is the so-called late rash. This rash has no fixed appearance; it may resemble a maculopapular rash, or resemble measles, or be scattered and similar to scarlet fever, or resemble papules, or flat lichen. Mostly, it resembles measles.</p>
<p>The above is the standard disease pattern of dengue fever. Apart from this, there are cases that do not conform to the above standard, but are indeed this disease: firstly, no initial rash appears; secondly, some may not have a very high body temperature. Furthermore, this disease rarely has complications, but children may have seizures, or the fever may return after two weeks, or the condition may worsen due to misdiagnosis.</p>
<p>This is not a domestic disease, but an imported one. However, many Western doctors also overlook it, failing to pay attention, or misdiagnosing it as typhoid fever due to the decrease in white blood cells. However, the high fever with slow pulse, the absence of the Widal reaction in blood tests, and the intermittent nature of the fever pattern then reveal that it is not typhoid fever. Or, it may be suspected to be measles, but there is no catarrh of the nose and no Koplik's spots, and the rash first appears on the face, so it is also not measles. Or, it may be scarlet fever, but scarlet fever has a fast pulse, pharyngitis, and an increase in white blood cells, which is also very different. If Western doctors, when diagnosing Western diseases, still seem doubtful and unable to diagnose, how can the doctors in the market, who live in a drunken dream and make a living selling fermented soybeans and bean curd rolls, treat it? I am not boasting about my discovery, but specifically informing people in society that the disease is not a serious condition, so they should not be like blind men riding blind horses, carelessly taking medicine. I hope that a disease that starts peacefully and pleasantly will remain peaceful and pleasant to the end. (End)</p>

<h3>Shirley Temple's Playroom</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>After Shirley Temple left the film industry, there has been some harsh criticism from the outside world regarding her family's finances. It is said to be a rumor that the playroom built adjacent to her home is a museum, ready to be opened to the public for a fee. But in fact, this is not the case. The house was built to store Shirley's toys, hundreds of dolls, and gifts from fans. All of Shirley's parties will now be held here. Perhaps the above misunderstanding arose because her doll room is open to the public twice a year. However, in the future, two charity fundraising events will be held in this room each year: one for the "Motion Picture Relief Fund" and the other for the Children's Hospital.</p>
<h3>A First Play After Recovering from Illness</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>I have been hospitalized for treatment for illness for four months and have not held a pen during this time. Going to the theater to see a play at Huang Yulin's place was my first outing after being sick. I haven't seen the performances of Xin Yanqiu and Ru Fulan for over a decade, and the opening night's plays "Visiting the Zhuang" and "The Jade Hairpin" are their famous masterpieces, so I made a special effort to arrive before 7 o'clock, fearing that I would miss the full spectacle of Fulan's "Visiting the Zhuang". I previously heard that Fulan's eye disease had affected him, and he had switched to playing young male roles, which I deeply regretted. I did not expect that in this demanding martial young male role, not only were his stances more stable, but his fight scenes with Zhang Lianting were also skilled, agile, and full of highlights. There were several moments when the entire audience erupted in applause, earning him unanimous praise from both experts and amateurs. It is agreed that the performance of both holding one end of a spear while simultaneously doing somersaults was the most commendable. When the famous martial artist Li Chunlai from Shanghai performed "Baishuitan", he often displayed this unique skill to the audience. Fulan's somersaults were also very agile and beautiful, showing his deep skill. Among the martial artists in the old capital, only Fulan is the most disciplined and hardworking after the predecessors like Shang, Yang, and Yu. In the past, those predecessors still performed occasionally, all with majestic figures. Someone like Zhou Rui'an was even criticized as being a "small King of Frost" when he occasionally played Xiang Yu, causing Fulan to be suppressed. Although he came south several times, he was never able to become very famous. Now that the old actors have passed away, such as Wan Chun and Sheng Lin, whose stature and skills are no different from Fulan, he is still warmly welcomed by the people in the isolated island. Moreover, his qualifications are deeper, and his voice is suitable for both martial male and martial young male roles, capable of performing Kunqu and various other styles, without losing the classic style of the old school. Now, on the first day of performing martial scenes, he unexpectedly won unanimous praise. I think Fulan, who has been down on his luck for more than a decade, must also feel a little relieved, proving that those with true talent and skill will eventually have their day to shine. After "Visiting the Zhuang" was Zhou Xiaotian's "Empty City Stratagem", which was generally mediocre. Compared to the first performance when following Xiao Yunnan south, he has indeed made great progress. However, his voice is thin and high-pitched, limited by his natural endowment, and those sitting further away find it difficult to hear. However, with his ability to self-motivate and work hard, he has great potential in the future. Xin Yanqiu studied acting the earliest, has rich stage experience, and is excellent in both appearance and acting skills, with delicate performances, truly worthy of being called the "elder stateswoman" of female performers. In addition, Yu Zhenfei's young male roles are refined, elegant, and generous, adding a lot of color to the new actors. Therefore, the "Complete Jade Hairpin" was also very popular with the audience. Although the closing time on that day was slightly later than usual, and those who lived far away had no trams to take, all the audience listened until the end of the play before leaving, which also shows Yanqiu's magic.</p>
<h3>A Fusion of Chinese and Western Movie Stars – Superior Acting and Expression</h3>
<p>— Shatuo</p>
<p>Chinese and Western movie stars have many similarities in acting and expression. Here are the results of my personal observations, listed for your amusement. Although not perfectly matched, they are not too far apart:</p>
<p>(1) Wang Yuelong: Charles Laughton</p>
<p>(2) Mei Xi: James Stewart</p>
<p>(3) Gong Qiuxia: Alice Faye</p>
<p>(4) You Guangzhao: Frank McHugh</p>
<p>(5) Han Langen: Laurel</p>
<p>(6) Chen Yanyan: Bette Davis</p>
<p>(7) Yu Lin: Nan Gran</p>
<p>(8) Wang Naidong: Humphrey Bogart</p>
<p>(9) Xu Xinyuan: Sidney Toler</p>
<p>(10) Bai Yun: Ray Milland</p>
<p>(11) Yuan Meiyun: Olivia de Havilland</p>
<p>(12) Bai Hong: Myrna Loy</p>
<p>(13) Jiang Xiu: Pandro S. Berman</p>
<p>(14) Zhang Cuihong: Manuel A. Blanc</p>
<p>(15) Tan Ying: Dorothy Lamour</p>
<p>(16) Wang Yin: Victor McLaglen</p>
<p>(17) Xia Xia: Loretta Young</p>
<p>(18) Liu Qiong: Henry Fonda</p>
<h3>The Plot of "World of Qinhuai"</h3>
<p>— Niaoniao</p>
<p>Golden Star's first production, "World of Qinhuai," has been filmed and is scheduled to be shown at the Golden City Theatre soon after "Liang Hongyu." In today's wave of filming so-called "boring movies," it is still progressive for Golden Star to bring Zhang Henshui's literary works to the screen. With the wide readership of "World of Qinhuai," there will undoubtedly be a high degree of interest in the adapted film, and it is expected to be a sensation.</p>
<p>Henshui's novels are known for their plots, and the characters and settings in "World of Qinhuai" are even more fascinating. Men and women with different personalities are captivating on paper, and now they have more active performances on screen; tense moments make people tremble, tragic moments make people feel sad, exciting moments make people feel heroic, and lighthearted moments make people laugh. The interspersed stories include romances in the singing world, and the history of the powerful bullying the weak; there are also upright characters who do not pocket found money; chivalrous heroes who steal to support their mothers; lonely orphans who sell themselves for their mothers; clever and charming women who play with men; idle loafers who stir up trouble; and outstanding figures from all walks of life. The characters are portrayed as fierce tigers, as tame sheep, as women who rebel against authority, and as exceptionally intelligent beauties. There are ruthless three musketeers for gimmicks, and female heroes who eliminate evil alone. In terms of characters, there are pockmarked people, bald people, lame people, fortune tellers, small booksellers, singers, socialites, prostitutes, con artists, gangsters, and tycoons. In terms of plot, there are encounters with beauties, thefts, two kidnappings of girls, several explorations of the devil's den, the hand-killing of evil tyrants, and the burning of a giant house…</p>
<p>Since the film is mostly performed by stage actors, the acting exaggerates the plot, further exciting the audience. In short, this is a masterpiece worth recommending.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Four Quatrains on the Heroes of the Seas</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenhui</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Wei Ruhui's "Heroes of the Seas," I have composed one quatrain for each act, to express my feelings, regardless of my skill.</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Struggling in the rugged Fujian seas to restore the dynasty,</p>
<p>How can we withstand the court's treacherous obstruction?</p>
<p>You were not a disloyal subject of a fallen nation,</p>
<p>But the late emperors had many regrets.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Abandoning Xianxia Pass, ceding Fujian's territory,</p>
<p>Exhausting loyalty, serving two dynasties;</p>
<p>Most pitiful is the day the whole family was imprisoned,</p>
<p>Only then did tears of regret surge like a tide!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The drums rumble, heard for a hundred miles,</p>
<p>The warship floats on the sea, pointing to Nanjing;</p>
<p>The elders of the Central Plains should feel inspired,</p>
<p>And see the heroic banner rising again above Xiaoling.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>On the island, the Ming court's rituals alone remain,</p>
<p>The survivors vow to restore the Han mountains and rivers;</p>
<p>For over thirty years, they maintained the correct calendar,</p>
<p>Whose righteousness is more awe-inspiring than theirs!</p>
<h3>Twenty Types of Yue Opera</h3>
<p>— Written by Dongyun, Illustrated by Xiuyan</p>
<p>(5) Ni Feng Stirs Tea</p>
<p>"Ni Feng Stirs Tea" is a</p>
<p>segment from the play Double Phoenix.</p>
<p>Wen Bizheng, in order to sell himself to the Huo family, first takes the path of the matchmaker Ni. Unexpectedly, Ni's daughter, Feng Gu, a hidden gem, is also a desirable choice.</p>
<p>When Ni Fenggu saw such a handsome scholar as Wen Bizheng, she couldn't help but feel restless, causing her to make the mistake of "long scallions and short noodles" when cooking noodles.</p>
<p>(See picture)</p>
<p>(6) Nine Pine Pavilion</p>
<p>The plot of "Pearl Pagoda" also exists in Yue Opera, and the script is roughly the same as the "Ballad."</p>
<p>"Nine Pine Pavilion" is a scene after the "Gifting of the Pagoda." When Fang Qing arrived at the Nine Pine Pavilion, after discovering the secret in the "dry snacks," there are two lines in the song: "Open the package with cakes, inside are the pearl pagoda and the year and day." This is particularly absurd! Chen Cuie, a deeply sheltered young lady, is not a liberated woman of the 20th century; "Gifting the Pagoda" has its reasons, but to give away one's "year and day" to someone, her face must be very thick, not to this extent! In the "Ballad," when Fang Qing and Chen Cuie see each other again, Miss Chen indicates that "the gifting of the pagoda is not about romantic love," which is enough to explain Miss Chen's personality and intentions at the time. This point should be corrected.</p>
