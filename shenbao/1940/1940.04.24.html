<p>社評</p>
<h3>正吿阿部信行氏</h3>
<p>日本勳一等，陸軍大將，前首相，阿部信行氏近膺大使名義，專誠到中國淪陷區。本月二十一日拂曉，在他航海進了吳淞口之後，日本方面再沒有堂堂皇皇的官報，上海南京方面亦沒有熱熱鬧鬧的歡迎，他們的宣傳機關也沒有確確切切的報道；或說他尙逗留上海，或說他已逕赴南京，却不知究竟孰是孰非：總之，行踪似明似晦。原來阿部氏在他國內，眞可謂出將入相，位極人臣，榮華富貴，睥睨朝野，眞是人人側目，個個低頭；但上海南京這一帶，雖在淪陷範圍之內，祗因人心思漢，不免草木皆兵，則「大使」來來往往，亦自有其不宜太公開，不宜太鋪張的理由；正不應該在他「大使」「特使」名實難奇之際，又因不甚明瞭其行踪而視之爲「密使」吧！</p>
<p>阿部氏雖行蹤待攷，然蒞華是實；雖名實離奇，然負有使命是實；雖中外對他不怎樣關心注視，然他的主觀上有其宏願有其重任是實。惟其如此，凡在愛中國，惜日本，顧念遠東前途以及人類文明福利的人們，無論對於侵略如何深惡痛絕，而對於阿部仍必有所情不自禁而不安緘默。因爲凡百謬誤，終必糾正，謬誤愈深，貽誤愈多，爲害愈大，而糾正愈需較廣較長的空間時間；這是種種不必要的浪費，且有其相應而生的慘痛與罪惡；然則與其他日力圖糾正，寗若今日不再謬誤。謬誤的終歸糾正，是因果定律，是王道結論。阿部氏是一個有學養的人，他必能體認所謂因果定律與王道結論決非迂腐之談；他至少必能檢討日本二千六百年的史實，來證明謬誤決無悠久而穩定的成功，以此反證因果王道的不迂不腐。</p>
<p>從今逐一追溯日本對中國的種種謬誤，將太累墜；何况其間亦有一大部分事情，或爲永久不能折服日本人而使他們情甘自認爲謬誤，故逐一追溯亦復不必要。但有一基本要點，日本人非承認爲謬誤不可，即估量謬誤。日本所加於中國的砲火炸彈，竟然廣泛而深刻的喚醒了民族意識，振作了民族精神，燃燒了民族火燄；由是演進而爲統一的組織，堅强的抗戰，偉大的新生命；從此不屈不撓，不可磨滅。這是日本估量所未及，遂成一切謬誤的總樞紐。日本人祗以中國一部凌亂的歷史，自上古以迄近代，以迄民國最初二十年，作爲估量中國的唯一資料；他們一疎忽了民族意識是潛伏的先天的本能，二疎忽了民族生存權是切膚的子子孫孫的要求；三疎忽了民族領袖的卓立。歷史原來不會機械式的複演，中國今日蓬蓬勃勃的情况，自領袖乃至於老百姓，確為中國歷史所未有；自古侵略中國者所遭遇的棘手，亦為中國歷史所未有；同時，中國人也因為深深了解中國倘若遭遇了現代的滅亡，則其慘痛，亦將為中國屢决屈服於異族的歷史所未有。因此總因，得援用引伸之至於種種方面；而其間尤足供阿部氏參考的。小之，須知中國人決不以此次抗戰為政治鬥爭，而澈底確認之為民族戰爭；大之，須知中國決不屈服，務償國家獨立完整的宏願。</p>
<p>日本人有時而似乎拙笨，遠者不必說；近如荷蘭東印度羣島問題，明明美英諸國必為了他們目身痛切的利害關係而代荷蘭主張維持現狀，乃日本外交當局猶作無聊的刺探而惹起了不甚好看的反應；又如海軍質量問題，明明美英諸國決心維持五五三的比率，乃因日本企圖突破此百分之六十而引起了「吃勿消」的造艦競爭；又如蘇聯對於國際縱橫，亦擅技巧與智識，而日本不顧一切的片面宣傳其蘇聯謀與日本妥協，這明明祗供咖啡館內談助而不足以瞞過各國外交家，果然，促使蘇聯方面毅然發表其無情的否認。諸如此類，或非拙笨，祗是忠心耿耿而無所不用其極；冷靜而公道的論者，尤不願判斷日本人爲拙笨。故日本對中國。雖一面嘗試其政治戰略，一面仍謀保持其軍事點綫；雖一面憧憬於以戰養戰，一面仍不得制定龐大的戰時預算，一面聲明支助南京組織，一面仍不諱言無望於以此解決所謂事變，實現所謂和平。阿部氏在辭別東京的時候。即在日本宣傳機關方面亦未絲毫稱述其豪情勝概的眞面目，於此可見阿部氏殊不拙笨。</p>
<p>然則阿部氏辭行將何以覆命？最拙笨的，如自欺自凟，遵什麽外交途徑，辦什麽外交手續，講什麽爭與讓，想什麽訂約簽字來完成其所謂旣成事實？老實說；日本國力的總和倘夠應付國際環境而維持侵略政策，日本侵華的軍隊倘能長時期的對付中國最後的反攻，則何須訂約簽字；不然，雖訂約簽字，誰來承認他有效！無效的訂約簽字，並不能使日本所得更多，使中國所失更多，却使將來日本在糾正謬誤的時候，增加了一種不必要的顧全而减少及早糾正謬誤的勇氣與機會，或說：日本將由阿部氏訂約簽字而表示日本比現狀有所讓步。姑不問此說可信與否，更不必問所謂讓步程度；中國原無所求，但要不折不扣的國家獨立完整。阿部氏而不自欺自凟，阿部氏而有大政治家的抱負與手腕，則所以覆命者，決非一張廢紙，聊以塞責，而惟有秉其耿耿之忠，主張立即召回軍隊，根本放棄對華侵略政策，而與獨立完整的中國，共謀遠東的安定與福利。中國人最尙王道，決不拙笨，故一面期待日本幡然改圖，一面淬厲抗戰。</p>

<p>華盛頓　美國前任海軍副參謀長陶西格少將頃在參議院海軍委員會發表演說、略謂、一吾國利益顯已受遠東時局之威脅、吾人需要穩定而又獨立的中國、遠東時局依照現行情勢演進之結果、余實不知美國如何能避不捲入戰爭漩渦、是以吾人務當有所作為、俾他日不致被迫而興日本決鬥」、余主張英法荷三國務當協助美國、幷與美國進行談判、以各該國在太平洋方面之根據地、聽由美國使用、蓋日美兩國萬一發生衝突、勢必出于海戰之一途、吾國不能進兵日本、日本亦不能侵犯吾國固矣、但日本必將企圖侵犯菲律濱、則可斷言、職是之故、本人認為美國必須一方在菲律濱羣島建造「堅不可拔」之海軍根據地、一方則加緊建造主力艦繼續不輟、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>證券　外股掀然起反動　會德豐股曾一度跌去五十元　電話傳說將加價股票亦飛漲</h3>
<p>衆業公所各種股票之價格、因中外投機家之集中、波瀾倐起、大漲大跌、每為頭腦冷靜者所不取、以為橡皮風潮殷鑒小遠、自投漩渦、福不旋踵、此說實亦似是而非、目下上海游資過剩、法幣跌價、保守即係後退、投機事業已成普遍風尙、非皮相之談所可遏止、惟投機非不可、為但必須知機而後投、徒事盲從、小得必不能償大失、最近各股又大漲大跌、不知者以為黑幕重重、其實亦有其相當之理由、不過投機家利用之而已、茲略述其大槪於後、</p>
<p>此次風潮之狂暴、當首推會德豐股、票面十兩、最高價至二百七十二元、昨日一瀉數十元、其上漲原因、為一老股有照二十五元價加收一新股之權利、但漲風過速而又過份、乃引起多方之傾售而驟小、英聯與會德豐有連帶關係、行市在投資投機叢集中、致起軒然大波、此則屬於船舶碼頭股者、</p>
<p>怡和紗廠股票面五兩、去年冬季市價十七八元、最近高至七十三四元、其原因則以其所存原料旣多且賤、照現在紗價出貨、每件可盈四百元、其所出粗布、比之其他各廠每疋高一元、細布較東貨高二元、且其所出各貨、無論游擊區或淪陷區、暢行無阻、隨處可到、此則屬於紡織業股者、</p>
<p>國際信託股、揚子銀公司股、上海銀公司股、各該公司市價亦飛黃騰達、此因國際信託擁有會得豐股二萬五千股、上海銀公司因附有中國墾植股最多、揚子銀公司則因聯帶關係、亦隨市提高、此則屬於金融業者、</p>
<p>業廣票面五兩、中國營業票面十元、其趨漲則因近來地價高漲二成以上、建築材料高出數倍、工部局規定自七月份起增捐百分之五十、地產商可滿足其加租之慾望、故投資目光頗有一部份集中於此、此則屬於地產業股者、</p>
<p>其他如中國墾植、則因其門頭溝之煤礦已照常出煤、股價乃隨煤價而增高、各種橡皮股、前因荷蘭將不免捲入戰爭漩渦而大跌、近以日本對荷屬東印度宣言與美國取同樣態度而回漲、前途尙有希望、不過與荷蘭有關者祇英達區·英楂華·克羅華·楂華康沙·蘭格志·蘇門答臘橡皮等七種、不可不知、</p>
<p>昨日電話股大漲至四十元新高價、則因五月份電話費單遲遲未發、遂傳聞電話公司將於五月份起漲價、按上海電話事業亦隨投機事業而畸形發展、（一）（三）（七）（八）（九）等區域、竟有欲裝而不得、因之發生頂費、報上廣吿徵求時有見及、有謂高至千元、七八百元者有之、而遂促成電話加價之傳說、其實商業電話固然別有作用、住宅電話究屬情形不同云、</p>
<p>總之、各股因各該公司之資產巳隨市價而增高、且以衆業公所所做之各種股票均可向匯豐銀行做押款、此則投機家最大之尾閭、惟是與猶太商做對手生意、此輩手腕奧妙無窮、中國人恐非其敵、還以鄭重將事為是、母實目前之虛花、此亦可注意者也、（星）</p>
<p>昨日衆業股市因經營者態度驟易、故一般價格巳被敏銳的矯正、成交數龐大無比、用是交易所方面經常施行之便捷方法、概被置於最高利用之下、以與狀似潮湧之無限定單相匹敵、</p>
<p>會德豐股昨被不斷出籠、跌落甚鉅、與前日最高價較、一度曾見五十元高度差額、收盤時買多吸胃轉佳、最後成交價為二百三十六元、</p>
<p>國際上海揚子等股、受制於賣方壓力下、俱以一日中之最低價收盤、</p>
<p>中國墾植股雖亦被獲利了結之在飈所席捲、但其抵禦力較强、開盤由三十元跌至二十八元半、收盤又回上至二十九元、買氣甚佳、</p>
<p>橡皮股成交極鉅、雖紐約現貨趨低、價猶漲多於跌、橡皮信託·蘭格志·康沙來特·特形普及、橡皮信託一度創見十五元新高價、</p>
<p>證券暗盤、昨景况依然未有起色、丙種曾三度見八元價、依然未能立定、不過跌風稍見安定、有趨盤旋狀况、在本週內恐仍不易看好、因以前之跌均係現貨流出而小、幷非完全屬於多頭了結、而銀根亳未鬆動、各戶交易亦忽進忽出、大都為臨時性質、或則互相掉換取彼捨此而巳、已如四十一號上午則進丙出丁、下午則進丙出甲、潤利於上午進，下午又復賣出、聯益於上午出、下午復又收回、餘則三十五號始終買進、天生號則始終賣出、餘則零星搶帽子交易而已、結果續小一角至四角、成交總數約計一百萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交新新公司股五十股、價為十一元倫敦二十二日（週一）電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市、略見疲落、匯豐銀行股各跌半鎊、價均為九十三鎊半、古拉客林傍橡皮股亦跌六便士、價為十八先令三便士、其錄不動、</p>
<p>倫教二十二日（週一）電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、仍吿平靜、上下檔各債券槪無變動、</p>
<h3>金融　外匯套利　曾達五分以上</h3>
<p>外滙暗市、現平期鬆、良因遠月投機家因掉期拔開、多頭續有出籠之故、華商掉期及套利者仍多、聞有利曾貼出美金三角一二五、合月息竟在五分以上、下午遠月美匯投機家、仍有吐塞、市况仍穩、掉期略為軋攏、交易不寂、</p>
<p>華商掉進下月期</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近漲三七五、遠升〇三一二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬法等各匯俱平、美對英長三七五、對滬大二分、對法升二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士一二五、美匯六元〇三一二五、較之隔昨晚收均平、期貨亦無榮辱、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉增二元二角五分、華商本月份多頭、轉入下月期者頗多、貼出美金二角半至二八一二五、均由外銀行貼進、投機商亦有前來套利、扒現塞出五月期、貼進美金仍祇二角半、（月息四分三釐）、時現美金華商售予有利價六元〇六二五、市况頗平、投機商先進美行五月期美金五元七一八七五　後復出予某行同月價五元七五、致現貨又曾硬至六元〇六二五可結、忽聞印商（棉花結款）洋行方扒遠月印匯價二十羅比六二五、美匯頓見止鬆轉平、聞有利進五月期五元七五、而出現貨六元〇六二五、貼出予印商洋行美金三角一二五、（月息達五分以上）午刻頗平、</p>
<p>英美胡鬆現平定</p>
<p>午後初開毫無生色、交易稀少、據聞華商吸入外行五月份美匯五元七一八七五、晚收稍見回鬆、結果現貨英金四便士一二五、美滙六元〇三一二五、四月份英金四便士〇九三七五、美滙六元、五月份英金三便士九二一八七五、美滙五元七一八七五、較上日現貨英美皆平、四月份英硬〇一五六二五、美鬆〇三一二五、五月份英美各長〇一五六二五、與〇三一二五、</p>
<p>香港滙價均放長</p>
<p>香港二十三日（週二）電、今晨滙市開盤穩定、英匯現貨均鬆〇三一二五、遠期不動、美匯現貨長〇六二五、申滙及日滙現貨均無變動、下午各滙概無上落、</p>
<p>天津英緊美鬆動</p>
<p>天津二十三日（週二）電、今晨滙市開盤、英滙現貨緊〇三一二五、美匯鬆〇三一二五、申滙升七角五分、一聯鈔」暗盤仍現一百〇二元五角、</p>
<h3>買氣銷沉　金市日非</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、依然萎落潛勢尙難回好、蓋滙市繼續趨鬆、而銀根奇緊尤屬重要拆息竟達四分之鉅、致影響不少散戶、浮多執貨求售、更聞外商銀行對黃金押款催贖急迫、目絕無權續承做之可能、無實力經鶯者、徒嘆奈何是於金市買氣日漸銷沉、價被撳後欲起時感非易全天交易約二千兩左右、</p>
<p>烚赤跌五十元弱</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開人心尙穩、首由銀號進金號二十兩、仍為五千七百七十元、較之前收無分榮辱、開後外滙略鬆、金號證券帮傾向吐出、而斯時某錢兌業費意亦濃、塞出有數、一時頭寸頓感充斥、步落三十五元、金號進銀號十兩、為五千七百三十五元、此後某證券帮轉賣為買、再加銀號帮繼續吸收頓回升十五元、證券帮進金號三十兩、為五千七百五十元、迨十一時光景賣風復起、一般浮多因收貨關係、先後斬結、且進者寥落無幾、步跌三十元、金號出銀號五十兩、為五干七百二十元、午刻賣風稍戢、遂拉起十元、證券帮進金號十兩、為五千七百三十元、將近收盤時、錢兌業又賣、再小五元、出銀號三十兩為五千七白二十五元作午收價、午後因浮多了結者重來撈入、開市即高五元、金號進錢兌業二十兩、爲五千七百三十元、嗣為證券帮銀號帮買入、再漲十元、錢兌業進銀號五十兩、為五千七百四十元、入後證券帮反進為出、散戶亦賣、遂轉向下、銀號互做二十兩、遜為五千七百二十元、繼而金號出銀號十兩為五千七百二十二元作晚收價、結果比上日續跌四十八元、全天五十元上落、</p>
<p>首飾金鎭日不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、鎭日不動、大同行依然懸五日八十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>現鈔最高做過　一百三十五元</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、由高轉低、每十元上午由一百二十元直做高達一百三十五元、本年度高峯、見高現鈔供給較殷、故見銳落至九十五元、近午復升至一百〇五元、下午續升至一百十元、比上日回小五元、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均仍掛二角、勿更云、</p>
<h3>日票跌風益熾</h3>
<p>昨日英美金鎊緊隨金價步落、英金票亦不乏供給、美金票趨勢尤軟、一度退至十六元三角三分、然外滙市面尙平、美金票何以一再趨跌、足證邇日銀根緊急、有貨者紛將手貨陸續傾脫、藉以換取法幣、而資週轉、香港票及安南斐律濱等票、均跟隨趨下、日金票供給愈旺、市價益感不支、晚市退爲一元二角七分、朝鮮票始則供塞不絕、一度退至九角九分四釐、嗣稍有需要、晚市回上至一元、惟比上日仍小一分、</p>
<h3>紗花　買氣瀰漫　棉紗漲風劇烈　其如實銷淸淡何</h3>
<p>平定盤旋兩日之紗市、昨則又告上升、且漲勢愈形劇烈、此因現貨乾枯、檯面緊俏，所以客帮實銷雖不旺、然人心熱烈尤甚也、實則某國紗價奇昂、五月份二十支紗價已到一千四百三四十元全現鈔、較本紗為高、於是二十支雙馬紗被其牽動上漲矣、</p>
<p>現鈔長開二十支雙馬廠單買氣瀰漫、人心殊堅、一開即出關價為一千四百零五元、外棧價為一千四百二十元、一霎間因買者紛紜、市價直步趨高至一千四百五十四元、廠單價為一千四百四十五元、收盤又見上升、查半日問成交統計一千九白十五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨漲五十四元、又棉紗今（二十四日）有一千二百七十五件、運往香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>同行　一、八一〇　香港一〇〇</p>
<p>厦鬥　五統計一、九一五</p>
<h3>廠辦轉活　原棉向榮</h3>
<p>本棉交易稍形起色、因紗價步步前進、致脣齒相依之原棉、隨之向榮、同時廠方漸見活動之象、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>大中集　二五五·〇〇　同行進　三〇〇包</p>
<p>火機花　二一三·〇〇　同行進　二〇〇包</p>
<p>三餘花　二三一·七五　同行進　八〇包</p>
<p>火車　二一一·五〇　同行進　二二五包</p>
<p>平果爾　一九七·五〇　同行進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>康加　二二四·二五　同行進　二〇〇件</p>
<p>來特　二九五·〇〇　同行進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>美種　二三四·〇〇　同行進　七〇件</p>
<p>大中集　二四五·〇〇　二四九·〇〇　二四六·〇〇　新裕進　四八〇包</p>
<p>奧姆拉　二三四·〇〇　同行進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>彭家浦　二五四·〇〇　申新進　一〇〇件</p>
<p>另訊外棉市、紐約棉花、昨晨他棉市殊為平靜、續後市况轉形活躍、及一部份空頭抵補、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起五至八磅音、印度連同預測漲起二羅此、埃及漲五六磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日校為靜寂、然售價却異常高昂、但銀根奇緊、廠方購意頗濃、同業却不願被殺價賣出、故交易靜寂、然一般意見、棉價一致看好也、茲將昨日棉市以美滙六元折合送廠價如下、</p>
<p>二十支　美米特林　二九五·五〇</p>
<p>二十支　又　下級一八四·九〇</p>
<p>三十二支　又　三一二·六〇</p>
<p>三十二支　又　下級三〇二·〇〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　三一五·五〇</p>
<p>四十二支　又　下級三〇六·〇〇</p>
<h3>疋頭　囤戶活躍　棉布繼漲增高</h3>
<p>國布　昨市始平繼昂、引起本街之需要、囤戶亦起活動、惟以銀根緊迫關係、一部份貨主亦願隨市脫卸、故晨市平平、嗣後以需要不斷、人心轉堅、價即步步提升、結果粗布細斜每疋漲五角至一元、粗布漲二角半至七角半、漂染布上漲五有參差、約在一元左右、本街成交各貨一千餘件、粵帮辦色布色斜漂布近二百件、浙閩帮辦漂染布細布粗布三百數十件、烟津帮辦藍布漂布府綢洋紗等一萬餘疋、</p>
<p>東布　以紗價續升、北帮動辦仍殷、本街同業及囤戶亦繼續搜　、故漲風又烈、龍頭細布現貨最高價到過四十六元七角半期貨四十八元七角半、收市稍回、現出為四十六元四角期貨四十八元五角、叫君子嗶嘰現盤一元四角三分半、下月份一元五角三分、期貨價距離雖遠、而買戶皆樂於吸收、足見市氣緊硬、銀根依然緊迫也、</p>
<p>出口　今（二十四）有棉布五百三十五件運往香港、又八十五件運往新加坡、</p>
<p>進口　昨有　布十八件由溫州來滬、</p>
<h3>糧食米市終歸平定　粳米到貨尙旺</h3>
<p>昨日米市全依市貨之多寡、銷路之冷熱、與夫懐貨者之願售與否為轉栘、故如一號陳西貢及碎尖米茶等貨、始終站住、餘則承前軟勢、均屬虛浮、早市銷塲旣細、更兼多所回籠、所以行情即貶半元、若火絞祗售四十四元半左右、二號西貢四十三元半、小絞四十二元半、心思作用者又都乘廉補進、行情一度回昂、見復原盤、然卒以缺乏實胃、即復傾跌、結果收盤各價仍較前市貶短半元左右也、</p>
<p>厚薄粳等國米、自來源疏通、日有所到後、人心本已不若襲者之堅、昨旣又有常州等粳及靑泗薄稻南港早晚稻等一千四五百包抵埠、滬存漸增、聞塲外暗盤寥落異常、價格落七八角至元許、無錫淸粳已為四十四元八角、四十四元半、常州淸粳四十四元、粉粳四十三元、蘇崑白粳亦祇四十三四元、靑泗特薄稻四十五元、中市者四十三四元、南港早晚稻四十二三元、次四十一元、糯米去路亦較轉懈、惟價盤獨廉、貨主未肯輕脫、因是市面雖軟、售價無甚變化、僅中决者見貶三五角、</p>
<p>洋米昨市再見盤軟、晨間開市後各路國米相繼搬到、而洋米定貨與香港來貨亦復源源不絕、浮戶散客以銀根之緊迫、均圖隨市晚手、獲利者亦急念求脫、因此各擋現米一致瀉跌、尤以小絞跌風較猛、一度降至四十二元半以內、旋以價跌動消、又高至四十三元、然午後復見趨落、回籠二號西貢四五月份上午尙開五十四元二角半及二角、下午最低小至五一四元、收市有浮空抵補又回好一角、統車　範期貨開二百五六十噸、現洋米五千包、</p>
<h3>粉麥交易冷靜</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日交易、因出口已被日力統制、零批亦以大氣漸熱、不肯多進、統市出廠家直接批出者、巳不足五千包、回籠貨一度扳俏後、昨囤戶進胃轉懈、價亦無形鬆濫、聞老車牌開價十三元七角五六分、比廠盤已別小數分、其他內地日廠粉等、均祇喊價、未有正式交易、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市交易亦淸、蓋以目下出口　滯、日廠父乏進取、雖有華廠零星指染、吃盤殊為重視、而　貨者尙圖掙扎、致雙方迭趨擯局、聞送廠貨續開二十元零八角半至六角半、</p>
<h3>油市　生豆油　回好一二元</h3>
<p>昨日生豆油市况、先承上日之疲勢、市氣不振、入後因黃豆依然向榮、加之簍豆油底積鬆動、且所到桶裝油內中含水過量、致發生糾紛、一時有貨不應市之感、人心乃乘機活動、花生油亦因之抬高一二元、但成交數不多、共祗做開膠州生油一百件、價洋市價欄、靑島生油九十桶、江北門莊生油一百聽、烟台生油五百聽、大連豆油二十桶、膠州豆油一百件、靑歧豆油一百件、烟歧豆油一百五十件、及大有廠豆油四百擔、</p>
<h3>糖市　車粗俱鬆</h3>
<p>昨糖市續鬆、公　壽盤、二四粗白現貨外　新貨六十四元四角至三角、小落三角、老貨六十四元零五分、計小三角半、太古車白B嘜西棧七十一元四角、小二角、老貨七十一元、下檔照退、H嘜車赤仍五十一元、荷赤現貨五十四元、計升二角半、轉口貨出漳刁靑二百四十包、價爲五十一元半、</p>

<h3>「特警隊」傳將成立徵稅問題難解決　所謂「已臻成熟」未許樂觀「歹土」何日平靜無中預料</h3>
<p>越界築路「特警隊」、自二月間工部局與偽方簽定「警務協定」以來、雖有即將實行之趨勢但遷延迄今、以雙方意見、尚未完全一致、仍毫無結果、迨至本月十八日、工部局總巡鮑恩氏始正式發表、謂「特警隊」由於最近三星期內宣告成立、且謂工部局方面與偽方、將分別遺派鮑恩·盧英·及五十嵐翠大佐為代表、於十九日下午、在虹口再度商談、但結果畢竟如何、則雙方均未尤發表、尚無下文、</p>
<p>迭次會談似將成熟</p>
<p>直至昨日、權威方面始透露「特敬、警隊」之組織可望迅予成立、且謂、雙方會談之經過、已至極和諧之程度、惟經濟問題一項、仍未能獲得圓滿解決之方法、此項消息傳出後、復由傳　菴予以證實、渠　、目前吾人雖仍未能斷言「特警隊」究於何日方可成立、但信此項問題、已臻成熟之地步、在最近期內、定可獲得結果、</p>
<p>人選組織已經內定</p>
<p>又據傳、「特警隊」或將於下月中旬成立、共中人選、仍按規定、由雙方遺派而互經同意、目前人選且已派定、惟官方認為尚未至發表之期、組織細目、亦已擬妥、惟尚須再度討論、經雙方認可、　可　實現、</p>
<p>捐稅爭執難以解決</p>
<p>目前尚未獲解決者、厥為捐稅問題、據傳偽方已要求工部局予以考慮、並從速解決、工部局之答覆、則僅謂此項問題、須俟新董事就職後、始可提付討論、捐稅問題為越界築路問題之焦點、據一般人士之觀察、工部局經濟狀況、目前並不穩固、越界築路之捐稅徴收問題、勢將為雙方所爭、且決非短期內所可成立諒解者、故事實上「特警隊」成立在即之說、前途周未許樂觀也、</p>
<p>罪惡淵藪勢將遷徒</p>
<p>字林西報云、貨實方面頃表示工部局與「上海市府」臨時協定、所規定設立之西區世世警宗局、可望於下月中旬成立、其詳則談判、進行尚屬順利、惟財政問題、尚待最後解決、新警署地址及新警隊長、均已選定、聞該區賭場與烟館屆時均將關閉、經營烟賭者曾竭力設法疏通、由已無效、故將於下月中旬停閉或他徒、至於新警區財政問題、據工部局方面表示須待新董事會決定、又上海泰晤士報云、日文大陸新報曾載西區特警隊將在五月中旬成立一訊、記者昨夜以此叩諸工部局警務處長包文少校、據稱並未知悉、亦不悉該隊將於何日成立、蓋成立日期、未曾決定、雙方刻仍在籌劃中、何時可準備就緒、尚未可知、</p>
<h3>上海郵局　處境困難</h3>
<p>聞乍配　赴　　曾有某種接觸</p>
<p>上海郵政局之環境、據大通社記者探悉、自南京方面所謂「新組織」成立後、已有愈益惡劣困難之勢、上海郵務長乍配林氏、日前赴寗、除視察南京區郵務外、與所謂「新組織郵政司」王薌侯者、頗有接觸、是種接觸、或許為維郵權之折衝、然已足昭示上海郵局處境之日艱矣、至該局郵務行政、則迄無變更、一切均秉承昆明郵政總局命令、遵照辦理、</p>
<h3>濬浦局　情形複雜</h3>
<p>被扣船隻靳不發還　日方僅為利已工作上海濬浦總局之恢復浚浦工作、據大通社記者探悉、距實際開始之日期極為遙遠、據海關某高級職員表示、該局被日方所扣之挖泥船及測量船、除極少數外、日方仍靳而未與、查上項船隻、日方自行派員在高橋楊樹浦等處、專為便於已方工作、即張華浜已毀壞之船廠、亦迄未交還、且該局自被迫改組後、日員勢力、凌駕華員及西員之上、質言之、華職員與西職員、僅係備員而已、外傳浚工將於五月初開始之說、據渠觀察、未必能成為事實、</p>
<h3>五一節將屆　工界準備紀念</h3>
<p>五月一日國際勞動紀念節、轉瞬即屆、棲市工界每逢是項節日、向有　人慶祝、茲以時值非常、目滬市環境特殊、故決定不採取鋪張形式、亦不舉行任何集會、惟為紀念勞動節、與世界工人共同表示慶祝起見、是日決一律循例休假一天、同時各業工會為發揚勞動　意義、決通飭所屬會員、効法國際工人奮　精神、與現時惡劣環境作誓死戰爭、並矢志擁護抗戰國策、爭取最後勝利、以求得中國工人之眞正解放與自由平等、又據大光社記者探悉、兩租界警務當局以五月紀念節日特多、故決定採取聯合戒備、以確保界內秩序、而維公衆安寗、</p>
<h3>工部局日董　田誠提出辭職　日方屬望岡本一策補缺　惟照章須由董事會推選</h3>
<p>本屆工部日董田誠、市經選出後、即傳渠有辭職之意、昨日已經同盟社東京電證實之、按最近數週田誠本人駐在東醫院、當十八日本屆工部局全體董事就職時、田誠亦未能出席、而本埠日方消息、即稱田誠無意就職、遺缺當由大選時相差田誠兩票而落選之日董</p>
<p>岡本一策　塡補、據昨日同盟社東京電稱、田誠屬意於岡本為日董、遂已自動辭職、因渠覺岡本乃外交人才、並為熟悉中國事情之專家也、渠並知岡本曾脫離外交界而為工部局董事之候選人云、藍以岡本舊為</p>
<p>駐星加坡　日本總領事也、岡本現任在華日本紡績同業公會理事、並為上屆工部局日董之一、此次局董改選之先、日方突推出候選人五名、並預事佈置、企圖五名完全中選、以破壞工部局英美日董五二二比例之成規、則岡本一策及塙雄太郎兩前任董事以及新選董事三名、均可包括在內、不意</p>
<p>選舉結果　日方企圖、完全失敗、仍保持其日董兩名之原狀、更出意外者、塙雄太郎雖獲重選、而岡本竟名落孫山、而於上海情形並不甚稔悉之「華中鐵道公司副董事長」、却以兩票之多、躋入董事之林、此在本埠日僑會對公共租界</p>
<p>關係緊張　之際、識者早料以渠之資格、難以安於位矣、惟按工部局董事會之規則、年度之中、董事名額、如有出缺、當由其他董事推選之、是以田誠辭職以後、亦當按例照辦、日方所稱、當以競選時以兩票之差而落選之岡本一策自動塡補、實係完全</p>

<p>外界傳聞</p>
<p>工部局衛生處鑒於外界對於某戲院傳染斑疹傷寒一層、　遙諑滋多、爰特聲明如下、查斑疹傷寒、其由於已經傳染者、傳至他人、其間係經蚤虱　嚙之故、而此類蚤虱、必係先與患有此症之人發生接觸、虱身染得病菌、然後轉輾傳染、故此症之傳染、必與　集此類蚤虱之人有直接接觸、而後發生、殆無疑義、蚤虱寄存人體、歴時不久、即行離去、而　集蚤虱之輩、不致為戲院中之座上客、</p>
<p>傳染機會</p>
<p>吾人在行路時與他人互碰、其招致傳病蚤虱之機會、實比在戲院中為多、基上種種、則謂戲院內有此類蚤虱之生存、純係山於前曾收容難民一說、殊不可靠、某戲院內之收容所、遠在上年五月間停辦、難民早經遷出、房屋經已翻建一新、並以衛生處派員查勘、並無蚤虱之發現、如謂院內有發生傳染斑疹傷寒情事、而歸咎於以前收容難民之故、實不可能、衛生處對於界內各戲院、仍隨時密切注意、查察有無虱虫之發生、</p>

<p>還金佳話</p>
<p>沐阿大者，以　　為生，每日出門甚早，緣須往南郭外販貨，挑入城中出賣也。初一日早，甫出門，見地上有一藍布小包，拾之甚重，因返身入屋。啟視之，則靑錢二百文，洋　十枚，沐與妻見之皆大喜，以為得此意外財，必有佳運，遂交相慶賀！沐忽思我以辛苦度日，所獲無多，一旦得此，固當喜不自勝，但未識失者何人，倘其如我，抑更不如我，將無性命憂耶，乃欲效還金之舉。妻以為旣非搶竊而來，是天賜予者，受之當亦無妨，何必柞以愚舉。沐謂天若眷顧，何事不可發財，乃必欲以此區區乎，遂決意歸失者。復思已若出門貿易，恐妻貪小利，見尋者至而不還奈何，因此不作買賣，候於門首。次日上午，一老翁踉蹌而至，眼眶包淚，左右顧盼，知是尋物者。沐故問曰：「老年人多時不會，往何處去，請進少坐。」翁以素不相識答之，仍欲過門不入。沐固强之，翁吿以待先往尋物，尋着後再來未遲。沭問所失何物，翁　以吿，並曰：「家在鄞江橋，媳死在床，此係向故女之親戚家處借來，其二百文為盤川也。」沭問有何記認；翁以藍手貼角上有黑綫雙錢為記，沐騐之果然，遂出其原物還之，翁涕淚交流，叩頭無算。且曰：「看汝亦是艱難景象，願分小半以酬。」沐立誓不受，翁乃再拜而去。此事得之貪販家，誠少見也。</p>

<h3>房租糾紛的重見</h3>
<p>— 前車</p>
<p>公共租界的加捐，难然各界懇切陳辭，卻終於在納稅大會中通過了。記得在上月本刋上讀到一篇工部局宣佈加捐後的小報告，內容是：在離七月一日還有三個多月的時候，二房東已經未雨綱繆，把房租抬高了。於是作者下了－個結論，如果加娟通過，房租的斜紛，勢必增加（大意如此）。現在加捐是通過了，果然，第一件的房租糾紛在二十二日的本報上看到了，是：慕爾嗚路豐盛里全體房客反對義品放款銀行以斷水威脅墮迫加租啟事的廣告。雖然啟事中並未必到加捐事，但從「查貴行經租，祇有數月，即行加捐」等語看來，是多少和加捐有清聯繁關係的。同時，這一起料紛是見諸報章的，其他無數起的枓紛或許正在每個人的家中發生羞呢。</p>
<p>自從地租，水，　增加以後，大二房束以之為藉口，而數倍取之於三房容的，在過去的報上，所有的文字如果彙聚起來，未必會遜於一本巨著的。現在道百分之五十的加捐，在地主及．房東方面自然父有文章可做了。</p>
<p>據上惆月的調查，本市人口已從五百萬降全同百萬了，各處的召租字條也確乎多了，可見有許多。巳經榨不出油水而逃走了！（是回到他們淪陷了的故鄉去的嗎？）假使再加榨墜下去，再從四百萬下降是勢所必然的。姑不問他們是回到淪陷區去，或者上吊餓死，房子要空起來總是事實，那時二虜東的「藉口」不能向大房東訴苦，大房東自然也她付空捐了，所以，加要坦白地增加，分要公平的分配。同舟共濟才能達到勝利的彼岸。希望不要忽略這句老生常談。</p>
<h3>店主·職員·顧客</h3>
<p>— 于壁</p>
<p>三方面的利益在此一舉</p>
<p>詞了十五日本刊權君的短文後，弘起了我深深的感想。我起初以為他們「搭架子」，心中時常忿忿；但自從進了某公司任職以後，我才明白那些店員面孔常似「鐵板道人」的緣故了。原來他們都是從學徒出身的，做了十年八年，薪水還祇二三十元左右，膳宿不供。「陽春麵」三字，常掛在他們口頭；睡呢，有的在店堂裏早起晚鋪，有的捱在親友家裏，節衣縮食，才能勉強打發日子，心境自然不好了。心境不好，影饗到對顧客應有的一份禮貌也欠缺了。</p>
<p>賢明的老闆們，你如果要謀營業的蒸蒸日上，固然不能不注煮店員對於顧客的禮貌，但如果待遇改善，使他們能安心樂業，他們也會自動地注意對終顧客的禮貌的。怎樣使他們安心樂業？辦法約述如卜</p>
<p>（一）供給店員住宿，並須有固定的塲所。</p>
<p>（二）供給全膳，不要只供中膳，或完全不供。</p>
<p>（三）月薪應談以除去膳宿計算。</p>
<p>（四）每三個月家四個月，將生活指數計算一次，酌加津貼。</p>
<p>（五）年終店方如有盈餘，應視所賺數目多寡，斟酌情形，發給花紅若十月。有服務成績老變，成績優良的，應給予獎勵金。</p>
<p>（七）店員應有淮修及享受正常娛樂的機會。入校進修或參加純正業　團體，店方應酌貼全部或一部學費或會費。</p>
<p>（八）店鑄崗家庭負擔的，應有特別補救辦法。</p>
<p>以上不過就管見所及，拉雜寫來。賢明的考　們，如能把這些辦總一一做到，或大部解徐，則店員們精神物質旣不感痛苦，於是覺得店方的營業發逹與否，與自己息息相關，自然會對業務專心，對顧客有禮貌起來了。</p>
<p>賢明的老闆們，請你們眼光放遠一些吧。</p>
<h3>蛋黃容易消化</h3>
<p>汪于岡醫師來函</p>
<p>（上略）平常人對于吃蛋的觀念，總說是蛋自容易消化而且滋補，蛋黃悶氣並不滋補，所以即如可以吃蛋的病人往往吃蛋白加棄蛋黃，這在學理和事實上，竟成了個相反作用。照化學上的分析，蛋黃中除純蛋白質外，含有硫，脂肪，礦質牌複雜化合物（市上流行的蚤黃素者從此中提川），較之純蛋白質，在營養上價值既大，消化亦易，所以從科學原理的豁學，對於可以用蛋來營養的病人都接聯把蛋白棄去，祇拿蛋黃來給他吃。對於病人尚且如此，那麼蛋黃對於健康人的營養價值，尤其是有益了　。</p>
<h3>當心被騙送達費</h3>
<p>— 藩</p>
<p>戰近編錢的勾當差不多各樣都有，就是連法院中的訴訟文件送達費，竟亦有人會偽製來騙錢，因將我家中被騙的情形紀述出來，庶沒有被騙的人們，可以預防。</p>
<p>星期六的下午一時許，來了一個挾公事包的所謂「執達農」，進鬥便詢這裏是某某號嗎？某人在此否？他接著便從包中拿出一疊法院中的傳票等文件，取出一張請：法院中命送釆，送達費共六角，二角為車費，四角烏交給法院中。家中人見他泥法院中的人，父言語懇實，服飾整潔，家人當然不疑有假，就付給他，他拿後說聲某日早些等在法院中，不要誤時，再會一聲，楊長而去。</p>
<p>晚上鄙人回家，一睹這張如傳票式的紙張，就不對，因該紙脹為一隨便寫上幾句，既無院方鈐印，又無推事書記官名字印章，下方祇寫著執逹員章四字，亦不具名，祇上最堪注目的便是從其他文件上剪卜的「執達晨送達費」及「上海第一特區地方然院」字樣，所訂日期在日曆上一查為星期日，且鄙人該案早已於去年七月中結束，自思院方無再究必要；從有再詢，未必就一印章都沒有，這並不是偽造的嗎？但是所書案號姓名，確與鄙人的相同，所以我懷疑這是熟悉內中情形的人所為。</p>
<p>我把經過的情形寫出來，給一般未受騙的人們來一下預防，不致再白白出一筆無名的損失，一面使他不敢再嘗試。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第廿三回　舊侶新儔文章有價名區勝地管領得入</p>
<p>因為現在是用的為用更　，而照相術也吏加進步。近來不流行用大型照相器，卻只流行用那種小型照相器。小型照相器′，取其輕便司帶，摺疊了可以安敖在衣袋裏。為了鏡頭既好，稱造亦精，所以雖是極織小的，放大了亦絲毫無爽。甚而至於說有的把照相機裝在大衣裏子裏，或者西服褲帶上，只要把外面的衣服一翻開，把手指一撥動，便給人照了相去。那除非是當偵探的人，繼要乘人之不備，給人照相咧。不然，照相也得經本人同意，道是社會上一種禮貌。不過照相也未有不同意的，在現代照相已經等於家常茶飯了。尤其是報紙上，圖畫與文字並重，翻開一張報紙來，倘然一點插圖也沒有，那便索然無興味了。所以凡是當外勤記者的，都有極精緻的照相機。有戰館裹繼備的，也有屬於外勤記者自己的，就像邵慧華，她的照相器具，也有好幾架咧。報館裏還有一種特別的事，就是所謂電送照相。他有一種手提輕便電送機，凡記者出門，帶了那種手提電送機，只要她在一千公里之內，有電報之處，便可將這手提電放機打開，接通於電報綫之上，送到本報館來，你想這她何等便利。而報館收到了他們所發餉照相，便可以立刻製版，就映出在報紙上了。如今且說那位女技師，與她們照了一個相後，邵慧華便道：『澹雲姊應特別照一相，因為你是新嫁娘。」金澹雲有些不服氣，說：「為什麼我要特別照一相，你還是那種封建思想。」瞿無雙出來調停道：「不但是澹雲姊，幾位姊姊，大家特別照一相。愛人姊是我們女界中醫師明星，她盡力於助產育嬰事業，我們是很崇敬她的，應待別留二相。何家兩位姊姊，都是最前進的紡織工業家，你們尤其要多照兩張照華。我主張你們先合照一張，然後再分照兩相。因為你們實在太相像了，不是你們兩人穿兩樣顏色的衣服，實在敎人弄不清楚。合照在一張上，我們看看竟有這穢相同的姊妹。分照在兩張上，因為無論如何相像，總有一點點稍為相異之點。我們就要細細的縱出相異之點，卻在那裏。」（二六七）</p>
<h3>做上帝的兒子　（三）</h3>
<p>與耶穌的人格和精神接觸呢，也能使我們得著這樣的的鼓勵和權能，不過，不同的在耶穌給我們表示幾天命的價值，不在以往怎樣，也不在現今怎樣，乃在將來無限的成就。所以我們的腦海中，一時充滿高貴的思想，夢幻，和計劃，還是不夠。一時奮發等求精神上的進步，這為一事。天天繼續不檞向前求进步又為一事，基督敎的賞質，在使人有熱心有播能做上帝有兒子，天天儘能力機會所許可，做上帝的器血，改造這個世界。所以，我們要自問，我們現在腦海中有的是什麽？天天向着什麽努力？人生有價值目標何在？耶穌是上帝的兒子，但他也是模範。耶穌的精神，我們也可以有。這是我們相的。為此，我們要打開心門接受他的精神。人人可做上帝的兒子。若我們都如上帝的兒子一般做人，世界當又是如何景象？我們要從將來的造就去估量人，人做工，不是為自己有所得，乃是為工作將來的發展計。人的生命價值，不在他以往的出身，也不在他現有的財富，乃在他出於自己創作和意志力所得將來的發展，這是做人的基要目標。「有限」二天，在人裏面不應當有，有的只是堅強的意志，和不斷的努力。社會飽和了這樣的動機，纔有新的文化可觀。兩千年來，各處各色的人，來到耶穌面前，得了做上帝兒女的權能。我們如他們一般，當向上向前，百折不回。我們當有勇敢，向前去獲得和平及個人的權能。我們只要甘願做這偉大十字軍工作，作，我們的品格，使可以得電充分的發展，與無限的長進。完</p>

<h3>好萊塢的新作風</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>好萊塢影評家對這一年度　流露着「神秘年」的口號。據美容界權威范克脫的推測，去年紅極一時的「唔女郎」作風，今年將趨於落伍，無人顧問，影迷們不再崇尙「性感」而將歡迎一種自然的新鮮氣象，兼帶有神秘的作風。這在「一九四　年的美國小姐」一片中，將充分的演出。</p>
<p>今年度有許多退隱一時的明星，都要捲土重來。呼聲最高的是笑匠卓別林，他今年有二部以上新片公映，以他廣博的諷刺與笑容，將重復被推爲銀台第一藝術家。其次葛萊泰嘉寶和瑪琳黛德麗，她們可會有非常的活躍。</p>
<p>在這個神秘年中，四位以風流目賞的小生，無疑將有劇烈的竸爭。克拉蓋博爾爲保持「第一賣座紀錄」，必將與泰羅鮑華相火併。勞　泰勒去年連拍三片，賣座奇劣，今年不得不叫他釀成一種新的作風。而却爾斯鮑育在一度返法國入伍，近又重回好萊塢，女性們對他的英勇，必期待一種新的刺激。</p>
<p>在諸女星之中，去年榮膺后座的蓓蒂台維絲，她仍將保持不衰的紀錄。至於那些童星們，如秀蘭鄧波兒，狄安娜窦萍，葛洛麗琴，米蓋維納，他們雖未必能創造一種特殊風格，但他們的活潑與清麗，必和卓別林和嘉寶一般的令人興奮。</p>
<h3>琴師技藝雜談</h3>
<p>— 渴雲樓主</p>
<p>徐蘭沅　—發調清越，理路正確，其與王少卿創始梅派琴　，風靡一時，所奏之曲，在表面似覺平凡，但操持頗嚴，始終不懈，非有久長涵養，難於着手。在「生死恨」一片中，隨浣華曼妙之歌喉，一起一落，在收腔放眼之際，別具一格，匠心獨裁，耐人動聽，有悠然神往之感。惟每喜在「工—尺」之間，故意拉長調門，以炫其能，乃美中不足耳。</p>
<p>穆銕芬　—腕力卓絕，指音剛朮，可抗諸佐臣彥衡，其琴風操持之奇，十數年來未甞稍變，偶以適合時好，在佐玉霜灌「荒山淚」一片中，稍逞其「化」，亦板眼俱全，「小過門」拍拍拉出，近仍一貫作風，絕不稍涉花巧，以趨時俗，今人欽服莫名。此次獻藝，愚蓮聆十數塲，覺其音過涉底，不能鋒芒一試。按彼琴調，最宜「乙」字，今以遏雲之故，不能如願矣；且處處隨腔而走，不得暢所欲爲，每在奏「大過門」時，稍顯身手；極爲有限，偶在本戲中，一聆清奏之「哭皇天等曲，亦不過一霎那之間。襄昔高吭之調，裂帛之韻，獨付闕如，不禁憮然也。</p>
<p>楊寶忠　—寶忠亦係半途出家，與鴻壽相同，鬚生琴中獨具卓絕之指音，可推祭酒。其佐溫如，操絃乃趨於「化」似失向來練琴之本旨，蓋彼歷宗元老者也。溫如則運腔機巧，輒無定處，而寶忠亂中趨靜，在要琴「化」中，不失其正，頗其高琴之格式，（言三之琴，即學其亂，不得其正，形貌雖同，難聽極矣）故研習其琴風，非適宜於溫和，今果以拆夥聞。但返佐其弟寶森，亦難相合，蓋唱奏不同，烏能臻茲佳境哉。</p>
<p>陳鴻壽　—鴻壽本習鬚生，倒嗓後乃以琴佐王少樓，少樓吃調底瘖，而鴻壽能在侷促之調門中，炫奇逞能；且板眼清楚，一絲苟，音韻幽揚，頗顯其托腔之玄妙，能聽出，少樓唱片調近「爬」字，而能普遍歡迎，南北暢銷，此不在其唱之直能號召，而在人易於學習耳。而鴻壽之藝，固亦佔其半焉。</p>
<h3>影星們向　影迷所下的忠告</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>瑪琳奧莎莉文　「你們不要以爲上銀幕是一件輕而易舉的事情；一個沒有學識的演員，是會到處受着他人的非笑的；而要在上銀幕前，有一番精細的準備，那是更屬緊要的條件。」</p>
<p>寶蓮高黛　「你們對於我們演員所抱的態度，應該是一種善意的愛護；無義的騷擾則不可；否則我們的工作準會受到莫大的影響。我因爲不喜歡多和外界接觸，因此你們就給我帶上了一個什麼「神秘女郎」的雅號，這種現象，完全是輕視了我的人格。」</p>
<p>桃樂珊拉摩　「在你們的目光下，一定認爲明星們的生活總是極盡富麗舒適的能事的；這個觀念是完全錯誤的。我在未入電影界前，曾在紐約某公司當過一個開電梯者，那時候的生活，常人真是不能忍受的。所以到了現在，收入雖足够我來享受舒適的生活，但是想起了常年的狀况，不免又会感到寒酸了。」</p>
<p>里昂巴里摩亞　「我現在已是人老珠黃了，但我在銀幕上連早年在舞台上所度的生涯，差不多是近六十年了。從我的經驗我知道對於一位青年藝人，要希望他能不斷上進，最重要的是多方面給他一種正確的批評。如果觀眾們衹知無鵠的來稱讚或是條忽的擁戴，那就無異讓他跴入了敗墮之途」</p>
<p>珍妮蓋諾　「影迷們有一個共同的目標，就是希望對於一般已有崇高地位或者是演技精湛的明星，他（她）們的出品能够愈佳，這是不能做到的，因爲有一個原因：一，他（她）們的精力與平人一般有限。二，就爲了他（她）們已有了崇高的地位或者是精湛的演技，所以對於他（她）們自己的每一部出品，不能再敷衍從事，而把名譽毀壞。這樣，攝制時所費的時間與一般普通的當然不能比，所以亦就不能有多量的出品。」</p>
<h3>「英烈傳」主角李麗華小姐，精擅平劇，圖爲化妝時之精神。</h3>
<p>— 焦超攝</p>
<h3>李紅的春裝</h3>
<p>— 一龍攝</p>
<h3>周劍雲識拔新人</h3>
<p>— 亦星</p>
<p>周劍雲君創立新公司一節，至今已趨具體化，然而導演演員，却是相當嚴重的問題，不久以前，有人推薦金素琴給周氏主演「文姬歸漢」，是否成局，目下尙不可知，而周氏於大鐘劇社公演「桃花源」劇中，却發現了一位名喚喬喬的小姑娘，年方一十五歲，從小生長北平，國語自然流和無比，而演戲更有天才，唱起歌來，嗓子也甜潤悅耳。據記者所知，喬喬原名王翹鈺，現就讀於清心女中，因爲愛好戲劇，所以偶而客串一次，至於拍戲一節，不知她家庭能否尤許？</p>
<p>上海伶界聯合會主席陳月樓，最近經幾位代表的奔走，再三勸慰，以伶聯會大局爲重，他這禮答應勉爲其難，不過在復職以前，有一個條件，是必須共同努力收回梨園坊的房屋和地產。</p>
<h3>英國影壇的示威作</h3>
<p>— 靜遠</p>
<p>最近，英國政府攝制完成了二張示威作：</p>
<p>一張是：「太平洋危機」（“Crisis　in　the　Pacific”），把日本在遠東的政策，香港新嘉坡的防衛，以及美國太平洋前哨甘姆（Guam）軍港的海軍威力等，一一搬上銀幕，且由前美國亞洲艦隊總司令雅納爾上將叙述中國戰事最近實况，而關於中國將士英勇作戰的情形，亦有相當描寫，全片材料全完是剪接自新聞片而加以最縝密複雜的編製手續始告完成的。</p>
<p>還有一張是：「海軍史賞」（Cavalcade　of　the　Navy）；把海軍的歷史和進展過程詳述無遺，全片開始於古代腓尼基和羅馬的海軍狀况，一直叙述到目前的英國海軍爲止。最後是把大不列顛海軍的龐大陣容展開在銀幕上。其攝制目的，一方面固然是給自己國人作進一步的認識，另一方面當然也是爲了要向敵國示威而拍攝的！</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Serious Message to Mr. Abe Nobuyuki</h3>
<p>Abe Nobuyuki, a Japanese general of the army, first class of merit, former Prime Minister, recently arrived in the Chinese occupied territories with the title of Ambassador. Since he entered the port of Wusong at dawn on the 21st of this month, there has been no official announcement from Japan, no lively welcome in Shanghai and Nanjing, and no clear and definitive report from their propaganda organizations; some say that he is still staying in Shanghai, while others say that he has already gone to Nanjing, but no one knows for sure: in short, his movements are somewhat obscure. Originally, Mr. Abe could be said to have been both a general and a prime minister in his own country, holding the highest position, enjoying wealth and honor, and looking down on the court and the countryside, truly everyone watched him closely and bowed their heads; but the Shanghai and Nanjing area, although within the occupied area, is only because people are thinking of the Han, and can't help but be alarmed at every step, then the "Ambassador" comes and goes, also has its reasons for not being too public, not being too extravagant; it should not be that at the time when his "Ambassador" and "Special Envoy" titles are difficult to match the reality, he is regarded as a "Secret Envoy" because he does not understand his movements!</p>
<p>Although Mr. Abe's movements are yet to be examined, his visit to China is real; although his titles are strange, his mission is real; although China and foreign countries do not pay much attention to him, his subjective grand aspirations and heavy responsibilities are real. Because of this, all those who love China, cherish Japan, care about the future of the Far East and the welfare of human civilization, no matter how deeply they hate aggression, they must inevitably feel something for Abe and can not remain silent. Because all mistakes must eventually be corrected, the deeper the mistake, the more the legacy, the greater the harm, and the more the correction requires a wider and longer space of time; this is all unnecessary waste, and has its corresponding tragedy and sin; but it is better to correct it now than to try to correct it later. The correction of mistakes is an inevitable result, is a conclusion of the Kingly Way. Mr. Abe is a learned man, he will be able to recognize that the so-called law of cause and effect and the conclusion of the Kingly Way are by no means pedantic words; he will at least be able to examine the 2,600 years of Japanese history to prove that mistakes have no lasting and stable success, so as to disprove the non-pedantic corruption of the law of cause and effect and the Kingly Way.</p>
<p>It would be too burdensome to trace all the mistakes Japan has made towards China from now on; moreover, there are also a large number of things that the Japanese can never be convinced of and willingly admit as mistakes, so it is not necessary to trace them one by one. But there is one basic point that the Japanese must recognize as a mistake, that is, to estimate the mistake. The artillery fire and bombs that Japan has inflicted on China have widely and deeply awakened national consciousness, invigorated national spirit, and ignited national flames; from this, it has evolved into a unified organization, a strong resistance, and a great new life; from then on, it will be unyielding and indelible. This is what Japan failed to estimate, and it has become the main pivot of all mistakes. The Japanese only use a chaotic history of China, from ancient times to modern times, to the first twenty years of the Republic of China, as the only data for estimating China; they neglected that national consciousness is a latent, innate instinct, they neglected that the right to national survival is a pressing demand of descendants, and they neglected the standing of national leaders. History will not mechanically repeat itself, the vigorous situation in China today, from the leader to the common people, is indeed unprecedented in Chinese history; the thorny issue encountered by those who have invaded China since ancient times is also unprecedented in Chinese history; at the same time, the Chinese people also deeply understand that if China were to face modern extinction, its tragedy would also be unprecedented in the history of China's repeated submission to foreign races. Therefore, the total cause can be extended to all aspects; and among them, it is particularly worthy of Mr. Abe's reference. On a small scale, it must be known that the Chinese people will never regard this war of resistance as a political struggle, but thoroughly recognize it as a national war; on a large scale, it must be known that China will never surrender, and must fulfill its grand wish for national independence and integrity.</p>
<p>The Japanese sometimes seem clumsy; not to mention the distant ones; as for the recent Dutch East Indies issue, it is clear that the United States, Britain, and other countries will advocate maintaining the status quo for the sake of their own vital interests on behalf of the Netherlands, but the Japanese diplomatic authorities are still making boring probes and have provoked some unseemly reactions; again, as for the naval quality issue, it is clear that the United States, Britain, and other countries are determined to maintain the 5-5-3 ratio, but because Japan attempted to break through this 60 percent, it has caused a "can't afford" shipbuilding competition; again, as for the Soviet Union's skill and knowledge in international politics, Japan ignores everything and unilaterally publicizes that the Soviet Union is seeking a compromise with Japan, which is clearly only for cafe chatter and is not enough to deceive the diplomats of various countries. As expected, it has prompted the Soviet side to resolutely publish its ruthless denial. All of these things may not be clumsy, but only loyal and using all means; calm and fair commentators are even unwilling to judge the Japanese as clumsy. Therefore, the Japanese, while trying their political strategy towards China, are still trying to maintain their military points and lines; while looking forward to using war to support war, they still have to formulate a huge wartime budget; while declaring support for the Nanjing organization, they still do not hesitate to say that they have no hope of resolving the so-called incident and realizing the so-called peace. When Mr. Abe was saying goodbye to Tokyo, even the Japanese propaganda organizations did not say anything about his grand vision, which shows that Mr. Abe is not clumsy.</p>
<p>Then, what will Mr. Abe use to report back when he leaves? The clumsiest thing to do is to deceive himself and others, to follow some diplomatic path, to do some diplomatic procedures, to talk about what to argue for and what to concede, and to think about what to agree to and sign to complete his so-called accomplished facts? To be honest, if the total strength of Japan is enough to cope with the international environment and maintain its policy of aggression, if the Japanese army invading China can cope with China's final counterattack for a long time, then why should they sign a treaty; otherwise, even if they sign a treaty, who will admit that it is valid! An invalid agreement and signing will not make Japan get more and China lose more, but will increase an unnecessary concern for Japan in the future when correcting mistakes, and reduce the courage and opportunity to correct mistakes as soon as possible. Some say: Japan will express Japan's concession to the status quo by Mr. Abe's signing of the treaty. Let us not ask whether this statement is credible or not, and even more unnecessary to ask about the so-called degree of concession; China originally has nothing to ask for, but only wants the complete independence and integrity of the country without any discount. If Mr. Abe does not deceive himself and others, if Mr. Abe has the ambition and skill of a great statesman, then what he uses to report back is definitely not a waste of paper, but only to fulfill his loyalty, to advocate the immediate recall of the army, to fundamentally abandon the policy of aggression against China, and to work with an independent and complete China for the stability and welfare of the Far East. The Chinese people value the Kingly Way most, and are not clumsy, so they are both looking forward to Japan's reversal of its plans and sharpening their resistance.</p>

<p>Chongqing: Regarding the rumors that the Chinese Communist Party had made demands to the government through Ms. Soong Ching Ling, Reuters has learned from responsible sources that Ms. Soong clearly declared that she was not interested in the Chinese Communist Party after arriving in Chongqing. It is said that the rumors that the Communist Party demanded the dismissal of He Yingqin, Kong Xiangxi, and Chen Lifu are completely unfounded.

<p>Tongguan: Since the Chinese forces in southern Shanxi recaptured Yandi, Huai Shuxia, and the strongholds west of it on the 20th, the Japanese reinforcements counterattacked, but were repelled by the Chinese forces.

The Japanese forces collapsed and fled towards the Yu Temple direction and were again ambushed by the Chinese forces, suffering extraordinarily heavy casualties. Another unit attacked Lian Cun at 5 a.m. on the same day. Currently, the Chinese forces are gradually pressing towards the Japanese troops. The Japanese troops are collapsing on the entire front and the Chinese forces who have been maneuvering behind them have now reached a certain area, cutting off the Japanese retreat. The Japanese troops who invaded southward will not be difficult to completely annihilate in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Furthermore, it is reported that over four thousand Japanese troops, who have been repeatedly reinforced to invade and occupy the ShangXia Bao and Guo Jia Zhuang areas east of the Zhang Mao Avenue, were again ambushed in cooperation by the Chinese forces according to a pre-arranged plan on the night of the 20th, launching a brave assault. The fighting continued until dawn on the 21st, and the Japanese suffered more than half of the casualties. The entire army collapsed, and the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to fiercely pursue and annihilate the enemy along the line of JiWangGuWang and DongXiYan Village, and advanced from west of MaoJia Mountain into the DaKuan Village area on ZhangMao Avenue. It is also reported that the Japanese troops who have been heavily annihilated by the Chinese troops in the area east of Zhongcun Town and Zhangma Town have been repeatedly reinforced and cooperated with multiple aircraft to wantonly harass. On the night of the 20th and at dawn on the 21st, they continued to launch fierce attacks on the entire front of the Chinese army. The battle situation was extremely fierce. The loyal and brave Chinese soldiers breathed in the mountains and rivers and vigorously beheaded the enemy, fighting more and more bravely. The Japanese corpses piled up in the mountains and fields, and their will to fight disappeared. Under the fierce fire net of the Chinese army, they rolled and dodged. At the same time, a certain unit of the Chinese army occupied the line of Hong Gou He Dong Gou Men, completely sweeping away the Japanese positions. The Japanese troops fled in all directions, and the Chinese troops are taking advantage of the victory to mop up the enemy.

The fierce fighting continued until dawn on the 18th, and the Japanese troops collapsed and retreated towards DaChen Village. The Chinese army then completely recaptured Ba Zheng Village, Sheng Ren Jian Zhai Tou, Maojin, and other places. Soon, Japanese reinforcements of two to three thousand troops launched a counterattack in four directions, and their momentum was fierce. They engaged in a bloody battle with the Chinese troops on the line from Zhongcun GuWang XiYan DongYan to the Yellow River. The Japanese troops took advantage of the artillery cover to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese troops. The Chinese officers and soldiers disregarded their own safety, advancing wave after wave, attacking back and forth. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. After a day of fighting, the stubborn Japanese troops in each direction were defeated by the Chinese forces. A total of 2,000 Japanese troops were killed in one day, and a Japanese bomber was shot down near GuWang. The plane was destroyed and the people were killed.

<h3>American Rear Admiral Taussig Points Out the Crisis of War Between the United States and Japan; Advocates Close Cooperation with Britain, France, and the Netherlands; Strengthen Defenses of the Philippines and Guam</h3>
<p>Washington: Rear Admiral Taussig, commander of the Fifth Naval District, told the Senate Naval Affairs Committee yesterday that he believed a war between the United States and Japan was inevitable. Japan was seeking to dominate the Far East and intended to conquer the Philippines, French Indochina, and the Dutch East Indies. The "Tanaka Memorial" of 1927 included a plan to conquer the world, and this plan began with the intention to "overthrow the United States..." "For the sake of the future of the Far East, we should take economic and financial measures to maintain the integrity of China... Japan is a stubborn and bellicose nation whose promises are worthless." Rear Admiral Taussig further stated that the only hope for the United States was to build an invincible navy so that Japan would not dare to challenge it. Strong defenses should also be established in the Philippines and Guam, creating major trade routes, and cooperating with Britain and France to maintain the status quo in the Far East. Rear Admiral Taussig also stated that if Germany won in the current European war, then we would "suffer the oppression of totalitarian states." Senator Rogers asked whether the United States should join other powers in fighting Japan to maintain the integrity of China. Rear Admiral Taussig replied, "We are a signatory to maintain the integrity of China." (United Press dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations Rear Admiral Taussig recently delivered a speech to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, stating in brief: (1) Our national interests are clearly threatened by the situation in the Far East. We need a stable and independent China. As a result of the evolution of the situation in the Far East according to the current trend, I really do not know how the United States can avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. Therefore, we must take action so that we will not be forced to duel with Japan in the future." (2) I propose that Britain, France, and the Netherlands should assist the United States and negotiate with the United States to allow the United States to use their bases in the Pacific. If a conflict were to occur between Japan and the United States, it would inevitably be a naval battle. Our country cannot advance on Japan, and Japan cannot invade our country, but it can be asserted that Japan will attempt to invade the Philippines. For this reason, I believe that the United States must, on the one hand, build an "indestructible" naval base in the Philippine Islands and, on the other hand, continue to build battleships without interruption. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>New York: After Rear Admiral Taussig, former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations of the United States, submitted a report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee yesterday, there was much speculation from the outside world. Therefore, he issued a statement today, stating that his report did not mean that war between the United States and Japan was imminent. He said, "Judging from the reports in some newspapers, my report yesterday seemed to indicate that a war between the United States and Japan was inevitable. In fact, I do not believe that such a war is imminent at all, and I do not want to be an alarmist. What I wanted to explain at the time was that, based on the current situation, a war will be triggered at some uncertain time in the future, but if we can make our country militarily prepared, this war can still be avoided, and our country can still maintain peace. In short, the sole purpose of my entire report to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was to find a way to keep us at peace forever." (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: When Rear Admiral Taussig, former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, delivered a speech to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, he believed that war between the United States and Japan was inevitable. Secretary of State Hull recently told reporters that the government's foreign policy was very clear. What Taussig talked about was obviously his personal opinion. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington: Regarding the speech delivered by Rear Admiral Taussig, former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, to the Senate Naval Affairs Committee, the Navy Department recently issued a public statement by Admiral Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, stating that what Taussig expressed was only his personal opinion and did not reflect the views or policies of the Navy Department, and that it was contrary to the views of the Navy Department. The precautionary measures he suggested were not directed at any country, but were purely based on prudent considerations, so that our country's naval power could maintain a proportion with the navies of other countries. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington: Political figures here have commented on the speech delivered by Rear Admiral Taussig, former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, that war between the United States and Japan is inevitable, saying that although this speech is a personal opinion of the rear admiral, its nature is extremely important and its significance is even more profound. His proposal that Britain, France, and the United States should cooperate with each other is a natural result of recent events. For example, there is the saying that Japan is building eight super battleships of 45,000 tons, two of which have been completed. This is one. Japan is expanding the scope of its current commercial treaty with a certain Latin American country, attempting to offset the influence of the United States in Latin America. This is two. Japan is demanding the right to continue to immigrate to the Philippine Islands. This is three. If the Netherlands is invaded by Germany, the fate of the Dutch East Indies will be shaken. This is four. From this point of view, Taussig's warning is not without reason. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Philippines Decides to Limit Japanese Immigration; Japanese Side Requests the United States to Intervene with the Philippines; Hull Indicates It is Inappropriate to Interfere</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull sent the Philippine immigration restriction proposal to Philippine President Quezon yesterday without adding any comments, implying that the Philippine government could "proceed" with this bill unless the Philippine government voluntarily made concessions to Japan. Washington's opinion is that this restriction does not discriminate against any country, so it is widely believed that President Roosevelt will not oppose it. Hull said that the Philippine government has its legal rights on such matters, and the United States will not interfere or exert pressure. When the Secretary of State also touched on the remarks made yesterday by Rear Admiral Taussig, commander of the Fifth Naval District, that a US-Japan war was inevitable, he said that Rear Admiral Taussig was only expressing his personal opinion, and the State Department's policy had been clarified previously. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi asked US Secretary of State Hull on Saturday and Sunday to intervene with the Philippines, which is planning to legislate to limit the number of Japanese entering the country to 500 people per year. Hull stated today that the US government does not want to impose its own opinions on the Philippine legislature on this matter, nor does it want to exert pressure. (Reuters dispatch of the 22nd)</p>

<p>Stockholm: British and German troops have each advanced fiercely towards the largest battlefield of this European war today. This large battlefield is located in the area between Hamar and Lillehammer. According to news from southern Sweden, the Germans are advancing their transport planes, soldiers, aircraft, and various war supplies towards southern Norway, while the Allied forces are also moving rapidly south and mobilizing other troops landing on the coast. The German troops are now intensifying their shelling of the areas around South Oslo, Dubes, and Lillehammer, attempting to prevent the Allied forces from communicating and destroying their lines, and replacing them with their own troops. According to witnesses, the port of South Oslo, where the first detachment of British troops landed, has been completely destroyed. However, the troops and equipment of the Allied forces are said to have already been transported inland. The roads and villages east and southeast of South Oslo were heavily bombed on Sunday by the air force from southern Norway. The important railway and road from Andalsnes to Hamar, and the branch road from Trondheim to Dombås, were also heavily bombed on Monday. The Allied forces are said to be mechanized and well-equipped, with light tanks, anti-aircraft guns, heavy artillery, and excellent flat-trajectory guns. It is also reported that an Allied force detachment that was attacked by German planes near Steinkjer has shot down five of the seven German planes that carried out the air raid. (United Press dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: According to local reports, a British troop train has arrived at Storlin, a railway junction 30 miles south of Trondheim. Fighting has now broken out in Veresolora, northeast of Trondheim. German planes have repeatedly bombed the highways and railways connecting South Oslo and Trondheim, but although telephone lines are said to be cut, the railway has not been severely damaged. In addition, Steinkjer, where several Norwegian troops are stationed, was heavily bombed by German planes and caught fire and is currently burning. After British planes bombed the airfields in the Trondheim area, the Germans felt it was more difficult to send planes for air raids. Although the Germans claimed that German troops had occupied Lillehammer, between Hamar and Dombås, the vanguard of 750 British troops has now arrived in that area, and more British troops are arriving one after another from Andalsnes. According to another report, the railway from Andalsnes and then to the Guobolangstai Valley is now entirely in the hands of the Allied forces. The railways and highways are guarded by heavy troops of the Allied forces, and the German attempt to cut off these routes by using paratroopers to land has failed. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: According to reliable sources, British troops are now launching fierce attacks on German troops along the coast of northern Norway. They have made considerable progress in the direction of the city of Stiekstad (40 miles northeast of Trondheim). It is reported that the German troops in the city of Stanger (20 miles north of Stiekstad) have been defeated and are retreating. It is also reported by well-informed sources that the British and French Allied forces, after landing at the port of South Oslo, are joining forces with the Norwegian army and pointing south, looking to take Trondheim port. Although German planes are constantly bombing and strafing with machine guns, the railway and various lines of communication leading to Trondheim are said to be controlled by the Allied forces. As for the Narvik port area, a major battle is about to begin. There are 1,000 German soldiers in that area, who have been surrounded. Although the areas near the Swedish border are in German hands, the surrounding areas are all Norwegian army units. In addition, according to semi-official sources, the strategic point of Langstel Bay in Norway is completely in the hands of the Allied forces, and British troops have advanced to the city of Lillehammer.

The German troops then occupied Gorvik after heavily damaging the Norwegian troops. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>German Planes Continuously Attack British Positions for Days, Targeting Railway Transportation for Destruction; Hydroelectric Plant in Northern Norway Has Been Destroyed</h3>
<p>London: The Berlin official communication agency described the situation of the air raid on South Oslo, saying that German planes bombed British positions for six hours. The German planes attacked continuously, and the number of casualties could not be accurately determined. The railway station has been destroyed. According to a communique released in London yesterday regarding the German air raid near South Oslo, the town of South Oslo was quite damaged, but the only loss on the Allied side was the sinking of a British fishing boat. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command announced this morning that our air force yesterday concentrated on bombing British landing troops near South Oslo and Andalsnes. The important railway junction of Dombås has been destroyed, and the stations of Andalsnes and South Oslo have been heavily damaged. Two British transport ships were bombed and sunk, and another was set on fire. British warships protecting the transport ships were also hit by bombs. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Grolong City: A Havas frontline correspondent recently telegraphed that German planes again bombed the highway from South Oslo to Grolong City and to the ports of Leversang and Trondheim this afternoon, with Grolong City being the main target. In addition, a train heading south of the city was also bombed. (Havas dispatch of the 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: Dr. Keller, a German war correspondent, described the German air force's bombing of Narvik and the destruction of the Trolmsø hydroelectric plant, which is 150 kilometers from the town. He said that German bombers took off from an airfield in southern Norway and moved north. The task assigned to the team was to bomb the Trolmsø hydroelectric plant. When the air force in the plane discovered the iron tower of the Trolmsø broadcasting station, they knew that the hydroelectric plant was not far away and continued to move forward, flying over high mountains and ridges. In the valley, they discovered a large building, which was the hydroelectric plant they were searching for. However, they immediately encountered ground machine gun fire. Our planes then dropped bombs, which exploded a few meters in front of the building. Our planes circled several times and then dropped bombs on the plant again. The machine room was hit, and the entire plant was damaged. Seconds later, yellowish-brown water rushed out, as the reservoir had also been hit and destroyed. The hydroelectric plant was rendered useless. At this point, the mission was completed, and the radio operator sent a wireless report to headquarters. After flying low for several circles, they flew back to their original defense. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Britain Strengthens Naval Power by Adding Five Main Ships; Displacement is Over 40,000 Tons; "Unsinkable Ship" Ideal is Approaching</h3>
<p>London: Mr. Pewart, a naval defense expert for the "News Chronicle," stated that the British Navy will soon increase its most powerful warships in the world by five ships. Their names have been determined as "George V," "Prince of Wales," "Duke of York," "Jericho," and "Petty," and they are currently undergoing testing. These five ships are the largest warships that Britain has ever built. Only the "Lion," "Dauntless," and two other unnamed ships currently under construction have forms that exceed them. The displacement of these four ships will be at least 40,000 tons each. The various equipment of the five "George V" ships are different from those of the British old warships. Each is equipped with ten 14-inch main guns, sixteen 5.5-inch guns, and many light guns. Each ship carries three aircraft and 1,500 officers and soldiers. Although "unsinkable" warships are still an ideal, the "George V" may be closer to this concept than any previous ship. The percentage of weight used for underwater defense against torpedoes has greatly increased. If the armor installed on the sides and deck of the ship is included, its total weight accounts for 40 percent of the total displacement of 35,000 tons of the entire ship, which is a new world record. The speed exceeds 30 knots per hour, and the endurance has also greatly increased. The firepower and range of its 14-inch guns exceed those of the old ships' 15-inch guns and can penetrate thicker armor. The above five ships have been completed and launched early, and the British Navy's main battle force will increase to 19 ships, with at least four more under construction.

<h3>British Aircraft Continue to Fly Over Denmark and Norway to Bomb German Air Force Bases; Aalborg Implements Curfew</h3>
<p>London: The Ministry of Aviation recently announced, "Our planes flew over Norway and Denmark again last night" to attack enemy air force bases. Bombs were dropped on two airfields near Oslo, and many incendiary bombs were dropped on Funa airfield, and the field immediately caught fire and spread. In addition, the Aalborg airfield in Denmark was also bombed. According to news from the German side, four of our planes were shot down last night. This is completely untrue. In fact, only one of our planes did not return to its base. (Havas dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: According to the Danish capital radio station controlled by the Germans, Aalborg has implemented a curfew since the airfield was attacked twice by the British Air Force. From 9 pm to 4:30 am, civilians are not allowed to linger on the streets, except for those traveling for work and doctors and nurses. The radio detailed the defense measures during the air raid and warned listeners outside of Aalborg that other parts of Denmark might be declared in a state of air raid danger.

<h3>Statistics on British and German Ship Losses; London Official Announcement</h3>
<p>London: According to official announcements, in the week ending at midnight on April 20, a total of three British merchant ships were sunk due to enemy action, namely the "Swanbay" (5,000 tons), the "Messai" (1,037 tons), and the "Tempe" (5,405 tons). No neutral ships were sunk. During the same period, the German ships sunk included the "Freisen," which sank after hitting a water mine near Lansa, south of Stockholm, Sweden. In addition, two other German ships, one of about 3,000 tons and one of about 6,000 tons, were sunk by British submarines. The total number of German losses since the start of the war is estimated at about 450,000 tons, while the total number of British losses is 672,778 tons. There were no losses of escorted ships last week. The German ships in Narvik on April 9 that are believed to have been sunk include the oil tanker "Willing" (11,776 tons), "Grimfield" (8,096 tons), "Achen" (6,388 tons), "Altuna" (5,892 tons), "Henheuer" (5,836 tons), "Bargenheim" (4,902 tons), "Henrick Fesa" (4,879 tons), and "Faleringhaus" (4,339 tons).

<h3>German Planes Discovered on the Southeast Coast of Britain at Night; Their Intention Was to Lay Mines; British Planes Intercepted and Repelled Them</h3>
<p>London: Last night, planes that seemed to be from the German side were discovered off the southeast coast of Britain. The sound of heavy artillery was heard, and there were flashes of light in the sea like exploding bombs. Planes were also discovered on the east coast last night, and British anti-aircraft guns immediately opened fire, and fighter planes also took off to prepare for battle. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The British Air Force Department recently stated that several enemy planes were discovered off the coast of East Anglia and the southeast coast last night. Their intention was to place mines in the Thames Estuary and the Humber Estuary. Anti-aircraft guns and warships at several British locations opened fire on them, and fighter planes also took off to intercept them. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: According to news from London received here, German planes went to bomb the eastern and southeastern coasts of Britain last night.

<p>Stockholm, Sweden: The "Svenska Dagbladet" Berlin dispatch stated that the German side is currently preparing administrative agencies in Denmark similar to the "protectorate" system in the Czech and Bömisch-Mährisch provinces. The German ambassador to Copenhagen has been appointed as the Danish "protector" and Hitler's personal representative. Also, a message from Oslo stated that British and French expatriates in the city are still free, but they must report to the police station several times a day. Their request to leave the city has been rejected. (Reuters dispatch of the 23rd)</p>

<h3>British Chancellor of the Exchequer Proposes Wartime Budget with Expenditures Exceeding £200 Million, Increases Taxes to Make Up the Shortfall</h3>
<p>London - Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon presented the second wartime budget to the House of Commons today. As expected in September of last year, the Chancellor proposed increasing the standard rate of income tax from seven shillings to seven shillings and sixpence. He stated that expenditures for the first seven months of the war were £905,000,000, and the expenditure rate seems to be increasing. The total planned expenditure for this year is £2,667,000,000, of which £2,000,000,000 is specifically for the war effort. This amount is certainly huge, but if the administrative departments did not intend to economize on expenditures, it would be even larger. I believe that if the heads of departments, officials, and the public can continue to do their best to economize on their expenses, it will be a valuable contribution to winning the war. The Chancellor also stated that of the £500,000,000 in debt previously approved by the House of Commons, £91,500,000 remains. A surtax will be levied on annual incomes exceeding £1,500. The tax on each type of beer will be increased by one penny. The tax on each bottle of whiskey will be increased to one shilling and ninepence halfpenny. The tobacco tax will be increased to four shillings per pound. The match tax will be fifty pence per twelve dozen (boxes). Letter postage will increase by one penny. Imperial postage rates remain unchanged. Foreign postage was previously two and a half pence and is now three pence. Airmail postage remains unchanged. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Germany and Romania Sign Trade Agreement, Stipulating Germany Exchange Arms for Romanian Oil</h3>
<p>Bucharest - An official gazette published here last night stated that negotiations between German and Romanian representatives to conclude a supplementary annex to the German-Romanian economic treaty have now concluded. It is understood that the content includes provisions for Germany to exchange arms for Romanian oil. (Haitong dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Bucharest - It was officially announced here last night that Romania has signed a commercial treaty with Germany. Romania will continue to sell 130,000 tons of oil to Germany each month. Sources familiar with the matter say that Germany has apparently obtained favorable terms for purchasing oil. Germany's recent requests for several other raw materials have not been met. However, it is generally believed that Romania will seek to satisfy Germany's needs. People here believe that Romania has agreed to include Bohemia and Moravia within Germany's trade scope, but Romania has refused Germany's request to increase the exchange rate with the Romanian currency.

<h3>Britain and France Use Diplomatic Tactics in Attempt to Alienate Soviet-Italian Relations, Britain Promises Soviet Benefits to Prevent Raw Materials from Being Shipped to Germany, Franco-Italian Outstanding Issues Negotiating Opinions Clash</h3>
<p>Stockholm Capital - The Stockholm Times correspondent in Moscow cables that when commenting on the matter of German troops invading Norway, all Soviet newspapers adopted a neutral attitude. At the same time, the Soviet authorities are working hard to establish friendly relations with Yugoslavia. This is not unrelated to the activities of the Allied countries attempting to separate Germany and the Soviet Union. In short, Moscow has now become the center of diplomatic activities for all parties, and Stalin and Molotov are in a very advantageous position, and can also take advantage of the situation to profit. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome - Regarding the rumors from Britain and France that the Allied countries will take diplomatic steps in Rome and Moscow, official sources here remain tight-lipped. Political sources familiar with the matter say that even if Britain and France want to carry out certain activities in Rome and Moscow, they may not be able to produce any new situation. It is rumored that Britain will conduct contacts with the Soviet Union, while France will negotiate with Italy. This probably proves that Britain knows that Anglo-Italian negotiations are hopeless, and at the same time, Franco-Italian issues such as Corsica, Tunisia, and the Suez Canal are also very different, making it difficult to get closer. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - According to reliable sources here, if Britain and the Soviet Union sign a new trade agreement, the Soviet Union will guarantee not to re-export goods from Britain or overseas neutral countries to Germany. This news is the first indication that the Soviet Union may be turning to the British economic track. Generally, it is believed that the Allied countries' diplomatic war against Soviet foreign policy is only beginning to yield results favorable to the Allied countries. According to news obtained by a reporter from an authoritative source in the Soviet Union, although the Soviet Union is willing to allow and prevent British or neutral countries' goods from being shipped to Germany, in exchange for Britain's goodwill in concluding a new trade agreement with the Soviet Union, it is currently unwilling to discuss the issue of reducing its own exports to Germany. According to the Soviet Union's permission, the Soviet Union must fulfill one of the two preconditions for signing the agreement proposed by the British representative last Saturday. These two conditions are: (1) The Soviet Union decides absolutely not to re-export British goods to Germany; (2) The Soviet Union begins to limit its own raw materials or industrial products from being shipped to Germany. According to the British side, in view of the current war situation, these two conditions are the only basis for the conclusion of an Anglo-Soviet agreement. According to the Soviet Union, it seems prepared to expand the scope of the original text of the first condition and also include neutral countries' goods in the ban. Regarding the second condition, a Soviet spokesman said, "If Britain is willing to buy Soviet goods at a good price, Soviet exports to Germany will naturally decrease." It is generally expected that the above opinions will be raised when Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky holds private talks with British officials. (International News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Rome - Regarding the rumors from Paris that the French government has warned the Italian government that if Italy attacks Yugoslavia, France will consider Italy to be formally participating in the war, official sources in Rome have denied this. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - Havas News Agency has recently learned from reliable sources that German leader Hitler did intend to attack Hungary and Yugoslavia at the beginning of this week, and believed that Italy, in order to protect its interests, could also send troops to intervene in the South. The scope of the war can be expanded to the Balkan Peninsula and the Mediterranean Basin, but until the last moment, Italy did not agree, either because the conditions it raised were not fulfilled by the German side, or because the Italian government temporarily changed its attitude, one of the two must be true. Therefore, although Germany has concentrated troops on the borders of Hungary and Yugoslavia, Italy has not followed suit. Italy's attitude is still a question at this time and should not be taken too optimistically. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Italy Expands Air Force, Three-Year Plan Requires 7.6 Billion Lire</h3>
<p>Rome - The government recently submitted a three-year air force expansion plan to the Fascist Professional Organization Council, proposing to allocate 7.6 billion lire to strengthen the air force and expand bases. The allocation is as follows: (1) 300 million lire for the 1940 fiscal year; (2) 350 million lire for the 1941 fiscal year; (3) 110 million lire for the 1942 fiscal year. (Havas dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French Blockade Policy Against Germany to be Implemented in Southeast Europe</h3>
<p>Paris - Political figures here recently stated that Britain and France have decided to intensify the blockade of Germany in Southeast Europe, preventing it from obtaining needed goods from there. Germany has sent Economic Director-General Clodius of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Romania, and sent Agriculture Minister Darré to Hungary, in an attempt to offset the Anglo-French plan. However, Germany's hope of obtaining supplies from Eastern Europe, especially food, is very slim. It is estimated that the countries in the Danube River basin will have a poor harvest this year, and Britain and France are also purchasing extensively. Therefore, the grain needed by Germany is becoming increasingly scarce. Generally, when British Foreign Secretary Halifax recently held talks with Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, the plan to intensify the blockade of Germany was also involved.

<h3>Tianjin Silver Deposit Problem, British and Japanese Merchants Reach Agreement, One-Eighth of the Silver Deposit Used for Relief Funds, the Remainder Sealed in the Tianjin Bank of Communications</h3>
<p>London - According to reliable sources here, the news that Britain and Japan have agreed on a solution to the Tianjin British Concession silver deposit problem has been widely reported and is about to be signed. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had lunch at the Japanese Embassy in Britain yesterday. British and Japanese diplomats in the Far East are making final discussions on the Tianjin silver problem. After the Japanese army lifts the blockade of the Tianjin British Concession, both sides can sign an agreement. It is generally believed that the agreement will include the following three points: (1) Chinese silver stored in the British Concession, totaling US$800,000, will be used with US$100,000 for North China relief funds, and the remaining US$700,000 will be sealed in the Tianjin Bank of Communications; (2) The British authorities will not hinder the circulation of legal tender and United Reserve Bank notes in the Concession; (3) The British Concession authorities will allow Japanese police to cooperate in cracking down on Chinese terrorists in the British Concession.

<h3>Britain Pays Attention to the Dutch East Indies Issue</h3>
<p>London - According to general opinion, Britain still considers the Dutch East Indies to be one of the issues that warrants serious attention. British experts on Far Eastern issues believe that if Germany invades the Netherlands, it is hoped that the United States can take various steps to prevent Japan from occupying the Dutch East Indies. If the United States resists Japan, Britain will naturally be able to provide assistance. However, political circles feel that this kind of public expression and imagination seems inappropriate, believing that such expressions only serve to affect Britain's goals, only make the flames of American isolationism rise, and mistakenly believe that Britain wants to involve the United States in the Far East disputes.

<h3>American Ships Patrol Philippine Waters, Monitoring British Ship Movements</h3>
<p>Manila - The Manila newspaper reported reliable news that two American warships have been ordered to sail out to monitor the movements of a certain British ship, because it is heard that the British ship is doing something in the Philippine waters. This move by the United States is carried out in accordance with neutrality laws. The US Navy authorities have used local wireless to call soldiers back to their ships in the past three days, saying that they will hold special exercises. It is heard that last week a British ship instructed a merchant ship at a certain point between Manila and Northern Luzon to prove its nationality. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Japanese Government Develops North Sea Fishing Rights, Establishes Fishing Company to Compete with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to sources familiar with the matter, the Japanese government will establish a fishing company in the North Sea in accordance with its established national policy. The total capital is set at 120 million yen, in order to protect the fishing rights of the Japanese in that area and to cope with the competition or interference from the Soviet Union. The company will be formed by merging nine major fishing companies. In addition to providing a portion of the capital, the government will also be in a supervisory position and has the right to appoint and remove directors and decide on the distribution of funds and profits. For several years, the fishing rights of the Japanese in the North Sea have been repeatedly infringed upon by the Soviet Union, and they have often failed to receive government assistance. It is believed that future negotiations will definitely obtain better conditions. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo - According to Japanese sources, it is heard from responsible parties that four Japanese fishing boats were recently detained by the Soviet side in the high seas of Posiet Bay.

<h3>Corpses Litter the Qinghu Line, Refugees Arriving in Shanghai Say They Stepped Over Corpses Along the Way</h3>
<p>Since last Sunday (the 14th), the Japanese military authorities dispatched Japanese cavalry from all directions, guided by the Xu pseudo-forces, to carry out a major search and suppression of Gu Fusheng's troops stationed there. Gu's troops calmly resisted for a considerable period of time using mobile tactics and then quietly withdrew, which ultimately resulted in the Japanese and puppet forces suffering losses without gains. The Japanese and puppet forces then vented their anger on the local farmers, burning and killing at will wherever they went. It is said that the losses near Guanyintang (about ten miles southeast of Huangdu) were the most severe. According to a certain gentleman who was captured and escaped, the mile or so he escaped through was completely traversed by stepping over corpses. The amount of slaughter is generally visible. Near Panlong Zhudi, corpses were piled up along the road, the heat was steaming, and the stench was flying, which was too horrible to bear. Since the 20th, the Japanese troops gathered there have slightly stopped their brutal actions, but the residents are still avoiding them in fear. At the same time, security announcements have been found posted on the walls of Panlong Zhudi, but the evacuated residents dare not return. It is also rumored that Gu's troops will unite with the New Fourth Army and the Tian Huizi troops to come and retaliate, so residents who continue to evacuate to other places are still continuously on their way, and the Japanese and puppet troops stationed there are very panicked.</p>

<h3>Japan's Wartime Financial Burden: Foreign Exchange Shortage and Inflation Relying on Loans for War Expenses</h3>
<p>Japan launched the war of aggression against China, aiming for a quick victory, believing that it could achieve complete success in a few months. Therefore, it did not prepare for a long-term war. Initially, it did not expect the Chinese people to be united and valiantly resist, and now it has been nearly three years, and the more they fight, the more spirited they become. Japan, on the other hand, has revealed a state of financial and human resource distress. According to a Reuters Tokyo dispatch, Prime Minister Yonai admitted that "the Japanese people have never had the experience of a long-term war, nor have they suffered the severe hardships experienced by European countries, so it is not easy to cope with the war situation." A few days ago, Army Minister Hata Shunroku, in a speech at the annual meeting of Japanese army division commanders, also admitted that "there are trends in domestic and foreign events that do not allow for an optimistic view of the overall situation," and urged the military to strive for frugality in the use of materials and the payment of funds. However, with the situation deadlocked, it is impossible to reduce military spending. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the government intends to reduce the expenditures already approved by the Diet, consulting with the Ministry of Finance and the Army and Navy, and the authorities of each ministry are trying to be as frugal as possible. However, a spokesperson for the Ministry of the Army immediately denied this, saying that the army's expenses have been reduced to an absolute minimum and cannot be reduced any further. The military is resolute, and the Ministry of Finance is suffering. As for manpower, the Japanese government has implemented a ban on shops employing men aged 12 to 30 and women aged 12 to 20, starting from March 1, intending to absorb young men and women into munitions factories and various factories engaged in national policy work. War takes financial and human resources as the main factors for victory. Now that both are in such dire straits, how can one talk about victory? Even maintaining the status quo for a long time is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>On March 14, the London Financial Times published an article saying that Japan's war of aggression against China has been going on for nearly three years. Although its power to continue the war has not been exhausted, in recent months, resources have been greatly depleted, and people in the country have generally believed that the "China Incident" urgently needs to be ended in a relatively short period of time. The Royal Bank of Canada once stated that the Japanese people now keenly feel that the government's huge expenditures are too burdensome, and most of the funds come from severely increased tax rates and huge numbers of domestic public bonds. The seven-year military equipment program submitted to the Diet last month, totaling 2.858 trillion yen (one trillion is one million yen, the same below), will greatly increase the burden on the people. The decreasing volume of trade between Japan and countries outside the yen bloc has made foreign exchange even scarcer. The import control regulations have recently become more and more stringent so that raw materials needed for the war industry, such as iron sand, crude rubber, and kerosene, can be continuously transported into Japan. Rice is the main food, but due to severe drought and poor autumn harvests in Korea, there is a severe food shortage. Due to the drought and shallow river water, the output of hydroelectric power has been greatly reduced, coupled with the lack of coal, the situation is even more serious. In the past three years, Japan's annual national expenditure has more than doubled (from 5 billion to more than 10 billion). The military expenses used for the Sino-Japanese War in these three years are roughly as follows: the fiscal year 1937 to 1938 was 2.500 trillion, 1938 to 1939 was 4.800 trillion, and 1939 to 1940 was 5.300 trillion yen. If the land and sea military expenditures not directly related to the "China Incident" are included, the total amount is (1) 4.000 trillion, (2) 6.000 trillion, and (3) 7.100 trillion yen in the order of the above years. In 1940 to 1941, this expenditure was about 6.755 trillion yen. If the seven-year military equipment program is passed by the Diet, the total amount will increase to 7.164 trillion yen. The tax rate was already very heavy, but now it has been increased, and new taxes have been levied. The amount of tax revenue from 1936 to 1937 was 1.051 trillion yen, which increased to 2.245 trillion yen from 1939 to 1940. It is estimated that in 1940 to 1941, this income may increase to 400 trillion yen. In order to make up for the huge war expenses, it is necessary to raise huge amounts of debt. The public bonds raised from 1939 to 1940 exceeded those from 1936 to 1937 by about nine times. These are all raised domestically. As for foreign debt, it was 1.312 trillion yen in July 1937, which decreased to 1269 trillion yen in September 1939. In June 1939, one month before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the total amount of domestic debt was 10.380 trillion yen. By the end of the year, it had increased to 11.893 trillion yen. By the end of 1938, it had increased to 16.223 trillion yen. In October 1939, it had increased to 20.457 trillion yen. The Minister of Finance recently announced that from 1940 to 1941, the government will raise new debts of 5.797 trillion yen, so the total amount of domestic debt will reach 26.253 trillion yen. During the war, the number of banknotes in circulation increased greatly. In July 1937, the total amount was 1.580 trillion yen. By the end of 1938, it had increased to 2.755 trillion yen. By the end of 1939, it had increased to 3.817 trillion yen, exceeding the tax-free limit of 2.701 trillion yen. In addition to regular banknotes, the army authorities also issued "military scrip" to pay for the soldiers' salaries in China. This scrip is mostly absorbed through exchange and has become a part of Japan's regular issuance. However, the details of the military scrip have not been announced by the authorities. Japan's main financial problem is still the lack of foreign exchange. In the first ten months of 1939, Japan's trade with countries outside the yen bloc had a trade deficit of more than 437 trillion yen, compared with 496 trillion yen in the same period in 1938. Trade between Japan and countries within the yen bloc accounted for 25% of Japan's total exports in 1937, and now it has reached 50%. As a result, in 1939, there was a trade surplus of 814 trillion yen. Because a large part of this trade is the re-export of goods obtained from countries outside the yen bloc, Japan pays out foreign exchange and receives only yen. This shows that at least half of the trade surplus within the yen bloc is a huge factor in causing a shortage of foreign exchange. In the first ten months of 1939, the total amount of foreign exchange shortage was estimated at about 700 trillion yen, excluding allocations for invisible trade items. Japan is currently implementing a strict commodity distribution system to ensure that the scarce raw materials purchased with foreign exchange are only used for things necessary for the war. However, imported raw materials are then made into goods and are allowed to be exported and sold in order to increase foreign exchange. In order to encourage trade, a linkage system was implemented in March 1938, linking the import of raw materials with the export of finished goods. The number of raw materials imported is limited to the value of the goods containing such raw materials previously exported. However, the Japanese government issued strict regulations prohibiting the transportation of these goods to countries within the yen bloc. This regulation had some effect in the first seven months of 1937 because exports increased by 10% during this period. However, it is still lower than 35% of the total exports in 1937. The system initially allocated 300 trillion yen from the total gold reserves as working capital for expenses. As the foreign exchange for international payments continues to be short, Japan's gold is also flowing abroad. The gold shipped to the United States each month in 1937 was worth about 90 trillion yen. The gold shipped to the United States each month in 1938 and 1939 was also worth as much as 60 trillion yen. It is now believed that in addition to the 500 trillion yen of liquid reserves still stored in the Bank of Japan, the amount of gold remaining in the country is very small. Therefore, efforts are being made to increase the output of gold mines. The current annual gold production is worth about 200 trillion yen. On November 11, 1939, a plan to encourage gold production was implemented, giving an additional 12 yen or so per gram of gold produced above the normal amount compared to the US gold price, with the increase ranging from 25% to 50%. In short, according to the Royal Bank of Canada, Japan has taken into account the huge cost of the war, so its financial affairs are handled with great competence and foresight. However, it did not expect China's resistance to be so prolonged, and in recent months, the state of being stretched has become increasingly exposed. Although there is no immediate sign of any collapse, based on the current situation, it can only be maintained by continuing inflation and allowing prices to rise and living standards to deteriorate.</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador to Japan Visits Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs to State U.S. Position on Tianjin Concession Blockade</h3>
<p>Tokyo: U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew visited Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tani at 11:00 a.m. today to discuss the recent intensification of the blockade of the Tianjin Concession and explain the impact on American citizens. (Kyodo News Agency dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: It has been learned that U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew is scheduled to return to the country for vacation in a short period of time. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Water Supply Panic in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Tokyo's engineering department estimates that unless there is heavy rain, Tokyo may run out of water within a month. Tokyo's current water officials go to shrines every day to pray for the water god to quickly send heavy rain. The water in the Murayama and Yamaguchi reservoirs decreased greatly last week, and the bottom of the lake is like a desert. All housewives have reduced their water consumption from 600,000 tons to 480,000 tons after being called upon by the authorities. In addition to reducing consumption, the authorities are also trying to increase supply in order to obtain new relief from other places. However, there is still a shortage of 160,000 tons of water every day. (United Press dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Lack of Doctors in Japanese Villages</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to a report announced by the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, there are 3,600 villages in Japan with a total population of 10 million, but there is not a single resident doctor. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, village doctors have tended to practice in profitable towns, resulting in a lack of village doctors. Newly graduated students from medical universities are not interested in the profession of village doctor because they spend a lot of money and time studying. They claim that they will lose more than they gain if they return to their hometowns after graduation. The total number of doctors in Japan in 1938 was 62,934, of which 51,837 were self-employed. The others worked in government and school institutions. The total number of doctors in 1938 was 2,500 less than in 1937. (United Press dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Construction of Large Sluice Gates in French Vietnam Will Greatly Increase Cultivated Land</h3>
<p>Paris Airmail: A large sluice gate being built by French Vietnam at the confluence of the Dai River and the Red River is nearing completion. From now on, 125,000 acres of barren land that it is still seeking to reclaim can be used for cultivation. The rice yield is expected to increase by 200,000 tons per year, worth about 2.5 million Vietnamese piastres. Because that vast barren land has always been flooded during the rainy season in summer when the Red River is in full spate, and suffers from dryness in winter. Once the sluice gate is completed, excess water can be drawn off in summer and river water can be used for irrigation in winter. The convenience is obvious. The construction cost of this water conservancy project totals 60 million French francs. The materials used include 31,000 tons of cement, 2,000 tons of steel bars, 57,000 truckloads of soil, and 105,000 cubic feet of stone blocks, for a total of 1.08 million cubic feet of dikes and embankments, and 20,000 workers. It is so great. This project is only a part of the economic development plan of Vietnam. Since its implementation, the area of rice fields in Vietnam has expanded from 1.73 million acres in 1890 to 6.175 million acres (Havas dispatch from the 22nd).</p>

<h3>Establishment of Sichuan Provincial Library: Purchase of More Than 20,000 New Books Open Day and Night</h3>
<p>(Chengdu Airmail) The Sichuan Provincial Library, previously actively prepared by Mr. Guo, Director of Education, who hired Mr. Yue Liangmu and Cao Zubin at the site of the Zhongcheng Elementary School on Chenshou Street for three months, has been roughly completed. The opening ceremony was held at 10:00 a.m. on April 10. Those who attended included Mr. Dai, President of the Examination Yuan, Mr. Liu Dongfu, representative of Director Deng of the Pacification Headquarters, Mr. Jiang Fu, Director of the Central Library, Mr. Guo Youshou, Director of the Education Department, Mr. Chen Zhushan, Director of the Construction Department, Mr. Hua Guojun, Dean of the College of Liberal Arts of Jinling University, and other officials from various institutions and guests from all walks of life, more than 200 people. Mr. Guo, Director of the Education Department, presided over the meeting and reported on the origin and preparation process, saying that although a library was established in this province in the early years of the Republic of China, it was small in scale and was transferred to the municipal government due to the provincial funds being insufficient. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, in view of the need for library undertakings, the provincial government made a resolution to establish a provincial library. However, it seemed that the war of resistance was in full swing and the progress was halted. After I came to the Education Department, I considered this matter to be of great importance to the culture of the entire province, so I began to prepare in January of this year. Fortunately, the local people enthusiastically supported it, and the colleagues in the library worked hard. More than 20,000 new books, more than 100 kinds of magazines, and 40 to 50 kinds of daily newspapers were purchased within three months. In addition, Mr. Dai, President of the Examination Yuan, and Director Deng each gave special donations of Chinese books. The Wartime Book Collection Committee and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Board each donated Western books, which shows the enthusiasm of the officials and academic circles for protecting the cultural undertakings of this province. I believe that Sichuan Province has a very deep and long history of culture. Woodcut printing enjoyed a high reputation in the Tang and Song dynasties. Today, most of the book carvings in the country have been lost due to the war, but Sichuan is the only one that is complete, which is enough to be proud of. I hope that the colleagues in the libraries of this province can receive instructions and strive to shoulder the great task of promoting the culture of Sichuan Province. Then, Mr. Dai, President of the Examination Yuan, delivered a speech, saying that I was supposed to rest for a while because I felt left out of the opening ceremony of the Sichuan Library. However, because today's ceremony is a major event, I came to participate. I have always been concerned about books and libraries, because my family was poor when I was young and it was not easy to buy books. At that time, there were very few collections of books in Sichuan, so I took care to preserve even one book when I was young. I used to read late at night and never stopped. When I studied in Japan, I often stood in bookstores and read all day long. This developed a habit of regarding books as treasures and knowing that it is not easy for ordinary people to read. Over the years, private individuals have specially donated books to establish libraries, totaling nine, with about 300,000 volumes. As for my feelings about libraries, I think that the value of a book lies in the fact that someone reads it. What is the point of collecting books if you do not read them? I have observed that some libraries are seriously managed and always hope that people will read them, while some bad libraries bind and hide books and do not allow people to read them at all, which is very regrettable. Although Sichuan's book carvings are less than other bureaus, the proofreading is very accurate. Now, most of the other bureaus have been damaged. I hope everyone will work hard to collect, promote carving and printing, and cultivate a reading atmosphere. Sichuan's culture has always been very prosperous, and the people are very skillful. After the establishment of the provincial library, it will be able to further promote culture and benefit the people. Finally, Mr. Cao Zubin, the director of the library, gave a reply, briefly describing the plan for this year's undertakings, hoping to do his best to live up to the expectations of all the gentlemen. Starting from the 10th, the reading rooms for books, magazines and newspapers will also be fully open at night.</p>
<h3>Overview of Adult Education Year Implementation in Guizhou Province (2)</h3>
<p>(3) Characteristics of the Plan The plan has four characteristics: 1. Taking the war of resistance and nation-building as the center, the implementation of the Adult Education Year only takes popularizing education and eliminating illiteracy as a means, and takes "strengthening the mobilization of the masses and developing the power of the war of resistance and nation-building" as the goal. Therefore, the goal of the plan is to strengthen its national consciousness, inspire its patriotic enthusiasm, and firmly establish its belief in the victory of the war of resistance and the success of nation-building in spirit, and to enhance its essential skills during the war of resistance in life. All courses, teaching materials, teaching and guidance take the war of resistance and nation-building as its axis. 2. Using political power to promote it, the political style of this province is that all constructions are implemented by order. The law education order is also ordered by the government, directly from the city to the townships and villages. The implementation of the Adult Education Year still follows this style and uses political power as a promotion. 3. Mobilizing social forces to promote the implementation of the Adult Education Year is not a unilateral responsibility of educators or basic schools, but mobilizing the province's intellectuals, civil servants, party and government cultural institutions and groups to concentrate their efforts to promote it. 4. Coordinating with the requirements of basic education, the fundamental requirement of national basic education is to adapt education to life. Therefore, the plan emphasizes the three aspects of education content: political training, literacy training, and life training, in order to coordinate the integrity of life. In terms of teaching methods, it emphasizes social activities to adapt to the needs of actual life. In terms of the educational process, it formulates continuing education methods to prepare for further progress.</p>
<p>(3) Implementation Organization</p>
<p>In order to seek advice and cooperate in the implementation, the implementation plan stipulates that provincial and county adult education year promotion committees should be set up to be responsible for the design and promotion of all facilities for the adult education year.

<h3>Securities: Foreign Stocks Stir Up a Rebound, Wheelock Marden Shares Once Fell by Fifty Dollars; Rumors of Phone Price Hikes Cause Stocks to Soar</h3>
<p>The prices of various stocks at the Public Securities Exchange, due to the concentration of Chinese and foreign speculators, have experienced sudden rises and falls, which are not favored by those with calm minds. They believe that the rubber boom is a recent lesson, and to jump into the whirlpool is to invite misfortune. This saying is indeed somewhat true. Currently, there is an excess of speculative capital in Shanghai, and the value of the legal tender has fallen. Being conservative means falling behind. Speculation has become a widespread trend, which cannot be suppressed by superficial talk. However, speculation is permissible, but it must be based on knowing the right time. Simply following blindly will inevitably lead to small gains not compensating for large losses. Recently, various stocks have experienced large rises and falls again. Those who do not understand think that there are many dark secrets. In fact, there are quite reasonable reasons for this, but speculators are taking advantage of them. A brief description of the general situation is as follows:</p>
<p>The most violent of these storms was undoubtedly the Wheelock Marden share. With a face value of ten taels, the highest price reached two hundred and seventy-two yuan. Yesterday, it fell tens of yuan. The reason for the increase was that each old share had the right to subscribe for a new share at a price of twenty-five yuan. However, the increase was too rapid and excessive, which led to widespread selling and a sudden decrease. Jardine Matheson has a connected relationship with Wheelock Marden. Market prices in investment and speculation clusters have caused a great uproar. This belongs to the shipping and dock stock category.</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson Textile shares have a face value of five taels. Last winter, the market price was seventeen or eighteen yuan. Recently, it has reached seventy-three or seventy-four yuan. The reason for this is that its inventory of raw materials is both large and cheap. Based on the current yarn price, each piece can earn four hundred yuan. Its coarse cloth is one yuan higher per piece than other factories, and its fine cloth is two yuan higher than East China goods. Moreover, its goods can travel unhindered to both guerrilla areas and occupied areas. This belongs to the textile industry stock category.</p>
<p>The market prices of International Trust shares, Yangtze Bank shares, and Shanghai Bank shares have also soared. This is because International Trust owns 25,000 shares of Wheelock Marden, Shanghai Bank has the most shares in China Land Reclamation, and Yangtze Bank is associated with them, so it also increased with the market. This belongs to the financial industry.</p>
<p>業廣 has a face value of five taels, and 中国营业 has a face value of ten yuan. Their upward trend is due to the recent increase in land prices by more than 20%, and the increase in building materials by several times. The Shanghai Municipal Council stipulates that from July, donations will be increased by 50%. Real estate developers can satisfy their desire to increase rents, so some investment attention is focused on this. This belongs to the real estate stock category.</p>
<p>As for other stocks, such as China Land Reclamation, its Mentougou coal mine has resumed normal coal production, and the stock price has increased with the coal price. Various rubber stocks previously fell sharply because the Netherlands was inevitably involved in the war. Recently, they have rebounded because Japan has taken the same attitude as the United States towards the Dutch East Indies, and there is still hope for the future. However, only seven types are related to the Netherlands: 英达区, 英楂华, 克罗华, 楂华康沙, 兰格志, 苏门答腊橡皮, etc. This must be known.</p>
<p>Yesterday, telephone stocks soared to a new high of forty yuan because the May telephone bills were delayed, and rumors spread that the telephone company would raise prices starting in May. The Shanghai telephone business has also developed abnormally along with speculation. Areas such as (1), (3), (7), (8), and (9) cannot be installed even if desired, resulting in transfer fees. Advertisements seeking them are sometimes seen in the newspaper, with some claiming as high as one thousand yuan or seven or eight hundred yuan, which has led to rumors of telephone price increases. In fact, commercial telephones certainly have different functions, while residential telephones are in a different situation.</p>
<p>In general, the assets of each stock company have increased with the market price, and all stocks made by the Public Securities Exchange can be used as collateral at HSBC. This is the largest outlet for speculators. However, doing business against Jewish merchants is extremely difficult, as their methods are infinitely subtle, and the Chinese are probably not their match. It is better to be cautious and not pursue the current temporary gains. This is also something to pay attention to. (Star)</p>
<p>Yesterday, the attitude of the operators of the Public Securities Market suddenly changed, so the general price was keenly corrected. The number of transactions was incredibly large, and the convenient methods frequently implemented by the exchange were used to the greatest extent to match the seemingly tidal-like unlimited orders.</p>
<p>Wheelock Marden shares were constantly released yesterday, falling significantly. Compared with the highest price the day before, there was once a height difference of fifty yuan. At the close, buying increased and appetite improved. The final transaction price was two hundred and thirty-six yuan.</p>
<p>International, Shanghai, Yangtze, and other stocks, under the pressure of sellers, all closed at the lowest price of the day.</p>
<p>Although China Land Reclamation shares were also swept away by profit-taking, their resistance was stronger. The opening price fell from thirty yuan to twenty-eight yuan and a half, but the closing price returned to twenty-nine yuan, with very good buying interest.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks had extremely large transactions. Although the New York spot price trended lower, the price still rose more than it fell. Rubber Trust, Lan Ge Zhi, Kang Sha Lai Te Xing Pu Ji, Rubber Trust once saw a new high of fifteen yuan.</p>
<p>The securities gray market remained unimproved yesterday. Type C shares once saw a price of eight yuan three times, but still failed to stabilize. However, the decline was slightly stable, with a tendency to hover. It is feared that it will still not be easy to be optimistic this week, because the previous declines were due to the outflow of spot goods and small, not entirely due to bulls closing positions. Moreover, the money supply has not eased at all, and transactions by various households are sudden and temporary, mostly of a temporary nature, or simply exchanging one for another. For example, at No. 41, Type C was bought and Type D was sold in the morning, and Type C was bought and Type A was sold in the afternoon. Runli bought in the morning and sold out again in the afternoon. Lianyi sold in the morning and recovered in the afternoon. The rest were just sporadic scalping transactions. As a result, the decline continued by one to four cents. The total number of transactions was estimated to be about one million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: fifty shares of the newly formed New New Company were traded at a price of eleven yuan. London, 22nd (Monday) telegram: Today, the listed market prices of various British Far East companies' stocks showed a slight decline. HSBC Bank shares each fell half a pound, with prices all at ninety-three and a half pounds. Guthrie rubber shares also fell six pence, with a price of eighteen shillings and three pence, unchanged.</p>
<p>London, 22nd (Monday) telegram: Today, the listed market prices of Chinese foreign debt remained calm. There were no changes in the upper and lower bonds.</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Arbitrage Once Reached More Than Five Points</h3>
<p>The gray market for foreign exchange, spot terms are loose, a good reason being that speculators on forward months have opened up swap deals, and bulls continue to release their positions. There are still many Chinese businessmen doing swaps and arbitrage. It is heard that someone has posted a US dollar triangle of 125, with the combined monthly interest rate actually being more than five points. In the afternoon, speculators on forward month US exchange still disgorged positions, the market situation is still stable, swap deals are slightly squeezed tighter, and transactions are not deserted.</p>

<h3>Buying Interest Dwindles: The Gold Market Deteriorates Daily</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold gray market situation continued to be sluggish, and the potential for recovery remained difficult, because the exchange market continued to trend looser, and the unusually tight money supply, especially the interbank lending rate, reached as much as four points, which affected many retail investors. Many floating long positions sought to sell their goods, and it was also heard that foreign merchant banks were urgently demanding the redemption of gold collateral, with absolutely no possibility of continuing to do so. Those without real strength could only lament their helplessness, and as a result, buying interest in the gold market gradually dwindled. After the price was suppressed, it was difficult to rise. The entire day's transactions were about two thousand taels.</p>
<p>Spot gold falls fifty yuan weakly</p>
<p>Since the morning, the opening price per bar (ten taels) was still stable, initially the silver firm bought twenty taels from the gold firm, still at five thousand seven hundred and seventy yuan, with no change compared to the previous close. After opening, the foreign exchange slightly loosened, and gold firms and securities houses tended to disgorge, and at that time a certain money exchange firm also had a strong intention, disgorging a certain amount, and for a time the position suddenly felt surplus, falling to thirty-five yuan, the gold firm bought ten taels from the silver firm, for five thousand seven hundred and thirty-five yuan. Thereafter, a certain securities house changed from selling to buying, plus the silver firm continued to absorb, immediately rebounding fifteen yuan, the securities house bought thirty taels from the gold firm, for five thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan, until around eleven o'clock the selling wind revived, the general floating long positions, due to settlement relationships, closed their positions one after another, and those who bought in were few, falling thirty yuan, the gold firm sold fifty taels to the silver firm, for five thousand seven hundred and twenty yuan, at noon the selling wind slightly subsided, and pulled up ten yuan, the securities house bought ten taels from the gold firm, for five thousand seven hundred and thirty yuan. Near the close, the money exchange firm sold again, falling five yuan more, selling thirty taels to the silver firm for five thousand seven hundred and twenty-five yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, because those who had closed their floating long positions came back to buy in, the opening price was five yuan higher, the gold firm bought twenty taels from the money exchange firm, for five thousand seven hundred and thirty yuan, subsequently bought by the securities house and the silver firm, rising another ten yuan, the money exchange firm bought fifty taels from the silver firm, for five thousand seven hundred and forty yuan, after which the securities house reversed from buying to selling, and retail investors also sold, and so turned downward, the silver firm and the silver firm mutually traded twenty taels, giving way to five thousand seven hundred and twenty yuan, then the gold firm sold ten taels to the silver firm for five thousand seven hundred and twenty-two yuan as the evening closing price, as a result, the decline continued by forty-eight yuan compared to the previous day, the entire day fluctuating by fifty yuan.</p>
<p>Jewelry gold motionless all day</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael in silver shops remained unchanged all day, Datongxing still suspended at five hundred eighty yuan, the same price as Xintongxing, with the buying price reduced by about fifteen yuan.</p>
<h3>Spot cash reached a high of 135 yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange remittances and bills decreased from high to low, with each ten yuan rising from one hundred and twenty yuan in the morning to as high as one hundred and thirty-five yuan, the peak for this year, seeing that the supply of spot cash was relatively abundant, and so sharply falling to ninety-five yuan, near noon rebounding to one hundred and five yuan, in the afternoon continuing to rise to one hundred and ten yuan, rebounding five yuan compared to the previous day, the Money Industry Association interbank lending rate, both morning and afternoon markets still hung at two corners, unchanged.</p>
<h3>The decline in Japanese notes intensifies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British and American gold pounds closely followed the decline in gold prices, and there was no shortage of supply of British gold notes, and the trend of American gold notes was even softer, once retreating to sixteen yuan three corners three points, but the foreign exchange market was still flat, why did American gold notes repeatedly tend to decline? This proves that the recent money supply is tight, and those with goods are successively selling their goods in order to exchange them for legal tender and fund turnover. Hong Kong notes and notes from Annam and the Philippines all followed the downward trend, the supply of Japanese gold notes was increasingly abundant, and the market price felt increasingly unsustainable, retreating to one yuan two corners seven points in the evening market, Korean notes initially had an endless supply, once retreating to nine corners nine points four li, subsequently there was a slight need, and the evening market rebounded to one yuan, but still one point smaller than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Buying Sentiment Pervades, Cotton Yarn Prices Soar Sharply, But What About Actual Sales Being Dull?</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been circling steadily for two days, reported another rise yesterday, and the increase was even more dramatic, because spot goods were dry and the trading floor was tight, so although actual sales to customers were not strong, the enthusiasm was even greater. In fact, the price of a certain country's yarn is strangely high, and the price of 20-count yarn in May has reached 1430-40 yuan in full cash, higher than our yarn, and so 20-count Double Horse yarn has been driven up.</p>
<p>Spot cash rose sharply for 20-count Double Horse, with buying sentiment pervasive and confidence very strong, opening immediately at a customs price of one thousand four hundred and five yuan, and an out-of-warehouse price of one thousand four hundred and twenty yuan, and in an instant, because there were many buyers, the market price directly trended higher to one thousand four hundred and fifty-four yuan, with the factory price at one thousand four hundred and forty-five yuan, and the closing price saw another increase. Upon investigation, half-day transaction statistics totalled one thousand nine hundred and fifteen bales, and the market price of 20-count Double Horse spot goods rose fifty-four yuan. Also, today (24th) there are one thousand two hundred and seventy-five pieces of cotton yarn being shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each gang is listed below.</p>
<p>Fellow merchants: 1,810, Hong Kong 100</p>
<p>廈鬥: 5 Total: 1,915</p>
<h3>Factory Offices Activate, Raw Cotton Flourishes</h3>
<p>Transactions in native cotton improved slightly, because yarn prices advanced step by step, causing interdependent raw cotton to flourish accordingly. At the same time, factory offices gradually showed signs of activity. The current cotton transaction situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Da Zhong Ji: 255.00, fellow merchant bought 300 bales</p>
<p>Huoji flower: 213.00, fellow merchant bought 200 bales</p>

<p>Pengjiapu: 254.00, Shenxin bought 100 pieces</p>
<p>Another report on the foreign cotton market: yesterday morning the New York cotton market, the other cotton markets were especially calm, and afterwards the market situation turned active, and a portion of short sellers covered, as a result the closing price, compared to the previous day, rose five to eight pounds per note, Indian cotton, including forecasts, rose two rupees per note, Egyptian cotton rose five or six pounds per note.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions were quieter yesterday, but selling prices were exceptionally high, but with money being unusually tight, factories had a strong buying intention, and fellow merchants were unwilling to be forced to sell cheaply, so transactions were quiet, but in general, the consensus was optimistic about cotton prices. The factory price for cotton yesterday, converted at an exchange rate of six yuan to the US dollar, is as follows:</p>
<p>20s US Mitlin: 295.50</p>
<p>20s also: Substandard 184.90</p>
<p>32s also: 312.60</p>
<p>32s also: Substandard 302.00</p>
<p>42s also: 315.50</p>
<p>42s also: Substandard 306.00</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Hoarders Active, Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>National cloth: yesterday the market started flat and then rose, attracting the need of this street, and hoarders also started to be active, but due to the tight money supply, a portion of cargo owners were also willing to unload along with the market, so the morning market was flat, and then with constant demand, sentiment turned firm, and prices rose step by step, as a result, coarse cloth and fine twill each rose five corners to one yuan per piece, coarse cloth rose two corners and a half to seven corners and a half, bleached cloth rose by varying amounts, about one yuan or so, this street transacted more than one thousand pieces of various goods, Cantonese merchants handled nearly two hundred pieces of dyed cloth, colored twill, and bleached cloth, Zhejiang and Fujian merchants handled three hundred plus pieces of bleached cloth, fine cloth, and coarse cloth, and Yanjing merchants handled more than ten thousand pieces of blue cloth, bleached cloth, pongee, foreign yarn, etc.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth: with the yarn price continuing to rise, merchants from the north continued to handle purchases actively, and fellow merchants and hoarders on this street also continued to search, so the rising trend was even more fierce, with the highest spot price for Longtou fine cloth reaching forty-six yuan seven corners and a half, and the futures price forty-eight yuan seven corners and a half, and the closing price slightly lower, with the current selling price at forty-six yuan four corners and the futures price at forty-eight yuan five corners, and the listed price for 叫君子哔叽 one yuan four corners three points and a half, and next month one yuan five corners three points, although the distance between the futures prices is far, buyers are happy to absorb them, showing the tight market sentiment, and the money supply remains tight.</p>
<p>Exports: today (24th) there are 535 pieces of cotton cloth being shipped to Hong Kong, and another 85 pieces being shipped to Singapore.</p>
<p>Imports: yesterday there were 18 pieces of cloth coming to Shanghai from Wenzhou.</p>
<h3>The Grain and Rice Market Finally Stabilizes, Japonica Rice Arrivals Still Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rice market was entirely dependent on the amount of goods in the market, the coldness or heat of sales, and the willingness of those holding goods to sell, and so goods such as No. 1 Chen Saigon and Broken Point Rice Tea remained steady, while the rest, continuing the previous soft trend, were all illusory. The early market sales floor was small, and there was also a lot of recoiling, so the market price immediately depreciated by half a yuan, and so fire-cracked rice only sold for around 44 yuan and a half, No. 2 Saigon 43 yuan and a half, small fire-cracked rice 42 yuan and a half, and those acting with strategy all took advantage of the cheap prices to buy in, and the market price once rebounded, seeing a return to the original price, but ultimately lacking real sales, it immediately declined again, and as a result the closing prices were all shorter by about half a yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>After thick and thin japonica and other domestic rice sources were cleared, and daily arrivals occurred, sentiment was not as firm as before, and yesterday another one thousand four or five hundred bags of japonica rice from Changzhou and other places and light rice from Qingsi, Nanhang early and late rice, etc., arrived at the port, and Shanghai stocks gradually increased, and it was heard that the gray market outside the floor was sparse and abnormal, prices falling by seven or eight corners to one yuan or so, with Wuxi clear japonica at 44 yuan eight corners, 44 yuan and a half, Changzhou clear japonica 44 yuan, powdered japonica 43 yuan, and Su Kun white japonica only 43-44 yuan, Qingsi special light rice 45 yuan, medium grade 43-44 yuan, and Nanhang early and late rice 42-43 yuan, and lower grade 41 yuan, the route for glutinous rice was also more relaxed, but the price level was cheap alone, and cargo owners were unwilling to sell lightly, so although the market was soft, there was no significant change in the selling price, with only the median seeing a depreciation of three to five corners.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market was soft again yesterday, after the opening of the morning market domestic rice from various routes arrived one after another, and foreign rice orders and goods from Hong Kong also flowed in continuously, and floating households and retail customers, due to the tight money supply, all sought to sell late in the market, and those gaining profits also urgently sought to sell, and so current rice prices from all grades universally depreciated, especially small fire-cracked rice declined more violently, once falling to within 42 yuan and a half, and then with the price decline causing a reduction in selling, it rose again to 43 yuan, but in the afternoon it saw a decline again, recoiling No. 2 Saigon, April-May opened at 54 yuan two corners and a half and two corners in the morning, and the lowest shrunk to 514 yuan in the afternoon, the close saw some floating short positions cover and rebounded one corner, the unified rolling model futures opened at two hundred and fifty or sixty tons, with current foreign rice at five thousand bags.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Transactions Quiet</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's transactions, because exports have been controlled by Japanese forces, and retail customers are unwilling to buy more due to the increasing heat, and those being directly sold by manufacturers leaving the factory for the unified market are fewer than five thousand bags. After rebounding once, the buying from hoarders turned sluggish yesterday, and prices were invisibly loose and chaotic, and it was heard that Lao Chepai opened at 13 yuan seven corners five or six points, with the factory price differing by a small number of points, and other Japanese-owned factories in the inland were only shouting prices, and there were no formal transactions.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market transactions were also clear, because exports are currently stagnant, and Japanese factories lack the desire to buy, although some Chinese factories are selectively approaching, eating is particularly cautious, while those holding goods still seek to struggle, resulting in a deadlock on both sides, and it was heard that the price for goods being sent to the factory continued to open at 20 yuan zero eight corners and a half to six corners and a half.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Raw Soybean Oil Rebounds by One or Two Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's raw soybean oil market, first inheriting the sluggishness of the previous day, the market was listless, and afterwards, because soybeans continued to flourish, and the bottom accumulation of basket soybean oil was loose, and the barrelled oil that arrived contained excessive water, causing disputes, and for a time there was a sense that goods should not be on the market, and sentiment took the opportunity to activate, and peanut oil also raised one or two yuan as a result, but the number of transactions was not large, and only one hundred pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were opened in total, price: foreign market price column, ninety barrels of Qingdao raw oil, one hundred cans of Jiangbei Menzhuang raw oil, five hundred cans of Yantai raw oil, twenty barrels of Dalian soybean oil, one hundred pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil, one hundred pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, one hundred and fifty pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, and four hundred dan of Dayou factory soybean oil.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Both Cart and Coarse Sugar Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to loosen. Public and longevity brands, and second-grade coarse white sugar spot goods, new goods were priced at 64.40 to 64.30 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.30 yuan; old goods were at 64.05 yuan, down approximately 0.35 yuan. Taikoo cart white B mark from the Western depot was priced at 71.40 yuan, a slight decrease of 0.20 yuan; old goods were at 71 yuan, with the lower grade refunded accordingly. H mark cart red sugar remained at 51 yuan, while Dutch red sugar spot goods were at 54 yuan, an increase of 0.25 yuan. Re-exported goods included 240 packages of Zhangzhou Diaoging, priced at 51.50 yuan.</p>

<h3>Rumors of a "Special Police Force" Being Established: Tax Issues Difficult to Resolve. The So-Called "Maturity" is Not Optimistic. When Will the "Bad Soil" Be Peaceful? Unforeseen Developments.</h3>
<p>The establishment of the "Special Police Force" for road construction beyond the boundaries, since the signing of the "Police Affairs Agreement" between the Municipal Council and the puppet regime in February, although there has been a trend towards imminent implementation, it has been delayed until now, with the opinions of both parties not entirely consistent, and no results. On the 18th of this month, the Chief Superintendent of the Municipal Council, Mr. Bowen, officially announced that the "Special Police Force" would be announced within the last three weeks. He also stated that the Municipal Council and the puppet regime would respectively send Mr. Bowen, Mr. Lu Ying, and Colonel Igarashi Tsutomu as representatives to discuss the matter again in Hongkou on the afternoon of the 19th. However, neither party has made any further announcements about the outcome, and there is no further news.</p>
<p>Repeated Talks Seem to Be Maturing</p>
<p>Until yesterday, authoritative sources revealed that the organization of the "Special Police Force" is expected to be established soon, and that the negotiations between the two parties have reached a very harmonious level. However, the economic issue has not yet been resolved satisfactorily. After this news was released, it was confirmed by Mr. Chu Ch'ien-an, who said that although it is still impossible to say when the "Special Police Force" will be established, it is believed that the matter has reached a mature stage and that results will be achieved in the near future.</p>
<p>Personnel Selection and Organization Have Been Internally Determined</p>
<p>It is also rumored that the "Special Police Force" may be established in the middle of next month. The personnel will still be dispatched by both parties and mutually agreed upon. Currently, the personnel have been assigned, but officials believe that it is not yet time to announce them. The details of the organization have also been drafted, but further discussions are needed and the plan must be approved by both parties before it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Tax Disputes Are Difficult to Resolve</p>
<p>The unresolved issue is the tax issue. It is rumored that the puppet regime has requested the Municipal Council to consider and resolve it as soon as possible. The Municipal Council's response is that this issue must be submitted for discussion after the new board of directors takes office. The tax issue is the focus of the road construction issue beyond the boundaries. According to general observations, the Municipal Council's economic situation is currently not stable, and the issue of tax collection for road construction beyond the boundaries will inevitably be disputed by both parties, and it is unlikely that a consensus can be reached in the short term. Therefore, the statement that the "Special Police Force" is about to be established is not necessarily optimistic.</p>
<p>The Hotbed of Crime Is About to Relocate</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News stated that the cargo and freight sector recently indicated that the West District Police Department, established under the temporary agreement between the Municipal Council and the "Shanghai Municipal Government," is expected to be established in the middle of next month. The negotiations are progressing smoothly, but the financial issue still needs to be resolved. The address of the new police station and the new police chief have been selected. It is said that the casinos and opium dens in the area will be closed at that time. Those who operate gambling and opium businesses have tried their best to lobby, but to no avail. Therefore, they will close or relocate elsewhere in the middle of next month. As for the financial issues of the new police district, the Municipal Council stated that it must wait for the new board of directors to decide. The Shanghai Times also stated that the Japanese-language Continental News had reported that the West District Special Police Force would be established in mid-May. Last night, the reporter asked Major Bowen, the head of the Municipal Council's Police Department, about this, and he claimed to be unaware of it and did not know when the team would be established, as the establishment date had not been determined. Both parties are still planning and it is not yet known when they will be ready.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Post Office: Facing Difficulties</h3>
<p>It Is Heard That Zha Pei Went to Ningbo and Had Some Contact</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the environment of the Shanghai Post Office has become increasingly difficult since the establishment of the so-called "new organization" in Nanjing. Mr. Zha Pei Lin, the Shanghai Postmaster, recently went to Ningbo, in addition to inspecting the postal affairs in the Nanjing area, and had considerable contact with Wang Xianghou, the so-called "Postal Director of the New Organization." This kind of contact may be a compromise for maintaining postal rights, but it is sufficient to show the increasing difficulties of the Shanghai Post Office. As for the administrative affairs of the bureau, there have been no changes so far. Everything is carried out in accordance with the orders of the Kunming Postal Administration.</p>
<h3>The Dredging Bureau: The Situation Is Complicated</h3>
<p>The Confiscated Ships Are Not Returned The Japanese Side Only Works for Its Own Benefit</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency, the resumption of dredging work by the Shanghai Dredging Bureau is extremely far from the actual start date. According to a senior customs official, the dredging vessels and survey vessels confiscated by the Japanese side have not been returned by the Japanese side, except for a very small number. It has been found that the Japanese side has sent its own personnel to places such as Gaoqiao and Yangshupu to facilitate its own work, and the Zhang Huabang shipyard, which has been destroyed, has not yet been returned. Moreover, since the bureau was forced to reorganize, the power of Japanese personnel has surpassed that of Chinese and Western personnel. In other words, Chinese and Western staff are only for reserve purposes. The rumors that the dredging work will begin in early May, according to his observations, may not be true.</p>
<h3>The May 1st Holiday is Approaching: The Labor Community Prepares to Commemorate</h3>
<p>The International Labor Day on May 1st is approaching. The labor community in Shanghai has always celebrated this holiday. Given the extraordinary times and the special environment of Shanghai, it has been decided not to take extravagant forms or hold any gatherings. However, in order to commemorate Labor Day and celebrate with workers around the world, it has been decided to take a day off as usual on that day. At the same time, in order to promote the meaning of labor, the labor unions of various industries have decided to instruct their members to emulate the spirit of international workers' struggle, wage a death-defying war against the current harsh environment, and vow to support the national policy of resistance against Japan, striving for the final victory in order to obtain the true liberation, freedom, and equality of Chinese workers. According to the Dagang News Agency, the police authorities of the two concessions have decided to take joint precautions due to the large number of commemorative holidays in May to ensure order within the boundaries and maintain public peace.</p>
<h3>Resignation of Japanese Director Tian Cheng of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Japanese Side Hopes Okamoto Ikkaku Will Fill the Vacancy, But According to Regulations, It Must Be Elected by the Board of Directors</h3>
<p>Following the election of Tian Cheng as a Japanese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council this term, rumors immediately spread that he intended to resign. Yesterday, the Tokyo branch of the Domei News Agency confirmed this via telegram. It is noted that Tian Cheng has been residing in the East Hospital for the past few weeks, and he was unable to attend the inauguration of the entire board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council on the 18th. Local Japanese sources claimed that Tian Cheng had no intention of assuming office, and the vacancy should be filled by Okamoto Ikkaku, the Japanese director who lost to Tian Cheng by two votes in the election.</p>
<p>Okamoto Ikkaku to Fill the Position. According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Domei News Agency yesterday, Tian Cheng intended for Okamoto to become a Japanese director and had therefore resigned voluntarily, because he felt that Okamoto was a talent in diplomacy and an expert familiar with Chinese affairs. He also knew that Okamoto had left the diplomatic world to become a candidate for the position of director of the Shanghai Municipal Council. In the past, Okamoto was the</p>
<p>Japanese Consul-General in Singapore. Okamoto is currently the director of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China and was also one of the Japanese directors of the previous Shanghai Municipal Council. Before the recent board of directors election, the Japanese side suddenly put forward five candidates and made arrangements in advance, attempting to have all five elected in order to break the established rule of the Shanghai Municipal Council's ratio of five British and American directors to two Japanese directors. Thus, Okamoto Ikkaku and Hanawa Yūtarō, the two former directors, as well as the three newly elected directors, could all be included. Unexpectedly, the</p>
<p>Election Results showed that the Japanese attempt completely failed, maintaining the original state of two Japanese directors. Even more unexpectedly, Hanawa Yūtarō was re-elected, while Okamoto failed. However, the "Deputy Director of the China Railway Company," who was not very familiar with the situation in Shanghai, entered the board of directors with two more votes. At a time when the Japanese community in this city was</p>
<p>Tense Regarding Relations with the International Settlement, those in the know expected that, given his qualifications, it would be difficult for him to settle into the position. However, according to the rules of the Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors, if a director's position becomes vacant during the year, it should be filled by other directors. Therefore, after Tian Cheng's resignation, the same procedure should be followed. What the Japanese side said, that Okamoto Ikkaku, who lost the election by two votes, would automatically fill the position, is completely</p>
<p>Unclear on the Rules. However, it is understood that if the Japanese side hopes that Okamoto Ikkaku will be appointed to fill Tian Cheng's vacancy, then the other directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council will accept their intention when discussing the matter at the meeting. This point is entirely a matter of procedure. As for the Japanese side's explanation of succession, it does not conform to the facts. It is also understood that after Tian Cheng's vacancy, it is impossible to elect another British or American director to fill it.</p>
<p>Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors to Elect Committee Members Next Week</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Board of Directors has decided to produce a list of candidates for committees on the economy, personnel, music, police affairs, and film censorship at next week's meeting.</p>
<h3>British Community Celebrates St. George's Day Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wreaths Placed Before the Statue of Peace; the 2nd Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment Celebrates the Battle of Ypres</p>
<p>According to the English-language *North China Daily News*, the British community in Shanghai commemorated St. George's Day today (the 23rd). At 8:30 AM, a wreath-laying ceremony was held in front of the Statue of Peace on the Bund, with a brief speech by Reverend Quili Fanter, President of the Shanghai Branch of the British St. George's Society, and the wreath was laid by Vice President Raynal. Several British troops also participated. From 7:45 PM to 9:49 PM tonight, members and friends of the 　　治　Society will attend a private screening of the film "有　之　" at the Cathay Theatre. After the 　, an informal banquet and dance will be held at the French 　Society. In addition, the 2nd Battalion of the East Yorkshire Regiment of the British Army stationed in Shanghai celebrated the Battle of Ypres today with a banquet and free films. Ypres is a town in Belgium, held by the British Army during the World War until the end of the European conflict. Three major battles took place there, especially the fierce battle of April 23, 1915, during the Second Battle of Ypres.</p>
<h3>National Government Commends Fan Keling</h3>
<p>Mr. Fan Keling, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, received a Chinese official document yesterday morning, which was shaped like a diploma and stamped with a vermilion official seal. After the office translated and explained it, it was learned that it was a certificate of commendation distributed to Mr. Fan by the National Government. Mr. Fan expressed his deep satisfaction with this, because he had not received this honor before. The certificate of commendation was sent to Shanghai from Chongqing and signed by Mr. Kong Xiangxi, the former President of the Executive Yuan. The certificate stated that the National Government highly commended Mr. Fan Keling's disaster relief work and his enthusiasm for public welfare.</p>
<h3>Abe Has Indeed Arrived in Nanjing</h3>
<p>It has now been confirmed that Abe Nobuyuki passed through Shanghai on the Kashima Maru at noon on the 21st. The ship was designated to dock at the mouth of the Huangpu River, and all passengers arriving in Shanghai disembarked there, without stopping at the Huishan Wharf. At 5:00 PM, it set sail for Nanjing. The ship is currently still in Nanjing and is scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 25th and depart for Japan on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Forced Payment of Accounts at the End of April; Hoarders Emerge One After Another; Banks and Money Shops Refuse Long-Term Loans on Daily Necessities; Increased Warehouse Rents and Discount Rates Push Hoarders to Their Doom</h3>
<p>With the April deadline approaching for various industries in Shanghai, banks and money shops are strictly refusing loans to hoarders, making it difficult to turn around their finances. Businesses and shops are vigorously demanding payment of debts, and the rents of Chinese and foreign warehouses are also limited to increased payment in proportion. All hoarders are forced to sell their hoarded goods. The details of each situation are explored below.</p>
<p>Refusal to Turn Over Funds. After the war, the loan operations of all member banks and money shops affiliated with the Banking Association and the Money Shop Association are implemented in accordance with the financial and economic measures of the four banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank, to adjust Shanghai's finances. Legitimate loans for all industries and businesses, any application that is deemed unqualified or considered an illegitimate loan, will be refused. Currently, all banks and money shops have already investigated the details of all speculators and hoarders among their clients. Many are facing this difficult situation at the end of April. Amidst the repeated demands for payment of hoarded goods from businesses and shops, they have tried every means to negotiate loans from various banks and shops, but all have been strictly rejected. The goal is to avoid providing funds to turn over, to overcome this major difficulty. All hoarders are extremely worried.</p>
<p>Forced to Sell Goods. The price of goods in Shanghai has risen this time, hoarders are blinded by profit, and most of the goods they have taken in are food, daily necessities, and European and American goods. Since they were piled into Chinese and foreign warehouses, they have gained extremely high profits from the rising prices of goods. Only seeking profit, they do not care for the people's livelihood. For a long time, they have been unwilling to sell. Since the establishment of the flat price associations in the two concessions, hoarders have rushed to sell. Causing the goods of larger hoarders to be ignored, piled up in warehouses, and warehouse rents continue to increase. Now that these hoarders have no access to loans, and their debts are forced to be paid, they have no choice but to take out their hoarded goods for sale, seeking to overcome the difficult pass of settling accounts at the end of April. It is heard that in recent days, the trend of discounting in the financial market has been great, and the discount rate has been arbitrarily increased to 240 yuan, almost enough to put the hoarders to death.</p>

<p>The flagship USS Augusta of the US Asiatic Fleet, carrying US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 AM on the 22nd. After arriving in Shanghai, it is now berthed at the British naval pontoon. Although the ship was damaged after hitting a reef in Coron Bay in the Philippine Islands, the damage was not serious. After repairs, there is no need for further inspection. Therefore, the four-star command flag of the US Asiatic Fleet was changed from Admiral Hart's private yacht, the USS Isabel, to the</p>
<p>USS Augusta. The USS Isabel is now moored west of the flagship. According to a reporter from the *New Voice News*, the USS Augusta must remain in Shanghai for one month before heading north to join the annual summer patrol.

<h3>Far Eastern Countries Unanimously Support the Moral Re-Armament</h3>
<p>Conference Held in Rangoon, All Ports in China Participate</p>
<p>The Far Eastern Moral Re-Armament Conference will be held in Rangoon, Burma, next month. The conference will last ten days, from May 9th to May 18th. Countries in the Far East, such as the United States, Japan, India, Siam, the Philippines, and various parts of Southeast Asia and Australia, have sent representatives to participate. The purpose of the conference is to awaken people to do their best with conscience and ability, remove prejudice, unite with integrity, and establish a true foundation for world peace. On the Chinese side, in addition to the people in this city's movement who have already sent Mei Lide, Tang Minghe, and Yao Xisheng to participate, it is heard that Kunming and Chongqing also have representatives attending the conference. Burma has been promoting the Moral Re-Armament Movement in recent years. There is no effort that hasn't been made, and the conflicts between religions and ethnic groups in the country have been greatly reduced. The conference in Burma was initiated and convened by Ms. Manning Tai and others who came to Shanghai before. It is expected that the movement will be greatly promoted in the country and the Far East.</p>
<h3>Intentions for Opening the Pearl River are Unclear; Britain Will Not Resume Sailing for the Time Being; Taikoo, Jardine, and South China Line Liners Have No Plans to Go to Guangzhou</h3>
<p>After the fall of Guangzhou, the Pearl River shipping was controlled by the Japanese army, and foreign ships suspended their voyages. However, Japanese ships still sailed as usual. Since the blockade, it has been almost a year and a half. Although the third country has repeatedly negotiated, it has not been effective. Although foreign ships cannot sail to Guangzhou, they are not subject to any losses for transporting new routes separately. Therefore, the problem of opening the Pearl River has not been valued recently. However, it was recently heard that the Pearl River was suddenly opened automatically last Saturday (20th), but its intention is unknown. However, the announced import and export goods have strict restrictions and must be applied for in advance, which is not easy to handle in terms of facts. If the plan remains the same, the loss of ship schedules will be huge. The South China Line liners of British companies Taikoo and Jardine in this city have no plans to go to Guangzhou. Therefore, the resumption of British ships on the Pearl River is under consideration, and it is feared that it will not be implemented this month.</p>

<h3>After the Chinese Buddhist Association Moves to Chongqing, the Shanghai Office Closes</h3>
<p>Because the Chinese Buddhist Association has moved its office to Chongqing, its Shanghai office on Hart Road has begun to close.

<h3>Rickshaw Pullers in Nanshi Carry Out a General Strike</h3>
<p>The 2,000 rickshaw pullers in Nanshi are currently on strike to protest against the increase in rickshaw rentals. After several days of stalemate, the matter has not been resolved. The striking rickshaw pullers have joined together to appeal to the pseudo "Social Affairs Bureau," but there is no hope of a solution at this time.</p>
<h3>Infectious Diseases are Rampant; Typhoid and Tuberculosis are Raging; Rumors Spread That a Theater is Spreading Typhus; Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Explains</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring in this city, various infectious diseases have been extremely prevalent. According to statistics from the knowledgeable and reasonable health department, during the past week, one foreigner and 37 Chinese died from typhoid fever, and tuberculosis is particularly rampant, with a very high mortality rate. Six foreigners and 78 Chinese died in the past week. In addition, three-day measles and other diseases are also extremely popular.</p>
<p>External Rumors</p>
<p>In view of the rumors that a certain theater is spreading epidemic typhus, the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department hereby declares the following: The reason for typhus is that it is transmitted from someone who has already been infected to others, and the transmission is due to flea and lice bites. Such fleas and lice must first come into contact with a person suffering from the disease, and the lice become infected with the germs, and then spread the infection from person to person. Therefore, the transmission of this disease must have direct contact with people who gather these fleas and lice before it can occur. There is no doubt. Fleas and lice reside in the human body and leave soon after, and the people who gather fleas and lice are unlikely to be theatergoers.</p>
<p>Opportunity for Infection</p>
<p>The opportunity for us to contract diseased fleas and lice when we bump into others while walking is actually greater than in the theater. Based on the above, it is unreliable to say that these kinds of fleas and lice exist in the theater because it once housed refugees. The refugee shelter in a certain theater was closed as far back as May of last year. The refugees had already been moved out, and the house had been rebuilt and renovated. The health department sent people to inspect it, and no fleas or lice were found. If we say that there are typhus infections in the theater and blame it on the former housing of refugees, it is impossible. The health department still pays close attention to the theaters in the concession at any time and checks for the occurrence of lice.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Nanchang are Gradually Weakening</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Spokesman Admits</p>
<p>At a press conference held by the Japanese military spokesman the day before yesterday, in addition to admitting the activity of guerrillas on the outskirts of Shanghai, he also admitted that there have been recent troop movements in Nanchang, and it is possible that the military strength in some places is gradually weakening.

<h3>French Concession's Chinese and Vietnamese Police Burdens Lightened</h3>
<p>The Police 　 Runs Inexpensive Rice, Which Both Chinese and Vietnamese Police Can Purchase</p>
<p>Commissioner of Police Fabre of the French Concession, in view of the extremely high price of rice in Shanghai, in order to reduce the burden on the police officers of the Chinese and Vietnamese police stations, issued Ordinance No. 16 yesterday, stating, "A large amount of Chinese japonica rice has been purchased. All Chinese and Vietnamese personnel of the Police Department who receive salaries included in the budget of the Shanghai Municipal Council may purchase three-quarters of a picul of rice at a price of 27 yuan and 40 cents per person. This rice will be distributed by Inspector General Gibie according to the following order: Béthune Police Station, Foch Police Station, Central Police Station, MacMahon Police Station, Joffre Police Station, Xiaodongmen Police Station Xujiahui District, Political Affairs Office, Motor Vehicle Department, Detective Office, Judicial Police, Garrison, Other Personnel. Mr. Gibie will put the rice assigned to each person into bags with a capacity of one-quarter of a picul, and deliver them to the chief or director of the responsible department. Therefore, every five people can get three bags of rice. The empty bags should be returned within three days after distribution. Each person should pay the rice price of 27 yuan and 40 cents, which the chief or director will deduct from their April salary on payday, and the deducted amount should be immediately sent to the secretary-general. Single Vietnamese personnel who dine in the canteen of this office should take necessary measures at each department, select a suitable place, and safely store the rice that should be allocated. Signed on April 23, 1940, Commissioner of Police Fabre.</p>
<h3>There is a Saying About the Norwegian Ship Sailing to the Far East Resuming Its Voyage</h3>
<p>Largely Hopeful of Success; Awaiting Formal Orders</p>
<p>After the Danish and Norwegian countries in Northern Europe were invaded, the Danish and Norwegian ships sailing to the Far East concentrated in various ports one after another. It is now heard that the Norwegian ships in the Far East are still flying the Norwegian flag and resuming regular voyages to the Far East, it is said that when they are sailing. When navigation is restored in the future, the wartime navigation rules of Britain and France must be followed. As for Denmark, which has now fallen, it has not yet been announced whether its Far Eastern ships that are berthed at British ports will be allowed to sail again, and whether they will still fly the Danish flag or the Allied flag. The fact that Norwegian ships are about to resume sailing was confirmed by the British Embassy Office here yesterday. It is said that the current situation has been clarified, and it is generally hoped that Norwegian ships will resume sailing. An employee of the Tianxiang Foreign Company, which represents Norwegian ships, said that he had received the news, but it would not be implemented until formal orders from Hong Kong arrived.</p>

<h3>Dentist Robbed, Thief Arrested</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 4th of this month, at 9:45 AM, the house of dentist Zhu Xie Tang, located at 176 Avenue Edward VII, was suddenly invaded by five armed bandits. They threatened with guns, searched and robbed for about an hour, taking away gold and silver jewelry, clothing, and cash, totaling about 9,072 yuan, and escaped with the stolen goods. The victim reported the case to the police for investigation. At 8:30 AM the day before yesterday, Zhu Liangjiang, a relative of Zhu Xie Tang, went to Hongkou on business and suddenly encountered Li Yifan, a Ningbo native who was one of the bandits in the case, at the intersection of Baoding Road and Huade Road. He followed him and saw Li enter his residence at No. 7, Lane 375, Baoding Road. He immediately reported to the Yulin Road Police Station, which sent Chinese detective Liu Chunshu and detective Peng Zhenxuan to arrest Li secretly. They confiscated a watch, a roll of silk, and 449 yuan and 40 cents in cash. Together with the suspects Yu Yichao, Shi Xingchun, and Xing Jiulin, they were imprisoned in the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case and requested a postponement. After questioning by Judge Xiao Peishen, he ordered the suspects to be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Abductions Occur Frequently; Families Should Pay Close Attention; Women and Children Relief Association Issues a Serious Warning; Orders All Branches to Assist in Paying Attention</h3>
<p>Since a large-scale abduction ring was uncovered in Hongkou, the matter has aroused great social attention. The police authorities are continuing to investigate and arrest criminals to completely eradicate them. The Children's Welfare Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Chinese Children's Welfare Association and other children's welfare agencies are also deeply concerned about this. The China Women and Children Relief Association in this city is an agency dedicated to rescuing and educating abducted women and children. Recently, due to frequent abduction cases, it has warned families to pay special attention to the care of their children. It also notified branches in various places to assist in paying attention. It is said that young boys and older girls are the most likely to be abducted. After being trafficked abroad, they are either given to people as adopted children or used as prostitutes to make huge profits. This kind of separation of family members is truly unconscionable. The association currently has more than 500 women and children in its care, who are abducted women and children over the years who have not been claimed by their families. Some of them were sent by various police stations.</p>
<h3>Gold Bars Confiscated on the New Beijing</h3>
<p>When the British company Taikoo's ship New Beijing arrived in Tianjin from Shanghai last time, the customs confiscated a large number of smuggled gold and legal currency, totaling more than one million yuan. It is said that a certain second comprador of the ship has fled. The Beiyang Ban Lisheng of Jardine Matheson in this city was originally scheduled to leave Tianjin for Shanghai yesterday. According to a reporter from *Ping Ming News*, before the ship left Tianjin, customs officers suddenly confiscated a large number of Japanese currency (all old bills) worth about 40,000 yuan and a wooden barrel of silver dollars on the ship's cargo ship. The smugglers have fled without a trace, so the chief comprador, the second comprador, the boatswain, and the steward of the ship were taken away for strict interrogation. Therefore, the ship's arrival in Shanghai may be delayed.</p>
<h3>Chen Zhaoxi: Bigamy and Fraud</h3>
<p>Wang Man scammed out of thousands of yuan, recently discovered and apprehended</p>
<p>Chen Zhaoxi (also known as Chen Caishou), a native of Anhui, is currently 42 years old. He was previously married to Jin Suhua, a woman from Taizhou. Later, in 1936, through the introduction of Lin Bixia, a student at Guangxia High School, Chen met Wang Man (an Anhui native, currently 28 years old), a high-achieving student at the school. At the time, Chen told Wang that his first wife had already passed away and expressed his desire to marry Wang as his second wife.</p>
<p>Wang believed this to be true and agreed. Consequently, they held a wedding ceremony in Hangzhou on May 14th of that year. After the wedding, they came to Shanghai and lived together at No. 44, Lane 847, Tian Road. With Wang's financial assistance, Chen established the Minyi Silk Flower Company at their residence. Later, Chen borrowed a total of 5,500 yuan in legal tender from Wang in installments. Among them, 2,000 yuan was borrowed from Wang's aunt, Cao Langshi, through Lin and other shareholders of Minyi. By February of this year, none of the borrowed money</p>
<p>had been repaid. Cao Langshi stepped forward to assert her creditor's rights, and a settlement was reached. Subsequently, Chen told Wang that he was experiencing significant losses in his shipping business and that he had to temporarily disappear due to pressure from creditors. Wang then temporarily stayed at her mother's home at No. 15, Lane 108, Mu Ming Road. Chen also disappeared from then on. However, recently, Wang Man received a confidential tip that Chen's claim of evading debt was</p>
<p>untrue. In reality, he was cohabitating with another woman. The location of their cohabitation was No. 44, Lane 847, Tian Road. Wang then reported this to the Shanghai Police Department. On the 6th of the month, Chinese Detective Xu Huanqing went to arrest Chen and found him in bed with another woman. He took them back to the police station. It was discovered that the woman's name was Jin Suhua, who was Chen's previous wife. It was only then that Wang learned that Chen's previous claim of his wife's death was a lie. Upon further investigation, it was revealed that Chen was aware that Wang had some financial resources and that his marriage to her was</p>
<p>clearly a form of fraud. The police department filed charges of adultery against Chen in this case. The First Special Court issued a summons, but Chen and others failed to appear. Consequently, an arrest warrant was issued, but Chen could not be found. A wanted warrant was then issued, and Chen was finally apprehended the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fourth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Wang hired lawyer Wu Linkun to appear in court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian and Qi Qi presented the facts of the case. Under the questioning of Judge Zhan Liangce, Chen was ordered to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>

<h3>Dalongxing Coal Company Urges Customers to Clear Stock</h3>
<p>Our local Dalongxing Coal Company has recently observed that customers are secretly hoarding goods after placing orders without withdrawing them, which has greatly affected the local citizens and caused them to suffer undue losses. Therefore, we have specially revised our business methods starting today. Hereafter, customers who purchase goods must be verified to be from the same industry or have actual needs before they are supplied as usual, and they must clear their stock within a limited time; otherwise, we will not sell to them.

<h3>Zhong Deli Robbery Case, Gang Robbers Sentenced Separately, Ten Handguns and Forty-Five Bullets Confiscated</h3>
<p>The Yongda Flower Shop at No. 14, Zhong Deli, at the intersection of Beijing Road and Shanxi Road, was previously broken into and robbed. When the robber gang had not yet left, the Central Police Department received a report, and Western Inspector Qiong Si, Chinese Detectives Feng Qishan, Gao Zhen, Yan, Peng Bingsheng, and other Chinese and Western detectives from the shift rushed to arrest them. They exchanged gunfire and fought each other, and the robbers Wu Shaoyou and Gao Zhigui were killed on the spot. Western Inspector Ma Ya was also slightly injured.

<h3>Christian Federation Charitable Sacred Music Concert</h3>
<p>The Christian Penni Fourth Mass, a world masterpiece, is scheduled to be performed for the first time in Shanghai at Moore Memorial Church on the evenings of April 27th and 28th. 150 people will participate, all of whom are members of various church choirs. Professor Zhao Meibo, a music expert, will conduct. Those who donate can listen to two hours of sacred music. Moore Memorial Church has already built a stage. Now that the weather is clear and pleasant, it is appropriate to hold this event in a suitable location for charitable work. Last time, Professor Zhao led his students to perform at the Guangming American Naval Chapel, and 5,000 people were unable to enter that day, which shows the grand occasion. It is said that there are limited seats in Moore Memorial Church, and it is feared that there will not be enough tickets on that day. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will remit money to exchange for tickets as soon as possible to avoid the possibility of missing out at the last minute.</p>
<h3>Regulations on Certification Methods for Retail Yarn and Cloth Products</h3>
<p>To be implemented from May 1st</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent letters to relevant trade associations yesterday regarding the certification of retail yarn and cloth products, stating, "We hereby inform you that the cotton yarn and cotton cloth used by local businesses to manufacture Western suits, shirts, ties, towels, parasols, shoe materials, and hat materials are mostly purchased piecemeal from yarn shops, cloth shops, or weaving factories. When their finished products are transported for sale and they apply to our chamber for certificates of domestic goods, it is inevitable that there is no basis for verification because the procedures for domestic yarn registration and wholesale registration cannot be applied. Our chamber convened a meeting of relevant industries on April 20 to discuss and agree on a method: for cotton yarn purchased piecemeal, no more than 39 small packages (less than one piece), and cotton cloth no more than ten bolts, for use as raw materials in this port, the purchaser shall present the invoice issued by the yarn shop, cloth shop, or weaving factory, and forward it to its respective trade association or federation for official stamp certification (such as Western suits, shirts, and ties, forward the request to the Western Clothing Industry Association). The Yarn Industry Association, the Machine Weaving Industry Association, and the Cotton Cloth Industry Association shall issue a certificate of sale of retail yarn and cloth based on the aforementioned invoices. When Western suits, shirts, ties, parasols, shoes, and hats are transported for sale to other locations and an application is made to our chamber for a certificate of domestic goods, the certificate of sale of retail yarn and cloth shall be submitted to our chamber for review along with the application for use as raw material proof. After each production run uses up the certificate of sale of retail yarn and cloth, it should be clearly noted for each batch sale. The associations that issue the certificates of sale of retail yarn and cloth should also compile statistics at the end of each month on the number of retail yarn and cloth sold in this port by a certain shop or factory and submit them to our chamber for wholesale registration. The retained sales vouchers from the yarn factories should also be retrieved from the factories and sent to our chamber for cancellation at the time of the summary wholesale registration. This method will be implemented on May 1st. All retail yarn and cloth purchased from May 1st onwards must be handled in accordance with this method; otherwise, our chamber will not issue certificates. For retail yarn and cloth purchased by the Western clothing industry, the towel industry, the parasol industry, the industry, and the Zhuang industry before the end of April, although the quantity is certainly not large, a clear distinction must be made before the implementation of issuing certificates of sale of retail yarn and cloth to avoid confusion. The respective associations should notify their members to list the names and quantities of the goods purchased from which shops before April 30th, and attach invoices and other documents to register with our chamber. If this procedure is not followed, our chamber will not issue certificates at that time. It is hoped that you will investigate and handle this matter accordingly. As for cotton yarn purchased in quantities of one piece or more each time, and cotton cloth in quantities of ten bolts or more each time, the wholesale registration procedure should still be prepared each time, and the monthly summary wholesale registration method does not apply. This is hereby declared."</p>

<h3>Re-transcription of Old Newspapers Sixty-seven Years Ago (364)</h3>
<p>(See this newspaper from the twelfth year of the reign of Tongzhi in the late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>A Praiseworthy Tale of Returning Money</p>
<p>Mu Ada made a living by selling. He went out very early every day because he had to go to the outskirts of the southern city to sell goods, carrying them into the city to sell. Early in the morning of the first day of the month, he had just left home when he saw a small blue cloth package on the ground. He picked it up and it felt very heavy, so he turned around and went back into the house. He opened it and found two hundred copper coins and ten foreign coins. Mu and his wife were both very happy to see them, thinking that they would have good luck if they obtained this unexpected wealth, so they congratulated each other! Mu suddenly thought, "I live a hard life, earning very little. It is natural for me to be overjoyed to get this all of a sudden, but I don't know who the loser is. If he is like me, or even worse off than me, won't he be worried about his life?" So he wanted to imitate the act of returning the money. His wife thought, "Since it didn't come from robbery, it was a gift from heaven, so it's okay to accept it. Why bother with such a foolish act?" Mu said, "If heaven is kind to me, what can't I get rich from? Why would it necessarily be from this little bit?" So he decided to return it to the loser. He also thought, "If I go out to trade, I'm afraid my wife will be greedy for small profits and not return it if the finder comes." Therefore, he did not do business and waited at the door. The next morning, an old man staggered over, with tears in his eyes, looking around. He knew he was looking for something. Mu deliberately asked, "Old man, where are you going? Please come in and sit down for a while." The old man replied that he did not know him and did not want to enter. Mu insisted on bringing him in. The old man told him that he would go look for something first and come back later. Mu asked what he had lost. The old man told him and said, "My home is in Yinjiang Bridge. My daughter-in-law died in bed. This money was borrowed from relatives of my deceased daughter. The two hundred coins are for travel expenses." Mu asked what identifying marks there were. The old man said that there was a black double coin thread on the corner of the blue handkerchief. Mu examined it and it was indeed the case, so he returned the original item to him. The old man burst into tears and kowtowed countless times. He also said, "Seeing that you are also in a difficult situation, I am willing to share a small portion to repay you." Mu swore that he would not accept it, so the old man bowed again and left. This is a rare occurrence among greedy vendors.</p>

<h3>The Reappearance of Rent Disputes</h3>
<p>— A Precedent</p>
<p>Despite earnest pleas from all walks of life, the public concession's tax increase was ultimately passed at the taxpayers' meeting. I remember reading an article in this journal last month, a small report after the Municipal Council announced the tax increase, which said: "With more than three months to go before July 1, the sublessors have already raised the rent in anticipation." As a result, the author came to the conclusion that if the tax increase passed, rent disputes would inevitably increase (or words to that effect). Now that the tax increase has been passed, sure enough, the first rent dispute has been seen in the newspaper of the 22nd: "All the tenants of Fongsheng Lane on Moore Road oppose the Yipin Loan Bank's advertisement threatening to cut off water to coerce rent increases." Although the advertisement did not necessarily mention the tax increase, judging from the phrase "This bank has only been leasing for a few months, but it is increasing the rent," it is somewhat related to the tax increase. At the same time, this dispute is seen in the newspapers; countless other disputes may be happening in everyone's homes.</p>
<p>Since land rent, water, and [blank space] have increased, the large and small sublessors have used this as an excuse to take several times the amount from the third-tier tenants. If all the words in the past newspapers were gathered together, they might not be inferior to a great work. Now that there is a 50% tax increase, the landlords and sublessors will naturally have something to do.</p>
<p>According to the survey in the previous month, the city's population has decreased from five million to five hundred thousand, and there are indeed more "for rent" signs everywhere, indicating that many people have already been squeezed dry and have escaped! (Are they returning to their occupied hometowns?) If they are squeezed further, another drop from four million is inevitable. Regardless of whether they return to the occupied areas, or hang themselves and starve to death, the fact that the houses will be empty is always a reality. At that time, the sublessors' "excuse" cannot be used to complain to the landlords, and the landlords will naturally have to pay empty taxes. Therefore, the increase must be frank and the distribution must be fair. Only by helping each other in the same boat can we reach the shore of victory. I hope you do not ignore this cliché.</p>
<h3>Shop Owner, Staff, Customer</h3>
<p>— Yu Bi</p>
<p>Three Parties' Interests at Stake</p>
<p>After reading Quan Jun's short article in this journal on the 15th, I had deep feelings. At first, I thought they were "putting on airs" and was often resentful in my heart; but since I joined a certain company, I realized why those shop assistants' faces often looked like "iron-faced Taoists." It turns out that they all came from apprenticeships and, after ten or eight years, their salaries are still only about twenty or thirty yuan, without food or lodging. The words "plain noodles" are often on their lips; some sleep in the shop, setting up their beds early in the morning and putting them away late at night, while others live with relatives and friends, saving every penny to barely get by. Their state of mind is naturally not good. A bad state of mind also affects the politeness they should have towards customers.</p>
<p>Wise bosses, if you want to improve your business, you certainly cannot ignore the politeness of the shop assistants towards the customers; but if you improve the treatment so that they can work with peace of mind, they will also automatically pay attention to politeness towards customers. How can you make them work with peace of mind? The methods are described roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Provide accommodation for shop assistants, and there must be a fixed place.</p>
<p>(2) Provide full board, not just lunch, or no board at all.</p>
<p>(3) The monthly salary should be discussed after deducting food and lodging.</p>
<p>(4) Calculate the cost of living every three to four months and add a discretionary allowance.</p>
<p>(5) If the shop has a surplus at the end of the year, a bonus should be given according to the amount earned, if the amount is ten months. Old employees with service achievements and excellent performance should be given a bonus.</p>
<p>(7) Shop assistants should have the opportunity to recuperate and enjoy normal entertainment. If they attend school or participate in pure professional organizations, the shop should subsidize all or part of the tuition or membership fees.</p>
<p>(8) If shop assistants have family burdens, there should be special remedies.</p>
<p>The above is just a rough description of what I have seen and heard. Wise bosses, if you can do all or most of these things, the shop assistants will not feel pain in their minds and bodies, and they will feel that the success or failure of the shop is closely related to them, so they will naturally be dedicated to their work and polite to customers.</p>
<p>Wise bosses, please look further ahead.</p>
<h3>Egg Yolks are Easy to Digest</h3>
<p>Letter from Dr. Wang Yugang</p>
<p>(The above is omitted) The common perception of eating eggs is that egg whites are easy to digest and nutritious, while egg yolks are suffocating and not nutritious. Therefore, even patients who can eat eggs often eat egg whites and discard egg yolks. This is actually the opposite of what is known in theory and in practice. According to chemical analysis, egg yolks, in addition to pure protein, contain sulfur, fat, and mineral complex compounds (market-popular flecks are extracted from them). Compared to pure protein, they have greater nutritional value and are easier to digest. Therefore, from the perspective of scientific principles, for patients who can be nourished by eggs, the egg white should be discarded and only the egg yolk should be given to them. If this is the case for patients, then the nutritional value of egg yolk for healthy people is even more beneficial.</p>
<h3>Beware of Being Cheated Out of Delivery Fees</h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>The business of making money by war is almost everywhere. Even the delivery fees for litigation documents in the court are being counterfeited to cheat people out of money. Therefore, I am writing about the situation of my family being cheated, so that people who have not been cheated can take precautions.</p>
<p>At about 1:00 PM on Saturday, a so-called "bailiff" came with a briefcase and asked as soon as he entered the door, "Is this so-and-so? Is so-and-so here?" He then took out a stack of court summons and other documents from his bag, took out one, and asked, "The court has ordered the delivery, and the delivery fee is six cents, two cents for the transportation fee, and four cents to be handed over to the court." The family members saw that he was from the court, and his words were sincere and his clothes were neat, so they naturally did not suspect that he was fake and paid him. He took it and said, "Wait in court early on a certain day, don't be late. Goodbye!" And left.</p>
<p>When I came home in the evening, I took one look at this summons-like paper and knew something was wrong. Because the paper was just a few sentences written casually, without the court's seal, and without the name seal of the judge or clerk, only the four words "Bailiff's Seal" were written at the bottom, and it was not named. The most striking thing was that the words "Bailiff's Delivery Fee" and "Shanghai First Special Zone Local Court" were cut out from other documents. When I checked the date on the calendar, it was a Sunday, and my case had already ended in mid-July last year. I thought to myself, "There is no need for the court to investigate again; even if there is another inquiry, it wouldn't be without a seal, would it? Isn't this a forgery?" But the case number and name written on it are indeed the same as mine, so I suspect that this was done by someone familiar with the inside situation.</p>
<p>I am writing about what happened to give a warning to the general public who have not been deceived, so that they will not pay a nameless loss in vain again, and so that he will not dare to try again.</p>
<h3>Fine Weather After Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 23: Old Friends and New Companions, Literature Has Value, Famous Scenic Spots Can Be Controlled</p>
<p>Because the current use is more for use, and the art of photography has also progressed further. Recently, it is not popular to use large cameras, but only small ones. Small cameras are favored for their lightness and portability, and when folded, they can be safely tucked into a pocket. Because the lenses are good and the manufacturing is precise, even if they are extremely small, enlargements are flawless. Some even say that cameras are installed in coat linings or on the waistbands of suits, so that by simply opening the outer clothes and flicking a finger, a person can be photographed. That is only for detectives who need to catch people off guard to take pictures. Otherwise, taking a photo should be done with the person's consent, as it is a social courtesy. However, people rarely disagree with being photographed, as photography is now as common as tea and rice in modern life. Especially in newspapers, illustrations and text are equally important. If you open a newspaper and there are no illustrations at all, it is dull and uninteresting. Therefore, all field reporters have very sophisticated cameras. Some are equipped by the newspaper, and some belong to the field reporters themselves, like Shao Huihua, who has several cameras. There is also a special thing in the newspaper, which is the so-called electronic transmission of photos. They have a portable electronic transmitter. Whenever a reporter goes out and takes such a portable transmitter, as long as she is within a thousand kilometers and there is a telegraph office, she can turn on the portable transmitter, connect it to the telegraph line, and send it to the newspaper. Imagine how convenient this is. When the newspaper receives the photos they sent, it can immediately make a plate and print it in the newspaper. Now let’s talk about the female technician. After taking a photo with them, Shao Huihua said, "Sister Danyu should have a special photo taken because you are a newlywed." Jin Danyu was a little unconvinced and said, "Why should I have a special photo taken? You still have that kind of feudal thinking." Qu Wushuang came out to mediate and said, "Not only Sister Danyu, but all the sisters should have a special photo taken. Sister Airen is a star in our female medical community. She is dedicated to the cause of midwifery and infant care. We admire her very much and should take two extra photos. The two He sisters are the most progressive textile industrialists. You should especially take two more photos. I suggest that you first take a group photo and then take two separate photos. Because you are so similar that if you two are not wearing different colored clothes, it is really confusing. Let's see if there are such similar sisters in a group photo. In two separate photos, because no matter how similar, there is always a slight difference. We will carefully distinguish the differences and where they are." (267)</p>
<h3>Being a Son of God (3)</h3>
<p>Contact with the personality and spirit of Jesus can also give us such encouragement and power, but the difference is that Jesus shows us the value of destiny, not in how it was in the past, nor in how it is now, but in the infinite achievements of the future. Therefore, it is not enough to have our minds filled with noble thoughts, dreams, and plans for a while. Aspiring to spiritual progress for a while is one thing. Continuing to strive for progress every day is another. The essence of Christianity is to enable people to have the enthusiasm and ability to be sons of God, and to do their best, as opportunities allow, to be instruments of God and transform this world. Therefore, we must ask ourselves, what is in our minds now? What are we striving for every day? What is the value and goal of life? Jesus is the Son of God, but he is also a model. We can also have the spirit of Jesus. This is what we believe. For this reason, we must open our hearts and receive His spirit. Everyone can be a son of God. If we all lived like sons of God, what would the world be like? We must measure people by their future achievements. People work not for personal gain, but for the future development of their work. The value of a person's life is not in his past background, nor in his current wealth, but in the future development obtained from his own creation and willpower. This is the basic goal of being human. The word "limited" should not exist in people. There should only be a strong will and continuous effort. Only when society is saturated with such motivation can there be a new and admirable culture. For two thousand years, people of all kinds have come to Jesus and received the power to become children of God. Like them, we should move forward and never give up. We should have courage and go forward to obtain peace and personal power. As long as we are willing to do this great crusade, our character can be fully developed and infinitely advanced. End</p>

<h3>New Trends in Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Hollywood film critics are revealing the slogan "Year of Mystery" for this year. According to the speculation of beauty authority Frank Victor, the "Ooh Girl" style that was popular last year will become outdated this year and no one will care about it. Fans will no longer admire "sexiness" but will welcome a natural and fresh atmosphere, with a mysterious style. This will be fully performed in the film "Miss America of 194-".</p>
<p>Many stars who have been in retirement for a while will make a comeback this year. The most popular is the comedian Charlie Chaplin. He will have two or more new films released this year. With his broad satire and smile, he will be repeatedly recognized as the leading artist of the silver screen. Second, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich may be very active.</p>
<p>In this mysterious year, the four young men who are admired for their romance will undoubtedly have fierce competition. Clark Gable will inevitably compete with Taylor Power to maintain the "highest grossing record." Robert Taylor made three films in a row last year with surprisingly poor box office results. This year, he had to create a new style. Charles Boyer, after returning to France to join the army for a while, has recently returned to Hollywood. Women will definitely expect a new stimulus from his heroism.</p>
<p>Among the actresses, Bette Davis, who won the throne last year, will continue to maintain her unwavering record. As for those child stars, such as Shirley Temple, Deanna Durbin, Gloria Jean, and Mickey Rooney, although they may not be able to create a special style, their liveliness and beauty will be as exciting as Chaplin and Garbo.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Pianists' Skills</h3>
<p>— Ke Yunlou Master</p>
<p>Xu Lanyuan - The tone is clear and melodious, and the reasoning is correct. His and Wang Shaoqing's creation of the Mei school of piano accompaniment was a sensation. The tunes he played seem ordinary on the surface, but they are quite strict in handling and never slacken. It is difficult to start without long-term cultivation. In the film "Life and Death Hate," following Wan Hua's graceful singing, rising and falling together, he has a unique style when closing the voice and looking around, with ingenious originality, pleasing to the ear, and a sense of leisurely yearning. However, he often likes to deliberately lengthen the tone between "Gong-Chi" to show off his ability, which is a flaw.</p>
<p>Mu Tiefen - His wrist strength is outstanding, and his finger tone is strong. He can compete with Zhu Zuo Chen Yanheng. His piano style has not changed slightly in the past ten years. Occasionally, in order to suit the current fashion, he slightly showed his "transformation" in the "Wild Mountain Tears" recording by Zuo Yushuang, but the rhythm is still complete. The "small interlude" is drawn out拍拍. Recently, he still maintains a consistent style and never dabbles in flowery tricks to follow the fashion. People admire him very much. This time, I listened to dozens of performances and felt that his tone was too low and could not test his sharpness. According to his piano tone, it is most suitable for the "B" character, but now it cannot be fulfilled because of the restriction of E Yun; and he follows the tune everywhere, unable to do what he wants. He only shows his skills slightly when playing the "large interlude," which is extremely limited. Occasionally, in this play, I listen to the clear performance of "Crying Emperor Heaven" and other songs, but only for a moment. The high-pitched tone and the rhythm of tearing silk are completely missing, which is disappointing.</p>
<p>Yang Baozhong - Baozhong is also a self-taught musician, the same as Hongshou. He has a unique and outstanding finger tone among the piano accompanists for old male roles, and can be regarded as a leading figure. When he assisted Wen Ru, his playing tended to be "transformed," as if he had lost the original purpose of practicing the piano. He is an elder who has experienced many masters. Wen Ru's melody is clever and often has no fixed place, while Baozhong moves from chaos to tranquility. In the "transformation" of the piano, he does not lose his correctness and highly regards the format of the piano (the piano of Yan San, who learns his chaos, cannot get it right. Although the appearance is the same, it is extremely difficult to listen to). Therefore, studying his piano style is not suitable for Wen He, and now it has been heard that they have split up. But it is also difficult for him to cooperate with his younger brother Baosen, because the singing and playing are different, how can he achieve this excellent state?</p>
<p>Chen Hongshou - Hongshou originally studied old male roles, but after his voice deteriorated, he assisted Wang Shaolou on the piano. Shaolou's singing tone was low and hoarse, but Hongshou was able to show off his skills in a cramped tone; and the rhythm was clear, meticulous, and the tone was quiet and melodious, showing the mystery of his support of the singing. It can be heard that Shaolou's record tone is close to the word "climb," but it is widely welcomed and sells well both in the north and south. This is not because his singing is directly appealing, but because it is easy for people to learn. And Hongshou's skill also accounts for half of it.</p>
<h3>Advice to Fans from Movie Stars</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Maureen O'Sullivan: "Don't think that appearing on the screen is an easy task; an actor without education will be laughed at everywhere; and it is even more important to have careful preparation before appearing on the screen."</p>
<p>Paulette Goddard: "Your attitude towards us actors should be one of kind care; unwarranted harassment is unacceptable; otherwise, our work will be greatly affected. Because I don't like to interact with the outside world, you have given me the nickname of 'Mysterious Girl.' This phenomenon completely disrespects my personality."</p>
<p>Dorothy Lamour: "In your eyes, you must think that the lives of stars are always extremely luxurious and comfortable; this concept is completely wrong. Before I entered the film industry, I worked as an elevator operator in a company in New York. The life at that time was truly unbearable for ordinary people. So now, although the income is enough for me to enjoy a comfortable life, I can't help but feel shabby when I think of the conditions of the past."</p>
<p>Lionel Barrymore: "I am now old and faded, but my career on the screen and on the stage is almost sixty years. From my experience, I know that the most important thing to hope that a young artist can continue to improve is to give him correct criticism in many ways. If the audience only knows how to praise blindly or support carelessly, it is tantamount to letting him step into the path of ruin."</p>
<p>Janet Gaynor: "Fans have a common goal, which is to hope that the productions of stars who already have a high status or superb acting skills can be better. This cannot be achieved because there is one reason: first, their energy is as limited as ordinary people. Second, because they already have a high status or superb acting skills, they cannot perfunctorily deal with each of their productions and ruin their reputation. In this way, the time spent in production is of course incomparable to that of ordinary productions, so there cannot be a large number of productions."</p>

<h3>Zhou Jianyun Recognizes New Talents</h3>
<p>— Yi Xing</p>
<p>Zhou Jianyun's establishment of a new company has now become concrete. However, directors and actors are a rather serious problem. Not long ago, someone recommended Jin Suqin to Zhou to star in "Wen Ji Returns to Han." Whether it will be completed is currently unknown. However, Zhou discovered a young girl named Qiao Qiao in the Zhong Theater Company's performance of "Peach Blossom Spring." She is only fifteen years old and grew up in Beiping. Her Mandarin is naturally fluent and unparalleled, and her acting is even more talented. When she sings, her voice is sweet and pleasant. According to reporters, Qiao Qiao's real name is Wang Qiaoyu. She is currently studying at Qingxin Girls' High School. Because she loves drama, she occasionally makes a cameo appearance. As for filming, I wonder if her family will allow it?</p>
<p>Chen Yuelou, the chairman of the Shanghai Actors' Joint Association, has recently been persuaded by several representatives repeatedly, taking the overall situation of the Actors' Association as the most important thing. He politely agreed to reluctantly take on the role. However, before resuming his position, there is one condition: we must work together to recover the houses and properties in Liyuanfang.</p>
<h3>A Demonstration Work of the British Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Jing Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, the British government completed the production of two demonstration works:</p>
<p>One is: "Crisis in the Pacific," which puts Japan's policies in the Far East, the defense of Hong Kong Singapore, and the naval power of the US Pacific outpost Guam on the screen one by one. And General Yarnall, former commander of the US Asian Fleet, narrated the recent real situation of the Chinese war, and there is also considerable description of the heroic combat of the Chinese soldiers. The material of the whole film is completely cut and pieced together from news films and completed with the most meticulous and complex production procedures.</p>
<p>There is also: "Cavalcade of the Navy"; which describes the history and development of the navy in detail. The whole film begins with the naval situation in ancient Phoenicia and Rome and continues to the current British navy. Finally, the vast lineup of the British Navy is displayed on the screen. The purpose of its production is, on the one hand, to give its own people a deeper understanding, and on the other hand, of course, to make a demonstration to the enemy!</p>
