<h3>工商界如何處變</h3>
<p>處擾攘之世，憂危橫於前，利害動於中，理智失其常，善惡是非有不暇檢矣。但善者終不失其爲善，是者終不失其爲是，昔有懷疑法幣之前途者，而今法幣仍爲最能普遍最獲信任之通貨，固爲衆所共認也；更推想之於今後，法幣處境無論如何之困難，終見其永爲金剛不壞之身，雖有詆毀之者，破壞之者，無損於其本質也。然則有資力者固無所用其恐懼，亦無所用其猶豫，若乃因懷疑之而輕事投機，徒見其爲自毀而已。原投機者，賭博之行徑也，有盈必有虧，盈虧無常，成敗不一。若以爲此而可恃，則投機之根本性質固氷山也：若明知其爲不可恃，則何爲而以身家作孤注！遑論投機，凡事一時之利害，不足爲利害，惟遠大之目光，始有其價值。一隅之得失，不足爲得失，惟最後之成功，方爲眞正之勝利。故今之徘徊於買賣之塲，終日提心吊膽於利害關頭者，亟宜作退一步想，母以爲市塲必漲落之不已，永予投機者以盤旋擒縱之機會；要知世變不常，行見驚波駭浪之或猝至；此其反動，雖一瀉千里未可知也。</p>
<p>透澈言之，立國當世，經濟上無可閉關自守而對國無所依存：今日與今後之中國經濟則與抗戰相依爲命；抗戰勝利之日，即經濟欣榮之時。蓋戰爭對於國民經濟之種因與後果，關聯深切，影響錯綜，茲不克細陳；但念對於國際之脈絡相通，休戚攸共，則與中國國民經濟痛癢相關之諸友國，誰願中國三年抗戰之功，廢於一旦而付東流乎？自往昔而至今後，予中國以援助者，實屬自利利華，無不以兩利之原則爲之基礎，互利之籌算爲之動因者也。事固不但對華若是而已，美國之援英，固爲正義計，亦自爲計，不如此，蓋大西洋之藩籬盡撒矣。美國決援華，援華固不自今始，惟有罣礙故，援助不見其積極。然而此後如何，瓊斯之言可耐味也。無論其爲五千萬也，一萬萬也，只要中國有辦法，美國當不至有所恡。因之，在中國繼續抗戰之時期之中，無論時期之如何悠久，雖中國經濟狀况臻於極度困難，自在意中，然絕對不致陷於毫無辦法之絕境，此則可以斷言。勝利原來必須千辛萬苦以致之；所爭者。此辛苦而不絕如縷，彼以國際之封鎖日益加緊而先陷於崩潰，此則多助與無助之辨。亦勝敗之所由判也。天之將曙也，黑暗粥甚；暴雨之將逝也，點滴愈大；</p>
<p>上海未來之處境，或將類似飲。然而何翟；工商各界茍欲自免於損失，幸母自投陷阱。蓋戰事如擴大，彼其費用愈繁，搜刮愈甚，必將以種種籍口，種種方式，加緊榨取；益以從中趁火打劫，乘機漁利者，實繁有徒；於是正當工商業必大受其累、乃至無法立足，終爲所鯨吞遠食。抑酋無待乎方來，即以目　而論，營生於租界之內者，表面雖未遭鉗制，然如貨物之出入，概與淪陷區工商界同其遭遇，如粉廠之麥，紗廠之棉、米店之米，（目前除洋米外）甚至於蔬菜魚肉，似乎來源不絕，要非封鎖之寬宏，實皆厭榨之餘歷也。若所謂苛捐雜稅，橫征暴斂，皆中國固有之文辭，然考其酷虐程度，則中國歷史所未有也。於今爲烈矣，又焉知爾後不因日暮途窮而變本加厲，使租界內遭受更酷更虐耶！來日大難，市人固應預先體認明白∼。母以爲意外打擊，務作忍受萬般摧殘，忍挨萬般苦楚之準備；夷然處之，以迄光明之來臨。倒行逆施者，必落沒不遠，天理也，至理也。</p>
<p>以言金融，先所覬覦者必爲貨幣，但就「聯鈔」之經驗，日本恐不願自尋煩惱，而採取同樣行動，但亦必思與之發生聯帶關係。幣制問題原極艱鉅，斷非空口所得頤使，斷非高壓所得支配，故紙上籌謀，決知其必難有濟。蓋欲摧毀根深蒂固之法幣、非旦夕間事，如欲假借歲月、則歲月固最不容壟斷而爲彼所共者也。此係經濟戰爭才陣地戰、以戰略相周旋，以實力決勝負、中外人士其必深信法幣實力之渾厚爲何如，勝負寗待卜之異日耶？以言外匯、外匯實操於英美之手、是無可諱言。上海之所以有今日之匯市，正緣英美商人當時拘拘於近利、處處存綏靖之想、而不作澈底解決之計耳。此後之英美商人，亦當具破釜沉舟之勇氣，不但就戰事上亦當就金融上，一決高低，則外匯之前途，勢必更有利於自由之中國也明甚。</p>
<p>總之，工商界務須勉抑一時之衝動，賓斥離奇之謠言，善持鎮靜，母自尋煩惱。不觀天津禁用法幣之後，而法幣之值反上漲，蓋爲所通行之貨幣無準備，故在國際匯兌上小發生價值，對外出入，仍維法幣是求。由可知法幣實力之渾厚，決非虛語，何况英美之金鎊金圓，在政策上必予法幣以必要之支持耶。</p>

<h3>倫敦人的地下生活</h3>
<p>葛萊納：「我坐在地室中蓆子上，靠着枕頭，正在傾聽安放在膝蓋上的無綫電九時新聞節目報告，忽然來了一陣震耳欲聾的爆炸聲，我以爲我是必死無疑的了。我能聽到四週都是坍倒房屋的聲音，尤其是我的屋子頂上，一霎間，地室天花板震動了，上面的泥土粉　，剝落下墜於地。我心中想整個的屋子要坍倒了，在我未能逃出去之前，一定都要坍塌在我頭頂上哩。我尤深信米奇和管家婆兩人，不是死去便字機和紙張，還記得聽到管家已受了重傷。幾秒鐘之內，我婆在電話中對她丈夫說道。。「因受震過甚，一些動彈不得，我們的屋子出事了。我非得離繼而我想起還是把鋼盔戴上的開去不可。」在她還沒有把聽好，但因方寸已亂，一時間竟筒放上之前，轟的第二爆炸聲也找不着它。突然間我發現這又來了。一陣大風吹進窗子，鋼盔一直執在我手中。在沒有把懸在窗前防禦空襲用的遮光上樓之前，我決計先把地窖的紙，直裹捲在我身上，我則站兩個出口檢視一下，如這屋子立不穩，仰跌入廚房，一屁股的上半部已在搖搖欲墮，或已撞在茶水壺上，正跌落在葛萊經着了火的話，我一定先要準納所愛的小犬身上。管家婆被備好能逃出這個地窖。這底層風直捲淮餐室，因爲起居室中的前面一扇門緊閉着，我沒有的大窗門已被震落地，電氣爐　匙可以把鎖開啟。我便奔向也被直擲至房子他端的書　中後門，但是當我把門開默之時。我匍匐羞從地上爬了起來，，灰塵直撲我面，炸彈爆發後奔進餐室，把管家婆拖回廚房之烟氣硝磺幾乎把我弄得窒息，使她平臥在地板上，得以安。我把門砰然閉上，直奔上樓全些。我想我們一切完了。地，心想最壞的事情一定遭遇到板，磚塊和玻璃受爆震之後，了。我用力扭開直通大扶梯甬直飛空中而去，又從窗子屋頂道的那扇門。喊着「亞倫……上墮落下來，一股股的烟和炸海倫」男女兩人的名字。「我彈的火藥氣，直捲入房子裏。們都平安着」。這幾個甜蜜的在無可如何之中，震炸之聲忽答語，可說我耳朶中從來未曾然停頓了，我從黑暗裏聽得葛聽到過呀。」萊納的呼喊聲。</p>
<p>米奇：「我換着了舊褲子葛萊納：「我們決計跑到，羊毛彩，和皮馬夾，正站在外面去看看怎樣情形。大門已四層樓的浴室中，忽然間，旣經敞直的開着，鉸鏈飛去，門沒颼的一聲警告之聲，房子前上所裝耶爾鎖的鋼框子亦已震面的廣塲上發生極可怕的爆炸掉。我們步出門廊，走下階級。整偭的屋子在那里搖擺着，，看見有一堆鐵質殘骸。我們我呆若木鷄一動都不動。腦筋把手電筒照射窺視，不禁大家中雖然儘管命我急速下樓，可同聲喊道：是「架飛機」一是我還堅持着各種機械動作，些也不錯。這是德國容克斯轟冲洗厠缸，扣褲子紐，關閉浴炸機的鐵骨碎架，大約有一具室中電燈，最後纔跑下三層樓棺材那樣大小。那殘骸，望上去。我在客廳的檯子上搶了打去好像一輛汽車被火車撞毀後的景象。忽聽得廣塲中間花園內有一個婦女哭喊的聲音，米奇聞聲衛往對街去帮助她，管家婆及我則返入大門，躱避空中落下來的子彈碎片。」</p>
<p>米奇：「我一步一躓穿入花園，看見一個嚇昏了的婦人，在園子中間我不到公共防空室的門口。她訴說道，她剛纔在三間門面之外的屋子轉角上，就是德機爆裂之處走過，倖免於難。其中一枚炸彈在德機飛過這廣塲時爆炸。另外一枚下去時，這德機也就自己爆炸而落在房子頂上了。我那時也嚇昏了，不領她到公共防空室去，反把她帶過對街，朝她已經遭殃的家裏走，那時她所住的屋子和幾間鄰屋都在熾烈燒燃之中。我記起弄錯r事情，就把她導至公共防空室。走園門時，叉遇到穿着寢衣，瑟縮在毯子裏的兩個婦女，我引導他們三人一同步入防空室。事畢奔返自己的家。看見階級上有德機的殘骸，決計要把它收拾起來，作爲夜間遭殃的紀念品。因之葛萊格和我很小心地把戈林的一點小小禮物搬運到客廳之中。」</p>
<p>葛萊納：「數分鐘後，我們又重聚在地窖之中。不多一會子，我們大家同意，因爲在這火燒的目標附近，德機所投的炸彈已不在少數，飛機的殘骸中當尚藏着未爆炸的定時炸彈。也許我們所住的屋子，立刻就會被炸起來，在此種種危險之下，我們急不及待的就要設法離開此屋。我們並沒有停留收拾仟何東西，米奇和我並巳硬着心腸最好不把愛尤帶走。但是管家婆請求我們帶這小犬一同去，因之我們又禽上樓梯把狗牽了下來。走不多遠，看見街道h滿佈碎玻璃片和斷垣殘木之類，我們只好把小犬抱在懷中了。」</p>
<p>米奇：「我們蹣跚着沿着街道，向火車站的方向前進，希望在那裹找到一輛街車。熊熊的火光之下，我們可以看到一羣羣的居民，從他們住所的地室中奔出來，向廣塲中沒有受損的公共防空壕而去。有些人却毫無希望似的站立在門口，不知還是冒險穿過街道的好呢，還是停滯在他們受威脅的屋子中好。在往車站的半途中，在我們所立的附近街道轉角上，忽來了一道紅光，照耀如同白畫。我從經驗上已知有怎樣的事情要發生了。正當炸彈爆發之頃，我們把身子蹲伏在一所鋼骨水泥屋子的鬥口。在兩家門面之外，炸彈正中了那所屋子，所幸係在轉角上，那陣風沒有吹到我們身上。我們趕　拔步向前，在車站門前見到一輛孤零零的汽車，那車夫倒願意冒險開我們到杜乞期脫旅館去。我們眞不禁要和他握手。一</p>
<p>葛萊納：「旅館的串堂裏擁滿了社會上要人和各國外交官。倫敦的大人物和半大亨都不庸似的朝着我們看，以爲我們是從集中營來的避難者。當我們在酒排間中飲酒的時候，我的手無意之間伸入口袋，好像在受催眠似的手勢中，拖出一隻茶杯，我也記不起是從家裹拿出來的，但是我一定在無意識之中，在離開防空壕前拖它塞進了袋中，毫無疑義。生活雜認攝影員范迪佛和他的夫人也住在這旅館中，他們因爲原來住的地方鄰近有定時炸彈，故而他們就搬了出來。他們夫婦倆共同參加慶祝我們脫險。（完）</p>

<h3>糧食　粳米阻撓入租界　謠逐鼓勵米囤戶　洋米漲一二元藥種漲四五元　俱爲時局所造成的惡劣環境</h3>
<p>今明將有大宗洋米到滬</p>
<p>洋米昨日市况、曾有絕大之風浪、早市被「南京承認」問題、引起業內外有錢份子之儘量吸收、蓋謂法幣將有問題、形欲以盡購食米、此則不祇威脅平民生計、且似與平民宣戰矣、繼傳國米被阻、粳糯騰漲、洋米囤胃愈貪、價乃被皮球着着踢高、越抬越昂、各檔現洋米盡被抬起一元餘至二元、洋糯米受國糯影響、尤見挺俏、一號西貢原包英華司前日開出九十元後、雖有九十一元之喊聲、而未有成交、昨乃自九十二元半、漲至九十三元、十二月份價爲九十二元、二號現貨爲八十九元、十二月份爲九十六元半、較之前日漲起二三元、然至下午市塲中巳有透露米商直接向緬滇訂購數千噸外、市上公布者亦有日興洋行小紋一月份一千噸成交、價爲八十一元、市面至此頓難支持、十二月份一號西貢在上午開九十二元者、下午立卽降至九十元矣、其他各米均喊低一二元不等、卽各檔現米亦均瀉跌一元至元外、結果現洋米祇比前晚較大半元左右而已、惟期洋米拋貨者堅持、大部份不肯賤脫、且市上流通籌碼不多、故成交不足五百噸、而現貨被業外大戶吸收、成交不下二萬包、計做開一號西貢七十八元、二號七十四元八角、次至七十三元、火绞七十七兀至七十四元、二號暹羅七十二兀半、至七十一元半、小絞七十一元八角、至七十一元半、米菉六十六元至六十四元、碎尖六十二元半、至六十元、蕪湖尖六十九元至六十八元半、</p>
<p>新粳尖及茶植等來源、因界外被阻、到貨告絕、致一般貨主中扳俏異常、而店家作客、爲恐向隅、遂亦不問價高與否、羣相爭辦、緣如藥種暴漲四五．兀之巨、開原包九十元零五角、至九十元、斛見八十八元、至八十六元半、新粳亦好一二元、普通原包開出九十五元、惟杜洋尖悉屬乏貨無市、</p>
<p>糯米際此佳境、相隨挺秀、小獨飯擔酒戶去路頗旺、且大戶繼在收囤、故價亦見漲一二元不等官溧特兀已售至九十元中關亦須八十八兀、香港白元七十九兀、次至七十六元、糯茶六上六元至六十四元半、</p>
<p>今日有大批洋米到滬、法輪羅斯（Paos）號、由西買直接運來洋米一千六百噸、又（Albert　SarTant）號華綸洋行經理、計裝洋米三千噸、依照原定船期、應於咋日到埠、但至晚尚無消息、據該公司稱、大約今日可到滬、恰和洋行、永生輪、太古公司嘉輪輪、係由香港載洋米來滬、約今日亦可進口、（祖）</p>
<h3>澳粉路貨拋售</h3>
<p>本粉街銷限八千包</p>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉交易、頗形活絡、但均以洋粉爲主品、蓋因華廠粉每日限制供給本街八千包數額、非指定經售粉號、不易購得、所以洋粉最爲本街所注意、聞第二批定粉新到三萬餘包、正在起卸、該貨大都預先售出、其十二月初將到之澳粉、連日逐將路貨拋售、本街與客囤陸續吸收、鐘樓花烏牌等′均已昂至十八元八角、成交約計三千包、美國洋粉福壽牌價叩二十元關、高鮮貨價十九元八角至十九元二三角，市面日趨索俏、</p>
<p>小麥　咋日來源、仍有蘇崑等處略釗二三百包、均係解送日廠、華廠進胃雖貪、仍以無貨可收爲憾、聞市上高杜麥索價二十九元、但爲數不多、尚無相當受主、洋麥定貨、亦尚在醞釀中、</p>
<h3>油餅　豆油期貨已拋開</h3>
<p>昨日油市因賣買兩感乏與、致市面無甚h落、惟大連豆油已由前所組織之調劑份子、在市塲中拋售、因乃試探性質、爲數尚尠、大局亦未受若何影響、統計成交大連豆油二十桶、價爲1百零三元、訂一月份交一百桶、價爲九十九元、三百五十桶價爲一百元、烟岐豆油三十件、價爲七十四元五角大有廠豆油一百担、價爲八十元、膠州生油一百件、價爲七十四元七角半至七十四元、靑島生油二十桶、價爲一百零三元、訂十二月下交七百桶、價爲一百零四元七角半至一百零四元、</p>
<h3>金融　日美商拋出　外匯由緊轉平穩</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、悉無上落、英美滙暗市、潛勢遠期一度頗緊、此以投機商多數仍傾向扒納、加之港電1後市來結、買風又减、惟美行日行供意不怠、尤以日行三井晨初賤售、市面由軟轉硬、至晚收結果英美兩滙、均告平定、</p>
<h3>投機商傾向買進</h3>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌　對美滬等均平、美對英不動、對滬跌五分、對法無市、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三便士七一八七五、美滙五八一二五、與上日晚收價同、開後一度呈鬆、乃日行來出、計外行吸入本月份美匯五元八四三七五稍頃投機家力購、市面轉堅、計下月份外行售價由五元八一二五、以至七五滙　掛牌揭亮勿變、白銀平衡稅亦無上落、嗣因投機商回吐、勢略告便、下月份投機商出外行由五元七八一二五達八四三七五更有日行三井拋售甚暢、計十二月份外行吃入俱爲五元八四三七五、迄午收投機商亦結得十二月份美五元八四三七五、收盤現貨英金價三便士七一八七五、美滙五元八四三七五、比晨開英平、美長〇三一二五、</p>
<h3>英美收盤無上落</h3>
<p>後市爲狀軟化、此因港電豁要、投機商扒納續旺、惟美行等肯結、價尚平穩、初沙遜外行現先令三便士七一八七五、後港電投機商入美行外行下月份美匯一致五元八一二五、晚收期現英金三便士七一八七五、美滙五元八一二五、與上日價軒輊不分、</p>
<h3>香港英平美亦穩</h3>
<p>香港什九日（週五）電、今晨滙市開盤告半、英滬　期貨及日滙現貨均無上落、美滙現貨緊〇六二五、爲二十三元四三七五、申滙現貨升五元半、爲四百〇三元半、十時正申滙現貨回降一元半、爲四百〇一元、十時十五分告平、美滙現貨回硬〇六二五、爲二十三元半、申　現貨續降一元、爲四百〇一元、十一時三十分告平、各滙概無變動、下午二時三十分告半、申匯現貨重升五角、爲四百〇一元五角、其餘不動、</p>
<h3>天津匯價俱見縮</h3>
<p>天津廿九日（週五）電、今晨匯市開盤告平、倫敦電匯緊〇三一二五、爲四便士、紐約電滙緊〇六二五、爲六元二八一二五、申滙升六角、爲九十二元六角、「聯鈔」暗稱不動、仍爲八十六元五角、</p>
<h3>經濟業談（一）  馮柳堂</h3>
<p>雅片</p>
<p>談到雅片，人人知這是貴弱中國的最大害，可是中國人眞是不怕死，從「檢火」之上用功夫，至今還是流連着。</p>
<p>這裏不要談雅片是怎樣將人，只略談雅片一些故事。現在吸雅片的老者尚多，作者生平未嘗有雅片入口，所談畢竟是門外漢，所以不周到地方，還請指敎。</p>
<p>雅片是譯名，從Opoum轉譯而來。何時始入中國，渺茫不可考。可是童時見前人某筆記載，明萬曆間巳有流入，有謂明神宗（萬歷）爲了鴻臚寺卿李可灼進紅丸而崩，這紅丸內中就舍了雅片緣故。一仙人難識丸丹事」，何況是宮　中的丸丹，更是無從講起了，權且不談。</p>
<p>雅片在中國，大約乾隆末年已見流行了。因爲這時候的中國，眞所謂鼓舞昇平的黃金時代，文酣武嬉，穹奢絕慾，那種消閒提神的物品，正是投其所好，何次父是英人勢力東漸的時候，東印度公司在印度獲得孟加拉諸地，英人通商巳到了寗波，其後雖行禁止，可是英人爲求通商而使馬戞爾尼至淸廷。到了嘉慶初年，就看見禁吸雅片的上諭，那可知吸食雅片已多，才會禁止呢！</p>
<p>雅片戰爭，在英國通商的目的上，不算一回事；可是在他文明上，畢竟留一污點。作者嘗謂雅片戰爭是白銀戰爭，數年前爲白銀問題，頗思有此作，後來終於不爲，蓋年來非必要不勸筆，這幾天又爲經濟業談，爲了留作補白之用。</p>
<p>何以知是白銀戰爭，這不難就當時的　荒銀貴情形可知。因爲　雅片須用白艱，吃雅片的人愈多，白銀流出愈盛，可是幾次敗仗的結果，雅片不曾禁止，反如水銀瀉地鉀孔不入，百餘年來猶未肅清，飲鴆止渴，大堪傷心。</p>
<p>雅片因爲是從外洋輸入，所以是廣帮經營居多，尤其是潮汕等地人。普遍則稱之爲土，土之爲義如何，有人說，罌栗鍊成漿，以土相和，而後出售；亦有謂大土爲圓形，如中國人所傳太歲神之土一，亦是滾圓一團，故名之曰土。大約以泥土之土爲近，蓋熬雅片烟，恒有籠頭渣據出。（未完）</p>
<h3>金市逢高不乏拋賣</h3>
<p>昨日金市烚赤暗市、爲開做第二屆現金期交來交易最後一日、勢隨美地盤旋、但晨開時則因某證券號不顧貴賤、竟來照開市價、須售出三百兩、致本可向上之勢、反見猛落至五千七百三十元低價、但外匯帶軟、故不久金號銀號爭來扒進、該號亦因所售之價過低、前來復進、價頓飛上至五千七百八十元、俄隨美匯下挫、至午刻重見盤上、下午又曾升見高價、後聞今晨掉期、買方須貼出五元左右、出籠之風較盛、故父盤下、終爲五千七百六十三元、軋小二十七元、全日交易五千兩光景、現金比期交價低二元、金號曾售予某銀樓數十兩，飾金關金等仍平、</p>
<h3>烚赤小念七元</h3>
<p>晨初不少多戶、準備高價脫手、因上日漲時巳晚、且某證券帮首售二三百兩、開盤告跌五六十元、計金號出錢兌業二十兩、爲五千七百三十元、以銀號帮乘低吸進升起五十元、計證券帮進銀號三十兩、五千七百八十元、惟金銀號又掀賣風、而斯時買方陣綫搖動、價遂挫落、錢兌業對做三十兩、祇五千七百三十六元、幸散戶等零星搜購、及賣戶稍减、漸見拉高〝計金號入銀號二十兩、告五千七百六十五元、迫至午收、亦有W千七百五十一元、後市其狀甚堅、乃外滙稍軟、證券帮突萌買意、最先撈入、計銀號沽予三十兩、五千七百六十元、續予二十兩、五千七百八十元、但未幾該帮某號等止進吐塞、交易似屬搶帽子性質、致銀號出錢兌業三十兩、五千七百五十五元、後仍挺上、是賴錢兌業買進、晚收前到五千七百七十三元、結果降十元、錢兌業入銀號二十兩、五千七百六十三元、比上日軋低二十七元、全日五十元上落、現金號之本牌金售價、較烚赤高十餘元、收進低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<h3>飾金依然不動</h3>
<p>銀樓飾金每兩兌出、始終不動、計大同有新同仃均懸五百九十尤、收　减低二十元光景、昨日外幣市况、烚赤市價致稍趨軟、英美金鎊卒跌五角、英金票供逾於求、亦跌五角、美金票始曾高至十七元三角一分、（開塲則曾做三角半）繼則退至七元零二分、卒爲十七元一角三分、比上日終低五分、香港票則升二分、日金票供求相將、晚市仍爲一元五角四分、朝鮮票需要感殷、市價繼續挺漲、晚市爲一元一角八分、</p>
<h3>證券　流言癃雜　內債交易轉平</h3>
<p>倫敦華債漲力仍強</p>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市極爲混沌謠言龐雜、利空利多莫衷一是、一方有美國繼續貸款之傅說甚盛、一方南京謠言又愈傳愈眞、同時並有發行金庫券之舊事重提、投機家處此五花八門之中、已失去共定力、故察者自空、多者自多、頗有無所遵從之概、公債行市、乃恍惚不寗、在最近二三日問、消息當可澄淸、昨日交易、鴻大·聯和·上午賣出、下午又買回·信孚·牛大·始終賣出、久孚同興·永和·五源、久豐·同康·上午買進、下午則無交易、順昌，信昌·三開，潤利·申一·於下午賣出甚湧、買賣各方均無確切目標、故市價亦浮沉不定、高低互見、結果祗五分與一角上落、成交約有一百七八＋萬元之謠、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交永安公司股票一百股、價爲十六元正、</p>
<p>又衆業公所股市、趨勢不定、價格波動極微、賣風雖比較爲盛、多方吸收亦力、收盤潛勢德定、橡皮股無前日之堅、但多方維持甚佳、咋日各股成交、按之本週交易之清閒、不能謂爲稀少、</p>
<p>倫敦二十八日（周四）電、今日中國外債及英商遠中各公司股票掛牌行市、華債善後借款（英發）再漲一鎊半、價爲二十六鎊半、其餘不動、又昨電隴海路債漲至十三鎊、係十一鎊、又京滬路價咋漲一鎊、爲十三鎊、係電碼遺漏遠東股票　有利銀行股h升二先令六便士、價爲十鎊七先令六便士、其餘亦無榮辱、</p>
<h3>紗花　年關前後　棉紗仍看在盤檔中</h3>
<p>紗市安定、趨勢較爲平靜、此因當日盛傳大鵬灣中之鯊漁涌口岸、曾一度被炸、人心虛怯、大都拋空看小、該處業已寗謐如常、貨運照常暢通、於是多頭心思轉佳、同時香港幫採辦進展、所以市面回好、不過有一部份看其在年關左右、仍在盤檔中、根本問題、還以實銷爲第一關鍵也、</p>
<p>雙馬晨開、因上日午後、黃金劇漲、而外匯綫縮、業外者購意濃密、因之跳高開盤、價爲一千二百二十五元、漲十元、此盤一開、然一般小銀號及小錢店都看匯票要縮、拖進甚夥、頃刻間漲至一千二百五十二元、但高價一現、獲利者吐出、頗不乏人、加之廣幫生意並不十分發達、同時外盤縮後又轉長、於是浮多出檔籌碼稍鬆、、跌至一千二百十八九元、收盤稍形回上、查牛日問成交統計四千九百八十包、行情二十支雙馬漲九元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<p>棉花廠商均觀望</p>
<p>現棉交易、華廠方面稍有也辦、但日廠始終無發展之望也、所以人心平席、但存棉雖日見减少、而來源不爽、銷路亦不能暢通、市面益呈趦趄狀態、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市靜寂、棉價先因海外商之賣出、續後則又因一部份之多頭了結、結果收盤價格、較之上日降四五磅音、印度棉市因政治原因、雖開市而無交易、預測價格、較之上日跌一羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來始終靜寂異常、各方供暫抱觀望態度、廠方購意淸淡、同業亦全無採購之意也、</p>
<h3>疋頭　棉布銷活躍　粵港辦最旺　售盤外弛內緊</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市趨勢良好、人氣亦佳、同業交易殊形踴躍、客路實銷粵港幫最旺、浙路溫台幫亦有採辦、售盤外弛內緊、蓋外埠布價昂貴、利潤極厚、惟運銷困難、滬市乃有供過於求、各價擯持、白貨漂染布均少軒輊、每疋抵一角至二角半上落、本街成交府綢及坯布、漂染布。絨布·等一千二百餘件、溫台幫辦粗細布漂染布二百餘件、粵港幫辦色布漂布府綢等三百餘件、北路烟台幫辦粗布等一百餘件、</p>
<p>東布　市氣堅定、升降範圍漸狹、蓋逢高有人賣出連跌則亦有人搜羅、白貨龍頭細布晨開三十五元四角、買戶談然，回至三十五元一二角、午市收盤又升至三十五元二角半、後市續升至三十五元三角半、因君子嗶嘰廻旋於八分左右、收盤價爲一元〇八分二厘半、</p>
<p>出口　棉布今日有一百五十件、運往夏門、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗車白俱升三四角</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外滙略縮轉緊、但所漲不多、僅三四角而已、公會劃盤現貨二四組白、本棧七十二元六角、外棧七十二元荷棉白BS嘜七十一元四角、荷赤現貨五十五元半、十二月十日打棧單五十五元九角、太古車日B嘜曲棧七十五元三角、DY及HX嘜　棧均六十八元四角、HM嘜西棧六十六元半、</p>
<h3>南北貨　排餅開出百包</h3>
<p>靑島排餅近到一批、除其中箱莊五十連、由裕生輪轉往香港外、尚有袋裝二百件、當開出一百件、四十六元、由本街幫分通、尚存百包、仍叫四十六元原價、尚未成交、或可稍鬆、市象穩固、</p>
<h3>五金　大馬口鐵開價昂貴　小馬口鐵實銷蠢動</h3>
<p>大馬口鐵　銷路以銷廠滾筒作、以及機器廠等爲較賡、此外零星亦時有買賣、惟最近以來、因本埠存底日竭、且海外又無現貨運滬、故執貨者心思頗覺挺秀、開價異常昂貴、昨市如二十四號花色每箱售一千二百元、二十六號貨則每箱喊六百元內、均係五十張裝、零星則每張需二十五元（二十四號）及十三元左右（二十六號）云、</p>
<p>小馬口鐵　昨市交內並未如何熱鬧、約二三十箱光景、大多係小五金帮及零碎門市售出、大批成交殊乏問津、故市氣欠振、人心亦萎、惟標準行情却因來源斷缺、及市存不豐、故每箱仍喊一百三十元耳、</p>
<h3>藥材　統木香產價鬆</h3>
<p>統木香近以產價迭有鬆動、划申比前廉宜不少、因此市勢驟落、步降百數十元之多、現市僅六百餘兀，尚未穩定、</p>

<h3>紙獵會伸述　農民阻撓真相　農民需索過奢改易路綫　因是引起誤會但不嚴重</h3>
<p>上海紙獵會昨函本報云申報館編輯先生合鑒、敬啟者、日前貴報刊載關於紙獵會消息、與事實頗有出入、鄙人忝爲紙獵會會長、爲剖白眞相起見敬將該事件之始末、叙述如下、乞卽賜刊貴報幅未、以當更正爲荷、按上星期日在紙獵賽終點　農民發生之爭端、據鄙　乃由於鄙人領導撒紙路綫、爲前所從未經過者、該區農民、對本會紙獵、苟事先有人向敝會警告、有所反對、則自當改易路綫以避之、乃經事後調查、始知爭端癥結、實山於下述原因、</p>
<p>初、鄙人原欲紙獵路綫、經過、淺沼、沼任終點迤北約三華里之村中、因該村居民、對於該處公路通過之代價、需索過奢乃改用該路略西之橋、於是該村村民、或因需索未遂而煽動人衆、故作搗亂、當日F午、該村村民中之若干人、來至敝　、表示遺憾、並由該村村長解釋謂彼等實欲得紙獵會之捐款、以修戢一附近之石橋耳、</p>
<p>農民對會向表好感</p>
<p>吾人舉行紙獵賽、全恃農民之同意與好感、農民欲對紙獵加以阻止、其道甚多、初不必出於投磚擲石、使竿用棒也、敝會歷來之政策、審慎從事、對於農民確對紙獵深閉固拒者、則該區域卽避不相犯、實言之、農民對於敝會確表歡迎、惟須過路納費而已、卽如吾人爲跳躍所用之小浜、亦係鄉民所代築者、不一而足、其大半固由敝會小工自造、然苛無地主之許可、小工亦何能從事耶、</p>
<p>所給代價無人中飽</p>
<p>某訪員稱敝會所付與農民之賠償金、類多爲人中飽、而眞止之地主、反無所得、卽在得之者、亦將於事後被土劣所攫去云云、然鄙人嘗於去冬及今春偕僕行鄉村間、足有二十里、親自散發賠償金於鄉人地主、此中並無間接手續、自可信款項之確入於地主之手也、其他童事在他區散發、一如我之所爲、不特此也、敝會之華董與中華會員於此工作、亦頗多贊囊之、</p>
<p>冒名頂替實不可能</p>
<p>凡鄉民之受款者、均有名錄、年加查點、以杜遺漏、當付款時鄉民之圍觀者甚衆、是故冒名頂替或謊稱地主而圖吞佔者、實不可能也、且此外村長亦多能表示合作、故鄉民朦混之事、當不致發生、是該區肇事之鄉民、對於吾人賠償辦法、殆未能了解耳、</p>
<p>損害園圃素懸厲禁</p>
<p>有會著　指吾人馳獵於密種菜蔬之園圃者、頗爲乖謬、蓋凡種植菜蔬之田畝、吾人必竭力避免之、至無法避免時、則停止前進、轉折而取道小徑、意外之踹踐、有時固在所難免、然損害甚微、而吾人父特別法意、必使得以賠償其所損而後已、專此、卽請編祺、上海紙獵會會長李淡爾J.H.Liddell敬啟、一九四零年十一月二十九日、</p>

<h3>我的媽媽是歌女</h3>
<p>— 華萍</p>
<p>在沒有說什麽以前，先讓我來介紹自己。</p>
<p>我是一個渡過了十四年沒有爸的生活的人，四歲上爸就棄了我們娘兒二個，沒有遺給媽一點財產，只留給媽他所喜愛的女兒。</p>
<p>媽是一個挺有志氣，挺能幹的女人，她不願見看叔伯們的白眼，她不願向戚屬中乞助，終於携了我到了上海開始她的奮鬥。她處處在和環境掙扎，在掙扎中求生存。</p>
<p>試想一個無助的弱女子，帶著四歲的孩子，在舉目無親的異地，怎能生活下去呢？可是我已生活了十四年，而且已能得到高中的敎育。我告訴你們，我流着淚告訴你們，現在我是一個歌女的女兒，巳做了十四年的歌女的女兒。</p>
<p>但我不以爲這是恥辱，我不以爲這是一件慚愧的事。爲着生存，爲着保存爸留給媽的唯一的遺物的緣故，媽這樣的做了。深夜裹媽常流着淚對我說着她的痛苦！她說她對不起爸！她說她對不起我，使我蒙着不潔的家辱。我們總是相對的哭着，到我熟睡了以後。次晨，我會發現枕旁的淚跡有時却在陲夢中哭醒。</p>
<p>現在我巳長大了，媽＋四年的苦心，得到了報酬。媽的犧牲，有了代價。我像我的媽，面貌身村生得相當的端整。每當客人在媽面前稱譽我時，或者在人叢四人們投來一瞥羨慕的眼光時，媽發出一個滿足的微笑。</p>
<p>今年我已十八歲了，在各方面我己形成了一個成熟的少女，可是却少了一顆少女的心。我沒有靑春，我沒有朋友，我沒有戀人。我怎能領我的朋友們到我的「家」裏來呢？我怎能告訴她們我是一個歌女的女兒呢？雖然知道這不是恥辱，這不是不可告人的醜事，但是無情的社會，又怎能諒解呢？每當女同學們妒忌地瞧着我，男同學們貪婪地望着我時，我的心跳個不停，好像他們巳發現了我的秘密。追求的信件，常常在我的課桌內發現，我總是無情地把它撕了我雖稱不上艷若桃李」，但我却眞「冷若冰霜一，雖然內心蘊藏著少女同有的青春的熱情</p>
<p>天呀，我已被目爲一個變態的神經病者。誰知道我的心是比仟何人更淸醒呢？我想坦白地揭發我自己，但我怎能忍受社會的物議呢？我愛朋友，我喜歡集團，但我却遇着最孤寂的生活！</p>
<p>我已十八歲了，我不是一個畸人，可是我沒有享受過「人」應享的權利。</p>
<h3>「何其巧也！」</h3>
<p>— 朕</p>
<p>我自信求知欲頗不弱，閑來無事，開卷有益。却還有種種看不透，識不準的事情。譬如說，世界大勢何以悽慘混亂，一至於此極？我眞是沒有方法找到一個簡單明瞭的滿意答案。有一次，一位老朋友，扶杖到寒舍，談天說地之餘，他忽然正襟危坐，長歎一聲，說：人類驕奢淫逸，應遭浩刦，故天降羣魔，搗亂眾生。他又舉了幾位大名鼎鼎的世界好漢，指爲星宿；他斷言大亂大殺是天數。當然，這不是我所期待的答索。</p>
<p>前天却不由得我驚奇叫絕。信手翻開一本繼出版的雜誌裏面載着一方花邊文字，篇名「何其巧也！」係M.L.Mayfux先生原著。方小孟先生譯的，我看了渾身毛髮幾乎全豎了起來，覺得不是天，不是數，決不如此巧！現在先鈔在下面：</p>
<p>太巧了！我以爲倘使祇以巧字了之，未免太弱，亦未免太不負責任。倘使「推原其故」，則眞是不懂，難道這四位大權大貴，眞是天造地設，天賦天命？我第一念，以爲行之中國，大約天干地支，自有所本，五行生尅，自成格局，星命之學必有道理。第二念，想到蔣委員長豐功偉烈，難道不如他們。於是查考蔣委員長的出處，不料又爲之驚奇叫絕，原來，蔣委員長的：</p>
<p>眞是使我呆住了！還有何話可說，還有何理可講，祇是歸之天命罷了！却又來r第三念。我四十年來，服務報界，亦得自尊爲無冕帝王；也許無冕帝王的天賦格局，不亞於前舉諸位名公，於是，竊自推排，那知不排猶可，一排之後，大笑一聲，幾乎咯血身亡。原來我的：</p>
<p>讀者諸君啊！實非區區故意高攀，所排是實！比附名公，完全相同，那裏冉容區區妄自菲薄，攬鏡自照，眞是得意，反躬自省，却是慚愧，左思右想，不覺野心勃勃，前瞻後顧，不免渺渺茫茫；失眠數夜以迄今天。我的小兒子從學校裏歸來，他居然看出我心神不定，我也就欣欣然的誇示他。不料他眉頭一縐的說，這是M.L.Mayfux的故肆狡獪，引人入勝。誕生年加了年齡，當然等於同年年份。上臺年份加r迄今執政年份，亦當然等於今年年份，兩個今年除二，常然還是今年。用此推排，誰都一樣。</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第十二章　報告和解釋</p>
<p>他說道：「這老頭兒不但吃苦，大槪要送命了。不過這也是他應得的酬報。一他把手中拿着的兩張紙重新展開來。一金壽兄，松泉的報告完全沒有錯誤。那兩個傢伙眞是　而無功。李芝範把　鐲鑽　和牛乳珠耳環換來的鈔票，已用快信寄給他兒子了。這裏有一張快信收據，和一張匯票收據，數目是四千五百六十元。」他隨手把兩張展開的紙授給倪金壽瞧。</p>
<p>我　得這兩張紙，霍桑在靑蒲路跟大同路的轉角上，從李芝範的衣袋裏搜出來的。他當時曾告訴我兩張收據，我却想不到是這樣一回事。倪余壽向松泉揮揮手，叫他出去，回頭來向霍桑說話。</p>
<p>他值：「霍先生，你現在可以把李芝範的動機告訴我了嗎？」</p>
<p>霍桑答道：「他的動機很淺顯，金錢是唯一的主題，還有一部份聯帶作用，我不妨也暫作一個假定。如果說錯，好在還可以讓李守琦來糾正。</p>
<p>「我已跟包朗兒說過，李芝範是個修養不足的人。他過慣了樸素的農村生活，一朝踏進了五色眩目的都市社會，他的心便把握不定。他眼見王麗蘭這樣子奢侈浪費，他的心便不禁躍躍欲動。他本是麗蘭的姑夫，同時伊又是他的未婚媳婦。最好自然是麗蘭肯跟他們回去，可是事實上麗蘭也巳被環境澈底變換他們的願望當然是不能實現了。</p>
<p>「這一次守琦到上海來，分明就爲着要解決他們的婚約。我猜想守琦的意思，還不肯放棄麗蘭，希望完成這不可能的婚姻。麗蘭當然不會答應，或許曾允許給他多少錢，解除這件婚約。那父子倆的心事怎樣，我當然不能猜得完全正確，但我料想麗蘭的建議，李芝範也許是贊成的，但李守琦却是痴心妄想，企圖人財兩得。但瞧前天十七夜裹，李守琦的無恥企圖，終於由他的老子排解開來，可見芝範對於麗蘭的感情，還不曾破裂。所以在咋天十八日早晨，守琦雖不歡而散地回蘇州去，芝範却仍能留在這裹。（一八一）</p>

<h3>紀名小生兪振飛將參加堂會演「獅吼記」</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>崑曲一道，曲高和寡，除仙霓社諸子外，幾成絕響，俞振飛君吳中世家，其尊人粟廬公，精於曲韻，啊「曲王」之稱，俞君幼秉家傳，搖籃時期卽熟聞「三醉一中「紅綉鞋」一段，無異通俗之催眠歌也。七歲從沈月泉老前輩習身段，十五歲第一次登台於蘇州陸順祥狀元第，唱的是望鄉」，後父在上海亞令配克戲院爲崑曲傳習所籌慕經費客串數次，自後不時漏臉於紅氍毺上。迨栗廬公駕歸道山，時程硯秋方準備赴法國表演，缺乏小生人村，力挽俞成行，俞以由程介紹　程繼先爲師爲條件，竟蒙破格錄取，遂云北平：適出國之議作罷，乃留習藝，以年民而立，練功能吊腿，骨格已硬，覺難有成就，二年後改學文戲，硏究臉部表情，進步甚速，後又返滬，任曁南大學戲曲音韻敎授三年，是時程硯秋又相約出國，故再度赴平，一切皆籌備就緖，而蘆溝橋戰事發生，赴法之行乃又成絕影。云年，與新豔秋來滬，在更新合作演出，今秋復膺黃金之聘，巳於二十一日合同期滿，本擬卽返北平搭班，適倪高風君太夫人六旬仙慶，其友好假牯嶺　凈土庵舉行公祝，王傳淞君舞邀仙霓杜全體同人參加表演，俞君與朱傅茗鄭傳鑑三人將合演壓軸戲「獅吼記」，屆時顧曲周郎，必能飽耳目之福也。</p>
<h3>女藝人羣像</h3>
<p>— 唐</p>
<p>（八）周鍊霞</p>
<p>如果爲女藝人作傳記，那我們是不應該漏列了周鍊霞小姐的，周小姐是有名的女畫家，女詩人，又寫得一手的簪花妙格，她的畫，照例是自繪自題，畫詩書三絕，在周小姐眞是可以當之無愧的。不但如此，周小姐更富於辯才，稠人廣座之間，往往言論風發，顯示了她的倜儻不羣的藝人丰度。有一次，我曾在某盡師府上，與周小姐討論到詩的工力與性靈的問題，周小姐對於此一問題發揮了許多可貴的意見；在藝事方面，她的成就眞是值得人欽佩的。</p>
<p>鍊霞小姐　字紫宜，原籍江西吉安，她的尊入鶴年先生，淸季曾任長沙太守，所以鍊霞小姐的誕生地却是長沙；鶴年先生生前，對於金石書賽都甚有心得，鍊霞小姐幼承家學，自小就十分穎慧，在十二歲的時候已開始爲人書扇，偶作小詩，亦復斐然可觀；自移家來滬以後，先後從湖州老書師鄭壺叟習畫，從宜興國學家蔣梅笙攻國學，這樣終於使她優秀的天才獲得了鍛鍊的機會，從而臻於成功之域，她的晝，山水人物與花烏蟲魚，無不兼擅，最近中國女子害畫會舉行第七屆展覽會，她以「金闕早朝」「廣寒仙奏」眉壽圖」以及花卉屏數幅，參加展覽，畫筆沒有一幅不是工細絕倫，尤其是設色的妍麗，使畫面顯得格外的嫵媚，燦爛；其中「眉壽圖一幅，獲得了虞洽老的讚賞，以一百十元的代價定購了去。此外更有仕女扇面數葉，殿以小楷，作扇骨之形，新奇而叉悅目，因此也定購一空。這一次畫展，爲期五天，結果以鍊霞小姐的定件成績爲第一，占全會七份之一强，足見她的藝事之爲人所重視。</p>
<p>鍊霞小姐生平，除了浸淫於藝事之外，唯一的嗜好是收集攝影，她的閨中藏有十餘册黏貼着各式各樣攝影的册子，其中很有許多名貴的照片，鍊霞小姐是將它當作一種藝術財產的。此外，她也愛跳舞，愛看電影，但是在居家之時，對於烹飪縫級之術，却又無所不擅，她眞是一個多材多藝的新女性。</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Meets with Morse Yesterday: China and the United States to Establish New Loans, China Continues to Order Large Amounts of Military Supplies in the United States, Totaling Over US$11 Million</h3>
<p>Washington – According to news from here last night, Mr. Song Ziwen will meet with Mr. Bills, the director of the Export-Import Bank, and Mr. Jones, the chairman of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, today. Therefore, all parties believe that the United States is about to grant another loan to China. American officials pointed out that the exact decision on the new loan will be made after some time. A Chinese source said that the current talks in Washington involve the possibility of the United States seeking to purchase a large quantity of goods from China within one or two years. This news is largely consistent with the statement issued by Mr. Jones. Some sources say that a new loan to China may be established tomorrow. It is generally believed that if the new loan to China is delayed, the United States may take other measures, possibly involving further embargoes against Japan, as an expression of opposition to Japan’s recognition of the "Nanjing Government." (United Press Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Washington – The U.S. Department of State announced yesterday that the delivery of military aircraft to the United Kingdom and Canada increased significantly in mid-October, and China has also continued to purchase large quantities of military supplies recently. The total value of American aircraft received by the United Kingdom in October was US$10,177,776, while the total value of American aircraft received by the United Kingdom in the first nine months of this year was US$50,424,018. The value of American aircraft received by Canada in October was US$1,929,333. The total value of American military supplies imported into the United Kingdom in mid-October was US$20,892,000. China has obtained export licenses for American military supplies worth US$957,000 in mid-October. Most of these military supplies are explosives and powerful bombs. In the ten months of this year, the total value of military equipment allowed for export in the military equipment export licenses obtained by China is US$11,597,000, most of which are aircraft and aircraft parts. In mid-October, the U.S. government did not issue any licenses allowing military supplies to be transported to Japan. The State Department also stated that in mid-October, it also issued licenses to allow the shipment of military supplies to the Dutch East Indies. The total value of the military supplies allowed to be shipped is US$1,116,000, of which armored vehicles account for US$8,649,000. The State Department also pointed out that the issuance of licenses only means that the goods can be shipped, and does not mean that the goods have actually been shipped. The licenses obtained by Thailand in this month are for the shipment of aircraft engines worth US$344,887, but the country did not obtain a single license in October. Australia obtained export licenses for aircraft engines worth US$1,314,250 in mid-October, and it has obtained export licenses for military equipment worth US$5,238,000 in the ten months of this year. (United Press Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Washington – It is rumored here today that Song Ziwen is doing his utmost to urge Roosevelt to complete a new loan of US$200 million to China. It is reported that the Chongqing government intends to use part of the loan to purchase 500 aircraft, and the U.S. government has agreed to send the aircraft to China. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Chairman of the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee George Will Visit England; After the New Congress Opens in January Next Year, He Will Take Concrete Action to Assist Britain</h3>
<p>Washington – The remarks made by British Ambassador to the United States Lothian regarding Britain’s needs seem to have been very successful if he can promptly raise the issue of increasing aid to Britain to the American public. Congressional newspapers and private individuals are all using this as a basis for debate. It is generally believed that Britain is fighting not only for itself but also for the United States, so the United States will definitely provide assistance when necessary. The influential Washington Post stated that Britain has not yet reached the point of being completely bankrupt, but the British have to statistically calculate their resources based on the theory that the war of attrition will be protracted. For the sake of careful military planning, all their credit and assets are mobilized. If Britain can foresee that what it purchases in the United States can be obtained on credit from the United States, then its war plan can certainly be more thorough and have greater confidence. What is the answer of the United States to this? There is no doubt that when considering the appropriate time for the loan, the United States will definitely fully agree to it. The statement made by Senator George, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, that he personally supports aid to Britain and will discuss it with the head of the administration can be regarded as implying that concrete action will be taken after the new Congress opens in January next year. Unconfirmed news: George will fly to England to visit British Prime Minister Churchill and other important figures. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Washington – Official sources revealed that the U.S. government has allowed Britain to deliver an average of 600 warplanes to Britain per month over the next two years. The United States is now giving Britain priority in the construction of fighter jets. By next year, the United States will have a large number of trainer aircraft for its own use. Therefore, by July 1942, the U.S. Army will have 7,500 fighter jets and 6,500 trainer aircraft, and the U.S. Navy will have 5,000 fighter jets and 2,000 trainer aircraft.

<h3>Mysterious Explosion at U.S. Ammunition Factory; Cause Not Yet Determined</h3>
<p>Washington – A mysterious explosion suddenly occurred at DuPont’s ammunition factory yesterday, destroying a house, but fortunately no one was injured. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>London – According to American telegrams, explosions have occurred frequently in New Jersey factories recently, and the cause is unknown, leading to suspicions that villains are secretly causing trouble. Yesterday, mysterious explosions were again heard in Tacoma and Toppenish, Washington. A warehouse in Toppenish was destroyed, and many people in the basement could not escape. It is reported that the explosion was caused by the explosion of explosives or a gas leak. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Hubei Army Gains Victory; Li Jiadang and Xianju are Recaptured One After Another; Japanese Attempt to Break Through East of Dahong Mountain Fails</h3>
<p>Yicheng – About 5,000 Japanese troops, who invaded the northwest of Jingmen from the east bank of the Xiang River, ventured into Xianju, Li Jiadang and other places. The Chinese army used the dangerous mountainous roads to seize the opportunity to surround the Japanese army. Starting from dawn on the 27th, they launched a fierce attack on them. By night, they had recaptured Li Jiadang. On the 28th, they continued to recapture Xianju. It is estimated that more than 3,000 Japanese troops were killed. The remaining Japanese troops broke through and fled in defeat. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory to pursue fiercely, and completely cleared out the remaining Japanese troops from south of Kuaihuo Shop to the Hujiaji area, seizing countless spoils of war, which are being counted. The Japanese troops who attacked the area north of Huangjiaji from Dangyang were severely defeated by the Chinese army, and the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. (Telegram on the 29th)</p>
<p>Xiangyang – The Japanese troops who attacked three li east of Dahong Mountain were surrounded by the Chinese army. By the 29th, the Japanese army had broken through several times, but all failed. The Chinese army is now tightening the encirclement and fiercely annihilating the Japanese army. (Telegram on the 29th)</p>
<p>Fancheng – In the Wanshan campaign on the Xianghua Road in northern Hubei, the Chinese army dealt a heavy blow to the Japanese army. It is estimated that more than 400 Japanese corpses were left at Lishan and more than 700 Japanese corpses were left at Liangshuigou. (Telegram on the 29th)</p>
<h3>The Whole Line of Japanese Troops in Central and Northern Hubei Retreats After Being Defeated</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The winter offensive launched by the Japanese troops in northern and central Hubei has entered a stage of victory for the Chinese army by the morning of the 29th, and the Japanese army has been frustrated. If they do not retreat quickly, they will again fall into a major defeat. Regarding the harassment of the Japanese army and the annihilation by the Chinese army, a military expert recently told a Central News Agency reporter in detail as follows: The Japanese troops trapped on both sides of the Xiang River began to move on the 24th of this month. In northern Hubei, some Japanese troops gathered a large number of troops from Maping and Danhe in Suixian and attacked the Wanshan area in separate groups. After the Chinese army calmly responded and counterattacked separately, the entire Japanese line was defeated to the south and retreated to the Jinjishan-Kuaihuo Ridge area. On the 27th, the Japanese army reinforced from Suixian again, attempting to attack. The Chinese army dispatched troops on the 28th to drive one of their groups to Tangjiachong and another group to Duanjiawan to carry out individual annihilation, killing a large number of them. There are no Japanese troops in the Jinjishan area now. Another group of Japanese troops on the east bank of the Xiang River attacked the Changshoudian area near the west foothills of Dahong Mountain from Zhongxiang, and suffered heavy casualties after repeated fierce attacks by the Chinese army. On the 27th, the Japanese army launched a counterattack again in two routes. The elite troops of the Chinese army in the Bianzhai-Sanhe area began to counterattack the Japanese army on the morning of the 28th. The Japanese army was caught off guard and suffered heavy losses, and fled in defeat. The Chinese army is continuing to pursue them. As for the west bank of the Xiang River, the Japanese army advanced northward from the Dangyang-Jingmen-Zhaxihe line on the 24th. The Chinese army had made thorough arrangements early, so it lured the Japanese army to penetrate deeply. The Japanese army indeed advanced fiercely in one group to the area north of Huangjiaji, harassed Miaobian in one group, and attempted to attack Yangjiazhai in one group. The Chinese army saw that the Japanese forces were dispersed, and each group had entered the Chinese encirclement, so it began a full-scale fierce attack. The Japanese army's retreat routes were all cut off by the Chinese army. By the morning of the 29th, the entire Japanese army had collapsed and fled south. The Japanese army suffered heavy losses in the campaign, and the Chinese army achieved great results. At the beginning of the Japanese army's move, they claimed that the Chinese army was preparing to attack, and the Japanese army only controlled the Chinese army's opportunity first and made advance cover-up. The failure this time means that the Japanese have become exhausted. No matter how much they bluff and bluster, they are outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and the result is no more than the previous Jiacheng campaign and the Zhusheng campaign, watching them fall into the trap. (Telegram on the 29th)</p>
<p>Fancheng – More than 2,000 Japanese troops in northern Zhongxiang attacked in two routes on the 27th. The Chinese army carried out a flanking attack on the Japanese army in the Biansai-Wangjiahe area, and the Japanese army retreated in defeat. (Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>Fancheng – Part of the Japanese troops at the east foothills of Dahong Mountain attacked Sanliyan on the 27th. The Chinese army carried out a flanking and pincer attack, driving the Japanese army into the mountain pass. The battle is still ongoing. (Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>Fancheng – The Chinese army on the west bank of the Xiang River annihilated all the Japanese troops in the Heyuan area. About 3,000 infantry and eight artillery pieces of the Japanese army that attacked north from Jingmen fought fiercely with the Chinese army for two days. On the 27th, they were defeated by the Chinese army, and the Japanese offensive was frustrated. (Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>Fancheng – The Japanese troops who retreated from northern Sui attempted to continue fighting with the Chinese army with hundreds of reinforcements on the 27th. The Chinese army's pursuit troops drove one group to Tangjiachong and another group to Duanjiawan, carrying out separate attacks and killing many of them. (Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<p>Fancheng – The Songhe-Yingcheng highway was destroyed by a certain unit of the Chinese army on the 27th. This line is the supply line for the Japanese army in Tongxian, Huajing, and Zhong areas. Therefore, the supplies to the front lines of the Japanese army in these two areas have been cut off. (Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army is Ready to Launch a Major Counteroffensive at Any Time</h3>
<p>Chongqing – According to well-informed sources here, it is rumored that a million elite troops of the Chinese army, fully equipped, have gathered on the northern and southern fronts to await the commander-in-chief's order for a general counteroffensive. This statement seems to be too early. The Chinese army is ready to launch a large-scale counteroffensive at any time, which is taken for granted. However, this move must wait for a large number of aircraft from overseas, either from the United States or from Britain, to arrive. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Northeastern Sanshui Retreat in Defeat</h3>
<p>Guilin: The Japanese troops entrenched in Xiacunnan, Wei (northeast of Sanshui) built an artillery position in Bihu Gang, bombarding the Huaxian Jueyuan. At the same time, a part of the Japanese troops in Nanbianwu advanced from Xiacun to the Huaxian Jueyuan Yegang. After a fierce battle of three hours, the Japanese troops retreated in defeat to the Xiacun Datoutou line, and then retreated in defeat to Yangmei. (Telegram on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Army Achieves Important Results</h3>
<p>Xiushui: The results of the battle in which the Chinese army captured Muwangzhuang, southwest of Ruichang, have been cleared. It is estimated that 548 Japanese soldiers were killed, 52 were captured, and 23 have died due to serious injuries.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How Should the Business Community Deal With Change?</h3>
<p>In a turbulent world, worries and dangers lie ahead, interests move within, reason loses its constancy, and there is no time to examine good and evil, right and wrong. But the good will never lose its goodness, and the right will never lose its rightness. In the past, there were those who doubted the future of the legal tender, but now the legal tender is still the most common and most trusted currency, which is universally recognized; further thinking about the future, no matter how difficult the situation of the legal tender is, it will always be indestructible. Even if there are those who slander it and destroy it, it will not harm its essence. Therefore, those with capital have no reason to be afraid and no reason to hesitate. If they lightly engage in speculation due to suspicion, they will only see themselves destroyed. Originally, speculators are gamblers, with profits and losses, and successes and failures are uncertain. If you think you can rely on this, then the fundamental nature of speculation is an iceberg: If you know that it is unreliable, then why use your wealth as a desperate gamble! Leaving aside speculation, the temporary gains and losses are not enough to be gains and losses. Only a long-term vision has its value. The gains and losses of one corner are not enough to be gains and losses. Only the final success is the real victory. Therefore, those who are now hovering in the buying and selling market, constantly worrying about the stakes, should take a step back and think about it. Do not think that the market will inevitably rise and fall endlessly, and always give speculators the opportunity to maneuver; you must know that the world is changing constantly, and you will see sudden and turbulent waves; this reaction, even a rapid decline, is unpredictable.</p>
<p>To put it bluntly, a country standing in the world cannot close itself off economically and be independent of the country: Today and in the future, China's economy is dependent on the War of Resistance; the day of victory in the War of Resistance is the time of economic prosperity. The causes and consequences of war for the national economy are deeply related and have complex effects, which cannot be detailed here; but considering the interconnectedness of international relations, the close relationship between prosperity and decline, which friendly countries that are closely related to China's national economy are willing to see China's three-year efforts in the War of Resistance wasted in one day? From the past to the future, those who provide assistance to China are actually benefiting themselves and China, and all are based on the principle of mutual benefit and driven by the calculation of mutual benefit. This is not only the case for China, but the United States' aid to Britain is for the sake of justice and also for its own sake. Otherwise, the barriers of the Atlantic Ocean would be completely dismantled. The United States has decided to aid China, and aid to China has not started today, but only because there are obstacles, the aid is not seen to be active. But what will happen in the future? Jones' words are worth pondering. Whether it is fifty million or one hundred million, as long as China has a way, the United States will not be stingy. Therefore, during the period of China's continued War of Resistance, no matter how long the period is, even if China's economic situation reaches an extreme degree of difficulty, it is expected, but it will never fall into a desperate situation with no way out, this can be said with certainty. Victory originally requires hard work to achieve; what is being fought for. This is hard work that does not end, and the other is that international blockade is increasingly tightened and collapses first. This is the difference between having help and not having help. It is also the judgment of victory and defeat. The sky is about to dawn, and the darkness is very thick; the rainstorm is about to pass, and the drops are getting bigger;</p>
<p>Shanghai's future situation may be similar to drinking. However, why should the business community be spared from losses? Do not fall into the trap yourself. If the war expands, the expenses will be more complicated, the extortion will be more severe, and they will intensify the squeeze in various ways and on various pretexts; in addition, there are many who take advantage of the fire and loot and take the opportunity to profit; therefore, legitimate industry and commerce will inevitably suffer greatly, even to the point of being unable to stand, and eventually be swallowed up. Moreover, there is no need to wait for the future, even in terms of the present, those who do business in the concession, although they have not been restricted on the surface, are generally the same as the industrial and commercial circles in the occupied areas in terms of the entry and exit of goods, such as the wheat of flour mills, the cotton of yarn mills, the rice of rice shops (except for foreign rice at present), and even vegetables, fish and meat, which seem to have an endless source. In reality, they are all leftovers after being squeezed dry. As for the so-called exorbitant taxes and levies, these are all inherent Chinese terms, but when examining the degree of cruelty, it is unprecedented in Chinese history. It is now very severe, and who knows whether it will become worse in the future due to exhaustion, causing the concession to suffer even more cruelty! In the coming disaster, the people of the city should understand in advance. Do not regard it as an unexpected blow, and be prepared to endure all kinds of devastation and all kinds of suffering; treat it calmly until the arrival of light. Those who act perversely will inevitably fall soon, this is the law of nature, and the ultimate truth.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, what is first coveted is currency, but based on the experience of the "Federal Reserve Notes," Japan may not want to seek trouble for itself and take the same action, but it must also think about establishing a relationship with it. The currency system problem is extremely difficult, and it cannot be commanded by empty talk, nor can it be controlled by high pressure. Therefore, planning on paper will inevitably be difficult to achieve. It is not an overnight thing to destroy the deeply rooted legal tender. If you want to borrow time, then time is the most un monopolizable thing and is shared by everyone. This is an economic war, not a positional war. We use strategy to maneuver and strength to determine the outcome. Chinese and foreign people must deeply believe in the depth of the legal tender. Is there any need to wait for the outcome to be determined in the future? In terms of foreign exchange, foreign exchange is actually controlled by the United Kingdom and the United States, which is undeniable. The reason why Shanghai has today's foreign exchange market is that British and American merchants at that time were too attached to short-term gains and harbored thoughts of appeasement, and did not make a thorough solution. In the future, British and American merchants should also have the courage to burn their boats and fight to the end not only in the war but also in finance. Then, the future of foreign exchange will inevitably be more favorable to a free China.</p>
<p>In short, the business community must try to suppress temporary impulses, reject bizarre rumors, maintain calmness, and not seek trouble for themselves. Do not look at the fact that after Tianjin banned the use of the legal tender, the value of the legal tender rose instead, because the currency used has no reserves, so it has little value in international exchange. When going in and out, the legal tender is still required. It can be seen that the depth of the legal tender is by no means empty talk, and the British pound and American gold dollar will definitely give the legal tender the necessary support in policy.</p>

<h3>Actively Developing Gansu Gasoline</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Besides the Governor of Gansu Province, Mr. Xi Duan, there are many Chinese engineers, leading thousands of workers, producing mineral oil needed for China's wartime efforts. The oil deposits in Gansu have been known for a long time. After months of tireless work and research by many engineers, experts estimate that if enough oil wells are drilled, annual production could reach 80 million gallons, enough to last for a hundred years. Currently, three oil wells are producing oil, and the fourth is being drilled. The quality of Gansu gasoline is said to be better than Russian gasoline. Trucks using Russian oil can only travel six kilometers per gallon, while trucks using Gansu gasoline can travel nine kilometers per gallon. (Haitong dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Production Survey of China's Free Areas</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Minister of Economic Affairs Weng Wenhao recently announced that the value of mineral production in China's free areas is expected to reach 1,050,600,000 yuan this year, but the actual amount extracted so far is only worth 740,000,000 yuan, indicating that there is untapped potential. In addition, the total value of production by various private industries this year is 255,600,000 yuan, while the value of production by state-owned industries is 55,000,000 yuan. There are currently 448 private enterprises in the free areas, not including small-scale handicraft industries. The number of state-owned factories is not available. Also, 120,000 tons of various machinery and 12,000 skilled workers have been successively moved to western China this year. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to estimates by the National Agricultural Research Institute, the total rice production in the fifteen provinces of China's free areas this year is 71,510,000 dan, a decrease of 13% compared to last year. However, this situation is not severe. If the authorities can force merchants, landlords, bankers, and other hoarders to sell their stored rice, the market supply and demand can be adjusted immediately. Moreover, last year's bumper harvest left a surplus of 50 million dan to make up for this year's shortfall. In addition, cotton production this year totaled 7 million dan, an increase of 20% compared to last year. Sweet potato production also increased to 14 million dan. Overall, agricultural harvests last year were between 65% and 70% of normal, with Sichuan Province at 58%, the lowest among the provinces. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Supplementary Measures for Encouraging Industrial Technology</h3>
<p>Chongqing - The Provisional Regulations for Encouraging Industrial Technology and their Implementation Rules, promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, stipulate certain procedures for applying for patents, granting rights, and revoking rights for those who invent or create industrial technologies. However, they lack a proactive spirit of assistance. At this important stage of resistance and reconstruction, industrial inventions and creations are of great importance. The Ministry has therefore formulated seven supplementary measures, especially for industrial inventions or research that have a real hope of success but lack the resources to complete them, or those who have already obtained patent rights but whose articles or methods are related to national defense and people's livelihoods but lack the resources to set up factories to manufacture them, or whose articles or methods have made special contributions to national defense and people's livelihoods, all of which will be strongly protected and assisted to promote them.

If, after review, it is qualified, the Ministry of Economic Affairs may designate its affiliated research and experimental institutions and factories to provide facilities for experimentation with the existing machinery and equipment. Article 3. If the applicant who has passed the review in the preceding article has financial difficulties during the experimentation period, and this is verified to be true, the Ministry of Economic Affairs may provide living expenses according to the following standards: (1) Those who are inventors shall be given an amount commensurate with the salary of a second-class technical assistant. (2) Those who are creators shall be given an amount commensurate with the salary of a third-class technical assistant. Article 4. The experimentation period in the preceding article shall not exceed the following limits from the date of commencement of the experimentation: (1) One year for inventors. (2) Half a year for creators. The above time limit shall not be extended without special reasons submitted to and approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Article 5. An invention or creation approved for patent under the Provisional Regulations for Encouraging Industrial Technology that has special value for national defense and people's livelihoods and meets any of the following conditions, the Ministry of Economic Affairs may grant rewards or commendations in accordance with the Regulations for Encouraging Industry: (1) There are no similar articles manufactured and sold domestically or similar methods applied in industry at home and abroad. (2) It can resist imported goods and reduce large amounts of international imports. (3) It can be promoted abroad and increase large amounts of exports. (4) It can remedy the shortage of domestic materials and make significant contributions. Article 6. Inventions or creations related to national defense and people's livelihoods that have been approved for patent rights and are manufactured in factories in the interior, in addition to being granted rewards and assistance in accordance with the Industrial Encouragement Law and the Provisional Regulations for Encouraging and Assisting Industry and Mining during Extraordinary Periods, the Ministry of Economic Affairs may grant low-interest credit loans in accordance with the Provisional Measures for Small Industrial Loans. Article 7. These measures shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. (Dispatch, 29th)</p>

(Haitong dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Struga, on the north shore of Lake Ohrid, Southern Yugoslavia - Reports received here indicate that Greek forces have achieved a victory, storming into Argyrokastron. The city has become a blood-soaked ruin. In yesterday's major battle, Greek forces suffered 7 officers and 150 soldiers killed, and 300 wounded. Italian forces suffered 11 officers and 300 soldiers killed, and approximately 500 wounded. The city fell at 4:00 PM. The Greeks first launched a heavy artillery barrage on the city and then bombed it heavily with aircraft. Then, the two armies engaged in a fierce bayonet and hand-to-hand combat, each using bayonets, trench knives, and hand grenades. Five British Blenheim bombers and three Greek aircraft engaged ten Italian bombers in the sky. Three Italian aircraft were shot down, and one British aircraft was forced to land. The Greek artillery bombardment began at noon. A large part of the city was destroyed, and the dead buried in the rubble are estimated to be around three or four hundred.

<h3>Italian Commander-in-Chief Directing at the Front; Rome Telegraph Denies This</h3>
<p>London - Athens radio reported that General Badoglio, commander-in-chief of the Italian army, has arrived in Tirana, the capital of Albania, to direct military operations against the Greeks. One of his first actions was to order the execution by firing squad of one-seventh of the Italian troops who retreated from the front lines due to poor performance. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Berlin - The German news agency quoted a Rome telegram as saying that General Badoglio, Chief of the General Staff of the Italian Army, is still in Rome. Military officials have denied reports that Badoglio has gone to the Albanian capital, and that Greek forces have occupied Argyrokastron.</p>

<h3>Order Restored in Korçë; Albanian and Greek Flags Fly Everywhere</h3>
<p>Korçë - Residents here are recounting incidents of several Italian officers abandoning their soldiers and fleeing. Order has now been restored, and a large portion of the residents are Greek. Albanian and Greek flags are flown at all military posts and public institutions to indicate that the Greek forces came here to liberate Albanians, not to conquer them. The Greek military has strict discipline. Although food is scarce and they have endured weeks of long marches, they never forcibly requisition food from civilians. Therefore, the residents are very pleased with the Greek occupation, as the Greek military's actions are very different from Italian colonial methods. Signs of the Italian efforts to assimilate Korçë are gradually disappearing, and the region is taking on a more rational appearance. The Italian army fled the city in haste, without damaging it, so the city was undamaged. However, the countryside outside the city was not so fortunate. According to Albanians in charge, the villagers were greatly abused. The Italian military's discipline relied solely on Fascist Party leaders, gendarmes, and a small number of Blackshirts. Morale was extremely low. When the two sides fought on the Morava Mountains, the Italian army collapsed and scattered like a flock of birds. Only the Blackshirts defended the plateau against the Greek army. These people were eventually annihilated. Although Italian Commander-in-Chief General Badoglio ordered that Korçë be held, the Italian soldiers who retreated from the front only made the city more chaotic. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Defeat of the Italian Army in Southern Albania: Corpses of Italian Soldiers Scattered Throughout the Valleys</h3>
<p>Korçë – The plain of Korçë will henceforth occupy a prominent page in Italian history. The retreat of the Italian army can only be compared to the Battle of Caporetto in the last World War. The Italian army's retreat from Guadalajara during the Spanish Civil War was far smaller in scale. Italian soldiers' corpses littered the heights of Morava. A column of cavalry moving through a valley was suddenly attacked by Greek cavalry charging down from the mountains, suffering heavy losses. Greek mountain artillery, positioned on the high ground, bombarded the Italian strongholds defending Korçë and destroyed the Italian barracks in the city.

<p>London – The Admiralty released a detailed account of the engagement between British and Italian warships in the Mediterranean on Wednesday. On Wednesday afternoon, British warships encountered two Italian battleships and several cruisers and destroyers 77 miles northeast of Italian-held Sardinia. The leading British warships sighted four enemy cruisers a few minutes after noon and immediately opened fire. The enemy cruisers returned fire and quickly turned away, creating a smokescreen and speeding northeastward. At 12:10 PM, two enemy battleships and one cruiser were sighted. The enemy battleships opened fire on the British cruisers, which were forced to retreat due to their superior firepower. However, the enemy battleships also retreated after a few minutes, and the British cruisers immediately continued the pursuit but were unable to catch up. The British battleship "Renown" made every effort to engage, but the enemy ships retreated quickly and were not brought to battle. At 1:10 PM, the pursuit reached a point a few miles from the enemy coast, and the British ships ceased their advance. By this time, the enemy ships had scattered and were at a great distance from the British ships, using smokescreens, so the extent of the damage they sustained could not be ascertained. However, according to reconnaissance reports from British aircraft, the enemy ships had suffered significant damage from British gunfire before reaching the coast to take refuge or escaping behind the smokescreen. One enemy cruiser, believed to be armed with 8-inch guns, had a severe fire burning on its stern. One enemy destroyer had its stern submerged and was listing heavily, while another enemy destroyer was slightly listing and proceeding very slowly. During the British pursuit, naval aircraft from the British aircraft carrier "Ark Royal" repeatedly launched fierce attacks. One Swordfish aircraft attacked an enemy battleship with a torpedo, hitting a powerful new Littorio-class battleship. Other Swordfish aircraft attacked three enemy 8-inch gun cruisers, and a torpedo likely hit the stern of a 10,000-ton Pola-class enemy ship. After this attack, the speed of the enemy flagship immediately decreased. A squadron of British Skua aircraft then attacked an enemy 6-inch gun cruiser, and its boilers appeared to have been damaged. All British aircraft returned safely. The British cruiser "Berwick" was also hit by two shells, but the damage was minor, and the ship remains combat-ready. The British suffered one officer and six sailors killed, two sailors severely wounded, and seven slightly wounded. The British ships were also attacked by ten bombers escorted by fighters, but naval aircraft intercepted them, so the British ships were not damaged. At 4:40 PM, fifteen enemy bombers, divided into three groups, attacked again. British fighters again intercepted them, and some enemy aircraft managed to penetrate and drop thirty bombs. The guns of the "Ark Royal" fired fiercely at the enemy aircraft, and the ship was not damaged, and there were no casualties among the crew. One enemy Cant Z.506B three-engine seaplane and one R.403 seaplane were shot down. The British also lost one fighter. Apart from this aircraft and the damage to the "Berwick" and the slight casualties, the British suffered no other losses or damage. Italian radio in Rome yesterday acknowledged that the Italian destroyer "Lanciere" was hit and severely damaged during the engagement and had to be towed into port by another ship. The Italian cruiser "Fiume" was also hit by a shell, but it did not explode. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>Rome – An Italian military communiqué stated that Italian aircraft spotted a British naval fleet near Malta and bombed it, scoring a direct hit on a large British warship.

The Italians lost one aircraft. The communiqué also stated that 300 Italian aircraft bombed Greek communication lines, shooting down four Greek aircraft and losing two Italian aircraft. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<p>London – The Air Ministry announced that the British Royal Naval Air Arm continued to attack targets in Italian territory.

One British aircraft did not return to base. In Tripoli, a ship and the pier where it was docked were heavily damaged by bombs, and the fire was very intense, visible from a distance an hour later. All British aircraft returned safely. (Reuter, 29th)</p>
<h3>Improved Relations Between the United States and the Soviet Union: Trade Expected to Develop</h3>
<p>Washington – Knowledgeable sources here today say that the foundation for improved U.S.-Soviet relations has been strengthened following the recent talks between U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles and Soviet Ambassador to the United States Oumansky.

<p>Capital Police Chief Dismissed</p>
<p>Bucharest – According to well-informed sources, the details of the massacre on the 27th are still unknown.

It is claimed that terrorists planned to occupy several houses in Brasov, D'Elno, Severin, and Clavoya. Terrorists and the army exchanged machine-gun fire, resulting in many casualties on both sides. It is claimed that the army is completely loyal to the government. Terrorists occupied the post office and telegraph office in Brasov but were driven out by convoys. It is claimed that terrorists concentrated in large numbers to occupy the two buildings. (According to news from Zurich, telephone communication between the Romanian capital and the Swiss capital has been cut off due to the "expansion of the unrest in the Romanian capital.") After the collective resignation of a large number of army generals, the Romanian government declared that those responsible for the vendetta will be severely punished.

<h3>The Underground Life of Londoners</h3>
<p>Glenner: "I was sitting on a mat in the basement, leaning against a pillow, listening to the nine o'clock news report on the wireless radio placed on my lap, when suddenly there was a deafening explosion. I thought I was surely going to die. I could hear the sounds of collapsing houses all around, especially above my house. In an instant, the basement ceiling shook, and the soil and plaster above it peeled off and fell to the ground. I thought the whole house was going to collapse and would surely collapse on top of me before I could escape. I was especially concerned about Mickey and the housekeeper. I wasn't sure if they were dead or injured. I remember hearing the housekeeper had been seriously injured. Within seconds, the housekeeper said to her husband on the phone, 'The house is in trouble because of the severe shock. I can't move. I have to leave and go elsewhere.' Then I remembered to put on my steel helmet. But because I was flustered, I couldn't find it for a moment. Suddenly, I realized it was still in my hand. Before going upstairs to fix the blackout curtains hanging in front of the window, I decided to check the two basement exits first. If the house wasn't stable, it might fall into the kitchen. My backside was already teetering, or it had already hit the teapot and was about to fall on Glenner's beloved little dog. The housekeeper was already preparing to escape from the basement. The bottom floor wind blew straight into the dining room because the large front door in the living room was tightly closed. I couldn't open the lock with a key. I ran towards the back door, which was also thrown to the other end of the house. But when I opened the door, dust rushed into my face, and the smoke and sulfur from the bomb explosion almost suffocated me. I dragged the housekeeper back to the kitchen and laid her flat on the floor to calm her down. I thought everything was over for us. I slammed the door shut and ran upstairs, thinking the worst had happened. The ceiling boards, bricks, and glass were blasted into the air, then fell down from the windows and roof. Streams of smoke and gunpowder filled the house. In desperation, the sound of explosions suddenly stopped. I heard Glenner's shouts from the darkness.</p>
<p>Mickey: "I changed into old pants, a wool vest, and a leather jacket. I was standing in the fourth-floor bathroom when suddenly, a warning whistle sounded. A terrible explosion occurred in the square in front of the house. The whole house was shaking there, and I stood motionless, like a wooden chicken. Although my mind kept telling me to go downstairs quickly, I still insisted on doing mechanical actions, flushing the toilet, buttoning my pants, and turning off the bathroom light, before finally running down three floors. I grabbed a flashlight on the table in the living room to see what was happening. We couldn't help but shout together: "An airplane!" That's right. It was the iron skeleton of a German Junkers bomber, about the size of a coffin. The wreckage looked like a car had been hit by a train. Suddenly, I heard a woman crying in the garden in the middle of the square. Mickey ran across the street to help her. The housekeeper and I went back into the door to avoid falling shrapnel."</p>
<p>Mickey: "I stumbled into the garden and saw a frightened woman in the middle of the garden, unable to reach the entrance of the public air raid shelter. She told me that she had just walked past the corner of the building three doors away, where the German plane had exploded, and had escaped unscathed. One bomb exploded as the German plane flew over the square. Another one landed, and the German plane itself exploded and fell on the roof of the house. I was so dazed that instead of taking her to the public air raid shelter, I took her across the street towards her house, which was already engulfed in flames along with several neighboring houses. I realized I had made a mistake and led her to the public air raid shelter. As I walked through the garden gate, I encountered two women wearing nightgowns and huddled in blankets. I led all three of them into the air raid shelter. After that, I ran back to my house. I saw wreckage of the German plane on the steps and decided to collect it as a souvenir of the night's disaster. Therefore, Glenner and I carefully carried a small gift from Göring into the living room."</p>
<p>Glenner: "A few minutes later, we gathered in the basement again. Soon after, we all agreed that because there were so many bombs dropped by the German plane near the burning target, there might still be unexploded time bombs hidden in the plane's wreckage. Perhaps our house would be bombed immediately. Under these circumstances, we couldn't wait to find a way to leave the house. We didn't stop to pack anything. Mickey and I had already steeled our hearts not to take the dog with us. But the housekeeper begged us to take the little dog with us, so we went upstairs again and led the dog down. Not far away, we saw the street covered with broken glass and fallen trees, so we had to carry the little dog in our arms."</p>
<p>Mickey: "We trudged along the street towards the train station, hoping to find a streetcar there. Under the bright flames, we could see groups of residents running out of the basements of their homes and heading towards the undamaged public air raid shelters in the square. Some people stood helplessly in the doorways, not knowing whether to risk crossing the street or stay in their threatened houses. Halfway to the station, a red light suddenly appeared at the corner of the street near where we were standing, illuminating everything as if it were daytime. From experience, I knew what was about to happen. Just as the bomb exploded, we crouched down in the doorway of a reinforced concrete building. Two storefronts away, the bomb hit the building directly. Fortunately, it was at the corner, and the blast didn't hit us. We quickly took steps forward and saw a lonely car in front of the station. The driver was willing to risk driving us to the Duchess Hotel. We couldn't help but shake his hand.</p>
<p>Glenner: "The hotel lounge was filled with social dignitaries and foreign diplomats. The big shots and semi-tycoons of London looked at us as if we were refugees from a concentration camp. As we were drinking in the bar, my hand inadvertently reached into my pocket. In a hypnotized gesture, I pulled out a teacup. I couldn't even remember taking it from home, but I must have unconsciously stuffed it into my pocket before leaving the air raid shelter, without a doubt. Life magazine photographer Vandyver and his wife were also staying at the hotel. They had moved out because their original place was near a time bomb. The couple joined us in celebrating our escape.

<p>London: Last night and this morning, Nazi planes continued their blitzkrieg against British seaports and food centers, launching a large-scale air raid on Liverpool, a town in Merseyside, and southwestern England. German planes also attacked Bristol and Southampton fiercely last night, with bomber fleets coming and going continuously, swarming like bees, dropping bombs everywhere, causing the bombed area to spread widely.

German pilots reported upon returning, "The whole city of Liverpool is in flames." It is said that gasoline pools, dock warehouses, granaries, power plants, etc., are all on fire. (United Press, 29th)</p>
<p>London: Today, London admitted that Liverpool and its suburbs had been heavily bombed by German planes from late last night until early this morning. It is said that this attack was the most intense since Liverpool was bombed. Concentrated German aircraft dropped hundreds of tons of high-explosive and incendiary bombs on the city. Allied planes from the Axis also participated in this attack. Several cities in the Midlands and on the west coast were also bombed. The number of dead and wounded is feared to be very high. This bombing is intended to retaliate against British air raids on Cologne. It is learned that the railway junction between Liverpool, Plymouth, and London was crippled by German planes early this morning. (International Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<p>Liverpool: From last night until this morning, continuous waves of large German planes wildly bombed Liverpool and the districts of Merseyside, as well as several northwestern towns, for more than eight hours. Although anti-aircraft guns resisted from time to time, most homes in several commercial properties and working-class areas were damaged. According to eyewitnesses, during the air raid, shrapnel fell in the streets like rain. It is reported that the losses do not seem very great, but the dead and wounded are feared to be very tragic. (United Press, 27th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command announced this afternoon that from last night until dawn today, German planes dropped several tons of high-explosive bombs on Liverpool at the mouth of the Mersey River. The city has turned into a fiery hell. It is said that the concentrated German attack on this important industrial city in central England aims to destroy the British shipping center. The German plane's fierce bombing of various centers in England, including the recent air raids on Portsmouth and Coventry, has crippled British shipyards. In the future, British ships that are damaged, and those that are severely damaged, must be sent to Canada for repairs. (International News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>London: The Air Ministry issued a report last night stating that there were no deaths or serious injuries in the UK during the day yesterday.

<h3>German Submarines Rampant, Intensifying the Naval Blockade of England, Food Shortages Feared on the British Isles, Authorities Advise People to Practice Frugality</h3>
<p>London: The German submarine and surface raider blockade of Britain's overseas supply has now reached an extremely tense level, leading British officials to announce yesterday that the government intends to expand food restrictions. Certain types of fruit will be completely banned, and meat imports will also be reduced. Food Minister Lord Woolton announced that during the winter milk shortage period, home milk supplies will be reduced across the board, except for maternity patients, children and those in hospital, because too many ships are being sunk, resulting in an extreme shortage of refrigerated transport, making it necessary to take drastic measures. This statement is consistent with the statement made on Wednesday by Minister without Portfolio, Greenwood, that British ship losses have surged. Mr. Wood said, "Many luxury items must disappear from the nation's tables. Apples, apricots, grapes, and other items unnecessary for a wartime population must be temporarily given up." Another step in the British reorganization of merchant ships can be seen in a recent announcement, namely that Greece has authorized its London committee to requisition Greek ships outside the eastern Mediterranean and Greek merchant ships over 4,000 tons in the eastern Mediterranean. Shipping circles now believe that Germany has at least two surface raiders, or perhaps more than two, outside the British Isles, two in the Atlantic, and one in the Indian Ocean. German submarines now have bases from Norway in the north to the Bay of Biscay in the south, and German naval attacks will become even more rampant in winter, because the days are short and the nights are long, making them easier to move around.

<h3>An Overview of Five Major Cultural Enterprises of the Catholic Church in China (3)</h3>
<p>The Beitang Library is one of the newest cultural enterprises of the Catholic Church in China. It was only established a few years ago, so it is not yet well-known. However, the history of its predecessor is quite long. Beitang is the largest main church in Beiping. However, today's Beitang Library is organized from the old library collections of Dongtang, Nantang, and Xitang. Among the four church libraries, Nantang is the oldest, established in the 18th year of the Wanli era of the Ming Dynasty (1600). The second oldest is Dongtang, established in the 7th year of the Shunzhi era of the Qing Dynasty (1650). Beitang was founded in the 25th year of the Kangxi era (23 years after 1700). Xitang also laid its foundation.</p>
<p>The history of the Beitang collection can be divided into four periods: (1) the period of separate collections in the four churches, from the initial establishment of each church to the 59th year of the Qianlong era (1785); (2) the early period of management by Jesuit priests, from the 50th year of the Qianlong era to the 7th year of the Daoguang era (1817); (3) the period of management by the Russian Orthodox Church, from the 7th year of the Daoguang era to the 10th year of the Xianfeng era (1860); (4) the later period of management by Jesuit priests, also known as the period of Beitang's sole collection, from the 10th year of the Xianfeng era to the present. From now on, it will enter the era of formal opening with modern scientific management, which is a new era in the history of the four church library collections. However, over the past 300 years, the four church library collections have also endured hardships. For example, Gengtang was originally the residence of many famous writers among the missionaries of the time, so there must have been many books left behind. Before 1651, Tang Ruowang (Johann Adam Schall von Bell) alone had over 3,000 volumes of books. However, when the missionaries encountered difficulties in the 17th year of the Jiaqing era (1812), the books were scattered in several places and eventually lost. The books of Xitang were stored in Nantang, so they were spared. In the 7th year of the Daoguang era, Bishop Pires entrusted all the books to Archbishop Vlcratchevitchll of the Orthodox Church. Thirteen years later, they were recovered. After repeated transfers, there were still some losses. During the religious persecution, the books of the churches were moved to the Zhengfu Temple in Pingxi and the Xiwanzhi Temple in Chahar, and were even buried underground, causing some to rot. There were also losses in the fire at Nantang in the 40th year of the Qianlong era (1775) and the fire at Dongtang in the 16th year of the Jiaqing era (1807). In the 12th year of the Guangxu era, the old Beitang (on the site of today's Zhongnanhai) was ceded to the Qing government. The new church was built in Waiku, and the books were also moved there, which is now the Beitang Library.</p>

<h3>East China Today vs. Western Police</h3>
<p>Starting at 2:30 PM at Recreation Ground, the final match of the first round of Group A. This year's participants in the Zilin Cup football tournament include 13 teams such as the Chinese United, Youyou, Yousheng, and the French Army. The opening ceremony will be held this afternoon, with two matches: French Army vs. Rowing and French Navy vs. Maccabi, both at the Racecourse. In terms of league matches, the perennial champion East China will face the Western Police in Group A at Recreation Ground, starting at 2:30 PM, with referee Shen Huichun. East China has already won six out of six matches in this group. Today is the final match of the first round. Although center Cai Shengfei cannot attend, Huang Kehou will be present, and with Han Longhai's full-court running, their strength has not been weakened. On the forward line, since Fei Chunhua took over the right wing, his performance has been excellent, making the attack much sharper. The Western Police have been bolstered by new players such as Fonseca this year, and they won several matches at the beginning, but ultimately their strength proved mediocre, and they lost two consecutive matches. Therefore, considering the continuation of the battle, East China has a good chance of defeating the Western Police and achieving seven wins in seven matches. The East China reserve team will also play against the North West Children's team at Jiaozhou Park. Today's tickets are 6 jiao and 1 yuan 1 jiao at Recreation Ground, and 3 jiao at Jiaozhou Park.

<h3>Food:</h3>
<h3>Rice, round-grained rice hindered from entering concession</h3>
<h3>Rumors fuel rice hoarding households</h3>
<h3>Foreign rice prices rise by one or two yuan, medicinal materials rise by four or five yuan</h3>
<h3>All due to poor environment caused by the current situation.</h3>
<p>Large quantities of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai today and tomorrow.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market yesterday experienced a great storm. In the early market, the "Nanjing recognition" issue caused wealthy people inside and outside the industry to absorb as much as possible, saying that the legal tender would have problems, and wanted to buy all the rice, which not only threatens the livelihood of the common people, but also seems to declare war on the common people. Later, it was rumored that domestic rice was blocked, and round-grained and glutinous rice prices rose, and foreign rice hoarders became more greedy. The price was kicked higher like a football. The current price of foreign rice in each store has been raised by more than one or two yuan. Foreign glutinous rice is affected by domestic glutinous rice and is particularly popular. The number one Saigon original package from Yinghua Company opened at 90 yuan the day before yesterday. Although there was a shout of 91 yuan, no transaction was made. Yesterday, it rose from 92.5 yuan to 93 yuan, and the December price was 92 yuan. The number two spot price was 89 yuan, and the December price was 96.5 yuan, which was two or three yuan higher than the day before yesterday. However, in the afternoon market, it was revealed that rice merchants had directly ordered thousands of tons from Myanmar and Yunnan. Also announced on the market was that Rixing Foreign Company had a deal of 1,000 tons of Xiaowen in January, at a price of 81 yuan. The market could no longer support it at this point. The December number one Saigon, which opened at 92 yuan in the morning, immediately dropped to 90 yuan in the afternoon. Other rice prices also dropped by one or two yuan. The spot price of each store also fell by one yuan or more. As a result, the current foreign rice was only about half a yuan higher than the night before, but those who wanted to sell foreign rice insisted and most refused to sell cheaply. Moreover, there were not many circulating chips on the market, so the transaction was less than 500 tons, while the spot goods were absorbed by large non-industry households, with transactions of no less than 20,000 bags, calculated as 78 yuan for number one Saigon, 74 yuan and 8 jiao for number two, followed by 73 yuan, 77 yuan to 74 yuan for Huojiao, 72.5 yuan for number two Siam, to 71.5 yuan, 71.8 jiao for Xiaojiao, to 71.5 yuan, 66 yuan to 64 yuan for Milu, and 62.5 yuan to 60 yuan for Suijian, 69 yuan to 68.5 yuan for Wuhu Jian.</p>
<p>The source of new Jingjian and Chazhi, etc., was cut off due to being blocked outside the boundary, resulting in an abnormal shortage among general cargo owners, and shopkeepers and customers, for fear of missing out, also competed to handle it regardless of the high price, which led to a sharp rise in medicinal materials of four or five yuan. Kaiyuan package was 90 yuan and 5 jiao, to 90 yuan, and Hujian was 88 yuan to 86.5 yuan. New Jing also rose by one or two yuan. The ordinary original package opened at 95 yuan, but Duyangjian was completely out of stock and there was no market.</p>
<p>In this favorable situation, glutinous rice followed suit, and the small, independent rice-carrying wine households were doing quite well. Moreover, large households continued to hoard, so the price also rose by one or two yuan. Guan Li Special Yuan had already sold for 90 yuan, and Zhongguan also needed 88 yuan. Hong Kong White Yuan was 79 yuan, followed by 76 yuan, and Nuo Tea was 66 yuan to 64.5 yuan.</p>
<p>A large batch of foreign rice will arrive in Shanghai today. The French ship "Paos" is directly transporting 1,600 tons of foreign rice from the West. Also, the "Albert SarTant" ship, managed by Hualun Foreign Company, is carrying 3,000 tons of foreign rice. According to the original schedule, it should have arrived yesterday, but there was no news until late at night. According to the company, it is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. Qiahe Foreign Company, Yongsheng Wheel, and Taikoo Company's Jialun Wheel are carrying foreign rice from Hong Kong to Shanghai, and are expected to enter the port today. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Australian Flour Road Goods Sold Off</h3>
<p>Flour Street Sales Limited to 8,000 Bags</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's spot flour transactions were quite active, but they were mainly foreign flour. Because Chinese flour factories only supply 8,000 bags to this street every day, it is not easy to buy them unless they are designated flour dealers. Therefore, foreign flour is the most noticed by this street. It is heard that the second batch of 30,000 bags of fixed flour has just arrived and is being unloaded. Most of the goods have been pre-sold, and the Australian flour that will arrive in early December has been selling off road goods for days. This street and customers are absorbing them one after another. Zhonglou, Huawu brand, etc., have all risen to 18 yuan and 8 jiao, with transactions of about 3,000 bags. The price of American foreign flour, Fushou brand, is 20 yuan, and the price of high-quality fresh goods is 19 yuan and 8 jiao to 19 yuan, 2 or 3 jiao. The market is becoming increasingly tight.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, there were still about two or three hundred bags from Su Kun and other places, all of which were sent to Japanese factories. Although Chinese factories are greedy, they still regret that there is no goods to receive. It is heard that the market price of Gaodu wheat is 29 yuan, but there are not many, and there are no suitable recipients. The ordering of foreign wheat is still under discussion.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Futures Have Been Abandoned</h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market lacked both buyers and sellers, resulting in a lack of activity in the market. However, Dalian soybean oil has been sold on the market by the adjustment members organized in the past. Because it is a test nature, the number is still small, and the overall situation has not been affected. Statistics show that 20 barrels of Dalian soybean oil were traded at a price of 103 yuan. 100 barrels were ordered for delivery in January at a price of 99 yuan, and 350 barrels were priced at 100 yuan. 30 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil were priced at 74 yuan and 5 jiao. 100 dan of Dayou Factory soybean oil were priced at 80 yuan. 100 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were priced at 74 yuan and 7.5 jiao to 74 yuan. 20 barrels of Qingdao raw oil were priced at 103 yuan. 700 barrels were ordered for delivery in late December at a price of 104 yuan and 7.5 jiao to 104 yuan.</p>
<h3>Finance: Japanese and American Merchants Sell Off, Foreign Exchange Turns From Tight to Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: HSBC's listed prices did not rise or fall. The dark market for British and American exchange rates was quite tight for forward contracts for a while. This is because most speculators still tend to buy, and the wind of buying is reduced after Hong Kong electricity is concluded. However, the American and Japanese banks are not lazy to supply, especially the Japanese bank Mitsui sold cheaply in the early morning, and the market turned from soft to hard. In the evening, the British and American exchange rates were stable.</p>
<h3>Speculators Tend to Buy</h3>
<p>In the early morning, the London big bar was flat for both near and far terms. London raw gold was fixed, and the exchange rate was flat against the United States and Shanghai. The United States was unchanged against the United Kingdom, down 5 points against Shanghai, and there was no market against France. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The banks opened with a spot selling price of 3 pence 71875 for British gold and 5.8125 for American exchange, the same as the closing price the night before. After opening, it was loose for a while. The Japanese bank came out and the foreign banks absorbed the American exchange for this month at 5 yuan 84375. After a while, speculators vigorously bought, and the market turned strong. The foreign banks' selling price for the next month was from 5 yuan 8125 to 75. The exchange rate did not change. The silver balance tax also did not rise or fall. Later, due to the return of speculators, the trend was slightly more convenient. The next month's speculators' selling price outside the bank was from 5 yuan 78125 to 84375. The Japanese bank Mitsui sold very smoothly. The foreign banks ate in December were all 5 yuan 84375. By noon, speculators also concluded the December American exchange at 5 yuan 84375. The closing spot price of British gold was 3 pence 71875 and the American exchange was 5 yuan 84375, flat with the morning opening for British and long 03125 for American.</p>
<h3>British and American Closing Prices Unchanged</h3>
<p>The later market was softened. This is because Hong Kong electricity is important and speculators continued to be strong in buying, but the American banks were willing to settle, and the price was still stable. At first, Sassoon Foreign Bank's current price was 3 pence 71875 for the first shilling. Later, Hong Kong Electric speculators entered the American Bank, and the American exchange for the next month was consistently 5 yuan 8125. The late closing price of British gold for term and spot was 3 pence 71875, and the American exchange was 5 yuan 8125, with no difference from the previous day's price.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong British Flat, American Stable</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 19th (Friday) electric, the exchange market opened this morning and reported half. The British-Shanghai futures and the spot price of the Japanese exchange rate did not rise or fall. The spot price of the American exchange rate was tight 0625, at 23 yuan 4375. The spot price of the Shanghai exchange rate rose by 5 yuan and a half, at 403 yuan and a half. At 10:00 am, the spot price of the Shanghai exchange rate fell back by 1 yuan and a half, at 401 yuan. At 10:15 am, it was flat.

At 11:30 am, it was flat, and all exchange rates did not change. At 2:30 pm, it was reported half, and the spot price of Shanghai exchange rate rose again by 5 jiao, at 401 yuan and 5 jiao, and the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Exchange Rates All Shrunk</h3>
<p>Tianjin, 29th (Friday) electric, the exchange market opened this morning and reported flat. The London telegraphic transfer was tight 03125, at 4 pence. The New York telegraphic transfer was tight 0625, at 6 yuan 28125. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by 6 jiao, at 92 yuan and 6 jiao. The "United Banknote" was implicitly unchanged, still at 86 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Economic Industry Talks (1) by Feng Liutang</h3>
<p>Opium</p>
<p>When it comes to opium, everyone knows that this is the biggest harm to weak China. However, the Chinese are really not afraid of death. They have been working hard on "fire inspection," and they are still lingering.</p>
<p>I don't want to talk about how opium affects people here, just talk about some opium stories briefly. There are still many old people who smoke opium now. I have never had opium in my life, so what I talk about is still a layman. If there are any places that are not comprehensive, please give me your advice.</p>
<p>Opium is a transliteration, translated from Opoum. When it first entered China, it is impossible to verify. However, I saw a record in the writings of a predecessor when I was a child, saying that it had already flowed in during the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty. Some say that Emperor Shenzong (Wanli) of the Ming Dynasty collapsed because Li Kezhuo, the Honglu Temple Qing, advanced the red pill. The red pill contained the reason for opium. "It is difficult for an immortal to know the matter of pills," let alone the pills in the palace, it is even more impossible to talk about, let's not talk about it for the time being.</p>
<p>Opium was already popular in China around the end of Qianlong. Because at this time, China was really the golden age of drumming and dancing, literary indulgence and martial play, extravagant desires, and that kind of leisure and refreshing goods were exactly what they liked. He Ci's father was when the British power gradually spread eastward. The East India Company obtained Bengal and other places in India. British merchants had already arrived in Ningbo. Although it was later prohibited, the British sent Macartney to the Qing court to seek trade. In the early years of Jiaqing, I saw the imperial edict prohibiting opium smoking, which shows that opium smoking had become widespread, so it was prohibited!</p>
<p>The Opium War was not a big deal for the British's purpose of trade; but it was a stain on his civilization after all. The author once said that the Opium War was a silver war. A few years ago, I thought about writing this because of the silver problem, but I finally didn't write it, because I don't want to write unless it is necessary these years. These few days, I am talking about the economic industry for the purpose of leaving it as a supplement.</p>
<p>How do you know that it is a silver war? It is not difficult to know from the situation of the barren silver at that time. Because opium requires white hardship, the more people who eat opium, the more silver flows out, but as a result of several defeats, opium has not been prohibited, but it is like mercury pouring on the ground, potassium holes cannot enter, and it has not been cleared for more than a hundred years. Drinking poison to quench thirst is very sad.</p>
<p>Because opium is imported from abroad, most of it is operated by Guangdong gangs, especially people from Chaoshan and other places. Generally, it is called earth. What is the meaning of earth? Some people say that the poppy is refined into a slurry, which is mixed with earth and then sold; others say that the big earth is round, like the earth of the God of Tai Sui that the Chinese people passed down, it is also a rolling circle, so it is named earth. It is probably closer to the earth of mud, because when boiling opium smoke, there are always head and slag according to. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Gold Market Meets High Prices, Not Lacking Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market, dark market, was the last day for the second cash futures transaction. The trend revolved around the American market. However, when the market opened in the morning, a securities firm ignored the high or low prices and actually sold 300 taels at the opening price, causing the upward trend to fall sharply to a low price of 5,730 yuan. However, because the foreign exchange rate was soft, gold and silver firms rushed to buy in soon. The firm also came to reinvest because the price it sold was too low, and the price suddenly flew up to 5,780 yuan. As the American exchange rate fell, it was seen on the market again at noon. In the afternoon, it once rose to a high price. Later, it was heard that the buyer had to pay about 5 yuan for the swap this morning, and the wind of coming out of the cage was more prevalent, so the father's plate fell, and finally it was 5,763 yuan, 27 yuan less than the rolling. The total transaction was about 5,000 taels. The cash price was 2 yuan lower than the futures price. The gold firm sold dozens of taels to a certain silver building. Gold for jewelry and customs gold remained flat.</p>
<h3>Red Small Read 7 Yuan</h3>
<p>In the early morning, many long-term households were prepared to sell at high prices, because the rise on the previous day was late, and a certain securities gang first sold two or three hundred taels, and the opening fell by five or sixty yuan. It is estimated that the gold firm paid 20 taels for the exchange industry, which was 5,730 yuan. The silver gang took the opportunity to absorb it at a low price and raised it by 50 yuan. It is estimated that the securities gang entered the silver firm 30 taels, 5,780 yuan. However, the gold and silver firms set off a selling wind again, and at this time, the buyer's line wavered, and the price fell. The money exchange industry did 30 taels, only 5,736 yuan.

<p>The securities market, yesterday the market was extremely chaotic, the rumors were complicated, and the advantages and disadvantages were indistinguishable. On the one hand, the rumors of continued loans from the United States were very strong. On the other hand, the rumors in Nanjing were becoming more and more true. At the same time, the old stories of issuing treasury bills were revived. Speculators were lost in this variety of situations and lost their common strength.

<h3>Yarn Flower: Around the End of the Year, Cotton Yarn Is Still Seen in the Market</h3>

People's hearts were timid, and most of them sold short and looked small. The place has been as peaceful as usual, and the cargo transportation is as smooth as usual. Therefore, the thoughts of the multi-party have improved, and at the same time, the Hong Kong gang's purchases have progressed, so the market has recovered. However, some people think that around the end of the year, it is still in the market. The fundamental problem is still the first key to actual sales.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Nanjing Train Hit Landmine: 150 Dead and Injured. Derailment Near Waikatang. Five Train Cars Reportedly Completely Destroyed.</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9:30 AM, a passenger train traveling from Shanghai North Station to Nanjing derailed near Waikatang, east of Suzhou and west of Weiting. As a result, many passenger cars were destroyed. It is reported that the incident resulted in approximately 100 or more deaths and injuries. Shanghai-Nanjing rail traffic was thus suddenly interrupted yesterday.</p>
<p>Two Americans Seriously Injured</p>
<p>Late last night, this newspaper obtained reliable information from foreign sources stating that the express train traveling from Shanghai to Nanjing yesterday morning was derailed by a landmine explosion near Suzhou. At the time, the front several passenger cars immediately fell to the side of the road. The detailed circumstances of the accident are still awaiting further reports, but it is known that 150 passengers were killed or injured. Among them were two Americans who were also seriously injured. Whether reporter Mu Neng can confirm that there was also one Japanese person injured, whose identity is unknown.</p>
<p>Explosion Near Suzhou from Landmine</p>
<p>The English-language "The China Press" reported that around 10:00 AM this morning (29th), a special train heading to Nanjing, carrying many passengers, including dozens of Japanese officials, was on its way to Nanjing to participate in the signing of the "treaty" on the 30th when it hit a landmine and exploded near Suzhou, resulting in more than one hundred deaths and injuries. The landmine was placed on the tracks five miles from Suzhou, and detonated upon contact. Five train cars were completely destroyed, with fragments flying hundreds of yards away.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Admits Accident</p>
<p>It is believed that the train in question departed from Shanghai at 8:50 AM and was carrying a large number of Japanese officials and some foreigners. The details of the explosion are not yet known. It is generally believed that the landmine was placed by Chinese guerrillas. Japanese officials in this city are maintaining strict silence on the matter, but have also admitted that "something happened." After the accident, trains to Nanjing were temporarily suspended. It is said that there will be no further train service today.</p>
<p>At Least One Hundred Dead and Injured in Explosion</p>
<p>A certain foreigner in this city planned to depart for Nanjing near noon. According to him, the train he was supposed to take was held up at the North Station for half an hour. A station clerk then informed the passengers that a train had derailed near Suzhou, so the train could not depart and there would be no trains from Shanghai to Nanjing today. A reporter contacted the Suzhou Railway Station by telephone this afternoon and learned that at least one hundred people were killed or injured in the explosion, and it is expected that many of the injured will not survive. As for the identities of the senior Japanese officials on the destroyed train, it is not yet known.</p>
<h3>Cold Weather Arrives: Winter Relief Efforts Intensify</h3>
<p>Deep winter has arrived, and the severe cold is pressing upon us. Coupled with the high rice prices, the number of impoverished people freezing and starving to death on the streets is approaching one hundred per day, according to a report from the Pushen Villa, and countless others are on the verge of death. The first step in the winter relief efforts of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association is to prepare a shelter to protect against the cold and accommodate the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphans. They have already rented a vacant lot at the Yan Family Residence on Diefeng Road, and are currently rushing to build mat sheds and sew cotton quilts and clothing in preparation for accommodating refugees. The shelter can accommodate approximately 2,000 people. This project is expected to be completed in three weeks, and then they will begin registering refugees for admission. The accommodation period will run from mid-December to the end of March next year, when the weather warms up.</p>
<p>Piles of Bodies Frozen to Death</p>
<p>The weather had been warm for several days, but it suddenly turned cold yesterday morning, causing many helpless impoverished people who were sleeping in the alleys to freeze to death due to hunger and cold. The Tongren Fuyuan Hall in the French Concession received telephone reports from various police stations and shopkeepers from morning to night, requesting that they collect over a dozen male and female corpses, especially children, close to twenty corpses. Previously, the hall handled the collection of corpses found on the road, with the expenses covered by rental income from real estate. Since the war, most of the hall's real estate has been in the occupied areas, and for more than three years, there has been no income. As a result, funding for this charitable undertaking is extremely tight, relying entirely on temporary donations. It is hoped that the charitable people of Shanghai will generously donate to sustain this good deed.</p>
<p>Account Statement Published</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, which is currently responsible for the food, medicine, and other expenses of more than 14,000 refugees in this city, published its income and expenditure figures for May yesterday. The total income from donations was 411,355.78 yuan, and the total expenditure was 379,608.63 yuan. The balance at the end of this month (i.e., the end of September) was 31,747.15 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>City's Cold Weather Clothing Donation Collection Deadline Today</h3>
<p>Various Sectors Handling Collection and Submission Procedures</p>
<p>The city's cold weather clothing donation campaign, since the solicitation and consolation donation committee promoted solicitation in various sectors, people from all sectors have been united, actively donating, and various groups and organizations have worked together to assist in the promotion, resulting in significant achievements exceeding the recognized targets. The association has been ordered to end the process today, and will not continue. It also limits all fundraising groups and collecting agencies to complete all collection and submission procedures within the next week, so that the entire report can be submitted and concluded as soon as possible. The receipt stubs and fundraising report forms provided by the association to various sectors will be collected and verified in their entirety. After the conclusion, the enthusiastic groups and those with outstanding achievements will be reported to the central government for special commendation in accordance with the solicitation and reward regulations.</p>
<h3>Zhu Boquan Abducted Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a kidnapping occurred at Haige Road and Yidingpan Road. The victim was an important figure in the financial world. The circumstances and public sentiment are described below.</p>
<p>Employed Bodyguard</p>
<p>Zhu Boquan, a native of Nanxun in his forties, is currently the manager of the Shanghai Bankers Association Joint Federation Preparatory Committee. His Shanghai residence is at No. 640 Fanyuan, Haige Road, West Shanghai. Because Zhu is usually busy with work, he has a private car, license plate number 8, and employs a bodyguard to accompany him for protection.</p>
<p>Abducted En Route</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Zhu left home with his bodyguard, intending to go out to work. However, when the car passed Haige Road and Yidingpan Road, three kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, each holding a box gun, blocking the way. Then they jumped into the car and kidnapped Zhu and the car together, disappearing without a trace. After the police received the report, they immediately dispatched officers to investigate and have ordered a thorough investigation. As for Zhu, his bodyguard, driver, and car, there is still no news of their whereabouts.</p>
<h3>Meilehe Returns to Shanghai from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Meilehe, the Inspector-General of Customs, left Shanghai on a ship for the Philippines on the 19th of this month. It is now reported that Meilehe arrived in Hong Kong from the Philippines early in the morning. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Hong Kong by ship today and should arrive in Shanghai tomorrow or the day after.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Off the Coast of Shipu Shoot at the Coastline</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry news, a Japanese warship anchored off the coast of Shipu opened fire on the shore with machine guns at around 9:00 AM on the 28th. At that time, the Chinese garrison also fired back with machine guns, and the fighting was intense, with the sound of gunfire as dense as linked beads. At 10:45 AM, the Japanese warship was unable to withstand and fled north. The Chinese side suffered no losses. At 12:30 PM, another Japanese warship sailed into Shipu and anchored off Dongmenkou, but took no unusual actions.</p>
<h3>Approved by the Public Works Department: Additional Allowance for Chinese Constables; Retroactive Payment from November; Chinese Constables Generally Satisfied and Working as Usual</h3>
<p>Following a request for salary increases by 195 Chinese constables from the Jing'an Temple, Gordon Road, Putuo Road, Xinzha Road, and Chengdu Road police stations in the Public Concession on the 1st, the police authorities swiftly addressed the matter. Considering the hardships of the Chinese constables and promising to make amends, the constables expressed satisfaction and resumed their duties as usual, faithfully performing their tasks. Yesterday's situation was excellent, with everything proceeding as before and no unexpected incidents. The details of the housing allowance approved by the Public Works Department are as follows:</p>
<p>Approved Additional Housing Allowance</p>
<p>The Public Works Department has recently approved an additional housing allowance for the Chinese constables in the patrol division, effective from November: (1) For mounted constables: A. Married and not residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $11.50 to $24 per month; B. Unmarried and residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $9 to $18 per month; C. Married and residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $9 to $18 per month. (2) For Chinese patrol sergeants: A. Married and not residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $14 to $26 per month; B. Unmarried and not residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $10.50 to $20 per month; C. Married and residing in the police station dormitory, the allowance increases from $10.50 to $20 per month. (3) Acting patrol sergeants and training patrol sergeants receive the same treatment as patrol sergeants.</p>
<p>Request Deemed Reasonable</p>
<p>Mr. Bavin, head of the Public Works Department's police division, stated to reporters that the Chinese constables are working as usual today, and everything is very calm. The Chinese constables now feel satisfied because the authorities have agreed to a pay increase, which has eliminated their dissatisfaction. Such events often have the potential to escalate into major strikes. However, the Chinese constables' request this time did not involve any actions that were opposed by him. In fact, he is willing to listen to any grievances the Chinese constables may have. Fortunately, the Chinese constables' work stoppage did not exceed ten minutes or a quarter of an hour. The authorities will increase the Chinese constables' income by raising the housing allowance, which will be calculated and paid retroactively from November 1st.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Silk Factories Completely Shut Down</h3>
<p>It has been almost two months since the Japanese warships blockaded the coastal ports of Zhejiang and Fujian, resulting in the inability to transport local products from the interior and the lack of imported goods from other ports. This has disrupted the balance of supply and demand. Tea cocoons are a specialty of Zhejiang Province, and their annual output is the largest in the province. However, since the Japanese warships blockaded the coast, the products cannot be transported out, leading to a complete cutoff of raw materials for the silk factories in Shanghai. All existing inventory has also been completely used up. Therefore, all silk factories have declared a complete shutdown and must wait for the raw materials to arrive before resuming operations. The Zhejiang Provincial Government is planning to establish large-scale silk reeling factories to provide relief to silkworm farmers, which may be realized next year.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Increases Issuance of Dime Notes</h3>
<p>Total Issue of $500,000; Initial Issue of $100,000</p>
<p>The difficulty of making small change in Shanghai has been completely eliminated since the Central Bank and the Central Mint successively issued large amounts of fractional notes and aluminum coins, providing ample supply. However, there is a severe shortage of dime notes due to the large demand, especially for one- and two-dime notes. This has led many tobacco and exchange shops to deliberately raise prices and purchase them at a premium, ranging from $1.60 to $2.00 or more per hundred yuan. The China Farmers Bank is currently continuing to issue large batches of new 25-cent and 50-cent notes for circulation in the market. The Bank of China has also recently increased the issuance of new five-yuan and ten-yuan notes, as well as new twenty-cent notes. It is reported that the total amount of the dime notes reaches 500,000 yuan and have been shipped to Shanghai. In addition to the initial issuance of 100,000 yuan, the remaining amount will be issued in stages to circulate in the market, in order to alleviate the panic of finding small change.</p>
<h3>British Nationals in Tianjin and Shanghai Eager to Serve Their Country</h3>
<p>Eighteen to Join the Army in India; Saving on Christmas to Support the Troops</p>
<p>A group of over ten British nationals in Shanghai recently left Shanghai on the SS Sibajak, bound for Hong Kong and then the British territories in the Far East to join the army. This includes ten British nationals from Shanghai: Leslie, Harris, Wills, Dobson, Reid, Brown, Mahler, Hebard, Hoover, and Pullen. In addition, there are eight people who transferred from Tianjin to Shanghai to enlist: Satterson, Barkinhorn, Turner, Fener, McShea, and Clark. It is reported that they will join the Royal Air Force of the British Army in India. Before their departure from Shanghai, all their relatives and friends went to the Jianghai Customs Wharf to see them off.</p>
<p>Christmas is fast approaching. The British nationals in this port, due to the ongoing war in their home country, will not hold extravagant celebrations this year. The Shanghai British War Relief Fund has launched a Christmas troops support campaign from the 10th of this month to the 9th of December, collecting various comfort items to send to the homeland to comfort the British army, navy, and air force. The British War Savings Committee is calling for saving on Christmas expenses and promoting war bonds to help the homeland's war effort. The British Association has also sent letters to British nationals, calling for the suspension of celebration ceremonies and the transfer of celebration expenses to the war fund to aid refugees.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ships Anchored in Hong Kong; Nippon Yusen Kaisha Has Not Acknowledged It Yet, But Says All Ships Will Sail the Manila Route</h3>
<p>According to the Zilin Daily, yesterday (the 28th), the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun evening edition published that Hong Kong is the outpost of the United Kingdom in the Far East, and is rapidly presenting the state of a military port. At the same time, due to the extremely limited import and export business, the importance of Hong Kong as a commercial port is reduced. Nippon Yusen Kaisha has decided that all its ships will no longer stop at Hong Kong, but will change the route to Manila as the end point of its trans-Pacific route. Also, according to the English-language Great America Evening Post, Nippon Yusen Kaisha has denied that all its ships will not call at Hong Kong. It is said that the company's direct Shanghai-Manila route will be opened on December 11. All ships will dock in Hong Kong on the way back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>British Ships Strengthen Safety Equipment</p>
<p>Since the German ship "Athens" was converted into a cruiser in Kobe, Japan, the British naval authorities have ordered all shipping companies to strictly take precautions in accordance with wartime laws. The schedules of ships are strictly prohibited from being announced. Recently, the Hong Kong Shipping Administration also issued an order to British merchant ships to strengthen radio and signal equipment. Any accidents that occur during the voyage should be reported to the British naval authorities at any time. Secondly, British merchant ships have automatically strengthened life-saving equipment and configured a large number of lifeboats to protect the safety of passengers and crew.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Sets Five Measures to Strengthen Currency Confidence</h3>
<p>In order to strengthen the circulation of legal tender in Shanghai and the credit of legal tender in the guerrilla areas, the Ministry of Finance, after repeated consideration and research, has decided on five measures, which have been ordered to be followed: (1) Maintain the circulation of legal tender in Shanghai and maintain the credit of legal tender in the guerrilla areas. (2) Omitted. (3) Strictly prevent the absorption of Chinese materials. (4) Order the competent authorities in various places to strictly prevent and ban the circulation of banknotes issued without approval. (5) A letter to propaganda organizations in various provinces should publicize that banknotes issued without approval have no reserve credit, and people should uniformly refuse to use them.</p>
<h3>No News of the Haifukumaru; Shipping Industry Concerned</h3>
<p>The German merchant ship Haifukumaru, of the Reiss &amp; Co., has already sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou and entered the Ou River. However, more than a month has passed, and the whereabouts of the ship are unknown. According to the Datong News Agency, the ship left the Ou River more than ten days ago, which has been confirmed by a telegram from the Wenzhou Haifukumaru office. There is no news about the whereabouts after leaving Wenzhou. Therefore, the customs declaration industry is rumored that the ship has been detained in Dinghai. However, judging from the fact that it has not arrived in Shanghai for more than ten days, the ship may have been detained, but it is not known where it is detained. It is suspected that the ship's radio has been monitored. Therefore, although the Shanghai company has been constantly calling by radio, there is no reply, which is very concerning.</p>
<h3>French Concession Housing Regulations; Seeking Agreement from the Consular Body; Whether It Is Considered a Kind of Police Law; Should Be Discussed at Length by Nationals of All Countries</h3>
<p>French Magistrate Sheke, Resident in Shanghai, President of the French Concession Housing Rent Research Committee, recently drafted a decree on housing regulations in the Concession, in order to eliminate the malpractices of collecting small rents, and has sent letters to the British, American, and Italian magistrates resident in Shanghai, and the consuls of Belgium, Japan, and the Netherlands, asking them about their attitude towards this draft, in order to decide whether to recognize the draft as a police law, or whether it is attached to the national law of each country, and whether the civil laws that cannot be implemented in Shanghai must be modified. If the above draft can be regarded as a police law, then French Consul General Magre has the right to issue this decree, because the French Concession Police Department is under the jurisdiction of Magre. If the consulates do not recognize the draft as a police law, then the relevant authorities of each country must discuss it at length. It is expected that the French Concession Housing Rent Committee will soon receive replies from the consulate authorities, and then decide whether to submit the draft decree to the French Consul General for approval. The Public Concession authorities have adopted a wait-and-see attitude on this issue, and will study it carefully before discussing whether it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Pei'en Apartments Forcing Tenants to Move Out</p>
<p>Pei'en Apartments on Xiafei Road, which has a total of 110 tenants, has been notified separately by the apartment manager and the Pu Yi Real Estate Company that they must move out before January 1st of next year, with threatening words attached. It is reported that the apartment is the property of a wealthy Chinese businessman in Hong Kong. The tenants and Pu Yi Real Estate Company have been arguing about rent increases for several months. The landlord side demanded a rent increase of 35 yuan per room per month, but the tenants only agreed to a rent increase of 10 yuan. This matter was originally considered to be over two weeks ago. Unexpectedly, the real estate company then asked each tenant to sign a lease, with a valid period of only one year. The tenants did not agree, so the real estate company threatened them with an order to move out.</p>
<h3>Applying for Entry Passports to Various Countries Requires Purchase of Savings Bonds</h3>

<h3>Hongqiao Road Telephone Line Cut Again</h3>
<p>Over Two Hundred Feet Stolen; Should Be Repaired Last Night</p>
<p>The telephone line laid by the Shanghai Telephone Company in the Hongqiao area has recently been coveted by petty thieves, resulting in frequent thefts.

On the morning before, the telephones in the Luobiegen Road and Hongqiao Road area of Hongqiao were cut off again due to the theft of the telephone line. At that time, the police arrested a suspect, but the thief escaped after cutting off about 220 feet of telephone line, including 101 pairs of wires.

<h3>Pingyao Continues to Run; The Public Works Department Watches Rice Prices and Makes Preparations</h3>
<p>Since the Pingxian Committee was officially established on January 5 this year, it has held seven phases of Pingxian rice. Due to insufficient funds, it was originally planned to end the management from the seventh phase. However, the committee witnessed the soaring rice prices and the difficulty of the people's livelihood. In order to carry out its original intention and to follow the intentions of the authorities, it decided to continue to run tribute rice Pingyao to help the people in their urgent needs.</p>
<p>Pingyao Date</p>
<p>In order to negotiate specific methods, the Ping Committee held a temporary standing committee meeting at the Shipping Club on Guangdong Road at 3 pm the day before yesterday. The chairman, Yu Qiaqing, first reported the purpose of the meeting and the planning and implementation. After discussion, in order to cope with the winter relief, the eighth phase of Pingyao will be continued in the early December of the lunar calendar, in order to help the people spend the remaining winter in hardship. However, a lot of money is needed. I hope that people from all walks of life and industry associations will continue to contribute to gather strength and work together for good deeds. As for the detailed methods, they are still to be revised.</p>
<p>Authorities Making Preparations</p>
<p>Yesterday, rice market rumors were out of control, and the gray market for domestic rice even shouted a high price that was difficult to explain. It is heard that rice merchants can make a profit of more than 20 yuan per bag. According to foreign reports, the rising rice prices in Shanghai are currently being closely watched by the Public Works Department regarding the development of the war on the border between Vietnam and Thailand. If the war expands, it will be necessary to import rice from Hong Kong and Rangoon to prevent food shortages, or it may be necessary to limit the sale of stored rice according to the population. Yesterday, more than 15,000 bags of foreign rice and 1,000 bags of domestic rice arrived in the city, so the rice price shouted high in the front market, and finally reported a return to stability in the back market.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Has Not Issued Political Telegrams Recently</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the matters currently handled by the association are mostly within the scope of commercial proof and investigation, and no political telegrams have been issued recently.</p>
<h3>Rotary Club Toy Hospital Collects Children's Toys</h3>
<p>Give Poor Children a Happy Christmas</p>
<p>Since its establishment in 1931, the Rotary Club Toy Hospital in this port has collected a large number of toys every Christmas and donated them to poor children. However, because the number of children is extremely large, all the toys are not enough to distribute. This year's Christmas is fast approaching. In order to make up for the shortcomings, the hospital issued an appeal to people from all walks of life the day before yesterday to actively donate toys. All new and old, good and bad books or toys are welcome. Because the hospital has a repair department, all damaged toys can be restored to their original condition for donation to children to celebrate Christmas. If you want to donate, please send them to the Rotary Club at the Duchen Hotel on Fuzhou Road, 1198 Jing'an Temple Road, 774 Xiafei Road, the West YMCA at 150 Jing'an Temple Road, or call 34120 and someone will be sent to collect them immediately.</p>
<h3>China One Trust Company Reduces Interest Rates on Current Deposits</h3>
<p>In the second half of this year, the market has been flooded with funds, and various banks have successively reduced interest rates on current deposits. It is heard that China One Trust Company has reduced the interest rate on various current deposits by one percent from November 1.</p>
<h3>Shanghai YMCA Winter Clothing Donations Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>More Than 6,000 Yuan Has Been Received and Sewing Has Started, Donations Continue to Be Accepted</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai YMCA began to raise donations for winter clothes for the poor in Shanghai, people from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated money, and more than 6,000 yuan has been received. In addition to urging charitable people from all walks of life to continue donating money to benefit the poor, the association has also organized a special committee to design and purchase materials and began to prepare them. They will be distributed to the poor when it is severely cold. At present, the main focus is on children. It has been learned that the association's clothing-making method is extremely novel. It is inviting family members of members and female leaders to voluntarily make them in groups at the Xuegeng Hall of the association from 3 pm on December 4, and can also take them back to sew or donate money for labor. It is found that the severely cold date is approaching, and I hope that all sectors will donate funds as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Hong Xianfang Passed Away, Memorial Service Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Hong Xianfang of Jiaochuan, who has served as a compradore of the Shanghai Race Club for more than 30 years, was kind and diligent, and everyone was happy to associate with him. He has contributed a lot to social undertakings and has spared no effort in promoting sports. He unfortunately passed away on the 28th of last month. Tomorrow (December 1st) will be the 57th day of his death. The family respectfully follows his last words and holds a memorial service and family sacrifice at the Fazang Temple on Jiale Road in the French Concession. It is also heard that the Siming Guildhall and the Longevity Association will launch a public sacrifice for him on the 22nd of next month (Winter Solstice in the lunar calendar).</p>
<h3>Paper Hunt Club Explains the Truth About Farmers Obstructing</h3>
<p>Farmers Demanded Too Much, Changed the Route, Which Caused Misunderstanding But Was Not Serious</p>
<p>The Shanghai Paper Hunt Club wrote to this newspaper yesterday: Dear Editors of Shen Bao, I respectfully start by saying, regarding the news about the Paper Hunt Club published in your newspaper the other day, which is quite different from the facts, I, as the president of the Paper Hunt Club, in order to clarify the truth, respectfully describe the beginning and end of the incident as follows, please publish it in your newspaper to correct the situation. According to the dispute that occurred with the farmers at the end point of the paper hunt race last Sunday, the reason is that the paper scattering route led by me was one that had never been used before. If someone had warned our club about the farmers in the area in advance and objected to it, we would have changed the route to avoid it. It was only after investigation that we learned that the crux of the dispute was due to the following reasons:</p>
<p>Initially, I originally wanted the paper hunt route to pass through the village about three miles north of the marsh at the end point of Asanuma, because the residents of the village demanded excessive prices for the highway passing through the village, so the bridge slightly west of the road was used instead. Therefore, some of the villagers in the village incited the crowd, either because their demands were not met, and deliberately made trouble. That afternoon, several people from the village came to our association, expressed regret, and the village chief explained that they actually wanted donations from the Paper Hunt Club to repair a nearby stone bridge.</p>
<p>Farmers Have Always Been Positive About the Club</p>
<p>We rely entirely on the consent and goodwill of the farmers to hold paper hunt races. There are many ways for farmers to stop the paper hunt. At first, there is no need to throw bricks and stones, or use poles and sticks. The policy of our club has always been cautious. If the farmers really strongly reject the paper hunt, then the area will be avoided and not violated. In fact, the farmers do welcome our club, but only need to pay a fee for passing through. For example, the small beach used by us for jumping is also built by the villagers. Most of it is built by our club's workers, but without the permission of the landowners, how can the workers do it?</p>
<p>No One Embezzles the Price Given</p>
<p>A certain interviewer claimed that most of the compensation paid by our club to the farmers was embezzled by people, and the real landowners did not get anything. Even if they got it, they would be seized by the local tyrants afterwards. However, I have often walked through the countryside with servants for twenty miles last winter and this spring, personally distributing compensation to the villagers and landowners. There is no indirect procedure in this, so it can be believed that the money has indeed entered the hands of the landowners. Other children distribute in other areas, just like what I did. Not only that, the Chinese directors and Chinese members of our club have also contributed a lot to this work.</p>
<p>It is Impossible to Impersonate</p>
<p>All the villagers who receive money have a roster, which is checked every year to prevent omissions. When paying the money, there are many villagers watching, so it is impossible to impersonate or falsely claim to be a landowner and try to swallow it up. Moreover, the village chiefs can often express cooperation, so there should be no confusion among the villagers. It is likely that the villagers who caused the trouble in the area did not understand our compensation method.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Damage to Gardens</p>
<p>It is quite wrong for someone to point out that we hunted in gardens with densely planted vegetables, because we will try our best to avoid fields planted with vegetables. When it is impossible to avoid, we stop moving forward and take a detour. Accidental trampling is sometimes unavoidable, but the damage is very small, and we must make every effort to compensate for the damage. With this, I respectfully ask for your editor's blessing. J.H.Liddell, President of the Shanghai Paper Hunt Club, November 29, 1940.</p>

<h3>Accusation of Fraudulent Acquisition of Property Against Yuande Money Exchange</h3>
<p>Setting up a fictitious firm for speculative trading, fraudulently obtaining guarantee deposits, request to return to Shanghai</p>
<p>Recently, speculative ventures and silver firms have been established in this city like mushrooms after rain. Upon closer inspection, they are nothing more than specialized businesses dealing in margin calls and stock speculation. Huang Rongnian and Huang Aitang, father and son, managers of Yuande Money Exchange at 209 Beijing Road, along with Bao Tingcai of Xiechang Firm at 102 Renji Road, Wu Renji of Yongfuhe Firm on Shandong Road, Xia Dafang of Shuxing Construction Factory on Shanzhong Road and Hegong Road, Hu Shouqing of Kangsheng Foreign Firm on the Bund of Simalu, and Liu Jinbo, an accountant in the accounting department of the China Industrial Bank on Bowuyuan Road, have recently been sued in the criminal division of the First Special Court by Lu Jifu, residing at 19 Jifu Lane, Ximen Road, and Zhu Gengxin of Xinyi Company at 44 Yanghang Street, through their lawyer, Li Baosen, alleging</p>
<p>Fictitious Money Exchange</p>
<p>fraudulently obtaining property. The main points of the indictment are that the defendants, etc., fictitiously established Yuande Money Exchange at 209 Beijing Road, with the Huang father and son as managers. Yan Zhou, a runner for the exchange, solicited speculative business from the plaintiffs, etc. The plaintiffs, etc., unaware of the empty shell of the exchange, were temporarily misled. Lu Jifu then opened a trading account in the name of Lu Jiji on April 11th of this year, entrusting the exchange to deposit a total of three thousand yuan in guarantee deposits under the pretext of purchasing margin calls. Although the exchange claimed to have made profits, it was all just on paper and could not be cashed out. When he demanded repayment, although they promised to pay two thousand yuan, one thousand yuan was in the form of a promissory note that could not be cashed. One thousand yuan and a profit of four hundred yuan and ninety-two cents were not paid. Zhu Gengxin's portion was delivered in the name of Xinji, amounting to US dollars converted to national currency of 17,530 yuan and 8 jiao, plus 714 yuan and 5 jiao and 2 fen in Xinji's national currency account.</p>
<p>Upon Discovering the Deception</p>
<p>demands for repayment proved futile. Although one-tenth was later paid, as of May 2nd, 652 yuan and 1 jiao and 2 fen remained in Zhu Gengji's account, and 15,777 yuan and 8 jiao remained in Xinji's account, which were not paid. The contents of Yuande Exchange were hollow, completely pretending to conduct margin call transactions, fraudulently obtaining guarantee deposit funds, harming financial society. In addition to requesting legal punishment, a civil suit is attached, requesting joint and several compensation, etc. This case was heard yesterday morning in the Eighth Criminal Court by Judge Zhong, where only Huang Aitang and his lawyer appeared in court to respond to the suit. After the interrogation, the matter was postponed for further review.</p>
<h3>Discovery of an Englishman's Corpse on North Sichuan Road: Cause of Death is Heart Failure</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that at 8:32 yesterday (the 28th) morning, the body of a Westerner was suddenly discovered in Lane 59 of North Sichuan Road (near Tiantong Road). There were no papers on his person bearing his name. The police department broadcast a description of the deceased's appearance. Subsequently, a friend of the deceased identified him as an Englishman named McPartland, born in the Arle district of Scotland, aged 65. He was formerly an officer in the British Army and has now retired with no profession. He came to Shanghai about two years ago and lived alone in Room 614 of the Naval Young Men's Association. He had no relatives in Shanghai. After the body was discovered, it was moved to the Public Concession Hospital, where it was determined that the cause of death was heart failure. The deceased's friend also knew that he had a history of heart disease, so the body was not inspected.</p>
<h3>Summary of Robbery Cases</h3>
<p>A public bus No. 10 running to the west of Shanghai on Yanping Road, at around 3:10 pm yesterday, when it reached Kanglatuo Road and Yanping Road, unexpectedly had four bandits on board. One of them produced a handgun and robbed another man of 35 yuan in national currency.</p>

<h3>Zhang Gunian Returns to Shanghai to Paint Porridge Paintings</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Gunian is the nephew of Mr. Feng Chaoran. He studied painting with his uncle from a young age and was intelligent, so he fully inherited his uncle's teachings. His works have long been highly regarded. In recent years, he has been working in the banking industry in Chongqing, Hong Kong, and other places, and has been tied down by his work, unable to concentrate on painting. Those who requested Mr. Zhang to paint continued to arrive. Mr. Zhang, realizing that it was difficult to balance both, resigned from his banking position, closed his doors to paint, and fulfilled the needs of his friends. Those who love Mr. Zhang's ink paintings will be able to have their wishes fulfilled.</p>
<h3>Youlian Radio Station's Famous Opera Singer Broadcasts</h3>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding a news item in your local news column entitled "Our Home Robbed, Losses Amounting to Over Three Thousand Gold" which does not fully align with the facts. According to the check on the number of robberies yesterday, in addition to the five hundred yuan of cash, the jewelry and other items were approximately one thousand yuan. The damage suffered was not as large as reported in your newspaper. My family is not rich and is rather in outward show only. Anyone who knows us knows that we aren't really wealthy. The robbery took almost all the cash we had. The quote from your paper where "robbers fled out the door, while the owner followed and reported to the Chinese police" is also not in accord with the facts. Four robbers stormed in and searched every drawer for over an hour and a half before fleeing when the police passed by. The police were aware of the robbers' suspicious flight and attempted to arrest them, but they were shot at. One of the robbers was shot dead. Please amend this statement.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Jie Meisheng. 28th November, 29th year.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>

On the same day last year, the highest was 44.6 degrees and the lowest was 29.1 degrees.</p>
<h3>The Meaningful "Young Edison"</h3>

<h3>My Mother is a Singer</h3>
<p>— Hua Ping</p>
<p>Before saying anything else, let me introduce myself.</p>
<p>I am someone who has lived for fourteen years without a father. My father abandoned my mother and me when I was four years old, leaving my mother with no property, only the daughter he loved.</p>
<p>My mother is a very ambitious and capable woman. She didn't want to see the cold stares of my uncles, and she didn't want to beg for help from relatives. Finally, she took me to Shanghai to start her struggle. She struggled with the environment everywhere, seeking survival in the struggle.</p>
<p>Imagine a helpless weak woman, with a four-year-old child, in an unfamiliar place with no relatives, how could she live? But I have lived for fourteen years and have been able to receive a high school education. I tell you, I tell you with tears, now I am the daughter of a singer, I have been the daughter of a singer for fourteen years.</p>
<p>But I don't think this is a disgrace, I don't think this is a shameful thing. For the sake of survival, for the sake of preserving the only relic my father left my mother, my mother did this. Late at night, my mother often cried and told me about her pain! She said she was sorry to my father! She said she was sorry to me, for making me bear the unclean shame of the family. We always cried facing each other, until I fell asleep. The next morning, I would find traces of tears beside my pillow, and sometimes I would wake up crying in my dream.</p>
<p>Now I am grown up, my mother's fourteen years of hard work have been rewarded. My mother's sacrifice has been worthwhile. Like my mother, my face and body are quite upright. Whenever guests praised me in front of my mother, or when people in the crowd cast a glance of envy, my mother gave a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>This year I am eighteen years old, and I have formed a mature girl in all aspects, but I lack a girl's heart. I have no youth, I have no friends, I have no lovers. How can I bring my friends to my "home"? How can I tell them that I am the daughter of a singer? Although I know this is not a disgrace, this is not an unspeakable scandal, how can the ruthless society understand? Whenever female classmates look at me jealously, and male classmates look at me greedily, my heart beats non-stop, as if they have discovered my secret. Letters of pursuit are often found in my desk, and I always tear them up mercilessly. Although I can't be called "as beautiful as peach blossoms", I am truly "as cold as frost", although my heart contains the youthful passion that all girls have.</p>
<p>Oh my god, I have been regarded as a perverted neurotic. Who knows that my heart is clearer than anyone else? I want to expose myself frankly, but how can I endure the public opinion of society? I love friends, I like groups, but I encounter the most lonely life!</p>
<p>I am eighteen years old, I am not a freak, but I have not enjoyed the rights that "people" should enjoy.</p>
<h3>"What a Coincidence!"</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>I am confident that my desire for knowledge is not weak. When I have nothing to do, reading is beneficial. However, there are still many things that I cannot see through or identify accurately. For example, why is the world situation so miserable and chaotic? I really have no way to find a simple and clear satisfactory answer. Once, an old friend, leaning on a cane, came to my humble abode. After chatting about the world, he suddenly sat upright, sighed deeply, and said: Human beings are extravagant and licentious, and should suffer a great catastrophe. Therefore, the heavens sent down demons to disturb all living beings. He also cited several well-known world heroes, pointing them out as constellations; he asserted that great chaos and great killing were the destiny of heaven. Of course, this is not the answer I expected.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I couldn't help but exclaim in surprise. I casually opened a recently published magazine and found a piece of flowery writing entitled "What a Coincidence!" written by Mr. M.L. Mayfux and translated by Mr. Fang Xiaomeng. After reading it, almost all the hair on my body stood on end. I felt that it was not heaven, not fate, that could be so coincidental! Now, let me copy it below:</p>
<p>Too coincidental! I think it would be too weak and irresponsible to simply dismiss it with the word "coincidence". If we were to "trace the cause", I really wouldn't understand. Are these four powerful and wealthy people truly created by heaven and endowed with heavenly destiny? My first thought was that if this were applied to China, there would be a basis in the heavenly stems and earthly branches, with the five elements generating and overcoming each other, and the science of astrology would have some truth to it. My second thought was that Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek's achievements were no less than theirs. So I looked up Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek's origins, and to my surprise, I found that:</p>
<p>It really stunned me! What else can I say, what else can I explain, except to attribute it to fate! But then came a third thought. For forty years, I have served in the press and have prided myself as an uncrowned king; perhaps the uncrowned king's natural pattern is no less than that of the aforementioned dignitaries. So, I secretly tried to arrange it myself, but I knew that it was better not to arrange it, because after arranging it, I laughed out loud and almost vomited blood and died. It turned out that my:</p>
<p>Dear readers! It is not my intention to deliberately curry favor. What I have arranged is the truth! Compared to the famous officials, it is exactly the same. Where can I allow myself to belittle myself? Looking in the mirror, I am truly proud, but reflecting on myself, I am ashamed. Thinking about it, I can't help but have wild ambitions. Looking forward and backward, I can't help but feel lost; I have been sleepless for several nights until today. My youngest son came back from school, and he actually saw that I was restless, so I happily boasted to him. Unexpectedly, he frowned and said that this was M.L. Mayfux's deliberate cunning, designed to attract people. Adding the birth year to the age will of course equal the same year. Adding the year of ascension to the number of years in power will also equal this year. Dividing the two this years by two will still be this year. Using this method, everyone is the same.</p>

<p>Hawthorne Case</p>
<h3>The Ballerina's Fate</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Report and Explanation</p>
<p>He said: "This old man is not only suffering, but he is probably going to die. But this is also the reward he deserves. He unfolded the two pieces of paper he was holding again. Mr. Jinshou, Songquan's report is completely correct. Those two guys are really fruitless. Li Zhifan has sent the money he got from exchanging the jade bracelet, diamond hairpin, and milk bead earrings to his son by express mail. Here is an express mail receipt and a money order receipt, amounting to 4,560 yuan." He handed the two unfolded papers to Ni Jinshou to look at.</p>
<p>I got these two pieces of paper from Li Zhifan's pocket at the corner of Qingpu Road and Datong Road. He told me about the two receipts at the time, but I didn't expect it to be like this. Ni Yushou waved to Songquan and told him to go out, then turned to speak to Hawthorne.</p>
<p>He said: "Mr. Hawthorne, can you tell me Li Zhifan's motive now?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne replied: "His motive is very simple. Money is the only theme, and there is also a partial associated effect, which I may as well make a temporary assumption. If I say something wrong, it would be good to have Li Shouqi correct it.</p>
<p>"I have told Bao Langer that Li Zhifan is a person with insufficient cultivation. He is used to a simple rural life. Once he stepped into the dazzling urban society, his heart was uncertain. He saw Wang Lilai squander and waste money like this, and his heart couldn't help but stir. He was Lilai's uncle-in-law, and she was also his unmarried daughter-in-law. The best thing would naturally be for Lilai to be willing to go back with them, but in fact, Lilai has also been completely changed by the environment, and their wishes are of course impossible to realize.</p>
<p>"This time, Shouqi came to Shanghai, clearly to resolve their marriage contract. I guess Shouqi's intention is still not to give up Lilai, hoping to complete this impossible marriage. Of course, Lilai would not agree, and may have promised to give him some money to dissolve this marriage contract. I certainly can't guess exactly what the father and son are thinking, but I expect that Lilai's suggestion may be approved by Li Zhifan, but Li Shouqi is wishful thinking, trying to get both money and people. But judging from Li Shouqi's shameless attempt on the seventeenth night the day before yesterday, it was finally resolved by his old man, which shows that Zhifan's feelings for Lilai have not yet been broken. Therefore, on the morning of the eighteenth yesterday, although Shouqi returned to Suzhou unhappy, Zhifan was still able to stay here. (181)</p>

<h3>Hollywood's "Seven Flowers"</h3>
<p>— Luo Cun</p>
<p>Peony Flower Bette Davis——Her figure and posture meet the conditions of "beauty of the times"; especially her pair of emotional eyes, which contain an unspeakable lure. On the screen, in addition to being able to play moving tragedies, she can also ride horses and shoot, drive cars, and ride motorcycles. Her attitude is very generous, and she speaks very easily, just like a peony flower in a garden.</p>
<p>Rose Flower Dorothy Lamour——She is born with full curves and an alluring charm. In "The Hurricane", she is dissolute, while in "Algiers", she is charming. Because she can be both dissolute and charming, she is like a "rose flower", although delicate and fragrant, but still be careful of its thorns, which will prick your hand.</p>
<p>Night-blooming Cereus Greta Garbo——She is a famous "mysterious woman". Her sharp and high nose is the biggest feature on her face. A pair of quick eyes and a contoured face are the representatives of her tragic master. In "Camille", she has an incredible "charm", which can indeed be compared to a night-blooming cereus, with green leaves and white flowers, full of mysterious melancholy.</p>
<p>Plum Flower Deanna Durbin——Her simple and elegant dress shows off her petite and exquisite appearance, and her beautiful face. She has a natural and beautiful singing voice, and she has won the elegant title of queen of song after "One Hundred Men and a Girl". The ability to achieve honorable harvests in "It's a Date" is all due to her ability to delicately depict the poignant and charming details. She can be compared to a poetic plum blossom.</p>
<p>Rose Bud Judy Garland——She is lively and cheerful on the silver screen, and she is indeed a "star of the times". She became even more popular after performing in "Meet Me in St. Louis". Her future is boundless! So I compare her to a rose bud that has not yet bloomed.</p>
<p>Begonia Flower Jeanette MacDonald——She has a natural loud and melodious singing voice and a light and agile posture. She has a large audience at MGM, and she has also won the praise of many audiences in her new work "Bittersweet". With her lightness and cheerfulness, she can be compared to a begonia flower.</p>
<p>Lotus Flower Merle Oberon——A plump and pleasing "oval face", coupled with two thin and long crescent eyebrows, a graceful figure, and a dashing and energetic attitude, she is as delicate as a lotus flower emerging from the water, so I compare her to a lotus flower.</p>
<h3>Famous Young Actor Yu Zhenfei to Participate in an Amateur Performance of "The Lion's Roar"</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Kunqu Opera, with its high art and small audience, is almost extinct except for the members of the Xiannixue Society. Mr. Yu Zhenfei comes from a prominent family in Wuzhong. His respected father, Mr. Suliu, was proficient in opera rhyme and was known as the "King of Opera". Mr. Yu inherited the family tradition from a young age. During his cradle years, he was familiar with the "Three Drunkennesses, One Success" and "Red Embroidered Shoes", which were no different from popular lullabies. At the age of seven, he learned posture from the old senior Shen Yuequan. At the age of fifteen, he made his first stage appearance at Lu Shunxiang's No. 1 Scholar's Residence in Suzhou, singing "Looking Home". Later, his father performed several times at the Yale Peake Theater in Shanghai to raise funds for the Kunqu Opera Training Institute. Since then, he has occasionally appeared on the red carpet. When Mr. Suliu passed away, Cheng Yanqiu was preparing to go to France to perform and lacked a young male actor. He strongly urged Yu to join him, and Yu agreed on the condition that Cheng would introduce him to Cheng Jixian as his teacher. He was exceptionally admitted and went to Beiping. The plan to go abroad was abandoned, so he stayed to study art. At the age of thirty, he practiced leg lifts, but his bones were already hard and he felt it was difficult to achieve success. Two years later, he switched to studying literary dramas and researching facial expressions, making rapid progress. Later, he returned to Shanghai and served as a professor of opera phonology at Jinan University for three years. At that time, Cheng Yanqiu made an appointment to go abroad again, so he went to Beiping again. Everything was ready, but the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and the trip to France became a distant dream. In the year, he came to Shanghai with Xin Yanqiu and collaborated on performances at Gengxin. This autumn, he was hired by Huang Jin. The contract expired on the 21st. He originally planned to return to Beiping to join the troupe, but Mr. Ni Gaofeng's mother's sixtieth birthday celebration was held by his friends at Jingtu Nunnery in Guling. Mr. Wang Chuansong invited all the members of Xiannixue to participate in the performance. Mr. Yu and Zhu Fuming and Zheng Chuanjian will co-star in the finale "The Lion's Roar". At that time, those who appreciate opera will surely be able to feast their eyes and ears.</p>
<h3>Portraits of Female Artists</h3>
<p>— Tang</p>
<p>(8) Zhou Lianxia</p>
<p>If we are to write biographies for female artists, then we should not omit Miss Zhou Lianxia. Miss Zhou is a famous female painter, female poet, and a master of the hairpin-style script. Her paintings are usually self-painted and self-inscribed, making her a triple threat in painting, poetry, and calligraphy. This truly makes Miss Zhou worthy of the title. Not only that, but Miss Zhou is also eloquent. In crowded gatherings, her arguments often flow freely, displaying her unconventional artistic demeanor. Once, I was at the residence of a certain master where I discussed the labor and inspiration of poetry with Miss Zhou. Miss Zhou expressed many valuable opinions on this issue; in terms of artistic achievement, she is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Miss Lianxia, courtesy name Ziyi, is originally from Ji'an, Jiangxi. Her respected father, Mr. Henian, served as the Prefect of Changsha during the late Qing Dynasty, so Miss Lianxia was actually born in Changsha. During his lifetime, Mr. Henian was very knowledgeable about epigraphy, calligraphy, and painting. Miss Lianxia received a family education from a young age, and was very intelligent since she was little. At the age of twelve, she began to write on fans for others and occasionally composed small poems, which were also quite remarkable. After moving to Shanghai, she studied painting with the old Huzhou calligraphy master Zheng Husu, and national studies with the Yixing scholar Jiang Meisheng. This finally gave her excellent talent the opportunity to be tempered, thereby reaching the realm of success. In her paintings, she is skilled in landscapes, figures, flowers, birds, insects and fish. Recently, the Chinese Women's Painting Association held its seventh exhibition. She participated in the exhibition with "Early Court of the Golden Palace", "Celestial Music in the Guanghan Palace", "Longevity Chart", and several flower screens. Every brushstroke was exquisite, especially the vibrant colors, which made the paintings appear particularly charming and brilliant. Among them, the "Longevity Chart" was appreciated by Yu Qiaqing, who ordered it for a price of one hundred and ten yuan. In addition, there were several lady fan surfaces, adorned with small regular script, shaped like fan bones, which were novel and pleasing to the eye, and were also all ordered. This exhibition lasted for five days, and as a result, Miss Lianxia's ordered works ranked first, accounting for more than one-seventh of the entire exhibition, which shows how much her artistic skills are valued.</p>
<p>Besides immersing herself in artistic endeavors, Miss Lianxia's only hobby is collecting photographs. Her boudoir contains more than a dozen albums filled with all kinds of photographs, many of which are valuable photos. Miss Lianxia regards it as a kind of artistic asset. In addition, she also loves to dance and watch movies, but when she is at home, she is proficient in cooking and sewing. She is truly a versatile and multi-talented modern woman.</p>
<h3>Ms. Zhou Paints Plum Blossom Figure Paintings</h3>
<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Futian Lianxuezheng</p>
<p>Opening Method, Seventy-Fourth Bureau</p>
<p>Black First</p>
<p>The seventh-rank cannon against the elephant pawn formation. The method of play is listed below: pawn 3 advances 1, horse 2 advances 3, chariot 1 moves to the center 2, chariot 2 retreats 1, cannon 8 moves to the center 3, cannon 5 advances 4, chariot 2 moves to the center 4, pawn 9 advances 1, cannon 8 moves to the center 7, horse 8 advances 9, horse 8 advances 9, pawn 3 moves to the center 2, chariot 2 advances 5, scholar 4 advances 5, horse 6 advances 5, elephant 1 retreats 3, cannon 2 moves to the center 5, chariot 1 moves to the center 2, elephant 3 advances 1, horse 9 advances 7, horse 9 retreats 8, minister 7 advances 5, elephant 7 advances 5, pawn 9 advances 1, cannon 2 moves to the center 5, chariot 9 moves to the center 8, pawn 7 advances - pawn 2 advances 1, horse 7 advances 6, horse 8 advances 7, pawn 3 advances 1, pawn 1 advances 1, horse 2 advances 3, chariot 2 advances 6, pawn 3 advances 1, cannon 7 advances 5, cannon 3 advances 1, cannon 5 retreats 2, chariot 4 advances 6, chariot 9 advances 5, horse 7 advances 5, cannon 5 advances 1. The explanation is that in this game, the black side advances pawns first, then cannons, so the red side also adds a central cannon to counter its attack. If the red side responds with a horse or elephant head, it is difficult to gain the upper hand. The red chariot advancing 6 is a preemptive move, preventing the black cannon from advancing 6 first, so pawn 7 advances 1, and chariot 2 retreats 1, and horse 9 advances 7, are all preemptive moves. The black chariot moving to the center 4, forcing the horse to exchange cannons, is also a stable move. At this point, the forces on both sides are balanced.</p>
