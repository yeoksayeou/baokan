<p>社評</p>
<h3>杜絕米市暗盤</h3>
<p>米市如中風在走，最近竟見洋米七十元，粳米八十元之高峰；較之戰前，漲五倍以上。調查全市所儲，米號與居家所存不計之外，即以棧存而言，猶擁有六十三萬五千包之鉅，爲量殊不謂少；况各地秋收不惡，新穀登塲，大小船舶之載米到埠者，相望於途；顧乃造此破天荒之高價，此而謂非奸儈居奇操縱，有小可得也。</p>
<p>當初欲使米價平準，勿爲暗盤所操縱，故以爲集中買賣，公開評價，管理市塲，則米價當有平穩之一日。孰意評價辦法，旣姑息因循，而集中管理，尤若具文。甚至米價已一落冉落，而評價仍高懸如故，及米價一漲再漲，評價又一放再放，雖有時怵於社會正論，不得不昌言維持原評價，然暗盤逾越八九元，任其吶喊成交，不加制止，則評價之爲明知故縱，有不容諱飾者矣。誠以與奸儈謀平準米價，原屬無異於與虎謀皮；誠使執法相繩，不稍寬假，則彼作奸犯科者寗不知違犯功令之將受懲處；徒以當局因循姑息，而同業之間，休戚所共，孰肯破除情面，孰願據實舉發秉公執行？有利共享，同惡相濟，遂成公開之秘密。所謂監督糾察之責，所謂懲戒之權，無不等於欺罔民衆之烟幕，於是奸儈無所忌憚而肆其罪惡矣。</p>
<p>此次評價最大之失策，實蹈粳米限價之覆轍。蓋當時粳米有限價，洋米無限價，及至洋米之價扶搖直上，粳米壁壘遂不攻而自破。此在米商必有一種含有恫嚇性之飾詞，以爲米價一律限制，勢必使採辦洋米者，望而却步，來源更形缺乏，恐慌愈必嚴重，故必綱開一面、寬嚴並濟，方無匱乏之虞；於是獨限粳米，不限洋米。詎知取締辦法不容有「例外」，一有「例外」，則弊端叢生。粳米限價之終於無形消滅，正爲限價辦法兩歧之故也。今評價又獨限於洋米，而不及於粳尖國米，因之粳尖暗盤，熟視無睹，旁若無人。顧不念工部局粳米限價之公告，至今似無明文撒銷也。乘瑕抵隙、舞文弄法，乃出入其間而以爲未嘗故意破壞當局之威信；更於自私自利，自評自行之評價，則儼然信守而屈伸之；乃相率明目張胆，爲塲外暗盤之買賣無所顧忌矣。夫何至於是哉？評價辦法在原則上非不善也，行之不得其道也。</p>
<p>竊以爲當局爲全市數百萬居民民食計，亦爲整個市面計，爲安全計，倘察隱忠，倘下決心，從事於取締暗盤，平準米價，調節民食，則應知非開幾次會議，發表幾篇談話所能濟事。要在有政策，有方案，任使幹才，予以實權，勗以作爲，責以事功，作有系統之組織，謀整個利益之調和。若乃枝枝節節而爲之，或一曝十寒，或循行故事，敷衍塞責，則惡果不遠，將非隱患而已！</p>
<h3>假道越南問題　談判在相持中　美稱日必遭遇困難　德對此亦未嘗贊同</h3>
<p>香港　渝大公報今日援引一外交界方面之消息、稱維希政府巳允日方要求、假道日軍通過越南、該報稱、法政府訓令越督德古將軍與日西原少將作詳細協商、日軍假道以不超過法軍之一半爲條件、然東京方面則要求通過日軍六萬名、並雇用本地勞工、及使用越南飛機塲等、但德古將軍拒絕日方要求、談判在繼續相持中、同時大公報稱、越南與渝政府仍極友好、苟日軍攻擊越南、則渠亦將歡迎華軍、（十三日國際社電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　今日河口傳來法日會議已無形停頓之消息、正與此間所料日軍經越侵華必遇鉅大阻力之觀念相符合、雖然、法日協定、或具形式、或係默契、其可能性外交界果未斷其必無也、至於日人企圖經越實行重大軍事行動、此間當亦無所驚異、唯衆信日人此舉實際上困難至多、蓋路多崎嶇、鐵道亦復有限、結果、必遭華人抵拒、國務卿赫爾曾有申言、美國對此、非常關注、不但外交立塲如此、亦因美國所獲鉅大原料、非產自越、卽經轉運故也、若中國之桐油鎢沙等等、在滇越路曁緬甸公路未經封鎖之前、卽由越南轉運之者、且查日人所遇外交阻力、非中法蘇聯諸國反對而已、德亦未嘗贊同、據非官方報告、德國高級官員所持意見、德之戰法、原非爲日、亦非爲其他非軸心國家、僅爲德義軸心之利益耳、此項消息、雖未證實、而已令人們興奮、認爲至少係援助法國援而拒絕日本若干要求、（十三日合衆社電）</p>
<p>東京　外務省發言人須磨、今日接見新聞訪員時、謂吾人已接到越南日員之來電、吾人相信日法當局之談判、已獲有若干進步、訪員力請切實聲明談判是否獲有良好進步而無停頓、或談判是否順利進行、發言人答稱、吾人頃悉該地日員現正竭力使談判獲有進步、談判之情形未能予以任何形容詞、訪員又問、據外報載稱越南總督德古將軍曾致羅斯福總統三電、請美國出助法日之談判、是吾確實、發言人答稱、渠未接官報徵實此說（十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>河內　據老開目擊者頃稱、越南邊界滇越路中國境內曾被華運炸毀之橋梁、恐日軍數月之久、方能將其修復、現時之火車旅客、於經過橋梁時、必須易車而舟、此間法當局似已從事之非常戒備、全部動員之舉、已經實行、着制衣之商人、每晨均舉行早操、主要政府機關均有武裝兵士守衛、又法國前次戰爭之退伍軍人、於今日下午曾舉行會議、商討時事、（十三日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>華官方否認　醖釀和平</h3>
<p>重慶　重慶負責方面今日極力否認海外所傳、謂重慶之主和派已漸獲得勢力、而不久或將造成中日之和平、此種消息咸屬「毫無根據、日懷惡意者、」某官員稱、「此間並無所謂主和派者、均蔣總裁決定一切、至言此種主和派中包括親德份子、更屬荒謬、」（十三日合衆社電）</p>

<h3>歐戰業談（五）　巴黎陷落之日</h3>
<p>巴黎繁華甲天下，紙醉金迷，素有「光明之都」＂City　of　Light”之稱，今年六月十四日陷落時竟變成一座死城。本文係美國合衆通訊社駐柏林分社長洛克納於傍晚，隨德軍開入巴黎親歷的紀錄，原文載七月八日美國「生活」圖畫週報，茲迻譯如下：</p>
<p>自從五月十日德軍在西錢開始總攻以來，我在比利時和法蘭西北部所經過的城市，成爲廢墟敗垣，人跡罕見者，爲數已不少。但所得印象的深刻，總不及在六月十四日那天，隨着德軍前鋒，一同開進法國首都巴黎那樣的永難磨滅。我雖然置身其地，似乎想不到這樣一個市面繁熒，車馬喧鬧的大都會，竟變成了一座死城。然而這城竟是死沉的了。又似乎不能相信巴黎已陷落於德軍之手，可是佔據這法國首都的，竟是德軍了</p>
<p>路上除了巴黎市警仍在街角站崗之外，這四百萬居民的大都市，連一個人也找不到。所住的市民，在德軍銳不可當的攻勢之下，早就逃避一空。百分之七十逃到附近城鎮，百分之三十閉戶不出。</p>
<p>凡是到過巴黎的人，總可以想像得出這是怎樣的一種景象：協和廣塲向來是車水馬龍，汽車嗚嗚，報販高聲叫喊，警察指揮車輛，行人喁喁談心－凡此種種，現已一無所見。祇偶然有德國軍官坐着的汽車，鳴着喇叭，衝破沉寂的空氣，向着最華麗的葛里龍旅館內，草草佈置的德軍司令部而去。那旅館的屋頂上，卐字旗隨風飄揚。一九一九年美國總統威爾遜曾在這旅館的陽台上受法國民衆的歡呼，星條交織的美國旗，也曾高懸在這屋頂之上。</p>
<p>協和廣塲上所見的一切凄凉景象，其他各處亦無往而不然。大道兩旁本來咖啡館林立，大家坐在那裏啜飲開胃的酒水，到處生氣蓬勃；現在呢，寂寞無人，大有幽靈出現之感了。我們在香藹禮大街，看見還有一家咖啡館開着。巴黎著名旅館區的幾家華貴大行台，沒有一家不鐵門緊閉。我們看到愛斐爾鐵塔，外交部，市政廳之上，卐字旗已替代了紅白藍三色旗，在那裏迎風展招。這中間最觸目的要算那凱旋門上的一面德國旗了。</p>
<p>最後，約在晚間十時左右，我們看見一位德國軍官穿過歌劇院大街而來，我們就問他有沒有一家可以給我們躭擱一宵的旅館。他回答說，「斯克里布旅館已經爲我軍徵用，你們也許可去碰碰運氣看。」我們一行多人，因爲要在戰壕中過生活，身上衣服不熨不褶，這時候旣疲又倦，大家風塵滿面，拖泥帶水的直向斯克里布旅館而去。那旅館中彬彬有禮的經理，看到我們這一羣不尷不尬的人，倒唁中先吃一驚。他搶着說道，「對不起得很，這裏一百六十個房間已被司令部徵用，給德軍高級軍官們居住了。」</p>
<p>我們這一羣裏面有九個是外國新聞記者，（其中三個爲美國籍）連同陸軍部，宣傳部，外交部方面的代表，一共三十人。領隊的位中一校官，軍聽得經理的話後，很堅決的道，「我命令你弄房問出來給我們這一隊人住。」</p>
<p>我們已餓得不開交，那旅館經理却堅說一些可吃的東西都沒有了。不過他說，「他知道有幾個德國軍官，曾在栗士旅館中吃過早夜飯，你們倒不妨到那邊去想想辦法。」我們這一班見不得人面的隨軍記者，就浩浩蕩蕩投奔那邊而去。栗士旅館的經理，本來已有點頭輕腳重，一見我們這一大堆人，幾乎就要昏厥過去。口中喃喃的道，廚房早已「打烊」，廚子和侍者都已回家去了。我們這位驃悍的中校倒是不受朦蔽的。對汽車夫一聲號令道：「車夫們，立正。」他們立刻排成一綫，靴踵與靴踵砰的一聲響。</p>
<p>「你們中間有誰懂得烹飪的」？車夫中一個面孔滾圓的胖子，立刻答應這：一長官，我能烹飪，悉聽調遣。」我們的領隊向他們說道：「你們大家都到廚房裏去幫忙。」</p>
<p>五分鐘之後，兩個穿長統靴子的車夫，履聲　　，領着我們走向地室而去。他們屏着氣息，搬運一箱香賓酒。當然也談不到什麼酒盞杯盤，就從箱子裏把整瓶的香賓拿出來授給我們。大家也都不以爲異。</p>
<p>忽然又來了四個穿着夜禮服，身上一塵不染的侍者。旅館經理怎樣去把他們找來的，我們也弄不懂。也許他以爲在這樣華麗的旅邸中，　丘八太爺們像在戰塲上粗手粗脚的捧盤傳餐，未免有些唐突這大客店罷。說也奇怪，頓時間，美味的火腿，輕軟的乳酷，火候恰到好處的煎蛋陸續呈上。這便是我們在巴黎第一夜所嘗　的珍饈盛讌。</p>
<p>在隨德軍開入巴黎的第一晚，我得到一個永難磨滅的印象。那時正將昏晻，我們在市中心緩緩的觀覽一週。第一個觸目的就是歷史上的凱旋門，和歐戰陣亡將士墓及「長明火。」這裏聚集着許多避難的人。凄慘之景，不忍卒覩；邁婆少婦，悲愴欲絕，幼童牽衣，泣不成聲。白髪盈顚的老頭兒，也是兩行清淚，直掛頰下。</p>
<p>隨行的軍官湊着我的耳朵說：「我們對於勇敢作戰的法國兵，並無間言。所不滿的就日那些誤國的政客。」還有幾個人對我表示道，當他們想像至法國兵站在柏林菩提樹大街歐戰陣亡將士墓前時，將作如何的悲慘景象，他們確實瞭解了。德國官兵行經凱旋門，都向陣亡將士墓行敬禮。開入巴黎的翌日，他們還備了一個紅白藍三種花所綴成的一個大花圈，飾以黑色的帶子，安放在墓前。</p>
<p>在這墓前，我另外還得到一個深刻的印象，在法國爲一種悲傷，在德國卻是一件高興的事。那是六月十六，星期日。勃利生將軍所率領的鐵軍，由香藹禮大街經過凱旋門而遊行至福煦路。法國人看起來這分明是恥辱：德國人呢，這卻是凡爾塞和約簽訂以來，每個國民的共同心願。希特勒選這一隊軍隊開入巴黎，原也有深意存乎其間。勃利生將軍的隊伍，會在波蘭柯特諾之役，立有光榮的戰績。勃利生將軍曾親口對我說。。「他們身經五十餘戰。個個都是銅皮鐵骨。他們上戰塲時目光炯炯，和在這裏遊行時的神情一式無二。」（本篇完）</p>

<h3>金融　英倫一再遭空襲　本市英匯鬆勢甚銳　合英美匯兌僅三元六角左右</h3>

<p>英金票供過於求</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况烚赤市價、穩中帶堅、英美余鎊因亦微漲五角、英金票仍屬供過於求、市價續降五角、蓋因滙兌做小、致買戶益感束手、美金票變動至微、終於下落三分、香港票供給頗旺，市價突告疲落、新加坡票忽降一角、日金票續降一分，晚市退至一元五角二分、朝鮮票仍鮮變動、晚市仍站一元一角一分原價、</p>
<h3>謠言消散　金市告平</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、浮動於六千一百五十元內外、謠言反響已見波平、惟多空角逐仍示劇烈、乃跌時如錢兌業等續有加碼、若以一般散戶心理而論、則疲象恐復重現、因外匯鬆平、買進者缺乏鼓勵至本日收盤結果能告升一十五元、經營者皆額手慶幸、晨初一度降達六千一百三十元、而最高到六千一百八十五元、午收爲狀穩定、後市走勢與上午相彷彿、收盤價爲六千一百七十元全日交易尚旺、約二千五百餘兩、銀樓飾金、終則未更、海關金等仍平</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲十五元</p>
<p>晨初市勢平疲、開市卽撳五元、證券帮出錢兌業五十兩、爲六千一百五十元、權因金號與銀號吐賣、且斯時除某錢兌業稍有扒吸、其餘進胃極淡、步挫二十元、銀號對做二十兩、退爲六千一百三十元、旋錢兌業吃胃漸濃、某銀號亦忽來在搜、加之金號帮反出爲進、二度曾盤升至六千一百八十五元、奈此後買風漸散、證券帮曁散多等先後求售、收盤前復跌至六千一百五十元、惟收盤幸錢兌業尚肯維持、遂告六千一百六十四元收市、午後開市抬起十一元、金號對做二十兩、爲六千一百七十五元、嗣因賣者稍多、卽跌十元、但錢兌業多頭加碼在扒、曾抬至六千一百八十五元、奈金號證券帮等逢高賣出、一時散戶跟塞、走勢轉軟、一度小至六千一百四十五元、入後買戶乘低再撈、同時售者驟减、結果遂告六千一百七十元收盤、比上日載漲十五元、全天五十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十餘元、收進减低三十元，現標金照掛牌金一低五十數元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>首飾金兌價不動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、終日未動、大同行仍懸六百三十元、新同行與上價相仿、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米仍昂　新米到貨頗旺</h3>
<p>洋米市面仍在暗盤中度其黑市生活、且被投機幫借爲買賣籌碼、市面早已不從正軌上落，乃隨人心與謠言所左右矣、早市國米到源見湧、且有皖新秈由長江續到千包、而實銷亦以「讓節」見减、且無國內外時局變化足以操縱者藉口、市價乃隨浮多獲利出籠下頓瀉元外、然價平後又爲新囤垂靑、而大戶行囤擯持如故、實銷方面亦略爲添辦、市又拾級回好七八角至近元市上正式交易仍祇紅尖碾尖洋元米等不受限制之貨、其他如西貢暹邏各米盡如杜粳之一律暗盤、全日交易仍有五六千包、聞一號陳西貢仍爲六十九元、火絞六十八元、二號西貢六十五元、二號暹邏及小絞六十三元半、六十三元、東京砶尖六十元、五十九元、米茶高五十六元、次五十四元、</p>
<p>粳　國米、昨到六七百包、明暗交易、因初傳說洋米回疲、相隨轉懈、售主堅持、遂亦站住、無甚榮辱、悉與前盤相埒、</p>
<p>新粳尖來源頗旺、不過粳貨佔有大半、尖僅有限、計到周浦新粳五十餘石、太倉嘉定新羊尖二十八担、及初到角里新杜尖六担、致際銷塲遜色之間、身骨旣軟不易守持其新粳遂難立足、行情獨貶元半光景、開七十三元七十二元半、新羊尖則以到銷兩平、太倉及嘉定原包貨均仍爲六十六元半、六十六元、斛見六十四五元、而角里新杜尖、一以新到時鮮、二僅區區六担、是以開價較羊尖爲秀、達六十七元半、六十七元、</p>
<h3>囤風未戢　日粉重振</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日現粉市况、頗有堅持狀態、華粉廠盤仍爲十五元五角、兩廠批出數量不多、目下內地粉存到兩缺、本街對於廠粉需要不弱、常有供不敷求之勢、鳳凰牌現粉因傳某方不許運入租界之消息、人心望好、擯持乏開、惟投機界側重之鳳凰牌期粉，則尤興高彩烈、囤買未衰、十月份開盤尚平、價祇十五元六角半、旋以米價堅穩、囤戶吸收、步升至十五元八角、比上日大一角三分、九月份由十五元三角半、升至二角八分、比上日亦大八分、全日成交九月份僅有四千包、十月份共有二萬包、現廠粉本街零批交易的有六千餘包，洋粉及內地粉交易俱靜、惟傳北洋帮添辦下脚粉數千包、價爲十五元八角、又麵粉今日有一千五百包、運往威海衛、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日市况依然呆頓之局、內地來貨因搬運誰停發、運輸受阻、華廠以自定洋麥將到、進胃並不過佳、日廠則專以擇巧而辦、聞送廠貨日有二三千包、均係三鑫廠收辦、價仍爲二十一元左右、華廠收價須加三元以上、收貨僅二三百包、</p>
<h3>證卷　消息迷離　債市兎起鶻落</h3>
<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市况趨勢兎起鶻落、突漲乃受新借款成功之謠、驟跌則因消息爲一部份人不置信、致多頭仍有出籠、所謂事出有因、查無實據、但此項消息、聞之金融界之意見、則謂事則誠出有因、實據則似未成熟、大約尚在醞釀、故公債不受鉅大刺激、市塲大部份仍係看好、忽漲忽跌、仍係一部份浮多了結、故市價並未見小、丁種因客戶特種關係、志在必售、故祇得抑價求售、此與公債整個趨勢無關出入、借款一旦證實、則漲風必比前爲尤鉅、此層殊不可忽視也、昨日經過、上午漲風甚勁、丙種曾至六元三角、比隔日猛漲一元、此則一般人信任借款之說關係、後以金子行市安靜如常、並無劇跌之反證、乃使多方引起懷疑、浮多隨市出籠而回跌、午後行市乃趨於盤旋、人心見仁見智、各有不同、午後瀉出仍多、丁種市價祇做三元、五萬交易、立卽銷去、可見市塲胃量、及銷化力尚甚堅强、前途雖看盤旋、但仍係看漲者居多、市價結果、除丙戊種未有高低外、甲乙種仍漲二三角、丁種猛跌七角、當屬例外、成交總數共計約一百二三十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中興煤礦公司股五十股、價爲一百十三元、</p>
<p>又衆業公所報告、股市趨勢、甚現杌隍、賣風隨時擴展、幸大部份被補空者吸收、當價格過分低落時、尚有乘機收賤之投資家活動其間、雖週末假期甚長、成交額極其龐大、可見市衆信心並不缺乏，設消息而不惡化、此種信仰將更充分表露、　橡皮股慘跌較厲、實業股則少變更、</p>
<h3>紗花　遠期紗有拋空</h3>
<p>紗市仍在盤旋之境、此因　銷不暢、而外匯亦甯靜、因此多頭雖屬看升、然環境所不許、照此而論、市面當有下跌之象、但一般經濟充足之戶、拉緊仍不放棄、一時籌碼關閉不鬆、惟遠期有一部份傾向拋空、因存貨日增、而銷路愈狹、所以逢高時賣出頗不乏人也、現紗晨開、人氣尚各善、因消息稍好、二十支、　馬價爲九百七十三元、卽刻跌至九白六十五元、後一般搶帽子之戶、父復活動、紛紛拖進、塲上買氣彌漫、然究其實際買者、並未十分踴躍、多係投井下石之作風也、漲至九百七十九元、但收盤以後又見緊昂、查半日成交統計二千九百四十三包、行情二十支雙馬跌四元、今日有棉紗二百六十件運暹邏、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>
<h3>江浙新棉良好　其如無法運出</h3>
<p>現棉情形、殊覺呆滯、本棉江浙兩省新棉作較爲良好、然領用搬運證手續極艱、無法運出、棉商祇得坐視、昔日購訂之外棉尚充足、然廠方以紗市前途、希望殊少、不願採辦原料、所以亦造成不尷不尬之局面也、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市平靜、後因現貨需要良好、及一部份之空頭抵補結果收盤價格、較之上日漲一二磅音、印度市况平平、連同預測漲半羅比、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊爲靜寂、各方俱以政治消息變幻莫測、故咸抱觀望態度、然市上存底不豐、棉價不致再跌、蓋因同業間以購買新花、洋行方面需先付而後裝、風險殊巨、訂購者寥寥、故現有之存貨、擬待他日善價而沽也、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖微跌</h3>
<p>昨日糖市趨轉軟、公會劃盤、二四粗白本棧貨七十八元、外棧新貨七十八元六角、小二角、六月份到七十八元、四月份老貨包皮略油者七十六元、轉口貨六十二元八角、荷棉白KD嘜七十四元、　嘜六十三元、　嘜均爲六十二元、太古B嘜　十六元八角、後爲七十六元五角、比上日小四角DY嘜七十三元五角、不動、HX七十三元五角、路貨爲七十三元二角五分、</p>
<h3>海味　暹邏淡萊新到一批</h3>
<p>暹邏淡萊，以到貨寥落、致市間漸感缺乏、查大隻貨且斷檔已久、方於前日新到一批、業已售開、成價二百零五元、中淡仍爲一百九十元、勢殊堅走、</p>
<h3>南北貨　新桃肉豐收　前後猛跌四十元</h3>
<p>新桃肉近日陸續有到、而本屆收成較豐、故開價步降、查前價曾降至二百零三五元、昨又猛跌二十餘元、以一百八十元成盤、前後降度已達四十元云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　白煤屑銷路暢</h3>
<p>鴻基白煤屑、最近新貨雖絡續湧到、但本街門莊店及煤球廠紛紛在辦、四出搜羅、市貨大有隨到隨銷之勢、鴻基一號屑、市塲暗盤已喊一百十八元，仍有吸胃，碼頭過駁、照盤便宜三元、水脚排車、顧客自理、</p>
<h3>藥材　茴香產價　超出滬市三四十元</h3>
<p>茴香近以香港匯水上展成本增高、照邇夾函訊、報價須超出申市三四十元之多，因此極難合劃、致乏到貨、號盤喊一二十元、尚未成交云、</p>
<h3>雜糧　蠶豆漲風突起　受米糧昂貴影響　致引起囤戶胃口</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市因來源稍接、辦胃不前、故市轉疲軟、惟蠶豆反突起漲風、此種騰達趨勢、完全受米糧在暴影響、引起囤戶胃口、以致到存兩少之落令貨、轉呈欣欣向榮之局、昨吳江揀蠶開二十四元、成交一車、通貨二車、價爲二十一元八角至二十二元、北港毛家市靑蠶一百四十餘包，價爲一十一元、南港閔行靑蠶一百餘包、價爲十九元七角半、嘉定白蠶三四百包、價爲二十一元四角、崇明沙蠶三百餘包、價爲十八元五角至十九元、蕪湖小粒白蠶五百包、價爲十七元七角至十八元云、</p>
<p>生油今日有四白聽、運往小呂宋、另有苞米五百包、運往威海衛、</p>
<h3>五金　馬口鐵續漲</h3>
<p>馬口鐵因蛋廠帮採辦不力、近有北路客商搜羅、本街廠家亦有少量納胃、該貨本埠存底不豐、且海外來源不充、（因外國定價較之滬市行情反覺高昂）、故執貨者心思挺秀標準行盤繼續增高、查昨市喊價如一百八上磅意貨每箱（內一百十二張裝）沽二百十元、美貨售二百四十元、二百磅意貨喊二百四十元、二百磅正號美貨每箱則須二百八十元耳、</p>

<h3>維護司法尊嚴　作坦百純潔聲明　合法官員執固定法律　公正審判於政治無偏頗　第一特院法官昨與西報記者談話</h3>
<p>第一特區法院　事官員與譯員接恐嚇函事、特一法院某負責官員昨晨（十三日）向英文大美晚報記者闡明立塲稱、吾人蒙一九二七年法院協定各簽字國所承認之合法中政府委爲特法院官員、責當執行者、爲中國刑法之固定法律而非共他法律、</p>
<p>處理案件　力求公正</p>
<p>對於一切嫌疑犯與罪犯、儘可能不示褊坦、吾人決不　更變中政府制定之法律、亦不擬出此、關於恐嚇函件、無可言者、蓋吾人本身卽合法政府所制定法律之執行　　、</p>
<p>新頒法律　概不生效</p>
<p>任何國家之政府、皆有變動可能、如中國政府有所變動、其於刑法之合法執行吏、亦無差異、然新政府未經承認爲代表人民之合法機關、則截然不同、其所頒佈之新法律、概不生效、而合法委任之執行吏、亦決不執行此新法律、</p>
<p>賡縵奉行　國府法律</p>
<p>吾人蒙重慶中政府委爲法院官員、以維上海特區中之法律與秩序、職當遵行衆所水認的合法中政府制定之法律、此　決賡續執行者、唯此一種法律、他方所定法律、概不置問、</p>
<p>恫嚇威脅　非所顧慮</p>
<p>苟任何委任官員對此意見小合、乃其個人觀點使然、然合法政府決不認許之、故對具此覜點者、立予撒職、各推事之責任、乃在執行合法政府所制定中國刑法中之法律、往時與目今吾人所接恫嚇、以全置不顧爲善、</p>
<p>在政治上　無所偏頗</p>
<p>蓋吾人依法審判、在政治上無所褊頗、而對審判罪犯、公正不阿、乃責之所在也、各推事旣抱此信念、自當賡續進行吾人相信係公允之工作云、聞法院推事每晨赴院、皆由工部局警務處派專車接送、且有持手提機關槍·與手槍之警員隨車嚴密防衛、</p>
<p>日司法員　參觀法院</p>
<p>昨日下、有日本人八九名、分乘汽車三輛、抵威海衛路八七〇號江蘇七海第一特區地方法院門口相繼停車、同時工部局法律組律師厲志山、亦乘汽車趕至、旋下車領該批日人步入法院、門警及捕房探捕、見該批日人係由厲律師領導、故未加阻止、該批日人、由厲律師領導參觀第一第二第三各民庭一過、卽分乘汽車而去、該批日人、係日本檢察官等司法人員、事前得工部局同意、故厲律師陪往參觀、當日本司法人員參觀特、法院時該管靜安寺捕房聞訊、立派高級警員到法院詢問眞相後、亦駕車而去、</p>
<h3>三浦調墨使　定期離滬</h3>
<p>日本駐滬總領事、自改委日外務省東亞事務局長崛内干城接充後、現任總領三浦義秋、亦業經外務省十二日公佈、調充駐墨西哥公使、三浦奉令後、已定於本月二十六日搭輪離滬赴日、稍行勾留後、卽往墨接任、連日正忙於辦理移交事務、</p>
<p>傅崛田改　任大使說</p>
<p>又訊、日本新近派駐上海經領事崛田干城、爲一有名之中國通、係上海同文書院畢業後、回國改進大學、研究法律、原任日本外務省東亞課課長自近衛重作馮婦、大事更動外交人員後、始行派駐上海總領事兼大使館參事官、近聞日本外務省對於人事、又作第三次更動、將崛田干域特命爲全權公使、由此足見日本之外交政策、大有舉棋不定之概况、</p>
<h3>戈斯默　尚無離滬準備</h3>
<p>法大使戈斯默、迭有傳其卽將離滬赴渝之說、茲據平明社記者探悉、法大使戈斯默、目前尚未作離滬之準備、惟法總領事奧琪、則決於法大使未離滬前先行離滬、</p>
<h3>外輪　駛防船期</h3>
<p>駐華英軍撤退時、徵用怡和洋行怡生·永生·德生·浩生·等四輪、業已抵新加坡公畢、次第回返香港復航、各情已誌報、茲永生輪今日已可到滬、定十九日自滬駛港防、怡生輪十六日可到、航期尚未宣布、泰生輪亦於十六日自津烟回滬、準十八日由滬駛防、兼灣香港、德生輪聞由新加坡直駛西貢、運米至滬、然後來滬、浩生輪尚在返滬途中、消息甚鮮、</p>
<p>米運暢通</p>
<p>太古輪船公司之甯海輪、昨在法租界外灘碼頭裝貨完畢、定今晨啟椗駛往暹邏轉小呂譜、嘉應輪則定二十二日駛往、該公司之新疆輪、定十九日開往西貢等處、法國航務公司之西江號、於下月中返滬、而駛往西貢暹暹之輪隻、均將裝儎大量米糧來滬、駛往海防之輪隻、亦附載洋米來滬、故本埠洋米來源、當無問題、</p>
<h3>抑平米價未成功　評價會引咎　該會應否存在成問題　請租界當局指示辦法　評價委會兩人已函辭</h3>
<p>本市米業各團體、前秉承兩租界當局意旨、適應事實需要、組織米糧評價委員會、根據洋米產價、加入米商應得圳潤、每星期二五兩日、評定洋米最高價格、杜絕市塲操縱投機、該會成立迄今、已二月餘、近因越南局勢緊張、投機份子、因此操縱市價、該會雖循例按期開會、討論抑平米價辦法、無如困難重重終鮮實效、而市塲暗盤盛行、限價等於具文、昨日該會召開第八次常會、各委員及兩租界市商會代表均與議、經長時間之討論後、對於取締暗盤、抑平米價各點、仍難獲得具體有效辦法、處此惡劣環境之下、僉認唯有函請租界當局指示辦法、</p>
<p>決議情形</p>
<p>其決議有云、本委員會顧念平民生計、堅決維持本月三日之評定價格、然連日暗盤盛行、評價等於具文、本委員會心餘力絀、再四籌維、殊無妥善之策、在此情形之下、本委員會應吾繼續存在、實已成爲問題、惟有將辦理困難情形、及各洋行所報產價、函請兩租界當局請示辦法、俾資遵循、」又聞下次會議、在未得當局指示以前、該會不再舉行、是則當局責任益見重大、恐有强制執行米價、公開出棧之一日矣、聞昨日會議時、主席朱子香建議於大會兩點、（一）函請兩租界當局轉商虞洽卿君、將渠已訂購運滬作寗屬平糶之洋米十萬包、暫時供應市塲、以便安定人心、加多市塲現貨、（二）再度致函豆米雜糧兩業公會、際茲民食恐慌之時、卽日召集同業會員、力勸繼續認購洋米、滿裕民食、而厚存底、</p>
<p>磋商集購</p>
<p>上海米糧評價委員會曾於本月七日召開評價委員第六次會議、僉以欲抑低米價、首須增厚米糧存底、及取締市塲暗盤、經議決結果、分函兩租界當局曁上海市商會、尅日邀集各業代表、勸導認購洋米、該項函件、卽於次日由該會專差送達、茲巳於昨日接得各該當局函復、對於集體訂購洋米一節、頗表贊同、決將邀集各業代表磋商具體辦法、促其實現、並表示對於取締市塲暗盤、於力所能及、亦將嚴厲施行職權、及元協助穩定整僩米市、又據探悉、米號業對於集體購米、甫在積極進行、並張念萱瞿振華兩氏、巳函辭評價會委員、</p>
<h3>滬西警權協定　月底可望成立　工部局覆文件日內可發出</h3>
<p>某高級官員昨晨（十三日）對西報記者稱、工部局與傅筱庵關於越界築路區「聯合警權」問題、最後之協定卽將成立、工部局致傅筱庵之覆文、不久卽可發出、一般預料、該問題可望於本月月底以前完全解決、</p>
<p>又據另一消息、工部局警務處總巡包文少校、昨會對西報記者稱、外傳越界築路區一聯合警權」問題、將於本月月底以前解決一節、雖有此種可能性、但恐不致有此事實、包氏謂關於該問題之一切工作、恐非六星期之內所能完成、遑論一星期矣、但渠稱最後協定、或可望於十一月初成立、聞工部局致傳筱庵之覆文、可望於下星期內發出、</p>
<h3>美旗艦奧古斯泰號　日內駛滬</h3>
<p>呂未號離滬西上</p>
<p>美揚子江司令艦呂宋號、突於十二日由滬解繼駛出吳淞口、昨晨已返滬、衆信駛赴長江流域之蕪湖、泊滬美艦、均已離去、惟亞洲艦隊掃雷艦鷺驚號則已於昨晨由靑島駛來上海、赫德上將之旗艦奧古斯泰號聞亦將於下週一前由華北來滬、</p>
<h3>獎勵游資內移　國府保息</h3>
<p>財政部爲獎勵上海游資內流、令銀錢業吸收上海存款、予以優厚之利息、而移其資金於內地、其所得利息、特准在上海支取、並組織銀團集合資本、直接投資於內地有利產業、如有虧蝕或派利不足官利、則由政府予以補償、各情已見前報、目前上海游資之所以不願內流者、實由於投機利潤特厚、今觀上海投機市塲之變化、則證實「投機安全」之不可靠、投機者巳明瞭掀風作浪之危險、况今世界局勢變化不測、各國均有捲入戰爭　渦之可能、投機之風、此後勢必漸戢、擁資者已以利息之高低、爲安放資金之唯一　標準、</p>
<h3>主要地產　輸出激增　年達六萬萬元　西北貨運暢遂</h3>
<p>國府當局自抗戰軍興、對各種主要土產、竭力獎勵輸出、以換取外匯、充實抗戰經費、茲據經濟部發表統計、主要國產經政府統制銷售於海外者、如絲·茶·桐油·猪鬃·鎬·銻·及錫、巳每年達六萬萬元、近雖越南貨運受阻、但西北國際路綫輸出、仍極暢遂、可見當局獎勵土產輸出政策、巳克收宏效、今後當有繼續進展、另據中國海關報告、本年最初六個月整個輸出之價值、較上年同一時期增加達一倍有餘、卽去年同時期之輸出額爲四一一·六一〇二六二元、而本年最初六個月已增至九三四·五八五·一五一元、亦足證明各項主要土產輸出之愈見增加、</p>
<h3>倡導節省秋節筵資　捐助平糶</h3>
<p>本市滙中銀號經理黃雨齋氏近鑒於哀鴻遍野、嗷嗷待哺、滬市升斗小民、不假自給、雖早有平糶會及民食調劑會之成立、然來日方長、米荒未已、平糶經費、愈多愈善、乃將滙中總分支行本屆秋節筵資、節省百元、捐助平糶、並兩請處洽老領導提倡、則登高一呼、衆山饗應、上略、當此天災人禍紛至沓來之際、哀吾黎庶、面皆菜色、轉瞬</p>
<p>秋盡冬來</p>
<p>朔風凜烈、繪纊無溫、本市百萬平民、行將啼飢號寒、呼救無門、吾人託天之庇、得免凍餒之憂、宜應如何自加惕勵、節衣縮食、以求心之所安、試問均是圓顱方趾、同種同文、富則珍饈滿席、不屑下箸、輕裘暖帽、尚嫌不溫、貧則饑腸轆轆、捧腹摳心、鶉衣百結、哀哭街頭、天道不公、何苦樂之若是懸殊耶、今者、節屆中秋、</p>
<p>團圞賞月</p>
<p>習俗相沿、牢不可破、公館商店恣意太嚼、一席之資、動輒百金、一餅之費、數十不等、所謂「富家一席酒、窮人半年糧、」試問當斯在歡之夜、酒酣耳熱之際、或亦思及道左之嶙嶙白骨、與夫面目黎黑、形容枯槁之同胞乎、其稍有人心者、勢必停盃痛哭、掩面流涕、尚有何賞心樂事之可言、雨齋謬列平糶會委員、自應</p>
<p>以身作則</p>
<p>故將滙中秋節筵資、節省百元、指助平糶經費、明知汲深綆短、力拙心長、區區之數、未免爲富者齒冷、但願人人作如是想家家作如是觀、則本市富豪之家、殷實之店、何止數萬、如均能以此爲出發點、則集腋成裘、成績定有可觀、如是亦不負雨齋倡導苦心矣、</p>
<h3>羅斯福碼頭　開始疏濬工程</h3>
<p>法租界外灘維斯福碼頭、因年久失修、污泥澱積、船舶停靠、殊多妨碍、衛利韓公司特承租小型挖泥船一艘、在該碼頭進行疏濬工作、業於昨日開始、的一個月內可完成、該挖泥船每日可挖污泥一百方、聞在疏濬期內、並不妨碍輪只之停靠、</p>
<h3>法租界糞車夫工潮　解決條件五項</h3>
<p>相持多日之法租界糞車夫工潮、勞資雙方談判圓滿結果後、全體工人七百餘、於前晨三時起一律復工、所有里弄內之積糞於焉肅淸、記者昨向馬浪路馬鴻記訪悉、雙方同意之條件如下、（一）全體工人每月一律加薪四元半、（二）資方每年須供給各糞夫雨笠一頂、（三）各糞夫發生疾病、赴法租界衛生局請醫者、得免納掛號費、以輕負擔、（四）糞夫若有將糞私自出售情事、立卽開除、（五）此項條件係暫時性質、不得永遠有效、至勞方請求資方每年發給工會津貼費四百元一節、不能成立、</p>
<h3>家庭麵包價　每磅漲三分</h3>
<p>兩租界當局前爲改善民食問題起見、經與各麵包公司商定烘製「家庭麵包」一種、每磅規定零售三角八分、銷售以來、巳歷數月、近來各該麵包公司認爲滙價趨落、各項物料成本加重、爰經呈請提高上項麵包之售價至每磅四角一分、業經兩租界當局姑予照准、惟一俟市况好轉、卽當重行規定、</p>
<h3>防區問題　非由上海解決　將由美日政府會商決定　滬美當局前晨確會會商</h3>
<p>昨晨（十三日）本埠美國官方雖否認舉行會議一節、但據悉美海軍長江艦隊司令葛拉斯福·美代理總領事布德立·及美海軍第四聯隊司令貝克上校等、確於前日（十二日）上午十時、在美總領事署舉行會議達一小時半之久、按上次美海軍亞洲艦隊司令赫德上將蒞滬時、曾數度舉行會議、歷次會議之詳情、雖至今尚未發表、但一般相信、談話之內容、大半關於本埠英軍撇退後所引起之防區問題、此間官方仍認爲以前英軍所管理之防區、其支配問題之最後解決、正在美日兩國當局研究之中、最後之決定、將由該兩國政府作成之、而非由此間當地解決、</p>

<h3>華北來客述　外僑備遭困厄　實際上已禁止外貨入　華北民衆精神堅苦卓絕</h3>
<p>近從華北抵滬之某君頃告西報記者稱、北平外僑雖遭華北日人橫施重重限制與滋擾、且明瞭日人正力迫他國僑民停業、以便壟斷該地一切商業、然外僑今仍竭力維持其貿易、</p>
<p>限制外商　愈益嚴密</p>
<p>北平故都、自受日人控制後、商業一落千丈、外國商業所受限制、變本加厲、致營業瀕於停頓、例如日方近對外國貿易施加一種限制、不准外商商號從東三省輸入五十元以上之貨物、其輸出亦以二百元爲限、</p>
<p>實際禁止　外貨輸入</p>
<p>尤有進者、最近所頒貨幣條例、已在實際上禁止外貨輸入、北平之主要商業卽骨董業、亦已衰落、他如海外製造之汽車、近已停止入口、唯外商烟草公司尚未受嚴軍影響、美英紙烟仍有出售、邇來行抵北平之德人、爲數頗多、惟彼等與義僑之貿易、亦受限制之阻撓、大批德人之抵平、頗使人以彼等何故前往爲問、然無人能解答之、</p>
<p>北平已衆　刻苦自勵</p>
<p>北平民衆忍受種種困難、頗能刻苦自勵、縱糧荒時、亦能忍怨耐苦、彼等對日方宣傳、似充耳不聞、然對歐洲與中國局勢、因而所知不多、平市全體居民、皆受日憲兵監視、恒有被召往司令部、嚴密盤詰其活動、及與其他華人之關係者、華人除聆取純屬日方宣傳之廣播外、不准聽取共他播音、</p>
<p>華游擊隊　充分活躍</p>
<p>北平全區、游擊隊活躍無已時、若干人士感覺以該區游擊隊實力勁强、八路軍苟欲奪取北平、殊非難事、日方所傳游擊隊乃無紀律之「匪黨」、實係讕言、蓋游擊隊組織完善、迭使日軍與交通受慘重損失也、</p>
<p>火車殘骸　棄鐵路旁</p>
<p>北平四週僅書間始有日軍放哨、入夜卽無日哨兵影蹤、因恐夜間被游擊隊捕去也、平津鐵路各車站四週、巳造壘堡、以防華軍進攻、火車被毀者殊夥、其殘骸棄置鐵路旁、屢見不鮮、</p>
<p>排外運動　必告失敗</p>
<p>日人希圖鼓動華人進行排外運動、然民衆對此、皆乏興趣、所謂「東亞集團」者、在華北必告失敗、抑華北日軍深溝高壘、保護頗善、乃不能否認者、非游擊隊獨力能逐之出境、</p>
<h3>象山永嘉甯波　先後被炸</h3>
<p>本埠浙省旅滬　體、昨接浙東電告如下、十一日中午十二時二十五分、觀海衛上空發現日機二架、寗波防空哨當發空襲連緊念警報、旋該日機過龍山、由鎭海穿山侵入象山上空、投彈一枚彈落城廂內、毀房屋十間、重傷平民二人、及輕傷四人、該機肆虐後、卽經石浦竄入海門上空盤旋後、嗣又飛往永嘉、投彈十枚、內難燃燒彈二枚、城內當卽起大燃燒、在永嘉投彈後、復竄人瑞安投彈三枚、後經向黃岩寗海奉化過鎭海龍山出海逸去、至一時四十六分解除警報、下午四時〇三分寗波又發警報、海門發現日機二架四時十五分、該日機有襲甬模樣、故卽繼發緊急警報、旋日機果卽侵入寗波市空盤旋二匝、投下一百磅及二百磅炸彈各一、彈落永南鄕第六保磨×莊畋中、幸無死傷損失、投彈後、卽向龍山逸去、四時四十分解除警報、又十二日晨六時十分、石浦洋面日艦一艘、突向沿岸開砲四發、彈落泥塗、幸無損失、</p>
<h3>上海英僑救濟　倫敦災民</h3>
<p>撥款二千五百鎊　連同慕款悉滙英</p>

<h3>水蛆賺人</h3>
<p>安慶西門外大興橋一帶，有一種無業游民，生小練就能入水三四時，不至淹斃，於是凡遇客販船到岸，或見是布匹及一切值錢貨物，便邀約數人，上船購買，携貨在手，故意擁擠看估，俄而跌落水中，人貨兩沒。其同黨反恫喝客販，以爲人命關天，須通知屍親，報縣打撈，客販畏事，儘有私自出錢了結，揚帆遠遁。其實入水者早於半里外之僻靜處登岸，所得貨物及訛詐銀錢，合夥瓜分。此風向不多見，近則居然視作買賣，層見疊出。本地人稱若輩爲水蛆，側目以視，則其見惡於人也，可想而知矣。</p>

<h3>耶穌基督的饒恕精神（三）</h3>
<p>（三）人皆需要上帝的饒恕：我們人人都有罪孽，都有重釘耶穌于十字架的可能，（希伯來書六6）都需要如此的饒恕。我們旣需要上帝的饒恕，所以我們也當領恕人。因爲耶穌曾經說過：『你們僥恕人的過犯，你們的天父也必饒恕你們的過犯。你們不饒恕人的過犯，你們的天父也必不饒恕你們的過犯」。（馬太六14/15）</p>
<p>我們各人都有幾個對於我們不存好心的人，有時免不了要吃他們的虧，假使不學耶穌的榜樣饒恕他們，我們也得不着天父的饒恕，但願我們都能效法耶穌的饒恕，與仇敵復和。有開罪於人的地方，請人原諒，人有不愜我意之處，學耶穌的榜樣饒恕他。人人都有一時的糊塗，不能了解對方的心事，惟共不能了解，於是誤會便發生了，世人一切的誤會，皆造因於」不曉得」。因爲有了誤會，於是「心中存芥蒂，眼底失公平」，常要尋找報復的機會，互相怨恨，失掉和陸。</p>
<p>「父阿！赦免他們，因爲他們所做的，他們不曉得」。耶穌這句禱告，眞是給我們一個極好的榜樣，他不是「只能坐而言，不能起而行」，他乃是『言顧行，行顧言』，怎樣敎訓別人，也怎樣躬行實踐，眞可說是完人之範，所以我們應當接受他『你們當效法我」的呼聲，正人先正己，隨時隨事原諒人，一面在天父面前，求天父饒恕自己的罪孽，一面效法耶穌爲仇敵禱告的饒恕精神，饒恕得罪我們的人。「施諸已而不願，亦勿施諸人」。這是我國偶像所講的恕道，但耶穌的敎訓，比這還要積極，乃是「你們願意人怎樣待你們，你們也要怎樣待人」·你旣知道自己不能事事盡如人意，希望人的原諒，你就應當先原諒人。</p>

<p>十九年前，美國河海河省有一個名叫尤琴的四歲孩子，在地窖的扶梯上跌了一交，腦部受震，暈厥了幾分鐘。兩年之後的某一天，他突然發極厲害的羊癲瘋來，以後三日一小發，五日一大發，甚至一日數發，或一發數日，他就這樣的在差不多毫無間歇的昏迷無知狀態中虎度了十七年寶貴的光陰。</p>
<p>羊癲瘋從古是一種神秘的疾病，因爲它的發作過於突兀，古人不是當它妖鬼附身，就是天神降譴，因此治療的方法也極盡愚笨，荒謬，悲慘，殘酷的能事，到了二十世紀，縱使醫學極度昌明，羊癲瘋依然是一種人類所不能控制的疾病，尤琴的一生勢必將長此埋葬下去。可是感謝一種新發明的羊癲瘋特效藥——「癲立停」（Dilantin），這個靑年終於獲救了。在今年夏季全美精神病學家協會大會的席上，著名的法平醫師扶着這位毫無病態的二十三歲靑年，揚揚得意地報告着這次驚人的洽療經過。</p>
<p>尤琴在去年十一月間開始醫治。法平醫師給他每天試服七厘半的「癲立停」藥片，不過三天，他的羊癲瘋發作就立刻完全停止，而從此不再復發，十七年來根深蒂固的頑疾不料竟是那樣的不堪一擊。</p>
<p>可是神志淸楚了的尤琴依然不是一個正常的人。他在十七年中好像做了一塲大夢，在夢中他絲毫也不曾學到點什麼，他的智能絲毫也沒有隨着歲月的消逝和軀體的長成而發展；夢醒後，二十三歲的他仍保留着六歲時天眞無邪，童騃無知的程度。因此這個大孩子的能吾補　敎育便成爲藥療成功後最迫切的問題。法平博士將這付重擔栘交給者名心理學家愛倫，並特請經騐豐富的法里曼夫人專任這位大孩子的保姆之職。</p>
<p>啟蒙的結果竟異常使人滿意。在循循善誘下，他的天性和智力像怒放的鮮花那樣迅速的開展了。在治療之始，他的智力年齡經測定是六·七歲，現在重行測騐，已增加到十·二歲；這就是說在五個月中，他的智能程度差不多要進步四年之多。由此證明長期的癲癎並沒像一般人想像中的那樣使病人的腦筋受到重大的損害</p>
<p>新生的尤琴現在正向着成人的途中邁進不巳。他在三星期中唸完了第一册課本，學會了加减乘除的算術；他知道了怎樣玩紙牌和各種球戲；他也會抱起一個周歲的嬰孩，逗弄着遊戲，像任何大人所能玩的一樣溫柔而親切；最近他甚至已能將自己修飾得溫文爾雅，舉止大方地在正式的交際塲所露面了。顯然，今後他決不再是一個無用的廢物，神效的新藥，巳使他復活而成爲一個有爲的靑年了。</p>
<p>他現在還每天吞服着「癲立停」，而且必要時或將這樣的終他的一生。但是這藥並沒有給他以任何輕微的痛苦。「癲立停」之爲新藥還不過短短二年的歷史。它是哈佛大學茂立脫博士和紐約神經病研究院普天奈院長二人三年潛心研究的結晶。在發明之前，經過無數次縝密的試騐，發明之後，再經世界各地醫師的臨床實習，「癲立停博得了「羊癲病人的救星」這個榮譽。二年以來，受它之賜而脫離苦海的何至數千，無怪全美醫師一致許爲精神病治療學上劃時代的貢獻。</p>
<p>羊癲瘋在我國無疑是相當普遍的，病人的悲慘命運較之外國恐怕還要有過之無不及，所以這位救星的降臨無疑也是千萬病人所企盼的。最近聽說本埠五洲藥廠已將這藥首先製造成功了，這自然是病人和醫家樂聞的好消息，筆者敢樂於在這裏一起的介紹出來，同時並替全國的羊癲病人祝福。</p>

<h3>失業</h3>
<p>— 丁流</p>
<p>拖着一身的疲乏，回到自己的寓所，立刻湧起了一陣不能遏止的痛苦和悲哀。像一隻折斷了翅膀的小鳥，可怕的從天空中翻跌下來，我實在不敢想像以後可怕的情景。我沉重地走進房，關了門，痴呆地坐在靠窗的凳上，沉思完全奪去了我思維的能力，房裏的空氣也凝固着。</p>
<p>窗外的天空也灰白地沉着臉袋，熱流緊緊的包圍着我的全身，渾濁的聲音不時的從窗外傳進來。</p>
<p>充滿在我腦筋裏的，是我們的校長底臉，是我永遠憎恨的臉。埋藏在表面的一層虛偽的微笑後面，是多麼兇惡殘忍</p>
<p>「對不起，王先生，請你高就吧，因爲……」他奸刁地微笑着，提了一支烟給我。</p>
<p>我呆立着，一陣可怕的陰影開始籠罩了我。我勉强支持住自己，冷靜下來，希望將三年來勤奮的工作來收同他的成見。但這嘗試是完全失敗了。</p>
<p>一陣小孩嬉戲的笑聲，震撼了我的神經，我突然從沉思中回復到自我，我感到了生存的威脅。……</p>
<p>許多雜亂的思想一齊集到我的腦中來，像小虫似的啃嚙着我，我實在不敢想像怎樣生活下去。</p>
<p>我想起了一篇喚作「失業」的小說，是描寫失業後的悲辛和悽苦，我不禁苦笑了。</p>
<p>蒸然的陽光，爬過我的窗口，漸漸西沉下去了。我再也不能忍耐快要磨折得破碎的心。四周的空氣更悶熱了起來，我渴慕着遠方的閃電和雷。</p>
<p>我衝出了門，走上街道。迷糊地加緊着脚步，憤恨和熱淚交迸着。</p>
<p>晚上，我做了一個可怕的噩夢。……在黑暗裏，許許多多鬼怪一齊緊圍着我，巨大的石塊壓向我的身來。……</p>
<p>我醒了，黑暗正無邊際的包圍着我，我沒有哭，因爲我知道靑年人的生活本來就是最堅苦的磨鍊，而且，我也知道黑暗正迅速的向後退去，黎明卽將來了。</p>

<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小青著</p>
<p>第六章　「把他押起來」</p>
<p>陸健笙沉着臉答道：「是的，可是我究竟不是傻子，當然不會相信，後來果然又得到一個證據——唉，倒霉！」</p>
<p>「倒什麼霉？伊的行動本來是自由的，你在法律上本沒有干涉他的權利啊。」</p>
<p>是的，可是我不能不恨。在十七日早上，我打電話到伊家裏去，伊竟一夜不歸，在外面過夜——」</p>
<p>「唔，其實這也算不得什麼。假使你處在你的妻子的地位，仔細想一想，那你也不會這樣量窄了啊。……以後怎麼樣呢？一</p>
<p>我馬上趕得去，伊還沒有回去。但不久伊也回家了，見了面又分明是一派鬼話。伊說上夜裏在一個賭塲裏賭了一夜，還贏了五百塊錢，因爲怕我說話，故而叫僕人們隱瞞着。霍先生，你不知道伊的口才眞好，當時我竟會相信伊。後來我前前後後地回想了一下，才知又受了伊的騙。咳，我眞恨伊！」</p>
<p>霍桑瞧着他的面，慢吞吞地說：恨伊，那當然是很自然的結果。不過你是不能求法律的救濟的；如果拋棄伊，那你反得拿出贍養費來，而且面子上又很難受；最好的洩恨方法，還是乾脆地把伊打死。是不是？」</p>
<p>陸健笙忽張着眼睛，搖頭說：「不，我不曾打死伊。打死的人是誰，我倒知道。」</p>
<p>倪金壽一聽這話，突然轉過臉來瞧那銀行家。「什麼，陸先生，你知道誰始兇手嗎？怎麼不早些告訴我們？」</p>
<p>陸健笙吞吐地說：這是你們當偵探的名分。你們自己應當查出來——」</p>
<p>霍桑向倪金壽瞧了一眼。金壽兄，別打岔。……兇手是誰？」</p>
<p>陸健笙答道：「就是那個姓趙的傢伙！」</p>
<p>霍桑對於這句加重氣語的報告，似乎並不感到驚異。他仍淡淡地問：「有會麼證據？」</p>
<p>陸健笙說：「昨天夜裏我和麗蘭在白梅酒家吃夜飯。我們坐的是單獨的小室，祇有我們兩人。吃到一半光景，那兩扇活絡的半門忽輕輕開動，麗蘭的身子突然一震，幾乎叫起來。我當然也吃了一驚。我雖不曾瞧見門隙中的人面，但那半門下面，却明明有一個穿着深灰色西裝的男子。我忙着立起來，要追出去瞧瞧是誰。麗蘭却拉住我不放。我當然問伊瞧見的是什麼人。伊說：『是個不相識的人，大概走錯了房間，沒有關係。』因爲伊的面包聲音，和那種不自然的強笑，都將伊的心事漏出來了。我知道這個人就是姓趙的。」</p>

<h3>卓別麟的安琪兒　寶蓮高黛成功經過</h3>
<p>— 清暉</p>
<p>幾年前卓別麟週遊世界，經過上海，記得他曾帶着一位女友，年紀輕輕，活潑美麗，她就是實蓮高黛PauletteGoddard。後來倦遊歸去。立刻謠傳他們秘密結婚的新聞，可是卓氏生性古怪，而高黛女士也是一位神秘女郎，所以他倆究竟是否正式結婚，還是一個謎。這裏姑且丟開，來一說寶蓮高黛的成功經過吧。</p>
<p>小家碧玉</p>
<p>她生長在美國長島（Long　Island）地方，出身是一個小家碧玉，最初在附近一個小鎭上讀書，她不肯好好用功，整日胡鬧。一天，在學校的遊藝會裏登了臺，她就發現了演戲的興趣，這樣就下了她那顆投身舞臺的野心。當她十五歲的那一年，她的父母就讓她在「麗娃麗姐」＂Rio　Rita，中擔任配角，然而這並沒有特殊的成功。</p>
<p>一舉成名</p>
<p>可是却引起了卓別麟的注意，結了深厚的友誼，夜總會裏同出進，同時，他更對她晨夕的訓練，天天的孫磨，捧上了影壇，給她在「摩登時代」一片中充任女主角，因而一舉成名。從此她盛妝艷服，儀態萬方，交際廣闊。那時，她却是好萊塢令人最羨慕的女子，無論那方面，她都稱心滿意。</p>
<p>重情感恩</p>
<p>然而高黛女士是一個不忘情義有恩必報的女子，雖說報恩二字在好萊塢是一種不曾見過的美德，但是高黛確是一個重情感恩的人。她不單感激卓氏提携她身登影壇之恩，她又感激卓氏平日給她的恩悄。因此，飲水思源，不能不五體投地的感恩卓氏了。</p>
<p>作品一束</p>
<p>雖然高黛到好萊塢已經有九個年頭，可是上銀幕的機會卻很少，自從「摩登時代」以後，四年來一直無聲無息，直到去年，她咬緊牙根，努力苦幹，來爭取錦繡的前程。先後會和珍妮蓋諾合演「柔陽九廻一和露薏絲蕾納合演「藝苑之花」，和瑙瑪希拉合演，「女人」。最近新作除了與卓氏再度合演的「大獨裁者」外，還有，＂North　West　Mounted　Police”是西席地密爾導演的偉大傑作，預定由費文麗或瑪琳黛德麗主演，結果却被這位埋沒好久的天才影人獲得了。的確，高黛女士的前程，實在未可限量！</p>

<h3>文武香球一插圖</h3>
<p>— 鄭耀祖</p>
<p>每星期看凍雲岫烟兩先生合作的『彈詞二十種」，倒亦別有風味。尤其是那一幅綫條爽利潑辣而又緊湊的挿圖，把才子佳人的面目情景，活生生地充分表露出來。較之街頭圖書館—小書攤上的連環圖書册裏的，簡直犬差地遠了。</p>
<p>文武杳球是二十種裏的最後一種了。挿圖是龍官保和張桂英的「一馬雙馱」圖。在下雖然是毛頭小夥子，倒亦喜歡聽聽書。記得在東方書塲聽周玉泉的文武香球到張桂英救出龍官保，一馬雙馱時，周玉泉說龍官保那時是反騎在馬背上的。並且用繩子和張桂英背對背縛起來。據他說這是因爲龍官保是又弱書生，不耐馬奔跑跳躍的顚簸震盪，防他會從馬背上跌下來；二是張桂英恐怕龍官保在逃出性命之後，在馬背上兩隻手會有不規行動。說來亦未始沒有道理，但確吾待證。岫烟先生亦以爲有參考價值否？</p>
<h3>電影宣傳的力量</h3>
<p>— 明</p>
<p>歐戰爆發以來，各交戰國竭力利用電影爲宣傳工具。德國爲鼓勵共所佔領的波蘭西部人民，移殖波蘭中部起見，特攝宣傳影片一部，近已完成，內容所述，當然是波蘭西部民衆移殖中部時興高采烈的情形。實在說來，這些可憐的波蘭人，扶老携幼，離別其祖先世代遺傳的故里，跋涉長途，到人地生疏的中部，內心痛苦，不難想見。據說這影片中扮「波蘭農民」的演員，所貪的無非是優厚的酬報而已。</p>
<h3>全聯口琴隊　大光明演奏</h3>
<p>全滬聯合口琴隊由口琴名家李厚襄集合全上海口琴團體中之最優秀人材，今應美國第四海軍樂隊之邀，參加九月十五日上午十時之星期昔樂會節目大合奏，有德音樂家舒伯德之B短調第八交響樂與意大利名歌劇漂浪詩人拔萃曲外，並有靑年口琴家舒錫禮君之口琴獨奏，蕭邦變E調夜曲與盧榮滋君等之口琴五重奏，伯特勞斯基小步舞等精彩節目，愛好口琴者，可於是日提早至大光朋戲院聆奏，以免向隅。</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Eliminating Black Market Trading in Rice</h3>
<p>The rice market is faltering as if stricken by apoplexy. Recently, the high points of seventy yuan for foreign rice and eighty yuan for japonica rice have been reached, representing a five-fold increase over pre-war prices. An investigation of the city's rice reserves, excluding those held by rice shops and households, reveals that warehouses alone hold a substantial 635,000 bags. Furthermore, the autumn harvest in various regions is good, and new grains are arriving at the port in a continuous stream of large and small ships. Yet, such unprecedentedly high prices have been created. If this is not due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding and manipulating the market, what else could it be?</p>
<p>Originally, the intention was to stabilize rice prices and prevent manipulation by the black market. The solution was thought to be centralized buying and selling, public pricing, and market management, which would bring stability to rice prices. However, the pricing method has been accommodating and lax, while centralized management has remained largely symbolic. Even when rice prices have fallen repeatedly, the official prices have remained stubbornly high. And as rice prices have risen again and again, the official prices have been repeatedly adjusted upward. Although at times, under the pressure of public opinion, there have been proclamations of maintaining the original pricing, the black market has been allowed to exceed the official price by eight or nine yuan without any intervention. This makes it clear that the official pricing is knowingly allowing manipulation. Truly, seeking price stabilization with unscrupulous merchants is like seeking the skin of a tiger. If the law were strictly enforced without leniency, would those who commit illegal acts not know that they would be punished for violating the law? It is only because the authorities are accommodating and lenient, and because the common interests of the industry are shared, that no one is willing to break the code of silence or report truthfully and enforce the law impartially. Sharing profits and colluding in wrongdoing have become an open secret. The so-called supervisory and corrective responsibilities, the so-called power to discipline, are all but smoke screens to deceive the public, allowing unscrupulous merchants to act with impunity and commit their crimes.</p>
<p>The greatest failure of the current pricing scheme is that it follows the same path as the price controls on japonica rice. At that time, there were price controls on japonica rice but not on foreign rice. When the price of foreign rice skyrocketed, the wall of restrictions on japonica rice collapsed without a single attack. Rice merchants must have used a threatening rhetoric, arguing that uniform price restrictions would deter those purchasing foreign rice, further depleting supplies and intensifying panic. Therefore, they insisted on a double standard, with leniency on one side and strictness on the other, to avoid shortages. As a result, only japonica rice was restricted, while foreign rice was left unregulated. Little did they know that any "exceptions" in the regulatory measures would lead to a proliferation of abuses. The eventual demise of japonica rice price controls was precisely due to the discriminatory nature of the price control measures. Today, the pricing scheme is again limited to foreign rice, neglecting japonica and domestic rice, and ignoring the black market as if it were non-existent. Are they unaware that the Shanghai Municipal Council's announcement of japonica rice price controls has not been explicitly revoked? Exploiting loopholes and manipulating the law, they operate within the system while pretending not to intentionally undermine the authority of the authorities. As for their own selfish and self-serving pricing, they seem to adhere to it and adapt it as needed. They openly and brazenly engage in black market trading without any restraint. How could it have come to this? The pricing method is not inherently flawed in principle, but it is not implemented effectively.</p>
<p>I believe that the authorities, for the sake of the millions of residents in the city, for the sake of the overall market, and for the sake of security, should investigate hidden loyalties, make a firm decision, and engage in eliminating the black market, stabilizing rice prices, and regulating the food supply. They should understand that this cannot be achieved by holding a few meetings and making a few speeches. What is needed is a policy, a plan, the appointment of capable individuals, the granting of real power, the encouragement of action, and the assignment of responsibility. A systematic organization should be created to coordinate the overall interests. If efforts are made piecemeal, or are inconsistent, or follow old routines and are perfunctory and irresponsible, then the dire consequences will not be far off, and it will be more than just a hidden danger.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Issue of Passage Through Vietnam are Deadlocked; US States Japan Will Encounter Difficulties; Germany Also Does Not Approve</h3>
<p>Hong Kong. The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao today quoted a diplomatic source as saying that the Vichy government has agreed to the Japanese request to allow Japanese troops to pass through Vietnam. The newspaper reported that the French government instructed Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux to conduct detailed consultations with Japanese Major General Nishihara. The condition for Japanese troops passing through Vietnam is that they not exceed half of the French troops. However, Tokyo is requesting that 60,000 Japanese troops be allowed to pass through, as well as the hiring of local labor and the use of Vietnamese airfields. Governor-General Decoux rejected the Japanese demands, and negotiations are continuing in deadlock. At the same time, the Ta Kung Pao stated that Vietnam remains extremely friendly to the Chongqing government and would welcome Chinese troops if the Japanese attack Vietnam.

<p>Washington. Today's report from Hanoi that the French-Japanese conference has been suspended indefinitely is consistent with the view held here that Japanese troops invading China via Vietnam will encounter significant resistance. Although, the possibility of a French-Japanese agreement, whether formal or tacit, has not been completely ruled out by diplomatic circles. As for the Japanese attempting to carry out significant military operations via Vietnam, this is not surprising here. However, it is widely believed that the Japanese will face many difficulties in practice, as the roads are rugged and the railways are limited. As a result, they will inevitably encounter Chinese resistance. Secretary of State Hull has stated that the United States is very concerned about this, not only because of its diplomatic stance, but also because the United States obtains significant raw materials from Vietnam or transships them through Vietnam. For example, Chinese tung oil, tungsten ore, etc., were transshipped through Vietnam before the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and the Burma Road were blockaded. Moreover, the diplomatic obstacles encountered by the Japanese are not only the opposition of China, France, and the Soviet Union, but also the disapproval of Germany. According to unofficial reports, the view held by senior German officials is that Germany's war strategy is not for Japan or any other non-Axis countries, but only for the benefit of the German-Italian Axis. Although this news has not been confirmed, it has excited people, who believe that it at least means that Germany is helping France refuse some of Japan's demands.

<p>Tokyo. Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma told reporters today that we have received a telegram from Japanese officials in Vietnam and that we believe that the negotiations between the Japanese and French authorities have made some progress. Reporters urged him to state definitively whether the negotiations had made good progress without interruption, or whether the negotiations were proceeding smoothly. The spokesman replied that we understand that Japanese officials in the area are currently working hard to make progress in the negotiations. He could not use any adjectives to describe the situation of the negotiations. Reporters also asked whether it was true that Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux had sent three telegrams to President Roosevelt, asking the United States to assist in the French-Japanese negotiations. The spokesman replied that he had not received any official confirmation of this. (Dispatch of the 13th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Four Waves of Japanese Aircraft Attack Chongqing; German Embassy Bombed; Methodist Church School Also Destroyed; Jialing Apartments Uninhabitable</h3>
<p>Chongqing. Four waves of Japanese aircraft have again carried out bombing raids over Chongqing. The German embassy was directly hit and destroyed. In the same area, the dormitories of the Methodist Church Middle School were also destroyed this afternoon. The Jialing Apartments, which are run by the government and intended for foreign residents, are no longer habitable due to the extensive damage sustained over the past two days. There were no deaths or injuries when the German embassy was destroyed, as the embassy staff reside and work in a location on the south bank of the Yangtze River. However, German embassy officials said that although the embassy has a temporary office on the south bank of the Yangtze River, the destroyed building was the official facility. The bombs fell directly on the embassy roof, where the swastika flag was erected. After the bombing, the swastika flag was still standing upright, but the embassy building had been reduced to ashes. A major fire broke out in the bombed area today and took an hour to extinguish. The area on the south bank of the Yangtze River is mostly foreign-owned property, and most of the residents are foreigners. It was also bombed today. The air raid alarm lasted for four hours and was lifted at 2:00 PM. (Dispatch of the 13th, United Press)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Yesterday at noon and at 7:10 PM, one hundred Japanese aircraft flew into the wartime capital again in two successive waves, dropping countless bombs on the lower city and residential areas, but there were no casualties. In this raid on Chongqing, the Japanese aircraft imitated the Germans and began using low-flying bombers during the noon raid. New architectural areas on the south bank of the Yangtze River and on the outskirts of the capital were bombed at noon. The editorial office of the Shih-shih Hsin-pao was also destroyed. The second wave consisted of five teams of Japanese aircraft, apparently from the Yichang airfield, which invaded the area in the bright moonlight. However, they encountered intense anti-aircraft fire. During this time, cities near Chongqing were also bombed. It is reported that in the first air raid, the Chinese shot down one Japanese low-flying aircraft. (Dispatch of the 13th, United Press)</p>
<p>Chongqing. Thirty-six Japanese aircraft bombed the western suburbs of Chongqing this afternoon, causing a major fire in one location. The air raids of the past two days suggest that these bombings are not targeting any specific objectives but are merely for harassment. It is reported that a total of forty-six Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing yesterday, dropping bombs on the south bank of the Yangtze River and the western suburbs. Six of the Japanese aircraft were light dive bombers that carried out a dive-bombing attack for the first time. Several bombs fell near the British Ambassador's residence. The Shih-shih Hsin-pao building has been destroyed, and the Jialing Mansion has also been affected. Yesterday afternoon, three Japanese aircraft raided Chongqing, dropping many bombs in the lower city area. (Dispatch of the 13th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Meets with Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies; Matsuoka Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo. Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma stated today that we hope that Envoy Kobayashi, who is traveling to the Dutch East Indies, can begin negotiations with the Dutch authorities there as soon as possible. Kobayashi arrived in Batavia at 8:00 AM yesterday and paid a visit to Governor-General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer at 6:00 PM, along with Japanese Consul General Saito, for a one-hour meeting.

<p>Singapore. The Singapore Japanese Daily, which is run by the Japanese, recently published a commentary on the visit of the Japanese delegation to the Dutch East Indies, arguing that Japan should seek a supply of oil from the Dutch East Indies, and that oil from the oil wells in the Dutch East Indies is one of Japan's main necessities. At a time when war has broken out in Europe and the United States is reserving more of its war materials for the European war, Japan should seek its main supplies from various sources. Malaya has already supplied Japan with rubber and tin, but Japan also relies heavily on the Dutch East Indies for its greater needs. (Dispatch of the 13th, Taiwanese Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo. Foreign Minister Matsuoka recently stated in a speech at the Japan Trade Association that Japan's "Greater East Asia" construction program is currently focused on obtaining raw materials and planning the sources of supply. Commerce and Industry Minister Kobayashi's trip to the Dutch East Indies is related to the objectives of Japan's current policy. "In order to build Greater East Asia and the common prosperity within the scope of this Greater East Asia, it is necessary to cooperate with countries that have the same requirements and at the same time eliminate all the obstacles that have been discovered or have not yet been discovered." Matsuoka believes that the European war has greatly reduced Japan's export trade and that the days when Japanese goods were sold in the world market due to their good quality and low price have passed. "Due to the recent war tensions and the deterioration of our relations with the United States, the problem of obtaining mainly goods has become increasingly difficult." Matsuoka also said that creating prosperity in Asia and bringing peace to the world is the mission of the Japanese nation and all East Asian nations. (Dispatch of the 13th, United Press)</p>

<p>Moscow. Recent reports from the German Secret Service and radio broadcasts have appeared in various foreign newspapers, stating that the German government will convene a conference of experts in Vienna to discuss the international problems of the Danube River in order to change the current international status of the river. Regarding this matter, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vishinsky met with German Ambassador Schulenburg on the 10th and stated to Schulenburg that since the Soviet Union is a country bordering the Danube River, it cannot ignore the river's navigation system. The Soviet Union must participate in any decisions concerning the river. In view of this, the Soviet government hopes to obtain accurate information from the German government regarding the Vienna conference. The German ambassador replied that he would inquire with his government about this matter. (Dispatch of the 13th, TASS)</p>

<h3>British Efforts to Promote Anglo-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>London: According to reliable sources, Britain has proposed to Moscow a resolution of the dispute between them arising from the Soviet annexation of the Baltic states. It is claimed that Britain has suggested that Moscow's claim to the Baltic banks' gold reserves of £4 million held in London be offset against Britain's claim to investments of £5.5 million in the Baltic states. It is also reported that Britain has suggested that the respective claims could be dealt with flexibly, pending further discussion after the war ends. Reliable sources also say that Britain has expressed its willingness to charter thirty or forty Latvian or Estonian ships for use in British territorial waters. However, political circles believe that Moscow will reject this proposal, since Britain's attitude is rather arrogant, and acceptance of the proposal would mean that the gold reserves and ships of the Baltic states claimed by the Soviet Union would fall into British hands, and the Soviet Union has no strong interest in such a "dishonorable proposal."

<h3>General von Brauchitsch Inspects Troops in France; Large-Scale Attack on England Expected Soon; Small Fleet Assembled Off French Coast Awaiting Orders; Autumn Tides Favorable for German Operations</h3>
<p>London: London expects Germany to attack England today. Well-informed sources generally believe that since Hitler began his "inferior victory" political career, those who have studied him believe that this "Nazi Caesar" will never directly attack England, but will attack the southeastern coast of England at the narrowest point in the Dover Strait. It is rumored that a small fleet off the French coast is preparing to sail. Reliable sources believe that the greatest pain currently felt by Londoners is the distraction of British attention due to preparations for a German invasion. The British Air Force has inflicted severe blows on the enemy fleet, but it is generally believed that this is not enough to cope with a large-scale German offensive. British authorities believe that the German leader will launch an attack within the next ten days, but it is said that his major offensive will be delayed until next spring. (International News Service, 13th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to newspapers, the German invasion of Britain began at 9:00 PM on the 11th when German planes launched a fierce attack on Britain. Londoners already know that Germany is preparing ships to sail to the British coast under the cover of coastal batteries when the invasion begins. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, inspected the German troops stationed in France over the past two days and visited the ports along the Atlantic coast. These ports are the base for the German Navy's operations against England. Von Brauchitsch toured the ports by motorboat and encountered many submarines and minesweepers along the way. Sailors on warships in each port lined up on the deck to welcome the Commander-in-Chief. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German sources claim that General von Brauchitsch is "currently inspecting troops in northern France." From this, it can be seen that the British claim that Germany will invade England soon is accurate as the German side concentrates its troop transport ships, seemingly preparing for a quick crossing of the short 20-mile channel to land in England.

However, the form of this final struggle cannot be predicted for the time being. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<h3>London Suffers Two Air Raids in One Day; Buckingham Palace Bombed Again; King and Queen Safe in Air Raid Shelter; Downing Street Also Bombed, No Damage Caused</h3>
<p>London: Buckingham Palace, which had been slightly damaged by a delayed-action bomb a few days ago, sustained further damage from several bombs dropped during today's longest daytime air raid on London. Fortunately, the King and Queen were both unharmed. It was observed that a German twin-engine bomber dived down from the clouds over the palace, and the pilot seemed to reduce speed. Immediately afterwards, the sound of bombs falling and exploding followed in succession. The King and Queen both took refuge in an air raid shelter inside the palace. One of the bombs completely destroyed the Royal Chapel, and two bombs landed in the lawn, creating huge craters. The main water pipe was broken, and many doors and windows were shattered. Three palace staff members sustained minor injuries because the air raid shelter they took refuge in was too close to the destroyed chapel. Troops and police from the Wellington Barracks and others rushed to the site of the bombing upon hearing the sound and extinguished the fires caused by incendiary bombs near the palace. Several incendiary bombs also fell on Downing Street, but caused no damage. The air raid began at 8:40 AM this morning and lasted for about four hours. Regent Street, Berkeley Square, Cannon Street, and Watling Street were also bombed. As far as is currently known, the offices of the "Daily Herald" and the "Evening Standard" were hit by bombs, and a cinema attached to Madame Tussaud's famous wax museum was also struck. According to the Air Ministry, in yesterday's air battles, Germany lost a total of 56 heavy bombers and 22 fighter-bombers, and at least 250 airmen were killed. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London: The War Cabinet today sent congratulations to the King and Queen for their escape from the air raid. The King replied to the Prime Minister by telegram, saying, "The Queen and I are grateful for the War Cabinet's congratulations. We have now, like so many other people, gained first-hand experience of the barbarity of the Germans. This behavior of the Germans can only strengthen our determination to fight to final victory."

<h3>London's Air Raid Alarms Frequent Yesterday; New Defense Measures Prove Effective</h3>
<p>London: London issued its second daytime air raid alarm at 8:40 AM this morning. Following the first alarm at 6:37 AM, anti-aircraft batteries in the southwest area opened fire on German planes. The German planes were using low clouds as cover. Although the alarm was sounding, a large number of citizens continued to work as usual. The bridges over the Thames River were crowded with pedestrians, and most buses continued to run. The first alarm was lifted at 7:32 AM. London's new defense method for repelling night-time enemy aircraft, which involves creating a formidable network of fire with anti-aircraft guns without the aid of searchlights, seemed less continuous last night than the night before, but the concentration of firepower was perhaps even greater whenever the sound of German planes was heard. According to a joint communiqué from the Air Ministry and the Home Security Department, although the enemy air raid last night was small in scale, many areas of the British enclave were affected. Single or small groups of enemy aircraft were fiercely intercepted by British defenses in many places. Although the enemy aircraft dropped many high-explosive and incendiary bombs in and around the City of London and caused several fires, the damage was far less than the previous night. Detailed reports of casualties are not yet available, but as far as is currently known, casualties in the London area were very light. Some houses were destroyed and there were minor casualties in two towns in Lancashire and a town in the east suburbs of London. The Midlands suffered an unprecedentedly long period of strafing, but the damage was very slight apart from property damage, and casualties were also few. A Catholic church west of London was hit by a bomb and burned down last night, leaving only the four walls standing. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London: The third air raid alarm of the day sounded in the London area at 2:55 PM this afternoon. A few minutes later, the sound of machine guns could be heard in the air. The alarm was lifted at 3:13 PM. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Sixth Day of German Night Air Raids; British Release Casualty Report</h3>
<p>London: German bombers soared over London at 9:10 PM yesterday. This was the sixth day of continuous German night raids on London. Ground batteries immediately opened fire fiercely, and a few searchlights were seen flashing. The alarm had not been lifted by 11:30 PM, but the gunfire was sparse. Details of the attack are not yet known. It is reported that during the recent attacks on London, bombs fell near several important buildings, such as the Bank of England, Mansion House, and St. Paul's Cathedral, and delayed-action bombs were discovered. The offices of the "Daily Herald" and "Evening Standard" newspapers were hit by bombs, and a cinema attached to Madame Tussaud's famous wax museum was also bombed. On the 12th, the first air raid alarm in London sounded at nearly 4:00 PM. The drone of aircraft engines could be heard in the distance, but there was no gunfire, indicating that the attacking enemy aircraft had been blocked far away, as there was no development in the London area. The alarm was lifted at 4:40 PM. The Air Ministry's Information Office stated that yesterday afternoon, 150 German bombers, escorted by fighters, launched an attack. Two squadrons of Hurricane fighters successfully intercepted them head-on, protecting London from the attack. Eighteen of the enemy aircraft flying towards London were confirmed to have been shot down, and many other enemy aircraft may not have been able to return to their original defenses. Some enemy aircraft were chased to the coast and escaped across the Channel. A few other small teams of weak enemy aircraft attempted to infiltrate London but were also shot down by British aircraft. The remaining aircraft dropped bombs in the woods and then fled back. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Last night's German attack lasted for eight and a half hours and was not completely lifted until 4:55 AM this morning. It is not known what damage was caused in the center of London during this attack. Yesterday, the total casualties from air raids in the London area were 165 dead and 420 injured. The afternoon bombing killed 125 and injured 250, while the night bombing killed 40 and injured 170. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>London Under Attack Like a City of the Dead; Thames River Banks Severely Damaged</h3>
<p>London: London was like a city of the dead on Wednesday night, as thousands of refugees in the city took shelter in underground chambers and tunnels 75 feet below ground all night to avoid air raids. The shaking of windows, the burst of shrapnel during explosions, the sound of shattering glass, the sound of airplane engines, and the rumbling of guns and cannons were mixed together and did not stop all night. Although no searchlights were used that night, the bright light from the anti-aircraft fire made the houses along the streets as bright as pictures. People considered even short distances of a few feet on the street to be dangerous areas and dared not walk across them. Many famous hotels near the bridges over the Thames River were included, as an unexploded bomb had fallen there. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Photos taken by German reconnaissance planes of London yesterday clearly show that some areas in the suburbs and city of London are completely unrecognizable. There are still 33 fires burning, one of which has a diameter of at least 500 meters. The destructive power of German bombs has caused unbelievable devastation to the oil pools in Victoria Harbour, the factories, warehouses, and cold storage facilities on both banks of the Thames River. Without consulting a map, it is impossible to recognize the docks in Silvertown, downstream on the Thames River. (Haitong Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Many Time Bombs Explode; Reuters Headquarters Unharmed</h3>

<p>London: The British Air Force flew across the Channel yesterday to intensify its offensive to curb German aggression. One German supply ship was sunk and two were damaged. The British Air Force bombed the large-scale transport tools of the German side along the Channel coast while also bombing important targets in Berlin, Hamburg, Bremen, Wilhelmshaven, and other German cities, aiming to achieve a pincer effect. The destructive air battle between Britain and Germany was so fierce that it can be described as unprecedented. According to the British side, Berlin's famous Tempelhof Airport, Anhalter and Potsdamer stations, and anti-aircraft positions in the Tiergarten district were all destroyed on Thursday.

<h3>Italy Divides Troops into Three Routes; Prepares to Attack Egypt; To Coordinate with German Military Operations; Italian Troops in Libya Busy Moving</h3>
<p>London: Responsible sources in London say that Italian troop movements have recently been detected near Gaps in northern Libya, but the Italian troops have not yet invaded the Egyptian border. It is rumored that the Italian side is currently forming three armies to attack Egypt in separate routes: one route will proceed along the coast past Solum; the second route will head northwest from Kassala to Faddia; the third route will advance along the Sudanese-Egyptian border from its base near Tachida. However, this route of Italian troops must travel directly through 400 miles of waterless desert before it can reach Faddia and coordinate with the second army departing from Kassala. According to experienced military experts here, a sudden Italian attack is possible, but the claim that a large number of troops are advancing from this direction cannot be easily believed. As far as is currently known, there are no German troops assisting the Italian troops in Libya. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>New York: Italy's advance from Egypt towards the Suez Canal and the intensified air raids between Germany and Britain show yesterday that the European war has gradually reached a new climax. Unconfirmed reports from Rome claim that Italy's three-pronged invasion of British positions in Egypt has already begun, and hinted that this attack will be launched at the same time as the climax of the war with Britain and the German army's landing in England. Two main forces of the Italian army are reportedly advancing from Libya along the Mediterranean coast towards Egypt, with the ultimate goal of cutting off Britain's "lifeline." The mutual air raids between the Italian and British fleets in North Africa on Wednesday were the prelude to this offensive. At the same time, Germany is showing increasing signs of preparing to invade England. (United Press, 13th)</p>

<h3>US Embargo on Scrap Iron Exports Planned; Roosevelt Considering; US-Japan Relations Worsen</h3>
<p>Washington: Scrap iron experts today recommended to the National Defense Committee that scrap iron exports be banned. The committee will forward the report to the White House. Yesterday, several representatives from the Scrap Iron Research Association held consultations with Maxwell, Director of Export Administration, but no decision was reached. A spokesman announced to the public that the research association had discussed the matter of scrap iron exports with the National Defense Committee and that it was rumored that a stronger ban on exports had been drafted. As for news from the National Defense Committee, the report has indeed been submitted to the White House, but officials have not yet indicated whether President Roosevelt will strengthen the ban on exports in the near future.

<p>Washington: California Democratic Representative Henry Ellenbogen claimed yesterday that relations between the United States and Japan "may be on the verge of rupture." If the situation becomes serious, "we should isolate ourselves to cope with it." Ellenbogen also inserted an article written by Japanese journalist Kawakami into the Congressional Record. According to the article, Japan deeply understands that trying to maintain friendly relations with the United States has been ineffective, so it has no choice but to change its policy or lean towards joining hands with Britain, as it is easier to cooperate with them in the Far East. The article was published in "Foreign Affairs Magazine." Ellenbogen believes that the article must have been approved by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs before it was published. Furthermore, the objectives of Britain and the United States in the Far East seem to lack coordination, and under certain policies, the two countries are clearly in a position of conflict. Ellenbogen commented, "Judging from various facts, as well as the international situation and the activities of our government, a rift between us and Japan is inevitable. However, once we are indeed in a rupture, it is necessary for us to isolate ourselves to cope with it. It is impossible to see the outcome of the final situation in the shortest period of time. Even after a long period of stalemate, neither side will see any benefit. In short, this issue depends on how both sides decide to act." (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>New York: The "New York Post" recently published an article advocating a complete ban on scrap iron exports to Japan and fortifying Wake Island and Midway Island. The newspaper said that the United States is facing dangers in both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans, and that the United States' two-ocean navy may not be fully completed before 1946.

<h3>US Powder Factory Explosion in New Jersey; Over Three Hundred Dead and Injured</h3>
<p>Dover, New Jersey: The Hercules powder factory near Kenvil, New Jersey, experienced a mysterious explosion yesterday. The blast resounded like thunder, and the factory was destroyed. At least fifty people are dead and three hundred are injured. Everyone suspects that this may have been the work of saboteurs. A very large powder magazine narrowly escaped being affected. If it had also exploded, the entire village would have been destroyed. This disaster is a new record in the history of American powder explosions. President Roosevelt has specifically ordered the Red Cross and the Army Department to quickly prepare relief efforts. Almost all of the buildings on the 1,800-acre factory site have been destroyed, and all residents of the area have been ordered to evacuate. It was also heard just now that another powder magazine spewed out huge flames late last night. The magazine stored 250,000 pounds of gunpowder, which was manufactured under secret orders for use by the United States and Britain. (International Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Washington: The Director of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover, today took responsibility on behalf of the government for thoroughly investigating the explosion at the Hercules powder factory in Kenvil, New Jersey. Hoover began the investigation less than four hours after the news of the explosion arrived. He said that he is thoroughly investigating the matter of sabotage. (International News Service, 13th)</p>

<h3>Romanian Army Provocative Actions Against the Soviet Union Again; The Soviet Union Lodges Another Protest</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Deputy Commissar of the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs met with the Romanian Minister to Moscow, Gafencu, yesterday and made the following statement: "At 1:00 PM on September 11, in the Balos Hill area (34 kilometers southeast of Zhichinowetz), Romanian troops suddenly opened machine gun and rifle fire on Soviet sentries. When another team of Soviet border guards moved towards the firing point, they were also shot at. The Soviet border guards were forced to retaliate. The Soviet government protested the provocative behavior of the Romanian army on August 29, but has not yet received a response. At the same time, the Romanian army resumed its provocative behavior on the 11th. The Soviet government hereby requests the Romanian government to pay attention to this kind of behavior again, which is by no means tolerable by the Soviet side." The Romanian Minister replied immediately that he would forward the Romanian government's reply to the Soviet government's protest on August 29 to the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs on the 13th. As for the new provocative behavior on September 11, the Romanian side will conduct an investigation. Once verified, the perpetrators will be severely punished. (TASS Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italy Sends Note: Pétain Government Asked to Demobilize North African French Forces, Rejected by France</h3>
<p>New York - According to reliable sources, the Pétain government received a note from Italy demanding the full demobilization of the North African French forces. They also received a note from Germany demanding the surrender of 58% of the livestock in the unoccupied French territory. It is reported that the French government rejected both demands. Italy's request is based on the reasoning that the 200,000 North African French troops might join General de Gaulle, the leader of the Free French in London, greatly increasing the strength of British forces in the Mediterranean. Italy now sees the Mediterranean as a major threat to its invasion of Egypt. Well-informed circles in Washington believe that France's current rejection of the Axis powers' demands may result in the Pétain government being overthrown, or the German and Italian troops occupying all of France or a larger portion than they do now.

<h3>European War Talks (5): The Day Paris Fell</h3>
<p>Paris, renowned worldwide for its prosperity, a city of indulgence and pleasure, often called the "City of Light," became a ghost town when it fell on June 14th of this year. This article is a record by Otto D. Tolischus, the Berlin bureau chief of the United Press, who personally witnessed the German army's entry into Paris in the evening. The original article was published in the July 8th issue of the American illustrated weekly "Life." It is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Since the German army launched its general offensive in the west on May 10th, I have passed through many cities in Belgium and northern France that have become ruins and deserted. However, the impression I received on June 14th, when I followed the vanguard of the German army into Paris, the capital of France, was the most unforgettable. Although I was there, I could hardly believe that such a prosperous and bustling metropolis had turned into a ghost town. Yet, the city was indeed deathly silent. It also seemed unbelievable that Paris had fallen into the hands of the German army, but it was indeed the German army that occupied the French capital.</p>
<p>Apart from the Paris city police still standing guard at street corners, not a single person could be found in this metropolis of four million residents. The residents had long since fled under the irresistible offensive of the German army. Seventy percent had fled to nearby towns, and thirty percent remained indoors.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to Paris can imagine what it was like: the Place de la Concorde, which was always bustling with traffic, honking cars, shouting newspaper vendors, police directing traffic, and people chatting - all of this was now gone. Only occasionally would a car carrying German officers, honking its horn, break the silence and head towards the German headquarters hastily set up in the most luxurious Hotel Crillon. The swastika flag flew on the roof of the hotel. In 1919, American President Wilson was cheered by the French people on the balcony of this hotel, and the star-spangled American flag also flew on the roof.</p>
<p>The desolate scene at the Place de la Concorde was the same everywhere else. The boulevards were lined with cafes, where people used to sit and sip aperitifs, full of life; now, they were deserted, with a ghostly feeling. We saw one cafe still open on the Champs-Élysées. None of the luxurious hotels in the famous hotel district of Paris were not tightly shuttered. We saw the swastika flag replacing the red, white, and blue tricolor flag on the Eiffel Tower, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the City Hall, waving in the wind. The most striking of these was the German flag on the Arc de Triomphe.</p>
<p>Finally, around ten o'clock in the evening, we saw a German officer coming through the Opera Avenue, and we asked him if there was a hotel where we could spend the night. He replied, "The Hotel Scribe has been requisitioned by our army. You might try your luck there." A group of us, because we had been living in the trenches, our clothes unironed and wrinkled, tired and weary, covered in dust, dragged our feet towards the Hotel Scribe. The polite manager of the hotel was taken aback when he saw this unkempt group of people. He hurriedly said, "I'm very sorry, but the headquarters has requisitioned all 160 rooms here for senior German officers."</p>
<p>There were nine foreign journalists in our group (three of whom were American), along with representatives from the Ministry of the Army, the Propaganda Department, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a total of thirty people. The leader, a major, after hearing the manager's words, said firmly, "I order you to find rooms for our group."</p>
<p>We were starving, but the hotel manager insisted that there was nothing to eat. However, he said, "He knew that some German officers had eaten breakfast and dinner at the Hotel Ritz, so you might want to try your luck there." Our group of journalists who couldn't be seen by anyone marched to the Hotel Ritz. The manager of the Hotel Ritz was already a little unsteady on his feet, and almost fainted when he saw this large group of people. He muttered that the kitchen was already "closed" and that the cooks and waiters had gone home. Our valiant major was not deceived. He gave an order to the drivers: "Drivers, attention." They immediately lined up, their heels clicking together.</p>
<p>"Who among you knows how to cook?" A round-faced, chubby man among the drivers immediately replied, "Sir, I can cook, at your command." Our leader said to them, "You all go to the kitchen to help."</p>
<p>Five minutes later, two drivers wearing long boots, their footsteps loud, led us towards the basement. Holding their breath, they carried a box of champagne. Of course, there were no wine glasses or dishes, so they took the whole bottle of champagne out of the box and handed it to us. No one found it strange.</p>
<p>Suddenly, four waiters appeared in evening dress, impeccably clean. We don't know how the hotel manager found them. Perhaps he thought that in such a luxurious hotel, it would be a bit impolite to the hotel for the rough soldiers to clumsily serve food like on the battlefield. Strangely enough, delicious ham, soft cheese, and perfectly cooked fried eggs were served one after another. This was the delicacy we tasted on our first night in Paris.</p>
<p>On the first night I entered Paris with the German army, I had an unforgettable impression. It was dusk, and we were slowly touring the city center. The first thing that caught my eye was the historical Arc de Triomphe, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier of the European War, and the "Eternal Flame." Many refugees were gathered here. The scene was too tragic to bear. Widows and young women were distraught, children were tugging at their clothes, crying. Old men with white hair were also shedding tears down their cheeks.</p>
<p>The accompanying officer whispered in my ear: "We have no complaints about the French soldiers who fought bravely. We are only dissatisfied with those politicians who have misled the country." Several others told me that they truly understood how tragic the French soldiers would feel when they imagined standing in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Unter den Linden Avenue in Berlin. German officers and soldiers saluted the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier as they passed through the Arc de Triomphe. The day after entering Paris, they also prepared a large wreath made of red, white, and blue flowers, decorated with black ribbons, and placed it in front of the tomb.</p>
<p>At this tomb, I also gained another profound impression. What was a sorrow for France was a joy for Germany. It was Sunday, June 16th. The Iron Army led by General von Brauchitsch marched through the Champs-Élysées, through the Arc de Triomphe, to the Avenue Foch. To the French, this was clearly a humiliation; to the Germans, this was the common wish of every citizen since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. Hitler also had a deep meaning in choosing this army to enter Paris. General von Brauchitsch's troops had achieved glorious victories in the Battle of Kutno in Poland. General von Brauchitsch personally told me, "They have fought in more than fifty battles. Every one of them is made of iron and steel. Their eyes are as bright when they go to the battlefield as they are when they march here." (End of this article)</p>

<h3>Rumors Disappear, Gold Market Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash spot black market fluctuated around 6,150 yuan. The repercussions of the rumors have subsided, but the competition between bulls and bears is still fierce. When the price fell, Qian Dui Ye and others continued to add to their positions. Generally speaking from the psychology of retail investors, the weak trend may reappear. Because the foreign exchange rate is weak and flat, there is no encouragement for buyers. It is fortunate that the closing result today rose by 15 yuan, and the operators were all overjoyed. It once dropped to 6,130 yuan in the early morning, and the highest reached 6,185 yuan. The noon closing was stable. The subsequent market trend was similar to the morning. The closing price was 6,170 yuan. The overall transaction was still strong, about 2,500 taels. The price of silver jewelry remained unchanged. The price of customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Market Surges 15 Yuan</p>
<p>The market was weak and flat in the early morning. The opening price immediately dropped by 5 yuan. The securities firm and Qian Dui Ye sold 50 taels at 6,150 yuan. Quan Yin Gold Shop and silver shops sold, and at that time, except for a certain Qian Dui Ye slightly absorbed, the rest were very weak, and the price dropped by 20 yuan. The silver shop traded 20 taels, retreating to 6,130 yuan. Qian Dui Ye's appetite gradually increased, and a certain silver shop suddenly came to search, and the gold shop turned from selling to buying, and the price rose to 6,185 yuan for the second time. However, the buying trend gradually dissipated after that. Securities firms and retail investors sold one after another, and the price fell back to 6,150 yuan before closing. Fortunately, Qian Dui Ye was still willing to maintain the price at closing, and the closing price was 6,164 yuan. The market opened 11 yuan higher in the afternoon. The gold shop traded 20 taels at 6,175 yuan. Later, because there were slightly more sellers, it immediately dropped by 10 yuan. However, Qian Dui Ye's bull position added to the absorption, and it once rose to 6,185 yuan. However, gold shops, securities firms, etc. sold at high prices, and retail investors followed suit for a while, and the trend turned soft. It was once as low as 6,145 yuan. After entering, buyers took the opportunity to buy again at low prices. At the same time, the number of sellers suddenly decreased, and the result was a closing price of 6,170 yuan, which was 15 yuan higher than the previous day's rise.

<h3>Food: Foreign Rice Still Expensive, New Rice Arrivals Quite Strong</h3>
<p>The foreign rice market is still living its black market life in the dark market, and it is being used as a bargaining chip by speculative groups. The market has long deviated from the right track, and it is swayed by people's hearts and rumors. In the early morning, the source of domestic rice arrivals increased, and there were also thousands of bags of Anhui new indica rice arriving via the Yangtze River. However, actual sales were reduced due to "yielding to the festival," and there were no changes in the domestic and foreign situation sufficient to manipulate the market as an excuse. The market price suddenly plummeted by more than one yuan as many profiteers took profits. However, after the price stabilized, it was favored by new hoarding. Large households and firms held on as before, and actual sales also slightly increased. The market gradually recovered by 70 to 80 cents to nearly one yuan. Formal transactions in the market are still only for red tip, polished tip, foreign yuan rice, and other goods that are not restricted. Other rice, such as Saigon and Siam rice, are all traded in the dark market like Du Geng. The total daily transaction volume is still 5,000 to 6,000 bags. It is reported that No. 1 aged Saigon rice is still 69 yuan, fired twist is 68 yuan, No. 2 Saigon is 65 yuan, No. 2 Siam and small twist are 63.5 yuan, 63 yuan, Tokyo stone tip is 60 yuan, 59 yuan, rice tea is high at 56 yuan, and secondary is 54 yuan.</p>
<p>Geng (rice) and domestic rice, 600 to 700 bags arrived yesterday. Both open and dark transactions, because it was initially rumored that foreign rice was weakening, and they turned lax. The sellers persisted, and they also stood firm, without much change. All were equivalent to the previous disk.</p>
<p>The source of new Geng tips is quite strong, but most of the Geng goods are accounted for, and the tips are only limited. It is estimated that more than 50 piculs of new Geng from Zhoupu, 28 dan of new Yang tips from Taicang and Jiading, and 6 dan of newly arrived Jiao Li new Du tips have been delivered, resulting in a dull sales field. Because the body is soft and difficult to maintain, its new Geng is difficult to stand, and the market is exclusively depreciated by 1.5 yuan. Opening at 73 yuan and 72.5 yuan, the new Yang tips are balanced between arrival and sales, and the original packaged goods from Taicang and Jiading are still 66.5 yuan, 66 yuan, and 64.5 yuan per peck. The Jiao Li new Du tips, first because they are fresh when they arrive, and second because there are only 6 dan, so the opening price is more elegant than the Yang tips, reaching 67.5 yuan, 67 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hoarding Wind Not Checked, Japanese Flour Re-emerges</h3>
<p>Flour, yesterday's spot flour market, was quite persistent. The Chinese flour factory's disk was still 15.5 yuan. The number of batches released by the two factories was not large. At present, the stock of inland flour is deficient. The demand for factory flour on this street is not weak, and there is often a shortage of supply. Because of the news that a certain party is not allowed to be transported into the concession, the Phoenix brand spot flour is looking forward to a good, holding a lack of opening. However, the Phoenix brand futures flour, which is emphasized by the speculative community, is even more elated, and the hoarding has not declined. The opening in October is still flat, and the price is only 15.65 yuan. Then, because the rice price is firm and stable, the hoarder absorbs it, and it gradually rises to 15.8 yuan, which is 0.13 yuan higher than the previous day. September rose from 15.35 yuan to 2.8 yuan, which is also 0.08 yuan higher than the previous day. The total number of transactions in September was only 4,000 bags, and the total number of transactions in October was 20,000 bags. The spot factory flour transaction volume in this street for retail transactions is more than 6,000 bags, and the foreign flour and inland flour transactions are all quiet. However, it is reported that the Northern Ocean Gang has added thousands of bags of leftover flour, and the price is 15.8 yuan. Also, there are 1,500 bags of flour going to Weihaiwei today.</p>
<p>Wheat, yesterday's market situation was still dull. Inland goods were suspended due to the transportation stop, and transportation was blocked. The Chinese factory did not have a good appetite because it was scheduled for foreign wheat to arrive. Japanese factories specialize in choosing cleverness. It is heard that the goods sent to the factory are 2,000 to 3,000 bags every day, all of which are received by the Sanxin factory, and the price is still around 21 yuan. Chinese factories need to add more than 3 yuan to the purchase price, and only receive 200 to 300 bags of goods.</p>
<h3>Securities: News Confusing, Bond Market Rises and Falls Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's securities dark market trend was like rabbits rising and hawks falling, with sudden rises caused by rumors of the successful new loan, and sudden falls because the news was not believed by a part of the people, resulting in bulls still coming out. The so-called events have reasons, and the investigation has no basis. However, regarding this news, the opinion of the financial community is that the events do have reasons, but the factual basis does not seem to be mature, and is probably still brewing. Therefore, public bonds are not greatly stimulated, and most of the market is still optimistic. The sudden rise and fall is still a part of the floating profit settlement, so the market price is not seen to be small. Because of the special relationship with customers, Dingzhong must sell, so it can only suppress the price to sell. This has nothing to do with the overall trend of public bonds. Once the loan is confirmed, the rise will be even greater than before. This level should not be ignored. Yesterday's experience, the morning rise was very strong, and C-type once reached 6.3 yuan, which was 1 yuan higher than the next day. This is related to the general trust in the loan. Later, because the gold market was quiet as usual, there was no counter-evidence of a sharp drop, which caused many parties to doubt, and the floating profit fell back with the market. The market trend was in rotation in the afternoon, and people's minds were different. There were still many spills in the afternoon, and the market price of Dingzhong was only 3 yuan, with 50,000 transactions, and it was immediately sold off, which shows that the market appetite and digestion ability are still very strong. Although the future looks like a rotation, the number of people who are still bullish is still in the majority. As a result of the market price, except for the C and E types that did not have a high or low, the A and B types still rose by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan, and the Ding type fell sharply by 0.7 yuan, which should be an exception. The total number of transactions was about 1.2 to 1.3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading, 50 shares of Zhongxing Coal Mine Company were traded at a price of 113 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, the Public Industry Association reported that the stock market trend is very unstable, and the selling wind is expanding at any time. Fortunately, most of them were absorbed by the people who made up the short position. When the price was too low, there were still investors who took the opportunity to collect cheap. Although the weekend holiday is very long, the transaction volume is extremely large, indicating that the market's confidence is not lacking. If the news does not deteriorate, this belief will be more fully expressed. Rubber stocks fell sharply, while industrial stocks changed little.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Futures Yarn Has Selling Short</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a revolving environment. This is because the sales are not smooth and the foreign exchange is also calm. Therefore, although the bulls are looking at the rise, the environment does not allow it. According to this, the market should have a downward trend. However, households with general economic sufficiency are tightening and still do not give up. For a while, the chips are closed and not loosened. However, some futures are inclined to sell short, because the inventory is increasing day by day, and the sales channels are becoming narrower, so there are quite a few people who sell at high prices. The spot yarn is opened in the morning, and the popularity is still good, because the news is slightly better, and 20 count, Horse price is 973 yuan, and it immediately fell to 965 yuan. Later, the general scalpers re-activated and dragged them in one after another. The market was filled with buying, but in fact, there were not many actual buyers, and most of them were making a comeback. It rose to 979 yuan, but it was tight and expensive after the closing. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 2,943 packages were traded. The 20 count Double Horse market fell by 4 yuan. Today, 260 pieces of cotton yarn are shipped to Siam. The amount of each gang's purchase is listed on the left,</p>
<h3>New Cotton from Jiangsu and Zhejiang is Good, But How Can It Be Shipped Out?</h3>
<p>The situation of spot cotton is very stagnant. The new cotton from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is in good condition, but the procedures for obtaining and transporting the certificate are very difficult, and it cannot be shipped out. Cotton merchants have to sit idly by. The foreign cotton purchased in the past is still sufficient, but the factory is reluctant to purchase raw materials because of the future of the yarn market, which is not very hopeful. Therefore, it has also created an awkward situation.</p>
<p>According to another report, the market price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market is calm. Later, due to the good demand for spot goods, and the partial short covering, the closing price was higher than the previous day by 1 or 2 pound notes. The Indian market situation is flat, and the forecast is up by half a rupee.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been very quiet in recent days. All parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude because the political news is unpredictable. However, the market inventory is not abundant, and the cotton price will not fall again, because the same industry buys new cotton, and the foreign firms need to pay first and then load, and the risk is huge, so there are very few orders, so the existing inventory is planned to wait for a good price to sell in the future.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Slightly Decreases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market turned soft. The association divided the plate, and the local storage goods for two or four rough white sugars were 78 yuan, the new foreign storage goods were 78.6 yuan, small 0.2 yuan, and June arrival was 78 yuan. The old goods in April were slightly oily, 76 yuan, and the transit goods were 62.8 yuan. Dutch cotton white KD 74 yuan, 唛 63 yuan, 唛 were all 62 yuan. Taitoo B唛 16.8 yuan, and later 76.5 yuan, 0.4 yuan less than the previous day DY 73.5 yuan, unchanged, HX 73.5 yuan, the road goods are 73.25 yuan,</p>
<h3>Seafood: A New Batch of Siamese Light Sea Cucumber Arrives</h3>
<p>Siamese light sea cucumber, due to the scarcity of arrivals, the market has gradually felt a lack. It has been a long time since the large size of goods was out of stock. Only a new batch arrived the day before yesterday, and it has already been sold, and the price is 205 yuan. Medium light is still 190 yuan, and the trend is very strong.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods New Peach Meat Bumper Harvest, Prices Plummet by Forty Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, new peach meat has been arriving continuously. This year's harvest is relatively abundant, so the opening price has gradually decreased. It is noted that the previous price had dropped to 235 yuan, but yesterday it plummeted by more than 20 yuan, settling at 180 yuan per lot. The total price decrease has reached 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal White Coal Dust Sells Well</h3>
<p>Although new shipments of Hongji white coal dust have been arriving continuously recently, shops and coal briquette factories in this street are actively procuring, searching everywhere. The market has a trend of selling goods as soon as they arrive. The market price for Hongji No. 1 dust has already been quoted at 118 yuan in unofficial transactions, and there is still demand. Transferring goods at the dock is 3 yuan cheaper per lot, with water transportation and rickshaw expenses to be borne by the customer.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials Fennel Production Price Exceeds Shanghai Market by 30-40 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the increased cost of Hong Kong exchange affecting fennel, according to a recent letter, the quoted price must exceed the Shanghai market by 30-40 yuan. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to agree on a price, resulting in a lack of arrivals. The quoted price is around 120 yuan, but no transactions have been made yet.</p>
<h3>Grains Broad Beans Rise Sharply Influenced by High Rice and Grain Prices, Leading to Speculators' Appetite</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was weak due to slightly fewer sources, and demand was not strong. However, broad beans suddenly rose sharply. This rising trend is entirely influenced by the soaring rice and grain prices, stimulating speculators' appetite, resulting in a prosperous situation for goods with low arrivals and inventory. Yesterday, Wu Jiang picked broad beans opened at 24 yuan, with one cart traded, and two carts of common goods were priced at 21.8 to 22 yuan. Over 140 bags of Qing broad beans from Maojia City in Beigang were priced at 11 yuan. Over 100 bags of Qing broad beans from Minhang in Nangang were priced at 19.75 yuan. 300-400 bags of Jiading white broad beans were priced at 21.4 yuan. Over 300 bags of Chongming sand broad beans were priced at 18.5 to 19 yuan. 500 bags of small-grain white broad beans from Wuhu were priced at 17.7 to 18 yuan.</p>
<p>Today, there are four cans of raw oil being shipped to Little Luzon, and another 500 bags of corn being shipped to Weihaiwei.</p>
<h3>Hardware Tinplate Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Due to the egg factories' ineffective procurement, some merchants from the north have been searching for tinplate recently. Some factories in this street have also been buying in small quantities. The inventory of this product in this port is not abundant, and the overseas supply is insufficient (because foreign pricing is higher than Shanghai market prices). Therefore, holders of the goods are thinking of increasing the standard trading price. It is noted that the market quotation yesterday was 210 yuan per box (containing 112 sheets) for 108-pound Italian goods, 240 yuan for American goods, 240 yuan for 200-pound Italian goods, and 280 yuan for 200-pound standard American goods.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Judicial Dignity, Making a Pure Statement, Lawful Officials Enforce Fixed Laws, Impartial Judgment Without Political Bias, Judge of the First Special Court Speaks with Western Reporter Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the incident of officials and translators of the First Special District Court receiving threatening letters, a responsible official of the First Special Court clarified the position to a reporter from the English-language "Da Mei Evening News" yesterday morning (September 13th), stating that they were appointed as officials of the Special Court by the legal Chinese government recognized by the signatory countries of the 1927 Court Agreement, responsible for enforcing the fixed laws of Chinese criminal law and not other laws.</p>
<p>Handling Cases, Striving for Fairness</p>
<p>Regarding all suspects and criminals, we will try our best not to show bias. We will never change the laws formulated by the Chinese government, nor do we intend to do so. Regarding the threatening letters, there is nothing to say, because we ourselves are enforcers of the laws formulated by the legal government.</p>
<p>Newly Promulgated Laws are Generally Invalid</p>
<p>The government of any country is subject to change. If there is a change in the Chinese government, there is no difference in its legal execution history of criminal law. However, it is completely different if the new government has not been recognized as the legal organ representing the people. The new laws it promulgates are generally invalid, and the legally appointed executive will never implement these new laws.</p>
<p>Continuing to Follow the National Government's Laws</p>
<p>We are appointed as court officials by the Chongqing National Government to maintain law and order in the Shanghai Special District. Our duty is to follow the laws formulated by the legal Chinese government recognized by all. This is what we are determined to continue to implement. We will not ask about laws set by other parties.</p>
<p>Threats and Intimidation are Not a Concern</p>
<p>If any appointed official disagrees with this view, it is due to their personal viewpoint. However, the legal government will never recognize it. Therefore, those with this point of view will be dismissed immediately. The responsibility of each judge is to implement the laws in the Chinese criminal law formulated by the legal government. We should ignore all the threats we have received in the past and present.</p>
<p>No Political Bias</p>
<p>Because we judge according to the law, we have no political bias, and it is our responsibility to judge criminals fairly and impartially. Each judge holds this belief, so they should continue to carry out the work we believe is fair. It is reported that every morning, when the judges go to the court, the Public Works Department Police Department dispatches special cars for pick-up and drop-off, and there are police officers with submachine guns and pistols accompanying the car for strict defense.</p>
<p>Japanese Judicial Officers Visit the Court</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, eight or nine Japanese people, riding in three cars, arrived one after another at the gate of the First Special District Local Court of Jiangsu Seven Seas at 870 Weihaiwei Road. At the same time, Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Department's Legal Group, also rushed to the scene by car. He then got out of the car and led the group of Japanese into the court. The gate guards and detectives of the patrol room, seeing that the group of Japanese was led by lawyer Li, did not stop them. The group of Japanese, led by lawyer Li, visited the first, second, and third civil courts before leaving by car. The group of Japanese were Japanese prosecutors and other judicial personnel. With the prior consent of the Public Works Department, lawyer Li accompanied them on the visit. When the Japanese judicial personnel visited the Special Court, the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room heard the news and immediately sent senior police officers to the court to inquire about the truth before driving away.</p>
<h3>Miura Yoshiaki Scheduled to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai was replaced by Kanegoro Horiuchi, Director of the East Asia Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the current Consul General, Yoshiaki Miura, was also announced by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 12th to be transferred to the position of Minister to Mexico. After receiving the order, Miura has scheduled to leave Shanghai for Japan by ship on the 26th of this month. After a short stay, he will go to Mexico to take office. He has been busy handling handover matters these days.</p>
<p>The Story of Fu and Horiuchi Changing to Ambassadors</p>
<p>Also, Horiuchi Kanegoro, who was recently sent to Shanghai as Consul, is a well-known China expert. He graduated from the Shanghai Tongwen College and returned to China to improve his university and study law. He originally served as the Director of the East Asia Section of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. After Konoe Shigeru revisited his old tricks and made major changes to diplomatic personnel, he was sent to Shanghai as Consul General and Counselor of the Embassy. Recently, it was heard that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made a third change in personnel, specially appointing Horiuchi Kanegoro as Minister Plenipotentiary. From this, it can be seen that Japan's diplomatic policy is uncertain.</p>
<h3>Cosme Has No Preparation to Leave Shanghai Yet</h3>
<p>There have been rumors that French Ambassador Cosme will soon leave Shanghai for Chongqing. According to a reporter from Pingming News Agency, French Ambassador Cosme has not yet made preparations to leave Shanghai. However, French Consul General Auchi is determined to leave Shanghai before the French Ambassador leaves.</p>
<h3>Schedule for Foreign Vessels to Sail for Defense</h3>
<p>The requisition of Jardine Matheson's four ships, Yisheng, Yongsheng, Desheng, and Haosheng, when British troops withdrew from China has been completed in Singapore. They have successively returned to Hong Kong for resumption of sailing. The details have been reported. Now, the Yongsheng ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai today and is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Hong Kong for defense on the 19th. The Yisheng ship is expected to arrive on the 16th, and the sailing schedule has not yet been announced. The Taisheng ship will also return to Shanghai from Tianjin and Yantai on the 16th and is expected to sail from Shanghai for defense and to Hong Kong Bay on the 18th. It is heard that the Desheng ship will sail directly from Singapore to Saigon to transport rice to Shanghai before coming to Shanghai. The Haosheng ship is still on its way back to Shanghai, and news is scarce.</p>
<p>Rice Transport is Smooth</p>
<p>The Taikoo Steam Navigation Company's Ninghai ship completed loading at the Bund Wharf in the French Concession yesterday and is scheduled to set sail for Siam to transfer to Little Luzon this morning. The Jiaying ship is scheduled to sail on the 22nd. The company's Xinjiang ship is scheduled to sail to Saigon and other places on the 19th. The French Shipping Company's Xijiang ship will return to Shanghai in the middle of next month. The ships sailing to Saigon and Siam will carry large quantities of rice to Shanghai. Ships sailing to Haiphong also carry foreign rice to Shanghai. Therefore, there should be no problem with the source of foreign rice in this port.</p>
<h3>Unsuccessful in Suppressing Rice Prices, Evaluation Committee Accepts Blame, The Question of Whether the Committee Should Exist, Please Ask the Concession Authorities for Instructions, Two Members of the Evaluation Committee Have Sent Letters of Resignation</h3>
<p>Previously, various rice industry groups in this city, following the instructions of the two Concession authorities and adapting to the factual needs, organized a Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee. Based on the production price of foreign rice, plus the reasonable profits of rice merchants, the committee would evaluate the highest price of foreign rice every Tuesday and Friday to prevent market manipulation and speculation. The committee has been established for more than two months. Recently, due to the tense situation in Vietnam, speculators are manipulating the market price. Although the committee held meetings on schedule as usual to discuss ways to suppress rice prices, it was difficult to achieve effective results, and the black market prevailed, making the price limit a mere formality. Yesterday, the committee held its eighth regular meeting. All the committee members and representatives from the two Concession municipal chambers of commerce attended the meeting. After a long discussion, it was still difficult to obtain concrete and effective measures to crack down on the black market and suppress rice prices. Under this bad environment, it was generally believed that it was necessary to send a letter to the Concession authorities asking for instructions.</p>
<p>Resolution Situation</p>
<p>The resolution stated, "This committee, considering the livelihoods of the common people, firmly maintains the evaluated price of the 3rd of this month. However, the black market has been prevailing in recent days, and the evaluation is tantamount to a mere formality. This committee has exhausted its efforts, and after repeated deliberations, there is no proper solution. Under these circumstances, whether this committee should continue to exist has actually become a problem. We have no choice but to report the difficulties and the production prices reported by various foreign firms in a letter to the two Concession authorities to ask for instructions so as to comply with them." It is also heard that the next meeting will not be held until the authorities have instructed them. Then, the responsibility of the authorities is even more significant, and there may be a day when the authorities will enforce rice prices and open the warehouses publicly. It is heard that at yesterday's meeting, Chairman Zhu Zixiang suggested two points to the conference: (1) Send a letter to the two Concession authorities to ask them to transfer the foreign rice of 100,000 bags that Yu Qiaqing has ordered to be transported to Shanghai for the purpose of cheap rice sales to Ningbo, and temporarily supply it to the market in order to stabilize people's hearts and increase spot goods in the market. (2) Send another letter to the Bean and Rice Grain Guild, urging member businesses to continue to subscribe for foreign rice at this time of food panic to ensure sufficient food for the people and to maintain a sufficient reserve.</p>
<p>Consultation on Collective Purchase</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee convened its sixth meeting of evaluation committee members on the 7th of this month. It was generally believed that in order to suppress rice prices, it was first necessary to increase the reserve of rice and grain and to crack down on the black market. As a result of the discussion, letters were sent to the two Concession authorities and the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, inviting representatives of various industries to advise and encourage the purchase of foreign rice on a specific date. The letters were delivered by a special messenger from the committee the next day. Now, a reply has been received from the authorities stating that they strongly agree with the collective ordering of foreign rice and have decided to invite representatives from various industries to consult on specific methods to promote its realization. They also stated that they will strictly enforce their powers to the best of their ability to crack down on the black market and assist in stabilizing the entire rice market. It is also learned that the rice industry is actively engaged in collective rice purchases. Zhang Nianxuan and Qu Zhenhua have sent letters of resignation from the Evaluation Committee.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Police Power Agreement Expected to be Established by the End of the Month, The Public Works Department's Reply Documents Can Be Issued Within Days</h3>
<p>A senior official told a Western reporter yesterday morning (September 13th) that the final agreement on the "Joint Police Power" issue in the road-building area beyond the boundary between the Public Works Department and Fu Xiaoan is about to be established. The Public Works Department's reply to Fu Xiaoan can be issued soon. It is generally expected that the problem can be completely resolved before the end of this month.</p>
<p>According to another source, Major Bowman, Chief Inspector of the Public Works Department Police Department, told a Western reporter yesterday that although there is a possibility that the "Joint Police Power" issue in the road-building area beyond the boundary will be resolved before the end of this month, it is feared that this will not be the case. Bowman said that all the work on the issue may not be completed within six weeks, let alone one week. But he said that the final agreement may be established by the beginning of November. It is heard that the Public Works Department's reply to Fu Xiaoan is expected to be issued within the next week.</p>
<h3>US Flagship Augusta to Sail to Shanghai Within Days</h3>
<p>Luzon Leaves Shanghai to the West</p>
<p>The US Yangtze River Command Ship Luzon suddenly sailed out of the Wusongkou from Shanghai on the 12th. It returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. It is generally believed that it sailed to Wuhu in the Yangtze River Basin. All the US ships docked in Shanghai have left. However, the Asian Fleet Minesweeper Oriole arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao yesterday morning. It is heard that Admiral Hepburn's flagship Augusta will also come to Shanghai from North China before next Monday.</p>
<h3>Rewarding the Internal Transfer of Floating Capital, The National Government Guarantees Interest</h3>
<p>In order to encourage the outflow of floating capital from Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance ordered the silver and money industry to absorb deposits in Shanghai and give them generous interest. And transfer its funds to the mainland, and the interest obtained will be specially allowed to be withdrawn in Shanghai, and organize a silver group to gather capital and directly invest in profitable industries in the mainland. If there are losses or the dividends are insufficient to cover the official interest, the government will compensate. The details have been seen in previous reports. At present, the reason why floating capital in Shanghai is unwilling to flow inward is actually because the speculative profits are particularly high. Now, watching the changes in the speculative market in Shanghai confirms the unreliability of "speculative safety". Speculators have made it clear that there is a risk of stirring up trouble. Moreover, the world situation is changing unpredictably, and all countries have the possibility of getting involved in the vortex of war. The trend of speculation will inevitably gradually subside in the future. Holders of capital have already taken the level of interest as the only standard for placing funds.</p>
<h3>Major Real Estate: Exports Surge, Reaching 60 Million Yuan Annually; Northwest Freight Smooth</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Nationalist Government has been making every effort to encourage the export of various major domestic products to earn foreign exchange and replenish war funds. According to statistics released by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, major domestic products sold overseas under government control, such as silk, tea, tung oil, bristles, pig iron, antimony, and tin, have reached 60 million yuan annually. Although freight in Vietnam has been obstructed recently, exports via the Northwest international route are still very smooth. This shows that the government's policy of encouraging the export of domestic products has achieved significant results and is expected to continue to progress. According to a report from the Chinese Maritime Customs, the total value of exports in the first six months of this year has more than doubled compared to the same period last year. The export value for the same period last year was 411,610,262 yuan, while the first six months of this year have increased to 934,585,151 yuan, which also proves the increasing export of various major domestic products.</p>
<h3>Advocating Savings on Mid-Autumn Festival Feast Expenses; Donating to Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Yuzhai, the manager of the Huizhong Bank in this city, recently, in view of the widespread famine and cries for food, and the fact that the small citizens of Shanghai cannot support themselves, although price stabilization associations and civil food regulation associations have been established, the future is long and the rice shortage has not ended. The more funds for price stabilization, the better. Therefore, he saved 100 yuan from the Mid-Autumn Festival feast expenses of the Huizhong Bank's head office and branches and donated it to price stabilization. He also asked the old leaders of the two places to promote this. As soon as the call is made, everyone will respond. Briefly, at this time when natural disasters and man-made calamities are coming one after another, I grieve for our people, whose faces are all pale.</p>
<p>Autumn gives way to Winter in a flash.</p>
<p>The north wind is biting, and the padded clothing is not warm. Millions of civilians in this city are about to cry out in hunger and cold, with no way to call for help. We, under the protection of Heaven, are spared the worry of freezing and starvation. We should encourage ourselves, save on clothing and food, to seek peace of mind. It is a question of round heads and square feet, of the same race and culture. The rich enjoy delicacies and do not bother to eat them, and have light furs and warm hats and still complain that they are not warm enough. The poor have empty stomachs, clutching their bellies and picking at their hearts, wearing tattered clothes and crying in the streets. Is there such a disparity in the injustices of Heaven? Now, the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching,</p>
<p>Reunion and Moon Viewing.</p>
<p>Customs are passed down and unbreakable. Public offices and shops indulge in extravagance, and a feast costs hundreds of gold. The cost of a mooncake is several tens. As the saying goes, "A rich family's feast is a poor man's food for half a year." I ask, on this night of joy, when the wine is warm and the ears are hot, do you also think of the white bones along the road and the compatriots with dark faces and withered appearances? Those with even a little heart will surely stop drinking and weep bitterly, covering their faces and shedding tears. What joy is there to speak of? Yuzhai is falsely listed as a member of the price stabilization association and should</p>
<p>Lead by Example.</p>
<p>Therefore, I saved 100 yuan from the Huizhong Mid-Autumn Festival feast expenses and donated it to price stabilization funds. I know that the well is deep and the rope is short, and my ability is clumsy but my heart is long. This small amount may be ridiculed by the rich, but I hope everyone will think the same and every family will see the same. Then, there are tens of thousands of wealthy families and prosperous shops in this city. If everyone can use this as a starting point, then accumulating little makes a lot, and the results will be considerable. This will not disappoint Yuzhai's painstaking efforts to advocate.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Wharf: Dredging Project Begins</h3>
<p>The Weisfu Wharf on the Bund of the French Concession has been in disrepair for many years, and the accumulation of silt has greatly hindered the berthing of ships. The Weilihan Company has leased a small dredger to carry out dredging work at the wharf, which began yesterday and is expected to be completed within a month. The dredger can dig 100 cubic meters of silt per day. It is reported that the berthing of ships will not be hindered during the dredging period.</p>
<h3>Settlement of Labor Dispute of French Concession Night Soil Workers: Five Conditions</h3>
<p>After many days of stalemate in the labor dispute of the night soil workers in the French Concession, both labor and management reached a satisfactory conclusion through negotiation. All 700 workers resumed work at 3 a.m. the day before yesterday, and the accumulated night soil in the alleys was cleared. A reporter learned from Ma Hongji on Malang Road yesterday that the conditions agreed upon by both parties are as follows: (1) All workers will receive a uniform raise of 4.5 yuan per month. (2) The employer must provide each night soil worker with a rain hat every year. (3) If a night soil worker becomes ill and seeks medical treatment at the French Concession Health Bureau, they will be exempt from the registration fee to reduce the burden. (4) If a night soil worker sells night soil privately, they will be immediately dismissed. (5) These conditions are temporary in nature and shall not be permanently valid. The labor's request for the employer to issue a subsidy of 400 yuan to the union each year was not established.</p>
<h3>Family Bread Price: Up 3 Cents Per Pound</h3>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions, in order to improve the people's food problem, agreed with various bread companies to bake a kind of "family bread," with a retail price of 38 cents per pound. It has been sold for several months. Recently, the bread companies believe that the exchange rate is falling, and the cost of various materials has increased. Therefore, they requested to raise the selling price of the bread to 41 cents per pound, which has been tentatively approved by the authorities of the two concessions. However, once the market improves, the regulations will be revised.</p>
<h3>Defense Zone Issue: Not Resolved by Shanghai; Will Be Decided by U.S. and Japanese Governments in Consultation; Shanghai and U.S. Authorities Held Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Although the U.S. official in this port denied holding a meeting yesterday morning (13th), it is learned that the commander of the U.S. Navy Yangtze River Fleet, Glassford, the U.S. Acting Consul General, Butler, and the commander of the U.S. Marine 4th Regiment, Colonel Baker, did hold a meeting at the U.S. Consulate General for an hour and a half on the morning of the day before yesterday (12th) at 10 a.m. According to the last time the Commander of the U.S. Navy Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Hurd, visited Shanghai, he held several meetings. Although the details of the previous meetings have not been published to this day, it is generally believed that the content of the talks is mostly about the defense zone issue caused by the British troops withdrawing from this port. Local officials still believe that the final solution to the issue of the defense zone previously managed by the British troops is being studied by the U.S. and Japanese authorities. The final decision will be made by the governments of the two countries, not by the local authorities here.</p>

<h3>North China Visitor Recounts: Foreigners Suffer Great Hardship; Foreign Goods Effectively Prohibited; North China People's Spirit is Resilient and Extraordinary</h3>
<p>A gentleman who recently arrived in Shanghai from North China told a Western newspaper reporter that although foreigners in Peiping (Beijing) have been subjected to heavy restrictions and disturbances by the Japanese in North China, and it is clear that the Japanese are forcing foreign nationals to cease business in order to monopolize all commerce there, the foreigners are still making every effort to maintain their trade.</p>
<p>Restrictions on Foreign Businesses: Increasingly Strict</p>
<p>Peiping, the ancient capital, has seen a sharp decline in commerce since being controlled by the Japanese. Restrictions on foreign businesses have intensified, leading to near-shutdown of operations. For example, the Japanese side has recently imposed a restriction on foreign trade, prohibiting foreign firms from importing goods worth more than 50 yuan from the three northeastern provinces (Manchuria), and limiting exports to 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Goods Effectively Prohibited</p>
<p>Moreover, the recently promulgated currency regulations have effectively prohibited the import of foreign goods. Peiping's main business, the antique trade, has also declined. Furthermore, imports of overseas-made automobiles have recently stopped. However, foreign tobacco companies have not been severely affected, and American and British cigarettes are still sold. In recent times, many Germans have arrived in Peiping. However, their trade with Italian expatriates is also hampered by restrictions. The arrival of a large number of Germans in Peiping has prompted questions as to why they are going there, but no one can answer it.</p>
<p>The People of Peiping: Striving for Self-Improvement</p>
<p>The people of Peiping endure various difficulties and are quite capable of striving for self-improvement. Even during the famine, they can endure hardship and resentment. They seem to turn a deaf ear to Japanese propaganda. However, they therefore know little about the situation in Europe and China. All residents of Peiping are monitored by the Japanese military police, and are constantly summoned to the headquarters to be closely questioned about their activities and relationships with other Chinese. The Chinese are not allowed to listen to any broadcasts other than those that are purely Japanese propaganda.</p>
<p>Chinese Guerrillas: Fully Active</p>
<p>Throughout the Peiping area, guerrillas are constantly active. Some people feel that the strength of the guerrillas in the area is so strong that it would not be difficult for the Eighth Route Army to seize Peiping. The Japanese propaganda that the guerrillas are undisciplined "bandits" is sheer slander. The guerrillas are well-organized and have repeatedly inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army and transportation.</p>
<p>Train Wrecks: Abandoned Beside the Railroad</p>
<p>Only a few Japanese soldiers are posted around Peiping during the day. At night, there are no traces of Japanese sentries, for fear of being captured by guerrillas at night. Fortifications have been built around the stations of the Peiping-Tientsin (Tianjin) Railway to prevent attacks by the Chinese army. There are many trains that have been destroyed, and their wreckage is often seen abandoned beside the railroad.</p>
<p>Anti-Foreign Movement: Bound to Fail</p>
<p>The Japanese are trying to incite the Chinese to carry out an anti-foreign movement, but the people are not interested in this. The so-called "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere" is bound to fail in North China. It cannot be denied that the Japanese army in North China has deep trenches and high walls, and is well protected. The guerrillas alone cannot drive them out of the country.</p>
<h3>Xiangshan, Yongjia, and Ningbo: Bombed One After Another</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Association of Zhejiang Province natives yesterday received a telegram from eastern Zhejiang as follows: At 12:25 noon on the 11th, two Japanese planes were spotted over Guanhaiwei. The Ningbo air defense post issued an air raid alert. Subsequently, the Japanese planes passed Longshan, invaded the airspace over Xiangshan through Chuanshan in Zhenhai, and dropped a bomb, which landed in the city, destroying ten houses, seriously injuring two civilians, and slightly injuring four others. After the planes wreaked havoc, they entered the airspace over Haimen through Shipu and circled, and then flew to Yongjia, dropping ten bombs, including two incendiary bombs. The city immediately burst into flames. After dropping bombs in Yongjia, they then rushed to Ruian and dropped three bombs. Afterwards, they passed through Huangyan, Ninghai, Fenghua, passed Zhenhai, Longshan, and fled out to sea. The alarm was lifted at 1:46 p.m. At 4:03 p.m., Ningbo issued another alert. Two Japanese planes were spotted in Haimen. At 4:15 p.m., the Japanese planes appeared to be attacking Ningbo, so an emergency alert was issued. Subsequently, the Japanese planes did invade the airspace over Ningbo city and circled twice, dropping 100-pound and 200-pound bombs, which landed in the rice paddies of the Sixth Bao of Yongnan Township, Mo × Zhuang. Fortunately, there were no casualties or losses. After dropping the bombs, they fled towards Longshan. The alarm was lifted at 4:40 p.m. Also, at 6:10 a.m. on the 12th, a Japanese warship on the waters of Shipu suddenly fired four shells towards the coast. The shells landed in the mud, and fortunately there were no losses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai British Community Relief for London Victims</h3>
<p>Allocating 2,500 Pounds; All Remittances Sent to England, Including Donations</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Shanghai British Community Central War Fund Committee, in view of the repeated bombings of London and the fact that there must be many citizens displaced and suffering, began fundraising this morning (13th) to be delivered to the Lord Mayor of London's Fund for relief purposes, and decided to first allocate 2,500 pounds from its existing deposits, together with all the funds raised from the 10th to the 30th of this month, to be remitted to the Lord Mayor of London's Fund. Red Cross boxes have been placed in the halls of major British hotels in this city, and the donations received have been considerable.</p>
<h3>Wang Songfen Donates Feast Expenses to Aid</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Songfen, manager of the Wang Dasheng store at the intersection of Xiaodongmen and Minguo Road, is donating 400 yuan from his 80th birthday feast expenses to aid refugees, to bring benefits to his relatives and friends, divided among the Relief Association, the Epidemic Hospital, the Pushan Villa, and the Jingjiang Guildhall. However, the funds for Jingjiang will be used solely for Jianbi Township, as it is Wang's hometown.</p>
<h3>Farewell Ceremony for Mr. Ge Bo by Staff of the Shanghai Municipal Council for his Return to His Country to Join the Army; Praising Ge Bo as Highly Respected by Colleagues</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that Mr. Fei Hepu, Director-General and CEO of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the staff of the Director-General's office, gathered in the Council's meeting room yesterday morning (12th) to bid farewell to Mr. Ge Bo, the Deputy Director-General of the Council, who resigned to join the army, and presented him with a silver gift on behalf of the Director-General's office. Several people raised their glasses to toast and bless Ge Bo, praising his high respect among colleagues, and expressing their deep regret for his imminent departure. Ge Bo replied, expressing his hope to return to Shanghai one day and reunite with his old friends. According to reports, Ge Bo has served in the Shanghai Municipal Council for four years and has recently resigned. He is scheduled to complete the handover on the 14th and then go to Malaya to join the British army.</p>
<h3>Saving Mid-Autumn Festival Expenses; Offering Funds to Relieve Distress; Promoting the Country's Future; Respecting the Lives of Refugees</h3>
<p>As the Mid-Autumn Festival approaches, residents everywhere, in accordance with past customs, will celebrate the "Festival" in a grand manner on this day. The amount consumed each year is considerable. In view of this, the Festival Saving Movement Committee of this city specially appealed to all sectors yesterday to recognize the times and empathize with the country's difficulties. In the past peaceful times, it was permissible to decorate the season. However, at this time when the country's steps are difficult, and millions of soldiers are fighting bloody battles, and Japanese planes are wreaking havoc, and tens of millions of refugees are crying for food, continuing to hold celebrations as usual is tantamount to abandoning the duties of a citizen. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that all enthusiastic compatriots will completely transfer the unnecessary consumption of the Mid-Autumn Festival to the National Government to be used as consolation funds, or donate to refugees to meet their needs for living materials. The country's future and the lives of refugees all depend on it. It is reported that the Refugee Relief Association Citizen Group Fundraising Committee and the Refugee Children's Home have also issued proclamations, urging all sectors to save on festival expenses and donate to relieve refugees and refugee children.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Conspires with Kidnappers; Kidnaps Zipper Factory Owner; Li Wenbin Escapes from the Bandit's Den and Reports to the Police; Eight Accomplices Arrested; Confessions Obtained Pending Judgment</h3>
<p>Li Wenbin, the owner of the Huaxing Zipper Factory on Kaifeng Road and a native of Shaoxing, lives at No. 48, Duofu Lane, Fuxu Road, and has many concubines. At 11:30 p.m. on the 29th of last month, Li was returning home in his private car from No. 111, Limei Road, the residence of his fourth concubine, when he was abducted by several kidnappers just as he arrived at the entrance of the lane. He was held for ransom behind the Zhaofeng Garden at the end of Yuyuan Road, guarded by a Mr. Zhu. Li persuaded Zhu with his eloquent tongue, and Zhu and Li escaped together on the 9th of this month. Li immediately reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station. After questioning Zhu, the detectives learned that during a joint meeting of the kidnappers, a long-legged, hunchbacked man with a northern accent participated. The man said that Li had hundreds of thousands of assets, and that after Li was kidnapped, he had agreed to a ransom of 20,000 yuan. However, the man said that Li was really rich and that they had to get 100,000 or 80,000 yuan from him. He also said that a Mr. Yu living in the same lane was also quite wealthy and that they planned to kidnap him as well. After careful consideration, Li realized that the description of the man given by Zhu was the same as that of Wei Yushan, a Tianjin native and gatekeeper of Duofu Lane, badge number 2459. The police detectives then arrested Wei and found a yellow uniform. The number on the epaulette was 2495, with the last two digits deliberately reversed. Zhu then pointed out Wei in the police station from among eight people, saying that he had seen him at the meeting and on the 3rd of this month. However, Wei firmly denied it, saying that he had worn the yellow uniform to gamble at the Lisheng gambling table on September 3rd. However, after investigation by the detectives, the Lisheng gambling table had been closed before September 3rd, which was obviously inconsistent with Wei's statement. Therefore, the police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit against him for the crime of kidnapping and extortion. Liu Yugui, the judge, opened the second criminal court yesterday morning for interrogation. The plaintiff, Li Wenbin, stated that he had been robbed of 270 yuan in legal tender and a one-and-a-half carat diamond ring worth 3,000 yuan when he was kidnapped, so he retained lawyer Wu Peng to file a civil lawsuit as well. After Judge Liu questioned the defendant, he still firmly denied it. Subsequently, the court appointed lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend the defendant. The court then declared the debate closed and scheduled sentencing for Friday morning next week.</p>
<h3>Employees of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank Arrested</h3>
<p>At around 3 p.m. yesterday, one or two Japanese suddenly went to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road, accompanied by police detectives, and arrested three employees. They are currently being held at the police station's political department.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Wearing Diamond Ring Robbed and Shot</h3>
<p>At around 9 p.m. last night, a fashionable young woman wearing a diamond ring was walking along Kangnao Road and Yanping Road when she was suddenly confronted by three robbers who threatened her with guns. One of the robbers tried to rob her of the diamond ring on her hand. The woman resisted and shouted for the police, which angered the robbers, who shot the woman in the head. The bullet hit her temple, and she died on the spot. After investigation, it was learned that the young woman was Dai Qiao, the daughter-in-law of Dai Buxiang, the manager of the Dachina Hotel, and was 23 years old.</p>
<h3>Young Girl and Elder Sister Commit Suicide by Poison One After Another</h3>
<p>A young girl surnamed Zeng from Liaoning, 16 years old, who lives at No. 84, Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, in western Shanghai, and studies at Peicheng Girls' School on Xiaoshadu Road, took a liquid poison to commit suicide behind her back at around 9 p.m. last night for unknown reasons. Her family discovered her at around 10 p.m. and rushed her to the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road for treatment. It is said that she was severely poisoned and her life may be in danger. Zeng's family discovered her elder sister, Huang Xiaohong (a 20-year-old native of Liaoning), also swallowed the same poison to commit suicide at 12 a.m. that night, and sent her to the Red Cross Hospital. It is said that she was lightly poisoned.</p>
<h3>Heartless Brothel Owner; Abandons Corpse</h3>
<p>A brothel owner named Lu Chen runs a clandestine prostitution business in room 222 of the Jisheng Inn at No. 10, Lane 195, Fujian Road. She adopted an eight-year-old girl named Lu Yuxian, who suddenly died on the 8th of this month. The owner did not prepare a coffin for her burial, and instead conspired with Shi Wenxue (45 years old, from Yangzhou), a tea server at the inn, and Lu Miaosheng (51 years old, from Pudong), a police officer, to abandon the corpse at the intersection of Fujian Road and Fuzhou Road at 8 a.m. one morning, leaving it exposed. After being discovered by a patrol officer, the Old Gate Police Station was reported. The Western police chief Fang Te'er, Hua Liang, Zhang Xingyan, and Hua Erdao Tou, after a lengthy investigation, finally learned the whole story. The child's body was covered with scars, indicating that she had been abused to death. The police went to arrest Lu Chen, but she had already fled without a trace. Since Shi and Lu, in their official capacities, should have reported the discovery of the body in the inn to the police, but instead helped to abandon the corpse, the detectives arrested the two and sent them to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu requested a temporary detention because the case still needed to be investigated and Lu Chen was being pursued. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefei, he ordered them to be detained pending further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Epidemic Hospital Report</h3>
<p>In August, as it was the autumn season, the weather changed frequently, and dysentery was quite rampant. According to a report from the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital yesterday, the hospital's diagnostic statistics for August have been completed. A. General Hospital (Wenjianshi Road) (1) Cholera: 40 people, (2) Dysentery: 142 people, (3) Appendicitis: 53 people, (4) Amoebic dysentery: None, Total: 257 people, 13 deaths. B. Branch Hospital (Haige Road) (1) Cholera: 1 person, (2) Dysentery: 25 people, (3) Appendicitis: 64 people, (4) Amoebic dysentery: None, Total: 147 people, 2 deaths. According to the hospital's doctors, Tong Zhiqing and Miao Qi, who spoke to reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, the above diseases are mostly caused by careless eating. It is said that illness enters through the mouth, and disaster comes from the mouth, so it is hoped that citizens will pay attention to food hygiene. It is learned that the term will expire at the end of this month, but for the benefit of the poor and sick, if sufficient funds are raised, the clinic will continue to be provided. It is hoped that major merchants and philanthropists will generously donate to support this good cause.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Qu Weng's Posthumous Works; Public Memorial Ceremony Held at the Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant</h3>

Afterwards, he established a political and legal training institute and served as the director of the Nantong Nursing Home. Mr. Ma was not only enthusiastic about education and charity, but also his epigraphy and calligraphy were admired by the world. Today is the first anniversary of Mr. Ma's death. The Chinese Epigraphy and Painting Association and the Nantong Shanghai Fellow Association and other groups have decided to hold a public memorial ceremony at Gongdelin Vegetarian Restaurant on Parker Road at 12 noon today (summer time), and exhibit Mr. Quweng's posthumous works to show their admiration and commemoration.</p>

<h3>Tram Company Cracks Down on Ticket Scalping; Ticket Seller Beats Ticket Inspector; One Ticket Seller Arrested; Currently Held in Police Station for Investigation</h3>
<p>Recently, ticket scalping by the Public Concession and French Concession tram companies has been escalating. In order to prevent ticket scalping, a strict inspection method has been jointly implemented, and many Chinese and Russian ticket inspectors have been hired to conduct inspections separately, causing the ticket sellers to feel quite restricted. As a result, there has been much friction between the ticket buyers and ticket inspectors. It even came to blows at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Fuzhou Road the day before yesterday, and both sides were taken to the police station. A tram on Route 17 was thus stopped on the side of the road. Unexpectedly, at around 11 p.m. the night before last, a trolleybus on Route 17 of the Public Concession was traveling from the Public Concession to the intersection of Kangti Road and Saposai Road in the French Concession. Wu Caichun (19 years old, native of Jiangbei, residing at No. 44 Qingdao Road), the ticket seller number 422 on the bus, was caught scalping tickets by Feng Yimin (29 years old, residing at No. 2, Lane 154, Dagu Road), a French Concession ticket inspector number 38. Wu resisted and argued, and when the bus arrived at the terminal station, Dapu Bridge, Wu ganged up with two other ticket sellers and beat Feng, causing injuries. The patrol police arrived on the scene and arrested Wu, and sent Feng to Guangci Hospital for treatment. It is now known that Wu is still being held at the French Police Station for investigation, pending being sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution.</p>

<h3>Charitable Basketball Challenge Receives Enthusiastic Support from All Sides</h3>
<p>Xiexing Company Generously Donates Three Charity Balls, Mr. Li Xiangxu Donates Two Silver Cups, Mr. Wu Yiyun Purchases Twenty Honorary Tickets</p>
<p>The charitable basketball challenge initiated by the Shanghai Philanthropic Center and basketball enthusiasts is becoming a reality, thanks to strong promotion by the media and enthusiastic support from all sides. To date, six teams have challenged Paramount, including Huqing, Huxing, Youlian, Liangxi, Qunyi, and the Guoguang Alumni Association. Almost all of Shanghai's top basketball teams are participating, with all the famous players present. Since these six games are individual in nature, the organizing committee needs to prepare six sets of prizes and game balls. An open call for donations was made to all sectors of society the other day. As soon as the news was released, responses flooded in. Xiexing Sports Goods Company at 1000 Avenue Edward VII, through the introduction of Mr. Qian Xucang, generously donated three top-quality brand basketballs, which are quite valuable. Mr. Li Xiangxu, a prominent businessman, also donated two silver cups, the larger one to be awarded to the winning team and the smaller one to the defeated team as a souvenir. Many others have also donated prizes, such as Mr. Shen Xianglin and Mr. Gu Liancheng, who are very willing to help. Regarding ticket sales, pre-sale of tickets for the first game between Youlian and Paramount (tomorrow night) began yesterday. Many people purchased five-yuan honorary tickets yesterday. However, the sales locations did not keep a record of names. After verification, the names will be disclosed. However, it is known that Mr. Wu Yiyun, General Manager of Shunlihang on Jiujiang Road, purchased 20 tickets alone and donated 100 yuan on behalf of Shunlihang colleagues as a donation to the refugee children's education fund. His eagerness to help others is commendable. Two more ticket sales locations have been added starting today: (1) Huaan Hair Salon opposite the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road, and (2) Heming Shoe and Hat Store's main store, the first branch on Nanjing Road, and the second branch at the Jing'an Temple Paramount Shopping Center. With the addition of these three locations, there are now eight ticket sales locations, including the Hua Dong Sports Goods Company at 583 Jing'an Temple Road, Xiexing Sports Company at 1000 Avenue Edward VII, the Shenbao and Xinwenbao offices on Sanma Road, and the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge.</p>

<h3>Water Leeches Swindle People</h3>
<p>Outside the West Gate of Anqing, near the Daxing Bridge area, there are some unemployed vagrants who have trained since childhood to be able to stay underwater for three or four hours without drowning. Therefore, whenever merchant ships arrive at the shore, or when they see fabrics and other valuable goods, they invite several people to board the ship to buy them. Holding the goods in their hands, they deliberately crowd around to examine and assess them, and then suddenly fall into the water, causing both the person and the goods to disappear. Their accomplices then threaten the merchants, claiming that human life is paramount and that the family of the deceased must be notified and the county authorities informed to search for the body. Fearing trouble, the merchants often secretly pay money to settle the matter and sail away. In reality, the person who fell into the water has already come ashore at a secluded place half a mile away, and the stolen goods and extorted money are divided among the group. This practice was once rare, but recently it has become increasingly common and is even seen as a business. The locals call these people "water leeches" and look at them with disdain, so one can imagine how despised they are.</p>
<h3>Strange Birth</h3>
<p>A woman named Li in Fengqiao Town, Suzhou, had been pregnant for three years. On the 23rd of last month, she gave birth to a son with regular features and a loud voice, truly a joyous event. The delivery was no different from normal, but the pregnancy lasted for three years before birth, so the alleyways were filled with rumors. The "Difficult Classic," the "Gynecology Department," and various other books mention that a pregnancy lasting thirty-six months is called a "dragon birth." Even consulting historical records, there are many similar cases, so there is no need to make it sound mysterious.</p>

<h3>The Forgiving Spirit of Jesus Christ (III)</h3>
<p>(III) Everyone Needs God's Forgiveness: We all have sins, and we all have the possibility of re-crucifying Jesus on the cross (Hebrews 6:6), and we all need such forgiveness. Since we need God's forgiveness, we should also forgive others. Because Jesus once said, "For if you forgive other people when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins" (Matthew 6:14/15).</p>
<p>Each of us has several people who do not have good intentions towards us, and sometimes we cannot avoid suffering losses from them. If we do not learn from Jesus' example and forgive them, we will not receive forgiveness from our Heavenly Father. May we all emulate Jesus' forgiveness and reconcile with our enemies. If we have offended someone, we should ask for forgiveness. If others have displeased us, we should learn from Jesus' example and forgive them. Everyone has moments of confusion and cannot understand the other person's heart. Because of this lack of understanding, misunderstandings arise, and all the misunderstandings in the world are caused by "not knowing." Because of misunderstandings, "resentment lingers in the heart, and fairness is lost in the eyes," and people often seek opportunities for revenge, hate each other, and lose harmony.</p>
<p>"Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing." This prayer of Jesus is truly an excellent example for us. He did not "only talk the talk but not walk the walk." Rather, he "matched his words with his actions and his actions with his words." He practiced what he preached and can truly be called a model of perfection. Therefore, we should accept his call to "follow me," rectify ourselves before rectifying others, forgive others at all times and in all things, and at the same time, ask our Heavenly Father to forgive our own sins and emulate Jesus' forgiving spirit of praying for our enemies and forgiving those who offend us. "Do not do to others what you would not want them to do to you." This is the principle of forgiveness taught by our idols, but Jesus' teaching is even more proactive: "Do to others as you would have them do to you." Since you know that you cannot always please everyone and hope for others' forgiveness, you should forgive others first.</p>

<h3>Savior of Epilepsy Patients</h3>
<p>— Moming</p>
<p>Nineteen years ago, a four-year-old boy named Eugene from the state of Indiana in the United States fell on the stairs of the cellar and suffered a concussion, fainting for a few minutes. Two years later, one day, he suddenly suffered a very severe epileptic seizure. He then had minor seizures every three days and major seizures every five days, even several seizures a day or lasting for several days. He spent seventeen years of his precious life in a state of almost constant unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Since ancient times, epilepsy has been a mysterious disease because its onset is too sudden. Ancient people regarded it as demonic possession or divine punishment, so the treatment methods were extremely foolish, absurd, tragic, and cruel. Even in the 20th century, with the extreme advancement of medicine, epilepsy remained a disease that humans could not control. Eugene's life was destined to be buried in this way for a long time. But thanks to a newly invented specific drug for epilepsy—"Dilantin"—this young man was finally saved. At the meeting of the American Psychiatric Association this summer, the famous Dr. Farring led this twenty-three-year-old young man, who showed no signs of illness, and proudly reported on this amazing treatment process.</p>
<p>Eugene began treatment last November. Dr. Farring gave him a daily trial dose of 7.5 centigrams of "Dilantin" tablets. In just three days, his epileptic seizures stopped completely and never recurred. The stubborn disease that had been deeply rooted for seventeen years was unexpectedly so vulnerable.</p>
<p>But Eugene, who was now clear-headed, was still not a normal person. He seemed to have had a big dream for seventeen years. In the dream, he had not learned anything at all, and his intelligence had not developed at all with the passage of time and the growth of his body. After waking up from the dream, the twenty-three-year-old still retained the innocence and ignorance of a six-year-old. Therefore, the educational rehabilitation of this big child became the most urgent problem after the successful drug treatment. Dr. Farring transferred this heavy burden to the famous psychologist Ellen and specially hired the experienced Mrs. Fariman to serve as the nanny for this big child.</p>
<p>The results of the enlightenment were unexpectedly satisfying. Under patient guidance, his nature and intelligence developed rapidly like blooming flowers. At the beginning of treatment, his mental age was measured to be 6.7 years old. Now, after retesting, it has increased to 10.2 years old. This means that in five months, his intellectual level has improved by almost four years. This proves that long-term epilepsy did not cause as much damage to the patient's brain as generally thought.</p>
<p>The reborn Eugene is now advancing towards adulthood. He finished the first textbook in three weeks and learned addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division arithmetic. He learned how to play cards and various ball games. He can also pick up a one-year-old baby and tease it in a game, as gentle and kind as any adult can play. Recently, he has even been able to dress himself elegantly and appear in formal social situations with grace. Obviously, he will no longer be a useless waste. The miraculous new drug has resurrected him and turned him into a promising young man.</p>
<p>He still takes "Dilantin" every day, and may need to do so for the rest of his life. But this drug does not cause him any slight pain. "Dilantin" has only been around for two years as a new drug. It is the culmination of three years of dedicated research by Dr. Merritt of Harvard University and Dr. Putnam, Director of the New York Neurological Institute. Before its invention, it underwent countless meticulous tests. After its invention, it was further put into clinical practice by doctors around the world, and "Dilantin" won the honor of "Savior of Epilepsy Patients." In the past two years, thousands of people have been freed from suffering because of it. It is no wonder that all American doctors unanimously regard it as an epoch-making contribution to the treatment of mental illness.</p>
<p>Epilepsy is undoubtedly quite common in our country, and the tragic fate of patients is probably even worse than that in foreign countries. Therefore, the arrival of this savior is undoubtedly what millions of patients are looking forward to. Recently, I heard that the Shanghai Wuzhou Pharmaceutical Factory has successfully manufactured this drug first. This is naturally good news for patients and doctors. I am happy to introduce it together here and also bless the epileptic patients all over the country.</p>

<h3>Unemployment</h3>
<p>— Ding Liu</p>
<p>Dragging my exhausted body back to my apartment, I was immediately overcome by an uncontrollable wave of pain and sorrow. Like a small bird with broken wings, falling dreadfully from the sky, I really dare not imagine the terrible scene to come. I heavily walked into the room, closed the door, and sat blankly on the stool by the window, contemplation completely robbing me of my ability to think, and the air in the room also solidified.</p>
<p>The sky outside the window also had a grayish-white, heavy face, and the heat tightly surrounded my whole body, with turbid sounds constantly coming in from outside the window.</p>
<p>Filling my mind was the face of our principal, the face I will always hate. Buried behind a superficial, hypocritical smile, was such ferocity and cruelty.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Mr. Wang, please find a better position, because..." He smiled slyly, offering me a cigarette.</p>
<p>I stood there stunned, as a terrible shadow began to envelop me. I barely supported myself, calmed down, hoping to use three years of diligent work to overturn his prejudice. But this attempt was a complete failure.</p>
<p>A burst of children's playful laughter shook my nerves, and I suddenly returned to myself from contemplation, and I felt the threat to my survival...</p>
<p>Many chaotic thoughts rushed into my mind all at once, gnawing at me like small insects, and I really dare not imagine how to live.</p>
<p>I thought of a novel called "Unemployment," which described the sadness and bitterness after losing a job, and I couldn't help but force a bitter smile.</p>
<p>The steaming sunlight crawled past my window and gradually set in the west. I could no longer endure the heart that was about to be tormented into pieces. The surrounding air became even more stuffy, and I longed for distant lightning and thunder.</p>
<p>I rushed out the door and onto the street. I vaguely quickened my pace, with resentment and hot tears intertwined.</p>
<p>At night, I had a terrible nightmare... In the darkness, many ghosts surrounded me all at once, and huge stones pressed down on my body...</p>
<p>I woke up, and darkness was endlessly surrounding me. I did not cry, because I knew that the life of a young person is originally the most arduous tempering, and also, I knew that the darkness was rapidly receding, and dawn was coming soon.</p>
<p>Hawthorne Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Dancer's Fate</h3>
<p>— By Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Chapter 6 "Take Him Away"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng replied with a stern face, "Yes, but I'm not a fool after all, of course I wouldn't believe it. Later, I indeed got another piece of evidence—alas, bad luck!"</p>
<p>"What bad luck? Her actions were originally free, and you had no right to interfere with her legally."</p>
<p>"Yes, but I can't help but hate her. On the morning of the 17th, I called her house, and she didn't return home all night, spending the night outside—"</p>
<p>"Well, actually, this isn't a big deal. If you were in your wife's position, think carefully, then you wouldn't be so narrow-minded... What happened afterwards?"</p>
<p>"I rushed over immediately, but she hadn't returned yet. But soon she came home, and upon meeting, she clearly told a bunch of lies. She said she gambled all night in a gambling house and won five hundred yuan, and because she was afraid I would scold her, she told the servants to keep it a secret. Mr. Hawthorne, you don't know how good she is with words, I even believed her at the time. Later, I thought back and forth, and realized I had been deceived again. Sigh, I really hate her!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne looked at his face and said slowly, "Hating her is naturally a very natural result. But you can't seek legal help; if you abandon her, you'll have to pay alimony, and it would also be very embarrassing on the face; the best way to vent your anger is to simply beat her to death. Isn't it?"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng suddenly opened his eyes wide and shook his head, saying, "No, I didn't beat her to death. I do know who killed her."</p>
<p>As soon as Ni Jinshou heard this, he suddenly turned his face to look at the banker. "What, Mr. Lu, do you know who the murderer is? Why didn't you tell us earlier?"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng stammered, "This is what detectives are supposed to do. You should find it out yourselves—"</p>
<p>Hawthorne glanced at Ni Jinshou. "Jinshou, don't interrupt... Who is the murderer?"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng replied, "It's that guy surnamed Zhao!"</p>
<p>Hawthorne did not seem surprised by this emphatic report. He still asked faintly, "What evidence is there?"</p>
<p>Lu Jiansheng said, "Yesterday evening, Lilan and I were eating dinner at the Baimei Restaurant. We were sitting in a private room, just the two of us. About halfway through the meal, the two flexible half-doors suddenly opened slightly, and Lilan's body suddenly shook, almost screaming. I was of course also startled. Although I didn't see the face of the person in the crack of the door, there was clearly a man wearing a dark gray suit under the half-door. I quickly stood up, wanting to chase out to see who it was. But Lilan held me back. Of course I asked her who she saw. She said, 'It's an unfamiliar person, probably went to the wrong room, it's nothing.' Because the tone of her voice, and that unnatural forced smile, both revealed her secret thoughts. I knew this person was surnamed Zhao."</p>

<h3>Chaplin's Angel: Paulette Goddard's Success Story</h3>
<p>— Qinghui</p>
<p>Several years ago, Charlie Chaplin traveled around the world, passing through Shanghai. I remember he brought a girlfriend, young, lively, and beautiful, who was Paulette Goddard. Later, he returned home tired of traveling. Immediately, rumors of their secret marriage spread, but Chaplin was eccentric by nature, and Ms. Goddard was also a mysterious woman, so whether they were officially married is still a mystery. Let's leave this aside for now and talk about Paulette Goddard's success story.</p>
<p>A Girl Next Door</p>
<p>She was born in Long Island, USA. She came from a modest family. Initially, she studied in a small town nearby. She refused to study hard and was always fooling around. One day, she performed on stage at a school entertainment event, and she discovered her interest in acting, which ignited her ambition to enter the stage. When she was fifteen years old, her parents allowed her to play a supporting role in "Rio Rita," but this did not achieve any special success.</p>
<p>Instant Fame</p>
<p>However, it caught the attention of Charlie Chaplin, and they formed a deep friendship, frequenting nightclubs together. At the same time, he trained her day and night, polished her skills, and put her on the silver screen, giving her the leading role in "Modern Times," thus achieving instant fame. From then on, she wore elaborate makeup and glamorous attire, with graceful manners and a wide circle of friends. At that time, she was the most enviable woman in Hollywood, satisfied in every way.</p>
<p>Value Emotion and Gratitude</p>
<p>However, Ms. Goddard is a woman who does not forget loyalty and repays kindness. Although the words "repay kindness" are an unprecedented virtue in Hollywood, Goddard is indeed a person who values emotion and is grateful. She is not only grateful to Chaplin for promoting her to the silver screen, but also grateful for the kindness Chaplin showed her on a daily basis. Therefore, remembering the source when drinking water, she had no choice but to be deeply grateful to Chaplin.</p>
<p>A Collection of Works</p>
<p>Although Goddard has been in Hollywood for nine years, she has had few opportunities to appear on the screen. Since "Modern Times," she has been silent for four years. Until last year, she gritted her teeth and worked hard to strive for a bright future. She first co-starred with Janet Gaynor in "Dramatic School" and with Luise Rainer in "Dramatic School," and with Norma Shearer in "The Women". In addition to "The Great Dictator," which she co-starred with Chaplin again, her recent new works include "North West Mounted Police", a great masterpiece directed by Cecil B. DeMille, originally planned to be starred by Vivien Leigh or Marlene Dietrich, but this opportunity was obtained by this long-buried talented actress. Indeed, Ms. Goddard's future is truly limitless!</p>
<h3>Paulette Goddard's Smiling Face in "The Great Dictator"</h3>
<h3>Text and Illustration of Martial Arts Scented Ball</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yaozu</p>
<p>Every week I read Mr. Dong Yunxiu and Mr. Yanyan's joint work, "Twenty Kinds of Storytelling," and it has a unique flavor. Especially that illustration with crisp, bold, and tight lines fully reveals the faces and scenes of talented scholars and beautiful ladies in a vivid way. Compared to the comic books in street libraries—small book stalls, it is simply worlds apart.</p>
<p>Martial Arts Scented Ball is the last of the twenty kinds. The illustration is a "One Horse, Two Burdens" picture of Long Guanbao and Zhang Guiying. Although I am a young boy, I also like to listen to storytelling. I remember listening to Zhou Yuquan's Martial Arts Scented Ball at the Oriental Bookstore until Zhang Guiying rescued Long Guanbao, and when they rode "One Horse, Two Burdens," Zhou Yuquan said that Long Guanbao was riding backwards on the horse at that time. And he was tied back-to-back with Zhang Guiying with a rope. According to him, this was because Long Guanbao was a weak scholar and could not withstand the bumps and shocks of the horse running and jumping, preventing him from falling off the horse; and secondly, Zhang Guiying was afraid that Long Guanbao would take improper actions with his hands on the horse's back after escaping with his life. It is not unreasonable to say so, but it needs to be verified. Mr. Yanyan, do you also think it has reference value?</p>
<h3>The Power of Film Propaganda</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the European War, the belligerent countries have tried their best to use films as a propaganda tool. Germany, in order to encourage the people in the western part of Poland it occupied to move to central Poland, has made a propaganda film, which has recently been completed. The content described, of course, is the joyful situation of the people in western Poland moving to central Poland. In fact, it is not difficult to imagine the inner pain of these poor Poles, supporting the old and carrying the young, leaving their ancestral homes inherited from generation to generation, and trekking long distances to the unfamiliar central region. It is said that the actors who played "Polish farmers" in this film were only greedy for the generous rewards.</p>
<h3>All-Shanghai Harmonica Team Performs at the Da Guangming Theater</h3>
<p>The All-Shanghai Harmonica Team, gathered by harmonica master Li Houxiang from the most outstanding talents in Shanghai's harmonica groups, has been invited by the US Fourth Naval Band to participate in the Sunday Concert program at 10:00 am on September 15th. In addition to the grand ensemble of German musician Schubert's Symphony No. 8 in B minor and excerpts from the famous Italian opera "The Bohemian," there will also be a harmonica solo by young harmonica player Shu Xili, Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major, and a harmonica quintet by Lu Rongzi and others, including Boccherini's Minuet and other wonderful programs. Harmonica enthusiasts can arrive early at the Da Guangming Theater on that day to listen to the performance, so as not to miss out.</p>
<h3>Two Scenes from the Fashion Film "Prince of Thieves"</h3>
<p>Chen Yunshang Meets Ma Shi in Hong Kong to Perform in Commemoration</p>
<p>"Prince of Thieves" Will Be Shown at the Carlton</p>
<h3>Chess World</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Xuezheng from Putian</p>
<p>Opening Method, Game 69, Black Moves First</p>
<p>Cannon 2 to 5, Horse 2 advances to 3, Horse 2 advances to 3, Horse 8 advances to 9, Pawn 5 advances 1 (Variation)</p>
<p>Elephant 3 advances 1, Pawn 5 advances 1, Soldier 5 advances 1, Rook 1 moves to 2, Rook 9 moves to 8</p>
<p>Rook 2 advances 5, Advisor 4 advances 5, Rook 2 moves to 5, Cannon 2 moves to 1, Horse 8 advances to 7</p>
<p>Rook 1 moves to 2, Cannon 8 moves to 9, Rook 2 advances 6, Rook 9 moves to 8, Rook 2 moves to 3</p>
<p>Horse 7 advances 5 (Variation), Rook 3 retreats 2, Rook 5 moves to 7, Soldier 3 advances 1, Rook 8 advances 7</p>
<p>Explanation: This game is a single horse defense against a central cannon formation. At this point in the diagram, Black has a significant first-mover advantage. Red must defend well, otherwise they will be taken advantage of. Traditionally, Red's Elephant 3 advancing 1 seems like a standard move, but Black uses a central attack, and if the response is not careful, it will be difficult to equalize the situation. Red's Rook 3 retreating 2, if they move Cannon 1 advances 4, then Black's Horse 5 advances 6, Rook 3 retreats 2, Horse 6 advances 7, Cannon 8 moves to 3, Rook 5 moves to 7, then Black wins. Also, Pawn 5 advances 1 is a variation. To be continued in the next issue.</p>
