<p>社評</p>
<h3>「看牌」和「賭國運」</h3>
<p>今日的國際，是角力乎？是鬥智乎？恰最像一局撲克；偸鷄者加注不已，妄想嚇退對方，誰知對方並不示弱，偏要比實力：蓋因利害得失所關，誰願盲目斷送，到了最後關頭，惟有彼此把手中的牌，全部攤出來，拚一個高下，這叫做「看牌」Show-Uown。美國評論家說目前的遠東局勢，已走向「看牌」之途徑，這是一個恰當的譬喩。</p>
<p>日本加入三國同盟，無非想壯壯自已的聲勢。嚇退英美，滿打算美國羅斯福政府在本年十一月五日舉行大選初選之前，不致有什麼重大作爲，所以訂的之不足，還繼之‘以近衛松岡的直接挑釁，心想美國必定知難而退；美國一‘退，英國當然跟着也退；再憑着這一紙盟的，脅誘蘇聯，然後一舉而迫中國屈服，再舉而獨覇南洋，這纔初步的躊躇志滿。誰知事實的演進，反應的推移，完全相反；美國非獨不退。反而邁進；不但自己進，還有英國共進：於是一方英國宣佈重開滇緬公路，充實新加坡和澳洲的防務；一方美國準備撒退遠東僑民，並積極完成軍事佈置，「戰爭情緒頓時瀰漫於華盛頓官塲」（國際社十二日電）。本月九日赫爾國務卿和日使崛內會談的內容，雖未外洩，但就這兩三天日本發言人之「故作鎭靜」和松岡洋右之之「反覆解釋」來看，至少可以想見赫爾的警吿是十分嚴重的。</p>
<p>日本在簽訂三國盟的之後數日，他的氣燄是那麼咄咄逼人，而這兩天的多方解釋，却又是表見得那麼溫順，前倨後恭，怪不得昨今的世界輿論，都在說日本已經軟化。當然，這種軟化，也許是外交的戰略，軍事的緩兵：等到情勢轉變，或於日本有利的時候，再度硬化；不過，就目前而論，至少可以說日本的虛聲恫嚇，已經碰了頂子，吾則何至臨到「看牌」的時候，又畏縮起來呢？</p>
<p>這在稍有遠見的人都知道日本勾結德義，是凶多吉少的；即在日本國內，也有不少有識之士，引爲深憂。赤裸裸地講；德義與日本利害是不一致的，德義根本不怕得罪美國，並且還巴不得日本和美國開戰，好減少美國對於英國的接濟，所以美日如果開戰，在德義是求仁得仁，至於盟的中所規定的援助條款，在三國技術委員會還沒有具體成績的今天，那眞是天曉得了。以言日本，却逈乎不同，因爲在訂的之前，日本以騎牆爲得計，一方可在德義方面，取得聲勢上的奥援，一方更可在英美方面，敲詐一些實際的利益，現在却情勢全非，即使不致替德義『火中取栗』亦得自已挣扎於重圍之中，生死存亡，未可知也。試想日本對華作戰三年有餘，本已筋疲力盡，如何再經得起和英美對敵？中日之戰，即使算作一對一，以美國的海空軍現有實力，和造艦造機的潛能力，拿來和本來就窮，又經三年消耗的日本來比較，幾乎形成以一對五之局。所以即使把英國遠東兵力撇開不算—他在遠東的軍事設備如新加坡軍港，射力資源如印度澳洲，當然還是十二分重要的日本對付中美、等於是以一擊六；這樣不相等的實力，如果沒有別的可靠幫手，試問還能『看牌』呢？有人說，美國的海空軍根據地距離太遠，對日作戰極其不利，這當然具有相當理由；不過，也有一點不可不注意的，那就是英美澳聯防的實現。此層如果辦到，無疑地，至少可以補救大部份地理上的缺陷；何况，今日的美國，已不是去年九月的美國，他在這次歐戰中，已經經騐到許多新奇戰術；必然地，也能運用許多新奇武器；以美國的工業設備和經濟實力，添造數千架飛機或數百艘潛水艇，似乎並不需要多少時日，這是日本萬萬望塵莫及的。再加上經濟封鎖的威力，這更是日本工商界談虎色變。復次，就純粹的戰略觀點而論，美國何嘗是毫無辦法；據最近一位英國軍官所談，日美如果開戰，美國當以夏威夷爲艦隊根據地，而以菲律濱爲空軍根據地；大體上的戰略，是利用飛機轟炸日本，日如南進，必須自國內調出艦隊，那時駐什夏威夷的美國艦隊便當乘虛而入，直搗日本本部；日本艦隊如果不動，則於轟炸之外，加緊封鎖，不妨坐待日本枯竭。這種看法，可信實有相當見地。無論如何，日本如果從此眞個軟化，倒還不失爲一個聰明的識時務者，吾則，將見其爲偸雞家而自投陷阱；終至等他人捉住了鷄，然後不得不罷手。日本當局自已所說『賭國運』，即因無法取巧而將殘餘力量，作孤注一擲的意態吧！</p>

<p>歐戰叢談（二）（十）</p>
<h3>德空軍建設史略</h3>
<p>與飛機數目有同等意義的卽為德軍使用飛機的方式。德軍向以飛機作為時攻的工具，故其建設時，集中其力量製造轟炸機。在效用上，此種飛機已等於德軍之長射程大砲，將砲彈遠携數百英里，然後放射於敵人陣中。據德方宣稱，轟炸的準確，卽訓練最精的砲兵，亦不能與之媲美云。轟炸最準確的當推直降式飛機，此機之發明者原屬美國人，實為近世殺人利器中最可怕的一種</p>
<p>驅逐機的功用在保護德國領土，免受外來的襲擊。最近德國驅逐機又掩護轟炸機，往襲英倫。本來驅逐機是轟炸機之輔佐，最大功用厥在守衛。自德軍攻下荷蘭，比利時及法蘭西以來，德軍所佔有的飛機塲，距離英國甚近，於是短距離飛航的驅逐機，也能掩護轟炸機往襲英倫三島了。</p>
<p>德軍於驅逐機之外，又添增了一種「毀滅式」飛機，其功用係在長距離飛行外，又能作攻守之用。雙引擎的梅塞斯密特一一〇式，能載駕駛員兩人，卽爲此種飛機中之俊俊者。此機較諸驅逐機的武力增加倍蓰，裝有機槍四挺，小砲兩尊。能在空中四小時之久，普通的驅逐機，祇能飛行一小時半而已。</p>
<p>德轟炸機中最佳者，當推亨格爾一一一號。德機襲英卽利用此種飛機，其長途飛程往往達一千英里之遠。今日德軍無論作長途或短距離之轟炸，所持者常以此亨格爾式者爲主體。亨格爾機身較輕，能作荷重　遠之迅速飛行。據一九三九年德國航空年鑑所載，亨格爾之最高速率每小時爲三百十五英里，飛程達一千八百七十五英里，載重達二千公斤。內裝移動機槍三挺，可載四人。輕轟炸機爲杜尼爾一七式，及杜尼爾二一五式，大多作爲偵察之用，速率與亨格爾相仿，載重及飛程則遠不及。載重的爲一千公斤，飛程爲一千六百英里。</p>
<p>容克斯八七式直降飛機爲德空軍中最新利器。其直降速率每小時五百英里，可裝二百五十公斤或五百公斤之炸彈，在目標六百碼之內爆炸，卽在前進中的坦克車，或行駛中的火車，亦能炸毀之。此機的炸彈裝置於輪間，其义狀的機鈕，卽爲此機的特徵。</p>
<p>直降式轟炸機下衝時作直綫形，以整個機身爲炸彈之導引，駕駛員座前風屏上裝有一瞄準機，可供窺視。機身後部裝有可移動之機槍，兩翼有固定或可移動之機槍一桿或兩桿。五個月前，德方盛稱梅塞斯密特一一〇式機爲世界飛機中速率最高者。德軍空襲時所用者，均爲此種飛機。其最高速率爲每小時四百五十英里。備有四支機槍或兩枝機槍及一尊小砲。去春德人宜傳亨格爾一一三式驅逐機之活動力較梅塞斯密特爲佳，但實際上，梅塞斯密特式機仍爲德空軍驅逐機中的卓越利器。</p>
<p>此六種不同式樣的飛機，實卽德空軍的第一綫戰士。其他式樣的飛機大半供敎練之用。主要空軍利器祗此六種，是以在製造上，運用上及維持上，均趨於標準化，可收事半功倍之效。標準化的製造，不但可擇效用最宏的幾種飛機大量製造，卽在配置零件，及在修理上，亦佔極大便利。　今日在空中與英機作殊死戰的，亦卽上述六種飛機，而指揮其作戰方式之最高軍事當局，卽爲前述之戈林，米爾奇等四員大將。飛機的力量是吾能駕海軍而上之，此時猶未能證實，卽遲諸異日，恐亦不易作最合理之解决。惟自德軍飛渡海峽，大舉空襲英倫以來，無論德人或英人，均知能握得空中優勢者，始能握得海洋優勢。（完）</p>

<h3>金融　匯市平庸</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况，滙豐掛牌無變、英美滙暗市、半日趨勢平庸、毫無精彩、乃因週末關係、經營者買賣興趣不濃故也、結果英金因少人問津、仍吿三辦士八一二五收盤、美滙則稍帶軟、爲五元八四三七五、致本市英美滙兌又做小達三元元六角七分、</p>
<p>英平美略緊</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期長零六二五、遠期則無上落、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美勿動、對滬升一二五、美對英未更、對滬小七分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金三辦士八一二五、美滙五元八七五、較之前收均無榮辱、開後外行賣胃淡薄、市面略形軟化、英金三辦士七九六八七五、及美滙五元八四三七五可結、但成交鮮少、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動，白銀平衡稅揭曉升半分、此後華行忽來吐塞、市勢微鬆、計售予投機商十月份美滙五元八四三七五、繼又與美行大通吐予有利及華行上海等本月份美滙五元八七五、斯時現貨英金三辦士八二八一二五、難結難賣、美滙五元八七五可結、但不久賣風消散、投機商繼續扒進、潛勢復形帶軟、惟英金因無人問津、爲狀殊定、迄收盤英金主辦士八一二五、美滙五元八四三七五、十一月份英金三辦士七九六八七五、美匯五元八一二五、結果比上日現期英平美緊零三一二五、午後週六無市、</p>
<p>香港美匯縮</p>
<p>香港十二日（週六）電、今晨滙市開盤英平美緊、英滙現期貨及日匯現貨均無變動、美滙現貨軟零六二五、爲二十三元零六二五、（昨晚收爲二十三元一二五、）申滙現貨升五元、爲三百九十三元、九時十五分微緊、美滙現貨續較零六二五、爲二十三元、九時二十五分吿緊、美滙現貨再軟一二五、爲二十二元八七五、九時五十五分吿平、美貨現貨回鬆零六二五、爲二十二元九三七五、申滙現貨回降二元、爲三百九十一元、十一時三十分平穩、申滙現貨續降二元、爲三百八十九元、下午週六無市、</p>

<h3>金市穩中帶堅</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤、於買賣敵對之下、走勢尙穩、半日間起伏頗狹、蓋滙市已入徘徊之狀、金價亦跟之盤旋、晨開爲五千五百九十元高盤、乃美滙報緊、惟不久錢兌業首來拋空、斯時金號帮亦賣、曾跌至五千五百五十元低價、收盤前因滙市微緊、證劵帮銀號競扒、遂爲五千五百八十元收盤、結果比上日軋漲十元、午後週六無市、半天交易的三千餘兩、以軋平與了結居多、銀樓飾金與海關金等均吿平定、</p>
<p>烚赤軋漲十元</p>
<p>晨初開市堅穩、較上日做高二十元，金號進錢兌業二十元、爲五千五百九十元、繼因某錢兌業趁高拋空、加之現金號跟之吐賣、市勢頓轉下游、回落至五千五百六十元、旋賴證劵帮稍扒、曾又漲至五千五百七十元、卒因斯時某金號忽來猛塞、一時買戶旁觀、遂跌達五千五百五十元低盤、嗣幸某錢兌業獲利補空、且賴證券帮銀號多頭加碼、驟升至五千五百八十五元，午刻買者减少、錢兌業及散多吐出、復又挫至五千五百七十五元、惟收盤則爲五千五百八十元、結果比上日軋漲十元、收後潛勢先跌續漲、初做低至五千五百七十元，最後經證券帮等扒進、復抬至五千五百八十五元、半天四十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤校高十餘元，收進減低三十元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>飾金尙無變動</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、始終未動、大同行仍懸五百七十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低三十元光景、</p>
<p>外幣所漲甚微</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、烚赤盤旋略漲、中美金鎊因亦微漲五角、英金票供求均勻、市價站平、美金票在狹小範圍內盤旋、始曾高至十六元八角二分、繼而步退至六八角八分、卒爲十六元七角四分、比上日軋漲四分、香港蔡微升三分、日金票賣風已戢、市價回漲、晚市爲一元三角六分半、朝鮮票需要較殷、市價趨漲、晚市升爲一元一角五分、</p>
<h3>糧食　蕪湖客秈　到埠不下萬集餘包　洋米欲賣無受主</h3>
<p>洋米在到定蟬聯之下、行情繼續趨落、早晨開市後、賣氣愈旺、實銷與客囤兩呆、而新交易又有數起證實、現洋米立卽下疲、雖本米唯一之脚踏車來源、突告阻絕、且　水轉緊、有一部份大戶堅持不賤脫、然逐步抑落、午市已比前午小七八角至近元，比前晚小三五角、午後回籠貨欲拋而無受主、市乃再降三五角、新交易證實者計有建源公司二號西貢一千噸、價七十五元七角半、愼記洋行五百噸、價七十五元三角、一說尙未足額、又昨報華南企業公司之一千噸祇有七十五允成議、因此人心軟弱、米市在此近期內殊有續降之必耍、</p>
<p>破粳昨有蘇同粳開出五六十包、價為八十二元、甫港早稻八十一二元，次至七十七八元、與前市相較亦乏榮辱、</p>
<p>新粳尖及窰咱百哥等祇河下到四五百包、售價以去路平常均呈定局、未有軒輊、開閔行新粳七十八元、靑角審種八十元、七十九元、西塘百哥七十七元、靑角杜尖七十元零五角、次至六十八元、太倉羊尖六十七元，蕪湖客尖日來抵埠者不鮮、計有大輪三儎不下萬餘包、價開六十一二元、糯米國洋兩貨悉無軒輊、</p>
<h3>洋粉存底不厚</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨華廠供應依然稀少，本街實銷、欲購乏貨、致回籠老車牌俏至十八元六七角、惟籌碼已少、交易僅二三百包而已、客盤仍爲十八元四五角、因値週末之期、亦無相當成交、惟洋粉存底已薄、雖有巨額洋粉之成交、恐後批來源不繼、關於美政府中止出口津貼問題、頗足影響市面、故人心尤爲扳守也、聞高牌洋粉價須十九元以上、洋砲台及雙鷹價須十八元八角半至八角、由本街購去一千餘包、市面脚地頗穩、</p>
<p>小麥　昨市堅硬如故、因目下供源寥寥、貨主一味　守、而各廠進冐亦殊不濃厚、送入租界之高檔麥、喊價須廿七元、但未續開、統市僅送廠貨三五百包、仍以原盤作價云、</p>
<h3>證券　內價買賣相埒　市價高低互見</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨市已趨安定、市價升沉於一二角之間、買戶雖多、賣戶亦不弱、稍低卽有買戶、惟鼎康及十六號則始終買進、似又在醞釀變化、故有舉棋不定之狀、昨日上午鼎康首先買進、十六號繼之而起、旋以鴻大聯益賣出、而市氣頓鬆、但亦旗鼓相當，午前無甚榮辱、午後鼎康及十六號仍有吸收、聯和聯益亦有抵補、市價昨高一三角、終以同昌樂茂鴻生源源賣出而壓低、結果高低互見、一二角之參差而已、成交總數、共計約一百五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交華商證券交易所股五十股、價爲二十六元二角半、</p>
<p>倫敦十一日（週五）電、今日中國外債及遠東英商各公司股票掛牌行市、仍吿平滯、祗麥加利銀行股獨升二先令六使士、便爲七鎊正、其餘不動，</p>
<h3>紗花　銷令雖過　棉紗投機　還在興高采烈</h3>
<p>紗市仍在迴旋之境、但人心多數看升、然現銷時令、已漸漸過去矣、不過滬埠游資尙充斥、近來外滙及黃金投機、比較乏味、還是棉紗呼吸、較有興趣、所以幕後抬高撳低、大有人在、市價倐上倐下、前途波濤仍在隱伏中、今日有棉紗三千七百十五件運香港、</p>
<p>現紗晨開人氣熱烈、一般叫喊者、紛亂如蔴、然新買者不旺、均抱隔岸觀火主義爲多、二十支雙馬首盤做一謙一百七十五元、多方雖叫高、然接受者未見踴躍、反見獲利者吐出、市情徐徐卞挫、至一千一百六十五元、中途浮多及搶帽子之流、較爲活動、又見上升、收盤價爲一千一百七十三元、查半日間成交統計三千四百六十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲五元、茲將各幫口買去之額量、分列如左、</p>

<p>統計三、四六五　　廠胃不展　棉市僵局</p>
<p>現棉情形仍屬堅而靜、人心大都望升、但廠方吃胃不展、所以益呈僵局、不過同業互相買賣、點綴不少、</p>

<p>蘇得蘭　二六三·〇〇　長豐進一〇〇件</p>
<p>油市　本月下半期油　已開始解貨</p>
<p>咋日食油市况、照現貨行情觀察、尙有變化、惟期貨生油因現貨見積、訂十月下半月交貨者、亦已開始解貨、况且原根放出、籌碼允充溢、產地價格亦無大上落、故人心不免虛怯、晨初市氣頗疲軟、午後一般趁火打刦之投機家、又復騷動拉抬、市又冉冉上升、結果較上日轉砌二三角、計成交膠州現豆油五十件、價爲七十九元、烟岐豆油五千件、價爲八十一元、大連油十桶、價爲一百十一元、大有廠豆油一百担、價爲九十元、花生油做開膠州現油二百件、價爲七十八元二角半至七十九元、十月下交六百件、價同現油、又靑島現浦二百桶、價爲一百零六元二角至一百零九元、十月下交一百桶價爲一百零八元至零八元二角半、十一月上交一百五十桶、價爲一百零九元五角至零九元七角半云、</p>
<h3>疋頭　嗶嘰直貢細布　隨紗提漲</h3>
<p>國布　昨布市始平繼漲、緣實銷仍乏進展、而人心因原料堅昂、布價壓抑、執貨者態度鎭定、囤戶伺機仍欲拖進、昨以細紗激漲、嗶嘰直貢及府綢等坯布價均上漲每疋三五角、粗布斜紋色布等平平、本街成交坯布色布粗布等六百餘件、粤港幫辦斜紋色布等二百餘件、蘇北各地辦色布色斜等一萬餘疋、北路烟津幫辦絨布色布粗布等一百數十件、</p>

<p>各銀行鈔票眞偽之鑒別（十）　沈鋆</p>
<p>補遺茲有詢交通十三年版華德路公司承印之十元、一元鈔未曾列入、茲答復如下、</p>
<p>十元券其圖案正反均爲綠色、正面中間圖景與三年版十元鈔同、兩傍爲十元數字、反面中間爲該行大厦景、兩傍爲阿刺伯數字、此券已全部收回、不冉發行、</p>
<p>一元券其圖案正反均爲淡黃色、正面中間圖景與三年版一元鈔同、兩傍爲一元數字反面中間爲該行大厦景、兩傍爲阿刺伯數字、此券因印刷不佳、恐易製造僞鈔、發出少數後、隨卽收回不發、</p>
<p>故該行十三年版鈔票、除五元券市上尙有發見外、其餘十元·一元·業已早經絕跡、因此未曾列人、</p>
<p>更正</p>
<p>「八行雜鈔」四明誤爲四行、浙江興業誤爲中國興業、特此更正、</p>
<h3>（六）外埠鈔票與停兌鈔票</h3>
<p>民國十五年印行之中央劵有漢口地名及湘鄂贛三省通用大洋券十六年四月武漢政府下令集中現金中·中·交三行券停止兌現於十七年冬始由國府財部予以整理以十七年金融長期公債照票面十足掉換中央券掉換期以十八年七月底為止逾期卽行作廢現在市上發見者即該項作廢券尙有廣東·福建·二省地名亦為同樣廢券</p>
<p>中國之漢口地名券現仍可掉換金長公債惟須滿十元單位方可掉換</p>
<p>該行尙有民國元年版黃帝像兌換券祇上海·江蘇·浙江·地名可以通用北京地名可以滙入內地其餘各省地名均已作廢停兌因之更改地名券甚多且改印甚佳不能鑒別祇有該行查對號碼方能識別何種號碼為保處地名鈔票</p>
<p>又有東三省地名鈔票及察哈爾地名鈔票哈爾濱地名鈔票均亦逾期停兌作廢</p>
<p>該行漢口券有舊版新版兩種先時舊版漢券亦與中國漢券相同停兌後祇可掉換金長公債以後該券大部掉回未掉加者　額已少乃亦可與滬券同樣通用至廿八年七月始與新版券照華北券辦法祇可滙入內地</p>
<p>尙有東三省地名鈔票亦已停兌作廢</p>
<p>該行之北小地名鈔票以及未改組前該行老鈔均已停兌作廢</p>
<p>外埠券滙入內地點為四川·雲南·廣西·貴州·天津·山東·六省</p>
<p>八行外埠券須分別由接收行通滙</p>
<p>民國元年版黃帝像兌換券關於歷史性甚大且為吾國鈔票信用創一新紀元　上海民初流通鈔票以洋商銀行發行者居多數其後吾國鈔票信用漸增發行額亦漸廣至五年袁世凱稱帝　下令停止兌現其他銀行均奉令停兌中國銀行各地分行有停兌者有暫取觀望態度者因是引起金融界之大恐慌惟上海中國銀行深知上海金融關係之重要竭力維持信用存款鈔票一律兌現絕大風潮遂消弭於無形滬地鈔票信用於是奠就穩固之基礎</p>
<p>該行尙有廿元券一種因使用不便已全部收回然非停兌券如有發見仍可通用</p>

<h3>美駐華海軍　尙未作撤退準備　外間謠傳證明全屬無稽　美橋撤離全係預防性質</h3>
<p>外傳美海軍麥令隊、將由中國撤退、以致麥令隊所屬各機關、業於準備結束、正向本埠美商銀行提取存款云云、茲據可靠方面稱、此項消息、完全不確、此間美海軍麥令隊迄未接到準備撤退之訓令、故一時不致有若何行動、按上項謠傳、發生於數日前、甚至謂本埠美商銀行、拒絕僱客開立新戶、並限制提存每次不得超過一百元說、經記者調查之下、證明全屬無稽、同時關於撤退旅滬美僑家屬之提議、此間美領事當局迄未提出更進一步之訓令、自華盛頓消息說明撤退僑民之提議完全爲一種預防萬一之辦法後、此間美僑之情緒、已不若以前之緊張、而空氣已大見和緩矣、</p>
<p>滬後備員　檢騐體格</p>
<p>又外傳橋居滬上之美海軍後備員六十名、奉命前往麥令隊司令部報到、並聆受關於彼等未動之訓令一節、經記者向調查所得、頗有言過其實之處、蓋此等後備員、僅係向司令部請騐體格而已、此項體格之檢騐、每年舉行一次、昨日檢騐時、有二人查明不及格、將不參加訓練、昨日本埠美僑間曾盛傳美海軍後備員將加入十月六日華盛頓所發海軍總動員之命令</p>
<p>領署通知　昨已發出</p>
<p>英文大美　報云、駐滬美代理總領事布特烈克頃吿記者、美領署今日（十二日）發出通知書、勸吿本市美僑無留滬必要者、得機速卽退出上海、布氏拒不披露通知書內容、惟稱、此項通知書、與報載華盛頓電傳者、大同小異、</p>
<p>各大商行　自行資遣</p>
<p>本市美商行如上海電話公司與美孚油公司等已得美國總公司准許、由公司出資遣送雇員與眷屬返美、某主要美商頃語記者、渠信建議中之撤退本市美橋一舉、將完全實行云、又聞北平美大使館館員數人、已撤記北平返美、</p>
<p>預定船位　僅係登記</p>
<p>昨據　國總統輪船公司客票部宣稱、近日報載美僑返國、客票均已定罄等情、實與最近國際局勢無關、因中美太平洋航綫、本市美商航業機關、祗有該公司一家、雖另有英商昌興公司、日商日本郵船公司等數家、但美僑決不趁他國船隻、故該公司之客票、在德義日宣布同盟前、已將本年內赴美各輪船位預約一空、但大多僅係登記、屆時是吾購票、又一問題、</p>
<h3>鎭海口日艦　砲轟鎭海　城區內落彈廿一枚　毀屋廿餘問無死傷</h3>

<p>挪威代辦　離滬赴渝</p>
<p>挪威代辦克佐崇、近爲晋謁中樞當局、並與中國政府保持密切接觸起見、特離滬轉港赴渝、預定行程、將在新都勾留數星期後、卽搭機　港返滬、</p>
<h3>黃宣平　昨被綁架</h3>
<p>本地人黃宣平、年三十四歲、滬寓赫德路六六九號、平日黃有五四六九號自備汽車一輛代步、昨日中午十二時四十五分左右、黃身穿西服、由公司步出、在慕爾鳴路口跨登汽車、自行駕駛返家午餐、當時車向西行、至靜安寺路赫德路抵其家門時、突由路旁躍出豫伏之綁匪三名、各執手槍、將車攔住、嚇阻聲張、並躍入車內、迫黃行駛、連人帶車、一同綁架無踪、旋黃家屬得悉情形、乃前往靜安寺捕房報吿、請求訪緝、捕房據報、立派中西探捕馳往追捕及查勘、但已失踪跡、乃通知各區捕房及法捕房注意該號汽車行踪、逾一小時、該車在滬西某路發現、</p>
<h3>國慶日節約儲蓄　成績至為美滿　認儲踴躍超過預定數額　各界厲行節約繼續力行</h3>
<p>本埠為紀念雙十國慶、曾於是日熱烈推行節約建國儲蓄運動、各界為表現愛國熱情、發展經濟建設、貫澈騰利基礎起見、紛認儲款額、風起雲湧、極爲踴躍、業已超過預定目標、成績殊爲圓滿、各界並鑒於節的建國意義重大、故均摒除奢靡逸豫惡習、實踐臥薪嘗胆精神、以力行利人利己之節建儲蓄運動、故嗣後認儲數額、將形激增、</p>
<h3>法商水電工潮　勞資仍未接近　法租界當局正努力調處　工人方面昨又增加條件</h3>
<p>法商水電公司工潮、於前日突形擴大後、昨日仍無開展之象、罷工工人總數的一千二百餘人、聞昨日又曾一度集會、議決（一）於十六條要求以外、增加要求發給外勤工人制服及年賞津貼、（二）堅持須由資方承認六項先決條件後、始允全體復工、但據記者所知、資方對先決條件、已表示無法接受、且表示對「新工會」所推舉之代表、公司不能予以承認、而與之舉行談判、以致雙方各趨極端、無法接近、交通全部陷於停頓中、至被捕工人之一部、昨已釋放、查爲司機韓方貴等七人、及賣票顧大海等五名、</p>
<p>捕房當局　從事調解</p>
<p>昨日下午勞方代表四人、前往法捕房政事部請求調解、該部當予接受、雙方會談甚久、勞方代表始行辭出、嗣後政事部與公司方面亦有所商洽、談判結果、較前數日有進步、似最近可望解決、</p>
<p>電力廠前　嚴密保護</p>
<p>昨日法租界情形、甚爲緊張、電力廠門外駐有法捕房警捕多名、嚴密保護、同時白俄工人、大多數日夜留居在廠內、以防止罷工工人之襲擊或綁架、法租界之電氣供給、一時尙不致有中斷之虞、自星期五上午全體華職工罷工後、已僱用白俄臨時工人六十名、協助歐籍職員、維持工作、</p>
<h3>滬西特警　成立無望　工部局探捕維持治安</h3>
<p>滬西越路築路「特警」問題、工部局警務處長包文少校擬具建議意見書、交總裁兼總辦費利溥達傅筱庵後、卽靜候覆文、因該項公件、經翻譯成中英日三國文字、故往返濡滯、迄未獲覆、自傳被刺身死後、該項談判、已重陷於停頓狀態、近日包文少校與對方亦未舉行私人性質談話、故「特警」問題、一時當無成立「特警隊」希望、目前工部局警察處對越界築路段內之治安、仍照常派探捕維持、並由寓國商團白俄隊及意駐滬防軍桑麻哥部隊、共同協助、</p>
<p>滬西日兵　巡邏頻繁</p>
<p>近日滬西一帶、日兵往返頻繁、並列隊游行、大西路·安和寺路·陸家路各地、終日均有武裝日憲兵騎自由車不斷巡邏、徐家滙區自槍殺日兵案發生後、天文台天主堂日三浦憲兵隊部、戒備已較前嚴密、兵士亦均結隊出入、以防不測、</p>
<h3>今日起　恢復老鐘點</h3>
<p>滬市日光節的時間、經當局通吿、於昨日午夜中止、今晨零時起、各界遵照當局規定、已一律將時計撥回一小時、各機關·公團·學校及工商界、自今日起、均恢復老時間辦公或營業、兩租界公共汽車及有無軌電車、所有車輛進廠出廠及職工交替、亦恢復老鐘點之車務時刻、上海銀行業·錢業·兩公會、爲恢復原時間營業、昨發表公吿云、查日光節的辦法、本市兩租界當局定於十月十二日（星期六）中夜終止、本兩公會會員行莊同時將時計撥遲一小時、回復六月一日前原時間營業、特此公吿、</p>

<h3>右圖係　國海軍總司令李嚞遜上將在太平洋閱操留影</h3>
<h3>美國海軍的新兵器</h3>
<p>自上次世界大戰以來，歐美各國對於新兵器的製造，層出不窮。空軍方面在這次大戰中表演的，有直降轟炸機；有利用降落傘的「空中步兵」；陸軍方面，有摧堅如拉朽的坦克車；海軍方面所表演的似乎較少，但德雜兩國已在袖珍艦之外，發明了一種小型高速率魚雷艇，在驚濤駭浪的大洋中，放射魚雷。據稱其破壞力殊爲强大，雖巨艦當之亦不能倖免。此種小型魚雷艇之稱造及運用，在德義方面，頗守機密，故知其底蘊者尙少。美國海軍部對於此種小艇能力，初頗置疑，嗣在阿比西尼亞戰時，見義大利曾用這種小快艇在地中海向英國海軍示威，近則以德軍在鄧扣克之役，謂曾利用此種小型魚雷艇及飛機擊沉及毀壞英國護送艦二十一艘之多，於是亦急起直追，大量製造，大的至一九四二年初卽可完成一「蚊子艇」艦隊了。（見圖）</p>
<p>所謂「蚊子艇」艦隊者，卽形容此種放射魚雷快艇之嬌小玲瓏也。自首至尾其長不過一百十尺左右，裝有魚雷放棄管四具，機關槍四挺。除艇長外，的可載水兵七八人。每小時速率達至四十海里。在水上絕駛時，又能左右旋轉，進退自如。故雖遇飛機在上轟炸，不但目標較小，卽其靈動如蛇之姿態，出如脫兎之速率，足使該艇不易擊中。此種快艇，其形態較之巨型巡洋艦，固如小巫之見大巫，但其所裝魚雷四枚，其力已足當普通魚雷艇力量之一半，其造價只不過抵到一艘魚雷艇的三十分之一而已</p>
<p>這種魚雷快艇將爲美國海軍的新武器，指揮和駕駛也都屬海軍中的新人材。因爲駕駛這種姿態靈活，變化多端的快艇，非得思想靈敏，手脚矯健的靑年不爲功。所以這「蚊子艇」艦隊的指揮官，雖則是個高級魚雷專家，而年紀却輕得很，還只有三十上下，可說是美國海軍中最年靑的軍官了。每艘艇長年紀格外輕，大的離開畢業時間還不足六七年之久，「猶有童心」這四個字，庶可以形容他們的神態。這在美國海軍的傳統精神中，是一種破格的「錄用」了。</p>
<p>爲美國設計建設這種「蚊子艇」艦隊者，並非海軍界的耆宿，而是一個前進的商人。他名叫亨利薩脫芬，現年六十五歲。格魯東電船公司副總理。他具有前進的思想，勇往直前的精神。從小小的一個僮役，升任爲公司經理。他以新的設計，創成遊艇的大量生產。歷年以來，卽中人之家亦得享受遊艇樂趣了。美國船初次　用地塞爾引擎的，卽爲薩脫芬所經營的公司的產品。</p>
<p>一九一五年初，德國潛水艇橫行海上，造成大西洋未有的恐怖。英政府代表問計於薩脫芬，有沒有抵禦的妙法。薩氏答稱：「用一隊小快艇好了」。潛艇驅逐艦的設計卽肇端於此。在戰前，薩脫芬的公司每年的造這種十二艘左右。至是他却對英政府代表說：「我們可以每天製造一艘」。英國船廠和海軍部專家顧問等，均晚這是不可能的事。但海軍部信任薩氏的話，叫他去試試看。薩脫芬和他的設計師於埋頭苦幹之餘，卒於四百四十八天工作日期中，造成了五百五十隻潛艇驅逐艦。</p>
<p>其後美國參戰，薩脫芬亦卽以造製潛艇驅逐艦獨得之秘，貢獻於國家。並以統一樓準之方法，完成運輸艦船之大量生產額。鋼壳之船，其製造之速度，有若縫工之裁衣。其造船之方法，係先製造劃一的零件，然後逐一依照圖樣裝配，頃刻之間，一艦卽可裝配成功。好像小孩子搭玩具的船舶一樣。</p>
<p>迨上次歐戰結束，薩脫芬重理舊業，其所督造之潛艇驅逐艦由政府售之民間，改作漁船及渡船之用。其時美政府尙沒有想到要編成「蚊子艇」艦隊。直到一九三八年，義大利與德國的小型快艇始爲美海軍當局所注意。可是許多守舊的海軍將校，仍注重戰鬬艦，巡洋艦，驅逐艦，對於這種小快艇的武力，嗤之以鼻。但是若干高級軍官却不作如是之想，終於決定建設「蚊子艇」艦隊。羅斯福總統且已要求國會通過一百五十萬美元的建設費了。</p>
<p>海軍部預定於一九四一年與一九四二年間，完成這個艦隊。試用艇有已建造完成的，有正在實地試騐中的，將來彙集各艇優劣，以最後一種最完美的作爲大量建造之標準。故目下海軍部雖已有此種快艇發現，但離編隊之期尙有相當時日，他日正式運用時，其產量亦將如秋夏之交，蚊子之聚集紛擾也。</p>
<p>薩脫芬所經營的公司卽爲得標承造者，其所設計之一百十呎快艇，業巴在試騐之中。一九三九年初，薩氏見歐洲戰雲密佈，對於一九四二年完成「蚊子艇」艦隊之舉，心中未免惴惴，深恐其離實際運用之力量，尙有欠缺之處也。海軍部爲尊重薩氏之意見起見，特遣之赴英考察。他對於英國著名快船賽跑家司高脫貝恩所設計七十呎長的快船最爲賞識。這船週身作流綫型，底平，每小時可行四十至五十英里。卽在波濤洶湧的海面駛行，震顚亦比較的輕微。運用自如，輾轉靈使，允爲特色。可裝魚雷四個，機槍叫挺，發動機爲强力的羅士勞埃期式。因其船舷寬廣，甲板以下，可供軍官一人，水兵七人運用，尙覺綽綽有餘。</p>
<p>薩脫芬當時卽以三十萬美元購置一艘，並與司高脫　恩商得在美製造權。返美後，他邀請海軍部人員試坐，結果大家認爲滿意。薩氏担保至一九四一年春，可造成此種快艇二十五艘，並卽以此爲他日大量生產的籃本。海軍部贊成其議，於是着手進行，至目下試騐之船已接踵造成矣。如遇必要，造船速率尙可增高。據海軍部中人預測，在兩年之內，美國可完成此種「蚊子艇」二百艘之艦隊。</p>
<p>海軍專家以爲馬達魚雷艇之妙用頗多。最顯著者，當如德軍利用直降轟炸機一般。在攻擊部隊之前，直趨敵陣。他們如果遇到航空母艦，其所放射的魚雷卽可奏最大的效用。在白天他們攻擊敵艦像曰光一閃，行動異常敏疾。夜間又能偷窺敵艦，神出鬼沒，不易為人覺察。他們並能攻襲海港，驅逐潛艇，在狹水淺港中進攻敵艦，還能作巡視偵察之用，這都是馬達小型魚雷艇的長處。</p>
<h3>特戈爾將軍在英檢閱法軍</h3>
<h3>美國海軍坦克</h3>
<p>美國海軍部近已定造水陸兩用坦克車多輛（見面），無論入水登岸，爬坡穿森皆能行駛自如。美國海軍部官員參觀此車試騐後，認爲頗有功用，於不易登陸時，可用以從軍艦戰運士兵與軍需登陸。此種水陸兩用坦克車可載兵士四十名，每小時速率在陸上爲二十五哩，在水面為八哩半。車兩側齒輪頗闊，行於泥灘，如履平地</p>
<h3>不列顚的戰之轉捩</h3>
<p>歐戰第一年的戰果，造成了一洲大陸給一個島國遏制住的局面。在短短的數月前，情形適得其反。那時候，英倫三島危急萬份，隨時有被大陸方面德軍機械化强權壓倒之慮。那時候，不列顚，及其後面處境危殆不下於不列顚的全部西方世界，都是門戶洞開，無法阻擋國社黨大規模的火與鋼的飛快部隊前來衝擊。從披倫尼斯山脈以至北角，歐洲全部大西洋岸，德軍機械化軍備巨人似的虎視着，準備從陸海空三面，猛撲那「小小的不列顚島國」。</p>
<p>今日呢，外表上雖絕少改觀，然而戰局已完全不同了。軍事形勢在大體上似乎無甚出入。國社黨同樣的飛快部隊，在急難的數星期之內，用不可思議的閃電戰術，轟炸燒殺，攻陷波蘭，攻陷丹麥挪威，攻陷荷蘭比利時，攻陷法國——這些同樣的轟炸機隊和數百萬結集的摩托化軍隊，仍在他們所攻陷的歐洲海岸，兇險的登候着。</p>
<p>但是局勢已是今非昔比了。英國現今已把國社黨的德國及其同盟，法西斯黨的義大利，遏制住了，至少同它自身一樣的被厭緊了。苦戰一年之後，英國現已在海陸空三方面中的二方面，卽海空兩方面採取攻勢，這是無可吾認的事實。至於在陸地方面，尙須相當時日，始能編成攻擊部隊。</p>
<p>要瞭解軍事形勢的眞相，須把現今的局勢與六月底的情形，作一比較而後可。六月底，法國已經一蹶不振，與德國所簽訂的停戰條約，已把北半部山河及全部大西洋岸聽任德軍盤據。法國海宅根據地盡入德軍之手，法國的艦隊有隨時被德軍攫取的可能，當時不列顚的命運似已絕望。英國軍事專家現已承認，德軍當時如以全力進攻，英國的抵抗力實成問題。卽邱吉爾首相公開演說，亦已顯露退往加拿大繼續作戰之意，局勢的危殆可想而知</p>
<p>在那六月杪黑暗的一星期，記者會與許多中立觀察家討論大局，除兩個人外，其餘都對英國前途表示悲觀。及至上星期（九月初），我再向他們詢問，他們的答案完全改變了。除一二人外，大都對於英國前途表示樂觀，咸信德軍進攻英倫三島已不可能，卽欲嘗試定必失敗。</p>
<p>這種戰局的轉捩，原因在那哩呢？其一在於英國二十萬大軍能自鄧扣克撇退回國；其二在於英國海軍的解決法國艦隊；其三在於英國空軍能對付德機大規模轟炸，且能猛力還擊。美國海軍部長諾克斯曾謂，英國得勝的機會已增至百分之五十，不過英國人都自信必能獲得最後勝利。（節譯Christian　Science　Monitor）</p>

<h3>怎樣應付測騐</h3>
<p>— 吳餘生</p>
<p>最近一二週內，各校都要舉行學月測騐了。各位小朋友，你們在測騐前應該怎樣準備？測騐時應抱怎樣態度？以及測騐後應該怎樣反省？這幾個問題大家都應注意的吧！</p>
<p>（一）測騐前的準備　多數小朋友逢到測騐，往往沒有甚麼準備，只是臨時抱佛脚，這種自暴自棄的小朋友，我們不足取法，我們應該先對於各種功課的內容，約略溫習一遍，其次逐課分別詳加推敲，把每課的要點，摘錄出來，並且自己多多設想問題，設法釋疑，間有不明瞭處，卽行請問敎師，務使對於全部功課，能够確切明瞭。最好在距離測騐前數小時內，可不必再溫書籍，反而擾亂思想，疲勞精神，應當把硏究心得整理下，使成爲有系統·有條理·有組織的材料，這時頭腦須要楚，態度須要鎮靜；然後才能應付裕如呢！</p>
<p>（二）測騐時的態度　在測騐時最要注意的有二點：一要誠實，二要經濟，所謂誠實，就是要全憑自己的判斷和理解，萬一對於某　答復不出，切不可私下商酌，只圖眼前的分數，而失却測騐的眞意，所以這是應當注意的。至於經濟，就是要顧及時間的經濟，只可在規定時間內，充分發揮，不要爲了某一問題，就此擱淺起來，專把某題爲對象，以致時間浪費，很是可惜。所以遇着難題，不妨暫且擱筆，先選會做的統統做了，然後再把該題悉心硏究，求出一個正確的答案，這樣才不致影響全部的成績呢！</p>
<p>（三）測騐後的反省　測騐以後，應當下一番反省功夫，這次測騐的成績怎樣？失敗的原因在那裹？須把測騐經過仔細反省一下，如已找到什麼缺點，那麼立刻決意下次須要努力改進，大家不要以爲測騐以後，就可以隨便了事的。　（稿酬移捐）</p>
<h3>學生的三種典型</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>我記得，有一位朋友吿訴我聽一椿故事，說到做學生的，有三種典型，無論小學生中學生大學生，都不出這三種範圍，那末這三種典型的名稱叫什麼呢？讓我慢慢的道來：</p>
<p>第一種是泉水典型：這種典型的學生，好似濟南的趵突泉，無錫的惠山泉，杭州的虎跑泉，小點兒說，也好似家庭裏的一口井，從地層各處吸來一點一滴的水，經過泥沙的濾淸，成爲終年不涸，取之不竭用之不盡的泉水，這種學生能够從各方面自動的去求知識，能够將各方面的一知一識，經過自己的選擇和研究，成爲自己的眞知眞識，所以這一種學生最好。</p>
<p>第二種祭鸚鵡典型：這種典型的學生，好似鸚鵡一般，老師化了很多的精神去敎他甚麼，他也化了很多的精神學會甚麼；他所知道的不會比老師的增多，却只會比老師敎的减少，這一種學生只能　中等。</p>
<p>第三種是漏斗典型：漏斗式的學生最要不得，可以說這種學生是學生中最末等的了，無論學的功課難易，無論學的分量多少，他總像漏斗一樣，完全漏得乾乾凈凈，換句話說，這種學生，學什麼，忘記什麼，學多少忘記多少。</p>
<p>小朋友！上面三種典型的學生，你們歡喜做那一種？我想，你們一定會異口同聲的舉手說「我要做泉水典型」那末好！大家努力罷！</p>
<h3>吃閒食的結果</h3>
<p>— 金箴</p>
<p>慧是一個喜吃閒食的孩子，每當他放學回家，便吵着他母親要買東西吃，母親眼見他上課一天，太辛苦了，當然伊是不會不答應的，便隨手拿了幾張分幣劵授給了他，阿慧便一溜烟的跑到外邊去了，因爲他多吃閒食，允其喜歡吃糖果，時時發生牙痛。一到了牙齒發痛的時候，他便搖着頭，像發誓般的下回總不多吃糖了，那知牙痛一好，手裏又拿着糖了。</p>
<p>有一天的傍晚，阿慧的牙痛病又發作了，阿明—他的哥哥，便笑嘻喀地對他說道：「這是多吃糖的結果啊。你瞧，我平日除了一日三餐之外，不大多吃閒食，所以從沒有嘗到牙痛的滋味。糖果雖是好吃的，可惜多吃了要牙痛，這是不好受的。你耍知道，糖少吃，對於我們身體確有幫助消化的功能，可是多吃了，非但無益，更除了牙痛外，可使牙齒由硬而變爲軟弱，因多吃了糖，使血液易成酸性，如血液帶酸性，便立卽要排洩到體外，於是通到腸，那酸刺激腸壁，容易引起各種急性腸炎，但欲使酸的排洩對於身體沒有害處，必須和鹼性物質中和，而變成了無刺激性的鹽，那鹼性物質的來源，除血液中供給外，便仰給於牙齒，故使牙齒變軟，但牙齒非堅硬不可，因它是咀嚼食物的利器，如果一旦變軟，那怎麼行呢？牙齒一不健全，有形成消化不良，而發生胃病，更有死亡的危險。」</p>
<p>「那麼我們怎能保護牙齒呢？」</p>
<p>「保護牙齒，對於我們的健康大有關係，如保護不得當，那後果是很可怕的，然而牙齒也有不少的缺點：（一）牙齒一部分是由琺瑯質構成，所以牙齒很堅硬，但琺瑯質遇到酸容易溶解，可是在我們嘴裹有一種能造酸的特殊微生物，所以我們很容易發生蛀牙。（二）琺瑯質一旦消耗後，永久不能自然的修補，不像身體其他部分受傷後，就能恢復原狀，於是病菌就乘機由蛀牙侵入體內，俗語說：「禍從口出，病從口入。」一些也不錯，而疾病一部也是從蛀牙而侵入。（三）牙齒生定後，不再生長，所以身體縱然發育，而牙齒仍維持原狀，所以在換牙時，須特別注意，否則牙齒排列得不整齊，便容易引起疾病。至於牙齒的保護也須注意三點：（一）應該很謹愼的選擇食物，就是多吃蔬菜和水果，一方面多晒日光。（二）應該把食物細細咀嚼，可使牙齒和頭骨發育，一方又使食物易於消化。細嚼可預防蛀牙發生，因爲咀嚼時，口中在動作，使食物沒有停留在齒面和齒隙的機會。（三）臨睡前應該把牙齒洗刷，最好在食後都要如此，但每日至少早晚洗刷二次。因在睡眠中，口腔閉塞，空氣不不通，如口中不清潔，病菌就容易繁殖，就發生蛀牙，所以多吃閒食，對於身體沒有益處，更要消耗金錢，一舉二失，那何秘自討苦吃呢？」</p>
<h3>小什錦</h3>

<p>能力小是不能負担重任，不是不能做事。能够抱住這個觀念，小朋友的本　亦就盡了。</p>

<h3>秀蘭鄧波兒自傳（十八）</h3>
<p>— 民</p>
<p>可廿，要是我把人家送給我的禮物一起保留着，那麼我們住的屋子裏都要裝得滿滿的，連住的房間都沒有了。所以我們往往拿來送到醫院或慈善機關去，給害病的和窮苦的孩子們玩。但是有一部分禮物，我却無論如何都不願意轉送給別人的。譬如耶穌復活節希　先生送與我的五頭兎子，我歡喜得什麼似的，特地在攝影塲中那所「夢屋」後面的園子裹，造起一個鐵絲網的窠來，給它們安居在內。還有傑密鄧恩送給我的一對孿生的　；至今住在那隻大玻璃缸中，我也非常寳愛，不願送人，况且它們的背上還漆着我的姓名呢。此外還有一頭鬆毛小狗勞台，是一件可愛的聖誕醴物，這些小生物，都是我平日間常常逗着它們玩的。</p>
<p>可甘，你要知道，就是你的本身，也是一件禮物啊！你在很小很小的時候，媽媽的一位好友把你送與我的。萬一我隨隨便便的把你送給別人，你的心中可覺得怎麼樣，不是要很難受嗎？至於你的名字叫做可甘，你知道是什麼意思？只爲你的頭生得圓圓的，好像一個小小的木塞子，木塞子的音是可克，所以我就叫你可甘了。</p>
<p>呀，我的玩偶們是何等的美麗，好像是許多貴婦人打扮得齊齊整整，上什麼宴會跳舞會去似的！你知道我共有多少個呢？一共二十八個，都是我最最寳愛而不願送人的。當我們遷移到新屋子裏去的時候，媽媽特地給我一間房，讓這二十八個玩偶也有一個安身之地。伊喚木匠在房中的一面壁間，造起一座玻璃櫉來，裏面分成好幾層的木架，那玩偶陳列在內，有的坐在架子上，長衣散開了，遮住它們的膝蓋，有的站立着，滿現着英挺的樣子。它們天天好像在小屋子的玻璃窗裏，向着我瞧。我也難得把它們拿出來，除非和小朋友們有什麼聚會，便拿它們出來湊湊熱鬧。倘有年長的人們到我們家裹來，我得領他們參觀我的玩偶，倘有人要瞧得子細一些，那我就不得不拿出來了。</p>
<p>我也有幾個「秀蘭鄧波兒」玩偶，它們的面目和衣服都和我十分相像！我也不知道它們學我呢，還是我學它們。另有一個橡皮質的嬰兒玩偶，它會哀聲的哭喊，又有一對彩色的玩偶，能在一根木槓上做把戲，比了我那兩位哥哥在園子裏盤槓子，要好玩得多哩。</p>
<p>我所認識的許多人中，送我禮物的最多的，要算是希漢先生了。他那最大而最好的禮物，就是攝影塲中那所名喚「夢屋」的平屋，眞使我們一家都感激得很。如今讓我來把此事的經過吿知你。我們孩子在五歲左右，一到下午，總會得昏昏欲睡的，卽使你在一部新片中工作着，兩個限睛也免不了要合攏來，所以你得磕睡一下才行。本來呢，我在工作的檯上，也可在媽媽的身十躺下來，或是在更衣室中大椅上沙　上睡一下的。但是旁邊的人，都不知道我正在磕睡，自管大聲大氣的和人講起話來：或是木匠在做佈景，敲起槌子來；或是音藥師給人練習歌唱，忽地奏起樂來。這麼一鬧，可就把我鬧醒了。</p>

<p>霍桑探案</p>
<h3>舞后的歸宿</h3>
<p>— 程小靑著</p>
<p>霍桑點了點頭，嘴脣上浮出一絲微笑。許三就押着那少年出去。霍桑不曾送出去。不一回，門外的汽車聲音響動，分明余甘棠已被押回去了。我不等霍桑坐定。便忙着向霍桑質問。</p>
<p>我道：「霍桑，那陸健生怎麼樣？我聽許三的口氣，好像他巳經走了。」</p>
<p>霍桑慢慢地坐下來，答道：「是的，那是我叫倪金壽放他走的，讓他賣一個面子。」</p>
<p>我詫異道：「這個人難道沒有關係嗎？」</p>
<p>「我想沒有——在情勢上，他不會打死王麗蘭。後來他說話時的聲音狀態，也給予我同樣的印象。」</p>
<p>「但你在警廳裏對付他那種態度，却並不和你此刻說的一致。」</p>
<p>霍桑嘴脣上的有含意的微笑又一度顯現。「那是他的那副勢利架子的反應。我想殺殺他的驕氣。你總知道我生平最厭惡勢利—階級意識！」</p>
<p>我又道：「不過他的足印又怎樣的解釋？他的那雙圓頭的皮鞋，尺寸不是和地板上的脚印相同的嗎？他雖說昨夜裹不曾進麗蘭家裏去，但他的脚印怎麼會在屍屋裏面？」</p>
<p>霍桑的笑容忽又消滅，代簪的是一種凝目皺眉的苦思神態。他頓了一頓，緩緩地說：「這個問題固然還不能解釋，不過暫時放他去也沒有關係。他也跑不了。」</p>
<p>他的眼光在書桌面上停留了好一回，忽又回過來瞧着我說：「包朗，你總也瞧見，那看門的老毛也穿着一雙皮鞋。那皮鞋雖已破舊，但也是圓頭的，尺寸似乎也不小。是不是？」（一三四）</p>

<h3>United States Southeast - Defense Works - Presidential Inspection</h3>
<p>Pittsburgh City - President Roosevelt inspected the defense work plan of the southeastern United States here yesterday. At that time, the President inadvertently stated that the American people are now working together to prepare to defend their homes and democracy when necessary. The United States' defense against foreign enemies is inseparable from improving the living conditions of the American people. (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<h3>British and American Discussions on Cooperative Forms - Imminent Expansion of Embargo Policy - US President Declares Resolution to Defend Democratic Politics - Approval for the Shipment of Machinery Parts Worth Seven Million Yuan to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Washington - People here now believe that Japan's attitude seems more moderate, and they hope that this moderation will continue, so that the tension between the United States and Japan can gradually ease. According to popular opinion, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka's remarks have obviously softened, probably in view of the very clear determination of the United States, the equally clear strength of Britain, and the form of cooperation that Britain and the United States are currently discussing. However, the section on Japan's intentions, as stated by Matsuoka, cannot deceive people. If the current situation were not so sinister, Matsuoka's words could be regarded as humorous. The German-Italian-Japanese alliance clearly stipulates that Japan must attack the United States when certain changes occur in Europe, but Matsuoka actually said that this is beneficial to the United States, which can be said to be an incomparably slick statement. Some political observers also asked, if Japan is so concerned about the possibility of plunging mankind into war, then why does it allow mankind to suffer such a catastrophe in China? The Japanese newspapers' propaganda of the US State Department as a demon is not enough to deceive people, and the Japanese Times' statement that Japan has adopted various reasonable and moderate steps has not been proven by the fact that Japan has repeatedly decided to infringe on the United States' rights and interests in the Far East. Yesterday morning, a well-known commentator said that the United States is not seeking to start a war on purpose. The cooperation between Britain and the United States has intensified the ban on supplies to Japan, and the implementation of a naval blockade does not necessarily require a naval battle. Japan must know this kind of situation, and this is probably what prompts Tokyo to worry. The position of the US authorities has not changed slightly from before. The deterioration of US-Japan relations has been going on for a long time, and it was caused by Japan's trampling on American rights and interests in the Far East. If you want to eliminate obstacles to improving relations, it lies with Japan. However, Japan's alliance with Germany is intended to deal with the United States, and it will be even more difficult to improve US-Japan relations in this way. In summary, as long as the German-Italian-Japanese alliance exists for one day, the improvement of US-Japan relations will be impossible for one day. News from several sources reporting on the state of the Dutch East Indies' ability to defend itself and its general morale has greatly excited the US authorities. President Roosevelt met with Whitney, the chairman of Pan American Airlines, yesterday and Thursday, who had just returned from a trip to the Far East, and they discussed twice. After leaving the White House, Whitney told people that the situation in Australia, New Zealand, and the Philippines all need to be discussed, and attention should be paid to the Dutch East Indies. He spoke in detail about the defense of the area. Since the beginning of this week, the US government has taken various actions to show that it has not abandoned its firm stance to reject Japan's arrogance, such as the recall of US Navy reservists, the strengthening of the garrison in Hawaii, and the advice to American expatriates in the Far East to return home. The Japanese authorities were shocked to see these significant measures coming one after another. This is something strange and is being watched by the US State Department. The gentle tone recently expressed by Suma, the Japanese government spokesperson, is very different from the aggressive remarks made after the signing of the Tripartite Pact. People here are surprised to hear this and give it the greatest reservations. At the same time, cooperation between Britain and the United States to deal with the overall situation in the Far East is still ongoing. The earliest effect of the informal contact between Britain and the United States will be the expansion of the embargo policy. All important military supplies, such as various oils and copper, will be included, and the ban on the export of scrap iron will also apply to used ironware. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt today again warned totalitarian countries, saying, "The United States is now busy preparing for war to defend democratic politics. The President gave a national address on Columbus Day, urging the American people to have strong confidence and ensure that the human progress that began with Columbus' discovery of the New World can continue to advance." The President continued, "Illegality and violence are destroying ancient European culture. China will defend it with its own strength." (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to information obtained here, three military ports and two airfields in Newfoundland will be handed over to the US government. According to well-informed sources, surveying work is currently underway, and air force and naval bases will be built next year. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Washington - The US government has approved the shipment of machine parts worth seven million yuan to the Soviet Union. At the same time, it was also heard that the US Navy Commission has approved the leasing of more than 100,000 tons of US oil tankers to the Soviet Union. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<h3>If the United States Applies Pressure, It Will Investigate and Stop Japanese Threats - General Stanley Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Philadelphia - Former US Secretary of the Navy General Stanley delivered a speech last night, supporting the proposal to send a team of US destroyers to the Far East to adopt a firm stance against Japan. He said, "Japan will act arbitrarily within the scope that does not directly engage in war with other countries. Once it encounters our opposition, it can stop its actions." General Stanley also urged that war should be declared to the Axis powers immediately, but said that he believed that if the United States could apply considerable pressure to Japan, it might be able to end "Japan's threat." He said, "If you look at the wealth and resources of the United States, what we do is absolutely no problem. Japan will definitely not dare to fight with us." He also declared that from a military point of view, the United States' long-standing doctrine of "not fighting on foreign territory" is extremely "stupid." "What will our fleet be used for? Send them to the upper reaches of the Mississippi River?" The general also said that the only thing currently isolating the United States and Hitler's attack on the Western Hemisphere is the British fleet. (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese newspapers today expressed various different reactions to the Far East policy adopted by the United States. Some newspapers condemned the United States for not putting pressure on Japan, but other newspapers predicted that the United States would not continue to support acts that threatened Japan. In general, Japanese newspapers believe that Japan is currently very "calm," which is the opposite of the "panic" attitude adopted by the US government. Local newspapers all believe that the breakdown of Japanese-American relations depends entirely on Washington. The Asahi Shimbun said that if the United States does not take "certain steps" to improve its hardening policy towards Japan, Japanese-American relations will advance to a dangerous point. The newspaper also said, "The United States must now reconsider its Far East policy regarding Japan." The newspaper continued, "The US government has recently taken several measures that are unfavorable to Japan, but we do not believe that Japan and the United States will suddenly meet with weapons." The newspaper believes that although some people in the United States strongly advocate a non-tough policy towards Japan, there is also another faction that advocates caution in dealing with Japan. The newspaper also pointed out that the US military expansion program is still in the "planning stage," so the United States does not seem to be likely to have a military conflict with Japan. (United Press Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<h3>War Sentiment Between the United States and Japan - Spreads in Washington Officialdom - Senator Wheeler Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>Washington - War sentiment is now spreading in Washington officialdom. Senator Wheeler of the "Liberal Party" of Montana suggested that the United States and Japan should jointly discuss avoiding war under the Kellogg-Briand Pact. He said that it is still possible to end the manipulation of the world by communists. He also reiterated his warning of September 12 that the United States and Japan are on the verge of war. He continued, "If the United States participates in the war, the Soviet Union and the communists will be the only winners." A Washington official with the most informed sources said that he believed that there was a great reason to believe that a war would break out within two months. Another official told reporters that the US-Japan war would break out on October 17, the day Britain reopens the Yunnan-Burma Road. Washington officialdom is divided into several groups on the war issue. One faction believes that war is now inevitable, and the United States should take advantage of the fact that Japan is busy in China and that Britain can provide the United States with full military assistance to immediately declare war on Japan. The second faction believes that war is still possible but not necessary. They pointed out that the war was provoked for the benefit of Britain. The third faction opposes the war and believes that Japan, even if it obtains guarantees of assistance from the Axis powers, will automatically back down before threatening Britain and the United States with war. Senator Wheeler also said, "I believe we are now going to war with Japan. If we fight with Japan, because of Japan's alliance, we will be fighting in both Europe and Asia at the same time. This war will be a long-term war. In addition to the loss of life, the American people will also sacrifice billions of dollars. Regardless of whether the war is won or extended, it will cause inflation, followed by deflation, which will be a worse collapse than in 1929. I do not believe that Japan wants to go to war with the United States. If we stop buying its silk and stop selling it munitions and cotton, the Japanese economy will collapse immediately. So what is the reason for the United States to join the war? When Japan bombed US warships in the Yangtze River and killed American sailors, we did not declare war on Japan. Now, because of the foolish intimidation of this area and Japan, we are going to declare war on Japan?" Senator Wheeler urged Congress and the American people to proceed cautiously and prevent war sentiment. He also said, "If you want to invoke the Kellogg-Briand Pact, now is the time." He concluded, "This move can give both countries time to calm down and avoid a catastrophe." (International News Agency Dispatch of the 12th)</p>

<h3>"Showing Your Hand" and "Gambling with National Fate"</h3>
<p>Is today's international situation a contest of strength? Or is it a battle of wits? It is most like a game of poker; the bluffer keeps raising the stakes, trying to scare off the opponent, but who knows that the opponent does not show weakness, and insists on comparing strength: because the stakes are so high, who would blindly give up? In the end, the only thing to do is for each other to show all the cards in their hands, and fight for a win or loss, this is called "showing your hand" (Show-Uown). An American commentator said that the current situation in the Far East has moved towards the path of "showing your hand," which is an appropriate metaphor.</p>
<p>Japan's joining the Tripartite Pact is nothing more than to strengthen its own momentum and scare off Britain and the United States. It fully intends that the US Roosevelt government will not have any major actions before the primary election on November 5 of this year, so the alliance is not enough, and it is followed by direct provocations from Konoe and Matsuoka, thinking that the United States will definitely retreat in the face of difficulties; if the United States retreats, Britain will naturally follow suit; then, relying on this paper alliance, it will coerce the Soviet Union, and then force China to submit in one fell swoop, and then dominate Southeast Asia in one fell swoop, this is just the beginning of a preliminary ambition. Who knows that the evolution of facts and the shift of reactions are completely opposite; the United States is not only not retreating, but advancing; not only is it advancing itself, but also Britain is advancing together: so on one side, Britain announced the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road, and strengthened the defenses of Singapore and Australia; on the other side, the United States is preparing to withdraw expatriates from the Far East and actively complete military deployments, "war sentiment suddenly spread in Washington officialdom" (International News Agency Dispatch of the 12th). Although the content of the meeting between Secretary of State Hull and Japanese Ambassador Horinouchi on the 9th of this month has not been leaked, judging from the "pretended calmness" of the Japanese spokesperson and the "repeated explanations" of Yosuke Matsuoka in the past two or three days, at least it can be imagined that Hull's warning was very serious.</p>
<p>Japan's arrogance was so aggressive in the days after the signing of the Tripartite Pact, but the multi-faceted explanations in the past two days were so gentle, arrogant before and respectful afterwards, no wonder world public opinion is saying that Japan has softened. Of course, this softening may be a diplomatic strategy, a military delaying tactic: waiting for the situation to change, or when it is favorable to Japan, to harden again; however, as far as the current situation is concerned, at least it can be said that Japan's false intimidation has hit the top, otherwise, why would it shrink back when it comes to "showing your hand"?</p>
<p>Anyone with a little foresight knows that Japan's collusion with Germany and Italy is more ominous than auspicious; even in Japan, there are many insightful people who are deeply worried about this. To put it bluntly, Germany and Italy's interests are inconsistent with Japan's. Germany and Italy are not afraid of offending the United States at all, and they even wish that Japan and the United States would go to war, so as to reduce the United States' assistance to Britain. Therefore, if the United States and Japan go to war, Germany and Italy will get what they want. As for the aid clauses stipulated in the alliance, in today's situation where the Tripartite Technical Committee has not yet achieved concrete results, that is really only known to God. As for Japan, it is completely different, because before the alliance, Japan considered it best to sit on the fence, on the one hand, it could obtain momentum support from Germany and Italy, and on the other hand, it could extort some practical benefits from Britain and the United States. Now, the situation is completely different, even if it does not have to "pull chestnuts out of the fire" for Germany and Italy, it has to struggle in a siege, and its life and death are unknown. Think about it, Japan has been fighting against China for more than three years, and it is already exhausted. How can it withstand confrontation with Britain and the United States? Even if the Sino-Japanese war is counted as one-on-one, with the United States' existing naval and air force strength, and its potential to build ships and aircraft, compared with Japan, which was originally poor and has been exhausted for three years, it is almost a one-to-five situation. So even if the British Far East forces are left out of the equation—its military facilities in the Far East, such as the Singapore naval base, and its power resources, such as India and Australia, are of course still very important—Japan's confrontation with China and the United States is equivalent to one against six; with such unequal strength, if there are no other reliable helpers, how can it "show its hand"? Some people say that the US naval and air force bases are too far away, which is extremely unfavorable for fighting against Japan, and this certainly has considerable reason; however, there is also one point that must be paid attention to, and that is the realization of the British-American-Australian joint defense. If this is achieved, it will undoubtedly at least remedy most of the geographical deficiencies; moreover, today's United States is no longer the United States of September last year, it has experienced many new tactics in this European war; inevitably, it can also use many new weapons; with the United States' industrial equipment and economic strength, adding thousands of aircraft or hundreds of submarines does not seem to require much time, which is something that Japan can never hope to achieve. Coupled with the power of the economic blockade, this is even more something that the Japanese business community is terrified of. Furthermore, from a purely strategic point of view, the United States is not without a solution; according to a recent British officer, if Japan and the United States go to war, the United States should use Hawaii as a fleet base and the Philippines as an air force base; the general strategy is to use aircraft to bomb Japan. If Japan advances south, it must transfer its fleet from its home country, at which time the US fleet stationed in Hawaii should take advantage of the weakness and enter directly into the Japanese mainland; if the Japanese fleet does not move, then in addition to bombing, the blockade should be tightened, and it may as well sit and wait for Japan to run dry. This view is indeed quite insightful. In any case, if Japan truly softens from now on, it will not fail to be a clever and pragmatic person; otherwise, it will be seen as a bluffer who throws himself into a trap; and finally has to give up after others have caught the chicken. The Japanese authorities themselves said "gambling with the national fate," which is probably the intention of using the remaining strength to make a desperate bet because there is no way to cheat!</p>

<h3>The Yunnan-Burma Road Reopens - Transportation Capacity Will Be Enhanced - Roadbeds, Bridges, and Tunnels Have All Been Improved - Fueling Stations and Repair Shops Will Be Added Along the Road</h3>
<p>Chongqing - A spokesperson for the Ministry of Communications said that when the Burma Road reopens on October 18, the total transportation capacity will be increased. In the past three months, China has improved the roadbeds, bridges, and tunnels. If more trucks are obtained, the number of 300 tons of goods transported daily in peacetime can be expected to increase. The authorities expect that there will be no shortage of kerosene supply, because China can import important fuel from overseas through the Yunnan-Burma Road. Fueling stations and repair shops will be added along the road. The Ministry of Communications will set up a general office in Kunming to maintain and improve this road and to direct freight operations. Since the Japanese have occupied French Vietnam, China is now relying on the Burma Road to export tung oil, the collateral for three US loans. According to the Chinese Post Office announcement, except for air mail, ordinary mail from foreign countries will now be transported by the Burma Road to avoid obstruction and inspection by the Japanese. Special oil trucks are now being sent to the Burma Road to carry light mail, while heavier items are carried by other trucks. The Post Office has established several postal stations along the road to facilitate the use of the Burma Road. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Tseng Yung-fu, China's representative in Yangon, recently returned to China to report on the latest situation in Burma to the government. Now that he has finished his business, he took a plane back to his post in Yangon today. According to what Tseng told a Reuters interviewer, the situation on the Burma Road is very good. Although the past three months have been the rainy season, there was only one interruption for six hours due to a landslide. There are three reasons for this good result: the weather is very good, the roadbed is gradually hardening, and the constant efforts of the Chinese and Burmese authorities to improve the road. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Lashio - According to sources in Kunming, the Chinese government is said to be considering prohibiting all private and commercial vehicles on the Burma Road for a period of three months starting from October 18 to avoid excessive traffic congestion and hinder military transportation. Only trucks with special permits are allowed to travel on the Chinese territory of the road. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The Central Daily News published an article today criticizing the British action of reopening the Burma Road, saying that the significance of this move is twofold: (1) It represents Britain's abandonment of its appeasement policy in the Far East; (2) It shows that Britain and the United States have a complete understanding of their parallel actions in the Far East. The newspaper also pointed out the greatness of Britain's ability to correct its mistakes, saying that it is a mistake to interpret Britain's conservatism as a symbol of weakness. Once Britain has decided its will, it will watch it achieve its goal. The newspaper concluded by saying that the clouds that have shrouded the Pacific for the past three years have disappeared due to China's three-year resistance war and the recent actions of Britain and the United States. (Reuters Dispatch of the 12th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Tseng Yung-fu, who has been engaged in matters related to trade issues in Yangon for two years, came to Chongqing on official business and will return to Yangon soon. Today, he made a statement saying that the central officials of the Burmese government are sincerely cooperating with China and assisting China in solving the transportation problems of the Burmese Road. Tseng said that China is delighted with Britain's decision to reopen the Burmese Road, and that Britain's action is a subtle shift in its policy. Officials in the transportation industry said that transportation will increase sharply after the road is opened on October 18, because the two sections of the road in China have been greatly improved during the three-month blockade, and guards have been added to the bridges and tunnels.

<h3>German Troops Invade the Balkans - Turkey's Position is Important - Strong Military with Determination to Defend Territory - Axis Powers' Pincer Movement Faces Significant Obstacles</h3>
<p>London – A Reuters military correspondent reports that while there is significant troop movement in the Balkans, it is premature to say that the Axis powers have taken concrete action. Germany is currently using intimidation as a prelude. Very little reliable news is coming from the Balkans. The Germans are deliberately stopping normal diplomatic news while spreading rumors of military occupation and impending military developments. These rumors originate from the German side, not neutral sources. They suggest that Germany will attack Egypt and the Suez Canal via the Balkans instead of Libya. However, such an offensive faces significant difficulties. Examining a map, advancing through Turkey to seize Syria and Palestine would be a large-scale operation that cannot be taken lightly. However, we know from our experience with France that Hitler is capable of lightning-fast actions and that his troops are willing to attempt seemingly impossible feats. Boldness is a major factor in warfare, so such unexpected actions cannot be ruled out entirely. General Graziani's Italian troops in Libya have been preparing for some time and outnumber the British forces. Even without a pincer movement from the left, they are in a position to attack. The recently announced black pincer line in Southeast Europe and North Africa is misleading and has no military relevance, as it completely ignores high mountains, steep ridges, and deep rivers. The long-discussed German left-wing pincer movement's route is also problematic. From the Bulgarian border to Aleppo in Syria is 650 miles, and from Aleppo to Haifa in Palestine is over 300 miles, traversing difficult terrain. One might ask why Hitler would advance thousands of miles through such treacherous terrain when Graziani's Italian troops are only 250 miles from Alexandria. Could it be that Hitler believes Turkey can be intimidated as easily as Czechoslovakia, requiring no bloodshed? Otherwise, there is no other explanation. However, Turkey is the largest and strongest country in Southeast Europe, and would not allow enemy troops to approach without resistance. Turkey is the leader of the Balkan Entente, occupies the most strategic terrain, and its straits are the gateway to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, as well as a vital link between Europe and Asia. Turkey has a peacetime army of 26 divisions, which can be doubled at any time. Its army includes some mechanized units, but the terrain is not suitable for them. Therefore, viewed from the perspective of German military strategists who seek to achieve their objectives quickly and efficiently, Germany's theoretical pincer movement is unlikely to be considered feasible.

<h3>German Aircraft Demonstrate Over Romanian Capital - British-Romanian Relations on the Verge of Collapse - British Ambassador Urges Romania to Explain the Truth of the Situation - And Advises Nationals to Evacuate from Danger</h3>
<p>Romanian Capital – Last night, as the British Embassy here prepared to leave Romania, the sky over the Romanian capital was filled with a total of 150 German and Romanian bombers and fighter planes. The planes flew very low, appearing to be a deliberate show of force. However, most of the planes flew towards the Ploiesti oil region. Several German air force commanders arrived at the same time, seemingly confirming reports that a squadron of German air force units had been ordered to enter Romania. Some neutral observers believe that the purpose of last night's aerial demonstration was to pressure the British Embassy to withdraw. The embassy is currently awaiting orders from London. Six high-ranking German air force officers arrived here yesterday afternoon, all in uniform. They arrived on a special train and were welcomed by Iron Guard leader and Deputy Prime Minister Horia Sima, other Romanian leaders and cabinet ministers, the German and Italian ambassadors, and the Spanish and Japanese envoys. Romanian officials solemnly declared last night that the entry of German troops and aircraft into Romania was to ensure "the safety of defense, not aggression." Reliable sources reported last night that half of the British Embassy staff may leave here today for Istanbul. (12th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>London – British government officials stated last night that after receiving news that a large number of German aircraft had arrived in Romania, Britain's diplomatic relations with Romania were on the verge of collapse. It is said that the government has authorized the British Ambassador to Romania, Sir Reginald Hoare, to decide at any time to sever relations with Romania. It is also learned that Ambassador Hoare has told Romanian Prime Minister Ion Antonescu that Anglo-Romanian relations have reached a most dangerous point as a result of the large number of German army and air force units entering Romania, and Romania's repeated mistreatment of British nationals.

<p>Budapest – Hungarian newspapers yesterday carried a dispatch from Bucharest stating that Hungarian-Romanian negotiations on the issue of Romania ceding territory to Hungary have stalled. The dispatches in all newspapers were identical and read as follows: "The committee appointed after the Vienna Arbitration has been conducting negotiations in Budapest for some time. However, a sudden change has occurred in the committee's work. The Romanian government has maintained contact with the German and Italian governments regarding these negotiations. Therefore, we believe that the negotiations between Romania and Hungary have now stalled." (12th Haitong Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Budapest – A communiqué here announced that the Hungarian government has called on the Axis powers to intervene in the disputes between Hungary and Romania. Romania's proposal to establish a mixed committee to investigate the treatment of minorities has been rejected, as the experience of the past 22 years has proven that such committees are not only ineffective but also a source of incidents. The Hungarian government hopes to restore normal relations between the two countries as soon as possible. It is generally believed here that the Axis powers' intervention may lead to a further expansion of the measures already taken by Germany in Hungary. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

This was the first large-scale offensive by the British since the evacuation of Dunkirk. The Admiralty also stated, "All warships, large and small, participated in the bombardment of Cherbourg. According to the communiqué, the explosions of our shells in the enemy's positions were clearly visible. As our warships set sail to return to defense, 40 miles away, we still saw countless huge fires rising into the sky from the enemy positions. Our navy encountered no resistance on the way to Cherbourg or during the bombardment. On our return, we were subjected to intense retaliatory fire from enemy fortifications, but there were no casualties." (12th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>German Aircraft Active Day and Night - London Suffers Another Devastating Bombing</p>
<p>London – Thirty-five districts in the London area and twelve districts in the British coastal area were subjected to heavy bombing by German aircraft until 2:00 AM today (10:00 AM Shanghai Summer Time). Before 12:40 AM, 18 districts in the Metropolitan area had been bombed. In one street, a bomb killed one civilian and caused a gas pipe to rupture and catch fire. Firefighters immediately rushed to extinguish the fire. In another location, a high-explosive bomb destroyed part of a church and damaged a youth association building. Several other buildings were also destroyed. According to the British air defense authorities, the anti-aircraft fire last night was so intense that it forced German aircraft to fly higher than usual, preventing them from coming down. By midnight, eight German aircraft had been shot down, and eight British aircraft had also been lost. However, six airmen escaped by parachute. As German aircraft scattered over London to carry out the air raids, 20 other German bombers flew into Britain from elsewhere and attacked Liverpool twice. In addition to dropping heavy bombs, they also dropped time bombs. During the city's second air raid, a hotel was hit and destroyed, and guests and staff were almost buried alive. Fortunately, rescuers quickly rushed from nearby buildings into the hotel's basement and rescued the guests and staff who had taken refuge there. A town in the northeast was attacked six times last night, but it was reported that the German aircraft were driven away after dropping a large number of bombs, all of which reportedly fell into the sea. Furthermore, according to an official announcement, during the German air raid on Thursday night, a train heading for London ran into a crater previously created by a German bomb, causing two carriages to derail. However, there were no casualties among the passengers. German aircraft continued to drop countless flares over London last night, and the intensity of British anti-aircraft fire was unusually high. Anti-aircraft fire along the Thames River began yesterday afternoon when German aircraft crossed the Kent region to attack. The German aircraft that attacked London initially flew hidden in the clouds, heading directly for London, before being obstructed by British fighter aircraft. After a brief but intense dogfight in the high altitude, the German aircraft turned back towards the coast and fled. (12th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Air Force Conducts Night Raids - Heavy Bombing of German Oil Production Areas - Flames Soar Where Bombs Fall - Dutch and French Coasts Also Attacked</h3>
<p>London – British Air Force bombers continued to attack key military locations in Germany on Thursday, day and night, focusing on the German oil supply centers according to plan. The targets of the separate attacks by British aircraft included seven oil-producing areas: Hamburg, Hanover, Cologne, Magdeburg, Gelsenkirchen, Ruhland, and Lützkendorf. The large oil refineries in these areas, which have a combined oil production capacity of 1.5 million tons and are vital to the German war machine, are believed to have suffered extensive damage. British aircraft launched the most significant attack on the Rhenania oil refinery near Hamburg, dropping tons of high-explosive bombs and hundreds of incendiary bombs on the refinery and adjacent oil storage buildings over a period of one and a half hours. According to the last British aircrew to leave the area, the Rhenania oil refinery was engulfed in flames and burning, with a total of eight fires. The refinery has an annual production capacity of 400,000 tons of high-grade lubricating oil. According to the Air Ministry's information office, the explosions and fires at other oil refineries after being attacked were similar to those described above. The attacking British aircraft encountered fierce resistance, but braved intense anti-aircraft fire and flew low to ensure accurate bombing. The large oil refinery in Hanover was hit by multiple high-explosive bombs. When British aircraft attacked the Moersburg oil refinery near Ruhland, they first dropped flares to locate it. The refinery has 140 buildings and an annual production capacity of 1.5 million tons of gasoline. Other targets that were heavily bombed included railway hubs in Germany, shipyards and aircraft factories in Amsterdam, and airfields inside Germany and the Netherlands. The ports used by the Germans to prepare for the invasion of Britain were also attacked, with Le Havre, Cherbourg, Calais, and Boulogne being the most heavily bombed. A British bomber, returning from a night raid, flew over the Netherlands and shot down a German aircraft. On Thursday, British coastal aircraft attacked the Dutch coast from Den Helder to Boulogne, Le Havre, and Brest, with coastal areas along the English Channel being targeted. Among them, a German destroyer in the port of Brest was bombed for the second consecutive night. British aircraft braved difficult weather conditions and anti-aircraft fire to drop heavy bombs on the German warship. It was reported that several bombs hit, and the onshore workshops and warehouses were also severely damaged. Three explosions occurred at the shipyard in Den Helder, and the pier was also hit, causing fires in buildings. The British aircrew who attacked Boulogne saw bombs exploding among 30 or 40 small boats, and the British aircrew who attacked Le Havre found the dock obscured by fog, and carried out accurate bombing on a basin.

<h3>Japan Attacking Singapore - Will Face Major Difficulties - United States Closely Monitoring the Situation in Shanghai - Soviet Union Will Maintain Neutrality and Continue to Aid China</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Military experts here believe that Japan will face major difficulties in attacking Singapore by land or sea. Therefore, it is unlikely that they will attempt to attack the port. If the Japanese take action, it will likely be initiated in Shanghai first, as it is believed that Britain and the United States will not resist there. It is rumored that Japan covets the East Indies and wants to seize them. If so, Japan must act quickly, or its warships will be subject to a flank attack by the US fleet. Well-informed sources claim that British troops withdrawn from China and a large contingent of Australian troops have arrived in Singapore, significantly strengthening the British garrison there. It is generally believed that Britain's announcement of the reopening of the Burma Road is a form of resistance to Japan. Japan will take no action on this. However, if Japan has no countermeasures, its current cabinet will inevitably fall. It is also possible that Japan, under the secret terms of the German-Italian-Japanese pact, has an obligation to take certain steps. Xinhua Daily states that the Soviet Union will not join any belligerent side but will continue to provide assistance to China. The Soviet Union will adhere to its neutral policy, unaffected by the Tripartite Pact or any external forces. (12th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>American Newspaper Suggests Forming an Alliance to Aid China Against Japan</h3>
<p>New York - A New York dispatch today carried an editorial stating that the current aim of American Far Eastern policy is to maintain the status quo in the Far East. Therefore, the powers with interests in the Far Eastern status quo should unite and form a non-totalitarian Pacific League with two objectives: (1) If Japan reveals an adventurous expansionist will, the member powers should declare to Japan their interests in the status quo and support it with economic pressure. (2) Declare their interests and provide China with all possible assistance except for participating in the war. The newspaper also listed the countries related to the Pacific status quo, including China, France, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Malaya, the Netherlands, Portugal, and the United States.

<h3>Konoe Admits Encountering Serious Difficulties</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe declared here today that Japan is currently encountering the greatest turning point in its history, requiring nationwide cooperation to achieve Japan's goal of establishing a "New Order in East Asia." According to his speech at the founding meeting of the National Service Association, Japan is currently in a period as serious and critical as the Meiji Restoration. The National Service Association is an organization selected by the government to promote a new national structure, the purpose of which is to promote friendly relations with neighboring countries and to establish a "New Order" in East Asia. Konoe also stated that the new national structure will enable all people to serve the country, and the old individualism must be eliminated. Indeed, the fate of Japan depends entirely on the realization of the new national structure. Although the new movement has many thorns ahead, no matter what difficulties are encountered, our national policy must clear the waves and not stop until the goal is achieved.

<h3>A Brief History of German Air Force Construction</h3>
<p>Of equal significance to the number of aircraft is the way in which the German army uses aircraft. The German army has always used aircraft as a tool for offensive operations, so its construction concentrated its efforts on manufacturing bombers. In terms of effectiveness, this type of aircraft is equivalent to the German army's long-range artillery, carrying shells hundreds of miles away and then firing them into the enemy's ranks. According to German claims, the accuracy of the bombing is unmatched even by the most highly trained artillery. The most accurate bombing is undoubtedly carried out by dive bombers, the inventors of which were originally Americans, and are in fact the most terrible of modern killing weapons.</p>
<p>The function of fighter planes is to protect German territory from external attacks. Recently, German fighter planes have also been covering bombers in attacks on England. Originally, fighter planes were an auxiliary to bombers, with their greatest function being defense. Since the German army captured the Netherlands, Belgium, and France, the airfields occupied by the German army are very close to England, so short-range fighter planes can also cover bombers in attacks on the British Isles.</p>
<p>In addition to fighter planes, the German army has also added a type of "destruction" aircraft, whose function is to be able to attack and defend over long distances. The twin-engine Messerschmitt 110, which can carry two pilots, is the best of these aircraft. This aircraft has twice the firepower of a fighter plane, equipped with four machine guns and two small cannons. It can stay in the air for four hours, while ordinary fighter planes can only fly for an hour and a half.</p>
<p>The best of the German bombers is the Heinkel 111. German aircraft attacking England use this type of aircraft, with a long range of often up to 1,000 miles. Today, whether for long-range or short-range bombing, the German army mainly uses the Heinkel type as its mainstay. The Heinkel fuselage is lighter, enabling rapid flight with heavy loads. According to the 1939 German Aviation Yearbook, the Heinkel's top speed is 315 miles per hour, its range is 1,875 miles, and its payload is 2,000 kilograms. It is equipped with three mobile machine guns and can carry four people. The light bombers are the Dornier 17 and Dornier 215, which are mostly used for reconnaissance. Their speed is similar to that of the Heinkel, but their payload and range are far inferior. The payload is 1,000 kilograms and the range is 1,600 miles.</p>
<p>The Junkers 87 dive bomber is the latest weapon in the German Air Force. Its dive speed is 500 miles per hour and it can carry 250 kg or 500 kg of bombs, which explode within 600 yards of the target, destroying even tanks or trains in motion. The bombs are mounted between the wheels, and the Y-shaped knobs are a characteristic of this aircraft.</p>
<p>Dive bombers fly in a straight line when diving, using the entire fuselage as a guide for the bomb. The pilot's windshield is equipped with a sight for observation. The rear of the fuselage is equipped with a mobile machine gun, and the wings have one or two fixed or mobile machine guns. Five months ago, the Germans claimed that the Messerschmitt 110 was the fastest aircraft in the world. The German army uses this type of aircraft for all its air raids. Its top speed is 450 miles per hour. It is equipped with four machine guns or two machine guns and one small cannon. Last spring, the Germans declared that the maneuverability of the Heinkel 113 fighter plane was better than that of the Messerschmitt, but in reality, the Messerschmitt is still the outstanding weapon in the German Air Force's fighter planes.</p>
<p>These six different types of aircraft are in fact the first-line soldiers of the German Air Force. Most other types of aircraft are used for training. The main air force weapons are only these six types, so in manufacturing, operation, and maintenance, they tend to be standardized, which can achieve twice the result with half the effort. Standardized manufacturing not only allows for the mass production of several of the most effective aircraft, but also provides great convenience in the configuration of parts and in repairs. Today, the ones fighting to the death in the air with British aircraft are also the above-mentioned six types of aircraft, and the highest military authorities commanding their operations are the aforementioned four generals, Goering, Milch, etc. The power of aircraft to surpass the navy has yet to be proven, and even if it is delayed to another day, it may not be easy to find the most reasonable solution. However, since the German army crossed the Strait and launched a large-scale air raid on England, both the Germans and the British know that whoever has air superiority will have maritime superiority.

<h3>American Businessman in Tianjin Urges Restrictions on Japan-U.S. Trade</h3>
<p>Tianjin - The American Chamber of Commerce in Tianjin this week suggested that the American government impose the same restrictions on Japanese trade with the United States as Japan imposes on American businesses in China. In a lengthy document submitted to the State Department, the American Chamber of Commerce severely criticized Japan for destroying American commerce by monopolizing various industries and making it difficult for American businesses to apply for customs documents. It specifically requested the government to impose restrictions on Japanese businesses until Japan abandons its monopolistic policy in North China. The document also stated that Japanese troops often set any price to force American businesses to sell goods to Japan. Sometimes the price is so low that it is tantamount to confiscating American businesses' goods. In addition, Japanese officials in North China often conduct unnecessary inspections of American businesses' private property. Furthermore, Japanese merchant ships also particularly discriminate against American businesses' goods. (Associated Press, 12th)</p>

<p>Bangkok - The French Boundary Commission will come here before the end of this month to discuss Thailand's territorial demands on Vietnam. Because France has repeatedly formally declared that it does not recognize Thailand's territorial demands, the news that the French Commission will come here has caused very mixed feelings among people here. At the same time, the Thai government is doing its best to suppress the people's emotions and not make overly hasty public demands for the revision of the boundary. Thai students still held demonstrations yesterday. The Deputy Minister of Education, Palayong, also gave a speech yesterday, urging students to remain calm and self-possessed. Palayong also solemnly declared that when it is necessary to revise the boundary between Thailand and Vietnam, the Thai authorities will use force, but it is the duty of students to strictly observe discipline. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Bangkok - According to an official announcement here yesterday, the French government has refused to discuss Thailand's request for land west of the Mekong River. The reasons for the rejection are: (1) According to the treaty signed in 1907, France and Thailand both declared that they would no longer make demands for land. (2) In June, the French government agreed to discuss the issue of some islands in the Mekong River, and Thailand had already guaranteed not to make land demands. (3) In view of recent developments, the French government must guarantee the political status and territorial integrity of Vietnam, reject all demands, and resist any aggression. The conclusion of the document stated that the Thai government is rectifying and measuring this matter. (Haitong News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The Bangkok correspondent of the Nichinichi Shimbun said that Thailand has concentrated troops and a large number of aircraft in the Phantipopri area on the Vietnamese border because Vietnam refused to return land.

<h3>National National Physical Education Conference Holds First Plenary Meeting in the Accompanying Capital, Local Reports on Physical Education Overview Review Proposals</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 11th Dispatch) The National National Physical Education Conference held its first plenary meeting at 8:00 this morning in the accompanying capital, chaired by Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education. In addition to discussing agenda items and reviewing rules, it also passed a list of group review personnel, and then listened to reports from all parties. First, Hao Gengsheng, chairman of the Physical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, reported on the work of the committee. Hao gave a brief account of the organization of physical education administration, the training of physical education teachers, school physical education, social physical education, health physical education, and the improvement of school military training. He concluded that physical education laws and regulations still need to be enriched and revised, and a large number of cadres and talents need to be cultivated to meet the needs of all parties. School physical education should be gradually improved in accordance with the programs promulgated by the Ministry. Mass physical education cannot be solely borne by physical education venues and must find other ways. Therefore, the use of national and central schools is a problem worthy of consideration. Physical education textbooks must be changed in accordance with current practical needs, and attention should be paid to the applied technology of water, land, and air. It is hoped that experts and physical education teacher training institutions will study this in depth. Representatives from the education departments of Jiangxi, Fujian, Shaanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Guizhou, and Chahar provinces, Yu Yongzuo, Guo Yuntan, Zhuang Wenxiang, Li Jingyao, Shang Cunmei, Chen Guisen, Jiang Rongshu, and Wang Shutang, successively reported on the overview of physical education promotion in various places. Zhang Zhijiang, director of the Central Guoshu Museum, also gave an impromptu report on the work of the museum. Zhang Qianglin, representative of the Aviation Committee, elaborated on (the Air Force and Physical Education), saying that the Air Force is 100% from schools, and is composed of students who love and pay attention to physical education. The representative teams of various sports in Air Force schools are the most heroic, and their casualty rate is as high as 85% or more. From this, it can be seen that the Air Force especially needs physical education, and at the same time, the Air Force especially needs physical education cadres. After the reports from all parties were completed, the meeting adjourned at noon. In the afternoon, at 2:00, the group review of proposals began. The administrative group was convened by Yuan Dunli and Guo Youshou, the teacher group was convened by Xu Benzhen and Jin Zhaojun, the school group was convened by Li Jie and John Ma, the social group was convened by Pan Gongzhan and Wu Yunrui, and the other proposal groups were convened by Zhang Zhijiang and Jin Baoshan. Each group reviewed each course proposal separately until dusk before the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Minister He's Speech (Chongqing, 12th Dispatch) The National National Physical Education Conference held its second general meeting on the 12th morning. Minister He Yingqin attended and gave a speech, elaborating on the relationship between national physical education training and military affairs, and the experience of feeling that the national physique was insufficient in the early stage of the war of resistance. He also hoped that all parties would have practical and concrete measures for national physical education in the future to promote the great cause of the war of resistance. Next, representatives from the Military Training Department, the Ministry of Military Affairs, and the Political Department reported on the current situation of physical education facilities and the plans for promotion in the future. It was also decided that the directors and inspectors of the education departments of each province and city should report on the implementation of physical education in various places.

<h3>Finance Currency Market Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation saw HSBC's listed prices unchanged. The unofficial market for British and American currencies was mediocre throughout the half-day, lacking any excitement. This was due to the weekend, with operators showing little interest in buying or selling. As a result, British currency, due to low demand, closed at 3 shillings 8.125 pence. The US dollar weakened slightly to 5.84375 yuan, causing the British-American exchange rate in the local market to reach a small difference of 3.067 yuan.</p>
<p>Sterling Stable, USD Slightly Tight</p>
<p>In the early morning, London large bars were quoted at 0.625 for near-term, with no change for forward dates. New York silver prices remained stable, and London spot gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies was stable, with a slight increase of 0.125 against Shanghai. The US dollar remained unchanged against the British pound, with a slight decrease of 0.07 against Shanghai. Central Bank listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened for spot sales in the morning, with British currency at 3 shillings 8.125 pence, and US currency at 5.875 yuan, showing no significant change compared to the previous closing prices. After the opening, foreign sellers showed weak interest, and the market softened slightly. British currency was available for settlement at 3 shillings 7.96875 pence, and US currency at 5.84375 yuan, but transactions were few. HSBC's listed prices were announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced with an increase of 0.5 pence. Subsequently, Chinese banks suddenly released supply, and the market slightly eased. Approximately US$5.84375 yuan for October delivery was sold to speculators, followed by the American bank Chase and Chinese banks in Shanghai releasing US$5.875 yuan for the current month. At that time, spot British currency was difficult to settle or sell at 3 shillings 8.28125 pence, while US currency was available for settlement at 5.875 yuan. However, the selling pressure soon dissipated, and speculators continued to buy in, leading to a renewed tendency for the market to soften. However, British currency remained stable due to lack of demand. The closing prices were 3 shillings 8.125 pence for British currency and 5.84375 yuan for US currency. The November quotations were 3 shillings 7.96875 pence for British currency and 5.8125 yuan for US currency. Consequently, compared to the previous day, spot British currency was stable, and US currency was 0.03125 yuan tighter. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Hong Kong USD Weakens</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 12th (Saturday) Dispatch: The currency market opened this morning with the British pound stable and the US dollar slightly tighter. Spot and forward prices for the British pound were unchanged, and spot prices for the Japanese yen were also unchanged. Spot US dollar weakened by 0.0625 to 23.0625 yuan (yesterday's closing price was 23.125 yuan). Spot Shanghai currency rose by 5 yuan to 393 yuan. The market tightened slightly at 9:15 AM, with spot US dollar continuing to weaken by 0.0625 to 23 yuan. The market was reported tight at 9:25 AM, with spot US dollar weakening further by 0.125 to 22.875 yuan. The market was reported stable at 9:55 AM, with spot US dollar rebounding by 0.0625 to 22.9375 yuan. Spot Shanghai currency decreased by 2 yuan to 391 yuan. The market was stable at 11:30 AM, with spot Shanghai currency continuing to decrease by 2 yuan to 389 yuan. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rate Increases</p>
<p>Tianjin, 12th (Saturday) Dispatch: The currency market opened this morning with a stable report. The exchange rates for telegraphic transfers of British and American currencies each eased by 0.0625. The British currency was 3 shillings 0.625 pence, and the American currency was 5.625 yuan. The telegraphic code for Shanghai currency is unclear. The unofficial market for "Joint Banknotes" continued to rise by 2.25 yuan to 76.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Market Stable with Firm Undertones</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold market was stable amidst opposing buying and selling pressures. The fluctuations were quite narrow during the half-day, as the currency market had entered a state of consolidation, and gold prices followed suit. The morning opening price was a high of 5,590 yuan, as the US dollar was reported tight. However, money changers began selling short, and gold shops also sold, causing the price to fall to a low of 5,550 yuan. Before the close, due to a slight tightening in the currency market, securities firms and banks competed to buy in, resulting in a closing price of 5,580 yuan. Consequently, the price increased by 10 yuan compared to the previous day. There was no market in the afternoon due to Saturday. Most of the over 3,000 taels traded during the half-day were for squaring positions and closing out. Jewelry gold shops and customs gold were reported stable.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Increases by Ten Yuan</p>
<p>The market opened firm in the early morning, with prices 20 yuan higher than the previous day. Gold shops entered with money changers at 20 yuan, to 5,590 yuan. Subsequently, a certain money changer took advantage of the high prices to sell short, and cash gold shops followed suit, causing the market to turn downstream and fall back to 5,560 yuan. Then, with the help of some securities firms buying in, the price rose again to 5,570 yuan. However, a certain gold shop suddenly began selling heavily, causing buyers to stand aside, and the price fell to a low of 5,550 yuan. Fortunately, a certain money changer covered his short positions to make a profit, and securities firms and banks added to their long positions, causing the price to rise sharply to 5,585 yuan. At noon, buyers decreased, and money changers and small longs sold out, causing the price to fall again to 5,575 yuan. However, the closing price was 5,580 yuan, resulting in an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. The underlying trend after the close was initially down and then up. The initial price was as low as 5,570 yuan, but securities firms bought in, raising the price back to 5,585 yuan. Fluctuations of 40 yuan occurred during the half-day. The selling price of cash gold shops was over 10 yuan higher than the cash gold quote, while the buying price was 30 yuan lower. Spot gold was 50-60 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and few transactions were made.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael remained unchanged. Datong Bank still quoted 570 yuan, and the new bank quoted the same price, with a reduction of about 30 yuan for buying in.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Increased Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw cash gold fluctuate slightly higher. American, Chinese, and British currencies also increased slightly by 0.5 yuan. British gold notes had balanced supply and demand, and the market price remained stable. American gold notes fluctuated within a narrow range, initially rising to 16.82 yuan, then retreating to 16.68 yuan, and finally settling at 16.74 yuan, an increase of 0.04 yuan compared to the previous day. Hong Kong Cai (currency) rose slightly by 0.03 yuan. The selling pressure on Japanese gold notes had subsided, and the market price rebounded, with the evening price at 1.365 yuan. Korean notes had strong demand, and the market price trended upwards, with the evening price rising to 1.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains Wuhu Kexian Rice Arrives in Port Exceeding 10,000 Packages, Foreign Rice Cannot Find Buyers</h3>
<p>With the continuous arrival of foreign rice, prices continued to decline. After the market opened in the morning, selling pressure intensified. Actual sales and speculator hoarding remained stagnant, and several new transactions were confirmed. The price of spot foreign rice immediately declined. Although the only source of local rice (transported by bicycle) was suddenly blocked, and water transport was tight, some major players insisted on not selling cheaply, but the prices gradually declined. The afternoon market was 70-80 fen to nearly one yuan lower than the previous afternoon, and 30-50 fen lower than the previous evening. The market fell another 30-50 fen as returned goods could not find buyers. New confirmed transactions included 1,000 tons of Saigon No. 2 from Jianyuan Company at a price of 75.75 yuan, and 500 tons from Shenji Foreign Firm at a price of 75.3 yuan. It was said that the amount was not yet fully met. Yesterday, it was reported that only 75 yuan was agreed for 1,000 tons from China Southern Enterprises Company, resulting in weak market sentiment. There is a high probability that the rice market will continue to decline in the near future.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 50-60 packages of Sutong glutinous rice were offered at 82 yuan. Early indica rice from Pukou was 81-82 yuan, and then 77-78 yuan, showing no significant change compared to the previous market.</p>
<p>Only 400-500 packages of new glutinous rice (Jian, Yaozhan, Baige, etc.) arrived from the lower reaches of the river. The selling prices were stable, with the usual destinations and no price changes. New glutinous rice from Minhang was offered at 78 yuan, Qingjiao Shenzhong at 80 yuan or 79 yuan, Baige from Xitang at 77 yuan, Qingjiao Dujian at 70.05 yuan, and then at 68 yuan. Taicang Yangjian was 67 yuan. Large quantities of Wuhu Kexian rice have been arriving daily, with large ships carrying no less than 10,000 packages. The price was 61-62 yuan. There were no significant changes in glutinous rice from both domestic and foreign sources.</p>
<h3>Foreign Flour Inventory Not High</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's supply from Chinese factories remained scarce. Actual sales on the street lacked goods to purchase, causing returned old brand prices to rise to 18.6-18.7 yuan. However, the amount of goods available was small, with only 200-300 packages traded. Speculative buying remained at 18.4-18.5 yuan, but there were no significant transactions due to the weekend. Although the inventory of foreign flour was thin, there were large transactions of foreign flour. There were concerns that the subsequent supply would not be sustained. The issue of the US government suspending export subsidies had a significant impact on the market, so market sentiment was cautious. It was heard that high-brand foreign flour was priced above 19 yuan, and Yangpaotai and Shuangying were priced at 18.8-18.85 yuan. More than 1,000 packages were purchased from the street, and the market prices were quite stable.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's market remained firm, as the current supply was scarce. Sellers insisted on holding, and factories showed little interest in purchasing. High-grade wheat sent to the concession area was offered at 27 yuan, but no further offers were made. Only 300-500 packages were sent to factories throughout the city, and the prices were still based on the original prices.</p>
<h3>Securities Domestic Prices Balanced, Market Prices Mixed</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for securities was stable yesterday. Market prices fluctuated within 0.1-0.2 yuan. Although there were many buyers, sellers were not weak. There were buyers for slightly lower prices, but Dingkang and No. 16 consistently bought in, seemingly brewing changes. Therefore, there was a state of indecision. Dingkang first bought in the morning, followed by No. 16. Then, Hongda and Lianyi sold out, causing the market to ease slightly, but the forces were evenly matched, and there were no significant changes in the morning. In the afternoon, Dingkang and No. 16 continued to absorb, and Lianhe and Lianyi also replenished. Yesterday's market price was high by 0.13 yuan, but it was suppressed by the continuous selling from Tongchang, Lemao, Hongsheng, and Yuanyuan. The results were mixed, with a difference of only 0.1-0.2 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.5 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 50 shares of Huashang Securities Exchange were traded at a price of 26.25 yuan.</p>
<p>London, 11th (Friday) Dispatch: Today's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt and Far East British companies' stocks remained sluggish. Only the stock of the Mercantile Bank of India rose by 2 shillings 6 pence to £7.00, while the rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Although Sales Season Passed, Cotton Yarn Speculation Still Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>The yarn market is still in a state of fluctuation, but most people are bullish. However, the current sales season has gradually passed. However, there is still plenty of speculative capital in Shanghai. Recently, speculation in foreign exchange and gold has been less appealing, and cotton yarn speculation is more interesting. Therefore, there are many people behind the scenes raising and suppressing prices. Market prices rise and fall suddenly, and future volatility is still latent. Today, 3,715 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The atmosphere in the spot yarn market was enthusiastic in the morning. The shouts were as chaotic as hemp, but new buyers were not active, and most adopted a wait-and-see attitude. 20-count Shuangma (Double Horse) yarn was initially priced at 1,175 yuan. Although many parties shouted high prices, acceptance was not enthusiastic. On the contrary, those who profited sold out, and the market slowly declined to 1,165 yuan. Middlemen and scalpers were more active, and the price rose again. The closing price was 1,173 yuan. According to the half-day transaction statistics, 3,465 bales were traded. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn rose by 5 yuan. The amount of cotton yarn purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Same Industry 2,720 Hong Kong 745</p>
<p>Total 3,465 Factories Not Interested Cotton Market Stagnant</p>
<p>The situation in the spot cotton market remains firm and quiet. Most people expect prices to rise, but factories are not interested in buying, so the market is increasingly stagnant. However, there are many transactions between colleagues, adding some activity.</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 191.50 Same industry bought 100 bales</p>
<p>WAD 261.00 Guang Sheng bought 400 pieces</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 280.00 Same industry bought 12 pieces</p>
<p>Sunderland Cotton 263.00 Chang Feng bought 100 pieces</p>
<p>Oil Market The Second Half of the Month's Oil Deliveries Have Begun</p>
<p>The spot oil market yesterday showed some changes based on the spot market situation. However, the futures crude oil market was estimated based on the spot market, and deliveries for the second half of October have also begun. Moreover, the original source was released, the amount of goods was sufficient, and the prices in the producing areas did not fluctuate significantly, so market sentiment was inevitably cautious. The market atmosphere was quite weak in the early morning, but in the afternoon, speculators took advantage of the situation to stir up the market, and the market rose gradually. As a result, the price turned to an increase of 0.2-0.3 yuan compared to the previous day. It was estimated that 50 pieces of Jiaozhou spot soybean oil were traded at a price of 79 yuan, 5,000 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil at a price of 81 yuan, 10 barrels of Dalian oil at a price of 111 yuan, and 100 loads of Dayou factory soybean oil at a price of 90 yuan. Spot Jiaozhou peanut oil was traded for 200 pieces at a price of 78.25-79 yuan, and 600 pieces for the lower half of October at the same price as spot oil. Also, 200 barrels of Qingdao spot oil were traded at a price of 106.2-109 yuan, 100 barrels for the lower half of October at a price of 108-108.25 yuan, and 150 barrels for the upper half of November at a price of 109.5-109.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Serge Drill Fine Cloth Increased with Yarn</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth: Yesterday's cloth market was initially stable and then rose. The reason was that actual sales still lacked progress, and market sentiment was that raw material prices were firm and cloth prices were suppressed. Holders of goods adopted a calm attitude, and hoarders still wanted to buy in when the opportunity arose. Yesterday, with the sharp rise in fine yarn, the prices of serge drill and poplin gray cloth all increased by 0.3-0.5 yuan per piece. Coarse cloth, twill, and colored cloth were stable. More than 600 pieces of gray cloth, colored cloth, and coarse cloth were traded on the street. More than 200 pieces of twill and colored cloth were traded by the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs. More than 10,000 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill were traded from various places in northern Jiangsu. More than 100 pieces of velvet, colored cloth, and coarse cloth were traded by the Yan-Jin gangs in the north.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The market was firm and rising, and the trend continued. The price of fine cloth increased by 0.3-0.4 yuan per piece. 12-pound Longtou closed at 36.4 yuan. Serge drill was firm. Buyers were eager for Sijunzi serge, and the price gradually rose to 1.09375 yuan.</p>
<p>Export: Today, 730 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong and 200 pieces were shipped to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market White Sugar Weak, Red Sugar Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar trend was flat, with mixed ups and downs. The current price of Grade 24 coarse white sugar was still 75 yuan at our warehouse for the public association's cut plate, and 74.4 yuan for goods arriving in July at other warehouses, up 0.2 yuan. The current price of transshipment goods remained unchanged at 59 yuan. The ticket number for the 20th of this month was 58.3 yuan, up 0.3 yuan. The price of Dutch red sugar was up 0.4-0.5 yuan, with the current price at 56.3-56.5 yuan, and the ticket number at 56 yuan. The price of Taikoo's Che R Yue B was 73.3 yuan, unchanged. The price of Dongzhan was 72.5 yuan, down 0.2 yuan. The price of DY mark was 70.2 yuan, down 0.2 yuan. The price of HX mark was 70.8 yuan, down 0.2 yuan. The price of HM mark was 66.1 yuan, down 0.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coal White Coal Transactions Active</h3>
<p>The white coal business has been extremely active in recent days. There is demand from all sides, and purchasing interest has remained strong. Transactions between colleagues have reached 300-500 tons per day. The explicit and implicit prices have both trended tighter. Yesterday, a certain firm traded Hai Yue coal at 216 yuan per ton. Old tickets in the market also required around 205-206 yuan. The price from the warehouse to the cart, plus handling fees.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials Armor Scales Rising Sharply</h3>
<p>A few boxes of armor scales arrived a few days ago. Since the market inventory was not large, the asking price increased by 5 yuan. However, there was no armor skin arriving, and there was a shortage, so the market was very tight, with prices rising by 20-30 yuan.</p>
<p>Distinguishing the Authenticity of Banknotes (10) Shen Yun</p>
<p>Addendum: Inquiries have been made regarding the 10-yuan and 1-yuan banknotes printed by the Huade Road Company in the 13th year of the Republic of China, which were not previously listed. The responses are as follows:</p>
<p>The design of the 10-yuan note is green on both sides. The central image on the front is the same as the 10-yuan note from the 3rd year of the Republic of China. There are 10-yuan numerals on both sides. The central image on the reverse is a view of the bank's building, with Arabic numerals on both sides. This note has been completely withdrawn and is no longer issued.</p>
<p>The design of the 1-yuan note is light yellow on both sides. The central image on the front is the same as the 1-yuan note from the 3rd year of the Republic of China. There are 1-yuan numerals on both sides. The central image on the reverse is a view of the bank's building, with Arabic numerals on both sides. Due to poor printing quality, there were concerns that it would be easy to forge, so only a small number of notes were issued and then immediately withdrawn and not issued.</p>
<p>Therefore, among the banknotes issued by the bank in the 13th year of the Republic of China, only the 5-yuan note is still found in the market. The other 10-yuan and 1-yuan notes have long since disappeared, so they were not listed.</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>In "Miscellaneous Banknotes," "Siming" was mistakenly written as "Six Banks," and "Zhejiang Xingye" was mistakenly written as "China Xingye." We hereby issue a correction.</p>
<h3>(6) Foreign Currency and Suspended Currency</h3>
<p>The Central Bank notes printed in 1926 included those with the Hankou place name and the large silver dollar notes for the three provinces of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. In April 1927, the Wuhan government ordered the concentration of cash in the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications, and the redemption of notes was suspended. In the winter of 1928, the National Government's Ministry of Finance reorganized this by using the long-term financial public bonds of 1928 to exchange Central Bank notes at full face value. The exchange period ended at the end of July 1929, and any remaining notes became invalid. Those found in the market now are these invalid notes. There are also place names of Guangdong and Fujian provinces, which are also invalid notes of the same kind.</p>
<p>China's Hankou-named notes can still be exchanged for gold-backed long-term bonds, but only in units of ten yuan or more.</p>
<p>The bank also has the 1912 version of the Yellow Emperor image exchange notes, which are only valid for Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang place names. The Beijing place name can be remitted to the mainland, and the place names of other provinces have been invalidated and redemption suspended. As a result, many place name notes have been changed, and the reprinted ones are very good, making them difficult to distinguish. Only the bank can identify which numbers are for notes from guaranteed areas by checking the numbers.</p>
<p>In addition, notes with place names of the three northeastern provinces and notes with place names of Chahar and Harbin have also expired and redemption has been suspended.</p>
<p>The bank's Hankou notes have old and new versions. Initially, the old Hankou notes were the same as the Chinese Hankou notes, and redemption was suspended. They could only be exchanged for gold-backed long-term bonds. Later, most of these notes were exchanged back, and the remaining amount was small, so they could be used in the same way as Shanghai notes. It was not until July 1939 that the new version of notes could only be remitted to the mainland according to the North China notes method.</p>
<p>In addition, notes with place names of the three northeastern provinces have also been suspended and invalidated.</p>
<p>The bank's Northern Small place name notes and the bank's old notes before the reorganization have all been suspended and invalidated.</p>
<p>Foreign currency can be remitted to the mainland to the following six provinces: Sichuan, Yunnan, Guangxi, Guizhou, Tianjin, and Shandong.</p>
<p>Foreign currency from the eight banks must be transferred through the receiving bank separately.</p>
<p>The 1912 edition of the Yellow Emperor image exchange notes is of great historical significance and created a new era of credit for our country's banknotes. In the early years of the Republic of China, most of the banknotes circulating in Shanghai were issued by foreign merchant banks. Later, the credit of our country's banknotes gradually increased, and the amount issued also gradually increased. In 1916, when Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor, he ordered the suspension of redemption, and other banks followed suit. Some branches of the Bank of China in various places suspended redemption, while others took a wait-and-see attitude, which caused a great panic in the financial world. However, the Shanghai branch of the Bank of China deeply understood the importance of Shanghai's financial relations and made every effort to maintain credit, redeeming all deposits and banknotes, and the great turmoil was quelled invisibly. The credit of banknotes in Shanghai was thus firmly established.</p>
<p>The bank also has a 20-yuan note, which has been completely withdrawn due to inconvenience of use, but it is not a suspended note. If found, it can still be used.</p>

<h3>US Navy in China Not Yet Preparing to Withdraw. External Rumors Proved Entirely Unfounded. US Bridge Evacuation Entirely Preventative.</h3>
<p>Rumors that the US Marine Corps would withdraw from China, leading to the Marine Corps' various agencies preparing to close down and withdrawing deposits from American banks in Shanghai, are said to be completely inaccurate according to reliable sources. The US Marine Corps here has not received any instructions to prepare for withdrawal, so there will be no action for the time being. According to the above rumors, which arose a few days ago, even claiming that American banks in Shanghai refused to open new accounts for customers and limited withdrawals to no more than 100 yuan each time, an investigation by reporters proved that these claims were entirely unfounded. At the same time, regarding the proposal to evacuate the families of Americans in Shanghai, the US consular authorities here have not yet issued any further instructions. Since news from Washington clarified that the proposal to evacuate civilians was entirely a precautionary measure, the mood of Americans here is not as tense as before, and the atmosphere has greatly eased.</p>
<p>Shanghai Reservists Undergo Physical Examinations</p>
<p>Also, rumors that 60 American naval reservists residing in Shanghai were ordered to report to the Marine Corps headquarters and receive instructions regarding their inaction were, according to reporter investigations, greatly exaggerated. These reservists were only reporting to headquarters for physical examinations. These physical examinations are held annually. During yesterday's examination, two people were found to be unqualified and will not participate in training. Yesterday, it was widely rumored among Americans in Shanghai that American naval reservists would join the naval mobilization order issued by Washington on October 6.</p>
<p>Consulate Notice Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>The English-language "Great America" newspaper reported that Mr. Buick, the acting US Consul General in Shanghai, told reporters that the US Consulate would issue a notice today (the 12th) advising American residents in the city who do not need to remain in Shanghai to leave Shanghai as soon as possible. Mr. Buick declined to disclose the contents of the notice, but said that the notice was largely the same as the Washington telegram reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Major Commercial Firms Independently Sending Employees Home</p>
<p>American commercial firms in the city, such as the Shanghai Telephone Company and Mobil Oil Company, have obtained approval from their American headquarters to use company funds to send employees and their families back to the United States. A major American merchant recently told reporters that he believed that the proposed withdrawal of Americans from the city would be fully implemented. It is also heard that several members of the US Embassy staff in Beijing have withdrawn their registrations in Beijing and returned to the United States.</p>
<p>Reserved Ship Berths Only Registrations</p>
<p>Yesterday, the passenger ticket department of the President Lines stated that recent reports that American return trip passenger tickets have all been sold out are actually unrelated to the recent international situation. Since the Sino-US Pacific route, the shipping agency for American merchants in the city, only has the President Lines, although there are other British China Shipping Company and Japanese Nippon Yusen Kaisha several families, but Americans would never take other countries' ships, so the company's passenger tickets had been booked in advance for all ships going to the United States this year before Germany, Italy, and Japan announced their alliance, but most of them are only registrations, and whether to purchase tickets at that time is another question.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships at Zhenhai Port Bombard Zhenhai, 21 Shells Land in the Urban Area, Destroying More Than 20 Houses, No Casualties</h3>
<p>Zhejiang groups in Shanghai received the following telegram from eastern Zhejiang yesterday: (1) Eight Japanese warships anchored outside Zhenhai port. At 5:00 AM on the 11th, one ship departed eastward. At 7:18 AM, three more ships departed eastward. At 8:05 AM, one Japanese warship sailed from the north. At 8:34 AM, two more ships departed eastward and one departed northward. At 10:20 AM, one Japanese warship at Zhenhai port suddenly</p>
<p>Opened Fire on the Suburbs</p>
<p>Thirty-six shells. Two shells landed at No. 35 Xuejia Lane, destroying two houses. One shell landed in the open space near Xuejia Lane. One shell landed at Dajiaochang, destroying one house. Two shells landed at the Chen residence in Tianjiabudu, destroying two houses. Two shells landed at No. 15, destroying three houses. Two shells landed at No. 15 Muxing Lane, destroying one house. One shell landed at No. 24, destroying one house. One shell landed in Dongyi Lane, destroying one house. One shell landed in the open space in front and one shell landed in the open space behind.</p>
<p>Wangjiabudu</p>
<p>Two shells landed, destroying two houses. Three shells landed at No. 14, destroying five houses. One shell landed at No. 13, destroying one house. One shell landed at No. 21, destroying one house. At 11:15 AM, one Japanese warship at Zhenhai departed eastward. There is still one ship anchored. At 1:48 PM, the Japanese warship anchored outside Zhenhai port fired another 38 shells to the north. At 2:35 PM, it fiercely fired 15 shells at Jiangnan, all landing in the sand, causing no damage. (2) Yesterday at 8:15 AM,</p>
<p>Chuanshan Waters</p>
<p>One Japanese warship sailed from the north and blindly fired 14 shells at Chuanshan. At 8:35 AM, the ship sailed east. At 11:50 AM, four Japanese warships sailed from Tingshuimen in the direction of Hengshan and anchored off the coast of Meishan. There was no change. At 2:35 PM, another ship sailed over. There are now a total of five Japanese warships anchored off Hengshan. (3) Three Japanese warships anchored outside Zhenhai port. At 7:45 AM yesterday morning, they fired another 87 shells at Jiangnan without aiming, but all the shells landed in barren land and sand, causing no damage.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador Count de Kerchove de Denterghem Returns to Shanghai from Beijing, Arriving by Ship on the 10th</h3>
<p>Belgian Ambassador to China, Count de Kerchove de Denterghem, took his family north to Beijing in early June for a summer retreat, staying for three months. Now that autumn has arrived and embassy affairs urgently need to be handled, he took the Kailuan Company passenger ship south and arrived in Shanghai on the 10th to resume his duties.</p>
<p>Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires Leaves Shanghai for Chongqing</p>
<p>Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires, Mr. Katz-Zeuthen, recently left Shanghai for Hong Kong to visit the central authorities and maintain close contact with the Chinese government. According to his planned itinerary, he will stay in Chengdu for several weeks before taking a plane from Hong Kong back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Huang Xuanping Abducted Yesterday</h3>
<p>Huang Xuanping, a local, 34 years old, resides at No. 669 Hart Road, Shanghai. Huang usually uses his own car, No. 5469, for transportation. Yesterday around 12:45 PM, Huang, wearing a Western suit, walked out of the company and got into his car at the intersection of Muirhead Road, driving himself home for lunch. At the time, the car was heading west. When he reached the door of his house at the intersection of Bubbling Well Road and Hart Road, three ambushers suddenly jumped out from the side of the road, each holding a handgun, stopping him from making noise and jumping into the car, forcing Huang to drive away. The car and the person were abducted without a trace. Soon, Huang's family learned of the situation and went to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to report and request an investigation. The police station, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to rush to pursue and investigate, but he had disappeared. They notified police stations in various districts and the French Concession to pay attention to the whereabouts of the car. More than an hour later, the car was found on a road in western Shanghai.</p>
<h3>National Day Thrift Savings Achieve Excellent Results, Subscriptions Exceed Projected Amounts, All Sectors Vigorously Practice Thrift and Continue Efforts</h3>
<p>In Shanghai, in order to commemorate the Double Tenth National Day, a vigorous thrift and national construction savings movement was launched on that day. In order to express patriotic enthusiasm, develop economic construction, and implement a solid foundation of prosperity, all sectors enthusiastically subscribed to savings amounts, like a rising tide, which was extremely enthusiastic. They have already exceeded the projected target, and the results are extremely satisfactory. All sectors also recognize the great significance of thrift in national construction, so they have abandoned extravagant and indulgent habits and practiced the spirit of enduring hardship to vigorously promote the thrift and savings movement that benefits both individuals and others. Therefore, the amount of subscriptions will increase sharply in the future.</p>
<h3>French Concession Water and Electricity Workers' Strike, Labor and Management Still Not Close, French Concession Authorities Are Working Hard to Mediate, Workers Add Conditions Yesterday</h3>
<p>The French Concession Water and Electricity Company's labor strike, which suddenly expanded the day before yesterday, still showed no sign of resolution yesterday. The total number of striking workers is more than 1,200. It is reported that they held a meeting again yesterday and decided to (1) add a request for the issuance of uniforms and annual bonus subsidies to field workers, in addition to the 16 demands; (2) insist that the management must recognize the six preconditions before agreeing to resume work as a whole. However, according to reporters, the management has stated that it cannot accept the preconditions and that the company cannot recognize the representatives elected by the "New Trade Union" and hold negotiations with them, which has led to both sides moving to extremes and unable to get close. Traffic is completely disrupted. Some of the arrested workers were released yesterday, including drivers Han Fanggui and seven others, and ticket sellers Gu Dahai and five others.</p>
<p>Police Authorities Engage in Mediation</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, four labor representatives went to the political department of the French Police Station to request mediation. The department accepted the request, and the two sides talked for a long time before the labor representatives left. Afterwards, the political department also consulted with the company, and the results of the negotiations were more advanced than in previous days, and it seems that a resolution can be expected soon.</p>
<p>Strict Protection in Front of the Power Plant</p>
<p>The situation in the French Concession was very tense yesterday. Many French Police Station police officers were stationed outside the power plant gate for strict protection. At the same time, most of the White Russian workers stayed in the factory day and night to prevent attacks or abductions by striking workers. The electricity supply in the French Concession is not expected to be interrupted for the time being. Since all the Chinese employees went on strike on Friday morning, 60 temporary White Russian workers have been hired to assist European staff in maintaining operations.</p>
<h3>Hope of Establishing a Special Police Force in Western Shanghai Fades, Municipal Council Detectives Maintain Order</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of the "Special Police" for road construction in the Shanghai West Extra-Settlement Roads Area, Major Bowen, Director of the Municipal Council Police, submitted a proposal and opinion letter to President and General Manager Fei Lida (Fu Xiao'an) and has been waiting for a reply. Because the official document was translated into Chinese, English, and Japanese, the process was slow and has not yet been received. Since Fu was assassinated and died, the negotiations have fallen into a standstill again. Recently, Major Bowen has not held private talks with the other party, so there is no hope of establishing a "special police force" for the time being. At present, the Municipal Council Police Department is still sending detectives to maintain order in the Extra-Settlement Roads Area, and the White Russian team of the Foreign Merchant Corps and the Italian Army's San Marco Battalion stationed in Shanghai are jointly assisting.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Frequently Patrol Western Shanghai</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese troops have been traveling frequently in western Shanghai and parading in formation. Armed Japanese military police on bicycles are constantly patrolling on Avenue Haig, Avenue du Colonel Henri, and Rue Lokawei all day long. Since the shooting of a Japanese soldier in the Xujiahui area, the Japanese Miura Military Police Department at the Observatory and the Catholic Church has tightened security, and soldiers are also traveling in groups to prevent accidents.</p>
<h3>Standard Time Resumes Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai daylight saving time, after authorities announced it would end, ceased at midnight yesterday. Starting at zero hour this morning, all sectors followed the authorities' regulations and uniformly set their clocks back one hour. All agencies, public organizations, schools, and industrial and commercial sectors have resumed office hours or business hours on standard time from today. For all vehicles entering and leaving the factories and the shift changes of workers, the tramcars of both Concessions' public automobile and trolleybus service also resumed their old schedule. Shanghai's banking industry, money changers, and the two associations issued a public announcement yesterday in order to resume business at the original time, saying, "The authorities of the two concessions in Shanghai have determined that daylight saving time will end at midnight on October 12 (Saturday). The member banks and firms of the two associations will also set their clocks back one hour at the same time, and will return to business hours as they were before June 1. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>After the Death of Fu Xiao'an, the Japanese Side Intensifies Security, Military and Police Are Fully Deployed for House-to-House Searches, Ships Along Yangshupu Are Not Allowed to Leave Shore</h3>
<p>The case of Chuan Xiao'an being killed in his residence on Shih Kao Ta Road by a male servant at around 4:30 AM the day before yesterday, the murderer being at large, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. According to sources, after the discovery of Chuan's murder, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces Command, being in close proximity, immediately dispatched a large number of marines and over ten military vehicles after receiving the news, conducting extensive searches and implementing emergency security measures. They also notified the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railway lines to suspend operations, and ships along the Yangshupu riverside were also prohibited from leaving port. House-to-house searches were conducted, and even passing cars and pedestrians were not spared. These measures continued until yesterday without any relaxation. Detectives from both concessions have been issued photos of the male servant Zhu Sheng Yuan, suspected of stabbing Chuan, since yesterday morning, hoping for his capture. However, both railway lines have resumed operations since yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Today Encoffining, Burial Next to City Hall</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that detectives from the Public Concession, the French Concession, and the "Municipal Police Bureau" all received photos of Zhu Sheng Yuan, the assassin of Fu Xiao'an, this morning (the 12th) in order to be vigilant for his capture at any time. This morning, the Japanese search teams were also active in the western district, stopping vehicles and pedestrians for detailed inspection. Chuan's body will be placed in a coffin at Chuan's residence on Shih Kao Ta Road at 2 PM on the 13th. The coffin will be moved to the city center for mourning. It is rumored that Fu's coffin will be buried near the City Hall building.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Yu Kui Denies Marriage Alliance</p>
<p>Lawyer Guo Zuo Tang wrote to this newspaper yesterday, "To the Editor, I am instructed by my client, Mr. Zhu Zi Kui, to state that upon reading the local news section of today's Shen Bao, he was extremely surprised to find a news item stating that Chuan Xiao'an's daughter had married Zhu Zi Kui. Upon investigation, my client's wife is originally from the Pang family and has no marriage relationship with the Chuan family. This kind of reporting is deeply feared to confuse the listeners. Therefore, I respectfully request that you send a letter to the newspaper for correction." Accordingly, I am forwarding this request, hoping that your newspaper will make the correction. Sincerely, Shen Bao Editorial Department, Lawyer Guo Zuo Tang, October 12, Year 29." However, this newspaper yesterday printed the three characters "Zhu Zi Gui."</p>
<p>Another Account of the Assassination</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry yesterday with relatives and friends close to Fu, Fu was wounded by a knife in a total of six places. It is said that there was one cut each above and below the mouth, one cut on the eye, two cuts on the left and right sides of the neck, and one cut on the top of the head. The wounds on the top of the head and neck were the most serious, i.e., the fatal areas. When Fu was stabbed, Fu's family members heard Fu moaning, but because Fu often talked in his sleep, they did not pay attention. Zhu Sheng, the servant who stabbed Fu, had previously worked at the old house in the French Concession, weeding, planting flowers, sweeping the courtyard, and doing odd jobs. Later, the new house on Shih Kao Ta Road needed an employee to manage the stove and mop the floors, so he was transferred there, for only three months. After he committed the assassination, he took a bicycle and left the house. It was not yet dawn, and the guards, accustomed to him getting up at 2 AM every night to tend to the stove, allowed him to enter and exit the house, so he was able to leave at his leisure.</p>
<h3>Nanchiao Children's Home Chrysanthemum Show Scheduled for Broadcast Promotion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Children's Home, located at No. 99, Lane 258, Wuding Road, No. 99, held its second executive meeting yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM for the painting and chrysanthemum exhibition organized to raise funds for the construction of a workshop and expand the education and care funds. It was decided that fundraising broadcasts will be held for three days from October 21st to 23rd. It was also decided that the conference time would be from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Personnel Investigating Fenghua Disaster Conditions Departed for Ningbo Today</h3>
<p>The drought in Fenghua has recently become increasingly serious, especially in Zhongyi Township. The Fenghua Compatriot Association held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors on the 5th of this month, unanimously deciding to first send personnel to Fenghua to investigate the actual conditions in the disaster area, and then determine a relief plan. The personnel dispatched were originally scheduled to depart on the 7th, but due to various reasons, they departed yesterday. According to a gentleman participating in the investigation in Fenghua, the trip will take half a month to return to Shanghai. After the investigation, they will return to Shanghai to report and discuss comprehensive relief measures.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Compatriot Association Relief for Hometown Rice Shortage</h3>
<p>The Dinghai Shanghai Compatriot Association has previously raised 10,000 yuan, remitted to County Magistrate Su in a certain place in Dinghai, and ordered rice for relief. Now, through overall planning and distribution, all villages and towns have benefited. Currently, the rice prices on various islands such as Zhoushan, Xiushan, Qushan, Liuheng, Xiazhizi, and Jintang average only about 25 or 26 yuan, and with the autumn harvest approaching, it is hoped that prices will gradually fall. However, this year, due to the severe drought and scarce rainfall, the autumn harvest is less than ideal, reaching only 60%, which is truly a drawback.</p>

<h3>Strong Desire for Food Regulation, All Sectors Participate in Rice Purchase, Ningbo Compatriot Association Organizes Collective Rice Purchase, Price Stabilization Committee to Meet Next Monday</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association has been repeatedly commissioned to handle group orders of foreign rice, totaling more than 60,000 bags, greatly benefiting the citizens. Yesterday, a gentleman from the association told a reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency that the association's 23rd batch of orders has already been completed and will arrive in Shanghai in mid-November, at which time it can be distributed to the respective purchasers. As for the 24th batch, registration is still in progress, and once a sufficient number is collected, orders will be placed with foreign countries in due course. The gentleman continued, "Group ordering of foreign rice not only obtains cheaper grain, but also increases the reserves of rice warehouses, achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop. This is truly an urgent matter. All major factories, companies, businesses, and all agencies and organizations are urged to participate enthusiastically in order to order and transport supplies to Shanghai for regulation in batches." (The association's hope that all sectors will participate in collective rice purchase is quite profound. When the reporter first entered the association's office, the gentleman immediately handed over a rice purchase registration form, urging him to fill it out immediately. Only after the reporter explained his intention did the gentleman suddenly realize.)</p>
<p>Ningbo People Purchase Rice</p>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association held its 15th joint meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday afternoon. After discussion, it was unanimously agreed that the current rice prices in the city are rising daily, making it difficult for ordinary people to make a living. The Compatriot Association should organize a group rice purchase committee to organize group rice purchases for compatriots. It was resolved that Yan Boying, Zhang Lianfang, Gui Yanfang, Chen Qingzhao, Qin Runqing, Chen Yiting, and Ge Weian should be appointed as members, and Gui Yanfang was appointed as chairman. It was also resolved on the spot: (1) The full price of the rice will be collected as a deposit; (2) Each household's group rice purchase will be in units of five bags; (3) Fuyuan Qianzhuang is designated as the collection agency; (4) This committee will hold a meeting next week; (5) Yan Boying is responsible for drafting the rules and regulations. Zhang Delong, chairman of the Shanghai Cooked Water Industry Association, is also encouraging colleagues to participate in group rice purchases.</p>
<p>Proceeding with Price Stabilization</p>
<p>The Shanghai Price Stabilization Committee has been established since January 5 of this year, and it has been seven months. It has held three rounds of broken rice price stabilization, selling a total of 102,296 bags of rice, with a loss of more than 718,400 yuan. The second round also held three rounds, in addition to the 10,000 bags or so of tribute rice sold in the first two rounds of this session, and the loss reached more than 157,000 yuan. As for the amount of tribute rice sold and the amount of loss in the third round of this session, the statistics have not yet been completed. Now, in order to discuss the procedures for continuing the price stabilization in the next session, the committee has scheduled a standing committee meeting to be held on the 14th of this month (Monday) at the Guangdong Road Shipping Club to discuss specific measures for price stabilization. However, the committee, due to financial constraints, hopes that all sectors will contribute generously.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Arriving in Large Quantities</p>
<p>Regarding the sources of domestic and foreign rice, they have been continuously arriving in recent days and are being transported to warehouses for assessment. Therefore, warehouse reserves are increasing day by day. According to an estimate by a rice industry committee member, the city's existing rice reserves are sufficient for four and a half months of consumption for both Chinese and foreign residents, and the source of supply is not expected to be interrupted. According to news from the rice industry yesterday, a large batch of foreign rice loaded on a French postal ship is expected to arrive in port on the 10th of this month. Once the foreign rice arrives, the prices of rice in various stores will continue to fall. As for the source of domestic rice, it has also been increasing recently, with the quantity arriving daily from the production areas by land and water routes ultimately being more than 1,000 bags or 2,000 bags. The purchase price of this rice is quite low, and once it arrives in Shanghai, it can generate substantial additional profits, so various merchants are actively purchasing and waiting for the opportunity to transport it to Shanghai for the market.</p>
<h3>American President's Ship "Caffier" Arrives in Shanghai</h3>

Passengers will transfer to small boats and land at the New Customs Wharf at 12:30 PM. The mail ship will stay in Shanghai for one night and leave tomorrow (the 14th) at 10:00 AM for Hong Kong, Luzon, and various ports in Southeast Asia, returning to the United States via the Cape of Good Hope. Of the passengers on this trip, 29 will disembark in Shanghai, and 85 will take the original ship to Southeast Asia or around the world.</p>
<h3>Statistics on the Number of Refugees in Both Concessions</h3>
<p>Due to the impact of the war, refugees who fled to and were stranded in this city have been returning one after another. According to statistics released by relief organizations, as of the end of last month, less than 30,000 refugees remained in the Public Concession and the French Concession. According to a report released by the Municipal Council's Health Department the day before yesterday (the 11th), after the department's investigation, there are currently only 15,625 refugees in the Public Concession, and there are only 13 reception centers remaining.</p>
<h3>Goods and Passengers Stranded in Vietnam Approved for Return to Hong Kong, Shanghai Representative Has Returned from Vietnam to Hong Kong, First Prepare a List and Then Notify the Vietnamese Governor</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army landed in Vietnam, transportation between Vietnam and Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou has been completely suspended. Shanghai businesses previously transported passengers and goods to Southwest China through Vietnam, which were stranded in Saigon, Tourane, and Haiphong. Businessmen from various industries, seeing the situation in Vietnam becoming increasingly tense, decided through joint meetings to return all passengers and goods stranded in Saigon, etc., to Shanghai via Hong Kong, and Cao Anxuan was dispatched to Vietnam. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce also prepared letters to the Saigon Chinese Chamber of Commerce and the Consulate General in Saigon to provide assistance and care. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the transportation industry yesterday that the issue of returning passengers and goods stranded in Saigon, etc., has been approved by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and submitted to the Vietnamese Governor, who specially approved the return to Hong Kong. The owners of the goods prepared a list and notified the Vietnamese Governor. Now, Cao Anxuan, dispatched by Shanghai, has returned from Vietnam to Hong Kong to contact ships to handle the return of passengers and goods stranded in Vietnam. Regarding passengers and goods to be returned to Shanghai, they must wait until they have returned to Hong Kong before being loaded onto ships for return to Shanghai. All return shipping costs must be borne by the owners of the goods.</p>
<h3>Huge Value Copper Ingot Theft Case, Thieves Are Shameless, Originally Involved in Private Arms Sales and Kidnapping, Relying on Japanese Military Talismans, They Made Wild Remarks, Swiss Consul Protests to Japanese Authorities</h3>
<p>The "China Press" reported that copper ingots and copper coins worth US$100,000 belonging to the American-owned Mao Sheng Foreign Firm, stored in the warehouse of the American-owned Ruifeng Transfer Company in the Public Concession, were recently stolen by a crowd led by Swiss national White Le. The Swiss Consulate issued an arrest warrant, and police officers from the Municipal Council's Police Department, together with police officers from the Japanese Consulate, went to the Broadway Building with the warrant some days ago to arrest White. However, they were obstructed by Japanese military police. The lawyer for Mao Sheng Foreign Firm will lodge a protest with the American Consulate in this city regarding the actions of the Japanese military police. It is said that White did not openly resist the arrest warrant from the Swiss Consulate, but asked his lawyer to summon armed Japanese military police to the scene to obstruct the arrest. White also telephoned the manager of Mao Sheng Foreign Firm, threatening that if the matter was pursued further, there would be dire consequences. According to reports, White has been in China for a long time. Many years ago, he was involved in privately transporting weapons and ammunition in Sichuan, which resulted in his imprisonment for six months, narrowly escaping execution by shooting. Later, he came to Shanghai and partnered with others to fraudulently sell insurance vests under false pretenses, defrauding funds, and was sued by the authorities. After that, White and a Greek national in Shanghai kidnapped a Chinese general and extorted a large ransom, and were arrested. The Greek national was sentenced to a long prison term by the Special District Court. A reporter from the "Continental Daily News" met White in the Broadway Building yesterday (the 11th). White, relying on the Japanese military as a talisman, made wild remarks, even speaking disrespectfully of the Chinese government, ridiculing the American authorities, and criticizing the actions of the police officers of the Municipal Council's Police Department. He even forgot that he was a Swiss national and declared himself one of the "victors" here, truly a shameless scoundrel among Swiss nationals. White's words were roughly as follows: The copper he stole was "enemy property" and "contraband" confiscated by the Japanese army, not belonging to Mao Sheng Foreign Firm, but belonging to the Chinese government, which entrusted Mao Sheng Foreign Firm to manage it only with a contract to deceive others. Although some of these copper ingots have been shipped out, they have not all been shipped out. The remaining ones will soon be seized by the Japanese army or handed over to the Japanese side by the American authorities. He has documents issued by the Japanese army, specializing in investigating "enemy" property in the Public Concession and can request assistance when necessary to carry out his "task of confiscating enemy property." He also has a document issued by the Japanese military police, allowing him to be exempt from arrest or detention while performing his "task." The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that according to sources close to Mao Sheng Foreign Firm, White's words about the owner of the stolen copper were completely fabricated and ridiculous, not worth commenting on. According to sources in charge, there is no doubt about the ownership of the copper stored in the Ruifeng Transfer Company warehouse. The copper was legally transferred to Mao Sheng Foreign Firm by the Chinese Mint in 1937 to pay for the price of the minting machines, and has since been stored in the warehouse. It is said that when the theft was discovered, the copper had not been completely stolen. It is estimated that the stolen copper was worth about US$100,000. The Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, Fang Danier, protested to the Japanese Consul General today, objecting to the Japanese military police preventing the police officers of the Municipal Council's Police Department from arresting White, and requested the cooperation of the Japanese authorities to arrest White.</p>
<h3>Conspiring to Embezzle Huge Sums of French Currency, Falsely Reporting Robbery, Three Offenders Sentenced to One Year Each</h3>
<p>Chen Zemin, a native of Zhenjiang, was a partner in the Capital Tongcheng Qianzhuang and was trusted by the manager of the qianzhuang, Jin Zhongheng. For more than a year, he had been responsible for transferring funds between Nanjing and Shanghai without any errors. On September 29, he brought a large sum of 45,000 yuan in French currency to Shanghai and deposited it in the Longchang Qianzhuang on Sichuan Road. His relative and fellow townsman, Lu Zhenquan, learned of this and instigated Chen Zemin to seize the opportunity to embezzle the funds and falsely report a robbery, so that he could live a carefree life overseas. Chen was seduced by him, and after discussing the plan, he bought a pair of glasses in Nanjing and covered the lower end with plaster, revealing only a line of faint light. Then he and Lu went to Shanghai together. First, they took a rickshaw with a black rattan suitcase containing the French currency to the Zhaoshang Hotel at No. 13, Lane 566, Zhejiang Road. Lu handed the suitcase to his fellow townsman, Gao Yuren (Lu's brother-in-law), who worked as a tea boy, explaining the plan. Gao took another yellow leather suitcase and had Chen Zemin open the black rattan suitcase, take out 100 yuan of French currency for miscellaneous expenses, and transfer the rest to the yellow leather suitcase, which was handed over to the hotel accountant, Cheng Yunpeng, for safekeeping. After a while, Chen reported the case to the Sihu Division Police Station, falsely claiming that the large sum of French currency had been surrounded by six robbers armed with pistols near the intersection of North Henan Road and Lao Baizi Road, who silenced him and used a pair of dark glasses to blind him, and that the rattan suitcase had been robbed at that time. The false report was discovered by Chinese Detective Shang Wu and Detective Guo Xiangyao, who arrested the three offenders, Chen, Lu, and Gao, and sent them to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, filed a lawsuit against them for embezzlement and false reporting of robbery, requesting severe punishment. After being instructed to await sentencing, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial yesterday morning and sentenced the three defendants, Chen, Lu, and Gao, to one year of imprisonment each as a warning.</p>
<h3>Romantic Girl Yang Jinfeng Disappeared with Her Mother, The Girl Was Passionate About Movies and Actors, Her Mother Protected Her and They Escaped Together, The Elderly Father Was Left Alone and Utterly Miserable</h3>
<p>Yang Haifeng, 46 years old, from Shandong, is a physician specializing in trauma and mental illness. He has been practicing at No. Bei'anli on Dama Road, Xiaguan, Nanjing, for more than 20 years. After the war, he moved to Shanghai and rented a residence at No. 434 Jiujiang Road, across from the Securities Building. He opened the Yang Haifeng Plaster Shop, specializing in the sale of various plasters for bruises and sprains, and all kinds of rheumatic medicinal wines. The business was good, and he had a small amount of savings. His wife, Zang, is from Xuzhou Prefecture, Jiangsu Province, and is 46 years old. She has only one daughter, named Jinfeng, with the nickname Lingdi, also known as Liqiu, who is 18 years old and has some beauty. She speaks both northern and southern dialects. The little girl loves beauty, and after coming to Shanghai, she has been influenced by what she has seen and heard, perming her hair and tattooing her body, resembling a modern woman.</p>
<p>Seeking Advice from Neighbors, Gradually Planting Seeds of Love</p>
<p>Jinfeng once studied in the sixth grade of the Shanghai East Elementary School in the Silk Industry Building on Hankou Road. Her parents only had this one daughter and loved her deeply. A neighbor, Fang, who is in his thirties and from Yangzhou, initially worked as an accountant in a transportation company, earning 20 yuan a month. His wife used to work in a cotton mill in western Shanghai. Fang is a suave and frivolous young man. Due to their neighborly relationship, they were all familiar with each other. Sometimes, when Jinfeng had difficulties in her studies, she would ask Fang for advice. Over time, the seeds of love were gradually planted, and their affection grew. Sometimes they went to the movies together or accompanied each other to amusement parks, walking arm in arm, like lovebirds. However, although people outside had criticized this situation, Haifeng was completely unaware.</p>
<p>Obsessed with Movies, Not Returning Home All Night</p>
<p>Jinfeng is usually obsessed with movies, wanting to find a star title in the industry to show off. She asked someone to introduce her, and last winter she joined the Jin Xing and Yi Hua film companies as an actress. She has been on camera, playing supporting roles as maids in "Three Smiles" films, and her figure can also be seen in "Du Shiniang," which is currently showing at the Shanghai Guang Theater. As a result, she became even more romantic and sometimes did not return home all night. Although Haifeng deeply loved his daughter, he saw this licentious behavior as damaging to the family reputation. He often advised her in gentle words, hoping that she could restrain herself a little. However, his wife, Zang, protected Jinfeng. The elderly couple had conflicting opinions, so there were often quarrels in the family.</p>
<p>Taking All Possessions and Escaping Secretly with Her Mother</p>
<p>On the morning of the 9th of last month, while Yang was ill in bed, the mother and daughter took a suitcase, storing hundreds of yuan of French currency, a current savings book from the Bank of Communications with account number 25318, totaling 350 yuan, and a Shanghai Bank positive deposit book with 300 yuan, as well as Yang Haifeng's personal seal, and many pieces of clothing, fur coats, and silk shirts, and secretly left through the back door, disappearing without a trace. There has been no news of them to date. Yesterday, Yang told a reporter that he had already started investigating the matter and that the truth would soon come to light. He also said that he had intended to find a good son-in-law for Jinfeng, hoping to have someone to rely on in his old age, but who knew that his wishes would not be fulfilled and that he would end up with this licentious and immoral wretch. While speaking, he shed tears and was utterly miserable.</p>
<h3>Landlord of Chengyu Lane on Lafayette Road Cuts Off Water</h3>
<p>All the houses in Chengyu Lane on Lafayette Road in the French Concession, totaling more than 100 buildings, were originally the property of Junyi Company. Last year, the company sold more than 30 of the houses to a certain Mr. Xie at No. 768 Kangnaoni Road for a price of more than 170,000 yuan. After the new landlord took over, he forced the tenants to move out on the grounds that the houses needed to be renovated, and then announced rent increases. The tenants, having no choice, reluctantly increased their rent starting in April of this year, by 4 or 5 yuan per building. Less than half a year after the rent increase, the new landlord did not notify the tenants and demanded another rent increase starting in July. The tenants, considering the landlord's demands unreasonable, organized a tenants' union and elected representatives such as Shen Ditao and Wang Yonghua to negotiate reasonably, but without success. Landlord Xie commissioned lawyer Wang Jianfan to file a lawsuit against the tenants in the Second Special District Court. The tenants commissioned lawyer Zhu Yakui to represent them. After Judge Yu Jian opened court several times to hear the case, the debate has already concluded. The plaintiff was recently ruled to have lost the case, and the litigation costs were borne by the plaintiff. Unexpectedly, because the landlord failed in the lawsuit and did not achieve the goal of raising the rent, he suddenly shut off the tap water to the houses starting on the 7th, preventing its use. The tenants are now taking countermeasures and notifying all sectors of society to request fairness and provide assistance, hoping for an early resolution.</p>
<h3>Bomb Explodes in Furnace, Injuring People</h3>
<p>The Huabei Foundry at No. 489 Gordon Road and Kangnaotu Road, opened by Ningbo native Chen Chunxiang, was melting scrap copper yesterday afternoon at around 4:00 PM when a bomb was accidentally mixed into the furnace. With a loud bang, Chen's left waist and left arm were injured on the spot, and an apprentice, Qiu Shutao, 19 years old, was also injured in the left arm and collapsed. People summoned an ambulance to send them to Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Sued for Huge Debt, Wufeng Silk Company Loses Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Chen Chenqing, He Shoufan, Li Xizhen and others jointly established the Wufeng Silk Company. In June of this year, due to buying and selling a huge amount of US dollar foreign exchange, they owed the Zhongyong Foreign Firm more than 260,000 yuan in French currency and were unable to repay it. Zhongyong Foreign Firm hired lawyers Xu Shihao and Rong Zhenlong to file a lawsuit with the Shanghai First Special District Court. Judge Mo has concluded several hearings of the case, the details of which have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Mo ascended the bench in the Second Court and read out the main text of the judgment. The defendant, Wufeng Company, should repay the plaintiff 266,782.57 yuan in French currency, and interest at an annual rate of 5% from July 1 of this year to the date of execution. If the assets of Wufeng Company are insufficient to repay the debt, the defendants Chen Chenqing, He Shoufan, and Li Xizhen shall be jointly and severally liable for the repayment. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant, Wufeng Company.</p>

<h3>Japanese Ship "Daini Tenri Maru" Returning from Hankou to Shanghai Robbed, Sailed into the Huangpu River at Midnight and Suddenly Encountered a Riding Robbery, One Japanese Person Was Beaten and Injured, One Thrown into the River</h3>
<p>The "Daini Tenri Maru" of the Japanese trading company Okudi Trading Company returned to Shanghai from Hankou the day before yesterday (the 10th). At 11:30 PM that evening, when it sailed into the Songkou and reached the river surface of the Huazhong Water and Electricity Branch Power Plant in the Huangpu River, the engine room leader of the ship, Wu Nian'gen, suddenly braked and stopped the ship. At that time, a Japanese employee of the ship, Takao Ichiro, not knowing why, wanted to go and inquire, but when he went outside the engine room, he was suddenly beaten to the ground with iron bars by several other sailors and others on the ship. At the same time, another Japanese employee, Michiwaki Akihiro, was also captured, tied with hemp ropes, and thrown into the Huangpu River. Then, more than 5,000 yuan in cash brought from Hankou on the ship was robbed, and the perpetrators fled without a trace. Later, Takao and others were rescued by others. After the Japanese side received the news, they rushed to send them to the Sasaki Hospital in Hongkou for treatment. Now the Japanese side believes that the case is bizarre and has dispatched detectives everywhere to thoroughly investigate all employees of the ship. I am publishing a lost and found notice in the news column on behalf of all family members to be reunited. I am grateful for this service.

<h3>The Image to the Right Shows a Photo of Admiral Li Jiesun, Commander-in-Chief of the National Navy, Reviewing Troops in the Pacific Ocean</h3>
<h3>New Weapons of the American Navy</h3>
<p>Since the last World War, European and American countries have been endlessly inventing new weapons. In the air force, this war has featured dive bombers and "airborne infantry" using parachutes. In the army, there are tanks that can destroy strong defenses like snapping dead branches. The navy seems to have featured fewer new inventions, but Germany and Italy have invented a small, high-speed torpedo boat in addition to pocket battleships, launching torpedoes in the vast ocean amidst turbulent waves. It is said that its destructive power is extremely great, and even large ships cannot escape its impact. The construction and use of this type of small torpedo boat are kept quite secret in Germany and Italy, so few people know its true nature. The United States Navy Department initially doubted the capabilities of these small boats, but during the Abyssinian War, they saw Italy use these small, fast boats to demonstrate against the British Navy in the Mediterranean. More recently, during the Battle of Dunkirk, it was claimed that the German forces used these small torpedo boats and aircraft to sink or damage as many as twenty-one British escort ships. As a result, the United States also rushed to catch up, manufacturing them in large quantities, with a "mosquito boat" fleet expected to be completed by early 1942. (See photo)</p>
<p>The so-called "mosquito boat" fleet refers to the small and exquisite nature of these fast torpedo-launching boats. From stem to stern, they are only about one hundred and ten feet long, equipped with four torpedo launchers and four machine guns. In addition to the captain, they can carry seven or eight sailors. Their speed reaches up to forty nautical miles per hour. When sailing on the water, they can turn left and right, advancing and retreating freely. Therefore, even if aircraft bomb from above, not only is the target smaller, but their agile, snake-like movements and rabbit-like speed make it difficult to hit the boat. These fast boats may appear insignificant compared to giant cruisers, but the four torpedoes they carry are already half the power of ordinary torpedo boats, and their cost is only about one-thirtieth of the cost of a torpedo boat.</p>
<p>These torpedo fast boats will be a new weapon for the American Navy, and their command and driving will be entrusted to new talents in the navy. Because driving these agile and versatile fast boats requires young people with quick thinking and agile hands and feet to be successful. Therefore, the commander of this "mosquito boat" fleet, although a senior torpedo expert, is very young, only around thirty years old, making him arguably the youngest officer in the American Navy. The captains of each boat are even younger, with many having graduated less than six or seven years ago, and the phrase "still have a childlike heart" can be used to describe their demeanor. This is an unconventional "appointment" in the traditional spirit of the American Navy.</p>
<p>The designer and builder of this "mosquito boat" fleet for the United States is not a veteran of the naval community, but a progressive businessman. His name is Henry Sutphen, and he is currently sixty-five years old. He is the Vice President of the Electric Boat Company of Groton. He has a progressive mind and a spirit of courage and perseverance. He rose from a small errand boy to become the manager of the company. With new designs, he created the mass production of yachts. Over the years, even middle-class families have been able to enjoy the pleasures of yachting. The first American ship to use a diesel engine was a product of the company managed by Sutphen.</p>
<p>In early 1915, German submarines roamed the seas, creating unprecedented terror in the Atlantic. The British government representative asked Sutphen for advice on how to resist them. Sutphen replied, "A team of small fast boats would be good." The design of submarine chasers originated from this. Before the war, Sutphen's company built about twelve of these boats each year. However, he told the British government representative, "We can build one every day." British shipyards and naval expert advisors all said this was impossible. But the Navy Department trusted Sutphen's words and asked him to give it a try. Sutphen and his designers worked hard and, in the end, built 550 submarine chasers in 448 working days.</p>
<p>Later, when the United States entered the war, Sutphen also contributed his secret to building submarine chasers to the country. He also used standardized methods to complete the mass production of transport ships. The speed of building steel-hulled ships was like a tailor sewing clothes. The method of shipbuilding was to first manufacture uniform parts, and then assemble them one by one according to the drawings. In an instant, a ship could be assembled successfully, just like a child assembling a toy ship.</p>
<p>When the last European war ended, Sutphen resumed his old business. The submarine chasers he supervised were sold by the government to civilians and converted into fishing boats and ferries. At that time, the US government had not yet thought of forming a "mosquito boat" fleet. It was not until 1938 that the small fast boats of Italy and Germany began to attract the attention of the US naval authorities. However, many conservative naval officers still focused on battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, and scoffed at the power of these small fast boats. But some senior officers did not think so and finally decided to build a "mosquito boat" fleet. President Roosevelt has even requested Congress to pass a construction fund of $1.5 million.</p>
<p>The Navy Department plans to complete this fleet between 1941 and 1942. Trial boats have been built and are being tested in the field. In the future, the strengths and weaknesses of each boat will be gathered, and the final, most perfect one will be used as the standard for mass production. Therefore, although the Navy Department already has this type of fast boat, there is still considerable time before the formation of the fleet. When it is formally used in the future, its production will be like the gathering and disturbance of mosquitoes in late autumn and summer.</p>
<p>The company managed by Sutphen won the bid to build these boats, and his design of a one-hundred-ten-foot fast boat is already being tested. In early 1939, Sutphen saw the war clouds gathering in Europe and could not help but feel uneasy about the completion of the "mosquito boat" fleet in 1942, fearing that it would still be lacking in actual operational capabilities. To respect Sutphen's opinion, the Navy Department sent him to England for observation. He was most impressed by the seventy-foot-long fast boat designed by the famous British speedboat racer Scott-Paine. This boat has a streamlined shape, a flat bottom, and can travel at forty to fifty miles per hour. Even when sailing on rough seas, the shaking is relatively slight. Its ease of use and flexibility are its characteristics. It can carry four torpedoes, several machine guns, and is powered by a powerful Rolls-Royce engine. Because its hull is wide, the space below the deck is more than enough for one officer and seven sailors.</p>
<p>Sutphen immediately purchased one boat for $300,000 and negotiated with Scott-Paine for the right to manufacture them in the United States. After returning to the United States, he invited Navy Department personnel to try it out, and everyone was satisfied. Sutphen guaranteed that he could build twenty-five of these fast boats by the spring of 1941 and use this as the blueprint for mass production in the future. The Navy Department agreed to his proposal and began to implement it. To date, the boats being tested have been successively built. If necessary, the shipbuilding speed can still be increased. According to predictions from within the Navy Department, the United States can complete a fleet of two hundred of these "mosquito boats" within two years.</p>
<p>Naval experts believe that motor torpedo boats have many wonderful uses. The most obvious is like the German use of dive bombers. They can rush to the enemy's position before the attacking forces. If they encounter aircraft carriers, the torpedoes they launch can have the greatest effect. During the day, they attack enemy ships like a flash of sunlight, acting with extraordinary speed and agility. At night, they can also spy on enemy ships, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, making it difficult for people to detect them. They can also attack seaports, drive away submarines, attack enemy ships in narrow waters and shallow harbors, and can also be used for patrol and reconnaissance. These are all the advantages of small motor torpedo boats.</p>
<h3>General Tagore Inspecting French Troops in England</h3>
<h3>American Navy Tank</h3>
<p>The United States Navy Department has recently ordered a number of amphibious tanks (see image), which can travel freely both in water and on land, climbing slopes and traversing forests. After observing the trial of this vehicle, officials of the United States Navy Department believe that it is quite useful and can be used to transport soldiers and military supplies ashore from warships when landing is difficult. This type of amphibious tank can carry forty soldiers, and its speed is twenty-five miles per hour on land and eight and a half miles per hour on water. The gears on both sides of the vehicle are quite wide, allowing it to travel on mudflats as if on flat ground.</p>
<h3>Turning Point in the Battle of Britain</h3>
<p>The outcome of the first year of the European war has created a situation in which a continental landmass is held in check by an island nation. Just a few months ago, the situation was exactly the opposite. At that time, the British Isles were in dire straits, facing the danger of being overwhelmed by the German mechanized power from the mainland at any moment. At that time, Britain, and the entire Western world behind it, whose situation was no less precarious than Britain's, had wide-open doors, unable to stop the rapid onslaught of the National Socialist Party's large-scale forces of fire and steel. From the Pyrenees to the North Cape, the entire Atlantic coast of Europe was menacingly eyed by the giant of German mechanized military equipment, ready to pounce on that "small island nation of Britain" from land, sea, and air.</p>
<p>Today, although there is little change on the surface, the battle situation is completely different. The military situation seems to be largely unchanged. The same rapid forces of the National Socialist Party, in the urgent weeks, used unbelievable blitzkrieg tactics, bombing, burning, killing, and capturing Poland, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France—these same bomber squadrons and millions of assembled motorized troops are still lurking menacingly on the European coast they have captured.</p>
<p>But the situation is no longer the same. Britain has now contained National Socialist Germany and its ally, Fascist Italy, at least as tightly as it is being contained itself. After a year of hard fighting, Britain has now taken the offensive in two of the three aspects of sea, land, and air, namely the sea and air. This is an undeniable fact. As for the land aspect, it will take some time to form an attacking force.</p>
<p>To understand the true picture of the military situation, it is necessary to compare the current situation with the situation at the end of June. At the end of June, France had already collapsed, and the armistice treaty signed with Germany allowed German forces to occupy the northern half of the country and the entire Atlantic coast. French naval bases fell into German hands, and the French fleet was in danger of being seized by the Germans at any moment. At that time, the fate of Britain seemed hopeless. British military experts now admit that if the German forces had launched a full-scale attack at that time, the British resistance would have been questionable. Even Prime Minister Churchill's public speeches revealed his intention to retreat to Canada and continue fighting. The perilous nature of the situation can be imagined.</p>
<p>In that dark week at the end of June, reporters and many neutral observers discussed the overall situation, and all but two expressed pessimism about Britain's future. When I asked them again last week (early September), their answers were completely different. All but one or two expressed optimism about Britain's future, believing that it was impossible for German forces to invade the British Isles, and that any attempt would certainly fail.</p>
<p>What is the reason for this turning point in the battle situation? One is that 200,000 British troops were able to evacuate from Dunkirk back to the country; the second is that the British Navy resolved the issue of the French fleet; and the third is that the British Air Force was able to cope with large-scale German bombing and was able to strike back forcefully. US Secretary of the Navy Knox once said that Britain's chances of victory have increased to 50%, but the British are confident that they will win the final victory.

<h3>How to Deal with Tests</h3>
<p>— Wu Yusheng</p>
<p>In the next week or two, various schools will be holding monthly tests. Dear children, how should you prepare before the test? What attitude should you have during the test? And how should you reflect after the test? Everyone should pay attention to these questions!</p>
<p>(1) Preparation before the Test Most children often do not prepare much for tests, simply resorting to last-minute cramming. We should not emulate these self-defeating children. We should first roughly review the content of all subjects, and then carefully study each lesson separately, extracting the key points of each lesson, and thinking of questions to ask ourselves to dispel doubts. If there are any unclear points, ask the teacher immediately, making sure that we can clearly understand all the lessons. It is best not to review the books again a few hours before the test, as this will only disturb our thoughts and tire our minds. We should instead organize our research findings into systematic, orderly, and organized materials. At this time, our minds need to be clear, and our attitude needs to be calm; only then can we cope with ease!</p>
<p>(2) Attitude during the Test There are two things to pay attention to most during the test: one is honesty, and the other is efficiency. Honesty means relying entirely on our own judgment and understanding. If we cannot answer a question, we must not discuss it privately, only seeking the score at the moment and losing the true meaning of the test, so this is something to pay attention to. As for efficiency, it means considering the economy of time, giving full play within the prescribed time, and not getting stuck on one question, focusing only on that question, wasting time, which is very unfortunate. Therefore, if we encounter a difficult question, we may as well put it aside for the time being, first do all the ones we know how to do, and then carefully study that question to find a correct answer, so as not to affect the overall score!</p>
<p>(3) Reflection after the Test After the test, we should make a reflection. How was the result of this test? What are the reasons for the failure? We must carefully reflect on the test process. If we have found any shortcomings, then immediately resolve to work hard to improve next time. Everyone should not think that after the test, we can simply let things go. (Remuneration donated)</p>
<h3>Three Types of Students</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>I remember a friend telling me a story about three types of students. Whether they are elementary school students, middle school students, or college students, they all fall within these three categories. So what are the names of these three types? Let me tell you slowly:</p>
<p>The first type is the spring type: This type of student is like the Baotu Spring in Jinan, the Huishan Spring in Wuxi, the Hupao Spring in Hangzhou, or, on a smaller scale, a well in a family, absorbing water drop by drop from all parts of the earth, filtered by mud and sand, becoming a spring that never dries up, inexhaustible. This type of student can automatically seek knowledge from all aspects, and can transform one piece of knowledge and understanding from all aspects, through their own selection and research, into their own true knowledge and understanding, so this type of student is the best.</p>
<p>The second type is the parrot type: This type of student is like a parrot. The teacher spends a lot of energy teaching them something, and they also spend a lot of energy learning something; what they know will not be more than what the teacher knows, but will only be less than what the teacher teaches. This type of student can only be considered average.</p>
<p>The third type is the funnel type: The funnel-type student is the worst, it can be said that this type of student is the lowest of the low. No matter how difficult or easy the lessons they learn, no matter how much they learn, they always leak everything out completely, like a funnel. In other words, this type of student learns something and forgets something, learns how much and forgets how much.</p>
<p>Children! Which of the three types of students above do you like to be? I think you will definitely raise your hands in unison and say, "I want to be the spring type!" Well then! Let's all work hard!</p>
<h3>The Consequences of Eating Snacks</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhen</p>
<p>Hui is a child who likes to eat snacks. Whenever he comes home from school, he clamors for his mother to buy him something to eat. Seeing that he has worked hard all day in class, his mother will of course not refuse, and will hand him a few fractional bills. A Hui then runs off in a puff of smoke. Because he eats a lot of snacks, especially candy, he often has toothaches. Whenever his teeth hurt, he shakes his head and swears that he will never eat so much candy again. But as soon as the toothache goes away, he is holding candy again.</p>
<p>One evening, A Hui's toothache flared up again. A Ming—his older brother—smiled and said to him: "This is the result of eating too much candy. You see, I usually don't eat many snacks other than three meals a day, so I have never tasted the pain of a toothache. Candy is delicious, but unfortunately, eating too much causes toothache, which is not good. You should know that eating less candy does help our body digest, but eating too much is not only useless, but in addition to toothache, it can cause teeth to change from hard to soft, because eating too much candy makes the blood easily acidic. If the blood is acidic, it must be excreted from the body immediately, so it passes to the intestines. The acid stimulates the intestinal wall, easily causing various acute enteritis. But to make the excretion of acid harmless to the body, it must be neutralized with alkaline substances and transformed into a non-irritating salt. The source of alkaline substances, in addition to the supply in the blood, depends on the teeth, thus causing the teeth to soften. But teeth must be hard, because they are a sharp tool for chewing food. If they become soft, how can that work? If teeth are not healthy, it can lead to indigestion and stomach problems, and even the danger of death."</p>
<p>"Then how can we protect our teeth?"</p>
<p>"Protecting our teeth is very important for our health. If we don't protect them properly, the consequences can be terrible. However, teeth also have many shortcomings: (1) Part of the tooth is made of enamel, so the tooth is very hard, but enamel is easily dissolved when it encounters acid. But in our mouths, there is a special microorganism that can produce acid, so we easily get cavities. (2) Once enamel is consumed, it can never be repaired naturally, unlike other parts of the body that can recover after being injured. Then germs take the opportunity to enter the body through cavities. As the saying goes: "Disaster comes from the mouth, illness enters from the mouth." It's not wrong at all, and some diseases also enter from cavities. (3) Once teeth have grown, they no longer grow, so even if the body develops, the teeth still maintain their original state, so we must pay special attention when changing teeth, otherwise the teeth will not be arranged neatly, which can easily cause disease. As for the protection of teeth, we must also pay attention to three points: (1) We should be very careful in choosing food, that is, eat more vegetables and fruits, and on the one hand, get more sun exposure. (2) We should chew food carefully, which can make the teeth and skull develop, and on the other hand, make food easier to digest. Careful chewing can prevent cavities, because when chewing, the mouth is in motion, so that food does not stay on the tooth surface and in the gaps between teeth. (3) We should brush our teeth before going to bed, and it is best to do so after eating, but at least twice a day, morning and evening. Because the oral cavity is closed during sleep, the air does not circulate, so if the mouth is not clean, germs will easily multiply and cause cavities. So eating more snacks is not good for the body, and it also wastes money, losing in two ways. Why ask for trouble?"</p>
<h3>Potpourri</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Small ability is unable to shoulder heavy responsibilities, not unable to do things. Being able to hold on to this concept, the children's essence is also exhausted.</p>
<p>A Western philosopher once said: "Childhood represents adulthood, just as morning represents daytime." These two sentences can be used as a motto for children.</p>
<h3>Shirley Temple's Autobiography (18)</h3>
<p>— Mine</p>
<p>If I kept all the gifts people gave me, our house would be so full, there wouldn't even be room to live. So, we often take them to hospitals or charities for sick and poor children to play with. But there are some gifts that I absolutely don't want to give away. For example, the five rabbits that Mr. Sheehan gave me for Easter. I was so happy, I specially built a wire mesh enclosure in the garden behind the "Dream House" on the studio lot for them to live in. And the pair of twin  that Jamie Dunn gave me; they still live in that big glass tank, and I cherish them very much and don't want to give them away, especially since my name is painted on their backs. Besides, there is also a fluffy little dog named Lottie, which was a lovely Christmas present. These little creatures are the ones I often play with every day.</p>
<p>Honey, you should know that you yourself are a gift! When you were very, very small, a good friend of Mommy's gave you to me. If I casually gave you away to someone else, how would you feel in your heart? Wouldn't you be very sad? As for your name, "Honey", do you know what it means? It's just because your head is round, like a small cork. The sound of "cork" is "ke ke," so I called you "Honey."</p>
<p>Oh, my dolls are so beautiful, like many noble ladies all dressed up, going to some banquet or dance! Do you know how many I have in total? Twenty-eight in total, and they are all my most cherished ones that I don't want to give away. When we moved to the new house, Mommy specially gave me a room so that these twenty-eight dolls could also have a place to stay. A carpenter was called to build a glass cabinet on one wall of the room, with wooden shelves divided into several layers inside. The dolls are displayed inside, some sitting on the shelves, their long clothes spread out, covering their knees, and some standing, looking very handsome. They seem to be looking at me every day through the glass windows of the small house. I also rarely take them out, unless there is some gathering with friends, then I take them out to join in the fun. If older people come to our house, I have to take them to see my dolls, and if someone wants to see them in more detail, then I have to take them out.</p>
<p>I also have several "Shirley Temple" dolls, their faces and clothes are very similar to mine! I don't know if they are learning from me, or I am learning from them. There is also a rubber baby doll that cries sadly, and a pair of colored dolls that can do tricks on a wooden bar, which is much more fun than my two older brothers playing on the horizontal bar in the garden.</p>
<p>Among the many people I know, the one who gives me the most gifts is Mr. Sheehan. His biggest and best gift is the bungalow in the studio called "Dream House," which really made our whole family very grateful. Now let me tell you the story of this matter. When children are around five years old, they always get sleepy in the afternoon. Even if you are working on a new film, you can't help but close your eyes, so you have to take a nap. Originally, I could lie down on the work table, or lie down next to Mommy, or take a nap on the couch in the dressing room. But the people around me didn't know I was dozing off and kept talking loudly with people: or the carpenters were building scenery and hammering; or the musicians were rehearsing singing for people and suddenly started playing music. This commotion woke me up.</p>

<h3>Appraisals of Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— A Yin</p>
<p>In ancient times, people liked to comment on famous figures in the contemporary art world to learn from each other, such as the "Appraisals of Opera" and "Appraisals of New Romances" written by people in the Ming Dynasty. Based on my personal observations, I have also made separate appraisals of modern movie stars, either symbolizing their technical performance or symbolizing their personality. I call them "Appraisals of Movie Stars." Although they are just a few words, they are very thought-provoking. The order in which they appear is based on the author's random recollection, without any distinction between good or bad. Readers should take note of this!</p>

<h3>Visiting Professor Zhao Meibo</h3>
<p>— Ye Zhi</p>
<p>Professor Zhao Meibo is an authority in the Chinese music world. Everyone knows that he is a musician with extremely high accomplishments and enjoys a great reputation in Europe and America. After returning to China, he served as the director of the vocal music group at the National Conservatory of Music. He is a lifelong learner and can patiently guide students into the right path of art. For example, the famous film singers Ms. Lang Yuxiu and Ms. Cheng Jingzi, as well as the conductors of various churches such as Ge Chaozhi, Xia Xun'an, and Tian Mingsi, are all students of Professor Zhao.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that Professor Zhao is preparing to hold a student concert, and I made a visit to get more information. According to him: "In order to enable my students to practice more, know more, and understand more about art, as well as to have more contact with people from the outside world, I have always attached great importance to this matter, and I also hope to gradually take on the responsibility of improving the musical level of the Chinese audience by ourselves. We must work hard, and I hope that all sectors will give us more encouragement and guidance." It is also known that Professor Zhao has specially invited the chief conductor of the Municipal Council Orchestra, Mei Boqi, Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the presidents of St. John's, Soochow and Hangchow Universities, as well as well-known people from society and music experts to be sponsors, in order to support Zheng Jun. The time is 9 pm on the 12th, and the location is the American Women's Club at 522 Jing'an Temple Road. All are vocal music programs, and most of the songs sung are selected from famous operas. People who love music believe that it is worth a listen.</p>

<h3>Li Qinian's contract signed last night</h3>
<p>— Hai Xing</p>
<p>Annual salary reportedly over 30,000 yuan</p>
<p>The matter of Yi Hua signing a three-year long-term contract with Li Qinian has been brewing for a long time. Li Qinian has been hesitant because she is unwilling to give up the Hong Kong market. It is now learned that Yi Hua has given Li Qinian a satisfactory reply on this point, and the long-term contract was signed at 8 pm last night. As for the remuneration, both parties are unwilling to disclose it. According to relevant sources, the large annual salary is 30,000 to 40,000 yuan, and the additional remuneration has not yet been included. Such a salary may be an innovation in the country, but Yi Hua believes that Li Qinian's works are particularly appealing in the Nanyang area, so it is willing to sign a contract with a huge salary.</p>
<p>Hawthorne's Detective Cases</p>
<h3>The Destination of the Dance Queen</h3>
<p>— Written by Cheng Xiaoqing</p>
<p>Hawthorne nodded and a smile flickered across his lips. Xu San then escorted the young man out. Hawthorne didn't see him off. After a while, the sound of a car outside the door sounded, clearly indicating that Yu Gantang had been escorted back. I didn't wait for Hawthorne to sit down. I was busy questioning Hawthorne.</p>
<p>I said, "Hawthorne, what about that Lu Jiansheng? I heard from Xu San that he has already left."</p>
<p>Hawthorne slowly sat down and replied, "Yes, I asked Ni Jinshou to let him go, to give him face."</p>
<p>I said in surprise, "Does this person have nothing to do with it?"</p>
<p>"I don't think so—in the situation, he wouldn't have beaten Wang Lilan to death. The tone of his voice when he spoke later also gave me the same impression."</p>
<p>"But the attitude you took towards him in the police station is not consistent with what you are saying now."</p>
<p>The meaningful smile on Hawthorne's lips reappeared. "That was a reaction to his snobbish attitude. I wanted to kill his arrogance. You know that I hate snobbery and class consciousness the most!"</p>
<p>I also said, "But how do you explain his footprints? Aren't his round-toed leather shoes the same size as the footprints on the floor? Although he said that he didn't enter Lilan's house last night, how could his footprints be in the corpse's house?"</p>
<p>Hawthorne's smile suddenly disappeared, replaced by a pensive, frowning expression. He paused for a moment and said slowly: "This question cannot be explained yet, but it doesn't matter to let him go for the time being. He can't run away anyway."</p>
<p>His eyes lingered on the desk for a while, then he turned back to look at me and said, "Bao Lang, you also saw that the old man who looks after the door is also wearing a pair of leather shoes. Although the leather shoes are old and worn, they are also round-toed, and the size doesn't seem to be small. Isn't it?" (134)</p>
