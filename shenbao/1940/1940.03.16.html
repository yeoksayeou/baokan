<p>社評</p>
<h3>收容乞丐問題</h3>
<p>中國自遭外侮，人民顚沛流離者，何啻千百萬人。上海託庇於租界，雖八方多難，幸得瓦全，由是若水之歸壑，羣以上海爲尾閭；一方面造成目前崎形之繁榮，另一方面，但見躑躅街頭，踡伏道旁，無非饑餓綫上挣扎之流民。此不僅與市容有關，亦影響於治安匪細，本報固屢以爲言矣。曩見報載公共租界工部局有收容乞丐之計畫，徒以該局經費受早年納稅人年會決議之拘束，凡就地皮章程規定所徵收之經費，不准提撥作爲救濟用途，因之救濟乞丐計畫所需用費，不得不有賴於私人或公共之捐助。今雖由救世軍主持其事，亦苦於經費無著，故望公衆方面，爲其利害著想，設法籌措。工部局擬議及此，深信必爲本市各界所同情也。</p>
<p>此類經費之來源，若專靠公衆捐助。雖事出不得已，其勢殆難持久。蓋捐款出於各方樂助，故成績至難一定，而事業用費，歲有經常，自不能恃浮動之收入，作額定之支出。抑收容乞丐游民，上海各界人士早有所努力矣；以言其先，如棲流公所，爲庇風雨，爲療飢寒；又如閘北柳營路之淞滬敎養院，則以敎養游民乞丐爲事；常時皆每年各有補助經費，卒以款巨事艱，仍須仰給於捐款，而中道停頓。其在漕河涇則有上海慈善團所辦之游民習勤所，設備較善，復有經常的款可資，故按序進行，頗著成績。其後曾以遊民乞丐流浪街頭；非作大規模之規畫，不足以盡收容之效，乃擬創辦遊民工廠，惟是需款浩繁，知非公衆捐助所能成事，頗擬將北浙江路某堂塚地遷移，改建市廛，藉此大宗收入，作爲經常支應之挹注，乃因同治光緒間曾有糾紛，當時工部局擬將此塚地買作華童公學基地，爲紳士反對，遂又向工部局收回，但相的不得再作他用；於是此項規畫，復歸泡影。此收容乞丐之一問題，一波三折，屢興屢廢，及至目前，問題愈見繁重，解決不可或緩，遂不得不由工部局獨任其艱矣。</p>
<p>惟是收容乞丐，旣爲公衆之利益，自不妨責公衆以負擔；雖曰格於權限，而不能列爲工部局正開支，亦即不能以捐稅方式爲財源，然收容乞丐游民，其性質上非可視同救濟；蓋直接所以整飭市容，問接所以維持治安，故最筒捷之辦法，最合理之補救，莫如由工部局向納稅人會建議，即於市政經費項下撥付專款，作爲整飭市容之費，此則未可視爲逾越權限者也。此而不行，似可授權工部局向界內力能負担捐稅之士商，勸募一種有定期的收容遊民捐，以若干年爲限，過此則視其事業本身收益之多寡，能吾自給，再行酌减捐額或即停止之。此則收入較有定額，事業進行方有把握也。</p>
<p>若上所云云，未能見諸事實，則以救世軍之熱心毅力，自必獲有相當成效，然其勢惟有量力辦理，酌量收容，謂必期以克盡收容之能事，殆終不免有安得廣厦千萬間之歎乎？</p>
<h3>渝當局疏散人民　為預防日方之空襲　外使館不凖備遷移</h3>
<p>重慶　中國政府當局、鑒於去年五月、日本飛機侵襲行都時、重慶居民、於兩日內遭受日機轟炸而死傷者達五·〇一四人、茲爲避免重罹此禍起見、目前正實施積極辦法、以便疏散居民、當局之意、欲將居民自五十萬人减至八萬人、據負責當局聲稱、五月底重慶居民將减至二十五萬人、政府希望再减至十萬人或八萬人、查去年十一月間、重慶之人口、曾達六十萬人、至本年二月初、已减至五十五萬人、三月初、軍警當局以勸導及强迫手段又疏散居民十萬人、當局現擬於二星期內、再撤退居民二十萬人、如是則至三月底時、僅有二十五萬居民留住重慶矣、駐渝外國大使館七處、通知政府、謂彼等不擬遷移辦公室及住宅、外國（英美法蘇）大使四人、目前均在此間、此外尙有來自世界各處之外國傳敎士四十人、留住重慶、準備渝城被炸時、作援助救濟工作、渝市當局、卽已允許外國傳敎士留住於城中、目前重慶小康之家之主婦、多已撤離重慶、但彼等之丈夫、則留城中、又有一部份富庶之家、則已遷往川省西部、另一部決定移往河內或香港及馬尼拉等各地、「大公報」最近載稱、中國傳敎士中、有將家屬遷往美國者、過去十二月間、當局曾在渝市各山麓遍造隧道式之防空壕、此種防空壕、足以收容居民二十五萬人、但當局爲减少夏季空襲時居民之死亡率起見、僅允半數人民留住渝市、據息、全國救濟委員會全體委員、以及警察二千人、醫師及看護一千人、分駐急救醫院及急救所、準備於萬一日本飛機襲渝時、救濟受傷居民、自三月一日起、所有急救隊、包括僧侶多人、均從事隨時担任救護工作、居民撤退渝城後所赴之地、其中心點多爲渝城附近各鄉村、內有溫泉六處、婦孺撤往該處時、猶如「作假期旅行」、該處各鄕村之附近、設有小百貨商店、照相材料店、雜貨店及絲店、以應居民之需、聞重慶之商民及店主、爲自願撤退者之先鋒隊、良以彼等急欲在撤離區開設「分店」、幷避免「冷落行都」之不振市面、「大重慶」郊外新戲館、歌女及茶室之開設、如雨後春筍、進口貨物、僅能在鄕村購得之、因商人中、無人欲將珍貴商品留在城市商業區、以免被炸之虞、中國當局雖作種種準備、避免日機再襲重慶、然此間外國覜察家相信、倘今年日機再襲渝城、不至如去年之猛烈、去年日機空襲、在軍事方面、毫無成就、日機再炸重慶、亦不過再消耗昂貴汽油及炸彈而已、（十五日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>奇俊峯　謁蔣委員長　內蒙女英雄　抗戰著聲聞</h3>
<p>重慶　內蒙古某旗抗日健將奇俊峯女士、昨日抵陝北楡林、前來此間、晋謁蔣介石上將、奇女士爲蒙古歷史中率兵抗戰之第一英雄、奇女士二十歲出嫁於年齡四十一歲蒙古王公、結婚二載、遽賦文君新寡嗣後伊拒絕求婚者多起、目前伊擬擇良而配、一九三七年女士爲日兵所執、囚於伊之宮中、一年後伊逃往擁護國民政府之蒙古軍隊中、嗣後、伊爲蒙古警備司令、在蒙古歷史中、尙屬創舉、（十五日合衆社電）</p>
<h3>華利用駱駝　載運貨物</h3>
<p>重慶　此間多數專家、皆信中國經過二年又半之戰事後、其內地與外界間之最可靠及最經濟交通方法、仍爲數百年前之舊法、華人鑒於海岸被日海軍封鎖、鐵道公路常遭轟炸、汽油來源困難、及關於鐵道維持與卡車運用各項問題、現已在西北方面、使用駱駝載運來往蘇聯之貨物　並利用帆船駛行內地各河道、數世紀前之古道、而在鐵道公路造成後業經廢置者、現已有滿載貨物之車馬、來往其間、中國當局現對於昔日商旅來往之滇　　古驛道、已重行開關、不久卽將有運貨之車馬、出現於此人　人跡之道路、輸入中國所需之接濟品、而輸出中國之產物也、（路透社十五日電）</p>
<h3>美國人士觀察　日蘇衝突遲早難免　傳諾蒙亨附近又啓釁端　日軍部發言人聲明否認</h3>
<p>華盛頓據　此間人士觀察、蘇芬戰爭吿終之後、滿洲邊界一帶、蘇日兩軍必又將發生時斷時續之衝突、唯此項衝突未必將形成大規模之戰爭、蓋蘇聯在巴爾幹之地位、一時不致明朗化也、但蘇聯在巴爾幹之地位假若明朗化之後、則蘇聯或將對日採取攻勢、亦未可知、據蘇方稱、蘇聯今次之攻擊芬蘭、目的在保護列寗格勒、但此項理由亦適用於遠東方面、換言之、蘇聯假若保護海參崴之安全時、則對滿洲沿邊亦可作全綫之進攻也、至於今後之小衝突、則大可牽制日軍在華之行動也、（十五日合衆電）</p>
<p>香港　據尙未徵實之消息、蘇聯日本兩國軍隊又在諾蒙亨地方附近發生衝突、蘇軍聞已深入「滿洲國」境內五英里之遙、且正在　續推進中、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>朱家驊論歐戰　對華並無不利（續）　中國外交運用遊刃有餘　且負世界和平重要使命</h3>
<p>三·實力的比較</p>
<p>在我們分析各交戰國的經濟現狀之先、先將雙方的人力檢討一下、現時處於主角地位的英法兩國本國的人口、共有八千四百萬、其屬地的人口、雖然可以動員、但非主要、可不必計、這樣、較諸上次大戰減少了帝俄的一萬七千萬、意大利的四千餘萬、和美國的一萬二千萬、在德國方面、自兼併奧捷以來、捷人除外、人口是八千萬、較諸上次大戰、則減少保加利亞和土耳其的人口、但以視上次幾乎全世界人都與德國為敵的情形、這次德國在人力上顯然佔了便宜、至於當交戰國雙方都在努力爭取興國的時候、將來人力的比較如何、此刻是難斷言的、</p>
<p>人力如此、以言物力、英法是佔了絕對的優勢、德國自上次戰敗之後、他的現金外匯和海外投資、較戰前已經是一落千丈、近數年來雖自動解除了凡爾賽條約的束縛、但戰後十年履行該約的結果、以及五年來無限度的擴軍、已經是羅掘俱窮、較之一九一四年那種世人所不及料富庶情形、誠不勝今昔之感、簡單的說、在去年九月以前、德國國民的生活情形、早已在戰時狀態中了、統計數字並告訴我們、英國不能自給自足的物資、實在太多、例如糧食一項、雖經戰後在農業上不斷的努力和四年計劃的成功、亦僅做能到自給之百分之八十五此外、須由南斯拉夫保加利亞羅馬尼亞諸國輸入雜糧、脂肪尤為缺乏、百分之五十奧捷所有在內、只有三百萬噸的產量、不敷數須靠羅馬尼亞和蘇聯的供給、軍事工業所必需的銅鐵砂等、雖有出產不足、或購自南斯拉夫、或得之於瑞典、紡織工業的原料、要從南非洲澳洲輸進羊毛、從美國巴西埃及印度輸進棉花、而這些平時國民生活所賴戰時軍隊給養所需的物品、除了一部份還可取自中立的臨國之外、大部份來源、便要受英法優越海軍封鎖的影響、馴至斷絕供給、</p>
<p>英法擁有充裕的物力、是不用說的了、以言財力、亦復如是、拿德國所有與英法相較、實在相差太遠了、英法兩國的存金和國外投資、共有一百四十一萬八千萬、德國僅有一萬三千萬、而每人每年收入的平均額、在德國僅有六十二鎊、這又可說明每一個英國人在財力上對國家的貢獻、較每一德國人幾多一倍、</p>
<p>四　德蘇關係</p>
<p>德國和英法的經濟情況相較、既有相形見絀之概、那麼他爲什麽把握支持這次戰爭呢、速戰速決嗎、似乎希特勒並沒有這個妄想、惟其如是、所以他當開戰的前夕、翻然改計、與政治上主義上的敵人蘇聯言歸於好、成立了互不侵犯條約及商約、因為明知速戰速決為客觀事實所不許、則惟有接納外援、尤希望蘇聯給予經濟上的援助、俾斯麥曾在「思想與回憶」書中、把德國同時在東西兩方面作戰的危險、昭告他們的國人、威廉二世本遵守這個遺言、與帝俄為仇、結果是失敗了、希特勒有鑒於此、所以有突然的轉變、消極上既可免除顧東之憂、積極上更可獲得經濟上的奧援、這不能不算是不智、而為同盟國所痛惡的、但是蘇聯所能再經濟上供給德國、究竟能到什麽程度和什麽限制呢、</p>
<p>蘇聯的對德接濟、首先有了心理因素的阻礙、德蘇兩國在目下固然是相互為用及相得益彰了、但蘇聯不願見德國在歐洲貿然取得領導地位、則不容諱言、所以幾度盛傳德蘇訂立軍事攻守同盟、只是空氣與宣傳作用、至少在現階段尚無實現的可能、準是推論、政治上的原因便難免影響到政治上的連繁成份、何况蘇聯近年來的生產量、縱然比從前增加了四倍、但因本國人民生活水準的提高和需要的增加、能輸往國外的剩量並不大、德國雖然善用他的信用借貸、以增進對蘇聯的貿易、從而更希望把握着蘇聯的貿易、（一九三九年八月十九日成立的商務協定即以此為基礎）雖然因為一九二六年有對蘇二萬萬馬克的借款、一九三二年有所謂畢亞達哥夫條約Piatakov以及一九三五年再有二萬萬馬克的借款、使德國在蘇聯的進口貿易上增加至百分之四十七、亦即德國總出口百分之二十四、雖然希特勒對此亦曾自豪地說過、以前可做到的、現在更可做到、還可不斷增加、然而蘇聯的對德輸出、目的在換取德國的工業生產品、此項工業品却為德國本身戰時所亟需、並無偌大剩餘、德國工業的負担既已沉重、在勢已到了不能如期交互的境地、因而以貨易貨政策的前途、不能在德蘇那方面、實不容許樂觀、遽言現金交易呢、（未完）</p>

<h3>中學生生活指導（二）</h3>
<p>— 汪懋祖</p>
<p>（三）「警惕及反省」過去社會上一般領導青年的人們、為喚醒民衆起見、誠然要非常激昂、盡情刺激、期獲速效、但他們所取方法、發生了許多流弊、致養成虛驕、浮躁的習性、失却沉着堅忍的德操、只使感情奔放、而所謂動心忍性、已不可復見、並且青年過度興奮之後、一經挫折、便易趨於頹喪、現在受到空前艱苦的教訓、知道抗戰建國、決非虛驕的呼喊、感情的叫囂所能濟事、所以負責指導的人們、也應當覺悟、一方面要將國家危急存亡、時時向學生申警惕厲、而一方面要使學生把歷史的因果、自身的責任、時時反省、養成沉着堅忍的精神、這種品性、是抗戰建國過程上最需要的、</p>
<p>（四）「鍛鍊及節制」、體格的鍛鍊、本含有精神的鍛鍊、大抵體格强健的人、能夠吃苦、可以控制衝動、戰勝困難、體弱的、固然吃不起苦但現在證明强健的也未必能吃苦、且未必能節制情欲、弱者適得其反、其故因為往日的體育、徒逞新奇、在都市上錦標式的訓練、且一般體育教員、對於人生學科的陶冶、實在太差、這便是精神鍛鍊與體格相離、刻苦是一種習慣、一般的體育運動、大都重加培養技能、與此種習慣無關、現在要從體育方面注重鍛鍊刻苦的習慣、從衛生方面、鍛鍊情欲的節制、但鍛鍊方法。仍須參考個人健康的狀况、逐步推進、由勉强而自然、</p>
<p>（五）「懲罰與裁制」懲罰本是一種消極的方法、要使用得當、使學生明了所以受罰的原因、而自知改悔、學生畏懼同學的批評、要比學校記過為甚、所以同學間輿論的指摘、大可用為一種裁制的方法、不過青年人感情偏倚往往有不合理的、所以要利用同學裁制、必須教導學生對於是非、有正確的判斷、</p>
<p>第四·生活指導的準則</p>
<p>生活指導、原很繁瑣、本文不過說明一些原則、茲分為兩大綱如下、</p>
<p>（甲）一般生活的指導</p>
<p>總裁說過、新生活就是現代國民的生活、也就是戰時的生活、新生活的六項原則一整齊、清潔·簡單·樸素·迅速·確實、都於軍人生活的要件和標準、一切教育的根本、就在教導一般國民實行新生活、又說「一般青年學生的生活習慣、不能改良、一切教育都要失敗」、以上種種話頭、是何等驚切、可見除根據新生活綱要外、實無所謂知道、現在中學內對於這六種標準、還不能完全切實做到、其實這六項標準、還不過是基本練習、更重要的是在深深的培養禮義廉恥的觀念、而後學生的品性、纔能强固、所以總裁在第三次全國教育會議內、親自提出禮義廉恥、作為全國一致的校訓、並說明「禮」是教訓國民互助合作、守紀律、中秩序、「義」是教訓國民任俠·果敢·負責任·肯犧牲、「廉」是教訓國民節約刻苦·別公私·明職分、「恥」是教訓國民自强自立·能奮鬥·知進取、當然、禮義廉恥不是敷衍精神講話、所能奏效、一定要從指點日常生活及參加團體活動、用上面所講各種方法、去指導啓發、例如要教導學生「負責任」一定要使學生在團體生活中、做一部分事、方得有責任的感覺、要教「廉」最好從愛護公務開始、要明「恥」當然從不良的行動及不及人的地方、去激發他的羞惡心、至於「禮」的教訓現在學校不過教導學生「有禮貌」「守秩序」還不過是一種外表、其實禮的精義、是一種人心的規範、在動機上即要自行辨別、不僅是要堅定學生外面的反應、且要訓練內心的反省、這種意思、現在教育者很少懂得了、</p>

<p>滬市整個燃料、前因水脚倍增、並現貨被人把持、致市價飛漲、旅館浴室熟水店均暫吿停業、或議增售價、平民開支無形增加、而各工廠因煤貴關係、成本加重、出品减少，毫無生色、尤爲滬市絕大之隱憂、茲因來源暢通、市塲現貨充斥、人心轉趨安定、並蘇芬停戰、大戶已無意猛吸、小戶觀望、市塲現貨鮮人問津、各項燃料售價步趨下落、况烟白煤塊間日抵埠、卸進煤棧、故煤塊存底亦與日俱增、茲煤業同業公會甫在辦理存煤登記、據悉已登記者、約達一萬餘噸、惟望各煤業行號迅往該會辦理登記手續、俾便統計、</p>

<h3>淪陷區各海關稅收被截　估計四萬三千萬元　中國目前不能償還各債　責任不在中國事極明顯</h3>
<p>中國政府對於維持債信、已早下有決心、自二十七年因淪陷區稅收被截、不得已對關稅擔保各債、另定償付辦法、僅爲臨時之現象、惟爲表明忠誠的用心計、凡在中國控制下海關、悉將應還外債部份之稅收、提存於中央銀行、並照法價折合外匯、至於被截留之關稅收入、存在日商橫濱正金銀行者、至去年底截止、總數的計四萬三千一百五十三萬元、此項存款、俟中日戰事結束後、方可解決、所以中國目前之不能償還關稅擔保之內外債、其責任實不在中國、本係極明顯之事實、茲錄二十七年二十八年主要各關被截之關稅、估計如下、（東三省各海關尙不在內）</p>

<h3>景昇輪沉沒一刹那　搭客器嘶叫慘絕人寰　當局設施疏忽實遺憾</h3>
<p>寗波景昇輪沉沒情形、昨據服務醫業界之詹君見吿、厥狀甚慘、於地方當道之設施疏忽、又不無微詞、爲　前毖後計、特紀述其情如左、</p>
<p>該輪梗概</p>
<p>據詹君談、寗波景昇輪總噸祗一六〇噸、船身長九十五尺、闊十六尺、深八尺、吃水六尺、造於一九〇四年、　馬力一五〇匹、每小時約能航九海哩、船底係尖形、並非平形、該輪最多載客數限制爲二百九十八人、該輪向來行駛寗波鎭海間、自寗波駁運公司成立後、頭加入爲駮運旅客船隻、往來於寗波及鎭海口間、</p>
<p>搭客情形</p>
<p>該輪於二日上午、自鎭海口駁載德平輪搭客抵甬、靠江北岸三北碼頭、搭客紛紛登岸、其時待乘謀幅輪旅客、均自僱渡船、駁至該輪外擋登艙、人數頗為擁擠、至一時五十分許、寗波防空監視哨發出空襲警報、爾時本人隨同戚友等四人、亦正懼渡船一艘、擬渡登該輪、駁乘謀福輪返滬、當渡船將靠近該輪船尾時、瞭見輪上旅客、已滿坑滿谷、船身殊有不勝負重之勢、因具戒心、不敢登輪、</p>
<p>失事一瞥</p>
<p>其時船夥尙從恿余等登輪、惟同船戚友亦同余見地、決改乘緩一班駁輪、飭船夥回棹、詎在一刹那間、該輪業已解纜、陡見輪身向外傾側、勢甚急銳、而全輪嚎哭叫囂之聲大作、厥狀悽厲、達於極點、不足二分鐘、該輪已沉入水底、當時哭叫之聲頓寂、台格及中艙門首旅客、頗有躍入附近渡船及水中、惟人數有限、其落入水中者、多不諳水性、即慘遭溺斃、當時情景之悽凉怵目、有非口舌所能形容、</p>
<p>責任所在</p>
<p>該輪沉沒後、約過一刻鐘、防空哨正續發緊急警報、惟日機亦已入境、約歷二十分鐘、警報始解除、其時軍警及救護團隊、均全體出動撈救、而新江橋上、亦擠滿閑看羣衆、情勢俄然緊張、此時余所乘渡船上、已有逃生旅客四人躍登、附載登岸、一船八命、慶生還也、詹君述及寗波駁運公司對載客限制、過於放任、航務當局、檢查不嚴、旅客本身、於公共秩序、缺乏紀律、深滋感嘆、蓋民衆非常時期之生命、不應作如是無謂孤注之犧牲、</p>
<p>懲前毖後</p>
<p>茲據本埠航業界消息、自寗波駁輪景昇號沉沒後、常局對於甬鎭間航輪駁載旅客之改善辦法、積極籌劃、寗波航運管理處暨軍政當局、除考慮在可能範圍內增多直航滬甬航輪外、將嚴格規定客貨駁載辦法、現已擬定實施辦法五項、（一）依據浙江省航運管理處規定、無論行駛內河外海之航輪、均須嚴予檢騐、（二）限制乘客人數、不得超過管理處及浙海關之規定、（三）裝貨重量、不得超過載重噸位、（四）旅客上下進出輪船、須分出入口、以維秩序、（五）由警務機關派員在各碼頭維持秩序、上項辦法、俟各機關商定後、即公佈實行、關於景昇沉輪屍體、善後委員會仍在繼續打撈、十四日上午又續獲男女屍體五具、</p>

<p>昨晚九時許、虞洽卿路品杳旅社門口、發生一槍殺案、被擊者即係麗都舞廳主人高鑫寳、當塲斃命、詳情錄後、</p>
<p>舞廳主人</p>
<p>本地人高鑫寳、年五十四歲、在上海社會中頗具一部份之潛勢力、前本住於赫德路一厦內、嗣因創辦麗都舞廳於麥特赫司脫路、故住宅亦即遷移於麗都內、</p>

<p>登車遇暴</p>
<p>昨晚七時左有、高即乘自備之第一一三一一號汽車至一品香、直候至九時半、友人尙米到齊、因之雀戰未成、至九時五十五分高起身而出、步出一品香、穿過馬路、正欲登車之際、詎暴徒已伺伏於跑馬廳短垣側一電桿旁、</p>
<p>彈中要害</p>
<p>暴徒見高至、突然躍出、拔槍向高連發三槍、均遭命中、高應聲倒地、血如泉湧、經附近崗捕趕到、將高舁入汽車、先送仁濟醫院、經醫生診察一過、計腹部中一槍、左耳槍、左腿一槍、立即施以急救、卒因傷中要害、流血過多、旋即斃命、</p>
<p>兇手逃逸</p>
<p>當時捕房得報飭派中西包探、馳往出事地點、緝捕兇手、巳逃逸無踪、當檢得空彈壳數隻候查、高之屍身將舁入騐屍所候騐、查高於去歲秋間、曾遭某方拘去、謂高有某種嫌疑、歷時旬日、始經釋出云、</p>

<p>美英滙兌再縮</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠期均回長〇六二五、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美滬法等各滙俱平、美對英縮五分一二五、對滬未更、對法小二分七五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價英金四辦士一二五、美匯六元三一二五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、開後投機商即來扒吸遠期、同時日洋行亦向期貨活動、且外行供意淡薄、惟英金幸匯豐對現貨仍肯供塞、期貨亦賴以站定、計投機商結進外行下月期美滙祇六元〇六二五、斯時現貨美滙亦僅有六元二五可結、但鮮乏做開滙豐掛牌揭曉、英平美縮〇六二五、白銀平衡稅揭曉升半分、此後大通某行首肯供售、旋踵小數浮多見景亦稍來出籠、故市象即吿轉穩、計某行吐予洋行下月份美匯六元一二五及投機商售予某行本月份美匯六元二五、後投機商續有賣予外行本月份美匯六元二八一二五、及下月期美匯六元一五六二五與一八七五、其時現貨價美滙亦回長至六元三七五可結、英金則仍站四辦士一二五、午刻賣者漸少、爲狀轉定、迄至收盤英金叫辦士一二五、美滙爲六元三四三七五、比晨開英平美長〇三二二五、期貨英美匯均比晨開爲硬、</p>
<p>美行亦懷賣意</p>
<p>後市初開平靜仍爲四辦士一二五、及六元三四三七五時日洋行曾來吸進、美行現貨美匯六元三四三七五、但無　響後因投機商復來稍吐、且市上忽起日蘇衝突傳言、故狀態續形硬化、計賣予外行本月份英余四辦士〇七八一二五、及本月份美滙六元三二一五、並又吐予有利下月期美滙六元二五、同時美行售予同行現貨美匯六元三七五、延至晚收、英金四辦士一二五、美匯六元三七五、本月份英金四辦士〇七八一二五、美滙六元三一二五、下月份英金四辦士〇一五六一五、美匯六元一八七五、結果比上日現貨英平美鬆〇三一二五、期貨英長〇三一二五、美硬○六　五、</p>

<h3>外幣大漲小回</h3>
<p>昨日外幣倏起反動、英美金鎊供給趨股、市價大漲小回、美金票變動劇烈、晨初因鎊價續降、市價挺升、爲十六元零五分、嗣後獲利供塞甚盛、市價轉弱、午間退爲十五元六角三分、晚市更降爲十五元五角、英金票先緊後鬆、結果未更、香港票羅比票需要驟稀、坎票跟隨微降、日金票稍弱、晚市爲一元二角九分半、朝鮮票益虛、晚市降爲九角八分、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱降二元、美金票降二角五分、香港票降五厘、羅比票降五分、坎票降一角、其他各幣未更、</p>

<h3>時過境遷　金市多頭乘高出籠　頭盤創五一七〇元空前高價　滙票稍長造成頭尾不接局面</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、情勢漸轉、佳景已遷、不若上數日之飛躍直上、原以外匯殊見穩定、經營者繼續看漲心思、當受挫折、且過去握貨者均獲厚利、滿懷了結之意、乘高紛紛出檔、爲數不小、全日中以現金號及證券帮拋出頂多、次者散湖售出、而客帮吃胃微薄、祇錢兌業仍見扒買活動、至全日過程、開盤尙高、但步撳步跌、遂感頭尾不接、頹勢頗形顯著、至晨開於競購之下、曾創見五千一百七十元空前高峯、嗣即各帮均出售於市、且斯時美滙轉硬、供過逾求、遂轉向下、迨午刻已盤小達五千零七十元、旋雖略見回高、顧以散戶復賣、又撳至五千零七十五元、牛後開市不久、再小十元、但其時某證券帮忽轉懷買意、力進有　、升至五千零九十七元、卒因斯時外　續報鬆硬、賣戶復臻、更以市上有日蘇衝突之謠傳、爭先脫售者至夥、迄至晚收前、遂現五千零三十元低盤、結果爲五千零三十三元、較上日回跌九十七元、全天交易的四千餘兩、銀樓飾金終則亦回小十元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌白元弱</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開承上日之餘威、且加美匯仍緊、氣仍非常熱烈、錢兌業等均放盤收買、致開市又橫跳四十元、某證券帮進銀號五十兩、爲五千一百七十元、詎科某現金號乘機出籠、再加另一證券帮亦來傾吐、情勢不支、下瀉六十元、現金號售予錢兌業五十兩、爲五千一百十元、此後某金號與某錢兌業忽來在撈、飛漲四十五元、錢兌業進證劵帮五十兩、爲五千一百五十五元、顧以美滙突報轉硬、人心向下、某銀號乃代散多拋賣、加之銀樓帮及證券帮等亦塞、重見暴跌七十五元、某銀號吐予錢兌業五十兩、爲五千零八十元、其時證券帮路有復進、且某銀樓亦來搜入、再又回升二十元、金號進某銀號五十兩、爲五千一百元、旋滙市復報硬、再起賣風、現金號錢兌業及證券帮等爭先猛塞、再撳二十元、證券帮出金號五十兩、爲五千零七十元、將近收盤時某銀號忽來復進、曾回起十八元、卒　錢兌業及某現金號再賣、復小至五千零七十五元作午收價、午後首山金號出某金號十兩、仍爲五千零七十五元、少頃錢兌業吐予證券帮一十兩、遜爲五千零六十五元、其時某證券帮突來吸收三百餘兩、頓被拉起三十二元、銀號進錢兌業二十兩、爲五千零九十七元、後外匯美金報鬆、某證券帮轉買爲賣、加之金號及散戶等競塞、暴跌六十匕元、錢兌業出銀號五十兩、爲五千零三十元、後金號進銀樓帮五十兩、爲五千零三十三元、作晚收價、結果比上日回跌九十七元、收後略硬、某銀號進錢兌業一十兩、高至五千零五十元、全天一百四十兀上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高數元、收進减低二十元、現　金照掛牌金低五十餘元、均鮮　開、</p>
<p>飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸五百二十元、迨至九時五十分掛低五兀、十時一刻回升五元、十一時復小五元、下午三時又低五元、結果共小十元、計大同行改懸五白十元、新同行與上價相同、收進减低十五元光景、</p>
<h3>證券　內債冉升　洋股回漲</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况繼續趨高、人心比較平靜、英國援華空氣漸濃、空頭漸有抵補、多方得此輔助力、買戶漸覺有力、市價震盪範圍雖小、而其受刺激之變動則幷未失具常態、收盤忽有謠言蘇滿接觸之說、暗中市價又高一二角、昨日上午聯和補空最多、協大需要亦湧、永康聯益亦均一致買進、昌記鴻康生大等賣出、市價堅穩、午後久豐補回聯益潤亨胡鶴記各有收買、聯和協大轉有吐出、益昌入丙出戊、市價仍稍轉高、收盤價比前續好一角半至三角、成交的六十萬元左右、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交中南銀行股五十股、價爲六十元、昨日衆，股市開盤稍軟、蓋因買方審愼、俱不願妄事提拉也但賣戶亟於了結、不得不照初開時之低盤出籠、嗣因買戶激增、浮多了結淸凈、價格轉趨上升、上午交易不鮮、下午市况、倐形活潑、成交較鉅、收盤趨勢甚穩、會德豐股由開盤時之一百零八元低價直騰至一百十六元半收盤、是價買戶猶未壓足、中國墾植股之需求亦佳、價漲至十三元四角收盤、二者同爲昨日交易中之特色、橡皮股開盤寗靜、買戶甚普遍、旋價亦有進展、收市穩定、生橡皮近已連跌數日、此無疑係由英美滙兌趨努欠定、戰事金融、受制綦嚴種種關係所致、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗市狂漲暴落　四月份期貨已做開定洋改為一百念元</h3>
<p>紗市猛進疾退、變化迅速、此因美匯時升時縮、以致人心不定也、實則連朝大漲之後、引起一部份獲利者了結、不過已近一千元關口、當然曾有一度掙扎、但現紗華南方面、稍有需要、二十支　馬三月最高峯曾達九百九十七兀、低盤爲九百七十元、四月份業已開始交易做一百餘包、價爲一千元、似以三七價、定價爲一百二十元、</p>
<p>現紗晨開聞英美匯兌縮至五分半、市塲人氣熱烈、一鬨曾至九百九十七元、詎料此價一開、買者不多、逐步而下跌至八十三五元低價、買者又形活動、又升至九百九十一元、旋聞美匯、緊轉鬆、市象陸續而下至九百七十一元、查半日成交統計二千五百七十五包、行情二十支雙馬現貨價予上日不相上下、無甚軒輊、今日有出口棉紗五十五件運香港、六十件運天津、一百件運烟台、茲將各帮口買去之額量、分列如左、本</p>
<h3>棉花廠需起色</h3>
<p>本棉交易、尙稱不弱、廠方需要漸形起色、故市態靜而堅、加之本埠存貨、日見枯薄、所以同行心思依然看高、南太倉及通州兩項送廠價已做到二百二十元、蘇北來源到通花八百九十六包、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初即因利物浦來電良好而價格堅定、後又因現貨交易轉好、及同業亦稍有交易、故市况轉堅、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲起十餘磅音、印度棉市昨日亦已轉昂、連同預測漲六羅比、埃及漲十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、終因遠期匯兌之緊縮、棉價殊屬高昂、加之海外棉市轉漲、故市上交易頗爲靜寂、廠方則始終保持沉默態度、不擬購辦原棉也、茲將昨日棉市以美匯六元三一二五折合送廠價如下、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋米轉穩　北運漸多</h3>
<p>邇來米市一路下游、茲又　度暴跌、已打破少年收盤行情、昨則初開銷塲呆而不化、浮囤散戶謀速脫、若一號西貢貢祗售四十二元、火絞四十一元四十元零五角、二號西貢三十七元七角、碎尖三十二三元、但洋行家已不肯再拋、原根客販尙尙馬是瞻、授受者無非一些回籠貨、因之籌碼較稀、市面轉呈平穩、買戶乘廉進取、客販向洋行家開出本月份、原包貨一號西貢五十一元、二號四十六元半、二號暹邏四十六元六角、小絞四十七元、計有四五百噸、因之銷塲漸轉栗落、一般店胃相繼跟進、形勢回昂、迄午市業將所跌者悉數恢復、計收盤行情、一號西貢已爲四十二元八角、二號三十八元、火絞四十二元、四十一元八角、小絞三十八元半、碎尖三十四元、糯米去路雖屬不暢、然貨主以一再甩跌、顧惜身本、不忍再貶、故結果行情未見榮辱、厚薄粳早晚稻昨無所到、塲外暗盤聞仍淸淡、行情無所變化、</p>
<p>本市前曾因國米受阻、不能運入租界、民食因之恐慌、米價飛騰、幸賴洋米、大量源源不絕而來、故近日市價已稍見回落、據聞華北方面之糧食、恐慌較本市尤甚、而僞組織又缺乏資源、故不能盡量採購洋米、民食堪虞、近由商人直接向越南購備、直接運去外、並有少數由香港轉船運往、北洋帮在滬亦採購少許、茲悉今日赴津之永生輪、除由香港載往烟津之洋米一千一百九十一包外、在滬又裝二千餘包、計運津一千一百二十一包、運烟一千一百六十六包、（祖）</p>
<h3>粉麥平定　平賣滿期後廠盤加價說</h3>
<p>粉市初疲後穩、殊鮮特色、凶連日客銷不振、內地及鄕莊去化、要屬有限、惟廠盤於平賣期滿後、將有加價三元之說、故回籠貨亦不願急於求脫、上午一度擯持、後市聞米價初跌後漲、粉市站立、聞綠砲車棧單十四元八角牛、老車牌十四元四角五分、兵船牌十四元二角、成交的計三五千包、鳳凰粉十四元、成交亦有一千包、十六日粉運天津二千包、</p>
<p>小麥交易不多、市呈平庸之局、蓋邇日銀根頗緊、客囤納胃均懈、而貨方則以成本高昂、始終扳守、結果祗開無錫麥三四車、價爲二十四元五角、市面稍見鬆落、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆銷塲未衰</h3>
<p>黃豆昨日交易、雖見减少、但爲勢未衰、若榨油廠內地車坊本街囤胃等、均有指辦、行情尙少重大變化、高豆稍升三四角、中次貨因前市提漲太足、趨勢平定、統市做開南京豆　車、二十二元至二十一元五角、揚州山豆一車、二十二元至十九元五角、蚌埠豆　車、　十五元五角、滁州豆一車、二十三元五角、丁家州豆三車、二十六元半云、</p>
<h3>海味　蝦尾續鬆</h3>
<p>蝦尾近以銷路轉滯、而底存又復充裕、其勢乃績見鬆落、刻市由中尾開二百十八元至二百三十一元、高田蝦二百五十三元、坎毫尾一百九十四元至一百九十七元、比前市跌去二十元之度、國產溫州尾售一百七十元、茲又到孟買尾新貨卅七包貨品色澤並佳、隨即售開、成盤爲二百二十二元二角、</p>

<p>施賑綠豆</p>
<p>伊古救荒之道，莫善於因地制宜，因時制宜，如賑錢、賑米、賑粥是也。吾友自豫境來，備述修武濟原飢民重困情形。渠云：刻下千里赤地，餓莩載途，幸有諸大善士，督理施賑。但窮僻之地，垂死之人，即領給粟錢，亦豈能自爲炊煮乎。而諸君日奔數十里，疊嶂之間，按戶照給，縱有才力心思，亦有听未逮也。故邇來錢粟粥並授，且除此以外，又有施賑綠豆之舉。蓋去歲吳中所產綠豆，收獲甚豐，價亦甚賤。以此施賑災民，有三利焉：因西北土地高亢，其民本多燥疾，况飢餓之軀，益易感受，得此和粥，可以利腸，其利一也。綠豆之價，照米爲輕，奚啻十之三四，若糴米百觔，綠豆可多三四十觔，以此兼賑，即可多給百人，便好多活百命，推而廣之，數月之間，即可多活千百萬命，其利二也。歷覽自來荒政條程，有歲遇奇災，粟米騰貴，菽麥之中，綠豆爲最無偏勝之弊，有兼善之功。不久天氣漸熱，此物愈爲得宜。古人之言，洵小誣也，以此相例，今豈異於古所云耶。雖此豆所出，合而計之，不敵黍麥之多，若得購數百斤移賑，浮費旣省，實惠良多，較之彼千里運糧者，其頃逆之勢，又何如耶，其利三也。總此三利，即所謂因地制宜，因時制宜也。</p>

<h3>歐戰與犯罪下）</h3>
<p>— 史弢</p>
<p>犯罪數目的減少——英國</p>
<p>黑暗中的倫敦，會發生什麽獵奇式的犯罪吧？利用了燈火管制而發生的犯罪事件，將數倍于昔吧？在未實行燈火管制的開戰之後，誰都深深地懷着這個感想，事實上現在乘着黑暗偷取婦女皮包等等事件，也時聞耳際了，爲了這個緣故，近來婦女們的皮包不再挟在　下，而用手提了。</p>
<p>據倫敦警務最高當局的談話，知道戰爭之后的犯罪　向，並沒有任何變更。犯罪的件數反有減少的趨勢。其中的大部份是小偷之類的犯罪，至於強盜案子，那是極少的。當局對於犯罪的減少，認為非常光榮，並且舉出下述幾個減少犯罪的理由：</p>
<p>一·由於軍隊動員和產業方面需要人力。</p>
<p>二·警察能力較戰前增加二倍。</p>
<p>三·國民一致團結共赴國難</p>
<p>所以當局認為對於一般的犯罪，不必因為是戰時而有講求特別取締方法的必要。當局的着眼是不在揭發犯罪而在防止社會的不安，比較費盡心機的當然是警戒通敵的間諜，對於旅行者的出國入國實施着嚴重的取締；電訊，書札，印刷品，都毫不留情地檢查着；在旅館，反對等衆任聚集之處，貼着「不要被敵人所利用；不留心的談話往往會洩漏中央的秘密」等標語，以喚起市民的注意，在汜濫着各國亡命者的英倫，對於這一方面實在有警戒的必要。</p>
<p>目今英國最令人注意的，莫若離去了父兄的監督，在避難地不就學而犯罪的少年問題，這犯罪的數目，一天天在增加，於是成了個社會教育的問題，至於一般的犯罪問題，並不因戰時而深刻化起來。</p>
<p>沒有犯罪——法國</p>
<p>法國全人口四千三百萬中，大約有六百萬男子騁馳在保護祖國的軍旗之下了，所以現在殘留在法國社會上的，祗是那些婦孺以及沒有活　能力的老年男子吧了，縱使在平時，法國的報紙上照例每月不過刊載處一二次犯罪的新聞，從戰爭開始到今日為止，半載以來，差不多找不出一件類似犯罪的犯罪行為，能夠犯罪的傢伙全被徵開赴前綫去了；但是共產主義的檢舉，却很熱鬧地實行着。本来法国人認為每月進步的秩序倒不若希望混亂的到來，一旦到了祖國危急的當兒，他們便會表現出非常的潛在力，每個人幹着每個人負責任的行為，因此，今日的法國是在十分嚴肅之中，婦女們代替了男子的職責，當然，在這非常時期自有不少不幸事件發生，但法國女性是可以忍耐的。</p>
<p>在今日的法國，從戰爭中反映出來的犯罪行為，還沒有任何痕跡可尋。</p>

<h3>命運的鑰匙</h3>

<p>世界上最痛苦的，莫不若不能把握自己的命運的人了。世界上最愚笨的，莫不若把自己的命運的鑰匙，無條件地拱手讓人的了。</p>
<p>可是在我們的週遭，却有成千成萬的人，正在放棄自己命運的主權，正在把他們命運的鑰匙拱手讓人。</p>

<p>據說，中國人死於肺癆症者，在世界各國中，要算最多的了。可是爲了無知，貧窮，苟安，恐懼，迷信等種種的原因，我們對於防癆方面，始終還不曾有重大的進展。因此，每天有不少不幸的同胞，正在無條件地把他們的生命的主權，交給病菌，等到病入膏肓的時候，病菌便把他們的命運的鑰匙，移交給死神了。到那時候要反抗，要掙扎，是已經來不及了。</p>
<p>我們既然知道肺癆的危險，就應該趕快面向現實，起來與肺癆病菌搏鬥，我們要挽回我們的命運的主權，我們要爭取我們的命運鑰匙，就應該施行防癆教育，要贊助防癆運動。</p>
<p>心理</p>
<h3>心理衛生運動</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>心理衛生跟生理衛生是同樣地重要的。生理衛生注意肉體的健康；心理衛生就注意精神的健康。嚴格地說，精神的作用遠比肉體來得複雜而不可捉摸，因而易於致病，所以心理上的衛生應當更加注意。現在一般人都忽略了這一點，這實在是一個嚴重的錯誤。心理衛生不講究，精神方面就發生缺陷，個人的思想行動就反常起來，結果人與人之間的關係不能調整，社會中的種種罪惡和困難問題就因之產生了。心理的病態倘若不加注意，任其逐漸加深，那麼最後將變成瘋狂，這真是可怕的結果。所以心理衛生運動就是一種促使人們加緊注重精神健康的運動，它的宗旨是非常光明遠大而值得稱頌的。</p>
<p>心理衛生運動的起源說起來是一個非常動人的故事。我們知道人類處置精神病人一向用的是慘無人道的不合理的方法，瘋人院的黑暗和可怕並不在監獄之下，在我國瘋人更被認為有惡鬼附身，常常受到殘酷兇暴的待遇。其實這種錯誤的方法無濟於事是顯而易見的，但真不懂，人類總是執迷不悟，千百年來讓精神病人受盡磨折，吃夠苦頭，而竟無動於中。但是解決瘋人桎梏的人道革命運動中央轟轟烈烈的發動起來了。這是在三十年前，一個美國康奈狄克州的青年大學生皮爾司（C.W.Beers），因患有精神病被送進瘋人院，度了三年的非人生活，備嘗各種痛苦，並目擊種種黑暗情形，心中受了非常深刻的刺激，出院之後，他就誓以餘生致力於改善瘋人的待遇和提倡心理衛生的工作。他起初努力向各界呼籲，並將他在瘋人院中經歷以生動的文筆著成一書，名曰「精神病復原記」（A　Mind　That　Fonnd　Itself），以資宣傳。當時被他感動的人固然不少，但社會中大多數人都加以冷酷的歧視。一九〇八年，他組織了人類有史以來第一個心理衛生運動的團體—「康奈狄克州心理衛生運動協會」，其中會員連他本人和他的父兄在內只不過十三人。翌年，經他積極推廣的結果，美國全國心理衛生協會也告成立，但參加的代表也僅十一位，其時心理衛生運動進行的艱苦情形可想而知。但是皮爾司有的是堅毅不屈的精神：篡路藍縷，慘淡經營，他的至誠終於博得更多人　同情和贊助，社會人士的態度因之漸漸開明，結果心理衛生運動不僅在全美各處風起雲湧，即在世界各國也紛紛響應。一九一八年加拿大首先成立全國的正式組織，繼之為比利時，英國，巴西，於是匈牙利，德國，日本，意大利，阿根廷，澳大利，古巴，捷克，芬蘭，印度，紐西蘭，法國，西班牙，瑞士，荷蘭，奧國，丹麥，挪威，瑞典等國也都聞風而起，我國亦於民國二十五年在首都成立了中國心理衛生協會。從此心理衛生運動總算踏上了燦爛光明的大道，全世界的人民一致醒悟過來，傾向於發展健全的心理，這裡偉大的成就都是皮爾司一人的功績，這是應當為我們所永矢勿諼的。</p>
<p>心理衛生運動的目標除應用科學方法改良精神病人的待遇外，還有四點：（一）保持心理健康；（二）防止心理疾病；（三）傳播關於心理疾病正確的知識；（四）與心理衛生有關係之各機關合作。心理衛生運動若能普通的推行於大衆，則不僅罪惡减少，社會秩序賴以安甯，即教育，婚姻，家庭，實業等各方面都將因個人的心理改進而獲得莫大的利益，所以心理衛生運動實是未來人類幸福的關鍵。</p>
<p>中國心理衛生協會自從戰事發生以來，無形中已告停頓，最近聽說本埠中外心理學家及精神病學家多人，已有上海心理衛生促進會的組織，準備積極推行心理衛生　動，並已在九江路同仁醫院設立心理衛生兒童指導診療所，由精神病專家韓芬醫師主持，聽說不久還要開辦一間真正用科學方法去治療的精神病院，這無疑是一個值得向讀者報告的好消息，希望各界予以熱切的同情和合作。</p>
<p>教育</p>
<h3>真的教育</h3>
<p>— 謀</p>
<p>我在二十四個衣衫襤褸的小朋友中，發現了「真正的教育」。這種教育，使我一面感到衷心的愉快，一面輕輕地呼一口氣：「還有希望！」</p>
<p>我是一個大學二年級生，因為是「大學生」，所以更感到教育的腐化和沒落，因為周圍的氣氛，實在污腥得使人不敢相信。</p>
<p>真是偶然的機會，兩位朋友辦一所義務夜學，我也被硬拉做教師。於是我就做了「人師」，開始教育了。真是出我意料之外，我所理想的真的教育，在這襤褸的小孩　中發現他們。睜著大大的眼睛。</p>
<p>上課時仔細地聽著我，下課時又仔細地問我。他們的問題竟常使我回答不出，然而「以學長教，以教長學」就成了我的座右銘，並且我喜悅地幫助着他們解決一切知識上的困難。這樣的教育，收效當然是很宏的。因為這是真正的教育，亦已經達到真正的教育的效率。</p>
<p>然而大都數的孤島學生呢？他們醉生夢死地糊裏糊塗地過着日子，可是我相信，「懊悔」就要臨到這般人身上的，因為他們辜負了「教育」啊。</p>
<p>對那一般受真正的教育的同學們，我替他祝福：「成功者總是你們」然而對那一般糊塗的同學呢，我只有辛酸地搖著頭，我盡我的力量，嘶呼着：「醒醒吧！抓住教育的機會吧！」</p>
<h3>希特勒的聲音</h3>
<p>— 放任</p>
<p>美國普渡大學，曾把希特勒演講時的聲音研究過。據說他的代表語句的音波顫動數，每秒鐘竟達二二八次之多，較通常人發怒時的波動率還多八次，故能使聽衆如受催眠。不過當一個人如此說話時，他的情緒勢必太過奮張，非意識所能控制。該校研究的結果，遂認為希特勒在演講時，幾近於患有「歇斯底里」（Hysteria）者。</p>
<h3>人生較高的要求　（一）</h3>
<p>我們今天所談的聖經，是講到一個年青。在人生歷程中所遭遇一種希有的經騐。掃羅的父親，打發掃羅去尋找一擊關心失落的驢子，在尋找的時候，他好像覺着一定得不着結果。不料無意中卻遇着了撒母耳，他是一位大先知，一位著名的明哲人。撒母耳呢，他關心到國家的福利，失掃羅關心失落的驢子更甚。他看掃羅雖強健，勇敢，有大才幹，正是他所要求得的好青年。他認掃羅不止王佐之才，於是膏立他為以色列之王。並對他講述國家種種緊要問題。掃羅回到家中，把所得結果，報告給他的叔父。他叔父聽說掃羅遇着大先知撒母耳，便很懇切的要求他的兒子說，「快告訴我，撒母耳對你說了什麽？」掃羅的回答倒是很有興趣，他說先知告訴我，失落的驢子找得了。」掃羅絕不提及談到國家的事。請想想看，一個青年，被膏立為王，一個著名的大哲人，指點他以治國的方針，並告訴他，一國的命運，全縏在他個人身上，他怎麼辦呢？這一切他連不提！他這樣的際遇，再重要沒有，他將做一國之王，而對他叔父所說的，確實找驢子的事。他爲什麽不提呢？有人說，當危急時候，人民情緒緊張，談話往往避重就輕，談到一般人所常談的事上去。這或者是掃羅所以不提國家的怨過。也許他叔父所說的話，知識問談，有無什麽意思，所以掃羅把自己的事秘而不宣，或至少暫時不說。又或者他要將此事加以熟思，研究所遭遇的一切，把自己關於將來命運的動機，加以分析。但是，我想衣裳各　情不是掃羅的本意。我們看他被膏立為王之後。所做的事，知道他好像對此無大興趣，或不大在意。他很明白的對自己說，「國事無定，麻煩，屬於幻想，或無一事能可實現，像這樣的事，我不能担任。頂好用我的精力去做現實有把握的事，比日夜為種種理論煩心要好些。因此，他很滿意於他目前享受的生活，歡喜去找他的驢子。為何去為國事討煩惱呢？（待續）</p>

<h3>使人大哭大笑的機器</h3>
<p>— 陸德綱</p>
<p>美國有一位物理學家，最近發明一種神秘的機器，它能播放某種特殊的電波，使人感受後，便會大哭或大笑不止，現在據說已請得專利，不久後便將把這種機器裝置在劇臺上。當演戲時，若所演是喜劇，那麽卽播放快樂的電波，觀衆的神經一觸電波後，便莫不哄堂大笑，連續數小時不休。相反若是所演是悲劇，那麽祗須播放悲哀的電波，觀客便莫不痛哭流涕，如喪考妣一般，不管劇情如何平凡，演員的技術如何拙劣，都能收得同樣的效果。</p>
<p>所以預料這機器問世後，劇塲的賈座盛况恐將不可想像，同時這機器也將使劇壇上起了一種空前的大騷動呢！</p>
<h3>閑話唱戲</h3>
<p>— 慧然</p>
<p>當我們隨便在任何京戲院裏看戲的時候往往能爲戲所感動，這因爲什麽呢？這就是因爲演員的認眞，劇情的高妙，所以使人看得起勁，而發生興趣，而最重要還得歸功於演員。</p>
<p>就唱戲的演員來說，一般人都認爲有了好嗓子就能够唱戲，這話的確不錯，要想唱戲就得要有所謂本錢，但是唱戲是不是一件容易的事呢？我認爲唱戲是最難的一件事了，因爲唱戲必定要有相當的訓練，才能够唱戲，假使有一個人他壓根沒有唱過戲，你叫他來唱，我相信他穩定不成。我們拿現在的幾個大角兒來說，他們那一個不是從小訓練出來的，就是半路唱戲出身的人，也要經過相當時候的磨練，才能上台去唱，所以要唱戲除了必須要有的好嗓外，就要有老練而好看的身段，和能吃苦耐勞的恒心。</p>
<p>比方說有一個名票，他的嗓子是很好，唱起來也很動聽，但是他的身段却很難看，那麽在他上台的時候，他只能像木頭一樣的一氣唱完，就這樣算完事了，試問這台下的看客是不是樂意的去看呢？爽性就不用粉墨登塲，而便裝獨唱好了，可是唱戲的人就不能這麽幹了。</p>
<p>寫到這裏，使我想起某年南京城內唱義務戲，有一個票友，因爲她沒有受過束腰的苦工，所以他把彩褲繫得非常的鬆，等到他上台唱他的拿手空城計時，正在唸到：「……街亭有些難保」剛一轉身，褲子就掉下來了，於是引得哄堂捧腹大笑。這也就是沒有受過訓練的關係。另外如裏頭，戴盔頭等等……，非要能吃得這些苦不可，（武生更甚），吾則即有當塲昏倒的流弊。</p>
<p>總之「唱戲」是一件絕對不容易的事，要唱戲就要吃苦，而且要顧到多方面，纔能成爲一個正式的唱戲者。</p>

<h3>一代樂聖</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>雖然本片題名爲「一代樂聖」，但整個故事的展開，「樂聖」維多赫勃祇是個陪襯的人物而已。維多起初小允露薏絲登台，及知道露薏絲將和的翰結婚，即欣然尤其所請，及最後維多訓敎辟琪，如果劇作者想寫「一代樂聖」的話，那末上述是兩塲很重要的戲，但是現在完全被曼麗瑪丁和亞倫瓊斯的戲蓋過了。所以「一代樂聖」不是寫「維多赫勃的偉續」，而是一個彷彿「桃花恨」郡樣的羅曼斯。</p>
<p>從維多赫勃誕辰席上，倒叙地展開了曼麗瑪丁與亞倫瓊斯的相逢。導演者的簡潔而生動的手法，使前半部戲非常活潑的充滿着音樂氣氛。後半部從露薏絲的聲譽壓倒了約翰以後，露薏絲的偕女兒赴瑞士隱居，希望約翰東山再起；及約翰在露薏絲公演之夕，忽然出走，又終於帮助辟琪上演，導演者也以同樣的手法來處理悲劇，就不免便半後戲軟弱下來，最後高潮的激起，也忽促而不够有力。</p>
<p>華德康諾萊的維多赫勃，風度很好，可是這裏沒有他發展演戲的機會。亞倫瓊斯和曼麗瑪丁，也以前半部的戲比後半部好。蘇珊娜馥絲的辟琪，很能演戲，是個有希望的演員。</p>
<h3>彈詞三十種</h3>
<p>— 凍雪撰文　製图</p>
<p>前奏</p>
<p>彈詞是一種比較高雅的「民間文學」。「西河詞話」稱：『以故事編爲韻語，有白有曲，可以彈唱者也。宋末有西廂傳奇，止譜詞曲，猶無演白；至金章宗時，有董解元作西廂搊彈詞，始有白有曲。』可知彈詞一道，由來已久，初非自柳敬亭而始也。</p>
<p>彈詞題材，大抵以小兒女悲歡離合的故事爲經，而以人情世故社會變態為紐，彈詞脚本中頗多出自通人筆底的善本，江南兒女，無不嗜聽，其能歷久勿衰者，蓋非偶然。</p>
<p>本篇所紀彈詞都二十種，以「左圖右史」體裁鈎繪出每一種彈詞的輪廓。　逢星期日刋登，分二十星期刋全。</p>
<p>彈詞在游藝界裏佔着相當重要的地位，本篇不敢以考據之類的文章目居，祇能說是提高一些讀者們對於這一種「民間文學」的興趣而已。</p>

<p>On the Yongwu and Yongqin roads, the Chinese army's attacks resulted in victories. A vehicle at Gaofeng'ao was struck on its side and suffered severe damage. Near Dongkuang, the Chinese destroyed several Japanese troop carriers.</p>
<p>Guilin: On the Yongwu road, the Chinese army encountered the Japanese army at Shihen Ridge on the morning of the 12th and engaged in a fierce battle. On the 13th, the Chinese army counterattacked the invading Japanese troops on the east side of Gaofeng'ao, inflicting heavy casualties. They are currently in a stalemate near the small peak of Namu. (Dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Binyang: After the Chinese army recaptured Sancha Ridge, Gaobiao Ridge, and Tonggu Ridge at noon on the 12th, they pursued the victory and advanced towards Dongkuang. The Japanese resisted stubbornly from their fortifications. After repeated assaults by the Chinese, many enemy soldiers were killed. In the evening, over a hundred Japanese vehicles, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, drove from Datang South. Near Dongkuang, many were destroyed by the Chinese, resulting in the deaths of over two hundred Japanese soldiers. On the night of the 12th, the Japanese attempted to break through to Cucun Cha Ridge, intending to relieve the siege of Dongkuang, but were defeated by the Chinese, suffering heavy losses. The Yongqin road is frequently cut off by the Chinese, and the remaining Japanese are in extreme panic. (Dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Liuzhou: After the Chinese recaptured Da Lu Ling, southeast of Lingqi, they bravely advanced towards Lingqi, making rapid progress. They have now approached Lingqi and are engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese at Gaochuang Ridge and Chaosuo Ridge (east of Lingqi). Another unit is advancing towards a certain location after clearing out the remaining Japanese at Ningjia (southwest of Bancheng). (Dispatch from the 15th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Since the Japanese suffered encirclement and annihilation by the Chinese in Shanglin and Binyang in southern Guizhou, resulting in tens of thousands of casualties, they have repeatedly resorted to spreading rumors in an attempt to confuse international public opinion. Yesterday, the Japanese side in Tokyo once again used its old tricks, falsely claiming that General Lin Wei was killed in battle in southern Guizhou. The reporter took the opportunity to discuss this with the spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission, who stated that General Lin's meticulous planning in this Guinan campaign led to a major defeat for the Japanese. To demonstrate this, he showed a personally written letter from Lin dated the 12th, proving that the Japanese rumors were completely unfounded. (Dispatch from the 15th)</p>

When enemy planes appear to be approaching or are one and a half hours away from Chongqing, one red balloon will be released. Two red balloons indicate a "preliminary warning," meaning that Japanese bombers are approaching Chongqing. Lowering both balloons indicates an "emergency warning." Raising one green balloon indicates that the alert is lifted. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from here today, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is extremely concerned about air defense facilities and relief efforts. Chiang has ordered improvements to the efficiency of medical relief, and any agencies responsible for relief work that fail to perform their duties will be subject to military law. It is also reported that a new method is being considered for air defense here. The method involves emitting ten beams of red light when Japanese planes are 400 kilometers away from Chongqing. As the Japanese planes approach Chongqing, these ten beams of red light will become twenty beams. At the same time, the first warning will be issued. When the Japanese planes are only fifteen minutes away, a final warning will be issued. At this point, the twenty beams of light will be withdrawn. When the Japanese planes return to their base, ten beams of light will be emitted again. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)</p>

<h3>冀省游擊區　生活狀况</h3>
<p>Living Conditions in the Guerrilla Areas of Hebei Province</p>
<p>Chongqing: The Secretary-General of the Hebei Provincial Kuomintang Department recently arrived here for a short trip and gave a first-hand account of the living conditions in a certain base area of the Chinese army's guerrilla forces in the Taihang Mountains of Hebei Province. It is said that General Lu Zhonglin, Chairman of Hebei Province, has now established his command headquarters in the Taihang Mountains. Life in the mountains is not as difficult as expected. Beer and cigarettes are not considered luxuries in the guerrilla areas. Chinese merchants are able to transport salt and food into the guerrilla areas despite the Japanese "economic blockade." A regular newspaper is now published in the mountains and circulated everywhere. This is no easy feat. The Chinese commanders understood the need to publish a newspaper in the area and began preparations. The biggest difficulty was the lack of a printing press. Finally, an agreement was reached with a commander of the puppet army in the area. The puppet army commander purchased a new printing press in Tianjin and transported it via the Pinghan Railway to the station closest to the Taihang Mountains, and then the guerrilla forces transported it into the mountains. The guerrilla forces and the puppet army maintain close contact. A representative of the guerrilla forces met with a puppet commander to persuade him to defect and join the guerrilla forces. The puppet commander replied that he could provide better service by staying with the Japanese, as his troops' food, clothing, weapons, and pay were provided by the Japanese. He could supply the guerrilla forces with the salt, food, and other materials they urgently needed. If the Japanese planned to attack, he could notify the guerrilla forces in advance. If the Japanese forced the puppet army to participate in combat, the puppet army could fire into the air and then retreat, abandoning weapons and ammunition to the guerrilla forces. Today, outside the cities and towns of Hebei Province, there are county magistrates appointed by the central government, while inside the city walls there are puppet county magistrates appointed by the Japanese. However, the two county magistrates often maintain close contact. For example, when a certain county magistrate appointed by the government opened a workers' training class in the occupied area, the county magistrate appointed by the Japanese sent two trusted confidants to participate in the class. The Chinese guerrilla forces have repeatedly blown up the Pinghan Railway, averaging one explosive detonation per week. Initially, if a village failed to report the presence of guerrilla forces to the Japanese, the villagers would be massacred. At the same time, the guerrilla forces also retaliated against villagers who informed the Japanese. Therefore, the villagers along the railway were in a dilemma. Finally, the villagers reached an agreement with the guerrilla forces that after each attack on the railway, they must take the responsible village chief with them and release him afterward. The Japanese are now occupying Chinese-owned coal mines in Henan Province, producing 200 tons of coal per day. The Zhongfu Company coal mine, a joint Chinese-British venture, has been destroyed by the guerrilla forces, but the Japanese have repaired the machinery in one of the coal mines and resumed operations.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Problem of Sheltering Beggars</h3>
<p>Since China has suffered foreign aggression, the number of people who have been displaced and wandering is no less than millions. Shanghai, under the protection of the concessions, has been fortunate to remain relatively intact despite the widespread disasters. As a result, like water flowing into a gully, the masses regard Shanghai as their final refuge. On the one hand, this has created the current distorted prosperity, but on the other hand, we see vagrants lingering in the streets and crouching by the roadside, all of whom are struggling on the brink of starvation. This not only affects the appearance of the city, but also has a significant impact on public order. This newspaper has repeatedly addressed this issue. Previously, it was reported that the Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council had a plan to shelter beggars, but the department's funds were restricted by the resolution of the early taxpayers' annual meeting, which stipulated that the funds collected under the land charter regulations could not be used for relief purposes. Therefore, the funds needed for the beggar relief plan had to rely on private or public donations. Although the Salvation Army is in charge of the matter, it is suffering from a lack of funds. Therefore, it is hoped that the public will take their interests into consideration and find ways to raise funds. The Municipal Council's consideration of this matter will surely be sympathized with by all sectors of the city.</p>
<p>If the source of such funds relies solely on public donations, although it is a matter of necessity, it is likely difficult to sustain. Donations come from the willingness of various parties to help, so the results are difficult to predict. However, the expenses of the undertaking are constant year after year, and cannot rely on fluctuating income to cover fixed expenditures. Moreover, Shanghai's various sectors have long been working to shelter beggars and vagrants. For example, the Xiliu Public Shelter provides shelter from wind and rain and relief from hunger and cold. The Songhu Education and Rehabilitation Institute on Liuying Road in Zhabei is dedicated to the education and rehabilitation of vagrants and beggars. Both regularly received subsidies each year, but due to the large amount of money required and the difficulty of the task, they still had to rely on donations and eventually ceased operations halfway through. In Caohejing, there is the Vagrant Work Training Center run by the Shanghai Charity Association, which has better facilities and a regular source of funds, so it is progressing in an orderly manner and has achieved considerable success. Later, it was believed that vagrants and beggars wandering the streets could not be effectively sheltered without a large-scale plan. Therefore, it was proposed to establish a vagrant factory, but the amount of money required was enormous, and it was known that it could not be achieved by public donations alone. It was proposed to relocate a certain church cemetery on North Zhejiang Road and rebuild it as a market, using this large sum of income to support regular expenses. However, due to a dispute that occurred between the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods, when the Municipal Council planned to buy this cemetery as a site for a Chinese children's public school, it was opposed by the gentry, and it was returned to the Municipal Council, but it was stipulated that it could not be used for other purposes. Therefore, this plan returned to nothing. The problem of sheltering beggars has been full of twists and turns, rising and falling repeatedly. As of now, the problem has become increasingly serious, and a solution cannot be delayed. Therefore, the Municipal Council has had to take on the burden alone.</p>
<p>However, since sheltering beggars is in the public interest, it is appropriate to hold the public responsible for the burden. Although it is said to be restricted by its powers and cannot be listed as a regular expenditure of the Municipal Council, that is, it cannot be funded by taxes, sheltering beggars and vagrants should not be regarded as relief in nature. It directly aims to improve the appearance of the city and indirectly maintain public order. Therefore, the simplest method and the most reasonable remedy is for the Municipal Council to propose to the taxpayers' meeting to allocate special funds from the municipal budget as a fee for improving the appearance of the city. This cannot be regarded as exceeding its powers. If this is not feasible, the Municipal Council could be authorized to solicit a fixed-term vagrant donation from merchants and gentry within the concession who are able to bear the tax, limited to a certain number of years. After this period, depending on the amount of revenue generated by the undertaking itself, whether it can be self-sufficient, the donation amount could be reduced or discontinued. This would provide a more fixed income and ensure the progress of the undertaking.</p>
<p>If the above-mentioned proposals cannot be realized, then with the Salvation Army's enthusiasm and perseverance, it will surely achieve considerable success. However, it can only proceed within its means and provide shelter on a limited basis. To say that it will be able to fully shelter all beggars is ultimately reminiscent of the sigh, "Where can I get tens of millions of mansions?"</p>
<h3>渝當局疏散人民　為預防日方之空襲　外使館不凖備遷移</h3>
<p>Chongqing Authorities Evacuate People to Prevent Japanese Air Raids, Foreign Embassies Not Preparing to Relocate</p>
<p>Chongqing: In light of the fact that during the Japanese air raids on the capital in May of last year, Chongqing residents suffered 5,014 deaths and injuries from Japanese bombing within two days, the Chinese government authorities are currently implementing active measures to evacuate residents in order to avoid repeating this tragedy. The authorities intend to reduce the number of residents from 500,000 to 80,000. According to responsible authorities, the number of Chongqing residents will be reduced to 250,000 by the end of May. The government hopes to further reduce the number to 100,000 or 80,000. In November of last year, the population of Chongqing reached 600,000, but by the beginning of February of this year, it had been reduced to 550,000. In early March, the military and police authorities used persuasion and coercion to evacuate another 100,000 residents. The authorities now plan to evacuate another 200,000 residents within two weeks. If so, by the end of March, only 250,000 residents will remain in Chongqing. The seven foreign embassies stationed in Chongqing have notified the government that they do not intend to relocate their offices and residences. Four foreign ambassadors (British, American, French, and Soviet) are currently here. In addition, there are 40 foreign missionaries from all over the world staying in Chongqing, preparing to provide assistance and relief work in the event of a bombing of Chongqing. The Chongqing authorities have already allowed foreign missionaries to stay in the city. Currently, most of the housewives from middle-class families in Chongqing have evacuated from Chongqing, but their husbands remain in the city. Some wealthy families have moved to western Sichuan, while others have decided to move to Hanoi, Hong Kong, Manila, and other places. The "Dagongbao" recently reported that some Chinese missionaries have moved their families to the United States. Over the past twelve months, the authorities have built tunnel-style air raid shelters throughout the foothills of Chongqing, which can accommodate 250,000 residents. However, in order to reduce the death rate of residents during the summer air raids, only half of the people are allowed to stay in Chongqing. It is reported that all members of the National Relief Commission, as well as 2,000 police officers, and 1,000 doctors and nurses, are stationed in emergency hospitals and emergency stations, preparing to provide relief to injured residents in the event of a Japanese air raid on Chongqing. Since March 1st, all emergency teams, including many monks, have been engaged in rescue work at all times. The central points for residents evacuating from Chongqing are mostly the villages near Chongqing, which include six hot springs. When women and children evacuate to these places, it is like "going on a vacation." Small department stores, photography shops, grocery stores, and silk shops are set up near these villages to meet the needs of the residents. It is said that Chongqing's merchants and shop owners are in the vanguard of those voluntarily evacuating, because they are eager to open "branch stores" in the evacuation areas and avoid the sluggishness of the "abandoned capital." New theaters, singers, and teahouses are springing up like mushrooms after rain outside "Greater Chongqing." Imported goods can only be purchased in the villages, because no merchants want to keep valuable goods in the urban commercial area for fear of being bombed. Although the Chinese authorities have made various preparations to avoid Japanese air raids on Chongqing, foreign observers here believe that if Japanese planes attack Chongqing again this year, it will not be as fierce as last year. Last year's Japanese air raids achieved nothing in military terms. Japanese planes bombing Chongqing again will only waste expensive gasoline and bombs. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<h3>奇俊峯　謁蔣委員長　內蒙女英雄　抗戰著聲聞</h3>
<p>Qi Junfeng Visits Chairman Chiang, Inner Mongolian Heroine Known for Resisting Japan</p>
<p>Chongqing: Ms. Qi Junfeng, an anti-Japanese hero from a certain banner in Inner Mongolia, arrived in Yulin, northern Shaanxi, yesterday to pay her respects to General Chiang Kai-shek here. Ms. Qi is the first female hero in Mongolian history to lead troops in the fight against Japan. Ms. Qi married a 41-year-old Mongolian prince at the age of twenty. After two years of marriage, she became a widow like Wenjun. Afterwards, she rejected many marriage proposals. She currently plans to choose a worthy partner. In 1937, Ms. Qi was captured by Japanese soldiers and imprisoned in her palace. A year later, she escaped and joined the Mongolian army supporting the National Government. Later, she became the commander of the Mongolian garrison, which was unprecedented in Mongolian history. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<h3>華利用駱駝　載運貨物</h3>
<p>China Uses Camels to Transport Goods</p>
<p>Chongqing: Most experts here believe that after two and a half years of war, China's most reliable and economical method of transportation between the interior and the outside world is still the old method of hundreds of years ago. In view of the fact that the coast has been blockaded by the Japanese navy, railways and highways are often bombed, gasoline is difficult to obtain, and there are various problems related to railway maintenance and truck operation, the Chinese are now using camels in the northwest to transport goods to and from the Soviet Union, and using sailing ships to navigate inland waterways. The ancient roads of centuries ago, which had been abandoned after the construction of railways and highways, are now being traversed by horse-drawn carriages full of goods. The Chinese authorities have now reopened the ancient post roads of Yunnan and Guizhou, which were once used by merchants and travelers. Soon, horse-drawn carriages carrying goods will appear on these long-abandoned roads, importing the supplies needed by China and exporting Chinese products. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<h3>美國人士觀察　日蘇衝突遲早難免　傳諾蒙亨附近又啓釁端　日軍部發言人聲明否認</h3>
<p>American Observers Believe that Conflict Between Japan and the Soviet Union is Inevitable Sooner or Later, It is Reported that Hostilities Have Resumed Near Nomonghan, Spokesman for the Japanese Military Denies</p>
<p>Washington: According to observers here, after the end of the Soviet-Finnish War, the Soviet and Japanese armies will inevitably have intermittent conflicts again in the Manchurian border area. However, this conflict may not develop into a large-scale war, as the Soviet Union's position in the Balkans is not yet clear. However, if the Soviet Union's position in the Balkans becomes clear, it is not impossible that the Soviet Union will take an offensive against Japan. According to the Soviet side, the Soviet Union's attack on Finland this time was aimed at protecting Leningrad, but this reason also applies to the Far East. In other words, if the Soviet Union protects the safety of Vladivostok, it can also launch a full-scale offensive against the Manchurian border. As for future small conflicts, they can greatly restrain the Japanese army's actions in China. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: According to unconfirmed reports, Soviet and Japanese troops have clashed again near Nomonghan. Soviet troops have reportedly penetrated five miles into "Manchukuo" and are continuing to advance. (Havas dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Japanese Army Ministry strongly denied today the reports from Shanghai that Soviet and Japanese troops had fought in the Nomonghan area. The spokesman dismissed the report as "baseless" and denied that any contact had occurred recently at any point on the "Manchukuo" border. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<h3>傳天津白銀問題　英日商有成議　轉移須得中政府同意一點　據聞仍為東京談判之障礙</h3>
<p>It is Reported that British and Japanese Merchants Have Reached an Agreement on the Tianjin Silver Issue, the Requirement of Obtaining the Chinese Government's Consent for Transfer is Still Reportedly an Obstacle to the Tokyo Negotiations</p>
<p>Tokyo: British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki for an hour this morning. According to the "Asahi Shimbun," the Tianjin silver issue was the subject of discussion, but the obstacle still lies in the British government's insistence on obtaining the Chinese government's consent for the transfer of silver. The "Yomiuri Shimbun" also reported that it is said that Craigie and Tani Masayuki will sign a memorandum at their next meeting, formally indicating a resolution to the silver issue. Regarding this matter, both sides reached a complete agreement on the following basis on the 4th of this month: (1) The silver currently in the cellar of the British Consulate in Tianjin will be sealed and not moved. (2) The safekeeping of the silver will be jointly managed by the British and Japanese. (3) If necessary, a committee organized by British, American, and Japanese people will decide on the allocation of this silver. (4) Part of the silver, worth 100,000 British pounds, will be given to the Japanese to purchase food from Australia and Canada to relieve refugees in North China. The newspaper also said that with the resolution of the silver issue, the Japanese will lift the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. According to Reuters, the British ambassador's meeting with Tani Masayuki today was to discuss minor matters and did not mention the silver issue, as there are still some differences of opinion between the two sides, and the Japanese newspapers are being overly optimistic. (Reuters dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to news from here today, the British and Japanese have in fact reached an agreement on the issue of Chinese silver in the British Concession in Tianjin. The joint method is that the silver will be jointly managed by the Japanese, and another 100,000 British pounds will be provided to relieve refugees in North China. The detailed content of the agreement will probably be announced by the Wang Jingwei organization or the new government. It is also said that after the silver issue in the British Concession is resolved, the Japanese will further control the Chinese silver in the French Concession.

<h3>法日商約　昨日滿期　新約無續訂可能</h3>
<p>The Franco-Japanese Commercial Treaty Expired Yesterday, Renewal of a New Treaty is Unlikely</p>
<p>Tokyo: According to a Foreign Ministry spokesman today, the Franco-Japanese provisional trade agreement expired today, and negotiations for renewal have not been conducted. Only the basic treaty of commerce and navigation of 1911 remains in effect. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to political observers here today, Franco-Japanese relations are now trending towards deterioration. The Franco-Japanese commercial treaty that expired today is unlikely to be renewed. The reason for the Franco-Japanese estrangement is the bombing of French property in South China by Japanese aircraft, but such actions by the Japanese will continue to occur in the future. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<h3>張嘉森論　中蘇合作</h3>
<p>Zhang Jiasen on Sino-Soviet Cooperation</p>
<p>Chongqing: Zhang Jiasen, leader of the Chinese National Socialist Party, published an article in the Dagongbao today, advocating close cooperation between China and the Soviet Union for the mutual benefit of both countries. China and the Soviet Union share a border of thousands of miles. Neither China nor the Soviet Union is capable of building a Maginot Line on such a long border. Not only are China and the Soviet Union incapable of undertaking such a great project, but the economic strength and scientific technology of the 20th century are also insufficient to accomplish this. Therefore, it is necessary for China and the Soviet Union to cooperate closely. Furthermore, a strong China is sufficient to prevent imperialists from uniting in an anti-Soviet movement. At the same time, a strong Soviet Union is sufficient to protect China's freedom and prevent it from being invaded by foreign forces. Therefore, the security and prosperity of Asia depend entirely on the cooperation between China and the Soviet Union. We hope that the conclusion of the Soviet-Finnish peace will further increase aid to China and support China's constitutional movement. (Associated Press dispatch from the 15th)</p>
<h3>Nanjing to Hold "Political Conference"</h3>
<p>Peiping: According to Chinese sources, the "Central Political Conference" to be held in Nanjing is planning to establish a new regime. In addition to discussing the procedures for convening a "National Assembly," the following points will be proposed: (1) the establishment of the central government and the selection and number of personnel for the five Yuan and various ministries; (2) the power of the central government; (3) the date of implementing the constitution; (4) the outline of domestic and foreign policies; (5) the re-adjustment of foreign policy; (6) the promulgation of a declaration to all countries in the world. The conference site will be at the original site of the Examination Yuan in front of Jiming Temple. Currently, 400 workers are engaged in renovation. It is reported that the conference preparatory committee, for security reasons, has requested the assistance of the Japanese authorities in defense. The area around the site will be guarded by a special guard line, and no idlers will be allowed to pass. When the new regime is established, the Joint Committee will no longer be needed. Therefore, the committee has decided to hold a dissolution meeting after the end of the Nanjing Central Political Conference. Wang Kemin and others will be among the North China representatives attending the Central Political Conference. (Reuter, 15th)</p>

<h3>After the End of the War, Soviet and Finnish Troops Began to Retreat. The Hanko Peninsula Was Ceded Within a Week. It is Rumored that Kuusinen Will Be Appointed as Governor.</h3>
<p>Helsinki: The Finnish delegation to the peace talks has returned here from Moscow via the capital of Sweden. All newspapers have published the contents of the peace treaty and the new boundary line between the two countries. The troops of both sides are scheduled to begin withdrawing from the 15th of this month and complete the withdrawal by the 25th. However, the Petsamo region in northern Finland will not be completely withdrawn until April 10. The Hanko Peninsula must be ceded to the Soviet Union before the 23rd of this month. A wireless telegram has been issued here prohibiting people from traveling to the ceded areas of the Soviet Union. All local residents, a total of 250,000 people, must move elsewhere. The Ministry of Military Affairs has also issued an order requisitioning all means of transportation to carry these people and their assets, but people are not allowed to transport them privately. According to Finland, among the cities to be ceded to the Soviet Union in the Karelian Isthmus, the most important are three: one is the port of Vyborg, with a population of 80,000; one is the city of Käkisalmi, with a population of 6,000; and one is the city of Antrea, with a population of 5,000. According to observers, 5,000 Red Army corpses were left on the north side of Lake Ladoga, and they are now submerged in ice and snow. Once the ice and snow melt, they will be exposed and rot, which is greatly detrimental to public health. In addition, the Karelian Isthmus has many Finnish industrial centers, the most important of which are the lumber and celluloid factories in Pikkarala. The port of Vyborg is an important port for Finland's timber exports. After it is ceded to the Soviet Union, Finland's timber will be exported only through the port of Kotka in the east. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>London: Last night, the Soviet broadcast from this radio station stated that the Soviet troops who entered Vyborg on Wednesday held a celebration meeting for "Peace and Victory." The broadcast stated that the Finnish army "is now quiet and peaceful." In addition, the Soviet army held other gatherings. The speeches at the meeting expressed condolences for the Soviet government's "obtaining the security of Leningrad" and attacked "those in England and France who instigated the war." It said, "We have shattered their plans, and they now understand the consequences if they dare to try again." (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to news from northern Finland, the Soviet army has begun to withdraw. The Finnish army and volunteers stationed in the area are still defending their original positions awaiting orders. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The "Social Democratic Newspaper" here recently published a telegram from a reporter stationed in Helsinki, stating that after Finland ceded the Karelian Isthmus to the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will appoint Otto Wille Kuusinen, chairman of the "Finnish People's Government," as the governor to rule it. Kuusinen is the leader of the Finnish Communist Party and has been in exile in the Soviet Union for many years. After the outbreak of the Finnish-Soviet war last year, he organized the so-called "People's Government" under the auspices of the Soviet Union. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Finland, Norway and Sweden Initially Discussed a Three-Nation Defense Alliance, Intended to Protect the Borders and Independence of the Three Countries. Finland Expressed Its Unwillingness to Be Suspected of Being Anti-Soviet.</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Last night, it was announced here that the governments of Finland, Sweden, and Norway have now agreed to study the nature of the possibility of a three-nation defense alliance in order to protect the borders and independence of the three countries. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>Moscow: People here believe that the Soviet government does not oppose the conclusion of a purely defensive alliance between Sweden, Norway, and Finland, but any group action specifically against the Soviet Union will be regarded by the Soviet Union as a violation of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Speaker of the House Väinö Hakkila recently delivered a speech, which in essence stated, "Any action that is suspected of being against the Soviet Union is in conflict with the peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union." Observers, upon hearing this, generally stated that at a time when Finland is planning to conclude a defense alliance treaty with Sweden and Norway, this speech is particularly noteworthy. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler met with reporters yesterday and said that a few days before the Soviet-Finnish peace talks, the Finnish government sent a telegram to the governments of Norway and Sweden, proposing to conclude a three-nation defense alliance. Upon receiving the replies from the two countries, they said that they would consider the possibility of this alliance after peace was restored. These negotiations are currently underway, and the rumor that it has already been signed is an exaggeration. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: The date of the three-nation conference of Sweden, Norway, and Finland on a defense alliance may be announced soon. It is expected that the conference site will not be held outside the capitals of the three countries, with Oslo being the most likely. At the same time, Norway and Sweden are currently focusing on the development of defense. It is reported that Sweden is now supplementing its delegation's purchase of fighter jets in the United States. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Although the governments of Norway and Sweden are still studying the defense alliance plan proposed by Finland, the defenses of Scandinavia are being accelerated in all aspects. Generally, people feel that one thing is currently more important than the Finnish territory bordering a dangerous situation, that is, whether Finland or Norway and Sweden will be forced to join the overall issue of the Soviet-German group is already in a precarious situation. At the same time, opinions on the need for a defense alliance also differ among the Scandinavian countries. According to Norwegian sources, Oslo believes that any defense agreement will not help the overall situation and will be rejected. Sweden is more welcome to this concept. According to today's Nya Dagligt Allehanda, it is crucial for Norway, Sweden, and Finland to conclude this alliance. The newspaper also expressed regret that Denmark, due to its lack of resources and close ties to Germany, could not apply to join this alliance. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Finland, Sweden, and Norway are currently conducting talks through diplomatic channels to discuss and agree on a defense alliance treaty and are determined to conclude it. Even the Soviet Union has issued a hint, stating that it does not conflict with the mutual non-aggression clauses in the Finnish-Soviet peace treaty. For this reason, those responsible here generally say that there should be no major obstacles to the future of the Northern European three-nation defense alliance treaty. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>Finnish ceded area, residents evacuated</h3>
<p>Stockholm: The evacuation of residents from the ceded areas of Finland is now being carried out according to the plan drawn up when the situation was serious last autumn. The residents of the same village will be gathered together first and then moved to another village. All railways will be mobilized for the evacuation, and those who hold driver's licenses will be summoned to assist in this work. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The majority of the residents of the Karelian Isthmus and some other places, which will be ceded to the Soviet Union, are farmers and landlords, 99% of whom will move elsewhere within a few days. According to the government's plan, the residents of the Karelian Isthmus must move to central Finland, and those living along Lake Ladoga will move to the coastal area of Åbo in western Finland. The authorities in various parts of central Finland have already begun to requisition means of transportation, trucks, and cars to carry these people and their assets. In addition, this city has been bombed by Soviet planes many times since the start of the war, and the scene is desolate, but from today onwards, the black cloth hanging on the windows of each house has been removed, and the obstacles in each store have also been removed. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: Helsinki canceled the blackout last night, restoring normality for the first time in three and a half months. The lights were bright and the people were happy. Although it snowed heavily during the day, there were still many people walking on the streets at night. Except for the piles of sandbags, everything in Helsinki can be said to have returned to normal. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<h3>The entire Soviet Union celebrates victory</h3>
<p>Moscow: After the peace between Finland and the Soviet Union, the radio station here recently issued a message stating that the entire Soviet Union is celebrating the "victory of the Red Army." Factories and public places are also holding gatherings to celebrate the "Red Army's breakthrough of the Mannerheim Line" and that the Soviet government's "peace policy" has finally eliminated the railway line between Leningrad and Murmansk, gaining security. This policy, which wanted to establish anti-Soviet military bases within Finland, has failed. In short, "Peace has now triumphed, and the rights of small countries have also been secured." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Norwegian Foreign Minister's statement on maintaining neutrality explains the reasons for rejecting Britain and France's passage.</h3>
<p>Oslo: Foreign Minister Koht delivered a broadcast speech at 9:30 tonight, stating that we were deeply saddened upon hearing the contents of the peace treaty between Finland and the Soviet Union. The reason is that our country and Sweden aided Finland and sent volunteers to help in the war, ahead of other countries. "Finland's long-term resistance was a real situation, but it was not easy to fight hard until now. Last month, the Finnish government asked Sweden for help, but did not make the same request to our country. Our immediate priority is to maintain neutrality and stay out of the war, because if our country participates in the Finnish-Soviet war, there is a risk of being drawn into the whirlpool of the Western European war, which is terrible. Moreover, even if our troops went to Finland to help in the war, it might not be able to turn the tide. Even with regard to the request made by Britain and France on the 2nd of this month for "our country to allow the regular troops of each country to pass through," we waited for Sweden's reply before giving a negative reply on the 4th of this month for reference. In our opinion, "If you want to help Finland, you must have 100,000 troops, but if Britain and France send troops to help, Germany will also send troops to intervene." After weighing the pros and cons, we had to reject it. Some parties have repeatedly criticized our country for failing to be completely neutral. "For example, in the case of the German ship "Altmark," Britain and France accused our country of violating neutrality, while Germany did not criticize it, which shows that it is really difficult for us to be comprehensive. As for the rumor that Germany has built submarine bases on our coast and that our country has secretly supplied Germany with various goods, these are not true. If this statement were true, it would prove that the effective blockade policy of Britain and France is completely ineffective. In the past six months, our country's iron ore exports to Germany have been only 640,000 tons, which is a significant decrease compared to the 2,250,000 tons in the six months before the war. In short, "Our country will do everything possible to defend its neutrality and peace. In this period of peace, our country is also willing to help Finland engage in reconstruction work." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Finland once asked Britain and France to send troops to help in the war. British, French and Polish troops were ready to be dispatched.</h3>
<p>London: A Reuter's parliamentary correspondent learned that Finland initially requested assistance from the Allies for war equipment rather than manpower. The Allies tried their best to transport war equipment to Finland as far as possible. Before long, Finland made an informal request for 50,000 soldiers to help in the war in May. The difficulty for the Allies to fulfill this request was that Sweden and Norway did not allow troops to pass through their territory. Although the Allies were still making preparations, they were ready to send the troops to Finland immediately upon receiving Finland's appeal. According to Reuter's information, if the expeditionary force were to depart, it would have full equipment, including an air force squadron. (Reuter, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Britain and France supplied Finland with a large amount of munitions, part of which had already been transported to the Scandinavian Peninsula when the Soviet Union and Finland signed a peace treaty. Britain and France will now transport it back. Although the governments concerned have provided political facilitation in this regard, the procedures are still extremely complicated and will not be completed until a few days later. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Paris: The Polish News Agency here recently announced that the Polish Expeditionary Force, including naval, land, and air forces, was fully prepared and waiting in France to join the British and French forces to go to Finland. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<h3>The peace treaty passed the second reading in the Finnish Parliament and may be approved within a few days.</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Finnish Foreign Minister Tanner told reporters here yesterday that the Finnish Parliament may approve the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty within a few days. Before the treaty is approved, the conditions will be "discussed in detail." After the treaty is approved, Finland will send a new delegation to Moscow to exchange ratification documents. According to reliable sources, the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty has already passed the first and second readings. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Armistice Promotes Soviet-Italian Relations Soviet-Italian Trade Agreement Negotiations</h3>
<p>Berlin: According to German reports, the end of the Soviet-Finnish war is sufficient to promote the rapprochement between the Soviet Union and Italy. The two countries will restore diplomatic relations and establish a commercial treaty. In addition, the commercial talks between Berlin and Rome and Moscow and Rome will improve Germany's difficulties after being blockaded by Britain. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's recent trip to Rome was to discuss this matter. After the German Foreign Minister returned to Berlin from Rome, he went straight to see Hitler. Officials denied rumors that Germany, the Soviet Union, and Romania would establish a three-nation non-aggression treaty. Romanian sources here also said that this matter has no basis. (Associated Press, 15th)</p>
<p>Rome: Foreign countries are paying close attention to the development of Soviet-Italian relations, but Italian newspapers do not mention the Italian official attitude. Agence France-Presse anticipates that the Italian ambassador to the Soviet Union will return to his post in Moscow, and Soviet-Italian commercial negotiations will also begin. However, well-informed sources believe that the recall of the Italian ambassador to the Soviet Union was due to the Soviet ambassador to Italy returning to Moscow without presenting his credentials. Therefore, the return of the Soviet ambassador depends on the return of the Soviet ambassador and the presentation of credentials to the Italian head of state. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<h3>It is rumored that the Soviet Union and Romania are conducting negotiations</h3>
<p>London: New York Radio relayed a message from Berlin stating that Germany had obtained a guarantee from the Soviet Union that no matter what happens in Southern Europe, it would never invade Romania. Negotiations on a Soviet-Romanian treaty are currently underway. A Romanian general is now in Berlin. Although it is rumored that his visit to Berlin is only for technical talks, this trip is of great significance. Berlin also stated that the negotiations between the Soviet Union and Romania will change the international situation before the end of this week. According to Reuter's investigation, well-informed sources in London have not obtained information confirming the above news. (Reuter, 15th)</p>
<p>London: According to Berlin news, the Soviet Union and Romania will re-sign a non-aggression treaty (the Soviet Union previously signed a multilateral non-aggression pact with a certain country on July 3, 1933, which also included Romania). British officials and Romanian officials have not confirmed this statement. Romanian sources in London said that a decision on this matter must first be made after consulting other countries in the Balkan Pact, especially Turkey. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<h3>After the Soviet-Finnish armistice, the European situation as observed by Norwegian newspapers</h3>
<p>Oslo: The Norwegian semi-official newspaper "Aftenposten" published an article yesterday commenting on the impact of the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty on the overall European situation, stating that after the restoration of peace between the Soviet Union and Finland, Germany and Finland will definitely adjust their relations through the mediation of Soviet Russia, which will also have a significant impact on Sweden. In recent months, Sweden and Germany have had proposals and preparations for establishing good relations, and this tendency may become a reality due to the armistice in Northern Europe. The newspaper continued that Italy will definitely try its best to strengthen relations with Germany and the Soviet Union in the future, and Turkey will inevitably be divided on Britain and France. As a result, the European situation will change greatly, and the position of Britain and France will inevitably become unfavorable. (Haitong, 15th)</p>
<h3>French Senate discusses the Finnish question</h3>
<p>Paris: The Senate held a closed meeting this afternoon. Many senators successively raised questions about the government's policies on the Finnish question. Former Prime Minister Laval also raised questions about wartime foreign policy. The Senate will continue to meet tomorrow afternoon to listen to the report of Prime Minister Daladier and then vote. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>The Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union will open on the 29th</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently decided to convene the Sixth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union in Moscow on the 29th of this month. (Tass, 15th)</p>
<h3>United States expands air force budget</h3>
<p>Rome: Air Force Colonel Valle declared today during the Fascist Trade Union Council's debate on the air force budget that the current production rate of Italian military aircraft is higher than at any time in the past, and will almost double in the next few months. Colonel Valle continued that the German Air Force has clearly demonstrated its superiority over British merchant shipping in the North Sea. As for dealing with warships, although it cannot have any effect, it can at least limit its use and activities. This situation is particularly important in Italy, because the Mediterranean is our channel and life, and we must rely on airplanes to maintain its opening. Mussolini was also present at the meeting at the time, and then, in his capacity as Minister of the Army, proposed a bill stipulating that the maximum amount of increased defense expenditure up to June 30 of this year is 8 billion lire (approximately £108,000,000).

<h3>The Dutch Ambassador to China will be replaced</h3>
<p>The Hague: After the Dutch Ambassador to China, F.C.A. den Beer Poortugael, returned to his country, he has not yet returned to his post. Political sources recently stated that the government will promote Count Bylandt, Chargé d'Affaires in Egypt, to the post of Dutch Ambassador to China. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>Paris – The Polish government today released a white paper, including 184 diplomatic documents, to explain "the reasons for the country's resistance to aggression and its determination to continue the war." The Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Grarinski, also gave a statement to the press. The documents contained in this white paper are not limited to the relationship between Poland and Germany but also involve the relationship between Poland and the Soviet Union, covering the period from 1933 to 1939. It is divided into two parts:</p>
<p>(A) Part One: The evolution of diplomatic relations between Germany and Poland, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) On May 2, 1933, the Polish Ambassador to Germany, Mr. Wysocki, held talks with the German leader Hitler to discuss promoting bilateral relations. This was the starting point of Poland's efforts to improve relations with Germany and avoid the use of force to resolve bilateral issues. The two sides then concluded a non-aggression pact on January 26, 1934, to reaffirm friendship. (2) Germany repeatedly proposed a joint attack on the Soviet Union with Poland. The first time was on February 10, 1935, when the German Minister of Aviation, General Göring, proposed this to the late Polish Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski. The second time was on August 14, 1936, when the current German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a speech, emphasizing that the crisis posed by the Soviet Union was an important factor in promoting German-Polish relations. However, the Polish government never agreed to this proposal. It can be seen that the reason why Germany's plan to attack the Soviet Union failed to materialize was due to Poland's opposition. (3) From 1923 to 1938, the German authorities constantly declared their respect for the existing Polish territory. The German Minister of Aviation, General Göring, even declared on February 16, 1937, "The Polish Corridor is not a must-have for our country. I hereby solemnly declare that we have no intention of taking the Corridor." Even the German leader Hitler also issued a declaration on May 2, 1933, stating that "Germany recognizes that all current treaties are binding." As for Poland, it never attempted to expand its rights in the Free City of Danzig. Hitler himself admitted this during a conversation with the Polish ambassador on November 5, 1937. (4) Since 1938, Germany's ambitions towards Poland have gradually been exposed. The German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop held talks with the Polish Ambassador Lipski on October 24, 1938, strongly stating that Germany wanted to incorporate the Free City of Danzig into its territory and build a highway through the Polish Corridor. This was the first. Hitler confirmed this request again when he received the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Beck, on January 5, 1939. This was the second. In March of the same year, Germany occupied the Czech provinces of Moravia and Bohemia, and its propaganda machine vigorously carried out anti-Polish movements. This was the third. In response, the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Beck, ordered the Polish Ambassador to Germany, Lipski, on October 31, 1938, to inform the German authorities that any action attempting to incorporate the Free City of Danzig into German territory could lead to conflict. However, the Polish government was still prepared to discuss this specific proposal, especially the proposal concerning transportation between Germany's East Prussia and mainland Germany. However, the German government has not yet put forward a counter-proposal. The Polish government was forced to sign a mutual guarantee agreement with the United Kingdom on April 6, 1939, and reaffirmed the alliance treaty between Poland and France on April 13 of the same month. (5) In the five months from April to August 1939, Germany consistently avoided negotiations with the Polish government. Towards the end of August, the Danzig Free City Council arbitrarily changed its constitution, and the leader of the Nazi Party in the city, Forster, arbitrarily declared himself the leader of Danzig. Until the evening of August 31, German radio suddenly broadcast the so-called final demands, but in reality, these demands were not formally presented. Thus, without waiting for the Polish government to discuss them, the war had already broken out. Whose responsibility this is, is very clear.</p>
<p>(B) Part Two: Includes the international treaties on which the diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union were based, and explains their evolution as follows:</p>
<p>(1) After Germany and Poland concluded a non-aggression pact on January 26, 1934, the Polish Foreign Minister, Colonel Beck, went to Moscow for an official visit. In addition to issuing formal speeches reaffirming friendship, the authorities of the two countries also signed a protocol to extend the period of validity of the non-aggression treaty between Poland and the Soviet Union. (2) The Polish government has refused any proposal to join the anti-Comintern pact. The Soviet government, on the other hand, had always been hostile to Germany before September 1939. The Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union, Mr. Potemkin, declared in Warsaw last May that "If an armed conflict occurs between Germany and Poland, the Soviet Union will adopt a benevolent neutral attitude towards Poland," which is clear evidence. Unexpectedly, a few months later, the country's policy suddenly changed, and the Red Army troops finally entered Polish territory on September 19 of last year, it is said. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>Anniversary of the Fall of Czechoslovakia: British Foreign Secretary Encourages Czechs, Resolves to Help Czechs Fight for National Restoration</h3>
<p>London – Tonight is the eve of the first anniversary of the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. Foreign Secretary Halifax wrote an article to encourage the Czechs not to be discouraged. The original article was written in Czech and broadcast by radio. The content roughly stated that Hitler originally provided assurances that he would respect the integrity of Czechoslovakia, but he went back on his word and brazenly turned Czechoslovakia into a protectorate, sending troops to station in Prague. "The promises he and the German government made have been rendered untrustworthy due to this violent and perfidious behavior. The horrific actions taken by the country afterward were even more brutal, such as the forced closure of Czech schools and the arrest of intellectual leaders, which have aroused the indignation of the world. Germany's intention is to destroy the Czech people's economic and spiritual life in one fell swoop. Fortunately, the Czech people, though in distress, are still united and determined to fight for freedom with great courage. Germany's attempt has ultimately failed. The British people, while admiring the Czech people, express their sympathy. Now, the government and people of the British Empire have joined forces with the Allied countries to fight shoulder to shoulder, determined to restore freedom to the Czech people and relieve their suffering, to correct the unjust situation and transform Europe, so that such crimes will never be repeated. This is the supreme goal for which we are fighting, and we wish to encourage the Czech people together," it is said. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Berlin – German leader Hitler telegraphed a reply to Neurath, Protector of Poland, stating, "I deeply appreciate your telegram of congratulations on the anniversary of the establishment of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The two regions of Bohemia and Moravia have belonged to the German Empire for a thousand years. The Germans and Czechs in the new Germany will be able to trust each other and cooperate permanently." (Haitong dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>Germany Arrests More People in the Protectorate</h3>
<p>Paris – According to reports from the Czech border, the authorities in Bohemia and Moravia have recently arrested a large number of people again, similar to the situation before Germany invaded Poland. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<h3>US Peace Envoy Welles Revisits Rome, British Authorities Explain Their Views, Europe Needs Security Guarantees</h3>
<p>Paris – US Undersecretary of State Welles took a train from here to Rome at 8:29 this afternoon. Deputy Foreign Minister Turi, Italian Ambassador Gallageria, British Ambassador Campbell, and US Chargé d'Affaires Murray were at the station to see him off. As for President Roosevelt's personal letter, it has been presented to Premier Daladier by Undersecretary Welles in person. The content is kept strictly secret and will not be released. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Rome – Informed sources claimed last night that US Undersecretary of State Welles' second visit to Rome is more important than the first. It is widely believed that Welles may meet with the Pope again before returning to the United States. (United Press dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>London – Reuters has learned that US Undersecretary of State Welles had the following impressions when he left Britain yesterday: (1) Europe needs security guarantees, which is the main factor in the international situation. (2) Britain and France are determined to fight to the end to obtain this guarantee. (3) Britain and France are not prepared to allow economic or other issues to lead to a temporary peace. The Allies were also very impressed by Welles' clear attitude in expressing the United States' eternal concern for the current and future situation in Europe. They were also satisfied that Welles apparently grasped the true situation in each country. The Allies felt no fear in comparing their views with those of President Roosevelt, as presented by Welles.

<h3>Soviet Izvestia Comments on the Significance of the Peace Treaty, Not Limited to Truce</h3>
<p>Moscow – Regarding the Soviet-Finnish peace treaty, Izvestia commented, "The significance of this treaty is not limited to a truce. This treaty has destroyed the base of operations for anti-Soviet war (which was prepared by the enemies of the Soviet Union outside the city of Leningrad for decades). At the same time, this treaty has also strengthened the security of the entire Gulf of Finland coast and the Murmansk Railway (which is the artery of our north and Murmansk). The security was achieved through a reasonable and fair demarcation. Not only that, this treaty has also laid a solid foundation for various friendly relations between the two countries. The treaty stipulates that Soviet goods can be transported to Norway via Petsamo, and the Soviet Union and Finland will jointly build a new railway to develop Soviet and Swedish freight transportation. All of these have also laid a stable foundation for Soviet-Finnish economic cooperation and are in line with the treaty's purpose of restoring economic relations and starting negotiations on trade agreements. Whether in letter or spirit, the treaty does not destroy Finland's independence (which Finland gained from the Soviet Union 22 years ago). The Soviet Union did not want to see the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish war. On the contrary, the Soviet Union has done its best to avoid war. However, the forces that launched the new imperialist war in Europe and attempted to expand the war incited Finland to fight against its friendly neighbors. In the atmosphere of the expanding European war, the Soviet Union continues its large-scale peace efforts. The proposals given by the Soviet Union to Finland in October 1939 were part of these efforts. At the same time, in view of the tense air, the Soviet Union is also striving to obtain security for its borders and establish friendly relations with its closest neighbors, because in the air containing poisonous substances, these neighbors are very likely to be used by imperialists. The good achievements of the Soviet Union's peace policy are well known. The agreements concluded by the Soviet Union with Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania are clear evidence. These agreements not only guarantee the permanent peace between the Soviet Union and the three countries, as well as the common security of the Soviet Union, Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania, but have also further developed the economic relations of the signatory countries. At the same time, the Soviet Union believes that it is more necessary to ensure the security of the Soviet-Finnish border. The city of Lenin is the second most important city in the Soviet Union and the birthplace of the October Revolution. It is within the range of enemy artillery fire, and its threat in the current international emergency is self-evident. In the Soviet-Finnish negotiations, the Soviet Union made concessions everywhere, but still there were [missing text] certain results. The peace treaty signed by the Soviet Union and Finland on March 12 has dealt a fatal blow to those who provoked the war in Northern Europe. The Red Army destroyed the Karelian Line (which was considered impregnable by British and French experts). The Soviet government's conspiracy against neutral countries, these countries have now been given peace, all threats to undermine their independence and force them to join the war have passed. This fact has been proven by the newspapers of Scandinavian and Baltic countries. The Soviet-Finnish peace treaty signed on March 12 is more important than the relationship between the signatory countries. The treaty is clear evidence of the success of the Soviet Union's peace policy. First, the treaty proves that the Soviet Union does not make demands that impede the dignity and independence of small countries, whether in diplomatic negotiations or after military victory. Second, the treaty proves that all small countries that rely on "guarantees" have become tools of others, and only by adopting an independent and wise policy can they avoid tragic consequences. Finally, the treaty shows that the Soviet Union's demands are reasonable, and can be realized in the shortest time even in adverse circumstances. The Soviet people expressed their welcome to this treaty, not only that, but also the true advocates of world peace must express their warm welcome." (TASS dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>US Moral Embargo Policy Towards the Soviet Union Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>Washington – Secretary of State Hull recently replied to inquiries while hosting reporters that although the Soviet Union and Finland have established a peace treaty, the US government's policy on "spiritual embargo measures" may not be changed as a result. Observers commented that President Roosevelt issued a statement yesterday condemning the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, and US public opinion has already been encouraged. For this reason, the "spiritual embargo measures" will definitely be continued. (Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Zhu Jiahua on the European War: No Disadvantage to China (Continued) China's Diplomacy is Skillful and Bears an Important Mission for World Peace</h3>
<p>3. Comparison of Strengths</p>
<p>Before we analyze the current economic situation of the belligerent countries, let's first examine the manpower of both sides. The combined population of the main players, Britain and France, is 84 million. Although the population of their territories can be mobilized, it is not the main source and does not need to be counted. This is less than the 170 million of Imperial Russia, the more than 40 million of Italy, and the 120 million of the United States in the last World War. On the German side, since annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia, excluding the Czechs, the population is 80 million. Compared with the last World War, the population of Bulgaria and Turkey has decreased. However, compared to the situation in the last war where almost the whole world was against Germany, Germany clearly has the advantage in manpower this time. As for how the comparison of manpower will be in the future when both belligerent parties are striving to develop their countries, it is difficult to say at this moment.</p>
<p>Such is the manpower situation. In terms of material resources, Britain and France have an absolute advantage. Since its defeat in the last war, Germany's cash foreign exchange and overseas investments have plummeted compared to before the war. Although it has automatically lifted the restrictions of the Treaty of Versailles in recent years, the result of fulfilling the treaty for ten years after the war, and the unlimited expansion of the military for the past five years, has left it with exhausted resources. Compared to the wealth it possessed in 1914, which no one could have foreseen, the feeling of comparing the past and the present is overwhelming. Simply put, before September of last year, the living conditions of the German people were already in a wartime state. Statistics also tell us that Britain cannot be self-sufficient in too many materials. For example, in terms of food, despite continuous efforts in agriculture and the success of the Four-Year Plan after the war, it can only achieve 85% self-sufficiency. In addition, it needs to import miscellaneous grains from Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries. There is a particular shortage of fats. Including all of Austria and Czechoslovakia, the output is only 3 million tons, which is not enough and needs to be supplied by Romania and the Soviet Union. Although military industries have some copper, iron sand, etc. produced, they are insufficient and must be purchased from Yugoslavia or obtained from Sweden. Raw materials for the textile industry must be imported wool from South Africa and Australia, and cotton from the United States, Brazil, Egypt, and India. These items, on which the people's daily lives depend and which are needed for the supply of the army during wartime, can still be obtained from neutral neighboring countries, but most sources will be affected by the blockade of the superior navies of Britain and France, leading to a complete cut-off of supplies.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that Britain and France have abundant material resources. The same is true in terms of financial resources. Comparing Germany's possessions with those of Britain and France, the difference is too great. The combined gold reserves and foreign investments of Britain and France are 1,418 million, while Germany has only 130 million. The average annual income per person is only 62 pounds in Germany, which further illustrates that the contribution of each Briton to the country in terms of financial resources is many times greater than that of each German.</p>
<p>4. German-Soviet Relations</p>
<p>Given the economic disparity between Germany and Britain and France, why is Germany confident in supporting this war? Is it a blitzkrieg? It seems that Hitler does not have this delusion. Because of this, on the eve of the war, he suddenly changed his plan and reconciled with the Soviet Union, an enemy in politics and ideology, establishing a non-aggression pact and a trade agreement. Knowing that a blitzkrieg was not allowed by objective facts, he had to accept foreign aid, especially hoping that the Soviet Union would provide economic assistance. Bismarck once stated in his book "Thoughts and Memories" the danger of Germany fighting on both the east and west fronts at the same time. Wilhelm II originally adhered to this advice and made enemies with Imperial Russia, resulting in failure. Hitler, in view of this, made a sudden change. Passively, he could avoid worrying about the east, and actively, he could obtain economic assistance. This cannot be regarded as unwise and is hated by the Allied countries. However, to what extent and with what limitations can the Soviet Union provide economic support to Germany?</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's assistance to Germany is first hindered by psychological factors. Although Germany and the Soviet Union are currently mutually beneficial and complementary, it cannot be denied that the Soviet Union does not want to see Germany rashly gain a leading position in Europe. Therefore, the rumors of a military alliance between Germany and the Soviet Union are just air and propaganda, and at least at this stage, there is no possibility of realization. Based on this inference, political reasons will inevitably affect the components of political connectivity. Moreover, although the Soviet Union's production volume in recent years has increased fourfold compared to the past, due to the improvement of the living standards of its own people and the increase in needs, the surplus that can be exported is not large. Although Germany is good at using its credit loans to increase trade with the Soviet Union, and thereby hopes to seize control of Soviet trade (the commercial agreement established on August 19, 1939, was based on this), and although the 200 million mark loan to the Soviet Union in 1926, the so-called Piatakov Agreement in 1932, and the subsequent 200 million mark loan in 1935, increased Germany's import trade with the Soviet Union to 47%, which is 24% of Germany's total exports, and although Hitler once proudly said about this that what could be done before can be done now and can be continuously increased, however, the Soviet Union's exports to Germany are aimed at exchanging for Germany's industrial products, which are urgently needed by Germany itself during wartime, and there is no large surplus. The burden on German industry has already become heavy, and it has reached a point where it cannot reciprocate as scheduled. Therefore, the future of the barter trade policy is not optimistic on the German-Soviet side. To rashly talk about cash transactions... (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Guidance for Middle School Students (2)</h3>
<p>— Wang Maozu</p>
<p>(3) "Vigilance and Reflection": In the past, the general leaders of young people in society, in order to awaken the masses, certainly had to be very passionate and fully stimulating in order to achieve rapid results. However, the methods they adopted resulted in many malpractices, leading to the development of habits of vanity and impatience, and the loss of a calm and persevering moral character. They only allowed emotions to run wild, and the so-called "moving the mind and enduring the nature" could no longer be seen. Moreover, after excessive excitement, young people easily tend to become decadent after setbacks. Now, having received unprecedentedly difficult lessons, they know that the War of Resistance and national construction cannot be achieved by empty shouts and emotional clamor. Therefore, those responsible for guidance should also be aware that on the one hand, they must constantly remind students of the national crisis and survival, and on the other hand, they must make students reflect on the historical causes and consequences and their own responsibilities at all times, and cultivate a calm and persevering spirit. This kind of character is most needed in the process of the War of Resistance and national construction.</p>
<p>(4) "Physical Training and Temperance": Physical training inherently contains mental training. Generally, people with strong physiques are able to endure hardship and can control impulses and overcome difficulties. Those who are weak are certainly unable to endure hardship, but it is now proven that even those who are strong are not necessarily able to endure hardship, and are not necessarily able to restrain their desires. The weak are just the opposite. The reason for this is that physical education in the past only pursued novelty, and was limited to trophy-style training in cities. Moreover, the general physical education teachers were really too poor in cultivating life sciences. This is the separation of mental training from physical fitness. Hard work is a habit. General physical exercises mostly focus on cultivating skills, which is unrelated to this habit. Now, we must focus on cultivating the habit of enduring hardship from the perspective of physical education, and cultivating the temperance of desires from the perspective of hygiene. However, the training methods must still refer to the individual's health status, and gradually advance from reluctant to natural.</p>
<p>(5) "Punishment and Sanctions": Punishment is essentially a negative method. It must be used properly so that students understand the reasons for being punished and consciously repent. Students are more afraid of criticism from their classmates than being recorded for demerits by the school. Therefore, the criticism of public opinion among classmates can be used as a method of sanction. However, young people's emotions are often biased and irrational. Therefore, in order to utilize peer sanctions, students must be taught to have a correct judgment of right and wrong.</p>
<p>4. Guiding Principles for Life Guidance</p>
<p>Life guidance is originally very cumbersome. This article only explains some principles, which are divided into two main outlines as follows:</p>
<p>(A) General Life Guidance</p>
<p>President Chiang Kai-shek has said that the New Life Movement is the life of the modern citizen, that is, the life of wartime. The six principles of the New Life Movement—orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, promptness, and certainty—are all essential elements and standards of military life. The foundation of all education lies in teaching the general public to practice the New Life Movement. He also said, "If the living habits of ordinary young students cannot be improved, all education will fail." How alarming and earnest are these words! It can be seen that there is no so-called knowing except according to the outline of the New Life Movement. At present, middle schools have not yet been able to fully and earnestly implement these six standards. In fact, these six standards are only basic exercises. What is more important is to deeply cultivate the concepts of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and then the character of the students can be strengthened. Therefore, at the Third National Education Conference, President Chiang Kai-shek personally proposed propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as the unified school motto for the whole country, and explained that "propriety" teaches the people to help each other, cooperate, abide by discipline, and maintain order; "righteousness" teaches the people to be chivalrous, brave, responsible, and willing to sacrifice; "integrity" teaches the people to be thrifty, hardworking, separate public and private interests, and understand their duties; and "shame" teaches the people to be self-reliant, able to strive, and know how to progress. Of course, propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame cannot be achieved by perfunctory spiritual speeches. They must be guided and inspired from pointing out daily life and participating in group activities, using the various methods mentioned above. For example, to teach students to "be responsible," they must be made to do a part of things in group life in order to have a sense of responsibility. To teach "integrity," it is best to start with cherishing public property. To understand "shame," of course, start from unfavorable actions and areas where they are inferior to others to stimulate their sense of shame. As for the teaching of "propriety," schools now only teach students to be "polite" and "maintain order," which is only an external appearance. In fact, the essence of propriety is a norm of the human heart, and one must distinguish on one's own initiative in terms of motivation. Not only is it necessary to strengthen the external response of students, but also to train internal reflection. Few educators today understand this meaning.</p>
<h3>Xie Shuying, Inspector of the Ministry of Education, Dismissed</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 15th) The National Government issued an order on the 15th stating that Xie Shuying, Inspector of the Ministry of Education, will be assigned to another position. Xie Shuying should be relieved of his current position. This order.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shousong Goes to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Zhang Shousong, the former inspector of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau in this city, took up teaching positions at the private Lehua Middle School and Yi Girls' Middle School after the war. Last August, he engaged in voluntary education inspection and guidance, exerting utmost effort, and was deeply appreciated by the education administrative supervisors. He was determined to be loyal and strictly abide by his post. Now, because there is a great need for talent in the rear, he has left Shanghai for Chongqing. While in Hong Kong, he specifically published an advertisement in Shanghai newspapers expressing his future obedience to President Chiang Kai-shek, support for the War of Resistance and national construction policies, and his determination to fight to the end.

<h3>Composition Books for Middle School Students</h3>

<h3>City Residents Oppose Tax Increases; Municipal Council Reduces Budget</h3>
<h3>By Over Two Million Dollars Compared to Draft; Justifications Offered for Increased Expenditures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council for the Public Concession, due to budgetary deficits, proposed increasing various taxes and duties, which citizens have objected to. These situations have been repeatedly reported. Now, the Municipal Council has released a draft budget that has been significantly reduced, which is worthy of study. The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Justification for Increased Expenditures</p>
<p>The draft budget for various departments of the Municipal Council for this year has been examined and significantly reduced. All reductions have been reported by the Treasurer to the Finance Committee. Now, a summary is provided for the reference of all taxpayers. Taxpayers who criticize the Council's excessive spending should pay attention to the following two points: (1) If the exchange rate does not fall below eight pence, the Council's income can often offset regular expenses. (2) Which of the Council's expenses should be reduced? The Council welcomes all constructive suggestions. The Council members are elected by taxpayers, and their task is to maintain public safety, order, and sanitation effectively and economically. What kind of comfortable environment taxpayers need and how much they are willing to pay should be decided by the taxpayers themselves. The Council's expenses are affected by the depreciation of the national currency, not just salaries. It has been clearly stated that the draft budget for various departments of the Council had already been reduced by more than two million dollars before being submitted to the Finance Committee. However, due to the recent high prices of food, the Council's budget had to be increased by more than one and a half million dollars again. For example, the cost of food for prisoners in prisons should be increased by 600,000 dollars from the original budget to cope with the situation. (Food for prisoners is borne by the state in all countries, not by municipal authorities.) Recently, rice subsidies have begun to be paid to low-ranking Chinese staff, which is estimated to cost around 900,000 dollars this year, and this was not included in the original budget.</p>
<p>Detailed Numbers of Budget Reductions</p>
<p>When the various departments of the Council were preparing their budgets, they were instructed to reduce them as much as possible while maintaining good administrative efficiency and striving for economy. Therefore, the draft budget was heavily cut by the Treasurer in conjunction with the heads of various departments. The relevant committees made significant contributions to this matter, which was very helpful. As a result, more than two million dollars were reduced in total. The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<p>Volunteer Corps: The original budget for the Volunteer Corps was $1,264,376. After revision, it was changed to $1,242,720, an increase of $358,120 over the previous year.</p>
<p>Fire Department: The draft budget for the Fire Department was $1,550,867. After revision, it was reduced to $1,515,730, an increase of $351,000 over the previous year.</p>
<p>Police Department: The draft budget for the Police Department was $15,915,270, of which prison maintenance costs accounted for $2,800,000. Now, due to rising food prices for prisoners, it is necessary to increase it by $600,000. At the same time, the amount of subsidies for foreign prisoners held in custody will be increased, and the First Special District Court will be asked to adjust the salaries of the Council's staff stationed in the hospital. The above budget has been revised again, and the result is $16,402,900, an increase of $4,490,780 over the previous year.</p>
<p>Health Department: The draft budget was $2,782,250. After revision, it was changed to $2,423,260, an increase of $534,610 over the previous year. According to the Treasurer, the reason for the reduction of the above budget is mostly due to the proposed increase in fees. However, if the number of applications from citizens is greatly reduced due to the increase in fees, the desired good results will not be obtained. In addition, if there is an epidemic this year, the Director of Health may submit a supplementary budget to cope with it.</p>
<p>Public Works Department: The draft budget was $6,452,900. After revision, it was reduced to $5,087,270, an increase of $868,220 over the previous year.</p>
<p>Municipal Orchestra: The draft budget was $236,220, which exceeded the prescribed amount by $236,220. The Music Committee suggested using all of the orchestra's reserves and increasing the fees for performances and rehearsals to make up for the shortfall. Therefore, the orchestra's budget for this year has been revised to the fixed amount of $200,000.</p>
<p>Finance Department: The budget was $1,528,260, an increase of $238,540 over the previous year.</p>
<p>Revenue Department: The draft budget was $745,039. After revision, it was reduced to $709,900, an increase of $162,810 over the previous year.</p>
<p>Legal Department: The draft budget was $220,212. After revision, it was reduced to $213,750, an increase of $35,640 over the previous year.</p>
<p>Chinese Department: The draft budget was $149,410. After adjustment, it was increased to $150,370, an increase of $37,180 over the previous year.</p>
<p>Possible Layoffs of Foreign Staff</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that there are rumors in the city that the Municipal Council may lay off several foreign staff members again, and it is expected that the most layoffs will be in the Public Works Department. However, the Council remains silent on this matter. The Municipal Council laid off staff three or four years ago, and now there are rumors of layoffs again, which has caused great indignation in some quarters. Others have mixed feelings. According to a Municipal Council employee who may be laid off, he is not worried about being laid off. When the previous batch of employees were laid off, the conditions were very good. If the Council offers satisfactory severance terms, he would be happy to retire. As for how the Council will raise the severance pay, that is the Council's business and has nothing to do with him. Other employees expressed dissatisfaction, saying that they had been moved by the Municipal Council's salary, pension regulations, severance pay, and other preferential terms many years ago, and had resigned from good jobs to work for the Municipal Council. The preferential treatment has been reduced, and they are considering resigning. It is said that some qualified employees of the Council have either resigned or are planning to leave because they believe that the original preferential terms have been greatly changed and are not worth staying for.</p>
<h3>Bombing in Pinghu City; Two Japanese Soldiers Injured</h3>
<p>According to a person from Pinghu, the details of the Pinghu bombing are as follows: On the morning of the first of this month, when several Japanese soldiers were passing by the Tongji Restaurant on South Main Street in Pinghu City, several hand grenades were suddenly thrown from the upstairs of the restaurant. They exploded on the spot, and two Japanese soldiers were seriously injured. The order was chaotic for a time, and pedestrians and police avoided the area. The Japanese soldiers received the news and immediately rushed to the scene with a large force, setting up machine guns and opening fire as a show of force, but they did not catch the grenade thrower. Afterwards, the restaurant was closed for several days because of this.</p>
<h3>Four Banks to Offer Short-Term Acceptance Bills to Promote Active Finance in Various Industries</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's recommendation from the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank to promote acceptance bills has been approved, and the local banking guilds in various regions have been ordered to comply. Reporters from the "New Voice" learned from banking circles yesterday that the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank will soon offer short-term acceptance bills in accordance with the regulations for promoting acceptance bills. All measures have been determined, aiming to promote the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce and to invigorate local finance.</p>
<h3>U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Gauss, Scheduled to Go to the U.S. Early Next Month; To Leave Shanghai Aboard the President Hoover; Various Groups in Shanghai Schedule Farewell Banquets</h3>
<p>U.S. Consul General to Shanghai, Gauss, was ordered to be promoted to the first Minister to Australia. However, he has not yet received a telegram from the State Department in Washington, so he is still in Shanghai. According to consulate sources, Gauss is scheduled to leave Shanghai and return to the U.S. on April 2 aboard the President Hoover of the American President Lines. He will first report to the authorities in Washington, then meet his wife and son, Charles, spend some time in the U.S., and then return to his new post on schedule. It is said that Gauss will assume his new post in the capital of Australia in mid-July of this year.</p>
<p>Public Banquets</p>
<p>The American expatriate community in Shanghai, because Gauss has been supported by all parties during his tenure in Shanghai, have been sending invitations for public banquets to Gauss. It is reported that the American Chamber of Commerce and the American Association will jointly hold a banquet on the 30th of this month at the Columbia Country Club. The American Associated University Association will invite all staff of the American Consulate and Gauss himself to a dance and dinner party on the 27th of this month at the American Club. Foreign journalists will hold a banquet for Gauss on the 28th of this month in the "Gold Room" of the American Club. Gauss also attended a farewell banquet held by the Japanese Consul General to Shanghai, Miura, on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Gauss's Brief History</p>
<p>Gauss is 53 years old and is a well-known diplomat. He joined the government in 1906 and was transferred to the Shanghai Consulate in 1907. He successively served as Counselor of the Embassy in Peiping and Consul General in Shanghai, before being transferred to the State Department in Washington. The following year, he was transferred to the position of Consul General at the Embassy in Paris. He has served in China for 33 years. During his time in China, he has traveled extensively in Peiping, Tientsin, Shanghai, Amoy, Jinan, Shenyang, and other places.</p>
<p>Central Figure</p>
<p>During his tenure, he was seen by all parties as a central figure as the Sino-Japanese War occurred. He interacted with all parties and gained the trust and love of the American expatriate community. He handled official duties day and night, with almost no peaceful days. On November 22 of last year, he met with Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, on the flagship "Augusta," and paid a visit to the U.S. Ambassador. On the morning of the 23rd, he accompanied Admiral Hepburn to the Philippines to participate in the Far East Conference in Cuba, Philippines. In addition to Gauss and Admiral Hepburn, the U.S. High Commissioner to the Philippines, Sayre, also attended, which was called the "Three Giants Conference." At that time, the Far East countries paid great attention to the Philippine Conference, especially the U.S. interests in the Far East and the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty. Gauss's trip back to the U.S. will be to report to his superiors on the results of last year's meeting.</p>
<p>Successor</p>
<p>On January 8 of this year, he was ordered by the State Department to be promoted to the first Minister to Australia. The position of Consul General here has not been decided by the authorities, so it has been delayed. Only his wife and son left last month. The consulate has not been notified of the successor to the position of Consul General here, and the State Department has not issued any orders. It is generally believed that Mr. Lockhart, Counselor of the Embassy in Peiping, will temporarily replace him, because Mr. Lockhart has twice acted as Gauss's replacement during his absence. When Gauss left Shanghai for the Philippines last winter, he was also replaced by Lockhart. According to Mr. Lockhart, he is also familiar with the situation in Shanghai, but in terms of diplomatic history, he seems to be inferior to Gauss. It is said that Gauss has a deep sense of reluctance to leave his second hometown, China.</p>
<h3>U.S. President and Queen of the Netherlands to Broadcast to Shanghai; Listening Time is 3 AM Tomorrow Morning; Speeches on the Overseas Situation of Christianity</h3>
<p>U.S. President Roosevelt and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands will speak on the overseas work of Christianity at a meeting in New York this morning. U.S. President and the Queen will speak separately. President Roosevelt's speech will generally hope that Christianity will receive fair and appropriate donations on the world stage, and that Christian churches and other smaller churches will receive U.S. donations and fair distribution. Father Tuji will be the chairman of the conference. President Roosevelt and the Queen will also broadcast on the radio at 7 PM this afternoon. The listening time in Shanghai will be 3 AM tomorrow morning (i.e., 3 AM on Sunday morning).</p>
<h3>Registration Method for Stock of Domestically Produced Yarn and Fabrics</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new regulations for applying for certificates of origin for domestically produced yarn and fabrics, the sales invoices or invoices of Chinese-owned yarn factories have been used as the basic supporting documents. Yarn factories are also required to issue a sales voucher as proof. Now, because the inventory of raw materials purchased by various factories in the past should have a registration method for auditing and verification, the relevant guilds and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have agreed on the following methods: (1) Inventory registration: Factories that directly use yarn to manufacture dyed, woven, knitted underwear, handkerchiefs, etc. should use the original tax-paid certificate of the yarn and cloth factory as the basis. (2) Cotton cloth merchants and some factories that purchase yarn and cloth from dyeing and weaving factories to produce knitted underwear, handkerchiefs, and other products are allowed to use the sales invoices or invoices of Chinese-owned dyeing and weaving factories as registration documents. (3) Shenxin, Wing On, and other seventeen yarn factories have recently published advertisements in newspapers stating that all yarn sold before March 1 that has a bank or exchange warehouse receipt can be registered and supplemented with a sales voucher. Therefore, the stock of yarn for which sales vouchers can be supplemented should still be based on the vouchers. (4) The inventory registration event should be completed by the end of March. The various guilds have been notified to comply.</p>
<h3>British Women's Association Urges Voting in Municipal Council Election; The Association will Assist Members in the Process</h3>
<p>The 1940 annual election of the Municipal Council of the Public Concession will be held on the 10th and 11th of next month. The candidates for British and American directors have been selected separately. It is reported that the British Women's Association of this port held a meeting at its headquarters on the afternoon of the 13th. The chairman, Mrs. Kahn, reported and urged voting in the election. It was stated that the most important thing is to participate in the election of the Municipal Council directors this year. Every member should engage in commerce, but also pay attention to this election. If members have any questions, the secretariat of the association will do its best to help each member. During the two European wars, the association worked hard to promote the raising of war funds, which was very tense.</p>
<h3>Coal Dust Stockpiles Increase, But Coal Prices Must be Quickly Stabilized; Reduction in Transportation Costs is Expected to be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>The price of fuel in Shanghai has soared previously due to the doubling of water transport costs and the hoarding of spot goods. Hotels, bathrooms, and cooked water shops have temporarily closed or are considering raising prices, which has invisibly increased the expenses of ordinary people. Due to the high cost of coal, the cost of production in factories has increased, and production has decreased. This is a major concern for Shanghai. Now, due to the smooth flow of sources and the abundance of spot goods in the market, people's hearts have become more stable. With the ceasefire between the Soviet Union and Finland, large investors have no intention of aggressively hoarding, and small investors are waiting and watching. The spot market is rarely visited. The prices of various fuels are gradually falling. Moreover, bituminous coal blocks arrive in port every other day and are unloaded into coal warehouses, so the coal block inventory is also increasing day by day. The Coal Industry Association is currently registering coal stocks. It is reported that about 10,000 tons have been registered. It is hoped that all coal companies will quickly register with the association to facilitate statistics.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, at the request of the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association, is trying to help small coal briquette factories so that they can continue to ship goods and supply the market. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that the association's statement is factual. However, this matter is of great importance and must be discussed at length. It has been decided to convene a joint meeting of all coal dust companies at the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Hong Kong Road this afternoon at 3 PM to discuss the allocation of cheap coal dust. Yi Tai Hing, Da Long Hing, Tong Cheng, Han Cheng, and other coal companies will be invited to attend and participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>Clearing Warehouse Stock</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously announced jointly with the coal industry and related groups that the deadline for clearing the coal briquette warehouse stock for those holding tickets was yesterday. A total of more than 20,000 tons were cleared yesterday. Yesterday, the person in charge of the industry association said that the spot goods of coal briquettes will increase in the future. If the cost of coal transportation is reduced, the price of briquettes can be lowered. It is also reported that the coal briquette manufacturers are working day and night to supply the market, increasing the spot goods. If this can be maintained permanently, panic can be reduced.</p>
<p>Supporting the Water Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Industry Association previously agreed to supply cheap Kai Ping coal dust at the request of the cooked water industry. The coal industry agreed to their request and designated three members, Yi Tai Hing, Hua Zhong, and Yuan Tai, to supply one ton of cheap coal each at a price of 98 yuan. The cooked water industry immediately announced to its members that they would resume business and were very grateful for the coal industry's enthusiasm. Now, the Coal Industry Association believes that the cooked water shops are all small businesses and are closely related to the livelihood of ordinary people, so it is willing to continue to supply cheap coal. It is currently being planned, and once it is ready, it can be applied for. It is said that the market price will be lower than the first time.</p>

<h3>Customs Revenue in Occupied Areas Intercepted; Estimated at 43 Million Dollars; China's Current Inability to Repay Debts; Responsibility Clearly Does Not Rest with China</h3>
<p>The Chinese government has long been determined to maintain creditworthiness. Since the customs revenue in the occupied areas was intercepted in 1938, it has been necessary to set up another method of repayment for the debts guaranteed by customs duties, which is only a temporary phenomenon. However, to show its sincere intentions, all customs duties under Chinese control have been deposited in the Central Bank for the repayment of foreign debts, and converted into foreign exchange at the legal rate. As for the intercepted customs revenue, which is deposited in the Yokohama Specie Bank, the total amount as of the end of last year was 43,153,000 dollars. This deposit can only be resolved after the end of the Sino-Japanese War. Therefore, China's current inability to repay domestic and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties is not China's responsibility, which is a very obvious fact. The estimated customs duties intercepted in the main customs offices in 1938 and 1939 are listed below (excluding the customs offices in the three northeastern provinces):</p>
<p>Customs Office 1938 1939</p>
<p>Qinhuangdao $4,540,000 $6,350,000</p>
<p>Tianjin Customs $56,440,000 $67,590,000</p>
<p>Donghai Customs $4,020,000 $4,740,000</p>
<p>Jiao Customs $8,870,000 $28,450,000</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs $83,730,000 $166,800,000</p>
<h3>Japanese Izumo Warship, Which Suddenly Left Port a Few Days Ago, Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Japanese flagship Izumo suddenly sailed out of the Huangpu River at about 11 AM on the 11th. It has now returned to Shanghai yesterday and is still docked at the China Merchants Wharf.</p>
<h3>U.S. Transport Ship, Gold Star, Leaves Shanghai Yesterday; Guam Arrives Here from Wuhu Yesterday; Luzon Scheduled to Sail West Next Monday</h3>
<p>The U.S. transport ship Gold Star arrived in Shanghai with a heavy load from the Guam Naval Base on the 6th of this month. It left Shanghai yesterday afternoon to take this Hong Kong, Xiao Luzon, back to Guam. The U.S. Yangtze River gunboat Guam, which has been anchored in Wuhu for nearly a month, also arrived here at 3 PM yesterday afternoon. Rear Admiral Glassford, Commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Flotilla, will change his flag to the Guam. Luzon is scheduled to set sail for Wuhu for defense next Monday. There are rumors that the U.S. Asiatic Fleet will come to Shanghai for a spring tour, but the U.S. Navy in Shanghai has not confirmed it.</p>
<h3>Aboard the Sinking Jingsheng Wheel; The Passengers' Screams Were Tragic; The Authorities' Negligence is Regrettable</h3>
<p>The situation of the sinking of the Jingsheng Wheel in Ningbo, according to Mr. Zhan, who works in the medical field, was very tragic. He also had some criticisms of the local authorities' negligence. For the sake of past experience and future consideration, the situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>General Information About the Ship</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhan, the Jingsheng Wheel in Ningbo has a gross tonnage of only 160 tons, a length of 95 feet, a width of 16 feet, a depth of 8 feet, and a draft of 6 feet. It was built in 1904 and has a horsepower of 150. It can sail about 9 nautical miles per hour. The bottom of the ship is pointed, not flat. The maximum number of passengers allowed on the ship is 298. The ship has always sailed between Ningbo and Zhenhai. After the establishment of the Ningbo Barge Transportation Company, it joined as a barge passenger ship, traveling between Ningbo and Zhenhaikou.</p>
<p>Passenger Situation</p>
<p>On the morning of the 2nd, the ship arrived in Yong from Zhenhaikou with passengers from the De Ping Wheel, and docked at the Sanbei Wharf on the Jiangbei bank. Passengers disembarked one after another. At that time, passengers waiting to board the Moufu Wheel hired ferry boats to the outside of the ship to board the cabin. The number of people was quite crowded. At about 1:50 PM, the Ningbo Air Defense Monitoring Post issued an air raid alert. At that time, I and four of my relatives and friends were also afraid of a ferry boat and planned to board the ship and take the Moufu Wheel back to Shanghai. When the ferry boat was about to approach the stern of the ship, I saw that the passengers on the ship were full, and the ship was overwhelmed. Because I was wary, I did not dare to board the ship.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Accident</p>
<p>At that time, the crew was still urging me to board the ship. However, my relatives and friends on the boat shared my views and decided to take the next barge. I ordered the crew to row back. In an instant, the ship had already undocked. I suddenly saw the ship leaning outward, very sharply. The whole ship was crying and shouting, and the situation was extremely tragic. In less than two minutes, the ship had sunk to the bottom of the water. At that time, the sound of crying stopped suddenly. Passengers in the cabins and middle cabins jumped into nearby ferry boats and into the water. However, the number of people was limited. Those who fell into the water mostly did not know how to swim and drowned tragically. The scene at that time was so sad that it cannot be described in words.</p>
<p>Responsibility</p>
<p>About a quarter of an hour after the ship sank, the Air Defense Post continued to issue an emergency alert. However, Japanese planes had already entered the country. The alert was lifted after about 20 minutes. At that time, the military police and rescue teams were all dispatched to rescue. The Xinjiang Bridge was also crowded with onlookers, and the situation was suddenly tense. At this time, four passengers who had escaped had jumped onto the ferry boat I was on and were taken ashore. Eight lives on one boat were lucky to survive. Mr. Zhan talked about the Ningbo Barge Transportation Company's excessive leniency in limiting the number of passengers, the lack of strict inspection by the shipping authorities, and the lack of discipline among passengers in public order, and expressed deep regret. The lives of the people in this extraordinary period should not be sacrificed in such a meaningless way.</p>
<p>Learn from the Past</p>
<p>According to news from the shipping industry in this port, since the sinking of the Jingsheng barge in Ningbo, the authorities are actively planning to improve the method of barging passengers on ships between Yong and Zhen. In addition to considering increasing the number of direct Shanghai-Ningbo ships within the possible scope, the Ningbo Shipping Administration and the military and political authorities will strictly regulate the method of barging passengers and goods. Five implementation methods have now been drafted: (1) In accordance with the regulations of the Zhejiang Provincial Shipping Administration, all ships traveling in inland rivers and offshore seas must be strictly inspected. (2) The number of passengers must be limited and must not exceed the regulations of the Administration and the Zhejiang Customs. (3) The weight of cargo must not exceed the deadweight tonnage. (4) Passengers must enter and exit the ship separately to maintain order. (5) The police authorities will send personnel to maintain order at the wharves. The above methods will be announced and implemented after the various agencies have discussed and agreed on them. Regarding the bodies of the Jingsheng sinking ship, the Aftermath Committee is still continuing to salvage them. On the morning of the 14th, another five male and female bodies were retrieved.</p>

<h3>Lido Ballroom Owner Gao Xinbao Shot Dead - Assassin Lay in Wait in Front of Yipinxiang - Gao Shot as He Stepped Out of Hotel and Entered Car - Died of Three Gunshot Wounds</h3>
<p>Last night around 9 o'clock, a shooting occurred in front of the Yipinxiang Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road. The victim was Gao Xinbao, the owner of the Lido Ballroom, who died on the spot. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Ballroom Owner</p>
<p>Gao Xinbao, a local, was 54 years old. He had a significant amount of potential influence in Shanghai society. He originally lived in a building on Hardoon Road, but later, due to the establishment of the Lido Ballroom on Meadow Lane, he moved his residence to the Lido.</p>
<p>Busy with Social Engagements</p>
<p>Because Gao had extensive social connections, he went out every night for social engagements. Recently, about half a year ago, some friends opened Room 20 in the Yipinxiang Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road, registered under the name "Jin Ji." Gao went there every night to rest, enjoy himself, or play mahjong.</p>
<p>Shot While Entering Car</p>
<p>Yesterday evening around 7 o'clock, Gao arrived at Yipinxiang in his private car, number 11311, and waited until 9:30. His friends had not yet arrived, so the mahjong game did not materialize. At 9:55, Gao got up and walked out of Yipinxiang, crossed the road, and was about to get into the car when, unexpectedly, an assassin who had been lying in wait next to a lamppost near the racetrack's low wall,</p>
<p>Fatal Wounds</p>
<p>Seeing Gao arrive, the assassin suddenly jumped out and fired three shots at Gao in rapid succession, all of which hit him. Gao fell to the ground with a thud, blood gushing out. Nearby police officers rushed over, lifted Gao into the car, and rushed him to Renji Hospital. After a doctor's examination, it was found that he had been shot once in the abdomen, once in the left ear, and once in the left leg. Immediate first aid was administered, but he died soon after due to critical injuries and excessive blood loss.</p>
<p>Assassin Flees</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report, the police dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to arrest the assassin, who had already fled without a trace. Several empty bullet casings were found and are being investigated. Gao's body will be taken to the coroner's office for examination. It is noted that Gao was detained by a certain party in the autumn of last year, claiming that Gao was suspected of something. He was released after ten days.</p>
<h3>Estate Lawsuit Over the Deceased Zhang Yisun, Comprador of Jinlong Foreign Firm - Concubine Accuses Principal Wife of Seizing Assets - Gold Bars, Gold Pounds, Gold Ingots, etc. at Issue - Also 8,000 Bags of Rice and 100,000 Jin of Wine Stockpiled</h3>
<p>The late Zhang Yisun, a native of Ningbo, was a comprador at the Jinlong Foreign Firm at 549 Sichuan Road. He had a wife and a concubine. The wife, Zhang Hu, lives at [address in French]. She has three sons: the eldest, Qi'ang, currently resides at [address in French]; Qi'hong, currently resides at [address in French]; and the youngest, Qi'cheng, currently resides at [address in French]. All three sons are engaged in commerce and live separately. The concubine, Zhang Zhao, is 32 years old this year, a fellow villager of Zhang, and lives at [address in French]. She has one son and one daughter, Zhang Hua and Zhang Xia, both of whom are minors. Zhang Yisun possessed considerable assets during his lifetime, and after his death last spring, an estate dispute arose.</p>
<p>Zhang Zhao, the Concubine</p>
<p>Now, acting as the legal representative, she, along with her son Zhang Hua and daughter Zhang Xia, has engaged lawyer Yuan Dingxin to file a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court's criminal division, accusing Zhang Hu and others of jointly embezzling property. It is claimed that the plaintiff's husband, Zhang Yisun, was engaged in commerce during his lifetime and accumulated a considerable fortune. Unfortunately, he died of illness at the plaintiff's residence at [address in French] on March 14th of last year. However,</p>
<p>The Principal Wife Hu</p>
<p>Li Zi Qi'ang, Qi'hong, Qi'cheng, and others, while the deceased husband's body was still awaiting burial, engaged in the act of seizing the estate, forcibly taking away the personally signed general account books, deeds, passbooks, seals, checkbooks, and the key to the safe deposit box at the China Trust Company from the iron box. Tens of thousands of dollars' worth of assets, including dozens of gold bars, more than two hundred gold pounds, five gold ingots, and gold jewelry, were completely</p>
<p>Stolen and Concealed</p>
<p>Furthermore, they privately sold 8,000 bags of rice and 100,000 jin of wine that the deceased husband had purchased, and divided the proceeds among themselves. The plaintiff, being the concubine of Yisun, naturally has a reasonable share of the estate. Moreover, besides the defendants, Yisun has two children who are both under the plaintiff's guardianship. How could they be allowed to arbitrarily control the estate? Initially, because the deceased husband's remains were not yet interred, she could not bear</p>
<p>To Immediately Initiate Litigation</p>
<p>She repeatedly asked relatives and friends Ma Jiliang and Jiang Yiping to mediate, but to no avail. Therefore, she requests that they be prosecuted. Yesterday, judge Jiang Liquan of the court opened the court to summon them. The first and second defendants did not arrive. Only Zhang Qi'hong and Qi'cheng, accompanied by their lawyers, appeared in court. The two defendants were interrogated separately in court. They admitted to storing 8,000 bags of rice and mortgaging them to Fukang Qianzhuang, etc. After verifying the statements, the court decided to reschedule the hearing to the 22nd of this month. The defendants were released on bail.</p>
<h3>Huge Sum Robbed from Bank of Communications</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning (the 15th) at about 9 o'clock, two employees dispatched by the Bank of Communications at No. 3 Avenue Petain in the French Concession were moving an iron box containing 30,000 yuan in legal tender to its branch at No. 889 Avenue Joffre nearby. At the time, an armed bodyguard was also assigned to accompany and escort them. Unexpectedly, when they were near No. 393 Avenue Petain, four bandits wielding weapons suddenly rushed out, disarmed the bodyguard, and then robbed the iron box. After the bandits obtained the large sum, they escaped in a car that had been prearranged. According to police investigations, the car used by the gang of thieves belonged to the Xiang Sheng Motor Company, with license plate number 18465. Later, it was found near the Xin Kang Li area on Connaught Road. According to the chauffeur of the car, he was instructed by his passengers to drive to Singapore Road. However, when the car reached Jiaozhou Road, two passengers in the car suddenly pulled out guns, forced him to get out of the car, and entered an alley where he was placed under surveillance. At about 9:30, one of the robbers arrived and told the robber who was monitoring him, "The mission is accomplished," and then released him, telling him that the car was now parked on Connaught Road, etc.</p>
<h3>Stolen Car from Two and a Half Years Ago Suddenly Found - Japanese Man Driving it to Obtain License - Detained by Police</h3>
<p>According to the English-language China Press, two and a half years ago, when the Shanghai War was in full swing, a staff member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department, Mr. Stodart, parked his Austin car in an open space in the Shanghai Municipal Council, but it was reported missing. It could not be found. However, the car had theft insurance, so Mr. Stodart had already received compensation from the insurance company. Until the morning of the 12th of this month, a Japanese man drove the car to the license office on Rue Moliere to obtain a license. Police officers checked the car's license plate number and discovered that it was the car that belonged to Mr. Stodart, and that the engine was still in good condition. According to the Japanese man, he bought the car in Nanjing and drove it to Shanghai to obtain a license. The car has now been detained at the Central Police Station. The insurance company may demand to buy it back.</p>
<h3>Punishment for Rice Shop Owner</h3>
<p>Yang Xixiang (31 years old), a native of Luodian, who owns the Yongfa Rice Shop at 895 Rue du Consulat and Route Pere Robert, recently paved the inside of the five-sheng and one-sheng measuring containers used in the store with cement, creating a false bottom of two or three tenths, to exploit the common people and make profits. The matter was discovered by the police on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. They went to expose the secret and arrested the shop owner Yang Xixiang, along with the two measuring containers, and sent them to the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer prosecuted him for violating the law against fraud. After Judge Huang Yan finished hearing the case, the verdict was announced yesterday morning. Yang Xixiang was found guilty of fraud by violating weights and measures and was sentenced to five months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. The two measuring containers were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Saposai Road - Detectives Rushed to Surround and Arrest - Bandits Took Advantage of Opportunity to Escape</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at about 10 o'clock, four robbers suddenly came to the home of Xia Tongfu, a native of Nanhui who was engaged in the rice business, on the second floor of No. 289, an alley on Saposai Road (near the intersection of Rue Pere Robert) in the French Concession. Two of the robbers held pistols, threatening them to remain silent. At the time, the robbers were dividing the loot when one of the maids, an older woman named A'e, took the opportunity to escape out the door and ran to inform the nearby police officer. She telephoned the police station. At that time, the case of the robbery of a huge sum of 30,000 yuan from the Bank of Communications on Avenue Joffre had just occurred less than two hours earlier. The police detectives had not yet unloaded their weapons, so they immediately rushed to the scene by car. More than a hundred Chinese and foreign detectives went and surrounded the alley on all sides, firing several shots in a show of force. Unexpectedly, the robbers were inherently cunning and knew things were not good. They had already abandoned the stolen goods and fled before the police arrived.</p>

<h3>Missing Elementary School Student Case - Kidnappers Sent Letter Demanding Ransom - Intending to Extort 50,000 Yuan - Letter Sent from Benniu</h3>
<p>Zhou Xisheng, a native of Changzhou who runs a coppersmith shop on Gordon Road, has a six-year-old son named Wenzhao. On the afternoon of the 10th of this month, at 3:20, he went to school at the Life Elementary School at No. 1085 of the same road with his older sister Jin Feng. On the way, they met Xu Ronghu, a native of Changzhou who was previously an apprentice at the coppersmith shop in Zhabei. Xu Ronghu spoke to Wenzhao, gave him candy to eat, and then left. Unexpectedly, after school was dismissed, Wenzhao went missing. Therefore, Zhou Xisheng suspects the former shop</p>
<p>Apprentice Xu Ronghu</p>
<p>He was highly suspected, and he twisted him over at the Taiji coppersmith workshop at 120 Great West Road and handed him over to the Putuo Road police station for delivery to the First Special District Court. He confessed that the child Zhou Wenzhao was abducted by a fellow apprentice Xu Genda and hidden somewhere in Hongkou, etc. He hesitated to offer other confessions and was ordered to be remanded for investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Criminal Court 3 continued the trial. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated that the date was being changed. The victim, Zhou Xisheng, received a</p>
<p>Anonymous Letter</p>
<p>Sent by mail from the Benniu Post Office in Changzhou, stating that if they wanted the child Wenzhao to be returned, they would have to pay 50,000 yuan, otherwise it would be very dangerous. It is presumed that this letter was definitely written by Xu Genda in an attempt to get lucky. Xu is also a native of Changzhou, and Zhou's child was hidden in Changzhou by him, etc. He also requested a postponement. Judge Jiang approved it and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Scarce Source of Chinese Medicine - Selling Price Increases Daily - Only Two Batches of Sichuan Medicine Arrived This Year</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Incident, prices of all industries have risen sharply. Chinese medicine, due to wartime traffic obstacles, has become scarce and prices have increased significantly. According to news from the industry, in the past, Sichuan medicine arrived in Shanghai at least ten times a month. Since the incident, the arrival times have become uncertain. Since the beginning of this year, only two batches have arrived in Shanghai. The first batch arrived in January, and the second batch just arrived a few days ago. The cost of water and freight has increased even more than the first batch, so the selling price must also be slightly increased. According to the survey of medicinal materials, Sichuan lovage and Sichuan eucommia used to be only seventy or eighty yuan per dan, but now they have risen to two hundred and twenty or thirty yuan. Orange pith used to be more than four hundred yuan per dan, but now it has risen to three thousand several hundred yuan. The other increases are also several times higher. The industry once convened a meeting to discuss the price increase issue, and a solution has been decided. The burden has been further increased these past few days.</p>

<h3>Finance - Environment No Longer Favorable for Bulls - Foreign Exchange Buying Gradually Subsides - US Dollar Lengthens, British Gold Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market was affected by the sharp drop of 0.0625 in the overseas exchange rate between the US and the UK. Therefore, the HSBC US dollar quotation in this city was only 6.1875. The Dutch and Japanese exchange rates also shrank, while other exchange rates such as the British exchange rate were stable. The domestic market situation is gradually becoming clear because the environment is no longer favorable for bulls. Furthermore, because HSBC has always been willing to maintain the 4s 1.125d rate, it is said that it has already sold more than 1 million pounds in the past few days. In addition, the US bank also turned to selling intentions on the same day. Most speculators are temporarily watching the situation, and stable investors are also taking profits. Therefore, as a result, except for the spot rate, which remained unchanged, the others all hardened. At the morning opening, the exchange rate fell by more than 0.05, so the British exchange rate continued to be flat and the US exchange rate tightened. Then, speculators and Japanese foreign firms continued to trade futures, causing the US exchange rate to shrink slightly after opening, once quoted at 6.0625. However, the British gold still relied on HSBC to maintain its position and stabilized. Then, as there were many floating shares to be released, and the US bank also sold, it gradually rebounded. By the time of the noon close, it had lengthened to 6.0375. In the afternoon, it was initially flat. Then, as speculators came to settle again, and the US bank was still full of selling intentions, the US exchange rate hardened to 6.0375 by the time of the evening close. The British gold remained at 4s 1.125d. As a result, the British exchange rate was flat, and the US exchange rate loosened by 0.03125. The potential for futures and the spot market have recovered. The April futures rate has returned to the 4s mark.</p>
<p>US-UK Exchange Rate Shrinks Again</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London large bill, both near and far term, rebounded by 0.0625. The New York silver price remained flat, and London gold was stable.

The US exchange rate shrank by 0.0625 against the British exchange rate, unchanged against the Shanghai exchange rate, and down slightly by 0.0275 against the French exchange rate. The Central Bank's quotations for various exchange rates remained the same as before. At the morning opening, the selling price of spot goods at the bank was 4s 1.125d for British gold and 6.03125 for the US exchange rate, which was 0.03125 tighter than the previous close. After opening, speculators immediately came to absorb the forward market. At the same time, Japanese foreign firms were also trading in futures, and foreign banks' supply intentions were weak. Fortunately, HSBC was still willing to supply the spot market, and the futures market also relied on it to stabilize. It is estimated that speculators closed and entered the next month's US exchange rate at 6.00625 at a foreign bank. At that time, the spot US exchange rate was only 6.025. However, there was no shortage of HSBC quotations. The British exchange rate was flat, and the US exchange rate shrank by 0.0625. The silver balance tax was raised by half a point. After that, a bank in Datong was the first to agree to supply sales. Soon, a small number of floating shares came out of the cage, so the market immediately turned stable. It is estimated that a certain bank sold the next month's US exchange rate to a foreign firm at 6.0125, and speculators sold this month's US exchange rate to a certain bank at 6.025. Later, speculators continued to sell this month's US exchange rate to foreign firms at 6.028125, and the next month's US exchange rate at 6.015625 and 6.01875. At that time, the spot price of the US exchange rate also rebounded to 6.0375. The British gold was still at 4s 1.125d. The number of sellers gradually decreased at noon, and the situation stabilized. Until the close, the British gold was called at 4s 1.125d, and the US exchange rate was 6.034375, which was 0.03225 higher than the morning opening. The futures British and US exchange rates were both harder than the morning opening.</p>
<p>US Bank Also Has Selling Intentions</p>
<p>The post-market opened calmly and was still at 4s 1.125d and 6.034375. At that time, a Japanese foreign firm came to absorb. The US bank's spot US exchange rate was 6.034375, but after there was no response, the situation continued to harden due to the fact that speculators came to spit out a little, and there were rumors of a Japanese-Soviet conflict in the market. It is estimated that the British balance for this month was sold to foreign firms at 4s 0.078125, and the US exchange rate for this month was 6.03215, and the profitable next month's US exchange rate was spat out at 6.025. At the same time, the US bank sold the spot US exchange rate to a peer at 6.0375. It was extended to the evening close, with British gold at 4s 1.125d, and the US exchange rate at 6.0375.

<h3>Times Changed - Bullish Golden Market Took Profits at High Prices - Headline Created an Unprecedented High Price of 5,170 Yuan - Drafts Lengthened Creating a Disconnected Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot and black market situation for pure gold, the situation gradually changed, the good scenery has moved, not as the number of days leaping straight up, originally because the foreign exchange is particularly stable, operators continue to look at the rising mind, when frustrated, and in the past who held the goods have obtained huge profits, full of settlement intentions, take advantage of the high prices to come out, the number is not small, the whole day is the most issued by cash account and securities group, the second is sold by scattered lakes, and the customer's eating stomach is thin, only money exchange industry still sees the purchase activity, to the whole day's process, the opening is still high, but step by step, the step down, so the feeling that the head and tail are not connected, the situation is quite obvious, to the morning opening under the competition to buy, once created an unprecedented high peak of 5,170 yuan, then each group sold to the market, and at this time the US exchange rate turned hard, the supply exceeded demand, then turned down, to noon has been small to 5,070 yuan, although slightly rebounded, but the retail investors resold, also pressed to 5,075 yuan, not long after the afternoon opening, then another ten yuan, but at this time a securities group suddenly turned to buying intention, efforts have entered, rose to 5,097 yuan, died because at this time outside The newspaper continued to report loose and hard, and the number of sellers increased again, and there were rumors of Japanese-Soviet conflicts in the market, and the number of people rushing to sell was numerous. Until before the evening close, a low of 5,030 yuan appeared. As a result, it was 5,033 yuan, a decrease of 97 yuan compared to the previous day. The transaction for the whole day was more than 4,000 taels, and the gold ornaments in silver shops also dropped by ten yuan. Customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Fell, White Yuan Weak</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels) first opened, inheriting the remaining prestige of the previous day, and the US exchange rate was still tight, and the atmosphere was still very hot. Money exchange industries, etc., released the market for purchase, resulting in another horizontal jump of 40 yuan at the opening. A certain securities group entered 50 taels of silver from the silver shop for 5,170 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain cash account took the opportunity to come out, plus another securities group also came to pour out, and the situation was unsustainable. It fell by 60 yuan. A certain cash account sold 50 taels to the money exchange industry for 5,110 yuan. After this, a certain gold shop and a certain money exchange industry suddenly came to fish, and the price soared by 45 yuan. The money exchange industry entered 50 taels of securities help for 5,155 yuan. However, the US exchange rate suddenly reported a hardening, and people's hearts went down. A certain silver shop sold on behalf of a scattered multi-sell, coupled with silver shop help and securities help, etc., again saw a sharp drop of 75 yuan. A certain silver shop spat out 50 taels to the money exchange industry for 5,080 yuan. At that time, the securities group had a reinvestment, and a certain silver shop also came to search in, and then rose by another 20 yuan. The gold shop entered 50 taels of a certain silver shop for 5,100 yuan. As a result, the exchange market reported a hardening again, and the selling wind rose again. Cash accounts, money exchange industries, and securities help, etc., rushed to plug, and then pressed by 20 yuan. The securities helped out 50 taels of gold for 5,070 yuan. Nearly closing, a certain silver shop suddenly came to reinvest, and once rebounded by 18 yuan. Died for money exchange industry and a certain cash account resold, and returned to 5,075 yuan for the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the first mountain gold shop came out of a certain gold shop ten taels, still for 5,075 yuan. After a short time, the money exchange industry spat out ten taels to the securities group, inferior to 5,065 yuan. At that time, a certain securities group suddenly absorbed more than 300 taels, and was suddenly pulled up by 32 yuan. The silver shop entered 20 taels of money exchange industry for 5,097 yuan. After the foreign exchange US dollar reported loosening, a certain securities group turned to sell, and the gold shop and retail investors competed to plug, and the price plummeted by 60 yuan. The money exchange industry came out of the silver shop 50 taels for 5,030 yuan. Later, the gold shop entered 50 taels of silver shop help for 5,033 yuan, for the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell back by 97 yuan compared to the previous day. Slightly harder after closing, a silver shop entered ten taels of money exchange industry, as high as 5,050 yuan. The whole day was up and down 140 yuan. The selling price of the cash account's own brand gold was several yuan higher than that of pure gold, and the closing price was reduced by 20 yuan. The current gold is more than 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and both are rarely opened.</p>
<p>Ornaments Hang Down Ten Yuan</p>
<p>At the beginning of the silver shop's ornaments per tael, the Datong Bank still suspended 520 yuan. When it was low at 9:50, it was low by 5 yuan, rebounded by 5 yuan at 10:01, and fell by another 5 yuan at 11 o'clock. It was again low by 5 yuan at 3 pm, and as a result, it was a total of ten yuan less. It is estimated that Datong Bank changed to suspend 510 yuan. The new peer price is the same as the upper price, and the purchase is reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Gradually Rises, Foreign Stocks Rebound</h3>
<p>The securities gray market showed a continued upward trend yesterday, with investor sentiment relatively calm. Optimism regarding British aid to China gradually increased, leading short sellers to cover their positions. This support boosted the confidence of long buyers, and while the range of market price fluctuations was small, the volatility was still within normal parameters. At the close, rumors of contact between the Soviets and Manchuria emerged, pushing gray market prices up by another one or two dimes. In the morning, Lien Ho saw the most short covering, and Hsieh Ta also experienced a surge in demand. Yung Kang and Lien Yi also consistently bought, while Chang Kee, Hung Kang, and Sheng Ta sold. Market prices were firm. In the afternoon, Chiu Feng covered positions, and Lien Yi, Jun Heng, and Hu Ho Kee made purchases. Lien Ho and Hsieh Ta began to release positions, with Yi Chang entering Class C and exiting Class E. Market prices continued to rise slightly. Closing prices were better than the previous day by 1.5 to 3 dimes. Trading volume was around 600,000 yuan. A concise table is provided below:</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Chung Nan Bank were traded at a price of 60 yuan. Yesterday, the stock market opened slightly weaker due to cautious buying, with buyers unwilling to aggressively push prices higher. However, sellers were eager to liquidate, forcing them to sell at the lower opening prices. Subsequently, a surge in buyers cleared the floating positions, and prices began to rise. Trading was moderate in the morning. In the afternoon, the market suddenly became active, with significant trading volume. Jardine Matheson shares surged from an opening low of 108 yuan to close at 116.5 yuan, with buyers still not fully satisfied at that price. Demand for China Land shares was also strong, with the price rising to 13.4 yuan at the close. These two stocks were the highlights of yesterday's trading. Rubber shares opened quietly, with widespread buying interest. Prices also made some progress and closed steadily. The recent consecutive days of decline in raw rubber prices were undoubtedly due to the uncertain exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar, war finances, strict controls, and various other factors.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn Market Experiences Wild Fluctuations, April Futures Trade Opens with Foreign Reductions Converted to One Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market experienced rapid advances and retreats with swift changes, due to the fluctuating US dollar exchange rate, leading to investor uncertainty. In reality, after consecutive days of sharp rises, some profit-takers moved to liquidate positions. However, approaching the 1,000 yuan mark, there was a period of struggle. Currently, there is some demand for actual yarn in the South China region. The March peak for 20-count horse yarn reached 997 yuan, with a low of 970 yuan. April trading has already begun with over one hundred bundles traded at a price of 1,000 yuan, seemingly at a 3/7 split with a fixed price of 120 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning with news of the British pound/US dollar exchange rate weakening to 5.5. Market sentiment was enthusiastic, briefly surging to 997 yuan. However, once this price was reached, there were few buyers, and prices gradually declined to a low of 835 yuan. Buying activity then resumed, pushing prices back up to 991 yuan. Subsequently, news of the US dollar exchange rate tightening and then loosening led to a gradual decline in the market to 971 yuan. According to half-day trading statistics, 2,575 bundles were traded. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was roughly the same as the previous day, with no significant change. Today, 55 bales of cotton yarn were exported to Hong Kong, 60 bales to Tianjin, and 100 bales to Yantai. The amount purchased by each gang is listed as follows:</p>
<h3>Cotton Mills Need Improvement</h3>
<p>Cotton trading was still not weak, and demand from mills gradually improved, resulting in a stable but firm market. In addition, the local inventory is gradually dwindling, so industry sentiment remains optimistic. The factory delivery price for Nantai Cang and Tongzhou cotton has reached 220 yuan. 896 bales of Subei cotton arrived at Tonghua factory. The spot cotton trading situation is listed below:</p>
<p>Another news item reports that New York cotton futures opened firm due to positive news from Liverpool. Later, the market strengthened as spot trading improved and industry players also engaged in some trading. As a result, closing prices were more than ten pounds higher than the previous day. The Indian cotton market also rose yesterday, with projected increases of six rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by more than ten pounds.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market remains quiet due to tight forward exchange rates and high cotton prices. In addition, overseas cotton markets have risen, so trading in the market is rather quiet. Mills remain silent, not planning to purchase raw cotton. The factory delivery price based on a US dollar exchange rate of 6.3125 yuan is listed below:</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Rice Stabilizes, Northern Transport Increases</h3>
<p>The rice market has been on a downward trend recently, experiencing another sharp drop, breaking the early market closing price. Yesterday, the initial sales market was stagnant. Floating speculative households sought to quickly unload inventory, with No. 1 Saigon rice selling for only 42 yuan, Fire Sorted at 41 yuan, 40 yuan and 5 jiao, No. 2 Saigon at 37 yuan and 7 jiao, and Broken Tip at 32 yuan and 3 yuan. However, foreign firms were unwilling to sell off further. Original local rice dealers were still looking to foreign firms as examples. Trading was mostly just short covering, so the number of available units were relatively scarce, and the market turned stable. Buyers took advantage of the low prices, and rice dealers opened this month's prices to foreign firms for original packaged goods; No. 1 Saigon at 51 yuan, No. 2 at 46.5 yuan, No. 2 Siamese at 46.6 yuan, and Small Sorted at 47 yuan for a total of 4-500 tons. Thus, sales in the market gradually turned brisk, and general stores followed suit, with prices rebounding. By the close, the market had recovered all of the declines; No. 1 Saigon at 42.8 yuan, No. 2 at 38 yuan, Fire Sorted at 42 yuan, 41.8 yuan, Small Sorted at 38.5 yuan, and Broken Tip at 34 yuan. While glutinous rice sales were not smooth, sellers were hesitant to lower prices further due to previous losses. As a result, market prices showed no change. Thick and Thin粳, early and late rice showed no increase yesterday. The gray market was still quiet, with no changes in price.</p>
<p>Previously, the local market suffered because local rice was blocked from entering the concessions, causing panic and soaring rice prices. Fortunately, large quantities of foreign rice arrived steadily, so market prices have recently fallen slightly. It is heard that the food panic in North China is even more severe than in the local market, and the puppet regime lacks resources, so it cannot purchase foreign rice in large quantities, raising concerns about public food supply. Merchants have recently purchased from Vietnam and transported rice directly, and some is transshipped from Hong Kong. Northern merchants in Shanghai have also purchased a small amount. It is known that today's Yong Sheng ship to Tianjin, in addition to the 1,191 packages of foreign rice carried from Hong Kong to Yantai and Tianjin, also loaded more than 2,000 packages in Shanghai, 1,121 packages to Tianjin and 1,166 packages to Yantai (祖).</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Stabilize, Factory Prices Said to Increase After Flat Sale Period Ends</h3>
<p>The flour market was initially weak but later stabilized, with few highlights. The continuous decline in sales and limited shipments to the inland and rural areas are the causes for this trend. However, there is talk that factory prices will increase by 3 yuan after the flat sale period ends, so those holding goods are unwilling to sell quickly. The market held firm in the morning. Later in the day, flour prices rose, following the rise in rice prices. Green Cannon brand was at 14.8 yuan, Old Car brand was at 14.45 yuan, and Battleship brand was at 14.2 yuan, with 3-5,000 bags traded. Phoenix flour was at 14 yuan, with 1,000 bags traded. On the 16th, 2,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<p>There was little trading in wheat, and the market was mediocre. Recently, credit has been tight, and merchants and stores have been slow to take inventory, while sellers have been reluctant to lower prices due to high costs. As a result, only three or four truckloads of Wuxi wheat were sold at a price of 24.5 yuan. The market eased slightly.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Sales Not Declining</h3>
<p>Although soybean trading decreased yesterday, the momentum has not waned. Oil mills, inland mills, local stores, and speculators all made inquiries. Market prices showed little significant change. High-quality soybeans rose slightly by 3-4 jiao, while mid-grade soybeans stabilized as the previous market increase was excessive. Combined market transactions included Nanjing soybeans per car at 22 yuan to 21.5 yuan, Yangzhou mountain soybeans per car at 22 yuan to 19.5 yuan, Bengbu soybeans per car at 15.5 yuan, Chuzhou soybeans per car at 23.5 yuan, and Dingjiazhou soybeans at 26.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Shrimp Tails Continue to Ease</h3>
<p>The shrimp tail market has weakened due to slow sales and abundant inventory. The current market opened with mid tails at 218 yuan to 231 yuan, high fields shrimp at 253 yuan, and Kanhao tails at 194 yuan to 197 yuan, down by 20 yuan from the previous market. Domestically produced Wenzhou tails sold for 170 yuan. 37 bales of new Bombay tails arrived, with good color and quality, and were immediately sold at 222.2 yuan.</p>

<h3>Old News Re-Copied: Sixty-Seven Years Ago (325)</h3>
<p>(From this newspaper published in the 12th year of Tongzhi during the late Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Providing Green Beans as Relief</p>
<p>The best way to provide famine relief is to adapt to local conditions and the needs of the time, such as providing money, rice, or congee. My friend came from Henan province and described the dire situation of the famine-stricken people in Xiuwu and Jiyuan. He said: "Currently, there are thousands of miles of barren land, and starving people are everywhere. Fortunately, many philanthropists are overseeing the relief efforts. However, in remote areas, people on the verge of death, even if given money for grain, how can they cook for themselves? These gentlemen travel dozens of miles a day, distributed over the steep mountains, providing assistance to each household. But even if they have the talent, energy, and thought, they are unable to achieve full reach. Therefore, recently, money, grain, and congee have been given out together, and in addition, there is also a provision of green beans. Last year, the green bean harvest in the Suzhou area was very abundant, and the price was also very low. Using this to provide relief to disaster victims has three benefits: because the land in the Northwest is high and dry, the people there are prone to dryness-related ailments, and moreover, starving bodies are even more susceptible. Adding this to congee can benefit the intestines, which is the first benefit. The price of green beans is cheaper than rice, by as much as thirty to forty percent. If one purchases a hundred catties of rice, they can get thirty or forty more catties of green beans. Using this as additional relief can provide for a hundred more people, which can save a hundred more lives. Expanding this, over several months, it can save millions of lives, which is the second benefit. Looking back at the regulations for disaster relief in the past, when encountering a rare disaster and soaring rice prices, green beans are the most unbiased and beneficial option among beans and grains. It also has the effect of general well-being. The weather will soon be getting hotter, and this item will be even more suitable. The words of the ancients are indeed not deceiving. Using this as an example, is today different from what the ancients said? Although the output of these beans, when combined, is not as much as that of millet and wheat, if several hundred catties are purchased for relief, the floating expenses will be reduced, and the real benefits will be much greater. Compared to those who transport grain thousands of miles, how is it that their inclination is reversed, which is the third benefit. All these three benefits are what is called adapting to local conditions and the needs of the time."</p>

<h3>The European War and Crime (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Shi Tao</p>
<p>The Decline in Crime Rate - England</p>
<p>What strange crimes could possibly occur in a darkened London? Would crimes taking advantage of the blackout occur at several times the rate of the past? Before the implementation of the blackout at the start of the war, everyone deeply cherished this thought. In fact, one now hears often of instances of snatching women's purses under cover of darkness. For this reason, recently women no longer carry their purses under their arms, but carry them by hand.</p>
<p>According to the London Metropolitan Police's highest authorities, they understood that the trend of crime following the war had not changed at all. The number of crimes has instead shown a tendency to decline. Most of these are petty theft kinds of crimes. As for robbery cases, those are extremely rare. The authorities consider the decline in crime to be very honorable, and pointed out the following reasons for the decline in crime:</p>
<p>1.  Due to troop mobilization and the need for manpower in industrial sectors.</p>
<p>2.  Police capabilities have doubled compared to pre-war levels.</p>
<p>3.  National unity and joint efforts to overcome national difficulties.</p>
<p>Therefore, the authorities believe that there is no need to seek special methods of suppression for general crimes simply because it is wartime. The authorities' focus is not on uncovering crimes, but on preventing social unrest. The more laborious task, of course, is guarding against enemy spies. They are implementing strict controls on the departure and entry of travelers. Telegrams, letters, and printed materials are all being ruthlessly inspected. In hotels and other places where the public gathers, slogans are posted, such as "Do not be exploited by the enemy; careless talk often leaks central secrets" to remind citizens to pay attention. In England, flooded with exiles from various countries, there is a real need for vigilance in this area.</p>
<p>What is most noteworthy in Britain today is the problem of juvenile delinquency, where children who have left the supervision of their fathers and elder brothers are not attending school in their places of refuge and are committing crimes. The number of these crimes is increasing day by day, thus becoming a problem of social education. As for general crime, it is not becoming more acute because of wartime.</p>
<p>No Crime - France</p>
<p>Of France's total population of 43 million, about six million men are galloping under the banners of the army protecting the motherland. Therefore, those remaining in French society now are only women, children, and elderly men without the vitality to live. Even in peacetime, French newspapers would typically publish no more than one or two crime-related news stories per month. From the start of the war until today, half a year later, it is almost impossible to find a single crime-like criminal act. All the guys who are capable of committing crimes have been drafted to the front lines. However, the reporting of Communism is being carried out vigorously. Originally, the French believed that the orderly progress of each month was not as desirable as the arrival of chaos. Once the motherland is in danger, they will demonstrate extraordinary latent power, with everyone performing actions for which they are responsible. Therefore, today's France is in a state of extreme seriousness. Women have taken on the roles of men. Of course, in this extraordinary period, there are bound to be many unfortunate events, but French women are capable of enduring them.</p>
<p>In today's France, there is no trace of any criminal behavior reflected from the war to be found.</p>

<h3>The Key to Fate</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiayin</p>
<p>The most painful thing in the world is the inability to grasp one's own destiny. The most foolish thing in the world is unconditionally surrendering the key to one's own destiny to others.</p>
<p>However, in our surroundings, there are thousands upon thousands of people who are abandoning their sovereignty over their own destinies and unconditionally surrendering the key to their destinies to others.</p>
<p>The so-called sovereignty over one's destiny refers not only to the spiritual aspect, but also to the physical aspect.</p>
<p>It is said that the number of Chinese people who die from tuberculosis is the highest among all countries in the world. However, due to ignorance, poverty, complacency, fear, superstition, and various other reasons, we have still not made significant progress in tuberculosis prevention. Therefore, every day there are many unfortunate compatriots who are unconditionally handing over their sovereignty over their lives to germs. By the time the disease is incurable, the germs will transfer the key to their destinies to the god of death. At that time, it will be too late to resist or struggle.</p>
<p>Since we know the dangers of tuberculosis, we should quickly face reality and rise up to fight tuberculosis germs. If we want to reclaim our sovereignty over our destinies, and we want to seize the keys to our destinies, we should implement tuberculosis prevention education and support tuberculosis prevention movements.</p>
<p>Psychology</p>
<h3>Mental Hygiene Movement</h3>
<p>— Mo Ming</p>
<p>Mental hygiene is just as important as physical hygiene. Physical hygiene focuses on the health of the body; mental hygiene focuses on the health of the spirit. Strictly speaking, the workings of the spirit are far more complex and elusive than the body, and therefore more prone to disease, so mental hygiene should be given even more attention. Currently, most people overlook this point, which is a serious error. If mental hygiene is neglected, deficiencies will occur in the spiritual aspect, and an individual's thoughts and actions will become abnormal. As a result, relationships between people cannot be adjusted, and various crimes and difficult problems in society will arise from this. If mental illness is not paid attention to, and allowed to gradually deepen, it will eventually turn into madness, which is a truly terrible outcome. Therefore, the mental hygiene movement is a movement that promotes people to pay closer attention to spiritual health. Its goals are very bright, far-reaching, and worthy of praise.</p>
<p>The origin of the mental hygiene movement is a very moving story. We know that humanity has always used inhumane and unreasonable methods to deal with the mentally ill. The darkness and horror of asylums are no less than prisons. In our country, madmen are even believed to be possessed by evil spirits and often suffer cruel and violent treatment. In fact, it is obvious that this wrong method is of no use, but I really don't understand why mankind is always stubbornly clinging to mistakes, allowing the mentally ill to suffer all kinds of tribulations and endure all kinds of hardships for thousands of years, and yet remaining unmoved. However, the humane revolutionary movement to solve the shackles of madmen was launched in a grand and energetic way. This was thirty years ago, when an American college student from Connecticut named Clifford Whittingham Beers, suffered from mental illness and was sent to an asylum, where he spent three years of subhuman life, experiencing all kinds of pain and witnessing all kinds of dark situations. He was deeply stimulated in his heart, and after being discharged from the hospital, he vowed to devote the rest of his life to improving the treatment of the mentally ill and promoting mental hygiene. He initially worked hard to appeal to all sectors, and wrote a book in vivid language about his experiences in the asylum, called "A Mind That Found Itself," as publicity. Although many people were moved by him at the time, most people in society coldly discriminated against him. In 1908, he organized the first mental hygiene movement organization in human history, the "Connecticut Society for Mental Hygiene," whose members included only thirteen people, including himself and his father and brothers. The following year, as a result of his active promotion, the National Committee for Mental Hygiene also was established, but only eleven representatives participated. One can imagine how difficult the mental hygiene movement was at that time. However, Beers had an indomitable spirit: he opened the road through thorny bushes, managing bitterly, and his sincerity finally won the sympathy and support of more people. The attitude of people in the community gradually became enlightened, and as a result, the mental hygiene movement not only swept across the United States, but also responded in various countries around the world. In 1918, Canada was the first to establish a formal national organization, followed by Belgium, the United Kingdom, and Brazil. Then Hungary, Germany, Japan, Italy, Argentina, Australia, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Finland, India, New Zealand, France, Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Austria, Denmark, Norway, Sweden and other countries also rose up one after another. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, our country also established the Chinese Association for Mental Hygiene in the capital. Since then, the mental hygiene movement has finally embarked on a splendid and bright road. People all over the world have woken up and are tending to develop sound minds. These great achievements are all due to the efforts of Beers alone, which should be forever remembered by us.</p>
<p>In addition to applying scientific methods to improve the treatment of the mentally ill, the goals of the mental hygiene movement are four points: (1) maintaining mental health; (2) preventing mental illness; (3) disseminating accurate knowledge about mental illness; (4) cooperating with various agencies related to mental hygiene. If the mental hygiene movement can be widely promoted to the public, not only will crime be reduced and social order will be stable, but also education, marriage, family, industry and other aspects will benefit greatly from the improvement of individual psychology, so the mental hygiene movement is really the key to the future happiness of mankind.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the Chinese Association for Mental Hygiene has virtually come to a standstill. Recently, I heard that many Chinese and foreign psychologists and psychiatrists in this port have organized the Shanghai Mental Hygiene Promotion Association, and are preparing to actively promote mental hygiene. They have also established a mental hygiene children's guidance clinic in the Tongren Hospital on Jiujiang Road, which is presided over by psychiatrist Dr. Han Fen. I heard that they will soon open a mental hospital that truly uses scientific methods to treat mental illness, which is undoubtedly a good news worth reporting to readers. I hope that all sectors will give it enthusiastic sympathy and cooperation.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>True Education</h3>
<p>— Mou</p>
<p>I discovered "true education" among twenty-four poorly dressed children. This education made me feel sincerely happy and quietly sigh, "There is still hope!"</p>
<p>I am a second-year university student. Because I am a "university student," I feel the corruption and decline of education even more, because the surrounding atmosphere is so foul that it is hard to believe.</p>
<p>It was a truly accidental opportunity. Two friends started a free night school, and I was also forced to become a teacher. So I became a "teacher" and began to educate. It was truly beyond my expectations that I found the true education that I idealized in these poorly dressed children. Their eyes were wide open.</p>
<p>They listened carefully to me during class, and asked me carefully after class. Their questions often made it impossible for me to answer. However, "teach as an elder, learn as a teacher" became my motto, and I joyfully helped them solve all kinds of difficulties in knowledge. The results of this education are of course very broad, because it is true education and has already reached the efficiency of true education.</p>
<p>However, what about the majority of isolated island students? They live their lives in a drunken stupor, but I believe that "regret" will soon come upon these people, because they have let down "education."</p>
<p>To that group of students who are receiving true education, I bless them: "Success always belongs to you!" But for those confused students, I can only shake my head sadly. I do my best to shout out with a hoarse voice: "Wake up! Seize the opportunity of education!"</p>
<h3>Hitler's Voice</h3>
<p>— Fang Ren</p>
<p>Purdue University in the United States studied Hitler's voice during his speeches. It is said that the sound wave vibration frequency of his representative statements reached as many as 228 times per second, which is eight times more than the wave rate of a normal person when angry, so he can make the audience feel hypnotized. However, when a person speaks like this, his emotions are bound to be too agitated to be controlled by consciousness. The school's research concluded that Hitler was nearly suffering from "hysteria" when giving speeches.</p>
<h3>The Higher Demands of Life (Part 1)</h3>
<p>The Bible story we discuss today tells of a young man encountering a rare experience in the journey of life. Saul's father sent him to find some lost donkeys. While searching, he felt as though he wouldn't find them. Unexpectedly, he met Samuel, a great prophet and a renowned sage. Samuel was concerned about the welfare of the nation, even more so than Saul was about the lost donkeys. He saw Saul as strong, brave, and talented, exactly the kind of excellent young man he was looking for. He believed Saul was more than capable of assisting the king, so he anointed him as the King of Israel. He also discussed various important national issues with him. When Saul returned home, he reported the results to his uncle. Upon hearing that Saul had met the great prophet Samuel, his uncle earnestly asked his son, "Tell me quickly, what did Samuel say to you?" Saul's reply was quite interesting. He said, "The prophet told me that the lost donkeys have been found." Saul made no mention whatsoever of national affairs. Imagine, a young man is anointed as king, and a famous great sage guides him on the principles of governance, telling him that the fate of the nation rests entirely on him. What does he do? He doesn't mention any of it! This encounter couldn't be more important. He is about to become the king of a nation, yet he only tells his uncle about finding the donkeys. Why doesn't he mention it? Some say that in times of crisis, when people are emotionally tense, conversations often avoid serious topics, focusing on things people usually talk about. Perhaps this is why Saul didn't mention the national issues. Maybe his uncle's words were just casual inquiries, without any real meaning, so Saul kept his affairs secret, or at least didn't say anything for the time being. Or perhaps he wanted to contemplate the matter, study everything he had encountered, and analyze his motivations regarding his future destiny. However, I think it's likely that this wasn't Saul's intention. Looking at what he did after being anointed as king, we know that he seemed to have little interest or concern. He clearly said to himself, "National affairs are uncertain, troublesome, and illusory, and nothing can be achieved. I cannot take on such a responsibility. It's better to use my energy to do practical and certain things, rather than worry about various theories day and night." Therefore, he was content with his current life and happy to look for his donkeys. Why bother worrying about national affairs? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>A Machine That Makes People Cry and Laugh</h3>
<p>— Lu Degang</p>
<p>An American physicist recently invented a mysterious machine that can emit special radio waves that make people cry or laugh uncontrollably. It is said that a patent has been obtained, and the machine will soon be installed in theaters. During a comedy performance, the machine will emit happy radio waves, and the audience, upon being touched by the waves, will burst into laughter for hours. Conversely, during a tragedy, only sad radio waves need to be emitted, and the audience will weep bitterly, as if mourning their deceased parents, regardless of how ordinary the plot or how clumsy the actors' skills are, the same effect can be achieved.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is predicted that after this machine is released, the attendance at theaters will be unimaginably high, and the machine will also cause an unprecedented commotion in the theater world!</p>
<h3>Casual Chat About Opera</h3>
<p>— Huiran</p>
<p>When we casually watch a Peking Opera performance in any theater, we are often moved by the play. Why is this? It is because of the actors' dedication and the excellence of the plot that make people watch with enthusiasm and interest. But the most important thing is to give credit to the actors.</p>
<p>Regarding opera actors, most people believe that having a good voice is enough to perform opera. This is indeed true; to perform opera, one must have the so-called "capital." But is performing opera an easy task? I believe that performing opera is one of the most difficult things because it requires considerable training. If someone has never performed opera before, and you ask them to perform, I believe they will not be able to do it steadily. Let's take the current leading actors as an example; which one of them was not trained from a young age? Even those who started performing opera halfway through their lives need to go through considerable training before they can go on stage. Therefore, to perform opera, in addition to having a good voice, one must also have skilled and beautiful gestures and the perseverance to endure hardship.</p>
<p>For example, if there is a famous amateur performer with a very good voice, and their singing is very pleasant, but their gestures are unsightly, then when they go on stage, they can only sing through the entire piece like a wooden figure, and that's it. Would the audience be willing to watch? They might as well just sing a solo in casual clothes, but opera performers cannot do that.</p>
<p>Writing this reminds me of a charity opera performance in Nanjing one year. One amateur performer, because she had not endured the hardship of waist binding, tied her colored trousers very loosely. When she went on stage to sing her signature "Empty City Stratagem," just as she was reciting, "...the Jieting is difficult to defend," as soon as she turned around, her trousers fell down, causing the audience to burst into laughter. This is also because she had not undergone training. In addition, wearing helmets and other things also requires enduring these hardships (even more so for martial arts performers), otherwise, there would be a risk of fainting on the spot.</p>
<p>In short, "performing opera" is definitely not an easy task. To perform opera, one must endure hardship and consider many aspects in order to become a formal opera performer.</p>
<h3>Deanna Durbin's New Film</h3>
<h3>One Generation's Music Saint</h3>
<p>— Qihua</p>
<p>Although this film is titled "One Generation's Music Saint," the entire story unfolds with the "Music Saint" Victor Herbert merely as a supporting character. Victor initially allows Louise to perform on stage, and upon learning that Louise is going to marry John, he happily accepts their invitation. And finally, Victor teaches Peggy. If the screenwriter wanted to write "One Generation's Music Saint," then the above are two very important scenes, but now they are completely overshadowed by Mary Martin and Allan Jones' performances. Therefore, "One Generation's Music Saint" is not writing "Victor Herbert's Great Sequel," but a romance resembling "Peach Blossom Hate."</p>
<p>The film unfolds in flashback from Victor Herbert's birthday party, depicting the meeting of Mary Martin and Allan Jones. The director's concise and vivid technique makes the first half of the film very lively and full of musical atmosphere. The second half, after Louise's reputation overshadows John, Louise takes her daughter to Switzerland to live in seclusion, hoping that John can make a comeback; and John suddenly leaves on the night of Louise's performance, and finally helps Peggy to perform. The director's use of the same technique to handle the tragedy inevitably weakens the second half of the film, and the climax is suddenly rushed and not powerful enough.</p>
<p>Walter Connolly is very good as Victor Herbert, but there is no opportunity for him to develop his acting here. Allan Jones and Mary Martin are also better in the first half of the film than in the second half. Susanna Foster is very good at acting as Peggy, and she is a promising actor.</p>
<h3>Thirty Kinds of Storytelling Songs</h3>
<p>— Written by Dongxue, Illustrated</p>
<p>Prelude</p>
<p>Storytelling songs are a relatively refined form of "folk literature." "Xihe Lyrics" states: "Stories are compiled into rhyming verses, with both dialogue and tunes, which can be sung and played. At the end of the Song Dynasty, there was the Romance of the Western Chamber, which only composed lyrics and tunes, without any dialogue; until the Jin Dynasty, Dong Jieyuan created the Storytelling Song of the Romance of the Western Chamber, with both dialogue and tunes." It can be seen that storytelling songs have a long history and did not originate with Liu Jingting.</p>
<p>The themes of storytelling songs are generally based on the stories of young men and women's joys, sorrows, separations, and reunions, and are connected by human relationships, social customs, and social changes. Many of the storytelling song scripts are excellent works from the pens of knowledgeable people. Children in Jiangnan all love to listen to them, and it is no accident that they have endured for so long.</p>
<p>This article records twenty kinds of storytelling songs, using the "left picture, right history" format to outline each kind of storytelling song. It will be published every Sunday, completing all twenty weeks.</p>
<p>Storytelling songs occupy a relatively important position in the arts. This article does not dare to aim for articles of the nature of textual research, but can only be said to raise some readers' interest in this kind of "folk literature."</p>
