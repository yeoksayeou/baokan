<h3 id="c10">巴爾幹紛爭的檢討 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>義大利進攻希臘，希臘毅然抵抗，於是巴爾幹戰爭爆發了，這是上月二十八日上午五點半鐘的事。兩國軍力懸殊；但是直到今天，自命負有恢復古羅馬帝國光榮傳統的義國黑衫勇士們。還是遠遠地，被攔在他們的目標之外。希義戰爭的最後結果，殆有待世界全局的最後決定：而現在儘可這麼推論的：（一）假如墨索里尼這决發動侵希軍事的戰略目標，是在於急速搶取克利地島，各府，索羅尼加等軍港、藉以威脅央帝國側面，掩護其向近東和非洲進展；則因希臘將士忠勇的自衛而使墨氏的金圖失敗了。因爲希軍抗戰了十天，英國已經獲得充足的時間，先下了手。（二）又假如，德義這次舉動的用意，鑒於空中攻英失敗，而謀挽救其日漸墜落着的威望；亦即謀以向外擴展的新勝利，刺激國內士氣；則希臘以小敵大，而氣燄萬丈，亦正予侵略者以不小的打擊。（三）再假如德義以此爲建設所謂「歐洲新秩序」的試金石，以爲一舉而使希臘屈服後，所有殘存的歐　弱小國家，必爲之股慄，自此相率屈膝於新秩序」之前，現在關於這一打算，亦得了否定的答復；因爲希臘的抵抗，却給予所有不甘爲外力奴隸的國家，以一個最大的指示和鼓勵，使徘徊於自主及臣服兩條歧途的一些國家，如保加利亞，南斯拉夫等國，知所選擇。這是十天來希臘英勇抗戰所已經造就的成果。</p>
<p>試爲窺測前途：第一，檢討兩方軍勢，德國陸軍最高額，大概在八百萬人左右，而最近在匈牙利與捷克交界的地方，以及多腦河流域，德國所集中待機的軍隊，據傳已達百萬左右。意大利的陸軍最高額，據墨索里尼所一再誇稱的也是「入百萬人」；但據一般比較精確的估計，則至多可達六百萬人左右，而現在用來攻希臘的，却據傳僅有兩萬人。在目前西歐並無大規模戰事的情形下，德義如果決定方略，併力東下，則在陸軍方面決非面積十三萬方哩，人口六百三十萬的希臘所能單獨抗拒。所以純從德義與希臘根本國力對比上看，希臘絕對不能長久支持，這是無庸諱言的。其次，十天來的戰事，大致分了三個戰綫進行：（一）在最北端，義軍攻擊根據地是阿爾巴尼亞的高利査，目標是奪取希臘的索羅尼加軍港；在這方面，義軍似乎已經侵入希臘的國境，但照電訉判斷起來，進展是非常之慢。（二）在中部，希臘曾作英勇的反攻，據說已經攻入阿爾巴尼亞的境內，予義軍以相當的損夫。（三）在最南部，義軍進展最大，牠的目標是在希京雅典：目前有劇烈的戰鬥，在喀拉馬斯河上淮行着。此外，義空軍又分頭轟炸希臘各地。根據這十天的戰况，義大利要征服希臘，恐怕還需要相當的時日。不過，我們當然要認淸：眞正大規模的戰爭，一直並沒有開始，德義目下似乎等希臘變計而屈服；一旦妥協絕望，大規模戰爭開始了，則戰况大概不會長此拖延</p>
<p>第二，這一次歐戰之前，所謂「巴爾幹同盟」也者，包含土耳其，南斯拉夫，羅馬尼亞與希臘等四國。牠們可以出動的兵員，大概可以達到六百萬人；直到大戰爆發前夜，除掉南斯拉夫已經動搖外，其餘土耳其與英國間，訂了互助協定，希羅兩國都從英國受到安全的保證。實際上，英國是希望戰爭一開始，在這一帶就可形成一個堅强陣綫，對德開始戰爭；可是英國這一計劃。終於爲了三個因素而失敗了：（一）英羅當時交涉的失敗，羅馬尼亞拒絕參加援助波蘭。（二）蘇聯反對土耳其爲英法利益而參加歐戰。（三）義大利的不即行參戰，鎭住了這一帶對德任何敵對行動的醞釀。及至今年六月，法國崩潰後，羅馬尼亞也就被德義控制了。現在假如希臘相繼屈服，則南斯拉夫的投入德義懷抱，乃爲勢所必然；至於素來傾向軸心國家的保加利亞，不用說，不免要蹈匈牙利的後塵，而成爲德義東進的急先鋒。所以從英國方面講，希臘的抵抗，至少給予英國以一個騰挪的機會，使德義暫時不能完成牠們把整個巴爾幹（除土耳其外）編入自己戰事機構的企圖；亦即希臘已給英國爭取巴爾幹各國友誼與助力的一個最後機會。此後問題的癥結，乃爲英國是否還能爭取巴爾幹各國的友誼，組成堅强陣綫，以對抗德義的東下？</p>
<p>這一嚴重問題的答案，並非必能的，却是可能的。蓋有兩點可徵；第一，英國這次決心的堅强，援希的迅速而切實；第二，是巴爾幹各國這幾天來態度的逐漸轉變。過去「巴爾幹同盟」的瓦解，大半應當歸咎於英國首鼠兩端的綏靖政策。試問在德義壓力之下，弱小國家沒有可信可恃的外援，則除了投降苟安外，實在也沒有他途。到了現在、據英國海相亞力山大宣稱，英國確實已經爲牠帝國近東非洲部份的最後外圍，作重大的努力，軍隊正在向希臘輸送之中、這所予弱小各國的印象，夠興奮而安慰。在這個鼓勵之下，他們一面看到阿爾巴尼亞，一面又看以希臘，存亡殊途，榮辱異觀，將使土耳其，南斯拉夫，以及他國，如果稍有可能，必定會爲自己的生存，攘臂奮鬥。總之，十天前的銷沉氣象，現在顯然已見振作，而土耳其並且已經召集大批的後備兵了。趨勢若斯而大勢未決，英國終於能否達到重行取得巴爾幹各國友誼，挽回整個局勢的最大關鍵，決非外交與口惠所克濟事，還在英國證明其艱苦與共的抱負，發爲劍及屨及的行動！</p>

<p>人造雌雄說到男子身體的必要保養</p>
<p>近代的科學眞是突飛猛進，幾乎任何困難的問題，都可由科學來解決。關於自然科學方面偉大的成就，我們果然罄竹難書，就拿生理學方面的人體生殖腺一項的研究，也就足夠驚人了！斯丹那氏竭其畢生經騐，對於人體生殖腺作艱辛實騐，結果，完成其用動物之生殖腺素來補給於人體，收却病延年返老還童之效，於是震驚了世界之醫壇，造福於人類之健康，其豐功偉績，實可與日月同輝。可是關於生殖腺的研究，近復有人工可造雌雄的偉大的成就。據美國浦克得Wi-liam　O.Puckett博士在美國動物學會表演他的人造雌雄法，他把極幼稚喧蛙的蝌蚪，解剖其生殖腺供眾細察，指示蝌蚪在這暑期的雌雄尙未分判，它們的分判期常在蝌蚪之末期，此時若把雌內分泌或雄內分泌，（生殖腺液）和喧蛙及殻後一個小器官內的黏液腺共同注入，則受雌內分泌的蝌蚪即變成雌性，而受雄內分泌的即成為雄性。博士屢作試騐，可以任意使它成為雌或成為雄。由這試騐的成功，就不難推廣應用於人類。誠然，一對男女結婚以後，在夫婦生活中的生男育女，與性能健康大有關係，一個精力充沛的健壯丈夫，在新婚之後，每一索得男，此外男子對於生殖腺液用種種衛生方法加保養，使之充沛，亦每可以生男，所謂清心寡慾多男子，實亦有至理！不過，男子如果於早年犯有自瀆遺精，或婚後荒淫縱慾，致精關失司，性神經衰弱，爆發着滑精漏精，精力渙散，腦腎虧損，健忘失眠等症，則在夫婦生活中每無法圓滿，如此，不特難以生子，即夫婦關係，恐亦難以保持，因此在家庭中每發生種種的悲劇，或竟振振有詞與夫訴請離婚者，在今日社會上亦為常有的事。至在男子的本身，旣因身體衰弱，復受此種悲慘，更何以塨！因內心上之痛苦，致病勢加劇，成未老先衰，或一病嗚呼早年殀殤者，亦是多不勝計，其危險為何似！關於治療方法。雖有多端，但據世界名醫及余多年經騐，均公認以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為對症而特效。誠以此劑於服每一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，男子精力充沛，夫婦愛情因以深厚。生男育女可有把握，若能繼續服用，則不特可將男子的各種性痛，完全治愈，并可收延年益壽返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，制止遺洩，收效尤逸！若患者能來本診所就專家醫師診斷後施用電療，注射，手術等科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<p>在這紛亂的時代，到處是十字街頭，無世故經騐的青年，徬徨歧途，眞是危機四伏。誘惑青年人力量最大的，莫如妖冶的女人和自身性的刺激，因為青年人是正當情竇初開性的好奇心萬分強烈，此時如沒有良好的敎育和正確的指導，鮮有不為不良環境所引誘，墮入汚泥深淵中。卽以青年人犯得最普遍而又為社會人士漠然視之的自凟與遺精而論，其弊害的嚴重，將尤甚於洪水猛獸！第一，青年人之犯自凟者，幾至多不可勝計，直接受害者，為其自身性神經的摧殘，致精關失司，射精神經過敏，而繼起遺精。遺精一起，卽等於有了滑巵，體內精必有多量的流失，是以人體各部均呈枯耗狀態，各種虛弱症象，如腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎虧無能，卽相繼而來，其個人健康與幸福的前途，卽猶處在昏夜的黑暗中。第二，因對於性機能的斵傷，其婚後必不能營兩性的圓滿生活，因此，妻子的青年蹉跎，幸福斷送，直猶如把妻子送入痛苦的墳墓中。同時，他自身人生所應有幸福呢？也不知將拋送在五里霧中或九霄雲外去了。第三，青年自幼而少，自少而至青年，其父母兄姊師長，以及社國國家所子的負担與培植，必不在少數，以家庭言則滿望其成家立業榮宗耀祖，以社會國家言，則滿望其能成一個建設上的技師，戰塲上的忠勇將士，俾在抗戰建國的途程中獲得一個能員。然而事實上能否適應這種要求？據我們所知道，大多數的青年均沉淪在低級興趣的自凟與淫樂中而不能自拔，能不浩嘆！自覺的青年呀！當此千載一時，人奴的關頭，我們必須要用最大的決心來戒絕我們自凟與淫樂，并服最特效的良藥「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，解除射精經過敏狀態而根本的治療遺精。如因遺精已引起上述症狀者，尤須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦腎，增益精血，則必可於短期內完全恢復健康。</p>

<p>高聳而有彈性的乳峯是健美女性的靈魂</p>
<p>高高的一對乳峯，襯著婀娜的身材，與豐腴的臀部，再加上一張白晳而紅潤的臉，和著柳眉櫻脣，見齒瓊鼻，這樣健閏的女性，不但在家庭里為丈夫尊若天人，兩性間卿卿我我，愛情特別來得濃厚，即到社會上去交際，憑她這個模樣兒，也是到處似眾星之捧月，受人熱烈歡迎。</p>
<p>但是這樣的健美女性，世界上究竟還是少數，唯一的主要原因，因為女性要達到上述的那麼健美，全伏卵巢機能的充分健全，卵巢機能健全，那麼女性的特徵，卽有良好的發育，最顯著者，就是乳部呈堅實而有彈性的峯狀聳起，卽使穿了緊窄的衣服，它也不肯就範那麼地突出胸前，雙峯對峙，空谷幽深，這是多麼引人心醉，同時臀部亦必相當發達，加以活潑的柳腰，就形成女性最神秘而可愛的全部曲線，然此數者，祇有發育良好的女性方克享受，他如早年耽弱自凟，或因月經不調，白帶不感，病後虧弱，以致卵巢機能　下去所厭惡，生育維艱，卽於個人的性情方面，亦多固執偏狹，善感多愁，快樂幸福之神，與她無緣，因此好前途命運的悲慘！也就不堪設想了！欲謀祈求，祇有憑藉科學，據世界婦科名醫Oansnasr康斯南氏等及余經難，均公認服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」最為對症而特半後外，因此藥於服後卽能培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，如繼續服用，担保於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，而使乳峯逐漸聳起，化醜為嬌艷。</p>

<p>英后見着我對我說：「莫樂先生，我對巴黎的命運，極感悲哀。我對於貴國人民的不幸，深表同情。我非常的愛着法國。兩年前我們聘問巴黎時，我和貴國婦女心心相印，今晚擬在無綫電中同她們傾談一切，一吐胸中眞情。」</p>
<p>她旋與我討論廣播的措辭，又問我妻兒的下落，辭意懇摯。我答稱他們消息杳然，她一雙柔和的眼睛，表示着無限的同情，竟至泫然欲涕，使我大爲感動。當她說「我深愛法國時，我感覺着這並不是官塲客套話，而是出於眞心。皇后和英國人民一樣，原想盡力帮助法國，可是太晚了。</p>
<p>巴黎旣告失陷，邱吉爾便飛往都爾，當時法國巳呈土崩瓦解之象，使他驚惊不已。他着陸的飛機塲中，竟是閱無一人：沒有一個政府官吏，也沒有一個代表，前來迎接。城中難民充斥，他費了許多周折，纔尋到法國政府的所在。</p>
<p>洛亞河畔一所別墅中，法國總理萊諾告訴他說，他仍堅持作戰到底，但他或者不得不出於辭職的一途，繼仟內閣或須要求停戰。果爾則英國態度怎樣呢？邱吉爾聲明不能解除法國不能單獨媾和的的束。這便是萊諾和邱吉爾兩巨頭最後一次會面。</p>
<p>六月二十七日，我到威爾晚去見英國前任駐法大使費普斯爵士，他邀我共聽法國廣播。無緩電中唱着「市民們，起來從軍去！」的作戰口號，我不禁欷歡流涕。我旋得悉萊諾已經去聯，新政府已經請求休戰。我相信我的英國朋友，在這决彼此均感痛苦的環境之下，他們休休有容的態度，確與他們高貴的傳統精神相吻合。他們立刻認識這一幕悲劇中雙方都有錯誤，母庸彼此責難。陸軍部决官葛立格爵士曾對我道：</p>
<p>「我所要告訴你的，就是我們了解一切，不來責備你們。我們小能及時援助你們。你們除此以外，也是別無他法」</p>
<p>他接着同我談起法國艦隊的事。這是所有英國人都感到煩惱小安的。此後數日中空氣益覺險惡。停戰條件引起嚴重的驚慌。據說英闖駐法大使康倍爾爵士在波爾多，已不復能獲得仟何消息。法國駐英大使考平，因爲不顧代表與平素主張相反的政府，也已提出辭呈了。</p>
<p>在最後一刻，邱吉爾仍想慫恿萊諾內閣繼續作戰，主張將英法兩大國合併，歸由一個政府管轄，主席則由法國人充任。彼此人民都有火法兩重國籍。一切財當物資歸兩國公有。這一個驚人的建議，若早幾星期提出，必能改變戰局。可惜那時候法國已是精疲力竭，除了「立卽」助以飛機，戰車，大砲面外，已是一無听求了。</p>

<p>魏剛將軍道：「假如在那時候，火車中有人對邱吉爾說：「反抗他們—我家中資財充足，可以任你取用，」這種建議當然不能挽回情勢。現在法國的處境正復相同，只好同邱吉爾一樣「聽天山命，」而已</p>
<p>這事虛實如何，作者不得而知，但他的比擬可許十分恰當。但在邱吉爾方面，自以爲他的建議對於法國　獻至大，甚至國會震惊，人民惶惑，怪他作事過分，而今見到對方不啾不睬的態度，自難免有創鉅痛深之感了。許多英國人也都和他同抱遺憾，尤以最愛法國的友人痛苦更桀。</p>
<p>英國政論家麥卡　會對我說：慚愧得很！我倒很高興做法國公民呢！</p>
<p>我與他和另一位天才作家毛鐵墨在漫漫長夜中，縱論今古，稍遺愁懷。麥氏的言語，尤爲扼耍。</p>
<p>他說：「第一，我們英國人不可忘却我們的友人，和他們的隆情厚誼。卽使我們天涯海角，多年不通音問，卽使法國人　說央國人都是怪物，英國人聽說法國人中途背棄，我們仍須記住，有好些法國人，也有好些英國人，都有胸襟高尚，忠恕爲懷的。我們一有機會，就應當相親相愛，比平時更要親愛十倍，世界上的親愛精誠正患缺乏，我們必須加以補救。」</p>
<p>當晚情景以及我在許多友人家中的所見所聞，使我腦海中對於英國，重現較好的印象。可是環境困難，使我痛苦萬分。兩國關係，愈趨嚴重。法國坦克車專家特戈爾將軍已在倫敦組織法蘭西民族委員會，招寡志願兵，引起了許多法國人的良心問題。有些人認爲在國家危難之時，不應從事分裂運動。有些人則不願承認停戰條的，而投向特戈爾將軍麾下。</p>
<p>倫敦與波爾多間，且已在無錢電中互相攻訐，此種無謂的爭論，使我深爲痛心。我雖主張適可而止，但無絲亳效力。</p>
<p>那時英國祇有如何充實國防一個念頭。在五月間，英國還沒有配備完整的軍隊可以派往法國，到了七月，已有百萬大軍訓練精熟，可以執戈衛國，抵抗强敵了。加拿人軍和淡大利軍也將第一次在英國本土作戰了。各處要這和城市，防禦陣地所在皆是。總司令部已因法國所受慘痛的經騐，獲得教訓，飾令民衆在被攻擊時鱉居家中，不得外出，以免妨碍軍事行動。各村都招募義勇隊，以防禦敵方傘兵。一種果敢的精神，和奮發的勇氣，到處可見，且爲從來所未有。英國突然發覺法國並不能倚作長城之靠，因而受到劇烈的震動，惴惴於三島的安全問題。但當危險臨頭之際，英國民族　不畏怯退縮，反而勇氣倍增，一如往昔歷史中所表現的一般。</p>
<p>七月二日法國軍事聯絡團將我解除職務。自此以後，一因英法兩國之間，交通斷絕，一因我允在哈佛大學担任講演，便決計離英赴美。橫渡大西洋時所乘的船卽是英國遺送兒童至加拿大的一經。當時在甲板上所見的情形，使人非常感動。一千個兒童，在日光之下，圍繞着保護他們的大砲游戲。護送艦隻，有巡洋艦一艘和驅逐艦兩艘。我在船上，從所貼報告中得到奧蘭戰事（按卽英艦隊攻擊法屬菲洲奧闌港法國艦隊的一役）的驚人消息。數星期來追隨着我的種種不幸，當以這一件事爲最可恐怖了。我雖生爲法國人，但和央國己有二十年的交誼。我現在正如一個父母已宣告離婚的孩子，縱和母親同居，痛苦亦自可想而知。我心裹說：「無論或是或非我終愛我的國家。」我的理智告訴我，這亟需互助的兩國民族，有此決裂，實是一椿極大的憾事呀。我倚攔眺望，但見海水洵湧，巡洋艦傍船行馳駛。英國船副，見我憂思甚深，擦身行過，亦悄然無語。此時我陡然想起麥卡賽的話，「無論我們的遭遇怎樣，切勿忘却我們的友誼依然不變。我不自覺的低唱着蘇格蘭歌「假使舊日的相識忘懷了……」在巡洋艦的砲塔上一燈高懸，但見光芒閃爍，正向我們傳遞着神秘的信息。（完）</p>

<p>廠布昨市以謠言平息、囤戶又起活動、客帮及同業亦乘廉吸收、交易驟盛、各布售盤一致回漲、漂染布漲二角半至五角、粗布漲一角至二角半、細布斜紋漲二角半至五角、富貴細布增至三十二元五角、細斜三十一元、本街成交八百餘件、囤戶吸額較巨、浙閩帮辦藍布綫呢色斜等三百餘件、粵港帮辦色布色斜一百餘件、國外新加坡等地辦色布漂布斜紋等六千餘疋、今日有疋頭六百六十七件運香港、一百八十件運新加坡、七件運庇能、</p>
<p>東布狂升疾降、起伏甚鉅、結果細布漲每疋七角半至一元、細斜提升五角、嗶嘰漲每碼三分、晨市龍頭細布自三十四元六七角起直升至三十五元四角、收盤後市開盤在跳、見三十六元、四君子嗶嘰高峯到一元一角一分、惟不旋踵謠言蠶起、獲利吐售、跌勢亦猛、龍頭降至三十五元三角半、嗶嘰一元〇八分、而同業人心則以實銷良好、多數看漲、</p>

<p>咋呢羢市面仍佳、交易旺盛、標準穩固堅挺、單面高條花呢、扔頗風行全滬、中裝長衫袍料、西裝套頭衣料、均皆盛銷、藏靑與元靑二色，銷路較更暢活、駝色市銷略呆、花樣有闊條狹條·細條·二三條·二三條·一三條·二三條等各有需要、本廠貨祇永興·宏康有出品、頭號每碼批沽二十五六元、副號二十元、普通二十一二元、英製品普通齋售三十七八元、</p>
<h3 id="c62">糧食　民食眞是多災多難　仍傳將來洋米艙位不足　未漲先漲終是奸商搗亂 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>洋米陸續來滬、太古公司濟南輪昨晨抵滬、由香港裝來洋米一千五百二十二、停靠法租界外灘本行碼頭起卸、怡和洋行利生輪、亦由香港運來二百包、同於昨晨到埠、停靠　斯福碼頭起卸、（祖）</p>
<p>洋米昨市又見飛黃騰達，期現各貨一致上升、然其致漲原因、並非有意外消化與產價高漲、祇以邇日船位不足、定貨减少而已、至於定價依然通劃、人心巳被帶好、投機帮與浮多散囤莫不乘勢活躍、貨主亦趁　扳守、故早市開價步步上升午市巳比前日漲起近元、午後買氣更濃、貨主堅守甚力、價乃再大元許、結果現米比前日大起二元之譜、新交易未妥、回籠二號西貢開市喊七十三元、旋自七十三元半至七十三元八角、午後更見　秀、某方售出五百噸、價乃昂達七十四元半、比前日亦漲起一元七角至二元不等矣、全日現貨成交亦有萬包以上、回籠原包總計八百噸、計一號西貢六十六元半六十六元、二號六十一元七角、六十一元一角、火絞六十四元半、决至六十一元八角、二號暹邏六十元零五角、六十元、小紋六十元零七角、五十九元五角、東京　尖五十五元、碎尖五十一元二角、五十元、米菉五十西元一角、五十四元、蕪湖尖五十九元四角、五十九元、</p>
<p>新粳尖及茶　野稻等共到一千餘石、其中新粳則寥寥無幾、而銷塲獨廣、致一時有不敷分配之概、價提一二元不等、原包特別開八十一二元至八十元、次七十六元、斛見七十七元、七十四五元、菉種野稻不過平平、開野稻八十元零五角八十元、菉種七十七元半、七十六元、杜洋尖亦乏榮辱、杜尖原包特七十二元、羊尖六十七元、糯米去路復懈、並屬定局云云、</p>

<p>麵粉　昨日現粉市况平淡如恒、查華粉廠盤屹立未動、兩廠批出八千餘包、頗足本街需用、回籠貨老車粉以籌碼不多、本胃早淡、是以供求兩寂、毫無成議、洋粉續居擯持狀態、據洋行消息、此决所定洋粉、大致旬日後可到、爲日無幾、人心惴惴不安、投機買賣、更鮮挿足其間、聞本街購進雙鷹牌洋粉二百包、價爲十八元五角、與華粉客盤相仿、昨有麵粉二百包由香港來、</p>
<p>小麥　咋到稀銷淡、市面亳無精采、查日廠方面、自奉命禁運租界後、鳳凰粉產量頓見减少、故原料需要、亦不貪取、除送廠貨、限定作價、每日收進百數十包外、並不在市收買、華廠及其他銷戶、吏屬乏貨可收、是以交易日見沉靜云、</p>

<p>十月份紐約生絲進销均有進步，計進口增加一七、三三六擔、內上海絲僅增二五〇擔、日絲則增加一七、三三六擔、此點可證美國禁止日絲進口云云、顯屬無聊、是故十月絲價亦頗振作、按是月橫濱曾漲至一五〇〇元、惟下半月卽不支下落、十月份紐約生絲消用增加二〇四九擔、蓋時令關係所致也、</p>

<h3 id="c71">上海美僑一致　愛戴羅斯福聯任　因援助中國獲無限同情　總統標準惟求能勝任者 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>當昨　美國國內五千萬公民投票選舉總統之時、本埠美僑舉行假想的投票、百分之九十以上，　贊成羅斯福繼續仟爲白宮之主人、今日上海美僑對羅斯福廣大之擁護、適與一九三六年完全相反、當時美僑百分之九十以上、均擁護蘭登、而期望其成爲第二任總統、據某關心政治之著名美僑昨日稱、在此短短四年中、熱烈之擁護、已由一政黨而移至另一政黨、世界各地之美僑、其變遜之速、從未有如上海之美僑者、</p>
<p>駕輕就熟　永孚衆望</p>
<p>據稱、本埠美僑所以傾向民主黨者、乃因目下歐亞兩洲均在進行戰爭、總統之人選、已不以政黨爲標準、而惟求最能勝仟其職者、羅斯福在白宮中已有八年之經騐、不但能駕輕就熟、而且其令人尊敬之外交術、亦足使其爲最合格之總統當選人、蓋大多數美人、均深信此後之四年、爲美國歷史中最困難之時期也、</p>
<p>未來新政　適合國情</p>
<p>渠又指出羅斯福的新政、並非法西斯主義、由於過去四年歷史之經騐、人民已開始覺悟、美國未來之政策、與國內計劃、決不能再以「個人主義」爲口號、彼等明瞭某種社會事業、非由政府統治不可、而權勢·物質·與人力、必須有更好之支配、而新政之目的、卽在於此云、上海美僑對於此次總統選舉、打賭者較少蓋無人下威爾基之注、多深信羅斯福必獲連任、彼等並指出卽使在華爾街亦決以八對五下羅斯福之注也、自美海軍中之瓊斯、至按察使海爾密克、皆表示「羅斯福將無往不利」</p>
<p>滬僑大部　擁護羅氏</p>
<p>大陸報云、昨（四日）夜記者向本市美僑徵詢意見所悉、美國四十八州今日（五日）舉行總統大選、羅斯福與威爾基兩候選總統劇烈競爭、旅居上海之美僑、若能參加選舉、則羅斯福所得連任三屆總統之贊成票、必將大增、估計上海美僑贊成羅斯福者、的佔百分之七十五、已往數月來、本市美僑之轉向威爾基者、寥寥無幾、惟擁護羅總統者、承認美國境內民衆原擬投票選舉羅斯福、而於近數星期來轉向威爾基者、亦不乏人、</p>
<p>援助中國　深得人心</p>
<p>據美僑各界觀察家指稱、威爾基雖保證對於遠東、賡續實行現政府之政策、然此仍屬保證未見諸事實、羅斯福總統則確已採取步驟、手揮「巨棒」、援助重慶、以緩和中國大局、並遏止日本之侵略、在表面上、美僑對於國務院之撤僑計劃、頗多騷動、但除略有不平之言外、遠東美僑對羅斯福之熊度、所受影響甚微、蓋美僑觀於大局嚴重而認撤僑爲向正當方面進行之一種步驟也、</p>
<p>預測結果　四與一比</p>
<p>亦有視撤僑勸吿純爲共和黨競選運動之巧妙手段者、究屬少數、昨夜美僑頗有以金錢打賭競選結果者、深信羅斯福必能當選之共和黨美僑、甚至以四對一賭羅總統獲勝、但以多對少賭威爾基必勝者、並無其人、聞所賭金額不巨、</p>

<p>又一血案</p>
<p>虹口狄思威路東洋街二二二號日本人高橋常太郎家、於前晚十二時許、有手持銳利刀斧之四五人、由其樓上窗口侵入、用利器將其夫婦一人、在胸腹部連斫數十處之多、當塲身死、以樓板上鮮血淋漓、滴漏而下、並將其家內所有貴金屬及金債券、悉數攫取而逸、家中尚有揚州女傭一人、當時熟睡未醒、迨至淸晨起身、感滿屋血腥、上樓驚見其主人已雙變飮刃、倒臥血泊中、急行奔出呼喊、一時鄰近居戶始紛紛　集、</p>

<p>春秋	救救孩子  露露　　在黑暗的夜裹，我走到一條怕走又不能不走的道路時，眼睛總那末睜大地俯望脚下：我害怕，倘若天上沒有月亮，沒有星星，那條街是非常幽黯，祇有遙遠的路燈纔依稀地透出萎黃的微光來。　　驀然，在角落裏，會現出着蒲包，或楚破蓆，裹面呢，裹着血淋淋的嬰屍，那一雙瘦弱的小脚，有時會露出外面來；每天這樣的，在一條街上會發現好幾决。　　在我眼前，往往展開來一慕都會的慘劇——嬰兒殺戮；當窮苦人家裹生出着一個嬰孩時，家裏的氛圍，沒有歡樂，倒是籠遮着陰森森的黑影。在米貴得如同珍珠一般的都會之中，多了一條性命就多一張嘴，非單嬰兒生長後得哺飯，並且累得做媽媽的，不再出去勞作。於是，可憐的，這小小的新生命，剛脫離了母胎，就巡殺害。　　在半年前，也曾到過育嬰堂去過，當到那潮濕陰暗的房間去、悽慘的，在一間裏，安頓了幾十個嬰孩，嬰兒的面色是萎黃的，身體是瘦弱的，一惆乳媽媽哺十幾惆孩子，嬰兒們那得不餓呢！　　在日前，在弄堂裏又發生一樁悲劇：弄裹的丐婦生養了一個嬰兒，當這纔出世嬰兒底母親出外求乞　來，發覺嬰孩不見了，哭着，喊着，都沒有孩子的影踪，過了幾天，欃從垃圾筒裏找到，可是身子和頭顱已經分離了，原來一個「花會」癮的人偷偷盜去求夢。想不到這迷信這賭博累了一條孩子的性命，更想不到在現社會中，還會發生這樣愚蠢殘酷的慘事！……　　現在又將近冬天了，當富家的孩子，穿着溫暖幾十塊錢一套的羊毛杉的時候，窮苦孩子的慘涌，不是在每個角落裏都現出麽？在寒風中顫慄的，在飯店前貪饞挨俄的，跪着求乞的，索索在寒夜中抖擻的，　　看到窮苦孩子的不幸，不禁迫出了「救救孩子」的呼聲。尋狗賣兒  金呑作記王培孫先生  黃康屯　　上海有個不聲不響實事求是的老教育家，那便是辦了四十年南洋中學的王培孫先生。　　他平生辦學最不愛表面文章，表格簿冊之類，在他的辦公室裹是我不到的。愛實際而不愛形式，期實效而小規規於功令；行我心之所安而不喜隨人脚跟。談風甚健而不愛演說；公衆集會雖得參加。他從沒有長篇的布告，他對學生的條告，都極簡單而明白。寫過的信封，紅紅錄絲的請柬賀年片之類的反面，都是他出條告寫便札的絕好箋料。他不大喜歡會議，處理校務，一向用的是納粹式，教務訓育人員不過是他的高等顧問；他似乎偏尚人治而不大注意法治。戰後學校遷在租界，他已不常到校，也就採用了內閣制了。　　他壯歲時右目失明，成了獨眼龍。鼻上架個眼鏡，看起書報來，居然一目十行。他是個連邊鬍髭，却不愛蓄鬚，瘦得和甘地一樣，却常年廣强少病。篤好佛法，却並不完全茹素。心腸極柔，似乎雷於中庸的妥洽性，容易給婦人小子的眼淚所軟化；答允了人家的請求，便幫忙到底，甚至不惜從井救人。但劉事却胸有成竹，不輕轉移，你以爲他執拗，他却母固母我，有時令人不可捉摸。　　他已經　居了一十多年，沒有親生的兒女；他把學生看作自己的兒女。他最憐貧苦央學的靑年。南洋中學的免費生，一面耍占到全校學生數額的十分之三以上。別個私立學校多能賺錢，南洋中學却尚有校債。　　他愛學生，也愛各種動物。在日暉橋時，他在校裹及所住的寓裹，養鴨，養鷄，養鵝，養羊，養貓，養白老蟲，……他養的貓，不許他捕鼠；貓也居然跟他有了佛性。老蟲有時會攢到他的被窩裹米，却並不加以驅除。戰前他養着一隻猴子，每天抱着乘了包車由他的寓所帶到學校，晚上又帶回寓所，成了異類的良伴。曾經合照過一張相片，非常發噱。直至八一三戰時避難常州，不及携帶，這隻猢猻竟死於國難，後來還時常追念小置。他雖厭惡殺生，不過在無可奈何時，他也並不戒殺。他最愛羊，會經得到一頭黃羊，把牠蕃殖了數代，視爲珍畜。　　他不喜書書，雖是名家送給他的書甚，他都隨手送與別人，甚至棄之紙麓，連梁仟公親筆寫了贈他的對聯，也不在例外。只有搜集志乘，成了他生平唯一的雅與。南洋中學圖書備彷彿成了全國各省府廳州縣志書的收藏所。其中不乏海內孤本，雖在屢次的顚沛流離中，那大批的志書也還安然無恙。在文化上也許將來便是他畢生最大的遺產。　　他愛聽經，愛與僧侶結緣，尚友明淸之際的高僧。蒼雪詩僧所留下的殘缺不完的南來堂集，經他長期的搜集校訂，竟成了完璧，集貲付梓，做了他七十生日的紀念作品。　　今年農曆的十月十日，是他老人家的七十生辰。他是一向不喜歡人家替他做壽的，他自己看自己，還是當着孩子。的確，他是個不失其赤子之心的老孩子。他的思想也還是個迎頭趕上去的靑年思想。他愛看緩裝書，但也極愛看新書。不久之前，我偶然看他，他正在看「西行漫記」，看得十分起緊。你以爲他是七十歲的老頭兒嗎？霍桑探案舞后的歸宿  程小靑著　　第十章　皮革問題　　我們三惆人離開警廳的時候，時間已是下午五點半鐘。淡淡的陽光已漸漸兒向西，有好幾惆賣報童子，都在高着喉嚨亂喊：「交祭花吹手槍」，舞國皇后到陰間」一類俏皮的名目。我隨手買了一張，方才上車。汽車進行時，我急忙把報紙翻開，找尋關於王麗蘭的這一節新聞。那「舞后被暗殺」的標題字模雖很大，但新聞的內容却簡單得很。內中祗記載王麗蘭在半夜後被人刺死，不但嫌疑人不會例舉，連手槍的字樣都沒有。此外祇鋪張些王麗蘭當選舞后時的許多已往事實，和伊在舞塲裹的那些傾倒一時的軼聞，還有伊的住所和平日的生活狀况。末段的結論，却把倪金壽亂捧一陣、連霍桑和我的名字都不曾提起。　　霍桑一壁把握着司機盤，一壁淡淡地問我說：「報紙上寫些什麽？」　　我答道：「雷聲饗，雨點小，簡直不曾說什麽——這新聞好像經過什麽人統制或筆削過的，幸虧你和我的名字都不會牽連進去。」　　霍桑不答，也不加什麽批評。倪金壽不但不關心報紙上的新聞，連霍桑跟我的問答也並不注意。他分明十二分緊張，好像他的精神完全集中在如何應付趙伯雄的問題上。其實我對於他也有相當的同情。因爲這趙伯雄旣然有着某種來歷，確乎不能同平常的罪犯一般看待。霍桑是不受官俸的人，當然還少顧忌；倪金壽因着他的直屬上司的袒護，情形不同，確有些左右爲難。霍桑可打算再拘捕趙伯雄嗎，眼前他旣然有了戒備，可會用武力抵抗嗎？料想起來，這個人定有不少羽黨，那末，這一次我們三個人可敵得住嗎？　　汽車到了黃河路轉角，霍桑馬上停軍，隨卽跳下車來。倪金壽和我也跟着下來。他右手揷在衣袋中，分明已把握着手槍。他的眼睛小住向左右瞭望。我受了他的暗示，也準備好衣袋中的手槍。但霍桑却並無緊張狀態。　　倪金壽用左手同前而指一指。「那不是豐泰烟紙店嗎？」這時我也瞧見了那是一爿一間門面的小烟紙店。　　霍桑應道：「是的，怎麽不見荷生？」　　倪金壽道：「奇怪，他到那裏去了？他說他在這裏附近等我們。」　　霍桑說：「也許趙伯雄又走了，荷生也跟着他去。」　　「那怎麽辦？我們能不能到這紉紙店裹去搜　搜？」　　「這不妥。我們姑月到店裏去看一看再說。」　（一六六）　　影星猜獎每日一星　　猜中者請投函本公司門市部即得我貴贈品（請簽字蓋章）　　九日截止　十三揭曉　　她是在十年前初上鏡頭，現在還享着盛名，猜一下看，她倒底是誰？</p>

<p>㳺藝界廣播與荒播  耳觀　　廣播是「近代文明的一種傳　思想的工具」，但在今日孤島上的廣播，則無疑地已成了「竭力傾向於無聊和卑下的揚聲筒」，使人感到這不是廣播，簡直是荒播，是集合着荒淫，荒謬，荒唐的廣播。　　記得本欄前載聽播偶感」一文，會很剴切地指出這些荒播的謬誤，然而言者諄諄，聽者藐藐，最近的收音機中，竟有人普遍地在介紹公開叭食「戒烟膏」，「戒烟膏」可以代替鴉片，原不過是五十步與百步之別，但依舊可以「用槍呼」，「用燈燃」，而且「色香味三者倶備」，卽使用以爲「應酬賓朋的消遺品」，亦令人有「一槍在手」的」妙感一，那倘使不是做廣告者的過甚其詞，給這一種「戒烟膏」播送廣告的播音藝員，實在也太淋漓盡致了！　　同樣的，節目旣充盈了牛鬼蛇神，於日爲聽衆所設想的消遺方法，除了吸吸「戒烟膏」之外，則有「最新出品」的「靈乩圖」，「能知過去未來」，「能卜富貴窮通」，似乎「金融動盪」，「滙市緊鬆」，「物價漲落」，也不難由此得到判斷，在播音藝員極盡發揮　妙用之下，顯然的也快將普徧流行！但在另一方面呢，一個評話家會　「聞鷄起舞」這一句頗有旁徵博引使人憬悟可能的話，說是「初非所知」，甚至於無法解釋！　　類乎這些收聽即是的荒播，我敢斗胆說一句，是充盈在每一架收音機中的，我們固然並不期望今日孤島上的廣播，可以「擴展聽衆的視界」，「充實聽衆的智識」，作算廣播是游藝之一，但「鼓勵聽衆們的墮落」，使廣播成了荒播，也未始不是有乖游藝之旨的。在這裹，筆者還是借用君美君在聽播偶感一文中的話，希望播音藝員別認爲是攻擊，而「有則改之，無則加勉」，或者竭力避免，甚至斷然拒絕纔行。同劇異名錄（四）  語初　　一箭仇—又名「會頭市」或「英雄義」。劇中因述及史文恭在水中被梁山衆英雄所擒事，故亦名「水擒史文恭」。　　梅龍鎮—亦稱「遊龍戲鳳」。演全部名「驪珠夢」。　　應天球—述晋太守王濬智除蛟虎及周處三害之故事，遂又名「除三害」。　　胭粉計—又名「葫蘆峪」　　戰蒲關—亦名「殺妾犒軍」，更有「吃人肉」一名，惟此名過於粗俗，故用者甚少，尚有「忠節義」一名，亦不當用　　臥虎山—又稱「臥虎關」或伍子胥馬前認子」及「父子會」二名。（按「白良關」一劇，亦可稱「父子會」。）　　取榮陽—名「焚紀信」或「楚漢爭」。　　紅拂傳—記紅拂女子及李靖，虬髯客三人俠義事，故又名「風塵三俠」。　　鐵蓮花—又名「掃雪打碗」，演全部稱「生死板」。　　會稽　—亦名「元帥帶馬」。內述揚州名妓石中玉臨陣擒寇之事。亦稱「妓女擒寇」或「胭脂虎」。　　巧連環—又名一時遷偷鷄」，爲「全部石十回」中緊接翠屏山」後之一折，尚有「盜皇墳」一劇，可名「時遷盜墳」。　　打漁殺家—亦名一慶頂珠」，若貼演開塲戲時名「討魚稅」。　　取洛陽—可名「馬武爭功」亦有稱「岑馬爭功」者。　　天水關—亦稱「收姜維」。爲飾演孔明之老生正工戲，自被海派武生將此劇改成姜維主角後，穿改良靠，唱五音聯彈，並改名爲「賢孝子」，而將孔明一角，亦歸掃邊老生承乏矣。　　戰宛城—又名「張繡刺嬸」或「割髮代首」。　　三娘教子—係述三娘機房訓于，後丈夫升官，子中狀元，一家團聚。故又有「機房訓」及「雙官誥」二名。女預言家推測：　好萊塢明星的羅曼史  家璨　　好萊塢有一位著名的女星相家露意絲洛克莉，她住在卡羅的夏飯店，每天往訪者不絕，門庭若市，她的預言不說則已，一說則靈騐非常。例如：去年她預言各小生的紛紛結婚；范朋克的魂歸西天；希迪拉瑪的離婚…等等，都是絲毫不爽，最近她又發表新預言如下，能實現與否，且待事實來證明，現在我們就姑妄言之姑妄聽之吧！　　（一）瑙瑪希拉—她又要結婚了，就是今年她將遇見一位極懂女性心理的男子，這男子非常愛她，由於他的熱心，她將與其結婚。　　（二）安秀麗丹—明年就要跟一個電影界巨頭結婚。　　（三）潘麗茜拉蘭—她將開始結婚爭鬥，也許會結婚。　　（四）琴逮維吉絲—將有新的羅曼史，對方也是好萊場的明星。　　　（五）瓊百朗黛兒—外面謠傳她們家庭不和，但不會離婚，瓊爲流言所苦，結果得到最後牌利。　　（六）喬浩勃侖—他將與有名的女星發生新的而富於風波的羅曼史，總之一九四一年對他是極有希望的一年。　　（七）蓓蒂黛維絲—今年要嫁給一位美國東部的人士。　　（八）瓊克勢馥—情形不很好，佛蘭支東還與她保持友誼關係，雖有各式各樣的愛人，但決不會結婚的。　　（九）奧麗維哈佛爾—她的將來是光舞的，今年她將訂婚，也許不到明年，就會結婚的。　　（十）華雷士皮萊—明年將結婚；這决的對象，是比他小得多的一位年靑女性，愛女卡洛安的事，又將掀起訴訟。　　（十一）裘蒂茄侖—難有羅曼史，但決不會弄假成眞，對她的事業尚無大影響。　　（十二）克拉克蓋博夫婦，今年運氣極佳，但有人將與他暗中搗亂，必須注意，明年五六月間，他們將抱一個黃子做兒子。泰隆鮑華與寶貝白玲  　　加拿大的孿生五姊妹，現已開始教讀，本刊曾於十月廿日紀其詳情。右刋銅圖，乃最近美國寄來的新影。尾首相接的西片名詞  大名　　一代「歌后」　「歌后」情痴　　半夜「風流」　「風流」王孫　　白書「夫妻」　「夫妻」公司　　人猿「泰山」　「泰山」得子　　靑山「紅粉」　「紅粉」金戈　　孤兒「樂園」　「樂園」思凡　　風流「千金」　「千金」之子　　春江「風月」　「風月」無邊　　游擊「戀愛」　「戀愛」大學　　科學「魔王」　「魔王」復活　　無胆「英雄」　「英雄」情種　　銀河「雙星」　「雙星」爭輝　　滿面「春風」　「春風」如意　　戰地「情天」　「情天」歌侶　　蟾宮「仙侶」　「仙侶」情歌　　獸國「女皇」　「女皇」烈史　　鐘樓「怪人」　「怪人」復活大世界將展覽奇獸　　萬國烏行主人顧志剛君，不惜糜　鉅金，特派專員至南菲洲，馬來亞，印度，西康，及泰國等處，費盡人力物力，捕獲世所罕見之珍貴奇獻，如三丈五彩大蟒，能發吼聲之四脚花蛇，潔白如雪之紅眼彌猴，重的千斤之高平龜精，計其年齡約在千年以上。又如泰國人猿，能知人性，靈敏異常。印度狸精，人形貓熊等，均爲人人所愛而不易得見之奇異動物，該項異獸，不久卽將抵滬。顧君因是項動物，其數量與品類之衆多，特商之榮記大世界主人，在內闢一塲地，公開展覽，以供滬上人士參觀，而共飽眼福云。中國「白雪公主」　十二日在新光公映  星星　　陸露明一向被人稱爲健美的明星，速在十年之前，聯華公司到北平去設立第五分廠時，陸露明就進人影界，在聯華的旗幟下服務，此後，一度加入電通，電涌停閉後，才轉入新華。陸露明在演技上，確是一個優秀的人材，她的少奶奶的作風，實可獨步銀壇的，尤其是「日出」中的陳白露，與「紅樓夢」中的尤二姐，都達到了成功的境界。　　國聯趕拍「中國白雪公主」，大家祇知是陳娟娟主演，而由韓蘭抉，湯傑，殷秀岑等合演，但是不要遺忘了，還有一個重要角色，那就是陸露明的飾演白雪公主娘娘一角。昨日，記者於新華攝影塲上，會見陸露明，據談「白雪公主攝製情形，工作相當緊張，因爲是片已定於本月十二日獻映於新光，所以無論如何，須在十日前將該片全部攝竣云。</p>

<p>Hong Kong: A cable just received here from foreign sources in Shamian states that on the morning of the 4th, around 10:30 AM, more than ten major fires broke out within Guangzhou city. Japanese cavalry were seen galloping back and forth, preventing the people from extinguishing the flames. The situation in the city is exceptionally chaotic, and merchants have refused to accept Japanese military scrip. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: We previously learned that Japanese troops had already withdrawn from Yichang. Today, according to reliable intelligence, the Japanese troops will withdraw from Yichang within a few days and retreat to the east of the Hanshui River, planning to establish a new defense line in that area. According to estimates here, about 6,000 Japanese troops have already retreated from Yichang towards Hankou. (5th Hai Tong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese sources in Hong Kong, ten major fires occurred in Guangzhou starting from 10:30 PM last night. It is reported that Japanese cavalry prevented Chinese from putting out the fires. Chinese shops in Guangzhou are now refusing to accept Japanese military scrip. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Well-informed Chinese sources stated today that they explicitly deny the rumors recently circulating here that an early peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese War is possible. These rumors have grown since the Japanese troops withdrew from Guangxi Province and after reports of a fire in Yichang. They claim that Germany has pressured China and Japan to resolve their dispute peacefully as soon as possible and has demanded that Japan withdraw its troops from South China and the Yangtze River basin to open the way for peace negotiations. It is also claimed that China is about to join the Axis powers and that China and Japan will participate in the war against Britain in the Far East. Chinese officials have stated that these rumors are groundless and that Germany has not put forward any peace proposals. Furthermore, there is no official information to confirm the alleged Japanese withdrawal from South China and the Yangtze River basin. (5th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: The cities of Nanning, Zhuji, Shaoxing, and others have been successively recovered. Everyone is extremely encouraged by this news and expresses deep concern for our compatriots in those areas after the calamity. The Central Relief Commission, in addition to ordering the refugee transportation and distribution station originally stationed in Tiandong to move to Nanning as soon as possible to handle local post-war affairs, has specially dispatched Commissioner Zhu Yiyu yesterday to comfort the people and bring 200,000 yuan to work with the Guangxi Provincial Government and the Provincial Relief Association to distribute emergency relief and handle small-scale loans. As for Zhuji and Shaoxing, the Association has already allocated 50,000 yuan, which will be used by Commissioner Wang Yin stationed in Zhejiang, together with local authorities, to properly handle emergency relief and small-scale loans. It is reported that because the Japanese troops occupied Nanning for nearly a year, various production institutions have been almost completely destroyed. Therefore, promoting the development of production enterprises is especially important to alleviate the people's suffering. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanning: A reporter came from Liunan, traveling for four days and nights, and arrived here last night. When passing through Sitang, they visited the defensive works left by the Japanese. The area around the works was covered with barbed wire and many landmines were buried. The reporter, warned by engineers, did not approach rashly. From Sitang down to Nanning, the Japanese had defensive works at various key points, similar to those at Sitang. On this section of the journey, the Japanese did not destroy highway bridges or telephone poles and lines. The fields on both sides were desolate, and most of the people had not yet returned home. Most of the buildings in Nanning city are still standing. The Japanese did not destroy them when they retreated. The electric light plant has been repaired and resumed operation on the 3rd. Less than one-tenth of the city's residents have returned, and there are no businesses that have resumed operation. There are only a few vendors selling food and other items. The Ninth District Commissioner's Office, the Yongning County Government, the County Party Headquarters, the Youth League, and the Student Military Corps Political Work Team, and other agencies and groups have successively entered the city to handle post-war relief work, coordinated by the Joint Party, Government, and Military Office.

<p>Chengdu: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's closing remarks to the Sichuan-Xikang Economic Construction Committee were read by Zhang Qun. The text briefly stated that this meeting brought together many talents, and the discussions were thorough. All the proposals are concrete and practical, which is deeply admirable. Since the publication of the Sichuan-Xikang Economic Construction Outline, more than five months have passed. The central government's expectations of this committee are very high, and society's expectations of this committee are even more earnest. After this meeting, we should express our good ideas together and form a plan. We must be able to promote and organize the various facilities and organization of agriculture, forestry, industry, mining, transportation, and finance in Sichuan and Xikang provinces in a practical and effective manner. The construction of our national revolutionary base will truly begin from now on. The resources of Sichuan and Xikang provinces are extremely abundant, and the human and material resources and social capital are also very abundant. If we can effectively manage and coordinate our efforts, and shift floating capital to production and turn useless things into useful ones, the inland can immediately achieve prosperity, and the people can share happiness and benefits together. I would like to offer three matters to encourage each other. First, judging from the current situation in Sichuan and Xikang, construction must be based on establishing local security and transforming social customs as prerequisites for the Economic Construction Department. Therefore, the two major policies of suppressing bandits and prohibiting opium must be fully implemented by local governments, and social leaders must unanimously support them. We must aim to develop the people's strength, invigorate their will, strictly enforce order, and purify long-standing habits. Only when society has a positive and vigorous spirit can all construction be promoted in an orderly manner. Second, another prerequisite for economic construction is to seek convenient transportation. The central government will not only do its best to promote modern transportation construction but will also refer to the good rules of the past and promote the implementation of the postal transportation system. The governments and societies of our Sichuan and Xikang provinces must, under the overall plan, call on the people at any time and in any place, and make step-by-step efforts to organize and develop water and land transportation. The scale does not have to be large, but it must be persistent, so that production results can be smoothly circulated, and then economic construction can flourish. Third, there have been many discussions on economic construction in the past, but often the plans were beautiful, but the actual results were not abundant, and the beginnings were grand, but they could not be continued halfway through. After the establishment of this committee, we should first strive to correct the mistakes of the past. All administrative expenses and agency expenses should be reduced as much as possible, and the funds used for undertakings must also be used to the fullest extent, using one penny as two pennies, to maximize the effectiveness of public and private funds. There are norms to follow in the achievements of material construction in modern countries, not to mention that our country is in a difficult war, and we cannot afford to waste resources and waste resources. Therefore, all the undertakings promoted and sponsored by this committee must strictly guard against the ills of turning past undertakings into bureaucratic agencies and wash away the shame of the fact that our country's construction undertakings have achieved nothing for decades. This is especially important for all participants to recognize. As the saying goes, "Be cautious in the end as in the beginning," and "To climb high, start from the bottom; to travel far, start from the near." Be precise and practical to lay the foundation for our rear area construction. This is not only the fortune of Sichuan and Xikang provinces, but the future of the country and the nation depends on it. (5th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Examination of the Balkan Dispute <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Italy's invasion of Greece, and Greece's resolute resistance, led to the outbreak of the Balkan War. This happened at 5:30 AM on the 28th of last month. The military strength of the two countries is vastly different; but until today, the black-shirted warriors of Italy, who claim to be responsible for restoring the glorious tradition of the ancient Roman Empire, are still far away, blocked outside their target. The final outcome of the Greek-Italian war almost awaits the final decision of the global situation: and now we can speculate as follows: (1) If Mussolini's strategic goal in launching the military invasion of Greece was to quickly seize the military ports of Crete, and Salonica, so as to threaten the flank of the Central Empire and cover his advance into the Near East and Africa; then Mr. Mo's gamble has failed due to the loyal self-defense of the Greek soldiers. Because the Greek army resisted for ten days, Britain had already obtained sufficient time to take action first. (2) Also, if the intention of this move by Germany and Italy was to save their increasingly declining prestige in view of the failure of the air offensive against Britain; that is, to stimulate domestic morale with a new victory of outward expansion; then Greece, fighting the great with the small, and with great arrogance, is also giving the invaders a considerable blow. (3) Furthermore, if Germany and Italy regarded this as a touchstone for building the so-called "New European Order," thinking that after Greece was conquered in one fell swoop, all the remaining weak European countries would be frightened by it, and from then on, they would all kneel before the "New Order," then this plan has also received a negative answer; because Greece's resistance has given all countries that are unwilling to be slaves to foreign forces a great indication and encouragement, so that some countries that are hovering between the two paths of autonomy and submission, such as Bulgaria and Yugoslavia, know what to choose. This is the result that Greece's heroic resistance in the past ten days has already created.</p>
<p>Let us try to spy on the future: First, examining the military strength of the two sides, the maximum number of the German army is probably around eight million people, and recently, in the area bordering Hungary and the Czech Republic, as well as the Danube River Basin, the German troops concentrated for standby are said to have reached about one million. The maximum number of the Italian army, as Mussolini has repeatedly boasted, is also "in the millions"; but according to more accurate estimates, it can reach at most about six million, and now the number used to attack Greece is said to be only 20,000. In the current situation where there are no large-scale battles in Western Europe, if Germany and Italy decide on a strategy to join forces and move east, then in terms of land forces, Greece, with an area of ​​130,000 square miles and a population of 6.3 million, cannot resist alone. Therefore, purely from the perspective of the fundamental national strength of Germany, Italy, and Greece, there is no need to deny that Greece absolutely cannot maintain support for a long time. Second, the war in the past ten days has been roughly divided into three battle lines: (1) At the northernmost point, the base of the Italian army's attack is Korça in Albania, and the goal is to seize the Greek military port of Salonica; in this regard, the Italian army seems to have invaded Greek territory, but judging from the telegrams, the progress is very slow. (2) In the central part, Greece has launched a heroic counterattack, and it is said that it has invaded the territory of Albania, inflicting considerable damage on the Italian army. (3) In the southernmost part, the Italian army has made the greatest progress, and its target is the Greek capital Athens: there is currently fierce fighting taking place on the Kalamas River. In addition, the Italian air force has also bombed various parts of Greece. Based on the war situation of these ten days, it may take Italy quite some time to conquer Greece. However, we must of course recognize clearly that the truly large-scale war has not yet begun. Germany and Italy now seem to be waiting for Greece to change its mind and surrender; once compromise is hopeless and a large-scale war begins, the war situation will probably not drag on like this for long.</p>
<p>Second, before this European war, the so-called "Balkan Alliance" included four countries: Turkey, Yugoslavia, Romania, and Greece. The troops they can mobilize can probably reach six million people; until the eve of the outbreak of the war, except for Yugoslavia, which had already wavered, Turkey and Britain had signed a mutual assistance agreement, and both Greece and Romania received security guarantees from Britain. In fact, Britain hoped that as soon as the war began, a strong front could be formed in this area to start a war against Germany; but this plan of Britain's finally failed due to three factors: (1) The failure of negotiations between Britain and Romania at that time, Romania refused to participate in aiding Poland. (2) The Soviet Union opposed Turkey's participation in the European war for the benefit of Britain and France. (3) Italy's failure to immediately join the war suppressed the brewing of any hostile action against Germany in this area. By June of this year, after France collapsed, Romania was also controlled by Germany and Italy. Now, if Greece also succumbs, then Yugoslavia's embrace of Germany and Italy is inevitable; as for Bulgaria, which has always been inclined to the Axis countries, needless to say, it will inevitably follow in the footsteps of Hungary and become the vanguard of Germany and Italy's eastward advance. Therefore, from the British point of view, Greece's resistance at least gives Britain an opportunity to maneuver, so that Germany and Italy cannot temporarily complete their attempt to incorporate the entire Balkans (except Turkey) into their own war machine; that is, Greece has given Britain a final opportunity to win the friendship and assistance of the Balkan countries. The crux of the matter after this is whether Britain can still win the friendship of the Balkan countries and form a strong front to resist Germany and Italy's eastward advance?</p>
<p>The answer to this serious question is not necessarily certain, but it is possible. There are two points that can be used as evidence: First, Britain's determination this time is strong, and its aid to Greece is rapid and practical; second, the attitudes of the Balkan countries have gradually changed in the past few days. The collapse of the "Balkan Alliance" in the past should mostly be attributed to Britain's shilly-shallying appeasement policy. Under the pressure of Germany and Italy, small and weak countries have no reliable external assistance, so apart from surrendering and seeking temporary peace, there is really no other way. Now, according to British Navy Secretary Alexander, Britain has indeed made significant efforts for the final periphery of its empire's Near East African part, and troops are being transported to Greece; the impression this gives to small and weak countries is exciting and comforting enough. Under this encouragement, they see Albania on one side and Greece on the other, with different paths of survival and different views of honor and disgrace, which will make Turkey, Yugoslavia, and other countries, if at all possible, surely fight hard for their own survival. In short, the depressed atmosphere of ten days ago has now obviously seen a boost, and Turkey has even gathered a large number of reservists. If the trend is such and the general situation is not decided, the biggest key to whether Britain can finally achieve regaining the friendship of the Balkan countries and reversing the entire situation is by no means a matter that can be achieved by diplomacy and lip service; it still depends on Britain proving its aspirations to share hardships together and taking immediate action!</p>

Behind the deer herds were large packs of wolves chasing and attacking the weak and sick deer. Behind the wolf packs were countless wild rats devouring the remains abandoned by the wolves.

<h3 id="e21">Unprecedented Enthusiasm Across the United States: Voting for New President; Final Results Imminent; Roosevelt Confident of Victory <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Washington – From the skyscraper-laden cities to the remote and impoverished 126,000 electoral districts, between 50 million and 55 million American voters have gathered this morning at polling places to make a decision in the most important presidential election in history. Will the American people, due to the urgent international situation, break precedent and elect Roosevelt for a third term, or, based on Willkie's advocacy of "unity" to restore the foundation of prosperity, will they adhere to the 150-year tradition and elect Willkie? This question is now the main point of debate among Americans. Judging by the current state of the Roosevelt and Willkie campaigns and the arguments they have put forth, the difference in votes between the two sides may not be significant. Therefore, the outcome of this grand competition, a spectacle unseen in recent world history, is still uncertain. Both Roosevelt and Willkie were still competing for votes after midnight on Monday. This morning, both sides believe they can secure victory, as they have made their final appeals to millions of undecided voters. President Roosevelt has concluded his Democratic campaign after completing his national broadcast and speaking tour and has returned to Hyde Park. Willkie, on the other hand, has made numerous speeches in New York City, urging women to support his "non-war" promises. The final results of the election, Shanghai time from 1 p.m. to midnight, will be revealed soon. Seasoned Western politicians are perplexed. Weather will be an important factor in the election. Many believe that good weather will favor Willkie, as he is expected to receive a large number of rural votes, and rural votes are more affected by the weather than urban votes. Other unpredictable factors include: first, the record number of registered voters who could sway the vote; second, the women's vote, which is heavily influenced by the war issue; and third, the division of a large number of labor votes. John L. Lewis, the leader of the powerful Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), supports Willkie, but many groups within the CIO oppose his actions and have expressed their willingness to vote for Roosevelt. The division within the CIO is largely due to this. (International News Service, 5th)</p>
<p>New York – Polling in New York City is scheduled to close at 9 p.m. tonight. There is great concern about the voting situation in New York State, as it has a particularly significant impact. This morning, those gambling on the outcome of the election predicted the odds of Roosevelt and Willkie winning at five to four, which was later changed to six to five, indicating that while Roosevelt's chances of being elected were slightly higher in the eyes of the general public, no definitive conclusion could yet be drawn. (Haitong Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>New York – On the final day of the U.S. presidential election, experts suggest that the chances of victory are extremely slim, and weather will be a major factor in President Roosevelt's chances of winning. It is believed that if it rains, it will favor Roosevelt, as Willkie's supporters in the West will not go out due to the rain, while Roosevelt's supporters are mostly in urban areas and will not be affected by the rain. Polling places in New York opened at 6 a.m. this morning and will close at 9 p.m. tonight, but the provisional final results will not be available until noon tomorrow. (Haitong Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington – As the presidential campaign drew to a close yesterday, various parties issued appeals to voters. Roosevelt and Willkie also made final appeals. Secretary of State Hull stated that the United States needs Roosevelt's continued leadership, while John L. Lewis, leader of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), urged voters to elect Willkie, claiming that foreign agents in the United States are assuring their nationals that the United States will soon join the war if Roosevelt is re-elected. President Roosevelt broadcast from his home in New York, stating that he awaits with complete trust the verdict that will confirm the righteousness of the principles for which he has campaigned.

At the end of his speech, the President appealed to the nation, urging the people to unite and reiterating his hope to avoid involving the United States in war. The President stated that he has great confidence in the outcome of today's election and that the election result will maintain the principles of the New Deal. The President also stated that today's election in the United States will give the United States a "true administrator" and will give the people the traditional freedom of speech to the government, so that free nations may forever be free. He said, "After the votes are tallied tomorrow, the United States will remain united. Americans should thank God that the United States is not currently embroiled in the vortex of war. We hope, under the peaceful and enlightened leadership of heaven, to continue our peaceful lives." (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>Poughkeepsie, New York – President Roosevelt delivered his final pre-election speech here last night, stating that he believes that the German and Italian people will eventually restore their traditional freedoms and align themselves with self-governing systems based on free elections, as in other parts of the world. Although overseas events may seem far away, distances have now been greatly shortened, so it is necessary to understand that domestic peace depends on a clearly understood capacity for self-defense.

Roosevelt reiterated that if he is re-elected, he will not allow the United States to become embroiled in the vortex of war. (International News Service, 5th)</p>

<p>Washington – The U.S. presidential election has become a matter of great international importance. On the eve of the election, private voting surveys have revealed a result of roughly equal strength between the two sides, with gains and losses yet to be foreseen. However, members of both parties expect that their supported candidate will win. Republican newspapers stated that Farley, the director of the New York Democratic Party, has not issued the usual notification of confidence in the party leader, but only sent a telegram stating the importance of all eligible voters casting their ballots. This is considered to be very significant. People in Washington, however, believe that although Roosevelt's bid for a third term faces strong opposition, it may ultimately be realized. The American people have rarely attached such importance to a presidential election. Gatherings and careful deliberations are being held everywhere. One of the biggest features of this election campaign is that both candidates are speaking on war and diplomacy. Roosevelt's promise to aid Britain and his remarks attacking Nazism and communism have been well-received, while Willkie, in recent speeches, has also made promises to aid Britain even more than Roosevelt has done. However, the Republican Party's isolationist tendencies remain a major obstacle for Willkie. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Bangkok – According to reports from Batavia, Japan has issued a statement regarding negotiations between Japan and the Dutch East Indies, stating that the Dutch East Indies authorities do not oppose discussing the issue of economic cooperation requested by Japan. Although initial negotiations have not resulted in any specific agreement, the Dutch East Indies is closely studying what direct and indirect benefits it may derive from economic agreements with the enemies of the Netherlands. Japan expects the negotiations to continue and hopes to achieve ultimate success. (Haitong Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Manila – Radio Australia has recently heard from the Dutch East Indies that the Dutch East Indies government has formally informed the Dutch East Indies National Assembly that the Dutch East Indies will never allow its economic structure to be integrated into any Asian economic group. This declaration is sufficient to indicate that the Dutch East Indies has rejected Japan's demands. (United Press, 5th)</p>

<p>Salt Lake City – An American United Airlines passenger plane crashed and was destroyed yesterday in the area north of here, killing ten people. The wreckage was discovered at an altitude of 7,000 feet near a small village named "丰饶" [Fēngráo, but it seems like a typo and could be intended to mean "丰饶" Fēngráo, which translates to "Bountiful"]. The plane was flying from Elko, Nevada, to this city at 3:40 a.m., carrying seven passengers and three crew members. It encountered a severe blizzard en route. The pilot made every effort to locate the Salt Lake City airport but crashed. Previously, the pilot had radioed that the plane he was flying was eighteen miles north of Salt Lake City and was gradually descending to land. It is now believed that the pilot was unable to see anything in the severe blizzard and was unaware of the large mountain nearby, causing him to descend in an area that was too far north. Since 1934, this is the fourth major passenger plane to crash in the mountains near here. (United Press, 5th)</p>

<p>Aulona, Yugoslavia - News from here states that Greek troops yesterday launched a two-pronged attack on Korytsa. The first route was along the main road to Bilishta, and the second was along the southeast coast of Lesser Prespa Lake. The Greek forces used mechanized units of light tanks for this new offensive. These mechanized units came from the northeast and have crossed into Albanian territory along the road connecting to Bilishta. After this new attack was launched, Greek troops have now occupied the Albanian villages of Noruk, Shaqradet, and Deren. Greek troops occupied these villages after defeating a unit of Italian troops, capturing 180 Italian vehicles, including eight Italian officers. With reinforcements arriving in the Korçë area, the strength of the Greek army is even greater than at the start of the war. The Italian army is now using mortars and light mountain guns to counterattack, and has also moved reinforcements from Pogradec to the southwest corner of Lake Ohrid opposite Korytsa. It is also reported that the Greek troops advancing along the Korytsa road advanced another kilometer yesterday. (United Press, 5th)</p>
<p>National Capital - The main Italian stronghold on the northern front, Korytsa, is likely to fall imminently. The area is already controlled by Greek artillery fire.

<p>Budapest - News from here today: Italian and Greek forces are now engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat in the Florina region. The Italian war machine has intensified its offensive to seize this strategically important Greek railway center, intending to cut off communications behind the Greek front lines. News from Greece and Rome indicates that the Italian army intends to end this blitzkrieg as soon as possible, as it has failed to sweep through Greece since the start of the invasion. News from Athens claims that Greek forces have recaptured "an important bridgehead fortress" on the Kalamas River. This fortress is even deeper than what the Italian army claimed to have penetrated into Greek territory. This news has sparked speculation here, as the Italian army is currently moving south towards the important Adriatic naval base of Preveza.

<p>Three Thousand Italian Troops Surrounded in a Remote Mountain Area, Running Out of Food and Support</p>
<p>Athens - According to reports arriving here today, Greek troops last night surrounded three thousand Italian troops in a remote mountain area, shot down two Italian aircraft, and occupied another plateau in Albanian territory. This news has further invigorated the spirit of the Greek people today. It is also reported that a large Italian contingent of over three thousand men ventured deep into a remote and desolate mountain valley last night, hoping to surprise the Greek army from the rear. However, the Italian troops not only failed to achieve their goal of a surprise victory, but immediately felt threatened, as these three thousand men were almost completely surrounded by Greek mountain troops. This Italian unit then completely lost contact with the main Italian force, and its lines of communication were severely threatened. Unable to find this missing unit, Italian aircraft dropped forty bags of flour and sixty bundles of hay from the air to supply them, and circled above the positions of the Greek troops, but this Italian aircraft was immediately shot down. All personnel on board were captured, including a major from the Italian General Headquarters. Furthermore, the Greek High Command announced that yesterday on the Macedonian front, in addition to occupying a certain plateau that had already been announced, Greek troops occupied another plateau in Albania, and captured several Italian soldiers, several mountain guns, and several machine guns at various points, as well as other pieces of equipment.

He stated that the city had been bombed for four days, with the bombing on the 31st of last month being particularly intense. At that time, the Greek people mistakenly thought that the Italian aircraft were their own, and were unable to escape when the Italian aircraft flew low and dropped bombs. A Greek anti-aircraft artillery captain committed suicide on the 3rd of this month for failing to order the firing of artillery in time. The train station, the city center, and the suburban tram company have all been bombed, suffering heavy losses. Many houses on Tsimiski Street were completely destroyed, and significant damage was done to Vasileos Irakleiou Street, but the Agia Sofia Church remains intact. The Thessaloniki General Post Office has been partially destroyed. All vehicles have been dispatched to transport troops to the front lines. Only a few trams in Thessaloniki are maintaining transportation, and shipping has also been suspended. Residents are fleeing en masse. Coffee and sugar are no longer available for purchase. Bread, fish, and vegetables are still considered plentiful, but meat is scarce. Before the outbreak of the Italian-Greek war, it was only possible to purchase meat twice a week.

In retaliation for the bombing, we also dispatched fourteen aircraft to attack Rhodes and Piraeus. It is reported that the first large-scale battle between Italian and Greek forces is currently underway, with the main forces of both sides reportedly engaged in fierce fighting on the front lines. Foreign military observers have unanimously acknowledged that Italy's assessment of Greek resistance has been grossly mistaken.

<p>On Artificial Sex and the Necessary Maintenance of the Male Body</p>
<p>Modern science has truly made rapid advances, and almost any difficult problem can be solved by science. The great achievements in the field of natural science are indeed too numerous to mention, and the research on human reproductive glands in the field of physiology alone is astonishing! Steinach devoted his life to arduous experiments on human reproductive glands. As a result, he perfected the use of animal reproductive gland extracts to supplement the human body, achieving the effects of curing diseases, prolonging life, and rejuvenating. This shocked the medical world and benefited human health. His great achievements can truly shine as brightly as the sun and moon. However, regarding research on reproductive glands, there have recently been great achievements in the artificial creation of sex. According to Dr. William O. Puckett of the United States, who demonstrated his method of artificial sex at the American Zoological Society, he dissected the reproductive glands of very young frog tadpoles for public examination, pointing out that the sex of tadpoles in this early stage is not yet determined. Their period of sex differentiation is usually in the late stage of the tadpole. At this time, if female or male endocrine secretions (reproductive gland fluid) are injected together with mucus gland from a small organ behind the frog and its shell, the tadpole receiving the female endocrine secretion will become female, and the one receiving the male endocrine secretion will become male. The doctor has repeatedly conducted experiments and can arbitrarily make it female or male. From the success of this experiment, it is not difficult to extend its application to humans. Indeed, after a couple gets married, having sons and daughters and healthy sexual performance in married life are greatly related. A vigorous and healthy husband is more likely to have sons after the honeymoon. In addition, men who maintain their reproductive gland fluids with various hygienic methods, so that they are abundant, can also often have sons. The so-called "pure heart and few desires produce more sons" is indeed a profound truth! However, if a man has committed masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or indulges in excessive sexual activity after marriage, resulting in dysfunction of the seminal vesicle, neurasthenia, and the eruption of spermatorrhea and seminal leakage, causing his energy to dissipate, and suffering from brain and kidney deficiency, forgetfulness, and insomnia, then he will often be unable to fulfill his obligations in married life. In this way, not only is it difficult to have children, but the marital relationship may also be difficult to maintain. Therefore, various tragedies often occur in families, or wives even file for divorce with great justification, which is also common in today's society. As for the man himself, because he is physically weak and suffers such a tragedy, how can he endure it! Due to the pain in his heart, his illness is aggravated, leading to premature aging, or death at a young age. The danger is indescribable! There are many methods of treatment, but according to world-renowned doctors and my own many years of experience, it is generally recognized that taking the reproductive gland extract "Reproductive Hormone" is the most effective treatment. This is because this preparation can produce semen and replenish the kidneys, invigorate the brain and activate the blood every day and night, making men energetic, and deepening the couple's love. Having sons and daughters can be guaranteed. If you continue to take it, you can not only completely cure various male sexual pains, but also achieve the effects of prolonging life, and rejuvenating. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Hemitot's Semen-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the seminal vesicle and stop leakage, achieving even better results! If patients can come to this clinic to be diagnosed by expert physicians and then undergo scientific treatments such as electrotherapy, injections, and surgery, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3 id="e39">The Harm and Salvation of Nocturnal Emission and Masturbation <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>In this chaotic era, crossroads are everywhere, and inexperienced young people are wandering down wrong paths, truly a situation fraught with peril. The most powerful forces that tempt young people are alluring women and self-induced sexual stimulation, because young people at the dawn of love possess an intense curiosity about sex. If they lack proper education and correct guidance at this time, few can avoid being lured by their unhealthy surroundings and falling into the abyss of filth. Taking masturbation and nocturnal emission, the most common offenses among young people but overlooked by society, their severe harm is even greater than floods and fierce beasts! First, the number of young people who masturbate is almost too numerous to count. The direct victims are their own sexual nerves, which are ruined, leading to a loss of control of the seminal gate and an oversensitivity of the ejaculation process, resulting in nocturnal emission. Once nocturnal emission begins, it is like having a slippery valve, and a large amount of essence is inevitably lost from the body, causing all parts of the body to become depleted. Various symptoms of weakness, such as brain fatigue and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, backaches and pains, and kidney deficiency and impotence, then follow one after another. The individual's health and the future of their happiness are thus plunged into the darkness of night. Second, due to the damage to sexual function, they will certainly be unable to enjoy a fulfilling married life after marriage. As a result, the wife's youth is wasted and her happiness is ruined, like sending her into a tomb of pain. At the same time, what about the happiness that should be part of their own life? It is unknown whether it will be thrown into a fog or to the far reaches of the sky. Third, from childhood to youth, the burden and cultivation of young people by their parents, siblings, teachers, and the nation is considerable. In terms of the family, they fully expect them to establish a career and bring honor to their ancestors. In terms of society and the nation, they fully expect them to become construction technicians and loyal and brave soldiers on the battlefield, so that they can be capable personnel on the road to resisting the war and building the nation. However, in reality, can they meet these expectations? According to what we know, most young people are sinking into the low-level interests of masturbation and promiscuous pleasure and cannot extricate themselves. How can we not sigh! Conscious young people! At this once-in-a-lifetime, critical juncture, we must use the greatest determination to quit our masturbation and promiscuous pleasure, and take the most effective medicine, "Himei Tuo's Essence-Solidifying Tablets," to strengthen the seminal gate, relieve the oversensitive state of ejaculation, and fundamentally treat nocturnal emission. If nocturnal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, it is especially necessary to also take the gonadotropic hormone preparation "Shengzhisu" to nourish the brain and kidneys and increase essence and blood, so that complete recovery of health can certainly be achieved in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Health and Beauty</p>
<h3 id="e40">The Value of Breast Beauty <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>High and elastic breasts are the soul of a healthy and beautiful woman.</p>
<p>A high pair of breasts, set off by a graceful figure, and plump hips, plus a fair and rosy face, adorned with willow eyebrows and cherry lips, revealing pearly teeth and a delicate nose, such a healthy and beautiful woman is not only revered as a goddess by her husband at home, with deep affection between the two, but also when she goes out into society, she is like a moon surrounded by stars everywhere, receiving warm welcomes.</p>
<p>However, such healthy and beautiful women are still a minority in the world. The main reason is that for a woman to achieve the above-mentioned health and beauty, it all depends on the full soundness of the ovarian function. If the ovarian function is sound, then the characteristics of the woman will have good development. The most obvious is that the breasts are firm and elastic, rising in a peak shape. Even if she wears tight and narrow clothes, they will still protrude from the chest. The twin peaks stand opposite each other, with a deep and secluded valley. This is so intoxicating. At the same time, the hips must also be quite developed, and coupled with a lively willow waist, it forms the most mysterious and lovely complete curve of a woman. However, only women with good development can enjoy these characteristics. Others who indulge in weakness and masturbation in their early years, or suffer from irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, or weakness after illness, leading to the deterioration of ovarian function, are disgusted by it, and have difficulty in giving birth. Even in terms of personal temperament, they are often stubborn, narrow-minded, sentimental, and melancholy. The god of happiness and joy has no connection with her. Therefore, the prospects and fate are tragic and unimaginable! To seek a cure, one can only rely on science. According to world-renowned gynecologists such as Oansnasr and Kang Sinan, and according to my experience, it is generally recognized that taking the ovarian preparation for women, "Shengzhisu," is the most effective treatment, especially afterwards. Because this medicine can nourish the ovarian function after taking it, vigorously promote metabolism. If you continue to take it, it is guaranteed that the above-mentioned symptoms will be completely cured in a short period of time, and the breasts will gradually rise, transforming ugliness into beauty.</p>

<p>Montauban, France. Former President of the Spanish Republican Government, Azaña, came here as a resident after the failure of the Civil War in the spring of 1939. He passed away suddenly last night at the age of sixty. According to news from Vichy, the Mexican ambassador to France, Rodriguez, accompanied by his private secretary and military attache, has already set off to handle the funeral arrangements. It is reported that President Azaña was born on January 1, 1880, in the city of Alcalá (the hometown of the author of *Don Quixote*, Cervantes). He loved literature and philosophy from a young age and enjoyed a great reputation in the literary world. At the age of thirty-three, he served as the Secretary-General of the Ateneo de Madrid, dedicating himself to the study of literature and philosophy for seventeen years. He did not participate in the revolution until the age of fifty, overthrowing the monarchy. When the Republican government was established on April 14, 1931, he took up the post of Minister of War and began to reorganize the Spanish army. At that time, as many as 14,000 junior officers were dismissed, and the army's discipline was strict and its lineup was brand new. At the end of the year, Prime Minister Zamora was elected President of the Republican government, and Azaña filled the vacant position. During his tenure, his policies were too left-leaning and were criticized by public opinion. In September 1933, more than 30 anti-Republican party members were hastily executed in Viches, and public opinion became even more outraged. Azaña resigned on September 12, 1933, and traveled all over the country, delivering speeches everywhere, criticizing the new cabinet without reservation. On February 16, 1936, the Lower House was re-elected, and the left wing won again. Azaña made a comeback and once again served as Prime Minister, actively promoting the policy of the Popular Front. When President Zamora resigned on April 7 of the same year, Azaña was elected to succeed him. The civil war between the Republican government and the Nationalist army broke out during his tenure. It was not until the spring of 1939 that Azaña, knowing that the Republican government no longer had any hope of winning, immediately resigned voluntarily and fled to France to spend the rest of his years.

<p>A Painful History of the European War (1)</p>
<h3 id="e44">The Beginning and End of the Split Between England and France <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The Queen saw me and said to me: "Mr. Morale, I feel extremely sad about the fate of Paris. I express my deep sympathy for the misfortunes of your country's people. I love France very much. Two years ago, when we visited Paris, my heart was connected to the women of your country. Tonight, I plan to talk to them about everything on the radio and express my true feelings."</p>
<p>She then discussed the wording of the broadcast with me and asked about the whereabouts of my wife and children. Her words were sincere. I replied that their whereabouts were unknown. Her gentle eyes showed infinite sympathy, and she was even close to tears, which moved me greatly. When she said, "I deeply love France," I felt that this was not a diplomatic formality, but came from her heart. Like the Queen, the British people originally wanted to do their best to help France, but it was too late.</p>
<p>After Paris fell, Churchill flew to Tours. At that time, France was already in a state of disintegration, which shocked him. No one greeted him at the airport where he landed: no government officials, no representatives. The city was full of refugees, and it took him a lot of effort to find the location of the French government.</p>
<p>In a villa on the banks of the Loire River, French Prime Minister Reynaud told him that he would still insist on fighting to the end, but he might have to resign. The successor cabinet might have to request an armistice. What was Britain's attitude? Churchill stated that he could not release France from the restraint of not making a separate peace. This was the last meeting between the two giants, Reynaud and Churchill.</p>
<p>On June 27, I went to Welland to see Sir Phipps, the former British Ambassador to France. He invited me to listen to the French broadcast together. In the radio, the battle cry of "Citizens, rise up and join the army!" was being sung, and I could not help but sob. I soon learned that Reynaud had gone to the League and the new government had requested a truce. I believe that my British friends, in this mutually painful environment, their accommodating attitude was indeed in line with their noble traditional spirit. They immediately recognized that both sides were at fault in this tragedy, and there was no need to blame each other. Sir Griggs, an official of the War Department, said to me:</p>
<p>"What I want to tell you is that we understand everything and do not blame you. We were unable to help you in time. There was no other way for you but to do this."</p>
<p>He then talked to me about the French fleet. This was what all the British were worried about. In the following days, the atmosphere became even more dangerous. The terms of the armistice caused serious panic. It is said that Sir Campbell, the British Ambassador to France in Bordeaux, was no longer able to obtain any news. Coupin, the French Ambassador to England, also resigned because he disregarded the government he represented and his usual views.</p>
<p>At the last moment, Churchill still wanted to persuade Reynaud's cabinet to continue fighting, advocating that the two great powers of England and France should be merged and governed by one government, with a French person serving as chairman. The people of both countries would have dual nationality. All financial resources and materials would be owned by both countries. This amazing proposal, if put forward a few weeks earlier, would have changed the course of the war. Unfortunately, at that time, France was exhausted and only asked for "immediate" assistance with airplanes, tanks, and artillery.</p>
<p>I heard that General Weygand had mentioned an incident involving Churchill. In the Boer War in South Africa, Churchill had just jumped off a train when he was caught by two South African natives who pointed guns at his chest.</p>
<p>General Weygand said: "If at that time, someone on the train had said to Churchill, 'Resist them—I have enough wealth at home for you to take,' this suggestion would certainly not have been able to save the situation. Now France's situation is the same. It can only 'obey fate,' just like Churchill."</p>
<p>The author does not know whether this is true or false, but his analogy is quite appropriate. However, on Churchill's side, he believed that his suggestion was of great benefit to France, even shocking Congress and confusing the people, who blamed him for being excessive. Now that he sees the other party's unresponsive attitude, he cannot avoid feeling deeply hurt. Many British people also shared his regret, especially those friends who loved France the most.</p>
<p>The British political commentator McCassey said to me: "I am ashamed! I would be very happy to be a French citizen!"</p>
<p>I spent a long night with him and another talented writer, Montemolle, discussing the past and the present, slightly alleviating my worries. McCassey's words were particularly important.</p>
<p>He said: "First, we British people must not forget our friends and their deep friendship. Even if we are far apart and have not heard from each other for many years, even if the French say that the English are all monsters, and the English hear that the French have abandoned them halfway, we must still remember that there are some French people and some English people who have noble minds and practice loyalty and forgiveness. Whenever we have the opportunity, we should love each other and be ten times more affectionate than usual. There is a lack of affection and sincerity in the world, and we must make up for it."</p>
<p>The scene that night and what I saw and heard in the homes of many friends gave me a better impression of England. However, the difficult environment made me very painful. The relationship between the two countries became increasingly serious. General Tagger, a French tank expert, had organized the French National Committee in London and recruited volunteer soldiers, which raised many conscientious questions for many French people. Some people believed that in times of national crisis, one should not engage in separatist movements. Some people were unwilling to recognize the armistice and joined General Tagger.</p>
<p>London and Bordeaux were even attacking each other on the radio. I was deeply saddened by this pointless dispute. Although I advocated stopping at the appropriate time, it had no effect.</p>
<p>At that time, Britain only had one thought in mind: how to strengthen its national defense. In May, Britain did not have a fully equipped army that could be sent to France. By July, it had a million well-trained soldiers who could take up arms to defend the country and resist the strong enemy. Canadian troops and Australian troops would also fight on British soil for the first time. Defensive positions were everywhere in cities and towns. The General Headquarters had learned a lesson from the painful experience of France and ordered the people to stay at home when attacked to avoid interfering with military operations. Each village recruited volunteers to defend against enemy paratroopers. A spirit of courage and bravery was evident everywhere, and it was unprecedented. Britain suddenly realized that France could not be relied upon as a wall and was severely shaken, worrying about the safety of the three islands. But when danger was imminent, the British nation did not flinch, but became even more courageous, as it had shown in its past history.</p>
<p>On July 2, the French military liaison group dismissed me from my post. Since then, because of the severance of transportation between England and France, and because I had agreed to give lectures at Harvard University, I decided to leave England for the United States. The ship I took across the Atlantic was the one that Britain used to send children to Canada. The scene I saw on deck at that time was very moving. A thousand children were playing in the sunlight, surrounded by the cannons that protected them. The escort ships included one cruiser and two destroyers. On the ship, I received the shocking news of the Battle of Oran (referring to the battle in which the British fleet attacked the French fleet in the French African port of Oran). Of all the misfortunes that had befallen me in recent weeks, this was the most terrible. Although I was born a Frenchman, I had had twenty years of friendship with England. I am now like a child whose parents have announced their divorce. Even if I live with my mother, the pain is still imaginable. I said in my heart: "Whether right or wrong, I will always love my country." My reason tells me that the separation of these two nations, which urgently need mutual assistance, is a great regret. I leaned on the railing and looked out. The sea was surging, and the cruiser was running alongside the ship. The British mate saw that I was very worried, brushed past me, and remained silent. At this moment, I suddenly remembered McCassey's words, "No matter what our experience is, never forget that our friendship remains unchanged." I unconsciously sang the Scottish song "Should auld acquaintance be forgot..." A light was hanging high on the turret of the cruiser, and its flashing light was conveying a mysterious message to us.

<h3 id="e45">Responsible Person of Yanjing University Says: Yanjing University Will Not Be Closed; American Faculty Will Not Leave Temporarily; Wu Qianxiaochang Scholarship Committee Formed <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong News) Recently, there have been rumors in Beiping that Yanjing University will be closed due to the evacuation of American expatriates. People from all walks of life are very concerned about the situation of the school. According to a responsible person who just came to Hong Kong from Beiping to discuss raising funds for the "Mr. Wu Leichuan Scholarship" for the 70th birthday of the school's former president, Wu Leichuan, Yanjing University will not be closed due to the situation. American faculty and staff have also decided not to leave temporarily under the current circumstances. The school's president, Stuart Leiden, gave a speech to all students on this matter when he came to Hong Kong (October 11) and instructed them to convey this message to students in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places. President Stuart's speech stated, "The United States Department of State recently advised Americans in China who have families, especially women and children, or who do not need to be in China, to prepare to leave unsafe areas when the situation is very serious. As for the general American people who are related to Yanjing, they have decided to stay here unless the environment evolves to the point where it is absolutely impossible to allow it. According to my (Stuart's) personal observation, the situation will not deteriorate in the near future. This action by the United States is only a precaution. Yanjing will not be affected by it in the near future. Students do not need to worry." In addition, the number of students at the school has recently increased sharply. The number of students this year has reached more than 1,000 (before the war, there were only 700). The school's curriculum and student life are proceeding smoothly as usual.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding the fundraising for the former president of the school, "Mr. Wu Leichuan Scholarship," the school's Hong Kong alumni have organized a committee to carry out fundraising among students in Hong Kong, Macao, and Guangdong. It is currently preparing to raise 10,000 yuan in national currency in the above three places.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Children's Welfare Association's work in nurturing children and providing relief has garnered sympathy and support from society. It has already established four newspaper boy education classes, accommodating over one hundred newspaper boys, and taken in over eighty homeless children from the streets, providing them with education and skills so that they will not lack means of livelihood when they grow up. The association's operating expenses have always come from donations from all walks of life. Recently, it has felt that prices are soaring and expenses are increasing sharply, making it difficult to sustain operations. Therefore, the association has, together with famous Shanghai calligraphers and painters such as Ya Chen, Li Qiujun, Ma Gongyu, Xie Haiyan, Xie Gongzhan, and Yan Wenliang, organized a charity sale of calligraphy and paintings to raise funds for maintenance. These details have been reported in previous newspapers. Now, we understand that the solicited works have been generously donated by prominent figures in the art world, benefiting child welfare in a significant way. The previous deadline for soliciting donations was November 1st, but to expand the solicitation, it has been decided to extend the deadline to November 20th. At the same time, we are soliciting donations of goods for charity sale. We hope that major manufacturers will have charitable hearts and generously donate.

<p>The Shanghai Workers' Volunteer School at 809 Tokyo Road, West Shanghai, was founded by Chen Dashen from Anhui. It is currently divided into two schools. Since the beginning of the current semester, three months have passed, and enrollment has been exceptionally enthusiastic. However, regarding the issue of funding, we earnestly hope that benevolent people from all walks of life will generously contribute. Although most of the students' families belong to the laboring class and earn meager monthly wages, their enthusiasm for public welfare is not behind anyone. In the current "Thrift Movement," the families of students from the first school donated a total of seventy-six yuan and thirty cents. In addition, a worker named Wang Aimin from a certain factory donated five yuan from his wages, which is truly commendable. It is reported that the second school is also conducting fundraising activities.</p>

<p>In the securities gray market, yesterday's market conditions unexpectedly progressed due to a short squeeze. Circulating chips, especially Type C, were temporarily in short supply. Because more non-industry people were continuously buying goods, the short squeeze suddenly pushed Type C up to 63 yuan. Other types also rose with it. It is found that the total number of unified public debts of various types is 240 million, of which 200 million have been transferred to the mainland, and about 40 million are stored in Shanghai. The current market price is already higher than the market price in the 25th year of the Republic of China, or a large number of spot goods may flow out. Yesterday, Tong Kang still bought Lianyi and Lianhe to cover shorts. In addition, there were several companies such as Jiufeng Tongji Hengfu Gongmao Tongshun. Especially a large number of retail investors took advantage of this short squeeze to actively go long, which was the most lively. As a result, the market price gradually rose, and Type C was as high as 62 yuan and 5 jiao. Various unified debts saw new high prices. The total amount of transactions was about 3.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday's stock market was very strong. After the opening, a large number of floating longs were closed, which were quickly absorbed. New buyers continued to emerge, and the price moved forward. Investors seemed to be waiting for the results of the US election to be announced, so although the trading volume was large, it could not be said to be very huge. International, British Union, Jardine Matheson, and Ewo Cotton Mill stocks were the most outstanding. The trend of stocks of various East India rubber companies was also firm.</p>
<p>London, 4th (Monday) cable, today's listing prices of Chinese foreign debt and British-owned Far East companies' stocks, bonds were slightly better, and prices rose more than they fell.

As a result, the forward and spot British gold and US exchange rates were consistent.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants and Hong Kong Gang Have Entries</p>

<h3 id="e56">Gold Market Mediocre <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold gray market had no special performance, and the trend was hovering and mediocre. Therefore, rises and falls were seen mutually. China Gold always bought in, and the price was pulled up after it was low. Until noon, it was often outside 500 yuan. The later market was even stronger, but the money exchange industry and securities gang blocked more, and the price was suppressed. The evening closing was 5,510 yuan, only 18 yuan higher than the previous day's short squeeze. The total amount of transactions throughout the day was more than 2,000 taels. The silver building decorations were ultimately unchanged, and the customs duties were stable.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Short Squeeze Was Very Slight</p>

After opening, the securities gang sold to the silver house 20 taels, falling more than 10 yuan, for 5,475 yuan. However, gold houses and silver houses were inclined to buy in at this time, although the amount was not large, the price had returned from low to high, estimated that the gold house entered the securities gang 10 taels, for 5,510 yuan. However, retail investors held back and waited for high prices to sell, and high prices were difficult to stand, estimated that the silver house sold to the money exchange industry 20 taels, changed to 5,485 yuan. Later, the foreign exchange loose trend turned tight, and the selling momentum stopped immediately, and the buying sound on the floor was high again, estimated that the silver house did 20 taels, as high as 5,535 yuan. At noon, the silver house spit out to the gold house 20 taels, still reported 5,520 yuan, as the midday closing price. In the early afternoon, the situation was very high, estimated that the gold house entered the silver house 10 taels, there were 5,510 yuan, but among them, the money exchange industry and silver houses spit out from time to time, falling after each rise, estimated that the silver house sold to the money exchange industry 20 taels, for 5,515 yuan, the silver house again entered the gold house 20 taels, and again reported 5,528 yuan, after all, because supply exceeded demand, it finally retreated to 5,505 yuan. Before the closing, it reached 5,520 yuan again, and as a result, the closing was 5,510 yuan, slightly higher than the previous day by 18 yuan, a fluctuation of 75 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the spot gold from cash houses was more than 10 yuan higher than the spot gold, and the buying price was 30 yuan lower, and the current standard gold was 50 to 60 yuan lower than the listing gold, and few transactions were made.</p>

<h3 id="e57">US Currency Market Alone Was Firm <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market, the spot gold market price rose slightly, and the British and American gold pounds also rose slightly by 5 jiao, and the British gold notes were still rarely traded, and the market price remained fixed as before. The American gold notes initially retreated to 15 yuan, 8 jiao, and 9 fen, but immediately rose steadily, once as high as 16 yuan and 7 fen, and then took advantage of the low to fall, and finally to 15 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen, a short squeeze of 2 fen higher than the previous day. The Hong Kong notes, however, because there were endless suppliers, the market price was tired and fell, and the Japanese gold notes and Korean notes both trended lower, the former retreating to 1 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen, and the latter falling to 1 yuan, 1 jiao, and 9 fen.</p>

<p>The yarn market turned upward, but actual transactions were not very active. However, most speculators, because the 1,150 yuan mark was not broken through twice, had a slight change of mind, and all had a temporary nature to buy in and go long. As a result, the chips on the table felt tight, and the pulling force was stronger, and the market rebounded.</p>
<p>Now silk, the atmosphere in the opening market was still peaceful, and the price of 20-count Double Horse was 1,180 yuan, falling to 1,176 yuan. Then it was heard that the foreign exchange market was stable, but rumors rose together, and the gold gang and the securities gang came one after another, and all dragged in to add weight. As a result, the momentum turned tight, and the market slowly rose to 1,196 yuan. However, the long head suddenly came to sell, and another drop was seen, but floating households still tended to buy, and the price rose again to outside 1,200 yuan. It is found that the transaction statistics for half a day totaled 5,800 bales, and the 20-count Double Horse market price rose by 16 yuan.

<p>Spot cotton transactions are normal. In fact, the Yuanfang has many guests who have purchased foreign cotton, which will soon arrive in Shanghai, and the price is much cheaper than in Shanghai. At the moment, consumption is limited, so the purchase of spot goods is not prosperous. However, the yarn market has slightly rebounded, and the cotton market may improve one step.</p>
<p>The price of Changyin cotton is 217 yuan to 18 yuan, the price of Pingguoer is 173-4 yuan, and the price of Pengjiapu is 263-5 yuan. Today, 280 bales of cotton will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market conditions, initially presented a firm appearance, and then because of the firm stock prices in the Chinese business street, and part of the short covering, as a result, the closing price rose 5-6 pounds higher than the previous day. Indian companies, along with forecasts, rose more than 2 rupees yesterday. Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions have continued to be abnormally quiet in recent days. Factories have a weak intention to purchase, and counterparts are also holding a wait-and-see attitude. However, because the market inventory is not abundant, the selling price is slightly stagnant.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Piece Goods - Cotton Cloth Rises Wildly <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The factory cloth market yesterday calmed down with rumors, and hoarders began to move again. Guests and counterparts also absorbed at low prices, and transactions suddenly became prosperous. Selling prices of various cloths uniformly rebounded, bleached and dyed cloth rose 2.5 to 5 jiao, coarse cloth rose 1 to 2.5 jiao, fine cloth twill rose 2.5 to 5 jiao, Fugui fine cloth increased to 32.5 yuan, fine twill 31 yuan. More than 800 pieces were transacted on this street, with hoarders absorbing a larger amount. Zhejiang and Fujian merchants handled more than 300 pieces of blue cloth, line cloth, and colored twill, Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants handled more than 100 pieces of colored cloth and colored twill, and overseas Singapore and other places handled more than 6,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and twill.

Longtou fell to 35 yuan and 3.5 jiao, and serge fell to 1 yuan and 8 fen. However, counterparts believed that actual sales were good, and most were bullish.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Single-Sided Flannel is Still Popular <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>

Chinese-style long gowns and robes, and Western-style sweater materials were all selling well. Navy blue and dark blue were selling more smoothly, and the sales of camel color were slightly sluggish. There are various patterns, such as wide stripes, narrow stripes, fine stripes, two-three stripes, one-three stripes, and two-three stripes, each with its own needs.

<p>Foreign rice continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Taikoo Company's Jinan wheel arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, carrying 1,522 bags of foreign rice from Hong Kong, docked at the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession for unloading. Jardine Matheson's Lisheng wheel also arrived at the port yesterday morning, carrying 200 bags from Hong Kong, and docked at the Yisifu wharf for unloading.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market soared again yesterday, and spot and forward goods all rose uniformly. However, the reason for the rise was not unexpected digestion and high production prices, but only because of the recent lack of ship space and reduced orders. As for the fixed price, it is still generally planned, and people's hearts have been brought up. Speculators and floating longs are all taking advantage of the situation to be active, and cargo owners are also trying to defend the price. Therefore, the opening price in the early market rose step by step, and the midday market had risen nearly 1 yuan compared to the day before yesterday. In the afternoon, the buying momentum was even stronger, and cargo owners were very persistent in defending the price, so the price rose more than 1 yuan. As a result, the spot rice was about 2 yuan higher than the day before yesterday. New transactions were not settled, and the opening price of imported No. 2 Saigon was shouted at 73 yuan, and then from 73.5 to 73.8 yuan. The afternoon saw even more beauty, and a certain party sold 500 tons, and the price reached 74.5 yuan, which was 1.7 to 2 yuan higher than the day before yesterday. Spot transactions throughout the day also exceeded 10,000 bags. The total amount of imported original packages was 800 tons, estimated No. 1 Saigon at 66.5 to 66 yuan, No. 2 at 61.7 jiao, 61.1 jiao, Huojiao at 64.5 jiao, determined to be 61.8 jiao, No. 2 Siam at 60.05 yuan, 60 yuan, Xiaowen at 60.07 jiao, 59.5 jiao, Tokyo tip at 55 yuan, broken tip at 51.2 jiao, 50 yuan, Milu at 51.1 yuan, 54 yuan, Wuhu tip at 59.4 jiao, 59 yuan.</p>
<p>New Japonica tip and tea, wild rice, etc. totaled more than 1,000 dan, of which new Japonica was very few, but the sales market was unique, resulting in a situation where it was insufficient for distribution for a while, and the price increased by 1-2 yuan. The original package specially opened at 81-2 to 80 yuan, the second at 76 yuan, the dan was seen at 77 yuan, 74-5 yuan. The green seed wild rice was just average, opened wild rice at 80.05 yuan, 80 yuan, the green seed at 77.5 yuan, 76 yuan. Duyang tip also lacked honor and disgrace, the original package of Du tip was specially 72 yuan, Yang tip was 67 yuan, and the removal of glutinous rice was again lax, which was a fixed decision, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Foreign Flour Can Arrive in Ten Days <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour market was as flat as ever, and the Hua flour factory's market price stood firm and did not move. The two factories wholesaled more than 8,000 bags, which was quite enough for the needs of this street. The recycled goods, the old Che flour, had few chips, and the stomach was weak early on, so supply and demand were both silent, and there were no agreements. The foreign flour continued to be in a state of stagnation, and according to foreign bank news, the foreign flour determined by this decision will generally arrive in about ten days, and there are few days left, and people's hearts are uneasy, and speculative buying and selling are even less involved. It is heard that this street purchased 200 bags of Double Eagle brand foreign flour, and the price was 18.5 yuan, similar to the Hua flour's guest price. Yesterday, 200 bags of flour came from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Wheat - The arrival was sparse and the sales were weak, and the market was without any excitement. It is found that since the Japanese factory was ordered to prohibit transportation to the concession, the production of Phoenix flour has suddenly decreased, so the need for raw materials is also not greedy. In addition to the goods sent to the factory, the price is limited, and only 100-odd bags are received every day, and they are not bought in the market. The Hua factory and other sales households also lack goods to receive, so the transaction becomes quiet every day.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Oil Cake - Hoarders in the Oil Market are Stirring <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's oil market in the morning trend, inheriting the previous day's withering situation, the market continued to be downstream, and the transaction was quite sluggish. By the time the market closed in the afternoon, rumors were rife, and the falling trend stopped immediately. The reason was that the Qingdao market reported a rise, the international situation was very tight, and there was a shortage of ship space, so speculators had another excellent opportunity, and the market atmosphere jumped frequently. Far-term raw oil was particularly popular, and a total of 50 dan of Daya Factory soybean oil were opened, the price being 84.25 yuan, 300 cans of Yantai listening to raw oil, the price being 101 yuan, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil, the price being 72.5 yuan to 71.5 yuan, 200 barrels of Qingdao raw oil, the price being 101 yuan to 05 jiao, the closing being 07.5 jiao, 300 barrels were handed over in late November, the price being 101.25 yuan to 05 jiao, and it rose to 01.5 yuan, 800 barrels were ordered for late December, the price being 102.75 yuan, falling to 01.75 yuan, and then stepped up to 03 yuan to close the market.</p>
<p>Today, 215 bags of soybeans and 585 cans of raw oil will be shipped to Hong Kong, and 400 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Singapore.</p>

<p>The sugar market turned loose because actual sales were weak. The association's planned market spot goods 2-4 coarse white this stack 71 yuan, outer stack 70.5 yuan, a total of 5 jiao, Taikoo's Che white upper grade was very hard, and the lower grade was also 5 jiao, B-Xixi machinery 70.5 yuan, Dong stack 70 yuan, DY Mark West stack 66.2 jiao, HX Mark Si stack 66 yuan, Dong stack 65.5 jiao, HM Mark Dong stack 62.8 jiao, Hechi spot goods 53.8 yuan to 4 yuan, road goods 54 yuan to 4 yuan and 2 jiao, the factory's No. 1 ice 91.5 yuan, Jingming ice 93 yuan, and 860 bags of sugar came from Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Few preserved dates have been transported and arrived, and the market stock is also thin, but since the sales season has passed, the removal from all sides is relatively sluggish, and the market price has slightly loosened. Yesterday, the bald price was 125 yuan, and the rest were returned as before.</p>

<p>Tong Deli Bai Mou, although the gray market was already tight last week, because the hoarders took advantage of the high to come out of the cage, the market still had spot goods to receive. As of now, the old orders have been exhausted, and a certain bank has closed and stopped selling, and the market atmosphere has become more tense. Numbers 1 and 2 blocks have been shouted at 226 yuan, but there are still few transactions. The prices in this street's stores are uniformly picked up, and it is estimated that each set of festival blocks is 12 yuan, and each load of Lingjiao Kao blocks is 12.4 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Silk and Tea - Silk Price Gradually Falls <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local silk market had very few transactions, and the silk price was stagnant and weak. Yesterday, the white factory sold 81 points at 4,760 yuan, and compared with the record in early October, it gradually fell, and it has seen a huge amount of 500 jiao. This is probably due to the sluggish silk price abroad.</p>
<p>The Yokohama silk price is unchanged, and the spot goods are maintained at a slightly higher level of 25 yuan, and the trend may be better, because the far-term goods have turned firm. The ups and downs of the New York silk price are slight, with only a difference of one or two cents.</p>
<h3 id="e69">From New York Raw Silk Statistics: US Ban on Japanese Silk Imports Seems a Trivial Act <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The import and sales of raw silk in New York in October both improved, with imports increasing by 17,336 bales. Among them, Shanghai silk only increased by 250 bales, while Japanese silk increased by 17,336 bales. This proves that the US ban on Japanese silk imports is a trivial matter. Therefore, silk prices in October were also quite bullish. According to reports, Yokohama once rose to 1,500 yuan in that month, but fell in the second half of the month. The consumption of raw silk in New York increased by 2,049 bales in October, due to seasonal factors.</p>

<p>Since the South Zhejiang merchants stopped dealing in wire nails, the wire nail market has been weak. In addition, the volume of Tianjin flue-cured tobacco and blue cloth from the northern route has also decreased, resulting in a sluggish market and a lack of activity. Although construction companies, warehousing companies, and occasional users on this street occasionally make purchases and sales, the amount is very small and insufficient to affect the overall situation. Therefore, once the market loses momentum, morale declines, and prices continue to fall, with each barrel of Bessemer steel wire rods at 53 yuan. However, due to the continuous arrival of overseas goods for its raw material (wire rod), relying only on the existing inventory in this port, the industry's thinking is quite firm, and the market price is holding steady, still quoted at 55 yuan per bale. Also, yesterday, 88 pieces of copper, 95 packages of ore, and 137 pieces of rattan were shipped from Hong Kong.</p>

<h3 id="e71">The American Community in Shanghai Unanimously Supports Roosevelt's Re-election Due to His Assistance to China, Which Has Won Him Unlimited Sympathy. The Only Criterion for President is the Ability to Fulfill the Role. <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>While 50 million citizens in the United States voted in the presidential election yesterday, the American community in Shanghai held a mock vote, with over 90% supporting Roosevelt's continued tenure as master of the White House. The American community in Shanghai's widespread support for Roosevelt today is in stark contrast to 1936, when over 90% of the American community supported Landon and hoped he would become the next president. According to a well-known American in Shanghai who is concerned about politics, this rapid shift of enthusiastic support from one party to another in just four short years is unprecedented among American communities around the world.</p>
<p>Familiarity Breeds Confidence, Forever Enjoying Public Trust</p>
<p>It is said that the reason why the American community in Shanghai is leaning towards the Democratic Party is that both Europe and Asia are currently at war. The choice of president is no longer based on political party affiliation, but only on who is best suited for the job. Roosevelt has eight years of experience in the White House, not only is he familiar with the work, but also his admirable diplomatic skills make him the most qualified presidential candidate. Most Americans deeply believe that the next four years will be the most difficult period in American history.</p>
<p>Future New Deal, Suitable for National Conditions</p>
<p>He also pointed out that Roosevelt's New Deal is not fascism. Due to the experience of the past four years, people have begun to realize that America's future policies and domestic plans can no longer use "individualism" as a slogan. They understand that certain social undertakings must be governed by the government, and power, materials, and manpower must be better managed. The purpose of the New Deal is to achieve this. Fewer members of the American community in Shanghai are betting on this presidential election because no one is betting on Wilkie, and most deeply believe that Roosevelt will be re-elected. They also pointed out that even on Wall Street, Roosevelt's odds would be 8 to 5. From Jones of the US Navy to Commissioner Hermlik, all expressed that "Roosevelt will be invincible."</p>
<p>Most of the Shanghai Community Supports Roosevelt</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, a reporter inquired about the opinions of the American community in Shanghai last night (4th). The 48 states in the United States will hold presidential elections today (5th). Roosevelt and Wilkie, the two presidential candidates, are competing fiercely. If Americans living in Shanghai could participate in the election, the number of votes in favor of Roosevelt serving a third term as president would greatly increase. It is estimated that 75% of Americans in Shanghai support Roosevelt. In the past few months, very few members of the American community in Shanghai have turned to Wilkie. However, supporters of President Roosevelt admit that there are also many people within the United States who originally intended to vote for Roosevelt, but have turned to Wilkie in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Assistance to China Wins Hearts and Minds</p>
<p>According to observers from various sectors of the American community, although Wilkie has promised to continue the current government's policies in the Far East, this is still a promise that has not been translated into action. President Roosevelt has indeed taken steps, wielding a "big stick" to aid Chongqing, to alleviate the overall situation in China, and to contain Japanese aggression. On the surface, the American community is quite disturbed by the State Department's evacuation plan, but other than some minor complaints, the impact on the American community in the Far East's attitude towards Roosevelt is minimal. This is because the American community sees the overall situation as serious and recognizes the evacuation as a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Predicting the Result: Four to One</p>
<p>There are also a small number who view the evacuation advice as a clever tactic of the Republican campaign. Last night, many members of the American community bet money on the election results, with Republicans who firmly believed that Roosevelt would be elected even betting four to one that President Roosevelt would win, but there were no people betting on Wilkie's victory by betting more against less. It is said that the amounts wagered were not large.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Nuona Jing She to Organize Winter Disaster Relief <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>As the depths of winter approach, the poor are suffering from hunger and cold, which is extremely pitiful. The members of the Nuona Jing She in Shanghai, based on the Buddhist spirit of compassion, have initiated disaster relief efforts and have already organized a committee, electing Tang Huiying as the director. They are dividing the work into groups and actively carrying out the work. They have also advanced funds and pre-ordered 2,000 pieces of relief clothing and various other foods in preparation for distribution. It is said that the Dharani mantra power of the Jing She is inconceivable. Before distribution, they must recite sutras and bless the items.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Bloody Incident Occurred in Hongkou Yesterday: Japanese Military Officer Assassinated. The Deceased Was Japanese Navy Ensign Sho Nakamura. North Jiangxi Road Remained Under Heavy Guard Until Midnight. <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Near North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, at around 2:45 PM yesterday, a sudden assassination occurred. The victim was a Japanese Navy Ensign named Sho Nakamura. As he was passing through the area, someone suddenly appeared behind him with a gun and opened fire, hitting him in a vital spot. The Japanese Ensign was carrying his own handgun and tried to draw it in retaliation, but failed. After achieving their goal, the assailant fled without a trace. After receiving the news, the Japanese immediately dispatched a large contingent of Japanese military police to guard the area. They immediately cut off traffic and conducted a large-scale search, creating an unusually tense situation. After the incident, the Hongkou Police Department also dispatched red patrol cars carrying a large number of Chinese and Western detectives to assist in apprehending the perpetrator. The Japanese Ensign was immediately taken to a Japanese hospital for treatment, but died soon after due to the severity of his injuries. The location of the incident remained heavily guarded until midnight, preventing residents from entering and exiting. The perpetrator is still unknown.</p>
<p>Another Bloody Incident</p>
<p>At the home of Japanese national Jotaro Takahashi, located at 222 Dongyang Street, Disweiyi Road, Hongkou, around 12:00 AM the night before last, four or five people armed with sharp knives and axes broke in through a window on the upper floor. Using the sharp weapons, they repeatedly slashed the husband and wife in the chest and abdomen dozens of times, killing them both on the spot. The floorboards were covered in blood, dripping down below. The assailants seized all the precious metals and gold bonds from the house and escaped. There was also a Yangzhou maid in the house, but she was sound asleep and did not wake up. When she got up in the morning, she smelled blood everywhere. She went upstairs and was shocked to see that her masters had both been killed, lying in pools of blood. She rushed out to scream for help, and nearby residents gathered.</p>

<p>According to information received yesterday, Mr. Baker, the director of the China-Foreign Relief Association, is currently preparing to transport 100 tons of medicine to Free China via the Burma Road. It is reported that Mr. Baker has already departed from the United States by Clipper flying boat, while the batch of medicines, including a large quantity of quinine, is being transported by ship to Rangoon. This quinine is like timely rain to the medical authorities in Yunnan who are working to prevent malaria. In addition to quinine, it is reported that there are also large quantities of gauze bandages and other medical supplies.</p>

<p>Important Announcement from the Adjustment Association to All Sectors: Participate in Group Rice Purchases to Prevent Disconnection in the Event of Changing Circumstances</p>
<p>The Shanghai Food Adjustment Association respectfully announced to all sectors yesterday, stating that the Association was organized by enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life in Shanghai with the aim of promoting group rice purchases by all sectors to regulate the city's food supply. Since its establishment, more than 610 units, including various industrial and commercial groups, companies, and firms, have entrusted the Association to directly order foreign rice on their behalf, totaling 27 batches and over 61,000 bags. The Association has also indirectly promoted self-ordering of foreign rice by various sectors, amounting to hundreds of thousands of bags. This work is all done on a voluntary basis, which is well known to all. Now that new grain has been harvested, due to various reasons,</p>
<p>Supply is Not Abundant</p>
<p>In the future, the city's food supply will inevitably still rely on foreign rice for supplementation. However, the international situation is unpredictable, and the future of transportation and exchange rates are all problematic. Therefore, taking advantage of the current loose foreign exchange, smooth transportation, and relatively cheap prices of foreign rice, this announcement is made with the utmost sincerity, hoping that all sectors will make plans as early as possible to avoid being unprepared at the last minute. The Association also hopes for enthusiastic participation and entrustment of orders. The ordering method is at least 50 bags each time, with a deposit of 40 yuan in foreign currency per bag. Application forms can be obtained from the Association or the Trust Department of Jin Cheng Bank on Jiangxi Road, so that the city's rice reserves</p>
<p>Will Gradually Become Abundant</p>
<p>and rice prices will become increasingly stable, which will not only benefit oneself but also greatly benefit others. The future of the food supply depends on this," and so on. All sectors wishing to participate in rice purchases can go directly to Room 311, 3rd Floor, YMCA, Eight Immortals Bridge to register. The Association expressed its extreme welcome, as the long-term stability of the entire food supply in Shanghai still depends on the city's residents automatically</p>
<p>Ordering Foreign Rice</p>
<p>and transporting it to Shanghai for storage, so that there is preparedness. The Association also hopes for enthusiastic participation in the group ordering of foreign rice organized by the Shanghai Food Adjustment Association. At the same time, it suggests that, except for large factories that require a large amount of rice daily and have relatively abundant capital to order large quantities of foreign rice individually, all shops with relatively small capital and scope should have their respective trade associations handle the registration procedures on their behalf. Once a certain amount has been collected, the Food Adjustment Association can also be entrusted to place the order on their behalf. Do Not</p>
<p>Rely on Rice Shops</p>
<p>As for employees of various institutions and organizations, they should immediately participate in the group ordering of foreign rice organized by their respective institutions and organizations. However, for individual rice purchases by citizens, it is hoped that the Food Association will improve the rice purchasing methods, such as reducing the deposit amount or redefining the purchase quantity to one bag or half a bag, so that group rice purchases can be popularized throughout the city. At the same time, it is hoped that the authorities of the two concessions will accept the recommendations of the Shanghai Rice Evaluation Committee and promptly advise residents within their respective jurisdictions to plan to participate in group ordering of foreign rice. If this is delayed any longer, once drastic changes occur at home and abroad, the source of foreign rice will be difficult to continue. At that time, speculative rice merchants will take the opportunity to stir up trouble, and the livelihood of ordinary people will be difficult, and the public security within the concession will be in a precarious situation.</p>
<p>Police Department Rectifies Measuring Instruments</p>
<p>According to the Municipal Council, the Police Department of the Council has dispatched personnel to investigate the measuring instruments used in various shops within the concession from October 16th to 31st. As a result, 27 shops were investigated, and 44 scales were inspected. Among them, 25 were found to be non-compliant. Legal action or warnings were taken accordingly, and orders were given to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>Greek Nationals Enlist, Transportation Inconvenient, Departure Temporarily Difficult, Relief Fund Already Raised 60,000</p>
<p>The Greek Relief Fund, initiated by the Greek Consulate General in this city to assist wartime refugees, has raised over 60,000 yuan as of yesterday. The Greek Consul General, Mr. Yenoulatos, expressed his gratitude to the Greek nationals in this city and other foreigners who donated. Since the invasion of Greece by Italy, the Greek Consulate General in this city has gathered enthusiastic Greek nationals every day requesting to return to their country to enlist in the army, but there are currently no neutral ships sailing to Greece, so departure is not possible. In the future, as soon as transportation is possible, the Greek authorities will allow them to return to their country to serve.</p>
<p>Defeat of the Italian Army</p>
<p>According to a neutral observer of the European war situation, the recent Italian offensive against Greece has been met with united resistance from the Greek people, and the political situation has suffered a setback. According to news reports, Greek troops have advanced several miles into the Albanian border. The German and Italian sides initially did not expect the Greek people to be so fond of their freedom. Now they are planning to use German forces to achieve results that</p>
<p>Cannot be Obtained</p>
<p>The observer said that this plan will be as unlikely as their previous prediction that Greece could be easily obtained. Moreover, British troops are fulfilling their promise to land in Greece, and the Abyssinian militia is still resisting the Italian army. Former King Selassie is currently in Sudan, meeting with Albanian leaders. Since Albania was occupied by Italy, it has deeply hoped for an opportunity to cooperate with the British army to restore its territory. The British troops' landing in Greece will greatly boost morale, and the future trend will gradually become clear. Italy's ambition to seize Greece will only prove to be a futile effort.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Withdraw from the Canidrome</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," when British troops withdrew two months ago, there was talk that Japanese troops would take over the defense of western Shanghai. The original site of the Canidrome on Great Western Road was occupied by Japanese troops and converted into a barracks. It is now learned that the Japanese troops there have withdrawn and been transferred to Fahua Town next to Columbia Road. The original site of the Canidrome will be converted into a "Western Funeral Home" today (5th). The old Canidrome signs have all been removed. It has been learned that there are two former gambling venues in the "Badlands" of western Shanghai that have been converted into funeral homes. The other is the former Willdon gambling venue on Yuyuan Road, which has now been converted into the "Zhaofeng" Funeral Home. According to Chinese sources, both funeral homes were established by Lu Ying.</p>
<p>Typhoon Rapidly Approaching, Shanghai Gradually Threatened</p>
<p>The Zikawei Observatory has learned that a violent typhoon that occurred near Guam Island in the Pacific Ocean had reached 15 degrees north latitude and 137 degrees east longitude at 6:00 a.m. yesterday, according to a report from the Zikawei Observatory. The wind direction is north-northwest, and the center is within 120 nautical miles. The coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are gradually being threatened. The temperature in Shanghai yesterday reached a high of 82 degrees and a low of 70.2 degrees, which was unusually hot. However, as the northern high pressure approaches, the weather will turn cold.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Use 500,000 Yuan to Purchase Five Portuguese Ships, Seized for More Than a Year on the Pretext of Unclear Nationality</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, five Portuguese merchant ships seized by the Japanese in the Zhejiang Sea on April 5th of last year have been detained near the "Fish Market Association" in Yangshupu, moored at buoys No. 30 and 31 of the Huangpu River. During this period, the Portuguese Consul General, Alves, has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, but the Japanese have not released the ships, citing unclear nationality. It is now learned that the five Portuguese ships, which have been detained for more than a year, have been forcibly purchased by Japanese merchants for 500,000 yuan in national currency, and the formal transfer of ownership will be completed in the next few days. The five Portuguese ships, including the "Fule," "Libao," "Meile," and the steamship "Feiside," and the paddle steamer "Pengba," which originally sailed on the Shanghai-Ou line and the Ningbo-Dinghai line, all had a net tonnage of 300 to 600 tons. When coastal shipping was smooth, they all sailed in coastal ports and were quite active. It has been learned that last spring, Japanese warships repeatedly seized foreign ships in the Zhejiang Sea, totaling more than ten ships, including the Portuguese ships "Tang Sai," "Tang Bei," "Tang Qiao," "Li Shi," "Fule," and the German ship "Feikang." Subsequently, after negotiations with the Japanese side by the Portuguese and German consuls, most of them have been released one after another, while several ships were forcibly purchased by the Japanese at reduced prices. The five ships, including "Li Shi," were seized on the pretext of unclear nationality, which required further investigation, and have been detained until now and forcibly purchased by Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>French Consul General Denies Dissolution of White Russian Unit</p>
<p>According to a Havas News Agency report from this city on the 5th, regarding the news report that the French Concession authorities were about to dissolve the White Russian Auxiliary Police Force of the Police Department and dismiss Jewish employees of the Municipal Council, the French Consul General in this city, Mr. Magre, recently issued an official statement denying it. It stated: "Today, several newspapers published a news report, claiming that the French Concession authorities intend to dissolve the White Russian Auxiliary Police Force and dismiss Jewish employees of the Municipal Council. I hereby solemnly deny this and declare that the French Concession authorities have never considered such measures. The White Russian Auxiliary Police Force has always been extremely diligent, and their loyalty and enthusiasm in service are beyond reproach. At this time of difficulty, we can only be grateful to the team. It can be seen that the news reported by various newspapers is not only absurd but also serves other purposes. The French Concession authorities hereby take this opportunity to inform the local press not to be misled by such rumors." (Note: This newspaper did not publish this news.)</p>
<p>Armistice Day, British Nationals Celebrate, Lay Wreaths, Hold Banquets, Special Services on Sunday</p>
<p>According to the "Continental Times," November 11th is the anniversary of the Armistice of the World War. It is reported that on this day, British and French nationals living in Shanghai will celebrate their victory in the war separately. On the British side, at 3:30 p.m., the British Victory Association, on behalf of various British associations in Shanghai, will hold a special banquet at the club in the HSBC Building. In the afternoon, refreshments will be provided to members of the Central Overseas Women's Federation. On Sunday morning, November 10th, a memorial service will be held at the Union Church on Jiangxi Road. The time and details will be announced later. The French nationals in this city will also commemorate the day without much fanfare, only holding a service at the Sacred Heart Church at No. 36, rue des Pères, and will not lay wreaths. It is expected that the French troops stationed in Shanghai will not hold drills.</p>
<p>Northern Defense Area of the Central District Taken Over by the Police Department, Only Baoshan Road and the First Special Court Still Defended by the Volunteer Corps</p>
<p>The Shanghai Volunteer Corps has taken over the British military defense area in the northern part of the central district of the Public Concession for two months and ten days. However, when the Shanghai Volunteer Corps took over the northern defense area of the central district, according to the method of the British garrison in Shanghai, the northern part of the central district was divided into six small defense areas, namely: (1) the intersection of North Henan Road and Baoshan Road, (2) Qianjiang Guild Hall, (3) Kaifeng Road, (4) the dry bridge at the end of North Zhejiang Road, (5) the First Special District Local Court on North Zhejiang Road, (6) the iron gate on North Xizang Road. Among them, the Qianjiang Guild Hall and Kaifeng Road defense areas were the first to be abandoned, followed by the dry bridge defense area at the end of North Zhejiang Road, which was also abandoned and handed over to the patrol police of the Municipal Council's Police Department. However, according to news received yesterday, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Command has also abandoned the Xizang Road iron gate defense area and handed it over to the patrol police for patrol. Thus, since taking over the northern part of the central district, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps has abandoned four out of six defense areas in its northern area. However, it is still responsible for defending the defense area at the intersection of Baoshan Road at the end of North Henan Road and the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road. The reason for this is still difficult to ascertain. According to informed sources, the reason why the Volunteer Corps abandoned the four defense areas is that the patrol police of the police department can maintain the security of the defense areas.</p>
<p>Seized Greek Ship Released Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," the Greek cargo ship "Coulouras Xenos" was seized by the Japanese Navy near the Jiutuan (transliteration) lightship outside the port on Saturday evening. After mutual consultation between the Greek and Japanese authorities in this city, the ship was released yesterday morning (5th) and sailed back to Shanghai. According to Mr. Yenoulatos, the Greek Consul in Shanghai, the ship was seized due to a misunderstanding. He then began negotiations with the Japanese authorities here for the release of the ship, which proceeded smoothly. It is reported that the ship, with a deadweight of 8,300 tons, sailed from Shanghai to a port in South China on Saturday morning. Shortly after leaving the port, it was discovered that the ship was only carrying ballast. The shipowner ordered it to return to Shanghai. On Saturday evening, the ship approached Wusongkou and was suddenly ordered to stop by a Japanese warship, which then seized it. The Greek Consul immediately received a report and consulted with the Japanese authorities. The consultation was completed last night (4th), and the ship was released.</p>
<p>Thrift Promotion Week Enthusiastically Prepared</p>
<p>The first anniversary of the establishment of the National Thrift and Savings Movement Committee will be on November 10th. The authorities have stipulated that the National Thrift and Savings Propaganda Week will be held from the 10th to the 16th. The two general associations of the Thrift and Savings Committee and the Savings Promotion Committee have instructed all branch associations and savings promotion groups across the country to mobilize jointly. Party and government agencies and industrial, commercial, cultural, and vocational groups in all provinces, cities, and counties across the country have also generally participated in the preparations. The situation at that time will be unprecedentedly enthusiastic. In order to adapt to the convenience of the national people to participate in savings, the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has followed the order of the Ministry to open savings businesses in all of the more than 3,000 post offices and postal agencies across the country within the year. The Central Trust Bureau and the China Communications and Agriculture Banks have also followed the method of establishing simple savings offices generally passed by the Joint Council of the Four Banks, and began to prepare for the establishment of simple savings offices in mining areas with many workers, cultural areas with concentrated schools, production areas or distribution centers for large-scale special products, and ports with prosperous commerce and more currency circulation, in order to promote the widespread promotion of the thrift movement. According to sources in the travel industry, water-land intermodal transport has now been arranged between Jinhua and Yongjia, and the journey takes two days. The intermodal transport vehicle departs at 5:00 a.m. every morning, and the buses to Lishui have also been advanced by one hour, with two shifts at 5:00 a.m. and 12:00 p.m.</p>

<p>Police Department Deputy Chief Yao Ke Resigns to Go to Australia, He Has Left Shanghai for a Short Vacation, His Vacancy Seems Likely to Be Filled by Robertson</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury," it was learned from reliable sources this morning (5th) that Yao Ke, Deputy Chief of the Police Department of the Municipal Council and head of the Political Section, who has served in the Police Department for nearly 28 years, has recently resigned and will go to Australia to retire. Yao Ke left Shanghai today for a short vacation, but he may not return to Shanghai when his vacation is over. Instead, he will go to Australia to reunite with his family. It is reported that two months ago today, on September 6th, Yao Ke was suddenly attacked by two thugs when he left his residence on Yuyuan Road to go to the General Patrol House. Yao Ke bravely fought back and escaped unharmed. The thugs fled in different directions when the plan was exposed. It is reported that Yao Ke is from Nottingham, England, is 48 years old, and arrived in Shanghai from England in 1902. Shortly thereafter, he joined the Police Department and served in a low-level position. Because of his effective work, he gradually rose in rank and managed the "B" police district for several years. Three years ago, he was appointed as the director of the Political Section. His successor has not yet been appointed, but it is generally expected that Robertson, the head of the Criminal Section, who also handles matters related to the Political Section, will soon officially take over Yao Ke's vacancy.</p>

<p>Goods Imported and Exported from the Concession Are Obstructed by the Japanese Army, Attempting to Monopolize Commerce in the Occupied Areas, Chinese and Foreign Merchants Alike Suffer Damage</p>
<p>The Japanese Army in China has recently been carrying out a large-scale "plan" to control commercial goods due to a lack of war funds. The prohibition of the entry and exit of commodities in this city is the realization of this plan, which has lasted for two months, causing commerce in the concession to be almost at a standstill, and all commerce in the occupied areas has been deprived.</p>
<p>Products of the Concession Prohibited from Exporting</p>
<p>According to the Pingming News Agency's investigation with several merchants, Japanese sentries at the border of the concession prohibit any goods from being transported out, especially the export of piece goods, sugar, and cigarettes. Currently, the Japanese army does not allow finished pieces of cloth to be carried out of the concession, causing the business of various weaving factories and cotton cloth shops in this city to plummet, and they will be difficult to maintain. However, this move by the Japanese army has also put Japanese spinning mills in a difficult situation. Currently, the Japanese spinning mills in this city have first reduced the number of night shifts, so starting from the fourth day of the previous month, they only operate day shifts for five days a week.</p>
<p>British and Dutch Sugar Cannot Be Sold</p>
<p>In addition, the Japanese army also restricts the export of sugar, and the British and Dutch merchants are the most affected by this significant loss. The supply of sugar in the occupied areas of central China mostly relies on the British and Dutch, but now they are prohibited by the Japanese army from being transported to various ports along the Yangtze River, and they cannot operate. The British and Dutch sugar merchants have appealed to their respective governments for negotiations. At the same time, according to Chinese from the occupied areas, the source of sugar in the occupied areas has been cut off. Not only has the price soared, but there are some places where there is no sugar to buy. In addition, other seafood products are in the same situation due to the prohibition of exports, which will soon make it impossible for southern goods stores in the occupied areas to operate.</p>
<p>Agricultural Products Prohibited from Exporting</p>
<p>As for agricultural products in the occupied areas, the Japanese army also prohibits their export, forcing the main commerce in the occupied areas to a standstill, causing extreme panic among merchants both inside and outside the concession. It is reported that the Japanese army's move is an attempt to monopolize all commerce in its occupied areas, and use this special profit to make up for its insufficient military expenses.</p>
<p>Police Capture Robbers in a Fight, Stray Bullets Kill and Injure Five People, Zhaofeng Rice Shop on Chengdu Road Robbed Yesterday, One Robber Killed on the Spot, Three Captured Alive</p>
<p>At 1:45 p.m. yesterday, a robbery occurred at 842 Lane, North Chengdu Road. Fortunately, the hostess was alert and climbed onto the drying terrace to report to the police. Nearby police officers heard the news and surrounded the area to arrest the robbers. As a result, one robber was killed, and five men and women were killed and injured by stray bullets. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Zhaofeng Rice Shop Suddenly Attacked by Robbers</p>
<p>The Zhaofeng Rice Shop at No. 4, Qingyu Lane, 842 Lane, North Chengdu Road, is run by Zhu Xinfen from Huzhou. The business is doing well. At 1:45 p.m. yesterday, a robber dressed in a dark khaki suit went to the shop and knocked on the door. Apprentice Qian Zhenhua (15 years old, from Changshu) answered the door. The robber asked if Mr. Zhu was at home. Qian replied that he was not. He then asked if the accountant, Yang Yongxi, was there. Qian replied that he was out. At this time, five robbers following behind, dressed differently, took out pistols and threatened the apprentice, forbidding him to make a sound. At the same time, Huang Jinyao (16 years old, local), an apprentice from the Chengda Rice Mill in the same industry, was about to leave the rice shop after settling accounts when he was stopped by the robbers and not allowed to leave.</p>
<p>Hostess Hears the Alarm, Flees to a Neighbor's House</p>
<p>Fortunately, Zhu's daughter-in-law, Ms. Zhu, 20 years old, was looking out of the window on the upper floor. When she saw that the robbers were all holding pistols, she knew they were not good people. She quickly turned around and told her aunt, Ms. Shen (38 years old), who quickly climbed onto the drying terrace on the roof, crossed over to the terrace at No. 9 next door, and ran down, intending to go out and use the telephone to report to the police. The neighbor noticed that she looked flustered, fearing that she was about to commit suicide, so he followed and asked her, and at the same time knocked on the back door to notify her children and grandchildren to prevent unexpected events from happening. At this time, the robbers in the room were driving the two apprentices to the attic on the second floor. Two robbers broke into the pavilion and grabbed more than 50 yuan in cash from the drawer of the desk, intending to intimidate the owner, Zhu Xinfen, and force him to hand over the key to the safe. One of the robbers on the stairs</p>
<p>Heard the Urgent Sound at the Back Door, Knowing That Something Was Wrong, He Shouted to Leave Quickly. So the Robbers Pushed Downstairs, Trying to Escape Through the Front Door.</p>
<p>Gunfire Erupts, One Robber Killed</p>
<p>At that time, Huang Jinyao, an apprentice from the Chengda Rice Mill, had a bicycle still placed in the patio, which one of the robbers rode away. When the robbers went out, the two apprentices followed behind. As soon as they went out of the lane, Huang Jinyao blew the whistle. Nearby police officers heard the alarm and gathered from all directions to surround and arrest the robbers. The robbers knew they had been exposed, so they turned into Meibike Road from Shanhai Pass Road and fled to Aiwengi Road. The police officers chasing from behind were close behind. Two police officers standing opposite the Xinzha Police Station also assisted in the arrest. The robbers took the initiative to fire their guns to resist arrest. The police also fired back. It is reported that Police Officer No. 811 fired four shots, No. 2702 fired five shots, No. 1384 fired four shots, and No. 2351 fired six shots. Gunfire erupted for a while, and passersby fled in panic. As a result, one robber dressed in a gray suit was shot six times by the police. All the shots hit vital points and he fell to the ground and died immediately.</p>
<p>One Killed by Stray Bullet, Four Injured in Total</p>
<p>When the robbers and police officers were fighting, stray bullets flew around, killing and injuring five men and women. One old woman, in her fifties, was shot in the left rib, penetrating the right rib, and died on the spot, falling in front of the Jixiangtai Teahouse at Nos. 301-2. Four other passersby were injured: Kuai Binglin, 20 years old, resident of No. 184, Meibike Road, clerk at Zhang Baixing Shoe Store, shot in the left arm by a stray bullet; Gu Hesan, 41 years old, from Tongzhou, carriage driver, shot in the left shoulder; Yu Jinqi, 24 years old, student at Datong University, shot in the left shoulder, the bullet did not pass through, resident of No. 28, Wender Lane, Hartong Road; Lin Zhengquan, 27 years old, from Pudong, resident of No. 1250, Xiaoshadu Road, Aiwengi Road, injured in the right leg. When the reporter rushed to investigate, he saw blood splattered everywhere and the smell was pungent. At the same time, after the police officers bravely arrested the robbers, they arrested three robbers on the spot and detained them in the Xinzha Police Station for investigation. The four people injured by stray bullets were sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. The bodies of the two men and women were sent to the coroner's office for examination. The body of the old woman who was killed by mistake was photographed to wait for her family to claim it.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Appeals in the Case of the Sudden Death of the Head Nurse, Investigation Court Opened Yesterday, Rescheduled for Further Review</p>
<p>Li Yuying (also known as Jie Ru), a female head nurse from Fujian at the Sino-Western Sanatorium at No. 536, Pushi Road, suddenly died in her room in the hospital on the evening of the Dragon Boat Festival on June 10th of this year. At 10:00 a.m. the next morning, her nephew, Li Konglan, discovered her death and reported it to Lu Zhenqing (39 years old, from Beiping, son of the hospital director, Lu Zhong'an), the administrator of the hospital, who sent Doctor Lin Zhengliang (38 years old, from Ningbo, graduate of the Dahan University) to examine her and determine that she had</p>
<p>Died of a Stroke. Lin then issued a certificate, notified the China Funeral Home on Haig Road, and sent the body</p>
<p>To the funeral home, and the coffin was temporarily placed in the funeral home, and a tomb was found in the Hongqiao Cemetery and a date was being set for burial, when suddenly someone named Lei Huayun sent letters to the French Police Station, the Medical Office, the Second Special Court, the Fujian Fellow Association, etc., secretly reporting that Li Yuying had died suddenly and inexplicably, requesting an investigation and arbitration. The Police Department</p>
<p>Reported to the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office, and the coffin was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan branch,</p>
<p>And an autopsy was performed, and it was determined that she had died of "acute heart failure." However, when the deceased died suddenly, Lu and Lin did not report to the police station in accordance with the regulations of the concession hospitals, so there was a suspicion of falsifying the certificate. In addition to the French Municipal Council imposing a fine, Prosecutor Zhao Weimin also prosecuted Lu for the crime of instigating the falsification of evidence in accordance with the first and second paragraphs of Article 165 of the Criminal Law, and prosecuted Lin for the crime of falsifying evidence in accordance with the first paragraph of Article 165. Zhu Chuzhe, a criminal judge of the Second Special Court,</p>
<p>After Trial, Found Lu Zhenqing and Lin Zhengliang Not Guilty. The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Now the Prosecutor's Office has appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, and the deceased's father, Li Shizhen, has also submitted a written appeal, requesting that the body be re-examined. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shan Wangyue of the court visited the Third Court to open an investigation court. The prosecutor did not arrive, and the two defendants, Lu and Lin, still hired Shan Yuhua and Ling Changyan, two lawyers, to defend them. According to the two defense lawyers, the prosecutor's</p>
<p>Reasons for Prosecution Were Not Stated in Detail, but Were Vague and Ambiguous, So the First Instance's Judgment of Not Guilty Was Quite Appropriate. They Also Presented a Precedent from the Supreme Court for the Court to Refer to. The Court then Interrogated the Two Defendants, Lu and Lin, and Li Shizhen, and Then Concluded That the Case Still Needed to Be Investigated and Rescheduled for Hearing. Today's Court Transcript Can Be Copied by the Defense Lawyers at the Court Tomorrow, the Judgment Was Concluded and the Court Adjourned.</p>
<p>Conflict Arises from Teasing Women, Annamite Police Fire Gun, Zhu Hua Shot in the Leg, Zhu Brothers Arrested</p>
<p>Zhu Shu, a middle school student, 18 years old, rented a room at No. 10, Remi Lane, Dangmi Road. After school at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, he was walking home when he encountered a young woman on West Aixians Road, Ratou Road. She was dressed fashionably and had a thin appearance. Zhu followed her and teased her along the way, which attracted the attention of passersby and a verbal argument arose. At that time, Police Officer No. 579 from Annam arrived after hearing the news and inquired about everything. Zhu was young and energetic and conflicted with the police officer, and then resorted to violence. Soon, his brother, Zhu Hua, also arrived after hearing the alarm and helped his brother grab the Annamite police officer and beat him severely. As a result, the police officer fired a shot, hitting Zhu Hua in the right leg, and blood flowed non-stop. Later, other police officers arrived and arrested the Zhu brothers for investigation.</p>
<p>Tang's Valuables Stolen, More Than Ten Boxes of Antiques and Silverware Stolen, Two Russian Criminals Arrested and Sentenced</p>
<p>After Mr. Tang Shaoyi, a former important figure in the Kuomintang, was assassinated, his wife moved to Hong Kong and deposited valuable antiques, silverware, clothing, etc. at Madeng Warehouse, No. 147, Yangshu Road. Suddenly, a large number of Russian thieves managed to break into the warehouse at night and steal valuable items. On the 25th of last month, Indian Police Officer No. 33 of the Huishan Police Station arrested two Russians, Abai Laiheng Kangfu and Paidai Erhan Weihok, near the warehouse. At that time, the two men were carrying a large number of valuable silverware, tablecloths, bedding, etc. and were taken to the police station on the same day. After investigation by Chinese Detective Huang Fugen, it was found that they were stolen from Mrs. Tang's belongings deposited at the Madeng Warehouse. However, after investigation, it was found that 11 boxes of the dozens of boxes of items sent by the Tang family had been stolen, and the loss was impossible to estimate at the time. Yesterday morning, the two criminals were sent to Criminal Court No. 4 of the Second Special Court. Police lawyers Qian Xunjiu and Peng Qixin prosecuted them according to law, while the criminals hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. After Judge Meng questioned them and confirmed the facts, he sentenced A to one year in prison and Pai to four months in prison. The stolen goods were returned to the owner.</p>
<p>Colluding with Japanese Men and Women, Arrested for Extortion</p>
<p>Zhu Ruifu, a local resident living at No. 1, Lane 157, Huanlong Road, in the French Concession, runs a coal ball business and has a small amount of money. Five days ago, Chen Qinglin, an acquaintance, suddenly called Zhu and claimed that he was going to sue him for 50,000 yuan. On the previous day (3rd), he sent another telegram asking how the money was. If Zhu did not agree, a Japanese person would go to his house to arrest him. After hearing this, Zhu ignored it. At about 8:00 a.m. yesterday, Chen led a Japanese man and woman to Zhu's house, making a threatening scene. His wife knew that something was wrong, so she sneaked out the back door and reported to Police Officer No. 164, who reported to the Lujiawan Central Police Station, and a large number of detectives rushed to the scene and arrested the criminals. The Japanese men and women were transferred to the Japanese Consulate for questioning.</p>
<p>Plaintiff Not Paying Court Fees, Assaults Lawyer</p>
<p>Liu Qingyuan from Shandong is one of the partners of Taiyuan Fruit and Grocery Store. This spring, he hired lawyer Zhao Zuwei (resident of No. 12, Yongnian Lane, Buck Road) from Zhuji to clear the store's accounts, stating that the fee would be 200 yuan, 100 yuan to be paid first, and the remaining 100 yuan to be paid after the closing. Unexpectedly, after the clearance was completed, Liu ignored it. Zhao then filed a lawsuit against Liu in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting payment of the fee. The court ruled in favor of the payment. Yesterday morning, Judge Lu opened Civil Court No. 5 to enforce the ruling. Liu had no money to pay. Zhao requested the sealing of Liu's residence at No. 36, Xuehua Lane, Xuehua Road. The court approved the request. Unexpectedly, after leaving the court, Liu grabbed Zhao and beat him, causing Zhao's glasses to fall off and his face to be bruised. The police officer on duty took Liu to the police station for investigation before sending him to the court for trial.</p>

<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that Mr. Lee赖氏, the father of Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China's wife (i.e., the Ambassador's wife), is a renowned lawyer from Chile, South America. He recently arrived in Shanghai to visit his daughter. According to Mr. Lee, whom the reporter interviewed, among the cities he has seen, Shanghai is the most vibrant, surpassing even New York. He is deeply interested in the lives of the Chinese people. Before coming to Shanghai, he briefly resided in Beiping, viewing the scenery, but soon departed, much to his regret. He originally intended to stay in Shanghai for several days before embarking on a global tour, but due to the current situation, he had to hastily begin his journey. He will depart tomorrow (6th) on the President Coolidge for South America.</p>

<p>Previously, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, due to the Vietnamese authorities' cancellation of permits for Chinese goods in transit returning from Hong Kong to Shanghai, telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Consulate in Saigon, and the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce to vigorously advocate for the restoration of these permits. The Chamber has now received a telegram from the Ministry of Economic Affairs stating that the matter has been forwarded to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review and direct response.</p>
<h3 id="e78">French Concession Water and Electricity Increase Prices Again - Still Hoping for Prevention - Company Has Annual Surplus - Merchants and Residents Can't Bear the Burden <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The French-owned Water and Electricity Company of this city, in October of last year, citing foreign exchange shortages and rising prices, increased electricity rates by 60%, water rates by 10%, and tram and bus fares by 17%. The general populace found the increased burden difficult to bear. Recently, the company, again citing increased expenses, submitted a request to the French Municipal Council at the end of last month to increase prices. The Board of Directors of the Council discussed and approved it.</p>
<p>After receiving this approval, the company invalidated all previous fee schedules yesterday and announced new prices as follows: The electricity rates for lighting, power, and heating increased by 97% (including the previous 60% increase); water rates increased by 30% (including the previous 10%). The two items above were to be implemented today, following the new prices. As for the fare increase for trams, trolleybuses, and buses, the company has submitted the original prices and proposed increase tables to the French Municipal Council. The Council is currently</p>
<p>still reviewing these, with approval expected around the 10th of this month. The exact increase amount is unknown but will be posted on each vehicle two days before implementation to inform the public. The reason given by the company for this increase in water and electricity fares is that the cost of living has recently risen, employee subsidies have increased, and gasoline and rubber prices have soared. The current increases are still lower than those in the International Settlement, but the general populace believes that the company has had excellent business and significant surpluses in recent years and hopes that the authorities can prevent the increases so that the residents of the French Concession do not find life even more difficult.</p>

<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Shanghai Postal Administration, the upcoming recruitment exam for Grade B postal workers, totaling over 200 positions, is for the bureau's own hiring purposes and is not a proxy exam. The exam date is still under consideration and will be announced two weeks in advance to allow interested postal workers from various locations to participate.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Over 200 More American Nationals - Depart Shanghai Tomorrow Morning to Return Home - President Coolidge Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon - Plenty of Cabin Space on Two Other Special Vessels <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The American President Lines' President Coolidge, arriving from Manila via Hong Kong on its journey back to the US, docked at buoys 11 and 12 in the Huangpu River at 5 PM yesterday. It is reported that over 70 people disembarked in Shanghai, while the rest were mostly American nationals evacuating from various parts of the Far East. According to the shipping company, the Coolidge is scheduled to leave Shanghai tomorrow morning, heading for Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and then San Francisco. Over 200 American nationals from this port are evacuating on this vessel.</p>
<p>Two More Vessels - Dedicated to Evacuation</p>
<p>It is also said that the second evacuation vessel, the Mariposa, will leave Shanghai on the 10th, and the third, the Washington, is scheduled to leave on the 21st. These two vessels will exclusively carry evacuating American nationals back to the US, and it is expected that there will be very few empty seats. There is currently some space available in the first-class cabins of the Mariposa and the second and third-class cabins of the Washington. Most of the second and third-class cabins on the Mariposa have been pre-booked by American nationals from North China and Korea. After leaving Shanghai, the Mariposa will travel via North China and Korea, it is said. It is also understood that American nationals will also be evacuating on the Japanese NYK Line's Kazan Maru, sailing from Shanghai to San Francisco on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>Some American Nationals - Requesting Assistance</p>
<p>According to the US Consulate General, they have received inquiries from 25 American nationals expressing a need for government assistance to purchase passage home. It is expected that the total will reach 150 people, but some of them will only request partial assistance. The Consulate will conduct investigations into those requesting assistance to ensure prudence. Therefore, the Consulate cannot act hastily, but will ensure that genuinely impoverished American nationals can return home on American President Lines vessels within the next few weeks. According to an official, "We are following the State Department's policy and are very willing to see non-essential American nationals leave Shanghai, but we are determined not to adopt incentives to encourage their evacuation."</p>
<h3 id="e81">Soviet Nationals to Celebrate Tomorrow - October Revolution Anniversary - Grand Celebrations to be Held for Five Consecutive Days - With Two Screenings of Award-Winning Feature Films <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow marks the 23rd anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. As the Soviet-埃 General Association at 805 Avenue Foch is too small, Soviet nationals will hold a grand celebration at the YWCA on Bubbling Well Road, including dancing, music, and film screenings. The celebration will last for five consecutive days. As the Soviet Union has no diplomatic representation in Shanghai, there will be no receptions for foreign guests and nationals. The schedule for the five-day celebration is as follows: Tomorrow at 9 PM, Soviet nationals will hold a special meeting, followed by a lecture, a concert, and a grand dance party. On Friday (the 8th) at 9 PM, Soviet newsreels and the recently released Soviet "award-winning" film will be screened. On Saturday (the 9th), the award-winning film "Lenin in 1918" will be screened. On Sunday (the 9th) at 3 PM, a children's matinee film will be screened. On Monday (the 11th), there will be another concert and dance party. White Russian newspapers and pro-Soviet Russian-language newspapers will publish special editions.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Acceptance, Discount, and Rediscount - Not Implemented in Shanghai <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance announced the provisional measures for promoting bank acceptance and discount business, the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Farmers Bank of China, and local bankers' associations have been ordered to comply. Regarding the Shanghai Settlement area, there has long been the establishment of a bank note acceptance office, handling bank acceptance note business, which is unrelated to the measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance. The reason is that Shanghai's situation is unique, so it will not be implemented for the time being. The Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China accepting rediscounts will also be postponed in Shanghai.</p>
